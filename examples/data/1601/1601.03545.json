The phenomenon\noccurs due to coupling between normal and rotational\ndegrees-of-freedom such that the effective normal force becomes\nattractive rather than repulsive. Despite a rich literature, the\nforward evolution problem remains unsolved other than in certain\nrestricted cases in 2D with single contact points.  Various practical\nconsequences of the theory are revisited, including models for robotic\nmanipulators, and the strange behaviour of chalk when pushed rather\nthan dragged across a blackboard.\n\nReviewing recent theory, a general formulation is proposed, including\na Poisson or energetic impact law. The general problem in 2D with a\nsingle point of contact is discussed and cases or inconsistency or\nindeterminacy enumerated. Strategies to resolve the paradox via\ncontact regularisation are discussed from a dynamical systems point of\nview. By passing to the infinite stiffness limit and allowing impact\nwithout collision, inconsistent and indeterminate cases are shown to\nbe resolvable for all open sets of conditions. However, two\nunavoidable ambiguities that can be reached in finite time are\ndiscussed in detail, so called dynamic jam and reverse chatter. A\npartial review is given of 2D cases with two points of contact showing\nhow a greater complexity of inconsistency and indeterminacy can\narise. Extension to fully three-dimensional analysis is briefly\nconsidered and shown to lead to further possible singularities.  In\nconclusion, the ubiquity of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is highlighted and open\nproblems are discussed.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n{\\bf KEYWORDS: \\textit{rigid body}; \\textit{Painlev\\'{e} paradox}; \\textit{Coulomb friction}; \\textit{impact mechanics}; \n\\textit{dynamic jam}; \\textit{sprag-slip oscillation}; \\textit{chatter}; \n\\textit{Zeno phenomenon}; \n\\textit{reverse chatter}; \n\\textit{impact without collision}; \\textit{inconsistency};\n\\textit{indeterminacy}; \\textit{rational mechanics}.}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nPaul Painlev\\'{e} is a truly remarkable figure in the history of\nscience and technology. In mathematics, Painlev\\'{e} is most closely\nassociated with the family of integrable differential equations and\ncorresponding transcendental functions that bear his name.  But there\nis much more to Painlev\\'{e}, \\cite{Borisov}; he made pivotal\ncontributions to the theory of gravitation, he was possibly the\nfirst ever aircraft passenger (taking a seat in the Wright brother's plane in\n1908) and set up the world's first degree in programme in Aerospace\nEngineering. His role as Minister of Public Instruction and\nInventions, led to him being appointed Prime Minister of France\nbriefly during the First World War, and again in 1924. In the latter\nstint he was forced to resign after being unable to solve the\noverriding financial crisis of the time (an uncanny parallel to 21st Century\nEuropean politics, perhaps).\n\nThis paper shall look at the legacy of Painlev\\'{e}'s work in\nrigid body mechanics, specifically the rather curious phenomena\nthat are present in models of dry friction.  In a series\nof papers starting in 1895\n\\cite{Painleve1895,Painleve1905a,Painleve1905b}, {Painlev\\'{e} } provided\nsimple examples which illustrate a fundamental inconsistency in the\nlaws of Coulomb friction. (Technically, we should refer to\nAmontons-Coulomb friction, because the laws were first postulated by\nAmontons at the beginning of the 18th Century, whereas Coulomb's role\nwas one of experimental verification, see\ne.g.~\\cite{Martyn1742,Feeny1998}. As with many unjust attributions in \nscience, Amontons' name seems to have been dropped from the epithet now used \nto describe the simplest law of dry friction. In fact, theory that \nadditionally involves solving for\nthe normal force at contact is sometimes called the Signorini-Coulomb model \nor the Signorini-Amontons-Coulomb $\\ldots$, but we shall just refer to \nCoulomb friction in what follows.) \nThe so-called Painlev\\'{e} paradox (which, to add more historical accuracy,\nas Painlev\\'{e} acknowledges, was first discovered by Jellet \\cite{Jellet1872})\noccurs in planar bodies undergoing oblique contact for which\nthere is a sufficiently large coupling between normal and tangential\ndegrees of freedom at the contact point. Such configurations, given\nsufficiently high coefficient of friction, can reach a point where\nthere is no longer a unique forward simulation --- either a multiplicity of\npossibilities (\\textit{indeterminacy}), or none (\\textit{inconsistency}) --- so there\nis no way to decide what happens next within rigid body mechanics. \nFurther historical remarks on the origins of the Painlev\\'{e} paradox\ncan be found in the books by Brogliato \\cite{Brogliato1999} and\nand Le Suan Anh \\cite{LeSuanAn_book}.\n\nThe configuration most closely associated with Painlev\\'{e} is that of\nrod falling under gravity whose lowest end is in contact with a\nhorizontal surface and subject to simple Coulomb friction, see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:CPP}.  We shall refer to this as the classical {Painlev\\'{e} }\nproblem (CPP), although, as pointed out by Leine \\cite{Leine2002}, this was\nnot actually the example that Painlev\\'{e} considered first (see\nSec.~\\ref{sec:2}).\n\nThe CPP can be realised using a pencil that is momentarily balanced on\nits tip on a rough piece of paper attached to a rigid horizontal\ntable.  Upon letting go, minor disturbances mean the pencil will have\na shallow angle to the vertical and will start to fall.  Initially,\nthe tip remains fixed, forming a pivot about which the pencil\nrotates. Upon reaching some critical angle, the tangential force at the\ntip will be large enough for the pencil to begin to slip (in the\nopposite direction to the instantaneous horizontal velocity component\nof the top). A faint line begins to appear on the\npaper. As the pencil continues to fall, \nbefore it becomes fully horizontal, the angular acceleration will be\nsufficient to overcome the vertical component of the ground reaction\nforce at the tip.  Thus, the tip lifts off and the faint line is\nterminated. A fraction of a second later, the blunt end of the\npencil hits the table, some rattling motion ensues, before the pencil\nbecomes fully horizontal, rolls for a while and comes to rest on the\ntable. No paradox.\n\nWhat {Painlev\\'{e} } realised though is that if the coefficient of friction is\nlarge enough (in fact, unrealistically large for an approximately\nuniform rod like a pencil on anything other than the coarsest\nsandpaper) then something else can happen. Before the pencil lifts\noff, it can reach a configuration that is now known as \\textit{dynamic\n  jam} where one cannot decide with certainty what happens next.  The\npencil tip could lift off in the usual way with an\ninitially infinitesimal normal velocity.  Or, the pencil could remain in contact\nsuch that the more\nit tries to lift off, the more it rotates and digs back down into the surface. \nIt is as if there is a negative normal force pulling the tip\ninto the surface. If one adds a rigid impact model,\nlike Newton's law of restitution, \nto the mechanical\nformulation, \nthen such a\nforce causes a so-called \\textit{impact without collision} (IWC)\n\\cite[Ch.~5.5]{Brogliato1999}, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:3.2} below. Such\nan impact involves an impulsive jump to reduce the tip's slipping\nvelocity to zero and eject it from the surface with\na finite normal velocity. We give a more quantitative\ndescription of the paradox for the CPP in Sec.~\\ref{sec:2.2} below.\n\nOne of the purposes of this paper is to show that the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is\n\\textit{not} just a theoretical curiosity manifest only in ``toy''\nmathematical models of pencils on unrealistically rough surfaces.  The\nconsequences of the Painlev\\'{e} paradox are in fact ubiquitous, even\nin everyday phenomena. For example, robotic manipulators, pieces of\nchalk or even your finger are known to \\textit{judder} when they are being\npushed across a rough surface \\cite{Liu2007}, see\nSec.~\\ref{sec:2.3} for more details.  The phenomenon in question,\nsometimes referred to \\textit{sprag-slip oscillation} \\cite{Hoffmann}, is\nmore complex than mere stick-slip behaviour, as it additionally\ninvolves lift-off and impact every cycle.  In fact, the somewhat\ncontroversial American physicist Walter Lewin is well known for\ndemonstrating how to exploit this effect to draw \ndotted lines on a blackboard reliably and rapidly\nby inducing sprag-slip oscillations \nin the chalk. See Fig.~\\ref{fig:hall}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{hall.pdf}\n\\label{fig:hall}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{After \\cite{Hall}, previously unpublished, reproduced by permission.\nThree traces left by chalk moved by hand \nacross a rigid blackboard. In all figures the\ndirection of motion is downwards. In (a) there is an acute angle between\nthe chalk's axis and the velocity vector, whereas in (b) and (c) the angle\nis obtuse. The difference between (b) and (c) is that an increased\nnormal force is applied in (c).} \n\\end{figure}\n\nNordmark \\textit{et al} \\cite{paper2} demonstrated that such\nsprag-slip oscillations can arise as a consequence of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox through\nan instability that they termed \\textit{reverse chatter} (see Sec. \\ref{sec:3}\nbelow). This instability involves a sequence of impacts that\naccumulate backwards in time; rather like watching a video in reverse \nof a bouncing ball coming to rest.  Another everyday phenomenon\nthat can be considered to be a consequence of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is how\na rigid body can seem to defy gravity by being ``wedged'' into an\noverhang (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:ambiguity} below).\nAs we shall show in Sec.~\\ref{sec:6}, there can be subtle\neffects that involve the interplay between the two contact points,\neach of which can independently exhibit the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox.\n\nThe main aim of this paper is to provide an overview of recent\nacademic work relating to the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox in order to provide some\nclarity, while keeping in mind the practical implications of the\ntheory.  In so doing, we shall also include preliminary new results by\nthe authors and their collaborators, the details of which shall appear\nelsewhere.  Overall, we shall attempt to provide answers to the\nfollowing two central questions:\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[Question 1.] For a given rigid body system \nwith contact, in a given state at a\n  given instance of time, is there a uniquely defined forward-time\n  continuation of the dynamics within the formalism of rigid body\n  mechanics?  This divides naturally into two subquestions: is \\textit{any}\n  possible forward continuation possible (consistency), \nand, if so, is it unique (determinacy)?  \n\n\\item[Question 2.] Given a rigid body system \nthat is not exhibiting the {Painlev\\'{e} }\n  paradox at one instance of time, what possible ways can it enter\n  into a {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox state at a later in time? Again there are two\n  subquestions: how unlikely is it to enter an inconsistent or\n  indeterminate state; and what happens next?\n\\end{description}\n\nAs we shall show, no complete answer to either question is yet\nknown. Nevertheless, we shall attempt to provide partial answers,\nrestricted to the case of a single point contact in two spatial\ndimensions. As we shall see though, there are way more possibilities\nthat need consideration in 3D or in the presence of several isolated\npoint contacts, for which we can only provide partial results. For\nmore physically realistic problems with regional (line or patch)\ncontacts, almost nothing is known. Therefore in this paper we shall\nrestrict attention to problems with a finite number of \\textit{isolated\n  point contacts}.\n\nAnother aim of this paper is steer a path through the various\napproaches that have been proposed to \\textit{resolve} the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox\nfrom both a practical and a rational, analytic point of view.  \nOur focus is not particularly on numerical methods for simulation in the presence\nof the paradox, although it is worth pointing out recent results for\nexample in \\cite{Acary,Schindler,Trinkle}. Nor do we consider \ncontrol algorithms designed to avoid {Painlev\\'{e} } paradoxes in robotic systems, but\nsee e.g.~\\cite{Brogliato1999,Elkar:11} for recent results. \nInstead, we shall \nattempt to understand the dynamical consequences of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox\nfrom a mathematical modelling point of view, \nbuilding on recent\nunderstanding of the theory of piecewise-smooth\ndynamical systems\nsee \\cite{Filippov,Leine_book,SIAM_review,Springerbook},\nIn fact, it is well known that piecewise-smooth systems of\nFilippov-type \\cite{Filippov} can exhibit nonuniqueness or nonexistence of solutions, see e.g.~\\cite{Filippov,Bastien,Jeffrey}.  \n\nPhilosophically speaking, the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is not a puzzle about\nthe real world, but a failure of a theory based on \nrigid body mechanics and Coulomb friction to provide complete unequivocal\ndescriptions of dynamics. \nIn truth, any physical resolution of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox tends to involve \nrelaxing some of\nthe assumptions of rigid body mechanics in order to predict what\nhappens next, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}. \nIn effect, the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox provides insight into\npoints of extreme sensitivity in rigid body mechanics where additional\nphysics, possibly at the microscale, is required in order to\naccurately capture the dynamics.  \nSuch points of extreme sensitivity\nare typically going to be observable as points where significant changes\ncan result from minuscule variations of the physical properties or \ninitial states of the bodies involved. A key question to be addressed then is:\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[Question 3.]  Given a rigid body system with contact whose forward\n  evolution is either inconsistent or indeterminate, what is the\n  minimal extra modelling ingredient in order for there to be a unique\n  forward evolution in all inconsistent and indeterminate cases?\n  Which cases can be made \\textit{uniformly resolvable} via this\n  approach; by which we mean, if the additional ingredient to the\n  theory arises through a small parameter $\\varepsilon$, does a\n  qualitatively consistent outcome occur uniformly in the limit as\n  $\\varepsilon \\to 0$?\n\\end{description}\n\nThe rest of this paper is outlined as follows. Section \\ref{sec:2}\ncontains a historical introduction to the subject. A mathematical\nexplanation of the paradox is given in terms of the CPP. This is\nfollowed by a discussion of the role of different friction laws, a\ndescription of other simple configurations that feature\nthe {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox and a brief review of the various attempts\nto resolve the paradox.  Section \\ref{sec:3} then introduces a general\nformulation for the simplified case of a planar system with a\nsingle contact. An attempt is made \nto answer Question 1 by enumerating all the different cases that lead\nto inconsistency or indeterminacy.  We also discuss how to augment the\nformulation by including an impact law, and discuss the possibility of\nthe accumulation of impacts via \\textit{chatter}\n(also known as the Zeno phenomenon).  Section \\ref{sec:4} then \nlooks at Question 3 by adding compliance\ninto the model in order to find cases that are uniformly resolvable.\nSection \\ref{sec:5} considers Question 2 for the 2D single contact\ncase; the theory of G\\'{e}not and Brogliato \\cite{Genot1999} is\nreviewed and generalised, to show cases where dynamic jam must\noccur. We also consider whether the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox can be \napproached through chatter and consider conditions under which \nreverse chatter can be triggered. \nSection \\ref{sec:6} considers extensions to the theory for configurations with\ntwo or more contact points and starts to\nenumerate the additional paradoxes that can occur.\nSection \\ref{sec:7} then briefly considers the single-contact problem in 3D, \nillustrating that a different kind of dynamic jam can occur which does\nnot involve the singularity analysed in \\cite{Genot1999}.\nFinally, Section \\ref{sec:8} draws conclusions, highlights \nopen problems and and makes philosophical remarks.\n\n\\section{Historical perspective}\n\\label{sec:2}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth]{CPP.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The classical {Painlev\\'{e} } problem (CPP) for a falling rod.}\n\\label{fig:CPP}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{The classical {Painlev\\'{e} } problem}\n\nThe CPP, first proposed by {Painlev\\'{e} } in 1905\n\\cite{Painleve1905b}, involves a slender rigid rod falling under\ngravity while in contact with a rigid, stationary, frictional\nhorizontal surface.

What happens after the G-spot is reached is not clear. \n\n\\subsection{Is the paradox due to unrealistic friction models?}\n\\label{sec:2.2} \n\nOne simple possible resolution of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is that a\ncoefficient of friction $\\mu=4/3$ is unrealistically large, with\ntypical values for most materials being significantly less than 1\n(although values as large as 2 have been proposed for rubber-on-rubber\ncontacts).  This resolution is specious though because it is easy to\nformulate mechanisms for which ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ is significantly smaller. For\nexample, if we allow the rod in the CPP to be non-uniform, then\n${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ is a function of the radius of gyration $r$. Taking the limit\nthat all the mass is concentrated at the centre of mass, then $r \\to\n0$ and the formula {(\\ref{{eq:mumin}})} shows that ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ becomes\nvanishingly small in this limit.\n\nAnother possible resolution is that the Coulomb\nfriction law is too simplistic and that if a ``more realistic''\nfriction model is used, the\n{Painlev\\'{e} } effect will disappear.  This may be possible for certain cases\nand configurations, but seems unlikely in general.  For example, Liu\n\\textit{et al} \\cite{Liu2007} find the paradox to still be present in a\nmodel that has a different dynamic and static coefficient of friction. \nIn addition, there is a trivial indeterminacy if, as is typical for\nsuch models, the static \ncoefficient of friction is higher than the dynamic one. \n\nGrigoryan \\cite{Grigoryan01} proposes that the CPP can be resolved by\nreplacing the Coulomb friction law with a smoothed version in which\n$\\lambda_T$ is a smooth function of $u$ with\nlarge finite slope at $u=0$. Philosophically, this is equivalent\nto replacing dry friction with viscous friction for low velocities.\nHowever, he studies only a single rather artificial\nmodel, the so-called {Painlev\\'{e} }-Klein problem (see Sec.~\\ref{sec:2.3})\nand the resolution doesn't seem to satisfy our definition of\nuniform resolvability in the limit that the slope tends to infinity. \nAlso, Ivanov \\cite{Ivanov03} claims that such friction laws introduce\nfurther non-uniqueness in place of non-existence.   \nIf instead we replace Coulomb law with a Stribeck law \n(see e.g.~\\cite{Rouzic:13}) in\nwhich there is still a jump at $u=0$ but $\\mu$ is taken to be a \nsmooth function of $u$, then the above calculations for the CPP can\nbe easily repeated. It is straightforward to show that  \nin principle, there is no\nimpediment to $p^\\pm$ becoming negative in this case too. \nThe same conclusion holds if $\\mu$ is a\nfunction of position $x$ or some internal state variable such as in\nrate-and-state friction models (see \\cite{Putelat:15} and references\ntherein).\n\nThere is a rich literature on detailed microscopic friction modelling, \nindeed \\textit{tribology}\\/ is\na field in its own right, which we shall not explore further here. Even\nsimple models of tangential friction, ignoring the dynamics in\nnormal directions, can give rise to complex dynamics such as\nstick-slip vibrations and ``squeal''; see for example the reviews\n\\cite{Woodhouse,Kinkaid,Feeny1998}.  Clearly, when dealing with the\n{Painlev\\'{e} } paradox, the details of what happens in practice are going to\ndepend sensitively on the precise friction characteristics.\nNevertheless, it is our contention that the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is\nfundamentally due to the nature of the coupling between normal and\ntangential degrees of freedom, rather than to specific properties\nof the friction law.  Therefore, throughout the rest of this paper, for\nsimplicity, we assume the simple Coulomb law \\eqref{eq:Coulomb}, \nwith a single coefficient of friction $\\mu$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{OPP.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The original problem posed by Painlev\\'{e} of a slipping block\n\\label{fig:OPP}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Other mechanical configurations}\n\\label{sec:2.3}\n\nIn fact, as pointed out by Leine \\textit{et al} \\cite{Leine2002}, the\noriginal problem studied by Painlev\\'{e} in 1895 \\cite{Painleve1895}\nwas not the CPP but that of a planar box slipping down a rough plane\nthat is inclined at a shallow angle to the horizontal; see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:OPP}. The box is assumed to be in point contact at its\nlowest corner and to be subject to Coulomb friction.  As Leine \\textit{et\n  al} show, the simplest model of this problem is actually dynamically\nequivalent to the CPP (although see \\cite{Mamaev} for a more general analysis)\nand the minimum value of friction coefficient required is\nidentical. In particular, just as with the CPP, if we allow the box to\nhave inhomogeneous mass distribution, then ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ can in theory be as\nsmall as we like.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the motion of chalk being pushed\nacross a blackboard is often proposed as a classroom illustration of\nthe {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox.  In particular, if the chalk is dragged (which\nwould correspond to an angle $\\theta$ in the second quadrant if motion\nis to the right in Fig.~\\ref{fig:CPP}), then a uniform straight line\nis generally seen. However, if the angle is in the first quadrant and\na large force is applied, then the chalk can undergo a series of hops\n\\cite{Hall}.  Such \\textit{sprag-slip oscillations} were reproduced by\nHoffmann and Gaul \\cite{Hoffmann} in various models with compliance at\nthe tip.  These oscillations are at least reminiscent of the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nproperty because lift-off appears to occur despite the chalk being\npressed into the board.  Such an explanation is not sufficient however\nbecause the coefficient of friction for chalk on a blackboard is\nlikely to be significantly less than ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}=4/3$.  However, the\ncontact mechanics of chalk, a cylinder that is typically only in\ncontact along part of its end, is likely to be more complex than that\nof an ideal rod, and we also have to take account of the body forces\nand controls being applied by the teacher. Moreover, we shall also see\nin Sec.~\\ref{sec:5} that another explanation for the onset of the\nhopping motion, namely reverse chatter, can be triggered upon the\ntransition from stick to slip, even if $p^\\pm$ remain positive. Indeed\nNordmark \\textit{et al} \\cite{paper2} show that an open-loop controller\nimplementing a vander-Pol-like body force to a simple rod model can\ntrigger reverse chatter that saturates into limit-cycle motion.\n\nA laboratory demonstration of sprag-slip oscillations can be made\nthrough a pin-on-disk rig, if the the pin is allowed to contact\nobliquely and to lift off \\cite{Ibrahim1994}. Such experimental\napparatus is often used to categorise friction-induced `brake squeal'\nvibrations, see for example \\cite{Butlin2013}.  Inspired by such\nsystems, Leine \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{Leine2002} studied a so-called\nfrictional impact oscillator, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:leine}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{frict_osc1.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The frictional impact oscillator and its simplification, as studied \nin \\cite{Leine2002}}\n\\label{fig:leine}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThey showed that under suitable choices of parameters the condition\nfor the {Painlev\\'{e} } property to hold can be written as ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}} = 2\n\\sqrt{m_1/m_2}$, which of course can take arbitrarily small values if\nthe second mass is much heavier than the first. They found that\nfinite-amplitude stable periodic motion can occur in the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparameter region that comprises phases of free motion, sticking and\nslipping. The onset of this motion typically occurs via a subcritical\nHopf bifurcation from the steady sticking solution.\n\nA related practical manifestation of sprag-slip oscillation is\nthe hopping motion that is sometimes observed in\nfinger-like robotic manipulators \\cite{Brogliato1999}. Inspired by\nthis, in a series of papers culminating in \\cite{Zhao2008}, Liu, Zhao,\nChen and their co-workers have studied theoretically, numerically and\nexperimentally the motion of the two-link robotic manipulator depicted\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:liu_or}(a). In particular, in \\cite{Liu2007} they\nfound precise formula for ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$, which tends to zero as the height\n$H \\to 0$.  They were also able to simulate bouncing motion\ncorresponding to a concatenation of stick, slip, free flight and\nimpact. That such hopping motion is attributable to the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox\nis now well established in the robotics literature, and work instead\nhas begun to look at how to control such unwanted behaviour\n(e.g. \\cite{Elkar:11,Liang}).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{liu.pdf}\n\\caption{(a) The two-link robotic manipulator \\cite{Liu2007}. (b)\nThe inverted pendulum on slider \\cite{Or2012}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\label{fig:liu_or}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThere are also possible applications of these ideas in bio-mimicry of\nsensing systems. For example, mammals such as rats, have slender\ntapered rod-like whiskers that repeatedly sweep and tap on a surface\nat oblique angles, see e.g.~\\cite{Sullivan2009}. The motion of the tip\nof a rat's whisker seems akin to sprag-slip oscillation, but driven\nby a regular circular motion from the follicle. It would appear that\nthe combined effects of stick-slip and lift-off from the tip, fed back\nalong the whisker enable the rat to sense both texture and compliance\nof the surface.\n\nAnother experimentally amenable {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox demonstrator was \nproposed by Or \\&\nRimon \\cite{Or2012}, the so-called\ninverted pendulum on a slider, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:liu_or}(b).\nThey were able to find explicit expressions for\ninitial conditions and parameters \nthat would lead to dynamic jam in such a device. \nThey found the explicit expression  ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}} =\n\\sqrt{(2(1+m_1/m_2)(1+\\rho_2/r_2)-1)^2 -1}$, which can be chosen to be\nexperimentally accessible by choosing appropriate values for the\nconfiguration constants $m_1$, $m_2$ $r_2$ and $\\rho_2$.\n\nA less explored, but potentially industrially important area in which the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox can\napply is in rotating machinery. Here there may be large coupling between normal and tangential\ndegrees of freedom due to gyroscopic forces.  \nFor example Wilms \\& Cohen\n\\cite{Wilms1997} report that the {Painlev\\'{e} } effect can be seen the motion\nof rotating shaft whose bearing is subject to coulomb friction.\nKozlov \\cite{Kozlov} studies a brake shoe problem that exhibits the\n{Painlev\\'{e} } paradox, which he claims was resolved by Neimark and co-workers\n\\cite{Neimark} by introducing longitudinal\nand transverse elasticity, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:2.4}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth]{klein.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The Painlev\\'{e}-Klein problem}\n\\label{fig:Klein}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAll of the above examples correspond to cases with a single point\ncontact. There is less in the literature on the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox occurring\nin problems with multiple contacts.  The Russian literature tends to\nuse as the canonical model, not the CPP but the so-called\nPainlev\\'{e}-Klein problem, see \\cite{Ivanov03,Neimark,Wagener,Grigoryan01,LeSuan90}. \nA good summary discussion of work on this problem is given in the book by Anh\n\\cite{LeSuanAn_book}. \nThe problem involves a rod that is wedged between two rigid constraints with\nCoulomb friction applying at each, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:Klein}. In fact,\nlike the slipping block in Fig.~\\ref{fig:OPP}, this problem predates\nthe CPP, going back to Painlev\\'{e}'s original work\n\\cite{Painleve1895}.  Here it can be shown that there are multiple\ncases to analyse depending on whether lift-off is allowed to occur at\n either of the contacts. The simplest case is where both ends are assumed to\nalways remain in contact, so that the normal forces $\\Lambda_{N_{1,2}}$ can take\neither sign. Such frictional contacts are termed \\textit{bilateral}.\nThen, using the notation in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Klein}, paradoxes can be shown to \noccur whenever\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 22836, "prevtext": "\nthat makes the normal acceleration in \\eqref{eq:CPP_bp} \nvanish, so that the rod remains in contact while it falls. \n\nSimilarly if $\\theta$ is initially \nsmall and positive so that the rod is close to horizontal\nthen $b<0$ and $p^+>0$. However, for intermediate angles, depending on\nother parameters and velocities, $p^+$ and $b$ may in general\ntake either sign. So let us analyse what happens at a time when\neither $p$ or $b$ smoothly changes sign during motion.\n\nA point where $b$ passes from negative to positive (while $p^+$ remains positive) \nis easy to analyse. This would represent a point at which the rod \nsimply lifts off from the surface. The normal force \n\\eqref{eq:slip_normal_force} smoothly tends to zero, \nthe dynamics would lift off into free motion with $y(t)>0$ and $\\lambda_N=0$.  \n\nThe case of negative $p^+$ is much more unusual.  \nFirst, consider the possibility of\n$p^+<0$ and $b<0$.

These attempts took on new vigour in the 1990s due to the\ndevelopment of rigorous methods using the complementarity framework\nfor rigid body mechanics and the theory of differential inclusions; see\nfor example \\cite{Stewart2000} for a review. One idea, due \nto the  influential French\nmathematician Moreau \\cite{Moreau1988}, is to solve the problem via\nsimulation, using specific time-stepping numerical\ndiscretisation schemes designed for linear complementarity problems.\nUsing this idea Stewart \\cite{Stewart1997,Stewart1998} provided a resolution\nin the form of a rigorous proof that a time-stepping schemes exist that are\nwell posed and, by taking the zero-stepsize limit, one has a proof\nthat mechanics in the {Painlev\\'{e} } regime is \\textit{consistent}. That is, there\nis always a well defined forward-time evolution of the dynamics from\nany reachable configuration.  However, this approach does not deal\nwith the problem of \\textit{indeterminacy} that is, one can have\nnon-uniqueness in the forward time dynamics. \nStewart's result also does not resolve the paradox in the sense of the three \nQuestions posed in the introduction\nas it does not consider the nature of the solution in the \nlimit as the stepsize tends to zero. \n\nAnother way to resolve the Painlev\\'{e} paradox is to break the\nformalism of rigid body mechanics and to introduce some new physics,\nfor example by including dynamics in the normal direction, thus\nsmoothing the problem. This approach seems to be prominent in the\nSoviet literature, following the publication of the Russian\ntranslation of Painlev\\'{e}'s work in 1954 (see\ne.g.~\\cite{LeSuan90,Ivanov03,Neimark,LeSuanAn_book} and references\ntherein).  For example, Neimark and Smirnova \\cite{Neimark} propose\nthat the normal force should be considered as a dynamical variable\nthat evolves on a fast timescale. They argue that the dynamics of the\nPainlev\\'{e}-Klein problem would then feature ``contrast structures''\nby which they mean two-timescale dynamics that can converge to\nperiodic solutions with well-defined rapid jumps in tangential\nvelocity. Without this regularisation they claim that only constant\nacceleration solutions can be found in the Painlev\\'{e}-Klein problem.\nThis general approach can be referred to as \\textit{contact\n  regularisation}, which treats the rigid body limit of a compliant\nformulation as a singular perturbation problem. A good general\ndiscussion of contact regularisation and its application to the\nPainlev\\'{e}-Klein problem in particular can be found in\n\\cite{LeSuanAn_book}.  In Sec.~\\ref{sec:4} below we show how such\ncontact regularisation in the normal direction \ncan lead to answers to Questions 2 and 3 by\ntaking the limit that the stiffness, following arguments in\n\\cite{paper2}.\n\nMost authors agree that a complete understanding of the Painlev\\'{e}\nparadox requires consideration of impact. That is, what would happen\nin the CPP if the rod is first dropped onto the surface so that it\nfirst makes contact with $v<0$ and $b>0$. In general, contact will not\nbe maintained, but the body will bounce.  Even before the advent of\nclassical mechanics, a great deal of effort was made to understand\ncollisional impact, see \\cite[Appendix A]{Stronge2000} for an\nhistorical account.  Within a rigid-body framework, the loss of energy\nin the impact event is usually modelled as a zero-time process\ninvolving impulsive forces.  Impacts for which there is no coupling\nbetween tangential and normal degrees of freedom during contact are\nmost simply captured by a Newtonian restitution law \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 36459, "prevtext": "\nNow, in the case of a uniform rod for which $r^2=\\frac{1}{3} \\ell^2$, we see\nthat $\\mu_p$ is minimised when $\\theta=\\arctan 2$, \nin which case we can find the\nminimum coefficient of friction for which there exists a value for \n$\\theta$ for which $p^+<0$, namely ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}} =4/3$. Thus, for \n$\\mu>{\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ an interval of angles\n$\\theta$ exists such that $p^+$ can be negative. \n\nSo what does happen for the falling rod if $\\mu>{\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$? \nThis question was analysed in detail\nby G\\'{e}not and Brogliato \\cite{Genot1999} \n(see also \\cite{Zhao15} for a modern re-interpretation). \nThey show that there is a \n$\\mu_c = 8/(3\\sqrt{3}) > 4/3 = {\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$, \nfor the case of the uniform rod, \nsuch that for $\\mu<\\mu_c$\nthere can be no initial condition that\napproaches $p^+=0$ during slipping, the rod must lift off first. \nBut for $\\mu>\\mu_c$ then there is a thin wedge of initial\nconditions $(\\theta,\\dot{\\theta})$ for which a paradox can be reached. \nHowever they show that there can be no entry during forward slipping \ninto regions  with $p^+<0$, the only way to get there is via reaching \na configuration where simultaneously $b=p^+=0$,\nwhich is\nprecisely what Or \\& Rimon \\cite{Or2012} define as \ndynamic jam. As we shall see in Sec.~\\ref{sec:5}, the method of\nG\\'{e}not and Brogliato, involves rescaling time so that\nthe point $b=p=0$ becomes an equilibrium point in a pseudo phase plain,\nwhich can attract an open set of initial conditions. \nIn deference to G\\'{e}not, we shall call this special point the\nG-spot. What happens after the G-spot is reached is not clear. \n\n\\subsection{Is the paradox due to unrealistic friction models?}\n\\label{sec:2.2} \n\nOne simple possible resolution of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is that a\ncoefficient of friction $\\mu=4/3$ is unrealistically large, with\ntypical values for most materials being significantly less than 1\n(although values as large as 2 have been proposed for rubber-on-rubber\ncontacts).  This resolution is specious though because it is easy to\nformulate mechanisms for which ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ is significantly smaller. For\nexample, if we allow the rod in the CPP to be non-uniform, then\n${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ is a function of the radius of gyration $r$. Taking the limit\nthat all the mass is concentrated at the centre of mass, then $r \\to\n0$ and the formula {(\\ref{{eq:mumin}})} shows that ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ becomes\nvanishingly small in this limit.\n\nAnother possible resolution is that the Coulomb\nfriction law is too simplistic and that if a ``more realistic''\nfriction model is used, the\n{Painlev\\'{e} } effect will disappear.  This may be possible for certain cases\nand configurations, but seems unlikely in general.  For example, Liu\n\\textit{et al} \\cite{Liu2007} find the paradox to still be present in a\nmodel that has a different dynamic and static coefficient of friction. \nIn addition, there is a trivial indeterminacy if, as is typical for\nsuch models, the static \ncoefficient of friction is higher than the dynamic one. \n\nGrigoryan \\cite{Grigoryan01} proposes that the CPP can be resolved by\nreplacing the Coulomb friction law with a smoothed version in which\n$\\lambda_T$ is a smooth function of $u$ with\nlarge finite slope at $u=0$. Philosophically, this is equivalent\nto replacing dry friction with viscous friction for low velocities.\nHowever, he studies only a single rather artificial\nmodel, the so-called {Painlev\\'{e} }-Klein problem (see Sec.~\\ref{sec:2.3})\nand the resolution doesn't seem to satisfy our definition of\nuniform resolvability in the limit that the slope tends to infinity. \nAlso, Ivanov \\cite{Ivanov03} claims that such friction laws introduce\nfurther non-uniqueness in place of non-existence.   \nIf instead we replace Coulomb law with a Stribeck law \n(see e.g.~\\cite{Rouzic:13}) in\nwhich there is still a jump at $u=0$ but $\\mu$ is taken to be a \nsmooth function of $u$, then the above calculations for the CPP can\nbe easily repeated. It is straightforward to show that  \nin principle, there is no\nimpediment to $p^\\pm$ becoming negative in this case too. \nThe same conclusion holds if $\\mu$ is a\nfunction of position $x$ or some internal state variable such as in\nrate-and-state friction models (see \\cite{Putelat:15} and references\ntherein).\n\nThere is a rich literature on detailed microscopic friction modelling, \nindeed \\textit{tribology}\\/ is\na field in its own right, which we shall not explore further here. Even\nsimple models of tangential friction, ignoring the dynamics in\nnormal directions, can give rise to complex dynamics such as\nstick-slip vibrations and ``squeal''; see for example the reviews\n\\cite{Woodhouse,Kinkaid,Feeny1998}.  Clearly, when dealing with the\n{Painlev\\'{e} } paradox, the details of what happens in practice are going to\ndepend sensitively on the precise friction characteristics.\nNevertheless, it is our contention that the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is\nfundamentally due to the nature of the coupling between normal and\ntangential degrees of freedom, rather than to specific properties\nof the friction law.  Therefore, throughout the rest of this paper, for\nsimplicity, we assume the simple Coulomb law \\eqref{eq:Coulomb}, \nwith a single coefficient of friction $\\mu$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{OPP.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The original problem posed by Painlev\\'{e} of a slipping block\n\\label{fig:OPP}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Other mechanical configurations}\n\\label{sec:2.3}\n\nIn fact, as pointed out by Leine \\textit{et al} \\cite{Leine2002}, the\noriginal problem studied by Painlev\\'{e} in 1895 \\cite{Painleve1895}\nwas not the CPP but that of a planar box slipping down a rough plane\nthat is inclined at a shallow angle to the horizontal; see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:OPP}. The box is assumed to be in point contact at its\nlowest corner and to be subject to Coulomb friction.  As Leine \\textit{et\n  al} show, the simplest model of this problem is actually dynamically\nequivalent to the CPP (although see \\cite{Mamaev} for a more general analysis)\nand the minimum value of friction coefficient required is\nidentical. In particular, just as with the CPP, if we allow the box to\nhave inhomogeneous mass distribution, then ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$ can in theory be as\nsmall as we like.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the motion of chalk being pushed\nacross a blackboard is often proposed as a classroom illustration of\nthe {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox.  In particular, if the chalk is dragged (which\nwould correspond to an angle $\\theta$ in the second quadrant if motion\nis to the right in Fig.~\\ref{fig:CPP}), then a uniform straight line\nis generally seen. However, if the angle is in the first quadrant and\na large force is applied, then the chalk can undergo a series of hops\n\\cite{Hall}.  Such \\textit{sprag-slip oscillations} were reproduced by\nHoffmann and Gaul \\cite{Hoffmann} in various models with compliance at\nthe tip.  These oscillations are at least reminiscent of the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nproperty because lift-off appears to occur despite the chalk being\npressed into the board.  Such an explanation is not sufficient however\nbecause the coefficient of friction for chalk on a blackboard is\nlikely to be significantly less than ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}=4/3$.  However, the\ncontact mechanics of chalk, a cylinder that is typically only in\ncontact along part of its end, is likely to be more complex than that\nof an ideal rod, and we also have to take account of the body forces\nand controls being applied by the teacher. Moreover, we shall also see\nin Sec.~\\ref{sec:5} that another explanation for the onset of the\nhopping motion, namely reverse chatter, can be triggered upon the\ntransition from stick to slip, even if $p^\\pm$ remain positive. Indeed\nNordmark \\textit{et al} \\cite{paper2} show that an open-loop controller\nimplementing a vander-Pol-like body force to a simple rod model can\ntrigger reverse chatter that saturates into limit-cycle motion.\n\nA laboratory demonstration of sprag-slip oscillations can be made\nthrough a pin-on-disk rig, if the the pin is allowed to contact\nobliquely and to lift off \\cite{Ibrahim1994}. Such experimental\napparatus is often used to categorise friction-induced `brake squeal'\nvibrations, see for example \\cite{Butlin2013}.  Inspired by such\nsystems, Leine \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{Leine2002} studied a so-called\nfrictional impact oscillator, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:leine}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{frict_osc1.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The frictional impact oscillator and its simplification, as studied \nin \\cite{Leine2002}}\n\\label{fig:leine}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThey showed that under suitable choices of parameters the condition\nfor the {Painlev\\'{e} } property to hold can be written as ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}} = 2\n\\sqrt{m_1/m_2}$, which of course can take arbitrarily small values if\nthe second mass is much heavier than the first. They found that\nfinite-amplitude stable periodic motion can occur in the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparameter region that comprises phases of free motion, sticking and\nslipping. The onset of this motion typically occurs via a subcritical\nHopf bifurcation from the steady sticking solution.\n\nA related practical manifestation of sprag-slip oscillation is\nthe hopping motion that is sometimes observed in\nfinger-like robotic manipulators \\cite{Brogliato1999}. Inspired by\nthis, in a series of papers culminating in \\cite{Zhao2008}, Liu, Zhao,\nChen and their co-workers have studied theoretically, numerically and\nexperimentally the motion of the two-link robotic manipulator depicted\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:liu_or}(a). In particular, in \\cite{Liu2007} they\nfound precise formula for ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}}$, which tends to zero as the height\n$H \\to 0$.  They were also able to simulate bouncing motion\ncorresponding to a concatenation of stick, slip, free flight and\nimpact. That such hopping motion is attributable to the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox\nis now well established in the robotics literature, and work instead\nhas begun to look at how to control such unwanted behaviour\n(e.g. \\cite{Elkar:11,Liang}).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{liu.pdf}\n\\caption{(a) The two-link robotic manipulator \\cite{Liu2007}. (b)\nThe inverted pendulum on slider \\cite{Or2012}.}\n\\end{center}\n\\label{fig:liu_or}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThere are also possible applications of these ideas in bio-mimicry of\nsensing systems. For example, mammals such as rats, have slender\ntapered rod-like whiskers that repeatedly sweep and tap on a surface\nat oblique angles, see e.g.~\\cite{Sullivan2009}. The motion of the tip\nof a rat's whisker seems akin to sprag-slip oscillation, but driven\nby a regular circular motion from the follicle. It would appear that\nthe combined effects of stick-slip and lift-off from the tip, fed back\nalong the whisker enable the rat to sense both texture and compliance\nof the surface.\n\nAnother experimentally amenable {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox demonstrator was \nproposed by Or \\&\nRimon \\cite{Or2012}, the so-called\ninverted pendulum on a slider, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:liu_or}(b).\nThey were able to find explicit expressions for\ninitial conditions and parameters \nthat would lead to dynamic jam in such a device. \nThey found the explicit expression  ${\\mu_{P,\\rm{min}}} =\n\\sqrt{(2(1+m_1/m_2)(1+\\rho_2/r_2)-1)^2 -1}$, which can be chosen to be\nexperimentally accessible by choosing appropriate values for the\nconfiguration constants $m_1$, $m_2$ $r_2$ and $\\rho_2$.\n\nA less explored, but potentially industrially important area in which the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox can\napply is in rotating machinery. Here there may be large coupling between normal and tangential\ndegrees of freedom due to gyroscopic forces.  \nFor example Wilms \\& Cohen\n\\cite{Wilms1997} report that the {Painlev\\'{e} } effect can be seen the motion\nof rotating shaft whose bearing is subject to coulomb friction.\nKozlov \\cite{Kozlov} studies a brake shoe problem that exhibits the\n{Painlev\\'{e} } paradox, which he claims was resolved by Neimark and co-workers\n\\cite{Neimark} by introducing longitudinal\nand transverse elasticity, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:2.4}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth]{klein.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The Painlev\\'{e}-Klein problem}\n\\label{fig:Klein}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAll of the above examples correspond to cases with a single point\ncontact. There is less in the literature on the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox occurring\nin problems with multiple contacts.  The Russian literature tends to\nuse as the canonical model, not the CPP but the so-called\nPainlev\\'{e}-Klein problem, see \\cite{Ivanov03,Neimark,Wagener,Grigoryan01,LeSuan90}. \nA good summary discussion of work on this problem is given in the book by Anh\n\\cite{LeSuanAn_book}. \nThe problem involves a rod that is wedged between two rigid constraints with\nCoulomb friction applying at each, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:Klein}. In fact,\nlike the slipping block in Fig.~\\ref{fig:OPP}, this problem predates\nthe CPP, going back to Painlev\\'{e}'s original work\n\\cite{Painleve1895}.  Here it can be shown that there are multiple\ncases to analyse depending on whether lift-off is allowed to occur at\n either of the contacts. The simplest case is where both ends are assumed to\nalways remain in contact, so that the normal forces $\\Lambda_{N_{1,2}}$ can take\neither sign. Such frictional contacts are termed \\textit{bilateral}.\nThen, using the notation in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Klein}, paradoxes can be shown to \noccur whenever\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "$$\n|\\mu_2-\\mu_1| \\leq \\cot \\phi.\n$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"|\\mu_{2}-\\mu_{1}|\\leq\\cot\\phi.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mrow><mi>cot</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03545.tex", "nexttext": "\nA completely elastic (conservative) collision corresponds to \na \\textit{coefficient of restitution} $r=1$, and a completely inelastic\ncase to $r=0$.

Unlike purely normal impacts, it appears \nfrom the literature that \ndifferent modelling choices can be made in order to\nresolve oblique impacts. \nwithin a rigid-body framework.  \nFirst, it is tempting to simply\nignore the tangential dynamics during impact and apply\n{(\\ref{{eq:Newtonian}})} in the normal direction.  However, this can lead to\nan increase in energy during impact\n\\cite{Kane1984,Chatterjee1998}. Another obvious idea is to introduce a\nsecond model parameter, --- a ``transverse coefficient of\nrestitution'' \\cite{Pfeiffer2000} or a fixed ``impulse ratio'' between\nthe tangential and normal velocity jumps \\cite{Brach1991} but this can\nsimilarly be shown to lead to energy gain in Painlev\\'{e} paradox\nsituations \\cite{Burns}. Chatterjee and Ruina \\cite{Chatterjee1998}\ndiscuss which closed form expressions for impact lead to \noblique impacts that are energetically consistent.\n\nAs pointed out in \\cite{Chatterjee1998}, the problem of many\nsimplistic approaches to modelling oblique impact is that they ignore the fact\nthat during the impact process a transition from slip to stick can\noccur. In fact, as argued by Stronge \\cite{Stronge2000}, see also\nSec.~\\ref{sec:3.2} below, consistent impact laws can only be reached\nin all circumstances by solving the dynamic problem of compression\nfollowed by restitution, in a rapid timescale in which the impulsive\nforces become of $O(1)$, fully resolving any transitions between\nslip. This is a form of contact regularisation that makes impact\nresolvable by passing to the limit that its duration is\ninfinitesimal.  The question then arises as to what is the analogue of\nthe coefficient of restitution for such a process.  Or, more\nprecisely, when do we decide that the restitution phase has\nterminated?  Various alternatives are possible, with the simplest one,\nbased on a condition on normal velocities akin to {(\\ref{{eq:Newtonian}})}\nbeing easily shown to be inconsistent, see \\cite{Sanders2013} for a\ncomparison.  One possible resolution is to use Poisson's kinetic\nrestitution law \\cite{Poisson1811}, see also\n\\cite{Keller1986,Batlle1993} that supposes there is a ratio between\nthe normal impulse in compression to that in restitution.\nAlternatively, Stronge \\cite{Stronge1990} proposed an \\textit{energetic}\nrestitution law that considers the ratio of normal work done in\ncompression to that in restitution. Stronge's law has the benefit that\nby construction, it is energetically consistent that is, the impact\nmust be dissipative if the energetic coefficient of restitution is\nstrictly less than unity, and is necessarily conservative if it equals \nunity. Nevertheless, energetic consistency can also be proved to hold for the\nPoisson law \\cite{Ivanov93,Chatterjee1998}.  When the {Painlev\\'{e} } property\nholds, both laws give the possibility of impact without collision (IWC)\n\\cite{Genot1999,Stewart2000}. That is, where a finite outgoing normal\nvelocity ensues from a zero incoming velocity.  As we shall see in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:3.2}, such events can provide a resolution to the\ninconsistent case of the Painlev\\'{e} paradox.\n\nThere are relatively few studies that analyse or simulate \nconfigurations exhibiting the {Painlev\\'{e} } property with models that incorporate\nboth continuous contact and impact.  \nFor example, in one of the first papers to analyse the {Painlev\\'{e} } phenomenon from\nthe perspective of non-smooth bifurcations, Leine \n\\textit{et al.}~\\cite{Leine2002} assumed a \ncoefficient of restitution equal to zero. This was improved\nupon by Liu \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Liu2007} who \nsimulated similar hopping motion using a non-zero Poisson coefficient \nof restitution $r_p$, but their analysis of periodic motion is \nrestricted to the case case $r_p=0$.\n\nIn contrast, Stronge and co-workers \\cite{ShenStronge,Stronge13,Stronge15} \nconsider in detail the transitions\nthat occur during impact, but ignoring the case of IWC.\nThey find that there are no paradoxes. Indeed, this should\nnot be surprising, because, \nas shown in \\cite{paper1,Stronge1990,Djerassi2009} \nexplicit expressions for the outgoing velocity \nin terms of the incoming velocity can be obtained for each of the Newtonian,\nPoisson and Stronge restitution laws, for all possible itineraries of slip\nand stick during compression and restitution.   \n\n\\section{General formulation for planar single contact case} \n\\label{sec:3}\n\n\n\n\nThis section is devoted to the answering Question 1 in the restricted\ncase of planar systems with a single point of contact, without introducing\nany additional ingredients to the rigid-body formulation.

These attempts took on new vigour in the 1990s due to the\ndevelopment of rigorous methods using the complementarity framework\nfor rigid body mechanics and the theory of differential inclusions; see\nfor example \\cite{Stewart2000} for a review. One idea, due \nto the  influential French\nmathematician Moreau \\cite{Moreau1988}, is to solve the problem via\nsimulation, using specific time-stepping numerical\ndiscretisation schemes designed for linear complementarity problems.\nUsing this idea Stewart \\cite{Stewart1997,Stewart1998} provided a resolution\nin the form of a rigorous proof that a time-stepping schemes exist that are\nwell posed and, by taking the zero-stepsize limit, one has a proof\nthat mechanics in the {Painlev\\'{e} } regime is \\textit{consistent}. That is, there\nis always a well defined forward-time evolution of the dynamics from\nany reachable configuration.  However, this approach does not deal\nwith the problem of \\textit{indeterminacy} that is, one can have\nnon-uniqueness in the forward time dynamics. \nStewart's result also does not resolve the paradox in the sense of the three \nQuestions posed in the introduction\nas it does not consider the nature of the solution in the \nlimit as the stepsize tends to zero. \n\nAnother way to resolve the Painlev\\'{e} paradox is to break the\nformalism of rigid body mechanics and to introduce some new physics,\nfor example by including dynamics in the normal direction, thus\nsmoothing the problem. This approach seems to be prominent in the\nSoviet literature, following the publication of the Russian\ntranslation of Painlev\\'{e}'s work in 1954 (see\ne.g.~\\cite{LeSuan90,Ivanov03,Neimark,LeSuanAn_book} and references\ntherein).  For example, Neimark and Smirnova \\cite{Neimark} propose\nthat the normal force should be considered as a dynamical variable\nthat evolves on a fast timescale. They argue that the dynamics of the\nPainlev\\'{e}-Klein problem would then feature ``contrast structures''\nby which they mean two-timescale dynamics that can converge to\nperiodic solutions with well-defined rapid jumps in tangential\nvelocity. Without this regularisation they claim that only constant\nacceleration solutions can be found in the Painlev\\'{e}-Klein problem.\nThis general approach can be referred to as \\textit{contact\n  regularisation}, which treats the rigid body limit of a compliant\nformulation as a singular perturbation problem. A good general\ndiscussion of contact regularisation and its application to the\nPainlev\\'{e}-Klein problem in particular can be found in\n\\cite{LeSuanAn_book}.  In Sec.~\\ref{sec:4} below we show how such\ncontact regularisation in the normal direction \ncan lead to answers to Questions 2 and 3 by\ntaking the limit that the stiffness, following arguments in\n\\cite{paper2}.\n\nMost authors agree that a complete understanding of the Painlev\\'{e}\nparadox requires consideration of impact. That is, what would happen\nin the CPP if the rod is first dropped onto the surface so that it\nfirst makes contact with $v<0$ and $b>0$. In general, contact will not\nbe maintained, but the body will bounce.  Even before the advent of\nclassical mechanics, a great deal of effort was made to understand\ncollisional impact, see \\cite[Appendix A]{Stronge2000} for an\nhistorical account.  Within a rigid-body framework, the loss of energy\nin the impact event is usually modelled as a zero-time process\ninvolving impulsive forces.

Unlike purely normal impacts, it appears \nfrom the literature that \ndifferent modelling choices can be made in order to\nresolve oblique impacts. \nwithin a rigid-body framework.  \nFirst, it is tempting to simply\nignore the tangential dynamics during impact and apply\n{(\\ref{{eq:Newtonian}})} in the normal direction.  However, this can lead to\nan increase in energy during impact\n\\cite{Kane1984,Chatterjee1998}. Another obvious idea is to introduce a\nsecond model parameter, --- a ``transverse coefficient of\nrestitution'' \\cite{Pfeiffer2000} or a fixed ``impulse ratio'' between\nthe tangential and normal velocity jumps \\cite{Brach1991} but this can\nsimilarly be shown to lead to energy gain in Painlev\\'{e} paradox\nsituations \\cite{Burns}. Chatterjee and Ruina \\cite{Chatterjee1998}\ndiscuss which closed form expressions for impact lead to \noblique impacts that are energetically consistent.\n\nAs pointed out in \\cite{Chatterjee1998}, the problem of many\nsimplistic approaches to modelling oblique impact is that they ignore the fact\nthat during the impact process a transition from slip to stick can\noccur. In fact, as argued by Stronge \\cite{Stronge2000}, see also\nSec.~\\ref{sec:3.2} below, consistent impact laws can only be reached\nin all circumstances by solving the dynamic problem of compression\nfollowed by restitution, in a rapid timescale in which the impulsive\nforces become of $O(1)$, fully resolving any transitions between\nslip. This is a form of contact regularisation that makes impact\nresolvable by passing to the limit that its duration is\ninfinitesimal.  The question then arises as to what is the analogue of\nthe coefficient of restitution for such a process.  Or, more\nprecisely, when do we decide that the restitution phase has\nterminated?  Various alternatives are possible, with the simplest one,\nbased on a condition on normal velocities akin to {(\\ref{{eq:Newtonian}})}\nbeing easily shown to be inconsistent, see \\cite{Sanders2013} for a\ncomparison.  One possible resolution is to use Poisson's kinetic\nrestitution law \\cite{Poisson1811}, see also\n\\cite{Keller1986,Batlle1993} that supposes there is a ratio between\nthe normal impulse in compression to that in restitution.\nAlternatively, Stronge \\cite{Stronge1990} proposed an \\textit{energetic}\nrestitution law that considers the ratio of normal work done in\ncompression to that in restitution. Stronge's law has the benefit that\nby construction, it is energetically consistent that is, the impact\nmust be dissipative if the energetic coefficient of restitution is\nstrictly less than unity, and is necessarily conservative if it equals \nunity. Nevertheless, energetic consistency can also be proved to hold for the\nPoisson law \\cite{Ivanov93,Chatterjee1998}.  When the {Painlev\\'{e} } property\nholds, both laws give the possibility of impact without collision (IWC)\n\\cite{Genot1999,Stewart2000}. That is, where a finite outgoing normal\nvelocity ensues from a zero incoming velocity.  As we shall see in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:3.2}, such events can provide a resolution to the\ninconsistent case of the Painlev\\'{e} paradox.\n\nThere are relatively few studies that analyse or simulate \nconfigurations exhibiting the {Painlev\\'{e} } property with models that incorporate\nboth continuous contact and impact.  \nFor example, in one of the first papers to analyse the {Painlev\\'{e} } phenomenon from\nthe perspective of non-smooth bifurcations, Leine \n\\textit{et al.}~\\cite{Leine2002} assumed a \ncoefficient of restitution equal to zero. This was improved\nupon by Liu \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Liu2007} who \nsimulated similar hopping motion using a non-zero Poisson coefficient \nof restitution $r_p$, but their analysis of periodic motion is \nrestricted to the case case $r_p=0$.\n\nIn contrast, Stronge and co-workers \\cite{ShenStronge,Stronge13,Stronge15} \nconsider in detail the transitions\nthat occur during impact, but ignoring the case of IWC.\nThey find that there are no paradoxes. Indeed, this should\nnot be surprising, because, \nas shown in \\cite{paper1,Stronge1990,Djerassi2009} \nexplicit expressions for the outgoing velocity \nin terms of the incoming velocity can be obtained for each of the Newtonian,\nPoisson and Stronge restitution laws, for all possible itineraries of slip\nand stick during compression and restitution.   \n\n\\section{General formulation for planar single contact case} \n\\label{sec:3}\n\n\n\n\nThis section is devoted to the answering Question 1 in the restricted\ncase of planar systems with a single point of contact, without introducing\nany additional ingredients to the rigid-body formulation.

Here, stick is not possible since\n$u>0$, nor is lift-off into free motion, because the free acceleration\n$b$ is in the direction towards the constraint surface $y=0$. Negative\nslip is not possible because $u>0$, and finally positive slip is not possible\nbecause $\\lambda_N$ given by \\eqref{eq:slip_normal_force} would be negative.\nTo resolve what must happen in such cases, in practice we need to consider\nthe possibility of an IWC, which will do in the next subsection.\n\nThere are also two different types of\n{\\bf indeterminacy}, comprising four cases in all. The first type is\nindeterminacy between slip and lift-off in cells I(iii) and III(ii),\nwith these two cases being symmetric with respect to each other under\nthe transformation that maps positive slip to negative slip.  So,\nwithout loss of generality, consider positive\nslip; that is $y=v=0$, $b>0$, $p^+>0$, $u>0$. Here, stick is not\npossible because $u>0$ but lift off is possible, as is positive slip,\nwith $\\lambda_N$ given by \\eqref{eq:slip_normal_force} being positive\nbecause it is the ratio of two negative quantities.  The other type of\nindeterminacy is between liftoff, stick and slip, in cells II(ii) and\nII(iii) where $b>0$ and $a$ is such that we lie inside the friction cone\n(that is, inside the multi-shaded region of the  bottom-right panel of \nFig.~\\ref{fig:consistency}). Here lift-off is possible because $b>0$. \nAdditionally though, a positive normal force $\\lambda_N$ can be found such\nthat the conditions for stick are satisfied.

Here, stick is not possible since\n$u>0$, nor is lift-off into free motion, because the free acceleration\n$b$ is in the direction towards the constraint surface $y=0$. Negative\nslip is not possible because $u>0$, and finally positive slip is not possible\nbecause $\\lambda_N$ given by \\eqref{eq:slip_normal_force} would be negative.\nTo resolve what must happen in such cases, in practice we need to consider\nthe possibility of an IWC, which will do in the next subsection.\n\nThere are also two different types of\n{\\bf indeterminacy}, comprising four cases in all. The first type is\nindeterminacy between slip and lift-off in cells I(iii) and III(ii),\nwith these two cases being symmetric with respect to each other under\nthe transformation that maps positive slip to negative slip.  So,\nwithout loss of generality, consider positive\nslip; that is $y=v=0$, $b>0$, $p^+>0$, $u>0$. Here, stick is not\npossible because $u>0$ but lift off is possible, as is positive slip,\nwith $\\lambda_N$ given by \\eqref{eq:slip_normal_force} being positive\nbecause it is the ratio of two negative quantities.  The other type of\nindeterminacy is between liftoff, stick and slip, in cells II(ii) and\nII(iii) where $b>0$ and $a$ is such that we lie inside the friction cone\n(that is, inside the multi-shaded region of the  bottom-right panel of \nFig.~\\ref{fig:consistency}). Here lift-off is possible because $b>0$. \nAdditionally though, a positive normal force $\\lambda_N$ can be found such\nthat the conditions for stick are satisfied. In addition, a larger normal force\n$\\lambda_N$ exists such that slip is possible for the direction corresponding\nto the parameter $p^\\pm$ that is negative.  \nThese cases of indeterminacy cannot be\nresolved in general (in the sense of Question 1 in the introduction),\nbut can be resolved in terms of their stability (in the sense of\nQuestion 2) see Sec.~\\ref{sec:4} below.\n\n\\subsection{Impact}\n\\label{sec:3.2}\n\nAs discussed in Sec.~\\ref{sec:2.4}, the discussion of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox\nin a rigid body framework requires the inclusion of an impact law. \nIndeed,\nif contact regularisation is included in the normal direction, the necessity of\nIWC is easily concluded (see e.g.~\\cite{Neimark}).\nFollowing \\cite{Stronge2000,paper1}\nwe shall introduce a formalism for the impact phase as something\noccurring on an asymptotically faster timescale $\\tau=t/\\varepsilon$ in\nwhich \ncontact forces become asymptotically large $(|\\lambda_T|,\\lambda_N=\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-1}))$ \nsuch that velocities $(u,v)$\n(and more generally $\\dot{q}$) can vary by an $O(1)$ amount, but the\ngeneralised coordinates $q$ remain constant.

In that case, restitution is deemed to end when the \nnormal impulse in $I_N = \\int \\Lambda_N$ gained during restitution is $r$ times\nthe normal impulse gained during compression, which \ndefines a Poisson coefficient of restitution $r=r_p$\n\nNote that the assumption that the \\textit{same} Coulomb friction law\nshould apply during the impact phase as in the $O(1)$-timescale motion\nis a modelling assumption that doesn't necessarily follow. \nFor example, when modelling\nimpact in a so-called superball, it has been suggested that a friction\nlaw is used where the transition between stick and slip occurs not at $u=0$ \nbut for some non-zero $u>0$~\\cite{Cross15}.\nIn truth, \nfrictional forces are temperature, timescale and spacescale dependent, \nsee e.g.~\\cite{Woodhouse}.  The impact process \\eqref{eq:impactmap} \ncan in principle be defined under different friction laws, or \nindeed for a different value of\nthe coefficient of friction $\\mu_I$ than for the $O(1)$-timescale\nmotion. \n\nNote that in general $v^-<0$, but that in parameter regions 5(b) or \n6(c) in the figure, the impact equations also have a solution \nif $v^-=0$. These regions correspond precisely to when either of the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparameters $p^+$ or $p^-$ is negative and the pre-impacting motion is\nin slip of the correct sign ($u>0$ or $u<0$ respectively).  In\nparticular these two parameter regions are precisely where an impact\ncan occur with $v^-=0$, that is an \\textit{impact without collision}.\nNote these cases map\nto the inconsistent and the indeterminate cases of \nTable \\ref{tab:summary} with $u\\neq 0$. \nThus, we have at least one forward solution in\nall cases.\n\nAlso note from the Fig.~\\ref{fig:impactmap} \nthat impact can result in the phenomenon of\n\\textit{slip reversal}, that is where $u^+u^-<0$ so that the body will \nenter impact with slipping in one direction and exit slipping\nin the other. This phenomenon occurs in parameter regions 7-10 of\nthe figure which occurs when one of the \nparameters $k^+$ or $k^-$ is negative. \n\n\n\\subsection{Chattering and inverse chattering} \n\\label{sec:3.3}\n\nChattering, also known as the Zeno phenomenon, is the process by which\nan infinite sequence of impacts occurs in a finite period of time. In\nsingle degree-of-freedom mechanical systems, such a sequence can\neasily occur whenever there is a coefficient of restitution less than\nunity and acceleration that is towards the contact for a sufficiently\nlong period of time. The canonical example of such an impact sequence\noccurs when dropping an elastic ball on a rigid floor, and can also\noccur in general impact oscillators, see\n\\cite{Springerbook,PetriNordmark} and references therein. For systems \nwith oblique impacts, chattering sequences can \nalso converge in reverse time.\n\nTo understand this phenomenon, \nfollowing \\cite{paper2} we define a \\textit{chattering sequence} as \na rapid sequence of impacts interspersed with brief intervals of\nfree flight. To analyse such a sequence,\nwe consider a single iterate that starts immediately\nprior to the $n$th impact, as defined in the previous \nsection, and ends immediately \nprior to the $(n+1)$st impact.

In that case, restitution is deemed to end when the \nnormal impulse in $I_N = \\int \\Lambda_N$ gained during restitution is $r$ times\nthe normal impulse gained during compression, which \ndefines a Poisson coefficient of restitution $r=r_p$\n\nNote that the assumption that the \\textit{same} Coulomb friction law\nshould apply during the impact phase as in the $O(1)$-timescale motion\nis a modelling assumption that doesn't necessarily follow. \nFor example, when modelling\nimpact in a so-called superball, it has been suggested that a friction\nlaw is used where the transition between stick and slip occurs not at $u=0$ \nbut for some non-zero $u>0$~\\cite{Cross15}.\nIn truth, \nfrictional forces are temperature, timescale and spacescale dependent, \nsee e.g.~\\cite{Woodhouse}.  The impact process \\eqref{eq:impactmap} \ncan in principle be defined under different friction laws, or \nindeed for a different value of\nthe coefficient of friction $\\mu_I$ than for the $O(1)$-timescale\nmotion. \n\nNote that in general $v^-<0$, but that in parameter regions 5(b) or \n6(c) in the figure, the impact equations also have a solution \nif $v^-=0$. These regions correspond precisely to when either of the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparameters $p^+$ or $p^-$ is negative and the pre-impacting motion is\nin slip of the correct sign ($u>0$ or $u<0$ respectively).  In\nparticular these two parameter regions are precisely where an impact\ncan occur with $v^-=0$, that is an \\textit{impact without collision}.\nNote these cases map\nto the inconsistent and the indeterminate cases of \nTable \\ref{tab:summary} with $u\\neq 0$. \nThus, we have at least one forward solution in\nall cases.\n\nAlso note from the Fig.~\\ref{fig:impactmap} \nthat impact can result in the phenomenon of\n\\textit{slip reversal}, that is where $u^+u^-<0$ so that the body will \nenter impact with slipping in one direction and exit slipping\nin the other. This phenomenon occurs in parameter regions 7-10 of\nthe figure which occurs when one of the \nparameters $k^+$ or $k^-$ is negative. \n\n\n\\subsection{Chattering and inverse chattering} \n\\label{sec:3.3}\n\nChattering, also known as the Zeno phenomenon, is the process by which\nan infinite sequence of impacts occurs in a finite period of time. In\nsingle degree-of-freedom mechanical systems, such a sequence can\neasily occur whenever there is a coefficient of restitution less than\nunity and acceleration that is towards the contact for a sufficiently\nlong period of time. The canonical example of such an impact sequence\noccurs when dropping an elastic ball on a rigid floor, and can also\noccur in general impact oscillators, see\n\\cite{Springerbook,PetriNordmark} and references therein. For systems \nwith oblique impacts, chattering sequences can \nalso converge in reverse time.\n\nTo understand this phenomenon, \nfollowing \\cite{paper2} we define a \\textit{chattering sequence} as \na rapid sequence of impacts interspersed with brief intervals of\nfree flight. To analyse such a sequence,\nwe consider a single iterate that starts immediately\nprior to the $n$th impact, as defined in the previous \nsection, and ends immediately \nprior to the $(n+1)$st impact.

In order to understand which of these motions \nmay be observed in practice, it is common to examine the stability\nof these solutions.\nThere are however several notions of stability in dynamical systems, \nand the choice of an appropriate definition is made more\nsubtle by the presence of unilateral constraints. \nFundamentally though, to define stability we really need to\nunderstand two things; what kind of motion is being considered as\nbeing stable, and what kind of perturbations should we be stable against.\n\nThe simplest kind of motion is equilibrium. Equilibrium configurations\nin contact only exist if every contact is in stick. \nWe shall consider the case of multiple contact points in Sec.~\\ref{sec:6}. \nFor the present we shall confine\nourselves to configurations with a single point of contact. \nOne characterisation of stability of an equilibrium in stick contact is\nthat the the system should resist small variations of \nexternal forces.\nThe difficulty of such a definition is that such forces are not usually \nconsidered as states of the system, rather as external inputs or parameters.\nQualitative invariance of the state of a dynamical system under changes to \ninputs or parameters is sometimes referred to as robustness (or roughness)\nof the system, or more general to structural stability rather than dynamic\nstability. Stability to changes in external forces is sometimes therefore\nstudied by contact regularisation, in which a (large) finite contact \nstiffness is introduced, so that a change in force \nnecessarily implies a change in the system state. \nContact regularisation in the normal direction forms the\nsubject of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4} below. \n\nMore generally, for systems with rigid contact, \nwe can distinguish between \\textit{normal stability}\nand \\textit{tangential stability}, depending on whether we allow state\nperturbations at contact points that have components in the normal\ndirection or not. Normal stability requires stability against the\npossibility of lift-off or impact, whereas tangential stability\npresumes that contact is always maintained.  The study of the former\ngenerally requires normal contact regularisation, whereas tangent\nstability can be conducted using Filippov theory \\cite{Filippov},\nwithout the need to introduce extra compliance.\n\nThe key question in tangential stability is whether general motion in stick \n(not just restricted to equilibria) can\nbe unstable to perturbations that would cause slip. This\nquestion is considered in \n\\cite[Sec.~3]{paper2} \nfor the 2D single-contact case. \nIt is shown that \nprovided $p^{\\pm}>0$ and the contact\nis in interior of the friction cone, then stick (with $u=0$) represents \na stable \\textit{sliding manifold} in the sense of Filippov (see also\n\\cite{Springerbook}). Thus, motion in stick in case II(iv) of Table\n\\ref{tab:summary} is\nstable to perturbations with $u\\neq 0$ except at the boundary of the friction\ncone where a straightforward transition into either positive or\nnegative slip occurs (depending on which \nedge of the friction cone is in question). \nA more subtle argument needs to be used in the case that\nstick occurs in one of the {Painlev\\'{e} } parameter regions (in cells II(ii),(iii),(v) or (vi)). In \\cite[Sec.~3]{paper2} it is shown that if stick is\nnormally stable then \\textit{a posteriori} it can be shown that stick is must\nalso be tangentially stable in the sense of Filippov. \n\nUpon consideration of a larger class of state perturbations than \njust small variations\nof external forces, the most widely used notion of stability is\nthat of \\textit{Lyapunov stability}, that any small perturbation should\nremain bounded.  A yet stronger condition\nis \\textit{asymptotic stability}, namely that such perturbations\nshould also decay exponentially.  Equilibria involving frictional\nsystems rarely possess asymptotic stability, because dry friction\ntends to create continuous equilibrium sets, and perturbations\ntypically push the system to a nearby point within the set\n\\cite{leine2008}.  Thus it is natural to discuss Lyapunov\nstability in the context of rigid-body systems with contact. \nIn the robotics community, the concept of \n\\emph{strong stability} has been proposed to refer to a case where\nstick is the only consistent mode with $u=0$ at each contact \n(see \\cite{Pang} and Sec.~\\ref{sec:6.4} below for further discussion).\nOr and Rimon \\cite{Or08a} refer to \nsuch a property as \\emph{unambiguity} and show that it\nis a necessary condition for Lyapunov stability of a stick equilibrium.\nWe propose here a generalisation of Or and Rimon's result \nto stipulate necessary and sufficient condition for \nLyapunov stability for an equilibrium in the presence of \nany conservative external loads and a single point contact. Specifically, three \nconditions must be met:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The curvatures of the object and the contact surface must ensure \na local minimum of the potential energy of external forces \nalong trajectories within stick (the $T$ mode). If this criterion is not met, \ndivergence from the equilibrium with the $T$ mode becomes possible.\n\\item The equilibrium must be unambiguous in the sense of\n\\cite{Or08a}.  Unambiguity ensures that the system may not diverge\nfrom the equilibrium state in $F$, $S_+$ or $S_-$ modes unless it\nundergoes and impact.\n\\item Additionally, upon defining the effective restitution \ncoefficient $e$ for chatter as in \\eqref{eq:edef}, then we must have \n$e<1$. \nOtherwise a small perturbation may trigger diverging reverse-chatter\nmotion. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nAnalogous conditions in the multi-contact case will be \ndiscussed in Sec. \\ref{sec:6.4}\n\n\n\\section{Resolution of paradoxes via contact regularisation}\n\\label{sec:4}\n\nReturning to Table \\ref{tab:summary}, we can see that Question 1 can\nbe resolved in the inconsistent regions by the requirement that an\nIWC must occur. This leaves the indeterminate regions.\nWe shall now analyse these cases in the sense of Question 3, by adopting\ncontact regularisation, that is, introduction of a form of finite elasticity\ninto the model and then passing to the limit that the stiffness\ntends to infinity. There are a number of different choices\nthat can be made. For example, Neimark and Smirnova \\cite{Neimark} propose\nincluding both normal and tangential compliance. However, as argued\nin the previous section, unlike normal stability, \ntangential stability can be analysed without the need to introduce \ncompliance. \nTherefore the simplest approach, adopted here, is \nto introduce \ncompliance in the normal direction only, and otherwise assume that the\nassumptions of rigid body mechanics occur, including Coulomb\nfriction. \nA good general discussion of\nnormal compliance can be found in the book by Anh \\cite{LeSuanAn_book}.\n\nIt is useful though to point out a promising \nalternative approach due to  \nSzalai \\cite{Szalai1,Szalai2}, who introduced a formulation \nthat models the response of a compliant surface through a delay kernel.  \nIn unpublished work, Berdeni \n\\cite{Berdeni} applies\nthis approach to the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox. By taking the fast wavespeed limit,\na regularisation occurs via additional continuous degrees of\nfreedom for the normal and tangential forces. \n\nFollowing Nordmark \\textit{et al} \\cite{paper2}, we replace\nthe rigid constraint $y\\geq 0$ by an assumption that there can be\nsmall $O(\\epsilon)$ excursions into $y<0$, where $\\epsilon>0$ is a\nsmall parameter. Furthermore, we suppose that the normal force is\ngiven by a specific expression\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 69188, "prevtext": "\nand define an effective normal coefficient of restitution via\nthe ratio\n\n", "index": 63, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ne := \\frac{v_{n+1}^-}{v_n^-}. \n\\label{eq:edef}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E28.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"e:=\\frac{v_{n+1}^{-}}{v_{n}^{-}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>:=</mo><mfrac><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>-</mo></msubsup><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo></msubsup></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03545.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\tilde{y}= \\epsilon^{-1}y$; $\\tilde{v}=d\\tilde{y}/d\\tilde{t}$;\n$\\tilde{t}=\\epsilon^{-1/2}t$. \nNote that the timescale associated with contact is\n$O(\\epsilon^{1/2})$, which explains the scaling of variables.

Equilibrium configurations\nin contact only exist if every contact is in stick. \nWe shall consider the case of multiple contact points in Sec.~\\ref{sec:6}. \nFor the present we shall confine\nourselves to configurations with a single point of contact. \nOne characterisation of stability of an equilibrium in stick contact is\nthat the the system should resist small variations of \nexternal forces.\nThe difficulty of such a definition is that such forces are not usually \nconsidered as states of the system, rather as external inputs or parameters.\nQualitative invariance of the state of a dynamical system under changes to \ninputs or parameters is sometimes referred to as robustness (or roughness)\nof the system, or more general to structural stability rather than dynamic\nstability. Stability to changes in external forces is sometimes therefore\nstudied by contact regularisation, in which a (large) finite contact \nstiffness is introduced, so that a change in force \nnecessarily implies a change in the system state. \nContact regularisation in the normal direction forms the\nsubject of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4} below. \n\nMore generally, for systems with rigid contact, \nwe can distinguish between \\textit{normal stability}\nand \\textit{tangential stability}, depending on whether we allow state\nperturbations at contact points that have components in the normal\ndirection or not. Normal stability requires stability against the\npossibility of lift-off or impact, whereas tangential stability\npresumes that contact is always maintained.  The study of the former\ngenerally requires normal contact regularisation, whereas tangent\nstability can be conducted using Filippov theory \\cite{Filippov},\nwithout the need to introduce extra compliance.\n\nThe key question in tangential stability is whether general motion in stick \n(not just restricted to equilibria) can\nbe unstable to perturbations that would cause slip. This\nquestion is considered in \n\\cite[Sec.~3]{paper2} \nfor the 2D single-contact case. \nIt is shown that \nprovided $p^{\\pm}>0$ and the contact\nis in interior of the friction cone, then stick (with $u=0$) represents \na stable \\textit{sliding manifold} in the sense of Filippov (see also\n\\cite{Springerbook}). Thus, motion in stick in case II(iv) of Table\n\\ref{tab:summary} is\nstable to perturbations with $u\\neq 0$ except at the boundary of the friction\ncone where a straightforward transition into either positive or\nnegative slip occurs (depending on which \nedge of the friction cone is in question). \nA more subtle argument needs to be used in the case that\nstick occurs in one of the {Painlev\\'{e} } parameter regions (in cells II(ii),(iii),(v) or (vi)). In \\cite[Sec.~3]{paper2} it is shown that if stick is\nnormally stable then \\textit{a posteriori} it can be shown that stick is must\nalso be tangentially stable in the sense of Filippov. \n\nUpon consideration of a larger class of state perturbations than \njust small variations\nof external forces, the most widely used notion of stability is\nthat of \\textit{Lyapunov stability}, that any small perturbation should\nremain bounded.  A yet stronger condition\nis \\textit{asymptotic stability}, namely that such perturbations\nshould also decay exponentially.  Equilibria involving frictional\nsystems rarely possess asymptotic stability, because dry friction\ntends to create continuous equilibrium sets, and perturbations\ntypically push the system to a nearby point within the set\n\\cite{leine2008}.  Thus it is natural to discuss Lyapunov\nstability in the context of rigid-body systems with contact. \nIn the robotics community, the concept of \n\\emph{strong stability} has been proposed to refer to a case where\nstick is the only consistent mode with $u=0$ at each contact \n(see \\cite{Pang} and Sec.~\\ref{sec:6.4} below for further discussion).\nOr and Rimon \\cite{Or08a} refer to \nsuch a property as \\emph{unambiguity} and show that it\nis a necessary condition for Lyapunov stability of a stick equilibrium.\nWe propose here a generalisation of Or and Rimon's result \nto stipulate necessary and sufficient condition for \nLyapunov stability for an equilibrium in the presence of \nany conservative external loads and a single point contact. Specifically, three \nconditions must be met:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The curvatures of the object and the contact surface must ensure \na local minimum of the potential energy of external forces \nalong trajectories within stick (the $T$ mode). If this criterion is not met, \ndivergence from the equilibrium with the $T$ mode becomes possible.\n\\item The equilibrium must be unambiguous in the sense of\n\\cite{Or08a}.  Unambiguity ensures that the system may not diverge\nfrom the equilibrium state in $F$, $S_+$ or $S_-$ modes unless it\nundergoes and impact.\n\\item Additionally, upon defining the effective restitution \ncoefficient $e$ for chatter as in \\eqref{eq:edef}, then we must have \n$e<1$. \nOtherwise a small perturbation may trigger diverging reverse-chatter\nmotion. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nAnalogous conditions in the multi-contact case will be \ndiscussed in Sec. \\ref{sec:6.4}\n\n\n\\section{Resolution of paradoxes via contact regularisation}\n\\label{sec:4}\n\nReturning to Table \\ref{tab:summary}, we can see that Question 1 can\nbe resolved in the inconsistent regions by the requirement that an\nIWC must occur. This leaves the indeterminate regions.\nWe shall now analyse these cases in the sense of Question 3, by adopting\ncontact regularisation, that is, introduction of a form of finite elasticity\ninto the model and then passing to the limit that the stiffness\ntends to infinity. There are a number of different choices\nthat can be made. For example, Neimark and Smirnova \\cite{Neimark} propose\nincluding both normal and tangential compliance. However, as argued\nin the previous section, unlike normal stability, \ntangential stability can be analysed without the need to introduce \ncompliance. \nTherefore the simplest approach, adopted here, is \nto introduce \ncompliance in the normal direction only, and otherwise assume that the\nassumptions of rigid body mechanics occur, including Coulomb\nfriction. \nA good general discussion of\nnormal compliance can be found in the book by Anh \\cite{LeSuanAn_book}.\n\nIt is useful though to point out a promising \nalternative approach due to  \nSzalai \\cite{Szalai1,Szalai2}, who introduced a formulation \nthat models the response of a compliant surface through a delay kernel.  \nIn unpublished work, Berdeni \n\\cite{Berdeni} applies\nthis approach to the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox. By taking the fast wavespeed limit,\na regularisation occurs via additional continuous degrees of\nfreedom for the normal and tangential forces. \n\nFollowing Nordmark \\textit{et al} \\cite{paper2}, we replace\nthe rigid constraint $y\\geq 0$ by an assumption that there can be\nsmall $O(\\epsilon)$ excursions into $y<0$, where $\\epsilon>0$ is a\nsmall parameter. Furthermore, we suppose that the normal force is\ngiven by a specific expression\n\n", "index": 65, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\lambda_N (\\tilde{y},\\tilde{v}) = \n\\begin{cases} \n 0                                 & \\text{for }  \\tilde{y}\\geq 0, \\: \n\\tilde{v}\\geq 0 \\:,  \\\\\nf_N(\\tilde{y},\\tilde{v})    & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n\\label{eq:stiffmodel}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E29.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\lambda_{N}(\\tilde{y},\\tilde{v})=\\begin{cases}0&amp;\\text{for }\\tilde{y}\\geq 0,\\&gt;%&#10;\\tilde{v}\\geq 0\\&gt;,\\\\&#10;f_{N}(\\tilde{y},\\tilde{v})&amp;\\text{otherwise},\\end{cases}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">~</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">~</mo></mover><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mn>0</mn></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mtext>for\u00a0</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">~</mo></mover></mrow><mo>\u2265</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.7pt\">,</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">~</mo></mover><mo>\u2265</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.2pt\"><mn>0</mn></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">~</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">~</mo></mover><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mtext>otherwise</mtext><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03545.tex", "nexttext": "\n\\item $f_N$ is dissipative \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 81867, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\tilde{y}= \\epsilon^{-1}y$; $\\tilde{v}=d\\tilde{y}/d\\tilde{t}$;\n$\\tilde{t}=\\epsilon^{-1/2}t$. \nNote that the timescale associated with contact is\n$O(\\epsilon^{1/2})$, which explains the scaling of variables.

The four possible cases are \nillustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:phaseportraits}(A-D). \nIf $b<0<p^+$ (case I(iv)) then the normal dynamics has a \nglobally attractive equilibrium corresponding\nto positive slip. In contrast, if $b>0>p^+$ (case I(iii)) the \npositive slip normal equilibrium corresponds to a saddle point, \nand trajectories converge to $\\tilde{y}=+\\infty$ (liftoff) \nor $\\tilde{y}=-\\infty$ (IWC) depending on initial conditions. \nIn the remaining two cases, slipping was found\ninconsistent in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3}. Accordingly the dynamics of the compliant\ncontacts has no equilibrium and every trajectory converges to\n$\\tilde{y}=+\\infty$ if $0<b,p^+$, or to $\\tilde{y}=-\\infty$ if\n$0>b,p^+$. This picture confirms the result that the contact undergoes\nliftoff in case I(i) and IWC in case I(iv). \n\nConsider now initial conditions for which $u=0$. Then in all cases\nother than II(ii-iii), phase portraits like\nFig.~\\ref{fig:phaseportraits}(A) or (C) occur where now the normal\nequilibrium corresponds to stick rather than slip if the equilibrium\nis in the interior of the friction cone.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:phaseportraits}(E) and (F) illustrate the possibly\nindeterminate case II(iii) (case II(ii) is similar).

To the left of this line, the contact remains in stick,\nwhereas to the right of this line it has positive tangential\nacceleration so that slip or lift-off must occur. Crossing from left\nto right corresponds to a stick-slip transition, whereas crossing from\nright to left does not represent a transition because $u>0$. These\nlatter trajectories do not follow the depicted (sticking) vector field\nas long as the tangential velocity of the contact point remains\npositive; one such trajectory is depicted by a dot-dashed\nline. Nevertheless we see in this case that all initial conditions\neventually lead to lift-off, and so $F$ remains the only mode.\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:phaseportraits}(F) illustrates the other branch of the\n``or'' in cell II(iii) of Table \\ref{tab:summary} in which there are\nadditional feasible $T$ and $S_+$ modes.  Here we see that the $T$\nmode represents a stable focus whereas slipping $S_+$ can be seen to\nbe a saddle point, and hence unstable, in accordance with the\ncalculations in Secs.~ 4.2 and 3.3 above. Note though that there is\nstill indeterminacy in this case, because lift off (mode $F$) is\nanother possibility, which is represented here by trajectories\ndiverging to positive infinity in $y$. Note that the stable manifold\nof the saddle separates trajectories that are attracted to mode $T$\nfrom those which lift-off.\n\n\\section{Triggered transitions between states}\n\\label{sec:5}\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we focus on Question 2, namely what are the generic ways\nin which a configuration can enter a {Painlev\\'{e} } region and what must then happen.\nTheoretically, there are only two ways of reaching sustained contact in \na {Painlev\\'{e} } state; (1) moving from non-{Painlev\\'{e} } contact to {Painlev\\'{e} } contact, or \n(2) establishing sustained contact via the termination of a chattering \nsequence, inside the {Painlev\\'{e} } regime. We deal with these two possibilities in\nthe next two subsections. We shall then look at ways in which reverse chatter\nmay be triggered while in contact.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Entering a {Painlev\\'{e} } region within contact; the G-spot}\n\\label{sec:5.1}\n\n\nSuppose at some time $t_0$ that a rigid-body system \nis contact with both $p^\\pm>0$. \nWe want to know how to continue the dynamics for $t>t_0$. Note that \nparameters $p^{\\pm}$, $a$ and $b$ will be smooth functions\nof time provided the body doesn't change its \nmode of motion (between stick, slip or free motion). \nThe analysis in the previous section shows that \nany body in stick should remain in stick provided it remains in\nthe friction cone. In particular a change of sign of $p^\\pm$ would not\naffect the mode of motion. This is not true of slip though. As we have seen,\nif the appropriate {Painlev\\'{e} } parameter becomes negative, then \nslip changes from being highly stable to highly unstable. \n\nFor definiteness let us consider a positive slip $u>0$ within region\nI(iv) of Table \\ref{tab:summary2}; the analysis for negative slip is\nsimilar. We are interested in where $p^+$ being close to zero for $b<0$. So\nsuppose we have an initial condition with\n$0<p^+ \\ll 1$. Hence, according to \\eqref{eq:udotslip+}\nthe contact force $\\lambda_N$ is large. In particular,\nwe can see that if $p^+ \\to 0$ while $b$ remained finite, then \n$\\lambda_N \\to +\\infty$ which implies $\\lambda_T =-\\mu \\lambda_N \\to -\\infty$. \nLarge contact force means large accelerations. When viewed in state\nspace, we find that these large accelerations must cause motion \nin the direction tangent to the  boundary $p^+=0$, and so the boundary cannot\nbe crossed transversely. \n\nIn the case of systems with three degrees-of-freedom\nlike the CPP, and any system composed of a single rigid body with a\nunique point contact, then the \nset $p^+=0$ is a 1-dimensional sub-manifold of the set \nof slipping trajectories.\nA more precise analysis can be performed by realising that the above\narguments show the dynamics of slip becomes singular as $p^+ \\to 0$ and\nrescaling time appropriately.\nFollowing G\\'{e}not and Brogliato \n\\cite{Genot1999} it then can be shown that $p^+=0$ is composed of a solution \ntrajectory in this rescaled time. Thus, there can be no\ncrossing into the {Painlev\\'{e} } region except possibly at a singular point\nof the rescaled slipping vector field.  The only such \nsingular point of in this case is where $b=p^+=0$. \n\nThe analysis in \\cite{Genot1999}  was specific to\nthe CPP; we sketch here a generalisation of what must occur for\nany system close to the so-called G-spot, $b=p=0$, \na complete version of which\nwill appear elsewhere \\cite{paper3}.\nThe trick in\n\\cite{Genot1999} is to analysis the problem by rescaling\ntime \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 90383, "prevtext": "\nwhere $k,q <0$.

In contrast, if $b>0>p^+$ (case I(iii)) the \npositive slip normal equilibrium corresponds to a saddle point, \nand trajectories converge to $\\tilde{y}=+\\infty$ (liftoff) \nor $\\tilde{y}=-\\infty$ (IWC) depending on initial conditions. \nIn the remaining two cases, slipping was found\ninconsistent in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3}. Accordingly the dynamics of the compliant\ncontacts has no equilibrium and every trajectory converges to\n$\\tilde{y}=+\\infty$ if $0<b,p^+$, or to $\\tilde{y}=-\\infty$ if\n$0>b,p^+$. This picture confirms the result that the contact undergoes\nliftoff in case I(i) and IWC in case I(iv). \n\nConsider now initial conditions for which $u=0$. Then in all cases\nother than II(ii-iii), phase portraits like\nFig.~\\ref{fig:phaseportraits}(A) or (C) occur where now the normal\nequilibrium corresponds to stick rather than slip if the equilibrium\nis in the interior of the friction cone.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:phaseportraits}(E) and (F) illustrate the possibly\nindeterminate case II(iii) (case II(ii) is similar).  Panel E\nrepresents the case where the configuration (ignoring normal\ncompliance) is outside of the friction cone and the only possibility\nis motion in $F$ mode.  Here a dashed line shows those states for\nwhich zero tangential acceleration requires $\\lambda_T= - \\mu\n\\lambda_N$. To the left of this line, the contact remains in stick,\nwhereas to the right of this line it has positive tangential\nacceleration so that slip or lift-off must occur. Crossing from left\nto right corresponds to a stick-slip transition, whereas crossing from\nright to left does not represent a transition because $u>0$. These\nlatter trajectories do not follow the depicted (sticking) vector field\nas long as the tangential velocity of the contact point remains\npositive; one such trajectory is depicted by a dot-dashed\nline. Nevertheless we see in this case that all initial conditions\neventually lead to lift-off, and so $F$ remains the only mode.\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:phaseportraits}(F) illustrates the other branch of the\n``or'' in cell II(iii) of Table \\ref{tab:summary} in which there are\nadditional feasible $T$ and $S_+$ modes.  Here we see that the $T$\nmode represents a stable focus whereas slipping $S_+$ can be seen to\nbe a saddle point, and hence unstable, in accordance with the\ncalculations in Secs.~ 4.2 and 3.3 above. Note though that there is\nstill indeterminacy in this case, because lift off (mode $F$) is\nanother possibility, which is represented here by trajectories\ndiverging to positive infinity in $y$. Note that the stable manifold\nof the saddle separates trajectories that are attracted to mode $T$\nfrom those which lift-off.\n\n\\section{Triggered transitions between states}\n\\label{sec:5}\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we focus on Question 2, namely what are the generic ways\nin which a configuration can enter a {Painlev\\'{e} } region and what must then happen.\nTheoretically, there are only two ways of reaching sustained contact in \na {Painlev\\'{e} } state; (1) moving from non-{Painlev\\'{e} } contact to {Painlev\\'{e} } contact, or \n(2) establishing sustained contact via the termination of a chattering \nsequence, inside the {Painlev\\'{e} } regime. We deal with these two possibilities in\nthe next two subsections. We shall then look at ways in which reverse chatter\nmay be triggered while in contact.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Entering a {Painlev\\'{e} } region within contact; the G-spot}\n\\label{sec:5.1}\n\n\nSuppose at some time $t_0$ that a rigid-body system \nis contact with both $p^\\pm>0$. \nWe want to know how to continue the dynamics for $t>t_0$. Note that \nparameters $p^{\\pm}$, $a$ and $b$ will be smooth functions\nof time provided the body doesn't change its \nmode of motion (between stick, slip or free motion). \nThe analysis in the previous section shows that \nany body in stick should remain in stick provided it remains in\nthe friction cone. In particular a change of sign of $p^\\pm$ would not\naffect the mode of motion. This is not true of slip though. As we have seen,\nif the appropriate {Painlev\\'{e} } parameter becomes negative, then \nslip changes from being highly stable to highly unstable. \n\nFor definiteness let us consider a positive slip $u>0$ within region\nI(iv) of Table \\ref{tab:summary2}; the analysis for negative slip is\nsimilar. We are interested in where $p^+$ being close to zero for $b<0$. So\nsuppose we have an initial condition with\n$0<p^+ \\ll 1$. Hence, according to \\eqref{eq:udotslip+}\nthe contact force $\\lambda_N$ is large. In particular,\nwe can see that if $p^+ \\to 0$ while $b$ remained finite, then \n$\\lambda_N \\to +\\infty$ which implies $\\lambda_T =-\\mu \\lambda_N \\to -\\infty$. \nLarge contact force means large accelerations. When viewed in state\nspace, we find that these large accelerations must cause motion \nin the direction tangent to the  boundary $p^+=0$, and so the boundary cannot\nbe crossed transversely. \n\nIn the case of systems with three degrees-of-freedom\nlike the CPP, and any system composed of a single rigid body with a\nunique point contact, then the \nset $p^+=0$ is a 1-dimensional sub-manifold of the set \nof slipping trajectories.\nA more precise analysis can be performed by realising that the above\narguments show the dynamics of slip becomes singular as $p^+ \\to 0$ and\nrescaling time appropriately.\nFollowing G\\'{e}not and Brogliato \n\\cite{Genot1999} it then can be shown that $p^+=0$ is composed of a solution \ntrajectory in this rescaled time. Thus, there can be no\ncrossing into the {Painlev\\'{e} } region except possibly at a singular point\nof the rescaled slipping vector field.  The only such \nsingular point of in this case is where $b=p^+=0$. \n\nThe analysis in \\cite{Genot1999}  was specific to\nthe CPP; we sketch here a generalisation of what must occur for\nany system close to the so-called G-spot, $b=p=0$, \na complete version of which\nwill appear elsewhere \\cite{paper3}.\nThe trick in\n\\cite{Genot1999} is to analysis the problem by rescaling\ntime \n\n", "index": 85, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ndt=p^+ ds \\label{eq:time_rescale},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E31.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"dt=p^{+}ds,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03545.tex", "nexttext": "\nhas two eigenvalues $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_3$ with eigenvectors\n$(\\alpha_{1}-\\alpha _{3}, \\alpha _{2})^T$ and\n$(0,1)^T$, respectively. In particular, since it always corresponds to\nan eigenvector, independently of the value the coefficients $\\alpha_{1,2,3}$, \nthe $b^+$ axis is invariant.\nThis latter fact shows immediately that an initial condition\nwith $p^+>0$, $b<0$, cannot evolve into the {Painlev\\'{e} } region $p^+<0$ except\npossibly at the G-spot $p^+=b=0$. In fact Fig.~\\ref{fig:Gspot}\nshows that there are only three possible outcomes for any open set of\ninitial conditions starting in the bottom right quadrant: \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item {\\bf lift off} via passage through $b=0$ for $p^+>0$,\n\\item {\\bf continued slip} by moving away from a neighbourhood of the origin\nwhile remaining in the bottom right quadrant,\n\\item {\\bf approaching the G-spot}. \n\\end{enumerate}\nThe first two possibilities are regular transitions that do not\ninvolve the singularity $p^+ \\to 0$. Possibility 3 is rather special though,\nand although the G-spot is an isolated codimension-two point in phase space,\nit can attract an open set of initial conditions, owing to the fact that\nit is an equilibrium point in the rescaled dynamics. \n\nNote that this third possibility can only occur in panels (c), (e) and (i) of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:Gspot}, which really split into two separate cases. \nEither convergence to the\nG-spot is tangent to the $b$ axis, or it is tangent to the \n$\\alpha_1$-eigenvector that is the line $\\alpha_2 p^+ = (\\alpha_1-\\alpha_3) b$.\nNote in the former case we have that  \n$\\lambda_N = -b/p^+ $ \nbecomes infinite, as we approach the G-spot, whereas in the former case\n$\\lambda_N$ tends to the finite limit associated with the non-trivial\neigenvector. Recalling that in the unscaled time,\nthe G-spot is reached in finite time, we thus have two possibilities:\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[G1] If $0>\\alpha_3>\\alpha_1$ and the initial condition \n$(p^+,b)$ in the lower right quadrant close to the G-spot is such that \n$\\alpha_2 p^+ < (\\alpha_1-\\alpha_3 ) b $, then the G-spot is approached in\nfinite time such that ratio $p^+/b \\to 0$ and the \nnormal force $\\lambda_N \\to \\infty$. \n\\item[G2] If $\\alpha_2<0$, $0<\\alpha_1<\\alpha_3$ then the G-spot is\napproached in finite time, and $\\lambda_N$ approaches the \nfinite limit $\\alpha_2/(\\alpha_3-\\alpha_1)>0$. \n\\end{description}\n\nEach of these cases correspond to what has been referred to in the literature\nas \\textit{dynamic jam}. What happens next beyond dynamic jam \nremains an open question. In principle after the G-spot, there could\nbe an IWC, a lift off event or even possibly a velocity jump immediately\ninto stick (recall that $u>0$ as we approach the G-spot). \nIt seems that these possibilities cannot easily be distinguished using\nthe contact regularisation approach of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Reaching a {Painlev\\'{e} } state via complete chatter}\n\\label{sec:5.2}\n\nThe analysis in Secs.~\\ref{sec:3} and \\ref{sec:4} analyse both stick\nand slip in the {Painlev\\'{e} } regions, assuming that a trajectory arrived in\nthe {Painlev\\'{e} } state by smooth evolution while in contact. We found that\nstick is unaffected by either $p^\\pm<0$, provided the body is in\nthe interior of the friction cone.  In contrast, the analysis in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:5.1} above shows that the only way to enter the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nregion while slipping is via the G-spot. What we have not investigated\nthough is whether a complete chatter sequence can end up a Zeno point\nthat is in the {Painlev\\'{e} } region.\n\nIn order for a chattering sequence to occur, we must have $b<0$. Hence\nthe indeterminate cases of stick (cells II(ii) and III(ii) in Table\n\\ref{tab:summary2}) cannot be reached. So, consider instead the possibility \nof slip.  Suppose that the parameter\n$p^+<0$ and consider the possibility of a chattering sequence leading\nto positive slip.  Here, we are in the case of impact mappings as\ndepicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:impactmap}(b). Note that any impact with an\ninitial velocity with $u^->0$, must end up with $u^+=0$. Similarly any\nimpact with $u^-<0$ ends up with $u^+\\leq 0$. Hence the only\npossibility is that the Zeno point has $u\\leq 0$. But note that there\nis no inconsistency or indeterminacy in this case (see cells I(vi) and\nII(vi) in Table \\ref{tab:summary2}). We either get stick or negative\nslip, the latter of which is consistent because $p^->0$.\n\nA similar conclusion holds if $p^-<0$, we cannot approach the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nregion for negative slip as the result of a chattering sequence.\nWe conclude that even if one of the parameters $p^\\pm<0$, it is not\npossible to have a Zeno point in the {Painlev\\'{e} } region, thus dismissing this is\na possible route into the {Painlev\\'{e} } region. \n\n\\subsection{Triggering reverse chatter}\n\nA final possibility for a complex triggered transition would be if a\nbody that is smoothly in contact, were to spontaneously undergo a reverse\nchatter sequence. This possibility was considered by Nordmark \\textit{et al}\n\\cite{paper2}, the results of which we summarise here. \n\nIn general, we can rule out such a spontaneous\ntriggering of reverese chatter in T mode by the analysis of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4.1} since, provided the body remains in the\ninterior of the friction cone, stick is stable. Similarly, the\nanalysis of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4.2} rules out the possibility of\nspontaneous triggering of reverse chatter from within a condition of\nsustained slip, as this is stable wherever it is\nconsistent (unless the border of {Painlev\\'{e}} -ness is crossed, \nwhich was shown to be impossible). \nSimilarly, reverse chatter cannot be triggered at the end\nof a forward chattering sequence, because such a sequence necessarily\nconverges to a point where $e<1$.\n\nThis leaves the possibility that reverse chatter can be triggered at\nthe boundary of one of the contact phases, namely at the termination\nof stick, or of slip. But, an analysis of the cases where $e$ can be\ngreater than one shows that these are necessarily a subset of the cases\nthat are in the interior of the friction cone. Hence it can be concluded\nthat reverse chatter can only be triggered at the end of a slip phase.\nThen, it can be argued that either a case of stick is triggered, or\nunder certain other conditions, in addition to $e>1$, we might get \nthe triggering of reverse chatter.\n\nNordmark \\textit{et al} \\cite{paper2} enumerate the details and find\nthat there are further inequality conditions on $a$, $b$, $A$, \n$B$, $C$, $\\mu$ and $r$ that determine whether reverse chatter can be triggered\nfrom a transition into stick. Then they show, by introducing a compliant\nmodel, as in Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}, that if these conditions are satisfied then\nthe situation is not uniformly resolvable. \nThat is, the precise details of\nthe compliant force $f_N$ can affect whether regular stick motion of \nreverse chatter is triggered. We are left with another indeterminate case. \n\n\\section{Multiple contact points}\n\\label{sec:6}\n\n\n\n\nLet us now consider generalisation of the previous results to systems\nwith multiple contacts. One aim is to identify which\nproperties of {Painlev\\'{e}}'s paradox are generally true, and which are\nspecific properties of single-contact systems. Moreover, we will\nuncover many extra forms of degeneracy that are unique to\nmultiple-contact point systems.\n\nOne of the main difficulties with answering Question 1 is that if\nwe allow $F$, $T$, $S_+$ and $S_-$ at each of $n$ \ncontacts, then this induces $4^n$ possible contact modes (although some of\nthem will be kinematically inadmissible). This combinatorial complexity \nmakes a consistency check for each potential combination \ncomputationally unfeasible for large $n$. In\nwhat follows we therefore focus mostly on the simplest case of just two \nfrictional contacts.\n\nIvanov \\cite{Ivanov03} considered generalisations of the CPP for a rod\nthat has two points of contacts with rough rigid surfaces under the assumption\nthat each contact undergoes slip. \nHe enumerated the conditions under which the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox appears for\nsuitably chosen external forces. The classification scheme of Ivanov\nhas recently been refined by V\\'arkonyi \n\\cite{Varkonyi15}\nto the level of our analysis in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:3.1}. A summary of and commentary on \nthese results appear in the next three subsections. \n\n\\subsection{Consistency analysis of contact modes}\n\\label{sec:6.1}\n\nTo begin with, consider a planar rigid-body system that has \ntwo point contacts, with nonzero tangential velocities: \n$x_i=y_i=v_i=0$ and $u_i>0$ for $i=1,2$. Thus there are \nfour kinematically admissible modes: $S_+S_+$, $S_+F$,\n$FS_+$, and $FF$. \nHere the two-letter symbols refer to the specific combination of modes\nat the two contacts. The contact forces and accelerations are determined\nwith the help of the equality constraints of Table \\ref{tab:summary}\nfor both contacts. A contact mode is deemed consistent, if the consistency\nconditions of Table \\ref{tab:summary} are satisfied for both contacts.\n\nThe key observation is that the general analytical expressions for\ncontact motion in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3} still apply, specifically the equation\n\\eqref{eq:normaldyn_02_slip+}, \nbut where now \n$b$ and $\\lambda_N$ are vectors in ${\\mathbb R}^2$ and $p^+$ is a matrix of size\n$2\\times2$. In this formulation, the elements $p^+_{ij}$ of $p^+$ represent the\nnormal acceleration of contact $i$ in response to a slipping contact\nforce with a normal component of unit size at contact $j$.\n\nV\\'{a}rkonyi \\cite{Varkonyi15} has recently enumerated all the consistent\nmodes under this restriction of no sticking modes. \nIn order to summarise the results of his analysis, it is convenient to \nintroduce the following notation. Let $p_j$ represent \nthe $j^{th}$ column vector of\n$p^+$ such that $p^+=[p_1\\; p_2]$. Furthermore, let $\\gamma_j$ be the\nangle between $p_j$ and vector $[1\\;0]^T$. For example, if\n$p_j=[0\\;1]^T$ then $\\gamma_j=\\pi/2$.  Similarly, we let\n$\\hat\\gamma_j$ be the angle between $-p_j$ and the vector $[1\\;0]^T$\nand $\\beta$ be the angle between $-b$ and $[1\\;0]^T$.  It can be shown\nthat the consistency of each contact mode can be determined using a\nstring of three integers\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 100201, "prevtext": "\nand then to think of the scalar variables $p^+$ and $b$ as dynamical\nquantities that evolve on the timescale $s$.  From \n\\eqref{eq:udynamics}, \\eqref{eq:vdynamics} we then obtain, \nto leading order in $p^+$ and $b$, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{d}{ds} p^+  &=& \\alpha _{1} p^+  , \\label{eq:Gspot1} \\\\\n\\frac{d}{ds}b &=&\\alpha _{2} p^+ +\\alpha _{3}b, \\label{eq:Gspot2} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\alpha _{1} &=&\\dot{q} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial q} p^+\n+\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} p^+ , \\\\\n\\alpha _{2} &=& M^{-1} f \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial \\dot{q}}+\n \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial q} \\dot{q}+\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t}, \\\\\n\\alpha _{3} &=&\nM^{-1}  \\left( \\mu c -d \\right) \n\\frac{ \\partial b}{\\partial \\dot{q}}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nHere all functions are evaluated at the codimension-two point where \n$p^+=b=0$, in which case $\\alpha_{1--3}$ are just real constants. \nSpecifically $\\alpha_{1}$ is just the time derivative \nof $p^+$ and $\\alpha_{2}$ the time derivative of $b$, whereas $\\alpha_3$ is\nthe time derivative of the dependence of $b$ on the parameter $p$. \n\nAs an example consider the CPP for a uniform rod with $m=1$, $l=2$.

To cut down the number of rows of the\ntable and sub-panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:classification}, we have used\nthe fact that each class has a dual that is obtained by swapping the\nlabels of contact 1 and contact 2. This corresponds to swapping the labels $p_1$\nand $p_2$ and reflecting both vectors in the line $45^\\circ$ line\nin each case.  The dual class $\\hat{s}_1\n\\hat{s}_2$ of each of the depicted cases $s_1 s_2$ is given in\nbrackets in the first column of Table \\ref{tab:classification},\nincluding cases that are self-dual. Note that the first two digits\n$s_1 s_2$ of any class represents the coarser classification of Ivanov\n\\cite{Ivanov03}. The last digit $s_3$ refines the classification into\nsubclasses within which the consistency of each contact mode becomes\nuniquely determined (as depicted in columns 2 to 5 of the table).  The\nsignificance of the shading of these columns and the meaning of the\nlast three columns will be explained in the next subsection.\n\nNote already that there are multiple occurrences of indeterminacy and\ninconsistency indicated in the table. For example, within class 15, subclasses\n151, 154 and 156 are indeterminate because two contact modes in each case are consistent. \nIn contrast subclasses 152 and 153 are inconsistent because there is\nno consistent contact mode for these cases. \nThere are also several examples of triple indeterminacy, \nfor example in subclass 112\nwhere $S_+S_+$ and $S_+F$ and $FS_+$ are all consistent and of \nquadruple indeterminacy where all four possible contact\nmodes are consistent, for example in subclasses 254 or 354. \n\n\nBefore going on to look at normal stability of these modes and the \npossibility\nof impact, it is worth stressing that Table \\ref{tab:classification} is\nonly a partial classification for two contacts, because it ignores stick and\ncases where negative and positive slip can simulateously occur at different contacts. \nAs far as the authors know, a general classification\nis not yet known, nor is a classification in cases where there are more than\ntwo contacts.  Nevertheless, other examples of indeterminacy are known. Two\nsuch cases were illustrated in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ambiguity}.  The left-hand panel depicts a \ncase in which the static equilibrium represents the $TT$ mode which is\nconsistent provided there is a sufficiently large friction force at the\ncontacts (solid arrows in the figure show the gravitational force and\na possible choice of reaction forces).  Simultaneously, the $FF$ mode\nis also consistent, in which case the block will just fall.  \nThe right-hand panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:ambiguity} \nillustrates a shape resting on a slope in\nwhich both the body may be in equilibrium in mode $TT$, but for which\nmotion in mode $S_+F$ is also consistent.\n\n\n\\subsection{Contact regularisation and stability analysis} \\label{sec:6.2}\n\nTo resolve the indeterminate cases, we can compute the normal \nstability of different kinds of contact via the method introduced in \nSec.~\\ref{sec:4}. That is, we introduce a contact regularisation in the normal\ndirection, linearise the ensuing equations of motion, perform\nan eigenvalue analysis on the appropriate Jacobian matrix and then pass\nto the infinite stiffness limit. \n\nApplying this methodology to the cases enumerated in\nTable~\\ref{tab:classification}, it is straightforward to see that a\ncontact in mode $F$ does not influence the normal stability.  Hence,\nthe stability analysis of the $S_+F$ and $FS_+$ contact modes is\nidentical to the analysis of $S_+$ in Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}. Specifically,\nwe obtain that $S_+F$ is stable if $p_{11}>0$ and $FS_+$ is stable if\n$p_{22}>0$. For the $S_+S_+$ mode, the simultaneous dynamics of two\ncontacts is described by a system of four first-order ODEs, and thus\nnormal stability analysis requires the study of eigenvalues of a\n$4\\times 4$ Jacobian matrix.  The Jacobian and thus the stability\nproperties of contact modes are independent of $b$. Hence the same\nresults are obtained for all subclasses within this class.\n\nThe results of the stability analysis are summarised in\nTable~\\ref{tab:classification}. Details of the calculations are presented in \\cite{Varkonyi15}. Stability information is\nindicated by shading of the appropriate cell in the table.  A dark\n(grey) shading indicates definitely unstable. Lighter (yellow, colour\nonline) shading represents where the $S_+S_+$ mode may be stable,\ndepending on further conditions. Finally, no shading represents a\nnormally stable situation.  One interesting thing to note is that the\nstability of the $S_+S_+$ mode is not uniquely determined in classes\n13, 41, 14, 31, 23 and 46. The unstable regions within these\nsubclasses are caused by so-called \\textit{mode coupling} -- a\nphenomenon studied in the context of break squeal (see\ne.g.~\\cite{Ibrahim1994,Hoffmann}).  In these regions, a system may\ncross the stability boundary during its motion. In such a situation, a\n\\textit{spontaneous contact mode transition} will occur. That is, the\nsystem would switch from the $S_+S_+$ mode to a different type of\nmotion, despite the fact that the $S_+S_+$ mode remains consistent. As\nwe argued in Secs.~\\ref{sec:3} and \\ref{sec:4} such spontaneous\ntransitions are not possible in the single-contact case.\n  \nAnother intriguing property of these sometimes unstable $S_+S_+$ regions is \nthat their exact boundaries within a subclass appear to \ndepend on the underlying compliant\ncontact model, even if the compliance parameter $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\nHence, unlike in the single-contact case, the stability of a\ncontact mode may be undecidable within rigid-body theory.\n\nA closer look at Table~\\ref{tab:classification} reveals an even more\nsurprising phenomenon. In subclasses 261 and 262, the $S_+S_+$ is the\nunique consistent contact mode. These cases appear to be free from any\nparadoxes, but nevertheless the stability analysis shows that the\n$S_+S_+$ mode is robustly unstable. Robustness is meant in the sense\nof uniform resolvability, as introduced within Question 3 in the \nIntroduction. That is, \ninstability emerges \nas $\\epsilon \\to 0$ \nfor any form of contact compliance within the\nframework of Sec.~\\ref{sec:3.2}. As we shall see in the next subsection\n(see e.g.~Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip}(A)), an IWC is likely to \nhappen in these cases. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis observation refutes an often assumed hypothesis within the rigid\nbody mechanics community that the failure of an object to slip\nsmoothly along contact surfaces is always a result of the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparadox. This philosophy is embodied in an {\\em a priori} rule \nknown as Kilmister's principle of constraints \\cite{Brogliato1999}: \n{\\em \"a unilateral\nconstraint must be verified with (bounded) forces each time it is\npossible, and with impulses if and only if it is not possible with\nforces\"}.  The observation also questions the relevance of enumerating\nevery possible consistent contact modes, which is often assumed in a\nhybrid systems or complementarity formation to be the key question in\nthe analysis of mechanical systems with frictional contacts, see\ne.g.~\\cite{Lotstedt,Pang}.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Impacts without collision} \\label{sec:6.3}\n\nLet us now consider the possibility of impact, specifically an IWC for\neach of the cases enumerated in Table \\ref{tab:classification}.\nThis is indicated\nin  last three columns of the table using a notation we shall now explain.\nA system with multiple contacts may undergo several types of impacts:\nan impulsive contact force may occur at any non-empty subset of the\ncontact points, while the rest of the contacts lift off. In the\nsimplest case of two non-sticking contacts, we have three types of IWC:\nimpulsive force at one contact while the other lifts off, which we label\nby $IF$ or $FI$ depending on which compact impacts; \nand simultaneous impact at both contacts, which we label $II$. \n\nProvided that we retain the assumption that the response \nof the object follows rigid body-theory, the $IF$ impact \nis consistent if the contact force at contact 1 seeks to push the \ncontact point into the ground and simultaneously seeks to detach the\nother point. That is we require $p_{11}<0$ and \nthe other point $p_{21}>0$. Analogously, $FI$ may occur only \nif $p_{22}<0$ and $p_{12}>0$. \n\nThe case of the $II$\nimpact is more subtle. It is a necessary condition that there must \nexists a combination of positive impulsive contact forces at the two contacts,\nwhich accelerates both contact points towards the ground. In other\nwords, the cone spanned by vectors $p_1$ and $p_2$ should intersect\nthe fourth quadrant of ${\\mathbb R}^2$. Nevertheless, this\ncondition can be shown to not be sufficient. To study the \nsimultaneous dynamics of the two\ncontacts during a double-impact process in general requires a careful\nanalysis using a compliant contact model. \n\nThus the notation in the final three columns of Table \\ref{tab:classification}\nis to indicate with an `x' where impacts of each type are possible.\nFor the case of $II$ impacts, we have indicated by `(x)'  where the necessary\nconditions are satisfied. \n\nThe results of what happens in a double impact $II$ \ncan be shown to depend heavily on the exact form of the \ncompliance model (satisfying the properties given  in Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}), \nor equivalently of the impact\nmodel.  The details will be presented\nelsewhere \\cite{Varkonyi_unp}. Computations reveal that there\nexist cases in which every contact mode is either inconsistent or\nunstable, and simultaneously, the three forms of IWC mentioned above\nare impossible, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip}(B).\nThis observation points towards the incorrectness of\nanother common assumption: that {Painlev\\'{e}}'s paradox is perfectly\nresolvable by considering IWCs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{simulation_examples.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Simulation of fast contact dynamics in examples of \n(A) class 261 and (B) class 142 using the contact model \n\\eqref{eq:linearcontact}.

Several different initial conditions are depicted\nin which the  initial time derivatives of\n$\\tilde{y}_i$ are 0. The contact model \\eqref{eq:linearcontact} is\nused in the simulation, with $k=q=-1$. For every possible initial condition, one of the two\ncontact penetrations, and\nhence the normal force diverges to minus infinity. The other contact always \nlifts off. In the rigid limit $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$ this\nbehaviour corresponds to an IWC at\none of the two contacts, and lift off at the other, that is, either mode\n$IF$ or mode $FI$. Note that the contact dynamics also has a consistent mode\n$S_+ S_+$ in which both contacts slip, marked by a square in the figure, but\nthis is unstable. The stable manifold of this point in the fast dynamics\nrepresents the dividing surface between two different types of IWC. \n\n \nFigure \\ref{fig:unstableslip}(B) shows an example within class 142 in\nwhich there is the onset of some kind of micro-scale sprag-slip\noscillation. \nHere there is also an unstable \n$S_+S_+$ mode, again represented by a square. For the parameter values\ndepicted, every other contact mode is inconsistent and IWCs are\nnot possible either.  The initial condition for the trajectory\ndepicted is\n$\\tilde{y}_1=\\tilde{y}_2=\\dot{\\tilde{y}}_1=\\dot{\\tilde{y}}_2=0$.  The\ndynamics converges to an attractive limit cycle representing slipping\nmotion accompanied by fast micro-vibration, with repeated liftoff and\nimpact at the second contact point. In the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$ this would \ncorrespond to a strange kind of sprag-slip limit cycle, for which the \nperiod is infinitesimally small. \n\nPanels C and D of Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip} show representations of\nslipping rigid bodies possessing the values of matrix $B$ that correspond\nto the cases shown in panels A and B, respectively. \nThe bodies are under the influence of gravity, whose direction is\nrepresented by the solid arrow through the centres of mass (COM). \nThe orientation of the vector $b$ for each body, depends on the slip \nvelocity, with the case illustrated corresponding to this velocity being\nclose to zero. The shape and dimension of each body and its point of \ncontact are represented graphically by a circle that shows the \nradius of gyration centred at the COM, and two solid line sections \nterminating at the contact points. The orientations of the \ncontact surfaces are represented by bold lines with hatched fills. The\nvalues of the coefficient of friction is specified by a label at each contact. \n\n\\subsection{Stability of equilibria}\n\\label{sec:6.4}\n\nStability of equilibrium configurations of rigid-body systems\nwith multiple unilateral contacts is of particular practical\nimportance in robotics, where one needs to be able to demonstrate\nthat grasping manoeuvres are robust.  In this context Pang and Trinkle\n\\cite{Pang} proposed various characterisations of stable equilibrium\nconfigurations of systems with any number of contacts.  They refer to\na configuration as exhibiting the \\textit{weak stability property} if the\n$TT..T$ mode is consistent and the \\textit{strong stability property} if\n$TT..T$ mode is the only consistent contact mode which has $u=0$ for\nall contacts.  However, they did not explore the consequences of these\nnotions of ``stability'' from the point of view of dynamical systems\ntheory. Howard and Kumar \\cite{howard96}  demonstrated \nthat the\n\\textit{strong stability} property of Pang and Trinkle is not necessary for\nstability against small external forces (structural stability) \nfor the case of a planar rigid\nbody with any number of contacts. An extension of this result to\nmultibody systems was given in \\cite{Varkonyi15b}.\n\nWe found in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3.3} that reverse chattering can occur in \na system with a single contact, if $b<0$ and the effective restitution\ncoefficient $e>1$. We\nalso pointed out in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3.4} \nthe significance of avoiding reverse chatter in proving\nLyapunov stability of equilibria.\nThe case of multiple contacts is more complex because a sequence\nof impacts may include impacts at any of the contact points in regular\n(periodic) or irregular (chaotic) order. In some cases, simultaneous\nimpacts at multiple points are also to be expected.\n\nOr and Rimon \\cite{Or08b} were the first to point out that the key\nto understanding Lyapunov stability of equilibria with \nunilateral frictional point contacts is to understand the \npossibility of reverse chattering motion of the system. \nThey developed a sufficient condition for\nLyapunov stability of a planar rigid body with two point contacts\nin the case of a specific impact law. A different sufficient condition using a\nmore realistic impact law was developed by V\\'arkonyi \\cite{Varkonyi12}, \nwho also demonstrated that reverse chattering $e>1$ may occur even \nif impacts are\npurely inelastic, i.e.~if $r_e=0$. More recently, \nV\\'{a}rkonyi and Or found an almost exact\ncondition of stability for planar bodies with two contacts and $r_e=0$, \nthe details of which will appear elsewhere \n\\cite{Varkonyi-Or_unp}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{instability.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{(Adapted from \\cite{Varkonyi12}). Simulation of the response of \na heavy planar rigid body to a small perturbation of \nits equilibrium configuration on a perfectly inelastic ($r_e=0$) \nslope. See text for details.\n\\label{fig:instability}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:instability} presents simulation results for a \nspecific example of heavy planar\nrigid body with two contact points that satisfies the strong stability property of \\cite{Pang}, \nyet is not stable in the sense of Lyapunov. \nThe shape of the body is represented by a circle and two lines \nas in Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip}, and for this simulation $r_e=0$.  \nInitially, the object is resting on a slope of angle $10^\\circ$, under\nthe influence of gravity. In this case, a static equilibrium equilibrium\nin $TT$ mode can be shown to be consistent (calculation omitted). \nNevertheless an infinitesimally small state-perturbation \nmay set the object into divergent motion, causing it to tumble down\nthe slope as illustrated. First we find accelerating slip\nmotion on leg 1, in mode $S_+F$.  This is followed by a sticking impact at leg\n2 followed by a rolling motion of that leg (i.e.~mode $FT$). This\nmode continues until leg 1 hits the ground again. \nThese four steps of motion are repeated again and again, while\nthe velocity of the object increases exponentially. The trajectories\nof the two contact points and the COM are shown by solid, dashed, and\ndotted curves, respectively in the figure. For more details, see\n\\cite{Varkonyi12}. \nIt is interesting to note that if we had taken a lower coefficient of\nfriction at leg 1, specifically if $\\mu_1<0.1$, then the initial equilibrium \nwould become ambiguous. Thus at time $t=0$ there would be an additional\npossibility for the motion, namely the behaviour displayed in the right-hand \npanels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:ambiguity}.\n\nIf nothing else, this example illustrates that these considerations\nof stability with multiple points of contact are not merely \nof academic interest, but can \nbe easily manifest in purely passive mechanical systems. Another recent\npractical illustration can be found in the work of Gamos and Or \n\\cite{GamosOr}. There they compute many details of the dynamics of\nbi-pedal passive walkers that can undergo stick-slip transitions,\nincluding several cases of multi-stability with complex \nbasins of attraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Single-point-of-contact case in 3D}\n\\label{sec:7}\n\nEverything discussed so has been for systems whose contact forces and\nmotions line in a plane. Much less is known\nabout the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox in situations that require a fully\nthree-dimensional analysis. For simplicity, we \nrestrict attention to the single contact case.   \nOur goal is to highlight similarities with and differences from \nthe planar case. In what follows we make some general observations, but\nonly do precise calculations in the case of the three-dimensional analogue\nof the CPP.\n\n\\subsection{Conditions for {Painlev\\'{e} } paradoxes to occur}\n\nFor any spatial system with a single contact, equations of motion analogous to \n\\eqref{eq:udynamics} and \\eqref{eq:vdynamics} can be derived:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 110450, "prevtext": "\nhas two eigenvalues $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_3$ with eigenvectors\n$(\\alpha_{1}-\\alpha _{3}, \\alpha _{2})^T$ and\n$(0,1)^T$, respectively. In particular, since it always corresponds to\nan eigenvector, independently of the value the coefficients $\\alpha_{1,2,3}$, \nthe $b^+$ axis is invariant.\nThis latter fact shows immediately that an initial condition\nwith $p^+>0$, $b<0$, cannot evolve into the {Painlev\\'{e} } region $p^+<0$ except\npossibly at the G-spot $p^+=b=0$. In fact Fig.~\\ref{fig:Gspot}\nshows that there are only three possible outcomes for any open set of\ninitial conditions starting in the bottom right quadrant: \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item {\\bf lift off} via passage through $b=0$ for $p^+>0$,\n\\item {\\bf continued slip} by moving away from a neighbourhood of the origin\nwhile remaining in the bottom right quadrant,\n\\item {\\bf approaching the G-spot}. \n\\end{enumerate}\nThe first two possibilities are regular transitions that do not\ninvolve the singularity $p^+ \\to 0$. Possibility 3 is rather special though,\nand although the G-spot is an isolated codimension-two point in phase space,\nit can attract an open set of initial conditions, owing to the fact that\nit is an equilibrium point in the rescaled dynamics. \n\nNote that this third possibility can only occur in panels (c), (e) and (i) of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:Gspot}, which really split into two separate cases. \nEither convergence to the\nG-spot is tangent to the $b$ axis, or it is tangent to the \n$\\alpha_1$-eigenvector that is the line $\\alpha_2 p^+ = (\\alpha_1-\\alpha_3) b$.\nNote in the former case we have that  \n$\\lambda_N = -b/p^+ $ \nbecomes infinite, as we approach the G-spot, whereas in the former case\n$\\lambda_N$ tends to the finite limit associated with the non-trivial\neigenvector. Recalling that in the unscaled time,\nthe G-spot is reached in finite time, we thus have two possibilities:\n\\begin{description}\n\\item[G1] If $0>\\alpha_3>\\alpha_1$ and the initial condition \n$(p^+,b)$ in the lower right quadrant close to the G-spot is such that \n$\\alpha_2 p^+ < (\\alpha_1-\\alpha_3 ) b $, then the G-spot is approached in\nfinite time such that ratio $p^+/b \\to 0$ and the \nnormal force $\\lambda_N \\to \\infty$. \n\\item[G2] If $\\alpha_2<0$, $0<\\alpha_1<\\alpha_3$ then the G-spot is\napproached in finite time, and $\\lambda_N$ approaches the \nfinite limit $\\alpha_2/(\\alpha_3-\\alpha_1)>0$. \n\\end{description}\n\nEach of these cases correspond to what has been referred to in the literature\nas \\textit{dynamic jam}. What happens next beyond dynamic jam \nremains an open question. In principle after the G-spot, there could\nbe an IWC, a lift off event or even possibly a velocity jump immediately\ninto stick (recall that $u>0$ as we approach the G-spot). \nIt seems that these possibilities cannot easily be distinguished using\nthe contact regularisation approach of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Reaching a {Painlev\\'{e} } state via complete chatter}\n\\label{sec:5.2}\n\nThe analysis in Secs.~\\ref{sec:3} and \\ref{sec:4} analyse both stick\nand slip in the {Painlev\\'{e} } regions, assuming that a trajectory arrived in\nthe {Painlev\\'{e} } state by smooth evolution while in contact. We found that\nstick is unaffected by either $p^\\pm<0$, provided the body is in\nthe interior of the friction cone.  In contrast, the analysis in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:5.1} above shows that the only way to enter the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nregion while slipping is via the G-spot. What we have not investigated\nthough is whether a complete chatter sequence can end up a Zeno point\nthat is in the {Painlev\\'{e} } region.\n\nIn order for a chattering sequence to occur, we must have $b<0$. Hence\nthe indeterminate cases of stick (cells II(ii) and III(ii) in Table\n\\ref{tab:summary2}) cannot be reached. So, consider instead the possibility \nof slip.  Suppose that the parameter\n$p^+<0$ and consider the possibility of a chattering sequence leading\nto positive slip.  Here, we are in the case of impact mappings as\ndepicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:impactmap}(b). Note that any impact with an\ninitial velocity with $u^->0$, must end up with $u^+=0$. Similarly any\nimpact with $u^-<0$ ends up with $u^+\\leq 0$. Hence the only\npossibility is that the Zeno point has $u\\leq 0$. But note that there\nis no inconsistency or indeterminacy in this case (see cells I(vi) and\nII(vi) in Table \\ref{tab:summary2}). We either get stick or negative\nslip, the latter of which is consistent because $p^->0$.\n\nA similar conclusion holds if $p^-<0$, we cannot approach the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nregion for negative slip as the result of a chattering sequence.\nWe conclude that even if one of the parameters $p^\\pm<0$, it is not\npossible to have a Zeno point in the {Painlev\\'{e} } region, thus dismissing this is\na possible route into the {Painlev\\'{e} } region. \n\n\\subsection{Triggering reverse chatter}\n\nA final possibility for a complex triggered transition would be if a\nbody that is smoothly in contact, were to spontaneously undergo a reverse\nchatter sequence. This possibility was considered by Nordmark \\textit{et al}\n\\cite{paper2}, the results of which we summarise here. \n\nIn general, we can rule out such a spontaneous\ntriggering of reverese chatter in T mode by the analysis of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4.1} since, provided the body remains in the\ninterior of the friction cone, stick is stable. Similarly, the\nanalysis of Sec.~\\ref{sec:4.2} rules out the possibility of\nspontaneous triggering of reverse chatter from within a condition of\nsustained slip, as this is stable wherever it is\nconsistent (unless the border of {Painlev\\'{e}} -ness is crossed, \nwhich was shown to be impossible). \nSimilarly, reverse chatter cannot be triggered at the end\nof a forward chattering sequence, because such a sequence necessarily\nconverges to a point where $e<1$.\n\nThis leaves the possibility that reverse chatter can be triggered at\nthe boundary of one of the contact phases, namely at the termination\nof stick, or of slip. But, an analysis of the cases where $e$ can be\ngreater than one shows that these are necessarily a subset of the cases\nthat are in the interior of the friction cone. Hence it can be concluded\nthat reverse chatter can only be triggered at the end of a slip phase.\nThen, it can be argued that either a case of stick is triggered, or\nunder certain other conditions, in addition to $e>1$, we might get \nthe triggering of reverse chatter.\n\nNordmark \\textit{et al} \\cite{paper2} enumerate the details and find\nthat there are further inequality conditions on $a$, $b$, $A$, \n$B$, $C$, $\\mu$ and $r$ that determine whether reverse chatter can be triggered\nfrom a transition into stick. Then they show, by introducing a compliant\nmodel, as in Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}, that if these conditions are satisfied then\nthe situation is not uniformly resolvable. \nThat is, the precise details of\nthe compliant force $f_N$ can affect whether regular stick motion of \nreverse chatter is triggered. We are left with another indeterminate case. \n\n\\section{Multiple contact points}\n\\label{sec:6}\n\n\n\n\nLet us now consider generalisation of the previous results to systems\nwith multiple contacts. One aim is to identify which\nproperties of {Painlev\\'{e}}'s paradox are generally true, and which are\nspecific properties of single-contact systems. Moreover, we will\nuncover many extra forms of degeneracy that are unique to\nmultiple-contact point systems.\n\nOne of the main difficulties with answering Question 1 is that if\nwe allow $F$, $T$, $S_+$ and $S_-$ at each of $n$ \ncontacts, then this induces $4^n$ possible contact modes (although some of\nthem will be kinematically inadmissible). This combinatorial complexity \nmakes a consistency check for each potential combination \ncomputationally unfeasible for large $n$. In\nwhat follows we therefore focus mostly on the simplest case of just two \nfrictional contacts.\n\nIvanov \\cite{Ivanov03} considered generalisations of the CPP for a rod\nthat has two points of contacts with rough rigid surfaces under the assumption\nthat each contact undergoes slip. \nHe enumerated the conditions under which the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox appears for\nsuitably chosen external forces. The classification scheme of Ivanov\nhas recently been refined by V\\'arkonyi \n\\cite{Varkonyi15}\nto the level of our analysis in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:3.1}. A summary of and commentary on \nthese results appear in the next three subsections. \n\n\\subsection{Consistency analysis of contact modes}\n\\label{sec:6.1}\n\nTo begin with, consider a planar rigid-body system that has \ntwo point contacts, with nonzero tangential velocities: \n$x_i=y_i=v_i=0$ and $u_i>0$ for $i=1,2$. Thus there are \nfour kinematically admissible modes: $S_+S_+$, $S_+F$,\n$FS_+$, and $FF$. \nHere the two-letter symbols refer to the specific combination of modes\nat the two contacts. The contact forces and accelerations are determined\nwith the help of the equality constraints of Table \\ref{tab:summary}\nfor both contacts. A contact mode is deemed consistent, if the consistency\nconditions of Table \\ref{tab:summary} are satisfied for both contacts.\n\nThe key observation is that the general analytical expressions for\ncontact motion in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3} still apply, specifically the equation\n\\eqref{eq:normaldyn_02_slip+}, \nbut where now \n$b$ and $\\lambda_N$ are vectors in ${\\mathbb R}^2$ and $p^+$ is a matrix of size\n$2\\times2$. In this formulation, the elements $p^+_{ij}$ of $p^+$ represent the\nnormal acceleration of contact $i$ in response to a slipping contact\nforce with a normal component of unit size at contact $j$.\n\nV\\'{a}rkonyi \\cite{Varkonyi15} has recently enumerated all the consistent\nmodes under this restriction of no sticking modes. \nIn order to summarise the results of his analysis, it is convenient to \nintroduce the following notation. Let $p_j$ represent \nthe $j^{th}$ column vector of\n$p^+$ such that $p^+=[p_1\\; p_2]$. Furthermore, let $\\gamma_j$ be the\nangle between $p_j$ and vector $[1\\;0]^T$. For example, if\n$p_j=[0\\;1]^T$ then $\\gamma_j=\\pi/2$.  Similarly, we let\n$\\hat\\gamma_j$ be the angle between $-p_j$ and the vector $[1\\;0]^T$\nand $\\beta$ be the angle between $-b$ and $[1\\;0]^T$.  It can be shown\nthat the consistency of each contact mode can be determined using a\nstring of three integers\n\n", "index": 89, "text": "$$\ns_1 s_2 s_3, \\quad \\mbox{where} \\quad s_1 \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}, \\quad \ns_{2,3} \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots 6\\},\n$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex18.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"s_{1}s_{2}s_{3},\\quad\\mbox{where}\\quad s_{1}\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\},\\quad s_{2,3}\\in\\{1%&#10;,2,\\ldots 6\\},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><mtext>where</mtext><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mo>\u2208</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>4</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub><mo>\u2208</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03545.tex", "nexttext": "  \nwhere now the tangential velocity $u \\in {\\mathbb R}^2$ is a 2-vector, \nas are $a$, $B$, and $\\lambda_T$, \nwhereas $A$ becomes a $2\\times 2$ matrix.

To cut down the number of rows of the\ntable and sub-panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:classification}, we have used\nthe fact that each class has a dual that is obtained by swapping the\nlabels of contact 1 and contact 2. This corresponds to swapping the labels $p_1$\nand $p_2$ and reflecting both vectors in the line $45^\\circ$ line\nin each case.  The dual class $\\hat{s}_1\n\\hat{s}_2$ of each of the depicted cases $s_1 s_2$ is given in\nbrackets in the first column of Table \\ref{tab:classification},\nincluding cases that are self-dual. Note that the first two digits\n$s_1 s_2$ of any class represents the coarser classification of Ivanov\n\\cite{Ivanov03}. The last digit $s_3$ refines the classification into\nsubclasses within which the consistency of each contact mode becomes\nuniquely determined (as depicted in columns 2 to 5 of the table).  The\nsignificance of the shading of these columns and the meaning of the\nlast three columns will be explained in the next subsection.\n\nNote already that there are multiple occurrences of indeterminacy and\ninconsistency indicated in the table. For example, within class 15, subclasses\n151, 154 and 156 are indeterminate because two contact modes in each case are consistent. \nIn contrast subclasses 152 and 153 are inconsistent because there is\nno consistent contact mode for these cases. \nThere are also several examples of triple indeterminacy, \nfor example in subclass 112\nwhere $S_+S_+$ and $S_+F$ and $FS_+$ are all consistent and of \nquadruple indeterminacy where all four possible contact\nmodes are consistent, for example in subclasses 254 or 354. \n\n\nBefore going on to look at normal stability of these modes and the \npossibility\nof impact, it is worth stressing that Table \\ref{tab:classification} is\nonly a partial classification for two contacts, because it ignores stick and\ncases where negative and positive slip can simulateously occur at different contacts. \nAs far as the authors know, a general classification\nis not yet known, nor is a classification in cases where there are more than\ntwo contacts.  Nevertheless, other examples of indeterminacy are known. Two\nsuch cases were illustrated in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ambiguity}.  The left-hand panel depicts a \ncase in which the static equilibrium represents the $TT$ mode which is\nconsistent provided there is a sufficiently large friction force at the\ncontacts (solid arrows in the figure show the gravitational force and\na possible choice of reaction forces).  Simultaneously, the $FF$ mode\nis also consistent, in which case the block will just fall.  \nThe right-hand panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:ambiguity} \nillustrates a shape resting on a slope in\nwhich both the body may be in equilibrium in mode $TT$, but for which\nmotion in mode $S_+F$ is also consistent.\n\n\n\\subsection{Contact regularisation and stability analysis} \\label{sec:6.2}\n\nTo resolve the indeterminate cases, we can compute the normal \nstability of different kinds of contact via the method introduced in \nSec.~\\ref{sec:4}. That is, we introduce a contact regularisation in the normal\ndirection, linearise the ensuing equations of motion, perform\nan eigenvalue analysis on the appropriate Jacobian matrix and then pass\nto the infinite stiffness limit. \n\nApplying this methodology to the cases enumerated in\nTable~\\ref{tab:classification}, it is straightforward to see that a\ncontact in mode $F$ does not influence the normal stability.  Hence,\nthe stability analysis of the $S_+F$ and $FS_+$ contact modes is\nidentical to the analysis of $S_+$ in Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}. Specifically,\nwe obtain that $S_+F$ is stable if $p_{11}>0$ and $FS_+$ is stable if\n$p_{22}>0$. For the $S_+S_+$ mode, the simultaneous dynamics of two\ncontacts is described by a system of four first-order ODEs, and thus\nnormal stability analysis requires the study of eigenvalues of a\n$4\\times 4$ Jacobian matrix.  The Jacobian and thus the stability\nproperties of contact modes are independent of $b$. Hence the same\nresults are obtained for all subclasses within this class.\n\nThe results of the stability analysis are summarised in\nTable~\\ref{tab:classification}. Details of the calculations are presented in \\cite{Varkonyi15}. Stability information is\nindicated by shading of the appropriate cell in the table.  A dark\n(grey) shading indicates definitely unstable. Lighter (yellow, colour\nonline) shading represents where the $S_+S_+$ mode may be stable,\ndepending on further conditions. Finally, no shading represents a\nnormally stable situation.  One interesting thing to note is that the\nstability of the $S_+S_+$ mode is not uniquely determined in classes\n13, 41, 14, 31, 23 and 46. The unstable regions within these\nsubclasses are caused by so-called \\textit{mode coupling} -- a\nphenomenon studied in the context of break squeal (see\ne.g.~\\cite{Ibrahim1994,Hoffmann}).  In these regions, a system may\ncross the stability boundary during its motion. In such a situation, a\n\\textit{spontaneous contact mode transition} will occur. That is, the\nsystem would switch from the $S_+S_+$ mode to a different type of\nmotion, despite the fact that the $S_+S_+$ mode remains consistent. As\nwe argued in Secs.~\\ref{sec:3} and \\ref{sec:4} such spontaneous\ntransitions are not possible in the single-contact case.\n  \nAnother intriguing property of these sometimes unstable $S_+S_+$ regions is \nthat their exact boundaries within a subclass appear to \ndepend on the underlying compliant\ncontact model, even if the compliance parameter $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\nHence, unlike in the single-contact case, the stability of a\ncontact mode may be undecidable within rigid-body theory.\n\nA closer look at Table~\\ref{tab:classification} reveals an even more\nsurprising phenomenon. In subclasses 261 and 262, the $S_+S_+$ is the\nunique consistent contact mode. These cases appear to be free from any\nparadoxes, but nevertheless the stability analysis shows that the\n$S_+S_+$ mode is robustly unstable. Robustness is meant in the sense\nof uniform resolvability, as introduced within Question 3 in the \nIntroduction. That is, \ninstability emerges \nas $\\epsilon \\to 0$ \nfor any form of contact compliance within the\nframework of Sec.~\\ref{sec:3.2}. As we shall see in the next subsection\n(see e.g.~Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip}(A)), an IWC is likely to \nhappen in these cases. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis observation refutes an often assumed hypothesis within the rigid\nbody mechanics community that the failure of an object to slip\nsmoothly along contact surfaces is always a result of the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparadox. This philosophy is embodied in an {\\em a priori} rule \nknown as Kilmister's principle of constraints \\cite{Brogliato1999}: \n{\\em \"a unilateral\nconstraint must be verified with (bounded) forces each time it is\npossible, and with impulses if and only if it is not possible with\nforces\"}.  The observation also questions the relevance of enumerating\nevery possible consistent contact modes, which is often assumed in a\nhybrid systems or complementarity formation to be the key question in\nthe analysis of mechanical systems with frictional contacts, see\ne.g.~\\cite{Lotstedt,Pang}.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Impacts without collision} \\label{sec:6.3}\n\nLet us now consider the possibility of impact, specifically an IWC for\neach of the cases enumerated in Table \\ref{tab:classification}.\nThis is indicated\nin  last three columns of the table using a notation we shall now explain.\nA system with multiple contacts may undergo several types of impacts:\nan impulsive contact force may occur at any non-empty subset of the\ncontact points, while the rest of the contacts lift off. In the\nsimplest case of two non-sticking contacts, we have three types of IWC:\nimpulsive force at one contact while the other lifts off, which we label\nby $IF$ or $FI$ depending on which compact impacts; \nand simultaneous impact at both contacts, which we label $II$. \n\nProvided that we retain the assumption that the response \nof the object follows rigid body-theory, the $IF$ impact \nis consistent if the contact force at contact 1 seeks to push the \ncontact point into the ground and simultaneously seeks to detach the\nother point. That is we require $p_{11}<0$ and \nthe other point $p_{21}>0$. Analogously, $FI$ may occur only \nif $p_{22}<0$ and $p_{12}>0$. \n\nThe case of the $II$\nimpact is more subtle. It is a necessary condition that there must \nexists a combination of positive impulsive contact forces at the two contacts,\nwhich accelerates both contact points towards the ground. In other\nwords, the cone spanned by vectors $p_1$ and $p_2$ should intersect\nthe fourth quadrant of ${\\mathbb R}^2$. Nevertheless, this\ncondition can be shown to not be sufficient. To study the \nsimultaneous dynamics of the two\ncontacts during a double-impact process in general requires a careful\nanalysis using a compliant contact model. \n\nThus the notation in the final three columns of Table \\ref{tab:classification}\nis to indicate with an `x' where impacts of each type are possible.\nFor the case of $II$ impacts, we have indicated by `(x)'  where the necessary\nconditions are satisfied. \n\nThe results of what happens in a double impact $II$ \ncan be shown to depend heavily on the exact form of the \ncompliance model (satisfying the properties given  in Sec.~\\ref{sec:4}), \nor equivalently of the impact\nmodel.  The details will be presented\nelsewhere \\cite{Varkonyi_unp}. Computations reveal that there\nexist cases in which every contact mode is either inconsistent or\nunstable, and simultaneously, the three forms of IWC mentioned above\nare impossible, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip}(B).\nThis observation points towards the incorrectness of\nanother common assumption: that {Painlev\\'{e}}'s paradox is perfectly\nresolvable by considering IWCs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{simulation_examples.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Simulation of fast contact dynamics in examples of \n(A) class 261 and (B) class 142 using the contact model \n\\eqref{eq:linearcontact}.

Several different initial conditions are depicted\nin which the  initial time derivatives of\n$\\tilde{y}_i$ are 0. The contact model \\eqref{eq:linearcontact} is\nused in the simulation, with $k=q=-1$. For every possible initial condition, one of the two\ncontact penetrations, and\nhence the normal force diverges to minus infinity. The other contact always \nlifts off. In the rigid limit $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$ this\nbehaviour corresponds to an IWC at\none of the two contacts, and lift off at the other, that is, either mode\n$IF$ or mode $FI$. Note that the contact dynamics also has a consistent mode\n$S_+ S_+$ in which both contacts slip, marked by a square in the figure, but\nthis is unstable. The stable manifold of this point in the fast dynamics\nrepresents the dividing surface between two different types of IWC. \n\n \nFigure \\ref{fig:unstableslip}(B) shows an example within class 142 in\nwhich there is the onset of some kind of micro-scale sprag-slip\noscillation. \nHere there is also an unstable \n$S_+S_+$ mode, again represented by a square. For the parameter values\ndepicted, every other contact mode is inconsistent and IWCs are\nnot possible either.  The initial condition for the trajectory\ndepicted is\n$\\tilde{y}_1=\\tilde{y}_2=\\dot{\\tilde{y}}_1=\\dot{\\tilde{y}}_2=0$.  The\ndynamics converges to an attractive limit cycle representing slipping\nmotion accompanied by fast micro-vibration, with repeated liftoff and\nimpact at the second contact point. In the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$ this would \ncorrespond to a strange kind of sprag-slip limit cycle, for which the \nperiod is infinitesimally small. \n\nPanels C and D of Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip} show representations of\nslipping rigid bodies possessing the values of matrix $B$ that correspond\nto the cases shown in panels A and B, respectively. \nThe bodies are under the influence of gravity, whose direction is\nrepresented by the solid arrow through the centres of mass (COM). \nThe orientation of the vector $b$ for each body, depends on the slip \nvelocity, with the case illustrated corresponding to this velocity being\nclose to zero. The shape and dimension of each body and its point of \ncontact are represented graphically by a circle that shows the \nradius of gyration centred at the COM, and two solid line sections \nterminating at the contact points. The orientations of the \ncontact surfaces are represented by bold lines with hatched fills. The\nvalues of the coefficient of friction is specified by a label at each contact. \n\n\\subsection{Stability of equilibria}\n\\label{sec:6.4}\n\nStability of equilibrium configurations of rigid-body systems\nwith multiple unilateral contacts is of particular practical\nimportance in robotics, where one needs to be able to demonstrate\nthat grasping manoeuvres are robust.  In this context Pang and Trinkle\n\\cite{Pang} proposed various characterisations of stable equilibrium\nconfigurations of systems with any number of contacts.  They refer to\na configuration as exhibiting the \\textit{weak stability property} if the\n$TT..T$ mode is consistent and the \\textit{strong stability property} if\n$TT..T$ mode is the only consistent contact mode which has $u=0$ for\nall contacts.  However, they did not explore the consequences of these\nnotions of ``stability'' from the point of view of dynamical systems\ntheory. Howard and Kumar \\cite{howard96}  demonstrated \nthat the\n\\textit{strong stability} property of Pang and Trinkle is not necessary for\nstability against small external forces (structural stability) \nfor the case of a planar rigid\nbody with any number of contacts. An extension of this result to\nmultibody systems was given in \\cite{Varkonyi15b}.\n\nWe found in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3.3} that reverse chattering can occur in \na system with a single contact, if $b<0$ and the effective restitution\ncoefficient $e>1$. We\nalso pointed out in Sec.~\\ref{sec:3.4} \nthe significance of avoiding reverse chatter in proving\nLyapunov stability of equilibria.\nThe case of multiple contacts is more complex because a sequence\nof impacts may include impacts at any of the contact points in regular\n(periodic) or irregular (chaotic) order. In some cases, simultaneous\nimpacts at multiple points are also to be expected.\n\nOr and Rimon \\cite{Or08b} were the first to point out that the key\nto understanding Lyapunov stability of equilibria with \nunilateral frictional point contacts is to understand the \npossibility of reverse chattering motion of the system. \nThey developed a sufficient condition for\nLyapunov stability of a planar rigid body with two point contacts\nin the case of a specific impact law. A different sufficient condition using a\nmore realistic impact law was developed by V\\'arkonyi \\cite{Varkonyi12}, \nwho also demonstrated that reverse chattering $e>1$ may occur even \nif impacts are\npurely inelastic, i.e.~if $r_e=0$. More recently, \nV\\'{a}rkonyi and Or found an almost exact\ncondition of stability for planar bodies with two contacts and $r_e=0$, \nthe details of which will appear elsewhere \n\\cite{Varkonyi-Or_unp}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{instability.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{(Adapted from \\cite{Varkonyi12}). Simulation of the response of \na heavy planar rigid body to a small perturbation of \nits equilibrium configuration on a perfectly inelastic ($r_e=0$) \nslope. See text for details.\n\\label{fig:instability}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:instability} presents simulation results for a \nspecific example of heavy planar\nrigid body with two contact points that satisfies the strong stability property of \\cite{Pang}, \nyet is not stable in the sense of Lyapunov. \nThe shape of the body is represented by a circle and two lines \nas in Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip}, and for this simulation $r_e=0$.  \nInitially, the object is resting on a slope of angle $10^\\circ$, under\nthe influence of gravity. In this case, a static equilibrium equilibrium\nin $TT$ mode can be shown to be consistent (calculation omitted). \nNevertheless an infinitesimally small state-perturbation \nmay set the object into divergent motion, causing it to tumble down\nthe slope as illustrated. First we find accelerating slip\nmotion on leg 1, in mode $S_+F$.  This is followed by a sticking impact at leg\n2 followed by a rolling motion of that leg (i.e.~mode $FT$). This\nmode continues until leg 1 hits the ground again. \nThese four steps of motion are repeated again and again, while\nthe velocity of the object increases exponentially. The trajectories\nof the two contact points and the COM are shown by solid, dashed, and\ndotted curves, respectively in the figure. For more details, see\n\\cite{Varkonyi12}. \nIt is interesting to note that if we had taken a lower coefficient of\nfriction at leg 1, specifically if $\\mu_1<0.1$, then the initial equilibrium \nwould become ambiguous. Thus at time $t=0$ there would be an additional\npossibility for the motion, namely the behaviour displayed in the right-hand \npanels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:ambiguity}.\n\nIf nothing else, this example illustrates that these considerations\nof stability with multiple points of contact are not merely \nof academic interest, but can \nbe easily manifest in purely passive mechanical systems. Another recent\npractical illustration can be found in the work of Gamos and Or \n\\cite{GamosOr}. There they compute many details of the dynamics of\nbi-pedal passive walkers that can undergo stick-slip transitions,\nincluding several cases of multi-stability with complex \nbasins of attraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Single-point-of-contact case in 3D}\n\\label{sec:7}\n\nEverything discussed so has been for systems whose contact forces and\nmotions line in a plane. Much less is known\nabout the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox in situations that require a fully\nthree-dimensional analysis. For simplicity, we \nrestrict attention to the single contact case.   \nOur goal is to highlight similarities with and differences from \nthe planar case. In what follows we make some general observations, but\nonly do precise calculations in the case of the three-dimensional analogue\nof the CPP.\n\n\\subsection{Conditions for {Painlev\\'{e} } paradoxes to occur}\n\nFor any spatial system with a single contact, equations of motion analogous to \n\\eqref{eq:udynamics} and \\eqref{eq:vdynamics} can be derived:\n\n", "index": 91, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\dot{u}& = a (q,\\dot{q},t) + A(q,t) \\lambda_{T}\n+\\lambda_{N} B( q,t ) ,  \\label{eq:udynamics_3D} \\\\\n\\dot{v}& =b ( q,\\dot{q},t ) +B^T( q,t ) \\lambda_{T}\n+\\lambda_{N} C( q,t) ,  \\label{eq:vdynamics_3D}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E32.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\dot{u}\" display=\"inline\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>u</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E32.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=a(q,\\dot{q},t)+A(q,t)\\lambda_{T}+\\lambda_{N}B(q,t),\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo>,</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>q</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>T</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E33.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\dot{v}\" display=\"inline\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E33.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=b(q,\\dot{q},t)+B^{T}(q,t)\\lambda_{T}+\\lambda_{N}C(q,t),\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo>,</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>q</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mi>B</mi><mi>T</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>T</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03545.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\phi$ is the angle of $u$ relative \nto the positive $x_1$ axis,\nas in Fig.~\\ref{fig:3Drod}.

Our conclusion is confirmed by numerical\nsimulation (Fig.~\\ref{fig:3Drod}, right panel). What happens beyond\nthis crossing is an open question.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:8}\n\nThis article represents an attempt to survey the state of knowledge on\nthe range complex phenomena in rigid body mechanics \nthat have been grouped together under the\nepithet of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox. We have drawn particular attention to recent\nresults by the authors and their collaborators, while trying to establish some\ngeneral notation and terminology that we hope will help to organise the \nprevious literature and stimulate other researchers to investigate this\nfascinating topic. Let us close with some philosophical\nremarks and a brief summary of open problems. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Philosophical remarks}\n\nFar from being resolved, the Painlev\\'{e} paradox on the inconsistency of\nrigid body mechanics with frictional contact, first posed over 120 years ago, \nwould seem to retain many open facets. Even for the highly restrictive \nsituation of a planar configuration with a single point contact, we\nhave argued that there remain situations that are undecidable within\nthe framework of rigid body mechanics. In particular, slender bodies\nsuch as the classical {Painlev\\'{e} } problem of the falling rod reach a point\nof dynamic jam, from which it is not currently clear whether there is\na unique forward continuation without including additional physics. \nIn three dimensions, we have shown that\nthings are even worse, because the rod can enter the unstable {Painlev\\'{e} }\nregion transversely. Here, the results in Table \\ref{tab:summary2}\nsuggest there is indeterminacy because the rod could lift-off or take\nan impact. Also, even outside the {Painlev\\'{e} } region, we argued in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:5} that reverse chatter can be\ntriggered at a transition into stick.  If reverse chatter occurs then\nthere is infinite degeneracy between a continuum of different\nphases. Nevertheless, for the single contact case in 2D we showed that\ninclusion of an impact law and an analysis using contact regularisation\nenables resolution of all inconsistent cases, but indeterminacy remains.\n\nIf one allows more than one contact point, then we indicated in \nSec.~\\ref{sec:6} that\nthere are many other cases of indeterminacy, and we have not yet been able\nto resolve all possible cases of inconsistency, even under the\nsimplifying assumption that no contact is in stick.  \nWe have also provided evidence, for\nexample through the micro-scale chatter-like behaviour of Fig.~\\ref{fig:unstableslip}, that there may be far more complex\npossibilities for reverse or forward chatter-like behaviours \nin the case of two or more contacts. \n\nOne thing that our analysis does point to though is the insufficiency\nof Kilmister's principle applied to rigid bodies with multiple\ncontacts. That has led to a common approach in multibody mechanics to\nseek sufficient conditions under which there is a unique consistent\ncontact mode, thus avoiding any {Painlev\\'{e} } paradoxes.  \nWe argue that this approach is misguided, because we already\nknow from the single point of contact case that there are easily\nreachable configurations that are inevitably undecidable and which\ncannot be resolved without breaking the assumptions of rigid body\nmechanics.  We also showed a specific case in Sec.~\\ref{sec:6} where\nthere is a unique consistent contact mode $S_+ S_+$, but this is not\nnormally stable and instead an IWC must occur. Rather than seek\nsufficient conditions to sweep the paradox under the carpet, as it\nwere, we have been motivated instead by the three separate questions\nposed in the Introduction. In particular we have attempted to separate\nthe questions of: which configurations are consistent or determinate;\nhow one may undergo a transition into an indeterminate state; and\nwhether questions of consistency or indeterminacy can be resolved by\nconsideration of impact and contact regularisation.\n\nContact regularisation concerns the introduction of finite\nstiffnesses and in Sec.~\\ref{sec:4} we considered only the simplest\nkind, namely introduction of a stiffness in the normal degree of freedom. \n In one sense such normal regularisation can resolve all of the\nconsequences of the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradoxes, if one allows the stiffness to\nremain finite.  Even in this case though, simple nonsmooth friction\nlaws in the tangent direction lead to Filippov systems which can\nthemselves exhibit indeterminacy; see \\cite{Jeffrey} for a mechanical\nexample.  The test we have used for genuine determinacy associated\nwith the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is what we have termed {\\em uniform resolvability},\nnamely that normal contact regularisation leads to unique limiting\nbehaviour in the infinite stiffness limit. If such a unique limit does\nnot occur, such as in reverse chatter, then these cases we deem to be\ngenuinely indeterminate. Of course, there are many other possible\napproaches to regularisation, and we mentioned already the approach\nof Szalai \\cite{Szalai1,Szalai2} that appears promising. \n\nWe should also stress the fundamental point made in the Introduction that\nthe {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is not about the real world, but an indication of\nthe failure of rigid-body mechanics.\nTypically any friction or impact law is a gross approximation to\ntribological processes that occur at the microscale.\nThus, the existence of undecidability (either inconsistency or\nindeterminacy) within a rigid body framework points to situations for\nwhich there will be extreme sensitivity with respect to initial\nconditions in the real mechanics.  \n\n\nAn overarching conclusion then is that, for certain configurations at\nleast, a purely rational mechanics approach to rigid body dynamics\nwith impact and friction is fundamentally ill-posed.  To put it\nsomewhat pejoratively, one might say that \\textit{there is nothing\n  ``rational'' about rational mechanics} at least for rigid bodies.\nThere is a strong tradition going back to Newton, Euler and many\nothers in trying to discover the ``laws of mechanics'' and showing\nthat they are consistent. This body of literature has become known as\nrational mechanics; and indeed the \\textit{Archives for Rational\n  Mechanics and Analysis} is one of the most prestigious scientific\njournals. The hope is that one day, by posing sufficiently many\nconstitutive laws one can come up with self-consistent continuum\ntheories for fluids, elastic solids, elasto-plastic materials, etc.\nOne of the simplest such continuum theories is that of rigid body\nmechanics, which we typically teach to our students through an\naxiomatic approach. We talk about the Coulomb or Stribeck\n\\textit{laws} of friction, rather than models of friction.\nNevertheless we have shown that with even the simplest consistent\nfriction and impact laws for contact with friction lead to\nfundamentally undecidable cases, and the search for a grand unifying\nlaw that resolves all cases is probably futile.\n\nRather like Russell \\& Whitehead's attempt in \\textit{Principia\n  Mathematica} \\cite{Russell} to systematise arithmetic and, by\nimplication, the whole of mathematics (see, for example\n\\cite{Hofstadter} for a popular account), we could argue that any\nmission with the aim rationalising rigid body mechanics through axioms\nand laws is doomed to failure.  Rather like the way G\\\"{o}del's\nIncompleteness Theorem \\cite{Godel} showed the impossibility of\nRussell and Whithead's goal, in our view, the inconsistency and\nindeterminacy that is inherent in the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox suggests that a\ncomplete, self-consistent, theory of rigid body mechanics is\nimpossible. It is also tempting to draw the analogy between\nG\\\"{o}del's use of paradox at the heart of his proof. If G\\\"{o}del's\nwork has taught us anything it is that no mathematical theory of\nsufficient complexity to describe the real work is ever complete;\nundecidability paradoxes are inevitable.\n\n\\subsection{Open problems and perspectives}\n\nIn Sec.~\\ref{sec:2.3} we reviewed some of the configurations that have\nbeen shown to exhibit {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox phenomena. Many of the practical\nimplications of the theory to these and related mechanisms remain\nunexplored. For example, is it possible to explain the transition to\nsprag-slip oscillation in brake-disc-like systems through a reverse\nchatter instability?  Can such instabilities be used to explain the\nmechanism for drawing dashed lines on a blackboard?  Another practical\narea which seems largely unexplored is in rotor machinery with\ncontact, where there are large couplings between tangential and normal\nmotion due to gyroscopic forces. Even ignoring possible sprag-slip\nbehaviour, rotordyanmics with contact can lead to rich dynamics, see\ne.g.~\\cite{Zilli} and references therein.\n\nWith two or more contacts we have pointed in Sec.~\\ref{sec:6} to many\nnew phenomena, including IWCs that can involve one or more contacts\nand possible micro-chatter.  To use a deliberate pun, we have {\\em\n  only just scratched the surface} for planar bodies with two contacts\nand there are many cases that remain unexplored. In three\ndimensions, and for more than two contact points, the conditions that\nlead to reverse chatter remain completely unexplored. Elucidating when\nreverse chatter can occur is an important question for applications,\nfor example in the design of grippers and manipulators in robotics.\nWe we have shown, the question of which mode of motion is observed\ncannot be solved simply by looking at which modes are\nfeasible. Instead, we need to consider Lyapunov stability, which, using\nthe method of contact regularisation, can lead to an understanding of\nwhere IWC and/or reverse chatter is either possible or inevitable.\n\nWe also pointed to recent work \\cite{GamosOr} that analyse how {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparadoxes can occur in simple models of legged locomotion. There is a\ngrowing body of work in biomechanics that uses ideas from dynamical\nsystems and bifurcation theory to understand human gate stability,\nsince the pioneering work of Alexander \\cite{Alexander}, see\ne.g.~\\cite{Seyfarth} and references therein for recent results.  As\nyet though, the complexities associated with the {Painlev\\'{e} }\nparadox seems largely unexplored in that literature.\n\nAnother practical question is if the extreme sensitivity associated\nwith the {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox is unavoidable, how can we design\ncontrol laws to ameliorate its effects? The state of the art in\ncontrol of such systems seems to be to use the framework of\ncomplementarity or hybrid systems, see for example the work of Heemels\nand co-workers \\cite{Heemels}.  However, as we have shown, a complete\nunderstanding of the dynamics requires consideration of contact\nregularisation and impact, which go beyond the complementarity\nview.\n\nThere are many theoretical questions that remain yet to be analysed to\ndetermine consistency and stability.  As far as we are aware the\nsimplest cases yet to be analysed are situations where there are two sticking\ncontacts in 2D, or where there is just one sticking contact in 3D.  In\ngeneral we are long way from a complete list of types of dynamical\nbehaviour, and it is not yet known whether and how the non-existence\nparadox can be resolved in all cases.  Also, characterisation of\nbifurcations and transitions in multi-contact systems remains\ncompletely unexplored. Implications of {Painlev\\'{e} } paradoxes for the much\nmore tricky situations of line or regional contact seem to remain a\nlong way off. Even seemingly simple questions for planar single\ncontact systems remain unsolved, such as what happens beyond the\n$G$-spot, and whether it is ever possible to cross\ninto $p<0$ other than at this point for systems that have more than\nthree-degrees of freedom. \n\nIn summary, far from being resolved, there seems to be a rich array of\nopen questions, both theoretical and practical, that arise from the\nindeterminacy, multistability and instability associated with the\nclassical {Painlev\\'{e} } paradox. If nothing else we hope this survey will\nserve to stimulate fresh efforts by the next generation of\nresearchers. It would seem to us that there could easily be room for\nanother 120 years of fruitful research on these fascinating phenomena.\n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plain}\n\\bibliography{painleve}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 144122, "prevtext": "\nin which all terms are $O(1)$ except for the acceleration-like term\n$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[ \\cos\\phi \\quad \\sin\\phi \\right]$, which is\n$O(\\lambda_N)$.
