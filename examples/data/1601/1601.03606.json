Such systems could be especially interesting\nin the recollision regime (in which emitted electrons recollide with\nthe tip in the course of the laser pulse) as this could allow to\ngenerate extremely short electron pulses~\\cite{Pau01} and thus pave\nthe way to sub-femtosecond and sub-nanometric probing of\nmatter~\\cite{Ago04}. Most studies have up to now focused on metallic\nnanotips. In particular, laser-induced photo-emission of electrons in\nthe recollision regime, manifesting itself in the formation of a\nplateau at high kinetic energies in the photo-electron spectrum (PES),\nhas been very recently observed in tungsten tips of na\\-no\\-me\\-tric\nsize~\\cite{Bor10,Sch10,Kru12b}.  In this context, carbon nanotubes\nhave also been proposed as promising emitting devices, since they\npossess an even smaller tip size than the metal tips used so\nfar~\\cite{Car97}. These novel structures have mainly been\ncharacterized by field emission experiments~\\cite{Sat97,Nil00}. Due to\nthis smaller tip size of carbon nanotubes, these systems might thus\nlead to even more promising sources for sub-femtosecond /\nsub-nanometric probing of dynamic processes in various areas of\nphysics, chemistry, biochemistry or material science. Only very\nrecently, laser-assisted photo-electron studies, which have been very\nsuccessful in the case of metal nanotips, have been extended to these\nnovel tips based on carbon nanostructures~\\cite{Bio14}.\n\n\nIn relation to this question of field emission from carbon nanotips,\nthe present work aims at studying to which extent photo-emission by\nultrafast laser pulses can reach the intended recollision regime in\ncarbon nanostructures. As a starting point, we shall focus our\nanalysis on the actual extremity of the tip which practically consists\nin the cap of a nanotube (the tip is formed by rolling graphene sheets\nwith various radii and helical structures). The cap\nof the carbon nanotubes used in the above mentioned photo-emission\nexperiments are similar in size and structure to a ${\\text{C}_{60}}$\ncluster~\\cite{Sai92}. In this first step we shall thus use ${\\text{C}_{60}}$\nas a test model for the exploratory studies presented here. We\nconsider the response of ${\\text{C}_{60}}$ subject to an intense laser\nirradiation and characterize this response in terms of photo-electron\nspectra (PES).\n\n The paper is outlined as follows:\nSection~\\ref{sec:frame} briefly introduces the theoretical framework\nand computational details. Section~\\ref{sec:results} presents and\ndiscusses the results. Section~\\ref{sec:conclusion} completes the\npaper with a conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Formal framework}\n\\label{sec:frame}\n\n\\subsection{Time-dependent local-density approximation}\n\\label{sec:tdks}\n\nWe describe electron dynamics by means of time-dependent density-functional theory at the\nlevel of the time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA). \nThe LDA is complemented by an average-density self-interaction\ncorrection (SIC), which has been shown to provide a reliable \ntheoretical framework of electron dynamics in strong laser fields, \nin particular when the excitation leads to substantial ionization\n~\\cite{Kaw09,Fen10}. \nThe detailed theoretical approach is given elsewhere, and\nshall only \nbriefly be summarized here. \nThe time-dependent single-particle (s.p.)\nwave functions $\\varphi_{j}(\\textbf{r},t)$ are obtained by solving the\ntime-dependent Kohn-Sham equations~\\cite{Run84} (here and in the\n  following we use atomic units)~:\n\\begin{subequations}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:tdks}\n \\mathrm{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\varphi_{j}(\\textbf{r},t) \n &=&\n \\{-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^{2}+\\upsilon_\\mathrm{C}[\\rho(\\textbf{r},t)]\n\\cr\n &&  \\quad+\\ \\upsilon_\\mathrm{xc}[\\rho(\\textbf{r},t)]\n  +\\upsilon_\\mathrm{ext}(\\textbf{r},t)\\} \\varphi_{j}(\\textbf{r},t),\n\\\\\n \\upsilon_\\mathrm{ext}\n &=&\n \\upsilon_\\mathrm{jel}+\\upsilon_\\mathrm{las},\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{subequations}\nwhere $\\upsilon_\\mathrm{C}$ is the standard Coulomb potential and\n$\\upsilon_\\mathrm{xc}$ the exchange-correlation potential from DFT \\cite{Dre90} using the\nexchange-functional given in~\\cite{Per92}.  \nThis potential depends on the actual\nelectron density\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\rho(\\textbf{r},t)=\\sum^{N_{\\rm el}}_{j=1}|\\varphi_{j}(\\textbf{r},t)|^{2}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $N_{\\rm el}$ is the number of electrons.  The external one-body\npotential $\\upsilon_{\\rm ext}$ is composed from the potential of the ionic\nbackground potential, here modeled as a jellium (see section\n\\ref{sec:jellium}), and the potential of the laser field (see section\n\\ref{sec:las}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Ionic background}\n\\label{sec:jellium} \n \nThe positively charged ionic background is approximated by a jellium\nmodel.  Specifically for ${\\text{C}_{60}}$ considered here, all carbon ions\nare arranged into a shell-like structure~\\cite{Kro85}. \nThe model for the jellium\npotential $\\upsilon_\\mathrm{jel}$ for the ionic background reads~:\n\\begin{subequations}\n\\label{eq:psrho}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\upsilon_\\mathrm{jel} (\\mathbf r)\n  &=&\n  -\\int \\textrm d^{3} \\mathbf r'\n  \\frac{ \\rho_\\mathrm{jel}(|\\textbf{r}'|) } {|\\textbf{r}-\\textbf{r}'|}\n  +\n  \\upsilon_\\mathrm{ps}(|\\mathbf r|)\n  \\;,\n\\label{eq:vjel}\n\\\\\n  \\rho_\\mathrm{jel} (r)\n  &=&\n  \\rho_0 \\,g(r)\n  \\;,\n\\label{eq:pspot}\n\\\\\n \\upsilon_\\mathrm{ps} (r)\n  &=&\n  \\upsilon_0 \\, g(r)\n  \\;,\n\\label{eq:WS}\n\\\\\n   g(r)\n   &=&\n   \\frac{1}{ 1+\\exp\\left[(r\\!-\\! R_-)/\\sigma\\right] }\\,\n   \\frac{1}{ 1+\\exp\\left[(R_+\\!-\\!r)/\\sigma \\right] }\n   \\;,\n\\label{eq:gfunc}\n\\\\\n   R_\\pm\n    &=&\n    R\\pm\\frac{\\Delta R}{2}\n    \\;.\n\\label{eq:Rpm}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{subequations}     \nThe jellium density $\\rho_\\mathrm{jel}$ is modeled by a sphere of\npositive charge with a void at the center \\cite{Pus93,Bau01,Cor03}.\nThe Woods-Saxon profile $g$ generates a transition from bulk shell to\nthe vacuum (inside and outside), providing soft surfaces.  \nFurthermore, we employ a pseudo-potential\n$\\upsilon_\\mathrm{ps}$\n in addition to the potential created by the\njellium density, as proposed in Ref.~\\cite{Rei13}, which is tuned to\nensure reasonable values of the single-particle energies.  The average\nradius $R$ of the jellium cage is taken from experimental data as\n$R=6.7~{\\mathrm{a}_0}$~\\cite{Hed91}.  The thickness of the jellium shell\n$\\Delta R$, the surface softness $\\sigma$, and the depth of the\npotential well $\\upsilon_0$ are adjustable parameters for which we use\nhere $\\sigma=0.6~{\\mathrm{a}_0}$, $\\upsilon_0=1.9~\\mathrm{Ry}$, and $\\Delta R=\n2.57~{\\mathrm{a}_0}$. The bulk density $\\rho_0$ is determined such that\n$\\int\\textrm{d}^3\\mathbf{r}\\,\\rho_\\mathrm{jel}\n(\\mathbf{r})~=N_\\mathrm{el}=238$.\nNote that this number of electrons is different from 240 for a real\n${\\text{C}_{60}}$, but no jellium model is capable to \nplace the electronic shell closure at this value  so far\n(unless one uses a deliberate modification of the occupation numbers\n\\cite{Mad08}). \nMost jellium models for ${\\text{C}_{60}}$ have the shell\nclosure at $N_\\mathrm{el}=250$ \\cite{Pus93,Bau01,Cor03}. The present\nmodel with soft surfaces comes to $N_\\mathrm{el}=238$ which is much\ncloser to reality. By virtue of the choice of model parameters, \nthe electronic properties of ${\\text{C}_{60}}$ are well reproduced, \nin particular the \nionization potential (IP) at $E_\\mathrm{IP}=0.56$ Ry, that is identical to the\nexperimental value~\\cite{Lic91b}, a HOMO-LUMO gap of 0.14 Ry, which \nis well within\nthe range of the experimental values \n(0.12-0.15~Ry~\\cite{Sat10}), as well as a good \ndescription of the photo-absorption\nspectrum (for details, see~\\cite{Rei13}).\n\nThe use of the jellium approximation, nevertheless, \nrequires some words of\ncaution. The standard procedure is to use a detailed ionic\nbackground coupled to the electrons through pseudo-potentials.\nThere exist numerous investigations for\n${\\text{C}_{60}}$~\\cite{Kor10,Tof10} and other carbon nanostructures\nsuch as graphene~\\cite{Ara04} or nanotubes~\\cite{Dri11}.  An\nelaborate description of ${\\text{C}_{60}}$ with an involved orientation\naveraging is needed for\ndetailed observables such as photo-electron spectra (PES) \nand photo-angular distributions (PAD) \\cite{Wop15,Gao15,Wop15b}. \nA key issue in the\npresent investigations is the ponderomotive motion of the\nelectron in the laser field associated with huge excursions of the\nelectron~\\cite{Her12}.  This requires extremely large simulation\nboxes which become unaffordable for a grid representation in full\n3D. The jellium model, together with the linearly polarized laser\nfield, has cylindrical symmetry. This allows us to use a\ncylindrical (2 dimensional) box which renders the necessary\nhuge boxes\nfeasible. As an additional benefit, we can also compute \nangular distributions\nwithout the extra expense of orientation\naveraging \\cite{Wop10a,Wop10b}. As far as the jellium model \nis concerned, \nit is a powerful\napproximation as it provides an appropriate description of many\nfeatures of the electronic structure and dynamics in solids\n\\cite{Ash76}, cluster physics \\cite{Eka84,Bra93}, and ${\\text{C}_{60}}$\n\\cite{Bau01}.  However, two aspects have been\nsacrificed.  The first one is that the returning electron\ncollides with the jellium well instead of with a carbon\nion. Although the potential of the ionic background is very \nsteep, we are probably underestimating the actual yield of\nhigh-energy electrons. The second\naspect is that we ignore ionic motion. \nAs a consequence, we miss effects from phonon \ncoupling~\\cite{Gun95a} as well\nas from electronic dissipation \\cite{Rei15a}.\nHowever, since we are using femtosecond laser pulses, \ntheir effect should not drastically affect the main findings \npresented here. \n\n\n\\subsection{Laser field}\n\\label{sec:las}\n\nThe laser field is taken to be linearly polarized \nalong the $z$ direction, with a sin$^2$-shaped envelope,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\mathbf E_\\mathrm{las} (t) \n  =\n  E_0\\sin^2 \\left(\\pi t/{T_\\text{pulse}}\\right)\\sin({\\omega_\\text{las}} t+\\phi_\\mathrm{CEP})\\,\\mathbf{e}_z\n  \\;.\n\\label{eq:laser}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{las}}(t)=E_{0}\\sin^{2}\\left(\\pi t/{T_{\\text}{pulse}}\\right%&#10;)\\sin({\\omega_{\\text}{las}}t+\\phi_{\\mathrm{CEP}})\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z}\\;.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc04</mi><mi>las</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\text</mtext></merror></msub></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\text</mtext></merror></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>CEP</mi></msub></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><msub><mi>\ud835\udc1e</mi><mi>z</mi></msub></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03606.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis quantity gives an indication on the charge state of\n${\\text{C}_{60}}$ after irradiation~\\cite{Fen10}.

For the highest laser intensity\n(right column of Fig.~\\ref{fig:velo}), a sizable backflow of the\ncurrent density occurs during pulse duration, especially between 5 and\n15 fs, where the field amplitude is maximal. For instance, in the time\ninterval indicated by the two vertical dashed lines, the majority of\nelectrons possess a negative $j_z$ (they are thus pulled away from the\n${\\text{C}_{60}}$), while a non-negligible amount exhibits a positive $j_z$,\nwhich means that they are pulled back towards ${\\text{C}_{60}}$ and that\nrecollision is possible. At the lowest $I_\\mathrm{las}$, this\nbackflow still exists but is much weaker, see inset in the bottom\nleft panel for which the current density scale has been divided by 100\nto allow the visualization of this weak counterflow.  The\n  amplitude of this quiver motion can be estimated from a purely\n  classical model as $l_\\mathrm{q}=\\alpha E_0/\\omega^{2}$ where\n  $\\alpha$ is the field enhancement factor (here about 1.05).

These classical\n  $l_\\mathrm{q}$ agree well with the amplitudes one can read\n  off from the current density maps. The large ponderomotive oscillations terminate as soon as the external\nfield dies out.  The further evolution still shows a succession of\npositive and negative fringes of $j_z$, but electrons in the $z>0$ and\nthe $z<0$ regions do not oscillate in phase anymore.  This is\nparticularly visible for the highest $I_\\mathrm{las}$ above 20~fs.\n\n\\subsection{Time-resolved analysis}\n\\label{sec:timeanaly}\n\nAs mentioned above, \nin addition to the high-energy cut-off, we see modulations of the PES\nwithin the broad plateau for the two cases with the higher intensities\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:PES_Intens}. Similar structures \nhave been experimentally observed in the photoemission spectra of rare gases (i.e., argon\natom~\\cite{PauG01}) ionized by strong infrared laser\npulses. These structures have been interpreted as \ninterference effects from several electron trajectories {\\color{black} {generated either in the same optical cycle or in the subsequent optical cycle}}, leading to the same final states ~\\cite{Lew94}. \nIn particular, in this work, two types of trajectories \nhave been identified, labeled as ``short\\rq{}\\rq{} and ``long\\rq{}\\rq{}\ntrajectories, due to their different excursion times.\nWithin the three-step model, the electrons are \nborn close to the field maxima, where the tunnel ionization probability is maximal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\color{black} {Since we {\\color{black} {focus on}} electron emission in the forward direction,  we have chosen, for the time-resolved analysis, {\\color{black} {instants based on a classical picture of the electron emission.

The first one is  the ``return'' time for the electron to recollide with the target and is about $0.75t_\\mathrm{oc}$. The second one is the time for electrons emitted from the rescattering site to travel to the detection points $R_{b}=90~\\mathrm{a}_{\\rm 0}$ near the boundary of the simulation box. This ``traveling'' time is $(R_{b}-R)$/$\\sqrt{2E_\\mathrm{kin}}$}} for electrons recorded with kinetic energy $E_\\mathrm{kin}$. {\\color{black} {All in all, we have used~:}} \\begin{subequations} \\label{eq:tfin} \\begin{eqnarray} t_f&\\approx& t_{b}+\\Delta t,\\\\ \\Delta t&=&0.75t_\\mathrm{oc}+(R_{b}-R)/\\sqrt{2E_\\mathrm{kin}}. \\end{eqnarray} \\end{subequations} {\\color{black} {For $t_{\\rm b1}$, we used $E_\\mathrm{kin}= 70$ eV leading to $\\Delta t=1.04~t_\\mathrm{oc}$, while for $t_{\\rm b2}$ and $t_{\\rm b3}$, we took $E_\\mathrm{kin}= 135$~eV and then obtained $\\Delta t=0.96~t_\\mathrm{oc}$. Plugging these numbers in Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:tfin}),  we got $t_{\\rm f1/2/3}=$~3.79, 4.71, and 5.71~$t_\\mathrm{oc}$ respectively, as symbolized in Fig.~\\ref{fig:e136TRPES}(b).}}  {\\color{black} {The bottom panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:e136TRPES} presents three different PES, note that each one has been analyzed from $t=0$ up to one of the ``final'' times introduced above.  \\begin{figure}[htbp]  \\centering  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{pes_e136_TRPES}  \\caption{\\label{fig:e136TRPES} Time-resolved analysis    of photo-emission from ${\\text{C}_{60}}$ irradiated by a laser pulse    polarized in the $z$ direction, with ${\\omega_\\text{las}}=1.36$~eV,     $T_{\\rm pulse}=24$~fs and     $I_\\mathrm{las}=1.6\\times{10}^{14}~{\\text{W}/\\text{cm}^2}$.

Indeed,\nat the field maximum {\\color{black} {indicated by $t_{\\rm b1}$}}, on the rising part of the pulse {\\color{black} {envelop}}, the \nfield strength is not yet sufficient for an efficient \ntunnel ionization. \nThe major part of the spectrum, containing the main structures, \nis obtained for the spectrum at $t_{\\rm f2}$, which corresponds {\\color{black} {to a birth time $t_{\\rm b2}$ at}}\nthe highest field value of the pulse. It shows a clear plateau, \nwith distinct modulations. If one interprets these structures \nas interferences from two electron trajectories, \nit would correspond to a relative phase \nof $\\delta S=E_\\mathrm{kin} \\delta t$~\\cite{Mil06} with $\\delta t$=0.41 fs, \nwell below the optical period $t_\\mathrm{oc}$= 3 fs.\nThis value of $\\delta t$, about one seventh of $t_{\\rm oc}$,\nis in the same order as deduced by an extended schematic model for recent laser-nanotip interactions, estimated to about \none sixth in this case~\\cite{Kru12a}.\nWithin this interpretation \nof interference of different electron trajectories, \nthe findings of the numerically calculated spectra\nat $t_{\\rm f2}$ would correspond to ``intracycle'' interferences, \ni.e., interference that stems from electron trajectories \noriginating during the same optical period. \nWhen comparing to the spectrum at $t_{\\rm f3}$, one sees that the \nadditional changes with respect to that at $t_{\\rm f2}$ \nare minor {\\color{black} {at the side of the extension of the plateau}}, however, one striking difference \ncan be observed: the appearance of high-frequency modulations \nin the spectra. These modulations correspond to peaks separated \nby the central frequency $\\omega_\\mathrm{las}$. \nFrom a temporal point of view, these structures are created by\ninterferences of electron trajectories that are born \nat times separated by the optical period, and can thus be \nidentified as ``intercycle'' interferences. These are commonly observed \nfor longer pulses, where several field peaks have comparable maxima, as it is in the present case.  \n\nWhen compared to the full spectra, \none sees slow convergence for the low-energy electrons. \nThis can be understood by the fact that these electrons, \ndue to their slower speed, only arrive at delays much larger \nthan $\\Delta t$. This systematic effect is clearly \nvisible in all time-resolved spectra.\n\nTo summarize, we have analyzed the time evolution of the spectra\nobtained by the fully numerical TDDFT calculations \nby choosing particular detection times to separate \nas fully as possible \nthe contributions from the different field maxima.\nWhile not claiming to have unambiguously identified the \nobserved structures, we have shown that their \ncharacteristics, both in their time evolution as well as \nwith respect to their\nfrequency fingerprints, are consistent with the \npicture of interfering intra- and intercycle trajectories. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nIn this paper, we have analyzed the electron dynamics of laser-excited\n${\\text{C}_{60}}$ as a model case for the generation of\nhigh-energy electrons from a carbon tip. We have explored the\nresponse of the system to laser fields of various intensities for\n  a frequency in the infrared domain which leads, at high intensities,\nto significant ponderomotive effects. To analyze such a complex\ndynamics, we go beyond single-active-electron approaches and use\ntime-dependent density-functional theory propagated in\nreal time and computed on a spatial grid. This approach allows, in\nparticular, a proper description of collective electronic motion as\nwell as a detailed analysis of photo-electron spectra (PES) and\n  photo-angular distributions (PAD).  One of the main numerical challenges in the\npresent investigation was the large box size required to account for\nthe huge pathway of the ponderomotive motion of the electrons.\nTo make that feasible in a quantum mechanical\nframework, we use a spherical jellium approximation for the ionic\nbackground and handle the dynamics on a cylindrical grid.\n \nAs a major result, \nwe have shown that the recollision regime can be reached for\nstrong, but realistic, laser intensities.  \nWe find the establishment\nof a plateau stretching out to\nvery high kinetic energies, e.g. to about 125 eV for $I=1.6 \\times10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$, which is interpreted\nusing the well-known recollision mechanism and \nillustrated by using a map of the time dependence of the\ncurrent distribution.  \nThe cut-off of the plateau is shown to follow the semiclassical \nmodel based on the three-step model, {\\color{black} {with a field which is enhanced by about $10 \\%$ in our simulations.}}\nA detailed time-resolved analysis of the PES\ndemonstrates how the high-energy plateau is generated successively\nduring the laser pulse.\nIn particular, we have shown that the observed structures and their \ntime evolution stemming from different peaks of the field are consistent \nwith the picture of intra- and intercycle interferences. \nAs far as the angular distribution is concerned, \none of the most promising results of the presented study is\nthe strong focusing of the electrons in the forward direction, \nespecially for the high energy electrons provided by the recollision process.   \nThis is an important feature in the context of using carbon nanotubes as future\nsources of collimated electron beams for time-resolved diffraction\nexperiments. \n\\newpage\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments:}\n\n\n\n\nC.-Z.G. thanks the financial support from China\nScholarship Council (CSC) (No.  [2013]3009).
