Example 3.15 of \\cite{chordal}, shows that not for all chordal clutters ${\\EuScript{C}}$, the ideal $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$\nhas linear quotients. Thus we focus on the question ``Are all clutters ${\\EuScript{C}}$ with $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ having linear\nquotients, chordal?''. Our first result shows that this question is equivalent to asking ``Do  all clutters ${\\EuScript{C}}$\nwith $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ having linear quotients, have an SSC?''\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{lin q closed under sc del}\nSuppose that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ has linear quotients and that $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Then $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ has linear quotients.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $I=I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$, $I'= I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ and suppose that $u_1, \\ldots, u_m$ is the linear quotient order  of the set\nof minimal generators of $I$, denoted by ${\\mathcal{G}}(I)$. Then ${\\mathcal{G}}(I')$ is the union of ${\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ and the set of squarefree\nmonomials $u$ of degree $d+1$ with $e{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{supp}}(u)=\\{i\\in [n]\\big| x_i|u\\}$. Denote the elements of ${\\mathcal{G}}(I'){\\setminus }\n{\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ by $u_{m+1}, \\ldots, u_t$. We show that $I'$ has linear quotients with respect to the order $u_1, \\ldots,\nu_t$. Set $F_i={\\mathrm{supp}}(u_i)$. By \\cite[Proposition 8.2.4]{hibi}, we have to show that for each $j<i\\leq t$, there\nare $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } F_i$ and $k<i$ such that $F_k{\\setminus } F_i=\\{l\\}$. If $i\\leq m$, this property holds since $u_1,\n\\ldots, u_m$ is an order of linear quotients. If $j\\geq m+1$, then as $e{\\subseteq} F_j\\cap F_i$, we have $|F_j{\\setminus } F_i|=1$\nand hence the required property again holds with $k=j$ and $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } F_i$.\n\nSo assume $j\\leq m< i$. Suppose that for each $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } e$, we have $el\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$. Then $F_j{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}[e]$ and since\n$e$ is simplicial, we should have $F_j\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ which means $u_j\\notin I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$, a contradiction. Therefore, there\nis a $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } e$ with $el\\notin{\\EuScript{C}}$. So $el\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and for some $k\\leq m$, we should have $el=F_k$.\nConsequently, this $k$ and $l$ satisfy the required property.\n\\end{proof}\n\nDue to the above result, we try to find some subclasses of ideals with linear quotients whose corresponding\nclutter has an SSC. One such class is the set of squarefree polymatroidal ideals. A monomial ideal $I$ is called\n\\emph{polymatroidal}, when all elements  of ${\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ have the same degree and if $u=x^{a_1} \\cdots x^{a_n}, v=\nx^{b_1} \\cdots x^{b_n} \\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ with $a_i>b_i$ for some $i$, then there is a $j$ with $a_j<b_j$ such that\n$x_ju/x_i\\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$. According to the symmetric exchange theorem (\\cite[Theorem 12.4.1]{hibi}), when $I$ is\npolymatroidal and $u,v,i$ are as above, then we can find a $j$ with $a_j<b_j$ and not only $x_ju/x_i\\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ but\nalso $x_iv/x_j\\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$. Also by \\cite[Theorem 12.6.2]{hibi}, polymatroidal ideals have linear quotients.\n\n\\begin{prop}\nSuppose that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is polymatroidal. Then ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nClearly we can assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Also if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is complete then by \\cite[Corollary 3.12]{chordal},\n${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal. Thus we assume that ${\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Obviously if ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is the complete $d$-clutter on $[n]$,\nthen ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is strongly connected. Thus as ${\\EuScript{C}} \\cup {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}={\\EuScript{C}}'$, we conclude that there is an $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\cap\n{\\mathcal{SC}}({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$. We show that $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\nAssume $A{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$, $A\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and $|A\\cap e|$ is maximum possible. If $|A\\cap e|=d$, then $A=ev$ for some\n$v\\in {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$, a contradiction. Suppose $|A\\cap e|<d$. Since $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$, there is a $F\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$\ncontaining $e$. Let $i\\in e{\\setminus } A$. Then by the  $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ being polymatroidal and by the symmetric exchange\ntheorem, we deduce that there exists a $j\\in A{\\setminus } F$ such that $A'= A{\\setminus } \\{j\\}\\cup \\{i\\}\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$. Note that\n$j\\notin e$, so $|A' \\cap e|> |A\\cap e|$ and also $A'{\\subseteq} A\\cup e{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$. This is against the choice of $A$.\nWe conclude that no such $A$ exists, that is, ${\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$ is a clique, as required.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe cannot deduce from this proposition that if $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is polymatroidal, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal, since\n$I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ may not be polymatroidal for any $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, as the following example shows.\n\\begin{ex}\nLet ${\\EuScript{C}}=\\{145, 245,345\\}$ on $[5]$. Then it is straightforward to check that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is polymatroidal. Note\nthat ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})=\\{ab|a=1,2,3, \\, b=4,5\\}$. Thus for every $e\\in{\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ is not polymatroidal.\nFor example if $e=14$, $F_1=145$ and $F_2=234$, then $F_1, F_2\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ and $1\\in F_1{\\setminus } F_2$ but there is no\n$j\\in F_2{\\setminus } F_1$ with $F_1{\\setminus } \\{1\\} \\cup\\{j\\}\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nAnother class of ideals with linear quotients are \\emph{squarefree stable ideals} [resp. \\emph{squarefree strongly\nstable ideals}], that is, squarefree monomial ideals such as $I$ with the property that for each squarefree\nmonomial $u\\in I$ and for each $j<m(u)$ [resp. $j<i$] with $x_j \\not| u$ [resp. $x_j \\not| u$ and $x_i|u$] one has\n$x_ju/x_{m(u)}\\in I$ [resp. $x_j u/x_i\\in I$] ($m(u)=$ the largest $i$ with $x_i|u$). Next we show that if\n$I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is squarefree stable, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has an SSC and even more, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{sq f sta}\nAssume that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is squarefree stable, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nClearly we can assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$. For each $1\\leq i\\leq d$, let $a_i$ be the minimum number $\\neq a_1,\n\\ldots, a_{i-1}$ in $[n]$, for which there is a $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ with $a_1, \\ldots, a_i\\in F$. Set $e=a_1\\cdots a_d$.\nObviously $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. We show that $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$ and $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ is squarefree stable. Then the result\nfollows by induction.\n\nSuppose that $F{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}[e]$, $F\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and $|F\\cap e|$ is maximum possible. By the way we chose $a_i$'s, we know\nthat for each $b\\in {\\mathrm{N}}[e]{\\setminus } e$, we have $b>a_d>\\cdots> a_1$, in particular, $m(x_F)\\notin e$. If $|F\\cap e|=d$,\nthen $F=eb$ for some $b\\in {\\mathrm{N}}[e]$, that is, $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ a contradiction. Thus we can assume that $|F\\cap e|<d$.\nHence $e{\\setminus } F\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Set $b'=\\min e{\\setminus } F$. Then as $x_F\\in I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ which is squarefree stable, we deduce\nthat $F'= F{\\setminus } \\{m(x_F)\\}\\cup \\{b'\\}\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$. Note that $F'\\cap e$ strictly contains $F\\cap e$ and by maximality\nof $|F\\cap e|$, we should have $F'\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$, a contradiction. From this contradiction we conclude that $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$\nand hence $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\nNext suppose that $F\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ with $b=m(x_F)$ and let $b'<b$ with $b'\\notin F$ and $F'=F{\\setminus } \\{b\\}\\cup\n\\{b'\\}$. We should prove that $F'\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$, to show that $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ is squarefree stable. If $F\\notin\n{\\EuScript{C}}$, then $F\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and it follows that $F'\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}{\\subseteq} {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$. If $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$, then we should have $e{\\subseteq}\nF$ and hence $b\\notin e$. Consequently, $e{\\subseteq} F'$ which results to $F'\\notin {\\EuScript{C}}-e$. Hence $F'\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ and\nthe result is concluded.\n\\end{proof}\n\nClearly each squarefree strongly stable ideal is squarefree stable and hence we can apply the previous result on\nsuch ideals, too. But indeed, we can say more on chordality of squarefree strongly stable ideals. To see this, we\nneed to recall another concept which generalizes chordal graphs. Let ${\\EuScript{D}}$ be a clutter on $[n]$ which is not\nnecessarily uniform (that is the ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is a family of incomparable subsets of $[n]$ which may have different\nsizes). For $v\\in [n]$ by ${\\EuScript{D}}/v$ (\\emph{contraction} on $v$) we mean the clutter of minimal elements of $\\{F{\\setminus }\n\\{v\\}|F\\in {\\EuScript{D}}\\}$. In \\cite{w-chordal}, a vertex $v$ of ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is called \\emph{simplicial}, when from $v\\in F_1,\nF_2\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ we can deduce that there is a $F_3\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ with $F_3{\\subseteq} (F_1\\cup {\\mathcal{F}}_2){\\setminus } \\{v\\}$. Moreover in\n\\cite{w-chordal},  Woodroofe calls ${\\EuScript{D}}$ chordal (here we call ${\\EuScript{D}}$ \\emph{W-chordal}), when every clutter arising\nfrom ${\\EuScript{D}}$ by a series of vertex deletions and contractions, contains a simplicial vertex.\n\n\\begin{prop}\nAssume that $I({\\EuScript{C}})$ is squarefree strongly stable. Then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is both chordal and W-chordal.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nMore generally, let ${\\EuScript{D}}$ be a (not necessarily uniform) clutter with $I({\\EuScript{D}})$ squarefree strongly stable. It is\neasy to show that for any $v\\in [n]$, $I({\\EuScript{D}}-v)$ is squarefree strongly stable. We first show that $I({\\EuScript{D}}/v)$ is\nalso strongly stable. Suppose that $F\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$, $i\\in F$, $j\\notin F$ and $j<i$. We should prove that there is a\n$F'\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$ with $F'{\\subseteq} F\\cup \\{j\\}{\\setminus } \\{i\\}$. If $F\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$, by $I({\\EuScript{D}})$ being squarefree strongly stable,\nthere is a $F''\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ satisfying this containment and so there is a $F'\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$ with $F'{\\subseteq} F''$ and we are\ndone. If $F\\notin {\\EuScript{D}}$, then $F\\cup\\{v\\}\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$, so there is a $F''\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ with $F''{\\subseteq} F\\cup \\{j,v\\}{\\setminus } \\{i\\}$.\nAgain there is a $F'\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$ with $F'{\\subseteq} F''{\\setminus }\\{v\\}$, as required.\n\nIt is easy to see that if $m$ is the maximum integer appearing in the union of all circuits of ${\\EuScript{D}}$, then $m$ is\na simplicial vertex. Thus ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is W-chordal. Furthermore, one could easily check that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{D}}}})$ is squarefree\nstrongly stable with respect to the reverse order on $[n]$. Consequently, if ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is also uniform, then by\n{(\\oldref{{sq f sta}})}, ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is chordal.\n\\end{proof}\nIt should be mentioned that in the above result, chordality of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ also follows its W-chordality, according to\n\\cite[Proposition 3.8]{chordal}.\n\n\n                                              \n\n\nNext we investigate, ideals with linear quotients which are the vertex cover ideal of some graph. Recall that the\n\\emph{vertex cover ideal} $I_G$ of a graph $G$ on $[n]$ is the ideal generated by all $x_C$'s where $C$ is a\nminimal vertex cover of $G$.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{ver cover ideal}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$ and $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})=I_G$ for a graph $G$ with the property that ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta({\\overline{G}}))$ is\nstrongly connected. Then ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $G$ is complete, then every $(n-1)$-subset of $[n]$ is a minimal vertex cover and it follows that ${\\EuScript{C}}={\\emptyset}$.\nThus $G$ is not complete. If $G$ has exactly one maximal independent set, then it easily follows that $E(G)={\\emptyset}$\nwhich means ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is complete and ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Thus we can assume that $G$ has at least two maximal\nindependent sets.  Note that as ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is assumed to be $d$-uniform, all minimal vertex covers and hence all\nmaximal independent sets of $G$ have the same size.\n\nSince facets of $\\Delta({\\overline{G}})$ are the maximal independent sets of $G$ and because ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta({\\overline{G}}))$ is strongly\nconnected, there exist two maximal independent sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ of $G$ with $|A_1\\cap A_2|=|A_1|-1= |A_2|-1$.\nSet $B=A_1\\cap A_2$ and suppose that $v_1\\in A_1{\\setminus } B, v_2 \\in A_2{\\setminus } B$. Consider $e=[n]{\\setminus } (A_1 \\cup A_2)$. Then\n$ev_1$ and $ev_2$ are minimal vertex covers of $G$. If $v\\in {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}}[e]{\\setminus } e$ and $v\\neq v_1, v_2$, then $ev$\nis a vertex cover of $G$ not containing any of $v_1,v_2$. Therefore, $v_1v_2$ is not an edge of $G$. On the other\nhand, since $A_1\\cup A_2$ is not an independent set and as $(A_1\\cup A_2 ){\\setminus } (A_1 \\cap A_2)=\\{v_1,v_2\\}$, we\nconclude that $v_1v_2$ is an edge. From this contradiction, it follows that ${\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}}[e]=ev_1v_2$.\n\nIf $ev_1v_2=[n]$, then $A_1\\cap A_2={\\emptyset}$ and hence maximal independent sets of $G$ are verieces, which means $G$\nis complete, against our assumption. Hence ${\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]\\neq {\\emptyset}$ and $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Let $A{\\subseteq} N_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$ and\n$|A|=d+1$. If $A\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$, then $A$ is a minimal vertex cover of $G$ and as $v_1v_2\\in E(G)$, one of $v_1$ and\n$v_2$, say $v_1$, is in $A$. But $v_1\\notin {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$, a contradiction. Thus $A\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ and $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{cor}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$, $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})=I_G$ for a graph $G$ and $I_G$ has a linear resolution (for example if\n$I_G$ has linear quotients). Then ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$.\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nSince $I_G=I(G)^\\vee=I_{\\Delta({\\overline{G}})^\\vee}$ has a linear resolution, it follows from the Eagon-Reiner theorem that\n$\\Delta({\\overline{G}})$ is a Cohen-Macaulay complex. Hence according to \\cite[Lemma 9.1.12]{hibi}, ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta({\\overline{G}}))$ is\nstrongly connected. Therefore, the result follows from {(\\oldref{{ver cover ideal}})}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nDespite the above result, we cannot deduce that in the situations of this result ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal, because as the\nfollowing results show, the class of vertex cover ideals is not closed under removing SSC's. A graph is said to be\n\\emph{unmixed}, when all of its minimal vertex covers have the same size.\n\\begin{prop}\\label{ver cov ideal = sc deleted}\nSuppose that $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$ and ${\\mathcal{G}}(I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})){\\subseteq} {\\mathcal{G}}(I_G)$ for an unmixed graph on $[n]$. Then $n=d+2$ and $G$\nis a complete graph. In particular, $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})= I_G$ for some graph $G$, {if and only if } $\\dim {\\EuScript{C}}=n-2$ and ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$\nis either a simplex or the union of two simplexes sharing an SC.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nNote that ${\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ contains all circuits which contain $e$, therefore each such subset of $[n]$ is a minimal\nvertex cover of $G$. Choose $v_1\\in [n]{\\setminus } e$. Then as $ev_1$ is a minimal vertex cover, there is an edge $v_1v_2$\nof $G$ with $v_2\\notin e$. Also each edge whose both ends are outside $e$, should have $v_1$ as one end and\nsimilarly $v_2$ as the other end. Thus $[n]=ev_1v_2$, and $n=d+2$. If $G$ is not complete, say $xy\\notin E(G)$ for\nsome $x,y\\in [n]$, then $G$ has a minimal vertex cover of size $<n-1$ contained in $[n]{\\setminus } xy$. This contradicts\nunmixedness of $G$, so $G$ is complete.\n\nFor the in particular case, first note that since ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is uniform, $G$ should be unmixed. Also because every\nnon-isolated vertex of a graph lies in a minimal vertex cover and by deleting isolated vertices of $G$, we can\nassume that $G$ has the same vertex set as ${\\EuScript{C}}$. Thus by the general part, we get $\\dim {\\EuScript{C}}=n-2$ and that\n${\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ is a complete $d$-clutter. But all circuits of ${\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ which does not contain $e$ are in ${\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$.\nIt follows that all circuits of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ contain $e$. Therefore, if $[n]{\\setminus } e=v_1v_2$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is either\n$\\{ev_1\\}$ or $\\{ev_2\\}$ or $\\{ev_1, ev_2\\}$, as required. The converse is clear.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{cor}\nSuppose that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})=I_G$ for some graph $G$ and $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Then $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}))\\neq I_{G'}$ for any graph\n$G'$.\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}))= I_{G'}$ for some graph $G'$, then by {(\\oldref{{ver cov ideal = sc deleted}})} and using the fact that\n$e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, it follows that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ should be a $(n-2)$-dimensional simplex, say ${\\EuScript{C}}=\\{ev_1\\}$ where $[n]{\\setminus }\ne=v_1v_2$. Thus $ev_2\\in I_G$ is a minimal vertex cover of $G$. So there is an edge in $G$ with one end $v_2$ and\nthe other end outside of $e$. As in the proof of the above result, we should have $V(G)=[n]$, thus $v_1v_2\\in\nE(G)$. From this it follows that $ev_1$ is also a minimal vertex cover of $G$, that is, $ev_1\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$, a\ncontradiction from which the result follows.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn \\cite[Lemma 3.11]{chordal}, it is proved that if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is the complete $d$-clutter on $[n]$ and $v\\in [n]$,\nthen there is a sequence $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_t$, such that $e_i\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}-e_1-\\cdots- e_{i-1})$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}- e_1-\n\\cdots- e_{t}= {\\EuScript{C}}-v$. They used this result, to prove that ``E-chordal'' clutters (another generalization of\nchordal graphs introduced by Emtander in \\cite{E-chordal}) are chordal. The final result of this section which\nprovides another proof of \\cite[Lemma 3.11]{chordal}, shows that there is an interesting relation between such\nsequences of SC's and orders of linear quotients of specific ideals. In this result by ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}'({\\EuScript{C}})$ we mean the\nset of SSC's of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and also those $d$-subsets of $[n]$ not contained in any circuit. Thus $N_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$ is  clique\nfor all $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}'({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{lin q and ssc seq}\nSuppose ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is the complete $d$-clutter on $[n]$, $v\\in [n]$ and $E=\\{e \\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})| v\\in e\\}$. Set $e'=e{\\setminus }\n\\{v\\}$ for each $e\\in E$. For a sequence $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_t$ of different elements in $E$ the following are\nequivalent:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\label{1} $e_i\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}'({\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1})$ for each $i\\in [t]$ where ${\\EuScript{C}}_{i}={\\EuScript{C}}-e_1-e_2-\\cdots-e_i$.\n\n\\item \\label{2} $x_{e'_1}, x_{e'_2}, \\ldots, x_{e'_t}$ is an order of linear quotients for $I={\\langle} x_{e'_1},\n    x_{e'_2}, \\ldots, x_{e'_t}  {\\rangle}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\n{(\\oldref{{1}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{2}})}: Suppose $j<i$. If $e_j{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$, then for $y\\in e_i{\\setminus } e_j$, we have\n$F=e_jy\\notin {\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}$ but  $F{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$, contradicting simpliciality of $e_i$. Thus there exists\nan $l\\in e_j{\\setminus } {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$.

First we prove that the facets of a\nvertex decomposable simplicial complex form a CF-tree which is chordal. Recall that a pure simplicial complex\n$\\Delta$ is called \\emph{vertex decomposable}, when whether it is a simplex or there is a $v\\in V(\\Delta)$ such\nthat both ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v$ and $\\Delta{\\setminus } v (=\\Delta|_{V{\\setminus }\\{v\\}})$ are both pure vertex decomposable. We call the\nvertex $v$ a \\emph{decomposing vertex}. This concept was first introduced in \\cite{provan} in connection with the\nHirsch conjecture which has applications in the analysis of the simplex method in linear programming and later was\nstudied by other authors, for example see \\cite{obs to shell, bal ver dec}. Note that 0-dimensional vertex\ndecomposable simplicial complexes are ${\\langle} \\{v\\} {\\rangle}$ for a vertex $v$.\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{1-dim vdec = tree}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a 1-dimensional uniform clutter (that is, a graph). Then $\\Delta= {\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ is vertex\ndecomposable {if and only if } ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a tree. Also if $\\Delta$ is not a simplex, then $v$ is a decomposing vertex {if and only if } it\nis a leaf.\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\n({$\\Leftarrow$}): If $|{\\EuScript{C}}|=1$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a simplex and vertex decomposable. Thus assume that $|{\\EuScript{C}}|>1$. Let $v$ be a\nleaf of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and $l$ the vertex adjacent to $v$. Then ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v={\\langle} \\{l\\} {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable and\nbecause ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is connected, $l$ is adjacent to a vertex $\\neq v$. So $\\{l\\}\\notin {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta{\\setminus } v)$, that is,\n$\\Delta{\\setminus } v$ is pure and ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)$ is a tree with fewer vertices. Hence the result follows by induction.\n\n({$\\Rightarrow$}): Let $v$ be a decomposing vertex of $\\Delta$. Since ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v$ is 0-dimensional vertex decomposable,\nwe see that $\\deg(v)=1$. Again since $\\Delta{\\setminus } v$ is vertex decomposable with fewer vertices, the claim follows\nby induction.\n\\end{proof}\n\nSuppose that $\\Delta={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ and $v\\in [n]$. It could be possible that ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\rangle} \\neq \\Delta{\\setminus } v$, for\nexample if ${\\EuScript{C}}=\\{12,34\\}$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}-1=\\{34\\}$ but ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)=\\{34, 2\\}$. But we have\n\\begin{lem}\\label{v-deletion}\nAssume that $\\Delta={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable and $v$ is a decomposing vertex. Then if ${\\EuScript{C}}-v\\neq\n{\\emptyset}$, we have ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\rangle} = \\Delta{\\setminus } v$.\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\nIt is clear that ${\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\subseteq} {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)$. Let $F\\in {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)$. Since ${\\emptyset}\\neq {\\EuScript{C}}-v{\\subseteq} {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta{\\setminus }\nv)$, and because $\\Delta{\\setminus } v$ is pure, we conclude that $\\dim F=d$. So $v\\notin F\\in {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)={\\EuScript{C}}$ and the\nclaim follows.\n\\end{proof}\n\nHere we call $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$ a \\emph{leaf}, when $\\deg(e)=1$.\n\\begin{thm}\\label{vdec has leaf}\nSuppose that $\\Delta= {\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable and not a simplex and $v$ is a decomposing vertex.

The case $d=1$ follows from {(\\oldref{{1-dim vdec = tree}})}. Assume that $d>1$.\nSet $\\Delta'= {\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta')$. If $\\Delta'$  is a simplex let $e'$ be any SSC of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$.\nElse let $e'$ be the SSC provided by the induction hypothesis. Using {(\\oldref{{v-deletion}})}, we see that in both cases,\n$e'$ is a leaf of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ and either ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}'-e' {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable or ${\\EuScript{C}}'-e'={\\emptyset}$.

If all hyperedges of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ have the same cardinality $d+1$, as we always assume in this\npaper, we call ${\\EuScript{C}}$ a \\emph{uniform $d$-dimensional clutter} (\\emph{$d$-clutter}, for short). In this case, the\nhyperedges of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ are called \\emph{circuits}. Also throughout this paper, $S=k[x_1,\\ldots, x_n]$, where $k$ is a\nfield and $x_F=\\prod_{i\\in F}x_i$, for $F{\\subseteq} [n]$. Moreover, $I({\\EuScript{C}})$ denotes the \\emph{circuit ideal} of ${\\EuScript{C}}=\n{\\langle} x_F|F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}{\\rangle}$ and ${\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}}$ is the $d$-\\emph{complement} of ${\\EuScript{C}}$, which means the family of all\n$(d+1)$-subsets of $[n]$ not in ${\\EuScript{C}}$.\n\nWe call $d$-subsets of circuits of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ \\emph{submaximal circuits (SC)} and denote the set of all submaximal\ncircuits by ${\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. By degree of a submaximal circuit $e$, we mean the number of circuits of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ containing\n$e$ and denote it by $\\deg(e)$. For $L{\\subseteq} [n]$, we write ${\\EuScript{C}}-L$ for the subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ consisting of those\ncircuits which do not contain $L$. For the sake of simplicity, we write for example $abc$ for the subset\n$\\{a,b,c\\}$ of $[n]$ or $ev$ for $e\\cup \\{v\\}$ where $e{\\subseteq} [n]$ and $v\\in [n]$.\n\nA well-known theorem of Fr\\\"oberg says that in the case $d=1$ (that is, when ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a graph), $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}})$ has a\nlinear resolution {if and only if } ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a chordal graph (see \\cite{Froberg}). Recently many authors have tried to\ngeneralize the concept of chordal graphs to clutters of arbitrary dimension in a way that Fr\\\"oberg's theorem\nremains true for $d>1$, see for example \\cite{E-chordal,vv-chordal, chordal,w-chordal,CF1}. A key part of this\ngeneralization is how to define cycles in arbitrary clutters.\n\nOne such generalization is given and studied by Connon and Faridi in \\cite{CF2, CF1}. They say that ${\\emptyset} \\neq\n{\\EuScript{C}}$ is a $d$-dimensional cycle (which we call a \\emph{$d$-dimensional CF-cycle}), when ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is \\emph{strongly\nconnected} (that is, for each $F_1, F_2\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$, there is a sequence of circuits starting with $F_1$ and ending\nwith $F_2$ such that consecutive circuits share a common SC) and $\\deg(e)$ is even for each $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Also\nby a \\textit{$d$-dimensional CF-tree} we mean a nonempty uniform $d$-dimensional clutter without any CF-cycle.\n\nAlso motivated by a result of \\cite{all}, a definition of chordal clutters is proposed by Bigdeli, et al\n\\cite{chordal}. An SC $e$ of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is said to be \\textit{simplicial}, if   ${\\mathrm{N}}[e]= e\\cup\\{v\\in [n]|e\\cup\\{v\\}\\in\n{\\EuScript{C}}\\}$ is a \\emph{clique} in ${\\EuScript{C}}$ (that is, for all $F{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}[e]$ with $|F|=d+1$, we have $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$). We denote\nthe set of simplicial submaximal circuits of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ by ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. If there exists a sequence $e_1,\\ldots, e_t$\nwith $e_i\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}\\left({ {\\EuScript{C}}-e_1- \\cdots - e_{i-1} }\\right)$ such that ${\\EuScript{C}}-e_1 -\\cdots -e_t= {\\emptyset}$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is said to\nbe \\textit{chordal}.\n\nRemark 3.10 of \\cite{all} states that if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a chordal clutter, then $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}})$ has a linear resolution\nover every field. It still remains an open question whether the converse is also true. It is known that if a\ngraded ideal $I$  of $S$ generated in one degree has linear quotients, then it has a linear resolution (see\n\\cite[Proposition 8.2.1]{hibi}). Thus as part of studying the converse of \\cite[Remark 3.10]{all} mentioned above,\none can investigate whether if $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ has linear quotients, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal. In this regards, we\npresent some relations between chordality and having linear quotients in Section 2. In particular, we prove that\nif $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is squarefree stable, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\nIn Section 3, we try to find some classes of CF-trees which are chordal. We prove that if ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ is a\nvertex decomposable simplicial complex, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a CF-tree which is also chordal. Furthermore, we prove that\nevery CF-tree ${\\EuScript{C}}$ on at most $\\dim {\\EuScript{C}}+3$ vertices is chordal.\n\nIn Section 4, we study three other generalizations of cycles to clutters. Using these notions of cycles, we\npresent several generalizations of chordal graphs to clutters and study the relation of these generalizations with\nthe condition that $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}})$ has a linear resolution and also with chordality of ${\\EuScript{C}}$.\n\nBefore stating the main results, we present a brief review of simplicial complexes.\n\n\\subsection*{A brief review of simplicial complexes}\n\nA \\emph{simplicial complex} on vertex set $V$ is a family $\\Delta$ of subsets of $V$ (called \\emph{faces }of\n$\\Delta$) such that if $A{\\subseteq} B\\in \\Delta$, then $A\\in \\Delta$. We always assume that the vertex set is\n$V(\\Delta)=[n]$, unless specified otherwise. For each $F\\in \\Delta$, $\\dim F=|F|-1$ and $\\dim \\Delta= \\max_{F\\in\n\\Delta}\\dim F$. The set of maximal faces of $\\Delta$ which are called \\emph{facets} is denoted by ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)$. If\n$|{\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)|=1$, then $\\Delta$ is called a \\emph{simplex}.\n\nIf all facets of $\\Delta$ have the same dimension --- as we always assume in the sequel --- we say that $\\Delta$\nis pure. In this case ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)$ is a $d$-dimensional uniform clutter. Also if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a clutter, then ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}\n{\\rangle}$ denotes the simplicial complex $\\Delta$ with ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)= {\\EuScript{C}}$. By the \\emph{clique complex} of a $d$-clutter\n${\\EuScript{C}}$ on $[n]$ we mean the family of all subsets $L$ of $[n]$ with the property that $L$ is a clique in ${\\EuScript{C}}$.\nNote that all subsets of $[n]$ with size $\\leq d$ are cliques by assumption. Now let ${\\mathcal{N}}(\\Delta)$ be the family\nof minimal non-faces of $\\Delta$, which is a clutter. Then $I({\\mathcal{N}}(\\Delta))$ is called the \\emph{Stanley-Reisner\nideal} of $\\Delta$ and is denoted by $I_\\Delta$. When ${\\frac{{S}}{{I_\\Delta}}}$ is a Cohen-Macaulay ring, $\\Delta$ is\ncalled Cohen-Macaulay over $k$ or $k$-Cohen-Macaulay.\n\nFor a face $F$ of $\\Delta$ and a set $L{\\subseteq} [n]$, we define ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta F= \\{G{\\setminus } F|G\\in \\Delta\\}$ and $\\Delta|_L\n=\\{G\\in \\Delta| G{\\subseteq} L\\}$. Moreover, we call $\\Delta$ \\emph{$d$-complete} when $\\Delta$ has all $(d+1)$-subsets of\n$[n]$. We call a family ${\\EuScript{C}}$ of $k$-dimensional faces of $\\Delta$ a \\emph{$k$-cycle}, if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a CF-cycle as a\nclutter.\n\nLet $A$ be a commutative ring with identity and denote by ${\\widetilde{{C}}}_d(\\Delta)= {\\widetilde{{C}}}_d(\\Delta, A)$ the free\n$A$-module whose basis is the set of all $d$-dimensional faces of $\\Delta$.

If ${\\EuScript{C}}_{t+1}$ is a simplex or ${\\EuScript{C}}_{t+1}={\\emptyset}$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}_{t+1}$ and hence\n${\\EuScript{C}}$ are chordal. Thus we can assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}_{t+1}= {\\EuScript{C}}-v \\neq {\\emptyset}$. Then by {(\\oldref{{v-deletion}})}, we have ${\\langle}\n{\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\rangle}=\\Delta{\\setminus } v$ is vertex decomposable with fewer vertices. Consequently, by induction it follows that\n${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\nTo show that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a CF-tree, note that as all $e_i$'s found above are leafs, we have indeed proved that there\nis a sequence $e_1, \\ldots, e_k$ such that $e_i$ is a leaf of ${\\EuScript{C}}-e_1\\cdots-e_{i-1}$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}- e_1\\cdots- e_k=\n{\\emptyset}$. Now assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}'{\\subseteq} {\\EuScript{C}}$ is a CF-cycle. As every SC of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ has even degree, we see that $e_1\\notin\n{\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}}')$. So ${\\EuScript{C}}'{\\subseteq} {\\EuScript{C}}-e_1$. Whence by a similar argument $e_2\\notin {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}}')$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}'{\\subseteq} {\\EuScript{C}}-e_1-e_2$.\nContinuing this way, we see that in fact ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\emptyset}$, which means, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has no CF-cycles.\n\nFor the in particular case, just note that if ${\\EuScript{C}}={\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)$, then $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})= I_{\\Delta({\\EuScript{C}})}$ and since ${\\EuScript{C}}$\nis a CF-tree, it follows that $\\Delta({\\EuScript{C}})= \\Delta'$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n                                            \n\n\nAn example of a CF-tree which is not chordal is presented in \\cite[p. 17]{Connon}, which is a triangulation of the\nmod 3 Moore space (see \\oldref{fig2}). But constructing such examples is hard. A question that may arise is that\nfor which $n$ and $d$ we can find a non-chordal $d$-dimensional CF-tree on $n$ vertices. Considering this question\nwe have:\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[scale= 0.8]{fig2.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{A triangulation of the mod 3 Moore space; the circuits are the small triangles} \\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{ssc is leaf}\nLet ${\\EuScript{C}}$ be a CF-tree.

For this we need a\nconcept which we call a CF-chorded clutter. Using the notion of CF-cylces, Connon and Faridi defined\n\\textit{chorded simplicial complexes} (see \\cite[Definitions 8.2 and 4.2]{CF1}). We say that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is\n\\emph{CF-chorded}, when the clique complex of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a chorded simplicial complex in the sense of Connon and\nFaridi. Here we do not state the exact definition. What is important for us is that $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}})$ has a linear\nresolution over any field of characteristic 2 {if and only if } ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is CF-chorded (see \\cite[Theorem 18]{CF2}). In\nparticular, CF-trees are CF-chorded and hence have linear resolution over fields of characteristic 2. Also it\nfollows immediately from the definition of a CF-chorded clutter such as ${\\EuScript{C}}$ that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has a clique on a\n($d+2$)-subset of the vertex set of any CF-cycle in ${\\EuScript{C}}$ (see \\cite[Defenitions 8.2, 4.2 and 4.1]{CF1}).\n\nWe call $\\{e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})|\\deg(e)$ is odd$\\}$ the \\emph{boundary of ${\\EuScript{C}}$} and denote it by ${\\partial}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Also we\nsay that a simplicial complex $\\Delta$ is \\emph{almost $d$-complete} when $\\Delta$ contains all $(d+1)$-subsets of\n$[n]$ except exactly one of them.\n\\begin{thm}\\label{dual}\nLet $d'=n-d-2$.

Set ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)$ and\n${\\EuScript{C}}={\\EuScript{C}}'^\\vee$. Then by the Eagon-Reiner theorem, $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}})$ has a linear resolution over ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$. Hence by\n\\cite[Theorem 18]{CF2} ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is CF-chorded. Now assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has a CF-cycle. Then as noted in the remarks\nbefore the theorem, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ should contain a clique on a set $L$ of $d+2$ vertices. Let ${\\overline{{L}}}$ denote $[n]{\\setminus } L$.\nThen $\\dim {\\overline{{L}}}=d'-1$ and by assumption, ${\\overline{{L}}}\\in \\Delta$. Whence there is a $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}'$ such that ${\\overline{{L}}}{\\subseteq} F$.\nSo ${\\overline{{F}}}\\notin {\\EuScript{C}}$ and ${\\overline{{F}}}{\\subseteq} L$, which is in contradiction with $L$ being a clique.\n\nConsequently, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has no CF-cycles and is a $d$-dimensional CF-tree. Thus by {(\\oldref{{1}})} and {(\\oldref{{trees have leaf}})}, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has a leaf, say $e$. Set $L={\\overline{{e}}}$, then $|L|=n-d=d'+2$. Now a $(d'+1)$-subset $F{\\subseteq} L$ is a\nfacet of $\\Delta$ {if and only if } $e{\\subseteq} {\\overline{{F}}}$ is not a circuit in ${\\EuScript{C}}$. As $e$ is a leaf and there is just one\ncircuit containing $e$, we conclude that $\\Delta|_L$ is almost d-complete.\n\n{(\\oldref{{2}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{1}})}: Suppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a $d$-dimensional CF-tree. Then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is CF-chorded and hence\nby \\cite[Theorem 18]{CF2}, $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}})$ has a linear resolution over ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$ and $\\Delta={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}^\\vee{\\rangle}$\nis Cohen-Macaulay. Also an argument similar to the first paragraph of {(\\oldref{{1}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{2}})}, shows that\n$\\Delta$ has all possible faces of size $d'$. So the assumptions of {(\\oldref{{2}})} hold for $\\Delta$ and it is easy to\nsee that if $L$ is as in {(\\oldref{{2}})}, then ${\\overline{{L}}}$ is a leaf of ${\\EuScript{C}}$. Therefore every $d$-dimensional CF-tree on $[n]$\nhas a leaf and by {(\\oldref{{trees have leaf}})}, the result follows.\n\n{(\\oldref{{2}})} ${\\Leftrightarrow}$ {(\\oldref{{3}})}: Suppose that $\\Delta$ is a $d'$-dimensional simplicial complex on $[n]$, which is\n$(d'-1)$-complete. We just need to show that $\\Delta$ is Cohen-Macaulay over ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$ {if and only if } it satisfies {(\\oldref{{-2}})}.\nSet $d_F= \\dim {\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta F= d'-|F|$. By the Reisner theorem (see \\cite[Theorem 8.1.6]{hibi}), $\\Delta$ is\nCohen-Macaulay {if and only if } for all $F\\in \\Delta$ and $i<d_F$, ${\\widetilde{{H}}}_i({\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta F; {\\mathbb{Z}}_2)=0$. But by\n\\cite[Proposition 5.1]{Connon},  for an $x=\\sum_{F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}} F\\in {\\widetilde{{C}}}_i(\\Delta)$ we have $x\\in \\ker {\\partial}_i$ {if and only if }\n${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a disjoint union of CF-cycles. Also it is easy to check that ${\\partial}_{i} (x)= \\sum_{F\\in {\\partial}({\\EuScript{C}})} F$.\nTherefore, ${\\widetilde{{H}}}_i({\\mathrm{link}} F; {\\mathbb{Z}}_2)=0$ {if and only if } each $i$-cycle of ${\\mathrm{link}} F$ is the boundary of a family of\n$(i+1)$-dimensional faces of ${\\mathrm{link}} F$.\n\nEach ${\\mathrm{link}} F$ is $(d_F-1)$-complete (on the vertex set $[n]{\\setminus } F$), for $\\Delta$ is $(d'-1)$-complete. Therefore,\n${\\widetilde{{H}}}_i({\\mathrm{link}} F; {\\mathbb{Z}}_2)=0$ for $i<d_F-2$. Also if $|F|>d'-1$, then $d_F\\leq 0$ and again ${\\widetilde{{H}}}_i({\\mathrm{link}} F;\n{\\mathbb{Z}}_2)=0$ for all $i<d_F$. So $\\Delta$ is Cohen-Macaulay {if and only if } for each $F\\in \\Delta$ with $|F|\\leq d'-1$, each\n$(d_F-1)$-cycle of ${\\mathrm{link}} F$ is the boundary of a set of facets of ${\\mathrm{link}} F$. Let $A={\\overline{{F}}}$. Then every\n$(d_F-1)$-cycle of ${\\mathrm{link}} F$ is clearly a CF-cycle on $A$. Also as ${\\mathrm{link}} F$ contains all $d_F$-subsets of $A$,\nthe circuits of every possible $(d_F-1)$-cycle on vertex set $A$ are in ${\\mathrm{link}} F$, that is, CF-cycles with\ndimension $=d_F-1$ with vertex set $A$ are exactly $(d_F-1)$-cycles of ${\\mathrm{link}} F$. Noting that $d_F-1=\n|A|-(n-d'+1)$, the result follows.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{cor}\\label{low n}\nIf $n\\leq d+3$, then every $d$-dimensional CF-tree on $[n]$ has a leaf and is chordal.\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nThe cases $n\\leq d+2$ are easy. So assume $n=d+3$. We show that {(\\oldref{{dual}})}{(\\oldref{{2}})} holds. Let $\\Delta$ be a\nnon-complete 1-dimensional ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$-Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex which is 0-complete. It is known that every\nCohen-Macaulay complex is connected. As $\\Delta$ is not complete, there are non-adjacent vertices $x,y$ of\n$\\Delta$. Suppose that $x,y$ have the least possible distance, that is, two. Then there is a vertex $z$ adjacent\nto both $x$ and $y$. Now $L=\\{x,y,z\\}$ has the requirements of {(\\oldref{{dual}})}{(\\oldref{{2}})}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n                          \\section{Some Other Generalizations of Cycles and Chordal Graphs}\n\n\nSuppose that $A$ is a set of vertices [resp. SC's] of ${\\EuScript{C}}$. We call $\\{F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}|F{\\subseteq} A\\}$ [resp. $\\{F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}|\n{\\mathcal{SC}}(\\{F\\}) {\\subseteq} A\\}$], the \\emph{subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ induced by $A$}. Note that a subclutter induced by a set of\nvertices $A$, is also induced by the set of SC's which are contained in $A$.  Let $i\\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. We say ${\\EuScript{C}}$\nis a \\emph{{C$_{i}$}-cycle}, when either it is a complete clutter with $n=d+2$ or ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})={\\emptyset}$ and\n${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}')\\neq {\\emptyset}$ for each ${\\EuScript{C}}'\\subsetneq {\\EuScript{C}}$ such that:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item for $i=1$, ${\\emptyset} \\neq {\\EuScript{C}}'$;\n\n\\item for $i=2$, ${\\emptyset}\\neq {\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a subclutter induced by a subset of ${\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$;\n\n\\item for $i=3$, ${\\emptyset}\\neq {\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a subclutter induced by a set of vertices of ${\\EuScript{C}}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nIt is easy to check that in the case $d=1$ all of these types of cycles coincide with the usual cycles of graphs.\nAlso clearly every \\C1-cycle is a \\C2-cycle and every \\C2-cycle is a \\C3-cycle. But the converse is not true as\nthe following examples show.\n\\begin{ex}\\label{c3 not c2}\nLet ${\\EuScript{C}}$ be the set of facets of $\\Gamma$ in \\cite[Example 16]{CF2}, that is, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is the set of all 3-subsets\nof $\\{0,1,\\ldots, 5\\} $ except 012, 345. Then it is straightforward to check that ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})={\\emptyset}$ and each\nnon-trivial vertex induced subclutter  of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has a SSC. So ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a \\C3-cycle. But ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}-12)={\\emptyset}$, thus\n${\\EuScript{C}}$ is not a C2-cycle.\n\\end{ex}\n\nTo present an example of a \\C2-cycle which is not a \\C1-cycle, we need the following lemmas.\n\\begin{lem}\\label{deg2 are c1}\nIf ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a strongly connected $d$-clutter with $\\deg(e)=2$ for all $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a\n\\C1-cycle.\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\nNote that if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ contains a clique ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ on more than $d+1$ vertices, then $\\deg_{{\\EuScript{C}}'}(e)=2$ for\neach $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}}')$. Therefore ${\\EuScript{C}}{\\setminus } {\\EuScript{C}}'$ does not share any SC with ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ (else, that SC has\ndegree $>2$). But this contradicts the strongly connectedness of ${\\EuScript{C}}$, unless ${\\EuScript{C}}{\\setminus } {\\EuScript{C}}'= {\\emptyset}$.\nHence in this case ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is complete and because each SC has degree 2, $n=d+2$. So ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a \\C1-cycle.\n\nThus we can assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ contains no cliques. So $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$ is a simplicial SC {if and only if } $\\deg(e)=1$. In\nparticular, ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})= {\\emptyset}$. If ${\\EuScript{C}}'{\\subseteq} {\\EuScript{C}}$ has no SSC, then by an argument similar to the above paragraph,\none concludes that ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\EuScript{C}}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{|cycle|>d+1}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a $d$-dimensional CF-cycle, then $d+2\\leq |{\\EuScript{C}}|$.\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\nSuppose that $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$. Then $F$ contains $d+1$ SC's, say $e_1$, \\ldots, $e_{d+1}$. As ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a\nCF-cycle, $e_i$ should be contained in another circuit of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ which we call $F_i$. If for some $i\\neq j$ we\nhave $F_i=F_j$, then $F_i$ and $F$ have two SC's in common and hence $F=F_i$, a contradiction. Thus all $F_i$'s are\ndistinct and we have found at least $d+2$ circuits in ${\\EuScript{C}}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\emph{Strong components} of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ are the maximal strongly connected subclutters of ${\\EuScript{C}}$.\n\\begin{lem}\\label{rnd=U cycles}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\partial}({\\EuScript{C}})$ is non-empty. Then ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a disjoint union of CF-cycles.\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\nConsider $x=\\sum_{F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}} F\\in {\\widetilde{{C}}}_d({\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}, {\\mathbb{Z}}_2)$. Then it can easily be checked that\n$y={\\partial}_d(x)=\\sum_{F'\\in {\\EuScript{C}}'} F'$. Thus ${\\partial}_{d-1}(y)=0$. So according to  \\cite[Propositin 5.1]{Connon}, each\nstrong component of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a CF-cycle. Whence ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a disjoint union of CF-cycles.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{ex}\\label{c2 not c1}\nLet ${\\EuScript{C}}$ be the 2-clutter in \\oldref{fig1}, which is a triangulation of the real projective plane. ${\\EuScript{C}}'= {\\EuScript{C}}\n\\cup \\{abc\\}$. Then ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a \\C2-cycle but not a \\C1-cycle.\n\\end{ex}\n\\begin{proof}\nIt follows from the previous lemma that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a \\C1-cycle. Also it is not hard to check that no SC-induced\nsubclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has exactly the set $\\{ab, ac, bc\\}$ as the set of leaves. One can readily check that ${\\EuScript{C}}'$\nhas no cliques on more than 3 vertices. Thus simplicial SC's of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ and its subclutters are exactly their\nleaves. So ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}')= {\\emptyset}$. As ${\\EuScript{C}}{\\subseteq} {\\EuScript{C}}'$ has no simplicial SC, we see that ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is not a \\C1-cycle.\n\nSuppose ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is a non-trivial subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ induced by $A{\\subseteq} {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}}')$. If either of $ab,\\, ac$ or $bc$\nare in $A$, then ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is also an SC-induced subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and has some simplicial SC. If $ab,ac,bc\\notin\nA$, then ${\\EuScript{D}}'= {\\EuScript{D}}{\\setminus } \\{abc\\}$ is an SC-induced subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and has an SC. Note that in fact, ${\\EuScript{D}}'$ is a\nCF-tree, hence ${\\partial}({\\EuScript{D}}')\\neq {\\emptyset}$ and {(\\oldref{{rnd=U cycles}})} and {(\\oldref{{|cycle|>d+1}})}, ${\\EuScript{D}}'$ has at least three SC's\nwith odd degree, that is, three leaves. Hence it has a leaf other than $ab$, $ac$ and $bc$, which remains a leaf\nin ${\\EuScript{D}}$, too. Consequently, every not-trivial SC-induced subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ has a simplicial SC, whence ${\\EuScript{C}}'$\nis a \\C2-cycle.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[scale= 0.8]{fig1.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{A triangulation of the real projective plane; the circuits are the small triangles} \\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{ex}\nLet ${\\EuScript{C}}$ be the triangulation of the mod 3 Moore space in \\oldref{fig2}. Then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a CF-tree without leaves.\nSo ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})={\\emptyset}$. Also it is easy to see that every subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has a leaf. Hence ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a \\C1-cycle\n(hence \\C2 and \\C3) which is not a CF-cycle. If ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\EuScript{C}}\\cup \\{xyz\\}$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a CF-cycle which is not a\n\\C1-cycle, for the subclutter ${\\EuScript{C}}$  of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ has no SSC's.\n\\end{ex}\n\nWe saw that there are clutters without any CF-cycle which do not have SSC's. But if we replace CF-cycle with {C$_i$}-cycle, then we have:\n\\begin{prop}\\label{acyclic => leaf}\nAssume that $i\\in [3]$ and no subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a {C$_{i}$}-cycle, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has a leaf. In particular, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is\nchordal and $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ has a linear resolution.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nIt suffices to prove the claim for $i=1$. Suppose that ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}')= {\\emptyset}$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a minimal\nnon-empty subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ with this property. Then ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is a \\C1-cycle, a contradiction. Hence\n${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}')\\neq {\\emptyset}$ for each non-empty subclutter ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ of ${\\EuScript{C}}$. Also if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has a clique\non more than $\\dim {\\EuScript{C}}+1$ vertices, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ contains a complete \\C1-cycle. Thus ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has no such\ncliques and whence if $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, then $e$ should be a leaf. So every non-empty subclutter of\n${\\EuScript{C}}$, including  ${\\EuScript{C}}$ itself, has a leaf.\n\\end{proof}\n\nA graph is chordal {if and only if } no induced subgraph is a non-complete cycle. Thus using either of the above notions of\ncycle and using either inducing by vertices or inducing by ${\\mathcal{SC}}$'s, we get generalizations of chordal graphs to\nclutters. But the following examples show that none of these generalizations preserve the Fr\\\"oberg theorem.\n\n\n\\begin{ex}\\label{not chordal by ci}\nLet ${\\EuScript{C}}$ be the octahedron, that is, ${\\EuScript{C}}= \\{1e,2e|e=34,45,56,63\\}$.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\EuScript{C}} \\cup \\{135, 235, 435, 635\\}$ is chordal and hence $I({\\overline{{ {\\EuScript{C}}'}}})$ has a linear resolution over\n    every field. But ${\\EuScript{C}}= {\\EuScript{C}}'-\\{35\\}$ is an SC-induced non-complete {C$_{i}$}-cycle ($i\\in [3]$) and also CF-cycle\n    of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$.\n\n\\item If ${\\EuScript{C}}''= {\\EuScript{C}} \\cup \\{435\\}$, then every non-empty vertex induced subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}''$ has a leaf. So\n    ${\\EuScript{C}}''$ has no vertex induced {C$_{i}$}-cycles ($i\\in [3]$) or CF-cycles. But ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is not chordal and $I({\\overline{{     {\\EuScript{C}}''}}})$ has not a linear resolution over ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$ because it is not CF-chorded.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{ex}\nOn the positive side we have:\n\\begin{prop}\\label{ci and chordality}\nConsider the following statements on a $d$-clutter ${\\EuScript{C}}$.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item No SC-induced subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a non-complete C$_2$-cycle.\n\n\\item ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\n\\item No vertex induced subclutter of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a non-complete C$_3$-cycle.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThen {(\\oldref{{1}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{2}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{3}})}.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\n{(\\oldref{{1}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{2}})}: It is easy to see that {(\\oldref{{1}})} is equivalent to ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}') \\neq {\\emptyset}$ for each\nnon-empty SC-induced subclutter ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ of ${\\EuScript{C}}$. So there is $e_1\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, $e_2\\in\n{\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}-e_1)$, \\ldots and ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\n{(\\oldref{{2}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{3}})}: Again {(\\oldref{{3}})} is equivalent to ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}') \\neq {\\emptyset}$ for each non-empty vertex\ninduced subclutter ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ of ${\\EuScript{C}}$. As any vertex induced subclutter is obtained by consecutively deleting\nsome vertices, we just need to show that if ${\\EuScript{C}}-v\\neq {\\emptyset}$, then ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}-v)\\neq {\\emptyset}$ for a chordal\nclutter ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and vertex $v$ of ${\\EuScript{C}}$. We prove this by induction on $|{\\EuScript{C}}|$.\n\nThe case $|{\\EuScript{C}}|=1$ is trivial. Suppose $|{\\EuScript{C}}|>1$. Let $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. If $v\\notin e$, then $e\\in\n{\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}-v)$. If $v\\in e$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}-v= {\\EuScript{C}} -e -v$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}-e$ is a chordal clutter with a smaller\nnumber of circuits. Hence the result follows from the induction hypothesis.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIt should be noted that if in {(\\oldref{{ci and chordality}})}{(\\oldref{{3}})}, we replace \\C3 with \\C2 or \\C1, again the result\nclearly holds. Also if we replace \\C3-cycle with face-minimal CF-cycle, then again the result holds, since chordal\nclutters are CF-chorded and it immediately follows the definition of CF-chorded clutters that such clutters can\nnot have induced non-complete face-minimal CF-cycles. But if we replace \\C2-cycle in {(\\oldref{{1}})} with \\C1-cycle or\nCF-cycle, then the obtained statement is not generally true. For example, ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ of {(\\oldref{{c2 not c1}})} contains no\nSC-induced \\C1-cycle or CF-cycle but it is not chordal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                             \\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\n\\bibitem{bal ver dec} J.

Then it follows from the Eagon-Reiner theorem (\\cite[Theorem 8.1.9]{hibi}) that $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}}}})$ has a linear\nresolution over $k$, {if and only if } ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}^\\vee {\\rangle}$ is Cohen-Macaulay over $k$. For more details on simplicial complexes\nand related algebraic concepts the reader is referred to \\cite{hibi}.\n\n\n                                     \\section{Chordality and Linear Quotients}\n\nIn this section we investigate the relationship between chordality of  ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and having linear quotient for\n$I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$. Example 3.15 of \\cite{chordal}, shows that not for all chordal clutters ${\\EuScript{C}}$, the ideal $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$\nhas linear quotients. Thus we focus on the question ``Are all clutters ${\\EuScript{C}}$ with $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ having linear\nquotients, chordal?''. Our first result shows that this question is equivalent to asking ``Do  all clutters ${\\EuScript{C}}$\nwith $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ having linear quotients, have an SSC?''\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{lin q closed under sc del}\nSuppose that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ has linear quotients and that $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Then $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ has linear quotients.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $I=I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$, $I'= I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ and suppose that $u_1, \\ldots, u_m$ is the linear quotient order  of the set\nof minimal generators of $I$, denoted by ${\\mathcal{G}}(I)$. Then ${\\mathcal{G}}(I')$ is the union of ${\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ and the set of squarefree\nmonomials $u$ of degree $d+1$ with $e{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{supp}}(u)=\\{i\\in [n]\\big| x_i|u\\}$. Denote the elements of ${\\mathcal{G}}(I'){\\setminus }\n{\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ by $u_{m+1}, \\ldots, u_t$. We show that $I'$ has linear quotients with respect to the order $u_1, \\ldots,\nu_t$. Set $F_i={\\mathrm{supp}}(u_i)$. By \\cite[Proposition 8.2.4]{hibi}, we have to show that for each $j<i\\leq t$, there\nare $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } F_i$ and $k<i$ such that $F_k{\\setminus } F_i=\\{l\\}$. If $i\\leq m$, this property holds since $u_1,\n\\ldots, u_m$ is an order of linear quotients. If $j\\geq m+1$, then as $e{\\subseteq} F_j\\cap F_i$, we have $|F_j{\\setminus } F_i|=1$\nand hence the required property again holds with $k=j$ and $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } F_i$.\n\nSo assume $j\\leq m< i$. Suppose that for each $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } e$, we have $el\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$. Then $F_j{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}[e]$ and since\n$e$ is simplicial, we should have $F_j\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ which means $u_j\\notin I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$, a contradiction. Therefore, there\nis a $l\\in F_j{\\setminus } e$ with $el\\notin{\\EuScript{C}}$. So $el\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and for some $k\\leq m$, we should have $el=F_k$.\nConsequently, this $k$ and $l$ satisfy the required property.\n\\end{proof}\n\nDue to the above result, we try to find some subclasses of ideals with linear quotients whose corresponding\nclutter has an SSC. One such class is the set of squarefree polymatroidal ideals. A monomial ideal $I$ is called\n\\emph{polymatroidal}, when all elements  of ${\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ have the same degree and if $u=x^{a_1} \\cdots x^{a_n}, v=\nx^{b_1} \\cdots x^{b_n} \\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ with $a_i>b_i$ for some $i$, then there is a $j$ with $a_j<b_j$ such that\n$x_ju/x_i\\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$. According to the symmetric exchange theorem (\\cite[Theorem 12.4.1]{hibi}), when $I$ is\npolymatroidal and $u,v,i$ are as above, then we can find a $j$ with $a_j<b_j$ and not only $x_ju/x_i\\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$ but\nalso $x_iv/x_j\\in {\\mathcal{G}}(I)$. Also by \\cite[Theorem 12.6.2]{hibi}, polymatroidal ideals have linear quotients.\n\n\\begin{prop}\nSuppose that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is polymatroidal. Then ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nClearly we can assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Also if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is complete then by \\cite[Corollary 3.12]{chordal},\n${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal. Thus we assume that ${\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Obviously if ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is the complete $d$-clutter on $[n]$,\nthen ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ is strongly connected. Thus as ${\\EuScript{C}} \\cup {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}={\\EuScript{C}}'$, we conclude that there is an $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\cap\n{\\mathcal{SC}}({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$. We show that $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\nAssume $A{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$, $A\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and $|A\\cap e|$ is maximum possible. If $|A\\cap e|=d$, then $A=ev$ for some\n$v\\in {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$, a contradiction. Suppose $|A\\cap e|<d$. Since $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$, there is a $F\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$\ncontaining $e$. Let $i\\in e{\\setminus } A$. Then by the  $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ being polymatroidal and by the symmetric exchange\ntheorem, we deduce that there exists a $j\\in A{\\setminus } F$ such that $A'= A{\\setminus } \\{j\\}\\cup \\{i\\}\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$. Note that\n$j\\notin e$, so $|A' \\cap e|> |A\\cap e|$ and also $A'{\\subseteq} A\\cup e{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$. This is against the choice of $A$.\nWe conclude that no such $A$ exists, that is, ${\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$ is a clique, as required.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe cannot deduce from this proposition that if $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is polymatroidal, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal, since\n$I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ may not be polymatroidal for any $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, as the following example shows.\n\\begin{ex}\nLet ${\\EuScript{C}}=\\{145, 245,345\\}$ on $[5]$. Then it is straightforward to check that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is polymatroidal. Note\nthat ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})=\\{ab|a=1,2,3, \\, b=4,5\\}$. Thus for every $e\\in{\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ is not polymatroidal.\nFor example if $e=14$, $F_1=145$ and $F_2=234$, then $F_1, F_2\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ and $1\\in F_1{\\setminus } F_2$ but there is no\n$j\\in F_2{\\setminus } F_1$ with $F_1{\\setminus } \\{1\\} \\cup\\{j\\}\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$.\n\\end{ex}\n\nAnother class of ideals with linear quotients are \\emph{squarefree stable ideals} [resp. \\emph{squarefree strongly\nstable ideals}], that is, squarefree monomial ideals such as $I$ with the property that for each squarefree\nmonomial $u\\in I$ and for each $j<m(u)$ [resp. $j<i$] with $x_j \\not| u$ [resp. $x_j \\not| u$ and $x_i|u$] one has\n$x_ju/x_{m(u)}\\in I$ [resp. $x_j u/x_i\\in I$] ($m(u)=$ the largest $i$ with $x_i|u$). Next we show that if\n$I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is squarefree stable, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ has an SSC and even more, ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{sq f sta}\nAssume that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ is squarefree stable, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nClearly we can assume that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$. For each $1\\leq i\\leq d$, let $a_i$ be the minimum number $\\neq a_1,\n\\ldots, a_{i-1}$ in $[n]$, for which there is a $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ with $a_1, \\ldots, a_i\\in F$. Set $e=a_1\\cdots a_d$.\nObviously $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. We show that $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$ and $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ is squarefree stable. Then the result\nfollows by induction.\n\nSuppose that $F{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}[e]$, $F\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and $|F\\cap e|$ is maximum possible. By the way we chose $a_i$'s, we know\nthat for each $b\\in {\\mathrm{N}}[e]{\\setminus } e$, we have $b>a_d>\\cdots> a_1$, in particular, $m(x_F)\\notin e$. If $|F\\cap e|=d$,\nthen $F=eb$ for some $b\\in {\\mathrm{N}}[e]$, that is, $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ a contradiction. Thus we can assume that $|F\\cap e|<d$.\nHence $e{\\setminus } F\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Set $b'=\\min e{\\setminus } F$. Then as $x_F\\in I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})$ which is squarefree stable, we deduce\nthat $F'= F{\\setminus } \\{m(x_F)\\}\\cup \\{b'\\}\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$. Note that $F'\\cap e$ strictly contains $F\\cap e$ and by maximality\nof $|F\\cap e|$, we should have $F'\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$, a contradiction. From this contradiction we conclude that $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$\nand hence $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\nNext suppose that $F\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ with $b=m(x_F)$ and let $b'<b$ with $b'\\notin F$ and $F'=F{\\setminus } \\{b\\}\\cup\n\\{b'\\}$. We should prove that $F'\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$, to show that $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})$ is squarefree stable. If $F\\notin\n{\\EuScript{C}}$, then $F\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$ and it follows that $F'\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}{\\subseteq} {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$. If $F\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$, then we should have $e{\\subseteq}\nF$ and hence $b\\notin e$. Consequently, $e{\\subseteq} F'$ which results to $F'\\notin {\\EuScript{C}}-e$. Hence $F'\\in {\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ and\nthe result is concluded.\n\\end{proof}\n\nClearly each squarefree strongly stable ideal is squarefree stable and hence we can apply the previous result on\nsuch ideals, too. But indeed, we can say more on chordality of squarefree strongly stable ideals. To see this, we\nneed to recall another concept which generalizes chordal graphs. Let ${\\EuScript{D}}$ be a clutter on $[n]$ which is not\nnecessarily uniform (that is the ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is a family of incomparable subsets of $[n]$ which may have different\nsizes). For $v\\in [n]$ by ${\\EuScript{D}}/v$ (\\emph{contraction} on $v$) we mean the clutter of minimal elements of $\\{F{\\setminus }\n\\{v\\}|F\\in {\\EuScript{D}}\\}$. In \\cite{w-chordal}, a vertex $v$ of ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is called \\emph{simplicial}, when from $v\\in F_1,\nF_2\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ we can deduce that there is a $F_3\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ with $F_3{\\subseteq} (F_1\\cup {\\mathcal{F}}_2){\\setminus } \\{v\\}$. Moreover in\n\\cite{w-chordal},  Woodroofe calls ${\\EuScript{D}}$ chordal (here we call ${\\EuScript{D}}$ \\emph{W-chordal}), when every clutter arising\nfrom ${\\EuScript{D}}$ by a series of vertex deletions and contractions, contains a simplicial vertex.\n\n\\begin{prop}\nAssume that $I({\\EuScript{C}})$ is squarefree strongly stable. Then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is both chordal and W-chordal.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nMore generally, let ${\\EuScript{D}}$ be a (not necessarily uniform) clutter with $I({\\EuScript{D}})$ squarefree strongly stable. It is\neasy to show that for any $v\\in [n]$, $I({\\EuScript{D}}-v)$ is squarefree strongly stable. We first show that $I({\\EuScript{D}}/v)$ is\nalso strongly stable. Suppose that $F\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$, $i\\in F$, $j\\notin F$ and $j<i$. We should prove that there is a\n$F'\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$ with $F'{\\subseteq} F\\cup \\{j\\}{\\setminus } \\{i\\}$. If $F\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$, by $I({\\EuScript{D}})$ being squarefree strongly stable,\nthere is a $F''\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ satisfying this containment and so there is a $F'\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$ with $F'{\\subseteq} F''$ and we are\ndone. If $F\\notin {\\EuScript{D}}$, then $F\\cup\\{v\\}\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$, so there is a $F''\\in {\\EuScript{D}}$ with $F''{\\subseteq} F\\cup \\{j,v\\}{\\setminus } \\{i\\}$.\nAgain there is a $F'\\in {\\EuScript{D}}/v$ with $F'{\\subseteq} F''{\\setminus }\\{v\\}$, as required.\n\nIt is easy to see that if $m$ is the maximum integer appearing in the union of all circuits of ${\\EuScript{D}}$, then $m$ is\na simplicial vertex. Thus ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is W-chordal. Furthermore, one could easily check that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{D}}}})$ is squarefree\nstrongly stable with respect to the reverse order on $[n]$. Consequently, if ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is also uniform, then by\n{(\\oldref{{sq f sta}})}, ${\\EuScript{D}}$ is chordal.\n\\end{proof}\nIt should be mentioned that in the above result, chordality of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ also follows its W-chordality, according to\n\\cite[Proposition 3.8]{chordal}.\n\n\n                                              \n\n\nNext we investigate, ideals with linear quotients which are the vertex cover ideal of some graph. Recall that the\n\\emph{vertex cover ideal} $I_G$ of a graph $G$ on $[n]$ is the ideal generated by all $x_C$'s where $C$ is a\nminimal vertex cover of $G$.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{ver cover ideal}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$ and $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})=I_G$ for a graph $G$ with the property that ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta({\\overline{G}}))$ is\nstrongly connected. Then ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $G$ is complete, then every $(n-1)$-subset of $[n]$ is a minimal vertex cover and it follows that ${\\EuScript{C}}={\\emptyset}$.\nThus $G$ is not complete. If $G$ has exactly one maximal independent set, then it easily follows that $E(G)={\\emptyset}$\nwhich means ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is complete and ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$. Thus we can assume that $G$ has at least two maximal\nindependent sets.  Note that as ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is assumed to be $d$-uniform, all minimal vertex covers and hence all\nmaximal independent sets of $G$ have the same size.\n\nSince facets of $\\Delta({\\overline{G}})$ are the maximal independent sets of $G$ and because ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta({\\overline{G}}))$ is strongly\nconnected, there exist two maximal independent sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ of $G$ with $|A_1\\cap A_2|=|A_1|-1= |A_2|-1$.\nSet $B=A_1\\cap A_2$ and suppose that $v_1\\in A_1{\\setminus } B, v_2 \\in A_2{\\setminus } B$. Consider $e=[n]{\\setminus } (A_1 \\cup A_2)$. Then\n$ev_1$ and $ev_2$ are minimal vertex covers of $G$. If $v\\in {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}}[e]{\\setminus } e$ and $v\\neq v_1, v_2$, then $ev$\nis a vertex cover of $G$ not containing any of $v_1,v_2$. Therefore, $v_1v_2$ is not an edge of $G$. On the other\nhand, since $A_1\\cup A_2$ is not an independent set and as $(A_1\\cup A_2 ){\\setminus } (A_1 \\cap A_2)=\\{v_1,v_2\\}$, we\nconclude that $v_1v_2$ is an edge. From this contradiction, it follows that ${\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}}[e]=ev_1v_2$.\n\nIf $ev_1v_2=[n]$, then $A_1\\cap A_2={\\emptyset}$ and hence maximal independent sets of $G$ are verieces, which means $G$\nis complete, against our assumption. Hence ${\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]\\neq {\\emptyset}$ and $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Let $A{\\subseteq} N_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$ and\n$|A|=d+1$. If $A\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$, then $A$ is a minimal vertex cover of $G$ and as $v_1v_2\\in E(G)$, one of $v_1$ and\n$v_2$, say $v_1$, is in $A$. But $v_1\\notin {\\mathrm{N}}_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$, a contradiction. Thus $A\\in {\\EuScript{C}}$ and $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{cor}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}\\neq {\\emptyset}$, $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})=I_G$ for a graph $G$ and $I_G$ has a linear resolution (for example if\n$I_G$ has linear quotients). Then ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})\\neq {\\emptyset}$.\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nSince $I_G=I(G)^\\vee=I_{\\Delta({\\overline{G}})^\\vee}$ has a linear resolution, it follows from the Eagon-Reiner theorem that\n$\\Delta({\\overline{G}})$ is a Cohen-Macaulay complex. Hence according to \\cite[Lemma 9.1.12]{hibi}, ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta({\\overline{G}}))$ is\nstrongly connected. Therefore, the result follows from {(\\oldref{{ver cover ideal}})}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nDespite the above result, we cannot deduce that in the situations of this result ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is chordal, because as the\nfollowing results show, the class of vertex cover ideals is not closed under removing SSC's. A graph is said to be\n\\emph{unmixed}, when all of its minimal vertex covers have the same size.\n\\begin{prop}\\label{ver cov ideal = sc deleted}\nSuppose that $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$ and ${\\mathcal{G}}(I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})){\\subseteq} {\\mathcal{G}}(I_G)$ for an unmixed graph on $[n]$. Then $n=d+2$ and $G$\nis a complete graph. In particular, $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}})= I_G$ for some graph $G$, {if and only if } $\\dim {\\EuScript{C}}=n-2$ and ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$\nis either a simplex or the union of two simplexes sharing an SC.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nNote that ${\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ contains all circuits which contain $e$, therefore each such subset of $[n]$ is a minimal\nvertex cover of $G$. Choose $v_1\\in [n]{\\setminus } e$. Then as $ev_1$ is a minimal vertex cover, there is an edge $v_1v_2$\nof $G$ with $v_2\\notin e$. Also each edge whose both ends are outside $e$, should have $v_1$ as one end and\nsimilarly $v_2$ as the other end. Thus $[n]=ev_1v_2$, and $n=d+2$. If $G$ is not complete, say $xy\\notin E(G)$ for\nsome $x,y\\in [n]$, then $G$ has a minimal vertex cover of size $<n-1$ contained in $[n]{\\setminus } xy$. This contradicts\nunmixedness of $G$, so $G$ is complete.\n\nFor the in particular case, first note that since ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is uniform, $G$ should be unmixed. Also because every\nnon-isolated vertex of a graph lies in a minimal vertex cover and by deleting isolated vertices of $G$, we can\nassume that $G$ has the same vertex set as ${\\EuScript{C}}$. Thus by the general part, we get $\\dim {\\EuScript{C}}=n-2$ and that\n${\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ is a complete $d$-clutter. But all circuits of ${\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}$ which does not contain $e$ are in ${\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$.\nIt follows that all circuits of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ contain $e$. Therefore, if $[n]{\\setminus } e=v_1v_2$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is either\n$\\{ev_1\\}$ or $\\{ev_2\\}$ or $\\{ev_1, ev_2\\}$, as required. The converse is clear.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{cor}\nSuppose that $I({\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}})=I_G$ for some graph $G$ and $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$. Then $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}))\\neq I_{G'}$ for any graph\n$G'$.\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $I({\\overline{{{\\EuScript{C}}-e}}}))= I_{G'}$ for some graph $G'$, then by {(\\oldref{{ver cov ideal = sc deleted}})} and using the fact that\n$e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}})$, it follows that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ should be a $(n-2)$-dimensional simplex, say ${\\EuScript{C}}=\\{ev_1\\}$ where $[n]{\\setminus }\ne=v_1v_2$. Thus $ev_2\\in I_G$ is a minimal vertex cover of $G$. So there is an edge in $G$ with one end $v_2$ and\nthe other end outside of $e$. As in the proof of the above result, we should have $V(G)=[n]$, thus $v_1v_2\\in\nE(G)$. From this it follows that $ev_1$ is also a minimal vertex cover of $G$, that is, $ev_1\\in {\\overline{{\\EuScript{C}}}}$, a\ncontradiction from which the result follows.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn \\cite[Lemma 3.11]{chordal}, it is proved that if ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is the complete $d$-clutter on $[n]$ and $v\\in [n]$,\nthen there is a sequence $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_t$, such that $e_i\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}({\\EuScript{C}}-e_1-\\cdots- e_{i-1})$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}- e_1-\n\\cdots- e_{t}= {\\EuScript{C}}-v$. They used this result, to prove that ``E-chordal'' clutters (another generalization of\nchordal graphs introduced by Emtander in \\cite{E-chordal}) are chordal. The final result of this section which\nprovides another proof of \\cite[Lemma 3.11]{chordal}, shows that there is an interesting relation between such\nsequences of SC's and orders of linear quotients of specific ideals. In this result by ${\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}'({\\EuScript{C}})$ we mean the\nset of SSC's of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and also those $d$-subsets of $[n]$ not contained in any circuit. Thus $N_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]$ is  clique\nfor all $e\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}'({\\EuScript{C}})$.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{lin q and ssc seq}\nSuppose ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is the complete $d$-clutter on $[n]$, $v\\in [n]$ and $E=\\{e \\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})| v\\in e\\}$. Set $e'=e{\\setminus }\n\\{v\\}$ for each $e\\in E$. For a sequence $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_t$ of different elements in $E$ the following are\nequivalent:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\label{1} $e_i\\in {\\mathcal{S}{\\mathcal{SC}}}'({\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1})$ for each $i\\in [t]$ where ${\\EuScript{C}}_{i}={\\EuScript{C}}-e_1-e_2-\\cdots-e_i$.\n\n\\item \\label{2} $x_{e'_1}, x_{e'_2}, \\ldots, x_{e'_t}$ is an order of linear quotients for $I={\\langle} x_{e'_1},\n    x_{e'_2}, \\ldots, x_{e'_t}  {\\rangle}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\n{(\\oldref{{1}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{2}})}: Suppose $j<i$. If $e_j{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$, then for $y\\in e_i{\\setminus } e_j$, we have\n$F=e_jy\\notin {\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}$ but  $F{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$, contradicting simpliciality of $e_i$. Thus there exists\nan $l\\in e_j{\\setminus } {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$. Hence $e_il$ is not a face of ${\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}$, that is, there is a $k< i$ with\n$e_k{\\subseteq} e_il$. Consequently, $e_k{\\setminus } e_i=\\{l\\}$. Clearly $l\\neq v$, therefore:\n\\centerline{\\hfill for each $j<i$ there is a $k< i$ and $l\\in [n]$ with $l\\in e'_j{\\setminus } e'_i$ and $e'_k{\\setminus } e'_i=\\{l\\}$ \\hfill ($*$)}\\\\\nThis is equivalent to {(\\oldref{{2}})} by \\cite[Corollary 8.2.4]{hibi}.\n\n{(\\oldref{{2}})} {$\\Rightarrow$}\\ {(\\oldref{{1}})}: By \\cite[Corollary 8.2.4]{hibi}, ($*$) holds. As $e_r=e'_rv$, we see that ($*$) still\nholds if we replace $e'$'s with $e$'s. Therefore it follows that $e_k{\\subseteq} e_il$ and $l\\notin {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$.\nSo $e_j\\not{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$ for each $j<i$. Thus for each $F{\\subseteq} {\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$ with $|F|=d+1$, $F\\in\n{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}$ and ${\\mathrm{N}}_{{\\EuScript{C}}_{i-1}}[e_i]$ is a clique.\n\\end{proof}\n\nNote that the set of all $e'_i$'s in the previous result, is the set of all $(d-1)$-subsets of $[n]$. Therefore,\n{(\\oldref{{lin q and ssc seq}})} provides a tool to check if a given order of generators of an squarefree monomial ideal\nwhich is generated in one degree, has linear quotients.\n\n\n                                     \\section{Chordality and CF-Trees}\n\n\nIn this section, we consider the question ``which CF-trees are chordal?'' First we prove that the facets of a\nvertex decomposable simplicial complex form a CF-tree which is chordal. Recall that a pure simplicial complex\n$\\Delta$ is called \\emph{vertex decomposable}, when whether it is a simplex or there is a $v\\in V(\\Delta)$ such\nthat both ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v$ and $\\Delta{\\setminus } v (=\\Delta|_{V{\\setminus }\\{v\\}})$ are both pure vertex decomposable. We call the\nvertex $v$ a \\emph{decomposing vertex}. This concept was first introduced in \\cite{provan} in connection with the\nHirsch conjecture which has applications in the analysis of the simplex method in linear programming and later was\nstudied by other authors, for example see \\cite{obs to shell, bal ver dec}. Note that 0-dimensional vertex\ndecomposable simplicial complexes are ${\\langle} \\{v\\} {\\rangle}$ for a vertex $v$.\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{1-dim vdec = tree}\nSuppose that ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a 1-dimensional uniform clutter (that is, a graph). Then $\\Delta= {\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ is vertex\ndecomposable {if and only if } ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a tree. Also if $\\Delta$ is not a simplex, then $v$ is a decomposing vertex {if and only if } it\nis a leaf.\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\n({$\\Leftarrow$}): If $|{\\EuScript{C}}|=1$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is a simplex and vertex decomposable. Thus assume that $|{\\EuScript{C}}|>1$. Let $v$ be a\nleaf of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ and $l$ the vertex adjacent to $v$. Then ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v={\\langle} \\{l\\} {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable and\nbecause ${\\EuScript{C}}$ is connected, $l$ is adjacent to a vertex $\\neq v$. So $\\{l\\}\\notin {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta{\\setminus } v)$, that is,\n$\\Delta{\\setminus } v$ is pure and ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)$ is a tree with fewer vertices. Hence the result follows by induction.\n\n({$\\Rightarrow$}): Let $v$ be a decomposing vertex of $\\Delta$. Since ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v$ is 0-dimensional vertex decomposable,\nwe see that $\\deg(v)=1$. Again since $\\Delta{\\setminus } v$ is vertex decomposable with fewer vertices, the claim follows\nby induction.\n\\end{proof}\n\nSuppose that $\\Delta={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ and $v\\in [n]$. It could be possible that ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\rangle} \\neq \\Delta{\\setminus } v$, for\nexample if ${\\EuScript{C}}=\\{12,34\\}$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}-1=\\{34\\}$ but ${\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)=\\{34, 2\\}$. But we have\n\\begin{lem}\\label{v-deletion}\nAssume that $\\Delta={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable and $v$ is a decomposing vertex. Then if ${\\EuScript{C}}-v\\neq\n{\\emptyset}$, we have ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\rangle} = \\Delta{\\setminus } v$.\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\nIt is clear that ${\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\subseteq} {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)$. Let $F\\in {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta {\\setminus } v)$. Since ${\\emptyset}\\neq {\\EuScript{C}}-v{\\subseteq} {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta{\\setminus }\nv)$, and because $\\Delta{\\setminus } v$ is pure, we conclude that $\\dim F=d$. So $v\\notin F\\in {\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta)={\\EuScript{C}}$ and the\nclaim follows.\n\\end{proof}\n\nHere we call $e\\in {\\mathcal{SC}}({\\EuScript{C}})$ a \\emph{leaf}, when $\\deg(e)=1$.\n\\begin{thm}\\label{vdec has leaf}\nSuppose that $\\Delta= {\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}} {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable and not a simplex and $v$ is a decomposing vertex. Then\nthere exists a leaf $e$ of ${\\EuScript{C}}$ containing $v$ such that either ${\\EuScript{C}}-e={\\EuScript{C}} -v$ or ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-e {\\rangle}$ is vertex\ndecomposable and $v$ is a decomposing vertex of ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-e {\\rangle}$.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nWe prove the result by induction on $d$. The case $d=1$ follows from {(\\oldref{{1-dim vdec = tree}})}. Assume that $d>1$.\nSet $\\Delta'= {\\mathrm{link}}_\\Delta v$ and ${\\EuScript{C}}'={\\mathcal{F}}(\\Delta')$. If $\\Delta'$  is a simplex let $e'$ be any SSC of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$.\nElse let $e'$ be the SSC provided by the induction hypothesis. Using {(\\oldref{{v-deletion}})}, we see that in both cases,\n$e'$ is a leaf of ${\\EuScript{C}}'$ and either ${\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}'-e' {\\rangle}$ is vertex decomposable or ${\\EuScript{C}}'-e'={\\emptyset}$. Set $e=e'v$. Then\n$\\deg_{\\EuScript{C}}[e]=\\deg_{{\\EuScript{C}}'}[e']=1$. If ${\\EuScript{C}}'-e'={\\emptyset}$, then ${\\EuScript{C}}-e={\\EuScript{C}}-v$. Assume ${\\EuScript{C}}'-e'\\neq {\\emptyset}$ and let\n$\\Gamma'={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}'-e' {\\rangle}$ and $\\Gamma={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-e {\\rangle}$. Then ${\\mathrm{link}}_\\Gamma v=\\Gamma'$ which is vertex decomposable.\nIf ${\\EuScript{C}}-v\\neq {\\emptyset}$, then by {(\\oldref{{v-deletion}})} we get\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "$$ \\Delta{\\setminus } v={\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-v {\\rangle}= {\\langle} {\\EuScript{C}}-e-v {\\rangle} {\\subseteq} \\Gamma{\\setminus } v$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta{\\setminus}v={\\langle}{\\mathcal{C}}-v{\\rangle}={\\langle}{\\mathcal{C}}-e-%&#10;v{\\rangle}{\\subseteq}\\Gamma{\\setminus}v\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2216</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udc9e</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udc9e</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>\u2286</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo>\u2216</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
