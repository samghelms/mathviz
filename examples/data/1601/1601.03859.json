$\\gamma$-ray emission from CSOs remain open questions.\nA single-zone SSC emission model well fits the broadband SEDs from radio up to GeV energy bands in blazars and also in some misaligned AGN \\citep[e.g., M87:][]{Abdo09}. \nThe one-zone SSC model requires relativistic beaming. \nHowever, unlike the blazar jets, the CSO jets are in general mildly relativistic and unbeamed \\citep{AB12}. \nIt is obvious that this SSC model can not reproduce the $\\gamma$-ray emission from CSOs. \nSome other models have been investigated to interpret the $\\gamma$-ray radiation from CSOs.\nFor example,\n\\citet{Stawarz08} proposed that the relativistic electrons injected from the hot spots to the CSO lobes can up-scatter the ultraviolet photons from the disk to GeV energy range. \n\\citet{Migliori14} proposed a two-zone SSC jet model for  the $\\gamma$-ray emission from GPS and CSS quasars, in which the seed synchrotron photons which are from an inner blazar-like jet knot are up-scattered by the electrons in an outer slower jet knot.\nIn addition, bremsstrahlung emission from the shocked plasma in the cocoon of CSO  may also have a significant contribution to the high-energy emission \\citep{Kino09}.\nThe model predicts $\\gamma$-ray emission from CSOs that could be detected by {\\it Fermi}, since the electron density and temperature are much higher in the young radio lobes than those in older ones.\nThe difference of these models is that the first two \\citep{Stawarz08,Migliori14} are of non-thermal origin and and the last one \\citep{Kino09} is thermal. \n\nThe observational properties of 2234+282 make it a $\\gamma$-ray CSO candidate, increasing the number of $\\gamma$-ray CSO candidates from 2 to 3. \nThe number of CSOs detected in GeV energy range so far is significantly lower than predicted by theoretical models. \\cite{Filippo15} \\\\ searched 60 CSOs and analyzed 6 years of LAT data but failed to confirm any $\\gamma$-ray CSO.\nThe theoretical calculations show that the model-predicted $\\gamma$-ray flux is near or below the current {\\it Fermi} detection limit \\citep{Migliori14}.\nContinuing search of a complete CSO sample based on the {\\it Fermi} data at a lower energy range of 0.1 -- 10 GeV is underway \\citep{Filippo15} to verify whether the CSO emission is intrinsically dominated in low energy band.\nOn the other hand, the morphology, spectral properties and kinematics of these three sources suggest mildly relativistic jet. \nVLBI data of $\\gamma$-ray CSO candidates provide important information {\\bf on} the radio jet luminosity and jet speed, placing stringent constraints on the $\\gamma$-ray emission models. \nComplementary wide-band SED fits of these three sources are crucial for verifying whether the jet plays an important role in generating $\\gamma$-ray emission from CSOs \\citep[the model of \\\\][]{Migliori14}.\nIf however the $\\gamma$-ray emission from CSOs is found to be of thermal origin and related to the lobes, that would identify a new $\\gamma$-ray emission mechanism for AGN as proposed by \\citet{Kino09}. \n\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\nThe research is supported by the

The rarity of the $\\gamma$-ray emitting CSOs is a mystery as well.\nHere we present the radio properties of the $\\gamma$-ray CSO candidate 2234+282.\n}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nOne of the intriguing discoveries of the {\\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT)\nsurvey is the overwhelming majority (98 \\%) of the {\\it Fermi}-detected AGN classified as blazars\\\\ \\citep{Ackermann15}.\nIn leptonic models, $\\gamma$-ray radiation from blazars is mostly explained by Compton scattering of low-energy synchrotron photons by the same relativistic electrons in the jets producing the synchrotron emission at lower frequencies \\citep[e.g.,][]{BM96}; in hadronic models, the high-energy emission is dominated by relativistic protons \\citep[e.g.,][]{Bottcher10}.\nBesides the blazars, there are dozens of misaligned AGN detected by the {\\it Fermi} \\citep[e.g.,][]{Abdo10a,Ackermann15}. \\\\\nThe sample size is still small, though they constitute a very interesting class of $\\gamma$-ray emitters. Cen A (NGC 5128), Per A (NGC 1275) and M87 (3C 274) are three well-studied nearby radio galaxies in which \n$\\gamma$-ray emission was observed in the core. \nA single-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) jet model was successfully applied to fit the LAT $\\gamma$-ray spectrum of these radio galaxies, although other explanations exist \\citep[e.g.][]{Abdo09}. \nThese non-blazar gamma-ray AGN generally have moderate jet beaming, with Doppler boosting factor of 2 -- 4. \nExtended $\\gamma$-ray emission was also detected from Cen A lobes \\citep{Abdo10b},\nand it is interpreted as the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons by the relativistic electrons in the lobes.\n\nAmong the misaligned AGN, there is a sub-class named Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs), which are regarded as young radio galaxies \\citep[reviewed by][]{ODea98,Fanti09}. Theoretical models have predicted $\\gamma$-ray emission from CSOs \\citep{Stawarz08,Kino09,Migliori14}. \nHowever there are only two $\\gamma$-ray CSO candidates known to date, PMN J1603$-$4904 \\citep{McConville11} and 4C $+$55.17 \\citep{Muller14}. \nIn this paper, we report a new $\\gamma$-ray CSO candidate 2234+282.\n\n\n\\section{Sample selection and data reduction}\n\nIn order to increase the sample size of $\\gamma$-ray CSOs, we looked into the archival MOJAVE\\footnote{http://www.physics.purdue.edu/astro/MOJAVE/index.html} \\citep[Monitoring Of Jets in Active galactic nuclei with VLBA Experiments,][]{Lister09} database to search for new candidates.\n\nThe criteria of sample selection are : \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item the source has been identified by {\\it Fermi} with high statistical significance; \n\\item the radio morphology is of CSO type, characterised with compact double lobes with or without a central core;\n\\item the total flux density which is integrated over the whole source in each VLBI image shows a steep or GHz inverted (GPS type) spectrum.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nIn total, 344 AGN are cross-matched between the MOJAVE and {\\it Fermi} catalogues.\nAmong them, we found only one source, 2234+282 matching the above three criteria.\nSuch a low percentage (0.3\\%) is consistent with the rarity of the $\\gamma$-ray CSOs in general.\nDetails of the radio emission properties are given in the next Section, including the spectral index $\\alpha$ (defined as $S_\\nu \\propto \\nu^\\alpha$), the brightness temperature T$_\\mathrm{b}$ of the core, and hot spot advance speed ($\\beta_\\mathrm{adv}$). \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig1.eps}\n\\caption{Overlaid VLBI images of 2234$+$282 at 8.4 GHz (red contours) and 15 GHz (black contours). \nThe 8.4-GHz image was made from the VLBA data on 1996 May 15 (project code: BB023), the restoring beam (shown as a red ellipse in the bottom left corner) is 2.05 mas $\\times$ 0.87 mas at PA $= -12.8\\degr$.   \nThe peak brightness is 0.708 Jy beam$^{-1}$.\nThe contour levels increase by a factor of 2, and the lowest contour is 1.5 mJy beam$^{-1}$ ($3\\sigma$). \nThe 15-GHz data were obtained on 1996 May 16 (project code: BK037).\nThe restoring beam is 1.17 mas $\\times$ 0.49 mas at PA $= -23.4\\degr$ (shown as a black ellipse in the bottom left corner).  \nThe peak brightness is 0.421 Jy beam$^{-1}$, and the lowest contour is 1.1 mJy beam$^{-1}$ ($3\\sigma$). \n}\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{fig2.ps}\n\\caption{Radio flux density versus frequency.\nThe data points, obtained from the single dish or VLA measurements, are collected from the NED.\nThe radio spectrum is complex above 1 GHz due to variability.\nA significant decrease of flux density at 408 MHz suggests a low frequency turnover around 1 GHz.\n}\n\\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{CSO identification of 2234+282}\n\n2234+282 (also named as CTD 135) has a redshift $z = 0.79$.\nIts optical spectrum was described by \\citet{Shaw12}  as transitional between flat-spectrum quasars and BL Lac type objects. \nIt was detected by {\\it Fermi} with a statistical significance of 52.1$\\sigma$, corresponding to 3FGL J2236.3+2829 and 2FGL J2236.4+2828 \\citep{Acero15}, but not detected by the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope \\citep[EGRET;][]{Hartman99} of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, probably due to insufficient sensitivity. \n\nThe radio spectrum of the total flux density is complex above 1 GHz due to the variability of the non-simultaneous data points (Figure \\ref{fig2})\\footnote{http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/}. Except for that, there is a significant decrease in the flux density at 408 MHz, suggesting a low frequency turnover around 1 GHz in the spectrum. \nThe Very Large Array (VLA) observation performed at 1.5 GHz in 1984 revealed a bright compact component and a weak feature about 4.9\\arcsec to the southwest \\citep{Murphy93}.\n\nThe Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images at 2.3 GHz show a single compact component which is resolved along the northeast-southwest direction at frequencies higher than 5 GHz. \nFigure \\ref{fig1} shows the 15-GHz image (black contours) overlaid on the 8.4-GHz one (red contours). \nAt 15 GHz, the emission structure can be fitted with three Gaussian components, {\\tt NE}, {\\tt C} and {\\tt SW}.  \nComponent {\\tt C} is the most compact, and accounts for 65\\% of the total flux density. \nWe used circular Gaussians in the fitting to get the peak location and the size of the models, in order to simplify the comparison and to decrease the number of free parameters. \nOne fifth of the beam size is taken as the error of the position.\nComponents {\\tt NE} and {\\tt C} are still blended at 8.4 GHz.\nThe combined {\\tt NE+C} component shows a somewhat steep spectrum with a spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.43 \\pm 0.07$ (Figure \\ref{fig3}-a).\nThe details of the VLBI observations used here to describe the spectral index of the source are given in Table \\ref{t_VLBA}. The weaker {\\tt SW} component shows an inverted spectrum with a turnover around 4 GHz. \nThe spectrum of the optically thin section is rather steep, showing $\\alpha = -2.50 \\pm 0.18$. \n\nSince 2009 the MOJAVE program observations of the source were performed in full polarization. According to those the polarized emission is concentrated in components {\\tt NE} and {\\tt C}. \nComponent {\\tt C} does not show evident variation in polarization, but {\\tt NE} shows significant variability in the polarized intensity at 15 GHz on a time scale of a few months. \n\nComponents {\\tt C} and {\\tt NE} can be resolved only at 15 GHz and frequencies above. \nSince there has been no simultaneous observation at 15 and 24 GHz, and the source is variable (see below), an accurate estimation of the spectral index of component {\\tt C} is not possible.\nEven though, the central component {\\tt C} is the brightest and most compact one among the three. \nThe brightness temperature of {\\tt C} ranges from $3.4 \\times 10^{10}$ K to $1.5 \\times 10^{12}$ K at 15 GHz. Thus {\\tt C} is most likely the core.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{fig3.eps}\n\\caption{Panel {\\it a)} shows the radio spectra of the VLBI components in 2245+282.\nThe dashed line indicates the power law fit to the spectrum of the component {\\tt C+NE}. \nThe dotted line represents the model fit to the spectrum of {\\tt SW} by using a power law together with the free-free absorption.
