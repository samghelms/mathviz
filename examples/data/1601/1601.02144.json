For instance, \\cite{kemper_etal_2004} well reproduce the interstellar absorption band using \na mixture composed of $\\sim15.1$\\% of amorphous pyroxene and $\\sim84.9$\\% of amorphous olivine by mass, leading to a crystalline \nfraction of the interstellar silicates around $0.2$\\%. The proto-solar Nebula is supposed to have been formed from material \ncoming from the ISM. As a consequence, the primordial dust in the Solar System should be composed of amorphous solids except grains which have undergone\neither a thermal annealing in high temperature regions (\\textit{i.e.} around $1000-1500$ K) close to the star (\\textit{i.e.} $r \\lesssim 1-2$ AU)\nor a sequence starting by a vaporization or a melting and finishing by a re-condensation.\nBesides this, comets are presumed to have formed in the cold outer part of the solar Nebula along the lines of the scenario recalled\nbelow.\\\\\n\n  The dissipation of the early gaseous and dusty protoplanetary disk is presumed to have left a disk of icy planetesimals beyond\n$\\sim 5$ AU. The Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt (hereafter KB) and the Oort Cloud (hereafter OC) are the remains of this disk and are the well\naccepted two main cometary reservoirs \\citep[][]{mumma_charnley_2011}. A corpus of studies, based on dynamics, show that icy asteroids\noriginally located between $\\sim 5$ AU and $\\sim 30$ AU have either participated to the formation of giant planets or have\nbeen ejected far away because of the planet migration. The majority of the KB objects have probably been accreted at their current\ndistances (\\textit{i.e.} $\\gtrsim 30$ AU); but as suggested by results of the Nice model, an orbital resonance of Saturn and Jupiter\nmay have partially filled the KB with objects initially located between $\\sim 15$ AU and $\\sim 30$ AU \\citep[][]{tsiganis_etal_2005}.\nFurthermore, the planetesimals of the inner part of the primordial disk (\\textit{i.e.} located in the interval $\\sim 5-15$ AU)\nhave been likely ejected and finally participated to the formation of the outer regions of the KB and the OC. In summary, the crystals\nhave been incorporated into icy planetesimals when they occupied zones from $\\sim 5$ AU to $\\sim  30$ AU and beyond; prior to be\nscattered to the KB and OC. Of course, the transport processes studied in this paper should deposit crystalline dusts at least around\n$5$ AU, but the deeper the penetration beyond $5$ AU will be, the more credible the proposed mechanism will be.\n    The formation of the comets is also believed to have occurred early during the solar system\nformation. For instance \\cite{weidenschilling_1997} showed that the formation of comets could have been completed in $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{5}$\nyears.\\\\\n\n\\cite{campins_ryan_1989} have found that crystalline \nolivine is a major component of the silicates in Comet Halley and \\cite{wooden_etal_1999,wooden_etal_2000} detected crystalline\nsilicates in Hale-Bopp observations. \\textit{Stardust} samples of Comet 81P/Wild 2 include large single mineral crystals\nand X-ray microscopic analysis leads to a crystal mass fraction $f_{\\rm cryst}$ larger than $\\sim 50$\\% \n\\citep[][]{zolensky_etla_2006,ogliore_etal_2009,brownlee_etal_2006}. More generally, comets have a ratio $f_{\\rm cryst}$ exceeding $\\sim 20$\\% \n\\cite[][]{kelley_wooden_2009,lindsay_etal_2013}.\nThis discrepancy between the  \ncrystallinity of the ISM grains and the of cometary grains one is the mark of a radial \ntransport process and/or a specific physical phenomenon occurring\nin the accretion disk. Several transport processes have been proposed to explain the presence of these refractory material in comets:\nannealing by shock waves in the outer solar Nebula \\citep[][]{harker_desch_2002}, radial mixing by turbulent\ndiffusion \\citep[][]{gail_2001,wehrstedt_gail_2002,bockeleeMorvan_etal_2002,cuzzi_etla_2003} or mixing in a marginally gravitationally unstable\n(MGU) disk \\citep[see the series of papers by Boss and co-authors: ][could be a starting point]{boss_2008}, transport by photophoresis \n\\citep[][]{krauss_wurm_2005,wurm_krauss_2006,krauss_etal_2007,mousis_etal_2007,moudens_etal_2011}. \nSome authors \\citep[][]{ciesla_2007,keller_gail_2004} built models including the vertical disk structure and found a radial outflow of dust grains due to pressure gradients\nwithin the protoplanetary disk.\nThe X-wind mechanism, which has been advocated for the redistribution\nof CAIs throughout the Nebula \\citep[][]{shu_etal_1996}, could have also brought a contribution.\\\\\n\nIn this paper, we focus on photophoretic process for which we employ a 1+1D accretion disk undergoing a time-dependent irradiation. Indeed,\nthe proto-Sun, at the epoch during which it was surrounded by a disk of gas and dust, was evolving through the so-called T Tauri phase. The stars\nbelonging  to the T Tauri class, are known to possess an accretion disk and are evolving along the Pre-Main Sequence (hereafter PMS) tracks\nwhere their luminosity could be much higher than \nthat of the Sun. This high luminosity could have an important influence\non photophoresis and might change the disk structure or its dynamics by irradiation. This is why we were interested in modeling an accretion disk evolving consistently \nwith a proto-Sun. It is of particular interest to assess if the assumption of the existence of a central gap \n\\citep[as hypothesized in previous works, see ][]{moudens_etal_2011} in the disk is still required. It should be noticed that\n\\cite{turner_etal_2012} have taken into account the PMS luminosity of the proto-Sun in the context of Jupiter formation.\\\\\n\n  The presence of crystals in comets is not the only issue for which photophoresis is supposed to play a role, \n\\cite{teiser_dodsonrobinson2013} have proposed that photophoresis could accelerate the giant planets formation and\n\\cite{wurm_etal_2013} have investigated the involvement of this effect in the formation of Mercury-like planets and in the metal depletion in\nchondrites. Detailed theoretical and experimental studies on chondrules photophoretic properties have been also conducted\n \\citep[][]{wurm_etal_2010,loesche_etal_2013a}.\\\\\n\n   Concerning the photophoretic transport itself we have essentially adopted the approach described in \\cite{krauss_etal_2007}\nand \\cite{moudens_etal_2011}, as recalled in Sec.~\\ref{model}. The main features of our disk model are presented in the same\nsection, and additional details are given in \\ref{append}.\nSection \\ref{res} is devoted to our results, while in\nSect.~\\ref{discu} we discuss some aspects of the problem such as the influence of aggregate properties, in particular that of\nthermal conductivity as suggested by \\cite{krauss_etal_2007}, {{and the role of gas--dust opacity}}.\nConclusions can be found in Sect.~\\ref{concl}.\n\n\n\\section{\\label{model}Description of the model}\n\n   We have developed an original implementation of a 1+1D irradiated protoplanetary accretion disk model based on the \nequation introduced by \\cite{lynden-Bell_Pringle_1974} and \\cite{pringle_1981}\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{Eq_evol}\n \\frac{\\partial\\Sigma}{\\partial t} = \\frac{3}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left\\{r^{1/2} \n                                     \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}<\\nu> \\Sigma r^{1/2}\\right\\}\n         + \\dot{\\Sigma}_{w}( r)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\partial\\Sigma}{\\partial t}=\\frac{3}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left%&#10;\\{r^{1/2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}&lt;\\nu&gt;\\Sigma r^{1/2}\\right\\}+\\dot{\\Sigma}_{%&#10;w}(r)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a3</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mi>r</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mo>\u2202</mo><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mo>\u2202</mo><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo>&gt;</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>}</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a3</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mi>w</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02144.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nwhere $R_{\\star}(t)$ and $T_{eff}(t)$ are respectively the stellar radius and effective temperature at the age $t$; \n$H_{p}(t)$ represents the disk pressure height at the heliocentric distance $r$ and at time\n$t$. This prescription has also been adopted by \\cite{fouchet_etal_2012} who have emphasized its significance that we recall here:\nthe term (1) corresponds to the radiative flux that would be intercepted by a flat disk, the term (2) is an estimation for the effect\nof the disk flaring. Following \\cite{fouchet_etal_2012} and \\cite{hueso_guillot_2005} we fixed\n$\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln} H_{p}/\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln} r$ at its equilibrium value, namely $9/7$.\n\n  In order to validate our model, we have performed several tests. For instance, we have verified that we reproduce \nthe mid-plane temperature $T_{m}$, the surface density $\\Sigma$ and the shape factor $H/r$ obtained by PT99 (see e.g. Figs. 2 and 3 in PT99).\n\nWe also obtained a good agreement between our computations and the PT99 ones for the accretion rate\n $\\dot{M}_{st}$ (M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) as a \nfunction of $\\Sigma$ for various turbulence parameters $\\alpha$ and distances $r$ to the Sun. In their study, PT99 did not take into\naccount the effect of irradiation. Notice that, this is why we verified that our computations are compatible with results found by \n\\cite{dalessio_etal_1998}, even if the treatment of the irradiation is not exactly the same. \nThis way, following the same procedure adopted by \\cite{fouchet_etal_2012}, we also verified that  our computations are compatible with \nresults found by \\cite{dalessio_etal_1998}, who used a more sophisticated approach concerning irradiation.\\\\\n\n  Both stars and protoplanetary disks change with time. The stars evolve under the influence of gravitation and nuclear\nreactions, while disks lose their mass either by accreting on the star and/or evaporating to the interstellar space. \nThus, we have decided to include both evolutions in a model in which the proto-Sun and the disk interact via irradiation.\\\\ \n\n  Young Main Sequence stars may exhibit a debris disk, that has a very tenuous or even non-existent gaseous component \n\\citep{ollivier_etal_2009}. In contrast, T Tauri stars have their spectroscopic features (as the excess UV or IR radiation) well\nexplained by the presence of a surrounding, optically thick, gaseous accretion disk \\citep{lynden-Bell_Pringle_1974}. The objects of this\nclass are Pre-Main Sequence stars, located in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram  between the\n``birthline'' and the early Main Sequence, \nwhere the stellar luminosity is provided by the hydrogen burning in their core with the secondary elements at equilibrium.\nThe ``birthline'' is a line in the \nHR diagram corresponding to a threshold below which stars become visible to the observer, they therefore begin their quasi-static contraction \nand move to the Main Sequence. We have adopted a PMS evolutionary track computed by \\cite{tognelli_etal_2011} who have employed \nthe well-tested and developed stellar evolutionary code FRANEC\\footnote{Frascati Raphson Newton Evolutionary Code.}\n\\citep[][]{deglinnocenti_etal_2008}\ntogether with up-to-date input physics \\cite[][]{tognelli_etal_2012,dellomodarme_etal_2012}.\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\hspace{-0.5cm}\\includegraphics[width=10.5 cm]{PMS_track_4.eps}\n\\caption[]{\\label{PMS}Solid line: Pre-Main sequence evolutionary track computed by \\cite{tognelli_etal_2011}, chosen\n           parameters are representative for the Sun: $Z= 0.01377$ and $Y=0.2533$ are respectively the initial heavy elements and\n           the helium mass fractions, $\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}= 1.68$ is the solar calibrated Mixing Length Theory parameter and $X_{\\rm D}$ \n           denotes the initial mass fraction of deuterium.

We used an iterative procedure that consists in varying the initial helium abundance ($Y$), \nmetallicity ($Z$), and mixing length parameter ($\\alpha_{MLT}$), in order to reproduce at the age of the Sun ($t_\\odot$) the present \n$L_\\odot$, $R_\\odot$, and $(Z/X)_{ph,\\odot}$ within a tolerance of, at most, $10^{-4}$. Then, we obtained for the proto-Sun the initial \nhelium and metal mass fraction $Y = 0.2533$, $Z = 0.01377$, and $\\alpha_{MLT}=1.68$ (see Fig.~\\ref{PMS}).  \n\nIn their study  of samples of stars belonging to six young stellar clusters, \\cite{haisch_etal_2001} have measured the JHKL\n infrared excess fractions of stars. For each cluster, these ratios can be regarded as the fractions of stars\nsurrounded by a disk. For the selected  clusters, age determinations are available in the literature. This way,\n\\cite{haisch_etal_2001} have shown that, not surprisingly, the fraction of stars accompanied by a disk decreases with age and should\nbe negligible for an age around $\\sim 6$ Myr (hereafter 1 Myr$= 10^{6}$ years). This limitation is confirmed by \\cite{pascucci_tachibana_2010}\nand references therein.\nAccording to these works, protoplanetary \ndisks older than $\\sim 6$ Myr should not exist or be very rare. \nOur 1+1D disk model requires the pre-computation of tables of turbulent viscosity $<\\nu>$ depending on various parameters among which\nthe luminosity of the star $L_{\\star}$ and its effective temperature $T_{eff}$. \nConsequently, along the PMS track we took a set of couples $(L_{\\star},T_{eff})$ corresponding to ages $t \\lesssim 16$ Myr\nwith $t=0$ at the ``birthline''. Hence, for each $t$, tables of mean viscosity were constructed using $(L_{\\star}(t), T_{eff}(t))$ or\nequivalently $(R_{\\star}(t),T_{eff}(t))$ and playing with a set of parameters values: $\\alpha= 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$; $\\dot{M}_{st}$ ranging\nfrom $10^{-12} \\, M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-4}\\, M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$; and $0.05 \\le r\\le 50$ AU.

This way, the temperature at this surface, denoted $T_{s}$, is given by \n$T_{s}^{4}= T_{b}^{4} + T_{irr}^{4}$ where $T_{b}$ is the background temperature (usually $T_{b}= 10$ K) and $T_{irr}$ comes from \nthe following equation, derived in \\cite{hueso_guillot_2005},\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{Tirr}\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n T_{irr} &=& T_{eff}(t)  \\left[ \\underbrace{\\frac{{\\displaystyle} 2}{{\\displaystyle} 3\\pi} \\, \\left( \\frac{{\\displaystyle} R_{\\star}(t)}{{\\displaystyle} r} \\right)^{3}}_{(1)}\\right. \\\\\n         & + & \\left.\\underbrace{\\frac{{\\displaystyle} 1}{{\\displaystyle} 2} \\left(\\frac{{\\displaystyle} R_{\\star}(t)}{{\\displaystyle} r}\\right)^{2}\n            \\left(\\frac{{\\displaystyle} H_{p}(t)}{{\\displaystyle} r}\\right)\n            \\left(\\frac{{\\displaystyle} \\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln} \\, H_{p}(t)}{{\\displaystyle}\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln} \\, r}-1\\right)\n            }_{(2)}\n                         \\right]^{1/4} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\begin{array}[]{lcl}T_{irr}&amp;=&amp;T_{eff}(t)\\left[\\underbrace{\\frac{{\\displaystyle%&#10;}2}{{\\displaystyle}3\\pi}\\,\\left(\\frac{{\\displaystyle}R_{\\star}(t)}{{%&#10;\\displaystyle}r}\\right)^{3}}_{(1)}\\right.\\\\&#10;&amp;+&amp;\\left.\\underbrace{\\frac{{\\displaystyle}1}{{\\displaystyle}2}\\left(\\frac{{%&#10;\\displaystyle}R_{\\star}(t)}{{\\displaystyle}r}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\frac{{%&#10;\\displaystyle}H_{p}(t)}{{\\displaystyle}r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{{\\displaystyle}%&#10;\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln}\\,H_{p}(t)}{{\\displaystyle}\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln}\\,r}-1%&#10;\\right)}_{(2)}\\right]^{1/4}\\\\&#10;\\end{array}\" display=\"block\"><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><munder><munder accentunder=\"true\"><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></mfrac></mpadded><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u22c6</mo></msub><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>r</mi></mfrac><mo movablelimits=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u23df</mo></munder><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></munder></mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd/><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mo>+</mo></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><munder><munder accentunder=\"true\"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u22c6</mo></msub><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>r</mi></mfrac><mo movablelimits=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>r</mi></mfrac><mo movablelimits=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>dln</mi></mpadded><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>dln</mi></mpadded><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo movablelimits=\"false\">-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">\u23df</mo></munder><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></munder><mo>]</mo><msup><mi/><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02144.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n We are not going to recall the expression of each term of Eq.

This prescription has also been adopted by \\cite{fouchet_etal_2012} who have emphasized its significance that we recall here:\nthe term (1) corresponds to the radiative flux that would be intercepted by a flat disk, the term (2) is an estimation for the effect\nof the disk flaring. Following \\cite{fouchet_etal_2012} and \\cite{hueso_guillot_2005} we fixed\n$\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln} H_{p}/\\mathrm{d}\\mathrm{ln} r$ at its equilibrium value, namely $9/7$.\n\n  In order to validate our model, we have performed several tests. For instance, we have verified that we reproduce \nthe mid-plane temperature $T_{m}$, the surface density $\\Sigma$ and the shape factor $H/r$ obtained by PT99 (see e.g. Figs. 2 and 3 in PT99).\n\nWe also obtained a good agreement between our computations and the PT99 ones for the accretion rate\n $\\dot{M}_{st}$ (M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) as a \nfunction of $\\Sigma$ for various turbulence parameters $\\alpha$ and distances $r$ to the Sun. In their study, PT99 did not take into\naccount the effect of irradiation. Notice that, this is why we verified that our computations are compatible with results found by \n\\cite{dalessio_etal_1998}, even if the treatment of the irradiation is not exactly the same. \nThis way, following the same procedure adopted by \\cite{fouchet_etal_2012}, we also verified that  our computations are compatible with \nresults found by \\cite{dalessio_etal_1998}, who used a more sophisticated approach concerning irradiation.\\\\\n\n  Both stars and protoplanetary disks change with time. The stars evolve under the influence of gravitation and nuclear\nreactions, while disks lose their mass either by accreting on the star and/or evaporating to the interstellar space. \nThus, we have decided to include both evolutions in a model in which the proto-Sun and the disk interact via irradiation.\\\\ \n\n  Young Main Sequence stars may exhibit a debris disk, that has a very tenuous or even non-existent gaseous component \n\\citep{ollivier_etal_2009}. In contrast, T Tauri stars have their spectroscopic features (as the excess UV or IR radiation) well\nexplained by the presence of a surrounding, optically thick, gaseous accretion disk \\citep{lynden-Bell_Pringle_1974}. The objects of this\nclass are Pre-Main Sequence stars, located in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram  between the\n``birthline'' and the early Main Sequence, \nwhere the stellar luminosity is provided by the hydrogen burning in their core with the secondary elements at equilibrium.\nThe ``birthline'' is a line in the \nHR diagram corresponding to a threshold below which stars become visible to the observer, they therefore begin their quasi-static contraction \nand move to the Main Sequence. We have adopted a PMS evolutionary track computed by \\cite{tognelli_etal_2011} who have employed \nthe well-tested and developed stellar evolutionary code FRANEC\\footnote{Frascati Raphson Newton Evolutionary Code.}\n\\citep[][]{deglinnocenti_etal_2008}\ntogether with up-to-date input physics \\cite[][]{tognelli_etal_2012,dellomodarme_etal_2012}.\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\vspace{-1cm}\n\\hspace{-0.5cm}\\includegraphics[width=10.5 cm]{PMS_track_4.eps}\n\\caption[]{\\label{PMS}Solid line: Pre-Main sequence evolutionary track computed by \\cite{tognelli_etal_2011}, chosen\n           parameters are representative for the Sun: $Z= 0.01377$ and $Y=0.2533$ are respectively the initial heavy elements and\n           the helium mass fractions, $\\alpha_{\\rm MLT}= 1.68$ is the solar calibrated Mixing Length Theory parameter and $X_{\\rm D}$ \n           denotes the initial mass fraction of deuterium.

We used an iterative procedure that consists in varying the initial helium abundance ($Y$), \nmetallicity ($Z$), and mixing length parameter ($\\alpha_{MLT}$), in order to reproduce at the age of the Sun ($t_\\odot$) the present \n$L_\\odot$, $R_\\odot$, and $(Z/X)_{ph,\\odot}$ within a tolerance of, at most, $10^{-4}$. Then, we obtained for the proto-Sun the initial \nhelium and metal mass fraction $Y = 0.2533$, $Z = 0.01377$, and $\\alpha_{MLT}=1.68$ (see Fig.~\\ref{PMS}).  \n\nIn their study  of samples of stars belonging to six young stellar clusters, \\cite{haisch_etal_2001} have measured the JHKL\n infrared excess fractions of stars. For each cluster, these ratios can be regarded as the fractions of stars\nsurrounded by a disk. For the selected  clusters, age determinations are available in the literature. This way,\n\\cite{haisch_etal_2001} have shown that, not surprisingly, the fraction of stars accompanied by a disk decreases with age and should\nbe negligible for an age around $\\sim 6$ Myr (hereafter 1 Myr$= 10^{6}$ years). This limitation is confirmed by \\cite{pascucci_tachibana_2010}\nand references therein.\nAccording to these works, protoplanetary \ndisks older than $\\sim 6$ Myr should not exist or be very rare. \nOur 1+1D disk model requires the pre-computation of tables of turbulent viscosity $<\\nu>$ depending on various parameters among which\nthe luminosity of the star $L_{\\star}$ and its effective temperature $T_{eff}$. \nConsequently, along the PMS track we took a set of couples $(L_{\\star},T_{eff})$ corresponding to ages $t \\lesssim 16$ Myr\nwith $t=0$ at the ``birthline''. Hence, for each $t$, tables of mean viscosity were constructed using $(L_{\\star}(t), T_{eff}(t))$ or\nequivalently $(R_{\\star}(t),T_{eff}(t))$ and playing with a set of parameters values: $\\alpha= 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$; $\\dot{M}_{st}$ ranging\nfrom $10^{-12} \\, M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-4}\\, M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$; and $0.05 \\le r\\le 50$ AU.

This strong hypothesis, already made by \\cite{mousis_etal_2007} and \\cite{moudens_etal_2011}, favors clearly\nthe transport driven by photophoresis since it decreases the radiative flux attenuation between the proto-Sun and the dust grains.\\\\\n\nThe results of our first calculations can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}(a), they are very similar to those\nplotted in Fig. 4 of \\cite{moudens_etal_2011}; for which equivalent parameters and hypothesis have been chosen. We recall that, in this case,\nthe lifetime of the protoplanetary disk has been adjusted to $6$ Myr \\citep[see][]{haisch_etal_2001,pascucci_tachibana_2010} by tuning the photoevaporation\nparameter $\\lambda_{\\rm evap}$. In Moudens \\textit{et al.}'s work the disk is not irradiated, and the solar luminosity was provided by \\cite{pietrinferni_etal_2004}\nfor the Sun at the ZAMS\\footnote{Zero Age Main Sequence.}. For each simulation of a disk evolution, we stopped the calculation when\nthe total mass of the disk reached $\\sim 1$\\% of its initial mass.\nThis criterion will\nbe applied in all simulations discussed in the rest of the present work.\\\\\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}(b) an identical disk\nstructure is kept but the photophoresis force is computed in a slightly different way: the solar luminosity is no longer taken \nconstant at its ZAMS value, but instead it follows the luminosity variations along the PMS tracks plotted in Fig.~\\ref{PMS}. \n\nIn addition,\nthe gas opacity which depends on the stellar effective temperature $T_{eff}$ (see Eq. \\ref{kappaR}), is computed consistently. \nNot surprisingly, the aggregates are very efficiently pushed outwards, \nbecause the luminosity at the birthline is about $10$ times larger than that at the ZAMS.\nInterestingly, particles with a radius of $a= 10^{-5}$ m reach \n$\\sim 10$ AU after $\\sim 0.3$ Myr and do not move further away even after $6$ Myr.\\\\\n\n  Keeping fixed the inner gap at $2$ AU, and letting unchanged all the other parameters, we adopted a protoplanetary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\hspace{-0.50cm}\\includegraphics[angle=-90, width=20cm]{Fig1_paper_5.ps}\n\\caption[]{\\label{firstresults} In this figure we have displayed the heliocentric distance $r_{p}$ (AU) reached by aggregates \n           of differents radius $a$ ranging from $10^{-5}$ m to $10^{-1}$ m, as a function of time $t$ (Myr).

This behavior could be caused either by a higher accretion velocity or by smaller forces.\n\nIn order to disentangle the various effects, we have focused our analysis on the movement of particles of radius $10^{-4}$ m, \nwhich appear to be typical at the examination of Fig.~\\ref{firstresults} (b) and Fig.~\\ref{firstresults} (c). The panel (a)\nof Fig.~\\ref{expla} indicates that the accretion velocity undergone by the considered particle, along its path in the disk mid-plane,\nis larger (in absolute value) when the disk structure is irradiated. Beside this, we have checked that during the period of\ninterest, \\textit{i.e.} before $\\sim 1.5$ Myr, the photophoretic force has the dominant contribution to the drift velocity (see Eq.~\\ref{Vdrift}).\nTo catch the effect of the disk structure, we have normalized the photophoretic force by the received flux of light (see Eq. \\ref{phforce}).\nThe resulting ratio $F_{ph}/I$ is either not significantly different or slightly higher,\nrespectively when irradiation is accounted or when it is not (see Fig.~\\ref{expla}.b). Therefore, the larger accretion velocity  \nappears to weaken the efficiency of the photophoretic force during the T Tauri phase of the Sun.\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n\\caption[]{Lifetimes (in Myr) of the disk model as a function of the initial mass (in MMSN) and the turbulent mixing parameter $\\alpha$.\n           All these simulations were performed without photoevaporation but they include the time-dependent irradiation by the \n           PMS Sun.}\n\\begin{center}\n{\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\hline\n                &           &                     &   $\\alpha$         &                    &                    &           \\\\\n\\hline\nMass  (in MMSN) & $10^{-3}$ &  $2 \\times 10^{-3}$ & $4 \\times 10^{-3}$ & $6 \\times 10^{-3}$ & $8 \\times 10^{-3}$ & $10^{-2}$ \\\\\n\\hline\n   1            & 16.4      &   10.7              & 7.9                &  5.8               & 4.0                & 3.0       \\\\\n   3            & 15.7      &   10.4              & 7.7                &  5.3               & 3.7                & 2.8       \\\\ \n  10            & 15.1      &   10.0              & 7.4                &  4.8               & 3.3                & 2.5       \\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\label{dissiptime}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\nWe emphasized that this irradiated disk model is dissipated at the age of $4.32$ Myr.

As it could be\nexpected (see Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}. d), the distances $r_{p}$ are in average lower than those computed\nin the previous case where $r_{\\rm gap}= 2$ AU, this is clearly the consequence of a stronger light absorption along the line of sight:\nsince the difference $r_{p}-r_{\\rm gap}$ (see Fig.~\\ref{sketch}) is larger, the flux of photons received by a given aggregate becomes fainter, \nthus producing weaker photophoretic and radiative forces. Remarkably, dust particles with radius larger than $10^{-4}$ m can be found up to \n$20$--$30$ AU from the proto-Sun and consequently could participate to the formation of icy planetesimals within the KB.\\\\\n\n  In Tab.~\\ref{influMMSN} we have gathered the maximum distances reached by dust aggregates when the initial mass of the Nebula ranges\nbetween 1 MMSN and 10 MMSN. Clearly, a low mass Nebula favors large distances for small particles. We would like to stress \nthat this is not only because small particles ($\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-5}$ m) get to outer regions that larger aggregates could not be \nfound in cometary material:\nindeed aggregation/coagulation processes could form relatively big grains using small ones as building blocks\n\\citep[][]{guttler_etal_2010,zsom_etal_2010,blum_etal_2014}. \nAlternatively, the opposite process could occur: fragmentation could produce small particles from relatively large ones.\\\\\n\nWe have also performed irradiated\ndisk simulations with $\\alpha= 10^{-2}$ and $\\alpha= 10^{-3}$; limiting --when necessary-- the age to $6$ Myr, by adjusting the \nphotoevaporation parameter. The results were essentially similar to those obtained at $\\alpha= 7 \\times 10^{-3}$ (displayed in\nTab.~\\ref{influMMSN}).\\\\\n\n    The inner limit of the disk structure (\\textit{i.e.} the above mentioned $0.5$ AU) may appear somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, even\nin the case of T Tauri stars which have not developed an extended inner hole (\\textit{i.e.} up to distances of several AU) the accretion\ndisk is truncated in the vicinity of the star. Indeed, T Tauri stars are known to be magnetically very active; \\textit{e.g.}, Zeeman \nbroadening measurements have revealed surface field in the range of $1-3$ kG. Such strong magnetic fields are at the origin of ``jets''\nthat eject material to the interstellar medium, and also produce a magnetospheric accretion in which the disk matter is channeled\nonto the star along magnetic field lines \\cite[][]{ferreira_etal_2006,bouvier_etal_2007} out of the mid-plane, leaving it optically\nthin. Although, this quantity is the subject of star-to-star substantial variations, the radius of this magnetospheric accretion zone\ncan be reasonably estimated to be around $\\sim 0.1$ AU. We, then, computed a specific set of evolving\ndisk structures using $r_{\\rm gap}= 0.10$ AU. Keeping other parameters unchanged compared to those used for the simulations reported\nin Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}(d), we obtained only aggregates with radius of $a= 10^{-3}$ m and $a= 10^{-2}$ m reaching heliocentric distances\nslightly larger than $\\sim 6$ AU while the other dust particles remain closer to the star within $5$ AU. These outputs shows, one more time, that \nthe existence of an inner hole, optically thin and having an expansion beyond $\\sim 0.5$ AU, is a determining factor for the efficiency \nof the photophoretic transport of dust in protoplanetary disks.\n\n\n\\section{\\label{discu}Discussion}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Kinetics of the Grains Annealing in an Irradiated Disk}\n\n  The problem of the existence of crystals in comets raises naturally the question of the kinetics of thermal annealing of silicate\ngrains that originate from the interstellar medium. Indeed, this lattice structure transformation cannot be instantaneous; in addition, one\ncan wonder if grains at relatively low temperature could be annealed in timescale compatible with disk lifetime. If the process could\noccur at large heliocentric distances with a duration $\\lesssim 6$ Myr, then the transport of grain from regions in the\nvicinity of the proto-Sun, to larger distances would be no longer needed. \\cite{lenzuni_etal_1995} gave the typical duration $t$\nfor converting an amorphous domain to a crystalline domain: $t = \\nu^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{e}^{D/k_{B} T_{a}}$, where $\\nu$ is the \ncharacteristic vibrational frequency of silicate, $D$ is the activation energy of repositioning atoms within the lattice structure,\n$T_{a}$ the temperature and $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann's constant. \\cite{lenzuni_etal_1995} gave also the\ntypical values $\\nu \\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ and $D/k_{B} \\sim 41000$ K, which leads to $t \\sim 5$ Myr for $T_{a}= 645$ K and\n$23$ Myr for $T_{a}= 630$ K. We have checked in our models of irradiated disks that the mid-plane temperature $T_{m}$ remains always\nbelow $\\sim 100$ K disk life-long for distances larger than a few AU. As a consequence, amorphous grains cannot be annealed, by gas temperature,\nat distances compatible with comets\nformation during the disk lifetime, even if the disk is irradiated. Concerning the production of crystals by vaporization/recondensation,\nthe temperatures required to vaporized silicates ({\\it i.e.} $T \\le 1500$ K) are never reached in our models in the external Solar System.\n{{As a consequence, the remaining possibility is an evaporation/condensation sequence in high temperature regions --{\\it i.e.} those close to the proto-Sun-- during the early phases of the disk evolution.}}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{influ_rhop}The influence of monomers density}\n\n   In this work, each dust particle is an agglomerate of smaller grains. In real accretion disks, these ``elementary grains'' may\nshow a distribution in size, shape and composition. Here, like in previous ones, the aggregates have been represented by\na radius ({\\it i.e}. a typical size), a thermal conductivity (whose influence is discussed in Sect.~\\ref{influ_conducti}) and a density\nthat determines the mass of each aggregate. This density is a function of the assumed aggregate porosity and of the average density\nof monomers. \\cite{blum_schrapler_2004} conducted laboratory experiments consisting of random ballistic deposition of monodisperse \nSiO$_2$ spheres with $1.5$ $\\mu$m diameter and found an --already mentioned-- volume filling factor of $0.15$. More recently,\n\\cite{zsom_etal_2010} using sophisticated Monte-Carlo simulations, based on a detailed modelization of collisions, derived filling \nfactors around $0.30$. This leads to a higher dust particle density, of the order of $1000$ kg m$^{-3}$ rather than $500$ kg m$^{-3}$\npreviously employed. By replacing $500$ kg m$^{-3}$ with $1000$ kg m$^{-3}$, for a non-irradiated model of an intial mass of $3$ MMSN\nand evolving for $6$ Myr (this model is comparable to the one plotted in Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}.(a) {{which has been computed taking $500$ kg m$^{-3}$}}) we obtained a maximum distance reached by aggregates that decreases, due to the larger inertia of particles. \nNot surprinsingly, a dependence with respect to the dust particle size {{has been found}}: \nthe larger the particle is (\\textit{i.e.} large radius $a$), and the lower is the maximum distance reached. For instance, for \nradii $a$ in the range $10^{-1}$--$10^{-2}$ m the distance reduction is of the order of $15$\\%, while it falls to $\\sim 10$\\% for $a= 10^{-3}$\nm, and becomes negligible for $a= 10^{-5}$ m. Compared to the other sources of uncertainties, particularly those regarding the\nactual thermal conductivity of aggregates, the effect of dust {{monomer density does not appear to be the dominant one ({\\it i.e.} when replacing our fiducial value of $500$ kg m$^{-3}$ by $1000$ kg m$^{-3}$)}}.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{influ_conducti}The influence of thermal conductivity and porosity of aggregates}\n\n     The thermal conductivity of aggregates $\\lambda_{p}$ remains poorly constrained, and \ncould depend on many parameters: the temperature, the exact nature of the bulk material, the porosity, the shape and the size distribution of the\nmonomers, the number and the size of contact areas between monomers, the lattice structure of the monomers, etc. The heat\nconductivity is a crucial quantity in the context\nof photophoresis: high values should diminish the effect of photophoresis because they facilitate the uniformization of the\ntemperature over the ``surface'' of each particle. In contrast to this, if aggregates are bad thermal conductors the photophoretic\neffect is expected to be very efficient. \n    So far, we used the value $\\lambda_{p}= 10^{-3}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ which is the same \nadopted by \\cite{mousis_etal_2007} and \\cite{moudens_etal_2011}; although this is an extreme value, it has been adopted by these authors \nwithout any well referenced justification. Surprisingly, \\cite{krauss_etal_2007} \n\\citep[who have several authors in common with][]{mousis_etal_2007,moudens_etal_2011} have worked with $\\lambda_{p}= 10^{-2}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\nand have suggested that the precise influence of $\\lambda_{p}$ should be explored. The value used by \\cite{krauss_etal_2007} \ncomes from \\cite{presley_christensen_1997} who have not reported value as low as $10^{-3}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for relevant materials.\nIn addition, \\cite{vonBorstel_blum_2012}, who found thermal conductivities around $10^{-1}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, mentioned that\nresults published by \\cite{moudens_etal_2011} should be quantitatively affected by a higher heat conductivity. \nFor all these reasons, detailed investigations about the importance of thermal conductivity \nare needed.\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \\cite{krause_etal_2011} conducted laboratory experiments with aggregate analogs composed by monodisperse spherical monomers.\nTheir samples of 1.5 $\\mu$m-sized SiO$_2$ particles were prepared following several specific protocoles which led to various values\nof the porosity. This way, \\cite{krause_etal_2011} obtained a range of thermal conductivity that lies between\n$0.002$--$0.02$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. \\cite{gundlach_blum_2012}, in their work on the heat transport in porous \nsurface dust layers, found values compatible with such a range. \nWe should notice that the lowest value of \\cite{gundlach_blum_2012}, \n\\textit{i.e.} $0.002$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, is close the one that we have used. For an irradiated disk\nmodel of $3$ MMSN computed with $\\alpha= 7 \\times 10^{-3}$, the use of $\\lambda_{p}= 0.02$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ yields to a \nmaximum heliocentric distance reached by particles around $10$ AU (corresponding to $a= 10^{-2}$ m).

For each simulation of a disk evolution, we stopped the calculation when\nthe total mass of the disk reached $\\sim 1$\\% of its initial mass.\nThis criterion will\nbe applied in all simulations discussed in the rest of the present work.\\\\\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}(b) an identical disk\nstructure is kept but the photophoresis force is computed in a slightly different way: the solar luminosity is no longer taken \nconstant at its ZAMS value, but instead it follows the luminosity variations along the PMS tracks plotted in Fig.~\\ref{PMS}. \n\nIn addition,\nthe gas opacity which depends on the stellar effective temperature $T_{eff}$ (see Eq. \\ref{kappaR}), is computed consistently. \nNot surprisingly, the aggregates are very efficiently pushed outwards, \nbecause the luminosity at the birthline is about $10$ times larger than that at the ZAMS.\nInterestingly, particles with a radius of $a= 10^{-5}$ m reach \n$\\sim 10$ AU after $\\sim 0.3$ Myr and do not move further away even after $6$ Myr.\\\\\n\n  Keeping fixed the inner gap at $2$ AU, and letting unchanged all the other parameters, we adopted a protoplanetary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\hspace{-0.50cm}\\includegraphics[angle=-90, width=20cm]{Fig1_paper_5.ps}\n\\caption[]{\\label{firstresults} In this figure we have displayed the heliocentric distance $r_{p}$ (AU) reached by aggregates \n           of differents radius $a$ ranging from $10^{-5}$ m to $10^{-1}$ m, as a function of time $t$ (Myr).

The panel (a)\nof Fig.~\\ref{expla} indicates that the accretion velocity undergone by the considered particle, along its path in the disk mid-plane,\nis larger (in absolute value) when the disk structure is irradiated. Beside this, we have checked that during the period of\ninterest, \\textit{i.e.} before $\\sim 1.5$ Myr, the photophoretic force has the dominant contribution to the drift velocity (see Eq.~\\ref{Vdrift}).\nTo catch the effect of the disk structure, we have normalized the photophoretic force by the received flux of light (see Eq. \\ref{phforce}).\nThe resulting ratio $F_{ph}/I$ is either not significantly different or slightly higher,\nrespectively when irradiation is accounted or when it is not (see Fig.~\\ref{expla}.b).

As it could be\nexpected (see Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}. d), the distances $r_{p}$ are in average lower than those computed\nin the previous case where $r_{\\rm gap}= 2$ AU, this is clearly the consequence of a stronger light absorption along the line of sight:\nsince the difference $r_{p}-r_{\\rm gap}$ (see Fig.~\\ref{sketch}) is larger, the flux of photons received by a given aggregate becomes fainter, \nthus producing weaker photophoretic and radiative forces. Remarkably, dust particles with radius larger than $10^{-4}$ m can be found up to \n$20$--$30$ AU from the proto-Sun and consequently could participate to the formation of icy planetesimals within the KB.\\\\\n\n  In Tab.~\\ref{influMMSN} we have gathered the maximum distances reached by dust aggregates when the initial mass of the Nebula ranges\nbetween 1 MMSN and 10 MMSN. Clearly, a low mass Nebula favors large distances for small particles. We would like to stress \nthat this is not only because small particles ($\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-5}$ m) get to outer regions that larger aggregates could not be \nfound in cometary material:\nindeed aggregation/coagulation processes could form relatively big grains using small ones as building blocks\n\\citep[][]{guttler_etal_2010,zsom_etal_2010,blum_etal_2014}. \nAlternatively, the opposite process could occur: fragmentation could produce small particles from relatively large ones.\\\\\n\nWe have also performed irradiated\ndisk simulations with $\\alpha= 10^{-2}$ and $\\alpha= 10^{-3}$; limiting --when necessary-- the age to $6$ Myr, by adjusting the \nphotoevaporation parameter. The results were essentially similar to those obtained at $\\alpha= 7 \\times 10^{-3}$ (displayed in\nTab.~\\ref{influMMSN}).\\\\\n\n    The inner limit of the disk structure (\\textit{i.e.} the above mentioned $0.5$ AU) may appear somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, even\nin the case of T Tauri stars which have not developed an extended inner hole (\\textit{i.e.} up to distances of several AU) the accretion\ndisk is truncated in the vicinity of the star. Indeed, T Tauri stars are known to be magnetically very active; \\textit{e.g.}, Zeeman \nbroadening measurements have revealed surface field in the range of $1-3$ kG. Such strong magnetic fields are at the origin of ``jets''\nthat eject material to the interstellar medium, and also produce a magnetospheric accretion in which the disk matter is channeled\nonto the star along magnetic field lines \\cite[][]{ferreira_etal_2006,bouvier_etal_2007} out of the mid-plane, leaving it optically\nthin. Although, this quantity is the subject of star-to-star substantial variations, the radius of this magnetospheric accretion zone\ncan be reasonably estimated to be around $\\sim 0.1$ AU. We, then, computed a specific set of evolving\ndisk structures using $r_{\\rm gap}= 0.10$ AU. Keeping other parameters unchanged compared to those used for the simulations reported\nin Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}(d), we obtained only aggregates with radius of $a= 10^{-3}$ m and $a= 10^{-2}$ m reaching heliocentric distances\nslightly larger than $\\sim 6$ AU while the other dust particles remain closer to the star within $5$ AU. These outputs shows, one more time, that \nthe existence of an inner hole, optically thin and having an expansion beyond $\\sim 0.5$ AU, is a determining factor for the efficiency \nof the photophoretic transport of dust in protoplanetary disks.\n\n\n\\section{\\label{discu}Discussion}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Kinetics of the Grains Annealing in an Irradiated Disk}\n\n  The problem of the existence of crystals in comets raises naturally the question of the kinetics of thermal annealing of silicate\ngrains that originate from the interstellar medium. Indeed, this lattice structure transformation cannot be instantaneous; in addition, one\ncan wonder if grains at relatively low temperature could be annealed in timescale compatible with disk lifetime. If the process could\noccur at large heliocentric distances with a duration $\\lesssim 6$ Myr, then the transport of grain from regions in the\nvicinity of the proto-Sun, to larger distances would be no longer needed. \\cite{lenzuni_etal_1995} gave the typical duration $t$\nfor converting an amorphous domain to a crystalline domain: $t = \\nu^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{e}^{D/k_{B} T_{a}}$, where $\\nu$ is the \ncharacteristic vibrational frequency of silicate, $D$ is the activation energy of repositioning atoms within the lattice structure,\n$T_{a}$ the temperature and $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann's constant. \\cite{lenzuni_etal_1995} gave also the\ntypical values $\\nu \\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{13}$ s$^{-1}$ and $D/k_{B} \\sim 41000$ K, which leads to $t \\sim 5$ Myr for $T_{a}= 645$ K and\n$23$ Myr for $T_{a}= 630$ K. We have checked in our models of irradiated disks that the mid-plane temperature $T_{m}$ remains always\nbelow $\\sim 100$ K disk life-long for distances larger than a few AU. As a consequence, amorphous grains cannot be annealed, by gas temperature,\nat distances compatible with comets\nformation during the disk lifetime, even if the disk is irradiated. Concerning the production of crystals by vaporization/recondensation,\nthe temperatures required to vaporized silicates ({\\it i.e.} $T \\le 1500$ K) are never reached in our models in the external Solar System.\n{{As a consequence, the remaining possibility is an evaporation/condensation sequence in high temperature regions --{\\it i.e.} those close to the proto-Sun-- during the early phases of the disk evolution.}}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{influ_rhop}The influence of monomers density}\n\n   In this work, each dust particle is an agglomerate of smaller grains. In real accretion disks, these ``elementary grains'' may\nshow a distribution in size, shape and composition. Here, like in previous ones, the aggregates have been represented by\na radius ({\\it i.e}. a typical size), a thermal conductivity (whose influence is discussed in Sect.~\\ref{influ_conducti}) and a density\nthat determines the mass of each aggregate. This density is a function of the assumed aggregate porosity and of the average density\nof monomers. \\cite{blum_schrapler_2004} conducted laboratory experiments consisting of random ballistic deposition of monodisperse \nSiO$_2$ spheres with $1.5$ $\\mu$m diameter and found an --already mentioned-- volume filling factor of $0.15$. More recently,\n\\cite{zsom_etal_2010} using sophisticated Monte-Carlo simulations, based on a detailed modelization of collisions, derived filling \nfactors around $0.30$. This leads to a higher dust particle density, of the order of $1000$ kg m$^{-3}$ rather than $500$ kg m$^{-3}$\npreviously employed. By replacing $500$ kg m$^{-3}$ with $1000$ kg m$^{-3}$, for a non-irradiated model of an intial mass of $3$ MMSN\nand evolving for $6$ Myr (this model is comparable to the one plotted in Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}.(a) {{which has been computed taking $500$ kg m$^{-3}$}}) we obtained a maximum distance reached by aggregates that decreases, due to the larger inertia of particles. \nNot surprinsingly, a dependence with respect to the dust particle size {{has been found}}: \nthe larger the particle is (\\textit{i.e.} large radius $a$), and the lower is the maximum distance reached. For instance, for \nradii $a$ in the range $10^{-1}$--$10^{-2}$ m the distance reduction is of the order of $15$\\%, while it falls to $\\sim 10$\\% for $a= 10^{-3}$\nm, and becomes negligible for $a= 10^{-5}$ m. Compared to the other sources of uncertainties, particularly those regarding the\nactual thermal conductivity of aggregates, the effect of dust {{monomer density does not appear to be the dominant one ({\\it i.e.} when replacing our fiducial value of $500$ kg m$^{-3}$ by $1000$ kg m$^{-3}$)}}.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{influ_conducti}The influence of thermal conductivity and porosity of aggregates}\n\n     The thermal conductivity of aggregates $\\lambda_{p}$ remains poorly constrained, and \ncould depend on many parameters: the temperature, the exact nature of the bulk material, the porosity, the shape and the size distribution of the\nmonomers, the number and the size of contact areas between monomers, the lattice structure of the monomers, etc. The heat\nconductivity is a crucial quantity in the context\nof photophoresis: high values should diminish the effect of photophoresis because they facilitate the uniformization of the\ntemperature over the ``surface'' of each particle. In contrast to this, if aggregates are bad thermal conductors the photophoretic\neffect is expected to be very efficient. \n    So far, we used the value $\\lambda_{p}= 10^{-3}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ which is the same \nadopted by \\cite{mousis_etal_2007} and \\cite{moudens_etal_2011}; although this is an extreme value, it has been adopted by these authors \nwithout any well referenced justification. Surprisingly, \\cite{krauss_etal_2007} \n\\citep[who have several authors in common with][]{mousis_etal_2007,moudens_etal_2011} have worked with $\\lambda_{p}= 10^{-2}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$\nand have suggested that the precise influence of $\\lambda_{p}$ should be explored. The value used by \\cite{krauss_etal_2007} \ncomes from \\cite{presley_christensen_1997} who have not reported value as low as $10^{-3}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ for relevant materials.\nIn addition, \\cite{vonBorstel_blum_2012}, who found thermal conductivities around $10^{-1}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, mentioned that\nresults published by \\cite{moudens_etal_2011} should be quantitatively affected by a higher heat conductivity. \nFor all these reasons, detailed investigations about the importance of thermal conductivity \nare needed.\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \\cite{krause_etal_2011} conducted laboratory experiments with aggregate analogs composed by monodisperse spherical monomers.\nTheir samples of 1.5 $\\mu$m-sized SiO$_2$ particles were prepared following several specific protocoles which led to various values\nof the porosity. This way, \\cite{krause_etal_2011} obtained a range of thermal conductivity that lies between\n$0.002$--$0.02$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. \\cite{gundlach_blum_2012}, in their work on the heat transport in porous \nsurface dust layers, found values compatible with such a range. \nWe should notice that the lowest value of \\cite{gundlach_blum_2012}, \n\\textit{i.e.} $0.002$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, is close the one that we have used. For an irradiated disk\nmodel of $3$ MMSN computed with $\\alpha= 7 \\times 10^{-3}$, the use of $\\lambda_{p}= 0.02$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ yields to a \nmaximum heliocentric distance reached by particles around $10$ AU (corresponding to $a= 10^{-2}$ m). This result has to be compared\nto what it is depicted in Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}.d and thus illustrates the high sensitivity of photophoresis with respect to thermal\nconductivity.\\\\\n\n  \\cite{krause_etal_2011} were able to derive an empirical law providing the thermal conductivity of their analogs as a function of \nthe volume filling factor, or equivalently of the porosity $\\Pi$.

By doing this, we found a conductivity\naround $3.7$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. Thus, aggregates made of olivine could be expected to exhibit a higher heat conductivity than\nthose built from amorphous monomers of SiO$_2$.\\\\\n\n     All these arguments, together with the properties of \nthe turbulence do not support far migrations of dust particles, but favor transport by photophoresis limited to maximum distances between $\\sim 5$ AU and $\\sim 30$ AU \naccompanied by several segregation processes on porosity, chemical nature and size; processes which will be difficult to disentangle.\\\\\n\n   The emissivity $\\epsilon$ is also a thermodynamic parameter.

Decreasing the value of  $\\epsilon$ (we made test with $\\epsilon= 0.5$ and\n$\\epsilon= 0.1$) increases by a tiny amount the efficiency of photophoresis.\\\\\n\n   If thermal effects reduce or impede dust migration driven by photophoresis in the disk mid-plane, we could examine whether more\nfavorable conditions may be found within other zones of the Nebula.

For the computation of the trajectories, the employed prescription --also used in previous published works-- assumes the existence of the dust-free space between the inner boundary of the disk and the position of the ``test particles'' $r_p$ (see Fig.~\\ref{sketch}). This simplifying hypothesis allows the use of the opacity law given by Eq.~\\ref{kappaR} that accounts only for the gas Rayleigh's scattering, which is valid in the absence of dust grains. In observed accretion disk, as in the ISM, the populations of grains are not monodisperse but rather follow a size distribution \\citep[see for instance][and references therein]{apai_lauretta_2010}. As it has been noticed, the transport of the largest grains is faster than that of small particles, then some amount of small aggregates should remain along the line of sight between the Sun and the largest dust grains. Unfortunately, the small grains are the most numerous as the distribution of the grains size is believed to follow a powerlaw $a^{-n}$ with $n \\sim 3$, and consequently they produce a dominant contribution to the opacity. Indeed, in Fig.~\\ref{opacity_cuzzi_etal2014} one can compare the opacity laws \\citep{cuzzi_etal_2014} resulting from an aggregates sizes distribution spanning from $1$ to $10$ $\\mu$m and another with radii between $1$ $\\mu$m--$1$ cm. Clearly,  the population dominated by the smallest particles produces the highest opacity.\\\\   For our purpose, the relevant distribution in size is the one with radii between $1$ $\\mu$m--$1$ cm. As we can see in Fig.~\\ref{opacity_cuzzi_etal2014} the corresponding opacity lies between $10^{-2}$ and $2\\times 10^{-1}$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$. These values have to be compared with an estimation made using Eq.~\\ref{kappaR}. Using this latter formula, we obtained an opacity of the order of $\\sim 1.4 \\times 10^{-4}$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for an effective temperature of the proto-Sun around $4400$ K. It demonstrates that the opacity of the gas alone is order of magnitudes lower than what we find if a residual amount of dust is left. As a conclusion, if large particles (for instance with a radius $a \\sim 1$ cm) are pushed away by some transport mechanism, then the small ones remaining on the optical path have an effect on the opacity strong enough to annihilate any force produced by photophoresis and/or radiation pressure. Hence, two alternatives would be possible: (1) all the grains are displaced at the same velocity, which is that of the smallest aggregates, or (2) the biggest particles are transported over a fraction of AU, the residual population of smaller grains coagulate and restablish a distribution of sizes containing a fraction of large dusts but with a global mass of solids disminished. The process could then repeat and extend itself, tending to a dust-free gas in the disk mid-plane.\\\\    Concerning the first scenario, the comets formation zone could be provided in crystal only if the smallest aggregates reach a far enough distance during the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk. In our approach, this could occur in the case of a non-irradiated disk (see Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}.a) which is not the most realistic model. Unfortunately, when the irradiation is taken into account, particles with radius as small as $10^{-5}$ m seem to  stay at few AU from the Sun. In this situation, the second scenario could be invoked. In that case, the coagulation process has to be fast enough; such a scenario looks plausible since \\cite{ormel_etal_2007} found that aggregates can grow to radii up to $\\sim 10$ cm in a few thousand years. The depletion in solids created locally by the short-range migration of the biggest grains yields to a more transparent medium by decreasing the opacity (see dash-dotted curve in Fig.~\\ref{opacity_cuzzi_etal2014}). The proposed mechanism, which differs from that described in studies like \\cite{krauss_wurm_2005} --who did not take into account the feedback on opacity-- has to be studied in details in future researches. In-depth investigations of this scenario could decide if the net effect lets the grains piling up at the inner edge of the disk or if this solid material could be efficiently swept out from inner regions. The answer is not straightforward.  For instance, we have noticed that a high porosity of aggregates (which favors the photophoresis by producing low thermal conductivities) is an unfavorable factor by enhancing the opacity. In addition, to crown it all, the thermal conductivity of grains seems to depend on their size  \\citep[see][]{presley_christensen_1997}. Beside these effects, in future investigations, one has to include coagulation/fragmentation and  the detailed evolution of the aggregates population over time, together with their influence on the opacity, has to be consistently followed.}}\\\\\n\n  {{Throughout this paragraph, the physical processes were assumed to take place in the disk plane of symmetry, which is supposed to embed the majority of dust grains. Of course, the mid-plane of the disk is also the optically thickest region and the material becomes progressively  optically thinner and thinner moving outwards. For instance, we have estimated the optical depth $\\tau_{10}$ at $\\sim 10$ AU at the ``external surface'', and we have made comparison with its mid-plane counterpart. Using \\citep{cuzzi_etal_2014} opacities (that include the effect of dust) we got $\\tau_{10}$ ranging between $\\sim 35$  and more than $100$ at the mid-plane, while $\\tau_{10}$ never exceeded $\\sim 0.6$ during the same disk lifetime of $6$ Myr, when evaluated at the ``external surface''. Then, even if the disk mid-plane stays very opaque, transport induced by stellar photon flux could occur through other optically thinner regions.}}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{offplane}About a possible off mid-plane transport}\n\n   As mentioned above, we have mainly assumed that particles were transported through the disk mid-plane. In real accretion disks,\ndust particles are not confined in the mid-plane, but they rather explore the entire thickness of the disk between the \nmid-plane and the external surface (see Fig.~\\ref{sketch}). As the surface is less dense and \ncooler compared to that at the mid-plane, we can expect quite different drift velocities. In fact, a less \ndense matter is more transparent and thus favors a larger effect of the radiation pressure. Concerning the photophoretic force, the \nnet effect is more uncertain: a less opaque gas should cause an easier heating of particles (that favors the photophoretic effect, if\nthis heating is restricted to one ``side'' of each particle) \nwhile the scarcity of molecules available for photophoresis would be a limiting factor. Throughout this paragraph, one has to keep in mind\nthat the dust grains are probably much more abundant in the disk mid-plane than at the external surface, for instance in the steady-state\nregime the vertical distribution of grains follows a gaussian law \\cite[see for instance][]{birnstiel_2011}. Nonetheless, the determination\nof the actual vertical distribution in our context is, by far, beyond the primarily scope of the present paper.\\\\\n\n   Concerning the transport of particles at the external surface of the disk, one can argue that \nirradiation by the stellar wind and/or by energetic galactic cosmic rays, could damage their lattice and \nsubsequently produces an irradiation-induced amorphization\n(see for instance \\cite{fama_etal_2010} for a discussion concerning the water ice or \\cite{leguillou_etal_2013} for an experimental\nstudy of the effect of electron irradiation of kerogens). Nevertheless, the small cross-section of dust particles could prevent this\neffect. In future works, a more in depth discussion is needed about this aspect.\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\hspace{0cm}\\includegraphics[angle=-90, width=18cm]{compa_vdr_midpl_surf_3.ps}\n\\caption[]{\\label{Vdrift}The drift velocity computed: (a) in the disk mid-plane, (b) at the external surface, for the initial\n           disk model (\\textit{i.e.} at $t= 0.00$ Myr) represented by a solid line and at $t= 1.3 \\times 10^{-2}$ Myr (corresponding to\n           a disk mass of about $\\sim 90$\\% of the initial mass) shown by a dashed line, in this case the lines are almost merged. \n           All these computation were done assuming a particle radius of $10^{-3}$ m.

The major difference\nbetween situations at external surface and mid-plane consists in the role played by $F_{\\rm rad}$ at the surface. \n   Tab.~\\ref{forcesat2AU} gives precise value of forces at $2$ AU from the proto-Sun.\nWe can remark that the\nphotophoretic force does not undergo a large change between the two locations: the effect of the higher radiative flux at the\nsurface seems to be compensated by the increasing scarcity of gas molecules contributing to the photophoresis. Finally, the\nglobal resulting force (\\textit{i.e.} given by the sum $F_{\\rm res}+F_{\\rm rad}+F_{\\rm ph}$) appears to be not so different at disk mid-plane\nand at external surface (\\textit{i.e.} it ranges between $\\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-10}$ for our test particle). \nAs a consequence, the quantitatively significant difference between mid-plane and external surface comes from factor of $10^{4}$ in\ngas--grain coupling time $\\tau$ (see Fig.\\ref{Fphetc} panels (g) and (h) for $r\\sim 2$ AU). This ratio of 4 orders of magnitude is\ndue to local thermodynamic conditions.\n\n  We recall that $\\tau \\propto C_{c}/\\eta$ (see Eqs. \\ref{tau} and Eq. \\ref{Cc}) in a low density environment.\nMoreover, in low density regions  $\\eta$ becomes very low implying large $1/\\eta$ values, while the Knudsen's number $K_{n}$ tends \nto be very large, and for $K_{n} \\gg 1$\nwe have $C_{c} \\simeq 1.701 \\, K_{n}$, so that $C_{c}$ also increases. The net result is a strong rise of $\\tau$. The\nphysical meaning of these large value of $\\tau$ is a weak coupling between the aggregates and the gas.\\\\\n\n  In summary, at the external boundary of the dense region of the protoplanetary disk the photophoretic force may not be the dominant\nforce, particularly if the thermal conductivity $\\lambda_{\\rm p}$ is much higher than $10^{-3}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. The fact that\nthe aggregates particles are weakly coupled to the gas allows any small force to generate a transport process. In such circumstances,\nparticles can sediment, be pushed outward by stellar wind bursts, taken away by photoevaporation, etc. A study of such transport\nprocesses is far beyond the scope of the present paper and required a minimum modelization of the disk's ``atmosphere''.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{concl}Conclusion and perspectives}\n\n\n   The 1+1D disk model used here implements the classical $\\alpha$-viscosity prescription that allows a description of the physical\nevolution of the disk as it undergoes mass and angular momentum transport. To this standard approach, we have added time-dependent\nirradiation which is consistent with the evolution of the proto-Sun along the Pre-Main Sequence phase. Since this phase corresponds to\nthe T Tauri period of our star, which is known to be contemporary of the existence of a circumstellar dusty and gaseous accretion\ndisk, our model represents a noticeable improvement of the proto-solar Nebula modeling. This is particularly true in our context, in which\nwe examine the influence of proto-Sun radiation on the transport of dust driven by photophoresis.\\\\\n\n  {{By adopting the same prescription used in previous works for the opacity of the gas}}, we have found that the high luminosity of \nthe Sun considered in its T Tauri phase favors the migration of dust\ngrains to the outer parts of the protoplanetary disk. However, the effect is not as high as if the irradiation would not change the\ndisk properties. Indeed, the irradiation enhances the computed turbulent viscosity which in turn increases the accretion velocity.\nConsequently, the particles are slowed down whereas the disk lifetime is reduced. This latter effect reduces the need for an \\textit{ad hoc}\nphotoevaporation in order to get ages in agreement with astronomical observations.\n\n{{Unfortunately, since the dust particles have migration velocities that depend on their size, a trail of small grains should be left along the line of sight. The smallest aggregates show an important contribution to the gas--dust opacity. This leads to a strong extinction which could eliminate the photophoretic effect. This point is one of our most important results and, models involving a consistent treatment of the opacity as a function of dust content, are highly desirable. Noticeably, external optically thin disk regions could provide an environment favorable to stellar photons driven transport processes. In such a case, the net quantity of dust delivered to the comets formation zone could not ba large enough to explain the observations, because of the vertical stratification of grain distribution.}}\\\\\n\n  Besides this, using gas temperature distribution provided by our model, we confirm that amorphous grains cannot be annealed into\nregions beyond $\\sim 1-2$ AU, due to arguments based on phase transition kinetics at gas temperature. More importantly, we have identified the heat conductivity of\naggregates as a crucial parameter. Using realistic estimations and published experimental results for the thermal conductivity, we have\nshown that the photophoretic strength can be considerably reduced and could yield to situations in which photophoretic migration\nthrough the mid-plane could be marginal even if the disk is irradiated by a bright PMS star.\\\\\n\n\n   Laboratory experimentations conducted by \\cite{vanEymeren_wurm_2012} on ice aggregates, trapped in a cell under the combined effects\nof photophoresis and thermophoresis, show that rotation induced by photophoretic\nforces does not change the strength of photophoresis force, but ignores the influence of a turbulent flow.\n   \\cite{krauss_etal_2007} and \\cite{moudens_etal_2011} have discussed, respectively the possible effects of the turbulence and of the particles\nrotation. However, they considered turbulence and rotation as independent processes. \\cite{krauss_etal_2007}, who discussed turbulence as a \nfactor affecting the mean radial motion of dusts, concluded that turbulence essentially does not prevent the outward migration.\n\\cite{moudens_etal_2011} have looked to the influence of rotation of particles on themselves, induced for instance by particle to\nparticle collisions. We have to keep in mind that dusts are embedded in a gaseous environment, to which they are strongly coupled\n(at least in the mid-plane). Following a simple picture, a turbulent flow is made of a cascade of eddies, with a distribution of sizes and\nlifetimes. In such a flow, aggregates can meet eddies with rotational motion in a plane that contains the radial direction.\n In this configuration, if the thermal relaxation timescale of the particle is larger than the \noverturning timescale of the turbulent eddy, the temperature distribution at the surface of the particle could be uniformized, leading\nto the removal of any photophoretic force. The global effect on dust migration through the disk depends on the intrinsic properties\nof dust (thermal properties and aerodynamics drag) and on statistical properties of the involved turbulent flow. The net result\nwill be a convolution of the statistical distribution of grains properties (bulk material nature, porosity, size, etc) and of the \nproperties of the cascade of turbulent eddies.\\\\\n\n  In a first approach, the influence of the turbulence on dust trajectories could also be investigated using a particle-tracking technics as already \nemployed in other contexts by \\cite{supulver_lin_2000} or \\cite{ciesla_sandford_2012}. Thanks to this method, applied in a 2D or \nbetter a 3D geometry, we could follow the trajectories of particles within the disk and even those that could be launched upwards,\npushed outward by the radiation pressure and possibly fall back onto the Nebula at different locations. A similar scenario\nhas been already studied by \\cite{wurm_haack_2009} in their investigations concerning the outward transport of CAIs during \nFU-Orionis events. The vertical transport of grains, caused by convection and thermophoresis could be also included together with the existence of \na quiet ``dead zone'' in which the turbulent activity should be very low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section{\\label{append}Description of the disk model}\n\n   Our model of accretion disk is basically based on a generalized version of the procedure originally published by\n\\cite{papaloizou_terquem_1999}.

Thus, aggregates made of olivine could be expected to exhibit a higher heat conductivity than\nthose built from amorphous monomers of SiO$_2$.\\\\\n\n     All these arguments, together with the properties of \nthe turbulence do not support far migrations of dust particles, but favor transport by photophoresis limited to maximum distances between $\\sim 5$ AU and $\\sim 30$ AU \naccompanied by several segregation processes on porosity, chemical nature and size; processes which will be difficult to disentangle.\\\\\n\n   The emissivity $\\epsilon$ is also a thermodynamic parameter.

The tendency is that small particles move slower than bigger ones. For the computation of the trajectories, the employed prescription --also used in previous published works-- assumes the existence of the dust-free space between the inner boundary of the disk and the position of the ``test particles'' $r_p$ (see Fig.~\\ref{sketch}). This simplifying hypothesis allows the use of the opacity law given by Eq.~\\ref{kappaR} that accounts only for the gas Rayleigh's scattering, which is valid in the absence of dust grains. In observed accretion disk, as in the ISM, the populations of grains are not monodisperse but rather follow a size distribution \\citep[see for instance][and references therein]{apai_lauretta_2010}. As it has been noticed, the transport of the largest grains is faster than that of small particles, then some amount of small aggregates should remain along the line of sight between the Sun and the largest dust grains. Unfortunately, the small grains are the most numerous as the distribution of the grains size is believed to follow a powerlaw $a^{-n}$ with $n \\sim 3$, and consequently they produce a dominant contribution to the opacity. Indeed, in Fig.~\\ref{opacity_cuzzi_etal2014} one can compare the opacity laws \\citep{cuzzi_etal_2014} resulting from an aggregates sizes distribution spanning from $1$ to $10$ $\\mu$m and another with radii between $1$ $\\mu$m--$1$ cm. Clearly,  the population dominated by the smallest particles produces the highest opacity.\\\\   For our purpose, the relevant distribution in size is the one with radii between $1$ $\\mu$m--$1$ cm. As we can see in Fig.~\\ref{opacity_cuzzi_etal2014} the corresponding opacity lies between $10^{-2}$ and $2\\times 10^{-1}$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$. These values have to be compared with an estimation made using Eq.~\\ref{kappaR}. Using this latter formula, we obtained an opacity of the order of $\\sim 1.4 \\times 10^{-4}$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for an effective temperature of the proto-Sun around $4400$ K. It demonstrates that the opacity of the gas alone is order of magnitudes lower than what we find if a residual amount of dust is left. As a conclusion, if large particles (for instance with a radius $a \\sim 1$ cm) are pushed away by some transport mechanism, then the small ones remaining on the optical path have an effect on the opacity strong enough to annihilate any force produced by photophoresis and/or radiation pressure. Hence, two alternatives would be possible: (1) all the grains are displaced at the same velocity, which is that of the smallest aggregates, or (2) the biggest particles are transported over a fraction of AU, the residual population of smaller grains coagulate and restablish a distribution of sizes containing a fraction of large dusts but with a global mass of solids disminished. The process could then repeat and extend itself, tending to a dust-free gas in the disk mid-plane.\\\\    Concerning the first scenario, the comets formation zone could be provided in crystal only if the smallest aggregates reach a far enough distance during the lifetime of the protoplanetary disk. In our approach, this could occur in the case of a non-irradiated disk (see Fig.~\\ref{firstresults}.a) which is not the most realistic model. Unfortunately, when the irradiation is taken into account, particles with radius as small as $10^{-5}$ m seem to  stay at few AU from the Sun. In this situation, the second scenario could be invoked. In that case, the coagulation process has to be fast enough; such a scenario looks plausible since \\cite{ormel_etal_2007} found that aggregates can grow to radii up to $\\sim 10$ cm in a few thousand years. The depletion in solids created locally by the short-range migration of the biggest grains yields to a more transparent medium by decreasing the opacity (see dash-dotted curve in Fig.~\\ref{opacity_cuzzi_etal2014}). The proposed mechanism, which differs from that described in studies like \\cite{krauss_wurm_2005} --who did not take into account the feedback on opacity-- has to be studied in details in future researches. In-depth investigations of this scenario could decide if the net effect lets the grains piling up at the inner edge of the disk or if this solid material could be efficiently swept out from inner regions. The answer is not straightforward.  For instance, we have noticed that a high porosity of aggregates (which favors the photophoresis by producing low thermal conductivities) is an unfavorable factor by enhancing the opacity. In addition, to crown it all, the thermal conductivity of grains seems to depend on their size  \\citep[see][]{presley_christensen_1997}. Beside these effects, in future investigations, one has to include coagulation/fragmentation and  the detailed evolution of the aggregates population over time, together with their influence on the opacity, has to be consistently followed.}}\\\\\n\n  {{Throughout this paragraph, the physical processes were assumed to take place in the disk plane of symmetry, which is supposed to embed the majority of dust grains. Of course, the mid-plane of the disk is also the optically thickest region and the material becomes progressively  optically thinner and thinner moving outwards. For instance, we have estimated the optical depth $\\tau_{10}$ at $\\sim 10$ AU at the ``external surface'', and we have made comparison with its mid-plane counterpart. Using \\citep{cuzzi_etal_2014} opacities (that include the effect of dust) we got $\\tau_{10}$ ranging between $\\sim 35$  and more than $100$ at the mid-plane, while $\\tau_{10}$ never exceeded $\\sim 0.6$ during the same disk lifetime of $6$ Myr, when evaluated at the ``external surface''. Then, even if the disk mid-plane stays very opaque, transport induced by stellar photon flux could occur through other optically thinner regions.}}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{offplane}About a possible off mid-plane transport}\n\n   As mentioned above, we have mainly assumed that particles were transported through the disk mid-plane. In real accretion disks,\ndust particles are not confined in the mid-plane, but they rather explore the entire thickness of the disk between the \nmid-plane and the external surface (see Fig.~\\ref{sketch}). As the surface is less dense and \ncooler compared to that at the mid-plane, we can expect quite different drift velocities. In fact, a less \ndense matter is more transparent and thus favors a larger effect of the radiation pressure. Concerning the photophoretic force, the \nnet effect is more uncertain: a less opaque gas should cause an easier heating of particles (that favors the photophoretic effect, if\nthis heating is restricted to one ``side'' of each particle) \nwhile the scarcity of molecules available for photophoresis would be a limiting factor. Throughout this paragraph, one has to keep in mind\nthat the dust grains are probably much more abundant in the disk mid-plane than at the external surface, for instance in the steady-state\nregime the vertical distribution of grains follows a gaussian law \\cite[see for instance][]{birnstiel_2011}. Nonetheless, the determination\nof the actual vertical distribution in our context is, by far, beyond the primarily scope of the present paper.\\\\\n\n   Concerning the transport of particles at the external surface of the disk, one can argue that \nirradiation by the stellar wind and/or by energetic galactic cosmic rays, could damage their lattice and \nsubsequently produces an irradiation-induced amorphization\n(see for instance \\cite{fama_etal_2010} for a discussion concerning the water ice or \\cite{leguillou_etal_2013} for an experimental\nstudy of the effect of electron irradiation of kerogens). Nevertheless, the small cross-section of dust particles could prevent this\neffect. In future works, a more in depth discussion is needed about this aspect.\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\hspace{0cm}\\includegraphics[angle=-90, width=18cm]{compa_vdr_midpl_surf_3.ps}\n\\caption[]{\\label{Vdrift}The drift velocity computed: (a) in the disk mid-plane, (b) at the external surface, for the initial\n           disk model (\\textit{i.e.} at $t= 0.00$ Myr) represented by a solid line and at $t= 1.3 \\times 10^{-2}$ Myr (corresponding to\n           a disk mass of about $\\sim 90$\\% of the initial mass) shown by a dashed line, in this case the lines are almost merged. \n           All these computation were done assuming a particle radius of $10^{-3}$ m.

The major difference\nbetween situations at external surface and mid-plane consists in the role played by $F_{\\rm rad}$ at the surface. \n   Tab.~\\ref{forcesat2AU} gives precise value of forces at $2$ AU from the proto-Sun.\nWe can remark that the\nphotophoretic force does not undergo a large change between the two locations: the effect of the higher radiative flux at the\nsurface seems to be compensated by the increasing scarcity of gas molecules contributing to the photophoresis. Finally, the\nglobal resulting force (\\textit{i.e.} given by the sum $F_{\\rm res}+F_{\\rm rad}+F_{\\rm ph}$) appears to be not so different at disk mid-plane\nand at external surface (\\textit{i.e.} it ranges between $\\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-10}$ for our test particle). \nAs a consequence, the quantitatively significant difference between mid-plane and external surface comes from factor of $10^{4}$ in\ngas--grain coupling time $\\tau$ (see Fig.\\ref{Fphetc} panels (g) and (h) for $r\\sim 2$ AU). This ratio of 4 orders of magnitude is\ndue to local thermodynamic conditions.\n\n  We recall that $\\tau \\propto C_{c}/\\eta$ (see Eqs. \\ref{tau} and Eq. \\ref{Cc}) in a low density environment.\nMoreover, in low density regions  $\\eta$ becomes very low implying large $1/\\eta$ values, while the Knudsen's number $K_{n}$ tends \nto be very large, and for $K_{n} \\gg 1$\nwe have $C_{c} \\simeq 1.701 \\, K_{n}$, so that $C_{c}$ also increases. The net result is a strong rise of $\\tau$. The\nphysical meaning of these large value of $\\tau$ is a weak coupling between the aggregates and the gas.\\\\\n\n  In summary, at the external boundary of the dense region of the protoplanetary disk the photophoretic force may not be the dominant\nforce, particularly if the thermal conductivity $\\lambda_{\\rm p}$ is much higher than $10^{-3}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. The fact that\nthe aggregates particles are weakly coupled to the gas allows any small force to generate a transport process. In such circumstances,\nparticles can sediment, be pushed outward by stellar wind bursts, taken away by photoevaporation, etc. A study of such transport\nprocesses is far beyond the scope of the present paper and required a minimum modelization of the disk's ``atmosphere''.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{concl}Conclusion and perspectives}\n\n\n   The 1+1D disk model used here implements the classical $\\alpha$-viscosity prescription that allows a description of the physical\nevolution of the disk as it undergoes mass and angular momentum transport. To this standard approach, we have added time-dependent\nirradiation which is consistent with the evolution of the proto-Sun along the Pre-Main Sequence phase. Since this phase corresponds to\nthe T Tauri period of our star, which is known to be contemporary of the existence of a circumstellar dusty and gaseous accretion\ndisk, our model represents a noticeable improvement of the proto-solar Nebula modeling. This is particularly true in our context, in which\nwe examine the influence of proto-Sun radiation on the transport of dust driven by photophoresis.\\\\\n\n  {{By adopting the same prescription used in previous works for the opacity of the gas}}, we have found that the high luminosity of \nthe Sun considered in its T Tauri phase favors the migration of dust\ngrains to the outer parts of the protoplanetary disk. However, the effect is not as high as if the irradiation would not change the\ndisk properties. Indeed, the irradiation enhances the computed turbulent viscosity which in turn increases the accretion velocity.\nConsequently, the particles are slowed down whereas the disk lifetime is reduced. This latter effect reduces the need for an \\textit{ad hoc}\nphotoevaporation in order to get ages in agreement with astronomical observations.\n\n{{Unfortunately, since the dust particles have migration velocities that depend on their size, a trail of small grains should be left along the line of sight. The smallest aggregates show an important contribution to the gas--dust opacity. This leads to a strong extinction which could eliminate the photophoretic effect. This point is one of our most important results and, models involving a consistent treatment of the opacity as a function of dust content, are highly desirable. Noticeably, external optically thin disk regions could provide an environment favorable to stellar photons driven transport processes. In such a case, the net quantity of dust delivered to the comets formation zone could not ba large enough to explain the observations, because of the vertical stratification of grain distribution.}}\\\\\n\n  Besides this, using gas temperature distribution provided by our model, we confirm that amorphous grains cannot be annealed into\nregions beyond $\\sim 1-2$ AU, due to arguments based on phase transition kinetics at gas temperature. More importantly, we have identified the heat conductivity of\naggregates as a crucial parameter. Using realistic estimations and published experimental results for the thermal conductivity, we have\nshown that the photophoretic strength can be considerably reduced and could yield to situations in which photophoretic migration\nthrough the mid-plane could be marginal even if the disk is irradiated by a bright PMS star.\\\\\n\n\n   Laboratory experimentations conducted by \\cite{vanEymeren_wurm_2012} on ice aggregates, trapped in a cell under the combined effects\nof photophoresis and thermophoresis, show that rotation induced by photophoretic\nforces does not change the strength of photophoresis force, but ignores the influence of a turbulent flow.\n   \\cite{krauss_etal_2007} and \\cite{moudens_etal_2011} have discussed, respectively the possible effects of the turbulence and of the particles\nrotation. However, they considered turbulence and rotation as independent processes. \\cite{krauss_etal_2007}, who discussed turbulence as a \nfactor affecting the mean radial motion of dusts, concluded that turbulence essentially does not prevent the outward migration.\n\\cite{moudens_etal_2011} have looked to the influence of rotation of particles on themselves, induced for instance by particle to\nparticle collisions. We have to keep in mind that dusts are embedded in a gaseous environment, to which they are strongly coupled\n(at least in the mid-plane). Following a simple picture, a turbulent flow is made of a cascade of eddies, with a distribution of sizes and\nlifetimes. In such a flow, aggregates can meet eddies with rotational motion in a plane that contains the radial direction.\n In this configuration, if the thermal relaxation timescale of the particle is larger than the \noverturning timescale of the turbulent eddy, the temperature distribution at the surface of the particle could be uniformized, leading\nto the removal of any photophoretic force. The global effect on dust migration through the disk depends on the intrinsic properties\nof dust (thermal properties and aerodynamics drag) and on statistical properties of the involved turbulent flow. The net result\nwill be a convolution of the statistical distribution of grains properties (bulk material nature, porosity, size, etc) and of the \nproperties of the cascade of turbulent eddies.\\\\\n\n  In a first approach, the influence of the turbulence on dust trajectories could also be investigated using a particle-tracking technics as already \nemployed in other contexts by \\cite{supulver_lin_2000} or \\cite{ciesla_sandford_2012}. Thanks to this method, applied in a 2D or \nbetter a 3D geometry, we could follow the trajectories of particles within the disk and even those that could be launched upwards,\npushed outward by the radiation pressure and possibly fall back onto the Nebula at different locations. A similar scenario\nhas been already studied by \\cite{wurm_haack_2009} in their investigations concerning the outward transport of CAIs during \nFU-Orionis events. The vertical transport of grains, caused by convection and thermophoresis could be also included together with the existence of \na quiet ``dead zone'' in which the turbulent activity should be very low.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section{\\label{append}Description of the disk model}\n\n   Our model of accretion disk is basically based on a generalized version of the procedure originally published by\n\\cite{papaloizou_terquem_1999}.

(\\ref{Tirr}), $T_{b}$ is the background temperature, \\textit{i.e.} the temperature of the\nmedium in which the disk is immersed. We have chosen $T_{b}= 10$ K.\n\n  The mid-height of the disk being not known a priori, we have to solve a Two Boundary Value Problems (TBVP). While some authors\nwork with relaxation algorithms \\citep[][]{cannizzo_1992,milsom_etal_1994,dalessio_etal_1998,hameury_etal_1998}; we have\nprefered an algorithm based on shooting methods \n\\citep[][]{lin_papaloizou_1980,meyer_meyerHofmeister_1982,mineshige_osaki_1983,smak_1984,mineshige_etal_1990,rozanska_etal_1999,papaloizou_terquem_1999}\n\nturning our TBVP into\nan Initial Values Problems (IVP): the equations of the vertical structure are integrated from the surface of the disk to the mid-plan.\nThe 5th-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step length described in \\cite{Num_Recipes}, already used in previous other works\n\\citep[see][]{papaloizou_terquem_1999,alibert_etal_2005,dodson-robinson_etal_2009}, has been employed to perform the vertical\nintegration. To reduce the effects of the stiffness of the set of equations, we have opted for --after several tests-- the set of\nvariables $u=\\mathrm{ln}(\\rho)$, $v= F/\\sigma/T_{s}^{4}$ and $w= \\mathrm{ln}(T)$ \\citep[also adopted by][]{hure_2000}. \nThe equation $F(z=0)= 0$ is then solved by a root finding method. Finally, the vertically averaged turbulent viscosity\n$<\\nu>=\\int_{-H}^{+H}\\rho \\nu \\mathrm{d}z/\\Sigma$ is tabulated as a function of disk surface density \n$\\Sigma= \\int_{-H}^{+H}\\rho \\mathrm{d}z$, the steady state accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{\\rm st}= 3\\pi <\\nu> \\Sigma$, the turbulent\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$ and the age of the system $t$ (\\textit{i.e.} providing $T_{eff}(t)$ and $R_{\\star}(t)$ which are directly \ninvolved in the calculation. During the integration of the Eq.

(\\ref{Eq_evol}), combined with boundary conditions similar\nto those used by \\cite{alibert_etal_2005}, which is a non-linear equation ($<\\nu>$ depends on the\nsolution $\\Sigma$). Unfortunately, there is no standard numerical method for such equation. Although explicit finite difference method is often used\n\\citep[\\textit{e.g.}][]{papaloizo_etal_1983,ruden_lin_1986,nakamoto_nakagawa_1994,jin_sui_2010} the time-step must meet the\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition \\citep[see][]{courant_etal_1928} that limits the value of the time-step to small values.\nInstead of an explicit finite difference scheme, we have chosen a fully implicit scheme which has the great advantage of being\nunconditionally stable at least in the case of linear equations.\nThe obtained set of non-linear finite difference equations is solved using a multidimensional Newton--Raphson \nalgorithm \\footnote{\\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\\%27s_method}.}.

(\\ref{Tirr}), $T_{b}$ is the background temperature, \\textit{i.e.} the temperature of the\nmedium in which the disk is immersed. We have chosen $T_{b}= 10$ K.\n\n  The mid-height of the disk being not known a priori, we have to solve a Two Boundary Value Problems (TBVP). While some authors\nwork with relaxation algorithms \\citep[][]{cannizzo_1992,milsom_etal_1994,dalessio_etal_1998,hameury_etal_1998}; we have\nprefered an algorithm based on shooting methods \n\\citep[][]{lin_papaloizou_1980,meyer_meyerHofmeister_1982,mineshige_osaki_1983,smak_1984,mineshige_etal_1990,rozanska_etal_1999,papaloizou_terquem_1999}\n\nturning our TBVP into\nan Initial Values Problems (IVP): the equations of the vertical structure are integrated from the surface of the disk to the mid-plan.\nThe 5th-order Runge-Kutta method with adaptive step length described in \\cite{Num_Recipes}, already used in previous other works\n\\citep[see][]{papaloizou_terquem_1999,alibert_etal_2005,dodson-robinson_etal_2009}, has been employed to perform the vertical\nintegration. To reduce the effects of the stiffness of the set of equations, we have opted for --after several tests-- the set of\nvariables $u=\\mathrm{ln}(\\rho)$, $v= F/\\sigma/T_{s}^{4}$ and $w= \\mathrm{ln}(T)$ \\citep[also adopted by][]{hure_2000}. \nThe equation $F(z=0)= 0$ is then solved by a root finding method. Finally, the vertically averaged turbulent viscosity\n$<\\nu>=\\int_{-H}^{+H}\\rho \\nu \\mathrm{d}z/\\Sigma$ is tabulated as a function of disk surface density \n$\\Sigma= \\int_{-H}^{+H}\\rho \\mathrm{d}z$, the steady state accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{\\rm st}= 3\\pi <\\nu> \\Sigma$, the turbulent\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$ and the age of the system $t$ (\\textit{i.e.} providing $T_{eff}(t)$ and $R_{\\star}(t)$ which are directly \ninvolved in the calculation. During the integration of the Eq. (\\ref{Eq_evol}), these pre-built tables are interpolated ``on-the-fly'' by a\ndedicated routine involving advanced B-splines technics \\citep[][]{deboor_1985}.\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{secevol}Secular evolution}\n\n  The temporal evolution of the disk is governed by Eq. (\\ref{Eq_evol}), combined with boundary conditions similar\nto those used by \\cite{alibert_etal_2005}, which is a non-linear equation ($<\\nu>$ depends on the\nsolution $\\Sigma$). Unfortunately, there is no standard numerical method for such equation. Although explicit finite difference method is often used\n\\citep[\\textit{e.g.}][]{papaloizo_etal_1983,ruden_lin_1986,nakamoto_nakagawa_1994,jin_sui_2010} the time-step must meet the\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition \\citep[see][]{courant_etal_1928} that limits the value of the time-step to small values.\nInstead of an explicit finite difference scheme, we have chosen a fully implicit scheme which has the great advantage of being\nunconditionally stable at least in the case of linear equations.\nThe obtained set of non-linear finite difference equations is solved using a multidimensional Newton--Raphson \nalgorithm \\footnote{\\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\\%27s_method}.}. Our approach\nis similar to the methods used by \\cite{eggleton_1971} and \\cite{hameury_etal_1998}, respectively in the contexts of stellar structure or\naccretion disc outburst.\n\n  We used a decentralized finite difference formula\n\n\n", "index": 47, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\left.\\frac{{\\displaystyle}\\partial f}{{\\displaystyle}\\partial r}\\right|_{i} \\simeq \\left.\\frac{{\\displaystyle}\\partial\\xi}{{\\displaystyle}\\partial r}\\right|_{i} \\,\n    \\frac{{\\displaystyle} f_{i+1} - f_{i-1}}{{\\displaystyle} 2\\Delta\\xi}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E24.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\left.\\frac{{\\displaystyle}\\partial f}{{\\displaystyle}\\partial r}\\right|_{i}%&#10;\\simeq\\left.\\frac{{\\displaystyle}\\partial\\xi}{{\\displaystyle}\\partial r}\\right%&#10;|_{i}\\,\\frac{{\\displaystyle}f_{i+1}-f_{i-1}}{{\\displaystyle}2\\Delta\\xi}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo fence=\"true\">|</mo></mrow><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2243</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msub><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03be</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo fence=\"true\">|</mo></mrow><mi>i</mi></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03be</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
