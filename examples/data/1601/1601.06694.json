This yields a saturation fluence of 0.84$\\mu$J/cm$^2$.  Normally, the saturation fluence in a superconductor represents the fluence where the condensate is destroyed, but this value is at least an order of magnitude smaller than what is reported in other superconductors with similar T$_c$.  In the case of x$=$0.08 LCCO, the saturation fluence likely corresponds to the fluence where contribution from the antiferromagnetic component becomes more pronounced.  This is supported by data on x$=$0.11 LCCO (manuscript) where the superconducting and antiferromagnetic components have opposite sign, and the magnitude of the latter starts to exceed the former at $\\approx$1$\\mu$J/cm$^2$. Additionally, when $\\gamma$ is plotted as a function of $\\Delta R/R|_{max}$ for the entire fluence range considered, there is a deviation from linearity at a fluence comparable to the saturation fluence in Fig. \\ref{Fig 1}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\includegraphics [type=eps,ext=.eps,read=.eps,clip, width=3 in]{x08_DRR_max_vs_flu}\n\\centering\n\\caption[Fig 1] {\\label{Fig 1} Maximum of $|\\Delta R/R|$ vs pump fluence, from data in Fig. 1 of manuscript.  Red curve shows fitting to saturation model described in text of these supplementary materials and dashed line shows linear behavior in low-fluence regime. }\n\\end{figure}\n\nFurther evidence that a negative AF component coexists with a negative SC component, with the former dominating at higher fluence is shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig 2}.  If only one component were present, $\\Delta R/R|_{max} \\propto n_{ph}$, where n is the number of photoexcited quasiparticles.  As discussed in Ref. \\cite{Torchinsky:PnictideUltrafast} $\\gamma = B n_{ph} + 2 B n_{th}$, where $n_{th}$ is the number of thermally excited quasiparticles.  In Fig. \\ref{Fig 2}(a), the lowest temperatures yield negative y-intercepts which would imply a negative $n_{th}$, which is unphysical.  Thus, the x-axis of Fig. \\ref{Fig 2}(a) is an overestimate of $n_{ph}$, with the difference likely corresponding to a small AF component, which is resolved clearly in x$=$0.11 because it is a different sign from the superconducting component.  This negative intercept is seen clearly in Fig. \\ref{Fig 2}(c), and when this offset is included, this analysis yields a temperature dependence of $\\gamma_{th}$ consistent with the power law and the gap magnitude extracted in the manuscript.  Notably, these data, at sufficiently low fluence, are consistent with bimolecular recombination in a superconductor because the slope, B, is temperature independent until close to T$_c$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\includegraphics [type=eps,ext=.eps,read=.eps,clip, width=4.5 in]{x_08_gamma_vs_DRR_all}\n\\centering\n\\caption[Fig 2] {\\label{Fig 2} Analysis of thermal recombination rates as a function of $\\Delta R/R|_{max}$ instead of fluence.

Fig. \\ref{Fig 3} shows relaxation times, $\\tau$, across T$_c$ for x=0.08, and plotting data this way better captures sensitivity to T$_c$.  Below T$_c$, $\\tau$ begins to rise more rapidly and by the lowest temperature, $\\tau$ has increased by an order of magnitude relative to the value right above T$_c$.\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\includegraphics [type=eps,ext=.eps,read=.eps,clip, width=3 in]{x08_tau_vs_temperature}\n\\centering\n\\caption[Fig 3] {\\label{Fig 3} Temperature dependence of $\\tau = 1/\\gamma$ for x=0.08.

This behavior is distinct from hole-doped cuprates.\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\includegraphics [type=eps,ext=.eps,read=.eps,clip, width=4.5 in]{PCCO_x14_gamma_above_Tc}\n\\centering\n\\caption[Fig 4] {\\label{Fig 4} $\\gamma (T)$ for PCCO, x=0.14.

However, the x$=$0.08 sample appeared to show just one component, which is unexpected because antiferromagnetism is stronger.  In fact, a closer look at the amplitude of $\\Delta R/R$ at low temperature reveals that antiferromagnetism is likely present, but less obvious because it happens to have the same sign as the superconducting component in this doping.  This quantity is plotted in Fig. \\ref{Fig 1}, and varies linearly with pump fluence in the low fluence regime, consistent with other cuprates\\cite{Segre:YBCOUltrafast}.  These data are fit to a saturation model\\cite{Gedik:YBCOPRB}\\cite{Torchinsky:PnictideUltrafast}:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\frac{\\Delta R}{R}(\\Phi) \\propto \\int^\\infty_0 \\mathrm{e}^{-z/\\lambda}(1-\\mathrm{e}^{\\Phi(z)/Phi_{sat}})\\mathrm{d} z\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\Delta R}{R}(\\Phi)\\propto\\int^{\\infty}_{0}\\mathrm{e}^{-z/\\lambda}(1-%&#10;\\mathrm{e}^{\\Phi(z)/Phi_{sat}})\\mathrm{d}z\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><mi>R</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u221d</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></msubsup><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>z</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>i</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>d</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
