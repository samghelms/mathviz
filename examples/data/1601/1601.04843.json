The simplest \nversion of an rf SQUID involves a superconducting ring interrupted by a Josephson junction \n\\cite{Josephson1962} (Fig. \\ref{fig1}a); this device is a highly nonlinear resonator with \na strong response to applied magnetic fields. SQUID metamaterials exhibit peculiar magnetic\nproperties such as negative diamagnetic permeability, predicted both for the quantum \n\\cite{Du2006} and the classical \\cite{Lazarides2007} regime. The applied alternating\nfields induce (super)currents in the SQUID rings, which are therefore coupled through\ndipole-dipole magnetic forces. This interaction is weak due to its magnetic nature.\nHowever, it couples the SQUIDs non-locally since it falls-off as the inverse cube of their\ncenter-to-center distance.\n\n\n  \nNonlocal coupling in systems of interacting oscillators is capable of producing \ncounter-intuitive space-time patterns, called chimera states\\cite{KUR02a,ABR04}. Chimera\nstates are characterized by the coexistence of synchronous and asynchronous clusters of \noscillators. They were first observed over a decade ago, in systems of identical phase\noscillators with  symmetric  coupling \\cite{KUR02a,ABR04}, and have been intensively\nstudied both theoretically\n\\cite{Omelchenko2008,Abrams2008,Pikovsky2008b,Ott2009,Martens2010,Omelchenko2011,Yao2013,Omelchenko2013,vuellings:2014,Hizanidis2014,Zakharova2014,Bountis2014,Yeldesbay2014,hizanidis:2015}\nand experimentally, in chemical \\cite{tinsley:2012}, optical \\cite{hagerstrom:2012},\nmechanical \\cite{martens:2013}, electronic \\cite{larger:2013}, and electrochemical\n\\cite{schmidt:2014,wickramasinghe:2013} oscillator systems (for further reading refer \nto \\cite{panaggio:2015}). Recent works also report on the issue of robustness of chimera\nstates \\cite{omelchenko:2015} as well as on the emergence of chimera states in systems\nwith global \\cite{BOE15} and local coupling schemes \\cite{LAI15}. Chimera-like states\nin modular networks \\cite{SHA10,HIZ15} have also been investigated, expanding our\nunderstanding on the role of topology and dynamics for their occurrence. Recent research\nefforts aim to stabilize chimera states by feedback schemes \\cite{SIE14} and to control \nthe localization of the different regimes \\cite{BIC15,ISE15}. In \\cite{LAZ15}, chimera \nstates with very long life-times were numerically demonstrated in SQUID metamaterials\nwith weak dissipation and non-local magnetic interactions due to an alternating external \nmagnetic field. The SQUID metamaterial model had been previously used in the weak and\nnearest neighbor coupling regime, for the  investigation of intrinsic localization and\ntuneability effects \\cite{Lazarides2008a,Lazarides2012,Lazarides2013b}. Moreover, the \nsynchronization and metastability levels of the chimera states were discussed in terms \nof appropriate measures \\cite{LAZ15}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\includegraphics[angle=0, width=0.85 \\linewidth]{Chimera-SQUID-Fig01ab.png} \n\\includegraphics[angle=0, width=0.88 \\linewidth]{Chimera-SQUID-Fig01c.png} \n\\caption{(Color online)\nSchematic of an rf SQUID in an alternating magnetic field ${\\bf H}(t)$ (a), and equivalent \nelectrical circuit (b).

In addition, \nby quantifying the spatial synchronization in the SQUID array we reveal the detailed \nstructure of coherence and incoherence in the device. Finally, the parameter space for \nglobal synchronization transitions will be analyzed, providing insight into the role of \nthe external driving field. Our results will help to provide further understanding to the \nimplications of the second derivative term (inertia) in the occurrence of chimera states\n\\cite{Bountis2014,LAZ15,Jaros2015,Olmi2015}, which has not been sufficiently studied. \n\nIn the next Section, we present the non-locally coupled SQUID metamaterial model and the \nmeasures for quantifying spatial and global synchronization. Current amplitude-driving \nfrequency diagrams for a single SQUID which reveal its multistability property in the \nstrongly nonlinear regime is also presented. In Section~\\ref{sec:sec3}, \nthe numerically obtained space-time evolution of several coexisting patterns are shown for \ndifferent initial conditions. The magnitude of the \nspatial synchronization parameter is monitored in time for the non-locally coupled SQUID \nmetamaterials and the temporal complexity is discussed in terms of phase portraits of the \nindividual SQUID oscillators. In Section~\\ref{sec:sec4}, the possibility that the SQUID \nmetamaterial may undergo a synchronization-desynchronization transition is explored. \nAppropriate density plots mapping the order parameter on the dc flux bias - driving \nperiod plane unveil the relevant parameter regions in which such a transition may occur.\nIn the concluding section (Section~\\ref{sec:sec5}) we summarize our results.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{SQUID Metamaterial Modelling and Measure of Synchronization}\n\\label{sec:sec2}\nThe model under consideration involves a one-dimensional linear array of $N$ identical \nrf SQUIDs coupled together magnetically through dipole-dipole forces.

This is very crucial for the occurrence of the chimera states\nwhen considering the coupled system under investigation. The number of possible states in \na SQUID metamaterial is not merely the sum of the combinations of individual SQUID states, \nsince their collective behavior may provide many more possibilities.\nDepending on the choice of initial conditions, various space-time flux patterns may be \nobtained, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}, where the evolution of the $\\phi_n$s is monitored \nat times equal to multiples of one driving period $T=2\\pi/\\Omega$. In particular, \nFig.~\\ref{fig2}(a) corresponds to a typical pattern with two distinct domains: \na cluster of SQUIDS located around $n=150$ in which the fluxes oscillating with high \namplitude coexists with the rest of the array which oscillates with low-flux amplitude. \nThe latter part of the array is not completely homogeneous since small clusters and \nindividual SQUIDs perform slightly higher amplitude oscillations, which manifest themselves \nthrough the thin green lines. In Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(b) a similar pattern with two clusters \nof high amplitude oscillations is depicted. Single and double-headed chimera states with \nlarger sizes of incoherent clusters may also be achieved, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(c)\nand (d), respectively. A coexisting traveling pattern can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(e), \nwhere the largest part of the metamaterial is occupied by an incoherent cluster with \nvarying size and position in time. Finally Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(f) demonstrates a pattern \nof low-amplitude oscillations with multiple so-called solitary states \\cite{Maistrenko2014}, \nwhere many SQUIDs \nhave escaped from the main synchronized cluster and perform oscillations of slightly \nhigher amplitudes (depicted by the light green stripes in the otherwise orange background).\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig4a.png}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig4b.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig4c.png}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig4d.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig4e.png}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig4f.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) \nSpace-time plots for magnitude of the local order parameter $|Z_n|$ of the corresponding \nstates of Figure~\\ref{fig2}.

Note that $v_n (\\tau)$ is \nthe instantaneous voltage across the Josephson junction of the $n-$th rf SQUID. From the \nprofiles of $\\langle v_n (\\tau)\\rangle_T$ it can be seen that the coherent nodes have \nvalues very close to zero, which means that the SQUIDS in the coherent part are dominated \nby the driving force, while the incoherent nodes exhibit small deviations around the \nexternal driving frequency.\nThe synchronization within the aforementioned states can be visualized through the \nspace-time plots of the local order parameter (Eq.~\\ref{eq:locord}), shown in \nFig.~\\ref{fig4}. Red-orange colors denote the coherent regions and blue-green colors \nthe incoherent ones. These plots reveal the complexity of the synchronization levels in \nthe SQUID metamaterial: For example in Fig.~\\ref{fig4}(a) it can be seen that the \nincoherent region located in the center of the system {\\em periodically} achieves high \nvalues of \nsynchronization demonstrated by the orange ``islands'' within the cluster. This is related \nto metastability, which was extensively studied in \\cite{LAZ15}. In the coherent cluster, \non the other hand, we observe blue stripes of low synchronization which are evident for \nsolitary states that have escaped. Note that {\\em periodic synchronization}, characterized \nby periodic variation of the order parameter, has been previously observed in phase oscillator\nmodels with external periodic driving both with and without an inertial term \n\\cite{Choi1994,Hong1999}. \n\n\n\n\nAs already pointed out, a very crucial element for the formation of chimera states in our \nsystem is the multistability of periodic solutions in the single SQUID. For a certain set \nof parameter values, the single SQUID may reach either a high or a low flux amplitude \nstate, from basins of attraction typically smaller in the first case. Nonlocal coupling of \nSQUIDS can lead to stabilization of high flux amplitude states coexisting with low flux \namplitude ones. Typical phase portraits and the corresponding time series for such periodic \nsolutions are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig5} for three SQUID oscillators of Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(a).\nFigure~\\ref{fig5}(a) corresponds to the SQUID at node $10$ which belongs to the \ncoherent cluster of the chimera states of Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(a), while Figs.~\\ref{fig2}(b) \nand (c) refer to nodes on the incoherent cluster, showing high amplitude oscillations. \nThe corresponding time series in Fig.~\\ref{fig5}(a')-(c') show highly modulated \nquasiperiodic behavior. Additional investigations have shown evidence of chaotic dynamics \nwhich requires further study beyond the scope of this paper.\n \n\n\n\n\\section{Synchronization-desynchronization transition}\n\\label{sec:sec4}\nIn the previous sections we have seen how chimera states occur as a result of the high\nmultistability in the SQUID metamaterial. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the external \ndriving field dominates the frequency of the oscillations and therefore the level of \nsynchronization in the entire device. The external driving field has three control parameters, \nwhich would be easily accessible in an experiment: the dc ($\\phi_{dc}$) and ac ($\\phi_{ac}$)\nflux components and the driving period $T$ or equivalently the driving frequency $\\Omega$. \nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig6} the magnitude of the \nglobal order parameter (Eq.~\\ref{eq:globord}) averaged over the driving period \n$T=2\\pi/\\Omega$ is shown, in the parameter space of the $\\phi_{dc}$ and $T$, for three\ndifferent values of $\\phi_{ac}$. For very low values of ac component (Fig.~\\ref{fig6}(a)) \nthe level of synchronization is relatively high in the whole parameter space with distinct \nspots of lower coherence illustrated by their corresponding red color. Increasing $\\phi_{ac}$ \nto the value used in the previous sections (Fig.~\\ref{fig6}(b)), we observe that for \n$T<6$ the device is almost always synchronous. Above this critical value an area of \ndesynchronization is formed, including within it a smaller ``island'' of high synchronization.\nThe blue colored thin areas mark the border between synchronization and desynchronization.\nNote that the values for which chimera states were found in the previous sections ($T=5.9$ \nand $\\phi_{dc}=0$) the system finds itself in an area very close to this transition, which \nintuitively is logical. For further increase of the ac component (Fig.~\\ref{fig6}(c))\nthe synchronization areas shrink while the regions with less and lower coherence become \nlarger. This is interesting because it shows that even though the driving field is \nstronger, it doesn't necessarily force all the SQUID oscillators to synchronize.\nIn any case, the order parameter cannot be zero, except in the thermodynamic limit;\nfor a finite system such as the SQUID metamaterial considered here, the order parameter\nwill reach a lower bound in the desynchronized state that depends on the size of the \nsystem $N$. Density plots like those shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig6} may be useful for the \nconstruction of devices like parametric amplifiers that incorporate SQUID metamaterials\n\\cite{Castellanos2007,Castellanos2008} for which it is essential to avoid all types of \nnoise, chaos, etc.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.28\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig6a.png}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.28\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig6b.png}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.28\\textwidth,angle=-90]{fig6c.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) \nThe magnitude of the synchronization parameter (Eq.~\\ref{eq:globord}) in the parameter \nspace $(T,\\phi_{dc})$. where the brackets indicate averaging over the driving period \n$T=2\\pi/\\Omega$, with $\\Omega$ being the normalized driving frequency. \n(a) $\\phi_{ac}=0.003$, (b) $\\phi_{ac}=0.015$, and (c) $\\phi_ac=0.05$.\nOther parameters as in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}.\n\\label{fig6}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:sec5}\nIt has been demonstrated that single and double-headed chimera states coexist with \nsolitary states and patterns of travelling incoherence in nonlocally coupled SQUID \nmetamaterials. These coexisting patterns are a result of the high multistability of the \nindividual SQUID oscillator which tenders the dynamics even more complex when we consider\nan array of coupled elements. The spatial coherence was calculated through a local order \nparameter which reveals that the incoherent cluster periodically becomes coherent,\na sign of metastability previously studied.\n\n\nApart from the spatial complexity with coexisting high and low-flux amplitude oscillators,\nthe dynamics of the coupled system exhibit also temporal complexity. This is demonstrated \nthrough the phase portraits and time series of the individual SQUID oscillators, which\npresent a highly modulated quasiperiodic behavior. Evidence of chaos requires further \nstudies which will be included in a future publication. Finally, by scanning the control \nparameter space of the external dc driving field and the driving period for various values of \nthe ac field amplitude, we were able to locate the regions  where the transition from \ncoherence to incoherence occurs. This is relevant for locating chimera states in the \navailable parameter space which may also be useful in device applications. \n\n\nOur numerical simulations rely on a realistic model, which is capable of reproducing \nseveral experimental findings such as the tunability patterns of two-dimensional SQUID \nmetamaterials which are obtained by varying an applied dc flux and the driving frequency\n\\cite{Tsironis2014b}. Since several experiments in one- and two-dimensional SQUID \nmetamaterials have been already carried out, revealing very interesting properties peculiar\nto them, we believe that chimera states could in principle be detected with the presently\navailable set-ups. Thus, SQUID metamaterials may serve as a prototype, test-bed system\nto check and/or confirm theories and concepts of nonlinear dynamics of coupled oscillators.\n\\newline\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n{\\bf Acknowledgements}\n\nThis work was partially supported by\nthe European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7-REGPOT-2012-2013-1)\nunder grant agreement no 316165,\nthe Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation in the\nframework of the Increase Competitiveness Program of NUST ``MISiS'' (No. K2-2015-007),\nand the Thales Project MACOMSYS, cofinanced by the European Union (European\nSocial Fund ESF) and Greek national funds through the\nOperational Program ``Education and Lifelong Learning'' of\nthe National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) Research\nFunding Program: THALES Investing in Knowledge Society\nvia the European Social Fund.\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname url\\endcsname\\relax\n\\def\\url#1{\\texttt{#1}}\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname urlprefix\\endcsname\\relax\\def\\urlprefix{URL }\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname href\\endcsname\\relax\n\\def\\href#1#2{#2} \n\\def\\path#1{#1}\\fi\n\n\n \n\\bibitem{Anlage2011} \n  S.
