The experimental results are\nmodeled by two complementary approaches based either on\nsemiclassical or quantum mechanical descriptions. This allows us to\ncharacterize the hyperfine interaction of electron and hole spins\nwith the surrounding bath of nuclei on time scales covering several\norders of magnitude. Our results demonstrate (i) the intrinsic\nprecession of the electron spin fluctuations around the effective\nnuclear Overhauser field caused by the host lattice nuclear spins,\n(ii) the comparably long time scales for electron and hole spin\ndecoherence, as well as (iii) the dramatic enhancement of the spin\nlifetimes induced by a longitudinal magnetic field due to the\ndecoupling of nuclear and charge carrier spins.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, the spectroscopy of spin\nnoise~\\cite{aleksandrov81} has emerged as a competitive tool to\nstudy spin dynamics in close to thermal equilibrium conditions. The\nrapid development of this technique has started with detailed\ninvestigations of the spin fluctuations in atomic gases in 2004\n\\cite{sac2004}, and then moved to studies of spin noise in\nsemiconductor systems, such as bulk crystals\n~\\cite{oe2005,sac2009,hh2013,oest:nsn} or\nnanostructures~\\cite{gm2005,sp2014}, because this class of materials\nmay be the building blocks of future spin-based devices. For many\napplications, self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have\nbeen considered, because QDs can be grown epitaxially and\nimplemented into established semiconductor\nenvironment~\\cite{nhb1998}. The direct band gap in combination with\na giant optical dipole moment allows for spin control operations\nthat can be performed at a terahertz rate or even faster, see,\ne.g.,~\\cite{ag2006, ag2006-1,glazov:review}. To that end, it is\nmandatory for such applications to have detailed knowledge on the\ninteractions of the involved carrier spins and the resulting\ndynamics. The spin dynamics of the confined spins of single\nelectrons and holes are mostly determined by the interaction with\nthe surrounding nuclei in the dot, which are theoretically treated\nusually by the central spin model~(CSM).\n\nFirst experimental investigations on the spin noise of singly-charged\nQDs were undertaken by Crooker\n\\textit{et al.}~\\cite{sac2010}. Further studies on such QDs included, for\nexample, the observation of the hole spin decoupling from the\nsurrounding nuclei on the fluctuation level~\\cite{yl2012}. Another\nachievement was related with the investigation of hole spin noise\ncorrelations probed by two beams in a two-colour optical spin noise\ntechnique, making it possible to reveal the homogeneous lifetime of\nthe optical transition in the dot, despite the inevitable\ninhomogeneous broadening of the QD ensemble~\\cite{ly2014}. However,\nuntil now the objects of investigation of the spin noise in quantum\ndot ensembles were, to the best of our knowledge, resident hole\nspins only. If at all, electrons were additionally excited by a weak\nnon-resonant pump laser, by which the spin fluctuations of the\noptically excited electron spins became observable~\\cite{sac2010}.\n\nIn contrast to the lack of comprehensive experimental investigations\nof the electron spin noise in $n$-doped quantum dots, theoretical\ntreatments do already exist. Two complementary approaches, based on\na semiclassical treatment utilizing the Bloch equations and\naveraging over the static nuclear spin fluctuations~\\cite{mg2012},\nand a fully quantum mechanical approach that is based on the\nChebyshev polynomial technique~\\cite{jh2014-1}, lead to almost\nidentical predictions of spin noise spectra~\\cite{jh2014}.\n\nThis work aims at a detailed experimental and theoretical\ninvestigation of resident electron and hole spin fluctuations in QD\nensembles. We present experimental results on these fluctuations in\nabsence of external fields, where the electron spin precession\naround Overhauser field fluctuations is revealed. We also\ndemonstrate comparable time scales for long-term spin decoherence in\n$n$- and $p$-type QDs. This result, being unexpected within the\nsimple CSM, is explained by the inclusion of nuclear quadrupole\ninteractions~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad,jh2015}.\n\nFurther, we study the behaviour of the spin noise under application\nof transverse and longitudinal static fields. We demonstrate that,\nlike in the case of hole spins~\\cite{yl2012}, the electron spins\nalso undergo decoupling from the nuclear spins. This effect takes\nplace at somewhat stronger longitudinal fields, demonstrating a\nstronger coupling to the surrounding bath of nuclei. Additionally,\nwe are able to trace the redistribution of the spin noise power\nbetween the nuclei-induced carrier spin precession and the\nquasi-static contributions at zero magnetic field.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Sec.~\\ref{sec:theory} introduces\nthe theoretical approaches to calculate the spin noise; the\ndescription of samples and setup is presented in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:samples}. Section~\\ref{sec:discussion} presents the\nexperimental results and their discussion in relation to the\ntheoretical predictions. Conclusions are given in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:conclusion}.\n\n\\section{Theory} \\label{sec:theory}\n\nIn optical spin noise spectroscopy, spin fluctuations are monitored\nas noise in the Faraday or Kerr rotation of a continuous-wave (cw)\nlinearly polarized laser beam. The fluctuation angles $\\vartheta_F$\n(Faraday effect, transmission geometry) and $\\vartheta_K$ (Kerr\neffect, reflection geometry) are proportional to the spontaneous\nfluctuations of the charge carrier spins. The autocorrelation\nfunctions of the spin signals are proportional to the correlation\nfunctions of electron and hole spin-$z$ components, $S_{e,z}(t)$ and\n$S_{h,z}(t)$, with the $z\\parallel [001]$ axis being the direction\nof the probe beam propagation coinciding with the quantum dot growth\naxis~\\cite{mg2012}.\n\nWe consider an ensemble of electronically isolated quantum dots\n(QDs) in an external static magnetic field $\\bm B$. Each QD can be\ncharged either with an electron or a heavy hole. As a result, it is\nsufficient to calculate the spin fluctuation of a charge carrier\nwithin a dot and afterwards average over the quantum dot\ndistribution. Since the QDs are independent of each other, the\ncross-correlations between the spins in different QDs are\nnegligible. Further, no correlation between electron and hole spins\nappears, see Refs.~\\cite{noise-excitons,ly2014} for details.\n\nHence, we are interested in the frequency spectra of the electron\nand hole spin fluctuations defined as~\\cite{mg2012,noise-excitons}:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  (S_{{\\mu},z}^2)_\\omega=\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\left\\langle \\{\\hat S_{\\mu,z}(\\tau), \\hat S_{\\mu,z}(0)\\}_s\\right\\rangle {\\rm{e}}^{{\\rm i}\\omega\\tau}{\\mathrm d}\\tau.\n  \\label{spectrum0}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"(S_{{\\mu},z}^{2})_{\\omega}=\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left\\langle\\{\\hat{S}%&#10;_{\\mu,z}(\\tau),\\hat{S}_{\\mu,z}(0)\\}_{s}\\right\\rangle{\\rm{e}}^{{\\rm i}\\omega%&#10;\\tau}{\\mathrm{d}}\\tau.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></munderover><mrow><mrow><mo>\u27e8</mo><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>d</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03677.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\mathcal A$ and $\\mathcal B$ are constants which depend on\nthe details of the studied sample, the radiation propagation\ngeometry and the probe\nfrequency~\\cite{mg2012,noise-excitons,vz2013}.

The peak at positive frequencies is related\nwith the spin precession. At sufficiently small fields\n($\\Omega_B^\\mu \\ll \\delta_\\mu$) its position is determined by the\ncharacteristic frequency of spin precession in the field of nuclear\nspin fluctuations, $\\sim \\delta_\\mu$, whereas at high fields\n($\\Omega_B^\\mu \\gg \\delta_\\mu$) it is determined by the Larmor\nfrequency $\\Omega_B^\\mu$ of the spin precession about the external\nfield. The shape of the precession peak is determined by the\ndistribution function of the random nuclear fluctuations.\n\nThe peak at $\\omega=0$ in the noise spectrum is caused by the spin\ncomponents conserved during precession~\\cite{merkulov02,mg2012}. In\nthe semiclassical model outlined above this peak obeys a Lorentzian\nshape with the half width at half maximum (HWHM) being $\\tau_s^\\mu$.\nIn fact, the semiclassical treatment with frozen nuclear spins fails\nto accurately describe the low-frequency behavior of the spin noise,\nsince at low frequencies $\\omega \\ll \\delta_\\mu$ the nuclear\ndynamics becomes important. Generally, to describe the features of\nthe spin noise spectrum at low frequencies, a quantum mechanical\ntreatment as described in Sec.~\\ref{sec:quantum} is needed. Before\nexplaining this treatment in detail we briefly address some\nsituations in which the semiclassical approach can be used.\n\nBasically, the semiclassical treatment can be applied to study the\nspin noise at low frequencies $\\omega \\ll \\delta_\\mu$ if the\nelectron {(hole)} feedback on the nuclear spin dynamics can be\nneglected. Hence, the temporal evolution of electron {(hole)} and\n nuclear fluctuations are decoupled in Eq.~\\eqref{Heisenberg}.\nHowever, the dynamics of the nuclear spins can be included into\nconsideration also. In this situation, the electron spin precesses,\nin addition to the static external field, in a time-dependent\nnuclear field $\\bm \\Omega_N^\\mu(t)$. This can be realized in a\nsemiclassical treatment if the electron or the hole leaves its site\nof localization before nuclear spin precession takes place, i.e. due\nto hopping to a neighbouring empty QD or due to excitation to the\nwetting layer and consequent localization in another\ndot~\\cite{Glazov_hopping,oest:nsn}. Then the nuclear fields can be\ntreated as Gaussian random functions with correlation time $\\tau_c$,\nand analytical expressions for the spin noise spectrum can be\nderived, as shown in Ref.~\\cite{Glazov_hopping}. Another regime\nwhere the semiclassical approach can be still employed is the case\nof strong quadrupolar splittings of the nuclear spin states, $|q_k|\n\\gg |A_k^\\mu|$~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad}. In this case one can find all\ntemporal correlations of the nuclear fields, i.e. second order,\n$\\langle \\hat \\Omega_{N,\\alpha}^\\mu(\\tau)\\hat\n\\Omega_{N,\\beta}^\\mu(0)\\rangle$, and higher order correlators, from\nthe quadrupolar Hamiltonian~\\eqref{hqc} and then evaluate the\nelectron (hole) spin noise spectra semiclassically from the Bloch\nequations for the electron spin dynamics in a time-dependent\nmagnetic field. Provided that the correlation time $\\tau_c$ is\nfinite but long enough, $\\tau_c \\gg \\delta_\\mu$, the spin noise\nspectrum is described by Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} with some\n``effective'' spin relaxation $\\tau_s^\\mu$, which may be magnetic\nfield dependent. Particularly, at $B=0$ one has $\\tau_s^\\mu\\sim\n\\tau_c$~\\cite{Glazov_hopping}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum mechanical approach}\\label{sec:quantum}\n\nThe inaccurate description of the zero-frequency peak in the\nsemiclassical approach can be avoided using the quantum mechanical\ndefinition of the spin correlation functions,\nEq.~\\eqref{Heisenberg}, which we evaluate by applying the Chebyshev\npolynomial expansion technique (CET). It was originally developed as\na numerical tool to calculate the exact time evolution\n$\\exp{(-\\mathrm i \\mathcal H^\\mu \\tau)}|\\psi\\rangle$ of an\narbitrary, originally pure state $|\\psi\\rangle$ in a well defined\ntime interval $\\tau$~\\cite{TalEzer-Kosloff-84,Dobrovitski2003}. As\nrecently demonstrated~\\cite{jh2014,jh2014-1,jh2015}, it can also be\napplied to evaluate correlation functions as $(S_{\\mu,z}^2)_\\omega$\nby using the quantum typicality of random quantum\nstates~\\cite{Fehske-RMP2006}. The spin noise spectrum due to\nprecession of electrons in the Overhauser field at zero external\nmagnetic field, calculated by this quantum mechanical approach\nagrees well with the semiclassical result, Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class},\nand is only determined by the second moment $\\delta_\\mu$ of the\ndistribution function for the $A_k^\\mu$, i.\\ e.\\ Eq.\\\n\\eqref{eq:def-delta-mu}, and, if applied, by the external magnetic\nfield~\\cite{jh2014}.\n\nThe zero-frequency peak or more precisely the low-frequency spin\nnoise peak in the noise spectrum is governed by the interplay of the\nelectron or hole feedback on the nuclear spin dynamics, the\nnon-uniformity of the hyperfine\ninteraction~\\cite{merkulov02,Khaetskii} and the nuclear quadrupolar\ncouplings~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad,jh2015}. This interplay between the\nparameters $A_k^\\mu$, $\\lambda_\\mu$, $q_k$, $\\vec{n}^{(k)}$ and\n$\\eta$ of the Hamiltonian~\\eqref{Ham} has significant impact on the\nshape of the spin noise spectrum at small frequencies. A detailed\ndiscussion on the choice of the hyperfine coupling constants\n$A_k^\\mu$ used in the CET can be found in Ref.~\\cite{jh2014-1}. The\nparameters associated with the quadrupolar interaction are derived\nfrom recent microscopic studies of the electric field gradients in\n(In,Ga)As quantum dots~\\cite{bulutay} assuming an In concentration\nof $\\approx 40\\,\\%$. \nAlthough we only can include a small amount, $N\\approx 10$, of\nspin-$3/2$ nuclei in the quantum mechanical simulation, we generate\nthe coupling constants $q_k$ and the orientation vectors $\\vec{n}_k$\nfrom a distribution function reproducing the average values found in\nthe microscopic study by C.~Bulutay~\\cite{bulutay}. The average\ndeviation angle $\\theta_z$ between the orientation vectors\n$\\vec{n}_k$ is set to $\\approx 25^\\circ$. For  coupling constants\n$q_k = \\alpha x_k$, the random variable $x_k$ is drawn from a\nuniform probability distribution in the interval $x_k \\in [0.5:1]$,\nand the magnitude $\\alpha$ is determined by the ratio\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15772, "prevtext": "\nAs a result, the individual charge carrier spin noise spectrum reads~\\cite{mg2012}:\n\n", "index": 21, "text": "\\begin{multline}\n\\label{sns:class}\n(S_{{\\mu},z}^2)_\\omega=\\frac{\\tau_s^\\mu}{2}\\int{\\mathrm d}\\bm\\Omega_{{N}}^{{\\mu}} {\\cal F}_\\mu(\\bm\\Omega_{{N}}^{{\\mu}})\\left\\lbrace\\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{1+{(}\\omega{\\tau_s^\\mu}{)}^2}\\right. \\\\\n +\\left.\\frac{\\sin^2{\\theta}\\left[1+(\\omega^2+\\Omega_{{\\mu}}^2){\\tau_s^\\mu}^2\\right]}{\\left[1+(\\omega-\\Omega_{{\\mu}})^2{\\tau_s^\\mu}^2\\right]\\left[1+(\\omega+\\Omega_{{\\mu}})^2{\\tau_s^\\mu}^2\\right]}\\right\\rbrace,\n\\end{multline}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E11.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle(S_{{\\mu},z}^{2})_{\\omega}=\\frac{\\tau_{s}^{\\mu}}{2}\\int{\\mathrm{d%&#10;}}\\bm{\\Omega}_{{N}}^{{\\mu}}{\\cal F}_{\\mu}(\\bm{\\Omega}_{{N}}^{{\\mu}})\\left\\{%&#10;\\frac{\\cos^{2}\\theta}{1+{(}\\omega{\\tau_{s}^{\\mu}}{)}^{2}}\\right.\\\\&#10;\\displaystyle+\\left.\\frac{\\sin^{2}{\\theta}\\left[1+(\\omega^{2}+\\Omega_{{\\mu}}^{%&#10;2}){\\tau_{s}^{\\mu}}^{2}\\right]}{\\left[1+(\\omega-\\Omega_{{\\mu}})^{2}{\\tau_{s}^{%&#10;\\mu}}^{2}\\right]\\left[1+(\\omega+\\Omega_{{\\mu}})^{2}{\\tau_{s}^{\\mu}}^{2}\\right]%&#10;}\\right\\},\" display=\"block\"><mtable displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msubsup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msubsup><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi><msubsup><mi>\ud835\udec0</mi><mi>N</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msubsup><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2131</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>\ud835\udec0</mi><mi>N</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>{</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi>cos</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"right\"><mrow><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msup><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mmultiscripts><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><none/><mn>2</mn></mmultiscripts></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mmultiscripts><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><none/><mn>2</mn></mmultiscripts></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>+</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mmultiscripts><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><none/><mn>2</mn></mmultiscripts></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>}</mo><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03677.tex", "nexttext": "\nthat will be set to a fixed value.\nIn order to mimic larger amounts of nuclear spins, we\nhave averaged over 50 different configurations of $A_k$ and $q_k$\ndistributions with a fixed $\\delta_\\mu$ and $Q_r$.\n\nSo far, we have only discussed the modeling of a single (In,Ga)As QD\nby the CET. Since the experimental measurements are performed on an\nensemble of QDs, the averaging over the variations of the hyperfine\nfield parameters should be implemented as noted in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:semiclass}.

For details\nconcerning this averaging procedure see Ref.~\\cite{jh2014-1}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Samples and setup}\\label{sec:samples}\n\nWe study $p$- and $n$-doped ensembles of self-assembled QDs. Both\nsamples have 20-layers of MBE-grown (In,Ga)As/GaAs QDs separated by\n60 nm GaAs barriers with a QD density of 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ per\nlayer. The $p$-doped sample was annealed for 30~s at 960\n$^{\\circ}$C, and the $n$-doped at 945 $^{\\circ}$C, shifting the\nemission spectra of the samples to the sensitivity range of silicon\nphotodetectors and reducing the inhomogeneity of the QD ensemble.\nAlthough the $p$-doped QDs were not intentionally doped, the sample\nhas a background level of $p$-type doping due to residual carbon\nimpurities~\\cite{sac2010}. The $n$-type sample doping was obtained\nby incorporating $\\delta$-sheets of Si-dopants 20 nm below each QD\nlayer, with the dopant density roughly equal to the QD\ndensity~\\cite{ag2006}. The samples are mounted on the cold finger of\na liquid Helium flow cryostat, and cooled down to a temperature of 5\nK.\n\nFigure \\ref{wav} shows low excitation photoluminescence (PL) spectra\n(solid curves) for the $n$-type sample, panel (a), and for the\n$p$-type sample, panel (b), demonstrating mostly emission from the\nQD ground state transitions. The PL has its maximum at 1.398 eV (887\nnm) for the $n$-type QDs, and at 1.381 eV (898 nm) for the $p$-type\nQDs.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{WavelengthDependence.eps}\n        \\caption{(a) Low excitation PL and spin noise power, i.e. area under the SNS, as functions of the probe wavelength for the $n$-doped QD sample;\n        (b) the same for the $p$-doped sample. The slight red shift of the spin noise compared to the PL for the n-doped sample\n        may result from a concentration of singly charged dots on the low energy side, while towards higher energies the dots become\n        increasingly uncharged. The blue shift in case of the p-doped sample, on the other hand, may result from a double charging of\n        the low energy dots with a pair of holes forming a spin zero singlet state. Towards the high energy side single\n        resident hole spin charging occurs in the dots, resulting in an increase of spin noise. This\n        increased p-doping level is confirmed by the increased intensity of emission from excited states compared to the n-doped sample.}\n        \\label{wav}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe linearly polarized probe light is taken from a tunable\ncontinuous wave (cw) Titanium-Sapphire ring laser emitting a single\nfrequency laser line with a linewidth of < 10\\,MHz. The laser is\nthen guided through a single mode optical fiber for spatial mode\nshaping ($\\text{TEM}_{00}$). After a Glan-Taylor polarizer providing\na linear extinction ratio of 10$^5$, the beam is transmitted through\nthe sample with a large area focus of 100~micrometers diameter, in\norder to minimize optical excitation effects in the QD\nensemble~\\cite{yl2012,sp1}.\n\nDetection of the Faraday rotation noise is done with a standard\npolarimeter, consisting of a Wollaston prism and a broadband optical\nbalanced detector. Two different detectors are used to study slower\nand faster dynamics: one has a bandwidth of 40 kHz $\\div$ 650 MHz\n(New Focus 1607-AC) requiring optical powers of typically a few\nmilliwatts (\\emph{fast} detector), while the other one (Femto HCA-S)\ncovers a bandwidth of DC $\\div$ 100 MHz, requiring powers of a few\nhundreds of microwatts (\\emph{slow} detector). The output of the\ndetectors is amplified and low-pass filtered at variable cutoff\nfrequencies to avoid undersampling, and then sent to the input of a\ndigitizer. The digitizer incorporates field programmable gate array\n(FPGA) technology for real time computation of the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) of the digitized voltage samples. The maximum\nbandwidth is limited at 1\\,GHz, providing 16384 spectral lines at a\nspectral resolution of 61.04 kHz. If necessary, the bandwidth can be\nreduced down to 200 MHz with a resolution of 12.21 kHz. For even\nhigher resolution as required, e.g., in the case of zero and\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements, spectra could be also\nacquired with a PCIe digitizer card installed in a computer, in\ncombination with multicore FFT processing and averaging. In this\nwork, the signal accumulation times varied between 1 minute and 30\nminutes, depending on the overall noise signal amplitude.\n\nFigure~\\ref{wav} shows, in addition to the PL spectra discussed\nabove, the integrated spin noise power, i.e. the area under the spin\nnoise power density spectrum (SNS), $\\int_0^\\infty d\\omega\n(\\vartheta_F^2)_\\omega$, as function of the probe wavelength for\nboth samples. The spin noise power nearly follows the PL line, with\nmaxima at 889 nm for the $n$-type sample and at 896 nm for the\n$p$-type sample. This is the typical behaviour for inhomogeneously\nbroadened ensembles~\\cite{vz2013}. Thus the laser is tuned into the\nabsorption band to provide measurable noise signal.\n\nUsing electromagnets we are able to apply magnetic fields, in the\nlongitudinal direction (Faraday geometry, along the growth direction\nof the sample) up to $B_{z,max}$ = 120 mT and in the transverse\ndirection (Voigt geometry) up to $B_{x,max}$ = 350 mT. In order to\nremove the spin-independent contribution to $(\\vartheta_F^2)_\\omega$\nfrom the overall photon shot noise and the intrinsic electronic\nnoise, the spin noise measurements were interleaved between two\nmagnetic fields: one measurement with the desired strength and\ndirection, and the other one applied in the Voigt geometry at $B_{x}\n\\geqslant$ 250 mT for shifting the precession peak out of the\ndetectable bandwidth. Subtraction of both spectra then yields the\npure spin noise contribution. In order to account for the frequency\ndependent sensitivity of the detectors, the noise power spectra were\nadditionally normalized by the photon shot noise power spectra\nmeasured without the sample, with the laser radiation shone directly\nonto the detectors.\n\n\n\\section{Results and Discussions}\\label{sec:discussion}\n\nIn this section we present the experimental data for the spin noise\nmeasurements in zero and finite transversal or longitudinal magnetic\nfields. Furthermore we provide the results of the simulations using\nthe two theoretical approaches and discuss their limitations and\nadvantages.\n\nNote that for convenient comparison with the experiment we present \ncharacteristic frequencies of the two models, such as $\\delta_e$ and $\\delta_h$, \nas well as Larmor frequencies and simulated spin noise spectra, in units of MHz, \ni.e. in units of an ordinary frequency, rather than by an angular frequency as used in the models. \n\n\\subsection{Spin noise at zero magnetic field}\\label{sec:zeroB}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics{ZeroField-expth.eps}\n\\caption{SNS measured on the (a) $n$-doped and the (b) $p$-doped QD\nsamples at zero external magnetic field using a probe power of 4~mW\n(50~W/cm$^2$) with the fast detector.

Panels (c) and (d) show\nadditionally fits (red curve) to the experimental data with the\nsemiclassical model using the parameters $\\delta_e=70$~MHz,\n$\\tau_s^e=5$~ns, $\\delta_h=40$~MHz, $\\lambda_h=10$, $\\tau_s^h=80$~ns\n(c) and $\\tau_s^h=240$~ns~(d).

The dash-dotted red curves in panels (e) and (f) indicate fits\nobtained with the CET. The CET results are calculated assuming\n$\\lambda_h=5$, $\\delta_{e} = $ 110 MHz and $\\delta_{h} = $ 16 MHz.\nThe electron fraction for the $n$-doped sample is set to $80\\,\\%$,\nand to $15\\,\\%$ for the $p$-doped sample.

All further parameters are chosen as\ndiscussed in section~\\ref{sec:quantum}. } \\label{zf}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{zf} compares the spin noise spectra for $n$- and\n$p$-doped QDs, left and right column of panels, respectively,\nmeasured at zero external magnetic field. For these experiments we\nused the fast detector and the FPGA module to cover a broad\nfrequency range.\n\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{zf}(b), the spin noise in the $p$-doped sample\nconsists of a single peak centered around zero frequency. In the\nchosen log-log scale representation we find that the curve closely\nfollows a Lorentzian in the frequency domain (shown additionally by\nthe dash-dotted line), which corresponds to an exponential decay in\ntime~\\cite{yl2012}. The spin noise spectrum of the $n$-doped sample reveals, in\naddition to the zero-frequency peak, a pronounced ``shoulder''\n(termed in the following as precession peak or Overhauser peak) at a frequency\nof $\\sim 100$\\,MHz, as highlighted by the red arrow in\nFig.~\\ref{zf}(a). This peak is related to the magnetic field caused\nby the intrinsic nuclear fluctuations, that act on the electrons as\na constant (frozen) magnetic field pointing along a random\ndirection. The electron spin components parallel to the frozen\nnuclear field contribute to the zero-frequency peak in the signal\nwith $1/3$ of the full spin polarization. The other $2/3$ precess\naround the nuclear field and are thus seen as the precession\npeak~\\cite{glazov:review}. The absence of such a shoulder in the\nhole spin ensemble signal is a direct indication of the anisotropic\nnature of the hole-nuclear interaction~\\cite{mg2012}.\n\nThe relative amplitude of the precession peak and the zero-frequency peak is\ninfluenced by several factors: (i) finite correlation time of the\nelectron in a quantum dot which might be caused, i.e., by the\nprobe-assisted transfer of the electrons into other QDs, providing a\nredistribution of the spin noise power of the precession\npeak towards the zero-frequency peak~\\cite{Glazov_hopping}, or (ii)\npresence of positively charged QDs in the nominally $n$-doped\nsample, which would increase the relative weight of the zero-frequency peak. In particular, the latter can be\ntested by applying a transverse magnetic field, as will be shown in\nthe Sec.~\\ref{sec:trans:B}. It should be foreclosed at this point, that\nby applying this method we were able to evidence a percentage of about 20 $\\%$ of such non-intentionally $p$-doped QDs,\nwhich is mostly due to impurities in the MBE machine.\nHowever, this value slightly varies with the point at which the sample is probed\nby the laser. Thus, to reproduce the data in the\nsemiclassical model, we assume that the\nratio of electron and hole contributions to the measured SNS is\n$\\mathcal AN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h)=4$, see Eq.~\\eqref{theta:F}. The\ncorresponding fit results for the $n$-doped sample are presented in\nFig.~\\ref{zf}(c), from which we can determine $\\delta_e\\approx\n70$~MHz and $\\tau_s^e=5$~ns, which is consistent with estimations\nbased on the hyperfine coupling constants,\nEq.~\\ref{eq:def-delta-mu}. For the hole fraction in the same sample\nbest agreement was achieved with $\\delta_h=40$~MHz, $\\lambda_h=10$ and\n$\\tau_s^h=80$~ns.\n\nThe best agreement with the experimental data using the\nsemiclassical model for the $p$-doped sample, see the red curve in\nFig.~\\ref{zf}(d), is obtained by using the parameters\n$\\delta_h=40$~MHz and $\\lambda_h=10$ in Eq.~\\eqref{OmegaN}, as well\nas $\\tau_s^h=240$~ns in Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} (note\nthat the curve is practically insensitive to a particular value of\n$\\delta_h$ provided that $\\delta_h/\\lambda_h < 5$~MHz)  \n\nThe panels (e) and (f) of Fig.~\\ref{zf} show a direct comparison\nbetween the experimental data and the numerical results obtained via\nthe CET approach. The spin noise function obtained via the CET is\nhighly sensitive to the choice of the model parameters introduced in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:quantum}. For electron spins, panel (e), the agreement\nbetween theory and experiment in the numerically accessible regime\nis excellent. The pronounced deviation at small frequencies stems\nfrom the finite frequency resolution of the CET above\n$0.79\\,\\text{MHz}$ for the parameters used here.\n\nThe agreement between theory and experiment is less striking for the\nhole doped sample, where the theoretically determined gradient of\nthe spin noise function in the intermediate frequency regime\n$0.79\\,\\text{MHz} < \\nu < 6\\,\\text{MHz}$ does not reproduce the\nexperiment exactly. We attribute that discrepancy to the small\namount of nuclei in the CET simulations limiting the low frequency\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian~\\eqref{Ham}. The obtained agreement\nbetween experiment and theory is still remarkably good within the\nfinite size limitations of the CET and \nstates the validity of the\napplied model. \nAll important parameters obtained from describing the\nexperimental data using the two models are summarized in\nTable~\\ref{tab:1}. \n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\vspace{-0.3cm} \\caption{SCA and CET parameters determined from the\nzero magnetic field data which are consistently used also\nsubsequently in describing the data in magnetic field.}\\label{tab:1}\n\\begin{ruledtabular}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n& SCA & CET \\\\\n\\hline\n$\\delta_e$\\,(MHz) & 70 & 110 \\\\\n$\\delta_h$\\,(MHz) & 40 & 16 \\\\\n$\\lambda_h$ & 10 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{ruledtabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Long-time spin dephasing at zero field}\\label{sec:zeroB:long}\n\nAs a nearly non-perturbative method of measurement, spin noise\nshould be able to unveil the intrinsic spin lifetimes in the studied\nsystems. However, the inhomogeneously broadened QD ensembles require\nthe probe energy to be within the PL-emission band. Therefore, one\nhas to pay special attention to the applied laser power and use the\nlimit of lowest possible laser intensities to minimize excitation\neffects. As could be shown by Yan Li \\textit{et al.} for hole spins\nin a very similar sample, for the used large 100\\,$\\mu$m laser spot\nand used probe powers in the range of 0.1\\,mW, the QD spin noise\nshows only a weakly increasing linewidth of the zero-frequency\npeak with increasing probe power~\\cite{yl2012,sp1}. This shows, that\nprobe induced effects are still present, but are minimized. A linear\nfit of the linewidth power dependence should thus allow us to obtain\na rather accurate value of the intrinsic spin relaxation time by\nextrapolating the fit to zero probe power. This method was recently\nproven to give reliable results for the electron spin relaxation times\nin pump-probe studies~\\cite{prb2015_on_T1}.\n\nIn our experiments, the zero-frequency peak in the spin noise of the\n$n$- and $p$-doped sample is measured using the slow 100\\,MHz\ndetector. Its output is filtered for the frequency band from 0.01 MHz\nto 32\\,MHz and then sent through a high frequency amplifier. The\nprobe laser powers range from 0.1\\,mW to 0.6\\,mW. Since especially\nthe lineshape of the SNS from the $n$-doped QDs deviates from\nLorentzian (see above), we use a general definition of the\nlinewidth, namely the geometrical half width at half maximum (HWHM)\nof the zero-frequency peak spectrum, denoted as $\\Gamma$, see also\nRef.~\\cite{yl2012}.\n\nThe effective linewidths extracted from our experimental data are\ndepicted in Fig.~\\ref{ltd}. We observe a weak increase of the\nlinewidths with laser power in both samples. However, the changes\nare much larger for the $n$-doped QDs. This partly originates from\nthe much smaller spectral amplitudes of the zero-frequency peak as\ncompared to the $p$-doped QDs, for which the complete spin noise\npower is concentrated in the zero-frequency peak.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{HWHM-zeropeak.eps}\n        \\caption{Dependence of the HWHM of the zero-frequency spin noise peak on probe laser power. The data exhibit a weak\n        linear increase with power in both cases, whereupon for the $n$-doped sample the increase is a factor 2.5 stronger.\n        The larger error is caused by a much smaller spectral amplitude compared to that of the $p$-doped sample.\n        We determine the effective intrinsic spin lifetime in both samples by using the point of intersection of the linear fits\n        with the vertical axis at zero laser power.}\n        \\label{ltd}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFrom linear fits to the power dependences we obtain the following\nintrinsic linewidths: the $p$-doped sample obeys $\\Gamma =\n(0.35\\pm0.01)$\\,MHz, whereas $\\Gamma = (0.39\\pm0.03)$\\,MHz for the\n$n$-doped sample. The linear increase of the linewidth is steeper\nfor the n-doped dots: it grows by $40 \\%$ as the probe power is\nincreased from 0.1\\,mW to 0.6\\,mW. For hole spins we observe an\nincrease of only $10 \\%$ within the same range of laser power. This\ndifference shall be studied in greater detail in future, here we\npoint out only some related aspects. First, as has been already\nmentioned above, there is a finite fraction of $p$-doped QDs in the\nintentionally $n$-doped sample, which amounts to about 20 \\%.\nSince at zero external field $2/3$ of the electron spin noise is\nconcentrated in the precession peak and only $1/3$\ncontributes to the zero-frequency peak, holes then may contribute up\nto 40 \\% to the spin noise of the zero-frequency peak, while the\nremaining 60 \\% stems from electrons. Thus, there is a significant\nhole contribution that may influence spectral shape and amplitude of\nthe low-frequency SNS from the $n$-doped sample. Second, both\nsamples are measured under exactly the same probing conditions,\nespecially with the same large laser spot of 100\\,$\\mu$m that\nevidently produces only a weak perturbation of the spin system. We\nprove this assumption by additionally looking at the FR noise\namplitude, which is the square root of the FR noise power, obtained\nby integration of the SNS from 0.012\\,MHz to 32\\,MHz. Taking the\ndependence of the FR noise amplitude on the probe laser power, we\nobtain an exponent of $\\approx 0.85$ for both samples by fitting the\ndependence with a power law. This value is quite close to unity,\nsuggesting that the measurements were carried out close to thermal\nequilibrium, i.e., close to the non-perturbative regime~\\cite{sp1}.\nAs an example of the opposite case, Ref.~\\cite{rd2012} showes\nsignatures of strong optical perturbation, demonstrating the hole\nspin noise in a QD microcavity with the measurements carried out\nusing $10^3 \\div 10^4$ times larger probe intensity than in our\ncase. The linewidth then is increased by a factor of 3, i.e. by 200 \\%\nunder a threefold increase of laser power. This additionally\ncorroborates that our measurements are performed largely\nnon-perturbatively.\n\nUsing the well-known relation $\\tau_s = (2\\pi \\Gamma)^{-1}$ we\nderive the effective spin lifetimes. We obtain $\\tau_s^p$ =\n0.46~$\\mu$s for the $p$-doped sample, and $\\tau_s^n$ = 0.41~$\\mu$s\nfor the $n$-doped sample. These values are close to the known result of\n$\\tau_s^h$ = 0.4~$\\mu$s that was obtained in the\nRefs.~\\cite{yl2012,sp1}. At first glance it is quite surprising that\nelectrons and holes have similar relaxation times, as they show a\nstrong difference in the nuclear interaction strength. Otherwise, similar\nvalues for the spin decoherence time $T_2$ of QD electron and hole\nspins in magnetic field were revealed by the mode-locking technique\napplied to similar $n$- and $p$-doped\nheterostructures~\\cite{prb87Varwig}. As we will explain in the following,\nour observation of comparable timescales is related to the presence of additional quadrupolar interactions\nof the nuclei with electric field gradients in the dots, Eq.~\\eqref{hqc}.\n\nWithout ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$, the characteristic time scale\nfor the electron spin noise is given by $T^*_e \\propto 1/\\delta_e$,\nand the one for hole spins by $T^*_h \\propto  \\lambda_h /\\delta_h$\ndetermined by the fluctuations of the Overhauser field\n\\eqref{eq:def-delta-mu}. While $T^*_e\\approx 1-2$ ns is found in the\ntypical QD ensembles as investigated here, the $p$-wave nature of\nthe hole-wave function reduces the hyperfine couplings $A_k^h$ by a\nfactor of 10 compared to the electron spins\n\\cite{Fermi1930,Fischer2008,testelin}.  The decay of $S_{h,z}$ is\nadditionally suppressed by the anisotropy parameter $\\lambda_h\\approx\n10$, accounting for the anisotropic dipole-dipole coupling of hole\nspins to the nuclear spins \\cite{Fermi1930,Fischer2008,testelin}, so\nthat $T^*_h\\approx 100 T^*_e$.  \n\nIncluding a realistic modeling \\cite{bulutay} of the\ncoupling between the nuclei's quadrupole moments and the electric\nfield gradients (EFGs) in the QDs via  ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ is\nsufficient to explain the observed mismatch between the experiments\nand the prediction of the CSM, see also Ref.~\\cite{jh2015}.  This\ncan be intuitively understood: adding an additional source of\ndecoherence (i.e.~the quadrupole interaction) to the CSM Hamiltonian\nresults in a decrease of the coherence time of the considered\nelectron/hole spins.\n\nWithout ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$, the total spin component in $z$-direction,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat J_z^{\\rm tot} &=& \\hat S_{\\mu,z} + \\sum_k \\hat I_z^{(k)}\n,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nis a conserved operator in the CSM provided that $\\bm{\\Omega}_B^{{\\mu}} = 0$ or $\\bm{\\Omega}_B^{{\\mu}} \\parallel z$,\nimplying that each individual nucleus maintains its state until the next spin-flip process occurs,\nalways involving a combined carrier and nuclear spin flip.\n\nAdding ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ breaks this conservation law for $\\hat\nJ_z^{\\rm tot}$ in the CSM by allowing spin-flips in the nuclear spin\nbath without involving the electronic spin, and defines an additional\nlong-time scale set by the coupling strength ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$. Its\neffect onto the spin-noise function can be investigated in fourth\norder perturbation theory \\cite{HackmannPhD2015} for fixed nuclear\neasy-axis vectors $\\vec{n}^{(k)}_z=\\vec{e}_z$: a term linear in\n$q_k$ and cubic in $A_k^\\mu$ accelerates the decay of $S_{\\mu,z}$\nbut a $q_k^2$ term decelerates the spin decay.  We note that the\ninfluence of ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ onto the decay of the electronic\nspin is indirect and only occurs in combination with the hyperfine\ninteraction. Its effect is non-universal and cannot be casted into a\nsimple decay time or energy scale as defined by the fluctuation of\nthe Overhauser field \\eqref{eq:def-delta-mu}.  The reason is related\nto its two opposite limits. For $A_k> q_k$, typically relevant for\nthe experiment, ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ provides additional nuclear\nspin-flip processes leading to an additional spin decay at long time\nscales set by $Q_r$, Eq.~\\eqref{Qr}, as outlined above. For the opposite limit,\n$A_k\\ll q_k$, the nuclear system must be diagonalized first,\nproviding a set of two time-reversal doublets as the new eigenbasis\nfor each nuclear spin energetically separated by $2q_k\\sqrt{1+\\eta^2\n4/3}$. Then the coupling to the electron/hole spin is treated\nperturbatively, and the rigidity of the nuclear system can suppress\nadditional dephasing for $\\eta\\to 0$ \\cite{HackmannPhD2015,Wu2015}.\n\nSince the $\\vec{n}^{(k)}_z$ have different strain induced\norientations at each nuclei in a real QD, their angular distribution\n\\cite{bulutay} and the in-plane anisotropy $\\eta$, however, provide\nan additional source of randomness and, hence, spin dephasing even\nfor stronger hyperfine coupling due to the misalignment of the local\nnuclear easy-axis and the growth orientation, defining the global\n$z$-axis. \n\nCrucial for the understanding of the comparable long-time\nspin decay of electron spins and hole spins is the fact that ${\\cal\nH}_{N}^\\mu$ is caused by the growth induced strain in the QDs, and\nits energy scale is consequently independent of the QD doping.  This\nadditional source of decoherence counteracts the lifetime\nenhancement of a factor $10\\lambda_h$ as predicted within the CSM\nfor hole spins. The quantum mechanical CET predicts \\cite{jh2015}\nthat the long-term lifetime is of the same order of magnitude for\n$n$-type and $p$-type QDs grown under identical growth conditions,\nas demonstrated in Fig.\\ \\ref{zf}(e) and (f).\n\nAt values $Q_r\\approx 6$ as used in Fig.\\ \\ref{zf}(f), the nuclear\nquadrupole electric couplings become the limiting factor of the\ncoherence time in zero magnetic field.\n\nOn a semiclassical level, the influence of the additional\nquadrupolar couplings can be understood \nby investigating the equation of motion\nof a single nuclear spin in the Hamiltonian \\eqref{Ham} coupled to a fictitious static carrier spin.\nWithin the CSM only,  the nuclear spin would precess around this central spin \nwith a Larmor  frequency proportional to \nthe individual $A_k^\\mu$. This leads to slow dynamics of the Overhauser field \\cite{merkulov02}\nand a long-time carrier  spin decay described by a power law \\cite{CoishLoss2004,jh2014-1} with some logarithmic\ncorrections governing the low frequency part of the spin-noise spectra. Adding the quadrupolar couplings\n${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ has two effects on the nuclear spin dynamics: firstly it enhances the\nnuclear Larmor frequency, and, secondly, the breaking of the total spin conservation law\ntranslates into a change of an effective precession axis which is not longer\ndetermined by the carrier spin direction only. Both effects yields to an addition dephasing of the \nOverhauser field and consequently to a dephasing of the non-decaying \nfraction of the spin-correlation function \\cite{uhrig2014} on a time scale dominated by the quadrupolar\ncoupling strength.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Spin noise in transverse magnetic fields}\\label{sec:trans:B}\n\nA magnetic field applied perpendicular to the probe beam propagation\ndirection, $\\bm B \\parallel x$ (Voigt geometry), induces spin\nprecession and shifts the corresponding noise peak along the\nfrequency axis to the Larmor frequency $\\Omega_B^\\mu$. We have\ncarried out measurements for electron and hole spins up to field\nstrengths of $B_x = 80$~mT, using the fast 650\\,MHz photodetector\nwith a probe power of 4\\,mW. The experimental results are presented\nin Fig.~\\ref{elpr} panel (a) for the $p$-type sample and panel (b)\nfor the $n$-type sample.\n\nWe start the analysis with the data on the $p$-type sample, shown in\npanel (a). At $B_x\\ne 0$ the SNS consists of two peaks: the first\none remains centered at $\\omega=0$, but its amplitude decreases with\nincreasing magnetic field, and the second one appears at $\\omega \\ne\n0$, shifting with the field towards higher frequencies, in agreement\nwith our expectations, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:semiclass}, because the\ntransverse magnetic field suppresses the role of the nuclear field\nfluctuations, therefore reducing the zero-peak contribution. The\nexperimental data are adequately described by the semiclassical\nmodel, Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class}, using the following values of fit\nparameters: transverse hole $g$-factor $g_h^\\perp=0.16$, measured\nfrom the linear shift of the second peak maximum with magnetic\nfield, $g$-factor spread of $\\approx 37$~\\%, measured from the\nbroadening of the peak, and $\\tau_s^h\\approx 16$~ns for $B_x\\geqslant\n20$~mT, see the solid curves in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a) for results. To achieve\nbetter agreement between experiment and theory at $B_x=0$ the curve \ncentered at zero frequency is calculated with a longer spin relaxation\n$\\tau_s^{h,0}\\approx 240$~ns. This extension of the spin relaxation\ntime by the magnetic field is beyond the scope of the semiclassical\nmodel and demonstrates its limitations.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{TransverseField.eps}\n        \\caption{(a) SNS measured on the $p$-doped QD sample in the transverse magnetic fields indicated in the legend.\n\t\t\t\tThe acronym \"PSN\" means \"photon shot noise\".\n        Fits with the semiclassical model are shown by the solid lines at $B_x$ = 40\\,mT and 80\\,mT. The heavy hole\n        $g$-factor is $g_h^\\perp=0.16$ with a spread of 37\\%.

All other CET parameters except the hole $g$-factor\n        spread are the same as in Fig.\\ \\ref{zf}.}\n        \\label{elpr}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nTo illustrate further the validity of the semiclassical model at\nnon-zero fields and to analyze the interplay of the nuclear spin\nfluctuations and the external magnetic field in more detail, we plot\nthe ratio of the area under the zero-frequency SNS peak to the area\nunder the whole SNS for an extended range of field strengths up to\n$B_x$ = 120 mT, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:Zero}. The area of the zero-frequency peak was extracted by fitting the SNS by a linear\ncombination of a Gaussian function centered at $\\omega\\ne 0$ and two\nLorentzians centered at $\\omega=0$ with different widths. The\nGaussian function is needed to account for the non-zero frequency\nspin precession peak and the two Lorentzians reflecting exponential\ndecays in time are needed to reproduce rather accurately the shape\nof the zero-frequency component whose precise calculation is beyond\nthe scope of the semiclassical model. The Gaussian is characteristic\nfor a behavior determined by an inhomogeneous distribution such as\nthe $g$-factor variations \\cite{mg2012}. Figure~\\ref{fig:Zero} demonstrates good\nagreement between theory and experiment.\n\nNext we turn to the SNS of the $n$-type QD sample in transverse\nmagnetic field, shown in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(b). Here, at $B_x\\ne 0$ one\ncan see two features in the SNS appearing at non-zero frequencies.\nOne of them correlates with the hole Larmor precession,\nFig.~\\ref{elpr}(a), while the other one has much higher frequency\nand can be attributed to the electrons. As mentioned above, the ratio of the areas under\nthese two peaks is slightly sensitive to the particular point of the sample that is probed by the laser.\n \nThis observation supports our conjecture\nthat $n$- and $p$-doped quantum dots coexist in the nominally\n$n$-type sample, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:zeroB}. Hence, as in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:zeroB}, to describe the experimental data within the\nsemiclassical model we take into account contributions of electron\nand hole spins to the measured SNS. The particular data in\nFig.~\\ref{elpr}(b) are well described by Eqs.~\\eqref{theta:F} and\n\\eqref{sns:class}, see solid curves in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(b),\ncalculated using a fraction of positively charged QDs, $\\mathcal\nAN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h)\\approx 4$.\nOther fit parameters are chosen as follows: $g_e^\\perp = 0.55$, its\nspread is about $7$~\\%, and $\\tau_s^e=5$~ns, taken independent on\n$B_x$. We note that such a short value of $\\tau_s^e$ is introduced\ninto the semiclassical model to approximate the relatively broad\nzero-frequency contribution in the SNS. An analysis of the\n``intrinsic'' electron spin relaxation time is presented below in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:longB}.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{elpr} we demonstrate the agreement between the\nexperimental results and the CET for transversal external fields.\nThe CET parameters are set to those of the zero-field calculation\nused in Fig.~\\ref{zf}. The comparison between the experimental\nresults and the CET data (dashed lines) for $B = 60\\,\\text{mT}$ \nserves as a proof of principle assuring comparable results for the\nremainder experimental data. For the $p$-type samples, the\nelectron-spin contribution to the spectrum is negligible, and the\nCET reproduces the obtained hole-spin spectrum at all frequency\nranges in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a).\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{ZeroPeak.eps}\n        \\caption{Analysis of the relative spectral area of the zero-frequency peak as a function of transverse magnetic field\n        calculated for the $p$-doped sample using the semiclassical approach.

The solid curve is calculated using Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} with the same\n        set of parameters as Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a).}\n        \\label{fig:Zero}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs noted above, the SNS of $n$-type samples shows a shallow\nlow-frequency feature tracing perfectly the spin-noise peak of the\n$p$-type samples with increasing magnetic field. Due to the $\\sim\n20\\,\\%$ admixture of holes to the $n$-doped spectrum, the hole SNS\nprovides an additional finite low-frequency contribution around the\nhole Larmor frequency that is accurately reproduced by the CET\napproach as shown in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(b). As previously\ndemonstrated~\\cite{mg2012,jh2014-1}, the width of the spin\nprecession peak is mainly governed by the parameter $\\delta_\\mu$ at\nsmall and moderate fields, while at higher fields it is controlled\nadditionally by the $g$-factor spread; the peak shape is\napproximately Gaussian for $\\Omega_B \\gg \\delta_\\mu$.\n\nThe transversal magnetic field reduces the non-decaying fraction of\nthe spin-correlation function responsible for the zero-frequency\n$\\delta$-peak in the spin-noise spectrum. Consequently spectral\nweight is transferred to finite frequencies to fulfil the spectral\nsum rule~\\cite{mg2012,jh2014-1,oest:nsn}, which describes the\nconservation of a total number of fluctuating spins. This is clearly\nvisible in the $p$-type spectra shown in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a). Such a\nsuppression is also found in $n$-type samples. \n\nSynopsis of the transverse-field results shows that the data in\nFigs.~\\ref{elpr} and \\ref{fig:Zero} can be well described by both\nmodels, the semiclassical and the quantum-mechanical one.\n\n\n\\subsection{Spin noise in longitudinal magnetic fields}\\label{sec:longB}\n\nUnder application of a magnetic field along the light propagation\naxis the role of transverse fluctuations of the Overhauser field\ndiminishes. This leads to: (i) suppression of the precession peak, and (ii) modification of the\nzero-frequency peak amplitude and shape. As noted above, the total\narea under the noise spectrum remains constant and does not depend\non magnetic field due to conservation of the number of spins in the\nprobed volume. \n\nIn this section we focus on the zero-frequency peak.\nThis allows/requires (i)\nusage of the highly sensitive slow detector with low probe laser\npowers to minimize optical excitation effects and (ii) detailed\nmonitoring of zero-frequency peak modifications because of higher\nspectral resolution. In particular, we filtered the detector output\nvoltage for the frequency band between 0.009 MHz\nand 17.5 MHz.\n\nThe suppression of the precession peak in the\n$n$-doped sample then becomes indirectly observable by changes of\nthe integral spectral area of the zero-frequency peak, as for higher\nlongitudinal fields the spins become stabilized and redistributed in\nfrequency into the zero-peak component.\n\nFigure~\\ref{lonspec} shows the low-frequency SNS of the $n$-type\nsample, panel (a), and of the $p$-type sample, panel (b), measured\nat 0.2 mW probe laser power for different values of the longitudinal\nmagnetic field. It was our aim to measure both samples under\ncomparable probing conditions with the lowest possible laser power.\nThe chosen low probe laser power is dictated by the small noise\namplitude in the selected frequency range for the $n$-doped sample\nat zero external field, because the nuclear field distributes 2/3 of\nthe total spectral weight of the electron spin noise into the\nOverhauser precession peak (not shown).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{LongFieldSpectra-exp.eps}\n        \\caption{SNS measured on the (a) $n$-doped and (b) $p$-doped QD ensemble at different longitudinal magnetic fields\n        using a probe laser power of 0.2 mW, see legend for the field strengths. The black dashed lines illustrate the $1/f$-asymptotics.}\n        \\label{lonspec}\n\\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe experimental data clearly demonstrate the enhancement of the\nzero-frequency peak with increasing magnetic field. The spectra of\nboth samples transform towards a $1/f$ behaviour of the SNS at\nsufficiently high field strengths, as reported previously for a\n$p$-doped sample~\\cite{yl2012}. This indicates a crossover to a\n$1/\\ln{t}$ spin decay in time, which is especially noteworthy for\nthe $n$-doped sample, since the longitudinal field redistributes\nelectron spin fluctuations from the Overhauser precession peak into\nthe zero-frequency peak (see below), such that at the maximum\napplied field strength the electron spin contribution to the zero-frequency peak clearly dominates, despite the finite admixture from\n$p$-doped QDs. Thus, the crossover to $1/f$-noise can be termed a\ngeneral property of carrier spins in QDs, regardless of the type of\nresident carrier charge.\n\nTo obtain deeper insight into the complex dynamics of interacting\nelectron and nuclear spins we extract again the effective spin\nrelaxation times $\\tau_s$ from the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM)\nof the zero-frequency SNS component, see Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(a).\nSince the shape of the zero-frequency feature strongly deviates from\na Lorentzian, especially for sufficiently high magnetic fields where\n$1/f$ behavior dominates, such procedure only gives effective\ntimescales for the spin relaxation, as explained above in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:zeroB:long}.\n\nThe red dimonds in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(a) show the effective\nrelaxation times $\\tau_s^p$ for the $p$-doped QD sample. It abruptly\nincreases with increasing magnetic field up to $\\sim 10$\\,mT, from\n$\\sim 0.4$ $\\mu$s (consistent with the measurements shown in\nSecs.~\\ref{sec:zeroB}, \\ref{sec:trans:B}) to 5.3\\,$\\mu$s. The\nlongitudinal field overwhelms the anisotropic nonzero hyperfine\nfield experienced by the hole through the hole-nuclear coupling, and\nthus suppresses the hole spin dephasing due to hyperfine\ninteraction. For the magnetic field range from 20 mT to 120 mT,\n$\\tau_s^p$ slowly increases further up to about $6.5$~$\\mu$s,\nshowing signatures of saturation at the highest field strengths. We\nascribe this behaviour to a small fraction of non-intentionally\n$n$-doped QDs in this sample. Notably, the width of the dip in the\nmagnetic field dependence of the electron spin lifetime around zero\nfield should be considerably larger than that for holes. This is\nbecause the hyperfine field acting on the electron spin is stronger.\nHence, a larger external magnetic field is needed to overcome the\nhyperfine field. This assumption is supported by the spin lifetime\nbehaviour $\\tau_s^n(B_z)$ observed for the $n$-doped sample, see\nblack dots in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(a). The broad component is\nsignificantly more pronounced than in the $p$-doped sample. The\nnarrow dip for fields $|B_z| \\lesssim 10$~mT is ascribed to the\npresence of $p$-doped QDs in the $n$-type sample. The broad,\nelectron-induced component demonstrates a further increase in the\neffective electron spin lifetime to 5.6 $\\mu$s, showing also\npronounced signatures of saturation at $|B_z| = 120$\\,mT.\n\nAdditionally, with increasing magnetic field strength, the 2/3 of\ntotal spectral weight of electron spin noise contained at zero\nexternal field in the precession peak become continuously\nredistributed into the zero-frequency peak. In order to demonstrate this behaviour, we\nmade use of two facts: (i) a simple measure for the spectral weight of\nthe spin noise is provided by the area under the SNS, which in turn can be obtained\nfrom an integration, $\\int_{\\omega_1}^{\\omega_2}d\\omega\\left(\\vartheta_F^2\\right)_{\\omega}$;\n(ii) for the analysis of the redistribution, it is sufficient to monitor the increase of the spectral area\nunder the zero-frequency peak. Thus, we performed the integration of the SNS in the frequency range depcited in Fig.~\\ref{lonspec}, i.e. from 0.009 MHz\nto 10 MHz. \n\nFor our $n$-doped sample we finally obtain a dependence of the zero-frequency peak area on $B_z$ as depicted \nby the black dots in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b). The continuous redistribution of the spectral weight of the electron spin noise is clearly seen, whereupon\nsaturation occurs for $|B_z| \\geqslant$ 80 mT. In principle, the observed behaviour can be explained with the total\nlongitudinal field overcoming the transverse components of the\nnuclear hyperfine field that is isotropic in the n-doped QD ensemble, such that\nfinally an anisotropic total magnetic field acts on these QDs,\nshuffling all spectral weight of the electron spin noise into the\nzero-frequency peak, as is the case for hole spins~\\cite{mg2012}.\nHowever, the total increase of the zero-frequency peak area in\nthe $n$-doped sample amounts to a factor of $\\sim$2.3 only, instead\nof the expected factor of $3$~\\cite{mg2012}. This is in line\nwith the presence of $p$-doped QDs, and the spectral cutoff at the\nsmallest frequencies ($f < 0.009$ MHz).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{LongField-LifetimeArea.eps}\n        \\caption{Dependence of (a) the effective spin lifetime inferred from the HWHM of the zero-frequency peak SNS, and\n        (b) the area under the zero-frequency peak SNS    \n        of both QD samples on longitudinal field strength.\n        Each sample shows some characteristic features of a fraction of QDs in each ensemble being doped non-intentionally\n        with the other type of carrier spin, respectively. This is due to impurities incorporated during the growth process.}\n        \\label{arealifetime}\n\\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo complete the discussion of the experimental observations, we\naddress the dependence of the spin noise amplitude of the $p$-doped\nsample on the longitudinal field strength, see the red diamonds in\nFig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b). The absence of any pronounced dependence\non $B_z$ indicates that the amount of $n$-type quantum dots in this\nsample is rather small. Indeed, for $\\lesssim 10$~\\% of $n$-type\ndots their contribution to the zero-frequency peak amplitude can\nhardly be resolved within our experimental accuracy.\n\nSummarizing the experimental findings, we note that in sufficiently\nstrong magnetic fields (which suppress the frozen nuclear fields)\nboth types of carrier spins (i) demonstrate quite similar effective\nspin lifetimes, and (ii) show a trend towards a $1/\\ln{(t)}$ spin\ndecay manifesting itself as a $1/f$ behavior of the zero-frequency\npeak SNS.\n\nThe semiclassical model outlined in Sec.~\\ref{sec:semiclass}\nprovides an increase of $\\tau_s^h$ with increasing longitudinal\nmagnetic field if a finite value of the correlation time $\\tau_c$ is\ntaken into account. However, our estimations show that such an\nincrease should be observed at larger fields than observed, $B_z\n\\sim 20$~mT for the parameters extracted from the fits in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:trans:B}. Hence, such an abrupt increase as well as\nthe weak increase of the hole spin relaxation time at\n$\\Omega_B^\\mu>\\delta_\\mu$ should be analyzed in terms of the\ninterconnected hole and nuclear spin dynamics~\\cite{yl2012},\nquadrupolar splittings~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad} and, possibly, taking\ninto account other spin relaxation mechanisms unrelated to the\nhyperfine interaction~\\cite{Khaetskii1}. On the other hand, the\nsemiclassical model provides a reasonable description of the\nredistribution of the spectral weight of electron spin noise into the zero-frequency\npeak under longitudinal magnetic fields: taking the value of $\\delta_e=70$~MHz\nfrom the fitting of the zero-field SNS, Fig.~\\ref{zf}(c), as well as \n20 \\% of $p$-doped QDs, $AN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h) = 4$, we obtain\nthe red solid curve in Fig.~\\ref{lonfit} without any additional\nfitting parameters, giving fair accord with the measured data. Note,\nthat the value of the electron spin lifetime $\\tau_s^e$ only weakly\naffects the dependence of the zero-frequency peak area on the\nlongitudinal magnetic field.\n\n\nWithin the CSM, the suppression of the electron spin decoherence in\na longitudinal field $\\bm{B} \\parallel z$ with field strength\n$B_z = |\\bm{B}|$ leads to a rapid increase of the long-time\nlimit $S_\\infty(b) = \\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty} S_e(\\tau)$ of the spin\ncorrelation function $S_e(\\tau)$ defined in Eq.~\\eqref{Heisenberg}.\n$S_\\infty(b)$ is proportional to the spectral weight of the\nzero-frequency peak contribution, and its dependency on the dimensionless magnetic\nfield $b = \\Omega_B^eT_e^*$, with $\\Omega_B^e$\ndenoting the frequency of the Larmor precession induced by the longitudinal field ($\\bm{\\Omega}_B^e \\parallel z$), is given by the interpolation formula\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\tS_\\infty(b) &=& S_e(0) - \\frac{S_e(0)-S_\\infty(b=0)}{1+b^2}\n\\label{eq:s-infty}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nfor the $n$-type QDs~\\cite{HackmannPhD2015}, with $S_e(0)=1/4$ being the\ninitial value of the spin-correlation function \\eqref{spectrum0} at\ntime $t=0$, and $T_e^*\\propto 1/\\delta_e$ denoting the characteristic\ntimescale of the electron spin fluctuations (see above). Note, that Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty}\nholds in the SCA as well with an accuracy higher than $4~\\%$.\n\nWithin the quantum  mechanical approach~\\cite{jh2014-1} to the CSM\nit was found that (i) the spectral weight of the spin precession\npeak rapidly decays as $\\propto b^2$~\\cite{HackmannPhD2015}, (ii) the\nlow-frequency spectral weight ($1/\\tau_s^e \\ll \\omega \\ll \\delta_e$)\nis strongly reduced as well as (iii) collapsing into the\nzero-frequency peak~\\cite{jh2014-1,HackmannPhD2015} leading to Eq.\\\n\\eqref{eq:s-infty} for longitudinal magnetic fields. \n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{LonAreaNdoped-fit.eps}\n        \\caption{The red line shows a fit to the data shown in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b) using the semiclassical approach\n        with $\\delta_e = 70$\\,MHz and $AN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h) = 4$ as obtained from the zero-field and transverse-field SNS.\n        The blue line shows $S_\\infty(b)$ obtained from Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty}, under particular consideration of Eq.~\\eqref{b-alternative}, and with\n\t\t\t\tparameters $\\delta_e$ = 110 MHz and $S_e(0)/S_{\\infty}(b=0)$ = 2.14 consistent with the CET calculations added to Fig.~\\ref{zf}, as well as\n\t\t\t\t$S_e(0)$ = 0.08.}\n        \\label{lonfit}\n\\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe SNS shown in Fig.~\\ref{lonspec} suggests that the high energy\nparts of the spectrum are not solemnly transferred to the\nzero-frequency $\\delta$-peak as predicted by the CSM, but are\ndistributed over some finite low-frequency range obeying $1/f$\nbehaviour as shown in Fig.~\\ref{lonspec}.

Therefore, the mechanism governing the\nlow-frequency part of the spectrum must be the same for both types\nof QDs and nearly independent of the longitudinal magnetic field.\nThis serves as a piece of evidence that the nuclear quadrupolar\ncouplings, Eq.~\\eqref{hqc} and Refs.~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad,jh2015}\nprovide this mechanism: The quadrupolar splittings defined by the\nHamiltonian ${\\cal H}_{N}^{\\mu}$ are induced during the growth\nprocess~\\cite{bulutay} and are independent of doping. Moreover,\nsince the nuclear magnetic moment is about 2000 times smaller than\nthe Bohr magneton, the nuclear system remains almost unaffected by\nthe comparably weak longitudinal magnetic fields applied in our\nexperiments.\n\nReplacing the non-decaying fraction of the spin-correlation\nfunction~\\cite{uhrig2014} by the integral over the low-frequency\npart of the spectrum yields the same functional dependence of this\nsignal area on the longitudinal magnetic field as in Eq.\\\n\\eqref{eq:s-infty} for $n$-type QDs. In fact, identifying\n$S_\\infty(b)$ with the zero-frequency peak area in the SNS and\nsetting $S_\\infty(b=0)=S(0)/3$ using the SCA estimate\n~\\cite{merkulov02} precisely describes the increase of the zero-frequency peak \narea as function of the magnetic field, where $S_e(0)$ takes the\nrole of a prefactor fixed by the experiment. For the particular case\nof admixture from non-intentionally $p$-doped QDs as observed in our\nstudies, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty} should also remain suitable. Then\nthe parameters $S_\\infty(b=0)$ as well as $S_e(0)$\ninclude the same (field-independent) contributions from hole\nspins, respectively, such that the field-dependent part describes\nthe redistribution of electron spin noise from the Overhauser peak\ninto the zero-frequency peak, regardless of the amount of $p$-doped\nQDs in the sample.  \n \nIn order to find out whether the expression in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty} is sufficient to describe the data depicted in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b) under \nutilization of the CET parameters derived from the zero-field and transverse-field measurements ($\\delta_e$ = 110 MHz, $\\sim$20 \\% of hole doped QDs), we firstly\nderived a relation for the dimensionless magnetic field $b$ that contains both $\\delta_e$ and $B_z$. Therein, we put $\\Omega_B^e = \\hbar^{-1}g_e^{\\parallel}\\mu_BB_z$.    \nFurthermore, by taking $\\Omega_N^e$ to denote the Larmor frequency of the precession peak in the zero-field SNS, we can adopt (i) $\\Omega_N^e \\approx \\left(\\sqrt{2}T_e^*\\right)^{-1}$ as a major CET result \\cite{jh2014}, and (ii) $\\Omega_N^e = \\delta_e$ from the SCA \\cite{mg2012}, to obtain\n$T_e^* = \\left(\\sqrt{2}\\delta_e\\right)^{-1}$. In combination, the relation\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 23069, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\Omega_\\mu = |\\bm \\Omega_\\mu|$, $\\theta$ is the angle between\n$\\bm{\\Omega}_{\\mu}$ and the $z$-axis, and $\\tau_s^\\mu $ is the\nphenomenological spin relaxation time unrelated to the hyperfine\ninteraction, with $\\tau_s^\\mu \\gg 1/\\delta_\\mu$ as a rule. In QD\nensembles one has to average Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} over the\ndistributions of both the $g$-factors and the parameters\n$\\delta_\\mu$ as well as $\\lambda_\\mu$ characterizing the hyperfine\ninteraction, which are caused by the spread of QD sizes, shapes and\ncompositions~\\cite{mg2012,jh2014}.\n\nThe spin noise spectrum described by Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class}\ndemonstrates two peaks at $\\omega\\geqslant 0$ in\ngeneral~\\cite{mg2012}. The peak at positive frequencies is related\nwith the spin precession. At sufficiently small fields\n($\\Omega_B^\\mu \\ll \\delta_\\mu$) its position is determined by the\ncharacteristic frequency of spin precession in the field of nuclear\nspin fluctuations, $\\sim \\delta_\\mu$, whereas at high fields\n($\\Omega_B^\\mu \\gg \\delta_\\mu$) it is determined by the Larmor\nfrequency $\\Omega_B^\\mu$ of the spin precession about the external\nfield. The shape of the precession peak is determined by the\ndistribution function of the random nuclear fluctuations.\n\nThe peak at $\\omega=0$ in the noise spectrum is caused by the spin\ncomponents conserved during precession~\\cite{merkulov02,mg2012}. In\nthe semiclassical model outlined above this peak obeys a Lorentzian\nshape with the half width at half maximum (HWHM) being $\\tau_s^\\mu$.\nIn fact, the semiclassical treatment with frozen nuclear spins fails\nto accurately describe the low-frequency behavior of the spin noise,\nsince at low frequencies $\\omega \\ll \\delta_\\mu$ the nuclear\ndynamics becomes important. Generally, to describe the features of\nthe spin noise spectrum at low frequencies, a quantum mechanical\ntreatment as described in Sec.~\\ref{sec:quantum} is needed. Before\nexplaining this treatment in detail we briefly address some\nsituations in which the semiclassical approach can be used.\n\nBasically, the semiclassical treatment can be applied to study the\nspin noise at low frequencies $\\omega \\ll \\delta_\\mu$ if the\nelectron {(hole)} feedback on the nuclear spin dynamics can be\nneglected. Hence, the temporal evolution of electron {(hole)} and\n nuclear fluctuations are decoupled in Eq.~\\eqref{Heisenberg}.\nHowever, the dynamics of the nuclear spins can be included into\nconsideration also. In this situation, the electron spin precesses,\nin addition to the static external field, in a time-dependent\nnuclear field $\\bm \\Omega_N^\\mu(t)$. This can be realized in a\nsemiclassical treatment if the electron or the hole leaves its site\nof localization before nuclear spin precession takes place, i.e. due\nto hopping to a neighbouring empty QD or due to excitation to the\nwetting layer and consequent localization in another\ndot~\\cite{Glazov_hopping,oest:nsn}. Then the nuclear fields can be\ntreated as Gaussian random functions with correlation time $\\tau_c$,\nand analytical expressions for the spin noise spectrum can be\nderived, as shown in Ref.~\\cite{Glazov_hopping}. Another regime\nwhere the semiclassical approach can be still employed is the case\nof strong quadrupolar splittings of the nuclear spin states, $|q_k|\n\\gg |A_k^\\mu|$~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad}. In this case one can find all\ntemporal correlations of the nuclear fields, i.e. second order,\n$\\langle \\hat \\Omega_{N,\\alpha}^\\mu(\\tau)\\hat\n\\Omega_{N,\\beta}^\\mu(0)\\rangle$, and higher order correlators, from\nthe quadrupolar Hamiltonian~\\eqref{hqc} and then evaluate the\nelectron (hole) spin noise spectra semiclassically from the Bloch\nequations for the electron spin dynamics in a time-dependent\nmagnetic field. Provided that the correlation time $\\tau_c$ is\nfinite but long enough, $\\tau_c \\gg \\delta_\\mu$, the spin noise\nspectrum is described by Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} with some\n``effective'' spin relaxation $\\tau_s^\\mu$, which may be magnetic\nfield dependent. Particularly, at $B=0$ one has $\\tau_s^\\mu\\sim\n\\tau_c$~\\cite{Glazov_hopping}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum mechanical approach}\\label{sec:quantum}\n\nThe inaccurate description of the zero-frequency peak in the\nsemiclassical approach can be avoided using the quantum mechanical\ndefinition of the spin correlation functions,\nEq.~\\eqref{Heisenberg}, which we evaluate by applying the Chebyshev\npolynomial expansion technique (CET). It was originally developed as\na numerical tool to calculate the exact time evolution\n$\\exp{(-\\mathrm i \\mathcal H^\\mu \\tau)}|\\psi\\rangle$ of an\narbitrary, originally pure state $|\\psi\\rangle$ in a well defined\ntime interval $\\tau$~\\cite{TalEzer-Kosloff-84,Dobrovitski2003}. As\nrecently demonstrated~\\cite{jh2014,jh2014-1,jh2015}, it can also be\napplied to evaluate correlation functions as $(S_{\\mu,z}^2)_\\omega$\nby using the quantum typicality of random quantum\nstates~\\cite{Fehske-RMP2006}. The spin noise spectrum due to\nprecession of electrons in the Overhauser field at zero external\nmagnetic field, calculated by this quantum mechanical approach\nagrees well with the semiclassical result, Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class},\nand is only determined by the second moment $\\delta_\\mu$ of the\ndistribution function for the $A_k^\\mu$, i.\\ e.\\ Eq.\\\n\\eqref{eq:def-delta-mu}, and, if applied, by the external magnetic\nfield~\\cite{jh2014}.\n\nThe zero-frequency peak or more precisely the low-frequency spin\nnoise peak in the noise spectrum is governed by the interplay of the\nelectron or hole feedback on the nuclear spin dynamics, the\nnon-uniformity of the hyperfine\ninteraction~\\cite{merkulov02,Khaetskii} and the nuclear quadrupolar\ncouplings~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad,jh2015}. This interplay between the\nparameters $A_k^\\mu$, $\\lambda_\\mu$, $q_k$, $\\vec{n}^{(k)}$ and\n$\\eta$ of the Hamiltonian~\\eqref{Ham} has significant impact on the\nshape of the spin noise spectrum at small frequencies. A detailed\ndiscussion on the choice of the hyperfine coupling constants\n$A_k^\\mu$ used in the CET can be found in Ref.~\\cite{jh2014-1}. The\nparameters associated with the quadrupolar interaction are derived\nfrom recent microscopic studies of the electric field gradients in\n(In,Ga)As quantum dots~\\cite{bulutay} assuming an In concentration\nof $\\approx 40\\,\\%$. \nAlthough we only can include a small amount, $N\\approx 10$, of\nspin-$3/2$ nuclei in the quantum mechanical simulation, we generate\nthe coupling constants $q_k$ and the orientation vectors $\\vec{n}_k$\nfrom a distribution function reproducing the average values found in\nthe microscopic study by C.~Bulutay~\\cite{bulutay}. The average\ndeviation angle $\\theta_z$ between the orientation vectors\n$\\vec{n}_k$ is set to $\\approx 25^\\circ$. For  coupling constants\n$q_k = \\alpha x_k$, the random variable $x_k$ is drawn from a\nuniform probability distribution in the interval $x_k \\in [0.5:1]$,\nand the magnitude $\\alpha$ is determined by the ratio\n\n", "index": 23, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\tQ_r = \\frac{\\sum_k q_k}{\\sum_k A_k} \n\t\\label{Qr}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E12.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Q_{r}=\\frac{\\sum_{k}q_{k}}{\\sum_{k}A_{k}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>k</mi></msub><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>k</mi></msub><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03677.tex", "nexttext": "\nis yielded, which we then included into Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty}. Next, we accounted for 20 \\% of $p$-doped QDs by incorporating the ratio $S_e(0)/S_\\infty(b=0) = 2.14$, but left $S_e(0)$ as a free parameter to optimize the fit between experiment and theory. Finally, $g_e^{\\parallel} \\approx g_e^{\\perp} = 0.55$ is included. Under all aforementioned preconditions, we obtained the best agreement for $S_e(0) = 0.08$. The corresponding plot is depicted by the blue curve in Fig.~\\ref{lonfit}. As can be derived from this plot, the CET is well suited to describe our data. Especially, the good consistency of the model parameters obtained previously from the zero-field and the transverse-field measurements deserves particular attention.\n \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=85mm]{CETlongitudinalField.eps}\n \\caption{(color online) SNS of a hole doped QD calculated with the\nCET for $\\lambda_h = 4$ and $Q_r = 1$ in a varying longitudinal\nexternal field $\\bm{B} \\parallel z$, and for $\\delta_h=9.7$ MHz.\nFor the $B=0$ spectrum we supplemented a Lorentzian (dash-dotted line)\nwith a half width at half maximum of $\\Gamma = 1.25\\, \\text{MHz}$.\n}\n  \\label{fig-holes}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith this specific conclusion we turn the analysis to the $p$-type QDs.\nThe situation here is considerably different from the $n$-type QDs: due to the\nsignificant anisotropy factor $\\lambda_h$, the spin decay is\nsuppressed in the CSM: the Gaussian peak from the Overhauser field\nfluctuation is shifted to lower frequencies approximately by a\nfactor of $10$~\\cite{testelin} compared to $n$-type QDs and,\ntherefore, merges with the rest of the low frequency spectrum, as\nwas also shown in Fig.\\ 11 of Ref.~\\cite{jh2014-1}. In addition, its\narea is reduced due to the suppression of the spin decay via the\nhyperfine coupling. To this end, the depicted frequency range in\nFig.\\ \\ref{lonspec}(a) contains almost the complete spin noise, and,\nconsequently, the area remains constant within the experimental\nrestrictions as reported in Fig.\\ \\ref{arealifetime}(b) and in\naccordance with the spectral sum rule.\n\nFor a detailed comparison between the experiment and the CET\napproach for the full Hamiltonian~\\eqref{Ham}, the frequency\nresolution for the SNS must be matched. Since we have typically used\na fixed number of Chebyshev polynomials $N_c=6000$, and the energy\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian \\eqref{Ham} increases with increasing\nmagnetic field, the lowest accessible frequency in the CET approach\nalso increases with the applied magnetic field. Therefore, the CET\nhas very reliable access to the high-frequency part of the spectrum\nabove 1 MHz, while that part on the experimental side is\nunfortunately already disappearing in the detector noise. On the\nother hand, the CET approach lacks the necessary low-frequency\nresolution for $f <$ 1 MHz with increasing longitudinal magnetic\nfield, where the crossover to a $1/f$-type spin decay has been\ndetected in experiment as reported above.\n\nNevertheless, such a crossover has also been found in a longitudinal\nmagnetic field when applying the CET approach to the full\nHamiltonian \\eqref{Ham} for $p$-typed QDs. For the results presented\nin Fig.\\ \\ref{fig-holes}, however, we have used slightly different\nparameters than in Fig.\\ \\ref{zf} enabling us to reach lower\nfrequencies.\nSetting aside the\nincreased experimental noise, the qualitative and quantitative\nagreement remains remarkable between theory and experiment: (i) with\nincreasing magnetic field, the spectral weight is reduced above\n0.1 MHz and transferred to frequencies below 0.1 MHz so that\nthe SNS approaches the $1/f$ asymptotic in the depicted interval,\nand (ii) all spectra cross each other at about $f \\approx$ 0.1 -\n0.15 MHz. Due to the incompatibility of the experimental and\ntheoretical frequency resolution in longitudinal magnetic fields we\nprovide Fig.\\ \\ref{fig-holes} as a proof of principle only and leave\na more detailed parameter fit of the Hamiltonian \\eqref{Ham} to the\nexperimental data depicted in Fig.~\\ref{lonspec} to the next\ngeneration of high power computers.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nWe have applied spin noise spectroscopy to measure the spin\nlifetimes of QD electrons and holes in zero and finite magnetic\nfields. Both types of charge carriers demonstrate a similar change\nof the SNS shape in longitudinal magnetic field, from\nabout Lorentzian to $1/f$ dependence, as they become stabilized along the field.\nOur findings demonstrate that the spin noise in longitudinal fields\nallows for a clear separation of electron and hole spin\ncontributions in QD ensembles and, correspondingly, the\ndetermination of their spin lifetimes due to the difference of their\ninteraction strength with the nuclear spin fluctuations. Transverse\nmagnetic fields allow one to define the fractions of electron and\nhole spin subensembles within a given sample.\n\nThe experimental data have been discussed in the framework of two\ncomplementary theoretical approaches: the Chebyshev polynomial\nexpansion technique (CET) which provides a fully quantum treatment\nof the spin noise problem and the semi-classical approximation (SCA)\nwhich is based on the separation of the electron and nuclear spin\ndynamics. The applicability of these approaches is evaluated for the\ndifferent studied experimental configurations. Comparison of the\nexperimental data with the modeling shows that the CET approach is a\npowerful method to describe the spectral SNS shape in the\nintermediate and high frequency ranges. The limitations of this\nmethod are given only by the computational power that apply in our\ncase to frequencies below 0.1\\,MHz. An additional advantage of the\nCET is given by the rigorous inclusion of quadrupolar splittings of\nthe nuclei which provides a quantitative explanation of the similar\nlong-time/low-frequency spin dynamics for both types of carriers. On\nthe other hand, the SCA enables one to elaborate an intuitive and\nconsistent qualitative picture of the spin dynamics and spin\nfluctuations. This approach has its limitations at very low\nfrequencies to describe the shape of the zero-frequency peak.\nHowever, it gives a good qualitative description of the overall spin\nnoise spectra using simplified assumptions and a high quantitative\nprecision for the high frequency part of the spectra. This method\ncan serve to estimate the parameters of the hyperfine interaction\nand the $g$-factors of electrons and holes from the experimental\ndata which then can serve as input into a more advanced quantum\nmechanical approach.\n\n\\acknowledgements We acknowledge the financial support by the\nDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the Russian Foundation of Basic\nResearch through the transregio TRR 160, the RF President Grants\nMD-5726.2015.2, and SP-643.2015.5, the RF Government Grant\n14.Z50.31.0021 (Leading scientist M.

Since the experimental measurements are performed on an\nensemble of QDs, the averaging over the variations of the hyperfine\nfield parameters should be implemented as noted in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:semiclass}. To that end, we have assumed that the\nradius of the QDs, which determines the parameters $A_k^\\mu$ and the\n$g$-factors, is varying within the QD ensemble. For details\nconcerning this averaging procedure see Ref.~\\cite{jh2014-1}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Samples and setup}\\label{sec:samples}\n\nWe study $p$- and $n$-doped ensembles of self-assembled QDs. Both\nsamples have 20-layers of MBE-grown (In,Ga)As/GaAs QDs separated by\n60 nm GaAs barriers with a QD density of 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ per\nlayer. The $p$-doped sample was annealed for 30~s at 960\n$^{\\circ}$C, and the $n$-doped at 945 $^{\\circ}$C, shifting the\nemission spectra of the samples to the sensitivity range of silicon\nphotodetectors and reducing the inhomogeneity of the QD ensemble.\nAlthough the $p$-doped QDs were not intentionally doped, the sample\nhas a background level of $p$-type doping due to residual carbon\nimpurities~\\cite{sac2010}. The $n$-type sample doping was obtained\nby incorporating $\\delta$-sheets of Si-dopants 20 nm below each QD\nlayer, with the dopant density roughly equal to the QD\ndensity~\\cite{ag2006}. The samples are mounted on the cold finger of\na liquid Helium flow cryostat, and cooled down to a temperature of 5\nK.\n\nFigure \\ref{wav} shows low excitation photoluminescence (PL) spectra\n(solid curves) for the $n$-type sample, panel (a), and for the\n$p$-type sample, panel (b), demonstrating mostly emission from the\nQD ground state transitions. The PL has its maximum at 1.398 eV (887\nnm) for the $n$-type QDs, and at 1.381 eV (898 nm) for the $p$-type\nQDs.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{WavelengthDependence.eps}\n        \\caption{(a) Low excitation PL and spin noise power, i.e. area under the SNS, as functions of the probe wavelength for the $n$-doped QD sample;\n        (b) the same for the $p$-doped sample. The slight red shift of the spin noise compared to the PL for the n-doped sample\n        may result from a concentration of singly charged dots on the low energy side, while towards higher energies the dots become\n        increasingly uncharged. The blue shift in case of the p-doped sample, on the other hand, may result from a double charging of\n        the low energy dots with a pair of holes forming a spin zero singlet state. Towards the high energy side single\n        resident hole spin charging occurs in the dots, resulting in an increase of spin noise. This\n        increased p-doping level is confirmed by the increased intensity of emission from excited states compared to the n-doped sample.}\n        \\label{wav}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe linearly polarized probe light is taken from a tunable\ncontinuous wave (cw) Titanium-Sapphire ring laser emitting a single\nfrequency laser line with a linewidth of < 10\\,MHz. The laser is\nthen guided through a single mode optical fiber for spatial mode\nshaping ($\\text{TEM}_{00}$). After a Glan-Taylor polarizer providing\na linear extinction ratio of 10$^5$, the beam is transmitted through\nthe sample with a large area focus of 100~micrometers diameter, in\norder to minimize optical excitation effects in the QD\nensemble~\\cite{yl2012,sp1}.\n\nDetection of the Faraday rotation noise is done with a standard\npolarimeter, consisting of a Wollaston prism and a broadband optical\nbalanced detector. Two different detectors are used to study slower\nand faster dynamics: one has a bandwidth of 40 kHz $\\div$ 650 MHz\n(New Focus 1607-AC) requiring optical powers of typically a few\nmilliwatts (\\emph{fast} detector), while the other one (Femto HCA-S)\ncovers a bandwidth of DC $\\div$ 100 MHz, requiring powers of a few\nhundreds of microwatts (\\emph{slow} detector). The output of the\ndetectors is amplified and low-pass filtered at variable cutoff\nfrequencies to avoid undersampling, and then sent to the input of a\ndigitizer. The digitizer incorporates field programmable gate array\n(FPGA) technology for real time computation of the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) of the digitized voltage samples. The maximum\nbandwidth is limited at 1\\,GHz, providing 16384 spectral lines at a\nspectral resolution of 61.04 kHz. If necessary, the bandwidth can be\nreduced down to 200 MHz with a resolution of 12.21 kHz. For even\nhigher resolution as required, e.g., in the case of zero and\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements, spectra could be also\nacquired with a PCIe digitizer card installed in a computer, in\ncombination with multicore FFT processing and averaging. In this\nwork, the signal accumulation times varied between 1 minute and 30\nminutes, depending on the overall noise signal amplitude.\n\nFigure~\\ref{wav} shows, in addition to the PL spectra discussed\nabove, the integrated spin noise power, i.e. the area under the spin\nnoise power density spectrum (SNS), $\\int_0^\\infty d\\omega\n(\\vartheta_F^2)_\\omega$, as function of the probe wavelength for\nboth samples. The spin noise power nearly follows the PL line, with\nmaxima at 889 nm for the $n$-type sample and at 896 nm for the\n$p$-type sample. This is the typical behaviour for inhomogeneously\nbroadened ensembles~\\cite{vz2013}. Thus the laser is tuned into the\nabsorption band to provide measurable noise signal.\n\nUsing electromagnets we are able to apply magnetic fields, in the\nlongitudinal direction (Faraday geometry, along the growth direction\nof the sample) up to $B_{z,max}$ = 120 mT and in the transverse\ndirection (Voigt geometry) up to $B_{x,max}$ = 350 mT. In order to\nremove the spin-independent contribution to $(\\vartheta_F^2)_\\omega$\nfrom the overall photon shot noise and the intrinsic electronic\nnoise, the spin noise measurements were interleaved between two\nmagnetic fields: one measurement with the desired strength and\ndirection, and the other one applied in the Voigt geometry at $B_{x}\n\\geqslant$ 250 mT for shifting the precession peak out of the\ndetectable bandwidth. Subtraction of both spectra then yields the\npure spin noise contribution. In order to account for the frequency\ndependent sensitivity of the detectors, the noise power spectra were\nadditionally normalized by the photon shot noise power spectra\nmeasured without the sample, with the laser radiation shone directly\nonto the detectors.\n\n\n\\section{Results and Discussions}\\label{sec:discussion}\n\nIn this section we present the experimental data for the spin noise\nmeasurements in zero and finite transversal or longitudinal magnetic\nfields. Furthermore we provide the results of the simulations using\nthe two theoretical approaches and discuss their limitations and\nadvantages.\n\nNote that for convenient comparison with the experiment we present \ncharacteristic frequencies of the two models, such as $\\delta_e$ and $\\delta_h$, \nas well as Larmor frequencies and simulated spin noise spectra, in units of MHz, \ni.e. in units of an ordinary frequency, rather than by an angular frequency as used in the models. \n\n\\subsection{Spin noise at zero magnetic field}\\label{sec:zeroB}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics{ZeroField-expth.eps}\n\\caption{SNS measured on the (a) $n$-doped and the (b) $p$-doped QD\nsamples at zero external magnetic field using a probe power of 4~mW\n(50~W/cm$^2$) with the fast detector. The red arrow in panel (a)\nindicates the feature related with the precession of electron spins\ndue to the hyperfine coupling to the nuclei. Panels (c) and (d) show\nadditionally fits (red curve) to the experimental data with the\nsemiclassical model using the parameters $\\delta_e=70$~MHz,\n$\\tau_s^e=5$~ns, $\\delta_h=40$~MHz, $\\lambda_h=10$, $\\tau_s^h=80$~ns\n(c) and $\\tau_s^h=240$~ns~(d). The spectra are calculated using\nEqs.~\\eqref{theta:F} and \\eqref{sns:class} with $\\mathcal\nAN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h)=4$ for panel (c), and Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} for\n(d). The dash-dotted red curves in panels (e) and (f) indicate fits\nobtained with the CET. The CET results are calculated assuming\n$\\lambda_h=5$, $\\delta_{e} = $ 110 MHz and $\\delta_{h} = $ 16 MHz.\nThe electron fraction for the $n$-doped sample is set to $80\\,\\%$,\nand to $15\\,\\%$ for the $p$-doped sample. For the ensemble averaging a\nGaussian distribution of the QD radius $L_0$ with a relative\nstandard deviation $\\Delta L_0 / L_0 = 0.2$ is assumed. The ratio\n$Q_r$ is set to $0.6$ for electrons and to $6$ for holes since\n$A^e_k\\approx 10 A_k^h$. All further parameters are chosen as\ndiscussed in section~\\ref{sec:quantum}. } \\label{zf}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{zf} compares the spin noise spectra for $n$- and\n$p$-doped QDs, left and right column of panels, respectively,\nmeasured at zero external magnetic field. For these experiments we\nused the fast detector and the FPGA module to cover a broad\nfrequency range.\n\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{zf}(b), the spin noise in the $p$-doped sample\nconsists of a single peak centered around zero frequency. In the\nchosen log-log scale representation we find that the curve closely\nfollows a Lorentzian in the frequency domain (shown additionally by\nthe dash-dotted line), which corresponds to an exponential decay in\ntime~\\cite{yl2012}. The spin noise spectrum of the $n$-doped sample reveals, in\naddition to the zero-frequency peak, a pronounced ``shoulder''\n(termed in the following as precession peak or Overhauser peak) at a frequency\nof $\\sim 100$\\,MHz, as highlighted by the red arrow in\nFig.~\\ref{zf}(a). This peak is related to the magnetic field caused\nby the intrinsic nuclear fluctuations, that act on the electrons as\na constant (frozen) magnetic field pointing along a random\ndirection. The electron spin components parallel to the frozen\nnuclear field contribute to the zero-frequency peak in the signal\nwith $1/3$ of the full spin polarization. The other $2/3$ precess\naround the nuclear field and are thus seen as the precession\npeak~\\cite{glazov:review}. The absence of such a shoulder in the\nhole spin ensemble signal is a direct indication of the anisotropic\nnature of the hole-nuclear interaction~\\cite{mg2012}.\n\nThe relative amplitude of the precession peak and the zero-frequency peak is\ninfluenced by several factors: (i) finite correlation time of the\nelectron in a quantum dot which might be caused, i.e., by the\nprobe-assisted transfer of the electrons into other QDs, providing a\nredistribution of the spin noise power of the precession\npeak towards the zero-frequency peak~\\cite{Glazov_hopping}, or (ii)\npresence of positively charged QDs in the nominally $n$-doped\nsample, which would increase the relative weight of the zero-frequency peak. In particular, the latter can be\ntested by applying a transverse magnetic field, as will be shown in\nthe Sec.~\\ref{sec:trans:B}. It should be foreclosed at this point, that\nby applying this method we were able to evidence a percentage of about 20 $\\%$ of such non-intentionally $p$-doped QDs,\nwhich is mostly due to impurities in the MBE machine.\nHowever, this value slightly varies with the point at which the sample is probed\nby the laser. Thus, to reproduce the data in the\nsemiclassical model, we assume that the\nratio of electron and hole contributions to the measured SNS is\n$\\mathcal AN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h)=4$, see Eq.~\\eqref{theta:F}. The\ncorresponding fit results for the $n$-doped sample are presented in\nFig.~\\ref{zf}(c), from which we can determine $\\delta_e\\approx\n70$~MHz and $\\tau_s^e=5$~ns, which is consistent with estimations\nbased on the hyperfine coupling constants,\nEq.~\\ref{eq:def-delta-mu}. For the hole fraction in the same sample\nbest agreement was achieved with $\\delta_h=40$~MHz, $\\lambda_h=10$ and\n$\\tau_s^h=80$~ns.\n\nThe best agreement with the experimental data using the\nsemiclassical model for the $p$-doped sample, see the red curve in\nFig.~\\ref{zf}(d), is obtained by using the parameters\n$\\delta_h=40$~MHz and $\\lambda_h=10$ in Eq.~\\eqref{OmegaN}, as well\nas $\\tau_s^h=240$~ns in Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} (note\nthat the curve is practically insensitive to a particular value of\n$\\delta_h$ provided that $\\delta_h/\\lambda_h < 5$~MHz)  \n\nThe panels (e) and (f) of Fig.~\\ref{zf} show a direct comparison\nbetween the experimental data and the numerical results obtained via\nthe CET approach. The spin noise function obtained via the CET is\nhighly sensitive to the choice of the model parameters introduced in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:quantum}. For electron spins, panel (e), the agreement\nbetween theory and experiment in the numerically accessible regime\nis excellent. The pronounced deviation at small frequencies stems\nfrom the finite frequency resolution of the CET above\n$0.79\\,\\text{MHz}$ for the parameters used here.\n\nThe agreement between theory and experiment is less striking for the\nhole doped sample, where the theoretically determined gradient of\nthe spin noise function in the intermediate frequency regime\n$0.79\\,\\text{MHz} < \\nu < 6\\,\\text{MHz}$ does not reproduce the\nexperiment exactly. We attribute that discrepancy to the small\namount of nuclei in the CET simulations limiting the low frequency\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian~\\eqref{Ham}. The obtained agreement\nbetween experiment and theory is still remarkably good within the\nfinite size limitations of the CET and \nstates the validity of the\napplied model. \nAll important parameters obtained from describing the\nexperimental data using the two models are summarized in\nTable~\\ref{tab:1}. \n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\vspace{-0.3cm} \\caption{SCA and CET parameters determined from the\nzero magnetic field data which are consistently used also\nsubsequently in describing the data in magnetic field.}\\label{tab:1}\n\\begin{ruledtabular}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n& SCA & CET \\\\\n\\hline\n$\\delta_e$\\,(MHz) & 70 & 110 \\\\\n$\\delta_h$\\,(MHz) & 40 & 16 \\\\\n$\\lambda_h$ & 10 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{ruledtabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Long-time spin dephasing at zero field}\\label{sec:zeroB:long}\n\nAs a nearly non-perturbative method of measurement, spin noise\nshould be able to unveil the intrinsic spin lifetimes in the studied\nsystems. However, the inhomogeneously broadened QD ensembles require\nthe probe energy to be within the PL-emission band. Therefore, one\nhas to pay special attention to the applied laser power and use the\nlimit of lowest possible laser intensities to minimize excitation\neffects. As could be shown by Yan Li \\textit{et al.} for hole spins\nin a very similar sample, for the used large 100\\,$\\mu$m laser spot\nand used probe powers in the range of 0.1\\,mW, the QD spin noise\nshows only a weakly increasing linewidth of the zero-frequency\npeak with increasing probe power~\\cite{yl2012,sp1}. This shows, that\nprobe induced effects are still present, but are minimized. A linear\nfit of the linewidth power dependence should thus allow us to obtain\na rather accurate value of the intrinsic spin relaxation time by\nextrapolating the fit to zero probe power. This method was recently\nproven to give reliable results for the electron spin relaxation times\nin pump-probe studies~\\cite{prb2015_on_T1}.\n\nIn our experiments, the zero-frequency peak in the spin noise of the\n$n$- and $p$-doped sample is measured using the slow 100\\,MHz\ndetector. Its output is filtered for the frequency band from 0.01 MHz\nto 32\\,MHz and then sent through a high frequency amplifier. The\nprobe laser powers range from 0.1\\,mW to 0.6\\,mW. Since especially\nthe lineshape of the SNS from the $n$-doped QDs deviates from\nLorentzian (see above), we use a general definition of the\nlinewidth, namely the geometrical half width at half maximum (HWHM)\nof the zero-frequency peak spectrum, denoted as $\\Gamma$, see also\nRef.~\\cite{yl2012}.\n\nThe effective linewidths extracted from our experimental data are\ndepicted in Fig.~\\ref{ltd}. We observe a weak increase of the\nlinewidths with laser power in both samples. However, the changes\nare much larger for the $n$-doped QDs. This partly originates from\nthe much smaller spectral amplitudes of the zero-frequency peak as\ncompared to the $p$-doped QDs, for which the complete spin noise\npower is concentrated in the zero-frequency peak.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{HWHM-zeropeak.eps}\n        \\caption{Dependence of the HWHM of the zero-frequency spin noise peak on probe laser power. The data exhibit a weak\n        linear increase with power in both cases, whereupon for the $n$-doped sample the increase is a factor 2.5 stronger.\n        The larger error is caused by a much smaller spectral amplitude compared to that of the $p$-doped sample.\n        We determine the effective intrinsic spin lifetime in both samples by using the point of intersection of the linear fits\n        with the vertical axis at zero laser power.}\n        \\label{ltd}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFrom linear fits to the power dependences we obtain the following\nintrinsic linewidths: the $p$-doped sample obeys $\\Gamma =\n(0.35\\pm0.01)$\\,MHz, whereas $\\Gamma = (0.39\\pm0.03)$\\,MHz for the\n$n$-doped sample. The linear increase of the linewidth is steeper\nfor the n-doped dots: it grows by $40 \\%$ as the probe power is\nincreased from 0.1\\,mW to 0.6\\,mW. For hole spins we observe an\nincrease of only $10 \\%$ within the same range of laser power. This\ndifference shall be studied in greater detail in future, here we\npoint out only some related aspects. First, as has been already\nmentioned above, there is a finite fraction of $p$-doped QDs in the\nintentionally $n$-doped sample, which amounts to about 20 \\%.\nSince at zero external field $2/3$ of the electron spin noise is\nconcentrated in the precession peak and only $1/3$\ncontributes to the zero-frequency peak, holes then may contribute up\nto 40 \\% to the spin noise of the zero-frequency peak, while the\nremaining 60 \\% stems from electrons. Thus, there is a significant\nhole contribution that may influence spectral shape and amplitude of\nthe low-frequency SNS from the $n$-doped sample. Second, both\nsamples are measured under exactly the same probing conditions,\nespecially with the same large laser spot of 100\\,$\\mu$m that\nevidently produces only a weak perturbation of the spin system. We\nprove this assumption by additionally looking at the FR noise\namplitude, which is the square root of the FR noise power, obtained\nby integration of the SNS from 0.012\\,MHz to 32\\,MHz. Taking the\ndependence of the FR noise amplitude on the probe laser power, we\nobtain an exponent of $\\approx 0.85$ for both samples by fitting the\ndependence with a power law. This value is quite close to unity,\nsuggesting that the measurements were carried out close to thermal\nequilibrium, i.e., close to the non-perturbative regime~\\cite{sp1}.\nAs an example of the opposite case, Ref.~\\cite{rd2012} showes\nsignatures of strong optical perturbation, demonstrating the hole\nspin noise in a QD microcavity with the measurements carried out\nusing $10^3 \\div 10^4$ times larger probe intensity than in our\ncase. The linewidth then is increased by a factor of 3, i.e. by 200 \\%\nunder a threefold increase of laser power. This additionally\ncorroborates that our measurements are performed largely\nnon-perturbatively.\n\nUsing the well-known relation $\\tau_s = (2\\pi \\Gamma)^{-1}$ we\nderive the effective spin lifetimes. We obtain $\\tau_s^p$ =\n0.46~$\\mu$s for the $p$-doped sample, and $\\tau_s^n$ = 0.41~$\\mu$s\nfor the $n$-doped sample. These values are close to the known result of\n$\\tau_s^h$ = 0.4~$\\mu$s that was obtained in the\nRefs.~\\cite{yl2012,sp1}. At first glance it is quite surprising that\nelectrons and holes have similar relaxation times, as they show a\nstrong difference in the nuclear interaction strength. Otherwise, similar\nvalues for the spin decoherence time $T_2$ of QD electron and hole\nspins in magnetic field were revealed by the mode-locking technique\napplied to similar $n$- and $p$-doped\nheterostructures~\\cite{prb87Varwig}. As we will explain in the following,\nour observation of comparable timescales is related to the presence of additional quadrupolar interactions\nof the nuclei with electric field gradients in the dots, Eq.~\\eqref{hqc}.\n\nWithout ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$, the characteristic time scale\nfor the electron spin noise is given by $T^*_e \\propto 1/\\delta_e$,\nand the one for hole spins by $T^*_h \\propto  \\lambda_h /\\delta_h$\ndetermined by the fluctuations of the Overhauser field\n\\eqref{eq:def-delta-mu}. While $T^*_e\\approx 1-2$ ns is found in the\ntypical QD ensembles as investigated here, the $p$-wave nature of\nthe hole-wave function reduces the hyperfine couplings $A_k^h$ by a\nfactor of 10 compared to the electron spins\n\\cite{Fermi1930,Fischer2008,testelin}.  The decay of $S_{h,z}$ is\nadditionally suppressed by the anisotropy parameter $\\lambda_h\\approx\n10$, accounting for the anisotropic dipole-dipole coupling of hole\nspins to the nuclear spins \\cite{Fermi1930,Fischer2008,testelin}, so\nthat $T^*_h\\approx 100 T^*_e$.  \n\nIncluding a realistic modeling \\cite{bulutay} of the\ncoupling between the nuclei's quadrupole moments and the electric\nfield gradients (EFGs) in the QDs via  ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ is\nsufficient to explain the observed mismatch between the experiments\nand the prediction of the CSM, see also Ref.~\\cite{jh2015}.  This\ncan be intuitively understood: adding an additional source of\ndecoherence (i.e.~the quadrupole interaction) to the CSM Hamiltonian\nresults in a decrease of the coherence time of the considered\nelectron/hole spins.\n\nWithout ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$, the total spin component in $z$-direction,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat J_z^{\\rm tot} &=& \\hat S_{\\mu,z} + \\sum_k \\hat I_z^{(k)}\n,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nis a conserved operator in the CSM provided that $\\bm{\\Omega}_B^{{\\mu}} = 0$ or $\\bm{\\Omega}_B^{{\\mu}} \\parallel z$,\nimplying that each individual nucleus maintains its state until the next spin-flip process occurs,\nalways involving a combined carrier and nuclear spin flip.\n\nAdding ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ breaks this conservation law for $\\hat\nJ_z^{\\rm tot}$ in the CSM by allowing spin-flips in the nuclear spin\nbath without involving the electronic spin, and defines an additional\nlong-time scale set by the coupling strength ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$. Its\neffect onto the spin-noise function can be investigated in fourth\norder perturbation theory \\cite{HackmannPhD2015} for fixed nuclear\neasy-axis vectors $\\vec{n}^{(k)}_z=\\vec{e}_z$: a term linear in\n$q_k$ and cubic in $A_k^\\mu$ accelerates the decay of $S_{\\mu,z}$\nbut a $q_k^2$ term decelerates the spin decay.  We note that the\ninfluence of ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ onto the decay of the electronic\nspin is indirect and only occurs in combination with the hyperfine\ninteraction. Its effect is non-universal and cannot be casted into a\nsimple decay time or energy scale as defined by the fluctuation of\nthe Overhauser field \\eqref{eq:def-delta-mu}.  The reason is related\nto its two opposite limits. For $A_k> q_k$, typically relevant for\nthe experiment, ${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ provides additional nuclear\nspin-flip processes leading to an additional spin decay at long time\nscales set by $Q_r$, Eq.~\\eqref{Qr}, as outlined above. For the opposite limit,\n$A_k\\ll q_k$, the nuclear system must be diagonalized first,\nproviding a set of two time-reversal doublets as the new eigenbasis\nfor each nuclear spin energetically separated by $2q_k\\sqrt{1+\\eta^2\n4/3}$. Then the coupling to the electron/hole spin is treated\nperturbatively, and the rigidity of the nuclear system can suppress\nadditional dephasing for $\\eta\\to 0$ \\cite{HackmannPhD2015,Wu2015}.\n\nSince the $\\vec{n}^{(k)}_z$ have different strain induced\norientations at each nuclei in a real QD, their angular distribution\n\\cite{bulutay} and the in-plane anisotropy $\\eta$, however, provide\nan additional source of randomness and, hence, spin dephasing even\nfor stronger hyperfine coupling due to the misalignment of the local\nnuclear easy-axis and the growth orientation, defining the global\n$z$-axis. \n\nCrucial for the understanding of the comparable long-time\nspin decay of electron spins and hole spins is the fact that ${\\cal\nH}_{N}^\\mu$ is caused by the growth induced strain in the QDs, and\nits energy scale is consequently independent of the QD doping.  This\nadditional source of decoherence counteracts the lifetime\nenhancement of a factor $10\\lambda_h$ as predicted within the CSM\nfor hole spins. The quantum mechanical CET predicts \\cite{jh2015}\nthat the long-term lifetime is of the same order of magnitude for\n$n$-type and $p$-type QDs grown under identical growth conditions,\nas demonstrated in Fig.\\ \\ref{zf}(e) and (f).\n\nAt values $Q_r\\approx 6$ as used in Fig.\\ \\ref{zf}(f), the nuclear\nquadrupole electric couplings become the limiting factor of the\ncoherence time in zero magnetic field.\n\nOn a semiclassical level, the influence of the additional\nquadrupolar couplings can be understood \nby investigating the equation of motion\nof a single nuclear spin in the Hamiltonian \\eqref{Ham} coupled to a fictitious static carrier spin.\nWithin the CSM only,  the nuclear spin would precess around this central spin \nwith a Larmor  frequency proportional to \nthe individual $A_k^\\mu$. This leads to slow dynamics of the Overhauser field \\cite{merkulov02}\nand a long-time carrier  spin decay described by a power law \\cite{CoishLoss2004,jh2014-1} with some logarithmic\ncorrections governing the low frequency part of the spin-noise spectra. Adding the quadrupolar couplings\n${\\cal H}_{N}^\\mu$ has two effects on the nuclear spin dynamics: firstly it enhances the\nnuclear Larmor frequency, and, secondly, the breaking of the total spin conservation law\ntranslates into a change of an effective precession axis which is not longer\ndetermined by the carrier spin direction only. Both effects yields to an addition dephasing of the \nOverhauser field and consequently to a dephasing of the non-decaying \nfraction of the spin-correlation function \\cite{uhrig2014} on a time scale dominated by the quadrupolar\ncoupling strength.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Spin noise in transverse magnetic fields}\\label{sec:trans:B}\n\nA magnetic field applied perpendicular to the probe beam propagation\ndirection, $\\bm B \\parallel x$ (Voigt geometry), induces spin\nprecession and shifts the corresponding noise peak along the\nfrequency axis to the Larmor frequency $\\Omega_B^\\mu$. We have\ncarried out measurements for electron and hole spins up to field\nstrengths of $B_x = 80$~mT, using the fast 650\\,MHz photodetector\nwith a probe power of 4\\,mW. The experimental results are presented\nin Fig.~\\ref{elpr} panel (a) for the $p$-type sample and panel (b)\nfor the $n$-type sample.\n\nWe start the analysis with the data on the $p$-type sample, shown in\npanel (a). At $B_x\\ne 0$ the SNS consists of two peaks: the first\none remains centered at $\\omega=0$, but its amplitude decreases with\nincreasing magnetic field, and the second one appears at $\\omega \\ne\n0$, shifting with the field towards higher frequencies, in agreement\nwith our expectations, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:semiclass}, because the\ntransverse magnetic field suppresses the role of the nuclear field\nfluctuations, therefore reducing the zero-peak contribution. The\nexperimental data are adequately described by the semiclassical\nmodel, Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class}, using the following values of fit\nparameters: transverse hole $g$-factor $g_h^\\perp=0.16$, measured\nfrom the linear shift of the second peak maximum with magnetic\nfield, $g$-factor spread of $\\approx 37$~\\%, measured from the\nbroadening of the peak, and $\\tau_s^h\\approx 16$~ns for $B_x\\geqslant\n20$~mT, see the solid curves in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a) for results. To achieve\nbetter agreement between experiment and theory at $B_x=0$ the curve \ncentered at zero frequency is calculated with a longer spin relaxation\n$\\tau_s^{h,0}\\approx 240$~ns. This extension of the spin relaxation\ntime by the magnetic field is beyond the scope of the semiclassical\nmodel and demonstrates its limitations.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n    \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{TransverseField.eps}\n        \\caption{(a) SNS measured on the $p$-doped QD sample in the transverse magnetic fields indicated in the legend.\n\t\t\t\tThe acronym \"PSN\" means \"photon shot noise\".\n        Fits with the semiclassical model are shown by the solid lines at $B_x$ = 40\\,mT and 80\\,mT. The heavy hole\n        $g$-factor is $g_h^\\perp=0.16$ with a spread of 37\\%.

All other CET parameters except the hole $g$-factor\n        spread are the same as in Fig.\\ \\ref{zf}.}\n        \\label{elpr}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nTo illustrate further the validity of the semiclassical model at\nnon-zero fields and to analyze the interplay of the nuclear spin\nfluctuations and the external magnetic field in more detail, we plot\nthe ratio of the area under the zero-frequency SNS peak to the area\nunder the whole SNS for an extended range of field strengths up to\n$B_x$ = 120 mT, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:Zero}. The area of the zero-frequency peak was extracted by fitting the SNS by a linear\ncombination of a Gaussian function centered at $\\omega\\ne 0$ and two\nLorentzians centered at $\\omega=0$ with different widths. The\nGaussian function is needed to account for the non-zero frequency\nspin precession peak and the two Lorentzians reflecting exponential\ndecays in time are needed to reproduce rather accurately the shape\nof the zero-frequency component whose precise calculation is beyond\nthe scope of the semiclassical model. The Gaussian is characteristic\nfor a behavior determined by an inhomogeneous distribution such as\nthe $g$-factor variations \\cite{mg2012}. Figure~\\ref{fig:Zero} demonstrates good\nagreement between theory and experiment.\n\nNext we turn to the SNS of the $n$-type QD sample in transverse\nmagnetic field, shown in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(b). Here, at $B_x\\ne 0$ one\ncan see two features in the SNS appearing at non-zero frequencies.\nOne of them correlates with the hole Larmor precession,\nFig.~\\ref{elpr}(a), while the other one has much higher frequency\nand can be attributed to the electrons. As mentioned above, the ratio of the areas under\nthese two peaks is slightly sensitive to the particular point of the sample that is probed by the laser.\n \nThis observation supports our conjecture\nthat $n$- and $p$-doped quantum dots coexist in the nominally\n$n$-type sample, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:zeroB}. Hence, as in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:zeroB}, to describe the experimental data within the\nsemiclassical model we take into account contributions of electron\nand hole spins to the measured SNS. The particular data in\nFig.~\\ref{elpr}(b) are well described by Eqs.~\\eqref{theta:F} and\n\\eqref{sns:class}, see solid curves in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(b),\ncalculated using a fraction of positively charged QDs, $\\mathcal\nAN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h)\\approx 4$.\nOther fit parameters are chosen as follows: $g_e^\\perp = 0.55$, its\nspread is about $7$~\\%, and $\\tau_s^e=5$~ns, taken independent on\n$B_x$. We note that such a short value of $\\tau_s^e$ is introduced\ninto the semiclassical model to approximate the relatively broad\nzero-frequency contribution in the SNS. An analysis of the\n``intrinsic'' electron spin relaxation time is presented below in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:longB}.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{elpr} we demonstrate the agreement between the\nexperimental results and the CET for transversal external fields.\nThe CET parameters are set to those of the zero-field calculation\nused in Fig.~\\ref{zf}. The comparison between the experimental\nresults and the CET data (dashed lines) for $B = 60\\,\\text{mT}$ \nserves as a proof of principle assuring comparable results for the\nremainder experimental data. For the $p$-type samples, the\nelectron-spin contribution to the spectrum is negligible, and the\nCET reproduces the obtained hole-spin spectrum at all frequency\nranges in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a).\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{ZeroPeak.eps}\n        \\caption{Analysis of the relative spectral area of the zero-frequency peak as a function of transverse magnetic field\n        calculated for the $p$-doped sample using the semiclassical approach.

The solid curve is calculated using Eq.~\\eqref{sns:class} with the same\n        set of parameters as Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a).}\n        \\label{fig:Zero}\n    \\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs noted above, the SNS of $n$-type samples shows a shallow\nlow-frequency feature tracing perfectly the spin-noise peak of the\n$p$-type samples with increasing magnetic field. Due to the $\\sim\n20\\,\\%$ admixture of holes to the $n$-doped spectrum, the hole SNS\nprovides an additional finite low-frequency contribution around the\nhole Larmor frequency that is accurately reproduced by the CET\napproach as shown in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(b). As previously\ndemonstrated~\\cite{mg2012,jh2014-1}, the width of the spin\nprecession peak is mainly governed by the parameter $\\delta_\\mu$ at\nsmall and moderate fields, while at higher fields it is controlled\nadditionally by the $g$-factor spread; the peak shape is\napproximately Gaussian for $\\Omega_B \\gg \\delta_\\mu$.\n\nThe transversal magnetic field reduces the non-decaying fraction of\nthe spin-correlation function responsible for the zero-frequency\n$\\delta$-peak in the spin-noise spectrum. Consequently spectral\nweight is transferred to finite frequencies to fulfil the spectral\nsum rule~\\cite{mg2012,jh2014-1,oest:nsn}, which describes the\nconservation of a total number of fluctuating spins. This is clearly\nvisible in the $p$-type spectra shown in Fig.~\\ref{elpr}(a). Such a\nsuppression is also found in $n$-type samples. \n\nSynopsis of the transverse-field results shows that the data in\nFigs.~\\ref{elpr} and \\ref{fig:Zero} can be well described by both\nmodels, the semiclassical and the quantum-mechanical one.\n\n\n\\subsection{Spin noise in longitudinal magnetic fields}\\label{sec:longB}\n\nUnder application of a magnetic field along the light propagation\naxis the role of transverse fluctuations of the Overhauser field\ndiminishes. This leads to: (i) suppression of the precession peak, and (ii) modification of the\nzero-frequency peak amplitude and shape. As noted above, the total\narea under the noise spectrum remains constant and does not depend\non magnetic field due to conservation of the number of spins in the\nprobed volume. \n\nIn this section we focus on the zero-frequency peak.\nThis allows/requires (i)\nusage of the highly sensitive slow detector with low probe laser\npowers to minimize optical excitation effects and (ii) detailed\nmonitoring of zero-frequency peak modifications because of higher\nspectral resolution. In particular, we filtered the detector output\nvoltage for the frequency band between 0.009 MHz\nand 17.5 MHz.\n\nThe suppression of the precession peak in the\n$n$-doped sample then becomes indirectly observable by changes of\nthe integral spectral area of the zero-frequency peak, as for higher\nlongitudinal fields the spins become stabilized and redistributed in\nfrequency into the zero-peak component.\n\nFigure~\\ref{lonspec} shows the low-frequency SNS of the $n$-type\nsample, panel (a), and of the $p$-type sample, panel (b), measured\nat 0.2 mW probe laser power for different values of the longitudinal\nmagnetic field. It was our aim to measure both samples under\ncomparable probing conditions with the lowest possible laser power.\nThe chosen low probe laser power is dictated by the small noise\namplitude in the selected frequency range for the $n$-doped sample\nat zero external field, because the nuclear field distributes 2/3 of\nthe total spectral weight of the electron spin noise into the\nOverhauser precession peak (not shown).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{LongFieldSpectra-exp.eps}\n        \\caption{SNS measured on the (a) $n$-doped and (b) $p$-doped QD ensemble at different longitudinal magnetic fields\n        using a probe laser power of 0.2 mW, see legend for the field strengths. The black dashed lines illustrate the $1/f$-asymptotics.}\n        \\label{lonspec}\n\\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe experimental data clearly demonstrate the enhancement of the\nzero-frequency peak with increasing magnetic field. The spectra of\nboth samples transform towards a $1/f$ behaviour of the SNS at\nsufficiently high field strengths, as reported previously for a\n$p$-doped sample~\\cite{yl2012}. This indicates a crossover to a\n$1/\\ln{t}$ spin decay in time, which is especially noteworthy for\nthe $n$-doped sample, since the longitudinal field redistributes\nelectron spin fluctuations from the Overhauser precession peak into\nthe zero-frequency peak (see below), such that at the maximum\napplied field strength the electron spin contribution to the zero-frequency peak clearly dominates, despite the finite admixture from\n$p$-doped QDs. Thus, the crossover to $1/f$-noise can be termed a\ngeneral property of carrier spins in QDs, regardless of the type of\nresident carrier charge.\n\nTo obtain deeper insight into the complex dynamics of interacting\nelectron and nuclear spins we extract again the effective spin\nrelaxation times $\\tau_s$ from the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM)\nof the zero-frequency SNS component, see Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(a).\nSince the shape of the zero-frequency feature strongly deviates from\na Lorentzian, especially for sufficiently high magnetic fields where\n$1/f$ behavior dominates, such procedure only gives effective\ntimescales for the spin relaxation, as explained above in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:zeroB:long}.\n\nThe red dimonds in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(a) show the effective\nrelaxation times $\\tau_s^p$ for the $p$-doped QD sample. It abruptly\nincreases with increasing magnetic field up to $\\sim 10$\\,mT, from\n$\\sim 0.4$ $\\mu$s (consistent with the measurements shown in\nSecs.~\\ref{sec:zeroB}, \\ref{sec:trans:B}) to 5.3\\,$\\mu$s. The\nlongitudinal field overwhelms the anisotropic nonzero hyperfine\nfield experienced by the hole through the hole-nuclear coupling, and\nthus suppresses the hole spin dephasing due to hyperfine\ninteraction. For the magnetic field range from 20 mT to 120 mT,\n$\\tau_s^p$ slowly increases further up to about $6.5$~$\\mu$s,\nshowing signatures of saturation at the highest field strengths. We\nascribe this behaviour to a small fraction of non-intentionally\n$n$-doped QDs in this sample. Notably, the width of the dip in the\nmagnetic field dependence of the electron spin lifetime around zero\nfield should be considerably larger than that for holes. This is\nbecause the hyperfine field acting on the electron spin is stronger.\nHence, a larger external magnetic field is needed to overcome the\nhyperfine field. This assumption is supported by the spin lifetime\nbehaviour $\\tau_s^n(B_z)$ observed for the $n$-doped sample, see\nblack dots in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(a). The broad component is\nsignificantly more pronounced than in the $p$-doped sample. The\nnarrow dip for fields $|B_z| \\lesssim 10$~mT is ascribed to the\npresence of $p$-doped QDs in the $n$-type sample. The broad,\nelectron-induced component demonstrates a further increase in the\neffective electron spin lifetime to 5.6 $\\mu$s, showing also\npronounced signatures of saturation at $|B_z| = 120$\\,mT.\n\nAdditionally, with increasing magnetic field strength, the 2/3 of\ntotal spectral weight of electron spin noise contained at zero\nexternal field in the precession peak become continuously\nredistributed into the zero-frequency peak. In order to demonstrate this behaviour, we\nmade use of two facts: (i) a simple measure for the spectral weight of\nthe spin noise is provided by the area under the SNS, which in turn can be obtained\nfrom an integration, $\\int_{\\omega_1}^{\\omega_2}d\\omega\\left(\\vartheta_F^2\\right)_{\\omega}$;\n(ii) for the analysis of the redistribution, it is sufficient to monitor the increase of the spectral area\nunder the zero-frequency peak. Thus, we performed the integration of the SNS in the frequency range depcited in Fig.~\\ref{lonspec}, i.e. from 0.009 MHz\nto 10 MHz. \n\nFor our $n$-doped sample we finally obtain a dependence of the zero-frequency peak area on $B_z$ as depicted \nby the black dots in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b). The continuous redistribution of the spectral weight of the electron spin noise is clearly seen, whereupon\nsaturation occurs for $|B_z| \\geqslant$ 80 mT. In principle, the observed behaviour can be explained with the total\nlongitudinal field overcoming the transverse components of the\nnuclear hyperfine field that is isotropic in the n-doped QD ensemble, such that\nfinally an anisotropic total magnetic field acts on these QDs,\nshuffling all spectral weight of the electron spin noise into the\nzero-frequency peak, as is the case for hole spins~\\cite{mg2012}.\nHowever, the total increase of the zero-frequency peak area in\nthe $n$-doped sample amounts to a factor of $\\sim$2.3 only, instead\nof the expected factor of $3$~\\cite{mg2012}. This is in line\nwith the presence of $p$-doped QDs, and the spectral cutoff at the\nsmallest frequencies ($f < 0.009$ MHz).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{LongField-LifetimeArea.eps}\n        \\caption{Dependence of (a) the effective spin lifetime inferred from the HWHM of the zero-frequency peak SNS, and\n        (b) the area under the zero-frequency peak SNS    \n        of both QD samples on longitudinal field strength.\n        Each sample shows some characteristic features of a fraction of QDs in each ensemble being doped non-intentionally\n        with the other type of carrier spin, respectively. This is due to impurities incorporated during the growth process.}\n        \\label{arealifetime}\n\\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo complete the discussion of the experimental observations, we\naddress the dependence of the spin noise amplitude of the $p$-doped\nsample on the longitudinal field strength, see the red diamonds in\nFig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b). The absence of any pronounced dependence\non $B_z$ indicates that the amount of $n$-type quantum dots in this\nsample is rather small. Indeed, for $\\lesssim 10$~\\% of $n$-type\ndots their contribution to the zero-frequency peak amplitude can\nhardly be resolved within our experimental accuracy.\n\nSummarizing the experimental findings, we note that in sufficiently\nstrong magnetic fields (which suppress the frozen nuclear fields)\nboth types of carrier spins (i) demonstrate quite similar effective\nspin lifetimes, and (ii) show a trend towards a $1/\\ln{(t)}$ spin\ndecay manifesting itself as a $1/f$ behavior of the zero-frequency\npeak SNS.\n\nThe semiclassical model outlined in Sec.~\\ref{sec:semiclass}\nprovides an increase of $\\tau_s^h$ with increasing longitudinal\nmagnetic field if a finite value of the correlation time $\\tau_c$ is\ntaken into account. However, our estimations show that such an\nincrease should be observed at larger fields than observed, $B_z\n\\sim 20$~mT for the parameters extracted from the fits in\nSec.~\\ref{sec:trans:B}. Hence, such an abrupt increase as well as\nthe weak increase of the hole spin relaxation time at\n$\\Omega_B^\\mu>\\delta_\\mu$ should be analyzed in terms of the\ninterconnected hole and nuclear spin dynamics~\\cite{yl2012},\nquadrupolar splittings~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad} and, possibly, taking\ninto account other spin relaxation mechanisms unrelated to the\nhyperfine interaction~\\cite{Khaetskii1}. On the other hand, the\nsemiclassical model provides a reasonable description of the\nredistribution of the spectral weight of electron spin noise into the zero-frequency\npeak under longitudinal magnetic fields: taking the value of $\\delta_e=70$~MHz\nfrom the fitting of the zero-field SNS, Fig.~\\ref{zf}(c), as well as \n20 \\% of $p$-doped QDs, $AN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h) = 4$, we obtain\nthe red solid curve in Fig.~\\ref{lonfit} without any additional\nfitting parameters, giving fair accord with the measured data. Note,\nthat the value of the electron spin lifetime $\\tau_s^e$ only weakly\naffects the dependence of the zero-frequency peak area on the\nlongitudinal magnetic field.\n\n\nWithin the CSM, the suppression of the electron spin decoherence in\na longitudinal field $\\bm{B} \\parallel z$ with field strength\n$B_z = |\\bm{B}|$ leads to a rapid increase of the long-time\nlimit $S_\\infty(b) = \\lim_{\\tau\\to\\infty} S_e(\\tau)$ of the spin\ncorrelation function $S_e(\\tau)$ defined in Eq.~\\eqref{Heisenberg}.\n$S_\\infty(b)$ is proportional to the spectral weight of the\nzero-frequency peak contribution, and its dependency on the dimensionless magnetic\nfield $b = \\Omega_B^eT_e^*$, with $\\Omega_B^e$\ndenoting the frequency of the Larmor precession induced by the longitudinal field ($\\bm{\\Omega}_B^e \\parallel z$), is given by the interpolation formula\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\tS_\\infty(b) &=& S_e(0) - \\frac{S_e(0)-S_\\infty(b=0)}{1+b^2}\n\\label{eq:s-infty}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nfor the $n$-type QDs~\\cite{HackmannPhD2015}, with $S_e(0)=1/4$ being the\ninitial value of the spin-correlation function \\eqref{spectrum0} at\ntime $t=0$, and $T_e^*\\propto 1/\\delta_e$ denoting the characteristic\ntimescale of the electron spin fluctuations (see above). Note, that Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty}\nholds in the SCA as well with an accuracy higher than $4~\\%$.\n\nWithin the quantum  mechanical approach~\\cite{jh2014-1} to the CSM\nit was found that (i) the spectral weight of the spin precession\npeak rapidly decays as $\\propto b^2$~\\cite{HackmannPhD2015}, (ii) the\nlow-frequency spectral weight ($1/\\tau_s^e \\ll \\omega \\ll \\delta_e$)\nis strongly reduced as well as (iii) collapsing into the\nzero-frequency peak~\\cite{jh2014-1,HackmannPhD2015} leading to Eq.\\\n\\eqref{eq:s-infty} for longitudinal magnetic fields. \n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics{LonAreaNdoped-fit.eps}\n        \\caption{The red line shows a fit to the data shown in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b) using the semiclassical approach\n        with $\\delta_e = 70$\\,MHz and $AN_e/(\\mathcal BN_h) = 4$ as obtained from the zero-field and transverse-field SNS.\n        The blue line shows $S_\\infty(b)$ obtained from Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty}, under particular consideration of Eq.~\\eqref{b-alternative}, and with\n\t\t\t\tparameters $\\delta_e$ = 110 MHz and $S_e(0)/S_{\\infty}(b=0)$ = 2.14 consistent with the CET calculations added to Fig.~\\ref{zf}, as well as\n\t\t\t\t$S_e(0)$ = 0.08.}\n        \\label{lonfit}\n\\end{centering}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe SNS shown in Fig.~\\ref{lonspec} suggests that the high energy\nparts of the spectrum are not solemnly transferred to the\nzero-frequency $\\delta$-peak as predicted by the CSM, but are\ndistributed over some finite low-frequency range obeying $1/f$\nbehaviour as shown in Fig.~\\ref{lonspec}. This experimental\nobservation supports the claim that a simple CSM is insufficient to\nexplain the observed SNS, and additional terms in the Hamiltonian\nare needed for the proper description of low-frequency parts of the\nSNS.\n\nAs mentioned, the $n$-type and $p$-type QDs show similar\nlow-frequency features in the SNS spectrum, leading to the estimated\nlong-time scales in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(a) that are quite\ncomparable for both spin species and only weakly field dependent\nonce $\\Omega_B^eT_e^*\\gg 1$. Therefore, the mechanism governing the\nlow-frequency part of the spectrum must be the same for both types\nof QDs and nearly independent of the longitudinal magnetic field.\nThis serves as a piece of evidence that the nuclear quadrupolar\ncouplings, Eq.~\\eqref{hqc} and Refs.~\\cite{sinitsyn:quad,jh2015}\nprovide this mechanism: The quadrupolar splittings defined by the\nHamiltonian ${\\cal H}_{N}^{\\mu}$ are induced during the growth\nprocess~\\cite{bulutay} and are independent of doping. Moreover,\nsince the nuclear magnetic moment is about 2000 times smaller than\nthe Bohr magneton, the nuclear system remains almost unaffected by\nthe comparably weak longitudinal magnetic fields applied in our\nexperiments.\n\nReplacing the non-decaying fraction of the spin-correlation\nfunction~\\cite{uhrig2014} by the integral over the low-frequency\npart of the spectrum yields the same functional dependence of this\nsignal area on the longitudinal magnetic field as in Eq.\\\n\\eqref{eq:s-infty} for $n$-type QDs. In fact, identifying\n$S_\\infty(b)$ with the zero-frequency peak area in the SNS and\nsetting $S_\\infty(b=0)=S(0)/3$ using the SCA estimate\n~\\cite{merkulov02} precisely describes the increase of the zero-frequency peak \narea as function of the magnetic field, where $S_e(0)$ takes the\nrole of a prefactor fixed by the experiment. For the particular case\nof admixture from non-intentionally $p$-doped QDs as observed in our\nstudies, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty} should also remain suitable. Then\nthe parameters $S_\\infty(b=0)$ as well as $S_e(0)$\ninclude the same (field-independent) contributions from hole\nspins, respectively, such that the field-dependent part describes\nthe redistribution of electron spin noise from the Overhauser peak\ninto the zero-frequency peak, regardless of the amount of $p$-doped\nQDs in the sample.  \n \nIn order to find out whether the expression in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:s-infty} is sufficient to describe the data depicted in Fig.~\\ref{arealifetime}(b) under \nutilization of the CET parameters derived from the zero-field and transverse-field measurements ($\\delta_e$ = 110 MHz, $\\sim$20 \\% of hole doped QDs), we firstly\nderived a relation for the dimensionless magnetic field $b$ that contains both $\\delta_e$ and $B_z$. Therein, we put $\\Omega_B^e = \\hbar^{-1}g_e^{\\parallel}\\mu_BB_z$.    \nFurthermore, by taking $\\Omega_N^e$ to denote the Larmor frequency of the precession peak in the zero-field SNS, we can adopt (i) $\\Omega_N^e \\approx \\left(\\sqrt{2}T_e^*\\right)^{-1}$ as a major CET result \\cite{jh2014}, and (ii) $\\Omega_N^e = \\delta_e$ from the SCA \\cite{mg2012}, to obtain\n$T_e^* = \\left(\\sqrt{2}\\delta_e\\right)^{-1}$.
