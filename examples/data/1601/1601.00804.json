Fig.1(b) shows a carpet propelling\nwith an average speed of $\\langle v_{cp} \\rangle = 2.7 \\mu m s^{-1}$\nalong the $x$ direction, keeping its structure\nintact. During motion the carpet\ntrajectory is quite stable, presenting negligible\ndisplacements in the perpendicular direction.\nWe note that in contrast to the assembly stage,\nthe rotating field\nin the $(x,z)$ plane is now strongly elliptically\npolarized ($H_0>>H_z$) in order to maintain the\nstructure confined to two dimensions.\\\\\nAlthough the speed acquired by an individual\nparticle (rotor) moving close to the substrate is \nrelatively slow, for an ensemble of rotors forming the \ncarpet the effect becomes cooperative \nresulting in a faster translational motion. \nIn Fig.1(c) this effect is reflected by measuring\nthe average propulsion speed $\\langle v_{cp} \\rangle$ \nas a function of the number of rotors $N$ for a series \nof carpets having approximately a spherical shape. \nThe continuous dashed lines are averaged curves\nfrom the experimental data showing the general trend. \nWhile $\\langle v_{cp} \\rangle$ initially rapidly increases with $N$,\nit saturates around $N \\sim 300$, corresponding to a carpet \narea $S \\sim 1800 \\mu m^2$. Beyond this\nvalue, the rotors composing the colloidal structure start to \nbe far away and the cooperative effect reaches its \nmaximum efficiency.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth,keepaspectratio]{Fig3}\n\\caption{(Color online) (a) Sequence of images showing \nthe transport one yeast cell by combining \ntranslation and rotation of the carpet (MovieS3a). \nThe position of the tracked cell is superimposed as \na black line.

On the other hand, the propulsion \nspeed can be also increased via the driving \nfrequency (orange stars and red circles in Fig.1(c)), although this effect is less pronounced.\\\\\nThe maneuverability of our colloidal\nstructures is shown in Fig.2(a), where the\ncarpet is dynamically guided respectively towards\nthe left, south and north of the observation area.\nAs shown in MovieS2a, these turns are achieved by\ntemporary stopping the propulsion ($H_z=0$) and inducing\na rotational motion of the carpet by setting $\\omega_y=\\omega=942.5 rad s^{-1}$.\nThe change in direction is then obtained by restoring\nthe field but exchanging the phases and\nfrequencies of $H_x$ and $H_y$. In Figs2(b,c)\nwe explore the stability of the propelling\ncarpets by forcing them to move against an\nimmobile obstacle. As obstacle, we use\na $5 \\mu m$ silica particle which was\npermanently attached to the substrate.\nFig.2b (MovieS2b) shows the carpet dynamics\nwithout changing the applied field. In this\ncase the obstacle locally melts the moving\ncrystal of rotors, but strong attractive \ndipolar interactions prevent its disaggregation, \nfavoring re-crystallization templated by the ordered\nparticles surrounding the melted region. \nAn alternative method to pass the obstacle \nis presented in Fig.2c (MovieS2c), which \ncould be adopted to surpass larger obstacles. \nIn this particular situation, we split the carpet \ninto several pieces by setting temporary $H_y=0$ and\ndecreasing the perpendicular field $H_z$. \nThe absence of the $H_y$ component makes \nthe structure less stable during its \npropulsion, inducing the lateral \nseparation of the constituent \nparticles preferentially along \nthe crystalline axis as triggered by the\nobstacle. After crossing the obstacle, \nall pieces can be reassembled back by \nrestoring the field parameters. We note \nthat the splitting of the carpet into pieces \nleads to a final different colloidal structure.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth,keepaspectratio]{Fig4}\n\\caption{(Color online) Sequence of images showing the\nformation of two colloidal carpets\nfrom dispersed particles (top sequence)\nwithin a glass etched circular chamber ($115 \\mu m$ diameter).\nThe carpets are later transported across\nthin microchannels $20 \\mu m$\nwidth having (middle sequence) and finally the\nparticles are redispersed by switching off the applied\nfield $318.1s$ later (MovieS4).\nThe applied field parameters during transport\nare $H_0= 1900 A m^{-1}$, $H_z= 980 A m^{-1}$,\n$\\omega_z=942.5 Hz$.\nThe frequencies are $\\omega_x =\\omega_z/2$ and\n$\\omega_y =\\omega_z$ ($\\omega_x =\\omega_z$ and $\\omega_y =\\omega_z/2$)\nwhen the carpets move upward (leftward).}\n\\label{fig_4}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nNevertheless we find that in both cases (Fig.2b and Fig.2c) \nthe carpet is able to heal small wounds and to \nadapt its shape to the most compact structure \nafter crossing the obstacle.\\\\\nNon invasive approaches based on propulsive\ncolloids to move and displace micro-objects\nhave been achieved in the past by using elongated \nnanorods~\\cite{Pet12}, anisotropic particles~\\cite{Pal13},\nhelical~\\cite{Tot12} or\nother composite structures~\\cite{Sun08,Sak10}. Our\nself-assembled carpet allows to\nmanipulate and transport microscopic\ncargos over its extended area without\nrequirement of direct contact or chemical\nbinding. This feature is demonstrated in\nFig.3(a), corresponding MovieS3a, where\na carpet having an area of $S \\sim 1200 \\mu m^2$ is used\nto transport one yeast cell along a $95 \\mu m$ straight\npath. First, as shown in the Supporting videos (MovieS3b, MovieS3c),\nthe loading of the cargo, here a biological cell, can be realized \nby direct\nentrapment (MovieS3b) \nor by\nlifting the cargo when the carpet moves/rotates\nclose to it (MovieS3c). Once\nabove the magnetic carpet, the microscopic cargo\nis transported by using the hydrodynamic flow\ngenerated by the rotating particles.\nAs illustrated by the schematic of Fig.3(b),\nthis flow advects the colloidal carpet acting\nas a conveyor belt. Surprisingly, in contrast\nto other techniques to displace micro-objects,\nwe find that the cargo moves faster than the\nunderlying structure. For instance, in the\nspecific case of Fig.3(a), the yeast cell\ntravels at an average speed\nof $\\langle v_{cg} \\rangle = 3.5 \\mu m s^{-1}$,\ntwice larger than the speed of the carpet. \nThis behavior is independent of the cargo nature,\nas shown in Fig.3(d) where we found approximately\nthe same ratio by employing $5 \\mu m$ silica particles.\nAt parity of field strength, we observe that\nboth $\\langle v_{cg} \\rangle$ and\n$\\langle v_{cp} \\rangle$ increases linearly\nwith the frequency, and their ratio keeps constant.\nIncreasing $\\omega$ increases the rotational speed of the\nparticles and thus the hydrodynamic flux above and\nbelow the carpet. While the colloidal cargo is free\nto be dragged by this flux, the colloidal carpet is\nslower since being closer to the surface it experience\na larger hydrodynamic drag~\\cite{Rus89}. Faster speed of the cargo\nalso implies that the latter will reach the\nedge and leave the carpet in a finite period\nof time. In order to transport the cargo for\na longer distance, we manipulate the carpet\ninducing a $\\pi/2$ rotation each time the cell\nreaches the edge of the structure. In the\nparticular case of Fig.3(a), two of such\nrotations are required to allow the yeast\ncell to cover the whole observation area\nin $89.5s$.\nThe ability to assemble and transport\ncolloidal carpets close to a confining\nsurface creates many opportunities to\nintegrate them in a microfluidic platform.\nAs an illustrative example, in\nFig.4 we assemble and guide\ntwo colloidal carpets in a\nmicrofluidic environment.\nWe realized a $4 \\mu m$ depth\nchannel structure above a\nglass plate by using a wet\netching (HF) technique. The\nstructure is characterized\nby a network of circular\ncompartments having $115 \\mu m$\ndiameters and connected by\nchannels $20 \\mu m$ wide.\nFree paramagnetic colloids\npreviously collected in one circular\ncompartment are assembled into two separate\nclusters having sizes of $670 \\mu m^2$ and $430 \\mu m^2$ by an\nexternal rotating field. After $t=63.3s$, the rotating\nfield in the perpendicular plane is used to propel and\nto guide these colloidal carpets along the path connecting\nthe two chambers. Once reached the second compartment ($t=276.4s$),\nswitching off the applied field melts the carpets, dispersing the\nparticles evenly within the chamber. Even if no cargo has been\ntransported during this operation, one can use the paramagnetic\ncolloids directly as drug delivery vectors, since their\nsurface can be easily functionalized with chemical agents\nin order to bind and to transport functional molecules~\\cite{Yao11}.\nBesides the basic geometries shown in Fig.4, circuits having\nmore complex patterns can be equally explored by the propelling\ncarpets by simply adjusting on the fly, the orientation and\ndirection of the driving field.\\\\\nIn conclusion we developed a simple and\nversatile technique to magnetically assemble\nand propel highly reconfigurable colloidal\ncarpets in all direction of the plane. Although\nwe demonstrate this method with commercial available\nparamagnetic colloids, it can be easily extended\nto other types of recently developed particles with\nheterogeneous magnetic properties such as cubes~\\cite{Sac12},\nellipsoids~\\cite{Gu11}, Janus~\\cite{Sin11} or\nanisotropic~\\cite{Zer08} ones. As\nopposed to existing microscopic engines chemically powered\nor magnetically propelled, the mechanism of motion of our\ncarpets is cooperative and based on the rectification of\nthe hydrodynamic flow generated by each rotor close to the\nbounding wall. On the application side, we showed\nthat these mobile colloidal sheets can be used to\ntransport biological or colloidal cargos entrapped\nand translated via a hydrodynamic conveyor belt\neffect. Finally the carpets can be also used to\nassemble, maneuver and disperse microscopic\nparticles through a microfluidics network,\nmaking them suitable for fluid based microdevices.\\\\\n\nWe thank Ignacio Pagonabarraga Mora\nfor stimulating discussions.

To prevent convection\neffects,\nthe colloidal\nsuspension is sandwiched between a glass slide (Corning Incorporated)\nand a microscope coverslip\n(Agar Scientific), both separated by a double faced adhesive\ntape. As colloidal cargos we use\neither budding yeast cells ({\\it Saccharomyces\nCerevisiae}) or silica dioxide microspheres\n($5 \\mu m$ size, density $\\rho = 2.1 g cm^{-3}$)\nobtained from Sigma Aldrich.\\\\\nThe measurement cell is placed in the center\nof two orthogonal pairs of coils arranged on the\nstage of a light microscope (Eclipse Ni, Nikon),\nand aligned along\nthe $y$ and $x$ axis. A fifth coil aligned along $z$ is\ncentered just under the sample cell. To apply\ntime-dependent magnetic fields the coils\nare connected with a waveform generator (TGA1244, TTi)\nfeeding power amplifiers (AMP-1800, AKIYAMA and BOP\n20-10M, Kepco).\\\\\nThe paramagnetic colloids can be easily\nmagnetized by a relatively low external field\n$\\bm{H}$, acquiring a dipole moment $\\bm{m}=V\\chi \\bm{H}$ pointing along\nthe field direction. Here $V$ is the particle volume and \n$\\chi=0.4$ the magnetic susceptibility under a static field.\nFor a rotating field circularly polarized \nin the $(x,z)$ plane,\n$\\bm{H}=H_0(\\cos{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_x-\\sin{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_z)$,\nthe particle dynamics becomes more complicated due to\nthe presence of a finite magnetization relaxation\ntime $\\tau_{r}$~\\cite{Tie07,Jan09}.\nThe average magnetic torque applied to the particle\ncan be calculated as\n$\\bm{T}_{m}=\\mu_0 \\langle \\bm{m} \\times \\bm{H} \\rangle$,\nwhere $\\mu_0 = 4 \\pi \\cdot 10^{-7} \\, H m^{-1}$\nand $\\langle ... \\rangle$ denotes a time average.\nSolving the relaxation equation for\nthe magnetic moment~\\cite{Ceb11}\nwe find that,\n$\\bm{T}_{m}=\\frac{\\mu_0 V \\chi H_0^2 \\tau_{r} \\omega}{1+\\tau_{r}^2\\omega^2}\\bm{e}_y$,\nwhere $\\tau_r\\sim 10^{-4}s$ from independent measurements (data not shown).\nThe applied torque forces the particle to rotate\nat an average angular velocity $\\bm{\\Omega}$\nin the fluid medium.\nUpon balancing ${\\bm T}_m$ with\nthe viscous torque\narising from the rotation in the medium \n${\\bm T}_v=-8\\pi \\eta {\\bm \\Omega}a^3$\nthe average rotational speed reads as\n$\\langle \\Omega \\rangle = \\mu_0 H_0^2\\chi \\tau_{r} \\omega /6\\eta (1+ \\tau_{r}^2 \\omega^2)$.\nHere $\\eta=10^{-3} Pa \\cdot s$ denotes the dynamic viscosity of water.\\\\\nPair of rotors \nalso interact via \ndipolar forces. \nThe interaction potential\nbetween two equal dipoles\n$(i,j)$, at a distance\n$\\bm{r}$ away,\nis given by\n$U_{dd}=\\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}(\\frac{{\\bm m}_i {\\bm m}_j}{r^3}-\\frac{3({\\bm m}_i \\cdot {\\bm r})({\\bm m}_j\\cdot {\\bm r}) }{r^5})$,\nand is maximally attractive (repulsive) for particles with\nmagnetic moments parallel (normal) to $\\bm{r}$.\nTime averaging $U_{dd}$\nfor a rotating magnetic field in the $(x,y)$\nplane gives an  effective attractive potential\nin this plane $\\langle U_{dd} \\rangle =-\\frac{\\mu_0 m^2}{8 \\pi (x+y)^3}$.\nThis interaction potential\ncan be thus used to magnetically\nassemble highly ordered 2D particle monolayers~\\cite{Ost09,Yan14}.\\\\\nFig.1(a) shows the general procedure\nto realize and to propel a magnetic carpet.\nFirst compact clusters are realized by applying\nan external uniform magnetic field circularly polarized \nin the $(x,y)$ plane parallel to the glass surface, \n$\\bm{H}\\equiv H_0(\\cos{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_x-\\sin{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_y)$,\nbeing  $\\omega$ the angular frequency and $H_0$ the amplitude.\nThe applied field induces dipolar interactions\nbetween the magnetic colloids which are in \naverage attractive, and the particles rapidly \nassemble into a close packed cluster free\nof defects or vacancies. The colloidal clusters \nare stable only in presence of the driving field, \nwhile immediately disintegrate due to thermal \nfluctuations once the applied field is switched \noff. As reported in previous works on assembly of \n\"magnetic holes\"~\\cite{Hel08} or Janus colloids~\\cite{Yan15}, \nwe observe that when the cluster is formed, \nit continues to rotate but at a smaller \nangular frequency than that imposed by the \ndriving field. The cluster rotation arises \nfrom an unbalanced viscous shear force \nexperienced by the torque particles located \nat the edge of the cluster~\\cite{Yan15,Sch12}.\nOnce the carpets are formed, propulsion is obtained by \napplying a rotating field in the ($x,z$) plane plus an\nadditional component oscillating with angular \nfrequency $\\omega_y$\nalong the perpendicular direction($y$). \nThe total field is given by:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\bm{H}\\equiv H_0 (\\cos{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_x+\\sin{(\\omega_y t)}\\bm{e}_y-\\frac{H_z}{H_0}\\sin{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_z),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\bm{H}\\equiv H_{0}(\\cos{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_{x}+\\sin{(\\omega_{y}t)}\\bm{e}_{y}-%&#10;\\frac{H_{z}}{H_{0}}\\sin{(\\omega t)}\\bm{e}_{z}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc6f</mi><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc86</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>y</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc86</mi><mi>y</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>z</mi></msub><msub><mi>H</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc86</mi><mi>z</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
