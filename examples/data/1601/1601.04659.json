Our study is carried out within a \nTaylor-Couette setup for two  rotation laws: quasi-Kepler and solid-body \nrotation.  The minimum  magnetic Prandtl number used is $0.05$  while the molecular \nSchmidt number ${\\mbox{Sc}}$ of the fluid varies between $0.1$ and $2$ where the latter \nvalue characterizes  the solar tachocline.  An effective diffusivity coefficient \nfor the mixing  is numerically measured by the decay process of a global \nconcentration peak located  between both cylinder walls.  We find that  only models \nwith  ${\\mbox{Sc}}$ exceeding  0.1 do basically provide finite eddy diffusivity values.\nWe also find that for quasi-Kepler rotation  at a  magnetic Mach number \n${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$ the flow transits from the slow-rotation regime to the  \nfast-rotation regime  dominated by the Taylor-Proudman theorem.  Just for this latter\nstate, the eddy diffusivity  values peak in their dependence on the Reynolds number of the global rotation. \nFor fixed Reynolds number the relation between the normalized eddy diffusivity \nand the Schmidt number of the fluid is always  linear so that also a linear \nrelation between the eddy diffusivity and the molecular viscosity results  \nexactly in the sense proposed by Schatzman  (1977). The numerical value of the coefficient in this \nrelation, here called the Schatzman number, will reach a maximum at ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$ and will rapidly decrease for large ${\\mbox{Mm}}$.\nBecause of the high values of the solar Hartmann number, the Schatzman number would strongly exceed  the value of about 100 needed  to describe the \nmixing below the solar convection zone.   After our  results, however,  the diffusion coefficient will be strongly suppressed  by the solar rotation  if its \nmagnetic Mach number fulfills ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\gg 1$ implying  that only toroidal  magnetic fields of order kG can exist in the solar tachocline.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\keywords{Instabilities - Magnetic fields - Diffusion - Turbulence - Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)}\n\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nSome  of the open problems in the modern stellar physics are related to empirical findings    of  rotational periods.\nNumerical simulations of supernova explosions  yield rotation periods of 1 ms \nfor the newborn neutron stars but the observations provide periods which are \nmuch longer. Less compact objects like the White Dwarfs are predicted to have equatorial velocities higher than \n15 km/s, but observations show velocities lower than 10 km/s (Berger et al. 2005). Obviously, an outward transport of angular momentum \nhappened which cannot be explained with the molecular values of the \nviscosity. As the cores of the progenitor of newborn neutron stars and White \ndwarfs are always stably stratified an alternative instability must exist in the \nfar-developed main-sequence stars which transports angular momentum but which \ndoes not lead to a too intensive mixing, which seems incompatible with observations of surface abundances in massive stars (Brott et al. 2008).\n\nEven solar observations lead to similar  conclusions. The present-day solar core \nrotates rigidly but the  convection zone still contains lithium  which after a \ndiffusion process between  the convection zone and the burning region 40.000 km \nunder its bottom is destroyed. In order to explain the lithium decay time of \nabout 1....10 Gyr the effective diffusion coefficient must exceed the molecular \nviscosity  by one or two orders of magnitude. Schatzman (1969, 1977) suggested \nsome sort of instability -- appearing in the stably stratified stellar radiation\nzones -- as the generator of such   mild extra transport of passive chemicals. \nLebreton \\& Maeder (1987) considered for the mixing in the  solar model a \nrelation $D^*={Re}^* \\nu$ for the diffusion coefficient (after the notation of \nSchatzman, see Zahn 1990)  with ${ Re}^*\\simeq 100$. This is a rather small \nvalue which leads  to   $D^*{\\lower.4ex\\hbox{$\\;\\buildrel <\\over{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\;$}} 10^3$ cm$^2$/s for the solar plasma shortly \nbelow the solar tachocline.  Brun et al. (1998) work with ${ Re}^*\\simeq 20$ \nwhile a more refined model of the solar radiative zone starts from the molecular \nvalue  $D\\simeq 10$ cm$^2$/s and reaches  $D^*\\simeq 10^{2....4}$ under the \ninfluence of a heuristically  postulated hydrodynamical instability (Brun et al. 1999).\n\nOn the other hand, in order to reproduce  the rigid rotation of the solar \ninterior the viscosity must exceed its molecular value by more than two orders \nof magnitude.  R\\\"udiger \\& Kitchatinov (1996)  assume  that internal differential rotation \ninteracts with a fossil poloidal magnetic field within the core.  The rotation \nbecomes uniform along the field lines.   A problem is formed by the   `islands' \nof fast rotation  due to the non uniformity of the field lines. A  viscosity of \nmore than  $10^{4} $ cm$^2$/s is needed to smooth out such artificial  peaks in \nthe resulting rotation laws.\n\nThe   value of $3\\cdot 10^4$~cm$^2$/s is  also reported by Eggenberger et al. (2012) to produce an internal rotation law of the red giant {KIC 8366239}  \nconsistent with asteroseismic results obtained by the {\\sc Kepler}  \nmission Beck et al. (2012). Also, Deheuvels et al. (2012, 2014)\nderive  an internal rotation profile of  the early red giant KIC 7341231  with a \ncore spinning at least five times faster than the surface. This is  less than  the \nstellar evolution codes yield  without extra angular momentum transport from the \ncore  to the envelope Ceillier et al. (2012). \n  \nThat the effective viscosity is stronger  amplified than the effective \ndiffusivity suggests a magnetic background of the phenomena. Magnetic \nfluctuations transport angular momentum via the Maxwell stress but they do not \ntransport chemicals. Most sorts of MHD turbulence should thus provide higher \neddy viscosity values rather than eddy diffusivity values, i.e. both Prandtl \nnumbers as well as the Schmidt number must not exceed unity.\n\nIn the present paper the Tayler instability (Tayler 1957, 1973) under the presence of \n(differential) rotation is probed to produce diffusion coefficients for passive \nscalars. By linear theory the instability map is obtained for the unstable \nnonaxisymmetric mode with $m=1$. The eigenvalue problem is formulated for a \ncylindrical Taylor-Couette container where the gap between both rotating \ncylinders is filled with a conducting fluid of given magnetic Prandtl number. \nInside the cylinders homogeneous axial electric-currents exist which produce an \nazimuthal magnetic field with the fixed radial profile $B_\\phi\\propto R$ which \n-- if strong enough -- is unstable even without rotation. It is known  that for \nmagnetic Prandtl number of order unity a rigid rotation strongly suppresses the \ninstability but -- as we shall show -- a differential rotation with negative \nshear re-destabilizes the flow so that a wide domain exists in the instability \nmap wherein the  nonlinear code provides the spectra of the  flow and field \nfluctuations.  Between the rotating cylinders a steep radial profile  for the \nconcentration of a passive scalar is initially established which decays in time by the \naction of the flow fluctuations. The decay time is then  determined in order to \nfind the diffusion coefficient.\n\n\n\n\\section{The rotating pinch}\n\nIn a Taylor-Couette setup, a fluid with   microscopic viscosity $\\nu$ and  \nmagnetic diffusivity $\\eta=1/\\mu_0\\sigma$ ($\\sigma$ the electric conductivity) \nand a homogeneous axial \ncurrent ${\\mbox{\\boldmath${J}$}}=\\textrm{curl}\\, {\\mbox{\\boldmath${B}$}}$ are considered.

The diffusion equation is numerically solved  in a cylindric \nsetup under the influence of stochastic fluctuations which are due to the \nmagnetic Tayler instability. The conducting fluid between two rotating \ncylinders  becomes unstable if an axial uniform electric-current is strong \nenough. The rotation law between the two cylinders is fixed by their rotation; \nour main application is a quasi-Kepler rotation which results when the \ncylinders are rotating like planets. The magnetic Prandtl number of the \nfluid is fixed to the value of 0.1 while its Schmidt number (\\ref{Sc}) \nis a free parameter of the model.\n\nThe main result is a strictly linear  relation between the resulting normalized \neddy diffusivity $D^*/D$ and the given Schmidt number.  The Schatzman relation \n(\\ref{schatz}) -- which also describes our  result that for small Schmidt number \nthe eddy diffusivity is negligibly small -- has thus been confirmed in a \nself-consistent way. \n\nThe model also provides numerical values  for the scaling factor $Re^*$ which \nincreases for increasing Hartmann number of the toroidal field.   For Schmidt numbers \n${\\lower.4ex\\hbox{$\\;\\buildrel <\\over{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\;$}} 0.1$ the diffusivity due to the magnetic instability is negligibly small,  however  \n$Re^*$ is different from zero and even exceeds unity in our computations.  Already for the value ${\\mbox{Ha}}=80$ one finds \n$Re^*{\\lower.4ex\\hbox{$\\;\\buildrel <\\over{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\;$}} 4$ for quasi-Kepler rotation and this value increases for increasing Hartmann number (Fig. \\ref{ratvspr}).\n\nThe second result concerns the role of the  magnetic Mach number ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ which \nrepresents the global rotation in relation to the magnetic field strength. For \nslow rotation the eddy diffusivity runs linear with ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ but in all cases  a \nmaximum of $D^*/D$ exists  at ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$. For faster rotation the induced diffusion \nis suppressed and finally seems to remain constant  (Fig. \\ref{f4}). This fast-rotation \nphenomenon may be a consequence of the Taylor-Proudman theorem after which  the \naxial fluctuations are favored in expense of the radial ones. Also the \ncorrelation lengths  in axial direction grow for growing Reynolds numbers. Both \nconsequences of the Taylor-Proudman theorem appear to retard  the growth of the \nradial diffusion in stars. \n \\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,angle=-90]{slope2vsHApm0.1.eps}\n\\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,angle=-90]{pmdepend.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{SCHVSMm.eps}\n\\caption{The Schatzman number $Re^*$ vs. ${\\mbox{Re}}$ as  functions of ${\\mbox{Ha}}$ (top panel), of ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ (middle panel) and of ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ (bottom panel).\nIn the bottom panel all the simulations of  this study are shown. $\\mu=0.35$.}\n\\label{Schatzman}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{Schatzman} summarizes the results  of this study by presenting  \nnumerical values of $Re^*$ for Kepler rotation laws.   In the upper panel  \n$Re^*$ is given for four values of the Hartmann numbers as a function of the Reynolds \nnumber.  Without rotation one finds that $Re^*\\propto {\\mbox{Ha}}$ is realized which for \nsolar/stellar ${\\mbox{Ha}}$-values would produce even  higher $Re^*$-values  that the\nones found in our computations.  With rotation, a  maximum\nof $Re^*$ exists for approximately one and the same magnetic Mach number \n(${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2 $) where  the value of $Re^*$ strongly increases with the \nHartmann number. The higher the Hartmann number the larger  $Re^*$,  but this relation is not  strictly  linear  as a mild  \nsaturation  may exist. For ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\gg 2$ the rotational quenching  leads to\n$Re^*$ even smaller than the values for $ {\\mbox{Re}}=0$.\n\nThe numerical restrictions of our code prevent   calculations for    \nhigher Reynolds numbers but we are able to  vary the magnetic Prandtl number.  \nThis might  be necessary  as ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ in the solar tachocline is certainly \nsmaller than 0.1. Figure  \\ref{Schatzman} (middle panel) shows the clear \nresult  that $Re^*$ is anticorrelated with the magnetic Prandtl number. The  \nsmaller ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ the larger $Re^*$, without rotation there is even $Re^*\\propto \n1/{\\mbox{Pm}}$. For fast rotation  the results do not exclude the possibility that a \nsaturation may occur  for ${\\mbox{Pm}}\\ll 0.1$  so that the influence of ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ becomes \nweaker as  the close lines of marginal instability in Fig.~\\ref{f1} for small ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ suggest. \n\n\nThe bottom panel completes the picture showing $Re^*$ as a function of ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ for all simulations \nused in this study.  It shows that  $Re^*$ has a maximum at ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$ and  rapidly decreases \nfor large ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ for which it seems to saturate around $Re^{*}=1$.\n\n\nA final answer of how large the Schatzman number $Re^*$   may become by the \npresented  mechanism of  nonaxisymmetric instabilities of azimuthal fields can \nnot yet be given, mainly due to  numerical limitations.  All the used dimensionless \nnumbers such as the Reynolds number and the magnetic Mach number   are  \ndifferent from the real (solar) numbers by orders of magnitudes. That the model, proposed \nin this paper to estimate the magnetic induced extra diffusivity, \ndirectly  leads to the  original formulation of  Schatzman seems to be  a  \nhighly motivating  result. Using the maximal $Re^*$ values of our curves (which hold \nfor ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$) and by rescaling to the real solar/stellar Hartmann numbers \nthe resulting $Re^*$-values  would become much too high. The curves in Fig. \n\\ref{Schatzman}, however, demonstrate a dramatic rotational suppression of the \ndiffusion process for higher ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ so that the small values $Re^*\\simeq 100$ \nwhich are necessary to explain the observations may easily result from the \nintensive  quenching by   the global rotation belonging to magnetic Mach numbers \nexceeding (say) 30. A theoretical explanation of the slow diffusion effects \nwith magnetic instabilities, therefore, requires differential  rotation and weak \nfields (of order kG) as otherwise the mixing would be too effective.\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[height=0.37\\textwidth,angle=-90]{AATDvsPM.eps}\n\\caption{The normalized instability-induced diffusivity $\\eta^{*}/\\eta$ for the differentially rotating pinch  as a function of ${\\mbox{Pm}}$  for the Reynolds  and Hartman number yielding the maximal  $Re^*$.

The diffusion equation is numerically solved  in a cylindric \nsetup under the influence of stochastic fluctuations which are due to the \nmagnetic Tayler instability. The conducting fluid between two rotating \ncylinders  becomes unstable if an axial uniform electric-current is strong \nenough. The rotation law between the two cylinders is fixed by their rotation; \nour main application is a quasi-Kepler rotation which results when the \ncylinders are rotating like planets. The magnetic Prandtl number of the \nfluid is fixed to the value of 0.1 while its Schmidt number (\\ref{Sc}) \nis a free parameter of the model.\n\nThe main result is a strictly linear  relation between the resulting normalized \neddy diffusivity $D^*/D$ and the given Schmidt number.  The Schatzman relation \n(\\ref{schatz}) -- which also describes our  result that for small Schmidt number \nthe eddy diffusivity is negligibly small -- has thus been confirmed in a \nself-consistent way. \n\nThe model also provides numerical values  for the scaling factor $Re^*$ which \nincreases for increasing Hartmann number of the toroidal field.   For Schmidt numbers \n${\\lower.4ex\\hbox{$\\;\\buildrel <\\over{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\;$}} 0.1$ the diffusivity due to the magnetic instability is negligibly small,  however  \n$Re^*$ is different from zero and even exceeds unity in our computations.  Already for the value ${\\mbox{Ha}}=80$ one finds \n$Re^*{\\lower.4ex\\hbox{$\\;\\buildrel <\\over{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\;$}} 4$ for quasi-Kepler rotation and this value increases for increasing Hartmann number (Fig. \\ref{ratvspr}).\n\nThe second result concerns the role of the  magnetic Mach number ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ which \nrepresents the global rotation in relation to the magnetic field strength. For \nslow rotation the eddy diffusivity runs linear with ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ but in all cases  a \nmaximum of $D^*/D$ exists  at ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$. For faster rotation the induced diffusion \nis suppressed and finally seems to remain constant  (Fig. \\ref{f4}). This fast-rotation \nphenomenon may be a consequence of the Taylor-Proudman theorem after which  the \naxial fluctuations are favored in expense of the radial ones. Also the \ncorrelation lengths  in axial direction grow for growing Reynolds numbers. Both \nconsequences of the Taylor-Proudman theorem appear to retard  the growth of the \nradial diffusion in stars. \n \\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,angle=-90]{slope2vsHApm0.1.eps}\n\\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,angle=-90]{pmdepend.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{SCHVSMm.eps}\n\\caption{The Schatzman number $Re^*$ vs. ${\\mbox{Re}}$ as  functions of ${\\mbox{Ha}}$ (top panel), of ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ (middle panel) and of ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ (bottom panel).\nIn the bottom panel all the simulations of  this study are shown. $\\mu=0.35$.}\n\\label{Schatzman}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{Schatzman} summarizes the results  of this study by presenting  \nnumerical values of $Re^*$ for Kepler rotation laws.   In the upper panel  \n$Re^*$ is given for four values of the Hartmann numbers as a function of the Reynolds \nnumber.  Without rotation one finds that $Re^*\\propto {\\mbox{Ha}}$ is realized which for \nsolar/stellar ${\\mbox{Ha}}$-values would produce even  higher $Re^*$-values  that the\nones found in our computations.  With rotation, a  maximum\nof $Re^*$ exists for approximately one and the same magnetic Mach number \n(${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2 $) where  the value of $Re^*$ strongly increases with the \nHartmann number. The higher the Hartmann number the larger  $Re^*$,  but this relation is not  strictly  linear  as a mild  \nsaturation  may exist. For ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\gg 2$ the rotational quenching  leads to\n$Re^*$ even smaller than the values for $ {\\mbox{Re}}=0$.\n\nThe numerical restrictions of our code prevent   calculations for    \nhigher Reynolds numbers but we are able to  vary the magnetic Prandtl number.  \nThis might  be necessary  as ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ in the solar tachocline is certainly \nsmaller than 0.1. Figure  \\ref{Schatzman} (middle panel) shows the clear \nresult  that $Re^*$ is anticorrelated with the magnetic Prandtl number. The  \nsmaller ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ the larger $Re^*$, without rotation there is even $Re^*\\propto \n1/{\\mbox{Pm}}$. For fast rotation  the results do not exclude the possibility that a \nsaturation may occur  for ${\\mbox{Pm}}\\ll 0.1$  so that the influence of ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ becomes \nweaker as  the close lines of marginal instability in Fig.~\\ref{f1} for small ${\\mbox{Pm}}$ suggest. \n\n\nThe bottom panel completes the picture showing $Re^*$ as a function of ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ for all simulations \nused in this study.  It shows that  $Re^*$ has a maximum at ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$ and  rapidly decreases \nfor large ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ for which it seems to saturate around $Re^{*}=1$.\n\n\nA final answer of how large the Schatzman number $Re^*$   may become by the \npresented  mechanism of  nonaxisymmetric instabilities of azimuthal fields can \nnot yet be given, mainly due to  numerical limitations.  All the used dimensionless \nnumbers such as the Reynolds number and the magnetic Mach number   are  \ndifferent from the real (solar) numbers by orders of magnitudes. That the model, proposed \nin this paper to estimate the magnetic induced extra diffusivity, \ndirectly  leads to the  original formulation of  Schatzman seems to be  a  \nhighly motivating  result. Using the maximal $Re^*$ values of our curves (which hold \nfor ${\\mbox{Mm}}\\simeq 2$) and by rescaling to the real solar/stellar Hartmann numbers \nthe resulting $Re^*$-values  would become much too high. The curves in Fig. \n\\ref{Schatzman}, however, demonstrate a dramatic rotational suppression of the \ndiffusion process for higher ${\\mbox{Mm}}$ so that the small values $Re^*\\simeq 100$ \nwhich are necessary to explain the observations may easily result from the \nintensive  quenching by   the global rotation belonging to magnetic Mach numbers \nexceeding (say) 30. A theoretical explanation of the slow diffusion effects \nwith magnetic instabilities, therefore, requires differential  rotation and weak \nfields (of order kG) as otherwise the mixing would be too effective.\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[height=0.37\\textwidth,angle=-90]{AATDvsPM.eps}\n\\caption{The normalized instability-induced diffusivity $\\eta^{*}/\\eta$ for the differentially rotating pinch  as a function of ${\\mbox{Pm}}$  for the Reynolds  and Hartman number yielding the maximal  $Re^*$.
