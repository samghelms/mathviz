With this, simulations \nshow that the fraction $f_{\\rm gas}(z)$ of baryonic mass to total mass in \ngalaxy clusters should be nearly constant with redshift $z$. However,\nthe measurement of these quantities depends on the angular distance to the source,\nwhich evolves with $z$ according to the assumed background cosmology. An accurate \ndetermination of $f_{\\rm gas}(z)$ for a large sample of hot ($kT_e> 5$ keV), \ndynamically relaxed clusters could therefore be used as a probe of the \ncosmological expansion up to $z< 2$. The fraction $f_{\\rm gas}(z)$\nwould remain constant only when the ``correct\" cosmology is used to fit the data. \nIn this paper, we compare the predicted gas mass fractions for both $\\Lambda$CDM \nand the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe and test them against the 3 largest cluster samples \n\\cite{1,2,3}. We show that $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ is consistent with a constant\n$f_{\\rm gas}$ in the redshift range $z\\lesssim 2$, as was previously shown \nfor the reference $\\Lambda$CDM model (with parameter values $H_0=70$ km s$^{-1}$ \nMpc$^{-1}$, $\\Omega_m=0.3$ and $w_\\Lambda=-1$). Unlike $\\Lambda$CDM, however, \nthe $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe has no free parameters to optimize in fitting the \ndata. Model selection tools, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) \nand the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), therefore tend to favor \n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ over $\\Lambda$CDM. For example, the BIC favours $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ \nwith a likelihood of $\\sim 95\\%$ versus $\\sim 5\\%$ for $\\Lambda$CDM.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{fmtext}\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe idea that clusters might provide an independent probe of cosmological\nexpansion took root following a series of non-radiative hydrodynamical\nsimulations showing that the gas mass fraction, $f_{\\rm gas}=M_{\\rm gas}/\nM_{\\rm tot}$, in \n\\end{fmtext}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\noindent the largest (i.e., $kT>5$ keV) dynamically relaxed clusters,\nremains approximately constant with redshift \\cite{4,5}. Here, $M_{\\rm gas}$ \nis the mass of the intracluster medium and $M_{\\rm tot}$ is the total mass of the \ncluster. These results followed seminal papers by Sasaki \\cite{6} and Pen \\cite{7},\nwho argued that the measurement of apparent evolution (or non-evolution) in\n$f_{\\rm gas}$ could be used to examine the angular distance to \nthese sources as a function of redshift. Since then, several groups have \npursued this line of work, compiling extensive catalogs of clusters suitable \nfor such a study \\cite{1,2,3,8,9}. In conjuction with this observational work,\nmore elaborate simulations, incorporating several key physical ingredients, such\nas radiative cooling and the dynamical impact of turbulence, have provided a more\nrealistic assessment of the conditions and cluster size for which $f_{\\rm gas}$\nmight in fact be expected to remain constant.\n\nUnder the (as yet unproven) assumption that the baryonic to dark\nmatter densities, $\\rho_b/\\rho_{d}$, is independent of redshift at\nleast out to $z\\lesssim 2$, the geometry of the Universe can be constrained\nin this way because the measured baryonic mass fraction depends on the\nassumed angular diameter distance to the source, which is used along with\nthe inferred density to obtain $M_{\\rm gas}$. (This assumption may have\nto be modified if, and when, new physics beyond the standard model\nimplies that baryons and/or dark matter may be created or annihilated with\ntime since the big bang.) The baryonic matter content of galaxy clusters is\ndominated by the X-ray emitting intracluster gas, whose mass exceeds that\nof optically luminous material by a factor $\\sim 6$ \\cite{10,11}.\nThe other contributions to the total baryon\nbudget are expected to be very small. The emissivity of the X-ray\nemitting gas is proportional to the square of its density, so the gas\nmass profile in a cluster can be determined precisely from X-ray data.\nMeasuring $M_{\\rm tot}$ is more difficult because it is often based on\nthe assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in the gas, from which one\nmay infer the depth of the gravitational potential required to maintain\nthe density profile. Thus, only dynamically relaxed systems can be used\nfor this purpose. In addition, as we will consider in more detail below,\none would expect a constant mass fraction only for the very massive clusters,\nwith minimal impact from astrophysical factors, such as feedback and cooling.\nBut though cosmological simulations suggest that\nunder some circumstances $f_{\\rm gas}$ should be invariant with redshift,\nwe would only see this in the data if the underlying model used to interpret\nthe measurements is the correct cosmology. So in principle one may\ncarry out a comparative test between competing models to see\nwhich, if any, predicts a constant value of $f_{\\rm gas}$ with\nchanging $z$.\n\n\\subsection{The Constancy of $f_{\\rm gas}$}\nThe caveat here is that the constancy of $f_{\\rm gas}$ with\nredshift should be independent of the expansion dynamics. One\nwould certainly be justified in expecting this if $\\rho_b/\\rho_{d}$\nhas not changed with $z$. However,\nto use this feature as a cosmological tool, we have to believe that\na sample of clusters exists for which $f_{\\rm gas}$ is independent\nof which version of $\\Lambda$CDM (or other cosmology) we are\ncomparing with the data. For if the behavior of $f_{\\rm gas}$\nwith redshift were different for different expansion rates,\nwe could not be certain that $f_{\\rm gas}$ should in fact remain\nconstant.\n\nIn their high-resolution simulations, Kravtsov et al. \\cite{12} incorporated\nthe effects of radiative cooling and galaxy formation on the baryon\nfraction, including the impact on star formation, metal enrichment,\nand stellar feedback. These processes increase the total baryon\nfraction within scales as large as the virial radius, though it is\nwithin the cluster cores that baryon fractions larger than the universal\nvalue are seen. However, even with cooling, the cumulative baryon\nfraction is close to its universal value at radii $r>r_{2,500}$, where\n$r_\\Delta$ is defined to be the radius within which the average cluster\ndensity is greater than its critical value by a factor $\\Delta$ at\nthat redshift (see equation~2.12 below). Moreover, even though the baryon\nfraction may be different from its universal value at smaller radii,\nsimulations such as this suggest that the total baryon fraction within\nthe cluster virial radius does not evolve with time, regardless of\nwhether or not cooling is included.\n\nSimulations with even greater sophistication than these were carried\nout by Ettori et al. \\cite{13}, this time including also the effects of\nfeedback through galactic winds and conduction. They found that the\nbaryon fraction within a fixed overdensity increases slightly with\nredshift, though the impact at large cluster-centric distances\n(i.e., $r>r_{500}$) is nearly independent of the physics included\nin the calculations. More recently, Planelles et al. \\cite{14} updated\nthese simulations by including feedback from supernovae and active\ngalactic nuclei. They too found that the baryon fraction is nearly\nindependent of the physical processes, and is characterized by a\nnegligible redshift evolution, if the cluster mass $M_{500}$ at\n$r_{500}$ is $\\gtrsim 10^{14}\\;M_\\odot$. At smaller radii, $r_{2,500}$,\nits value slightly decreases, while its scatter increases by about\na factor of 2. As we shall see, the cluster catalogs currently\navailable for this cosmological test differ in their assumed overdensity\nfactor $\\Delta$, so $f_{\\rm gas}$ may not be uniformly constant with\nredshift from sample to sample. This is an important caveat to\nconsider when weighing the results of model comparisons using\ndifferent cluster catalogs. In this paper, we will consider the\n3 largest samples, two of which assume $\\Delta=2,500$ \\cite{1,2}, \nwhile the third adopts the value $\\Delta=500$ \\cite{3}.\n\n\\subsection{Testing Cosmological Models with $f_{\\rm gas}$}\nUp until now, the cluster gas mass fraction has been used\nto probe only the parameter space associated with the standard\nmodel of cosmology, $\\Lambda$CDM. The reference model often\nused for this work assumes a spatially flat universe ($k=0$) with a scaled\nmatter density $\\Omega_m\\equiv \\rho_m/\\rho_c=0.3$, where\n$\\rho_m=\\rho_b+\\rho_{d}$ is the matter density and $\\rho_c\\equiv 3c^2H_0^2/\n8\\pi G$ is the critical density in terms of the Hubble constant\n$H_0$ today, and a dark energy in the form of\na cosmological constant with equation-of-state $w_{\\Lambda}\\equiv\np_{\\Lambda}/\\rho_{\\Lambda}=-1$, in terms of its pressure $p_{\\Lambda}$\nand density $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$. Since these clusters lie at redshifts\n$z< 1.5$, where the contribution of radiation to the total energy density\nis below detectability, one can also assume that $\\Omega_m+\n\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=1$. In obvious notation, $\\Omega_\\Lambda\\equiv\n\\rho_\\Lambda/\\rho_c$.\n\nBut in recent years, evidence has been accumulating that $\\Lambda$CDM\nis perhaps the empirical approximation to a more theoretically motivated FRW\ncosmology known as the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe \\cite{15,16,17}.\n(A somewhat pedagogical treament may be found in \nref. \\cite{18}.) The latter arises when\none invokes Birkhoff's theorem \\cite{19} together with Weyl's\npostulate \\cite{20}, which lead to an identification of the Hubble\nradius $R_{\\rm h}=c/H$ as another manifestation of the Universe's\ngravitational horizon, $2GM/c^2$, defined in terms of the\nMisner-Sharp mass $M$ contained within a proper spherical volume\nof radius $R_{\\rm h}$ \\cite{21}. It must therefore\nitself be a proper distance $R_{\\rm h}=a(t)r_{\\rm h}$, where\n$a(t)$ is the universal expansion factor and $r_{\\rm h}$ is an\nunchanging co-moving distance. This form of $R_{\\rm h}$ leads\nimmediately to the condition that $\\dot{a}=$ constant. Thus,\nthe $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe expands at a constant rate.\n\nThis cosmology should not be confused with the Milne Universe\n\\cite{22}, which is empty and has negative spatial curvature\n($k=-1$). The Milne Universe does not at all fit the\ncosmological data and was ruled out as a viable model\nlong ago. Instead, the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe is flat ($k=0$)\nand predicts very simple, analytical forms for measurable\nquantities, such as the luminosity distance,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nd_L^{R_{\\rm h}}=R_{\\rm h}(1+z)\\ln(1+z)\\;,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"d_{L}^{R_{\\rm h}}=R_{\\rm h}(1+z)\\ln(1+z)\\;,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>d</mi><mi>L</mi><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">h</mi></msub></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">h</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.3pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04649.tex", "nexttext": "\nWe will provide a more detailed description of the differences\nbetween $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ and $\\Lambda$CDM in \\S~3 below.\n\nBy now, the predictions of these two cosmologies have been\ncompared to each other using many diverse tests\nand available data, including: the cosmic chronometers\n\\cite{23}, the gamma-ray burst Hubble diagram\n\\cite{24}, the high-$z$ quasars \\cite{25}, the angular\ncorrelation function of the cosmic microwave background radiation\n\\cite{26}, and the high-$z$ galaxies \\cite{27}, among\nothers (some not yet published).

Often, $\\Delta$ is taken to be\n2,500 (as in refs. \\cite{1,2}; see next section),\nbut not always. (This is one of several reasons why we cannot combine\nall of the available samples to carry out a single fitting procedure. As we shall see\nin the next section, it is necessary to carry out the fitting for each individual\ncompilation of sources. Some discussion concerning which value is more trustworthy in\nmeasuring $f_{\\rm gas}$ appears in refs. \\cite{30,31}.)\nThe third data set we are using \\cite{3} assumes $\\Delta=500$.\n\nSo there is an additional dependence of $f_{\\rm gas}$ on the background\ncosmology, beyond simply the factor appearing in Equation~(2.9), because\n$r_{2,500}$ (or $r_{500}$) itself changes with the model. The reasoning\nbehind this is rather simple to understand \\cite{2}. On the one hand,\nwe know that the total mass within $r_{2,500}$ is given by the expression\n$M_{2,500}=(4\\pi/3)r_{2,500}^3(2,500\\,\\rho_c)$. But since both $T_e$\nand the density gradient in Equation~(2.7) are approximately constant in\nthe region of $\\theta_{2,500}$, the hydrostatic equilibrium equation\ngives $M_{2,500}\\propto r_{2,500}$ (see Equation~2.8). These two\nexpressions should be equal, and since $\\rho_c\\sim H(z)^2$, we see\nthat $r_{2,500}\\sim H(z)^{-1}$. Thus, the angle spanned by $r_{2,500}$\nat $z$ is $\\theta_{2,500}=r_{2,500}/d_A\\sim (H\\,d_A)^{-1}$. According\nto ref. \\cite{2}, the slope of $f_{\\rm gas}(r/r_{2,500})$ in the\nregion of $r_{2,500}$ is $\\eta\\sim 0.214\\pm0.022$ over their\nsample range $0.7<r/r_{2,500}<1.2$, for the reference $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel described in the introduction. Therefore, since the angle\nsubtended by $r_{2,500}$ changes with the cosmology, one\nexpects that $f_{\\rm gas}\\sim \\theta_{2,500}^{-\\eta}\\sim\n(H\\,d_A)^\\eta$, over and above the primary dependence given\nin Equation~(2.9). This angular correction factor is close to unity\nfor all cosmologies and redshifts of interest, but ought to be included\nfor completeness.\n\nGiven the strong dependence of the inferred values of $M_{\\rm gas}$\nand $M_{\\rm tot}$ on the assumed cosmology, the\ndata need to be recalibrated for each considered model.  However,\na procedure has been developed by the groups who analyze these\nclusters, in which the data are reduced once for the reference\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, and then are fitted with modifications\nto the reference model based on its differences with the cosmology\nbeing tested.

If the EOS were known,\nthe dynamical equations governing the Universal expansion could be solved exactly,\nand the observations could then be interpreted unambiguously. Unfortunately, we\nmust rely on measurements and assumptions to pick $\\rho$ and $p$. At the very minimum,\n$\\rho$ must contain matter $\\rho_{\\rm m}$ and radiation $\\rho_{\\rm r}$, which we see\ndirectly, and an as yet poorly understand `dark' energy $\\rho_{\\rm de}$, whose presence\nis required by a broad range of data including the Type Ia supernova Hubble\ndiagram \\cite{32,33}.\n\nHowever, as the measurements of the distance versus redshift continue to improve,\nthey appear to be creating more tension between theory and observations, rather than\nproviding us with a better indication of the dark-energy component, $p_{\\rm de}=\nw_{\\rm de}\\rho_{\\rm de}$. For example, this is seen with the difficulty\n$\\Lambda$CDM has in accounting for the growth and evolution of high-$z$\nquasars \\cite{25} and high-$z$ galaxies \\cite{27}.\nIt is also apparent from the $2.5\\sigma$ disparity between the predictions\nof $\\Lambda$CDM and the precise measurements using the Alcock-Paczynski test\n(${\\cal D}(z) =d_A(z)H(z)/c$) applied to galaxy clusters \\cite{34}.\nOf the 3 measurements made to date, ${\\cal D}(0.35)=0.286\\pm0.025$,\n${\\cal D}(0.57)=0.436\\pm0.052$, and ${\\cal D}(2.34)=1.229\\pm0.110$,\n$\\Lambda$CDM predicts ${\\cal D}^{\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}}(0.35)=0.325$,\n${\\cal D}^{\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}}(0.57)=0.500$, and ${\\cal D}^{\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}}(2.34)\n=1.354$. By contrast, $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ provides a much better accounting of these\ndata, with ${\\cal D}^{R_{\\rm h}=ct}(0.35)=0.300$, ${\\cal D}^{R_{\\rm h}=ct}(0.57)=\n0.451$ and ${\\cal D}^{R_{\\rm h}=ct}(2.34)=1.206$. And as a third example,\nthe best-fit value of $H_0=67.3\\pm1.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ measured by\n{\\it Planck} \\cite{35} is quite different from that ($\\sim 70-72$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) inferred from low-redshift measurements, e.g., using\nthe Type Ia SN Hubble diagram.\n\n$\\Lambda$CDM assumes that dark energy is a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ with\n$w_{\\rm de}\\equiv w_\\Lambda=-1$, and therefore $w=(\\rho_{\\rm r}/3-\\rho_\\Lambda)/\\rho$.\nThis model does quite well explaining many of the observations, but such a scenario\nis inadequate to explain all of the nuances seen in cosmic evolution and the\ngrowth of structure. For example, insofar as the CMB fluctuations measured with\nboth WMAP \\cite{36} and {\\it Planck} \\cite{35} are concerned,\nthere appears to be unresolvable tension between the predicted and measured angular\ncorrelation function \\cite{26,37,38,39}.\nAlso, the observed galaxy distribution function appears to be scale-free,\nwhereas the matter distribution expected in $\\Lambda$CDM has a different form on different\nspatial scales. The fine tuning required to resolve this difference led Watson et al. \\cite{40}\nto characterize the galactic matter distribution function as a `cosmic coincidence.'\n(We note, however, that the galaxy correlation function may be a poor indicator\nof the matter distribution itself, since the former depends on the still uncertain nature\nof galaxy formation, in addition to the underlying cosmology.)  Such difficulties\nare compounded by $\\Lambda$CDM's predicted redshift-age relation,\nwhich does not appear to be consistent with the growth of quasars\nat high redshift \\cite{25}, nor the very early appearance of galaxies at\n$z\\gtrsim 10$ \\cite{27}.\n\nThe $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe is another FRW cosmology that has much in common\nwith $\\Lambda$CDM, but includes an additional ingredient motivated by several\ntheoretical and observational arguments \\cite{15,16,17}. Like $\\Lambda$CDM, \nit also adopts the equation of state\n$p=w\\rho$, with $p=p_{\\rm m}+ p_{\\rm r}+p_{\\rm de}$ and $\\rho=\\rho_{\\rm m}+\n\\rho_{\\rm r}+\\rho_{\\rm de}$, but goes one step further by specifying that\n$w=(\\rho_{\\rm r}/3+ w_{\\rm de}\\rho_{\\rm de})/\\rho=-1/3$ at all times. One might\ncome away with the impression that these two prescriptions for the equation of\nstate cannot be consistent. But in fact nature is telling us that if we ignore the\nconstraint $w=-1/3$ and instead proceed to optimize the parameters in $\\Lambda$CDM by\nfitting the data, the resultant value of $w$ averaged over a Hubble time\nis actually $-1/3$ within the measurement errors \\cite{15,17}.\nIn other words, though $w=(\\rho_{\\rm r}/3-\\rho_\\Lambda)/\\rho$\nin $\\Lambda$CDM cannot be equal to $-1/3$ from one moment to the next, its value averaged\nover the age of the Universe is equal to what it would have been in $R_{\\rm h}=ct$.\n\nThis result does not necessarily prove that $\\Lambda$CDM is an incomplete version of\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$, but it does seem to suggest that the inclusion of the additional\nconstraint $w=-1/3$ might render its predictions closer to the data. In $R_{\\rm h }=ct$,\nthis condition on the total equation of state is required in order to maintain a\nconstant expansion rate $a(t)\\propto t$. Thus, the principal difference between\n$\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ is that, whereas one must first assume the constituents and\ntheir equations of state in $\\Lambda$CDM and then infer its expansion rate, the\nUniverse's dynamics in $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ is completely specified before one begins\nto speculate on its contents.\n\nNonetheless, both $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ face similar limitations\nwhen it comes to the essential ingredients in the cosmic fluid, such as the\nnature of dark matter or dark energy. In $\\Lambda$CDM, one of the most important\nassumptions is that $\\rho_b/\\rho_{d}$ is constant with redshift (and therefore\ntime). Of course, the distribution of halos, and eventually galaxies\nand clusters, depends on the background expansion rate (for a recent\nset of simulations, see ref. \\cite{14}). However, the many calculations\ncarried out to date suggest that the gas mass fraction in clusters is insensitive\nto the underlying cosmology. \n\nThere is actually a good, sound reason for the relative insensitivity \nof the structure and content of a condensing halo to the choice of underlying \ncosmology. One may understand this basic outcome in the context of Birkhoff's \ntheorem and its corollary \\cite{15,19}, according to which the spacetime inside \nof a spherical shell in an otherwise isotropic distribution of mass and energy \nis completely independent of the exterior region. Because of spherical symmetry, \nall contributions to the spacetime curvature within this shell cancel completely. \nThus, once an overdense perturbation in the background density begins to be \nself-gravitating and forms a bound system, its subsequent evolution proceeds \nunder its own gravity, independently of the surrounding medium, even in an \ninfinite universe. The expansion rate exterior to the contracting halo \ntherefore has little influence on the eventual structure and content of \nthe collapsing region. All the simulations confirm this basic result---actually \ngoing even farther and showing that the inclusion of additional \nastrophysical effects, such as radiative cooling, have only a minimal \nimpact on the results.\n\nIn other words, because of Birkhoff's theorem, if $f_{\\rm gas}$ is more \nor less constant in any one model, it is expected to be similarly \nconstant in all cosmological models, but we would measure it to be\nindependent of redshift only if the correct geometry were assumed in\nthe data analysis. This is what makes it such a potentially powerful \nprobe of the cosmology. Insofar as the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe is concerned,\ndetailed hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation do not \nyet exist. But because of Birkhoff's theorem and the insensitivity of\nthe halo evolution to the external expansion rate, we can already\nstart to examine the possibility that $f_{\\rm gas}$ may be constant\nin this cosmology as well, with more in-depth analysis to follow after\ncomprehensive structure formation simulations will have been completed. \n\nNonetheless, to make a model comparison viable, we need to consider\nseveral essential constraints. At the very minimum, the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ \nUniverse must also contain baryonic matter, radiation, dark matter, and \nsome form of dark energy, though we already know that this could not \nbe a cosmological constant. What we do know, however, is that no matter \nwhat these ingredients turn out to be, they must always partition \nthemselves in such a way as to maintain the total equation of state \n$p=-\\rho/3$. The idea that the internal chemisty of a system adjusts \nto macroscopic constraints is not uncommon. For example, we already \nhave such a situation with $\\Lambda$CDM, where the partitioning of \nbaryonic matter and radiation in the early universe follows the prescribed\nredshift evolution in temperature $T(z)$. Moreover, since the existence\nof dark matter and dark energy presumably implies physics beyond the\nstandard model, it's quite possible that this early partitioning\nof the constituents in $\\Lambda$CDM involves other components, in\naddition to baryonic matter and radiation.\n\nRecently, the validity of the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ model was questioned\non the basis that its equation of state could not be consistent with\nthe conservation of matter during the Universe's expansion \\cite{42}.\nThis argument took the opposite approach to what we have just\ndescribed, i.e., it abandoned the equation of state $p=-\\rho/3$\nand instead replaced it with a $\\Lambda$CDM-like sum of the\nequations of state of individual constituents, but with the\nadded proviso that matter could not be created or annihilated\nonce it appeared on the scene. This begs the question of how\nmatter could have been created in the first place, not to mention\nhow such an unmotivated constraint could be consistent with what\nwe believe happened with $\\Lambda$CDM in the early Universe, when\nmatter and radiation (and possibly other as yet unknown fields)\ntransformed back and forth into each other prior to, and subsequent\nto, the period of inflation. It's always interesting to explore \nthe viability of such variants to the basic model, but one should \nnot interpret their results as being meaningful to the \n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe, which does not incorporate the \nconservation of matter as one of its basic ingredients. \nThe only condition essential to this cosmology is the \ntotal equation of state $p=-\\rho/3$, which no doubt will\nimpact how we interpret physics beyond the standard model.\n\nIn our recent analysis of the Epoch of Reionization \\cite{41}, \nwe considered the possibility that the dark matter and baryonic \ndensities might have evolved separately of each other at high \nredshifts, i.e., $6\\lesssim z\\lesssim 15$. However, it is not\nclear whether such a trend might continue to lower redshifts.\nThere is clearly much to learn from future developments in\nparticle physics, for both $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$. But\ninsofar as understanding the redshift dependence of the gas mass\nfraction $f_{\\rm gas}$ is concerned, we will here make the\nsimplest minimal assumption for both $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ and $\\Lambda$CDM, \nwhich is that the baryonic fraction $\\rho_b/\\rho_{d}$ remains \napproximately constant for $z\\lesssim 2$. The results of this paper \nare contingent upon the validity of this assumption.\n\n\\section{The Principal Data Sets}\nIn order to compare the predictions of the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe against\nthose of the reference $\\Lambda$CDM model, we consider three samples\nof galaxy clusters whose gas mass fractions have been measured using\nX-ray surface brightness observations. The LaRoque et al. sample \\cite{1}\nconsists of 38 massive clusters lying in the redshift range $0.14<z<0.89$,\nand were obtained from {\\it Chandra} X-ray and OVRO/BIMA interferometric\nSunyaev-Zeldovich Effect measurements. In order to study the\ndependence of their analysis on the assumed model for the cluster gas\ndistribution, taking into account the possible presence of a cooling flow,\nthese authors considered three different models for the plasma\nprofile: (1) an isothermal $\\beta$-model fit jointly to the X-ray data\nat radii beyond 100 kpc and to all of the SZE data, (2) a nonisothermal\ndouble $\\beta$-model in hydrostatic equilibrium, fit jointly to all of the\nX-ray and SZE data, and (3) an isothermal $\\beta$-model fit only to\nthe SZE spatial data. In this paper, we consider the results of models\n(1) and (2) only, since the number of clusters appropriate for the third\ncase was noticeably smaller than the others. The single isothermal\n$\\beta$-model with the central 100 kpc excised seemed to work\nquite well, since the cut was large enough to exclude the\ncooling region in cool-core clusters while keeping a sufficient\nnumber of photons to enable the mass modelling. The  more\nsophisticated double-$\\beta$ model was designed to take into\naccount (non-isothermal) temperature profiles, and was\ndeveloped to assess the biases arising from the isothermal\nassumption and the effects of core exclusion in the first\nmodel. As we will see in the next section, the fits suggest\nthat both of these approaches work quite well, and provide\nmutually consistent results.\n\nOur second sample is taken from Allen et al. \\cite{2}, who compiled a catalog\nof 42 hot ($kT_e>5$ keV), X-ray luminous, dynamically relaxed galaxy\nclusters spanning the redshift range $0.05<z<1.1$. Their measurements\nwere also based on {\\it Chandra} observations, and like ref. \\cite{1},\nthese authors also adopted a canonical measurement radius of $r_{2,500}$,\nwhose value they determined directly from the {\\it Chandra} data. Ten\nof these clusters are in common with a subset of the LaRoque sample,\nand there is good agreement for the best-fitting results in this sub-sample\nat $r_{2,500}$ between the two groups, though the mass fractions\nmeasured by LaRoque et al. are on average about $6$ percent\nhigher than those reported in ref. \\cite{1} for the systems\nin common.\n\nThe Ettori et al. \\cite{3} sample is the biggest of the three, containing\n52 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters (also observed with {\\it Chandra})\nin the redshift range $0.3<z<1.273$, merged with 8 additional objects\nat $0.06<z<0.23$, with a gas temperature $>4$ keV \\cite{30}.\nNote, however, that\nalthough the reference cosmology (as described in \\S1 above)\nis identical for all three samples, ref. \\cite{3} decided to use\nan overdensity of 500 (instead of 2,500) to define the outer radius of\ntheir mass determination region. Strictly speaking, this means that\n$\\eta$ (see Equation~2.13) could be different from the value ($\\sim 0.2$)\napplied to the other two samples, but for the sake of simplicity, we\nwill use the same value throughout our analysis. Since this index\nis presumably much smaller than one, the impact of\nthis approximation on our results is expected to be smaller than,\ne.g., the errors on the sample means of the $f_{\\rm gas}$ values.\nAnother technical difference among the samples is that both the\nAllen et al. \\cite{2} and Ettori et al. \\cite{3} measurements of the\nmass fraction $f_{\\rm gas}$ are based strictly on the assumption\nof isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium, in constrast to \nref. \\cite{1}, which considered both isothermal and nonisothermal \nmodels.  Such differences in the handling of the various samples\nprecludes any possibility of merging them into a single, bigger sample,\nthereby improving the statistics. On the other hand, the fact that\nthe approaches were somewhat different lends some credence to the\nresults when they agree with each other within the errors.\n\n\\section{A Direct Comparison between $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$}\nNon-radiative simulations of large clusters suggest that $f_{\\rm gas}$ should\nbe approximately constant with redshift \\cite{4,5,14}, at least for $z\\lesssim 2$.\nLet us now compare the measured values of $f_{\\rm gas}$, based on the\nreference $\\Lambda$CDM model, with those re-calibrated for the\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe using Equation~(2.13). For each sample, we calculate\nthe $\\chi^2$ function,\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 18907, "prevtext": "\nat its inferred redshift $z_{\\rm cluster}$. Often, $\\Delta$ is taken to be\n2,500 (as in refs. \\cite{1,2}; see next section),\nbut not always. (This is one of several reasons why we cannot combine\nall of the available samples to carry out a single fitting procedure. As we shall see\nin the next section, it is necessary to carry out the fitting for each individual\ncompilation of sources. Some discussion concerning which value is more trustworthy in\nmeasuring $f_{\\rm gas}$ appears in refs. \\cite{30,31}.)\nThe third data set we are using \\cite{3} assumes $\\Delta=500$.\n\nSo there is an additional dependence of $f_{\\rm gas}$ on the background\ncosmology, beyond simply the factor appearing in Equation~(2.9), because\n$r_{2,500}$ (or $r_{500}$) itself changes with the model. The reasoning\nbehind this is rather simple to understand \\cite{2}. On the one hand,\nwe know that the total mass within $r_{2,500}$ is given by the expression\n$M_{2,500}=(4\\pi/3)r_{2,500}^3(2,500\\,\\rho_c)$. But since both $T_e$\nand the density gradient in Equation~(2.7) are approximately constant in\nthe region of $\\theta_{2,500}$, the hydrostatic equilibrium equation\ngives $M_{2,500}\\propto r_{2,500}$ (see Equation~2.8). These two\nexpressions should be equal, and since $\\rho_c\\sim H(z)^2$, we see\nthat $r_{2,500}\\sim H(z)^{-1}$. Thus, the angle spanned by $r_{2,500}$\nat $z$ is $\\theta_{2,500}=r_{2,500}/d_A\\sim (H\\,d_A)^{-1}$. According\nto ref. \\cite{2}, the slope of $f_{\\rm gas}(r/r_{2,500})$ in the\nregion of $r_{2,500}$ is $\\eta\\sim 0.214\\pm0.022$ over their\nsample range $0.7<r/r_{2,500}<1.2$, for the reference $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel described in the introduction. Therefore, since the angle\nsubtended by $r_{2,500}$ changes with the cosmology, one\nexpects that $f_{\\rm gas}\\sim \\theta_{2,500}^{-\\eta}\\sim\n(H\\,d_A)^\\eta$, over and above the primary dependence given\nin Equation~(2.9). This angular correction factor is close to unity\nfor all cosmologies and redshifts of interest, but ought to be included\nfor completeness.\n\nGiven the strong dependence of the inferred values of $M_{\\rm gas}$\nand $M_{\\rm tot}$ on the assumed cosmology, the\ndata need to be recalibrated for each considered model.  However,\na procedure has been developed by the groups who analyze these\nclusters, in which the data are reduced once for the reference\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, and then are fitted with modifications\nto the reference model based on its differences with the cosmology\nbeing tested.

This effect was\nalso found previously by ref. \\cite{44} using supernova data.\n\nBut the process of selecting the most likely correct model also takes into\naccount the number of free parameters. The likelikhood of either\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ or $\\Lambda$CDM being closer to the ``true\" model may\nbe determined from the model selection criteria discussed extensively in\nref. \\cite{23}. A commonly used criterion\nin cosmology is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) \\cite{45,46,47},\nwhich prefers models with few parameters to those\nwith many, unless the latter provide a substantially better fit to the data.\nThis avoids the possibility that by using a greater number of parameters, one\nmay simply be fitting the noise.\n\nThe AIC is given by ${\\rm AIC} = \\chi^2 + 2\\,k$,\nwhere $k$ is the number of free parameters. Among two models $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and\n$\\mathcal{M}_2$ fitted to the data, the one with the least resulting AIC is assessed as the\none more likely to be ``true.''  If ${\\rm AIC}_i$ comes from model~$\\mathcal{M}_i$, the\nunnormalized confidence that $\\mathcal{M}_i$~is true is the ``Akaike\nweight'' $\\exp(-{\\rm AIC}_i/2)$.

Sometimes, additional \nfactors are added to this expression, e.g., representing the possible contribution \nfrom nonthermal pressure support, the $z$ dependence of the baryonic mass fraction \nin stars, and a possible evolutionary depletion of the baryon fraction measured at\n$r_{2,500}$ as a consequence of the thermodynamic history of the gas \\cite{2}. \nAll these factors, however, appear to be very close to unity, and we will \ntherefore not include them in our analysis.\n\n\\section{Theoretical Background}\nThe appropriate spacetime to use in any cosmological model is conveniently and\nelegantly written in terms of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, though\nthis does not tell us much about the cosmic equation of state (EOS), relating the total\nenergy density $\\rho$ to its total pressure $p$. If the EOS were known,\nthe dynamical equations governing the Universal expansion could be solved exactly,\nand the observations could then be interpreted unambiguously. Unfortunately, we\nmust rely on measurements and assumptions to pick $\\rho$ and $p$. At the very minimum,\n$\\rho$ must contain matter $\\rho_{\\rm m}$ and radiation $\\rho_{\\rm r}$, which we see\ndirectly, and an as yet poorly understand `dark' energy $\\rho_{\\rm de}$, whose presence\nis required by a broad range of data including the Type Ia supernova Hubble\ndiagram \\cite{32,33}.\n\nHowever, as the measurements of the distance versus redshift continue to improve,\nthey appear to be creating more tension between theory and observations, rather than\nproviding us with a better indication of the dark-energy component, $p_{\\rm de}=\nw_{\\rm de}\\rho_{\\rm de}$. For example, this is seen with the difficulty\n$\\Lambda$CDM has in accounting for the growth and evolution of high-$z$\nquasars \\cite{25} and high-$z$ galaxies \\cite{27}.\nIt is also apparent from the $2.5\\sigma$ disparity between the predictions\nof $\\Lambda$CDM and the precise measurements using the Alcock-Paczynski test\n(${\\cal D}(z) =d_A(z)H(z)/c$) applied to galaxy clusters \\cite{34}.\nOf the 3 measurements made to date, ${\\cal D}(0.35)=0.286\\pm0.025$,\n${\\cal D}(0.57)=0.436\\pm0.052$, and ${\\cal D}(2.34)=1.229\\pm0.110$,\n$\\Lambda$CDM predicts ${\\cal D}^{\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}}(0.35)=0.325$,\n${\\cal D}^{\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}}(0.57)=0.500$, and ${\\cal D}^{\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}}(2.34)\n=1.354$. By contrast, $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ provides a much better accounting of these\ndata, with ${\\cal D}^{R_{\\rm h}=ct}(0.35)=0.300$, ${\\cal D}^{R_{\\rm h}=ct}(0.57)=\n0.451$ and ${\\cal D}^{R_{\\rm h}=ct}(2.34)=1.206$. And as a third example,\nthe best-fit value of $H_0=67.3\\pm1.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ measured by\n{\\it Planck} \\cite{35} is quite different from that ($\\sim 70-72$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) inferred from low-redshift measurements, e.g., using\nthe Type Ia SN Hubble diagram.\n\n$\\Lambda$CDM assumes that dark energy is a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ with\n$w_{\\rm de}\\equiv w_\\Lambda=-1$, and therefore $w=(\\rho_{\\rm r}/3-\\rho_\\Lambda)/\\rho$.\nThis model does quite well explaining many of the observations, but such a scenario\nis inadequate to explain all of the nuances seen in cosmic evolution and the\ngrowth of structure. For example, insofar as the CMB fluctuations measured with\nboth WMAP \\cite{36} and {\\it Planck} \\cite{35} are concerned,\nthere appears to be unresolvable tension between the predicted and measured angular\ncorrelation function \\cite{26,37,38,39}.\nAlso, the observed galaxy distribution function appears to be scale-free,\nwhereas the matter distribution expected in $\\Lambda$CDM has a different form on different\nspatial scales. The fine tuning required to resolve this difference led Watson et al. \\cite{40}\nto characterize the galactic matter distribution function as a `cosmic coincidence.'\n(We note, however, that the galaxy correlation function may be a poor indicator\nof the matter distribution itself, since the former depends on the still uncertain nature\nof galaxy formation, in addition to the underlying cosmology.)  Such difficulties\nare compounded by $\\Lambda$CDM's predicted redshift-age relation,\nwhich does not appear to be consistent with the growth of quasars\nat high redshift \\cite{25}, nor the very early appearance of galaxies at\n$z\\gtrsim 10$ \\cite{27}.\n\nThe $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe is another FRW cosmology that has much in common\nwith $\\Lambda$CDM, but includes an additional ingredient motivated by several\ntheoretical and observational arguments \\cite{15,16,17}. Like $\\Lambda$CDM, \nit also adopts the equation of state\n$p=w\\rho$, with $p=p_{\\rm m}+ p_{\\rm r}+p_{\\rm de}$ and $\\rho=\\rho_{\\rm m}+\n\\rho_{\\rm r}+\\rho_{\\rm de}$, but goes one step further by specifying that\n$w=(\\rho_{\\rm r}/3+ w_{\\rm de}\\rho_{\\rm de})/\\rho=-1/3$ at all times. One might\ncome away with the impression that these two prescriptions for the equation of\nstate cannot be consistent. But in fact nature is telling us that if we ignore the\nconstraint $w=-1/3$ and instead proceed to optimize the parameters in $\\Lambda$CDM by\nfitting the data, the resultant value of $w$ averaged over a Hubble time\nis actually $-1/3$ within the measurement errors \\cite{15,17}.\nIn other words, though $w=(\\rho_{\\rm r}/3-\\rho_\\Lambda)/\\rho$\nin $\\Lambda$CDM cannot be equal to $-1/3$ from one moment to the next, its value averaged\nover the age of the Universe is equal to what it would have been in $R_{\\rm h}=ct$.\n\nThis result does not necessarily prove that $\\Lambda$CDM is an incomplete version of\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$, but it does seem to suggest that the inclusion of the additional\nconstraint $w=-1/3$ might render its predictions closer to the data. In $R_{\\rm h }=ct$,\nthis condition on the total equation of state is required in order to maintain a\nconstant expansion rate $a(t)\\propto t$. Thus, the principal difference between\n$\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ is that, whereas one must first assume the constituents and\ntheir equations of state in $\\Lambda$CDM and then infer its expansion rate, the\nUniverse's dynamics in $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ is completely specified before one begins\nto speculate on its contents.\n\nNonetheless, both $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ face similar limitations\nwhen it comes to the essential ingredients in the cosmic fluid, such as the\nnature of dark matter or dark energy. In $\\Lambda$CDM, one of the most important\nassumptions is that $\\rho_b/\\rho_{d}$ is constant with redshift (and therefore\ntime). Of course, the distribution of halos, and eventually galaxies\nand clusters, depends on the background expansion rate (for a recent\nset of simulations, see ref. \\cite{14}). However, the many calculations\ncarried out to date suggest that the gas mass fraction in clusters is insensitive\nto the underlying cosmology. \n\nThere is actually a good, sound reason for the relative insensitivity \nof the structure and content of a condensing halo to the choice of underlying \ncosmology. One may understand this basic outcome in the context of Birkhoff's \ntheorem and its corollary \\cite{15,19}, according to which the spacetime inside \nof a spherical shell in an otherwise isotropic distribution of mass and energy \nis completely independent of the exterior region. Because of spherical symmetry, \nall contributions to the spacetime curvature within this shell cancel completely. \nThus, once an overdense perturbation in the background density begins to be \nself-gravitating and forms a bound system, its subsequent evolution proceeds \nunder its own gravity, independently of the surrounding medium, even in an \ninfinite universe. The expansion rate exterior to the contracting halo \ntherefore has little influence on the eventual structure and content of \nthe collapsing region. All the simulations confirm this basic result---actually \ngoing even farther and showing that the inclusion of additional \nastrophysical effects, such as radiative cooling, have only a minimal \nimpact on the results.\n\nIn other words, because of Birkhoff's theorem, if $f_{\\rm gas}$ is more \nor less constant in any one model, it is expected to be similarly \nconstant in all cosmological models, but we would measure it to be\nindependent of redshift only if the correct geometry were assumed in\nthe data analysis. This is what makes it such a potentially powerful \nprobe of the cosmology. Insofar as the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe is concerned,\ndetailed hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation do not \nyet exist. But because of Birkhoff's theorem and the insensitivity of\nthe halo evolution to the external expansion rate, we can already\nstart to examine the possibility that $f_{\\rm gas}$ may be constant\nin this cosmology as well, with more in-depth analysis to follow after\ncomprehensive structure formation simulations will have been completed. \n\nNonetheless, to make a model comparison viable, we need to consider\nseveral essential constraints. At the very minimum, the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ \nUniverse must also contain baryonic matter, radiation, dark matter, and \nsome form of dark energy, though we already know that this could not \nbe a cosmological constant. What we do know, however, is that no matter \nwhat these ingredients turn out to be, they must always partition \nthemselves in such a way as to maintain the total equation of state \n$p=-\\rho/3$. The idea that the internal chemisty of a system adjusts \nto macroscopic constraints is not uncommon. For example, we already \nhave such a situation with $\\Lambda$CDM, where the partitioning of \nbaryonic matter and radiation in the early universe follows the prescribed\nredshift evolution in temperature $T(z)$. Moreover, since the existence\nof dark matter and dark energy presumably implies physics beyond the\nstandard model, it's quite possible that this early partitioning\nof the constituents in $\\Lambda$CDM involves other components, in\naddition to baryonic matter and radiation.\n\nRecently, the validity of the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ model was questioned\non the basis that its equation of state could not be consistent with\nthe conservation of matter during the Universe's expansion \\cite{42}.\nThis argument took the opposite approach to what we have just\ndescribed, i.e., it abandoned the equation of state $p=-\\rho/3$\nand instead replaced it with a $\\Lambda$CDM-like sum of the\nequations of state of individual constituents, but with the\nadded proviso that matter could not be created or annihilated\nonce it appeared on the scene. This begs the question of how\nmatter could have been created in the first place, not to mention\nhow such an unmotivated constraint could be consistent with what\nwe believe happened with $\\Lambda$CDM in the early Universe, when\nmatter and radiation (and possibly other as yet unknown fields)\ntransformed back and forth into each other prior to, and subsequent\nto, the period of inflation. It's always interesting to explore \nthe viability of such variants to the basic model, but one should \nnot interpret their results as being meaningful to the \n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe, which does not incorporate the \nconservation of matter as one of its basic ingredients. \nThe only condition essential to this cosmology is the \ntotal equation of state $p=-\\rho/3$, which no doubt will\nimpact how we interpret physics beyond the standard model.\n\nIn our recent analysis of the Epoch of Reionization \\cite{41}, \nwe considered the possibility that the dark matter and baryonic \ndensities might have evolved separately of each other at high \nredshifts, i.e., $6\\lesssim z\\lesssim 15$. However, it is not\nclear whether such a trend might continue to lower redshifts.\nThere is clearly much to learn from future developments in\nparticle physics, for both $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$. But\ninsofar as understanding the redshift dependence of the gas mass\nfraction $f_{\\rm gas}$ is concerned, we will here make the\nsimplest minimal assumption for both $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ and $\\Lambda$CDM, \nwhich is that the baryonic fraction $\\rho_b/\\rho_{d}$ remains \napproximately constant for $z\\lesssim 2$. The results of this paper \nare contingent upon the validity of this assumption.\n\n\\section{The Principal Data Sets}\nIn order to compare the predictions of the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe against\nthose of the reference $\\Lambda$CDM model, we consider three samples\nof galaxy clusters whose gas mass fractions have been measured using\nX-ray surface brightness observations. The LaRoque et al. sample \\cite{1}\nconsists of 38 massive clusters lying in the redshift range $0.14<z<0.89$,\nand were obtained from {\\it Chandra} X-ray and OVRO/BIMA interferometric\nSunyaev-Zeldovich Effect measurements. In order to study the\ndependence of their analysis on the assumed model for the cluster gas\ndistribution, taking into account the possible presence of a cooling flow,\nthese authors considered three different models for the plasma\nprofile: (1) an isothermal $\\beta$-model fit jointly to the X-ray data\nat radii beyond 100 kpc and to all of the SZE data, (2) a nonisothermal\ndouble $\\beta$-model in hydrostatic equilibrium, fit jointly to all of the\nX-ray and SZE data, and (3) an isothermal $\\beta$-model fit only to\nthe SZE spatial data. In this paper, we consider the results of models\n(1) and (2) only, since the number of clusters appropriate for the third\ncase was noticeably smaller than the others. The single isothermal\n$\\beta$-model with the central 100 kpc excised seemed to work\nquite well, since the cut was large enough to exclude the\ncooling region in cool-core clusters while keeping a sufficient\nnumber of photons to enable the mass modelling. The  more\nsophisticated double-$\\beta$ model was designed to take into\naccount (non-isothermal) temperature profiles, and was\ndeveloped to assess the biases arising from the isothermal\nassumption and the effects of core exclusion in the first\nmodel. As we will see in the next section, the fits suggest\nthat both of these approaches work quite well, and provide\nmutually consistent results.\n\nOur second sample is taken from Allen et al. \\cite{2}, who compiled a catalog\nof 42 hot ($kT_e>5$ keV), X-ray luminous, dynamically relaxed galaxy\nclusters spanning the redshift range $0.05<z<1.1$. Their measurements\nwere also based on {\\it Chandra} observations, and like ref. \\cite{1},\nthese authors also adopted a canonical measurement radius of $r_{2,500}$,\nwhose value they determined directly from the {\\it Chandra} data. Ten\nof these clusters are in common with a subset of the LaRoque sample,\nand there is good agreement for the best-fitting results in this sub-sample\nat $r_{2,500}$ between the two groups, though the mass fractions\nmeasured by LaRoque et al. are on average about $6$ percent\nhigher than those reported in ref. \\cite{1} for the systems\nin common.\n\nThe Ettori et al. \\cite{3} sample is the biggest of the three, containing\n52 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters (also observed with {\\it Chandra})\nin the redshift range $0.3<z<1.273$, merged with 8 additional objects\nat $0.06<z<0.23$, with a gas temperature $>4$ keV \\cite{30}.\nNote, however, that\nalthough the reference cosmology (as described in \\S1 above)\nis identical for all three samples, ref. \\cite{3} decided to use\nan overdensity of 500 (instead of 2,500) to define the outer radius of\ntheir mass determination region. Strictly speaking, this means that\n$\\eta$ (see Equation~2.13) could be different from the value ($\\sim 0.2$)\napplied to the other two samples, but for the sake of simplicity, we\nwill use the same value throughout our analysis. Since this index\nis presumably much smaller than one, the impact of\nthis approximation on our results is expected to be smaller than,\ne.g., the errors on the sample means of the $f_{\\rm gas}$ values.\nAnother technical difference among the samples is that both the\nAllen et al. \\cite{2} and Ettori et al. \\cite{3} measurements of the\nmass fraction $f_{\\rm gas}$ are based strictly on the assumption\nof isothermality and hydrostatic equilibrium, in constrast to \nref. \\cite{1}, which considered both isothermal and nonisothermal \nmodels.  Such differences in the handling of the various samples\nprecludes any possibility of merging them into a single, bigger sample,\nthereby improving the statistics. On the other hand, the fact that\nthe approaches were somewhat different lends some credence to the\nresults when they agree with each other within the errors.\n\n\\section{A Direct Comparison between $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$}\nNon-radiative simulations of large clusters suggest that $f_{\\rm gas}$ should\nbe approximately constant with redshift \\cite{4,5,14}, at least for $z\\lesssim 2$.\nLet us now compare the measured values of $f_{\\rm gas}$, based on the\nreference $\\Lambda$CDM model, with those re-calibrated for the\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe using Equation~(2.13).

The point of\nlisting all three criteria is not so much to dwell on which of these may or\nmay not reflect the importance of free parameters but, rather, to demonstrate\nthat there is general agreement among them---the most commonly used\nmodel-selection tools in the literature---that the cluster gas mass fraction\ndata favor the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe over $\\Lambda$CDM.\nIn the case of BIC, considered to be the\nmost reliable among them \\cite{45,46}, the\ndifference in likelihoods is overwhelming ($\\sim 95\\%$ to $\\sim 5\\%$).\nThis effect is considered to be `strong' when using these\ncriteria. Note also that, in spite of the fact that the Ettori et al.\n\\cite{3} sample uses a different over-density ratio $\\Delta$ than those\nof refs. \\cite{1,2}, the likelihood\ncomparisons in Table 1 are all quite similar and consistent with each other.\nThis may be a fortuitous result because simulations have shown that the baryon\nfraction in clusters can vary depending on the level of concentration towards\nthe core, as a result of several astrophysical effects, including radiative\ncooling and feedback from winds (see also ref. \\cite{50}).\nIt appears that the level of measurement\nprecision we have currently is not sufficient to discern between these\ntwo values of $\\Delta$. However, the fact that theory predicts some change\nin $f_{\\rm gas}$ with spatial scale suggests that future observations may\nneed to be interpreted more carefully when the baryon fraction is used to\ndo cosmological model comparisons.\n\n\\begin{table*}[h]\n\\center\n\\centerline{Table 1.

At best, $\\Lambda$CDM may do as well as $R_{\\rm h}=ct$\nin accounting for some of the data, though at a cost---the need to\ninclude a larger number of free parameters. But in some cases,\nsuch as the cosmic chronometers, the $\\chi^2$ of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nfit is inferior to that of $R_{\\rm h }=ct$, even though the former\nhas a larger number of unrestricted variables.\n\nInsofar as the use of cluster gas mass fractions to probe the cosmological\nexpansion is concerned, there is considerable room for improvement beyond\nthe current situation. For example, as the precision of the observations\ncontinues to improve, and as the hydrodynamic simulations gain in sophistication \nand complexity, it is becoming more apparent that the adoption of a purely \nconstant fraction $f_{\\rm gas}$ may be an over-simplification. This ratio \napparently changes with radius in any given cluster and, worse, may not be \nuniformly constant (as evidenced in part by the observed scatter) across \na chosen sample (see, e.g., refs~\\cite{52,53}). At the very minimum,\nthese effects call into question the use of different $\\Delta$'s to \ncalculate $f_{\\rm gas}$. Part of the difficulty is that the best \nspatially-resolved data are not fully consistent with the assumption \nof hydrostatic equilibrium, which was used to infer the mass \nof the X-ray emitting plasma. Recently, substantial progress\nhas been made with cluster observations, driven by weak gravitational\nlensing, which does not depend on the dynamical state of the cluster\n\\cite{52,53}. Such joint X-ray and weak-lensing studies, encompassing\nthe mass distribution out to the virial radius \\cite{52} and\n$r_{500}$ \\cite{53}, clearly show a pronounced radial dependence\nin the value of $f_{\\rm gas}$ inferred from both weak-lensing\nand the ratio of hydrostatic equilibrium mass to weak-lensing\nmass. \n\nIronically, the best-fit mean gas fractions that we have derived here\n(for both $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm h}=ct$) are comparable for the two\nvalues of $\\Delta$ used in the samples adopted in this paper, in spite\nof the expected radial dependence in $f_{\\rm gas}$. It appears that\nthese two effects, i.e., the radial dependence of $f_{\\rm gas}$ and\nthe apparent breakdown of hydrostatic equilibrium, largely offset\neach other, producing an almost constant mass fraction between\n$\\Delta=500$ and $\\Delta=2,500$. Nonetheless, the model comparison \nwe have carried out here will benefit considerably from the much \nmore detailed and better spatially-resolved measurements that will\nbe made in the near future along the lines reported in refs.~\\cite{52,53}.\n\nIn the long run, one would like to match the capabilities of techniques \nusing Type Ia SNe, cluster number counts, weak lensing and BAO to study\nthe possible redshift dependence of $f_{\\rm gas}$ and its implication for\ncosmology. But in order to do this, one would need to measure $f_{\\rm gas}$ \nto $\\sim 5\\%$ accuracy for large samples (i.e., $> 500$) of hot, massive \nclusters ($kT_e> 5$ keV), spanning the redshift range $0<z<2$ \\cite{51}.\nThough the Constellation-X Observatory and {\\it XEUS}, for which these \nestimates were first developed, are no longer viable future missions, \nthey have evolved into another possible project, known as The Advanced \nTelescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA), which could contribute\nto the resources necessary to carry out the required observations, if it \never reaches maturity.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nI am very grateful to Amherst College for its support through a John Woodruff\nSimpson Lectureship, and to ISSI in Bern where some of this work was carried out.\n\n\\vskip 0.2in\\noindent{\\bf Ethics Statement.} This research poses no ethical considerations.\n\n\\vskip 0.2in\\noindent{\\bf Data Accessibility Statement.} All data used in this paper were\npreviously published, as indicated in Table 1.\n\n\\vskip 0.2in\\noindent{\\bf Competing Interests Statement.} We have no competing interests.\n\n\\vskip 0.2in\\noindent{\\bf Authors' contributions.} FM is the sole author of this paper.\n\n\\vskip 0.2in\\noindent{\\bf Funding.} Partial support for this work was provided by\nthe International Space Science Institute in Bern, Switzerland.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\n\n\\bibitem{1} LaRoque SJ Bonamente M Carlstrom JE Joy MK Nagal D Reese ED and Dawson KS.\n2006.

Here, we conservatively take the minimum number, i.e., 2, these\nbeing the value of $\\Omega_m$ and $w_\\Lambda$, the two parameters (besides\n$H_0$) used to calculate $f_{\\rm gas}$ in the three samples.\n\nTo facilitate a quick visual comparison between the various models, we show in\nfigures~1-3 the data obtained for the reference $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology,\npaired with the same set of data re-calibrated for the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe. As\ndescribed above, this re-calibration is not necessary to produce the fits and\ntheir $\\chi^2$ values, and is carried out solely for the purpose of yielding an\nimmediate visual impact of the differences between the two.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{fig2.eps}\n\\caption{The apparent variation of the X-ray gas mass fraction measured within\n$r_{2500}$ as a function of redshift for the 42 clusters in Allen et al. \\cite{2}.

In these figures, the data include both cool-core\n(triangles) and non-cool-core subsamples (squares). This sample includes a\nsubgroup of clusters with bright and sharply peaked cores; they are referred\nto as cool-core clusters because the sharply peaked X-ray emission is indicative\nof strong radiative cooling in cluster core. The individual values of $f_{\\rm gas}$\nand $\\chi^2_{\\rm dof}$ are quoted in the figure captions, and range over\n$f_{\\rm gas}\\sim 0.108\\pm0.020$ to $0.120\\pm0.032$ with $\\chi^2_{\\rm dof}\\sim\n0.59-0.88$ for the reference $\\Lambda$CDM model, and $f_{\\rm gas}\n\\sim 0.114\\pm0.021$ to $0.124\\pm0.022$ with $\\chi^2_{\\rm dof}\\sim\n0.57-0.86$ for the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe.\n\n\\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\nThe results presented in the previous section demonstrate that both\nthe reference $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology and the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$\nUniverse are consistent with a constant value of the cluster gas mass\nfraction with increasing redshift, under the underlying assumption\nthat the baryonic fraction $\\rho_b/\\rho_d$ has remained constant\nduring the most significant period of structure formation (i.e.,\n$z\\lesssim 3-4$).\n\nThe fact that the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ Universe fits these data so well\nis probably the reason why some previous work with clusters had already\nhinted at a possible deviation from accelerated expansion, even though\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ was not known or used in those studies \\cite{43}.\nUsing the 42 measurements from ref. \\cite{2}, these authors concluded\nthat cosmic acceleration in the context of $\\Lambda$CDM could have already\npeaked and that we might be witnessing a slowing down. This effect was\nalso found previously by ref. \\cite{44} using supernova data.\n\nBut the process of selecting the most likely correct model also takes into\naccount the number of free parameters. The likelikhood of either\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$ or $\\Lambda$CDM being closer to the ``true\" model may\nbe determined from the model selection criteria discussed extensively in\nref. \\cite{23}. A commonly used criterion\nin cosmology is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) \\cite{45,46,47},\nwhich prefers models with few parameters to those\nwith many, unless the latter provide a substantially better fit to the data.\nThis avoids the possibility that by using a greater number of parameters, one\nmay simply be fitting the noise.\n\nThe AIC is given by ${\\rm AIC} = \\chi^2 + 2\\,k$,\nwhere $k$ is the number of free parameters. Among two models $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and\n$\\mathcal{M}_2$ fitted to the data, the one with the least resulting AIC is assessed as the\none more likely to be ``true.''  If ${\\rm AIC}_i$ comes from model~$\\mathcal{M}_i$, the\nunnormalized confidence that $\\mathcal{M}_i$~is true is the ``Akaike\nweight'' $\\exp(-{\\rm AIC}_i/2)$.
