We can verify this and\nquantify the potential contribution to the ALMA flux densities from\nAGN activity by taking the {\\it Spitzer} 24~$\\mu$m constraints of our\nsources and predicting the 870~$\\mu$m flux density. All of our X-ray\nAGNs and ALMA sources have a 24~$\\mu$m flux density of $S_{\\rm\n  24~{\\mu}m}<100$~$\\mu$Jy, with the exception of AGN~1 which has\n$S_{\\rm 24~{\\mu}m}=450\\pm10$~$\\mu$Jy (e.g.,\\ Webb et~al. 2009; Colbert\net~al. 2011; Capak et~al. 2013). On the basis of the mean empirical\nAGN spectral energy distribution (SED) template of Mullaney\net~al. (2011), a 24~$\\mu$m flux density of 100~$\\mu$Jy would\ncorrespond to a 870~$\\mu$m flux density of only 35~$\\mu$Jy at\n$z=3.09$. Conservatively assuming that the 24~$\\mu$m emission is\ndominated by AGN activity rather than star formation, we therefore\npredict that the AGN contributes to $\\approx$~9\\% of the 870~$\\mu$m\nflux density for AGN~1 and contributes to ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~4\\% for all of the\nother sources. We therefore expect our 870~$\\mu$m flux densities to\nprovide a reliable measurement of the star-formation luminosities of\nour sources.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sec:SMMJ1237}\n\nOverall we detected six sources at 870~$\\mu$m within the primary beam\nof the eight ALMA maps: three of the eight X-ray AGNs have ALMA\ncounterparts, all of the four LABs have an ALMA counterpart within the\nextent of the Ly~$\\alpha$ emission (two of which are directly matched\nwith an X-ray AGN and two of which are offset from the X-ray AGN but\nare likely to be physically associated with the LAB), and one ALMA\nsource appears to be a galaxy in a merger with an X-ray AGN. In the\nfollowing sub sections we compare the SFRs of the X-ray AGNs in the\nprotocluster to the SFRs of distant X-ray AGNs in the field (see\n\\S3.1) and investigate the SFRs of the protocluster LABs (see \\S3.2).\n\n\\subsection{The star-formation properties of X-ray detected AGNs in a distant protocluster}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[width=10.5cm,angle=0]{dalexander_fig3.eps}\n\\caption{Infrared luminosity from star formation versus redshift for\n  the X-ray detected AGNs in the SSA~22 protocluster compared with\n  X-ray detected AGNs in the field (open triangles; taken from\n  Mullaney et~al. 2015); see Fig.~1 for the other symbol\n  descriptions. The conversion from $L_{\\rm IR}$ to SFR is calculated\n  using Eqn.~1. The shaded regions indicate the range in mean infrared\n  luminosities for the protocluster AGNs at $z\\approx$~3.09 and for\n  the AGNs in the field at two mean redshifts; the redshift ranges are\n  indicated by the grey horizontal lines.

There is\n  significant scatter in the infrared luminosities for individual\n  X-ray AGNs; however, the mean infrared luminosities are consistent\n  with $M_{*}$ star-forming galaxies at the average redshifts for both\n  the protocluster and field AGN samples.}\n\\label{fig:N24_onedspec}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nMany previous studies have explored the SFRs of distant X-ray AGNs in\nthe field (e.g.,\\ Shao et~al. 2010; Harrison et~al. 2012; Mullaney\net~al. 2012; Rosario et~al. 2012, 2013; Santini et~al. 2012; Stanley\net~al. 2015). However, little is known about the SFRs of X-ray AGNs in\na distant protocluster environment. The previous studies of field AGNs\nhave found that both the mean SFR and the evolution in SFR with\nredshift are consistent with those of co-eval massive\n($\\approx$~$M_{*}$) star-forming galaxies (e.g.,\\ Mullaney\net~al. 2012; Santini et~al. 2012; Hickox et~al. 2014; Stanley\net~al. 2015); for example, the mean SFRs of X-ray AGNs at\n$z\\approx$~2.0--2.5 are $\\approx$~10 times higher than those of X-ray\nAGNs at $z\\approx$~0.5--1.0. On average, distant X-ray AGNs therefore\nappear to reside in typical star-forming galaxies, although we caution\nthat there can be a broad spread of individual SFR values\n(e.g.,\\ Mullaney et~al. 2015).\n\nIn our analyses we compare the SFRs of X-ray AGNs in the protocluster\nand field, utilising the study of Mullaney et~al. (2015), which\nprimarily used ALMA 870~$\\mu$m data to measure SFRs for $z>1.5$ X-ray\nAGNs in the field. The field AGNs extend to lower X-ray luminosities\nthan the protocluster AGNs, as expected due to the deeper {\\it\n  Chandra} data from Xue et~al. (2011) utilised in Mullaney\net~al. (2015). The rest-frame 2--8~keV luminosities of the field and\nprotocluster AGNs are $L_{\\rm 2-8\n  keV}\\approx10^{42}$--$2\\times10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ and $L_{\\rm 2-8\n  keV}\\approx4\\times10^{43}$--$2\\times10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively; we have converted the X-ray luminosities of the field\nand protocluster AGNs to a common rest-frame 2--8~keV luminosity\nassuming a typical X-ray spectral slope of $\\Gamma=1.9$ (see\nfootnote~1). However, the lack of lower-luminosity AGNs in the\nprotocluster sample should not affect our comparison since the average\nSFRs of AGNs are not a function of X-ray luminosity over the redshift\nand luminosity ranges of our sources, at least for field AGNs\n(e.g.,\\ Mullaney et~al. 2012; Rosario et~al. 2012; Stanley\net~al. 2015). Since the SFR is broadly proportional to the galaxy mass\nin star-forming galaxies (i.e.,\\ what is often referred to as the\n``main sequence''; e.g.,\\ Elbaz et~al. 2011; Speagle et~al. 2014;\nSchreiber et~al. 2015), it is also useful to consider the stellar\nmasses of the AGN host galaxies. The stellar masses of the field AGNs\nin Mullaney et~al. (2015) have been calculated by Santini\net~al. (2012) from fitting AGN and host-galaxy templates to the\nrest-frame optical--near-IR data. The stellar masses cover\n(0.2--3)~$\\times$~$10^{11}$~$M_{\\odot}$ and the mean stellar mass is\n$\\approx5\\times10^{10}$~$M_{\\odot}$, which corresponds to $M_{*}$ over\nthe redshift range of the field AGNs (e.g.,\\ Ilbert et~al. 2013). The\nstellar masses of the protocluster AGNs have been calculated by Kubo\net~al. (2015) from fitting host-galaxy templates to the rest-frame\noptical--near-IR data. Excluding the three protocluster AGNs with\nbroad optical emission lines (AGN~1; AGN~4; AGN~7; Steidel\net~al. 2003; Yamada et~al. 2012a; Kubo et~al. 2015), which indicate\nthe presence of an unobscured AGN at optical wavelengths that will\ncontaminate the host-galaxy mass measurements, the range in stellar\nmasses is (0.3--2)~$\\times$~$10^{11}$~$M_{\\odot}$, with a mean of\n$\\approx6\\times10^{10}$~$M_{\\odot}$. On the basis of this stellar mass\ncomparison there are no significant differences between the field and\nprotocluster AGNs, although we note that the protocluster AGN sample\nis small and that there are significant uncertainties on the stellar\nmasses of individual sources.\n\nIn Fig.~3 we plot the infrared luminosity from star formation versus\nredshift for the X-ray AGNs in the protocluster and the field. Using\nEqn~1 to convert from $L_{\\rm IR}$ to SFR, the SFRs of the three\nALMA-detected X-ray AGNs are $\\approx$~220--410~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$\nand the SFR upper limits for the five ALMA-undetected X-ray AGNs are\n${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~210~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ (the SFR upper limits range from\n$<130$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ to $<210$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$). These\nSFRs are broadly similar to those calculated for the X-ray AGNs in the\nfield, although to make a more quantitative comparison we need to\ncalculate mean SFRs. Many of the X-ray AGNs in the protocluster and\nfield have SFR upper limits, precluding the calculation of a mean, and\nwe have therefore adopted a simple approach to calculate the range in\nmean SFR that covers all possibilities. The lower limit on the mean\nSFR is calculated assuming that the SFRs of the sources with SFR upper\nlimits have the extreme value of 0~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ while an\nupper limit is calculated by assuming that the SFRs are set at the\nupper limit values. This approach is conservative since the true mean\nSFR for each of the samples must lie within the calculated\nranges. Using this approach we calculated the following ranges in mean\nSFR: 110--210~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ for the protocluster AGNs,\n80--120~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ for the $z=$~2.3--2.7 field AGNs (mean\n$z=$~2.48), and 40--70~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ for the $z=$~1.5--2.3\nfield AGNs (mean $z=$~1.75). A simple comparison of these ranges in\nmean SFR shows that the protocluster AGNs have elevated SFRs over AGNs\nin the field. However, to provide a more accurate comparison we must\nalso take into account the expected evolution in SFR with redshift of\nthe field AGNs out to the higher redshift of the protocluster.\n\nThe SFRs of X-ray AGNs in the field are found to track the evolution\nof massive star-forming galaxies (galaxies with masses around $M_{\\rm\n  *}$, the knee of the stellar-mass function; e.g.,\\ Mullaney\net~al. 2012; Santini et~al. 2012; Hickox et~al. 2014; Stanley\net~al. 2015) and therefore when accounting for the expected evolution\nin SFR with redshift of the field AGNs we have assumed the measured\nSFR evolution for $M_{\\rm *}$ star-forming galaxies from Schreiber\net~al. (2015); we recall that the mean stellar mass of the\nprotocluster AGNs is also consistent with $M_{\\rm *}$. On the basis of\nthis approach we expect a factor $\\approx$~2.2 enhancement in mean SFR\nfrom $z=1.75$ to $z=3.09$ (giving a predicted range of\n90--150~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ for the field AGNs at $z=3.09$) and a\nfactor $\\approx$~1.3 enhancement in mean SFR from $z=2.48$ to $z=3.09$\n(giving a predicted range of 100--160~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ for the\nfield AGNs at $z=3.09$). Taking account of this assumed global\nevolution in SFR, the mean ranges in SFR between the X-ray AGNs in the\nfield and protocluster are now broadly consistent; see\nFig.~3. Assuming the lowest and highest values in the mean SFR ranges\nfor the field and protocluster AGNs, the mean SFRs of the protocluster\nAGNs are enhanced by a factor of $\\approx$~0.7--2.3 over the mean SFRs\nof the field AGNs.\n\nOverall our results indicate that the growth rates of individual AGN\nhost galaxies in a protocluster environment are not significantly\nelevated over those of AGNs in the field. The masses and SFRs of both\nthe protocluster and field AGNs are also similar to those of typical\nmassive ($M_{\\rm *}$) star-forming galaxies; see Fig.~3. However,\nconsideration of the spatial location of the ALMA-detected AGNs in the\nprotocluster indicates that there may be an environmental dependence\non the mean SFRs. The three ALMA-detected AGNs in our sample (AGN~1;\nAGN~5; AGN~8) lie within the core of the protocluster, at the\nintersection of three filamentary structures traced by LAEs (Matsuda\net~al. 2005; see Fig.~3 of Umehata et~al. 2015). Umehata et~al. (2015)\nmapped this central region over 1.5$^{\\prime}$~$\\times$~3.0$^{\\prime}$\n($\\approx$~0.7~$\\times$~1.4~Mpc) with ALMA at 1.1~mm and measured a\n$\\approx$~2 orders of magnitude increase in the SFR density in this\nregion of the protocluster when compared to the field. It is therefore\npotentially significant that the ALMA-detected AGNs in our sample lie\nwithin this high SFR region. The three ALMA-detected AGNs in our\nsample were also detected at 1.1~mm by Umehata et~al. (2015), in\naddition to another two X-ray AGNs spectroscopically identified to lie\nin the protocluster (a third X-ray AGN with a photometric redshift\nconsistent with the protocluster redshift was undetected at\n1.1~mm). How much does the mean SFR change if we include these three\nadditional X-ray AGNs? Allowing for the 0.1~dex increase in $L_{\\rm\n  IR}$ between the star-forming galaxy templates adopted in our study\nand those adopted in Umehata et~al. (2015), the range in mean SFR for\nthe 11 X-ray AGNs is 270--360~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, leading to a\nfactor of $\\approx$~1.7--4.0 enhancement in mean SFR over that\nmeasured in the field. However, we note that the majority of the\nincrease in mean SFR is driven by a single extreme object which has a\nSFR that is ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~3 times larger than any of the other X-ray AGNs\n(ADF~22a in Umehata et~al. 2015 with an implied SFR of\n1600~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ for the templates adopted in our\nstudy). ADF~22a is the brightest submillimetre galaxy in the SSA~22\nprotocluster (Umehata et~al. 2014) and appears to lie at the bottom of\nthe protocluster gravitational potential and may be the progenitor of\nthe brightest cluster galaxy (e.g.,\\ Tamura et~al. 2010; Umehata\net~al. 2015). Removing ADF~22a from the sample gives a range in mean\nSFR of 140--240~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ and a factor of\n$\\approx$~0.9--2.7 enhancement in SFR over the field, in better\nagreement with our overall results.\n\nThese results indicate that, while there is a lack of significant\nenhancement in SFR for the protocluster AGNs in our sample, the star\nformation in the highest-density region within the core of the\nprotocluster is significantly enhanced. For example, the range in mean\nSFR for just the six X-ray AGNs in the protocluster core mapped by\nUmehata et~al. (2015) is 370--390~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, a factor of\n$\\approx$~2.3--4.3 enhancement in mean SFR over that measured in the\nfield; we note that Lehmer et~al. (2009b) also found evidence that the\nenhancement in the fraction of galaxies hosting AGN activity\ndemonstrated by Lehmer et~al. (2009a) is highest in the densest\nregions of the protocluster. However, these results also show that a\nsingle extreme object can potentially skew measurements when working\nwith a small sample. To provide a more accurate assessment of the star\nformation in the protocluster would therefore require sensitive SFR\nmeasurements for all of the AGNs and the galaxies across the extent of\nthe protocluster, which would also allow for detailed BH--galaxy\ngrowth comparisons as a function of local galaxy density\n(e.g.,\\ Lehmer et~al. 2009a, 2013; Umehata et~al. 2015).\n\n\\subsection{Star Formation associated with Lyman-Alpha Blobs}\n\nFour of the X-ray AGNs studied here are hosted within LABs (LAB~2;\nLAB~3; LAB~12; LAB~14), which provides the opportunity to investigate\nthe star-formation properties for a subset of the LAB population. The\norigin of the extended Ly~$\\alpha$ emission from LABs is a matter of\nsignificant debate (e.g.,\\ Fardal et~al. 2001; Geach et~al. 2005,\n2009; Nilsson et~al. 2006; Dijkstra \\& Loeb 2009; Faucher-Giguere\net~al. 2010; Cen \\& Zheng 2013; Overzier et~al. 2013; Ao et~al. 2015;\nPrescott et~al. 2015), with three leading possibilities: (1) the\ncooling of pristine gas within the dark-matter halo, potentially fed\nby so-called ``cold-gas streams'', (2) the heating of gas by AGN\nactivity (photoionisation or AGN-driven jets), and (3) the heating of\ngas by star-formation processes (photoionisation by young stars or\nsupernovae-driven winds). Previous studies of the LABs in the SSA~22\nprotocluster have suggested that the extended Ly~$\\alpha$ emission is\npredominantly due to the heating of the gas rather than cooling\n(e.g.,\\ Bower et~al. 2004; Geach et~al. 2005, 2009, 2014; Wilman\net~al. 2005; Smith et~al. 2008; Webb et~al. 2009; Colbert et~al. 2011;\nHayes et~al. 2015). By selection, all of our ALMA-observed LABs host\nX-ray AGNs which, as shown by Geach et~al. (2009), already provides a\npotential source of heating for the Ly~$\\alpha$ emission through\nphotoionisation. However, all of the four LABs also host an ALMA\nsource, either directly associated with the X-ray AGN or within the\nextent of the Ly~$\\alpha$ emission, which indicates the presence of\nluminous star formation; see Table~1 and 2.\n\nUsing Eqn~1 to convert from $L_{\\rm IR}$ to SFR, the range of SFRs for\nthe LABs is found to be $\\approx$~150--410~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ and\nthe mean and standard deviation is\n$240\\pm110$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. The range and mean of the SFRs are\nconsistent with those found for massive star-forming galaxies at\n$z\\approx$~3 ($\\approx$~150~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ for $M_{\\rm *}$;\ne.g.,\\ Schreiber et~al. 2015) and, therefore, the X-ray detected LABs\ndo not appear to have significantly elevated SFRs when compared to the\nfield; see Fig.~3. This mean SFR is also comparable to that implied\nfrom the mean submillimetre flux found by stacking the low-resolution\nsingle-dish submillimetre data of the most extended LABs in the SSA~22\nprotocluster (LABs~1--12; $\\approx190\\pm40$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$;\nHine et~al. 2016), which are similar systems to the LABs explored\nhere. By comparison the mean SFR for all of the LABs in the SSA~22\nprotocluster is ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~2 times lower than that calculated here but\nincludes many more compact systems\n($\\approx80\\pm30$~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$; Hine\net~al. 2016). Interestingly, the two giant LABs in our sample (LAB~2;\nLAB~3), with physical extents of ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~100~kpc (Matsuda\net~al. 2011), do not host more luminous star formation than the two\nsmaller ALMA-detected LABs despite being an order of magnitude more\nluminous in Ly~$\\alpha$ emission. To first order this suggests that\nstar-formation activity has less of an affect on the production of the\nextended Ly~$\\alpha$ emission in the giant LABs than for the smaller\nLABs.\n\nWe can quantify the potential contribution to the Ly~$\\alpha$ emission\nfrom photoionisation in LABs by taking the same approach as Geach\net~al. (2009) and calculate the ratio between the\n200--912~\\AA\\ luminosity from star formation (i.e.,\\ the ultra-violet\nwavelengths where the photon energies are high enough to produce\nLy~$\\alpha$ through photoionisation) and the Ly~$\\alpha$\nluminosity. In this calculation we take our infrared-derived\nstar-formation luminosities and convert them to\n200--912~\\AA\\ luminosities assuming the star-forming galaxy template\nadopted in Geach et~al. (2009), which provides a good characterisation\nof the composite SED of the X-ray detected LABs in the SSA~22\nprotocluster. On the basis of this approach we find that the\nluminosity at 200--912~\\AA\\ due to star formation is always at least\nan order of magnitude higher than the Ly~$\\alpha$ luminosity and can\nbe responsible for producing the Ly~$\\alpha$ luminosity with the\nfollowing escape fractions of 200--912~\\AA\\ photons: $\\approx$~5\\%\n(LAB~2), $\\approx$~3\\% (LAB~3), $\\approx$~0.3\\% (LAB~12), and\n$\\approx$~0.2\\% (LAB~14). By comparison, the average escape fraction\nfor all of the LABs in the protocluster is $\\approx$~2\\%, based on the\nmean SFR from Hine et~al. (2016) and the mean Ly~$\\alpha$ luminosity\nfor the LABs. The infrared luminosities of the LABs indicate that they\nharbour dust-obscured star formation and we would therefore expect\nonly a small fraction of the 200--912~\\AA\\ photons to be able to\ndirectly escape and photoionise the extended Ly~$\\alpha$\nemission. Geach et~al. (2009) estimated that the average escape\nfraction for LABs is $\\approx$~0.6\\%; however, we note that, given the\nfactor $\\approx$~5 decrease in the stacked submillimetre flux for the\nLABs in the SSA~22 protocluster between the Geach et~al. (2009) study\nand Hines et~al. (2016), an average escape fraction of $\\approx$~3\\%\nis more plausible. By comparison, Siana et~al. (2015) directly\nconstrained the escape fraction in individual distant galaxies to be\n${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~7--9\\% (1~$\\sigma$ limits).\n\nTherefore, on the basis of our results, star formation appears to be a\nplausible mechanism to produce the Ly~$\\alpha$ emission for all of the\nLABs explored here, although the escape fraction of\n200--912~\\AA\\ photons for LAB~2 and LAB~3 would need to be\ncomparatively high. As calculated by Geach et~al. (2009), AGN activity\nalso appears to be sufficient to be able to produce the Ly~$\\alpha$\nluminosity for all of the X-ray detected LABs in our sample (see\nFig.~4 in Geach et~al. 2009). However, we also note that since the\nALMA sources for LAB~2 and LAB~3 are offset from the centre of the\nLy~$\\alpha$ emission and the X-ray AGN, it is also possible that\nmultiple systems photoionise the Ly~$\\alpha$ emission in these giant\nLABs (as also potentially found for LAB~1; Weijmans et~al 2010) and\ndeeper ALMA observations may reveal fainter star-forming galaxy\ncomponents.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have presented ALMA 870~$\\mu$m observations and calculated the SFRs\nof eight X-ray detected AGNs, four of which reside within LABs, in the\n$z\\approx$~3.1 SSA~22 protocluster. With these data we have found the\nfollowing results:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item Three of the protocluster AGNs are detected by ALMA and have\n  implied SFRs of $\\approx$~220--410~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$; the non\n  detection of the other AGNs places SFR upper limits of\n  ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~210~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. The mean SFR of the protocluster\n  AGNs ($\\approx$~110--210~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) is consistent\n  (within a factor of $\\approx$~0.7--2.3) with that found for co-eval\n  AGNs in the field, implying that galaxy growth is not significantly\n  accelerated across the protocluster environment. However, when also\n  considering ALMA data from the literature, we find some evidence for\n  significantly elevated mean SFRs (up-to a factor of $\\approx$~4.3\n  over the field) for the AGNs at the core of the protocluster,\n  suggesting that the mean growth of galaxies is accelerated in the\n  central protocluster region. We note that the enhancement in the\n  mean SFR at the protocluster core was dominated by a single extreme\n  object, potentially the progenitor of the brightest cluster galaxy,\n  with a SFR of $\\approx$~1600~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$.\n\n\\item All four of the protocluster LABs are associated with an ALMA\n  source within the extent of their Ly~$\\alpha$ emission, indicating\n  the presence of vigorous star formation. The ALMA sources in the two\n  giant LABs in our sample are offset from the X-ray AGNs but are\n  likely to be physically associated with the LABs. The SFRs of the\n  LABs are comparatively modest ($\\approx$~150--410~$M_{\\odot}$) and\n  are consistent with those expected for co-eval massive star-forming\n  galaxies. Furthermore, the giant LABs do not host more luminous star\n  formation than the smaller LABs, despite being an order of magnitude\n  more luminous in Ly~$\\alpha$ emission.\n\n\\item On the basis of the star formation and Ly~$\\alpha$ luminosity of\n  the LABs we conclude that star formation can power the extended\n  Ly~$\\alpha$ emission (through photoionisation) for all of the LABs\n  explored here, although the escape fraction of 200--912~\\AA\\ photons\n  will need to be relatively high for the two giant LABs (LAB~2 and\n  LAB~3). However, since the ALMA sources in the giant LABs are offset\n  from the centre of the Ly~$\\alpha$ emission and the X-ray AGN it is\n  also possible that multiple systems photoionise the Ly~$\\alpha$\n  emission and deeper ALMA observations may reveal fainter\n  star-forming galaxy components.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nOverall, our study has provided a mixed message on the mean SFRs of\nX-ray AGNs in a protocluster environment. From our original ALMA\nsample, which explored a range of regions across the protocluster,\nthere was no strong evidence for a significant enhancement in mean SFR\nfor the protocluster AGNs over that found for AGNs in the\nfield. However, when including ALMA data for AGNs in the protocluster\ncore, evidence was found for elevated mean SFRs over the field,\nalthough the mean SFR was dominated by one exceptional protocluster\nAGN with a SFR ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~3 times higher than the other AGNs. Our\nresults therefore provide some evidence that star formation is\nenhanced for the AGNs in the central region of the protocluster. To\nmore comprehensively measure how much the protocluster environment\neffects star formation would require a complete census of star\nformation across the whole of the protocluster for both AGNs {\\it and}\ngalaxies. Mapping the protocluster with ALMA would achieve this aim\nand, when combined with the deep {\\it Chandra} observations, would\nalso allow for detailed BH--galaxy growth comparisons across the full\nprotocluster environment.\n\n\\section*{acknowledgments}\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the Leverhulme Trust (DMA), the\nScience and Technology Facilities Council (DMA; CMH; IRS; DJR; AMS;\nST/L00075X/1), the ERC Advanced Investigator grant DUSTYGAL 321334\n(JMS; IRS), a Royal Society Wolfson Merit Award (IRS), the Durham\nDoctoral Scholarship (FS).

Three of\nthe AGNs are detected by ALMA and have implied SFRs of\n$\\approx$~220--410~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$; the non detection of the\nother five AGNs places SFR upper limits of\n${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~210~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. The mean SFR of the protocluster\nAGNs ($\\approx$~110--210~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) is consistent (within\na factor of $\\approx$~0.7--2.3) with that found for co-eval AGNs in\nthe field, implying that galaxy growth is not significantly\naccelerated across the protocluster environment. However, when also\nconsidering ALMA data from the literature, we find some evidence for\nsignificantly elevated mean SFRs (up-to a factor of $\\approx$~4.3 over\nthe field) for the AGNs at the protocluster core. We also show that\nall of the four protocluster LABs are associated with an ALMA\ncounterpart within the extent of their Ly~$\\alpha$ emission. The SFRs\nof the ALMA sources within the LABs\n($\\approx$~150--410~$M_{\\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) are consistent with those\nexpected for co-eval massive star-forming galaxies in the\nfield. Furthermore, the two giant LABs (with physical extents of\n${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~100~kpc) do not host more luminous star formation than the\nsmaller LABs, despite being an order of magnitude brighter in\nLy~$\\alpha$ emission. We use these results to discuss star formation\nas the power source of LABs.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\n  galaxies: evolution -- galaxies: star formation -- galaxies: active\n  -- quasars: general -- submillimetre: galaxies\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nA key goal of observational cosmology is to understand how galaxies\nand massive black holes (BHs) grow as a function of\nenvironment. Models of large-scale structure formation predict that\ngalaxy and BH growth in distant high-density regions will be\naccelerated in comparison to the growth of systems in typical regions\nof the distant Universe (i.e.,\\ the field; e.g.,\\ Kauffmann\net~al. 1997; Governato et~al. 1998; de Lucia et~al. 2006; Benson 2010;\nAlexander \\& Hickox 2012). These distant high-density regions can be\nidentified as protoclusters (e.g.,\\ Governato et~al. 1998; Chiang\net~al. 2013), structures where gravitational collapse and coalescence\nhas not yet been sufficient to produce a virialised galaxy\ncluster. Direct comparisons between the observed growth rates of\ngalaxies and BHs in protoclusters to systems in the field can reveal\nwhether galaxy and BH growth is accelerated in distant high-density\nregions of the Universe.\n\nOne of the best studied high-density regions in the distant Universe\nis the $z\\approx$~3.09 protocluster in the SSA~22 field. The SSA~22\nprotocluster was originally identified as a significant overdensity\n(factor $\\approx$~4--6 when compared to the field) of Lyman-Break\nGalaxies (LBGs) and is predicted to evolve into a\n$\\approx10^{15}$~$M_{\\odot}$ galaxy cluster (i.e.,\\ similar to the\nComa cluster) by the present day (e.g.,\\ Steidel et~al. 1998, 2000;\nKubo et~al. 2015). The protocluster has been traced over a\n60~$\\times$~10~Mpc$^2$ (co-moving) region using narrow-band imaging at\nrest-frame Ly-$\\alpha$ wavelengths, which also reveals a significant\noverdensity of Ly-$\\alpha$ Emitters (LAEs; e.g.,\\ Hayashino\net~al. 2004; Matsuda et~al. 2005; Yamada et~al. 2012b) and regions of\nextended (${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~30~kpc) Ly-$\\alpha$ emission (often termed\nLyman-Alpha Blobs, LABs; e.g.,\\ Steidel et~al. 2000; Matsuda\net~al. 2004; Yamada et~al. 2012b) when compared to the field. The\nSSA~22 protocluster therefore provides an ideal environment to test\nwhether galaxy and BH growth is accelerated in a distant high-density\nenvironment.\n\nDeep {\\it Chandra} observations of the SSA~22 protocluster have\nrevealed a significant enhancement (factor $6.1^{+10.3}_{-3.6}$) in\nthe fraction of galaxies that host AGN activity above a given X-ray\nluminosity threshold when compared to the field at $z\\approx$~3\n(Lehmer et~al. 2009a). The increase in the AGN fraction indicates an\nincrease in the duty cycle of AGN activity (i.e.,\\ the duration of\nsignificant BH growth rates) over that found in the field. Given the\nbroad connection between AGN activity and star formation and the\nvarious tight relationships between BH mass and the properties of\nnearby galaxies (e.g.,\\ Alexander \\& Hickox 2012; Graham \\& Scott\n2013; Kormendy \\& Ho 2013), we may also expect an enhancement in the\namount of star formation per galaxy in the SSA~22 protocluster. This\nhypothesis can be tested by measuring the SFRs of the AGNs and\ngalaxies in the protocluster. However, with the exception of the deep\nALMA observations of the protocluster core by Umehata et~al. (2015),\nthe existing SFR measurements for the SSA~22 protocluster have been\ntaken at wavelengths where the emission is either easily obscured by\ndust (e.g.,\\ the ultra-violet continuum or Ly~$\\alpha$ emission;\nMatsuda et~al. 2005) or the data is too shallow to provide sensitive\nindividual SFR constraints on all but the brightest sources\n(single-dish far-infrared--millimetre observations; e.g.,\\ Geach\net~al. 2005; Tamura et~al. 2010, 2013).\n\nIn this paper we present ALMA 870~$\\mu$m observations of eight X-ray\ndetected AGNs in the SSA~22 protocluster to provide sensitive SFR\nmeasurements from even the most heavily obscured star-forming regions\nin these sources. The main objective of this paper is to provide\nsensitive constraints on the SFRs of AGNs in a distant protocluster\nenvironment and to assess whether the host galaxies are growing more\nrapidly than co-eval AGNs in the field. Four of the eight X-ray AGNs\nare also coincident with LABs and we use our data to provide insight\non the star-formation properties of LABs. We have adopted\n$H_{0}=71{\\,\\hbox{km}\\,\\hbox{s}^{-1}}$, $\\Omega_{M}=0.27$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.73$; in this\ncosmology 1$''$ corresponds to 7.8\\,kpc at $z=3.09$. In our SFR\ncalculations we have assumed the Chabrier (2003) initial mass\nfunction.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Data}\n\\label{sec:obs_red}\n\n\\subsection{Sample Selection}\n\nWe selected our eight ALMA targets from the {\\it Chandra} catalogues\nof Lehmer et~al. (2009a,b) in the SSA~22 field. All of the targets\nhave spectroscopic redshifts of $z=$~3.08--3.11, placing them well\nwithin the redshift range of the SSA~22 protocluster (Matsuda\net~al. 2005). All of the targets are also luminous at X-ray energies,\nwith rest-frame 2--32~keV luminosities of $L_{\\rm 2-32\n  keV}$~$=$~(0.9--4.2)~$\\times10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, indicating that\nthey are X-ray AGNs.\\footnote{We note that the rest-frame 2--32~keV\n  luminosity is a factor of 2.2 larger than the more commonly used\n  rest-frame 2--8~keV luminosity, assuming a typical X-ray spectral\n  slope of $\\Gamma=1.9$.}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.0cm,angle=0]{dalexander_fig1.pdf}\n\\caption{Ly~$\\alpha$ luminosity versus rest-frame 2--32~keV luminosity\n  of the eight ALMA targets (filled circle: LABs; filled triangle: non\n  LABs), and LAB~18 (open circle).

(2009a) plus two additional X-ray\nAGNs from Lehmer et~al. (2009b) that have been spectroscopically\nidentified as lying at $z\\approx$~3.09 (AGN~7: $z=3.098$; Saez\net~al. 2015; AGN~8: $z=3.091$; Kubo et~al. 2015). This sample also\ncontains four of the five X-ray detected LABs in Geach\net~al. (2009). However, there are several X-ray AGNs in the\nprotocluster that we did not observe with ALMA (Tamura et~al. 2010;\nKubo et~al. 2013; Umehata et~al. 2015), including LAB~18 from Geach\net~al. (2009).\n\nThe high rest-frame energies probed by the {\\it Chandra} data at\n$z\\approx$~3.09 (2--32~keV) mean that all but the most heavily\nobscured luminous AGNs (i.e.,\\ $N_{\\rm H}\\simlt10^{24}$~cm$^{-2}$)\nshould be detected and identified in the X-ray band (e.g.,\\ Alexander\net~al. 2008; Brandt \\& Alexander 2015; Del Moro et~al. 2015). On the\nbasis of optical spectral analyses (Steidel et~al. 2003; Yamada\net~al. 2012a; Kubo et~al. 2015), five of the X-ray AGNs in our sample\nhave narrow emission lines and therefore appear to be optically\nobscured AGNs while three have broad emission lines and are therefore\noptically unobscured AGNs. Four of the X-ray AGNs are identified as\nLABs (LAB~2; LAB~3; LAB~12; LAB~14), two of which have physical\nextents of ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}}$~100~kpc and are defined as giant LABs (LAB~2;\nLAB~3; Matsuda et~al. 2011).\n\n\\begin{table*}\n{\\scriptsize\n\\begin{center}\n{\\centerline{\\sc ALMA Properties of the X-ray detected AGNs}}\n\\smallskip\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccccccc}\n\\hline\n\\noalign{\\smallskip}\nName  & $\\alpha_{\\rm Chandra}$ & $\\delta_{\\rm Chandra}$ & $z$ & $L_{\\rm 2-32 keV}$  & $L_{\\rm Ly~\\alpha}$ & $\\alpha_{\\rm ALMA}$ & $\\delta_{\\rm ALMA}$ & Offset   & $S_{\\rm 870{\\mu m}}$ & $L_{\\rm IR}$ \\\\\n       & (J2000)  & (J2000) &   & (log(erg~s$^{-1}$)) & (log(erg~s$^{-1}$)) & (J2000)  & (J2000)  & (arcsec) & (mJy) & (log(erg~s$^{-1}$)) \\\\\n\\hline\nAGN~1           & 22 17 36.54 & +00 16 22.6 & 3.084 & 44.20 & 43.71 & 22 17 36.56 & +00 16 22.6 & 0.27  & $1.84\\pm0.21$ & $45.98$ \\\\\nAGN~2 (LAB~2)   & 22 17 39.08 & +00 13 30.7 & 3.091 & 43.94 & 43.93 & \\dots       & \\dots       & \\dots & $<0.92$       & $<45.68$ \\\\\nAGN~3           & 22 17 09.60 & +00 18 00.1 & 3.106 & 44.05 & 43.20 & \\dots       & \\dots       & \\dots & $<1.04$       & $<45.73$ \\\\\nAGN~4           & 22 17 20.24 & +00 20 19.3 & 3.105 & 44.62 & 43.38 & \\dots       & \\dots       & \\dots & $<1.10$       & $<45.76$ \\\\\nAGN~5 (LAB~14)  & 22 17 35.84 & +00 15 59.1 & 3.094 & 44.29 & 43.08 & 22 17 35.82 & +00 15 59.2 & 0.25  & $2.96\\pm0.29$ & $46.19$ \\\\\nAGN~6 (LAB~3)   & 22 17 59.23 & +00 15 29.7 & 3.096 & 44.35 & 43.78 & \\dots       & \\dots       & \\dots & $<1.21$       & $<45.80$ \\\\\nAGN~7           & 22 17 16.16 & +00 17 45.8 & 3.098 & 44.00 & 42.98 & \\dots       & \\dots       & \\dots & $<1.50$       & $<45.89$ \\\\\nAGN~8 (LAB~12)  & 22 17 32.00 & +00 16 55.6 & 3.091 & 43.99 & 42.93 & 22 17 31.94 & +00 16 55.9 & 0.91  & $1.58\\pm0.35$ & $45.92$ \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n\\label{table:SMMJ1237_multispec}\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\caption{The coordinates correspond to the {\\it Chandra} source\n  position and the ALMA source position and the offset refers to the\n  angular separation between the {\\it Chandra} and ALMA source.

The mean Ly~$\\alpha$ luminosity of the X-ray\nundetected LABs in the SSA~22 protocluster (log($L_{\\rm\n  Ly\\alpha}$/erg~s$^{-1}$)~=~$43.1\\pm0.3$) is also similar to the ALMA\ntargets despite being at least an order of magnitude fainter at X-ray\nenergies ($L_{\\rm 2-32 keV}\\simlt10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$; Geach\net~al. 2009).\n\n\\subsection{ALMA Observations and Data Reduction}\n\nThe eight targets were observed with ALMA on 20th November 2012, as\npart of the Cycle~0 project 2011.0.00725. Each target was observed\nusing a 7.5~GHz bandwidth, centred on 344~GHz (i.e.,\\ 870~$\\mu$m:\nband~7). A single--continuum correlator set-up was used, with four\nbasebands of 128 dual-polarization channels each. The array\nconfiguration was such that a total of 25 antennae were used, with a\nmaximum baseline of 375\\,m and a median baseline of 145\\,m. Each\ntarget was observed for a total of 310\\,s. Neptune was used as the\nprimary flux calibrator, with J\\,2225$-$049 used for band pass and\nphase calibration.\n\nThe data were processed with the Common Astronomy Software Application\n({\\sc casa} v4.4.0; McMullin et~al. 2007), and maps were produced\nusing the {\\sc clean} routine within {\\sc casa}. As is the standard\napproach for interferometry data, we ``cleaned'' each target map to\nreduce the strength of the side lobes from detected sources. This is\nrequired to accurately measure the properties of all detected sources\nand to search for faint sources that lie close to the side lobes of a\nbright source. For each target we adopt an iterative approach to the\nclean procedure, following the method outlined in Hodge et~al. (2013)\nand Simpson et~al. (2015). We first create a ``dirty'' map of each\ntarget, using natural weighting, and measure the root mean square\n(rms; $\\sigma)$ noise in the resulting map. Tight clean boxes were\nthen placed around all sources detected at $>$\\,5\\,$\\sigma$ and the\ndirty map is cleaned to a depth of 1.5\\,$\\sigma$ within these clean\nboxes. We then measure the rms in this initial cleaned map, or use the\nrms in the dirty map if no sources are detected at $>$\\,5\\,$\\sigma$,\nand repeat the clean procedure on all sources detected at\n$>$\\,3.5\\,$\\sigma$ in these maps to produce a final map that is\nsuitable for the detection of even faint sources. If no sources are\ndetected at $>$\\,3.5\\,$\\sigma$ then the dirty map is considered the\nfinal map.\n\nThe final ALMA maps for our eight targets have a range of rms values\n($\\sigma=$~0.21--0.34\\,mJy~beam$^{-1}$) and a median synthesized beam\nof 1.10$''$\\,$\\times$\\,0.61$''$. We note that the synthesized beam\nbecomes increasingly elongated at low target elevations, and the final\nmaps have a range of beam major and minor axes of 0.99--1.45$''$ and\n0.68--0.59$''$, respectively. Each map was created with a total size\nof 25.6$''$\\,$\\times$\\,25.6$''$ and a pixel scale of 0.1$''$.\n\n\\begin{table}\n{\\scriptsize\n\\begin{center}\n{\\centerline{\\sc Additional ALMA-detected Sources in the Protocluster}}\n\\smallskip\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccc}\n\\hline\n\\noalign{\\smallskip}\nName  & $\\alpha_{\\rm ALMA}$ & $\\delta_{\\rm ALMA}$ & Offset & $S_{\\rm 870{\\mu m}}$ & $L_{\\rm IR}$ \\\\\n       & (J2000)  & (J2000) &  (arcsec) & (mJy) & (log(erg~s$^{-1}$)) \\\\\n\\hline\nAGN~2 (LAB~2) & 22 17 38.85 & +00 13 33.7 & 4.54 & $1.11\\pm0.25$ & 45.76 \\\\\nAGN~6 (LAB~3) & 22 17 59.34 & +00 15 32.0 & 2.81 & $1.38\\pm0.29$ & 45.86 \\\\\nAGN~7 & 22 17 16.09 & +00 17 47.0 & 1.57 & $2.25\\pm0.34$ & 46.07 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n\\label{table:SMMJ1237_multispec}\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\caption{The coordinates correspond to the ALMA source position and\n  the offset refers to the angular separation between the ALMA and\n  {\\it Chandra} source; see Table~1 for the {\\it Chandra} source\n  positions.

Several apparently significant\npeaks at 870~$\\mu$m are seen in the maps but we need to set a\ndetection threshold to reliably distinguish between real and spurious\nsources. To achieve this we initially identified all $>$3.5\\,$\\sigma$\npeaks in the non-primary-beam corrected ALMA maps as potential sources\nand then inverted the maps and repeated this detection procedure. To\nmeasure the spurious detection rate for a given significance threshold\nwe then simply compare the number of detected sources between the\noriginal and inverted maps as a function of the detection\nthreshold. We find that the number of ``negative'' sources falls to\nzero at $>$\\,4.5\\,$\\sigma$, and hence to ensure that we only include\nrobust ALMA detections we only consider peaks in the ALMA maps at\n$>$\\,4.5\\,$\\sigma$. Overall we detect six ALMA sources at\n$>$\\,4.5\\,$\\sigma$ within the primary beam of the ALMA maps; see\nFig.~2. We measured the peak flux density and fitted a point source\nmodel at the position of each source to search for evidence of\nextended 870~$\\mu$m emission. We do not see significant residuals\nafter subtracting the best-fit point source model, indicating that the\nsources are not resolved in our maps. The peak flux density in the map\nis therefore taken to be the flux density of each source, which we\ncorrect for the primary beam.\n\nWe searched for matches between the X-ray AGNs and the ALMA sources\nusing the {\\it Chandra} and ALMA positional uncertainties. For the\nuncertainty in the X-ray source position we used 1.5 times the 80\\%\nconfidence level of each X-ray source from Lehmer et~al. (2009b) and\nfor the uncertainty in the ALMA source position we conservatively\nassumed 0.4$''$, the average ALMA positional uncertainty measured by\nHodge et~al. (2013). Combining these two positional uncertainties we\nfind that three of the six ALMA sources are directly matched with an\nX-ray AGN (AGN~1; AGN~5; AGN~8; see Table~1), with {\\it Chandra}--ALMA\npositional offsets of 0.3--0.9$''$. The other three ALMA sources have\n1.6--4.5$''$ offsets from {\\it Chandra} sources and are not directly\nmatched to an X-ray AGN (see Table~2). The 1.6$''$ offset\n($\\approx$~12~kpc in projection) between the X-ray AGN and ALMA source\nin AGN~7 is larger than our search radius but still close enough that\nthe two sources may be physically associated. Indeed, investigation of\npublicly available optical--near-IR {\\it Hubble Space Telescope}\nimaging shows that the X-ray AGN is matched to a point source while\nthe ALMA source is matched to a galaxy with a disturbed morphology,\nsuggesting that these are two distinct sources (an X-ray AGN and a\ngalaxy) in a merger with a projected separation of\n$\\approx$~12~kpc. We note that a larger fraction of galaxies appear to\nreside in mergers in the SSA~22 protocluster when compared to coeval\ngalaxies in the field (Hine et~al. 2015).\n\nThe two ALMA sources in the fields of AGN~2 and AGN~6 have large {\\it\n  Chandra}--ALMA offsets of 2.8-4.5$''$ ($\\approx$~22--35~kpc in\nprojection) and are not directly matched to an X-ray AGN. However,\neach ALMA source resides within the extended Ly~$\\alpha$ emission of a\nLAB (LAB~2; LAB~3). This suggests that the ALMA sources may be\nphysically associated with the LAB; see Fig.~2. We can provide a basic\ntest of this scenario by assessing whether we would expect to detect\nany sources by chance in our ALMA maps. To determine the number of\nsources expected in our maps by chance we took the best-fitting model\nof the 870~$\\mu$m number counts from Simpson et~al. (2015) and\ncalculated the number of ALMA sources that we would expect in each\nmap, taking into account both the sensitivity of each map and the\ndecrease in sensitivity from the phase centre. On the basis of this\nsimple test, overall, we predict 0.17 ALMA sources by chance within\nthe primary beam across all of our eight ALMA maps and 0.04 ALMA\nsources within the primary beam across the two ALMA maps of LAB~2 and\nLAB~3, suggesting that the offset ALMA sources are likely to be\nphysically associated with the LAB.\n\nThe 870~$\\mu$m flux densities of the six ALMA-detected sources are\n1.10--2.96~mJy. We calculated ALMA upper limits for the five X-ray\nAGNs without an ALMA counterpart by taking 4.5 times the rms,\nadjusting for any small primary beam corrections when the X-ray source\ndoes not lie at the phase centre. The ALMA properties of the eight\nX-ray AGNs are given in Table~1 and the ALMA properties for the three\nadditional ALMA sources not directly matched to an X-ray AGN are given\nin Table~2. The only source in our sample reliably detected at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths in previous studies is the brightest ALMA\nsource (AGN~5), which has a flux density from SCUBA observations\nconsistent within $\\approx$~1.5~$\\sigma$ of the ALMA flux density\n($S_{\\rm 850~{\\mu}m}=4.9\\pm1.3$~mJy; Geach et~al. 2005). Two of the\nother X-ray AGNs have been previously detected by ALMA at 1.1~mm\nwavelengths (AGN~1; AGN~8; Umehata et~al. 2015) and our 870~$\\mu$m\nflux densities for these two sources are $\\approx$~1.8--2.3 times\nhigher than the 1.1~mm flux densities measured by Umehata\net~al. (2015), which is within the range expected for star-formation\nemission at this redshift. The flux densities of the other three\nALMA-detected sources are below the sensitivity limits of\nprevious-generation submillimetre and millimetre observatories.\n\n\\subsection{Measurement of star-formation rates}\n\nThe rest-frame wavelengths of the ALMA data correspond to\n$\\approx$~210~$\\mu$m at $z=3.09$. Such long-wavelength far-infrared\nemission is likely to be dominated by star-formation activity, which\ntypically peaks at $\\approx$~100~$\\mu$m (e.g.,\\ Brandl et~al. 2006;\nMullaney et~al. 2011; Bethermin et~al. 2015). By comparison AGN\nactivity peaks at $<40$~$\\mu$m and drops off sharply at $>40$~$\\mu$m\n(e.g.,\\ Richards et~al. 2006; Netzer et~al. 2007; Mullaney\net~al. 2011).\n\nWe calculated the infrared luminosities ($L_{\\rm IR}$ over rest-frame\n8--1000~$\\mu$m) from star formation using the ALMA 870~$\\mu$m flux\ndensities following \\S3 of Mullaney et~al. (2015). We adopted this\nspecific approach since the Mullaney et~al. (2015) study provided SFR\nmeasurements of X-ray AGNs in the field on the basis of ALMA\n870~$\\mu$m data, which are used as our field AGN comparison sample in\n\\S3. Briefly, the infrared luminosities are calculated from the\n870~$\\mu$m flux densities over rest-frame 8--1000~$\\mu$m using the\nsource redshifts and the average SEDs of the star-forming galaxies in\nBethermin et~al. (2015). The uncertainty on $L_{\\rm IR}$ is relatively\nmodest because the ALMA data probes close to the peak of the SED for\nstar-forming galaxies at $z\\approx$~3 and is estimated by Mullaney\net~al. (2015) to be $\\approx$~0.3~dex on the basis of the range of SED\ntemplates of Draine \\& Li (2007); see \\S3 of Mullaney\net~al. (2015). See Tables 1 \\& 2 for the calculated $L_{\\rm IR}$\nvalues. SFRs are estimated from $L_{\\rm IR}$ following Kennicutt\n(1998) for the Chabrier (2003) initial mass function; the conversion\nfrom $L_{\\rm IR}$ to SFR adopted in our study is\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm SFR} = {{L_{\\rm IR}\\over{3.778\\times10^{43}~erg~s^{-1}}}}\nM_{\\odot}~yr{^{-1}}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\rm SFR}={{L_{\\rm IR}\\over{3.778\\times 10^{43}~{}erg~{}s^{-1}}}}M_{\\odot}~{}%&#10;yr{{}^{-1}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>SFR</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>IR</mi></msub><mrow><mrow><mn>3.778</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>43</mn></msup></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>g</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msub><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub></mpadded><mi>y</mi><mi>r</mi><mmultiscripts><mo>.</mo><mprescripts/><none/><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mmultiscripts></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
