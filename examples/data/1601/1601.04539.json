Evidently the triadic kagome mesh is a \\emph{divisible mesh} in the sense that $|{\\mathcal{M}}| = a|{\\mathcal{M}}|$ for some scaling factor $a>0, a\\neq 1$. \n\nOne can similarly define {dense meshes} by taking the union of scalings of\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}$ or ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$. \nThese examples can be considered as regular meshes, in analogy with regular tilings of the plane, which only allow a single type of regular polygon tile. Evidently these construction are possible also in three dimensions, and we  formalise a precise notion of a regular mesh in two or three dimensions in Definition \\ref{d:regularlinearmesh}. \n\n\nWe now give some terminology related to the local structure of  nets and meshes.  \n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:vertexfigdilngroup}\nLet ${\\mathcal{N}}= (N,S)$ be a (line-segment) string-node net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ and let  $B(p,r)$ be the closed unit ball with radius $r$ centred at the node $p\\in N$.\n\n\n\n(i) The \\emph{ray figure} $X_r(p)$ of a node $p$ is the subset of the body $|{\\mathcal{N}}|$ which is the union of the line segments $l\\cap B(p,r)$ with $p\\in l \\in S$.\n\n(ii) The \\emph{degree} or \\emph{valency} of $p$, is the number of path-connected components of $X_r(p)\\backslash \\{p\\}$, and so is a positive integer or $\\infty$.\n\n\\end{defn}\n\nWe also define the \\emph{vertex figure} $F(p)$ (or \\emph{coordination figure})\nof a node $p$ of a net ${\\mathcal{N}}$ to be the closed convex hull of $rX_r(p)$ for suitably small $r$. This is well-defined for  the regular meshes defined below and agrees with the usual terminology skew polyhedra (Coxeter \\cite{cox-laves}) and for the realised periodic nets in reticular chemistry.\n\nThe next definition concerns global symmetries. \n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:spacegroup}\nLet ${\\mathcal{N}}=(N,S)$ be a  (line-segment) string-node net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$. For $r>0$ let $D_r$ be the scaling map on ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ with $D_r(x) = rx$ .\n\n(i) The \\emph{space group} of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is the group ${\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathcal{N}})$  of isometries $T$ \nof ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which determine bijections $T:N \\to N$ and $T:S \\to S$.\n\n\n(ii) The \\emph{scaled space group} ${\\operatorname{s-Isom}}({\\mathcal{N}})$ is the group of  maps $D_rT$, with $r>0$ and $T$ in ${\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathbb{R}}^d)$,  whose restriction to $N$ and to $S$ determine bijections $N \\to N$ and $S \\to S$.\n\n(iii) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is \\emph{periodic} if the space group contains a lattice, that is, a full rank discrete translation subgroup, determined by $d$ linearly independent period vectors.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\nNote that the scaled isometries of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ coincide with the affine automorphisms of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which preserve angles and so we may refer to the scaled space group as the \\emph{conformal space group}.\nWe say that two string-node nets ${\\mathcal{N}}_1=(N_1, S_1)$ and $ {\\mathcal{N}}_2=(N_2,S_2)$ are  \\emph{congruent} (resp.  \\emph{conformally isomorphic}) if there exists an isometry $T$ (resp. scaled isometry \n$D_rT$) whose restriction to $N_1$ and $S_1$ determine bijections\n$N_1 \\to N_2$ and $S_1 \\to S_2$.\n\nWe note some simple examples of meshes.\n\nFor countable dense sets $E_1, E_2, \\dots , E_d$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}$  define ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm grid}(E_1, E_2, \\dots , E_d)$  to be  the \\emph{general grid mesh} in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ whose body is the union of the strings with equations $x_i=a_i$, for $a_i\\in E_i$.\nIf $d=2$ and both sets  are aperiodic then evidently \n ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm grid}(E_1, E_2)$ is a planar mesh with no nontrivial translational symmetries.

Note that  the set of nodes is ${\\mathbb{Q}}^2$ and each node has infinite degree. \n\n\\subsection{Regular nets} The next definition  provides a formal definition of a  \\emph{regular string-node net},  in two or three dimensions, and it is terminologically convenient for us to require a regular string-node net to be a discrete net. The sense of the term \"regular\" used here derives from the notion of a \\emph{regular $3$-periodic net} considered\nin reticular chemistry. In those considerations the vertex figure, or figures, of such  nets  appear prominently in various classification schemes. See, in particular,\nDelgado-Friedrichs and O'Keeffe \\cite{del-oke},  Delgado-Friedrichs,  O'Keeffe and  Yaghi \\cite{del-et-al-1}, \\cite{del-et-al-2},\nDelgado Freidrichs et al \\cite{del-et-al-3} and our comments in Section \\ref{s:chemistry} below.\n\nRecall that a countable subset of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ is said to be \\emph{relatively dense} if there is a radius $r$ such that each point of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ lies in a closed ball $B(p,r)$ of radius $r$ centred at $p$, for some point $p$ in the set.\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:regulardiscretenet}Let $d=2$ or $3$. A \\emph{regular string-node net} \n${\\mathcal{N}}$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ is a connected discrete {periodic} line segment net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ with the following properties.\n\n(i) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is \\emph{transitive}, in the sense that for every pair of nodes $p_1, p_2$ there exists\n$T\\in {\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathcal{N}})$ with $T(p_1)=p_2$.\n\n(ii) The vertex figure $F(p)$ of any node is a regular polygon or a regular polyhedron centred at $p$.\n\n(iii) For some (and hence every) node $p$  the rotational isometries of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which fix $p$ and induce symmetries of $F(p)$ are contained  in the space group of ${\\mathcal{N}}$.\n\n\n(iv) The nodes are \\emph{relatively dense} in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$.\n\\end{defn}\n \nNote that  condition (ii) allows the possibility of a regular polygon vertex figure in three dimensions, rather than a regular polyhedron vertex figure. Condition (iv) is in fact redundant, being a consequence of our full rank notion of periodic, but we include it to maintain a parallel with the definition of a regular mesh below.\n\nIn two dimensions it is readily proven that there are $3$ regular nets up to conformal isomorphism, namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$, which are linear, and the net  which derives from the hexagonal honeycomb tiling which we denote as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm hex}$.\nIn three dimensions, much less evidently, there are $5$ regular nets, identified by Delgado-Friedrichs,  O'Keeffe and  Yaghi in \\cite{del-et-al-1}. \nWe give a formal statement and proof of this fact in Theorem \\ref{t:regularnets}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Regular meshes}In the following definition of a \\emph{regular linear mesh} we have the conditions corresponding to the requirements (i), (ii), (iii) of a regular net, while the relative density condition (iv) is replaced by density.\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:regularlinearmesh}\nLet ${\\mathcal{M}}=(N,S)$ be a {periodic} (line-segment) mesh in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ for $d=2,3$. Then ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is  \\emph{regular}  if the following properties hold.\n\n(i) ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is \\emph{transitive}, in the sense that for every pair of nodes $p_1, p_2$ there exists\n$T\\in {\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathcal{M}})$ with $T(p_1)=p_2$.\n\n\n(ii) The convex hull of each ray figure $X_r(p)$ is a regular polygon or a regular polyhedron centred at $p$.\n\n\n(iii) For some (and hence every) node $p$  the rotational isometries of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which fix $p$ and induce symmetries of $X_r(p)$ are contained  in the space group of ${\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\n(iv) The nodes are dense in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIt follows readily from the transitivity and density properties that a regular line-segment mesh is necessarily a linear mesh. The transitivity property (i)  is a natural form of homogeneity making the position of each node in the net of equal status. For regular nets meshes it is also natural to consider the following stronger form of homogeneity.\n\n\\begin{defn}Let ${\\mathcal{N}}$ be a string-node  net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$.\n\n(i) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is \\emph{strongly transitive} if for every pair of pairs of nodes,  $\\{p_1, p_1'\\}, \\{p_2, p_2'\\}$, with each pair lying on the same string and with $p_1\\neq p_2$ and $p_1'\\neq p_2'$ there exists a scaled isometry\n$T$ in ${\\operatorname{s-Isom}}({\\mathcal{M}})$ with $T(p_1)=p_2$ and $T(p_1')=p_2'$.\n\n(ii) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is a \\emph{strongly regular linear mesh} if it is a regular mesh and is strongly transitive.\n\\end{defn}\n\nThe following scaling group invariant in the case of meshes in standard position, plays a useful role in various constructions and is nontrivial for strongly transitive meshes. On the other hand this group is trivial for a discrete net and for the grid mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{grid}(E,E)$ where $E$ is the additive group of rationals $a/b$\nwhere $b$ is any product of distinct primes.\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\n The \\emph{scaling group}, or dilation group,  of a net ${\\mathcal{N}}$, in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$, with a node at the origin, is the group $D({\\mathcal{N}})$ of positive real numbers $r$ for which $r|{\\mathcal{N}}|  = |{\\mathcal{N}}|$, with multiplicative group product. \n\\end{defn} \n\n\n\\subsection{Smooth meshes}We recall that a continuous flex of a bar-joint framework $(G,p)$, with placement vector $p \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^{d|V|}$,  is a continuous map $p: [0,1] \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^{d|V|}$ for which the\nframeworks $(G,p(t))$ are equivalent to $(G,p(0))$, where $p(0)=p$.\nWe consider later how a linear or a line segment mesh may similarly flex through a set of more general meshes, subject to the preservation of internodal distances on strings.\nThe string-node meshes that play this role may be defined as follows.\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\nA \\textit{$C_k$-smooth string} $L$  in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ is a closed set which is the range of a $k$-fold continuously differentiable injective map $\\gamma :I\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^d$, where $I$ is one of the intervals $[0,1], [0,\\infty),$ or\n$(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:net} A \\emph{$C_k$-smooth string-node net} in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ \n\nis a pair ${\\mathcal{N}}=(N, S)$ where $S$ is a countable set of $C_k$-smooth strings $l$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ whose pairwise intersections are finite in number and where $N$ is the set of points which lie in two or more strings and is nonempty.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\nA \\emph{$C_k$-smooth mesh} \n\nis a $C_k$-smooth string-node net ${\\mathcal{M}}=(N, S)$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ whose set of nodes, $N$, is dense in the body of ${\\mathcal{M}}$. \n\\end{defn}\n\n\nFor a $C_1$-smooth string one may define the length between any two of its points. When these lengths are finite the string  may be parametrised by its oriented length from some initial point $x$. Thus, in this case there exists\na reparametrisation $\\gamma :I\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^d$ so that the length of the simple path $\\gamma([a,b])$ is $b-a$ for all $a\\leq b$.\n\n\nFor a simple  example of a smooth mesh (that is, a $C_\\infty$-smooth mesh) consider the two-dimensional \\textit{radial mesh} ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm radial}$\n\n\nwhose set of strings consists \nof concentric circles about the origin with rational radii\n\ntogether with the straight lines through the origin whose angles\nwith the $x$-axis are rational multiples of $\\pi$.\nNote that the central node has infinite degree while all other nodes have degree $4$. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Regular discrete nets}In this section\nwe classify the regular nets of Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet} in the case of three dimensions.\n\\medskip\n\n(I) There is a regular net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, which we denote as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$, with vertex figure equal to an equilateral triangle. \n\\medskip\n\nCoxeter \\cite{cox-PLMS} notes the early discoveries of this net by the mathematician John Petrie and by the crystallographer Fritz Laves, and refers to it as the Laves graph. There are in fact two chiral forms of the net, in the usual sense that its mirror image \nlies in a distinct rotation-translation class.\nIt is known by various names, associated in part with its appearance in crystal structures and we comment further on this later in this  section. In the terminology of Toshikazu Sunada it is referred to as the $K_4$-crystal, reflecting the fact that it is the so-called standard realisation of the abelian covering graph of the graph $K_4$. Details of its construction in this manner\nare given in Sunada \\cite{sun-notices}, \\cite{sun-book}. In \\cite{cox-laves} Coxeter gives a group theoretic construction of it as a graph inscribed on an infinite regular skew polyhedron.\nIn contrast we give a direct geometric construction below together with  an explicit inclusion sequence which helps clarify its construction, namely\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 10677, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]\n\\newtheorem{cor}[thm]{Corollary}\n\\newtheorem{prop}[thm]{Proposition}\n\\newtheorem{lem}[thm]{Lemma}\n\n\n\\theoremstyle{definition}\n\\newtheorem{rem}[thm]{Remark}\n\\newtheorem{defn}[thm]{Definition}\n\\newtheorem{note}[thm]{Note}\n\\newtheorem{eg}[thm]{Example}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \\title[Nets and Meshes]{String-node nets and  meshes}\n\n\\author[S.C.

Various construction schemes are given including the minimal extension of a (countable) line segment net  by an arbitrary countable scaling group. A \\emph{linear mesh}  has strings that are straight lines and nodes given by the intersection points of these lines. Classes of linear meshes, such as the \\emph{regular linear meshes} \nin ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ and ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, are defined and classified. Contrasting flexing and rigidity properties are obtained for some fundamental meshes in the plane with respect to noncrossing motions in the space of \\emph{smooth meshes}.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\\date{}\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\\section{introduction}\\label{s:intro}\nA  {bar-joint framework} is an abstract structure in a Euclidean space composed of rigid bars which are connected at joints where there is free articulation (Asimow and Roth \\cite{asi-rot},\\cite{asi-rot-2}, Whiteley \\cite{whi-handbook}). A  {tensegrity framework}\nis a similar structure in which there are also cables, or strings, (and sometimes struts) which constrain the motion of the joints (Gruenbaum and  Shephard  \\cite{gru-lostlectures}, Roth and Whiteley \\cite{rot-whi}, Snelson \\cite{sne}).\nIn what follows we move in a more mathematical direction and introduce new classes of distance-constrained  structures, namely  {string-node nets} and  {meshes}. By a mesh we mean an infinite string-node net for which the nodes are dense in the strings, which in turn may possibly be dense in the ambient space. Fundamental examples appear in  the class of  {linear meshes}, where the strings are given by straight lines and where the nodes are given by the points of intersection of the strings. \n\nA planar mesh could be likened to a fabric or material, made of infinitesimally thin threads, except that the threads are joined pointwise rather than being interlaced and the join points are dense on each thread. The primary constraint for flexes and motions is that the internodal string lengths must be preserved.\nIn this direction we pose the problem of determining the various forms of flexibility and rigidity of the  {Sierpinski triangle mesh} defined in Section 5.\n\n\n\n\nIn Section 2 we define various types of nets and meshes, such as regular nets and strongly regular  meshes, together with associated terminology, such as valency, vertex figures, space groups, scaling groups and  forms of isomorphism. In fact\ndiscrete {periodic} bond-node nets are prominent structures in reticular chemistry and Delgado-Friedrichs,  O'Keeffe and  Yaghi \\cite{del-et-al-1} have observed that there are exactly $5$ regular such periodic nets in three dimensions.\nThis fact is not so well-known in mathematical circles and, moreover, a simple formal self-contained proof of this classification does not seem to be  ready-to-hand. In Section 3 we provide such a formal statement and proof and we give an elementary construction of the most intriguing example, namely the $K_4$-crystal net (Coxeter \\cite{cox-laves}, Hyde et al \\cite{hyd-et-al}, Sunada \\cite{sun-notices}). We also indicate and comment on the correspondence between our constructs, notation and terminology  and that used by chemists.\n\nIn Section 4 we define and classify  the linear  meshes in dimensions $2$ and $3$ which are regular and also those which are strongly regular. As a consequence we see that the conformal isomorphism classes of the regular linear meshes are parametrised by certain pairs ${\\mathcal{N}}, F$ where ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is a regular discrete string-node net and $F$ is a dense countable abelian subgroup of ${\\mathbb{R}}$.\n \nIn Section \\ref{s:construction} we give five examples construction schemes for meshes. In particular we define  the Sierpinski mesh and the pinwheel mesh, and we show how to construct the minimal extension of an arbitrary discrete line segment net by a countable scaling group.\n\nIn Section \\ref{s:flexibility} we turn to the dynamic considerations of flexibility and rigidity,  and we focus on noncrossing motions of planar linear meshes subject to the preservation of internodal string lengths. \nIt is shown that in the case of a square grid  mesh such motions, if smooth, are necessarily laminar for a finite time interval, in the sense of being determined by motions of two orthogonal strings on the boundary.  On the other hand the triadic kagome  mesh is shown to be rigid for continuously differentiable motions. We also construct meshes which, unlike the square grid meshes, admit local motions, which, to pursue the allusion above, are more akin to the motion of a planar fibred liquid than that of a material.\n \nIn the final section we note  that there are some similar aspects of rigidity and flexibility in  the analysis of  continuous tensegrities considered by Ashton \\cite{ash}, and in the analysis of semidiscrete surfaces in Karpenkov \\cite{kar}.\nNevertheless, our contexts are different and suggest a range of natural, interesting directions and connections to investigate.\n\n\\section{Nets and meshes: definitions}\\label{s:linear}\nWe first define meshes and string-node nets  in the case of strings formed by lines or closed line segments. \n\n\\begin{defn} (i)\nA \\emph{string-node net} ${\\mathcal{N}}$ in the Euclidean space ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ is a pair  $(N, S)$ of sets, whose respective elements are the nodes and strings of ${\\mathcal{N}}$, with the following two properties.\n\n(a) $S$ is a nonempty finite or countable set whose elements are lines, closed line segments or closed semi-infinite line segments in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$, such that  collinear strings are disjoint.\n\n(b) $N$ is a nonempty finite or countable set of points in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ given by the intersection points of strings. \n\n(ii) A \\emph{mesh} is a string-node net such that for each $l\\in S$ the set $l\\cap N$ of nodes in $l$ is dense in $l$.\n\n(iii) A net (resp. mesh) is a \\emph{linear net} (resp. \\emph{linear mesh}) if the strings are lines.\n\\end{defn}\n\nWe also refer to such a string-node net or mesh in a more precise manner as a \\emph{line segment net} or  \\emph{line segment mesh}, particularly when we consider more general \\emph{smooth nets} and \\emph{smooth meshes} for which the strings are curves. Also, when there is no conflict we simply refer to a line-segment string-node net, as defined above, as a net. It is these nets that concern us in Sections 2 to 5, whereas in Section 6 we consider motions in the space of smooth meshes.\n\nIn Section \\ref{s:chemistry} we comment in some detail on the  constructs and terminology used here and those used by Delgado-Freidrichs et al and by Sunada. In particular a \"$3$-periodic net\" in reticular chemistry generally refers to the underlying translationally periodic graph of a material while at the same time certain notions (such as regularity) derive from the notion of a {maximum symmetry realisation}.\n\n\nWe define the \\emph{body} $|{\\mathcal{N}}|$ of a net  ${\\mathcal{N}}$ to be the union of its strings and evidently there is a one-to-one correspondence ${\\mathcal{N}}\\to |{\\mathcal{N}}|$ between the set of nets in a particular dimension and the set of their bodies. \n\nWe remark that, although we do not do so here, in the case of the plane one may consider more general nets and meshes in which strings may cross over. In this case strings may share points which are not nodes and there is a specification of the crossover choice, as in a knot diagram. Improper meshes of this form arise naturally, for example, from folding and pleating moves. \n\nRecall that the Archimedean, or semiregular, tilings of the plane are the tilings of the entire plane by regular polygons, with pairwise edge-to-edge connnections,  such that the isometric symmetries of the tiling act transitively on the vertices.\nThere are $11$ such tilings, $3$ of which are linear and so determine the bodies of $3$ linear string-node nets. We denote these linear nets as \n(i) ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}$, in the case of the regular triangle tiling, \n(ii) ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$, for the square tiling, and (iii) ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}$ for the kagome  tiling, by regular triangles and hexagons.\n\n\nThese are  \\emph{discrete} nets in the sense that there is a positive  lower bound to the distances between nodes.\n\nThe three  semiregular\nlinear nets have the following scaling-inclusion properties. \nTo formulate this assume that these linear nets are in a \\emph{standard position} by which we mean that the $x$-axis is a string and that there are nodes at $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$, with no intermediate nodes. It follows that\n\\medskip\n\n(i) $|{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}|\\subseteq \\frac{1}{m}|{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}|$, for any positive integer $m$,\n\\medskip\n\n\n(ii)   $|{\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}|\\subseteq \\frac{1}{m}|{\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}|$, for any positive integer $m$,\n \\medskip\n \n(iii)\n$|{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}|\\subseteq \\frac{1}{m}|{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}|$, for any odd integer $m$.\n\\medskip\n\nTo see that (iii) holds it is enough to show that if $g$ is a string of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}$ and $m$ is odd then the line $mg$ is a string. The strings with negative slope have intercepts with the $x$-axis that are odd integers, and the strings with positive slope have even integer intercepts, so these cases follow. The third case follows similarly by considering intercepts.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{kagscale6_C.eps}\n\\caption{The inclusion $3|{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}|\\subseteq |{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}|$.}\n\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\nWe define the  \\textit{triadic kagome mesh} to be the linear mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$  whose body\nis the union\n", "index": 1, "text": "\n\\[\n\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{3^n}|{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}|.\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{3^{n}}|{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}|.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" mathsize=\"160%\" movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u22c3</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></munderover><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msup><mn>3</mn><mi>n</mi></msup></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udca9</mi><mi>kag</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04539.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\medskip\n\n(II) There is a regular net, denoted ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$, with vertex figure equal to a square. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\nWe refer to this string-node net as the scaffolding net since finite parts of it resemble a scaffolding structure. \nFigure \\ref{f:scaff} indicates its construction by means of a specification of $6$ representative nodes and $6$ representative strings for the translation classes of the set of node and strings with respect to the periodicity vectors\n$(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2)$.\nThus it may be considered as a periodic string and node depletion of a containing grid net.

In this argument we identify an interesting transitive connected linear periodic net, which we denote as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, whose coordination figure at every vertex is a regular hexagon but which, nevertheless, falls short of the symmetry-rich condition (iii) in Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet}.\n\nRecall the well-known crystallographic restriction for the rotational symmetries of any full rank periodic net in three dimensions. This ensures that such  symmetries have order $1, 2, 3, 4,$ or $6$. In view of this, in addition to the five vertex figure types appearing in (I), \\dots , (V) (ie., regular triangle, square, regular tetrahedron, cube, regular octahedron) there is just one additional vertex figure case to be considered,  namely a regular hexagon.  \n\nTo define ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ define first the \\emph{face-centred cubic net} ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ as the linear net whose strings are the straight lines which pass through the midpoints of opposite edges of cubes that appear in a regular cubical partition of ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. (The companion net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$ has straight line  strings which pass through opposite corners of the cubes in such a division.)\nThe vertex figure of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ is  a cuboctahedron, a semiregular polyhedron. \n\nFigure \\ref{f:fcc} indicates a \"unit cell\" (dotted) for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ with respect to \nthe orthogonal periodicity vectors $(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2)$, together with the following additional features.\n\\medskip\n\n(a) The solid edges and the dotted edges  indicate the position of line segments which together provide $24$ representatives for the $24$ translation classes of the internodal edges of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$.\n\\medskip\n\n(b) The node labelled $B$ (considered a blue node) at the centre of the cell, together with the nodes labelled $g, r, v$ (considered as coloured green, red and violet), provide $4$ representatives for the translation classes of the nodes.\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe \\emph{regular hexagonally coordinated net} in three dimensions is defined to be the string-node net, ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, determined by the $12$ solid edges and their translation classes. In the terminology of \\cite{pow-poly} the finite sets in (a) and (b) provide a \\emph{motif} for the associated periodic bar-joint framework. (In the terminology of Sunada \\cite{sun-book} the solid edges determine the vectors of a \\emph{building block} for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$.)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5cm]{fccNetcellB.eps}\n\\caption{The identification of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ in ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$.}\n\\label{f:fcc}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{fccNetuncolouredBminus.eps}\n\\caption{Part of the linear net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$.}\n\\label{f:Hxg}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\nNote that the vertex figure of the central node $B$ is  a regular hexagon whose containing plane has a normal vector $(1,-1,1)$. Moreover one can readily check that vertex figures\nof the red, violet and green nodes, as nodes of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, are also hexagons, with normal vectors $(-1,-1,1), (1,1,1)$ and $(-1,1,1)$ respectively. Thus, there are $4$ translation classes for the ray figures of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$.\n\nThe net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ is a linear net\nwhich we may view as a periodic linear string depletion of  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$, in analogy with the relationship between ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$ and ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$.\nFigure \\ref{f:Hxg} shows a rectangular block portion of it which includes one interior blue node (labelled $B$) and two interior red nodes (labelled $R$) and their ray figures. \n\nNote that the ray figure of the central  $B$-labelled node in Figure \\ref{f:Hxg} has a rotational symmetry of order $6$ which maps the two red nodes to the two green nodes. This symmetry does not extend to a symmetry of  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ since the edges from  the two red nodes and violet nodes do not rotate to edges incident to the green nodes.\nThus ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ is not a regular net. (The transitivity property holds, with the equation $Tp_1=p_2$ being realised by a translation isometry, if the nodes $p_1$ and $p_2$ have the same colour, and by an appropriate translation-rotation isometry if they are of different colour.) \n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{hxgTOK4net.eps}\n\\caption{The identification of  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ in ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ and ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$.}\n\\label{f:K4cell}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\nThe construction of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ above is given by specifying subsets in a particular (nonprimitive) unit cell for the face centred cubic net. \nIn an entirely similar way we now define ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4} \\subset {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ by specifying  limited sets of nodes and edges in a new larger unit cell for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, with periodicity vectors $(4,0,0), (0,4,0), (0,0,4)$.  The result of this is indicated in Figure \\ref{f:K4cell} by the $8$ solid nodes and the $12$  solid internode edges. We start the specification  by including the  blue node, labelled  $B$, with coordinates $(-1,-1,1)$. A choice is then made of one of the two triples of edges incident to this node which provides a triangular ray figure. The three edges each determine, uniquely, such an edge triple for the neighbouring nodes, labelled $G, R$ and $V$. This determination propagates throughout the unit cell $[-2,2]\\times [-2,2]\\times [-2,2]$ to define $12$ edges. (See Figure  \\ref{f:K4cell}.) Moreover, since the node colouring is periodic this \"common edge\" determination propagates periodically beyond the unit cell and so determines a connected discrete periodic net, which we define to be ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$.\n\n\nNote that the subgraphs  determined by two ray figures that share an edge are mutually congruent by translation-rotation isometries, and\nthat this double ray figure graph is chiral. It follows that ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ is also chiral. Also it follows that\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ is invariant under the rotations of ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ of order $2$ and of order $3$ that act on a ray figure. Thus condition (iii) in Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet} is satisfied.\nThese rotations permute the $4$ colourings of nodes in a transitive\nmanner and so condition (iv) also follows. Thus ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ is a regular net.\n\nTo complete the proof of Theorem \\ref{t:regularnets} it remains to show that each of the five regular nets is uniquely determined as a regular net, up to conformal isomorphism, by its vertex figure, and that ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ is also uniquely determined as a transitive  periodic net, with vertex figure a regular hexagon, satisfying conditions (i) and (iv) of Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet}.\n\nThis uniqueness is elementary when the vertex figure is a square (as with ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff})$, a cube (${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$) or an octahedron (${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$). It remains to consider ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$, ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$.\n\nLet ${\\mathcal{N}}$ be a periodic transitive connected string-node net with vertex figure equal to a regular triangle and\nsuppose that the symmetry-rich condition (iii) of Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet} holds.  Note that ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is not planar, by the periodicity condition, and so the normals of the ray figures of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ are not parallel. By the condition (iii) the normals through the central nodes of the ray figures are axes for $3$-fold rotations. It follows that ${\\mathcal{N}}$ has at least $2$ distinct axial directions for $3$-fold rotation and since ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is periodic  there exist an orthogonal triple of period vectors\n\nand the rotation axes have directions corresponding to the diagonals of a cube. It now follows that a double ray figure for ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is congruent to a double ray figure for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$. It also follows, by the rotational symmetries, that the double ray figures of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ have the same chirality. Thus if we translate-rotate ${\\mathcal{N}}$ in order to identify a single ray figure of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ with a ray figure of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$, then ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is either equal to ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ or its mirror image. \nThe arguments for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$ are  similar. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\subsection{The $K_4$-crystal} Note that the structure of the building block motif in Figure \\ref{f:K4cell} implies the dominant helical features that are visible in larger fragments of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$. In fact there are two types of  infinite helical paths in the direction of the positive $x$-axis which are determined by the periodic colour sequences \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 23770, "prevtext": "\nThis mesh is a \\emph{dense mesh}, by which we mean that the nodes  are dense in the ambient space.

Evidently these construction are possible also in three dimensions, and we  formalise a precise notion of a regular mesh in two or three dimensions in Definition \\ref{d:regularlinearmesh}. \n\n\nWe now give some terminology related to the local structure of  nets and meshes.  \n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:vertexfigdilngroup}\nLet ${\\mathcal{N}}= (N,S)$ be a (line-segment) string-node net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ and let  $B(p,r)$ be the closed unit ball with radius $r$ centred at the node $p\\in N$.\n\n\n\n(i) The \\emph{ray figure} $X_r(p)$ of a node $p$ is the subset of the body $|{\\mathcal{N}}|$ which is the union of the line segments $l\\cap B(p,r)$ with $p\\in l \\in S$.\n\n(ii) The \\emph{degree} or \\emph{valency} of $p$, is the number of path-connected components of $X_r(p)\\backslash \\{p\\}$, and so is a positive integer or $\\infty$.\n\n\\end{defn}\n\nWe also define the \\emph{vertex figure} $F(p)$ (or \\emph{coordination figure})\nof a node $p$ of a net ${\\mathcal{N}}$ to be the closed convex hull of $rX_r(p)$ for suitably small $r$. This is well-defined for  the regular meshes defined below and agrees with the usual terminology skew polyhedra (Coxeter \\cite{cox-laves}) and for the realised periodic nets in reticular chemistry.\n\nThe next definition concerns global symmetries. \n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:spacegroup}\nLet ${\\mathcal{N}}=(N,S)$ be a  (line-segment) string-node net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$. For $r>0$ let $D_r$ be the scaling map on ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ with $D_r(x) = rx$ .\n\n(i) The \\emph{space group} of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is the group ${\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathcal{N}})$  of isometries $T$ \nof ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which determine bijections $T:N \\to N$ and $T:S \\to S$.\n\n\n(ii) The \\emph{scaled space group} ${\\operatorname{s-Isom}}({\\mathcal{N}})$ is the group of  maps $D_rT$, with $r>0$ and $T$ in ${\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathbb{R}}^d)$,  whose restriction to $N$ and to $S$ determine bijections $N \\to N$ and $S \\to S$.\n\n(iii) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is \\emph{periodic} if the space group contains a lattice, that is, a full rank discrete translation subgroup, determined by $d$ linearly independent period vectors.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\nNote that the scaled isometries of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ coincide with the affine automorphisms of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which preserve angles and so we may refer to the scaled space group as the \\emph{conformal space group}.\nWe say that two string-node nets ${\\mathcal{N}}_1=(N_1, S_1)$ and $ {\\mathcal{N}}_2=(N_2,S_2)$ are  \\emph{congruent} (resp.  \\emph{conformally isomorphic}) if there exists an isometry $T$ (resp. scaled isometry \n$D_rT$) whose restriction to $N_1$ and $S_1$ determine bijections\n$N_1 \\to N_2$ and $S_1 \\to S_2$.\n\nWe note some simple examples of meshes.\n\nFor countable dense sets $E_1, E_2, \\dots , E_d$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}$  define ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm grid}(E_1, E_2, \\dots , E_d)$  to be  the \\emph{general grid mesh} in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ whose body is the union of the strings with equations $x_i=a_i$, for $a_i\\in E_i$.\nIf $d=2$ and both sets  are aperiodic then evidently \n ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm grid}(E_1, E_2)$ is a planar mesh with no nontrivial translational symmetries.

Note that  the set of nodes is ${\\mathbb{Q}}^2$ and each node has infinite degree. \n\n\\subsection{Regular nets} The next definition  provides a formal definition of a  \\emph{regular string-node net},  in two or three dimensions, and it is terminologically convenient for us to require a regular string-node net to be a discrete net. The sense of the term \"regular\" used here derives from the notion of a \\emph{regular $3$-periodic net} considered\nin reticular chemistry. In those considerations the vertex figure, or figures, of such  nets  appear prominently in various classification schemes. See, in particular,\nDelgado-Friedrichs and O'Keeffe \\cite{del-oke},  Delgado-Friedrichs,  O'Keeffe and  Yaghi \\cite{del-et-al-1}, \\cite{del-et-al-2},\nDelgado Freidrichs et al \\cite{del-et-al-3} and our comments in Section \\ref{s:chemistry} below.\n\nRecall that a countable subset of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ is said to be \\emph{relatively dense} if there is a radius $r$ such that each point of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ lies in a closed ball $B(p,r)$ of radius $r$ centred at $p$, for some point $p$ in the set.\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:regulardiscretenet}Let $d=2$ or $3$. A \\emph{regular string-node net} \n${\\mathcal{N}}$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ is a connected discrete {periodic} line segment net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ with the following properties.\n\n(i) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is \\emph{transitive}, in the sense that for every pair of nodes $p_1, p_2$ there exists\n$T\\in {\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathcal{N}})$ with $T(p_1)=p_2$.\n\n(ii) The vertex figure $F(p)$ of any node is a regular polygon or a regular polyhedron centred at $p$.\n\n(iii) For some (and hence every) node $p$  the rotational isometries of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which fix $p$ and induce symmetries of $F(p)$ are contained  in the space group of ${\\mathcal{N}}$.\n\n\n(iv) The nodes are \\emph{relatively dense} in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$.\n\\end{defn}\n \nNote that  condition (ii) allows the possibility of a regular polygon vertex figure in three dimensions, rather than a regular polyhedron vertex figure. Condition (iv) is in fact redundant, being a consequence of our full rank notion of periodic, but we include it to maintain a parallel with the definition of a regular mesh below.\n\nIn two dimensions it is readily proven that there are $3$ regular nets up to conformal isomorphism, namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$, which are linear, and the net  which derives from the hexagonal honeycomb tiling which we denote as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm hex}$.\nIn three dimensions, much less evidently, there are $5$ regular nets, identified by Delgado-Friedrichs,  O'Keeffe and  Yaghi in \\cite{del-et-al-1}. \nWe give a formal statement and proof of this fact in Theorem \\ref{t:regularnets}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Regular meshes}In the following definition of a \\emph{regular linear mesh} we have the conditions corresponding to the requirements (i), (ii), (iii) of a regular net, while the relative density condition (iv) is replaced by density.\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:regularlinearmesh}\nLet ${\\mathcal{M}}=(N,S)$ be a {periodic} (line-segment) mesh in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ for $d=2,3$. Then ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is  \\emph{regular}  if the following properties hold.\n\n(i) ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is \\emph{transitive}, in the sense that for every pair of nodes $p_1, p_2$ there exists\n$T\\in {\\operatorname{Isom}}({\\mathcal{M}})$ with $T(p_1)=p_2$.\n\n\n(ii) The convex hull of each ray figure $X_r(p)$ is a regular polygon or a regular polyhedron centred at $p$.\n\n\n(iii) For some (and hence every) node $p$  the rotational isometries of ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ which fix $p$ and induce symmetries of $X_r(p)$ are contained  in the space group of ${\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\n(iv) The nodes are dense in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$.\n\\end{defn}\n\nIt follows readily from the transitivity and density properties that a regular line-segment mesh is necessarily a linear mesh. The transitivity property (i)  is a natural form of homogeneity making the position of each node in the net of equal status. For regular nets meshes it is also natural to consider the following stronger form of homogeneity.\n\n\\begin{defn}Let ${\\mathcal{N}}$ be a string-node  net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$.\n\n(i) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is \\emph{strongly transitive} if for every pair of pairs of nodes,  $\\{p_1, p_1'\\}, \\{p_2, p_2'\\}$, with each pair lying on the same string and with $p_1\\neq p_2$ and $p_1'\\neq p_2'$ there exists a scaled isometry\n$T$ in ${\\operatorname{s-Isom}}({\\mathcal{M}})$ with $T(p_1)=p_2$ and $T(p_1')=p_2'$.\n\n(ii) ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is a \\emph{strongly regular linear mesh} if it is a regular mesh and is strongly transitive.\n\\end{defn}\n\nThe following scaling group invariant in the case of meshes in standard position, plays a useful role in various constructions and is nontrivial for strongly transitive meshes. On the other hand this group is trivial for a discrete net and for the grid mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{grid}(E,E)$ where $E$ is the additive group of rationals $a/b$\nwhere $b$ is any product of distinct primes.\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\n The \\emph{scaling group}, or dilation group,  of a net ${\\mathcal{N}}$, in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$, with a node at the origin, is the group $D({\\mathcal{N}})$ of positive real numbers $r$ for which $r|{\\mathcal{N}}|  = |{\\mathcal{N}}|$, with multiplicative group product. \n\\end{defn} \n\n\n\\subsection{Smooth meshes}We recall that a continuous flex of a bar-joint framework $(G,p)$, with placement vector $p \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^{d|V|}$,  is a continuous map $p: [0,1] \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^{d|V|}$ for which the\nframeworks $(G,p(t))$ are equivalent to $(G,p(0))$, where $p(0)=p$.\nWe consider later how a linear or a line segment mesh may similarly flex through a set of more general meshes, subject to the preservation of internodal distances on strings.\nThe string-node meshes that play this role may be defined as follows.\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\nA \\textit{$C_k$-smooth string} $L$  in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ is a closed set which is the range of a $k$-fold continuously differentiable injective map $\\gamma :I\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^d$, where $I$ is one of the intervals $[0,1], [0,\\infty),$ or\n$(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{d:net} A \\emph{$C_k$-smooth string-node net} in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ \n\nis a pair ${\\mathcal{N}}=(N, S)$ where $S$ is a countable set of $C_k$-smooth strings $l$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ whose pairwise intersections are finite in number and where $N$ is the set of points which lie in two or more strings and is nonempty.\n\\end{defn}\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\nA \\emph{$C_k$-smooth mesh} \n\nis a $C_k$-smooth string-node net ${\\mathcal{M}}=(N, S)$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ whose set of nodes, $N$, is dense in the body of ${\\mathcal{M}}$. \n\\end{defn}\n\n\nFor a $C_1$-smooth string one may define the length between any two of its points. When these lengths are finite the string  may be parametrised by its oriented length from some initial point $x$. Thus, in this case there exists\na reparametrisation $\\gamma :I\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^d$ so that the length of the simple path $\\gamma([a,b])$ is $b-a$ for all $a\\leq b$.\n\n\nFor a simple  example of a smooth mesh (that is, a $C_\\infty$-smooth mesh) consider the two-dimensional \\textit{radial mesh} ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm radial}$\n\n\nwhose set of strings consists \nof concentric circles about the origin with rational radii\n\ntogether with the straight lines through the origin whose angles\nwith the $x$-axis are rational multiples of $\\pi$.\nNote that the central node has infinite degree while all other nodes have degree $4$. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Regular discrete nets}In this section\nwe classify the regular nets of Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet} in the case of three dimensions.\n\\medskip\n\n(I) There is a regular net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, which we denote as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$, with vertex figure equal to an equilateral triangle. \n\\medskip\n\nCoxeter \\cite{cox-PLMS} notes the early discoveries of this net by the mathematician John Petrie and by the crystallographer Fritz Laves, and refers to it as the Laves graph. There are in fact two chiral forms of the net, in the usual sense that its mirror image \nlies in a distinct rotation-translation class.\nIt is known by various names, associated in part with its appearance in crystal structures and we comment further on this later in this  section. In the terminology of Toshikazu Sunada it is referred to as the $K_4$-crystal, reflecting the fact that it is the so-called standard realisation of the abelian covering graph of the graph $K_4$. Details of its construction in this manner\nare given in Sunada \\cite{sun-notices}, \\cite{sun-book}. In \\cite{cox-laves} Coxeter gives a group theoretic construction of it as a graph inscribed on an infinite regular skew polyhedron.\nIn contrast we give a direct geometric construction below together with  an explicit inclusion sequence which helps clarify its construction, namely\n", "index": 3, "text": "\n\\[\n{\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4} \\subset {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg} \\subset {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\mathcal{N}}_{K_{4}}\\subset{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}\\subset{\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm&#10;Fcu}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udca9</mi><msub><mi>K</mi><mn>4</mn></msub></msub><mo>\u2282</mo><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udca9</mi><mi>Hxg</mi></msub><mo>\u2282</mo><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udca9</mi><mi>Fcu</mi></msub></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04539.tex", "nexttext": "  \nAlso, by the rotational symmetries of order $3$, there are similar helical paths in the direction of the $y$-axis and $z$-axis. \n\nIt is also possible to see that the mirror image of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ in the plane $x=0$ shifted $2$ units in the $y$ direction is disjoint from ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$.

It can be proven, as above, that there is only one such net in three dimension namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$, with the cuboctahedron as vertex figure. \n\nWe also define a \\emph{semiregular string-node net} in the following manner (following Delgado-Friedrichs et al \\cite{del-et-al-1},\\cite{del-et-al-2})\n\nby making reference to a hierarchy of transitivity. Specifically,\n\\emph{$pqrs$-transitivity} means that there are $p$ types of vertex, $q$ types of edges,  $r$ types of face and $s$ types of tile, up to isometric symmetries. The regular string-node nets in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ may then be defined as the connected (full rank) periodic discrete line segment nets with transitivity type $1111$. Also ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ has type $1112$ and is the unique net of this type, while ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ has type $1121$. \nWe define a \\emph{semiregular} string-node net to be a  (full rank) periodic discrete net with transitivity type $11rs$ with $r\\geq 2$.  This more general mode of definition requires an appropriate definition of faces and tiles which we need not expand on here. In \\cite{del-et-al-2} $14$ semiregular periodic nets are identified  which also have the (sphere packing) property that there are no intervertex distances less than the common edge length (in a\nmaximum-symmetry embedding). \n\n\\subsection{Terminology and notation}\\label{s:chemistry}We note that a \"$3$-periodic net\" in reticular chemistry refers to a countable graph which underlies a periodic bond-node structure in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. At the same time certain notions for these nets, such as regularity, derive from a reference to a form of \"the most symmetrical embedding\" in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. In a more mathematical vein, Sunada defines such a graph, with the name \\emph{topological crystal}, as an infinite-fold regular covering graph over a finite (not necessarily simple) graph.  Constructions are then considered which yield various standard realisations or equilibrium realisations and so to implicit enumeration  of geometric periodic bond-node structures in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, that is, to mathematical crystals.\n\n \nOn the other hand the periodic string-node nets considered here are more simple-minded primary geometric constructs, logically analogous to material crystal perhaps, and the underlying graphs, in the discrete case, and associated invariants are subsequent considerations. \n\nThe notation we have used for string-node nets and meshes echoes that used for crystallographic bar-joint frameworks in Power \\cite{pow-poly}. There we employed a mainly mnemonic notational style with, typically, ${\\mathcal{C}}_{\\rm xyz}$ indicating a planar bar-joint framework, and ${\\mathcal{C}}_{Xyx}$, with leading letter upper case, indicating a three-dimensional framework. Additionally,  $C_{\\rm XYZ}$ indicated a three-dimensional bar-joint framework (eg. ${\\mathcal{C}}_{\\rm SOD}$) which is determined in a well-defined way from a zeolite framework with name XYZ (eg. SOD, for the cubic form of sodalite).  The notation  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Xyz}$ readily allows adornments to indicate derived structures, such as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}\\otimes {\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\nThe following summary table, for the discrete periodic line segment nets we have considered above, includes the correspondence with the chemistry-derived terminology ({\\bf srs} etc) that has been given by Delgado-Friedrichs, O'Keeffe and Yaghi.\nThis represents only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the striking array of periodic nets that are considered by chemists and co-workers who are interested in mapping the $pqrs$-transitivity territory of materials, so to speak. In the absence of any compelling mnemonic or mathematical reason it may well be natural to carry over the chemical name {\\bf abc} of a net when it gives an unequivocal string-node net, ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\bf abc}$ say, with well-defined  node coordinates in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, up to conformal isomorphism. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}$& valency & figure & {\\bf abc}   & comment  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm hex}$&$3$& regular triangle  & {\\bf -}& graphene \\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$&$4$& square & {\\bf -}  & 2D grid\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}$&$6$& hexagon & {\\bf -} & triangle grid\\\\\n\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}$&$4$& rectangle & {\\bf -} & 2D kagome \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$& $3$& reg. triangle& {\\bf srs}  & SrSi$_2$\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$& $4$& square & {\\bf nbo}  &NbO\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$& $4$& reg. tetrahedron& {\\bf dia}  &diamond\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$& $6$& reg. octahedron & {\\bf pcu} & primitive cubic\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$& $8$& cube& {\\bf bcu} & body centred cubic\\\\\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$& $12$& cuboctahedron& {\\bf fcu}  &face centred cubic\\\\\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$& $6$& hexagon& {\\bf hxg}  & polybenzene \\\\\n\n\n\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Regular linear meshes in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ and ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$}\\label{s:linear}\nIn this section we classify regular linear meshes. The proof makes use of the following theorem which is a consequence of Theorem \\ref{t:regularnets}. However it has  a more direct proof since there is no need to consider the nonlinear regular nets ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ and ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$. \n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:linearregularnets} Up to conformal isomorphism there are $3$ linear regular string-node nets in three dimensions, namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}, {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$ and\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$.\n\\end{thm}\n\nConsider the standard realisation of the regular linear net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri} = (N,S)$ with a node at the origin and period vectors $a_1= (1,0), a_2= (1/2,\\sqrt{3}/2))$.\nLet $F$ be a countable additive subgroup of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ with $1 \\in F$ and define ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}\\otimes F$ to be the  linear mesh whose strings are the translates\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\n\n\\medskip\n\n(II) There is a regular net, denoted ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$, with vertex figure equal to a square. \n\n\\medskip\n\n\nWe refer to this string-node net as the scaffolding net since finite parts of it resemble a scaffolding structure. \nFigure \\ref{f:scaff} indicates its construction by means of a specification of $6$ representative nodes and $6$ representative strings for the translation classes of the set of node and strings with respect to the periodicity vectors\n$(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2)$.\nThus it may be considered as a periodic string and node depletion of a containing grid net. The \\emph{translation classes} referred to here and elsewhere are taken with respect to the periodicity vectors associated with a specified  unit cell or translation group.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5cm]{scaffB.eps}\n\\caption{A generating set of $6$ nodes and $6$ linear strings for  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$.}\n\\label{f:scaff}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\\medskip\n\n\n(III) There is a regular net, denoted ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$, with vertex figure equal to a tetrahedron.\n\\medskip\n\nThis net corresponds to the well-known bond-node structure of the diamond form of carbon. \n\nGeometric detail for this net  can be found in \\cite{pow-poly} and \\cite{sun-book}, for example. \n\\medskip\n\n(IV) There is a regular net, denoted ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$, with vertex figure equal to a cube.\n\\medskip\n\nThe set of nodes of this net may be defined as an augmentation of the set ${{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$  by  nodes at the centre of each of the associated cubical cells. The set of strings  is the set of lines which pass through such a central node and a nearest neighbour. \n\nOur notation reflects the fact that this string node net is associated with the body centred cubic (bcu)  lattice in the Bravais lattice division of crystal types.\n\\medskip\n\n(V) There is a regular net, denoted ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$, with vertex figure equal to an octahedron.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThis is the linear net $(N,S)$  with node set  $N={\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ and with $S$ the set of lines given by integer translates of the coordinate axes.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:regularnets}\nIn three dimensions there are five regular nets up to conformal isomorphism, namely\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}, {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}, {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}, {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$ and ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}We first construct the net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$. In this argument we identify an interesting transitive connected linear periodic net, which we denote as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, whose coordination figure at every vertex is a regular hexagon but which, nevertheless, falls short of the symmetry-rich condition (iii) in Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet}.\n\nRecall the well-known crystallographic restriction for the rotational symmetries of any full rank periodic net in three dimensions. This ensures that such  symmetries have order $1, 2, 3, 4,$ or $6$. In view of this, in addition to the five vertex figure types appearing in (I), \\dots , (V) (ie., regular triangle, square, regular tetrahedron, cube, regular octahedron) there is just one additional vertex figure case to be considered,  namely a regular hexagon.  \n\nTo define ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ define first the \\emph{face-centred cubic net} ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ as the linear net whose strings are the straight lines which pass through the midpoints of opposite edges of cubes that appear in a regular cubical partition of ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. (The companion net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$ has straight line  strings which pass through opposite corners of the cubes in such a division.)\nThe vertex figure of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ is  a cuboctahedron, a semiregular polyhedron. \n\nFigure \\ref{f:fcc} indicates a \"unit cell\" (dotted) for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ with respect to \nthe orthogonal periodicity vectors $(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2)$, together with the following additional features.\n\\medskip\n\n(a) The solid edges and the dotted edges  indicate the position of line segments which together provide $24$ representatives for the $24$ translation classes of the internodal edges of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$.\n\\medskip\n\n(b) The node labelled $B$ (considered a blue node) at the centre of the cell, together with the nodes labelled $g, r, v$ (considered as coloured green, red and violet), provide $4$ representatives for the translation classes of the nodes.\n\\medskip\n\n\nThe \\emph{regular hexagonally coordinated net} in three dimensions is defined to be the string-node net, ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, determined by the $12$ solid edges and their translation classes. In the terminology of \\cite{pow-poly} the finite sets in (a) and (b) provide a \\emph{motif} for the associated periodic bar-joint framework. (In the terminology of Sunada \\cite{sun-book} the solid edges determine the vectors of a \\emph{building block} for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$.)\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=5.5cm]{fccNetcellB.eps}\n\\caption{The identification of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ in ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$.}\n\\label{f:fcc}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{fccNetuncolouredBminus.eps}\n\\caption{Part of the linear net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$.}\n\\label{f:Hxg}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\nNote that the vertex figure of the central node $B$ is  a regular hexagon whose containing plane has a normal vector $(1,-1,1)$. Moreover one can readily check that vertex figures\nof the red, violet and green nodes, as nodes of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, are also hexagons, with normal vectors $(-1,-1,1), (1,1,1)$ and $(-1,1,1)$ respectively. Thus, there are $4$ translation classes for the ray figures of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$.\n\nThe net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ is a linear net\nwhich we may view as a periodic linear string depletion of  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$, in analogy with the relationship between ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$ and ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$.\nFigure \\ref{f:Hxg} shows a rectangular block portion of it which includes one interior blue node (labelled $B$) and two interior red nodes (labelled $R$) and their ray figures. \n\nNote that the ray figure of the central  $B$-labelled node in Figure \\ref{f:Hxg} has a rotational symmetry of order $6$ which maps the two red nodes to the two green nodes. This symmetry does not extend to a symmetry of  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ since the edges from  the two red nodes and violet nodes do not rotate to edges incident to the green nodes.\nThus ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ is not a regular net. (The transitivity property holds, with the equation $Tp_1=p_2$ being realised by a translation isometry, if the nodes $p_1$ and $p_2$ have the same colour, and by an appropriate translation-rotation isometry if they are of different colour.) \n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{hxgTOK4net.eps}\n\\caption{The identification of  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ in ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ and ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$.}\n\\label{f:K4cell}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\nThe construction of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ above is given by specifying subsets in a particular (nonprimitive) unit cell for the face centred cubic net. \nIn an entirely similar way we now define ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4} \\subset {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ by specifying  limited sets of nodes and edges in a new larger unit cell for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$, with periodicity vectors $(4,0,0), (0,4,0), (0,0,4)$.  The result of this is indicated in Figure \\ref{f:K4cell} by the $8$ solid nodes and the $12$  solid internode edges. We start the specification  by including the  blue node, labelled  $B$, with coordinates $(-1,-1,1)$. A choice is then made of one of the two triples of edges incident to this node which provides a triangular ray figure. The three edges each determine, uniquely, such an edge triple for the neighbouring nodes, labelled $G, R$ and $V$. This determination propagates throughout the unit cell $[-2,2]\\times [-2,2]\\times [-2,2]$ to define $12$ edges. (See Figure  \\ref{f:K4cell}.) Moreover, since the node colouring is periodic this \"common edge\" determination propagates periodically beyond the unit cell and so determines a connected discrete periodic net, which we define to be ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$.\n\n\nNote that the subgraphs  determined by two ray figures that share an edge are mutually congruent by translation-rotation isometries, and\nthat this double ray figure graph is chiral. It follows that ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ is also chiral. Also it follows that\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ is invariant under the rotations of ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ of order $2$ and of order $3$ that act on a ray figure. Thus condition (iii) in Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet} is satisfied.\nThese rotations permute the $4$ colourings of nodes in a transitive\nmanner and so condition (iv) also follows. Thus ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ is a regular net.\n\nTo complete the proof of Theorem \\ref{t:regularnets} it remains to show that each of the five regular nets is uniquely determined as a regular net, up to conformal isomorphism, by its vertex figure, and that ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ is also uniquely determined as a transitive  periodic net, with vertex figure a regular hexagon, satisfying conditions (i) and (iv) of Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet}.\n\nThis uniqueness is elementary when the vertex figure is a square (as with ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff})$, a cube (${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$) or an octahedron (${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$). It remains to consider ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$, ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$.\n\nLet ${\\mathcal{N}}$ be a periodic transitive connected string-node net with vertex figure equal to a regular triangle and\nsuppose that the symmetry-rich condition (iii) of Definition \\ref{d:regulardiscretenet} holds.  Note that ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is not planar, by the periodicity condition, and so the normals of the ray figures of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ are not parallel. By the condition (iii) the normals through the central nodes of the ray figures are axes for $3$-fold rotations. It follows that ${\\mathcal{N}}$ has at least $2$ distinct axial directions for $3$-fold rotation and since ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is periodic  there exist an orthogonal triple of period vectors\n\nand the rotation axes have directions corresponding to the diagonals of a cube. It now follows that a double ray figure for ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is congruent to a double ray figure for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$. It also follows, by the rotational symmetries, that the double ray figures of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ have the same chirality. Thus if we translate-rotate ${\\mathcal{N}}$ in order to identify a single ray figure of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ with a ray figure of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$, then ${\\mathcal{N}}$ is either equal to ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ or its mirror image. \nThe arguments for ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$ are  similar. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\subsection{The $K_4$-crystal} Note that the structure of the building block motif in Figure \\ref{f:K4cell} implies the dominant helical features that are visible in larger fragments of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$. In fact there are two types of  infinite helical paths in the direction of the positive $x$-axis which are determined by the periodic colour sequences \n", "index": 5, "text": "\n\\[\n...(VGRBGVBR)(VGRBGVBR)... \\quad \\mbox{ and } \\quad ...

Recall that such nets by our definition are discrete and we may assume that the internodal distance are equal to $1$. By a \\emph{standard position} for a linear 3D mesh we mean that the origin is a node, the $x$-axis is a string, and that there is a string through the origin in the $x,y$-plane which has minimal angle with the $x$-axis. Then we may define ${\\mathcal{N}}\\otimes F$ in the same way as above but in terms of a triple of period vectors.\n\nIn two dimensions there is only one other possibility for a regular linear net ${\\mathcal{N}}$, namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$, and one can check that ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}\\otimes F= {\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm grid}(F,F)$, a regular linear mesh with vertex figure equal to a square. \nAlso it follows that for the regular linear meshes ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}\\otimes F$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}\\otimes F$ the scaling group is the group of order preserving abelian group automorphisms of $F$ and\nhence that the scaling group coincides with $F_*=F\\cap {\\mathbb{R}}_+$ if and only if $F$ is a field.\n\nIn three dimensions one obtains similar conclusions for the meshes ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}\\otimes F$ and \n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes F$. However, for the scaffolding net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$ and certain choices of\n$F$ we may obtain the identity ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}\\otimes F = {\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes F$.\nThe reason for this, roughly speaking, is that if the additive subgroup $F$ contains $1/2$ then the translates of the strings will put back missing strings which distinguish ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$ from ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$. \n\n\n\nLet us say that the additive group $F$ (which contains $1$) is \\emph{an even subgroup} if $1/2^k \\in F$ for all $k$, and that $F'$ is \\emph{an odd subgroup}  otherwise.\n\nWe have now identified various regular linear meshes in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ and ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ which we denote as follows, where $F$ (resp. $F'$) is an additive countable subgroup (resp. odd subgroup) of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ containing $1$.\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[]\n\\noindent $\\dim 2$: \\quad\n${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}(F) = {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}\\otimes F,  {\\mathcal{M}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}(F)= {\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}\\otimes F$\n\\medskip\n\n\\item[]\n\\noindent $\\dim 3$: \\quad\n${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Scaff}(F') = {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}\\otimes F',\n  {\\mathcal{M}}_{Bcu}(F) = {\\mathcal{N}}_{Bcu}\\otimes F,  {\\mathcal{M}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}(F)= {\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes F$\n\\end{itemize}\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:regularmesh}\nLet ${\\mathcal{M}}$ be a regular linear mesh in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ or ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. Then ${\\mathcal{M}}$ has one of the $5$ forms above, up to conformal isomorphism Moreover ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is strongly regular if and only if the associated additive group $F$, or $F'$, is a field, in which case the dilation group is $F_*$, or $F'_*$.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet ${\\mathcal{M}}$ be a regular linear mesh in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ or ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ which is in a standard position. Then the nodes on the linear strings through the origin node have nodes with string distance $1$ from the origin which \nare positioned at the vertices of a regular polygon or polyhedron ${\\mathcal{P}}$ whose centroid is at the origin. By the transitivity condition (i) and the local symmetry condition (iii) of Definition \\ref{d:regularlinearmesh} it follows that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ contains as a subnet a discrete regular (linear string-node) net ${\\mathcal{N}}$, in a standard position, whose vertex figure coincides with ${\\mathcal{P}}$. Thus for $d=2$ there are two possibilities for ${\\mathcal{P}}$ and for $d=3$ there are $3$ possibilities.\n\nLet $F$ be the subset of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ for the  positions of the nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ on the $x$-axis. By the conditions (i) and (iv) of Definition \\ref{d:regularlinearmesh} it follows that $F$ is a countable dense additive abelian subgroup of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ with $1 \\in F$. By conditions (i) and (iii) again it follows that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ contains the mesh ${\\mathcal{N}} \\otimes F$ as a submesh.\nSince this submesh contains all the strings and nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ it coincides with  ${\\mathcal{N}} \\otimes F$. \n\nSuppose that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is strongly regular. Then in addition to the above\nwe have the property that if $p_1, p_2$ and $p_3, p_4$ are pairs of nodes, with $p_1, p_2$ and  $p_3, p_4$ distinct, and on the same string, then there exists a scaled isometry $T$ of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ with $Tp_1=p_3, Tp_2=p_4$.\nLet $p_1, p_3$ be the node at the origin and let $p_2$ be on the $x$-axis with coordinate $x_1$, and let $p_4=1\\in F$. Since $T$ fixes the $x$-axis and the origin it is a linear map and so the restriction to the $x$-axis  is multiplication by $1/x_1$. Thus $1/x_1=T(1) \\in F$ and it follows that $F$ is a field.\n\nOn the other hand suppose that $F$ is a field and that\n$p_1, p_2$ and  $p_1', p_2'$ are distinct points taken from $2$ strings. Since ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is regular we may assume, in proving the strong regularity condition, that $p_1=p_1'=0$ and that $p_2$ lies on the $x$-axis.\nSince $F$ is a field the scaled isometry group of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ contains the group of dilation maps $x \\to \\alpha x$, where $x \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^d, \\alpha\\in F_*$.\nIn particular we may assume that $|p_2|=|p_1-p_2|=|p_1'-p_2'|=|p_2'|=1,$ and so $p_1$ and $p_2$ are vertices of the vertex figure at the\norigin. Since ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is regular there is a linear isometry that maps $p_2$ to $p_2'$, and this completes the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nIn a similar manner one may define directly meshes based on the kagome net, namely \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 42403, "prevtext": "  \nAlso, by the rotational symmetries of order $3$, there are similar helical paths in the direction of the $y$-axis and $z$-axis. \n\nIt is also possible to see that the mirror image of ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ in the plane $x=0$ shifted $2$ units in the $y$ direction is disjoint from ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$.

It can be proven, as above, that there is only one such net in three dimension namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$, with the cuboctahedron as vertex figure. \n\nWe also define a \\emph{semiregular string-node net} in the following manner (following Delgado-Friedrichs et al \\cite{del-et-al-1},\\cite{del-et-al-2})\n\nby making reference to a hierarchy of transitivity. Specifically,\n\\emph{$pqrs$-transitivity} means that there are $p$ types of vertex, $q$ types of edges,  $r$ types of face and $s$ types of tile, up to isometric symmetries. The regular string-node nets in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ may then be defined as the connected (full rank) periodic discrete line segment nets with transitivity type $1111$. Also ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$ has type $1112$ and is the unique net of this type, while ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$ has type $1121$. \nWe define a \\emph{semiregular} string-node net to be a  (full rank) periodic discrete net with transitivity type $11rs$ with $r\\geq 2$.  This more general mode of definition requires an appropriate definition of faces and tiles which we need not expand on here. In \\cite{del-et-al-2} $14$ semiregular periodic nets are identified  which also have the (sphere packing) property that there are no intervertex distances less than the common edge length (in a\nmaximum-symmetry embedding). \n\n\\subsection{Terminology and notation}\\label{s:chemistry}We note that a \"$3$-periodic net\" in reticular chemistry refers to a countable graph which underlies a periodic bond-node structure in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. At the same time certain notions for these nets, such as regularity, derive from a reference to a form of \"the most symmetrical embedding\" in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. In a more mathematical vein, Sunada defines such a graph, with the name \\emph{topological crystal}, as an infinite-fold regular covering graph over a finite (not necessarily simple) graph.  Constructions are then considered which yield various standard realisations or equilibrium realisations and so to implicit enumeration  of geometric periodic bond-node structures in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, that is, to mathematical crystals.\n\n \nOn the other hand the periodic string-node nets considered here are more simple-minded primary geometric constructs, logically analogous to material crystal perhaps, and the underlying graphs, in the discrete case, and associated invariants are subsequent considerations. \n\nThe notation we have used for string-node nets and meshes echoes that used for crystallographic bar-joint frameworks in Power \\cite{pow-poly}. There we employed a mainly mnemonic notational style with, typically, ${\\mathcal{C}}_{\\rm xyz}$ indicating a planar bar-joint framework, and ${\\mathcal{C}}_{Xyx}$, with leading letter upper case, indicating a three-dimensional framework. Additionally,  $C_{\\rm XYZ}$ indicated a three-dimensional bar-joint framework (eg. ${\\mathcal{C}}_{\\rm SOD}$) which is determined in a well-defined way from a zeolite framework with name XYZ (eg. SOD, for the cubic form of sodalite).  The notation  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Xyz}$ readily allows adornments to indicate derived structures, such as ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}\\otimes {\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n\nThe following summary table, for the discrete periodic line segment nets we have considered above, includes the correspondence with the chemistry-derived terminology ({\\bf srs} etc) that has been given by Delgado-Friedrichs, O'Keeffe and Yaghi.\nThis represents only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the striking array of periodic nets that are considered by chemists and co-workers who are interested in mapping the $pqrs$-transitivity territory of materials, so to speak. In the absence of any compelling mnemonic or mathematical reason it may well be natural to carry over the chemical name {\\bf abc} of a net when it gives an unequivocal string-node net, ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\bf abc}$ say, with well-defined  node coordinates in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$, up to conformal isomorphism. \n\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}$& valency & figure & {\\bf abc}   & comment  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm hex}$&$3$& regular triangle  & {\\bf -}& graphene \\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$&$4$& square & {\\bf -}  & 2D grid\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}$&$6$& hexagon & {\\bf -} & triangle grid\\\\\n\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}$&$4$& rectangle & {\\bf -} & 2D kagome \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$& $3$& reg. triangle& {\\bf srs}  & SrSi$_2$\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$& $4$& square & {\\bf nbo}  &NbO\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$& $4$& reg. tetrahedron& {\\bf dia}  &diamond\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$& $6$& reg. octahedron & {\\bf pcu} & primitive cubic\\\\\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$& $8$& cube& {\\bf bcu} & body centred cubic\\\\\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Fcu}$& $12$& cuboctahedron& {\\bf fcu}  &face centred cubic\\\\\n\\hline\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Hxg}$& $6$& hexagon& {\\bf hxg}  & polybenzene \\\\\n\n\n\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\medskip\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Regular linear meshes in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ and ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$}\\label{s:linear}\nIn this section we classify regular linear meshes. The proof makes use of the following theorem which is a consequence of Theorem \\ref{t:regularnets}. However it has  a more direct proof since there is no need to consider the nonlinear regular nets ${\\mathcal{N}}_{K_4}$ and ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Dia}$. \n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:linearregularnets} Up to conformal isomorphism there are $3$ linear regular string-node nets in three dimensions, namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}, {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}$ and\n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$.\n\\end{thm}\n\nConsider the standard realisation of the regular linear net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri} = (N,S)$ with a node at the origin and period vectors $a_1= (1,0), a_2= (1/2,\\sqrt{3}/2))$.\nLet $F$ be a countable additive subgroup of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ with $1 \\in F$ and define ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}\\otimes F$ to be the  linear mesh whose strings are the translates\n", "index": 7, "text": "\n\\[\n\\lambda_1a_1+\\lambda _2a_2 + l, \\quad \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2 \\in F\\cap [0,1),\\quad l \\in S.\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\lambda_{1}a_{1}+\\lambda_{2}a_{2}+l,\\quad\\lambda_{1},\\lambda_{2}\\in F\\cap[0,1)%&#10;,\\quad l\\in S.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>\u2208</mo><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2229</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04539.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $F'$ is an odd countable additive subgroup of ${\\mathbb{R}}$.

Recall that such nets by our definition are discrete and we may assume that the internodal distance are equal to $1$. By a \\emph{standard position} for a linear 3D mesh we mean that the origin is a node, the $x$-axis is a string, and that there is a string through the origin in the $x,y$-plane which has minimal angle with the $x$-axis. Then we may define ${\\mathcal{N}}\\otimes F$ in the same way as above but in terms of a triple of period vectors.\n\nIn two dimensions there is only one other possibility for a regular linear net ${\\mathcal{N}}$, namely ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}$, and one can check that ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}\\otimes F= {\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm grid}(F,F)$, a regular linear mesh with vertex figure equal to a square. \nAlso it follows that for the regular linear meshes ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}\\otimes F$ and  ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}\\otimes F$ the scaling group is the group of order preserving abelian group automorphisms of $F$ and\nhence that the scaling group coincides with $F_*=F\\cap {\\mathbb{R}}_+$ if and only if $F$ is a field.\n\nIn three dimensions one obtains similar conclusions for the meshes ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Bcu}\\otimes F$ and \n${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes F$. However, for the scaffolding net ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$ and certain choices of\n$F$ we may obtain the identity ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}\\otimes F = {\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes F$.\nThe reason for this, roughly speaking, is that if the additive subgroup $F$ contains $1/2$ then the translates of the strings will put back missing strings which distinguish ${\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}$ from ${\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}$. \n\n\n\nLet us say that the additive group $F$ (which contains $1$) is \\emph{an even subgroup} if $1/2^k \\in F$ for all $k$, and that $F'$ is \\emph{an odd subgroup}  otherwise.\n\nWe have now identified various regular linear meshes in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ and ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ which we denote as follows, where $F$ (resp. $F'$) is an additive countable subgroup (resp. odd subgroup) of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ containing $1$.\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[]\n\\noindent $\\dim 2$: \\quad\n${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}(F) = {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}\\otimes F,  {\\mathcal{M}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}(F)= {\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^2}\\otimes F$\n\\medskip\n\n\\item[]\n\\noindent $\\dim 3$: \\quad\n${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Scaff}(F') = {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm Scaff}\\otimes F',\n  {\\mathcal{M}}_{Bcu}(F) = {\\mathcal{N}}_{Bcu}\\otimes F,  {\\mathcal{M}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}(F)= {\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes F$\n\\end{itemize}\n\\medskip\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:regularmesh}\nLet ${\\mathcal{M}}$ be a regular linear mesh in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ or ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. Then ${\\mathcal{M}}$ has one of the $5$ forms above, up to conformal isomorphism Moreover ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is strongly regular if and only if the associated additive group $F$, or $F'$, is a field, in which case the dilation group is $F_*$, or $F'_*$.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet ${\\mathcal{M}}$ be a regular linear mesh in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ or ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ which is in a standard position. Then the nodes on the linear strings through the origin node have nodes with string distance $1$ from the origin which \nare positioned at the vertices of a regular polygon or polyhedron ${\\mathcal{P}}$ whose centroid is at the origin. By the transitivity condition (i) and the local symmetry condition (iii) of Definition \\ref{d:regularlinearmesh} it follows that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ contains as a subnet a discrete regular (linear string-node) net ${\\mathcal{N}}$, in a standard position, whose vertex figure coincides with ${\\mathcal{P}}$. Thus for $d=2$ there are two possibilities for ${\\mathcal{P}}$ and for $d=3$ there are $3$ possibilities.\n\nLet $F$ be the subset of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ for the  positions of the nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ on the $x$-axis. By the conditions (i) and (iv) of Definition \\ref{d:regularlinearmesh} it follows that $F$ is a countable dense additive abelian subgroup of ${\\mathbb{R}}$ with $1 \\in F$. By conditions (i) and (iii) again it follows that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ contains the mesh ${\\mathcal{N}} \\otimes F$ as a submesh.\nSince this submesh contains all the strings and nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ it coincides with  ${\\mathcal{N}} \\otimes F$. \n\nSuppose that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is strongly regular. Then in addition to the above\nwe have the property that if $p_1, p_2$ and $p_3, p_4$ are pairs of nodes, with $p_1, p_2$ and  $p_3, p_4$ distinct, and on the same string, then there exists a scaled isometry $T$ of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ with $Tp_1=p_3, Tp_2=p_4$.\nLet $p_1, p_3$ be the node at the origin and let $p_2$ be on the $x$-axis with coordinate $x_1$, and let $p_4=1\\in F$. Since $T$ fixes the $x$-axis and the origin it is a linear map and so the restriction to the $x$-axis  is multiplication by $1/x_1$. Thus $1/x_1=T(1) \\in F$ and it follows that $F$ is a field.\n\nOn the other hand suppose that $F$ is a field and that\n$p_1, p_2$ and  $p_1', p_2'$ are distinct points taken from $2$ strings. Since ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is regular we may assume, in proving the strong regularity condition, that $p_1=p_1'=0$ and that $p_2$ lies on the $x$-axis.\nSince $F$ is a field the scaled isometry group of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ contains the group of dilation maps $x \\to \\alpha x$, where $x \\in {\\mathbb{R}}^d, \\alpha\\in F_*$.\nIn particular we may assume that $|p_2|=|p_1-p_2|=|p_1'-p_2'|=|p_2'|=1,$ and so $p_1$ and $p_2$ are vertices of the vertex figure at the\norigin. Since ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is regular there is a linear isometry that maps $p_2$ to $p_2'$, and this completes the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nIn a similar manner one may define directly meshes based on the kagome net, namely \n", "index": 9, "text": "\n\\[\n{\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}(F')= {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}\\otimes F'\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}(F^{\\prime})={\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm kag}\\otimes F^{\\prime}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2133</mi><mi>kag</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udca9</mi><mi>kag</mi></msub><mo>\u2297</mo><msup><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04539.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis is well-defined in the sense that the set of strings, and hence nodes, is independent of the choice of the sequence $(n_k)$ for $n$.\nIn fact ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}(n)=  {\\mathcal{N}}_{\\rm tri}\\otimes {\\mathbb{Q}}(n)$ where ${\\mathbb{Q}}(n)$ is the abelian group of positive rationals $c/d$ with $d$ a divisor of $n$.\nNote that ${\\mathbb{Q}}(n)$ is a field if and only if $F={\\mathbb{Q}}$ (corresponding to $r_k=\\infty$ for all $k$),\nand that the scaling group is trivial if and only if\n$r_k$ is finite for all $k$\n\nThe proofs of the following results are now straightforward. \n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{p:5stronglyRegular}For $d =2$ and also for $d=3$\nthere are $2$ strongly regular meshes, up to conformal isomorphism, with dilation group contained in ${\\mathbb{Q}}$, namely\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 49699, "prevtext": "\nwhere $F'$ is an odd countable additive subgroup of ${\\mathbb{R}}$.

We require the set of nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ to be the set $N\\cap K$ and the strings of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ to be the maximal connected subsets of the subsets $l\\cap K$ for the strings $l\\in S\\}$. Examples of such \\emph{intersection meshes} are indicated in Figure \\ref{f:block} and in Figure \\ref{f:sier}, where ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Sier}={\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}(2^\\infty)\\cap S$ where $S$ is the usual Sierpinski triangle. \n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=4cm]{meshgrid.eps}\n\\caption{Some strings of the grid mesh $({\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes {\\mathbb{Q}})\\cap[0,1]^3$.}\n\\label{f:block}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=4cm]{siermesh.eps}\n\\caption{Some strings of the Sierpinski mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Sier}$.}\n\\label{f:sier}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\nIn the former case  $K$ is equal to $(K^o)^-$, the closure of its interior, and the strings of the parent mesh each provide one string for the intersection mesh.\nThe Sierpinski triangle on the other hand has empty interior and moreover the associated intersection is of fractal type. Meshes such as these are much freer of constraints than their parent mesh and present interesting examples from the point of view of flexibility. \n\n\\subsection{Substitution rules} Tilings of the plane, of both crystallographic and quasicrystallographic type, may be defined by various partition and expansion rules associated with a finite set of tiles.\nIn such a case it is often possible to define an associated \\emph{substitution rule mesh} by also carrying out the construction in an inward manner. In these inward substitutions one may use the same subdivision rule. \nFor example, we use this procedure to define  the \\emph{pinwheel mesh}.\n\n The substitution rule for the pinwheel quasicrystal tiling (Radin \\cite{rad}) comes from a $5$-fold division of a right-angled triangles with side lengths $(1, 2, \\sqrt{5}$). If we consider the triangle $ABC$ in  Figure \\ref{f:pinwheel} to be the starting tile for the pinwheel tiling then the first expansion adds the $4$ congruent tiles around it as shown. The resulting perimeter is similar to that of the starting tile so we may outward tile once again in the same pattern, adding $20$ more tiles. Repeating this indefinitely defines the pinwheel tiling. The {pinwheel mesh}  is the dense line segment mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$ that \narises by also carrying out indefinite  inward substitutions by the same partition rule.\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=4cm]{pinwheel.eps}\n\\caption{Some strings of the pinwheel mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$.}\n\\label{f:pinwheel}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\subsection{Projection meshes} Let ${\\mathcal{N}}$ be a (full rank) periodic discrete line segment string-node net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. Then the projection of the body $|{\\mathcal{N}}|$ of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ onto the $xy$-plane is the body of a well-defined string-node net, ${\\mathcal{M}}$ say. If ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is a mesh then we say, simply, that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is a \\emph{(periodic) projection mesh}. Such meshes are multiply periodic. Also there is a connection here with the cut and project method for quasicrystals, in that the nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ might be viewed as a \nperiodic mesh completion of such a quasicrystal. These periodic projection meshes also provide examples of the quite general extension construction\nbelow.  (See Remark \\ref{r:affinedilationgroup}.)  Indeed the projection of the three periodicty vectors for ${\\mathcal{N}}$ provide vectors which generate an affine dilation group in the plane and ${\\mathcal{M}}$ may be realised as the minimal extension of a discrete string-node net by this group.\n\n\n\\subsection{String interpolation algorithms}\nA potentially interesting way of constructing line-segment meshes, from the point of view of flexibility and rigidity, is by a limiting process\ngiven by what might be called a \\emph{string interpolation algorithm}.\nIn this case the nodes and the strings of the mesh are obtained as countable unions of sets which are defined by the inductive addition of nodes and strings according to a well-defined prescription. The resulting mesh may then be considerably less constrained  than those obtained by substitution rules for example.

We require the set of nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ to be the set $N\\cap K$ and the strings of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ to be the maximal connected subsets of the subsets $l\\cap K$ for the strings $l\\in S\\}$. Examples of such \\emph{intersection meshes} are indicated in Figure \\ref{f:block} and in Figure \\ref{f:sier}, where ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Sier}={\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}(2^\\infty)\\cap S$ where $S$ is the usual Sierpinski triangle. \n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=4cm]{meshgrid.eps}\n\\caption{Some strings of the grid mesh $({\\mathcal{N}}_{{\\mathbb{Z}}^3}\\otimes {\\mathbb{Q}})\\cap[0,1]^3$.}\n\\label{f:block}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=4cm]{siermesh.eps}\n\\caption{Some strings of the Sierpinski mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Sier}$.}\n\\label{f:sier}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\nIn the former case  $K$ is equal to $(K^o)^-$, the closure of its interior, and the strings of the parent mesh each provide one string for the intersection mesh.\nThe Sierpinski triangle on the other hand has empty interior and moreover the associated intersection is of fractal type. Meshes such as these are much freer of constraints than their parent mesh and present interesting examples from the point of view of flexibility. \n\n\\subsection{Substitution rules} Tilings of the plane, of both crystallographic and quasicrystallographic type, may be defined by various partition and expansion rules associated with a finite set of tiles.\nIn such a case it is often possible to define an associated \\emph{substitution rule mesh} by also carrying out the construction in an inward manner. In these inward substitutions one may use the same subdivision rule. \nFor example, we use this procedure to define  the \\emph{pinwheel mesh}.\n\n The substitution rule for the pinwheel quasicrystal tiling (Radin \\cite{rad}) comes from a $5$-fold division of a right-angled triangles with side lengths $(1, 2, \\sqrt{5}$). If we consider the triangle $ABC$ in  Figure \\ref{f:pinwheel} to be the starting tile for the pinwheel tiling then the first expansion adds the $4$ congruent tiles around it as shown. The resulting perimeter is similar to that of the starting tile so we may outward tile once again in the same pattern, adding $20$ more tiles. Repeating this indefinitely defines the pinwheel tiling. The {pinwheel mesh}  is the dense line segment mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$ that \narises by also carrying out indefinite  inward substitutions by the same partition rule.\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=4cm]{pinwheel.eps}\n\\caption{Some strings of the pinwheel mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$.}\n\\label{f:pinwheel}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\subsection{Projection meshes} Let ${\\mathcal{N}}$ be a (full rank) periodic discrete line segment string-node net in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$. Then the projection of the body $|{\\mathcal{N}}|$ of ${\\mathcal{N}}$ onto the $xy$-plane is the body of a well-defined string-node net, ${\\mathcal{M}}$ say. If ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is a mesh then we say, simply, that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is a \\emph{(periodic) projection mesh}. Such meshes are multiply periodic. Also there is a connection here with the cut and project method for quasicrystals, in that the nodes of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ might be viewed as a \nperiodic mesh completion of such a quasicrystal. These periodic projection meshes also provide examples of the quite general extension construction\nbelow.  (See Remark \\ref{r:affinedilationgroup}.)  Indeed the projection of the three periodicty vectors for ${\\mathcal{N}}$ provide vectors which generate an affine dilation group in the plane and ${\\mathcal{M}}$ may be realised as the minimal extension of a discrete string-node net by this group.\n\n\n\\subsection{String interpolation algorithms}\nA potentially interesting way of constructing line-segment meshes, from the point of view of flexibility and rigidity, is by a limiting process\ngiven by what might be called a \\emph{string interpolation algorithm}.\nIn this case the nodes and the strings of the mesh are obtained as countable unions of sets which are defined by the inductive addition of nodes and strings according to a well-defined prescription. The resulting mesh may then be considerably less constrained  than those obtained by substitution rules for example. Such an interpolation construction is used in the proof of Theorem \\ref{t:locallyflexiblemesh} to construct locally flexible meshes.\n\n\n\\subsection{Mesh extensions}We now give a geometric-algebraic construction which shows how one may define a minimal enlargement of a given string-node net, ${\\mathcal{N}}$ say, in order that a prescribed countable subgroup $U$ of $({\\mathbb{R}}_+,\\times)$ occurs as a set of dilations.\n\n\n\nWe refer to any net\n${\\mathcal{N}}'=(N', S')$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ with the properties $N\\subseteq N'$ and $|{\\mathcal{N}}| \\subseteq |{\\mathcal{N}}'|$ as an \\emph{extension} of ${\\mathcal{N}}$.

Interesting linear meshes  of this type are the projection meshes of regular linear meshes in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$  for which the projections of a triple of periodicty vectors have incommensurate lengths. In such examples we note that the inclusion of Equation (\\ref{e:nodeinclusion}) is proper.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\\begin{rem}We comment briefly on some categorical aspects of dense meshes.\n\nRecall first that an infinite bar-joint framework ${\\mathcal{G}}= (G,p)$ can be viewed as a particular  placement or realisation of the infinite underlying graph $G$, sometimes referred to as the \\emph{structure graph} of ${\\mathcal{G}}$ or, in reticular chemistry, as the underlying \\emph{topology} of $G$.  Similarly, a discrete string-node net ${\\mathcal{N}}=(N,S)$ has an evident underlying structure graph.\n\nOn the other hand there is no discrete structure graph which underlies a string-node mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$. The appropriate associated \"pre-metric\" structure can be considered to be the topological space $X({\\mathcal{M}})=(|{\\mathcal{M}}|,\\tau)$  where the topology $\\tau$ has a base of open sets provided by the sets $\\gamma([a,b])$\nin ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ arising from parametrisations of the strings and parameter values $a<b$. In fact, although, for simplicity, we have chosen to define strings as nonoverlapping subsets, one could equally well (from the perspective of rigidity and flexibility, for example) allow strings to overlap, and indeed, admit all sets $\\gamma([a,b])$ between nodes as strings. \nWith this perspective the topological space $X({\\mathcal{M}})$  underlying the mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$ supports a Borel measure, defined by the \"placement\" ${\\mathcal{M}}$, namely the \\emph{string length\nmeasure} $\\mu_{\\mathcal{M}}$, determined by the strings in the canonical way. \n\nWe note that the mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}=(N,S)$ also gives rise naturally to a metric space $(|{\\mathcal{M}}|,d)$.\nThe metric $d$ is given by\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 62082, "prevtext": "\nare all no greater  than $\\epsilon$.

Also each equivalence class $[x]$ is  convex. For if this were not the case then there exist $y, z$ in $[x]$ with $y<z$ and an intermediate point $w$ which is not in $[x]$ and so, by the closedness of $[x]$,  $w$ is contained in a finite closed  interval $J$ disjoint from $[x]$, of width $\\delta>0$ say.

It remains to show that every element of $U$ is an element of the scaling group of ${{\\mathcal{N}}}_U$.\n\nLet $g_1$ and $g_2$ be two distinct straight lines with $g_2=d(g_1)$ for some $d\\in U$. Since $U$ is a group it follows that $S'\\cap g_1 = d(S'\\cap g_2)$. Also $d$ is a bi-Lipschitz map  and so it follows that $d$ effects a bijection between the disjoint closed covers of these sets of intervals.

Interesting linear meshes  of this type are the projection meshes of regular linear meshes in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$  for which the projections of a triple of periodicty vectors have incommensurate lengths. In such examples we note that the inclusion of Equation (\\ref{e:nodeinclusion}) is proper.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\\begin{rem}We comment briefly on some categorical aspects of dense meshes.\n\nRecall first that an infinite bar-joint framework ${\\mathcal{G}}= (G,p)$ can be viewed as a particular  placement or realisation of the infinite underlying graph $G$, sometimes referred to as the \\emph{structure graph} of ${\\mathcal{G}}$ or, in reticular chemistry, as the underlying \\emph{topology} of $G$.  Similarly, a discrete string-node net ${\\mathcal{N}}=(N,S)$ has an evident underlying structure graph.\n\nOn the other hand there is no discrete structure graph which underlies a string-node mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$. The appropriate associated \"pre-metric\" structure can be considered to be the topological space $X({\\mathcal{M}})=(|{\\mathcal{M}}|,\\tau)$  where the topology $\\tau$ has a base of open sets provided by the sets $\\gamma([a,b])$\nin ${\\mathbb{R}}^d$ arising from parametrisations of the strings and parameter values $a<b$. In fact, although, for simplicity, we have chosen to define strings as nonoverlapping subsets, one could equally well (from the perspective of rigidity and flexibility, for example) allow strings to overlap, and indeed, admit all sets $\\gamma([a,b])$ between nodes as strings. \nWith this perspective the topological space $X({\\mathcal{M}})$  underlying the mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$ supports a Borel measure, defined by the \"placement\" ${\\mathcal{M}}$, namely the \\emph{string length\nmeasure} $\\mu_{\\mathcal{M}}$, determined by the strings in the canonical way. \n\nWe note that the mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}=(N,S)$ also gives rise naturally to a metric space $(|{\\mathcal{M}}|,d)$.\nThe metric $d$ is given by\n", "index": 21, "text": "\n\\[\nd(x,y) = \\inf (d_{\\gamma_1}(x_1,x_2) +d_{\\gamma_2}(x_2,x_3)+\\dots +\nd_{\\gamma_r}(x_{r-1},x_r))\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"d(x,y)=\\inf(d_{\\gamma_{1}}(x_{1},x_{2})+d_{\\gamma_{2}}(x_{2},x_{3})+\\dots+d_{%&#10;\\gamma_{r}}(x_{r-1},x_{r}))\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">inf</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>r</mi></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04539.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the sum is a vector sum for the maps $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2: [0,1]\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^2$.\nA \\emph{laminar placement} of ${\\mathcal{M}}_q$ is a placement $p:|{\\mathcal{M}}_q| \\to {\\mathbb{R}}^2$ which is the restriction of a laminar map.\n\nNote that a laminar map is string length preserving for ${\\mathcal{M}}_q$\nif the maps $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2$ are length preserving.\nSimple examples show that a  laminar map need not be injective and so need not define a placement.

Indeed,\nthe corresponding laminarity condition, defined in terms of a three-fold vector sum, might be referred to a \\emph{strong laminarity}. The reason for this, to pursue the material analogy, is that a bounded 2D mesh in a plane in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ admits continuous and smooth motions analogous to that of a sheet of paper, and one can repeat such motions in a parallel manner to obtain continuous flexes.\n\n\nWe consider next the triadic kagome mesh. \nRecall that the infinite periodic kagome bar-joint framework admits diverse continuous motions which are periodic in some sense. \nSee \\cite{kap-tre-tho-gue}, \\cite{owe-pow-nyjm-1} for example. We now show that in contrast to the rectangular case above, this flexibility does not carry over in any way to the triadic kagome mesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:triadicrigid}\nA $C_1$-smooth placement of the triadic kagome mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$\nis congruent to the identity placement. In particular ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$  is rigid with respect to $C_1$-smooth flexes.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nIt will be sufficient to show that any $C_1$-smooth placement of \n${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$ is congruent to the identity placement of ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$. \nNote that such a placement, $p_t$ say, has a\nunique continuous extension of $p_t: {\\mathbb{R}}^2\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^2$. Moreover, a restriction of this extension defines a string length preserving placement of the containing triadic triangular mesh, ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}$. It suffices then to show that the $C_1$-smooth  mesh ${\\mathcal{M}} = p_t({\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri})$, defined by the range of this  placement, is congruent to ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}$.\n\nLet  $0<t<1$ and let $q_0$ be a node of the mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$.  By the  $C_1$-smoothness of the strings of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ there are $3$ three unit tangent vectors to the three  strings through $q_0$, say $a_1, a_2, a_3$. We may choose these vectors so that the vectors $a_1, a_2, a_3, -a_1, -a_2, -a_3$ correspond to a consecutive sequence of points on the unit circle, with the angles between $a_1, a_2$ and between $a_2, a_3$ acute angles. \nWe claim that all the consecutive angles are equal to $\\pi/3$. To see this it is sufficient to note that no consecutive angle is greater than $\\pi/3$. We now  show that this follows from the string length preservation property applied to cross-strings connecting nodes on adjacent strings through $q_0$. \n\nLet $q_0'$ be the node in ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}$ which is the preimage of $q_0$ under $p_t$, and let $q_1'$ and $q_2'$ be nodes on adjacent strings through $q_0'$ which lie on a common cross string.\nThe internodal string lengths agree with the Euclidean distances, $\\|q_1' - q_2'\\|, \\|q_1'-q_0'\\|$ and $\\|q_2'-q_0'\\|$ respectively, and these lengths are equal. \nLet $q_1, q_2$ be the images of $q_1', q_2'$ under $p_t$. Since $p_t$ preserves string lengths we have $d_{01}=d_{12}=d_{02}$ where $d_{ij}$ is the string distance between $q_i$ and $q_j$ for the (unique) string $l_{ij}$ of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ through $q_i, q_j$.\n\nSuppose now, by way of contradiction, that angle between the tangent vectors at $q_0$ for the strings $l_{01}$ and $l_{02}$ is greater than $\\pi/3$. Then \n\\medskip\n\n\n(i) the ratio $\\|q_1-q_2\\|/\\|q_1-q_0\\|$ has a finite  limit  greater than $1$ as $q_1$ tends to $q_0$.\n\\medskip\n\nAlso, by string length preservation,\n\\medskip\n\n(ii) the ratio $d_{01}/\\|q_1-q_0\\|$ has limit $1$, as $q_1$ tends to $q_0$,\n\\medskip\n\nand, by the triangle inequality,\n\\medskip\n\n(iii)   $d_{12}$  is not less than $\\|q_1-q_2\\|$.\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip\n\nCombining the above it follows that if  $q_1$ is sufficiently close to $q_0$ then\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 72302, "prevtext": "\n\nSince, by (iii), the tangent vectors for the two strings through $(x,y)$\nare not colinear we deduce that\n", "index": 35, "text": "\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}p(x,y) =0\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex17.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}p(x,y)=0\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mo>\u2202</mo><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mo>\u2202</mo><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04539.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhich is a contradiction.\n\nWe have shown that the placement map $p_t$ is conformal, in the sense of preserving the (well-defined) angles between strings at the nodes.

In particular ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$  is rigid in the space of $C_1$-smooth meshes.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThe diagram of Figure \\ref{f:pinwheel} defines a subnet of the pinwheel mesh. Note that there are $8$ line segment strings in the pinwheel mesh that have the node at $D$ as a terminal node. Two of these correspond to the line segments $AD$ and $BD$, three further strings correspond to three of the line segments interior to the triangle $ABC$, and three further strings lie in the triangle $OAB$. The node at $D$ has degree $8$ in the mesh. Let $a_1$ be a unit vector in the direction $D$ to $B$ and let $a_2,\\dots , a_8$ be the successive unit vectors for the remaining $7$ strings incident to the node at $D$. \nLet $\\theta_i$ be the angle between the pairs $a_i, a_{i+1}$, for $1\\leq i\\leq 8$,   so that $\\theta_1 + \\dots +\\theta_8 =2\\pi$.\nNote that it follows from the inductive construction of ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$ that for each of the $8$ successive pair of strings there is a sequence of cross strings whose nodes converge to the node at $D$. \n\nConsider now a $C_1$-smooth placement ${\\mathcal{M}}$ of ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$. Then the image of the strings through the node at $D$ have corresponding direction vectors $b_1, \\dots ,b_8$ and corresponding consecutive angles $\\phi_1, \\dots , \\phi_8$.  By the limiting triangle inequality argument above we have $\\phi_i \\leq \\theta_i$, for each $i$, and so in fact equality holds for each $i$. \n\nNote that in fact  every string of  ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$ has a dense set of nodes of this type (up to rotation). It follows that the placement $p_t$ is conformal and hence  that ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is congruent to ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm pin}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\begin{rem} We have defined the Sierpinski mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Sier}$ to be the line segment mesh whose strings are the line segments that appear in the construction of the Sierpinski triangle.  The nodes on the interior strings have degree $4$ and have the same local geometry, up to rotation. Indeed each such node has a cycle of  $4$ adjacent tangent angles between the incident strings, namely\n$\\pi/3, \\pi /3, \\pi/3$ and $\\pi$ with only the first and third of these being infinitesimally triangulated, in the sense given in the proof of the previous theorem.\nIt follows that for any placement one obtains only a partial subconformality condition, namely that the two corresponding tangent angles are no greater than $\\pi/3$. Thus further argument is required to show that the $C_1$-smooth placements of ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm Sier}$ are trivial, if indeed this is the case. We leave as open problems the determination of whether the Sierpinski mesh is smoothly flexible or continuously flexible  \n\\end{rem}\n\n\\begin{rem}\nThe noncrossing requirement in our definition of continuous and smooth flexes, which ensures proper nonintersecting motions, presents some interesting general configuration space questions in the case of flexible bounded meshes. Recalling that a bounded mesh $ {\\mathcal{M}}$ is necessarily connected we may define the \\emph{minumum diameter} $d_{\\rm min}({\\mathcal{M}})$ to be the infimum of the diameters of the placements $p(|{\\mathcal{M}}|)$ of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ occurring in any continuous flex. (In a similar way one can define the \\emph{maximum diameter} $d_{\\rm max}({\\mathcal{M}})$ which generally seems to be easier to compute.) For ${\\mathcal{M}}_q$ the minimum diameter is no greater than $1$ in view of elementary concertina motions, and it seems plausible that  $d_{\\rm min}({\\mathcal{M}}_q)= 1$. We leave open the problem of determining the minimum diameters of the bounded rectangular meshes and Sierpinski meshes in dimensions $2$ and $3$.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\n\\subsection{Locally flexible meshes} Finally, we show that there are simple inductive constructions that lead to dense line segment meshes ${\\mathcal{M}}$ in the plane which are highly flexible.\n\nLet us say that a line segment mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$ is \\emph{locally flexible} if there exists a bounded open set $U$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ and a path of homeomorphisms $p_t$ of ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$, for $t\\in [0,1]$, such that\n$p=(p_t)$ is a nontrivial continuous (string length preserving) flex of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ with $p_t(x,y)=(x,y)$ for all points $(x,y)$ in the complement of $U$.\n\n\n\\medskip\n\nIn fact there is sufficient freedom in the construction of such meshes below that we can arrange that each of the placements $p_t$ is isometric on each line segment string. Another way of expressing this is to introduce the class of \\emph{rod-pin meshes}. Let us define a rod-pin mesh somewhat informally as\na line segment string-node mesh for which the strings are inflexible rods. As with finite rod-pin frameworks, rods may be joined at their endpoints or at interior points and so  there are $3$ forms of joining nodes for a pair of rods: a double end point node, a single end point node, or a  double interior point node. A flex of a rod-pin mesh is then a continuous flex of the associated line segment string-node mesh \nsuch that the restriction to each string  is isometric.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:locallyflexiblemesh} Let $r\\geq 3$ be a positive integer. Then there exists a locally flexible dense rod-pin mesh in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ such that the degree of every node is $r$.\n\\end{thm} \n\n\\begin{proof}\nConsider a cyclic rod-pin framework ${\\mathcal{G}}_0= (G_0, p)$ with $4$ bars and $4$ joints as in the left hand side diagram of Figure \\ref{f:stretchy}.\n\nWe construct a bounded rod-pin mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$, such that (i) $\\partial |{\\mathcal{M}}|=|{\\mathcal{G}}_0|$, (ii) the closure of $|{\\mathcal{M}}|$ is $|{\\mathcal{G}}_0|$ together with the interior region, and\n(iii) ${\\mathcal{M}}$ has a nontrivial  boundary fixed continuous flex.\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{stretchymesh2.eps}\n\\caption{Constructing a locally flexible rod-pin mesh.}\n\\label{f:stretchy}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\nStep $n= 1$: Add a rod-pin path framework (dotted in the figure) which lies in the bounded region interior to the boundary and has the following properties. The added path of rods has its end joints  pinned at $2$ joints on  the boundary, there are at least $2$ other joints, and there is a nonconstant continuous flex $p(t)$ of the combined rod-pin framework which fixes the $4$ boundary bars. A boundary joint for this path may be an existing joint for ${\\mathcal{G}}_0$ (as illustrated) or may be a new joint which is interior to one of the rods on the boundary. Let $p(t), t\\in [0,1]$, be any nontrivial flex of the resulting framework ${\\mathcal{G}}_1$ which fixes the outer boundary and for which there are no self intersections of nodes and joints.\n\nSteps $n = 2, 3, \\dots $ : Repeat Step 1 for the two open regions, to obtain frameworks ${\\mathcal{G}}_3 \\supset {\\mathcal{G}}_2 \\supset {\\mathcal{G}}_1$, after which\n(Steps $n = 4, 5, \\dots $) repeat such divisions for the resulting regions, and so on, ad infinitum, according to the following requirements.\n\n(a) The flex $p(t), t\\in [0,1]$, of ${\\mathcal{G}}_{n-1}$  extends to a flex of ${\\mathcal{G}}_n$, also denoted $p(t)$, of the augmented framework. Realising this property is elementary since the added rod-pin path can possess an arbitrary finite number of nodes and we are only required to obtain a motion of the augmented path which can remain interior to the appropriate region of the complement of $(G_{n-1}, p(t))$ at time $t$.\n\n(b) The maximum of the diameters of the regions at Step $n$, and the maximum of the areas of the regions at Step $n$, tend to zero as $n$ tends to infinity. This can be assured by adding a rod-pin path to reduce a maximum diameter, or reduce a maximum area, when $n$ is divisible by $3$.\n\n(c) The following \\emph{joint exhaustion process} is adopted. The joints introduced at Step $n$ are labelled as additions to a sequence $v_1, \\dots ,v_{m_n}$. \nIf the degree of $v_i$ is equal to $r$ then this joint is not revisited, meaning that this joint is not used as an end point for a subsequent rod-pin path. If, on the other hand, $v_j$ is the first joint with degree less than $r$, and if $n$ is congruent to $1$ mod $3$,  then this joint is revisited.\n\n(d) If $n$ is congruent to $2$ mod $3$ then one of the end joints of the rod-pin path is chosen to be the midpoint of a pre-existing rod with maximum length.\n\nThis process of construction defines a rod-pin mesh together with a continuous flex $p(t)$ which fixes the boundary and the theorem follows from this.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\begin{rem}\nWe remark that one can be more liberal in the definition of a general string-node net and admit continuous strings\nwhich are nonrectifiable, as in the case of fractal curves. In the extreme case such meshes may be \\emph{uniformly nonrectifiable} in the sense that for each of the strings $\\gamma: [0,1]\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^2$ the curves $\\gamma([a,b])$ are nonrectifiable for all $a<b$.\nOne can readily construct such meshes by a process of \\emph{string interpolation}, analogous to that in the proof above.\nAlternatively we note that interesting divisible uniformly nonrectifiable meshes arise from tilings by \\emph{nonrectifiable rep-tiles}. By the latter we mean a compact set  $K$ with interior which may be tiled by congruent copies of $rK$ for some $r<1$, and  where the boundary is a non-rectifiable closed curve. The twin dragon is a well known example. See for example Vince \\cite{vin}.\nAs with the pinwheel mesh above such a \\textit{rep-tilian mesh} is constructed by unrestricted \"downward\" string additions. Note now, however, that there are no longer any string length constraints, so for vacuous reasons the twin dragon mesh (for example) is in fact locally flexible.\n\\end{rem}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Further directions}\nWe note that in an interesting 2007 thesis, E. B. Ashton \\cite{ash} introduced the subject of \\emph{continuous tensegrities} and analysed various examples and their infinitesimal and continuous rigidity. \nRecall, informally, that a finite tensegrity  can be viewed as a modified bar-joint framework $(G,p)$ in which some of the bars are replaced by strings (cables) and some of the bars are replaced by struts (incompressible bars that admit stretching). In the case of continuous tensegrities the finiteness of the graph is relaxed and continua of strings and bars are possible, as in the example below.\nThe methodologies used for these constraint systems have a number of commonalities with our discussions. However,  the consistent focus in \\cite{ash} is to obtain generalisations of the Roth-Whitely theorem \\cite{rot-whi} to the effect that a sufficient condition for infinitesimal rigidity is the existence of a positive self-stress together with the rigidity of the underlying $(G,p)$.\n\nThe following illustrative example appears in Chapter 4 of \\cite{ash}. Let the points of the unit circle about the origin in the plane provides a set of joints. Let the antipodal joints be connected by struts and define strings to connect two joints that are separated by a subarc of length $h$ units. If the string connection\ndistance is a  irrational, then the continuous tensegrity is a single\nconnected tensegrity which is infinitesimally rigid.\n\nSome methodological commonalities can also be found in the detailed analysis of the flexibility of semidiscrete frameworks and joined ribbons given by Karpenkov \\cite{kar}. In this setting a single ribbon is in effect a string-node net with a continuum of rigid strings (rods) connecting corresponding points on two continuous strings (being the boundary of the ribbon). Karpenkov has shown that such ribbons have one-dimensional configuration spaces and curious continuous motions. \n\nThe rigidity and flexibility analysis we have given in Section 6 can be viewed as the beginnings of what we see as a novel and interesting topic of geometric rigidity. As well as the fundamental problem of determining the forms of rigidity and flexibility of various meshes in dimensions $2$ and $3$, there are also natural further directions inspired in part by the discrete setting, such as the analysis of\ninfinitesimal flexibility (Badri et al \\cite{bad-et-al}),\nthe implications of symmetry (Ross et al \\cite{ros-et-al}) and the implications of boundary conditions (Theran et al \\cite{the-et-al}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{ash} E.B.

Then there is $\\delta >0$ such that $p_t$ is laminar for $0\\leq t\\leq \\delta$.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\n\nAt time $t=0$ the placement $p_t$ is the identity map and so the tangential vectors\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}p_t(x,y), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}p_t(x,y)$ are orthogonal for all $(x,y)$ in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. Since the flex is uniformly smooth it follows that there exists $\\delta >0$ such that for all $0\\leq t\\leq\\delta$ the tangential vectors\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}p_t(x,y), \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}p_t(x,y)$ are not colinear for all $(x,y)$ in $[0,1]^2$.  Thus, by the lemma, all the placements for such $t$ are laminar.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nWe remark that a literal variant of this theorem does not hold in three dimensions for the block mesh \nindicated by Figure \\ref{f:block}. Indeed,\nthe corresponding laminarity condition, defined in terms of a three-fold vector sum, might be referred to a \\emph{strong laminarity}. The reason for this, to pursue the material analogy, is that a bounded 2D mesh in a plane in ${\\mathbb{R}}^3$ admits continuous and smooth motions analogous to that of a sheet of paper, and one can repeat such motions in a parallel manner to obtain continuous flexes.\n\n\nWe consider next the triadic kagome mesh. \nRecall that the infinite periodic kagome bar-joint framework admits diverse continuous motions which are periodic in some sense. \nSee \\cite{kap-tre-tho-gue}, \\cite{owe-pow-nyjm-1} for example. We now show that in contrast to the rectangular case above, this flexibility does not carry over in any way to the triadic kagome mesh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{t:triadicrigid}\nA $C_1$-smooth placement of the triadic kagome mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$\nis congruent to the identity placement. In particular ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$  is rigid with respect to $C_1$-smooth flexes.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nIt will be sufficient to show that any $C_1$-smooth placement of \n${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$ is congruent to the identity placement of ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm kag}$. \nNote that such a placement, $p_t$ say, has a\nunique continuous extension of $p_t: {\\mathbb{R}}^2\\to {\\mathbb{R}}^2$. Moreover, a restriction of this extension defines a string length preserving placement of the containing triadic triangular mesh, ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}$. It suffices then to show that the $C_1$-smooth  mesh ${\\mathcal{M}} = p_t({\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri})$, defined by the range of this  placement, is congruent to ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}$.\n\nLet  $0<t<1$ and let $q_0$ be a node of the mesh ${\\mathcal{M}}$.  By the  $C_1$-smoothness of the strings of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ there are $3$ three unit tangent vectors to the three  strings through $q_0$, say $a_1, a_2, a_3$. We may choose these vectors so that the vectors $a_1, a_2, a_3, -a_1, -a_2, -a_3$ correspond to a consecutive sequence of points on the unit circle, with the angles between $a_1, a_2$ and between $a_2, a_3$ acute angles. \nWe claim that all the consecutive angles are equal to $\\pi/3$. To see this it is sufficient to note that no consecutive angle is greater than $\\pi/3$. We now  show that this follows from the string length preservation property applied to cross-strings connecting nodes on adjacent strings through $q_0$. \n\nLet $q_0'$ be the node in ${\\mathcal{M}}_{\\rm tri}$ which is the preimage of $q_0$ under $p_t$, and let $q_1'$ and $q_2'$ be nodes on adjacent strings through $q_0'$ which lie on a common cross string.\nThe internodal string lengths agree with the Euclidean distances, $\\|q_1' - q_2'\\|, \\|q_1'-q_0'\\|$ and $\\|q_2'-q_0'\\|$ respectively, and these lengths are equal. \nLet $q_1, q_2$ be the images of $q_1', q_2'$ under $p_t$. Since $p_t$ preserves string lengths we have $d_{01}=d_{12}=d_{02}$ where $d_{ij}$ is the string distance between $q_i$ and $q_j$ for the (unique) string $l_{ij}$ of ${\\mathcal{M}}$ through $q_i, q_j$.\n\nSuppose now, by way of contradiction, that angle between the tangent vectors at $q_0$ for the strings $l_{01}$ and $l_{02}$ is greater than $\\pi/3$. Then \n\\medskip\n\n\n(i) the ratio $\\|q_1-q_2\\|/\\|q_1-q_0\\|$ has a finite  limit  greater than $1$ as $q_1$ tends to $q_0$.\n\\medskip\n\nAlso, by string length preservation,\n\\medskip\n\n(ii) the ratio $d_{01}/\\|q_1-q_0\\|$ has limit $1$, as $q_1$ tends to $q_0$,\n\\medskip\n\nand, by the triangle inequality,\n\\medskip\n\n(iii)   $d_{12}$  is not less than $\\|q_1-q_2\\|$.\n\\medskip\n\n\\medskip\n\nCombining the above it follows that if  $q_1$ is sufficiently close to $q_0$ then\n", "index": 37, "text": "\n\\[\n\\frac{d_{12}}{d_{01}} = \n\\frac{d_{12}}{\\|q_1-q_2\\|}\n\\frac{\\|q_1-q_2\\|}{\\|q_1-q_0\\|}\n\\frac{\\|q_1-q_0\\|}{d_{01}} >1\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex18.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{d_{12}}{d_{01}}=\\frac{d_{12}}{\\|q_{1}-q_{2}\\|}\\frac{\\|q_{1}-q_{2}\\|}{\\|q%&#10;_{1}-q_{0}\\|}\\frac{\\|q_{1}-q_{0}\\|}{d_{01}}&gt;1\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>d</mi><mn>12</mn></msub><msub><mi>d</mi><mn>01</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>d</mi><mn>12</mn></msub><mrow><mo>\u2225</mo><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>\u2225</mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2225</mo><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mo>\u2225</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2225</mo><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo>\u2225</mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2225</mo><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>q</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo>\u2225</mo></mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mn>01</mn></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
