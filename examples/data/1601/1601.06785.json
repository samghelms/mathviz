During the\noutbursts they show luminosities of the order of $1-30\\%$ of the\nEddington luminosity, $L_{\\rm Edd}$ \\citep{maccarone+03,mcclintock+06}. According to the standard disk\ntheory \\citep{ss73}, such luminosities correspond to the radiation-pressure\ndominated, radiatively efficient disk state. X-ray binaries can\nremain in such a configuration for months, i.e., for the time \nmuch longer than the relevant dynamical, thermal, or even viscous\ntimescales. However, radiation-pressure dominated thin disks are\nknown to be viscously \\citep{lightmaneardley-74} and thermally\n\\citep{ss76} unstable. \n\n\n\n\nIf such instabilities\noperate, one should expect global limit\ncycle bahavior \\citep{lasotapelat-91,szuszkiewiczmiller-98}\\footnote{Which may be resposible\n  for some of the variability patterns of the outliers in the X-ray binary set\n  -- GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624.}, instead of the observed\nquasi-steady high/soft\nstate of most BH X-ray binaries. The disagreement strongly\nsuggests that our understanding of the physics of thin disk accretion\nis not satisfactory.\n\nAccretion flows are known to be turbulent. Because of this fact the\nvalue of analytical\nmodeling is limited and numerical simulations are required for better\nunderstanding them. Recently,\nsignificant progress has been made through\ndevelopment of sophisticated magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) and radiation\nMHD (RMHD) codes capable of simulating accretion flows both in the shearing\nbox approximation and in the global context. The application of the latter has so far\nbeen limited to studying geometrically thick accretion disks\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{ohsuga11,sadowski+dynamo,mckinney+harmrad,jiang+3dsim} which are\nknown (the optically thick ones) to be stabilized by advection-related\ncooling \\citep{abra88}. The only insight into the physics of geometrically thin,\nradiation-pressure dominated and presumably unstable accretion flows\nhas come so far from shearing box simulations. Most recently,\n\\cite{jiang+stability} studied such systems (with zero net magnetic\nflux) using a sophisticated\nradiation MHD algorithm and have shown that they are indeed unstable,\nin disagreement with most of the observed systems.\n\nWhat does stabilize the astrophysical thin disks? A wide range of ideas has been\nproposed, including stabilization by stochastic variability\n\\citep{janiukmisra-12}, intrinsic delay between heating and cooling\n\\citep{hirose+09,ciesielski+12}, and magnetic fields. The latter seem\nto be most promising as magnetic fields are intrinsically involved in every\naccretion event (they make the disks turbulent), and probably are also crucial\nin explaining the observed nature of state\ntransitions \\citep{begelmanarmitage-14}. \n\n\n\\cite{begelmanpringle-07} claimed that optically thick, geometrically\nthin accretion disks with strong toroidal magnetic field are stable\nagainst thermal and viscous instabilities. The authors based on the\nassumption that the field strength for a thin disk saturates at the\nlevel derived by \\cite{pessahpsaltis-05}, i.e., when the Alfven speed\nroughly equals the geometric mean of the Keplerian speed and the speed\nof sound in gas. We do not find this condition satisfied in the\nsimulated thin disks presented in this work. \\cite{oda+09} discussed the stabilizing effect\nof strong toroidal magnetic field on thermal stability of optically\nthin and thick accretion disks using analytical approach and an ad\nhoc, although physically motivated, prescription for the radial\ndistribution of the magnetic flux. Our work essentially validates\ntheir assumptions and conclusions. Recently, \\cite{libegelman-14} have shown that magnetic\nfields may help stabilize the disk also through magnetically\ndriven outflows which decrease the disk temperature and thus help the\ndisk become more stable at a given accretion rate.\n\nIn this work we show that indeed, magnetically supported thin disks\nare stable against thermal instability. We perform two\nthree-dimensional global simulations of radiative, sub-Eddington accretion\nflows using a state-of-the-art general relativistic RMHD code. The\nsimulated accretion flows led to strongly and weakly magnetized states. Only the\nformer reached thermal equilibrium. The latter showed significant\nand consistent excess of cooling.\nOur work should be considered as a proof of principle. More\nnumerical effort is necessary to understand the properties of the\nmagnetically supported accretion disks accross the spectrum of\naccretion rates and large scale properties of  magnetic field.\n\nOur work is organized as follows. In Section~\\ref{s.magnstable} we\nshow with a simple argument that magnetically supported disks are\nthermally stable. In Section~\\ref{s.method} we present the numerical\nmethods we applied and the initial conditions for the simulations we\nperformed. In Section~\\ref{s.accretion} we discuss the differences in\nthe ultimate magnetic field configuration. In\nSection~\\ref{s.heatingcooling} we compute and compare rates of heating\nand cooling. The collapse of the weakly magnetized disk is discussed\nin Section~\\ref{s.collapse}. The properties of the stable solution are\npresented in Sections~\\ref{s.properties} and\n\\ref{s.energetics}, and are followed by Discussion and Summary.\n\n\nIn this work we adopt the following definition\nfor the Eddington mass accretion rate,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{e.medd}\n{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}} = \\frac{L_{\\rm Edd}}{\\eta c^2},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}}=\\frac{L_{\\rm Edd}}{\\eta c^{2}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>M</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mi>Edd</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>Edd</mi></msub><mrow><mi>\u03b7</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06785.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the standard viscosity parameter, $\\Omega_{\\rm K}$\nis the Keplerian angular velocity, $h$ is disk thickness, and $P$ and $p$ denote vertically\nintegrated and central pressures, respectively.

The gas is coupled to radiation through the radiation\nfour-force describing the energy and momentum exchange through\nabsorption and scattering. We use the basic thermal\nComptonization as described in \\cite{sadowski+dynamo}. We evolve four\nquantities describing the radiation field, corresponding to the\nradiative energy density\nand momentum. The radiation\nstress-energy tensor is closed using the M1 closure\n\\citep{levermore84, sadowski+koral}. In addition, we use the radiative\nviscosity prescription given in the Appendix of\n\\cite{sadowski+dynamo}. We adopted the following formulae for the\nabsorption and scattering opacities, $\\kappa_{\\rm abs}$ and\n$\\kappa_{\\rm es}$, respectively,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hspace{1cm}\\kappa_{\\rm abs}&=&6.4\\times 10^{22} \\rho T^{-7/2}\\,\\rm cm^2/g,\\\\\n\\hspace{1cm}\\kappa_{\\rm es}&=&0.34 \\,\\rm cm^2/g.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\noindent We adopt the Kerr-Shield metric and the\nradial cells are distributed exponentially in radius, with the\ninnermost five cells located inside the BH horizon. The polar cells are\nconcentrated towards the equatorial plane to provide higher resolution\nin the disk region (the effective vertical resolution for simulations\npresented here, calculated basing on the vertical cell size at the\nequatorial plane, is $N_{\\theta,\\rm eff}=1250$). The azimuthal cells are distributed uniformly. \n\n\\subsection{Initial state and simulation sequence}\n\\label{s.initial}\n\n\nSimulating radiation pressure dominated, geometrically thin accretion\ndisks requires careful choice of initial conditions. One can easily\nimagine that if the initial state is too\nfar from the equilibrium solution, one may ``overshoot'' and instead\nof finding the intended solution at the middle, presumably unstable branch of the\ntemperature-surface density diagram \\citep[the so-called\nS-curve,][]{abra88}, one may find a solution at the lower, gas-pressure dominated\nbranch corresponding to lower accretion rates, or at the upper,\nadvection-dominated branch. \n\nThe standard way of initializing simulations of accretion disks is to\nstart from an equilibrium torus of gas threaded by weak poloidal\nmagnetic field. As a result of magnetorotational instability\n\\citep[MRI, ][]{balbushawley-mri} this magnetic field triggers\nturbulence  and the related dissipative heating. Using the\nsame setup for simulating thin disks may be problematic. Firstly,\nthe initial torus may contaminate the most interesting inner region of\nthe disk by, e.g., blocking radiation coming from that region. Secondly, if\none starts from a thin, radiation pressure supported torus of low\noptical depth, the torus may cool significantly (on the\nthermal timescale, $t_{\\rm th}\\approx 1/\\alpha \\Omega$) by the\ntime the turbulence triggers in (on the dynamical timescale, $t_{\\rm\n  dyn}\\approx 1/\\Omega$), especially for large viscosity $\\alpha$\nparameters, typical for inner regions of accretion \\citep{penna+alpha}.\n\nWe decided to follow a different approach. We start from a relatively\noptically thick torus\nlocated far from the BH. We evolve\nthat torus in axisymmetry to let the gas reach the innermost region\nand start crossing the BH horizon. Then, the gas, magnetic field and\nradiation are rewritten onto a three-dimensional grid. The simulation\nis continued in three-dimensions and gives mildly super-Eddington\nsolution. Then, in the second step, the gas density and magnetic field\nare scaled down by constant factors keeping fixed the gas temperature\nand magnetic to gas pressure ratio. As a result, we start the ultimate\nsimulation from a state which is already turbulent and presumably\nclose to the equilibrium corresponding to a sub-Eddington accretion flow.\n\nWe have simulated three models, the parameters of which are specified in\nTable~\\ref{t.models}. Two fiducial simulations (\\texttt{Q} and\n\\texttt{D}) were initiated with the same torus but with different configurations of magnetic\nfield (discussed below) and both were evolved in three dimensions \nwith the azimuthal wedge limited, for the sake of computational cost,\nto $\\pi/2$. The third simulation, \\texttt{Q}$(2\\pi)$, was performed with the full $2\\pi$\nwedge, ran for a limited time, and have shown very similar properties\nto simulation \\texttt{Q}. For this reason, we will compare only\nsimulations \\texttt{Q} and\n\\texttt{D} below.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Model parameters}\n\\label{t.models}\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccc}\n\\hline\n\\hline\nName \n& $\\dot M_{\\rm BH}/\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$ &\n$\\Delta t$ &  $\\Delta\\phi$ & \n$N_r\\times N_\\theta \\times N_\\phi$ & $B_{\\rm init}$\\\\\n\\hline\n\\texttt{Q} & $0.82$ & $20000{t_{\\rm g}}$ &\n$\\pi/2$ & $320 \\times 320 \\times 32$ & quad.\\\\\n\\texttt{Q($2\\pi$)}& $0.80$ & $5000{t_{\\rm g}}$ &\n$2\\pi$ & $320 \\times 320 \\times 128$ & quad.\\\\\n\\texttt{D} & $1\\searrow$ & $9200{t_{\\rm g}}$ &\n$\\pi/2$ & $320 \\times 320 \\times 32$ & dipolar\\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{$\\dot M_{\\rm BH}$ - average accretion rate through the BH horizon,}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{$\\Delta t$ - duration of the simiulation, $\\Delta\n  \\phi$ - wedge in azimuth,}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{$N_r\\times N_\\theta \\times N_\\phi$ - resolution in\n  radius, polar and azimuthal angles,}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{$B_{\\rm init}$ - configuration of the initial\n  magnetic field.}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{Other parameters: $M_{\\rm BH}=10M_\\odot$,\n  $a_*=0$, $r_{\\rm in}=1.85$,$r_{\\rm out}=500$,}\\\\\n\\multicolumn{6}{l}{effective resolution in\n  polar angle at the equatorial plane, $N_{\\theta,\\,\\rm eff}=1250$. }\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Initial magnetic field}\n\nIn Section~\\ref{s.magnstable} we argued that a thin, radiatively\nefficient accretion disk with radiation pressure dominating over gas\npressure is thermally stable if magnetic pressure overcomes the\nradiation pressure and provides most of the pressure\nsupport. Such conditions are not satisfied in the standard\nsaturation state of magnetorotational instability (MRI). Sophisticated\nsimulations of shearing boxes have shown that the typical\nmagnetic to total pressure ratio is only $10\\%$ \\citep[e.g.,][]{davis+10,shi+10}. This\nnumber increases for simulations with non-zero net vertical magnetic\nflux. For sufficiently strong fluxes the entire shearing box may\nbecome magnetically dominated \\citep{xuening+13}.\n\nSimulations of accretion flows in the shearing box approximation do not allow for\nradial advection of heat or magnetic field. They also neglect the\ncurvature terms (the characteristic radius is infinity). What is more,\none cannot start a simulation with a non-zero radial flux of magnetic\nfield -- the shear converts the radial component of magnetic field into azimuthal one and\nleads to unlimited grow of the magnetic field. Such a behavior,\nhowever, does not have to occur in a global simulation, where the growing\nmagnetic field can be advected or escape from the disk.\n\nIn this work we aim at comparing properties of strongly and weakly\nmagnetized thin accretion disks.\nHaving in mind that the large scale configuration of the magnetic\nfield has an impact on the level of magnetic field saturation, we\ndecided to test two initial topologies of the magnetic field shown in\nthe left panels of Fig.~\\ref{f.Bfield}. The top sub-panel shows the\ninitial quadrupolar configuration for models \\texttt{Q} and \\texttt{Q}$(2\\pi)$. The bottom\nsub-panel shows the dipolar topology used to initialize model\n\\texttt{D}. In both cases the magnetic field was normalized not to\nexceed $p_{\\rm mag}/p_{\\rm gas}=1/20$ in the domain. We stress here\nthat little is known about large scale magnetic fields in accretion\nflows and both configurations must be somewhat arbitrary.\n\n In the global\nsense both topologies have zero net-flux of magnetic field - the\nloops are contained in the torus and in the computational\ndomain. However, as accretion proceeds, one may expect that portions\nof the torus located at different radii will approximately proceed in\norder towards the\nBH. According to this picture, the quadrupolar topology would\ncorrespond to zero net vertical flux, in contrast to the dipolar\ntopology where the vertical field does not cancel out at given\nradius.\n\n For both configurations the net radial flux at given radius is\nzero. However, the two are not identical in this aspect. The\nquadrupolar topology is asymmetric -- the positive radial magnetic\nfield is located near the equatorial plane and the negative field\nnear the torus surface. If only the latter escapes the bulk\nof the disk, e.g., buoyantly or dragged by outflowing gas, then one may expect\nnon-zero radial net flux left in the disk. Similar effect would take\nplace if the clock- and counter-clockwise loops are not advected in\nparallel -- one of the loops may dominate the inner region but the\npresence of the other one would make the first asymmetric with respect\nto the equatorial plane.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.025\\columnwidth]{Bfieldinit_phi.png}\\vspace{-.2cm}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.025\\columnwidth]{Bfieldend_phi.png}\n \\caption{Left panels: Initial configuration of density and the magnetic field in\n   simulations \\texttt{Q} (top) and \\texttt{D} (bottom panel).

Simulation \\texttt{Q}\n(blue line) accreted at relatively steady state with average\naccretion rate of ca. $0.8{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}$. The inflow/outflow\nequilibrium, i.e., the region where the accretion rate is constant,\nextended in this case to $r\\approx15{r_{\\rm g}}$. The other simulation,\n\\texttt{D} (red line), did\nnot show a steady state -- the accretion rate fell down initially from\n$\\sim 1{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}$ to $\\sim 0.2{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}$  as a result of unbalanced cooling of\nthe disk. The related collapse, discussed below, led to\nunder-resolving the MRI near the equatorial plane. The initial\ndecrease of the accretion rate was followed by an increase and\nreturn to the original rate $\\sim {\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}$. However, the\nunder-resolved equatorial region makes this stage of the simulation unreliable.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth]{mdots.png}\n  \\caption{The history of accretion rate through the BH horizon for\n    the thin disk simulations. The weakly magnetized simulation\n    \\texttt{D} became under-resolved after ca. $2000{t_{\\rm g}}$.\n  }\n \\label{f.mdots}\n\\end{figure}\n\nRight panels of Fig.~\\ref{f.Bfield} show the average configuration of\nthe magnetic field in the saturated state of simulation \\texttt{Q}\n(top) and in the decline phase of simulation\n\\texttt{D} (bottom sub-panel). There is a qualitative difference between the two. The latter,\ninitiated with a dipolar magnetic field, led to magnetic field\nroughly symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. Some amount of\nmagnetic flux has accumulated at the BH and the bulk of the disk is\nthreaded by mostly vertical net magnetic field. There is no\nsignificant radial component present. \n\nIt is not the case for the simulation initiated with the quadrupolar\nfield (\\texttt{Q}, top sub-panel). One of the set of loops (the\ncounter-clockwise) preceeded the other and dominated the innermost\nregion. However, it did not form a symmetric configuration like in\nthe other case -- the positive radial magnetic field covers larger\nvolume and, in particular, dominates in the bulk of the disk. The\nmagnetic pressure corresponding to the net radial component amounts to\n$\\sim 0.0015$ of the total pressure at radius $\\sim 15{r_{\\rm g}}$.\n\nAs discussed before, non-zero radial magnetic flux in a shearing flow\nleads to a rapid grow of the azimuthal component and, as a result, of the\nmagnetic pressure. Fig.~\\ref{f.betas} compares the magnetic pressure\ncontribution to the total pressure between the simulations. Simulation\n\\texttt{D}, which did not develop significant radial flux, shows\nmagnetic pressure contributing to ca. $10\\%$ of the total pressure for\n$r\\gtrsim10{r_{\\rm g}}$, in\nagreement with the standard MRI saturation state. The other model,\nhowever, the one with non-zero net radial flux of magnetic field in the\ndisk, has much different properties -- the magnetic pressure grows so\nmuch that it dominates the pressure budget. Near the edge of the\ninflow/outflow equilibrium ($r\\approx 15{r_{\\rm g}}$) the magnetic field provides\n$60\\%$ of the total pressure. The quadrupolar initial\nconfiguration of magnetic field led to the magnetically supported disk\nstate \\citep[compare][]{machida+06}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth]{betas_disk.png}\n \\caption{\nThe ratio of magnetic to total pressures averaged within the disk density\nscaleheight for models \\texttt{Q} and \\texttt{D} corresponding respectively to $t=5000\\div20000 {t_{\\rm g}}$ and\n   $t=2500\\div7500 {t_{\\rm g}}$. Significant net radial magnetic flux in the disk results in magnetically supported accretion. \n  }\n \\label{f.betas}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Heating and cooling}\n\\label{s.heatingcooling}\n\nThe qualitative difference in the accretion rate history suggests that\nonly the strongly magnetized disk (model \\texttt{Q}) can maintain the\nsub-Eddington state. In this section we study the balance between\nheating and cooling in the simulations.\n\nCalculating the two is trivial for the simulations of accretion disks\nin a shearing box where the gas is confined to the box and one may\nstudy the evolution of the heat content in the same volume of gas for\na long time \\citep{jiang+stability}. It is no longer straightforward in global\nsimulations such as discussed in this work. The reason is that the gas\ndoes not stay in one location but moves in a turbulent way inward. \n\nIt may seem that following the same parcel of gas along its way\ntowards the BH is the best approach to calculate heating and cooling in\na global simulation and we apply it below (Section~\\ref{s.lagrangian}). However,\nthe heating and cooling rates depend on the location, and, for\nsimulations with limited range of inflow/outflow equilibrium, one\ncan follow the gas no longer than its inflow time.\n\nAnother approach is to study the gas properties at fixed radius. In\nthis way one may expect fixed heating and cooling rates, but one also\nhas to deal with different parcels of gas crossing a given radius at\na given time. Only if the system is in equilibrium, i.e., the average accretion\nrate and disk properties do not change with time, one may say that at\nfixed radius one probes different random (turbulent) realizations of\nthe same averaged state. We apply this method below as well\n(Section~\\ref{s.eulerian}).\n\nTo study the heating and cooling rates we define a ``box'' enclosed by\ntwo radial boundaries and the vertical boundary at the polar angle \n$\\theta=55^\\circ$ (simulation \\texttt{Q}) and $\\theta=65^\\circ$ (\\texttt{D}), corresponding to the approximate locations of the\nphotosphere in the respective simulations (see the topmost panel\nof Fig.~\\ref{f.phisli} for the photosphere location in model \\texttt{Q}), and covering\nthe full azimuthal extent of a given simulation. The cooling rate is\ndefined as the rate at which radiative flux crosses the vertical\nboundaries of the box. The heating rate is estimated by calculating\nthe rate at which gas transfers energy to the radiation field, i.e.,\nby integrating the time component of the radiative four-fource, $G_t$\n(turbulent dissipation increases internal energy of the gas, but gas\nimmediately releases photons to maintain local thermal \nequilibrium\\footnote{What would not be the case for optically thin\n  disks.}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Eulerian picture}\n\n\\label{s.eulerian}\n\\begin{figure}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.05\\columnwidth]{Qs_vs_time_fixed_rad217b_3d_r1416.png}\\hspace{-.5cm}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.05\\columnwidth]{Qs_vs_time_fixed_rad229b_3d_r1012.png}\n \\caption{Heating ($Q^+$, orange lines) and cooling ($Q^-$, blue\n   lines) as a function of time calculated at $r\\approx 15{r_{\\rm g}}$ and $r\\approx 11{r_{\\rm g}}$ for\n   the stable simulation $\\texttt{Q}$ (top) and the unstable\n   simulation $\\texttt{D}$ (bottom panel), respectively.

Colors of the markers\n   denote the magnetic to total pressure ratio.\n  }\n \\label{f.qplusqminus}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nWe start studying heating and cooling by calculating the respective rates\nat a fixed location. The radial boundaries of the boxes were set at\n$r=14{r_{\\rm g}}$ and $16{r_{\\rm g}}$ for simulation \\texttt{Q} and at $r=10{r_{\\rm g}}$ and\n$11{r_{\\rm g}}$ for simulation \\texttt{D} (the choice was motivated by the\ncondition that the boxes are inside the inflow/outflow equilibrium\nregion and far enough from the BH so that the effect of radial\nadvection of heat is negligible).\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{f.qplusqminus_vstime} shows the heating and cooling rates\ncalculated at these locations for model \\texttt{Q} (top) and\n\\texttt{D} (bottom panel) as a function of time. For the former, the cooling rate follows\nthe viscous heating rate closely throughout the simulation and on\naverage corresponds to the rate predicted by the standard thin disk\nmodel for accretion rate $0.8{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}$. The magnetic contribution to\nthe total pressure stays in this case at the level of\n$60\\%$. The behavior of the weakly magnetized simulation \\texttt{D}\n(bottom panel) is\nqualitatively diffferent. From the beginning the cooling rate\nsignificantly exceeds the heating rate. As a result, the disk cools down, \ncollapses towards the equatorial plane, and the MRI becomes\nunder-resolved at the equatorial plane for $t\\gtrsim2000{t_{\\rm g}}$ (the\ncorresponding $Q^\\theta$ parameter drops below $10$, see\n\\cite{hawley+13}). Because of cooling dominating over heating, the\nthermal and radiation pressures keep decreasing, and ultimately (for\n$t\\gtrsim 8000{t_{\\rm g}}$), the magnetic pressure dominates the total\npressure. Whether such a\nstate can be maintained by itself will have to be verified numerically\nin a separate, higher resolution, study. \n\n\nFigure~\\ref{f.qplusqminus} shows the heating/cooling rates as a\nfunction of the (averaged over volume) radiation pressure for\nthe stable, strongly magnetized model \\texttt{Q} (left panel) and the\ncollapsing model \\texttt{D} (right panel). Two sets of markers are\nplotted. The grey markers show the radiative cooling rates. The other\nset of markers shows the heating rates and their colors denote the time\nwhen they were calculated. For the magnetically supported disk (left\npanel) the heating and cooling rates virtually overlap each other\nproving the thermal equilibrium of the disk. There is no clear\ntemporal \ntrend, i.e., the radiation pressure stays close to $3-4\\times\n10^{14} \\,\\rm erg/cm^3$ at all times. It is also evident that the rate of\nradiative cooling is proportional to the radiation pressure,\nconsistent with the diffusive radiation transfer. Similar\ndependence is shown by the rate of viscous dissipation,\nin reasonable agreement with Eq.~\\ref{e.dQdp}, which for $\\beta'=0.6$ predicts\nthermally stable \nslope of $s=0.8$.\n\nThe right panel shows the same quantities for simulation\n\\texttt{D}. In this case there is no equilibrium state -- the\naccretion rate changes significantly with time and the gas crossing\ngiven box is not expected to show consistent properties. This is\nindeed the case. As noticed before, the cooling rate exceeds the\nheating rate as long as the magnetization is low, i.e.,\n$\\beta'\\lesssim 0.5$. The radiation pressure initially drops down\nconsistently with time showing once again that the disk was out of\nthermal equilibrium. It stabilizes around $10^{14}\\,\\rm erg/cm^3$ only\nin the late ($t\\gtrsim 11000{t_{\\rm g}}$), strongly magnetized, but\nunderresolved stage.\n\n\n\\subsection{Lagrangian picture}\n\\label{s.lagrangian}\n\nWe now study the heating/cooling balance by following the\ngas on its way towards the BH inside the inflow/outflow\nequilibrium region. Because such an equilibrium has not been reached for\nsimulation \\texttt{D}, we limit ourselves here to \nthe stable simulation \\texttt{Q}. We first approximate the average radial\nvelocity of the flow between radii $r=6{r_{\\rm g}}$ and $20{r_{\\rm g}}$ and get $v_{\\texttt{Q}}=\n-3(r/{r_{\\rm g}})^{-2.5}$. Then, we ``drop'' a box, initially located between\n$r=19{r_{\\rm g}}$ and $20{r_{\\rm g}}$, and calculate the heating/cooling rates on its\nway towards the BH.\n\nFigure~\\ref{f.Qsvstime} shows the radiative cooling (blue\nline) and viscous heating (orange line) rates as a function of time\nand the corresponding location of the box (denoted with the black\nline labeled on the right) for the stable simulation \\texttt{Q}.\n The profiles were obtained by averaging the\nproperties of five separate boxes ``dropped'' at different times.\nThe dashed line shows the emission profile\npredicted by the thin disk model for $0.8{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}$ at the location\ncorresponding to the center of the box.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.05\\columnwidth]{Qs_vs_time_rad217b_3d_movN.png}\n \n \\caption{ Heating (orange) and cooling rates (blue lines) in a box\n   infalling with the average radial velocity of the gas for\n   simulation \\texttt{Q}. The radial boundaries of the box were\n   initially located at $r=19{r_{\\rm g}}$ and $20{r_{\\rm g}}$. The thin black lines\n   show their location as a function of time.  }\n \\label{f.Qsvstime}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe simulated disk shows exact balance between heating\nang cooling in the initial stage of the box infall -- this indicates\nthat the disk is radiatively efficient, i.e., all the generated heat\nis taken away from the disk by radiation. At the same time the disk\nneither cools nor heats up, but maintains the equilibrium state it\nhas reached. When the inner boundary of the box is located inside\n$r\\approx 11{r_{\\rm g}}$ (what happens roughly after $t=2200{r_{\\rm g}}$), the rate of\nviscous heating starts to exceed the rate of radiative cooling\n(calculated by integrating radiative flux over the vertical\nboundaries). However, most of the excess heat is ultimately deposited on the BH as a\nresult of both strong collimation of the radiation  (which\nwas emitted in gas moving with relativistic velocity towards the BH\nand crosses the inner radial box boundary, instead of escaping vertically)\nand photon trapping. The rate of radiative cooling, i.e., the rate at\nwhich radiation escapes from the system, follows closely the\nprediction of the standard model (denoted with the dashed line).\n\n\n\\section{Collapsing, weakly-magnetized disk}\n\\label{s.collapse}\n\nFigure~\\ref{f.collapse} compares the evolution of the two models over time. The\nleft set of panels shows the magnetically supported disk. It maintains\nits thickness and properties throughout the simulation. The right\npanels reflect the evolution of the weakly magnetized disk which\nchanges its properties on a relatively short (thermal) timescale. Because of the\nexcess of cooling over heating, the disk loses its radiation pressure\nsupport and gas collapses towards the equatorial plane. The density\nand the amount of gas in\nthat region increase, and the MRI becomes under-resolved.\n\nBecause of the cooling rate initially significantly exceeding the\nheating rate, the radiative content of the collapsing disk decreases\nand the magnetic field (dominated by the toroidal component \npreserved during the collapse) becomes more and more significant \\citep{machida+06}. We\nindeed observe that the latest stages of the evolution of model\n\\texttt{Q} become magnetic pressure supported\n(Fig.~\\ref{f.qplusqminus_vstime}). However, limited resolution of our\nsimulation does not allow us to study this state in detail. It is an open\nquestion whethere the disk manages to stay in such strongly magnetized\n(and therefore stable) state, despite the fact that there was hardly any net radial\nflux of magnetic field before the collapse, or rather the limit-cycle\nbehavior \\citep{lasotapelat-91,szuszkiewiczmiller-98} of the accretion flow leading to strongly varying accretion\nrate (and luminosity) on timescales of the order of hours ($1h\\approx\n10^8{t_{\\rm g}}$) occurs.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.05\\columnwidth]{rho_collapse.png}\\vspace{-.2cm}\n  \\caption{Time evolution of the strongly (model\n    \\texttt{Q}, left panels) and weakly (model \\texttt{D}, right\n    panels) magnetized disks.

We note, however, that the\nsolution we obtained is not unique. We suspect that the exact\nproperties of the disk will depend on the large-scale properties of\nthe magnetic field. Our simulation started with an arbitrary magnetic\nfield setup and evolved into a strongly magnetized state which proves\nthe concept, but does not have to be typical for the magnetically supported mode of accretion.\nFurther numerical work is necessary to get more understanding of such\naccretion flows.\n\nFigure~\\ref{f.phisli} presents a number of disk properties on the\npoloidal plane basing on the\naveraged (left) and snapshot (right halves of the panels) data. The\nfirst panel from the top shows the distribution of gas density, $\\rho$ (colors),\ntogether with the photosphere location (with respect to the total\nopacity, solid lines) and\nthe density scaleheight, $h=\\sqrt{\\int \\rho z^2 {\\rm d}z/\\int \\rho\n  {\\rm d}z}$ (dashed lines). The gas is clearly turbulent and only\nmoderately concentrated at the equatorial plane. Although the\nscaleheight is not large ($h/r\\approx 0.15$), the photosphere is\nquite far from the equatorial plane. Such a density distribution\nresults from the fact that the magnetic pressure\nprovides support against vertical gravity and prevents\nsignificant compression of gas at the equatorial plane.\n\nThe second panel shows the gas temperature, $T_{\\rm gas}$. Near the equatorial plane,\nthe gas is roughly at $10^{7.5}K$ in the whole inner region. Much\nhigher temperatures are near the axis where the density is the lowest,\nand magnetization is the\nlargest. The distribution of temperature shows a slight\nassymetry caused by the assymetric distribution of net magnetic field\n(compare Fig.~\\ref{f.Bfield}).\n\nThe third panel shows the energy density in the radiation field\nmeasured in the comoving frame of gas, $\\widehat E$ -- a quantity that in optically thick gas\nreflects distribution of the radiation pressure \n\nThe fourth panel shows the magnetic to total pressure ratio,\n$\\beta'$. The whole inner region is dominated by the\nmagnetic pressure. Even at the equatorial plane, where the radiation\npressure is largest, magnetic pressure\ndominates the pressure balace. Near the scaleheight, but still below\nthe photosphere, the magnetic pressure contributes to 70-80\\% of the\ntotal pressure. Once again, the assymetry in the polar region\nis visible.\n\nThe fifth panel shows the radiation to gas pressure ratio, $\\beta_{\\rm\n  rad}$. The radiation pressure itself overwhelmes the thermal\npressure of  gas by roughly three orders of magnitude in the whole\ndomain.\n\nThe sixth panel shows the viscous heating rate, equal to the photon\ngeneration rate, $\\widehat G^t$. On average, it is positive and\nreflects energy transfer from heated gas to the radiation field. The\ndissipation takes place throughout the disk volume, and not only at\nthe equatorial plane, with significant amount of energy released just\nbelow the photosphere and close to the BH horizon.\n\nThe seventh panel reflects the velocity field of the disk. On average,\nthe gas approaches the BH at all polar angles, even in the polar\nregion (what would presumably change if the BH was rotating and could\nproduce, even moderate, jet). The gas moves on average with the lowest velocity near the\nequatorial plane. The surface layers fall on the BH with noticeably\nlarger velocity. As a result, the accretion is not limited to the most dense\nequatorial region, but the surface layers bring inward comparable amount of\ngas.\n\nThe eight panel (second from the bottom) shows the average and\ntemporal magnetic field. The average properties have alredy been\ndiscussed in context of Fig.~\\ref{f.Bfield}. The magnetic field is\nnot symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane -- magnetic\npressure is higher in the upper polar funnel and the net radial flux\nin most of the disk is positive, causing significant growth of the\nmagnetic field and ultimately leading to the magnetically supported\nstate.\n\nThe bottommost panel in Fig.~\\ref{f.phisli} shows the properties of\nthe radiation field. Colors denote the magnitude of the local\nradiation flux and vectors show its direction. For $r\\gtrsim 10{r_{\\rm g}}$\nthe radiation diffuses out of the disk in the direction roughly\nperpendicular to the photosphere. Inside that radius, there is\nsignificant component of radiation flux pointing towards the BH --\nthese are the photons which are either trapped in the optically thick\ngas or were emitted, and therefore collimated, by gas\nrushing towards the horizon. The radiation flux has the largest magnitude\ninside the innermost stable orbit (ISCO) due to the strong\ndissipation there (compare the sixth panel), but all that radiation\nends up ultimately under the horizon.\n\n\\section{Luminosity and energy flows in the stable solution}\n\\label{s.energetics}\n\nWe now briefly discuss energy flow in the magnetically supported,\nsub-Eddington disk, basing on previously discussed in detail model\n\\texttt{Q}. We will follow closely the approach developed in\n\\cite{sadowski+enfluxes}. The total flux of energy is decomposed into\nthe binding, radiative and viscous fluxes. Binding energy is\ntransported with the gas which approaches the BH on roughly Keplerian orbits and\nliberates its own binding energy (the sum of gravitational and\nkinetic energies). Radiative energy is transported\neither outward by free streaming photons escaping the system, or\ninward by\nphotons trapped in optically thick gas or collimated towards the BH. Viscous energy transport results from{\nthe effective viscosity transferring rotational energy between\nadjacent disk annuli. In a steady state, the three sum up to\nthe total, independent of radius, energy extracted from the system. In\nthe standard thin disk model, this total energy (or luminosity) \nequals to the (minus) binding energy of the gas crossing the horizon and, at the\nsame time, to the radiative luminosity of the system as seen from\ninfinity, i.e., to $5.7\\%\\,\\dot Mc^2$ for a non-rotating BH ($5.7\\,\\%$ is\nthe radiative efficiency of the system).\n\nFigure~\\ref{f.enfluxes} shows such a decomposition of the total energy\nflux for simulation \\texttt{Q} based on time and azimuth averaged data. The total energy, denoted by the thick\nsolid red line, is constant to $10\\%$ within $r\\approx 20{r_{\\rm g}}$ (the\ndeparture from a constant value suggests that the properties of the disk\nchange a bit with time). The total luminosity of the system is very\nclose to the thin disk luminosity (denoted by the red dashed line),\nand equals $5.5\\pm0.5\\%\\,\\dot M c^2$.\n\nThe binding energy (blue solid line) is also close to the thin disk\ncounterpart (blue dashed line) outside the innermost stable orbit\n($r_{\\rm ISCO}=6{r_{\\rm g}}$). This fact reflects almost Keplerian angular\nmomentum of the gas in the discussed simulation and relatively\ninsignificant radial velocity contribution. The behavior is, however,\nqualitatively different inside the ISCO. While in the standard thin disk model\nthere is no torque acting on the gas inside that\nradius \\citep{paczynski-00}\\footnote{\\cite{paczynski-00} has shown that\n  the torque at the inner edge dissapears if only angular momentum is\n  conserved, disk is thin ($h/r\\ll 1$), and the viscosity parameter is\n  small ($\\alpha\\ll 1$). In our solution the last condition is not\n  satisfied, with $\\alpha \\approx 0.3$ at ISCO and reaching $0.9$ near\n  $r=3{r_{\\rm g}}$.} and binding\nenergy is constant in the plunging region, the numerical solution\nshows that gas becomes more and more bound after crossing ISCO and,\nas a result, more and more energy is transported as binding energy. This means\nthat significant stresses act inside ISCO, what should not be surprising having\nin mind how strongly magnetized the gas is (see \\cite{noble+10}, but\nalso \\cite{shafee+08,penna+10,kulkarni+11}).\n\nThe profile of radiative luminosity is also very close to the thin\ndisk profile (compare solid and dashed orange lines). At radius\n$r=15{r_{\\rm g}}$ radiative flux carries out $\\sim 1\\%\\,\\dot Mc^2$, only\nca. $10\\%$ less than the standard model predicts. The behavior in the\ninnermost region is, however, again very different. According to the standard thin\ndisk model, no radiation crosses the ISCO or is generated inside that\nradius. In this numerical simulation, on the contrary, significant\ndissipation takes place in the innermost region. Nevertheless, most of the\nradiation emitted there ends up inside\nthe BH because it is either trapped in the flow or is strongly\ncollimated towards the BH (compare the bottommost panel of Fig.~\\ref{f.phisli}). Photons\ncrossing the horizon carry roughly $2\\%\\,\\dot M c^2$.\n\nFinally, the viscous flux of energy once again agrees well in the outer region with the\npredictions of the analytical thin disk modeling\nbut disagrees in the innermost\n($r\\lesssim 10{r_{\\rm g}}$) region where noticeable viscous energy transport\ntakes place, in disagreement with the standard modeling.\n\nTo sum up, the simulated magnetically supported thin disk shows\nsignificant dissipation and stress inside the ISCO, in the\nso-called plunging region, inconsistent with the\nstandard model. However, somewhat surprisingly, the energetics of the\ndisk far from the BH agrees very well with the standard modeling. The\nextra energy extracted in the innermost region does not have a chance\nof being observed from infinity\\footnote{Similar conclusion was\n  reached by \\cite{zhu+eye} who studied radiation from artificially\n  cooled thin MHD disks.}. Whether this is true also for thinner, less\noptically thick disks, corresponding to lower accretion rates, has to\nbe verified numerically in the future.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\includegraphics[width=1.\\columnwidth]{enfluxes_plusthin_r217b_3d.png}\n \\caption{\nEnergy flow through the stable simulation \\texttt{Q} (solid lines) compared to\nthe thin-disk solution (dashed lines). \n  }\n \\label{f.enfluxes}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{s.discussion}\n\n\\subsection{Net flux of magnetic field}\n\nWe have shown that thin and radiatively efficient accretion disks \nare thermally stable when dominated by magnetic pressure. The necessary condition for the stability is\nstrong magnetic support which is provided mainly by the azimuthal\ncomponent of the field. In the case of our stable simulation (model\n\\texttt{Q}) such strong azimuthal field developed as a result of\nnon-zero radial flux of magnetic field inside the disk \nAre astrophysical accretion disks likely to have significant net\nradial flux? \n\nIt is tempting to expect that the origin of such a large-scale field\nis the advection of the field by the gas in the accretion disk from\nthe interstellar medium or a companion star. If only such a field is\nnot perfectly dipolar (or uneven-polar) one may expect that the\nasymmetry leads to effectively a non-zero radial flux in the\nbulk of the disk. However, whether or not the large-scale field can be\nadvected into the innermost region depends on the balance between the\nadvection and diffusion of the field. Standard geometrically thin\ndisks are unlikely to drag significant amount of magnetic field on to\nthe BH \\citep{lubow+94,ghosh+97}. However, as\n\\cite{guletogilvie-12,guletogilvie-13} found, if one takes into\naccount the vertical structure of the disk, the advection of magnetic\nflux can be much faster than found originally. Indeed, it may be the case for\nthe strongly magnetized solutions discussed here which not only show much larger\nradial velocities than the standard model predicts, but also the\nvelocities increase significantly towards the surface of the disk.\n\nThere is also another way of obtaining an accretion disk\ndominated by magnetic pressure which, on the contrary, does not\nrequire (at least initially)\nefficient advection of magnetic field. As \\cite{machida+06} pointed out, when an\nX-ray binary undergoes the transition from the low/hard state\n(corresponding to low accretion rates and low optical depths) to\nthe high/soft state (at larger accretion rates), the disk starts to\ncool and shrinks in the vertical direction while almost conserving the\ntoroidal magnetic flux (we see such behavior in the collapse of model \\texttt{D}). Such a process leads to a cooler, magnetically\nsupported, quasi-steady state. \\cite{machida+06} have shown that such\na configuration can exist for at least the thermal time. Whether it can\nsurvive for much longer times, without relaxing to the lower\nmagnetization state implied by local, zero-flux numerical studies, has\nstill to be verified \\citep[note recent work by][]{wielgus+15}.\n\n\\subsection{Observables}\n\nThe magnetically supported thin disks, an example of which has been\npresented in this work, differ from the standard model of thin disks\n\\citep{ss73} in two aspects. Firstly, they are supported by\nmagnetic pressure, not the radiation pressure, although the two have\nsimilar magnitudes. This fact results in a disk thicker than standard\none at the same radius and accretion rate. The effective color\ntemperature is also higher because the photosphere is now located in\nthe strongly magnetized, hot region where photons are  efficiently\nup-scattered by hot electrons. Secondly, the high magnetization\nimplies significant stresses taking place at and inside ISCO. As a\nresult, radiation is efficiently generated in the plunging region,\nin contrary to the assumptions of the standard model. However,\nfor the slightly sub-Eddington disk presented in this work, all this\nexcess of generated radiation is advected on the BH, and the\nluminosity of the system, as seen from the distance, very well agrees\nwith the efficiency of the standard disks. \n\nWhat would such a magnetized thin disk system look like? Because the\nextra radiation generated by dissipation in the plunging region does\nnot escape, one may expect similar luminosities to the predicted by\nthe standard model. However, the spectrum may look different. Thicker\ndisk would imply larger color temperature and harder spectrum (what\nwould bring continuum-based BH spin estimates down). Also a\nstronger inclination dependence may be expected. Better answers will\nbe provided once detailed frequency- and angle-resolved calculations\nof the radiation transfer based on numerical simulations like ours\nare performed.\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\\label{s.summary}\n\nWe have performed two three-dimensional, global, general relativistic,\nradiative simulations of sub-Eddington accretion disks. The\nsimulations were initialized with different configurations of the\nmagnetic field. One of them evolved into a magnetically supported\nstate in thermal equilibrium with strong magnetic field maintained by a non-zero radial\nmagnetic flux in the bulk of the disk. The other did not develop\nstrong magnetic field, showed consisted excess of cooling over heating\nand continued collapsing towards the equatorial plane. We summarize\nour conclusions as following:\n\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textit{Thermal stability:} -- We have shown that magnetic\n  pressure dominated thin, sub-Eddington accretion disks can maintain\n  thermal equilibrium, in contrast to thermally unstable disks\n  dominated by radiation pressure.\n\n\\item \\textit{Magnetization:} -- The strong magnetization required for\n  stabilization of thin disks results either from the presence of\n  a non-zero radial magnetic flux (what requires efficient advection\n  of large-scale magnetic field by the disk), or from the collapse of\n  previously thick disk during the hard to soft transition.\n\n\\item \\textit{Standard model:} -- The magnetically supported thin\n  disks are thicker than standard ones at the same radius and\n  accretion rate. They also show significant dissipation inside\n  ISCO. Radiation released in this region, however, does not escape\n  but is advected on the BH. Whether this statement is true for lower\n  accretion rates than simulated here ($0.8{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}$) has still to be\n  verified.\n\n\\item \\textit{Luminosity:} -- Despite strong dissipation and torque\n  inside ISCO, the efficiency of the simulated disk ($5.5\\pm0.5\\%$) turns\n  out to be very close to the prediction of the standard model\n  ($5.7\\%$). The spectrum of the observed radiation, however, is\n  likely to be harder due to the photosphere extending further away\n  from the equatorial plane. Detailed spectral calculations of this\n  mode of accretion will follow.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\n\nThe author thanks David Abarca for his contribution and Ramesh\nNarayan, Jean-Pierre Lasota and Marek Abramowicz for helpful comments.\nThe author acknowledges support\nfor this work \nby NASA through Einstein Postdoctotral Fellowship number PF4-150126\nawarded by the Chandra X-ray Center, which is operated by the\nSmithsonian\nAstrophysical Observatory for NASA under contract NAS8-0306These authors 0. \nThe author acknowledges computational support from NSF via XSEDE resources\n(grants TG-AST080026N and TG-AST150019), and\nfrom NASA via the High-End Computing (HEC) Program\nthrough the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at Ames\nResearch Center.
