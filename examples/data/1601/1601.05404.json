of individual system components are found throughout nature and society,  and much of science is dedicated to identifying and understanding the origin of such patterns.\nReaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) were used by Alan Turing to explain chemical  pattern formation on a spatial domain \\cite{turing1990chemical} and there has been recent interest in understanding the interactions in social systems from a physics perspective \\cite{castellano2009statistical}.\n\nInteractions between individual system components can be represented as networks \\cite{strogatz2001exploring}, with network structure revealing much about the underlying systems and their dynamics \\cite{palla2005uncovering}.\nThere is now growing interest in reaction-diffusion systems organised on complex network topologies, where the interactions are transmitted between nodes via the network links (or {\\em edges}), particularly in systems with activator-inhibitor dynamics on the nodes.\nPotential applications include pattern development from networks of activating and suppressing genes involved in embryonic development \\cite{nakao2010turing}, as well as the evolution of complex structures ({\\em autocatalytic sets}) in systems of competing proteins, such as could lead to the origin of life from a random starting condition \\cite{jain1998autocatalytic}.\nThe networks connecting individuals in a social system also often have non-local connections \\cite{watts1998collective} and non-trivial geometries \\cite{erdos1960evolution, barabasi1999emergence}, making the concept of a {\\em pattern} less obvious in such non-spatial domains.\n\nRecent numerical results have revealed a multiplicity of bulk activation states ({\\em Turing modes}) in a predator-prey type reaction-diffusion model on a scale-free ({\\em Barab\\'asi--Albert}) type network \\cite{nakao2010turing}.\nIn addition, regular networks (lattices) -- as used to numerically investigate spatially extended systems of PDEs -- can exhibit localised patterns, which are connected via ``snaking bifurcations'' in the parameter space of the system.\n\nThis work demonstrates how solutions with a single activated node are connected to increasingly larger patterns of activity and bulk-modes via a similar  {\\em snaking bifurcations} structure.\nThe importance of network structure (i.e.~the {\\em node degree}) in the dynamics is also demonstrated.\nThese bifurcations lead to a highly complex {\\em ``turmoil''} of coexisting states, necessitating a statistical approach to understanding the behaviour of the system.\n\n\\subsection{Pattern Formation and Reaction-Diffusion Systems}\n\nAlan Turing laid down the basis for pattern formation  on a spatial domain, based the loss of stability of an unpatterned equilibrium to another non-trivial (patterned) state \\cite{turing1990chemical}, in an attempt to explain morphogenesis in embryonic development.\nSuch situations can be set up as a system of competing chemical species in a reaction-diffusion system:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align} \n\\begin{split}\n\\dot{u} & =  f(u,v) + {\\varepsilon} \\nabla^2 u

mean-field approach used elsewhere \\cite{pastor2001epidemic}, was used in order to explain the bifurcations of the most basic single differentiated node (SDN) states from the undifferentiated equilibrium-state.\nA further consequence of this analysis is that the stability of \\eqref{e:wolfrum} depends on the interaction between the reaction terms (contained in the functions $f$ and $g$) and the node degree.\nThis leads to the prediction that a certain {\\em preferential degree} can exist, for which activated solutions appear at some minimum value of the control parameter $\\sigma$.\nThis result reveals an important connection between network structure and the dynamics of the system.\n\n\\subsection{Localised Patterns and Snaking Bifurcations}\n\nAs well as Turing patterns covering the whole spatial domain, spatially localised patterns have also been observed in a variety of experimental and numerical systems.\nIn particular, localised buckling was observed in experiments on cylindrical shells by Hunt et al. \\cite{hunt1999buckling}, and explained using numerical continuation using discretisation schemes. \nNumerical continuation (as well as certain well-controlled experiments) have shown that localised patterns of increasing spatial extent are connected by folds and cusps in the one-parameter bifurcation diagram, in what are called {\\em ``snaking bifurcations''}.\nSnaking bifurcations originate in a subcritical bifurcation from the equilibrium state and are so-called due to their structure then winding upwards back-and forth in the one-dimensional parameter space.\nAs the bifurcation curve snakes upwards in amplitude, the spatial pattern grows incrementally by one wavelength for each bifurcation curve, as summarised in \\cite{hunt2006buckling}.\nThe origin and development of these localised solutions via snaking has now been extensively investigated in numerical and analytical studies of reaction--diffusion systems on regular lattices. \nThe connection between localised patterns via snaking bifurcation has been shown to occur via a sequence of homoclinic folds in the codimension-2 bifurcation diagram \\cite{champneys2012homoclinic}.\n\nOther bifurcation structures can develop in these systems, due to symmetry-breaking perturbations to the system \\cite{knobloch2011nonreversible, knobloch2012non}.\nExamples of such structures include the splitting up of snakes into a rung-like structure (so called {\\em ``snakes and ladders''}) \\cite{knobloch2011isolas}, as well as self-connected solutions that are not linked to the ground-state ({\\em``isolas''}) \\cite{sandstede2012snakes}.\nThe mechanism for the transition between localised patterns via snaking bifurcations is therefore theoretically well established for such regular systems.\n\n\nAside from reaction-diffusion systems, similar localised patterns have also been observed in physical experiments and bifurcation studies on other systems. \nExamples include experimental observations in optical systems \\cite{Barbay2008}, numerical results for plain Couette flow \\cite{schneider2010snakes}, as well as experimentally and analytically for hexagonal localised patterns in magnetic fluids \\cite{lloyd2015homoclinic}. \nBifurcation analysis has shown that it is also a snaking bifurcation structure that connects the different localised patterns in these systems, indicating that this is a robust and universal mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{The Mimura-Murray Model}\n\n\nThe current investigation focusses on the Mimura-Murray model of prey-predator populations \\cite{mimura1978diffusive},  following on from the work of Nakao and Mikhailov \\cite{nakao2010turing}.\nThe kinetics of the reaction-diffusion system (eqn.~\\eqref{e:rdco}) are described by the following equations:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 7128, "prevtext":

The number of nodes is $N=50$ and degree of attachment for each newly added node is $M=5$. \n(b) This scheme gives a scale-free distribution in the limit of $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, but here, where $N$ is finite, the degree distribution only approximates scale-free.}\\label{fig:network}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA network with 50 nodes was used for these investigations, where new nodes added at each generation step have five edges assigned preferentially to higher degree existing nodes. \nThe routines in the {\\em NetworkX} module for Python were used to generate and visualise the networks.\nDifferent topologies with the same characteristics were investigated to ensure consistent qualitative behaviour, but only one representative realisation is shown here.\nFor the majority of results in this work the {\\em degree of attachment} $M=5$ was used in the network generation scheme (Fig.~\\ref{fig:network}).\nIn these cases it can be seen that numerous nodes of the optimal $d_k^*=9$ lie towards the middle of the degree distribution.\nFor the later (comparison) cases $M=10$ was used to generate the network, in which the optimal degree nodes instead have amongst the lowest degree in the network (being close to the {\\em periphery}), resulting in important differences in the system behaviour.\n\n\n\\subsection{Numerical Techniques}\n\nComputations were started from the single-node (SDN) solutions, studied in previous work \\cite{wolfrum2012turing}, which bifurcate from the undifferentiated state at the point $\\sigma_T$. \nAll possible singly differentiates node (SDN) solutions were found by numerically integrating the equations of the system from some random initial condition then refining using numerical root finding (using the widely available \\texttt{fsolve} routine).\nThe solutions were then followed back and forth in their meander through the parameter space of the system using numerical {\\em continuation} techniques provided by the AUTO bifurcation software \\cite{doedel1981auto}. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\n\n\\subsection{From Localised Patterns to Large-Scale Activation}\n\n\n\nStarting from single node (SDN) solutions and following the solutions in the bifurcation space  the transition between the SDN solutions and multiply differentiated node (MDN) states was investigated.\nThe connection between different states in the system was uncovered, as well as their coexistence with the fully developed (so called {\\em ``Turing''}) patterns reported in \\cite{nakao2010turing}.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The growth of activation patterns.}\n\nAs can be seen in Figure \\ref{fig:snake}, for certain cases the bifurcation curve exhibits a clear {\\em snaking} behaviour, with SDN solutions winding backwards and forwards in the space of the parameter $\\sigma$.\nEach of the bifurcation curves  fold back to the left at some point, with the associated solutions becoming unstable as another node on the network becomes differentiated from the ground-state.\nThis is directly analogous to the snaking bifurcations seen in regular topologies as larger patterns develop from more localised ones.  \nIn Figure \\ref{fig:snake} each stable branch of the bifurcation curve corresponds to a different solution with different numbers of differentiated nodes, corresponding to larger values of the magnitude (L-2 Norm) of the vector displacements $||\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}||$, plotted on the $y$-axis.\nIn the example shown, with a clear snaking structure, the branches connect solutions with increasing numbers of differentiated nodes, the rest of the network remaining largely the same \\footnote{This can be more clearly seen in the supplementary video \\url{snaking.mov}}.\nThis provides further evidence that snaking is a universal phenomenon in localised pattern formation.\n\nThe snaking bifurcations can be continued further, with the bifurcation structure becoming highly complicated. \nHowever, for this network realisation, where the optimal degree (shown in green) is somewhere part-way between the core and periphery of the network, the bifurcations do not directly connect the patterns of ``localised'' activity to the bulk ``Turing-type'' modes.\nThese modes are abundant, but exist in a disconnected subset of the bifurcation turmoil.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.47\\textwidth]{snaking.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{newsolutionB.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{newsolutionC.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{newsolutionD.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:snake} A snaking bifurcation (a) connecting solutions with patterns of increasing numbers of differentiated nodes.

The first three solutions are shown in  (b)--(d), with nodes ordered left--right by decreasing node degree ($d_k$ network neighbours -- also shown in colour) and the lines show the links between adjacent nodes.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Development of large scale activation.}\n\nDifferent network structures can effect different system behaviour, whereby the localised states do indeed connect to the Turing modes of full-blown system-scale activation.\nFor this alternative network realisation a degree of attachment of $M=10$ was used to generate the network. \nIn this case the optimal degree $d_k^*=9$ nodes were instead found towards the periphery of the network, being amongst the lowest degree.\n\nThe connection between the two regimes is via a complicated series of snaking bifurcations, as shown in the example in Figure \\ref{fig:toturing}, where the ``snakes'' are found to coil up and down in a cobra-like manner  as different nodes become differentiated and undifferentiated. \nThis provides a clear connection between small-scale patterns and the larger bulk patterns of activity seen in the work of Nakao and Mikhailov \\cite{nakao2010turing}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!!]\n\\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{snakingTuring.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{sol68.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:toturing} Growth from localised activity to system scale {\\em Turing-type} patterns in a network with {\\em attachment degree} $M=10$.

The optimal degree $d_k^*=9$ nodes (shown in green) are towards the periphery of the network.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe difference between this and the previous case reveals the importance of the network structure, its interaction with the reaction dynamics and the resulting behaviour of the system.\nThe position of the optimal degree nodes within the network strongly affects the connectedness of solutions as these are preferentially the first nodes to be activated.\n\n\\subsubsection{Disconnected Solutions}\n\nAs well as states connected to the undifferentiated {\\em ground-state}, a large number of disconnected  branches were also found, similar to those seen in studies on lattice systems.\nAll cases where bifurcation curves included single-node differentiation of nodes with the lowest degree ($d_k=5$) were found to be of the simple {\\em figure-8} isola-loop kind in this case, \nbut in other cases the bifurcations wind around in a very complicated way (see supplementary material for example plots).\nMany of these complicated bifurcation curves coexist multistably, inhabiting a complicated {\\em ``zoo''} of\nbehaviour.\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear that at there exist an enormous number of coexisting combinations of differentiated nodes, connected by a vast number of complicated bifurcation structures, covering a range of parameter values.\nUnderstanding the statistical distribution of states over these values will be valuable in understanding the variety of patterns and possible configurations that can be exhibited by such systems.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Multiplicity of solutions}\n\n\nAs before, the initial SDN solutions were isolated before being continued in the parameter space, as can be seen in the lower branches of Figure \\ref{fig:mdn}.\n\nThe region that these solutions occupy closely agrees with the predictions of the reduced-system approach of Wolfrum \\cite{wolfrum2012turing}. \nIn addition, the stable branches that appear for for the lowest value of $\\sigma$ are those  with the optimum degree, as predicted from Wolfrum's work.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of these SDN states were then used as initial conditions for the continuation further up the snaking bifurcations into MDN solutions. \nThe snaking bifurcations for all accessible states with up to 9DN are shown together in Figure \\ref{fig:mdn}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{allstab_5.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.49\\textwidth]{allstab_2.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:mdn} Full set of solution branches at lower $\\sigma$ values, showing both stable and unstable branches together.

(a) The $M=5$ networks with $d_k^*$ intermediate in position, and (b) the $M=10$ network with $d_k^*$ near the periphery.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n \nThese different solutions coexist multistably at the same parameter values. \nThe clear bunching seen for SDN solutions becomes more diffuse as more nodes become differentiated and the nodes interact more strongly.\nSolutions are tightly bounded in the bifurcation space and contained in a region which continues to high values of $\\sigma$ and bulk modes of activity. \nA notable feature of the results is that the initial ``snaking'' column, for small numbers of differentiated nodes, curves markedly to the right, in contrast to studies on regular geometries and spatial systems.\nThis can be explained heuristically by considering that, for each number of differentiated nodes there exists some stable branch that appears for minimal $\\sigma$, which consists of solutions with differentiated nodes of optimal degree, as predicted by Wolfrum \\cite{wolfrum2012turing}.\nHowever, at some point he MDNs run out of nodes with optimal degree to be differentiated and instead another node activates, which necessarily has a higher activation $\\sigma$.\n\n\n\nAnalytically determining these {\\em regions of existence} for networks should be an important area for future analytical study in such complex systems. \nThis should be amenable to rigorous analysis, such as extensions of the theory of {\\em N-pulse solutions}  found in snaking on regular systems \\cite{knobloch2008snaking, knobloch2011isolas}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Statistical density of states}\n\nTwo clear peaks can be seen in the histograms of (a) and (c), with the broader of the two  peaks appearing at higher $\\sigma$ associated with bulk modes of the system.\nThe narrow peak at low $\\sigma$ is associated with the cluster of localised solutions and the growth to extended patterns, connected via the snaking bifurcations. \nClear differences can be seen for the two different network topologies, again highlighting the important role of network structure in organising the dynamics.\nIn the more highly connected $M=10$ network the bulk solutions are most abundant at lower values of the control parameter $\\sigma$ and are more smoothly connected than in the case where the optimal degree is buried deep in the network.\n\nThe region of existence described in the previous section can be most clearly seen in the two dimensional density plot shown in Figures \\ref{fig:hist} (b) and (d), showing the density of bifurcation curves over a wide range of the parameter $\\sigma$. \nThe projection onto a one-dimensional histogram in $\\sigma$ shown in (b) clearly shows the number of available system configurations at each of the parameter values.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{allstab-a70-histo3D.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{allstab-b70-histo3D.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:hist} Statistical distributions of solutions, shown as the both histogram and 2D density plot over the bifurcation space for a range of values of the control parameter $\\sigma$.

similar treatment could shed light on the potential configurations possible in a vast number of systems of this type arising in nature.\nExamples of such systems with both activator-inhibitor kinetics as well as complex interaction topologies include: gene networks; protein species interaction networks, such as those seen in early evolution; and competition networks in other complex natural and human systems, such as social and economic systems.\n \n\\section{Summary and Conclusions}\n\nIn this research a reaction diffusion system on a complex network topology has been numerically investigated in detail. \nThe results have revealed the transition  between the single-node solutions, studied in \\cite{wolfrum2012turing}, which bifurcate from the undifferentiated state, and the fully developed patterns reported in  \\cite{nakao2010turing}.\nThis was carried out by numerical continuation of the solutions in the parameter-space of the system and study of the solutions found along the various multistable branches found at each set of values.\nThe results show that snaking bifurcation, like those found in reaction--diffusion systems on regular lattice network topologies, explain the origin of and connection between the multistability of states found in previous work \\cite{nakao2010turing}.\n\nThe important connection between network structure, reaction kinetics and resulting system behaviour has also been revealed, including the importance of the optimal degree nodes.\n\n\n\n\nA statistical analysis of the bifurcation-structure has been used to present the multiplicity of configurations available to systems on networks. \nUnderstanding the density of solutions and bifurcation curves that exist within certain regions of the control parameter space is expected to reveal much about the underlying systems being modelled. \nIn systems of competing chemical or biological agents the density of states could indicate the diversity of species that can exist at different values of some external environmental parameter.\nSimilar analogies could be made when modelling social systems, as well as many other complex systems, as competing interactions via networks.\n \n \n \n \n \n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nThis work was started by, and completed in memory of, Thomas Wagenknecht.\nNJM would like to thank Matthias Wolfrum and the Weierstrass

the equilibrium $(\\bar u, \\bar v)$ \\cite{wolfrum2012turing}.\nThis analysis, similar to the mean-field approach used elsewhere \\cite{pastor2001epidemic}, was used in order to explain the bifurcations of the most basic single differentiated node (SDN) states from the undifferentiated equilibrium-state.\nA further consequence of this analysis is that the stability of \\eqref{e:wolfrum} depends on the interaction between the reaction terms (contained in the functions $f$ and $g$) and the node degree.\nThis leads to the prediction that a certain {\\em preferential degree} can exist, for which activated solutions appear at some minimum value of the control parameter $\\sigma$.\nThis result reveals an important connection between network structure and the dynamics of the system.\n\n\\subsection{Localised Patterns and Snaking Bifurcations}\n\nAs well as Turing patterns covering the whole spatial domain, spatially localised patterns have also been observed in a variety of experimental and numerical systems.\nIn particular, localised buckling was observed in experiments on cylindrical shells by Hunt et al. \\cite{hunt1999buckling}, and explained using numerical continuation using discretisation schemes. \nNumerical continuation (as well as certain well-controlled experiments) have shown that localised patterns of increasing spatial extent are connected by folds and cusps in the one-parameter bifurcation diagram, in what are called {\\em ``snaking bifurcations''}.\nSnaking bifurcations originate in a subcritical bifurcation from the equilibrium state and are so-called due to their structure then winding upwards back-and forth in the one-dimensional parameter space.\nAs the bifurcation curve snakes upwards in amplitude, the spatial pattern grows incrementally by one wavelength for each bifurcation curve, as summarised in \\cite{hunt2006buckling}.\nThe origin and development of these localised solutions via snaking has now been extensively investigated in numerical and analytical studies of reaction--diffusion systems on regular lattices. \nThe connection between localised patterns via snaking bifurcation has been shown to occur via a sequence of homoclinic folds in the codimension-2 bifurcation diagram \\cite{champneys2012homoclinic}.\n\nOther bifurcation structures can develop in these systems, due to symmetry-breaking perturbations to the system \\cite{knobloch2011nonreversible, knobloch2012non}.\nExamples of such structures include the splitting up of snakes into a rung-like structure (so called {\\em ``snakes and ladders''}) \\cite{knobloch2011isolas}, as well as self-connected solutions that are not linked to the ground-state ({\\em``isolas''}) \\cite{sandstede2012snakes}.\nThe mechanism for the transition between localised patterns via snaking bifurcations is therefore theoretically well established for such regular systems.\n\n\nAside from reaction-diffusion systems, similar localised patterns have also been observed in physical experiments and bifurcation studies on other systems. \nExamples include experimental observations in optical systems \\cite{Barbay2008}, numerical results for plain Couette flow \\cite{schneider2010snakes}, as well as experimentally and analytically for hexagonal localised patterns in magnetic fluids \\cite{lloyd2015homoclinic}. \nBifurcation analysis has shown that it is also a snaking bifurcation structure that connects the different localised patterns in these systems, indicating that this is a robust and universal mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n
