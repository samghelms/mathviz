Consider the voltage\ndistribution induced by structural disorder.  If we could randomly assign\nvoltages directly\nfrom this distribution, the element with the largest voltage drop in the\nnetwork would cross its threshold first as the voltage at the boundaries was\nincreased.  At a mean-field level, this is equivalent to\nassigning a threshold randomly to elements all held at the same voltage and\nallowing the element with the lowest threshold to switch as the voltage is adiabatically \nincreased.  Since we can regard these two types of disorder as equivalent, and\nnetworks may display disorder in the threshold distribution as well, we absorb\nthe structural disorder into the threshold distribution and regard the\nrandomly assigned threshold as representing the combination of many possible\ntypes of disorder in the network.  \n\n\n\n\n\nElements in the lattice start in the thermodynamically favored OFF state with conductance\n$G_{off}$ and each is assigned a current threshold $I_{t,i}$ from a distribution\n$p(t)$.  When an element's threshold is crossed, it switches immediately to\nits conducting ON state with conductance $G_{on}$. When no elements are\nswitching, the voltage is raised until the next threshold is crossed and\nsubsequent switchings are allowed to occur with the\nboundary voltage held fixed.  Memristive elements are also generally polar \\cite{Hasegawa2012}. Here, \nwe have chosen the polarity to coincide with the direction selected by\ncurrents from the boundaries (see the Supplemental Material for a discussion of this effect).\n\n{\\it Simulations - } Simulations were carried out for a square lattice at a\nvariety of sizes,\nON/OFF ratios, and threshold distributions $p(t)$.  The network dimensions\nwere chosen such that the conductivity of the network proceeded from $G_{off}$\nto $G_{on}$.  To reduce finite size effects, networks were periodic in the \ndirection, $\\hat{x}$, transverse to the direction along the applied voltage, $\\hat{y}$. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{Cond_fig} we show the network conductances as a function of\napplied voltage for various values of $G_{on}$ (setting $G_{off} = 1$), and for\nthreshold distribution $p(t) = \\textrm{Uniform}(0,1)$.  The displayed networks have\na linear size of $L_x=64$ lattice sites which we found large enough to achieve\nregular results over multiple realizations of the disorder. Conductances\nhave been scaled to lie on the interval $[0,1]$. We note that for small values\nof $G_{on}$ the conductance is a smooth function of the voltage.  As $G_{on}$\nis increased, a discontinuity forms in the slope which sharpens, appearing\nalmost continuous until a discontinuous jump appears for large $G_{on}$\nindicating a {\\it first-order phase transition}.

The resulting dynamics\nbear a close resemblance to the short-term and long-term potentiation observed in\nbiological synapses which are thought to be of central importance to learning and\nplasticity in the brain~\\cite{Chialvo2010}.  This resemblance has inspired the realization of experimental\nsystems that seek to combine the memory features of biological synapses with\nthe structural complexity of neural tissue \\cite{Avizienis2012, Stieg2014}. In fact, research is being\nperformed to assess the advantage of using memristive elements in non-von\nNeumann architectures and is already showing that their networks \ndynamically organize into the solutions of complex computational problems, thereby\nperforming the computation directly in the memory and avoiding the separation\nbetween logic and memory units \\cite{Ventra2013, Pershin2013, Traversa2015, Traversa15}.  \n\nAll of these studies however, still lack a fundamental understanding of the role of time non-locality in the dynamics of memristive networks and their statistical properties. For instance, high density \n($\\sim 10^9$ elements/cm$^2$) disordered networks of memristive Ag/Ag$_2$S/Ag atomic\n switches have been fabricated showing collective switching behavior between a low-resistance (ON) and high-resistance (OFF) state, and possible critical states potentially useful in neuromorphic computation \\cite{Langton1990,Chialvo2010, Stieg2012}. Some theoretical work \n has attempted to reproduce several features observed in the experiments by performing simulations in relatively small networks but an understanding of the dynamics of such systems is far from clear \\cite{NedaaeeOskoee2011, Sillin2013}. \nTheoretical investigations of one-dimensional memristive networks have shown\ncomplex temporal dynamics and scale-invariant properties, but\nhave not clarified whether further collective behavior might arise in\nhigher dimensions \\cite{diVentra2013}. \n\nInspired by these experiments, in this paper we study the statistical properties of two-dimensional disordered memristive networks subject to an external bias. We show that these networks experience a {\\it first-order phase transition} in the conductivity in the limit of a slowly ramped voltage and for\nsufficiently large values of the memory, as quantified by the memristive ON/OFF ratio.  We find that this behavior is well described by a mean-field theory\nsimilar to that of the zero-temperature random-field Ising model \\cite{Sethna1993} with the memristive state playing the role of the spins and the disorder entering through the device thresholds as has been done in\nthe analysis of fuse networks \\cite{Zapperi1999}.\nThe mean-field theory corroborates several regimes of behavior observed in the simulations and is\ncapable of showing a collective bipolar switching (a phase transition from the OFF to ON state and\nvice versa).  In addition, the dynamics implied by the mean-field theory demonstrate\navalanches similar to those observed in neuronal cultures \\cite{Beggs2003}, leading \nto a distribution of conductance jumps which is accessible experimentally. These results shed considerable light on the statistical and collective properties of networks with memristive elements that are being currently explored for neuromorphic applications. \n\n\n{\\it Model -} As inspiration and as a test bed for disordered memristive networks we consider\nthe Ag/Ag$_2$S/Ag gapless atomic switches experimentally fabricated in\n\\cite{Avizienis2012, Stieg2014, Sillin2014}. The model we consider though, is quite general and can be applied\nto a variety of other materials and systems \\cite{Pershin2011}. Indeed, as in the case of\nsilver sulfide between two silver\nelectrodes, many resistive switching systems - when subject to an applied\nvoltage - form filament structures that eventually\nbridge the insulator \\cite{Xu2010}. As the filament grows, the\ntunneling gap shrinks and there is an eventual transition from tunneling\nto ballistic conductance with the filament's completion\n\\cite{Hasegawa2010, Sun2014}. The conductance of the junction is thus not\nnecessarily a linear function of the filament length, and may increase sharply\nover some short domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thermodynamically favored OFF state gives\nrise to a current (or voltage) threshold in the devices, below which thermal\nfluctuations dominate and filament growth will not occur, but above which the\ndevices proceed quickly to a conducting state. This implies that the conductance change of an individual switch occurs faster than the change in the external voltage. Therefore, we can\neffectively model the elements as switching discretely from a conductance $G_{off}$ to a conductance \n$G_{on}$, when a threshold current, $I_t>0$, is crossed\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nG(I) = G_{off} + (G_{on} - G_{off})\\theta (I - I_t)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"G(I)=G_{off}+(G_{on}-G_{off})\\theta(I-I_{t})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>I</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>G</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>G</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>t</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05772.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the equivalence defines the network conductance $G(\\{\\sigma_i\\})$.\nUsing the effective medium approximation and inserting factors of $\\phi(f)$,\nwe find,\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 12905, "prevtext": "\nwhere $I$ is the current through the device, and $\\theta(\\cdot)$ is the Heaviside function of the argument. \n\n\n\nThe reverse branch can be obtained by exchanging $G_{on}$ and $G_{off}$ and\n$I$ and $I_t$ for a different threshold $I_t<0$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{PT_Networks_Conductances-2.png}\n\\caption{The network conductance for several values of $G_{on}$ are plotted\nagainst the applied voltage.

We can understand the non-monotonic\nform of $h(f)$ as arising from competition between switching elements\nconcentrating current away from other elements, and the increasing conductance\nof the network pulling more current in at the boundaries.  For small $f$, the\naverage conductance of an element is increasing faster than the network\nconductivity, indicating that current is concentrated away from other elements\nmore quickly than it increases at the boundaries, and the mean-field voltage\ndecreases.  For larger $f$, the network conductance begins to increase more\nquickly than the average conductance, pulling in current faster than switching\nelements can concentrate it, and the mean-field voltage increases.  The\nincreasing regime at large $f$ allows for a phase transition to occur from\nOFF to ON state and the decreasing portion at low $f$ allows for the possibility\nof the reverse transition when the voltage is reversed.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{MF_voltage.png}\n\\caption{ $h(f) = \\sqrt{\\frac{G(f)}{\\phi(f)}}$ is plotted for several values of\n$G_{on}$.

We observe a first-order phase transition similar to that observed in the\nOFF-to-ON branch. However, this transition occurs for much lower values of $G_{on}$ and near the limiting\nvalue of the conductance.  This can be attributed to the form of $h(f_R)$ (see Fig. 2 in the main text).  As we proceed from $f=1$ to $0$, in the vicinity of $f=0$ the average conductance $\\phi(f)$ is decreasing more rapidly than the network conductance $G_{eff}(f)$.  This leads the internal switches to redistribute current to their neighbors faster than the decrease of the total current at the boundary.  This increases the mean-field voltage overall, and hence promotes a transition.  We reiterate that, as\nwith the forward transition, in the mean-field picture, transitions occur due to competition between a changing current at the boundaries and the internal sharing of currents within the network, as summarized by the function $h(f)= \\sqrt{\\frac{G(f)}{\\phi(f)}}$.

We observe a first-order phase transition similar to that observed in the\nOFF-to-ON branch. However, this transition occurs for much lower values of $G_{on}$ and near the limiting\nvalue of the conductance.  This can be attributed to the form of $h(f_R)$ (see Fig. 2 in the main text).  As we proceed from $f=1$ to $0$, in the vicinity of $f=0$ the average conductance $\\phi(f)$ is decreasing more rapidly than the network conductance $G_{eff}(f)$.  This leads the internal switches to redistribute current to their neighbors faster than the decrease of the total current at the boundary.  This increases the mean-field voltage overall, and hence promotes a transition.  We reiterate that, as\nwith the forward transition, in the mean-field picture, transitions occur due to competition between a changing current at the boundaries and the internal sharing of currents within the network, as summarized by the function $h(f)= \\sqrt{\\frac{G(f)}{\\phi(f)}}$.  Due to the narrow range in which the reverse transition occurs, it may be more difficult to observe experimentally.\n\nCombining this with our analysis of the OFF-to-ON transition, we may integrate the self-consistency equations\nto find the function $f(v)$ and thus the conductance and current as a function of the voltage.  In Fig. \\ref{IV_curves} we have plotted the I-V curves for several values of $G_{on}$ and\n$p(t) = p_R(t) = \\text{Uniform}(0,1)$.  For $G_{on}=10$, the forward transition is smooth while \na barely discernible jump appears for the reverse.  At $G_{on}=30$ a transition in the forward branch begins\nto appear, and for large values of the $G_{on}$ this evolves to a discontinuous jump in the current.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{MF_self_consist_r.png}\n\t\\caption{The lhs (blue) and rhs (red) of Eq.~(\\ref{selfconsist_R}) are plotted\n\t\tfor several values of the applied voltage for the distribution $\\text{Uniform}(0,1)$.
