[{"file": "1601.02740.tex", "nexttext": "\nBy multiplying with a factor of $T/2$, the derived PSD becomes independent of $T$, and has a unit of (RMS$^2$/Hz).\nThe PSD is normalized by the square of the average intensity following \\citet{miyamoto1994}.\nIt is called normalized PSD (NPSD).\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Corrections for sampling and gap effects}\n\\label{psd_effect}\n\nThe MAXI data are not completely regular-sampled.\nSometimes data gaps are caused by sun avoidance, high particle background regions,\n small dead regions at the scan poles which move with the precession period of the orbit of the International Space Station, and other effects.\nTherefore, we interpolated each gap with a linear line, \nwhich connects the pre-gap intensity (averaged over 5 data points) and the post-gap value (also averaged over 5 data points) \\citep{sugimoto}.\nFurthermore, the derived PSDs are strongly affected by aliasing effects, because MAXI measures the intensity of an X-ray source only for $40\\sim 70$ s, every 5400 s period.\nThat is, each data point is a very short snapshot, with a long interval to the next (or from the preceding) sampling.\nAs a result, the MAXI light curves are generally sensitive to source variations not only on time scale longer than 5400 s, \nbut also to these in between $40\\sim 70$ s and $\\sim 5400$ s.\n\n\nIn order to correct the PSDs for the effects of gaps (hereafter gap effects), and those of the short exposure with long-interval sampling (hereafter sampling effects), \nwe simulated MAXI data of a variable source with specified variability.\nSince the PSD of Cyg X-1 can be approximated by a power-law with an index of $-1$ (\\cite{reig}; \\cite{chura}),\nthis form of PSD was employed as the input variability.\nFurther assuming that the phases of the Fourier components are random, \nwe produced a hundred fake light curves, each of which has 54 s time bin and covers the same time span as figure \\ref{fig:cygLC}.\nDetails of the PSD simulation are given in Appendix \\ref{gap}.\nThen, for each simulation run, we picked up one data point from every 100 bins (= 5400 s = one orbit) and discarded the 99 points \nto simulate the sampling effects, and applied the same observing window as for Cyg X-1 in order to reproduce the gap effects.\nInterpolating the gaps in the same way as for the actual data, a PSD was calculated from a fake light curve.\nFinally, we took an average of the 100 simulated PSDs, and normalized it to the assumed input PSD, to obtain the transfer function \n(in Fourier space; figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap} in Appendix \\ref{gap}) \nof the present MAXI observation of Cyg X-1.\nBelow, PSDs obtained from the observed data are divided by the transfer function thus obtained, \nin order to correct for the gap effects and the sampling effects.\nPrior to this division, we subtract the Poisson noise, \nwhich is estimated by a numerical simulation (Appendix \\ref{poisson}). \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Results (1): using the longest data length}\n\nFor both the LHS and HSS, we calculated NPSDs from the light curves in the three energy bands, 2--4 keV, 4--10 keV and 10--20 keV.\nIn calculation, the longest span of data was used for each state, \ni.e. 318 days for the LHS \nand 477 days for the HSS.\nThese data segments are shown in table \\ref{tb:hardem} (as No. 1-all) and table \\ref{tb:softem} (as No. 8-all), respectively, together with other shorter segments available. \nOnly the GSC data were used, because the SSC data are much more sparse than those of the GSC.\nIn the HSS, the selected span is shorter than Data No. 8 in table \\ref{tb:trans} because short data bunches at the beginning and the end of the span were removed.\nAfter subtracting the Poisson noise and correcting for \tthe gap and the sampling effects (section \\ref{psd_effect}), \nwe obtained NPSDs down to 3$\\times$10$^{-8}$ Hz as shown in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd}.\nThe error of each data point was obtained by propagating errors of the observed light curve.\nThe NPSDs extend roughly with a power-law shape down to 3$\\times$10$^{-8}$ Hz, \nbut they scatter largely in the low frequency ($\\leq 3\\times10^{-7}$ Hz) region.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Results (2): using shorter data lengths}\n\\label{psdresult2}\n\nBy shortening the data length to be used in a Fourier transform by equation (\\ref{eq:sincos}), \nwe can produce a larger number of NPSDs, and take their average. \nThe NPSD obtained in this way is expected to suffer smaller statistical errors, \nalthough it lacks the information in the lowest frequencies.\nThus, the data span was restricted to 40 and 43 days for the LHS and the HSS, respectively, to cover a frequency range down to $\\sim$ 3$\\times$10$^{-7}$ Hz \nat the sacrifice of the $3\\times$10$^{-8} - 3\\times$10$^{-7}$ Hz range.\nBy doing so, the fraction of data gaps was reduced from $\\sim$ 50 \\% to $\\sim$ 10\\%. \nAs listed in table \\ref{tb:hardem}, six data segments were extracted for the LHS, and eight data segments in table \\ref{tb:softem} for the HSS.\nThen, we converted these data segments individually into NPSDs, and took their averages, separately over the LHS and HSS.\nThe obtained ensemble-averaged NPSDs are shown in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}, where the vertical error bars represent the NPSD scatter (standard deviation) within each ensemble.\nIn figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}, ordinate employs power times frequency, \ninstead of power itself.\n\n\nAs expected, the NPSDs in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd} are less scattered even in the low frequency range\nbelow $10^{-6}$ Hz, and show similar structures in all the energy bands, \nalthough they could still be subject to some structures including shallow dips around $3\\times 10^{-6}$ Hz, \nand the weak tendency of flattening below $3\\times 10^{-7}$ Hz.\nAs shown by a simulation in Appendix \\ref{gap}, the possible flattening is unlikely to be caused by the data gaps.\nInstead, it could be within the scatter of NPSDs, \nconsidering that the effect is seen in only the lowest-frequency data points in both states.\t\nWe also note that the energy dependence in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} and figure \\ref{fig:avepsd} is slightly different.\nEspecially, the normalization of the 4--10 keV NPSD in the HSS in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} is higher\nthan that in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}.\nConsidering the ensemble-averaging procedure involved in the NPSDs in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}, \nwe regard them as better representing the Cyg X-1 variability than those in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\small\n\\caption{Data segments used in calculating NPSD in the LHSs.\n}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}[b]{c c c}\n\\hline\ndata

accretion, accretion disks---X-ray:general --- stars: individual: Cygnus X-1}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n\nLong-term X-ray variability of the black hole binary, Cygnus X-1, \nwas studied with five years of MAXI data from 2009 to 2014, which include \nsubstantial periods of the high/soft state, as well as the low/hard state. \nIn each state, Normalized Power Spectrum densities (NPSDs) were calculated in three energy bands of 2\u00e2\u0080\u0093-4 keV, 4\u00e2\u0080\u0093-10 keV and 10-\u00e2\u0080\u009320 keV. \nThe NPSDs in a frequency from $10^{-7}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz are all approximated by a power-law function with an index $-1.35\\sim -1.29$.\nThe fractional RMS variation $\\eta$,\ncalculated in the above frequency range,\nwas found to show the following three properties;\n(1) $\\eta$ slightly decreases with energy in the low/hard state;\n(2) $\\eta$  increases towards higher energies in the high/soft state;\nand (3) in the 10--20 keV band, $\\eta$ is 3 times higher\nin the high/soft state than in the low/hard state.\nThese properties were confirmed through studies of\nintensity-correlated changes of the MAXI spectra.\nOf these three findings,\nthe first one is consistent with that seen in the short-term variability during the LHS.\nThe latter two can be understood as a result of high variability\nof the hard-tail component seen in the high/soft state with the above very low frequency range,\nalthough the origin of the variability remains inconclusive.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nBlack-hole (BH) X-ray binaries emit X-rays through the mass accretion from their companion stars.\nThe matter accretes onto the BH forming an accretion disk, \nwhich is considered to work as an efficient energy-release engine.  \nThe properties of accretion disks have been studied by both theoretical and observational approaches.  \nFrom the theoretical studies, a disk is considered to evolve from the RIAF (Radiative Inefficient Accretion Flow ; \\cite{Ichimaru77, Narayan94}) state, \nthrough the standard-disk state \\citep{shakura}, up to the slim-disk state\n\\citep{abramowicz88}, as the accretion rate increases.  \nObservationally, galactic BH binaries show two spectral states, \nthe low/hard state (hereafter LHS) which is dominated  by a power-law spectrum, possibly corresponding to the RIAF,  \nand the high/soft state (hereafter HSS) which is dominated by an optically-thick thermal emission from an accretion disk, i.e. the standard-disk \\citep{tanaka,remillard2006,done}.\nIn the HSS, a hard tail component is seen in the energy spectrum, which often extends from 10 keV to several MeV by a power-law \\citep{gierlinski}.\nIn the LHS, there is also hard tail extending $\\sim 100$ keV with a clear cut-off,\nwhose origin is considered that thermal Comptonization of disk photons by hot plasma.\nThe origin of hard tail in the HSS is different from that in the LHS, and is still unknown.\n\n\nTime variations of the X-ray intensity are another important aspect of BH X-ray binaries.\nEspecially Cygnus X-1 (hereafter Cyg X-1), the leading galactic BH binary with an orbital period of 5.6 d,\nhas provided rich information on the short-term variability in both states (e.g. \\cite{chura, grinberg}).\nThe power spectrum density (PSD) in the LHS has a power-law shape with an index of about $-1$ in the frequency range from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-2}$ Hz.\nBetween 10$^{-2}$ Hz and 10$^{-1}$ Hz, the PSD is constant as a white noise. \nAbove 10$^{-1}$ Hz, the index returns to about $-1$.\nThere is a break again at around 1 Hz, above which the index becomes steeper (e.g., \\cite{belloni, nowak2000, negoro, pot}).\nThese time scales are thought to reflect the dynamics of accretion flows, and the process of \nenergy dissipation or particle acceleration in a vicinity of the BH.\nThe break at 1 Hz in the LHS can be interpreted as a decay time scale of individual shots, which appear in a light curve \\citep{negoro}.\nIn the HSS, the PSD is approximated by a power-law also with an index of  $-1$,\nbut this form continues, without flattening, from $10^{-4}$ Hz up to 20 Hz, beyond which it steepens.\nThe PSD extending with a constant index $-1$ suggests that the accretion flows in the HSS have no characteristic time scales over the $10^{-4}$ -- 20 Hz range.\n\\citet{chura} explained the overall shape of the PSD in the LHS and the HSS of Cyg X-1 with \na phenomenological model that the optically-thick disk is sandwiched by optically-thin accretion flows extending up to a large distance from the BH. \nIn the LHS the optically-thick disk is truncated at some distances from the BH, \nturning into optically-thin and geometrically thick accretion flows \\citep{makishima}. \n\n\nOn frequencies lower than $\\sim 10^{-4}$ Hz (time scales of 0.1 d), \nthe variability of Cyg X-1 has been studied mainly by applying PSD analyses to the data obtained with RXTE observations. \n\\citet{reig} calculated PSDs of Cyg X-1 using more than eleven years of data obtained with the RXTE/ASM.\nThey showed that PSDs in the $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-5}$ Hz range can be expressed by a power-law with an index of $-1$, \nand that the PSDs depend on the energy (over 1.3 -- 12.2 keV) \nby a factor of 3 $\\sim$ 5.\nThe long-term variability of hard X-rays from Cyg X-1 was studied by \\citet{Vikhlinin94}, down to 4$\\times$10$^{-4}$ Hz, using  the GRANAT/SIGMA data.\nThey detected a very low frequency QPO (Quasi-Periodic Oscillation) around  0.04--0.07 Hz.\nHowever, on frequencies of $\\ltsim 10^{-4}$ Hz, our understanding of Cyg X-1 variability has remained much poorer, \nespecially in the HSS, \nthan the rich information accumulated on the short-term variability. \n\n\nThe Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) obtained a long-term light curve of Cyg X-1 for more than five years.\nThe object had been in the LHS until 2010 June, \nand after that it stayed mainly in the HSS \\citep{Negoro10}. \nBy analyzing PSDs and energy spectra from this unique data set, we investigated the characteristics of long-term variations of Cyg X-1 in both states.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Observation}\n\\label{sec:obs}\nThe data of Cyg X-1 to be analyzed here were obtained with MAXI (\\cite{matsuoka}), \nwhich is attached to the International Space Station.\nAs the International Space Station orbits the earth in every 92 min, MAXI scans over nearly the entire sky with two kinds of X-ray cameras: \nthe Gas Slit Camera (GSC: \\cite{mihara}) covering the energy band of 2--20 keV,\nand the Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC: \\cite{tomida}) covering 0.7--7 keV.\n\nFrom the MAXI home page \\footnote{\\url{http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.php?cid=1&jname=J1958+352}}, we downloaded one-day bin and 90-minute bin archival data of Cyg X-1.\nThese archival data were selected on the condition that X-ray incident angle to a camera is smaller than 38 $^\\circ$ and scan times of the source and the background are both longer than 15 s.\nEnergy spectra of the GSC and SSC were processed by the MAXI on-demand data web page\\footnote{\\url{http://maxi.riken.jp/mxondem/}} (\\cite{nakahira}).\nWe selected $2^{\\circ}.0$ for a source region and $3^{\\circ}.0$ for a background region.\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:cygLC} shows one-day bin light curves of Cyg X-1 obtained with the GSC from 2009 August 15 (MJD = 55058) to 2014 November 9 (MJD = 56970),\nin three energy bands (2--4 keV, 4--10 keV and 10--20 keV).\nTime histories of two kinds of hardness ratios (HR), $I$(4--10 keV)/$I$(2--4 keV) and $I$(10--20 keV)/$I$(4--10 keV), are also plotted.\nThe state of Cyg X-1 can be recognized by the values of the HR.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{3bandlc_clean.eps}\\\\\n   \\vspace{1cm}\n   \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{hkklc4_h-s_2dan_log_lin_3d.eps}\n

2009 August, Cyg X-1 was in the LHS for about ten months.\nAt around MJD = 55378, the source made a transition to the HSS, where it stayed for another ten months.\nAfter several times of state transitions, it has been mainly in the HSS since MJD = 56078.\n\n\n\\section{Analysis and results}\n\\subsection{Definition of spectral states}\nAs shown in the HR histories in figure \\ref{fig:cygLC}, Cyg X-1 exhibited distinct LHS and HSS.\nSince the two HR histories have the same trend, we hereafter use the $I$(4--10 keV)/$I$(2--4 keV) ratio, which has better statistics. \nThe top panel of figure \\ref{fig:cygHDI} shows a hardness-intensity diagram.\nThus the two states are clearly separated.\nThe bottom panel in figure \\ref{fig:cygHDI} shows a histogram of the HR, \nwhich exhibits two clear peaks corresponding to the HSS and the LHS.\nWe fit the histogram with two gaussian functions and determined their mean values and standard deviations.\nThen we defined the boundaries of each state as 3$\\sigma$ from the gaussian center, i.e.\nHR$<$0.43 for the HSS and 0.48$<$HR for the LHS.\n\nFrom figure \\ref{fig:cygLC} and figure \\ref{fig:cygHDI}, the periods of the

observed long-term variations,\nwe analyzed energy spectra of Cyg X-1 obtained with the MAXI/GSC and the SSC.\nWe used the same periods as in the PSD analysis,\ni.e. from MJD = 55058 to MJD = 55376 for the LHS,\nand from MJD = 56130 to MJD = 56607 for the HSS.\nThe SSC data, available only for about one third of the time, were also incorporated.\n\n\nIn section \\ref{sec:psd}, we found that the long-term variability of Cyg X-1,\nparticularly in the HSS, is significantly energy dependent.\nTo reconfirm the implied spectral variation in this frequency range,\nwe divided the observed data into bright and faint periods\nby comparing the individual one-day GSC intensities in 2--20 keV with their 15-day running averages.\nSince the 15-day time scale corresponds to a frequency of $8\\times 10^{-7}$ Hz, \nthis procedure means an extraction of time variations longer than $8\\times 10^{-7}$ Hz.\nThen, eight spectra in total were produced;\nthe GSC and SSC data in the bright and faint periods, from the LHS and HSS.\nThe background-subtracted eight MAXI spectra obtained in this way are shown in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp}.\nThus, as expected, the HSS spectra are much softer than those of the LHS,\nin good agreement with the general understanding of the spectral states.\nFor reference, these spectra include periods of increased low-energy absorption (seen as dips in the 2--4 keV light curves), \nwhich often appear for $\\sim 15\\%$ of the orbital phase.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[hptb]\n  \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{hard_unfolded.eps}   \n\n

panels are residuals from the model.}\n\\label{fig:cygespeccomp}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nTo better visualize the intensity-correlated spectral changes in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp},\nwe present, in figure \\ref{fig:pha},\nthe ratios of the GSC spectrum in the bright period to that in the faint period.\nThe SSC data are not shown here, because the errors are large.\nIn the LHS, the ratio decreases slightly with energy,\nwhereas the HSS ratio increases significantly towards higher energies.\nTo quantify these spectral results and examine their consistency with table \\ref{tb:rms},\nwe  calculated the ratio $R$ of the photon flux in the bright period $F_{\\rm b}$ to that in the faint period $F_{\\rm f}$, and show the results in table \\ref{tb:specrms}. \nWe may express $R$ as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 22996, "prevtext": "\nBy multiplying with a factor of $T/2$, the derived PSD becomes independent of $T$, and has a unit of (RMS$^2$/Hz).\nThe PSD is normalized by the square of the average intensity following \\citet{miyamoto1994}.\nIt is called normalized PSD (NPSD).\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Corrections for sampling and gap effects}\n\\label{psd_effect}\n\nThe MAXI data are not completely regular-sampled.\nSometimes data gaps are caused by sun avoidance, high particle background regions,\n small dead regions at the scan poles which move with the precession period of the orbit of the International Space Station, and other effects.\nTherefore, we interpolated each gap with a linear line, \nwhich connects the pre-gap intensity (averaged over 5 data points) and the post-gap value (also averaged over 5 data points) \\citep{sugimoto}.\nFurthermore, the derived PSDs are strongly affected by aliasing effects, because MAXI measures the intensity of an X-ray source only for $40\\sim 70$ s, every 5400 s period.\nThat is, each data point is a very short snapshot, with a long interval to the next (or from the preceding) sampling.\nAs a result, the MAXI light curves are generally sensitive to source variations not only on time scale longer than 5400 s, \nbut also to these in between $40\\sim 70$ s and $\\sim 5400$ s.\n\n\nIn order to correct the PSDs for the effects of gaps (hereafter gap effects), and those of the short exposure with long-interval sampling (hereafter sampling effects), \nwe simulated MAXI data of a variable source with specified variability.\nSince the PSD of Cyg X-1 can be approximated by a power-law with an index of $-1$ (\\cite{reig}; \\cite{chura}),\nthis form of PSD was employed as the input variability.\nFurther assuming that the phases of the Fourier components are random, \nwe produced a hundred fake light curves, each of which has 54 s time bin and covers the same time span as figure \\ref{fig:cygLC}.\nDetails of the PSD simulation are given in Appendix \\ref{gap}.\nThen, for each simulation run, we picked up one data point from every 100 bins (= 5400 s = one orbit) and discarded the 99 points \nto simulate the sampling effects, and applied the same observing window as for Cyg X-1 in order to reproduce the gap effects.\nInterpolating the gaps in the same way as for the actual data, a PSD was calculated from a fake light curve.\nFinally, we took an average of the 100 simulated PSDs, and normalized it to the assumed input PSD, to obtain the transfer function \n(in Fourier space; figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap} in Appendix \\ref{gap}) \nof the present MAXI observation of Cyg X-1.\nBelow, PSDs obtained from the observed data are divided by the transfer function thus obtained, \nin order to correct for the gap effects and the sampling effects.\nPrior to this division, we subtract the Poisson noise, \nwhich is estimated by a numerical simulation (Appendix \\ref{poisson}). \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Results (1): using the longest data length}\n\nFor both the LHS and HSS, we calculated NPSDs from the light curves in the three energy bands, 2--4 keV, 4--10 keV and 10--20 keV.\nIn calculation, the longest span of data was used for each state, \ni.e. 318 days for the LHS \nand 477 days for the HSS.\nThese data segments are shown in table \\ref{tb:hardem} (as No. 1-all) and table \\ref{tb:softem} (as No. 8-all), respectively, together with other shorter segments available. \nOnly the GSC data were used, because the SSC data are much more sparse than those of the GSC.\nIn the HSS, the selected span is shorter than Data No. 8 in table \\ref{tb:trans} because short data bunches at the beginning and the end of the span were removed.\nAfter subtracting the Poisson noise and correcting for \tthe gap and the sampling effects (section \\ref{psd_effect}), \nwe obtained NPSDs down to 3$\\times$10$^{-8}$ Hz as shown in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd}.\nThe error of each data point was obtained by propagating errors of the observed light curve.\nThe NPSDs extend roughly with a power-law shape down to 3$\\times$10$^{-8}$ Hz, \nbut they scatter largely in the low frequency ($\\leq 3\\times10^{-7}$ Hz) region.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Results (2): using shorter data lengths}\n\\label{psdresult2}\n\nBy shortening the data length to be used in a Fourier transform by equation (\\ref{eq:sincos}), \nwe can produce a larger number of NPSDs, and take their average. \nThe NPSD obtained in this way is expected to suffer smaller statistical errors, \nalthough it lacks the information in the lowest frequencies.\nThus, the data span was restricted to 40 and 43 days for the LHS and the HSS, respectively, to cover a frequency range down to $\\sim$ 3$\\times$10$^{-7}$ Hz \nat the sacrifice of the $3\\times$10$^{-8} - 3\\times$10$^{-7}$ Hz range.\nBy doing so, the fraction of data gaps was reduced from $\\sim$ 50 \\% to $\\sim$ 10\\%. \nAs listed in table \\ref{tb:hardem}, six data segments were extracted for the LHS, and eight data segments in table \\ref{tb:softem} for the HSS.\nThen, we converted these data segments individually into NPSDs, and took their averages, separately over the LHS and HSS.\nThe obtained ensemble-averaged NPSDs are shown in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}, where the vertical error bars represent the NPSD scatter (standard deviation) within each ensemble.\nIn figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}, ordinate employs power times frequency, \ninstead of power itself.\n\n\nAs expected, the NPSDs in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd} are less scattered even in the low frequency range\nbelow $10^{-6}$ Hz, and show similar structures in all the energy bands, \nalthough they could still be subject to some structures including shallow dips around $3\\times 10^{-6}$ Hz, \nand the weak tendency of flattening below $3\\times 10^{-7}$ Hz.\nAs shown by a simulation in Appendix \\ref{gap}, the possible flattening is unlikely to be caused by the data gaps.\nInstead, it could be within the scatter of NPSDs, \nconsidering that the effect is seen in only the lowest-frequency data points in both states.\t\nWe also note that the energy dependence in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} and figure \\ref{fig:avepsd} is slightly different.\nEspecially, the normalization of the 4--10 keV NPSD in the HSS in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} is higher\nthan that in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}.\nConsidering the ensemble-averaging procedure involved in the NPSDs in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}, \nwe regard them as better representing the Cyg X-1 variability than those in figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\small\n\\caption{Data segments used in calculating NPSD in the LHSs.\n}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}[b]{c c c}\n\\hline\ndata

}\n\\label{fig:avepsd}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nAs seen in figure \\ref{fig:avepsd},\nthe NPSD slope does not appear to depend significantly either on the spectral state or the energy band.\nTo confirm this suggestion, we fitted the individual NPDSs with a power-law, over a frequency range of $10^{-6}$ and $9.2\\times10^{-5}$ Hz.\nThen, the 18 NPSDs before taking ensemble averages (6 segments times 3 energy bands) in the LHS gave an average slope and the associated RMS scatter as $-1.35\\pm 0.29$, \nwhereas the 24 HSS ones (8 segments times 3 energy bands) gave $-1.29 \\pm 0.23$.\nTherefore, the NPSD slope is consistent with being independent of the state.\nIn addition, slope differences among the 3 energy bands are at most within the scatter of $\\sim 0.3$ (in the LHS) and $\\sim 0.2$ (in the HSS).\n\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:avepsd} reveals two more important properties. \nOne is that the NPSD normalizations in the HSS are significantly energy dependent, increasing towards higher energies, \nwhereas those in the LHS show a much weaker and opposite trend.\nThe other is that Cyg X-1 is much more variable, at least above 4 keV, on the relevant time scales while it is in the HSS than in the LHS.\nTo quantify these properties, \nwe integrated the 6 (3 energy bands times two states) ensemble-averaged NPSDs from $10^{-6}$ to $9.2\\times10^{-5}$ Hz,\nand derived individually the fractional RMS variation $\\eta$ as \n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\eta = \\sqrt{2\\Delta f \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{F}}NPSD(f_i)}\n\\label{eq:rms}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math

\\caption{Ratios of the GSC spectra in the bright period to that in the faint period,\n  in the LHS (left panel), and in the HSS (right panel).\n  }\n\\label{fig:pha}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nTo understand the physical origin of the behavior seen in figure \\ref{fig:pha},\nas well as in table \\ref{tb:rms} and table \\ref{tb:specrms}, we proceeded to simultaneous model fitting to the 2--20 keV GSC spectrum\nand the 0.7--7 keV SSC spectrum.\nThe 1.5--2 keV range of the SSC was excluded\nto avoid the known systematic uncertainty in the effective area (\\cite{tomida}).\nFirst, we employed a model composed of a multi-color disk ({\\em diskbb}) model (\\cite{shakura, mitsuda}) for the low-energy part,\nand a power-law ({\\em powerlaw}) as a hard tail.\nThis model has often been used in the previous studies of BH X-ray binaries including Cyg X-1 (e.g. \\cite{dotani}).\nThe photo-electric absorption model ({\\em phabs}) with abundances by \\citet{anders}\nand the Fe-K emission line model ({\\em gaussian}) were incorporated.\nThe model then becomes {\\em phabs$\\times$(diskbb+powerlaw+gaussian)} in the Xspec (\\cite{arnaud96}) terminology; \nhereafter, we call it {\\em diskbb+powerlaw} model.\nThe innermost radius of {\\em diskbb} is derived as $r_{\\rm{in}} = D\\sqrt{N_{\\rm{diskbb}}/\\cos{i}}$,\nwhere $N_{\\rm{diskbb}}$ is the normalization of the {\\em diskbb} model.\nThe distance $D$ from the earth and the inclination angle $i$ from our line of sight\nwere adopted to be 1.86 kpc and 27$^{\\circ}$, respectively \\citep{orosz}.\nThe hydrogen column density $N_{\\rm H}$ and the gaussian parameters\nwere constrained to be common between the faint and the bright spectra  in each state,\nbut were allowed to differ between the two states.\n\n\nThe fit has been approximately successful,\nand yielded the best-fit parameters as summarized in table \\ref{tb:especpow}.\nThus, in both states, the  {\\em diskbb} parameters are the same, within errors,\nbetween the bright and faint spectra.\nIn the LHS, the {\\em powerlaw} index is steeper in the bright spectrum than in the faint one,\nwhile the opposite trend is found in  the HSS.\nThese are consistent with the spectral ratio shown in figure \\ref{fig:pha}.\nThe $r_{\\rm in}$ value for the LHS is consistent with that from a previous work \\citep{yamada}.\nOn the other hand,  that for the HSS is smaller than that reported, e.g., in \\citet{dotani} (even after corrections for the distance and the mass),\npresumably because the luminosity in the present result\nis roughly half  those in typical HSS observations made previously \\citep{zhang}.\n\nReferring to equation (\\ref{eq:eta}), we calculated $\\eta'$ also for the {\\em powerlaw} component only, and show the results in table \\ref{tb:specrms}. \nA comparison of the two values of $\\eta'$, one from the entire photon counts while the other from the {\\em powerlaw} contribution, \nreveals that the overall source variability in $> 4$ keV is determined solely by the power law variation, \nin agreement with the spectral decomposition in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp} (right).\nIn the 2--4 keV band, in contrast, the overall  $\\eta'$ is reduced to $\\sim 60\\%$  of the {\\em powerlaw} variability; \nthis effect is readily attributed to the presence of the stable disk component.\nIn addition, table \\ref{tb:specrms} reveals slight increase of  $\\eta'$ (both total and {\\em powerlaw}) from the 10-\u00e2\u0080\u009320 keV to 4--10 keV bands.\nThe behavior of $\\eta'$ agrees with that of $\\eta$ in table \\ref{tb:rms} and means that the {\\em powerlaw} slope slightly hardens as it gets stronger, \nas visualized in figure \\ref{fig:pha} (right) and quantified in the fitting results in table \\ref{tb:especpow}.\nThis finding is not necessarily consistent, however,  with previous reports on Cyg X-1 in the HSS (e.g., \\cite{jourdain}) and other HSS sources (e.g., \\cite{koyama}),\nthat the hard-tail slope is relatively independent of the source intensity.\nIt is possible that the present HSS was somewhat atypical, \nbecause the values of $\\Gamma \\sim 2.9$ we measured is steeper than those ( $\\Gamma \\sim 2.4$; \\cite{dotani}) observed from these BHBs in their typical HSS.\n\n\n\nFor a further analysis, we replaced the {\\em powerlaw} with a more realistic model {\\em nthComp} (\\cite{zdziarski}), which represents Compton \nscattering of some soft photons by hot electrons ({\\em diskbb+nthComp} model).\nThe seed photon source was set to be the {\\em diskbb} component representing the disk emission.\nSince the electron temperature $T_{\\rm e}$ of the {\\em nthComp} model cannot be determined with our data, we fixed it to a \ntypical value of 100 keV \\citet{Sunyaev79, makishima}. \nThe best-fit parameters are summarized in table \\ref{tb:especcomp} and the best-fit models are shown in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp}.\nThe fits are not yet formally acceptable, but the model, as shown in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp}, reasonably reproduces the spectra from 0.7 keV to 20 keV. \t\t\nIn this modeling, the disk photons are partially fed into {\\em nthComp}, \nso that the parameter $r_{\\rm in}$ in the {\\em diskbb} model is smaller than the true inner radius which is denoted $R_{\\rm in}$ hereafter. \nThis $R_{\\rm in}$ was calculated from the sum of 0.01--100 keV photon flux of the {\\em diskbb} component, $F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{disk}}$, \nand that of nthComp component, $F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{nth}}$, utilizing the innermost temperature $T_{\\rm in}$ of {\\em diskbb} and the equation by \\citet{kubota} as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\lefteqn{F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{disk}}+F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{nth}}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lefteqn{= 0.0165\\Biggl[\\frac{R_{\\rm{in}}^2\\cos{i}}{(D/10\\ \\rm{kpc})^2}\\Biggr]\\Biggl(\\frac{T_{\\rm{in}}}{1\\ \\rm{keV}}\\Biggr)^3\\ \\ \\rm{ph}\\ \\rm{s}^{-1}\\ \\rm{cm}^{-2}.} \\label{eq:r}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe derived values of $R_{\\rm in}$, shown in table \\ref{tb:especcomp}, are indeed larger than $r_{\\rm in}$ in table \\ref{tb:especpow} \n(although we do not discuss absolute values of $R_{\\rm in}$).\nThe LHS is characterized by about twice larger $R_{\\rm in}$ than the HSS, \nimplying a disk truncation in the LHS as noted before \\citep{makishima, yamada}.\nFinally, in either state, the disk parameters ($T_{\\rm in}$ and $R_{\\rm in}$) are found to be apparently constant as the source varies.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\small\n\\caption{The flux

obtained with MAXI, we derived the NPSDs of Cyg X-1 in its LHS and HSS from $10^{-7}$ Hz to 10$^{-4}$ Hz in the three energy bands.\nIt is of particular importance that the long-term variations in the two states were studied in a unified way \nusing the same instrument, with the same analysis method, \nand under similar data statistics.\nIn addition, the long-term NPSD in the HSS was obtained for the first time thanks to a fortunate opportunity that Cyg X-1 stayed in the HSS in most of the time since 2010 June.\nThese results on the HSS are expected to provide some clues to the still unknown origin of the hard-tail component, \nwhich is nearly always observed in this spectral state.\n\n\nIn the LHS, the NPSD down to $10^{-7}$ Hz obeys a power-law, and  is approximately expressed as an extrapolation of the NPSD above 0.01 Hz \\citep{pot, nowak}.\nWe found that the NPSD in the low (2--4 keV) energy band is slightly larger than those in the 4--10 and 10--20 keV bands \n(figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} left, figure \\ref{fig:avepsd} left, and table \\ref{tb:rms}).\n\n\nThe newly obtained $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ Hz NPSD in the HSS is also approximated by a power-law, \nand on an extrapolation of the NPSD previously obtained in frequencies above 10$^{-4}$ Hz \\citep{chura, cui1997}.\nThe NPSD (RMS$^2$/mean$^2$ Hz$^{-1}$) in the HSS is about one order of magnitude larger than that in the LHS in 10--20 keV.  \nThis differs from the case of other BH binaries reported by \\citet{miyamoto1993}, although their data were limited to higher frequency range above 0.01 Hz.\nIn the HSS, the NPSD from $10^{-7}$ Hz to 10$^{-4}$ Hz has an energy dependence in such a way that it is 5$\\sim$6 times higher in the 10--20 keV band than that in the low energy band (2--4 keV).  \nThis finding extends the results of energy dependence in 0.2--200 Hz reported by \\citet{grinberg}. \nThese energy dependences of the long-term variation in the HSS were reconfirmed via the spectral analysis in section \\ref{energy}.\n\n\n\nIn the present paper,  \nwe used only the MAXI data \nbecause the energy band is suitable for simultaneous analyzing the variations of the disk component and the power-law component.\nIn order to further study the hard tail variability, \nthe Swift/BAT data with good statistic above 20 keV should be utilized: \nwe consider that this is our future task.\n\n\n\\subsection{Comparison with short-term variability}\nSince the first discovery by \\citet{oda}, the aperiodic fast X-ray variation of Cyg X-1 has been\ninvestigated by a number of authors (e.g., \\cite{negoro1994}, \\cite{chura}),\nmainly in the LHS and typically over $10^{-3}-10^2$ Hz frequency range.\nSimilar studies have been performed on other BHBs as well, including in particular GX 339-4 (\\cite{maejima}; \\cite{miyamoto1994}).\nGiven these, let us briefly compare the present studies with the previous results on the short-term variability of Cyg X-1.\n\nOur results on the LHS has two similarities to the short-term variability in the same state.\nOne is the PSD slope, which is $\\sim 1.4$ over $10^{-7}-10^{-2}$ Hz and $\\sim 1$ in the $>10^{-1}$ Hz range (figure \\ref{fig:hkkchura}).\nThe other is the energy dependence; on both time scales, $\\eta$ decreases slowly towards higher energies, \nimplying ``softer when brighter\" characteristic, \nwhich Cyg X-1 shows when it is above $\\sim 1\\%$ of the Eddington luminosity.\nFor example, \\citet{grinberg} reported that the 0.125--256 Hz variation of Cyg X-1 in the LHS is about twice higher in 2.1--4.5 keV than in 5.7--9.4 keV,\nin approximate agreement with our table \\ref{tb:rms}.\nAlso, the Suzaku result obtained in the LHS,\nnamely, figure 8b of \\citet{makishima},\nreveals a similar energy dependence.\nThese two resemblances altogether suggest a common mechanism working on these very wide range of time scales.\nFor example, the higher short-term variability in softer energy bands may be a result of spectral softening as individual ``shots\" develop \n\\citep{negoro1994, yamadashot}.\nHowever, the phenomenon cannot be completely self-similar, since the PSD shows a considerable flattening over the $10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ range.\n\nThe fast variability in the HSS has been considerably less studied than that in the LHS.\nNevertheless, \nwe can point out again two similarities between the long-term vs. short-term variations.\nOne is that our NPSD index in the HSS ($\\sim 1.3$) is similar to the short-term HSS index of $\\sim 1$ by \\citet{cui1997}, \nas clearly seen figure \\ref{fig:hkkchura}.\nThe other is the energy dependence; the slight increase of variability from the 4--10 keV to 10--20 keV ranges \n(subsection \\ref{psdresult2} and section \\ref{energy}) \nis also observed in short-term results by \\citet{grinberg}.\t\nAs already described, this ``harder when brighter\" property is opposite to the behavior, ``softer when brighter\", in the LHS.\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral variation}\n\nThe energy spectrum in the LHS is known to be approximated by a power-law with a high-energy cutoff around 100 keV (e.g., \\cite{makishima}).  \nThis is interpreted by a scenario that an optically-thick standard disk \\citep{shakura} is truncated at some distance \nfrom the BH and an optically-thin accretion flow (or a corona) is formed around the BH \\citep{esin}.  \nHigh temperature electrons, in the optically-thin corona, up-scatter seed photons presumably from the outer standard disk.\nIn this frame work, the fast hard X-ray variability in the LHS may be explained by considering \nthat the corona covers a variable fraction of the disk \\citep{makishima}; \nwhen this fraction increases, \nthe source gets brighter, \nand softer due to the enhanced Compton cooling of the corona.\nIn fact, the MAXI spectrum accumulated over the LHS (figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp} left) was described successfully with the two component model, \nconsisting of a low-temperature {\\em diskbb} \\citep{mitsuda} representing the emission from such a truncated standard disk, \nand the {\\em powerlaw}  or the {\\em nthComp} representing the Compton up-scattered component.\n\nLike in many other reports on BHBs in the HSS, the MAXI spectrum in the HSS has been expressed by a dominant optically-thick thermal spectrum, \naccompanied by a {\\em powerlaw} component extending into higher energies.\nThe former is again interpreted by an emission from a standard-disk \\citep{shakura}, which is now considered to extend down to \nthe innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the BH.  \nThis is supported by the fact that the obtained inner disk radii in the HSS do not differ significantly between the faint and bright periods.\nLike the overall hard X-ray emission in the LHS, \nthe hard {\\em powerlaw} component in the HSS could also be a Compton up-scatters component produced by some hot electrons \n\\citep{cui1998, gierlinski}, but details are still unclear.\n\n\nIn order to better understand the NPSD results, we fitted the spectra by a model composed of a {\\em diskbb}, and the {\\em powerlaw} or the {\\em nthComp}, \nand studied how the spectrum changes as the source varies on frequencies range below $8\\times 10^{-7}$ Hz.\nThe obtained results, fully consistent with those from the NPSD studies, can be summarized into the following four points.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item[1] In  both states, the {\\em powerlaw} component is responsible for the observed long-term intensity variations, while the disk emission is essentially constant.\n\n\\item[2] The power-law component in the HSS is concluded to be more variable, on this frequency range, than that in the LHS.\n\n\\item[3] The decreasing variability towards higher energies, observed in the LHS, can be attributed mostly to the ``softer when brighter\" property of the {\\em powerlaw} component.\n\n\\item[4] The variability increase with energies in the HSS results from a combination of the two effects,\nnamely, the ``harder when brighter\" property of the {\\em powerlaw} component in this state, and the presence of the stable disk emission at lower energies.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\nSimilarly high long-term variations were observed also from some BH transients, \nincluding GS 1124$-$684 and GS 2000+25 \\citep{tanaka, terada}.\nWhen their outburst decline was followed by sparse snap-shot observation with Ginga, the intensity of the disk component changed smoothly, \nbut the power-law component varied largely from one observation to the next.\nThus, high long-term variability of the hard component in the HSS may be common to all BH binaries, \nincluding persistent and transient sources.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Origin of the time variation}\n\nLet us discuss the origin of the long-term variations which we detected down to $10^{-7}$ Hz.\nThe simplest possibility would be that  fluctuations in\nthe overall mass transfer rate from the companion star\nproduce the observed long-term X-ray variations.\nGenerally, the mass transfer in Cyg X-1 is thought to\noccur via capture of the stellar winds from the super giant companion star, HDE226868.\nThe winds are considered inhomogeneous as reported by several authors \\citep{Conti89,GiesBolton86,Hanke09},\nand as evidenced by variable X-ray absorption episodes\naround the superior conjunctions of the BH \\citep{kitamoto, remillard1984, church1997}.\nTherefore, the mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}$ must fluctuate,\nand could produce the long-term variability.\nHowever, besides the issue of how these fluctuations can propagate\nto the X-ray emission regions (see below),\nit is not trivial to explain with this scenario\nthe difference in the variation ($\\eta$ and $\\eta'$)\nobserved between the LHS and HSS.\n\n\n\n\nThe observed long-term X-ray variations may alternatively arise\nwhen some  fluctuations in $\\dot{M}$,\nproduced spontaneously in the accretion flow at various radii,\npropagate to the BH vicinity.\nAt a radius $r$ from the BH,\nsuch spontaneous fluctuations\nmay generally take place\non a time scale comparable to the thermal time scale\n$t_{\\rm th}=(\\alpha \\Omega_{\\rm K})^{-1}$,\nor the dynamical time scale $t_{\\rm d} = (\\Omega_{\\rm K})^{-1}$,\nwhere $\\Omega_{\\rm K}$ is the Keplerian angular velocity at $r$\nand $\\alpha$ is the viscosity parameter.\nSuch variations can propagate toward the center\nonly if their time scales are longer than the viscous time scale,\ngiven as $t_{\\rm v}=(\\alpha \\Omega_{\\rm K})^{-1}(r/H)^{2}$,\nwhere $H$ is the disk half thickness.\nIn an optically thick and geometrically thin  disk,\nthis $t_{\\rm v}$ is much longer than $t_{\\rm th}$ and $t_{\\rm d}$ because $H \\ll r$.\nTherefore, variations in $\\dot{M}$ produced at any outer radii,\n being strongly dissipated, would not propagate down to the X-ray emitting region.\nHowever, if some fraction of $\\dot{M}$ streams through\na geometrically-thick ($H\\sim r$) and optically-thin flow,\nin which  we expect $t_{\\rm v} \\sim t_{\\rm th}$,\nthe fluctuations produced at various larger radii can propagate inwards,\nand cause the X-ray intensity to vary on a wide range of time scales.\nThis idea was invoked by \\citet{chura} to explain\nthe X-ray variations on  timescales down to $10^{-4}$ Hz.\nWe may extend this two-flow scenario from the time scale of $10^{-4}$ Hz to $10^{-7}$ Hz,\nidentifying the optically-thick part with the standard accretion disk,\nand assuming that the optically-thin part\ndevelops into the Comptonizing corona in a vicinity of the BH.\nAssuming a $15~M_{\\odot}$ BH and $\\alpha = 0.01$,\nthe observed time scale of $t_{\\rm th} \\sim 10^{7}$ s\ncan be explained if the optically-thin flow starts\nat $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{12}$ cm ($\\sim 6 \\times 10^{5} R_{\\rm s}$).\nFurthermore, as detailed in Appendix \\ref{mdot},\nthe larger long-term variability in the HSS can be explained\nif  the fraction of $\\dot{M}$ through the optically-thin part\ncarries $\\sim 0.5~\\dot{M}$ in the HSS,\nwhile $\\sim 0.2~\\dot{M}$ in the LHS.\n\n\nAlthough the two-flow picture, as constructed above after \\citet{chura},\ncan account for essential features of the observed long-term variability of Cyg X-1,\nit is still subject to a few issues to be solved.\nOne is that the required size of the optically-thin flow is comparable\nto the binary size of Cyg X-1 (0.2 AU).\nIt is not obvious whether such a large-scale optically-thin flow\ncan be actually created by possible candidate mechanisms,\nsuch as X-ray irradiation, vertical magnetic pressure,\nand initial scatter in the specific angular momentum of accepting blobs.\nEven if such a flow is produced,\nit is not obvious whether its low density can be compensated by its higher radial velocity,\nto  carry a considerable fraction of the total $\\dot{M}$.\nFurthermore, we need to assume that the state difference,\nwhich is usually thought to be triggered at close vicinities of the BH,\nis already present at such large radii:\nit is not clear, either,\nwhether some feedback mechanisms (e.g., X-ray irradiation)\ncan control large-scale accretion flows in the required manner.\n\nAt present, we cannot conclude for sure \nwhether the observed slow variations in the HSS can be explained by either the stellar wind fluctuation or the two-flow picture.\nWe might need to consider other origins of the slow variability,\nincluding their production at regions much closer to the BH.\nFurther discussion is beyond the scope of the present paper:\nalthough our ultimate goal is to identify the origin of the long-term variation, \nthe currently available data information is still insufficient for that purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nBy  analyzing the three-band (2--4, 4--10 and 10--20 keV) MAXI data accumulated over 5 years,\nwe studied characteristics of the long term X-ray variation of Cyg X-1\nover the frequency range of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ Hz.\nThe long-term NPSD in the HSS was obtained for the first time.\nBy treating the LHS and the HSS data separately \nbut in the same manner, \nthe following results have been obtained.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \nIn the LHS and HSS, the index of the NPSD was obtained as $-1.35\\pm 0.29$ and $-1.29\\pm 0.23$, respectively.\nThey are consistent with those previously measured in the frequency range above 10$^{-3}$ Hz.\n\n\\item \nIn the 4--10 keV, and 10--20 keV bands, the fractional RMS variation $\\eta$ observed in the HSS was\n$\\sim 2$ and $\\sim 3$ times higher, respectively, than those measured in the LHS in the corresponding energies.\nIn the 2--4 keV band, $\\eta$ in the HSS was comparable to that in the LHS.\n\n\\item \nIn the LHS, $\\eta$ weakly decreased towards higher energies.\nThis property is consistent with that seen in the short-term variability during the LHS.\n\n\\item \nIn the HSS, $\\eta$ was found to increase significantly with energy,\nas a combination of  the following two effects.\nOne is that the disk component is stable while the hard tail varies.\nThe other is that the hard tail slope flattens as it becomes brighter.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nWe have studied long-term variability of the hard tail component in the HSS.\nThis will provide important clues to the yet unidentified origin of this emission component.\n\n\n\n\nThis work was supported by RIKEN Junior Research Associate Program.\nThis work was  also partially supported by \nthe Ministry of Education,

How to simulate a MAXI/GSC light curve}\n\nTo estimate effects of the data gaps and the sampling windows in our Cyg X-1 observation with the MAXI/GSC,  \nwe make a simulated light curve in units of (counts s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$), \nwhose PSD has a form of $Af^{-1}$.\nThe normalization $A$ is chosen to be close to what has actually been observed with the MAXI/GSC.\nLet us assume first that the observation is continuous with each data bin having a length $\\Delta t$, \nand set it equal to a typical source transit time, $t_{\\rm scan} = 54$ s.\nAccording to the method described in \\citet{Isobe} and \\citet{Timmer}, the count rate $a_i$ at the $i$-th bin is generated as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\na_{i} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N\\Delta t}}\\sum^{N_{F}-1}_{j=0}\\{c_{i}(f_{j}) + s_{i}(f_{j})\\} & \\rm{(counts~~s^{-1}~~cm^{-2})} \\nonumber \\\\\n                                                       & \\label{eq:A} \\\\\nc_{i}(f_{j}) = R_{{\\rm cos},j}\\cos(2\\pi f_{j}t_{i})   & \\nonumber \\\\\ns_{i}(f_{j}) = R_{{\\rm sin},j}\\sin(2\\pi f_{j}t_{i})   & \\nonumber \\\\\nt_{i} = i\\Delta t ~~~ (i = 0, ..., N-1)              & \\nonumber \\\\\nf_{j} = j\\Delta f ~~~ (j = 0, ..., N_{\\rm F}-1)      & \\nonumber \n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $N$ is the total time-bin number, \nof the order of $5\\times 10^{5}$ (300d / 54s), \n$N_{\\rm F} = N/2$ is the number of PSD bins, \n$\\Delta f$ is the width of each PSD bin [$\\Delta f = 1/(N\\Delta t)$], $R_{{\\rm cos},j}$ and $R_{{\\rm sin},j}$ \nare independent gaussian-distributed random numbers with their mean values 0 and their standard deviations $\\sqrt{Af_{i}^{-1}}$, \nwhile $c_i(f_j)$ and $s_i(f_j)$ are the corresponding Fourier components.\nThe DC component, $c_0$, is chosen so as to reproduce the average source count rate.\nThe factor $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N\\Delta t}}$ is the coefficient arising from the inverse Fourier transformation.\nThus, \\{$a_i;\\ i = 1,2,...N$\\} provides a simulated light curve, but without including the Poisson error.\n\n\nTo simulate the Poisson noise, \na Poisson distributed random number $b_i$ is generated at the $i$-th bin as\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n  b_i = p(a_{i}\\cdot(S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan}) + \\overline{B})~~~ \\rm{(counts)}.\n\\label{eq:C}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $p(x)$ means a Poisson distributed random number with the mean value of $x$, \n$S$ (cm$^2$) is the average effective area per scan, \n$a_{i}\\cdot(S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan})$ represents the simulated signal counts, \nand $\\overline{B}$ denotes the average background counts per transit of a source.\nWe ignore scan-by-scan scatter in $S$, $t_{\\rm scan}$, and $\\overline{B}$.\nFrom this $b_i$, we subtract $\\overline{B}$, and divide the result by $S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan}$, \nto obtain a simulated data point $Y_i$ as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 29594, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\overline{F} \\equiv \\frac{F_{\\rm b}+F_{\\rm f}}{2}$ is the average photon flux in the specified energy band\nand $\\Delta F \\equiv \\frac{F_{\\rm b}-F_{\\rm f}}{2}$ denotes the variable part.\nIn this formalism, the fractional RMS variation can be given as\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n \\eta' \\equiv  a\\Delta F/\\overline{F} = a (R-1)/(R+1)\n  \\label{eq:eta}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\eta^{\\prime}\\equiv a\\Delta F/\\overline{F}=a(R-1)/(R+1)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msup><mi>\u03b7</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>F</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02740.tex", "nexttext": "\nAn example of the light curve obtained in this way is shown in figure \\ref{fg:simlc}.\n\\\\\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{lc5400.eps}\n \\end{center}\n \\caption{The left figure is a simulated light curve calculated with equation (\\ref{eq:Yi}).\n The right one is after applying the data gaps and filling them by linear interpolations.\n The sampling time is $\\Delta t =$ 5400 s.}\n\\label{fg:simlc}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe simulate one hundred light curves composed of continuous 54-s bins, with a total real observation time of 318 d  \nwhich is the longest observation segment in the LHS (data No.1-all in table \\ref{tb:hardem}).\nThese 100 light curves with 54-s bin were Fourier transformed into PSDs, \nwhich were averaged to give the PSD shown in black in figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap}.\nIt recovers the assumed $\\propto f^{-1}$ shape.\n\n{\\bf A--2. Sampling effect}\n\nThe MAXI exposure for a celestial object is far from being continuous.\nA MAXI light curve consists of discrete snap-shot scans, \nwhich are separated by $\\Delta t = 92 {\\rm min}\\simeq 5400 {\\rm s}$ and lasting for $\\sim t_{\\rm scan}$ each.\nIn such sparse-sampling observations with $t_{\\rm scan} \\ll \\Delta t$, significant alias appears in the high frequency end (subsection 3.2.2; \\cite{Kirchner}).\n\n\nTo estimate the effects of aliasing (sampling effects), \nwe retained one every 100th bin, \nand discarded the remaining 99 data points.\nAnalysis of these sparse light curves yielded the red PSD in figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap}.\nThe red points have more power than the black one towards the Nyquist frequency.\nThis is because the power from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz, \nwhich was smeared out in the black PSD by averaging over the original 100 data points, \nnow appears in frequencies below $10^{-4}$ Hz.\nThis excess represents the alias power.\n\n\n\n\n{\\bf A--3. Gap effect}\n\nNext, to simulate the observational gaps, \nthe sparse (5400s bin) light curves were multiplied with exactly the same sampling windows as in the actual data (data No.1-all).\nAn example is given in figure \\ref{fg:simlc} (right).\nAfter interpolating these gaps in the same manner as for the actual data, \nthe fake light curves were again Fourier transformed.\nThe obtained PSDs were averaged, and are shown in figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap} in blue.\nThe alias effect is still present.\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=12cm]{hkk_long-54-54gap.eps}\n \\end{center}\n \\caption{Simulations of the alias effects and sampling effects on the PSD.\n The black data are the PSD calculated from 100 fake light curves, \n each continuous with a bin width of 54s.\n The red one is the PSD calculated after sparse sampling \n (once every 5400s), to the original light curves, and blue one further considering the data gaps that are present in the read data.\n The bottom panel shows the transfer-function, \n obtained by the dividing the blue PSD by the black one.}\n\\label{fg:alias+gap}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n{\\bf A--4. Correction by a Transfer function}\n\nThe bottom panel of figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap} shows the ratio of the PSD calculated from the sparse and gap-applied light curves, \nmimicking the actual observation, to the original PSD.\nThis is to be called the transfer function.\nWe corrected the sampling and gap effects in the MAXI/GSC observation, \nby dividing the PSD calculated from the real data by this transfer function.\n\n  \nTo evaluate systematic errors associated with the transfer function, \nwe also performed similar simulations by changing the PSD index to $-2$ and $-0.5$.\nAs expected, the transfer function became flatter ($\\sim 5$ at 10$^{-5}$) for the PSD index $-2$ ($\\sim 1$ at 10$^{-5}$ Hz), \nwhile more deviated from unity ($\\sim 5$ at $10^{-5}$ Hz) when the PSD index is set at $-0.5$.\nHowever, these effects are limited to frequencies above $\\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\chapter{Estimate of the Poisson noise}\n\\label{poisson}\n\nThe observed data are subject to statistical fluctuations, or Poisson noise.\nSince this component is independent of the intrinsic source variability,\nthe derived raw PSDs are considered to be a direct sum of\nthe intrinsic and Poissionian contributions.\nAlthough the Poisson noise would usually be a constant,\nthis is not true in the present case,\nbecause of the data gaps, background variations, and other practical effects.\nWe hence estimate the Poisson-noise contributions\nto the PSDs by a numerical simulation;\nthe results were already used in subtraction in section \\ref{sec:psd}\nwhen calculating the PSDs of figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} and figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}.\n\nThe aim of the above simulation is to construct light curves\nthat would be observed if Cyg X-1 had a constant intensity throughout.\nThis has been carried out in the following steps.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item[1]\nWe start from calculating the mean intensity $\\bar{y}$ of Cyg X-1\nin a specified energy band,\nas an average over the 5 years of the MAXI data.\n\n\\item[2]\nThe signal counts to be observed at the $i$-th scan\nof ``non-varying Cyg X-1\"\ncan be expressed as $\\bar{y} (S \\cdot  t_{\\rm scan})_i$,\nwhere the effective area $S$ and the source transit time $t_{\\rm scan}$\nare the same as in Appendix \\ref{gap}.\n\n\\item[3]\nThe total counts to be detected in the $i$-th scan can be expressed as\n$\\bar{y} (S \\cdot t_{\\rm scan})_i + \\alpha_i B_i$,\nwhere $B_i$ is the background which was estimated scan-by-scan\nand was already utilized in section \\ref{sec:obs} to derive the light curves in figure \\ref{fig:cygLC},\nwhile $\\alpha_i$ is a correction factor for the effective area in the $i$-th scan.\n\n\\item[4]\nThe above quantity is randomized into\n$b_i \\equiv p\\left( \\bar{y} (S \\cdot t_{\\rm scan} \\right)_i + \\alpha_i B_i)$\nin the same way as in Appendix \\ref{gap}.\nThen, $\\{b_i \\}$ represent the simulated raw counts data,\nbefore the background subtraction,\nto be detected in this fake observation.\n\n\\item[5]\nFrom this randomized counts $b_i$,\nwe subtract $\\alpha_i B_i$  in the same way as in section \\ref{sec:obs},\nand divide the result by $(S \\cdot t_{\\rm scan})_i$,\nto obtain the simulated light curve $\\{Y_i \\}$\nwhich should be observed from ``non-varying Cyg X-1\".\nThe procedure is summarized as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 67590, "prevtext": "\nwhere $a$ is an appropriate numerical factor of order unity,\nwhich can be approximated as energy independent.\nThis $a$ was introduced because the variation $\\eta$ of equation (\\ref{eq:rms}) calculated from NPSD can be different, by a constant factor, from that derived by equation (\\ref{eq:eta}).\nThe derived values of $\\eta'$ are also shown in table \\ref{tb:specrms},\nwere $a=2.9$ has been adopted. \nThus, the values of $\\eta'$ agree, within errors,\nwith $\\eta$ in table \\ref{tb:rms} which is based on the PSD  analysis.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=16cm]{hkkphav2.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{Ratios of the GSC spectra in the bright period to that in the faint period,\n  in the LHS (left panel), and in the HSS (right panel).\n  }\n\\label{fig:pha}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nTo understand the physical origin of the behavior seen in figure \\ref{fig:pha},\nas well as in table \\ref{tb:rms} and table \\ref{tb:specrms}, we proceeded to simultaneous model fitting to the 2--20 keV GSC spectrum\nand the 0.7--7 keV SSC spectrum.\nThe 1.5--2 keV range of the SSC was excluded\nto avoid the known systematic uncertainty in the effective area (\\cite{tomida}).\nFirst, we employed a model composed of a multi-color disk ({\\em diskbb}) model (\\cite{shakura, mitsuda}) for the low-energy part,\nand a power-law ({\\em powerlaw}) as a hard tail.\nThis model has often been used in the previous studies of BH X-ray binaries including Cyg X-1 (e.g. \\cite{dotani}).\nThe photo-electric absorption model ({\\em phabs}) with abundances by \\citet{anders}\nand the Fe-K emission line model ({\\em gaussian}) were incorporated.\nThe model then becomes {\\em phabs$\\times$(diskbb+powerlaw+gaussian)} in the Xspec (\\cite{arnaud96}) terminology; \nhereafter, we call it {\\em diskbb+powerlaw} model.\nThe innermost radius of {\\em diskbb} is derived as $r_{\\rm{in}} = D\\sqrt{N_{\\rm{diskbb}}/\\cos{i}}$,\nwhere $N_{\\rm{diskbb}}$ is the normalization of the {\\em diskbb} model.\nThe distance $D$ from the earth and the inclination angle $i$ from our line of sight\nwere adopted to be 1.86 kpc and 27$^{\\circ}$, respectively \\citep{orosz}.\nThe hydrogen column density $N_{\\rm H}$ and the gaussian parameters\nwere constrained to be common between the faint and the bright spectra  in each state,\nbut were allowed to differ between the two states.\n\n\nThe fit has been approximately successful,\nand yielded the best-fit parameters as summarized in table \\ref{tb:especpow}.\nThus, in both states, the  {\\em diskbb} parameters are the same, within errors,\nbetween the bright and faint spectra.\nIn the LHS, the {\\em powerlaw} index is steeper in the bright spectrum than in the faint one,\nwhile the opposite trend is found in  the HSS.\nThese are consistent with the spectral ratio shown in figure \\ref{fig:pha}.\nThe $r_{\\rm in}$ value for the LHS is consistent with that from a previous work \\citep{yamada}.\nOn the other hand,  that for the HSS is smaller than that reported, e.g., in \\citet{dotani} (even after corrections for the distance and the mass),\npresumably because the luminosity in the present result\nis roughly half  those in typical HSS observations made previously \\citep{zhang}.\n\nReferring to equation (\\ref{eq:eta}), we calculated $\\eta'$ also for the {\\em powerlaw} component only, and show the results in table \\ref{tb:specrms}. \nA comparison of the two values of $\\eta'$, one from the entire photon counts while the other from the {\\em powerlaw} contribution, \nreveals that the overall source variability in $> 4$ keV is determined solely by the power law variation, \nin agreement with the spectral decomposition in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp} (right).\nIn the 2--4 keV band, in contrast, the overall  $\\eta'$ is reduced to $\\sim 60\\%$  of the {\\em powerlaw} variability; \nthis effect is readily attributed to the presence of the stable disk component.\nIn addition, table \\ref{tb:specrms} reveals slight increase of  $\\eta'$ (both total and {\\em powerlaw}) from the 10-\u00e2\u0080\u009320 keV to 4--10 keV bands.\nThe behavior of $\\eta'$ agrees with that of $\\eta$ in table \\ref{tb:rms} and means that the {\\em powerlaw} slope slightly hardens as it gets stronger, \nas visualized in figure \\ref{fig:pha} (right) and quantified in the fitting results in table \\ref{tb:especpow}.\nThis finding is not necessarily consistent, however,  with previous reports on Cyg X-1 in the HSS (e.g., \\cite{jourdain}) and other HSS sources (e.g., \\cite{koyama}),\nthat the hard-tail slope is relatively independent of the source intensity.\nIt is possible that the present HSS was somewhat atypical, \nbecause the values of $\\Gamma \\sim 2.9$ we measured is steeper than those ( $\\Gamma \\sim 2.4$; \\cite{dotani}) observed from these BHBs in their typical HSS.\n\n\n\nFor a further analysis, we replaced the {\\em powerlaw} with a more realistic model {\\em nthComp} (\\cite{zdziarski}), which represents Compton \nscattering of some soft photons by hot electrons ({\\em diskbb+nthComp} model).\nThe seed photon source was set to be the {\\em diskbb} component representing the disk emission.\nSince the electron temperature $T_{\\rm e}$ of the {\\em nthComp} model cannot be determined with our data, we fixed it to a \ntypical value of 100 keV \\citet{Sunyaev79, makishima}. \nThe best-fit parameters are summarized in table \\ref{tb:especcomp} and the best-fit models are shown in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp}.\nThe fits are not yet formally acceptable, but the model, as shown in figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp}, reasonably reproduces the spectra from 0.7 keV to 20 keV. \t\t\nIn this modeling, the disk photons are partially fed into {\\em nthComp}, \nso that the parameter $r_{\\rm in}$ in the {\\em diskbb} model is smaller than the true inner radius which is denoted $R_{\\rm in}$ hereafter. \nThis $R_{\\rm in}$ was calculated from the sum of 0.01--100 keV photon flux of the {\\em diskbb} component, $F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{disk}}$, \nand that of nthComp component, $F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{nth}}$, utilizing the innermost temperature $T_{\\rm in}$ of {\\em diskbb} and the equation by \\citet{kubota} as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\lefteqn{F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{disk}}+F_{\\rm{ph}}^{\\rm{nth}}} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\lefteqn{= 0.0165\\Biggl[\\frac{R_{\\rm{in}}^2\\cos{i}}{(D/10\\ \\rm{kpc})^2}\\Biggr]\\Biggl(\\frac{T_{\\rm{in}}}{1\\ \\rm{keV}}\\Biggr)^3\\ \\ \\rm{ph}\\ \\rm{s}^{-1}\\ \\rm{cm}^{-2}.} \\label{eq:r}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe derived values of $R_{\\rm in}$, shown in table \\ref{tb:especcomp}, are indeed larger than $r_{\\rm in}$ in table \\ref{tb:especpow} \n(although we do not discuss absolute values of $R_{\\rm in}$).\nThe LHS is characterized by about twice larger $R_{\\rm in}$ than the HSS, \nimplying a disk truncation in the LHS as noted before \\citep{makishima, yamada}.\nFinally, in either state, the disk parameters ($T_{\\rm in}$ and $R_{\\rm in}$) are found to be apparently constant as the source varies.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\small\n\\caption{The flux ratio $R$ of equation (\\ref{eq:ratio}), and the RMS variation $\\eta'$ of equation

obtained with MAXI, we derived the NPSDs of Cyg X-1 in its LHS and HSS from $10^{-7}$ Hz to 10$^{-4}$ Hz in the three energy bands.\nIt is of particular importance that the long-term variations in the two states were studied in a unified way \nusing the same instrument, with the same analysis method, \nand under similar data statistics.\nIn addition, the long-term NPSD in the HSS was obtained for the first time thanks to a fortunate opportunity that Cyg X-1 stayed in the HSS in most of the time since 2010 June.\nThese results on the HSS are expected to provide some clues to the still unknown origin of the hard-tail component, \nwhich is nearly always observed in this spectral state.\n\n\nIn the LHS, the NPSD down to $10^{-7}$ Hz obeys a power-law, and  is approximately expressed as an extrapolation of the NPSD above 0.01 Hz \\citep{pot, nowak}.\nWe found that the NPSD in the low (2--4 keV) energy band is slightly larger than those in the 4--10 and 10--20 keV bands \n(figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} left, figure \\ref{fig:avepsd} left, and table \\ref{tb:rms}).\n\n\nThe newly obtained $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ Hz NPSD in the HSS is also approximated by a power-law, \nand on an extrapolation of the NPSD previously obtained in frequencies above 10$^{-4}$ Hz \\citep{chura, cui1997}.\nThe NPSD (RMS$^2$/mean$^2$ Hz$^{-1}$) in the HSS is about one order of magnitude larger than that in the LHS in 10--20 keV.  \nThis differs from the case of other BH binaries reported by \\citet{miyamoto1993}, although their data were limited to higher frequency range above 0.01 Hz.\nIn the HSS, the NPSD from $10^{-7}$ Hz to 10$^{-4}$ Hz has an energy dependence in such a way that it is 5$\\sim$6 times higher in the 10--20 keV band than that in the low energy band (2--4 keV).  \nThis finding extends the results of energy dependence in 0.2--200 Hz reported by \\citet{grinberg}. \nThese energy dependences of the long-term variation in the HSS were reconfirmed via the spectral analysis in section \\ref{energy}.\n\n\n\nIn the present paper,  \nwe used only the MAXI data \nbecause the energy band is suitable for simultaneous analyzing the variations of the disk component and the power-law component.\nIn order to further study the hard tail variability, \nthe Swift/BAT data with good statistic above 20 keV should be utilized: \nwe consider that this is our future task.\n\n\n\\subsection{Comparison with short-term variability}\nSince the first discovery by \\citet{oda}, the aperiodic fast X-ray variation of Cyg X-1 has been\ninvestigated by a number of authors (e.g., \\cite{negoro1994}, \\cite{chura}),\nmainly in the LHS and typically over $10^{-3}-10^2$ Hz frequency range.\nSimilar studies have been performed on other BHBs as well, including in particular GX 339-4 (\\cite{maejima}; \\cite{miyamoto1994}).\nGiven these, let us briefly compare the present studies with the previous results on the short-term variability of Cyg X-1.\n\nOur results on the LHS has two similarities to the short-term variability in the same state.\nOne is the PSD slope, which is $\\sim 1.4$ over $10^{-7}-10^{-2}$ Hz and $\\sim 1$ in the $>10^{-1}$ Hz range (figure \\ref{fig:hkkchura}).\nThe other is the energy dependence; on both time scales, $\\eta$ decreases slowly towards higher energies, \nimplying ``softer when brighter\" characteristic, \nwhich Cyg X-1 shows when it is above $\\sim 1\\%$ of the Eddington luminosity.\nFor example, \\citet{grinberg} reported that the 0.125--256 Hz variation of Cyg X-1 in the LHS is about twice higher in 2.1--4.5 keV than in 5.7--9.4 keV,\nin approximate agreement with our table \\ref{tb:rms}.\nAlso, the Suzaku result obtained in the LHS,\nnamely, figure 8b of \\citet{makishima},\nreveals a similar energy dependence.\nThese two resemblances altogether suggest a common mechanism working on these very wide range of time scales.\nFor example, the higher short-term variability in softer energy bands may be a result of spectral softening as individual ``shots\" develop \n\\citep{negoro1994, yamadashot}.\nHowever, the phenomenon cannot be completely self-similar, since the PSD shows a considerable flattening over the $10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ range.\n\nThe fast variability in the HSS has been considerably less studied than that in the LHS.\nNevertheless, \nwe can point out again two similarities between the long-term vs. short-term variations.\nOne is that our NPSD index in the HSS ($\\sim 1.3$) is similar to the short-term HSS index of $\\sim 1$ by \\citet{cui1997}, \nas clearly seen figure \\ref{fig:hkkchura}.\nThe other is the energy dependence; the slight increase of variability from the 4--10 keV to 10--20 keV ranges \n(subsection \\ref{psdresult2} and section \\ref{energy}) \nis also observed in short-term results by \\citet{grinberg}.\t\nAs already described, this ``harder when brighter\" property is opposite to the behavior, ``softer when brighter\", in the LHS.\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral variation}\n\nThe energy spectrum in the LHS is known to be approximated by a power-law with a high-energy cutoff around 100 keV (e.g., \\cite{makishima}).  \nThis is interpreted by a scenario that an optically-thick standard disk \\citep{shakura} is truncated at some distance \nfrom the BH and an optically-thin accretion flow (or a corona) is formed around the BH \\citep{esin}.  \nHigh temperature electrons, in the optically-thin corona, up-scatter seed photons presumably from the outer standard disk.\nIn this frame work, the fast hard X-ray variability in the LHS may be explained by considering \nthat the corona covers a variable fraction of the disk \\citep{makishima}; \nwhen this fraction increases, \nthe source gets brighter, \nand softer due to the enhanced Compton cooling of the corona.\nIn fact, the MAXI spectrum accumulated over the LHS (figure \\ref{fig:cygespeccomp} left) was described successfully with the two component model, \nconsisting of a low-temperature {\\em diskbb} \\citep{mitsuda} representing the emission from such a truncated standard disk, \nand the {\\em powerlaw}  or the {\\em nthComp} representing the Compton up-scattered component.\n\nLike in many other reports on BHBs in the HSS, the MAXI spectrum in the HSS has been expressed by a dominant optically-thick thermal spectrum, \naccompanied by a {\\em powerlaw} component extending into higher energies.\nThe former is again interpreted by an emission from a standard-disk \\citep{shakura}, which is now considered to extend down to \nthe innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) around the BH.  \nThis is supported by the fact that the obtained inner disk radii in the HSS do not differ significantly between the faint and bright periods.\nLike the overall hard X-ray emission in the LHS, \nthe hard {\\em powerlaw} component in the HSS could also be a Compton up-scatters component produced by some hot electrons \n\\citep{cui1998, gierlinski}, but details are still unclear.\n\n\nIn order to better understand the NPSD results, we fitted the spectra by a model composed of a {\\em diskbb}, and the {\\em powerlaw} or the {\\em nthComp}, \nand studied how the spectrum changes as the source varies on frequencies range below $8\\times 10^{-7}$ Hz.\nThe obtained results, fully consistent with those from the NPSD studies, can be summarized into the following four points.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item[1] In  both states, the {\\em powerlaw} component is responsible for the observed long-term intensity variations, while the disk emission is essentially constant.\n\n\\item[2] The power-law component in the HSS is concluded to be more variable, on this frequency range, than that in the LHS.\n\n\\item[3] The decreasing variability towards higher energies, observed in the LHS, can be attributed mostly to the ``softer when brighter\" property of the {\\em powerlaw} component.\n\n\\item[4] The variability increase with energies in the HSS results from a combination of the two effects,\nnamely, the ``harder when brighter\" property of the {\\em powerlaw} component in this state, and the presence of the stable disk emission at lower energies.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\nSimilarly high long-term variations were observed also from some BH transients, \nincluding GS 1124$-$684 and GS 2000+25 \\citep{tanaka, terada}.\nWhen their outburst decline was followed by sparse snap-shot observation with Ginga, the intensity of the disk component changed smoothly, \nbut the power-law component varied largely from one observation to the next.\nThus, high long-term variability of the hard component in the HSS may be common to all BH binaries, \nincluding persistent and transient sources.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Origin of the time variation}\n\nLet us discuss the origin of the long-term variations which we detected down to $10^{-7}$ Hz.\nThe simplest possibility would be that  fluctuations in\nthe overall mass transfer rate from the companion star\nproduce the observed long-term X-ray variations.\nGenerally, the mass transfer in Cyg X-1 is thought to\noccur via capture of the stellar winds from the super giant companion star, HDE226868.\nThe winds are considered inhomogeneous as reported by several authors \\citep{Conti89,GiesBolton86,Hanke09},\nand as evidenced by variable X-ray absorption episodes\naround the superior conjunctions of the BH \\citep{kitamoto, remillard1984, church1997}.\nTherefore, the mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}$ must fluctuate,\nand could produce the long-term variability.\nHowever, besides the issue of how these fluctuations can propagate\nto the X-ray emission regions (see below),\nit is not trivial to explain with this scenario\nthe difference in the variation ($\\eta$ and $\\eta'$)\nobserved between the LHS and HSS.\n\n\n\n\nThe observed long-term X-ray variations may alternatively arise\nwhen some  fluctuations in $\\dot{M}$,\nproduced spontaneously in the accretion flow at various radii,\npropagate to the BH vicinity.\nAt a radius $r$ from the BH,\nsuch spontaneous fluctuations\nmay generally take place\non a time scale comparable to the thermal time scale\n$t_{\\rm th}=(\\alpha \\Omega_{\\rm K})^{-1}$,\nor the dynamical time scale $t_{\\rm d} = (\\Omega_{\\rm K})^{-1}$,\nwhere $\\Omega_{\\rm K}$ is the Keplerian angular velocity at $r$\nand $\\alpha$ is the viscosity parameter.\nSuch variations can propagate toward the center\nonly if their time scales are longer than the viscous time scale,\ngiven as $t_{\\rm v}=(\\alpha \\Omega_{\\rm K})^{-1}(r/H)^{2}$,\nwhere $H$ is the disk half thickness.\nIn an optically thick and geometrically thin  disk,\nthis $t_{\\rm v}$ is much longer than $t_{\\rm th}$ and $t_{\\rm d}$ because $H \\ll r$.\nTherefore, variations in $\\dot{M}$ produced at any outer radii,\n being strongly dissipated, would not propagate down to the X-ray emitting region.\nHowever, if some fraction of $\\dot{M}$ streams through\na geometrically-thick ($H\\sim r$) and optically-thin flow,\nin which  we expect $t_{\\rm v} \\sim t_{\\rm th}$,\nthe fluctuations produced at various larger radii can propagate inwards,\nand cause the X-ray intensity to vary on a wide range of time scales.\nThis idea was invoked by \\citet{chura} to explain\nthe X-ray variations on  timescales down to $10^{-4}$ Hz.\nWe may extend this two-flow scenario from the time scale of $10^{-4}$ Hz to $10^{-7}$ Hz,\nidentifying the optically-thick part with the standard accretion disk,\nand assuming that the optically-thin part\ndevelops into the Comptonizing corona in a vicinity of the BH.\nAssuming a $15~M_{\\odot}$ BH and $\\alpha = 0.01$,\nthe observed time scale of $t_{\\rm th} \\sim 10^{7}$ s\ncan be explained if the optically-thin flow starts\nat $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{12}$ cm ($\\sim 6 \\times 10^{5} R_{\\rm s}$).\nFurthermore, as detailed in Appendix \\ref{mdot},\nthe larger long-term variability in the HSS can be explained\nif  the fraction of $\\dot{M}$ through the optically-thin part\ncarries $\\sim 0.5~\\dot{M}$ in the HSS,\nwhile $\\sim 0.2~\\dot{M}$ in the LHS.\n\n\nAlthough the two-flow picture, as constructed above after \\citet{chura},\ncan account for essential features of the observed long-term variability of Cyg X-1,\nit is still subject to a few issues to be solved.\nOne is that the required size of the optically-thin flow is comparable\nto the binary size of Cyg X-1 (0.2 AU).\nIt is not obvious whether such a large-scale optically-thin flow\ncan be actually created by possible candidate mechanisms,\nsuch as X-ray irradiation, vertical magnetic pressure,\nand initial scatter in the specific angular momentum of accepting blobs.\nEven if such a flow is produced,\nit is not obvious whether its low density can be compensated by its higher radial velocity,\nto  carry a considerable fraction of the total $\\dot{M}$.\nFurthermore, we need to assume that the state difference,\nwhich is usually thought to be triggered at close vicinities of the BH,\nis already present at such large radii:\nit is not clear, either,\nwhether some feedback mechanisms (e.g., X-ray irradiation)\ncan control large-scale accretion flows in the required manner.\n\nAt present, we cannot conclude for sure \nwhether the observed slow variations in the HSS can be explained by either the stellar wind fluctuation or the two-flow picture.\nWe might need to consider other origins of the slow variability,\nincluding their production at regions much closer to the BH.\nFurther discussion is beyond the scope of the present paper:\nalthough our ultimate goal is to identify the origin of the long-term variation, \nthe currently available data information is still insufficient for that purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nBy  analyzing the three-band (2--4, 4--10 and 10--20 keV) MAXI data accumulated over 5 years,\nwe studied characteristics of the long term X-ray variation of Cyg X-1\nover the frequency range of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ Hz.\nThe long-term NPSD in the HSS was obtained for the first time.\nBy treating the LHS and the HSS data separately \nbut in the same manner, \nthe following results have been obtained.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \nIn the LHS and HSS, the index of the NPSD was obtained as $-1.35\\pm 0.29$ and $-1.29\\pm 0.23$, respectively.\nThey are consistent with those previously measured in the frequency range above 10$^{-3}$ Hz.\n\n\\item \nIn the 4--10 keV, and 10--20 keV bands, the fractional RMS variation $\\eta$ observed in the HSS was\n$\\sim 2$ and $\\sim 3$ times higher, respectively, than those measured in the LHS in the corresponding energies.\nIn the 2--4 keV band, $\\eta$ in the HSS was comparable to that in the LHS.\n\n\\item \nIn the LHS, $\\eta$ weakly decreased towards higher energies.\nThis property is consistent with that seen in the short-term variability during the LHS.\n\n\\item \nIn the HSS, $\\eta$ was found to increase significantly with energy,\nas a combination of  the following two effects.\nOne is that the disk component is stable while the hard tail varies.\nThe other is that the hard tail slope flattens as it becomes brighter.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nWe have studied long-term variability of the hard tail component in the HSS.\nThis will provide important clues to the yet unidentified origin of this emission component.\n\n\n\n\nThis work was supported by RIKEN Junior Research Associate Program.\nThis work was  also partially supported by \nthe Ministry of Education,

How to simulate a MAXI/GSC light curve}\n\nTo estimate effects of the data gaps and the sampling windows in our Cyg X-1 observation with the MAXI/GSC,  \nwe make a simulated light curve in units of (counts s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$), \nwhose PSD has a form of $Af^{-1}$.\nThe normalization $A$ is chosen to be close to what has actually been observed with the MAXI/GSC.\nLet us assume first that the observation is continuous with each data bin having a length $\\Delta t$, \nand set it equal to a typical source transit time, $t_{\\rm scan} = 54$ s.\nAccording to the method described in \\citet{Isobe} and \\citet{Timmer}, the count rate $a_i$ at the $i$-th bin is generated as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\na_{i} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N\\Delta t}}\\sum^{N_{F}-1}_{j=0}\\{c_{i}(f_{j}) + s_{i}(f_{j})\\} & \\rm{(counts~~s^{-1}~~cm^{-2})} \\nonumber \\\\\n                                                       & \\label{eq:A} \\\\\nc_{i}(f_{j}) = R_{{\\rm cos},j}\\cos(2\\pi f_{j}t_{i})   & \\nonumber \\\\\ns_{i}(f_{j}) = R_{{\\rm sin},j}\\sin(2\\pi f_{j}t_{i})   & \\nonumber \\\\\nt_{i} = i\\Delta t ~~~ (i = 0, ..., N-1)              & \\nonumber \\\\\nf_{j} = j\\Delta f ~~~ (j = 0, ..., N_{\\rm F}-1)      & \\nonumber \n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $N$ is the total time-bin number, \nof the order of $5\\times 10^{5}$ (300d / 54s), \n$N_{\\rm F} = N/2$ is the number of PSD bins, \n$\\Delta f$ is the width of each PSD bin [$\\Delta f = 1/(N\\Delta t)$], $R_{{\\rm cos},j}$ and $R_{{\\rm sin},j}$ \nare independent gaussian-distributed random numbers with their mean values 0 and their standard deviations $\\sqrt{Af_{i}^{-1}}$, \nwhile $c_i(f_j)$ and $s_i(f_j)$ are the corresponding Fourier components.\nThe DC component, $c_0$, is chosen so as to reproduce the average source count rate.\nThe factor $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{N\\Delta t}}$ is the coefficient arising from the inverse Fourier transformation.\nThus, \\{$a_i;\\ i = 1,2,...N$\\} provides a simulated light curve, but without including the Poisson error.\n\n\nTo simulate the Poisson noise, \na Poisson distributed random number $b_i$ is generated at the $i$-th bin as\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n  b_i = p(a_{i}\\cdot(S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan}) + \\overline{B})~~~ \\rm{(counts)}.\n\\label{eq:C}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $p(x)$ means a Poisson distributed random number with the mean value of $x$, \n$S$ (cm$^2$) is the average effective area per scan, \n$a_{i}\\cdot(S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan})$ represents the simulated signal counts, \nand $\\overline{B}$ denotes the average background counts per transit of a source.\nWe ignore scan-by-scan scatter in $S$, $t_{\\rm scan}$, and $\\overline{B}$.\nFrom this $b_i$, we subtract $\\overline{B}$, and divide the result by $S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan}$, \nto obtain a simulated data point $Y_i$ as\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation} \n Y_i = (b_i - \\overline{B})/(S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan})~~~ \\rm{(counts~~s^{-1}~~cm^{-2})}.\n

corona}\n\\label{mdot}\n\nUtilizing schematic drawings in figure \\ref{fig:cartoon}, \nwe consider an accretion model of Cyg X-1 that can explain our results.\nThe optically-thick accretion disk (thick black line) is assumed to extend from outer regions inwards, but is truncated at a certain radius in the LHS.\nMeanwhile, in the HSS it is thought to extend down to the ISCO.\nIn both states, the optically-thin flow is assumed to extend from an outer region ($\\sim 6 \\times 10^{5} R_{\\rm s}$) to the ISCO.\nThe radii, observed low frequency variations of the mass flow are assumed to be \ngenerated in the optically-thin flow at large radii, \nand propagates through the optically-thin flow to the vicinity of the BH to make the hot corona vary on these long time scales.\n\nAfter \\citet{chura}, let us consider mass accretion rate through the optically-thick disk; $\\dot{M}_{d}$ \nand through the optically-thin flow; $\\dot{M}_{c}$.\nThe total accretion rate is given as $\\dot{M}_t = \\dot{M}_d + \\dot{M}_c$.\nWe further assume that \nthe Comptonized component in the energy spectrum is mainly powered by $\\dot{M}_{c}$, \nwhile the disk emission by $\\dot{M}_{d}$.\nLet us describe fractional variations in $\\dot{M}_{c}$ and $\\dot{M}_{d}$ as $f_c$ and $f_d$, respectively, \nand assume that these quantities depend neither  on the frequency nor on the spectral state.\nThen, the observed normalized power should be proportional to $[(f_{c}\\dot{M}_{c})^2+(f_{d}\\dot{M}_{d})^2]/(\\dot{M}_{t})^2$.\nWhen the optically-thick flow is not variable, $f_{d}$ is equaled to zero.\n\nIn the LHS, the optically-thick accretion disk is truncated at a certain radius, \nand within that radius, only the optically-thin flow exists ($\\dot{M}_{t} = \\dot{M}_{c}$; \\cite{chura}). \nThen, since the time variation above 0.1~Hz originates only from the optically-thin flow,  \nthe normalized power of this range is $f_{c}^2$ itself; NPSD $= f_{c}^2$.\nOn the other hand, in the frequency less than 10$^{-3}$~Hz the NPSD is roughly $\\frac{1}{25}$  of the extrapolation of the NPSD above 0.1~Hz.\nTherefore $\\bigl[\\frac{(f_{c}\\dot{M}_{c})^2}{(\\dot{M}_{t})^2}\\bigr]_{\\rm LHS} = \\frac{1}{25} f_{c}^{2}$, \nwhere $f_{d}=0$ is assumed.\nThe suffix LHS specifies the states.\nSince we assume that $f_{c}$ is independent of frequency, \nwe obtain  $\\bigl[\\frac{\\dot{M}_{c}}{\\dot{M}_{t}}\\bigr]_{\\rm LHS} \\sim\\frac{1}{5}$, \nand hence $\\bigl[\\frac{\\dot{M}_{d}}{\\dot{M}_{t}}\\bigr]_{\\rm LHS} \\sim\\frac{4}{5}$.\nIn the hypothetical model, \nthe PSD flattening at $10^{-3} - 10^{-1}$ Hz (figure \\ref{fig:hkkchura}) is explained that \nthe higher-frequency variations ($> 10^{-1}$ Hz) are produced inside the disk-truncation radius, \nwhile the lower-frequency ones ($< 10^{-3}$ Hz) mainly originate in the region where the two flows co-exist.\n\nSimilar arguments can be performed on the HSS.\nIn the low frequency region below $10^{-4}$~Hz, the normalized power of the HSS, \n$\\bigl[ \\frac{(f_{c}\\dot{M}_{c})^2}{(\\dot{M}_{t})^2} \\bigr]_{\\rm HSS}$, \nis about six times larger than \nthat in the LHS, \n$\\bigl[ \\frac{(f_{c}\\dot{M}_{c})^2}{(\\dot{M}_{t})^2} \\bigr]_{\\rm LHS} = \\frac{1}{25} f_{c}^{2}$ (see figure \\ref{fig:hkkchura}).\nSince we assume that $f_{c}$ does not depend on the states, \n$\\bigl[\\frac{(f_{c}\\dot{M}_{c})^2}{(\\dot{M}_{t})^2}\\bigr]_{\\rm HSS} = \\frac{6}{25} f_{c}^{2}$. \nThen, $\\bigl[\\frac{\\dot{M}_{c}}{\\dot{M}_{t}}\\bigr]_{\\rm HSS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{25}} \\sim \\frac{1}{2}$, \nand hence $\\bigl[\\frac{\\dot{M}_{d}}{\\dot{M}_{t}}\\bigr]_{\\rm HSS} \\sim\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThese values are supported by the fact that  \nthe luminosity of the disk component is roughly the same as that of the Comptonized component in the HSS (see table \\ref{tb:especcomp}).\nThe inferred fractions of the mass accretion rate through the assumed two flows are summarized in figure \\ref{fig:cartoon}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[bhtp]\n  \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=18cm]{CygX1_accmodel_hs.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{Ilustrations of

in the LHS (data No.1-all in table \\ref{tb:hardem}).\nThese 100 light curves with 54-s bin were Fourier transformed into PSDs, \nwhich were averaged to give the PSD shown in black in figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap}.\nIt recovers the assumed $\\propto f^{-1}$ shape.\n\n{\\bf A--2. Sampling effect}\n\nThe MAXI exposure for a celestial object is far from being continuous.\nA MAXI light curve consists of discrete snap-shot scans, \nwhich are separated by $\\Delta t = 92 {\\rm min}\\simeq 5400 {\\rm s}$ and lasting for $\\sim t_{\\rm scan}$ each.\nIn such sparse-sampling observations with $t_{\\rm scan} \\ll \\Delta t$, significant alias appears in the high frequency end (subsection 3.2.2; \\cite{Kirchner}).\n\n\nTo estimate the effects of aliasing (sampling effects), \nwe retained one every 100th bin, \nand discarded the remaining 99 data points.\nAnalysis of these sparse light curves yielded the red PSD in figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap}.\nThe red points have more power than the black one towards the Nyquist frequency.\nThis is because the power from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz, \nwhich was smeared out in the black PSD by averaging over the original 100 data points, \nnow appears in frequencies below $10^{-4}$ Hz.\nThis excess represents the alias power.\n\n\n\n\n{\\bf A--3. Gap effect}\n\nNext, to simulate the observational gaps, \nthe sparse (5400s bin) light curves were multiplied with exactly the same sampling windows as in the actual data (data No.1-all).\nAn example is given in figure \\ref{fg:simlc} (right).\nAfter interpolating these gaps in the same manner as for the actual data, \nthe fake light curves were again Fourier transformed.\nThe obtained PSDs were averaged, and are shown in figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap} in blue.\nThe alias effect is still present.\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=12cm]{hkk_long-54-54gap.eps}\n \\end{center}\n \\caption{Simulations of the alias effects and sampling effects on the PSD.\n The black data are the PSD calculated from 100 fake light curves, \n each continuous with a bin width of 54s.\n The red one is the PSD calculated after sparse sampling \n (once every 5400s), to the original light curves, and blue one further considering the data gaps that are present in the read data.\n The bottom panel shows the transfer-function, \n obtained by the dividing the blue PSD by the black one.}\n\\label{fg:alias+gap}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n{\\bf A--4. Correction by a Transfer function}\n\nThe bottom panel of figure \\ref{fg:alias+gap} shows the ratio of the PSD calculated from the sparse and gap-applied light curves, \nmimicking the actual observation, to the original PSD.\nThis is to be called the transfer function.\nWe corrected the sampling and gap effects in the MAXI/GSC observation, \nby dividing the PSD calculated from the real data by this transfer function.\n\n  \nTo evaluate systematic errors associated with the transfer function, \nwe also performed similar simulations by changing the PSD index to $-2$ and $-0.5$.\nAs expected, the transfer function became flatter ($\\sim 5$ at 10$^{-5}$) for the PSD index $-2$ ($\\sim 1$ at 10$^{-5}$ Hz), \nwhile more deviated from unity ($\\sim 5$ at $10^{-5}$ Hz) when the PSD index is set at $-0.5$.\nHowever, these effects are limited to frequencies above $\\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\chapter{Estimate of the Poisson noise}\n\\label{poisson}\n\nThe observed data are subject to statistical fluctuations, or Poisson noise.\nSince this component is independent of the intrinsic source variability,\nthe derived raw PSDs are considered to be a direct sum of\nthe intrinsic and Poissionian contributions.\nAlthough the Poisson noise would usually be a constant,\nthis is not true in the present case,\nbecause of the data gaps, background variations, and other practical effects.\nWe hence estimate the Poisson-noise contributions\nto the PSDs by a numerical simulation;\nthe results were already used in subtraction in section \\ref{sec:psd}\nwhen calculating the PSDs of figure \\ref{fig:cygnpsd} and figure \\ref{fig:avepsd}.\n\nThe aim of the above simulation is to construct light curves\nthat would be observed if Cyg X-1 had a constant intensity throughout.\nThis has been carried out in the following steps.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item[1]\nWe start from calculating the mean intensity $\\bar{y}$ of Cyg X-1\nin a specified energy band,\nas an average over the 5 years of the MAXI data.\n\n\\item[2]\nThe signal counts to be observed at the $i$-th scan\nof ``non-varying Cyg X-1\"\ncan be expressed as $\\bar{y} (S \\cdot  t_{\\rm scan})_i$,\nwhere the effective area $S$ and the source transit time $t_{\\rm scan}$\nare the same as in Appendix \\ref{gap}.\n\n\\item[3]\nThe total counts to be detected in the $i$-th scan can be expressed as\n$\\bar{y} (S \\cdot t_{\\rm scan})_i + \\alpha_i B_i$,\nwhere $B_i$ is the background which was estimated scan-by-scan\nand was already utilized in section \\ref{sec:obs} to derive the light curves in figure \\ref{fig:cygLC},\nwhile $\\alpha_i$ is a correction factor for the effective area in the $i$-th scan.\n\n\\item[4]\nThe above quantity is randomized into\n$b_i \\equiv p\\left( \\bar{y} (S \\cdot t_{\\rm scan} \\right)_i + \\alpha_i B_i)$\nin the same way as in Appendix \\ref{gap}.\nThen, $\\{b_i \\}$ represent the simulated raw counts data,\nbefore the background subtraction,\nto be detected in this fake observation.\n\n\\item[5]\nFrom this randomized counts $b_i$,\nwe subtract $\\alpha_i B_i$  in the same way as in section \\ref{sec:obs},\nand divide the result by $(S \\cdot t_{\\rm scan})_i$,\nto obtain the simulated light curve $\\{Y_i \\}$\nwhich should be observed from ``non-varying Cyg X-1\".\nThe procedure is summarized as\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n       Y_i = \\left( b_i - \\alpha_i B_i \\right)/ \\left( S \\cdot t_{\\rm scan} \\right)_i\n       ~~~ (\\rm{counts~s}^{-1}~\\rm{cm}^{-2})~.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Y_{i}=\\left(b_{i}-\\alpha_{i}B_{i}\\right)/\\left(S\\cdot t_{\\rm scan}\\right)_{i}~%&#10;{}~{}~{}(\\rm{counts~{}s}^{-1}~{}\\rm{cm}^{-2})~{}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>Y</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>/</mo><mpadded width=\"+9.9pt\"><msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>scan</mi></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>i</mi></msub></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>counts</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>cm</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
