It is well known that $R$ is coherent if and only if $(0:r)$ and $A\\cap B$ are finitely generated for each $r\\in R$ and any two finitely generated ideals $A$ and $B$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{T:cohmax}\nLet $R$ be a  coherent ring. If $P$ is a maximal ideal such that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$ then $P$ is finitely generated too.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nFirst, suppose there exists an integer $n>0$ such that $P^n=0$. So, $R$ is local of maximal ideal $P$. We can choose $n$ minimal. If $n=1$ then $P$ is clearly finitely generated. Suppose $n>1$. It follows that $P^{n-1}\\ne 0$. So, $P=(0:r)$ for each $0\\ne r\\in P^{n-1}$. Since $R$ is coherent, $P$ is finitely generated. Now, suppose that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n\\geq 1$. If $R'=R/P^n$ and $P'=P/P^n$ then $R'$ is coherent and $P'^n=0$. From above we  deduce that $P'$ is finitely generated. Hence $P$ is finitely generated too.\n\\end{proof} \n\nThe following theorem can be proven by using \\cite[Lemma 1.8]{GiHeRo99}.\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{T:main} Let $R$ be a ring. Suppose that $R_P$ is coherent for each maximal ideal $P$. If $P$ is a maximal ideal such that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$ then $P$ is finitely generated too.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nSuppose that $P^n$ is generated by $\\{x_1,\\dots,x_k\\}$. Let $L\\ne P$ be a maximal ideal. Let $s\\in P\\setminus L$. Then $s^n\\in P^n\\setminus L$. It follows that $s^nR_L=P^nR_L=PR_L=R_L$. So, there exists $i,\\ 1\\leq i\\leq k$ such that $PR_L=x_iR_L$. Since $R_P$ is coherent, $PR_P$ is finitely generated by Theorem \\ref{T:cohmax}. So, there exist $y_1, \\dots, y_m$ in $P$ such that $PR_P=y_1R_P+\\dots +y_mR_P$. Let $Q$ be the ideal generated by $\\{x_1,\\dots,x_k\\}\\cup\\{y_1,\\dots,y_m\\}$. Then $Q\\subseteq P$ and it is easy to check that $QR_L=PR_L$ for each maximal ideal $L$. Hence $P=Q$ and $P$ is finitely generated. \n\\end{proof}\n \nA ring $R$ is a {\\bf chain ring} if its lattice of ideals is totally ordered by inclusion, and $R$ is {\\bf arithmetical} if $R_P$ is a  chain ring for each maximal ideal $P$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{T:arith}\nLet $R$ be an arithmetical ring. If $P$ is a maximal ideal such that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$ then $P$ is finitely generated too.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nFirst, assume that $R$ is local. Let $P$ be its maximal ideal. Suppose that $P$ is not finitely generated and let $r\\in P$. Since $P\\ne Rr$ there exists $a\\in P\\setminus Rr$. So, $r=ab$ with $b\\in P$. It follows that $P^2=P$ and $P^n=P$ for each integer $n>0$. So, $P^n$ is not finitely generated for each integer $n>0$. Now, we do as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{T:main} to complete the demonstration. \n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{remark}\n\\textnormal{There exist arithmetical rings which are not coherent. In \\cite{MaZe15} several other examples of non-coherent rings which satisfy the conclusion of the previous theorem are given.}\n\\end{remark}\n\nLet $R$ be a ring. For a polynomial $f\\in R[X]$, denote  by $c(f)$ (the content of $f$) the ideal of $R$ generated by the coefficients of $f$. We say that $R$ is {\\bf Gaussian} if $c(fg)=c(f)c(g)$ for any two polynomials $f$ and $g$ in $R[X]$ (see \\cite{Tsa65}). A ring $R$ is said to be a {\\bf fqp-ring} if each finitely generated ideal $I$ is projective over $R/(0:I)$ (see \\cite[Definition 2.1 and Lemma 2.2]{AbJaKa11}).\n\nBy \\cite[Theorem 2.3]{AbJaKa11} each arithmetical ring is a fqp-ring and each fqp-ring is Gaussian, but the converses do not hold. The following examples show that Theorem \\ref{T:arith} cannot be extented to the class of fqp-rings and the one of Gaussian rings.\n\n\\begin{example}\nLet $R$ be a local ring and $P$ its maximal ideal. Assume that $P^2=0$. Then it is easy to see that $R$ is a fqp-ring. But $P$ is possibly not finitely generated.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{example}\nLet $A$ be a valuation domain (a chain domain), $M$ its maximal ideal generated by $m$ and  $E$ a vector space over $A/M$. Let $R=\\{\\binom{a\\ e}{0\\ a}\\mid a\\in A,\\ e\\in E\\}$ be the trivial ring extension of $A$ by $E$. We easily check that $R$ is a local fqp-ring. Let $P$ be its maximal ideal. Then $P^2$ is generated by $\\binom{m^2\\ 0}{0\\ m^2}$. But, if $E$ is of infinite dimension over $A/M$ then $P$ is not finitely generated over $R$ (see also \\cite[Theorem 2.3({\\it iv}){\\bf a})]{MaZe15}).   \n\\end{example}\n\n\\section{Powers of prime ideals}\\label{S:prime}\n\nBy \\cite[Theorem 1.8]{Roi01}, if $R$ is a coherent integral domain then each prime ideal whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too. The following example shows that this result does not extend to any coherent ring.\n\n\\begin{example}\\label{E:exa}\nLet $D$ be a valuation domain. Suppose there exists a non-zero prime ideal $L'$ which is not maximal. Moreover assume that $L'\\ne L'^2$ and let $d\\in L'\\setminus L'^2$. If $R=D/Dd$ and $L=L'/Dd$, then $R$ is a coherent ring, $L$ is not finitely generated and $L^2=0$.\n\\end{example}\n\n\\begin{remark}\nLet $R$ be an arithmetical ring. In the previous example we use the fact that each non-zero prime ideal $L$ which is not maximal is not finitely generated. In Theorem \\ref{T:arith1} we shall prove that $L^n$ is not finitely generated for each integer $n>0$ if $L$ is not minimal. \n\\end{remark}\n\nIn the sequel let $\\Phi=\\mathrm{Max}\\ R\\cup(\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R\\setminus\\mathrm{Min}\\ R)$ for any ring $R$.\n\nThe proof of the following theorem is similar to that of \\cite[Theorem 1.8]{Roi01}.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{T:mainP}\nLet $R$ be a coherent ring. Then, for any $P\\in\\Phi$, $P$ is finitely generated if $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof} Let $P\\in\\Phi$  such that $P^k$ is finitely generated for some integer $k>0$. By Theorem \\ref{T:cohmax} we may assume that $P$ is not maximal. So, there exists a minimal prime ideal $P'$ such that $P'\\subset P$. It follows that  $P^n\\ne 0$ for each integer $n>0$. By \\cite[Lemma 1.7]{Roi01} there exist an integer $n>1$ such that $P^n$ is finitely generated and $a\\in P^{n-1}\\setminus P^{(n)}$ where $P^{(n)}$ is the inverse image of $P^nR_P$ by the natural map $R\\rightarrow R_P$. This implies that $aP=aR\\cap P^n$. We may assume that $a\\notin P'$, else, we replace $a$ with $a+b$ where $b\\in P^n\\setminus P'$. Since $R$ is coherent, $aP$ and $(0:a)$ are finitely generated. From $a\\notin P'$ we deduce $(0:a)\\subseteq P'\\subset P$, whence $P\\cap (0:a)=(0:a)$. Hence $P$ is finitely generated.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corollary}\n\\label{C:mainCoh} Let $R$ be a reduced coherent ring. Then, for any prime ideal $P$, $P$ is finitely generated if $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$.\n\\end{corollary}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ such that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>1$. We may assume that $P\\ne 0$ and  by Theorem \\ref{T:mainP} that $P$ is minimal. So, $P^n\\ne 0$. It is easy to check that $(0:P)=(0:P^n)$ because $R$ is reduced. Since $R$ is coherent, it follows that $(0:P)$ is finitely generated. On the other hand, since $P^n$ is finitely generated, there exists $t\\in (0:P^n)\\setminus P$. This implies that $P=(0:(0:P))$. We conclude that $P$ is finitely generated.\n\\end{proof}\n\nAn exact sequence of $R$-modules $0 \\rightarrow F \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow 0$  is {\\bf pure}\nif it remains exact when tensoring it with any $R$-module. Then, we say that $F$ is a \\textbf{pure} submodule of $E$. The following proposition is well known.\n\\begin{proposition} \\cite[Proposition 2.4]{Couc09} \n\\label{P:purIdeal} Let $A$ be an ideal of a ring $R$. The following conditions are equivalent:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $A$ is a pure ideal of $R$;\n\\item for each finite family $(a_i)_{1\\leq i\\leq n}$ of elements of $A$ there exists $t\\in A$ such that $a_i=a_it,\\ \\forall i,\\ 1\\leq i\\leq n$;\n\\item for all $a\\in A$ there exists $b\\in A$ such that $a=ab$ (so, $A=A^2$);\n\\item $R/A$ is a flat $R$-module.\n\\end{enumerate} \nMoreover:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item if $A$ is finitely generated, then $A$ is pure if and only if it is generated by an idempotent;\n\\item if $A$ is pure, then $R/A=S^{-1}R$ where $S=1+A$.\n\\end{itemize} \n\\end{proposition}\n\nIf $R$ is a ring, we consider on $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R$ the equivalence relation $\\mathcal{R}$ defined by   $L\\mathcal{R} L'$ if there exists a finite sequence of prime ideals $(L_k)_{1\\leq k\\leq n}$ such that $L=L_1,$ $L'=L_n$ and $\\forall k,\\ 1\\leq k\\leq (n-1),$ either $L_k\\subseteq L_{k+1}$ or $L_k\\supseteq L_{k+1}$. We denote by $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ the quotient space of $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R$ modulo $\\mathcal{R}$ and by $\\lambda: \\mathrm{Spec}\\ R\\rightarrow\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ the natural map. The quasi-compactness of $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R$ implies the one of $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$, but generally $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$  is not  $T_1$: see \\cite[Propositions 6.2 and 6.3]{Laz67}. \n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{L:pure} \\cite[Lemma 2.5]{Couc09}. Let $R$ be a ring and let $C$ a closed subset of $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R$. Then $C$ is the inverse image of a closed subset of $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ by $\\lambda$ if and only if $C=V(A)$ where $A$ is a pure ideal. Moreover, in this case, $A=\\cap_{P\\in C}0_P$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\nIn the sequel, for each $x\\in\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ we denote by $A(x)$ the unique pure ideal which verifies   $\\overline{\\{x\\}}=\\lambda(V(A(x)))$, where $\\overline{\\{x\\}}$ is the closure of $\\{x\\}$ in $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$. \n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{T:main1} Let $R$ be a ring. Assume that $R/A(x)$ is coherent for each $x\\in\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$. Then, for any $P\\in\\Phi$, $P$ is finitely generated if $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$. \n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $P\\in\\Phi$ and $I=A(\\lambda(P))$. Suppose that $P^n$ is generated by $\\{x_1,\\dots,x_k\\}$. Let $L$ be a maximal ideal such that $I\\nsubseteq L$. As in the proof of Theorem \\ref{T:main} we show that $PR_L=x_iR_L$ for some integer $i,\\ 1\\leq i\\leq k$. By Theorem \\ref{T:mainP} $P/I$ is finitely generated over $R/I$. So, there exist $y_1, \\dots, y_m$ in $P$ such that ($y_1+I,\\dots ,y_m+I$) generate $P/I$. Let $Q$ be the ideal generated by $\\{x_1,\\dots,x_k\\}\\cup\\{y_1,\\dots,y_m\\}$. Then $Q\\subseteq P$ and it is easy to check that $QR_L=PR_L$ for each maximal ideal $L$. Hence $P=Q$ and $P$ is finitely generated. \n\\end{proof}\n\nFrom Corollary \\ref{C:mainCoh}, Theorem \\ref{T:main1} and the fact that $R/I$ is a localization of $R$ for each pure ideal $I$, we deduce the following.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{C:locCoh}\nLet $R$ be a reduced ring. Assume that $R/A(x)$ is coherent for each $x\\in\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$. Then, for any prime ideal $P$, $P$ is finitely generated if $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$. \n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{T:arith1}\nLet $R$ be an arithmetical ring. Then, for any $P\\in\\Phi$, $P$ is finitely generated if $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $P$ be a prime ideal. By Theorem \\ref{T:arith} we may assume that $P$ is not maximal.  Let $M$ be a maximal ideal containing $P$. If $P$ is not minimal then $P^nR_M$ contains strictly the minimal prime ideal of $R_M$ for each integer $n>0$. So, $P^nR_M\\ne 0$ for each integer $n>0$. On the other hand, since $R_M$ is a chain ring it is easy to check that $PR_M=MPR_M$. It follows that $P^nR_M=MP^nR_M$ for each integer $n>0$. By Nakayama Lemma we deduce that $P^nR_M$ is not finitely generated over $R_M$. Hence, $P^n$ is not finitely generated for each integer $n>0$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{remark}\n\\textnormal{Example \\ref{E:exa} shows that the assumption \"$P\\in\\Phi$\" cannot be omitted in some previous results. However, if each minimal prime ideal which is not maximal is idempotent then the conclusions hold for each prime ideal $P$.}\n\\end{remark}\n\n\\section{pf-rings}\\label{S:pf}\n\nNow, we consider the rings $R$ for which each prime ideal contains a unique minimal prime ideal. So, the restriction $\\lambda'$ of $\\lambda$ to $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ is bijective. In this case, for each minimal prime ideal $L$ we put $A(L)=A(\\lambda(L))$. By \\cite[Proposition IV.1]{Cou07} $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ is Hausdorff and  $\\lambda'$ is a homeomorphism if and only if $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ is compact. We deduce the following from Lemma \\ref{L:pure}.\n\n\\begin{proposition}\n\\label{P:pireg}\nLet $R$ be a ring. Assume that each prime ideal contains a unique minimal prime ideal. Then, for each minimal prime ideal $L$, $V(L)=V(A(L))$. Moreover, if $R$ is reduced then $A(L)=L$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof} If $R$ is reduced, then for each $P\\in V(L)$, $LR_P=0$ whence $L=0_P$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe say that a ring $R$ is a {\\bf pf-ring} if one of the following equivalent conditions holds:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $R_P$ is an integral domain for each maximal ideal $P$;\n\\item each principal ideal of $R$ is flat;\n\\item each cyclic submodule of a flat $R$-module is flat.\n\\end{enumerate}\nMoreover, if $R$ is a pf-ring then each prime ideal $P$ contains a unique minimal prime ideal $P'$ and $A(P')=P'$ by Proposition \\ref{P:pireg}.\n\nSo, from the previous section and the fact each minimal prime ideal of a pf-ring is idempotent, we deduce the following three results. Let us observe that each prime ideal of an arithmetical ring $R$ contains a unique minimal prime ideal because $R_P$ is a chain ring for each maximal ideal $P$.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\nLet $R$ be a coherent pf-ring. Then each prime ideal whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too. \n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{corollary}\n\\label{C:mainbis} Let $R$ be a pf-ring. Assume that $R/L$ is coherent for each minimal prime ideal $L$. Then each prime ideal whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too. \n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{corollary}\nLet $R$ be a reduced arithmetical ring. Then each prime ideal whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too.\n\\end{corollary}\n\nThe following three corollaries allows us to give some examples of pf-ring satisfying the conclusion of Corollary \\ref{C:mainbis}. Let $n$ be an integer $\\geq 0$ and $G$ a module over a ring $R$. We say that pd$\\ G\\leq n$ if Ext$^{n+1}_R(G,H)=0$ for each $R$-module $H$.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\nLet $R$ be a coherent ring. Assume that each finitely generated ideal $I$ satisfies pd$\\ I<\\infty$. Then each prime ideal whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too.\n\\end{corollary}\n\\begin{proof}\nBy, either \\cite[Th\\'eor\\`eme A]{Ber71} or \\cite[Corollary 6.2.4]{Gla89}, $R_P$ is an integral domain for each maximal ideal $P$. So, $R$ is a pf-ring.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corollary}\nLet $A$ be a ring and $X=\\{X_{\\lambda}\\}_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}$ a set of indeterminates. Consider the polynomial ring $R=A[X]$. Assume that $A$ is reduced and arithmetical. Then each prime ideal of $R$ whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too.\n\\end{corollary}\n\\begin{proof} Let $P$ be a maximal ideal of $R$ and $P'=P\\cap A$. Thus $R_P$ is a localization of $A_{P'}[X]$. Since $A_{P'}$ is a valuation domain, $R_P$ is an integral domain. So, $R$ is a pf-ring. Now, let $P$ be a minimal prime ideal of $R$ and $L$ be a minimal prime ideal of $A$ contained in $P\\cap A$. We put $A'=A/L$ and $R'=A'[X]$. So, $A'$ is an arithmetical domain (a Pr\\\"ufer domain). By \\cite[Proposition 8.2(b)]{Vas76} $R'$ is coherent. Since $R/P$ is flat over $R$ and $R'$, $R/P$ is a localization of $R'$. Hence $R/P$ is coherent. We conclude by Corollary \\ref{C:mainbis}.\n\\end{proof}\n \nLet $n$ be an integer $\\geq 0$. We say that a ring $R$ is of global dimension $\\leq n$ if pd$\\ G\\leq n$ for each $R$-module $G$.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\nLet $A$ be a ring and $X=\\{X_{\\lambda}\\}_{\\lambda\\in\\Lambda}$ a set of indeterminates. Consider the polynomial ring $R=A[X]$. Assume that $A$ is of global dimension $\\leq 2$. Then each prime ideal of $R$ whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too.\n\\end{corollary}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $P$ be a maximal ideal of $R$ and $P'=P\\cap A$. Thus $R_P$ is a localization of $A_{P'}[X]$. Since $A_{P'}$ is an integral domain by \\cite[Lemme 2]{LeB71}, $R_P$ is an integral domain. So, $A$ and $R$ are pf-rings. By \\cite[Proposition 2]{LeB71} $A/L$ is coherent for each minimal prime ideal $L$. Now, we conclude as in the proof of the previous corollary, by using  \\cite[Theorem 8.5]{Vas76}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\section{Minimal prime ideals}\n\\label{S:min}\n\n\n A topological space is called \\textbf{totally disconnected} if each of its connected components contains only one point. Every Hausdorff topological space $X$ with a base of clopen (closed and open) neighbourhoods is totally disconnected and the converse holds if $X$ is compact (see \\cite[Lemma 29.6]{Wil70}).\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{P:min1} Let $R$ be a ring. Let $P$ be a minimal prime ideal such that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$. Then $P$ is an isolated point of $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof}\nIt is well known that $V(I)\\cap\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ is a clopen subset of $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ for any finitely generated ideal $I$. Since $V(P^n)\\cap\\mathrm{Min}\\ R=\\{P\\}$, $P$ is an isolated point of $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ if $P^n$ is finitely generated.\n\\end{proof}\n\nFrom Theorems \\ref{T:main1} and \\ref{T:arith1} and Proposition \\ref{P:min1} we deduce the following theorem.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nLet $R$ be a ring. Assume that $R$ is either coherent or arithmetical and $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ contains no isolated point. Then, each prime ideal whose a power is finitely generated is finitely generated too. \n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{P:min} Let $R$ be a ring for which each prime ideal contains only one minimal prime ideal. Let $P$ be a minimal prime ideal such that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$. Then $\\lambda(P)$ is an isolated point of $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $P$ be a minimal prime ideal and $A=A(\\lambda(P))$. Clearly $\\lambda(P)=V(P)=V(A)$. Since $R/A$ is flat, we have  $A^2=A$. From $A\\subseteq P$ we deduce that $A\\subseteq P^2$. It follows that $A\\subseteq P^n$ for each integer $n>0$. Suppose that $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$. Since $P/A$ is the nilradical of $R/A$, $P^m=A$ for some integer $m\\geq n$. We deduce that $P^m=Re$ for some idempotent $e$ of $R$ by Proposition \\ref{P:purIdeal}. It follows that $\\lambda(P)=V(P^m)=D(1-e)$. Hence $\\lambda(P)$ is an isolated point of $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{P:disc}\nLet $X$ be a totally disconnected compact space, let $O$ be a ring with a unique point in $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ O$. Let $R$ be the ring of all locally constant maps from $X$ into $O$. Then, $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ is homeomorphic to $X$ and $R/A(z)\\cong O$ for each $z\\in\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof} If $U$ is a clopen subset of $X$ then there exists an idempotent   $e_U$  defined by $e_U(x)=1$ if $x\\in U$ and $e_U(x)=0$ else. Let $x\\in X$ and $\\phi_x:R\\rightarrow O$ be the map defined by $\\phi_x(r)=r(x)$ for every $r\\in R$. Clearly $\\phi_x$ is a ring homomorphism, and since $R$ contains all the constant maps, $\\phi_x$ is surjective. Let $x\\in X,\\ r\\in\\ker (\\phi_x)$ and $U=\\{y\\in X\\mid r(y)\\ne 0\\}$. Then $U$ is a clopen subset. It is easy to check that $e_U\\in\\ker (\\phi_x)$ and $r=re_U$. Since $\\ker (\\phi_x)$ is generated by idempotents, $R/\\ker (\\phi_x)$ is flat over $R$. For each $x\\in X$, let $\\Pi(x)$ be the image of $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ O$ by $\\lambda\\circ\\phi_x^a$ where $\\phi_x^a:\\mathrm{Spec}\\ O\\rightarrow\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R$ is the continuous map induced by $\\phi_x$.  We shall prove that $\\Pi:X\\rightarrow\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ is a homeomorphism. Clearly, $V(\\ker(\\phi_x))\\subseteq\\Pi(x)$. Conversely, let $P\\in\\Pi(x)$. Then there exists $L\\in V(\\ker(\\phi_x))$ such that $P\\mathcal{R} L$. We may assume that $L\\subseteq P$ or $P\\subseteq L$. The first case is obvious. For the second case let $e$ an idempotent of $\\ker(\\phi_x)$. Then, $e\\in L$, $(1-e)\\notin L$, $(1-e)\\notin P$ and $e\\in P$. We conclude that $V(\\ker(\\phi_x))=\\Pi(x)$ because $\\ker(\\phi_x)$ is generated by its idempotents. Let $x,y\\in X$, $x\\ne y$. By using the fact there exists a clopen subset $U$ of $X$ such that $x\\in U$ and $y\\notin U$ then $e_U\\in\\ker(\\phi_y)$ and $(1-e_U)\\in\\ker(\\phi_x)$. So, $\\ker(\\phi_x)+\\ker(\\phi_y)=R$, whence $\\Pi$ is injective. By way of contradiction suppose there exists a prime ideal $P$ of $R$ such that $\\ker(\\phi_x)\\nsubseteq P$ for each $x\\in X$. There exists an idempotent $e_x'\\in\\ker(\\phi_x)\\setminus P$ whence $e_x=(1-e_x')\\in P\\setminus\\ker(\\phi_x)$. Let $V_x$ be the clopen subset associated with $e_x$. Clearly $X=\\cup_{x\\in X}V_x$. Since $X$ is compact, a finite subfamily $(V_{x_i})_{1\\leq i\\leq n}$ covers $X$. We put $U_1=W_1=V_{x_1}$, and for $k=2,\\dots,n$, $W_k=\\cup_{i=1}^k V_{x_i}$ and $U_k=W_k\\setminus W_{k-1}$. Then $U_k$ is clopen for each $k=1,\\dots,n$. For $i=1,\\dots,n$ let $\\epsilon_i\\in R$ be the idempotent associated with $U_i$. Since $U_i\\subseteq V_{x_i}$, we have $\\epsilon_i=e_{x_i}\\epsilon_i$. So, $\\epsilon_i\\in P$ for $i=1,\\dots,n$. It is easy to see that $1=\\Sigma_{i=1}^n\\epsilon_i$. We get $1\\in P$. This is false. Hence $\\Pi$ is bijective. We easily check that $x\\in U$, where $U$ is a clopen subset of $X$, if and only if $\\Pi(x)\\subseteq D(e_U)$. Since $A(\\Pi(x))=\\ker(\\phi_x)$ is generated by its idempotents, $\\mathrm{pSpec}\\ R$ has a base of clopen neighbourhoods. We conclude that $\\Pi$ is a homeomorphism. \n\\end{proof}\n\nFrom Corollary \\ref{C:locCoh} we deduce the following proposition.\n\n\\begin{proposition}\nLet $R$ be the ring defined in Proposition \\ref{P:disc}. Assume that $O$ is a reduced coherent ring.  Then, for any prime ideal $P$, $P$ is finitely generated if $P^n$ is finitely generated for some integer $n>0$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{P:disc1} Let $R$ be the ring defined in Proposition \\ref{P:disc}. Assume that $O$ has a unique minimal prime ideal $M$. Then, every prime ideal of $R$ contains only one minimal prime ideal and $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ is compact. If $M=0$ then $R$ is a pp-ring, i.e. each principal ideal is projective.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof} If $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ then there exists a unique $x\\in X$ such that $P\\in\\Pi(x)$. So, $\\phi_x^a(M)$ is the only minimal prime ideal contained in $P$.\n\nAssume that $M=0$. Let $r\\in R$, $e=e_U$ where $U$ is the clopen subset of $X$ defined by $U=\\{x\\in X\\mid r(x)\\ne 0\\}$. We easily check that the map $Re\\rightarrow Rr$ induced by the multiplication by $r$ is an isomorphism. This proves that $R$ is a pp-ring.\n\nLet $R'$ be the ring obtained like $R$ by replacing $O$ with $O/M$. It is easy to see that $R'\\cong R/N$ where $N$ is the nilradical of $R$. So, $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ and  $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R'$ are homeomorphic. Since $R'$ is a pp-ring, $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R$ is compact by \\cite[Proposition 1.13]{Vas76}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nFrom Theorems \\ref{T:main1} and \\ref{T:arith1} and Propositions \\ref{P:min} and \\ref{P:disc1} we deduce the following corollary.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{C:disc1} Let $R$ be the ring defined in Proposition \\ref{P:disc}.

If $P$ is a maximal ideal of $R$ whose a power is finitely generated then we prove that $P$ is finitely generated if $R$ is either locally coherent or arithmetical or a polynomial ring over a ring of global dimension $\\leq 2$. And if $P$ is a prime ideal of $R$ whose a power is finitely generated then we show that $P$ is finitely generated if $R$ is either a reduced coherent ring or a polynomial ring over  a reduced arithmetical ring. These results extend a theorem of Roitman, published in 2001, on prime ideals of coherent integral domains.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nAll rings are commutative and unitary. In this paper the following question is studied:\n\n{\\bf question A}: Suppose that some power $P^n$ of the prime ideal $P$ of a ring $R$ is finitely generated. Does it follows that $P$ is finitely generated?\n\nWhen $P$ is maximal it is the {\\it question 0.1} of \\cite{GiHeRo99}, a paper by Gilmer, Heinzer and Roitman. The first author posed this question in \\cite[p.74]{Gil72}. In \\cite{GiHeRo99} some positive answers are given to the {\\it question 0.1} (see \\cite[for instance, Theorem 1.24]{GiHeRo99}), but also some negative answers (see \\cite[Example 3.2]{GiHeRo99}). The authors proved a very interesting result ( \\cite[Theorem 1.17]{GiHeRo99}): a reduced ring $R$ is Noetherian if each of its prime ideals has a finitely generated power. This {\\it question 0.1} was recently studied in \\cite{MaZe15} by Mahdou and Zennayi, where some examples of rings with positive answers are given, but also some examples with negative responses. In \\cite{Roi01} Roitman investigated the {\\bf question A}. In particular, he proved that $P$ is finitely generated if $R$ is a coherent integral domain (\\cite[Theorem 1.8]{Roi01}).\n\nWe first study {\\it question 0.1} in Section \\ref{S:max}. It is proven that $P$ is finitely generated if $R$ is either locally coherent or arithmetical. In Section \\ref{S:prime} we investigate {\\bf question A} and extend the Roitman's result. We get a positive answer when $R$ is a reduced ring which is either coherent or arithmetical. If $R$ is not reduced, we obtain a positive answer for all prime ideals $P$, except if $P$ is minimal and not maximal. In Section \\ref{S:pf}, by using Vasconcelos's results, we deduce that {\\bf question A} has also a positive response if $R$ is a polynomial ring over either a reduced arithmetical ring or a ring of global dimension $\\leq 2$. In Section \\ref{S:min}, we consider rings of constant functions defined over a totally disconnected compact space $X$ with values in a ring $O$ for which a quotient space of $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ O$ has a unique point, and we examine when these rings give a positive answer to our questions. This allows us to provide some examples and counterexamples. \n\n We denote respectively $\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R$, $\\mathrm{Max}\\ R$ and $\\mathrm{Min}\\ R,$ the\nspace of prime ideals, maximal ideals and minimal prime ideals of\n$R$, with the Zariski topology. If $A$ a subset of $R$, then we denote $(0:A)$ its annihilator and \n", "index": 1, "text": "\n\\[V(A) = \\{ P\\in\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R\\mid A\\subseteq P\\}\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ \\ D(A) =\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R\\setminus V(A).\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"V(A)=\\{P\\in\\mathrm{Spec}\\ R\\mid A\\subseteq P\\}\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ \\ D(A)=\\mathrm{%&#10;Spec}\\ R\\setminus V(A).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><mi>Spec</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2223</mo><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2286</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow><mo rspace=\"7.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>and</mi></mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><mi>Spec</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow><mo>\u2216</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
