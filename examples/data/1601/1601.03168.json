The blue region thus represents the\n$Z_2$ topological phase ($Z_2=1$), while the red region represents the\nnormal phase (topologically trivial, $Z_2=0$). The parity inversion at\nthe $\\Gamma$ point for the $p$-$d$ reversed photonic bands dictate the\n$Z_2$ topology\\cite{fuprb}.

An example has been demonstrated above for the relation\nbetween the double Dirac cone and the photonic $Z_2$ topological\ninsulator. The Berry phase of each band is closely related to the\nformation of the photonic topological states. Usually, topological\nnodal points are the critical states between normal band gaps and\ntopological insulators. By introducing time/parity breaking\nperturbations, the double-Dirac-cone state can become a photonic\nquantum anomalous Hall insulator ($Z$ topological insulator) or a\n$Z_2$ topological insulator, or a trivial photonic band gap material,\ndepending on the specific gap opening perturbations\\cite{onoda}. \nOur study includes the triangle photonic crystals with dielectric rods\nas a special limit of $R_2$=0. From the phase diagram, it is clear that\nthe $p$-$d$ band inversion cannot be attained using dielectric rods with\n$R_2$=0. Thus the dielectric rod photonic crystals cannot support double\nDirac cone. They can only support Dirac-like cone due to $s$-$p$\ndegeneracy or quadratic band touching due to $s$-$d$ degeneracy. For the\ninverse structure a simple air cylinder can only support $s$-$d$\ndegeneracy.\n\n\nWe plot in Fig.~3 the band structures of different kinds of accidental\ndegeneracy's marked by the black points in Fig.~2. In Figs.~3(a) and\n3(b), the linear dispersion due to the accidental degeneracy of the\nsinglet $s$ mode and the doubly degenerate $p$ modes are plotted, leading\nto the Dirac-like cone. The Dirac-like cone is associated with a cone\nand a flat band intersecting at the Dirac point. Its effective\nHamiltonian is ${\\cal H}=v_0{\\vec k}\\cdot {\\vec S}$  where $\\vec{S}$\nis the pseudo-spin 1 consisting of three modes $s$, $p_x$, and\n$p_y$\\cite{ct2d}. $v_0$ is the group velocity around the Dirac\npoint. The upper, lower and flat bands have pseudo-spin along the wave\nvector direction as 1, -1, and 0, respectively. \n\n\n\nThe Dirac-like cone can emerge in photonic crystals with $R_2=0$\n(cylinder rods) as well as for finite $R_2$ (hollow cylinders). The\nphotonic dispersions for these two situations are illustrated in\nFigs.~3(a) and 3(b), respectively. Another Dirac-like cone dispersion\nis shown in Fig.~3(c) due to accidental degeneracy of the singlet $f$\nmode and the doubly degenerate $d$ modes. Linear, conical dispersion\nappears for the $s$-$p$ and $d$-$f$ degeneracy's because the parity of\nthe $s$ and $p$ ($d$ and $f$) modes are different. According to the\n${\\vec k}\\cdot{\\vec P}$ theory\\cite{mei2,mei3}, the linear in $k$ coupling\nbetween two photonic bands originates from the $P$ matrix element\nwhich is finite only between bands with different parities. For bands\nwith the same parity, such coupling is quadratic\\cite{mei2,mei3}. The\nquadratic dispersion around the touching point of the $s$ and $d$\nbands is shown in Fig.~3(d), while the quadratic band touching around\nthe $f$-$p$ degeneracy is shown in Fig.~3(e).\n\nThe accidental degeneracy of the $p$ doublets and the $d$ doublets\n[Fig.~3(f)] carries nontrivial topological properties which are the\nmain focus of this work. Since the parity of the $p$ modes and the $d$\nmodes are different, the dispersion around the accidental degeneracy is\nconical. The two fold degeneracy's of the $p$ and $d$ bands result in a\ndouble Dirac cone that resembles the dispersion of Dirac's famous\nequation for electron and positron with vanishing mass in 2D systems.\n\n\n\\begin{widetext}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=13cm]{Fig3.pdf}\n\\caption{ (Color online) Band structures of different kinds of\n  accidental degeneracy.

The\nemergence of topological states of matter raises new challenges in\nunderstanding the states of matter and phase transitions. Topological\nstates of matter offer new physics and applications in electronic\nsystems such as topological insulators and topological semimetals\n(e.g., graphene\\cite{graphene}). The conical dispersions in topological semimetal\nand the helical edge states of topological insulators are found to be\nuseful for a lot of applications\\cite{TIreview}. Since Haldane and Raghu's seminal\nwork which brought the quantum anomalous Hall effect to the realm of\nphotonics\\cite{Raghu}, more and more researches are focused on the topological\neffects in photonic crystals (PhCs)\\cite{phTI}. \n\n\nPhCs are periodically arranged dielectric materials which break the\ncontinuous translation symmetry that gives the dispersion of light in\nhomogeneous materials. The resulting photonic spectrum is the photonic\nenergy bands similar to the electronic energy bands in solid\ncrystals\\cite{eli,sajeev}. The emergence of photonic energy bands and band gaps\nintroduces tremendous advantages in manipulating light\\cite{book}. Unlike\nprevious studies on trapping light with photonic band gaps, in this\nwork we focus on the nodal points in photonic bands in two-dimensional\n(2D) triangle PhCs. We examine their relationships with Dirac (and\nDirac-like) points and topological phase transitions. Nontrivial Berry\nphases assign a topological winding number to the nodal points, making\nthem mother states of quantum spin Hall insulators and quantum\nanomalous Hall insulators (denoted as the $Z_2$ and $Z$ topological\ninsulators, respectively)\\cite{TIreview,qahe}. The topological nodal points studied here\nare induced by accidental degeneracy's instead of deterministic\ndegeneracy's due to, e.g., nonsymmorphic or sublattice symmetry (e.g.,\nin photonic  graphene\\cite{ph-gra}). Accidental degeneracy in 2D PhCs have\nattracted a lot of research attention in recent years. In square\nlattice photonic crystals, a conical Dirac-like dispersion\\cite{ct2d} was found\ntheoretically. At the Dirac point the photonic crystal can be regarded\nas a lossless effective medium of zero refractive index\\cite{ct2d,Sakoda}. \n\n\nPhotonic analog of time-reversal symmetric $Z_2$ topological\ninsulators using bi-anisotropic metamaterials was\nproposed\\cite{z2-ph}, where the coupling between the electric field\nand magnetic field plays the same role as the spin-orbit coupling in\nelectronic $Z_2$ topological insulators. Recently, the topological\nphase transition between normal photonic band gap materials and a\nphotonic $Z_2$ topological insulator was proposed in 2D PhCs using\nnormal dielectric materials with isotropic\npermittivity\\cite{huxiao}. The 2D PhCs that realize such a transition\nis a triangle lattice where there are six cylinders in each unit cell\nforming a pattern with $C_{6}$ symmetry. By tuning the position of the\ncylinders a photonic band gap carrying $Z_2$ topology can be formed.\nAt the boundary between the $Z_2$ topological phase and the trivial\nphase, a double Dirac cone is formed precisely at the geometry that\nthe lattice becomes a honeycomb\\cite{huxiao}. Therefore, the double\nDirac cone is induced by a deterministic degeneracy due to the\nsublattice symmetry of the honeycomb lattice. Recently Dirac-cones are\nstudied in PhCs\\cite{Sakoda,pgs} and phononic crystals\\cite{mei}.\n\nIn this work, we propose a simpler realization of the photonic analog\nof the $Z_2$ topological insulator, using core-shell dielectric\nmaterials. There is only a single core-shell cylinder at the center of\neach unit cell. The core-shell structure has\ncontinuous rotation symmetry which is compatible with the largest\npoint group symmetry $C_{6v}$ of the triangle lattice.\nThis provides the condition for the realization of the $Z_2$ topological\nphase. Moreover, it off the possibilities to achieve various\ndegeneracy's such as Dirac-like cone, double Dirac cone, and quadratic\nband touching. We systematically calculate the accidental degeneracy's\nat the Brillouin zone center and the topological phase transitions in\nthe 2D core-shell dielectric PhCs.  The core-shell triangle photonic\ncrystal structure is simple and mechanically stable and hence it is\ncompatible with colloidal\\cite{colloid} self-assembled structure as\nwell as biological systems\\cite{bio}. Our study shows how topological\nphases of photons can be realized in simple 2D dielectric PhCs and\nvarious phases can be induced by tuning the geometry of the dielectric\nmaterials.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{Fig1.pdf}\n\\caption{ (Color online) (a) Schematic configuration of a triangle PhC\n  using core-shell dielectric materials.

As will be shown below the 2D triangle PhCs can\nhost several kinds of topological nodal points. These nodal points are\nthe mother states of different types of photonic topological\ninsulators. In the triangle lattice, the $\\Gamma$ point has two kinds\nof 2D irreducible representations in the $C_{6v}$ symmetry, which are\ndenoted as the $E_1$ and $E_2$ representations,\nrespectively\\cite{sa-book}. The associated Bloch waves are referred as the\n$E_1$ and $E_2$ modes, respectively. Each representation has two Bloch\nwaves, which can be reorganized into a pair of modes connected by\ntime-reversal operation. Here the relevant modes are the\n$p_{+}=p_x+ip_y$ and $p_-=p_x-ip_y$ modes, which are denoted as\n(pseudo-) spin up and spin down states of the $p$ bands. Similarly, the\n$d_{+}=d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ and $d_-=d_{x^2-y^2}-id_{xy}$ modes are\ndenoted as the (pseudo-) spin up and spin down states for the $d$\nbands. \n\nThe 2D core-shell dielectric structure in triangle lattice is shown in\nFig.~1(a). Its outer and inner radii are denoted as $R_1$ and $R_2$,\nrespectively. The dielectric constant of the core-shell material and\nthe background material are ${\\varepsilon}_1$ and ${\\varepsilon}_2$, respectively. The\nlattice constant is set as $a_1=a_2\\equiv 1$. We define the inverse\nstructure by the \nexchange of ${\\varepsilon}_1$ and ${\\varepsilon}_2$. The inverse structure is hence a\ncore-shell air cylinder in dielectric background. Our architecture is\none of the simplest 2D PhCs that can support rich physics of\ntopological nodal points and topological phase transitions. \n\nBy numerically solving the Maxwell's equations for transverse\nmagnetic (TM) harmonic modes, of which the electric field is along the\ncore-shell cylinder (i.e., the $z$ direction). Fig.~1(b) shows a typical\nband structure of the PhC. The band structure is calculated by COMSOL\nbased on the finite-element method. In this band structure, the\neigen-modes at the $\\Gamma$ point exhibit orbital symmetry of the $s,\np, d$ and $f$ waves from low frequency to high frequency. These modes\ncorrespond to the $A_1$, $E_1$, $E_2$ and $B_1$ modes of the $C_{6v}$\npoint group symmetry\\cite{sa-book}. The labeling of bands with $s$,\n$p$, $d$ and $f$ modes is only effective at the $\\Gamma$ point which\npossesses the $C_{6v}$ symmetry. Away from the $\\Gamma$ point these\nmodes mix with each other and their order in frequency may\nchange. Nevertheless, the labels clearly reveal the accidental band\ndegeneracy and band inversion at the $\\Gamma$ point. Besides, the $s,\np, d$ and $f$ modes carry physical meanings. The photonic bands can be\nviewed as derived from transfer (hopping) of local Mie resonances of\nthe core-shell structures between adjacent unit cells. Such a\ntight-binding understanding of the photonic bands has successfully\nconnected the photonic bands with the Mie resonances of $s, p$ and $d$\nsymmetries\\cite{tb,kivshar}. Thus the Mie resonances can be regarded\nas the ``atomic orbits'' for photonic energy bands, as it plays the\nsame role as the atomic orbits in electronic energy bands.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.7cm]{Fig2.pdf}\n\\caption{ (Color online) Phase diagram of the $p$-$d$ inversion induced\n  photonic $Z_2$ topological insulator in the $R_1$-$R_2$ parameter\n  space.

By continuously changing the radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ or the\ndielectric constant, different bands cross each other, leading to\naccidental degeneracy's at the $\\Gamma$ point. The accidental\ndegeneracy usually results in linear or quadratic dispersion.

The two fold degeneracy's of the $p$ and $d$ bands result in a\ndouble Dirac cone that resembles the dispersion of Dirac's famous\nequation for electron and positron with vanishing mass in 2D systems.\n\n\n\\begin{widetext}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=13cm]{Fig3.pdf}\n\\caption{ (Color online) Band structures of different kinds of\n  accidental degeneracy.

The $p$-$d$ inversion at the\n$\\Gamma$ point leads to the formation of photonic $Z_2$ topological\ninsulators which have helical edge states. The phase transition from\nnormal photonic band gaps with trivial topology to the photonic $Z_2$\ntopological insulator takes place at the black line in Fig.~2, where\nthe double Dirac cone emerges. The key information in Fig.~2 is the\nappearance of two regions support photonic topological insulators (the\ntwo blue regions). This takes place for hollow dielectric cylinders\nwith large outer and inner radii, or for hollow air cylinders with\nsmall inner radius. We remark that although the $p$-$d$ band gap of\nthe $Z_2$ topological insulator can be quite large at the $\\Gamma$\npoint, $\\sim 40\\%$, for both normal and reversed structures, the complete\nphotonic band gap is reduced, particularly for the inverse\nstructure. The photonic $Z_2$ topological insulators have helical edge\nstates which can enable unprecedented manipulation of light flow. For\nexample, light propagation can be controlled by the orbital angular\nmomentum. We shall discuss the properties of the edge states below. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Fig4.pdf}\n\\caption{ (Color online) Relationship between $\\ln({\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2)$ and the\n  critical inner radius $R_2$ where the double Dirac cone emerges.

In most photonic crystals\nthe photonic band gap increases with the permittivity ratio\n${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$\\cite{book}. Here we find that, quite interestingly,\nthe phase boundary between the $Z_2$ topological insulator and the\nnormal photonic band gap changes negligibly for a {\\em very broad\n  range} of the permittivity ratio. This interesting property is\ndemonstrated in Fig.~4 where we examine the phase boundary along the\n$R_2$ axis for different permittivity ratio ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$ for fixed\nouter radius $R_1$. The critical value of $R_2$ where the double Dirac\ncone emerges is insensitive to the permittivity ratio ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$\nin a very wide range. Although the calculation is done for $R_1=0.45$,\nthe observed behavior holds true for other values of the outer radius\n$R_1$. In fact, we have chosen the $R_1$ in the calculation such that\nthe dependence of the critical value of $R_2$ on the permittivity\nratio ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$ is the strongest. The regions with negative\nvalue of $\\ln({\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2)$ in Fig.~4 stands for the inverse\nstructure photonic crystal. The horizontal axis represents the case\nwith ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2=1$, i.e., the homogenous limit. In the homogeneous\nlimit the photonic band gaps vanish and all the photonic bands become\nplane waves. Thus they cannot be associated with the $s, p, d,$ and\n$f$ symmetries. The homogeneous limit is a singular limit for the\ndiscussion the topological nodal points and $p$-$d$ inversion. This\nexplains the discontinuity of, e.g., the $s$-$p$ band \ncrossing curve for the normal and inverse structure in the phase\ndiagram upon crossing the homogeneous limit. Nonetheless, the $p$-$d$\nband crossing seems to undergo a ``continuous transition'' from the\nnormal structure to the inverse structure. The possible physical\nscenario in approaching the homogeneous limit is that the plane-wave\ncomponent continuously increase to 100\\%, while the $s, p, d, f$ wave (the\nlocal Mie resonances of the hollow cylinder) components gradually\nvanish in approaching the homogeneous limit.\n\n\n\\begin{widetext}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{ (Color online) Topology induced edge states.

First, let us consider the $G$ and $H$ points in\nFig.2. The $G$ point has normal band structure, while the $H$ point is a\nphotonic $Z_2$ topological insulator. There is a common complete band gap\nmarked by the cyan region in Figs.~5(a) and 5(b). When these two photonic crystals\nare put together, there is topology induced edge states. The $Z_2$\ntopology is protected by the pseudo-time-reversal symmetry. The\npseudo-time-reversal operation is ${\\cal T}_p=i\\hat{\\sigma}_y{\\cal T}$\nwith ${\\cal T}=\\hat{K}$ (the complex conjugation operator) being the\ngenuine time-reversal operator. Here $\\hat{\\sigma}_y$ is an operator\nacting on the pseudo-spin space for both the $p$ and $d$ bands which\ncan be written as a combination of the $C_{6v}$ symmetry\noperations (see Ref.~\\onlinecite{huxiao}) to ensure that ${\\cal\n  T}_p^2=-1$. The latter \n                         \n                         \n                         \n                         \nis crucial in mimicking electronic $Z_2$ topological insulator in\nphotonic crystals. The pseudo-spin matrices transform as \nfollows, under pseudo-time-reversal operation, $\\sigma_i\\to -\n\\sigma_i$ for $i=x,y,z$. Under the genuine time-reversal operation,\n$\\sigma_z\\to -\\sigma_z$, $\\sigma_x\\to \\sigma_x$, and\n$\\sigma_y\\to\\sigma_y$, because $\\hat{K}|{\\uparrow}\\rangle=|{\\downarrow}\\rangle$ and\n$\\hat{K}|{\\uparrow}\\rangle=|{\\downarrow}\\rangle$ (since $|{\\uparrow}\\rangle=|p_x+ip_y\\rangle$ and\n$|{\\downarrow}\\rangle=|p_x-ip_y\\rangle$ for $p$ bands, while\n${\\uparrow}\\rangle=|d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}\\rangle$ and\n$|{\\downarrow}\\rangle=|d_{x^2-y^2}-id_{xy}\\rangle$ for the $d$ bands).\n\n\nThe $C_{6v}$ symmetry breaks down at the boundary between\nthe two photonic crystals. Hence the boundary introduces perturbations\nthat gap the helical edge states. The size of the gap depends on the\nstrength of the perturbation. However, since the bulk topology of the\ntwo photonic crystals is distinct, there is topology guaranteed\nedge states, although they may {\\em not} be gapless. This is the \nessential feature for bosonic analog of the $Z_2$ topological\ninsulators. A typical calculation of the edge states is presented in\nFig.5(c). The helical edge states are gapped at $k_x=0$. Away from the\n$k_x=0$ point the helical feature of the edge states is clearly\ndemonstrated in Figs.5(d) and 5(e). The edge states at the $B$ point is\nmostly spin-down (due to the perturbation that gaps the $k_x=0$ point,\nthe $B$ point  mix slightly with spin-up) as recognized from the\nreal space distribution of the Poynting vector. Similarly the $A$ point\nis mostly spin up and it has positive group velocity, while the $B$\npoint has negative group velocity. Hence the helical character of the\nedge states is preserved except near the $k_x=0$ point.\n\n\nIn some situations the two photonic crystals do not share a common\nphotonic band gap. We can slightly change the ${\\varepsilon}_1$ or ${\\varepsilon}_2$ of the\nstructure to get the common photonic band gap. Since the $p$-$d$ inversion\ndepends negligibly on the ratio of the two permittivity, this does not\nchange the topological properties of the photonic crystals. For\nexample, if the photonic crystal with normal band structure has\n$R_1$=0.45, $R_2$=0.2, ${\\varepsilon}_1$=9, and ${\\varepsilon}_2$=1 [see in Fig.~6(a)],\nwhile the photonic crystal with nontrivial $Z_2$ topology has\n$R_1$=0.45, $R_2$=0.3, ${\\varepsilon}_1$=12, and ${\\varepsilon}_2$=1 [see in\nFig.~6(b)]. The two photonic crystals have a common band gap marked by\nthe cyan ribbon. When those two photonic crystals are put together the\ntopology induced edge states are found [see in Fig.~6(c)].\n\nFrom symmetry considerations, the boundaries break the\npseudo-time-reversal symmetry but still keeps the (genuine)\ntime-reversal symmetry. The spin-operators that are even under\ntime-reversal operation are the $\\hat{\\sigma}_x$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_y$.\nThus there can be two types of ``mass terms'' that gap the edge\nstates. The general form of the edge Hamiltonian that obeys the\ntime-reversal symmetry is ${\\cal H}_{edge}= v\nk_x\\hat{\\sigma}_z + m_x\\hat{\\sigma}_x + m_y\\hat{\\sigma}_y$ where $v$ is the group\nvelocity, $m_x$ and $m_y$ are two real quantities.

We show that such a\nsimple photonic crystal can support $Z_2$ photonic topological\ninsulators. Compared with previous proposal of $Z_2$ photonic topological\ninsulators, our architecture is much simpler and hence feasible for\nfabrications and experiments. The edge states of the $Z_2$ topological\ninsulators, unlike for electronic systems, are not ensured to be\ngapless. Nevertheless, they show properties similar to the helical\nedge states in electronic systems, such as spin-dependent propagation\ndirections. We also give a full phase diagram for the topological\nnodal points, Dirac-like cones and double Dirac cones, for various\ngeometric parameters. These topological nodal points are proximate to\ntopologically nontrivial photonic band gaps. The physical origin of\nthe topological nodal points as well as their properties such as Berry\nphase, (pseudo-)spin-orbit coupling are revealed. Dirac cones at\n${\\vec k}=0$ can be exploited to tune the effective refractive index\nto the range $-1<n({\\omega})<1$ which are unattainable in \nnatural (lossless) materials. These properties, together with the \nBerry phases of photon, offer great potential for future advanced\nphotonics.\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements} \nWe thank supports from the National Science Foundation of China for\nExcellent Young Scientists (grant no. 61322504).

The phase transition from\nnormal photonic band gaps with trivial topology to the photonic $Z_2$\ntopological insulator takes place at the black line in Fig.~2, where\nthe double Dirac cone emerges. The key information in Fig.~2 is the\nappearance of two regions support photonic topological insulators (the\ntwo blue regions). This takes place for hollow dielectric cylinders\nwith large outer and inner radii, or for hollow air cylinders with\nsmall inner radius. We remark that although the $p$-$d$ band gap of\nthe $Z_2$ topological insulator can be quite large at the $\\Gamma$\npoint, $\\sim 40\\%$, for both normal and reversed structures, the complete\nphotonic band gap is reduced, particularly for the inverse\nstructure.

In most photonic crystals\nthe photonic band gap increases with the permittivity ratio\n${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$\\cite{book}. Here we find that, quite interestingly,\nthe phase boundary between the $Z_2$ topological insulator and the\nnormal photonic band gap changes negligibly for a {\\em very broad\n  range} of the permittivity ratio. This interesting property is\ndemonstrated in Fig.~4 where we examine the phase boundary along the\n$R_2$ axis for different permittivity ratio ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$ for fixed\nouter radius $R_1$. The critical value of $R_2$ where the double Dirac\ncone emerges is insensitive to the permittivity ratio ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$\nin a very wide range. Although the calculation is done for $R_1=0.45$,\nthe observed behavior holds true for other values of the outer radius\n$R_1$. In fact, we have chosen the $R_1$ in the calculation such that\nthe dependence of the critical value of $R_2$ on the permittivity\nratio ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2$ is the strongest. The regions with negative\nvalue of $\\ln({\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2)$ in Fig.~4 stands for the inverse\nstructure photonic crystal. The horizontal axis represents the case\nwith ${\\varepsilon}_1/{\\varepsilon}_2=1$, i.e., the homogenous limit. In the homogeneous\nlimit the photonic band gaps vanish and all the photonic bands become\nplane waves. Thus they cannot be associated with the $s, p, d,$ and\n$f$ symmetries. The homogeneous limit is a singular limit for the\ndiscussion the topological nodal points and $p$-$d$ inversion. This\nexplains the discontinuity of, e.g., the $s$-$p$ band \ncrossing curve for the normal and inverse structure in the phase\ndiagram upon crossing the homogeneous limit. Nonetheless, the $p$-$d$\nband crossing seems to undergo a ``continuous transition'' from the\nnormal structure to the inverse structure. The possible physical\nscenario in approaching the homogeneous limit is that the plane-wave\ncomponent continuously increase to 100\\%, while the $s, p, d, f$ wave (the\nlocal Mie resonances of the hollow cylinder) components gradually\nvanish in approaching the homogeneous limit.\n\n\n\\begin{widetext}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{ (Color online) Topology induced edge states.

First, let us consider the $G$ and $H$ points in\nFig.2. The $G$ point has normal band structure, while the $H$ point is a\nphotonic $Z_2$ topological insulator. There is a common complete band gap\nmarked by the cyan region in Figs.~5(a) and 5(b). When these two photonic crystals\nare put together, there is topology induced edge states. The $Z_2$\ntopology is protected by the pseudo-time-reversal symmetry. The\npseudo-time-reversal operation is ${\\cal T}_p=i\\hat{\\sigma}_y{\\cal T}$\nwith ${\\cal T}=\\hat{K}$ (the complex conjugation operator) being the\ngenuine time-reversal operator. Here $\\hat{\\sigma}_y$ is an operator\nacting on the pseudo-spin space for both the $p$ and $d$ bands which\ncan be written as a combination of the $C_{6v}$ symmetry\noperations (see Ref.~\\onlinecite{huxiao}) to ensure that ${\\cal\n  T}_p^2=-1$. The latter \n                         \n                         \n                         \n                         \nis crucial in mimicking electronic $Z_2$ topological insulator in\nphotonic crystals. The pseudo-spin matrices transform as \nfollows, under pseudo-time-reversal operation, $\\sigma_i\\to -\n\\sigma_i$ for $i=x,y,z$. Under the genuine time-reversal operation,\n$\\sigma_z\\to -\\sigma_z$, $\\sigma_x\\to \\sigma_x$, and\n$\\sigma_y\\to\\sigma_y$, because $\\hat{K}|{\\uparrow}\\rangle=|{\\downarrow}\\rangle$ and\n$\\hat{K}|{\\uparrow}\\rangle=|{\\downarrow}\\rangle$ (since $|{\\uparrow}\\rangle=|p_x+ip_y\\rangle$ and\n$|{\\downarrow}\\rangle=|p_x-ip_y\\rangle$ for $p$ bands, while\n${\\uparrow}\\rangle=|d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}\\rangle$ and\n$|{\\downarrow}\\rangle=|d_{x^2-y^2}-id_{xy}\\rangle$ for the $d$ bands).\n\n\nThe $C_{6v}$ symmetry breaks down at the boundary between\nthe two photonic crystals. Hence the boundary introduces perturbations\nthat gap the helical edge states. The size of the gap depends on the\nstrength of the perturbation. However, since the bulk topology of the\ntwo photonic crystals is distinct, there is topology guaranteed\nedge states, although they may {\\em not} be gapless. This is the \nessential feature for bosonic analog of the $Z_2$ topological\ninsulators. A typical calculation of the edge states is presented in\nFig.5(c). The helical edge states are gapped at $k_x=0$. Away from the\n$k_x=0$ point the helical feature of the edge states is clearly\ndemonstrated in Figs.5(d) and 5(e). The edge states at the $B$ point is\nmostly spin-down (due to the perturbation that gaps the $k_x=0$ point,\nthe $B$ point  mix slightly with spin-up) as recognized from the\nreal space distribution of the Poynting vector. Similarly the $A$ point\nis mostly spin up and it has positive group velocity, while the $B$\npoint has negative group velocity. Hence the helical character of the\nedge states is preserved except near the $k_x=0$ point.\n\n\nIn some situations the two photonic crystals do not share a common\nphotonic band gap. We can slightly change the ${\\varepsilon}_1$ or ${\\varepsilon}_2$ of the\nstructure to get the common photonic band gap. Since the $p$-$d$ inversion\ndepends negligibly on the ratio of the two permittivity, this does not\nchange the topological properties of the photonic crystals. For\nexample, if the photonic crystal with normal band structure has\n$R_1$=0.45, $R_2$=0.2, ${\\varepsilon}_1$=9, and ${\\varepsilon}_2$=1 [see in Fig.~6(a)],\nwhile the photonic crystal with nontrivial $Z_2$ topology has\n$R_1$=0.45, $R_2$=0.3, ${\\varepsilon}_1$=12, and ${\\varepsilon}_2$=1 [see in\nFig.~6(b)]. The two photonic crystals have a common band gap marked by\nthe cyan ribbon. When those two photonic crystals are put together the\ntopology induced edge states are found [see in Fig.~6(c)].\n\nFrom symmetry considerations, the boundaries break the\npseudo-time-reversal symmetry but still keeps the (genuine)\ntime-reversal symmetry. The spin-operators that are even under\ntime-reversal operation are the $\\hat{\\sigma}_x$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_y$.\nThus there can be two types of ``mass terms'' that gap the edge\nstates. The general form of the edge Hamiltonian that obeys the\ntime-reversal symmetry is ${\\cal H}_{edge}= v\nk_x\\hat{\\sigma}_z + m_x\\hat{\\sigma}_x + m_y\\hat{\\sigma}_y$ where $v$ is the group\nvelocity, $m_x$ and $m_y$ are two real quantities. The magnitude of\nthe two masses, $m_x$ and $m_y$, depend on the specific\ngeometry of the boundary. The energy gap at $k_x=0$ is\n$2\\sqrt{m_x^2+m_y^2}$. Finally, we remark that if $m_x$ and $m_y$ are \nposition-dependent, they can induce additional Berry-phase that modulates\nphoton propagation along the boundary.\n\n\n\\section{APPLICATION POTENTIALS}\n\nThe effective refractive index of the photonic crystal can be positive\nor negative, depending on the frequency of the light. By matching the\nfrequency and wave vector parallel to the boundary, we find, in\nagreement with Ref.~\\onlinecite{refrac}, that the effective refractive index\nis frequency dependent, \n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nn({\\omega}) =\n\\frac{\\sin(\\theta_1)}{\\sin(\\theta_2)}=\\frac{2{\\omega}_0}{|A|c}\\left(\\frac{{\\omega}-{\\omega}_0}{{\\omega}}\\right) ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"n({\\omega})=\\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{1})}{\\sin(\\theta_{2})}=\\frac{2{\\omega}_{0}}{|A|%&#10;c}\\left(\\frac{{\\omega}-{\\omega}_{0}}{{\\omega}}\\right),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
