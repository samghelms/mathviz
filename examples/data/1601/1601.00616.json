[{"file": "1601.00616.tex", "nexttext": "\nIt is relatively straightforward to determine $q$ by measuring the\nrotational broadening of the photospheric lines $v\\sin i$\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{wu+2015b}. Usually, the greatest challenge is obtaining\nan accurate estimate of $i$, since none of the BHSXTs discovered to date\nexhibits an X-ray eclipse, as discussed by \\citet{narayan+2005}.\n\nWhile estimates of $i$ have been obtained for three BHSXTs by modeling\njet data \\citep[e.g.][]{fender+1999,steiner+2012b,steiner+2012a}, the\ncommon approach to constraining $i$ is to model multi-color optical/NIR\nlight curves while the system is in {\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ quiescence.  Ideally,\nduring each orbital cycle the ellipsoidal light curve of the\ntidally-distorted secondary, which fills its Roche lobe, shows two\nequal maxima and two unequal minima. A near-ideal example of such a\nlight curve is that of GRO~J1655$-$40 for which several groups have\nobtained estimates of $i$ that are in good agreement\n\\citep{orosz+1997,vanderhooft+1998,greene+2001,beer+2002}. In fact,\nGRO~J1655$-$40 is the only BHSXT for which the error in the black hole\nmass is dominated by the uncertainties in the mass function and the mass\nratio, rather than the uncertainty in $i$ \\citep{casares+2014}.\n\nFor most BHSXTs, however, the quiescent ellipsoidal optical/NIR light\ncurves are contaminated by a non-stellar contribution from the accretion\ndisk (and possibly the jet). This component, which can vary rapidly,\noften distorts the light curve, and it sometimes completely conceals the\nellipsoidal modulation. This ``disk-veiling'' issue is most problematic\nfor the short-period systems (defined here as $P<$12~hrs) which\ngenerally have relatively faint $K$- or $M$-type\nsecondaries. \\citet{kreidberg+2012} discuss three types of non-stellar\noptical/NIR emission. One is a constant ``pedestal'' level of emission\nfrom the disk that dilutes the amplitude of the ellipsoidal modulation.\nThe second is a component that varies periodically with the orbital\nperiod of the system, producing asymmetric distortions in the light\ncurves, thereby increasing or decreasing the amplitude of the\nellipsoidal-component of modulation. We model this component as\nemission from a wedge-shaped hotspot on the disk. These two disk\ncomponents of light can be included in the light-curve model.\n\nIn addition, there is a third and more problematic component, namely,\naperiodic flickering due to variability in the accretion\nflow. \\citet{cantrell+2008} elucidated this component by identifying two\nprincipal distinct optical state for A0620$-$00 in quiescence, the {\\it\n  passive} and {\\it active} states.  Cantrell et al.\\ concluded that\nonly light curves in the passive state, which have minimal aperiodic\nvariability, are suitable for modeling in order to estimate $i$; those\nin the active state are dominated by aperiodic flickering and are\nunsuitable.  Cantrell et al.\\ also found that A0620$-$00 in the active\nstate is brighter than in the passive state by by $\\sim0.3$ mag,\nwhich is expected as the accretion disk ``builds up'' during quiescence\n\\citep{lasota+2001}.  \\citet{kreidberg+2012} further investigated the\npotential systematic uncertainties of using active-state data in\nestimating $i$ and $M$.\n\nIn summary, accurate measurements of $i$ and $M$ for BHSXTs requires\nthat one selects and models light curves obtained in the passive quiescent\nstate. Even in this case, careful modeling of the pedestal and hotspot\ncomponents is required; this is particularly true in the case of the\nshort-period systems, such as A0620--00 and {NovaMus}.  However, in most\nearlier studies of BHSXTs, the disk contribution was only crudely\nestimated, or it was ignored altogether, while no distinctions were drawn\nbetween passive- and active-state data.  Consequently, in a number of\ncases, there has been wide disagreement in the inclination estimates\nthat have been obtained for the same system \\citep[see summary in\nTable~1 of][]{casares+2014}.\n\nEarlier studies of {NovaMus}\\ have provided estimates of $f(M)$, $q$, $i$,\nand $M$ \\citep[e.g.,][]{orosz+1996,casares+1997,gelino+2001}.  However,\nin no case has the disk contribution to the optical/NIR light curves\nbeen robustly constrained. In the most recent work, \\citet{gelino+2001}\nobtained an estimate of $i=54^\\circ \\pm1.5^\\circ$ by modeling the $J$\nand $K$ band light curves assuming that the disk contribution is\nnegligible, an assumption that was subsequently shown to be ill-founded\n\\citep{reynolds+2008,kreidberg+2012}. Based on the mass measurement of\nGelino et~al., \\citet{morningstar+2014}\nfound a retrograde spin ($a_*=-0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.64}$) for the black hole\nin {NovaMus}, which is a remarkable result for a black hole in a BHSXT,\ngiven that the spin of the black hole is believed to be accrued\ngradually over the lifetime of the system via accretion torques\n\\citep{fragos+2015}.\n\nIn this work, we present the first accurate measurements of the\ninclination of the binary system and the mass of the black hole, as well\nas an estimate of distance. The accuracy of our results derives from (i)\nthe unprecedented quality of our determination of the disk veiling and\nthe quality of our radial velocity data; (ii) use of the first reliable\nmeasurement of the mass ratio $q$; and (iii) the exclusive use of\npassive light-curve data in modeling the ellipsoidal variability,\nnamely, data obtained shortly after the system returned to quiescence\nfollowing its 1991 outburst \\citep{orosz+1996}. In our earlier paper\non the dynamics of {NovaMus}\\ \\citep[hereafter Paper~I]{wu+2015b}, we \nextensively discuss items (i) and (ii).  Meantime, item (iii) is a\nfeature topic of this work (\\S\\ref{lc:pick}).\n\nAs elaborated in \\citetalias{wu+2015b}, in 2009 we tackled the problem\nof the variable \ncomponent of non-stellar emission by making phase-resolved spectroscopic\nand photometric observations of {NovaMus}\\ that were strictly simultaneous\n($<1$~s).  The spectroscopic and photometric data were both collected at\nLas Campanas Observatory using the Magellan/Clay 6.5~m and du~Pont 2.5~m\ntelescopes, respectively.  We obtained 72 high-resolution spectra using\nthe Magellan Echellette spectrograph (MagE; \\citealt{marshall+2008}),\nwhich cover the wavelength range 3000--10000~\\AA.  Based on independent\nmeasurements for several echellette orders, we obtained the following\nprecise and robust results: $K_2=406.8\\pm2.7$~km~s$^{-1}$ and $v\\sin\ni=85.0\\pm2.6$~km~s$^{-1}$, which respectively imply $f(M)=3.02\\pm0.06\\\nM_\\odot$ and $q=0.079\\pm0.007$.  Of paramount importance for this work\nin modeling the light curves, we obtained a precise constraint on the\nfraction of the light due to the disk in 2009: $56.7\\pm1.4\\%$ in the\n$V$-band. \n\nIn this work, we use the results described above from\n\\citetalias{wu+2015b} to model \nthe multi-color light curves of {NovaMus}\\ in order to obtain reliable\nestimates of $M$, $i$, $D$, and other parameters for {NovaMus}. The structure\nof this paper is as follows. In \\S\\ref{lc}, we first document the steady\nbrightening of {NovaMus}\\ during quiescence. Then, from all available data,\nwe select the light curves that are suitable to model, and for each\nlight curve we constrain the fraction of the light contributed by the\ndisk. In \\S\\ref{model} we detail the procedures we use to model the\ndata, and we present the final adopted values of $M$ and $i$, and all\nother model parameters.  In \\S\\ref{dist} we estimate the distance to\n{NovaMus}, a parameter that is crucial for measuring the spin via the\ncontinuum-fitting method. Our summary and discussion are presented in\n\\S\\ref{discuss}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Photometric Data}\\label{lc}\n\n\\subsection{Optical Brightening of {NovaMus}\\ during X-ray\n  Quiescence}\\label{lc:smarts}\n\nThe $V$-band light curve we obtained in 2009 contains a strong and\nvariable, non-stellar component of light \\citepalias{wu+2015b}, and it is\ngrossly inferior for ellipsoidal modeling compared to the passive-state\nlight curves obtained in 1992--1993 by \\citet{orosz+1996}.  Furthermore,\nthe system was 0.65 mag brighter in $V$ in 2009 than it was in\n1992--1993.  These results motivated us to investigate how {NovaMus}\\\nbrightened during this period, whether regularly and gradually, or\nchaotically.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=5in,angle=90]{fig1.ps}\n    \\caption{\\footnotesize{SMARTS light curves of {NovaMus}\\ for the period\n        2003--2015 in the $V$-band (upper panel; filled cyan circles)\n        and in the $I$-band (lower panel; filled red circles). The\n        dashed line and rate of brightening given in each panel are the\n        result of a linear fit to the data.  The filled black square\n        represents our mean $V$-band magnitude of {NovaMus}\\ obtained in\n        2009 with the du~Pont telescope.}\n    \\label{smarts_fig}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nLong-term photometric monitoring of {NovaMus}\\ in {\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ quiescence has\nbeen performed on a near-nightly basis using the Small and Moderate\nAperture Research Telescope System\n(SMARTS)\\footnote{\\url{http://www.astro.yale.edu/smarts.}}.  We made\nuse of the $V$- and $I$-band photometric data for the years\n2003--2015, sans 2010. The data set comprises 556 frames in the $V$\nband and 592 frames in the $I$ band (Fig.~\\ref{smarts_fig}).  We\nperformed differential photometry using nearby, calibrated \nstandard stars with $V-I$ colors similar to those of {NovaMus}.  Our\nestimates of photometric error (shown in Fig.~\\ref{smarts_fig}), which are\nstatistical, are typically $\\sim0.05$~mag for the $V$-band and\n$\\sim0.04$~mag for the $I$-band.  Our estimate of the uncertainty in\nthe zero point for each band is $\\sim0.05$~mag.\n\nFig.~\\ref{smarts_fig} shows for both bands a clear trend of brightening\nof {NovaMus}\\ over the course of 12 years. Applying a least-square linear\nregression to all the data points, we find that {NovaMus}\\ brightened at a\nrate of $0.0357\\pm0.0006$~mag~yr$^{-1}$ in the $V$-band and\n$0.0199\\pm0.0004$~mag~yr$^{-1}$ in the $I$-band.  {\\it This is the first\n  direct evidence of a gradual and a near-linear brightening of a BHSXT\n  during X-ray quiescence.} It is worth noting that the rate of\nbrightening is greater in the $V$-band than the $I$-band; i.e., the\npedestal of disk emission becomes bluer as the system brightens. This\nmay be caused by an increase in the temperature of the disk, or by a\nchange in the structure of the disk (e.g., a decrease in the inner-disk\nradius).\n\nThe brightening is predicted by the disk instability model \\citep[DIM;\nfor a review see][]{lasota+2001}.  According to the DIM, and as these\nlight curves show, after its return to quiescence following an outburst\nthe disk of a BHSXT slowly but steadily builds via accretion, and the\nsystem brightens as the pedestal component grows \\citep[see Fig.~3\nof][]{dubus+2001}.  Meanwhile, the DIM does not predict the growth of\naperiodic flickering and the distortions that develop in the ellipsoidal\nlight curves as the quiescent system transitions from the passive\noptical state to the active state \\citep{cantrell+2008}. According to\nthe DIM, eventually a disk instability is triggered and a new outburst\nbegins when the surface density of the disk at some radius reaches a\ncritical value.  The outburst recurrence time for BHSXTs can be years or\ndecades. {NovaMus}\\ has remained in quiescence for 24 years, ever since its\nonly known outburst in 1991.  By including disk irradiation and\ntruncation into the instability model, while modeling the inner\naccretion flow as an advection dominated accretion flow\n\\citep[ADAF;][]{narayan+1994}, \\citet{dubus+2001} reproduced the long\nrecurrence times for BHSXTs.\n\n\\subsection{Selection of Light Curves}\\label{lc:pick}\n\nAs discussed above, only light curves obtained in the passive state are\nuseful in attempting to constrain the inclination. Unfortunately, the\nhigh-quality $V$-band data we obtained in 2009 using the du~Pont\ntelescope are unsuitable because {NovaMus}\\ was in an active state, as\nevidenced by strong aperiodic flickering \\citepalias[see Fig.~8\nof][]{wu+2015b}.  Likewise, the SMARTS light curves are dominated by\naperiodic variations, showing that {NovaMus}\\ has been in an active state\nsince at least 2003. Therefore, the du~Pont and SMARTS light curves\ncannot be expected to provide reliable constraints on the inclination.\n\nWe therefore turned to examine the highest-quality archival light curves\nin the literature, namely, those of \\citet{orosz+1996} and\n\\citet{gelino+2001}, while passing over the $H$-band light curve of\n\\citet{shahbaz+1997} because of its less desirable quality. We first\ndiscuss the light curves of \\citet{orosz+1996}.  They were obtained in\n1992--1995, shortly after the 1991 outburst of {NovaMus}, and they are thus\nminimally contaminated by disk emission. The authors present light\ncurves in two bands: a $B+V$-band and a wide $I$-band, which have\ncentral wavelengths of $\\approx5000$~\\AA\\ and $\\approx9000$~\\AA,\nrespectively.  Orosz et al.\\ report that in 1992 {NovaMus}\\ had a $V$-band\nmagnitude of $20.51\\pm0.07$, which was fainter than we observed in 2009\nby $0.66\\pm0.09$ mag.  Based on these two data points, the average\nrate of brightening for the 17-year period 1992--2009 is\n$0.0388\\pm0.0053$~mag~yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with the rate\nof $0.0357\\pm0.0006$~mag~yr$^{-1}$ determined using SMARTS data for\n2003--2015 (\\S\\ref{lc:smarts}).\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{fig2a.ps}\\\\\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.4in]{fig2b.ps}\n    \\caption{\\footnotesize{The 1992 $I$-band light curve and the\n    best-fit models with a disk spot (upper panel) and without a\n    disk spot (lower panel).

Meanwhile, we also choose to model the\n$B+V$-band light curve (see upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{lc2_fig}), which\nwas obtained during the same year, even though it is distorted,\npresumably by emission from a spot on the disk (see \\S\\ref{intro}).  We\nfurther selected the $J$-band light curve of \\citet{gelino+2001}, which\nappears to be relatively free of aperiodic variations and dominated by\nellipsoidal modulation, while ignoring their relatively poor quality\n$K$-band light curve.\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{lcccc}\n\\tabletypesize{\\footnotesize}\n\\tablecaption{Fraction of Disk Emission for Three Light Curves\\label{veiling_table}}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablehead{ \\colhead{Light Curve} &  \\colhead{Mean $V$-band} & &\n  \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Disk Fraction (\\%)} \\\\\n\\cline{4-5}\n\\colhead{} & \\colhead{Magnitude} & & \\colhead{$V$-band} & \\colhead{$I$-band}\n}\n\\startdata\n2009 $V$ & $19.85\\pm0.05$ & & $56.7\\pm1.4$ & $42.1\\pm2.8$ \\\\\n1992 $B+V$, $I$ & $20.51\\pm0.07$ & & $20.5^{+6.1}_{-6.6}$ &\n$12.5^{+4.2}_{-4.3}$ \\\\\n2001 $J$ & $20.83\\pm0.45$ & & $<29.5$ & $<18.8$\n\\enddata\n\\end{deluxetable}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{lccl}[t]\n\\tabletypesize{\\footnotesize}\n\\tablecaption{List of ELC Model Parameters\\label{parlist_table}}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablehead{ \\colhead{Parameter} &  \\colhead{Lower} & \\colhead{Upper} &\n  {Definition (unit)} \\\\ \n\\colhead{} & \\colhead{Bound} & \\colhead{Bound} & \\colhead{}\n}\n\\startdata\n$i$ & 30 & 80 & Inclination (deg) \\\\\n$K_2$ & 395 & 420& Radial velocity semi-amplitude of the secondary (km s$^{-1}$) \\\\\n$M_2$ & 0.3 & 1.5 & Mass of the secondary ($M_\\odot$) \\\\\n$\\Delta\\phi$ & -0.015 & 0.015 & Phase shift (deg) \\\\\n$r_{\\rm out}$ & 0.300 & 0.999 & Radius of the outer rim of the accretion disk\\tablenotemark{a} \\\\\n$\\beta_{\\rm rim}$ & 0.5 & 22.5 & Opening half-angle of the disk rim (deg)\\\\\n$T_{\\rm disk}$ & 3000 & 49000 & Temperature of the inner rim of the disk (K)\\\\\n$\\xi$ & -0.99 & -0.10 & Power-law index of the disk temperature profile \\\\\n$s_{\\rm spot}$ & 0.6 & 15 & The scale applied to obtain the disk spot\ntemperature \\\\\n$r_{\\rm cut}$ & 0.05 & 1.0 & Cut-off radius of the disk spot\\tablenotemark{b} \\\\\n$\\theta_{\\rm spot}$ & 0 & 360 & Azimuth of the disk spot (deg) \\\\\n$w_{\\rm spot}$ & 3 & 90 & Angular size of the disk spot (deg) \\\\\n\\hline\n$M$ & \\nodata & \\nodata & Mass of the black hole ($M_\\odot$) \\\\\n$K_1$ & \\nodata & \\nodata & Radial velocity semi-amplitude of the\nBlack Hole (km s$^{-1}$)\\\\\n$\\log g_2$ & \\nodata & \\nodata & Surface gravity of the secondary (cm~s$^{-2}$)\n\\\\\n$R_2$ & \\nodata & \\nodata & Radius of the secondary ($R_\\odot$)\\\\\n$a$ & \\nodata & \\nodata & Separation between the centers of the black\nhole and the secondary ($R_\\odot$)\\\\\n$v\\sin i$ & \\nodata & \\nodata & Rotational Velocity of the secondary (km~s$^{-1}$)\n\\enddata\n\\tablecomments{The first set of parameters and their bounds are fit\nparameters, and the second set are derived parameters.}\n\\tablenotetext{a}{In units of the effective Roche lobe radius of the black hole.}\n\\tablenotetext{b}{In units of the disk radius.}\n\\end{deluxetable*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Constraining the Fraction of Disk Emission}\\label{lc:veil}\n\nAlthough simultaneous spectroscopic data were not obtained for our\nselected light curves, we are still able to constrain the fraction of\ndisk emission (referred to hereafter as the disk fraction) using the\nresults derived from our simultaneous spectroscopic/photometric campaign\nin 2009 presented in \\citetalias{wu+2015b}.  Following\n\\citet{cantrell+2010}, we make the reasonable assumption that the flux\nfrom the secondary star remains constant, and that the change in\nbrightness of the system originates solely from the accretion disk.\n\nDuring our 2009 observations, the mean $V$ magnitude of {NovaMus}\\ was\n$19.85\\pm0.05$, with the accretion disk contributing $56.7\\pm1.4$\\% of\nthe total light \\citepalias{wu+2015b}.  This implies a magnitude for the\nsecondary star alone of $m_{\\rm V}=20.76\\pm0.06$.  During 1992, the mean $V$\nmagnitude of {NovaMus}\\ was $20.51\\pm0.07$ \\citep{orosz+1996}, just\n$0.25\\pm0.09$ mag brighter than the star alone.  Thus, in 1992\nthe disk fraction was only $20.5^{+6.1}_{-6.6}$\\% (Table~\\ref{veiling_table}).\n\nWith these $V$-band results in hand, we estimated the disk fraction for\nthe $I$-band using the spectral energy distribution model presented in\n\\S4.2 of \\citetalias{wu+2015b}.  The model assumes a blackbody spectrum\nwith an effective temperature of 4400~K for the stellar component and a\npower-law spectrum for the disk component (see Fig.~7 of\n\\citetalias{wu+2015b}). Extrapolating the power-law component, we obtain\nfor 1992 a disk fraction of $12.5^{+4.2}_{-4.3}$\\% in the $I$-band.\n\nUsing the same procedure, we estimated the disk fraction for the 2001\n$J$-band light curve (Table~\\ref{veiling_table}).\nHowever, in this case we only have a crude\nestimate of the mean $V$-band magnitude of {NovaMus}\\ because\n\\citet{gelino+2001} report just a single measurement of $V$-band\nmagnitude, $20.83\\pm0.06$, with no time-stamp.  Thus, the orbital phase\nof the observation is unknown, and we therefore adopt an uncertainty of\n${\\Delta}m_{\\rm V} = 0.45$ mag, i.e., the full amplitude of the 2009\n$V$-band light curve.  Using this magnitude and our model, we constrain\nthe disk fractions in the $V$- and $I$-bands in 2001 to be $<29.5\\%$ and\n$<18.8\\%$, respectively.

The ELC code generates model light curves that include\ncontributions from both the secondary star and the accretion disk,\nincluding an allowance for emission from a hot spot on the disk.  The\nsecondary star is assumed to be in a circular orbit, rotating\nsynchronously, and filling its Roche lobe.  We fix the effective\ntemperature of the secondary to be $T_2=4400\\pm100$~K based on the\nresults of our cross correlation analysis (see \\S3.1 and Fig.~2 of\n\\citetalias{wu+2015b}); meanwhile our ELC models are insensitive to the\nadopted value of $T_2$.  We ignore {\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ heating because the quiescent\n{\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ luminosity of {NovaMus}\\ is minuscule ($L_{\\rm X}\\sim\n4\\times10^{31}$~erg~s$^{-1}$; \\citealt{sutaria+2002}).\n \nThe fit and derived parameters of the ELC models are listed in\nTable~\\ref{parlist_table}.  There are four key fit parameters: the\ninclination $i$, $K$-velocity of the secondary $K_2$, mass of the\nsecondary $M_2$ and a relative phase shift $\\Delta\\phi$.  Our measured\nvalues of $K_2$ ($=406.8\\pm2.7$~km~s$^{-1}$) and $v\\sin i$\n($=85.0\\pm2.6$~km~s$^{-1}$) reported in \\citetalias{wu+2015b} are used to\ngenerate the prior probability distribution for each of the four\nparameters.  The posterior probability distribution of the parameters\ngenerated by the ELC code are required to agree closely with the\nmeasured values, which serves as a consistency check on the modeling\nprocess. We fix the orbital period to be $P=0.43260249(9)$~d (Table~2 of\n\\citetalias{wu+2015b}).\n\nThere are four additional fit parameters that characterize the emission\nfrom the accretion disk: 1) the radius of the outer rim of the disk\n$r_{\\rm out}$, expressed in units of the effective Roche lobe radius of\nthe primary \\citep{eggleton+1983}; 2) the half opening angle of the\naccretion disk $\\beta_{\\rm rim}$; 3) the temperature of the inner edge\nof the disk $T_{\\rm disk}$; and 4) the power-law index of the\ntemperature profile along the disk radius $\\xi$.  For those models that\ninclude a hotspot along the outer rim of the accretion disk, there are\nfour additional fit parameters: $s_{\\rm spot}$ (the scaling factor\nused to derive the spot temperature from the disk temperature); $r_{\\rm\n  cut}$ (the inner cut-off radius of the spot); $\\theta_{\\rm spot}$ (the\nazimuth of the disk spot relative to the line connecting the center of\nthe primary and secondary); and $w_{\\rm spot}$ (the angular width of the\ndisk spot).\n\nFor each fit parameter, we set a range of physically and/or\ngeometrically reasonable values (see Table~\\ref{parlist_table}), some of\nwhich are based on the results in \\citetalias{wu+2015b}.  For each set of\ntrial values of the parameters, and for a particular filter band, the\nELC code generates a model light curve.  The observed light curves are\nfitted to the model curves using a variety of optimizing techniques\n\\citep[see details in \\S5.2.1 of][]{orosz+2014}.  After a large number\nof trials, the model giving the global minimum $\\chi^2$ is\nadopted. Other systemic parameters, such as the black hole mass $M$ and\nthe radius of the secondary $R_2$, are derived using this best-fit model\n(see Table~\\ref{parlist_table}).\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=6in]{fig4.ps}\n    \\caption{\\footnotesize{The $\\chi^2$ curves for the fit\n    parameters.

Compared to the 2001 $J$-band light curve,\nthe constraint on the disk fraction for the $I$-band light curve is\ntighter and the disk was significantly fainter in 1992 ($\\sim0.3$~mag;\n\\S\\ref{lc:smarts}).  We therefore choose the 1992 $I$-band light curve\nas our primary data set. \n\nWe generated a total of 2.5 million model light curves using the ELC\ncode for the 1992 $I$-band data. The models include emission from the\nsecondary star and from the disk, which is comprised of a steady\ncomponent and a periodically variable component due to a hotspot.  The\nmodel light curve that yields the minimum $\\chi^2$ is identified.  The\ncorresponding fit parameter values are listed in the second column of\nTable~\\ref{parfit_table}.  For all 2.5 million models, we plotted the\nparameter value vs. $\\Delta\\chi^2$.  In\nFigs.~\\ref{chi21_fig}~and~~\\ref{chi22_fig}, we show respectively for\nthe fit parameters and the derived parameters only the outer envelope\ndefined by the mass of points.  The three dashed lines shown in each\npanel correspond to $\\Delta\\chi^2=1,4,9$. The points of intersection of\nthese lines with the envelope define respectively the $1\\sigma$,\n$2\\sigma$, $3\\sigma$ uncertainty range of the parameter in question.\nFor some fit parameters (e.g., $T_{\\rm disk}$) there is only a one-sided\nconstraint; in these cases, in Table~\\ref{parfit_table} we quote\n$1\\sigma$ lower/upper limits.\n\nFor our primary data set, the 1992 $I$-band light curve, the observed\nand model light curves, and fit residuals, are shown in the upper panel\nof Fig.~\\ref{lc1_fig}.  The model curve is itself shown decomposed into\ncontributions from the secondary and from the disk in the top panel of\nFig.~\\ref{lcde_fig}.  As this figure makes clear, both the constant and\nvariable components of disk emission are relatively unimportant.\n\nWe also fitted the 1992 $I$-band light curve with models with no hotspot\ncomponent.  The values of the fit parameters, which are given in the\nthird column of Table~\\ref{parfit_table}, are in good agreement with\nthose obtained for the model that includes a spot. However, the quality\nof the fit is significantly poorer, as shown by an inspection of the fit\nresiduals, which show evidence of modulation at the orbital period\n(lower panel of Fig.~\\ref{lc1_fig}).\n\nWe further fitted the 1992 $B+V$-band and $I$-band light curves jointly,\nand the 2001 $J$-band light curve, including the hotspot in both cases,\nand we find results that are consistent with those obtained for our\nprimary data set.  The results are listed in the fourth and fifth\ncolumns of Table~\\ref{parfit_table}, respectively.  The disk fractions\nwe used (including both the constant and hotspot emission) are those\ngiven in Table~\\ref{veiling_table}.  In both cases, the best-fit\nparameters are consistent with those obtained for our primary data set,\nthe 1992 $I$-band light curve.  Furthermore, in all cases the values of\n$K_2$ and $v\\sin i$ returned by the models agree well with our measured\nvalues given in \\citetalias{wu+2015b}.  Thus, the fit results for all\nthree light curves are consistent, and the models in all cases are in\ngood agreement with our dynamical data.\n\nAn inspection of Fig.~\\ref{lcde_fig}, which shows the model light curves\ndecomposed into stellar and disk components, makes clear the principal\nvirtue of the 1992 $I$-band light curve (top panel), namely, that its\nellipsoidal component is minimally contaminated by the hotspot\ncomponent, as well as being minimally diluted by the steady disk\ncomponent. Confirmation that disk contamination was minimal during this\nperiod is provided by comparing the results of two Doppler tomographic\nstudies: No hotspot was detected in a 1994--1995 tomogram\n\\citep{casares+1997}, while a prominent hotspot, located where the gas\nstream strikes the disk, is present in a 2009--2010 tomogram\n\\citep{peris+2015}.\n\nTable~\\ref{orbital_table} summarizes our final, key results for {NovaMus}.\nThe mass of the black hole is $M=11.0^{+2.1}_{-1.4}\\ M_\\odot$.  The mass\nof the secondary star is slightly less than a solar mass\n($M_2=0.89^{+0.18}_{-0.11}\\ M_\\odot$).  The relation between the two\nmasses, given our constraints on $q$ and $i$, are summarized in\nFig.~\\ref{massdia_fig}.  The vertical solid line on the left marks the\nhard lower limit on $M$ imposed by our measurement of the mass function,\nand the slant solid lines show the constraints imposed by our measured\nvalues of $q$ and $i$, while the dotted and dashed lines indicate\n$1\\sigma$ errors, respectively.  The gray-shaded area defines the\n$1\\sigma$ range of uncertainty in this $M$--$M_2$ diagram.  In the\nfollowing section we will use the radius of the secondary\n($R_2=1.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}~R_\\odot$), which is essentially the solar\nvalue, to estimate the distance of {NovaMus}.\n\n\\bibpunct[; ]{(}{)}{;}{a}{}{,}\n\nThe black hole mass we find is significantly greater than the\n$M=6.95\\pm0.6\\ M_\\odot$ value reported by \\citet[also see\n  \\citealt{gelino+2004}]{gelino+2001}, which is \nprimarily because our estimate of inclination is lower, $43.2^\\circ$\nvs. $54^\\circ$.  That Gelino et al.\\ obtained a higher inclination while\nignoring the disk emission is contrary to the usual expectation because\nignoring a pedestal of light causes one to underestimate the inclination\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{kreidberg+2012}.  The present case is unusual because\nthe pedestal of light is relatively unimportant and the effect of the\nhotspot is dominant.  Our model shows that about half the total\nmodulation of the 2001 $J$-band light curve is due to the hot spot\ncomponent (Fig.~\\ref{lcde_fig}).  Gelino et al.\\ did not include this\ncomponent and they therefore overestimated the inclination.\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{deluxetable}{lcl}\n\\tabletypesize{\\footnotesize}\n\\tablecaption{Key Parameters for {NovaMus}\\ \\label{orbital_table}}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablehead{ \\colhead{Parameter} & \\colhead{} & \\colhead{Value}\n}\n\\startdata\nMass function $f(M/M_\\odot)$ & & $3.02\\pm0.06$ \\\\\nMass ratio $q$ & & $0.079\\pm0.007$ \\\\\nInclination $i$ (deg) & & $43.2^{+2.1}_{-2.7}$ \\\\\nBlack hole mass $M$ ($M_\\odot$) & & $11.0^{+2.1}_{-1.4}$ \\\\\nSecondary mass $M_2$ ($M_\\odot$) & & $0.89^{+0.18}_{-0.11}$ \\\\\nSecondary radius $R_2$ ($R_\\odot$) & & $1.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$ \\\\\nSeparation $a$ ($R_\\odot$) & & $5.49^{+0.32}_{-0.24}$ \\\\\nDistance $D$ (kpc) & & $4.95^{+0.69}_{-0.65}$\n\\enddata\n\\tablecomments{The quoted uncertainties are at the $1\\sigma$ level of\n  confidence.}\n\\end{deluxetable}\n\\end{center}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig6.ps}\n    \\caption{\\footnotesize{The model light curve for each filter band\n        (solid line) shown decomposed into the stellar component (dotted\n        line) and the disk component (dashed line).

We first determined the hypothetical\nabsolute magnitude of the secondary star $\\mathcal{M_{\\rm V}}$ as viewed at its \nsurface (i.e., at a distance $D = R_2$, rather than the canonical\ndistance of 10 pc) using the most recent stellar atmosphere models of\nlate-type stars.  Then, using our apparent $V$-band magnitude corrected\nfor reddening, and our estimate of the star's radius, we computed the\ndistance of {NovaMus}.\n\nWe utilize the BT-Settl stellar atmosphere models developed by\n\\citet{allard+2012a,allard+2012b}\\footnote{The most recent model library\n  is available online at\n  \\url{https://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/BT-Settl/CIFIST2011\\_2015/.}}.\nThese models provide the magnitude $\\mathcal{M_{\\rm V}}$ of the star at\nthe stellar surface for a variety of filter bands over a wide grid of\neffective temperatures (in steps of 100~K) and surface gravities (in\nlogarithmic steps of 0.5).  For {NovaMus}, the effective temperature is\n$T_2=4400\\pm100$~K (\\S\\ref{model:elc}) and the surface gravity is $\\log\ng_2=4.34^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ (Table~\\ref{parfit_table}).  Averaging the\nentries in the table for models in the range $\\log g=4.0-4.5$ with\n$T_2$ fixed at 4400~K, we find $\\mathcal{M_{\\rm V}}=-36.72$.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig7.ps}\n    \\caption{\\footnotesize{Constraints on the masses of the primary and\n        secondary shown in the $M-M_2$ plane; the $1\\sigma$ range of\n        uncertainty is indicated by the gray-shaded region.} \n    \\label{massdia_fig}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe uncertainty in $\\mathcal{M_{\\rm V}}$ associated with this range of\n$\\log g$ and the 100~K uncertainty in $T_2$ is 0.19~mag.  It is\nalso important to assess the uncertainty in the model of\n\\citeauthor{allard+2012a} For this purpose, we selected several stars\nwith values of $T_2$ and $\\log g$ close to those of the secondary for\nwhich $\\mathcal{M_{\\rm V}}$ can be deduced purely from observational\ndata \\citep{boyajian+2012}.  The data for these stars generally agree\nwith the models of \\citeauthor{allard+2012a} to within 0.1~mag.\nWe combine this uncertainty in quadrature with 0.19~mag to obtain\nthe value we adopt for the absolute surface magnitude of the secondary:\n$\\mathcal{M_{\\rm V}}=-36.72\\pm0.21$.\n\nThe apparent $V$-band magnitude of {NovaMus}\\ is $19.85\\pm0.05$ in 2009;\ncorrecting for the disk contribution $(56.7\\pm1.4)\\%$, the magnitude of\nthe secondary alone is $m_{\\rm V}=20.76\\pm0.06$.  Next, we correct for\nreddening, relying on two observations of the 2200~\\AA\\ dust feature in\nthe ultraviolet spectrum of {NovaMus}.  \\citet{cheng+1992} reported\n$E(B-V)=0.287\\pm0.004$ based on observations made using the Faint Object\nSpectrograph (FOS) onboard the {\\it Hubble Space Telescope}, while\n\\citet{shrader+1993} obtained a consistent result, $E(B-V)=0.30\\pm0.05$\nbased on observations made using the {\\it International Ultraviolet\n  Explorer}.  We take $E(B-V)=0.29\\pm0.05$, adopting the larger error \nbar to cover the uncertainty in\nconverting $E(B-V)$ to $A_{\\rm V}$ using the standard extinction law:\n$A_V=R(V)\\times E(B-V)$ with $R(V)=3.1$ \\citep{cardelli+1989}.  We\ntherefore conclude that the reddening of {NovaMus}\\ is $A_{\\rm\n  V}=0.90\\pm0.16$ and the dereddened $V$-band magnitude of the secondary\nis $m_{\\rm V_0}=19.86\\pm0.17$.\n\nThe distance $D$ can then be obtained from the equation \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n5\\log(D/R_2)=m_{\\rm V_0}-\\mathcal{M_{\\rm V}}=56.58\\pm0.27,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $R_2=1.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}\\ R_\\odot$ is the\nradius of the secondary (\\S\\ref{model:fit}).  We therefore conclude that\nthe distance of {NovaMus}\\ is $D=4.95^{+0.69}_{-0.65}$~kpc.  This value is\nconsistent with most literature estimates, which are generally based on\nthe methodology we employ; e.g., $5.1$~kpc \\citep{gelino+2001},\n$5.0\\pm1.0$~kpc \\citep{esin+1997}, $5.5\\pm1.0$~kpc \\citep{orosz+1996},\nand $>4$~kpc \\citep{king+1996}.  Using NIR photometric data, while\nignoring the disk contribution, \\citet{shahbaz+1997} obtained a lower\nestimate of $D=2.8$--4.0~kpc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Summary \\& Discussion}\\label{discuss}\n\nCombining the various results presented herein with those in\n\\citetalias{wu+2015b}, we have obtained three principal results:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item We present the first evidence that BHSXTs brighten gradually and\n  steadily between outburst cycles.  For {NovaMus}, SMARTS data show the\n  rate to be $0.0357\\pm0.0006$~mag~yr$^{-1}$ in the $V$-band and\n  $0.0199\\pm0.0004$~mag~yr$^{-1}$ in the $I$-band for the period 2003 to\n  2015 (sans 2010). Between the time {NovaMus}\\ returned to quiescence\n  following its 1991 outburst and today, the total brightening in the\n  $V$-band is $\\approx0.8$~mag.  This result provides support for the\n  disk instability model and the work of\n  \\citet{cantrell+2008,cantrell+2010} on optical states and state\n  changes.  It also underscores the importance of obtaining light\n  curve data early in the quiescent phase for use in constraining the\n  systemic inclination via ellipsoidal modeling. \n\\item By modeling three archival optical/NIR light curves of the highest\n  quality using the ELC code, we determined the systemic inclination\n  of {NovaMus}\\ to be $i=43.2^{+2.1}_{-2.7}$ deg.  Our measured value of the\n  black hole mass is $M=11.0^{+2.1}_{-1.4}\\ M_\\odot$, while the mass of the\n  secondary is $M_2=0.89^{+0.18}_{-0.11}\\ M_\\odot$.\n\\item Based on our determination of the radius of the secondary,\n  $R_2=1.06^{+0.07}_{-0.04}~R_\\odot$, we estimate the distance of {NovaMus}\\\n  to be $D=4.95^{+0.69}_{-0.65}$~kpc.  We will use this estimate of $D$,\n  along with our estimates of $i$ and $M$, archival X-ray data, and the\n  continuum-fitting method to estimate the spin of the black hole, a\n  result that will be presented in a companion paper (Chen et al. 2015).\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nAmong transient X-ray sources, the black hole mass in {NovaMus}\\ is high,\ndeviating by $\\sim3\\sigma$ from the narrowly-distributed mass\ndistribution of BHSXTs centered at $7.8\\pm1.2\\ M_\\odot$\n\\citep{ozel+2010,farr+2011,mcclintock+2014}.  The two rivals are the\nblack holes in GRS~1915$+$105 \\citep[$M=12.4^{+2.0}_{-1.8}\\\nM_\\odot$;][]{reid+2014} and in GS~2023+338 \\citep[$M=12 \\pm 2\nM_\\odot$;][but see \\citealt{khargharia+2010}]{charles+2006}.  The general lack of\nmassive black holes among BHSXTs can be explained by the evolutionary\npaths of low-mass {\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ binaries during which the star loses\nsubstantial mass before the supernova explosion \\citep{ozel+2010}.  The\nblack hole in {NovaMus}\\ may be spinning relatively rapidly as the result of\naccretion torques, if the black hole's birth mass is significantly less\nthan the current mass \\citep{fragos+2015}.\n\nWe note three lessons learned for future attempts to obtain robust\nmeasurements of the masses of black holes in BHSXTs based on our results\nand on the results of earlier studies\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{cantrell+2008,cantrell+2010,kreidberg+2012}: 1) perform\nthe spectroscopic and photometric monitoring observations simultaneously\nin order to accurately correct for disk emission; 2) use only\npassive-state light curve data for which the non-stellar emission is\nfree of strong flickering and can be well-modeled by a steady disk\ncomponent plus a hotspot component; and 3) obtain optical monitoring\ndata soon after the system returns to quiescence, when the disk emission\nis minimal.\n\nConcerning the first of the three points -- the need for simultaneity --\nthis is particularly important for short-period systems because the disk\ncomponent is often dominant. Furthermore, as an inspection of\nFig.~\\ref{smarts_fig} makes clear, this component not only varies\nfrom season to season, but it varies on much shorter\ntimescales as well.  The key methodology we employed was insuring that\nour spectroscopic and photometric data were obtained strictly\nsimultaneously.  Although the $V$-band light curve we obtained in 2009\nwas unsuitable for ellipsoidal modeling because the system was in the\nactive state, we were nevertheless able to use it (and the spectroscopic\ndata) to very precisely constrain the disk fraction for our selected\narchival light curves (\\S\\ref{lc:veil}).\n\nIn closing, we comment briefly on ellipsoidal studies of short-period\nBHSXTs by other groups (see also\n\\citealt{kreidberg+2012}). \\citet{cantrell+2010} obtained robust\nestimates of $i$ and $M$ for A0620$-$00 using nearly simultaneous\nspectroscopic and photometric data to constrain the disk fraction. \n \\citet{khargharia+2013} likewise obtained\nhigh-quality constraints on $i$ and $M$ for XTE~J1118$+$480 based on NIR\nphotometry and spectroscopy performed on the same night.  GS~2000$+$25\nappears to be a very favorable system; the disk fraction is minimal, and\nthe orbital modulation almost purely ellipsoidal. However,\n\\citet{ioannou+2004} report relatively weak constraints on $i$ and $M$\nbecause the disk fraction and the mass ratio $q$ were poorly\nconstrained.  For XTE~J1859$+$226, \\citet{corral+2011} obtained\npassive-state light curves, but their disk fraction is poorly\nconstrained because two years elapsed between their photometric and\nspectroscopic observations.  The light curves of GRO~J0422$+$32 are\nalways observed to be dominated by aperiodic flickering;\n\\citet{reynolds+2007} conclude that attempts to constrain the mass of\nthe black hole are ``prone to considerable uncertainty'' because of the\ncontaminating effects of disk emission.  In conclusion, one must be\ncautious of masses published for short-period BHSXTs based on\nnon-simultaneous photometry and spectroscopy, and doubly cautious of\nstudies that ignore the disk emission altogether\n\\citep[e.g.][]{gelino+2003}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nWe thank D.~Steeghs, P.~Longa-Pe\\~{n}a, P.~J.~Callanan, L.~C.~Ho,\nP.~G.~Jonker, M.~T.~Reynolds, and M.~A.~P.~Torres for their\ncontributions to this work, which are reported in \n\\citetalias{wu+2015b}.

We present the first clear\n  evidence that the brightening of soft X-ray transients in quiescence\n  occurs at a nearly linear rate. This discovery, and our precise\n  determination of the disk component of emission obtained using our\n  {\\it simultaneous} photometric and spectroscopic data, have allowed us\n  to identify and accurately model archival ellipsoidal light curves of\n  the highest quality.  The simultaneity, and the strong constraint it\n  provides on the component of disk emission, is a key element of our\n  work. Based on our analysis of the light curves, and our earlier\n  measurements of the mass function and mass ratio, we have obtained for\n  Nova Muscae 1991 the first accurate estimates of its systemic\n  inclination $i=43.2^{+2.1}_{-2.7}$ deg, and black hole mass \n  $M=11.0^{+2.1}_{-1.4}\\ M_\\odot$.  Based on our determination of the\n  radius of the secondary, we estimate the distance to be\n  $D=4.95^{+0.69}_{-0.65}$~kpc.  We discuss the implications of our work\n  for future dynamical studies of black-hole soft {\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ transients.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{black hole physics --- stars: black holes --- binaries:\n  general --- X-rays: binaries}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{intro}\n\nStellar-mass black holes are identified and studied in {\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ binary\nsystems in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies \\citep{remillard+2006}. The\ncompact objects in two dozen of these systems are dynamically confirmed\nto be black holes with masses in the range $M=5$--30$~M_\\odot$ \\citep[for\nthe most recent review, see][]{casares+2014}. One remarkable property of\nthe mass distribution of these black holes is the ``mass gap'', i.e.,\nthe lack of black holes with $M=3-5~M_\\odot$\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{ozel+2010,farr+2011}.  Assuming that this mass gap is\nnot caused by selection biases \\citep[e.g.,][]{narayan+2005}, it\nprovides an important constraint on supernova models\n\\citep{fryer+2001,belczynski+2012,kochanek+2014}.  \n\nMass measurements, along with estimates of distance $D$ and systemic\ninclination $i$, have also made possible demonstrably reliable\nmeasurements of the spins of ten black holes via the continuum-fitting\nmethod (\\citealt{mcclintock+2014}, and references therein).  In turn,\nthese spin measurements benefit a variety of astrophysical\nstudies. For example, they are the basis for a correlation between jet\npower and black hole spin\n(\\citealt{narayan+2012,steiner+2013,mcclintock+2014}; but also see \n\\citealt{fender+2010,russell+2013}), which provides insights into the\nenergy generation mechanism of relativistic jets \\citep{narayan+2014}.\nIn testing this correlation and its associated jet model, it is\nessential to increase the sample size, which is presently only five\nblack-hole soft X-ray transients (which we refer to hereafter as\nBHSXTs). Especially important for the correlation is a single\nshort-period BHSXT, A0620-00 ($P=7.8$~hr), which anchors the correlation\nat low spin and low jet power. In this paper, we report estimates of\n$M$, $i$ and $D$ for Nova Muscae 1991 (GS/GRS 1124$-$683; hereafter\n{NovaMus}), another short-period BHSXT ($P=10.4$~hr), which is very similar\nin many respects to A0620-00 \\citep{remillard+1992}. The compact primary\nof {NovaMus}\\ was dynamically confirmed to be a black hole shortly after its\ndiscovery by \\citet{remillard+1992}.  Using our values of $M$, $i$ and $D$\nfor {NovaMus}, we will go on to estimate the black hole's spin (Chen et\nal. 2015) and test the jet model of \\citet{narayan+2012} by\ncomparing our spin estimate to the value predicted in\n\\citet{steiner+2013}. \n\nIn measuring the mass of a black hole in an {\\hbox{X-ray}}\\ binary, one must\ndetermine three parameters: 1) the value of the mass function $f(M)$,\nwhich sets a hard lower limit on the mass of the compact object; 2) the\nratio of the mass of the secondary star to that of the black hole, $q\n\\equiv M_2/M$; and 3) the orbital inclination angle $i$ of the \nsystem. The first two parameters are usually obtained via spectroscopy\nin the optical or near-infrared (NIR) band.  The value of the mass\nfunction is determined by the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity\ncurve of the secondary $K_2$ and the orbital period $P$:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nf(M) \\equiv \\frac{{P}K_{2}^{3}}{2\\pi G} = \\frac{M\\sin^3i}{(1+q)^{2}}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f(M)\\equiv\\frac{{P}K_{2}^{3}}{2\\pi G}=\\frac{M\\sin^{3}i}{(1+q)^{2}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2261</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>K</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
