(This is so called ``alpha-rich freeze-out.\")\n\\cite{1998ApJ...498..808M} showed that the abundances in such materials are well described by the quasi-statistical equilibrium (QSE) abundances, which minimize the free energy in the system under the constraint that the total number of heavy-nuclei (the nuclei except neutron, proton, and alpha-particle) is fixed.\n\nTaking the study into account, we set our goal in this paper as formulating the nucleosynthesis in high-entropy and fast-expanding materials using the abundance in a special case of QSE where alpha-particles and nucleons are not in equilibrium.\nWe call the special QSE the {\\it alpha-constrained QSE ($\\alpha$QSE)}.\nIn the following, we call the abundance in the $\\alpha$QSE the $\\alpha$QSE abundance, and the nucleosynthesis via the $\\alpha$QSE abundance the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\nIn Section 2, we formulate the $\\alpha$QSE abundance and show distributions in some cases.\nIn Section 3, we compare the $\\alpha$QSE abundance and the abundance dynamically calculated with nuclear reaction network, and discuss the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\nThen, in Section 4, we show the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis indeed occurs in the HN wind, and discuss the points different from the nucleosynthesis in the NDW in the ordinary SNe.\nFinally discussion and conclusion are given in Sections 5 and 6, respectively.\n\n\\section{Theory of $\\alpha$QSE}\nIn this section we derive the abundance distribution where the alpha particle abundance deviates from its equilibrium value and the abundance distribution of heavy-nuclei is still under the reaction equilibrium.\nWe call the abundance as ``$\\alpha$QSE abundance\" and compare to the results of network calculations in the following section.\n\n\\subsection{Framework}\nWe consider a system in the equilibrium at a temperature $T$, a density $\\rho$, and an electron fraction $Y_e$.\nThe abundance distribution in equilibrium under such a condition is determined so that the free energy of the system, $f$, is minimized under the abundance.\nThus, we solve the abundances of the nuclei such that the free energy is stationary under any infinitesimal deviations of the abundance $Y_i$ of the nuclear species $i$, or,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ndf = \\sum_{i} \\mu_i dY_i = 0,\\label{eq1}\n\\end{equation}\n",

condition of the minimum free energy, i.e., the conservation of mass, the charge neutrality, the fixed abundances of heavy-nuclei $Y_h$.\nIn order to obtain the $\\alpha$QSE abundances, we must add the fourth constraint, that the alpha particle abundance $Y_\\alpha$ is fixed.\nUsing the fourth constraint, the above constraints can be reduced to three equations

i.e., $\\rho$, $T$, $Y_e$, $Y_h$, and $Y_\\alpha$.\nDetails for the derivation of the $\\alpha$QSE abundance are given in Appendix \\ref{app:a}.\n\n\\subsection{The $\\alpha$QSE Abundance Distribution}\nHere we show the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution in some cases.\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:S140_T5_ye0.50_ya0.98}, we show the abundance as a function of the mass-number in the nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE), the normal QSE \\citep[formulated in][]{1998ApJ...498..808M}, and the $\\alpha$QSE of $T_9=T/(10^9\\ {\\rm K})=5$, $\\rho_5=\\rho/(10^5{\\rm g\\ cm^{-3}}) \\approx2$ (corresponding to the situation of the entropy per baryon $s/k_{\\rm B}=140$), and $Y_e=0.50$.\nWe see that the NSE abundance (the green-dashed line) peaks at iron-group nuclei.\nIn calculating the normal QSE abundance, we set the heavy-element abundance $Y_h=0.1 Y_{h,{\\rm NSE}}$, where $Y_{h,{\\rm NSE}}$ is the heavy-element abundance in the NSE of the same $T$, $\\rho$, and $Y_e$.\nWe see that the abundance pattern does not change drastically.\n\nRegarding the $\\alpha$QSE abundance (the red-solid line), we use the values $Y_h=0.1 Y_{h,{\\rm NSE}}$ and $Y_\\alpha=0.98 Y_{\\alpha,{\\rm QSE}}$, where $Y_{\\alpha,{\\rm QSE}}$ is the alpha particle abundance in the normal QSE.\nThe abundance pattern drastically changes from the NSE and the normal QSE, and another peak appears at higher mass-number ($A\\sim 90$, the $N=50$ magic nuclei).\nThe only 2\\% lack of $Y_\\alpha$ for its normal QSE value also raises the abundances of protons and neutrons to $Y_p^{\\rm \\alpha QSE}\\approx 6.9 \\times10^{-3}$ and $Y_n^{\\rm \\alpha QSE}\\approx 1.4 \\times10^{-3}$, which is 2.4 and 2.6 times larger than those of the normal QSE.\nThe increase of free nucleons makes the abundance distribution in the reaction equilibrium shift to higher mass-number.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f01.eps}\n\\caption{\nAbundance distributions in the NSE (green-dashed

$Y_h=0.1 Y_{h,{\\rm NSE}}$.\nFor the $\\alpha$QSE, we set the same $Y_h$ as the normal QSE, and set $Y_\\alpha=0.98 Y_{\\alpha,{\\rm QSE}}$.\n}\n\\label{fig:S140_T5_ye0.50_ya0.98}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn

(a) corresponds to the normal QSE.\nThe peaks in cases (a), (b), and (c) correspond to the iron-peak nuclei, $N=50$ magic nuclei, and $Z=50$ magic nuclei, respectively.\nThe peaks for cases (d), (e), and (f) indicate the locations of the $N=82$ magic number, stable nuclei due to small deformation, and $Z=82$, $N=126$ magic numbers.\nWe see that, with sufficiently low $Y_\\alpha$, the nuclei of $A\\sim 200$ can be produced in the $\\alpha$QSE.\n\nBriefly we discuss the dependence of the $\\alpha$QSE abundance on the other parameters.\nIf we set lower $Y_h$ fixing the other parameters, the abundance peak shifts to the higher mass-number.\nThis is because the number of nucleons per heavy nucleus gets larger.\nIf we set higher entropy, the abundance peak appears at smaller-mass-number since, at the same temperature, the density and nucleon-capture reaction rates get smaller.\nNormally, the larger $Y_e$ is, the smaller the peak-mass-number becomes, because adding a proton to a nucleus releases less energy than adding a neutron.\nThe responses of the average mass-number of the distribution to the change of parameters are given in Appendix \\ref{app:b}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f02.eps}\n\\caption{\n$\\alpha$QSE abundance patterns for $Y_\\alpha/Y_{\\alpha,{\\rm QSE}}=$1.00, 0.98, 0.94, 0.85, 0.70,

Nucleosynthesis}\nIn the previous section, we see that, if the alpha particle abundance $Y_\\alpha$ lacks for the value in equilibrium with nucleons, large-mass-number nuclei can be produced in the $\\alpha$QSE distribution.\n\nThere are two causes by which the alpha particle abundance deviates from its equilibrium value.\nOne is high entropy.\nThe high entropy decreases the abundances of light nuclei such as $^2$H, $^3$H, and $^3$He, which are well in equilibrium with free nucleons \\citep[as mentioned in][]{2002PhRvL..89w1101M}.\nAt a high temperature ($T_9\\gtrsim5$), alpha particles are produced mainly from these light nuclei, so in the high entropy environment, the reaction flow to alpha particle cannot get large enough to maintain the alpha particles in equilibrium with the nucleons.\nThe other is fast expansion.\nAt a low temperature, the production of alpha particles occurs via catalysis of heavy nuclei \\citep[][]{2002PhRvL..89w1101M}, and the fast expansion (with high entropy) prevents the the production of heavy nuclei via triple-alpha reactions.\n\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE abundance would appear in a high-entropy and fast-expanding material.\nIn this section we compare the network calculation on a simple model of expanding material to the $\\alpha$QSE abundances, and discuss the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\n\n\\subsection{The Expansion Model and Nucleosynthesis Calculation}\nIn order to investigate the $\\alpha$QSE condition, we employ the simple model of spherically symmetric, homogeneous, and adiabatic expansion with a

Nucleosynthesis}\nIn the previous section, we see that, if the alpha particle abundance $Y_\\alpha$ lacks for the value in equilibrium with nucleons, large-mass-number nuclei can be produced in the $\\alpha$QSE distribution.\n\nThere are two causes by which the alpha particle abundance deviates from its equilibrium value.\nOne is high entropy.\nThe high entropy decreases the abundances of light nuclei such as $^2$H, $^3$H, and $^3$He, which are well in equilibrium with free nucleons \\citep[as mentioned in][]{2002PhRvL..89w1101M}.\nAt a high temperature ($T_9\\gtrsim5$), alpha particles are produced mainly from these light nuclei, so in the high entropy environment, the reaction flow to alpha particle cannot get large enough to maintain the alpha particles in equilibrium with the nucleons.\nThe other is fast expansion.\nAt a low temperature, the production of alpha particles occurs via catalysis of heavy nuclei \\citep[][]{2002PhRvL..89w1101M}, and the fast expansion (with high entropy) prevents the the production of heavy nuclei via triple-alpha reactions.\n\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE abundance would appear in a high-entropy and fast-expanding material.\nIn this section we compare the network calculation on a simple model of expanding material to the $\\alpha$QSE abundances, and discuss the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\n\n\\subsection{The Expansion Model and Nucleosynthesis Calculation}\nIn order to investigate the $\\alpha$QSE condition, we employ the simple model of spherically symmetric, homogeneous, and adiabatic expansion with a constant velocity.\nThe time-evolution of the density is\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\rho(t) = \\rho_0(1+t/\\tau_{\\rm exp})^{-3},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math

respectively.\n}\n\\label{fig:Ye0.50_helm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe closely investigate nucleosynthesis of some expansions in Figure \\ref{fig:Ye0.50_helm}.\nFirst, we focus on the low-entropy expansion with $s=153$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=4.07$ ms (case A in this figure), in which $\\left<A\\right> <60$.\nWe show two snapshots of the abundance distribution (hereafter we call ``the network abundance distribution\") in the nuclear chart at $T_9\\approx$ 5.5 (Top) and 5.4 (Bottom) in Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00213_00053_00075}.\nAt $T_9\\approx 6.1$, the abundance of alpha particles becomes smaller than its equilibrium value.\nThen, the abundance distribution starts to shift from the normal QSE to the $\\alpha$QSE one.\nTherefore, the distribution concentrates around $N=50$ magic nuclei in Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00213_00053_00075}-(1).\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00213_00053}, we show the $\\alpha$QSE abundance in the same environment, i.e., at the same $T$, $\\rho$, $Y_e$, $Y_h$, and $Y_\\alpha$ as the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00213_00053_00075}.\nThe $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution is the distribution to which the abundance tends to evolve, because the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution is the one that minimizes the free energy under the given constraints.\nWe see that the network distribution, especially in large-$A$ region, is well described by the $\\alpha$QSE distribution.\n\nIn order to see the extent of the $\\alpha$QSE cluster in the network calculation, we define a combination\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr(Z,A) = \\frac{Y_{\\rm network}(Z,A)/Y_{\\rm network}(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})}{Y_{\\rm \\alpha QSE}(Z,A)/Y_{\\rm \\alpha QSE}(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})$ indicates the the most abundant nucleus in the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution.\nIf the value of $r(Z,A)$ is near the unity, it can be said that the nucleus $(Z,A)$ and $(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})$ are in the same $\\alpha$QSE cluster.\nIn the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00213_00053}, we show the extent of $\\alpha$QSE cluster at $T_9\\approx 5.5$, where the nuclei whose values of $r$ are between 0.1-10 are shown in yellow, indicating they are nearly in $\\alpha$QSE with the nucleus $(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})$.\nFrom this figure, we see that the nuclei around $N=50$ magic nuclei are indeed in the $\\alpha$QSE.\n\nHowever, at $T_9\\approx 5.4$, in the network calculation, the heavy-nuclei of $A \\sim 90$ are all photo-disintegrated.\nThis is because, in this expansion, a lot of iron-group nuclei are supplied via triple-alpha reactions.\nThen the reaction cycles, ${}^{58}{\\rm Fe}(n,\\gamma){}^{59}{\\rm Fe}(p,n){}^{59}{\\rm Co}(n,\\gamma){}^{60}{\\rm Co}(p,n){}^{60}{\\rm Ni}(n,\\gamma){}^{61}{\\rm Ni}$\\\\$(n,\\alpha){}^{58}{\\rm Fe}$ for example, supply alpha particles and bring $Y_\\alpha$ to its equilibrium value.\nTherefore, the heavy-nuclei ($A \\sim 90$) in the $\\alpha$QSE are photo-disintegrated and finally, the normal QSE, where iron-group nuclei are most abundant for $Y_e=0.5$, is achieved.\nAs the result, the final abundance peaks at iron-group nuclei as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:lastya_00216_00213}.\n\n\nFrom the above discussion, we conclude that the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis, i.e., the freeze-out of the $\\alpha$QSE abundance, is the production of less heavy-nuclei not to produce alpha particle sufficiently.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f04.eps}\n\\caption{\nSnapshots

abundance distributions of the case A (red line) and case B (blue line).\n}\n\\label{fig:lastya_00216_00213}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNext, we focus on the high-entropy expansion with $s=254$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=4.07$ ms (``case B\" in Figure \\ref{fig:Ye0.50_helm}), in which $\\left<A\\right> =159$.\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}, we show two snapshots of the abundance distributions at $T_9 \\approx$ 4.9 (Top) and 3.1 (Bottom) in the expansion.\nIn this case, the abundance of alpha particles starts to deviate from its normal QSE value at $T_9\\approx 6.5$ and the abundance distribution starts to evolve to the $\\alpha$QSE one.\nAt $T_9\\approx 4.9$ (Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}-(1)), the nuclei around $N=82$ magic nuclei are indeed in the $\\alpha$QSE.\nBelow this temperature, the abundance distribution concentrates in the neutron-rich region, as we see in Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}-(2), where the distribution of the network calculation at $T_9\\approx 3.1$ is shown.\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00216_00083}, we show the $\\alpha$QSE abundance in the same environment as Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}-(2).\nWe see that the $\\alpha$QSE abundance, to which the network abundance tends to evolve, is concentrated in very-large mass-number nuclei (around double magic nucleus of $(Z,N)=(82,126)$ and even larger).\nTherefore, the neutron-rich network abundance is the transitional abundance toward the $\\alpha$QSE one.\nSince they cannot catch-up with the $\\alpha$QSE distribution to the end, after the phase, the distribution freezes-out.\nThe final abundance is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:lastya_00216_00213}.\nWe see that the elements of $A\\sim 200$ are synthesized in this nucleosynthesis process.\n\n\\cite{2002PhRvL..89w1101M} first pointed out that this nucleosynthesis occurs in the fast-expanding material.\nWe make it clear that, although it does not proceed via the $\\alpha$QSE abundance, the nucleosynthesis process can be understood as the transient phase toward the $\\alpha$QSE abundance.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f07.eps}\n\\caption{\nSnapshots of the abundance distribution in the expansion with $s=254$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=4.07$ ms.\nThe temperatures of each snapshots are $T_9\\approx 4.9$ and 3.1, respectively.\n}\n\\label{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f08.eps}\n\\caption{\n$\\alpha$QSE abundance in the same environment as the Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}-(2).\n}\n\\label{fig:qse_clstr_00216_00083}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe show the case where the initial electron fraction is $Y_e=0.53$ in the nucleosynthesis calculations in Figure \\ref{fig:0.53}.\nWe see that the parameter region where the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis occurs becomes smaller than that in the case $Y_e=0.50$.\nIn the case of higher electron fraction, the abundance distribution of the iron-group is concentrated in more proton-rich region.\n\nIn expansions with the same $s$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}$, increasing $Y_e$ from 0.50 to 0.53 increases the average proton number in the iron-group nuclei by $0.5-1$ at the same temperature.\nThen the reaction cycle which mainly supply alpha particles changes to more proton-rich side, e.g., ${}^{56}{\\rm Fe}(p,\\gamma){}^{57}{\\rm Co}(p,\\gamma){}^{58}{\\rm Ni}(n,\\gamma){}^{59}{\\rm Ni}(n,\\alpha){}^{56}{\\rm Fe}$.\nIn general, the cross sections of $(n,\\alpha)$ reactions, which supply alpha particles, are large for proton-rich nuclei.\nOn the other hand, in this high temperature ($T_9\\sim 5-6$), the increasing $Y_e$ at the beginning of the calculation changes the neutron abundance only by a factor.\nTherefore, increasing $Y_e$ enhances the alpha particle production via $(n,\\alpha)$ reactions of proton-rich iron-group nuclei.\nThus, satisfying the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis becomes more difficult in the proton-rich material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n

Nucleosynthesis in HN Wind}\n\\subsection{Comparison of the Network Abundance in HN Wind to the $\\alpha$QSE Abundance}\nHere we compare the results of the nucleosynthesis calculation of the HN wind with the $\\alpha$QSE abundance.\nWe construct the spherically symmetric, steady solution of the NDW using parameter set in the first line of Table \\ref{tab:modelpar}.\nThey are parameters of the HN wind used in \\cite{2015ApJ...810..115F}.\nThen, we perform the nucleosynthesis calculation on the constructed wind solution.\nNow we include the (anti)neutrino-absorption reactions of nucleons.\nThe methods of construction of the wind and the nucleosynthesis calculation are summarized in \\cite{2015ApJ...810..115F}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[htbp]\n\\caption{The Parameters of the HN Wind and the

abundance in the same environment in Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00007_00054}.\nFrom the snapshot of the abundance distribution at $T_9\\approx 5.4$ in our network calculation (top panel), we see that heavy-nuclei are concentrated in the region near the stable line and $N=50-82$ and $Z=35-55$.\nThis trend is well described by the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution with the same parameter set of $Y_e$, $Y_h$, and $Y_\\alpha$ (middle panel).\nIn the bottom panel, we show the extent of the $\\alpha$QSE cluster.\nWe see that most nuclei in the region of $N=50-82$ and $Z=35-55$ are indeed in $\\alpha$QSE cluster.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f10.eps}\n\\caption{\nTop: Snapshot of the abundance distribution at $T_9\\approx 5.4$ in our network

at $T_9\\approx2.8$ in Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00007_00120}.\nAt this temperature, the network result shows proton-rich distribution in $N=50-82$ region (see top panel).\nThe $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution (middle panel) shows the same trend.\nTherefore, the trends of the network abundance can be expressed by the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution in the same environment.\nAfter this, the reaction rates of heavy-nuclei decrease and the nuclear abundance freezes-out.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f11.eps}\n\\caption{\nSame figure as Figure

distribution of the HN wind.\nWe see that the nuclei of $A\\sim 110-140$ are mainly produced by $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\nThe bottom panel shows the production factors of the final products.\nThe $p$-nuclei of $A\\sim 110-140$ are main products.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f12.eps}\n\\caption{\nTop: Final abundance distributions of the HN wind (red-solid line) and the ordinary SN wind (blue-dashed line).\nThe thin-dashed line indicates the result of the HN wind without neutrino-interactions.\nBottom: Production factors of the HN wind.\n}\n\\label{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{The Effects of Neutrinos}\nHere we discuss the effects of neutrinos on the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\nIn the proton-rich condition, anti-electron neutrinos supply neutrons via $p+\\bar{\\nu}_e\\rightarrow n+e^+$ reactions.\nNeutrons are easily absorbed by heavy-nuclei.\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution is maintained for a longer time because photo-disintegrations are prevented by neutron-absorption reactions.\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}, we also show the result for the nucleosynthesis calculation without neutrino interactions on the same background as the HN wind model (thin-dashed line).\nWe see that the nuclei of $A>120$ are photo-disintegrated to the nuclei of $A=100-120$.\nIn the absence of neutrons, these heavy-nuclei cannot exist against photo-disintegrations.\nTherefore, the neutrino-interactions indeed maintain the $\\alpha$QSE abundance.\n\n\\subsection{Differences between the NDW in SNe and HNe}\nHere we discuss the differences of the nucleosynthesis between the ordinary SN wind and the HN wind.\nWe construct the solution of the NDW in the ordinary SN in the same way as the HN, but we use the parameter set in the second line of Table \\ref{tab:modelpar}.\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}, we show the final abundance distribution of the ordinary SN wind (blue line).\nFrom this figure, we see that only nuclei up to iron-group are produced in the ordinary SN wind.\n\nThe difference between final abundance distributions in the ordinary SN and the HN winds is caused by the differences in the relation between the expansion rate and the reaction rates in the winds.\nWe show the average rates of individual reactions per nucleus in the nuclei of $A\\ge 12$ in the ordinary SN wind in the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:f1} \\citep[for the definition of these rates, see Section 4 in][]{2015ApJ...810..115F}.\nIn the same figure, we also show the rates of reactions which produce alpha particles (pink-solid line), and reactions which produce $^{12}{\\rm C}$ from alpha particles, i.e., the triple-alpha and ${}^{4}{\\rm He}(\\alpha n,\\gamma){}^{9}{\\rm Be}(\\alpha,n){}^{12}{\\rm C}$ reactions (light-blue-solid line).\nNote that the rates of their inverse reactions are shown in dashed lines.\n\nWe see that, throughout the calculation, the rates of $^{12}$C-production and decomposition reactions are below the temperature-decreasing rate $\\tau_T^{-1} = T^{-1}dT/d\\tau$.\nIn this situation, alpha particles are not consumed and remain after the temperature decreases.\nThis is called ``alpha-rich freeze-out.\"\nIn addition, until the temperature deceases to $4.5\\times 10^9\\ {\\rm K}$, the production and decomposition rates of alpha particles are larger than the temperature-decreasing rate and the both rates are almost the same.\nThis indicates that the alpha particles are in equilibrium with nucleons until $4.5\\times 10^9\\ {\\rm K}$.\nNote that the rates of $(n,\\gamma)$, $(p,\\gamma)$, and $(n,p)$ and their inverse reactions are almost the same and much larger than the temperature-decreasing rate.\nTherefore, the normal QSE abundance, formulated in \\cite{1998ApJ...498..808M}, is in good agreement with the network abundance.\nIn this case, since $Y_e$ is near 0.5, the normal QSE abundance peaks around iron-group nuclei.\nAs a result, after the abundance freezes-out, the iron-peak remains as shown in the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}.\n\nIn the case of the HN wind (Bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:f1}), however, the reaction rates of alpha particles get smaller than the temperature-decreasing rate at $\\sim 6\\times 10^9\\ {\\rm K}$.\nBelow this temperature, the abundance of alpha particles cannot catch-up with and deviates from its equilibrium value.\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis indeed occurs in the HN wind.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{minipage}{\\hsize}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f13.eps}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{\nTop: Time evolution of the average reaction rates per nucleus in the heavy-nuclei of  $A\\ge12$ in the trajectory of the ordinary SN wind.\nBottom: Same figure as the top panel, but in the case of the HN wind.\nThe rates of $(n,\\gamma)$, $(p,\\gamma)$, $(n,p)$ reactions are shown in green, red, and blue-solid lines, respectively, and their inverse reaction rates are shown in dashed lines.\nThe temperature-decreasing rate $\\tau_T^{-1}$ is shown in the black-dashed line.\n}\n\\label{fig:f1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{discussion}\n\\subsection{Production of $p$-nuclei}\nAs shown in Section 3, the $\\alpha$QSE abundance is concentrated in proton-rich region at low temperature.\nAs a result, as seen in the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}, $p$-nuclei of $A=110-140$ are mainly produced.\nHeavy $p$-nuclei of $A=110-125$ are underproduced in the $\\gamma$-process so, if the electron fraction of the wind is near 0.5, this HN wind model may be a possible site for the production of these $p$-nuclei.\n\nSuch an investigation with smaller parameter range was performed in \\cite{2004ApJ...617L.131J}.\nThey pointed out that free neutrons are important for this $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis because they keep the abundance distribution in a high-mass one.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, because of the large neutrino luminosities, a lot of neutrons are supplied by $p+\\bar{\\nu}_e\\rightarrow n+e^+$ reactions in the HN wind.\nThus the $p$-nuclei production through the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would indeed occur in the HN wind.\n\n\\subsection{Application to Other Astrophysical Phenomena}\nIn the previous sections, we show that the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis occurs in the sufficiently high-entropy and the sufficiently fast-expanding material.\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur not only in HN winds but also some other phenomena which eject the material in such environment.\n\nA high entropy would be achieved in the material in the jet in gamma-ray-bursts (GRBs) but, when we consider a fireball, the entropy per baryon required for the terminal Lorentz factor to be $\\sim 100$ is $\\sim 10^5 k_{\\rm B}$.\nIt is too large to make heavy-elements during the expansion, like big-bang nucleosynthesis \\citep{2003ApJ...588..931B}.\n\nHowever, as mentioned in \\cite{2003ApJ...595..294I}, in connection with GRBs, moderately baryon-rich material would be ejected as ``circum-jet outflow\" around the collimated jet.\nThere would be the outflows of ``failed-GRB\" events, when the activity of the central engine is weak or the baryon-loading process occurs more efficiently.\nIf the outflows are proton-rich, as we show in this paper, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur in the material.\n\nIn the center of super-massive star (SMS), the mass of which is $\\sim 10^5M_\\odot$, the entropy would be 100-200.\nOne example is a 55,500 $M_\\odot$ star in \\cite{2014ApJ...790..162C}.\nAlthough this star explodes as a thermonuclear SN by the explosive He burning, the central entropy becomes $\\sim 200$ at the maximum central temperature.\nTherefore, if the explosion occurs when the SMS collapses and the temperature of the ejecta rapidly decreases from $\\sim 10^{10}$ K, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur in the material.\n\n\\subsection{Electron Fraction in the Material}\nThe $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis, proposed in this paper, occurs in slightly proton-rich ($Y_e\\gtrsim 0.5$) material.\nIn the material of $Y_e<0.5$, with such a high entropy and a high expansion velocity, the $r$-process will occur and the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution will not achieved.\nIf the elemental abundance pattern of $\\alpha$QSE is discovered in some metal-poor stars, it would constrain the electron fraction of the ejecta of HNe and GRBs, which reflects the circumstance and mechanism of them.\n\n\\section{conclusions}\nIn this work, we investigate the nucleosynthesis in a high-entropy and fast-expanding material where the alpha particle abundance becomes below the value in equilibrium with nucleons.\nWe construct the equilibrium abundance distribution in such an expansion, ``$\\alpha$QSE,\" which minimizes the free energy under four constraints: the charge neutrality, the numbers of baryons, heavy nuclei, and alpha particles.\nWe show that the nucleosynthesis of the NDWs in HNe can be understood as the freeze-out of the $\\alpha$QSE abundances.\nWe also investigate the dependence of the entropy $s$ and the expansion timescale $\\tau_{\\rm exp}$ on the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis, using a simple expansion model.\nWe show that the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur not only in the NDW in HNe but also in the material with such high entropy and high expansion velocity.\nWe conclude that the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis is that the less production of heavy-nuclei which are catalyses for the supply of alpha particles.\n\n\\acknowledgements\nWe thank Takashi Nakamura, Takahiro Tanaka, and Masaru Shibata for fruitful discussions.\nS.F. is supported by Research Fellowship of Japan Society for the Promotion

of the formulation of the $\\alpha$QSE abundance.\nThe $\\alpha$QSE abundance minimizes the free energy (i.e., Equation \\ref{eq1}) under the constraints of Equations (\\ref{eq3})-(\\ref{eq5}).\nWe obtain such an abundance using the method of Lagrange multiplier.\nWe find the abundance for that the function\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15666, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\rho_0=\\rho(t=0)$ is the initial mass density and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=r_0/v_0$ is the expansion timescale ($r_0$ and $v_0$ is the initial radius of the material and the expansion velocity).\n\nWe use the equation of state by \\cite{2000ApJS..126..501T} to obtain the entropy as the function of $\\rho$, $T$, and $Y_e$, which includes the entropy of nucleons, electrons, positrons and photons.\nThe temperature at a time $t$ is obtained using $\\rho(t)$ with the condition for the constant entropy.\n\nUsing the above expansion model, we perform the nucleosynthesis calculation.\nWe use the same nuclear reaction network

effects of which will be discussed in the following section.\n\nParameters which determine the final abundance pattern are the entropy $s$, the expansion timescale $\\tau_{\\rm exp}$, and the electron

are convenient for investigating the dependence of the average mass-number of heavy-elements on the parameters.\nFirst, we consider the response to the change of $Y_\\alpha$.\nTaking the derivative of the constraints (\\ref{eq3})-(\\ref{eq5}) with respect to $Y_\\alpha$, we obtain \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n-2 &=& Y_p \\frac{\\partial \\ln Y_p}{\\partial Y_\\alpha} + \\sum_{i\\neq n,p,\\alpha} Z_i

exp})=(153,4.07\\ {\\rm ms})$ and $(254,4.07\\ {\\rm ms})$, respectively.\n}\n\\label{fig:Ye0.50_helm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe closely investigate nucleosynthesis of some expansions in Figure \\ref{fig:Ye0.50_helm}.\nFirst, we focus on the low-entropy expansion with $s=153$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=4.07$ ms (case A in this figure), in which $\\left<A\\right> <60$.\nWe show two snapshots of the abundance distribution (hereafter we call ``the network abundance distribution\") in the nuclear chart at $T_9\\approx$ 5.5 (Top) and 5.4 (Bottom) in Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00213_00053_00075}.\nAt $T_9\\approx 6.1$, the abundance of alpha particles becomes smaller than its equilibrium value.\nThen, the abundance distribution starts to shift from the normal QSE to the $\\alpha$QSE one.\nTherefore, the distribution concentrates around $N=50$ magic nuclei in Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00213_00053_00075}-(1).\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00213_00053}, we show the $\\alpha$QSE abundance in the same environment, i.e., at the same $T$, $\\rho$, $Y_e$, $Y_h$, and $Y_\\alpha$ as the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00213_00053_00075}.\nThe $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution is the distribution to which the abundance tends to evolve, because the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution is the one that minimizes the free energy under the given constraints.\nWe see that the network distribution, especially in large-$A$ region, is well described by the $\\alpha$QSE distribution.\n\nIn order to see the extent of the $\\alpha$QSE cluster in the network calculation, we define a combination\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr(Z,A) = \\frac{Y_{\\rm network}(Z,A)/Y_{\\rm network}(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})}{Y_{\\rm \\alpha QSE}(Z,A)/Y_{\\rm \\alpha QSE}(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})$ indicates the the most abundant nucleus in the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution.\nIf the value of $r(Z,A)$ is near the unity, it can be said that the nucleus $(Z,A)$ and $(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})$ are in the same $\\alpha$QSE cluster.\nIn the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00213_00053}, we show the extent of $\\alpha$QSE cluster at $T_9\\approx 5.5$, where the nuclei whose values of $r$ are between 0.1-10 are shown in yellow, indicating they are nearly in $\\alpha$QSE with the nucleus $(Z_{\\rm peak},A_{\\rm peak})$.\nFrom this figure, we see that the nuclei around $N=50$ magic nuclei are indeed in the $\\alpha$QSE.\n\nHowever, at $T_9\\approx 5.4$, in the network calculation, the heavy-nuclei of $A \\sim 90$ are all photo-disintegrated.\nThis is because, in this expansion, a lot of iron-group nuclei are supplied via triple-alpha reactions.\nThen the reaction cycles, ${}^{58}{\\rm Fe}(n,\\gamma){}^{59}{\\rm Fe}(p,n){}^{59}{\\rm Co}(n,\\gamma){}^{60}{\\rm Co}(p,n){}^{60}{\\rm Ni}(n,\\gamma){}^{61}{\\rm Ni}$\\\\$(n,\\alpha){}^{58}{\\rm Fe}$ for example, supply alpha particles and bring $Y_\\alpha$ to its equilibrium value.\nTherefore, the heavy-nuclei ($A \\sim 90$) in the $\\alpha$QSE are photo-disintegrated and finally, the normal QSE, where iron-group nuclei are most abundant for $Y_e=0.5$, is achieved.\nAs the result, the final abundance peaks at iron-group nuclei as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:lastya_00216_00213}.\n\n\nFrom the above discussion, we conclude that the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis, i.e., the freeze-out of the $\\alpha$QSE abundance, is the production of less heavy-nuclei not to produce alpha particle sufficiently.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f04.eps}\n\\caption{\nSnapshots of the abundance distribution in the expansion with $s=153$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=4.07$ ms,

and case B (blue line).\n}\n\\label{fig:lastya_00216_00213}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNext, we focus on the high-entropy expansion with $s=254$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=4.07$ ms (``case B\" in Figure \\ref{fig:Ye0.50_helm}), in which $\\left<A\\right> =159$.\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}, we show two snapshots of the abundance distributions at $T_9 \\approx$ 4.9 (Top) and 3.1 (Bottom) in the expansion.\nIn this case, the abundance of alpha particles starts to deviate from its normal QSE value at $T_9\\approx 6.5$ and the abundance distribution starts to evolve to the $\\alpha$QSE one.\nAt $T_9\\approx 4.9$ (Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}-(1)), the nuclei around $N=82$ magic nuclei are indeed in the $\\alpha$QSE.\nBelow this temperature, the abundance distribution concentrates in the neutron-rich region, as we see in Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}-(2), where the distribution of the network calculation at $T_9\\approx 3.1$ is shown.\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00216_00083}, we show the $\\alpha$QSE abundance in the same environment as Figure \\ref{fig:cmp_00216_00052_00083}-(2).\nWe see that the $\\alpha$QSE abundance, to which the network abundance tends to evolve, is concentrated in very-large mass-number nuclei (around double magic nucleus of $(Z,N)=(82,126)$ and even larger).\nTherefore, the neutron-rich network abundance is the transitional abundance toward the $\\alpha$QSE one.\nSince they cannot catch-up with the $\\alpha$QSE distribution to the end, after the phase, the distribution freezes-out.\nThe final abundance is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:lastya_00216_00213}.\nWe see that the elements of $A\\sim 200$ are synthesized in this nucleosynthesis process.\n\n\\cite{2002PhRvL..89w1101M} first pointed out that this nucleosynthesis occurs in the fast-expanding material.\nWe make it clear that, although it does not proceed via the $\\alpha$QSE abundance, the nucleosynthesis process can be understood as the transient phase toward the $\\alpha$QSE abundance.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f07.eps}\n\\caption{\nSnapshots of the abundance distribution in the expansion with $s=254$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}=4.07$ ms.\nThe temperatures of each snapshots are $T_9\\approx 4.9$ and 3.1,

calculations in Figure \\ref{fig:0.53}.\nWe see that the parameter region where the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis occurs becomes smaller than that in the case $Y_e=0.50$.\nIn the case of higher electron fraction, the abundance distribution of the iron-group is concentrated in more proton-rich region.\n\nIn expansions with the same $s$ and $\\tau_{\\rm exp}$, increasing $Y_e$ from 0.50 to 0.53 increases the average proton number in the iron-group nuclei by $0.5-1$ at the same temperature.\nThen the reaction cycle which mainly supply alpha particles changes to more proton-rich side, e.g., ${}^{56}{\\rm Fe}(p,\\gamma){}^{57}{\\rm Co}(p,\\gamma){}^{58}{\\rm Ni}(n,\\gamma){}^{59}{\\rm Ni}(n,\\alpha){}^{56}{\\rm Fe}$.\nIn general, the cross sections of $(n,\\alpha)$ reactions, which supply alpha particles, are large for proton-rich nuclei.\nOn the other hand, in this high temperature ($T_9\\sim 5-6$), the increasing $Y_e$ at the beginning of the calculation changes the neutron abundance only by a factor.\nTherefore, increasing $Y_e$ enhances the alpha particle production via $(n,\\alpha)$ reactions of proton-rich iron-group nuclei.\nThus, satisfying the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis becomes more difficult in the proton-rich material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n   \\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f09.eps}\n\\caption{\nSame figure as Figure

HN Wind to the $\\alpha$QSE Abundance}\nHere we compare the results of the nucleosynthesis calculation of the HN wind with the $\\alpha$QSE abundance.\nWe construct the spherically symmetric, steady solution of the NDW using parameter set in the first line of Table \\ref{tab:modelpar}.\nThey are parameters of the HN wind used in \\cite{2015ApJ...810..115F}.\nThen, we perform the nucleosynthesis calculation on the constructed wind solution.\nNow we include the (anti)neutrino-absorption reactions of nucleons.\nThe methods of construction of the wind and the nucleosynthesis calculation are summarized in \\cite{2015ApJ...810..115F}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[htbp]\n\\caption{The Parameters of the HN Wind and the Ordinary SN

abundance in the same environment in Figure \\ref{fig:qse_clstr_00007_00054}.\nFrom the snapshot of the abundance distribution at $T_9\\approx 5.4$ in our network calculation (top panel), we see that heavy-nuclei are concentrated in the region near the stable line and $N=50-82$ and $Z=35-55$.\nThis trend is well described by the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution with the same parameter set of $Y_e$, $Y_h$, and $Y_\\alpha$ (middle panel).\nIn the bottom panel, we show the extent of the $\\alpha$QSE cluster.\nWe see that most nuclei in the region of $N=50-82$ and $Z=35-55$ are indeed in $\\alpha$QSE cluster.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f10.eps}\n\\caption{\nTop: Snapshot of the abundance distribution at $T_9\\approx 5.4$ in our network

distribution (middle panel) shows the same trend.\nTherefore, the trends of the network abundance can be expressed by the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution in the same environment.\nAfter this, the reaction rates of heavy-nuclei decrease and the nuclear abundance freezes-out.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f11.eps}\n\\caption{\nSame figure as Figure

distribution of the HN wind.\nWe see that the nuclei of $A\\sim 110-140$ are mainly produced by $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\nThe bottom panel shows the production factors of the final products.\nThe $p$-nuclei of $A\\sim 110-140$ are main products.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f12.eps}\n\\caption{\nTop: Final abundance distributions of the HN wind (red-solid line) and

wind.\n}\n\\label{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{The Effects of Neutrinos}\nHere we discuss the effects of neutrinos on the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis.\nIn the proton-rich condition, anti-electron neutrinos supply neutrons via $p+\\bar{\\nu}_e\\rightarrow n+e^+$ reactions.\nNeutrons are easily absorbed by heavy-nuclei.\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution is maintained for a longer time because photo-disintegrations are prevented by neutron-absorption reactions.\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}, we also show the result for the nucleosynthesis calculation without neutrino interactions on the same background as the HN wind model (thin-dashed line).\nWe see that the nuclei of $A>120$ are photo-disintegrated to the nuclei of $A=100-120$.\nIn the absence of neutrons, these heavy-nuclei cannot exist against photo-disintegrations.\nTherefore, the neutrino-interactions indeed maintain the $\\alpha$QSE abundance.\n\n\\subsection{Differences between the NDW in SNe and HNe}\nHere we discuss the differences of the nucleosynthesis between the ordinary SN wind and the HN wind.\nWe construct the solution of the NDW in the ordinary SN in the same way as the HN, but we use the parameter set in the second line of Table \\ref{tab:modelpar}.\n\nIn the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}, we show the final abundance distribution of the ordinary SN wind (blue line).\nFrom this figure, we see that only nuclei up to iron-group are produced in the ordinary SN wind.\n\nThe difference between final abundance distributions in the ordinary SN and the HN winds is caused by the differences in the relation between the expansion rate and the reaction rates in the winds.\nWe show the average rates of individual reactions per nucleus in the nuclei of $A\\ge 12$ in the ordinary SN wind in the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:f1} \\citep[for the definition of these rates, see Section 4 in][]{2015ApJ...810..115F}.\nIn the same figure, we also show the rates of reactions which produce alpha particles (pink-solid line), and reactions which produce $^{12}{\\rm C}$ from alpha particles, i.e., the triple-alpha and ${}^{4}{\\rm He}(\\alpha n,\\gamma){}^{9}{\\rm Be}(\\alpha,n){}^{12}{\\rm C}$ reactions (light-blue-solid line).\nNote that the rates of their inverse reactions are shown in dashed lines.\n\nWe see that, throughout the calculation, the rates of $^{12}$C-production and decomposition reactions are below the temperature-decreasing rate $\\tau_T^{-1} = T^{-1}dT/d\\tau$.\nIn this situation, alpha particles are not consumed and remain after the temperature decreases.\nThis is called ``alpha-rich freeze-out.\"\nIn addition, until the temperature deceases to $4.5\\times 10^9\\ {\\rm K}$, the production and decomposition rates of alpha particles are larger than the temperature-decreasing rate and the both rates are almost the same.\nThis indicates that the alpha particles are in equilibrium with nucleons until $4.5\\times 10^9\\ {\\rm K}$.\nNote that the rates of $(n,\\gamma)$, $(p,\\gamma)$, and $(n,p)$ and their inverse reactions are almost the same and much larger than the temperature-decreasing rate.\nTherefore, the normal QSE abundance, formulated in \\cite{1998ApJ...498..808M}, is in good agreement with the network abundance.\nIn this case, since $Y_e$ is near 0.5, the normal QSE abundance peaks around iron-group nuclei.\nAs a result, after the abundance freezes-out, the iron-peak remains as shown in the top panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}.\n\nIn the case of the HN wind (Bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:f1}), however, the reaction rates of alpha particles get smaller than the temperature-decreasing rate at $\\sim 6\\times 10^9\\ {\\rm K}$.\nBelow this temperature, the abundance of alpha particles cannot catch-up with and deviates from its equilibrium value.\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis indeed occurs in the HN wind.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{minipage}{\\hsize}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{f13.eps}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{\nTop: Time evolution of the average reaction rates per nucleus in the heavy-nuclei of  $A\\ge12$ in the trajectory of the ordinary SN wind.\nBottom: Same figure as the top panel, but in the case of the HN wind.\nThe rates of $(n,\\gamma)$, $(p,\\gamma)$, $(n,p)$ reactions are shown in green, red, and blue-solid lines, respectively, and their inverse reaction rates are shown in dashed lines.\nThe temperature-decreasing rate $\\tau_T^{-1}$ is shown in the black-dashed line.\n}\n\\label{fig:f1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{discussion}\n\\subsection{Production of $p$-nuclei}\nAs shown in Section 3, the $\\alpha$QSE abundance is concentrated in proton-rich region at low temperature.\nAs a result, as seen in the bottom panel of Figure \\ref{fig:prodfctr_ya_00007}, $p$-nuclei of $A=110-140$ are mainly produced.\nHeavy $p$-nuclei of $A=110-125$ are underproduced in the $\\gamma$-process so, if the electron fraction of the wind is near 0.5, this HN wind model may be a possible site for the production of these $p$-nuclei.\n\nSuch an investigation with smaller parameter range was performed in \\cite{2004ApJ...617L.131J}.\nThey pointed out that free neutrons are important for this $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis because they keep the abundance distribution in a high-mass one.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, because of the large neutrino luminosities, a lot of neutrons are supplied by $p+\\bar{\\nu}_e\\rightarrow n+e^+$ reactions in the HN wind.\nThus the $p$-nuclei production through the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would indeed occur in the HN wind.\n\n\\subsection{Application to Other Astrophysical Phenomena}\nIn the previous sections, we show that the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis occurs in the sufficiently high-entropy and the sufficiently fast-expanding material.\nTherefore, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur not only in HN winds but also some other phenomena which eject the material in such environment.\n\nA high entropy would be achieved in the material in the jet in gamma-ray-bursts (GRBs) but, when we consider a fireball, the entropy per baryon required for the terminal Lorentz factor to be $\\sim 100$ is $\\sim 10^5 k_{\\rm B}$.\nIt is too large to make heavy-elements during the expansion, like big-bang nucleosynthesis \\citep{2003ApJ...588..931B}.\n\nHowever, as mentioned in \\cite{2003ApJ...595..294I}, in connection with GRBs, moderately baryon-rich material would be ejected as ``circum-jet outflow\" around the collimated jet.\nThere would be the outflows of ``failed-GRB\" events, when the activity of the central engine is weak or the baryon-loading process occurs more efficiently.\nIf the outflows are proton-rich, as we show in this paper, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur in the material.\n\nIn the center of super-massive star (SMS), the mass of which is $\\sim 10^5M_\\odot$, the entropy would be 100-200.\nOne example is a 55,500 $M_\\odot$ star in \\cite{2014ApJ...790..162C}.\nAlthough this star explodes as a thermonuclear SN by the explosive He burning, the central entropy becomes $\\sim 200$ at the maximum central temperature.\nTherefore, if the explosion occurs when the SMS collapses and the temperature of the ejecta rapidly decreases from $\\sim 10^{10}$ K, the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur in the material.\n\n\\subsection{Electron Fraction in the Material}\nThe $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis, proposed in this paper, occurs in slightly proton-rich ($Y_e\\gtrsim 0.5$) material.\nIn the material of $Y_e<0.5$, with such a high entropy and a high expansion velocity, the $r$-process will occur and the $\\alpha$QSE abundance distribution will not achieved.\nIf the elemental abundance pattern of $\\alpha$QSE is discovered in some metal-poor stars, it would constrain the electron fraction of the ejecta of HNe and GRBs, which reflects the circumstance and mechanism of them.\n\n\\section{conclusions}\nIn this work, we investigate the nucleosynthesis in a high-entropy and fast-expanding material where the alpha particle abundance becomes below the value in equilibrium with nucleons.\nWe construct the equilibrium abundance distribution in such an expansion, ``$\\alpha$QSE,\" which minimizes the free energy under four constraints: the charge neutrality, the numbers of baryons, heavy nuclei, and alpha particles.\nWe show that the nucleosynthesis of the NDWs in HNe can be understood as the freeze-out of the $\\alpha$QSE abundances.\nWe also investigate the dependence of the entropy $s$ and the expansion timescale $\\tau_{\\rm exp}$ on the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis, using a simple expansion model.\nWe show that the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis would occur not only in the NDW in HNe but also in the material with such high entropy and high expansion velocity.\nWe conclude that the condition for the $\\alpha$QSE nucleosynthesis is that the less production of heavy-nuclei which are catalyses for the supply of alpha particles.\n\n\\acknowledgements\nWe thank Takashi Nakamura, Takahiro Tanaka, and Masaru Shibata for fruitful discussions.\nS.F. is supported by Research Fellowship of Japan Society for the Promotion

correlates in the $N$-$Z$ plane.\nIn our case, $\\sigma_{ZN}^2$ is positive because the abundance distribution generally shows the positive correlation on the chart of nuclides.\nThese variants
