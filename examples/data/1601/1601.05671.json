However, the existence of a clear-cut\ntransition between a solid-like and liquid-like behaviour is currently\nstrongly challenged \\cite{Nichol2010,\n  Reddy2011,Nguyen2011,Amon2012}. In the presence of a shear band\n(i.e. a fluid zone dwelling somewhere in the packing) different\nauthors brought evidences for mechanically activated creeping\nprocesses taking place in remote regions, below the Coulomb\nthreshold\\cite{Nichol2010, Reddy2011}. This behaviour led to non-local\nrheological relations proposed to extend the standard local\nconstitutive relations for granular flows \\cite{Henann2013,\n  Bouzid2013,Henann2014, Bouzid2015}. For granular packing sheared in\nall of its parts below the Coulomb limit, dynamical processes leading\nto a logarithmic creep occurs \\cite{Schmertmann1991,\n  Nguyen2011,Amon2012}. Interestingly, this creeping dynamics can be\nmapped onto a simple visco-elastic model initially designed to render\nthe phenomenology of yield stress fluids displaying ageing in the\nsolid phase \\cite{Derec2001}. The model is centred on a dynamical\nequation for a fluidity parameter representing an effective\nvisco-elastic relaxation. This phenomenological parameter was directly\nrelated to the occurrence of mesoscopic plastic events called ''hot\nspots'' \\cite{Amon2012}. In the vicinity of the dynamical threshold,\nthese events combine to provide large scale plastic yields\n\\cite{Amon2012, LeBouil2014}. Recently, we have shown that providing a\ntiny stress modulation around a nominal shear stress, the creep\ndynamics changes from a logarithmic to a linear behaviour\n\\cite{Pons2015}. The physical interpretation stems from the\ncombination of memory effects and non-linearities, leading to a\n''secular'' accumulation of tiny effects, meaning that the creep\ndynamics is revealed at a time scale much larger than the\nmodulation. We call this behaviour \\emph{``rectified creep''} in the\nfollowing as the interpretation of this regime is different from an\nEyring-like activated process. As the ingredients at the origin of\nthis rectified creep are generic for a large class of soft glassy\nmaterials, this effect should be seen in other yield stress fluids\ndisplaying\ncreep~\\cite{Moller2009,Marchal2009,Negi2010,Siebenburger2012}.\n\nIn this paper, using a spatially resolved multiple scattering\ntechnique \\cite{Erpelding2008}, we monitor the spatial distribution of\nhot-spots during the two creep regimes. In parallel, a spatially\nresolved visco-elastic model is solved assuming a direct relation\nbetween the hot-spots production rate and the local fluidity\nvalue. The numerical solution is compared to the\nexperiments. Interpretation of the results in the framework of a local\nrheological model is provided.\n\t\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htbp]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{1_set-up}}\n\\caption{ (a) Experimental set-up: shear is imposed by an hanging mass\n  $m$ connected to the vertical axis; vertical displacement of the\n  water reservoir allows modulation of the applied stress; a camera\n  collects backscattered light from a He-Ne laser illuminating the top\n  of the shear cell.

It\nconsists in a cylindrical shear cell (Radius $R=5cm$, height $H=10cm$)\nfilled with glass beads of density $\\rho=2500\\ kg/m^3$ and mean\ndiameter $d=200\\ \\mu m$ (rms polydispersity $\\Delta d= 30\\ \\mu m$). A\nwell defined packing fraction $\\Phi = 0.605\\pm0.005$ is obtaining\nusing an air fluidized bed as described by Nguyen et\nal. \\cite{Nguyen2011}.\n\nShear is obtained by applying a torque on a stainless steel four-blade\nvane (radius $R_0 =1.27\\ cm$, height $H_0 =2.54\\ cm$) via a mass $m$\nsuspended from a pulley (see fig.~\\ref{fig.setup}a). Using this\n``Atwood-machine\" technique, mechanical noise inherently coming from\nany motorized process can be suppressed.  The mass $m$ hangs partially\ninside a reservoir filled with water. Thus, by modulating the\nArchimedes force, through the up and down motion of the reservoir\nsitting on a vertical translation stage, controlled modulation of the\ntorque applied to the granular packing can be obtained.\nA torque probe connected to the vane axis measures the applied torque\n$T$. The vane rotation angle $\\alpha$ is monitored via a transverse\narm whose displacement is measured by an induction probe. Torque and\ndisplacement signals as well as the vertical translation stage command\nare connected to a Labview controller board. We defined here the mean\nstress and the mean strain as $\\sigma_0=\\frac{T}{2\\pi R_0^2H_0}$ and\n$\\gamma=\\frac{\\alpha R_0}{R-R_0}$ respectively.\n\nFor a given experiment, the protocol (fig.~\\ref{fig.setup}c) is the\nfollowing $(i)$ stress ramp at constant stress rate ($\\dot{\\sigma} =5\n\\ Pa/s$) up to the desired mean stress value $\\sigma_0$; $(ii)$\nconstant shear $\\sigma_0$ applied during $t_w=1500\\ s$; $(iii)$\nmodulation of the stress around $\\sigma_0$ for at least 2 hours. The\nmodulation consist in triangular oscillations with an amplitude\n$\\delta$ and a frequency $f_\\sigma$. We introduce the modulation\nstress rate, $R_\\sigma=4\\delta f_\\sigma$ to characterize the\nmodulation. \n\nLet us note that we used the same set-up and protocol than\n\\cite{Pons2015} and results presented here include those already\npresented. The two following points differs from the former study.\n\nHere, two vane penetration depths were used : $h=5\\ cm$ and\n$0\\ cm$. During the vane insertion procedure, in order to prevent\nlarge scale disturbances in the packing, pressurized air is gently\nflown, just below the fluidization threshold providing a packing at\nthe surface bearing almost no confining pressure. In addition, after\nthe introduction of the vane, we kept the air flowing during 10 min in\norder to relax the remaining stress perturbations induced by the vane\ninsertion. The air flow is switched off before the start of the\nexperiment. For experiments performed with the vane near the surface\n($h=0\\ cm$), the grains are confined with a glass plate in order to\nobtain a confining pressure at the top of the vane close to the one\nexisting for experiments done at the insertion height $h=5\\ cm$. The\ncircular glass plate has a central hole to let the vane shaft go\nthrough and the vertical confinement pressure was adjusted by placing\nloads on the glass plate.\n\nIn addition to the mechanical measurements, we obtain, by diffusive\nwave spectroscopy (DWS) \\cite{Erpelding2008,Erpelding2010,Amon2012}, a\nspatially resolved map of the top surface deformations. DWS is an\ninterference technique using scattering of coherent light by strongly\ndiffusive materials. In our case, a He-Ne laser ($\\lambda=633\\ nm$)\nilluminates the top of the shear cell. A camera imaging the surface at\na frame rate of 0.1 Hz collects back-scattered light\n(fig.~\\ref{fig.setup}a). The correlation of scattered intensities\nbetween two successive images, $g_I$, is computed by zones of 16\n$\\times$ 16 pixels, composing correlation maps of 370 $\\mu m$\nresolution.  The link between the value of $g_I$ and the corresponding\ndeformations that have occurred inside the sample were extensively\ndescribed in \\cite{Erpelding2008,Erpelding2010}. Maximal correlation\n($g_I>0.99$, white on Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}a) corresponds to an\nhomogeneous deformation below $10^{-7}$ and vanishing correlation\n(black on Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}a) corresponds to deformations larger than\n$10^{-5}$.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Experimental results} \n\nFigure~\\ref{fig.setup}.b shows typical deformations for two\nexperiments performed at the same mean stress ($\\sigma_0 = 1100 Pa$)\nand oscillation amplitude ($\\delta = 7.5Pa$) for two oscillation\nfrequencies. These two experiments were performed at a penetration\ndepth $h=5cm$.  During the phase at constant stress, we observe a slow\nincrease of the deformation, $\\gamma(t)$, similar for both\nexperiments. This initial dynamics can be fitted by a logarithmic\ncurve as in \\cite{Nguyen2011}.  Then, when submitted to oscillations,\nthe system transits to a linear creep regime characterized by a\nconstant mean strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_\\infty $, which increases\nwith the oscillation frequency. This sub-threshold fluidization by\nmechanical perturbation has been already reported and interpreted\nin~\\cite{Pons2015} as a secular drift\nprocess. Figure~\\ref{fig.setup}.d shows the value of the steady state\nstrain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_\\infty $, for all the experiments performed\nat $h=5cm$ and at various $\\sigma_0$ and $R_\\sigma=4\\delta\nf_\\sigma$. Though the data are dispersed, $\\dot{\\gamma}_\\infty $\nclearly increases with $\\sigma_0$ and $R_\\sigma$ as predicted by\n\\cite{Pons2015} as long as $\\sigma_0$ is below $\\sim1500Pa$. For\nhigher stresses, $\\dot{\\gamma}_\\infty $ keeps increasing with\n$\\sigma_0$ but the influence of $R_\\sigma$ remains unclear. For these\nstress values around the stress dynamical threshold (see\n\\cite{Nguyen2011}), the mean shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_\\infty$ indeed\nbecomes very large, however the experiments display a great amount of\nsensitivity to preparation, which makes measurements in this limit\nquite difficult.\n\nSeveral experiments performed at either $h=0$ or $5\\ cm$ were coupled\nto the DWS technique. Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}a represents a typical map of\nthe top surface deformation: in average, the correlation, $g_I$, is\nlarger than 0.99 (white) implying a low and homogeneous deformation\nexcept over small areas (black spots), called ``hot spots\"\nin~\\cite{Amon2012}, which are characterized by relatively large\nplastic deformations. Figures~\\ref{fig.DWS}b-d show the mean strain,\n$\\gamma(t)$ and the cumulative number of ``hot spots\", $N_{c}(t)$,\nover the surface of interest, $S$, as a function of time for three\nexperiments performed at the same mean stress, $\\sigma_0=1000Pa$. For\nthe experiment shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}c no modulation is performed\nunlike the ones shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}b and d. Experiments b and\nd differ in the depth of the vane, respectively $h=5\\ cm$ and\n$h=0\\ cm$. One can note that the ``hot-spots\" are present at the top\nsurface even when the vane is buried inside the packing\n(fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}b) which indicates that the localized relaxation\nprocess is spreading over the whole material.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{2_Results_DWS_fusion}}\n\\caption{(a) Typical correlation map of the top surface.

When the stress modulation is turned on, we also obtain,\nafter a transient regime, a proportional relationship between\n$N_{c}(t)$ and $\\gamma(t)$ but with a smaller slope.  This\nproportionnality shows that the macroscopic plastic deformation is the\nresult of the accumulation of local plastic events. The coefficient of\nproportionality depends thus on the value of $h$ but also on the\nregimes (relaxation or rectified-regime). For the latter, the\n``hot-spots\" production rate inducing similar plastic deformations\nwhen compared to the relaxation-regime values, is significantly\nsmaller (Fig.~\\ref{fig.NG}a). The change of the slope is visible in\nboth experiments at $h=0$ and $5\\ cm$. Finally, two experiments with\nstress modulation for each depth are superimposed, showing the\nreproducibility of the measurements.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{3_N-VS-Gamma_fusion}}\n\\caption{Normalized cumulative number of hot-spots as a function of\n  the mean strain for 5 different experiments performed at\n  $\\sigma_0=1000Pa$.

This system of equations\ncan then be solved numerically to reproduce the experimental\nprotocol. In presence of stress modulation, the resulting plastic\ndeformation exhibits a transient logarithmic response followed by a\nlinear regime (Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}f). As we established before~\\cite{Pons2015}, this is\nqualitatively what is observed experimentally. The model allows thus\nto recover the general experimental behaviour as far as global\ndeformation is concerned. \n\nSeveral works have shown experimentally a direct relation between the\nrate of plastic events and the fluidity variable\n$f$~\\cite{Amon2012,Jop2012}. However, it is not clear a priori that\nthe mechanical driving would generate the same modes of plastic\nrelaxation in the packing in the presence of the mechanical\nperturbations. And indeed, in fig.~\\ref{fig.NG}a, one can identify a\nsystematic change of slope for the relation between the cumulated\nnumber of ''hot-spots'' and the mean strain in the presence of stress\nmodulation. This experimental fact leads to a central question on the\nrelation between the rate of ``hot spots\" production and the fluidity\nparameter. This is the central object of the incoming discuccion.\n\n\\section{Spatial response}\nProvided the assumption of a constant linear relationship between the\nrate of hot-spots production and the fluidity, the local and global\ndistribution of hot-spot events can be computed. First, the radial\nheterogeneity of the stress field is taken into account in the model,\ni.e. $\\sigma(r) = \\sigma(R_0) R_0^2/r^2$. However, here we do not\naccount for the vertical heterogeneities as for example would be the\ncase for experiments with the vane buried.\n\nEqs.~(\\ref{eq.fluidity1bis}) and~(\\ref{eq.fluidity2bis}) are then\nintegrated numerically for each $r$ giving local values of the\nfluidity $f(r)$ and strain $\\gamma(r)$. Because of the cylindrical\ngeometry, the total rate of hot-spots occurrence is then expected to\nbe proportional to $\\int_{R_0}^R f(r)r dr$. The cumulated number of\nspot $N_c(t)$ can then be obtained numerically (within a\nmultiplicative constant) by integrating this rate over time: $N_{c}(t)\n= \\int_0^t \\int_{R_0}^R f(\\tau,r)r d\\tau dr $. In parallel,\n$\\gamma(r)$ is integrated over $r$ in order to obtain the rotation\nangle $\\alpha(t)$ of the vane. Thus we can obtained numerically the\nmean strain $\\gamma(t)=\\alpha(t) R_0/(R-R_0)$ corresponding to the one\nexperimentally measured. Those two quantities are compared to the\ndimensionless time in Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}e-f. In the case of\nFig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}e no stress modulation is considered and we recover\nthe behaviour of the model when no spatial dependence is taken into\naccount~\\cite{Nguyen2011,Amon2012}. In the case of\nFig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}f, stress modulation are imposed from $t=0$ and in\nthis last case we observe a change of creep regime after a transient\nregime, in agreement with the experimental graphs of\nFig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}b and d. Finally, Fig.~\\ref{fig.NG}b shows the\nrelationship between $N_{c}(t)$ and $\\gamma(t)$ obtained numerically\nin each case. This relationship is the same as the one observed in\nexperiments: the integral of the fluidity is proportional to the\nplastic deformation and for the rectified creep, a strong reduction of\nthe slope is observed when the transient is terminated.\n\nTherefore, the outcome of the simulations is qualitatively very\nsimilar to the experimental results. In particular, the change of\nslope in Fig.~\\ref{fig.NG}a is reproduced in the rheological model\nwhen the heterogeneity of the stress field due to the geometry is\ntaken into account.  Microscopically, this reduction originates from a\ndifference in spatial distribution of ``hot spots\" for the two cases\nas we show numerically and experimentally in\nFig.~\\ref{fig.geometry_effect}. Fig.~\\ref{fig.geometry_effect}a\n(resp. b) shows the radial evolution of the fluidity parameter without\n(resp. with) stress modulation at different time of the numerical\nintegration. For the simple relaxation regime (logarithmic creep), the\nfluidity is quite homogeneous across the cell and thus rather\nindependent of the local stress.

This system of equations\ncan then be solved numerically to reproduce the experimental\nprotocol. In presence of stress modulation, the resulting plastic\ndeformation exhibits a transient logarithmic response followed by a\nlinear regime (Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}f). As we established before~\\cite{Pons2015}, this is\nqualitatively what is observed experimentally. The model allows thus\nto recover the general experimental behaviour as far as global\ndeformation is concerned. \n\nSeveral works have shown experimentally a direct relation between the\nrate of plastic events and the fluidity variable\n$f$~\\cite{Amon2012,Jop2012}. However, it is not clear a priori that\nthe mechanical driving would generate the same modes of plastic\nrelaxation in the packing in the presence of the mechanical\nperturbations. And indeed, in fig.~\\ref{fig.NG}a, one can identify a\nsystematic change of slope for the relation between the cumulated\nnumber of ''hot-spots'' and the mean strain in the presence of stress\nmodulation. This experimental fact leads to a central question on the\nrelation between the rate of ``hot spots\" production and the fluidity\nparameter. This is the central object of the incoming discuccion.\n\n\\section{Spatial response}\nProvided the assumption of a constant linear relationship between the\nrate of hot-spots production and the fluidity, the local and global\ndistribution of hot-spot events can be computed. First, the radial\nheterogeneity of the stress field is taken into account in the model,\ni.e. $\\sigma(r) = \\sigma(R_0) R_0^2/r^2$. However, here we do not\naccount for the vertical heterogeneities as for example would be the\ncase for experiments with the vane buried.\n\nEqs.~(\\ref{eq.fluidity1bis}) and~(\\ref{eq.fluidity2bis}) are then\nintegrated numerically for each $r$ giving local values of the\nfluidity $f(r)$ and strain $\\gamma(r)$. Because of the cylindrical\ngeometry, the total rate of hot-spots occurrence is then expected to\nbe proportional to $\\int_{R_0}^R f(r)r dr$. The cumulated number of\nspot $N_c(t)$ can then be obtained numerically (within a\nmultiplicative constant) by integrating this rate over time: $N_{c}(t)\n= \\int_0^t \\int_{R_0}^R f(\\tau,r)r d\\tau dr $. In parallel,\n$\\gamma(r)$ is integrated over $r$ in order to obtain the rotation\nangle $\\alpha(t)$ of the vane. Thus we can obtained numerically the\nmean strain $\\gamma(t)=\\alpha(t) R_0/(R-R_0)$ corresponding to the one\nexperimentally measured. Those two quantities are compared to the\ndimensionless time in Fig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}e-f. In the case of\nFig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}e no stress modulation is considered and we recover\nthe behaviour of the model when no spatial dependence is taken into\naccount~\\cite{Nguyen2011,Amon2012}. In the case of\nFig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}f, stress modulation are imposed from $t=0$ and in\nthis last case we observe a change of creep regime after a transient\nregime, in agreement with the experimental graphs of\nFig.~\\ref{fig.DWS}b and d. Finally, Fig.~\\ref{fig.NG}b shows the\nrelationship between $N_{c}(t)$ and $\\gamma(t)$ obtained numerically\nin each case. This relationship is the same as the one observed in\nexperiments: the integral of the fluidity is proportional to the\nplastic deformation and for the rectified creep, a strong reduction of\nthe slope is observed when the transient is terminated.\n\nTherefore, the outcome of the simulations is qualitatively very\nsimilar to the experimental results. In particular, the change of\nslope in Fig.~\\ref{fig.NG}a is reproduced in the rheological model\nwhen the heterogeneity of the stress field due to the geometry is\ntaken into account.  Microscopically, this reduction originates from a\ndifference in spatial distribution of ``hot spots\" for the two cases\nas we show numerically and experimentally in\nFig.~\\ref{fig.geometry_effect}. Fig.~\\ref{fig.geometry_effect}a\n(resp. b) shows the radial evolution of the fluidity parameter without\n(resp. with) stress modulation at different time of the numerical\nintegration. For the simple relaxation regime (logarithmic creep), the\nfluidity is quite homogeneous across the cell and thus rather\nindependent of the local stress. The fluidity decreases uniformly with\ntime, reflecting the decrease of the strain rate. On the contrary, for\nthe rectified regime (Fig.~\\ref{fig.geometry_effect}b), the fluidity\nis quite different close or further away from the centre. It reaches\nrapidly a permanent regime with a high density value close to the\ncentre while far from it, the density behaviour is close to the one\nobserved without modulation.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{5_Radial_Density}\n\\caption{(a-b) Numerical resolution of\n  eq.~(\\ref{eq.fluidity1bis}-\\ref{eq.fluidity2bis}) taking into\n  account the geometry of the system: evolution of the radial spatial\n  fluidity over time whitout and with stress modulation,\n  respectively.

Indeed, the time\nfor the transient to reach the stationary solution $f^*$ is typically\n$1/f^*$ which diverges when the targeted fluidity decreases. Actually,\nthe distinction between a rectified creep of very small $f^*$ and a\nlogarithmic creep could be pointless experimentally. The time to reach\nthe stationary solution may become increasingly long while\nenvironmental background noise, always presents in practice, may\neventually hinder the latter.\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn this report, we studied the creep response of a granular packing\nbelow the Coulomb fluidization threshold, both in the case of a\nlogarithmic relaxation and for the mechanically rectified regime\nleading to a linear creep. In both cases, the global plastic\ndeformation was monitored in parallel with the production rate of\nlocal plastic events. The experimental results were compared to the\noutcome of a simple visco-elastic model, solved numerically in the\ncylindrical geometry, which associates the local fluidity parameter to\na rate of hot-spots production. Even though this model is quite\nsimple, the salient experimental features were reproduced\nsemi-quantitatively. First the effective linear relation between the\ncumulated number of hot-spots and the plastic deformation is recovered\nwith a larger slope in the transient as compared to the rectified\nregime. Second, the qualitative features of the spatial distribution\nof hot spots are recovered in the model in both regimes: a weak radial\ndependence and an almost uniform decrease with time in the logarithmic\ncreep case; and in the case of a linear creep, strong spatial\ndependence of the stationary solution close to the inner cylinder.\n\nInterestingly, at this point, we do not need any non-local model to\nreproduce those generic experimental features. Heterogeneities of the\nstress field need to be taken into account to fully understand the\ndata but not any spatial diffusion of the fluidity which is currently\ntaken into account in more sophisticated fluidity\nmodels~\\cite{Henann2013, Bouzid2013,Henann2014, Bouzid2015}. However,\nit is important to note that this result does not necessarily exclude\nthe generic presence of non-local terms in the rheological picture. It\nmay simply mean that in the present experiments the non-local terms\nwould not contribute significantly to the rheology. The experiments\nwere performed at two different depths of the shearing vane, in the\nbulk and at the surface with an over-load inducing an equivalent\nconfining ptressure. Hot-spots were observed in both configurations\nbut the slope between the cumulated number of hot-spots and the\nplastic deformation differs. A further step to infirm or confirm that\na local model is sufficient for the interpretation of all our data\nwould be to test if this change of slope can be recovered when taking\ninto account the full stress spatial distribution when the vane is\nburied or not. Indeed, the presence of hot-spots in the case when the\nvane is buried may be indicative of the spatial propagation of the\nplastic activity through the material bulk and thus of non-locality.\n\nFinally, we must underline that most of the present results were\nobtained rather far from the dynamical threshold, where essentially,\nwe could individualize the hot-spot apparition. Closer to the\nthreshold and possibly due to spatial coupling and avalanching events,\nit would be interesting to see if quantitatively the simple local\ndescription still holds.\n\n\\acknowledgments This work was funded by a CNES fundamental research\ngrant, a CNES post-doctoral grant and ANR Jamvibe.\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{0}\n\\bibitem{Wood1990}\n  \\Name{Wood D.
