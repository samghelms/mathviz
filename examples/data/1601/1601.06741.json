The Local-arm (Orion-arm) objects are shown to\naffect noticeably the pattern of the $z$ distribution. The\ndeviations from the distribution symmetry are particularly\npronounced for the sample of masers with measured trigonometric\nparallaxes, where the fraction of Local-arm masers is large. The\nsituation with the sample of HII regions in the solar neighborhood\nis similar. We have concluded that it is better to exclude the\nLocal arm from consideration. Based on the model of a\nself-gravitating isothermal disk, we have obtained the following\nestimates from objects located in the inner region of the Galaxy\n$(R\\leq R_0): z_\\odot= -5.7\\pm0.5$~pc and $h_2=24.1\\pm0.9$~pc from\nthe sample of 639 methanol masers, $z_\\odot=-7.6\\pm0.4$~pc and\n$h_2=28.6\\pm0.5$~pc from 878 HII regions, $z_\\odot=-10.1\\pm0.5$~pc\nand $h_2=28.2\\pm0.6$~pc from 538 giant molecular clouds.\n\n\n\n\\section*{INTRODUCTION}\nThe Galactic thin disk attracts the attention of many authors.\nData on young O- and B-type stars, open clusters, Cepheids,\ninfrared sources, molecular clouds, and other young objects are\nused to study its properties. In particular, such parameters as\nthe Sun's distance from the symmetry plane $z_\\odot$ and the\nvertical disk scale height $h$ are important. Note that two terms\nare used: (a) the Sun's height above the Galactic plane and (b)\nthe Sun's position relative to the symmetry plane. The Sun is\nknown to slightly rise above the Galactic plane; therefore, the\nSun's height is positive and is usually designated as $h_\\odot$.\nIn the heliocentric reference frame, the Sun's position relative\nto the symmetry plane of the Galaxy is calculated as the mean of\nthe $z$ coordinates of surrounding objects and, therefore, is\nnegative at a positive height. This distance is usually designated\nas $z_\\odot$.\n\nThe results of the analysis of samples with the distances\nestimated from trigonometric parallaxes (Maiz-Apell\\'aniz 2001),\nphotometrically (Reed 2000), by analyzing open star clusters\n(Piskunov et al. 2006; Elias et al. 2006; Joshi 2007; Buckner and\nFroebrich 2014), or from a combination of various data (Bobylev\nand Bajkova 2016) are primarily of interest. At the same time, the\nless accurate kinematic distances have not lost their significance\nin analyzing the youngest disk objects, such as hydrogen clouds or\nmethanol masers. Using such distances allows large samples of\nobjects distributed almost over the entire Galactic disk to be\nanalyzed (Bronfman et al. 2000; Fish et al. 2003; Paladini et al.\n2004; Pandian et al. 2009).\n\nPreviously (Bobylev and Bajkova 2016), we estimated $z_\\odot$ and\n$h$ using OB associations, HII regions, Wolf\u0096Rayet stars with\nknown photometric distances, and a sample of classical Cepheids\nwith their distances estimated from the period\u0096luminosity\nrelation. In addition, we used a sample of 90 masers with their\ntrigonometric parallaxes measured by VLBI. The errors in these\ndistances are very small, on average, 10\\%. However, when studying\nthis sample, we found that the distribution of masers in a plane\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane has a noticeable asymmetry\ncompared to the Gaussian one. In this paper, we want to ascertain\nwhat caused this asymmetry using various samples and various\nconstraints. The goal of this paper is to minimize the influence\nof the main contributors (the Local arm and the Galactic disk\nwarp) that give rise to an asymmetry in the $z$ distribution of\nyoung Galactic-disk objects and to estimate the vertical disk\nscale height $h.$ To solve this problem, we use a large\nstatistical material from the compilation of Hou and Han (2014),\nwhich contains information about more than 2500 HII regions, 1300\ngiant molecular clouds, and 900 methanol masers with the estimates\nof their kinematic distances.\n\n\\section*{METHODS}\nIn this paper, we use two rectangular coordinate systems: the\nmoving heliocentric $xyz$ and fixed Galactocentric $XYZ$ ones. In\nthe heliocentric $xyz$ coordinate system, the $x$ axis is directed\ntoward the Galactic center, the $y$ axis is in the direction of\nGalactic rotation, and the $z$ axis is directed to the north\nGalactic pole. When we talk about the Galactic quadrants, we mean\nprecisely this coordinate system. Thus, quadrants I, II, III, and\nIV span the ranges of Galactic longitudes $0^\\circ<l\\leq 90^\\circ,\n90^\\circ<l\\leq 180^\\circ, 180^\\circ<l\\leq 270^\\circ,$ and\n$270^\\circ<l\\leq 360^\\circ,$ respectively.\n\nIn the Galactocentric $XYZ$ coordinate system, the $X$ axis is\ndirected to the object from the Galactic center, the $Y$ axis\ncoincides with the direction of Galactic rotation, and the $Z$\naxis is directed toward the north Galactic pole. Here, it is\nimportant to know the Galactocentric distance R0 of the Sun. We\nuse the present-day recent estimate of $R_0=8.34\\pm0.16$~kpc\nobtained by Reid et al. (2014) from a large sample of Galactic\nmasers with their trigonometric parallaxes measured by VLBI. In\nthis coordinate system, it is convenient, for example, to draw the\nspiral pattern or to specify the inner $(R\\leq R_0)$ and outer\n$(R>R_0)$ regions of the Galaxy.\n\nIn the case of an exponential density distribution, the observed\nhistogram of the distribution of objects along the $z$ coordinate\naxis is described by the expression\n \n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  N(z)=N_1 \\exp \\biggl(-{|z-z_\\odot|\\over h_1} \\biggr),\n \\label{elliptic}\n \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N(z)=N_{1}\\exp\\biggl{(}-{|z-z_{\\odot}|\\over h_{1}}\\biggr{)},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mi>z</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>z</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><msub><mi>h</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06741.tex", "nexttext": "\nWhen comparing the results, it should be kept in mind that\ndifferent authors use differing coefficients in the denominator\nwhen applying model~(2): either two,\n $N(z)=N_2{\\hbox { sech}}^2 [(z-z_\\odot)/2h]$\n (Maiz-Apell\\'aniz 2001; Buckner and Froebrich 2014), or one,\n $N(z)=N_2{\\hbox { sech}}^2 [(z-z_\\odot)/h]$ (Marshall et al. 2006).\n\nFinally, the observed frequency distribution of objects along the\n$z$ axis for the Gaussian model is described by the formula\n \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6472, "prevtext": "\nwhere $N_1$ is the normalization coefficient and $z_\\odot$ is the\nSun's distance from the symmetry plane.\n\nIf the model of a self-gravitating isothermal disk is used for the\ndensity distribution, then the observed frequency distribution of\nobjects along the $z$ axis is described by\n \n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  N(z)=N_2{\\hbox { sech}}^2 \\biggl({z-z_\\odot\\over \\sqrt2~h_2}\\biggr).\n \\label{self-grav}\n \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N(z)=N_{2}{\\hbox{ sech}}^{2}\\biggl{(}{z-z_{\\odot}\\over\\sqrt{2}~{}h_{2}}\\biggr{%&#10;)}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mtext>\u00a0sech</mtext><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>z</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>z</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>h</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06741.tex", "nexttext": "\nAs was shown, for example, by Maiz-Apell\\'aniz (2001), $h$ is\ndetermined with the smallest errors based on Eq.~(2); therefore,\nthis model is most attractive among the three described ones.\n\nWhen analyzing the distributions of OB stars and open star\nclusters, many authors (Stothers and Frogel 1974; Reed 2000; Elias\net al. 2006; Joshi 2007) made great efforts to rid the sample of\nthe influence of the Gould Belt. An overview of the Gould-Belt\nproperties can be found, for example, in Bobylev (2014). However,\nthe fraction of Gould-Belt objects is quite small in the samples\nof HII regions or methanol masers. For example, only 12 masers in\nthe sample of 130 masers with measured trigonometric parallaxes\nbelong to the $r<0.5$~kpc neighborhood, where the Gould Belt is\nlocated. However, the Gould Belt entirely belongs to a larger\nstructure, the Local arm (Orion arm).\n\nPreviously (Bobylev and Bajkova 2016), we showed the $z$\ndistribution of 130 masers with measured trigonometric parallaxes\nto be asymmetric.

Since about 40 of the 130\nmasers belong to the Local arm, the effect here can be\nsignificant.\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure} {\\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[width=120mm]{f1.eps}\n \\caption{Distributions of the sample of 1771 HII regions (left) and the sample\nof 653 HII regions in the solar neighborhood, $r<4.5$~kpc, without\nLocal-arm objects (right) in the Galactic $X$Y plane.

The distribution of all HII regions with available\nkinematic distance estimates in the Galactic $XY$ plane is\npresented in Fig.~1, while the distribution of methanol masers and\nGMCs is presented in Fig.~2.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show a fragment of the global four-armed Galactic\nspiral pattern with a constant pitch angle of $-13^\\circ$. The\npattern was constructed in our previous paper (Bobylev and Bajkova\n2014b), where we analyzed the distribution of Galactic masers with\nmeasured trigonometric parallaxes, with the pattern parameters\nhaving been recalculated for the Galactocentric distance of the\nSun adopted in this paper, $R_0=8.3$~kpc. As can be seen from\nthese figures, the distribution of objects agrees satisfactorily\nwith the plotted spiral pattern. In all samples, we see that the\nobjects fall nicely on the segment of the Carina--Sagittarius arm\n(arm II in the figures) in forth quadrant. This is seen best in\nthe distribution of HII regions. Note that Hou and Han (2014) also\nreached the conclusion that the Galaxy most likely has a\nfour-armed spiral pattern with a pitch angle of $-13^\\circ$. At\nthe same time, they concluded that the model of a four-armed\npattern with a variable pitch angle is even more suitable.\n\nThere are photometric distance estimates obtained by different\nauthors for a relatively small number ($\\sim$200) of HII regions\nin the compilation of Hou and Han (2014). These are objects fairly\nclose to the Sun. Their distribution resembles the distribution of\nHII regions within 4.5~kpc of the Sun (the right panel in Fig.~1).\nHou and Han (2014) added about a hundred more masers with measured\ntrigonometric parallaxes to their sample of HII regions. These are\nnot only methanol (CH$_3$OH) masers but also H$_2$O and SiO masers\nobserved in the radio band at various frequencies using VLBI. The\naccuracy of such measurements is, on average, about 10\\%.\n\nIn this paper, we use a more complete sample of masers with\nmeasured trigonometric parallaxes that contains 130 sources. We\ncompiled this sample based on a number of publications. The main\nwork is the review by Reid et al. (2014), where the data on 103\nmasers are described. Subsequently, the publications of these\nauthors with improvements and supplements devoted to the analysis\nof masers located in individual spiral arms of the Galaxy\nappeared. These include Sanna et al. (2014), Sato et al. (2014),\nWu et al. (2014), Choi et al. (2014), and Hachisuka et al. (2015).\nNote the paper of Xu et al. (2013) devoted entirely to the masers\nin the Local arm. We used this sample of 130 masers previously\n(Bobylev and Bajkova 2016).\n\n\\section*{RESULTS}\n\\subsection*{Influence of the Local Arm}\nAs can be seen from Figs. 1 and 2, the Local arm is represented by\na considerable number of objects only in the distribution of HII\nregions. In contrast, the number of Local-arm objects in the\ndistribution of methanol masers is small, while there are\nvirtually no Local-arm objects among the GMCs.\n\nAccording to Bobylev and Bajkova (2014a), we took a\n$6.2\\times1.1$~kpc rectangle oriented at an angle of $-13^\\circ$\nto the y axis and displaced from the Sun by 0.3 kpc toward the\nGalactic anticenter as the simplest Local-arm model. In accordance\nwith this model, we cut out the HII regions on the right panel of\nFig.~1, as marked by the gray rectangle located between the\nPerseus (arm III) and Carina--Sagittarius (arm II) arms.\n\nFigure 3 presents the histograms of the $z$ distribution for HII\nregions with kinematic distances and the sample of masers with\nmeasured trigonometric distances. The light shading on the left\npanel of the figure indicates the distribution for the sample of\n653 HII regions from the $r<4.5$~kpc solar neighborhood that\ncontains no Local-arm objects, while the darker shading indicates\nthe distribution of 134 HII regions belonging to the Local arm.\nThe light shading on the right panel of the figure indicates the\ndistribution for the sample of 88 masers that contains no\nLocal-arm objects, while the thick line marks the distribution for\nthe sample of 42 Local-arm masers.\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure} {\\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[width=160mm]{f3.eps}\n \\caption{Histograms of the $z$ distributions of HII regions and the sample of\nmasers with measured trigonometric parallaxes.

The light shading on the left\npanel of the figure indicates the distribution for the sample of\n653 HII regions from the $r<4.5$~kpc solar neighborhood that\ncontains no Local-arm objects, while the darker shading indicates\nthe distribution of 134 HII regions belonging to the Local arm.\nThe light shading on the right panel of the figure indicates the\ndistribution for the sample of 88 masers that contains no\nLocal-arm objects, while the thick line marks the distribution for\nthe sample of 42 Local-arm masers.\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure} {\\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[width=160mm]{f3.eps}\n \\caption{Histograms of the $z$ distributions of HII regions and the sample of\nmasers with measured trigonometric parallaxes.

Given the height of the Sun\nabove the Galactic plane, we can conclude that the entire Local\narm rises above the Galactic plane by about 25--35 pc.\n\nNote that previously (Bobylev and Bajkova 2015) we revealed\nappreciable ($\\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$) velocities in a direction\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane (the velocities $W$ directed\nalong the $Z$ axis). The Galactic spiral density wave is probably\nresponsible for such periodic perturbations. The perturbations\nturned out to be particularly pronounced in the regions of the\nGould Belt and the Orion and Perseus arms. On the whole, we can\nconclude that it is better not to use the Local-arm objects in the\nsample when analyzing the $z$ distributions of stars. Below, we\napply this rule to all our samples, in particular, to all samples\nin the table.\n\n\\subsection*{The $r<4.5$~kpc Neighborhood}\nThe table presents the results of determining the Sun\u0092s height\n$z_\\odot$ and the vertical disk scale height $h_i, i=1,2,3$ based\non models (1), (2), and (3) using various samples of stars. These\nparameters and their errors were found by fitting the models to\nthe histograms and Monte Carlo simulations. For this purpose, we\nconstructed the histograms with a step in $z$ of 10 pc. We assumed\nthe errors in the distances determined kinematically to be 30\\%\nfor all our samples. The upper part of the table presents the\nresults obtained from the samples of objects that are located in\nthe solar neighborhood with a radius of 4.5 kpc and contain no\nLocal-arm objects.\n\nFigure 4 presents the histograms of the $z$ distributions for 240\nmasers, 653 HII regions, and 364 GMCs, where the curves of models\n(1) and (2) constructed with the parameters specified in the table\nare plotted. As can be seen from the figure, there is good\nagreement between the two model curves for all three samples. The\ndistributions of masers and HII regions are quite symmetric and\nhave no appreciable deviations from the Gaussian. In this regard,\nthe distribution of GMCs appears farther from the Gaussian one,\nwhich may be because their longitude distribution is clumpy.\n\nFigure 5 presents the longitude distribution of masers, HII\nregions, and GMCs. These are the samples used to find the\nparameters specified in the table and to construct Fig.~4. As can\nbe seen from the figure, almost all of the masers lie at\n$|l|<30^\\circ$, because they are located in the inner region of\nthe Galaxy. In the sample of masers, there is virtually no\ninfluence of the disk warp. In the two other samples, the\ninfluence of the disk warp manifests itself as a sine wave\nespecially pronounced in the distribution of HII regions. This can\nbe associated with large random errors in the distances. We used\nthe constraint $r=4.5$~kpc at which, as we expected, the influence\nof the disk warp should not be noticeable. However, because of the\nerrors in the distance estimates (probably more than 30\\%), more\ndistant objects that are significantly affected by the Galactic\ndisk warp penetrated the sample.\n\nThe right panels of Fig.~5 present the Local-arm objects, while\nthe probable members of the Gould Belt (selected from the solar\nneighborhood with a radius $r<0.6$~kpc) are highlighted for the\nHII regions. As can be seen from the figure, HII regions are the\nmost numerous members of the Local arm. 178 HII regions belong to\nthe Local arm; 45 of them are located at $r<0.6$~kpc. The fact\nthat there are quite a few HII regions with large positive $z$ in\nthe range of longitudes $180^\\circ<l<240^\\circ$ is unexpected. At\nleast for the Gould-Belt objects in this range, one might expect\nnegative $z$ (as, for example, for the members of the Orion OB\nassociation). By contrast, the distribution of nearby GMCs that\nform two clumps near $l\\approx90^\\circ$ and $l\\approx240^\\circ$\nagrees well with the expected picture.\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{table}[t]                                     \n \\caption[]{\\small\n The Sun's height $z_\\odot$ and the vertical disk scale height $h_{i, ~i=1,2,3}$\n obtained using models (1), (2), and (3) from three samples with kinematic distances}\n  \\begin{center}  \\label{t:03}   \n  \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|l|c|}\\hline\n $z_\\odot,$~pc & $h_1,$~pc & $h_2,$~pc & $h_3,$~pc & Sample   \\\\\\hline\n\n $~-6.4\\pm0.9$ & $21.4\\pm1.1$ & $20.7\\pm1.8$ & $21.1\\pm1.4$ & 240 masers,  ~~~~~~$r<4.5$~kpc \\\\\n $~-5.1\\pm0.8$ & $41.5\\pm0.8$ & $36.4\\pm0.7$ & $42.0\\pm0.9$ & 653 HII regions, ~$r<4.5$~kpc \\\\\n $-12.2\\pm1.1$ & $47.9\\pm1.5$ & $42.6\\pm1.3$ & $49.5\\pm1.6$ & 364 GMCs,  ~~~~~~~$r<4.5$~kpc \\\\\n \\hline\n $~-5.7\\pm0.5$ & $26.5\\pm0.7$ & $24.1\\pm0.9$ & $25.9\\pm0.6$ & 639 masers,  ~~~~~~~$R\\leq R_0$ \\\\\n $~-7.6\\pm0.4$ & $32.8\\pm0.6$ & $28.6\\pm0.5$ & $33.0\\pm0.6$ & 878 HII regions, ~$R\\leq R_0$ \\\\\n $-10.1\\pm0.5$ & $33.8\\pm0.7$ & $28.2\\pm0.6$ & $32.5\\pm0.7$ & 538 GMCs,  ~~~~~~~$R\\leq R_0$ \\\\\n \\hline\n $~+0.9\\pm1.8$ & $ 93.7\\pm2.6$ & $83.9\\pm2.3$ & $ 98.7\\pm2.9$ & 380 HII regions, ~$R> R_0$ \\\\\n $~+2.4\\pm1.6$ & $110.5\\pm2.9$ & $95.0\\pm2.3$ & $110.1\\pm2.8$ & 474 GMCs,  ~~~~~~~$R> R_0$ \\\\\n \\hline\n \\end{tabular}\\end{center}\n \\end{table}\n\n\n \\begin{figure} {\\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[width=80mm]{f4.eps}\n \\caption{Histograms of the $z$ distributions of 240 methanol masers (top),\n 653 HII regions (middle), and 364 giant molecular\nclouds (bottom).

As Sofue (2011) showed, the distribution of errors\nin the distances when estimated via the line-of-sight velocities\nhas a complex shape like a butterfly: its ``body'' located at the\nGalactic center is elongated in the Galactic center--Sun direction\n(the $X$ axis), while its wings are elongated along the $Y$ axis.\nThe inner regions of the Galaxy have the smallest errors, except\nfor the narrow zone around the tangential circumference.\n\nNote that the $XY$ distribution of almost the entire sample of\nmethanol masers (Fig.~2) is close to the region of small errors in\nthe kinematic distances. Almost the entire sample, 639 methanol\nmasers, lies in the inner region of the galaxy, $R\\leq R_0.$ In\ncontrast, there are few objects, about 130 masers, in the outer\nregion of the Galaxy, $R>R_0,$ and, therefore, we do not use them.\n\nFigure 6 presents the histograms of the $z$ distributions of 639\nmethanol masers, 878 HII regions, and 538 GMCs from the inner\nregion of the Galaxy, $R\\leq R_0.$ The condition that allows the\nLocal-arm region to be excluded was applied to all our samples.\nThe criterion $r<10$~kpc was additionally applied for the HII\nregions and GMCs, which allowed the very distant objects to be\nrejected. All three histograms in this figure are also presented\non a logarithmic scale. The Sun's height and the vertical disk\nscale height obtained from all these samples are given in the\nmiddle and lower parts of the table.\n\nObviously, the results presented in the two lower rows of the\ntable are far from the characteristics of the young disk. The\npositive $z_\\odot$ and the huge $h$ point to a very strong\ninfluence of the disk warp.\n\n\\section*{DISCUSSION}\nComparison of the parameters presented in the table and the\nconstructed z distributions in Figs.~4 and 6 shows an advantage of\nthe samples located in the inner region of the Galaxy. For\nexample, the distribution of GMCs in Fig.~6 looks considerably\nmore symmetric than that in Fig.~4; the distributions of HII\nregions and methanol masers became closer to the Gaussian. The\ncloseness of the distributions to the theoretical ones specified\nby Eqs.~(1), (2), and (3) was estimated each time using the\n$\\chi^2$ test from the formula $\\chi^2=\\Sigma_i\n(\\theta_i-\\Phi_i)^2/\\Phi_i$, where $\\theta_i$ are the sampled\nvalues of the histogram normalized in such a way that $\\Sigma_i\n\\theta_i=1$, $\\Phi_i$ is the theoretical probability distribution\nthat also obeys the normalization condition $\\Sigma \\Phi_i=1$. For\nexample, the $\\chi^2$ estimates for the approximations by\ndistributions~(1), (2), and (3) were 0.284, 0.837, and 0.999,\nrespectively, for the sample of 364 GMCs (Fig.~4) and 0.197,\n0.121, and 0.258 for the sample of 538 GMCs (Fig.~6). Comparison\nof these estimates suggests a more accurate approximation of the\ndata by the theoretical distributions for the sample of 538 GMCs\n(Fig.~6) than that for the sample of 364 GMCs (Fig.~4). This is\nparticularly clearly seen for the approximation by\ndistribution~(2).\n\nThe HII regions, giant molecular clouds, and methanol masers are\nintimately connected between themselves. All these objects are\nvery young (approximately of the same age) and enter into star\nforming regions. One might expect the vertical disk scale heights\nfound from these samples to be close. However, we can see such a\nsituation only in the middle part of the table.\n\nNote that many authors determined the Sun's height above the\nGalactic plane and the vertical disk scale height from various\nsamples of HII regions and from molecular clouds. Masers were used\nmuch more rarely. Reviews of the $z_\\odot$ and $h$ determinations\nfrom various data can be found in Humphreys and Larsen (1995),\nReed (2006), or Bobylev and Bajkova (2016). Therefore, the results\nthat we obtained from a huge sample of methanol masers are of\nconsiderable interest. After all, methanol masers are associated\nwith massive protostars in regions of active star formation, and,\nconsequently, they reflect the distribution of just born massive\nstars.\n\nBronfman et al. (2000) studied the $z$ distribution of 748\nstar-forming regions and H$_2$ clouds with available kinematic\ndistances. These authors found $z_\\odot\\approx5$~pc and\n$h\\approx40$~pc (here, $h$ is the half-width at half maximum of\nthe Gaussian distribution) from HII regions and\n$z_\\odot\\approx-6$~pc and $h\\approx60$~pc from molecular hydrogen\nclouds. They used the inner region of the Galaxy, $R/R_0=0.2-1.0.$\nNevertheless, they found significant differences in the $z_\\odot$\ndeterminations from objects in quadrants I and II\n$(0^\\circ<l<180^\\circ)$ compared to objects in quadrants III and\nIV $(180^\\circ<l<360^\\circ).$ For example, they found\n$z_\\odot=-12$~pc and $z_\\odot=+3$~pc from northern- and\nsouthern-sky molecular clouds, respectively.\n\nBased on a sample of 20 ultracompact HII regions, by first\nestimating their kinematic distances, Fish et al. (2003) found the\nvertical scale height to be $34.7\\pm1.4$~pc (for the derived\n$z_\\odot=-7.3\\pm1.4$~pc). Note that the above scale height is the\nhalf-width at half maximum of the Gaussian.\n\nPaladini et al. (2004) analyzed the $z$ distribution of 550 HII\nregions. The distances to these regions were estimated in part\nkinematically from the Galactic rotation curve and in part based\non the luminosity--diameter correlation. These authors found\n$z_\\odot=-11.3$~pc and $h_3=52$~pc for the inner region of the\nGalaxy, $R<R_0.$\n\nPandian et al. (2009) determined the kinematic distances for 86\nmethanol masers and found the vertical scale heights of the masers\nto be $h_1=20$~pc $(z_\\odot=-12.8$~pc) and $h_3=30$~pc\n$(z_\\odot=-13.1$~pc). In their opinion, these vertical scale\nheights are considerably smaller than those for the Galactic thin\ndisk as a whole. Moreover, these authors also analyzed the $z$\ndistribution for a sample of dark infrared clouds and found\ncomplete agreement of their $h$ value with that found from masers.\n\nNote the paper of Wienen et al. (2015), where the authors\nestimated the kinematic distances to 689 complexes of the ATLASGAL\nprogram (APEX Telescope Large Area Survey; the observations were\nperformed at a wavelength of 870 mm) located in the first and\nfourth Galactic quadrants (almost all of them are located in the\ninner region of the Galaxy). The sources of this program are\nassociated with massive cold clouds of dust located in regions of\nactive star formation. It is important that a special technique\nthat allows one to choose between the two alternative solutions\n(near or far distance) arising in this problem based on the\ncharacter of spectral lines was applied in calculating the\nkinematic distances. A total of more than 1000 individual sources\ncombined into complexes were used. The line-of-sight velocities\nwere calculated as the mean from several molecular lines. Such\nmeasures allowed a high accuracy of the results to be achieved.\nThese authors obtained the following estimates:\n$z_\\odot=-7\\pm1$~pc and $h_1=28\\pm2$~pc.\n\nWe see that the spread in $h$ is from 20 and 50 pc, and there are\ngrounds for this spread: everything depends strongly on how the\nsources are distributed in the Galaxy. However, the minimum values\nof hi specified in the middle part of the table probably\ncorrespond best to the real picture.\n\nThe derived values of $z_\\odot$ lying in the range from $-6$ to\n$-10$~pc are in good agreement with the results of other authors\nobtained from similar objects. At the same time, these values\ndiffer noticeably from the most probable estimates computed by\nusing older objects (open star clusters, Cepheids, etc.). For\nexample, previously (Bobylev and Bajkova 2016) we calculated the\nmean $z_\\odot=-16\\pm2$~pc based on the individual $z_\\odot$\ndeterminations from various samples.\n\nWe can conclude that our values of $h$ obtained from the samples\nof HII regions, GMCs, and methanol masers (at $R\\leq R_0$) reflect\nthe character of the vertical scale height for the youngest stars\nin the Galaxy.\n\n\\section*{CONCLUSIONS}\nWe obtained new estimates of the Sun\u0092s distance from the symmetry\nplane $z_\\odot$ and the vertical disk scale height h using data on\nHII regions, giant molecular clouds, and methanol masers. For all\nthese objects, there are distance estimates obtained by Hou and\nHan (2014) kinematically.\n\nFirst, we showed that the entire structure of the Local arm\naffects noticeably the pattern of the distribution along an axis\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane. The entire Local arm rises\nabove the Galactic plane by about 25--35~pc. The deviations from\nthe distribution symmetry are particularly pronounced for the\nsample of masers with measured trigonometric parallaxes, where the\nfraction of Local-Arm masers is large. The situation with the\nsample of HII regions in the solar neighborhood is similar.\n\nAs a result, we concluded that it is better to exclude the\nLocal-arm objects from consideration. Moreover, we found that the\nsough-for parameters were determined with the smallest errors from\nthe objects located in the inner region of the Galaxy $(R\\leq\nR_0).$\n\nWe applied three models of the density distribution to all three\nsamples: an exponential distribution, a self-gravitating\nisothermal disk, and a Gaussian density distribution. All three\nmodels yield close values of $h;$ therefore, we give only those\nfound on the basis of the model of a self-gravitating isothermal\ndisk. The following estimates were obtained from the objects\nlocated in the inner region of the Galaxy $(R\\leq R_0): z_\\odot=\n-5.7\\pm0.5$~pc and $h_2=24.1\\pm0.9$~pc from the sample of 639\nmethanol masers, $z_\\odot=-7.6\\pm0.4$~pc and $h_2=28.6\\pm0.5$~pc\nfrom 878 HII regions, and $z_\\odot=-10.1\\pm0.5$~pc and\n$h_2=28.2\\pm0.6$~pc from 538 giant molecular clouds.\n\n\\subsection*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}\nWe are grateful to the referees for their helpful\nremarks that contributed to an improvement of this paper.
