Indeed,\nin all cases, such organizing principles \nare then ultimately manifested \nin {\\it scaling relations}\\/ which \ncharacterize how the different properties of the ensemble \nconstituents scale with respect to each other across the ensemble as a whole.  \nThere are ultimately three different scaling relations which are critical for the\nphenomenology (and eventual viability) of the DDM ensemble.\nThe first of these is the relationship between the mass of an ensemble constituent \nand its cosmological abundance.  This usually depends on the theoretical structure of the ensemble along \nwith the additional choice of a particular \nthe additional choice of a particular \ncosmological history.   The second is a relationship between the mass of \nthe constituent and its decay width into SM  states.  \nThis usually depends on the structure of the ensemble along with the additional \nchoice of particular couplings between the ensemble and SM  states.\nHowever, there is a third scaling relation which follows directly from the structure\nof the ensemble itself, without any additional assumptions.\nThis is the  relationship between the \nmass of the constituent and the number of constituents with similar masses --- {{\\it i.e.}\\/}, \nthe density of states for the ensemble.  In some sense,\nthis latter scaling relation can be viewed as the most fundamental,\ndescribing the intrinsic spectral structure of the ensemble \nas a single entity.\n\n\nThere are many possible underlying theoretical structures \n--- {{\\it i.e.}\\/}, many possible over-arching theoretical constructions ---\nthat have been shown to give rise to viable \nDDM ensembles.\nFor example, viable\nDDM scenarios are known to exist in which the constituents are\nthe Kaluza-Klein modes of a single higher-dimensional field~\\cite{DDM1,DDM2,DDMAxion}.\nAlternatively, viable DDM scenarios exist in which \nthe constituents are the ``hadronic'' resonances which appear in the confining phase of a\nstrongly-coupled theory~\\cite{DDMString}, or as the oscillator states of \na fundamental string~\\cite{DDMString}.  In such cases, the sets of\nscaling relations which characterize the ensemble are fully determined\nby the underlying parameters of the theory.  \n\nIn this paper, however, we shall consider another possibility entirely, one in which\nthe properties of the ensemble constituents are {\\it not}\\/ dictated by an underlying theoretical construction, but\nare instead determined by random dynamical processes in the early universe.  \nAs we shall demonstrate, this need not be problematic because the required \nscaling relations can actually arise {\\it statistically}\\/, as {\\it emergent} phenomena.\nIndeed,\nalthough the mass, decay width, and cosmological abundance of each individual\nensemble constituent continues to be essentially random, \nthere exists a well-defined probability \ndistribution function (PDF) for each of these quantities across the ensemble \nas a whole.  As the number of constituents in the ensemble grows\nlarge --- the regime of interest for DDM --- the\ndistribution of each such quantity across the ensemble \nconforms to the corresponding PDF with\nan increasingly overwhelming probability.\nThus, such scenarios naturally\ngive rise to robust --- albeit probabilistic --- predictions for one or\nmore of the fundamental scaling relations that characterize the ensemble.\nMoreover, in scenarios of this sort,\nthe properties of the ensemble \ncontinue to be determined --- up to statistical fluctuations --- by only a few model \nparameters.\n\nIn this paper we shall provide a concrete example of a scenario in which a \n``statistical'' DDM ensemble of this sort arises.  \nThis will happen in essentially two steps.\nFirst, we shall demonstrate how random processes can give rise to a\nunique mass spectrum for a non-trivial dark sector.\nAs required, this spectrum can be recast as a scaling relationship between \nthe masses and density of states across a dark-sector ensemble.\nTo do this, we consider a\nclass of models in which there exists a hidden sector comprising one or more fields which\ntransform in some non-trivial multiplet representation of a large hidden-sector symmetry\ngroup.  Hidden-sector symmetries of this sort are well-motivated both in grand\nunified theories and in string theory.   \nIf this symmetry remains unbroken, the masses of the individual\ncomponent fields within these multiplets --- the fields which play the role of \nthe DDM ensemble constituents in models of this sort --- remain equal.  However, \nin cases in which this symmetry group is spontaneously broken, the degeneracy is \nlifted and a non-trivial mass spectrum for these component fields is generated.\nThis mass spectrum depends on the particular location on the vacuum manifold \nchosen by the symmetry-breaking dynamics.  Since this choice is essentially arbitrary, \nthe masses of the individual ensemble constituents are essentially random.  \nNevertheless, as we shall demonstrate, a predictable density-of-states function emerges in the limit that \nthe number of component fields is large.  \nMoreover, \nwe shall find that\nthis emergent density-of-states function \nis quite unlike those that emerge for KK towers, dark ``hadrons'',\nor other theoretical constructs.   Indeed, we shall see that it exhibits classic\nhallmarks that reflect its essentially random, statistical origin.\n\nThe second step is then to use this statistical scaling relation between masses and density \nof states in order to derive the additional required scaling relations \ninvolving decay widths/lifetimes and cosmological abundances.\nHowever, this second step need not necessarily involve \nadditional random dynamics.\nIndeed, once our statistical density-of-states function is specified,\nwe shall see that standard, well-established mechanisms for deriving \nthese additional scaling\nrelations will suffice. \nIn our case, however, we shall nevertheless introduce \na second (relatively minor) source of randomness into this step as well.\nOur purpose in doing this will be to remain as general as possible;\nwe shall nevertheless find that \nthis additional randomness does not disturb the main \nphenomenological features of our construction.\n\n\nThe ultimate result of our construction will be a collection of \nparticles whose scaling relations \nare emergent and satisfy the basic criteria for a viable DDM ensemble,\nwith lifetimes suitably balanced against abundances.\nMoreover, as we shall see, our underlying ``statistical'' density-of-states function \nwill be responsible in large measure for this success. \nThus, in this sense, we shall conclude that\nrandomness in the dark sector coexists quite naturally with DDM.~\n\nThis paper is organized as follows.  In Sect.~\\ref{sec:Model}, we present a simple\ntoy model of the sort described above --- {{\\it i.e.}\\/}, a model\nin which our non-minimal dark-sector constituents \ntransform as the elements of a multiplet\nof a large hidden-sector $SU(N)$ symmetry group,\nand in which\na non-trivial mass spectrum for these fields \nis generated via the random spontaneous breaking of this symmetry.\nThen, in Sect.~\\ref{sec:RandomMatrixGeneration}, \nusing the methods of random-matrix theory,  \nwe analyze the statistical properties of the resulting mass spectrum and the corresponding\ndensity of states.    We stress that our results up to this point are completely general,\nand need not have any particular connection to DDM.~  \nHowever, in \nSect.~\\ref{sec:DetectionAbundance}, we then examine how these ensemble constituents \ncan be coupled in a self-consistent manner to other fields of the theory, including \nthe fields of the SM.~   Such couplings to the SM will then enable us to translate our statistical mass spectra\ninto statistical relations governing the spectra of decay widths and cosmological abundances,\nand we shall find that  \nensembles \nexhibiting the properties of viable DDM ensembles\nnaturally emerge.\nFinally, in Sect.~\\ref{sec:IndirectDet}, we investigate the prospects for observing \nthe signals of such scenarios in dark-matter indirect-detection experiments.\nOur conclusions are summarized in Sect.~\\ref{sec:Conclusion}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Randomness in the Dark Sector:   An Example Model\\label{sec:Model}}\n\n\n\nIn this section, we introduce a simple toy model of the dark sector in which\nthe mass of each component within the resulting ensemble of states is determined\nthrough an essentially  random process.\nOur discussion in this section will be limited to setting up the model itself and the method\nby which these masses are generated. \nSect.~\\ref{sec:RandomMatrixGeneration} will then be devoted to an analysis of \nthe statistical properties of the resulting mass spectrum and the scaling   \nbehaviors it exhibits.\n\nOur toy model of the dark sector is as follows.\nWe begin by considering a scalar field $\\phi$ which\ntransforms in the fundamental representation of some $SU(N)$ symmetry --- a symmetry\nwhich may in principle be either global or local.

For example, the $\\IZ_2^\\eta$ symmetry ensures that\nthe eigenvalues $m_i^2$ of $\\mathcal{M}^2$ be positive-definite by forbidding operators\nsuch as $\\mathcal{O}_{{\\not{\\IZ}_2^\\eta}} \\sim \\phi^\\dagger \\eta \\phi$ from appearing in\nthe scalar potential in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:V0}).  This, in turn, ensures that the $\\IZ_2^\\phi$\nsymmetry remain unbroken at the minimum of the potential.  Thus, in the absence of\nany additional source of $\\IZ_2^\\phi$-symmetry breaking, the lightest of the $\\phi_i$\nmass eigenstates is absolutely stable.\n\nIt is perhaps also worth emphasizing that no splitting between the masses of the\nreal and imaginary components of the complex scalars $\\phi_i$ results from the\nspontaneous breaking of the $SU(N)$ symmetry in this model.\nIndeed, even in the broken phase of the theory, the Lagrangian for our toy model\nremains invariant under independent phase rotations of each of the $\\phi_i$.\nThis is a reflection of the fact that\neven in the case in which all of the $v_a$ are non-zero, the $SU(N)$ symmetry\nis not broken completely.  Indeed, the breaking of a symmetry by the VEV of\nan adjoint field cannot reduce the rank of the group.  Rather, a residual\n$U(1)^{N-1}$ symmetry always remains;  this may be either global or local, depending on\nthe construction.  Moreover, it can be seen from Eq.~(\\ref{eq:V0}) that our theory\nis also invariant under an ``accidental'' global $U(1)$ symmetry which corresponds\nto an overall phase rotation of the multiplet $\\phi$.  This overall $U(1)^{N}$\nsymmetry corresponds to the invariance of the Lagrangian under phase rotations of\nthe $N$ different fields $\\phi_i$.\n\nFinally, we remark that \nwe have yet to specify whether the $SU(N)$ symmetry is local or\nglobal.  Indeed, this choice does not have any effect on the mass spectrum of\nthe dark-sector ensemble --- at least at tree level.  However, this choice does have other\nimportant phenomenological consequences.  In the case in which this \nsymmetry is global, for example, a massless Goldstone boson will appear in the spectrum \nof the low-energy theory for each spontaneously-broken symmetry generator.\nThe presence of such a large number of Goldstone bosons is difficult to reconcile with \nobservational data.  These particles can violate bounds on the number of \nlight, thermalized degrees of freedom derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\ndata~\\cite{Ade:2015xua}.  They may also potentially mediate long-range interactions \nbetween dark-matter particles which conflict with bounds from observations of large- \nand small-scale structure (see, {{\\it e.g.}\\/}, Ref.~\\cite{Ackerman:mha}).

For example, the $\\IZ_2^\\eta$ symmetry ensures that\nthe eigenvalues $m_i^2$ of $\\mathcal{M}^2$ be positive-definite by forbidding operators\nsuch as $\\mathcal{O}_{{\\not{\\IZ}_2^\\eta}} \\sim \\phi^\\dagger \\eta \\phi$ from appearing in\nthe scalar potential in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:V0}).  This, in turn, ensures that the $\\IZ_2^\\phi$\nsymmetry remain unbroken at the minimum of the potential.  Thus, in the absence of\nany additional source of $\\IZ_2^\\phi$-symmetry breaking, the lightest of the $\\phi_i$\nmass eigenstates is absolutely stable.\n\nIt is perhaps also worth emphasizing that no splitting between the masses of the\nreal and imaginary components of the complex scalars $\\phi_i$ results from the\nspontaneous breaking of the $SU(N)$ symmetry in this model.\nIndeed, even in the broken phase of the theory, the Lagrangian for our toy model\nremains invariant under independent phase rotations of each of the $\\phi_i$.\nThis is a reflection of the fact that\neven in the case in which all of the $v_a$ are non-zero, the $SU(N)$ symmetry\nis not broken completely.  Indeed, the breaking of a symmetry by the VEV of\nan adjoint field cannot reduce the rank of the group.  Rather, a residual\n$U(1)^{N-1}$ symmetry always remains;  this may be either global or local, depending on\nthe construction.  Moreover, it can be seen from Eq.~(\\ref{eq:V0}) that our theory\nis also invariant under an ``accidental'' global $U(1)$ symmetry which corresponds\nto an overall phase rotation of the multiplet $\\phi$.  This overall $U(1)^{N}$\nsymmetry corresponds to the invariance of the Lagrangian under phase rotations of\nthe $N$ different fields $\\phi_i$.\n\nFinally, we remark that \nwe have yet to specify whether the $SU(N)$ symmetry is local or\nglobal.  Indeed, this choice does not have any effect on the mass spectrum of\nthe dark-sector ensemble --- at least at tree level.  However, this choice does have other\nimportant phenomenological consequences.  In the case in which this \nsymmetry is global, for example, a massless Goldstone boson will appear in the spectrum \nof the low-energy theory for each spontaneously-broken symmetry generator.\nThe presence of such a large number of Goldstone bosons is difficult to reconcile with \nobservational data.  These particles can violate bounds on the number of \nlight, thermalized degrees of freedom derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\ndata~\\cite{Ade:2015xua}.  They may also potentially mediate long-range interactions \nbetween dark-matter particles which conflict with bounds from observations of large- \nand small-scale structure (see, {{\\it e.g.}\\/}, Ref.~\\cite{Ackerman:mha}).  There are two ways\nof evading these constraints.  One is to gauge the $SU(N)$ symmetry.  In this \ncase, the Goldstone bosons are absorbed into the longitudinal polarizations of the \nmassive gauge bosons, and no new light degrees of freedom remain in the theory.\nThe other is to introduce an additional, explicit breaking of the $SU(N)$ symmetry \nwhich leads to the generation of a small but non-zero mass for each would-be Goldstone \nboson.

In particular, we perform a numerical analysis \nof these distributions according to the following procedure.\nFor a given value of $N$, we randomly generate a number $n_{\\mathrm{mat}}$\nof $\\langle{\\eta}\\rangle$ matrices\nfollowing the procedure described above Eq.~(\\ref{eqhow}),\nwhere $n_{\\mathrm{mat}}$ is chosen\nsuch that the total number of individual eigenvalues in the data set\nis fixed to a reference value which we take to be  $5 \\times 10^4$.  \nFor each of these matrices, we diagonalize the\ncorresponding mass-squared matrix for the ensemble constituents in order to \nobtain their masses $m_i$.  We then combine the $m_i$ values for\nall of the matrices in our sample into a single data set, a histogram of\nwhich provides a numerical approximation to the corresponding analytic \ndensity-of-states function $n_{\\rm SU(N)}(\\tilde{m})$.  For purposes of comparison,\nwe also derive a numerical approximation for $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$ --- \nthe density-of-states function obtained for a $U(N)$ rather than an \n$SU(N)$ symmetry group --- using the same procedure.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionN1000}, we show the density-of-states function\n$n(\\tilde{m})$ for the ensemble constituents generated by diagonalizing\nrandomly generated mass matrices, for $N=1000$ and $\\tilde{M}=0$.\nThe blue histogram corresponds to the $SU(N)$ case, while\nthe orange histogram corresponds to the $U(N)$ case.\nIn each case, the results correspond to a data set\ncomprising the ensemble-constituent masses obtained for a sample of\n$n_{\\mathrm{mat}} = 50$ randomly generated matrices.\nBy contrast, the red curve in Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionN1000}\nrepresents the analytical function\n$n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:DensityOfStateswithm}).  \nAs evident from Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionN1000}, the function \n$n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ provides an excellent approximation \nto the histogram data, as claimed.  Moreover, for such a large value of $N$, \nthe functions $n_{\\mathrm{GUE}}(\\tilde{m})$ and $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$\nare essentially indistinguishable from $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$.\nThus all three functions do an excellent job of approximating the data for $N\\gg 1$.\n\nIt is also interesting to examine how the results are modified in the regime\nin which $N$ is small and the Wigner semicircle distribution provides a less\nreliable approximation for the true density of states for the ensemble.\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionSmallN}, we show the corresponding results for\n$N = 5$ (left panel), $N = 10$ (center panel), and $N=20$ (right panel).\nIn each panel, the blue and orange histograms each represent a data set\ncomprising the ensemble-constituent masses obtained for a sample of\n$n_{\\mathrm{mat}}$ randomly generated $\\langle{\\eta}\\rangle$ matrices,\nwhere $n_{\\mathrm{mat}}$ is chosen in each case such that the total number\nof individual mass eigenvalues in the data set is $5 \\times 10^4$.\nAs in Fig.~\\protect\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionN1000}, the blue histogram corresponds\nto a model in which the symmetry group is $SU(N)$ while the orange histogram corresponds\nto a model in which the symmetry group is $U(N)$.\nThe solid, dot-dashed, and dashed curves in each panel\ncorrespond to $n_{\\mathrm{GUE}}(\\tilde{m})$, $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$, and\n$n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$, respectively.\n\nWe see from Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionSmallN}\nthat $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ aptly characterizes the overall\n``envelope'' of the true density of states for small $N$ in both the $U(N)$\nand $SU(N)$ cases, just as it does for large $N$.  However, for small $N$, the\ntrue density of states for these cases also exhibits\n {\\it oscillations}\\/ around this envelope --- oscillations which grow increasingly\npronounced with decreasing $N$.  For the case in which the symmetry group is\n$U(N)$, the histogram data are distributed according to the density-of-states\nfunction $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$, as expected; \nthis function actually includes the oscillations, and the histogram differs \nfrom  $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$ only because of random fluctuations.\nHowever, for the case in which the symmetry group is $SU(N)$, the amplitude of \nthe oscillations is significantly more pronounced, and we see that neither \n$n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$ nor $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ are accurate \ndescriptions of the density of states for the case of an $SU(N)$ symmetry group at \nsmall $N$.   However, as $N$ grows larger (as illustrated in the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionSmallN}),\nthe oscillations fade away in relative magnitude for both the $U(N)$ and $SU(N)$ cases, and \nthe actual distributions qualitatively begin to approach \n$n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{CompMValsLargeNPlotN1000.pdf}\n  \\caption{The density-of-states function $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ for\n    several different choices of the mass parameter $\\tilde{M}$.

In Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionMadMLargeN}, we display curves of\nthe Wigner density-of-states function $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ for different\nvalues of $\\tilde{M}$.

For purposes of comparison,\nwe also derive a numerical approximation for $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$ --- \nthe density-of-states function obtained for a $U(N)$ rather than an \n$SU(N)$ symmetry group --- using the same procedure.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionN1000}, we show the density-of-states function\n$n(\\tilde{m})$ for the ensemble constituents generated by diagonalizing\nrandomly generated mass matrices, for $N=1000$ and $\\tilde{M}=0$.\nThe blue histogram corresponds to the $SU(N)$ case, while\nthe orange histogram corresponds to the $U(N)$ case.\nIn each case, the results correspond to a data set\ncomprising the ensemble-constituent masses obtained for a sample of\n$n_{\\mathrm{mat}} = 50$ randomly generated matrices.\nBy contrast, the red curve in Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionN1000}\nrepresents the analytical function\n$n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:DensityOfStateswithm}).  \nAs evident from Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionN1000}, the function \n$n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ provides an excellent approximation \nto the histogram data, as claimed.

However, for small $N$, the\ntrue density of states for these cases also exhibits\n {\\it oscillations}\\/ around this envelope --- oscillations which grow increasingly\npronounced with decreasing $N$.  For the case in which the symmetry group is\n$U(N)$, the histogram data are distributed according to the density-of-states\nfunction $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$, as expected; \nthis function actually includes the oscillations, and the histogram differs \nfrom  $n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$ only because of random fluctuations.\nHowever, for the case in which the symmetry group is $SU(N)$, the amplitude of \nthe oscillations is significantly more pronounced, and we see that neither \n$n_{\\mathrm{FTE}}(\\tilde{m})$ nor $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ are accurate \ndescriptions of the density of states for the case of an $SU(N)$ symmetry group at \nsmall $N$.   However, as $N$ grows larger (as illustrated in the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:DOSFunctionSmallN}),\nthe oscillations fade away in relative magnitude for both the $U(N)$ and $SU(N)$ cases, and \nthe actual distributions qualitatively begin to approach \n$n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{CompMValsLargeNPlotN1000.pdf}\n  \\caption{The density-of-states function $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(\\tilde{m})$ for\n    several different choices of the mass parameter $\\tilde{M}$.

In this section, we discuss how\na spectrum of decay widths and abundances can be generated for the $\\phi_i$ and \nhow the interplay between the corresponding scaling relations and the density-of-states\nfunction derived in the previous section can give rise to a DDM-like balancing \nbetween decay widths and abundances across the ensemble as a whole.  \nIndeed, as we shall see,\na density-of-states function which decreases with the mass $m$ \n --- as emerges for our random ensemble ---\ncan accommodate a broader range\nof scaling relations between decay width and mass, and between abundance and mass,\nthan is possible for other distributions.  \n\nNote that here and in the following, indices $i,j=1,2,...,N$ now label \nthe different mass eigenstates $\\phi_i$.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Dark-Matter Decay\\label{sec:Decay}}\n\n\n\nWe begin with a discussion of the decay properties of the ensemble constituents. \nThe toy model introduced in Sect.~\\ref{sec:Model} involves only two additional\nmatter fields beyond those of the SM: the $SU(N)$ multiplets $\\phi$ and $\\eta$.  Given\nthe symmetry structure of the model, these fields couple to the fields of the SM only via \ngravitational interactions.  Moreover, the $\\IZ_2^\\phi$ symmetry of the model forbids \nall scattering and decay processes wherein number of $\\phi_i$ particles in the \ninitial and final states differ by an odd number.  As a consequence, the lightest of the \n$\\phi_i$ is absolutely stable.  Furthermore, the decay widths of the heavier ensemble\nconstituents are typically dominated by {\\it intra-ensemble}\\/ decays --- {{\\it i.e.}\\/}, decays to \nfinal states involving other, lighter $\\phi_i$.  The most relevant intra-ensemble decay\nprocesses include $\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j \\eta_{a}$, \n$\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j \\phi_k \\phi_\\ell$, and, in cases in which the $SU(N)$\nsymmetry is local, $\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j G^\\mu_{a}$, where $G^\\mu_a$ denotes one \nof the $SU(N)$ gauge fields.\n\nWhile channels of this sort provide a natural decay mechanism for the ensemble \nconstituents within the context of this minimal statistical DDM model, these channels\nare phenomenologically problematic for two reasons.  First, the corresponding decay \nwidths are typically far too large.    \nSecond, because the final states consist solely of hidden-sector particles, these decays \nare essentially invisible and yield no observable indirect detection signals.\nThus, in order to ensure phenomenological viability, we must find a way to suppress \nthese contributions while at the same time arranging additional mechanisms through which \nthe $\\phi_i$ can decay.    \n\nThe simplest and most natural way of suppressing processes involving $\\eta_a$ or $G^\\mu_a$\nin the final state is to arrange for the masses of the $\\phi_i$ to be parametrically small \nin comparison with the masses of the $\\eta_a$ and $G^\\mu_a$.  \nIndeed, this is not difficult to arrange.  The overall mass scale for the $\\phi_i$ \nis determined by the mass parameter $M$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:V0}) and by the parameter \ncombination $\\sqrt{\\xi_1} v$.  By contrast, the overall mass scales for the $\\eta_a$ and \nthe $G^\\mu_a$ are both independent of $M$ and $\\xi_1$.  Thus, suppressing decays such\nas $\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j \\eta_{a}$ and $\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j G^\\mu_{a}$  \nis simply a matter of taking $M$ and $\\xi_1$ to be sufficiently small. \nIndeed,  this parametric separation is \nanalogous to the situation in the \nSM lepton sector, where Majorana masses and Yukawa couplings of the light fermions play \nthe roles of $M$ and $\\xi_1$, respectively.\n\nIntra-ensemble decay processes such as $\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j \\phi_k \\phi_\\ell$, \nin which one of the $\\phi_i$ decays to a final state involving only other, lighter ensemble \nconstituents, can also naturally be suppressed in a number of ways.  First of all,\ncontributions to such processes which arise due to the quartic interaction in \nEq.~(\\ref{eq:V0}) can be suppressed simply by taking the coupling coefficient $\\xi_\\phi$,\nwhich plays no other important role in the phenomenology of the model, to be sufficiently small.  \nMoreover, the remaining contributions, which proceed via diagrams involving virtual $\\eta_a$ or \n$G^\\mu_a$ fields, can likewise be suppressed by taking $M$ and $\\xi_1$ to be sufficiently small.   \nAlternatively, intra-ensemble decay processes of this sort can also be forbidden simply by \nkinematical considerations.  For example, processes of the form \n$\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j \\phi_k \\phi_\\ell$ are kinematically forbidden unless  \n$m_{\\phi_i} > 3m_0$, where $m_0$ is the mass of the lightest ensemble\nconstituent.  If the mass spectrum of the theory is such that this condition is not\nsatisfied for even the heaviest of the $\\phi_i$, such intra-ensemble decays cannot occur.\nThis is not difficult to arrange.  Indeed, $m_0$ is essentially determined by $M$, while \nthe splitting between the masses of the heaviest and lightest of the ensemble constituents \nis essentially determined by $\\sqrt{\\xi_1} v$; thus, the lightest mass and the largest mass \nsplitting are parametrically independent.  \n\nHaving discussed how contributions from processes such as \n$\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j \\phi_k \\phi_\\ell$, $\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j \\eta_{a}$,\nand $\\phi_i \\rightarrow \\phi_j G^\\mu_{a}$ to the decay widths of the $\\phi_i$ can be\nsuppressed, we now turn to examine how decay widths of the correct order of magnitude can be \ngenerated for these fields.\nFor concreteness, we present an example of how the ensemble constituents \ncan be coupled to the fields of the SM --- and in particular the photon field.  We \nemphasize that this is merely one example, and that other self-consistent \ncoupling scenarios which lead to alternative decay phenomenologies for the $\\phi_i$\nare possible as well.  \n\nAs discussed above, our first step is to break the $\\IZ_2^\\phi$ symmetry.\nIn order to do this in a controlled \nmanner, we introduce an additional field $B$ which is odd under $\\IZ_2^\\phi$ and \ntransforms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$.\nGiven the symmetry structure of the visible and hidden \nsectors, the simplest method of coupling the $\\phi_i$ to the photon field is via\nan effective operator of the form\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 51420, "prevtext": "\nwhere $i$ labels the bin, where $n_{\\rm bins}$ indicates the total number of bins,\nwhere $X_i$ is the ``observed'' number of eigenvalues in the bin,\n and where $E_i$ is the ``expected'' number of eigenvalues in the bin according to the $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$ \neigenvalue-distribution function.\nGiven that we do not have an analytic form for $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$, we obtain our values of $E_i$\nvia the methods outlined above, choosing a value of $n_{\\rm mat}$ for each $N$ such\nthat a suitably large total number $n_{\\rm eigs}$ of random eigenvalues are generated.  \n\nThe value of $\\chi^2$ in Eq.~(\\ref{chi2def}) represents the extent to which the eigenvalues\nof a single randomly-generated $SU(N)$ matrix match $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$, as desired.   Of course,\ndepending on the particular matrix generated, the corresponding $\\chi^2$ could have values\nwhich are extremely large or extremely small.   What interests us is therefore $\\langle \\chi^2\\rangle$,\n{{\\it i.e.}\\/}, the {\\it average}\\/ value that $\\chi^2$ might have\nif we repeat this process $N'$ times.\nTo help us interpret the result, we then calculate a\nGaussian-equivalent significance $\\sigma$ \nby comparing $\\langle \\chi^2\\rangle$  to a $\\chi^2$-distribution with $n_{\\rm bins} - 1$ degrees of freedom in \norder to obtain a $p$-value, and then asking to what statistical significance $\\sigma$ this $p$-value would \ncorrespond for a Gaussian distribution.  \nThis value of $\\sigma$ thus  represents the degree to which, on average, the eigenvalues from a single random \nmatrix seem {\\it not}\\/ to have been drawn from the expected  $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$ \ndistribution.  A lower significance $\\sigma$ thus indicates better agreement with our expectations.\n\nOur results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:oneroll} for\nthe case of $n_{\\rm eigs}=1.8\\times 10^6$,\n$N' = 10^5$, and $n_{\\rm bins}=40$.\nWe have also taken $\\tilde M=0$.\nNote that none of the qualitative results in this figure would change significantly if other values were chosen.\nWe also remark that\nwhen establishing our bins, we have \nwe have assumed an eigenvalue range from $\\tilde{m} = 0$ to $\\tilde{m} = \\tilde{m}_{\\rm WS}^{\\rm (max)}$, \nwhere  $\\tilde{m}_{\\rm WS}^{\\rm (max)}$ is the maximum possible eigenvalue $\\tilde{m}$ that can be obtained for the Wigner semicircle distribution for that same value of $N$.  \nAlthough eigenvalues values larger than $\\tilde{m}_{\\rm WS}^{\\rm (max)}$ are possible for the true $SU(N)$ ensemble,\nwe have already seen that such eigenvalues are exceedingly rare\nand populate a low-statistics regime in which the ``expected'' bin population is extremely small.  \nIncluding data in this regime therefore tends to skew the statistics in non-meaningful ways.   \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{EquivSigmaPlot_ex3.pdf}\n  \\caption{The accuracy with which the $N$ eigenvalues of a {\\it single}\\ randomly-chosen $SU(N)$ matrix\n    match, on average, the $SU(N)$ probability distribution function\n     $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$, plotted as a function of $N$.\n      As discussed in the text, this accuracy is quoted in terms of the traditional Gaussian-equivalent \n        significance $\\sigma$ of the negative assertion\n   that on average the eigenvalues derived from a single random matrix seem {\\it not}\\/ to be drawn \nfrom the expected distribution $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$.\n     Thus lower significance $\\sigma$ indicates better agreement with $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$.}\n\\label{fig:oneroll}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nSeveral features are immediately clear from Fig.~\\ref{fig:oneroll}.

One such feature is the characteristic shape of the \nspectral baseline ({{\\it i.e.}\\/}, the orange curve), which is primarily determined \nby the density-of-states function $n_{\\mathrm{WS}}(n)$ for our statistical DDM ensemble.\nIndeed, in the center and right panels of the figure, the influence of this \ndensity-of-states function on the spectral envelope is unmistakable.\nIn the left panel, which corresponds to the case in which $m_\\chi = 100$~GeV, \nthe shape of the envelope is modified at energies around $E_\\gamma \\approx 25$~GeV\ndue to the effect of the annihilation resonance, which suppresses the abundances\n(and therefore the photon-flux contributions) of ensemble constituents with \nmasses $m_i \\sim m_\\chi/2 \\approx 50$~GeV.  ~Nevertheless, even in this case, the\ninfluence of the density-of-states function on the spectral baseline is still  \nevident --- especially at large $E_\\gamma$.\n   \nAnother distinctive feature which emerges in the gamma-ray spectra of statistical \nDDM ensembles is the pattern of fluctuations in the observed spectrum around the \nspectral baseline.\nIndeed, in the regime in which the scale of the splitting between the $m_i$ exceeds the energy resolution\nof the detector,\nsignificant fluctuations are apparent across the relevant\nrange of $E_\\gamma$.  \nThese fluctuations (along with\ndetector effects) can obscure features which would otherwise be apparent in the gamma-ray \nspectrum.  For example, the pronounced dip in the spectral baseline due to the \nannihilation resonance is only partially evident in the observed gamma-ray spectrum for the \ncorresponding DDM ensemble.   \nBy contrast, we see that in the regime in which $E_\\gamma$ is large and the \nenergy resolution of the detector is less than or comparable to the rough scale of the splitting\nbetween the \nmass eigenvalues $m_i$, the effect of the random alignment of the $\\langle B_i\\rangle$ is \nsmeared out by detector effects.  \nConsequently, in this regime, the observed spectrum is reasonably well approximated by the spectral baseline\nup to the cutoff at $E_\\gamma \\approx 100$~GeV, which corresponds to the upper limit of the Wigner-Semicircle distribution for this choice of parameters.   The divergence between the observed spectrum and the spectral baseline \nabove this cutoff is solely a result of detector smearing.\n\n\nWe note that the flux spectrum shown in left panel of \nFig.~\\ref{fig:DMDecaySpectrum} displays fluctuations with magnitudes as large as \n50\\% or more of the overall baseline.  This is comparable to the fractional uncertainty \nin the measurement of the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray background at \n$E \\sim 100$~GeV~\\cite{Ackermann:2014usa}.  This implies that the potentially \nidentifiable signals of statistical DDM ensembles of this sort may manifest themselves \nnot only in the distinctive shape of the overall baseline associated with the gamma-ray spectrum, \nbut also in the pattern of fluctuations in that spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions\\label{sec:Conclusion}}\n\n\nIn this paper, we studied the possibility that the properties of the dark sector\nare dominated by processes which are essentially random.\nWe considered a dark sector composed of an ensemble \nof $N$ individual \ncomponents\nwith differing masses, cosmological abundances, and couplings\nto the SM,\nand constructed a toy model in which the mass spectrum associated\nwith this ensemble is determined through an essentially random\nbreaking of an internal $SU(N)$ dark-sector symmetry.\nEven though this mass spectrum is determined randomly,\nwe were nevertheless\nable to bring the machinery of random-matrix theory to bear in order to\nderive predictions for the probability distribution of mass eigenvalues\nfor these component fields.  In this way, we were able to obtain a statistical prediction for a\ndensity-of-states function $n(m)$ \nfor the ensemble as a whole --- a prediction \nwhich grows more and more robust as the number $N$ of ensemble constituents increases.  \nMoreover, we found that this emergent density of states decreases as a function of mass and actually\nhas an upper limit $m_{\\rm max}$ beyond which $n(m)=0$ --- behavior which is quite unlike\nthe density-of-states functions for all other DDM ensembles which have previously been \ndiscussed in the literature.\n\nGiven these results for the dark-sector mass spectrum,\nwe then proceeded to demonstrate that \na set of corresponding cosmological abundances and decay widths for the \nensemble constituents can be generated via well-established mechanisms --- thermal \nfreeze-out and the controlled breaking of a stabilizing symmetry, respectively.\nWe then found that in scenarios of this sort, the fundamental scaling relations\nwhich govern the ensemble satisfy the basic criteria to be interpreted as potentially\nviable DDM ensembles --- ensembles in which cosmological abundances and decay widths satisfy\ncertain balancing relations across all constituents.\nThus, we were able to demonstrate that randomness in the dark sector coexists \nquite naturally with DDM.~\nFinally, we explored one possible observational signature of random DDM ensembles\nof this sort, namely the indirect detection of high-energy gamma rays produced \nfrom the decays of the ensemble constituents, and evaluated the prospects for the \ndetection of such signals.  \n\nThere are many ways in which the analysis of this paper might be generalized and extended.\nAs we have discussed in the Introduction,\nthere are three aspects of a dark-sector ensemble which are critical \nin determining the resulting phenomenology:\nthe spectrum of constituent masses, the spectrum of constituent cosmological abundances,\nand the spectrum of constituent decay widths into SM states.\nWhile the first of these describes the properties of the ensemble unto itself,\nthe second and third depend upon further information concerning how the ensemble \nemerges within a particular cosmological history\nand/or couples to SM states.\nIn this paper, we investigated the case in which only the first of these --- namely\nthe mass spectrum --- is determined randomly.\nIndeed, as have seen, the simple random mechanism which gives rise to\nthe density-of-states function for our ensemble is essentially unrelated to the \nphysics which determines the abundances and decay widths of the ensemble constituents.\n\nGiven this,\nwe may view our random mechanism as a fundamental ``kernel'' for establishing an\nensemble with a particular density-of-states function, a kernel which can be incorporated as\nan ingredient in any number of alternative scenarios.  As discussed in \nSect.~\\ref{sec:RandomMatrixGeneration}, the fact that the density of states for such\nensembles decreases with increasing $m$ implies that this ``kernel'' should be compatible\nwith a wide variety of scenarios for abundance and decay-width generation.  Indeed,\na broad class of models could be developed around ensembles of this sort  \nwhose detailed phenomenological implications might exhibit interesting and unanticipated characteristics.\nIt would also be interesting to explore further scenarios in which the\nmechanisms for generating cosmological abundances and SM decay widths  \nare themselves based on random processes.\n\nIt would also be interesting to consider more broadly the methods \nby which randomness in the dark sector might be detected.\nIdentifying characteristic features in the gamma-ray \nspectra of those statistical DDM ensembles,\nas we have discussed in Sect.~\\ref{sec:IndirectDet}, \nmay represent only one possible way of distinguishing\nbetween such ensembles experimentally.  Such ensembles clearly have a rich phenomenology\nand could potentially give rise to characteristic signals in the kinematic distributions\nof event-shape variables at colliders and as well as in distinctive recoil-energy spectra observed at\ndirect-detection experiments.\n\n\nFinally, near the end of Sect.~\\ref{sec:RandomMatrixGeneration},\nwe stated that a single universe can only exhibit one mass spectrum for the dark sector.\nIn other words, as stated there, we get only ``one roll of the dice''.\nOf course, there are certain situations in which this is not strictly true.  \nFor example, if the random effects which ultimately give rise to our dark-sector mass spectrum \nare associated with a first-order symmetry-breaking phase transition,\nthen different regions of spacetime could each correspond to their own distinct roll of the dice.\nLikewise, multiple rolls of the dice could also arise if we live a full-fledged multiverse,\nas recent developments in string theory suggest. \nThese questions are especially critical in the case of differing dark sectors\nbecause the dark sector carries a significant matter-based energy density and thus its properties play \na major role in the time evolution of the universe.\n\nIn either case, however, the end result would be\na series of different universes (or regions of spacetime) with different dark sectors,\neach existing within its own spatial domain and separated from the others \nby domain walls.   Such domain-wall topological defects would undoubtedly give rise to dramatic effects of their\nown, even beyond those associated with the properties of the different dark sectors they separate,\nand consequently there are tight phenomenological and astrophysical/cosmological\nconstraints that can already be placed on such scenarios coming from CMB anistropy limits\nand other energy-density constraints.\nHowever, if the only differences between the different universes are those that \nresult from different random throws of the \n$SU(N)$-breaking dice in the dark sector, then the $n_{\\rm SU(N)}$ probability distribution functions\nwe have discussed in this paper might have an even greater relevance \nthan we have imagined here, \nas averages across the entire universe or multiverse as a whole. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n\n\n\nWe would like to thank Jonathan Feng and Shrihari Gopalakrishna for useful discussions.\nKRD is supported in part by the Department of Energy under Grant DE-FG02-13ER41976\nand by the National Science Foundation\nthrough its employee IR/D program.
