We find that a minimal angular separation of $\\sim197^\\circ$ is predicted for orbits with small radial distances when the surface is void of a central mass.

Some of the interest in this topic can be attributed to fact that the orbital dynamics of an object on such a two-dimensional (2D) surface offers a non-trivial and interesting application of Lagrangian dynamics.  With the help of a camera capable of generating short video clips and one of the aforementioned surfaces, one can easily extend this theoretical study to the experimental domain.  This combined theoretical and experimental approach offers comprehensive undergraduate research possibilities as the relevant physics is accessible to any student who has taken an advanced dynamics course.\\cite{weller} \n\nPerhaps some of the interest in this topic arises from the fact that an orbiting body on a 2D surface is often used as a conceptual analogy when describing particle orbits about massive objects in general relativity.  In Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR), gravity is described as the warping of space and time due to the presence of matter and energy.  Although in Newtonian theory gravity is understood as the force of one massive object on another, in GR gravity emerges as a physical phenomenon due to the fact that a massive object warps the spacetime around it.   According to GR, the planets move along geodesics, or free-particle orbits, in the non-Euclidean geometry about the sun.  Hence, the planets move in their elliptical-like orbits aroung the sun not due to a `force' per se but rather due to the fact that the spacetime around the sun is curved by its presence.\n\nIn a typical introductory GR course, the spacetime external to a static, spherically-symmetric massive object is often extensively studied as it offers one of the simplest, exact solutions to the field equations of GR.  When geodesics about this object are then encountered, the conceptual analogy of a marble rolling on a taut elastic fabric warped by a massive compact object, such as a bowling ball, is often embraced in the discussion.   When the rolling marble is far from the massive object, the elastic fabric is flat and the marble moves in a straight line at a constant speed in agreement with Newton's first law.  When the rolling marble approaches the massive object, as the analogy goes, it moves in a curved path not due to a force acting on the marble, but rather due to the fact that the space in which it resides (the 2D surface) is warped by the object. \nThis analogy offers the student of GR a way of visualizing a warped spacetime and should not be confused with embedding diagrams.\\cite{embedding}  However, with this being said, it has been shown that there exists no 2D cylindrically-symmetric surface residing in a uniform gravitational field that can generate the exact Newtonian orbits of planetary motion, except for the special case of circular orbits.\\cite{English}  This null result was shown to hold when considering the fully general relativistic treatment of planetary orbits around non-rotating, spherically-symmetric  objects.\\cite{me2} \n\nWhite and Walker first explored marbles orbiting on a warped spandex surface by applying Newtonian mechanics to a marble residing on a cylindrically-symmetric spandex fabric subjected to a central mass.  There they arrived at an expression describing the approximate shape of the spandex surface and found that a marble orbiting upon this surface obeys the relation $T^3\\propto r^2$ for circular orbits in the small slope regime.  This fascinating result is highly reminiscent of Kepler's third law for planetary motion, but with the powers transposed.\\cite{GW}  Lemons and Lipscombe then showed that the shape of the spandex surface can equivalently be found by minimizing the total potential energy of the spandex fabric through the use of the calculus of variations.  The total potential energy considered includes the elastic potential energy of the spandex surface and the gravitational potential energy of the central mass.  The calculus of variations approach proves advantageous over the Newtonian treatment as the results of White and Walker emerge as a special case of a more general treatment, where a pre-stretch of the fabric can be included in the analysis.\\cite{DL}  This work was later expanded upon by Middleton and Langston, where the authors considered circular orbits on the spandex fabric in \\textit{both} the small and large slope regimes.  There they generalized the aforementioned calculus of variations treatment by including the previously-neglected gravitational potential energy of the spandex surface to the total potential energy of the spandex/central mass system.  They showed that the mass of the spandex fabric interior to the orbital path influences the motion of the marble and can even dominate the orbital characteristics.  They also showed that the modulus of elasticity of the spandex fabric is not constant and is itself a function of the stretch.\\cite{me2}  Later, Nauenberg considered precessing elliptical-like orbits with small eccentricities on cylindrically-symmetric funnels with various shape profiles.  By employing a perturbative method, an approximate solution to the orbital equation of motion was obtained where the precession parameter was found to be determined uniquely by the slope of the cylindrically-symmetric surface.\\cite{Nauenberg}  This perturbative method was then used to find the 2D surfaces that are capable of generating the stationary elliptical orbits of Newtonian gravitation and the precessing elliptical-like orbits of GR, for orbits with small eccentricities.\\cite{me}  Here, we're interested in understanding elliptical-like orbits of a marble on a warped spandex fabric.  \n\nOur paper is outlined as follows.  In Sec. \\ref{eqn}, we first consider the motion of a rolling marble on an arbitrary, cylindrically-symmetric surface and present the orbital equation of motion.  \nFor elliptical-like orbits with small eccentricities, we solve this equation of motion perturbatively and find a valid solution when the precession parameter obeys an algebraic relation involving the slope of the surface. We then present the equation that describes the slope of an elastic surface, which arises from minimizing the total potential energy of the spandex/central mass system.  In Sec. \\ref{orbits} and Sec. \\ref{orbits2}, we explore the elliptical-like orbits of the rolling marble in the small and large slope regimes, respectively.  We arrive at an expression describing the angular separation between successive like-apsides in each regime and compare with our experimental results.\\cite{apocenter}  Lastly, in Appendix \\ref{AdS}, we outline the general relativistic treatment of obtaining elliptical-like orbits with small eccentricities about a static, spherically-symmetric massive object in the presence of a vacuum energy.  After arriving at an expression describing the angular separation between successive like-apsides, we compare it to its counterpart for the marble on the spandex surface in both the small and large slope regimes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Elliptical-like orbits of a marble rolling on a cylindrically-symmetric elastic surface} \\label{eqn}\nWe begin this manuscript by presenting the equations of motion that describe a spherical marble of uniform mass density rolling on a cylindrically-symmetric surface in a uniform gravitational field.  These equations can be obtained by first constructing the Lagrangian that describes a rolling marble, which is constrained to reside upon a cylindrically-symmetric surface, in cylindrical coordinates $(r,\\phi,z)$.  This Lagrangian includes both the translational and rotational kinetic energy of the rolling marble and the gravitational potential energy of the orbiting body. The resultant Lagrangian can then be subjected to the Euler-Lagrange equations, which yield the equations of motion of the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n(1+z'^2)\\ddot{r}+z'z''\\dot{r}^2-r\\dot{\\phi}^2+\\frac{5}{7}gz'&=&0,\\label{roft}\\\\\n\\dot{\\phi}&=&\\frac{5\\ell}{7r^2},\\label{phi}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere a dot indicates a time-derivative, $z'\\equiv dz/dr$, and $\\ell$ is the conserved angular momentum per unit mass.\\cite{Marion} It is noted that these equations of motion have been derived in full detail elsewhere.\\cite{me2, English}   In arriving at Eqs. (\\ref{roft}) and (\\ref{phi}), it is noted that the scalar approximation for an object that rolls without slipping was employed.  A full vector treatment of the intrinsic angular momentum of a rolling object on a cylindrically-symmetric surface can be found elsewhere.\\cite{white}\n\nNotice that one can easily decouple the above differential equations by inserting Eq. (\\ref{phi}) into Eq. (\\ref{roft}).  The resulting differential equation can then be solved for $r(t)$, at least in principle, once the equation describing the cylindrically-symmetric surface, $z(r)$, is specified.  Here we are interested in arriving at an expression for the radial distance in terms of the azimuthal angle, $r(\\phi)$.  Using the chain rule and Eq. (\\ref{phi}), we construct a differential operator of the form\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{oper}\n\\frac{d}{dt}=\\frac{5\\ell}{7r^2}\\frac{d}{d\\phi}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{d}{dt}=\\frac{5\\ell}{7r^{2}}\\frac{d}{d\\phi}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2113</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>7</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03996.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis dynamical equation of motion describes the radial distance of the orbiting marble in terms of the azimuthal angle, for a given cylindrically-symmetric surface specified by $z(r)$, and equates to a non-linear differential equation that can be solved perturbatively.

Having an experimental value for $\\alpha$ is necessary as we wish to compare our predicted values for the angular separation between any successive like-apsides to the experimentally measured values. \n\nA camera capable of taking video clips at a rate of 60 frames per second was mounted above the spandex surface.  A plumb line, strung from the camera's perched location, was used to align the trampoline frame below and to determine the precise center of the fabric where the central mass should be placed.  A ramp was mounted near the perimeter of the trampoline and orientated in the tangential direction so elliptical-like orbits with varying eccentricities, and hence varying average radial distances, could be generated by simply varying the initial speed of the marble.  Several short video clips of elliptical-like orbits were then generated for a range of central masses and eccentricities.  The video clips were imported into Tracker,\\cite{Tracker} a video-analysis and modeling software program, where the marble's radial and angular coordinates could readily be extracted one frame at a time (see Fig. \\ref{fig:smallorbit}).  The apocenters and pericenters of the orbiting marble were identified by scrolling through the instantaneous radii and determining the maximum and minimum values, along with the accompanying angular coordinates. To remain within the small slope regime, only the first five orbits of a given run were considered, which yielded a maximum of ten data points per run.  These data were then imported into Excel for analysis.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=15cm]{Chad_MiddletonFig02.pdf}\n\\caption{Plot of the angular separation between two successive like-apsides, $\\Delta\\phi$, versus the average radial distance, $r_0$, of elliptical-like orbits in the small slope regime for central masses ranging from $M=0$ kg to $M=0.535$ kg. } \n\\label{fig:SmallSlope}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe angular separation between successive like-apsides could easily be obtained from the measured angular coordinates.  The average radial distance, $r_0$, was found by averaging over the measured instantaneous radii over one orbit; one data point was hence generated from these two quantities.  It is noted that the radius of a successive apocenter or pericenter was found to decrease (dramatically in the small slope regime) due to frictional losses and drag.  To account for this loss, the average radial distance of two successive apocenters or pericenters was calculated and used in the analysis in determining the eccentricity of an orbit.\\cite{eccentricity}  Elliptical-like orbits with eccentricities falling within the range of $0.15\\leq\\varepsilon<0.35$ were kept for analysis whereas orbits with eccentricities outside of this adopted range were systematically discarded.\n\nUsing our aforementioned measured value of $\\alpha$, the theoretical curves of the angular separation between successive like-apsides, as described by Eq. (\\ref{smallsol}), can be plotted versus the average radial distances, $r_0$, of an elliptical-like orbit for a given central mass.  These theoretical curves can then be compared to the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$, both are collectively displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig:SmallSlope}.  \n\nUpon examination of Fig. \\ref{fig:SmallSlope}, notice that the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$ tend to reside below the theoretical curves, with larger discrepancies occurring for smaller central masses.  The authors hypothesize that this is predominantly due to an increased frictional loss for an orbiting marble about smaller central masses.  As the central mass decreases, the stretching of the spandex fabric decreases, and the warping of the spandex fabric due to the orbiting marble's weight increases.  This generates a scenario were the marble is having to effectively climb out of its own gravitational well, more so then for a larger central mass, and encounters an increased frictional loss resulting in the marble reaching its apocenter earlier than it would without this loss.  This can be compared to 2D projectile motion where the projectile is subjected to a retarding force.  For a projectile subjected to a large retarding force, one finds that it reaches a smaller peak height in a shorter horizontal distance than it would for a smaller retarding force.  Further note that the measured values for $\\Delta\\phi$ tend to increase for increasing average radial distance for zero central mass and decrease for increasing average radial distances for non-zero central mass, inline with the theoretical predictions.  \n\nIn the next section, we explore the behavior of the angular separation between successive apocenters in the large slope regime.  We find that within this regime,  the angular separation takes on values \\textit{greater than} 360$^\\circ$ for very small radial distances and large central masses.  This corresponds to the apsides marching forward in the azimuthal direction over successive orbits.  Interestingly, elliptical-like orbits around non-rotating, spherically-symmetric massive objects in general relativity are also found to have angular separations between successive like-apsides taking on values greater than 360$^\\circ$.  A comparison between these GR orbits and the orbits on a spandex fabric will be discussed in the appendix. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Elliptical-like orbits in the large slope regime}\\label{orbits2}\nWe now wish to explore the behavior of the angular separation between successive apocenters in the large slope regime.  This regime corresponds physically to the region deep inside the well, namely, on the spandex fabric where $r_0$ is small, when a large central mass has been placed upon the surface.  In this large slope regime, where $z'\\gg 1$, we can again expand the square root in the denominator of Eq. (\\ref{shape}) by first pulling $z'$ out of the square root and then expanding in powers of $1/z'^2$.  Keeping only the lowest-order contribution in this expression and then solving Eq.

Having an experimental value for $\\alpha$ is necessary as we wish to compare our predicted values for the angular separation between any successive like-apsides to the experimentally measured values. \n\nA camera capable of taking video clips at a rate of 60 frames per second was mounted above the spandex surface.  A plumb line, strung from the camera's perched location, was used to align the trampoline frame below and to determine the precise center of the fabric where the central mass should be placed.  A ramp was mounted near the perimeter of the trampoline and orientated in the tangential direction so elliptical-like orbits with varying eccentricities, and hence varying average radial distances, could be generated by simply varying the initial speed of the marble.  Several short video clips of elliptical-like orbits were then generated for a range of central masses and eccentricities.  The video clips were imported into Tracker,\\cite{Tracker} a video-analysis and modeling software program, where the marble's radial and angular coordinates could readily be extracted one frame at a time (see Fig. \\ref{fig:smallorbit}).  The apocenters and pericenters of the orbiting marble were identified by scrolling through the instantaneous radii and determining the maximum and minimum values, along with the accompanying angular coordinates. To remain within the small slope regime, only the first five orbits of a given run were considered, which yielded a maximum of ten data points per run.  These data were then imported into Excel for analysis.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=15cm]{Chad_MiddletonFig02.pdf}\n\\caption{Plot of the angular separation between two successive like-apsides, $\\Delta\\phi$, versus the average radial distance, $r_0$, of elliptical-like orbits in the small slope regime for central masses ranging from $M=0$ kg to $M=0.535$ kg. } \n\\label{fig:SmallSlope}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe angular separation between successive like-apsides could easily be obtained from the measured angular coordinates.  The average radial distance, $r_0$, was found by averaging over the measured instantaneous radii over one orbit; one data point was hence generated from these two quantities.  It is noted that the radius of a successive apocenter or pericenter was found to decrease (dramatically in the small slope regime) due to frictional losses and drag.  To account for this loss, the average radial distance of two successive apocenters or pericenters was calculated and used in the analysis in determining the eccentricity of an orbit.\\cite{eccentricity}  Elliptical-like orbits with eccentricities falling within the range of $0.15\\leq\\varepsilon<0.35$ were kept for analysis whereas orbits with eccentricities outside of this adopted range were systematically discarded.\n\nUsing our aforementioned measured value of $\\alpha$, the theoretical curves of the angular separation between successive like-apsides, as described by Eq. (\\ref{smallsol}), can be plotted versus the average radial distances, $r_0$, of an elliptical-like orbit for a given central mass.  These theoretical curves can then be compared to the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$, both are collectively displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig:SmallSlope}.  \n\nUpon examination of Fig. \\ref{fig:SmallSlope}, notice that the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$ tend to reside below the theoretical curves, with larger discrepancies occurring for smaller central masses.  The authors hypothesize that this is predominantly due to an increased frictional loss for an orbiting marble about smaller central masses.  As the central mass decreases, the stretching of the spandex fabric decreases, and the warping of the spandex fabric due to the orbiting marble's weight increases.  This generates a scenario were the marble is having to effectively climb out of its own gravitational well, more so then for a larger central mass, and encounters an increased frictional loss resulting in the marble reaching its apocenter earlier than it would without this loss.  This can be compared to 2D projectile motion where the projectile is subjected to a retarding force.  For a projectile subjected to a large retarding force, one finds that it reaches a smaller peak height in a shorter horizontal distance than it would for a smaller retarding force.  Further note that the measured values for $\\Delta\\phi$ tend to increase for increasing average radial distance for zero central mass and decrease for increasing average radial distances for non-zero central mass, inline with the theoretical predictions.  \n\nIn the next section, we explore the behavior of the angular separation between successive apocenters in the large slope regime.  We find that within this regime,  the angular separation takes on values \\textit{greater than} 360$^\\circ$ for very small radial distances and large central masses.  This corresponds to the apsides marching forward in the azimuthal direction over successive orbits.  Interestingly, elliptical-like orbits around non-rotating, spherically-symmetric massive objects in general relativity are also found to have angular separations between successive like-apsides taking on values greater than 360$^\\circ$.  A comparison between these GR orbits and the orbits on a spandex fabric will be discussed in the appendix. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Elliptical-like orbits in the large slope regime}\\label{orbits2}\nWe now wish to explore the behavior of the angular separation between successive apocenters in the large slope regime.

In this large slope regime, where $z'\\gg 1$, we can again expand the square root in the denominator of Eq.

As here we wish to probe small radial distances for large central masses, we positioned a small spherical object of radius $\\sim1.5$ cm in the center of the fabric.

Notice that as the average radial distance decreases, the angular separation increases.  The horizontal dashed line displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig:LargeSlope} corresponds to $\\Delta\\phi=360^\\circ$.  Hence, for data points lying above this line, the apocenter marched forward in the azimuthal direction when compared to that of the previous orbits. \n\nWe note that when the average radial distances of the elliptical-like orbits were greater than $\\sim10$ cm, the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$ were found to become substantially smaller than those shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:LargeSlope}.  As our theoretical prediction for $\\Delta\\phi$ is only valid in the large slope regime, we neglected the data points beyond this radial distance.  For radial distances smaller than $\\sim3$ cm, the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$ were found to be quite sporadic.  For orbits with small average radial distances, the angular velocity becomes quite large and hence only a handful of particle locations are imaged ($\\sim12$) for a given orbit; this yields an angular separation of $\\sim30^\\circ$ between imaged locations and gives rise to a fairly large uncertainty in the angular measurement.

We found that a minimal angular separation of $\\sim197^\\circ$ was predicted for orbits with small radial distances when the surface is void of a central mass.  We also showed that for a marble orbiting with a small radius about a large central mass, corresponding to when the marble is deep within the well, the angular separation between successive like-apsides takes on values greater than 360$^\\circ$.  For these orbits, successive apocenters `march forward' in the azimuthal direction in the orbital plane, reminiscent of particle orbits about spherically-symmetric massive objects as described by general relativity.  These theoretical predictions were shown to be consistent with the experimental measurements.\n\nAlthough the orbital characteristics of a marble on a warped spandex fabric fundamentally differ from those of particle orbits about a spherically-symmetric massive object as described by general relativity, the authors contend that embracing the conceptual analogy between the two is insightful for the student of GR.  Hence, this proposed theoretical/experimental undergraduate research project can be extended into the realm of general relativity, where a study of the elliptical-like orbits about a spherically-symmetric massive object with small eccentricities can be compared and contrasted to the theoretical work contained within this manuscript.\n\nIn the appendix, we study the physics of the analogy and find that some striking similarities exist between these elliptical-like orbits.  Although differing in functional form, we show that the angular separation between like-apsides for marbles orbiting in the large slope regime and for particles orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit both diverge for vanishingly small radial distances in a somewhat similar manner.  We also show that the areal mass density of the spandex fabric plays the role of the vacuum energy density in GR, in regards to their competing relationship with their respective central mass, in the expressions for the angular separation.\n\n\n\n\\begin{appendix}\n\n\\section{Elliptical-like orbits with small eccentricities in general relativity}\\label{AdS}\nIn this section, we outline the general relativistic treatment of obtaining elliptical-like orbits with small eccentricities about a spherically-symmetric massive object in the presence of a constant vacuum energy density, or equivalently, a cosmological constant.  We arrive at the necessary conditions for elliptical-like orbits to occur in this spacetime and compare and contrast the expression for the angular separation between consecutive like-apsides to that obtained for a rolling marble on the warped spandex fabric in \\textit{both} the small and large slope regimes.  Although these expressions differ in their functional forms, there are some striking similarities.  Here we argue that a thorough study of the physics of the analogy, a marble orbiting on a spandex surface, can aid in the learning of free particle orbits, or geodesics, in general relativity.\n\nThe addition of the cosmological constant to the field equations of general relativity can be traced back to Einstein himself.  One of his first applications of this new theory of gravitation, which describes gravity as the warping of space and time due to the presence of matter and energy, was to the field of cosmology.  Einstein added the cosmological constant to the relativistic equations only after realizing that these equations fail to offer a static cosmological solution to describe the seemingly static universe of his time.  When the universe was later discovered to be expanding, the cosmological constant became an unnecessary addition and Einstein missed the opportunity of predicting an expanding universe, as his cosmological constant-free equations seemed to be implying.  With the much later discovery of a late-time \\textit{accelerated} expansion of the universe, the importance of a cosmological constant has once again arisen, but with the cosmological constant now recast into the form of a vacuum energy density.  Mathematically, a cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$, which finds itself on the curvature side of the field equations of GR, can be equivalently reformulated into a constant vacuum energy density, $\\rho_0$, which resides on the matter/energy side.  These quantities are related through the algebraic relation\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 34266, "prevtext": "\nNotice that when $\\alpha M/r_0>\\sqrt{2}$, Eq.

By orientating our camera to obtain a side view of the fabric's surface, we subjected our spandex fabric to the same range of central masses used in generating particle orbits in this large slope regime.  We then imported this video of the shape profile of the spandex fabric into Tracker and measured the heights of the fabric at the aforementioned fixed radius as a function of the central mass $M$.  \nThe slope of this best fit line yields a value of $\\alpha=0.0049$ m/kg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experimental setup and procedure for probing the large slope regime of the spandex fabric was quite similar to that of the small slope regime, with a few notable exceptions.  As here we wish to probe small radial distances for large central masses, we positioned a small spherical object of radius $\\sim1.5$ cm in the center of the fabric.  A sling, capable of supporting several kilograms of mass, was fashioned and fastened to the spherical object from below the fabric with the help of an adjustable pipe clamp.  This setup allowed us to probe a range of large central masses while maintaining a constant diameter circular well.\n\nThe average radii of successive orbits do not decrease as drastically when the orbiting body is deep within the well as compared to orbits in the small slope regime, hence many orbits can potentially be analyzed for any given run.  The angular separations, $\\Delta\\phi$, were found and the corresponding average radial distances, $r_0$, were obtained.  Again, ellliptical-like orbits with eccentricities found to lie within the range $0.15\\leq\\varepsilon<0.35$ were kept and further analyzed, those not in this defined range were systematically discarded.\n\nUsing our experimentally determined value of $\\alpha=0.0049$ m/kg, the theoretical curves of the angular separation, $\\Delta\\phi$, described by Eq. (\\ref{largesol}), can be plotted versus the average radial distance, $r_0$, of an elliptical-like orbit for a given central mass along with the measured values and are collectively displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig:LargeSlope}.  Notice that as the average radial distance decreases, the angular separation increases.  The horizontal dashed line displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig:LargeSlope} corresponds to $\\Delta\\phi=360^\\circ$.  Hence, for data points lying above this line, the apocenter marched forward in the azimuthal direction when compared to that of the previous orbits. \n\nWe note that when the average radial distances of the elliptical-like orbits were greater than $\\sim10$ cm, the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$ were found to become substantially smaller than those shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:LargeSlope}.  As our theoretical prediction for $\\Delta\\phi$ is only valid in the large slope regime, we neglected the data points beyond this radial distance.  For radial distances smaller than $\\sim3$ cm, the measured values of $\\Delta\\phi$ were found to be quite sporadic.  For orbits with small average radial distances, the angular velocity becomes quite large and hence only a handful of particle locations are imaged ($\\sim12$) for a given orbit; this yields an angular separation of $\\sim30^\\circ$ between imaged locations and gives rise to a fairly large uncertainty in the angular measurement.  Here we display the data points with average radial distances $3.0\\;\\mbox{cm}\\leq r_0\\leq 10\\;\\mbox{cm}$.\n\n\n\\section{conclusion}\nIn this manuscript, we arrived at expressions describing the angular separation between successive like-apsides for a marble rolling on a cylindrically-symmetric spandex surface in a uniform gravitational field in both the small and large slope regimes. We found that a minimal angular separation of $\\sim197^\\circ$ was predicted for orbits with small radial distances when the surface is void of a central mass.  We also showed that for a marble orbiting with a small radius about a large central mass, corresponding to when the marble is deep within the well, the angular separation between successive like-apsides takes on values greater than 360$^\\circ$.  For these orbits, successive apocenters `march forward' in the azimuthal direction in the orbital plane, reminiscent of particle orbits about spherically-symmetric massive objects as described by general relativity.  These theoretical predictions were shown to be consistent with the experimental measurements.\n\nAlthough the orbital characteristics of a marble on a warped spandex fabric fundamentally differ from those of particle orbits about a spherically-symmetric massive object as described by general relativity, the authors contend that embracing the conceptual analogy between the two is insightful for the student of GR.  Hence, this proposed theoretical/experimental undergraduate research project can be extended into the realm of general relativity, where a study of the elliptical-like orbits about a spherically-symmetric massive object with small eccentricities can be compared and contrasted to the theoretical work contained within this manuscript.\n\nIn the appendix, we study the physics of the analogy and find that some striking similarities exist between these elliptical-like orbits.  Although differing in functional form, we show that the angular separation between like-apsides for marbles orbiting in the large slope regime and for particles orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit both diverge for vanishingly small radial distances in a somewhat similar manner.  We also show that the areal mass density of the spandex fabric plays the role of the vacuum energy density in GR, in regards to their competing relationship with their respective central mass, in the expressions for the angular separation.\n\n\n\n\\begin{appendix}\n\n\\section{Elliptical-like orbits with small eccentricities in general relativity}\\label{AdS}\nIn this section, we outline the general relativistic treatment of obtaining elliptical-like orbits with small eccentricities about a spherically-symmetric massive object in the presence of a constant vacuum energy density, or equivalently, a cosmological constant.  We arrive at the necessary conditions for elliptical-like orbits to occur in this spacetime and compare and contrast the expression for the angular separation between consecutive like-apsides to that obtained for a rolling marble on the warped spandex fabric in \\textit{both} the small and large slope regimes.  Although these expressions differ in their functional forms, there are some striking similarities.  Here we argue that a thorough study of the physics of the analogy, a marble orbiting on a spandex surface, can aid in the learning of free particle orbits, or geodesics, in general relativity.\n\nThe addition of the cosmological constant to the field equations of general relativity can be traced back to Einstein himself.  One of his first applications of this new theory of gravitation, which describes gravity as the warping of space and time due to the presence of matter and energy, was to the field of cosmology.  Einstein added the cosmological constant to the relativistic equations only after realizing that these equations fail to offer a static cosmological solution to describe the seemingly static universe of his time.  When the universe was later discovered to be expanding, the cosmological constant became an unnecessary addition and Einstein missed the opportunity of predicting an expanding universe, as his cosmological constant-free equations seemed to be implying.  With the much later discovery of a late-time \\textit{accelerated} expansion of the universe, the importance of a cosmological constant has once again arisen, but with the cosmological constant now recast into the form of a vacuum energy density.  Mathematically, a cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$, which finds itself on the curvature side of the field equations of GR, can be equivalently reformulated into a constant vacuum energy density, $\\rho_0$, which resides on the matter/energy side.  These quantities are related through the algebraic relation\n\n", "index": 29, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{rholambda}\n\\rho_0=(c^2/8\\pi G)\\Lambda, \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\rho_{0}=(c^{2}/8\\pi G)\\Lambda,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>/</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03996.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\tau$ is the proper time.

These vacuum fluctuations give rise to a nonzero vacuum energy density.  It is noted that the cosmological constant, and therefore the constant vacuum energy density, can be of either sign.  Observational evidence, however, suggests that we live in a universe with a small but nonzero, \\textit{positive} vacuum energy density \nwhose presence is needed to explain the observed accelerated expansion of the universe.  \n\nUsing the Schwarzschild coordinates $(t,r,\\theta,\\phi)$, the equations of motion describing an object of mass $m$ orbiting about a non-rotating, spherically symmetric massive object of mass $M$, in the presence of a cosmological constant, in general relativity are of the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\ddot{r}+\\frac{GM}{r^2}-\\frac{\\ell^2}{r^3}+\\frac{3GM\\ell^2}{c^2r^4}-\\frac{1}{3}\\Lambda c^2r&=&0,\\label{releq}\\\\\n\\dot{\\phi}&=&\\frac{\\ell}{r^2}\\label{relphi},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere in this section a dot indicates a derivative with respect to proper time and $\\ell$ is the conserved angular momentum per unit mass.\\cite{Stuchlik,Hackmann,Cruz}  \n\nIt is noted that the last two terms in Eq. (\\ref{releq}) correspond to relativistic terms which are not present in Newtonian gravitation.  By setting these two relativistic terms equal to zero, one obtains the equations of motion of Newtonian theory; these yield a solution for the radial distance that describes orbits that equate to the conic sections.\\cite{conic}  The $1/r^4$ term equates to a general relativistic correction term to Newtonian gravitation, present even for a vanishing cosmological constant,  and offers a small-$r$ modification to Newtonian theory.  This correction term demands that the closed elliptical orbits of Newtonian theory are replaced with precessing elliptical-like orbits, which will become apparent in the paragraphs that follow.  For a nonzero cosmological constant, notice that the last term in Eq. (\\ref{releq}) offers a large-$r$ modification to the orbits.\n\nAs in our treatment of elliptical-like orbits on a warped spandex surface, we are interested in obtaining the solution for the radial distance of the orbiting body in terms of the azimuthal angle.
