(1) and the Fourier transform of Eq. (2), respectively [Fig. 3(a)].\nThe respective MSSW and MSBVW modes show approximately linear and flat dispersion\nin the region of  $k < 6$ ${\\rm rad/\\mu m}$, where the Fourier transform of $h_{\\rm exc, \\it Y}$ has finite strength.\nSpin-waves with the $\\mbox{\\boldmath $k$}$ vector in this region are excited in-phase at $t=0$ \nand then form the wave-packet propagating away from the origin.\nThe excitation source, {i.e.,} $h_{\\rm exc, \\it Y}$, is symmetric in space but the spin-wave dispersion is highly anisotropic,\nso that the spin-wave directionally propagates, as mentioned above. \n\nThe observed $\\Delta \\varphi _{\\rm K}$ value may be proportional to the normal component $\\delta m_z (r, t)$, \nwhich can be computed by taking account of the finite radius of the probe beam spot:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&& \\Delta \\varphi_{\\rm K}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$},t) \\propto \\iint \\delta m_z (\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$}-\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$}^{\\prime },t) G_{\\rm probe}(\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$}^{\\prime })d^2r^{\\prime }, \\label{eq:obs} \\\\\n&& \\delta m_z (\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$},t)=\\delta m_Y (\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$},t)\\sin \\theta _{\\rm M} + \\delta m_Z (\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$},t) \\cos \\theta _{\\rm M}, \\label{eq:dmz}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $G_{\\rm probe}$ in Eq. (\\ref{eq:obs}) denotes Gaussian intensity distribution of probe beam, first and second terms in Eq. (\\ref{eq:dmz}) correspond to the oscillating component and the reduction of magnetization, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculated $x$-$t$ mapping of $\\Delta \\varphi_{\\rm K}$ is also shown in Fig. 3(b).\nThe data agrees well with the experimental data shown in Fig. 2(c).\nThe calculated data of the $y$-$t$ mapping of $\\Delta \\varphi_{\\rm K}$ did not show a propagating spin-wave pattern (not shown here),\nwhich was also consistent with experimental results.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm,keepaspectratio,clip]{Fig4.eps}\n\\caption{Logarithmic amplitude (a), group velocity $v_{\\rm g}$ (b), frequency $f_0$ (c), packet width $\\sigma $ (d), and initial phase $\\phi _0$ (e) of the spin-wave obtained from the fitting as a function of the distance between the pump and probe positions.

The solid curve indicates the calculated result.}\n\\label{f4}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to quantitatively compare the calculated and experimental data,\nthe theoretical and experimental values of $\\Delta \\varphi_{\\rm K}$ corresponding to the spin-wave packet were analyzed \nusing the fitting of the Gaussian wave-packet:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta \\varphi_{\\rm K}(x,t)&=&A \\exp \\left[ \\frac{\\left( v_{\\rm g}t-x\\right) ^2}{2\\sigma ^2}\\right] \\sin \\left( 2\\pi f_0 t -\\phi _0 \\right). \\label{eq:fit}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $A$, $v_{\\rm g}$, and $\\sigma $ are the amplitude, group velocity, and packet width, respectively, of a Gaussian envelope,\nand $f_0$ and $\\phi _0$ are the center frequency and phase of the spin-wave, respectively, for a sinusoidal function.\nGenerally, a spin-wave packet generated by a pulse magnetic field forms a shape slightly deviated from the Gaussian wave-packet \\cite{Wu},\nwhereas the measured wave-packets are approximately fitted by Eq. (\\ref{eq:fit}), as shown in Fig. 2(a) with a broken curve. \nThe full set of quantities obtained from the experimental and theoretical data are shown in Fig. 4 \nwith circles and solid curves, respectively.\nThe experimental values agree well with the theoretical data within acceptable errors.\n\nThe propagation length, $\\lambda $, of the spin-wave was evaluated to be 3.5 $\\pm $ 0.1 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ from the data in Fig. 4(a),\nwhich is relatively shorter than the values reported in a permalloy thin films.\nThe $\\lambda $ value may be simply connected to $v_{\\rm g}$ and the relaxation time of the spin-wave, $\\tau $, by the relation $\\lambda = v_{\\rm g} \\tau $.\nWhen the Gilbert damping is the main loss mechanism, \nthe $\\tau $ value is roughly estimated by the relation $\\tau  \\sim 1/ 2 \\pi \\alpha f_0 P$, where $\\alpha $ and $P$ are the Gilbert damping constant and the precession ellipticity factor, respectively.\nThe $v_{\\rm g}$ and $f_0$ values evaluated from the experiment are roughly independent of $x$ and are about 4 km/s and 5.5 $\\sim $ 5.9 GHz, respectively [Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)]. The $P$ value was calculated to be $\\sim $ 2.6.\nThese values yield $\\tau \\sim$ 1.6 ns and $\\lambda = 6.4$ $\\mu$m with the experimental $\\alpha$ of 0.0071\n being approximately consistent with the-above-mentioned $\\lambda$ values. \nThe packet width, $\\sigma$, is $\\sim$1 $\\mu$m [Figs. 4(d)], \nwhich is comparable to the width of the effective excitation field in $k$-space [Fig. 3(a)].\nThe center wave-number, $k_0$, for the generated spin-wave can be roughly \nevaluated to be 0.8 $\\sim $ 1.0 rad/$\\mu $m by the slope, {\\it i.e.,} $\\phi_0 = k_0 x$, from the data in Fig. 4(e). \nThe values of $f_0$ and $v_{\\rm g}$ ($=2\\pi df/dk$) at $k_0$ for the spin-wave dispersion in the film, as shown in Fig. 3(a) by the vertical broken line, \nalso accord with the values shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c), respectively. \n\nThe above discussion allows us to conclude that the primary origin of the coherent spin-wave generated by the focused pulse laser in permalloy films\nis the local modulation of the out-of-plane demagnetization field, {\\it i.e.,} Eq. (2).\nHowever, Eq. (2) is a rather naive approximation of the effective magnetic field.\nAnother contribution resulting from the local reduction of magnetization is the effective magnetic field stemming from magnetic charges along the rim of the pump laser-focused spot.\nThis has a spatial symmetry different from that expressed by Eq. (2) and results in an antisymmetric spin-wave emission with respect to the magnetization direction, \nas suggested by the theoretical simulation by Au {\\it et al.} \\cite{Au}.\nThe phase of the spin-wave observed in this study is close to symmetric [Fig. 2(b)],\nso that the effect of such contributions may be ruled out by the result observed here.\nThe phenomenon should be investigated in more detail by means of a two-dimensional imaging of the spin-wave propagation, with the simulation taking a more correct derivation of Eq.(2) into account using the Poisson equation, or more generally, Maxwell's equations with the metal's finite conductivity,\nwhich will be addressed as a next step. \n\nIn conclusion, we have investigated an ultrashort laser pulse-induced propagating spin-wave in a 20-nm-thick permalloy film. \nThe propagating spin-wave packet was clearly observed in the case where the propagation direction was perpendicular to the magnetization direction. \nVarious quantities that characterize the propagating spin-wave were experimentally evaluated, and those were quantitatively well-explained by the theoretical model\nin which the propagating spin-wave was excited by the out-of-plane demagnetization field with a Gaussian intensity distribution that was induced by the focused pulse laser.\n\nThis  work  was  partially  supported  by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Nano Spin Conversion Science, No. 26103004)\nand the WPI-AIMR fusion research project.\nS.

\nthis is an unique property in metallic magnets, from which it follows that  the scenario of spin-wave generation by a pulse laser may differ between metals and insulators.\n\nIn this letter, we report a clear observation of the propagation of a spin-wave packet created by an ultrashort laser pulse in a permalloy thin film by means of the space- and time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (STR-MOKE).\nThe observed propagation of a spin-wave generated by a laser pulse is {\\it quantitatively} explained by a theoretical model taking account of the ultrafast change of the out-of-plane demagnetization field induced by the laser pulse with a Gaussian distribution in space.\n\nThe STR-MOKE measurements were performed by a standard, all-optical pump-probe set-up with the two-color method [Fig. 1(a)]. \nThe source of the pulse was a Ti: Sapphire laser with a wavelength, pulse width, and pulse repetition rate of $\\sim$800 nm, $\\sim$120 fs, and $\\sim$80 MHz, respectively.\nA BaB$_2$O$_4$ (BBO) crystal was used for the frequency-doubling of the pump laser. \nThen, the pump laser amplitude was modulated using a mechanical chopper with a modulation frequency at 370 Hz.\nBoth the probe and the pump laser with linear-polarization were focused onto a sample by the objective lens with $NA=0.65$ via a scanning mirror by which \nthe spot position of the probe laser beam on the sample can be changed by changing the angle of the mirror.\nThe spot radius of the probe laser beam ($\\sigma _{\\rm probe}$), {\\it i.e.,} the half-width at which the light intensity becomes $e^{-0.5}$, \nwas evaluated to be 0.51 ${\\rm \\mu m}$ using the knife-edge method \\cite{Araujo}. \nThe intensity of the pump laser beam at the focused area approximated to a Gaussian function with radius ($\\sigma _{\\rm pump}$) was evaluated to be 0.50 $\\mu$m \\cite{Sup}; the fluence of the pump laser pulse was estimated to be several mJ/cm$^2$.\nThe spot position of the probe laser beam on the sample was scanned along the direction perpendicular ($x$-axis) or parallel ($y$-axis) to the in-plane component of the magnetization $\\mbox{\\boldmath $M$}$ [Fig. 1(b)].\nThe pump laser pulse-induced change in the Kerr rotation angle of the reflected probe laser pulse ($\\Delta \\varphi _{\\rm K}$) was detected by a balanced photo-diode detector and a lock-in amplifier,\nand the output voltage was then recorded as a function of the pump-probe delay time and distance.\nDuring the measurements, a magnetic field $\\mbox{\\boldmath $H$}_{\\rm ext}$ of 3 kOe  with a field angle of $\\sim$5$^{\\circ }$ from the normal of the sample plane ($z$-axis) was externally applied by a permanent magnet to the sample.\nThe sample consists of a 20-nm-thick permalloy (Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) film deposited onto a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate by ultra-high  vacuum magnetron sputtering.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.2cm,keepaspectratio,clip]{Fig1.eps}\n\\caption{Schematic illustration of (a) the optical set-up for the space- and time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect \nand (b) the coordinate system. \nThe probe beam spot was scanned along the direction perpendicular ($x$ direction) or parallel ($y$ direction) to the in-plane component of \nthe magnetization unit vector, $\\mbox{\\boldmath $M$}$.\nBoth  $\\mbox{\\boldmath $M$}$ and the external magnetic field vector $\\mbox{\\boldmath $H$}_{\\rm ext}$ are in the $y-z$ plane.\nThe directions of $\\mbox{\\boldmath $H$}_{\\rm ext}$ and $\\mbox{\\boldmath $M$}$ are defined by the angles $\\theta _{\\rm H}$ and $\\theta _{\\rm M}$ with respect to a film normal, respectively.\n$\\delta m_{\\rm Z}$ and $\\delta m_{\\rm Y}$ correspond to small changes in the parallel and perpendicular components of $\\mbox{\\boldmath $M$}$, respectively, in an $X-Y-Z$ coordinate system that is defined by the rotation of the $x-y-z$ coordinate system about the $x$-axis.  \n}\n\\label{f1}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,keepaspectratio,clip]{Fig2.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Change in the Kerr rotation angle $\\Delta \\varphi _{\\rm K}$ as a function of time at $x$ = 0 $\\mu $m (pump-probe overlap) (a) and $x$ = -3.1 $\\mu $m (b).

\nthus, the observed spin-wave packet may be attributed to that of the MSSW created by a laser pulse.\nIn order to confirm this speculation, quantitative analysis is necessary with the magnetostatic spin-wave dispersion relation and the details of the laser-induced spin-wave generation mechanism taken into account.\nThis is because the nature of the spin-wave observed should depend on its average frequency and wave number, \nwhich are determined by the dispersion relation and the wave number-dependent stimulus by the pulse laser.\n\nThe coherent spin-wave generated by a pulse laser may be described by linear response theory based on the linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation taking account of the magnetostatic interaction with a thin film limit (see the details of the calculation in the Supplementary Materials\\cite{Sup}) :\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n{\\small\n\\delta m_i (\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$},t) = \\iint  \\tilde{\\chi }_{ij} (\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$}-\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$}^{\\prime },t-t^{\\prime })h_{\\rm exc,  \\it j} (\\mbox{\\boldmath $r$}^{\\prime },t^{\\prime }) d^2r^{\\prime }dt.\n} \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\small\\delta m_{i}(\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$},t)=\\iint\\tilde{\\chi}_{ij}(\\mbox{%&#10;\\boldmath$r$}-\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}^{\\prime},t-t^{\\prime})h_{\\rm exc,\\it j}(%&#10;\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}^{\\prime},t^{\\prime})d^{2}r^{\\prime}dt.}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathsize=\"90%\">\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathsize=\"90%\">m</mi><mi mathsize=\"90%\">i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"90%\" minsize=\"90%\">(</mo><mi mathsize=\"90%\">\ud835\udc93</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">,</mo><mi mathsize=\"90%\">t</mi><mo maxsize=\"90%\" minsize=\"90%\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">=</mo><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\iint</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi mathsize=\"90%\">\u03c7</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">~</mo></mover><mrow><mi mathsize=\"90%\">i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathsize=\"90%\">j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"90%\" minsize=\"90%\">(</mo><mrow><mi mathsize=\"90%\">\ud835\udc93</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">-</mo><msup><mi mathsize=\"90%\">\ud835\udc93</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">\u2032</mo></msup></mrow><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">,</mo><mrow><mi mathsize=\"90%\">t</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">-</mo><msup><mi mathsize=\"90%\">t</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">\u2032</mo></msup></mrow><mo maxsize=\"90%\" minsize=\"90%\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathsize=\"90%\">h</mi><mrow><mi mathsize=\"90%\">exc</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">,</mo><mi mathsize=\"90%\">j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"90%\" minsize=\"90%\">(</mo><msup><mi mathsize=\"90%\">\ud835\udc93</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">\u2032</mo></msup><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">,</mo><msup><mi mathsize=\"90%\">t</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">\u2032</mo></msup><mo maxsize=\"90%\" minsize=\"90%\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathsize=\"90%\">d</mi><mn mathsize=\"90%\">2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathsize=\"90%\">r</mi><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">\u2032</mo></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathsize=\"90%\">d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathsize=\"90%\">t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo mathsize=\"90%\" stretchy=\"false\">.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
