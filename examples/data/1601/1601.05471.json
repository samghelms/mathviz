This is larger than the maximal\npossible CP-violating asymmetry associated with the CP-violating\nphase, \\deltacp, of the three-flavor PMNS mixing matrix in the region of\nthe peak flux. The CP asymmetry is larger in the energy regions below the peak\nflux while the matter asymmetry is smaller. As a result, the LBNF\nwide-band beam will allow unambiguous determination of both the MH and\n\\deltacp with high confidence \\textit{within the same experiment}, i.e., DUNE. \nThe DUNE science reach is described in detail in \\volphys, where it is presented \nin terms of  exposure expressed in units of \\ktMWyr{}.\n\nFor instance, seven years of data\n(\\num{3.5} years in neutrino mode plus \\num{3.5} years in antineutrino\nmode\\footnote{unless otherwise stated, the results presented in the CDR assume equal running in neutrino and antineutrino mode.}) with a \\ktadj{40} detector and a \\MWadj{1.07} beam (based on a \\GeVadj{80} primary proton beam) correspond to an\nexposure of \\SI{300}~\\ktMWyr. \n\n\nThe DUNE far detector will be built as four \\ktadj{10} modules, which will\ncome online sequentially over the course of several years, as described in Chapter~\\ref{ch:project-overview}. \nThis staged program enables an early scientific output from DUNE, \ninitially focused on the observation of natural\nsources of neutrinos, searches for nucleon decays and \nmeasurements of backgrounds. \nAbout a year after commissioning the first detector module, \nthe LBNF neutrino\nbeam at Fermilab will \nbegin sending neutrinos over the \\kmadj{1300}\nbaseline, commencing the LBL oscillation physics program with a beam power of up to \\SI{1.2}\\MW{}. \nPrior to the operation of the near detector (ND), which\nis likely to start after the initial beam running, the early physics program\nwill be statistically limited. However, the constraints from comparison of the $\\nu_\\mu$\ndisappearance spectrum with that from $\\nu_e$ appearance mitigate, in part,\nthe absence of a direct flux measurement from the ND.

As the sensitivity depends on the true value of the unknown\nCP-violating phase, \\deltacp, all possible values of \\deltacp are\nconsidered\\footnote{For the case of the MH determination, the usual\n  association of this test statistic with a $\\chi^2$ distribution for\n  one degree of freedom is incorrect; additionally the assumption of a\n  Gaussian probability density \n  implicit in this notation is not exact.

In terms of this test statistic, the MH\nsensitivity of DUNE with an exposure of \\SI{300}~\\ktMWyr{} is\nillustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:mhexec} for the case of normal\nhierarchy and the current best-fit value of \\sinst{23} = 0.45. \n\nFor this exposure, the DUNE determination of the MH will be definitive for\nthe overwhelming majority of the  \\deltacp and \\sinst{23} parameter space.\nEven for unfavorable combinations of the parameters, a statistically\nambiguous outcome is highly unlikely.  \n\\begin{cdrfigure}[Summary of mass hierarchy sensitivities]{mhexec}{The\n    square root of the mass hierarchy discrimination metric $\\Delta\n    \\chi^2$ is plotted as a function of the unknown value of \\deltacp\n    for an exposure of \\SI{300}~\\ktMWyr{} \n    (left).

The dependence of the mass\nhierarchy sensitivity on systematics is still under evaluation, but\ncurrent studies indicate a only weak dependence on the assumptions for \nthe achievable systematic uncertainties. This indicates that a measurement of the unknown\nneutrino mass hierarchy with very high precision can be carried out\nduring the first few years of operation with an optimized beamline\ndesign, discussed in Section~\\ref{v1ch:tech-designs:beam-strategy} and \\vollbnf.\nConcurrent analysis of the corresponding atmospheric-neutrino\nsamples in an underground detector will improve the precision and\nspeed with which the MH is resolved.\n\n\nDUNE will search for CP violation using the \\numu to \\nue and \\anumu\nto \\anue oscillation channels, with two objectives.  First, DUNE aims\nto observe a signal for leptonic CP violation independent of the\nunderlying nature of neutrino oscillation phenomenology. Such a signal\nwill be observable in comparisons of $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\nu_e$ and\n$\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_e$ oscillations of the LBNF\nbeam neutrinos in a wide range of neutrino energies over the\n\\SIadj{1300}{\\km} baseline.\n\n\n\nSecond,\nDUNE aims to make a precise determination of the value of \\deltacp\nwithin the context of the standard three-flavor mixing scenario\ndescribed by the PMNS neutrino mixing matrix. Together, the pursuit of\nthese two goals provides a thorough test of the standard three-flavor\nscenario.\n\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[CP-violation sensitivity and $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$\n  resolution as a function of exposure]{execsummaryCP}{The\n    significance with which CP violation can be determined for 75\\% of\n    \\deltacp values (left) and the expected 1$\\sigma$ resolution\n    (right) as a function of exposure in years using the proposed\n    staging plan outlined in this chapter.

As a LArTPC, DUNE has enhanced capability for\ndetecting the $p\\to K^+\\bar{\\nu}$ channel, where lifetime\npredictions from supersymmetric models extend beyond, but remain close\nto, the current (preliminary) Super-Kamiokande limit of $\\tau/B >\n\\SI{5.9e33}{year}$ (90\\% C.L.), obtained from a \\SI[number-unit-product = -,\ninter-unit-product=\\ensuremath{{}\\cdot{}}]{260}{\\kt\\year}\nexposure~\\cite{kearns_isoups}\\footnote{The lifetime shown here is\n  divided by the branching fraction for this decay mode, $\\tau/B$, and\n  as such is a \\emph{partial lifetime}.}.  The signature for an\nisolated, nearly monochromatic charged kaon in a LArTPC is highly distinctive,\nwith multiple distinguishing features. \n\nThe DUNE LArTPC far detector deep underground will reach a limit of\n\\SI{3e34}{\\year}s after 10--12 years of operation\n(Figure~\\ref{fig:execsummarypdk}), depending on the deployment\nscenario, and would see nine events with a background of 0.3 should\n$\\tau/B$ be \\SI{1e34}{\\year}s, just beyond the current limit. A\n\\ktadj{40} detector will improve the current limits by an order of\nmagnitude after running for two decades. Even a \\ktadj{10} detector\ncould yield an intriguing signal of a few events after a ten-year\nexposure.\n\n\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[Sensitivity to the decay $p\\to K^+ \\bar{\\nu}$\n  with liquid argon detectors]{execsummarypdk} {Sensitivity to the\n    decay $p\\to K^+ \\bar{\\nu}$ as a function of time for different DUNE \nLArTPC module deployment strategies. \n  For comparison, the current limit from SK is also shown, as well as the projected limit from the proposed Hyper-K experiment with \\SI{5600}\\ktyr{} of \n  exposure and a timeline based on a 1-Mt detector.\n  The limits are at 90\\% C.L., calculated for\n  a Poisson process including background, assuming that the detected events\n  equal the expected background.}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{figures/lar4x10.png}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\nMany models in which the $p\\to K^+\\overline{\\nu}$ channel mode is\ndominant, e.g., certain supersymmetric GUT models, also favor other\nmodes involving kaons in the final state, thus enabling a rich program\nof searches for nucleon decay in the DUNE LArTPC detector.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Supernova-Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics}\n\nThe neutrinos from a core-collapse supernova are emitted in a burst of\na few tens of seconds duration, with about half the signal emitted in the first\nsecond. The neutrino energies are mostly in the range 5--50 MeV, and the\nluminosity is divided roughly equally between the three known neutrino\nflavors.  Current experiments are sensitive primarily to\nelectron antineutrinos ($\\bar{\\nu}_e$), with detection through the inverse-beta decay\nprocess on free protons\\footnote{This refers to neutrino interactions with the nucleus of a\nhydrogen atom in H$_2$O in water detectors or in hydrocarbon chains in \nliquid scintillator detectors.},\n which dominates the interaction rate in water\nand liquid-scintillator detectors.  Liquid argon has a unique sensitivity to\nthe electron-neutrino ($\\nu_e$) component of the flux, via the absorption\ninteraction on $^{40}$Ar,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\nu_e +{}^{40}{\\rm Ar} & \\rightarrow & e^-+{}^{40}{\\rm K^*}.\n\\end{eqnarray*} \nThis interaction can be tagged via the coincidence of the emitted\nelectron and the accompanying photon cascade from the $^{40}{\\rm K^*}$\nde-excitation.  About \\num{3000} events would be expected in a \\ktadj{40}\nfiducial mass liquid argon detector for a supernova at a distance of\n\\SI{10}{\\kilo\\parsec}.  In the neutrino channel the oscillation\nfeatures are in general more pronounced, since the $\\nu_e$ spectrum is\nalways significantly different from the $\\nu_\\mu$ ($\\nu_\\tau$) spectrum \nin the initial core-collapse stages, to a larger degree than is the\ncase for the corresponding $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ spectrum.  Detection of a large\nneutrino signal in DUNE would help provide critical information on key\nastrophysical phenomena such as\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the neutronization burst,\n\\item formation of a black hole,\n\\item shock wave effects,\n\\item shock instability oscillations, and\n\\item turbulence effects.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn addition to yielding unprecedented information on the mechanics of\nthe supernova explosion, the observation of a core-collapse supernova in\nDUNE will also probe particle physics, \nproviding neutrino oscillation signatures (with sensitivity to mass hierarchy and ``collective effects'' due to neutrino-neutrino interactions), as well as tests for new physics such as Goldstone bosons (e.g., Majorons), neutrino magnetic\nmoments, new gauge bosons (``dark photons''), ``unparticles'' and\nextra-dimensional gauge bosons.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Precision Measurements with the DUNE Near Detector}\n\n\nThe DUNE near detector\n\n\nwill provide precision measurements of\nneutrino interactions that are essential\nfor controlling the systematic uncertainties in the long-baseline\noscillation physics program.  The near detector \nwill include argon targets and will measure the absolute flux and energy-dependent\nshape of all four neutrino species, \\numu, \\anumu, \\nue and \\anue,\n\nto accurately predict for each species the\nfar/near flux ratio as a function of energy.  It will also measure the\nfour-momenta of secondary hadrons, such as charged and neutral mesons,\nproduced in the neutral- and charged-current interactions that\nconstitute the dominant backgrounds to the oscillation signals.\n\nThe near detector will also be the source of data for a rich program\nof neutrino-interaction physics in its own right. For an integrated\nbeam intensity of \\num{1e20} \nprotons-on-target at \\SI{120}{GeV}, the expected number of events per\nton is \\num{170000} (\\num{59000}) \n\\numu (\\anumu) charged-current and \\num{60000} (\\num{25000}) neutral-current interactions in the $\\nu$ ($\\overline\\nu$) beam\\footnote{With PIP-II, the integrated protons-on-target per year is\n  expected to be around $1.1\\times 10^{21}$ at \\SI{120}\\GeV. The mass\n  of the Ar target in the DUNE ND is expected to be approximately\n  100~kg.}. \n\n\n  These numbers correspond to \\num{e5} neutrino interactions\non argon per year for the range of beam configurations and near detector\ndesigns under consideration.  Measurement of fluxes, cross sections\nand particle production over a large energy range of\n\\SIrange{0.5}{50}{\\GeV} are the key elements of this program.  These\ndata will also help constrain backgrounds to proton-decay signals\nfrom atmospheric neutrinos.  Furthermore, very large samples of events\nwill be amenable to precision reconstruction and analysis, and will be\nexploited for sensitive studies of electroweak physics and nucleon\nstructure, as well as for searches for new physics in unexplored\nregions, such as heavy sterile neutrinos, high-$\\Delta m^2$\noscillations, and light Dark Matter particles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, the primary science goals of DUNE are drivers for the\nadvancement of particle physics. The questions being addressed are of\nwide-ranging consequence: the origin of flavor and the generation\nstructure of the fermions, \n\nthe physical mechanism that provides the CP\nviolation needed to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe, \nand the high-energy physics that would lead to the instability\nof matter.  Achieving these goals requires a dedicated, ambitious and\nlong-term program.  No other proposed long-baseline neutrino\noscillation program with the scientific scope and sensitivity of DUNE\nis as advanced in terms of engineering development and project\nplanning.  The staged implementation of\nthe far detector as four 10-kt modules will enable\nexciting physics in the intermediate term, including a definitive mass\nhierarchy determination and possibly a measurement of the CP phase, \nwhile providing the fastest route toward achieving the\nfull range of DUNE's science objectives.  Should DUNE find that the CP\nphase is not zero or $\\pi$, it will have found strong indications\n($>3\\sigma$) of leptonic CP violation.\n\nThe DUNE experiment is a world-leading international physics\nexperiment, bringing together the \ninternational neutrino community as well as leading experts in nucleon decay\nand particle astrophysics to explore key questions at the forefront of\nparticle physics and astrophysics.

The layout of the near site facilities is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:nearsite-topo}. The science requirements as determined by the DUNE\ncollaboration drive the performance requirements of the beamline and near detector, which in turn \ndictate the requirements on  \nthe components, space, and functions necessary to construct, install, and operate the beamline and near detector. ES\\&H and facility operations requirements (i.e., \\textit{programmatic} requirements) also provide input to the design.\n \n\\begin{cdrfigure}[Layout of LBNF Near Site]{nearsite-topo}{Layout of the LBNF Near Site}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{nearsite-topo}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n \n \nThe beamline is designed to provide a neutrino beam of sufficient intensity and appropriate energy range to meet the goals of DUNE for long-baseline neutrino oscillation physics. The design is a conventional, horn-focused neutrino beamline. The components of the beamline will be designed to extract a proton beam from the Fermilab Main Injector (MI) and transport it to a target area where the collisions generate a beam of charged particles that are focused by the neutrino horns. The focused charged particles then decay, producing neutrinos (e.g., $\\pi^+\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\nu_\\mu$) to create the neutrino beam directed towards the near and far detectors.\n \nThe facility is designed for initial operation at a proton-beam power of \\SI{1.2}{\\MW}, capable of supporting an upgrade to \\SI{2.4}{\\MW}. Operation of the facility is planned for twenty years, while the lifetime, \nincluding the shielding, is planned for thirty years. It is \n\nassumed that operations during the first five years will be at \\SI{1.2}{\\MW} and the remaining fifteen years at \\SI{2.4}{\\MW}.  \nThe experience gained from the various neutrino projects has contributed extensively to the reference design. In particular, the NuMI beamline serves as the prototype design. Most of the subsystem designs and the integration between them follow, to a large degree, from previous projects. \n \nThe proton beam will be extracted at MI-10, a new extraction point. After extraction, this primary beam will travel horizontally heading west-northwest toward \nthe far detector. It is then \n\nbent upward to an apex before being bent downward at the appropriate angle. \nThis requires construction of an earthen embankment, or hill, whose dimensions are commensurate with the bending strength of the dipole magnets required for the beamline. \nThe raised design of the primary beam \n\nminimizes expensive underground construction; it also significantly enhances ground-water radiological protection. \n\n \nThe narrow proton beam impinges on a target, producing a more diffuse, secondary beam of particles that in turn decay to produce the neutrino beam. \n\nThe secondary pions and kaons are then focused by the neutrino horn system into a long unobstructed decay tunnel. \n\nThe decay tunnel in the reference design is a pipe of circular cross section with its \ndiameter and length optimized such that decays of the pions and kaons result in neutrinos in the energy range useful for the experiment. \nThe decay tunnel is followed immediately by the absorber, which removes the remaining beam hadrons. \n \nRadiological protection is integrated into the LBNF beamline reference design in two important ways. First, shielding is optimized to reduce exposure of personnel to radiation dose and to minimize radioisotope production in ground water within the surrounding rock. Secondly, the safe handling and control of tritiated ground water produced in or near the beamline drives many aspects of the design. \n \nBeamline CF includes an enclosure connecting to the existing Main Injector at MI-10, concrete underground enclosures for the primary beam, targetry, horns and absorber, and related technical support systems. Service buildings will be constructed to provide support utilities for the primary proton beam at LBNF~5 and to support the absorber at LBNF~30 (shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:nearsite-topo}).  The Target Hall Complex at LBNF~20 houses the targetry system.  Utilities will be extended from nearby existing services, including power, domestic and industrial water, sewer, and communications. \n \nNear Detector CF includes a small muon alcove area in the Beamline Absorber Hall and a separate underground Near Detector Hall that houses the near detector. A service building called LBNF~40 with two shafts to the underground supports the near detector. The underground hall is sized for the reference design near detector.\n \n \n\\subsection{Far Site Facilities}\n \nThe scope of LBNF at SURF includes both conventional facilities and cryogenics infrastructure to support the DUNE far detector. Figure~\\ref{fig:lbnf-cavern-layout} shows the layout of the underground caverns that will house the detector modules with a separate cavern to house utilities and cryogenics systems. The requirements derive from the DUNE collaboration science requirements, which drive the space and functional requirements for constructing and operating the far detector.  ES\\&H and facility operations (programmatic) requirements also provide input to the design. The far detector is divided into four \\ktadj{10} fiducial mass detector modules. The designs of the four detector chambers, two each in two caverns, and the services to the caverns will be as similar to one another as possible for efficiency in design, construction and operation. \n \n\\begin{cdrfigure}[LBNF Far Site cavern configuration]{lbnf-cavern-layout}{LBNF Far Site cavern configuration}  \n\\includegraphics[width=.7\\textwidth]{lbnf-cavern-layout}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n \n \nThe scope of the Far Site CF includes design and construction for facilities both on the surface and underground. The underground conventional facilities include new excavated spaces at the 4850L for the detector, utility spaces for experimental equipment, utility spaces for facility equipment, drifts for access, as well as construction-required spaces. Underground infrastructure provided by CF for the detector \nincludes power to experimental equipment, cooling systems and cyberinfrastructure. Underground infrastructure necessary for the facility includes domestic (potable) water, industrial water for process and fire suppression, \nfire detection and alarm, normal and standby power systems, a sump pump drainage system for native and leak water around the detector, water drainage to the facility-wide pump-discharge system, and cyberinfrastructure for communications and security.\nIn addition to providing new spaces and infrastructure underground, CF will enlarge and provide infrastructure in some existing spaces for LBNF and DUNE use, such as the access drifts from the Ross Shaft to the new caverns. New piping will be provided in the shaft for cryogens (gas argon transfer line and the compressor suction and discharge lines) and domestic water as well as power conduits for normal and standby power and cyberinfrastructure. \n \nSURF currently has many surface buildings and utilities, some of which will be utilized for LBNF. The scope of the above-ground CF includes only that work necessary for LBNF, and not for the general rehabilitation of buildings on the site, which remains the responsibility of SURF. \nElectrical substations and distribution will be upgraded to increase power and provide standby capability for life safety. Additional surface construction \nincludes a small control room in an existing building and a new building to support cryogen transfer from the surface to the underground near the existing Ross Shaft.\n \nTo reduce risk of failure of essential but aging support equipment during the construction and installation period, several SURF infrastructure operations/maintenance activities are included as early activities in  the LBNF Project. These include completion of the Ross Shaft rehabilitation, rebuilding of hoist motors, and replacement of the Oro Hondo fan; if not addressed, \nfailure of this aging infrastructure is more likely, which could limit or remove access to the underground areas.\n \nThe scope of the LBNF cryogenics infrastructure includes the design, fabrication and installation of four cryostats to contain the liquid argon (LAr) and the detector components. It also includes a comprehensive cryogenics system that meets the performance requirements for purging, cooling and filling the cryostats, for achieving and maintaining the LAr temperature, and for purifying the LAr outside the cryostats. \n \nEach cryostat is composed of a free-standing steel-framed structure with a membrane cryostat \ninstalled inside, to be constructed in one of the four excavated detector chambers. The cryostat is designed for a total LAr mass capacity of \n17.1~kt. Each tank has a stainless steel liner (membrane) as part of the \nsystem to provide full containment of the liquid. The hydrostatic pressure loading of the LAr is transmitted through rigid foam insulation to the surrounding structural steel frame, which provides external support for the cryostat. All penetrations into the interior of the cryostat will be made through the top plate to minimize the potential for leaks, with the exception of the sidewall penetration that is used for connection to the LAr recirculation system.\n \nCryogenics system components are located both on the surface and within the cavern. The cryogen receiving station is located on the surface near the Ross Shaft to allow for receipt of LAr deliveries for the initial filling period; it also has a buffer volume to accept LAr during the extended fill period. A large vaporizer for the nitrogen circuit feeds gas to one of four compressors located in the Cryogenic Compressor Building; the compressor discharges high-pressure nitrogen gas to pipes in the Ross shaft. The compressors are located on the surface because the electrical power  and thermal cooling requirements are less stringent than for an installation at the 4850L.  \n \nEquipment at the 4850L includes the nitrogen refrigerator, liquid nitrogen vessels, argon condensers, external LAr recirculation pumps, and filtration equipment. Filling each cryostat with LAr in a reasonable period of time is a driving factor for the refrigerator and condenser sizing.  Each cryostat will have its own argon recondensers, argon-purifying equipment and overpressure-protection system located in the Central Utility Cavern. Recirculation pumps will be placed outside of and adjacent to each cryostat in order to circulate liquid from the bottom of the tank through the purifier.\n \n\n\\section{Strategy for Developing the LBNF Beamline}\n\\label{v1ch:tech-designs:beam-strategy}\n\n \nThe neutrino beamline described in this CDR is a direct outgrowth of the design~\\cite{lbnecdr} developed for the LBNE\nCD-1 review in 2012.  That design was driven by the need to minimize cost, while delivering the performance required to meet the scientific objectives of the long-baseline neutrino program.  It includes many features that followed directly from the \nsuccessful NuMI beamline design as updated for the NOvA experiment.  It utilizes a target and horn system based on NuMI designs, with the spacing of the target and two horns set to maximize flux at the first, and to the extent possible, second \noscillation maxima, subject to the limitations of  the NuMI designs for these systems.  The target chase volume --- length and width --- are set to the minimum necessary to accommodate this focusing system, and the temporary morgue space to store \nused targets and horns is sized based on the size of the NuMI components.  Following the NuMI design, the decay pipe is helium-filled, while the target chase is air-filled.  \n \nThe LBNF beamline is designed to utilize the Main Injector proton beam, as will be delivered after the PIP-II upgrades~\\cite{pip2-2013}.  \nThe  proton beam energy can be chosen to be between 60 and 120~GeV, with the corresponding range of beam power from 1.0 to 1.2~MW.\nThe ability to vary the \nproton beam energy is important for optimizing the flux spectrum and to understand systematic effects in the beam production, and to provide flexibility to allow the facility to address future questions in neutrino physics that may require a \ndifferent neutrino energy spectrum.  To allow for the higher beam power that will be enabled by future upgrades to the Fermilab accelerator complex beyond PIP-II, the elements of the beamline and supporting conventional facilities that cannot be changed once \nthe facility is built and has been irradiated are designed to accommodate beam power in the range of 2.0 to 2.4~MW for the corresponding proton beam energy range of 60 to 120~GeV.  These elements include primary beam components, target hall, decay pipe and absorber, as \nwell as the shielding for them.  Components that can be replaced, such as targets and horns, are designed for the \\MWadj{1.2} initial operation.  \nAdditional R\\&D\n\nwill be required to develop these components \nfor operation at the higher beam power. \n\nSince the 2012 CD-1 review, the beamline design has evolved in a number of areas, as better understanding of the design requirements and constraints has developed.  Some of these design changes have come to full maturity and are \ndescribed in this CDR.  Others require further development and evaluation to determine if and how they might be incorporated into the LBNF neutrino beamline design.  They offer the possibility of higher performance, flexibility in \nimplementation of future ideas, and/or greater reliability and will be developed by the DUNE\ncollaboration in the near future. The beamline facility is designed to have an operational lifetime of 20 years, and it is important that it be designed to allow future upgrades and modifications that will allow it to \nexploit new \ntechnologies and/or adapt the neutrino spectrum to address new questions in neutrino physics over this long period. The key alternatives and options under consideration and the strategy for evaluating and potentially implementing them are summarized below.  They are described in more detail in the \\href{https://web.fnal.gov/project/LBNF/SitePages/Proposals\n               \n \nFurther optimization of the target-horn system has the potential to substantially increase the neutrino flux at the first and especially second oscillation maxima and to reduce wrong-sign neutrino background, thereby increasing the sensitivity to CP \nviolation and mass hierarchy determination, as discussed in \\volphys.  This optimization work is ongoing and may yield further improvements beyond those currently achieved. Engineering studies of the proposed horn designs and methods \nof integrating the target into the first horn must be performed to turn these concepts into real structures that can be built and that satisfy additional requirements in areas such as reliability and longevity.  These studies will be carried out between CD-1 and CD-2 to \ndetermine the baseline design for the LBNF target-horn system.  Since targets and horns must be replaceable, it is also possible to continue development of the target-horn system in the future and replace the initial system with a more advanced \ndesign or one optimized for different physics.  Such future development, beyond that necessary to establish the baseline design at CD-2, would be done outside of the LBNF Project.\n \nThe more advanced focusing system, called the ``optimized beam configuration'' in \\volphys, utilizes horns that are longer and larger in diameter and that are spaced farther apart than in the reference design, which would require a target chase approximately 9~m longer and 0.6~m wider.  \nIt cannot be ruled out that further optimization, or future designs that would\nallow exploration of new questions may require additional space beyond this.  Also, the larger horns will require a larger \nspace for temporary storage of used, irradiated components, requiring, in turn, an increase in the size of the morgue or a revision of the remote handling approach.  Between CD-1 and CD-2, studies will be done to determine not only the geometric \nrequirements from the final baseline target-horn system, but also to estimate the dimensions needed to accommodate potential future designs.\n \nThe material, geometry and structure of the target assembly itself can have significant impact both on the effective pion production and the energy spectrum of pions, which in turn affect the neutrino spectrum, and on the reliability and longevity of \nthe target, which affects the integrated beam exposure.  Potential design developments range from incremental (e.g., changing from the reference design rectangular cross section, water-cooled graphite target to a cylindrical \nhelium-cooled target), to more substantial (e.g., changing target material from graphite to beryllium), to radical (e.g., implementing a hybrid target with lighter material upstream and heavier material downstream and perhaps constructed of a set of spheres captured in a \ncylindrical skin).  New designs beyond the current reference design are also needed in order to accommodate the higher beam power (up to 2.4~MW) that will be provided by the PIP-III upgrade.  \nTarget development will largely be carried out in the \ncontext of worldwide collaborations on high-power targetry such as the Radiation Damage In Accelerator Target \nEnvironments (RaDIATE~\\cite{radiate-web}) collaboration, and not within the LBNF Project. The LBNF design must be such that it can fully exploit future developments in target design.\n \nThe length and diameter of the decay pipe also affect the neutrino flux spectrum.  A longer decay pipe increases the total neutrino flux with a larger increase at higher energies; a larger diameter allows the capture and decay of lower-energy pions, \nincreasing the neutrino flux at lower energies as described in \\volphys. The dimensions also affect the electron-neutrino and wrong-sign backgrounds.  Unlike targets and horns, the decay pipe cannot be modified after the facility is built, making the \nchoice of geometry particularly important.  The reference design values of \\SI{204}{\\meter} length and \\SI{4}{\\meter} diameter appear well matched to the physics of DUNE but studies to determine the optimal dimensions continue.  The cost of increasing the decay \npipe length or diameter  is relatively large, including \nthe impact on the absorber.\nTherefore, studies of the decay pipe must include \nevaluation of the relative advantages of\ninvestment in the decay pipe versus investment in \nother systems, e.g., a larger target hall complex, more advanced target-horn systems, or more far detector mass.  \nStudies currently in progress will continue to be carried out jointly by LBNF and DUNE between CD-1 and CD-2 to determine the baseline decay-pipe geometry.\n\n\n\\section{DUNE Detectors}\n\nThe DUNE detectors to be installed at SURF (the far site) and Fermilab (the near site) will enable the scientific program of DUNE.  The detector \nrequirements derive from the DUNE science goals.\n\n\n\\subsection{The Far Detector}\nThe  far detector will be located deep underground at the 4850L and have\na  fiducial mass of \\SI{40}{\\kt} to perform sensitive studies of long-baseline oscillations with a \\kmadj{1300} baseline as well as a rich astroparticle physics program and nucleon decay searches. The far detector  will be composed of four \nsimilar modules, each instrumented as a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC).\nThe concept of the LArTPC provides\nexcellent tracking and calorimetry performance, hence it is ideal for massive neutrino detectors such as the DUNE far detector, which require high signal efficiency and effective background discrimination,  an excellent capability to identify and  precisely measure neutrino events over a wide range of energies, and an excellent reconstruction of the kinematical properties\nwith a high resolution. The full imaging of events will allow study of neutrino interactions and\nother rare events with an unprecedented resolution.\n The huge mass will allow collection of sufficient statistics for precision\nstudies, as discussed in Chapter~\\ref{v1ch:science}.\n\nThe LArTPC, pioneered in the context of the ICARUS project, is a mature technology. It is the outcome\nof several decades of worldwide R\\&D.  Nonetheless, the size of a single \\ktadj{10} DUNE module represents an extrapolation of over one order of magnitude compared to the largest operated detector, the ICARUS~T600. To address this challenge, DUNE is developing two far detector options, the reference design and an alternative design, and is engaged in a \ncomprehensive prototyping effort. At this stage, the development of two options is a strength \nmade possible by the merging of the worldwide neutrino community into DUNE.  The two detector\nconcepts are illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:FarDet-overview-SPDP}.\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[3D models of the DUNE far detector designs]{FarDet-overview-SPDP}\n{3D models of two 10-kt detectors using the single-phase reference design (left) \nand the dual-phase alternative design (right) for the DUNE far detector to be \nlocated at 4850L.}\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{1.0\\textwidth}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.5\\textwidth]{FarDet-3D-SP.jpg}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.46\\textwidth]{DP_det2.jpg}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\n\nInteractions in LAr produce ionization charge and scintillation light.\nThe ionization electrons are drifted with a constant electric field away from the cathode\nplane and towards the segmented anode plane. \nThe prompt scintillation light,\ndetected by photo-detectors, provides the absolute time of the event.\nThe reference design adopts a single-phase readout, where the readout anode is composed of wire planes in the LAr volume. \nThe alternative design implements a  dual-phase approach, in which the \nionization charges are extracted, amplified and detected in gaseous argon (GAr) above the liquid surface. \nThe dual-phase design would allow for a finer readout pitch (3~mm), \na lower detection-energy threshold, and better pattern reconstruction of the events.\nThe photon-detection schemes used in the two designs are complementary, one is distributed\nwithin the LAr volume, the other is concentrated at the bottom of the tank.\n\nThe \\ktadj{10} reference design TPC is described in Chapter 4 of \\voldune. \nIts active volume is 12\\,m high, 14.5\\,m wide and \n58\\,m long, instrumented with anode plane assemblies (APAs), \nwhich are 6.3\\,m high and 2.3\\,m wide, and cathode plane assemblies (CPAs), 3\\,m high by 2.3\\,wide. \nVertical stacks of\ntwo APAs and four CPAs \ninstrument the 12\\,m height of the active volume. The 12.5-m width of the detector is \nspanned by three stacks of APAs and two stacks of CPAs in an APA:CPA:APA:CPA:APA\narrangement, resulting in four 3.6-m drift volumes, while the 58-m length of the active volume\nis spanned by 25 such stack arrangements placed edge to edge. Hence a \\ktadj{10} \nfar detector module consists of 150 APAs and 200 CPAs. The CPAs are held at $-$180\\,kV, such that \nionization electrons drift a maximum distance of 3.6\\,m in the electric field of 500\\,V\\,cm$^{-1}$.\nThe highly modular nature of the detector design allows for manufacturing to be distributed across a number of sites.\n\nA  comprehensive prototyping strategy for both designs is actively pursued (see Chapter 9 of \\voldune).\nThe reference design, closer to the original ICARUS design, is currently being validated in the 35-t prototype \nLAr detector at Fermilab.  The alternative design, representing a novel approach, has been proven on several\nsmall-scale prototypes. Presently\na 20-t dual-phase prototype (WA105) with dimensions 3$\\times$1$\\times$1~m$^3$ is being constructed at CERN,  \nand should be operational in 2016. \nThe ultimate validation of the engineered solutions for both designs of the FD is foreseen in\nthe context of the neutrino activities at the CERN North Area extension (EHN1 area) around 2018, \nwhere full-scale engineering prototypes will be \nassembled and commissioned. Following this milestone, a test-beam data \ncampaign will be executed \nto collect a large sample of charged-particle interactions\nin order to study the response of the detector with high precision.\nA comprehensive list of synergies between the reference and alternative designs has been identified (Chapter 6 of \\voldune). Common solutions for DAQ, electronics, HV feed-throughs, and so on, will pursued and implemented, independent of the details of the TPC design. The ongoing and planned efforts \nwill\nprovide the ideal environment to exploit such synergies and implement common solutions.\nThere is recognition that the LArTPC technology will continue to evolve with (1) the large-scale prototypes at the CERN Neutrino Platform and the experience from the Fermilab SBN program, and (2) the experience gained during the construction and commissioning of the first \\ktadj{10} module. \nThe staged approach with the deployment of consecutive modules will\n\nenable an early science program while allowing implementation of improvements and developments  during the experiment's lifetime.\nThe strategy for implementing\nthe far detector is presented in Section~\\ref{v1ch3:fd-impl-strategy}.\n\n\n\\subsection{The Near Detector} \n\nThe primary role of the DUNE near detector system is to characterize the energy spectrum and the composition of the neutrino beam at the source, in terms of\nboth muon- and electron-flavored neutrinos and antineutrinos, and to provide measurements of neutrino interaction cross sections. This is \nnecessary to control systematic uncertainties with the precision needed to fulfill the DUNE primary science objectives.\nThe separation between fluxes of neutrinos and antineutrinos requires a magnetized neutrino detector to \ncharge-discriminate electrons and muons produced in the neutrino charged-current interactions.\n\n As the near detector will be exposed to an intense flux of neutrinos, it will \ncollect an unprecedentedly large sample of neutrino \ninteractions, allowing for an extended science program. \nThe near detector will therefore provide a broad program of fundamental neutrino interaction \nmeasurements, which are an important part of the ancilliary scientific goals of the DUNE collaboration. \n\nThe reference design for the near detector design is the NOMAD-inspired fine-grained tracker (FGT), illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:FGT_schematic}. Its subsystems include a central \nstraw-tube tracker and an electromagnetic calorimeter embedded in a 0.4-T dipole field. The steel of the\nmagnet yoke will be instrumented with muon identifiers. The strategy for implementation of\nthe near detector is presented in Section~\\ref{v1ch:strategyND}.\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[Fine-grained\ntracker (FGT) near neutrino detector schematic]{FGT_schematic}{A schematic drawing of the fine-grained tracker design}\n\\includegraphics[width=.8\\textwidth]{FGT_Overview}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\n\nThe near detector will be complemented by a Beamline Measurement System (BLM) located in the region of the beam absorber at the downstream end of the decay region. The BLM aims to measure the muon fluxes from hadron decay and\n is intended to monitor the beam profile on a spill-by-spill basis. It will operate for the life of the experiment.\n\n\n\\section{Strategy for Implementing the DUNE Far Detector}\n\\label{v1ch3:fd-impl-strategy}\n\nThe LBNF project will provide four separate cryostats to house the far detector (FD) modules on the 4850L at SURF.  \nInstrumentation of the first detector module\nwill commence in 2021. \nAs part of the deployment and risk mitigation strategies, \nthe cryostat for the second detector must be available when the first cryostat \nis filled. The aim is to install the third and fourth cryostats as rapidly thereafter as funding \nallows.\n\nThe DUNE collaboration aims to deploy four 10-kt (fiducial) mass FD modules based \non the \nLArTPC technology, the viability \nof \nwhich has been proven by the ICARUS experiment. Neutrino \ninteractions in liquid argon produce ionization and scintillation signals. While \nthe basic detection method is the same, DUNE contemplates two options for the readout \nof the ionization signals: single-phase readout, where the ionization is detected \nusing readout (wire) planes in the liquid argon volume; and the dual-phase approach, where \nthe ionization signals are amplified and detected in gaseous argon above the liquid \nsurface. The dual-phase approach, if demonstrated, would allow for a 3-mm readout \npitch, a lower detection energy threshold, and better reconstruction of \nthe events. \n\n\n\nAn active development program for \nboth technologies is being pursued in the context of the Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN)\nprogram and \nthe CERN Neutrino Platform. \n\n\nA flexible \napproach to the DUNE far detector designs offers the potential to bring additional \ninterest and resources into the experimental collaboration. \n\n\\subsection{Guiding Principles for the DUNE Far Detector}\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The lowest-risk design for the first 10-kt module satisfying the requirements \nwill be adopted, allowing for its installation at SURF to commence in 2021. \nInstallation  of the second 10-kt module should commence before 2022. \n\n\\item  There is recognition that the LArTPC technology will continue to evolve with: (1) the \nlarge-scale prototypes at the CERN Neutrino Platform and the experience from the \nFermilab SBN program, and (2) the experience gained during the construction and \ncommissioning of the first 10-kt module. It is assumed that all four modules \nwill be similar but not necessarily identical.\n\n\\item  In order to start installation on the timescale of 2021, \nthe first  10-kt module will be based on the APA/CPA (single-phase) design, which is currently the lowest\nrisk option. There will be a clear and transparent decision process (organized by the DUNE \nTechnical Board) for the design \nof the second and subsequent far detector modules, allowing for evolution of the \nLArTPC technology to be implemented. The decision will be \nbased on physics performance, technical and schedule risks, costs and funding \nopportunities.\n\n\\item The DUNE collaboration will instrument the second cryostat as soon as possible.\n\n\\item A comprehensive list of synergies between the reference and alternative designs \nhas been identified and summarized in \\voldune. Common solutions for DAQ, \nelectronics, HV feed-throughs, etc., will be pursued and implemented, independent \nof the details of the TPC design.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Strategy for the First 10-kt Far Detector Module}\n\\label{v1ch3:first-fd-mod-strategy}\n\nThe viability of wire-plane LArTPC readout has already been demonstrated by the ICARUS T600 \nexperiment, where data were successfully accumulated over a period of three years. \nAn extrapolation of the observed performance and the implementation of improvements \nin the design (such as immersed cold electronics) will allow the single-phase \napproach to meet the LBNF/DUNE far detector requirements. In order to start the FD installation\nby 2021, \nthe first 10-kt module will be based on the single-phase design using anode and cathode\nplane assemblies (APAs and CPAs), described in Chapter 4 of \\voldune. \nBased on previous experience and the \nfuture development path in the Fermilab SBN program and at the CERN Neutrino Platform, \nthis choice represents the lowest-risk option for installation of the first 10-kt FD module by \n2021. \nFor these reasons, the APA/CPA single-phase wire plane LArTPC readout \nconcept \nis the \\textit{reference design} \nfor the far detector. \nThe design is already relatively advanced for the conceptual  \nstage. From this point on, modifications to the reference design will require approval\nby the DUNE Technical Board. A preliminary design review will take place as early \nas possible, utilizing the experience from the DUNE 35-t prototype; the design \nreview will define the baseline design that will form the basis of the TDR (CD-2). \nAt that point, the design will be put under a formal change-control \nprocess. \n\nA single-phase engineering prototype,\ncomprising six full-sized drift cells of the TDR engineering baseline,\nis planned as a central part of the risk-mitigation \nstrategy for the first 10-kt module. It\nwill be validated at the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2018 (pending approval by CERN). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the  performance of this prototype, \na final design review will take place towards the end of 2018 and construction of the readout planes will \ncommence in 2019, to be ready for first installation in 2021. \nThe design reviews will be organized by the DUNE Technical Coordinator. \n\nIn parallel with preparation for construction of the first 10-kt far detector module, \nthe DUNE collaboration recognizes the potential of the dual-phase technology and \nstrongly endorses the already approved development program at the CERN Neutrino \nPlatform (the WA105 experiment), which includes the operation of the 20-t prototype \nin 2016 and the 6$\\times$6$\\times$6\\,m\\textsuperscript{3} demonstrator in 2018. Participation \nin the WA105 experiment is open to all DUNE collaborators. A concept for the dual-phase \nimplementation of a far detector module is presented as an \\textit{alternative \ndesign} in \\voldune. This alternative design, if demonstrated, \ncould form the basis of the second or subsequent 10-kt modules, in \nparticular to achieve improved detector performance in a cost-effective way. \n\n\n\\subsection{DUNE at the CERN Neutrino Platform}\n\\label{v1ch3:dune-at-cern}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo large LArTPC prototypes are in progress at the CERN Neutrino Platform, a single-phase and a dual-phase, to be ready on similar time scales. \nFor the dual-phase prototype, WA105 has signed an MoU with the CERN Neutrino Platform to provide the large \n$\\sim$8$\\times$8$\\times$8\\,m\\textsuperscript{3} cryostat by October 2016 in the new EHN1 extension. \nBoth prototypes will be exposed to a charged-particle test \nbeam spanning a range of particle types and energies.  \n\nThe DUNE collaboration will instrument \nthe single-phase LArTPC with an arrangement \nof six APAs and six CPAs, in an APA:CPA:APA configuration, providing an engineering \ntest of the full-size drift volume. These assemblies will be produced at two or more sites with the cost \nshared between the DOE project and international partners. This CERN prototype thus \nprovides the opportunity for the production sites to validate the manufacturing \nprocedure ahead of large-scale production for the far detector. Three major operational \nmilestones are defined for this single-phase prototype: (1) engineering validation \n(successful cool-down); (2) operational validation (successful TPC readout with \ncosmic-ray muons); and (3) physics validation with test-beam data. Reaching milestone \n2, scheduled for early 2018, will allow the retirement of a number of technical \nrisks for the construction of the first 10-kt module. The proposal for the DUNE \nsingle-phase prototype will be presented to the CERN SPS Scientific Committee in June 2015. \n\nIn parallel, the WA105 experiment, approved by the CERN Research Board in 2014 and supported \nby the CERN Neutrino Platform, has a funded plan to construct and operate a large-scale \ndemonstrator utilizing the dual-phase readout in the test beam by October 2017. \nSuccessful operation and demonstration of long-term stability of the WA105 demonstrator \nwill establish this technological solution as an option for the second or subsequent \nfar detector modules. The DUNE dual-phase design is based on independent 3$\\times$3\\,m$^2$\ncharge readout planes (CRP) placed at the gas-liquid interface. Each module provides \ntwo perpendicular ``collection'' views with 3-mm readout pitch. A \\ktadj{10} module \nwould be composed of 80 CRPs hanging from the top of the cryostat, decoupled from \nthe field cage and cathode. The WA105 demonstrator will contain four 3$\\times$3m$^2$ \nCRPs, \nproviding the opportunity to validate the manufacturing procedure \nahead of large-scale production. WA105 is presently constructing a 3$\\times$1\\,m$^2$ \nCRP to be operated in 2016. The same operational milestones (engineering, operational, \nphysics) are defined for the dual-phase as for the single-phase prototype.\n\nThe DUNE program at the CERN Neutrino Platform will be coordinated by a single \nL2 manager. Common technical solutions will be adopted wherever possible for the \ntwo prototypes. \nThe charged-particle test-beam data will provide essential calibration samples \nfor both technologies and will enable a direct comparison of the relative physics \ncapabilities of the single-phase and dual-phase TPC readout. \n\n\n\\subsection{Strategy for the Second and Subsequent 10-kt Far Detector Modules}\n\\label{v1ch3:subsqt-fd-mod-strategy}\n\nFor the purposes of cost and schedule, the reference design for the first module \nis taken as the reference design for the subsequent three modules. However, \nthe experience with the first \\ktadj{10} module and the development activities at \nthe CERN Neutrino Platform are likely to lead to the evolution of the TPC technology, both \nin terms of refinements to single-phase design and the validation of the operation \nof the dual-phase design. The DUNE technical board will instigate a formal review \nof the design for the second module in 2020; the technology choice \nwill be based on risk, cost (including the potential benefits of additional \nnon-DOE funding) and physics performance (as established in the CERN charged-particle \ntest beam). After the decision, the design of the second module will come under formal \nchange control. This process will be repeated for the third and fourth modules. \n\n\nThis strategy allows flexibility with respect to international contributions, enabling the DUNE collaboration to\nadopt evolving approaches for subsequent modules. This approach provides the possibility of attracting interest \nand resources from a broader community, and space for flexibility to respond to \nthe funding constraints from different sources. \n\n\n\\section{Strategy for Implementing the DUNE Near Detector(s)}\n\\label{v1ch:strategyND}\n\n The primary scientific motivation for \nthe DUNE near detector \nis to determine the beam spectrum for the long-baseline \nneutrino oscillation studies. The near detector, which is exposed to an intense \nflux of neutrinos, also enables a wealth of fundamental neutrino \ninteraction measurements, which are an important part of the  scientific \ngoals of the DUNE collaboration. Within the former LBNE collaboration the neutrino \nnear detector design was the NOMAD-inspired fine-grained tracker (FGT), which \nwas established through a strong collaboration of U.S. and Indian institutes.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Guiding Principles for the DUNE Near Detector}\n\n\nIt is recognized that a detailed cost-benefit study of potential near detector options \nhas yet to take place and such a study is of high priority to the DUNE collaboration. The\nprimary design considerations for the DUNE near neutrino detector include\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item  \nthe \nability to adequately constrain the systematic errors in the DUNE LBL oscillation \nanalysis, which requires the capability to precisely measure exclusive neutrino\ninteractions; and\n\n\\item \nthe self-contained non-oscillation \nneutrino physics program.\n\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{DUNE Near Detector Reference Design }\n\nThe NOMAD-inspired fine-grained tracker (FGT) concept is the \\textit{reference \ndesign} for CD-1 review. The cost and resource-loaded schedule for CD-1 review \nwill be based on this design, as will the near site conventional facilities. The \nFine-Grained Tracker consists of:  central straw-tube tracker (STT) of volume \n3.5\\,m$\\times$3.5\\,m$\\times$6.4\\,m; a lead-scintillator sandwich sampling electromagnetic calorimeter \n(ECAL); a large-bore warm dipole magnet, with inner dimensions of \n4.5\\,m$\\times$4.5\\,m$\\times$8.0\\,m, surrounding the STT and ECAL and providing a magnetic field of 0.4\\,T; \nand RPC-based muon detectors (MuIDs) located in the steel of the magnet, as well \nas upstream and downstream of the STT. The reference \ndesign is presented in Chapter \n7 of \\voldune. \n\nFor ten years of operation in the LBNF 1.2-MW beam (5 years neutrinos + 5 years \nantineutrinos), the near detector will record a sample of more than 100 million \nneutrino interactions and 50 million antineutrino interactions. These vast samples \nof neutrino interactions will provide the necessary strong constraints on the \nsystematic uncertainties for the LBL oscillation physics --- the justification is \ngiven in Section 6.1.1 of \\volphys. The large samples of neutrino \ninteractions will also provide significant physics opportunities, including \nnumerous topics for PhD theses.  \n\n\n\nThe contribution of Indian institutions to the design and construction of the DUNE \nFGT neutrino near detector is a vital part of the strategy for the construction \nof the experiment. The reference design will provide a rich self-contained physics \nprogram. From the perspective of an ultimate LBL oscillation program, there may \nbe benefits of augmenting the FGT with, for example, a relatively small LArTPC \nin front of the FGT that would allow for a direct comparison with the far detector. \nA second line of study would be to augment the straw-tube tracker  with \na high-pressure gaseous argon TPC. At this stage, the benefits of such options \nhave not been studied; alternative designs for the near detector are not presented in \nthe CDR and will be the subject of detailed studies in the coming months. \n\n\\subsection{DUNE Near Detector Task Force}\n\nA full end-to-end study of the impact of the near detector design (in particular of the fine-grain tracker) on the LBL oscillation \nsystematics has yet to be performed. Many of the elements of such a study are in \ndevelopment, for example the Monte Carlo simulation of the FGT and the adaptation \nof the T2K framework for implementing ND measurements as constraints in the propagation \nof systematic uncertainties to the far detector. \n\nAfter the CD-1-R review, the DUNE collaboration will initiate a detailed study \nof the optimization of the near detector. To this end a new task force will be set \nup with the charge of:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item delivering the simulation of the near detector reference design and possible alternatives,\n\n\\item undertaking an end-to-end study to provide a quantitative understanding of \nthe power of the near detector designs to constrain the systematic uncertainties on the LBL \noscillation measurements, and\n\n\\item quantifying the benefits of augmenting the reference design with a LArTPC \nor a high-pressure gaseous argon TPC.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nHigh priority will be placed on this work and the intention is to engage a broad \ncross section of the collaboration in this process. The task force will be charged \nto deliver a first report by July 2016. Based on the final report of this task force and input \nfrom the DUNE Technical Board, the DUNE Executive Board will refine the DUNE strategy \nfor the near detector.\n\n\n\n\\cleardoublepage\n\n\\chapter{Organization and Management}\n\\label{v1ch:org-mgmt}\n\n\n\\section{Overview}\n\nTo accommodate a variety of international funding model constraints, LBNF and DUNE are organized as separate projects. As mentioned in the Introduction, the LBNF project is responsible for design and construction of the conventional facilities, beamlines, and cryogenic infrastructure needed to support the experiment.  The DUNE project is responsible for the construction and commissioning of the detectors used to pursue the scientific program.  LBNF is organized as a DOE/Fermilab project incorporating international partners.   DUNE is an international project organized by the DUNE collaboration with appropriate oversight from stakeholders including the DOE.\n\n\n\\section{LBNF}\n\n\n\\subsection{Project Structure and Responsibilities}\n\nThe LBNF project is charged by Fermilab and DOE to design and construct the conventional and technical facilities needed to support the DUNE collaboration.  LBNF works in close coordination with DUNE to ensure that the scientific requirements of the program are satisfied through the mechanisms described in Section~\\ref{sec:lbnf-dune-interface}. LBNF also works closely with SURF management to coordinate the design and construction of the underground facilities required for the DUNE far detector. \n\nLBNF consists of two major L2 subprojects coordinated through a central Project Office located at Fermilab: Far Site Facilities and Near Site Facilities. Each L2 project incorporates several large L3 subprojects as detailed in the WBS structure presented in Figure~\\ref{fig:lbnf-wbs}.\n\nThe project team consists of members from Fermilab, CERN, South Dakota Science and Technology Authority (SDSTA), and BNL.  The team, including members of the Project Office as well as the L2 and L3 managers for the individual subprojects, is assembled by the Project Director. The project team to WBS Level~3 is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:lbnf-org}. \nLine management for environment, safety and health, and quality assurance flows through the Project Director. \n\n\nThrough their delegated authority and in consultation with major stakeholders, the L2 Project Managers determine which of their lower-tier managers will be Control Account Managers (CAMs) for the project WBS. L2 and L3 Project Managers are directly responsible for generating and maintaining the cost estimate, schedule, and resource requirements for their subprojects and for meeting the goals of their subprojects within the accepted baseline cost and schedule. \n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[LBNF Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to level 3]{lbnf-wbs}{LBNF Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to level 3}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{lbnf-wbs-l3-nonames}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\nThe design and construction of LBNF is supported by other laboratories and consultants/contractors that provide scientific, engineering, and technical expertise. A full description of LBNF Project Management is contained within the LBNF Project Management Plan\\cite{PMP-10770}. \n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[LBNF organization]{lbnf-org}{LBNF organization}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{lbnf-org}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{SDSTA and SURF}\n\nLBNF plans to construct facilities at SURF to house the DUNE far detector. SURF is owned by the state of South Dakota and managed by the SDSTA. \n\nCurrent SURF activities include operations necessary for allowing safe access to the 4850L of the mine, which houses the existing and under-development science experiments. The DOE is presently funding SDSTA ongoing operations through Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and its SURF Operations Office through FY16; this is expected to change to funding through Fermilab starting in FY17. \n\nThe LBNF Far Site Facilities Manager is also an employee of SDSTA and is contracted to Fermilab to provide management and coordination of the Far Site Conventional Facilities (CF) and Cryogenics Infrastructure subprojects. LBNF contracts directly with SDSTA for the design of the required CF at SURF, whereas the actual construction of the CF will be directly contracted from Fermilab. Coordination between SDSTA and the LBNF project is necessary to ensure efficient operations at SURF. This will be facilitated via an agreement being developed between SDSTA and Fermilab regarding the LBNF project \\fixme{[new reference]} that defines responsibilities and methods for working jointly on LBNF project design and construction. A separate agreement will be written for LBNF operations. \n\n\n\\subsection{CERN}\n\nThe European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is expected to significantly contribute to LBNF with technical components, required to support the deployment of the DUNE detectors and the neutrino beamline. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Coordination within LBNF}\n\nThe LBNF project organization is headed by the LBNF Project Director who is also the Fermilab Deputy Director for LBNF and reports directly to the Fermilab Director. \nWithin Fermilab's organization, two new divisions are being created to execute the Far Site Facilities and Near Site Facilities subprojects. The heads of these divisions will report to the LBNF Project Manager. \nAny personnel working more than half-time on these subprojects would typically be expected to become a member of one of these divisions, while other contributors will likely be matrixed in part-time roles from other Fermilab Divisions.  The heads of the other Fermilab Divisions work with the L1 and L2 project managers to supply the needed resources on an annual basis.  The management structure described above is currently being transitioned into and will not be fully in place until the Fall of 2015.  \n\nThe LBNF WBS defines the scope of the work. All changes to the WBS must be approved by the LBNF Project Manager prior to implementation. At the time of CD-1-Refresh, the LBNF WBS is in transition. Both the current and the post CD-1-R WBS is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:lbnf-wbs} to demonstrate how the scope will map from one WBS to the other. \nSDSTA assigns engineers and others as required to work on specific tasks required for the LBNF project at the SURF site. This is listed in the resource-loaded schedule as contracted work from Fermilab for Far Site CF activities. \nCERN and Fermilab are developing a common cryogenics team to design and produce the Cryogenics Infrastructure subproject deliverables for the far site. CERN provides engineers and other staff as needed to complete their agreed-upon deliverables.  \nLBNF has formed several management groups with responsibilities as described below.\n\n\\textbf{Project Management Board:} LBNF uses a Project Management Board to provide formal advice to the Project Director on matters of importance to the LBNF project as a whole. Such matters include (but are not limited to) those that:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item have significant technical, cost, or schedule impact on the project,\n\\item have impacts on more than one L2 subproject,\n\\item affect the management systems for the project,\n\\item have impacts on or result from changes to other projects on which LBNF is dependent, and/or\n\\item result from external reviews or reviews called by the Project Director\n\\end{itemize}\nThe Management Board serves as the\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item LBNF Change Control Board, as described in the Configuration Management Plan\\cite{CMP-10760}, and the \n\\item Risk Management Board, as described in the Fermilab Risk Management Procedure for Projects~\\cite{fnal-risk-mgmt}. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Beamline Technical Board:} The role of the LBNF Beamline Technical Board (TB) is to provide recommendations and advice to the Beamline Project Manager on important technical decisions that affect the design and construction of the Beamline. The members of the Technical Board must have knowledge of the project objectives and priorities in order to perform this function. The Beamline Project Manager chairs the Beamline TB. The Beamline Project Engineer is the Scientific Secretary of the Board and co-chairs the Beamline TB as needed. \n\n\\textbf{FSCF Neutrino Cavity Advisory Board:} The Far Site CF (FSCF) project has engaged three international experts in hard rock underground construction to advise it periodically through the design and construction process regarding excavation at SURF. The Board meets at the request of the FSCF-PM, generally on site to discuss specific technical issues. The Board produces a report with its findings and conclusions for project information and action. \n\n\n\\section{DUNE}\n\n\n\\subsection{DUNE Collaboration Structure}\n\nThe DUNE collaboration brings together the members of the international science community\ninterested in participating in the DUNE experiment.  The collaboration defines the scientific goals of the experiment and subsequently the requirements on the experimental facilities needed to achieve these goals.  The collaboration also provides the scientific effort required for the design and construction of the DUNE detectors, operation of the experiment, and analysis of the collected data. There are four main entities within the DUNE organizational structure:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item DUNE Collaboration, including the General Assembly of the collaboration and the Institutional Board. \n\\item DUNE Management, consisting of the two Co-Spokespersons, the Technical Coordinator, and the Resource Coordinator.  These four along with the chair of the Institutional Board and five additional members of the collaboration form the DUNE Executive Committee.\n\\item DUNE Project Management, containing the Project Office, headed by the Project Manager, and the managers of the DUNE detector and prototyping groups. \n\\item DUNE Science Coordination, incorporating the coordinators of the DUNE detector and prototyping groups, the Physics and Software/Computing Coordinators, as well as the DUNE Technical and Finance Boards.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe connections between the different members of these entities are illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:dune-org}.\n\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[DUNE Project and Collaboration organization]{dune-org}{DUNE Project and Collaboration organization}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{dune-collaboration-org}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{DUNE Management Structure}\n\nThe main responsibilities of each of the roles are summarized below:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item \\textbf{DUNE General Assembly} is composed of the full membership of the collaboration.  It is consulted on all major strategic decisions through open plenary sessions at collaboration meetings and is provided regular updates on issues affecting the collaboration at weekly collaboration meetings.  The Collaboration General Assembly elects the Co-Spokespersons through a process defined by the Institutional Board.\n\\item \\textbf{DUNE Institutional Board (IB)} is the representative body of the collaboration institutions. It has responsibility for the governance of the collaboration. The IB has final authority over collaboration membership issues and defines the requirements for inclusion of individuals on the DUNE author list. The IB is also responsible for the process used to select the Co-Spokespersons and the Executive Committee.  The IB chairperson serves on the Executive Committee and runs the Institutional Board meetings.\n\\item \\textbf{DUNE Co-Spokespersons} are elected by the collaboration to serve as its leaders.  They direct collaboration activities on a day-to-day basis and represent the collaboration in interactions with the host laboratory, funding agencies, and the broader scientific community.\n\\item \\textbf{DUNE Executive Committee (EC)} is the primary decision-making body of the collaboration and is chaired by the longest serving Co-Spokesperson.  The membership of the EC consists of the Co-Spokespersons, the Technical Coordinator, the Resource Coordinator, the chair of the IB, and five additional members of the collaboration (three elected IB representatives and two additional members selected by the Co-Spokespersons).  The EC operates as a decision-making body through consensus.  In cases where the EC is unable to reach a consensus, final decision-making authority is assigned to the Co-Spokespersons.  If the Co-Spokespersons are unable to reach their own consensus, the Fermilab Director will step in to resolve the issue.\n\\item \\textbf{Technical Coordinator (TC)} is jointly appointed by the Co-Spokespersons and the Fermilab Director and has reporting responsibilities to both.  In the context of the international DUNE project, the TC serves as the project director \nand is responsible for implementing the scientific and technical strategy of the collaboration.  Currently, the TC also serves as project director for the DOE-funded portion of the DUNE project.  In addition to managing the Project Office, the TC chairs the collaboration Technical Board which coordinates activities associated with the design, construction, installation, and commissioning of the \ndetector elements.\n\\item \\textbf{Technical Board (TB)} is chaired by the TC and has a membership that includes the coordinators and managers of the collaboration detector and prototyping groups.  It may also include additional members of the collaboration, nominated by the TC and approved by the EC, who are expected to bring useful knowledge and expertise to its discussions on technical issues.  The TB is the primary \nforum for discussion of issues related to \ndetector design, construction, installation and commissioning. \nThis body serves as a project change-control board for change requests with schedule and cost impacts that lie below pre-determined thresholds necessitating EC approval.  Change requests that have impacts on interfaces with the LBNF project, \npotential impacts on DUNE science requirements, or that require modifications of formal Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) with one or more \n\ncontributing funding agencies, are discussed within the TB; however these require higher-level approvals, starting with the EC.  The TB is also the primary forum for discussing technological design choices faced by the collaboration.  Based on these discussions, the TB is expected to make a recommendation on the preferred technology choice to the TC, who is then charged with making a final recommendation to the EC. \n\\item \\textbf{Resource Coordinator (RC)} is jointly appointed by the Co-Spokespersons and the Fermilab Director and has reporting responsibilities to both.  The RC chairs the Collaboration Finance Board and is tasked with preparing the formal MOUs that define the contributions and responsibilities of each institution.  The RC is also responsible for management of the common financial resources of the collaboration (common fund).  Project change requests approved by the EC that involve modification of MOUs with one or more of the participating funding agencies are taken by the RC first to the Collaboration Finance Board for discussion and then, in cases where consensus is obtained, to the Resources Review Board for final approval.\n\\item \\textbf{Finance Board (FB)} is chaired by the RC and has a membership that includes a single representative from each group of collaborating institutions whose financial support for participating in the DUNE experiment originates from a single, independent funding source.  These collaboration representatives are either nominated through their respective group of institutions and approved by the associated funding agency, or directly appointed by the funding agency.  The FB discusses issues related to collaboration resources such as contributions to project common funds and division of project responsibilities among the collaborating institutions.  The FB is also responsible for vetting proposed project change requests prior to their submission to the Resource Research Board for approval.\n\\item \\textbf{DUNE Science Coordinators} include the coordinators of the detector and prototyping groups as well as the coordinators of the DUNE physics and computing/software efforts.  Science coordinators are nominated by the Co-Spokespersons (jointly with the TC in the case of detector and prototyping group coordinators) and approved by the EC.  These coordinators are expected to establish additional collaboration sub-structures within their assigned areas to cover the full scope of collaboration activities within their areas of responsibility.  Detector and prototyping group coordinators report to the EC through the TB, while coordinators of the physics and software/computing efforts report directly to the EC.\n\n\\item \\textbf{DUNE Project Office (PO)} provides the project management for the design, construction, installation, and commissioning of the DUNE near and far detectors.  Members of the Project Office, including the Project Manager (PM), are appointed by the  TC.  The DUNE project will be run as an international project following DOE guidelines.  The PO will have control over common funds collected from the U.S. and international stakeholders.  Other contributions to the DUNE project are expected to be in the form of deliverables as defined through formal MOUs. The PO will maintain a full schedule for the entire DUNE project and track contributions through detailed subproject milestones.  The entire DUNE project (including international contributions) will follow the DOE critical decision process incorporating a CD-2 approval of its baseline cost and schedule and a CD-3 approval for moving forward with construction.  The current high-level WBS structure of the DUNE project, which will be evolving in the near future to best take advantage of the additional resources available within the new collaboration, is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:dune-wbs}.\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[DUNE Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)]{dune-wbs}{DUNE Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{dune-wbs-to-level3}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\n\n\\item \\textbf{DUNE Detector and Prototyping Managers} provide the required interface between the DUNE project and the members of the collaboration contributing to these efforts.  These managers sit within the detector and prototyping groups where all matters related to the design, construction, installation, and commissioning of the individual detector elements are discussed.  These managers are tasked with implementing the plans developed within their group and are part of a joint management team which addresses issues associated with project interfaces and coordination of detector and prototyping group efforts.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\section{LBNF/DUNE Advisory and Coordinating Structures}\n\\label{sec:lbnf-dune-interface}\n\nA set of structures is established to provide coordination among the participating funding agencies, oversight of the LBNF and DUNE projects, and coordination and communication between the two projects.  These structures and the relationships among them are shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:lbnfdune-org} and are described in this section.\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[Joint LBNF/DUNE management structure]{lbnfdune-org}{Joint LBNF/DUNE management structure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{joint-org}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\n\n\\subsection{International Advisory Council (IAC) }\n\nThe International Advisory Council (IAC) is composed of\nregional representatives, such as CERN, and representatives of\nfunding agencies that make major contributions to LBNF infrastructure or to DUNE. The IAC \nacts as the highest-level international advisory body to the U.S.\nDOE and the FNAL Directorate and facilitates\nhigh-level global coordination across the entire enterprise (LBNF and DUNE).\nThe IAC is chaired by the DOE Office of Science Associate Director\nfor High Energy Physics and includes the FNAL Director in its membership.  \nThe council meets as needed and provides pertinent advice to \nLBNF and DUNE  \nthrough the Fermilab Director.  \n\n\nSpecific responsibilities of the IAC include, but are not limited to,\nthe following:\n\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item During the formative stages of LBNF and DUNE\nthe IAC helps to coordinate the sharing of responsibilities among\nthe agencies for the construction of LBNF and DUNE.\nIndividual agency responsibilities for LBNF will be established in\nbilateral international agreements with the DOE. Agency contributions to\nDUNE will be formalized through separate agreements.\n\n\\item The IAC assists in resolving issues, especially those\nthat cannot be resolved at the Resources Review Boards (RRB) level,\ne.g., issues that require substantial redistributions of\nresponsibilities among the funding agencies.\n\n\\item The IAC assists as needed in the coordination,\nsynthesis and evaluation of input from project reports charged by\nindividual funding agencies, LBNF and DUNE project management,\nand/or the IAC itself, leading to recommendations for action by\nthe managing bodies.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe initial membership, as of May 19, 2015, of the IAC is as follows:\nJames Siegrist (DOE HEP, Chair),\nSergio Bertolucci (CERN),\nArun Srivastava (DAE),\nCarlos Henrique de Brito Cruz (FAPESP),\nFernando Ferroni (INFN),\nFabiola Gianotti (CERN),\nRolf Heuer (CERN),\nStavros Katsanevas (ApPEC),\nFrank Linde (ApPEC),\nNigel Lockyer (FNAL),\nReynald Pain (IN2P3/CNRS),\nJohn Womersley (STFC) and\nAgnieszka Zalewska (IFJ).\n\nThe DUNE Co-Spokespersons and/or other participants within\nthe Fermilab neutrino program will be invited to sessions of the IAC as\nneeded. Council membership may increase as additional funding agencies\nfrom certain geographic regions make major contributions to LBNF and DUNE.\n\n\\subsection{Resources Review Boards (RRB)}\n\nThe Resources Review Boards (RRB) are composed of representatives of all\nfunding agencies that sponsor LBNF and DUNE, and of the Fermilab\nmanagement. The RRB provides focused monitoring and detailed oversight\nof each of the projects. The Fermilab Director in coordination\nwith the DUNE RC defines its membership. A representative from the\nFermilab Directorate chairs the boards and\norganize regular meetings to ensure the flow of resources needed\nfor the smooth progress of the enterprise \nand for its successful completion.  \nThe managements of the\nDUNE collaboration and the LBNF project participates in the RRB meetings\nand make regular reports to the RRB on technical, managerial,\nfinancial and administrative matters, as well as status and\nprogress of the DUNE collaboration.\n\nThere are two groups  \nwithin the RRB: RRB-LBNF and RRB-DUNE. Each of\nthese groups monitors progress and addresses \n the issues specific to its area \n while the whole RRB deals with matters\nthat concern the entire enterprise. \nThe RRB will meet\nbiannually; these meetings \nwill start with a plenary\nopening session \nand be followed by \nRRB-LBNF and RRB-DUNE sessions. As DUNE progresses toward\nexperimental operations, RRB-Computing sessions will convene.\n\nDUNE Finance Board members who serve as National Contacts from the \nsponsoring funding agencies will be invited to RRB sessions.\n\nThe RRB  employs standing DUNE and LBNF \\textit{Scrutiny Groups} as needed\nto assist in its responsibilities. The scrutiny groups operate\nunder the RRB, and provide detailed information on financial and\npersonnel resources, costing, and other elements under the purview of the RRB.\n\nRoles of the RRB include:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item assisting the DOE and the FNAL Directorate\nwith coordinating and developing any required international\nagreements between partners,\n\\item monitoring and overseeing the Common Projects and the\nuse of the Common Funds,\n\\item monitoring and overseeing general financial and personnel support,\n\\item assisting the DOE and the FNAL Directorate\nwith resolving issues that may require reallocation of responsibilities\namong the project's funding agencies,\n\\item reaching consensus on a maintenance and operation procedure,\nand monitoring its function, and\n\\item  approving the annual construction, and maintenance and operation common fund \nbudget of DUNE.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Fermilab, the Host Laboratory}\n\nAs the host laboratory, Fermilab has a direct responsibility for the design,\nconstruction, commissioning and operation of the facilities and\ninfrastructure (LBNF) that support the science program. \nIn this capacity, Fermilab reports\ndirectly to the DOE through the Fermilab Site Office (FSO).\nFermilab also has an important oversight role for the DUNE project\nitself as well as an important coordination role in ensuring that\ninterface issues between the two projects are completely understood.\n\nFermilab's oversight of the DUNE collaboration and detector\nconstruction project is carried out through\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item regular meetings with the collaboration leadership,\n\\item approving the selection of collaboration Co-Spokespersons,\n\\item  providing the Technical and Resource Coordinators,\n\\item  convening and chairing the Resources Review Boards,\n\\item  regular scientific reviews by the PAC and LBNC,\n\\item  Director's Reviews of specific management, technical,\ncost and schedule aspects of the detector construction project, and\n\\item other reviews as needed.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{DUNE Collaboration}\t\n\nThe collaboration, in consultation with the Fermilab Director,\nis responsible for forming the international DUNE project team that is\nresponsible for designing and constructing the detectors.  \nThe Technical Coordinator\n(TC) and Resource Coordinator (RC) serve as the lead managers\nof this international project team and are selected jointly by\nthe Co-Spokespersons and the Fermilab Director.  Because the international DUNE\nproject incorporates contributions from a number of different\nfunding agencies, it \nis responsible for\nsatisfying individual tracking and reporting requirements associated\nwith \nthe different contributions.\n\n\\subsection{Long-Baseline Neutrino Committee (LBNC)}\n\nThe Long-Baseline Neutrino Committee (LBNC), composed\nof internationally prominent scientists with relevant expertise,\nprovides external scientific peer review for LBNF and DUNE \nregularly.\nThe LBNC reviews the scientific, technical and managerial\ndecisions and preparations for the neutrino program.\nIt acts in effect \nas an adjunct to the Fermilab Physics Advisory Committee\n(PAC), meeting on a more frequent basis than the PAC.\nThe LBNC may employ DUNE and LBNF Scrutiny Groups for more\ndetailed reports and evaluations. The LBNC members are appointed by the\nFermilab Director. The current membership of the LBNC is:\n\nDavid MacFarlane (SLAC, Chair),\nUrsula Bassler (IN2P3),\nFrancesca Di Lodovico (Queen Mary),\nPatrick Huber (Virginia Tech),\nMike Lindgren (FNAL),\nNaba Mondal (TIFR),\nTsuyoshi Nakaya (Kyoto),\nDave Nygren (UT Arlington),\nStephen Pordes (FNAL),\nKem Robinson (LBNL),\nNigel Smith (SNOLAB) and\nDave Wark (Oxford and STFC).\n\nAmong these members, David McFarlane and Dave Wark are also members of the Fermilab PAC.\n\n\\subsection{Experiment-Facility Interface Group (EFIG)}\n\nClose and continuous coordination between DUNE and LBNF is\nrequired to ensure the success of the combined enterprise.\nAn Experiment-Facility Interface Group (EFIG) was established\nin January 2015 to oversee and ensure the required coordination\nboth during the design/construction and operational\nphases of the program. This group covers areas including:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item  interface between the near and far detectors and the\ncorresponding conventional facilities,\n\\item interface between the detector systems provided by\nDUNE and the technical infrastructure provided by LBNF, and \n\\item design and operation of the LBNF neutrino beamline.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe EFIG is chaired by two deputy directors of Fermilab.\nIts membership includes the LBNF Project Director, Project Manager and Project Scientist, and \nthe DUNE Co-Spokespersons, Technical Coordinator, Resource Coordinator and the CERN-LBNF Project Manager.\nIn consultation with the DUNE and LBNF management, the EFIG Chairs will\nextend the membership as needed \nto carry out the coordination\nfunction. In addition, the DOE Federal Project Director for LBNF,\nthe Fermilab Chief Project Officer, and a designated representative\nof the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority (SDSTA) will\nserve ex officio. The EFIG Chairs designate a Secretary of the EFIG,\nwho keeps minutes of the meetings and performs other tasks as\nrequested by the Chair.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the EFIG Chairs to report EFIG proceedings\nto the Fermilab Director and other stakeholders. It is the responsibility\nof the DUNE Co-Spokespersons to report EFIG proceedings to the rest of\nthe collaboration. The EFIG meets weekly or as needed.\n\nThe current membership of the EFIG is:\n\nJoe Lykken (representing Fermilab Director, Chair),\nNigel Lockyer (acting LBNF Project Director),\nElaine McCluskey (LBNF Project Manager),\nJim Strait (LBNF Project Scientist),\n\\hyphenation{Andr\\'e}\nAndr\\'e Rubbia (DUNE Co-Spokesperson),\nMark Thomson (DUNE Co-Spokesperson),\nEric James (DUNE Technical Coordinator),\nChang Kee Jung (DUNE Resource Coordinator),\nMarzio Nessi (CERN),\nDavid Lissauer (BNL),\nJim Stewart (BNL),\nJeff Dolph (BNL, Secretary),\nMike Lindgren (FNAL Chief Project Officer, ex officio),\nPepin Carolan (DOE, ex officio), and \nMike Headley (SDSTA, ex officio).\n\n\n\n\\cleardoublepage\n\n\n\n\\chapter{Summary}\n\\label{ch:project-summary}\n\nLBNF/DUNE will be a world-leading facility for pursuing a cutting-edge program of neutrino physics and astroparticle physics. The \ncombination of the intense wide-band neutrino beam, the massive LArTPC far detector and the highly capable near detector will provide \nthe opportunity to discover CP violation in the neutrino sector as well as to determine the neutrino mass ordering and provide a \nprecision test of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm. The massive, deep-underground far detector will offer unprecedented sensitivity for \ntheoretically favored proton decay modes \nand for observation of electron neutrinos from a core-collapse supernova, should one occur in our galaxy during the operation of the experiment.\n\nIn addition to summarizing the compelling scientific case for LBNF/DUNE, this document presents an overview of the technical \ndesigns of the facility and experiment and the strategy for their implementation. \nThis strategy delivers the science goals described in the 2014 report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritisation Panel (P5) on a \ncompetitive timescale. Furthermore, a detailed management plan for the \norganization of LBNF as a U.S.-hosted facility and the DUNE experiment \nas a broad international scientific collaboration has been developed, thus satisfying the goal of internationalizing the project as highlighted in the \nP5 report.\n\n\n\\cleardoublepage\n\n\n\n\\cleardoublepage\n\\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}\n\\bibliography{common/citedb}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 29958, "prevtext": "\n\\vspace{1in}\n\n\n\n\n\\pagestyle{titlepage}\n\n\\begin{center}\n   {\\Huge  \\thedocsubtitle}  \n\n  \\vspace{5mm}\n\n  {\\Huge  \\cdrtitle}  \n\n  \\vspace{10mm}\n\n {\\LARGE {\\volintrotitle}}\n\n  \\vspace{15mm}\n\n{\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{lbnf_graphic_061615_metric_final}}\n\n  \\vspace{10mm}\n  \\today\n    \\vspace{15mm}\n    \n\\end{center}\n\n\\cleardoublepage\n\n\\includepdf[pages={-}]{cdr-authors.pdf}\n\n\n\\setcounter{page}{0}\n\n\\pagestyle{plain} \n\n\n\n\n\\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}\n\\textsf{\\tableofcontents}\n\n\n\n\\textsf{\\listoffigures}\n\n\n\\textsf{\\listoftables}\n\n\n\n\\printnomenclature\n\n\n\\iffinal\\else\n\\textsf{\\listoftodos}\n\\clearpage\n\\fi\n\n\\setcounter{page}{1}\n\n\\pagestyle{fancy}\n\n\n\\fancyhead{}\n\\fancyhead[RO,LE]{\\textsf{\\footnotesize \\thechapter--{\\arabic{page}}}}\n\\fancyhead[LO,RE]{\\textsf{\\footnotesize \\leftmark}}\n\n\\fancyfoot{}\n\\fancyfoot[RO]{\\textsf{\\footnotesize LBNF/DUNE Conceptual Design Report}}\n\\fancyfoot[LO]{\\textsf{\\footnotesize {\\volintrotitle}}}\n\\fancypagestyle{plain}{}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\nomenclature{$\\mathcal{O}(n)$}{of order $n$}\n\\nomenclature{3D}{3 dimensional (also 1D, 2D, etc.)} \n\\nomenclature{CDR}{Conceptual Design Report}\n\\nomenclature{CF}{Conventional Facilities}\n\\nomenclature{CP}{product of charge and parity transformations}\n\\nomenclature{CPT}{product of charge, parity and time-reversal transformations}\n\\nomenclature{CPV}{violation of charge and parity symmetry}\n\\nomenclature{DAQ}{data acquisition}\n\\nomenclature{DOE}{U.S. Department of Energy}\n\\nomenclature{DUNE}{Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment}\n\\nomenclature{ESH}{Environment, Safety and Health}\n\\nomenclature{eV}{electron volt, unit of energy (also keV, MeV, GeV, etc.)}\n\\nomenclature{FD}{far detector}\n\\nomenclature{FGT}{Fine-Grained Tracker}\n\\nomenclature{FSCF}{far site conventional facilities}\n\\nomenclature{NSCF}{near site conventional facilities}\n\\nomenclature{GUT}{grand unified theory}\n\\nomenclature{\\ktyr}{exposure (without beam), expressed in kilotonnes times years}\n\\nomenclature{\\ktMWyr}{exposure, expressed in kilotonnes $\\times$ megawatts $\\times$ years, based on 56\\% beam uptime and efficiency} \n\\nomenclature{L}{level, indicates depth in feet underground at the far site, e.g., 4850L}\n\\nomenclature{LAr}{liquid argon}\n\\nomenclature{LArTPC}{liquid argon time-projection chamber}\n\\nomenclature{LBL}{long-baseline (physics)}\n\\nomenclature{LBNF}{Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility}\n\\nomenclature{MH}{mass hierarchy}\n\\nomenclature{MI}{Main Injector (at Fermilab)}\n\\nomenclature{ND}{near neutrino detector}\n\\nomenclature{NDS}{Near Detector Systems;

The community has \ngenerally recognized that putting in place \nthe conditions necessary to \nexecute this challenging science program in a comprehensive way requires previously independent \n\nefforts to converge. \n\n\n\n\nIn this context, the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) represents the convergence of a substantial fraction of the worldwide neutrino-physics community around the \nopportunity provided by the \nlarge investment planned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support \n\na significant expansion of the underground infrastructure at the Sanford Underground Research \nFacility (SURF) in South Dakota, \\SI{1300}{\\km} from Fermilab, and to create a megawatt neutrino-beam facility at Fermilab by 2026.  The PIP-II accelerator upgrade~\\cite{pip2-2013} at \nFermilab will drive the new neutrino beamline at Fermilab with a beam power\\footnote{assuming a \\SI{120}{\\GeV} primary proton beam. For a \\SI{80}{\\GeV} primary proton beam, the corresponding beam power is \\SI{1.07}{\\MW}.} of up to \\SI{1.2}{\\MW}, with a planned upgrade \nof the accelerator complex to enable it to provide up to \\SI{2.4}{\\MW} of beam power by 2030.  \n\nThis document presents \nthe Conceptual Design Report (CDR) put forward by an international neutrino community to pursue \nthe Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF/DUNE),\na groundbreaking science experiment for long-baseline neutrino oscillation studies and for neutrino astrophysics and nucleon decay searches. The DUNE far detector will be a very large modular liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) located deep underground, coupled to the LBNF multi-megawatt  \nwide-band neutrino beam.   DUNE will also have a high-resolution and high-precision near detector.\n\nThe physics case for the LBNF neutrino facility was highlighted as a strategic priority in the 2014 P5 report~\\cite{p5report2014}.\nP5 identified the following minimum requirements for LBNF to proceed: \nthe identified capability to reach an exposure of at least 120~\\ktMWyr{}~\\footnote{An exposure\nof 1 MW.year corresponds to $1\\times 10^{21}$ protons-on-target per year at 120 GeV. This includes the LBNF beamline efficiency which is estimated to be 56\\%.}  by the 2035 timeframe;\nthe far detector situated underground with cavern space for expansion to at least 40-kt LAr fiducial;\n1.2-MW beam power upgradable to multi-megawatt power;\ndemonstrated capability to search for supernova bursts; and\na demonstrated capability to search for proton decay, \nproviding a significant improvement in discovery sensitivity over current searches for the proton lifetime.\nFurthermore, P5 identified  the \\textit{goal} of a sensitivity to CP violation of better than 3$\\sigma$ over more than 75\\% \nof the range of possible values of the unknown CP-violating phase \\deltacp.\nThe strategy presented in this CDR meets all of these requirements.\n\n\n\\section{The LBNF/DUNE Conceptual Design Report Volumes}\n\n\n\\subsection{A Roadmap of the CDR}\n\nThe LBNF/DUNE CDR describes the proposed physics program and \nconceptual technical designs of the facility and detectors.  At this stage, the design is\nstill undergoing development and the CDR therefore presents a \\textit{reference design} for each element as well as any \n\\textit{alternative designs} that are under consideration.\n\nThe CDR is composed of four volumes and is supplemented\nby several annexes that provide details of the physics program and technical designs. The volumes are as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\volintro{} --- provides an executive summary of and strategy for the experimental \nprogram and of the CDR as a whole.\n\\item \\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06148}{\\volphys{}} --- outlines the scientific objectives and describes the physics studies that \nthe DUNE collaboration will undertake to address them.\n\\item \\vollbnf{} --- describes the LBNF project, which includes design and construction of the \nbeamline at Fermilab, the conventional facilities at both Fermilab and SURF, and the cryostat\n and cryogenics infrastructure required for the DUNE far detector.\n\\item \\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02984}{\\voldune{}} --- describes the DUNE project, which includes the design, construction and \ncommissioning of the near and far detectors. \n\\end{itemize}\n\nMore detailed information for each of these volumes is provided in a set of annexes listed on the \\href{https://web.fnal.gov/project/LBNF/SitePages/Proposals\npage. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{About this Volume}\n\nThis introductory volume of the LBNF/DUNE Conceptual Design Report provides an overview of LBNF and\nDUNE (Chapter~\\ref{ch:project-overview}), including the strategy that is being developed to construct, install and commission the technical and conventional facilities in accordance with the requirements set out by the P5 report of 2014~\\cite{p5report2014}, which, in turn, is in line with the CERN\nEuropean Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) of 2013~\\cite{ESPP-2012}. This volume also introduces the DUNE science program (Chapter~\\ref{v1ch:science}) and the technical designs of the facilities and the detectors \n(Chapter~\\ref{v1ch:tech-designs}). It concludes with a description of the LBNF and DUNE organization and management structures (Chapter~\\ref{v1ch:org-mgmt}).\n\n\n\n\n\\section{A Compelling Scientific Program}\n\nThe study of the properties of neutrinos has produced \nmany surprises, including the evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles and interactions.   The phenomenon of neutrino flavor oscillations, whereby \nneutrinos can transform into a different flavor after traveling a distance, \nis now well established. Important conclusions that follow from these discoveries include that neutrinos have mass and that their \nmass eigenstates are mixtures of their \nflavor eigenstates.\n\nSpeculations on the origin of neutrino masses and mixings are wide-ranging. \nSolving the puzzle will require more precise and detailed experimental information with neutrinos and antineutrinos and with sensitivity to matter effects. With the exception of a few anomalous results, the current data can be described in terms of the three-neutrino paradigm, in which the \nquantum-mechanical mixing of the three mass eigenstates produces the three known neutrino-flavor states.  The mixings are described by the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, a parameterization that includes a CP-violating phase. \n\nThe primary science objectives \nof DUNE are to carry out a comprehensive investigation of neutrino oscillations to test CP violation in the lepton sector, determine the ordering of the neutrino masses, and to test the three-neutrino paradigm.\nBy measuring \\textit{independently} the  propagation of neutrinos and antineutrinos through matter, DUNE will be able to observe \nneutrino transitions with the precision required to determine the \nCP-violating phase and \nthe neutrino mass hierarchy.\n\n\nThe construction of LBNF and DUNE will also enable a high-priority ancillary science program, such as \nvery precise measurements of neutrino interactions and cross-sections, studies of nuclear effects in such interactions, measurements of the structure of nucleons, as well as precise tests of the electroweak theory. \nThese measurements of the properties of neutrino interactions are also necessary \n\nto achieve the best sensitivities in the long-baseline neutrino oscillation program. \n\n\nThe DUNE far detector, consisting of four LArTPC modules located deep underground, each with a mass forty times \nlarger than ever before built,  \n\n\nwill offer unique capabilities for addressing \nnon-accelerator physics topics. These include measuring atmospheric neutrinos, searching for nucleon decay, and measuring astrophysical neutrinos --- possibly even \nthe neutrino burst \nfrom a core-collapse supernova. \n\nObservations of these kinds will bring new insight into these fascinating natural phenomena. \n\n\n\nAn intriguing \nconjecture is that of neutrino masses being related to an \nultra-high-energy scale that may be associated with the unification of matter and forces. Such theories are able to describe the absence of antimatter in the universe in terms of the properties of ultra-heavy particles; they also \noffer an explanation \nof cosmological inflation in terms of the phase transitions associated with the breaking of symmetries at this ultra-high-energy scale. DUNE's capability to detect and study rare events such as nucleon decays in an unbiased and unprecedented way will allow it to probe these very high-energy scales. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, further developments of LArTPC \ntechnology during the course of the DUNE far detector construction may open up the opportunity\nto observe very low-energy phenomena such as solar neutrinos or even the diffuse supernova neutrino flux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Overall LBNF/DUNE Project Strategy} \n\nThe LBNF/DUNE project (the ``project'') strategy presented in this CDR has been developed to meet the requirements \nset out in the P5 report and \ntakes into account the recommendations of the CERN European Strategy for Particle \nPhysics (ESPP) of 2013, which classified the long-baseline neutrino program as \none of the four scientific objectives with required international infrastructure.\n\nThe Report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) \nstates that for a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment, ``The \nminimum requirements to proceed are the identified capability to reach an exposure \nof \\num{120}~\\ktMWyr{} by the 2035 timeframe, the far detector situated underground \nwith cavern space for expansion to at least 40~kt LAr fiducial volume, and 1.2~MW \nbeam power upgradable to multi-megawatt power. The experiment should have the demonstrated \ncapability to search for supernova bursts and for proton decay, providing a significant \nimprovement in discovery sensitivity over current searches for the proton lifetime.'' \nBased on the resource-loaded schedules for the reference designs of the facility (\\vollbnf)\nand the detectors (\\voldune), the strategy presented here meets these criteria. \n\nWith the availability of space for expansion and improved access at SURF, \nthe international DUNE collaboration proposes to construct a deep-underground neutrino observatory based on four independent \\ktadj{10} LArTPCs at this site. \nThe goal is the deployment of two \\ktadj{10} fiducial mass detectors in a relatively short timeframe, followed by future expansion to the full detector size as soon thereafter as possible. \n\nSeveral LArTPC designs are under development by different groups worldwide, involving both single- and dual-phase readout technology.\nThe DUNE \ncollaboration has the necessary scientific and technical expertise, \nand international participation  to design and implement this exciting discovery experiment. \n\nThe Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) provides\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item  the  technical and conventional facilities for a powerful \\MWadj{1.2} neutrino beam utilizing the PIP-II upgrade of the Fermilab accelerator \ncomplex, to become operational by 2025 \nat the latest, and to be upgradable to \\SI{2.4}{\\MW} with the proposed \nPIP-III upgrade;\n\n\\item  the civil construction (conventional facilities or CF) for the near detector systems at Fermilab; \n\n\\item the excavation of four underground caverns at SURF, planned to be completed \nby 2021 \nunder a single contract, with each cavern to be capable of housing a cryostat for\na minimum \\ktadj{10} fiducial mass LArTPC; and\n\n\n\n\\item surface, shaft, and underground infrastructure to support \nthe outfitting of the caverns with four free-standing, steel-supported cryostats \nand the required cryogenics systems. The first cryostat will be available for filling, after installation of the detector components, by\n2023, enabling a rapid deployment of the first two \\ktadj{10} far detector modules. \nThe intention is to install the third and fourth cryostats as rapidly as funding will \nallow.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) provides\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item four massive LArTPCs, each with a fiducial mass of at least \\SI{10}{\\kt}. The division of \nthe far detector into four equal-mass detectors provides the project flexibility \nin the installation and funding (DOE vs. non-DOE); this division also mitigates risks and allows for an early and graded science return.\n\n\\item the near detector systems, consisting of a high-resolution neutrino detector \nand the muon monitoring system that will enable \nthe precision \nneeded to fully \nexploit the statistical power of the \nfar detector coupled to the \nMW-class \nneutrino beam.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nBased on the reference design described below and in Volumes 2, 3 and 4 of this \nCDR, the resource-loaded schedule \nplans for the first two \\ktadj{10} far detector modules to be\noperational by 2025,\nwith first beam shortly afterward. \n\nAt that time, the cavern \nspace for all four \\ktadj{10} far detector modules will be available, allowing for \nan accelerated installation schedule if sufficient funding sources for\nthe experiment can be established on an accelerated timescale.  \n\n\\vspace{6pt}\nThe project strategy described above meets the experiment's scientific objectives,\n reaching an exposure of \n\\num{120}~\\ktMWyr{} by 2032, and potentially earlier if additional resources are identified. \nThe P5 recommendation of sensitivity to CP violation of 3$\\sigma$ for 75\\% of $\\delta_\\text{CP}$\nvalues can be reached with an exposure of \\num{850}~\\ktMWyr{} with an optimized beam.\n\n\n\\section{The International Organization and Responsibilities}\n\nThe \nmodel used by CERN for managing the construction and exploitation of the LHC and its experiments was used as a starting point for the joint management of LBNF and the experimental program.  Fermilab, as the host laboratory, has the responsibility for the facilities and their operations \n\nand oversight of the experiment and its operations.  Mechanisms to ensure input from and coordination among all of the funding agencies supporting the collaboration, modelled on the CERN Resource Review Board, have been adopted. \nA similar structure is employed to coordinate among funding agencies supporting the LBNF construction and operation.  \n\nThe LBNF/DUNE project will be organized as two distinct entities. The LBNF portion is funded primarily\nby the U.S. DOE acting on behalf of the hosting country.  CERN provides in-kind contributions to the LBNF infrastructure needed for the DUNE experiment. The DUNE portion is organized\nas an international collaboration; it is adopting a model in which the DOE and international funding agencies share costs \nfor the DUNE detectors.\n\nThe DUNE collaboration is responsible for\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the definition of the scientific goals and corresponding scientific and technical requirements on the detector systems and neutrino beamline;\n\\item the design, construction, commissioning and operation of the detectors; and\n\\item the scientific research program conducted with the DUNE detectors. \n\n\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nThe high-intensity proton source at Fermilab that will drive the long-baseline neutrino beam utilizes the existing \nMain Injector with upgraded injectors (PIP-II).  PIP-II is also being planned with significant international collaboration.  Fermilab, working \nwith the participation and support of international partners, is responsible for \nLBNF, including\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item design, construction and operation of the LBNF beamline, including the primary proton beamline and the neutrino beamline including target, focusing structure (horns), decay pipe, absorber, and corresponding beam instrumentation;\n\\item design, construction and operation of the CF and \nexperiment infrastructure on the Fermilab site required for the near detector system; and\n\\item design, construction and operation of the CF and \nexperiment infrastructure \nat SURF, including the cryostats and cryogenics systems, required for the far detector.\n\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\\section{A Two-Pronged Schedule} \n\n\nThe schedule for the design and construction work for LBNF and DUNE has two critical parallel paths: one for the \nfar site (SURF) and \nanother for the \nnear site (Fermilab). The schedule for the initial work is driven by the CF design and construction at each site. A summary of the schedule is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:summary-sched}.\n\n\n\\begin{cdrfigure}[High-level summary of LBNF/DUNE schedule]{summary-sched}{High-level summary of LBNF/DUNE schedule}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.2\\textwidth, angle=90]{summary-schedule.png}\n\\end{cdrfigure}\n\n\nWithin the anticipated DOE funding profile, in particular during the initial phase of the project, the far site conventional\nfacilities are advanced first; their final design starts in fall 2015. Early site preparation is timed to be completed \nin time to start excavation when the Ross Shaft rehabilitation work finishes\n in late 2017. As each detector \n cavern is excavated and sufficient utilities are installed, the cryostat and cryogenics system work proceeds, followed by detector installation, filling and commissioning. \n The far detector module \\#1 is to be operational by 2024 with modules \\#2 and \\#3 completed\n one and two years later, respectively, and module \\#4 completed by early 2027.\n\nThe near site work is delayed with respect to the far site due to the anticipated funding profile. The near site CF and beamline work essentially slows to nearly a stop \nuntil design restarts in late 2017. Optimization decisions about the beamline that affect the CF design will need to be made by late 2018 in order to be ready for the CF design process. The embankment is constructed and then allowed to settle for at least twelve months before the majority of the beamline CF work proceeds. The beneficial occupancies of the various beamline facilities \nare staggered to allow beamline installation to begin as soon as possible. With this timescale, the far detector science program \nstarts with the first module installed and no beam, focusing on non-accelerator-based science \nfor slightly more than one year until \nthe beamline installation is completed.\n\n\nThe near detector CF construction overlaps that for the beamline, but lags due to available funding. The near detector assembly begins on the surface before beneficial occupancy, after which the detector is installed, complete at about the same time as far detector module \\#4. \n\nThe DOE project management process requires approvals at Critical Decision milestones, which allow the LBNF/DUNE project to move to the next step. In fall 2015 the far site CF will seek CD-3a approval for construction of some of the CF and cryogenics systems at SURF. In spring 2018 LBNF near site CF will seek CD-3b construction approval for Advanced Site Preparation to build the embankment. In 2020 LBNF and DUNE will seek to baseline the LBNF/DUNE scope of work, cost and schedule, as well as construction approval for the balance of the project scope of work. \n\nThe project concludes with CD-4 approval to start operations.\n\n\n\\cleardoublepage\n\n\n\n\\chapter{DUNE Science}\n\\label{v1ch:science}\n\n\nDUNE will address fundamental questions key to our understanding of the universe. These include:\n\\begin{itemize}\n   \\item {\\bf What is the origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe?} Immediately after\n                    the Big Bang, matter and antimatter were created equally, but now matter dominates.\n                    By studying the properties of neutrino and antineutrino oscillations, LBNF/DUNE \n                    will pursue the current most promising avenue for understanding this asymmetry.\n   \\item {\\bf What are the fundamental underlying symmetries of the universe?} The patterns of mixings and masses between the particles of the Standard Model is not understood. By making precise measurements of the mixing between the neutrinos and the ordering of neutrino masses and comparing these with the quark sector, LNBF/DUNE could reveal new underlying symmetries of the universe.\n  \\item{\\bf  Is there a Grand Unified Theory of the Universe?} Results from a range of experiments suggest that the\n                 physical forces observed today were unified into one force at the birth of the universe.\n                Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), which attempt to describe the unification of forces,\n                predict that protons should decay, a process that has never been observed. DUNE will \n                search for proton decay in the range of proton lifetimes predicted by a wide range of GUT models.\n   \\item{\\bf How do supernovae explode and what new physics will we learn from a neutrino burst?}\n   Many of the heavy elements that are the key components of life were created in the super-hot cores of collapsing stars. DUNE would be able to detect the neutrino bursts from core-collapse supernovae within our galaxy (should any occur). Measurements of the time, flavor and energy structure of the neutrino burst will be critical for understanding the dynamics of this important astrophysical phenomenon, as well as bringing information on neutrino properties and other particle physics.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\section{DUNE Scientific Objectives}\n\nThe DUNE scientific objectives are categorized into: the \\textit{primary science program}, addressing the key science questions \nhighlighted by the particle physics project prioritization panel (P5); \na high-priority \\textit{ancillary science program} that is \nenabled by the construction of LBNF and DUNE; and \\textit{additional scientific objectives}, that may require further developments \nof the LArTPC technology. A detailed description of the physics objectives of DUNE is provided in \\href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06148}{Volume 2 of the CDR}.\n\n\n\\subsection{The Primary Science Program}\n\nThe primary science program of LBNF/DUNE  focuses on fundamental open questions in neutrino and astroparticle physics: \n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item precision measurements of the parameters that govern $\\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\nu_\\text{e}$ and\n           $\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\overline{\\nu}_\\text{e}$ oscillations with the goal of\n  \\subitem -- measuring the charge-parity (CP) violating phase $\\delta_\\text{CP}$, where a value differing from zero or $\\pi$ would represent the discovery of CP violation in the leptonic sector, providing a possible explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe;\n  \\subitem -- determining the neutrino mass ordering (the sign of $\\Delta m^2_{31} \\equiv m_3^2-m_1^2$), often referred to as the neutrino \\textit{mass hierarchy}; and\n  \\subitem -- precision tests of the three-flavor neutrino oscillation paradigm through studies of muon neutrino disappearance \n    and electron neutrino appearance in both $\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu}$ beams, including the \n    measurement of the mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ and the determination of the octant in which this angle lies.\n    \\item search for proton decay in several important decay modes, for example $\\text{p}\\rightarrow\\text{K}^+\\overline{\\nu}$, where the observation of proton decay would represent a ground-breaking discovery in physics, providing a portal to Grand Unification of the forces; and\n    \\item detection and measurement of the $\\nu_\\text{e}$ flux from a core-collapse supernova within our galaxy, should one occur during the lifetime of the DUNE experiment.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\subsection{The Ancillary Science Program}\n\nThe intense neutrino beam from LBNF, the massive DUNE LArTPC far detector and the high-resolution\n  DUNE near detector provide a rich ancillary science program, beyond the primary mission of the experiment. The ancillary science program includes\n\\begin{itemize}\n     \\item other accelerator-based neutrino flavor transition measurements with sensitivity to Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics, such as: non-standard interactions (NSIs); the search for sterile neutrinos at both the near and far sites;\n and measurements of tau neutrino appearance;\n     \\item measurements of neutrino oscillation phenomena using atmospheric neutrinos;\n     \\item a rich neutrino interaction physics program utilizing the DUNE near detector, including: a wide-range of measurements of neutrino cross sections; studies of nuclear effects, including neutrino final-state interactions; measurements of the structure of nucleons; and  measurement of $\\sin^2\\theta_\\text{W}$; and\n     \\item  the search for signatures of dark matter.\n\\end{itemize} \n\nFurthermore, a number of previous breakthroughs in particle physics have been serendipitous, in the sense that they were beyond the\noriginal scientific objectives of an experiment. The intense LBNF neutrino beam and novel capabilities for both \nthe DUNE near and far detectors will probe new regions of parameter space for both the accelerator-based and astrophysical frontiers, \nproviding the opportunity for discoveries that are not currently anticipated.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Long-Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Physics}\n\n\nPrecision neutrino oscillation measurements lie at the heart of the DUNE scientific program.\nThe \\SIadj{1300}{\\km} baseline, coupled with the wide-band\nhigh-intensity neutrino beam from LBNF, establishes one of DUNE's key\nstrengths, namely sensitivity to the matter effect. This effect leads to a\ndiscrete asymmetry in the \\numu $\\to$ \\nue versus \\anumu $\\to$ \\anue\noscillation probabilities, the sign of which depends on the presently\nunknown mass hierarchy (MH).
