It was argued early on that \nsuperconductivity and ferromagnetism cannot  coexist \n\\cite{ginzburg}.\nExternally applied magnetic fields also \ndestroy superconductivity - \neither through the generation of a vortex lattice or through the \nPauli paramagnetic effect \\cite{bennemann}.\nMagnetic impurities too have a drastic effect\n\\cite{ag},\nwith increasing concentration leading quickly to a gapless\nsuperconductor and then the loss of order itself.\nThese effects seemed to severely restrict the possibility\nof superconductivity coexisting with magnetic order.\n\nThe situation, however, is more interesting \nand suggestions about \nthe {\\it coexistence} of superconductivity\nand magnetism also date far back.  \nIn 1963 Baltensperger and Strassler \\cite{strassler}\nsuggested that superconductivity can actually coexist \nwith antiferromagnetic order.\nSignature of such coexistence was first observed\nin the ternary Chevrel phases\n\\cite{maple_fisher1982,fisher_maple1982, fulde_keller}\nRMo$_{6}$S$_{8}$ and RRh$_{4}$B$_{4}$\n(where R is a rare earth element). \nIn these\nmaterials it is believed that magnetism and superconductivity \narise from electrons which form distinct subsystems, and the \nordering of the magnetic degrees of freedom allows the\nsurvival of superconductivity\n\\cite{lynn2001,lynn1984,thomlinson1982,zwicknagl1981}.\n\nOver the last three  decades many more materials involving \nthe interplay of magnetism and superconductivity\nhave been discovered.\nThe high $T_c$ cuprates arise from a doped antiferromagnetic\ninsulator \\cite{plee2006}, \nthe parent compound of the iron pnictide \nsuperconductors \\cite{stewart_rmp, johnson2010} involves collinear \nantiferromagnetism, the iron chalcogenides \\cite{hsu2008, fang2008} \nemerge from a bicollinear antiferromagnetic state, and the \niron selenides \\cite{guo2010, fang2010} also involve proximity \nto an antiferromagnetic insulator.\nOver a large part of the phase \ndiagram magnetic order coexists with \nsuperconductivity in these compounds \n\\cite{dagotto_natrev,weisenmeyer2011}.\nSeveral heavy fermions also involve \ncoexisting magnetic order and superconductivity \n\\cite{saxena2000, scalapino_rmp}, {\\it e.g},\nthe Ce compounds \\cite{nicklas2007,pham2007}\nCeCoIn$_{1-x}$(Cd$_{x}$)$_{5}$ and \nCeIr(In$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$)$_{5}$,\nand several uranium based\nheavy fermions \\cite{pfleiderer_rmp}.\nIn many of these materials electron-electron\nrepulsion is responsible for emergence of \nlocal moments and the pairing is usually of\nthe `off site' $d$-wave type.\n\nA simpler variety of coexistence is seen in the rare earth \nquaternary borocarbides \\cite{muller_rev} \n(RTBC), where \nlocal moments already exist on the rare earths, and Kondo\ncouple to conduction electrons, and the electrons have a\nphonon mediated attraction between themselves.\nThis is traditional $s$-wave BCS physics playing out\nin the background of $f$ moment order, and offers a simple\nentry point to the coexistence problem.\nGiven the similar structure and valence, members of this\nfamily are expected to have the same nominal carrier\ndensity, and electronic structure. What does vary are\nthe `de Gennes factor' (DG), proportional to ${S(S+1)}$, \nwhere $S$ is the effective moment on the $f$ ion, and the \neffective pairing interaction, $\\eta$, say.  \nAll materials with a finite DG factor are magnetic but\nonly compounds with a relatively low DG factor and\nlarger $\\eta$ are superconducting.\n\nCoexisting magnetic and superconducting order \n\\cite{maple1995, lynn1997, gupta1998, hilscher_michor1999, \nbraun1998, dreschler2009, baba2008, rybaltchencho1999, schultz2011}\nhave been found in RNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C \nwhere, R $=$ Dy, Ho, Er and Tm, in reducing sequence of\nthe DG factor and increasing $\\eta$.\nWith reducing DG factor the magnetic transition temperature\n$T_{AF}$ decreases, from 20K in Gd to 10K in Dy to 2K in Tm,\nwhile the superconducting $T_c$ increases from $\\sim$ 6K in\nDy to $\\sim$ 11K in Tm. \n$T_{AF}$ scales roughly with the DG factor, and the\nmagnetic state in all compounds is primarily a\n$(0,0,q)$ spiral, while the $T_c$ falls monotonically\nwith increasing DG factor \\cite{muller_rev}. Despite much experimental \nwork the detailed symmetry of the paired state, and the\ngap anisotropy, is not settled yet.\n\nThere is a large theory effort in understanding the \ninterplay of magnetism and superconductivity, both in terms \nof general \nphenomenology \\cite{blount, greenside, kuper} and specific \nmicroscopic models \\cite{machida1980, grest1981, levin1984, \nnagi1988, umezawa1981, fenton1988, kontani, buzdin1985, \n buzdin1986, buzdin1981, pines1990, chubukov1998, schamalian2003,\n mckenzie1997, fukuyama1996, schamalian1998, kontani1999, yamada1999, \n littlewood2001, hertz1976, emery1986, hirsch1987, rink1986, jensen2007}.\nMicroscopic theories have addressed\nthe role of magnetic fluctuations in the cuprates \n\\cite{pines1990, chubukov1998, schamalian2003},\nthe layered organics \\cite{mckenzie1997, fukuyama1996, schamalian1998,  \nkontani1999, yamada1999},\nand the heavy fermions \\cite{littlewood2001, hertz1976,\nemery1986, hirsch1987, rink1986}, to name a few.\nWe wish to start with the simpler situation, pertinent to\nthe borocarbides, where one can employ a `Kondo lattice',\nfor the large $4f$ moments, augmented by a local \nattractive interaction\nbetween the electrons \\cite{paiva, pruschke}.\n\nThe local moments arising from the $4f$ shell couple to the \nconduction electrons through a Kondo coupling. The ground state \nbehavior of such a model has been addressed earlier in one\nspatial dimension \\cite{paiva} via density matrix renormalisation \ngroup (DMRG) treating the local moments as $S=1/2$.  There have \nalso been studies in higher dimensions \\cite{fulde2000, kontani, jensen2007,\njensen2002, maki2004, lee2004, shorikov2006, maki_physica2004} \naimed at reproducing specific features of the borocarbides\nbut a general understanding of the interplay of pairing and\nmagnetic correlations, even in this simple model, appears to be\nlacking.\n\nIn particular one would have liked to know (i)~how the\nmagnetic ground state is affected by pairing, (ii)~the \nattraction and Kondo coupling window over which superconductivity\ncoexists with magnetic order, and (iii)~the spectral features\nof the system, given that pairing now occurs between magnetic\nBloch states, and not simply ${\\bf k}\\uparrow$ and $-{\\bf k} \n\\downarrow$, and can lead to anisotropic gaps, and even a \ngapless state.\n\nIn this paper we report on the ground state of a \nmodel with s-wave pairing tendency (local attractive\ninteraction) in the presence of a local moment lattice.\nIf the magnetic moments are large ($2S \\gg  1$) the\nquantum fluctuations of the local moments can be ignored \nto start with and \nthe Kondo effect itself is not relevant. Such a system\ncan be described by a Kondo lattice of \n`classical' spins coupled to the conduction electrons.\nThe parameter space of the problem is defined by \nelectron density $(n)$, attractive pairing interaction\n$(U)$, the `Kondo' coupling $(J)$, and temperature\n$(T)$. Most of the results in this paper pertain to\nthe ground state, the finite \ntemperature phase competition will be \ndiscussed elsewhere.\nOur main results are the following\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\n{\\it Magnetic ground state:}\nThe magnetic ground state depends only weakly on the pairing interaction\nand is determined mainly by the electron density and Kondo\ncoupling, consistent with the suggestions of Anderson and Suhl \n\\cite{and-suhl} made originally in the weak coupling context.\n\\item\n{\\it Superconducting order:}\nAt weak Kondo coupling the pairing order parameter increases monotonically \nas $n$ varies from $[0,1]$ but beyond a critical coupling the $n=1$\nstate loses superconductivity, while it survives for $n \\neq 1$ to almost \ntwice  the coupling.\n\\item\n{\\it Gapless state:} Although the pairing amplitude\nis essentially homogeneous, for $n \\neq 1$ the superconductor\nbecomes gapless at a coupling $J_{g}(n,U)$ that is roughly\nhalf of the critical coupling, $J_c(n,U)$, needed for\ndestroying superconductivity.  At $n=1$ the superconductor \nremains gapped despite the magnetic order.\n\\item\n{\\it Quasiparticles and density of states:}\nSuperconductivity in a generic `spiral' magnetic\nbackground leads to a dispersion with upto eight branches, some \nof which cross the Fermi level for $J > J_g$.\nThe associated density of states shows multiple van Hove\nsingularities and the low energy spectral weight maps out\na `Fermi surface' even in the superconducting state.\n\\item\n{\\it Comparison with experiments:}\nOur ground state is consistent with observations in the borocarbides\nand suggest that the superconducting gap in DyNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C and\nHoNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C could be strongly anisotropic.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows, in \nSection II we discuss our  model and the numerical \nmethods.  Section III discusses our results on the phase \ndiagram and spectral features obtained within a\nrestricted variational scheme in two dimensions. \nSection IV compares these results to that from a Monte Carlo\nbased unrestricted minimization, comments on extensions to\na wider interaction window, and compares our results to\nexperiments on the borocarbides.\n\n\\section{Model and method}\n\nWe study the attractive Hubbard model in two dimension\non a square lattice in presence of Kondo like coupling:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nH = H_{0} - \\vert  U \\vert  \\sum_{i}n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}  -\nJ \\sum_{i}{\\bf S}_{i}.{\\bf \\sigma}_{i}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H=H_{0}-|U|\\sum_{i}n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}-J\\sum_{i}{\\bf S}_{i}.{\\bf%&#10;\\sigma}_{i}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></munder><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2191</mo><mi/></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2193</mo><mi/></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></munder><msub><mi>\ud835\udc12</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05730.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere, $\\sum_{i}\\frac{\\vert \\Delta_{i}\\vert^{2}}{U}$ is the stiffness\nassociated with the pairing field.\nThe configurations $\\{\\Delta_i, {\\bf S}_i \\}$ \nthat need to be considered \nfollow the Boltzmann distribution, obtained by tracing over the\nelectrons:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13732, "prevtext": "\n\nwith, $ H_0 =  \\sum_{ij, \\sigma}(t_{ij} - \\mu \\delta_{ij}) \nc_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{j\\sigma}$, where $t_{ij}=-t$ for  \nnearest neighbor hopping and is zero otherwise. \n${\\bf S}_{i}$ is the core spin, arising from $f$ levels,\nfor example, in a real material. \n${\\bf \\sigma}_{i}$ is the electron \nspin operator.  $U$ is the attractive onsite interaction\n(with a physical origin in local electron-phonon\ncoupling).\nMost of the detailed results in this paper are \nat $U = 4t$, but we have also shown some\nresults at weaker $U/t$.\n\nThis paper focuses on the ground state, which can be\nreasonably accessed within mean field theory (MFT), but\nwe want to set up a scheme that can also access the interplay \nof magnetic and pairing fluctuations at\nfinite temperature in a situation where $U$ and $J$ are\ncomparable to $t$. \nWhile mean field theory can be extended to finite\ntemperature to access some thermal effects we want\na formulation which (i)~retains the effect\nof magnetic fluctuations on pairing, and (ii)~the effect\nof the changing low energy electron spectrum on magnetism.\nWith this in mind we set up a lattice field theory involving \nthe electrons and the magnetic and pairing degrees of freedom\nas follows.\n\nWe apply a single channel \nHubbard-Stratonovich decomposition to the attractive interaction \nin terms of an auxiliary complex scalar field \n$\\Delta_{i}(\\tau) = \\vert \\Delta_{i}(\\tau)\\vert e^{i\\theta_{i}(\\tau)}$. \nThis converts the `four fermion' term to quadratic fermions in an\narbitrary spacetime fluctuating pairing field.  \nOn the magnetic side we have a quantum \n`spin S' magnetic moment ${\\bf S}_i$ coupled to the \nelectrons. \n\nThis problem can be exactly  treated only via\nmethods like\nquantum Monte Carlo.

the RKKY interaction, and\n$J^{(4)}$, like $b_{ijkl}$, involves a four Fermi cumulant.\n$c_{ijkl}$ can be constructed again from a combination of\nfour Green's functions. \\\\\nThe terms above define a relatively\nlow order classical field theory on a lattice. \n$H_{\\Delta}$  involve the first two terms in the\nsuperconducting Ginzburg-Landau \ntheory, and $H_J$ describes the leading interaction coupling\nmagnetic moments. $H_{\\Delta,J}$ indicates how the two orders\nmodify each other.\nAll of this holds when $\\Delta_i$ and $J{\\bf S}_i$ \nare $\\lesssim t$.\n\nFor large and random $\\{\\Delta_i, J{\\bf S}_i \\}$ \nthe fermion trace can only be evaluated numerically. \nWe use two strategies: \n(i)~When considering $T=0$, as in this paper, we can restrict ourselves to\n{\\it periodic} configurations\nof $\\{\\Delta_i, {\\bf S}_i \\}$ and in that case we only need to \nestimate the energy of $H_{eff}$ for periodic pairing/magnetic\nbackgrounds, accomplished readily through the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\n(BdG) scheme as we discuss below.\n(ii)~When considering finite temperature,\nwhere fluctuations are essential, we generate equilibrium configurations \nby using the Metropolis algorithm for the $\\{\\Delta_i, {\\bf S}_i \\}$\nand estimate the `update cost' by diagonalizing the \nelectron Hamiltonian $H_{eff}$\nfor every microscopic move.\nNeedless to say this is a numerically expensive process. \n\n\\subsection{Variational scheme}\n\nAs $T \\rightarrow 0$ the classical fluctuations die off and \nthe fields ${\\bf S}_i$ and $\\Delta_i$ should be\nchosen to minimize the energy.\nAn unrestricted real space minimization is still a non trivial\ntask but we choose to minimize the energy using a restricted\nfamily of $\\{{\\bf S}_i, \\Delta_i\\}$ configurations, described\nbelow, and check the quality of the result via Monte Carlo\nbased simulated annealing.\nSpecifically, we assume \n$\\Delta_i = \\Delta_0$, a site independent real quantity, and\nfor the magnetic order we consider \nspiral configurations where the polar angle $\\alpha_i = \\pi/2$ and\nthe azimuthal angle $\\phi_{i}$ is periodic:\n$ S_{zi}  =  0,~\nS_{xi} = cos({\\bf q}.{\\bf r}_i),~\nS_{yi}  =  sin({\\bf q}.{\\bf r}_i) $. \nThe allowed wavevectors  $\\{ q_x,q_y \\}$\nare of the form $  2n\\pi/L$, where \n($n=1,2,3...$).\nWe minimize the energy over\n$\\{ q_x,q_y \\} $ and $\\Delta_{0}$ for a fixed\n$\\mu$, $J$ and $U$.\nA further lowering of energy is possible if\na periodic component is superposed\non $\\Delta_0$ but this non-uniform component is\nsmall in the parameter space we explore\n\\cite{buzdin1985}.\n\nThe variational scheme was tested on sizes upto $30 \\times 30$\nand give stable results for $U \\gtrsim 2t$. Although the VC is\ndoable for larger sizes we did not attempt that since we\nwanted comparison with a Monte Carlo based minimization\n(see below).\n\n\\subsection{Unrestricted minimization}\n\nIn addition to the variational scheme we have employed \nthe Monte Carlo technique as a simulated annealing tool \nto obtain the ground state, without imposing any\nperiodicity on the spins or any homogeneity on the\n$\\Delta_i$.  For this the system is cooled down \nfrom an uncorrelated high temperature state.\nOwing to the computational cost in diagonalizing the \n$ 4L^2 \\times 4L^2$ matrix involved in this study most \nof the Monte Carlo \nsimulations are done on system size $16 \\times 16$, \nand some on $24 \\times 24$.\n\nIn the discussion section we\ncompare the ground state phase diagram  obtained through \nour restricted variational scheme with that obtained through \nthe `unrestricted' minimization via Monte Carlo.\nThe \nagreement is reasonable and for the moment we focus on the\nvariation based phase diagrams.\n\n\\subsection{Green's function for the spectrum}\n\nWithin the variational scheme the magnetic-superconducting\nbackground has a translational symmetry so the corresponding\nelectron problem can be diagonalised in momentum and spin\nspace. For a given ${\\bf k}$ the \nBdG problem in the periodic\nbackground involves a $8 \\times 8$ matrix and it is\ndifficult to extract information about the eigenvalues,\nand the resulting density of states, analytically. \n\nHowever, if $\\Delta_0,~J \\ll zt$, where the coordination \nnumber $z=4$ in 2D, one can set up a useful low order\napproximation for the Green's function of the electron.\nFor an electron propagating with momentum ${\\bf k}$ \nand spin up, the magnetic scattering connects it to\nan electron state with ${\\bf k} + {\\bf Q}, \\downarrow$,\nwhile the pairing field connects it to a hole with\n$-{\\bf k}, \\downarrow$. The matrix elements are,\nrespectively, $J$ and $\\Delta_0$. This leads to the\nthe Green's function:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nG_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, i\\omega_n)\n& =&  {1 \\over {i \\omega_n - (\\epsilon({\\bf k}) -\\mu) \n- \\Sigma_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, i\\omega_n)}} \\cr\n~~&&\\cr\n~~&&\\cr\n\\Sigma_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, i\\omega_n) & = & \n{\\Delta_0^2 \\over {i \\omega_n + (\\epsilon({\\bf k}) -\\mu)}}\n+ {J^2 \\over {i \\omega_n - (\\epsilon({\\bf k} + {\\bf Q}) -\\mu)}} \n\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\epsilon({\\bf k}) = - 2t(cos(k_x) + cos(k_y))$.\nThe self energy of course has higher order terms involving $J^2 \\Delta_0^2$,\n{\\it etc}, but the form above is surprisingly accurate except at $n=1$.\nWe can extract the spectral function $A_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, \\omega)\n= -(1/\\pi) Im~G_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, \\omega + i \\eta)\n\\vert_{\\eta \\rightarrow 0} $. A similar expression can be used for\n$ A_{\\downarrow \\downarrow}({\\bf k}, \\omega) $.\nWe discuss the comparison of these results with full BdG later on.\n\n\\subsection{Computation of observable}\n\nAt $T=0$ for a fixed choice of $U$, $J$ and $\\mu$ \nthe state is characterized by \nthe pairing order parameter $\\Delta_0$ and the magnetic\nwavevector ${\\hat x}Q_x + {\\hat y} Q_y$. These are\ndetermined by energy minimization. In this periodic \nbackground we\ncompute the following:\n(i)~the spin and momentum resolved spectral function,\n$A_{\\sigma \\sigma }({\\bf k}, \\omega)$, from a \nknowledge of the BdG eigenvalues and eigenfunctions,\n(ii)~the total electronic density of states $N(\\omega)\n= \\sum_{{\\bf k}, \\omega} A_{\\sigma \\sigma }({\\bf k}, \\omega)$,\n(iii)~the overall gap, from the minimum eigenvalue in the\nBdG spectrum, (iv)~momentum dependence of the $\\omega = 0$\nspectral weight, $ \\sum_{\\sigma}\nA_{\\sigma \\sigma }({\\bf k}, 0)$, mapping out the\n`Fermi surface' in the superconductor.\n\nWhile the numerical results for these are based on the \nfull BdG numeric, we use the simple Green's function\nscheme outlined earlier to explain the physical basis\nof the effects.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n \\centerline{\n \\includegraphics[height=6cm,width=4.5cm,angle=0]{en_qq}\n \\includegraphics[height=6cm,width=4.5cm,angle=0]{en_qpi}\n }\n\\caption{Color online: Dependence of the energy on the\npairing field, at $U = 4t$, $J = 1.0t$ and $n \\sim 0.4$,\nfor magnetic wavevectors ${\\bf q} = (q_x,q_y)$.\n(a)~${\\bf q} =  \\{q, q \\}$ and (b) $\\{q, \\pi\\}$.\nThe optimized state\nis obtained by computing the energy for all possible\n${\\bf q}$ in the Brillouin zone.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=5.0cm,width=6.5cm,angle=0]{delta_J} }\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=5.0cm,width=6.5cm,angle=0]{qx_J} }\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=5.0cm,width=6.5cm,angle=0]{qy_J} }\n\\caption{Color online:\nFilling dependence of\nthe optimized\n(a)~pairing field amplitude\n$\\Delta_{0}$ and (b)-(c)~components of the magnetic\nwavevector ${\\bf Q}$, at different\nmagnetic interactions $J/t$, and density $n$,\nfor $U/t = 4$.

The results here are for $U=4t$, we will\ndiscuss the phase diagram at other values of $U$ later.\n\nIncrease in magnetic \ncoupling suppresses the pairing field amplitude. \nAt a scale $J_c(n)$ \nthe pairing amplitude vanishes, indicating \nthe destruction of the superconducting phase. \nWe make a few observations:\n(1)~$J_c(n)$ vanishes as $n \\rightarrow 0$, and it   \nincreases with $n$ with a maximum at $n \\sim 0.6$ at\n$U=4$. This maximum, $J_c^{max}$, $ \\sim 1.5t$.\n(2)~The critical\nvalue at $n=1$ is much smaller, with $J_c(n=1) \\sim 0.75t$.\n(3)~The transition with increasing $J$ is first order at \n$n=1$ and second order for $n \\neq 1$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n \\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm,width=5.5cm,angle=0]{dos_n0p3}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm,width=5.5cm,angle=0]{dos_n0p5}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm,width=5.5cm,angle=0]{dos_n1p0}\n}\n\\caption{Color online:\nElectronic density of states\nat different filling and magnetic coupling at $U=4t$,\non magnetic-superconducting\nbackgrounds obtained through the variational scheme.\nFor $n=0.3$ (panel (a)) and $n=0.5$ (panel (b))\nthe DOS shows transition from a\ngapped to a gapless superconducting\nstate at some  coupling $J_g(n)$.\nAt $n=1$ the system remains gapped throughout,\nhowever, there is a nonmonotonicity in the behavior\nof the gap as one transits from the magnetic\nsuperconductor to the\nmagnetic insulator at a critical value $J_{c} \\sim 0.75t$.\n}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nFig.2(b) and 2(c) shows the components of the corresponding magnetic\nwave vectors. In the absence of pairing, and at low $J$, the\nmagnetic order is decided by the RKKY interaction, with the \npeak in the band susceptibility $\\chi_0({\\bf q})$ dictating\nthe ordering wavevector ${\\bf Q}$.\nAt larger $J$ the spiral states gradually give way to\ncollinear phases and finally to just two phases,\nferromagnetic and Neel, with a window of phase\nseparation in between.\nIn the presence of a pairing interaction it is not\nessential that the same trend be followed but, as \npointed out long back by Anderson and Suhl \\cite{and-suhl}, the\npresence of pairing affects the electronic density\nof states only over a window $2 \\Delta_0 \\ll \\epsilon_F$\nso except for ${\\bf q} \\rightarrow 0$ the spin susceptibility\nis mostly unaffected. \n\nOur results are at $U=4t$ with the  pairing\nfield $\\Delta_0 \\sim t$ so the density of states is affected\nover a fairly wide window. Nevertheless, except near $n=1$,\nthe RKKY trend still holds at small $J$. The phase diagrams\nin Fig.3 quantify these further.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{$n-J$ phase diagrams}\n\nFig.3 shows the ground state phase diagram obtained \nthrough our variational calculations.\nThe $U = 0$ situation, panel (a),\ncorresponds to just the \nclassical Kondo lattice in two dimensions.\nWith respect to this non superconducting reference,\n(b) and (c) show the impact of increasing pairing\ninteraction on the magnetic state as well as the\nincreasing window of superconducting order.\nWe discuss the three cases separately.\n\n{\\bf (i)}~{\\it No pairing interaction $(U=0)$:}\nIn this case $\\Delta_0 =0$ and the ground state is\ncharacterized only by ${\\bf Q}$. We discuss\nthe $J/t \\rightarrow 0$ and the $J/t \\gtrsim 1$ \nlimits separately.\n\nThe small $J/t$ limit is controlled by\nthe RKKY interaction with the effective spin-spin\ncoupling being  $J_{ij} \\propto J^2 \\chi^0_{ij}$, \nwhere $\\chi^0_{ij}$ is the non local band\nsusceptibility of the conduction electrons. \nThe ordering wavevector is dictated by the\nmaximum in $\\chi^0({\\bf q})$, the Fourier\ntransform of $\\chi^0_{ij}$. This depends on $\\mu$,\nor the filling $n$. \nThe system evolves from\na ${\\bf Q} = \\{0,0\\}$ (ferromagnet) at low filling,\nto a $\\{0,  q\\}$ phase at the intermediate filling. \nFurther increase in \nfilling leads to a $\\{0, \\pi\\}$ antiferromagnet, followed \nby a $\\{q, \\pi\\}$ phase and then to a  $\\{\\pi, \\pi\\}$ Neel\nantiferromagnet at half filling $n=1$. There are no\nphase separation windows in the $J/t \\rightarrow 0$ \nlimit and all transitions are second order.\n\n\nFor $J/t \\gtrsim 1$ the {\\it sequence} of magnetic phases,\nwith increasing filling, remains the same as at weak \ncoupling but the window of\nspiral states shrink yielding to the FM state at low density\nand a window of phase separation near $n=1$. For $J/t \\gg 1$\n(not shown in the figure) the only surviving states are\nthe ferromagnet and the $n=1$ Neel state, separated by a\nphase separation window. The system heads towards the\n`double exchange' limit.\n\n{\\bf (ii)}~{\\it Weak attraction $(U \\sim t)$:}\nOn a finite lattice the finite size gap $\\sim t/L^2$ (in 2D) \nmakes it difficult to stabilize a superconducting state below\na $L$ dependent scale.  Since we are using a real space\nframework, to connect up with finite $T$ Monte Carlo\ncalculations later, we have only limited data at $U < 2t$.\nFig.3(b) shows results at $U=2t$ as typical of\n`weak coupling'.\n\nAt $U=2t$ and $J=0$ we have the usual ${\\bf k},\\uparrow,~-{\\bf k}, \n\\downarrow$\npairing. \nAt finite $J$ one would (a)~expect the magnetic order to be modified\nsince the effective spin-spin interaction is now in a finite\n$\\Delta_0$ background, and (b)~the superconductivity to be weakened\nsince the pairing is no longer between ${\\bf k},\\uparrow,~-{\\bf k}, \n\\downarrow$ but the states \n${\\bf k},{\\uparrow}$ and $ - {\\bf k} + {\\bf Q},{\\downarrow}$, \nwhere ${\\bf Q}$ is the magnetic ordering vector. \n\nThe first effect is weak since the maximum $\\Delta_0 \\sim 0.4t$,\nopening  only a modest gap in the density of states with \nlimited impact on the spin-spin interaction. So the magnetic\ncharacter {\\it within} the superconducting window, Fig.3(b),\nis very similar to the $U=0$ case. The $\\Delta_0$ however\nfalls with increasing $J$, surviving to a scale $J_c(n)$ \nshown in the panel. The maximum of  $J_c$ occurs at $n \\sim 0.8$\nand the value at $n=1$ is lower than that. \nIn the regime $\\Delta_0=0$ the magnetic phases are of course as\nin panel (a).\n\n\n{\\bf (iii)}~{\\it Intermediate attraction  $(U \\gg t)$:}\nPanel (c) shows data at $U=4t$ and the $\\Delta_0 $ at \n$n \\sim 0.8$ is now $1.4t$, much larger than at $U=2t$.\nAs a result, the electronic density of states is\nmodified with respect to its band character over a wide \nenergy window. \n\nThe changed density of states changes\nthe spin-spin coupling  and the magnetic phases\nshow clear differences with respect to the small $U$\ncases. These include changes in the magnetic phase\nboundaries within the SC phase and the emergence of\na window of Neel order with ${\\bf Q} = (\\pi, \\pi)$,  \nclose to $n=1$. \n\nSuperconducting order survives \nover a wider range of magnetic coupling with the maximum\n$J_c$ being $\\sim 1.5t$, occurring at $n \\sim 0.6$. Beyond\n$n \\sim 0.6$ there is a quick drop in $J_c$\nas a phase separation window intervenes. The $J_c$ \nat $n=1$ is $\\sim 0.75t$, well below the maximum \nat $n \\sim 0.6$.\n\n\\subsection{Quasiparticle properties}\nThe magnetic superconducting state involves a suppression\nof $\\Delta_0$ as $J$ increases. Had the\npairing been between the usual $\\vert {\\bf k} \\uparrow \\rangle$\nand $\\vert - {\\bf k} \\downarrow \\rangle$ states it would\nhave led to a suppressed BCS gap with the overall character\nof the density of states (DOS) remaining unchanged. However,\nthe pairing now takes place in a magnetic background, where the\nBloch states are superposition of $\\vert {\\bf k} \\uparrow \\rangle$\nand $\\vert {\\bf k} + {\\bf Q}  \\downarrow \\rangle$. The {\\it combination\n} of pairing\nand magnetic interaction now connect a larger set of states.\nFor example $\\vert {\\bf k} \\uparrow \\rangle$\nconnects to $\\vert {\\bf k} + {\\bf Q}  \\downarrow \\rangle$,\n$\\vert - {\\bf k} - {\\bf Q}  \\uparrow \\rangle$, and \n$\\vert - {\\bf k} \\downarrow \\rangle$.\nThe eigenspectrum that emerges need no longer look like\nthe `BCS' result. In the section below we describe\nthe features that we observe and in the section\nafter we try to analyze these features in terms of the\napproximate Green's function theory.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=4.5cm,angle=0]{gap_J}\n\\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=4.5cm,angle=0]{U4-vc-gs2}\n}\n\\caption{Color online:\n(a)~Gap in the DOS plotted as a function of magnetic\ncoupling for different fillings.

The spectrum is gapped at all magnetic \ncoupling but the gap shows nonmonotonic behavior. Initially\nincrease in \nmagnetic coupling pushes the satellite peaks  \nto low energy  narrowing the gap. However the pairing amplitude itself\nvanishes at a critical $J \\sim 0.75t$, beyond which the system changes to\na magnetic insulator - with the gap now being proportional to and \nsustained by $J$.\n}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Gapped and gapless regimes}\n\nFig.5(a) shows the $J$ dependence of the gap at \ndifferent filling. At weak magnetic coupling \nthe superconducting gap follows the behavior of the pairing \nfield amplitude and undergoes suppression with increasing \n$J$. At half filling, till a coupling of $J \\sim 0.9t$\nthe behavior of the gap is the same as that of its low filling\ncounterpart. For  $J \\gtrsim 0.9t$ the gap increases linearly with \n$J$. The gap in this regime arises from antiferromagnetic \n($\\pi, \\pi$) order.\nFor $n \\neq 1$ the gap vanishes at a scale we call $J_g(n)$.\n\nFig.5(b) shows the $n-J$ phase diagram at $U=4t$, now with \nthe superconducting phase demarcated into gapped \nand gapless regimes. The gapped regime is characterized \nby the presence of large $\\Delta_0$ while the\ngapless window has relatively smaller $\\Delta_0$. That by \nitself does not explain why the qualitative character of the\nDOS changes, so we examine the electron dispersion in the\nmagnetic superconductor to explore this issue.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Electron dispersion}\n\nFig.6 shows the momentum \nresolved spectral function $A({\\bf k}, \\omega)\n= \\sum_{\\sigma} A_{\\sigma}({\\bf k}, \\omega)$ for three\ndifferent\n$n-J$ combinations. The momentum scan is along the\ndiagonal of the Brillouin zone, ${\\bf k} =\n(0,0) \\rightarrow (\\pi,\\pi)$.\nSince the spectra are computed on an\nordered state there is no broadening of the lines and\nwe essentially map out the multi-branch dispersion in\nthe magnetic-superconducting state.\n\nWe begin with $n=1$, top row. At weak magnetic coupling,\n$J = 0.25t$, the behavior is BCS like with the \ncharacteristic {\\it back bending} feature in the dispersion curves. \nThe effective gap is slightly reduced compared \nto its BCS value, and there is a small branching visible\nfor ${\\bf k} \\sim (\\pi/2,\\pi/2)$.\nAt $J=0.75t$ the branching feature is far more prominent\nand the separation between the inner branches, that sets\nthe gap, is much smaller than at $J=0.25t$. \n${\\bf k}$ regions associated with \n${\\partial E_{\\alpha}({\\bf k})}/{\\partial {\\bf k}}=0$,\nwhere $E_{\\alpha}({\\bf k})$ are the dispersion,\nlead to the van Hove singularities\nobserved in Fig.4(c).\n\nAt $n = 0.5$, middle row, weak $J$ essentially reproduces\nthe BCS result, with a smaller gap than $n=1$ due to\nthe smaller $\\Delta_0$ - occurring at a lower ${\\bf k}$\ndue to the lower filling.\nAt $J = 0.75t$ a very complex picture emerges, with in\nprinciple all the 8 bands that arise from BdG being \nvisible (although a six band, Green's function based,\napproach captures the essential features). Along the\n$(0,0) \\rightarrow (\\pi,\\pi)$ scan one of the bands\nseems to cross $\\omega=0$. The multiple and\nprominent $E_{\\alpha}({\\bf k})$ generate the van Hove\nsingularity structure seen in Fig.4(b). At $J=1.25t$\nthe $\\Delta_0$ is very small and the features\nare similar to that of a magnetic metal.\n\nAt $n = 0.3$ the qualitative features are similar to\n$n=0.5$ although the multiple bands are not all visible\nfor the color scheme that we have used.\nThe superconducting state survives to $J_c \\sim t$ and the\n$J =1.25t$ result is for a magnetic metal.\n\nWhile it is difficult to extract useful analytic expressions\nfor the three branches of the dispersion from each\n$G_{\\sigma\\sigma}({\\bf k}, \\omega)$, explicit\nfunctional forms can be obtained in the gapless phase\nwhen $\\Delta_0 \\lesssim J$. We provide these results in\nthe Appendix, and have cross checked them with respect\nto the numerical results.\n\n\\subsubsection{Low energy weight distribution}\n\nIn connection to the spectral features discussed above in Fig.7\nwe show the distribution of low energy spectral weight \nacross the Brillouin zone at low and intermediate filling (at\n$n=1$ the spectrum is always gapped). At weak \nmagnetic coupling the spectrum is gapped out and thus there is \nno low energy weight. \n\nWe computed the ${\\bf k}$ dependent spectral weight at\n$\\omega =0$,\nsummed over spin channels, $A({\\bf k}, 0) = \\sum_{\\sigma}\nA_{\\sigma\\sigma}({\\bf k}, \\omega)$, where: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nA_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, 0)\n& =& -(1/\\pi) Im~{1 \\over {i \\eta - (\\epsilon({\\bf k}) -\\mu) \n- \\Sigma_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, i \\eta)}} \n\\vert_{\\eta \\rightarrow 0} \\cr\n~~&&\\cr\n~~&&\\cr\n\\Sigma_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, i\\eta) & = &\n{\\Delta_0^2 \\over {i \\eta  + (\\epsilon({\\bf k}) -\\mu)}}\n+ {J^2 \\over {i \\eta - (\\epsilon({\\bf k} + {\\bf Q}) -\\mu)}}\n\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\netc. The results in Fig.7 highlight the rather strange\nlooking `Fermi surface' that emerge. The low $J$ panels\nshow no spectral weight since the system is gapped. \n$J=t$ shows non trivial Fermi surfaces in the superconductor,\ndictated by the magnetic wavevector, while\n$J=1.25t$ is superconducting for $n=0.5$ and \na magnetic metal for $n=0.3$.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThis section covers some issues of method, related to the approximations\nthat we have made in handling the model in Eqn.1, and the phase diagram,\nin terms of the magnetic coupling and attractive interaction. We\ncomment on what it suggests for spectral features in the borocarbides.\n\n\\subsection{Computational issues}\n\n\\subsubsection{The `classical' approximations}\n\nThe model in Eqn.1 involves an attractive electron-electron\ninteraction $U$ and the coupling $J$ between the electron\nspin and a local moment of spin $S$. This describes\ninteractions between quantum degrees of freedom, and, beyond\nweak coupling, is very non trivial. \nThe treatment of the Hubbard interaction in terms of a\nclassical pairing field, and of the spin $S$ as\nclassical, makes the model tractable by reducing it to\na variational problem determining a static $\\{\\Delta_i, {\\bf S}_i\\}$\nbackground that minimizes the electron energy.\n \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\includegraphics[height=8.0cm,width=9.0cm,angle=0]{mag-sf-mc-gs}\n\\caption{Color online:\nMagnetic structure factor at $T \\sim 0$ for different filling and \nmagnetic interaction $J$.

At the \nintermediate filling of $n = 0.6$ a $(0, \\pi)$ and a $(q, \\pi)$ state \nis realized for the particular choice of the magnetic coupling, in \nagreement with the VC results. At low filling of $n = 0.3$ and \nintermediate and strong magnetic coupling the state as obtained \nthrough MC slightly deviates from that obtained through the VC, with\nthe $(0, q)$ being now replaced by $(0, \\pi)$, the neighboring\nphase in the VC phase diagram.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n \\centerline{\n \\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=4.5cm,angle=0]{nj_pd}\n \\includegraphics[height=5cm,width=4.5cm,angle=0]{U4-mc-gs}\n }\n \\caption{Color online:\nThe ground state $n-J$ phase diagram as obtained\n through MC (right) in comparison to the one obtained through\n the variational calculation (left) at $U = 4t$.

The emergence of the Neel,\n $(\\pi, \\pi)$ antiferromagnetic window near $n = 1$ is verified\n through the MC as well.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe classical/mean field approximation for $U$ makes qualitative\nsense as long as there is order in the ground state. The presence\nof order at $J=0$ is well known, the persistence of order at small\n$J$ has also been established via numerically exact methods. This\nsuggests that the mean field treatment of $U$  is a valid\nfirst approximation. The treatment of the local moment as\n`classical' is valid when $2S \\gg 1$. For the borocarbides\n$4f$ shells for the magnetic superconductors involve $2S \\sim 3-5$\nand the classical treatment again ought to be reasonable.\nThere are, however, low moment, and non magnetic, superconductors\ninvolving Tm and Lu which {\\it cannot} be captured well \nwithin our scheme.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Comparison with unrestricted minimization}\n\nFig.8 shows the magnetic structure factor computed at\ndifferent filling for three different regimes of the\nmagnetic interaction. In the intermediate and strong\ncoupling regimes, cooling down the system from\nan uncorrelated high temperature state reproduces the\nmagnetic order as has been obtained through the\nvariational calculations. In the weak interaction\nregime however, the system fails to attain the\nglobal minimum in the energy landscape within\nthe limited annealing time and finite system size. The\nconfiguration thus obtained through the Monte\nCarlo is often energetically unfavorable compared\nto the one obtained variationally.\nNevertheless, over a wide parameter space the\nvariational ground state is well reproduced on cooling\ndown from a high temperature state.\n\nThe resulting ground state phase diagram\nis shown in Fig.9, in comparison to the one obtained\nthrough the variational scheme. The ground state as\nobtained through the Monte Carlo certainly agrees\nqualitatively with all features of the\nvariational result, and also confirms that the\n`homogeneous $\\Delta_i$ assumption for the\nground state is not unreasonable.\n\n\\subsubsection{Size limitations}\n\nThe variational calculation, when cast in momentum space,\ndoes not have significant size limitations, except in the\nnumber of ${\\bf q}$ values over which the energy has\nto be minimized. \n\nA more serious size limitation arises when \nMonte Carlo based simulated \nannealing is used for `unrestricted' minimization, and \nfor accessing finite temperature properties.\nThis requires iterative diagonalization of a \n$4N \\times 4N$ matrix (where $N = L^2$) and even when a\ncluster algorithm is used for the MC updates only sizes\nupto $24 \\times 24$ can be accessed within reasonable\ntime. We have checked that thermodynamic properties can\nbe accessed down to $U=2t$ reliably on these sizes, but\nthe subtle spectral features that one observes in the\nlarge size ground state calculations cannot be \nresolved well on these sizes. We also cannot go\ndown to $U \\sim t$, which we believe is appropriate\nfor quantitative description of the borocarbides.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Benchmarking the Green's function results}\n\nThe BdG problem generates 8 bands for a given ${\\bf k}$\nsince each $\\vert {\\bf k} \\sigma \\rangle $ connects to\nthree other states via pairing and magnetic scattering,\nand the results for $\\sigma = \\uparrow$ and $\\sigma = \\downarrow$ \nare now non degenerate.  Some of the residues associated with\nthese bands can, however, be quite small and hard to\nidentify. The Green's function approach on the other\nhand truncates the scattering processes to\n$J^2$ and $\\Delta_0^2$, dropping $J^2 \\Delta_0^2$, and\nthe resulting Green's function has three poles for\neach ${\\bf k} \\sigma$. \nThe results are obviously exact at $J=0$ or $\\Delta_0 =0$,\nbut, as the results in Fig.10 show, they are surprisingly\naccurate over a large $\\Delta_0-J-n$ parameter range.\n\nThe results however are {\\it not} accurate for the\nmagnetic superconductor at $n=1$ where\nan unusual DOS emerges (see Fig.4(c)) and also\nat low $J$ at other densities where a spurious\nlow energy band with a small residue, $\\propto J^2$,\nemerges. Away from these parameters the Green's function\napproach provides a useful tool for understanding\nthe complex band structure.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n \\centerline{\n \\includegraphics[height=11.5cm,width=8.5cm,angle=0]{spectral-benchmark}\n }\n\\caption{Color online:\nComparison of the total spectral function $A({\\bf k}, \\omega)$\nobtained from the BdG diagonalization and\nthe Green's function method, for parameters\nmentioned in the figure.

However\nit is worth exploring if a gapless superconducting phase \ncan  arise at much lower $U$, and therefore much smaller\n$\\Delta_0$, than we have studied till now. This will be\nrelevant for real materials which are mainly in the \nweak coupling, $U \\lesssim t$, limit.\nIn Fig.11(a) and 11(b) we show the DOS  calculated through \nthe Green's function method for typical spiral magnetic \nbackgrounds, with  ${\\bf Q}$ marked in the Fig,\nand pairing field amplitude set to\n$\\Delta_{0} = 0.2t$. We study both the two dimensional and\nthree dimensional case (which is experimentally more\nrelevant) and find that all cases show a gapped to\ngapless transition with increasing $J$ on a scale\n$J_g \\sim \\Delta_0$. \n\nThis little demonstration is just meant to emphasize\nthat the occurrence of a gapless phase at finite $\\Delta_0$\nis not an artifact of large $U$ or two dimensionality\nand can well occur in weak coupling 3D superconductors\nas well.\n\n\n\\subsection{Relating to experiments}\n\n\\subsubsection{$U-J$ phase diagram}\n\nThe results at $U = 4t$ are part of a larger $U-J-\\mu$ \nphase diagram.\nIn real solids the attractive interaction would be\ntypically much smaller that $4t$ (and in\npossible cold atomic systems they could be larger).\nKeeping this in mind we attempted to map out the $U-J$\nphase diagram at a few densities.\nFig.12, top row,\n shows our results at $n \\sim 0.5$ and $n \\sim 0.3$.\n\nWe find the following:\n(i)~At $n \\sim 0.5$ over the range of\n$U$ the system exhibits G-type antiferromagnetic order ($\\pi, \\pi$)\nor ($q, \\pi$) order depending upon $J$.\nThe superconducting phase makes a gapped to gapless transition\nat a $J$ that increases with $U$.\n(ii)~At $n = 0.3$ the magnetic state can be\n($\\pi, \\pi$),\n($q, \\pi$) or ($0, \\pi$). The superconducting state is gapped\nor gapless depending upon the strength of the magnetic interaction,\nwith the large $U \\gg J$ regime favoring gapped superconductivity.\nThe $J \\gtrsim U$ regime\nagain gives rise to gapless SC and finally a magnetic metal.\nNo phase separated regime is realized at low filling.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=5.2cm,width=4.4cm,angle=0]{U-J-pd-mu1p5}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.2cm,width=4.4cm,angle=0]{U-J-pd-mu2p5}\n}\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=5.2cm,width=4.4cm,angle=0]{expt_scaled_pd}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.2cm,width=4.4cm,angle=0]{U-J-theory-n0p5}\n}\n\\caption{Color online: \n(a)-(b) Ground state $U-J$ phase diagram at\n$n \\sim 0.50$ (panel (a)) and  $n \\sim 0.3$ (panel (b)).\n(c)~Organization of the borocarbide ground state in terms\nof the de Gennes (DG) factor, ${S(S+1)}$, denoting the\nstrength of local electron-spin coupling, and the Hopfield\nparameter, $\\eta$, indicative of the strength of pairing interaction.\nThe DG factor is like our $(JS)^2$, while $\\eta$ relates to $U$.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The borocarbide phase diagram}\n\nIn the borocarbides neutron scattering experiments reveal \nthe nature of magnetic order. There is an overall\nsimilarity in the order as one goes down\nfrom GdNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, where the DG factor is largest,\nto TmNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, where the DG factor is smallest,\nthrough  DyNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C,  HoNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, {\\it etc}.\nAll of them seem to have a ${\\bf Q} = (0,0,q)$ pattern\nof ordering, with $q \\sim 0.55$. The order is \nferromagnetic  in the basal plane with a spiral along\nthe $c$-axis \\cite{lynn1997}.  \n\nTwo material parameters are believed to be important in these \ncompounds. They are (i)~the  de-Gennes factor (DG) that we have \nalready introduced, proportional roughly to our $(JS)^2$, and \n(ii)~the `Hopfield parameter', $\\eta$, defined \\cite{michor2000}  \nas, $\\eta = N(E_{F})\\langle I_{\\alpha}^{2}\\rangle$, \nwhere $\\langle I_{\\alpha}^{2}\\rangle$ is average of \nthe electron-phonon matrix element over the atoms \nR, Ni, B, C, and $N(E_F)$ is the DOS\nat the Fermi level. $\\eta$ relates  roughly\nto $U$ in our case.  Both DG and $\\eta$ \nhave been tabulated for the borocarbides.\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n \\centerline{\n \\includegraphics[height=6.0cm,width=6.5cm,angle=0]{JT_n0p5}\n }\n \\caption{Color online: \n$J-T$ phase diagram at  $n = 0.5$.\n Magnetic coupling strongly suppresses the superconducting $T_{c}$\n and at intermediate coupling there is coexistence of the magnetic\n and superconducting order. In addition to the superconducting\n $T_{c}$ we show a magnetic scale $T_{AF}$ below which the correlation\nlength grows exponentially (but there is no true long range order\nsince we are in two dimensions). A third scale,\n $T_{g}$, showing the transition from a gapped \n to a gapless superconducting phase, emerges.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe organized the experimental phase diagram of the borocarbides\nin terms of $\\eta$ and DG (normalizing by the value for Gd),\nFig.12.(c), and compare it with our variational $U-J$ phase\ndiagram at a typical density $(n=0.5)$ in Fig.12.(d).\nFor the real materials the magnetic and superconducting \nboundaries are well established but the possible \n`gapped to gapless' boundary that we show in 12.(c) is our \nconjecture based on 12.(d). \nWe believe that \nunless the `multiband' character of the real materials\ninvalidates the basic picture there must be\nan increase in the gap anisotropy (if not a gapless\nstate) as one moves to increasing DG from\nEr $\\rightarrow$ Ho $\\rightarrow$ Dy, before \nsuperconductivity is lost in Tb.\nThere is indeed some evidence for gap anisotropy\nand nodal quasiparticles\nin the borocarbides, we review that quickly below.\n\nThe borocarbides studied involve two `non magnetic' \ncompounds, YNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C and LuNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C (which\ndo not have local moments), in addition to those with finite\n$4f$ moment and DG factor.\nAmong both the non magnetic and magnetic \nsuperconductors one observes an apparent \ndirection dependence of the gap \non the Fermi surface \\cite{canfield2003,izawa2002,takagi2004,shin2010, \nbaba2008,rybaltchencho1999,yanson2008,schultz2011}. \n\nIn case of YNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C and\nLuNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C scanning tunneling spectroscopy  (STS)\n\\cite{canfield2003}, c-axis thermal conductivity \\cite{izawa2002}, \nultrasound attenuation \\cite{takagi2004}, {\\it  etc.},\nsuggest that the superconducting \nenergy gap  is of the anisotropic s-wave type, \nwith point nodes along [100] and [010]. \nThe tunneling current in STS  \\cite{canfield2003}\nas well as the $\\sqrt{H}$ dependence of finite field \nheat capacity \\cite{izawa2002} suggests the \npresence of low energy quasiparticles.\nAngle resolved photoemmission spectroscopy (ARPES) \non YNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C suggests \\cite{shin2010}\nthat different parts of the Fermi surface contributes differently \ntowards to superconductivity.  These `non magnetic' compounds\nare expected to have strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations, \ndue to  Fermi surface nesting \\cite{kontani}, affecting\nthe pairing and gap anisotropy.\n\nOf the magnetic  superconductors,\nHoNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, ErNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C\nand TmNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, show\nconsiderable deviation of the gap from BCS behavior. \nPhotoemission spectroscopy  \n\\cite{baba2008} on ErNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, \npoint contact and Andreev reflection \n\\cite{rybaltchencho1999,yanson2008} \non HoNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C and \\cite{schultz2011} \nTmNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C suggest  gap anisotropy on \nindividual Fermi surface sheets, with magnitude variation\nbetween $1.1-1.7 $meV\nFor  ErNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C\nand TmNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C the deviations are visible even \nat the lowest temperature while in  HoNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, \nwhere $T_c > T_{AF}$, it is observed roughly above $T_{AF}$.\nExisting measurements \\cite{paul2000} \nsuggest that DyNi$_{2}$B$_{2}$C, which has $T_{AF} > T_c$,\ncan be described in terms of `BCS' behavior (inconsistent with\nwhat we suggest in Fig.12.(c)). We believe this\nmerits more careful probing.\n\n\\subsubsection{Thermal effects}\n\nSince this paper is focused on the ground state we did not use\nthe full power of the Monte Carlo method. The detailed\nfinite temperature properties will be discussed separately,\nhere we provide a glimpse of the finite temperature phase\ndiagram that emerges. \nBeyond the `mean field' effect of the diminished\nmagnetic and superconducting order\nat finite temperature one expects (i)~amplitude and phase\nfluctuations of the pairing field to suppress the gap \n(at low $J$) with increasing $T$, and (ii)~the gap suppression\neffect to be accelerated by the magnetic disorder which\nwould lead to strong spin flip scattering. \nThese effects require a treatment well beyond mean field\ntheory and our Boltzmann sampling of thermal \nconfigurations $\\{ \\Delta_i, {\\bf S}_i\\}$\naccomplishes that. The thermally generated disorder \nfeeds back into the electrons to modify spectral\nproperties.\n\nThe superconducting $T_c$ falls quickly for $J > 0.5t$\nand goes to zero at $J_c \\sim t$, while the low $J$ gap\nin the DOS closes at a scale $T_g$ that collapses at $J \\sim 0.7t$.\nWe note that there cannot be a finite $T_{AF}$ in a 2D \n${\\cal O}(3)$ invariant spin system, although the magnetic\ncorrelation length grows exponentially as $T$ is lowered\nbelow the indicated $T_{AF}$.\n \nThe data shown are at $U=4t$ where even \ncalculations on $16 \\times\n16$ lattices are reliable. We are working on lower $U$,\nwhich is physically more relevant, and will report the\nthermal properties soon.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have studied the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism \nin a two dimensional model involving an attractive Hubbard \ninteraction and a Kondo like coupling to local moments. \nThe ground state phase diagram is mapped out in terms of the \nattractive interaction, magnetic coupling, and electron filling. \nOver a range of magnetic coupling we observe a `gapless'\nsuperconducting state existing generally with non-collinear \nmagnetic order. For Neel order, superconductivity can \ncoexist with magnetism but we do not observe a gapless phase\nfor the bandstructure we have chosen. \nWe identify the origin of the gapless behavior in the \nparticipation of magnetic Bloch states in the pairing\nprocess. The combination of pairing and magnetic `scattering'\nleads to an effective `8 band' dispersion, with some bands\ncrossing the Fermi level at sufficiently large magnetic \ncoupling. An approximate Green's function analysis\nprovides insight on these new bands.\n\nThe Monte Carlo technique used here in a limited way also\ncaptures the thermal physics of the problem on fairly large lattices.\nWe have used it to map out the thermal phase diagram, determining the \n$T_{c}$ and $T_{AF}$ scales, presented here, \nand also the evolution of the spectral\nfeatures across the ordering transitions.  Results on this will be \npresented separately.  The approach here generalizes naturally \nto the problem of $d$-wave superconductivity\ncoexisting with magnetic order, as in some\nheavy fermions and ferropnictides. We are\nexploring these.\n\nWe acknowledge use of the High Performance Computing facility at HRI\nand thank Nyayabanta Swain and Sauri Bhattacharyya for comments.\n\n\\section{Appendix: approximate dispersion in the gapless phase}\n\nAt small $\\Delta_0/J$, in the gapless phase, we can write explicit\ndispersions for the six bands that emerge from the Green's function\nscheme. This involves solving for the three poles of the Green's\nfunction, for each spin projection, at $\\Delta_0 =0$, and then\ncalculating the small $\\Delta_0$ corrections. In this spirit,\nthe three poles of the up spin Green's function at $\\Delta_0=0$\nare:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E_{1}^{0}({\\bf k}) & = & E^{+}({\\bf k}) \\\\ \\nonumber \n E_{2}^{0}({\\bf k}) & = & E^{-}({\\bf k}) \\\\ \\nonumber\n E_{3}^{0}({\\bf k}) & = & -\\epsilon({\\bf k})\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n E^{\\pm}({\\bf k}) & = & { {(\\epsilon_{\\bf k}+\\epsilon_{\\bf k + Q}) \\pm \n \\sqrt{(\\epsilon_{\\bf k} - \\epsilon_{\\bf k + Q})^{2} + 4 J^2S^2}} \n\\over 2} \\nonumber\n \\\\ \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe pole at $E^0_3({\\bf k}) = -\\epsilon({\\bf k})$ has residue zero\n(since it is artificial and cancels with a zero of the Green's function).\nAt $\\Delta_0 \\neq 0$, however, all the poles have non zero residues,\nand the shifted poles are defined by $E_{\\alpha}({\\bf k})\n= E^0_{\\alpha}({\\bf k}) + \\eta_{\\alpha}({\\bf k})$, where:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\eta_{1}({\\bf k}) & = & \\frac{\\Delta_{0}^{2}(E^{+}(\\bf k) - \\epsilon({\\bf k+Q}))}\n {[(E^{+}({\\bf k}) - E^{-}({\\bf k}))(E^{+}({\\bf k}) + \\epsilon({\\bf k}))-\\Delta_{0}^{2}]} \\nonumber \n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\eta_{2}({\\bf k}) & = & \\frac{\\Delta_{0}^{2}(E^{-}({\\bf k})-\\epsilon({\\bf k+Q}))}\n {[(E^{-}({\\bf k}) - E^{+}({\\bf k}))(E^{-}({\\bf k}) + \\epsilon({\\bf k}))-\\Delta_{0}^{2}]} \\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n \\eta_{3}({\\bf k}) & = & \\frac{-\\Delta_{0}^{2}(\\epsilon({\\bf k}) + \\epsilon({\\bf k+Q}))}\n {[(\\epsilon({\\bf k}) + E^{-}({\\bf k}))(\\epsilon({\\bf k}) + E^{+}({\\bf k}))-\\Delta_{0}^{2}]}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe above corrections correspond to the poles of $G_{\\uparrow \\uparrow}({\\bf k}, i\\omega_{n})$.\nSimilarly, corrections corresponding to the poles of $G_{\\downarrow \\downarrow}({\\bf k}, i\\omega_{n})$\ncan also be determined. Together with Eqn.(5) they give corrections to the six poles \nfor the total $G({\\bf k}, i\\omega_{n})$.\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{ginzburg}\nV. L. Ginzburg, Sov. Phys.
