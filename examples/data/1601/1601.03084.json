An {\\em equivariant compactification} of $X$ is a compact space $K$, equipped with a continuous action by $G$, together with a continuous equivariant map $i\\colon X\\to K$ having a dense image in $K$. The question of interest is whether, given $G$ and $X$, there exists a compactification into which $X$ embeds topologically, that is, $i$ is a homeomorphism onto its image.\n\nFor instance, this is so if a topological group $G$ acts on itself by left translations, in which case the compactification is the greatest ambit of $G$ (\\cite{brook}; \\cite{P06}, p. 42). If the acting group $G$ is discrete, then its action on $\\beta X$, the Stone-\\v Cech compactification of $X$, is clearly continuous, so $i$ is the canonical homeomorphic embedding  $X\\hookrightarrow\\beta X$. For non-discrete $G$, the action on the Stone-\\v Cech compactification $\\beta X$ is continuous just in some exceptional cases. Nevertheless, if the acting group $G$ is locally compact, then every $G$-space $X$ admits an equivariant compactification into which $X$ embeds homeomorphically, this is an important result by de Vries \\cite{dV-1,dV}. (For compact Lie groups, the result was known to Palais much earlier, \\cite{palais}.)\n\nFor a long time it was unknown whether the same conclusion holds in the case of every acting topological group (the question was advertised by de Vries in 1975, see \\cite{dV-2}). However, Megrelishvili \\cite{megrelishvili,megrelishvili89} has shown it is not so, by constructing an example where both $G$ and $X$ are Polish, yet the embedding $i$ is never topological for any equivariant compactification of $X$.\nMore examples can be found in the work of Megrelishvili and Scarr \\cite{MegS} and Sokolovskaya \\cite{sokolovskaya}. (The earliest claim of an example \\cite{AS} was withdrawn by its authors.) In some examples of Megrelishvili, the mapping $i$ is not even injecive.\n\nSome time in the 1980s, Yuri M. Smirnov asked about the existence of a topological group $G$ acting on a (non-trivial) space $X$ in such a way that the only equivariant compactification of $X$ is the singleton. The question was apparently never mentioned in Smirnov's papers; however, it was well known among the Moscow general and geometric topologists, and later documented in Megrelishvili's papers \\cite{megrelishvili89,megrelishvili07}. (See also a discussion in \\cite{P06}, Rem. 3.1.6.)\nHere we notice that a topological transformation group conjectured by Smirnov indeed exists. \n\nThe construction is based on the example of Megrelishvili \\cite{megrelishvili,megrelishvili89}, the first ever in which the mapping $i\\colon X\\to K$ is not a topological embedding. In this construction, the space $X$ is the metric fan, joining the base point $\\ast$ with countably many endpoints $x_n$ with the help of intervals of unit length, and equipped with the graph metric. The group $G$ is a certain subgroup of the group of homeomorphisms of $X$ with the compact-open topology, chosen in a certain subtle way.  Megrelishvili has shown that in every equivariant compactification of $X$, the images of the points $x_n$ converge to the image of the base point $\\ast$, so the compactification mapping $i$ is not homeomorphic. A further observation by Megrelishvili is that if one joins two copies of such a fan by identifying their respective endpoints and extends the group action over the resulting space, then the image of the sequence of $(x_n)$ will converge at the same time to either of the two base points, and consequently $i$ is not even injective. \n\nThe idea of our example is, starting with a topological transformation group, to attach to it a copy of the double Megrelishvili fan (in its rational version) at every pair of distinct points $x,y$. As a result, in any equivariant compactification of the resulting space, $X$ collapses to a point. If we repeat the same construction countably many times, the union of the increasing chain of resulting spaces has no nontrivial compactifications. \nThe topological space that we obtain is countably infinite, metrizable, and has no isolated points, and so is homeomorphic to the space of rational numbers.\n\n\n\nThe article is concluded with a discussion of some open questions.\n\n\n\\section{Universal equivariant compactifications}\n\nIn this and the next section we will discuss known results, with a view to make the presentation self-sufficient.\n\nAll our actions will be on the left. \nIf a topological group $G$ acts continuously on a compact space $K$, then the associated representation of $G$ by linear isometries on the space $C(K)$, \n", "index": 1, "text": "\n\\[{^gf}(x) = f(g^{-1}x),~~g\\in G,~x\\in K,~f\\in C(K),\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{{}^{g}f}(x)=f(g^{-1}x),~{}~{}g\\in G,~{}x\\in K,~{}f\\in C(K),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mmultiscripts><mi>f</mi><mprescripts/><none/><mi>g</mi></mmultiscripts><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msup><mi>g</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"9.1pt\">,</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\">,</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>K</mi></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\">,</mo><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>K</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03084.tex", "nexttext": "\nis continuous as a mapping from $G$ to the Banach space (moreover, a $C^\\ast$-algebra) ${\\mbox{\\rm CB}\\,}(X)$ of all continuous bounded complex functions on $X$ with the supremum norm. \n\nThis allows one to retrieve the {\\em maximal} (or: {\\em universal}) equivariant compactification of $X$, as follows.

(Cf. e.g. \\cite{GTW,Gl-W3}; we will allude to this parallel again in the Conclusion.)\n\nFor a more detailed treatment with numerous related results, references, and open problems, see Megrelishvili's survey paper \\cite{megrelishvili07}.\n\n\\section{Equivariant metric fan}\n\nHere we revise Megrelishvili's important construction from \\cite{megrelishvili,megrelishvili89}.\n\n\\subsection{}\nDenote $M$ the usual metric fan, that is, the union of countably many copies of the unit interval, $[0,1]\\times{\\mathbb N}$, with the base $\\{0\\}\\times{\\mathbb N}$ glued to a single point, $\\ast$, and the topology given by the graph metric. In particular, $M$ is homeomorphic to the union of straight line intervals $[0,e_n]$ in the Hilbert space $\\ell^2$ joining zero with the basic vectors $e_n$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, with the norm topology. This is the cone over the discrete space ${\\mathbb N}$ of the positive integers, except that the topology is weaker than that in the cone construction as used in algebraic topology.\n\nThe main invention of Megrelishvili is the clever choice of an acting group, $G$. It consists of all homeomorphisms of the fan keeping fixed each point located at a distance $1/k$, $k=1,2,3,\\ldots$ from the base point $\\ast$. (We will refer to such points in the future as {\\em marked points.}) Thus, each element of $G$, when restricted to an interval of the form $[1/(k+1),1/k]\\times\\{n\\}$, $k,n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, is an orientation-preserving self-homeomorhism of the interval. This means that $G$, as a group, is the product of a countably infinite family of copies of the group of homeomorphisms of the interval. Equip the group of homeomorphisms of every interval with the usual compact-open topology (that is, the topology of uniform convergence on the interval), and $G$, with the corresponding product topology. Now one can easily verify that this topology is the compact-open topology, or the topology of compact convergence on the fan.\n\nThe action of $G$ on $M$ is continuous. \nAt every point $x\\in M\\setminus\\{\\ast\\}$ (including the marked points) this is so because $x$ has a $G$-invariant closed neighbourhood homeomorphic to the unit interval, and locally the action of $G$ is just the action of some group of homeomorphisms with the compact-open topology which is continuous. \nAt the base point $\\ast$, the action is continuous namely due to all those fixed points converging to it in all directions. If ${\\varepsilon}>0$, one can select $k$ with $1/k<{\\varepsilon}$, then the union $[0,1/k]\\times{\\mathbb N}$ is a $G$-invariant neighbourhood of $\\ast$, contained in the ${\\varepsilon}$-ball around $\\ast$.\n\nNow let $f$ be a real-valued $\\pi$-uniform function on $M$. One can assume that $f$ takes values in the interval $[0,1]$. Fix an ${\\varepsilon}>0$. Since $f$ is continuous at the base point, there is $k$ with ${\\lvert{f(x)-f(\\ast)}\\rvert}<{\\varepsilon}/2$ whenever $d(\\ast,x)\\leq 1/k$, that is, if $x$ belongs to one of the intervals $[0,1/k]\\times\\{n\\}$. \n\nFor each one of the fixed points $(1/k,n),(1/(k-1),n),\\ldots,(1,n)$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}$, because of the continuity of $f$, there is ${\\varepsilon}_{i,n}>0$ such that the difference of value of $f$ at the points $\\left(\\frac 1i\\pm {\\varepsilon}_{i,n},n\\right)$ is less than ${\\varepsilon}/2k$. We can assume ${\\varepsilon}_{i,n}$ to be so small that the open interval of radius ${\\varepsilon}_{i,n}$ around $(1/k,n)$ contains no other marked points.\nSince $f$ is $\\pi$-uniform, for some neighbourhood $V$ of the identity in $G$ one has ${\\lvert{f(x)-f(vx)}\\rvert}<{\\varepsilon}/2k$ for each $x\\in M$ and $v\\in V$. In view of the definition of the topology of $G$, for all $n$ sufficiently large, $n\\geq N$, the restriction of $V$ to every interval between two consequent fixed points along $[0,1]\\times \\{n\\}$ contains all homeomorphisms of this interval. In particular, suitable elements of $V$ take \n$\\left(\\frac 1k+{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$ to $\\left(\\frac 1{k-1}-{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$, $\\left(\\frac 1{k-1}+{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$ to $\\left(\\frac 1{k-2}-{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$, and so on. The triangle inequality implies that ${\\lvert{f(1,n)-f(\\ast)}\\rvert}<{\\varepsilon}$ for all $n\\geq N$. \n\nBy the definition of the topology of the universal compactification $\\alpha_G(M)$, the images $i(1,n)$, $n\\to\\infty$ converge to $i(\\ast)$. The continuous equivariant mapping $i$ is no not a homeomorphic embedding. \n\n\\subsection{} The above construction was further modified by Megrelishvili as follows. Let $M(x)$ and $M(y)$ be two copies of the metric fan, having base points $x$ and $y$ respectively, where $x\\neq y$. The same group $G$ acts continuously on both spaces. Now glue $M(x)$ and $M(y)$ together along the respective endpoints $(1,n)$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}$, with the quotient topology (the same: the topology given by the graph metric). Thus, we obtain a ``metric suspension'' over ${\\mathbb N}$. Since the endpoints are all fixed, the action of $G$ on the resulting space is well-defined and continuous. In the universal $G$-compactification of the ``double fan'' $M(x,y)$, one has $i(1,n)\\to i(x)$ and $i(1,n)\\to i(y)$, and so $i(x)=i(y)$. The mapping $i$ is not even injective. \n\n\\subsection{} In this paper we find it more convenient to replace the acting group, $G$, with a product of two copies of the same topological group, $G_x\\times G_y$, where $G_x$ acts on $M(x)$ and $G_y$ acts on $M(y)$. \nThe action by each of the respective groups, $G_x$ and $G_y$, extend over the disjoint union $M(x)\\sqcup M(y)$  by acting on the ``complementary part'' in a trivial way, that is, leaving each point fixed. This way, we obtain a continuous action of the product group $G_x\\times G_y$. After we glue $M(x)$ and $M(y)$ together along the endpoints $(1,n)$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}$, the action of the product group $G_x\\times G_y$ on $M(x,y)$ is still well-defined and it is easy to see that it is continuous. Again, in the universal $G_x\\times G_y$ equivariant compactification of $M(x,y)$, the images of the points $x$ and $y$ are identical.\n\n\\subsection{} Megrelishvili's double metric fan, or metric suspension, will be the key element in the construction below. However, we need to introduce slight modifications. \n\nFirst of all, notice that the topology on the group $G$ can be strengthened to the topology of pointwise convergence on $M$ viewed as discrete. In other words, the basic system of neighbourhoods of identity is formed by finite intersections of stabilizers ${\\mbox{\\rm St}}_{x_1}\\cap\\ldots\\cap {\\mbox{\\rm St}}_{x_n}$, for all finite collections $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\in M$. This is a group topology.\nOn the group of homeomorphisms of the interval, this topology is easily seen to be finer than the compact-open topology: indeed, given ${\\varepsilon}>0$, find $k>{\\varepsilon}^{-1}$, and if a homeomorphism stabilizers every point $1/k, 2/k,\\ldots, (k-1)/k$, then it moves any point of the interval by less than ${\\varepsilon}$. And on the group $G$, the pointwise topology is that of the product of groups of homeomorphisms of the individual intervals between marked points, if each one of them is equipped with the pointwise topology. Consequently, our topology is strictly finer than the topology used by Megrelishvili, and so the action is still continuous. This fact is easily seen directly as well: for points $x$ other than the base point, one can have $x$ ``boxed in'' on both sides by means of two points $y,z$ stabilized by an open neighbourhood, $V\\ni e$, and as a result, every element of $V$ will take the interval $(y,z)$ to itself. At the base point, the continuity of the action is, as before, a consequence of the existence of the uniformly convergent sequences of fixed points in all directions. \n\nWhen this topology is used, the interval $[0,1]$ can be replaced just with a linearly ordered set, $(X,\\leq)$. The only restrictions are: $X$ contains the smallest element to which there converges a strictly decreasing countable sequence, and the order-preserving bijections stabilizing elements of this sequence (of marked points) act transitively on each interval between two consecutive marked points. \nIn this paper, we will make the most economical selection, namely, the interval $[0,1]_{{\\mathbb Q}}$ of the rational numbers. Also, technically it would be more convenient for us to fix as the convergent sequence $(2^{-k})_{k=0}^{\\infty}$ rather than $(1/k)_{k=1}^{\\infty}$.\n\n\\subsection{}\nTo sum up, we will denote $M(x,y)$ the {\\em rational Megrelishvili double fan}. As a set, it is obtained from $[0,1]_{\\mathbb Q}\\times {\\mathbb N}\\times \\{x,y\\}\\times \\{(x,y)\\}$ by identifying \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\n        all the points $(0,n,x,(x,y))$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, with the point $x$, \n\\item all the points $(0,n,y,(x,y))$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$,  with the point $y$, and \n\\item every point $(1,n,x,(x,y))$ with the point $(1,n,y,(x,y))$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$. \n        \\end{itemize}\n        \n Notice that the order of $x$ and $y$ matters, which is why we have included the indexing pair $(x,y)$ in the definition. However, if it is clear what pair we are talking about, we will still simply talk of the points $(t,n,x)$ and $(t,n,y)$, suppressing the index $(x,y)$.\n        \nThe topology on the space $M(x,y)$ is given by the graph distance, that is, the length of the shortest path joining two points. A path between two points $a,b$ is a sequence of points $x_0=a, x_1,\\ldots,x_n=b$, where any two adjacent points belong to the same edge. Thus, $M(x,y)$ is a countable metric space.\n        \nA topological realization of $M(x,y)$ can be obtained inside the space $\\ell^2({\\mathbb N})$ by identifying $x$ with $e_0$, $y$ with $-e_0$, and by joining $e_0$ and $-e_0$ with each vector $e_n$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, by means of a straight line segment in the space $\\ell^2$ viewed as a vector space {\\em over the rationals,} ${\\mathbb Q}$. Then induce the norm topology from $\\ell^2$.\n\nThe group $G=G_{(x,y)}$ of transformations of $M(x,y)$ consists of all homeomorphisms which keep each point of the form\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6789, "prevtext": "\nis continuous as a mapping from $G$ to the Banach space (moreover, a $C^\\ast$-algebra) ${\\mbox{\\rm CB}\\,}(X)$ of all continuous bounded complex functions on $X$ with the supremum norm. \n\nThis allows one to retrieve the {\\em maximal} (or: {\\em universal}) equivariant compactification of $X$, as follows.

This ${\\mbox{\\rm UCB}\\,}_G(X)$ is a $C^\\ast$-subalgebra of ${\\mbox{\\rm CB}\\,}(X)$, and so $G$ acts continuously on the corresponding maximal ideal space,  $\\alpha_G(X)$.

(Cf. e.g. \\cite{GTW,Gl-W3}; we will allude to this parallel again in the Conclusion.)\n\nFor a more detailed treatment with numerous related results, references, and open problems, see Megrelishvili's survey paper \\cite{megrelishvili07}.\n\n\\section{Equivariant metric fan}\n\nHere we revise Megrelishvili's important construction from \\cite{megrelishvili,megrelishvili89}.\n\n\\subsection{}\nDenote $M$ the usual metric fan, that is, the union of countably many copies of the unit interval, $[0,1]\\times{\\mathbb N}$, with the base $\\{0\\}\\times{\\mathbb N}$ glued to a single point, $\\ast$, and the topology given by the graph metric. In particular, $M$ is homeomorphic to the union of straight line intervals $[0,e_n]$ in the Hilbert space $\\ell^2$ joining zero with the basic vectors $e_n$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, with the norm topology. This is the cone over the discrete space ${\\mathbb N}$ of the positive integers, except that the topology is weaker than that in the cone construction as used in algebraic topology.\n\nThe main invention of Megrelishvili is the clever choice of an acting group, $G$. It consists of all homeomorphisms of the fan keeping fixed each point located at a distance $1/k$, $k=1,2,3,\\ldots$ from the base point $\\ast$. (We will refer to such points in the future as {\\em marked points.}) Thus, each element of $G$, when restricted to an interval of the form $[1/(k+1),1/k]\\times\\{n\\}$, $k,n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, is an orientation-preserving self-homeomorhism of the interval. This means that $G$, as a group, is the product of a countably infinite family of copies of the group of homeomorphisms of the interval. Equip the group of homeomorphisms of every interval with the usual compact-open topology (that is, the topology of uniform convergence on the interval), and $G$, with the corresponding product topology. Now one can easily verify that this topology is the compact-open topology, or the topology of compact convergence on the fan.\n\nThe action of $G$ on $M$ is continuous. \nAt every point $x\\in M\\setminus\\{\\ast\\}$ (including the marked points) this is so because $x$ has a $G$-invariant closed neighbourhood homeomorphic to the unit interval, and locally the action of $G$ is just the action of some group of homeomorphisms with the compact-open topology which is continuous. \nAt the base point $\\ast$, the action is continuous namely due to all those fixed points converging to it in all directions. If ${\\varepsilon}>0$, one can select $k$ with $1/k<{\\varepsilon}$, then the union $[0,1/k]\\times{\\mathbb N}$ is a $G$-invariant neighbourhood of $\\ast$, contained in the ${\\varepsilon}$-ball around $\\ast$.\n\nNow let $f$ be a real-valued $\\pi$-uniform function on $M$. One can assume that $f$ takes values in the interval $[0,1]$. Fix an ${\\varepsilon}>0$. Since $f$ is continuous at the base point, there is $k$ with ${\\lvert{f(x)-f(\\ast)}\\rvert}<{\\varepsilon}/2$ whenever $d(\\ast,x)\\leq 1/k$, that is, if $x$ belongs to one of the intervals $[0,1/k]\\times\\{n\\}$. \n\nFor each one of the fixed points $(1/k,n),(1/(k-1),n),\\ldots,(1,n)$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}$, because of the continuity of $f$, there is ${\\varepsilon}_{i,n}>0$ such that the difference of value of $f$ at the points $\\left(\\frac 1i\\pm {\\varepsilon}_{i,n},n\\right)$ is less than ${\\varepsilon}/2k$. We can assume ${\\varepsilon}_{i,n}$ to be so small that the open interval of radius ${\\varepsilon}_{i,n}$ around $(1/k,n)$ contains no other marked points.\nSince $f$ is $\\pi$-uniform, for some neighbourhood $V$ of the identity in $G$ one has ${\\lvert{f(x)-f(vx)}\\rvert}<{\\varepsilon}/2k$ for each $x\\in M$ and $v\\in V$. In view of the definition of the topology of $G$, for all $n$ sufficiently large, $n\\geq N$, the restriction of $V$ to every interval between two consequent fixed points along $[0,1]\\times \\{n\\}$ contains all homeomorphisms of this interval. In particular, suitable elements of $V$ take \n$\\left(\\frac 1k+{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$ to $\\left(\\frac 1{k-1}-{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$, $\\left(\\frac 1{k-1}+{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$ to $\\left(\\frac 1{k-2}-{\\varepsilon}_{k,n},n\\right)$, and so on. The triangle inequality implies that ${\\lvert{f(1,n)-f(\\ast)}\\rvert}<{\\varepsilon}$ for all $n\\geq N$. \n\nBy the definition of the topology of the universal compactification $\\alpha_G(M)$, the images $i(1,n)$, $n\\to\\infty$ converge to $i(\\ast)$. The continuous equivariant mapping $i$ is no not a homeomorphic embedding. \n\n\\subsection{} The above construction was further modified by Megrelishvili as follows. Let $M(x)$ and $M(y)$ be two copies of the metric fan, having base points $x$ and $y$ respectively, where $x\\neq y$. The same group $G$ acts continuously on both spaces. Now glue $M(x)$ and $M(y)$ together along the respective endpoints $(1,n)$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}$, with the quotient topology (the same: the topology given by the graph metric). Thus, we obtain a ``metric suspension'' over ${\\mathbb N}$. Since the endpoints are all fixed, the action of $G$ on the resulting space is well-defined and continuous. In the universal $G$-compactification of the ``double fan'' $M(x,y)$, one has $i(1,n)\\to i(x)$ and $i(1,n)\\to i(y)$, and so $i(x)=i(y)$. The mapping $i$ is not even injective. \n\n\\subsection{} In this paper we find it more convenient to replace the acting group, $G$, with a product of two copies of the same topological group, $G_x\\times G_y$, where $G_x$ acts on $M(x)$ and $G_y$ acts on $M(y)$. \nThe action by each of the respective groups, $G_x$ and $G_y$, extend over the disjoint union $M(x)\\sqcup M(y)$  by acting on the ``complementary part'' in a trivial way, that is, leaving each point fixed. This way, we obtain a continuous action of the product group $G_x\\times G_y$. After we glue $M(x)$ and $M(y)$ together along the endpoints $(1,n)$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}$, the action of the product group $G_x\\times G_y$ on $M(x,y)$ is still well-defined and it is easy to see that it is continuous. Again, in the universal $G_x\\times G_y$ equivariant compactification of $M(x,y)$, the images of the points $x$ and $y$ are identical.\n\n\\subsection{} Megrelishvili's double metric fan, or metric suspension, will be the key element in the construction below. However, we need to introduce slight modifications. \n\nFirst of all, notice that the topology on the group $G$ can be strengthened to the topology of pointwise convergence on $M$ viewed as discrete. In other words, the basic system of neighbourhoods of identity is formed by finite intersections of stabilizers ${\\mbox{\\rm St}}_{x_1}\\cap\\ldots\\cap {\\mbox{\\rm St}}_{x_n}$, for all finite collections $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\in M$. This is a group topology.\nOn the group of homeomorphisms of the interval, this topology is easily seen to be finer than the compact-open topology: indeed, given ${\\varepsilon}>0$, find $k>{\\varepsilon}^{-1}$, and if a homeomorphism stabilizers every point $1/k, 2/k,\\ldots, (k-1)/k$, then it moves any point of the interval by less than ${\\varepsilon}$. And on the group $G$, the pointwise topology is that of the product of groups of homeomorphisms of the individual intervals between marked points, if each one of them is equipped with the pointwise topology. Consequently, our topology is strictly finer than the topology used by Megrelishvili, and so the action is still continuous. This fact is easily seen directly as well: for points $x$ other than the base point, one can have $x$ ``boxed in'' on both sides by means of two points $y,z$ stabilized by an open neighbourhood, $V\\ni e$, and as a result, every element of $V$ will take the interval $(y,z)$ to itself. At the base point, the continuity of the action is, as before, a consequence of the existence of the uniformly convergent sequences of fixed points in all directions. \n\nWhen this topology is used, the interval $[0,1]$ can be replaced just with a linearly ordered set, $(X,\\leq)$. The only restrictions are: $X$ contains the smallest element to which there converges a strictly decreasing countable sequence, and the order-preserving bijections stabilizing elements of this sequence (of marked points) act transitively on each interval between two consecutive marked points. \nIn this paper, we will make the most economical selection, namely, the interval $[0,1]_{{\\mathbb Q}}$ of the rational numbers. Also, technically it would be more convenient for us to fix as the convergent sequence $(2^{-k})_{k=0}^{\\infty}$ rather than $(1/k)_{k=1}^{\\infty}$.\n\n\\subsection{}\nTo sum up, we will denote $M(x,y)$ the {\\em rational Megrelishvili double fan}. As a set, it is obtained from $[0,1]_{\\mathbb Q}\\times {\\mathbb N}\\times \\{x,y\\}\\times \\{(x,y)\\}$ by identifying \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\n        all the points $(0,n,x,(x,y))$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, with the point $x$, \n\\item all the points $(0,n,y,(x,y))$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$,  with the point $y$, and \n\\item every point $(1,n,x,(x,y))$ with the point $(1,n,y,(x,y))$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$. \n        \\end{itemize}\n        \n Notice that the order of $x$ and $y$ matters, which is why we have included the indexing pair $(x,y)$ in the definition. However, if it is clear what pair we are talking about, we will still simply talk of the points $(t,n,x)$ and $(t,n,y)$, suppressing the index $(x,y)$.\n        \nThe topology on the space $M(x,y)$ is given by the graph distance, that is, the length of the shortest path joining two points. A path between two points $a,b$ is a sequence of points $x_0=a, x_1,\\ldots,x_n=b$, where any two adjacent points belong to the same edge. Thus, $M(x,y)$ is a countable metric space.\n        \nA topological realization of $M(x,y)$ can be obtained inside the space $\\ell^2({\\mathbb N})$ by identifying $x$ with $e_0$, $y$ with $-e_0$, and by joining $e_0$ and $-e_0$ with each vector $e_n$, $n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+$, by means of a straight line segment in the space $\\ell^2$ viewed as a vector space {\\em over the rationals,} ${\\mathbb Q}$. Then induce the norm topology from $\\ell^2$.\n\nThe group $G=G_{(x,y)}$ of transformations of $M(x,y)$ consists of all homeomorphisms which keep each point of the form\n", "index": 7, "text": "\n\\[\\left(2^{-k},n,x\\right), ~\\left(2^{-k},n,y\\right),~k\\in{\\mathbb N},~n\\in{\\mathbb N}_+,\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\left(2^{-k},n,x\\right),~{}\\left(2^{-k},n,y\\right),~{}k\\in{\\mathbb{N}},~{}n\\in%&#10;{\\mathbb{N}}_{+},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></msup><mo>,</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\">,</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></msup><mo>,</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\">,</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>\u2115</mi></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\">,</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><msub><mi>\u2115</mi><mo>+</mo></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03084.tex", "nexttext": " \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\nfixed.

Indeed, one can easily see that $G$ is the product of countably many copies of the well-known Polish group ${\\mbox{\\rm Aut}\\,}({\\mathbb Q},\\leq)$ of all order-preserving bijections of the rationals, with its standard topology of simple convergence on ${\\mathbb Q}$ as discrete.\nThe group $G$ acts continuously on $M(x,y)$, and for every equivariant compactification of this space, one has $i(x)=i(y)$, with the same exact argument as in the original Megrelishvili's example.\n\n\\subsection{}\nThe rational version of Megrelishvili's metric fan is not new. It was first described by J. van Mill (\\cite{vM}, Remark 3.4), see also \\cite{kozlov}, example 4 in \\S 5.\n\n\\section{Attaching a double fan to every pair of points of a $G$-space}\n\nGiven a topological $G$-space $X$, the space that we will denote $M(X)$ is obtained from $X$ by attaching to every ordered pair of distinct points $x,y\\in X$ a double rational fan $M(x,y)$, and subsequently enlarging the transformation group so as to bring in all the copies of $G_{(x,y)}$ acting on each $M(x,y)$.\nNotice that we attach two different fans to each pair $\\{x,y\\}$, one corresponding to the ordered pair $(x,y)$, and the other, to the pair $(y,x)$, this will be necessary later on for the symmetry reasons.\nUnder some restrictions on $(X,G)$, the resulting action is continuous.\nAs a consequence, within every equivariant compactification of the resulting space $M(X)$, the original space $X$ will collapse to a point. Here is a more precise description.\n\n\\subsection{}\nLet $X$ be a (Tychonoff) topological space. As usual, $X^2\\setminus\\Delta$ denotes the collection of all ordered pairs of different points of $X$.  \n\nConsider the disjoint sum $\\sqcup_{(x,y)\\in X^2\\setminus\\Delta} M(x,y) $ of copies of the double rational fan, and glue this sum to $X$ along the canonical map sending each fan endpoint to the corresponding point of $X$. Denote the resulting set $M(X)$.\n\nThe first task is to topologize $M(X)$. Let $d$ is a pseudometric on $X$. Denote $\\bar d$ the corresponding path pseudometric on $M(X)$, that is, $\\bar d(a,b)$ is the smallest among the numbers $\\sum_{i=0}^n d(x_i,x_{i+1})$, where $x_0=a$, $x_n=b$, and the distance between every two consecutive points $x_i,x_{i+1}$ is calculated either to $X$, or in some $M(x,y)$. \n\nIn general, the path length can be arbitrarily long, but\nif $d\\leq 2$ (which is not a restrictive condition from the view of topology that $d$ generates), then $n\\leq 3$ suffices.

For any $x,y\\in M^{\\infty}(X)$, there is $n$ with $x,y\\in M^{(n)}(X)$. Therefore, $x$ and $y$ are joined by an equivariant Megrelishvili double fan $M(x,y)$ inside $M^{(n+1)}(X)$. The topological group $G_{x,y}$ is a topological subgroup of $\\tilde G^{(n+1)}$, therefore of $\\tilde G^{(\\infty)}$, with the standard action on $M(x,y)$. Under the mapping $i$, one has $i(x)=i(y)$. We conclude: the entire universal compactification of $M^{\\infty}(X)$ is a singleton.\n\n\\subsection{}\nFinally, notice that, according to a well-known result of Sierpinski from 1920, a countable metrizable space without isolated points is homeomorphic to the space of rational numbers, ${\\mathbb Q}$, with the usual topology. Thus, topologically, $M^{\\infty}(X)$ is just ${\\mathbb Q}$.\n\n\n\\section{Concluding remarks}\n\n\\subsection{}\nBoth $X$ and $G$ in this example are separable metrizable.\nThe author does not know if the example can be modified so as to have both $X$ and $G$ Polish (separable completely metrizable). \n\n\\subsection{}\nThe example constructed here is of course artificial. However, if the story of extreme amenability is any indication (see e.g. \\cite{P06}), the phenomenon may one day be naturally found. \n\nThere is an even closer parallel between the present example and the phenomenon discovered and explored by Glasner, Tsirelson and Weiss \\cite{GTW} and Glasner and Weiss \\cite{Gl-W3} whereby a weakly continuous action of a Polish group on a standard probability measure space cannot be realized spatially, that is, as a set-theoretic action on a compact space equipped with an invariant measure. Here, the phenomenon occurs very naturally: every L\\'evy group \\cite{GrM} of measure-preserving transformations behaves in such a way. \n\nThis reinforces a feeling that there might exist numerous {\\em natural} examples of topological transformation groups whose universal equivariant compactification is a singleton.\n\n\\subsection{}\nFor instance, can such an example be realized as the group of automorphisms of a suitable (discrete or continuous) ultrahomogeneous Fra\\\"\\i ss\\'e structure? \n\nThe {\\em Gromov compactification} of a bounded metric space $X$ corresponds to the $C^\\ast$-algebra generated by all distance functions $x\\mapsto d(x,-)$; under the action of the isometry group  with the pointwise topology, such functions are always $\\pi$-uniform, and so the Gromov compactification is equivariant, and it is a homeomorphic embedding (see e.g. \\cite{megrelishvili07}, sect. 2). This means that the topology on the conjectural Fra\\'\\i ss\\'e structure needs to be modified, but again, in some ``natural'' way (given by a suitable partial order for instance, as it is esentially the case in our example).\n\n\\subsection{} An elegant ``natural'' example where the universal equivariant compactification has been calculated explicitely is that of the unit sphere ${\\mathbb S}^{\\infty}$ in the Hilbert space $\\ell^2$ under the action of the unitary group $U(\\ell^2)$ with the strong operator topology. This compactification is the unit ball ${\\mathbb{B}}^{\\infty}$ with the weak topology. This is a result by Stojanov \\cite{stoyanov}.\n\nThis motivated Megrelishvili to ask whether the same conclusion holds for the unit sphere in every separable reflexive Banach space $E$ under the action of the  group of isometries of $E$ with the strong operator topology, see Question 2.5 (2005) in \\cite{megrelishvili07}. However, it appears to us the question needs to be adjusted.\n\nAccording to Jarosz \\cite{jarosz}, every Banach space can be renormed in such a way that the group of isometries consists of constant multiples of the identity. For such a renormed space, the Stone-\\v Cech compactification of the projective space is an equivariant compactification of the sphere, because the action of the group of isometries is trivial. Since for $E$ infinite dimensional the Stone-\\v Cech compactification is non-metrizable, the answer to the question as stated is in the negative. \n\nHowever, it makes sense to reformulate the question for separable reflexive Banach spaces whose group of isometries has a dense orbit in the unit sphere. For instance, it appears the answer is already unknown for $L^p(0,1)$, $1<p<\\infty$, $p\\neq 2$. \n\n\\subsection{} Even for non-reflexive spaces the question makes sense. \nIn particular, the group of isometries of the Gurarij space has attacted plenty of interest recently \\cite{BY}. Is it true that the universal equivariant compactification of the unit sphere in the Gurarij space under the action of the group of isometries with the pointwise topology is the Gromov compactification of the sphere? \n\nThe same question, for the Holmes space \\cite{holmes} (see also \\cite{P06}, pp. 112--113).\n\nNotice in this connection that the closed ball of $\\ell^2$ in the weak topology is the Gromov compactification of the unit sphere.\n\n\\subsection{}\nThe analogous question, for the Urysohn sphere ${\\mathbb S}_{\\mathbb U}$ \\cite{NVTS}. More precisely: is the universal equivariant compactification of the Urysohn sphere under the action of the group of isometries with the pointwise topology equal to the Gromov compactification of ${\\mathbb S}_{\\mathbb U}$? Probably the answer is in the positive and should not be very difficult to obtain, as the group of isometries of the Urysohn sphere is by now pretty well understood. \n\n\\subsection{} In conclusion, here is a question suggested by Furstenberg and Scarr (see \\cite{megrelishvili07}, question 2.6 (2006)): does there exist a topological transformation group $(G,X)$ whose universal equivariant compactification is a singleton, yet the action of $G$ on $X$ is transitive? \n\nSuch an example cannot be Polish because of Effros' Microtransivitity Theorem combined with the observation that for a closed subgroup $H$ of a topological group $G$, the equivariant compactification $\\alpha_G(G/H)$ is always a homeomorphic embedding of $G/H$ \\cite{dV-2}.\n\nAs noted by Jan van Mill (\\cite{vM}, question 3.5) the Furstenberg--Scarr question remains open already for groups acting on the space of rational numbers, ${\\mathbb Q}$. Of course in our example the action on ${\\mathbb Q}$ is highly non-transitive in view of all those marked points. \n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\n       \nI am very indebted to Michael Megrelishvili from whom over the years I have learned many things, including Smirnov's question.
