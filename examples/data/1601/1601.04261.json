Thermal fluctuations for such systems become very large and exhibit interesting  properties that are universal over different systems. The underlying principle for the universal properties is the fluctuation theorem (FT) which was first discovered for a deterministic system thermostatted so as to conserve the kinetic energy~\\cite{evans93,evans94,gallavotti}.  The FT was later proven to hold for a wide class of stochastic systems~\\cite{jarzynski,crooks,kurchan,lebowitz}. It deals with the thermal fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities produced persistently in time such as work and heat in nonequilibrium process. A typical form of the FT is given by $\\langle e^{-\\beta tw}\\rangle=1$ where $w$ is the rate of the work production piled over a period $t$ for a nonequilibrium dynamics driven by a nonconservative force acting on the system initially prepared in equilibrium with the heat bath. $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature $(k_B T)^{-1}$ for the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and the temperature $T$ of the heat bath. The bracket denotes the average over all possible fluctuations. In order to investigate the FT and related issues, it is required to accurately deal with the probability distribution of the thermal fluctuations found in measuring the work produced in the nonequilibrium process.\n\nWork and heat are path-dependent quantities. The thermal fluctuations of such quantities arise from many different paths (trajectories) along which the system evolves in time. One essentially needs the ensemble average over all paths from the past to the present, unlike the usual ensemble average of a state-dependent quantity over all states at a certain time. Theoretically the path integral theory was developed by Onsager and Mathlup based on the Langevin equation~\\cite{onsager} and used to study the FT~\\cite{kurchan}.    \n\nIn the experimental side, the fluctuations around the average value of a thermodynamic quantity for a small system become so predominant that they can be measurable with high accuracy by using modern technologies.  Interesting experiments confirming the FT were done for a colloidal particle in a moving optical trap~\\cite{wang,trepagnier}, a molecule in the AFM pulled by an external force~\\cite{hummer}, an electrical circuit driven by a small current~\\cite{garnier}, and a harmonic oscillator under an external force~\\cite{douarche,joubaud}, an RNA molecule unfolded and refolded by optical tweezers~\\cite{liphardt,collin}, a rotating motor protein $\\textrm{F}_1$-ATPase~\\cite{hayashi}, and a breathing harmonic potential~\\cite{pak}. \n\nAn alternative approach to investigate large fluctuations for a small system is the molecular dynamics (MD). The MD deal with both a small system and a heat bath consisting of extremely many molecules by taking into account the interactions in detail among them and mimics an experiment as realistically as possible. It can play the role to bridge an experiment and a phenomenological theory such as the Langevin dynamics. The MD study was once accompanied in an experimental study of a colloidal particle in a moving optical trap~\\cite{wang}. In our work, we investigate the motion of a colloidal particle in a liquid driven out of equilibrium by an external torque. We compare the results with those found by using the Langevin equation~\\cite{kwon-ao-thouless,kwon,noh}. We expect the MD technique used in our work to be useful for future studies of other types of nonequilibrium sources. \n\n\n\\section{Nonequilibrium Molecular dynamics}\n\nThe particles employed in the MD are divided into $N-1$ molecules of the liquid and the colloidal particle immersed in them. The liquid plays the role of a heat bath kept in equilibrium at a fixed temperature $T$.

Periodic boundary conditions are imposed. Since the LJ potential is long-ranged, it will cost an enormous running-time to sum all the interactions. Instead we set a cut-off distance $r_c$ above which the LJ potential are truncated.  We adopt the parameters from the well established MD studies on the LJ liquids~\\cite{thompson,cieplak}. The particle number density is set by $0.81\\sigma^{-3}$ and the temperature by $1.1\\epsilon/k_B$ for the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, which was found to represent a compressed liquid above the melting temperature. We use $r_c=2.2\\sigma$ for the interactions among the liquid molecules, $r_c=2.2\\sigma'$ for the interactions between the colloidal particle and a liquid molecule. Above $r_c$, the LJ potential was found to be negligible compared to thermal energies.\n\nWe introduce dimensionless variables and parameters used for the simulation. We rescale $M/m\\to M$, $\\mathbf{x}/\\sigma=\\mathbf{x}$, $\\beta^{-1}/\\epsilon\\to \\beta^{-1}$, $t/\\sqrt{m\\sigma^2/\\epsilon}\\to t$. Then $m$, $\\epsilon$, and $\\sigma$ are set to unity, and  $\\sigma'/\\sigma$ to $\\sigma'$. Given the above choice of temperature, $\\beta^{-1}$ goes to $1.1$. In this rescaling, $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j|/\\sigma;1)$ goes to $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j|; 1)$ and $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_i|/\\sigma; \\sigma'/\\sigma)$ to $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_i|; \\sigma')$.

In the following we will use the dimensionless variables and parameters.\n\n$\\gamma$ is not a real coefficient of the friction exerted in the liquid, but a mathematical parameter of the Langevin thermostat.

From the point of view based on the Langevin dynamics, the equation of motion of the colloidal particle corresponding to Eq.~(\\ref{colloidal}) is given as  $M\\dot{\\mathbf{v}}=\\mathbf{f}-\\gamma_c\\mathbf{v}+\\sqrt{\\gamma_c\\beta^{-1}}\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, where $\\gamma_c$ is the coefficient of the friction exerting on the colloidal particle in a viscous liquid and $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is the same Gaussian noise as in Eq.~(\\ref{reservoir}). In the overdamped limit, the fast-varying velocity relaxes more rapidly than the slowly-varying position. For $\\mathbf{f}=-k\\mathbf{x}$, the relaxation time of the velocity is known to be $M/\\gamma_c$, and that of the position to be $\\gamma_c/k$. Then the criterion for the overdamped limit can be given by $M/\\gamma _c\\ll\\gamma_c/k$. Mathematically, one can have the overdamped limit either by small $M$ or by large $\\gamma_c$. Since $M$ is very large for a real colloidal particle, compared to liquid molecules, $\\gamma_c$ should be large enough for the overdamped limit. However, $\\gamma_c$ is not a direct control parameter in the MD simulation. Instead, we can obtain the overdamped limit to a good extent by increasing the radius $\\sigma'$ of the cross section expecting $\\gamma_c\\propto \\sigma'$. In hydrodynamics, where the liquid is regarded as a continuous media, the Stokes law holds as $\\gamma_c=6\\pi\\eta R$ for the viscosity $\\eta$ and the radius of the colloidal particle $R$. In the MD simulation, $R$ should be replaced by the radius of the cross section for the colloidal particle and a liquid particle. Since the particles are not hard spheres with well-defined radii, we expect $R\\propto \\sigma'$, hence $\\gamma_c\\propto\\sigma'$. \n\nIn this work we choose $M=10$ and $\\sigma'=1.5$, which corresponds to the colloidal particle 10 times heavier and 2 times larger than the liquid molecules. Under periodic boundary conditions, the box size must be large enough to avoid possible unrealistic hydrodynamic interactions between the colloidal particle and its periodic replicas. For our simulations, we set the size of $L=21.46$, satisfying $\\sigma'/L < 1/10$. Then 8,000 molecules are employed in simulations.  \n\n\\subsection{Simulations for equilibrium}\n\nWe run the simulations in discrete steps $n$ for $1\\le n\\le N_T$ with an interval $\\Delta t$ for which the differential equations in Eqs.~(\\ref{reservoir}) and (\\ref{colloidal}) are changed into difference equations for states between steps.

Periodic boundary conditions are imposed. Since the LJ potential is long-ranged, it will cost an enormous running-time to sum all the interactions. Instead we set a cut-off distance $r_c$ above which the LJ potential are truncated.  We adopt the parameters from the well established MD studies on the LJ liquids~\\cite{thompson,cieplak}. The particle number density is set by $0.81\\sigma^{-3}$ and the temperature by $1.1\\epsilon/k_B$ for the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, which was found to represent a compressed liquid above the melting temperature. We use $r_c=2.2\\sigma$ for the interactions among the liquid molecules, $r_c=2.2\\sigma'$ for the interactions between the colloidal particle and a liquid molecule. Above $r_c$, the LJ potential was found to be negligible compared to thermal energies.\n\nWe introduce dimensionless variables and parameters used for the simulation. We rescale $M/m\\to M$, $\\mathbf{x}/\\sigma=\\mathbf{x}$, $\\beta^{-1}/\\epsilon\\to \\beta^{-1}$, $t/\\sqrt{m\\sigma^2/\\epsilon}\\to t$. Then $m$, $\\epsilon$, and $\\sigma$ are set to unity, and  $\\sigma'/\\sigma$ to $\\sigma'$. Given the above choice of temperature, $\\beta^{-1}$ goes to $1.1$. In this rescaling, $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j|/\\sigma;1)$ goes to $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_j|; 1)$ and $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_i|/\\sigma; \\sigma'/\\sigma)$ to $V_{\\textrm{LJ}}(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_i|; \\sigma')$.

It is difficult to confirm the FT for $\\Delta S_{\\textrm{tot}}$ in the MD simulations as well as in experiments since the probability distribution is not a directly observable quantity.

In the presence of a time-dependent protocol, that is not our case, $R=W_{irr}=W-\\Delta F$ and the corresponding inequality is $\\langle W_{irr}\\rangle\\ge 0$. The IFT for work was first found by Jarzynski~\\cite{jarzynski}. This inequality is another form of the second law for nonequilibrium work.

The liquid composed of many molecules are designed to play the role of a heat bath at a fixed temperature by using the Langevin thermostat. The colloidal particle and the liquid molecules are designed to interact with each other via the LJ potentials. \n\nWe mimic an experiment in the overdamped limit due a large friction for which we assign larger values of mass and size for the colloidal particle than those of the liquid molecules. We estimate the values of the friction coefficient $\\gamma_{\\textrm{c}}$ originated from the Langevin equation from three methods: the equilibrium and nonequilibrium autocorrelation functions for position in time and the asymptotic production rates of work and heat for infinite $t$. The three values are found to be identical in high accuracy and to hold the Stokes law, which assure us of the reliability of our MD simulations.  \n\nAfter running the simulations for a sufficiently long time in the absence of any nonconservative force for the colloidal particle to reach an equilibrium state, we turn on a nonconservative force with $\\kappa_1\\neq\\kappa_2$ and perform measurements for work and heat produced for time $t$. From $10^5$-$10^6$ samples due to random numbers used for the Langevin thermostat, we find the distribution functions for work and heat. The distribution functions for work for various $t$ are found to  decay exponentially for the both tails of the distribution, from which we confirm the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry. We also confirm the DFT to hold for work, but not for heat, as expected for nonequilibrium processes starting initially from equilibrium states. We observe that the second law of thermodynamics can be violated in individual events while satisfied in average. We discuss the boundary effect on the heat distribution to yield the violation of the DFT for heat.\n\nIn future we will investigate the nonequilibrium motion beyond the overdamped limit by increasing the mass of the colloidal particle or decreasing the friction coefficient. We are also interested in the MD study on other examples driven by different sources of nonequilibrium.  \n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}    \nThis work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through\nthe NRF Grant No.~2013R1A1A2011079 (CK) and 2015R1D1A1A09057469 (YJ), and also by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information with supercomputing resources including technical support (KSC-2015-C1-001). \n\\end{acknowledgments}\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{evans93} {D.

In our case with no time-dependent protocol, we can drop the subscripts $F$, $B$ and expect the DFT as\n\n", "index": 19, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{p(w)}{p(-w)}=e^{\\beta tw}~,\n\\label{FT}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{p(w)}{p(-w)}=e^{\\beta tw}~{},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>w</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></msup></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
