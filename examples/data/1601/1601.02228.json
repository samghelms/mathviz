The same color constancy  is observed in MACHO and EROS colors (Fig. \\ref{fig2}).\nActually, the MACHO color shows the system slightly bluer by 0.01 mag. at quadratures.\nThe almost gray and irregular eclipse is compatible with occultation of the primary by a  inhomogeneous disk dominated by particles of quite large diameters, mixture of grains and dust similar to the discs in $\\varepsilon$ Aur and EE Cep system \\citep{Hoard2010, Galan2012}\n\n\nThe variability of the eclipse shape at different epochs and also short-term quasi-periodic oscillations can be observed in Fig.\\, \\ref{varibilityLCs}.\nThe scatter observed in the $R$-band at certain phases occurs only during one epoch (yellow points) and near secondary eclipse; it could be instrumental error related to problems with removal of H$\\alpha$ luminosity of the background nebulosity or alternatively, reveals changes in H$\\alpha$ emission strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \n     \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{figure/LPV_Model_6500_10_m05_vsin20.pdf}\n          \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{figure/LPV_Model_6500_20_m05_vsin20.pdf}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{figure/ELHC10_and_UVES_template.pdf}\n     \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{figure/spectra49005300_3.pdf}  \n    \\caption{{\\it Upper panel:}  HARPS (2010) spectrum of ELHC\\,10  and synthetic spectra from Coelho et al.

The synthetic spectra with low metallicity were adopted, for which, upper and lower limits of the metallicity were established from the mean values of metallicity distribution derived by \\cite{Carrera2008} for the chemical enrichment history of the LMC. The spectra with effective temperatures \n$3500\\leq T_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\leq 7000$ and surface gravities $0.0\\leq \\log g\\leq 3.0$  were subtracted from our spectrum in the region  3911-3993 \\AA\\  covering the Ca {\\sc ii} H/K  lines in order to find  the residual spectrum with the smaller standard deviation, considered as the best model spectrum.\n\nWe find that a spectrum with $T_{\\mathrm {eff}}=6500$ K, $\\log g = 1.0$ and  [Fe/H]$=-0.5$ reproduces well this part of the HARPS spectrum in 2010. We estimate the accuracy of our adjustment to be $\\pm\\, 250$ K in T$_{eff}$ and $\\pm\\, 0.5$ dex in $\\log g$ and  [Fe/H]. In addition, we used the tabulated effective temperature of supergiants as a function of spectral type  from \\cite{Kovtyukh2007} to independently verify the range of spectral type for ELHC\\,10 based on its $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$: F3 (6700 K)$-$F6 (6270 K), which is consistent with the photometric estimation. \nIn Fig. \\ref{Model} we show the HARPS spectrum taken in 2010 for ELHC\\,10,  along with the best synthetic spectrum and also the spectrum of the standard HD\\,108968 (F7 Ib/II, v\\,$\\sin i = 22 \\pm 1.8$ km/s) taken from the atlas UVES-POP\\footnote{http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/tools/uvespop.html} \\citep{Bagnulo2003}. \n\nThe fact that no veiling was necessary to fit the lines in the spectrum with a supergiant template indicates that most of the optical flux comes from this star, and the contributions of the companion and circumstellar material are very small at these wavelengths.\n \n\n\\subsection{Analysis of the spectral energy distribution}\n\n\nWe compiled fluxes  at different wavelengths from several sources to build the spectral energy distribution (SED)  from optical to far-infrared. Magnitudes $m_{\\lambda}$  \nwere transformed to fluxes $f_{\\lambda}$ using the standard zero magnitude fluxes; the results are shown in Table\\,3. \n\nWe  performed a fit to the SED by means of Marquant-Leveberg non-linear least-square algorithm by minimization of $\\chi^{2}$ of the function:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15671, "prevtext": "\n\n\\label{firstpage}\n\n \n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n{ We investigate the luminous star ELHC 10 located in the bar of the Large Magellanic Cloud, concluding that it is a SB1 long-period eclipsing binary where the main eclipse is produced by an opaque structure hiding the secondary star.

The primary shows signatures of s-process nucleosynthesis and might be a low-mass post-AGB star with a rare evolutionary past if the binary is semi-detached.

The name ELHC\\,10 for this object was proposed by \\citet{Lamers1999} and \n\\citet{deWit2002}, who searched the EROS database for blue objects with irregular photometric behavior similar to Galactic Herbig Ae/\\,Be stars in the LMC bar. ELHC~10 was the \nreddest and brightest star in their sample, with a color $(B -V ) = 0.30$ and  estimated absolute magnitude of $M_{v} = -4.7$. The low resolution spectrum showed emission \nin H${\\alpha}$ with equivalent width of -23 \\AA. Contrary to the other stars in their sample, this star was not an early B star;\nthe spectrum was more compatible with an early F-type giant or supergiant. The spectral type  was estimated  as F2/5 I-II, and the object was included in a sample of HAeBe stars \\citep{deWit2005}. Although Herbig Ae/ Be stars (or HAeBe) are emission-line stars of spectral types O, B, A and in a few cases F, \nand in most instances exhibit IR excesses, which are attributed to dust emission from circumstellar discs, this star is hardly a HAeBe candidate, due to the much \nevolved nature of the luminous component.\n\nIn this paper, we  focus on resolving the uncertainty about the nature of this system by performing an analysis of the stellar components and the surrounding environment. High-resolution spectra and very accurate $BRI$  light curves allowed us to study  ELHC 10  in unprecedented detail for the first time.  We  find that the brightest member of this binary has a low surface gravity and an atmosphere depleted in refractory elements and might be identified as a member of the subclass of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. In addition, we provide evidence for the existence of a circumbinary disc and a circumstellar opaque disc. \n\n\nThere are many substantial evidences for stable and compact Keplerian circumbinary disks around many post-AGB objects \\citep{ de Ruyter2006, Gielen2008, Gielen2009, vanAarle2011, Hillen2013, Hillen2014, Hillen2015, Bujarrabal2015}. Additionally the binary nature of the disc source has been in some cases  confirmed, with the most famous example certainly being HD 44179, better known as the Red Rectangle Nebula (\\citealt{de Ruyter2005, Witt2009, Thomas2012, Mart\u00c3\u00adnez Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez 2015}; \\citealt[][and references therein]{van Winckel 1995}).  Two other important cases  where it has been possible to test the existence of stable Keplerian discs and the correlation with binarity in post-AGB stars have been reported by \\cite{Gorlova2012, Gorlova2015}. Hence, the present work aims to inquire into the nature of ELHC 10 bringing new light on the formation of stable  discs in these binary systems, which are produced presumably  by means of interaction with the companion, when the more massive component becomes either a red giant (RG) or an AGB star. Actually, these amazing and rare systems might represent a new evolutionary channel  that until now has been poorly studied.\n \nIn  Section 2 we present a detailed report of the photometric and spectroscopic observations used in this paper. In Section 3 we analyze these observations to obtain the orbital ephemeris and a preliminary spectral type for the more luminous  component.\nThe spectral energy distribution is also analyzed in this section and a radial velocity study is presented. A study of line profiles yields \nto detailed parameters  of the more prominent star. In  Section 4 we use results of our radial velocity study to get information about masses and offer an interpretation of discrete absorption components (DACs) in terms of mass exchange and mass loss in an interacting binary. Finally, in Section 5 we provide the conclusions of our work. \n\nIn this paper we call the primary star the stellar component whose absorption lines are detected in the spectrum,  while the secondary  is the undetected (and more massive) star. Let's remember that this scenario of a less evolved more massive star can be possible in case of past or present mass transfer by Roche-lobe overflow, as happens in Algols. Quantities relative to these stars are labeled with subindexes {\\it 1} and {\\it 2}, respectively. \n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{figure/N120_MCELS-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n    \\caption[H$\\alpha$ image from MCELS on the center of nebular complex N120.]{H$\\alpha$ image from MCELS on the center of nebular complex N120.

Three  high-resolution spectra were obtained in September 2010, October 2013 and November 2014,\nusing the HARPS Echelle Spectrograph mounted on the ESO 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, Chile. The  two CCD chips on this instrument  sample the spectral range of  3780-6910 \\AA.  The fibres  \nallowed us to obtain spectra at resolving power $\\approx 115 000$. The HARPS spectra do not include the 5304 to 5337 $\\AA$ region, because of the gap between the two detectors. \n \nThree additional spectra were secured with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph at the Clay Telescope in Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, in February 2012  and  December 2013. This double echelle\nspectrograph provided wavelength coverage of 3390-4965 \\AA\\  (blue camera) and 4974-9407 \\AA \\ (red camera). With a slit width of 0.7 arcsec, the resolving power was 40000.  Unfortunately, the two spectra obtained in\nDecember 2013 could not be calibrated in wavelength, but they  were used to perform a qualitative analysis of line shapes.\n\n We also obtained one high-resolution ($R\\approx$ 40000) spectrum with the DuPont Echelle Spectrograph at Las Campanas Observatory, covering the spectral region 4448-7982 \\AA\\  in December of 2010. \n \n All spectra discussed in this work are corrected for earth translational motion and normalized to the continuum. The radial velocities (RVs) are heliocentric.  The data reductions were  done with standard \n {\\it IRAF}\\,\\footnote{IRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National\n Science Foundation.} routines  for echelle spectroscopy, including flat and bias correction, wavelength calibration and order merging. No flux calibration was needed for our purposes. A summary of our spectroscopic\n observations is shown in Table \\ref{Tabla0}.\n \n \\subsection{Photometric data}\n\nWe used the H$\\alpha$ images from the Magellanic Cloud Emission-Line Survey \\citep{Smith1999} to get information about the conditions surrounding the environment of ELHC\\,10. As mentioned above, ELHC\\,10 is located\nnear the nebular complex N\\,120. This complex is composed of smaller nebulae arranged in a bright incomplete ring with the exciting stars  in the centre of the bubble-like nebular complex. Firstly, Henize in 1956 \nseparated the nebula into four brighter overlapping H\\,{\\sc ii} regions: N\\,120 A, B, C and D. Additional  images of this region as those of MCELS, revealed that N\\,120 C was composed of smaller nebulae, denoted C1 to C6,\nas shown in Fig. \\ref{fig1}. The heliocentric velocity of the nebulae C1 to C6 {\\bf were accurately  measured to be between 250} and 263 km\\,s$^{-1}$, with velocity dispersions between 3 to 7 km\\,s$^{-1}$ by \\citet{Laval1992}. \nIn particular, we are interested in the heliocentric velocities of the nebular complex N\\,120 C4 and C5  that are closer to our star; these nebulae have heliocentric velocities between 260 and 261 km\\,s$^{-1}$.\n\n\nMulti-band  and time-series photometry was retrieved from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment in its third phase (OGLE III; \\citealt{Udalski2002}), the Exp\\'erience de Recherche d'Objects Sombres in its second  phase\nEROS-2\\footnote{http://eros.in2p3.fr/} and the Massive Compact Halo Object (MACHOs\\footnote{http://wwwmacho.anu.edu.au/}) project.\n\nThe OGLE III photometry was accumulated  over an interval of almost 8 years, from July 2001 to May 2009, with the 1.3 meter Warsaw telescope located at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The majority of these observations\nwere taken in the $I$-band, typically about 500 points,  but  ELHC\\,10 has OGLE II observations too, which increases the number of points up to 1000. About 40-60 observations ($\\approx 100$ with the OGLE II data) were secured\nin the $V$-band. See \\cite{Soszynski2009} for more information about the {\\bf obtention of OGLE photometric data.}\n\nThe EROS-2 observations  were obtained using the  1 m Ritchey-Chr\\'etien Telescope at ESO, La Silla-Chile. The telescope was equipped with two cameras, each camera contained eight $2048\\,\\times\\,2048$ detectors mounted in a mosaic\npattern. The pixel size is $0.6''$, with a typical seeing of $2''$ FWHM at the site. The EROS-2 Photometric System consisted of a  $B_{\\mathrm E}$ (420-720 nm, blue) band and $R_{\\mathrm E}$ (620-920 nm, red) band. \nThe  $B_{\\mathrm E}$  band  is close to the Johnson $V$-band, but it is broader. The  $R_{\\mathrm E}$ band is intermediate between the bands of Cousins $R$ and $I$. The photometric points obtained using  the $B$-band \ngenerally have  better accuracy  than in the $R$-band \\citep{Grison1995, Ansari2001}.\n\n The MACHO survey provides instrumental magnitudes for each star in two contiguous ``blue'' and ``red'' passbands, labeled $B$ and $R$, at different effective wavelengths than the standard B and R passbands in the Johnson-Cousins\n photometric system \\citep{Alcock1999}.

OGLE II has a median seeing for the entire dataset of about $1.3''$, and the uncertainty of the zero-point is \nless than 0.02 mag \\citep{Udalski2000}.

The synthetic spectra with low metallicity were adopted, for which, upper and lower limits of the metallicity were established from the mean values of metallicity distribution derived by \\cite{Carrera2008} for the chemical enrichment history of the LMC. The spectra with effective temperatures \n$3500\\leq T_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\leq 7000$ and surface gravities $0.0\\leq \\log g\\leq 3.0$  were subtracted from our spectrum in the region  3911-3993 \\AA\\  covering the Ca {\\sc ii} H/K  lines in order to find  the residual spectrum with the smaller standard deviation, considered as the best model spectrum.\n\nWe find that a spectrum with $T_{\\mathrm {eff}}=6500$ K, $\\log g = 1.0$ and  [Fe/H]$=-0.5$ reproduces well this part of the HARPS spectrum in 2010. We estimate the accuracy of our adjustment to be $\\pm\\, 250$ K in T$_{eff}$ and $\\pm\\, 0.5$ dex in $\\log g$ and  [Fe/H]. In addition, we used the tabulated effective temperature of supergiants as a function of spectral type  from \\cite{Kovtyukh2007} to independently verify the range of spectral type for ELHC\\,10 based on its $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$: F3 (6700 K)$-$F6 (6270 K), which is consistent with the photometric estimation. \nIn Fig. \\ref{Model} we show the HARPS spectrum taken in 2010 for ELHC\\,10,  along with the best synthetic spectrum and also the spectrum of the standard HD\\,108968 (F7 Ib/II, v\\,$\\sin i = 22 \\pm 1.8$ km/s) taken from the atlas UVES-POP\\footnote{http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/tools/uvespop.html} \\citep{Bagnulo2003}. \n\nThe fact that no veiling was necessary to fit the lines in the spectrum with a supergiant template indicates that most of the optical flux comes from this star, and the contributions of the companion and circumstellar material are very small at these wavelengths.\n \n\n\\subsection{Analysis of the spectral energy distribution}\n\n\nWe compiled fluxes  at different wavelengths from several sources to build the spectral energy distribution (SED)  from optical to far-infrared.

The spectral lines are redshifted by amounts of roughly 3 \\AA, typical for LMC stars. Interesting, \nsome metallic lines are split in discrete absorption components  (Fig.\\,6). \nLine identification was made by comparing line positions with theoretical line wavelengths \\citep{Kurucz1993}. Radial velocities (RVs) were measured by calculating the positions of the line centre with a \nGaussian fit using the IRAF {\\it SPLOT} task.

The measures reflect very well the orbital motion of the primary (Fig.\\,7).\n\nWe assume a circular orbit and fit the  RVs with a sine function of the form:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 26304, "prevtext": "\n\n\\noindent and $f_{1}$ is the flux of the primary star, $k( \\lambda-V)\\equiv E(\\lambda-V)/E(B-V)$ is the normalized extinction curve, $R(V)\\equiv A(\\lambda)/E(B-V)$  is the ratio of extinction at $V$ to reddening, $d$ is the distance to the binary and $R_{1}$ is the primary physical radius.

The spectral lines are redshifted by amounts of roughly 3 \\AA, typical for LMC stars. Interesting, \nsome metallic lines are split in discrete absorption components  (Fig.\\,6). \nLine identification was made by comparing line positions with theoretical line wavelengths \\citep{Kurucz1993}. Radial velocities (RVs) were measured by calculating the positions of the line centre with a \nGaussian fit using the IRAF {\\it SPLOT} task. In the case where lines were blended, we employed a deblending method to isolate the components  by fitting multiple gaussians to the observed profiles.\nWe performed this task with the {\\it IRAF} deblending `d' routine available in the  {\\it SPLOT} package.\n\nFirstly, we measured RVs of  lines clearly representative of the primary motion.

Because our star is located in the LMC, \nan important contribution of interstellar medium to the sodium lines would not be expected, due to the low metallicity. \nFrom the above we deduce that the material contributing to the extra absorption components in the  \nNaD line comes from circumstellar  material of  high optical depth  in the binary system. \n\nSuch behavior in the shape of the spectral features in  Na\\,{\\sc i}  lines is similarly observed in the Fe {\\sc ii} and Ti {\\sc ii} lines.   \nBut quite different are the changes in the shape of ions such as Ba\\,{\\sc ii}, Mg\\,{\\sc ii} and Ca\\,{\\sc i-ii} which usually do not show DACs (Fig.  \\ref{FeBa_II}). \n\n\n\n \n \\subsection{Fe {\\sc i} and Fe  {\\sc ii}  profiles } \\label{Iron_line}\n \n \nThe variations in the profiles in both Fe {\\sc ii} 4923 and 5018  lines are\nhard to interpret in terms of simple changes in the stellar atmospheric\nparameters, such as the effective temperature, surface gravity\nand microturbulent velocity (Fig.\\, \\ref{fig6}). \nActually, multiple components in\nthe iron lines, up to 4 components, can sometimes appear.\nThese components are characterized by different line widths, \nrevealing different physical conditions in the formation regions. \nA similar behavior (unexplained)  is reported in the interacting binary candidate\n {\\hbox{OGLE004633.76$-$731204.3}}\\, which harbors an A-type supergiant \\citep{Mennickent2010b}.\nIn Fig. \\ref{RVs_FeII} we show the radial velocities of 3 components of Fe\n{\\sc ii} line at 5018 \\AA. It is clear how the photospheric line follows the primary motion,\nnarrow stationary components remain stable with the velocity of the system center of mass,\nand DACs move from the blue to the red side of the photospheric\nline. A similar behavior is followed by DACs in other metallic lines.\n\n\nThe apparition of these variable and complex double-bottomed shapes in the profile of metallic lines in iron-groups elements, probably reflects large-scale motions with different  radial velocities,\nin shock regions, possible representing multiples layers in between the stars. In addition, these spectral characteristics appear and are stronger at or near quadratures and disappear during secondary eclipse, \nas evident in the 2012 spectrum in Figs. \\ref{NaI} and \\ref{FeBa_II}. All this behavior of features strongly modulated with the orbital period suggests that DACs are produced in gas streams inside the  binary system. \n\n \\begin{figure}\n    \n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figure/BaII_Rest_Frame.pdf}\n \n    \\caption{The Fe\\,{\\sc ii} 4923 \\AA\\ and Ba\\,{\\sc ii} 4934 \\AA\\ lines show the apparition of RACs and BACs and drastic changes with orbital phase in Fe\\,{\\sc ii}  4923 \\AA, \n    whereas Ba\\,{\\sc ii}  4934  \\AA\\ is less affected by circumstellar material.

This fact suggests that s-process enrichment has taken place in the primary. \n In order to calculate the abundances of $\\alpha$-elements and s-process species, we used the MIKE spectrum obtained on February 07, 2012 for analysis. This observation was carried out near maximum light at a phase ($\\Phi=0.47$) corresponding to the superior conjunction of the post-AGB star, when its obscuration by the circumstellar disc and the contribution from secondary star should be minimal. Additional to this, the metallic lines at this phase do not present DACs and were nearly symmetric and hence easy to measure providing unblended lines (Fig. \\ref{S-elements}).\n\nThe abundances are calculated using suitable programs coupled with\nstate-of-the-art atmospheric models \\citep{Sneden1973, Kurucz1993} using the LTE approximation, as usual in the abundance analysis of post-AGB stars (e.g. \\citealt{vanAarle2013}). \nWe used as input parameters the effective temperature and surface gravity derived from our spectroscopic analysis (Section 3.2). Microturbulence velocity is obtained by removing any slope \nin the relation between the abundance from Fe\\,{\\sc i}  lines and the reduced EWs.\nAbundances for all the other elements are obtained from EW measurements.\nUsually cool stars show no evidence of significant rotation, so EWs are \nobtained from simple Gaussian fitting of spectral features. The NLTE effects should alter the ionization structure compared with the LTE model, but at the mild low metallicity and effective temperature of ELHC\\,10 this effect should be less than 0.1 dex for Fe {\\sc i} and 0.01 dex for Fe {\\sc ii} \\citep{Mashonkina2011}. In any case, the effective temperature derived by us comes from the comparison with the synthetic stellar spectra library, and does not depend on the LTE assumption.\n\n The final abundance analysis of the ELHC\\,10 primary yields  the parameters shown in  Table\\,7, where $Z$ is the proton number and $N$ represents the number of lines used for the abundance determination of the species. The iron abundance [Fe\\,{\\sc i} /\\,H]$=-0.38$ is  consistent with a star located in the low metallicity environment of the LMC.\n \nDerived abundances for the ELHC\\,10 primary are plotted in Fig.   \\ref{Abundance}. The simple mean of the [X/Fe] ratio for the $\\alpha$-elements  Si, S, Ca and Ti, \n is [$\\alpha$/Fe]= $0.40\\pm0.14$, normal when compared with Galactic objects in this metallicity range, and consistent with the  $\\alpha$-enhancement  expected for LMC stars at their respective metallicities \\citep{Pompeia2008, Van der Swaelmen2013}.  In Fig.  \\ref{Abundance} we also compare the derived abundances of ELHC 10 with the abundances of J053253.51$-$695915.1, which is a post-AGB star confirmed in the LMC \\citep{vanAarle2013}. It is clear that the primary of ELHC\\,10 shows light s-process elements (magic neutron number 50) around Y and Zr which confirms the post-second dredge-up status of our star \\citep{vanWinckel2003}.\n\nAs a by-product of our abundance analysis we calculated a microturbulence velocity of $\\xi_{t}=6.8$ $\\pm$ 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and an upper limit for the projected rotational velocity of $20 \\pm5$  km s$^{-1}$. \nThe last figure comes from the width of the wings of the line profiles considering that a contribution of macro-turbulent velocity is also present. \n\n  \n\\begin{table}\\label{Abundance}\n\\caption{Abundances for ELHC\\,10. $N$ represents the number  of lines used for the abundance determination of the species.

(2002) and neglecting the bolometric correction for a mid-F supergiant \\citep{2000asqu.book.....C}  we get  $L=5 970\\,L_{\\odot}$ and the previous value is confirmed.\n We have compared the luminosity and temperature of the primary with the evolutionary tracks of single stars at metallicity $Z$ = 0.006 provided by Georgy et al. (2013). \nThe primary closely fits the model of an initially (and present) 8.1 M$_{\\odot}$ star at an age of $3.18\\times 10^{7}$ yr but with a relatively large surface gravity log\\,g = 1.79 (Fig.  \\ref{HRdiag}).  This high mass primary \n does not fit our results for the mass range and surface gravity inferred from the SED and the spectrum as given in Section 3.3. Moreover, it produces a problematic very high mass secondary \n as we will show in the next Section.\n\n\n\\subsection{Constraints on the mass of the unseen secondary star and the semidetached case }\\label{mass-ratio}\n\n\nWe calculate the mass function $f(m)$ defined for a single-lined spectroscopic binary as \\citep{Hilditch2001}:\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 33789, "prevtext": "\n\n\\noindent\nConsidering all velocities with equal statistical weight we  find a system velocity $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{1}}=264.935\\pm 0.432$ km\\,s$^{-1}$, semi-amplitude $K_{\\mathrm{1}}=68.639\\pm 0.563$ km\\,s$^{-1}$ \nwith rms 6 km\\,s$^{-1}$ and phase shift $\\Phi_{0}=-0.460\\pm 0.01$.  The existence of a small phase shift between the spectroscopic and photometric ephemerides is compatible with the fact that we use the ephemerides for the very minimum of the light curve, which is shifted by about $+0.05$ from the minimum of the light curve assuming symmetrical eclipse.\nWe reviewed the spectra throughout the spectral range to find  that there is no indication for the secondary component even at minimum. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Radial velocity study of non-photospheric lines}\n\nThe other prominent lines seen in the spectra are due to Ca\\,{\\sc ii}, Na\\,{\\sc i} and a large number of lines from Fe\\,{\\sc ii}, Ti\\,{\\sc ii}, Na\\,{\\sc i} and Si {\\sc ii} and other species. \nThey display  line splitting as discrete red or blue extra absorptions depending on the phase in which the spectrum was obtained. These DACs were  denominated RACs or BACs; they are not due to \nanother stellar component   because their variable morphology is incompatible with this assumption. Once the orbital motion of the primary was determined, DACs were clearly identified in the \nlines. In this section we report the RV measurements of these DACs.\n\n \\begin{figure}\n    \n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figure/NaI_D1_D2_final.pdf}\n   \n    \\caption{Na\\,{\\sc i }\\,D\\,{\\small1} and D\\,{\\small2} lines  as a function of the heliocentric wavelength. \n    The dashed lines mark  our systemic velocity of 265 km\\,s$^{-1}$ for each line, the red points indicate the photospheric velocity of the F-supergiant star. \n    The spectrum of the  standard HD 108968 is overplotted as illustration at phase 0.22.

Because our star is located in the LMC, \nan important contribution of interstellar medium to the sodium lines would not be expected, due to the low metallicity. \nFrom the above we deduce that the material contributing to the extra absorption components in the  \nNaD line comes from circumstellar  material of  high optical depth  in the binary system. \n\nSuch behavior in the shape of the spectral features in  Na\\,{\\sc i}  lines is similarly observed in the Fe {\\sc ii} and Ti {\\sc ii} lines.   \nBut quite different are the changes in the shape of ions such as Ba\\,{\\sc ii}, Mg\\,{\\sc ii} and Ca\\,{\\sc i-ii} which usually do not show DACs (Fig.  \\ref{FeBa_II}). \n\n\n\n \n \\subsection{Fe {\\sc i} and Fe  {\\sc ii}  profiles } \\label{Iron_line}\n \n \nThe variations in the profiles in both Fe {\\sc ii} 4923 and 5018  lines are\nhard to interpret in terms of simple changes in the stellar atmospheric\nparameters, such as the effective temperature, surface gravity\nand microturbulent velocity (Fig.\\, \\ref{fig6}). \nActually, multiple components in\nthe iron lines, up to 4 components, can sometimes appear.\nThese components are characterized by different line widths, \nrevealing different physical conditions in the formation regions. \nA similar behavior (unexplained)  is reported in the interacting binary candidate\n {\\hbox{OGLE004633.76$-$731204.3}}\\, which harbors an A-type supergiant \\citep{Mennickent2010b}.\nIn Fig. \\ref{RVs_FeII} we show the radial velocities of 3 components of Fe\n{\\sc ii} line at 5018 \\AA. It is clear how the photospheric line follows the primary motion,\nnarrow stationary components remain stable with the velocity of the system center of mass,\nand DACs move from the blue to the red side of the photospheric\nline. A similar behavior is followed by DACs in other metallic lines.\n\n\nThe apparition of these variable and complex double-bottomed shapes in the profile of metallic lines in iron-groups elements, probably reflects large-scale motions with different  radial velocities,\nin shock regions, possible representing multiples layers in between the stars. In addition, these spectral characteristics appear and are stronger at or near quadratures and disappear during secondary eclipse, \nas evident in the 2012 spectrum in Figs. \\ref{NaI} and \\ref{FeBa_II}. All this behavior of features strongly modulated with the orbital period suggests that DACs are produced in gas streams inside the  binary system. \n\n \\begin{figure}\n    \n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figure/BaII_Rest_Frame.pdf}\n \n    \\caption{The Fe\\,{\\sc ii} 4923 \\AA\\ and Ba\\,{\\sc ii} 4934 \\AA\\ lines show the apparition of RACs and BACs and drastic changes with orbital phase in Fe\\,{\\sc ii}  4923 \\AA, \n    whereas Ba\\,{\\sc ii}  4934  \\AA\\ is less affected by circumstellar material.

This fact suggests that s-process enrichment has taken place in the primary. \n In order to calculate the abundances of $\\alpha$-elements and s-process species, we used the MIKE spectrum obtained on February 07, 2012 for analysis. This observation was carried out near maximum light at a phase ($\\Phi=0.47$) corresponding to the superior conjunction of the post-AGB star, when its obscuration by the circumstellar disc and the contribution from secondary star should be minimal. Additional to this, the metallic lines at this phase do not present DACs and were nearly symmetric and hence easy to measure providing unblended lines (Fig. \\ref{S-elements}).\n\nThe abundances are calculated using suitable programs coupled with\nstate-of-the-art atmospheric models \\citep{Sneden1973, Kurucz1993} using the LTE approximation, as usual in the abundance analysis of post-AGB stars (e.g. \\citealt{vanAarle2013}). \nWe used as input parameters the effective temperature and surface gravity derived from our spectroscopic analysis (Section 3.2). Microturbulence velocity is obtained by removing any slope \nin the relation between the abundance from Fe\\,{\\sc i}  lines and the reduced EWs.\nAbundances for all the other elements are obtained from EW measurements.\nUsually cool stars show no evidence of significant rotation, so EWs are \nobtained from simple Gaussian fitting of spectral features. The NLTE effects should alter the ionization structure compared with the LTE model, but at the mild low metallicity and effective temperature of ELHC\\,10 this effect should be less than 0.1 dex for Fe {\\sc i} and 0.01 dex for Fe {\\sc ii} \\citep{Mashonkina2011}. In any case, the effective temperature derived by us comes from the comparison with the synthetic stellar spectra library, and does not depend on the LTE assumption.\n\n The final abundance analysis of the ELHC\\,10 primary yields  the parameters shown in  Table\\,7, where $Z$ is the proton number and $N$ represents the number of lines used for the abundance determination of the species. The iron abundance [Fe\\,{\\sc i} /\\,H]$=-0.38$ is  consistent with a star located in the low metallicity environment of the LMC.\n \nDerived abundances for the ELHC\\,10 primary are plotted in Fig.   \\ref{Abundance}. The simple mean of the [X/Fe] ratio for the $\\alpha$-elements  Si, S, Ca and Ti, \n is [$\\alpha$/Fe]= $0.40\\pm0.14$, normal when compared with Galactic objects in this metallicity range, and consistent with the  $\\alpha$-enhancement  expected for LMC stars at their respective metallicities \\citep{Pompeia2008, Van der Swaelmen2013}.

It is clear that the primary of ELHC\\,10 shows light s-process elements (magic neutron number 50) around Y and Zr which confirms the post-second dredge-up status of our star \\citep{vanWinckel2003}.\n\nAs a by-product of our abundance analysis we calculated a microturbulence velocity of $\\xi_{t}=6.8$ $\\pm$ 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and an upper limit for the projected rotational velocity of $20 \\pm5$  km s$^{-1}$. \nThe last figure comes from the width of the wings of the line profiles considering that a contribution of macro-turbulent velocity is also present. \n\n  \n\\begin{table}\\label{Abundance}\n\\caption{Abundances for ELHC\\,10. $N$ represents the number  of lines used for the abundance determination of the species.

(2002) and neglecting the bolometric correction for a mid-F supergiant \\citep{2000asqu.book.....C}  we get  $L=5 970\\,L_{\\odot}$ and the previous value is confirmed.\n We have compared the luminosity and temperature of the primary with the evolutionary tracks of single stars at metallicity $Z$ = 0.006 provided by Georgy et al. (2013). \nThe primary closely fits the model of an initially (and present) 8.1 M$_{\\odot}$ star at an age of $3.18\\times 10^{7}$ yr but with a relatively large surface gravity log\\,g = 1.79 (Fig.  \\ref{HRdiag}).  This high mass primary \n does not fit our results for the mass range and surface gravity inferred from the SED and the spectrum as given in Section 3.3. Moreover, it produces a problematic very high mass secondary \n as we will show in the next Section.\n\n\n\\subsection{Constraints on the mass of the unseen secondary star and the semidetached case }\\label{mass-ratio}\n\n\nWe calculate the mass function $f(m)$ defined for a single-lined spectroscopic binary as \\citep{Hilditch2001}:\n\n\n\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{9}\nf (m) = \\frac{M_{1}sin^{3}i}{q(1+q)^{2}} = 1.0361\\times10^{-7}\\, K_{1}^{3}\\, P\\, \\rm{M}_{\\sun},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f(m)=\\frac{M_{1}sin^{3}i}{q(1+q)^{2}}=1.0361\\times 10^{-7}\\,K_{1}^{3}\\,P\\,\\rm{%&#10;M}_{\\sun},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>m</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>n</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>1.0361</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow></msup></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msubsup><mi>K</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></msubsup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>P</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mi><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\sun</mtext></merror></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02228.tex", "nexttext": "\n where $P_{0}$ is the orbital period in hours (e.g. \\citealt{Frank2002}).  For  ELHC\\,10 we find $\\bar{\\rho}=3.9\\times10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$. Using this value, the radius derived in the previous section and assuming spherical symmetry  we calculate a mass for the primary $M_{1}\\approx 0.625\\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. Surprisingly, this is very near the mass of a Post-AGB star with the observed luminosity.\nIn fact, using the  luminosity-core mass relation given by \\citet{Wood1981} we obtain  $M_{1}=0.63\\,M_{\\odot}$,  \nwhich fits the primary mass  restrictions derived in Section 3.3.\nWith this mass we get a mass-ratio $q= 0.07$ (for $i$ = 90$^{o}$) and  a mass for the unseen secondary star $M_{2}= 8.6$ \\,M$_{\\odot}$, consisting of a main-sequence B2\\,V star.\nWe conclude that an hypothetical  semidetached configuration should imply a low-mass primary consistent with a Post-AGB classification,  as is discussed in the next section.\n \n\n\n\\subsection{Exploring the association with N120}\n\nThe association with N120 yields interesting clues on the history of the system.\nN120 is a young association: the presence of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions and a SNR suggest an age of \nabout 10\\,Myr \\citep{Laval1992}. This age imposes a problem for  the evolutionary stage of the low-mass primary. There has not been  enough time for the\nlow-mass primary to evolve to the observed supergiant stage. The problem disappears  if \nthe primary has evolved from an initially  higher mass star in an evolutionary channel strongly influenced by the presence of the binary companion.\nFor instance,  the primary could have lost significant amounts of matter by Roche lobe overflow during  a semidetached stage as happens in Algols.  In this case, a primary of several solar masses\nis expected in ELHC\\,10 before mass ratio reversal, since the total mass is about 7 or 9 solar masses. On the contrary, a low mass progenitor is expected for the evolution of a single post-AGB star. \nEvolutionary tracks for single AGB stars have been published by \\citet{Vassiliadis1994}. \nExtrapolating these models (that are for $Z=0.001$) to the mass of ELHC\\,10 we find  mass for the progenitor of 1.5 $\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ \\citep{DeSmedt2012}. \nPossibly the evolution have followed a different path in the post-AGB star of ELHC\\,10, because of the presence of the companion and epochs of significant mass transfer.  \nThis conjecture is consistent with the existence of massive post-AGB stars ($M \\la 8 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$; \\citealt{Ventura2015}). \n Since the amount of mass lost by the system during this process is hard to know, we cannot reconstruct the history \nof the binary and the evolutionary track up to the progenitors. \n\nWe notice that the expected progenitor for a 0.62 M$_{\\odot}$ post-AGB stars is  1.5 $\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. \nIt is impossible that this star has evolved to the current evolutionary stage {\\it as a single star} if we assume  the same age as the nebular complex N120.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\\subsection{H$\\alpha$ emission and discs}\\label{halpha}\n\nH$\\alpha$  is the most intense line in the  spectra and shows a double-peak emission, broad wings extending from 6557 to 6582 \\AA\\ and a mean separation of the blue and red peak of $\\approx 115$   \nkm\\,s$^{-1}$  with the blue peak approximately equal to the red peak.  The H$\\alpha$ emission is characterized by several parameters whose values are given in Table\\,8. The strong H$\\alpha$ double-peak emission is consistent with \nthe presence of an emitting disc. The central absorption component in the H$\\alpha$ profile remains with the same radial  velocity in spite of changes in the radial velocity  of the primary over\nthe years (see Fig.\\,\\ref{balmer} and Table\\, 8). The same occurs for the position of the violet and red emission peaks. The velocity of the central core  is  $-5\\pm 1$ km\\,s$^{-1}$, blue shifted from the systemic velocity, \ni.e. at velocity 260  km\\,s$^{-1}$. \nThe constancy of this velocity  is possible if (i) the disc is around a star considerably more massive than the primary, therefore it performs small (undetected) motions around the system center of mass or \n(ii) most of the emission comes from a slowly expanding circumbinary disc extending beyond the binary to considerable distances, producing a column density large enough to produce the almost stationary H$\\alpha$ \ncentral absorption. In the following we give arguments favoring this last possibility.\n\nEmission from a circumbinary disc is consistent with the fact  that the velocity of the H$\\alpha$ central absorption  is practically the same as the velocity of\n the nebular complex N 120 C4 and C5 that are close to our star; viz. 260 km\\,s$^{-1}$ (Section 2.2).\n\n\nIt is also consistent with the detection of stationary N\\,{\\sc ii} 6548, 6583 \\AA\\ forbidden emission lines, which are commonly attributed to low density material in the circumstellar environment. \nIt is possible that the H$\\alpha$ emitting disc extends into the interstellar medium to zones of low density where forbidden emission lines are produced. \n\nThe circumbinary disc should be optically thin, to explain the steep Balmer emission decrement, and contribute with free-free emission to the system at infrared wavelengths (Fig.\\,5). In addition, \nthe large H$\\alpha$ central absorption indicates strong self-absorption, this is possible if the disc is coplanar (or almost coplanar) with the binary. Finally, the disc is not eclipsed by the primary, as reveals the\nH$\\alpha$ equivalent width during secondary eclipse (Table 8).\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\\label{Table3}\n\\caption{H$\\alpha$ equivalent widths, intensities of the blue and red emission peaks normalized to the underlying continuum, intensity of the central depression,\nRV of the overall profile, peak separation, full width at half-maximum and circumstellar reddening caused by  the H$\\alpha$ emitting envelope  \\citep{Dachs1988}.}\n\\begin{tabular}{llccccccccc}\n\\hline\nPhase & Instrument & -EW & I$_{\\mathrm{V}}$/I$_{\\mathrm{Cont.}}$ & I$_{\\mathrm{R}}$/\\,I$_{\\mathrm{Cont.}}$ & I$_{\\mathrm{C}}$/\\,I$_{\\mathrm{Cont.}}$ &I$_{\\mathrm{V}}$/\\,I$_{\\mathrm{R}}$ & RV$_{\\mathrm{mean}}$ & $\\Delta$ V$_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ & FWHM & E$_{\\mathrm{(B-V)}}^{\\mathrm{CE}}$\\\\\n &   & (\\AA)& & & & & (km\\,s$^{-1}$) & (km\\,s$^{-1}$) & (km\\,s$^{-1}$) & (mag)\\\\\\hline\n 0.04 & HARPS (2014) & 25.5 & 6.19   & 5.91 &  0.42 &1.05 & 260 &  112 & 304  & 0.05\\\\\n 0.22 & HARPS (2010) & 26.0 & 4.31 & 4.24  & 0.33 &1.02 & 260 & 118 & 269 & 0.05 \\\\\n0.25 & HARPS (2013) & 22.8 & 5.07 & 5.04  & 0.45 &1.01 & 259 & 114 &  244&  0.05\\\\\n0.47 & MIKE (2012) & 24.5  & 6.03   & 6.30 &0.29 &0.96 & 260 &112 & 247& 0.05\\\\\n0.62 &  ECHELLE (2010) & 21.3 & 3.98 & 4.34 & 0.19 &0.92 & 262 &  110 & 234   &  0.04\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe circumbinary disc analyzed in this section is different from the opaque structure around the secondary.\nIn fact, Balmer emission can be produced in a relatively hot disc (T $\\sim$ 10.000 $K$) but the opaque structure (probably another disc) around the secondary is cool; it does not contribute significantly \nto the flux in the optical region as evident from the constancy of line depths during the orbital cycle, even during eclipse  (Fig.\\, \\ref{FeBa_II}). \n Coexistent circumstellar and circumbinary discs have been also found in some post-AGB binaries \\citep{Gorlova2012, Gorlova2015, Hillen2013, Hillen2014, Hillen2015}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{On the line splitting observed in ELHC\\,10 }\n\nLine splitting is a very particular property of ELHC\\,10. It is observed in metallic lines, especially lines of Fe\\,{\\sc i},  Fe\\,{\\sc ii}  and Ti\\,{\\sc ii},\nbut disappears near secondary minimum at $\\Phi_{o}$ = 0.47. Since these lines are stronger at this phase, it is possible that DACs and photospheric lines are blended. Line splitting are not observed in Ba\\,{\\sc ii}, Ca\\,{\\sc i}, Mg\\,{\\sc ii} and Si\\,{\\sc ii} lines except during main eclipse at phase \n $\\Phi_{o}$ = 0.04 (at least Ba\\,{\\sc ii} and Si\\,{\\sc ii} that are spectrally covered at this phase). Line splitting occurs in the form of DACs displaced to the red or blue side of the photospheric line.  \n \n \n\n Line splitting has been observed in lines of \nheavy elements in post-AGB stars with C-rich circumstellar environments and explained by\nstructured atmospheres \\citep{2015AstL...41...14K}. For instance, in V\\,5112\\,Sgr \nthe Ba\\,{\\sc ii} line profiles are split in multiple components \\citep{Klochkova2013}. The case of ELHC\\,10\nis different, since its primary is not carbon-rich and the alternated visibility of \nDACs during the orbital cycle exclude any interpretation in terms of an structured envelope.  In fact, lines formed in an structured envelope around the primary should follow the primary motion during\nthe orbital cycle with a blue velocity shift, but not move from the red to the blue side of a line formed in the photosphere. In addition, we do not  observe DACs in ELHC~10 only in s-process elements, as\nin V\\,5112\\,Sgr, but also in metallic lines of light elements. \n\nIn ELHC\\,10 DACs are probably formed by occultation of the primary photosphere by dense and extended gas regions co-rotating with the binary. This view is supported by the large strength of the features and their \nradial velocity behavior.  Since the number of available spectra is limited,  we cannot go deeper in this interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence for interaction has been observed in the Galactic post-AGB star BD$+$46$^{o}$ 442,  an evolved binary with gas streams, jets and disc \\citep{Gorlova2012}. \nContrary to ELHC\\,10, this last system shows strong orbital variability at the H$\\alpha$ emission; this line has been interpreted\nas formed in the disc around the secondary and the H$\\alpha$ blue-shifted absorption in terms of a disc jet \\citep{Gorlova2012}. \\\\\n\n\n\\subsection{ELHC\\,10 in the context of post-AGB binaries}\n\n70 high probability and 1337 candidate post-AGB LMC stars have been catalogued by \\cite{vanAarle2011}. About half of them are probably binaries, a distinction made based on the shape of the spectral energy distribution,\nindicating a stable and likely Keplerian disc. This is a surprising result, since one could expect that the residual material  from the AGB mass loss should be found in an expanding envelope. \nTherefore, it has been suggested that the formation of a circumbinary disc plays a major role in the evolution of post-AGB  systems \\citep{2007BaltA..16..112V}.\nVery few of these binaries have been studied in detail. To our knowledge, ELHC 10 could be the first post-AGB binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the post-AGB binary with the highest progenitor mass and the highest-mass companion known.\n\n\n\nHitherto the process of disc formation in post-AGB stars remains obscure. For instance, \n\\citet{Livio1988} and \\citet{1998ApJ...500..909S}  showed that the disc can be the result of the AGB evolution after engulfing the companion with a common envelope. \nOther scenario proposes a disc-like structure formed by wind accretion \\citep{Mastrodemos1999}. Finally, \nthe disc can be the result of interaction between the AGB wind and the disc jet \\citep{Akashi2008}.  While these scenarios can be possible in some systems at some evolutionary stages, the current observations of ELHC\\,10 suggest that equatorial\nmass loss through the outer Lagrangian points could form a circumbinary disc.  This is consistent with Roche-lobe overflow and the presence of a large and thick disc surrounding the secondary star.\nThe kind of outflows that possibly explain the DACs have been predicted  by hydrodynamical simulations of gas dynamics in close interacting binaries \\citep{Bisikalo2003, Sytov2007}.  To accept this view,\nwe need to assume a non-standard evolution for the post-AGB star, as explained in Section 4.3. \n\n\n\\section[]{Conclusion}\n\nIn this paper we have studied the very interesting and complex eclipsing binary ELHC\\,10, located in the young nebular complex N120 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nWhile we have determined solid constrains for some parameters of the system, some others remains unbounded. The following is a list of our main conclusions:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item We find that ELHC\\,10 is a SB1 long-period eclipsing binary with the main eclipse  produced by a dark structure hiding the secondary star. \n\\item For the primary we determined an effective temperature of 6500 $\\pm$ 250 $K$, log\\,g  = 1.0 $\\pm$ 0.5 and luminosity 5970 L$_{\\sun}$.\n\\item From their radial velocities  we find a mass function of  7.37 $\\pm$ 0.55 M$_{\\sun}$.\n\\item If the primary fills its Roche lobe it also fits the core-luminosity relationship of a post-AGB star with a mass of  0.625 M$_{\\sun}$. The abundance pattern is consistent with this classification.\n\\item A 8.1 M$_{\\sun}$ primary fits the observed luminosity and temperature in a detached configuration, but implies a secondary of at least 16 M$_{\\sun}$ and it is hard to explain why this high-mass star is not visible and does not heat their surrounding dark structure. Another problem with the high-mass primary is its late evolutionary stage, since the unseen secondary should be far more evolved, larger and luminous.\n\\item The very likely  membership to the young nebular complex N120 suggests that the only way for the primary to has arrived to the observed\nadvanced evolutionary stage (low-mass primary case) is from an initially much more massive star, something that could has occurred\nby mass transfer due to Roche lobe overflow in a semidetached binary.\n\\item We find a prominent stationary H$\\alpha$ double emission line which we attribute to a circumbinary disc. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\item We discovered line splitting of metallic lines characterized by discrete absorption components (DACs) observed alternatively at the blue and red side of the photospheric\nline profiles during the orbital cycle. \n\\item These DACs are similar in appearance to those observed in carbon-rich post-AGB stars \\citep{2015AstL...41...14K}, \nbut cannot be interpreted as evidence for structured atmosphere as done by these authors for carbon-rich post-AGB systems. \n\\item One possible interpretation for the DACs  observed in ELHC\\,10 are gas streams in an interacting  binary. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\n\n\nWe thank W.

The possible masses for the secondary for a range of possible inclinations and primary masses, are shown in Fig.  \\ref{massfunction}. \n\nIt is clear that the secondary is always more massive that the primary.  Since it is not detected either in the continuum or  in the line spectrum probably it is hidden by the eclipsing structure.\n\nWe notice that, according to equation (6),  a primary of 8.1 M$_{\\odot}$ implies a (unseen) secondary of at least 16 M$_{\\odot}$. It is hard to explain why this high mass star does not heat the dark cool eclipsing structure. Let's remember  that to explain the equal depth in the eclipses at different bandpasses {\\it and} the similar strength of  the lines inside/outside the main eclipse a dark\ncool structure is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figure/Halpha_Final_LPV_2.pdf}\n    \\caption{The HARPS (2010, 2013, 2014), MIKE (2012) and ECHELLE (2010) spectra showing  H$\\alpha$ profile and N {\\sc ii} emission lines.
