We assume normally distributed\nuncertainties. Therefore, the log-likelihood of a parameter vector is\ngiven by $\\ln(\\mathbf{p}) = C -\\chi^2 / 2$, where $C$ is a normalization\nconstant that cancels out in the likelihood ratio, and $\\chi^2$ is the\nusual chi-squared statistic.\n\nEvery ten iterations (the thinning interval), the current chain values\n$\\mathbf{X}$ are appended to the history array $\\mathbf{Z}$. Note that\nonce the chains are appended to $\\mathbf{Z}$, they lose identity, so\nthat the difference vectors that determine the step for any one chain\ndepends on the history of all three chains. This property allows any\nchain in $\\mathbf{X}$ to hop between modes in the posterior\ndistributions of the parameters. To search for modes and allow their\ninclusion in the parameter distribution, the algorithm sets $\\gamma =\n1$ every ten iterations.\n\nThe DREAM(ZS) algorithm also employs a more complicated ''snooker''\nupdater that relies instead on three draws from $\\mathbf{Z}$. \n\\citet{terbraak08} demonstrated that the snooker updater\ncomplements the difference updater described above, arguably allowing a more\nefficient search of parameter space than would be provided by\ndifference steps alone. In our implementation, there is a 10\\% chance\nof a given iteration using snooker rather than difference updates.\n\nWe run $10^5$ iterations, which, taking into account three chains and\nten steps per interval, corresponds to $3\\times 10^6$ functional\nevaluations of the model.\nParameter distributions and summary statistics are derived from the\nfinal state of the history array $\\mathbf{Z}$. Since we initialize\n$\\mathbf{Z}$ using random draws from the parameter support regions,\nthe early values of $\\mathbf{Z}$ are drawn far from the equilibrium\nparameter distribution and represent expectedly poor fits to the\ndata. These initial ``burn-in'' values are identified based on an\nevaluation of $\\chi^2$ values, and they are discarded before analysis\nof the chains. Formally, we divide the $\\chi^2$ vector into 20 equal\nintervals. The boundary between non-equilibrium and equilibrium\nintervals is determined using the \\citet{geweke92} diagnostic to evaluate\nthe difference of means between a given interval and the final\ninterval.\n\n{{In our earlier {\\tt AMOEBA} analysis, we found that the uncertainties in our measured spectrum were systematically smaller than the residuals of the fit.  Adding in an additional $\\sim$10\\% uncertainty brings the residuals and uncertainties into reasonable agreement.  This discrepancy could be due to  underestimated uncertainties in our observed spectrum and/or systematic uncertainties in our telluric spectrum and the brown dwarf model atmospheres.  To account for the effect of these systematic uncertainties in the posterior distributions of our MCMC analysis, we include a uniform 10\\% systematic uncertainty\\footnote{Because {\\tt AMOEBA} does not propagate uncertainties, including a systematic 10\\% uncertainty reduces the $\\chi^2$ of our AMOEBA fits, but does not affect the best fit parameters.} which is added in quadrature to the measurement errors of our observed spectrum.}}\n\nOur spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ as well as the best fit model is displayed in Figure \\ref{fig:model_fit}.  {{The best fit model has {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}=1325$^{+330}_{-12}$~K and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}=3.7$^{+1.1}_{-0.1}$~dex.

Recently, revised age estimates indicate that the group is older.  \\citet{mamajek14} determined an age of $23 \\pm 3$~Myr by combining isochronal ages \\citep{mamajek14, malo14} and lithium depletion boundary ages \\citep{binks14, malo14}.  For a uniformly-distributed age of $23 \\pm 3$~Myr and a normally-distributed luminosity of $\\rm{log}(L_{bol}/L_{\\odot}) = -4.52\\pm0.04$~dex, we determine the mass, {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}, radius and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}\\ of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ using model isochrones (Table \\ref{tbl:mass}).  In general, the parameters determined from all four sets of models agree quite well.  The cloud-free evolutionary models (Ames-COND and \\citeauthor{saumon08} cloudless) yield slightly lower masses and smaller radii than models with clouds (Ames-DUSTY and \\citeauthor{saumon08} $f_{sed} = 2$).  {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ has incredibly red $J-K$ colors, indicating a very cloudy atmosphere \\citep{liu13}.  {{The Ames-DUSTY models are not recommended for use with objects having {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ cooler than 1700~K \\citep{allard01}.}}  Thus, we adopt the physical properties as determined by the \\citeauthor{saumon08} $f_{sed}=2$ models:  mass=$8.3\\pm0.5$~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}, {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}=$1127^{+24}_{-26}$~K, radius=$1.464^{+0.009}_{-0.008}$~{\\mbox{$R_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}, and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}=$4.01\\pm0.03$~dex. \n\n{{The {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ determined by forward-modeling our spectrum, 1325$^{+330}_{-12}$~K, is significantly higher than the {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ inferred by evolutionary models.  This discrepancy is similar to the result found by \\citet{liu13} using a much lower resolution spectrum spanning a larger wavelength range.  This hints that atmospheric models over-predict {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ when fitting either the broad-band spectral morphology seen in low-resolution spectra or the depths of spectral lines seen in high resolution spectra.}}\n\nThe mass we determine for {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is somewhat higher than the 6.5$^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}\\ reported by \\citet{liu13}.  This can be attributed to the revised (older) age of the {$\\beta$~Pic}\\ moving group. {{For comparison to {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, we calculate the properties of {$\\beta$~Pic}~b and 2M1207b (Table \\ref{tbl:mass}) using the \\citeauthor{saumon08} $f_{sed}=2$ evolutionary models and accounting for recent revisions to the ages of the {$\\beta$~Pic}\\ and TW~Hydra moving groups.}}  The mass of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ ($8.3\\pm0.5$~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}) is intermediate to the two known directly-imaged exoplanets around {$\\beta$~Pic}\\ members, {$\\beta$~Pic}~b and 51~Eri~b \\citep[$\\sim$2~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}};][]{macintosh15}.  {{In addition, {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is an excellent free-floating analog to {$\\beta$~Pic}~b and 2M1207b, the only other planetary-mass objects having constraints on their rotation.}}\n\n\\section{Constraining the Rotation and Inclination of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}}\nOur measurement of {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ = {{17.5$^{+2.3}_{-2.8}$~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}\\ }}allows us to constrain the equatorial velocity and inclination of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}.  \\citet{biller15} report the detection of $J_S$-band variability, likely due to rotational modulation of inhomogeneous cloud cover.  Unfortunately, the measurements of \\citet{biller15} do not cover a long enough time span to measure a full rotational period of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, but they constrain the period to $\\ge$5~hours.  Assuming a radius of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ of 1.464~{\\mbox{$R_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}, a period of $>$5~hours corresponds to an equatorial velocity of $<$36~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}.  {{Thus, our {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ measurement in combination with the \\citeauthor{biller15} result constrains the equatorial velocity to 17.5--36~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}} and the inclination of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ to $i \\ge 29^{\\circ}$.}}  In addition, our {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ measurement places an upper limit on the rotational period of {{10.2~hours}}.  A period of 5--10.2 hours is slightly longer than the typical $\\sim$3~hour periods of L/T transition field brown dwarfs \\citep{radigan14}, which is expected given that {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is young and still in the process of contracting.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{equatorial_v.eps}}\n\\caption[Equatorial Velocities]\n{\\label{fig:velocity} A variation on Figure 2 of \\citet{snellen14} comparing the equatorial velocities of planets and brown dwarfs.

The 10.7$^{+1.2}_{-0.8}$~hour period of 2M1207b \\citep{zhou15} is slighty longer than our upper limit on the period for {PSO~J318.5$-$22}.  Given 2M1207b's lower mass and younger age (see \\S 5), it is expected to rotate more slowly than {$\\beta$~Pic}~b and {PSO~J318.5$-$22}.  Indeed, the equatorial velocity of 2M1207b is 17.3$\\pm$1.5~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}} as calculated from its rotational period and evolutionary-model inferred radius.}}  The agreement in equatorial velocities for 2M1207b, {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ and {$\\beta$~Pic}~b hints that the angular momentum evolution of free-floating and gravitationally-bound planetary mass objects is similar.  For comparison, we calculate the equatorial velocities for field brown dwarfs with measured periods in \\citet{metchev15} and with estimated masses and radii from \\citet{filippazzo15}.  We find that field brown dwarfs have a relatively broad range of equatorial velocities $\\sim$6--80~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}.   {{Additional rotation measurements for planetary-mass objects are needed to determine if the field brown dwarf spread in equatorial velocity extends to lower masses.}}  Figure \\ref{fig:velocity} compares the equatorial velocity of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ to that of {$\\beta$~Pic}~b \\citep{snellen14}, planets in our solar system\\footnote{\\url{http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/}}, and field brown brown dwarfs.  Solar system planets have a log-log velocity-mass relationship.  2M1207b, {$\\beta$~Pic}~b and {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ are slower rotating than would be expected from the extrapolation of the solar system velocity-mass relationship.  This is likely due to their young ages.  By the time they are the age of our solar system, the equatorial velocities of 2M1207b, {$\\beta$~Pic}~b, and {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ should increase by a factor of $\\sim$1.5 as they contract to a radius of $\\sim$1~{\\mbox{$R_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}, putting them in good agreement with the velocity-mass relation seen for the solar system planets.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nUsing forward modeling techniques, we have measured the radial velocity ($-$6.0$^{+0.8}_{-1.1}$~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}) and {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ (17.5$^{+2.3}_{-2.8}$~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}) of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}.  Combining our $v_r$ with an updated parallax and proper motion of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, we determine its $UVW$ velocities.  We find that the galactic position and motion of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ are consistent with membership in the {$\\beta$~Pic}\\ moving group.  The luminosity of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, combined with recent age determinations of the {$\\beta$~Pic}\\ moving group allow us to use evolutionary models to estimate its mass, {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}, radius, and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}.  Using our {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ measurement and recently published variability results, we determine that the inclination of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ must be greater than $29^{\\circ}$ and the rotational period is constrained to 5--10.2~hours.

We present a high resolution $K$-band spectrum of PSO J318.5338$-$22.8603.  Using a forward-modeling Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, we report the first measurement of the radial velocity and {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, $-$6.0$^{+0.8}_{-1.1}$~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}\\ and 17.5$^{+2.3}_{-2.8}$~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}, respectively.  We calculate the space velocity and position of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ and confirm that it is a member of the $\\beta$~Pictoris moving group. Adopting an age of 23$\\pm$3~Myr for {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, we determine a mass of $8.3\\pm0.5$~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}\\ and effective temperature of $1127^{+24}_{-26}$~K using evolutionary models. {{PSO J318.5338$-$22.8603 is intermediate in mass and temperature to the directly-imaged planets $\\beta$~Pictoris~b and 51~Eridani~b, making it an important benchmark object in the sequence of planetary-mass members of the $\\beta$~Pictoris moving group.}}\nCombining our {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ measurement with recent photometric variability data, we constrain the inclination of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ to $>29^{\\circ}$ and its rotational period to 5--10.2~hours.  The equatorial velocity of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ indicates that its rotation is consistent with an extrapolation of the velocity-mass relationship for solar system planets.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{brown dwarfs -infrared:stars - planets and satellites: atmospheres - techniques: radial velocities - techniques: spectroscopic - stars: rotation}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nObjects with masses below the hydrogen burning limit \\citep[$\\sim$75~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}};][]{burrows01} cool as they age, resulting in a mass-age-luminosity degeneracy.  Several-Gyr-old brown dwarfs can have the same luminosities as much younger, several-Myr-old planetary-mass ($\\lesssim$13~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}) objects.  Thus, to determine the mass of a single substellar object, one must have an independent {{constraint on its}} age.\n\nAs planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs cool, they also contract, increasing their surface gravity as they evolve.  Thus evidence of low gravity ({e.g.}\\ weak FeH and alkali features, strong VO absorption) in a spectrum can {{corroborate}} the youth of an object.  As noted in \\citet{allers13}, however, spectroscopic ages are not particularly accurate, and objects of the same age and spectral type can have different indicators of youth.\n\n{{Another method to}} determine the age of a substellar object is via association with a young stellar moving group. \nThese groups have ages known from the stellar members of the groups, either from model isochrone fitting of the members on an HR diagram \\citep[{e.g.}][]{zuckerman01,pecaut12} or the location of the lithium depletion boundaries \\citep[{e.g.}][]{king00,binks14}.  Though the estimated age of an individual group may vary by up to a factor of $\\sim$2 depending on the method of age determination, the various methods agree on the relative ages of the groups \\citep[{e.g.}][]{mentuch08,dasilva09,bell15}.  In order to link an object to a local young moving group, its galactic kinematics ($UVW$) and position ($XYZ$) must agree with the other known members of the group.\n\nPSO J318.5338$-$22.8603 (hereinafter {PSO~J318.5$-$22}), discovered by \\citet{liu13}, is the first free-floating object with colors and luminosity that overlap the young, dusty, {{planetary-mass companions}} to HR~8799 and 2MASS~J1207-39.  Based on its parallax, proper motion, and spectroscopic signatures of youth (low-gravity), \\citeauthor{liu13} identified {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ as a candidate member of the $\\beta$~Pictoris (hereinafter {$\\beta$~Pic}) moving group.  \\citeauthor{liu13} estimate a mass of 6.5$^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$~{\\mbox{$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$}}\\ for {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, based on evolutionary models for an isochronal age of 12$^{+8}_{-4}$~Myr and the luminosity of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}.  Here, we report a determination of the radial and rotational velocities of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ for the first time and assess the probability that {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is a member of the {$\\beta$~Pic}\\ moving group.  We re-estimate the physical properties of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ based on recent determinations of the age of the {$\\beta$~Pic}\\ moving group \\citep[23$\\pm$3~Myr;][]{mamajek14}.  {{With a mass and effective temperature intermediate to the directly-imaged exoplanets $\\beta$~Pictoris~b \\citep{lagrange09} and 51~Eridani~b \\citep{macintosh15}, {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is an important free-floating analog to these young planets.}}  In addition, combining our measurement of {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ with the recent measurements of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}'s orbital period \\citep{biller15}, we constrain its spin axis inclination and equatorial velocity.\n\n\\section{Observations and Data Reduction}\n\nWe obtained a high resolution (R~$\\approx$~14000) spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\\nusing the GNIRS spectrograph \\citep{elias06} on the Gemini-North\nTelescope.  We used the 111~lines~mm$^{-1}$ grating with a 0.15''\nslit, resulting in a 2.27--2.33~$\\mu$m spectrum.  Our queue\nobservations were obtained on UT 26 November 2013 under clear skies\nwhile the seeing was 0.49''.  Seven exposures of 600~s were obtained,\nnodding 6\\arcsec\\ along the slit between exposures for a total integration\ntime of 70 minutes.  Immediately after our observations of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, we\nobtained flat field and Xenon-Argon lamp images.\nWe also observed an A0 star, HIP~110746, as a telluric standard using the same instrument\nsetup.  \n\nData were reduced using the {\\tt REDSPEC} reduction\npackage to spatially and spectrally rectify each exposure, referencing the Keck/NIRSPEC Echelle Arc Lamp Tool (\\url{http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirspec/N7arclamps.html}) to identify the wavelengths of lines in our arc lamp spectrum.\nAfter nod-subtracting pairs of exposures, we create a spatial profile which is the median intensity across all wavelengths at each position along the slit.  \nTo remove any residual sky emission lines from our nod-subtracted pairs and to determine the noise per pixel at each wavelength, we identify pixels in the spatial profile that do not contain significant source flux.  At each wavelength, we fit a line to the intensity of these background pixels vs.~position along the slit.  \nThe fitted line provides the background level as a function of position and the scatter of the background pixels about the line gives the noise per pixel.\\footnote{This assumes that the shot noise is dominated by the background.  {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is faint, so the sky background level is $>$3 times brighter than the flux of our source across all wavelengths of our spectrum.}\nWe then performed a\nprofile-weighted extraction \\citep{horne86} on each exposure and combined the resulting spectra\n using a robust weighted mean with the {\\tt xcombspec} procedure from the SpeXtool package\n\\citep{cushing04}.  The median signal-to-noise of our final spectrum is 21.\n\nWe determine the FWHM of the line spread function (LSF) by fitting 1-dimensional gaussians to the Xenon and Argon lines in an extracted spectrum of the arc lamp image.  For the seven arc lamp lines, we calculate a mean and standard deviation for the LSF~FWHM of of 0.000163$\\pm$0.000015~$\\mu$m, corresponding to a resolution, $R = \\lambda/ \\Delta \\lambda = 14100$.  \n\n\\section{Determining Radial and Rotational Velocities}\n\nUnfortunately, no radial velocity standard was observed as a part of\nour Gemini program.  We\nuse an approach similar to that described by \\citet{blake10},\nwherein we employ forward modeling to simultaneously fit the wavelength solution of our spectrum, the rotational and radial velocities of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, the scaling of telluric line depths, and the FWHM of the instrumental LSF.\n\n\\subsection{Creating a Forward Model}\nOur observed spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is the combination of the spectrum of the\nbrown dwarf, telluric absorption, and effects\nfrom the instrument (wavelength-dependent response and line spread functions).  We\ncreate myriad model spectra and evaluate the best fit parameters by comparison to our\nobserved spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}.  The components of our forward model are:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item{{\\bf Wavelength Solution:}\nWhen reducing our data, the wavelength solution of our observed spectrum is determined from seven Xenon-Argon arc lines with wavelengths of 2.29-2.33~$\\mu$m.  There are no arc lines for the 2.27--2.29 $\\mu$m portion of our spectrum.  In addition, the typical residuals to our wavelength solution for each arc line correspond to $\\sim$5~km~s$^{-1}$.  \nOur spectrum itself contains many telluric absorption features which allow us to refine the wavelength solution as a part of our forward modeling.\nWe calculate the wavelength solution of our observed spectrum using a\n2nd-degree polynomial.  Rather than having the coefficients of the\npolynomial as our fitted parameters, we use barycentric Lagrangian interpolation \\citep{berrut04, waring79}, solving for the wavelengths of the first,\nmiddle, and last pixels of the spectrum and determining the\ncoefficients of the unique 2nd-degree polynomial that will fit these three\npoints.  We start by adopting the wavelengths of our reduced spectrum as the initial guess.}  \n\n\\item{{\\bf Brown Dwarf Atmosphere Model:}\nWe use the BT-Settl model atmospheres \\citep{allard12} as the intrinsic\nspectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ in our forward modeling.  The BT-Settl models are provided for two different\nassumed solar abundances (Asplund et al. 2009 [AGSS] and Caffau et\nal. 2011 [CIFIST]).  We use model grids with effective\ntemperatures ({\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}) of 1100--2500~K and surface gravities ({\\mbox{log($g$)}}) of\n3.5--5.5~dex (where $g$ is in units of cm~s$^{-2}$.)   We adjust the wavelengths of the model atmosphere\nto account for the radial velocity of the object, $\\lambda =\n\\lambda_0 +( (v_r + v_{bary}) \\lambda_0/c)$, where $v_r$ is the radial velocity of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, and $v_{bary}$ (28.1 {\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}) is the barycentric motion projected away from {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ at the time of our observation.   \nWe then convolve the model spectrum to account for rotation, {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}, using a\nconvolution kernel created by the {\\tt LSF\\_ROTATE} task\\footnote{A part\nof the IDL Astronomy User's Library}.  Our velocity-shifted, rotationally broadened model atmosphere approximates the spectrum of the brown dwarf itself.}\n\n\\item{{\\bf Telluric Absorption:}\nWe use the telluric spectrum of\n\\citet{livingston91}\\footnote{available for download at\n  \\url{ftp://ftp.noao.edu/catalogs/atmospheric_transmission/transdata_1_5_mic.gz}}.\nWe adjust the\ndepths of the telluric features and create a new telluric spectrum, $T(\\lambda) =\nT_0(\\lambda)^\\tau$, where $T_0(\\lambda)$ is the\n\\citet{livingston91} spectrum, and $\\tau$ is one of the parameters of\nour fit.   The velocity-shifted, rotationally broadened brown dwarf model atmosphere is then multiplied by the telluric spectrum, approximating the spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ as it enters the telescope.}\n\n\\item{{\\bf Instrumental Effects:}\nWe approximate the instrumental LSF as a gaussian and fit for the FWHM of the\ngaussian convolution kernel.  We convolve the brown dwarf model atmosphere with telluric absorption by this gaussian kernel.  \nWe account for any changes in spectral shape between our model and the observed spectrum by taking the ratio of our observed spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ to\nour model spectrum, fitting the smoothed ratio with a 3rd order\npolynomial, multiplying our model by the fit, and then scaling our model to\nthe median of our observed spectrum.}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn total, our forward model has nine free parameters:  the {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}\\ of the atmospheric model, the $v_r$ and {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}, $\\tau$ for the telluric spectrum, the LSF FWHM, and the wavelengths of the first, middle and last pixels.  The forward model is compared to our observed spectrum, and the parameters used to create the forward model are adjusted to achieve the best fit.\n\n\\subsection{Parameter Optimization with AMOEBA}\n\n{\\tt AMOEBA} uses a downhill simplex method \\citep{nelder65} to find the minimum of a multivariate function.  We used IDL's implementation of {\\tt AMOEBA}, which is based on \\emph{Numerical Recipes in C} \\citep{numericalrecipes}.   We run our {\\tt AMOEBA} optimization for each model atmosphere having {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ = 900 - 2500~K and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}\\ = 3.5-5.5 in the CIFIST and AGSS grids.  {\\tt AMOEBA} does not conduct a thorough search of parameter space, so it is important to seed it with reasonable parameter estimates.  We initialize {\\tt AMOEBA} with $v_r$ = 0~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}\\ and {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ = 15~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}, typical of observed values of ultracool dwarfs \\citep{blake10}.  We use the FWHM of the LSF as determined from our arc lamp spectrum (\\S 2) as a starting point.  To get a starting point for $\\tau$, we divide our observed telluric standard spectrum by an LSF-convolved telluric absorption spectrum and find the value of $\\tau$ (0.7) that, by eye, results in a featureless spectrum (as expected for an A0 star from 2.27--2.33~$\\mu$m).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[angle=270, width=3.5in]{BTSettl_fits.ps}}\n\\caption[$\\chi^2$ for Various Atmospheric Models]\n{\\label{fig:amoeba_chi} {\\tt AMOEBA}'s best fit $\\chi^2$ using BT-Settl models.  The minimum $\\chi^2$ occurs for the CIFIST model with $T_{eff}$=1650~K and log($g$)=5.0.  In general, the CIFIST models provide marginally better fits than the AGSS09 models.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe find that the atmospheric model giving the best overall fit (minimum $\\chi^2$), is the CIFIST model having {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ = {{1650}}~K and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}\\ = {{5.0}}, in reasonable agreement with the temperature (1400--1600~K) and log(g) (4.0--4.5) of the atmospheric models which fit the low-resolution 0.8--2.5~$\\mu$m spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ \\citep{liu13}.  The best fit parameters returned for this model are: {{FWHM of LSF=0.000169~$\\mu$m, $\\tau$=0.868, {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}=11.6~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}, and $v_r$=-7.4~{\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}.}}\n\nOverall, the CIFIST models provide better fits than the AGSS models (Figure \\ref{fig:amoeba_chi}).  \nRegardless of the assumed solar abundance, {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}, or {\\mbox{log($g$)}}\\ of the atmospheric model, we find that {\\tt AMOEBA} converges on a radial velocity  {{of -7.4 to -2.3 {\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}\\ }}.  In contrast, the {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ that {\\tt AMOEBA} finds varies significantly (0 to 80 {\\mbox{km~s$^{-1}$}}) depending on the model used.  \nWe find that the fitted {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ and resulting $\\chi^2$ of the model fit are correlated.  For atmospheric models with fits having higher $\\chi^2$ values, {\\tt AMOEBA} converges on higher values of {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}.  From this analysis, it is unknown if the higher $\\chi^2$ values mean the {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ is genuinely low, or if for atmospheric models that do not approximate the spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ a higher {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ smears out the lines and results in a better fit.\n\nOur {\\tt AMOEBA} fitting provides a useful first estimate of the best fit parameters but {{lacks a straightforward way to determine their uncertainties}}.  In addition, the correlation between $\\chi^2$ and {\\mbox{$v$~sin($i$)}}\\ motivates a more sophisticated analysis to determine our best fit parameters and their associated uncertainties.\n\n\\subsection{Parameter Optimization with MCMC and DREAM(ZS)}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=3.8in]{PSO318.5-dreamZS-fsys-btsettl-3-0ModelFit.eps}}\n\\caption[Best Fit Model]\n{\\label{fig:model_fit} Our observed spectrum of {PSO~J318.5$-$22}\\ (black) compared to our the forward model with our best fit parameters (red).

We create forward models in the manner described above but in addition allow for a continuous distribution of {\\mbox{$T_{eff}$}}\\ and {\\mbox{log($g$)}}\\ by linearly interpolating between atmosphere models in the CIFIST grid. We\nemploy the DREAM(ZS) algorithm of \\citet{terbraak08}, which\ninvolves an adaptive stepper, updating model parameters based on chain\nhistories. A brief description of the algorithm follows. \n\nThree chains are run in parallel, and each chain is a history of\naccepted parameter vectors $\\mathbf{p}$. \nCurrent values of the 3 chain vectors are stored in the array $\\mathbf{X}$, and chain histories are stored in the array $\\mathbf{Z}$. \nTo simplify the notation,\n$\\mathbf{X}[i]$ refers to the $n$-dimensional, $i$-th parameter vector\ncurrently stored in $\\mathbf{X}$ (i.e., the $i$-th chain in\n$\\mathbf{X}$), and we adopt the same notation for the history array,\n$\\mathbf{Z}[i]$.  We initially seed each chain with the parameters of the best-fit model as determined by our {\\tt AMOEBA} analysis (\\S 3.2).\n\nAt each iteration and for each chain $\\mathbf{X}[i]$, two parameter\nvectors $\\mathbf{Z}[j]$ and $\\mathbf{Z}[k]$ are selected at random and\nwithout replacement from $\\mathbf{Z}$. A trial parameter vector,\n$\\mathbf{x}$, is then calculated by the difference,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{x}[i] = \\mathbf{X}[i] + (1 + \\mathbf{e}) \\gamma\n(\\mathbf{Z}[j] - \\mathbf{Z}[k]) + \\mathbf{\\epsilon},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathbf{x}[i]=\\mathbf{X}[i]+(1+\\mathbf{e})\\gamma(\\mathbf{Z}[j]-\\mathbf{Z}[k])+%&#10;\\mathbf{\\epsilon},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>i</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc17</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>i</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>\ud835\udc1e</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc19</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>j</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc19</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>\u03f5</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
