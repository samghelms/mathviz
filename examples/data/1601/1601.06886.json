It turned out that satisfactory agreement was confirmed \nin most cases ($\\sim 90$\\%, though appreciable discrepancies were\nseen for some stars such as higher-mass red-clump giants), \nsuggesting that recent stellar evolution calculations are practically reliable.\nSince the relevant stellar age could also be obtained by this \ncomparison, we derived the age--metallicity relation for these {\\it Kepler} \ngiants and found the following characteristics: (1) The resulting\ndistribution is quite similar to what was previously concluded \nfor FGK dwarfs. (2) The dispersion of metallicity progressively\nincreases as the age becomes older. (3) Nevertheless, the maximum \nmetallicity at any stellar age remains almost flat, which means\nthe existence of super/near-solar metallicity stars in a considerably\nwide age range from $\\sim$~(2--3)~$\\times 10^{8}$~yr to $\\sim 10^{10}$~yr.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\nGalaxy: evolution -- stars: atmospheres -- stars: evolution -- \nstars: late-type -- stars: oscillations\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThanks to the recent asteroseismological technique combined with very \nprecise photometric continuous observations from satellites such as {\\it Kepler}\nor {\\it CoRoT}, it has become possible to clearly discriminate the evolutionary \nstatus of red giants (shell H-burning phase before He-ignition or He-burning phase \nafter He-ignition; cf. Bedding et al. 2011) and to accurately determine \nthe stellar mass ($M$) as well as radius ($R$) by making use of the \nscaling relations (e.g., Pinsonneault et al. 2014, Casagrande et al. 2014,\nand references therein).\n\nFollowing this line, Takeda \\& Tajitsu (2015; hereinafter referred to \nas Paper~I) conducted our first study based on high-dispersion spectra of\n58 stars taken from Mosser et al.'s (2012) 218 sample of red giants in the {\\it Kepler}\nfield with asteroseismologically established parameters, where they spectroscopically \nderived four atmospheric parameters for these 58 giant stars: effective temperature \n($T_{\\rm eff}$), logarithmic surface gravity ($\\log g$), microturbulent velocity \n($v_{\\rm t}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]; logarithmic Fe abundance relative to the Sun). \nSince their main purpose was to assess the accuracy of \nthe stellar mass estimated from evolutionary tracks ($M_{\\rm trk}$) \nas well as of the spectroscopic gravity ($\\log g_{\\rm spec}$) \npreviously published by Takeda, Sato, \\& Murata (2008) for a large number of field \nGK giants, they compared such conventionally determined parameters\nof these {\\it Kepler} sample with the corresponding seismic ones, and arrived\nat the following conclusions: \\\\\n--- (i) A satisfactory agreement was confirmed between $\\log g_{\\rm spec}$ and \n$\\log g_{\\rm seis}$, which may suggest that Takeda et al.'s (2008) gravity results \nare well reliable.\\\\\n--- (ii) Meanwhile, Takeda et al.'s (2008) $M_{\\rm trk}$ values for He-burning \nred-clump (RC) giants must have been considerably (typically by $\\sim 50$\\%) overestimated \n(presumably due to the ignorance of evolutionary status along with the use of \nincomplete set of evolutionary tracks), though those of H-burning red giants (RG) \ndo not suffer such a problem.    \n\nNow that the compatibility as well as reliability of seismic and spectroscopic\nparameters has been confirmed, we can make use of them together in combination\nwith recent theoretically evolutionary tracks computed in very fine grids of\nstellar parameters (cf. Appendix A in Paper~I).\nThis situation provides us with a good opportunity to examine the consistency\nbetween the observed locations and theoretically computed evolutionary tracks of \ngiant stars in the Hertzsprung--Russell (HR) diagram (i.e., $\\log L$ vs. $\\log T_{\\rm eff}$ \nrelation). That is, seismic $R_{\\rm seis}$ and spectroscopic $T_{\\rm eff,spec}$ \nsuffice to define the location of each star on this diagram, while asteroseismologically\nestablished stellar mass ($M_{\\rm seis}$) and distinction of evolutionary status \n(RG or RC) [coupled with spectroscopically determined metallicity ([Fe/H]$_{\\rm spec}$)] \nare sufficient to assign an appropriate evolutionary track to each star. \n``Does the observed location on the $\\log L$--$\\log T_{\\rm eff}$ diagram\nwell matches the allocated evolutionary track?''\nWe thus decided to carry out this consistency check for a large number of {\\it Kepler} \ngiants, which have eventually added up to 106 stars (in combination with the previous \n58 stars in Paper~I) since we newly observed 48 stars for the present study.\nThis is the primary purpose of this paper.\n\nAn important by-product resulting from such comparison with theoretical tracks\nis the age, which is mainly determined by the stellar mass in the present\ncase of giant stars (see, e.g., Casagrande et al. 2016). Thanks to the reliably \nknown $M_{\\rm seis}$, we can expect fairly precise age-evaluation for each star, \nby which the age--metallicity relation for these {\\it Kepler} giant sample is \nfinally accomplished, since the metallicity ([Fe/H]$_{\\rm spec}$) is \nspectroscopically known. ``How can such established age--metallicity distribution \nfor giants be compared with that derived for dwarfs?''\nThis examination is another aim of this investigation.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nThe new observational data of 48 {\\it Kepler} giants (to be combined with the\nprevious 58 stars in Paper~I) and derivation of their spectroscopic parameters are\ndescribed in Sect.~3. We examine in Sect.~4 whether the location for each star \non the HR diagram is consistent with the assigned evolutionary track.\nThe age--metallicity relation resulting from comparison with theoretical tracks \nis presented and discussed in Sect.~4, followed by Sect.~5 where the conclusions \nare summarised.\n\nBesides, given that new data have been accumulated compared to the previous \ncase in Paper~I and up-to-date theoretical tracks have become available,\nwe revisited the subjects treated in Paper~I and found some new enlightening\nresults, which are described in supplementary Appendices~A (comparison of \nspectroscopic and seismic $\\log g$) and B (mass-determination \nfrom theoretical tracks).    \n\n\\section{Stellar parameters of new 48 Kepler giants}\n\n\\subsection{Observational data and spectroscopic parameter determination}\n\nOur new spectroscopic observations for 48 giants in the {\\it Kepler} field,\nwhich were selected from Mosser et al.'s (2012) list, were carried out \non 2015 July 3 (UT) by using Subaru/HDS and the data reduction was done \nby using IRAF in the same manner (i.e., with the same setting/procedure) \nas in Paper~I (cf. Sect.~2 therein for more details). The S/N ratios of\nthe resulting spectra (covering 5100--7800~$\\rm\\AA$) for these 48 stars \nturned out to be $\\sim 100$ on the average, being similar to (or slightly \nworse than) the previous case of 42 stars in Paper~I. \n\nThe atmospheric parameters ($T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, $v_{\\rm t}$, and [Fe/H]) \nwere determined by using the measured equivalent widths of Fe~{\\sc i} and\nFe~{\\sc ii} lines in the same way as in Paper~I (see Sect.~3.1 therein).\nAlso, the projected rotational velocity ($v_{\\rm e}\\sin i$) was evaluated by \nspectrum-fitting analysis applied to the 6080--6089~$\\rm\\AA$ region.\nThe final results for these 48 {\\it Kepler} giants are summarised in Table~1, \nwhere the data are arranged in the same manner as in Table~1 of Paper~I.  \nThe equivalent-width data of Fe~{\\sc i} and Fe~{\\sc ii} lines along with \nthe corresponding Fe abundances, and the detailed broadening/abundance results\nof the 6080--6089~$\\rm\\AA$ fitting are also presented as supplementary \nonline material (tableE1.dat and tableE2.dat). \nIn analogy with Paper~I,  Fig.~1 (Fe abundance vs. equivalent width), \nFig.~2 (Fe abundance vs. excitation potential), and Fig.~3 (spectrum-fitting\nin 6080--6089~$\\rm\\AA$) are presented here (each corresponding to\nFig.~4, Fig.~5, and Fig.~6 of Paper~I, respectively).\n\n\\subsection{Special treatment for KIC~7341231}\n\nAlthough the spectroscopic parameters of almost all newly observed stars were \nderived by exactly following the procedures of Paper~I as mentioned in Sect.~2.1, \nonly one star (KIC~7341231 = BD~+42~3187) was exceptional. Actually, this is \na very metal-poor ([Fe/H] = $-1.7$) subgiant of comparatively higher $T_{\\rm eff}$ \n($\\sim 5300$~K), belonging to the halo population characterized by considerably\nlarge heliocentric radial velocity ($V_{\\rm r}^{\\rm hel} = -270$~km~s$^{-1}$).\nBecause of its conspicuously low metallicity along with higher $T_{\\rm eff}$,\nthe metallic lines of this star are markedly weaker compared to other giants\n(cf. Fig.~3), which makes it neither possible to determine the atmospheric parameters \nbased on the adopted list of Fe~{\\sc i}/Fe~{\\sc ii} lines (Takeda et al. 2005),\nnor to accomplish a reliable fitting analysis\nin the 6080--6089~$\\rm\\AA$ region for $v_{\\rm e}\\sin i$ evaluation.\nAccordingly, we employed a different set of stronger Fe~{\\sc i}/Fe~{\\sc ii} \nlines (see ``tableE1p.dat'' presented as online material), which were used by \nTakeda et al. (2006) for their study of RR~Lyr stars, in order to derive \n$T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, $v_{\\rm t}$, and [Fe/H] of this star.\nSimilarly, its $v_{\\rm e}\\sin i$ derivation was done by fitting in the \n5200--5212~$\\rm\\AA$ region comprising strong lines of Cr~{\\sc i}, Fe~{\\sc i}, \nTi~{\\sc i} and Y~{\\sc i} (see the inset in Fig.~3). \n\n\\section{Comparison on the HR diagram}\n\n\\subsection{Location of each star}\n\nOur total sample consists of 106 stars (42 stars from 2014 September observation\nalong with 16 stars from Thygesen et al.'s data as described in Paper~I, and\n48 stars from 2015 July observation newly presented in this paper),\nalthough the essential net number reduces to 103 because of the overlapping\nof 3 stars in 2014 September and Thygesen et al. samples. Since all these stars\nare taken from Mosser et al. (2012), their seismic radius ($R_{\\rm seis}$) \nand mass ($M_{\\rm seis}$) as well as the evolutionary stage (RG or RC1 or RC2)\\footnote{\nRG denotes red giants in the shell-H-burning phase before He ignition,\nwhile RC indicates red-clump giants in the He-burning phase after He ignition, \nwhich are further classified into RC1 ($M<1.8$~M$_{\\odot}$) and RC2 ($M>1.8$~M$_{\\odot}$\naccording to the mass.} are already established.\nIn addition, spectroscopically determined effective temperature ($T_{\\rm eff,spec}$)\nand metallicity ([Fe/H]$_{\\rm spec}$) are available from our study.\n \nIn this paper, we use the term ``HR diagram'' indicating a plot where stellar \nlogarithmic effective temperature [$\\log T_{\\rm eff}$ ($\\equiv X$), where $T_{\\rm eff}$\nis expressed in K] and logarithmic luminosity [$\\log L/{\\rm L}_{\\odot}$ ($\\equiv Y$)] \nare taken as the abscissa and ordinate, respectively.\nWe can naturally define the location of each star on this diagram, since $T_{\\rm eff}$ \nis known and $L$ can be evaluated by the relation\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\log (L/{\\rm L}_{\\odot}) = 4 \\log (T_{\\rm eff,spec}/{\\rm T}_{{\\rm eff},\\odot}) \n                        +  2 \\log (R_{\\rm seis}/{\\rm R}_{\\odot}), \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\log(L/{\\rm L}_{\\odot})=4\\log(T_{\\rm eff,spec}/{\\rm T}_{{\\rm eff},\\odot})+2%&#10;\\log(R_{\\rm seis}/{\\rm R}_{\\odot}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">L</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>eff</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>spec</mi></mrow></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi><mrow><mi>eff</mi><mo>,</mo><mo>\u2299</mo></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>seis</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">R</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06886.tex", "nexttext": "  \nbecomes minimum.\\footnote{\nHere, an empirical weight factor of 10 is introduced for $X$ \nbecause of the practical reason to avoid inadequate solutions,\nwhich sometimes result without it (especially for stars around \nthe bottom of the ascending giant branch).

Table~2)\nand the $\\Delta Y$ vs. $\\Delta X$ plot is displayed in Fig.~8, \nfrom which the following consequences can be extracted.\\\\\n--- Generally, a reasonable consistency to a level of $\\Delta X \\la 0.01$~dex \n(i.e., $\\Delta T_{\\rm eff} \\la 100$~K) and $\\Delta Y \\la 0.1$~dex (i.e., $\\la 0.2$~mag \nin magnitude) is accomplished for a majority ($\\sim$~90\\%) of our targets,\nindicating reasonable reliability of recent stellar evolution calculations \nin the sense that theoretical tracks can satisfactorily reproduce \nthe observed positions of red giant stars on the HR diagram.\\\\\n--- However, appreciable discrepancies are sometimes seen especially in a group of \nRC2 stars (e.g., KIC 07581399, 07205067, 05307747, 05990753, 04902641, 09583430, \n09349632), the observed lumonosities of which are by $\\sim$~0.2--0.4~dex \nlower than the theoretically predicted red-clump luminosities (cf. \nthe corresponding panels in Fig.~7). A closer inspection in reference to Table~2\nrevealed that these stars have apparently higher mass values \n(2.5~${\\rm M}_{\\odot} \\la M \\la$~3.5~${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) even among\nRC2 stars (RC stars of $M > 1.8$~${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Actually, we can recognize \nfrom Fig.~4b that the luminosities of all RC2 stars (tiangles) tightly cluster \nat $\\log (L/{\\rm L}_{\\odot}) \\sim$~1.6--1.9 almost irrespective of their masses \n(1.8~${\\rm M}_{\\odot} \\la M \\la$~3.5~${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), which apparently \ncontradicts the theoretical RC2 tracks ($\\log L$ increases by $\\sim 0.5$~dex \nfor a mass change from $\\sim 2$~${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ to $\\sim 3$~${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$).\nWe can not find any reasonable explanation for this inconsistency\nseen in higher-mass RC2 stars; it may be worthwhile to reexamine whether \ntheir assigned evolutionary tracks as well as $M$ and/or $R$ determination \nprocedures are really valid.\\\\\n--- Regarding RC1 and RG stars, the agreement is satisfactory in most cases, \nexcepting that appreciable differences are seen in several stars;\ne.g., KIC~05795626 for RC1, KIC~11717120, 07341231, and 08493735 for RG\n(note that these RG stars are not so much on the ascending track of \nred-giants as rather subgiants). We also notice a tendency of weak (positive) \ncorrelation between $\\Delta \\log L$ and $\\Delta \\log T_{\\rm eff}$ (cf. Fig.~8).\n\n\\section{Age--metallicity relation of giants}\n\n\\subsection{Derivation of age}\n\nAs a natural by-product of determining the proximate point on the track \n($X^{*}_{\\rm track}$, $Y^{*}_{\\rm track}$) described in Sect.~3.3, we \ncan derive the stellar age as the corresponding $t$ value ($t^{*}$).\nNote, however, that the age is mainly determined by the stellar mass \nin the present case of giant stars (see, e.g., Fig.~3c in Takeda et al. 2008), \nsince it restricts the predominantly long lifetime on the main sequence, \ncompared to which the period of post-main-sequence phase is insignificant. \nSo, pinpointing the location on the giant track is not necessarily very \nimportant in this respect. In order to clarify this situation, the elapsed \ntimes at the track points of several critical evolutionary phases\nas well as the corresponding fraction of main-sequence period are plotted \nagainst the stellar mass in Fig.~9, where we can see that these giants have \nspent a major fraction ($\\sim$~60--90\\%) of their past life on the main sequence. \n\nIn order to maintain the consistency with the previous work,\\footnote{\nWhile zero-age main-sequence was usually adopted as the origin of age \nin many old calculations, computations are done from the pre-main sequence phase \nin the PARSEC tracks we adopted.} \nwe define ``$age$'' as the time elapsed from the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS)\nas $age \\equiv t^{*} - t({\\rm ZAMS})$. Such derived $age$ values are given in Table~2. \n\n\\subsection{Result and implication}\n\nThe resulting $age$ vs. [Fe/H] distribution for our 106 {\\it Kepler} giants \nis depicted in  Fig.~10a, and the comparison with the relation derived \nfor field FGK dwarfs (Takeda 2007) is shown in Fig.~10b.\nWe can recognize from Fig.~10b that both results of giants and dwarfs\nare quite consistent with each other, without any systematic discrepancy\nsuch as that Takeda et al. (2008) once claimed (which is evidently due to \nerroneous overestimation of mass for many giants as pointed out in Paper~I). \n\nRegarding the observational study of galactic age--metallicity relation, \nnot a few papers have been published so far (see, e.g., Sect.~1 of \nBergemann et al. 2014 and the references therein). Although any consensus\nhas not yet been accomplished concerning the detailed characteristics,\nit is no doubt that the metallicity at a given age is by no means single-valued\nbut more or less diversified. Our result implies that the [Fe/H] dispersion\ntends to progressively increase with $age$ (from several $\\times 10^{8}$~yr \nto $\\sim 10^{10}$~yr) while the maximum metallicity does not change much\n(i.e., near/super-solar level is retained over this large span of $age$), \nresulting in a ``right triangle-like'' shape.\n\nEspecially, the existence of very old ($age$ $\\sim 10^{10}$~yr) metal-rich \n($0.0 \\la$~[Fe/H]~$\\la 0.4$) stars may be regarded as a significant consequence.\nHow should we interpret their origin? Were they born in the galactic bulge\nand migrated to the present position over the long passage of time?\nFrom this point of view, it would be interesting and worthwhile to study \nthe chemical abundances of key elements (e.g., $\\alpha$-group) of these old \nstars of high metallicity and to compare them with those of younger meta-rich stars.      \n\n\\section{Summary and conclusion}\n\nRecent very high-precision photometric observations from satellites \nhave enabled discrimination of the evolutionary status (RG/RC1/RC2) \nas well as determinations of $M$ and $R$ for a large number of \nred giant stars by exploiting the asteroseimological technique.  \n\nFollowing the same manner in Paper~I where our first pilot study was done for 58 stars,\nwe determined in this study the atmospheric parameters ($T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, \n$v_{\\rm t}$, and [Fe/H]) for additional 48 giants in the {\\it Kepler} field \nby using Fe~{\\sc i} and Fe~{\\sc ii} lines.\n\nGiven that spectroscopic and seismic information is now available for these \n106 red giants in total, we could readily define the position on the \n$\\log L$ vs. $\\log T_{\\rm eff}$ diagram and to assign an appropriate \ntheoretical evolutionary track to each star. \n\nOur first aim was to examine whether the observed stellar location \non this diagram really matches the assigned theoretical track.\nWe could confirm that the assigned track is mostly consistent with \nthe actual position (to a level of $\\la 100$~K in $T_{\\rm eff}$ and \n$\\la 0.2$~mag in $M_{\\rm bol}$) for a majority ($\\sim 90$\\%) of our targets. \nAccordingly, we may state that recent stellar evolution calculations \nare reasonably reliable. \n\nHowever, appreciable inconsistencies are seen for $\\sim 10$\\%\nof the sample stars. Especially noteworthy is that the luminosities of \nseveral RC2 stars with higher-$M$ (2.5~${\\rm M}_{\\odot} \\la M \\la$~3.5~${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$)\ndo not agree with the corresponding theorerical tracks, because they\ntend to tightly cluster at $\\log (L/{\\rm L}_{\\odot}) \\sim$~1.6--1.9 \nirrespective of their masses, which apparently contradicts the theoretical \nprediction. It may be worthwhile to reexamine the validity of assigned \nevolutionary tracks and of the $M$ as well as $R$ values for these stars.\n\nOur second purpose was to establish the age--metallicity relation\nbased on these giant stars, since the stellar age could be as a natural \nby-product of location--track comparison on the HR diagram.\nThe resulting distribution for giants turned out to be in good agreement\nwith that for FGK dwarfs derived by Takeda (2007), which is characterized\nby growing metallicity dispersion with an increase in age while\nthe maximum metallicity remains almost flat at the near/super-solar level\nover the wide age range from $\\sim$~(2--3)~$\\times 10^{8}$~yr to $\\sim 10^{10}$~yr.\n\nThe fact that very old ($age$ $\\sim 10^{10}$~yr) metal-rich ($0.0 \\la$~[Fe/H]~$\\la 0.4$) \nstars do exist may be regarded as a significant consequence from the viewpoint\nof galactic chemical evolution. Studying the chemical abundance characteristics\nof these stars in detail would be worthwhile toward clarifying their origin. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis research has been carried our by using the SIMBAD database,\noperated by CDS, Strasbourg, France. \n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\\bibitem[]{}\n  Asplund M., Grevesse N., Sauval A.

Now that the sample size\nhas been almost doubled, it would be worthwhile to recheck this matter again.\nThe correlation between $\\log g_{\\rm spec}$ and $\\log g_{\\rm seis}$ is \nshown in Fig.~A1a, while the $\\Delta\\log g$(spec$-$seis) difference is plotted \nagainst $T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, and [Fe/H] in Fig.~A1b, A1c, and A1d, respectively.\nWe can confirm from these figures the same characteristics as concluded in Paper~I; \ni.e., (i) $\\log g_{\\rm spec}$ and $\\log g_{\\rm seis}$ satisfactorily agree with \neach other (with the standard deviation of $\\sigma \\sim 0.1$~dex) and (ii) \n$\\Delta\\log g$(spec$-$seis) difference does not show any systematic dependence \nupon $T_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\log g$.  \n\nWe also point out that this conclusion for $\\Delta\\log g$(spec$-$seis) holds\nregardless of the evolutionary status (RG/RC1/RC2). Although Pinsonneault et al. \n(2014) recently carried out an extensive analysis on the stellar parameters of\na large number of red giants in the {\\it Kepler} field and reported\na systematic disagreement in $\\Delta\\log g$(spec$-$seis) between RG and RC1/RC2\n(i.e., negative for the former while positive for the latter; cf. Fig.~3\nof their paper), such a trend can not be observed in our results. \n\nInterestingly, however, we newly noticed a slight metallicity-dependent trend in \n$\\Delta\\log g$(spec$-$seis), in the sense that $\\Delta\\log g$(spec$-$seis) \ntends to increase with a decrease in [Fe/H], as shown in Fig.~A1d.\nIt is hard to consider that such a [Fe/H]-dependence exists in spectroscopic \ngravities for the following reasons:\\\\\n--- The difference in the metallicity for each star, which affects the opacity,\nis properly taken into account in model atmospheres in our analysis.\\\\\n--- It is unlikely that the non-LTE effect (non-LTE overionization of Fe~{\\sc i})\nis responsible, because it should lead to an {\\it underestimation} of \n$\\log g_{\\rm spec}$ which becomes more conspicuous as the metallicity \nis lowered. That is, if this effect appreciably exists, $\\Delta\\log g$(spec$-$seis) \nwould decrease with a decrease in [Fe/H], which is just the opposite to the trend \nseen in Fig.~A1d.\n\nWe, therefore, suspect that this effect may be attributed to $\\log g_{\\rm seis}$.\nHere, the scaling relation for $\\nu_{\\rm max} (\\propto g T_{\\rm eff}^{-1/2})$ \nis relevant (while $\\Delta \\nu$ is irrelevant) in deriving $g_{\\rm seis}$ \n(cf. Eq.(3) in Paper~I). However, this relation for $\\nu_{\\rm max}$, which was first \nproposed  by Kjeldsen \\& Bedding (1995) in analogy with acoustic cut-off frequency,\nis not so much physically justified as rather an empirically useful relation\n(e.g., Bedding \\& Kjeldsen 2003). Actually, Belkacem et al. (2013) discussed\nbased on their model calculation that this relation seems sufficiently good \nfor dwarfs but some discrepancies (by up to $\\sim 15$\\%) may arise for giants. \nAccordingly, given that there is still room for further improvement for the expression\nof $\\nu_{\\rm max}$, it may possibly depend upon the metallicity in some way. \n\n\n\\setcounter{figure}{0}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{minipage}{120mm}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=12.0cm]{figA1.eps}\n\\caption{\n(a) Comparison between spectroscopic $\\log g_{\\rm spec}$ and \nseismic $\\log g_{\\rm seis}$ for 106 stars based the combined results \nof Paper~I and this study.

Fig.~12a therein),\nwhich means that the mass values of many red clump giants in \nTakeda et al.'s (2008) sample must also be systematically too large.\n\nUnfortunately, in Paper~I, the direct $M_{\\rm seis}$ vs. $M_{\\rm trk}$ was \npossible only for 9 {\\it Kepler} giants (1 for RG, 6 for RC1, and 2 for RC2), \nbecause $L$ was determined from the apparent magnitude in the same manner \nas in Takeda et al. (2008) while the parallax data were available \nonly for a limited number of stars.  \nSince we have established this time the $L$ values for all 106 stars \nby combining $T_{\\rm eff,spec}$ and $R_{\\rm seis}$, we decided to\nrevisit this problem based on this large sample.   \n\nIn this test, we derived $M_{\\rm trk}$ in three different ways:\\\\\n--- (a) Exactly the same procedure as adopted by Takeda et al. (2008) \nwas followed; i.e., combined RG+RC tracks of Lejeune \\& Schaerer's (2001) grid \nfor various mass values were used as if neither the mass nor \nthe evolutionary status of each star were known (see Sect.~4.2 in Paper~I\nfor more details).\\\\\n--- (b) Combined RG+RC tracks of the PARSEC grid (for various mass values \nbut with the assigned $z_{\\rm grid}$ closest to actual stellar metallicity) \nwere used as if neither the mass nor the evolutionary status of each \nstar were known. That is, $M_{\\rm trk}$ was determined by searching for the minimum \n$d^{2}$ on the $(M,t)$ plane after trying all possible RG+RC tracks.\\\\\n--- (c) Either RG or RC tracks of the PARSEC grid (for various mass values \nbut with the assigned $z_{\\rm grid}$ closest to actual stellar metallicity) \nwere appropriately used depending on the known evolutionary status of each star.\nThat is, $M_{\\rm trk}$ was determined by searching for the minimum \n$d^{2}$ on the $(M,t)$ plane after trying all possible RG tracks (for RG class)\nor RC tracks (for RC1 or RC2 classes).\n\nThe resulting $M_{\\rm trk}$ vs. $M_{\\rm seis}$ plots corresponding to these\nthree cases are depicted in Fig.~B1a, Fig.~B1b, and Fig.~B1c, respectively.\nWe can see that Fig.~B1a is quite consistent with Fig.~12a in Paper~I,\nindicating a considerable overestimation of $M_{\\rm trk}$ for RC1 stars \n(red clump stars of lower mass), while the discrepancy is not\nso large for RC2 stars (red clump stars of higher mass) where\n$M_{\\rm trk}$ tends to be even somewhat smaller than $M_{\\rm seis}$\nat the high-mass end ($M \\ga 3 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$).\nWe suspect that the reason why the considerably large overestimation \nof $M_{\\rm trk}$ derived by Takeda et al.'s (2008) procedure is seen \nonly in RC1 stars (but not in RC2 stars) is mainly due to the lack \nof ``He flash'' RC tracks for lower mass stars ($M <2$~M$_{\\odot}$) \nin Lejeune \\& Schaere's (2001) data (cf. Fig.~A1d in Paper~I), \nrather than the ignorance of the evolutionary status. \nActually, we can recognize from the comparison of Fig.~B1b and Fig.~B1c\nthat the degree of consistency between $M_{\\rm trk}$ and $M_{\\rm seis}$\nis nearly the same for both case (b) [combined RG+RC tracks were indifferently \nused] and case (c) [either RG or RC tracks were appropriately assigned]. \nThis may suggest that the knowledge of the evolutionary status (RG or RC) \nin advance is not necessarily essential for deriving $M_{\\rm trk}$ \n(in the sense that such information does not significantly improve \nthe situation), for which sufficiently fine and wide coverage of \nthe ($z$, $M$) grid in the adopted theoretical tracks (as well as\ndefining the stellar position on the HR diagram as precisely as possible) \nwould be more important.  \n\n\n\\setcounter{figure}{0}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{minipage}{60mm}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6.0cm]{figB1.eps}\n\\caption{\nComparison of asteroseismologically determined massses ($M_{\\rm seis}$)\nfor 106 {\\it Kepler} giants with those estimated from evolutionary tracks \n($M_{\\rm trk}$), where three different kinds of tracks were tried. \n(a) Combined RG+RC tracks of Lejeune \\& Schaerer's (2001) data\nwere used as if the evolutionary status of each star were unknown,\njust as was done by Takeda et al.

These tracks are provided with very fine grids in terms of $z$ \n(metallicity defined as the mass fraction of heavy elements) and $M$ (initial mass);\ni.e.,  $z_{\\rm grid}$ = {0.06, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02, 0.017, 0.014, 0.01, 0.008, 0.006, \n0.004, 0.002, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, and 0.0001}, while the mesh of $M_{\\rm grid}$ \nis 0.05~M$_{\\odot}$ step (for 1--2.3~M$_{\\odot}$) or 0.1~M$_{\\odot}$ step \n(for 2.3--5~M$_{\\odot}$). Since these parameter grids are sufficiently fine, \nwe assign to each star the track corresponding to\n($z_{\\rm grid}$, $M_{\\rm grid}$) being nearest to the actual \n($z_{\\rm star}$, $M_{\\rm star}$), where $M_{\\rm star} \\equiv M_{\\rm seis}$\nand $z_{\\rm star} \\equiv 0.014 \\times 10^{\\rm [Fe/H]_{spec}}$\n(z$_{\\odot} = 0.014$ is the solar value; cf. Asplund et al. 2009). \nThe actual ($z_{\\rm star}$, $M_{\\rm star}$) as well as the adopted \n($z_{\\rm grid}$, $M_{\\rm grid}$) for each star are presented in Table~2.\nSince the evolutionary stage is known for all the targets,  we naturally allocate \n``RG tracks'' (track portion from the point of ``end of core H-burning'' through \nthe point of ``He ignition'') to RG-class stars, and ``RC tracks'' (track portion from \nthe point of ``He ignition'' through the point of ``asymptotic giant branch tip'')\\footnote{\nNote that, in the PARSEC database, post-He-ignition tracks for \n$M \\la 1.7$~M$_{\\odot}$ (where He burning begins violently as ``He flash'' \nfor this case of degenerated He core) are provided as independent data files \nlabeled as ``HB'' (Horizontal Branch).} \nto RC1/RC2-class stars.\n\n\\subsection{Matching check}\n\nComparison of the position on the HR diagram with the assigned track for each star \nis graphically depicted in Fig.~5 (RG stars), Fig.~6 (RC1 stars), and Fig.~7 (RC2 stars).\nWe indicate in each panel the ``proximate point'' ($X^{*}_{\\rm track}$, $Y^{*}_{\\rm track}$) \non the track by a Greek cross,\nwhere the distance-measure $d^{2}(t)$ ($t$ is the age variable of a track) defined by\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nd^{2}(t) \\equiv [(10 X_{\\rm star} - 10 X_{\\rm track}(t)]^{2} + [(Y_{\\rm star} - Y_{\\rm track}(t)]^{2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"d^{2}(t)\\equiv[(10X_{\\rm star}-10X_{\\rm track}(t)]^{2}+[(Y_{\\rm star}-Y_{\\rm&#10;track%&#10;}(t)]^{2}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msup><mi>d</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>10</mn><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>star</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mn>10</mn><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>track</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>Y</mi><mi>star</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>Y</mi><mi>track</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
