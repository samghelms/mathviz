We implicitly assume that the other fields play no r\\^ole in the semiclassical limit (for example, that there is no instability leading to condensation of some scalar), though the full bulk field contents are relevant at first subleading order in $c$, contributing to the one-loop determinant.}, at large central charge. In the semi-classical saddle point approximation we consider, the partition function will be given by the action $I$ of the dominant bulk classical solution, that is, the one of least action: ${\\mathcal{Z}} \\approx e^{-I}$. As we change the moduli of the Riemann surface, the dominant bulk saddle can change, leading to first order transitions between different phases of the partition function. We compute the leading order part ($\\propto c$) of the action; the order $c^0$ part can be computed from a bulk one-loop determinant \\cite{Giombi:2008vd,David:2009xg}, it is sometimes possible to go to higher order in $c$ \\cite{Chen:2013kpa,Chen:2013dxa,Headrick:2015gba}, and subdominant saddle points are expected to provide instanton contributions as in the genus one case \\cite{Dijkgraaf:2000fq,Manschot:2007ha,Witten:2007kt,Maloney:2007ud,Keller:2014xba}, but we will say no more about such quantum corrections here.\n\nIn this section we collect the preliminary information we require. We first explain the Schottky representation of ${X}$ we use, describe how the choice of metric on ${X}$ enters the calculation, and review the construction of bulk solutions and computation of their action.\n\n\\subsection{Schottky representation of ${X}$} \n\nThe virtue of pure three-dimensional gravity that makes our calculation tractable is that it is a locally trivial theory. This means that all Euclidean classical solutions can be constructed from quotients of Euclidean $AdS_3$, that is hyperbolic space ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$, by some subset of the isometry group\\footnote{Some non-handlebody solutions come from the index two extension including orientation reversing elements.} $PSL(2,{\\mathbb{C}})$. The boundary of ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$ is the Riemann sphere ${\\mathbb{P}}^1$, appearing as the complex plane if we adopt the upper-half space representation of ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$. The bulk isometries act on this boundary by M\\\"obius maps $w \\mapsto \\frac{aw +b}{cw + d}$. Thus, when we consider bulk solutions with boundary ${X}$, the Riemann surface ${X}$ will appear as a quotient of the Riemann sphere ${\\mathbb{P}}^1$. This is a Schottky uniformisation of ${X}$, which we now review. \n\nConsider $2g$ nonintersecting simple closed curves, usually circles,\\footnote{If the curves can be taken to be circles, $G$ (a group to be defined shortly) will be a classical Schottky group. There exist nonclassical Schottky groups for which this is impossible, but all of the examples we consider will be classical.} $C_i,C_i'$ for $i=1,\\ldots,g$ on the Riemann sphere, so that each curve divides the sphere into an `inside' and `outside', and each curve lies to the `outside' of all others.  Let the M\\\"obius maps $L_i$ map the interior of $C_i$ exactly into the exterior of $C_i'$. Each of the $L_i$ has repulsive and attractive fixed points $r_i$ and $a_i$, lying inside $C_i$ and $C_i'$ respectively. For a given $L_i$, these points may be mapped by conjugation to infinity and zero, after which $L_i$ is represented by a scale and rotation $w\\mapsto q_i^2 w$, for some $q_i$ with $0<|q_i|<1$. This means that these $L_i$ are loxodromic elements of $PSL(2,{\\mathbb{C}})$ (as opposed to elliptic, for which $|q|=1$, or parabolic, for which the fixed points coincide).\n\nThe group $G$ generated by the $L_i$ is a Schottky group. The set of all the $a_i,r_i,q_i^2$ can be used to parameterise the space of possible Schottky groups. After using the overall $SL(2,{\\mathbb{C}})$ to normalise the group to some convention, say by setting $a_1=0,r_1=\\infty,a_2=1$, the set of all parameters for which the $L_i$ generate a Schottky group is a domain in ${\\mathbb{C}}^{3g-3}$, known as Schottky space, in one-to-one correspondence with (normalised) marked Schottky groups, that is to say Schottky groups with a distinguished set of generators $L_1,\\ldots,L_g$.\n\nAfter we have removed the closure of the set of fixed points of $G$, to leave the `domain of discontinuity' $\\Omega(G)\\subset{\\mathbb{P}}^1$, we may take the quotient by $G$. A fundamental domain for this quotient is the region $D$ exterior to all the $C_i,C_i'$, which is a sphere with $2g$ holes cut out. The action of the quotient is to identify the circles bounding $D$ in pairs $C_i,C_i'$ by $L_i$, and each such identification acts to add a handle, resulting in a surface of genus $g$. The complex structure is inherited from that of ${\\mathbb{P}}^1$, since the M\\\"obius maps are conformal automorphisms.\n\nEvery Riemann surface can be obtained in this way, as a quotient ${X}=G\\backslash\\Omega(G)$. In fact, there are many ways to do this: picking a canonical basis $\\alpha_i,\\beta_i$, $i=1,\\ldots,g$ with $\\prod_i [\\alpha_i,\\beta_i]=1$ for the fundamental group of ${X}$, there is a marked Schottky group with ${X}=G\\backslash\\Omega(G)$, where the image of $C_i$ is freely homotopic to $\\alpha_i$, and some curve between $C_i$ and $C_i'$ is homotopic to $\\beta_i$. Roughly speaking, the $\\alpha_i$ are a choice of $g$ cycles to cut along to get a sphere with $2g$ holes. The set of possible Schottky groups uniformising ${X}$ is in correspondence with the possible normal subgroups generated by $\\alpha_i$ and their conjugates, $\\mathcal{N}\\langle\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_g\\rangle$. In the context of the handlebody geometries we will describe shortly, this subgroup has a geometric interpretation, as the set of cycles that are contractible in the bulk.\n\nAt genus 1, every Schottky group is conjugate to $\\{w\\mapsto q^{2n}w :n\\in{\\mathbb{Z}}\\}$ for some $q$, which we can write as $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$ for $\\tau$ in the upper half plane; then the Schottky representation is related to the more familiar description of the torus, as the plane modulo a lattice ${\\mathbb{C}}/\\langle 1,\\tau\\rangle$, by an exponential map $w=\\exp(2\\pi i z)$. Taking $\\tau\\mapsto\\tau+1$ leaves $q^2$ unchanged, so does not alter the Schottky group. General modular transformations $\\tau\\mapsto \\frac{a\\tau+b}{c\\tau+d}$ in $PSL(2,{\\mathbb{Z}})$ give a torus with the same complex structure, but a different Schottky group, corresponding to a choice of $\\alpha$ as a primitive cycle on the torus, which goes from the origin of the $z$-plane to $m+n\\tau$ for some coprime integers $m,n$.\n\nWith the exception of the torus, it is a hard problem to identify when two different Schottky groups give Riemann surfaces with the same complex structure. A crucial part of our calculation is to solve this `moduli matching' problem numerically.\n\n\n\\subsection{The boundary metric}\n\\label{bmetric}\n\nIn two dimensions the partition function of a CFT depends not just on the conformal structure, but also on the metric itself, through the Weyl anomaly.

The presence of an infinite-dimensional conformal symmetry on the field theory and the simplicity of gravity in three dimensions make it possible to carry out calculations that are inaccessible in higher dimensions. Due to the equivalence of conformal structure in two dimensions and complex structure, it is natural to study a CFT on a Riemann surface, and the simplest quantity to compute is the path integral on the surface, which defines the partition function. For the torus and higher genus surfaces, there is a nontrivial (though finite dimensional) moduli space, and one interesting avenue of investigation is the study of the dependence of the partition function on the moduli. For a holographic CFT in the semiclassical limit, this is computed by the action of a geometry solving the equations of motion, which for pure gravity is a hyperbolic three-manifold with the given surface as its asymptotic boundary, due to the local triviality of Einstein's equations in three dimensions. For a given Riemann surface on the boundary, there are many possible on-shell geometries which can contribute as saddle points to the partition function, including handlebody solutions, as well as non-handlebodies. As the moduli vary, there are phase transitions in the partition function where bulk saddle-points exchange dominance, generalising the Hawking-Page transition.\n\nFor the torus, this problem has been extensively explored, and the full partition function can be related to a sum over geometries, related by the modular group \\cite{Dijkgraaf:2000fq,Manschot:2007ha,Witten:2007kt,Maloney:2007ud,Keller:2014xba}. The situation for higher genus Riemann surfaces has been less thoroughly explored, although the first steps were taken more than a decade ago \\cite{Krasnov:2000zq,Krasnov:2003ye}. The main barrier to progress in the higher genus case was that although \\cite{Krasnov:2000zq} reduced the evaluation of the action for a bulk handlebody saddle-point to the calculation of a certain Liouville action on the boundary (using previous work by \\cite{TZ}), the explicit form of the Liouville field for a given surface remained unknown. These explicit fields and their actions are required to determine the phase structure of dominant bulk saddles as a function of the boundary moduli. In this paper we complete this programme by calculating the Liouville field numerically.\n\nWe will also compare the action for the handlebody solutions constructed in this way to the action for a class of non-handlebodies obtained as a quotient of a Euclidean wormhole with two Riemann surface boundaries.  The action for these non-handlebodies can be easily calculated analytically. \n\nRecently, these higher genus partition functions have seen renewed interest from two different points of view. The states defined by integrating over half of a higher genus surface have been studied by \\cite{Balasubramanian:2014hda,Maxfield:2014kra,Marolf:2015vma} (following \\cite{Skenderis:2009ju}) as examples of systems with interesting entanglement structure. The slice where we cut the surface in half has several disconnected components, so the state lives in several copies of the Hilbert space of a CFT on a circle, and its entanglement can be related to connectedness of the bulk solution, extending the basic relation between the thermofield double state and eternal black holes \\cite{Maldacena:2001kr}.

The construction of ${X}$ in terms of a quotient by a Schottky group was adopted because it provides a simple representation of the handlebody solutions in the bulk. The M\\\"obius maps on the boundary sphere have an extension into the ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$, where they act as orientation-preserving isometries. The loxodromic maps act without fixed points in the bulk, which means that ${\\mathcal{M}} = G\\backslash {\\mathbb{H}}^3$ is a smooth hyperbolic manifold, with boundary ${X}$.\n\nIn the case that the fundamental domain $D$ on the boundary is bounded by circles, there is a simple extension to a bulk fundamental domain, the region between the $2g$ hemispheres ending on the circles $C_i$, $C_i'$ in the Poincar\\'e half-space model of ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$. The quotient then identifies these hemispheres in pairs, just as it identified the circles on the boundary. From this it is easy to see that the cycles $\\alpha_i$ which are the images of $C_i$ are contractible in the bulk, while the cycles $\\beta_i$ which are the image of curves from $C_i$ to $C_i'$ remain non-contractible. These $g$ noncontractible cycles generate the fundamental group of the bulk, which is free on $g$ generators; in fact, $\\pi_1({\\mathcal{M}})$ is naturally isomorphic to the Schottky group $G$ itself.\n\nEach free homotopy class of closed curves curves has a unique geodesic representative, the lengths of which enter the calculation of entropies of subsets of boundaries, and which often have physical interpretations as horizons. It is therefore useful to relate the parameters of the Schottky generators to these bulk geodesic lengths.

To illustrate our numerical methods, we will explictly compute $\\phi$ for a simple family of genus two surfaces: we consider a two real-dimensional subspace of the full three complex-dimensional moduli space of genus two surfaces. This is a subspace of the three real-dimensional space of surfaces with a reflection symmetry considered in \\cite{Balasubramanian:2014hda}, describing multiboundary wormholes. This same subspace also arises as a subspace of the set of genus two surfaces which can be interpreted as states with a single boundary. In addition to the physical interest of these interpetations, the symmetry of ${X}$ in this subspace allows us to restrict consideration to bulk saddle points which preserve this symmetry, so we will be able to completely map out the relevant phases. In this section, we describe this subspace in more detail, and identify the bulk saddle points which preserve the symmetry and explain their physical interpretations.\n\n\\subsection{Reflection symmetric surfaces}\n\nWe first restrict to a class of Riemann surfaces with a reflection symmetry. Mathematically, this can be described as a \\emph{real structure}, which is a notion of complex conjugation on the surface. This is defined as an involutive anticonformal automorphism $\\sigma$. Further, we will only be interested in the case where the fixed point set of $\\sigma$ (which is known as the real part, and always consists of a finite number $k$ of simple closed curves) divides the surface into two components. Real surfaces $({X},\\sigma)$ can be classified by their `topological type' $(g,k,\\epsilon)$, where $g$ is the genus, $k$ the number of components of the real part as above, and $\\epsilon$ determines whether the fixed point set of $\\sigma$ splits the surface in two ($\\epsilon=0$, the case we require) or leaves it connected ($\\epsilon=1$). A real surface $({X},\\sigma)$ of type $(g,k,0)$ can be built by taking a Riemann surface $Y$ with $k$ boundaries, and sewing it to a reflected copy of itself along the boundaries, a construction called the Schottky double. Then  $\\sigma$ is the involution that simply swaps these two copies. The restriction to surfaces with a reflection symmetry is physically motivated by the interpretation of these surfaces as defining a natural set of states on the tensor product $\\mathcal{H}^{\\otimes k}$ of $k$ copies of the CFT. The wavefunction evaluated on any field configuration is defined by the path integral on $Y$ with the given field configuration as boundary conditions. \n\nAt genus zero, this is just the state-operator correspondence definition of the vacuum, and for genus one, where the reflection symmetry restricts us to the rectangular torus ($\\tau=i\\beta/2\\pi$ pure imaginary), this construction gives the thermofield double state.\n\n For a holographic CFT, these states have geometric duals \\cite{Skenderis:2009ju} which are black holes with $k\\geq1$ asymptotic boundaries, and arbitrary topology behind the horizon \\cite{Aminneborg:1997pz,Brill:1995jv,Brill:1998pr}. Depending on the moduli of ${X}$, there may be several different possible bulk duals, with first order phase transitions between them as we vary the moduli. The dominant solution is expected to respect the involution symmetry $\\sigma$, which extends into the bulk as a time-reflection symmetry. This fixes a $t=0$ slice ${\\Sigma}$ in the bulk, where the quantum state of the bulk fields is defined by a Hartle-Hawking procedure, integrating over configurations on half of the Euclidean bulk, just as in the definition of the boundary state. Because $SL(2,{\\mathbb{R}})$ acts on the equatorial slice of ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$ in precisely the same way as it acts on the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the boundary, there is always a phase in which ${\\Sigma}$ is conformal to $Y$, but there are also phases in which ${\\Sigma}$ is disconnected, so the state in different copies of the CFT may be entangled only through the quantum state of the bulk fields, and not at leading order in the large $c$ semiclassical limit. Since ${\\Sigma}$ has vanishing extrinsic curvature, it provides a good Cauchy slice from which to classically evolve forwards and backwards in Lorentzian time.\n \n \n This general structure can be illustrated by considering the familiar case of genus one, where everything can be explicitly computed. The rectangular torus (type $(1,1,0)$) has two saddle points respecting the reflection symmetry, filling in either the thermal Euclidean time circle, or the spatial circle. In the first case, the bulk $t=0$ slice is a cylinder connecting the two boundary components, which is the Einstein-Rosen bridge of the BTZ black hole, and in the second case ${\\Sigma}$ is two disconnected copies of ${\\mathbb{H}}^2$, the $t=0$ slice of pure $AdS$. The leading classical contribution to the torus partition function always comes from one of these solutions, which exchange dominance at the square torus $\\tau=i$, the $AdS_3$ version of the Hawking-Page phase transition.\n \n \\subsection{Genus two}\n  \nWe now describe the moduli space of real surfaces at genus two. \n\nThere are two topologically distinct types of surfaces admitting a time-reflection symmetry, each with three real moduli. The first, with $(X,\\sigma)$ of type $(2,3,0)$, studied in \\cite{Balasubramanian:2014hda}, is the Schottky double of a pair of pants $Y$, describing an entangled state on three copies of the CFT. The moduli space can be parameterised by the lengths (in the canonical constant curvature metric on ${X}$) of the three circles fixed by $\\sigma$,  $L_a$, $a=1,2,3$. There are three kinds of handlebody saddles which preserve the $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, and thus are expected to dominate the path integral, distinguished by the topology of the time reflection invariant surface ${\\Sigma}$ in the bulk. For the first, ${\\Sigma}$ is a pair of pants, conformal to $Y$, corresponding to a connected wormhole geometry. For the second, ${\\Sigma}$ is  three discs, corresponding to three disconnected copies of $AdS$. Finally it can be a disc plus a cylinder, with three different versions depending on which two boundaries the cylinder joins, corresponding to one copy of $AdS$ and one of BTZ.\n \nThe second possibility is type $(2,1,0)$, so $\\sigma$ fixes just one curve, and $Y$ is a torus with a single boundary. These surfaces define some excited pure state in a single copy of the CFT, once again with three real moduli. For one possible parameterisation of this space, choose a dual pair of cycles on the torus, and give their lengths in the canonical metric on ${X}$, as well as the angle at which they meet. Another possibility is the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, building the bordered torus from a pair of pants, with two cuffs the same length, joining those cuffs with some twist. There are now infinitely many different handlebodies respecting the time reflection symmetry. One has the $t=0$ slice ${\\Sigma}$ equal to $Y$:  this is a single-exterior black hole with a torus hidden behind the horizon. The other phases have ${\\Sigma}$ simply a disc, and are classically dual to pure $AdS$, with the quantum state of the bulk fields depending on which of the possible handlebodies is dominant.\n \nThese two three-parameter subspaces of Riemann surfaces admitting different real structures in fact intersect in a two-dimensional family that admits both types of time-reflection symmetry. From the point of view of the three boundary wormhole, this is the restriction to the subspace where two of the boundaries have the same size, $L_1=L_2$. There is then a reflection symmetry that swaps these two cycles; this is the symmetry that is interpreted as time reflection for the torus wormhole. For the torus, the additional symmetry arises when we demand that there is a dual pair of cycles meeting at right angles, so we have a rectangular torus. We will analyse this two-dimensional subspace. \n\nThere are three possible bulk geometries respecting both of these symmetries. For the three boundary wormhole interpretation, they correspond to a wormhole connecting boundaries of equal size with a disconnected $AdS$ for the third, the totally connected wormhole joining all three boundaries, and a totally disconnected geometry with three copies of $AdS$. In the alternative interpretation, these phases correspond to the single exterior black hole phase, and two different pure $AdS$ phases, where one or other of the cycles of the torus is contractible in the Euclidean bulk.\n\nSolutions in this subspace in fact all have a third reflection symmetry, with total conformal and anticonformal symmetry group ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2 \\times {\\mathbb{Z}}_2 \\times {\\mathbb{Z}}_2$. This additional symmetry can be understood from the fact that every genus 2 surface is hyperelliptic, so it can be represented as an algebraic curve $y^2=p(x)$ for some polynomial $p$ of degree five or six; every such surface admits the hyperelliptic involution $y\\mapsto -y$. When this commutes with the real structure $\\sigma$, the combination of $\\sigma$ with the hyperelliptic involution provides a second inequivalent real structure. For a surface formed by gluing two copies of a pair of pants, this second real structure can be thought of as reflection in the plane splitting the pants in two along the seams. If we call the cuffs of the pants the A-cycles, fixed by the original time reflection, the second real structure fixes a dual set of B-cycles. The surface thus may be reinterpreted by swapping the names of these cycles, and in this interpretation represents a different point in the moduli space of real surfaces of type $(2,3,0)$. This is much the same as the case for a rectangular torus, where there is a spatial reflection symmetry in addition to the time reflection symmetry, so swapping the r\\^oles of space and time gives a different interpretation of the same surface.

There are two distinct one-parameter families of surfaces in our moduli space for which such enhancement occurs, as follows from the classification \\cite{cirre2001complex}, which help to understand some aspects of the phase diagram analytically. These two families meet at a distinguished point in moduli space, a very highly symmetric Riemann surface; this is the genus 2 analogue of the square torus $\\tau=i$. We can identify explicitly the hyperelliptic curve corresponding to this surface, and calculate its cycle lengths analytically, which will act as a check on the numerical results. \n \n The first possible enhancement occurs when all three A-cycles (and hence also all three B-cycles) have the same length, corresponding to three-boundary wormholes with all horizons the same size. The full conformal automorphism group for these surfaces is $D_6$, the dihedral group of order 12, along with the anticonformal time reflection commuting with these.  Here we can explicitly check that the pair of pants and thermal AdS saddles, which preserve the $\\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry, always dominate over the disc plus annulus saddles, which break it. This is also the same family of surfaces relevant for computation of the third R\\'enyi entropy of two disjoint intervals, parametrised by the cross ratio of the intervals' endpoints, so we are also verifying replica symmetry.\n\nThe other symmetry enhancement is an additional ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$, enhancing the conformal automorphism group to $D_4$. From the torus wormhole point of view, this occurs when the two cycles of the torus behind the horizon have equal size. The symmetry exchanges the A-cycles and B-cycles, which have matching lengths for these surfaces. As a consequence, the handlebodies for disconnected and connected phases, which do not respect this symmetry but are exchanged under it, are degenerate. This indicates that the symmetry enhancement is at the boundary separating these two phases. It is possible to analytically calculate the relationships between cycle lengths at this boundary, as we will describe briefly below. However, because the relevant Schottky groups do not respect this symmetry, this information is not helpful for finding the Schottky parameters, and hence the spacetime parameters such as horizon lengths, at the phase transition, which will instead be determined from the numerics. It is worth noting here that the partially connected phase does respect the full symmetry group along this line, but is still subdominant for some values of moduli, so this is an example where the bulk spontaneously breaks a discrete symmetry.\n\nNow these two families of enhanced symmetry meet at a distinguished point in the moduli space of curves where all six A-cycles and B-cycles are all the same length. This is the genus 2 analogue of the point $\\tau=i$ in the torus moduli space, where the horizontal and vertical cycles are the same length\\footnote{This is occasionally referred to as the Bolza surface, though this name is more usually given to the maximally symmetric genus 2 surface, with twice as many automorphisms, but only real structures of type $(2,1,1)$ or $(2,2,1)$, analogous to the torus with $\\tau=e^{i\\pi/3}$.}. From the classification \\cite{cirre2001complex}, there is a unique surface with the appropriate enhancement of symmetries, with a conformal automorphism group of order 24, corresponding to the hyperelliptic curve $y^2=x^6-1$\n. For this surface, it is possible to explicitly work out the lengths of geodesic cycles on the constant curvature metric, which gives us a check on the results.\n\nTo do this, notice that the symmetries allow us to identify a tessellation of the curve by identical hyperbolic triangles. We can identify their edges on the complex $x$-plane, since they all lie on fixed points of some symmetry, as shown in figure \\ref{symmetricSurf}. These triangles all have corner angles $\\pi/2$, $\\pi/4$ and $\\pi/6$, and a little hyperbolic trigonometry gives the side lengths, which are $\\frac{1}{2}\\cosh^{-1}5$, $\\frac{1}{2}\\cosh^{-1}3$, and $\\frac{1}{2}\\cosh^{-1}2$. Now the cycles on the $t=0$ slice of the three boundary wormhole, and the corresponding dual cycles, which we measure in the numerics, correspond to arcs of the unit circle between two of the sixth roots of unity on the $x$-plane, returning by the same arc on the other sheet. These contain four of the short edges of the triangle, so are of length $2\\cosh^{-1}2$. We will verify numerically that this is the cycle length at the point where all six A- and B-cycles have the same length.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{symmetricSurface}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{symmetricSurface2}\n\\caption{The maximally symmetric real genus 2 Riemann surface.

The red points are the sixth roots of unity, where the plane is ramified.

The right diagram shows a fundamental domain of the hyperbolic plane for the surface, which can be represented as a quotient of $\\mathbb{H}^2$. The surface is given by an appropriate identification of edges of this domain. \\label{symmetricSurf}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith a little more effort, we can make progress in calculating cycle lengths more generally. To do this, note that if we cut our surface along all geodesics fixed by symmetry, that is all the curves marked in figure \\ref{SchottkyDomains}, we decompose it into eight pentagons, with right angles at every vertex. With the constant curvature metric, these are right angle hyperbolic pentagons, with side lengths $\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{1,2}^A,\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{1,2}^B,\\frac{1}{4}\\ell_{3}^A,\\frac{1}{4}\\ell_{3}^A,\\frac{1}{4}\\ell_{w}$, where $\\ell_a^{A,B}$ is the lengths of the $a$th A- or B-cycle, and $\\ell_{w}$ the length of the `waist' that divides the surface in two. But there is a two-dimensional space of such pentagons, so specifying two side lengths uniquely determines the others, and in particular, the B-cycle lengths can be analytically determined as a function of the A-cycle lengths. As an example of this, the phase boundary between disconnected and connected phases, which happens when the A-cycle and B-cycle lengths are equal, occurs when\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 28105, "prevtext": "\n\nThe boundary terms are such that the value of the action is independent of the choice of fundamental region $D$ used to evaluate it.

Some progress can be made at the edges of moduli space, where one or more cycles of the Riemann surface shrink to zero size. The contribution of the vacuum block to the partition function in this limit was studied in \\cite{Headrick:2015gba}, which gave loop corrections to high orders in the semiclassical $1/c$ expansion. However, it is not so easy to obtain the classical, order $c$ contribution that we are studying, which is related to the fact that this depends on the choice of frame by the Weyl anomaly, and not just the complex structure of the Riemann surface. In this section, we explicitly compute how the order $c$ part of the partition function in the constant curvature frame behaves in a pinching limit, in terms of the length $\\ell$ of the pinching cycle.\n\nTo do this, we consider cutting the Riemann surface along the short cycle, and insert a complete set of states, which equates the partition function to a sum of two-point functions on a simpler (possibly disconnected) Riemann surface; see \\cite{Headrick:2015gba}, particularly the final appendix, for more details. The contribution from each state comes with $\\ell$ to the power of the dimension, so the sum will be dominated by the vacuum state in the pinching limit. The vacuum is prepared by the path integral on hemispheres, which we sew to each side of the cut cycle, normalised by dividing by the partition function on a sphere of the same radius. So in the pinching limit, we find the leading order piece of the partition function by cutting the surface along the cycle, inserting hemispherical `caps', and dividing by the partition function for the sphere of that radius:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 48422, "prevtext": "\n\nfor the non-handlebody solution. \n\nFor our results below, we will normalise ${\\mathcal{Z}}$ by choosing $R_0=1$, so in particular the action for the non-handlebody is zero.\n\n\n\\section{A two-parameter family of surfaces}\n\\label{surf}\n\nOur discussion so far has been completely general; it could be applied to the calculation of the bulk action for any Riemann surface ${X}$ at any point in its moduli space. To illustrate our numerical methods, we will explictly compute $\\phi$ for a simple family of genus two surfaces: we consider a two real-dimensional subspace of the full three complex-dimensional moduli space of genus two surfaces. This is a subspace of the three real-dimensional space of surfaces with a reflection symmetry considered in \\cite{Balasubramanian:2014hda}, describing multiboundary wormholes. This same subspace also arises as a subspace of the set of genus two surfaces which can be interpreted as states with a single boundary. In addition to the physical interest of these interpetations, the symmetry of ${X}$ in this subspace allows us to restrict consideration to bulk saddle points which preserve this symmetry, so we will be able to completely map out the relevant phases. In this section, we describe this subspace in more detail, and identify the bulk saddle points which preserve the symmetry and explain their physical interpretations.\n\n\\subsection{Reflection symmetric surfaces}\n\nWe first restrict to a class of Riemann surfaces with a reflection symmetry. Mathematically, this can be described as a \\emph{real structure}, which is a notion of complex conjugation on the surface. This is defined as an involutive anticonformal automorphism $\\sigma$. Further, we will only be interested in the case where the fixed point set of $\\sigma$ (which is known as the real part, and always consists of a finite number $k$ of simple closed curves) divides the surface into two components. Real surfaces $({X},\\sigma)$ can be classified by their `topological type' $(g,k,\\epsilon)$, where $g$ is the genus, $k$ the number of components of the real part as above, and $\\epsilon$ determines whether the fixed point set of $\\sigma$ splits the surface in two ($\\epsilon=0$, the case we require) or leaves it connected ($\\epsilon=1$). A real surface $({X},\\sigma)$ of type $(g,k,0)$ can be built by taking a Riemann surface $Y$ with $k$ boundaries, and sewing it to a reflected copy of itself along the boundaries, a construction called the Schottky double. Then  $\\sigma$ is the involution that simply swaps these two copies. The restriction to surfaces with a reflection symmetry is physically motivated by the interpretation of these surfaces as defining a natural set of states on the tensor product $\\mathcal{H}^{\\otimes k}$ of $k$ copies of the CFT. The wavefunction evaluated on any field configuration is defined by the path integral on $Y$ with the given field configuration as boundary conditions. \n\nAt genus zero, this is just the state-operator correspondence definition of the vacuum, and for genus one, where the reflection symmetry restricts us to the rectangular torus ($\\tau=i\\beta/2\\pi$ pure imaginary), this construction gives the thermofield double state.\n\n For a holographic CFT, these states have geometric duals \\cite{Skenderis:2009ju} which are black holes with $k\\geq1$ asymptotic boundaries, and arbitrary topology behind the horizon \\cite{Aminneborg:1997pz,Brill:1995jv,Brill:1998pr}. Depending on the moduli of ${X}$, there may be several different possible bulk duals, with first order phase transitions between them as we vary the moduli. The dominant solution is expected to respect the involution symmetry $\\sigma$, which extends into the bulk as a time-reflection symmetry. This fixes a $t=0$ slice ${\\Sigma}$ in the bulk, where the quantum state of the bulk fields is defined by a Hartle-Hawking procedure, integrating over configurations on half of the Euclidean bulk, just as in the definition of the boundary state. Because $SL(2,{\\mathbb{R}})$ acts on the equatorial slice of ${\\mathbb{H}}^3$ in precisely the same way as it acts on the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the boundary, there is always a phase in which ${\\Sigma}$ is conformal to $Y$, but there are also phases in which ${\\Sigma}$ is disconnected, so the state in different copies of the CFT may be entangled only through the quantum state of the bulk fields, and not at leading order in the large $c$ semiclassical limit. Since ${\\Sigma}$ has vanishing extrinsic curvature, it provides a good Cauchy slice from which to classically evolve forwards and backwards in Lorentzian time.\n \n \n This general structure can be illustrated by considering the familiar case of genus one, where everything can be explicitly computed. The rectangular torus (type $(1,1,0)$) has two saddle points respecting the reflection symmetry, filling in either the thermal Euclidean time circle, or the spatial circle. In the first case, the bulk $t=0$ slice is a cylinder connecting the two boundary components, which is the Einstein-Rosen bridge of the BTZ black hole, and in the second case ${\\Sigma}$ is two disconnected copies of ${\\mathbb{H}}^2$, the $t=0$ slice of pure $AdS$. The leading classical contribution to the torus partition function always comes from one of these solutions, which exchange dominance at the square torus $\\tau=i$, the $AdS_3$ version of the Hawking-Page phase transition.\n \n \\subsection{Genus two}\n  \nWe now describe the moduli space of real surfaces at genus two. \n\nThere are two topologically distinct types of surfaces admitting a time-reflection symmetry, each with three real moduli. The first, with $(X,\\sigma)$ of type $(2,3,0)$, studied in \\cite{Balasubramanian:2014hda}, is the Schottky double of a pair of pants $Y$, describing an entangled state on three copies of the CFT. The moduli space can be parameterised by the lengths (in the canonical constant curvature metric on ${X}$) of the three circles fixed by $\\sigma$,  $L_a$, $a=1,2,3$. There are three kinds of handlebody saddles which preserve the $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, and thus are expected to dominate the path integral, distinguished by the topology of the time reflection invariant surface ${\\Sigma}$ in the bulk. For the first, ${\\Sigma}$ is a pair of pants, conformal to $Y$, corresponding to a connected wormhole geometry. For the second, ${\\Sigma}$ is  three discs, corresponding to three disconnected copies of $AdS$. Finally it can be a disc plus a cylinder, with three different versions depending on which two boundaries the cylinder joins, corresponding to one copy of $AdS$ and one of BTZ.\n \nThe second possibility is type $(2,1,0)$, so $\\sigma$ fixes just one curve, and $Y$ is a torus with a single boundary. These surfaces define some excited pure state in a single copy of the CFT, once again with three real moduli. For one possible parameterisation of this space, choose a dual pair of cycles on the torus, and give their lengths in the canonical metric on ${X}$, as well as the angle at which they meet. Another possibility is the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates, building the bordered torus from a pair of pants, with two cuffs the same length, joining those cuffs with some twist. There are now infinitely many different handlebodies respecting the time reflection symmetry. One has the $t=0$ slice ${\\Sigma}$ equal to $Y$:  this is a single-exterior black hole with a torus hidden behind the horizon. The other phases have ${\\Sigma}$ simply a disc, and are classically dual to pure $AdS$, with the quantum state of the bulk fields depending on which of the possible handlebodies is dominant.\n \nThese two three-parameter subspaces of Riemann surfaces admitting different real structures in fact intersect in a two-dimensional family that admits both types of time-reflection symmetry. From the point of view of the three boundary wormhole, this is the restriction to the subspace where two of the boundaries have the same size, $L_1=L_2$. There is then a reflection symmetry that swaps these two cycles; this is the symmetry that is interpreted as time reflection for the torus wormhole. For the torus, the additional symmetry arises when we demand that there is a dual pair of cycles meeting at right angles, so we have a rectangular torus. We will analyse this two-dimensional subspace. \n\nThere are three possible bulk geometries respecting both of these symmetries. For the three boundary wormhole interpretation, they correspond to a wormhole connecting boundaries of equal size with a disconnected $AdS$ for the third, the totally connected wormhole joining all three boundaries, and a totally disconnected geometry with three copies of $AdS$. In the alternative interpretation, these phases correspond to the single exterior black hole phase, and two different pure $AdS$ phases, where one or other of the cycles of the torus is contractible in the Euclidean bulk.\n\nSolutions in this subspace in fact all have a third reflection symmetry, with total conformal and anticonformal symmetry group ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2 \\times {\\mathbb{Z}}_2 \\times {\\mathbb{Z}}_2$. This additional symmetry can be understood from the fact that every genus 2 surface is hyperelliptic, so it can be represented as an algebraic curve $y^2=p(x)$ for some polynomial $p$ of degree five or six; every such surface admits the hyperelliptic involution $y\\mapsto -y$. When this commutes with the real structure $\\sigma$, the combination of $\\sigma$ with the hyperelliptic involution provides a second inequivalent real structure. For a surface formed by gluing two copies of a pair of pants, this second real structure can be thought of as reflection in the plane splitting the pants in two along the seams. If we call the cuffs of the pants the A-cycles, fixed by the original time reflection, the second real structure fixes a dual set of B-cycles. The surface thus may be reinterpreted by swapping the names of these cycles, and in this interpretation represents a different point in the moduli space of real surfaces of type $(2,3,0)$. This is much the same as the case for a rectangular torus, where there is a spatial reflection symmetry in addition to the time reflection symmetry, so swapping the r\\^oles of space and time gives a different interpretation of the same surface. Any handlebody solution can also be interpreted from these two points of view, so a Euclidean geometry corresponding to a connected phase can be reinterpreted as the disconnected phase for a different point in moduli space.\n\nThe full order 8 symmetry group is manifest in the Schottky groups and fundamental domains $D$ we choose, as reflections and inversions. This is be useful for increasing the numerical efficiency, since it allows us to solve the Liouville equation in a region $\\tilde{D}$ one eighth the size of the full fundamental domain, inferring the values elsewhere by the equivariance of $\\phi$ under the symmetries. Expressions for the action in the form of integrals only over $\\tilde{D}$ and its boundaries are given in appendix \\ref{integrals}. The calculations in the reduced domain agree to numerical accuracy with those done in the full domain with the original action \\eqref{TZact}, but are more computationally efficient. The fundamental domains for the Schottky groups we use are shown in figure \\ref{SchottkyDomains}, and described in more detail in the appendix.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.55\\textwidth]{domain1}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.33\\textwidth]{domain2}\n\t\\\\\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.9\\textwidth]{surface}\n\t\\caption{The choice of fundamental domains $D$ we use for the relevant Schottky groups $G$, corresponding in the three boundary wormhole to the connected phase (left) and partially connected (right), and a cartoon of the surface we consider with various relevant cycles marked.

The surface is given by an appropriate identification of edges of this domain. \\label{symmetricSurf}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith a little more effort, we can make progress in calculating cycle lengths more generally. To do this, note that if we cut our surface along all geodesics fixed by symmetry, that is all the curves marked in figure \\ref{SchottkyDomains}, we decompose it into eight pentagons, with right angles at every vertex. With the constant curvature metric, these are right angle hyperbolic pentagons, with side lengths $\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{1,2}^A,\\frac{1}{2}\\ell_{1,2}^B,\\frac{1}{4}\\ell_{3}^A,\\frac{1}{4}\\ell_{3}^A,\\frac{1}{4}\\ell_{w}$, where $\\ell_a^{A,B}$ is the lengths of the $a$th A- or B-cycle, and $\\ell_{w}$ the length of the `waist' that divides the surface in two. But there is a two-dimensional space of such pentagons, so specifying two side lengths uniquely determines the others, and in particular, the B-cycle lengths can be analytically determined as a function of the A-cycle lengths. As an example of this, the phase boundary between disconnected and connected phases, which happens when the A-cycle and B-cycle lengths are equal, occurs when\n\n", "index": 27, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:conDiscTransition}\n\t\\ell_3 = 4\\coth^{-1} \\sinh \\left(\\frac{\\ell_{1,2}}{2}\\right) \\, .\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E14.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\ell_{3}=4\\coth^{-1}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\ell_{1,2}}{2}\\right)\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2113</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>coth</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>sinh</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2113</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00980.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere ${\\mathcal{Z}}[\\cdot]$ is the partition function of the indicated surface, and the images should be interpreted as small pieces, near the pinching cycle (marked in red), of some Riemann surface.\n\nIn any neighbourhood of the cycle topologically equivalent to a cylinder, by the uniformisation theorem the geometry is determined uniquely by the length of the cycle.

Some progress can be made at the edges of moduli space, where one or more cycles of the Riemann surface shrink to zero size. The contribution of the vacuum block to the partition function in this limit was studied in \\cite{Headrick:2015gba}, which gave loop corrections to high orders in the semiclassical $1/c$ expansion. However, it is not so easy to obtain the classical, order $c$ contribution that we are studying, which is related to the fact that this depends on the choice of frame by the Weyl anomaly, and not just the complex structure of the Riemann surface. In this section, we explicitly compute how the order $c$ part of the partition function in the constant curvature frame behaves in a pinching limit, in terms of the length $\\ell$ of the pinching cycle.\n\nTo do this, we consider cutting the Riemann surface along the short cycle, and insert a complete set of states, which equates the partition function to a sum of two-point functions on a simpler (possibly disconnected) Riemann surface; see \\cite{Headrick:2015gba}, particularly the final appendix, for more details. The contribution from each state comes with $\\ell$ to the power of the dimension, so the sum will be dominated by the vacuum state in the pinching limit. The vacuum is prepared by the path integral on hemispheres, which we sew to each side of the cut cycle, normalised by dividing by the partition function on a sphere of the same radius. So in the pinching limit, we find the leading order piece of the partition function by cutting the surface along the cycle, inserting hemispherical `caps', and dividing by the partition function for the sphere of that radius:\n\n", "index": 29, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\t\\left. {\\mathcal{Z}}\\left[{\\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height={6}ex]{{pinching1}}}}} \\right] \\sim {\\mathcal{Z}}\\left[{\\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height={6}ex]{{pinching2}}}}} \\right] \\middle/ {\\mathcal{Z}}\\left[{\\vcenter{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[height={4}ex]{{pinching3}}}}} \\right] \\right. \\text{ as }\\ell\\to 0\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\left.{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left[{\\vbox{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[[height=0.0pt]]{{%&#10;pinching1}}}}}\\right]\\sim{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left[{\\vbox{\\hbox{\\includegraphics[[hei%&#10;ght=0.0pt]]{{pinching2}}}}}\\right]\\middle/{\\mathcal{Z}}\\left[{\\vbox{\\hbox{%&#10;\\includegraphics[[height=0.0pt]]{{pinching3}}}}}\\right]\\right.\\text{ as }\\ell\\to&#10;0\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcb5</mi><mrow><mo>[</mo><mtext mathcolor=\"red\"><img xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" src=\"\" id=\"S0.E15.m1.g1nest\" class=\"ltx_graphics\" alt=\"\"/></mtext><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u223c</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcb5</mi><mrow><mo>[</mo><mtext mathcolor=\"red\"><img xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" src=\"\" id=\"S0.E15.m1.g2nest\" class=\"ltx_graphics\" alt=\"\"/></mtext><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcb5</mi><mrow><mo>[</mo><mtext mathcolor=\"red\"><img xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" src=\"\" id=\"S0.E15.m1.g3nest\" class=\"ltx_graphics\" alt=\"\"/></mtext><mo>]</mo></mrow><mtext>\u00a0as\u00a0</mtext><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2113</mi><mo>\u2192</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00980.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith our cycle at $r=0$, valid for some range of the coordinate $r$.

Without such a symmetry, one would require some means of imposing the quasi-periodic boundary condition more explicitly, such as a master/slave method that replaces degrees of freedom on $C_i'$ with those on $C_i$.}. The domain can be further reduced by lines of reflection symmetry without changing these boundary terms.  The lines themselves have no boundary contribution, which is equivalent to a Neumann boundary condition.  \n\nAt each Newton iteration, we are given $\\phi$, and the aim is to find a $\\delta\\phi$ such that the integral equation \\eqref{integraleq} is valid for any $\\psi$ in some space of functions.  For us, this will be a Sobolev space of piecewise continuous second-order polynomials.  We will also approximate $\\phi$ and $\\delta \\phi$ using functions within this Sobolev space.\n\nFollowing the finite element method, we decompose the domain into a mesh of triangular `elements'.\\footnote{Common mesh generation algorithms include Chew's second algorithm and Ruppert's algorithm for generating (constrained) Delaunay triangulations.  We simply use internal mesh generation routines in \\texttt{Mathematica 10}'s FEM package.}  The decomposition must be a valid triangulation in that triangles must meet edge to edge and vertex to vertex. On the boundaries, we allow the triangles to have curved edges.  On each vertex and the midpoint of each edge, place a node.  Each triangular element therefore has six nodes, and these nodes are shared between adjacent elements. Examples are shown in figure \\ref{mesh}.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.35\\textwidth]{mesh1}\\qquad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.35\\textwidth]{mesh2}\n\\caption{Examples of the meshes used for the two types of Schottky group, in this case at the triple point where all phases meet.\\label{mesh}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith a valid mesh, we can now define our Sobolev space.  For each of the nodes $i$, we can define a function $\\psi_i$ that satisfies  $\\psi_i(x_j,y_j)=\\delta_{ij}$ for all nodes $j$ with coordinates $(x_j,y_j)$.  In two dimensions, a second-order polynomial is uniquely specified by its value on six points, and each element contains six nodes.  We can therefore extend $\\psi_i$ to non-nodal points via polynomial interpolation within each element. This yields a set of piecewise continuous functions $\\psi_i$ that are second-order polynomials in each element. The span of all $\\psi_i$ together with the standard integral $L^2$ norm forms a Sobolev space which is our space of functions.  \n\nGiven the values of any $C^2$ function $\\phi$ on the nodes $\\phi_k=\\phi(x_k,y_k)$, we can approximate $\\phi$ using an element of the Sobolev space as $\\phi(x,y)\\approx \\sum_{k}\\phi_k \\psi_k(x,y)$. By construction, this approximation agrees with the true function $\\phi$ on the nodes. The approximation can be improved by making the mesh finer.  Because these are second-order polynomials, the approximation should improve roughly cubically with the number of elements, assuming an evenly distributed mesh.\n\nNow let us describe how to solve the integral form of the linear equation above. We decompose the integrals as a sum of integrals on each element, and approximate all functions as functions on our Sobolev space.  Within each element, integrals and derivatives can be computed from second-order polynomials\\footnote{In practice, integrals are computed using Gaussian quadrature, and differentiation matrices are derived by differentiating the $\\psi_i(x,y)$ on each of the nodes.}.  If we take as a test function a basis function $\\psi_i$, the integral equation reduces to an equation of the form $\\sum_jA_{ij}\\delta\\phi_j=b_i$.  Over all basis functions, this defines a matrix $A_{ij}$ and a vector $b_i$, which gives a sparse linear algebraic system that can be solved using standard algorithms such as multifrontal methods. \n\nWe note that the nodes that lie on the boundary of the domain $D$ contribute to the boundary terms in the integral equation. The fact that the interior nodes have no such contribution is equivalent to requiring that outward-pointing normal derivatives cancel between adjacent elements. This enforces the continuity of the first derivatives of the functions in the fine mesh limit.  (Continuity of the functions themselves was already guaranteed by the piecewise construction of the Sobolev space.) This is why the second-derivative terms were integrated by parts in the integral equation. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{plot1}\\qquad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{plot2}\n\\caption{Plots of the solutions of the Liouville equation for each of the phases, at the triple point where all phases meet.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:convergence}, we show the convergence of this numerical method.  As a measure of error, we compute the area of the entire Riemann surface under the metric \\eqref{smet}.  According to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, this area must be $4\\pi$ on a genus-2 surface with the constant curvature metric $R=-2$.

Horizon lengths can be obtained from these parameters via \\label{eq:geoLengths}.  From each solution, we obtain the cycle lengths $\\ell_a$ of the A-cycles and B-cycles by numerically integrating $\\int_C e^\\phi $ along the curves  described in figure \\ref{SchottkyDomains}, which are geodesic from symmetry. This allows us to match the moduli of Schottky groups in different phases. We then compute the on-shell bulk action $I$ from the integrals in appendix \\ref{integrals}. Since the bulk saddles corresponding to connected and disconnected phases are related by the additional $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, there are two families of solutions we must find in order to complete the phase diagram.  One family allows us to obtain both the connected wormhole phase and the fully disconnected phase.  Each solution in this family will have one value of the action, but two different set of lengths $\\ell_a$, depending on which $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is viewed as a time reflection symmetry.  The second family corresponds to the partially connected phases with AdS and a BTZ black hole.  \n\n\\section{Results for genus two}\n\\label{res}\n\nConsider first the subspace with cycle lengths $\\ell\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2=\\ell_3$, which has a ${\\mathbb{Z}}_3$ symmetry exchanging the boundaries. There are two phases respecting the full symmetry group, corresponding to connected and disconnected spacetimes, and we also consider a partially connected phase breaking the ${\\mathbb{Z}}_3$ symmetry.  We can directly restrict the parameters of our Schottky groups to this symmetry in the totally connected/disconnected families, though in the partially connected family it is not manifest which Schottky parameters correspond to equal cycle lengths, so we must scan the two-dimensional $\\ell_1=\\ell_2$ space of parameters and use interpolation to obtain actions and cycle lengths for the $\\ell\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2=\\ell_3$ family.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\textwidth]{actions.pdf}\n\t\\label{fig:actions} \n\t\\caption{Bulk action as a function of cycle lengths $\\ell\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2=\\ell_3$, normalised to that of the most symmetric surface $\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}\\equiv2\\log(2+\\sqrt 3)$.

At smaller lengths, the totally disconnected (three copies of AdS) phase is preferred (red in colour version), while for larger lengths, the connected wormhole is preferred (blue in colour version).  The phase transition between these occurs precisely at the length $\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}$. The AdS plus BTZ phase (black in colour version) is never dominant. All phases have a lower action than the non-handlebody phases ($I/c=0$.)}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:actions}, we plot the bulk action as a function of $\\ell$. We find that the AdS plus BTZ phase is never dominant.  At smaller lengths, the totally disconnected (three copies of AdS) phase is preferred, while for larger lengths, the connected wormhole is preferred.  The phase transition between these phases occurs for the maximally symmetric real Riemann surface where $\\ell=\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}=2\\log(2+\\sqrt 3)$, which corresponds to horizon sizes $\\lambda_{1,2,3}\\approx 7.30$, slightly larger than the $2\\pi$ horizon length corresponding to the Hawking-Page transition for the thermofield double.\n\nGeneralising to the two-dimensional family with $\\ell_{12}\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2$, all three phases we consider are dominant for some region of moduli space.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\textwidth]{phasediagram.pdf}\n\t\\caption{Phase diagram over cycle lengths $\\ell_{12}\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_3$, normalised to that of the most symmetric surface $\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}\\equiv2\\log(2+\\sqrt 3)$. The partially connected phase shown here connects the two $\\ell_1=\\ell_2$ cycles together.  The remaining partially connected phase is never dominant.\\label{fig:phasediagram}}\n\\end{figure}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:phasediagram}, we show the phase diagram of solutions in this family, as a function of the cycle lengths of the Riemann surface.  The phase boundaries are found using interpolation. We see that the disconnected phase is preferred whenever $\\ell_{12}$ is small, the partially connected phase (where boundaries with equal lengths are connected) is preferred whenever $\\ell_{12}$ is large and $\\ell_3$ is small, and the connected phase is preferred when all lengths are large. We also checked the handlebodies corresponding to a partially connected phase with the third boundary connected to one of the first two, which would break the symmetry swapping boundaries one and two (interpreted as time-reversal for the torus wormhole), finding they are never preferred.\nWe also find that all of these phases have an action below that of the non-handlebody solution (with $I=0$) throughout moduli space, though the subdominant solution appears to approach zero at the edges of moduli space.\n\nThe boundary between the connected and disconnected phases lies on the line of enhanced symmetry given by equation \\eqref{eq:conDiscTransition}, where the A- and B-cycles have equal sizes, though connected and disconnected solutions spontaneously break this symmetry. The phase boundary ends at the tricritical point, where the partially connected phase takes over, and the handlebody respects the symmetry, acting by swapping the two generators (demanding $\\alpha=\\hat{\\alpha}$ in the notation of the appendix).\n\nThe corresponding horizon sizes for the connected phase at the phase boundaries, determined by the Schottky parameters, are shown in figure \\ref{fig:horizonPhases}. In particular, along the phase transition between connected and disconnected phases, taking $\\ell_3\\to\\infty$, the third horizon $\\lambda_3$ in the connected phase is large but the lengths $\\lambda_{12}$ of the two equal horizons approach $2\\pi$ from above.  \n\nAt the phase boundary between the connected and partially connected phase (see lower left plot of figure \\ref{fig:horizonPhases}), we find the striking result that the horizon length $\\lambda_3$ of the connected phase is $\\lambda_3\\approx 6.283$, agreeing with $2\\pi$ to high accuracy (to around one part in $10^4$ at the triple point), along the entire phase boundary.  A similar agreement with $2\\pi$ appears in the partially connected phase as well, where the length of a geodesic circling in the Euclidean time (homotopic to the third B-cycle) agrees with $2\\pi$ to a similar accuracy.  Swapping A- and B-cycles to reinterpret this as the disconnected/partially connected phase boundary, this geodesic becomes the horizon of the BTZ part of the partially connected geometry, so the transition from partially connected to disconnected appears for approximately the same BTZ horizon size as the Hawking-Page transition.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\textwidth]{horizons1}\\vspace{1cm}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.41\\textwidth]{horizonPhases}\\qquad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.42\\textwidth]{horizons2}\n\t\\caption{The horizon lengths in the connected phase at the boundaries where it meets the other phases. The upper plot shows $\\lambda_{12}$ (blue) and $\\lambda_3$ (red) as a function of the cycle length $\\ell_3$, along the boundary with the disconnected phase; in the shaded part to the left of the dashed line, the partially connected phase is dominant. The lower left diagram shows the horizon lengths at which the connected phase becomes subdominant to the other phases, so the allowed horizon lengths in this phase are in the region in the top right, bounded by the solid lines. The lower right diagram shows the BTZ horizon length $\\lambda_\\text{BTZ}$ in the partially connected phase where it transitions to the connected phase with horizon lengths $\\lambda_{12}$ (and $\\lambda_3\\approx 2\\pi$, not shown); these have physical interpretations as the entropy of boundaries 1 and 2 either side of the transition. In the lower diagrams, dashed curves indicate where the two phases involved in the transition are both subdominant to the third phase.\\label{fig:horizonPhases}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn terms of the torus wormhole, the interpretation of these results is that the black hole phase is dominant roughly when both the internal cycles of the torus have length of at least $2\\pi$. In particular, the minimal horizon length, occurring for the square torus at the triple point, is at $\\lambda\\approx 22.3$, much greater than the Hawking-Page value.\n\nOn more careful investigation, this phase transition does not correspond to horizon sizes of \\emph{exactly} $2\\pi$, except perhaps in the limit $\\ell_{12}\\to\\infty$ at the edge of moduli space. We checked this by setting the various $\\lambda$'s in question to $2\\pi$ and scanning the resulting one-parameter families of solutions.  We find that for sufficiently small $\\ell_{12}$, these lines do not have matching cycle lengths, though the deviations quickly become very small as $\\ell_{12}$ increases.  In particular, this implies that if the connected/partially connected phase boundary were extended much farther into the region where the disconnected phase is dominant, then the horizon lengths will show appreciable deviations from $2\\pi$. The lack of matching is particularly obvious in the limit $\\ell_{12}\\to 0$, as one of the proposed families has $\\ell_3\\to\\infty$ while for the other $\\ell_3$ remains finite in the limit. We do not yet have an explanation for why the lengths approximate $2\\pi$ so well for such a large range of parameters. \n\nFinally, we compared our numerical results with the pinching limits analytically obtained in section \\ref{sec:pinching}. The numerics becomes difficult for small cycle lengths, due to a large separation of scales in the domain, so this check is not very precise, though we find good agreement. For example, taking the pinching limit $\\ell_3\\to0$ along the line separating disconnected and partially connected phases, a fit of the action to a function $-A \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\ell_3^{-p}+C$ using 64 data points with $0.76\\lesssim \\ell_3 \\lesssim 1$ gives parameters $p\\approx 1.03, A\\approx .99$. Data for this pinching limit is shown in figure \\ref{pinchData}, plotted against $-\\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\ell_3}+C$ with a one-parameter fit of the additive constant.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{pinchData1}\\quad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{pinchData2}\n\t\\caption{The action at the phase transition between partially connected and disconnected phases, compared with the analytic result $I/c=-\\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\ell_3}$ in the $\\ell_3\\to0$ limit (dashed curve).

The right plot shows the same data on a log-log scale.\\label{pinchData}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nA Riemann surface of genus $g \\geq 1$ can be described by Schottky uniformisation as a region in the complex plane with identified boundaries. This Schottky uniformisation description can be extended to a quotient of $\\mathbb H^3$, giving a handlebody solution in a Euclidean bulk, holographically dual to the field theory on the Riemann surface. A given Riemann surface has infinitely many Schottky uniformisations; from the bulk perspective these correspond to different handlebodies, characterised by the choice of boundary cycles which become contractible in the bulk. The geometry of least action dominates in the calculation of the partition function. \n\nIn \\cite{Krasnov:2000zq}, the calculation of the action of the bulk handlebodies was reduced to the calculation of the Takhtajan-Zograf action \\cite{TZ} for a boundary Liouville field, describing the conformal map from the flat metric on the complex plane to the chosen metric on the Riemann surface. We have shown how, choosing a canonical constant negative curvature metric, this Liouville field may be computed numerically using finite element methods, and the Takhtajan-Zograf action evaluated. Apart from the importance for holographic studies, the solution for the Liouville field may be of some mathematical interest. \n\nWe explicitly calculated the action for some bulk handlebody solutions in a two-dimensional subspace of the moduli space of genus two Riemann surfaces with three commuting reflection symmetries. Restricting to handlebodies preserving these symmetries allows us to consider finitely many solutions, three in this case. These surfaces have two distinct interpretations as preparing Lorentzian states on the circles of reflection symmetry: they give a state in three copies of the CFT, or a state in a single copy of the CFT. In the first interpretation, the Lorentzian analogues of the handlebodies we consider are a three-boundary wormhole, a totally disconnected space, and a two-boundary wormhole plus a disconnected space. In the second, they are two different versions of pure AdS and a single-exterior black hole with a torus behind the horizon. We also compared these solutions to a non-handlebody solution obtained as the quotient of a Euclidean wormhole. \n\nWe compared the actions for these different solutions and determined the dominant solution as a function of the two moduli. We confirmed the accuracy of the numerical results by comparing to analytic expectations at special values of the moduli, and in pinching limits at the boundary of the moduli space. There is a line in the moduli space with a $\\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry; along this line, we found that the $\\mathbb Z_3$ symmetric saddles dominated, and there is a Hawking-Page like phase transition between the connected and disconnected phases. However, along another line in the moduli space with an enhanced $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, preserved by the partially connected phase but not the others, the symmetric phase does not always dominate. The full phase diagram is given in figure \\ref{fig:phasediagram}. The handlebodies always dominate over the non-handlebody solution. \n\nOur results largely confirm previous expectations, but it is worth noting that symmetric solutions are not always dominant over those which spontaneously break the symmetry. This is similar to the square torus, the critical surface at the Hawking-Page phase transition, with a similar extra symmetry spontaneously broken by both dominant phases, although in that case there exists no handlebody that respects the full symmetry group of the boundary. It would be interesting to understand which symmetries are always preserved and which may be spontaneously broken. We should note that an important class of symmetries, which have interpretations as time-reversal ($\\epsilon=0$ type real structures, in the language of section \\ref{surf}), are found never to be broken in our examples, given the phases we have checked. Such a symmetry breaking would make semiclassical Lorentzian interpretation of the dual geometry more difficult, since there would be no natural $t=0$ slice on which to define the Hartle-Hawking state. Furthermore, if all such symmetries are preserved, it implies that there is no breaking of replica symmetry in calculations of R\\'enyi entropies (at least for time-reversal invariant states and subsystems), since the dihedral replica symmetry group can be generated by such reflections.\n\nWe found that along the boundaries separating the partially connected phase from the others, certain horizon lengths approach $2\\pi$ at the edges of moduli space, and this remains a very good approximation well into the centre of moduli space. It would be interesting to analytically understand these edges of moduli space, including the corrections to explain why the approximation remains good in a regime na\\\"ively so far from the limit. This would no doubt be useful for more general Riemann surfaces, and since the approximation is valid in such a wide parameter range there is more hope for good analytic understanding than one might have expected. A direct CFT calculation may also be tractable in such limits, giving an interpretion of the phases as dominance of the vacuum Virasoro block propagating in certain cycles.\n\nAn obvious avenue for future work is to extend to higher genus, where an increased number of boundaries allows for a richer multiparty entanglement structure. It is in fact possible to deduce results at higher genus for some special moduli already without further work via a trick, whereby we may extend a pair of pants decomposition of a surface into the bulk, cutting certain handles of a handlebody, and getting the action for each solid pair of pants from the genus 2 results. This is usually not possible because the cutoff surface chosen (or equivalently the Liouville field) depends on the surface globally, and this affects the action of each component. However, if the cycles we cut along are fixed by a reflection symmetry, the cutoff in each pair of pants component is identical to the cutoff for half the genus two surface, so the action can be found. In terms of the Schottky domain, this is manifested by the domain $D$ being divided into pairs of pants bounded by geodesics (at known locations fixed by symmetries), which allows solution of the Liouville equation without reference to the identifications used. As a simple example of the sort of result that  can be deduced from this idea, the four boundary wormhole with equally sized boundaries arranged to have the symmetries of a square (boundaries lying in a plane, one at each vertex of the square, roughly speaking) has a transition from connected to disconnected phases at horizon sizes $\\lambda\\approx 7.62$.\n\n One application of the results is to see what the phase structure implies for the possible structure of entanglement in these states. For example, a phase transition may prevent the moduli from ever exhibiting intrinsically $n$-party entanglement in the sense of \\cite{Balasubramanian:2014hda}, or, more generally, may restrict the entropy cone of \\cite{Bao:2015bfa}. The reason for this is that choosing horizon sizes large enough to be above the phase transition may imply that every hyperbolic surface has another internal cycle short enough to enter a Ryu-Takayanagi calculation. For example, taking the four boundary wormhole with the symmetries of a square as in the previous paragraph, the internal moduli are relevant for horizon sizes $\\lambda \\gtrsim 2.12$, far below the phase transition point deduced above.\n \n It would also be interesting to check whether geodesics that leave the constant time slice can ever be short enough to dominate the entanglement entropy, as discussed in \\cite{Maxfield:2014kra}, where for the torus this possibility was shown to be prevented only by the phase structure.\n \n\n\\paragraph{Acknowledgements}\nIt is a pleasure to thank Alex Maloney for helpful discussions.

Without such a symmetry, one would require some means of imposing the quasi-periodic boundary condition more explicitly, such as a master/slave method that replaces degrees of freedom on $C_i'$ with those on $C_i$.}. The domain can be further reduced by lines of reflection symmetry without changing these boundary terms.  The lines themselves have no boundary contribution, which is equivalent to a Neumann boundary condition.  \n\nAt each Newton iteration, we are given $\\phi$, and the aim is to find a $\\delta\\phi$ such that the integral equation \\eqref{integraleq} is valid for any $\\psi$ in some space of functions.  For us, this will be a Sobolev space of piecewise continuous second-order polynomials.  We will also approximate $\\phi$ and $\\delta \\phi$ using functions within this Sobolev space.\n\nFollowing the finite element method, we decompose the domain into a mesh of triangular `elements'.\\footnote{Common mesh generation algorithms include Chew's second algorithm and Ruppert's algorithm for generating (constrained) Delaunay triangulations.  We simply use internal mesh generation routines in \\texttt{Mathematica 10}'s FEM package.}  The decomposition must be a valid triangulation in that triangles must meet edge to edge and vertex to vertex. On the boundaries, we allow the triangles to have curved edges.  On each vertex and the midpoint of each edge, place a node.  Each triangular element therefore has six nodes, and these nodes are shared between adjacent elements. Examples are shown in figure \\ref{mesh}.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.35\\textwidth]{mesh1}\\qquad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.35\\textwidth]{mesh2}\n\\caption{Examples of the meshes used for the two types of Schottky group, in this case at the triple point where all phases meet.\\label{mesh}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith a valid mesh, we can now define our Sobolev space.  For each of the nodes $i$, we can define a function $\\psi_i$ that satisfies  $\\psi_i(x_j,y_j)=\\delta_{ij}$ for all nodes $j$ with coordinates $(x_j,y_j)$.  In two dimensions, a second-order polynomial is uniquely specified by its value on six points, and each element contains six nodes.  We can therefore extend $\\psi_i$ to non-nodal points via polynomial interpolation within each element. This yields a set of piecewise continuous functions $\\psi_i$ that are second-order polynomials in each element. The span of all $\\psi_i$ together with the standard integral $L^2$ norm forms a Sobolev space which is our space of functions.  \n\nGiven the values of any $C^2$ function $\\phi$ on the nodes $\\phi_k=\\phi(x_k,y_k)$, we can approximate $\\phi$ using an element of the Sobolev space as $\\phi(x,y)\\approx \\sum_{k}\\phi_k \\psi_k(x,y)$. By construction, this approximation agrees with the true function $\\phi$ on the nodes. The approximation can be improved by making the mesh finer.  Because these are second-order polynomials, the approximation should improve roughly cubically with the number of elements, assuming an evenly distributed mesh.\n\nNow let us describe how to solve the integral form of the linear equation above. We decompose the integrals as a sum of integrals on each element, and approximate all functions as functions on our Sobolev space.  Within each element, integrals and derivatives can be computed from second-order polynomials\\footnote{In practice, integrals are computed using Gaussian quadrature, and differentiation matrices are derived by differentiating the $\\psi_i(x,y)$ on each of the nodes.}.  If we take as a test function a basis function $\\psi_i$, the integral equation reduces to an equation of the form $\\sum_jA_{ij}\\delta\\phi_j=b_i$.  Over all basis functions, this defines a matrix $A_{ij}$ and a vector $b_i$, which gives a sparse linear algebraic system that can be solved using standard algorithms such as multifrontal methods. \n\nWe note that the nodes that lie on the boundary of the domain $D$ contribute to the boundary terms in the integral equation. The fact that the interior nodes have no such contribution is equivalent to requiring that outward-pointing normal derivatives cancel between adjacent elements. This enforces the continuity of the first derivatives of the functions in the fine mesh limit.  (Continuity of the functions themselves was already guaranteed by the piecewise construction of the Sobolev space.) This is why the second-derivative terms were integrated by parts in the integral equation. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n \\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{plot1}\\qquad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{plot2}\n\\caption{Plots of the solutions of the Liouville equation for each of the phases, at the triple point where all phases meet.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:convergence}, we show the convergence of this numerical method.  As a measure of error, we compute the area of the entire Riemann surface under the metric \\eqref{smet}.

Horizon lengths can be obtained from these parameters via \\label{eq:geoLengths}.  From each solution, we obtain the cycle lengths $\\ell_a$ of the A-cycles and B-cycles by numerically integrating $\\int_C e^\\phi $ along the curves  described in figure \\ref{SchottkyDomains}, which are geodesic from symmetry. This allows us to match the moduli of Schottky groups in different phases. We then compute the on-shell bulk action $I$ from the integrals in appendix \\ref{integrals}. Since the bulk saddles corresponding to connected and disconnected phases are related by the additional $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, there are two families of solutions we must find in order to complete the phase diagram.  One family allows us to obtain both the connected wormhole phase and the fully disconnected phase.  Each solution in this family will have one value of the action, but two different set of lengths $\\ell_a$, depending on which $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry is viewed as a time reflection symmetry.  The second family corresponds to the partially connected phases with AdS and a BTZ black hole.  \n\n\\section{Results for genus two}\n\\label{res}\n\nConsider first the subspace with cycle lengths $\\ell\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2=\\ell_3$, which has a ${\\mathbb{Z}}_3$ symmetry exchanging the boundaries. There are two phases respecting the full symmetry group, corresponding to connected and disconnected spacetimes, and we also consider a partially connected phase breaking the ${\\mathbb{Z}}_3$ symmetry.  We can directly restrict the parameters of our Schottky groups to this symmetry in the totally connected/disconnected families, though in the partially connected family it is not manifest which Schottky parameters correspond to equal cycle lengths, so we must scan the two-dimensional $\\ell_1=\\ell_2$ space of parameters and use interpolation to obtain actions and cycle lengths for the $\\ell\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2=\\ell_3$ family.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\textwidth]{actions.pdf}\n\t\\label{fig:actions} \n\t\\caption{Bulk action as a function of cycle lengths $\\ell\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2=\\ell_3$, normalised to that of the most symmetric surface $\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}\\equiv2\\log(2+\\sqrt 3)$.

At smaller lengths, the totally disconnected (three copies of AdS) phase is preferred (red in colour version), while for larger lengths, the connected wormhole is preferred (blue in colour version).  The phase transition between these occurs precisely at the length $\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}$. The AdS plus BTZ phase (black in colour version) is never dominant. All phases have a lower action than the non-handlebody phases ($I/c=0$.)}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:actions}, we plot the bulk action as a function of $\\ell$. We find that the AdS plus BTZ phase is never dominant.  At smaller lengths, the totally disconnected (three copies of AdS) phase is preferred, while for larger lengths, the connected wormhole is preferred.  The phase transition between these phases occurs for the maximally symmetric real Riemann surface where $\\ell=\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}=2\\log(2+\\sqrt 3)$, which corresponds to horizon sizes $\\lambda_{1,2,3}\\approx 7.30$, slightly larger than the $2\\pi$ horizon length corresponding to the Hawking-Page transition for the thermofield double.\n\nGeneralising to the two-dimensional family with $\\ell_{12}\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2$, all three phases we consider are dominant for some region of moduli space.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\textwidth]{phasediagram.pdf}\n\t\\caption{Phase diagram over cycle lengths $\\ell_{12}\\equiv\\ell_1=\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_3$, normalised to that of the most symmetric surface $\\ell_{\\mathrm{sym}}\\equiv2\\log(2+\\sqrt 3)$. The partially connected phase shown here connects the two $\\ell_1=\\ell_2$ cycles together.  The remaining partially connected phase is never dominant.\\label{fig:phasediagram}}\n\\end{figure}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:phasediagram}, we show the phase diagram of solutions in this family, as a function of the cycle lengths of the Riemann surface.  The phase boundaries are found using interpolation. We see that the disconnected phase is preferred whenever $\\ell_{12}$ is small, the partially connected phase (where boundaries with equal lengths are connected) is preferred whenever $\\ell_{12}$ is large and $\\ell_3$ is small, and the connected phase is preferred when all lengths are large. We also checked the handlebodies corresponding to a partially connected phase with the third boundary connected to one of the first two, which would break the symmetry swapping boundaries one and two (interpreted as time-reversal for the torus wormhole), finding they are never preferred.\nWe also find that all of these phases have an action below that of the non-handlebody solution (with $I=0$) throughout moduli space, though the subdominant solution appears to approach zero at the edges of moduli space.\n\nThe boundary between the connected and disconnected phases lies on the line of enhanced symmetry given by equation \\eqref{eq:conDiscTransition}, where the A- and B-cycles have equal sizes, though connected and disconnected solutions spontaneously break this symmetry. The phase boundary ends at the tricritical point, where the partially connected phase takes over, and the handlebody respects the symmetry, acting by swapping the two generators (demanding $\\alpha=\\hat{\\alpha}$ in the notation of the appendix).\n\nThe corresponding horizon sizes for the connected phase at the phase boundaries, determined by the Schottky parameters, are shown in figure \\ref{fig:horizonPhases}. In particular, along the phase transition between connected and disconnected phases, taking $\\ell_3\\to\\infty$, the third horizon $\\lambda_3$ in the connected phase is large but the lengths $\\lambda_{12}$ of the two equal horizons approach $2\\pi$ from above.  \n\nAt the phase boundary between the connected and partially connected phase (see lower left plot of figure \\ref{fig:horizonPhases}), we find the striking result that the horizon length $\\lambda_3$ of the connected phase is $\\lambda_3\\approx 6.283$, agreeing with $2\\pi$ to high accuracy (to around one part in $10^4$ at the triple point), along the entire phase boundary.  A similar agreement with $2\\pi$ appears in the partially connected phase as well, where the length of a geodesic circling in the Euclidean time (homotopic to the third B-cycle) agrees with $2\\pi$ to a similar accuracy.  Swapping A- and B-cycles to reinterpret this as the disconnected/partially connected phase boundary, this geodesic becomes the horizon of the BTZ part of the partially connected geometry, so the transition from partially connected to disconnected appears for approximately the same BTZ horizon size as the Hawking-Page transition.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.7\\textwidth]{horizons1}\\vspace{1cm}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.41\\textwidth]{horizonPhases}\\qquad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.42\\textwidth]{horizons2}\n\t\\caption{The horizon lengths in the connected phase at the boundaries where it meets the other phases. The upper plot shows $\\lambda_{12}$ (blue) and $\\lambda_3$ (red) as a function of the cycle length $\\ell_3$, along the boundary with the disconnected phase; in the shaded part to the left of the dashed line, the partially connected phase is dominant. The lower left diagram shows the horizon lengths at which the connected phase becomes subdominant to the other phases, so the allowed horizon lengths in this phase are in the region in the top right, bounded by the solid lines. The lower right diagram shows the BTZ horizon length $\\lambda_\\text{BTZ}$ in the partially connected phase where it transitions to the connected phase with horizon lengths $\\lambda_{12}$ (and $\\lambda_3\\approx 2\\pi$, not shown); these have physical interpretations as the entropy of boundaries 1 and 2 either side of the transition. In the lower diagrams, dashed curves indicate where the two phases involved in the transition are both subdominant to the third phase.\\label{fig:horizonPhases}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn terms of the torus wormhole, the interpretation of these results is that the black hole phase is dominant roughly when both the internal cycles of the torus have length of at least $2\\pi$. In particular, the minimal horizon length, occurring for the square torus at the triple point, is at $\\lambda\\approx 22.3$, much greater than the Hawking-Page value.\n\nOn more careful investigation, this phase transition does not correspond to horizon sizes of \\emph{exactly} $2\\pi$, except perhaps in the limit $\\ell_{12}\\to\\infty$ at the edge of moduli space. We checked this by setting the various $\\lambda$'s in question to $2\\pi$ and scanning the resulting one-parameter families of solutions.  We find that for sufficiently small $\\ell_{12}$, these lines do not have matching cycle lengths, though the deviations quickly become very small as $\\ell_{12}$ increases.  In particular, this implies that if the connected/partially connected phase boundary were extended much farther into the region where the disconnected phase is dominant, then the horizon lengths will show appreciable deviations from $2\\pi$. The lack of matching is particularly obvious in the limit $\\ell_{12}\\to 0$, as one of the proposed families has $\\ell_3\\to\\infty$ while for the other $\\ell_3$ remains finite in the limit. We do not yet have an explanation for why the lengths approximate $2\\pi$ so well for such a large range of parameters. \n\nFinally, we compared our numerical results with the pinching limits analytically obtained in section \\ref{sec:pinching}. The numerics becomes difficult for small cycle lengths, due to a large separation of scales in the domain, so this check is not very precise, though we find good agreement. For example, taking the pinching limit $\\ell_3\\to0$ along the line separating disconnected and partially connected phases, a fit of the action to a function $-A \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\ell_3^{-p}+C$ using 64 data points with $0.76\\lesssim \\ell_3 \\lesssim 1$ gives parameters $p\\approx 1.03, A\\approx .99$. Data for this pinching limit is shown in figure \\ref{pinchData}, plotted against $-\\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\ell_3}+C$ with a one-parameter fit of the additive constant.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{pinchData1}\\quad\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{pinchData2}\n\t\\caption{The action at the phase transition between partially connected and disconnected phases, compared with the analytic result $I/c=-\\frac{\\pi^2}{6\\ell_3}$ in the $\\ell_3\\to0$ limit (dashed curve).

The right plot shows the same data on a log-log scale.\\label{pinchData}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nA Riemann surface of genus $g \\geq 1$ can be described by Schottky uniformisation as a region in the complex plane with identified boundaries. This Schottky uniformisation description can be extended to a quotient of $\\mathbb H^3$, giving a handlebody solution in a Euclidean bulk, holographically dual to the field theory on the Riemann surface. A given Riemann surface has infinitely many Schottky uniformisations; from the bulk perspective these correspond to different handlebodies, characterised by the choice of boundary cycles which become contractible in the bulk. The geometry of least action dominates in the calculation of the partition function. \n\nIn \\cite{Krasnov:2000zq}, the calculation of the action of the bulk handlebodies was reduced to the calculation of the Takhtajan-Zograf action \\cite{TZ} for a boundary Liouville field, describing the conformal map from the flat metric on the complex plane to the chosen metric on the Riemann surface. We have shown how, choosing a canonical constant negative curvature metric, this Liouville field may be computed numerically using finite element methods, and the Takhtajan-Zograf action evaluated. Apart from the importance for holographic studies, the solution for the Liouville field may be of some mathematical interest. \n\nWe explicitly calculated the action for some bulk handlebody solutions in a two-dimensional subspace of the moduli space of genus two Riemann surfaces with three commuting reflection symmetries. Restricting to handlebodies preserving these symmetries allows us to consider finitely many solutions, three in this case. These surfaces have two distinct interpretations as preparing Lorentzian states on the circles of reflection symmetry: they give a state in three copies of the CFT, or a state in a single copy of the CFT. In the first interpretation, the Lorentzian analogues of the handlebodies we consider are a three-boundary wormhole, a totally disconnected space, and a two-boundary wormhole plus a disconnected space. In the second, they are two different versions of pure AdS and a single-exterior black hole with a torus behind the horizon. We also compared these solutions to a non-handlebody solution obtained as the quotient of a Euclidean wormhole. \n\nWe compared the actions for these different solutions and determined the dominant solution as a function of the two moduli. We confirmed the accuracy of the numerical results by comparing to analytic expectations at special values of the moduli, and in pinching limits at the boundary of the moduli space. There is a line in the moduli space with a $\\mathbb Z_3$ symmetry; along this line, we found that the $\\mathbb Z_3$ symmetric saddles dominated, and there is a Hawking-Page like phase transition between the connected and disconnected phases. However, along another line in the moduli space with an enhanced $\\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, preserved by the partially connected phase but not the others, the symmetric phase does not always dominate. The full phase diagram is given in figure \\ref{fig:phasediagram}. The handlebodies always dominate over the non-handlebody solution. \n\nOur results largely confirm previous expectations, but it is worth noting that symmetric solutions are not always dominant over those which spontaneously break the symmetry. This is similar to the square torus, the critical surface at the Hawking-Page phase transition, with a similar extra symmetry spontaneously broken by both dominant phases, although in that case there exists no handlebody that respects the full symmetry group of the boundary. It would be interesting to understand which symmetries are always preserved and which may be spontaneously broken. We should note that an important class of symmetries, which have interpretations as time-reversal ($\\epsilon=0$ type real structures, in the language of section \\ref{surf}), are found never to be broken in our examples, given the phases we have checked. Such a symmetry breaking would make semiclassical Lorentzian interpretation of the dual geometry more difficult, since there would be no natural $t=0$ slice on which to define the Hartle-Hawking state. Furthermore, if all such symmetries are preserved, it implies that there is no breaking of replica symmetry in calculations of R\\'enyi entropies (at least for time-reversal invariant states and subsystems), since the dihedral replica symmetry group can be generated by such reflections.\n\nWe found that along the boundaries separating the partially connected phase from the others, certain horizon lengths approach $2\\pi$ at the edges of moduli space, and this remains a very good approximation well into the centre of moduli space. It would be interesting to analytically understand these edges of moduli space, including the corrections to explain why the approximation remains good in a regime na\\\"ively so far from the limit. This would no doubt be useful for more general Riemann surfaces, and since the approximation is valid in such a wide parameter range there is more hope for good analytic understanding than one might have expected. A direct CFT calculation may also be tractable in such limits, giving an interpretion of the phases as dominance of the vacuum Virasoro block propagating in certain cycles.\n\nAn obvious avenue for future work is to extend to higher genus, where an increased number of boundaries allows for a richer multiparty entanglement structure. It is in fact possible to deduce results at higher genus for some special moduli already without further work via a trick, whereby we may extend a pair of pants decomposition of a surface into the bulk, cutting certain handles of a handlebody, and getting the action for each solid pair of pants from the genus 2 results. This is usually not possible because the cutoff surface chosen (or equivalently the Liouville field) depends on the surface globally, and this affects the action of each component. However, if the cycles we cut along are fixed by a reflection symmetry, the cutoff in each pair of pants component is identical to the cutoff for half the genus two surface, so the action can be found. In terms of the Schottky domain, this is manifested by the domain $D$ being divided into pairs of pants bounded by geodesics (at known locations fixed by symmetries), which allows solution of the Liouville equation without reference to the identifications used. As a simple example of the sort of result that  can be deduced from this idea, the four boundary wormhole with equally sized boundaries arranged to have the symmetries of a square (boundaries lying in a plane, one at each vertex of the square, roughly speaking) has a transition from connected to disconnected phases at horizon sizes $\\lambda\\approx 7.62$.\n\n One application of the results is to see what the phase structure implies for the possible structure of entanglement in these states. For example, a phase transition may prevent the moduli from ever exhibiting intrinsically $n$-party entanglement in the sense of \\cite{Balasubramanian:2014hda}, or, more generally, may restrict the entropy cone of \\cite{Bao:2015bfa}. The reason for this is that choosing horizon sizes large enough to be above the phase transition may imply that every hyperbolic surface has another internal cycle short enough to enter a Ryu-Takayanagi calculation. For example, taking the four boundary wormhole with the symmetries of a square as in the previous paragraph, the internal moduli are relevant for horizon sizes $\\lambda \\gtrsim 2.12$, far below the phase transition point deduced above.\n \n It would also be interesting to check whether geodesics that leave the constant time slice can ever be short enough to dominate the entanglement entropy, as discussed in \\cite{Maxfield:2014kra}, where for the torus this possibility was shown to be prevented only by the phase structure.\n \n\n\\paragraph{Acknowledgements}\nIt is a pleasure to thank Alex Maloney for helpful discussions.

The reverse orientation of a curve is indicated by a sign.  \n\nIf one of the curves bounds $D$ from the outside on the $w$ plane, so the fundamental domain is bounded, we can write the Takhtajan-Zograf action as\n\n", "index": 57, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\tI_{TZ}[\\phi] =& \\int_D \\frac{i}{2} {\\mathrm{d}} w \\wedge {\\mathrm{d}}\\bar{w} \\;  \\left(4\\partial \\phi \\bar{\\partial} \\phi +e^{2\\phi}\\right) \\\\\n\t  &+\\sum_k \\int_{C_k} \\left(2\\phi -\\frac{1}{2}\\log |L'_k|^2 -\\log|c_k|^2\\right) \\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\frac{L''_k}{L'_k} d w - \\frac{\\bar{L}''_k}{\\bar{L}'_k} d\\bar{w} \\right) \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E29.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle I_{TZ}[\\phi]=\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Z</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi/></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E29.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\int_{D}\\frac{i}{2}{\\mathrm{d}}w\\wedge{\\mathrm{d}}\\bar{w}\\;\\left(%&#10;4\\partial\\phi\\bar{\\partial}\\phi+e^{2\\phi}\\right)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mi>D</mi></msub></mstyle><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>d</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2227</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>w</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mo>\u2202</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle+\\sum_{k}\\int_{C_{k}}\\left(2\\phi-\\frac{1}{2}\\log|L^{\\prime}_{k}|^%&#10;{2}-\\log|c_{k}|^{2}\\right)\\frac{i}{2}\\left(\\frac{L^{\\prime\\prime}_{k}}{L^{%&#10;\\prime}_{k}}dw-\\frac{\\bar{L}^{\\prime\\prime}_{k}}{\\bar{L}^{\\prime}_{k}}d\\bar{w}\\right)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>k</mi></munder></mstyle><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></msub></mstyle><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msubsup><mi>L</mi><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><msubsup><mi>L</mi><mi>k</mi><mi>\u2032\u2032</mi></msubsup><msubsup><mi>L</mi><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>w</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>L</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>k</mi><mi>\u2032\u2032</mi></msubsup><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>L</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>w</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00980.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere again the sum runs over all $k$ such that $w_\\infty\\neq\\infty$.\n\nWhen $C_k$ is a circle, the final boundary integral independent of $\\phi$ can be explicitly evaluated in terms of the geometry.

The reflection in the equatorial plane, corresponding to the time-reflection for the three boundary wormhole in the connected phase, maps each circle to itself, but flipped. The reflection swapping $C_1 \\leftrightarrow C_1'$ and $C_2 \\leftrightarrow C_2'$ corresponds to time reflection when the bulk is reinterpreted as the three boundary wormhole in the disconnected phase. The final reflection, being the time-reversal for the torus wormhole, swaps $C_1 \\leftrightarrow C_2$ and $C_1' \\leftrightarrow C_2'$. Relaxing the assumption of this final symmetry would allow us to describe the full three-parameter space of three-boundary wormholes by having different radii for the pairs $C_1,C_1'$ and $C_2,C_2'$. We stereographically project this sphere to the $w$-plane in such a way that the equator maps to the real axis, and the symmetries act as reflection in the axes and inversion in the unit circle, which we denote by $C$.
