subsequent rise and rupture of this large bubble plays an important role in aerosol formation\nand gas transport at the air-sea interface.\nThe large bubble is formed when the impact crater closes up near the pool surface and is known to occur\nonly for drops which are prolate at impact.\nHerein we use experiments and numerical simulations to show that a concentrated vortex ring,\nproduced in the neck between the drop and pool, controls the crater deformations and pinch-off.\nHowever, it is not the strongest vortex rings which are responsible for the large bubbles,\nas they interact too strongly with the pool surface and self-destruct.\nRather, it is somewhat weaker vortices which can deform the deeper craters, which manage to pinch off the large bubbles.\nThese observations also explain why the strongest and most penetrating vortex rings emerging from drop impacts, are not produced by oblate drops\nbut by more prolate drop shapes, as had been observed in previous experiments.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nWhen a liquid drop impacts onto a liquid pool, it can entrap air bubbles of different sizes\n\\cite{Esmailizadeh1986, Prosperetti1989, Oguz1989, Oguz1990, Prosperetti1993, Rein1993, Thoroddsen2003, Smith2003, Korobkin2008, Lee2011, Saylor2012, Thoroddsen2012, Ray2012, Tran2013, Semenov2013, Ray2015, Semenov2015, Beilharz2015, Murphy2015}.\nWhile the smallest bubbles can dissolve, contributing to the gas transfer into the pool \\cite{Esmailizadeh1986},\nthe largest bubbles rise to the surface where they burst.\nThe latter mechanism can produce many smaller bubbles \\cite{Bird2010} and aerosols in the atmosphere \\cite{Lee2011, Lhuissier2012, Wilson2015}.\nDifferent mechanisms have been identified, responsible for air entrapment \\cite{Liow2007}.\nThe recent progress in high-speed video imaging has allowed researchers to explain some aspects of bubble entrapment \\cite{Thoroddsen2012},\nand even discover new mechanisms \\cite{Thoraval2012, Castrejon-Pita2012, Thoraval2013}.\n\nHere we focus on the so-called \\textit{large bubble entrainment} identified by Pumphrey and Elmore \\cite{Pumphrey1990}.\nThey observed  that for a small range of water drop diameters and impact velocities,\nthe cavity produced by the drop expands radially below the pool surface and closes at the top to entrap a large bubble.\nThey already suggested that the drop shape oscillations play an important role in this entrapment.\nZou \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Zou2012} have recently reported a similar large bubble entrapment for horizontally restricted pools.\nThey determined that such bubbles were observed only for prolate drops, i.e. those with a larger vertical extent.\nFinally, Wang, Kuan and Tsai \\cite{Wang2013} have shown that the large bubble entrapment on unrestricted pools also occurs only for prolate drops,\nand over a wider range of conditions than originally observed \\cite{Pumphrey1990}.\n\nHowever, the underlying mechanism for this large bubble entrapment has remained a mystery until now.\nWe combine herein high-speed imaging and numerical simulations to show\nthe crucial role played by vorticity in deforming the interface and entrapping the large bubble.\nThe role of vorticity in this process has been ignored in the above studies.\nIt is indeed only recently that the effects of vorticity on drop-impact splashing have been demonstrated\n\\cite{Thoraval2012, Castrejon-Pita2012, Thoraval2013, Agbaglah2015, Lee2015}.\n\n\\section{Experimental setup}\n\nWe use drops pinched off from a nozzle and impacting on a pool surface.\nWe adjust the impact velocity by varying the impact height $H$.\nBy using slightly different liquids in the drop and the pool, the difference in refractive index\nreveals the deformation of the interface between the two liquids,\nwhile keeping the main features of the flow unchanged (see Section~\\ref{sec:Other}).\nFig.~\\ref{fig:LBexperiments} shows such a case. The first image shows the presence of a strong vortex ring,\nmade visible by the roll-up of the liquid-liquid interface.\nThe vorticity is produced by the flow around the curved free surface during the early dynamics \\cite[p. 366]{Batchelor1967},\nand has been the subject of many studies \\cite{Thomson1885, Chapman1967, Rodriguez1988, Rein1993, Peck1994, Cresswell1995, Dooley1997, Peck1998b, Josserand2003, Saylor2004, Watanabe2008, Li2008, Santini2013, Moore2014},\nas will be discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:discussion}.\nIn the following images, the air-liquid interface is pulled around and towards the core of the vortex,\nfirst radially outwards in the third frame, then upwards in the fourth frame.\nThis creates a tongue of liquid above the cavity, pulled towards the center by surface tension,\nwhich finally closes to entrap the large bubble.\nThe pulling on the interface can be explained by the lower pressure at the core of the vortex and the velocity field around it \\cite{Yu1990, Jha2015}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Figure_01_1mm}\n  \\caption{Side view imaging of a prolate drop impacting into a pool ($D

frame).\n\tThe dark region is the air cavity created by the impacting drop.\n\tThe scale bar is 1~mm long.}\n  \\label{fig:LBexperiments}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Numerical simulations}\n\nWe perform numerical simulations to understand the effect of the different parameters on the vorticity dynamics.\nWe use the \\textit{Gerris} code \\cite{Popinet2003, Popinet2009},\nvalidated in previous studies on drop impact \\cite{Thoraval2012, Thoraval2013}.\nIt solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a \\textit{Volume-of-Fluid} method for the two-phase flow and a dynamic adaptive grid refinement.\n\nWe simulate the axisymmetric impact of a water drop onto a water pool initially at rest, including gravity.\nA passive tracer is initially placed into the drop (colored in red) to identify the origin of the water,\nin a similar way as in the experiment in Fig.~\\ref{fig:LBexperiments}.\nThe main tracer used to follow the air-water interface is not affected by this additional tracer.\n\nThe use of numerical simulations allows a precise control of the drop shape, independently of the impact velocity.\nWe compare here the impact of a spherical drop to ellipsoids of revolution.\nThe equivalent drop diameter is defined as $D = \\left(D_h^2 D_v\\right)^{1/3}$,\nwith horizontal diameter $D_h$ ($a = D_h/D$) and vertical diameter $D_v$ ($b = D_v/D$).\nThe vertical diameter is obtained by volume conservation: $b=  1/a^2$.\nThe simulation starts before the drop touches the pool,\nwith a uniform vertical drop impact velocity $V$.\n\nIn the axisymmetric domain of size 1, the drop has a radius of 0.13 and the pool depth is 2.5$D$.\nThe mesh is refined near the air/water interface, the passive tracer interface\nand in the regions of high vorticity, at a maximum refinement level of 11,\ncorresponding to the smallest cells of size $2^{-11}$ ($ D / \\delta x = 532$).\nSome numerical details are given in Thoraval~\\textit{et al.} \\cite{Thoraval2012}.\nOnly at the upper boundary of the parameter regime do we see some effect of increasing resolution (see Supplemental Material \\cite{SM}).\nThis would benefit from even higher level of mesh refinement but is prohibitive due to the long duration of the entrapment process,\nespecially compared to the first ejecta studied in \\cite{Thoraval2012}, were such super-resolution simulations are feasible.\n\nAll * variables are non-dimensionalized with $D$ and $V$, including $t^{*} = t / \\tau$, with $\\tau = D/V$.\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble} shows a typical time evolution leading to the large bubble entrapment,\nfor a prolate drop under conditions similar to Fig.~\\ref{fig:LBexperiments}.\nDespite the use of different liquids in the experiments, and the uncertainty on the drop shape,\nthe simulation captures very well the dynamics,\nincluding the rectangular shape of the bubble after pinch-off, and the vertical jet in the center.\nWe see clearly the early shedding of vorticity on the side of the drop (inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}b),\nhidden in experiments because of the curved interface above the pool surface, but visible by x-rays \\cite{Agbaglah2015}.\nThe side vortex ring then rolls-up with the trailing vortex sheet into a larger vortex ring,\nthat pulls radially on the interface below the surface of the pool (see Supplemental Videos \\cite{SM}).\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=5.25in]{largeBubbleSequence-inset}\n  \\caption{Typical time sequence leading to large bubble

vorticity field.}\n  \\label{fig:largeBubble}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Role of gravity}\n\nWhat is the role of gravity in this entrapment process?\nThis can be directly addressed in the numerical simulations, where we can simply turn gravity off.\nThe typical Froude number $Fr = V/\\sqrt{gD}$ is rather low ($Fr = $~4.5 in Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}).\nGravity can therefore be neglected during the initial impact of the drop ($t^{*} \\leq 1$),\nbut may affect the dynamics at later times. This is indeed what is observed.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:largeBubble-nog} shows that the large bubble entrapment still occurs, even if gravity is removed.\nThe sequences show no significant differences up to the time of entrainment of the bubble.\nOnly in the last image, at time $t^{*} = $~4.8, does gravity influence the bottom shape of the bubble.\nGravity is therefore not responsible for the large bubble entrapment.\n\nIn contrast, gravity plays a key role in the regular bubble entrainment,\nwhich is produced at the bottom of the collapsing impact crater \\cite{Prosperetti1989, Oguz1990, Chen2014}\nand is greatly affected by the hydrostatic pressure.\nThis was also verified with our simulations as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:regularEntrainment}.\nRegular entrainment, by pinch-off of the bottom of the crater, is no longer observed if gravity is removed.\n\nThis difference is consistent with the different time scales of these entrainment mechanisms.\nThe large bubble entrapment occurs at $t^{*} \\sim 3$ (see Figs.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}, \\ref{fig:entrapmentTZ}a),\nwhile the regular entrapment is observed at longer times\n($t^{*} \\simeq 5.6$ in our simulations, or 9.4 in \\cite[their Fig.~4]{Pumphrey1990}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{largeBubbleSequence-nog}\n  \\caption{Influence of gravity on the large-bubble

\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Parameter space}\n\nWe explore the effect of the impact velocity $V$, drop diameter $D$ and drop shape on the large bubble entrapment.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:entrapment}(a) shows the $D$-$V$ parameter space where large bubbles are entrapped (\\textcolor{green}{$\\blacktriangle$}).\nFor all cases in the figure, we have simulated 5 different drop shapes\nwith horizontal diameter $a = D_h/D$ values of 0.9, 0.95, 1, 1.05 and 1.1.\nLarge bubble entrapment occurs only for the largest vertical elongation of the drop (the most prolate), i.e. $a = 0.9$,\nin the parameter range reported in Fig.~\\ref{fig:entrapment}(a).\nThe goal of this study is to understand the underlying mechanism of the large bubble entrapment,\nrather than mapping an extensive parameter space.\nBy comparing here drops with the same volume and impact velocity,\nwe are able to confirm the crucial effect of the drop shape, as previously suggested.\nThe parameter space is consistent with the experiments of Wang \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Wang2013},\nshowing similar lower and upper limits on both axis.\nThe less clear upper limit in impact velocity ($V \\simeq 1.6$~m/s) is probably due to insufficient numerical refinement\nfor such high Reynolds number ($Re = \\rho D V / \\mu = 8000$),\nas was demonstrated by the very high refinement needed in the study of Thoraval \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Thoraval2012},\nwhen capturing the details of the earliest contact.\nKeep in mind that our regime of (\\textcolor{green}{$\\blacktriangle$}) is continuous,\nwhereas in experiments, the prolate phase of the pinched-off oscillating drop\nis restricted to certain discrete release heights and thereby impact velocities \\cite{Wang2013, Thoraval2013}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{entrapment_vert}\n  \\caption{(a) Parameter space where a large bubble is entrapped (\\textcolor{green}{$\\blacktriangle$}) or not (\\textcolor{red}{$\\CIRCLE$}).\n\tAll simulations are for a prolate water drop with horizontal axis $a= D_h/D = 0.9$.\n\tNo large bubble entrapment was observed for other drop aspect ratios when $a$ in 0.95, 1, 1.05 and 1.1.\n\t(b) Equivalent spherical diameter of the large air bubble $D_b$,\n\tbased on its total volume and normalized by the drop diameter ($D_b^* = D_b/D$), for $D =$~5~mm and $a =$~0.9.}\n  \\label{fig:entrapment}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe size of the large bubble increases with the impact velocity (Fig.~\\ref{fig:entrapment}b),\nexcept for the last point, which lies at the limit of the entrapment region.\nThe bubble diameter is 20 to 75\\% larger than the drop.\nFor the highest impact velocities these simulation numbers are still sensitive to refinement level.\nThis trend is consistent with the experiments of Zou~\\textit{et al.} \\cite{Zou2012}, although their study was on a horizontally confined pool.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{entrapmentTZ_vert}\n  \\caption{Time (a) and depth (b) of the large bubble entrapment.\n\tIt is defined as the point where the liquid tongue first touches the opposite symmetrical liquid tongue\n\ton the axis of symmetry above the air cavity.\n\tThe zero in depth (b) is set at the initial pool surface.}\n  \\label{fig:entrapmentTZ}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe top enclosure and entrapment occurs in most cases at $t^{*} \\simeq 3.3$\nwith a couple of the higher-velocity impacts closing in shorter time $\\simeq 2.8$ (Fig.~\\ref{fig:entrapmentTZ}a).\nThis is consistent with Fig.~\\ref{fig:LBexperiments} ($t^{*} \\simeq 3.2$),\nand previous observations ($t^{*} \\simeq 3.5$ in \\cite{Pumphrey1990} and 2.7 in \\cite{Zou2012}).\nThe bubble closes below the original pool surface, at about one drop radius in depth (Fig.~\\ref{fig:entrapmentTZ}b).\n\n\n\\subsection{Vortex pulling}\n\nTo understand the mechanism responsible for the large bubble entrapment,\nwe focus from here on one typical impact condition ($D =$~5~mm, $V =$~1~m/s), and change the drop shape.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:compareTauv}, gives a clear indication of the role of the drop shape in the large bubble entrapment.\nIt changes the strength and dynamics of the vortex ring and its interaction with the interface.\nThe relevant time scale for the drop entry time into the pool and the early formation of the cavity\nis $\\tau_{v} = D_{v}/V = \\tau / a^2$.\nBy comparing the impact for five different drop shapes at the same non-dimensional time $t/\\tau_v$, we observe that\nthe vortex pulls on the interface and self-destructs earlier for the flatter drop (larger $a$).\nIt can therefore not pull on the interface to produce the large bubble.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{compareTauv2}\n  \\caption{Effect of drop shape on the vortex interaction with the free surface: $D =$~5~mm, $V =$~1~m/s,\n  over a range of aspect ratios from left to right $a =$~0.9, 0.95, 1, 1.05 and 1.1, which are shown in the insets (not to scale).\n\tFirst row: interface shapes at a fixed time $t/\\tau_v = 0.72$.\n\tMiddle row: vorticity in the liquid at the same time.\n\tBottom row: interface shapes shown at a later time $t^{*} = 5.72$.\n\tThe scale bars are 0.5~$D$ long.}\n  \\label{fig:compareTauv}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThis can be further analyzed by tracking the strongest vortex ring shed into the pool (Fig.~\\ref{fig:Vorticity}),\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}(b) and the second row of Fig.~\\ref{fig:compareTauv}.\nThe time when the vortex ring strongly pulls on the interface can be identified in its trajectory,\nwhen it moves together with the deformed interface. This shows the vortex move rapidly radially outwards,\nand then being deflected upwards, forming a characteristic hump in Figure~\\ref{fig:Vorticity}(b).\nAs a consequence of this pulling, a tongue of the interface penetrates into the vortex ring,\nleading to a sharp decrease of its intensity (Fig.~\\ref{fig:Vorticity}a).\nThis also helps promote an inward motion, above the vortex, in the case of large bubble entrapment (starting from the \\textbf{+} on the curve).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Vorticity}\n  \\caption{Time evolution of the vorticity maximum in the main vortex ring shed behind the neck (a),\n\tand its location (b), starting near the center and then moving outwards radially.\n\t(c) \\& (d) show the time evolutions of the

$~1.80 (fifth panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}).}\n  \\label{fig:Vorticity}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe surface pulling occurs later for more prolate drops, which confirms the previous observation from Fig.~\\ref{fig:compareTauv}.\nFor $a = 0.9$, it even occurs for $t/\\tau_V > 1$.\nThe location of the pulling is also very different.\nFor the flattest drop ($a = 1.1$) it occurs above the pool surface, while for $a = 0.9$ it is lower than $-D/3$.\nThis changes the curvature and orientation of the interface where the vortex pulls, leading to different crater structures.\nFor the oblate drop, the vortex starts to pull on the side of the drop before it has fully entered the pool.\nThe resulting liquid protrusion is thinner and more vertical, and therefore is rapidly pulled back by surface tension.\nIn contrast, the prolate drop pulls on the interface below the pool surface,\non the side of the cavity created by the impacting drop (fifth panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}).\nThe thicker and more horizontal liquid tongue is thus able to collapse on the central axis to entrap the large bubble.\n\n\\subsection{Vortex dynamics}\n\nTo understand how the shape of the drop changes so drastically the time and location of the pulling,\nwe need to analyze the earlier dynamics of the vortex ring.\nFirst, we observe that a more oblate drop produces a stronger vortex ring (Fig.~\\ref{fig:Vorticity}a).\nThis is due to a geometrical effect: when a flatter drop meets the pool surface, the neck shape forms a sharper cusp\nthan for a circular or prolate drop.\nA stronger curvature will produce stronger vorticity (see section~\\ref{sec:discussion}).\nThen, we also observe that the dynamics of the vortex ring changes with the drop shape.\nAlthough the vortex rings closely follows the neck in the radial direction in all cases\nup to $t/\\tau_v = 0.5$ (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:VorticityRt} \\cite{SM}), the dynamics is different in the vertical direction.\nThe vortex ring separates from the interface earlier for more prolate drops (Fig.~\\ref{fig:Vorticity}d).\n\nThese two effects both contribute to the delayed pulling of the vortex ring on the interface for the prolate drop,\nleading to the large bubble entrapment.\nAs the vortex is weaker and further away from the interface in that case, it exerts a smaller force on the interface.\nIt is therefore able to move deeper into the pool before pulling on the interface.\n\nThis explains why the pulling of the interface occurs later for prolate drops,\nonly when the opening cavity brings again the interface closer to the vortex.\nIt also explains why the vortex ring is able to generates a stronger vortical flow, as it is further away from the interface.\nThe key role of the vorticity shedding in the dynamics of drop impacts was first observed in Thoraval~\\textit{et al.} \\cite{Thoraval2012},\nand further studied in \\cite{Moore2014, Agbaglah2015, Lee2015}.\nHowever, the complex process of vorticity production and separation from the free surface is still not fully understood.\nThis study brings another contribution to this problem, showing the effect of the drop shape on the vorticity shedding.\n\nThe earlier vorticity shedding for more prolate drops is probably due to\nthe faster vertical motion of the sharp interface point on the side of the drop\n(wider angle between the drop and the pool).\nAs the liquid from the pool moves faster vertically on the side of the drop (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}),\nthe corner where vorticity is generated is pushed against the dominant downwards velocity, thus promoting vorticity shedding.\n\n\n\\subsection{Energy and momentum}\n\nTo understand the effect of the vortex on the larger-scale dynamics,\nwe can decompose the kinetic energy and momentum in the radial and vertical directions (Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ek}).\nThe radial (resp. vertical) kinetic energy $EK_R$ (resp. $EK_Z$) is defined as the volume integral over the whole domain of\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_R^2$ (resp. $\\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_Z^2$), where $V_R$ (resp. $V_Z$) is the radial (resp. vertical) component of the velocity.\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum of the two for this axisymmetric simulation: $EK = EK_R + EK_Z$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{EkRZ_vert}\n  \\caption{Kinetic energy $EK$ in radial (a) and vertical (b) directions,\n\tnormalized by the initial kinetic energy of the drop.\nThe total combined kinetic energy is shown in Supplementary Figure~\\ref{fig:EK} \\cite{SM}.}\n  \\label{fig:Ek}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe dominant energy in the impact is the kinetic energy, while the initial surface and potential energy\nrepresent only 17\\% and 10\\% respectively for the typical case studied here.\nThe surface energy of the ellipsoidal shapes is larger than the one of the spherical drop, as it is the minimal surface.\nHowever, for the shapes studied here, the surface energy changes by less than 1.7\\%,\nand therefore less than 0.3\\% of the initial kinetic energy.\nThis difference can therefore be neglected.\nThe kinetic energy is initially only vertical, and the radial kinetic energy is produced as the drop enters the pool.\n\nWe also normalize the time by $\\tau_{v}$ based on the vertical diameter,\nas it is the relevant time scale at which the energy is transferred from the impacting drop to the pool.\nEven in this rescaled time frame, the release of vertical kinetic energy\nis initially slower for the drops with a larger vertical extension.\nThis can be understood by an added mass effect, as the resistance from the pool will be lower\nfor the drops showing a smaller horizontal extent perpendicular to the impact direction.\nHowever, this tendency is later reversed, so that all cases reach a similar\nvertical kinetic energy around $t/\\tau_{v} \\geq 1.5$.\n\nFrom $t/\\tau_{v} \\geq 0.75$ until the pulling time of the vortex on the interface,\nthe radial kinetic energy is larger for the prolate drop (Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ek}a).\nHowever, the outwards radial momentum is still lower (Fig.~\\ref{fig:MR}a).\nThe larger kinetic energy therefore reveals a stronger inward velocity towards the axis of symmetry,\nas the dominant radial flow is away from the center.\nThis shows that although the vortex for the prolate drop is initially weaker,\nit is able to generate a stronger large-scale rotational motion in the flow,\nbeneficial for the closure of the liquid tongue above the large bubble.\nIn contrast, the stronger vortex for the oblate drop self-destructs earlier by pulling on the interface,\nstopping the development of the vortical flow.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{MR25_vert}\n\t\\caption{Radial component of the momentum $M_R$,\n\tnormalized by the norm of the initial vertical momentum of the drop.\n\tThe dotted lines in (b) correspond to the cases where gravity has been removed.}\n\t\\label{fig:MR}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFinally, Fig.~\\ref{fig:MR}(b) shows that the radial momentum starts decreasing strongly after $t^{*} \\simeq 2$,\nnon-dimensionalized by $\\tau = D/V$, based on the equivalent diameter of the drop.\nThis is characteristic of the reversing flow due to gravity towards the axis of symmetry,\nas confirmed by the comparison with the same cases without gravity.\nGravity starts playing a significant role from that time, as shown by the large deviation of the dotted curves.\n\nThis reversing flow is probably beneficial for the liquid tongue to close the cavity and entrap the large bubble.\nAs the interface pulling occurs later for the prolate drop (also in the rescaled time with $\\tau_{v} = D_v/V$),\nit is closer to the time when the liquid flows back toward the axis.\nHowever, even without the effect of gravity, the radial momentum still shows a sharp decrease\njust before the large bubble entrapment.\nIt therefore shows that the closure of the liquid tongue above the cavity\nis mostly driven by surface tension, after the strong decrease of radial expansion by the vortical flow.\n\n\n\\subsection{Other experimental conditions}\n\\label{sec:Other}\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:LBexperiments} uses 10.5\\% $MgSO_4$ in the water drop\nto introduce a strong index-of-refraction difference between the drop and the pool liquids,\nto allow us to visualize clearly their interface and identify vortex structures.\nThis also introduces a density difference $\\rho_d / \\rho_p =$ 1.105 and viscosity difference,\nwhere the drop liquid is 1.95 times more viscous than the distilled water in the pool.\nHowever, in the numerical simulations, both liquids are modeled with water properties.\nTo quantify possible effects of the difference in properties,\nwe performed another set of experiments with about half the salt concentration,\ni.e. for 6\\% $MgSO_4$.  Figure~\\ref{Fig_S1} shows that the overall entrapment of a large bubble\nis the same as for the higher salt concentration.\nThis suggests that the density difference between the drop and pool does not significantly change the\nlarge-bubble entrapment dynamics.\nThe lower concentration reduces the contrast in the imaging.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{6perMgSO4_H5cm_1mm}\n  \\caption{Large bubble entrapment for a drop of 6\\% $MgSO_4$, giving $\\rho_d / \\rho_p =$~1.06 and $\\mu_d =$~1.3~cP.\n\tfor $D=$5.0 mm and $V=$~0.94~m/s, $H=$~5.0~cm.\n  The sequence shows the following times: -2.3, 7, 11, 17, 25~ms after the first contact.\n\tThe scale bar is 1~mm long.}\n  \\label{Fig_S1}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigures~\\ref{Fig_S2}(a) shows the entrapment dynamics for a prolate drop with the same liquid properties as Fig.~\\ref{fig:LBexperiments},\nbut at a larger impact velocity.\nThe numerical simulation for similar conditions again reproduces very well the dynamics,\nincluding the shape of the large bubble and the liquid column at its center (Fig.~\\ref{Fig_S2}b).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{HigherV}\n  \\caption{(a) Large bubble entrapment for a drop of 10.5\\% $MgSO_{4}$ solution with viscosity 1.96~cP and density 1.105~g/cm$^3$,\n\timpacting into a pool of distilled water.\n\tImpact conditions: Prolate drop, $D=$~5.0~mm, $V=$~1.30~m/s, $H=$~9.1~cm.\n  The sequence shows the following times: -1.3, 5.4, 7, 11, 20~ms after the first contact.\n\tThe scale bar is 1~mm long.\n\t(b) Sequence in the same conditions as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble},\n\tbut higher impact velocity, and thus similar conditions as in the experiments of Fig.~\\ref{Fig_S2}.\n\t$t^{*} = $~-0.05, 0.18, 0.41, 0.87, 1.80, 2.99, 4.80.\n\t$D =$~5~mm, $V =$~1.30~m/s, $a =$~0.9.}\n  \\label{Fig_S2}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor reference, experiments in Figure~\\ref{Fig_S3} show the dynamics for oblate drops at two intermediate impact velocities,\nwhere no large bubble is entrapped.\nHowever, the collapse of the crater can produce vortex rings, as visible in the last panels.\nThe small drop visible in the fifth panel of both sequences is the satellite\nproduced when the primary drop pinches off from the nozzle.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{Oblate}\n  \\caption{Crater evolution for oblate drops, which never entrap a large bubble.\n\tDrop composition: 10.5\\% $MgSO_{4}$ solution with viscosity 1.96~cP and density 1.105~g/cm$^3$; pool: distilled water.\n\tImpact conditions: Oblate drop, $D=$~5.0~mm.\n  (a) For $V=$~1.11~m/s, $H=$~6.8~cm.

a large-bubble is entrapped into the pool.\nIt is therefore crucial to explain how this vortex is formed and how its formation relates to the drop shape.\nThis issue of vorticity production was debated two decades ago in the context of drop impact\n\\cite{Morton1992, Cresswell1992, Peck1994, Cresswell1995, Dooley1997},\nbut appears not to have been universally accepted within the community.\nThe proposed mechanism was neither verified experimentally nor numerically,\ndue to the challenges of capturing the dynamics near the interface.\nIt is therefore worthwhile to review some of the underlying arguments behind the theory,\nand support it quantitatively with our numerical results.\nA general review on vorticity production can be found in Br\u00c3\u00b8ns \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Brons2014},\nwhile we will focus here only on the case of drop impact.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{Figure_15}\n  \\caption{Emergence of the vorticity from the growing neck connecting the drop and the pool.}\n  \\label{Fig_15}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Vorticity production in drop impact}\n\nThe basic concept of {\\it the persistence of irrotationality}, i.e. fluid originally in irrotational motion\nwill continue to move irrotationally, is one of the foundations of classical hydrodynamics.\nThis theorem is discussed by Batchelor (page 276-277 in \\cite{Batchelor1967}) and he attributes it to Lagrange,\nwith the first demonstration by Cauchy in 1815.\nThe theorem applies for homogeneous flows with constant density which are originally irrotational or start from rest.\nThis applies at all times for inviscid fluids, but also for regular viscous fluids away from the boundaries,\nfrom where the vorticity must emerge.\nBatchelor further states: {\\it ''Vortex strength or circulation cannot be created in the interior of the fluid,\nbut once there it is spread by the action of viscosity''}\nand he continues for motions of a viscous fluid from rest (page 277 in \\cite{Batchelor1967}):\n{\\it ''Initially the vorticity is everywhere zero and the motion must remain wholly irrotational\nunless vorticity diffuses across the surface bounding the fluid''}.\n\nThis is clearly the basic condition when a drop impacts on a pool.\nThe pool is at rest and the motions within the falling drop are slow and likely well described by basic irrotational shape-oscillations,\nwhich are promoted during the pinch-off from the nozzle.\nIn the numerical simulations these initial motions within the drop can be set to zero and our initial conditions are simply a drop with a uniform vertical velocity.\nWith this initial condition, on the drop flow-field, our numerical simulations reproduce the experimental results.\nWe therefore conclude that the oscillatory motions within the falling drop are not a significant factor during the very rapid impact motions and can be ignored.\nThe oscillations only served the purpose of changing the drop shapes present at initial contact.\n\nThe vorticity in the observed vortex ring must therefore arise from the free surface and\ncannot be produced spontaneously within the pool by the pressure-driven initial flow due to the impact.\nThose motions must be irrotational as postulated above.\nThis can also be inferred from the absence of the pressure in the vorticity equation.\n\nNext we must ask: what is the nature of the vorticity production?\n\nCresswell \\& Morton \\cite{Cresswell1995} propose what we believe is the correct origin of the vorticity.\nTheir explanation is based on the vorticity produced by the flow $q$ along a curved free surface,\nwhich has a local radius of curvature $R$.\nThe strength of this vorticity generation for a stationary two-dimensional free surface has the form\n(Batchelor, page 366 \\cite{Batchelor1967}, \\cite{Sebilleau2009}):\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta \\omega = \\frac{2q

production, either $q$ must be large, or the radius of curvature $R$ very small.\nFor the drop-impact case, the sharp corner is formed in the neck connecting the drop to the pool\nonce they have formed a bridge.\n\nEq.~\\ref{Eq_1} is also valid for an interface with a fixed shape moving at a constant velocity \\cite[p. 365]{Batchelor1967}.\nOhring and Lugt \\cite{Ohring1989, Ohring1991} have also shown that it also gives a correct estimate\nof the vorticity produced for slowly deforming interfaces.\nEquation~\\ref{Eq_1} has been generalized to flows along three-dimensional free surfaces by Peck \\& Sigurdson \\cite{Peck1998b},\nbut this is not needed here.\n\nAlthough Eq.~\\ref{Eq_1} explains the origin of the vorticity, it only appears as a boundary condition to satisfy on the interface.\nOnce this vorticity is produced, it will diffuse into a thin boundary layer, which can separate to enter the pool.\nThese mechanisms have been studied by \\cite{Dooley1997, Peck1999}.\nHowever, it still remains a challenge to understand the separation of vorticity in drop impacts\nand its effects on the interface \\cite{Moore2014, Agbaglah2015}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Validation}\n\nOur numerical simulations have been able to correctly reproduce the large bubble entrapment\nthat was previously observed experimentally, and explain it by the pulling of a vortex ring.\nThey can therefore be used to pinpoint the origin of the vorticity in this vortex ring.\n\nThe insets in Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble} show that the vortex ring emerge from the sharp upper corner in the rapidly growing neck.\nThis is consistent with the explanation of Cresswell \\& Morton \\cite{Cresswell1995},\nsuggesting that the largest vorticity should be created in the regions of highest curvature.\nThis is shown in more detail in Fig.~\\ref{Fig_15}.\nNear the center of the drop the velocity vectors are vertical and gradually turn towards horizontal.\n\nWe can make another important clarification with this figure:\nno vorticity is produced at the interface between the liquid originally in the drop or the pool.\nIn the bottom left panel, we observe that two vortices of opposite signs are produced in the upper and lower corner of the neck.\nThis is consistent with the previous results of Josserand \\& Zaleski \\cite{Josserand2003}.\nIn the last bottom panel, the top corner of the neck has moved further away from the line,\ntogether with the point of highest vorticity, demonstrating this even more clearly.\nFor much higher impact velocities than studied here, the two opposite sign vortices\ncan shed alternatively forming a vortex street \\cite{Thoraval2012}.\n\nHowever, no significant vorticity is observed near the line separating the drop and pool liquids.\nThis simply comes from the fact that this interface, between the red and blue regions in top of Figure~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}(a),\nis not a material interface.\nIt is only a visualization artifact to identify the origin of the liquid, from the drop or pool.\nIn reality, it is only a homogeneous liquid.\nThe physical reason behind is that we are solving the Navier-Stokes equations,\nwhich do not allow for discontinuity.\nThe contact between the drop and the pool occurs smoothly, due to the air cushioning.\nThe velocity field is continuous even across this line between drop and pool liquids,\nwithout any vortex sheet produced there.\n\nWe can also verify the proposed vorticity production mechanism quantitatively with our numerical simulations.\nRelation~\\ref{Eq_1} is derived for a two-dimensional stationary free surface and the vorticity production could have other contributions\nfrom the deforming or accelerating interface, or due to the axisymmetric geometry or even three-dimensional effects in the experiments,\nor due to the presence of air.\nHowever, those contributions will only change the strength of the vorticity but not where it originates, i.e. at the interface.\nThis can be verified in the numerical simulations, by estimating the terms in Eq.~\\ref{Eq_1}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{VorticityIt-loglog-xb}\n  \\caption{Strength of the vortex ring as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Vorticity}(a)\n\tbut rescaled with the vertical extension of the drop $b$.}\n  \\label{fig:Vorticity-xb}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor a rough estimate we take the typical example of a water drop of diameter $D=5$~mm impacting at a velocity $V = 1$~m/s.\nThe vorticity maximum near the interface is $1.4 \\times 10^5$~s$^-1$ at $t = 0.52$~ms.\nThe minimum radius of curvature of the interface is observed at the same point, with $R = 10$~$\\mu$m,\nand the tangential velocity relative to the interface is $q = 1.27$~m/s.\nThe right hand side of Eq.~\\ref{Eq_1} $2q / R = 2.5 \\times 10^5$\nis of the same order of magnitude as the observed vorticity at the interface.\n\nAnother simple verification of Eq.~\\ref{Eq_1} can be done by looking at the effect of the geometry.\nRescaling the strength of the vortex ring by the vertical extension of the drop $b$\ncollapses the curves as can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Vorticity-xb}, \nwhere the curves are identical up to the point where the vortex interacts strongly with the free surface.\nThis is consistent with Eq.~\\ref{Eq_1} where the vorticity is proportional to the curvature of the interface, $\\propto 1/b$.\nThe early decay of the vorticity follows a $t^{-1/2}$ power-law, characteristic of viscous spreading.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nCombining experimental and numerical approaches, we have explained the mechanism underlying the large-bubble entrapment during drop impact,\nby a vortex ring which pulls the interface below the pool surface.\nThis pulling occurs earlier for oblate drops, leading to the self-destruction of the vortex.\nIn contrast, prolate drops produce a weaker vortex, that can separate from the interface during the early dynamics,\nand develop a vortical flow below the pool surface.\nAs the drop enters the pool and produces a cavity, the interface is pulled by the vortex,\nleading to the entrainment of the large bubble.\n\nBy turning off gravity in the numerical simulations,\nwe also show that hydrostatic pressure plays no role in the large-bubble entrapment.\nSuch bubble entrapment is observed for large drops impacting at low velocities,\nrelevant for the impact of secondary drops breaking from Worthington jets \\cite{Rein1993, Liow2001, Fedorchenko2004a},\nand wave breaking phenomena \\cite{Andreas1995, Anguelova1999, Wanninkhof2009, Bird2010, Kiger2012, Lhuissier2012, Veron2012, Veron2015}.\nIt has therefore important environmental implications \\cite{Bourouiba2013, Wilson2015},\nbut also in the industry where it can be beneficial for liquid aeration and gas-liquid chemical reactors \\cite{Oguz1995},\nand to enhance nucleate boiling \\cite{Dhir1998}.\n\n\n\\bibliography{References}\n\n\\onecolumngrid\n\\appendix\n\n\\clearpage\n\\newpage\n\n\\setcounter{equation}{0}\n\\setcounter{figure}{0}\n\\setcounter{table}{0}\n\\setcounter{page}{1}\n\\makeatletter\n\n\\onecolumngrid\n\\section*{Supplemental

occurs in a small region near the pool surface.\nIn the case presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble}, a higher level of refinement did not change the dynamics (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:largeBubble-lmax12}).\n\nHowever, this refinement was still not high enough to identify precisely the boundaries of the parameter space.\nFor $V = 0.9$~m/s for instance, the large bubble entrapment was observed at maximum level of refinement 11 ($ D / \\delta x = 532$),\nbut not for 10 ($ D / \\delta x = 266$) or 12 ($ D / \\delta x = 1065$) as shown in
