These theorems describe the size at which a point set can be dissected into overlapping convex hulls.\n\n\\begin{theoremp}[Tverberg's theorem]\nGiven a set of $(k-1)(d+1)+1$ points in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$, there is a partition of the set into $k$ parts such that the convex hulls of the parts intersect. Furthermore, this bound is optimal.\n\\end{theoremp}\n\nThe case $k=2$ is known as Radon's lemma or Radon's theorem.  There are many generalizations and extensions of Tverberg's theorem, such as colorful \\cite{Barany:1992tx, Blagojevic:2011vh, Blagojevic:2009wya}, topological \\cite{Barany:1981vh,  frick2015, Volovikov:1996up}, and quantitative versions \\cite{deloera2015} and are closely related to Helly's and Carath\\'eodory's theorems. (See the survey \\cite{Eck93} for a more in-depth presentation of the connections between theorems in combinatorial geometry.) The aim of this paper is to give new results regarding the algorithmic complexity of Tverberg-type results both in the classic geometric setting and in other convexity spaces.\n\nWe say a pair $(X, {\\operatorname{conv}})$ is a \\textit{convexity space} \\cite{van1993theory} if $X$ is a set and ${\\operatorname{conv}} : 2^X \\to 2^X$ is a function that satisfies\n\\begin{itemize}\n\t\\item $A \\subset {\\operatorname{conv}} (A)$ for all $A \\subset X$,\n\t\\item if $A \\subset B \\subset X$, then ${\\operatorname{conv}}(A) \\subset {\\operatorname{conv}} (B)$, and\n\t\\item ${\\operatorname{conv}} (A) = {\\operatorname{conv}} ({\\operatorname{conv}} (A))$ for all $ A \\subset X$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFor instance, if $X = {\\mathds{R}}^d$ and ${\\operatorname{conv}}(\\cdot)$ is the classic convex hull, we have a convexity space.  However, the definition above is relaxed enough to capture many purely combinatorial instances.  Given a connected graph $G$ and two vertices $u,v \\in V(G)$, we can define the segment $[u,v]$ as the union of all shortest paths from $u$ to $v$.  Then, for any $A \\subset V(G)$, we can take ${\\operatorname{conv}}(A) = \\cup_{u,v \\in A}[u,v]$, yielding what is known as a \\emph{geodetic convexity space}.  Tverberg-type results are interesting only for convexity spaces in which ${\\operatorname{conv}} (\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$.\n\n\\begin{definition}\nGiven a convexity space $(X, {\\operatorname{conv}})$, the $k$th \\emph{Radon number} (if it exists) is the smallest integer $r_k$ such that for any $r_k$ points in $X$, there is a $k$-partition such that the convex hulls of all parts intersect.\n\\end{definition}\n\nTverberg and Radon-type results in general convexity spaces are much more enigmatic than in the setting of ${\\mathds{R}}^d$.  A classic conjecture by Eckhoff, known as the partition conjecture \\cite{Eckhoff:2000jwa}, states that if $r_2$ exists, then $r_k$ exists and is at most $(r_2-1)(k-1)+1$.  Thus, if this conjecture holds, Tverberg's theorem is a purely combinatorial consequence of Radon's lemma.  Even though there have been convexity spaces proposed by Bukh showing that the partition conjecture does not hold in general \\cite{bukh}, it is interesting to know for which convexity spaces it does hold.\n\nIt was shown by Duchet that the partition conjecture on finite convexity spaces in fact reduces to the case of geodetic convexity spaces on graphs \\cite{duchet1998}. Jamison corroborated the partition conjecture for certain graphs \\cite{Jamison:1981wz}. However, geodetic convexity spaces for general graphs are little understood, and even the Radon numbers remain unknown for many graphs. Results for grid graphs were recently presented by Dourado et al.~in \\cite{dourado2013,dourado2013polynomial}.\n\nFor the classic notion of convexity in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$, it is not known if there exists an efficient algorithm for constructing Tverberg partitions under the assumptions of Tverberg's theorem. The case $k=2$ (finding a Radon partition) is, however, simple; this problem reduces to identifying a linear dependence. A similar technique can also be applied to variations on Radon partitions, such as the colorful version of Radon's lemma \\cite{Soberon:2013fr}, giving an algorithmic proof. The interesting challenge lies in Tverberg-type results with $k>2$.\n\nOne may rewrite Tverberg's theorem as follows.  Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$, there exists a partition into $m = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{d+1}\\right\\rceil$ parts such that the convex hulls of the parts intersect.  The problem of finding Tverberg partitions efficiently was motivated by the problem of finding centerpoints efficiently (see, for instance, \\cite{Miller:2009bg}).  Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$, we say a point $p$ is an $\\alpha$-centerpoint of $S$ if every closed halfspace containing $p$ has at least $\\alpha n$ points of $S$.  Notice that any point in the intersection of a Tverberg partition $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_m$ is immediately an $(m/n)$-centerpoint.  As Tverberg partitions can be checked for correctness, this provides a robust way of finding centerpoints.\n\nObtaining optimal Tverberg partitions efficiently is out of reach for current algorithms.  However, if one is willing to pay the price of decreasing the value of $m$ slightly, better results can be obtained.  For instance, there is a deterministic algorithm by Miller and Sheehy that solves the problem for $m = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{(d+1)^2}\\right\\rceil$ in $n^{O(\\log d)}$ time \\cite{Miller:2009bg}.  For faster running times in terms of $n$, there is an algorithm by Mulzer and Werner that solves the problem for $m = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{4(d+1)^3}\\right\\rceil$ in $d^{O(\\log d)}n$ time \\cite{MW13}.  Note that even though this last algorithm is linear in $n$, it is exponential in the dimension.  Related algorithms can be found for variations of Tverberg such as the version with tolerance \\cite{MS14, Soberon:2012er}.  In this variation, given a positive integer $r$, the goal is to find a Tverberg partition with the property that even after removing any $r$ points the convex hulls of what is left on each part still intersect.\n\nIn Section \\ref{sec:classic}, we show that one can go the other way around, using centerpoints to find Tverberg partitions efficiently.  Our algorithms are not deterministic. They carry a probability $\\varepsilon$ of failure, which may be fixed in advance, as they depend heavily on the computation of approximated centerpoints by Clarkson et al.~\\cite{Clarkson:1996ixba}.  For $m \\sim n/d^2$ we present an algorithm which is weakly polynomial in $n$, but exponential in the dimension.  For $m \\sim n/d^3$ we present an algorithm which is weakly polynomial in $n$, $d$ and $\\log (1/\\varepsilon)$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{theorem-centerpoint}\n Let $m = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{d(d+1)^2}\\right\\rceil$.  There is an algorithm such that, given $n$ points in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$, finds an $m$-Tverberg partition in time weakly polynomial in $n, d, \\log(1/\\varepsilon)$ with error probability $\\varepsilon$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{theorem-nonpolynomial-centerpoint}\nLet $d, \\lambda$ be fixed, where $d$ is a positive integer and $0<\\lambda<\\frac{1}{d+1}$, and $m = \\left\\lceil n\\left(\\frac{1}{d+1}-\\lambda \\right)\\frac{1}{d}\\right\\rceil$.  Then, there is an algorithm such that, given a set of $n$ points in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$, finds an $m$-Tverberg partition in weakly polynomial time in $n$, $O({n^4} \\log(1/{\\varepsilon}))$, with error probability $\\varepsilon$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nIn Theorem \\ref{theorem-nonpolynomial-centerpoint}, if we allow $d, \\lambda$ to vary, we need an additional factor of $(d/{\\lambda})^{O(d)}$. Finally, we note an extension of our results to the integer setting. The following integral version of Tverberg's theorem is known to hold \\cite{Eck68}:\n\n\\begin{theoremp}\nGiven $k,d$ positive integers, there is an integer $T=T(k,d)$ such that for any set of $T$ points in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$ with integer coordinates, there is a partition of the set into $k$ parts such that the intersection of the convex hulls of the parts contains a point with integer coordinates.\n\\end{theoremp}\n\nNote that even the case $k=2$ is not completely solved, as the best current bounds are $5\\cdot 2^{d-2}+1 \\le T(2,d) \\le d\\cdot (2^d-1)+3$ and $T(k,d) \\le (k-1)d\\cdot 2^d+1$ \\cite{deloera2015, Onn:1991er}.  The algorithms we use can be extended to this setting, yielding the following:\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{theorem-integer-tverberg}\nLet $d, \\lambda, \\varepsilon$ be fixed and that $0<\\lambda<{2^{-(d+2)}}$.  Then, there is an algorithm which is weakly polynomial in $n$ such that, with error probability $\\varepsilon$, for any set of $n$ integer points in ${\\mathds{R}}^d$, it gives a partition of them into $\\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{d} \\left(\\frac{1}{2^{d}}-\\lambda \\right) \\right\\rceil$ parts and an integer point $z\\in {\\mathds{R}}^d$ which is in the convex hull of every part.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nIn Section \\ref{sec:geodetic-positive}, we present algorithms for finding Tverberg partitions in geodetic convexity spaces induced by certain graphs. These algorithms rely on a similar notion of centerpoints to those we present for the classic convexity setting, but are deterministic.  Given a graph $G$, we say it is $2$-separable if it is connected and for any two vertices $u,v$ there are at most two edges such that removing them disconnects $u$ from $v$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{theorem-for-trees}\nLet $G$ be a tree and $U \\subset V$ be a subset of $2k$ vertices.  Then, there exists a partition of $U$ into $k$ sets such that their convex hulls intersect; moreover this partition may be found efficiently.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{theorem-for-2-sep}\nLet $G$ be a $2$-separable graph, and $U$ a set of $4k-2$ vertices of $G$.  Then, there exists a partition of $U$ into $k$ parts such that their convex hulls intersect; moreover this partition may be found efficiently.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nWe conclude in Section \\ref{sec:geodetic-negative} by presenting results on the hardness of finding Radon partitions for the geodetic convexity spaces induced by general graphs.  We define the \\emph{graph-Radon problem} as follows:\\\\\n\\textbf{Input:} A graph $G=(V,E)$ and subset $W\\subset V$.\\\\\n\\textbf{Output:} A decision whether or not there exists a partition $(W^+,W^-)$ of $W$ such that ${\\operatorname{conv}}(W^+)\\cap {\\operatorname{conv}}(W^-)$ is nonempty.\n\nLikewise, we define the \\emph{graph-Radon counting problem}:\\\\\n\\textbf{Input:} A graph $G=(V,E)$ and subset $W\\subset V$.\\\\\n\\textbf{Output:} The number of partitions $(W^+,W^-)$ of $W$ such that ${\\operatorname{conv}}(W^+)\\cap {\\operatorname{conv}}(W^-)$ is nonempty.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{thm:onepartition}\nThe graph-Radon problem is NP-hard and the graph-Radon counting problem is \\#P-hard.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nAs a corollary to these results, we present a novel proof that it is NP-hard to compute the Radon number of the geodetic convexity space induced by a general graph, proven recently by Coelho et al.~\\cite{coelho2015}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Algorithms for classic Tverberg partitions}\n\\label{sec:classic}\n\nWe make use of Carath\\'eodory's theorem in order to find Tverberg partitions.\n\n\\begin{theoremp}[Carath\\'eodory's theorem \\cite{Car07}]\nGiven a set $X \\subset {\\mathds{R}}^d$ and a point $z \\in {\\operatorname{conv}} (X)$, there is a subset $C$ of at most $d+1$ points of $X$ such that $z \\in {\\operatorname{conv}}(X)$.\n\\end{theoremp}\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lemma-caratheodory}\nGiven $X$ and $z$, we can find $C$ using linear programming in time weakly polynomial in $|X|$ and $d$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma \\ref{lemma-caratheodory}]\nDeciding whether a point $z$ is in the convex hull of a set $Y$ can be expressed by the following linear program, where the $\\lambda_y$ represent variables and $y\\in Y$ are $d$-dimensional constant vectors:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{y\\in Y} \\lambda_y y &= z\\\\\n\\sum_{y \\in Y} \\lambda_y &= 1 \\\\\n\\lambda_y &\\ge 0\\text{ for all $y\\in Y$}.\n\\end{align*}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\sum_{y\\in Y}\\lambda_{y}y\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow></munder></mstyle><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>y</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=z\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\sum_{y\\in Y}\\lambda_{y}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow></munder></mstyle><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>y</mi></msub></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=1\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\lambda_{y}\" display=\"inline\"><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>y</mi></msub></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\geq 0\\text{ for all $y\\in Y$}.\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>\u2265</mo><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mtext>\u00a0for all\u00a0</mtext><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03083.tex", "nexttext": "\nBy construction, $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfies the conditions of Doignon's theorem.

The partition conjecture was already established for trees by Jamison \\cite{Jamison:1981wz}; our proof of Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-trees} gives the optimal Tverberg number and shows how such a partition may be found algorithmically.\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-trees}]\nLet $p$ be an arbitrary vertex of the tree $G$.  Suppose that removing $p$ splits $G$ into $r$ connected components $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_r$, and let $a_i = |G_i \\cap U|$ for all $i$.  We first show that we can find $p$ such that $a_i \\le k$ for all $i$.  If this is not the case, assume without loss of generality that $a_1 \\ge k+1$.  Notice that there is a vertex $p'$ in $G_1$ which is adjacent to $p$, so we replace $p$ by $p'$.  By doing this, $G_2, G_3, \\ldots , G_r$ and $\\{p\\}$ merge into one big component, but since they had altogether at most $k$ points of $U$, they do not cause a problem.  $G_1 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ may be split into more than one component, but at most one of them has more than $k$ points of $S$.  If this is the case, call it $G_1'$.  Since $G_1'$ has fewer vertices than $G_1$, this process must end after at most $|G|$ iterations.\n\nIn order to find the partition, define $G_0 = \\{p\\}$.  It suffices to notice that if we take two vertices of $U$ in different components $G_i$, $G_j$, their convex hull must contain $p$.  For any partition of a set of $2k$ vertices in which no part has more than $k$ vertices, there is a way to pair up points such that no pair lies in the same part.  Therefore, we obtain the desired result.  The desired pairing can be also be found algorithmically.  Simply take the two parts with the largest number of vertices $G_1$, $G_2$, pick two arbitrary vertices $v_1 \\in G_1, v_2 \\in G_2$, make them an edge of the matching and set them aside.  Then, continue in the same way with the rest of the graph.  This process ensures that at every stage no component has more than half of the remaining vertices, so we can continue until the graph is empty.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn order to show that the value $2k$ is optimal, take any set of size $2k-1$ of leaves of a tree.  Since any partition of them into $k$ sets must include a singleton, there is no Tverberg partition into $k$ parts.  From this theorem, we may verify Eckhoff's partition conjecture in the case of geodetic convexity spaces on trees:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 18251, "prevtext": "\nBy construction, $\\mathcal{F}$ satisfies the conditions of Doignon's theorem.

However, this only happens with trees with exactly two leaves, reducing to the case of Radon on the real line.  It should be stressed that the algorithm presented here is similar to those in the previous section.  Indeed, our point $p$ is the equivalent of a centerpoint for $U$, as the convex hull of any subset of $U$ of cardinality greater than $|U|/2$ contains $p$. The same idea is extended to another family of graphs in Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-2-sep}. In this case instead of a single centerpoint, we look for a pair of vertices that in some sense serve jointly as centerpoints.\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-2-sep}]\nIf we could show that there are two vertices $x,y$ such that no connected component of $G\\setminus \\{x,y\\}$ has more than $2k-1$ vertices of $U$, we would be done.  This is because in that case we could find a partition of $U$ into $2k-1$ pairs such that the convex hull of each pair contains at least one of $x,y$.  By the pigeonhole principle, this would imply that at least $k$ pairs intersects in either $x$ or $y$, yielding the partition we seek.\n\nNotice that the condition of $2$-separability means that two different cycles cannot share more than one vertex.  Otherwise, we would be able to find two vertices with three edge-disjoint paths connecting them.\n\nWe construct an auxiliary graph $G'$ as follows.  First, we color the graph $G$ blue.  Then, consider any vertex $v$ that is in more than one cycle.  Notice that these cycles are pairwise edge-disjoint.  If $v$ is in $n$ cycles, we replace $v$ by $n$ blue vertices $v_1, v_2, \\ldots , v_n$ and set $v_i$ adjacent to the vertices that $v$ was adjacent to in the $i$-th cycle.  Then, we include a red vertex $v_0$ which is connected to $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$.  An example is provided in Figure \\ref{fig:connected-tverberg}.  We see that $G'$ is connected and $2$-separable.  Moreover, in $G'$ no two cycles share a vertex.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{auxiliary-graph.png}\n\\caption{The construction of $G'$ from $G$.}\n\\label{fig:connected-tverberg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us show that no red vertex of $G'$ is in a cycle.  Suppose towards contradiction that $v_0$ is a red vertex which is in a cycle $L_r$.  Notice that in the cycle $v_0$ must be adjacent to some $v_i$, which in turn is in a blue cycle $L_b$.  If we follow $L_r$ in the direction from $v_i$ to $v_0$, at some point it must return to $L_b$.  However, it cannot return to $L_b$ through $v_i$, so the first time it gets back to $L_b$ it must be using a different vertex $x$.  Notice that this induces a path in $G$ from $v$ to $x$ which does not use vertices of $L_b$, and contradicts the fact that $G$ is $2$-separable.  Hence, no red vertex of $G'$ can lie in a cycle.\n\nAlong with $G'$, we define a copy $U'$ of $U$.  If $v$ was a vertex of $U$ in at most one cycle of $G$, we set its corresponding copy in $G'$ to be part of $U'$.  If $v$ was a member of $U$ in more than one cycle, we set only $v_0$ (the red copy) to be part of $U'$.  If we can find two vertices in $G'$ such that removing them leaves only connected components with at most $2k-1$ points of $U'$ each, the corresponding pair (or single vertex) in $G$ would also work, as the only change could be that $G$ would be shattered into more connected components.\n\nNow we construct a second auxiliary graph $G''$ from $G'$.  For each cycle in $G'$, include a vertex in $G''$, and for every vertex in $G'$ which is contained in no cycle, include a vertex in $G''$.  Set $u$, $v$ in $G''$ to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting some vertex corresponding to $u$ and some vertex corresponding to $v$.  Since $G'$ is connected, so is $G''$.  Let us show that $G''$ has no cycles.\n\nIf there were a cycle $L'$ in $G''$, all the vertices of $L'$ would correspond to cycles in $G'$.  Take $u$ one of its vertices.  Using the cycle $L'$, we can find a cycle in $G'$ different from the one corresponding to $u$ which intersects it.  This contradicts the construction of $G'$, in which no two cycles share a vertex.\n\nThus, $G''$ is a tree.  Now to each vertex in $G''$ we assign the number of vertices in $U'$ that correspond to it.  Following the same method as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-trees}, we can find a vertex $p$ in $G''$ the removal of which leaves connected components with at most $2k-1$ vertices of $U'$ each.  If $p$ corresponds to a vertex in $G'$, removing it (and any other point $y$) gives us the partition we seek.\n\nIf $p$ corresponds to some cycle $L$ in $G'$, we have to do more work.  For this, we can represent the vertices of $L$ as the vertices of a regular $|L|$-gon in the plane in the order of the cycle.  To each vertex $v$ of $L$ we assign two numbers.  The first, $\\mu_1(v)$ is $0$ or $1$ depending on whether $v$ is in $U'$ or not.  The second, $\\mu_2(v)$, is computed as follows.  Notice that when we removed $p$ from $G''$, we had several connected components left.  Each of these corresponds to a connected component in $G'$ which is connected to exactly one point of $L$.  We take $\\mu_2(v)$ to be the number of points of $U'$ contained in connected components of $G'\\setminus L$ which were connected to $v$ in $L$.\n\nNotice that $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are two discrete finite measures in the plane whose sum is $4k-2$.  By the discrete version of the ham sandwich theorem, there is a line $\\ell$ which leaves at most half of each measure in each halfspace.  We may assume without loss of generality that $\\ell$ contains exactly two points $x,y$ of $L$.  Let us show that this choice of $x,y$ satisfies the conditions we seek.\n\nWe let $k_1,k_2$ be the total measures of $\\mu_1,\\mu_2$, respectively, so that $k_1+k_2=4k-2$.  When we remove the points $x,y$, we are left with at most two connected components which contain points of $L$.  By the construction of $\\ell$, these have no more than $\\lfloor k_1/2\\rfloor+\\lfloor k_2 /2 \\rfloor$ points of $U'$ each.  We also have the connected components which were connected only to $x$ or only to $y$, but these each have at most $2k-1$ points of $U'$ by the construction of $L$.  Thus, removing $x,y$ gives us the partition we want, since each part contains at most $\\max\\{\\lfloor k_1/2\\rfloor+\\lfloor k_2 /2 \\rfloor, 2k-1\\}=2k-1$.\n\nNotice as well that we may even allow for $U$ to have repeated vertices, and the only change would be in allowing the vertices of $G'$ to preserve such multiplicities in $U'$, and in the definition of $\\mu_2$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Hardness of general Radon partitions}\n\\label{sec:geodetic-negative}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:onepartition}.]\nGiven a Boolean formula $\\Phi$ in conjunctive normal form, we will describe a graph $G=(V,E)$ and $W\\subset V$ with size ${\\operatorname{poly}}(n)$, where a Radon partition $(W^+,W^-)$ corresponds to a truth assignment satisfying $\\Phi$.  This suffices to prove the theorem, as SAT is a known NP-hard problem, while counting the number of satisfying assignments is known to be \\#P-hard.\n\n\\textbf{Claim.} It suffices to consider $\\Phi$ where every clause contains either all positive literals or all negative literals.\n\nTo prove the claim, suppose that $\\Phi$ is given in terms of variables $x_i$.  Replace every occurrence of $-x_i$ in $\\Phi$ by a new variable $y_i$, and add the clauses $(x_i\\vee y_i)$ and $(-x_i\\vee -y_i)$ for every $i$, which ensures that $x_i$ and $y_i$ have opposite truth value.  In the new formula $\\Phi'$, every clause must have either all positive literals or all negative literals; and solutions to $\\Phi'$ exactly correspond to solutions to $\\Phi$, as desired.\n\nSuppose now that $\\Phi$ takes the form given in the claim, with variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ occurring as positive literals in clauses $C^+_1,\\ldots,C^+_\\ell$, and occurring as negative literals in clauses $C^-_1,\\ldots,C^-_m$.  For convenience, we will also suppose that $\\ell,m\\ge 1$; if this is not true, we may simply add a new variable and a corresponding new clause containing it.\n\nWe now outline the construction of our graph $G$ (shown in Figure \\ref{fig:SAT-graph}).

The motivation is that in any $2$-partition of $W$ such that $w^+$ and $w^-$ are in different parts, we consider the variable $x_i$ to be True if $w_i$ is in the same part as $w^+$, and to be False if $w_i$ is in the same part as $w^-$.  We will eventually deal with the case where $w^+$ and $w^-$ are in the same part; however, for the moment let us assume that each of the variables is designated unambiguously True or False.\n\nEach vertex $v$ in $V$, with the exception of $v_0$, possesses a parameter called \\emph{height}, denoted $h(v)$.  The height of a vertex is a nonnegative integer, equal to $0$ for $v\\in W^0\\cup \\{w^+,w^-\\}$ and taking on various positive values for $v\\in V^+$ or $v\\in V^-$.  The importance of the height is as follows: Suppose we start out with a subset of the height-0 vertices and wish to find the convex hull of these vertices.  In each \\emph{extension step}, we add all vertices which lie on shortest paths between existing vertices.  Then, we will design $G$ such that in the first extension step we acquire only height-1 vertices, in the second extension step only height-2 vertices, and so on.  We will never end up with more height-0 vertices than we started with, or with more height-$t$ vertices than we acquired at extension step $t$.  This means that we will be able to analyze the process of building the convex hull, one extension step at a time.\n\nIn addition to this property, we will construct $G$ with the following property: The convex hull of a subset of $W$ contains a vertex of $V^+\\setminus \\{v_0\\}$ only if it contains $w^+$; likewise it contains a vertex of $V^-\\setminus \\{v_0\\}$ only if it contains $w^-$.  Intuitively, $V^+$ is the part of the graph that handles True variables, and $V^-$ is the part of the graph that handles False variables.  We will now present the structure of $V^+$ and $V^-$.  Given a partition of $W$ in which $w^+$ and $w^-$ lie in different parts, we will refer to the convex hull of the part with $w^+$ as the \\emph{positive convex hull}, and likewise define the \\emph{negative convex hull}.\n\nAt height 1 in $G$, we define vertices corresponding to two copies of each literal:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 21885, "prevtext": "\n\\end{definition}\n\nIn particular, a $\\beta$-center of a $\\lambda$-sample of $S$ is immediately a $(\\beta - \\lambda)$-center of $S$, for $\\beta \\ge 4\\lambda$.

Suppose that removing $p$ splits $G$ into $r$ connected components $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_r$, and let $a_i = |G_i \\cap U|$ for all $i$.  We first show that we can find $p$ such that $a_i \\le k$ for all $i$.  If this is not the case, assume without loss of generality that $a_1 \\ge k+1$.  Notice that there is a vertex $p'$ in $G_1$ which is adjacent to $p$, so we replace $p$ by $p'$.  By doing this, $G_2, G_3, \\ldots , G_r$ and $\\{p\\}$ merge into one big component, but since they had altogether at most $k$ points of $U$, they do not cause a problem.  $G_1 \\setminus \\{p\\}$ may be split into more than one component, but at most one of them has more than $k$ points of $S$.  If this is the case, call it $G_1'$.  Since $G_1'$ has fewer vertices than $G_1$, this process must end after at most $|G|$ iterations.\n\nIn order to find the partition, define $G_0 = \\{p\\}$.  It suffices to notice that if we take two vertices of $U$ in different components $G_i$, $G_j$, their convex hull must contain $p$.  For any partition of a set of $2k$ vertices in which no part has more than $k$ vertices, there is a way to pair up points such that no pair lies in the same part.  Therefore, we obtain the desired result.  The desired pairing can be also be found algorithmically.  Simply take the two parts with the largest number of vertices $G_1$, $G_2$, pick two arbitrary vertices $v_1 \\in G_1, v_2 \\in G_2$, make them an edge of the matching and set them aside.  Then, continue in the same way with the rest of the graph.  This process ensures that at every stage no component has more than half of the remaining vertices, so we can continue until the graph is empty.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn order to show that the value $2k$ is optimal, take any set of size $2k-1$ of leaves of a tree.  Since any partition of them into $k$ sets must include a singleton, there is no Tverberg partition into $k$ parts.  From this theorem, we may verify Eckhoff's partition conjecture in the case of geodetic convexity spaces on trees:\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "$$r_k = 2k \\le 3(k-1)+1 = (r_2-1)(k-1)+1.$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"r_{k}=2k\\leq 3(k-1)+1=(r_{2}-1)(k-1)+1.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03083.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe vertices $u_i^+,v_i^+$ are both included in the positive convex hull if (and only if) $x_i$ is True, and $u_i^-,v_i^-$ are both included in the negative convex hull if (and only if) $x_i$ is False.  To achieve this, we simply make $u_i^+,v_i^+$ adjacent to both $w_i$ and $w^+$, while $u_i^-,v_i^-$ are adjacent to both $w_i$ and $w^-$.  Thus, the shortest path between $w_i$ and $w^+$ includes $u_i^+,v_i^+$, justifying our claim that height-1 vertices are included in the convex hull on the first extension step.\n\nThe construction of $V^+$ and $V^-$ will be exactly symmetric from this point, and we will therefore present only the construction of $V^+$.  The key here is that every vertex of $V^+$ is adjacent to $w^+$.  The reason for this is that every shortest path between vertices of $V^+$ thus has length 1 or 2.  It will be easy to ensure, therefore, that no pairs of vertices augment the convex hull in undesirable ways.\n\nAt height 2, we define vertices $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+\\in V^+$ for each occurrence of literal $x_i$ in clause $C^+_j$. (Likewise, we define $u_{ik}^-,v_{ik}^-\\in V^-$ for each occurrence of literal $-x_i$ in clause $C^-_k$.)  We let $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+$ be adjacent to $u_i^+$ and $v_i^+$. Since $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+$ lie in $V^+$, they are also adjacent to $w^+$.  Then, $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+$ lie on shortest paths between $u_i^+$ and $v_i^+$; thus $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+$ are included in the positive convex hull at the second extension step if and only if $x_i$ is True.\n\nAt height 3, we define a vertex $c_j^+\\in V^+$ for each clause $C^+_j$ such that $c_j^+$ is adjacent to $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+$ for every value of $i$ such that $x_i$ occurs in $C^+_j$. Then, $c_j^+$ lies on a shortest path between $u_{ij}^+$ and $v_{ij}^+$; thus $c_j^+$ is included in the positive convex hull at the third extension step if and only if $x_i$ is True.  In essence, we have defined an OR gate for the positive literals that appear in the clause $C^+_j$.\n\nIt may seem obscure why we defined $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+$, instead of letting $c_j^+$ be adjacent to $u_i^+,v_i^+$ directly.  The reason is that we must ensure that vertices of greater height do not cause vertices of lower height to be included in the convex hull.  If $c_j^+,d_j^+$ were adjacent to $u_i^+,v_i^+$, then any literal $x_i$ common to clauses $C^+_j$ and $C^+_{j'}$ would be switched to True whenever $c_j^+,c_{j'}^+$ were both included in the positive convex hull.  This is undesirable; therefore, we introduce $u_{ij}^+,v_{ij}^+$, which provide additional space and prevent $u_i^+$ from being included in shortest paths from $c_j^+$ and $c_{j'}^+$.  The reason for this is that any shortest path between $c_j^+$ and $c_{j'}^+$ must have length 2, since both vertices are adjacent to $w^+$.\n\nRecall that we want to create a correspondence between solutions to $\\Phi$ and Radon partitions of the vertices $W$.  Given such a partition, corresponding to an assignment of True/False to every variable $x_i$, we have seen that each $c_j^+$ lies in the positive convex hull if and only if $C^+_j$ is satisfied. We will now define an AND gate to determine when all of the clauses $c_j^+$ lie in the positive convex hull.\n\nFor each $j$ with $1\\le j\\le \\ell$, recursively define vertices $a_j^+\\in V^+$ at height $2+j$ as follows: Let $a_1^+=c_1^+$, and for $j\\ge 1$ let $a_j^+$ be adjacent to $a_{j-1}^+$ and $c_j^+$.  Observe that $a_j^+$ lies in the positive convex hull if and only if the vertices $c_1^+,c_2^+,\\ldots,c_j^+$ lie in the positive convex hull.  Likewise, we define vertices $a_k^-$ for $1\\le k\\le m$.  The crucial detail is that we identify $a_\\ell^+$ and $a_m^-$ as a common vertex $v_0$.  (This is why the height of $v_0$ is not defined, since $2+\\ell$ may not be equal to $2+m$.)  Observe that for a partition of $W$, the vertex $v_0$ lies in both the positive and negative convex hulls exactly when every $C_j^+$ and every $C_k^-$ is satisfied.  Moreover, $v_0$ is the only possible overlap between the positive and negative convex hulls. Hence, Radon partitions of $W$ correspond exactly to truth assignments that satisfy $\\Phi$.\n\nOne final detail remains: We assumed that, in any partition of $W$, the vertices $w^+$ and $w^-$ lie in different parts.  In order to enforce this requirement, we let $W^0$ form a clique, and add an edge between $w^+$ and $w^-$.  For any partition of $W$ in which $w^+$ and $w^-$ lie in the same part, one of the two parts must contain only elements of $W^0$, and therefore forms a clique, which is its own convex hull.  We have defined the graph $G$ in such a way that the convex hull of $W^0\\cup\\{w^+,w^-\\}\\backslash W'$ does not overlap $W'$, for any subset $W'\\subseteq W^0$.  (The reason for the edge between $w^+$ and $w^-$ is so that shortest paths between vertices of $V^+$ and $V^-$ lie through $w^+$ and $w^-$ and therefore do not intersect $W'$.)  We conclude that, in any Radon partition, the vertices $w^+$ and $w^-$ must indeed lie in different parts.  This completes our proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\nOur approach suggests an alternate proof for the statement (proven in \\cite{coelho2015}) that it is NP-hard to calculate the geodetic Radon number.\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of hardness of geodetic Radon number]\nSuppose that we are given a CNF formula $\\Phi$ with variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ and clauses $C_1,\\ldots,C_m$.  Let us define a formula $\\Phi^\\ell$ on variables $\\cup_{j=1}^\\ell \\{x_1^j,\\ldots,x_n^j\\}$.  Let the clauses take the form $C^1_{i_1}\\vee C^2_{i_2}\\vee \\cdots \\vee C^\\ell_{i_\\ell}$ for all possible selections $i_1,\\ldots,i_\\ell\\in \\{1,\\ldots,m\\}$, where $C^j_{i_j}$ denotes the clause $C_{i_j}$ written using the variables $x^j_i$.  Thus, each clause of $\\Phi^\\ell$ corresponds to an $\\ell$-tuple of clauses of $\\Phi$, and is satisfied if any of the constituent clauses is satisfied.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 1.} $\\Phi^\\ell$ is satisfiable if and only if $\\Phi$ is satisfiable.\n\nIf $\\Phi$ has a satisfying assignment $x_i=t_i$, then we can create a satisfying assignment for $\\Phi^\\ell$ by setting $x_i^j=t_i$ for each $j$.  Conversely, suppose that $\\Phi^\\ell$ has a satisfying assignment $x_i^j=t_i^j$.  We claim that for some $j$, the assignment $x_i=t_i^j$ is satisfying for $\\Phi$.  Suppose towards contradiction that for each $j$, there exists a clause $C_{i_j}^j$ of $\\Phi$ which is not satisfied by the assignment $x_i=t_i^j$.  Then, the clause $C^1_{i_1}\\vee C^2_{i_2}\\vee \\cdots \\vee C^\\ell_{i_\\ell}$ of $\\Phi^\\ell$ is not satisfied by $x_i^j=t_i^j$, giving us our contradiction.\n\n\\textbf{Claim 2.} Suppose we remove up to $\\ell-1$ variables from $\\Phi^\\ell$ (i.e., remove all occurrences of these variables without deleting clauses) to obtain $\\tilde{\\Phi}$. Then, $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is satisfiable if $\\Phi$ is satisfiable.\n\nAfter removing up to $\\ell-1$ variables, there must remain some value $j_0$ such that none of $x_1^{j_0},x_2^{j_0},\\ldots,x_n^{j_0}$ is removed.  If $x_i=t_i$ is a satisfying assignment for $\\Phi$, then assigning $x_i^{j_0}=t_i$ (and assigning all other $x_i^j$ arbitrarily) gives us a satisfying assignment for $\\Phi^\\ell$, as desired.\n\nLet $G(\\Phi)$ denote the graph defined in the proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:onepartition}, where $\\Phi$ is a CNF formula.   Now, consider the graph $G=G(\\Phi^\\ell)$, where we will pick $\\ell$ to be a fixed constant, so that the size of $G$ is polynomial in $n$. Let $V^+,V^-,W^0,w^+,w^-$ be as in the preceding proof. Consider the problem of determining whether $G$ has Radon number $\\ell n+2$.  Let $W$ be a subset of the vertices of $G$ such that $|W|=\\ell n+2$.  Note that if $W=W^0\\cup \\{w^+,w^-\\}$, then there exists a Radon partition of $W$ if and only if $\\Phi$ is satisfiable (by Claim 1 and Theorem \\ref{thm:onepartition}).  Hence, the Radon number of $G$ is greater than $\\ell n+2$ if $\\Phi$ is not satisfiable.  We will show now that the Radon number is at most $\\ell n+2$ if $\\Phi$ \\emph{is} satisfiable.  We divide into two cases based upon the structure of $W$.\n\n\\textbf{Case 1.} Both $|W\\cap V^+|$ and $|W\\cap V^-|$ are at most $\\lfloor (\\ell-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n\nThis condition implies that $W$ differs from $W^0\\cup \\{w^+,w^-\\}$ in at most $\\ell-1$ vertices.  Let us modify $\\Phi^\\ell$ to $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ by removing the variables corresponding to these vertices.  Then, Claim 2 implies that if $\\Phi$ is satisfiable, then $\\tilde{\\Phi}$ is also; hence there exists a Radon partition of $W$.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2.} $|W\\cap V^+|$ or $|W\\cap V^-|$ is greater than $\\lfloor (\\ell-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose $|W\\cap V^+|\\ge \\lfloor (\\ell-1)/2\\rfloor$.  Note that, by construction, there are no triangles within $V^+$; therefore, by choosing $\\ell$ large enough, we can ensure that there exist vertices $y_1,y_2,z_1,z_2\\in W\\cap V^+$ such that $y_1,y_2$ and $z_1,z_2$ are non-adjacent.  Then, $w^+$ is included on shortest paths between $y_1,y_2$ and between $z_1,z_2$. Hence, any partition of $W$ is a Radon partition if $y_1,y_2$ are in different parts, as are $z_1,z_2$.\n\nWe conclude that determining the Radon number of $G$ allows us to infer the satisfiability of $\\Phi$, from which the result follows.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to thank Jes\\'us De Loera and Reuben La Haye for their helpful comments during this work.

However, this only happens with trees with exactly two leaves, reducing to the case of Radon on the real line.  It should be stressed that the algorithm presented here is similar to those in the previous section.  Indeed, our point $p$ is the equivalent of a centerpoint for $U$, as the convex hull of any subset of $U$ of cardinality greater than $|U|/2$ contains $p$. The same idea is extended to another family of graphs in Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-2-sep}. In this case instead of a single centerpoint, we look for a pair of vertices that in some sense serve jointly as centerpoints.\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-2-sep}]\nIf we could show that there are two vertices $x,y$ such that no connected component of $G\\setminus \\{x,y\\}$ has more than $2k-1$ vertices of $U$, we would be done.  This is because in that case we could find a partition of $U$ into $2k-1$ pairs such that the convex hull of each pair contains at least one of $x,y$.  By the pigeonhole principle, this would imply that at least $k$ pairs intersects in either $x$ or $y$, yielding the partition we seek.\n\nNotice that the condition of $2$-separability means that two different cycles cannot share more than one vertex.  Otherwise, we would be able to find two vertices with three edge-disjoint paths connecting them.\n\nWe construct an auxiliary graph $G'$ as follows.  First, we color the graph $G$ blue.  Then, consider any vertex $v$ that is in more than one cycle.  Notice that these cycles are pairwise edge-disjoint.  If $v$ is in $n$ cycles, we replace $v$ by $n$ blue vertices $v_1, v_2, \\ldots , v_n$ and set $v_i$ adjacent to the vertices that $v$ was adjacent to in the $i$-th cycle.  Then, we include a red vertex $v_0$ which is connected to $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$.  An example is provided in Figure \\ref{fig:connected-tverberg}.  We see that $G'$ is connected and $2$-separable.  Moreover, in $G'$ no two cycles share a vertex.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{auxiliary-graph.png}\n\\caption{The construction of $G'$ from $G$.}\n\\label{fig:connected-tverberg}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLet us show that no red vertex of $G'$ is in a cycle.  Suppose towards contradiction that $v_0$ is a red vertex which is in a cycle $L_r$.  Notice that in the cycle $v_0$ must be adjacent to some $v_i$, which in turn is in a blue cycle $L_b$.  If we follow $L_r$ in the direction from $v_i$ to $v_0$, at some point it must return to $L_b$.  However, it cannot return to $L_b$ through $v_i$, so the first time it gets back to $L_b$ it must be using a different vertex $x$.  Notice that this induces a path in $G$ from $v$ to $x$ which does not use vertices of $L_b$, and contradicts the fact that $G$ is $2$-separable.  Hence, no red vertex of $G'$ can lie in a cycle.\n\nAlong with $G'$, we define a copy $U'$ of $U$.  If $v$ was a vertex of $U$ in at most one cycle of $G$, we set its corresponding copy in $G'$ to be part of $U'$.  If $v$ was a member of $U$ in more than one cycle, we set only $v_0$ (the red copy) to be part of $U'$.  If we can find two vertices in $G'$ such that removing them leaves only connected components with at most $2k-1$ points of $U'$ each, the corresponding pair (or single vertex) in $G$ would also work, as the only change could be that $G$ would be shattered into more connected components.\n\nNow we construct a second auxiliary graph $G''$ from $G'$.  For each cycle in $G'$, include a vertex in $G''$, and for every vertex in $G'$ which is contained in no cycle, include a vertex in $G''$.  Set $u$, $v$ in $G''$ to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting some vertex corresponding to $u$ and some vertex corresponding to $v$.  Since $G'$ is connected, so is $G''$.  Let us show that $G''$ has no cycles.\n\nIf there were a cycle $L'$ in $G''$, all the vertices of $L'$ would correspond to cycles in $G'$.  Take $u$ one of its vertices.  Using the cycle $L'$, we can find a cycle in $G'$ different from the one corresponding to $u$ which intersects it.  This contradicts the construction of $G'$, in which no two cycles share a vertex.\n\nThus, $G''$ is a tree.  Now to each vertex in $G''$ we assign the number of vertices in $U'$ that correspond to it.  Following the same method as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{theorem-for-trees}, we can find a vertex $p$ in $G''$ the removal of which leaves connected components with at most $2k-1$ vertices of $U'$ each.  If $p$ corresponds to a vertex in $G'$, removing it (and any other point $y$) gives us the partition we seek.\n\nIf $p$ corresponds to some cycle $L$ in $G'$, we have to do more work.  For this, we can represent the vertices of $L$ as the vertices of a regular $|L|$-gon in the plane in the order of the cycle.  To each vertex $v$ of $L$ we assign two numbers.  The first, $\\mu_1(v)$ is $0$ or $1$ depending on whether $v$ is in $U'$ or not.  The second, $\\mu_2(v)$, is computed as follows.  Notice that when we removed $p$ from $G''$, we had several connected components left.  Each of these corresponds to a connected component in $G'$ which is connected to exactly one point of $L$.  We take $\\mu_2(v)$ to be the number of points of $U'$ contained in connected components of $G'\\setminus L$ which were connected to $v$ in $L$.\n\nNotice that $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are two discrete finite measures in the plane whose sum is $4k-2$.  By the discrete version of the ham sandwich theorem, there is a line $\\ell$ which leaves at most half of each measure in each halfspace.  We may assume without loss of generality that $\\ell$ contains exactly two points $x,y$ of $L$.  Let us show that this choice of $x,y$ satisfies the conditions we seek.\n\nWe let $k_1,k_2$ be the total measures of $\\mu_1,\\mu_2$, respectively, so that $k_1+k_2=4k-2$.  When we remove the points $x,y$, we are left with at most two connected components which contain points of $L$.  By the construction of $\\ell$, these have no more than $\\lfloor k_1/2\\rfloor+\\lfloor k_2 /2 \\rfloor$ points of $U'$ each.  We also have the connected components which were connected only to $x$ or only to $y$, but these each have at most $2k-1$ points of $U'$ by the construction of $L$.  Thus, removing $x,y$ gives us the partition we want, since each part contains at most $\\max\\{\\lfloor k_1/2\\rfloor+\\lfloor k_2 /2 \\rfloor, 2k-1\\}=2k-1$.\n\nNotice as well that we may even allow for $U$ to have repeated vertices, and the only change would be in allowing the vertices of $G'$ to preserve such multiplicities in $U'$, and in the definition of $\\mu_2$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Hardness of general Radon partitions}\n\\label{sec:geodetic-negative}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \\ref{thm:onepartition}.]\nGiven a Boolean formula $\\Phi$ in conjunctive normal form, we will describe a graph $G=(V,E)$ and $W\\subset V$ with size ${\\operatorname{poly}}(n)$, where a Radon partition $(W^+,W^-)$ corresponds to a truth assignment satisfying $\\Phi$.  This suffices to prove the theorem, as SAT is a known NP-hard problem, while counting the number of satisfying assignments is known to be \\#P-hard.\n\n\\textbf{Claim.} It suffices to consider $\\Phi$ where every clause contains either all positive literals or all negative literals.\n\nTo prove the claim, suppose that $\\Phi$ is given in terms of variables $x_i$.  Replace every occurrence of $-x_i$ in $\\Phi$ by a new variable $y_i$, and add the clauses $(x_i\\vee y_i)$ and $(-x_i\\vee -y_i)$ for every $i$, which ensures that $x_i$ and $y_i$ have opposite truth value.  In the new formula $\\Phi'$, every clause must have either all positive literals or all negative literals; and solutions to $\\Phi'$ exactly correspond to solutions to $\\Phi$, as desired.\n\nSuppose now that $\\Phi$ takes the form given in the claim, with variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ occurring as positive literals in clauses $C^+_1,\\ldots,C^+_\\ell$, and occurring as negative literals in clauses $C^-_1,\\ldots,C^-_m$.  For convenience, we will also suppose that $\\ell,m\\ge 1$; if this is not true, we may simply add a new variable and a corresponding new clause containing it.\n\nWe now outline the construction of our graph $G$ (shown in Figure \\ref{fig:SAT-graph}).  The vertex set $V$ will consist of the following parts:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the set $W^0=\\{w_1,\\ldots,w_n\\}$, corresponding to the variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$,\n\\item vertices $w^+$ and $w^-$, which will define which variables are True and False, respectively,\n\\item the set $V^+$, which will allow us to calculate which of the clauses $C^+_j$ are True,\n\\item the set $V^-$, which will allow us to calculate which clauses $C^-_k$ are True.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n\\tikzstyle{vertex}=[circle,draw,thick=black,fill=black!10,minimum size=15pt,inner sep=0pt]\n\\tikzstyle{vertex_light}=[circle,draw,thick=black,fill=black!0,minimum size=15pt,inner sep=0pt]\n\\tikzstyle{vertex_dark}=[circle,draw,thick=black,fill=black!30,minimum size=15pt,inner sep=0pt]\n\\tikzstyle{vertex_double}=[circle,draw,double=white,double distance=3 pt,fill=black!30,minimum size=15pt,inner sep=0pt, outer sep = 2pt]\n\\tikzstyle{edge} = [draw,thick,-]\n\\tikzstyle{dotted} = [draw,thin,-]\n\\node[vertex_dark] (w^+) at (-5,0) {$w^+$};\n\\node[vertex_light] (w^-) at (5,0) {$w^-$};\n\\node[vertex_double] (v_0) at (0,16) {$v_0$};\n\\path[dotted] (v_0) -- (w^+);\n\\path[dotted] (v_0) -- (w^-);\n\\path[dotted] (w^+) -- (w^-);\n\\foreach \\pos/\\name/\\option in {{(330:1)/w_1/vertex_dark}, {(90:1)/w_2/vertex_light}, {(210:1)/w_3/vertex_light}}\n    \\node[\\option] (\\name) at \\pos {$\\name$};\n\\foreach \\pos/\\name/\\option in {{(-6,4)/u_1^+/vertex_dark}, {(-5,4)/v_1^+/vertex_dark}, {(-4,4)/u_2^+/vertex}, {(-3,4)/v_2^+/vertex}, {(-2,4)/u_3^+/vertex}, {(-1,4)/v_3^+/vertex}, {(-6,8)/u_{11}^+/vertex_dark}, {(-5,8)/v_{11}^+/vertex_dark}, {(-4,8)/u_{21}^+/vertex}, {(-3,8)/v_{21}^+/vertex}, {(-2,8)/u_{31}^+/vertex}, {(-1,8)/v_{31}^+/vertex}}\n    {\\node[\\option] (\\name) at \\pos {$\\name$};\n    \\path[dotted] (\\name) -- (w^+);}\n\\foreach \\pos/\\name/\\option in {{(1,4)/u_1^-/vertex}, {(2,4)/v_1^-/vertex}, {(3,4)/u_2^-/vertex_light}, {(4,4)/v_2^-/vertex_light}, {(5,4)/u_3^-/vertex_light}, {(6,4)/v_3^-/vertex_light}, {(1,8)/u_{11}^-/vertex}, {(2,8)/v_{11}^-/vertex}, {(3,8)/u_{21}^-/vertex_light}, {(4,8)/v_{21}^-/vertex_light}, {(5,8)/u_{22}^-/vertex_light}, {(6,8)/v_{22}^-/vertex_light}, {(7,8)/u_{32}^-/vertex_light}, {(8,8)/v_{32}^-/vertex_light}, {(2.5,12)/c_1^-/vertex_light}, {(6.5,12)/c_2^-/vertex_light}}\n    {\\node[\\option] (\\name) at \\pos {$\\name$};\n    \\path[dotted] (\\name) -- (w^-);}\n\\foreach \\source/ \\dest in {w_1/w_2, w_1/w_3, w_2/w_3, u_1^+/w_1, v_1^+/w_1, u_2^+/w_2, v_2^+/w_2, u_3^+/w_3, v_3^+/w_3,\n    u_1^-/w_1, v_1^-/w_1, u_2^-/w_2, v_2^-/w_2, u_3^-/w_3, v_3^-/w_3, u_1^+/u_{11}^+, v_1^+/u_{11}^+, u_1^+/v_{11}^+, v_1^+/v_{11}^+, u_2^+/u_{21}^+, v_2^+/u_{21}^+, u_2^+/v_{21}^+, v_2^+/v_{21}^+, u_3^+/u_{31}^+, v_3^+/u_{31}^+, u_3^+/v_{31}^+, v_3^+/v_{31}^+, u_1^-/u_{11}^-, v_1^-/u_{11}^-, u_1^-/v_{11}^-, v_1^-/v_{11}^-, u_2^-/u_{21}^-, v_2^-/u_{21}^-, u_2^-/v_{21}^-, v_2^-/v_{21}^-, u_2^-/u_{22}^-, v_2^-/u_{22}^-, u_2^-/v_{22}^-, v_2^-/v_{22}^-, u_3^-/u_{32}^-, v_3^-/u_{32}^-, u_3^-/v_{32}^-, v_3^-/v_{32}^-, u_{11}^+/v_0, v_{11}^+/v_0, u_{21}^+/v_0, v_{21}^+/v_0, u_{31}^+/v_0, v_{31}^+/v_0, u_{11}^-/c_1^-, v_{11}^-/c_1^-, u_{21}^-/c_1^-, v_{21}^-/c_1^-, u_{22}^-/c_2^-, v_{22}^-/c_2^-, u_{32}^-/c_2^-, v_{32}^-/c_2^-, c_1^-/v_0, c_2^-/v_0}\n    \\path[edge] (\\source) -- (\\dest);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\caption{The graph $G$ derived from the Boolean formula $\\Phi = C_1^+\\wedge C_1^-\\wedge C_2^-$, with \n$C_1^+ = x_1\\vee x_2\\vee x_3, C_1^- = -x_1 \\vee -x_2, C_2^- = -x_2 \\vee -x_3$.

The motivation is that in any $2$-partition of $W$ such that $w^+$ and $w^-$ are in different parts, we consider the variable $x_i$ to be True if $w_i$ is in the same part as $w^+$, and to be False if $w_i$ is in the same part as $w^-$.  We will eventually deal with the case where $w^+$ and $w^-$ are in the same part; however, for the moment let us assume that each of the variables is designated unambiguously True or False.\n\nEach vertex $v$ in $V$, with the exception of $v_0$, possesses a parameter called \\emph{height}, denoted $h(v)$.  The height of a vertex is a nonnegative integer, equal to $0$ for $v\\in W^0\\cup \\{w^+,w^-\\}$ and taking on various positive values for $v\\in V^+$ or $v\\in V^-$.  The importance of the height is as follows: Suppose we start out with a subset of the height-0 vertices and wish to find the convex hull of these vertices.  In each \\emph{extension step}, we add all vertices which lie on shortest paths between existing vertices.  Then, we will design $G$ such that in the first extension step we acquire only height-1 vertices, in the second extension step only height-2 vertices, and so on.  We will never end up with more height-0 vertices than we started with, or with more height-$t$ vertices than we acquired at extension step $t$.  This means that we will be able to analyze the process of building the convex hull, one extension step at a time.\n\nIn addition to this property, we will construct $G$ with the following property: The convex hull of a subset of $W$ contains a vertex of $V^+\\setminus \\{v_0\\}$ only if it contains $w^+$; likewise it contains a vertex of $V^-\\setminus \\{v_0\\}$ only if it contains $w^-$.  Intuitively, $V^+$ is the part of the graph that handles True variables, and $V^-$ is the part of the graph that handles False variables.  We will now present the structure of $V^+$ and $V^-$.  Given a partition of $W$ in which $w^+$ and $w^-$ lie in different parts, we will refer to the convex hull of the part with $w^+$ as the \\emph{positive convex hull}, and likewise define the \\emph{negative convex hull}.\n\nAt height 1 in $G$, we define vertices corresponding to two copies of each literal:\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "$$u_1^+,v_1^+,u_2^+,v_2^+,\\ldots,u_n^+,v_n^+\\in V^+\\hskip .2 in \\text{and} \\hskip .2 in u_1^-,v_1^-,u_2^-,v_2^-,\\ldots,u_n^-,v_n^-\\in V^-.$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"u_{1}^{+},v_{1}^{+},u_{2}^{+},v_{2}^{+},\\ldots,u_{n}^{+},v_{n}^{+}\\in V^{+}%&#10;\\hskip 14.454pt\\text{and}\\hskip 14.454ptu_{1}^{-},v_{1}^{-},u_{2}^{-},v_{2}^{-%&#10;},\\ldots,u_{n}^{-},v_{n}^{-}\\in V^{-}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow><mo>\u2208</mo><msup><mi>V</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003\u2003</mo><mrow><mrow><mtext>and</mtext><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003\u2003</mo><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo></msubsup></mrow><mo>\u2208</mo><msup><mi>V</mi><mo>-</mo></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
