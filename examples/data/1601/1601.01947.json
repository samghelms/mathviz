This duality maps time dependent physics in the gauge theory to time dependent solutions of the Einstein equations in the gravity theory. In order to better understand the process by which ``real world'' theories such as QCD behave out of thermodynamic equilibrium, we study time dependent perturbations to states in a model of a confining, strongly coupled gauge theory via holography. Operationally, this involves solving a set of non-linear Einstein equations supplemented with specific time dependent boundary conditions. The resulting solutions allow one to comment on the timescale by which the perturbed states thermalize, as well as to quantify the properties of the final state as a function of the perturbation parameters. We comment on the influence of the dual gauge theory's confinement scale on these results, as well as the appearance of a previously anticipated universal scaling regime in the ``abrupt quench'' limit.\n}\n\n\\begin{flushright}\nCCQCN-2016-118\\\\\nCCTP-2016-1\\\\\nImperial/TP/2015/CR/01\\\\\n\\vspace*{-0.8cm}\n\\end{flushright}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nThe dynamical properties of strongly interacting matter are interesting both because relatively little is currently known about them, as well as the fact that they are increasingly accessible in the laboratory and large-scale experiments like the heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. One standard method for calculating in strongly coupled field theories is to regularize the theory on a lattice. This method however relies on a Euclidean formulation of the field theory, and hence it is rather difficult to make contact with real-time dynamics. Finding a way around this obstacle takes special importance in the context of ongoing programs in the relativistic heavy ion collisions. At the energy scales currently accessible, the hot, dense matter produced in such collisions of heavy nuclei behaves as a strongly interacting plasma and thus novel theoretical approaches are needed to characterize its dynamical properties. One such approach is based on a holographic duality between gauge theories and string theories illustrated in figure \\ref{fig:thermDual}. This approach was employed in \\cite{Ishii:2015gia} to model the dynamical response of a confining gauge theory at strong coupling, and that work provides the foundation for these proceedings.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n     \\includegraphics[width=.6\\textwidth]{figures/thermDual}\n     \\caption{Cartoon depiction of holographically dual thermalization processes.

At zero temperature, the dual gravitational solution is a horizon-less geometry with a running scalar  and a fairly innocuous naked singularity in the bottom of the throat. Ideally, one would like to perturb this geometry by varying the source for the dual scalar operator in time. This would roughly correspond to driving the system out of its ground state by altering the coupling of a dimension three scalar operator. In practice, the rapidly diverging bulk scalar greatly complicates the numerical analysis and it is necessary to introduce an IR cutoff deep in the throat region of the geometry.\n\nA sensible means for introducing such a cutoff can be found in another branch of solutions to the bulk action.  A particularly well suited branch contains the ``small black hole'' solutions, which shield the singularity behind a very small horizon. These solutions provide initial state candidates in which all bulk fields are well behaved between the UV boundary and the horizon in the IR. In this way the small horizon regulates the IR, but not without introducing some drawbacks.  First, the introduction of a horizon in the initial state obviously renders any  information related to horizon formation beyond the reach of our computations. Second, the small black holes along this branch are never the thermodynamically preferred solutions in the dual field theory. Nonetheless, they have the advantage of retaining much of the flavor of the zero temperature solution (notably a scalar which grows rapidly in the IR) while shielding the numerical methods from the existence of the IR singularity.

Top down models often have the advantage of providing a gravitational theory whose bulk fields are dual to explicitly identifiable operators in  a known boundary gauge theory. Constructing such models with the desired dual physics is typically hard work, however, and  it is often considerably more pragmatic to  employ a ``bottom up'' approach.  In a bottom up model, the scalar potential can be arbitrarily tuned to induce the desired dual physics. The freedom to tune this potential comes at the cost of rigor, as one subsequently forfeits the ability to make detailed claims about the name and operator content of the dual field theory. Nonetheless, in the present case, we will adopt a bottom up perspective and choose $V$ such that the dual boundary gauge theory is confining at low temperatures and such that solutions with non-zero scalar correspond to relevant deformations by a dimension three scalar operator (for details, see \\cite{Ishii:2015gia}).

Since the near boundary region of many holographically relevant spacetimes is asymptotically AdS, abrupt quenches are indifferent to the IR features of the geometry distinguishing different holographic spacetimes.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n     \\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/stTtt4h}\n     \\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/sfTtt1f}\n     \\caption{Final state energy density $\\langle T_{tt}\\rangle$ as a function of quench parameters.

Indeed, in every quench that we have managed to evolve in this system, the thermalization time appears to be controlled entirely by the lowest lying quasi normal mode of the final state black brane.  It is conceivable that this is due in large part to the initial state that we have chosen to perturb. As a consequence of the previously discussed IR features of very small black holes in this model, our numerical stability suffers as the size of the initial state black brane shrinks. On the other hand, it is sensible to expect that the confinement scale becomes important to the characteristics of the dynamical response when it is the dominant energy scale in the problem. Currently, the smallest black hole that we can reliably perturb has an energy density comparable to the confinement scale: $\\langle T_{tt} \\rangle /f_0\\,^4 \\sim O(1)$. Thus, it is perhaps not entirely surprising that the dynamical response of the system does not appear to pass through any regime controlled by this energy scale in our computations.\n\nUltimately, it would be of great interest to perturb initial states with $\\langle T_{tt} \\rangle /f_0\\,^4 \\ll1$, or better yet the zero temperature solution itself. It is within this setting that one expects the response to the quench to be most sensitive to the diverging scalar potential in the bulk, and thus to the confinement scale of the dual boundary theory. Understanding to what extent this scalar potential is similar to the hardwall in its ability to induce scattering solutions which never collapse in the bulk is perhaps the most obvious avenue to pursue. Should such scattering solutions exist, identifying the boundary in the space of quench parameters that separates perturbations which lead to horizon formation from those which do not would permit a scaling analysis analogous to that performed in the well known case of Choptuik phenomena \\cite{Choptuik:1992jv}.\n\nLast, it may prove interesting to investigate the features of other probes sensitive to the quench dynamics in this holographic theory. Some obvious contenders are various non-local probes such as Wilson loops, entanglement entropy, and two point functions of large dimension operators. These operators all share the feature that their holographic computation involves the study of worldlines or worldsheets that sag into the bulk spacetime. As the separation of boundary operators increases, these surfaces generically droop lower in the radial (holographic) direction. In this way, these probes may provide insights into the equilibration of the dual field theory at different length scales, potentially offering a more detailed understanding of the process.\n\n\\acknowledgement\n\nThis work was supported in part by European Union's Seventh Framework Programme\nunder grant agreements (FP7-REGPOT-2012-2013-1) no 316165, the EU program ``Thales\" MIS 375734\n and was also cofinanced by the European Union (European Social Fund, ESF) and Greek national funds through\nthe Operational Program ``Education and Lifelong Learning\" of the National Strategic\nReference Framework (NSRF) under ``Funding of proposals that have received\na positive evaluation in the 3rd and 4th Call of ERC Grant Schemes\".\nThe work of T.I.~was supported in part by the Department of Energy, DOE award No.~DE-SC0008132.\nThe work of C.R.~was supported in part by the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013), ERC Grant agreement ADG 339140.\n\n\\bibliography{bibicnfp2015}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 24977, "prevtext": "\nwhich can be tuned by varying $\\tilde{\\delta}$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}$.
