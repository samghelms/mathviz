We explore the limitations of this assumption using high-cadence GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*.  We employ analytic models that capture the basic characteristics of the images to understand the origin of the variability in the simulated visibility amplitudes. We find that, in all simulations, the visibility amplitudes for baselines oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of the black hole typically decrease smoothly over baseline lengths that are comparable to those of the EHT. On the other hand, the visibility amplitudes for baselines oriented parallel to the spin axis show significant structure with one or more minima.  This suggests that fitting EHT observations with geometric models will lead to reasonably accurate determination of the orientation of the black-hole on the plane of the sky. However, in the disk-dominated models, the locations and depths of the minima in the visibility amplitudes depend primarily on the width and asymmetry of the crescent-like images and are highly variable. In the jet-dominated models, the locations of the minima are determined by the separation of the two image components but their depths depend primarily on the relative brightness of the two components and are also variable. This suggests that using time-independent models to infer additional black-hole parameters, such as the shadow size or the spin magnitude, will be severely affected by the variability of the accretion flow.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{accretion, accretion disks --- black hole physics --- Galaxy: center --- radiative transfer}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[trim=24 24 24 24, width=7in]{f1.pdf}\n\\caption{The 1.3~mm flux as a function of time for the five simulations we explore in this paper (see \\citealt{2015ApJ...812..103C, 2015ApJ...799....1C}). Models A and B, the SANE models, have significant flaring events, shown in grey, which we have excluded from all calculations of averages throughout the paper. The models have a time resolution of $10\\,M$, which is approximately equal to 212 s for the mass of Sgr~A$^*$ and a total duration of $\\approx 60$ hours.}\n\\label{fig:lightcurve}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) experiment with baselines ranging from Arizona to California and from the South Pole to Europe, will, for the first time, be able to resolve black holes at horizon scales (see, e.g., \\citealt{2009astro2010S..68D}). \nThis will not only allow us to test theories of accretion physics but will also give us an unprecedented look at general relativistic effects in the strong field regime \\citep{2011JPhCS.283a2030P}. \nSagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr~A$^*$), the black hole at the center of our galaxy, is one of the primary targets for the EHT. \nIt has a large angular size, a well constrained mass and distance \\citep{2008ApJ...689.1044G, 2009ApJ...692.1075G}, and a broadband spectrum that has been studied for more than a decade (see \\citealt{2001Natur.413...45B} and \\citealt{2003Natur.425..934G} for early studies). \n\nThe source-integrated monochromatic flux of Sgr~A$^*$ has been observed to be variable at many wavelengths including at 1.3~mm, the wavelength at which the EHT will operate \\citep[e.g.,][]{2008ApJ...682..373M, 2008A&A...488..549P, 2009ApJ...691.1021D}. \nIn a previous paper, we studied the large scale variability as a function of wavelength for the source-integrated monochromatic flux of Sgr~A$^*$ \\citep{2015ApJ...812..103C} and found two kinds of variability: long timescale flaring events and shorter timescale, persistent variability originating from the turbulent flow. \n\nOur simulations show that both long and short timescale variability occur at event horizon scales. \nThe structure of the emission region, and therefore, the interferometric visibilities predicted by the simulations are highly variable. \nCurrent image reconstruction algorithms rely on the assumption that the black hole image remains stationary on typical observation timescales of a few hours. \nThis means that the resulting image will actually be sampled from different realizations of the emission of Sgr~A$^*$ and that the variability of Sgr~A$^*$ must be taken into account when analyzing non-simultaneous data. \n\nIn this paper we aim to understand the effect of variability on the properties  of the visibility amplitudes.\nTo perform this analysis, we employ our GRMHD simulations with high spatial and time resolution, and long time span that were reported in \\citet{2015ApJ...812..103C, 2015ApJ...799....1C}. \nIn the earlier paper, we made use of the fast ray tracing code \\texttt{GRay} to efficiently integrate null geodesics in a curved space time and to calculate images, spectra, and lightcurves. \nHere, we calculate the visibilities at 1.3~mm for five best-fit models, which were chosen so that their average broadband spectra and image sizes at 1.3~mm match observations. \nWe employ analytic models to understand the behavior and significance of various features in the visibility amplitudes and use our simulations to investigate the ability of analytic models to capture the gross features of the black-hole images.\n\n\n\\section{The GRMHD+ray Tracing Simulations}\n\n \n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f2A.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f2B.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f2C.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f2D.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f2E.png}\n\\caption{The average 1.3~mm images of the five models we consider in this paper.

These models were created using \\texttt{HARM} \\citep{2012MNRAS.426.3241N, 2013MNRAS.436.3856S} for the GRMHD simulations and \\texttt{GRay} \\citep{2013ApJ...777...13C} for solving the radiative transfer equation along null geodesics. We used simulations with a time resolution of $10\\,GMc^{-3}$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M = 4.3\\times10^6\\,M_\\Sun$ is the mass of Sgr~A$^*$, and $c$ is the speed of light. For the remainder of this paper we employ gravitational units and set $G=c=1$. \n\nWe explored a large range of physical conditions by varying the black hole spin ($a$=0 to 0.9), the accretion rate, the magnetic field configuration, and the thermodynamic prescriptions for the electrons used in the plasma models. \nSpecifically, we explored initial magnetic field configurations that led to Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE) as well as to Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) flows \\citep{2012MNRAS.426.3241N}. \nOut of a large number of simulations, we identified five models which best fit the time averaged observations of Sgr~A$^*$  \\citep{2015ApJ...799....1C}. \nThe specific criteria we used to constrain these models are {\\em (a)\\/} a flux and a slope at $10^{11}$--$10^{12}$ Hz that matches observations, {\\em (b)\\/} a flux at $\\simeq 10^{14}$ Hz that falls within the observed range of the highly variable infrared flux, {\\em (c)\\/} an X-ray flux that is consistent with $10\\%$ of the observed quiescent flux, i.e., the percentage which has been attributed to emission from the inner accretion flow \\citep{2013ApJ...774...42N}, and {\\em (d)\\/} a size of the emission region that is consistent with the size determined by the early EHT observations  \\citep{2008Natur.455...78D}. \n\n\n \n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f3A.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f3B.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f3C.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f3D.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=2in]{f3E.png}\n\\caption{The average 1.3~mm visibility amplitudes, calculated by taking the magnitudes of the complex Fourier components of the two dimensional Fourier transforms, of each snapshot of the five simulations shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:lightcurve} and then averaging over the snapshots. \nThe white lines denote the current and future tracks of the EHT baselines as the Earth rotates.

These light curves were calculated by computing the source integrated monochromatic flux from each model for 1024 late-time snapshots for a total duration that corresponds to 60 hrs for the assumed back hole mass. Models A and B have SANE flows and the same plasma model but differ on the choice of black hole spin: Model A has $a= 0.7$, while Model B has $a=0.9$. Both models A and B show large amplitude, short timescale variability that was shown to be consistent with broadband observations in \\citet{2015ApJ...812..103C}. Models D and E have the same black hole spin of $a=0.9$ and the same MAD configuration, but differ on the choice of the plasma model used.\nBoth models D and E show only long timescale, low amplitude variability. Model C consists of a MAD flow and a black hole spin of $a=0$. Model C shows very fast, quasi-periodic, low amplitude variability. \n\nIn order to focus on the persistent variability from the turbulent flow, we ignore hereafter the intervals with large flaring events, shown in grey in Figure~\\ref{fig:lightcurve}. \nThese events were already discussed in \\citet{2015ApJ...812..103C}.   \n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:average} shows the average 1.3~mm images for the five models we consider. \nThe SANE models (A and B) show a mostly connected emission region and appear to have their emission dominated by the disk. \nModels C and E on the other hand show disconnected emission regions and have most of their emission originating from the bases of the jets. \nModel D is a hybrid with a bright peak at the base of the jet (as in Models C and E) as well as a crescent shape (as in A and B). \nThe red circles in the figures have a radius of $\\sqrt{27}M$, i.e., the expected shadow radius of a non-rotating black hole according to general relativity. \nThe images of the black hole shadow for models A, B, D, and E appear shifted to the right and have most of their emission originating from the left side due to Doppler beaming in a Kerr metric. \nThe black hole shadow for model C is not shifted from the center and is much more symmetric than the others because the black hole spin in this model is zero. \n\nAlthough Figure~\\ref{fig:average} shows resolved images of Sgr~A$^*$ at 1.3~mm, the EHT is an interferometer and will measure the complex Fourier components of Figure~\\ref{fig:average}. \nTo explore the properties of the actual observables, we show in Figure~\\ref{fig:averageM} the average 1.3~mm visibility amplitudes for the five models.\nWe calculated these visibility amplitudes by performing, on each snapshot, the two

For example, the spin of the black hole affects primarily the widths of the crescent-like\nshapes of disk-dominated images and, hence, the locations and depths of minima in the\nvisibility amplitudes. However, turbulence in the accretion flow causes both the locations and\ndepths of these minima to be highly variable, effectively masking the effect of black-hole spin\non the image. In order for the EHT observations to lead to accurate determination of the black-hole shadow\nsize and spin, the image reconstruction and model fitting algorithms will need to take into account the variability of the underlying images explicitly.\n\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\nWe thank Ramesh Narayan for collaborative work that led to this paper and for helpful comments and suggestions on the manuscript. \nL.M. acknowledges support from NFS GRFP grant DGE~1144085.\nC.K.C., F.O., and D.P. were partially supported by NASA/NSF TCAN award\nNNX14AB48G and NSF grants AST~1108753 and AST~1312034.\nJ.K., and D.M. acknowledge support from NSF grant AST-1207752 and AST-1440254.\nAll ray tracing calculations were performed with the \\texttt{El~Gato}\nGPU cluster at the University of Arizona that is funded by NSF award\n1228509.\n\n\n\n\n\\bibliography{my,ms}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 32882, "prevtext": "\n\nThe simplified analytic model shows that two Gaussians do not always produce a null in the visibility amplitude. \nFor a given separation $d$ and width ratios $\\sigma_{\\alpha}$ and $\\sigma_{\\beta}$, there is only one value of the ratio of the brightness of the two Gaussians, $A$, that gives rise to a null. \nWhen a local minimum does not reach zero, the properties of the two components of the image affect the depth of the minimum.\nThis is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:2gaussA} for the dependence of the depth of the minimum on the ratio $A$ of the brightness of the two components of the image and, in Figure~\\ref{fig:2gaussS}, for the dependence of the ratio of widths of the two components along the spin axis of the black hole.\nIn our MAD simulations, the relative amplitudes and widths of the two peaks is highly variable;
