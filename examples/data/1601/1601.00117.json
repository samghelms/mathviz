Therefore, many current and future ground-based wide-field imaging surveys have the ambitious calibration goal of ``breaking the 1\\% barrier\", which requires that calibrated broadband photometry is both stable in time and uniform over the sky to $<1$\\% (0.01~mag or 10~millimag) rms precision. These sub--1\\% precision requirements are driven by the specific science needs of photometric redshift accuracy, the separation of stellar populations, detection of low-amplitude variable objects, and the search for systematic effects in Type Ia supernova light\ncurves~\\citep[see more details at e.g., the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Science Book,][]{LSST2009}. \n\nTraditionally, photometry with $\\sim$1\\% level precision is reachable when careful analysis is taken on the flat fielding, such as star flats~\\citep{Manfroid1995}, across a small field-of-view (FOV), and when observations are done under photometric conditions, i.e. atmospheric conditions are stable and free of clouds. Thanks to the continuous and rapid observing cadence of these dedicated surveys, overlapping areas with  multi-epoch observations can be used to calibrate the illumination pattern of the imaging system with a large FOV. Indeed, Padmanabhan et al. (2008) applied the ``Ubercal\" procedure to the SDSS data taken in good photometric conditions and reached rms of 1-2\\% relative photometry. Many other sky surveys, such as Pan-STARRS \\citep{Schlafly2012} and Deep Lens Survey \\citep{Wittman2012} have also adopted this calibration procedure for their photometric calibrations. \n\n\nIn order to maximize survey efficiency, imaging surveys might also be conducted in less than ideal conditions, i.e. cloudy or partly cloudy nights. Again, owing to the overlapping area in multi-epoch observations, the repeated measurements of a large number of stars allow an internal global calibration of the frame-to-frame zeropoint offset \\citep{Glazebrook1994}, which links the instrumental magnitude and natural magnitude of the survey. This zeropoint offset can be a combination of the instrumental zeropoint change, the atmospheric extinction at a given airmass, and cloud extinction. One zeropoint offset is computed and applied to each exposure or each CCD detector, depending on the airmass of the exposure as well as photometric condition. For example, when the airmass is small and the night is photometric, the zeropoint offset could be computed on an exposure-by-exposure level; when the airmass is large or the night is cloudy, then the zeropoint offset could be computed on a CCD-by-CCD level. \\cite{MacDonald2004} used this technique on the global calibration of Oxford-Dartmouth Thirty Degree Survey. \n\nThe Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a wide-area photometric survey of 5,000 square degrees using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) 4m Blanco telescope. DECam is composed of 74 $250\\mu m$ thick fully-depleted CCDs -- 62 for science imaging, plus 12 CCDs for real-time guiding and focus -- with a FOV of 2.2${\\ensuremath{{}^{\\circ}}\\xspace}$ (3.1 deg$^2$ in area) and a pixel scale of 0.26~arcsec/pixel.  \n\n\n\nThe filters are 620~mm in diameter and fully cover the 62 science CCDs.  For further details on DECam itself, see~\\citet{Flaugher2015}. DES has a requirement for relative photometric calibrations: the survey calibrations must be internally consistent both spatially over the survey footprint and temporally over the 5 years of the survey to at least 2\\% with a goal of 1\\% or better. However, one of its four main probes of cosmological parameters -- the Hubble Diagram of Type Ia supernovae -- requires photometric precision better than 1\\% for the 10 supernova fields.   To achieve these relative calibration requirements, DES uses a combination of calibration methods mentioned above. First, star flats are obtained at the beginning of each DES season and during engineering nights in order to obtain robust pupil ghost and illumination corrections for the flat-fielding exposures (G.\\ Bernstein et al., in prep.).  Second, over its 5-year run, DES will cover its full footprint 10 times (in 10 ``tilings'') in each of its 5 filters (DES-$grizY$\\footnote{DECam has seven filters. They are DECam-$u$, DES-$g$, DES-$r$, DES-$i$, DES-$z$, DES-$Y$, and DECam-$VR$. DES has no $u$-band component in its primary survey. However, we include discussion of DECam-$u$ in this paper since it is available for all DECam community users. For simplicity, we will refer to the six bands as $ugrizY$ in the paper.}), and it uses the large overlaps between exposures in different tilings to tie together the relative calibrations globally across the full survey footprint.\nMeanwhile, a sparse grid-work of stars extracted from the multiple DES tilings and calibrated via nightly DES standard star solutions serves both to ``anchor\" the relative calibrations against large-scale (but low-amplitude) systematic gradients that are often inherent to Ubercal techniques and to tie the relative calibrations to an absolute flux calibration (\\citealt{Tucker2007}; Tucker et al., in prep.).\n\nHowever, most of the calibration techniques discussed above  consider only the relative frame-by-frame zeropoint offset and position dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the source color, i.e. grey-scale zeropoint corrections, or grey-term. In reality, variations in the wavelength dependence of the system response (i.e. atmospheric transmission + instrumental throughput) can also induce changes in measuring the brightness of an object that depend on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the object. We refer to such changes as systematic chromatic errors, or SCE, throughout this paper. We use the word ``chromatic\", since this effect could be considered as approximately linear to stellar colors, which is similar to a linear color-term correction (e.g. $c_b$ in Equation \\ref{eq:photocal}) used to transform from one photometric system to another. It is essentially the change of the $shape$ of the system response. At 1\\% level photometric precision, SCE are significant components of the total photoemtric error budget when calibration techniques only include grey-scale zeropoint corrections. In a few previous imaging surveys, SCE have been partially considered. For example, \\cite{Ivezic2007} applied color-term corrections for different transmission curves from six camera columns when making the SDSS standard star catalog for Stripe 82. The Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) built a photometric response map to correct  the non-negligible color-term variations between photometric measurements obtained at different focal plane positions of the wide field imager MegaCam~\\citep{Regnault2009}. \\cite{Betoule2013} also considered such color-term variations in a combined photometric calibration of the SNLS and the SDSS supernova survey. Most past surveys, however, did not include corrections for SCE in their photometric calibration, especially the SCE from the atmospheric variation, as these corrections are small and hard to determine using the data alone. In this paper, we calculate the SCE and show that these errors are caused by not only the non-uniformity of system response function over the focal plane, but also the change of airmass in each exposure and the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the atmosphere over time. We also demonstrate that our calculations match what we observe in the DES data.\n\nWe structure the paper as follows: In Section 2, we discuss possible variations in the system response and define a fiducial system response for the DES natural system. In Section 3, we calculate the synthetic SCE for stellar objects when the system response deviates from a fiducial system response. In Section 4, we compare these synthetic SCE with actual DES data and show the SCE could be corrected using the synthetic SCE when the actual atmospheric transmission and instrumental throughput are measured directly.  We then calculate the synthetic SCE for non-stellar objects, e.g. SNe Ia and galaxies, at different redshifts in Section 5. Section 6 has a discussion of our results and presents our conclusions. \n\n\\section{VARIATION IN THE SYSTEM RESPONSE}\\label{sec:sys}\nGiven a specific flux of an object at the top of the atmosphere, $F_\\nu(\\lambda)$, the total ADU counts $F$ that are measured by a camera with a photon detector (e.g., Charge Coupled Device, or CCD) can be calculated as:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\n\n\\title{Assessment of Systematic Chromatic Errors that Impact Sub--1\\% Photometric Precision in Large-Area Sky Surveys}\n\n\\author{\nT.~S.~Li\\altaffilmark{1},\nD.~L.~DePoy\\altaffilmark{1},\nJ.~L.~Marshall\\altaffilmark{1},\nD.~Tucker\\altaffilmark{2},\nR.~Kessler\\altaffilmark{3},\nJ.~Annis\\altaffilmark{2},\nG.~M.~Bernstein\\altaffilmark{4},\nS.~Boada\\altaffilmark{1},\nD.~L.~Burke\\altaffilmark{5,6},\nD.~A.~Finley\\altaffilmark{2},\nD.~J.~James\\altaffilmark{7},\nS.~Kent\\altaffilmark{2},\nH.~Lin\\altaffilmark{2},\nJ.~Marriner\\altaffilmark{2},\nN.~Mondrik\\altaffilmark{1},\nD.~Nagasawa\\altaffilmark{1},\nE.~S.~Rykoff\\altaffilmark{6,5},\nD.~Scolnic\\altaffilmark{3},\nA.~R.~Walker\\altaffilmark{7},\nW.~Wester\\altaffilmark{2},\nT.

Past and current surveys have achieved photometric precision of 1--2\\% by calibrating the survey's stellar photometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in multiple epochs.  The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only consider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal plane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the source color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the atmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source color-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be considered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper, we examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) as an example. We first define a natural magnitude system for DES and calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric transmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. \nWe conclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass in each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the atmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over the focal plane, can be up to 2\\% in some bandpasses.\n\nWe then compare the calculated systematic chromatic errors with the observed DES  data. For the test sample data, we correct these errors using measurements of the atmospheric transmission and instrumental throughput from auxiliary calibration systems. The residual after correction is less than 0.3\\%. We also calculate such systematic chromatic errors for Type Ia supernovae and elliptical galaxies and find that the errors for non-stellar objects are redshift-dependent and can be larger than those for stars at certain redshifts.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{INTRODUCTION}\\label{sec:intro}\n\nIn traditional astronomical photometry, a set of standard stars, such as those from Landolt's \\citep{Landolt1992} or Stetson's \\citep{Stetson2000, Stetson2005} catalogs, is observed over a wide range of airmasses during the course of a night to calibrate all sources observed on the same night.

However, one of its four main probes of cosmological parameters -- the Hubble Diagram of Type Ia supernovae -- requires photometric precision better than 1\\% for the 10 supernova fields.   To achieve these relative calibration requirements, DES uses a combination of calibration methods mentioned above. First, star flats are obtained at the beginning of each DES season and during engineering nights in order to obtain robust pupil ghost and illumination corrections for the flat-fielding exposures (G.\\ Bernstein et al., in prep.).  Second, over its 5-year run, DES will cover its full footprint 10 times (in 10 ``tilings'') in each of its 5 filters (DES-$grizY$\\footnote{DECam has seven filters. They are DECam-$u$, DES-$g$, DES-$r$, DES-$i$, DES-$z$, DES-$Y$, and DECam-$VR$. DES has no $u$-band component in its primary survey. However, we include discussion of DECam-$u$ in this paper since it is available for all DECam community users. For simplicity, we will refer to the six bands as $ugrizY$ in the paper.}), and it uses the large overlaps between exposures in different tilings to tie together the relative calibrations globally across the full survey footprint.\nMeanwhile, a sparse grid-work of stars extracted from the multiple DES tilings and calibrated via nightly DES standard star solutions serves both to ``anchor\" the relative calibrations against large-scale (but low-amplitude) systematic gradients that are often inherent to Ubercal techniques and to tie the relative calibrations to an absolute flux calibration (\\citealt{Tucker2007}; Tucker et al., in prep.).\n\nHowever, most of the calibration techniques discussed above  consider only the relative frame-by-frame zeropoint offset and position dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the source color, i.e. grey-scale zeropoint corrections, or grey-term. In reality, variations in the wavelength dependence of the system response (i.e. atmospheric transmission + instrumental throughput) can also induce changes in measuring the brightness of an object that depend on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the object. We refer to such changes as systematic chromatic errors, or SCE, throughout this paper. We use the word ``chromatic\", since this effect could be considered as approximately linear to stellar colors, which is similar to a linear color-term correction (e.g. $c_b$ in Equation \\ref{eq:photocal}) used to transform from one photometric system to another. It is essentially the change of the $shape$ of the system response. At 1\\% level photometric precision, SCE are significant components of the total photoemtric error budget when calibration techniques only include grey-scale zeropoint corrections. In a few previous imaging surveys, SCE have been partially considered. For example, \\cite{Ivezic2007} applied color-term corrections for different transmission curves from six camera columns when making the SDSS standard star catalog for Stripe 82. The Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) built a photometric response map to correct  the non-negligible color-term variations between photometric measurements obtained at different focal plane positions of the wide field imager MegaCam~\\citep{Regnault2009}. \\cite{Betoule2013} also considered such color-term variations in a combined photometric calibration of the SNLS and the SDSS supernova survey. Most past surveys, however, did not include corrections for SCE in their photometric calibration, especially the SCE from the atmospheric variation, as these corrections are small and hard to determine using the data alone. In this paper, we calculate the SCE and show that these errors are caused by not only the non-uniformity of system response function over the focal plane, but also the change of airmass in each exposure and the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the atmosphere over time. We also demonstrate that our calculations match what we observe in the DES data.\n\nWe structure the paper as follows: In Section 2, we discuss possible variations in the system response and define a fiducial system response for the DES natural system. In Section 3, we calculate the synthetic SCE for stellar objects when the system response deviates from a fiducial system response. In Section 4, we compare these synthetic SCE with actual DES data and show the SCE could be corrected using the synthetic SCE when the actual atmospheric transmission and instrumental throughput are measured directly.  We then calculate the synthetic SCE for non-stellar objects, e.g. SNe Ia and galaxies, at different redshifts in Section 5. Section 6 has a discussion of our results and presents our conclusions. \n\n\\section{VARIATION IN THE SYSTEM RESPONSE}\\label{sec:sys}\nGiven a specific flux of an object at the top of the atmosphere, $F_\\nu(\\lambda)$, the total ADU counts $F$ that are measured by a camera with a photon detector (e.g., Charge Coupled Device, or CCD) can be calculated as:\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:photeq}\nF = C \\int_{0}^{\\infty} F_\\nu(\\lambda)S_b(\\lambda)\\lambda^{-1}d\\lambda\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"F=C\\int_{0}^{\\infty}F_{\\nu}(\\lambda)S_{b}(\\lambda)\\lambda^{-1}d\\lambda\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></msubsup><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>\u03bd</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>b</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>\u03bb</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00117.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nThe constant $C$ is not strictly necessary for the calibration, as the observations of spectrophotometric standards (such as DA white dwarfs) using the same instrument can tie a specific natural system onto an AB magnitude system without knowing the actual value of $C$ \\citep[see~e.g.][]{Holberg2006}.\n\n\\cite{Stubbs2006} proposed that the process of photometric calibration can be separated into the measurement of the atmospheric transmission and a measurement of the instrumental throughput, so that the system response could be separated as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 21634, "prevtext": " \nHere $S_b(\\lambda)$ is the system response function for a given bandpass $b$.

DES therefore deployed the Atmospheric Transmission Monitoring Camera~\\citep[aTmCam,][]{Li2012, Li2014} in the summer of 2014, preceded by prototype tests in Oct-Nov 2012 and Sep-Oct 2013, to study the water vapor and aerosol at CTIO. aTmCam is a robotic multi-band imaging system. During DES observations, aTmCam takes simultaneous images in four narrow ($\\sim$10~nm) bands centered at 394~nm 520~nm, 854~nm and 940~nm. The aTmCam analysis derives the parameters of the atmospheric transmission models at CTIO including $PWV$ and $AOD$.\\footnote{For more information, please see the cited papers or visit http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/aTmCam.html } $PWV = 3$~mm and $AOD_{550}=0.02$ were the average values at CTIO from those early results. The long-term variation range of $PWV$ and $AOD$ at CTIO is not yet clear, but preliminary aTmCam results indicate that that $PWV$ varies between 0--20 mm and $AOD$ varies between 0--0.2. Using the aforementioned parameters, we generated the fiducial atmospheric transmission $\\phi^{atm}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ using $libRadTran$\\footnote{libRadTran is a collection of C and Fortran functions and programs for calculation of solar and thermal radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, see more details at http://www.libradtran.org/} \\citep{Mayer2005}, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\\subsection{Variation in the Instrumental Throughput $\\phi_b^{inst}$}\n\nInstrumental throughput is a combination of the mirror reflectivity, lens transmission, filter transmission, and detector sensitivity. The $shape$ of the throughput may vary over time as the detector temperature changes or the filter coatings age. It may also have a spatial dependent variation over the focal plane. Furthermore, each CCD has its own response function. DES has deployed a spectrophotometric calibration system (DECal) that scans the instrument response for all bandpasses by measuring the relative instrumental throughput as a function of wavelength~\\citep{Rheault2012}. DECal is used to scan the wavelength range of each filter several times a year, typically during cloudy nights, to monitor the instrumental throughput over time. DECal measurements indicate that the filter bandpass edges vary with focal plane position, primarily with radial position and in $i-$band in particular. This effect is largely due to slightly inhomogeneous filter transmission with incident angle. Here, we define the fiducial instrumental throughput $\\phi^{inst}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ from the results of DECal scans obtained during Sep-Nov 2013. We use the average throughput over the entire focal plane as the fiducial instrumental throughput, which is also shown in Figure \\ref{fig:std_sys}.  \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1}\n\n\\plotone{std_sys_resp.eps}\n\\caption{The fiducial atmospheric transmission  $\\phi^{atm}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ at CTIO (upper curve) and the fiducial instrumental throughput $\\phi^{inst}_{b,ref}(\\lambda)$ of the DES-$ugrizY$ filter bandpasses (lower curves).

We define the synthetic SCE, $\\Delta m$, as:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 28148, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\tau_0$ is the aerosol optical depth at reference wavelength $\\lambda_0$, where $\\lambda_0=550$~nm is a convenient reference wavelength.  The $\\textup{\\AA}$ngstr\\\"om exponent $\\alpha$ is inversely related to the average size of the particles in the aerosol: the smaller the particles, the larger the exponent.  In general, $\\alpha$ ranges from 0 to 3 with typical values around 1 to 1.3, depending on the geographic location. $\\alpha <$ 1 indicates size distributions dominated by coarse mode aerosol that are usually associated with dust and sea salt, and $\\alpha >$ 2 indicates size distributions dominated by fine mode aerosols that are usually associated with urban pollution and biomass burning \\citep{Schuster2006}. $\\alpha =$ 0 and $\\alpha =$ 4 are essentially the two extreme cases of cloud extinction and Rayleigh scattering.\n\nAbsorption by molecules only occurs at specific wavelengths. The strong absorption lines by $O_2$ at 690 nm and 760 nm (Fraunhofer ``B\" and ``A\" bands) are saturated and are closely proportional to the square root of the barometric pressure, so they can be computed and scaled with Rayleigh scattering~\\citep{Burke2010}.  $O_3$ absorption mainly affects atmospheric transmission shortwards of 350 nm and in the Chappuis band (450--700 nm).  The optical depth of ozone scales with the ozone column density. Ozone column density is usually measured in Dobson units (DU). Each Dobson unit is equivalent to a thickness of 0.01 mm of ozone at standard temperature and pressure. $H_2O$ absorption mainly influences the atmospheric transmission at wavelengths longer than 600 nm.  The optical depth can be scaled with the precipitable water vapor (PWV) column density in~mm. \n\nBoth the optical depth and the column density mentioned correspond to the vertical path from the observer's location to the top of Earth's atmosphere. For a given atmospheric condition, the atmospheric transmission $T$ of the light also depends on the airmass of the observation. For molecular and aerosol scattering, the transmission $T$ at airmass $X=1$ and at airmass $X=n$ has the simple relation:\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nT(\\lambda, X=n) = T^n (\\lambda, X=1)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"T(\\lambda,X=n)=T^{n}(\\lambda,X=1)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>T</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>T</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00117.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nThe first term is the change in magnitude for an object with SED $F_\\nu(\\lambda)$ when $\\phi^{atm}$ and/or  $\\phi_b^{inst}$ deviate from fidicual values. We use the SEDs of Main-Sequence stars O5V-M6V from the Pickles Atlas (Pickles 1992) as $F_\\nu(\\lambda)$ for this calculation. The second term is the change in magnitude for a reference star. $\\Delta m  = 0$ when the SED of the object is the same as the reference star. This reference star plays a similar role that calibration stars play in the zeropoint computation from the global calibration or the illumination correction in the calibration procedure of DES. The only difference is that the actual survey calibration stars have a range of colors, and the grey-term correction is derived for the average color of the calibration stars.  We pick a solar-type (G2V; $g-i \\sim 0.6$) star as the reference star, i.e. a G2V star will have zero $\\Delta m$ due to the change of atmospheric transmission and/or instrumental throughput. \n\n\\subsection{Synthetic SCE due to the Variation in Atmospheric Transmission}\nWe first generate a grid of atmospheric transmission curves for a range of airmass, barometric pressure, AOD, $\\alpha$, PWV and Ozone using $libRadTran$.  We then compute SCE due to the variation in atmospheric transmission using Equation \\ref{eq:error}  by varying one atmospheric component at a time but keeping the fiducial instrumental throughput unchanged. \n\nWe calculate $\\Delta m$ when the airmass changes from $X=1.2$ to $X=1.8$. Figure \\ref{fig:error_airmass} shows the ratio of atmospheric transmission at two different airmasses and $\\Delta m$ for O5V-M6V stars introduced by this airmass change, as a function of $g-i$ color. $\\Delta m$ due to the airmass change is more than $\\pm$10mmag in $g$-band for O stars and M stars, and a few mmag in $u$- and $r$-band. $\\Delta m$ in $i$-, $z$- and $Y$-band is small. The SCE due to the airmass change are essentially the ``second-order extinction coefficient\" or ``airmass color extinction coefficient\", which is known to increase towards bluer wavelengths \\citep{Henden1990}.\n\nWe run a similar calculation for the change in PWV from $PWV=3$~mm to $PWV=10$~mm  and show the results in Figure \\ref{fig:error_pwv}. $\\Delta m$ due to the PWV change is mainly in the $z$- and $Y$-band. The errors can be as large as $+$10 mmag in $z$-band and $-4$ mmag in $Y$-band and thus an error of $>$ 10 mmag in $z-Y$ color. As mentioned earlier, molecular absorption does not vary linearly with column density, and therefore $\\Delta m$ caused by a PWV change from  $PWV=3$ mm to $PWV=10$ mm is about the same as that from $PWV=0$ to $PWV=3$ mm or from $PWV=10$ mm to $PWV=20$ mm. \n\nWe also perform a similar calculation for $\\Delta m$ when barometric pressure, aerosol and ozone change in the atmosphere. We list $\\Delta m$ in Table \\ref{table:star_error} for an M6V star ($g-i \\sim 4$) as a summary for all above cases, after the grey-term has been removed using a G2V star. $\\Delta m$ caused by a change of the barometric pressure is very small. An extreme case of the barometric pressure change from 779 hpa to 789 hpa results in photometric errors of no more than 0.5 mmag in any band.\n\n$\\Delta m$ caused by ozone variation is also small; an ozone change from 270 DU to 230 DU, which is an extreme case of the smallest ozone column density measured by the OMPS Nadir Mapper at the longitude and latitude of CTIO, results in $\\Delta m < 1$~mmag in any band, and of only a few tenths of mmag in $g$- and $r$-band due to the Chappuis band. The DECam optics essentially has no throughput below 350~nm, so the ozone variation impact on $u$-band photometry is also negligible. This might not be the case for other cameras with greater response below 350~nm.\n\nThe change in aerosol optical depth affects mostly $g$- and $r$-band. As shown in Table \\ref{table:star_error}, increasing AOD$_{550}$ from 0.02 to 0.20 and keeping $\\alpha$ unchanged results in $\\Delta m=-11$~mmag in $g$-band. If the increase of the aerosol optical depth is due to the larger size of the aerosol particles, then $\\alpha$ would decrease and $\\Delta m$ would be smaller compared to the unchanged $\\alpha$ case. Equation \\ref{eq:aerosol} shows that an increase of AOD makes the atmospheric transmission spectrum redder and a decrease of $\\alpha$ makes the transmission spectrum bluer. Therefore, larger particle size (i.e. smaller $\\alpha$) with larger AOD might introduce very small $\\Delta m$ in one or more bands. AOD and $\\alpha$ are somewhat degenerate for the $shape$ of the atmospheric transmission.\n\nThe synthetic SCE in Table \\ref{table:star_error} are calculated when one of the atmospheric components changes from the fiducial while the other components remain unchanged. Under some conditions, the SCE can be significantly larger. For example, $\\Delta m$ for a PWV change from 3 mm to 10 mm will be much larger than 10 mmag if the airmass is at $X=2.0$ instead of the fiducial $X=1.2$. Of course,  cumulative effects can also be larger.  \n\n\nIn this section, we calculated the synthetic SCE on stellar photometry caused by the variation in the atmospheric transmission. The SCE caused by the variations in barometric pressure and ozone are very small. Variations in airmass and aerosol mainly affect the DES photometry in the $ugr$-bands; variations in PWV mainly affect the DES photometry in the $zY$-bands, as shown in Table \\ref{table:star_error}. This is the primary reason that DES built and deployed aTmCam: to measure the PWV and aerosol at CTIO during DES operations. Furthermore, in order to provide a cross-check of the amount of PWV measured by aTmCam, DES has also installed a high-precision dual-band Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS is used to measure the PWV, as the variation of PWV affects arrival time of the GPS signal via the increased index of refraction~\\citep{Blake2011}. The measured PWV by aTmCam and GPS agrees within the joint uncertainties of the two measurements. More details about a direct comparison can be found in~\\citep{Li2014}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[th!]\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1}\n\\plotone{ratio_tran_airmass.eps}\n\\plotone{error_airmass.eps}\n\\caption{Top panel: The ratio of the atmospheric transmission for two airmass values, $X=1.2$ and $X=1.8$.

For reference, SDSS discovered variations of the instrumental throughput over its survey period \\citep{Doi2010}. Such variations could introduce SCE similar to those caused by the variation in the atmospheric transmission.  DES so far has not seen a variation in instrumental throughput over time from the DECal scans in the past three years; however, data from DECal have shown a shift of either the blue or red edges of the filter bandpasses over the focal plane. \n\nWe shift the fiducial instrumental throughput $\\phi^{inst}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ 2 nm towards the longer wavelength and define it as a changed instrumental throughput $\\phi^{inst}(\\lambda)$. We then calculate $\\Delta m$ due to this shift for O5V-M6V stars, shown in Figure \\ref{fig:error_bandpass_shift} and Table \\ref{table:star_error}. We again use a G2V star as reference to remove the grey term, as this is removed by the illumination correction using star-flats in the calibration procedure of DES. Except for $u$-band, $\\Delta m$ in the other 5 bands are at the level of 1-2\\%. The actual bandpass shifts from the DECal scans in $griz$ bandpasses are roughly 1, 3, 6 and 2 nm respectively, but only one of the bandpass edges shift, instead of both. The $u$- and $Y$-band show almost no edge shift. More details about DECal and bandpass variations will be presented in Marshall~et~al.~in prep.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[th!]\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1}\n\\plotone{bandpass_shift.eps}\n\\plotone{error_bandpass_shift.eps}\n\\caption{Top panel: Solid lines are the fiducial instrumental throughput $\\phi^{inst}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ for $ugrizY$-bands.

The data are transferred in near real-time over the course of each night to the  National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where the DES Data Management (DESDM) team performs an initial nightly processing of the data, including image detrending, cataloging, and astrometric calibration of the individual exposures.  There is also an annual re-processing, which includes a full re-processing of the single-epoch exposures, a global photometric calibration of the data, and a coadd of overlapping exposures.  An overview of the process is described in \\citet{Balbinot2015}, and details can be found in Gruendl et al. (in preparation). The current global photometric calibration only considers the grey-scale zeropoint correction, and therefore the SCE have not been corrected in the current catalog. In order to show that SCE exist in the catalog, we used the calibrated photometry derived using single epoch exposures from DES.\n\nIn this section, we give two examples using a test sample from DES data. We present the SCE due to the PWV variation and due to the location on the DECam the focal plane. We show that SCE in DES observations match synthetic SCE to within a few mmag, which suggests that corrections based on measurements from the auxiliary calibration system (aTmCam + DECal) can be used to significantly improve photometric precision.\n\n\\subsection{SCE due to PWV Variation}\nWe first show how the change of the PWV in the atmosphere affects the photometry in DES. The PWV was measured by aTmCam during DES observations.\n\nStandard star fields are observed on every photometric night in the DES during evening and/or morning twilight.  \\ \nFor one of DES standard star fields SDSSJ2300+0000 ($\\sim$3~deg$^2$), Figure \\ref{fig:pwv} shows the $z-$band stellar photometry difference, $\\Delta z$, between two exposures taken on different nights, as a function of $g-i$ color of the stars. $\\Delta z$ is derived from the photometry in the single epoch catalog from the standard star calibration exposures.  The position of the stars on the CCD focal plane in two standard star exposures is constant to within the pointing error of the telescope (roughly 5 arcsec), so there are no significant SCE from the variation of the instrumental throughput over the focal plane. \\\nThe exposures are selected to be taken at the same airmass to ensure there are no SCE from the airmass change. The selection criteria of -0.002 $<$ $spread\\_model\\_i$\\footnote{Spread model is a parameter measured by SExtractor~\\citep{Bertin1996}. It describes whether an object is better fit by the PSF or a broadened version of the PSF. It may be used as an indicator for star-galaxy separation.\\citep{Desai2012}} $<$ 0.002 and $z < 18$~mag are applied in order to ensure that the targets are all bright stars so that the statistical errors from photon fluctuations are negligible ($<$ 5mmag on average). \\\nWe adopted the $g-i$ color for each star from the photometry in the coadd catalog. Since the coadd photometry is essentially the average over many exposures taken under different conditions, the $g-i$ color from coadd catalog is averaged over different SCE and might be slightly different from the $g-i$ color from a single-epoch. However, this should not be a problem as such a color difference would be a second-order effect to the SCE and should be negligible (i.e. $<1~$mmag).\n\nWe first calculate $\\Delta z$ for two exposures for nights 2014-11-13 and 2014-11-12, which has $PWV=3.6$~mm and $PWV=4.2$~mm from the measurements by aTmCam, shown in the top left panel of Figure \\ref{fig:pwv}; we then perform the same calculation on nights 2014-11-13 and 2014-11-15, which have $PWV=3.6$~mm and $PWV=13.6$~mm, shown on the top right panel. In both cases, there are more than 3000 stars matched from 2 exposures. There is an obvious trend in the top right panel showing that $\\Delta z$ is correlated with $g-i$ when there is a large difference between the PWV values. \\\n\n  We divide these stars into 8 equal-width bins over the range $0.2 < g-i < 3.7$. Except for the last bin which only has about 60 stars, all bins have more than 300 stars.\\\n  We calculate the average of $\\Delta z$ in each bin, shown as the red filled circles in the middle panels of Figure \\ref{fig:pwv}. The error bars show the error of the mean in each bin. On nights with similar PWV, the average of $\\Delta z$ is  consistent with zero for all types of stars, as shown in the middle left panel. \\\n  However, on the nights with a large difference in PWV, the average of $\\Delta z$ deviates from zero for red stars, as shown in the middle right panel. The most significant difference is at $g-i\\sim3.5$, where $\\Delta z$ is almost 4-$\\sigma$ away from zero. This is strong evidence showing the existence of SCE when the PWV changes.  \n  \n  We calculated the synthetic $\\Delta z$ when the atmospheric transmission changes from PWV=3mm to PWV=13mm. We followed the same steps as discussed in Section 3.1, except that instead of using a G2V star as the reference star, we used stars with $g-i \\sim 2$ as reference stars to remove the grey-term variation, as stars with $g-i \\sim 2$ tend to have zero errors in $\\Delta z$ between these two exposures. Furthermore, instead of using the Pickles Atlas, we used the stellar template from Next Generation Spectral Library\\footnote{https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/stisngsl/} (NGSL), which contains flux calibrated stellar templates for more than 350 stars. We note that the synthetic SCE calculated using NGSL and the Pickles Atlas generally show the same trend. As shown in Figure \\ref{fig:error_pwv}, the synthetic SCE using the Pickle Atlas have a few millimag of scatter in $z$- and $Y$-band. We therefore adopted NGSL to compare with DES data as it contains a much larger sample of stellar templates. The synthetic SCE calculated using each stellar template in NGSL are shown as open circles in the middle right panel of Figure \\ref{fig:pwv}.\n  \n  We then fit a third-order polynomial to the computed synthetic $\\Delta z$, and show this curve as a green line in middle right panel of Figure \\ref{fig:pwv}. The difference between the DES data and a fit to the synthetic SCE using the NGSL templates are shown in the lower panels of Figure \\ref{fig:pwv}. The difference is less than 2 mmag over the $g-i$ color range. We emphasize that the fit is $NOT$ to DES data, but rather it demonstrates that the SCE due to the measured PWV change between the two nights are removed exceptionally well.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[th!]\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1}\n\n\\plottwo{same_pwv.eps}{diff_pwv.eps}\n\\caption{Measurements of the differences of $z$-band photometry, $\\Delta z$, on two nights with similar PWV (left) and two nights with different PWV (right), as a function of the $g-i$ color of stars.

Bottom panels: Residuals of the average of $\\Delta z$ in each bin, after corrections with the fit to the synthetic errors (i.e. green lines) in the middle panels.}\n\\label{fig:pwv}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{SCE due to Location on the DECam Focal Plane}\nHere we show how the variation of instrumental throughput over the DECam focal plane affects the photometry in DES. We use $i$-band as the example since $i$-band has the largest bandpass edge shift measured from the results of DECal scans.\n\nWe divide the DECam focal plane into 4 regions based on the location of the center of the 62 CCD chips on the focal plane: Region 1 (0-0.1$R_{max}$),  Region 2 (0.1$R_{max}$-0.3$R_{max}$), Region 3 (0.3$R_{max}$-0.6$R_{max}$), and Region 4 (0.6$R_{max}$-$R_{max}$), where $R_{max}$ is the maximum radius of the focal plane.  The relative throughputs from DECal scans around the blue (red) edge are shown in the top (bottom) left panel of Figure \\ref{fig:pos}. The average throughput in four different regions is normalized to the value at 770 nm. The figure shows that there is about a 6 nm shift at the blue edge when comparing the center of the focal plane to the edge of the focal plane. \n\nWe use the calibrated DES data in the same area as the standard star field SDSSJ2300+0000 to calculate the SCE in $i$-band. We use the single epoch results from the survey exposures instead of the standard star calibration exposures. Since the tilings from the survey exposures have some small spatial offset (i.e. ``dithered\"), each star has been observed multiple times using different regions of the DECam focal plane. The same selection criteria as in Section 4.1 ($-$0.002 $<$ $spread\\_model$ $<$ 0.002 and z $<$ 18 mag) are applied in order to ensure that the targets are all bright stars. We also make an airmass requirement (1.12 $< X <$ 1.22) to ensure minimal SCE from the change of airmass. We then determine the $i-$band magnitude in four regions as described above, $i_1$, $i_2$, $i_3$, and $i_4$ for Region 1 to 4, respectively. For each star observed in Region 4, we find the same star in the other three regions when it is available and calculate the difference $\\Delta i$. We found 291 matches for Regions 1 \\& 4; the differences $\\Delta i_{14}=i_1-i_4$ are calculated and shown in the top left panel of Figure \\ref{fig:error_pos}. We bin the DES data in a similar way as in Section 4.1 and calculate the synthetic SCE using the stellar spectra from NGSL, the instrumental throughputs for Regions 1 \\& 4 from the DECal scans and the fiducial atmospheric transmission model, shown in the middle left panel of Figure \\ref{fig:error_pos}.  A fourth-order polynomial fit to the synthetic SCE is shown as the green line in the same panel. We repeat the calculation and show the $\\Delta i$ for Regions 2 \\& 4 and Regions 3 \\& 4 in the middle column and right column of Figure \\ref{fig:error_pos}. There are 1890 matches for Regions 2 \\& 4 and 4189 matches for Regions 3 \\& 4, respectively. The bottom panels show the residuals of the binned $\\Delta i$ after correction using the fit from the synthetic SCE calculation. We show here that $\\Delta i$ after the correction is less than $<$ 3mmag for any stars at any position of the focal plane.\n\nThe SCE due to position change are essentially the instrumental color-term over the DECam focal plane. It is usually calculated empirically using stars to get the correction to first order. Such empirical linear color corrections are good for stars with $0<g-i<2$. However, for very red stars and non-stellar objects, an empirical linear correction is not sufficient.\n\n \n\\begin{figure}[th!]\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{i_band_edge.eps}\n\\caption{\nThe relative throughput from a DECal scan around the cut-on (cut-off) wavelength in the top (bottom) panel from 4 Regions defined in the text.

Any system that determines the shape of the atmospheric transmission, however, will not produce perfect results and there will be errors in the determined values of the PWV, AOD, etc. Table \\ref{table:star_residual_error} shows the effects of uncertainties in the determination of the important parameters. Notably, measurements of the PWV that are accurate to $\\sim$10\\% generally are adequate to ensure that residual errors after correction are less than 1 mmag in all DECam bands. Similarly, AOD and $\\alpha$ determinations accurate to 0.02 and 0.1 also generally produce corrections that give less than $\\sim$1 mmag residual errors.\n\nMeasurement of the variation in instrumental throughput across the focal plane generally require determination of the wavelengths of any shift in the bandpass to $\\sim$0.2 nm precision. Determination of the bandpass to this level will give $<2$~mmag residual error in most bands. \n\n\\begin{table*}[th!]\n\\small\n\\centering\n\\caption{Residual Errors on a M6V star ($g-i \\sim 4$) when a measurement by an auxiliary instrument has small uncertainties.}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|cccccc}\n\\hline\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Component} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Measured} & \\multirow{2}{*}{True} & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Synthetic Residual SCE (mmag)} \\\\ \\cline{4-9} \n                      &                     &                     & u  & g  & r  & i  & z  & Y \\\\ \\hline\n\\multirow{2}{*}{Aerosol}     & AOD$_{550}=0.02$, $\\alpha=1$ & AOD$_{550}=0.04$, $\\alpha=1$  & $-$0.36 & $-$1.3 & $-$0.68 & $-$0.41 & $-$0.15 & $-$0.02 \\\\ \\cline{2-9} \n          & AOD$_{550}=0.20$, $\\alpha=1$ & AOD$_{550}=0.20$, $\\alpha=0.9$  & 0.47 & 1.4 & 0.58 & 0.28 &  0.08 &0.01 \\\\ \\hline\n PWV       & PWV $=3$ mm    & PWV $=3.3$ mm &  0 &  0 & 0.25 & $-$0.05 & 0.92 & $-$0.27\\\\ \\hline\n\n  Instrument & DECal scan   & shift 0.2 nm & $-$6.9 & $-$1.5 & $-$1.6 & $-$1.9 & $-$1.0 & $-$0.74 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\label{table:star_residual_error}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\\section{SYNTHETIC SYSTEMATIC CHROMATIC ERRORS ON NON-STELLAR OBJECTS}\\label{sec:nonstar}\n\nSince the SED of a non-stellar object is significantly different from a star, the SCE on some of the non-stellar objects can be larger than what we have seen for stars. We show two examples in this section: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and elliptical galaxies. We calculate the synthetic SCE $\\Delta m$ for these two types of objects using Equation \\ref{eq:error}. As the shape of the SEDs changes with redshift, the $\\Delta m$ are also redshift dependent.\n\n\\subsection{Type Ia Supernovae}\nFor the DES survey, the sub-percent photometry precision goal comes from supernova cosmology, which needs precise photometry so that one can measure the luminosity distances of SNe Ia over a wide redshift range. \n\nHere we give an example of how the synthetic SCE change with redshift. Figure \\ref{fig:error_pwv_sn} shows $\\Delta m$ caused by a PWV change from 3 mm to 10 mm for a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) as a function of redshift $z$. We use the SED from SN2011fe \\citep{Pereira2013} as the template for the calculation. The template was taken 0.27 days prior to maximum brightness. The peak-to-valley errors can be as large as 20 mmag for $z$- and $Y$- band over redshift $z=0$ to $z=1$, shown as the blue solid lines. Because a SN Ia SED is very different from that of a star, the SCE for a star and a SN Ia are very different, even if they share the same $g-i$ color. The red dashed lines in Figure~\\ref{fig:error_pwv_sn} show the SCE residuals after naively using the corrections derived from stars with the same $g-i$ color as the SNe Ia, i.e. synthetic SCE calculated in Section 3.1. As the figure shows, the SCE are not properly corrected, and sometimes are even larger.\n\nIn Table \\ref{table:sn_error}, we summarize the synthetic SCE on SNe Ia by the changes of other atmospheric components or by a 2 nm shift. It is similar to Table \\ref{table:star_error} except that the SCE here are calculated as the peak-to-valley SCE over redshift $z=0$ to $z=1$.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Galaxies}\nPrecise photometry helps the determination of photometric redshifts of galaxies~\\citep{Ilbert2006}. We therefore study the synthetic SCE for galaxies. We used a spectral template of elliptical galaxies from \\cite{Coleman1980} for this calculation. We summarize the peak-to-valley SCE on elliptical galaxies over redshift $z=0$ to $z=2$ in Table \\ref{table:elgal_error}. As an example, Figure \\ref{fig:error_bandpass_shift_elgal} shows $\\Delta m$ caused by a 2 nm shift of the instrumental throughput towards longer wavelength, as a function of redshift. The drop of $\\Delta r$ around redshift $z=0.4$, $\\Delta i$ around redshift $z=0.8$, $\\Delta z$ around redshift $z=1.1$ and $\\Delta Y$ around redshift $z=1.3$ are due to the 4000 \\textup{\\AA} break. We again use the correction derived from stars with the same $g-i$ and the SCE residuals after correction are shown as red dashed lines in the same figure.  \n\nSimilar to SNe Ia, the SCE are not properly corrected since the galaxy SED is different from that of a star. However, it is worth noting that the star-derived corrections using $g-i$ color actually slightly correct the SCE on galaxies. For example,  in $griz$-bands, the red lines (after correction) are much closer to zero compared to the blue lines (before correction) for redshift $z<1$. Here, we derive the corrections based on a fixed color $g-i$. This might be good enough for regular stars, as they form a well-defined stellar locus on a color-color diagram. We pick $g-i$ throughout the paper since $g-i$ ranging from $-1$ to $4$ separates the blue stars from red stars\\footnote{For example, $g-r$ is not a good color to pick for red stars since all K and M stars tend to clump around $g-r\\sim1.5$. Therefore, it is hard to correct the SCE on red stars using $g-r$ color.}. However, $g-i$ might not be the best choice for SNe Ia and galaxies. Choosing a color close to the band of interest, e.g., $g-r$ for $g$-band, and $z-Y$ for $z$-band and/or $Y$-band, or choosing a combination of multiple colors, might be better for these non-stellar objects. We leave further discussion of this to future work.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[th!]\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1}\n\\plotone{ratio_tran_pwv.eps}\n\\plotone{error_pwv_sn.eps}\n\\caption{Synthetic SCE in $ugrizY$-bands for SNe Ia as a function of redshift when the PWV in the atmosphere changes from 3mm to 10mm, shown as the blue sold lines.

We assess such SCE for the Dark Energy Survey (DES) as an example: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item For stars, the SCE caused by the change of airmass in each exposure and the change of precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the atmosphere can be larger than 1\\%;\n\\item The SCE caused by the change of the barometric pressure and ozone are smaller than 0.1\\% (or 1 mmag); \n\\item The SCE caused by the bandpass edge shift over the detector focal plane can be as large as a few percent.\n\\item The SCE can be corrected to 2-3 mmag or better if the shape of the atmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput are well measured by auxiliary calibration system such as aTmCam and DECal.  \n\\item For supernovae and galaxies, these SCE are expected to be larger and also redshift-dependent. Figure \\ref{fig:error_pwv_sn} and \\ref{fig:error_bandpass_shift_elgal} give examples of how SCE change as a function of redshift for Type Ia supernovae and elliptical galaxies.\n\\item For stars, we could derive a color term to first order and approximately correct the SCE. However, such linear stellar color terms are not sufficient for getting color corrections for extremely red stars, SNe and galaxies. \n\n\\end{itemize}\nFrom this study, we suggest that, for large imaging surveys such as DES and LSST, one should first define a natural system response that represents the average condition of the survey, and also define a stellar SED as the reference SED that represents the average color of the calibration stars in the survey. Then for each stellar object, one could calculate the synthetic SCE using the stellar SED library together with the stellar color, as described in this paper, and use the synthetic SCE as the corrections. For non-stellar objects like SNe Ia or galaxies, the redshifted SED need to be given as an input to derive such corrections.\n\nEven though SCE are systematic errors for each exposure, they will eventually introduce additional scatter on the final coadd photometry and affect the photometric precision of the surveys with multiple visits. This is true because: 1) the atmospheric transmission varies over a wide range of conditions and each exposure is likely to be taken with a different condition; 2) each exposure in the survey has a slight offset for multiple tilings so that the same object does not fall on the same location on the focal plane. Averaging over different conditions and different focal plane positions can reduce the amount of SCE in the final coadd photometry.  Exceptions include supernovae and other transients, for which there is only one measurement in a particular epoch.\n\nLast but not least, the SCE calculated here are not limited to photometric calibrations in large surveys. They can also be applied to any ground-based differential photometric measurements, such as exoplanet transients. For example, if the planet host is an M6V star and reference stars are G2V stars, then PWV changes over time affect the photometry in $z$-band to $\\sim$ 1\\%, which is comparable or even larger than the signal from a super-Earth transiting an M star~\\citep{Blake2011}. Similarly, variations in either the atmospheric transmission or instrumental throughput can also affect such measurements in other bands.\n\n\\acknowledgements\nThis paper has gone through internal review by the DES collaboration.

We define the six parameters for a fiducial atmospheric transmission curve at CTIO using $X=1.2$,  $P_0=779$ hpa (1hpa = 100 pascal), Ozone column density $=270$ DU, $PWV = 3$~mm, $AOD_{550}=0.02$, and $\\alpha=1$, which are also listed in Table \\ref{table:star_error}. We choose an airmass of 1.2 as one that is typical of observations in DES wide-field survey.\n\n\nMeteorology data from  CTIO show that the average barometric pressure during the year 2014 was 779hpa with standard deviation of 3hpa.  Ozone column density at CTIO ranged from 240 DU to 300 DU with a mean of roughly 270 DU in 2014 according to the NASA Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Nadir Mapper.\\footnote{http://ozoneaq.gsfc.nasa.gov/tools/ozonemap/} CTIO does not have instrumentation to examine  $PWV$, $AOD$ and $\\alpha$. DES therefore deployed the Atmospheric Transmission Monitoring Camera~\\citep[aTmCam,][]{Li2012, Li2014} in the summer of 2014, preceded by prototype tests in Oct-Nov 2012 and Sep-Oct 2013, to study the water vapor and aerosol at CTIO. aTmCam is a robotic multi-band imaging system. During DES observations, aTmCam takes simultaneous images in four narrow ($\\sim$10~nm) bands centered at 394~nm 520~nm, 854~nm and 940~nm. The aTmCam analysis derives the parameters of the atmospheric transmission models at CTIO including $PWV$ and $AOD$.\\footnote{For more information, please see the cited papers or visit http://instrumentation.tamu.edu/aTmCam.html } $PWV = 3$~mm and $AOD_{550}=0.02$ were the average values at CTIO from those early results. The long-term variation range of $PWV$ and $AOD$ at CTIO is not yet clear, but preliminary aTmCam results indicate that that $PWV$ varies between 0--20 mm and $AOD$ varies between 0--0.2. Using the aforementioned parameters, we generated the fiducial atmospheric transmission $\\phi^{atm}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ using $libRadTran$\\footnote{libRadTran is a collection of C and Fortran functions and programs for calculation of solar and thermal radiation in the Earth's atmosphere, see more details at http://www.libradtran.org/} \\citep{Mayer2005}, as shown in Figure 1.\n\n\\subsection{Variation in the Instrumental Throughput $\\phi_b^{inst}$}\n\nInstrumental throughput is a combination of the mirror reflectivity, lens transmission, filter transmission, and detector sensitivity. The $shape$ of the throughput may vary over time as the detector temperature changes or the filter coatings age. It may also have a spatial dependent variation over the focal plane. Furthermore, each CCD has its own response function. DES has deployed a spectrophotometric calibration system (DECal) that scans the instrument response for all bandpasses by measuring the relative instrumental throughput as a function of wavelength~\\citep{Rheault2012}. DECal is used to scan the wavelength range of each filter several times a year, typically during cloudy nights, to monitor the instrumental throughput over time. DECal measurements indicate that the filter bandpass edges vary with focal plane position, primarily with radial position and in $i-$band in particular. This effect is largely due to slightly inhomogeneous filter transmission with incident angle. Here, we define the fiducial instrumental throughput $\\phi^{inst}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ from the results of DECal scans obtained during Sep-Nov 2013. We use the average throughput over the entire focal plane as the fiducial instrumental throughput, which is also shown in Figure \\ref{fig:std_sys}.  \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1}\n\n\\plotone{std_sys_resp.eps}\n\\caption{The fiducial atmospheric transmission  $\\phi^{atm}_{ref}(\\lambda)$ at CTIO (upper curve) and the fiducial instrumental throughput $\\phi^{inst}_{b,ref}(\\lambda)$ of the DES-$ugrizY$ filter bandpasses (lower curves).
