However, phase transition phenomena occur in nature as dramatic qualitative changes of some physical property also very far from thermodynamic limit. Let us think of Bose-Einstein condensation, of Dicke's superradiance in \"microlasers\", of superconductive transitions in very small metallic objects, of the filament-globule transition in homopolymers, of the folding transition in proteins, of a microscopic snowflake melting into a droplet of liquid water, to mention just some examples. \\\\\nThe question was: can we think of a different mathematical approach unifying the description of phase transitions in finite, small $N$ systems with the standard description resorting to the thermodynamic limit dogma? At least for a broad class of physical potentials the answer was in the affirmative as can be seen in Refs.  \\cite{PettiniBook}  and \\cite{TH1,TH2}. \nHowever, in some sense similarly to the Yang-Lee theory for which analytically finding the zeros of the grand partition function is in practice possible only for a few models (essentially given by the Lee-Yang \"circle theorem\"), also the topological approach suffers of computational difficulties, and analytic\ntopological information can be obtained  only for a very few models.\nAlso the direct numerical measurement of topological properties of the configuration space of physical systems faces serious computational issues because of the high dimensionality of the associated manifolds.\nThe idea that some of the mentioned computational obstacles could be overcome comes from the observation of the existence of new computational tools in the fields of discrete geometry and topology. These new methods have already been developed for analysing data in high-dimensional spaces \\cite{Niyogi:2006}. Hence, we expect that they could be useful to investigate topological changes also in physical configuration spaces by identifying their homology from random samples.\\\\\nIn the present paper  we resort to \\textit{persistent homology} analysis. \nPersistent homology \\cite{Ghrist:2008tw,Pers,Top}, a particular sampling-based technique from algebraic topology, was originally  introduced in 2002 \\cite{edels:2002} by Edelsbrunner {\\it et al} with the aim of extracting coarse topological information from high-dimensional datasets \\cite{Niyogi:2006}. \nIn a nutshell, while \\textit{homology} detects the connected components, tunnels, voids of a given topological space, persistent homology computes multi-scale homological features obtained from a discrete sample of a topological space $X$ by foliating it appropriately.  \nHitherto, the study of persistent homology has already proved useful in various fields like biological and medical data analysis, neuroscience \\cite{Petri:2014hq}, sensor network coverage problems \\cite{DeSilva:2007ve}, to quote just a few of them.\\\\\nHere persistent homology is applied to the study of equilibrium phase transitions. Two models are considered for which we rigorously know what to expect: the so-called Mean-Field XY model (MFXY) and the classical lattice $\\phi^4$ model. \nFor the MFXY model both the thermodynamics and the configuration space topology are exactly known, whence the topological origin \nof phase transition is rigorously ascertained; while for the $\\phi^4$ model it is analytically known that the phase transition does not correspond to any topology change in configuration space at any \\textit{finite} $N$ (see Section \\ref{fi4} for a discussion on this model). \\\\\nThe benchmarking so performed gave sharp and unambiguous results in the good direction. \nThis could  open new interesting perspectives for practical applications of the above mentioned topological theory of phase transitions. \n\\section{Phase Transitions and Topology} \nApart from several studies on specific models \\cite{PettiniBook}, \ntwo theorems state that the unbounded growth with $N$ of certain thermodynamic quantities, eventually leading to singularities in the $N\\to\\infty$ limit - the hallmark\nof an equilibrium phase transition - is {\\it necessarily} due to appropriate\ntopological transitions in configuration space \\cite{TH1,TH2}.

This phase transition is due to a spontaneous breaking of the discrete $O(1)$, or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, symmetry.\n\nRecently this model has been proposed as a counterexample of the topological theory \\cite{KastMehta} of phase transitions. In fact, the phase transition of the $d\\ge 2$ lattice $\\phi^4$-model occurs at a critical value $v_c$ of the potential energy density which belongs to a broad interval of $v$-values void of critical points of the potential function. This means that the $\\{ \\Sigma_{v<v_c}^N\\}_{v \\in{\\Bbb R}}$ are diffeomorphic to the  \n$\\{ \\Sigma_{v>v_c}^N\\}_{v \\in{\\Bbb R}}$ so that no topological change seems to correspond to the phase transition.\\\\\nSince then, it is commonly believed that this result undermines the value of the topological theory.\nHowever, this model undergoes a \"mild\" phase transition: being of the same universality class of the  Ising model, also the specific heat of the $\\phi^4$-model diverges logarithmically at the transition temperature both for $d=2$ \\cite{huang} and $d=3$ \\cite{ising3d}, moreover, the microcanonical caloric curve (temperature versus energy) shows a markedly soft transition pattern \\cite{Caiani:1998,CCCPPG} if compared to other models undergoing a continuous phase transition \\cite{PettiniBook}. \\\\\nThis \"mild\" transition is in fact associated with a topological change of phase space and configuration space submanifolds which also is, loosely speaking, \"mild\": it is an asymptotic change of the number of connected components in phase and configuration spaces. It can be shown \\cite{goripettini} that for any time $\\tau_*\\in{\\Bbb R_+}$\nthere exists a value $N_*(\\tau_*)$ of the number of degrees of freedom of the system such that for any \n$N > N_*$ \nwe have $\\dim H_{\\tau_*}^0(\\Sigma^N_E;{\\Bbb R}) = 2$ for $E<E_c$ that is below the phase transition point,\nwhereas for $E>E_c$, that is above the phase transition point, for any $\\tau\\in{\\Bbb R_+}$ and for any $N$ we have  $\\dim H_{\\tau}^0(\\Sigma^N_E;{\\Bbb R}) = 1$; with  $H_{x}^0(\\Sigma^N_E;{\\Bbb R})$ we denote the $0$-th De Rham's cohomology group of the  energy surfaces $\\Sigma^N_E=H_N^{-1}(E)$ spanned by the Hamiltonian flow $\\varphi^H_t$ for a time duration $t\\le x$. In other words, for $E<E_c$ and $t\\le x$ the energy level sets are no longer metrically transitive, that is  $\\Sigma_{E,N}=\\Sigma^A_{E,N}\\cup\\Sigma^B_{E,N}$ with $\\varphi^H_t(\\Sigma^A_{E,N})=\\Sigma^A_{E,N}$\nand $\\varphi^H_t(\\Sigma^B_{E,N})=\\Sigma^B_{E,N}$ such that  $\\Sigma^A_{E,N}\\cap\\Sigma^B_{E,N}=\\emptyset$.\\\\\n The dimension of the the $0$-th De Rham's cohomology group counts the number of connected components. This means that an \\textit{effective} topological change can be seen through the Hamiltonian flow on any arbitrary observational timescale, provided that $N$ is chosen accordingly.

Then  we apply persistent homology analysis.\n\n\\subsection{Samples of the configuration space}\n\nWe begin by  constructing samples of the configuration spaces to be studied.\nFor the MF$XY$ model, this is done by numerically integrating the equations of motion derived from Hamiltonian (\\ref{Hmf}) with the external field set to $h=0$ for a system of $N$ spins, with $N$ up to 6000. \nThe numerical integration is performed by means of a fifth-order optimal symplectic algorithm\u00cd\u0094 \\cite{McLachlan92}. \nWe sampled the configuration space for the following values of the energy density $\\varepsilon=E/N =0.6, 0.75, 0.88$, that is,  below, at, and above the critical energy, respectively. \nThe system is initialized with a Gaussian distribution for both conjugated variables\n$\\left\\lbrace\\varphi_i,p_i\\right\\rbrace$.\nThe total angular momentum ($P=\\sum_{i}p_{i}=0$) is imposed to vanish. \nGiven the initial conditions for the aforementioned energies, the system dynamics is evolved for a $T=1.26 \\cdot 10^7$ time steps, with an integration step of $\\Delta t=0.05$. $6000$ snapshots are uniformly sampled in time after a virialization transient.\nFor the $ \\phi^4 $ model we set $ J=1, m^2=2, d=3$ and $\\lambda=0.1$ in the Hamiltonian (\\ref{Hphi_2}). \nWe consider a 3D cubic lattice with $8^3$ sites,  periodic boundary conditions, and an integration time step $\\Delta t=0.05$. With these parameters, the use of a third order symplectic algorithm \\cite{Casetti:1995} kept the relative energy fluctuations at $\\Delta E/E \\simeq 10^{-9}$.\nThen the Hamiltonian dynamics is numerically simulated at two different values of the energy density, that is, $\\varepsilon =25$ well below the transition energy density $\\varepsilon_c \\simeq 31$ \\cite{CCCPPG}, and $\\varepsilon =35$ well above $\\varepsilon_c$.\n\\vskip -100pt\n\n\\subsection{Persistent Homology}\n\nThe main idea of persistent homology is to build  an increasing sequence of simplicial complexes, called a {\\it filtration} (see \\cite{Pers}), from a \\textit{point cloud}, i.e. set of points embedded in a metric space. \nWe report a detailed mathematical description of persistent homology in the supplementary material and refer the interested reader to \\cite{Pers}. \nHere we streamline  the topological analysis.\nThe standard way to obtain a simplicial complex from a set of points $S$ is to construct its  $\\rho$-Rips-Vietoris complex \\cite{Pers}, an abstract simplicial complex that can be defined on any set of points in a given metric space ${\\cal M}$. \nThe $n$ simplices of the $\\rho$-Rips-Vietoris complex are determined  by subsets of $n+1$ points $\\lbrace p_0,\\ldots, p_n \\rbrace$ such that $D(p_i,\\rho)\\cap D(p_j,\\rho)\\ne \\emptyset$ for all $ i\\ne j \\in \\lbrace 0, \\ldots, n\\rbrace$, where $D(p,\\rho)$ is ball of radius $\\rho$  centered at $p$.\nPersistent homology is a powerful instrument in that it does not \nselect just an $\\rho$ value, but rather studies how the homology of the space, and in particular of the $\\rho$-Rips-Vietoris complexes, changes as $\\rho$ varies.\nAs $\\rho$ is increased, simplexes are added in the $\\rho$-Rips-Vietoris simplicial complex.\nA new simplicial complex is added to the filtration only when a new simplex is born along the (continuous) parameter $\\rho$. \ni.e., the $\\rho$-Rips-Vietoris complex has changed.\nThus the filtration  is discrete: it can be indexed by integers, useful to characterize the topological features of the space.\n\n\\subsection{Simplicial Complexes in configuration space}\n\nIn most applications of persistent homology, the parameter $\\rho $ is taken to represent the Euclidean distance between points in $S$. \nIn the case of physical configuration spaces we replace it by a Riemannian one.\nIn fact, the configuration space $M$ of a standard Hamiltonian systems (that is with quadratic kinetic energy)   equipped with the Jacobi metric \\cite{PettiniBook}, is a \\textit{complete Riemannian manifold}, which means that given any two points there exists a length-minimizing geodesic connecting them (Hopf-Rinow theorem).\nOf course this is also the case of the mean-field  $XY$ and $\\phi^4$ models, \nthus the distance among two points $P_1$ and $P_2$ in $M$ is:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 11202, "prevtext": "\nwhere the {\\em Morse number} $\\mu_k$ is the number of critical points of $\\cal V$\nthat have index $k$  \\cite{milnor}.\n\nAfter a monotonic growth with $v$, a sharp, discontinuous jump to zero of $\\chi (M_v)$ is found at the phase transition point, that is, at $v_c = {1}/{2} + 0^+$.\nHowever, as already shown in \\cite{xymf,physrep},\nit is just this major topological change occurring at $v_c$  that is\nrelated to the thermodynamic phase transition of the Mean Field $XY$ model.\n\n\\subsection{The $\\phi^4$ model.}\\label{fi4}\nThe lattice $\\phi^4$ model is defined by the Hamiltonian \n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n{\\cal H} ( p, \\varphi )= \\sum_i  \\left[ \\frac{p_i^2}{2} + \\frac{J}{2} \\sum_{\\mu=1}^d (\\varphi_{i+\\textbf{e}_{ \\mu }}-\\varphi_{i})^2   -

This phase transition is due to a spontaneous breaking of the discrete $O(1)$, or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, symmetry.\n\nRecently this model has been proposed as a counterexample of the topological theory \\cite{KastMehta} of phase transitions. In fact, the phase transition of the $d\\ge 2$ lattice $\\phi^4$-model occurs at a critical value $v_c$ of the potential energy density which belongs to a broad interval of $v$-values void of critical points of the potential function. This means that the $\\{ \\Sigma_{v<v_c}^N\\}_{v \\in{\\Bbb R}}$ are diffeomorphic to the  \n$\\{ \\Sigma_{v>v_c}^N\\}_{v \\in{\\Bbb R}}$ so that no topological change seems to correspond to the phase transition.\\\\\nSince then, it is commonly believed that this result undermines the value of the topological theory.\nHowever, this model undergoes a \"mild\" phase transition: being of the same universality class of the  Ising model, also the specific heat of the $\\phi^4$-model diverges logarithmically at the transition temperature both for $d=2$ \\cite{huang} and $d=3$ \\cite{ising3d}, moreover, the microcanonical caloric curve (temperature versus energy) shows a markedly soft transition pattern \\cite{Caiani:1998,CCCPPG} if compared to other models undergoing a continuous phase transition \\cite{PettiniBook}. \\\\\nThis \"mild\" transition is in fact associated with a topological change of phase space and configuration space submanifolds which also is, loosely speaking, \"mild\": it is an asymptotic change of the number of connected components in phase and configuration spaces. It can be shown \\cite{goripettini} that for any time $\\tau_*\\in{\\Bbb R_+}$\nthere exists a value $N_*(\\tau_*)$ of the number of degrees of freedom of the system such that for any \n$N > N_*$ \nwe have $\\dim H_{\\tau_*}^0(\\Sigma^N_E;{\\Bbb R}) = 2$ for $E<E_c$ that is below the phase transition point,\nwhereas for $E>E_c$, that is above the phase transition point, for any $\\tau\\in{\\Bbb R_+}$ and for any $N$ we have  $\\dim H_{\\tau}^0(\\Sigma^N_E;{\\Bbb R}) = 1$; with  $H_{x}^0(\\Sigma^N_E;{\\Bbb R})$ we denote the $0$-th De Rham's cohomology group of the  energy surfaces $\\Sigma^N_E=H_N^{-1}(E)$ spanned by the Hamiltonian flow $\\varphi^H_t$ for a time duration $t\\le x$. In other words, for $E<E_c$ and $t\\le x$ the energy level sets are no longer metrically transitive, that is  $\\Sigma_{E,N}=\\Sigma^A_{E,N}\\cup\\Sigma^B_{E,N}$ with $\\varphi^H_t(\\Sigma^A_{E,N})=\\Sigma^A_{E,N}$\nand $\\varphi^H_t(\\Sigma^B_{E,N})=\\Sigma^B_{E,N}$ such that  $\\Sigma^A_{E,N}\\cap\\Sigma^B_{E,N}=\\emptyset$.\\\\\n The dimension of the the $0$-th De Rham's cohomology group counts the number of connected components. This means that an \\textit{effective} topological change can be seen through the Hamiltonian flow on any arbitrary observational timescale, provided that $N$ is chosen accordingly.

The results we present are obtained from 20 different sub-samples, each containing 300 points. \n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\nPersistent homology computes the generators of topological features (homology groups) persisting across different scales and assigns them birth and death values related to their points of appearance and disappearance along the filtration.  \nThat is, when the radius $\\rho$ of the balls varies, for any persistent generator $g$  (see Appendix for the formal definition) we have the value of the parameter  $\\rho$ of the filtration where $g$ first appears (birth index indicated by $\\beta_{g}$) and  the value where it disappears (death index indicated by $\\delta_{g}$).\nIn this way, connected components, one-dimensional cycles, three-dimensional voids and similar higher order structures of the topological space ${\\cal M}$ acquire a weight proportional to the length of their  persistence interval, $\\pi_g  = \\delta_g - \\beta_g$.\nNote that for $H_0$, $\\pi_g = \\delta_g$, because all (dis)connected components are already present at the beginning.  \nFor higher order homology groups $H_k$ the generators can instead appear and disappear freely along the filtration.\n\nIn Figures \\ref{subfigg} and \\ref{subfigf} the basic descriptors of persistent homology, that is, persistence diagrams, are displayed for the $H_1$ generators of the $MFXY$ model and of the $\\phi^4$ model, respectively. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hskip -0.6truecm\\includegraphics[width=0.54\\textwidth]{PDaggr_hmf_extended.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) Persistence diagram for the $MFXY$ model. $H_1$ persistence distributions below ($\\varepsilon =0.6$), at ($\\varepsilon =0.75$), and above ($\\varepsilon =0.88$) the phase transition.  }\n   \\label{subfigg}\n\\end{figure}  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{PDaggr_phi4_extended.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) Persistence diagram for the $\\phi^4$ model.  $H_1$ persistence distributions below ($\\varepsilon =25$) and above ($\\varepsilon =35$) the phase transition.  }\n   \\label{subfigf}\n\\end{figure}  \n\nUsually one considers important topological features to be those associated with generators of $H_n$ such that their $\\pi_g$ is large with respect to some meaningful length. \\\\\nIn our case  we do not have a given reference scale.  \nWe can however compare the results obtained at energies below and above the transition energy in order to look for topological signatures of a phase transition. \nWe show the distributions of $\\delta_g$ for the $H_0$ generators of the $MFXY$ model (Fig. \\ref{figa}) and of the $\\phi^4$ model (Fig. \\ref{figb}).\nIn the former case, as the energy is increased, the peak of the distribution $\\delta_g$ of $H_0$ becomes progressively narrower and centred at larger $\\rho$-values. \nTo the contrary, in the latter case  the peak of the distribution shifts to larger $\\rho$ values at higher energies, but it does not broaden. \nIn order to show that this behaviour is genuinely due to topological features and not due to the different geometrical sizes of the point clouds, we take the point cloud at the lowest energy and affinely rescale the point clouds at higher energies as to make them comparable i.e. ($d_{ij}(\\varepsilon) \\to \\frac{\\langle d(\\varepsilon_0\\rangle}{\\langle d(\\varepsilon)\\rangle} d_{ij}(\\varepsilon) $ where $d_{ij}(\\varepsilon)$ is the distance between points $i$ and $j$ for the pointcloud at energy density $\\varepsilon$.).\nIn this way, we can meaningfully compare the persistences of generators belonging to clouds of different size. \nBelow the transition of the MFXY model, the distribution of the $H_0$ persistences of configuration space covers more scales than it does at and above the transition energy, respectively.\nThis broader distribution means that the corresponding point cloud is heterogeneously distributed in the embedding space $\\cal{M}$ compared to the distributions, definitely more homogeneous, in the other two cases. \nNo variation of the peak widths of the $H_0$ persistence distributions is observed in the case of the $\\phi^4$ model.\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{pre_hmf_h0.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online)  Homological features of the $MFXY$ model. \nRaw (inset) and rescaled (main plot) distributions of deaths for the generators of the first homology group $H_0$.\nNote that the width and shape of the distributions \nchange across the transition, becoming more and more narrow as the energy is increased}\n  \\label{figa}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{new_phi4_h0.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online)  Homological features of the $\\phi^4$ model. \nRaw (inset) and rescaled (main plot) distributions of deaths for the generators of the first homology group $H_0$.

Thus, without the rescaling, $\\beta_g$ and $\\pi_g$ would reflect the size of the underlying manifold.\nNote that for the $MFXY$ model the width and shape of the distributions \nchange across the transition, becoming more and more narrow as the energy is increased, while there is no appreciable change in the $\\phi^4$ case. \nThe different topological signatures highlight the presence of a topological change in the case of the MFXY model, that is absent in the $\\phi^4$ model. \nIn Figures \\ref{subfigc} and \\ref{subfigd} the distributions of persistences for the generators of the homology group $H_1$ confirm what is found for $H_0$.\nIn this case the difference in functional forms for the $H_1$ persistence distribution below and above the $MFXY$ transition is even clearer, while, again, we find no differences for the $\\phi^4$ model. \n\nNow let us comment about the hollowness { detected by} the $H_1$ homology group.\nFor what concerns the MFXY model, below the phase transition energy, the $H_1$ persistence distribution displays a long tail which disappears at and above the transition (Fig. \\ref{subfigc}). \nWe observe that the three sets of points superpose for values of $\\pi$ less then approximately $25$,\nthis range of $\\pi$ values, in the present context, can be attributed to what is commonly referred to as noise, whereas larger $\\pi$-values are usually considered as bringing about meaningful topological information. Thus, the stronger persistence of meaningful cycles, which corresponds to the long tail observed below the phase transition point of the MFXY model, certainly probes a change of ``shape'' of configuration space. And this change of shape can be interpreted as the signature of a change of the dimension of high order homology groups. \\\\\nLet us remark that the performed samplings of configuration space submanifolds are definitely sparse and they could not be other then sparse had we taken billions of points. Not to speak of the huge total number of simplexes, growing as $2^N$ with $N$ the number of sample points.\nThis notwithstanding, the results shown in Fig. \\ref{subfigc} clearly tell us that the MFXY phase transition corresponds to a change of the topology of the configuration space submanifolds, in perfect agreement with the available theoretical knowledge.\nThe same concordance is found in the case of the $\\phi^4$ model where we see that the difference in $H_1$ persistences disappears, in perfect agreement with a-priori known absence of topological changes of the underlying configuration space in correspondence with the phase transition.\n\nFinally, in Figures \\ref{persist-land}  and \\ref{persist-land-phi4}  we show the outcomes of a different method of getting insight to the \"shape\" of data obtained by sampling the configuration space of the $MFXY$ and $\\phi^4$ models, respectively. This is the so called \\textit{persistence landscape} which combines the main tool of persistent homology method, that is, persistence diagram, with statistics \\cite{bubenik}. With respect to the barcode or persistence diagram this descriptor has the technical advantage of being a function, thus allowing the use of the vector space structure of its underlying function space to apply the theory of random variables with values in this space.\nTheory and details of this method can be found in Refs. \\cite{bubenik} and \\cite{chazal}. In practice, one proceeds by computing the $H_1$ homology for a subsample of the original dataset, then one associates to each generator a symmetric tent-shaped function peaking in the middle of the persistence interval of the corresponding generators and finally one considers the envelope of the functions defined in this way over all the generators. \nInformally, one can think of the persistence landscape as the envelope of the $\\pi/4$-clockwise rotated persistence diagram (operation that can be given a proper mathematical definition) thus associating a curve $\\Lambda_p(\\rho)$ to each persistence diagram. \nIn our case, we iterated this procedure for the different subsamples, in our case $20$ subsamples, obtaining the curve $\\langle\\Lambda_p(\\rho)\\rangle$ averaged over the samples. Each curve reported in Figure \\ref{persist-land}  reports the results for different energy values: below, at, and above the phase transition point. A marked difference is again obtained above and below the phase transition in the case of the $MFXY$ model, and no relevant difference between the patterns below and above the phase transition in the case of the $\\phi^4$ model, apart from a meaningless translation.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{persistence_landscape_hmf.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online) Average persistence landscape of the $H_1$ homology for the $MFXY$ model. $\\Lambda_p$ is the average function (see text) reported  as a function of the radius $\\rho$ of the balls used to construct the Rips-Vietoris simplicial complex.

In fact, it has been observed that the peculiar dynamical changes occurring at a phase transition correspond to special geometrical changes of the mechanical manifolds. Then it turned out that these special geometrical changes had to be due to more fundamental changes of topological kind. In other words, this theory has deep roots and rather compelling motivations \\cite{PettiniBook}. Moreover, developing this unconventional viewpoint on phase transitions was of prospective interest to tackle phase transition phenomena in finite/small N systems (meso and nanoscopic systems), in the microcanonical ensemble (especially when this is not equivalent to the canonical ensemble), in the absence of order parameters (for example in gauge models, i.e. with local symmetries), in amorphous and disordered materials, in polymers and proteins, in biophysical systems, in strongly \ninhomogeneous systems. However, as mentioned in the Introduction, computational difficulties have frustrated these expectations.\\\\\nNow the results reported in the present work show that persistent homology, by providing handy computational tools (which are presently available as open access software packages),  can lend new credit to  the prospective practical interest of the topological theory of phase transitions.\nAnd, especially, since improvements of the numerical algorithms are continuously underway. \n\nMoreover, this opens many fascinating and challenging questions related with the mentioned necessarily sparse sampling of high dimensional manifolds.\nIt is not out of place to mention that this situation is reminiscent of Montecarlo methods which typically allow efficient estimates of multiple integrals in high dimensional spaces with very sparse samplings.\nMontecarlo methods owe their efficacy to the so called \\textit{importance sampling} technique, suggesting that further developments in the proposed application of the persistent homology could be found in a somewhat similar direction.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nThis work\twas supported by the Seventh Framework Programme for Research of the European Commission under FET-Open grant TOPDRIM (Grant No. FP7-ICT-318121).\n\\end{acknowledgements}\n\n\\section{Appendix}\n\n\n\\subsection{Simplicial Complexes}\nWe can see a simplicial complex $X$ as a set of polyhedrons (convex hulls of linearly independent points: points, lines, triangles, tetrahedra, and higer dimensional equivalents) in ${\\mathbb{R}}^N$ attached in a good way, i.e., the intersection of two polyhedrons is empty or a face of the two and all the faces of a polyhedron of $X$ is also a polyhedron of $X$.\nWe can also think of simplicial complexes as abstract sets, with the definition:\n\\begin{definition}\nAn (abstract) \\emph{simplicial complex} is a non empty family $X$ of finite subsets, called faces, of a vertex set $V$ such that $\\sigma\\subset \\tau \\in X$ implies that $\\sigma \\in X.$\n\\end{definition}\nWe assume that the vertex set is finite and totally ordered. A face of $n+1$ vertices is called $n-$face, denoted by $[p_{0},\\ldots, p_{n}]$, and $n$ is its dimension. We set, as usual, the dimension of the empty set as -1. \nThe \\textit{dimension} of a simplicial complex is the highest dimension of the faces in the complex.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{simplicial_complex.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) A graphic representation of a simplicial complex}\\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Simplicial Homology}\nLet us fix a field $k$. In the following, by vector space we intend $k-$vector space. \nGiven a simplicial complex $X$ of dimension $d$, for any $n$ such that $0\\leq n \\leq d$ consider the vector space ${\\mathrm{C}}_n:={\\mathrm{C}}_n(X)$ of all the linear combinations of $n$-faces of $X$ with coefficients in $k$. Elements in ${\\mathrm{C}}_n$ are called $n$\\textit{-chains}.\\\\\n\nThe \\textit{boundary} operators are the linear maps sending a $n$-face to the alternate sum of its $(n-1)$-faces, i.e.,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\partial_n: {\\mathrm{C}}_n & \\longrightarrow & {\\mathrm{C}}_{n-1}\\\\\n\\text{[}p_{0},\\ldots, p_{n}\\text{]} & \\rightarrow & \\sum_{j=0}^n(-1)^i\\text{[}p_{0}, \\ldots, p_{{j-1}}, p_{{j+1}},\\ldots, p_{n}\\text{]}.\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nThey share the property $\\partial_{n-1}\\circ\\partial_n=0$. The subspace $\\ker\\partial_n$ of ${\\mathrm{C}}_n$ is called the vector space of $n$-\\textit{cycles} and denoted by ${\\mathrm{Z}}_n:={\\mathrm{Z}}_n(X)$, with by convention ${\\mathrm{Z}}_0 = \\emptyset$.\nThe subspace  $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\partial_{n+1}$ of ${\\mathrm{C}}_n$, is called the vector space of $n$-\\textit{boundaries} and denoted by ${\\mathrm{B}}_n:={\\mathrm{B}}_n(X)$, with by convention ${\\mathrm{B}}_d = \\emptyset$. The property $\\partial_{n-1}\\circ\\partial_n=0$ is then equivalent to ${\\mathrm{B}}_n\\subseteq {\\mathrm{Z}}_n$ for all $n$.\n\\begin{definition}\nFor $0 \\leqslant n \\leqslant d$, the $n-$th simplicial homology space of $X$, with coefficients in $k$, is the vector space ${\\mathrm{H}}_n:={\\mathrm{H}}_n(X):={\\mathrm{Z}}_n/{\\mathrm{B}}_n$.\nWe denote by $\\beta_n:=\\beta_n(X)$ the dimension of ${\\mathrm{H}}_n$ which is usually called the $n$-th Betti number of $X$. \n\\end{definition}\nLet us see two examples.\nFirst, let us consider the simplicial complex $X$ consisting of a triangle $[p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}]$ and all its edges and vertices (i.e., $X=\\{[p_1p_2p_3],[p_1p_2],[p_1p_3],[p_2p_3],[p_1],[p_2],[p_3]\\}$).

In conclusion, the homology spaces characterize the presence of holes in simplicial complexes.\nIndeed, the $0$-th Betti number is the number of connected components of $X$, the first Betti number is the number of generators of two dimensional (poligonal) holes, the third Betti number is the number of generator of three dimensional holes (convex polyhedron), etc.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Persistent Homology}\nThe starting point in persistent homology is a filtration.\nAs in \\cite{Pers}, we call a simplicial complex $X$ filtered if we are given a family of subspaces\n$\\{X_v\\}$ parametrized by ${\\mathbb N}$, such that $X_v\\subseteq X_w$ whenever $v\\leq w$ {\\color{violet} and $X_v$ is a simplicial complex}. \nThe family $\\{X_v\\}$ is called a \\textit{filtration}. \n\nThere are many ways to construct a filtration from a point cloud or a network. The most popular filtration for data analysis is the \\textit{Rips-Vietoris filtration} \\cite{Pers}. \n\nThe Rips-Vietoris complex is a simplicial complex associated to a set of points in a metric space in the following way: every point $p$ is the center of a radius $\\rho$ ball $D(p,\\rho)$ and $n+1$ points $\\{p_0,\\ldots, p_n\\}$ determine a $n-$face in the Rips-Vietoris complex if the corresponding radius $\\rho$ balls intersect two by two, i.e $D(p_i,\\rho)\\cap D(p_j,\\rho)\\ne \\emptyset$ for all $ i\\ne j \\in \\{0\\ldots n\\}$.\nClearly the Rips-Vietoris complex depends on the parameter $\\rho$ and if $\\rho_1<\\rho_2$ the complex with $\\rho_1$ radius balls is contained in the complex with $\\rho_2$ radius balls.\nTo the growth of $\\rho$ we obtain an increasing sequence of simplicial complexes, a filtration, the Rips-Vietoris filtration. In this context persistent topological features of the filtration are considered as features of the point cloud. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.22]{rips_filt.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) Rips Complex Filtration.

Then $f$\ndetermines a linear map between the homology groups $H_i (f): H_i(X)\\rightarrow H_i(Y)$ for all $i$.\n\\end{proposition}\nFrom which it makes sense the following.\n\\begin{definition}\nThe \\textit{persistent homology module} of a filtration is given by the direct sum of the homology groups of the simplicial complexes $H_n(X_v)$ and the linear maps $i_{v,w}: H_n(X_v)\\rightarrow H_n(X_{w})$ induced in homology by the inclusions $X_v\\hookrightarrow X_w$ for all $v\\leq w$. \n\\end{definition}\n\nFollowing \\cite{Pers}, this system is called a module because the direct sum of vector spaces $H_n=\\oplus_v H_n(X_v)$ has a $k[x]-$module structure via an algebraic action given by $x\\cdot m:=i_{v,v+1}(m)$ for $m\\in H_n(X_v)$. The linear maps $i_{v,v+1}$ are not always injective.\nA persistent homology generator is a generator of $H_n$ as $k[x]-$module, i.e an element $g \\in H_n(X_v)$ such that there is no $h \\in H_n(X_w)$ for $ w<v$ with the property that $x^{v-w}h=g.$\nBy the structure theorem on modules over principal ideal domains, the isomorphism class of a $k[x]-$module is completely determined by the degree of each generator $g$ (birth of the generator $\\beta_{g}$) and the degree in which the generator is annihilated by the module action (death of the generator $\\delta_{g}$). The persistence (lifetime) of a generator is measured by $p_g:=\\delta_g-\\beta_g$.\n\nPersistent homology modules can be computed using libraries like {\\it javaPlex} (Java) or {\\it Dionysus} (C++), which are both available from the Stanford's CompTop group website (\\url{http://comptop.stanford.edu/}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\hfill\n\n \n \n\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}\n\n\\bibliography{phase_bib}\n\n\n \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 41190, "prevtext": "\n\nAn important computational issue lies in the size of the produced simplicial complexes. \nIndeed, already for a sample of the configuration space $S$ with cardinality $N=6000$ points, the set of complexes will contain a huge number of simplices hindering efficient computation, since the number of all simplices for all dimensions up to $N-1$ scales as number of subsets of $N$, that is $2^N$.   \nSo, we first restrict ourselves to the study of the first two homology groups, $H_0$ and $H_1$, which allows us to consider only simplices up to dimension $2$ and then adopt a sub-sampling strategy which allows to reduce the dimension of the problem by choosing a representative subset of points $L\\subset S$ without losing important topological features of the configuration space.\nThe sub-sampling is based on a greedy selection of landmark points called \\textit{sequential maxmin} \\cite{DeSilva:2005,gamble}.\nIn sequential maxmin, the first landmark is picked randomly from $S$. \nInductively, if $L_{i-1} $ is the set of the first $i-1$ landmarks, then let the i-th landmark be the point of $S$ which maximizes the distance (\\ref{distance}) from all the points of $L_{i-1} $.\nSince the starting node is chosen at random, the resulting $L$ subsets will change if the algorithm is iterated. \nIn our case, this allows us to perform a bootstrap-like procedure, by repeatedly subsampling the full point clouds and then aggregating the homological signatures detected. The results we present are obtained from 20 different sub-samples, each containing 300 points. \n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\nPersistent homology computes the generators of topological features (homology groups) persisting across different scales and assigns them birth and death values related to their points of appearance and disappearance along the filtration.  \nThat is, when the radius $\\rho$ of the balls varies, for any persistent generator $g$  (see Appendix for the formal definition) we have the value of the parameter  $\\rho$ of the filtration where $g$ first appears (birth index indicated by $\\beta_{g}$) and  the value where it disappears (death index indicated by $\\delta_{g}$).\nIn this way, connected components, one-dimensional cycles, three-dimensional voids and similar higher order structures of the topological space ${\\cal M}$ acquire a weight proportional to the length of their  persistence interval, $\\pi_g  = \\delta_g - \\beta_g$.\nNote that for $H_0$, $\\pi_g = \\delta_g$, because all (dis)connected components are already present at the beginning.  \nFor higher order homology groups $H_k$ the generators can instead appear and disappear freely along the filtration.\n\nIn Figures \\ref{subfigg} and \\ref{subfigf} the basic descriptors of persistent homology, that is, persistence diagrams, are displayed for the $H_1$ generators of the $MFXY$ model and of the $\\phi^4$ model, respectively. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hskip -0.6truecm\\includegraphics[width=0.54\\textwidth]{PDaggr_hmf_extended.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) Persistence diagram for the $MFXY$ model. $H_1$ persistence distributions below ($\\varepsilon =0.6$), at ($\\varepsilon =0.75$), and above ($\\varepsilon =0.88$) the phase transition.  }\n   \\label{subfigg}\n\\end{figure}  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{PDaggr_phi4_extended.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) Persistence diagram for the $\\phi^4$ model.  $H_1$ persistence distributions below ($\\varepsilon =25$) and above ($\\varepsilon =35$) the phase transition.  }\n   \\label{subfigf}\n\\end{figure}  \n\nUsually one considers important topological features to be those associated with generators of $H_n$ such that their $\\pi_g$ is large with respect to some meaningful length. \\\\\nIn our case  we do not have a given reference scale.  \nWe can however compare the results obtained at energies below and above the transition energy in order to look for topological signatures of a phase transition. \nWe show the distributions of $\\delta_g$ for the $H_0$ generators of the $MFXY$ model (Fig. \\ref{figa}) and of the $\\phi^4$ model (Fig. \\ref{figb}).\nIn the former case, as the energy is increased, the peak of the distribution $\\delta_g$ of $H_0$ becomes progressively narrower and centred at larger $\\rho$-values. \nTo the contrary, in the latter case  the peak of the distribution shifts to larger $\\rho$ values at higher energies, but it does not broaden. \nIn order to show that this behaviour is genuinely due to topological features and not due to the different geometrical sizes of the point clouds, we take the point cloud at the lowest energy and affinely rescale the point clouds at higher energies as to make them comparable i.e. ($d_{ij}(\\varepsilon) \\to \\frac{\\langle d(\\varepsilon_0\\rangle}{\\langle d(\\varepsilon)\\rangle} d_{ij}(\\varepsilon) $ where $d_{ij}(\\varepsilon)$ is the distance between points $i$ and $j$ for the pointcloud at energy density $\\varepsilon$.).\nIn this way, we can meaningfully compare the persistences of generators belonging to clouds of different size. \nBelow the transition of the MFXY model, the distribution of the $H_0$ persistences of configuration space covers more scales than it does at and above the transition energy, respectively.\nThis broader distribution means that the corresponding point cloud is heterogeneously distributed in the embedding space $\\cal{M}$ compared to the distributions, definitely more homogeneous, in the other two cases. \nNo variation of the peak widths of the $H_0$ persistence distributions is observed in the case of the $\\phi^4$ model.\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{pre_hmf_h0.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online)  Homological features of the $MFXY$ model. \nRaw (inset) and rescaled (main plot) distributions of deaths for the generators of the first homology group $H_0$.\nNote that the width and shape of the distributions \nchange across the transition, becoming more and more narrow as the energy is increased}\n  \\label{figa}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{new_phi4_h0.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online)  Homological features of the $\\phi^4$ model. \nRaw (inset) and rescaled (main plot) distributions of deaths for the generators of the first homology group $H_0$.

Thus, without the rescaling, $\\beta_g$ and $\\pi_g$ would reflect the size of the underlying manifold.\nNote that for the $MFXY$ model the width and shape of the distributions \nchange across the transition, becoming more and more narrow as the energy is increased, while there is no appreciable change in the $\\phi^4$ case. \nThe different topological signatures highlight the presence of a topological change in the case of the MFXY model, that is absent in the $\\phi^4$ model. \nIn Figures \\ref{subfigc} and \\ref{subfigd} the distributions of persistences for the generators of the homology group $H_1$ confirm what is found for $H_0$.\nIn this case the difference in functional forms for the $H_1$ persistence distribution below and above the $MFXY$ transition is even clearer, while, again, we find no differences for the $\\phi^4$ model. \n\nNow let us comment about the hollowness { detected by} the $H_1$ homology group.\nFor what concerns the MFXY model, below the phase transition energy, the $H_1$ persistence distribution displays a long tail which disappears at and above the transition (Fig. \\ref{subfigc}). \nWe observe that the three sets of points superpose for values of $\\pi$ less then approximately $25$,\nthis range of $\\pi$ values, in the present context, can be attributed to what is commonly referred to as noise, whereas larger $\\pi$-values are usually considered as bringing about meaningful topological information. Thus, the stronger persistence of meaningful cycles, which corresponds to the long tail observed below the phase transition point of the MFXY model, certainly probes a change of ``shape'' of configuration space. And this change of shape can be interpreted as the signature of a change of the dimension of high order homology groups. \\\\\nLet us remark that the performed samplings of configuration space submanifolds are definitely sparse and they could not be other then sparse had we taken billions of points. Not to speak of the huge total number of simplexes, growing as $2^N$ with $N$ the number of sample points.\nThis notwithstanding, the results shown in Fig. \\ref{subfigc} clearly tell us that the MFXY phase transition corresponds to a change of the topology of the configuration space submanifolds, in perfect agreement with the available theoretical knowledge.\nThe same concordance is found in the case of the $\\phi^4$ model where we see that the difference in $H_1$ persistences disappears, in perfect agreement with a-priori known absence of topological changes of the underlying configuration space in correspondence with the phase transition.\n\nFinally, in Figures \\ref{persist-land}  and \\ref{persist-land-phi4}  we show the outcomes of a different method of getting insight to the \"shape\" of data obtained by sampling the configuration space of the $MFXY$ and $\\phi^4$ models, respectively. This is the so called \\textit{persistence landscape} which combines the main tool of persistent homology method, that is, persistence diagram, with statistics \\cite{bubenik}. With respect to the barcode or persistence diagram this descriptor has the technical advantage of being a function, thus allowing the use of the vector space structure of its underlying function space to apply the theory of random variables with values in this space.\nTheory and details of this method can be found in Refs. \\cite{bubenik} and \\cite{chazal}. In practice, one proceeds by computing the $H_1$ homology for a subsample of the original dataset, then one associates to each generator a symmetric tent-shaped function peaking in the middle of the persistence interval of the corresponding generators and finally one considers the envelope of the functions defined in this way over all the generators. \nInformally, one can think of the persistence landscape as the envelope of the $\\pi/4$-clockwise rotated persistence diagram (operation that can be given a proper mathematical definition) thus associating a curve $\\Lambda_p(\\rho)$ to each persistence diagram. \nIn our case, we iterated this procedure for the different subsamples, in our case $20$ subsamples, obtaining the curve $\\langle\\Lambda_p(\\rho)\\rangle$ averaged over the samples. Each curve reported in Figure \\ref{persist-land}  reports the results for different energy values: below, at, and above the phase transition point. A marked difference is again obtained above and below the phase transition in the case of the $MFXY$ model, and no relevant difference between the patterns below and above the phase transition in the case of the $\\phi^4$ model, apart from a meaningless translation.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{persistence_landscape_hmf.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online) Average persistence landscape of the $H_1$ homology for the $MFXY$ model. $\\Lambda_p$ is the average function (see text) reported  as a function of the radius $\\rho$ of the balls used to construct the Rips-Vietoris simplicial complex.

In fact, it has been observed that the peculiar dynamical changes occurring at a phase transition correspond to special geometrical changes of the mechanical manifolds. Then it turned out that these special geometrical changes had to be due to more fundamental changes of topological kind. In other words, this theory has deep roots and rather compelling motivations \\cite{PettiniBook}. Moreover, developing this unconventional viewpoint on phase transitions was of prospective interest to tackle phase transition phenomena in finite/small N systems (meso and nanoscopic systems), in the microcanonical ensemble (especially when this is not equivalent to the canonical ensemble), in the absence of order parameters (for example in gauge models, i.e. with local symmetries), in amorphous and disordered materials, in polymers and proteins, in biophysical systems, in strongly \ninhomogeneous systems. However, as mentioned in the Introduction, computational difficulties have frustrated these expectations.\\\\\nNow the results reported in the present work show that persistent homology, by providing handy computational tools (which are presently available as open access software packages),  can lend new credit to  the prospective practical interest of the topological theory of phase transitions.\nAnd, especially, since improvements of the numerical algorithms are continuously underway. \n\nMoreover, this opens many fascinating and challenging questions related with the mentioned necessarily sparse sampling of high dimensional manifolds.\nIt is not out of place to mention that this situation is reminiscent of Montecarlo methods which typically allow efficient estimates of multiple integrals in high dimensional spaces with very sparse samplings.\nMontecarlo methods owe their efficacy to the so called \\textit{importance sampling} technique, suggesting that further developments in the proposed application of the persistent homology could be found in a somewhat similar direction.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nThis work\twas supported by the Seventh Framework Programme for Research of the European Commission under FET-Open grant TOPDRIM (Grant No. FP7-ICT-318121).\n\\end{acknowledgements}\n\n\\section{Appendix}\n\n\n\\subsection{Simplicial Complexes}\nWe can see a simplicial complex $X$ as a set of polyhedrons (convex hulls of linearly independent points: points, lines, triangles, tetrahedra, and higer dimensional equivalents) in ${\\mathbb{R}}^N$ attached in a good way, i.e., the intersection of two polyhedrons is empty or a face of the two and all the faces of a polyhedron of $X$ is also a polyhedron of $X$.\nWe can also think of simplicial complexes as abstract sets, with the definition:\n\\begin{definition}\nAn (abstract) \\emph{simplicial complex} is a non empty family $X$ of finite subsets, called faces, of a vertex set $V$ such that $\\sigma\\subset \\tau \\in X$ implies that $\\sigma \\in X.$\n\\end{definition}\nWe assume that the vertex set is finite and totally ordered. A face of $n+1$ vertices is called $n-$face, denoted by $[p_{0},\\ldots, p_{n}]$, and $n$ is its dimension. We set, as usual, the dimension of the empty set as -1. \nThe \\textit{dimension} of a simplicial complex is the highest dimension of the faces in the complex.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{simplicial_complex.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) A graphic representation of a simplicial complex}\\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Simplicial Homology}\nLet us fix a field $k$. In the following, by vector space we intend $k-$vector space. \nGiven a simplicial complex $X$ of dimension $d$, for any $n$ such that $0\\leq n \\leq d$ consider the vector space ${\\mathrm{C}}_n:={\\mathrm{C}}_n(X)$ of all the linear combinations of $n$-faces of $X$ with coefficients in $k$. Elements in ${\\mathrm{C}}_n$ are called $n$\\textit{-chains}.\\\\\n\nThe \\textit{boundary} operators are the linear maps sending a $n$-face to the alternate sum of its $(n-1)$-faces, i.e.,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\partial_n: {\\mathrm{C}}_n & \\longrightarrow & {\\mathrm{C}}_{n-1}\\\\\n\\text{[}p_{0},\\ldots, p_{n}\\text{]} & \\rightarrow & \\sum_{j=0}^n(-1)^i\\text{[}p_{0}, \\ldots, p_{{j-1}}, p_{{j+1}},\\ldots, p_{n}\\text{]}.\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nThey share the property $\\partial_{n-1}\\circ\\partial_n=0$. The subspace $\\ker\\partial_n$ of ${\\mathrm{C}}_n$ is called the vector space of $n$-\\textit{cycles} and denoted by ${\\mathrm{Z}}_n:={\\mathrm{Z}}_n(X)$, with by convention ${\\mathrm{Z}}_0 = \\emptyset$.\nThe subspace  $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\partial_{n+1}$ of ${\\mathrm{C}}_n$, is called the vector space of $n$-\\textit{boundaries} and denoted by ${\\mathrm{B}}_n:={\\mathrm{B}}_n(X)$, with by convention ${\\mathrm{B}}_d = \\emptyset$. The property $\\partial_{n-1}\\circ\\partial_n=0$ is then equivalent to ${\\mathrm{B}}_n\\subseteq {\\mathrm{Z}}_n$ for all $n$.\n\\begin{definition}\nFor $0 \\leqslant n \\leqslant d$, the $n-$th simplicial homology space of $X$, with coefficients in $k$, is the vector space ${\\mathrm{H}}_n:={\\mathrm{H}}_n(X):={\\mathrm{Z}}_n/{\\mathrm{B}}_n$.\nWe denote by $\\beta_n:=\\beta_n(X)$ the dimension of ${\\mathrm{H}}_n$ which is usually called the $n$-th Betti number of $X$. \n\\end{definition}\nLet us see two examples.\nFirst, let us consider the simplicial complex $X$ consisting of a triangle $[p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}]$ and all its edges and vertices (i.e., $X=\\{[p_1p_2p_3],[p_1p_2],[p_1p_3],[p_2p_3],[p_1],[p_2],[p_3]\\}$).
