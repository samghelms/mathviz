We further implement our\nprotocol in our nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system and compare our result with other methods. As a direct application of this result, we show that our scheme can also be used to reduce the number of settings needed for pure-state tomography in quantum optical systems.\n\n\\section{Pure-state tomography using Pauli operators }\n\nWe consider the real span of the operators in $\\mathbf{A}$, and denote it by $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})$.\nLet $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})^{\\perp}$ be the $(d^2-m)$-dimensional orthogonal complement subspace of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})$ inside $\\mathbb{R}^{d^2}$.\nIt is known that a sufficient condition for any pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ to be UDA by measuring $\\mathbf{A}$ is that any nonzero Hermitian operator $H\\in(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$\nhave at least two positive and two negative eigenvalues~\\cite{chen2013uniqueness}.\nIn fact, this is also a necessary condition. Otherwise, if the second-lowest eigenvalue of $H$ is non-negative, then the two states ${\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{\\psi}|}}$ and $H+{\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{\\psi}|}}$ are indistinguishable by only measuring $\\mathbf{A}$ where ${\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}$ is the eigenvector of $H$ corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue. Note that without loss of generality, we can always assume the smallest eigenvalue of $H$ is greater than $-1$ which will guarantee $H+{\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{\\psi}|}}\\geq 0$. A similar argument holds if the second-largest eigenvalue of $H$ is non-negative. We will then look for such sets $\\mathbf{A}$ containing only Pauli operators, for two-qubit and three-qubit pure state tomography.\n\n\\subsection{Two-qubit system}\n\nWe denote the single-qubit Pauli operators by $\\sigma_1=X,\\sigma_2=Y,\\sigma_3=Z$, and the identity\noperator $\\sigma_0=I$.  For a single qubit, it is straightforward to check that measuring\nonly two of the three operators cannot determine an arbitrary pure\nstate. Therefore all three Pauli operators are needed in the single-qubit case.\n\nFor the two-qubit system, there are a total of $16$ Pauli operators, including the identity. These are given by\nthe set $\\{\\sigma_i\\otimes\\sigma_j\\}$ with $i,j=0,1,2,3$. For simplicity we omit the tensor product symbol by writing, e.g. $XY$ instead of $X\\otimes Y$.\nOf these $16$ Pauli operators, there exists a set of $11$ Pauli operators $\\mathbf{A}$ such that $\\mathbf{A}$ is UDA for any pure state, as given by the following theorem.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{th:2qubits}\nAny two-qubit pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is UDA by measuring the following set of Pauli operators.\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:2qubit}\n\\mathbf{A}=&&\\{II,IX,IY,IZ,XI,YX,\\nonumber\\\\\n&&YY,YZ,ZX,ZY,ZZ\\},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand no set with fewer than $11$ Pauli operators can be UDA for\nall two-qubit pure states.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nThis is to say, $11$ is the minimum number of Pauli operators\nneeded to UDA any two-qubit pure state, and an example of such a set\nwith\n$11$ Pauli operators is given in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:2qubit}.\n\n\\begin{proof}\nIn order for $\\mathbf{A}$ to UDA all two-qubit pure states it is known~\\cite{chen2013uniqueness} that any Hermitian operator $H\\in(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$ must\nhave at least two positive and two negative eigenvalues.\n\nIn this case $(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}=\\mathcal{S}(\\{XX,XY,XZ,YI,ZI\\})$. Note that the $5$ operators which are not measured all mutually anti-commute with each other. It is easy to see that this property is required for if two operators in $(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$ commuted, then they would be simultaneously diagonalizable and a linear combination would exist which would have at least one 0-eigenvalue. Since two-qubit Pauli operators only have four eigenvalues total, having a single $0$ eigenvalue fails the UDA condition.\n\nFurthermore it is easy to show by exhaustive search that there exists no set of more than $5$ mutually anti-commuting Pauli operators. So no fewer than $11$ Paulis could be measured.\n\nTo show that this set of $11$ Pauli operators is sufficient to be UDA, we construct a parametrization of all $H\\in(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$;\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 5463, "prevtext": "\nwhere each $A_i$ is Hermitian.

Since $H$ is a $4$-by-$4$ traceless Hermitian matrix, it can only have positive determinant if and only if it has exactly two positive and two negative eigenvalues.\n\nThe same logic follows for any set that is unitarily equivalent to this set. A particular class of unitary operators which maps the set of Pauli operators to itself is called the Clifford group. Thus, the set $\\mathbf{A}$ and any set which is Clifford equivalent to it are our optimum sets of Pauli measurement operators for two-qubit pure-state tomography.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\subsection{Three-qubit system}\n\nThe situation for the $3$-qubit case is much more complicated.\nWe start by noticing that\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV&=&IIZ+IZI+ZII+ZZZ\\nonumber\\\\\n&=&4\\left(|000\\rangle\\langle000|-|111\\rangle\\langle111|\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nhas one positive and one negative eigenvalue. Therefore, if  the set $\\mathbf{F}_{1}=\\{IIZ,IZI,ZII,ZZZ\\}$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})^{\\perp}$, the set $\\mathbf{A}$ cannot UDA all pure states.\nSimilarly any set $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$ which is Clifford equivalent to $\\mathbf{F}_{1}$ cannot be a subset of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})^{\\perp}$. Sets such as these we call failing sets.\n\n\\begin{definition}\nA failing set $\\mathbf{F}$ is a set of Pauli operators such that there exists a nonzero real combination of elements chosen from $\\mathbf{F}$ such that it has only $1$ positive eigenvalue or $1$ negative eigenvalue.\n\\end{definition}\n\nNamely, for an arbitrary pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ to\nbe UDA by measuring operators in a set $\\mathbf{A}$, $\\mbox{span(}\\mathbf{F}_{i})\\not\\subset(\\mbox{span}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$\nholds for every set $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$ that is Clifford equivalent to $\\mathbf{F}_{1}$.\nThus, for all 945 sets of $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$, at least one element in each $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$\nshould be included in $\\mbox{span}(\\mathbf{A})$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{th:3qubits}\nThe following set of $31$ Pauli operators are sufficient to UDA\nany given three-qubit pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:3qubit}\n\\mathbf{A} & = & \\{IIX,IIY,IIZ,IXI,IXX,IXY,IYI,IYX,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & IYY,IZI,XIZ,XXX,XXY,XYX,XYY,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & XZX,XZY,YXX,YXY,YXZ,YYX,YYY,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & YYZ,YZI,ZII,ZXZ,ZYZ,ZZX,ZZY,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & ZZZ,III\\}, \\label{pauli3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand no set with less than $31$ Pauli operators can be UDA for\nall three-qubit pure states.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nSimilarly to the two-qubit case this set is obtained by finding the largest set of Pauli operators which do not contain any of the identified failing sets and taking the complement producing the smallest set of measurement operators which could UDA all pure states.\n\nTo show that this set $\\mathbf{A}$  will be UDA for any pure state, we look at the traceless Hermitian operator $H\\in(\\mbox{span}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$,\nwhere\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nH & = & \\alpha_{1}IXZ+\\alpha_{2}IYZ+\\alpha_{3}IZX+\\alpha_{4}IZY+\\alpha_{5}IZZ\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{6}XII+\\alpha_{7}XIX+\\alpha_{8}XIY+\\alpha_{9}XXI\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{10}XXZ+\\alpha_{11}XYI+\\alpha_{12}XYZ+\\alpha_{13}XZI\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{14}XZZ+\\alpha_{15}YII+\\alpha_{16}YIX+\\alpha_{17}YIY\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{18}YIZ+\\alpha_{19}YXI+\\alpha_{20}YYI+\\alpha_{21}YZX\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{22}YZY+\\alpha_{23}YZZ+\\alpha_{24}ZIX+\\alpha_{25}ZIY\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{26}ZIZ+\\alpha_{27}ZXI+\\alpha_{28}ZXX+\\alpha_{29}ZXY\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{30}ZYI+\\alpha_{31}ZYX+\\alpha_{32}ZYY+\\alpha_{33}ZZI.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\nIt can be shown that $H$ either has at least two positive and two\nnegative eigenvalues or $H=0$ (see Appendix for details). Therefore, set $\\mathbf{A}$\nand any set which is Clifford equivalent to it are our optimum Pauli measurement sets for $3$-qubit pure-state tomography.\n\n\n\\section{Stability of the protocol against depolarizing noise}\n\nBefore we test our protocol experimentally, we would like to understand how robust it is given states that are not pure. Due to noise in the implementation, we often end up with some\nmixed state which is close to our ideal pure state. Therefore, for\nthe protocol to work in practice, one requires it to return a density\nmatrix with high fidelity with respect to our input state when it has high purity.\nWe generate a random pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ from the Haar measure as\nour desired ideal state, then run it through a depolarizing channel\nto get a noisy mixed state $\\rho=\\eta \\frac{ I }{d}+(1-\\eta)|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|$.\nWe could then generate all Pauli measurement results $\\{\\mbox{Tr}(\\rho\\sigma_{k})=M_{k}\\}$,\nwhere $\\sigma_{k}$ is Pauli observable of given dimension. Pick results\ndetermined by our optimum Pauli measurement set, we run a maximum likelihood\nestimation to get a density matrix reconstruction. Our\nprotocol is tested over a range of different $\\eta$, and the\nresults are shown in Figure~\\ref{Fig1}. We can see that for small noise $\\eta$,\nthe simulated state is very close to pure, and the protocol returns a\nhigh-fidelity density matrix reconstruction. As noise $\\eta$\nincreases, the pure state assumption becomes less useful, and our protocol yields\na low fidelity estimation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{ThreeQubitPauliSimulation}\n\n\\caption{The average fidelity of reconstructed density matrices compared to\nthe ideal state using an optimum Pauli measurement set for 3 qubits. The error bars\nare given by standard deviation of the said fidelity over 100 instances. For small noise $\\eta$,\nthe state is very close to pure, and the protocol returns a\nhigh fidelity density matrix reconstruction. As noise $\\eta$\nincreases, the pure state assumption becomes less useful, which yields\na low fidelity estimation. }\n\\label{Fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Experiments in NMR\nsystems}\n\nA nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) system is an ideal testbed for our protocol. However,\nthe creation of a pure state in NMR requires unrealistic experimental conditions such as extremely low temperatures or high magnetic fields, which makes it impractical for a liquid sample. To overcome this problem, one can prepare a pseudo-pure state (PPS) alternatively\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13244, "prevtext": "\nTheoretically, we always have ${\\mathop{\\rm tr}\\nolimits}\\rho=1$, however we keep this entry in\n$\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ for the reason of experimental calibration~\\cite{james01,deBurgh05,vandersypen2005nmr,oliveira2011nmr}.\n\nFor any $\\rho\\in D(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, full quantum state tomography requires\n$d^2$ measurement outcomes to determine $\\rho$~\\cite{NC00}.

As a direct application of this result, we show that our scheme can also be used to reduce the number of settings needed for pure-state tomography in quantum optical systems.\n\n\\section{Pure-state tomography using Pauli operators }\n\nWe consider the real span of the operators in $\\mathbf{A}$, and denote it by $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})$.\nLet $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})^{\\perp}$ be the $(d^2-m)$-dimensional orthogonal complement subspace of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})$ inside $\\mathbb{R}^{d^2}$.\nIt is known that a sufficient condition for any pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ to be UDA by measuring $\\mathbf{A}$ is that any nonzero Hermitian operator $H\\in(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$\nhave at least two positive and two negative eigenvalues~\\cite{chen2013uniqueness}.\nIn fact, this is also a necessary condition. Otherwise, if the second-lowest eigenvalue of $H$ is non-negative, then the two states ${\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{\\psi}|}}$ and $H+{\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{\\psi}|}}$ are indistinguishable by only measuring $\\mathbf{A}$ where ${\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}$ is the eigenvector of $H$ corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue. Note that without loss of generality, we can always assume the smallest eigenvalue of $H$ is greater than $-1$ which will guarantee $H+{\\ensuremath{|{\\psi}\\rangle}}{\\ensuremath{\\langle{\\psi}|}}\\geq 0$. A similar argument holds if the second-largest eigenvalue of $H$ is non-negative. We will then look for such sets $\\mathbf{A}$ containing only Pauli operators, for two-qubit and three-qubit pure state tomography.\n\n\\subsection{Two-qubit system}\n\nWe denote the single-qubit Pauli operators by $\\sigma_1=X,\\sigma_2=Y,\\sigma_3=Z$, and the identity\noperator $\\sigma_0=I$.  For a single qubit, it is straightforward to check that measuring\nonly two of the three operators cannot determine an arbitrary pure\nstate. Therefore all three Pauli operators are needed in the single-qubit case.\n\nFor the two-qubit system, there are a total of $16$ Pauli operators, including the identity. These are given by\nthe set $\\{\\sigma_i\\otimes\\sigma_j\\}$ with $i,j=0,1,2,3$. For simplicity we omit the tensor product symbol by writing, e.g. $XY$ instead of $X\\otimes Y$.\nOf these $16$ Pauli operators, there exists a set of $11$ Pauli operators $\\mathbf{A}$ such that $\\mathbf{A}$ is UDA for any pure state, as given by the following theorem.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{th:2qubits}\nAny two-qubit pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ is UDA by measuring the following set of Pauli operators.\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:2qubit}\n\\mathbf{A}=&&\\{II,IX,IY,IZ,XI,YX,\\nonumber\\\\\n&&YY,YZ,ZX,ZY,ZZ\\},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand no set with fewer than $11$ Pauli operators can be UDA for\nall two-qubit pure states.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nThis is to say, $11$ is the minimum number of Pauli operators\nneeded to UDA any two-qubit pure state, and an example of such a set\nwith\n$11$ Pauli operators is given in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:2qubit}.\n\n\\begin{proof}\nIn order for $\\mathbf{A}$ to UDA all two-qubit pure states it is known~\\cite{chen2013uniqueness} that any Hermitian operator $H\\in(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$ must\nhave at least two positive and two negative eigenvalues.\n\nIn this case $(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}=\\mathcal{S}(\\{XX,XY,XZ,YI,ZI\\})$. Note that the $5$ operators which are not measured all mutually anti-commute with each other. It is easy to see that this property is required for if two operators in $(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$ commuted, then they would be simultaneously diagonalizable and a linear combination would exist which would have at least one 0-eigenvalue. Since two-qubit Pauli operators only have four eigenvalues total, having a single $0$ eigenvalue fails the UDA condition.\n\nFurthermore it is easy to show by exhaustive search that there exists no set of more than $5$ mutually anti-commuting Pauli operators. So no fewer than $11$ Paulis could be measured.\n\nTo show that this set of $11$ Pauli operators is sufficient to be UDA, we construct a parametrization of all $H\\in(\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$;\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:2qubit-proof}\nH=\\alpha_{1}XX+\\alpha_{2}XY+\\alpha_{3}XZ+\\alpha_{4}YI+\\alpha_{5}ZI\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H=\\alpha_{1}XX+\\alpha_{2}XY+\\alpha_{3}XZ+\\alpha_{4}YI+\\alpha_{5}ZI\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Z</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mn>4</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>I</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mn>5</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Z</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>I</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05379.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}$ is the identity matrix and $\\epsilon\\sim10^{-5}$ represents the polarization.

Therefore, the behavior of a system in the PPS is exactly the same as it would be in the pure state.\n\nTo test our protocol, we carried out the experiments in $2$- and $3$-qubit NMR quantum\nsystems, respectively. The qubits in the $2$-qubit system are denoted by the $^{13}$C and $^{1}$H spins of $^{13}$C-labeled Chloroform diluted in acetone-d6 on a Bruker DRX-500 MHz spectrometer, and in the $3$-qubit system by the $^{13}$C, $^{1}$H and $^{19}$F spins in Diethyl-fluoromalonate dissolved in d-chloroform on a Bruker DRX-400 MHz spectrometer.

Equality is reached if and only if all terms in the sum are 0, which only occurs when $\\alpha_1=\\alpha_2=\\alpha_3=\\alpha_4=\\alpha_5=0$. Since $H$ is a $4$-by-$4$ traceless Hermitian matrix, it can only have positive determinant if and only if it has exactly two positive and two negative eigenvalues.\n\nThe same logic follows for any set that is unitarily equivalent to this set. A particular class of unitary operators which maps the set of Pauli operators to itself is called the Clifford group. Thus, the set $\\mathbf{A}$ and any set which is Clifford equivalent to it are our optimum sets of Pauli measurement operators for two-qubit pure-state tomography.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\subsection{Three-qubit system}\n\nThe situation for the $3$-qubit case is much more complicated.\nWe start by noticing that\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV&=&IIZ+IZI+ZII+ZZZ\\nonumber\\\\\n&=&4\\left(|000\\rangle\\langle000|-|111\\rangle\\langle111|\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nhas one positive and one negative eigenvalue. Therefore, if  the set $\\mathbf{F}_{1}=\\{IIZ,IZI,ZII,ZZZ\\}$ is a subset of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})^{\\perp}$, the set $\\mathbf{A}$ cannot UDA all pure states.\nSimilarly any set $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$ which is Clifford equivalent to $\\mathbf{F}_{1}$ cannot be a subset of $\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbf{A})^{\\perp}$. Sets such as these we call failing sets.\n\n\\begin{definition}\nA failing set $\\mathbf{F}$ is a set of Pauli operators such that there exists a nonzero real combination of elements chosen from $\\mathbf{F}$ such that it has only $1$ positive eigenvalue or $1$ negative eigenvalue.\n\\end{definition}\n\nNamely, for an arbitrary pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ to\nbe UDA by measuring operators in a set $\\mathbf{A}$, $\\mbox{span(}\\mathbf{F}_{i})\\not\\subset(\\mbox{span}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$\nholds for every set $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$ that is Clifford equivalent to $\\mathbf{F}_{1}$.\nThus, for all 945 sets of $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$, at least one element in each $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$\nshould be included in $\\mbox{span}(\\mathbf{A})$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{th:3qubits}\nThe following set of $31$ Pauli operators are sufficient to UDA\nany given three-qubit pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:3qubit}\n\\mathbf{A} & = & \\{IIX,IIY,IIZ,IXI,IXX,IXY,IYI,IYX,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & IYY,IZI,XIZ,XXX,XXY,XYX,XYY,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & XZX,XZY,YXX,YXY,YXZ,YYX,YYY,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & YYZ,YZI,ZII,ZXZ,ZYZ,ZZX,ZZY,\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & ZZZ,III\\}, \\label{pauli3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand no set with less than $31$ Pauli operators can be UDA for\nall three-qubit pure states.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nSimilarly to the two-qubit case this set is obtained by finding the largest set of Pauli operators which do not contain any of the identified failing sets and taking the complement producing the smallest set of measurement operators which could UDA all pure states.\n\nTo show that this set $\\mathbf{A}$  will be UDA for any pure state, we look at the traceless Hermitian operator $H\\in(\\mbox{span}(\\mathbf{A}))^{\\perp}$,\nwhere\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nH & = & \\alpha_{1}IXZ+\\alpha_{2}IYZ+\\alpha_{3}IZX+\\alpha_{4}IZY+\\alpha_{5}IZZ\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{6}XII+\\alpha_{7}XIX+\\alpha_{8}XIY+\\alpha_{9}XXI\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{10}XXZ+\\alpha_{11}XYI+\\alpha_{12}XYZ+\\alpha_{13}XZI\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{14}XZZ+\\alpha_{15}YII+\\alpha_{16}YIX+\\alpha_{17}YIY\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{18}YIZ+\\alpha_{19}YXI+\\alpha_{20}YYI+\\alpha_{21}YZX\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{22}YZY+\\alpha_{23}YZZ+\\alpha_{24}ZIX+\\alpha_{25}ZIY\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{26}ZIZ+\\alpha_{27}ZXI+\\alpha_{28}ZXX+\\alpha_{29}ZXY\\nonumber \\\\\n &  & +\\alpha_{30}ZYI+\\alpha_{31}ZYX+\\alpha_{32}ZYY+\\alpha_{33}ZZI.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\nIt can be shown that $H$ either has at least two positive and two\nnegative eigenvalues or $H=0$ (see Appendix for details). Therefore, set $\\mathbf{A}$\nand any set which is Clifford equivalent to it are our optimum Pauli measurement sets for $3$-qubit pure-state tomography.\n\n\n\\section{Stability of the protocol against depolarizing noise}\n\nBefore we test our protocol experimentally, we would like to understand how robust it is given states that are not pure. Due to noise in the implementation, we often end up with some\nmixed state which is close to our ideal pure state. Therefore, for\nthe protocol to work in practice, one requires it to return a density\nmatrix with high fidelity with respect to our input state when it has high purity.\nWe generate a random pure state $|\\phi\\rangle$ from the Haar measure as\nour desired ideal state, then run it through a depolarizing channel\nto get a noisy mixed state $\\rho=\\eta \\frac{ I }{d}+(1-\\eta)|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|$.\nWe could then generate all Pauli measurement results $\\{\\mbox{Tr}(\\rho\\sigma_{k})=M_{k}\\}$,\nwhere $\\sigma_{k}$ is Pauli observable of given dimension. Pick results\ndetermined by our optimum Pauli measurement set, we run a maximum likelihood\nestimation to get a density matrix reconstruction. Our\nprotocol is tested over a range of different $\\eta$, and the\nresults are shown in Figure~\\ref{Fig1}. We can see that for small noise $\\eta$,\nthe simulated state is very close to pure, and the protocol returns a\nhigh-fidelity density matrix reconstruction. As noise $\\eta$\nincreases, the pure state assumption becomes less useful, and our protocol yields\na low fidelity estimation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{ThreeQubitPauliSimulation}\n\n\\caption{The average fidelity of reconstructed density matrices compared to\nthe ideal state using an optimum Pauli measurement set for 3 qubits. The error bars\nare given by standard deviation of the said fidelity over 100 instances.

However,\nthe creation of a pure state in NMR requires unrealistic experimental conditions such as extremely low temperatures or high magnetic fields, which makes it impractical for a liquid sample. To overcome this problem, one can prepare a pseudo-pure state (PPS) alternatively\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\rho_{\\text{PPS}}=\\frac{1-\\epsilon}{2^N}{\\mathbb{I}}+\\epsilon|\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|,\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\rho_{\\text{PPS}}=\\frac{1-\\epsilon}{2^{N}}{\\mathbb{I}}+\\epsilon|%&#10;\\phi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|,\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mtext>PPS</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03f5</mi></mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>N</mi></msup></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\ud835\udd40</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03f5</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05379.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\nu_i$  is the resonance frequency of spin $i$ and $J_{ij}$ are the scalar coupling constants between spins $i$ and $j$.

Since our protocol\nis designed for pure-state tomography, the performance of our protocol is expected\nto drop along with the decrease of purity in a quantum state.\n\nIn order to further demonstrate the advantages of our protocol, we\ncompare it to a quantum state tomography with\nPauli measurements. Using the same number of random Pauli measurements,\none could also perform the maximum likelihood method to get a reconstruction\nof the density matrix. Note that the optimum set of $11$ Pauli measurements may\nbe randomly hit in this case, which means the best performance\nof random Pauli measurement algorithm is the same compared with\nour protocol. However, in a realistic setting, only one set of\nrandom Pauli measurements will be chosen. To show the advantage of our protocol, we only have to outperform the\naverage case of this random algorithm.\n\nWe randomly generated $11$ distinct 2-qubit Pauli measurements (including identity),\nand used the maximum likelihood method to get an estimate of our density matrix.\nIf the density matrix given by this set of measurements is not unique,\nthe maximum likelihood method runs multiple times to get an average\nestimation. For each experiment, 100 sets of random Pauli measurements\nwere chosen. The result is shown in Fig. \\ref{NMRfig2}. We can see\nthat for high purity, our method significantly outperforms the random\nPauli algorithm. The advantage decreases as purity decreases, which indicates\nour method is more efficient for a state that is close to pure.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{2qubittomoreal}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{2qubittomoim}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{2qubitreconreal}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{2qubitreconim}\n\n\\caption{The reconstruction of density matrix for state number one.

Here, we measured all $64$ Pauli measurements, and only use $31$ of\nthem described in Eq. \\ref{pauli3} for our protocol.\nAs shown in Fig. \\ref{NMRfig3}, only using less than half of the desired measurements, we reconstructed density matrices for the GHZ state with 0.96 fidelity. We then compare it to a quantum state tomography algorithm implementing $31$ random Pauli measurements (including identity). Since the number of unused Pauli measurements\nare much more compared to the 2-qubit case, we are less likely to\nhit the optimum set in this random algorithm. By implementing a similar\nmaximum likelihood reconstruction, we found the average fidelity of\nthis random algorithm to be 0.87 with standard deviation of 0.16.\nThe detailed result is shown in Fig. \\ref{NMRfig4}, which shows clearly that our\nprotocol has a decent advantage over the average case in the randomized\nalgorithm.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{3qubittomoreal}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{3qubittomoim}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{3qubitreconreal}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{3qubitreconim}\n\n\\caption{The reconstruction of density matrix for GHZ state.

Quarter- and half-waveplates in each photon's path are rotated to choose a separable polarization basis. We call the set of angles specifying each waveplate's position the \\emph{setting} of the measurement. The $n$-photon state is projected onto the basis set by the waveplate angles with $n$ polarizing beamsplitters. A single-photon detector is present in each of the $2n$ output ports of the beamsplitters, and $n$-fold coincident detections among the $n$ paths are counted. There are $2^n$ combinations of $n$-fold coincident detection events that correspond to a state with one photon entering each of the $n$ beamsplitters before being detected in one of the two output ports. Summing the total number of $n$-fold coincidences over these $2^n$ combinations gives the total number of copies of the state detected by the measurement.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics{optics2outcometomo.pdf}\n\\caption{Measurement scheme for a polarization-encoded $n$-photon state. The $n$-qubit state is encoded in the polarizations of the $n$ photons. Each photon is measured using a quarter-waveplate (QWP), half-waveplate (HWP) and a polarizing beamplitter (PBS) with a single-photon counting detector (SPD) at each of its output ports. The quarter- and half-waveplates are rotated to choose the measurement basis for each photon. Separable projective measurements are performed by counting coincident detection events between all $n$ photons.} \\label{opticsmeas}\n\\end{figure}\n\nA minimum of $3^n$ measurement settings are required for general state tomography using separable projective measurements~\\cite{deBurgh05}. We note that, if one performs nonseparable measurements, then general state tomography can be performed with $2^n+1$ measurement settings~\\cite{adamson10}. However, these types of measurements are difficult to perform in practice, so we restrict the discussion here to separable ones.\n\nOne can think of each setting as a projective measurement that produces results for multiple Pauli operators simultaneously. For example, consider measuring a 2-photon state with the waveplates set such that a photon in the positive eigenstate of the Pauli $X$ or $Y$ operator will be deterministically transmitted at the first or second beamsplitter, respectively. For simplicity we will call this the $XY$ setting. There are four relevant two-fold coincident detection events, which we denote $N_{tt}$, $N_{tr}$, $N_{rt}$, and $N_{rr}$, and where the first and second subscripts represent which output port (i.e. transmitted or reflected) the first or second photon was detected, respectively. These counts can be summed in specific ways to find expectation values of different Pauli operators. For example the expectation value of $\\langle XY\\rangle$ is given by $\\langle XY\\rangle=(N_{tt}-N_{tr}-N_{rt}+N_{rr})/N$, where the total number of copies $N$ is given by $N = N_{tt}+N_{tr}+N_{rt}+N_{rr}$. Similarly, $\\langle XI \\rangle$ can be found with $\\langle XI\\rangle=(N_{tt}+N_{tr}-N_{rt}-N_{rr})/N$. In total, the $XY$ setting measures the following four Pauli operators:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nXY,XI,IY,II.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\n\nBased on this observation, we can use the results of Theorem~\\ref{th:2qubits} and Theorem~\\ref{th:3qubits} to reduce the number of settings to UDA pure states. For the two-qubit case, recall that the $11$ Pauli operators to UDA any pure states are\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nA=\\{II,IX,IY,IZ,XI,YX,YY,YZ,ZX,ZY,ZZ\\}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nNotice that any of the $6$ Paulis with no $I$ component (the two-qubit correlations) only appear in the setting which measures it. However, looking at the remaining $5$ Paulis, $II$ is included in every setting, $IX$ is included in the $YX$ setting, $IY$ in $YY$, $IZ$ in $YZ$. The only operator which does not appear in the settings of the two-qubit correlations is $XI$, so for the two qubit case, $6+1=7$ settings are required to be sufficient for UDA.\n\nAnd similar analysis can be done for the three qubit case, with the aid of computer search.\nWe summarize these results as the corollary below.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\n\\label{cor}\nOnly $7$ settings\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\{XI,YX,YY,YZ,ZX,ZY,ZZ\\}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nare needed to UDA any two-qubit pure states,\ncompared with $9$ settings needed for general two-qubit state tomography.\nAnd only $19$ settings\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\{XXZ, XYZ, XZX, XZY, XZZ, YXX, \\nonumber\\\\YXY, YYX, YYY,\nYZX, YZY, YZZ, \\nonumber\\\\ ZXX, ZXY, ZXZ, ZYX, ZYY, ZYZ, ZZX\\}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nare needed to UDA any three-qubit pure states,\ncompared with $27$ settings needed for general three-qubit state tomography.\n\\end{corollary}\n\nWe remark that Corollary $1$ is a direct application of Theorem~\\ref{th:2qubits} and Theorem~\\ref{th:3qubits}. It is possible for even better results to be obtained by including knowledge of settings in the first optimization. However, proving sufficiency becomes more difficult in these cases.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nIn this work, we find the most compact Pauli measurement sets for\npure-state tomography on two- and three-qubit systems. The experiments on\ntwo-qubit and three-qubit NMR systems demonstrated the advantages of using\nsuch protocol. We reduced the required number of measurements by $5$ and $33$ for\ntwo- and three-qubit systems, respectively, without significant drop in fidelity.\nAs a direct application of this result,\nwe also showed that our scheme can be used to reduce\nthe number of settings needed for pure-state tomography in quantum optics systems.\n\nA few questions need to be answered before we scale the test to larger\nsystems. We are able to find the optimum sets for two and three qubits.\nHowever, the method we used to find those sets can not be easily generalized\nto larger systems. It remains open whether one can find a general algorithm to\ndecide the smallest sets of Pauli operators to UDA any pure state for\na system of $n$ qubits. If such an algorithm exists, we would hope that\nthe number of measurements required\ngrows linearly with the Hilbert space dimension of the system.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement} \nWe thank Nengkun Yu for helpful discussions. \n\nThis research was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Canada Research Chairs, Industry Canada, National Key Basic Research Program (2013CB921800 and 2014CB848700), the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (NO. 11425523) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 11375167). \n\n\\bibliography{Pauli}\n\n\n\n\\appendix\n\\label{appendix}\n\\section{Proof of Theorem~\\ref{th:3qubits}}\n\nIn order to prove Theorem~\\ref{th:3qubits}, it suffices to prove\nthe following result.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nAny Hermitian operator perpendicular to\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&&\\{IIX,IIY,IIZ,IXI,IXX,IXY,IYI,IYX,IYY, IZI,\\nonumber \\\\\n&&XIZ,XXX,XXY,XYX,XYY,XZX,XZY,YXX,\\nonumber \\\\\n&&YXY,YXZ,YYX,YYY,YYZ,YZI,ZII,ZXZ,ZYZ,\\nonumber \\\\\n&&ZZX,ZZY,ZZZ\\}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nmust have at least two positive and two negative eigenvalues.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThe proof proceeds as follows. First construct an $8$-by-$8$ traceless Hermitian matrix $H$ which is perpendicular to all the above Pauli operators. This will be a real linear combination of every Pauli operator that is not being measured. This $H$ is then a general description of any Hermitian matrix in the complement of the span of all measured operators. We will show through a case by case analysis that if we assume $H$ only has one positive eigenvalue, then it follows that $H$ must be the zero matrix. A similar argument holds for having only one negative eigenvalue therefore $H$ must have at least two positive and two negative eigenvalues.\n\nLet us begin by constructing $H$ which is a real linear combination of the 33 Pauli operators not being measured (excluding the identity). $H$ is then:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nH&=&x_{1} IXZ + x_2 IYZ + x_3 IZX + x_4 IZY \\\\\n&&+ x_5 IZZ + x_6 XII + x_7 XIX + x_8 XIY\\\\\n&&+ x_9 XXI + x_{10} XXZ + x_{11} XYI + x_{12} XYZ \\\\\n&&+ x_{13} XZI + x_{14} XZZ + x_{15} YII + x_{16} YIX\\\\\n&& + x_{17} YIY + x_{18} YIZ + x_{19} YXI + x_{20} YYI \\\\\n&&+ x_{21} YZX + x_{22} YZY + x_{23} YZZ + x_{24} ZIX \\\\\n&&+ x_{25} ZIY + x_{26} ZIZ + x_{27} ZXI + x_{28} ZXX \\\\\n&&+ x_{29} ZXY + x_{30} ZYI + x_{31} ZYX + x_{32} ZYY\\\\\n&& + x_{33} ZZI.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\nWriting $H$ in matrix form will give the form:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_{11} & c_{12}& c_{13}& c_{14}&c_{15} &c_{16} &c_{17} & 0 \\\\\nc_{12}^{\\ast} & c_{22} & c_{23} & c_{24}& c_{25}& c_{26}&0 &c_{28}  \\\\\nc_{13}^{\\ast} & c_{23}^{\\ast} & c_{33}& c_{34}& c_{35}& 0& c_{37} & c_{38}  \\\\\nc_{14}^{\\ast} & c_{24}^{\\ast} & c_{34}^{\\ast}& c_{44}&0 & c_{46}& c_{47}& c_{48} \\\\\nc_{15}^{\\ast} & c_{25}^{\\ast} & c_{35}^{\\ast}& 0 & c_{55}& c_{56}& c_{57}& c_{58}  \\\\\nc_{16}^{\\ast} & c_{26}^{\\ast} &0 & c_{46}^{\\ast}& c_{56}^{\\ast}& c_{66}& c_{67}& c_{68}  \\\\\nc_{17}^{\\ast} & 0 & c_{37}^{\\ast}& c_{47}^{\\ast}& c_{57}^{\\ast}& c_{67}^{\\ast}&c_{77} & c_{78} \\\\\n0 & c_{28}^{\\ast} &c_{38}^{\\ast} & c_{48}^{\\ast}& c_{58}^{\\ast}& c_{68}^{\\ast}&c_{78}^{\\ast} &c_{88}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nc_{11}&=& x_{5}+x_{26} + x_{33} ;\\\\\nc_{22}&=& -x_5-x_{26} + x_{33};\\\\\nc_{33}&=& -x_5+x_{26} - x_{33};\\\\\nc_{44}&=&x_5-x_{26} - x_{33} ;\\\\\nc_{55}&=&x_5-x_{26} - x_{33}=c_{44};\\\\\nc_{66}&=& -x_5+x_{26} - x_{33}=c_{33};\\\\\nc_{77}&=& -x_5-x_{26} + x_{33}=c_{22};\\\\\nc_{88}&=& x_{5}+x_{26} + x_{33}=c_{11};\\\\\nc_{12}&=& x_3+x_{24} - i(x_4+ x_{25});\\\\\nc_{34}&=&-x_3+x_{24}+i(x_4-x_{25});\\\\\nc_{56}&=&x_3-x_{24}-i(x_4-x_{25})=-c_{34};\\\\\nc_{78}&=&-x_3-x_{24}+i(x_4+x_{25})=-c_{12};\\\\\nc_{13}&=&x_1+x_{27} - i(x_2+ x_{30});\\\\\nc_{24}&=&-x_1 +x_{27}+ i(x_2-x_{30});\\\\\nc_{57}&=&x_1-x_{27}-i(x_2-x_{30})=-c_{24};\\\\\nc_{68}&=&-x_1-x_{27}+i(x_2+x_{30})=-c_{13};\\\\\nc_{14}&=&x_{28}-x_{32} - i( x_{29}+x_{31});\\\\\nc_{23}&=&x_{28}+x_{32} +i(x_{29}-x_{31});\\\\\nc_{58}&=&-x_{28}+x_{32}+i(x_{29}+x_{31})=-c_{14};\\\\\nc_{67}&=&-x_{28}-x_{32}-i(x_{29}-x_{31})=-c_{23};\\\\\nc_{15}&=&x_6+x_{13} + x_{14} - i( x_{15} + x_{18} + x_{23});  \\\\\nc_{26}&=&x_6+x_{13}-x_{14}-i(x_{15}-x_{18}-x_{23});\\\\\nc_{37}&=&x_6-x_{13}-x_{14}-i(x_{15}+x_{18}-x_{23});\\\\\nc_{48}&=&x_6-x_{13}+x_{14}-i(x_{15}-x_{18}+x_{23})\\\\\n&&=c_{15}-c_{26}^{\\ast}+c_{37}^{\\ast};\\\\\nc_{16}&=&x_7- x_{17}  - x_{22}  - i( x_8+  x_{16}+x_{21}) ;\\\\\nc_{25}&=&x_7+x_{17}+x_{22}+i(x_8-x_{16}-x_{21});\\\\\nc_{38}&=&x_7-x_{17}+x_{22}-i(x_8+x_{16}-x_{21});\\\\\nc_{47}&=&x_7+x_{17}-x_{22}+i(x_8-x_{16}+x_{21})\\\\\n&&=c_{16}^{\\ast}+c_{25}-c_{38}^{\\ast};\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nc_{17}&=& x_9+x_{10} - x_{20}-i( x_{11}+ x_{12}+ x_{19});\\\\\nc_{28}&=&x_9-x_{10}-x_{20}-i(x_{11}-x_{12}+x_{19});\\\\\nc_{35}&=&x_9+x_{10}+x_{20}+i(x_{11}+x_{12}-x_{19});\\\\\nc_{46}&=&x_9-x_{10}+x_{20}+i(x_{11}-x_{12}-x_{19})\\\\\n&&=c_{28}^{\\ast}+c_{35}-c_{17}^{\\ast};\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nNote that the main anti-diagonal is all zeros. This was by design, since any set of Pauli operators Clifford equivalent to the result from the hyper-graph dualization program is also a solution, we had the freedom to choose a set which would make the proof simpler. Choosing the set of operators which contained all Pauli operators constructed by tensoring only $X$ operators and $Y$ operators meant $H$ would have zero main anti-diagonal. The only reason for choosing this set is it makes this proof a little simpler.\n\nHere we assume $H$ is a Hermitian matrix with only one positive eigenvalue. We first show all diagonal entries of $H$ must be zero. Observe that $c_{55}=c_{44}$, $c_{66}=c_{33}$, $c_{77}=c_{22}$, $c_{88}=c_{11}$. In order for the traceless condition on $H$ to hold, it is then clear that $c_{11}+c_{22}+c_{33}+c_{44}=0$. If $H$ has some nonzero diagonal entry, then at least one of $c_{11}, c_{22}, c_{33}$ and $c_{44}$ will be positive. Without loss of generality, let $c_{11}>0$, then the submatrix of $H$ formed by the rows $(1, 8)$ and columns $(1,8)$, which will be of the form $c_{11}*I$, will have two positive eigenvalues.\n\\begin{lemma}\nCauchy's Interlacing Theorem states\\cite{horn2012matrix}:\\\\\nLet:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nA=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nB & C\\\\\nC^\\dagger & D\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nbe an n-by-n Hermitian matrix, where $B$ has size m-by-m (m$<$n). If the eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$ are $\\alpha_1\\leq \\ldots \\leq \\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_1 \\leq \\ldots \\leq \\beta_m$ respectfully. Then:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\alpha_k \\leq \\beta_k \\leq \\alpha_{k+n-m}, k=1,\\ldots ,m.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\\end{lemma}\nIt follows from Cauchy's interlacing property that if a principle submatrix of $H$ has 2 positive eigenvalues then $H$ also has at least two positive eigenvalues.\n\nHence,  $H$ must be in the following form:\n\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:form}\n\\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{$\nH=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & c_{12}& c_{13}& c_{14}&c_{15} &c_{16} &c_{17} & 0 \\\\\nc_{12}^{\\ast} & 0 & c_{23} & c_{24}& c_{25}& c_{26}&0 &c_{28}  \\\\\nc_{13}^{\\ast} & c_{23}^{\\ast} & 0& c_{34}& c_{35}& 0& c_{37} & c_{38}  \\\\\nc_{14}^{\\ast} & c_{24}^{\\ast} & c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0&0 & c_{28}^{\\ast}+c_{35}-c_{17}^{\\ast}& c_{16}^{\\ast}+c_{25}-c_{38}^{\\ast}& c_{15}-c_{26}^{\\ast}+c_{37}^{\\ast} \\\\\nc_{15}^{\\ast} & c_{25}^{\\ast} & c_{35}^{\\ast}& 0 & 0& -c_{34}& -c_{24}& -c_{14}  \\\\\nc_{16}^{\\ast} & c_{26}^{\\ast} &0 &c_{28}+c_{35}^{\\ast}-c_{17}& -c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0& -c_{23}& -c_{13}  \\\\\nc_{17}^{\\ast} & 0 & c_{37}^{\\ast}& c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}-c_{38}& -c_{24}^{\\ast}& -c_{23}^{\\ast}&0 & -c_{12} \\\\\n0 & c_{28}^{\\ast} &c_{38}^{\\ast} & c_{15}^{\\ast}-c_{26}+c_{37}& -c_{14}^{\\ast}& -c_{13}^{\\ast}&-c_{12}^{\\ast} &0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$}\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\nIn fact, under the assumption that $H$ has only $1$ positive eigenvalue, it follows from Cauchy's interlacing theorem that any principle submatrix of $H$ cannot have more than one positive eigenvalue. Otherwise, we will have a contradiction.\n\nLet us look at the submatrix formed by rows $1,2,4,5$ and the same columns. It is a traceless Hermitian matrix with determinant $\\vert c_{14}c_{25}-c_{15}c_{24}\\vert^2$. Again, if the submatrix has positive determinant, then it must have exactly two positive eigenvalues. Once again by applying Cauchy's interlacing property, $H$ will have at least two positive eigenvalues. This immediately contradictions our assumption. The above argument  implies that, under our assumption $H$ has only $1$ positive eigenvalue, we have $\\vert c_{14}c_{25}-c_{15}c_{24}\\vert^2\\leq 0$. It is not surprising that the inequality holds if and only if the equality holds. Then we have $c_{14}c_{25}-c_{15}c_{24}=0$.\n\nSimilarly, by considering other $4$-by-$4$ submatrices constructed from the rows and columns $a,b,4,5$ where $a,b$ are any two of the remain six rows, we can show that:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nc_{14}c_{35}-c_{15}c_{34}&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{14}c_{34}^{\\ast}-c_{15}(c_{28}+c_{35}^{\\ast}-c_{17})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{14}c_{24}^{\\ast}-c_{15}(c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}-c_{38})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{14}c_{14}^{\\ast}-c_{15}(c_{15}^{\\ast}-c_{26}+c_{37})&=&0;\\\\\nc_{24}c_{35}-c_{25}c_{34}&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{24}c_{34}^{\\ast}-c_{25}(c_{28}+c_{35}^{\\ast}-c_{17})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{24}c_{24}^{\\ast}-c_{25}(c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}-c_{38})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{24}c_{14}^{\\ast}-c_{25}(c_{15}^{\\ast}-c_{26}+c_{37})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{34}c_{34}^{\\ast}-c_{35}(c_{28}+c_{35}^{\\ast}-c_{17})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{34}c_{24}^{\\ast}-c_{35}(c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}-c_{38})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{34}c_{14}^{\\ast}-c_{35}(c_{15}^{\\ast}-c_{26}+c_{37})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{24}^{\\ast}(c_{28}+c_{35}^{\\ast}-c_{17})+c_{34}^{\\ast}(c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}-c_{38})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{14}^{\\ast}(c_{28}+c_{35}^{\\ast}-c_{17})+c_{34}^{\\ast}(c_{15}^{\\ast}-c_{26}+c_{37})&=&0;\\\\\n-c_{14}^{\\ast}(c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}-c_{38})+c_{24}^{\\ast}(c_{15}^{\\ast}-c_{26}+c_{37})&=&0.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nThe above equations will imply that the $8$-by-$2$ submatrix formed by the $4$-th and $5$-th columns has rank at most $1$.\n\nThe same argument can be used to prove that the $8$-by-$2$ submatrices formed by columns $(1,8)$, $(2,7)$ or $(3,6)$ also have rank at most $1$.\n\nAs a straightforward consequence, $H$ has rank no more than $4$.\n\nIn other words, the $k$-th column and the $(9-k)$-th column are linearly dependant. This means that there exist $\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,\\lambda_4$ such that the following equations hold:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:lambda}\n&\\lambda_1\\overrightarrow{C_1}+(1-\\lambda_1)\\overrightarrow{C_8}=\\lambda_2\\overrightarrow{C_2}+(1-\\lambda_2)\\overrightarrow{C_7}=0\\\\\n&\\lambda_3\\overrightarrow{C_3}+(1-\\lambda_3)\\overrightarrow{C_6}=\\lambda_4\\overrightarrow{C_4}+(1-\\lambda_4)\\overrightarrow{C_5}=0\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere we have used $\\overrightarrow{C_k}$ to represent the $k$-th column of the matrix (\\ref{eq:form}).\n\nLet us start with a special case.\nLet $\\lambda_1=0$. Then $c_{12}=c_{13}=c_{14}=c_{28}=c_{38}=0$ and $c_{15}=c_{26}^{\\ast}-c_{37}^{\\ast}$. $H$ can be simplified as the following:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{$\nH=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0& 0& 0&c_{26}^{\\ast}-c_{37}^{\\ast} &c_{16} &c_{17} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & c_{23} & c_{24}& c_{25}& c_{26}&0 &0  \\\\\n0 & c_{23}^{\\ast} & 0& c_{34}& c_{35}& 0& c_{37} & 0  \\\\\n0 & c_{24}^{\\ast} & c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0&0 & c_{35}-c_{17}^{\\ast}& c_{16}^{\\ast}+c_{25}& 0 \\\\\nc_{26}-c_{37} & c_{25}^{\\ast} & c_{35}^{\\ast}& 0 & 0& -c_{34}& -c_{24}&0  \\\\\nc_{16}^{\\ast} & c_{26}^{\\ast} &0 &c_{35}^{\\ast}-c_{17}& -c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0& -c_{23}& 0  \\\\\nc_{17}^{\\ast} & 0 & c_{37}^{\\ast}& c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}& -c_{24}^{\\ast}& -c_{23}^{\\ast}&0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 &0 & 0&0& 0&0 &0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n$}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\n\nIf we set $c_{23}=c_{24}=c_{34}=0$, then the top-left $4$-by-$4$ submatrix is zero. In this case, the characteristic polynomial of $H$ contains only even powers. Thus $H$ has only one positive eigenvalue implies $H$ has only one negative eigenvalue too. As a consequence, the top-right $4$-by-$4$ submatrix of $H$ has rank exactly $1$.\n\nAs a result, any $2$-by-$2$ submatrix of the top-right submatrix must have determinant zero. From suitable choices of submatrices we can obtain the following equations:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nc_{26}c_{37} & =&0;\\\\\nc_{26}(c_{26}^{\\ast}-c_{37}^{\\ast})& =&c_{16}c_{25};\\\\\nc_{37}(c_{26}^{\\ast}-c_{37}^{\\ast})& =&c_{17}c_{35};\\\\\nc_{16}(c_{16}^{\\ast}+c_{25})+c_{17}(c_{17}^{\\ast}-c_{35}) & =&0.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n Using the above equations we can obtain:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n0&=&c_{16}(c_{16}^{\\ast}+c_{25})+c_{17}(c_{17}^{\\ast}-c_{35})\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&c_{16}c_{25}-c_{17}c_{35}+\\vert c_{17}\\vert^2+\\vert c_{16}\\vert^2\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&c_{26}(c_{26}^{\\ast}-c_{37}^{\\ast})-c_{37}(c_{26}^{\\ast}-c_{37}^{\\ast})+\\vert c_{17}\\vert^2+\\vert c_{16}\\vert^2\\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\\vert c_{26}-c_{37}\\vert^2+\\vert c_{17}\\vert^2+\\vert c_{16}\\vert^2\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis implies $c_{16}=c_{17}=0$ and $c_{26}=c_{37}$. Also since $c_{26}c_{37}=0$ we know that $c_{26}=c_{37}=0$. Furthermore $c_{25}(c_{16}^{\\ast}+c_{25})=0$ and $c_{35}(c_{35}-c_{17}^{\\ast})=0$ will guarantee $c_{25}=c_{35}=0$. Therefore $H$ is once again the zero matrix.\n\nWe must then assume at least one of $c_{23}, c_{24}, c_{34}$ must be nonzero. If $c_{23}\\neq 0$, then by considering submatrices formed by rows/columns $(1,2,3,k)$ $(5\\leq k\\leq 8)$, we have $c_{16}=c_{17}=0$ and $c_{26}=c_{37}$. For the case that $c_{24}=0$ or $c_{34}=0$, we will also have $c_{16}=c_{17}=0$ and $c_{26}=c_{37}$ by considering appropriately chosen submatrices.\n\nWe are then left with $H$ in the form:\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\resizebox{0.8\\linewidth}{!}{$\nH=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0& 0& 0& 0 &0 &0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & c_{23} & c_{24}& c_{25}& c_{26}&0 &0  \\\\\n0 & c_{23}^{\\ast} & 0& c_{34}& c_{35}& 0& c_{26} & 0  \\\\\n0 & c_{24}^{\\ast} & c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0&0 & c_{35}& c_{25}& 0 \\\\\n0 & c_{25}^{\\ast} & c_{35}^{\\ast}& 0 & 0& -c_{34}& -c_{24}&0  \\\\\n0 & c_{26}^{\\ast} &0 &c_{35}^{\\ast}& -c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0& -c_{23}& 0  \\\\\n0 & 0 & c_{26}^{\\ast}& c_{25}^{\\ast}& -c_{24}^{\\ast}& -c_{23}^{\\ast}&0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 &0 & 0&0& 0&0 &0\n\\end{bmatrix}.$}\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nNow, recall the fact that the submatrices formed by the $k$-th and the $(9-k)$-th columns will always have rank $1$. From this it can be shown we will have $H$ is a zero matrix.\n\nTake the submatrix formed by the second and seventh columns for example. Since they are linearly dependant, the determinant of any $2$-by-$2$ submatrix must be zero. From this we can get that $\\vert c_{23}\\vert^2+\\vert c_{26}\\vert^2=0$. Therefore $c_{23}=c_{26}=0$. By similar arguments on various submatrices, $H$ can be shown to be the zero matrix.\n\nThus, under our assumption that $H$ has exactly one positive eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1\\neq 0$. Similarly, we can also prove that $\\lambda_1\\neq 1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3, \\lambda_4 \\neq 0, 1$. We can then assume from now on that $H$ has no zero columns or rows.\n\nHence, there exists certain $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$ and $\\lambda_4 \\neq 0,1$ which satisfies equation \\ref{eq:lambda}.\n\nLet us use $\\Re $ and $\\Im$ to denote the real part and imaginary part of a complex number. Then the above equations can be rewritten as linear equations of real numbers.\n\nLet us use $M(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,\\lambda_4)$ to denote the $48$-by-$30$ coefficient matrix. If we can prove that the coefficient matrix always has rank $30$ for any $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$ and $\\lambda_4$, then it will imply that all $c_{ij}$'s are zeros which will  immediately contradict our assumption.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not that lucky. $M(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,\\lambda_4)$ will be degenerate under certain assignment of variables $(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,\\lambda_4)$. For example, $rank(M(\\frac{1+i}{2},\\frac{1+i}{2},\\frac{1+i}{2},\\frac{1+i}{2}))=27<30$. However, we can still show that $M(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\lambda_3,\\lambda_4)$ will have rank $30$ except for some degenerate cases which will be dealt with separately .\nThe top-left $2$-by-$2$ submatrix has rank $2$ if and only if $\\lambda_1\\neq 0$\n\nAt least one of the following situations must happen:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item [1.] $\\begin{bmatrix}-C_1 & A_1\\\\ B_2 & C_2\\end{bmatrix}$ has full rank. This implies $c_{12}=c_{17}=0$.\n\\item [2.] $\\begin{bmatrix} A_1 & C_1\\\\-D_2 & A_2\\end{bmatrix}$ has full rank.

Under our assumption that there is no row of $H$ containg only zero entries, we have $c_{28}=0$.\n\nRecall that the $4$-th and $5$-th rows are linearly dependent, thus $c_{34}(-c_{34}^{\\ast})=c_{35}(c_{28}+c_{35}^{\\ast})$ which now can be simplified as $\\vert c_{34}\\vert^2+\\vert c_{35}\\vert^2=0$. Hence $c_{34}=c_{35}=0$.

So, here we assume the submatrix formed by rows $(1,2,7,8)$ and columns $(3,4,5,6)$ does not contain any zero element.\n\nThen $\\frac{c_{15}}{c_{25}}=\\frac{c_{13}}{c_{23}}=\\frac{c_{38}}{c_{37}}$ which implies $c_{38}c_{25}=c_{37}c_{15}$.\n\nFollows from the rank $1$ condition, we have\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nc_{15}(c_{15}^{\\ast}-c_{26}+c_{37})&=&-\\vert c_{14}\\vert^2,\\\\\nc_{25}(c_{16}+c_{25}^{\\ast}-c_{38})&=&-\\vert c_{24}\\vert^2.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nBy substituting $c_{38}c_{25}=c_{37}c_{15}$ and $c_{15}c_{26}=c_{25}c_{16}$ into the above two equations, we have\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\vert c_{15}\\vert^2+\\vert c_{14}\\vert^2 &=& c_{15}c_{26}-c_{15}c_{37}\\\\\n&=& c_{25}c_{16}-c_{25}c_{38}\\\\\n&=& -\\vert c_{24}\\vert^2-\\vert c_{25}\\vert^2\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhich implies $c_{15}=c_{14}=c_{24}=c_{25}=0$. However, it contradicts our assumption that there is no zero element in the submatrix formed by $(1,2,7,8)$ rows and $(3,4,5,6)$ columns.\n\nSimilarly, we can also prove that there is no Hermtian matrix in the form ~\\ref{eq:form} with only one positive eigenvalue if any of the following conditions apply.\n\\item [2.] $c_{12}=c_{28}=0$.\n\\item [3.] $c_{13}=c_{16}=0$.\n\\item [4.] $c_{13}=c_{38}=0$.\n\\item [5.] $c_{14}=c_{15}=0$.\n\\item [6.] $c_{23}=c_{26}=0$.\n\\item [7.] $c_{23}=c_{37}=0$.\n\\item [8.] $c_{24}=c_{25}=0$.\n\\item [9.] $c_{34}=c_{35}=0$.\n\nNow, the only case we left is the following:\n\\item [10.]  $\\Re \\lambda_1=\\Re \\lambda_2=\\Re \\lambda_3=\\Re \\lambda_4=\\frac{1}{2}$. In this case, $rank(\\begin{bmatrix}-C_1 & A_1\\\\ B_2 & C_2\\end{bmatrix})=3$. Hence $(\\Re c_{12}, \\Im c_{12}, \\Re c_{17}, \\Im c_{17})$ lies in the nullspace of $\\begin{bmatrix}-C_1 & A_1\\\\ B_2 & C_2\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\frac{1}{2} & -b_1 & \\frac{1}{2} & b_1\\\\\nb_1 & -\\frac{1}{2} & b_1 & -\\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & -b_2 & \\frac{1}{2} & b_2 \\\\\nb_2 & \\frac{1}{2} & -b_2 & \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}$.

Hence the only remaining case is $c_{26}=c_{15}^{\\ast}, c_{16}=-c_{25}^{\\ast}, c_{17}=c_{35}^{\\ast}$. Thus\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nH=\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & c_{12}& c_{13}& c_{14}&c_{15} &-c_{25}^{\\ast} &c_{35}^{\\ast} & 0 \\\\\nc_{12}^{\\ast} & 0 & c_{23} & c_{24}& c_{25}& c_{15}^{\\ast}&0 & -c_{35}^{\\ast}  \\\\\nc_{13}^{\\ast} & c_{23}^{\\ast} & 0& c_{34}& c_{35}& 0& -c_{15}^{\\ast} & c_{25}^{\\ast}  \\\\\nc_{14}^{\\ast} & c_{24}^{\\ast} & c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0&0 & -c_{35}& -c_{25}& -c_{15} \\\\\nc_{15}^{\\ast} & c_{25}^{\\ast} & c_{35}^{\\ast}& 0 & 0& -c_{34}& -c_{24}& -c_{14}  \\\\\n-c_{25} & c_{15} &0 & -c_{35}^{\\ast}& -c_{34}^{\\ast}& 0& -c_{23}& -c_{13}  \\\\\nc_{35} & 0 & -c_{15}& -c_{25}^{\\ast}& -c_{24}^{\\ast}& -c_{23}^{\\ast}&0 & -c_{12} \\\\\n0 & -c_{35} & c_{25} & -c_{15}^{\\ast}& -c_{14}^{\\ast}& -c_{13}^{\\ast}&-c_{12}^{\\ast} &0\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nAccording to $c_{26}=c_{15}^{\\ast}$, we have $2(b_2+b_3)(1-4 b_1b_4)=(4b_2b_3-1) (2b_1+2b_4)$ which implies $4(b_1b_2b_3+b_1b_2b_4+b_1b_3b_4+b_2b_3b_4)=b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4$.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item [1.] $4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3=1$. Thus $b_1+b_2+b_3=4b_1b_2b_3$. However, one can easy to verify that there do not exist three real numbers $b_1,b_2,b_3$ satisfying these two equations.\n\\item [2.] { $4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3\\neq 1$. Hence $b_4=\\frac{b_1+b_2+b_3-4b_1b_2b_3}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}$. By substituting the assignment of $b_4$ into Equation~\\ref{eq:ratio}, we have\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nc_{14}&=&p \\cdot \\bigg( \\frac{2(1-4b_1^2)(b_2+b_3)+4b_1(1-4b_2b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{-8b_1(b_2+b_3)+(1-4b_1^2)(1-4b_2b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{15}&=&p \\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{2(1+4b_1^2)(b_2+b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{(1+4b_1^2)(1-4b_2b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{23}&=&p \\cdot \\bigg(\\frac{2(1+4b_1^2)(b_3-b_2)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{(1+4b_1^2)(1+4b_2b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{24}&=& q \\cdot \\bigg(\\frac{2(1-4b_2^2)(b_1+b_3)+4b_2(1-4b_1b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{8b_2(b_1+b_3)-(1-4b_2^2)(1-4b_1b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{25}&=& q \\cdot \\bigg(\\frac{2(1+4b_2^2)(b_1+b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{(1+4b_2^2)(1-4b_1b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{13}&=& q \\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{2(1+4b_2^2)(b_1-b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&-\\frac{(1+4b_2^2)(1+4b_1b_3)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{34}&=&r \\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{2(1-4b_3^2)(b_1+b_2)+4b_3(1-4b_1b_2)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{8b_3(b_1+b_2)-(1-4b_3^2)(1-4b_1b_2)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{35}&=&r \\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{2(1+4b_3^2)(b_1+b_2)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{(1+4b_3^2)(1-4b_1b_2)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg);\\\\\nc_{12}&=&r \\cdot\\bigg(\\frac{2(1+4b_3^2)(b_2-b_1)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\\\\n&&+\\frac{(1+4b_3^2)(1+4b_1b_2)}{4b_1b_2+4b_1b_3+4b_2b_3-1}\\emph{i}\\bigg).\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n\nAgain, with assistance of symbolic computation package like Mathematica, we can verify that the characteristic polynomial of $H$ contains only even powers. This implies $H$ has nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda$ if and only if it also has eigenvalue $-\\lambda$. Therefore, under our assumption that $H$ has only $1$ positive eigenvalue, $H$ also has only $1$ negative eigenvalue.\n\nHowever, let us consider the $3$-by-$3$ submatrix of $H$ formed by $(5,7,8)$-th rows and $(1,2,3)$-th columns . Its determinant is $(-\\emph{i} + 2 b_1) (\\emph{i}+ 2 b_1)^2 (1 + 2 \\emph{i} b_2) (\\emph{i} + 2 b_2)^2 (\\emph{i} - 2 b_3)^2 (\\emph{i} + 2 b_3)^2 r ((1 + 4 b_1^2) p^2 + (1 + 4 b_2^2) q^2 + (1 + 4 b_3^2) r^2)$. It is always nonzero unless $p=q=r$ or $r=0$. If $r=0$ this implies that $c_{12}=c_{34}=c_{35}=0$. This case has already been covered, Thus $H$ has rank at least $3$ which contradicts our previous conclusion that $H$ has only one positive eigenvalue and only one negative eigenvalue.}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nTo summarize, under our assumption that $H$ has only one positive eigenvalue, a contradiction always exist in every situation we studied. Hence, $H$ must has at least $2$ positive eigenvalues and at least $2$ negative eigenvalues. This completes our proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 24298, "prevtext": "\nBy ignoring the identity in $\\rho_{00}$, the system should evolve to a time-dependent pure state\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{align}\\label{pure2}\n{\\ensuremath{|{\\phi}\\rangle}}=\\alpha (t)|00\\rangle+\\beta (t) (|01\\rangle+|10\\rangle)/{\\sqrt{2}}+\\gamma(t)|11\\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle{|{\\phi}\\rangle}=\\alpha(t)|00\\rangle+\\beta(t)(|01\\rangle+|10%&#10;\\rangle)/{\\sqrt{2}}+\\gamma(t)|11\\rangle.\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mn>00</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mn>01</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mn>10</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>/</mo><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mn>11</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
