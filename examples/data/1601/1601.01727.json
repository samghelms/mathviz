Notable examples of this approach include the Fu-Kane superconductor \\cite{fu1}  that occurs in the interface of a 3D strong topological insulator (STI) and a conventional $s$-wave SC,\n the ``fractional'' quantum Hall effect that arises when STI is interfaced with a magnetic insulator \\cite{fu2,essin1,qi2}, as well as many interesting phenomena that occur when both SC and magnetic domains are present \\cite{akhmerov1,fu4}. Rich physics, including Majorana zero modes, also results when the edge of a 2D topological insulator is interfaced with magnets and superconductors \\cite{nilsson1,fu3,mi1}. More recently various exotic phases of quantum matter have been predicted to occur based on these same ingredients in strongly interacting systems \\cite{clarke1,lindner1,vaezi1,barkeshli1,wang1,metlitski1,bonderson1,chen1,mong1,milsted1,rahmani1}.\n\nIn this Letter we explore the physics of the interface between a Weyl semimetal and an $s$-wave superconductor. Surface states of a Weyl semimetal exhibit characteristic Fermi arcs that terminate at surface projections of the bulk Weyl nodes \\cite{wan1,vafek1}. Such ``open'' Fermi surfaces are fundamentally impossible in a purely 2D system and we thus expect the resulting SC state to also be anomalous. In this respect the situation is similar to the Fu-Kane superconductor \\cite{fu1} whose existence hinges on the odd number of Dirac fermions occurring on the surface of an STI. As we shall see there are several notable differences between STI/SC and Weyl/SC interfaces which make the latter a distinct and potentially more versatile platform for explorations of new phenomena.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width = 8.5cm]{fig1.pdf}\n\\caption{Surface Fermi arcs in a minimal model of a Weyl semimetal with (a) and without (b) time reversal symmetry ${\\cal T}$. Weyl nodes are represented by circles with positive (negative) chirality; green arrows indicate the possible direction of electron spin along the arcs. Panel (c) shows the $\\pi$ junction setup on the surface of a Weyl semimetal.\n}\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNondegenerate Weyl points can occur in crystals with broken time reversal symmetry ${\\cal T}$ or broken bulk inversion symmetry ${\\cal P}$. Recent experimental work reported convincing evidence for Weyl nodes and surface Fermi arcs in ${\\cal T}$-preserving noncentrosymmetric crystals in the TaAs family of semimetals \\cite{hasan1,lv1,yan1,lv2,yang1,hasan2}. We therefore focus our discussion on the SC proximity effect in this class of materials. When a crystal respects ${\\cal T}$ the minimum number of Weyl points ${\\cal N}$ is 4. This is because under ${\\cal T}$ a Weyl point at crystal momentum ${\\bm Q}$ maps onto a Weyl point at $-{\\bm Q}$ with the same chirality. Since the total chiral charge in the Brillouin zone must vanish there has to be another pair of ${\\cal T}$-conjugate Weyl nodes with an opposite chirality. We begin by discussing the SC proximity effect in this minimal case with ${\\cal N}=4$. We note that although the currently known Weyl semimetals exhibit larger number of nodes (${\\cal N}=24$ in the TaAs family) recent theoretical work identified materials that could realize instances with smaller ${\\cal N}$ \\cite{fang1,ruan1}, including the minimal case with ${\\cal N}=4$ predicted in MoTe$_2$ \\cite{bernevig1}.  The generic surface state of such a minimal ${\\cal T}$-preserving Weyl semimetal is depicted in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig1}a. \n\nInterfacing such a surface with a spin singlet $s$-wave SC one expects formation of a paired state from time-reversed Bloch electrons at crystal momenta ${\\bm k}$ and $-{\\bm k}$ along the arcs.

Presence of the $\\pi$ junctions (which we define parallel to the $y$ crystal axis) generates perfectly flat bands at zero energy between the projected Weyl nodes, Fig.\\ \\ref{fig2}d. We note that due to the periodic boundary conditions adopted in both $x$ and $y$ directions our numerics by necessity implement two parallel $\\pi$ junctions  which results in twice the number of flat bands compared to a single junction. We also find that, remarkably, the bands remain completely flat even when the system size $L_x$ is small along the direction perpendicular to the junctions (in which case one would naively expect a large overlap between the bound state wavefunctions resulting in significant energy splitting).  This property can be understood by noting that wavefunctions (\\ref{h5}) remain {\\em exact} zero modes of the Hamiltonian (\\ref{h1}) for periodic boundary conditions along $x$ as long as $\\Delta(x)$ averages to zero over all $x$ and $\\mu=(2\\pi v/L_x)n$ with $n$ integer.

The exact zero modes persist for all allowed values of $k_y$ in this more general case. \n\nIt is easy to see that breaking ${\\cal T}$ lifts the zero modes: for instance interpolating between $-\\Delta_0$ and $+\\Delta_0$ through complex values of $\\Delta(x)$ moves MZMs to finite energies. Flat Majorana bands are thus protected by ${\\cal T}$ and by translation symmetry that is necessary to establish the underlying momentum space Weyl structure.  \n\nTo ascertain the validity and robustness of the above analytic results we now study the problem using a lattice model for the Weyl semimetal.

The proximity effect is studied using the BdG Hamiltonian (\\ref{h1}) with $h_0$  replaced by $h_{\\rm latt}$ and $\\Delta$ taken to be non-zero in the surface layers only. Top row in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig2} summarizes our results. The normal state shows gapless Fermi arcs (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig2}a,b) while  uniform SC order is seen to gap out the Fermi arc states except in the vicinity of the Weyl points where they merge into the gapless bulk continuum (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig2}c). Presence of the $\\pi$ junctions (which we define parallel to the $y$ crystal axis) generates perfectly flat bands at zero energy between the projected Weyl nodes, Fig.\\ \\ref{fig2}d. We note that due to the periodic boundary conditions adopted in both $x$ and $y$ directions our numerics by necessity implement two parallel $\\pi$ junctions  which results in twice the number of flat bands compared to a single junction. We also find that, remarkably, the bands remain completely flat even when the system size $L_x$ is small along the direction perpendicular to the junctions (in which case one would naively expect a large overlap between the bound state wavefunctions resulting in significant energy splitting).  This property can be understood by noting that wavefunctions (\\ref{h5}) remain {\\em exact} zero modes of the Hamiltonian (\\ref{h1}) for periodic boundary conditions along $x$ as long as $\\Delta(x)$ averages to zero over all $x$ and $\\mu=(2\\pi v/L_x)n$ with $n$ integer. These conditions are satisfied for two equally spaced junctions and $\\mu=0$ used in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig2}. We checked that violating these conditions indeed leads to zero mode splitting that depends exponentially on the junction distance. Importantly, the fact that this detailed property of the simple model (\\ref{h2}) is borne out in a more realistic lattice model gives us confidence that the low energy theory provides a correct description of the physical surface state of a Weyl semimetal.\n\nThe lattice Hamiltonian (\\ref{h6}) has high symmetry with Weyl nodes confined to lie on the $k_y$ axis. It is important to verify that the phenomena discussed above are not dependent on such a fine tuned lattice symmetry. To this end we perturb $h_{\\rm latt}$ by adding to it \n\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{h7}\n\\delta h_{\\rm latt}({\\bm k})=\\epsilon\\ \\sigma^y s^x(1-\\cos{k_y}-\\cos{k_z}),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\delta h_{\\rm latt}({\\bm{k}})=\\epsilon\\ \\sigma^{y}s^{x}(1-\\cos{k_{y}}-\\cos{k_{%&#10;z}}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>latt</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><mi>\u03f5</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>y</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mi>x</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>y</mi></msub></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>z</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01727.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nand has a spectrum $E_{\\bm k}=\\sqrt{(vk_x-\\mu)^2+(v_\\Delta k_y)^2}$. For $\\mu=0$ this corresponds to a single gapless Majorana mode (with anisotropic dispersion) and a point node located at the center of the surface BZ. For nonzero $\\mu$ the node is shifted by $\\mu/v$ along the $k_x$ axis. Furthermore, when the mirror symmetry is broken the node can move away from the axis. Since all discrete symmetries are now broken (except for the particle-hole symmetry intrinsic to all BdG Hamiltonians) we expect the massless Majorana mode to be stable to all perturbations that do not destroy the SC order or the underlying Weyl semimetal. \n\nTo summarize, SC proximity effect in the surface of a Weyl semimetal produces an interesting interfacial superconductor with unique properties. In ${\\cal T}$-preserving Weyl materials (relevant to the recently identified Weyl semimetals  \\cite{hasan1,lv1,yan1,lv2,yang1,hasan2})  the observable signature consists of protected flat Majorana bands that occur at zero energy in a linear Josephson $\\pi$-junction defined on the surface. The flat bands span projections of the bulk Weyl points with opposite chirality onto the one dimensional edge BZ along the junction. We have demonstrated the existence and robustness of such flat bands in a minimal model with ${\\cal N}=4$ Weyl nodes but expect the signature to survive in materials with larger ${\\cal N}$. The flat bands are experimentally observable by tunneling into the junction region \\cite{Pill1,Seu1} and are likely to have consequences for the current-phase relation of the junction. They also provide a unique opportunity to study interaction effects in Majorana systems because even weak interactions can have profound consequences in a flat-band setting  \\cite{potter1,chiu1}. Unlike the Fu-Kane superconductor, where vortex core MZMs occur against a bulk insulator with a large gap, the phenomena discussed here take place on the surface of a gapless semimetal. Bulk gapless excitations can thus complicate their experimental detection. We note, however, that the density of states in a Weyl semimetal $D(\\omega)\\sim \\omega^2$ at low energy and will thus be vanishingly small near the $\\omega=0$ neutrality point. Majorana flat bands on the other hand give rise to a divergent density of states and thus should be well visible in a tunneling experiment.\n\nMajorana surface states, including flat bands, have been theoretically predicted to occur in various 2D and 3D topological and nodal superconductors \\cite{ReviewQiZhang,schnyder1,meng1,cho1,fawang1,wong1,hosur1}. With the exception of high-$T_c$ cuprates, where dispersionless edge states are known to exist (and were reinterpreted recently as Majorana flat bands \\cite{potter1}), these have not been observed experimentally because of the general paucity of topological superconductors. Majorana flat bands discussed in this Letter only require ingredients that are currently known to exist -- a ${\\cal T}$-preserving Weyl semimetal interfaced with an ordinary superconductor -- and are thus promising candidates for experimental detection. The massless Majorana mode predicted to exist in the surface of a ${\\cal T}$-breaking Weyl semimetal will become observable once such materials have been identified.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors are indebted to T.
