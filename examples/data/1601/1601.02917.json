This approach is based on the underlying paradigm that\nthe interesting dynamics of multi-agent systems emerge from the\ncorrect definition of few parameters governing the evolution of each\nindividual. Into this context, we propose a particular model of opinion\ndynamics based on the psychological construct named \"cognitive\ndissonance\". Our system is made of interacting individuals, the\nagents, each bearing only two dynamical variables (respectively\n``opinion'' and ``affinity'') self-consistently adjusted during time\nevolution. We also define two special classes of interacting\nentities, both acting for a peace mediation process but via\ndifferent course of action: ``\\textit{diplomats}'' and\n``\\textit{auctoritates}''. The behavior of the system with and\nwithout peace mediators ($PM$s) is investigated and discussed with\nreference to corresponding psychological and social implications.\n\n\\ \n\n\\noindent \\textbf{Keywords:} {opinion dynamics, complex systems, peace mediation, social psychology, cognitive dissonance} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\textbf{PACS:} {89.65.Ef, 89.75.-k, 82.20.Wt}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn recent years we have seen the emergence of a new breed of\nprofessionals broadly called Peace Mediators, $PM$s for short,\ninvolved in the process of peace (re)construction. They are usually deployed\nin countries torn by conflict or post-conflict areas in order to\ncreate conditions for sustainable peace. $PM$s actions aim to\nreduce the fragmentation among different parts of the society until\na widespread consensus is achieved and peace can be maintained.\n\nOur model is based on the assumption that it is possible to study\nthe evolution of a social phenomenon by directly considering a few\nof attributes of the individuals coupled by specific interaction\nrules. For these reasons, we adopt an agent based model, in which\nlocal rules are inspired by the \\textit{cognitive dissonance}~\\cite{1},\na cognitive construct that rules the evolution of human\nsocial cognition~\\cite{3}. According to the Cognitive Dissonance Theory,\nwhen unknown individuals interact, they experiment an\n\\textit{internal conflicting state} because of their respective lack\nof information. In order to avoid the cognitive dissonance,\nindividuals adopt heuristics strategies with the aid of \\textit{mental\nschemes}~\\cite{2}, that is, symbolic and synthetic representations built up\nthrough inferential, imaginative and emotional processes. Because\nmental schemes can be upgraded in real time during interactions with\nother individuals, they are used as a guidance for quick decisions\nin stereotypical situations. The mutual affinity is the\nmental scheme employed to overcome this lack and to perform the\noptimal choice in terms of opinion production. Two heuristic\nstrategies are generally employed:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[A)] if the affinity towards the interacting partner is below some\nthreshold, then the individual will tend to crystallize its actual\nopinion, while for higher values of affinity he will change its\nopinion in the direction of the partner's one;\n\\item[B)] if the opinion difference between the two interacting agents\nis below a critical value, then each one will increase its affinity\ntowards the partner, otherwise the affinity score will decrease.\n\\end{itemize}\nThese two way of acting are modulated by internal factors, such as\nthe \\textit{openness of mind} and the\n\\textit{confidence} (the openness of mind is the limit of\npermissiveness that individual introduces interacting with other\npeople and allows to ignore the perception of incompatibilities\nexisting between oneself and others and consequently to interact\nwith individuals having very distant opinions, the confidence is the\nminimal reputation required to accept instance from others, and\nexternal ones, such as the possibility of interacting given by its\nown social system. Moreover, affinity acts as a long term memory in\nwhich individuals can store information useful to solve similar\nfuture situations.\n\nBy formalizing agents in such a way, we will obtain a dynamical\npopulation where interacting agents share their opinions by trying\nto maintain an acceptable level of dissonance. The asymptotic states\nof such system are either a global consensus (i.e. into an\nhypothetical opinion space, a mono-clustered state) or a social\nfragmentation (i.e. crystallization of no longer interacting\nclusters of opinion). Of course, in the goal of $PM$, latter state\nmust be considered \\textit{dangerous}, since once obliged to\ninteract, the low level of mutual affinity and the differences in\nopinion, may lead to strong social contrasts between these agents.\nFor this reasons, the goal of $PM$ can be translated into a\nreduction of the social fragmentation, namely into a reduction of\nopinion distances of agents into the opinion space.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present two possible models of $PM$\nbehavior. In the first case, we emphasize principally the skill of\ninteracting and negotiating with people along large opinion\ndistances. We label these $PM$s as ``\\textit{diplomats}'' and we tag\ntheir most prominent characteristic as openness of mind. Classical\nexamples are actual diplomats, transactors, intermediaries, etc. On\nthe other hand, we consider as fundamental attribute the $PM$\nreputation. The source of information is an essential ingredient to\nlet the information to enter and spread into a population. We hence\nlabel this $PM$ figure by ``\\textit{auctoritas}'', being\ncharacterized by an established opinion and the aptitude to\ninfluence the society by their prestige. For sure we can set in this\ncategory Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.\n\nTargets of this work are to obtain a mathematical representation of\nboth $PM$'s figures and to investigate how they can affect a\nformalized social system of \\textit{normal} agents in order to reach\na widespread social consensus.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. The next section is dedicated to\ndescribe the model. In forthcoming section we present numerical\nsimulations. Fifth section is devoted to essential results and in\nthe last section we will sum up and talk about future perspectives.\n\n\\\n\n\\section{The Model}\n\\label{model}\n\nWe approach the problem by means of the tools and methods of\nSociophysics~\\cite{Cas,Sen}.\nIn particular, the adopted model has already been studied in previous studies~\\cite{3,4,5}.\nHereby we briefly recall its main features. The model is characterized by a\ncontinuous opinion and a random binary encounter dynamics, as in\nthe Deffuant Model~\\cite{Def1,Def2}, which ours is inspired to. We\nconsider a system made up by $N$ autonomous agents, the\nindividuals, each one identified by the index $i=1,\\dots,N$ and characterized\nby the two (constant) parameters $\\Delta O^i_c$ and $\\alpha^i_c$, which are the\nopenness of mind and the confidence, respectively. Moreover, each agent $i$ is\nin general described by the two internal variables $O_i$, its opinion, and $\\alpha_{ij}$\n($j=1,\\dots,N;\\ j\\neq i$), its affinity towards the other agents, which vary in time.\nAll $\\Delta O^i_c$, $\\alpha^i_c$, $O_i$ and $\\alpha_{ij}$ are real numbers\nranging in the interval $[0, 1]$.\nThe internal variables evolve self-consistently during time evolution.\nMore precisely, consider an agent $i$ interacting with another agent $j$.\nThen, the opinion $O_i$ and the affinity $\\alpha_{ij}$ are updated as follows:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nO_i^{t+1} &=& O_i^{t} - \\mu \\ \\Delta O_{ij}^{t} \\ \\Gamma_1(\\alpha^t_{ij}) \\label{opinion} \\\\\n\\alpha_{ij}^{t+1} &=& \\alpha_{ij}^{t} + \\alpha_{ij}^{t} \\\n[1-\\alpha_{ij}^{t}] \\ \\Gamma_2 (\\Delta O^t_{ij}) \\label{alpha}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the functions $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$ read, respectively:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Gamma_1(\\alpha^t_{ij}) &=& \\frac{1}{2} \\ [\\tanh \\ (\\beta_1 \\ (\\alpha_{ij}^{t}-\\alpha^i_c)) + 1] \\\\\n\\Gamma_2(\\Delta O^t_{ij}) &=& -\\tanh \\ (\\beta_2 \\ (|\\Delta O_{ij}^{t}|\n- \\Delta O^i_c))\n\\end{eqnarray}\nbeing $\\Delta O^t_{ij}$ the difference at time $t$ between the two\nopinion values of the interacting partners, $\\mu$ a convergence\nparameter and $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ set large enough to consider\nthe activating functions as step functions.\n\nAt each elementary time step the two interacting agents are selected as follows:\nthe agent $i$ is drawn with uniformly distributed probability from the population,\nwhilst agent $j$ is the one which minimizes the social metric\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nD_{ij}^t = d_{ij}^t + \\eta (0,\\sigma) \\label{social_metric} \\ , \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"D_{ij}^{t}=d_{ij}^{t}+\\eta(0,\\sigma)\\ ,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>D</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mi>t</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>d</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mi>t</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b7</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo rspace=\"7.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02917.tex", "nexttext": "\nand the gaussian noise ($\\eta$) with mean value zero and variance\n$\\sigma$, called \\textit{social temperature}~\\cite{2}, modulating the\nmixing degree in the population.

According to Eq. \\ref{opinion},\nthis way of acting will lead to an increase of the individuals\naffinity towards \\textit{diplomats}. On the other hand,\n\\textit{auctoritates} are assumed to employ their notoriety; this is\ntranslated in our model by imposing that all agents have a larger\naffinity value towards them, directly promoting the convergence into\nopinion space.\n\n\\\n\n\\section{Numerical simulations}\n\\label{numsec}\n\nSimulations are performed with following parameters. $N$ is fixed\nonce for all to $100$, including $PM$s. The social temperature $\\sigma$, the affinity threshold $\\alpha_c$ and the convergence\nparameter $\\mu$ are fixed once for all, respectively at $0.003$,\n$0.5$ and $0.5$. \\textit{Normal} agents have a $\\Delta O_c = 0.2$,\nwhile for \\textit{diplomats} $\\Delta O_c = 0.5$. Entries in the\naffinity matrix $\\alpha$ are initialized between \\textit{normal}\nagents with uniformly distributed probability in $[0, 0.5]$, while\nentries corresponding to \\textit{normal} agents towards\n\\textit{auctoritates} are set at $0.75$.\n\nWe have considered both the fraction of $PM$s over the entire\npopulation and their distribution in the opinion space as the\nrelevant control parameters, hereby measuring the mean number of\nsurvived clusters at the equilibrium over 100 runs. The range of\nemployed $PM$s is from $5\\%$ to $50\\%$ in steps of $5\\%$.\nWe remark that, so as formalized, the increase of fraction of $PM$s can\ncorresponds respectively either to a fixed number of $PM$s having to\ndo with smaller group, or to a population having a higher mean\n$\\Delta O_c$ (\\textit{diplomats}).\n\nRuns are stopped when the system converge to an equilibrium\nasymptotic state. We define such a state is reached when the\naffinity matrix will no longer change. We know that for communities\nlarger than $20$ agents, the system converge with respect to the\nopinion before than respect to the affinity~\\cite{5}. Hence, when\naffinity reaches a state where it no longer evolves, the whole\nsystem, i.e. also the opinion, will freeze. Such asymptotic state\nwill be characterized by the number of clusters in the opinion\ndimension.\n\n\\textbf{Scenarios}. The behavior of the two $PM$s figures are\nseparately studied in a starting system which entries of opinion\nvector $O$ are initialized uniformly spaced in $[0,1]$.\n\\textit{Diplomats} are distributed along the opinion space by\nsubstituting them to the already initialized \\textit{normal} agents\nand according with the following modalities. In the\n``\\textit{uniform}'' distribution \\textit{diplomats} are spread\nalong the opinion space with uniformly distributed probability; in\nthe ``\\textit{gaussian}'' one with a gaussian distribution (mean\n$0.5$, standard deviation $0.2$); in the ``\\textit{bimodal}''\ndistribution they are inserted with a bimodal distribution.\n\nThe same opinion vector initialization and strategy distribution\nare used for \\textit{auctoritates}, with the addition of a\n``\\textit{delta}'' strategy in which all \\textit{auctoritates} are\ngrouped around the center of the opinion space, namely around $0.5$.\n\n\\textbf{The ``\\textit{two opposing factions}'' case}. Hereby we\npropose an application of the model. We consider a starting opinion\nspace in which agents are divided into two large clusters, such that\ntheir respective opinion distances are larger than the opinion\nthreshold of any single agent. In such a way, there is no\npossibility of interaction between agents belonging to the two\ndifferent groups. Nevertheless, \\textit{diplomats} are able to\ninteract with both factions because of their large openness of mind,\nwhile \\textit{auctoritates} can attract individuals because of their\nhigh reputation. We thus compare the two different courses of\naction.\nIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of their action, we tested every\nconfiguration with a different density of mediators, from zero up to $50\\%$\n(of course, such a high presence of mediators does not take place in the real\nworld, anyway it is useful to reach it for a better theoretical understanding of\ntheir role).\n\n\\\n\n\\section{Results}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=16.0cm]{Fig01.jpg}\n\\caption{Typical opinion trajectories.

While the system of\n\\textit{normal} agents quickly converge to a fragmented asymptotic\nstate, the insertion of $PM$s increases the convergence time needed\nas so as the chances of obtaining a mono-clustered state. We remark\nthe different courses of action of the two $PM$s. Because of the\ngreat $\\Delta O_c$ value, \\textit{diplomat} increases affinity\ntowards neighbourhood, approaches partner and inclines it towards\nits own opinion. Agents inside the opinion bounds of\n\\textit{diplomat} have a larger probability of collapse in the same\nfinal position, and the \\textit{diplomat} has the possibility to\nexplore the entire opinion space. On the other hand,\nan \\textit{auctoritas} tends to reach the equilibrium with the same\nopinion value with respect to the initial condition. In this latter\ncase, the affinities of \\textit{normal} agents towards\n\\textit{auctoritates} trigger the convergence dynamics to\nmonocluster.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=15.0cm]{Fig02.jpg}\n\\caption{Behavior of a system modulated by\n\\textit{diplomats}, spread as in legend. a) Mean number of survived\nclusters at the equilibrium as a function of the fraction of\n\\textit{diplomats}. b) Probability of having N clusters at the\nequilibrium in a single run, 5\\% of \\textit{diplomats} (upper\nfigure), 50\\% of \\textit{diplomats} (lower).

In Figure~\\ref{fig:fig1}a an example of how dynamics takes place in this case is depicted. We can utilize a simple mean-field treatment to describe the dynamics.

In this latter\ncase, the affinities of \\textit{normal} agents towards\n\\textit{auctoritates} trigger the convergence dynamics to\nmonocluster.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=15.0cm]{Fig02.jpg}\n\\caption{Behavior of a system modulated by\n\\textit{diplomats}, spread as in legend. a) Mean number of survived\nclusters at the equilibrium as a function of the fraction of\n\\textit{diplomats}. b) Probability of having N clusters at the\nequilibrium in a single run, 5\\% of \\textit{diplomats} (upper\nfigure), 50\\% of \\textit{diplomats} (lower).

In Figure~\\ref{fig:fig1}a an example of how dynamics takes place in this case is depicted. We can utilize a simple mean-field treatment to describe the dynamics.

On the other hand, in Figure~\\ref{fig:fig1}a we show the time evolution of a system with $\\sigma=0.003$, $\\Delta O_c=0.2$ and $\\langle\\alpha_{ij}\\rangle=0.25$ (see Ref.~\\cite{3} again), that is with $\\Delta=0.0008\\ll\\Delta_c$, and actually consensus is not reached, compatibly with the considerations stated above.\n\nDespite the roughness of the previous calculations, this approach allow us to reckon at least qualitatively the effect of the presence of the peace mediators on the ultimate fate of the system. As a matter of fact, auctoritates increase the average $\\langle\\alpha_{ij}\\rangle$, and in a similar way diplomats increase the average $\\langle\\Delta O_c^i\\rangle$, which substitutes the simple $\\Delta O_c$ in Eqs.~(\\ref{mf1}) and~(\\ref{delta}): therefore, both make the quantity $\\Delta$ of the system larger, enhancing the reaching of final consensus, as confirmed by the numerical results presented in the previous section.\n\n\\ \n\n\\section{Conclusions and future perspectives}\n\nIn this paper we propose an application of the model of continuous\nopinion dynamics already introduced in~\\cite{3,4,5}, by inserting\ntwo figures of $PM$s, one by one either \\textit{diplomats} or\n\\textit{auctoritates} respectively, into a population of\n\\textit{normal} agents. We describe the behavior of the system in\nterms of opinion convergence and mean degree of fragmentation for\ndifferent fraction of employed $PM$s, also in reference to a more\nlikely situation, namely the case ``\\textit{two opposing\nfactions}''.\n\nThe typical \\textit{modus operandi} of \\textit{diplomats} becomes\nmore effective by inserting many of them. By referring to what we said\nin section~\\ref{numsec},\nboth the insertion of few \\textit{diplomats} into groups of small\nsize and the increase of the mean $\\Delta O_c$ value of the\npopulation would lead to the same result. On the other hand, the\npromotion of few \\textit{auctoritates}, but in suitable positions,\ncan assure the convergence to a widespread consensus into\npopulations of any sort.\n\nThe combined efforts of both the two kinds of $PM$s remain to be further investigated,\nas so as the effects of the population size and the time needed by\nsuch figures in order to reach the global consensus. Deeper studies,\nboth of analytical and experimental nature, are needed in the next future.\n\n\\ \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nWork supported by Commission (FP7-ICT-2013-10) Proposal No. 611299 SciCafe 2.0 and by project CLARA (CLoud plAtform and smart underground imaging for natural Risk Assessment), funded by the Italian Ministry of Education and\nResearch (PON 2007-2013: Smart Cities and Communities and Social Innovation; Asse e Obiettivo: Asse II - Azione Integrata per la Societ\\`a dell'Informazione; Ambito: Sicurezza del territorio)\n\n\\ \n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{20}\n\\bibitem{1} L.
