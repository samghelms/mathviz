The effect of scintillation is most apparent when only a small\nnumber of observations are used to estimate the flux density and is further\nexacerbated when observations make use of short integrations and/or small\nbandwidths.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fluxes.ps}\n    \\caption{\n        Measured 1.4\\,GHz flux densities of {33\\xspace} pulsars estimated from\n        averaging over multiple {PSRIX\\xspace} observations (filled circles).

Fortunately, this was only an issue\nwhen observing extremely strong sources (e.g. flux calibrators with the noise\ndiode). We find no anomalies in the observed pulse profiles, allowing these\nobservation from late-2013 to mid-2014 to be used for timing.\n\n\\subsection{Clock Stability}\n\\label{sec:stability}\nThe {PSRIX\\xspace} system suffered four clock offsets over its first four years\nof operation. The first offset occurred between 2012~Oct.~27 and Nov.~10, and\nwas due to switching clock sources without measuring the phase difference\nbetween their signals. The second offset, which occurred on 2013~July~27, was\ncaused by cutting the power to the clock signal generator and not re-syncing\nthe phase of the signal after the system was restarted. The third offset was\ndeliberately introduced on 2014~Mar.~4 when the clock signal was synchronised\nto the original clock phase.  Finally, the fourth offset on 2014~Nov.~20 was\nalso deliberately introduced by installing a new clock signal generator. \n\nThe first two clock offsets were initially measured by fitting timing data for the\norbital phase of PSR~J0348+0432. These measurements were sufficiently precise\nto determine the offsets to within one phase rotation of PSR~J0348+0432 ($P \\simeq\n39$\\,ms), allowing the values to be further refined by fitting arbitrary time\noffsets (``JUMPs'') to the timing residuals\nof PSR~J0348+0432 and then with PSR~J1744$-$1134 ($P \\simeq 4.1$\\,ms). The\nfinal values of the clock offsets have been measured by fitting JUMPs\nindividually to the timing data of four pulsars, namely PSRs~J0613$-$0200,\nJ1643$-$1224, J1713+0747, and J1744$-$1134. These were selected on the basis of\nbeing of the most precisely timed pulsars in the {PSRIX\\xspace} data set. The JUMPs\nwere fit simultaneously with pulsar parameters and noise models using\n{\\texttt{TempoNest}\\xspace} \\citep{lah+14}. The resulting JUMP values, all of which were\nmeasured relative to the original clock signal, were averaged together\nresulting in measurements of $\\Delta T_A=97.2851(6)$\\,ms and $\\Delta\nT_B=409.2691(8)$\\,ms.  These measurements have been confirmed with data from\nLEAP by measuring and comparing the phase delays between the signals of\nsimultaneous observations with several European radio telescopes before and\nafter the epochs of the {PSRIX\\xspace} clock offsets \\citep[see][ for an overview of\nthe project]{bjk+15}.\\footnote{The precision of the LEAP-based measurements is\nexpected to surpass what is possible with timing-based JUMP measurements.\nHowever, the uncertainties of the LEAP-based measurements are not yet well\ndetermined, so here we report the values and uncertainties derived from the more\nstandard and conservative JUMP measurements.} The third and fourth offsets were\ndirectly measured at the telescope by comparing clock signals with an\noscilloscope. The results are high-precision measurements of $\\Delta\nT_C=0.000612(1)$\\,ms and $\\Delta T_D=0.000127(1)$\\,ms, which are consistent\nwith offset values derived from fitting JUMPs to pulsar timing data.\n\nA schematic of the {PSRIX\\xspace} clock offsets is shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:clockoffset}. The timing residuals of PSR~J1713+0747 after the\nJUMPs are removed show no evidence of the clock offsets, as shown in the bottom\npanel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:clockoffset}. Similarly, the residuals of all other\npulsars are also free of the effect of the clock offsets after applying the\noffsets listed above.\n\nNote that the EBPP uses an independent reference clock, and thus was not\naffected by any of the four offsets seen in the {PSRIX\\xspace} data.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{clock_offset.ps}\n    \\caption{\\textit{Top} -- A schematic of the four clock offsets suffered by\n        the {PSRIX\\xspace} system.

We have found that {PSRIX\\xspace} provides\nsignificantly stronger detections, roughly 2--5 times higher {$S/N$\\xspace}, than the\nsimultaneously recorded EBPP data. A similar comparison of TOA uncertainties\nderived for simultaneous {PSRIX\\xspace} and EBPP data also shows improvements of a\nfactor of 2--5.\n\nThere are several reasons why {PSRIX\\xspace} outperforms the EBPP: \n\n\\noindent 1) The 200-MHz bandwidth of {PSRIX\\xspace} is considerably larger than the\nEBPP's usable bandwidth ($\\sim$40--50\\,MHz for most pulsars, and\n$\\sim$95\\,MHz for pulsars with $\\mathrm{DM} \\lapp 10$\\,{$\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$\\xspace}).\nA comparison of the observing bands from both backends is shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:bandcompare}. {PSRIX\\xspace}'s larger bandwidth allows more signal to\nbe integrated, reducing radiometer noise, and also increases the chance of\nobserving constructive scintels. \n\n\\noindent 2) The {PSRIX\\xspace} data are recorded with 8 bits, making them even more\nresilient in the presence of strong RFI than the EBPP with its 4-bit data.\n\n\\noindent 3) The 10-s sub-integrations of {PSRIX\\xspace} are much shorter than the\n2-min sub-integrations of the EBPP. Thus, the expense of removing impulsive\nRFI is diminished. Also, the shorter sub-integrations make re-aligning the\npulse profiles with an updated timing model more accurate. \n\n\\noindent 4) {PSRIX\\xspace} is a more robust instrument than the EBPP. This is\nespecially true now that the latter is nearly 20 years old, and hardware and\nnetworking issues occasionally preclude it of recording data. In these\ninstances, data files are cut short, or not written at all. \n\nThe increase in bandwidth of {PSRIX\\xspace} over the EBPP is even more apparent when\nfull polarisation information is recorded. Polarisation observations with the\nEBPP are limited to only 28\\,MHz, whereas with {PSRIX\\xspace} full polarisation\ninformation can be recorded for up to 500\\,MHz of bandwidth. Moreover, because\nrecording polarisation information required the EBPP to be set up in a special\nmode prior to commencing observations, it is much less flexible than\n{PSRIX\\xspace}, which always provides full Stokes parameters for timing-mode\nobservations.\n\nIn addition to investigating individual observations, we also examined the\ntiming data of several pulsars to compare the timing stability achievable with\n{PSRIX\\xspace} vs. the EBPP. Depending on the pulsar, we found the weighted\nroot-mean-square (RMS) of the {PSRIX\\xspace} timing residuals is a factor of\n$\\sim$1.3--3 times better than that of the EBPP over the same time interval. In our\nanalysis, we whitened the timing residuals with three frequency derivatives and\ntwo DM derivatives to not be biased by the effects of pulsar spin noise and DM\nvariations.\\footnote{The timing residuals from {PSRIX\\xspace} and the EBPP\n    closely trace the residuals from other EPTA telescopes, so we are confident\n    that the systematic trends we are removing are not instrumental.} We also\n    removed the four clock offsets affecting {PSRIX\\xspace} data mentioned in\n    {\\S}~\\ref{sec:stability}. \nThe smallest improvement factor we found (1.3$\\times$) was for PSR~J1744$-$1134.\nThis is because the pulsar's particularly low DM of 3.1\\,{$\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$\\xspace} made it\npossible for the EBPP to coherently dedisperse $\\sim$95\\,MHz of usable\nbandwidth. \n\nDespite {PSRIX\\xspace} providing better detections than the EBPP, we still observe\nwith both backends in parallel whenever possible, to extend the latter's nearly\n20-year long data set.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{ebpp_snr_comparison.ps}\n    \\caption{Comparison of {$S/N$\\xspace} for simultaneous observations with the {PSRIX\\xspace} and\n             EBPP backends.

The one observation of PSR~J1713+0747 where the {$S/N$\\xspace}\n             is larger in the EBPP observation is due to there being a single\n             scintillation maximum within the 200-MHz {PSRIX\\xspace} band that falls\n             inside the smaller EBPP observing window. Note that we did not\n             weight the frequency channels by {$S/N$\\xspace} when integrating the band.\n             \\label{fig:snrcompare}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{band_comparison.ps}\n    \\caption[Comparison between simultaneous observations with the {PSRIX\\xspace} and EBPP backends]\n            {\\textit{Left} -- The integrated pulse profile and frequency vs.\n                phase plot for a 28-min observation with {PSRIX\\xspace} of\n                PSR~J1713+0747 on 2013 Jan 6.

The\nintegrated pulse profiles from individual high-frequency observations are shown\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:highfreq}.  PSRs~J1012+5307, J1713+0747, B1937+21 were\nobserved twice at 5\\,GHz, and PSR~J2145$-$0750 was observed twice each 5 and\n9\\,GHz. \n\n\n\nDetails of the 5 and 9-GHz observations presented in\nTable~\\ref{tab:highfreq}.\n\nTo flux calibrate our observations, we observed 3C~48 at both 5 and 9\\,GHz\non 2015 Jan. 7 and again on 2015 Jan. 24.  These observations were used to\nderive calibrated flux densities of our observations at these frequencies. We\nobserved the pulsars to have flux densities ranging from 0.2 to 1.5\\,mJy at\n5\\,GHz, and from 0.2 to 0.3\\,mJy at 9\\,GHz (see Table~\\ref{tab:highfreq}). We\nfound some variation in the measured flux densities of the pulsars observed\nmultiple times. However, these variations are consistent with amplitude\nmodulations expected from weak scintillation at these frequencies\n\\citep[e.g.][]{lk04}. \n\nFor each of our high-frequency observations, we computed TOA uncertainties\nusing an analytic template, which was generated by fitting von~Mises-shaped\npulse components to the summed profile.

This data set is the\nsuccessor of the venerable EBPP data set, and includes stronger detections and\nmore precise TOAs thanks to the larger bandwidth and more robust design of\n{PSRIX\\xspace}.\n\n\\subsection{Improved Sensitivity to a GW Background}\n\\label{sec:gwbsensitivity}\n\nOne of the primary goals of our monthly observations with {PSRIX\\xspace} is to \ncontribute to the EPTA and IPTA objective of detecting the GWB. To this end, we\nwill be combining our observations with the EPTA and IPTA data sets. \n\nWe have estimated the improvement to GWB sensitivity made possible by switching\nfrom the EBPP to {PSRIX\\xspace} for two separate scenarios: first, assuming all\npulsars exhibit only pure white noise (e.g. radiometer noise or from pulse\njitter), and second, assuming the pulsars also suffer from red noise following a\npower-law spectrum (e.g. from intrinsic spin noise or uncorrected DM\nvariations).  In both cases, we considered a 7-pulsar\\footnote{We used the\npositions of PSRs~J0218+4232, J0613$-$0200, J1022+1001, J1600$-$3053,\nJ1713+0747, B1855+09, and J2145$-$0750.  Because we are computing improvement\nfactors, we find there is no significant difference in the results as the\nnumber of pulsars is increased.} hybrid data set that combines the higher\ntiming precision of the {PSRIX\\xspace} TOAs with the longevity of the existing EBPP\ndata set.  We then compared our results for this hybrid data set to a\nhypothetical extension of the current EBPP data set without having switched to\n{PSRIX\\xspace}. \n\nIn our first set of estimates, we assumed pulsars with pure white noise timing\nresiduals. We assumed the timing residuals RMS in EBPP data is ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}\n= 1$\\,$\\mu$s, and the RMS of {PSRIX\\xspace} residuals is improved by a factor $\\eta$\n(i.e. ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{{P}} = {\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}/\\eta$).  We performed separate\nestimates for\n$\\eta=2$,~3,~and~5. For simplicity, we also assumed that the phase offset between the EBPP-era\ndata and the {PSRIX\\xspace}-era data is perfectly determined.  We then used the\nCram\\'er-Rao Bound \\citep[e.g.][]{fis63} to compute the minimum GWB amplitude\nrequired to reject the null hypothesis, which was that there is no GWB (i.e. a\nzero-amplitude GWB) at the 1\\,$\\sigma$ level. A more complete description of the use of the\nCram\\'er-Rao Bound in the context of estimating PTA sensitivity to the GWB can\nbe found in \\citet{cll+15}. In making our estimates, we assumed\nthat the GWB signal has a power-law strain spectrum with an index of $-$2/3,\nappropriate for an isotropic stochastic background of super-massive black hole\nbinaries.  Improvement factors were determined by comparing the GWB amplitude\nderived for the hybrid data set with the analogous value computed for the pure\nEBPP-style data set.  Our estimated improvement factors for $\\eta=2$,~3,~and~5\nas a function of date are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:gwbimprove}.\n\nOur second set of estimates are determined following the same procedure\ndescribed above, but assuming an additional red noise contribution to the timing\nresiduals.  We used a red noise spectrum with an amplitude corresponding to\n${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{red} = 100$\\,ns and a spectral index of $\\alpha_\\mathrm{red} =\n-1.5$ for all pulsars. This optimistically flat value of $\\alpha$ is within the\nmeasured range for MSPs, $-7 \\lapp \\alpha \\lapp-1$\n\\citep[e.g.][]{abb+15,cll+15}.\\footnote{MSPs with very steep spectral indices (e.g. B1937+21) are not typically used in searches for the GWB.} Even when assuming this nearly best-case red\nnoise spectrum, we find the overall improvement in sensitivity to\nthe GWB is considerably reduced.  This is because only the power of the white\nnoise is reduced by switching to {PSRIX\\xspace}. It is, therefore, the red noise\nrestricts the sensitivity to the GWB.  We also find that the improvement factor\nsaturates earlier because the low frequencies probed as the data set is\nextended are dominated by red noise.  Thus, in the red-noise case, these lowest\nfrequencies contribute little sensitivity to the GWB. The improvement factors\nfor GWB sensitivity found for these red noise cases are indicated with the red\ncurves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:gwbimprove}. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the black and red curves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:gwbimprove} is\ncaused by the presence of red noise, which can arise from a variety of sources\n\\citep[see e.g.][]{cs10}. While it may not be possible to fully remove the\ndeleterious effect of red noise from pulsar timing data, some of these noise\nprocesses (e.g. from the ISM -- see {\\S}~\\ref{sec:highfreqpta}) can be\nmitigated, further improving the prospects for the detection of the GWB.\n\nAs suggested by \\citet{sejr13}, another way to counter the loss of sensitivity\nto the GWB due to pulsars' red timing noise is to include other, possibly newly\ndiscovered MSPs in PTAs. This exemplifies the importance of on-going high time\nand frequency radio pulsar surveys such as the Pulsar Arecibo L-Band Feed Array\n(PALFA) survey \\citep{lbh+15}, the High-Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) surveys\n\\citep{kjv+10,bck+13}, and the Greenbank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) survey\n\\citep{slr+14}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{asterix_improve_gwb_limit.ps}\n    \\caption{\n        Estimated improvement in sensitivity to the GWB as a function of date\n        provided by including {PSRIX\\xspace} data compared to a hypothetical extended EBPP-only\n        data set.  We have assumed white noise with ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}=1$\\,$\\mu$s\n        for EBPP-era data (1997 to 2011), and ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{{P}} =\n        {\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}/\\eta$ for {PSRIX\\xspace} data.

See text for additional discussion.\n    \\label{fig:gwbimprove}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{PTA Monitoring of MSPs at High Frequencies}\n\\label{sec:highfreqpta}\n\nISM variations, primarily DM variations, can introduce a significant amount of red noise into the timing\nresiduals of some MSPs \\citep[e.g. {{Lentati et al., in prep.;}}][]{cs10,\nkcs+13,lbj+14}. This can be a major hindrance to reliably detecting\nlong-timescale signals in the data (e.g. the nHz GWB spectrum being searched\nfor with PTAs).  Thus, mitigating ISM variations is of great importance. In\ngeneral, this can be accomplished in two ways: 1) by avoiding ISM variations,\neither by discarding data sets contaminated by ISM variations or by observing\nat frequencies high enough that the amplitude of ISM-induced noise is\nsufficiently small \\citep[e.g. as was done by][]{srl+15}, and 2) by removing\nthe ISM effects, either by leveraging multi-frequency and wide-band\nobservations to measure DM variations \\citep[e.g.][]{kcs+13,dfg+13,abb+15}.\n\nThe effect of the ISM diminishes with increasing observing frequency:\nDM delays scale as $\\tau_d \\propto f^{-2}$ \\citep[e.g.][]{lk04} and pulse\nbroadening caused by interstellar scattering scales as $\\tau_s \\propto\nf^{-3.86\\pm0.16}$ \\citep{bcc+04}. Therefore, pulsar timing data from\nhigh-frequency observations will contain less significant red ISM noise.  Unfortunately,\nthe radio spectra of pulsars, which are generally described by a simple power\nlaw, $S \\propto f^{\\alpha}$, are rather steep, with spectral indices of $-1\n\\lapp \\alpha \\lapp -2$ \\citep{mkkw00,blv13}, making it difficult to completely\navoid ISM variations while maintaining the {$S/N$\\xspace} required for high-precision\ntiming.  Thus, in practice, ISM effects cannot be completely ignored by\nobserving at arbitrarily high frequencies. Some effort to remove these effects\nis necessary.\n\nWhen removing DM variations the key resulting quantity is the infinite-frequency TOA,\n$T_\\infty$ (i.e. the DM-corrected TOA). Estimates of $T_\\infty$ can be made by\ncombining multi-frequency observations or by splitting a single wide-band\nobservation into multiple sub-bands \\citep[see e.g.][]{lbj+14}.

This new\n    ROACH-based system enables bandwidths up to 500\\,MHz to be recorded,\n    significantly more than what was possible with its predecessor, the\n    Effelsberg-Berkeley Pulsar Processor (EBPP). We review the first four years\n    of {PSRIX\\xspace} timing data for {33\\xspace} pulsars collected as part of the monthly\n    European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) observations. We describe the automated\n    data analysis pipeline, {\\texttt{CoastGuard}\\xspace}, that we developed to reduce these \n    observations. We also introduce {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace}, the EPTA timing database used to\n    store timing results, processing information and observation metadata. Using\n    these new tools, we measure the phase-averaged flux densities at 1.4\\,GHz of all\n    33 pulsars. For 7 of these pulsars, our flux density measurements are the\n    first values ever reported. For the other 26 pulsars, we compare our flux\n    density measurements with previously published values.  By comparing\n    {PSRIX\\xspace} data with EBPP data, we find an improvement of $\\sim$2--5 times\n    in signal-to-noise ratio achievable, which translates to an increase of\n    $\\sim$2--5 times in pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) precision.  We show that\n    such an improvement in TOA precision will improve the sensitivity to the\n    stochastic gravitational wave background.  Finally, we showcase the\n    flexibility of the new {PSRIX\\xspace} backend by observing several\n    millisecond-period pulsars (MSPs) at 5 and 9\\,GHz.  Motivated by our\n    detections, we discuss the potential for complementing existing pulsar\n    timing array data sets with MSP monitoring campaigns at these frequencies.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\n    pulsars: general -- stars: neutron -- gravitational waves\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:Introduction}\nPulsars are extremely useful tools for studying various fields of astrophysics.\nMany important results are the product of regular timing campaigns that are\nused to determine models of pulsars' rotation capable of accounting for every\nrotation of the star.  High-precision timing observations of millisecond-period\npulsars (MSPs) have proven to have a large number of diverse applications, such\nas testing of relativistic gravity \\citep[e.g.][]{ksm+06}, constraining the\nequation-of-state of ultra-dense matter \\citep[e.g.][]{dpr+10}, and studying\nbinary stellar evolution \\citep[e.g.][]{fbw+11}. In general, studies of radio\npulsars have also been used to probe the interstellar medium\n\\citep[e.g.][]{bgr98,bm08,efk+13}. Furthermore, collections of MSPs are being\nobserved regularly as part of so-called pulsar timing array (PTA) projects,\nwhich have the ultimate goal of detecting low-frequency gravitational waves,\npossibly arising from the cosmic population of super-massive black-hole\nbinaries \\citep[e.g.][]{ses13} or from cosmic strings \\citep[e.g.][]{sbs12}.\n\nTo maximise the scientific potential of pulsar timing observations, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio ({$S/N$\\xspace}) observations are required to determine pulse times\nof arrival (TOAs) precisely.  Given a telescope, the {$S/N$\\xspace} can be improved\neither by increasing the integration time, which is limited by the total available\ntelescope time and the number of pulsars to observe, or by using more sensitive and/or\nwider bandwidth receivers. In order to fully leverage wider bandwidths,\ninstruments capable of processing the increased frequency range\nmust be used.\n\nThe Effelsberg-Berkeley Pulsar Processor (EBPP) coherent dedispersion backend\n\\citep{bdz+97} has been running since 1995. Its long, uniform data sets for\nsome MSPs have enabled unique studies. For example, \\citet{sck+13} used EBPP\ndata to constrain profile variations in MSPs, and thus improve limits on the\nviolation of local Lorentz invariance of gravity by several orders of magnitude\nrelative to previously published limits \\citep[see][and references\ntherein]{wil93}. The EBPP data set has also been a key component of several\nEuropean Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) projects, such as characterising the noise\nproperties of MSPs \\citep{cll+15}, constraining the\nlow-frequency gravitational wave background \\citep[GWB;][]{ltm+15}, and\nsearching for single sources of gravitational waves (GWs; {{Babak et al., accepted}}).\n\nThe EBPP is beginning to show its age. For instance, the EBPP bandwidth\nis limited to only $\\sim$64--128\\,MHz, depending on the integrated Galactic\nelectron content along the line-of-sight to the pulsar (i.e. the pulsar's\ndispersion measure, DM), whereas most current receiver systems operating in\nthe 1--3\\,GHz band can simultaneously observe bandwidths of 200--800\\,MHz\n(e.g. the Greenbank Ultimate Pulsar Processing Instrument -- GUPPI --\nused at the Green Bank Telescope, and its clones PUPPI and NUPPI at the Arecibo\nand Nan\\c{c}ay observatories, respectively \\citealp{fdr10}), and in the case of the\nUltra-Broadband (UBB) receiver at Effelsberg, $\\sim$2600\\,MHz.  Furthermore,\nthe EBPP hardware is becoming increasingly unreliable, and replacement parts\nare increasingly difficult to come by.\n\nFor these reasons, the EBPP backend was replaced as the main data\nrecorder for pulsar timing observations at Effelsberg by the {PSRIX\\xspace} backend\nin 2011 March. {PSRIX\\xspace} is built around a Reconfigurable Open Architecture\nComputing Hardware (ROACH) system, a programmable platform designed by the\nCollaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research\n(CASPER).\\footnote{https://casper.berkeley.edu/} The EBPP is still run in\nparallel with {PSRIX\\xspace} whenever possible.\n\n{PSRIX\\xspace} was originally designed as part of the Large European Array for\nPulsars (LEAP) project \\citep{bjk+15}, which has the\nobjective of coherently combining signals from the five largest European radio\ntelescopes.\\footnote{Specifically, the Lovell Telescope, the Westerbork\nSynthesis Radio Telescope, the Nan\\c{c}ay Telescope, the Sardinia Radio\nTelescope, and Effelsberg.} To meet this goal, the primary mode of operation of\n{PSRIX\\xspace} is to record baseband data, however, additional modes were implemented\nto record coherently dedispersed profiles folded in real-time and coherently\ndedispersed single pulses.\n{PSRIX\\xspace}'s coherent-dedispersion modes support bandwidths up to 500\\,MHz and\nare flexible enough to observe at different frequencies, taking advantage of\nEffelsberg's many receivers. Technical details of the backend design and the\nimplementation its various modes of operation will be described in a future\npaper.\n\nThanks to the increased bandwidth and more robust design of {PSRIX\\xspace} compared\nto the EBPP, the timing campaigns undertaken at Effelsberg using {PSRIX\\xspace} are\nproducing data of superior quality, thus enabling even\nhigher-precision timing studies than previously possible. Moreover, {PSRIX\\xspace}\nmay further improve the prospects of high-precision timing at Effelsberg by\nmaking it is possible to conduct timing observations of MSPs at 5\\,GHz and\nhigher, helping to mitigate noise arising from variations of the ISM along the\nline of sight towards the pulsar, a serious impediment to searches for GWs with\nPTAs.\n\nThe EPTA has previously incorporated the\n$\\sim$17-year-long EBPP data set into its timing analyses and GW searches\n\\citep[e.g. {{Desvignes et al., submitted;}}][]{jsk+08,lwj+09,lvt+11,ltm+15}.\nHere we describe the {PSRIX\\xspace} data and its analysis, which will be\nincluded in future EPTA projects and be shared with the International\nPulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration ({{Verbiest et al., submitted}}). \n\nIn addition to the monthly observing sessions of many binary pulsars and MSPs,\nseveral pulsars have been the target of dedicated observing campaigns with\n{PSRIX\\xspace} over the past four years. In particular, {PSRIX\\xspace} data were included in the\nIPTA effort to observe PSR~J1713+0747 continuously for 24 hours using the\nlargest radio telescopes around the Earth \\citep{dlc+14}. Also,\n    PSR~J0348+0432, a 2-{\\mbox{$M_\\odot$}\\xspace} pulsar in a $\\sim$2.5\\,hr relativistic binary\n    with a white-dwarf companion \\citep{lbr+13,afw+13}, has been regularly\n    observed for full orbits using {PSRIX\\xspace}. Several full-orbit observing\ncampaigns of PSR~J1518+4904, a 41-ms pulsar in an 8.6-day double-neutron-star\nbinary, have been conducted with {PSRIX\\xspace} to precisely measure the mass of the\npulsar and its companion ({{Janssen et al., in prep.}}).\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows.\nSection~\\ref{sec:observations} describes the monthly EPTA observations\nundertaken with the Effelsberg telescope using {PSRIX\\xspace}. The analysis of these\nobservations is detailed in {\\S}~\\ref{sec:analysis}, and includes an overview\nof the automated data reduction suite {\\texttt{CoastGuard}\\xspace}, as well as the timing\ndatabase {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace}. Flux density measurements for {33\\xspace} pulsars at 1.4\\,GHz and\na comparison between {PSRIX\\xspace} and the old EBPP backends are presented in\n{\\S}~\\ref{sec:results}, as are the results of observations at 5 and 9\\,GHz.\nThe results are discussed in {\\S}~\\ref{sec:discussion} and the paper is\nfinally summarised in {\\S}~\\ref{sec:conclusion}.\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{sec:observations}\nEvery month, the Effelsberg radio telescope is used to observe bright, stable\nMSPs as part of the EPTA project. These observations are conducted with\n{PSRIX\\xspace} in its coherent-dedispersion real-time folding mode, evenly dividing\nthe pulse profiles into 1024 phase bins. Each session typically consists of\nobservations at both 1.4 and 2.6\\,GHz (wavelengths of 21 and 11\\,cm,\nrespectively). The 1.4-GHz observations use either the central feed of the\n7-beam receiver (called ``P217mm'') or the single-feed 1.4\\,GHz receiver\n(``P200mm'').\\footnote{http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/effelsberg/astronomen} Both\nof these 1.4-GHz receivers are situated in the primary focus of the Effelsberg\ntelescope.  Only one of the 1.4-GHz receivers is installed for any given\nobserving session.  We use whichever receiver is available. The 2.6-GHz\nobservations are done with the ``S110mm'' secondary-focus receiver.  {PSRIX\\xspace}\nis used to record a 200-MHz band, which is divided into eight 25-MHz sub-bands.\nIn the case of P200mm and S110mm observations, this exceeds the available\nbandwidths of 140\\,MHz and 80\\,MHz, respectively. See Table~\\ref{tab:obssetup}\nfor details of the observing set-ups used. All of the receivers used in this\nwork have circularly polarised feeds.\n\nWhenever possible, we record data with the EBPP coherent-dedispersion pulsar\ntiming backend in parallel with {PSRIX\\xspace}. This allows for a more accurate\ndetermination of the time offset between the two instruments. We have also used\nthese simultaneous observations to characterise the improvement of {PSRIX\\xspace}\nover the EBPP (see {\\S}~\\ref{sec:ebppcompare}).\n\nOur monthly EPTA observing sessions typically consist of 24 hours at 1.4\\,GHz\nand 12--24 hours at 2.6\\,GHz. Each observing session includes pulsar\nobservations of $\\sim$30\\,--\\,60\\,min in duration. Polarisation calibration scans\nare conducted prior to each pulsar observation and each consist of a 2-min\nintegration of the receiver noise diode offset by 0.5{$^\\circ$\\xspace} from the pulsar\nposition. The diode is pulsed with a 1-s repetition rate and a 50\\% duty cycle.\n\nSince 2013, at 1.4\\,GHz, we also performed on- and off-source scans of a\nradio source with a stable, well-known flux density, usually 3C~218 (i.e.\nHydra~A). These flux calibration observations use the noise diode as\ndescribed above.\n\nEvery month, we observe $\\sim$45 pulsars at 1.4\\,GHz and $\\sim$20\npulsars at 2.6\\,GHz. Pulsars that are never, or rarely, detected at 2.6\\,GHz\nduring a 6--12 month probationary period are dropped from the regular\nobserving schedule. Here we focus on the data sets of {33\\xspace} MSPs and\nbinary pulsars acquired between 2011 and 2015. Tables~\\ref{tab:obssumm 21cm}\nand~\\ref{tab:obssumm 11cm} show a summary of our 1.4~and 2.6\\,GHz observations\nof these pulsars, respectively.\n\nAs we will discuss in {\\S}~\\ref{sec:highfreqpta}, since ISM effects weaken\nwith increasing radio frequency, high-frequency observations of pulsars may be\nextremely useful to avoid and mitigate the effects of variability in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), which limit the sensitivity of attempts at detecting\nGWs with pulsars.  In 2015 January, we conducted observations of 12 MSPs at\n5\\,GHz (6\\,cm) using the ``S60mm'' secondary-focus receiver with the aim of\nassessing their utility to the PTAs. We used {PSRIX\\xspace} in its 500-MHz\ncoherent-dedispersion real-time folding mode for these 5 observations.  We also\nobserved four of these pulsars at 9\\,GHz (3.6\\,cm) with the ``S36mm'', also a\nsecondary-focus receiver, again with 500\\,MHz of bandwidth. Our high-frequency\nobservations are listed in Table~\\ref{tab:highfreq}. We selected the pulsars\nfor these exploratory high-frequency observations based on their 1.4 and\n2.6\\,GHz detection significances, which we scaled to higher frequencies using\nthe radiometer equation, the receiver performance, and published spectral\nindices. \\footnote{For pulsars without spectral indices available in the\nliterature, we used a spectral index of $\\alpha = -2$ for our estimates.}\nSpecifically, we required an estimated ${$S/N$\\xspace}\\;\\gapp\\!10$ for a 30-min observation\nwhen selecting pulsars for the preliminary 5 and 9-GHz observations reported\nhere. High-frequency observations of other (fainter) MSPs are being conducted\nand will be reported elsewhere.\n\n\\section{Data Analysis}\n\\label{sec:analysis}\n\n\\subsection{CoastGuard: An Automated Timing Data Reduction Pipeline}\n\\label{sec:coastguard}\nWe developed an automated pipeline, {\\texttt{CoastGuard}\\xspace},\\footnote{Available at\nhttps://github.com/plazar/coast\\_guard} to reduce {PSRIX\\xspace} data. {\\texttt{CoastGuard}\\xspace}\nis written in python and is largely built around programs from the {\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace}\npackage\\footnote{http://psrchive.sourceforge.net/} \\citep{hvm04}, using\nits python wrappers to read {PSRIX\\xspace} data files, which are\n{\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace}-compatible. {\\texttt{CoastGuard}\\xspace} contains components that are sufficiently\ngeneral for use with {\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace}-compatible data files from other observing\nsystems despite that it was primarily designed for Effelsberg {PSRIX\\xspace} data. In\nparticular, the radio frequency interference (RFI) removal algorithm described\nbelow has been applied to data from the Parkes Telescope \\citep{cbb+14} and has\nalso been adopted by the LOFAR pulsar timing data reduction pipeline\n\\citep{kvh+15}.\n\n{\\texttt{CoastGuard}\\xspace} contains considerable error checking, logging, logistics, and\ncontrol logic required to automate large portions of the pipeline, which is\nmarshalled by a control script and a MySQL database.\n\nIn its coherent-dedispersion real-time folding mode the {PSRIX\\xspace} backend writes\ndata files every 10\\,s for each 25-MHz sub-band.  These fragments are then\ngrouped together and combined using {\\texttt{psradd}\\xspace}. At this stage, the data are\nre-aligned using an up-to-date pulsar ephemeris, if necessary, and 12.5\\,\\%\nof the channels at the edge of each sub-band are zero-weighted to reduce the\neffect of aliasing. \n\nNext, the metadata stored in these consolidated files are cross-checked\nagainst telescope observing logs and all discrepancies are corrected. This is\nprimarily to repair issues with the observation metadata that were common\nduring the commissioning of {PSRIX\\xspace}. These issues have since been resolved.\n\nThe data files are then cleaned of RFI. In the pipeline, our cleaning process\nexcludes RFI by setting the weights of individual profiles to zero. That is,\nthe data from RFI-affected sub-integration/channel combinations are ignored in\nthe rest of the analysis without altering the data values.  Therefore, it is\npossible to reverse the automated RFI masking.\n\n{\\texttt{CoastGuard}\\xspace}'s RFI-excision script, {\\texttt{clean.py}\\xspace}, includes four distinct algorithms\nthat can be chained together to clean corrupted data.  Each algorithm has\nseveral parameters that can be used to optimise its performance.  In our\nautomated data analysis, we use two of the four available cleaning algorithms,\nnamely \\texttt{rcvrstd} and \\texttt{surgical}.  The other two algorithms,\n\\texttt{bandwagon} and \\texttt{hotbins}, are occasionally applied manually to\nobservations requiring special attention.  Our standard RFI excision algorithm\nproceeds as follows: \n\nFirst, {\\texttt{clean.py}\\xspace}'s \\texttt{rcvrstd} algorithm is used to zero-weight frequency\nchannels beyond the receiver response and channels falling within a list of\nreceiver-dependent bad frequency intervals.\n\nSecond, the \\texttt{surgical} algorithm is used to find profiles corrupted by\nRFI in the folded data cube. To avoid being biased by the presence of the\npulsar signal, the amplitude and phase of the integrated pulse profile is fit\nusing a least-squares algorithm to individual profiles containing a significant\ndetection and the difference is computed.  It is these pulsar-free residuals\nthat are treated in the remainder of the algorithm.  Next, RFI-contaminated\ndata are identified with a set of four metrics, which are computed for each\nsub-integration/channel pair (i.e.  each total-intensity profile stored in the\ndata file). These metrics are: 1) the standard deviation, 2) the mean, 3) the\nrange, and 4) the maximum amplitude of the Fourier transform of the\nmean-subtracted residuals. These four metrics were selected due to their\nsensitivity to the RFI signals present in Effelsberg data, which include, but\nare not limited to: excess noise, occasional data drop-outs, and infrequently,\nrapid (sub-ms) periodic bursts. For each metric, a $N_\\mathrm{sub} \\times\nN_\\mathrm{chan}$-sized matrix of values is produced.  Trends in the rows and\ncolumns of these matrices are removed by subtracting piece-wise quadratic\nfunctions that were fit to the data. The subtraction of these trends account\nfor slow variations in time, as well as the shape of the bandpass. These\nrescaled matrices are then searched for outliers, which are defined as being\n$>$5\\,$\\sigma$ from the median of either their sub-integration or channel.\nFinally, profiles that are identified as an outlier by at least two of the four\nmetrics are zero-weighted.\n\nThe \\texttt{bandwagon} algorithm completely removes sub-integrations and\nchannels that already have a sufficiently large fraction of data masked, and\nthe \\texttt{hotbins} algorithms replaces outlier off-pulse profile phase-bins\nwith locally sourced noise.\\footnote{Because the \\texttt{hotbins} algorithm\nreplaces data, it is irreversible.} Neither of these two algorithms are part of our\nstandard automated data reduction.\n\nOnce the observations are cleaned, they are reviewed before proceeding with\nthe rest of the automated analysis. This is to identify observations that still need\nto be cleaned manually. In practice, only a small fraction of observations\nrequire additional RFI zapping. This quality-control stage also provides an\nopportunity to identify observations where the pulsar is not detected or where\nthe data are contaminated by RFI beyond repair. Observations falling into these\ntwo categories do not continue further in the data reduction process. \n\nThe above data reduction process (combine, correct, clean, quality control) is\nalso applied to polarisation calibration scans of the noise diode.\nThe cleaned and vetted calibration scans are fully time-integrated, and then \nloaded into the appropriate {\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace} {\\texttt{pac}\\xspace}-compatible ``database'' files.\nThe pipeline maintains one calibration database file for each pulsar.\n\nPolarisation calibration of the cleaned pulsar data files is performed with\n{\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace}'s {\\texttt{pac}\\xspace}\nprogram,\\footnote{http://psrchive.sourceforge.net/manuals/pac/} using its\n``SingleAxis'' algorithm, which appropriately adjusts the relative gain and\nphase difference of the two polarisation channels by applying the technique\nof \\citet{bri00}.  These calibrated observations are manually\nreviewed a second time to verify that no artifacts have been introduced. \n\nFlux calibration has not been incorporated into the automated data analysis\npipeline. Nevertheless, we have manually performed flux calibration wherever\npossible. In our analysis we used {\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace}'s {\\texttt{fluxcal}\\xspace} and {\\texttt{pac}\\xspace} programs.\n{\\texttt{fluxcal}\\xspace} compares the power levels of on- and off-source observations of a\nstandard candle target to determine the system equivalent flux density over the\nobserving band. This information is used to determine the flux density scale of\nthe polarisation-calibrated pulsar observations.\n\nFor this paper we refolded all data with up-to-date ephemerides.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{TOASTER: The TOAs Tracker Database}\n\\label{sec:toaster}\nWe have developed a python package, TOAS TrackER\n({\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace}),\\footnote{{\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} and its documentation are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/plazar/toaster} for computing and storing TOAs in a fully\ndescribed and reproducible way. At its core, {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} consists of an SQL\ndatabase and full-featured python toolkit for reliably interacting with the\ndata and database.  \n\nBeyond simply storing TOA information, {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace}'s database also records\ninformation about telescopes and observing systems, observation information\n(e.g. frequency, epoch, integration time, the ephemeris used for folding), the\nstandard profile used to determine each TOA, as well as version\nnumbers of relevant software, such as {\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace} and {\\texttt{TEMPO2}\\xspace} \\citep{hem06}.  \n\nOnce the database is populated, {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} can also launch TOA generation\nprocesses that use a variety of ``manipulators'' to prepare the data prior to\nautomatically computing TOAs using standard {\\texttt{psrchive}\\xspace} tools. The most basic\nmanipulator fully integrates data in frequency and time. However, more\nsophisticated manipulations can be included to adjust the data according to an\nupdated, possibly time-varying DM, integrate a fixed number of pulses or\nvariable number of pulses depending on the resulting {$S/N$\\xspace}. Manipulators can\nalso be used to scale the measured profiles to have uniform off-pulse variance,\nas was done by \\citep{abb+15}. Typically these types of manipulations are included\nin the data reduction pipelines that prepare observations prior to determining TOAs.\nBy performing these data reduction steps in {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace}, the details of the\nmanipulations performed on the data and the resulting TOAs are logged in the\ndatabase, making it easy to store the resulting TOAs, as well as systematically\ncompare the effect of different manipulations on the eventual timing analysis.\nFurthermore, the {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} database includes a reference to the template used to\ncompute each TOAs. The end result is a completely described and reproducible\nTOA-generation procedure. This makes {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} a useful tool for high-precision\ntiming projects like the EPTA and IPTA that are constantly adding new data, as\nwell as developing new data reduction algorithms.\n\nThe {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} toolkit scripts can be used to easily query the information stored\nin its database.  For example, {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} provides scripts to list and summarise\nthe TOAs in the database. These scripts can also be used to generate TOA files in\nmultiple formats, including a {\\texttt{TEMPO2}\\xspace} format that includes all the\nannotations (``TOA flags'') requested by the IPTA. \n\n{\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} can be used to load TOAs directly into the database (i.e.  without\ninformation concerning the observations, templates, etc.). This feature is\nuseful for including previously computed, and finalised, data sets, such as the\nEPTA legacy TOAs {{(Desvignes et al., submitted)}}.\n\nWe set up the {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} software and database to manage the reduced (i.e.\ncleaned and calibrated) {PSRIX\\xspace} data, which are automatically loaded into the\n{\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace} database by the data reduction pipeline described in\n{\\S}~\\ref{sec:coastguard}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\n\nOver the past four years, we have collected timing data on 45 pulsars at\n1.4~and 2.6\\,GHz using the {PSRIX\\xspace} backend with the 100-m Effelsberg\nradio telescope. Here we report on a selection of {33\\xspace} pulsars. Most of these\npulsars have been monitored monthly in both bands for the entire 4-year period.\nAn overview of our 1.4~and 2.6\\,GHz observations can be found in\nTables~\\ref{tab:obssumm 21cm} and~\\ref{tab:obssumm 11cm}, respectively.\n\n\\subsection{Flux Density Measurements}\n\\label{sec:fluxes}\n\nWe measured flux densities for all {33\\xspace} pulsars at 1.4\\,GHz. For each pulsar,\nwe report the mean flux density, $\\left < S \\right >$, and the median flux\ndensity, $S_\\mathrm{med.}$, to account for observed modulation due to\ninterstellar scintillation.

Note, that doubling the\n             integration time only improves $\\sigma_\\infty$ by $\\sqrt{2}$.\n             \\label{fig:highfreq_comparison}\n            }\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor simplicity, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:highfreq_comparison} we have assumed the\nentire recorded bandwidth is summed to form a single TOA. This is a reasonable\nassumption given recent work on wide-band template matching\n\\citep{pdr14,ldc+14}. In fact, by using these new wide-band TOA determination\nalgorithms it is possible to simultaneously account for profile evolution, DM\nvariations, scattering, and scintillation while summarising wide-band\nobservations into a single TOA. \n\nClearly, complementing {PSRIX\\xspace} TOAs with observations using the Effelsberg\nLOFAR station, provides precise DM-corrected TOAs.  However, there are some\ncomplications with using low-frequency data to remove DM variations.  First,\nthe background of Galactic synchrotron emission is strong and line-of-sight\ndependent \\citep{hssw82}. Thus, MSPs in unfortunate directions may be too weak\nto use low-frequency observations to make DM measurements.  Another possible\ncomplication, not included in our estimates, is spectral turnover, which occurs\nin a significant fraction of MSPs \\citep{kvl+15}. This also conspires to weaken\ndetections at low frequencies.  Finally, there is concern that the DMs measured\nat low frequencies are different than those measured at higher\nfrequencies due to differences in the ISM probed as a result of interstellar\nscattering \\citep{css15}.\n\nOur 5 and 9-GHz detections of several MSPs indicate that complementing\ntiming campaigns at 1 to 3\\,GHz with observations at higher frequencies might\nbe a viable alternative for mitigating ISM effects.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:highfreq_comparison} includes estimates of $\\sigma_\\infty$\nattainable by complementing 1.4\\,GHz {PSRIX\\xspace} data with observations from\ncurrent and planned receiver systems. Using the current 5-GHz\nset-up with {PSRIX\\xspace} should provide better TOA precision than the 2.6-GHz\nset-up described in {\\S}~\\ref{sec:observations} for $\\alpha \\gapp -1.9$, \nas well as better $\\sigma_\\infty$ for $\\alpha \\gapp -2.25$, thanks to the larger\nfrequency separation between the bands. \n\nWe also examined new wide-bandwidth receivers coming online, such as the\n0.6-to-2.7-GHz UBB receiver at\nEffelsberg,\\footnote{Currently, the UBB receiver at Effelsberg can observe\nfrequencies as low as 0.6\\,GHz. However, since the RFI is particularly\nstrong below 1\\,GHz, a high-pass filter will be installed around 1.1\\,GHz to\nimprove the overall performance of the receiver.} as well as the new 4-to-9-GHz ``C+'' \nreceiver currently being commissioned at\nEffelsberg, and the 1.8-to-3.5-GHz receivers being designed at the MPIfR for\nMeerKAT.  The assumed receiver parameters are\nshown Table~\\ref{tab:otherrcvr}. \n\nEffelsberg's C+ receiver and the MeerKAT 1.8-to-3.5-GHz observing systems\npresent significant improvements in the bandwidths currently available for\npulsar timing at these frequencies, and thus provide compelling cases for using\nhigh-frequency observations to mitigate ISM-related noise. Furthermore, other\nsensitive high-frequency observing systems (e.g. the 3.85--6\\,GHz ``C-band''\nreceiver at the Arecibo Observatory, the 2--4\\,GHz ``S-band'' system at the\nJansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and the 4--8\\,GHz ``C-band'' system at the\nJVLA) should be considered for regular PTA monitoring of MSPs. Furthermore, the\npotential high-frequency capabilities of the SKA could also be important for\nPTA-studies.\n\nNote that, at $\\sim$5\\,GHz we expect slow, roughly hourly, intensity variations\nof only $\\sim$10~to~30\\,\\%. Also, the attenuation of the transmission of radio waves\nthrough the atmosphere due to water vapour only becomes a concern at\n$f\\gapp$10\\,GHz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen formulating observing strategies for high-precision,\nmulti-frequency timing campaigns, deciding what observing systems to use\nshould depend on the spectral index of the pulsar, the magnitude of the noise\nintroduced by ISM effects, and the shape of the pulse profile, including the\ndegree of profile broadening. Furthermore, deciding how often multi-frequency\nobservations are necessary for a particular pulsar depends on the timescale of\nthe DM variations affecting the pulsar \\citep[see e.g.][]{kcs+13}.  At\nEffelsberg, because the secondary-focus receivers are always available, and can\nbe switched-to within minutes, issues arising from the non-simultaneity of\nmulti-frequency observations described by \\citet{lccd15} are not a concern, as\nthey may be at other telescopes. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\nWe have described how the {PSRIX\\xspace} backend is being used at the Effelsberg\nradio telescope for monthly EPTA observations. The coherently dedispersed data\nfrom {PSRIX\\xspace} have a larger bandwidth than what is possible with its\npredecessor, the EBPP. As a result, the now four-year-old {PSRIX\\xspace} data set has\nstronger detections, more precise TOAs, and will improve the sensitivity to the\nGWB compared to the EBPP data.\n\nWe have also shown how bright, highly stable MSPs being monitored by the EPTA\ncan be detected at 5 and 9\\,GHz. Given the reduced ISM effects at these\nfrequencies compared to 1.4\\,GHz and the ability to more precisely correct DM\nvariations, there could be advantages to complementing existing data sets\n(typically $1 \\lapp f \\lapp 3$\\,GHz) with observations at these higher\nfrequencies.  This is especially true considering the new wide-bandwidth,\nhigh-frequency receivers currently being commissioned, and those expected to\ncome online in the next few years.\n\\\\\n\n\\noindent We would like to thank Cees Bassa and Jason Hessels for helping to\nconceive and develop {\\texttt{TOASTER}\\xspace}.

Fortunately, this was only an issue\nwhen observing extremely strong sources (e.g. flux calibrators with the noise\ndiode). We find no anomalies in the observed pulse profiles, allowing these\nobservation from late-2013 to mid-2014 to be used for timing.\n\n\\subsection{Clock Stability}\n\\label{sec:stability}\nThe {PSRIX\\xspace} system suffered four clock offsets over its first four years\nof operation. The first offset occurred between 2012~Oct.~27 and Nov.~10, and\nwas due to switching clock sources without measuring the phase difference\nbetween their signals. The second offset, which occurred on 2013~July~27, was\ncaused by cutting the power to the clock signal generator and not re-syncing\nthe phase of the signal after the system was restarted. The third offset was\ndeliberately introduced on 2014~Mar.~4 when the clock signal was synchronised\nto the original clock phase.  Finally, the fourth offset on 2014~Nov.~20 was\nalso deliberately introduced by installing a new clock signal generator. \n\nThe first two clock offsets were initially measured by fitting timing data for the\norbital phase of PSR~J0348+0432. These measurements were sufficiently precise\nto determine the offsets to within one phase rotation of PSR~J0348+0432 ($P \\simeq\n39$\\,ms), allowing the values to be further refined by fitting arbitrary time\noffsets (``JUMPs'') to the timing residuals\nof PSR~J0348+0432 and then with PSR~J1744$-$1134 ($P \\simeq 4.1$\\,ms). The\nfinal values of the clock offsets have been measured by fitting JUMPs\nindividually to the timing data of four pulsars, namely PSRs~J0613$-$0200,\nJ1643$-$1224, J1713+0747, and J1744$-$1134. These were selected on the basis of\nbeing of the most precisely timed pulsars in the {PSRIX\\xspace} data set. The JUMPs\nwere fit simultaneously with pulsar parameters and noise models using\n{\\texttt{TempoNest}\\xspace} \\citep{lah+14}. The resulting JUMP values, all of which were\nmeasured relative to the original clock signal, were averaged together\nresulting in measurements of $\\Delta T_A=97.2851(6)$\\,ms and $\\Delta\nT_B=409.2691(8)$\\,ms.  These measurements have been confirmed with data from\nLEAP by measuring and comparing the phase delays between the signals of\nsimultaneous observations with several European radio telescopes before and\nafter the epochs of the {PSRIX\\xspace} clock offsets \\citep[see][ for an overview of\nthe project]{bjk+15}.\\footnote{The precision of the LEAP-based measurements is\nexpected to surpass what is possible with timing-based JUMP measurements.\nHowever, the uncertainties of the LEAP-based measurements are not yet well\ndetermined, so here we report the values and uncertainties derived from the more\nstandard and conservative JUMP measurements.} The third and fourth offsets were\ndirectly measured at the telescope by comparing clock signals with an\noscilloscope. The results are high-precision measurements of $\\Delta\nT_C=0.000612(1)$\\,ms and $\\Delta T_D=0.000127(1)$\\,ms, which are consistent\nwith offset values derived from fitting JUMPs to pulsar timing data.\n\nA schematic of the {PSRIX\\xspace} clock offsets is shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:clockoffset}. The timing residuals of PSR~J1713+0747 after the\nJUMPs are removed show no evidence of the clock offsets, as shown in the bottom\npanel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:clockoffset}. Similarly, the residuals of all other\npulsars are also free of the effect of the clock offsets after applying the\noffsets listed above.\n\nNote that the EBPP uses an independent reference clock, and thus was not\naffected by any of the four offsets seen in the {PSRIX\\xspace} data.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{clock_offset.ps}\n    \\caption{\\textit{Top} -- A schematic of the four clock offsets suffered by\n        the {PSRIX\\xspace} system.

We have found that {PSRIX\\xspace} provides\nsignificantly stronger detections, roughly 2--5 times higher {$S/N$\\xspace}, than the\nsimultaneously recorded EBPP data. A similar comparison of TOA uncertainties\nderived for simultaneous {PSRIX\\xspace} and EBPP data also shows improvements of a\nfactor of 2--5.\n\nThere are several reasons why {PSRIX\\xspace} outperforms the EBPP: \n\n\\noindent 1) The 200-MHz bandwidth of {PSRIX\\xspace} is considerably larger than the\nEBPP's usable bandwidth ($\\sim$40--50\\,MHz for most pulsars, and\n$\\sim$95\\,MHz for pulsars with $\\mathrm{DM} \\lapp 10$\\,{$\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$\\xspace}).\nA comparison of the observing bands from both backends is shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:bandcompare}. {PSRIX\\xspace}'s larger bandwidth allows more signal to\nbe integrated, reducing radiometer noise, and also increases the chance of\nobserving constructive scintels. \n\n\\noindent 2) The {PSRIX\\xspace} data are recorded with 8 bits, making them even more\nresilient in the presence of strong RFI than the EBPP with its 4-bit data.\n\n\\noindent 3) The 10-s sub-integrations of {PSRIX\\xspace} are much shorter than the\n2-min sub-integrations of the EBPP. Thus, the expense of removing impulsive\nRFI is diminished. Also, the shorter sub-integrations make re-aligning the\npulse profiles with an updated timing model more accurate. \n\n\\noindent 4) {PSRIX\\xspace} is a more robust instrument than the EBPP. This is\nespecially true now that the latter is nearly 20 years old, and hardware and\nnetworking issues occasionally preclude it of recording data. In these\ninstances, data files are cut short, or not written at all. \n\nThe increase in bandwidth of {PSRIX\\xspace} over the EBPP is even more apparent when\nfull polarisation information is recorded. Polarisation observations with the\nEBPP are limited to only 28\\,MHz, whereas with {PSRIX\\xspace} full polarisation\ninformation can be recorded for up to 500\\,MHz of bandwidth. Moreover, because\nrecording polarisation information required the EBPP to be set up in a special\nmode prior to commencing observations, it is much less flexible than\n{PSRIX\\xspace}, which always provides full Stokes parameters for timing-mode\nobservations.\n\nIn addition to investigating individual observations, we also examined the\ntiming data of several pulsars to compare the timing stability achievable with\n{PSRIX\\xspace} vs. the EBPP. Depending on the pulsar, we found the weighted\nroot-mean-square (RMS) of the {PSRIX\\xspace} timing residuals is a factor of\n$\\sim$1.3--3 times better than that of the EBPP over the same time interval. In our\nanalysis, we whitened the timing residuals with three frequency derivatives and\ntwo DM derivatives to not be biased by the effects of pulsar spin noise and DM\nvariations.\\footnote{The timing residuals from {PSRIX\\xspace} and the EBPP\n    closely trace the residuals from other EPTA telescopes, so we are confident\n    that the systematic trends we are removing are not instrumental.} We also\n    removed the four clock offsets affecting {PSRIX\\xspace} data mentioned in\n    {\\S}~\\ref{sec:stability}. \nThe smallest improvement factor we found (1.3$\\times$) was for PSR~J1744$-$1134.\nThis is because the pulsar's particularly low DM of 3.1\\,{$\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$\\xspace} made it\npossible for the EBPP to coherently dedisperse $\\sim$95\\,MHz of usable\nbandwidth. \n\nDespite {PSRIX\\xspace} providing better detections than the EBPP, we still observe\nwith both backends in parallel whenever possible, to extend the latter's nearly\n20-year long data set.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{ebpp_snr_comparison.ps}\n    \\caption{Comparison of {$S/N$\\xspace} for simultaneous observations with the {PSRIX\\xspace} and\n             EBPP backends.

The\nintegrated pulse profiles from individual high-frequency observations are shown\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:highfreq}.  PSRs~J1012+5307, J1713+0747, B1937+21 were\nobserved twice at 5\\,GHz, and PSR~J2145$-$0750 was observed twice each 5 and\n9\\,GHz. \n\n\n\nDetails of the 5 and 9-GHz observations presented in\nTable~\\ref{tab:highfreq}.\n\nTo flux calibrate our observations, we observed 3C~48 at both 5 and 9\\,GHz\non 2015 Jan. 7 and again on 2015 Jan. 24.  These observations were used to\nderive calibrated flux densities of our observations at these frequencies. We\nobserved the pulsars to have flux densities ranging from 0.2 to 1.5\\,mJy at\n5\\,GHz, and from 0.2 to 0.3\\,mJy at 9\\,GHz (see Table~\\ref{tab:highfreq}). We\nfound some variation in the measured flux densities of the pulsars observed\nmultiple times. However, these variations are consistent with amplitude\nmodulations expected from weak scintillation at these frequencies\n\\citep[e.g.][]{lk04}. \n\nFor each of our high-frequency observations, we computed TOA uncertainties\nusing an analytic template, which was generated by fitting von~Mises-shaped\npulse components to the summed profile.

This data set is the\nsuccessor of the venerable EBPP data set, and includes stronger detections and\nmore precise TOAs thanks to the larger bandwidth and more robust design of\n{PSRIX\\xspace}.\n\n\\subsection{Improved Sensitivity to a GW Background}\n\\label{sec:gwbsensitivity}\n\nOne of the primary goals of our monthly observations with {PSRIX\\xspace} is to \ncontribute to the EPTA and IPTA objective of detecting the GWB. To this end, we\nwill be combining our observations with the EPTA and IPTA data sets. \n\nWe have estimated the improvement to GWB sensitivity made possible by switching\nfrom the EBPP to {PSRIX\\xspace} for two separate scenarios: first, assuming all\npulsars exhibit only pure white noise (e.g. radiometer noise or from pulse\njitter), and second, assuming the pulsars also suffer from red noise following a\npower-law spectrum (e.g. from intrinsic spin noise or uncorrected DM\nvariations).  In both cases, we considered a 7-pulsar\\footnote{We used the\npositions of PSRs~J0218+4232, J0613$-$0200, J1022+1001, J1600$-$3053,\nJ1713+0747, B1855+09, and J2145$-$0750.  Because we are computing improvement\nfactors, we find there is no significant difference in the results as the\nnumber of pulsars is increased.} hybrid data set that combines the higher\ntiming precision of the {PSRIX\\xspace} TOAs with the longevity of the existing EBPP\ndata set.  We then compared our results for this hybrid data set to a\nhypothetical extension of the current EBPP data set without having switched to\n{PSRIX\\xspace}. \n\nIn our first set of estimates, we assumed pulsars with pure white noise timing\nresiduals. We assumed the timing residuals RMS in EBPP data is ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}\n= 1$\\,$\\mu$s, and the RMS of {PSRIX\\xspace} residuals is improved by a factor $\\eta$\n(i.e. ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{{P}} = {\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}/\\eta$).  We performed separate\nestimates for\n$\\eta=2$,~3,~and~5. For simplicity, we also assumed that the phase offset between the EBPP-era\ndata and the {PSRIX\\xspace}-era data is perfectly determined.  We then used the\nCram\\'er-Rao Bound \\citep[e.g.][]{fis63} to compute the minimum GWB amplitude\nrequired to reject the null hypothesis, which was that there is no GWB (i.e. a\nzero-amplitude GWB) at the 1\\,$\\sigma$ level. A more complete description of the use of the\nCram\\'er-Rao Bound in the context of estimating PTA sensitivity to the GWB can\nbe found in \\citet{cll+15}. In making our estimates, we assumed\nthat the GWB signal has a power-law strain spectrum with an index of $-$2/3,\nappropriate for an isotropic stochastic background of super-massive black hole\nbinaries.  Improvement factors were determined by comparing the GWB amplitude\nderived for the hybrid data set with the analogous value computed for the pure\nEBPP-style data set.  Our estimated improvement factors for $\\eta=2$,~3,~and~5\nas a function of date are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:gwbimprove}.\n\nOur second set of estimates are determined following the same procedure\ndescribed above, but assuming an additional red noise contribution to the timing\nresiduals.  We used a red noise spectrum with an amplitude corresponding to\n${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{red} = 100$\\,ns and a spectral index of $\\alpha_\\mathrm{red} =\n-1.5$ for all pulsars. This optimistically flat value of $\\alpha$ is within the\nmeasured range for MSPs, $-7 \\lapp \\alpha \\lapp-1$\n\\citep[e.g.][]{abb+15,cll+15}.\\footnote{MSPs with very steep spectral indices (e.g. B1937+21) are not typically used in searches for the GWB.} Even when assuming this nearly best-case red\nnoise spectrum, we find the overall improvement in sensitivity to\nthe GWB is considerably reduced.  This is because only the power of the white\nnoise is reduced by switching to {PSRIX\\xspace}. It is, therefore, the red noise\nrestricts the sensitivity to the GWB.  We also find that the improvement factor\nsaturates earlier because the low frequencies probed as the data set is\nextended are dominated by red noise.  Thus, in the red-noise case, these lowest\nfrequencies contribute little sensitivity to the GWB. The improvement factors\nfor GWB sensitivity found for these red noise cases are indicated with the red\ncurves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:gwbimprove}. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the black and red curves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:gwbimprove} is\ncaused by the presence of red noise, which can arise from a variety of sources\n\\citep[see e.g.][]{cs10}. While it may not be possible to fully remove the\ndeleterious effect of red noise from pulsar timing data, some of these noise\nprocesses (e.g. from the ISM -- see {\\S}~\\ref{sec:highfreqpta}) can be\nmitigated, further improving the prospects for the detection of the GWB.\n\nAs suggested by \\citet{sejr13}, another way to counter the loss of sensitivity\nto the GWB due to pulsars' red timing noise is to include other, possibly newly\ndiscovered MSPs in PTAs. This exemplifies the importance of on-going high time\nand frequency radio pulsar surveys such as the Pulsar Arecibo L-Band Feed Array\n(PALFA) survey \\citep{lbh+15}, the High-Time Resolution Universe (HTRU) surveys\n\\citep{kjv+10,bck+13}, and the Greenbank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) survey\n\\citep{slr+14}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{asterix_improve_gwb_limit.ps}\n    \\caption{\n        Estimated improvement in sensitivity to the GWB as a function of date\n        provided by including {PSRIX\\xspace} data compared to a hypothetical extended EBPP-only\n        data set.  We have assumed white noise with ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}=1$\\,$\\mu$s\n        for EBPP-era data (1997 to 2011), and ${\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{{P}} =\n        {\\mathrm{RMS}}_\\mathrm{E}/\\eta$ for {PSRIX\\xspace} data.

See text for additional discussion.\n    \\label{fig:gwbimprove}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{PTA Monitoring of MSPs at High Frequencies}\n\\label{sec:highfreqpta}\n\nISM variations, primarily DM variations, can introduce a significant amount of red noise into the timing\nresiduals of some MSPs \\citep[e.g. {{Lentati et al., in prep.;}}][]{cs10,\nkcs+13,lbj+14}. This can be a major hindrance to reliably detecting\nlong-timescale signals in the data (e.g. the nHz GWB spectrum being searched\nfor with PTAs).  Thus, mitigating ISM variations is of great importance. In\ngeneral, this can be accomplished in two ways: 1) by avoiding ISM variations,\neither by discarding data sets contaminated by ISM variations or by observing\nat frequencies high enough that the amplitude of ISM-induced noise is\nsufficiently small \\citep[e.g. as was done by][]{srl+15}, and 2) by removing\nthe ISM effects, either by leveraging multi-frequency and wide-band\nobservations to measure DM variations \\citep[e.g.][]{kcs+13,dfg+13,abb+15}.\n\nThe effect of the ISM diminishes with increasing observing frequency:\nDM delays scale as $\\tau_d \\propto f^{-2}$ \\citep[e.g.][]{lk04} and pulse\nbroadening caused by interstellar scattering scales as $\\tau_s \\propto\nf^{-3.86\\pm0.16}$ \\citep{bcc+04}. Therefore, pulsar timing data from\nhigh-frequency observations will contain less significant red ISM noise.  Unfortunately,\nthe radio spectra of pulsars, which are generally described by a simple power\nlaw, $S \\propto f^{\\alpha}$, are rather steep, with spectral indices of $-1\n\\lapp \\alpha \\lapp -2$ \\citep{mkkw00,blv13}, making it difficult to completely\navoid ISM variations while maintaining the {$S/N$\\xspace} required for high-precision\ntiming.  Thus, in practice, ISM effects cannot be completely ignored by\nobserving at arbitrarily high frequencies. Some effort to remove these effects\nis necessary.\n\nWhen removing DM variations the key resulting quantity is the infinite-frequency TOA,\n$T_\\infty$ (i.e. the DM-corrected TOA). Estimates of $T_\\infty$ can be made by\ncombining multi-frequency observations or by splitting a single wide-band\nobservation into multiple sub-bands \\citep[see e.g.][]{lbj+14}. The uncertainty\non $T_\\infty$ is $\\sigma_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\left < \\delta T_\\infty^2 \\right >}$,\nand in the two-band case, is given by \\citep[Eq.~12 of][]{lbj+14}\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n    \\left < \\delta T_\\infty^2 \\right > = \\frac{f_1^4 \\sigma_1^2 + f_2^4 \\sigma_2^2}\n                                              {\\left ( f_1^2 - f_2^2 \\right )^2 }, \n    \\label{eq:dmcorrect}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\left&lt;\\delta T_{\\infty}^{2}\\right&gt;=\\frac{f_{1}^{4}\\sigma_{1}^{2}+f_{2}^{4}%&#10;\\sigma_{2}^{2}}{\\left(f_{1}^{2}-f_{2}^{2}\\right)^{2}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>\u27e8</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>T</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo>\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>4</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></mrow><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
