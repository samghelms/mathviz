The masses of the asteroid and the spacecraft are represented as $M$ and $m$, respectively. Furthermore, $\\hat n$ represents\nthe asteroid surface normal vector at the impact location (of unit size), $\\hat n \\hat n$ is the dyadic product of the same and $\\mathcal I$ denotes the unit dyade \n(equivalent to the identity matrix, i.e. $\\mathcal I\\; \\vec v = \\vec v \\; \\mathcal I =\\vec v$). \nEquation (\\ref{eq:dv}) describes the direct momentum transfer due to the kinetic impactor\nas well as the indirect momentum transfer due to the ejecta. The latter is assumed to be in the direction of the asteroid surface normal \nat the location of the impact with a magnitude that scales with the momentum enhancement factor $\\beta$. \nWhen $\\beta=1$, neither the impactor nor any ejecta escape and only the momentum of the impactor is transferred to the asteroid. \nIn case ejecta are produced that are fast enough to escape the asteroid's gravitational well, laboratory experiments and simulations suggest,\nthat $\\beta$ may be substantially larger depending on the impact as well as the regolith, surface and subsurface properties of the target \n\\citep{jutzi-michel-2014,holsapple-housen-2012}. \nSome of those material properties were not acquired during the Hayabusa mission \\citep{hayabusa-2006} to (25143) Itokawa, the primary NEOT$\\omega$IST target, \nand it is very difficult to gather such data from ground-based observations. \nHence, our estimates of $\\beta$ will contain a significant amount of uncertainty. \nIn fact, all quantities in equation (\\ref{eq:dv}) have uncertainties associated with them. The precision of the \nmass of (25143) Itokawa, for instance, is not better than 3-5\\% \\citep{fujiwara2006rubble,abe2006mass}.\nUncertainties in the asteroid's velocity, $\\vec V$ come form the asteroid's orbit uncertainty at the time of the impact. \nEven the direction of the surface normal, $\\hat n$ at the location of the impact is difficult to predict, since limitations in guidance, \nnavigation and control (GNC) of the impactor\ncan only guarantee that the impactor hits the asteroid within a certain area ($25\\;$m $\\times$ $25\\;$m) rather than at a certain spot. As the surface normal orientation varies on\nsmaller length scales, the direction of the ejecta becomes uncertain; see Figure \\ref{fig:snorm}. \nThe uncertainties of surface normals in the GNC confidence area have to be taken into account as well to determine, \nfor instance, the optimum location for an impact that changes Itokawa's spin. They also add to the control uncertainty associated with a kinetic impact \\citep{scheeres-2015}.\nThe blue triangle and the green circle in Figure \\ref{fig:snorm} indicate the difference between impact locations when maximizing only the achievable torque based on the local surface normal\nat the impact point (green circle) or when maximizing the achievable torque whilst minimizing the surface normal variance (blue triangle).\nIn the latter case, a part of the achievable torque is sacrificed to limit uncertainties. For details see \\citet{neotwist-2015}. All of the uncertainties that have been described qualitatively in this section\nare relevant to assessing both, the probable change in Itokawa's spin state and its heliocentric orbit.\nIn the following section we aim to investigate the influence of those uncertainties on the future impact risk of (25143) Itokawa.\n\\begin{figure} \n\\begin{center}\n     {\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.6\\textwidth]{impact_eastern.pdf}} \\\\\n     {\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=1\\textwidth]{sn_y_zoom.pdf}}\\\\\n   \\caption{Map of (25143) Itokawa showing probable NEOT$\\omega$IST impact locations.\n   The preferred impact side (Eastern side) is presented on top.\n   A zoom on the area hosting the impact locations (yellow rectangle) is presented\n   below.\n   The normalized length of the impact-orthogonal components of the surface normal vectors is color coded.\n   Positive values point out of the image, negative values into the image.\n   The circle and the triangle symbols indicate the best impact locations with respect to optimum\n   torque and optimum torque with lowest surface normal variance. \n\\label{fig:snorm}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\\section{Post Mitigation Impact Risk Assessment}\\label{eggl:sec:pmira}\nThe goal of this section is to quantify probable uncertainties that occur in five NEOT$\\omega$IST mission scenarios\nfor the target asteroid (25143) Itokawa. Furthermore, we perform an impact risk re-assessment for Itokawa, taking the changes in the asteroid's orbit into account\nthat have been produced by the kinetic impact.\nThe five mission scenarios under investigation are summarized in Table \\ref{tab:0}. Our post mitigation impact risk assessment (PMIRA)\ntakes the following uncertainties into account: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Itokawa's mass and orbit uncertainties at the time of the impact,\n\\item variations in the topography of the impact area,\n\\item as well as the impactor mass uncertainty that is due to possible malfunctions of the release\nmechanisms of the flyby vehicle or cube-sat chasers.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe PMIRA process is then performed as follows:  \nFirst, uncertainties relevant to the change of the heliocentric orbit of (25143) Itokawa are quantified.\nThe resulting uncertainty domain is sampled through many possible realizations (clones) of the dynamical system \nafter the kinetic impact. All clones are propagated over a certain time span to check for possible impacts with the Earth.\nIf no impacts are detected, the statistical changes in the minimum encounter distance (MED) between the asteroid and the Earth are surveyed and discussed.\nThe relevant parameter ranges and uncertainties can be quantified as follows:\nItokawa's mass range is $3.51\\pm0.104 \\times 10^{10}$ kg \\citep{fujiwara2006rubble}.\nThe impactor is assumed to have masses between 520 kg and 640 kg (nominal 520 kg) depending on whether or not all observational equipment\nthat is to be launched prior to the impact is released correctly.\nEquation (\\ref{eq:dv}) dictates that both, magnitude and direction of the impactor, as well as of the ejecta have to be considered to correctly \ncalculate the change in the target asteroid's momentum.\nWhile the direction of the impactor was fixed according to the scenario specifications in Table \\ref{tab:0}, \nthe direction of the net ejecta momentum vector (EMV) was \ndrawn from a uniform distribution in a cone with an opening angle of $2\\phi=46$ deg around the local surface normal.\n\\footnote{Please note that this is not the opening angle\n of the ejecta plume, but the possible range of directions of the net ejecta momentum vector.} \nThe latter number was chosen \nin accordance with the variance of the surface normals close to the impactor target areas, see Figure \\ref{fig:snorm}. Thus, the uncertainty in the local\ntopography is accounted for.\nThe length of the net EMV was scaled to match an overall $\\beta$ factor range between 1.2 and 3.5 (nominal 2) \\citep{jutzi-michel-2014}.\nOrbital elements and their covariances, i.e., uncertainties for (25143) Itokawa, were taken from JPL's small body data base \\citep{chamberlin2010jpl}.\nThe combined covariance matrix of all uncertainties was sampled with a total number of 1000 clones per run along the largest Eigenvector of the covariance matrix\nbetween $\\pm3\\sigma$ \\citep[Extended Line of Variation, e.g.,][]{spoto-et-al-2014}. Orbit uncertainties were assumed to have Gaussian probability densities,\nwhereas the mitigation relevant parameters were drawn from uniform distributions \\citep{eggl-et-al-2015}. \nAn overall mission failure probability of 10\\% was assumed.\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{l|ccccc}\n\\hline\n scenario & S1 & S2 & S3 & S4 & S5\\\\\\hline\n year of arrival & 2024 & 2027 & 2030 & 2033  & 2036  \\\\\\hline\nswingbys & - & - & - & - & Earth                           \\\\\\hline\nflight time (days) & 581 & 942 & 589 & 95 & 503 \\\\\\hline\n Earth $v_{\\infty}$ (km/s) &\n 2.07 &\n 2.39 &\n 2.77 &\n 2.18 &\n 1.62 \\\\\\hline\n Earth $v_\\infty$ declination (deg) &\n 0.1 &\n 0.3 &\n 2.7 &\n 4.7 &\n -5.0 \\\\\\hline\narrival $v_\\infty$ perpendicular to Itokawa axis (km/s) &\n 7.99 &\n 8.45 &\n 8.86 &\n 8.97 &\n 8.92 \\\\\\hline\narrival $v_\\infty$ declin. w.r.t.

The subsequent calculations contained \nthe scenario-derived kinetic impact including all previously described uncertainties. \nAll cases were propagated up through January $1^{st}$, 2105. The corresponding dynamical model included the planets of the Solar system,\nthe Earth-moon, the Pluto-Charon system as well as the BIG16, i.e., the 16 most relevant perturbing asteroids as listed in the JPL-HORIZONS system \\citep[e.g.][]{horizons-2015}.\nPost-Newtonian corrections were incorporated as discussed in \\citet{eggl-et-al-2015}.\nOur results are presented in Figure \\ref{fig:cpd} as well as in Table \\ref{tab:1}.\nOne can see that none of these scenarios are capable of increasing the Earth-to-Itokawa miss distance for all future close encounters. \nScenarios 1, 2 and 3 are, nevertheless, acceptable from a planetary safety perspective as they increase the (global) MED between Itokawa and the Earth, i.e., the MED during the closest approach in the year 2071. \nIn contrast, the distance between Itokawa and the Earth would most likely shrink, if Scenarios 4 or 5 were chosen. \nThe kinetic impact-induced changes in the MED in both cases are of the order of a hundred kilometers\nduring the close encounter in 2071. As the actual distance between Itokawa and the Earth at that time is more than 10 LD, \nthe corresponding Palermo Scale values remain negligibly small.\nScenario 1 would result in the largest increase of the minimum encounter distance between Itokawa and the Earth, while Scenario 5 yields the largest decrease.\n\n\n\\section{Summary and Conclusions}\nIn this work we have investigated the role of uncertainties in the NEOT$\\omega$IST asteroid deflection demonstration concept.\nIn order to predict changes in the target asteroid's orbit and spin state, uncertainties had to be taken into account. \nApplying a probabilistic approach we have simulated the outcome of five different NEOT$\\omega$IST mission scenarios with the aim to see whether the change in the target\nasteroid's heliocentric orbit\n--- a byproduct of the change of the spin state --- yields an increased risk of collision between (25143) Itokawa and Earth during a future encounter. \nNone of the five NEOT$\\omega$IST mission designs proposed in this article would threaten planetary safety if implemented.  \nEarly launch and impact scenarios (S1-S3) even offer the possibility to enlarge \nthe close approach distance between Itokawa and Earth slightly in 2071.\n\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Acknowledgments}\\\\\nThis research has received funding from the\nEuropean Union's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under grant\nagreement no. 282703 (NEOShield) and H2020-PROTEC-2014 - Protection of European assets in\nand from space project no. 640351 (NEOShield-2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{17}\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname natexlab\\endcsname\\relax\\def\\natexlab#1{#1}\\fi\n\n\\bibitem[{Abe {et~al.}(2006)Abe, Mukai, Hirata, Barnouin-Jha, Cheng, Demura,\n  Gaskell, Hashimoto, Hiraoka, Honda, {et~al.}}]{abe2006mass}\nAbe, S. {et~al.} 2006, \\textit{Science}, 312, 1344\n\n\\bibitem[{Chamberlin \\& Yeomans(2010)}]{chamberlin2010jpl}\nChamberlin, A., \\& Yeomans, D. 2010, Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Solar System\n  Dynamics. http://ssd. jpl. nasa. gov\n\n\\bibitem[{{Cheng} {et~al.}(2012){Cheng}, {Rivkin}, {Galvez}, {Carnelli},\n  {Michel}, \\& {Reed}}]{aida-2012}\n{Cheng}, A.~F., {Rivkin}, A., {Galvez}, A., {Carnelli}, I., {Michel}, P., \\&\n  {Reed}, C. 2012, in AAS/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts,\n  Vol.~44, AAS/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts, 215.03\n\n\\bibitem[{{Drube} {et~al.}(2015){Drube}, {Harris}, {Engel}, {Falke}, {Johann},\n  {Eggl}, {Cano}, M., R., \\& P.}]{neotwist-2015}\n{Drube}, L. {et~al.} 2015, \\textit{AcA}, submitted\n\n\\bibitem[{Eggl {et~al.}(2015)Eggl, Hestroffer, Thuillot, Bancelin, Cano, \\&\n  Cichocki}]{eggl-et-al-2015}\nEggl, S., Hestroffer, D., Thuillot, W., Bancelin, D., Cano, J.~L., \\& Cichocki,\n  F. 2015, \\textit{Adv.

Furthermore, the here proposed\nkinetic impact scenarios can be implemented within the next two decades without threatening Earth's safety.\n \\keywords{minor planets, asteroids, celestial mechanics, space vehicles, methods: statistical}\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\firstsection \n              \n\\section{Introduction}\n\nNear-Earth objects (NEO) collide with our planet on a regular basis.   \nAlthough current NEO population and impact models suggest that such impacts are unlikely to cause \nglobal catastrophes in the near future \\citep{harris-2015}\nit is still reasonable to establish impact threat mitigation options. Even for sub-kilometer sized objects, \nthe potential loss of human life as well as the damage to local infrastructure and economy can more than justify an asteroid orbit deflection attempt.\nWhile many deflection options have been considered in the past, it has become more and more clear that the accurate assessment of \nan asteroid's physical and orbital parameters as well as their uncertainties is the key\ningredient to a successful impact threat mitigation, no matter which technique is chosen \\citep[][]{sugimoto-et-al-2014}.\nCurrent model predictions are deemed to be sufficiently close to reality to allow for a successful mitigation mission planning. Yet, \nonly a practical implementation of a deflection demonstration mission can confirm this belief.\nSeveral innovative asteroid deflection demonstration concepts have, therefore, been presented to space agencies \\cite[e.g.][]{donquijote-2006,aida-2012,arm-2014}.\n\n\\section{NEOT$\\omega$IST}\nThe NEOShield consortium \\citep{harris-et-al-2013} has recently explored low cost deflection demo mission options capable of delivering a reasonable amount of \ndata for model validation at\nminimum expense. Core to the resulting NEOT$\\omega$IST concept \\citep{neotwist-2015} is the idea \nto use an off-center kinetic impact to change the spin state of an already well known NEO such as (25143) Itokawa. The main advantage\nof this approach lies in the fact that sending an expensive second spacecraft on a rendez-vous trajectory to characterize the target and observe the impact \ncan be avoided. \nIn fact, short term information such as the ejecta distribution produced by the impact can be observed \nby a fly-by vehicle and/or chasers that decouple from the impactor some time before the collision.\nLong term changes in the rotation state caused by the kinetic impact can be reconstructed via ground based observations and \nlinked with mitigation parameters to a reasonable degree of accuracy, depending, of course, on the remaining uncertainties in the target's physical parameters.\nConservative estimates predict a delivered impact momentum of roughly $5\\times 10^3$ kNs resulting in a change in Itokawa's rotational period of approximately 4 minutes ($\\approx0.5\\%$). This change is large enough to be validated with a reasonably high `signal-to-noise ratio` (SNR $>10$) within the first year after the impact using ground based\nobservations alone \\citep{neotwist-2015}. However, uncertainties in the targets' physical properties and the impact delivery remain non-negligible, even for a well characterized\ntarget such as (25143) Itokawa.\nA conscientious evaluation of uncertainties and their consequences on the deflection mission outcome is, thus, vital, as it directly influences our\nability to derive relevant parameters from observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{The role of uncertainties in deflection demonstration missions}\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if it were possible to send explorer spacecraft as part of every deflection mission or deflection mission demonstration, our knowledge of key parameters\nsuch as the asteroid's mass and subsurface structure would never be perfect. This may not be particularly problematic,\nas the remaining uncertainties simply need to be accounted for in the deflection planning. \nDepending on the available warning time and resources devoted to an actual deflection attempt, relatively large uncertainties can \nbe acceptable as long as deflection success, i.e., a minimum miss distance with respect to the Earth, is guaranteed \\citep{sugimoto-et-al-2014}.\nHow about asteroid deflection demonstration missions? \nFor one, uncertainties need to be quantified and, if possible, constrained in order to guarantee a validation of the effect. \nIn other words, uncertainties in the target's observables must not be larger than\nthe change imparted by the demonstration mission. \nIf one attempts to derive deflection parameters such as the momentum enhancement factor, $\\beta$ \\citep{holsapple-housen-2012}, \nfrom the effective change of a demo mission target's spin state, for instance,\nachieving a high SNR between the difference in rotation periods and its uncertainty becomes a necessity. \nA study of uncertainties regarding the impact delivery, Itokawa's topography, and \nthe location of its spin axis and consequently its moments of inertia shows that \na NEOT$\\omega$IST concept realization should permit to measure $\\beta$ with a relative precision better than $\\sigma_{\\beta}/\\beta \\approx 0.3$ \nusing ground based observations alone. For more details on this topic we would like to refer the reader to \\cite{neotwist-2015}.\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from impact validation and parameter estimation, \nuncertainties also play a fundamental role in post mitigation impact risk assessment (PMIRA) \\citep{eggl-et-al-2015}. \nChanges in the target's orbit caused by the deflection demonstration are not supposed to increase the impact probability with respect to the Earth \nin the foreseeable future. If a deflection demonstration mission is subject to large uncertainties,  \na risk analysis has to be performed in order to dispel planetary safety concerns. \nOf course, the primary goal of the NEOT$\\omega$IST concept is to change the spin state of the target asteroid.\nHowever, an off-center impact will alter the target's heliocentric orbit as well. \nIn order to discuss the relevant uncertainties for a kinetic impactor-based mission such as  NEOT$\\omega$IST,   \nand to see how these may affect the target's heliocentric orbit, let us briefly recall the following equation \\citep{scheeres-2015}:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta \\vec V\\approx \\frac{m}{M}[\\mathcal I+(\\beta-1)\\hat n \\hat n] \\Delta \\vec v    \\label{eq:dv},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta\\vec{V}\\approx\\frac{m}{M}[\\mathcal{I}+(\\beta-1)\\hat{n}\\hat{n}]\\Delta\\vec%&#10;{v},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow><mo>\u2248</mo><mrow><mfrac><mi>m</mi><mi>M</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2110</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u2192</mo></mover></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
