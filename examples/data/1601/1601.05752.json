Contrary to the classical ferro- and antiferromagnets the ground state of ChM is an incommensurate homochiral spin spiral -- the  spiral with an unique sense of magnetization rotation, see figure~\\ref{Intro}(a). \n\nThe interaction which is responsible for the stabilization of such spin spirals is an antisymmetric exchange, also known as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)\\cite{Dzyaloshinskii, Moriya}, which appears in crystals with  broken inversion symmetry.\n\nFor instance, to this class of magnetic materials belong different Si- and Ge-based alloys such as MnSi \\cite{Yu_15} and FeGe \\cite{Yu_11}, Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge \\cite{Shibata_13},  Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si \\cite{Yokouchi_14}, Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si \\cite{Yu_10}.\n\nSuch alloys with B20 crystal symmetry can be referred to as the distinct class of so-called isotropic ChM (IChM). Such a classification reflects the dominant role of DMI and Heisenberg exchange, which are assumed to be isotropic in all spatial directions, while in the frame of the basic model, the contribution of magnetocrystalline anisotropy can be neglected.\n\nThe special interest to such materials arose after the \nbreakthrough results on the direct observation of magnetic skyrmions in thin films of ChM \\cite{Yu_10}. \n\nThe experimental discovery of magnetic skyrmions together with the conceptual idea of a revolutionary new type of magnetic memory gave an additional impetus to the research in this field \\cite{Kiselev_11,Fert_13}.\n\nHere we present results of our theoretical calculations for the magnetic field induced transitions in thin films of IChM, which allowed us to identify the critical film thickness above which the skyrmions never appear as the ground state of the system.\n\nRealizing that even in the simplest one-dimensional (1D) model of ChM the ground state exhibits periodic modulations \\cite{helix}, in the three-dimensional (3D) systems one should expect the appearance and coexistence of complex inhomogeneous phases, which are of major interest for both fundamental research and  practical applications.\n\nIndeed, in this paper we identify an earlier unknown phase, that we term \\textit{stacked spin spirals phase} (StSS). The calculated phase diagram exhibits a wide range of existence of this new phase. \n\nThis new phase exhibits periodic modulations in all three spatial directions and can be considered as the coexistence of the conical phase and the complex spin spirals localized near the surfaces.\n\nWe found that such a state should appear in a wide range of film thicknesses as well as in the bulk samples.\n\nWe provide a comprehensive description of this phase together with our suggestions  how such a state can be experimentally detected.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth]{Fig1.pdf}\n\\caption{ \n\\textbf{Schematic representation of different modulated states in bulk and thin films of chiral magnets.} \n(a) Helical spin spiral at zero field with wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ pointing along the $z-$axis.\n(b) Conical state with inclined magnetization and wave vector along the  magnetic field.\n(c) Color sphere illustrating the notation for the component of the vector field used in all figures, here and below.\n(d)--(f) The vector field and cross sections of corresponding isosurfaces, $n_z=0$, for: skyrmion tube with homogeneous magnetization along the radial symmetry axis (d), for skyrmion tube in thin film of chiral magnet with inhomogeneous magnetization in all three spatial directions and the twist induced by the free surface (e), chiral bobbers --  hybrid particlelike states localized near the surface of the chiral magnet characterized by smooth magnetization distribution and presence of singularity -- chiral Bloch point at finite distance from the surface (f), for details see Ref.~\\cite{Rybakov_15}. Note, the section of the isosurfaces in (d)-(f) corresponds to $n_z>0$, $n_x<0$.\n}\n \\label{Intro}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the existence of the magnetic skyrmions in magnetic crystals with DMI has been theoretically predicted by Bogdanov in 1989 \\cite{Bogdanov_89}, but it took more then twenty years to discover them experimentally.\n\nOne of the reason behind is the modification of the conventional energy balance in thin films of ChMs in comparison to the bulk crystals.\n\nIndeed, according to the theory developed by Bogdanov and co-workers, see e.g. Ref.~\\cite{Bogdanov_14}, the chiral skyrmion tubes, see figure~\\ref{Intro}(d), in bulk crystals of ChMs with relatively weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy may appear only as a metastable state.\n\nTheir energy is always higher than the energy of the conical phase, figure~\\ref{Intro}(b), which dominates in bulk crystals almost in the whole range of magnetic fields and temperatures.\n\nThis result is consistent with many experimental studies on bulk ChM over the past decades, where skyrmions were not observed. \n\nThe only exception is the so-called A-phase -- the high-temperature region in the bulk phase diagram, just below the ordering temperature, where skyrmions has been proposed to exist due to thermal fluctuations \\cite{Muelbauer_09}.\n\nHowever, the real nature of the A-phase still is under debate \\cite{Muelbauer_09,Maleev, Wilhelm_11}.\n\nThe theoretical models predict that in bulk crystals of ChMs, the magnetic skyrmions can be stabilized due to the strong cubic or uniaxial anisotropy \\cite{Bogdanov_14,Bogdanov_08} or special crystal symmetry, which suppress the formation of the conical phase \\cite{Bogdanov_89,Bogdanov_94}.\n\nHowever, such theoretical models as well as thermal fluctuations can not be considered as the main mechanism for skyrmion stabilization in stand-alone thin films of B20-alloys where the skyrmions are observed in a wide range of temperatures, much lower than the ordering temperature.\n\nAs has been shown in Ref.~\\cite{Rybakov_13} the key to the understanding of the mechanism of skyrmion stabilization in thin films of ChM are presence of the free surfaces and the three-dimensional rather than the two-dimensional structure of the equilibrium skyrmions.\n\nAs shown in figure~\\ref{Intro}(e), the solution for the skyrmion tube in a thin film is characterized by the twist of magnetization with respect to the normal vector of the film surfaces.\n\nOne can compare the twisted iso-surface of the skyrmion tube in figure~\\ref{Intro}(e) and the homogeneous non-twisted skyrmion tube in (d). \n\nThe magnetic moments in the top surface layer are slightly turned towards the center of the skyrmion, while in the bottom of the film they are slightly turned outwards the center.\n\nThe spin structure on the top and bottom surfaces corresponds to a certain intermediate configuration in between of pure Bloch- and Neel-type of skyrmions. \n\nSuch surface induced twist propagates from one surface to another through the whole film.\n\nNote, it mainly affects the magnetic spins near the surfaces where spins are weakly coupled to each other because of reduced number of neighbors at the free surface.\n\nFar from the film surface, the spin structure of such a 3D skyrmion remains almost the same as in a homogeneous skyrmion tube.\n\nThe energy gain by the DMI contribution accumulated along the film thickness reduces the total energy of the state such that within a certain range of magnetic fields and film thicknesses the skyrmion tube becomes energetically more favorable than the conical phase.\n\nMoreover, it has been shown earlier that the same effect is responsible for the stability of chiral bobber -- particlelike objects localized in all three spatial directions near the surface of the chiral magnet \\cite{Rybakov_15}, see figure~\\ref{Intro}(f).\n\nNote, because of the presence of a singularity, the chiral Bloch point, at low temperatures the chiral bobbers  appear exclusively as a metastable state. \n\nIt is obvious that for very thick films, the relative energy contribution of the surface twist becomes very small, while the main contribution to the energy of skyrmion comes from the volume part of the film. \n\nThereby, there should be a critical thickness above which the energy gain of the surface twist is not anymore sufficient to provide enough energy gain to stabilize a skyrmion lattice.\n\nIn order to identify the range of thicknesses and magnetic fields defining the range of stability for the skyrmion lattice and other states, we have calculated a phase diagram  for the film of isotropic ChM in a wide range of thicknesses and applied magnetic fields, which is presented in section~\\ref{PphaseDiargam}.  \n\n\n\\section{Model}\\label{model}\nThe basic model for IChM include three main energy terms: the Heisenberg exchange interaction, the

They can be measured experimentally, which allows to rescale the phase diagram, figure~\\ref{PD}(a), in real units of film thickness, $L$ and magnetic field $H$. \n\nThe solid lines in figure~\\ref{PD}(a)  correspond to the first-order phase transitions between helical spin spiral (red), skyrmion lattice (grey), conical phase (white) and new up-to-now unknown phase, which we call \\textit{stacked spin-spirals state} (yellow) and is discussed in detail in  section~\\ref{StSS}.\n\nThe horizontal dashed line indicates the second order phase transition between conical and saturated ferromagnetic state (blue).          \n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth]{Fig2.pdf}\n\\caption{ \n\\textbf{The phase diagram of magnetic states in film of isotropic chiral magnet.}\n(a) The phase diagram of magnetic states in reduced units of film thicknesses $L$ and magnetic field $H$ applied normally to the film surface.\nThe central panel corresponds to the reduced film thickness varied between 0 and  $L=50L_\\mathrm{D}$ ($L_\\mathrm{D}$ is the period of helicoid at $H$=0).

An attempt to generalize such a phase diagram for a wider range of thicknesses, $1\\!\\!\\le \\!\\!L/L_\\mathrm{D}\\!\\! < \\!\\! \\infty$, had been announced recently \\cite{Leonov_15arXiv}.  \n\nThe phase diagram presented in Ref.~\\cite{Leonov_15arXiv} contains four distinct states and one triple-point.\n\nWe have tested these data and got qualitatively and quantitatively different results.\n\nThe phase diagram presented in this contribution contains five distinct states and two triple points.\n\nThe triple point $I$ defines the critical thickness of the film, $L^*=8.17 L_\\mathrm{D}$, above which the skyrmions may exist only as a metastable state. For instance, for MnSi ($L_\\mathrm{D}=18$ nm) and FeGe ($L_\\mathrm{D}=70$ nm) it gives $L^*_\\mathrm{MnSi}\\approx150$~nm and $L^*_\\mathrm{FeGe}\\approx570$~nm.\n\nWith decreasing thickness the range of existence for the skyrmion lattice in an fapplied magnetic field becomes wider.\n\nThis fact reflects the relative contribution of the surface induced twists, which increases with decreasing thickness.\n\nThere is another critical point, for $L/L_\\mathrm{D}<0.68$, the conical phase is totally suppressed and becomes energetically unfavorable in the whole range of fields. \n\nIt is important to mention that the chiral surface twist discussed above also introduces an additional modulation in the helical spiral state.\n\nNote, the $\\mathbf{k}$-vector of such helical spiral lies in the plane of the film, orthogonal to the applied field.\n\nThe surface induced modulation reduces the energy of the helix and in a certain range of fields makes it energetically more favorable than the conical state.\n\nSuch a behavior of the system is totally different to the one of the bulk crystals, where theoretically any infinitesimal magnetic field leads to convergence of the helix to the conical phase or more precisely to the StSS according to results presented here, see right panel in figure~\\ref{PD}(a). \n\nFinally, we have to emphasize that the effect of the chiral surface twist is not restricted to the film surfaces, but also appears on the side edges of the sample.\n\nThe presence of the edge twist effect has been reported earlier in Ref.~\\cite{Surf_twist1} and  has been confirmed recently by directly observation with the Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) \\cite{Du_15}. \n  \nIt is worth to emphasize that, the continuum 3D model of IChM strictly speaking does not converge to a simple 2D model even in the limiting case of $L/L_\\mathrm{D}\\rightarrow0$.\n\nIn order to illustrate such a discrepancy we added the left panel in figure~\\ref{PD}(a), which corresponds to the phase diagram of 2D IChM valid for the single isotropic monolayer or multilayer with interface induced DMI and for ChM of particular crystal symmetry e.g.\\ $C_{nv}$, $D_{2d}$ and $S_4$ \\cite{Bogdanov_89,Bogdanov_94}. \n\n\\subsection{Stacked spin spirals}\\label{StSS}\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth]{Fig3.pdf}\n\\caption{ \n\\textbf{Stacked spirals states.}\nMagnetization distribution in  films of chiral magnets with the local magnetization direction as indicated by the colors according to the code in figure~\\ref{Intro}(c). \n\n(a)--(c) The magnetization distributions for the stacked spin spirals in the film with the thickness of $L=4L_\\mathrm{D}$.\n$\\textbf{k}_\\mathrm{c}$ indicates the propagation direction of the conical spiral in the bulk of the film, while $\\textbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\textbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$ indicate the propagation directions of the complex spin spirals on the top and bottom surfaces, respectively.

It exhibits a mixed helical- and cycloidal-like modulation as shown in figure~\\ref{Twist-surface}(a).\n\nThe clock-wise rotation of magnetization in the helical-like part is chosen as direction of the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ for such a complex spin spiral, see figure~\\ref{Twist-surface}(c).\n\nWe found that the relative orientation of the propagation vectors of the spin spirals on the top and bottom surfaces, $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$, respectively, is thickness dependent.\n\nIn other words, the angle $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}$ between $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$ for the equilibrium StSS varies as function of the film thickness.\n\nIn particular, under the condition $L=(n+\\frac12)L_\\mathrm{D}$, where $n$ is an integer number, the equilibrium $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=0$ and gradually varies with the thickness: for $L=(n+\\frac34)L_\\mathrm{D}$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=90^{\\circ}$, for $L=(n+1)L_\\mathrm{D}$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=180^{\\circ}$, and for $L=(n+1\\frac14)L_\\mathrm{D}$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=90^{\\circ}$.\n\nFigure~\\ref{Twist}(a) illustrates the case of $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=180^{\\circ}$, $L=4L_\\mathrm{D}$, while (d) illustrates the case of $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=90^{\\circ}$, $L=4\\frac14 L_\\mathrm{D}$.\n\nNote, because of the relatively weak energy dependence upon the $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}$ in the case of thick films, one should expect a significant influence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy to the orientation of the vectors $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$ with respect to certain crystallographic directions.\n\nThe modulation of the out-of-plane component of the magnetization of the surface spin spiral should lead to  appearances of the stray fields above the sample, which in turn can be detected by Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) in films as well as in bulk crystals. \n\nHowever, with ordinary MFM technique it seems to be hard to distinguish the StSS from the ordinary helical state, which also produces a stray field around the sample.\n\nMoreover, MFM is not able to detect the relative orientation of the surface spin spirals on the opposite surfaces which is desired for experimental revealing of the result of our theoretical calculations.\n\nThe most promising experimental technique, which may allow to detect the StSS seems to be Lorentz TEM. \n\nNote, typically the Lorentz TEM images provide  information only about the in-plain component of the  magnetization. \nFigure~\\ref{TwistAv} shows the in-plane component of the magnetization averaged over the film thickness. Two cases with stripe- and square-like pattern presented in figure~\\ref{TwistAv}(a) and (c) corresponds to the spin structure shown in figure~\\ref{Twist}(a) and (d), respectively. \n   \n  \n\\section{Method}\\label{method}\nTo construct the phase diagram shown in figure~\\ref{PD}(a), we performed an energy minimization for each of the states and compared their energy density, see for instance figure~\\ref{PD}(b). \n\nA finite difference approximation was used to convert the Hamiltonian (\\ref{E_tot_m}) into a function, which arguments are  the components of unit vectors defined on the nodes of finite size grid with unit cell size $\\Delta x\\times\\Delta y\\times \\Delta z$. \n\nSuch calculations have been done for certain set of reduced thicknesses, $L/L_\\mathrm{D}$, defined by the geometry of the simulated domain, material parameters and applied fields varying in the range $0\\le H/H_\\mathrm{D} \\le 1.5$.\n\nFor the function minimization we use a nonlinear conjugate gradient method implemented on NVIDIA CUDA architecture.\n\nIn order to achieve the highest performance of the code and to keep the constraint $\\mathbf{n}^2=1$, we use the method of adaptive stereographic projections introduced in Ref.~\\cite{Rybakov_15}.\n\nThe size of the simulated domain along each of the spatial directions is defined as $l_x=N_x \\Delta x$, $l_y=N_y \\Delta y$, $l_z=(N_z - 1)\\Delta z$, where $N_x$, $N_y$ and $N_z$ are the number of nodes fixed to 128, 256 and 256$...$512, respectively (up to $16\\times 10^{6}$ nodes in total).\n\nFor the fixed thickness, $L$, the value of $\\Delta z$ is chosen such to satisfy the equality $L=(N_z-1) \\Delta z$,\nwhile $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are defined self-consistently to identify such $l_x$ and $l_y$, which correspond to the lowest average energy density of the state.\n\nWe assume periodic boundary conditions in the $xy$-plane and open boundary conditions along $z$-axis at $z=0$ and $z=L$.\n\nThereby, the procedure of energy minimization for each point on the phase diagram and for each of the states consist of an \\textit{a priori} unknown number of alternating steps: i) the direct energy

assumed to be independent.\n\nIn particular, it is important for the proper energy minimization of StSS state, which is in general characterized by the modulations in both $x$- and $y$-directions, see figure~\\ref{Twist}. \n\nFor the case of helical spin spiral and assuming $\\mathbf{k}\\parallel x$-axis, the optimal $\\Delta x$ minimizes the energy of the system when $l_x$ equals to the equilibrium period of the helix.\nBecause of the homogeneity of the helical state in the direction perpendicular to $\\mathbf{k}$-vector,  the variation in $\\Delta y$ does not affect the energy density of the solution at all, and the problem reduces to a quasi-two-dimensional one.\n\nThe procedure based on direct minimization of the functional discussed above had been applied for relatively thin films, $L\\le 4L_\\mathrm{D}$. \n\nFor the thick films, we take into account the exponential decay of surface induced modulation \\cite{Surf_twist1}, which becomes negligibly small on the

They can be measured experimentally, which allows to rescale the phase diagram, figure~\\ref{PD}(a), in real units of film thickness, $L$ and magnetic field $H$. \n\nThe solid lines in figure~\\ref{PD}(a)  correspond to the first-order phase transitions between helical spin spiral (red), skyrmion lattice (grey), conical phase (white) and new up-to-now unknown phase, which we call \\textit{stacked spin-spirals state} (yellow) and is discussed in detail in  section~\\ref{StSS}.\n\nThe horizontal dashed line indicates the second order phase transition between conical and saturated ferromagnetic state (blue).          \n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth]{Fig2.pdf}\n\\caption{ \n\\textbf{The phase diagram of magnetic states in film of isotropic chiral magnet.}\n(a) The phase diagram of magnetic states in reduced units of film thicknesses $L$ and magnetic field $H$ applied normally to the film surface.\nThe central panel corresponds to the reduced film thickness varied between 0 and  $L=50L_\\mathrm{D}$ ($L_\\mathrm{D}$ is the period of helicoid at $H$=0).

An attempt to generalize such a phase diagram for a wider range of thicknesses, $1\\!\\!\\le \\!\\!L/L_\\mathrm{D}\\!\\! < \\!\\! \\infty$, had been announced recently \\cite{Leonov_15arXiv}.  \n\nThe phase diagram presented in Ref.~\\cite{Leonov_15arXiv} contains four distinct states and one triple-point.\n\nWe have tested these data and got qualitatively and quantitatively different results.\n\nThe phase diagram presented in this contribution contains five distinct states and two triple points.\n\nThe triple point $I$ defines the critical thickness of the film, $L^*=8.17 L_\\mathrm{D}$, above which the skyrmions may exist only as a metastable state. For instance, for MnSi ($L_\\mathrm{D}=18$ nm) and FeGe ($L_\\mathrm{D}=70$ nm) it gives $L^*_\\mathrm{MnSi}\\approx150$~nm and $L^*_\\mathrm{FeGe}\\approx570$~nm.\n\nWith decreasing thickness the range of existence for the skyrmion lattice in an fapplied magnetic field becomes wider.\n\nThis fact reflects the relative contribution of the surface induced twists, which increases with decreasing thickness.\n\nThere is another critical point, for $L/L_\\mathrm{D}<0.68$, the conical phase is totally suppressed and becomes energetically unfavorable in the whole range of fields. \n\nIt is important to mention that the chiral surface twist discussed above also introduces an additional modulation in the helical spiral state.\n\nNote, the $\\mathbf{k}$-vector of such helical spiral lies in the plane of the film, orthogonal to the applied field.\n\nThe surface induced modulation reduces the energy of the helix and in a certain range of fields makes it energetically more favorable than the conical state.\n\nSuch a behavior of the system is totally different to the one of the bulk crystals, where theoretically any infinitesimal magnetic field leads to convergence of the helix to the conical phase or more precisely to the StSS according to results presented here, see right panel in figure~\\ref{PD}(a). \n\nFinally, we have to emphasize that the effect of the chiral surface twist is not restricted to the film surfaces, but also appears on the side edges of the sample.\n\nThe presence of the edge twist effect has been reported earlier in Ref.~\\cite{Surf_twist1} and  has been confirmed recently by directly observation with the Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) \\cite{Du_15}. \n  \nIt is worth to emphasize that, the continuum 3D model of IChM strictly speaking does not converge to a simple 2D model even in the limiting case of $L/L_\\mathrm{D}\\rightarrow0$.\n\nIn order to illustrate such a discrepancy we added the left panel in figure~\\ref{PD}(a), which corresponds to the phase diagram of 2D IChM valid for the single isotropic monolayer or multilayer with interface induced DMI and for ChM of particular crystal symmetry e.g.\\ $C_{nv}$, $D_{2d}$ and $S_4$ \\cite{Bogdanov_89,Bogdanov_94}. \n\n\\subsection{Stacked spin spirals}\\label{StSS}\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth]{Fig3.pdf}\n\\caption{ \n\\textbf{Stacked spirals states.}\nMagnetization distribution in  films of chiral magnets with the local magnetization direction as indicated by the colors according to the code in figure~\\ref{Intro}(c). \n\n(a)--(c) The magnetization distributions for the stacked spin spirals in the film with the thickness of $L=4L_\\mathrm{D}$.\n$\\textbf{k}_\\mathrm{c}$ indicates the propagation direction of the conical spiral in the bulk of the film, while $\\textbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\textbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$ indicate the propagation directions of the complex spin spirals on the top and bottom surfaces, respectively.

It exhibits a mixed helical- and cycloidal-like modulation as shown in figure~\\ref{Twist-surface}(a).\n\nThe clock-wise rotation of magnetization in the helical-like part is chosen as direction of the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ for such a complex spin spiral, see figure~\\ref{Twist-surface}(c).\n\nWe found that the relative orientation of the propagation vectors of the spin spirals on the top and bottom surfaces, $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$, respectively, is thickness dependent.\n\nIn other words, the angle $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}$ between $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$ for the equilibrium StSS varies as function of the film thickness.\n\nIn particular, under the condition $L=(n+\\frac12)L_\\mathrm{D}$, where $n$ is an integer number, the equilibrium $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=0$ and gradually varies with the thickness: for $L=(n+\\frac34)L_\\mathrm{D}$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=90^{\\circ}$, for $L=(n+1)L_\\mathrm{D}$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=180^{\\circ}$, and for $L=(n+1\\frac14)L_\\mathrm{D}$, $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=90^{\\circ}$.\n\nFigure~\\ref{Twist}(a) illustrates the case of $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=180^{\\circ}$, $L=4L_\\mathrm{D}$, while (d) illustrates the case of $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}=90^{\\circ}$, $L=4\\frac14 L_\\mathrm{D}$.\n\nNote, because of the relatively weak energy dependence upon the $\\beta_\\mathrm{tb}$ in the case of thick films, one should expect a significant influence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy to the orientation of the vectors $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{t}$ and $\\mathbf{k}_\\mathrm{b}$ with respect to certain crystallographic directions.\n\nThe modulation of the out-of-plane component of the magnetization of the surface spin spiral should lead to  appearances of the stray fields above the sample, which in turn can be detected by Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) in films as well as in bulk crystals. \n\nHowever, with ordinary MFM technique it seems to be hard to distinguish the StSS from the ordinary helical state, which also produces a stray field around the sample.\n\nMoreover, MFM is not able to detect the relative orientation of the surface spin spirals on the opposite surfaces which is desired for experimental revealing of the result of our theoretical calculations.\n\nThe most promising experimental technique, which may allow to detect the StSS seems to be Lorentz TEM. \n\nNote, typically the Lorentz TEM images provide  information only about the in-plain component of the  magnetization. \nFigure~\\ref{TwistAv} shows the in-plane component of the magnetization averaged over the film thickness. Two cases with stripe- and square-like pattern presented in figure~\\ref{TwistAv}(a) and (c) corresponds to the spin structure shown in figure~\\ref{Twist}(a) and (d), respectively. \n   \n  \n\\section{Method}\\label{method}\nTo construct the phase diagram shown in figure~\\ref{PD}(a), we performed an energy minimization for each of the states and compared their energy density, see for instance figure~\\ref{PD}(b). \n\nA finite difference approximation was used to convert the Hamiltonian (\\ref{E_tot_m}) into a function, which arguments are  the components of unit vectors defined on the nodes of finite size grid with unit cell size $\\Delta x\\times\\Delta y\\times \\Delta z$. \n\nSuch calculations have been done for certain set of reduced thicknesses, $L/L_\\mathrm{D}$, defined by the geometry of the simulated domain, material parameters and applied fields varying in the range $0\\le H/H_\\mathrm{D} \\le 1.5$.\n\nFor the function minimization we use a nonlinear conjugate gradient method implemented on NVIDIA CUDA architecture.\n\nIn order to achieve the highest performance of the code and to keep the constraint $\\mathbf{n}^2=1$, we use the method of adaptive stereographic projections introduced in Ref.~\\cite{Rybakov_15}.\n\nThe size of the simulated domain along each of the spatial directions is defined as $l_x=N_x \\Delta x$, $l_y=N_y \\Delta y$, $l_z=(N_z - 1)\\Delta z$, where $N_x$, $N_y$ and $N_z$ are the number of nodes fixed to 128, 256 and 256$...$512, respectively (up to $16\\times 10^{6}$ nodes in total).\n\nFor the fixed thickness, $L$, the value of $\\Delta z$ is chosen such to satisfy the equality $L=(N_z-1) \\Delta z$,\nwhile $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ are defined self-consistently to identify such $l_x$ and $l_y$, which correspond to the lowest average energy density of the state.\n\nWe assume periodic boundary conditions in the $xy$-plane and open boundary conditions along $z$-axis at $z=0$ and $z=L$.\n\nThereby, the procedure of energy minimization for each point on the phase diagram and for each of the states consist of an \\textit{a priori} unknown number of alternating steps: i) the direct energy minimization for given $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, $\\Delta z$ and ii) the small variation of $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$. \n\nIn most general case, the variation of $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ is assumed to be independent.\n\nIn particular, it is important for the proper energy minimization of StSS state, which is in general characterized by the modulations in both $x$- and $y$-directions, see figure~\\ref{Twist}. \n\nFor the case of helical spin spiral and assuming $\\mathbf{k}\\parallel x$-axis, the optimal $\\Delta x$ minimizes the energy of the system when $l_x$ equals to the equilibrium period of the helix.\nBecause of the homogeneity of the helical state in the direction perpendicular to $\\mathbf{k}$-vector,  the variation in $\\Delta y$ does not affect the energy density of the solution at all, and the problem reduces to a quasi-two-dimensional one.\n\nThe procedure based on direct minimization of the functional discussed above had been applied for relatively thin films, $L\\le 4L_\\mathrm{D}$. \n\nFor the thick films, we take into account the exponential decay of surface induced modulation \\cite{Surf_twist1}, which becomes negligibly small on the distance from the surface $ > \\!L_\\mathrm{D}$.\n\nThereby, the average energy density of any modulated state in the extended (infinite along the $x$- and $y$-directions) thick film with $L>4L_\\mathrm{D}$ with a very high precision can be approximated as\n\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ne(H,L) \\!= e_\\mathrm{v}(H)+\\frac{2e_\\mathrm{s}(H)}{L}, \n\\label{thick-film}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"e(H,L)\\!=e_{\\mathrm{v}}(H)+\\frac{2e_{\\mathrm{s}}(H)}{L},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>L</mi><mo rspace=\"0.8pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">v</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mi>L</mi></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
