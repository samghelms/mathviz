They found that the ellipticity of\nthe red globular cluster systems (GCSs) follows much more tightly than that of the stellar light, compared with the ellipticity of the blue GCSs. \nFrom this and other related properties of the GCSs they suggested that massive ETGs may have dual halos: a blue (metal-poor) halo\nand a red (metal-rich) halo. The red halos are much more elongated and centrally concentrated than the blue halos. The red halos may have stronger rotation than the blue halos. They predicted that ETGs may host stellar halos corresponding to these two halos. However, the number density of the blue halo stars in ETGs is much lower than that of the red halo stars in the outer region of their host galaxies so that it is not easy to see the blue halo stars in typical images of ETGs. Typical images of ETGs show only the structure of the red halos that dominate the integrated light. \n\nIndeed the existence of blue (metal-poor) RGB stars in ETGs was studied for a few nearby galaxies: NGC 3115 (S0), NGC 5128 (Ep), NGC 3377 (E5), and M105 (NGC 3379, E1) \\citep{els97,har02,rej05, rej11,crn13,har07a,har07b,bir15,pea15}. \nIn her pioneering study of stars in an $HST$/WFPC2 field $5\\arcmin$ (22 kpc) away from the major axis of NGC 3115, an edge-on bright S0 galaxy, \\citet{els97} found that the $(V-I)$ color distribution\nof the resolved red giants in this field shows a clear bimodality. Then she pointed out that there are two distinct halo\npopulations of roughly equal size: a metal-poor halo with [Fe/H] $\\approx -1.3$ and a metal-rich one with [Fe/H] $\\approx -0.0$. This bimodality was confirmed later in a recent study of the resolved stars in the more remote fields of this galaxy based on deeper photometry by \\citet{pea15}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{lcl}\n\\tablewidth{0pc} \n\\tablecaption{Basic Parameters of M105\\label{tab-info}}\n\\tablehead{\n\\colhead{Parameter} \t& \\colhead{Value} & \\colhead{References}}\n\\startdata\nR.A.(J2000), Dec(J2000) \t& 10 47 49.6,  +12 34 54\t& 1 \\\\\nMorphological Type \t\t\t\t\t& E1 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t& 2\\\\\nTotal magnitude and color  \t& $B^T = 10.24\\pm0.03$, $( B^T - V^T ) = 0.96\\pm0.01$ & 2\\\\\nEllipticity\t \t\t\t& 0.11 & 3\\\\\n\nPosition angle \t\t\t& 71 deg & 3\\\\\n\n$D_{25}(B)$\t\t\t\t&  $262\\arcsec$ & 2\\\\ \n\n\n\nEffective radius\t\t& $58\\farcs7$ & 2 \\\\\n\nSystemic velocity \t\t& 911 km s$^{-1}$ & 1\\\\\n\n\nCentral velocity dispersion ($R_{\\rm eff}/8$) & $213 $ km s$^{-1}$ & 4 \\\\\nForeground reddening \t& \n$E(B-V)=0.022$ & 5 \\\\\nDistance \t\t\t\t& $(m-M)_0 = 30.05\\pm0.02({\\rm ran})\\pm0.12({\\rm sys})$ & 6 \\\\\nPlate scale \t\t\t\t& 49.6 pc arcsec$^{-1}$ & 6 \\\\\nAbsolute total magnitudes \t\t& $M_B^T = -19.89 $, $M_V^T = -20.83 $  & 6\\\\ \n\\enddata\n\n\\tablerefs{(1) NED; (2) \\citet{dev91}; (3) \\citet{mak14}; (4) \\citet{cap13}; (5) \\citet{sch11}; (6) This study.}\n\\label{tab_info}\n\\end{deluxetable*}\n\n\n\n\nResolved stars in NGC 5218 \nwere extensively studied by \\citet{har02,rej05, rej11, crn13, rej14} and \\citet{bir15}.\n\n\nBecause of the presence of notable dust lane in the middle, whether the morphological type of NGC 5128 is pecular S0 or E has been controversial. In a recent review, \\citet{har10} \nconcluded that it is an Ep, noting that its global properties are closer to normal Es, except for the dust lane. \n\nNGC 5128 covers a very large angular size in the sky so that deep images were obtained only for a part of the entire galaxy. \n\\citet{har07a} studied the resolved stars in NGC 3377, a highly elongated E5 galaxy\nwith intermediate luminosity ($M_V = -19.9$ mag), finding that the mean metallicity of these stars is between those of\nmassive galaxies and dwarf galaxies.\n \nIn this study we investigate the resolved stars  in M105,\na nearby E1 galaxy in the Leo I Group that is located at 10.6 Mpc \\citep{lee13}.\nM105 is located at the distance that is ideal for studying not only its resolved stars but also their radial distribution, if we use high resolution images.\nM105 has been known as one of the standard elliptical galaxies of which the surface brightness profile can be described impressively over many orders of magnitudes by the de Vaucouleurs $R^{1/4}$ law \\citep{dev79,cap90,wat14}.\n Basic parameters of M105 are listed in {\\bf Table \\ref{tab_info}}. \n Foreground reddening toward M105 is known to be very small, $E(B-V)=0.022$ \\citep{sch11}. \nCorresponding values are $A_I=0.037$ and $E(V-I)=0.030$. \nInternal reddening for the old red giants in elliptical galaxies must be low so that it is assumed to be zero in this study.\n\nResolved stars in M105 were studied previously by \\citet{sak97,gre04} and \\citet{har07b}.\n \\citet{sak97} estimated the distance to this galaxy using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method \\citep{lee93}, from\n the photometry of the resolved stars in the  \n $HST$/WFPC2 F814W images of a field $6\\arcmin$ west of M105 . \n However, they had only one-band images so that they had no color information of the resolved stars.  \n\\citet{gre04} presented F110W($J$) and F160W($H$) photometry of the resolved stars in three small fields at $R=3\\arcmin$, \n$R=4\\farcm5$, and $R=6\\arcmin$, based on $HST$ NICMOS images. They found that the resolved stars have a broad range of metallicity from [Fe/H]$\\sim-1.5$ to $+0.8$, with a mean of the solar metallicity.\nThey pointed out that the stellar population in their fields is similar to that of the bulge of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\\citet{har07b} observed a remote western field at  $R=12\\arcmin$ ($\\approx 12 R_{\\rm eff}$), using $HST$/ACS F606W and F814W filters.  \n\n\nThey carried out a better TRGB determination than the previous literature, being able to work with two color photometry. \n\nThey found that the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the red giant stars in this field is very broad and flat, \n\nshowing no dominant population. They stated that the shape of this MDF is not like any known MDFs of other galaxies. \nThey suggested also that the resolved stars in this remote region  is composed of two distinct subpopulations, metal-poor and metal-rich populations, noting that the metal-poor stars get more significant than the metal-rich stars with increasing radius in this outer region.\n\nIn this study we present photometry of the resolved stars \nin the inner region ($2\\arcmin<R\\leq6\\arcmin$) of M105,\nobtained from  F606W and F814W images  in the $HST$\narchive. Then we combine this with the photometry of the outer region studied previously by \\citet{har07b}, to investigate the stellar populations over a large radial range.\nSection 2 derives photometry of the point sources in the images and \n\\S3 presents color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the resolved stars in this galaxy,\nderives a distance to this galaxy using the TRGB method,\nestimates metallicities of bright RGB stars, presents their MDFs,\nand shows the radial distributions of the metal-poor and metal-rich RGB stars.\nIn \\S4 \nwe investigate the MDFs of the RGB stars in M105 with analytic chemical evolution models, \ncompare the MDFs of M105 with those of other nearby galaxies, and\nsuggest an updated dual halo mode scenario for the formation of massive ETGs. \n\nPrimary results are summarized in the final section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.96]{fig1.eps} \n\\caption{A finding chart for M105 (E1). \nHST fields used in this study are marked on the color map of \nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey: \none inner field M105-SE (at $R\\approx 4 R_{\\rm eff} \\approx 12$ kpc ) and one outer field M105-W  (at $R\\approx 12 R_{\\rm eff} \\approx 36 $ kpc). \nThe dashed-line represents a circle with $4\\arcmin$ radius centered on M105. \nNGC 3384 (SB0) is also marked in the north east of M105.\nA spiral galaxy  in the south-east region, NGC 3389 (Sc(s)), is known to be a background galaxy, being located about 10 Mpc behind M105.} \n\\label{fig_finder}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{lcccrrcc}\n\n\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.05in}\n\n\\tablecaption{A Summary of $HST$ Data for M105} \n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\n\\tablehead{ \\colhead{Field} & \\colhead{R.A.} &  \\colhead{Dec} & \\colhead{Instrument} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Exposure time [sec]} & \\colhead{Prop.

NGC 3389 belongs to another small group in the Leo I Cloud that is behind the Leo I Group \\citep{sti09}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_finder}} displays a finding chart for  M105, showing the $HST$ fields on the SDSS color image. \nF606W  and F814W images of two fields in M105\n\nare available in the $HST$ archive, as marked in this figure  and listed in {\\bf Table \\ref{tab_data}} :\n a south-eastern inner field (called the M105--SE field), and a western outer field (called the M105--W field) that was used previously for the study of resolved stars by \\citet{har07b}.\nThe M105--SE field is located at $R\\sim 4\\arcmin$ from the galaxy center, while the M105--W field is at $R\\sim 12\\arcmin$.\n\n \nWe combined the images of the M105--SE and W fields to make a mosaic drizzled image for the entire observed field, using Tweakreg and AstroDrizzle tasks in DrizzlePac provided by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) \\\\\n(http://www.stsci.edu/hst/HST$\\_$overview/drizzlepac/), as done in \\citet{jan14}.\n\n\n\n\nThe final images have a pixel scale, $0\\farcs03$ per pixel.\nTotal exposure times are 19,550 s  for each of F606W and F814W. \nThese exposure times are slightly shorter than those for the M105-W field, \nbut are still long enough to study the resolved stars in the M105-SE field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{fig3.eps} \n\\caption{$I-(V-I)$ CMDs of the resolved stars in M105:\n(a) $R \\le 3\\arcmin$, (b) $3\\arcmin< R  \\le 4\\arcmin$,\n(c) $4\\arcmin < R  \\le 6\\arcmin$, and (d) $9\\arcmin<R  \\le 13\\arcmin$.\nSmoothed maps display the number density maps for the high density regions (Hess diagrams).\nRed solid lines represent theoretical isochrones for 12 Gyr age, [$\\alpha$/Fe]=0.2, and a range of metallicity ([Fe/H] = --2.4 to +0.2 ([M/H] = --2.2 to +0.4 ) with a step of 0.2 from left to right) in the Dartmouth models \\citep{dot08}.

We selected the point sources using the sharpness parameters provided by DAOPHOT.\nThen we converted the instrumental magnitudes of the sources to the standard Johnson-Cousins $VI$ Vega magnitudes, following \\citet{sir05}. \n\nWe estimated the completeness of our photometry using artificial star experiments.\nFirst, we selected four $0.5\\arcmin \\times 0.5\\arcmin$ subregions at different galactocentric radii. \nWe generated artificial stars with colors $(V-I)=0.1 - 4.9$ (in steps of 0.2 mag) and magnitudes  $I=24.5-30.0$ mag. Then we added $\\sim$5000 (about 10 \\% of the detected point sources) artificial stars in each sub-region,  \nand iterated this procedure four  times to increase the total number of artificial stars.\nWe estimated the recovery rate (completeness) from the ratio of the number of the recovered stars and that\nof the added stars. \n\n{\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_comp1}} presents the completeness as a function of $I$ magnitudes for four color values ($(V-I)=1.5, 2.5, 3.5$, and 4.5).\n\nThe 50\\% completeness levels for $(V-I)=3.5$ are $I\\approx 28.0$ mag at the outer region, and they get brighter as the color gets redder or the galactocentric distance decreases. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\n\\subsection{CMDs of the Resolved Stars}\n\nIn {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_cmd}} we display \nCMDs of the resolved stars in the four ranges of projected galactocentric distance \n\nof M105: (a) $2\\arcmin < R  \\le 3\\arcmin$, (b) $3\\arcmin < R  \\le 4\\arcmin$,\n(c) $4\\arcmin < R  \\le 6\\arcmin$, and (d) $9\\arcmin <R \\le 13\\arcmin$.\nThe M105-SE field covers $2\\arcmin \\lesssim R \\lesssim 6\\arcmin$, while\nthe M105-W field covers $9\\arcmin \\lesssim R \\lesssim 13\\arcmin$.\nWe plotted a Hess diagram for the region with high number density in the CMDs to show better the details.\nThe dashed lines denote 50\\% and 20\\% completeness, and the dot-dashed line represents $M_{\\rm bol}=-3.0$ mag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reference we overlayed theoretical RGB loci of the 12 Gyr isochrones for $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}] = 0.2$ and a range of metallicity ([Fe/H] = --2.4 to 0.2 with a step of 0.2 from left to right)\n  in the Dartmouth models \\citep{dot08}.\nThey were shifted according to the distance and foreground reddening of M105.\nWe adopted [M/H] = [Fe/H]+$[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]$, where $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}] = 0.2$.\n\n\nA few distinguishable features are noted in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_cmd}}.\nFirst, most of the resolved stars in M105 are RGB stars. \nThe RGB stars  show a large range of color, indicating that their metallicity ranges from very low ([Fe/H]$\\approx -2.4$) to solar metallicity or higher. \nThe sources brighter than the RGB stars appear to be a combination of old asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, foreground stars, and blended stars due to crowding, as discussed in the study of the M105-W field by \\citet{har07b}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, \nthe RGB  in the outer region ($9\\arcmin<R \\le 13\\arcmin$) in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_cmd}(d)} \nshows clearly two distinguishable components: a narrow blue RGB and a wider red RGB, as shown also by \\citet{har07b}.\nThe blue RGB is more clearly seen \nin this outer region than in the inner regions. \n\n\nIt is noted that our photometry of the outer region goes about one magnitude deeper for the red stars than that of the same region given by \\citet{har07b}, although both studies used the same raw data. \nThe 50\\% completeness limit for $(V-I)=3.0$ is\n$I \\approx 28.0$ mag in our photometry, while it is $I\\approx 26.8$ mag in\n \\citet{har07b} (their {\\bf Figure 3}). We infer that this difference is mainly due to the improvement of image combining in the drizzle package used in this study.\n\n\nThird, \nthe positions of the isochrones for 12 Gyrs are consistent with the RGB in the CMDs, indicating that the RGB stars are mostly very old.\n\nIn {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_cdf}} we plotted the $(V-I)$ color distribution of the bright RGB stars ($-3.7 < M_{\\rm bol} \\le -3.0$) \nin the inner ($3\\arcmin < R  \\le 4\\arcmin$ and $4\\arcmin < R \\le 6\\arcmin$) and outer ($9\\arcmin < R \\le 13\\arcmin$) regions.\nWe derived $M_{\\rm bol}$ of the RGB stars as described in the next section.\nThe color distributions of the bright RGB stars in the outer region of  M105 show a clear bimodality:\na narrow blue component with a color range of $1.2 <(V-I)<1.7$ and  a peak at $(V-I) \\approx 1.5$,\nand a broad red component with a color range of   $1.8 <(V-I)<4.1$ and a peak at  $(V-I) \\approx 2.8$.\nThe blue peak is higher than the red peak in this outer region.\nThe color distribution of the bright RGB stars in the inner region of  M105 shows also a bimodality, but in a weaker contrast than that of the outer region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{fig4.eps} \n\\caption{$(V-I)$ color distributions of the bright RGB stars \n($-3.7 < M_{\\rm bol} \\le -3.0$) at \n$3\\arcmin< R  \\le 4\\arcmin$ (open histogram),\n$4\\arcmin < R \\le 6\\arcmin$ (hatched histogram), and \n$9\\arcmin<R  \\le 13\\arcmin$ (filled histogram).\n} \n\\label{fig_cdf}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Distance Estimation}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{fig5.eps} \n\\caption{$I$-band luminosity functions (histograms) and its corresponding edge detection response functions (red solid lines) for the red giants with $1.2<(V-I)\\leq2.0$ \nat $4\\arcmin<R <6\\arcmin$  (a) and\n $9\\arcmin<R <13\\arcmin$ (b).\n} \n\\label{fig_ilf}\n\\end{figure}\n \nWe determined a distance to M105 using the TRGB method \n\\citep{lee93,sak96,riz07} as follows. \nFirst, we derived the $I$-band luminosity functions of the red giants in the inner and outer regions ($4\\arcmin<R \\leq6\\arcmin$ and  $9\\arcmin<R \\leq13\\arcmin$) of M105 where crowding is not so severe.\nThe RGB stars show a broad range of color. \nWe selected relatively blue stars with $1.2<(V-I)<2.0$ among the RGB stars for better measurement of the TRGB, and derived their $I$-band luminosity functions as shown in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_ilf}}.\n\n\nUsing the edge-detecting algorithm \\citep{men02, sak96} weighted according to the number of stars in each magnitude bin,\nwe determined the TRGB magnitude more quantitatively.\nFrom the luminosity function $\\Phi (m)$, we calculated an edge-detection response function \n$E(m)$ ($= \\sqrt{\\Phi}[ \\log(\\Phi (m + \\sigma_m )) -   \\log(\\Phi (m - \\sigma_m ))])  $,  \nwhere \n$\\sigma_m$ is the mean photometric error within a bin of $\\pm0.05$ mag about magnitude $m$. \n\nThey were plotted by the solid lines in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_ilf}}. \nThe errors for the TRGB magnitudes were \nobtained using the bootstrap resampling method. \n\nIn each simulation we resampled randomly\nthe RGB sample with replacement to make a new sample of the same size. We performed one thousand simulations. We estimated the TRGB magnitude for each simulation using the same procedure, and derived the standard deviation of the estimated TRGB magnitudes.\n\nThus estimated TRGB magnitude for the inner region is \n$I_{\\rm TRGB} = 26.02\\pm0.02$, which is almost the same as that for the outer region,  $I_{\\rm TRGB} = 26.03\\pm0.03$.\nThe median color of the TRGB is derived from the colors of the selected bright red giants close to the TRGB:\n $(V-I)_{\\rm TRGB} =  1.61\\pm0.02$ for the inner region, and\n $1.54\\pm0.03$ for the outer region.\nWe used the TRGB calibration given in \\citet{riz07}: \n$M_{{\\rm I,TRGB}} = -4.05(\\pm0.02) + 0.217(\\pm0.01)( (V-I)_0 -1.6)$ (where $(V-I)_0$ is a reddening corrected color of the TRGB) with a systematic error of 0.12.\n\n\nAfter correction for foreground reddening, we derived a distance modulus \n$(m-M)_0=30.04\\pm0.02$ for the inner region, and\n $30.07\\pm0.03$ for the outer region.\n We adopted a mean of these two estimates,\n$(m-M)_0=30.05\\pm0.02$ with a systematic error of 0.12\n(corresponding to a linear distance of $10.23\\pm0.09$ Mpc).\nAt this distance one arcsec corresponds to 49.6 pc.\nThe results of distance estimation for M105 \nare summarized in {\\bf Table \\ref{tab_distance}}. \nThis shows that M105 is located at the distance similar to those of M66, M96, and NGC 3377 in the same Leo I Group \\citep{lee13}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{lcc}\n\n\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.05in}\n\n\\tablecaption{A Summary of TRGB Distance Measurements for M105}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\n\\tablehead{ \\colhead{Parameter}  &  \\colhead{M105-SE} & \\colhead{M105-W} \n} \n\\startdata\nTRGB magnitude, $I_{TRGB}$\t\t\t\t\t&  $26.02\\pm0.02$ & $26.03\\pm0.03$ \\\\\nTRGB color, $(V-I)_{TRGB}$\t\t\t\t\t&  $1.61\\pm0.02$ & $1.54\\pm0.03$ \\\\\nForeground extinction at $V$, $A_{V}$\t& 0.071 & 0.062\\\\\nForeground extinction at $I$, $A_{I}$\t&  0.039 & 0.034\\\\\nForeground reddening, $E(V-I)$\t\t& 0.032 & 0.028 \\\\\nIntrinsic TRGB magnitude $I_{0,TRGB}$\t\t& $25.98\\pm0.03$ & $26.00\\pm0.03$\\\\\nIntrinsic TRGB color, $(V-I)_{0,TRGB}$\t\t&  $1.58\\pm0.03$ & $1.51\\pm0.03$\\\\\nAbsolute TRGB magnitude, $M_{I,TRGB}$\t\t&$-4.06$ & $-4.07$\\\\\nDistance modulus, $(m-M)_0$\t\t\t\t\t& $30.04\\pm0.02$ & $30.07\\pm0.03$\\\\\n                          & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{mean = $30.05\\pm0.02\\pm0.12$ }  \\\\\nDistance\t\t\t\t\t&  $10.17\\pm0.09$ Mpc & $10.30\\pm0.14$ Mpc\\\\\n\t\t\t\t\t& \\multicolumn{2}{c}{mean = $10.23\\pm0.08$ Mpc}  \\\\\n\\hline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\enddata\n\\label{tab_distance}\n\\end{deluxetable*}\n\n\nThe distance to M105 was estimated using various methods in the past.\nOur estimate based on the TRGB method ( $(m-M)_0 = 30.05\\pm 0.02({\\rm ran})\\pm0.12 ({\\rm sys})$)  is consistent with those derived using the planetary nebula luminosity function \n($30.09\\pm 0.09$ \\citep{cia93}, $29.98\\pm 0.11$ \\citep{cia02}), and\nthe surface brightness fluctuation method \n( $30.32\\pm0.14$  \\citep{ton01}, and   $30.16\\pm0.14$ \\citep{jen03}). \n However, our value is much smaller than those based on the globular cluster luminosity function. \\citet{lar01} derived $30.93\\pm 0.12$ from the  total globular cluster sample, $31.92\\pm 0.30$ from the red globular cluster sample, and $30.15\\pm 0.12$ from the blue globular cluster sample. The first two values are much larger than ours, while the last is consistent with ours. However, these estimates were based on a small number of globular clusters (30 blue globular clusters and 24 red globular clusters with $20<V<24$ mag) so that their estimates must suffer from a significant uncertainty.\n \nThere are a few studies of the TRGB distance measurements for M105 in the literature. \n\\citet{sak97} presented TRGB measurements,\n\n$I_{TRGB}=26.32\\pm0.05$ and $(m-M)_0=30.30\\pm0.14$ \n(adopting $A_I = 0.05$), from the $HST$/WFPC2 images.\nTheir TRGB magnitude is 0.3 mag fainter than our measurement, $I_{\\rm TRGB} = 26.03\\pm0.03$. It is noted that \\citet{sak97} used only F814W images\nfor their analysis, while we used much deeper F606W and F814W images.\n\\citet{gre04} also derived a distance estimate from the F160W band TRGB magnitude based on the HST/NICMOS images,\n$(m-M)_0=30.14\\pm0.14$. \nLater \\citet{har07b} presented TRGB measurements based on the same HST/ACS images of the M105-W field as used in this study,\n$I_{TRGB}=26.10\\pm0.10$ and $(m-M)_0=30.06\\pm0.10$.\nThus the values for the TRGB magnitude and distance in this study, \\citet{har07b}, and \\citet{gre04} are in excellent agreement, but these TRGB values are 0.2 to 0.3 mag brighter than the value given by \\citet{sak97}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{fig6.eps} \n\\caption{RGBs

their $(V-I)$ colors with the theoretical isochrones, following the method used in \\citet{har07a,har07b}. \n\n\n\nWe assumed that the mean age of the stars in this galaxy is 12 Gyr, as found from \nspectroscopic measurement of mean ages of the stellar populations in  the regions at 2.6--3.5 $R/R_{\\rm eff}$ of M105 by \\citet{wei09}.\n\n\n\n\nIn {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_iso}} we plotted the CMDs for the RGBs of 12 Gyr isochrones \n\n in the Dartmouth models \\citep{dot08} in comparison with one of the recent models for old stellar populations, the Victoria-Regina models \\citep{van12, van14}.\nWe also overlayed the RGB sequences of five Milky Way globular clusters \\citep{dac90}: \nM15 ([Fe/H] $=-2.37$),\nM2 ([Fe/H] $=-1.65$),\nNGC 1851 ([Fe/H] $=-1.18$),\n47 Tuc (NGC 104, [Fe/H] $=-0.72$),\nNGC 6553 ([Fe/H] $=-0.18$),\nand one old open cluster NGC 6791 ([Fe/H] $=+0.2$ to +0.35) \\citep{gar94,cha99}. \nThe [Fe/H] values of the globular clusters are from the 2010 edition of  the catalog of the Milky Way globular clusters \\citep{har96}.  \nNGC 6791 is known to be 8.5 Gyr old, a few Gyrs younger than the globular clusters, and its metallicity is estimated to be [Fe/H]$=+0.20$ to +0.35 \\citep{har00,van14}.\n\n\nA comparison of the Dartmouth isochrones with the RGBs of the globular clusters shows that the isochrones for [Fe/H] = --2.0, --1.6, --1.2, and --0.8 are roughly  in agreement with the RGBs of M15, M2, NGC 1851, and 47 Tuc, respectively.\nThe RGB of the metal-rich bulge globular cluster NGC 6553 with [Fe/H] $=-0.18$ is seen between the Dartmouth isochrones for [Fe/H] = --0.4 and [Fe/H] = $0.0$, and that of the old open cluster NGC 6791  is located between the isochrones for [Fe/H] = 0.0 and [Fe/H] = $+0.4$.\n\nOn the other hand, \n\nthe Victoria-Regina isochrones are slightly redder for [Fe/H] = --2.0, similar for [Fe/H] = --1.6, and bluer or brighter than for [Fe/H] $>-1.6$, compared with the Dartmouth isochrones.\n\n\nThe RGBs of the isochrones become redder (cooler) as the value of [$\\alpha$/Fe] increases. \n\nWe adopted, as a reference value, [$\\alpha$/Fe] = +0.2, for the study of the resolved stars with a large range of metallicity in M105.\nIn this study we used the Dartmouth isochrones as provided.\nIt is noted that recognizing the difference between the old versions of Victoria-Regina models and the RGB sequences of clusters, \n\\citet{har00,har02}  adjusted slightly the colors of the isochrones using the cluster sequence for their study of the MDFs. \n\n\nWe derived a metallicity of each star in M105 from the comparison of the CMDs with the Dartmouth isochrones.\nThe problem due to the curvature of the RGBs for high metallicity is more serious in the ($M_I$, $(V-I)_0$) plane compared with in the ($M_{\\rm bol}$, $(V-I)_0$) plane so some of the previous studies adopted the latter plane for interpolation \\citep{har00,har02}. \nHowever, it is not easy to convert an observational ($M_I$, $(V-I)_0$)  plane of stars to an ($M_{\\rm bol}$, $(V-I)_0$) plane for the metal-rich stars because of the significantly curved RGB sequences, while \nit is straightforward to convert a theoretical ($M_{\\rm bol}$, $(V-I)_0$) plane of models to an  ($M_I$, $(V-I)_0$) plane. \nTherefore we used ($M_I$, $(V-I)_0$) planes rather than ($M_{\\rm bol}$, $(V-I)_0$) planes for interpolation to derive a metallicity value of each star.\n \nTo reduce the uncertainties due to the curved tracks and non-linearity in the [M/H]-color relations as much as possible, we generated\nfine grids with steps d[M/H] = 0.01 (for [M/H]$>-0.4$), 0.02  (for $-0.6<$[M/H]$\\leq -0.4$), and 0.1 (for $-2.4<$[M/H]$\\leq -0.6$) using the Dartmouth models.  \nFor this we used non-linear interpolation between the tracks.\nThus the errors in interpolations are supposed to be negligible. \n\n\nThe color range for the same metallicity range becomes wider, as the RGB stars become brighter, as seen in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_cmd}}. \nIn addition,\nthe photometric errors become smaller and the photometric completeness gets higher, as the stars become brighter. \nTherefore the derived MDFs are considered to be more reliable for brighter RGB stars. \nThe $I$-band magnitudes of the reddest (the highest metallicity) stars become fainter as the color increases so that some of them may be missed, being affected by the incompleteness of our photometry. Therefore \nwe derived the metallicity of the stars in the \n$M_I - (V-I)_0$ diagram where $(V-I)_0$ represents colors corrected for foreground reddening.\n\nIn {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_mdf}} we display the MDFs for the bright RGB stars (with the bolometric magnitude $M_{\\rm bol} \\leq -3.0$ mag) in the inner  region ($4\\arcmin<R \\leq 6\\arcmin$) and the outer region ($9\\arcmin<R  \\leq 13\\arcmin$) of M105 where the completeness of our photometry is the highest.\nFor deriving the MDFs we used the regions where photometric completeness is higher than 50\\% for $M_{\\rm bol} = - 3.0$ and [M/H]$<0.2$, selecting a less crowded region at $R>4\\arcmin$ in the case of the inner field. \nWe corrected the incompleteness of the MDFs using the completeness test results derived in this study. Completeness correction is negligible in the outer region, while it is significant in the high end of the MDFs in the inner region. However, it is noted that the peak position of the metal-rich component increased only by about 0.1 dex after completeness correction even in the inner region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{fig7.eps} \n\\caption{(a,b) MDFs for the bright RGB stars ($-3.7 < M_{\\rm bol}\\le -3.0$) in the inner region ($4\\arcmin<R \\le 6\\arcmin$) and the outer region ($9\\arcmin<R \\le 13\\arcmin$) of M105. \n\n\nFilled histograms and hatched histograms show \nthe MDFs before and after completeness correction, respectively.\n\nBlue dashed lines, red dot-dashed lines, and purple solid lines represent the double Gaussian fits for completeness-corrected MDFs: metal-poor component, metal-rich component, and their sum.\nThe yellow histogram represents the completeness-corrected MDF of the bright RGB stars ($-3.5<M_{\\rm bol} <-3.0$) in the outer region given by \\citet{har07b}(their {\\bf Figure 6}).

It is seen clearly that there is a significant excess above the MDF of the inner region in the low metallicity range at [M/H] $<-0.7$. \nThis is distinct from typical forms of the MDFs of stars in massive galaxies that show a single major metal-rich component with a long weak tail in the low metallicity \\citep{har02}. \n\nThis is also in strong contrast against the MDF of the same region given by \\citet{har07b} (their {\\bf Figure 6}), which is overlayed by the yellow histogram in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_mdf}(b)}. \\citet{har07b} pointed out that the MDF of the outer region in M105 is the broadest and flattest among the known MDFs of galaxies, and that they could not find any dominant subpopulation in their MDF. \n\n\nTo check and quantify the bimodality, we fit the data with two Gaussian functions using mpfitexpr task in IDL, as summarized in {\\bf Table \\ref{tab_fits}}. \n\nWe tested also the bimodality of the MDFs of these stars using the Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) package program provided by \\citet{mur10}.\n\n\nThese tests show that a unimodal distribution is rejected for both the inner and outer regions (the probability for the unimodal distribution $p$ is much smaller than 0.1\\%). The MDF for the outer region is clearly bimodal with peaks at [M/H] $=-0.09$ and --1.12 (the value of the bimodality parameter, $D=2.93\\pm0.24$,  is larger than the bimodality criterion 2), while that for the inner region is marginally bimodal with peaks  at [M/H] $=-0.01$ and --0.68 \n(the value of $D$, $1.78\\pm0.03$, slightly smaller but close to 2).\nThe MDFs are reasonably well fit by the double Gaussian functions not only for the outer region but also for the inner region. \nHowever, this Gaussian function fitting is only for showing the presence of bimodality in the MDFs, without any physical justification.\nWe will discuss these MDFs further in terms of chemical evolution models in Section 4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{fig8.eps} \n\\caption{ Radial number density profiles of the bright RGB stars ($I \\leq 27.0$) in M105 corrected for completeness.\n(Left panel) Circles, squares, and triangles represent the metal-poor stars (${\\rm [M/H]} \\leq -0.7$),  metal-rich stars (${\\rm[M/H]} > -0.7$), and all stars,  respectively.\n(Right panel) Circles, pentagons, squares, and triangles represent the metal-poor stars (${\\rm [M/H]} \\leq -1.0$),  intermediate metallicity stars ($-1.0<{\\rm[M/H]} \\leq -0.5$), metal-rich stars (${\\rm[M/H]} > -0.5$), and all stars,  respectively.\nThe dashed line represents the $V$ band surface brightness profile along the major axis in\n\n\\citet{wat14}.\nSolid lines represent Sersic profile fits of each stellar number density profile.\n\n\n}\n\\label{fig_radden}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{fig9.eps} \n\\caption{ Same as {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_radden}}, but for the power law fits. \n\nDashed lines represent the power law fit results that \\citet{har07b} derived for the outer region ($9\\arcmin<R<13\\arcmin$) only:\n$N=1.2\\pm0.7$ for the metal-poor stars and $N=6.0\\pm0.6$ for the metal-rich stars. Note that they do not match the data for the inner region.\n}\n\\label{fig_radden2}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nSecond, the peak metallicity of the metal-rich component in the inner region is [M/H] $= -0.01\\pm0.01$, \nwhich is slightly higher than \nthat for the outer region, [M/H] $= -0.10\\pm0.02$. \nIn contrast, the peak metallicity of the metal-poor component in the inner region is [M/H] $= -0.60\\pm0.04$, somewhat higher than that for the outer region, [M/H] $= -1.10\\pm0.05$.\n\nHowever, typical MDFs of stars in the inner regions of massive galaxies are not Gaussian, but follow a \ndominant quasi-gaussian form with a long tail toward the low metallicity end. Therefore the value for the genuine peak of the metal-poor component in the inner region must be much lower than [M/H] $=-0.6$, which will be shown in Section 4.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Radial Distributions  of the RGB Stars}\n\nSince the MDFs of the RGB stars are bimodal, we divided the sample of bright RGB stars \ninto two groups according to their metallicity: \n a metal-poor group ($[{\\rm M/H}]\\leq -0.7$),  and a metal-rich group ($[{\\rm M/H}]>-0.7$).\n\n\nWe selected a cut with $[{\\rm M/H}]=-0.7$, for which the MDF shows the minimum value between the two peaks in M105.\nThen we derived radial number density profiles of the bright stars ($I\\leq 27.0$ mag) in these groups, \nand plotted them in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_radden}(a)}.\nWe corrected these profiles using the completeness data we derived in Section 2.2. \nWe also plotted the $V$-band surface brightness profile (solid lines) of M105 given by \\citet{wat14}  (in their {\\bf Figure 6}) for comparison.\nThis surface brightness profile extends out to the semi-major axis radius, SMA$\\approx 850\\arcsec$, covering a wider area than the old data given in \\citet{cap90}.\nWe fit the radial number density profiles with\na Sersic law \\citep{ser63} and a power law, adopting no weighting.\n\nSeveral distinguishable features are noted  in this figure as follows.\nFirst, the radial number density profile of the metal-rich stars is described by a Sersic law with $n=2.75\\pm0.10$  \nfor the entire range of the galactocentric radius ($3\\arcmin < R < 13\\arcmin$), \nwhile that of the metal-poor stars  is fit well by\na Sersic law with $n=6.89\\pm0.94$. \nThe radial number density profile of the total sample is fit well with a Sersic index $n=3.71\\pm0.21$, close to the value of the de Vaucouleurs law. \n\n\nSecond, the slopes of the radial number density profiles of both groups and the surface brightness profile are similar in the inner region.\nHowever, the slope of the radial number density profiles of the total sample is much steeper than that of the surface brightness profile in the outer region where the surface brightness is too faint to be measured reliably \\citep{wat14}.\n\nThird,\nthe radial number density profile of the metal-poor stars is much flatter than that of the metal-rich stars in the outer region.\n\nThus the radial number density profile of the metal-poor stars is more extended than that of the metal-rich stars in the outer region.\nFourth, the mean number density of the metal-rich stars is much larger (several times) than that of the metal-poor  stars in the inner region. The number density of the metal-poor  stars become similar to that of the metal-rich stars in the outer region at $R\\approx 10\\arcmin$, and exceed the latter beyond  $R\\approx 10\\arcmin$.\n\nFifth, \n\n\nThe effective radius for the total sample is derived to be $R_{\\rm eff} = 0\\farcm92 \\pm 0\\farcm10$, which is consistent with the effective radius of the integrated stellar light of the galaxy, $58\\farcs7$. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\citet{har07b} found that the radial profile of the metal-rich \n([M/H]$>-0.7$) stars in the M105-W Field is fit well with a power law, \n$\\sigma \\sim R^{-6.0\\pm0.6}$, much steeper  than that of the metal-poor  ([M/H]$<-0.7$) stars, $\\sigma \\sim R^{-1.2\\pm0.7}$.\nWe plotted these power laws by the dashed lines in {\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_radden2}(a)}.\n\nThe radial density profiles of the outer region derived in this study are consistent  with these two power laws.\nHowever, those of the inner region show large deviations from these two power laws: the radial profile of the metal-rich stars is flatter \nthan, and that of the metal-poor stars is steeper than the values extrapolated from the \\citet{har07a}'s fits. \nThe radial profiles of the metal-rich stars and metal-poor stars in the entire range are fit well by power laws with $\\sigma \\sim R^{-3.83\\pm0.03}$ and $\\sigma \\sim R^{-2.58\\pm0.03}$, respectively.\n\n\n\nAfter subtracting the metal-rich component derived from the accreting gas model of chemical evolution in Section 4.1, the residual MDFs of the metal-poor components in the inner region and the outer region are found to be similar, as shown in {\\bf Figure 10(c)}.  A cut with [M/H]$<-0.7$ covers 93\\% of the metal-poor component in the inner region, and a similar fraction, 95\\%, in the outer region. \nThus the contribution of the low metallicity tail of the metal-rich component to this range is  6.8\\% in the inner region and 8.6\\% in the outer region. \nThus there may be some selection bias in the derived radial profiles with a given [M/H] cut value. \n\nTo check this, we divided the [M/H] range into three groups [M/H] $<-1$, (--1 to --0.5), and $>-0.5$, and derived the radial profiles for each, as shown in the right panels of {\\bf Figures 8} and {\\bf 9}. \nIn this case, the range [M/H] $<-1.0$ covers 55\\% of the metal-poor component in the inner region, and 76\\% in the outer region. The contribution of the low metallicity tail of the metal-rich component to this range is 3.0\\% in the inner region and 3.5\\% in the outer region.\nIt is expected that the radial profiles of the metal-poor component for [M/H] $=-1.0$ cut will be flatter than that for [M/H] $=-0.7$ cut.\nThis is seen in {\\bf Figures 8(b)} and {\\bf 9(b)}: the power index of the metal-poor component for [M/H]  $=-0.7$ cut is $N=2.58\\pm0.03$, which is slightly larger than the value for [M/H] $=-1.0$ cut, $N=2.28\\pm0.02$. \nOn the other hand, the value of the power law index for the metal-rich component does not change depending on the [M/H] cut value, with $N=3.83\\pm0.03$ for [M/H] $\\geq -0.7$ and $N=3.82\\pm0.02$ for [M/H] $\\geq -0.5$. Thus there is some selection bias in the radial profiles due to the [M/H] cut value, but it is not significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Analytic Chemical Evolution Models for the MDFs}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{lcccccc}\n\\tabletypesize{\\footnotesize} \n\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.05in}\n\n\\tablecaption{A Summary of Chemical Evolution Model Fits}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\n\\tablehead{ \n\\colhead{Region} & \\colhead{Component} &  \\colhead{Pristine} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Pre-enriched} &  \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Accreting gas} \\\\\n\\colhead{} & \\colhead{} &  \\colhead{closed-box} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{closed-box} &  \\multicolumn{2}{c}{} \\\\\n\t& & $p(Z_\\odot)$ & $p(Z_\\odot)$ & [M/H]$_0$ & $p(Z_\\odot)$ & $M$  \n} \n\\startdata\nInner region & Single & $0.84\\pm0.01$ & $0.81\\pm0.01$ & $-2.18\\pm0.03$ & $1.14\\pm0.02$ & $2.93\\pm0.18$ \\\\\nOuter region & Single & $0.62\\pm0.03$ & $0.62\\pm0.03$ & $\\leq-4.0$ & $0.79\\pm0.02$ & $1.36\\pm0.51$ \\\\\n\\hline\n               & Double &  &  &  &  &  \\\\\nInner region& Metal-rich &  &  &  & $1.14\\pm0.02$ & $2.93\\pm0.18$ \\\\\n\t\t\t& Metal-poor & $0.11\\pm0.01$ & $0.10\\pm0.01$ & $-2.42\\pm0.03$ & $0.10\\pm0.02$ & $1.35\\pm0.63$ \\\\\nOuter region& Metal-rich & &  &  & $0.90\\pm0.04$ & $2.84\\pm0.51$ \\\\\n\t\t\t& Metal-poor & $0.06\\pm0.01$ & $0.05\\pm0.01$ & $-2.29\\pm0.01$ & $0.06\\pm0.01$ & $1.83\\pm0.56$ \\\\\n\n\n\\enddata\n\n\\label{tab_CEm105}\n\\end{deluxetable*}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{fig10.eps} \n\\caption{Chemical evolution models for the MDFs of the bright RGB stars ($M_{\\rm bol} \\le 3.0$) in the inner region ($4\\arcmin<R \\le 6\\arcmin$) (left panels) and outer region ($9\\arcmin<R \\le 13\\arcmin$) (right panels) of M105. \n(Top panels) Single component models.\n(Middle panels) Double component accreting gas models.\nThe fitting range for the chemical evolution models is [M/H]$<+0.3$.\n(Bottom panels) The residual MDFs after subtraction of the metal-rich component in the accreting gas model.\nYellow dot-dashed lines, blue dashed lines, and red solid lines denote the pristine closed-box models, the pre-enriched closed-box models, and the accreting gas models, respectively. \nFitting parameters for the models are listed in {\\bf Table \\ref{tab_CEm105}}.\n} \n\\label{fig_CEm105}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nSimple analytic chemical evolution models have been used to investigate how galaxies evolve from the comparison with the MDFs of resolved stars in nearby galaxies (\\citet{tal71,lyn75,tin80,pag97,har07a,har07b,kir11,pea15} and references therein).\nWe compared the MDFs of the resolved stars in M105 with three analytic chemical evolution models, as applied to the studies of the Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies by \\citet{kir11}  and NGC 3115 by \\citet{pea15}: a pristine closed-box model,\na pre-enriched closed-box model, and an accreting gas model.\n\n\nFirst, the pristine closed-box model is based on the assumptions that a galaxy is a closed-box with no inflow or outflow, that gas is converted only by star formation,\nand that initial gas (pristine gas) is metal-free.

Then the residual MDF is fit using another model. Then we subtract this model from the original MDF, and fit the it with an accreting gas model. \nWe iterate this procedure until the entire MDF is fit well by the double component models. \n\n\n{\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_CEm105}} shows several interesting features.\nFirst, in the case of single component models (top panels), the MDF of the inner region is fit reasonably well by the accreting gas model, but not by any of the closed-box models. \nOn the other hand, the MDF of the outer region is poorly fit with any of the models. \nThe MDF of the outer region shows a significant excess above the accretion model in the low metallicity range, while that of the inner region reveals a weak excess in the similar low metallicity range at [M/H]$\\leq-0.7$.\n\n\nSecond, the MDFs of both regions are fit remarkably well by the accreting gas model with double components (middle panels). \nTo show better the MDFs of the metal-poor component only, we subtracted the metal-rich component models from the original MDF, and displayed the residuals in the bottom panels.\nThe errorbars in the residual MDFs represent Poisson errors of the original MDFs.\nIt has been generally assumed in the chemical evolution models that the yield ($p$) does not vary depending on metallicity. If the yield is a function of metallicity, a single-component accreting gas model would fit the data even for the low metallicity range. However, there are no physical justifications for this and nothing is known about how it varies as a function of metallicity.\n\n\nThird, interestingly the residual MDFs  show clearly an excess in the low metallicity range at [M/H]$\\leq-0.5$ in both the inner and outer regions. \nThe excess in the narrow high metallicity range  at [M/H]$>0.0$ for the inner region is dominated by  the errors,  as shown by the errorbars,\n\nand also by the larger uncertainty in the metallicity estimation so that it can be ignored. \nWe fit the residual MDFs for [M/H]$\\leq-0.5$ with single component models, finding that all three models fit reasonably well the residual MDFs.\nIt is noted  also that the shapes of the residual MDFs in both regions appear to be similar to those for the bright dwarf spheroidal galaxies \\citep{kir11}. \n\n\nFourth, in the accreting gas models with double components,\nthe metal yield parameter for the metal-rich component ($p=(1.14\\pm0.02) Z_\\odot$) in the inner region is about one order of magnitude larger than that for the metal-poor component ($p=(0.10\\pm0.02) Z_\\odot$), \nwhile  the final mass parameter for the metal-rich component ($M=2.93\\pm0.18$) for the inner region is about twice larger than that for the metal-poor component ($M=1.35\\pm0.63$).\nSimilar trends are also seen in the outer region:\n$p=(0.90\\pm0.04) Z_\\odot$ and $M=2.84\\pm0.51$ for the metal-rich component, and\n$p=(0.06\\pm0.01) Z_\\odot$ and $M=1.83\\pm0.56$ for the metal-poor component.\n\n\nFifth, \nthe size ratio of the metal-rich component and the metal-poor component is 21.6:1.0 for the inner region, and\n2.4:1.0 for the outer region. Thus the contribution of the metal-poor component is minor (4.4\\%) in the inner region, but it\nbecomes significant (29.4\\%)  in the outer region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{lccccccc}\n\\tabletypesize{\\footnotesize} \n\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.05in}\n\n\\tablecaption{A Summary of HST Data for Nearby Early-type Galaxies}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\n\\tablehead{ \\colhead{Parameter}  & \\colhead{Virgo Core Field} & \\colhead{NGC 5128} &  \\colhead{NGC 3377} & \\colhead{NGC 404} & \\colhead{NGC 5011C}  & \\colhead{ESO410-005} & \n} \n\\startdata\n\nP.I.\t& 10131  & 9373 & 9811 & 10915 & 12546 & 10503\\\\\nR.A.(2000)\t& 12 28 10.9 & 13 25 14.01 & 10 47 48.1& 01 09 17.0& 13 13 11.9 & 00 15 32.2 \\\\\nDec(2000) \t& +12 33 21 & --43 34 27.8 & +13 55 45 & +35 44 46 & --43 15 56 & --32 10 36 \\\\\nInstrument & ACS/WFC & ACS/WFC & ACS/WFC & WFPC2 & ACS/WFC  & ACS/WFC \\\\\nT(exp), F606W  & 63,440s  & 30,880s & 38,500s & 36,400s & 900s & 13,440s \\\\\nT(exp), F814W  & 26,880s  & 30,880s & 22,260s & 36,400s & 900s & 26,880s \\\\\n\\hline\n\\enddata\n\n\\label{tab_4gallog} \n\\end{deluxetable*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{lccccccccc}\n\\tabletypesize{\\scriptsize} \n\n\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{0.05in}\n\n\\tablecaption{A Summary of Basic Information for Nearby Early-type Galaxies}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\n\\tablehead{ \\colhead{Parameter} & \\colhead{M105} & \\colhead{Virgo Core Field$^a$} & \\colhead{NGC 5128} & \\colhead{NGC 3377} & \\colhead{NGC 404} & \\colhead{NGC 5011C}  & \\colhead{ESO410-005} & Reference& \n} \n\\startdata\nR.A.(2000) \t& 10 47 49.6 & 12 30 49.4 (M87) & 13 25 27.6 & 10 47 42.3 & 01 09 27.0 & 13 13 11.9  & 00 15 31.5\t& 1\\\\\nDec(2000) \t& +12 34 54  & +12 23 28 (M87)  & --43 01 09& +13 59 09  & +35 43 05  & --43 15 56   & --32 10 48 \t& 1\\\\\nType\t& E1\t& cD pec (M87) & Ep & E5-6\t& SA0\t& S0pec\t & dE3\t& 1,2\\\\\n$B$\t\t& 10.24\t& 9.59  & 7.78 & 11.24 & 11.21 & 14.37\t & 14.93\t& 2,3\\\\\n$B-V$\t& 0.96  & 0.96  & 1.00 & 0.86  & 0.94  & 0.9$^b$ \t\t& 0.9$^b$& 2,3 \\\\\n$V$\t\t& 9.28  & 8.63  & 6.78 & 10.38 & 10.27 & 13.47$^b$\t \t& 14.03$^b$ & 2,3\\\\\n$I$\t\t& \t\t& 7.92  & \t   & \t\t& \t\t& 13.25\t & 13.86\t& 3\\\\\n$E(B-V)$& 0.022\t& 0.020 & 0.101 & 0.030 & 0.051 & 0.106  & 0.012 & 1,4\\\\\n$E(V-I)$& 0.030\t& 0.028 & 0.142 & 0.042 & 0.072 & 0.150  & 0.017 & 1,4\\\\\n$A_V$\t& 0.069\t& 0.063 & 0.315 & 0.093 & 0.160 & 0.331  & 0.037 & 1,4\\\\\n$A_I$\t& 0.037\t& 0.035 & 0.173 & 0.051 & 0.088 & 0.181  & 0.020 & 1,4\\\\\n\\hline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\multicolumn{8}{c}{Distance estimation} \\\\\n$I_{TRGB}$ \t\t& $26.02\\pm0.02$ & $26.97\\pm0.03$ & $23.91\\pm0.03$ & $26.19\\pm0.02$ & $23.50\\pm0.02$ & $24.00\\pm0.02$  & $22.37\\pm0.02$ & 5\\\\\n$A_I$\t\t\t& 0.039 & 0.038  & 0.185 & 0.050 & 0.078  & 0.181 & 0.020 & 1,4\\\\\n$I_{0,TRGB}$ \t& $25.98\\pm0.02$ & $26.93\\pm0.03$ & $23.75\\pm0.03$& $26.14\\pm0.02$ & $23.42\\pm0.02$ & $23.82\\pm0.02$ & $22.35\\pm0.02$ & 5\\\\\n$E(V-I)$\t\t& 0.032  & 0.031 & 0.152 & 0.041 & 0.063 & 0.150& 0.017 & 1,4\\\\\n$(V-I)_{TRGB}$ \t& $1.58\\pm0.03$ & $1.47\\pm0.02$ & $1.88\\pm0.3$ & $1.71\\pm0.03$ & $1.66\\pm0.02$ & $1.71\\pm0.02$ & $1.43\\pm0.02$ & 5\\\\\n$M_{I,TRGB}$ \t& --4.06 & --4.09 & --4.02 & --4.04 & --4.04 & --4.06 & -4.09 & 5\\\\\n$(m-M)_0$ \t\t& $30.04\\pm0.02$ & $31.02\\pm0.03$ & $27.75\\pm0.03$ & $30.18\\pm0.02$ & $27.46\\pm0.02$ & $27.88\\pm0.02$  & $26.44\\pm0.02$ & 5\\\\\n\\hline\n$M_V$ \t\t\t& --20.83 & --22.45  & --21.29 & --19.89 & --17.35 & --14.74 & --12.45 & 5 \\\\\n\\enddata\n\\tablenotetext{a}{The Virgo core field is located at about $40\\arcmin$ ($\\sim$30 $R_{\\rm eff}$) from the center of M87 (see {\\bf Figure 1} in \\citet{jan14}).

NGC 5128  (Ep, $M_V=-21.29$) is 0.5 mag  brighter than M105. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, we selected a field close to the Virgo center where there are no bright galaxies (called the Virgo core field). This  field is located at about $40\\arcmin$ ($\\sim$30 $R_{\\rm eff}$) from the center of M87 (see {\\bf Figure 1} in \\citet{jan14}). \nThis field is far from nearby bright galaxies (including M87, M86 and M84), representing an intracluster field close to the Virgo center. \n\\citet{wil07} presented a study of the intracluster stars in this field based on the HST F606W and F814W imaging. \n\nThey  suggested in the study of resolved stars in the Virgo core field that the population younger than 10 Gyr is more metal-rich than that older than 10 Gyr. They used Starfish CMD model fitting \\citep{har01} and the isochrones given by \\citet{gir02} to derive the star formation history in this field. They found that this field is dominated by low metallicity old stars, but includes a small fraction of younger popoulation with high metallicity. Thus the MDF of this field we derived with 12 Gyr isochrones may be affected by the presence of younger population in this field, but the effect may be minor.\n\n\nA summary of HST data and basic properties of these galaxies are listed in {\\bf Table \\ref{tab_4gallog}} and {\\bf \\ref{tab_4gal}}.\n\nWe obtained photometry of the resolved stars in each galaxy from the F606W and F814W images in the HST archive, using the same procedures as done for M105. \nWe determined the distances to these galaxies using the TRGB method. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig11.eps} \n\\caption{$M_I - (V-I)_0$ CMDs of the resolved stars in the Virgo Core Field, \nNGC 5218 (Ep, $M_V=-21.29$), NGC 3377 (E5, $M_V=-19.89$), NGC 404 (S0, $M_V=-17.35$), NGC 5011C (S0, $M_V=-14.74$), and ESO410-005 (dE3, $M_V=-12.45$).\nRed solid lines represent 12 Gyr isochrones for [$\\alpha$/Fe]=+0.2 and a range of metallicity ([M/H] = --2.2 to +0.4) with a step of 0.2 from left to right in the Dartmouth models \\citep{dot08}.} \n\\label{fig_cmdcomp} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{fig12.eps} \n\\caption{A comparison of MDFs of the resolved RGB stars in M105, the Virgo Core Field, \nNGC 5128 (Ep, $M_V=-21.29$), \nNGC 3377 (E5, $M_V=-19.89$), \nNGC 404 (S0, $M_V=-17.35$), \nNGC 5011C (S0, $M_V=-14.74$), and ESO410-005 (dE3, $M_V=-12.45$).\nThe filled and hatched histograms \nrepresent the MDFs before and after completeness correction, respectively.\nCompleteness corrections for other MDFs are negligible, as shown by their CMDs.} \n\\label{fig_mdfcomp} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_cmdcomp}} displays the CMDs of the resolved stars in these galaxies and the Virgo core field .

Both MDFs show two major components and their peak positions are similar ([M/H] $\\approx -1.2$ and --0.1, respectively). \nThis shows that the outer field of massive galaxies and intracluster field close to the center of galaxy clusters may share a similar history of growing. \nThe existence of the significant metal-rich component with [M/H] $\\approx -0.1$ in both the outer halo of M105 and the Virgo core field implies that a significant fraction of the progenitors for the stars in these low density regions are massive galaxies (as massive as M105).\n\nSecond, \nthe peak metallicity of the high metallicity component in each galaxy is higher for brighter galaxies, consistent with the results in \\citet{har07a}.\n\nThird, \nthe peak metallicity of the metal-poor component in M105\n(as well as in the Virgo core field)  is similar to that of\nNGC 5011C ($M_V = -14.7$ mag). This implies that the progenitors of these metal-poor components are probably dwarf galaxies with $M_V = -14$ to --15 mag.\n\nFourth, \n\nthe progenitors of the metal-poor stars at the very low metallicity tail ([M/H]$<-1.5$) in M105 are, in part, fainter dwarf galaxies with $M_V >-12.0$ mag (dSphs and UFDs). Some of them may have come from the early stages of star formation in the central galaxy.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Dual Stellar Halos and Formation of Massive ETGs}\n\n\n\n\nKey results found in this study are\n1) that the MDF of the bright RGB stars in the large range of galactocentric distance of M105 is  bimodal, \n2) that the metal-poor component is getting more dominant in the outer region of a galaxy,\n3) that the radial number density profiles of the metal-rich and metal-poor stars in M105 are significantly different in the outer region,\n4) that the radial number density profiles of the metal-rich and metal-poor stars in M105\n\nare fitted well by the Sersic law with $n\\approx 2.8$ and $n\\approx 6.9$, respectively,\n5) that the peak metallicity of the metal-rich component in the outer halo of M105\n  is similar to that of  the Virgo core field,\n6) that the peak metallicity of the metal-poor component in M105\n(as well as in the Virgo core field)  is similar to that of\nNGC 5011C ($M_V = -14.7$ mag), and \n\n\n7) that the progenitors of the metal-poor stars at the low metallicity tail ([M/H] $<-1.5$) in M105 are \npossibly fainter dwarf galaxies with $M_V >-12.0$ mag (dSphs and UFDs).\n\n\n\n\nThese results indicate that there are two distinct stellar halos in massive ETGs like M105: a metal-poor (blue) halo and a metal-rich (red) halo. The metal-rich halo is dominant in the inner region, while the metal-poor halo is more distinguishable in the outer region.\n \\citet{har07b} found the existence of a distinguishable blue RGB  in the study of the same outer field as used in this study,  \n and predicted that \"large E/S0 galaxies\nin general will have diffuse, very low-metallicity halo components, but that photometry at radii ($R \\sim  (10-15) R_{\\rm eff} $) will be necessary to find them''. \nSince then these diffuse low-metallicity halo components have been found in the outer regions of a few E/S0 galaxies.\n\n\n\nThe existence of dual stellar halos in massive ETGs \nis consistent\nwith the prediction based on the globular cluster systems\nin ETGs \\citep{par13}: massive ETGs may have often dual halos, one blue (metal-poor) halo and one red (metal-rich)  halo. \nConsidering the properties of red and blue globular cluster systems in massive ETGs, \\citet{par13} suggested a dual halo scenario for how massive ETGs formed.\n Massive ETGs are formed in two main modes: a metal-rich halo mode and a metal-poor halo mode. \n\n\n\n\n\nWe provide an updated scenario, including the information we found from the stellar halos in this study. \n{\\bf Figure \\ref{fig_scenario}} \nillustrates a schematic view of the main features of this scenario. \nThis scenario is based on the concept of hierarchical merging models for structure formation (\\citet{cot98, del07,con14,coo15,hir15,som15} and references therein), focusing on the observational results on the properties of the resolved stars and globular clusters in ETGs.\nAll galaxies should have different formation histories, because they start with progenitors with different masses and are involved with diverse histories of merging. \nHowever, considering the bimodality of the MDFs of the resolved stars in ETGs, we can divide the formation modes roughly into two: a metal-rich halo mode and a metal-poor mode.\n\nIn the metal-rich halo mode, metal-rich halos formed in two phases. \nIn the first phase, during the early phase of the universe, progenitors of today's massive galaxies formed via rapid collapse of massive protogalactic clouds (in situ formation of stars) \\citep{egg62} and/or major mergers, while a much larger number of low mass galaxies and globular clusters formed via collapse of low mass clouds embedded in low mass dark matter halos mostly around the massive galaxies \\citep{sea78, whi78}. These two processes (in situ collapse and major mergers) in the massive progenitors are not independent, but both can happen in the same galaxy with a small time lag. Major mergers can be either wet or dry and they can be involved also with several mergers.\nIn this mode, the MDF of the stars in the massive galaxies will show a dominant metal-rich component with a weak tail in the low metallicity end, as described in classical chemical evolution models. The larger the masses of the most massive progenitors are, the higher the peak values of the stellar metallicity are. The structure, color, and luminosity of the resulting galaxies are dominated by the metal-rich stars. \n\nIn the second phase, the metal-rich halos grow mostly via merging with intermediate mass galaxies that have metallicities higher than those of dwarf galaxies. \nThe MDFs in the resulting galaxies will be broader toward the low metallicity. They will be involved with numerous merging with low-mass/dwarf galaxies as well, but it will contribute only a minor role in increasing the mass and size of the metal-rich halos.  Thus the metal-rich halos  formed and evolve in two phases, being dominated by metal-rich stars.\n\nIn the metal-poor halo mode, metal-poor halos grow mainly via accretion or minor mergers of dwarf galaxies for long duration. The outstanding existence of a distinct blue (metal-poor) RGB in the outer region of massive galaxies shows that they are not the low metallicity tail of the main population (the metal-rich halo), but they have a distinct origin. The origin of the metal-poor stars is considered to be accreted dwarf galaxies that have mainly low metallicity stars with [M/H]$<-1.0$. Some brighter dwarf galaxies like NGC 5011C ($M_V \\sim -15.0$ mag) produce the metal-poor component peak at  [M/H]$\\sim -1.2$.\nAmong the dwarf galaxies, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are one of the strong candidates for the low metallicity tail at [M/H]$<-1.5$.\nUFDs have been found mostly in the Local Group \\citep{bel13}. \n\nThe stellar populations in several nearby UFDs in the Local Group \\citep{bro14} and the Virgo cluster \\citep{jan14} are known to be old and metal-poor, consistent with the halo stars in the low metallicity tail in M105. \nThese dwarfs are accreted in the outer region of a galaxy, contributing to the growth of the metal-poor halo. Thus the accreted stars in the metal-poor halo must be very old, although they join the metal-poor halo during the long period.  \nThe number density of the metal-poor stars is very low so that\nthey make only a minor contribution to the luminosity of the galaxies.\nHowever, they contain critical clues to understand how and when the outer halo formed and to study the distribution of the dark matter.\n\nThis dual halo mode scenario, mainly based on observational results of resolved red giants and globular clusters in nearby galaxies, is consistent with the two-phase scenario derived from high-resolution cosmological simulations  (\\citet{ose10, ose12,hir15} and references therein). \nIn the first phase of this scenario, compact cores of massive galaxies form rapidly via in-situ star formation associated with cold flows and/or gaseous mergers early at $2<z<6$.\nThese compact massive galaxies will have, on average, \n$M\\approx 10^{11} M_\\odot$, $R_{\\rm eff} \\approx 1$ kpc, and $\\sigma_v  \\approx 240$ {km s$^{-1}$} , around the end of this phase, and they will show disk-like structures flatter than today's ETGs.\n\nThen in the second phase, these compact massive galaxies get bigger mainly via minor dry merging. The effective radii of these galaxies grow significantly faster in size than in mass as a result of conservation of angular momentum, and they will have lower velocity dispersion in the central region. As time goes on, these galaxies will have larger outer envelopes, which  also grow in mass, occupying a major fraction of mass in more massive galaxies. However, note that there are other views in the literature.\n\nFor example, noting the abundance of compact massive bulges in nearby disk galaxies, \\citet{gra15} concluded that not all compact massive galaxies at high redshift grow dramatically in size.  Instead some of them keep their compactness, being embedded in disks that grow slowly for long.\n\nThis scenario has been successful in explaining several observational results on the integrated properties of galaxies \\citep{ose12}. \nThe results on the resolved stars in M105 and other ETGs in this study provide another strong constraint to test the formation scenarios based on cosmological simulations. In particular the bimodal MDFs of the resolved stars in ETGs including these galaxies need to be considered in the future simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Summary and Conclusion}\n\nUsing deep photometry of the resolved stars in the large range of galactocentric distance (\n\n$3 R_{\\rm eff}  \\lesssim R  \\lesssim 13 R_{\\rm eff}$) of M105, a standard elliptical galaxy, we provided strong evidence  that there are two subpopulations of RGB stars in this galaxy and investigated their structure and MDFs. We also presented the MDFs of the bright RGB stars in other nearby ETGs with a range of luminosity as well as in the Virgo core field derived using the same procedures as used for M105. Then we described the MDFs of M105 using the chemical evolution models, and discussed the implications of the results in terms of the dual halo mode formation scenario to explain how massive ETGs formed. \nPrimary results are summarized as follows.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item The resolved stars in M105 are mostly RGB stars.\nWe measured the TRGB magnitudes  using an edge-detection method for the inner and outer region, obtaining $I_{\\rm TRGB}=26.02\\pm0.02$. From the mean of the inner and outer regions, we obtain a distance modulus \n$(m-M)_0=30.05\\pm0.02 ({\\rm random})\\pm0.12 ({\\rm systematic})$. This confirms that M105 is a member of the Leo I Group.\n\n\\item The bright RGB stars in the CMDs and their color distributions show the existence of two distinct subpopulations: a strong red RGB with a broad color range and a weaker blue RGB with a narrower color range. \n\n\\item We derived metallicities of the bright RGB stars from the comparison of their photometry with theoretical isochrones for 12 Gyr age.\nThe MDF of the RGB stars  in M105 also shows the existence of two distinct subpopulations: a dominant metal-rich population (with a peak at [M/H]$\\sim0.0$) and a much weaker metal-poor population  (with a peak at [M/H]$\\sim-1.1$).\n\n\\item We divided the bright RGB stars into two groups according to their metallicity: a metal-poor one ($-2.4<$[M/H]$\\leq-0.7$) and a metal-rich one ($-0.7<$[M/H]$\\leq+0.5$). The radial number density profile of the metal-rich RGB stars is significantly steeper than that of the metal-poor RGB stars in the outer region, while the slopes of both are similar in the inner region.\nThe number density of the metal-rich stars is much higher than that of the metal-poor stars in the inner region at $R<12\\arcmin$, but becomes lower thereafter.\nThe  radial number density profiles of the metal-rich and metal-poor RGB stars in the entire range of galactocentric distance are fit well by a S\\'ersic law \nwith  $n=2.75\\pm0.10$  and  $n=6.89\\pm0.94$, \n\n\nrespectively. \n\n\nThey are also fit by a single power law:\n$\\sigma \\propto R^{-3.83\\pm0.03}$ for the metal-rich stars and $\\sigma \\propto R^{-2.58\\pm0.03}$ for the metal-poor stars.\n\\item\n\nThe MDFs of both the inner region and the outer region can be described remarkably well by accreting gas models of chemical evolution with two components, a metal-rich one and a metal-poor one. The peak metallicity of the metal--rich component in the inner region is only 0.1 dex higher than that for the outer region.\nThe metal-poor components also show a similar trend.\nThe radial gradient of the metallicity between the two regions is dominated by the population mixture, rather than by the continuous change of the peak metallicity. \n\n\\item \nThese results provide strong evidence that there are two types of stellar halos in M105: a metal-poor (blue) and a metal-rich (red) halo. \nThis is consistent with the prediction in the dual halo scenario based on the spatial distribution of the globular clusters in bright ETGs by \\citet{par13}.\n\n\\item Comparing the MDFs of the resolved stars in M105 with those of the resolved stars in faint to bright ETGs and in the intracluster field of the Virgo core, we suggested a dual halo mode scenario for the formation of massive ETGs.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\bigskip\nThe authors are thankful to anonymous referee for her/his useful comments which improved significantly our original manuscript.\nThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea Government (MSIP) (No. 2012R1A4A1028713). \nThis paper is based on image data obtained from the Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (MAST).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\n\n\n\\bibitem[Belokurov(2013)]{bel13} Belokurov, V.\\ 2013, NewAR, 57, 100 \n\n\n\n\n\\bibitem[Bird et al.(2015)]{bir15} Bird, S.~A., Flynn, C., \nHarris, W.~E., \\& Valtonen, M.\\ 2015, \\aap, 575, 72 \n\\bibitem[Bose \\& Kumar (2014)]{bos14}Bose, S., \\& Kumar, B. 2014, \\apj, 782, 98 \n\\bibitem[Brodie \n\\& Strader(2006)]{bro06} Brodie, J.~P., \\& Strader, J.\\ 2006, \\araa, 44, 193 \n\n\\bibitem[Brown et al.(2014)]{bro14} Brown, T.~M., Tumlinson, \nJ., Geha, M., et al.\\ 2014, \\apj, 796, 91 \n\n\\bibitem[Busarello et al.(1996)]{bus96} Busarello, G., Capaccioli, M., D'Onofrio, M., et al.\\ 1996, \\aap, 314, 32  \n\n\\bibitem[Capaccioli et al.(1990)]{cap90} Capaccioli, M., \nHeld, E.~V., Lorenz, H., \\& Vietri, M.\\ 1990, \\aj, 99, 1813 \n\n\n\n\n\\bibitem[Cappellari et al.(2013)]{cap13} Cappellari, M., \nMcDermid, R.M., Alatalo, K. \net al.\\ 2013, \\mnras, 432, 1862 \n\n\n\n\n\n\\bibitem[Chaboyer et al.(1999)]{cha99}Chaboyer, B., Green, R.G., \\& Liebert, J. 1999, \\aj, 117, 1360 \n\\bibitem[Ciardullo et al.(1993)]{cia93} Ciardullo, R., \nJacoby, G.~H., \\& Tonry, J.~L.\\ 1993, \\apj, 419, 479 \n\n\\bibitem[Ciardullo et al.(2002)]{cia02} Ciardullo, R., \nFeldmeier, J.~J., Jacoby, G.~H., et al.\\ 2002, \\apj, 577, 31 \n\n\n\n\\bibitem[Contini et al.(2014)]{con14}Contini, E., De Lucia, G., Villalobos, A., Borgani, S. 2014, \\mnras, 437, 3787 \n\n\\bibitem[Cooper et al.(2015)]{coo15}Cooper, A.P., Parry, O.H., Lowing, B.
