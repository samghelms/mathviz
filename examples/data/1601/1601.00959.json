The spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations are shown in  Fig.~\\ref{correlations_24sites}. The spin-spin correlations decay quite fast, consistent with some kind of spin liquid, and the dimer-dimer correlations are consistent with a plaquette phase on the honeycomb lattice (see for instance the discussion of the SU(3) case in Ref.~[\\onlinecite{Corboz13_su3hc}]). \n\nAs an additional test, we have determined the spatial quantum numbers of the first excited doublet by applying one of the two elementary translations of the lattice. The corresponding eigenstates belong to the two $K$ points in the Brillouin zone. The correlations in these states are very similar to those in the ground state, which suggests that these three states could correspond to the degenerate ground state of the thermodynamic limit split by finite size effects. To demonstrate that this is the case, we have constructed the symmetric sum of these states, which corresponds to the finite-size approximation of a broken symmetry state (a simple task since the numerical wave functions are real and not complex). In that state, the strong bonds correspond to a covering of the lattice with hexagons (see inset of Fig.~\\ref{ED_24sites}(b)), with a difference between strong and weak bond energies of $0.25$, in good agreement with the extrapolated iPEPS estimate (see below Fig. \\ref{PEPS}(c)).\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Fig3}\n\\caption{iPEPS results for the SU(6) Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice.

The accuracy of the ansatz can be systematically controlled by the bond dimension $D$ of the auxiliary indices. For the experts we note that the contraction of the tensor network is performed using a variant~\\cite{corboz2011,corboz14_tJ} of the corner-transfer matrix method,~\\cite{nishino1996, orus2009-1} and the optimization is done by an imaginary time evolution using a combined simple and (fast-) full update.~\\cite{corboz2010, phien15} To increase the efficiency of the simulations we make use of abelian symmetries.~\\cite{singh2010,bauer2011} A similar approach has been used in previous calculations of SU($N$) Heisenberg models, see e.g. Refs.~\\onlinecite{Corboz13_su3hc,Corboz12_su4}.

As initial states we started either from completely random tensors or from a plaquette state made of SU(6) singlets on  hexagons. \nIn the former case, using bond dimensions up to $D=24$, a new competing state appears, in which each site in the unit cell exhibits a different dominant color. \nFor $D\\leq 24$ this color ordered state has a lower variational energy than the plaquette state, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{PEPS}(a). However, the slope in $1/D$ is larger for the plaquette state. So we have pushed the calculation to very large values of $D$, up to $D=36$. Around $D=30$ the energies of the two ordered states indeed cross such that the plaquette state clearly becomes energetically favored. We have not found a competing uniform chiral state with iPEPS which is an indication that at least for the bond dimensions studied here the plaquette state is the lowest energy state, consistent with the VMC result. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{PEPS}(b) we present the results for the color-order parameter of the two competing states, given by the local moment\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 3969, "prevtext": "\n\\title{SU(6) Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice: competition between plaquette and chiral order}\n\\date{\\today} \n\n\\author{Pierre Nataf}\n\\affiliation{Institute of Theoretical Physics, Ecole Polytechnique F\\'ed\\'erale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland}\n\\author{Mikl\\'os Lajk\\'o}\n\\affiliation{Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa 277-8581, Japan}\n\\author{Philippe Corboz}\n\\affiliation{University of Amsterdam, Faculty of Science ITF, NL-1090 GL Amsterdam}\n\\author{Andreas M.

Several remarkable ground state properties have been reported, including long-range color order,\\cite{toth2010} algebraic correlations,\\cite{Corboz12_su4} translational symmetry breaking valence-bond solid states in which groups of $N$ atoms form local singlets on plaquettes,\\cite{CorbozSimplex2012,Corboz13_su3hc} and chiral ground states, suggested by Hermele {\\it et al.}\\cite{hermele2009,HermeleGurarie2011} for Mott insulators on square lattice with several particles per site. Interestingly, a mean-field calculation even predicted a chiral spin liquid in the SU(6) Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice with only one particle per site.\\cite{SzirmaiG2011}\nHowever, the rather natural plaquette state in which six SU(6) spins form singlets\non nonadjacent hexagons was found to lie very close in energy. \nSo this result calls for further investigation with methods that go beyond mean-field theory.\n\nIn this paper, we have attacked this problem with state-of-the-art numerical methods: exact diagonalizations (ED), infinite projected entangled pair states simulations (iPEPS), and variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulations based on Gutzwiller projected wave functions. As could be expected from the quasi-degeneracy of the mean-field results, it turned out to be very difficult to solve the problem, and all methods had to be pushed to their limit to reach a definitive conclusion, but each method led independently to the same conclusion that the ground state is actually a plaquette state. The chiral state is not far in parameter space however, and it does not take a large ring-exchange term to stabilize it, as demonstrated by ED and VMC.\n\nThe SU(6) Heisenberg model is defined by the Hamiltonian \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{H}=\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} P_{ij},\n\\label{eqn:HamP2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathcal{H}=\\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle}P_{ij},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u210b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow></munder><msub><mi>P</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00959.tex", "nexttext": "\n\naveraged over all sites in the unit cell, where $S_\\alpha^\\beta = |\\alpha\\rangle\\langle \\beta|$ are the SU(6) spin operators and $\\alpha,\\beta$ run over all local basis states. For the color-ordered state $m$ is large for low $D$. It decreases with increasing $D$ but tends to a finite value in the infinite $D$ limit. The local moment of the plaquette state is much more strongly suppressed with increasing $D$, and vanishes in the large $D$ limit, consistent with a singlet without color order.\n\nFigure~\\ref{PEPS}(c) shows the difference between the highest and lowest bond energy in the unit cell which measures the magnitude of the plaquette order. For the color ordered state it is strongly suppressed with increasing $D$ and vanishes for large~$D$, in contrast to the plaquette state which exhibits a large difference in bond energy, where the strong bonds form hexagonal plaquettes. \n\n\n\n\n{\\it VMC:}\n\nGutzwiller projected wave functions \\cite{yokoyama1987,gros1989} offer a qualitative and potentially quantitative description for both types of competing scenarios found by mean-field study.\\cite{SzirmaiG2011} \nIn this method we project out the configurations having multiple occupancy from the Fermi-sea constructed from a mean-field model. The variational parameters are the hopping amplitudes and the artificial fluxes given by their total phase around the elementary hexagons (plaquettes). An importance sampling Monte Carlo method was used to calculate the energies and correlations of the projected states.\\cite{Corboz12_su4}\nOur calculations (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:td_vs_E}) reveal that the lowest energy states are similar to those of Ref.~[\\onlinecite{SzirmaiG2011}]:  (i) a configuration with uniform $2 \\pi/3 $-flux before projection, corresponding to a chiral spin-liquid\\cite{WenWiltzekPRB1989},\nand (ii) a translation symmetry breaking configuration with $0$-flux in a center plaquette surrounded by $\\pi$-flux plaquettes with non-uniform hopping integrals, corresponding to a plaquette ordered phase. \n\nWhile the mean-field results of Ref.~[\\onlinecite{SzirmaiG2011}] slightly favored the chiral phase,\nthe plaquette-ordered phase turned out, after projection, to have a slightly lower energy for all studied system sizes (see Table \\ref{tab:VMCen}), in agreement with the other numerical approaches.  \n\nThe energy minimum for the $0\\pi\\pi$-flux states, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:td_vs_E}, occurs for $t_d/t_h\\approx -0.85$. Now, for $t_d \\leq -t_h/2$, which includes the optimal energy value, the fermionic wave function is gapless at the Fermi-energy: the lowest filled band touches the empty band above it at the $\\Gamma$ point.\\cite{Corboz13_su3hc}.  So, by contrast to the plaquette phase of the SU(3) Heisenberg on the honeycomb lattice, which is described by a gapped fermionic wave function\\cite{Corboz13_su3hc}, the plaquette phase discussed here for SU(6) corresponds to a gapless spectrum before projection, hence possibly\nalso to a gapless spectrum after projection.  Since this gapless point is not protected (the spectrum is gapped for $t_d > -t_h/2$), we suspect that this is an artefact, and that adding additional terms in the fermionic Hamiltonian might open a gap and further lower the variational energy of that state, which is not\nas good as that of the chiral state (see below). However, it might as well be that the spectrum is indeed gapless. This point deserves further investigation.\n\n\\begin{table}[htdp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\n\\hline\n$N_s$&24  & 24 opt & 72 & 72 opt & 288 & meanfield\\cite{SzirmaiG2011}\\\\\n\\hline\nplaquette &\t-1.039& -1.057  & -1.0079&-1.0123& -1.0082\t& -1.010  \\\\\n\\hline\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ chiral &-1.0064 &-1.0104 &-1.0077& -1.0087 &\t-1.0077& -1.025 \\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{VMC energies of Gutzwiller projected wave functions for the competing $0\\pi\\pi$ (plaquette) and the $2\\pi/3$ flux configurations for different system sizes.

We have not found a competing uniform chiral state with iPEPS which is an indication that at least for the bond dimensions studied here the plaquette state is the lowest energy state, consistent with the VMC result. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{PEPS}(b) we present the results for the color-order parameter of the two competing states, given by the local moment\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:m}\nm=\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{5} \\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} \\left(\\langle S_\\alpha^\\beta \\rangle - \\frac{ \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}}{6 } \\right)^2},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"m=\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{5}\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\left(\\langle S_{\\alpha}^{\\beta}\\rangle-%&#10;\\frac{\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}}{6}\\right)^{2}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mrow><mfrac><mn>6</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></munder><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>\u03b2</mi></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03b4</mi><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></msub><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00959.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the sum in the second term runs over all hexagonal plaquettes, and the operators $P_{\\hexagon}^{\\phantom{-1}}$ and $P_{\\hexagon}^{-1}$ permute the configuration on a hexagon clockwise and anticlockwise  (also called ring exchange terms).

Two of these states are at the $\\Gamma$ point, and the remaining four are at the $K$ points, in agreement with the momenta of the six chiral VMC states (discussed below). So, the ED results are clearly consistent with a phase transition between a plaquette phase and a chiral phase upon increasing the ring exchange term. Note that the degeneracy of the chiral\n state is only equal to 6 and not 12 because the Hamiltonian of Eq.~(\\ref{ring_exchange}) explicitly breaks the time reversal symmetry. \n \nThis interpretation is further supported by the comparison with VMC on 24 sites.  To access the low energy spectrum and not just the ground state, we have constructed a large family of Gutzwiller projected states by changing the boundary conditions (BC) of the fermionic wave-functions,\\cite{ZhangOshikawaPRB2012} \nconsidering up to 30 different BCs for the $2\\pi/3$ flux states, and up to 90 for the $0\\pi\\pi$-flux states (30 for each translation breaking state), and\nwe have diagonalized the overlap matrix and the Hamiltonian in this variational subspace.\\cite{LiYangPRB2010,MeiWenarxiv2014} The results are summarized in Fig.~\\ref{ED_VMC_Comparison}. For the chiral state,\nthis parton construction leads to 6 (and only 6) significant eigenvalues of the overlap matrix, which themselves lead to 6 low-lying states very close in energy\\cite{Nataf_SUNchiral}, while for the plaquette states, there is not such a clear cutoff, and the three low-lying states are not so well split from the other states.\nAlthough the variational plaquette and chiral states are higher in energy, their overall behavior is qualitatively consistent with ED. In particular, the energy of the plaquette state is minimal at $\\theta = 0$, while that of the chiral states is minimal around $\\theta=0.36$, and their energies cross around $\\theta=0.16$. \n\nSimilar overlap calculations were carried out for $N_s=72$ sites, with 30 different BCs for the $2\\pi/3$ flux case, and 12 for each translation breaking state (36 in total) for the $0\\pi\\pi$-flux case. The energy corrections for the $0\\pi\\pi$ case turn out to be larger (see Table \\ref{tab:VMCen}), again promoting the plaquette ordered phase over the chiral liquid phase at the Heisenberg point. \\footnote{Note that while the diagonal energies depend on the value of $t_d/t_h$,  the spanned subspace of the projected states with different boundary conditions before projection remains the same, thus the optimized energies are independent of small changes of $t_d/t_h$.}\n\n{\\it Discussion: } To summarize, the numerical evidence clearly points to a plaquette ground state for the SU(6) model on the honeycomb lattice, but \nwith a chiral phase close by in parameter space. Even if it led to the wrong conclusion, the mean-field approach should be given credit for identifying\nthe right candidates with very similar energies.\\cite{SzirmaiG2011} This lends further support to the mean-field prediction by \nHermele {\\it et al.}\\cite{hermele2009,HermeleGurarie2011} of a chiral phase for several particles per site since there does not seem to be competing VBS states too close in energy in that case.  Numerical work along the lines of the present paper to test this prediction is in progress.\n\n{\\it Acknowledgements:}  \nThis work has been supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, the  JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 2503802, by the Hungarian OTKA Grant No. K106047, by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. NSF PHY11-25915, by the Austrian Science Fund FWF (F-4018-N23 and I-1310-N27) and by the Delta-ITP consortium (a program of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) that is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW)). \n\n\\bibliographystyle{apsrev4-1}\n\\bibliography{SU6_refs,refs_PC}\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17923, "prevtext": "\n\naveraged over all sites in the unit cell, where $S_\\alpha^\\beta = |\\alpha\\rangle\\langle \\beta|$ are the SU(6) spin operators and $\\alpha,\\beta$ run over all local basis states. For the color-ordered state $m$ is large for low $D$. It decreases with increasing $D$ but tends to a finite value in the infinite $D$ limit. The local moment of the plaquette state is much more strongly suppressed with increasing $D$, and vanishes in the large $D$ limit, consistent with a singlet without color order.\n\nFigure~\\ref{PEPS}(c) shows the difference between the highest and lowest bond energy in the unit cell which measures the magnitude of the plaquette order. For the color ordered state it is strongly suppressed with increasing $D$ and vanishes for large~$D$, in contrast to the plaquette state which exhibits a large difference in bond energy, where the strong bonds form hexagonal plaquettes. \n\n\n\n\n{\\it VMC:}\n\nGutzwiller projected wave functions \\cite{yokoyama1987,gros1989} offer a qualitative and potentially quantitative description for both types of competing scenarios found by mean-field study.\\cite{SzirmaiG2011} \nIn this method we project out the configurations having multiple occupancy from the Fermi-sea constructed from a mean-field model. The variational parameters are the hopping amplitudes and the artificial fluxes given by their total phase around the elementary hexagons (plaquettes). An importance sampling Monte Carlo method was used to calculate the energies and correlations of the projected states.\\cite{Corboz12_su4}\nOur calculations (shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:td_vs_E}) reveal that the lowest energy states are similar to those of Ref.~[\\onlinecite{SzirmaiG2011}]:  (i) a configuration with uniform $2 \\pi/3 $-flux before projection, corresponding to a chiral spin-liquid\\cite{WenWiltzekPRB1989},\nand (ii) a translation symmetry breaking configuration with $0$-flux in a center plaquette surrounded by $\\pi$-flux plaquettes with non-uniform hopping integrals, corresponding to a plaquette ordered phase. \n\nWhile the mean-field results of Ref.~[\\onlinecite{SzirmaiG2011}] slightly favored the chiral phase,\nthe plaquette-ordered phase turned out, after projection, to have a slightly lower energy for all studied system sizes (see Table \\ref{tab:VMCen}), in agreement with the other numerical approaches.  \n\nThe energy minimum for the $0\\pi\\pi$-flux states, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:td_vs_E}, occurs for $t_d/t_h\\approx -0.85$. Now, for $t_d \\leq -t_h/2$, which includes the optimal energy value, the fermionic wave function is gapless at the Fermi-energy: the lowest filled band touches the empty band above it at the $\\Gamma$ point.\\cite{Corboz13_su3hc}.  So, by contrast to the plaquette phase of the SU(3) Heisenberg on the honeycomb lattice, which is described by a gapped fermionic wave function\\cite{Corboz13_su3hc}, the plaquette phase discussed here for SU(6) corresponds to a gapless spectrum before projection, hence possibly\nalso to a gapless spectrum after projection.  Since this gapless point is not protected (the spectrum is gapped for $t_d > -t_h/2$), we suspect that this is an artefact, and that adding additional terms in the fermionic Hamiltonian might open a gap and further lower the variational energy of that state, which is not\nas good as that of the chiral state (see below). However, it might as well be that the spectrum is indeed gapless. This point deserves further investigation.\n\n\\begin{table}[htdp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\n\\hline\n$N_s$&24  & 24 opt & 72 & 72 opt & 288 & meanfield\\cite{SzirmaiG2011}\\\\\n\\hline\nplaquette &\t-1.039& -1.057  & -1.0079&-1.0123& -1.0082\t& -1.010  \\\\\n\\hline\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ chiral &-1.0064 &-1.0104 &-1.0077& -1.0087 &\t-1.0077& -1.025 \\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{VMC energies of Gutzwiller projected wave functions for the competing $0\\pi\\pi$ (plaquette) and the $2\\pi/3$ flux configurations for different system sizes.
