Single $^{27}$Al$^+$ is one of the most attractions of\nselection system due to its very low blackbody radiation effect\nwhich dominates frequency shifts in other optical clock systems. Up\nto now, the $^{27}$Al$^+$ still could not be laser-cooled directly\nby reason that the absence of 167nm laser. Sympathetic cooling is a\nviable method to solve this problem. In this work, we used a single\nlaser cooled $^{40}$Ca$^+$ to sympathetically cool one $^{27}$Al$^+$\nin linear Paul trap. Comparing to laser ablation method we got a\nmuch lower initial energy (0.63eV) atoms sprayed from a home-made\natom oven, which would make loading aluminum ion more efficient and\nthe sympathetic cooling much easier. The probability of loading\nsingle $^{27}$Al$^+$ is about 80\\%. By precisely measuring the\nsecular frequency of the ion pair,finally the dark ion species,\n$^{27}$Al$^+$, was proved, which could be used to quantum logic\noptical frequency standard.\n\\end{sloppypar}\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{intro}\n\nSingle atomic ions trapped in an RF Paul\ntrap\\cite{Chou03,Dube15,Godun14,Huang12,Rosenband08} and atomic\nensemble trapped in an optical\nlattice\\cite{Nicholson15,Hinkley13,McFerran14} are the most two\nprimary approaches of optical clock experiments. It has been\ndemonstrated that optical clock frequency measurement had a\nfractional uncertainty of 10$^{-18}$ in systems based on\n$^{27}$Al$^+$, $^{171}$Yb$^+$, $^{88}$Sr and $^{171}$Yb atoms\nrespectively.The $^{27}$Al$^+$ clock based on the\n$^1$S$_0$-$^3$P$_0$ transition is stable enough as a reference for\nan optical clock \\cite{Dehmelt82, Yu92}. The natural linewidth of\n$^3$P$_0$ state is 8mHz and the measured transition frequency is\n1121 015 393 207 851(6) Hz \\cite{Rosenband07}, which means\n$^{27}$Al$^+$ has a higher stability at the same feedback velocity\ncompared to other ions, such as $^{40}$Ca$^+$,$^{171}$Yb$^+$ and so\non. Both the $^1$S$_0$ and $^3$P$_0$ energy levels exhibit only a\nweak dependence on the magnetic fields for the Zeeman effect with\nangular momentum J=0\\cite{Hume10}. As well as it is insensitive to\nelectric field gradients. Moreover, blackbody radiation shift of\nthis transition is 8(3)E-18 at room temperature\\cite{Rosenband06}.\nHowever, since it is not easy to acquire the direct cooling laser\n(167nm), $^{27}$Al$^+$ is performed sympathetic cooling with a\nsimultaneously trapped ion and readout spectrum with quantum logic\nspectrum (QLS)\\cite{Rosenband07,Schmidt05}. $^{40}$Ca$^+$ is one of\nthe popular ion species in optical standard and quantum information\nprocessing (QIP). The lasers applied to $^{40}$Ca$^+$ can be\nacquired from external cavity diode laser, which is simpler and\nstability. We choose $^{40}$Ca$^+$ as our frozen species.\n\nSympathetic cooling system includes target and frozen species which\nare interacting with each other. The temperatures of these two\nspecies are very low because frozen species can be laser cooled to\nlow temperature and target species interact or collide with frozen\nspecies to transfer energy with them. Effectiveness of sympathetic\ncooling is with strong dependence on the initial\nenergy\\cite{Guggemos15}. sympathetic cooling is one significant\ntechnique in quantum information processing (QIP)\\cite{Rohde01},\ncold molecules\\cite{Kimura11}, optical frequency\nstandard\\cite{Chou03,Hayasaka12} and chemical reactions at very low\ntemperatures[19].\n\nHere, using a new design of atom oven could generate low velocity,\nthe $^{40}$Ca$^+$ -$^{27}$Al$^+$ ion pair was synthesized rapidly\nand effectively. The mean time of sympathetic cooling by\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ was about 330s, as the low initial energy made it easy\nto be trapped and cooled. The secular motion frequency ratio of\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ -$^{27}$Al$^+$ ion pair and $^{40}$Ca$^+$ has been\nmeasured in our trap, which fitted well with theoretical\ncalculation.\n\n\\section{Experimental apparatus}\n\\label{sec:2} The experiment setup is shown in Fig.\\ref{setup2}. A\nlinear Paul trap was made of stainless steel with a dimension of\n2r$_0$=1.6mm and 2z$_0$=5mm to confine ions. A radiofrequency (RF)\nvoltage at the frequency 17.128 MHz was applied to bladelike\nelectrodes A and the other pair bladelike electrodes B were RF\ngrounded. The endcap electrodes were with DC voltage\n(Fig.\\ref{setup2}(b)). $^{40}$Ca oven and $^{27}$Al oven were placed\nunder the electric shield stage with an angle of 25$^o$ angle to\nprevent calcium or aluminum atom from adhering to the electrodes\nwhich may cause the electric field of ion trap change. The ion trap\nwas enclosed in a UHV chamber (3E-8Pa) evacuated by a 75L/s ion pump\n(Fig.\\ref{setup2}(a)). The external-cavity diode laser of 423nm and\nLED of 395nm were used to photo-ionization of $^{40}$Ca, moreover\nthe 394nm laser served as $^{27}$Al photo-ionization laser. The\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ was Doppler cooled by 397nm and 866nm lasers. The\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ fluorescence was detected by PMT and EMCCD.\nFig.\\ref{setups2}(c) shows the energy level of $^{27}$Al.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\resizebox{0.5\\textwidth}{!}{\\includegraphics {setup2.pdf}}\n\\caption{(a) and (b) is Experimental setup and ion trap.

In experiment only $^{40}$Ca atom signal was detected. The\nrelation between temperature and the current applied to oven have\nbeen measured with thermos couple in vacuum chamber (0.1Pa). The\ntemperature of stainless steel tube oven is only 600$^{\\circ}$C at\n11A current. Since the saturated vapor pressure of $^{27}$Al is very\nlow, the $^{27}$Al must be heated high than 700$^{\\circ}$C the atom\nsignal could be detected. For above reason a ceramics tube oven was\ndesigned to supersede the traditional stainless oven. The oven\nincluded two ceramic tubes and tungsten wire. One ceramics tube was\nspiral winded with tungsten wire. And both embedded in another\nceramics tube(Fig. \\ref{setups}(b)). The temperature of new oven was\nalso measured and the result was displayed in Fig. \\ref{ovens}.\nTemperature of ceramics oven is obvious high compared to stainless\nsteel oven at the same current and the time of heating to\n700$^{\\circ}$C is about 2 minutes.\n\\section{Experimental results}\n\\label{sec:3}\n\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$($^{27}$Al$^+$) was generated by photo ionization\nneutral calcium (aluminum) atom beam, which could reduce the\nimpaction of stray electric field. The specific number of ions were\nobtained by controlling the time of heating calcium (aluminum) oven\nat about 300$^{\\circ}$C(700$^{\\circ}$C). After several minutes later\nthe ions was loaded in the ion trap one by one. It was necessary to\nblock the photo-ionization laser after loading ions because the oven\nwas still with high temperature after shutting down the current.\n\nAfter $^{40}$Ca$^+$ was trapped in the ion trap, the current was\napplied to the aluminum oven and illuminated 394nm laser with\n500$\\mu$W power to insert $^{27}$Al$^+$ to the $^{40}$Ca$^+$ chain.\nThe RF power and endcap voltage must be reduced because the\ntemperature of ions was high at the same time when $^{27}$Al$^+$\ngenerated. Several minutes later the position of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ in\nthe CCD shifted which indicated that dark ion was trapped. The\nnumber of dark ions could be diagnosed by ions distance because the\ndistances of neighboring ions is related to the number of ions, it\nhas no relation with ion species as long as they are singly charged.\nAnd the ions hopped back and forth between different axial positions\nwhen low DC voltages applied to the endcaps. The different positions\nof $^{40}$Ca$^+$ were imaged with CCD, as shown in Fig.\n\\ref{ionchains}. By adding several of such images together, it could\nbe showing the ions at all different positions. And then the dark\nions number is confirmed.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{0.5\\textwidth}{!}{\\includegraphics {ionchains.pdf}}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{6 ions of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ and $^{27}$Al$^+$ mixture ion\ncrystal} \\label{ionchains}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSympathetic cooling process as a sequence of successive Coulomb\ncollisions between the particles transfers momentum from the target\nion to the frozen ion held at low temperature by laser cooling.

The average\ntime of sympathetic cooling was about 330s. In addition, the new\ndesigned oven can also be used to be heat other materials evaporated\nunder high temperature. The drawback of new design oven is that it\nis possible to load more than one $^{27}$Al$^+$ due to unable block\nthe aluminum atom beam immediately. The dark ion mass was\ndistinguished by the ion mass spectrum which was measured and\nanalyzed by using RF resonance and secular motion sideband spectra.\nThe rapid and effective synthesis of $^{40}$Ca$^+$-$^{27}$Al$^+$ ion\npair is significance and necessary on progress of $^{27}$Al$^+$\nquantum logic optical clock in the near future.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgement}\nWe thank for Songbai Kang for the early works, thank P.
