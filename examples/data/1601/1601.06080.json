The\ndependence of the galaxy evolution on the environment in which they are located is proven to\nbe tight. The morphology-density relation \\citep{dressler80} implies that\nthe environment affects the star formation history, color, and\nstructure of galaxies. As a result, the young and active galaxies can\nbe found typically in the cluster outskirts, and the passive ones in the\ncluster core.  The processes concurring to this fast ageing of the\ngalaxies are several.  The ram pressure due to the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) \\citep{gunn72, steinhauser12} builds on the gas present in the\ngalaxy, as it travels through the cluster. The consequent compression\nof the galaxy gas leads to sudden enhancement of the star\nformation (SF) but it also favours the gas removal at later stages. Galaxies can also suffer gas losses via gravitational disturbance.  \\citet{larson80} noticed that the hot gaseous halo of the galaxy is stripped as it enters the cluster environment. This process, called galaxy strangulation,  prohibits further accretion of gas on the galaxy. Furthermore,  the high density of galaxies in the\ncluster environment promotes frequent gravitational\nencounters, that induce the so-called harassment process. The\ndynamical equilibrium of the gas is altered and its collapse is\nfacilitated, due to the perturbation of the gravitational potential. This leads to new bursts of SF and hence further ejection of portion of the remaining gas, due to stellar winds.\nThe efficiency of gravitational encounters to trigger new SF episodes\nincreases in dense environments with low velocity dispersion. Such conditions are found in\nthe filaments, along which the galaxies are funneled and accreted in\nthe cluster (\\citealt{balogh00}; \\citealt{diaferio01};\n\\citealt{okamoto03}).  For example, \\citet{fadda08} and \\citet{biviano11} found a\nhigher fraction of star forming galaxies in the filament of Abell 1763, double with\nrespect to the cluster core and outskirts.\n\\citet{wolf09}, \\citet{biviano11}, \\citet{delucia12},\n\\citet{wetzel13} showed that long lasting encounters are more likely to trigger SF in filaments than abrupt processes such as mergers(see also\n\\citealt{wijesinghe12}). \\citet{haines15} found the specific star\nformation rate (sSFR) of massive galaxies in a sample\nof 30 cluster to be $\\rm \\sim 30\\%$ lower than their counterparts\nin the field. A subsequent modelling allowed to constrain the\nquenching time scale in the range of $\\rm 0.7-2.0$ Gyr, consistent\nwith the characteristic accretion time scale of galaxies in\nclusters. \\cite{peng15} support the scenario in which\nlocal quiescent galaxies with stellar masses smaller than $\\rm10^{11}\n\\,M_{\\odot}$ (i.e. the vast majority of galaxies) are primarily\nquenched as a consequence of strangulation.  To correctly interpret the evolution of galaxies and their accretion history, it is therefore\nfundamental to cover observationally the entire extent of galaxy\nclusters, with the inclusion of the outskirts and the possible accretion structures. In addition, it is important to consider clusters that\ndo not present evidences of ongoing mergers. The intense disturbance\non the cluster dynamics can hide or cancel the effects of the\nenvironment on galaxies and prohibit the study of the secular\naccretion of the galaxies.  A fundamental\ndifficulty in studying these objects is the contamination of\ninterlopers, i.e. foreground and background galaxies. This issue\nbecomes more important at larger clustercentric radii where the\nrelative fraction of interlopers is larger. Therefore,\nspectroscopic redshift measurements are required.\n\n \n\\begin{figure*}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.38\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{coverage_a983}\\includegraphics[width=0.51\\linewidth]{coverage_a1731}\n\\caption{Coverage of IR and optical data for A983 (left panel)\n  and A1731 (right panel).

Robust\nmeasurements of the SFR are necessary, and hence must include both the obscured (via the infrared emission) and unobscured (via the UV and optical emission) star formation activity. In addition, recent studies correlate the presence and the characteristics of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) to their parent galaxies as\nwell as to the environment in which these galaxies are\nlocated. Contradictory scenarios have been proposed so far in the\nliterature, without any clear predominance \\citep{sabater13}. The\ncluster environment allows us to study the duality of the\nenvironmental effects: on the large scale, influencing the gas supply, and on the local scale, regulating the accretion of the AGN via galaxy-galaxy interactions.\n\n\nThe galaxy clusters Abell 983 and 1731 (hereafter A983 and A1731, respectively) are local rich galaxy clusters that we selected as targets for our study.\nROSAT X-ray images of A983 reveal the uniform emission of\nthe ICM, that traces the relaxed and virialised state of the\ncluster. On the other hand, A1731 shows signs of a less homogeneous X-ray surface brightness. However, the shallow depth of the X-ray data does not allow to draw secure conclusions on distribution of ICM. With respect to A983, A1731 presents a higher density of galaxies in the core, with two bright cluster galaxies which are surrounded by smaller objects (see Figure~\\ref{bcg_wirc}).\n\nIn this paper, we present the study of star formation and black hole accretion activity in A983 and A1731. This study is based on deep infrared {\\em Spitzer} observations, near-IR Palomar imaging and optical WIYN spectroscopy. This paper is structured the following way. In Section~\\ref{data_set}, we\npresent in detail the observational program and the data reduction. In Section~\\ref{cat}, we present our matched photometric and spectroscopic catalogue.\n In Section~\\ref{data_analysis}, we present the results of the analysis of our\ndataset.  In Section~\\ref{results}, we discuss the scenario that can be drawn \nfrom our results. In Section ~\\ref{summary}, we summarise the results and \npresent future prospects of the project.

The main details of these observations are summarised in Table~\\ref{obs_a983} and Table~\\ref{hydra_obs}. In the following sections, we introduce and describe the\nobserving strategy and the subsequent data reduction and analysis that\nled to the production of the cluster members catalogues.\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\\subsection{Observations: mid to far-IR with Spitzer IRAC and MIPS}\nA983 and A1731 were observed as part of the Spitzer program 20512 (PI: Dario Fadda). A983 and A1731 were selected\nalong with another cluster, Abell~1763 (\\citealt{edwards10}), as being\nrich systems and located at a similar redshift  in\nregions with extremely low Galactic emission, allowing us to measure the SF from the infrared\nwith a lower limit of $\\rm\\sim 1\\;M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}$ .  Furthermore, these clusters were targeted for being at low redshift ($\\rm z\\sim0.2$), allowing a wide coverage that extends to approximately to 3 virial\nradii.\n\nThe Spitzer IRAC images were taken with the instrument set in mapping\nmode, allowing the simultaneous imaging of the field of view in the 4\ndifferent channels corresponding to 3.8, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 $\\mu$m. Each\npointing of the telescope was dithered three times to allow for the\ndetection and removal of transient phenomena, such as cosmic rays. The\nIRAC images cover 39.2$\\times$39.2 sq. arcmin. on the plane\nof the sky, corresponding to 7.3$\\,$Mpc$\\times$7.3$\\,$ sq. Mpc. The MIPS images were taken using slow telescope scanning, suitable for\ncovering large portions of the sky. Throughout the scanning of the\nsky, the subsequent frames overlap each other, for a more efficient removal\nof cosmic rays.  The motions of a secondary mirror in a cryogenic\nbath, compensate for the oscillations of the telescope during the\nscanning. The MIPS images overlap the region covered by the IRAC\nimages, and extend beyond that, reaching a size of 40.3\n$\\times$55.6 sq. arcmin. (7.5$\\times$10.4 sq. Mpc). In the case\nof A1731, the MIPS 70 and 160 $\\rm \\mu$m present a larger final\nfootprint ( $\\rm \\sim 2880'^2$ and $\\rm \\sim 2700'^2$,\nrespectively), due to a shift of $\\sim$18' that\noccurred to the pointing of the last Astronomical Observational\nRequest (AOR). In the 24 $\\mu$m band, we achieved a flux limit of 0.2\nmJy in 29.9 ks.  Table~\\ref{obs_a983} summarises the main properties of our near-\nto far-IR dataset.  The Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Point Spread Function (PSF) for the\nSpitzer observations is quoted from the IRAC and MIPS Data\nHandbooks\\footnote{\\label{note1}http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/sitemap/}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\begin{center}\n \\hspace{-0.2cm}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{j_histo_a983}\\includegraphics[width=0.295\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{h_histo_a983}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ks_histo_a983}\n \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{j_histo_a1731}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{h_histo_a1731}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ks_histo_a1731}\n\\caption{The WIRC J, H, $\\rm K_{s}$ number counts for A983 (top) and A1731\n  (bottom).

The corrections that were applied\ninclude dark subtraction, cosmic ray correction, detector\nlinearization, flat field application and muxbleeding correction\\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/\\\\irac/iracinstrumenthandbook/1}. The latter artifact consists\n  of an electronic ghosting that can appear on the detector due to the\n  delay of the detector in returning to its ground state, e.g. after\n  the read out of a bright source. We applied additional corrections\nto the BCDs, in order to obtain a higher signal-to-noise (SNR) in the images\nand to avoid false source extraction when running automated software\nfor object detection. The additional corrections follow the procedure\ndescribed in \\citet{fadda06} and \\cite{edwards10}. For the\n  IRAC bands, we corrected for column pulldown, jailbars, stray light\n  and spurious effects of bright sources. We then applied a superflat to the IRAC channel 3 and 4 BCDs. Specifically, each BCD, after masking the bright sources,  was divided by its median value. Then, the median value of all these  BCDs was computed and each original BCD was divided\n by this superflat. This procedures helps in removing background gradient present in the final mosaic. For the MIPS data, we corrected\n  for jailbars, background discontinuities, and pixel distortions. We\n  also applied a superflat and an additional flat accounting for the impurities on the  cryogenic scan mirror. The MIPS astrometry was corrected by extracting the position of the sources in sets of 25 consecutive frames and matching them to the SDSS DR10 r'-band catalogue  \\citep{ahn14}.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccccc}\n\\hline\nCluster& Instrument & $\\lambda_{cent}$ [$\\mu$m] &  Date & Time [min]& Coverage[$^{\\prime 2}$] & FWHM of PSF [$^{\\prime\\prime}$]\\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\nAbell 983 & IRAC & 3.6 4.5 5.8 8.0 &   2005 Nov 26 & 72.9 (each) & 1600&\t1.66 1.72 1.88 1.98\\\\\n& MIPS & 24  &   2006 May 07 & 498.6 & 2200&\t5.9\\\\\n&MIPS & 70  &  2006 May 07 & 498.6& 2035&\t16\\\\\n& MIPS & 160 &  2006 May 07 & 498.6& 2000\t&40\\\\\n& WIRC J & 1.250 &  2007 Mar 26-27 & 61.0& 1000& 1.3\\\\\n& WIRC H & 1.635 &  2007 Mar 26-27 & 99.3& 1000& 1.2\\\\\n& WIRC Ks & 2.150 &  2007 Mar 26-27 & 67.2& 1000& 1.4\\\\\n\nAbell 1731 & IRAC & 3.6 4.5 5.8 8.0 &   2005 Jun 13 & 72.7 (each) & 1600&\t1.66 1.72 1.88 1.98\\\\\n& MIPS & 24  &  05 Dec 08/06 Jun 12 & 498.6 & 2200& \t5.9\\\\\n& MIPS & 70  &  05 Dec 08/06 Jun 12 & 498.6 & 2880& 16\\\\\n& MIPS & 160 &  05 Dec 08/06 Jun 12 & 498.6 & 2700&\t40\\\\\n& WIRC J  & 1.250 &  2008 Apr 24-26 & 31.5& 950& 1.3\\\\\n& WIRC H & 1.635  &  2008 Apr 24-26 & 31.5& 950& 1.2\\\\\n& WIRC K$_{s}$  & 2.150 &  2008 Apr 24-26 & 41.0& 950& 1.4\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Near to far infrared observations of A983 and A1731.}\\label{obs_a983}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\hline\nCluster & Pointing & Date & FOV Centre [R.A., Dec.

We computed aperture magnitudes using 9~arcsec radius for extended sources and we applied the extended sources aperture correction, following the instruction on the Spitzer's IRAC Handbook, for the galaxies  presenting an evident\nextended\nstructure\\footnote{\\tiny http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/\\\\irac/iracinstrumenthandbook/30/} ($\\sim$1\\% of the total number of sources).\n\n \nThe MIPS point sources were extracted using Starfinder\n\\citep{diolaiti00}. The software allowed us to estimate the PSF\ndirectly from the image, accounting for the instrument design, using\nan iterative procedure. The flux was then measured using apertures\nwith radii of 10, 16 and 20~arcsec for 24, 70 and 160\n$\\rm \\mu m$, respectively. Multiplicative aperture corrections and color\ncorrections were applied accordingly (see\nTable~\\ref{ap_corrections})\\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/\\\\MIPS/mipsinstrumenthandbook/50/}.\nWe checked for the presence of extended sources in the MIPS $24 \\mu$m\nby PSF fitting and removing the point sources from the original\nimage. We measured Petrosian fluxes of the extended sources ($\\sim$2\\% of the total number of sources) from the\nresidual image using SExtractor.\n\n\\subsection{Observations: near-IR with Palomar/WIRC}\n\n\nMeasuring the near-IR emission is essential in order to estimate the\nstellar mass in galaxies. This is because most of the galaxy stellar\nmass is locked up in the evolved population which emits most of its\nlight in the K-band \\citep{kauffmann98}. Therefore, deep observations\nin the near-IR are essential to obtain a robust estimate of the galaxy\nstellar mass.  We obtained near-IR images of the central $\\rm 60'\\times 90'$\nregion of Abell 983 and Abell 1731 using the Wide InfraRed Camera (WIRC)\non the Palomar 200 inch telescope.\n\n\n\n  A983 was imaged during two\n  nights of observations on 2007 March 26-27. The images of A1731 were\n  obtained during a second run on 2008 April 24-26. The nights were\n  photometric, with seeing between 0.9 and 1.4\" (see Table\\ref{obs_a983}. Figure~\\ref{bcg_wirc} shows the Ks images of the cluster central regions and  Figure~\\ref{coverage} shows the footprints of the instrument.  The observing\n  strategy for the two runs was different. To observe A983, we scanned\n  the field by moving the field of view along in three strips with\n  fixed declination. The J images were obtained with an exposure time\n  of 40 s. In H and Ks, two coadds of 30 s and four co-adds of 10 s\n  each, respectively, were taken to avoid saturation.  The total\n  integration times for J, H, and Ks were 61, 99, and 67 minutes,\n  respectively. For the second run, A1731 was imaged using a\n  7-position dithering pattern centered on 9 different subfields.  In this case we used an exposure time of 30 s for J and H and\n  three coadds of 13 s in the case of Ks. Hence, the total\n  integration time was 31.5 minutes for J and H and 41 minutes for Ks.\n  Dark frames were also obtained for each integration time.\n\nThe same data reduction technique was applied to all three bands using\na pipeline developed and kindly provided by Tom Jarrett.  A median dark\nframe was subtracted from the data frames, and correction terms for\nthe flux nonlinearity were applied to correct the bias. A median sky made of a maximum of\n10 frames was calculated and subtracted from the data frame before\nflat fielding. The astrometry was checked using a list of known stars\n  from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS;\n  \\citealt{skrutskie06}) and corrected by accounting for\n  the rotational offset of the telescope  and compensating for the distortion of the\n  WIRC instrument. SWarp \\citep{bertin02} was used\nto mosaic the frames together. Flux calibration was performed relative\nto the 2MASS catalog. The magnitude limit that we aimed to reach for\nthese observations was $\\rm M^*+2$, where $\\rm M^*$ is the magnitude\nat the knee of the luminosity function \\citep{edwards10}. For a\ncluster of galaxies at z$\\sim0.2$, a typical value is\n$\\rm Ks^*= 15.6$ \\citep{depropris03}.  The majority of the cluster\ngalaxies, being passive, present typical near-IR color indices of $\\rm\nJ -Ks =1.7$ and $\\rm H-Ks = 0.8$ \\citep{fukugita95}. Hence, our near-IR\nphotometry reaches (at 3$\\rm\\sigma$) a depth of J$\\sim19.5$, H$\\sim18.5$,\nand Ks$\\sim17.5$, extending approximately two magnitudes deeper than\nthe 2MASS archival data (Figure~\\ref{palomar_histo}).\n \\begin{figure*}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{j_a983_final}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{h_a983_final}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ks_a983_final}  \n  \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{j_a1731_final}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{h_a1731_final}\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ks_a1731_final}\n\\caption{The difference between the WIRC aperture magnitudes with the\n  2MASS aperture magnitudes, plotted against the IRC aperture magnitudes, for A983 (top) and A1731 (bottom).

This aperture was chosen to match the one\nused in 2MASS. In Figure~\\ref{2mass_comp}, we present the comparison\nbetween our WIRC aperture magnitudes and the 2MASS ones. We measured a higher dispersion (1$\\rm\\sigma$) of the difference between the two magnitudes at the faint end but limited to about $\\rm3.5\\%$ of the corresponding WIRC magnitude. \nThis value decreases towards higher magnitudes ($\\rm<15$) to about $\\rm2.5\\%$. The\nincreasing scatter at the faint end is also due to the increase of the noise in the 2MASS data, that are close to the detection limit.\n\nWe then proceeded with the measurement of the Petrosian magnitudes\nfrom our mosaicked images using SExtractor. These magnitude, used for the final catalogue, are measured on circular apertures\nwithin Petrosian radii. The Petrosian radius is defined as the radius\nat which the local surface brightness is a factor of 0.2 times the\nmean surface surface brightness inside the radius \\citep{petrosian76}.\nIn order to be able to detect both faint and extended sources, we set\na \\textsl{det\\_minarea} of $5$ and \\textsl{det\\_minthresh} of\n$2.0$. We used a \\textsl{deblend\\_mincont} of $0.00005$ to detect the\nsmallest object that might be close to the largest galaxies.\n\n \\begin{table}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline\nChannel & Aperture & Aperture & Color \\\\\n & radius [\"]  & corr. & corr.\\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\nIRAC1 & 3 &1.14 & ... \\\\\nIRAC2 & 3 &1.14 & ...\\\\\nIRAC3 & 3 &1.25  & ...\\\\\nIRAC4 & 3 &1.42  & ...\\\\\nMIPS24 & 10 &1.167 & 1.041 \\\\\nMIPS70 & 16 &2.044 & 1.089\\\\\nMIPS160 & 20 &3.124 & 1.043\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Aperture and color corrections applied to the IRAC and MIPS sources.}\n\\label{ap_corrections}\n\\end{table}\n\\subsection{Observations: optical spectra at WIYN}\\label{sec_opt}\n\n\n\n\nWe obtained optical spectra of the MIPS $24\\mu$m sources with flux greater than 0.3 mJy and optical magnitudes less than 20.5 in r' band in two\ndifferent runs using the Hydra instrument mounted at the WIYN\ntelescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO). In total, we\nobserved six  and four overlapping pointings for A1731 and A983, respectively (see Figure~\\ref{coverage} and Table~\\ref{hydra_obs}).\n\nDuring the first run on 2006 April 28-30,\n  we obtained spectra of all 24 $\\mu$m sources in A1731. We also\n  observed three WIYN fields of A983 targeting 8$\\mu$m sources since\n  the MIPS observations were not yet available at the time of\n  observation.  During the second run on 2008 Jan 14 we completed the\n  observations of the 24$\\mu$m sources in A983 which were not already\n  observed as 8$\\mu$m emitters by observing a further 69 sources.  To\nobtain spectra between 4000 and 9000 \\AA\\, we used the red cable and\ngrating 316@7.0 at an angle of 21 degrees, centered at 6500~\\AA, and\nintegrated for $3\\times 1200$ s. This gives a dispersion of\n2.6~\\AA\\ pixel$^{-1}$, a spectral coverage of 5400\\AA, and a\nresolution of 5.7\\AA\\. The package\n  \\texttt{DOHYDRA}\\footnote{F. Valdes 1995, Guide to DOHYDRA,\n    available at http://iraf.noao.edu/tutorials/dohydra/dohydra.html}\n  was used for the extraction and reduction of the spectra including\n  the wavelength calibration, application of the flat-field and fiber\n  throughput correction, and the sky subtraction. Cosmic rays were\nremoved using the \\texttt{la\\_cosmic} task \\citep{vandokkum01}. The\nscripts were run for each configuration and for each night. More\ndetails on the reduction methods can be found in \\citet{marleau07}.\nConsidering the available 101 fibers, on average ten fibers were not usable and ten others were assigned to sky observation at each pointing. The number of 24 $\\rm\\mu$m target sources per configuration was less than the number of available fibers. Therefore, these free fibers were positioned on r'-band sources with no 24$\\mu$m counterpart (on average 8 per configuration). We were able to obtain a total of 281 and 406 spectra for A983 and 1731, respectively. Of these, only 10 and 25 spectra, respectively,  did not have identifiable lines or continuum features.\n\nWe added archival SDSS DR10 spectra to our WIYN data. We selected the SDSS sources that are located in the cluster regions and extending up to $\\sim8$ Mpc ($\\rm\\sim 4 \\,r_{200}$) in clustercentric distance. Our aim was to increase the number\nof sources with spectroscopic data at the outskirt of the cluster.  The line fitting was performed with an IDL code for\nboth the WIYN and SDSS spectra. The code includes the Markwardt\npackage algorithm for curve fitting. The region of the local continuum\nis selected by hand and fit with a straight line. The line is fitted on top of the continuum with a Gaussian function. In case of blended lines, the code handles the fit of\nmultiple Gaussian functions. The measured flux corresponds to the set\nof Gaussians that minimizes the $\\chi^2$ value of the fitted\nlines. The redshift of each line is allowed to vary and the final redshift assigned to the spectrum is the mean of the redshift of each line.  The absorption features \n are included in the spectral templates. Due to the level of noise, the fit to the absorption features was possible for only 4\\% of the total sample of spectra. Accounting for the absorption features helps in recovering the total line flux that is otherwise underestimated. This effect is more relevant at the high order of the \nBalmer series ($\\rm H_{\\delta}$, $\\rm H_{\\gamma}$), where the fraction of the absorbed flux to the emission line flux is higher. The $\\rm H_{\\alpha}$ and $ \\rm H_{\\beta}$ lines are dominated by the emission and the absorption accounts for 1\\% of the flux.  In case of the $\\rm H_{\\alpha}$ line, this translates to an average SFR of $\\rm 0.05 M_{\\odot}\\, yr^{-1}$. The emission line fluxes are used to estimate the star formation rate and their\nratio is a stringent diagnostics of the presence of AGN. The average flux density limit that we achieved was $\\rm 10^{-17}\\,erg \\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}\\,Hz^{-1}$.\n\nWe compared our line fluxes to the SDSS photometry.\nFor each WIYN fiber configuration, we measured\nthe r'-band magnitudes using the SDSS DR10 filter response function.\nA two arcsec aperture was used, corresponding to the diameter of the SDSS fiber.\nThese factors were computed for each spectrum with a SDSS counterpart. The median value of this flux correction factor was then calculated and the flux of each spectrum, including those without a SDSS counterpart, was corrected accordingly. This  correction factor ranged from 0.78 to 1.22  for both clusters.\nIn addition, we applied an aperture correction  to each H$\\alpha$ flux measurement. This aperture correction was obtained by taking the ratio of the fluxes extracted from the SDSS r'-band image using a 2 and a 10~arcsec diameter aperture. The latter aperture was chosen as it corresponds to the average size of our sources.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcl}\n\\hline\nColumn & Format & Description\\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n1 & i6 & Catalog Number\\\\\n2 & a12 &R.A.

We retrieved the five optical bands\n\\textit{u' g' r' i' z'} from SDSS DR10, that are needed to measure a stellar mass estimate for each galaxy, using spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting. We also included the near UV (NUV) band\nfrom GALEX, containing the emission from newly formed stars.\nAdditionally, we retrieved the archival WISE 3.6 and $4.6\\mu$m\ndata. These bands were used to check the photometry of the IRAC 1 and 2 channels. The 1$\\rm\\sigma$ dispersion of the difference, with respect to the IRAC magnitude, between the IRAC and WISE photometry ranged from $\\rm5\\%$ to $\\rm3.5\\%$ from low to high magnitudes, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{shiftgap_a983}\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{shiftgap_a1731}\n\\caption{The observed galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift in the\n  range $0.15<z<0.25$, plotted in the clustercentric distance -- velocity\n  space.

The right and left\n  panels correspond to A983 and 1731,\n  respectively.}\\label{members}\n \\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Cross matching of the source catalogues}\\label{cat}\n\nWe produced a final photometric catalogue using as reference the positions of the MIPS\n$\\rm 24\\mu$m sources with a SNR in the first Airy ring ($\\sim$\n6~arcsec) larger than 3. The matching distance used corresponds to half of\nthe first Airy ring (3~arcsec). The matching algorithm associates\nthe position of the $\\rm 24\\mu$m sources to sources detected in the NUV, the five SDSS optical bands, the three near-IR bands, the \nfour mid-IR bands, the other two far-IR bands and the spectroscopic redshift.\nThe spatial distribution of the sources is sparse in the field. Nonetheless, the FWHM of the MIPS $\\rm 24\\mu$m is\nsufficiently large to hide close pairs of sources. A comparison with the IRAC images, which have a higher resolution, revealed that this\nproblem affected only a small fraction of the total number of sources\n($\\rm \\sim 1\\%$). The spectroscopically confirmed members  (see Section~\\ref{sec_members}) of the two clusters were not affected by this issue, since all of them have a unique counterpart in all the wavebands.  Table~\\ref{catalogue_entries} summarises the entries of our\nIR selected source catalogue.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Data analysis}\\label{data_analysis}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The cluster membership}\\label{sec_members}\n\n\nThe\npeculiar velocity of each galaxy  was computed with respect to the mean cluster velocity $\\rm \\bar{v}=\\bar{z}c$, where $\\bar{z}$ is the redshift of the cluster and c is the speed of light. The redshift of the cluster was computed as the mean value of the redshifts in the range $0.19<$z$<0.21$.  We used the shifting gap algorithm, as described in \n\\citet{fadda96} to determine the cluster membership of the galaxies we observed. The\nshifting gap method makes use of both galaxy velocities and\nclustercentric distances.  The clustercentric distance to each cluster galaxy was measured from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). The galaxies were grouped in overlapping and shifting bins of $\\rm 500\\,\\rm kpc $ from the cluster center (or wide enough to\ncontain at least 15 or 20 galaxies each for A983 and 1731, respectively). Then, gaps of $\\rm 1000 \\,km\\,\ns^{-1}$ and $\\rm 800 \\,km\\,\ns^{-1}$ for A983 and 1731 respectively, were searched in the observed galaxy velocity distribution. These gaps mark the separation between the velocity distribution of the cluster members and the external galaxies. This procedure rejects\ngalaxies (interlopers) that have velocities bigger than $\\rm 1000 \\,km\\,\ns^{-1}$ and $\\rm 800 \\,km\\,\ns^{-1}$, for A983 and A1731, respectively. The procedure was iterated until the number of cluster\nmembers converged.  The advantage of this\nstatistical method is the independence from any physical assumption on\nthe dynamical state of cluster. The shifting gap method gives us a\ntotal of 134 and 91 members for A983 and 1731, respectively (see Figure~\\ref{members}). The procedure was run iteratively\nuntil convergence on the number of selected members. As a\ncomparison, we run also the algorithm of \\citet{mamon10}. This code\nevaluates cluster membership from the distance-velocity space, based\non models of mass and velocity anisotropy of cluster haloes obtained\nfrom a cosmological simulation.  This method produced\nus 105 members and 77 members for A983 and 1731. This code outputs estimates for the virial mass, the velocity dispersion and $\\rm r_{200}$, and are quoted in Table~\\ref{cluster_props}. The bias towards late-type galaxies of our sample could lead to an overestimate of the velocity dispersion, as these objects present more elongated orbits with respect to the passive population of galaxies \\citep{biviano04}. All the members selected via the \\citet{mamon10} method are included in the sample selected via the shifting gap algorithm. As the shifting gap method appears to be more conservative in identifying cluster members, specifically at high clustercentric distances, we keep this\nlarger sample for our analysis.\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{bpt_983} \n  \\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{bpt_1731} \n\\caption{Emission line diagnostic diagrams using $\\rm[NII]/H_{\\alpha}$\n  and $\\rm[OIII]/H_{\\beta}$ line ratios for A983 and A1731 in the left and right panel, respectively.

The\nwavelength coverage (up to 16 bands) and the precision of the\nspectroscopic redshift ensure the high significance of the fit. As described in Section~\\ref{sec_opt}, the spectroscopic observations targeted also non IR emitters. For these\ngalaxies, we computed a separate SED fit that included only the bands\nfrom NUV to Ks.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{AGN and star forming galaxy separation}\n\nThe SFR values were retrieved using two different methods, i.e. using\nthe computed luminosity in the infrared bands and the $H_{\\alpha}$\nemission line flux. This two methods assume that the emission is dominated by star formation. Hence,  before we applied these methods, we identified those objects whose emission was dominated by an AGN.  We used three independent\ndiagnostics for the detection of the AGN: the first is based on the\ncharacteristic ratio of  optical emission lines, the second on identifying broad line AGN and the third utilises an infrared color diagnostic.\n\n\\subsubsection{The emission line diagnostic}\\label{agn_el}\n\n\nThe ratio of the fluxes of specific emission lines is useful for\ndiscerning the source of the ionizing radiation causing such lines.  A\nclear signature of an active galactic nucleus is a high value for the\nflux ratio of $\\rm[NII]/H_{\\alpha}$ and $\\rm[OIII]/H_{\\beta}$\n\\citep{baldwin81}, with respect to more moderate values in case of a\nstar forming region. In order to identify narrow-line AGN in our\nspectroscopic sample, we used the diagnostic diagrams of\n$\\rm[NII]/H_{\\alpha}$ versus $\\rm[OIII]/H_{\\beta}$ and $\\rm[OIII]/H_{\\beta}$\nversus $\\rm[SII]/H_{\\alpha}$, applying the selection criterion by\n\\citet{kewley01}. These cuts result from the modelling of starburst\ngalaxies with stellar population models (PEGASE version 2.0),\nproducing the ionizing radiation, and with a detailed self-consistent\nphotoionization model (MAPPINGS III). The AGN are modeled  as $500\\rm \\,km \\,s^{-1}$ radiative shocks \\citep{kewley01}. For A983, we identified 11\nand 6 AGN using the two diagrams with $\\rm[NII]$ and $\\rm[SII]$,\nrespectively. Only two candidate AGN are common to both diagrams. In the case of A1731, we\nidentified 8 and 7 AGN using both $\\rm[NII]$ and $\\rm[SII]$ diagrams, respectively\n(see Figure~\\ref{bpt}). In this case, only one candidate AGN is common to both diagrams. We consider only the AGN selected via the $\\rm[NII]$ as the $\\rm[SII]$ lines (with observed wavelength $\\sim8000$\\AA)  are located towards the end of the observed waveband range($\\sim9000$\\AA), where the sky emission lines dominate. Furthermore, \\citet{kewley06} showed that the $\\rm[NII]$ selection method is more sensitive to low energy AGN. In addition to these narrow line emission\nAGN, we visually identify 5 and 4 broad emission line AGN in A983 and 1731,\nrespectively. Broad emission line AGN present permitted line width in the range $\\rm 10^3-10^4\\,km\\, s^{-1}$, while narrow emission line AGN show permitted and forbidden line width of $\\rm 10^2-5\\times 10^2\\,km\\,s^{-1}$  \\citep{hao05}.\n\n \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{sfr_comp_a983}\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{sfr_comp_a1731}\n  \\caption{The comparision of SFR evaluated from the extinction corrected $\\rm H\\alpha$ line flux and the SFR based on the total IR luminosity obtained from the SED fit.

The sources within the so-called \"Stern\n  wedge\" are tagged as AGN. For each cluster, we find only one AGN\ncandidate (see Figure~\\ref{agn_stern}), not identified  using the emission line diagnostic. In total we identify 17  AGN candidate in A983 and 13 in A1731.\n\n\\subsection{The SFR from the total IR luminosity}\\label{sec_sfr_ir}\n\nThe use of MAGPHYS coupled with our multiwavelength catalogue\n(up to 16 bands from near-UV to mid-IR) ensures a consistent modelling\nof the galaxies, that includes the different phases of the ISM and the\nreprocessed star formation emission.

An underestimate of the corrected flux, and hence of the SFR computed using the $\\rm H_{\\alpha}$, can be seen for galaxies with $\\rm SFR > 30 \\,\\rm M_{\\odot} \\, yr^{-1}$.

In order to properly account for the obscured and unobscured star formation, we added\nthe SFR from the total IR luminosity to the uncorrected $H_{\\alpha}$ emission, following \\citet{kennicutt09}. In the limit of complete obscuration (satisfied in the most active galaxies,  luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies), \nthe SFR was evaluated using the total IR luminosity only. The SFR of the\ngalaxies with optical spectral lines only was retrieved from the\ncorrected $H_{\\alpha}$ emission. \n\n\n \nFigure~\\ref{sfr_comb} presents the $\\rm M_*-SFR$ relation for the\nspectroscopically confirmed members, along with \nthe $\\rm M_*$ and SFR distributions for each of the two clusters.

This difference is evident in the comparison of the clustercentric-velocity plot (Figure~\\ref{members}) of the two\nclusters.  A983 presents the classical trumpet-like shape of the\ngalaxy distribution, with a clear separation between the hosted\nobjects and the external ones. A1731 shows a less uniform distribution of the members. The central high number density of members becomes more sparse  at  a clustercentric distance of about $\\sim 2\\rm\\,Mpc$ $\\rm\\sim 1\\, r_{200}$). The analysis of the peculiar velocity of A1731 galaxy members allows us to exclude the presence of neighboring clusters or recent mergers, as no clear subclumps of galaxies are present. \\citet{haines15} showed that  the accreting objects are supposed to be found at these characteristic radii, comparing the cluster in the LoCuSS survey and the 75 more massive clusters in the Millennium simulation \\citep{springel05}. This might suggest that A1731\nis still actively accreting galaxies from the field. \n\nFigure~\\ref{ssfr_comb} presents the correlation between sSFR, defined as SFR/$\\rm M_{\\star}$, and $\\rm M_{\\star}$. The sSFR quantifies the instantaneous growth rate per stellar mass of a galaxy. We compare our results with the relation\nfound by \\citet{oliver10}. They found a much flatter relation using a\nsample of galaxies ($0.2<z<0.3$) from the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic\nLegacy Survey. This difference can be explained considering the\ndifferent selection criteria of our work (24 $\\mu$m galaxies) and of\n\\citet{oliver10}, that used a $\\rm M_{*}$ selected sample. Therefore, our sample is incomplete at the low mass end. The\ndot-dashed line in Figure~\\ref{ssfr_comb} represents the average expected\nrelation between sSFR and $\\rm M_*$ for a $24 \\mu$m source of 0.2~mJy\nflux density, corresponding to the limit below which our sample\nbecomes incomplete (see \\citealt{biviano11}). This limit was computed using the relation of\n\\citet{lee10} between the $f_{24}$ and $L_{IR}$ at the average\nredshift of A983 and 1731, and the \\citet{kennicutt98}\nrelation. For A983, the slope of the relation is close to the one found by \\citet{biviano11}. A1731 departs from this trend, presenting a higher\nfraction of galaxies with high sSFR. In order to quantify this difference, we selected the galaxies in the mass range $\\rm 10^{10}<M_{*} [M_{\\odot}] <10^{11}$. We selected this interval as the low mass end of our members sample can be incomplete, and the high mass end is affected by intrinsic low number of objects. We performed a t-test to verify the significance of the higher mean value of the sSFR of A1731 ($\\rm Log(sSFR)=0.1\\, Gyr^{-1}$) with respect to A983 ($\\rm Log(sSFR)=-0.1\\, Gyr^{-1}$), finding a low value (0.5) of significance. Therefore, the two distribution are not independent from one another.  Interestingly, we found that $\\sim 50\\%$ of the galaxies in this mass range are located at intermediate clustercentric distances $\\rm\\sim 2-3$ Mpc ($\\rm \\sim1-1.5 \\,r_{200}$), for both clusters.\nThis is compatible with the findings of interacting star forming galaxies at the cluster outskirts by \\citet{haines15}. The newly accreted objects can also present on average higher sSFR values with respect to the cluster galaxies as they are not yet fully affected by the environment and hence have conserved the characteristics of the field galaxies \\citep{cohen15}. Figure~\\ref{sf-1d} shows the 1-D trend of the star forming galaxies, selected to have $\\rm SFR\\gtrsim 2\\, M_{\\odot} \\, yr^{-1}$, with respect to the total number of members for each cluster. A983 presents a lower fraction of star forming galaxies in the central region, that increases and reaches the maximum value of approximately 90\\% at $\\rm3-4$ Mpc ($\\rm\\sim 1.5-2 \\,r_{200}$). Similarly, A1731 presents a central dip in the fraction of star forming objects, but the overall distribution is more flat with respect to A983 and has a higher mean value ($\\rm\\sim60\\%$ for A1731 and approximately $\\rm\\sim45\\%$ for A983). We stress that the outskirts of the clusters are suffering from the lower coverage and lower sensitivity of SDSS data, and therefore might be severely incomplete.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ssfr_comb_983}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ssfr_comb_1731}\n\\caption{The sSFR of the cluster members.

A clear asymmetry is present in the spatial distribution of the spectroscopic members of A1731, extending towards the north-west direction. Within this extended structure, $\\rm\\sim 50\\%$ the star forming galaxies present a value of the sSFR in the range $\\rm -10.5<sSFR\\,[yr^{-1}]<-9.3$, with respect to the remaining fraction that presents $\\rm sSFR [yr^{-1}]\\,>-9.3$.\n\\citet{fadda06} and \\citet{edwards10} pointed out that accreted galaxies\nundergo an accelerated evolution when they meet the denser cluster\nenvironment, experiencing a short starburst phase followed by the\nquenching of their star formation activity. \\citet{cohen14} and\n\\citet{cohen15} find a higher fraction of star forming galaxies in\ndynamically active cluster than in more relaxed ones, by measuring\nstar formation with optical spectroscopic data from SDSS and infrared\ndata from WISE. \nThe lower sSFR in A1731 in half the galaxies at these intermediate clustercentric distances ($\\rm\\sim1.5-2 \\,r_{200}$) could be due to the on-going harassment process, that leads to the consumption of the gas reservoir in the infalling galaxies and the reduction of the sSFR. This extended structure presents the spatial characteristic and the pre-processing evidence \\citep{haines15} of a filament-like structure. Additional spectroscopic observation and X-ray imaging would complement the currently available dataset, highlighting the presence of infalling groups of galaxies or a filament.\n  \n  \\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ssfr_comb2D_983} \n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{ssfr_comb2D_1731} \n  \\caption{The 2D distribution of the sSFR of the members in the central region of \n    A983 (top) and A1731 (bottom).

The passive\npopulation of the member galaxies falls in what is called a\nred-sequence, clearly separated from the more star forming and\ntherefore bluer cloud of field galaxies. We visually selected the\ngalaxies in the red-sequence down to a $\\rm r'=18$. We performed a\nlinear fit of this subsample, and extended the relation to the whole\nsample, applying a 1$\\rm\\sigma$ error cut above and below the fitted\nline. The selected passive population of galaxies is visible in\nFigure~\\ref{cmd}. We compared the density distribution  of the red-sequence galaxies to the distribution of the galaxies selected via the shifting gap method (see Figure~\\ref{passive_dynamic}). Our aim is to verify the match between the evolutionary and dynamical centre of the clusters. A983\npresents a direct match between the evolutionary and the dynamical centre (offset $\\sim 1'$).  A1731 shows a similar offset ($\\sim 2'$),\nalthough presenting less passive galaxies in the central 1 Mpc region ($270$ and $120$ galaxies in A983 and 1731, respectively). The extended structure showed in Figure~\\ref{ssfr_comb2d} does not correspond to any overdense region of the passive galaxies. The scenario of an actively accreting cluster\nappears therefore the most likely.  The dense clump in Figure~\\ref{passive_dynamic} located \n at $\\rm R.A.=201.3$ $\\rm Dec.=58.1$ presents no clear identification. The\nNED archive suggests the presence of a galaxy group in proximity of\nthose coordinates \\citep{mcconnachie09}. The\noverdensity at $\\rm R.A.=199.7$ $\\rm Dec.=58.0$ corresponds to the cluster Abell~1713,\nlocated at z$\\sim$0.14.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The effect of the dynamical state of the cluster on the AGN population}\n\n\nGravitational and hydrodynamical interactions are known to cause the disturbance of the gas content in galaxies. The compression and collapse of the gas in the central region of a galaxy can trigger AGN activity (\\citealt{springel05}, \\citealt{hong15})\nOn the other hand, ram pressure stripping,\nalthough more efficient in depleting the outskirts of galaxies as they\nenter the cluster environment, could influence the inner reservoir of gas\nthat powers the AGN. In\nFigure~\\ref{ir_fraction2d}, both clusters show a dearth of AGN\n in the cluster centre (1 Mpc, $\\rm \\sim0.5 \\,r_{200}$,\nfrom the BCG), followed by an increase at the outskirts ($\\rm 2-4$ Mpc, $\\rm \\sim 1-2 \\,r_{200}$,\nfrom the BCG). At higher clustercentric distances (larger than 5 Mpc,  $\\rm \\sim 2.5 \\,r_{200}$, from the BCG), the clusters present a different behavior, with A983 showing a steep decrease of the AGN fraction, whereas A1731 shows a slight increase (from 10\\% to 16\\%). Both clusters present no significant difference when\ncomparing the cluster central and distant, field-like, regions, but a\nsteep increase in the number of AGN is found on average at about 2 Mpc ($\\rm \\sim 1 \\,r_{200}$)\nfrom the BCG. This result is in agreement\nwith the results of \\citet{haines13} and \\citet{pimbblet13}. At intermediate radii, the frequent gravitational interactions of gas rich galaxies might favour the growth of instabilities in the gas distribution. These  are accreted on the central black hole, causing an increase of its activity. Our\nstudy confirms that the majority of the active AGN are found at\nintermediate ($\\rm \\sim 1-2 \\,r_{200}$) clustercentric distance, where the infalling galaxies\nhave still to be fully processed in the cluster environment. This holds also\nwhen considering the non symmetrical distribution of the members in A1731, indicating a relation between the AGN fueling efficiency and the global density of the \nICM. \nThe dual effect of the cluster environment on the AGN life cycle appears confirmed. On the local scale, the high density of galaxies promotes the instability and accretion of gas on the central black hole. On the large scale, the interaction with the ICM inhibits the subsequent replenishment of the gas reservoir.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{agn_frac1D_983}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\linewidth, keepaspectratio]{agn_frac1D_1731} \n\\caption{The radially binned 1D distribution of the AGN fraction plotted against the clustercentric distance, for A983 (left panel) and A1731 (right panel).

Both clusters are located at\nz$\\sim$0.2 and their members were selected using\nspectroscopic redshifts. The total IR luminosity and $\\rm M_*$ of the\nmembers were computed using SED fitting. The total IR luminosity\nwas used to compute the obscured SFR of the galaxies. Furthermore, the\nspectroscopic follow-up allowed us to obtain redshifts and independent\nunobscured SFR measurements, using the $\\rm H_{\\alpha}$ line flux. AGN\nwere identified using an IR color cut, narrow line flux ratio and\nbroad-line detection, and removed from the SF analysis.\n\nThe distribution of passive population of galaxies presents a density peak in the central region for both clusters, albeit the number of passive objects is twice in A983 than in A1731. A clear difference emerged when\ncomparing the 2D distribution of the star forming galaxies:\nA983 presents symmetric distribution of star forming members, whereas those in\nA1731 were extended\nalong what appeared to be a filament-like structure. \nHigher values for the sSFR were\nfound in both cluster outskirts, at $\\rm 2-3$ Mpc ($\\rm \\sim 1-1.5\\,r_{200}$) in clustercentric distance .  \nA983 showed the typical characteristics of an evolved cluster. In contrast, A1731 appeared to be undergoing a phase of active accretion of field galaxies. The $50\\%$ of members hosted in the extended structure in A1731 presented lower values of the sSFR  with respect to the other members at the same clustercentric distance. This suggested the possible effect of galaxy-galaxy interactions in reducing the sSFR, via harassment and subsequent suffocation, as expected due to the pre-processing of galaxies in transitional environment, such as filaments or galaxy groups.\n\n\nThe activity of AGN depends on the availability of cold gas in the central regions\nof the galaxy, and on the dynamical processes that influence its\naccretion on the black hole.\nThe diagnostics we used allowed us to observe a radial trend of the\npresence of AGN, that were on average found at intermediate\nclustercentric distances ($\\sim$3 Mpc, $\\rm \\sim 1.5 \\,r_{200}$), where galaxy-galaxy interactions are more frequent (\\citealt{balogh04}, \\citealt{gallazzi09}). These results are in\nagreement with \\citet{haines13} and \\citet{pimbblet13}.  \nThe cluster environment appears to have an influence on a dual scale: on the small scale, gas instabilities are promoted due to the frequent gravitational and hydrodynamical interactions, leading to new SF and black hole accretion episodes; on larger scale, further accretion of cold gas on\nthe galaxies is blocked, suffocating the star formation and AGN activity. \nFurther investigations, using both observations and simulations are necessary.  Additional spectroscopic observations and X-ray imaging are required to unmistakably identify the presence of infalling groups or filaments in A1731.  This would help in disentangling the effects of physical processes responsible for the accelerated ageing\nof cluster members.\n\n         \n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referee whose suggestions improved the quality of the manuscript.\nThe authors would like to thank Tom Jarrett for kindly providing his package for the reduction of the WIRC near-IR data.

The value of $\\rm A(\\lambda)$ ranges between 0.5 and 3.5 and its mean is 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The star formation rate from the H$\\alpha$ emission line}\\label{sec_sfr_ha}\n\nWe calculated the SFR from the $\\rm H_{\\alpha}$ line flux (corrected for\naperture and extinction) using the $\\rm H_{\\alpha}$-SFR relation\nderived by \\citet{kennicutt98}:\n\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\rm SFR(H\\alpha) [\\rm M_{\\odot}\\,\nyr^{-1}]=7.9\\times10^{-42} L(H\\alpha) [erg \\,s^{-1}]. \\label{kenn_ha}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\rm SFR(H\\alpha)[\\rm M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}]=7.9\\times 10^{-42}L(H\\alpha)[erg\\,s^{%&#10;-1}].\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>SFR</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">M</mi><mo>\u2299</mo></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>yr</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>7.9</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>42</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">L</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>erg</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
