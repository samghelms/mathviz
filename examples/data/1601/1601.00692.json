Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) survey at Ka-band (8~mm and 1~cm) and C-band (4~cm and 6.6~cm).\nThe observed sample has a bolometric luminosity range between 0.1~L$_{\\sun}$ and $\\sim$33~L$_{\\sun}$, with a median of\n0.7~L$_{\\sun}$. This multiplicity study is based on the Ka-band data, \nhaving a best resolution of $\\sim$0\\farcs065 (15~AU) \nand separations out to $\\sim$43\\arcsec\\ (10000~AU) can be probed. The overall \nmultiplicity fraction (MF) is found to be of 0.40$\\pm$0.06 and the companion star\nfraction (CSF) is 0.71$\\pm$0.06. The MF and CSF of the Class 0 protostars are\n0.57$\\pm$0.09 and 1.2$\\pm$0.2, and the MF and CSF of Class I protostars\nare both 0.23$\\pm$0.08. The distribution of companion separations\nappears bi-modal, with a peak at $\\sim$75 AU and another peak \nat $\\sim$3000~AU. Turbulent fragmentation is likely the dominant mechanism on\n$>$1000~AU scales and disk fragmentation is likely\nto be the dominant mechanism on $<$200 AU scales.\nToward three Class 0 sources we find companions separated by $<$30 AU. These systems\nhave the smallest separations of currently known Class 0 protostellar binary systems. Moreover,\nthese close systems are embedded within larger (50~AU to 400~AU) structures and may be\ncandidates for ongoing disk fragmentation.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{planetary systems: proto-planetary disks  --- stars: formation}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nA significant fraction of stars are found in multiple systems.\nThe frequency of multiplicity is a strong function of spectral type (or stellar mass): most\nO and B stars are multiples \\citep[e.g.,][]{sana2011}, as are about half of all solar-type (G)\nstars \\citep{raghavan2010}, around one third of M stars \\citep{lada2006}, and 20 - 25\\% of brown dwarfs or\nvery low mass stars \\citep{allen2007}, also see the review by \\citet{duchene2013}. \nThus, multiple stellar systems are a common outcome of the star formation process and our physical\nunderstanding of star formation must account for the formation of multiple \nsystems \\citep[e.g.,][]{mathieu1994,tohline2002,reipurth2014}.\n\nMultiple systems are expected to form early in the star formation process when there is \na large mass reservoir available. Multiple systems may form through several possible processes (and combinations thereof): \n1) turbulent fragmentation of the molecular cloud \\citep[e.g.,][]{padoan2002,offner2010,bate2012},\n 2) the thermal fragmentation of strongly perturbed, rotating, and infalling core \n\\citep[e.g.,][]{inutsuka1992,bb1993,boss2013,boss2014}, and/or\n3) the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable circumstellar disk\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{adams1989,bonnell1994a,bonnell1994b,machida2008,stamatellos2009}. Fragmentation\ndue to scenarios 1) and 2) will lead to multiple systems that are \ninitially separated by several hundred to 1000s of AU; direct observational evidence for this\nprocess taking place may have been observed in \\citet{pineda2015}. On the other hand, scenario 3)\nwill form companions with initial separations of 100s of AU or less and there are\nseveral examples for which this process may have taken place \\citep[e.g.,][]{rodriguez1998,takakuwa2012,tobin2013}.\nFurthermore, dynamical interactions in an initially close triple system \n(presumably formed by one of the route mentioned above) can eject one member \ninto a wide orbit, providing an alternate mechanism for the production of wide \nsystems \\citep{reipurth2010,reipurth2012}.\n\n\n\nThe distribution of companion separations in multiple systems can reflect their likely formation mechanism.\nThe characteristic separation for solar-type multiples is 45 AU \\citep{raghavan2010}, but 5.3 AU for low-mass\n(0.5 {\\mbox{$M_{\\sun}$}}\\ to 0.1 {\\mbox{$M_{\\sun}$}}) stars \\citep{fischer1992}. However, the main-sequence field multiple systems have been shaped \nby dynamical evolution \\citep[e.g., three-body interactions, interactions\nwith cluster members]{marks2012}. Therefore the present distribution\nof separations in field multiples is likely substantially different\nfrom their initial separation distribution. This makes it difficult to infer\nthe likely formation routes of multiple systems from the observations of field stars alone, and to\ngain a better understanding of multiple star formation, characterizing the multiplicity properties of young,\nforming stars is crucial.\n\n\nYoung stars are typically divided into four observational\nclasses, Class 0, I, II, and III \\citep[e.g.,][]{dunham2014}.\nClass 0 protostars are considered the youngest \nand most deeply embedded within dense envelopes of gas and dust \n\\citep{andre1993}, Class I protostars are still surrounded by envelopes but are less\nembedded than Class 0s, Class II sources have no (or very tenuous) envelopes and are comprised of a\ndusty disk around a pre-main sequence star, and Class III sources are pre-main sequence stars without\nsubstantial disk emission, but may have debris disks. Note that the Class 0 \ndefinition is not independent of Class I because Class 0 is based on \nsubmillimeter luminosity and the\nClass I, II, and III definitions are based on the near to mid-infrared spectral slope \\citep{lada1987}.\nAlternatively, bolometric temperature ($T_{bol}$) is also used and has boundaries\ndefined for all Classes \\citep{myers1993}; however, the observational classification may not\nnecessarily reflect the true evolutionary state of the YSO due to \nextinction and inclination effects \\citep{launhardt2013,dunham2014}. The expected lifetime in the Class 0 phase is expected\nto be $\\sim$160 kyr and the combined Class 0 and Class I phase is \nexpected to last $\\sim$ 500 kyr \\citep{dunham2014}, assuming a 2 Myr lifetime of the Class II phase.\n\n\n\nMultiplicity is becoming well-characterized for pre-main sequence stars (Class II and III sources)\nwith radial velocity\nand high-contrast imaging techniques \\cite[e.g.,][]{kraus2011,kraus2008,reipurth2007,kraus2012}.\nThe typical statistics derived from multiplicity studies are the multiplicity fraction (MF)\nand companion star fraction (CSF). These measures can be thought of as the probability of\na given system having companions and the average number of companions\nper system, respectively. The MF is defined by \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nMF = \\frac{B+T+Q+...}{S+B+T+Q+...}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"MF=\\frac{B+T+Q+...}{S+B+T+Q+...}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00692.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere S, B, T, and Q stand for the number of single, binary, triple, and quadruple systems respectively. \nThe overall CSF of Class II and Class III objects in Taurus is $\\sim$0.7 \\citep{kraus2011} with the\nfractions of single systems only being about 0.25 to 0.33. In contrast to the more distributed population\nin Taurus, the Orion Nebula Cluster only has a CSF of $\\sim$0.08 between 67.5 AU to 675 AU, about 2.5$\\times$ lower\nthan Taurus for the same range of separations \\citep{reipurth2007}. This reduction\nin companions is thought to result from dynamical interactions in the dense cluster environment that strip wider\ncompanions.\n\nThe multiplicity of Class I protostars, on the other hand, has not been as well-characterized due to their embedded nature.\n\\citet{connelley2008} conducted a near-infrared survey of Class I sources in several star forming regions, finding\ncompanions toward 27 of 136 targets with separations between 200 AU and 2000 AU. At separations between 50 AU and 200 AU,\n\\citet{connelley2009} and \\citet{duchene2007} \nfound 15 companions out of 88 targets. Thus, Class I protostars have CSF of $\\sim$0.36 from\nbetween 50 and 2000 AU and the distribution of separations is rather flat \nbetween 100 AU and 2000 AU, with an increase at $\\sim$3000 AU \\citep{connelley2008}. \nThus, multiplicity is commonly observed toward Class I and II sources,\nbut the distribution of separations does not appear universal for all star forming regions. \n\nThe Class 0 sources remain poorly characterized in terms of multiplicity. \nThis is because these sources are even more deeply embedded than Class I protostars, and\ntheir multiplicity can typically only be examined at wavelengths $\\ga$10 \\micron.\nSince the protostar is obscured by a thick envelope, \nemission at $\\lambda$ $<$ 10 \\micron\\ is typically from \nscattered light and/or shock-heated material in the outflow \\citep[e.g.,][]{tobin2007, seale2008, tobin2010a};\nThus, the multiplicity of Class 0 sources has been characterized \nprincipally with interferometers at millimeter and centimeter \nwavelengths due to limited resolution in the mid and far-infrared.\n\\citet{looney2000} conducted a 2.7 mm survey of 11 nearby Class 0 protostars, finding \nthat all the protostellar sources were in multiple systems with\nseparations between 140~AU and 8000~AU. Most, however, were found with separations $>$ 400~AU \n\\citep[corrected for the updated distance to Perseus, d $\\sim$ 230 pc][]{hirota2008,hirota2011}. \n\\citet{maury2010} observed 5 systems at high angular resolution ($\\sim$0\\farcs4), only finding single sources.\nThey then claimed that there was no evidence for multiplicity in Class 0 sources on scales between 150 AU and 400 AU \n(also corrected for the updated distance to Perseus), based on their non-detections combined with\nthe results from \\citet{looney2000}.\n\n\nMore recently, \\citet{chen2013} used archival millimeter/submillimeter data taken toward Class 0\nprotostars to characterize multiplicity toward 33 systems. On scales between 50~AU and 5000~AU, \n\\citet{chen2013} found an MF of 0.64 and a CSF of 0.91, with\nmost companions being separated by more than 1000 AU. The main limitation of that study was \nthat it was not conducted in a uniform manner in terms of sensitivity or resolution. \nThis is because the data were drawn from archival\nobservations toward various star forming clouds at various distances. The survey had\nspatial resolutions that ranged between 30 AU and 1800 AU with a median of 600 AU. \nHowever, they found 3 multiple Class 0 systems\nwith separations between 150 AU and 430 AU, with a total of 5 sources between 50~AU and 430~AU). \nThis survey was a large step forward in the characterization of wide companions toward Class 0 \nprotostars, but was limited in addressing close multiplicity.\n\nNonetheless there has been some progress in characterizing multiplicity on scales $<$ 400 AU. \n\\citet{tobin2013} found two Class 0/I sources (out of a sample of 3) with companions separated by\n100 AU. Moreover, \\citet{tobin2015} found a companion toward the Class 0 system NGC 1333 IRAS2A separated by 142 AU,\nperhaps the driving source of a secondary east-west outflow observed in this system. \nAlso, \\citet{tobin2015b} found a companion toward L1448 IRS3B separated by\n$\\sim$210~AU. Thus, statistics have been building up for Class 0 sources at \nsmaller separations, but in a slow, piecemeal fashion.\n\nTo make a large stride in the characterization of protostellar multiplicity in the Class 0 and I phases, \na survey with uniformly high sensitivity and high-resolution ($<$ 50 AU) is necessary. This is one of the driving goals\nof the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) survey, undertaken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray (VLA). The VANDAM survey was conducted at Ka-band (8 mm and 1 cm), where the observations\nare sensitive to emission from both thermal dust and free-free jets. Furthermore, complementary\nobservations were taken in C-band (4 cm and 6.4 cm) to characterize the spectral slope \nof the free-free emission. In this survey, we have observed all known protostars in the Perseus\nmolecular cloud (82 Class 0 and I sources plus 12 Class II sources ) in order to characterize the multiplicity of Class 0 and Class I protostars\nwith as little sample bias as possible.\n\nThis paper is focused on the multiplicity results of the VANDAM survey derived \nfrom the Ka-band data only. Several following papers will\nfocus on the resolved disk candidates \\citep{seguracox2016}, polarization results, C-band radio spectra, and full survey results. The sample\nis described in Section 2, the observations, instrument setup, and data reduction are described\nin Section 3, the multiplicity results are described in Section 4, the results are discussed\nin Section 5, and the summary and conclusions are given in Section 6.\n\n\n\n\\section{The Sample}\nThe VANDAM sample leverages the large body of work that has already\nbeen done to identify and characterize the protostellar content within Perseus. \nThe sample of sources we observed and the pointing\ncenters are given in Table 1. Our sample is primarily based on the catalog\npublished by \\citet{enoch2009}, which considered all the available \\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope} \\citep{werner2004}\nphotometry and Bolocam\\footnote{1.3 mm continuum instrument on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory} \ndata taken toward Perseus. \\citet{enoch2009} lists 66 protostars within Perseus, 27 of which \nthey classify as Class 0 and 39 are Class I based on $T_{bol}$. \nHowever, rather than a stringent transition from Class 0 to Class I, we refer to \nsources with 60 K $\\le$ $T_{bol}$ $\\le$ 90 K as Class 0/I objects because the measured $T_{bol}$ has a \ndependence on viewing angle that can make Class 0 sources appear as Class I and \nvice-versa \\citep{launhardt2013, dunham2014}. In addition, Per-emb-44 (SVS13) is also denoted\na Class 0/I because its continuum and outflow properties \nare more consistent with Class 0 objects \\citep{looney2000,plunkett2013}. We have also updated the $L_{bol}$ and $T_{bol}$\nfor the sources published in \\citet{sadavoy2014} that include \\textit{Herschel} \nphotometry. Thus, from the sources listed in \\citet{enoch2009}, we classify 27 as Class 0 sources, 8 Class 0/I sources, and \n31 Class I sources in our sample.\n\nWhile the \\citet{enoch2009} survey still represents the best near to far-infrared characterization published thus far, \nthere have recently been candidate first hydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and \nVery Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) identified by millimeter \ninterferometry \\citep{hirano1999,enoch2010,chen2010,schnee2012,pineda2011}\nthat were not detected in the infrared. Moreover, some of the \\citet{enoch2009} sources that \nwere listed as one source were known to comprise multiple millimeter continuum\nsources \\citep[e.g.,][]{looney2000} and the low-resolution of \\textit{Spitzer} at 24~\\micron\\ and 70~\\micron\\\nprohibited these sources from being identified as discrete objects \nby \\citet{enoch2009}; all these sources, 11 in total,\nwere added to the sample. Many of these Class 0 sources \nknown from millimeter observations, but not detected clearly by \\textit{Spitzer},\n were resolved in the far-infrared by \\textit{Herschel} \n\\citep{pezzuto2012, sadavoy2014}.\nMany of these sources are highly obscured at  24 \\micron\\ and may be analogous to the PACS Bright Red \nSources (PBRS) discovered in Orion by \\citet{stutz2013}.\nWe note that the 70 \\micron\\ emission from the source \nPer-emb-37 has a $\\sim$6\\arcsec\\ position shift relative to the 24 \\micron\\ position.\nThis is due to the source being faint at 24 \\micron\\ and \na nearby Class II source being much brighter at 24 \\micron\\ and shorter wavelengths.\nPer-emb-37 was also identified by \\citet{sadavoy2014} as \na Class 0, while \\citet{enoch2009} classified it as Class I due to the mis-association of 70~\\micron\\ emission\nwith the shorter wavelength emission.\n\n\nWe also examined the \\textit{Herschel} 70 \\micron, 100 \\micron, and \n250 \\micron\\ maps of the Perseus region in an attempt to identify additional\nsources that may have been missed by the \\textit{Spitzer} survey. We found 17 sources that\nwere bright at 70 \\micron\\ and 100 \\micron\\ and these were added to the sample; however, these\nsources are classified as either Class II or flat spectrum \nsources (borderline between Class I and Class II) \\citep{evans2009}.\nIn total, our sample is comprised of the \\citet{enoch2009} sample plus 28 sources additional sources.\n\n\n\nThus, our sample contains all currently known/published Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus region\nand flat spectrum/Class II sources that are bright in the far-infrared. \nIt is possible that there are some undiscovered protostars in Perseus, given that classifications \nfor the entire cloud using \\textit{Herschel} photometry remain unpublished. \nHowever, our efforts to identify bright sources in the \\textit{Herschel} data\ndid not turn up a significant number of new Class 0 or Class I sources. Therefore, the sample \npresented in Table 1 is as complete as possible, given the current knowledge of \nthe protostar population in Perseus. The sample includes a total of 94 targeted sources, \n37 of which are Class 0 protostars (FHSCs and VeLLOs included), 8 are Class 0/I \nprotostars, 37 are Class I protostars (flat spectrum included), and 12 are Class II sources, see Table 1.\nThe sources included in \\citet{enoch2009} are denoted by Per-emb-XX and the additional\nyoung stellar objects that did not have more common names are denoted EDJ2009-XXX \\citep{evans2009},\n where X refers to a number. The sources not included in either of those \ncatalogs are referred to by their most common name.\n\n\nThe range of luminosities sampled is between $\\sim$0.1~L${\\sun}$ and $\\sim$33~L${\\sun}$, with a median luminosity\nof 0.7~L${\\sun}$. The median luminosities of the Class 0 and Class I\nsources are 0.9~L${\\sun}$ and 0.7~L${\\sun}$, respectively. This range of\nluminosities is consistent with the typical distribution of protostellar luminosities observed\nin Orion and the Gould Belt Clouds \\citep{dunham2014,dunham2015}. Therefore, our sample is comprised of\na reasonably representative sample of protostellar objects.\n\n\n\n\\section{Observations and Analysis}\n\n\\subsection{Observational Setup and Procedure}\nWe conducted observations with the VLA in B-configuration \nbetween 2013 September 28 to 2013 November 20 and in \nA-configuration during 2014 February 24 to 2014 May 31 and \n2015 June 19 to 2015 September 21. \nThe B-configuration (also referred to as B-array) has\na maximum baseline (antenna separation) of 11.1 km and at 8 mm provides a resolution of\n$\\sim$0\\farcs2 (46 AU). The A-configuration (A-array) has a maximum baseline of 36.4 km, providing\na resolution of $\\sim$0\\farcs065 (15 AU).\n\n\nFor each source in Table 1 we observed a single pointing toward the coordinates\nlisted. However, the sources Per-emb-21, Per-emb-42, IRAS4B$^{\\prime}$, and SVS13C were located less than 15\\arcsec\\\nfrom another source and one pointing was sufficient. Then the sources, \nEDJ2009-233, SVS3, EDJ2009-173, and EDJ2009-235 were serendipitously detected\nwithin the primary beams of adjacent target sources and we report their detections as well. Observations \nhave been obtained for the entire sample in B-configuration (except for EDJ2009-268),\nand observations in A-configuration have been conducted for all sources detected\nin B-configuration. \n\nThe Ka-band observations were conducted in 8 GHz continuum mode using \n3-bit samplers with one 4 GHz baseband centered at 36.9 GHz and another centered at 28.5 GHz.\nThe full 8 GHz of bandwidth was divided into 128 MHz spectral windows, \neach having 64 channels that were 2 MHz wide, and we recorded full polarization\nproducts. The B-configuration scheduling blocks (SB) were \n3.5 hours in length, observing three sources per SB. Each SB started with\nobservations of the absolute flux density calibrator (3C48), followed \nby observations of the bandpass and polarization leakage calibrator (3C84).\nThe observations were conducted with fast-switching, observing the \ncomplex gain calibrator (J0336+3218) for $\\sim$25 seconds and then the source for $\\sim$75 seconds.\nThe pointing solutions were updated every 50 minutes and each \nsource received $\\sim$30 minutes of on-source integration in each scheduling block. \nEach scheduling block ended with an observation of 3C138\nto calibrate the linear polarization angle; thus, the VANDAM dataset in \nB-configuration has all the necessary calibrations taken to examine\nthe polarization toward these protostars at 8 mm and 1 cm. \nSee \\citet{cox2015} \nfor details on the polarization calibration and results toward NGC 1333 IRAS 4A.\n\n\nThe A configuration Ka-band data were observed with the same spectral setup, \nbut with scheduling blocks that were\n1.5 hr, 2.5 hr, or 2.75 hr in length. The shorter scheduling\nblocks were necessary due to the limited windows for observing Perseus \nduring the A-configuration. The 1.5 hr scheduling blocks \nobserved only 1 source and 2 sources were observed in the 2.5 hr and 2.75 hr \nblocks. Each A-array SB started in the same manner as the B-array SBs\nand we also achieved a similar on-source time. The difference was that we \ndid not observe 3C138 at the end of the SBs and \nrely instead on 3C48 for polarization angle calibration.\n\n\\subsection{Data Reduction}\n\nThe VANDAM survey data were all reduced using the Common Astronomy Software \nApplications (CASA\\footnote{http://casa.nrao.edu}) package \\citep{mcmullin2007}.\nThe data taken in 2013 and 2014 were reduced using version 1.2.2 \nof the VLA pipeline in CASA version 4.1.0\nand the data taken in 2015 were reduced using version 1.3.1 of the pipeline in CASA version 4.2.2.\nThe two versions of the pipeline are found to produce consistent results for our data.\nThe VLA pipeline applies flags generated by the online system, \nas well as at the edge-channels of the spectral windows where sensitivity is reduced. \nThe pipeline then applies standard calibration procedures for\nthe delays, bandpass calibration, absolute flux calibration, and the time-dependent \ngain and phase calibration. We inspected the resulting calibration tables to \nensure proper calibration and that bad/uncalibrated\ndata are not included in the final data products. We first verified the absolute \nflux density calibration accuracy by editing the gain table used as input to\nthe \\textit{fluxscale} task. We flagged the calibrator solutions that were at \nsignificantly different elevations and those with substantial time\nvariation. We then re-ran \\textit{fluxscale} with the edited calibration table\nand compared the flux densities calculated for the gain calibrator and\nbandpass calibration with those applied during the pipeline script. If the \nvalues agreed within 10\\% we accepted the flux density scale \nas-is, when they did not agree (only one SB), we flagged the known bad antennas and reran the pipeline.\nThe overall uncertainty in the flux density scale is estimated to be $\\sim$10\\%.\n\n\nFollowing the flux density calibration check, we inspected the final gain \nversus time table and flagged gain solutions that were discrepant from the general\ntrends versus time. We also inspected the gain versus frequency tables to ensure \nthat specific spectral windows did not have abnormally large scatter. Lastly\nwe inspected the phase versus time tables to identify periods of unusually \nlarge phase scatter or phase jumps. Following the gain table flagging, we ran\nthe \\textit{applycal} task with the \\textit{mode=flagonly} option enabled, \nwhich flags the on-source data with no corresponding calibration data,\nbased on the flagged gain tables.\n\nWe note that our reduction method only applies flagging \\textit{a posteriori} \nand the gain solutions are computed with some bad data. However,\nthere is a large amount of redundancy in the computation of the closure phase \nand gain solutions because the VLA has 27 antennas. To determine\nthe effect of \\textit{a posteriori} flagging versus \\textit{a priori} \nflagging, we imaged a dataset in which flagging was applied after pipeline\ncalibration and then applied the same flags to a raw measurement set \nbefore running the pipeline. The source structure and root-mean-squared \n(rms) noise in the resultant maps were statistically indistinguishable.\nTherefore, we have used the \\textit{a posteriori} flagging method exclusively. The good agreement between these two methods\nis attributable to the redundancy in the data with so many antennas.\nFollowing the application of gain table flags, we split out each \nsource into an individual measurement set, averaging all 64 channels \nin each spectral window to 1 channel for the Ka-band data.\n\nWith the measurement sets for each source, we generated \nnaturally-weighted dirty maps of the full Ka-band \n(9 mm effective wavelength) and each 4 GHz baseband individually (8.1 mm and\n1.05 cm effective wavelengths, respectively); multi-frequency synthesis\nimaging mode was used in all cases. We defined regions to deconvolve using the \\textit{clean}\nalgorithm by drawing CASA regions around the peak source emission in each dirty map and then performed non-interactive\ncleaning down to $\\sim$3$\\times$ the rms noise using natural weighting. We then examined the \ncleaned images for additional source emission that was apparent after \ncleaning the strong sources. If additional source emission was detected, we repeated \nthe above steps with additional clean masks. We also imaged the data using\nBriggs weighting with robust parameters of 0.5, 0.25, and 0; the robust parameter \nadjusts the relative weighting of the short and long baselines in the deconvolution process. \n\nA robust parameter of 2 is comparable to natural weighting and typically \nproduces an image with the lowest noise, but\nalso lower resolution; a robust parameter of -2 is comparable to \nuniform weighting and has the best resolution\nbut with a higher noise level because there are fewer data at the \nlonger baselines relative to short baselines.\nIntermediate values of the robust parameter enable the image \nresolution and sensitivity to be adjusted to \nfind an optimal balance. This methodology \nwas applied to both the A and B configuration data. \nFor the data with both A and B configuration\nobservations, we produced a merged measurement set using the \\textit{concat} \ntask and performed the same imaging steps as noted above.\nThe largest angular scales \nthat can be recovered in A and B-configurations\nare $\\sim$0\\farcs8 (180 AU) and $\\sim$2\\farcs6 (600 AU), respectively; these numbers apply to\nnatural weighted maps, and the maps made using Briggs weighting (with robust between 0 and 0.5) will have \nsmaller largest angular scales\\footnote{https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/docs/manuals/oss2016A/performance/resolution}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Data Analysis}\n\nTo find companion sources, we visually inspected the images from each \nKa-band baseband (8 mm and 1 cm) and the full bandwidth (9 mm) for multiple sources.\nWe define a multiple system as the detection of multiple discrete continuum sources, detected at 8 mm with\na S/N $\\ga$6 or at 9 mm with S/N $\\ga$ 5; however, if there is a previous detection\nin the near-IR, we allowed sources to have S/N of 4. We also examined images from each\nrobustness level given that some companions only became apparent with robust levels $<$0.5; \nthis is because the sources may be blended with natural weighting and only resolved at the \nhigher resolution provided by images with a lower robust parameter.\nThe flux densities of the sources (multiple and single) were measured using the \nCASA task \\textit{imfit}, and the peak flux densities are measured directly from the \nimages. Most sources are within the inner 20\\arcsec\\ of the primary beam,\nso the correction is $<$15\\%. The integrated and peak flux densities reported for all sources have\nthe primary beam correction applied.\n\nFor single sources, the flux densities were measured \nfrom the B-configuration image generated with natural weighting, \ngiven that those data would be most sensitive to the largest scale\nof emission. The flux densities of the multiples separated by $<$500 AU were\nmeasured from the A+B configuration images generated with natural weighting; the multiples\nseparated by $<$50 AU have their flux densities measured from the A-configuration data alone.\nThe spectral indices of the integrated and peak intensities were calculated from the 8 mm and 1 cm\nflux density measurements and the spectral index error results from the \nstandard error propagation \\citep{chiang2012}. All the detected sources and companions have detections\nat both 8 mm and 1 cm.\n\nThe separations of multiple systems are determined by simultaneously fitting multiple Gaussian components and\ncalculating the distance between Gaussian central positions. The measured flux densities\nof the single and multiple sources are given in Table 2. The separations of apparent\ncompanion sources are given in Tables 3, 4, and 5 and are further discussed in the following sections.\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\nThe VANDAM survey data provide an unprecedented characterization of\nprotostellar multiplicity in terms of sample size, angular/linear resolution, and sensitivity.\nThe current results probe previously uncharted regions of protostellar \ncompanion separations, with a complete sample probing scales\ndown to $\\sim$15 AU. We identify multiple sources out to separations of \n43\\arcsec\\ ($\\sim$10000 AU; $\\sim$0.05 pc). This upper limit\nto multiple system separation is not physically motivated, but this scale is at the half-power point of\nthe VLA primary beam at 8 mm. However, this scale is also comparable to the typical radius of protostellar\nenvelopes \\citep[0.05 pc;][]{bm1989} and the break point at 0.04 pc between clustering \n(on larger scales) and multiplicity (on smaller scales) in \nthe Taurus molecular cloud \\citep{larson1995}. Moreover, on scales $\\ga$20\\arcsec\\ multiplicity in Perseus has been \ncharacterized in the infrared and (sub)millimeter \\citep[e.g.,][]{looney2000, chen2013}. \nThus, the main discovery space opened by our survey is on scales less than 1000 AU. \nThe nature of the multiple continuum \nsources we detect is discussed further in Section 5.\n\nIn total, we have found 26 multiple systems in the Perseus molecular cloud with our\nVLA data, assuming that sources out to 10000 AU\nconstitute a single system; this number changes depending on the range of separations considered. Of these 26\nmultiple systems, 16 are new detections or reflect the discovery of a new component to an \nexisting multiple system. The newly discovered multiple systems are described in Section 4.1. The continuum\nproperties for all detected sources are given in Table 2, and the multiple systems broken down into classes\nare given in Tables 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\\subsection{Close Multiples}\n\n\\subsubsection{Multiple Systems Separated by $<$ 500 AU}\nThe VANDAM data dramatically improve our\nknowledge of protostellar multiplicity on scales $<$ 500 AU. Toward\nthe Class 0 sources, in particular, there have only been a few studies with \nsmall samples having spatial resolution $<$ 500 AU \\citep[e.g.,][]{looney2000,maury2010,chen2013}. \nScales $<$ 500 AU are important because this is the size of largest disks observe toward\nClass II sources \\citep[e.g.,][]{simon2000}, and\nat smaller scales companion sources may form within\ngravitationally unstable disks \\citep{adams1989}.\n\n\nWe identified 13 new companion sources separated by 30 AU to 500 AU out of \nthe 18 total close multiple systems shown in Figure \\ref{lt500AU}. Of these new companions, 5 are in Class 0 systems, 6 \nare in Class I systems, and 2 are in Class II systems. Prior to the VANDAM survey, only two Class 0 sources\nhad been known to have companions on $<$ 500 AU,  NGC 1333 IRAS 4A and SVS13A \\citep{looney2000,\nrodriguez1999,anglada2004}. The companion toward NGC 1333 IRAS2A (Per-emb-27)\n was previously presented in the first VANDAM paper \\citep{tobin2015} and we \ninclude it with the new detections. We note that two Class I multiples (L1448 IRS1 and EDJ2009-183) in Figure \\ref{lt500AU} \nhave companions that are quite faint. However, we know that these detections are real because the\ncompanions had been previously detected in the near-IR \\citet{connelley2008}. \n\n\nThe companions with separations between 30~AU and 500~AU have a \nvariety of relative flux densities, the faintest being\n$\\sim$10 times fainter than the brightest source in the system, see \nTables 3, 4, and 5. Furthermore, the spectral index \nof the 8 mm and 1 cm emission is positive for all companion sources, but often less than 2,\nindicating a combination of dust and free-free emission is responsible for generating\nthe observed emission. The spectral index ($\\alpha$) for\ndust emission is expected to be steeply rising with $\\alpha$ $\\sim$ 2 + $\\beta$ (if optically-thin), \nwhere beta is the dust opacity spectral index. Free-free emission typically has a flatter spectral\nindex as compared to dust, with a 2 $\\ge$ $\\alpha$ $\\ge$ -0.1 \\citep{rodriguez1993}. Non-thermal\nsynchrotron emission on the other hand typically has $\\alpha$ $\\sim$ -0.7 \\citep{condon1984}. Thus, it \nis unlikely for any companion sources to be background extragalactic objects. See Section 4.6 for more details on the\nestimated number of extragalactic background sources.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Multiple Systems Separated by $<$ 30 AU}\n\nThe spatial resolution of 15 AU afforded by our observations\nenables us to uncover strong evidence for multiplicity on scales $<$ 30 AU for 3 Class 0 sources.\nThese three sources are shown in Figures \\ref{IRAS03292}, \\ref{IRAS03282}, and \\ref{Per18}; the top panels show\nthe emission at multiple resolutions and the bottom panels show the spectral index maps. All three systems are\nembedded within a larger structure and the companions are only revealed at the highest resolutions. Furthermore,\nthe spectral index maps show that both dust and free-free emission are contributing to the source fluxes. These\nthree close multiple sources have separations between 18.5 AU and 22.3 AU, making them\nthe most compact multiple protostar systems \ndirectly detected. Previously, the closest known  \ndeeply embedded systems detected at millimeter/centimeter wavelengths\nwere the 45 AU system in L1551 IRS 5 \\citep{looney1997,rodriguez1998} and\nthe 40 AU system in IRAS 16293-2422A \\citep{wootten1989}. The implications of these systems will be discussed\nfurther in Section 5.2 and more details of these sources are discussed in Appendix A. \nIn addition to these three systems, four others showed evidence for resolved structure\non $<$30~AU scales but did not have enough S/N to be regarded as a multiple system, and these additional sources are also\nshown in Appendix B.\n\n\\subsection{Multiple Systems Separated by $>$ 500 AU}\n\nWe show images of the multiple systems on scales $>$ 500~AU in Appendix C.\nOf the wide multiples shown, only Per-emb-37\n(see Appendix C) is a new detection, \nthough the companion sources are distinct\nin \\textit{Spitzer} IRAC imaging.\nFormally, our level of completeness is a function of separation given\nthe decreased sensitivity away from field center, but the primary beam response is still 85\\% at 20\\arcsec\\ from\nthe field center. On scales $>$20\\arcsec\\ (4600~AU), the multiplicity of protostars has been characterized at\ninfrared and submillimeter wavelengths. We detect all known wide multiples with separations between 4600~AU and 10000~AU.\nThe analysis of expected extragalactic background sources given in Section 4.6 suggests that there may be a background source\nwithin the VLA primary beam in a few fields. To check for such sources, \nwe have cross-compared our images with infrared imaging from \\textit{Spitzer} or \\textit{Herschel} \\citep{evans2009,sadavoy2014}\nto verify that there are associated infrared sources with the wide multiple systems, and that their\ncolors and flux densities that are inconsistent with being extragalactic objects.\n\n\n\\subsection{Multiplicity Statistics}\n\nIn our analysis of multiplicity in Perseus, we only consider the sources detected as multiples\nin our data and not those reported from other studies for consistent. See Appendix C for a discussion\nof non-detections of previously reported multiples. The detected Class 0 multiple systems are listed in Table 3, the detected Class I multiple \nsystems are listed in Table 4, and the Class II multiple systems are listed in Table 5. \n\nThe MF and CSF (see section 1 for definitions) are the key figures of merit for\ndescribing the multiplicity for collections of stars. \nWe have calculated these statistics for the VANDAM Perseus Survey: \nfor the entire sample, MF = 0.40 $\\pm$ 0.06 and CSF = 0.71 $\\pm$ 0.06 (S:B:T:Q:5:6=37:17:5:2:2:1),\nfor the Class 0 sources MF = 0.57 $\\pm$ 0.09 and CSF = 1.2 $\\pm$ 0.2 (S:B:T:Q:5:6=15:9:5:2:2:1), and\nfor the Class I sources MF = 0.23 $\\pm$ 0.08 and CSF = 0.23 $\\pm$ 0.08 (S:B:T:Q=20:6:0:0),\n\\footnote{Note that the uncertainties throughout the text\nare calculated assuming binomial statistics, $\\sigma_{CSF}$ = (N$_{comp}$(1-N$_{comp}$/N$_{sys}$)$^{-0.5}$ \n$\\times$ 1/N$_{sys}$ where N$_{comp}$ is the number of companions and N$_{sys}$ is the number of systems.\n$\\sigma_{MF}$ is calculated similarly, but by substituting N$_{mult}$ (number of multiple systems) for N$_{comp}$.\nPoisson statistics are not used because the criteria of N$_{comp}$ $>>$ N$_{sys}$ is not met. However, we note\nthat the variance calculated assuming binomial statistics is only slightly smaller than that of \nPoisson statistics. For the case of CSF $>$ 1.0, $\\sigma_{CSF}$ is not a real number and we revert to \nPoisson statistics in this case.}. The statistics are further\nenumerated in Table 6 for different ranges of separations \nfor the full sample, Class 0 sub-sample, and Class I sub-sample.\nNote that the Class 0 systems that have a wide Class I or Class II companion are only considered\nin the Class 0 MF and CSF, and the Class 0/I systems are also only considered in the Class 0 statistics.\nFurthermore, we only include the Class 0 and Class I systems detected in our survey within these statistics.\nBecause the smallest separations that we can probe is $\\sim$15 AU, the MF and CSF values \ngiven here and in Table 6 should be considered lower limits.\n\n\n\nThe Class II sources have MF = 0.33 $\\pm$ 0.19 and CSF = 0.33 $\\pm$ 0.19 (S:B:T:Q=4:2:0:0), but our\nsurvey only included a small number of Class II sources and these systems are bright\nin the far-infrared. Thus, the Class II statistics are biased and too small to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\n\nThe multiplicity of Class~0 protostars was previously examined by \\citet{chen2013} and those authors found\nMF=0.64 $\\pm$ 0.08 and CSF = 0.91 $\\pm$ 0.05 for a separation range of 50 AU to 5000 AU. For the Class~0\nmultiples within this separation range, we find an MF = 0.45 $\\pm$ 0.09 and \nCSF = 0.88 $\\pm$ 0.06. The results are comparable, and the difference\nin the MF could be due to sample bias in \\citet{chen2013} and the fact that we do not detect multiplicity toward all Perseus\nsources where  \\citet{chen2013} reported multiplicity (see Sections 5 and the Appendix for further discussion).\n\nFor the Class I sources, \\citet{connelley2008} find a MF = 0.35 $\\pm$ 0.03 and \nCSF = 0.45 $\\pm$ 0.04 (S:B:T:Q=122:51:12:4). \\citet{duchene2013} presented a combined analysis of\n\\citet{connelley2009} and \\citet{duchene2007} to derive a CSF of 0.35 $\\pm$ 0.05 for Class I sources \nwith separations between 50~AU and 2000~AU. For Class I multiples in the same separation range, \nwe find both the MF and CSF = 0.28 $\\pm$ 0.08; this\nis consistent with the results of \\citet{duchene2013} within the uncertainties. \nWe note that there are two systems comprised of \na Class 0 and a Class I source within this range of separations\nthat were included in the Class 0 statistics only.\nIf we added these sources to the Class I statistics, the MF and CSF \nwould be more consistent with the \\citet{duchene2013} value.\n\nWe find that the overall values of MF and CSF for the Class 0 and Class I sources are not \nsignificantly different from previous studies, despite our larger and improved sample for several\nreasons: 1) many systems already considered multiple in the MF were found in our survey\nto have additional closer systems,\n2) the number of new multiple systems is balanced by the number of additional systems confirmed to be single, and\n3) some systems previously considered to be multiple are not confirmed in our study. \nThe MF of Class 0s is lower, likely due to our unbiased sample which detected more single systems. Furthermore,\npast studies have often focused on systems that were known to be multiple, \nand samples were biased to the brightest sources at millimeter\nwavelengths.\n\n\\subsection{Separation Distribution}\n\n\nFigure \\ref{comb-histo} shows the distribution of companion separation for our \nfull sample and for the Class 0 and Class I sub-samples, using \nthe separations listed in Tables 3, 4, and 5. For systems comprised\nof 3 or more members, the distances are all referenced to a single source, usually the most luminous. Thus,\nonly two separations are considered for a triple system, not all three possible separations.\nIn the case\nof a quadruple (or higher order) comprised of two close multiple systems (e.g., L1448-N, Appendix C) then only the brightest members\nin each close multiple system are used to compute the distance to the more widely separated system.\nFor the full sample, we find a bi-modal distribution with peaks at separations of $\\sim$75 AU and $\\sim$3000 AU. Between\nthese peaks there is a valley with only 7 companion sources detected between \n200 AU and 1000 AU. There is also a notable decline in multiplicity at separations $<$ 57.7 AU,\nwith only three sources having strong evidence of multiplicity. \nWe emphasize that the range of spatial scales examined and the numbers of multiple \nsystems detected and characterized is currently without precedent, especially\nfor a sample within the same molecular cloud at a common distance. Much of the improvement\nin statistics comes at scales less than 500 AU, where there had been few previous observations. The\nlargest previous study for Class 0 protostars by \\citet{chen2013} had median resolution of 600 AU.  \nWe do note, however, that the statistical significance of \nthe two peaks is marginal in the histograms, but we will statistically compare the cumulative distribution\nin the following section.\n\nThe size of our sample enables us to examine \nthe multiplicity of Class 0 and Class I\nsystems independently and Figure \\ref{comb-histo} also shows \nseveral key differences between the Class 0 and Class I separation\ndistributions. First, the Class I systems\nhave a peak in companion frequency at $\\sim$75 AU scales and only a few multiples on scales larger than 100 AU.\nThe Class 0 systems on the other hand retain the double-peaked distribution seen \nfor the full sample. We constructed\ncumulative distributions for the two samples (see Figure \\ref{cumulat-class}) and \nperformed an Anderson-Darling (AD) test\\footnote{The Anderson-Darling test is \nsimilar to the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test, but is \nmore statistically robust. This because the KS-test uses the maximum deviation to calculate the probability\nand is not as sensitive when deviations are at the ends of the distribution or when there are \nsmall but significant deviations throughout the distribution. https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/beware-the-kolmogorov-smirnov-test} \\citep{scholz1987}, the results of which indicate that  \nthe probability of the Class 0 and Class I sources being drawn from the same distribution is only 0.16. \nThe inclusion of wide multiples comprised of both Class 0 and Class I sources\n with Class 0 would decrease the probability of the\ntwo samples being drawn from the same distribution, but if they were included with the Class I\ndistribution only, that would make it more likely that the Class 0 and Class I samples were drawn from the same\ndistribution. Thus, our results are suggestive of differences between the separation distributions\nof the Class 0 and Class I protostars but with marginal statistical significance.\n\n\\subsection{Constraining the Functional Form of the Separation Distribution}\n\nWe compared our dataset to several simple models to determine what the data\ncan and cannot rule-out in terms of the underlying separation distribution. There are several possible models\nthat could describe the underlying distribution of separations, \nand we tested a log-flat distribution, \na model that represents the fields solar-type star separation distribution,\nand a model that employs multiple Gaussian functions.\n\n\nWe first compared to a \nlog-flat distribution of multiples between 15 and 10000 AU, also known\n as {\\\"O}pik's Law \\citep{opik1924}.\nSuch a distribution would produce a constant level of \nmultiplicity at all separations in a histogram like that of \nFigure \\ref{comb-histo}.\nThe cumulative distribution for a log-flat distribution\nof separations is drawn in Figure \\ref{cumulat-full} and compared to the data.\nThe log-flat distribution is always in excess of the observed distribution, except for the largest separations, and\nthe AD probability for this distribution\nis 0.1, so a log-flat distribution of separations is unlikely.\n\n\nWe also considered a model that represents the separation distribution of field\nsolar-type multiple systems.\nThe distribution was fit with a Gaussian by \\citet{raghavan2010}\nwith a mean $log(a)$ = 1.7 ($\\sim$50 AU) and $\\sigma_{loga}$ = 1.52 in units of log(AU). These\nare derived from $log(P)$ = 5.03, $\\sigma_{logP}$ = 2.28 in units of log(days) assuming a 1.5 $M_{\\sun}$ primary mass.\nWe compare our separation distribution to the \\citet{raghavan2010} fit, finding an\nAD probability of 0.00015, indicating that the separation distribution of \nsolar-type multiples is very unlikely to match that of our protostellar multiples. \nThe disagreement provides further evidence that binary systems dynamically \nevolve from their initial separations.\n\nFinally, the double-peaked histogram in Figure \\ref{comb-histo} suggests that the separation distribution might\nbe represented by two Gaussians. We compared the observed distribution to a grid of Gaussian functions\nand found that two Gaussians are consistent with the data (probabilities of 0.99 are achieved). \nHowever, the parameters of the Gaussians are not well-constrained;\na typical fit has the inner peak at $\\sim$ 90 AU and the outer peak between 3000~AU and 10000~AU.\n\n\\subsection{Extragalactic Background Estimation}\n\nExtragalactic sources that are dominated by synchrotron emission\nincrease in brightness at longer wavelengths and can become a source of contamination\nin sensitive radio surveys.\nWe have followed the analysis for background objects presented in\n\\citet{anglada1998} \nto estimate the number of background source that we expect to find\nin our survey. Our typical sensitivity was 10 {\\mbox{$\\mu$Jy}}, thus we estimate the number\nof extragalactic background sources at Ka-band \nwith a flux density $\\ge$30 $\\mu$Jy within a 5\\arcsec\\ (1150 AU) field of view. This\nis done by extrapolating the 5 GHz number counts and\nassuming a typical spectral index of $\\alpha$ = -0.7 for optically-thin synchrotron \nemission \\citep{condon1984}. We find that there is a probability of only\n3.3 $\\times$10$^{-4}$ of finding a background source within a 5\\arcsec\\ field of view; \nthe probability becomes 0.041 for a 60\\arcsec\\ field of view. This analysis ignores the \npotential contributions of radio emission from submillimeter galaxies, \nwhere the combination of bright dust and free-free emission associated\nwith star formation will likely produce flatter spectral indices, making them more detectable. \nFor 90 observed fields, we expect to detect $\\sim$4 extra-galactic sources. We \nconclusively identify two likely extragalactic sources in our observations, see Tables 1 and 2. They\nhave negative spectral indices at Ka-band and no corresponding detections at shorter wavelengths. These numbers\nare consistent with the expected number of extragalactic sources considering that a portion of the fields\nobserved overlapping regions of sky.\nThus, it is very unlikely that any close or wide multiples are false detections due\nto extragalactic confusion.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe origin of stellar multiplicity has gained significant attention recently\ndue to the downward revision of solar-type star multiplicity frequency to 0.46 \\citep{raghavan2010}\nand the finding that the fraction of single M-stars is $\\sim$0.63 \\citep{lada2006}. Furthermore,\nthe searches for brown dwarf and planetary mass companions around pre-main sequence stars\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{white2001,kohler2006,reipurth2007,kraus2008,kraus2011}, have produced large statistical \nsamples of multiplicity.\n Nevertheless, connecting these statistics to \nmultiple star formation remained uncertain due\nto a lack of definitive results on the multiplicity and separation distribution toward\nembedded protostars.\n\nThe primary routes for the formation of multiple systems are (1) the fragmentation of the core or filament\nand (2) disk fragmentation. Core fragmentation can be either thermal (Jeans) fragmentation aided\nby rotation and asymmetry \\citep[e.g.,][]{bb1993, bonnell1993} or turbulent fragmentation\n\\citep{padoan2002,padoan2004,offner2010}; these routes tend to produce companions on $\\sim$1000 AU scales, but can also\nresult in companions with ultimate separations $<$ 100 AU via migration \\citep{offner2010,bate2012}.\nFragmentation of the protostellar disk via gravitational instability \ncan also directly form close companion systems \\citep[e.g.,][]{adams1989,bonnell1994a,kratter2010,zhu2012}.\n\nLarge simulations of entire star forming molecular clouds have been conducted with enough resolution\nto examine fragmentation on the scales from the cloud down to the disks \\citep[e.g.,][]{bate2009,bate2012}.\nThe multiplicity results from such simulations are typically\ncompared to the field star multiplicity; however, several Gyr\nof dynamical evolution in the field population will impact such comparisons\nto simulations of younger systems. \nObservations of more deeply embedded multiple systems, such as those presented in this paper,\n will provide a more direct diagnostic to test models of star formation, given that their ages are most likely \nall less than 0.5 Myr \\citep{dunham2014}, comparable to the length of time\nexplored in the simulations.\n\nThere has been debate on the origin and frequency of multiplicity \nin the Class 0 protostellar phase, centering\naround studies that have small, biased samples of sources. \n\\citet{looney2000} examined 11 Class 0 protostellar systems, finding a\npreponderance of multiplicity in these systems. However, the sources in the sample \nare among the brightest millimeter sources in the nearby star forming regions and\nmay not be representative. \\citet{maury2010} then examined 5 systems\n\\citep[including 2 Very Low Luminosity Objects, protostellar sources which have internal\nluminosities $<$ 0.1 L$_{\\sun}$; ][]{young2004}, not\nfinding any multiples on scales $\\la$ 1600 AU. Their sample, combined with that of \n\\citet{looney2000}, led them to conclude that there was no evidence for multiplicity\non scales between 150 AU and 400 AU for Class 0 protostars; the separation of 400 AU reflects the updated\ndistance to Perseus, which affects the separation of NGC 1333 IRAS4A. Moreover, \\cite{maury2010}\nwent on to tentatively suggest that multiplicity \\textit{increased} from the Class 0 to Class I\nphase, at least for separations between 150 AU and 400 AU. This would not necessarily be\na true increase in multiplicity but possibly an evolution in separations from initially\nwider separations to closer separations \\citep[e.g.,][]{offner2010,zhao2013}. Nonetheless,\nthe robustness of these findings was unclear given the small sample sizes of both\n\\cite{maury2010} and \\cite{looney2000}.\n\n\n\\citet{chen2013} made use of archival SMA data to better characterize\nmultiplicity in the Class 0 phase using a sample of 33 protostars located in various star forming regions.\nFor the separation range (50 AU to 5000 AU), \\citet{chen2013} showed that the multiplicity fraction for Class 0 protostars is $\\sim$0.65.\nThis is much higher than the $\\sim$0.35 for Class I systems \\citep{connelley2008}\n and $\\sim$0.2 for solar-type field stars \\citep{raghavan2010}, indicating that multiplicity is highest in \nthe Class 0 phase in this separation range. However, that study did not necessarily rule-out\nthe conclusion by \\citet{maury2010} of multiplicity increasing for separations\nbetween 150 AU and 400 AU. This is because \\citet{chen2013} lacked homogeneous\nsensitivity and resolution (median resolution of 600 AU), but multiples were reported\nby \\citet{chen2013} in the range between 150 AU to 400 AU.\n\nThe VANDAM survey surmounts these limitations of the previous\nstudies by observing a large number of protostars (94; 77 detected) in a single star forming region, at\nnearly uniform sensitivity (apart from the sensitivity attenuation of the primary beam) and resolution. \nMultiple sources can be resolved with separations\nas small as $\\sim$0\\farcs065 (15 AU). This survey contains the largest\nand least biased sample of protostars ever observed with sub-arcsecond resolution.\nThis survey also boasts the highest ever sensitivity in the 8 mm to 1 cm wavelength range for protostellar multiples. \nThus, we have been able to characterize protostellar multiplicity with unprecedented statistics.\n\n\n\nAlthough the results from this survey represent enormous progress, there are limitations to how well multiplicity\ncan be characterized in the context of the protostellar properties. A major limitation is that we\ndo not know the masses of the protostars (or systems) themselves. We only know the bolometric luminosities\nsampled from the near-infrared to submillimeter, which range between $\\sim$0.1 L${\\sun}$ and $\\sim$ 33 L${\\sun}$, with \na median of 0.7 L${\\sun}$. The range and distribution of luminosities are typical of the population of known\nprotostars \\citep{dunham2014,dunham2015}. However, it is not trivial to directly translate luminosity to stellar mass\nfor protostars because the emergent luminosity is dominated by (or has a significant component from) accretion\nprocesses that can be highly variable.\n\n \n\nTo make estimates of the protostar masses, we can compare to models \nof the protostellar luminosity function with an underlying protostellar mass function,\nassuming smooth accretion \\citep{offner2011,mckee2010}. Within the context of these models,\nmost protostars in our sample are expected to be progenitors of K and M-stars.\nHowever, even if those models are reliable, the bolometric luminosities of the components to multiple\nsystems separated by $\\la$ 1500~AU\ncannot be determined due to the resolution limitations at mid to far-infrared wavelengths.\n Thus, we cannot say anything about the mass or luminosity ratios of the close \nprotostellar binaries themselves. Finally, there is an inherent bias in characterizing\nmultiplicity at millimeter/centimeter wavelengths, and we may not detect all \ncompanion sources as evidenced by some of the faint\ncompanion sources detected toward some Class I systems. \nTherefore, our statistics represent lower limits\nto the MF, CSF, and the companion frequency as a function \nof separation, see section 5.6 for further discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Origin of the Bi-modal Separation Distribution}\n\nThe distributions of separations shown in Figure \\ref{comb-histo}\nrepresent the most complete snapshot of protostellar multiplicity and also the highest resolution study that\nhas been compiled in a single star forming region. It is tempting to interpret the distribution of separations\nas the initial distribution of separations in multiple systems; however, even \nat these very young ages it is possible that significant migration has \nalready taken place \\citep[e.g.,][]{offner2010,bate2012}. For example,\nsystems driving orthogonal outflows, but with close separations, like NGC 1333 IRAS2A \\citep{tobin2015},\nmay have resulted from migration. Nevertheless, our sample of embedded multiples, especially the Class 0 \nsystems, should have a separation distribution that is closer to the initial separation\ndistribution than what would be obtained from more evolved \nsources. Thus, the VANDAM survey provides the best direct constraints on the origin of multiplicity thus far. \n\n\nThe most striking feature of the separation distribution for the full sample and Class 0 sources\nin Figure \\ref{comb-histo} is that the distribution appears bi-modal, with one peak near $\\sim$75 AU \nand the other near $\\sim$3000 AU. This feature is unlikely to be the result of any selection bias because\nwe have observed all the known protostars in the Perseus molecular clouds. Furthermore, our spatial resolution \nand sensitivity are sufficient to have detected multiples between 100 AU and 1000 AU if they were present.\n\n\nAn attractive interpretation of the bi-modal distribution is that the peaks are produced \nby two distinct mechanisms, namely disk and core fragmentation, respectively. Disk fragmentation\nwould naturally produce the multiples of $\\la$ 300 AU scales and core fragmentation would then produce the\nmultiplicity on scales $>$ 1000 AU. Early studies of thermal (Jeans) fragmentation of \ndense cores concentrated on the effects of rotation and non-spherical \nshape \\citep[e.g.,][]{bonnell1993,bb1993}. More recent calculations \nhave focused on fragmentation induced by turbulence \\citep{walch2009, offner2010, padoan2002}.\nThe complex structure and velocity fields often observed toward protostellar cores may provide some \nevidence for this picture \\citep{tobin2011,pineda2011,pineda2015}. Furthermore,\nwide multiples produced through turbulent fragmentation can tighten their \nseparations through orbital migration on timescales as short as 10 kyr, \npotentially contributing to the close multiple population \\citep{offner2010}.\nHowever, if the close multiples are the result of migration, some mechanism must then cause them to \naccumulate at $\\sim$ 75 AU rather than continuing to migrate inward.\n\nThe differences in the separation distributions for the Class 0 and Class I \nsystems are suggestive of evolutionary effects. Class 0 systems have considerably\nmore wide multiples than Class I systems. \nThe orbital period for a 4000 AU separation\nbinary system is $\\sim$250 kyr (assuming 1 $M_{\\sun}$), and if the system dissolves due\nto internal dynamics, the timescale should be longer than an orbital period. This timescale is likely too long\nfor protostellar systems because the expected lifetime of a Class 0 system is only $\\sim$160 kyr \\citep{dunham2014}.\nTherefore, we consider two additional interpretations related to the formation and evolution of these systems.\n\n\n\nThe first possibility is that wide multiples had formed initially, and as they evolved into the \nClass I phase the separations increased because the companions may have been unbound at the time of formation due\nto initially large differential velocities \nas a result of turbulent fragmentation.\nWhile it is true that systems are not binary/multiple if they\nare not gravitationally bound, we are unable to assess whether \nor not all systems are bound. Therefore, we presently\nconsider all systems with projected separations less than 10000 AU as\na bound multiple system.\nThe boundedness of the widely separated systems is an active area \nof investigation \\citep[e.g.,][ Lee et al. in prep.]{lee2015}, and\nsystems that are currently bound within their star forming cores \nmay later become unbound as their envelope material is\ndispersed by outflows \\citep{arce2006,offner2014}.\n\n\nThe second possibility is that the wide multiples\ndynamically evolved toward close separations, giving rise to the peak at $\\sim$75 AU.\nWe regard the first possibility as more likely because, many of the wide Class 0\nmultiples are separated by more than 1000 AU, making it \npossible that some\nof these systems would be unbound. In addition, the fraction of multiples at \n$<$ 300 AU scales\nis comparable for both Class 0 and Class I sources. The similarity at scales $<$ \n300 AU\ncan be explained by either wide multiples not frequently migrating to $<$ 300 AU scales\nor by the currently observed Class 0 multiples at $<$ \n300 AU \nmigrating  to scales $<$ 15 AU (i.e., are now unresolved). The\n$>$1000 AU companions would then need to migrate and fill-in the distribution at \n$<$ 300 AU\nscales.\n\nTurbulent fragmentation and disk fragmentation are expected to produce multiple systems that appear nearly coeval. \nOn the other hand, the Class 0 sources with widely separated Class I or Class II\ncompanions may also be evidence that significant, rapid orbital evolution does not happen\nin all cases or that an additional process is at work.\nA promising route to explain these systems is a dynamical \nejection scenario \\citep{reipurth2001,reipurth2010,reipurth2012}. In this scenario, a close triple system would \nhave formed initially and dynamical interactions cause one member to be ejected into a very wide orbit. Even though\nthe ejected companion would be as young as the remaining compact binary, it might appear more\nevolved because it would no longer be so deeply embedded and perhaps directly visible at near-infrared wavelengths. Thus,\nthe widely separated systems with different evolutionary states could be very young stars that were ejected from their cores.\n\n\n\\subsection{Multiplicity Evolution}\n\nA principle conclusion of \\citet{chen2013} was that multiplicity is decreasing with evolution,\ndecreasing from the Class 0 phase to the Class I phase within the separation range of 50 AU to 5000 AU. However, a limitation\nof that survey was the inhomogeneous resolution (median resolution of 600 AU). In comparison, \nthe VANDAM survey consists of a large, homogeneous sample at  $\\sim$15 AU resolution.\nWith this large dataset, we can \nexamine the multiplicity frequency of Class 0 and Class I systems separately.\n\n\n\nWe also showed the apparent differences between the Class 0 and Class I \nmultiplicity distributions at separations $>$ 1000 AU in Figure \\ref{comb-histo} (see Section 4.4), and\nthat there is marginal evidence for a statistical difference in the separations between the two populations. \nWe can also compare the Class 0 and Class I populations in terms of their MF and CSF. \nNote that we count those Class 0 systems with a wide Class I or Class II companion in the MF\nand CSF for the Class 0 sources only. Our main results are unchanged if these sources were also included in\nthe Class I statistics.\n\n\n\nAcross the full range of separations, from 15 AU to 10000 AU, we find \nthat multiplicity is decreasing from the Class 0 to the Class I phase, in agreement with\n\\citet{chen2013} and in contrast with \\citet{maury2010}. For example, we the \nMF = 0.57$\\pm$0.09 for Class 0s and MF = 0.23$\\pm$0.08 for Class Is.\nIf we then examine the separation range from 15 AU to 5000 AU \\citep[the same outer limit as][]{chen2013}, we still find \ndecreasing multiplicity from Class 0 to Class I (MFs of 0.55$\\pm$0.09 and 0.24$\\pm$0.08, respectively). The\nsame is true if we examine the separation range from 50 AU to 5000 AU \\citep[the same range as][]{chen2013}, \nthough we find that the MF for Class 0 sources is 0.45$\\pm$0.09 and 0.24$\\pm$0.08 for Class I sources. \nWe note, however, that our value of Class I multiplicity\nis consistent within the uncertainties with both the \\citet{connelley2008} \nvalue of 0.35$\\pm$0.03 and the value for field solar-type\nstars from \\citet{dm1991} for the separation \nrange between 50 AU and 5000 AU as calculated by \\citet{chen2013}. Thus, while we confirm a multiplicity decrease on these\nscales from Class 0 to Class I, we do not confirm a further decrease from Class I to field stars from our data alone.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the larger separations, the MF and CSF between 15 AU and 2000 AU of the Class 0 \nand Class I subsamples are consistent within the uncertainties.\nThus, we conclude that on scales less than 2000 AU,\nthere does not appear to be multiplicity evolution taking place between the Class 0 and Class I \nphase. \\citet{maury2010} had suggested \nthat multiplicity increased from the Class 0\nto the Class I phase\non these scales,\nbut this suggestion is not supported by our larger sample. Furthermore,\n\\citet{maury2010} suggested that there was no evidence for multiplicity\nbetween 150 AU and 550 AU (400 AU). While multiples are clearly found within this range of separations\nin our study and that of \\citet{chen2013}, there is a \ndeficit in multiples in this range of\nseparations relative to smaller and larger scales. Suffice it to say that there is, however, evidence\nfor\nslightly lower multiplicity for both Class 0 and Class I systems\nbetween 150 AU and 1000 AU.\n\n\\subsection{Evidence for Disk Fragmentation}\n\nThree remarkable systems (IRAS 03292+3039/Per-emb-2, IRAS 03282+3035/Per-emb-5, and Per-emb-18) \nshow multiplicity on scales $<$ 30 AU; see Figures \\ref{IRAS03292}, \\ref{IRAS03282}, and \\ref{Per18}.\nIn each of these cases, the sources are surrounded by an extended structure and only become resolved into discrete\nsources when imaged at higher resolution. IRAS 03292+3039/Per-emb-2 and Per-emb-18 have the largest continuum\nstructures detected in our survey, about 1\\farcs5 and 1\\arcsec\\ in diameter, respectively. The A-configuration\ndata resolve-out the extended emission and reveal additional brightness peaks separated by $\\sim$19 AU in both\ncases. It is peculiar that the extended dust emission is only on the eastern \nside of Per-emb-18, having the appearance of a companion itself\nwhen viewed at lower resolution. The dusty structure surrounding IRAS 03282+3035\nis only $\\sim$0\\farcs5 in diameter.\n\nGravitational instability in a disk is the most likely mechanism for the production of\nany substructures detected on scales $<$30 AU. This scale, however, this scale is near the inner\nlimit of where the disk is expected to cool quickly enough for gravitational\ninstability to make a bound object \\citep{rafi2005,matzner2005}. \nThus, these companions may have migrated to their current locations from initially larger\nradii or the disks \nwere cold enough to allow fragmentation on these scales due to the source luminosities being\nlow; L$_{bol}$ = 0.9, 1.3, and 2.8 for Per-emb-2, Per-emb-5, and Per-emb-18, respectively.\n\n\nThe masses \nassociated with the extended structures\n on 0\\farcs5 to 1\\farcs5\n scales are estimated to be $>$ 0.1 $M_{\\sun}$ from 1.3 mm\ndust emission \\citep{tobin2015b}. However, a missing piece of evidence\n is the dense gas kinematics,  which is necessary to determine whether or not these clumps\nare the result of a fragmenting, rotationally supported disk. In the\n case of IRAS 03292+3039, there is evidence of\ninner envelope rotation \\citep{schnee2012,yen2015}, suggesting that\n a rotationally supported disk is possible for this source.\nThere have also been molecular line data for IRAS 03282+3035 \\citep{arce2006, yen2015}, but a rotation signature\n is unclear toward this source and Per-emb-18 does not yet have existing observations.\n\nThe clumpy structure observed toward IRAS 03292+3039 on $>$ 0\\farcs5 \nscales appears real, sub-peaks within this structure\nhave close coincidence with peaks observed at 1.3 mm \\citep{tobin2015b}. However, the 1.3 mm data\nhave a much smoother appearance, a possible indication that the dust emission is optically \nthick at 1.3 mm, but optically thin at 8 mm and 1 cm. It is unclear\n if the clumpy structures surrounding the source have formed or are \nlikely to form protostellar objects. The peaks observed north and south of the\nmain protostar(s) are also present at 1.3 mm and when the 8 mm data are imaged at higher resolution \n(with lower S/N).\n\nWhile we are confident that the structures observed on $<$30 AU scales are real, it is uncertain if they\nwere formed in their current locations, given that fragmentation via gravitational instability is difficult\nat this scale. Furthermore, the ultimate fate of these structures is uncertain. For instance, gravitationally\nunstable disk models often show clumps that have yet to collapse into stellar objects\nmigrating inward \\citep{vorobyov2006,vorobyov2010}. Some clumps can be tidally disrupted if they have\nnot formed a bound object, or they may be accreted on to the protostar \\citep{zhu2012}.\nThe accretion of these clumps results\nin an increased luminosity and could be an explanation for the large spread \nobserved in the luminosity distribution of young stellar objects \\citep{dunham2014}. \nIf each of the observed structures is associated with a stellar object, \nthen it is unlikely for them to merge together.\nThus, these structures could be transient or they might reflect the \nformation of close companions. \n\nAnother way to produce substructures in the dust emission is the Rossby Wave Instability \n(RWI) \\citep{barge1995, klahr1997}. \\citet{bae2015} showed\nthat RWI can be triggered in protostellar disks by the velocity\nshear of the material falling onto the disk. This process could possibly explain some of the features we observe, e.g.,\nthe asymmetric dust clump around Per-emb-18. However, the RWI only concentrates the dust and not gas, and \nthe largest dust grains are more highly concentrated than the smaller grains. Thus, in this scenario,\nthe detection of clumps would not necessarily be related to multiple star formation \\citep[e.g.,][]{vdmarel2015}.\nObservations of molecular line kinematics will help elucidate the nature of the small-scale substructures\nand these sources are close enough that orbital motion can possibly be observed\nin just a few years time.\n\n\\subsection{Orientation of Multiple Systems}\n\nFigure \\ref{posangles} shows the distribution of relative position angles \nbetween the close companions (separations $<$ 500 AU)\nand the outflow axis of the protostars; the list of position angles is given in Table 7. \nThe disk around the protostar is assumed to be oriented normal to \nthe outflow direction (at least the portion driving the jet); therefore, if close companions have \nformed in the rotational plane\nas a result of disk fragmentation or fragmentation of the rotating envelope this should be reflected in the \ndistribution of relative position angles. For comparison, we also draw the distributions\nfor a uniform distribution of angles and the \ndistribution of relative position angles for a random distribution of\nbinary orbital phases and inclinations.\n\nWithout performing any statistical tests, \nit is apparent that\nthe observations have a small \nexcess of sources with small relative position angles over what would \nexpected for randomly oriented circular orbits\n(dotted line in Figure \\ref{posangles}).\nThis is a random distribution of \ncompanion orbital phase and viewed with a random inclination, consistent\nwith companions being located in the plane of the\ndisk, normal to the outflow direction. The bottom panel of Figure \\ref{posangles}\nshows a scatter plot of companion separation versus position angle and there are\nno apparent trends. The average relative \nposition angle is 50\\degr\\ in the observations, while the average angle for \nrandomly oriented circular orbits is $\\sim$70\\degr. Elliptical orbits in the \ndisk plane would not help resolve the inconsistency because the companion\nwould spend more time at apastron and more sources would be expected to have \nrelative PAs closer to 90\\degr. Close companions formed via turbulent fragmentation\nare not expected to follow a preferred orbital configuration and could be partly \nresponsible for the disagreement. \nNote, however, that the multiple system NGC 1333 IRAS2A (Per-emb-27) has two orthogonal outflows and\nwe only list the dominant north-south outflow in the table, resulting \nin a small relative position angle. Including\nthe east-west outflow as an independent point or instead of the north-south outflow would reduce the excess.\nThus, the number of close companions with measured outflow \nposition angles is currently too small to currently draw definitive conclusions. \nHowever, the distribution of relative outflow position angles for both the close and wide multiple systems is\nbeing investigated further with new outflow data for the entire sample of Perseus protostars (Lee et al. in prep.).\n\n\n\nFollow-up of these sources will enable proper motions to be measured and determine\nif companions are co-moving or rapidly moving away. If the companion sources are \nfound to be moving away rapidly, then they are most likely to \nbe blobs of free-free emission in the jet and not true companion sources; an event like\nthis has been observed in the source IRAS 16293-2422A \\citep{pech2010}. However, the spectral indices\nof the companions are positive and not consistent with being optically thin free-free knots. Furthermore, the\ndistribution of spectral indices for companions is indistinguishable from\nthat of the single protostars, see Section 5.6.\n\n\\subsection{Comparison to T Tauri Multiples in Taurus}\n\nThe best characterized group of young stellar multiples is in Taurus, where \\citet{kraus2011}\ncombined new observations down to 3 AU scales with previous multiplicity \nsearches. This survey of visual multiples is sensitive to separations\nbetween 3 AU and 5000 AU for primary star masses ranging between 0.25 $M_{\\sun}$ and 2.5 $M_{\\sun}$. The large number\nof stars enabled the sample to be divided into low-mass and high-mass sub-samples. The high-mass\nsub-sample has a roughly uniform distribution of \ncompanions (in log(separation)) out to 5000 AU, while the low-mass sub-sample\nhas very few companions at scales $>$ 200 AU. \n\nWe compare our results to their sample in the cumulative distribution \nshown in Figure \\ref{cumulat-taurus} for separations ranging between \n15 AU and 5000 AU. Both the full sample and low-mass sub-sample ($M_*$ $<$ 0.7 $M_{\\sun}$) from \\citet{kraus2011}\nappear inconsistent with the distribution of multiples \nfound in our sample, having AD probabilities of 0.025 and 0.00015,\nrespectively. The high-mass subsample (2.5 $M_{\\sun}$ $\\ge$ $M_*$ $>$ 0.7 $M_{\\sun}$), \non the other hand, appears consistent with our distribution \nhaving an AD probability of 0.80. The primary difference between the low-mass sample and the high-mass sample\nis a lack of wide multiples in the low-mass sample. Considering the Class 0 and Class I systems separately,\nthe Class 0s agree best with the high-mass sample with an AD probability of 0.71 and the Class Is agree best\nwith the full sample with an AD probability of 0.21. For the other possible combinations with the Taurus sample, \nthe Class 0 and Class I are likely to not have been drawn from the same \ndistributions with AD probabilities less than 0.085.\n\n\nThe separation distribution agreement\nwith the high-mass subsample (2.5 $M_{\\sun}$ $\\ge$ $M_*$ $>$ 0.7 $M_{\\sun}$) and the strong disagreement with the \nfull/low-mass sample ($M_*$ $<$ 0.7 $M_{\\sun}$) is quite striking and can be interpreted in several ways.\nIf we assume that companion separations do not significantly evolve between\n the Class 0 to Class II/III phases, then one could infer that the \nmultiple protostar systems that we detect are going to be progenitors of high-mass systems.\nWhile protostellar mass measurements are not available, the closest available proxies for stellar \nmass are either luminosity or core mass. \n\\citet{mckee2010} and \\citet{offner2011} examined both the protostellar mass function and \nprotostellar luminosity functions. The observed protostellar luminosities can be reproduced with a\nmass function closely following the Chabrier IMF; the two component turbulent core model (2CTC in their Figure 3). With \nthis underlying mass function, the typical protostellar mass is $\\sim$0.2 $M_{\\sun}$ and only $\\sim$14\\% of sources should have\nmasses between 0.7 and 2.5 $M_{\\sun}$, thus our sample should be comprised of mostly sources $<$ 0.7 $M_{\\sun}$.\nFurthermore, we observe no specific trend in multiplicity with respect \nto bolometric luminosity and there is no obvious trend with core mass.\nHowever, core mass will change with evolution as the protostars accrete material and\noutflows remove material from the envelope; most Class 0 systems have core\nmasses $>$ 0.5 $M_{\\sun}$ \\citep{enoch2009}.\n\n\nIf the protostars we observe in our sample are indeed characteristic of the low-mass Taurus systems, \nthen they must\nhave undergone significant dynamical evolution since their formation and the binary orbits have\ncontracted. Therefore, the separation distribution that we observe toward the protostars could evolve toward what is observed \nfor the low-mass Taurus systems. If this interpretation is true, then by inference the high-mass systems \nin Taurus may\nhave not undergone significant dynamical evolution.\nWe caution that these statements implicitly assume that the Perseus and Taurus multiples will follow \nthe same evolutionary path.\n\n\nThe paucity of low-mass Taurus\nsystems with wide separations could imply that low-mass systems do not typically fragment on large-scales or that the\nlow-mass systems cannot hold onto wide companions. It is unknown if the wide multiple systems in \nPerseus are bound. If these wide systems drift apart over time, then the distribution of separations in Perseus\nwould become less consistent with the high-mass Taurus sample and more consistent with the low-mass Taurus sample. It was also\nargued in \\citet{kraus2011} that the high-frequency of close companions in the low-mass Taurus sample could be indicative\nof disk fragmentation occurring preferentially on a 50 AU - 100 AU scale. This finding is consistent with our\ndistribution of close separations which peaks at $\\sim$ 75 AU.\n\nFurthermore, \\citet{kraus2011} argued that the mass ratio of close companions being consistent with a log-flat\ndistribution is suggestive of disk fragmentation taking place after the primary has accumulated most of its mass,\naccounting for $\\ga$ 1/2 the entire core mass. If disk fragmentation occurred early in protostellar evolution,\n\\citet{kraus2011} argued that the mass ratio would be skewed toward unity rather than log-flat. It is unclear if such\na signature is present in our sample given that the Class 0 and Class I systems have similar numbers of companions\nseparated by $<$ 300 AU.\n\nFinally, it is also possible that the agreement and/or disagreement between the Perseus multiples\nand Taurus multiples is completely coincidental and reflects the different properties of the\ntwo clouds and their YSO populations. The two regions have significantly different clustering\nproperties, gas densities, temperatures, and ratios of protostars to pre-main sequence stars. \nThus, the differences\ncould simply result from the different initial conditions.\n\n\\subsection{Nature of 8 mm and 1 cm Emission}\n\n\nContinuum emission at 8 mm and 1 cm likely include significant contributions from both thermal dust emission and \nthermal free-free (Bremsstrahlung) are likely. The dust emission is likely tracing the \nprotostellar disk and/or inner envelope and the free-free emission is thought \nto be produced from ionized gas resulting from shocks at the base of the protostellar\njet on scales $\\la$ 10 AU \\citep[e.g.,][]{curiel1989,anglada1998}. \nFree-free emission typically becomes dominant, with respect to dust emission\nat $\\lambda$ $>$ 1 cm. \nDiscrete sources detected at centimeter wavelengths toward protostellar\ncores, have also been \nassociated with multiple star formation \\citep{rodriguez2000,anglada2004,reipurth2002,reipurth2004}.\nThis is because the presence of free-free\nemission enhances the detectability of protostellar sources, where dust emission\nmay be faint depending on the properties of the source. However, there are some\nexamples of spatially-extended free-free emission with multiple \nclumps along the outflow \\citep{rodriguez1989,rodriguez1990,curiel1993}, but\nthese sources have luminosities $>$ 50 L$_{\\sun}$ and they \nhave observed proper motion in the outflow direction\n\\citep{rodriguez2000,rodriguez1989}. Furthermore, \nclumps of emission created along free-free jets should be preferentially aligned with outflows, \nwhich is not observed survey (see Figure \\ref{posangles}).\n\n\nFigure \\ref{cumulat-spindex} shows the distributions of spectral indices \nfrom the Ka-band observations. The histograms and\ncumulative distributions of spectral indices calculated from the integrated \nflux densities and peak flux densities are quite comparable.\nThe spectral index of optically thick emission (dust or free-free)\nwill be $\\sim$2. Optically thin free-free emission will have a spectral index of $\\sim$ -0.1 and\noptically thin dust emission will have a spectral index of $\\sim$2 + $\\beta$; \n$\\beta$ in dense dusty disks or inner protostellar envelopes is typically $\\la$ 1 \\citep[e.g.,][]{testi2014,kwon2009},\nin contrast to interstellar medium dust which has $\\beta$ $\\sim$ 2 \\citep[e.g.,][]{draine1984}.\nMost spectral indices are less\nthan 2, indicative of an at least partially optically thin free-free contribution to the Ka-band flux density ,\ncausing spectral indices that are flatter than pure thermal dust emission.\n\n\nThe detection of compact free-free emission is strong evidence for the presence of\na protostar, given the requirement of a jet-driving source. However, a lack\nof detected free-free emission is not evidence for the absence of a protostellar\nsource. Nearly all the candidate companions exhibit a combination of free-free\nand dust emission at 8 mm and 1 cm, with varying levels of strength. The spectral index\nof the free-free emission is indicative of the physical conditions, extended jet emission\ntoward higher-luminosity sources is generally optically thin (spectral index $\\sim$-0.1), while\nprotostellar sources typically have spectral indices between 0 and 2. The source NGC 1333 IRAS2A\nVLA2 described in \\citet{tobin2015} has a spectral index of 1.7 and models of free-free emission \\citep{ghavamian1998}\nindicate that shock velocities in excess of 150 {\\mbox{km s$^{-1}$}}\\ and/or densities $\\sim$ 10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ are \nrequired to have such optically thick free-free emission. Such extreme conditions favor generation of emission\non small-scales\nclose to a protostellar source rather than from a jet impacting the surrounding medium. A detailed\nanalysis of the dust and free-free contributions using the 4 cm and 6 cm for the full sample\nand newly detected multiples will be analyzed in a future paper (Tychoniec et al. in prep.).\n\nEach component of the multiple systems identified in this paper\nrepresents spatially compact emission on scales less than 30 AU. \nThe densities required to produce detectable dust emission and the necessity\nof a jet driving source to produce free-free emission makes it highly probable that the \ndetected sources are indeed protostellar in origin. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{VLA-detected Companions at Millimeter Wavelengths}\n\nMany of the multiple systems uncovered by our VLA data do not currently\nhave data available with comparable resolution at millimeter wavelengths\nto verify pure dust emission associated at shorter wavelengths.\nSensitive, high-resolution data (0\\farcs3; 5x coarser than the VLA \nA-configuration data) do exist for a few sources. L1448 IRS2 (Per-emb-22),\nL1448 IRS3 (A,B, and C), and NGC 1333 IRAS2A (Per-emb-27) were observed at 0\\farcs3 resolution at\n1.3 mm by \\citet{tobin2015,tobin2015b}. NGC 1333 IRAS4A was observed by \\citet{looney2000} and \\citet{jorgensen2007}\nat 2.7 mm and 1.3 mm, respectively.\n\nFor L1448 IRS2, the companion separated by 0\\farcs75 that was detected in the VANDAM data is not detected\nat 1.3 mm. The 1.3 mm emission is, however, extended toward the\n companion position. L1448 IRS3B was found to be a triple system in the VANDAM data, \nwith a close pair separated by 0\\farcs26 and separated from the main source\nby 0\\farcs9 \\citep{tobin2015b}. At 1.3mm, the main source is detected and the close\npair is well-resolved from the main source; the close pair themselves are marginally resolved. \nL1448 IRS3C, which is identified in the VANDAM data as a close binary (0\\farcs25)\nis marginally resolved at 1.3 mm, having a deconvolved\nposition angle consistent with the orientation of the multiple system.\nNGC 1333 IRAS2A (Per-emb-27) has a companion separated by 0\\farcs62 and there\nis a marginal (5$\\sigma$) detection at 1.3 mm at the companion location. Lastly, the\nmore widely separated companion toward NGC 1333 IRAS4A (1\\farcs8) \nis detected at 2.7 mm, 1.3 mm, and at $\\sim$850 \\micron\\ \n\\citep{lay1995}.\n\nWhile these are only a few examples, as a whole we can suggest that multiplicity\nat millimeter wavelengths is often also reflected at 8~mm and 1~cm, but not in all cases.\nThe companions toward L1448 IRS2 and NGC 1333 IRAS2A (Per-emb-22-B and Per-emb-27-B) \nwere undetected or marginally detected at 1.3~mm, \nindicating that there is less than $\\sim$0.001 $M_{\\sun}$, of compact mass traced by dust emission\nsurrounding both of these companions (assuming \\citet{ossenkopf1994} \ndust opacities, a dust to gas mass ratio of 1:100, and a dust\ntemperature of 20 K). The estimated flux densities from dust \nemission at 8~mm from these two sources would be 22 {\\mbox{$\\mu$Jy}}\\ and \n8 {\\mbox{$\\mu$Jy}}\\ for Per-emb-22-B and Per-emb-27-B, respectively. \nThis would be below our sensitivity, thus the detected emission\nat 8 mm must have a significant contribution from free-free emission. \nAt longer wavelengths,  \nIRAS2A VLA2 (Per-emb-27-B) is detected at 4~cm, but not \n6.4~cm \\citep{tobin2015}.\n\nThe detection of free-free emission is strong evidence for the presence of\na protostellar source driving at jet. Therefore, the most likely explanation\nfor their lack of strong millimeter emission is a lack of concentrated circumstellar \ndust or compact, optically thick circumstellar dust. This may imply that any circumstellar\ndisk around these companions is quite low mass.\nWithout significant circumstellar dust, it is unlikely that ALMA will be able to detect\nsuch companion sources out of the extended circumstellar dust surrounding\nthe primary protostars. Therefore, to gain a complete picture of multiplicity,\nobservations at longer wavelengths where other emission mechanisms contribute to the \nemergent flux are crucial to fully characterizing protostellar multiplicity.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Potential Bias in Millimeter/Centimeter Characterizations of Multiplicity}\n\nThe methods of characterizing multiplicity toward Class 0 protostars are fundamentally different\nfrom those typically employed to characterize multiplicity of Class I and more-evolved systems. Direct-detection\nof stellar or inner-disk radiation can be employed in most cases to characterize the multiplicity \ntoward Class I and more evolved systems. Moreover,\nadaptive optics and other high-contrast imaging techniques can be used to identify close multiples, in addition to \nradial velocity monitoring. These techniques cannot be employed for Class 0 and early Class I protostellar\nsystems due to the high extinction through the protostellar envelopes and the large amount of scattered light emission\ntypically associated with young stars.\n\n\nCharacterizing multiplicity in protostellar systems relies on the \nindirect methods of detecting circumstellar dust emission and/or free-free \nemission, with the implicit assumption that multiple sources in the emission maps reflect\ndiscrete protostellar objects. Dust emission is expected to reflect dense\nconcentrations of dust in the form of a circumstellar disk or \nan inner envelope near the individual protostars \\citep[e.g.,][]{rodriguez1998, terebey1997,looney2000,chen2013}.\nHowever, a clump of material in a protostellar disk or envelope does not\nnecessarily harbor a protostellar source and it is unknown whether such clumps will form a protostellar source.\nFor free-free emission, it is necessary to assume that the\nemission is originating from shocks near the base of the protostellar jet on $<$ 10 AU scales \\citep{curiel1989,anglada1998}.\n\n\nMultiplicity characterized by dust emission assumes that the protostellar sources either have increasing \ndensity toward them or compact, emission from a circumstellar disk. The fundamental problem with using dust emission\nto characterize multiplicity lies in the assumption that peaks in the millimeter dust emission harbor protostellar\nsources. \nWe fail to detect some previously reported multiplicity in some Class 0 systems (see Appendix C.13),\nbut our results are consistent with the millimeter detections in most cases, \nespecially for the wider multiples detected by \\citet{looney2000} and\n\\citet{chen2013}. We emphasize that caution will be needed when interpreting continuum data in the ALMA era given\nthat sensitivity is typically $>$10$\\times$ better than was possible with PdBI/NOEMA, CARMA, and the SMA. ALMA data are already\nenabling many more low-surface brightness features to be detected, which may or may not harbor or go on to form protostars\n\\citep[e.g., L1521F; ][]{tokuda2014}. \n\nThe dust emission detected in our VLA survey is largely immune from the detection \nof low-surface brightness, extended sources due to our observations\nat high resolution, requiring that dust emission be quite concentrated to be detected, let alone not be resolved-out. However,\nnote the case of Per-emb-18 where we detected an extended dust structure that does not appear to harbor a companion, but its appearance is\nquite distinct from that of point-like emission. Per-emb-2 also has a very extended and apparently clumpy structure and most of this extended\nemission is resolved-out at higher resolution. Moreover, we are typically detecting a \ncombination of dust and free-free emission at Ka-band. This is demonstrated by the spectral index being less\nthan 2 (Figure \\ref{cumulat-spindex}). The addition of free-free emission is advantageous because\nit enhances the detectability of the protostars.\n\nWe can conclude that there are not likely many false detections in our sample from \nfree-free emission associated with outflow shocks. The \nstrong outflows toward SVS13, IRAS2A, L1448C, IRAS4A, and HH211 do not \nyield detections of Ka-band emission associated with shock knots in the\noutflows. Furthermore, the close companion to SVS13 (SVS13A2) does not exhibit \nsignificant proper motion away from SVS13A \\citep{carrasco2008b}, nor is it associated\nwith a shock feature in high-resolution near-infrared imaging \\citep{hodapp2014}. \nWe have also examined the distribution\nof spectral indices in the Ka-band of the close multiples ($<$ 500 AU separations) \nrelative to the single sources, and the histograms\nand cumulative distributions are quite comparable. We performed an AD test on \nthe samples to see how likely the are to be drawn from the same distribution.\nThe resulting probabilities are 0.7 and 0.35 for the integrated and peak spectral indices, respectively, indicating\nthat the spectral indices for the singles and multiples are likely drawn from the same distribution. Thus, we argue that\nthe Ka-band data are unlikely to have significant numbers of false companions.\n\n\nThe characterization of multiplicity from both dust emission and free-free emission has potential\npitfalls. Both methods can lead to detections of sources that are not truly protostellar and both can also \nyield non-detections toward genuine protostellar sources. Therefore, the biases associated \nwith the characterization of multiplicity are difficult to quantify\nand correct for. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Completeness Limits}\n\nThe discussion in Section 5.6 illustrates the difficulties in quantifying the incompleteness of\nour multiplicity detections given that dust and free-free emission process are not directly\nconnected to physical properties of the source, i.e., protostellar mass. The best, albeit poor, proxy\nfor mass is L$_{bol}$, and this value can only be determined for the system as a whole, not individual\ncomponents of multiple systems separated by $<$~1000~AU. Figure \\ref{sample-flux8} shows the histograms of L$_{bol}$ and plots of 8~mm flux\ndensity versus L$_{bol}$. These figures show that the few non-detections in our Class 0 and Class I protostellar\nsamples are typically the lower luminosity sources. In the case of the Class 0 sources, many of the non-detections are\ncandidate FHSCs. However, we cannot simply assign a minimum luminosity that we can detect\nbecause some of the lowest luminosity sources are well-detected. Furthermore, the single sources similarly show \na broad scatter in terms of 8 mm flux density at a given luminosity. This makes us unable to assign a lower-limit to the\nluminosity of companions that we are able to detect from single sources, nor can we provide a lower mass limit.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it is possible that there may be non-detections of some \ncompanions due to a lack of concentrated dust emission and/or\nfree-free emission toward some companions. Given that we are examining\nmultiplicity from indirect methods that do not directly correlate with source\nproperties, the level of incompleteness cannot be quantified with \nany degree of accuracy, nor can we give sensitivity limits as a \nfunction of mass ratio and separation. Thus, the multiplicity \nstatistics derived from millimeter/centimeter studies \nshould be further considered as lower limits. \nMoreover, we cannot examine multiplicity at scale \nsmaller than 15 AU, making our MF and CSFs lower limits.\n\n\nWhile we cannot reliably quantify our level of incompleteness, we do \ndetect all the currently known infrared companions \\citep[i.e., EDJ2009-183 and L1448 IRS1][]{connelley2008}\nand most millimeter companions (except for VeLLOs/candidate FHSCs). Furthermore, \nour observed CSF of Class I protostars is consistent with the near-infrared studies. Thus,\nincompleteness may not be a serious issue given the agreement of our results with \nthose obtained from independent techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\nWe have conducted a multi-wavelength VLA survey (8~mm, 1~cm, 4~cm, and 6.4~cm) of all known protostellar systems in\nthe Perseus molecular cloud and presented our results on the\nmultiplicity of the protostellar systems based on our 8 mm and 1 cm data.\nOur survey observed an unprecedented number of systems\nwith uniform sensitivity and resolution in a single star forming region. The high-resolution\ndata taken in A and B configurations have enabled us to carry out a \nrelatively unbiased characterization of\nprotostellar multiplicity down to 15 AU scales for all protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud. \nWe note, however,\nthat the MF, CSF, and companion frequencies with separation \ngiven in this paper are most likely lower limits. \nThis is because of\nthe inherent bias associated with detecting multiplicity from the presence of dust \nor free-free emission toward companions and\nthere are likely unresolved systems at separations smaller than our resolution limit.\n\n1. We detect 18 multiple systems with \nseparations between 15 AU and 500 AU, \nof which 16 are new detections by the VANDAM survey. This increases \nthe number of known Class 0 systems with companion\nseparations between 15 AU and 500 AU \nby more than a factor of two.\n\n2. The distribution of protostellar companion separations in Perseus appears\nbi-modal or double-peaked, with one peak at $\\sim$75 AU and the second peak\nat $\\sim$3000 AU. We argue that the double-peaked distribution is suggestive of two formation mechanisms for the \nwide and close multiple systems, disk fragmentation for scales $\\la$ 300 AU and core/turbulent fragmentation \nfor scales larger than 1000 AU.\n\n\n3. The MF and CSF for separations from 15 AU to 5000 AU (and 10000 AU)  are larger for Class 0 sources than Class I \nsources and field solar-type stars, confirming the results \\citet{chen2013}. However, for separations\n $\\le$ 2000~AU, the MF and CSF of Class 0 sources are consistent with Class I sources \nand field solar-type stars. \n\n\n\n\n4. The distribution of separations for the Class 0 and Class I sources appear different.\nThere is a clear deficit of wide companions toward Class I sources relative to\nClass 0 sources, which we interpret as evidence for evolution of companion \nseparations between the Class 0 and Class I phases.\nSystems could either form or become unbound as the star forming gas is dispersed. Alternatively,\nwide companions could migrate inward.\nHowever, the MF and CSF for Class 0 and I protostars are consistent with each other\non scales between 15 AU and 2000 AU. \nTherefore, a significant fraction of multiples may not be \nmigrating inward from $>$1000 AU separations. \n\n5. We detect companions embedded within extended dust continuum structures toward 3 systems \n(Per-emb-2/IRAS 03292+3039, Per-emb-5/IRAS 03282+3035, and Per-emb-18); the companions\nare separated by $\\le$30 AU. We interpret this structure as evidence \non-going disk fragmentation in these systems, given that the\ncompanion sources are found within a larger surrounding structure. \nThough the surrounding structures are not confirmed to be rotationally-supported, this is the first observed\nevidence for such small-scale substructure toward young protostars.\n\n6. WE compared our distribution of separations to the Taurus pre-main sequence samples from \\citet{kraus2011}.\nThe separation distribution for the Perseus sample is more consistent with the high-mass Taurus sub-sample \n(2.5 $M_{\\sun}$ $\\ge$ $M_*$ $>$ 0.7 $M_{\\sun}$) than their low-mass \nsub-sample ($M_*$ $<$ 0.7 $M_{\\sun}$). The primary difference is the number of wide companions.\nIf the wide systems in Perseus are not bound, then the separation distribution may evolve to be more consistent\nwith the Taurus low-mass sub-sample. \nWe caution, however, that the comparisons of Perseus\nand Taurus may not be valid given the differences in the star formation conditions.\n\n\n7. While millimeter observations of the newly discovered multiple systems are not complete,\nboth L1448 IRS2 and NGC 1333 IRAS2A have existing 1.3 mm observations with sufficient resolution\nto resolve the VLA-detected companions. However, the companions are not convincingly detected\nat 1.3 mm. This result carries the implication that ALMA may not be able to completely \ncharacterize protostellar multiplicity because not all protostellar companions\nwill be detectable. Moreover, optically thick dust emission on $<$100 AU scales \nmay inhibit the detection of embedded companions separated by $<$50 AU at \nmillimeter/submillimeter wavelengths.\n\n8. We demonstrate that close companions are likely to be real sources and not knots of free-free emission in the outflows. \nFirst there is a lack of correlation between \ncompanion separation and relative position angle between the outflow and companions, and secondly the distribution of spectral indices\nfor companion sources is consistent with having the same distribution as single protostellar sources.\nWhile we cannot absolutely rule-out the possibility that some companions are features of the protostellar jet interacting\nwith the surrounding cloud, proper motion studies can be carried out on timescales of a few years to determine\nwhether or not the sources move in the jet direction or if the companion sources are co-moving. Orbital motion will likely require longer\ntime baselines of order 10-20 years to determine.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee for constructive suggestions that improved the\nquality of the manuscript.

The A+B configuration\nimages, tapered at 1000 k$\\lambda$ are shown in the left panel, emphasizing the structured \nextended emission; the extent of the resolved structure agrees with the 1.3 mm observation\npresented by \\citet{tobin2015b}. When zooming in on the inner region in the middle panel \nwith the A-configuration-only image, the extended structure is resolved-out. \nThe main source appears extended and another source clearly detected with a separation of 18.5 AU\nwhen imaged with Briggs weighting, shown in the right panel of Figure \\ref{IRAS03292}. \nThe spectral index is $\\sim$2 at the peak intensity, \nbut the extensions north and east have steeper spectral slopes indicative of dust emission. In the higher resolution\nimages, the eastern source has a spectral index of $\\sim$3, while the western source has a spectral index of $\\sim$1.5.\nThe shallower spectral index is an indication that both dust and free-free emission are contributing to the\nsource flux.\n\n\\subsection{Per-emb-5/IRAS 03282+3035}\nPer-emb-5 (IRAS 03282+3035) is shown in Figure \\ref{IRAS03282}; it is resolved\nat lower resolutions in the left panels of Figure \\ref{IRAS03282},\nbut the emission is not as extended as Per-emb-2. The middle panels of\nFigure \\ref{IRAS03282} begin to show double-peaked structure with a separation\nof 22.3 AU. The highest resolution data in the upper right panel also\nshows that the eastern peak is resolved. The eastern source also has a steeper spectral index ($\\sim$3),\nindicative of dust emission being the dominant emission component. The spectral index of the western\nsource is shallower ($\\sim$1), suggesting that it has a larger contribution from free-free emission than the eastern source. \n\n\\subsection{Per-emb-18}\nPer-emb-18 (NGC 1333 IRAS 7), shown in Figure \\ref{Per18}, \nshows an apparent secondary source in the low-resolution \nimage in the left panels of Figure \\ref{Per18} with a separation of $\\sim$84 AU. When viewed \nat higher resolution in the middle panels, the apparent secondary source appears\nresolved-out and is most likely an extended dust structure; thus, we do not consider it as a companion source.\nHowever, the main source then shows evidence of \nresolved structure.  The upper right panel of Figure \\ref{Per18} appears \ndouble peaked with a separation of 19.6 AU. Both sources have shallow\nspectral indices indicating that free-free emission is dominating at the source location\nand there is evidence for a steeper spectral index between the sources, suggesting dust emission between the two sources.\n\n\n\\section{Possible Close Multiples}\n\nIn addition to the clear multiples that are presented in the main text, there are several sources for which\nresolved structure is apparent, but the significance of the detections are below the 5$\\sigma$ criteria or only\ndetected in one band. We show these sources in Figure \\ref{poss-multiples}. These sources are only revealed at \nthe highest resolutions or only with the increased sensitivity of the combined A and B configuration data. These may be\nresolved disk structures or possibly bonafide companions and their nature may be further revealed by higher sensitivity imaging.\n\n\\section{Notes on Multiple Sources with $>$ 500 AU Separations and Specific Multiple Systems}\n\n\\subsection{IC348 MMS}\nIC348 MMS/Per-emb-11 was previously identified as a multiple system with 15\\arcsec\\ separation by \\citet{chen2013};\nthe VLA 9 mm image is shown in Figure \\ref{IC348MMS-wide}. \n\\citet{rodriguez2014} also identified another source separated by $\\sim$3\\arcsec\\ southwest \nat 2.1 cm and 3.3 cm (JVLA3a); the brightest source in Figure \\ref{IC348MMS-wide} is associated with Per-emb-11-A\nat the center of the image and denoted JVLA3b by \\citet{rodriguez2014}. \nJVLA3a/Per-emb-11-B appears coincident with the MIPS 24 \\micron\\ source, and it is directly \nbetween outflow cavities evident at shorter wavelengths \\citep{pech2012}. JVLA3b/Per-emb-11-A seems to be\nlocated to the side of the outflow cavity and \\citet{pech2012} \nshowed CO outflow possibly misaligned with knots observed at IRAC wavelengths. Finally,\n\\citet{tobin2015b} presented 1.3 mm imaging toward IC348 MMS with 0\\farcs3 resolution and 1 mJy sensitivity;\nthe 1.3 mm emission toward JVLA3b is well-detected, but JVLA3a is not. \nA reexamination of the image finds that\nthere is indeed a 3$\\sigma$ peak at the position of JVLA3a at 1.3~mm. \nThe spectral index of JVLA3a/Per-emb-11-B\nis positive in Ka-band as well as from 3.3~cm to 2.1~cm, but overall shallow. Thus, JVLA3a may be protostellar in\nnature but with faint continuum emission at 1.3 mm. Finally, JVLA 3c from \\citet{rodriguez2014} \nalso coincides with the wide companion\nPer-emb-11-C, a possible proto-brown dwarf suggested by \\citet{palau2014}.\n\n\\subsection{NGC 1333 IRAS4B}\nThe wide multiple system of IRAS 4B and IRAS 4B$^{\\prime}$ is well detected \nby the VLA at 9mm (Figure \\ref{IRAS4B-wide}), with a separation of 2450 AU. \nBoth sources have resolved structure at this wavelength. Compact outflows originating from the two\nsources were identified by \\citet{hull2014}, and they are in nearly orthogonal directions.\n\n\\subsection{Per-emb-16 and Per-emb-28}\nPer-emb-16 and Per-emb-28 comprise a wide multiple system in the IC348 region. Per-emb-16 is a Class 0 object and Per-emb-28 is classified\nas a Class 0/I source. Per-emb-28 is notable because it shows a high degree of periodic variability, possibly\nfrom pulsed accretion \\citep{muzerolle2013}. Both sources are rather faint at 9 mm, see Figure \\ref{Per16-Per28-wide}.\n\n\\subsection{NGC 1333 IRAS7}\nWithin the system collectively known as NGC 1333 IRAS7, Per-emb-18, Per-emb-21, \nand Per-emb-49 are found to comprise a quintuple system, see Figure \\ref{IRAS7-wide}.\nBoth Per-emb-18 and Per-emb-49 have companions separated by less than 100 AU and Per-emb-21 is single.\nPer-emb-49 appears to be a Class I source, while Per-emb-18 and Per-emb-21 are Class 0 objects. Per-emb-18\nappears to drive a long system of HH objects, while Per-emb-21 has a relatively compact outflow \\citep{davis2008}.\n\n\\subsection{L1448C}\nWe detected both components of the L1448C system, Per-emb-26 (L1448C-N) \nand Per-emb-42 (L1448C-S), see Figure \\ref{L1448C-wide}. These\nsources were previously resolved by \\textit{Spitzer} observations \\citep{jorgensen2006,tobin2007}\nand at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths \\citep{hirano2010,maury2010}. \nPer-emb-42/L1448C-S is located in the direction of the outflow\nfrom Per-emb-26/L1448C-N; however, an independent outflow is found to \noriginate from Per-emb-42/L1448C-S \\citep{hirano2010}. Per-emb-42 may be more evolved than \nL1448C, given that it is classified as a Class I by \\citet{enoch2009}.\n\n\n\\subsection{L1448N/IRS3}\nThe L1448 IRS3 (also known as L1448-N) system comprises Per-emb-33 (L1448 IRS3B), L1448 IRS3A, and L1448NW, the\nthree components are within a radius of 5000 AU, see Figure \\ref{L1448N-wide}. \nA companion in the Class 0 system L1448 IRS3B (Per-emb-33) had been reported \nby \\citet{tobin2015b}, but the VLA observations have resolved the secondary into two distinct sources making\nPer-emb-33 a triple.\nL1448NW is also found to be a binary in our study, the previous CARMA observations of \\citet{tobin2015b} \nhad noted that this source was extended. Thus, the system as a whole is a sextuple.\nL1448NW is the most widely\nseparated system from the rest, 4946 AU from Per-emb-33 and 3749 AU from L1448 IRS3A. Per-emb-33 and L1448NW \nare both Class 0 systems and L1448 IRS3A is likely Class I.\nThen Per-emb-26 (L1448C) is $\\sim$18500 AU south of Per-emb-33 and Per-emb-22 is $\\sim$41000 AU (0.2 pc) to the west.\nThe kinematics and outflows of this system are analyzed in detail by \\citet{lee2015}.\n\n\n\\subsection{SVS13}\nThe SVS13 (HH 7-11 region)is comprised of\nthree main sources: SVS13A, B and C, as denoted by \\citet{looney2000}, see Figure \\ref{SVS13-wide}.\nPer-emb-44 (SVS13A) is the driving source of HH 7-11 and the companion SVS13B was first\ntentatively identified by \\citet{grossman1987}; subsequent maps of the region by \\citet{chini1997} \nconfirmed the detection of SVS13B and identified the source that is now known as SVS13C as MMS3. \\citet{looney2000}\nconfirmed all of these detections with interferometry at 2.7 mm. SVS13B is $\\sim$3400 AU \nfrom SVS13A and SVS13C is $\\sim$ 4500 AU from SVS13B. \n\nPer-emb-44 (SVS13A) itself is a close binary \\citep[first discovered by ][]{rodriguez1999}\nand it has another companion 1222 AU away which we refer to as SVS13A2 \\citep[also known as VLA3 ][]{anglada2004}.\n\\citet{carrasco2008} examined the proper motions of sources in this region and found that SVS13A2 is indeed co-moving\nwith the other sources and not likely to be an outflow ejection.\nPer-emb-44 is classified as Class I, but its outflow power\nis comparable to Class 0 sources \\citep{plunkett2013}. SVS13B and SVS13C \nalso appear to be Class 0 sources \\citep{sadavoy2014}, but their nature\nis more uncertain given their close proximity Per-emb-44, a \nbright source from the near to far-infrared, making photometry difficult.\nFinally, another source is apparent northeast of Per-emb-44 in \nFigure \\ref{SVS13-wide}, denoted VLA20 by \\citet{rodriguez1999}. This\nsource had been classified as a YSO by those authors given its \nrising spectral index, but no counterpart is detected in the\ninfrared \\citep[e.g.,][]{jorgensen2006} or the millimeter \\citep{looney2000}.\n We find that this source has a flat spectral index in Ka-band; this and \nthe lack of counterparts at millimeter and infrared wavelengths indicate\nthat this source is most likely extragalactic in nature and we do not \nconsider it in the multiplicity statistics.\n\n\\subsection{NGC 1333 IRAS2B}\n\nNGC 1333 IRAS2B has an apparent companion separated by 3\\farcs8 ($\\sim$870 AU), in addition to the 72.5 AU companion\nsource, see Figure \\ref{IRAS2B-wide}. However, the more widely separated source does not appear to be physically associated\nwith the IRAS2B system.\nIts position is coincident with an optically visible star (BD +30 547)\nthat appears to be illuminating the near side of the dark cloud and\nnot embedded like IRAS 2B, suggesting that this is a line-of-sight\nalignment \\citep{rodriguez1999}. Therefore, we do not consider the more \nwidely separated source in the multiplicity statistics. However, BD +30 547 could be a Class III\nsource given that it appears to be located physically close to the molecular cloud. BD +30 547 also has\na negative spectral index, possibly indicative of gyrosynchrotron emission from an active corona \\citep{dulk1985}.\n\n\\subsection{ Per-emb-8 and Per-emb-55}\nPer-emb-8 and Per-emb-55 form another Class 0 - Class I wide binary system separated by \n$\\sim$2200 AU. \nPer-emb-55 itself is a close binary,separated by 142 AU,\nsee Figure \\ref{Per8-wide}. Per-emb-55 is\nquite bright in the IRAC bands, while Per-emb-8 is faint and shows some diffuse emission.\n\n\\subsection{Barnard 1-b Region}\nThe B1-b region comprises the three sources B1-bN, B1-bS, and \nPer-emb-41, see Figure \\ref{B1-wide}. Both B1-bN and B1-bS have been suggested\nto be candidate first hydrostatic core objects and are faint even at 70 \\micron; B1-bS is also\nquite faint at 100 \\micron\\ \\citep{pezzuto2012}. Per-emb-41 appears to be more \nevolved and is classified as Class I, having bright emission at IRAC wavelengths.\n\n\\subsection{Per-emb-37}\nPer-emb-37 was mentioned in Section 2 because it is a Class 0 source that had been incorrectly associated with a brighter\nIRAC source and subsequently classified as Class I. \\citet{sadavoy2014} also detected this source in their search for\nClass 0 sources in Perseus. We do not detect all the infrared-associated sources in the 8 mm image, see Figure \\ref{Per37-wide}, \nbut two sources are detected at 8~mm with separations of 2428 AU and 7752 AU. \nThus, Per-emb-37 is the only new wide multiple\nreported in this study.\n\n\n\\subsection{Per-emb-35}\nPer-emb-35, also known as NGC 1333 IRAS1, is located on the western outskirts of NGC 1333. It is particularly\ninteresting that this source is found to be a $\\sim$440~AU binary (Figure 1), \ngiven that it is also found to have a apparent S-shaped outflow\nin the \\textit{Spitzer} image of the region \\citep{gutermuth2008}. \nThus, the companion could pay a role in shaping the outflow morphology.\n\n\n\\subsection{Non-Detections Toward Previously Reported Multiples}\nThere are a few cases where multiplicity has been previously reported toward sources\nin Perseus, but we do not confirm the presence of companion sources. One notable case is NGC 1333 IRAS2A (Per-emb-27) where\na candidate companion was reported by \\citet{codella2014} and \\citet{maury2014}, along\nwith a non-protostellar continuum source. As discussed extensively in \\citet{tobin2015},\nwe did not detect these sources in the VLA data nor at 1.3 mm and 850 \\micron, despite having \nsufficient sensitivity at all wavelengths given their measurement of the spectral index. We did, however,\ndiscover a new companion with our VLA data separated by 142 AU. Thus, it is likely that the\nnew VLA-detected companion is the driving source of the second outflow from this system\n\\citep{sandell1994} and that the other reported sources are spurious; see\n\\citet{tobin2015} for more details.\n\n\nHH211-mms (Per-emb-1) was reported to have a candidate companion separated by 0\\farcs3 ($\\sim$69~AU)\nin \\citet{lee2009} and \\citet{chen2013} with 870 \\micron\\ data. We failed to detect a companion toward this \nsource in our VLA data. Moreover, the companion is not detected in CARMA 3 mm A-array\ndata with 0\\farcs3 resolution (H.-F. Chiang, private communication). The lack of detection at multiple wavelengths\ncasts doubt on the robustness of the claimed companion. It was only detected in an\nimage generated with super-uniform weighting and could be spurious.\n The flux density of the companion\nat 870~\\micron\\ is 25~mJy; assuming optically thin emission and a dust opacity spectral index of 3, the\nestimated peak flux density at 8.1~mm is 31 {\\mbox{$\\mu$Jy}}\\ at about our 3$\\sigma$ sensitivity limit. Therefore, \nthe source detected by \\citet{lee2009} could be a dust clump that is most apparent at 870 \\micron.\n\n\nFinally, \\citet{chen2013} reported a companion toward IRAS 03282+3035 (Per-emb-5) separated by 1\\farcs5 (345 AU) \nat 870 \\micron. We did not detect a companion at this\nlocation in our VLA data, nor did \\citet{tobin2015b} detect this source at 1.3 mm. Thus, the lack of\ndetection at multiple wavelengths suggests that this companion is likely spurious.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{small}\n\\bibliographystyle{apj}\n\\bibliography{ms}\n\\end{small}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1b.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1c.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1d.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1e.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1f.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1g.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1h.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1i.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1j.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1k.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.33]{f1l.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Images of multiple systems with separations $<$ 500 AU.\n The images are produced \nfrom the combined A and B configuration data.
