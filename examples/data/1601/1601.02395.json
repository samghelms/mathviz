We determined a rotation period \nof P\\,=\\,11.594$\\pm$0.017\\,h and amplitude of $\\Delta$m\\,=\\,0\\fm0328$\\pm$0\\fm0018,\nconfirming previous short rotation periods obtained in ground based observations. \nThe similarities of light curve amplitudes between 2001 and 2015 show that Nereid is \nin a low-amplitude rotation state nowadays and it could have been\nin a high-amplitude rotation state in the mid 1960's. Another high-amplitude\nperiod is expected in about 30 years. Based on the light curve amplitudes observed\nin the last 15 years we could constrain the shape of Nereid and obtained \na maximum $a$:$c$ axis ratio of 1.3:1. This excludes the previously suggested\nvery elongated shape of $a$:$c$\\,$\\approx$\\,1.9:1 and clearly shows that Nereid's\nspin axis cannot be in forced precession due to tidal forces. Thermal emission data\nfrom the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory indicate that \nNereid's shape is actually close to the $a$:$c$ axis ratio limit of 1.3:1 we obtained, \nand it has a very rough, highly cratered surface. \n\n \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\nmethods: observational --- \n\t\ttechniques: photometric --- \n\t\tastrometry --- \n\t\tplanets and satellites: individual: Neptune II Nereid \t\t\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sect:introduction}\nNereid is a large, $\\sim$350\\,km sized, \nirregular satellite orbiting Neptune in a very eccentric and inclined \norbit \\citep{Dobrovolskis,Jacobson2009}. \nAlthough its orbital characteristics are well known, there is still \na mistery related to its shape, orientation and rotation rate. \nThere have been several papers reporting on unusual, in some cases large amplitude \nbrightness variations of Nereid on different timescales, from night-to-night\nvariations to changes on annual scales. These investigations are nicely summarised and discussed \nin \\citet{Schaefer2008}. In this paper the authors' preferred solution that could\nexplain the photometric variability was that year-to-year variations are caused by\nNereid's pole precessing, in some years Nereid's pole pointing towards Earth while in other years \nnearly perpendicular to the line of sight. Physically this could be explained by \nforced precession, due to Neptune's tidal torque on a non-spherical\nNereid. This would require high, 1.9:1 or greater axis ratios. \n\n\\citet{Hesselbrock2013} attempted to model the rotation of Nereid in a way similar to \n\\citet{Schaefer2008}, but also considering\nthe effect of smaller bodies in addition to the Sun and Neptune, especially that of Triton. \nTheir \"best estimate\" solution is a triaxial ellipsoid with semiaxis ratios of \nc/a$\\sim$0.5, b/a$\\sim$0.6, an inital obliquity of $\\sim$60\\degr{} and an initial \nrotation period of 144\\,h. Their model predicts \"active\" and \"inactive\" periods, depending\non the actual direction of the main spin axis \n(c-axis aspect angles of $\\sim$90\\degr{} and $\\sim$0\\degr, respectively), matching the \nphotometry data collected in \\citet{Schaefer2008} qualitatively, however, with some\ndifferences in the predicted brightness levels compared with the observed ones. \nThey explain this latter discrepancy by an additional effect of a non-uniform albedo\ndistribution. Their model predicts a $\\sim$15-year time between the two extreme orientations.  \n\nWhile the shape of Nereid would be essential for the rotation evolution\nmodels, this is not known. \\citet{Thomas1991} derived a size of 350$\\pm$50\\,km from\nVoyager-2 flyby observations in which Nereid was resolved to some level, \nbut the quality of the data  was not good enough to constrain the shape \n\\citep[see also][for a discussion]{Schaefer2008}. \n\nBased on observations in August 2001 and August 2002 \\citet{Grav2003} derived \na short rotation period of P\\,=\\,11\\fh52 for Nereid with a small peak-to-peak \nlight curve amplitude of 0\\fm029$\\pm$0.003. This rotation period was later questionned \nby \\citet{Schaefer2008} due to the relatively poor sampling of the rotation curve, \nand has not been included in the analysis by \\citet{Hesselbrock2013} either.  \n\\citet{Terai} obtained a very similar light curve \n($\\Delta$m\\,=\\,0\\fm031$\\pm$0\\fm001, P\\,=\\,11\\fh50$\\pm$0\\fh10)\nbased on observations in 2008, but their light curve was sparsely \nsampled in terms of rotational phase. \n\nAs shown above, ground based observations have not placed a strong constraint on\nthe rotation of Nereid. However, as it has been demonstrated in some recent \npapers \\citep{pal2015,pal2015c}, data from\nthe extended Kepler mission \\citep[K2,][]{howell2014} \ncan be very effectively used to obtain rotational light\ncurves of distant Solar System bodies due to uninterrupted photometric time series\nof several tens of days in length. Given that Neptune, and therefore Nereid as well, was\nincluded in the Campaign~3 observations of the K2 mission, we attempted to obtain \nthe light curve of Nereid from these observations. \nIn addition to the light curve data, we collected archival Spitzer Space \nTelescope and Herschel Space Observatory data to detect the \nthermal emission of Nereid in the mid- and far-infrared (24--160\\,$\\mu$m)\nwavelength ranges. In this paper, with the synergy of the light curve information \nand thermal emission data, we put important constraints on the rotational state, \nshape, as well as on other physical properties of Nereid.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{The Kepler K2 light curve}\n\n\\subsection{K2 observations}\n\\label{sect:observations}\n\n{\\it Kepler} observed Nereid during the third campaign of the extended mission,\nnamed K2 \\citep{howell2014}. In this K2 mission,\n{\\it Kepler} targets fields near the Ecliptic, observing each field for\napproximately three months. This quarterly schedule allows the continuous\nobservations of Solar System bodies if sufficiently large arcs are allocated\nin the CCD mosaic of the {\\it Kepler} space telescope. Main-belt asteroids\nhave a large apparent motion (comparable to or even larger than the total \nfield-of-view of the space telescope). In addition, main-belt asteroids have a \nnon-negligible noise source on the photometry of stellar \ntargets \\citep{szabo2015}. However, minor bodies outside the main-belt\n-- such as Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects -- can be observed with a \nrelatively low pixel budget. In addition, the pixel budget can even be \nminimized around the stationary point, where masks with a size of \n$\\sim20\\times20$ pixels can be sufficient to follow trans-Neptunian objects\nup to $10-15$ days \\citep{pal2015}. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\resizebox{80mm}{!}{\\includegraphics{nereid-field}}\n\\caption{\nThe field-of-view of {\\it Kepler}, showing the field \nin which Neptune and Nereid was apparently moving during the K2 \nCampaign 3. The stars involved in the determination of the absolute\nand differential astrometric solutions are indicated by red circles.\nThe small blue circles indicate the position of Nereid with a \n$1$-day stepsize throughout the observations.\nThe total size of the field is $475\\times190$ pixels, i.e. \n$\\sim 32^\\prime\\times13^\\prime$. This image is shown in the CCD frame,\nhence the image is flipped with respect to the standard view.\n}\n\\label{fig:nereidfield}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn the case of Nereid, a nearly parallelogram-shaped field was allocated for\n{\\it Kepler}/K2 observations. This field includes the apparent track of\nboth Neptune and Nereid and has a size of $456\\times 80$ pixels.\nThis field is located on {\\it Kepler} module \\#13 and read out by \nits output amplifier \\#2 (i.e. channel \\#42 considering the full mosaic array).\nIn order to analyze the field, we retrieved the $456$ individual data \nframes corresponding to the columns of this parallelogram-shaped CCD area.\nThereafter, we built the individual image frames on a rectangular\narea having a size of $475\\times190$. This area safely covers the \nparallelogram and includes some additional rows and columns in order to have\nsame extra space for frame registration. In total, the corresponding data\nseries contains $3336$ individual and useable long-cadence frames. The total\nnumber of frames for Campaign 3 were $3386$, but $50$ frames had to be\ndropped due to lack of data or inappropriate tracking during the exposure.\n\nDue to the lack of a third active reaction wheel, the positioning jitter of\n{\\it Kepler}/K2 is significantly larger than what it had been during the main\nmission. Therefore, the $3336$ frames have to be analyzed independently\nin order to retrieve the proper astrometric solution as well as to\nperform an image registration needed by the subsequent steps of differential\nphotometry. To accomplish this astrometry, we selected nearly a dozen \nreference stars distributed uniformly in the field. Due to the large size\nof the field, we did not include additional stamps for this purpose\n\\citep[see e.g. the case of {2007\\,OR\\ensuremath{_{10}}}{},][]{pal2015c}. These stars were\nused to perform both the differential astrometry (i.e. the frame registration)\nand the absolute astrometry (i.e. finding the plate solution w.r.t.\nthe J2000 system). The absolute plate solution has been derived by cross-matching\nthe pixel coordinates of the selected reference stars with the\nUSNO-B catalogue \\citep{monet2003}.\nThese $11$ stars were also used to \ntransform {\\it Kepler}/K2 photometry to USNO-B1 R system. The USNO magnitudes\nof these star cover the range of $R=13.2\\dots17.8$, nearly homogeneously.\nSince an unfiltered CCD efficiency curve can be considered as a ``wide R''\nband, the comparison of the USNO magnitudes with the instrumental ones\nyielded a fit residual of $0.12$ magnitudes. Therefore, we can state that the\naccuracy of this transformation is in this range.\n\n\nIn all other aspects, the data reduction and photometry were conducted\nin a similar manner as it was described in \\cite{pal2015} or \\cite{pal2015c}.\nOur photometric pipeline used for {\\it Kepler} frame reconstruction, source\nextraction, astrometry and cross-matching, image registration and\ndifferential photometry are based on the various tasks of the FITSH\npackage \\citep{pal2012}. The folded light curve (with the period of \n$11.594\\,{\\rm h}$, see Sect.~\\ref{sect:analysis}) of Nereid is shown \nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:lc}.\nWe note here that the formal photometric \nuncertainities on the individual frames increased from $0.012$ up to \n$0.022$ throughout this $\\sim 67$\\,days long campaign. This increment is \ndue to the gradually increasing level of zodiacal light as the elongation of \nNereid decreased from $140^\\circ$ down to $74^\\circ$. This instrumental \nuncertainity can be compared with the statistical one computed from the \nroot mean square deviation of the photometric data points on each of the $N=20$\nbins on the binned light curve. This latter method gives us an estimation\nof $0.028-0.034$ error for each frame, i.e. slightly larger than the \ninstrumental estimate.\n\n\n\\subsection{Light curve analysis}\n\\label{sect:analysis}\n\nBased on previous studies in the literature, \nthe expected amplitude of the light curve variations are relatively small. \nTherefore, periodicity in the light curve has been searched by \nassuming a sinusoidal function coadded to a linear function representing\nthe gradual fading of the object (due to phase angle and distance variations).\nThis function was defined as \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nA+B\\Delta t+C\\cos(2\\pi n\\Delta t)+D\\sin(2\\pi n\\Delta t),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"A+B\\Delta t+C\\cos(2\\pi n\\Delta t)+D\\sin(2\\pi n\\Delta t),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02395.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\noindent If we assume that the shape of Nereid is a triaxial ellipsoid \nwith semi-axes of $a$\\,$>$\\,$b$\\,$>$\\,$c$ then the object \nseen at a $\\vartheta$ spin axis aspect angle will show a light curve \nwith an amplitude of:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17890, "prevtext": "\nwhere $n$ is the suspected rotational frequency and $\\Delta t$ is the \ntime after $2,457,010\\,{\\rm JD}$ (chosen in order to minimize \nthe rounding errors and numerical artifacts).

The Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS\nobservations are separated by about six years, and, as we have seen above, there were\nindications that the rotational axis, brightness and the apparent shape \nof Nereid may change significantly on this timescale (see Sect.~1). \nHowever, as discussed above, the similarity of our newly detected rotation solution to\nthose by \\citet{Grav2003} and \\citet{Terai} indicates that Nereid has been in a low \nrotational light curve amplitude period in the recent decade that is also \nassociated with relatively small changes in spin axis rotation angle and \nsubsolar latitude configurations. Therefore we feel that the combination of the \nSpitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS data is likely feasible and can\nbetter constrain the radiometry solutions than analysing them separately. \n\nWe characterise the radiometry solutions by calculating the reduced $\\chi^2$ values \nof the fits from the observed and model fluxes of a specific effective diameter\nand beaming parameter combination. We consider a solution \nacceptable if $\\chi^2$\\,$\\le$\\,$(1+\\sigma)^2$, where $\\sigma$ is the\nstandard deviation of the $\\chi^2$ distribution\n\\citep[see e.g.][for a similar application of the method]{Vilenius2014}. \nAlbedo and effective diameter are not independent\nbut are linked by the absolute magnitude. We use H$_V$\\,=\\,4\\fm418$\\pm$0\\fm008, \na weighted average of the absolute magnitudes provided by \\citet{Grav2004} and\n\\citet{Rabinowitz2007}. \n\nFor the sake of completeness, we derived four kind of fits:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item[a)] \\emph{MIPS 24 and 70\\,$\\mu$m only, original 70\\,$\\mu$m flux (MIPS epoch)}. \nIn this case we used input flux derived from the uncorrected \n70\\,$\\mu$m flux, F$_m(70)$\\,=\\,55.0$\\pm$12.7\\,mJy (see Table~\\ref{table:fluxes}). \nThe NEATM fits resulted in a best fit diameter of \nD\\,=\\,605$\\pm$95\\,km, $\\eta$\\,=\\,1.36$\\pm$0.16, and p$_V$\\,=\\,0.081$\\pm$0.027.\n(see the corresponding SED, plotted with dotted line, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:neatmres}a).\nThis diameter is by far larger than any conceivable size for Nereid, and clearly\nindicates that the MIPS 70$\\mu$m flux is strongly contaminated, \nmost likely by the diffraction spikes of Neptune, as discussed in Sect.~\\ref{sect:Spitzer}\nearlier. Therefore this 70\\,$\\mu$m input flux and the related solution is not considered \nany further in our analysis. \n\n\\item[b)] \\emph{MIPS 24 and 70\\,$\\mu$m only, corrected 70\\,$\\mu$m flux (MIPS epoch)}.  \nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:neatmres}b we plot the regions of the acceptable solution\n($\\chi^2$\\,$\\le$\\,$(1+\\sigma)^2$) in the diameter -- beaming parameter space. \nFor Case $b$ this is represented by the area enclosed by dashed lines. \nDue to the large error bar of the 70\\,$\\mu$m flux a wide range of diameters,\nand an especially wide range of beaming parameters are allowed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\item[c)] \\emph{PACS 100 and 160\\,$\\mu$m only (PACS epoch)}. When only the PACS \nmeasurements are considered the situation is somewhat different. \nHere we have a strong correlation of the diameter and\n$\\eta$, but the model is not well constrained due to the lack of short \nwavelength fluxes (region enclosed by dash-dotted lines in \nFig.~\\ref{fig:neatmres}{\\bf{b}}). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\item[d)] \\emph{PACS and MIPS combined (corrected 70\\,$\\mu$m flux, \nboth MIPS and PACS epochs).}\nDue to the similarities of the observing geometries at the dates \nof the MIPS and PACS observations the resulting fluxes of the same \nNEATM model are almost equivalent for the two epochs, and therefore a mean \nobserving geometry can be safely applied on the combined dataset\n(see Table~\\ref{table:obs}). \nWhen all four data points are considered, the NEATM model becomes well \nconstrained. The common solution\n(gray contour ellipses in Fig.~\\ref{fig:neatmres}b) is compatible with\nboth the MIPS-only and the PACS-only solutions (Cases $b$ and $c$).  \nIn this case we obtain D\\,=\\,345$\\pm$15\\,km, \n$\\eta$\\,=\\,0.76$\\pm$0.02, and p$_V$\\,=\\,0.25$\\pm$0.02. This effective diameter \nis very similar to the Voyager-2 flyby value of 350$\\pm$50\\,km \\citep{Thomas1991}.\nThe low $\\chi^2$ value obtained for this combined solution confirms that\nthe $\\eta$ values related to the two epochs are the same to a level\nthat they cannot be distinguished with the current flux uncertainties.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe consider the combined dataset and the solution of Case $d$ \nas the most acceptable size, albedo and beaming parameter for Nereid.\nIt is supported by the light curve analysis / spin axis constraints and \nnone of the other NEATM solutions (Cases $b$ and $c$) \ncontradict with solution $d$ considering all\nthe errors in the NEATM model parameter determination. \n\nUsing our favoured radiometry solution of D\\,=\\,345$\\pm$15\\,km, \n$\\eta$\\,=\\,0.76$\\pm$0.02, and following the relations of thermal parameter, beaming parameter and\nsurface roughness described in Spencer et al. (1989) and Spencer (1990),\nwe can constrain the thermal properties (thermal inertia and surface \nroughness) of Nereid using the NEATM solutions to some level.  \n\nIn the framework of the abovementioned models, a \nbeaming parameter below unity can be explained by surface roughness\neffects. The minimum level of surface roughness beaming contribution\nrequired to obtain $\\eta$\\,=\\,0.76 (our best-fit value) is $\\delta\\eta$\\,=\\,0.24\n(see eq. 7 in Spencer 1990) that corresponds to an r.m.s. surface \nroughness level of $\\rho$\\,=\\,0.6 (Lagerros 1998). Such a surface\ncan also be constructed by considering 90\\degr{} hemispheral \ncraters with 50 per cent surface coverage. To obtain this low $\\eta$, it is, however, \nrequired in addition to the moderately high surface roughness that \neither the thermal inertia is extremely low ($\\Gamma$\\,$<$\\,0.1\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$}) \\emph{or} the\nsubsolar latitude is $\\beta_{ss}$\\,$\\approx$\\,90\\degr{} (we see the spin-axis near to pole-on). \nFor a near to pole-on configuration the thermal intertia should still be low, but it can be a value \nsomewhat higher than in general case, typically $\\Gamma$\\,$\\approx$\\,2\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$}{} may be possible. \nThe other possibility, $\\beta_{ss}$\\,$\\approx$\\,90\\degr{} is not supported by the light \ncurve constraints, as a maximum value of $\\beta_{ss}$\\,$\\approx$\\,60\\degr{}\nis obtained in the spin axis analysis \n(see Sect.~\\ref{sect:spin} and Fig.~\\ref{fig:vartheta}). \n\nIf we allow for a high surface roughness \n($\\rho$\\,=\\,0.9 that can be achieved with 90\\degr{} craters at 100\\% coverage), \ndifferent sub-solar latitudes become possible. E.g. for $\\beta_{ss}$\\,=\\,0\\degr{}\n$\\eta$\\,=\\,0.76 results in a very low thermal inertia of $\\Gamma$\\,=\\,0.5\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$}.\n\\citet{Lellouch2013} found an average thermal inertia of \n$\\Gamma$\\,=\\,2.5$\\pm$0.5\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$} among Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects\nin the heliocentric distance range of 25\\,au\\,$<$\\,r$_h$\\,$<$\\,41\\,au, \nwith a strong suggestion of decreasing $\\Gamma$ with increasing heliocentric distance.\nEven higher values of $\\Gamma$ are expected among the icy moons of the outer giant\nplanets. This may indicate that the observed\nvalues of the beaming parameter may rather be explained by a higher\nsubsolar latitude ($\\beta_{ss}$\\,$\\approx$\\,60\\degr) than by a very low thermal \ninertia value of the surface. This also suggests that the shape of Nereid\nmay be elongated to some level, because high $\\beta_{ss}$ values are found\nfor larger axis ratio parameters in Sect.~\\ref{sect:spin}. \n\n\\subsection{Thermophysical modelling}\n\\label{sect:tpm}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=8cm,angle=0]{./sed_tpm_x0113.png}\n\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=8.1cm,angle=0]{./temperature_dist_tpm.png}\n\\caption{Upper panel: Best fit TPM model of the thermal emission of\nNereid for an axis ratio parameter of X\\,=\\,0.0133 and a\nspin axis orientation of $\\lambda_p$\\,=\\,320\\degr{} and \n$\\beta_p$\\,=\\,32\\degr{}.

The TPM calculates the\ntemperature distribution on the surface of a body for a specific shape,\nillumination, observing geometry, spin axis direction and rotation period. \nThe model considers the thermal properties of the surface directly, \nincluding thermal inertia and surface roughness. \n\nWe looked for solutions that matches the observed Spitzer/MIPS and \nHerschel/PACS far infrared fluxes the best, using the input fluxes\nlisted in Table~\\ref{table:fluxes}. As in the case of the NEATM model,\nwe characterise the goodness of fit by calculating the reduced\n$\\chi^2$ values and we require that acceptable solutions should\nfulfil the requirement of $\\chi^2_r$\\,$\\le$\\,$(1+\\sigma)^2$. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow ($\\rho$\\,=\\,0.1) to intermediate ($\\rho$\\,=\\,0.5) \nsurface roughness cannot explain the observed fluxes as \nthese values result in very high ($\\chi^2_r$\\,$\\gg$\\,3) reduced $\\chi^2$. \nAll acceptable solutions ($\\chi^2_r$\\,$<$\\,1.7) are related\nto \"hot model settings\", i.e., very high roughness \n($\\rho$\\,$\\ge$\\,0.7) combined with extremely low thermal inertia \n($\\Gamma$\\,$\\ll$\\,1\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$}), except for configurations near to pole-on where \nhot temperatures are reached for a wider range of thermal inertias, as in \nthese cases heat is not transported to the night side.\nAll acceptable settings ($\\chi^2_r$\\,$<$\\,1.7) produce size and\n  albedo solutions with D$_{eff}$=\\,353--362\\,km and \n  p$_V$\\,=\\,0.23--0.25. \n  \nAssuming that Nereid has a thermal inertia in the range of\n 1--5\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$}, comparable to typical TNOs/Centaurs at similar distances\n \\citep[see][]{Lellouch2013}, only model settings\n  with a spin axis direction close to \"pole-on\", \n  \\{$\\lambda_p$,$\\beta_p$\\}\\,=\\,\\{320$\\pm$30\\degr, 0$\\pm$30\\degr\\}, produce acceptable\n  flux predictions.\n  The best-fit case of these models provided an effective size of D\\,=\\,357$\\pm$13\\,km \n  and a geometric albedo of p$_V$\\,=\\,0.24$\\pm$0.02.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur TPM analysis above suggested a high subsolar latitude and a correspondingly low \nspin axis aspect angle. According to the spin-axis constraints \ndiscussed in Sect.~\\ref{sect:spin} high $\\beta_{ss}$ may occur for the highest possible \naxis ratio parameters only. This favours shape solutions of X\\,$\\approx$\\,0.13, and a \ncorresponding subsolar latitude of $\\beta_{ss}$\\,$\\approx$60\\degr{} \n(see Fig.~\\ref{fig:vartheta}). We have chosen the highest possible shape\nparameter value of X\\,=\\,0.133 (a:c\\,=\\,1.3:1) and the corresponding subsolar latitude of\n$\\beta_{ss}$\\,=\\,58\\degr{}, and tested the feasibility of this configuration in a TPM\nmodel. When high roughness ($\\rho$\\,=\\,0.9) is assumed we obtained an acceptable \n$\\chi^2_r$ value of 1.2, but this is associated with a very low thermal inertia of \n$\\Gamma$\\,=\\,0.5\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$}. For this solution the best fit effective diameter is D\\,=\\,335\\,km,\nwith a correspondig geometric albedo of p$_V$\\,=\\,0.275. Application of an extreme roughness of \n$\\rho$\\,=\\,1.0 provides very low reduced $\\chi^2$ values of $\\sim$0.5, even when the\n\"nominal\" $\\Gamma$\\,=\\,5\\,{$J\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1/2}\\,K^{-1}$} thermal inertia values are used. \nHowever, in these cases we obtain a somewhat smaller size of D\\,=\\,326\\,km \nand a higher albedo of p$_V$\\,=\\,0.29. \n \n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sect:Discussion}\n\nThe most important question about Nereid, as discussed in the literature,\nwas its shape and the precession behaviour of its spin axis. \nThis was modelled in detail by \n\\citet{Schaefer2008} and \\citet{Hesselbrock2013}, with the main aim \nto explain the large amplitude brightness variations seen on different time\nscales. These models assumed a long rotation period (72--144\\,h) \nwhich was needed to achieve precession timescales of around a decade. \n\nOne important finding of our paper is that we confirmed the short (11\\fh594)\nrotation period observed earlier by \\citet{Grav2003} and \\citet{Terai}. \nAs it has been mentioned previously, a short rotation period \nimplies a long spin axis precession time, as \nP$_{prec}$\\,$\\propto$\\,P$_{orb}^2$/P$_{spin}$, where \nP$_{prec}$ is the precession period, P$_{orb}$ is the orbital \nperiod around Neptune, and P$_{spin}$ is the rotation period\n\\citep[see e.g.][]{Hesselbrock2013}. P$_{prec}$ values calculated from the \n11\\fh594 rotation period are at least an order of \nmagnitude longer than those assumed by \\citet{Schaefer2008} \nand \\citet{Hesselbrock2013}, even if an extremely elongated body is assumed. \nTherefore the spin axis orientation could not change significantly\nin the last $\\sim$15 years, and the precession of the spin axis cannot be \nthe reason behind the large flux variations observed. \n\nIn Sect.~\\ref{sect:spin} we used this stability of the\nspin axis orientation and obtained a maximum \naxis ratio of a:c\\,=\\,1.3 from the light curve amplitude analysis.\nAccording to \\citet{Hesselbrock2013}, forced precession \nof Nereid could be feasible only if the moon is considerably \nelongated with an $a$:$c$ axis ratio of $\\sim$1.9:1. Such a high\naxis ratio is excluded by our results, consistently with the long precession\ntimescales obtained. \n\nThe shape solution favoured by the thermal analysis \n(axis ratio parameter of X\\,=\\,0.133) is also the one that \nprovides the maximum possible light curve amplitude of $\\Delta m$\\,$\\approx$\\,0\\fm13, \nwith a peak in the 1960's (see Sect.~\\ref{sect:spin}). \nEven this solution is unable to explain the extremely large brightness\nvariations observed some decades ago \n\\citep[up to $\\Delta m$ of 0\\fm5, see fig.~4 in ][for a summary of these data]{Schaefer2008}. \nWhatever caused these variations, it cannot be the forced precession of a very \nelongated Nereid, as this scenario is inconsistent with our present data. \n\nThe long rotation period assumed by \\citet{Schaefer2008} and \n\\citet{Hesselbrock2013} was partly based on the expectation\nthat if Nereid was formed around Neptune or captured at early times, then \nits original rotation -- which could have had a period of a few hours -- \nshould have slowed down considerably, even if Nereid is just slightly elongated.\n\n\n\nIn this sense, Nereid rotates fast today -- this may favour a late \ncapture (i.e. Nereid did not have enough time to slow down considerably) \nor indicate some other influence, like a collision, that may overwrite the \nrotational state. We note that \\citet{Grav2004} suggested that Halimede, a small \nmoon of Neptune, may be a fragment of Nereid broken off during a collision.  \nThis scenario for the origin of Halimede is supported by their \nsimilar colours and the relatively high probability of a collision between Nereid and \nHalimede in the timespan between the formation of the Solar System and today \n\\citep{Holman2004}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in detail in \\citet{Schaefer2008}, the Voyager-2 images\nanalysed by \\citet{Thomas1991} could hardly be used to put constraints \non the actual shape of Nereid, i.e. we did not have enough information \nto tell whether Nereid was spherical or notably non-spherical. \nThe combination of the spin axis constrains and both the NEATM and TPM radiometry \nresults favors a moderately elongated shape with a axis ratio parameter X\\,$\\approx$\\,0.13, \nand correspondingly a present subsolar latitude of $\\beta_{ss}$\\,$\\approx$\\,60\\degr\n(a possible shape solution using X\\,=\\,0.133 is presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:tpmres}b). \nThe moderately elongated shape put forward here for Nereid is feasible regarding \nobservational constraints. However, for a moon of \n$\\sim$350\\,km in diameter a shape closer to spherical may be more likely\n\\citep[see e.g.][]{Schaefer2008} based on the shape information of giant \nplanet moons of similar size. Most of these large ($>$100\\,km in radius) moons are round \nto a few per cent (better than 10\\%) accuracy. Our preferred solution for Nereid is \nfurther away from a perfect sphere. One exception among these satellites may be the \nSaturn moon, Hyperion, which is highly elongated despite that it is similar in \nsize to Nereid (about 205$\\times$130$\\times$110\\,km semi-axes). \nIn the case of Hyperion the\nelongated shape is explained by the high porosity of the interior ($\\sim$40\\%) \nthat also leads to a 'sponge-like', high roughness surface \nwhere craters remain nearly unchanged over billions of years \\citep{hyperion}. \nA porous internal structure and high roughness surface similar to that of \nHyperion may explain well both the elongated shape and the radiometry analysis \nresults obtained for Nereid in the present paper. \n\nIn a recent paper \\citet{Lacerda2014} presented an analysis \nof colours and albedos of Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects, \nand identified two main groups whose existence can be considered\nas an evidence for a compositional discontinuity in the young Solar System.\nFor comparison, we plotted the colour and albedo of Nereid in a diagram \n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:albedocolour}) similar to fig.~2 in \\citet{Lacerda2014},\npresenting these dark-neutral and bright-red objects. Colours\nare represented by spectral slopes, calculated in the same way as in \n\\citet{Lacerda2014}. \nIf Nereid was either formed around Neptune or captured during Neptun's outward\nmigration from the 20-30\\,au distance range in the early Solar System, \nit is expected to exhibit a surface similar to the objects \nin the dark-neutral group. Indeed, Nereid is close in colour to the \ntypical colours of objects in this group, but at the same time, \nits albedo is significantly larger than the typical value in this group, \neven larger than the albedos of most objects in the bright-red group. \nIf Nereid was a member to the dark-neutral group, it would have the \nbrightest surface among these objects. While Nereid is at the edge of the \ndistributions of objects of both major groups in the albedo-colour plain, it \nis rather close in these characteristics to the Saturnian moon Hyperion\n(purple triangle in Fig.~\\ref{fig:albedocolour}). As mentioned earlier,\nthe surface roughness and internal structure of Nereid may as well be \nsimilar to those characteristic of this irregular satellite.  \n  \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=8cm,angle=0]{./albedoslope2.png}\n\\caption[]{Albedo-colour diagram of Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects, \nalso presenting the colours and albedos of Nereid \n\\citep[brown triangle, data from this paper and][]{Grav2004} \nand Hyperion \\citep[purple triangle,][]{Hicks2008,Thomas2010}. \nThe colours and albedos of the other objects are taken from the original \nresources cited in \\citet{Lacerda2014}. The colours of the symbols are\nthe same as in \\citet{Lacerda2014}: red dots -- bright-red group, \nblue dots -- dark-neutral group, orange dots -- Haumea-type objects,\ngreen-dots -- largest TNOs, {\\bf black-dots -- objects with large \nuncertainties and ambiguous surface type}.}\n\\label{fig:albedocolour}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\\section{Summary}\n\\label{sect:summary}\n\nIn this paper we presented space born observation of Nereid, performed by the Kepler \nSpace Telescope in the framework of the extended K2 mission, and results obtained \nfrom archival infrared data of the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space \nObservatory. From the Kepler K2 data we obtained a light curve that was the same in \nperiod and similar in amplitude to those\nobtained from ground based observations in 2001 and 2008. \nThese observations together contrain the possible rotation states of Nereid very well. \nAccording to these results, Nereid is in a low amplitude apparent light curve state \nnowadays, but may have \nbeen in a much larger amplitude state some decades ago. We managed to exclude very \nelongated shapes with axis ratios above $1.3$:$1$; this also means that Nereid cannot be \nin a forced precession state due to tidal forces as it is not elongated enough for this \nprocess. This is a robust result as we assumed that the light curve of Nereid is solely \ncaused by shape effects and albedo variegations existing on the surfce would just make \nthe moon more spherical in this respect. \n\nWe confirmed the size of Nereid obtained from Voyager-2 flyby data by an independent \nmethod -- radiometry based on infrared data. Both the NEATM and TPM thermal emission \nmodels resulted in similar effective size (D\\,=335--345\\,km) and albedo values \n(p$_V$\\,=\\,0.25--0.27). Both methods indicate\nvery high roughness (likely $\\rho$\\,$\\approx$\\,0.9) independently of shape, \ni.e. a surface with deep craters and very high surface coverage. \nUsing the light curve and thermal emission results together\nwe obtain a likely moderately elongated shape (a:c\\,$\\approx$1.3:1) and a present \nspin axis aspect angle of $\\vartheta$\\,$\\approx$\\,30\\degr{} for this irregular \nmoon of Neptune. This shape may partly explain the larger light curves amplitudes \nobserved some decades ago. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace*{2mm}\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\n\nThis project has been supported by the Lend\\\"ulet-2009 and \nLP2012-31 Young Researchers Program of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, \nthe Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office\ngrants OTKA K-109276 and K-104607, NKFIH K-115709 and PD-116175, \nand by City of Szombathely under agreement no.
