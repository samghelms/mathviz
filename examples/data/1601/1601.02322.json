in understanding of the $\\bar K N$ interactions \nat low energies.\nHowever, of course $\\Lambda$(1405) is not the only hyperon resonance with strangeness\n$S=-1$ ($Y^*$), but actually a lot of $Y^*$ resonances \nare listed by PDG~\\cite{pdg2014}.\nIn despite of its multitude of reported $Y^*$ resonances, most of them are much \nless understood than the nonstrangeness $N^*$ and $\\Delta^*$ resonances. \nFor example, even low-lying resonances are not well determined for $Y^*$.\nIn fact, most of the low-lying $\\Sigma^*$ resonances with mass \nless than $\\sim$ 1.7 GeV are poorly established, and even the spin-parity is not assigned \nfor some of those resonances~(see page 1456 of Ref.~\\cite{pdg2014}).\nIn addition, a possible existence of $J^P=1/2^-$ $\\Lambda$ resonance \nwith mass less than 1.4 GeV has been suggested (see, e.g., Ref.~\\cite{ihjksy11}),\nbut its existence is still controversial.\nAnother example is that only the resonance parameters given by the\nBreit-Wigner parametrization had been listed by PDG before 2012~\\cite{pdg2012},\nexcept for $\\Sigma(1385)$ and $\\Lambda(1520)$.\nThis is in contrast to the $N^*$ and $\\Delta^*$ cases, where \nthe resonances defined by poles of scattering amplitudes \nhave also been extensively studied, and \nthe resonance parameters extracted with both the pole definitions and \nthe Breit-Wigner parametrizations are listed by PDG.\n\n\nRecently, we have developed a dynamical coupled-channels (DCC) model for\n$K^-p$ reactions \\cite{kbp1,kbp2}, aiming at \n(a) extracting the $Y^*$ resonance parameters defined by poles of scattering amplitudes, \n(b) exploring the role of reaction dynamics in understanding of\nthe structure and dynamical origin etc. of $Y^*$ resonances, and \n(c) providing the elementary $\\bar K N$ reaction amplitudes that \ncan be used, e.g., for studying\nthe productions of hypernuclei and kaonic nuclei.\nOur DCC model is based on multichannel scattering equations obeyed by \nthe partial-wave amplitudes for $a \\to b$ reactions:\n \n \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nT_{b,a} (p_b,p_a;W) = \nV_{b,a} (p_b,p_a;W)\n+\\sum_c \\int q^2dq

Reactions}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.7\\textwidth]{l-mass.eps}\n\\\\\n\\vspace*{0.5em}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.7\\textwidth]{s-mass.eps}\n\\caption{\n\\label{spectrum}\nExtracted

GeV \nand $0 \\leq -{\\rm Im}(M_R) \\leq 0.2$ GeV, are presented. \nThe results are from Model A (red) and Model B (blue) of our DCC analysis~\\cite{kbp1,kbp2}, \nand from the KSU analysis~\\cite{zhang2013} (green).\nThe Breit-Wigner masses and widths of the four- and three-star resonances rated \nby PDG~\\cite{pdg2014} (black) are also presented for a reference.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{spectrum} shows the comparison of $Y^*$ mass spectra extracted through \ncomprehensive analyses of $K^- p$ reactions.\nHere, the two spectra shown in red and blue are extracted from the two solutions\nof our DCC analysis, named Model A and Model B, respectively~\\cite{kbp1,kbp2}.\nThe appearance of the two solutions is because the available $K^-p$ reaction data \nare not sufficient to constrain our model parameters uniquely but it allowed us \nto have two distinct sets of our model parameters, yet both gives almost \nthe same $\\chi^2$ values.\nThe results from our two models and the one extracted by the KSU analysis~\\cite{zhang2013}\nagree very well for several resonances that are enclosed by orange dotted line\nin Fig.~\\ref{spectrum}.\nHowever, in overall, the extracted results are still fluctuating\nbetween our two models and the KSU analysis.\nAgain, this is because the existing $K^-p$ reaction data are not sufficient \nto constrain the analysis, \nand without new data this level of analysis dependence in the spectrum will not be avoidable.\n\n\nIt is interesting to see in Fig.~\\ref{spectrum} that \nModel B has a very narrow $J^P=3/2^+$ $\\Lambda$ resonance that is completely new.\nThe pole mass of this resonance is $M_R = 1671^{+2}_{-8}-i(5^{+11}_{-2})$ MeV, and \nit is located just above the $\\eta \\Lambda$ threshold.\nAlthough at present this resonance is only seen in Model B, \nwe have found in Refs.~\\cite{kbp1,kbp2} that \nthis new $J^P=3/2^+$ $\\Lambda$ resonance is responsible for the reproduction of\nthe concave-up angular dependence of the $K^- p \\to \\eta \\Lambda$ differential cross sections\nnear the threshold, and thus the existence of this resonance seems to be favored \nby the experimental data.\nIn fact, Model A does not reproduce the angular dependence of the \n$K^- p \\to \\eta \\Lambda$ differential cross section data so well as compared to Model B, \nand those data were not included in the KSU analysis~\\cite{zhang2013}.\nFor further confirmation, however,\none needs more extensive and accurate data for $K^- p \\to \\eta \\Lambda $ reactions\nnear the threshold, including the recoil polarization $P$ and hopefully the spin-rotation \nangle $\\beta$.\n\n\nAnother interesting thing is that a number of low-lying $\\Sigma$ resonances located just above\nthe $\\bar KN$ threshold are found \n(the resonances enclosed by purple dotted line in Fig.~\\ref{spectrum}).\nTheir existence is still analysis dependent, but they may correspond to the one-star and \ntwo-star resonances listed by PDG~\\cite{pdg2014}.\nAgain, much more data are definitely needed to establish these low-lying resonances. \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.75\\textwidth]{s01-pole.eps}\n\\caption{\n\\label{s01}\n``Predicted'' values of poles of $J^P= 1/2^-$ $\\Lambda$ resonances located in the $\\bar K N$\nsubthreshold region~\\cite{kbp2}.\nThe result in the left (right) panel is from Model A (Model B)~\\cite{kbp2}.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nFinally, we present the $J^P =1/2^-$ $\\Lambda$ resonances lying below the $\\bar K N$ threshold,\nwhich are found from our two models (Fig.~\\ref{s01}). \nHere we note that our current models were constructed by fitting only the $K^-p$ reactions, \nand thus the $\\bar K N$ subthreshold region is out of the scope of our current analysis.\nThe extracted results should therefore be regarded as ``predictions'' from our current models\nand are subject to change once our analysis is extended to the $\\bar K N$ subthreshold region.\nWe see from Fig.~\\ref{s01} that both models have two resonance poles, \nwhere the higher mass poles (A1 and B1) should correspond to $\\Lambda(1405)$.\nOn the other hand, the existence of another resonance state (A2 and B2) with mass lower than\n$\\Lambda(1405)$ seems consistent with the one obtained in the so-called chiral unitary models\n(see, e.g., Ref.~\\cite{ihjksy11}).\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Summary and Future Works}\n\n\nWe have presented highlighted results for the $Y^*$ resonance mass spectrum\nextracted via our DCC analysis of the data for the\n$K^- p \\to \\bar K N, \\pi \\Sigma, \\pi\\Lambda, \\eta \\Lambda, K\\Xi$ reactions \nover the wide energy range from the thresholds up to $W=2.1$ GeV.\nThe results suggest possible existences of the new narrow $J^P=3/2^+$ $\\Lambda$ resonance\nand unestablished low-lying $\\Sigma^*$ resonances, and give ``predictions'' for \n$J^P=1/2^-$ $\\Lambda$ resonances located below the $\\bar K N$ threshold.\nIt should be emphasized that this kind of comprehensive analysis to extract $Y^*$ \nresonance parameters defined by poles of scattering amplitudes is for the first time \nwithin the dynamical-model approaches.\nHowever, a visible analysis dependence is found to still exist for the extracted results, \nand this is because the current database of $K^- p$ reactions is far from complete.\nWe hope that the hadron beam facilities such as J-PARC measure these very fundamental \nreactions that are necessary for establishing $Y^*$ resonances.\n\n\nTo extend our analysis to the $\\bar K N$ subthreshold region, we are now developing a model for\nthe $K^- d \\to \\pi Y N$ reactions, which are being measured by the J-PARC E31 \nexperiment~\\cite{noumi}.\nA strong point of our model is that it can properly take account of the higher partial-wave\ncontributions for the elementary processes, which is in contrast to most of the previous\nstudies where only the $S$-wave contribution is included.\nThe result of our extended analysis will be presented elsewhere.\n\n\nAlthough it was not discussed in this contribution, our models can provide \nboth on- and off-shell amplitudes for $MB \\to M'B'$ reactions \nwith $MB,M'B' = \\bar K N, \\pi \\Sigma, \\pi \\Lambda, \\eta \\Lambda, K\\Xi, \n\\pi\\Sigma^*, \\bar K^* N$~\\cite{kbp1}.\nThese elementary amplitudes can be an important input to \nthe hypernuclei and kaonic-nuclei production reactions.\nWe hope to make applications of our approach to such nuclear-target reactions.\n\\\\\n\nThe author thanks T.-S.~H.~Lee, S.~X.~Nakamura, and T.~Sato for their collaborations.\nThis work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. 25800149 and by\nthe
