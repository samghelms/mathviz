The nature of the\nreconstructions generated by the method differs fundamentally from\nthose generated via standard Tikhonov regularisation in terms of the\nlevel of sparsity in the distribution of charge strengths specifying the basis. In many cases, \nthe $\\ell_1$ optimisation leads to a solution basis whose size is\nonly a small fraction of the total number of measured data points.\nThe effects of changing the wavenumber, the internal source surface\nand the (noisy) acoustic pressure data in general will all be\nstudied with reference to a numerical study on a cuboid of similar\ndimensions to a typical loudspeaker cabinet. The development of\nsparse and accurate reconstructions has a number of advantageous\nconsequences including improved reconstructions from reduced data\nsets, the enhancement of numerical solution methods and wider\napplications in source identification problems.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nNear-field acoustic holography (NAH) was first documented in $1980$\n\\cite{EW80a,EW80b} as a method for reconstructing acoustic radiation\nfrom vibrating structures based on acoustic pressures measured in a\nhologram plane. This was originally carried out using Fourier\nacoustics and so was only suitable for geometries corresponding to\nthe separable geometries of the acoustic wave equation such as an\ninfinite plane, an infinite cylinder or a sphere in a free field.\nRecent progress \\cite{GC12} has seen ideas from signal processing\nand imaging, and in particular the much celebrated compressive\nsampling (or compressed sensing) \\cite{EC08}, adopted to reduce\nmeasurement requirements and reconstruct acoustic fields above the\nNyquist frequency. In this paper we develop a method based on an\ninverse formulation of the superposition method proposed by Koopman\n\\emph{et al.} \\cite{GK89} that can reconstruct acoustic fields from\narbitrary shaped radiating objects and make use of sparse\nreconstruction principles as proposed in Ref. \\cite{GC12}.\n\nNear-field acoustic holography for arbitrary geometries was first\nperformed using the inverse boundary element method (IBEM)\n\\cite{BG88}. A large number of publications on IBEM have since\nemerged, and more recently with the IBEM combined in hybrid methods\nwhich employ expansions of particular solutions of the Helmholtz\nequation to enrich the measured pressure data \\cite{SW02,SW04}. One\ndrawback of the IBEM is that it suffers from the same irregular\nfrequency problem (at the resonances of the associated interior\ndomain) as the forward boundary element method (BEM) \\cite{DC09}.\nWhilst this problem can be treated using the same methods as for the\nforward problem (for example, using the Burton and Miller method\n\\cite{AB71} as in Ref. \\cite{DC09}, or the so-called combined\nHelmholtz integral equation formulation (CHIEF) \\cite{HS68}), such\nmethods complicate the implementation and reduce the computational\nefficiency to some degree.\n\nIn addition to the irregular frequency problem, boundary element\napproaches also require very fine meshes to accurately represent\nsolutions at high frequencies, and to give good representations of\nthe acoustic field in the immediate vicinity of the radiating\nobject. A number of methods have been suggested to resolve the\nshortcomings of IBEM in a manner that is both computationally\nefficient and relatively straightforward to implement. These methods\neffectively fit the measured pressure data to a linear combination\nof basis functions, and then use the coefficients determined through\nthis approximation to determine the normal velocity of the vibrating\nobject. The most well-known of these methods with respect to NAH are\nthe Helmholtz equation least squares (HELS) method proposed by Sean\nWu and co-workers \\cite{ZW97,SW00} and the method of superposition,\nwhich was applied to NAH in Refs. \\cite{AS05,NV06}, including a\ncomparison against boundary element approaches in the latter case.\nFor HELS, the basis functions are chosen as particular solutions to\nthe Helmholtz equation on an idealised domain, typically a sphere.\nIn the case of the superposition method then it is the free space\nGreen's functions that are employed for the basis.\n\nIt is shown in Ref. \\cite{GK89} that the superposition method for an\nexterior acoustic problem is equivalent to the Helmholtz integral\nequation. This is one reason for favoring the superposition approach\nto HELS, where the chosen basis is typically only complete outside\nthe minimum sphere enclosing the radiating object \\cite{SW00}. This\nwould be a drawback for approximating radiation from objects that\nare far from spherical in the region inside this minimum sphere.\nKoopman \\emph{et al.} \\cite{GK89} also argue that the superposition\nmethod will not suffer from the same irregular frequency problem as\nthe boundary element method since the set of source points chosen\nfor the superposition (after truncating the superposition integral\nto a finite sum) will not form a unique boundary surface inside the\ninterior volume. However, the computations in Ref. \\cite{GK89} were\nonly performed with small numbers of source points, and irregular\nfrequency problems may arise should the source points more closely\nrepresent an interior boundary surface \\cite{WB97,AL10}.\n\nOne of the main challenges involved in the superposition method is\nobtaining an optimal choice of source (or charge) points over which\nto compute the superposition. In particular, research on (forward)\ninterior Helmholtz problems \\cite{AB08} suggests that the source\npoints should be chosen close to the radiating surface so that no\nsingularities of the analytically continued solution lie between the\ncharge points and the radiating surface. However, for the exterior\nproblem, Koopman \\emph{et al.} \\cite{GK89} report that choosing the\ncharge points too close to the radiating surface degrades the\naccuracy of the method, whilst choosing charge points too far from\nthe surface leads to very poor conditioning. Applying the\nsuperposition method together with a nonlinear optimisation\nalgorithm to optimise the accuracy of the solution over both the\ncharge point strengths and locations is known as the method of\nfundamental solutions, see for example Refs. \\cite{GF98,GF03}. We\nwill show that in combination with sparse optimisation methods, a\nrelatively small number of charge points can be chosen to accurately\nreconstruct the surface velocity, particularly in the sub-Nyquist\nfrequency regime.\n\nRegularisation schemes for NAH are typically based on standard\nTikhonov methods, an excellent overview is presented in Ref.\n\\cite{EW01}. The most favorable method for selecting the\nregularisation parameter in NAH applications is reported as a\nmodified generalised cross validation (GCV) method, although many\nother possibilities are discussed in Ref. \\cite{EW01}. Recent work\n\\cite{GC12} has suggested the possibility of using $\\ell_1$\noptimisation algorithms to instead in cases when a suitable\ndictionary of basis functions can be defined. Whilst this leads to a\nloss of efficiency in the optimisation process, it also promotes\nsparsity of the solution, and the convexity of the $\\ell_1$ norm\nmeans that convex optimisation toolboxes such as SPGL1 \\cite{EB15}\nor CVX \\cite{MG15} can be applied. Chardon \\emph{et al.} \\cite{GC12}\ncombine sparse optimisation techniques with a Fourier basis / plane\nwave approximation of the solution on flat star-like plates and\nreport accurate reconstructions with sparse basis expansions. In\ncombination with randomised measurement data, these methods gave\nfaithful reconstructions, even above the Nyquist frequency. More\nrecently, sparse $\\ell_1$ optimisation with a plane wave basis has\nbeen proposed as a means of source identification from spherical\nacoustic radiators \\cite{AX15a}.\n\nIn this paper we discuss the possibility of a sparse solution\nrepresentation using $\\ell_1$ optimisation techniques based on the\nsuperposition method for application to general three dimensional\nproblems. A study of this combination of methods for reconstructing\nvibration of flat plates has recently been presented in Ref.\n\\cite{AX15b}. The method of superposition appears to be the most\npromising approach since there are close links between plane wave\nmethod and the method of superposition for bounded domains as\ndescribed in Ref. \\cite{CA05}. In addition, the superposition method\nis typically accurate for frequencies above the six degrees of\nfreedom per wavelength rule of thumb for boundary element methods\n\\cite{AB08} and can handle internal resonance frequencies in a\nrelatively simple manner \\cite{WB97,AL10}. The application and\nsuitability of these methods will also be considered for the\nreconstruction of the Neumann boundary data on a cuboid of similar\ndimensions to a typical loudspeaker cabinet over a range of\nfrequencies.\n\nInitially we will study test problems where the exterior acoustic\nfield is generated by a monopole point source inside the structure.\nIn this case the solution could be represented exactly for\narbitrarily high frequencies using the method of superposition if\none of the points on the surface of interior charge points coincides\nwith the monopole generating the acoustic field. However, in general\nsuch information would not be known \\emph{a-priori} when sampling an\nacoustic field in NAH. We will therefore examine the dependence of\nthe reconstruction on the locations of the charge points and the\nmonopole generating the acoustic field. Finally, we will consider a\ncase where the acoustic field is not generated by an interior\nmonopole, but rather by a relatively small vibrating patch on an\notherwise rigid structure. This leads to a problem where the method\nof superposition should return a sparse expansion for interior\ncharge point surfaces very close to the physical boundary, since the\nweighting of sources close to the vibrating region will be dominant\ncompared to those close to the rigid part of the structure. The\nlatter (locally radiating) case also has parallels with the\nsituation that arises when modelling acoustic radiation from\nloudspeakers.\n\n\\section{Method of Superposition for Near-field Acoustic Holography}\n\nLet $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ be a finite domain with boundary\nsurface $\\Gamma$.

First we look at the case\nwhen the frequency is increased, including when the Nyquist\nfrequency is exceeded. Since our measurements are taken at triangle\ncentroids then the resulting measurement grid is irregular and so\nthe Nyquist frequency is not well-defined. We therefore choose the\nNyquist frequency associated with the regular grid given by the\ntriangle vertices, as a value approximately representative of the\nNyquist frequency. For the discretisation considered in the previous\nsection with $576$ triangles, the grid spacing is $\\Delta x =\n0.04667$, meaning that the wavenumber corresponding to the Nyquist\nfrequency is $k_{\\mathrm{nyq}}=\\pi/\\Delta x= 67.32$. We also\ninvestigate the performance of the method close to other typical\nthreshold frequencies for numerical solution approaches, such as the\nsix grid points per wavelength rule of thumb for finite and boundary\nelement methods, which gives a maximum wavenumber of $k=22.44$ for\nthe grid described above. The performance of the method at irregular\nfrequencies will also be investigated. For the method of\nsuperposition these irregular frequencies are the resonances of the\nregion enclosed by the interior source surface \\cite{GK89}.\nNumerical studies indicate that one such frequency is close to\n$k^*=17.54/\\alpha$, which here is $k=52.62$.\n\nTable \\ref{T2} gives the reconstruction error for a range of\nwavenumbers $k$ using $\\ell_1$ reconstruction techniques and\ncompares the accuracy of the reconstruction using all 576 charge\npoints, and using two different values of the sparsity parameter\n$\\beta$. In particular, we compare the default choice used in the\nlast section of $\\beta=0.5$ with the choice $\\beta=0.9$, which uses\nfewer charge points but at the potential cost of poorer accuracy.\nThe maximum wavenumber studied corresponds to the wavelength being\nclose to (but still greater than) the exterior measurement distance\n$\\delta$. The results show that both irregular and high frequencies\nlead to a degradation in the accuracy of the reconstruction, and\nlead to a loss of sparsity in the reconstructions. Accurate and\nreasonably sparse reconstructions can be generated provided there\nare at least 3 data points per wavelength since for up to $k=44.88$\nwe can reconstruct the solution with a smaller error than the level\nof added noise ($15\\%$) and with at least an order of magnitude\nreduction from the total number of charge points (576). These\nresults are consistent with the findings of Ref. \\cite{AB08}, where\nit is also suggested that a superposition method will give accurate\nresults provided there are at least 3 degrees of freedom per\nwavelength. We note that if the surface of interior charge points\nincludes the monopole generating the acoustic field then one would\nobtain exact representations for arbitrarily high frequencies.\n\nIn addition to the general trend of increased errors for higher\nfrequencies, one also observes a local peak in the error at the\ncharacteristic wavenumber $k=52.62$. Here we see that the error is\nparticularly poor for the sparse reconstruction with $\\beta=0.9$,\nand that there is also a local peak in the number of dominant charge\npoints. This suggests that sparse reconstructions are not feasible\nat higher frequencies or at irregular frequencies. However, the\nreconstruction error is lower than the noise level for the schemes\nusing all charge points or with $\\beta=0.5$ for all frequencies\ntested up to twice the Nyquist frequency. The results of this\nsection therefore suggest that the method of superposition with\n$\\ell_1$ regularisation can provide excellent reconstructions for\nfrequencies up to around twice the Nyquist frequency, and that\nsparse reconstructions are feasible provided we have at least three\ndata points per wavelength. Irregular frequencies degrade both\naccuracy and sparsity. However, if a more accurate and sparsely\nreconstructed solution was required at $k=52.62$, then we could\nchange the scaling of the internal source surface (i.e. change\n$\\alpha$) which would move the location of the irregular frequency.\nChanging $\\alpha$ from $1/3$ to $0.4$ leads to a percentage error of\n\\textsc{6.131\\%} for both the full reconstruction and the sparse\nscheme with $\\beta=0.5$, which identifies $N^*(0.5)=102$ dominant\ncharge points. For $\\beta=0.9$, the error increases to\n$\\textsc{16.00\\%}$ with $N^*(0.9)=63$. Note that these results are\nfar more consistent with the other results shown in Table \\ref{T2}\nand the removal of the local error peaks is shown more clearly in\nFig. \\ref{kchange}, where the diamond symbols show the values\ncomputed with $\\alpha=0.4$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n          \\epsfig{file=kchange, width=\\textwidth}\n        \\caption{\\label{kchange} The accuracy and sparsity of the reconstructed solutions with $15\\%$ added noise, $\\alpha=1/3$ and $z_{0}=0.05$. The plots show the effect of changing the wavenumber $k$, including the effect of irregular frequencies and values above the Nyquist frequency.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe results presented by Chardon \\emph{et. al.} \\cite{GC12} using\nsparse plane wave reconstructions indicate that randomising the\nexterior data point locations (measurement locations) within the\nhologram plane facilitates sparse reconstructions above the Nyquist\nlimit. Unfortunately, the reconstructed solutions using the method\nof superposition lose their sparsity at frequencies around and above\nthe Nyquist limit and randomising the data point locations has been\nobserved to degrade the accuracy of the reconstructed solution in\ngeneral across the range of wavenumbers studied in Fig.\n\\ref{kchange}. These observations are consistent with the findings\nin Ref. \\cite{MB10}. \\emph{The main result of this section is that\nalthough in certain special cases  $\\ell_1$ sparse regularisation\ncould give exact representations up to arbitrarily high frequencies,\nin general the reconstruction accuracy will decrease at higher\nfrequencies. Irregular frequencies can also be treated simply by\nperturbing the surface of interior charge points.}\n\n\n\\subsection{Dependance on the singularity and charge point locations}\n\nThe results in the previous sections all reconstructed the Neumann\ndata generated from a point source located on the $z-$axis at\n$z_{0}=0.05$. This ensured that the singularity in the solution of\nthe related interior problem was located within the interior charge\npoint surface for $\\alpha=1/3$. We now consider how the accuracy and\nsparsity of our reconstructed solutions depends on both the position\nof an interior source point generating the exterior pressure data,\nand the relative size/ position of the internal charge point surface\ncontrolled by the parameter $\\alpha$ as described in Eq.\n(\\ref{alpha}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n          \\epsfig{file=zchange, width=\\textwidth}\n        \\caption{\\label{zchange} The accuracy and sparsity of the reconstructed solutions with $k=1$ and $15\\%$ added noise. The plots show the effect of using a range of different sized interior charge point surfaces and different positions for the source point generating the boundary data.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig. \\ref{zchange} shows both the percentage errors for the sparse\nreconstructions and the value of the sparsity parameter $N^*(0.5)$\nfor different sized interior charge point surfaces and for different\npositions of the point source generating the exterior data. These\nquantities have been computed for values of $\\alpha$ between $0.1$\nand $0.8$, and for $z_{0}$ between $z_{0}=0$ and $z_{0}=0.15$.\nInstead of showing values of the parameter $\\alpha$, Fig.\n\\ref{zchange} shows the corresponding $z-$coordinate where the\ninterior charge point surface intersects the positive $z-$axis. In\nthis way we are able to indicate the size of the interior charge\npoint surface relative to the location of $z_{0}$ on the same axes.\nNote that since $\\Gamma$ intersects the positive $z$-axis at\n$z=0.21$ (it is centred at the origin with total height $0.42$m),\nthen the internal source surface with, for example, $\\alpha=0.5$\nwill intersect the positive $z$-axis at $z=0.105$, and this is the\nvalue used along the horizontal axis in Fig. \\ref{zchange}. In all\ncases the added noise level is $15\\%$. Note that the relative errors\nobtained when reconstructing the solution using all charge points\ndiffers from that given by the sparse reconstruction by less than\n$1\\%$.\n\n\nEach subplot of Fig. \\ref{zchange} shows four curves, corresponding\nto each of four choices of $z_{0}$, and four vertical lines\nindicating the positions of the corresponding point $z_{0}$. The\nleft subplot shows the percentage errors for different choices of\ninterior source surface. We notice that the errors are minimised\nwhen the size of the interior source surface is such that it\nintersects the positive $z-$axis close to $z=z_{0}$, where the curve\ncrosses its corresponding vertical line. Likewise, this right\nsubplot shows that the number of charge points $N^*$ needed to\nobtain a sparse reconstruction is also minimal when the size of the\ninterior source surface is such that it intersects the positive\n$z-$axis close to $z=z_{0}$. In general, the solutions are\nreasonably accurate for source surfaces intersecting the positive\n$z-$axis between $z=0.05$ and $z=0.1$, corresponding to choosing\n$\\alpha=0.3$ or $\\alpha=0.4$. Choosing $\\alpha=0.8$ so that the\nsource surface intersects the positive $z-$axis at $z=0.168$ gave\nthe worst results in general. Interestingly, the results of this\nsection suggest that it doesn't seem to be critical whether or not\nthe surface of interior charge points encloses any singularities in\nthe modelled wave field. Furthermore, the results also point to\nimportant potential applications of the sparse superposition method\ndeveloped in this work for source identification problems in\ngeneral.\n\n\\emph{The main result of this section is that both the accuracy and\nsparsity of the reconstructed solution is enhanced when the surface\nof interior charge points includes points close to the location of\nthe interior monopole generating the acoustic field. A major\nstrength of the sparse reconstruction approach described here will\ntherefore be in its application to source identification problems.}\n\n\\subsection{Example of a locally radiating structure}\n\nIn this section we consider the problem of reconstructing the\nvibrations of a structure which is rigid, except over a relatively\nsmall region. This is both a typical assumption for applications to\nloudspeakers, and is also typical of problems commonly modelled\nusing the method of patch NAH, whereby measurements and\nreconstructions only take place in the vicinity of the vibrating\nregion (see for example Refs. \\cite{AS05,EW03}). In the present\nstudy we use such an example for verification of the sparse\nsuperposition method for a problem where the pressure data is not\ngenerated by a monopole point source, and hence an optimal choice\nfor the surface of internal charge points would not be related to\nthe location of such a monopole.\n\nWe consider reconstructing Neumann boundary data given by a raised\ncosine function\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 28473, "prevtext": "\n\nThe pressure data are specified at a distance $\\delta=0.035$m from\n$\\Gamma$ and the internal source surface is scaled down to have\ndimensions $\\alpha=1/3$ the size of $\\Gamma$. We note that these\nchoices should lead to good results based on the fact that $\\delta$\nshould be chosen small enough to capture evanescent contributions to\nthe pressure field, but still large enough to be a practical\ndistance for taking experimental measurements. For a further\ndiscussion on the role of evanescent wave contributions in\nsuperposition methods for NAH problems, the interested reader is\nreferred to Sect. 5 of Ref. \\cite{NV06}. For the choice of the\nparameter $\\alpha$ (\\ref{alpha}), Koopman \\emph{et al.} \\cite{GK89}\nsuggest that too small a value will lead to severe ill conditioning\nas the charge points become very close together, but choosing too\nlarge a value of $\\alpha$ will also give poor results. A choice in\nthe range $\\alpha\\in(0.1,0.6)$ is advised in Ref. \\cite{GK89}. It is\nalso beneficial for the charge point surface to enclose any\nsingularities of the associated interior problem \\cite{AB08}. For\nthese experiments the number of charge points, the number of\nmeasurement points and the number of points at which we reconstruct\nthe solution are all equal to 576. This is achieved by triangulating\nthe internal source surface in an identical way to $\\Gamma$ and\ntaking the charge points at the triangle centroids.\n\nThe results in Table \\ref{T1} show that in the noise free case, the\nreconstruction errors for both the full $\\ell_1$ method and Tikhonov\nregularisation are very small with Tikhonov reconstruction\nperforming better. A sparse representation of the solution is not\nfeasible here in general unless one of the charge points coincides\nwith the monopole generating the acoustic field; the $\\ell_1$\noptimisation identifies a relatively large number $N^*=98$ of\ndominant sources and the error of the `sparse' reconstruction\nincreases significantly compared with the reconstruction using all\n$576$ source points. However, once noise is present in the pressure\ndata then sparse representations of the solution can be obtained\nwith a similar level of accuracy to the Tikhonov approach. The\nreason for this can be explained by considering how the data\nfidelity parameter $\\epsilon$ is chosen in (\\ref{L1reg1}).

The\ncomputations shown use $\\beta=0.5$ to generate the sparse scheme\nleading to $N^*=30$ dominant charge points (of $1024$ in total). The\npercentage error in the sparse reconstruction is \\textsc{21.19\\%},\nwhich is the same (up to the quoted level of accuracy) as the error\nusing all $1024$ charge points for the reconstruction. We note that\nthe boundary data to be reconstructed has $52$ out of $1024$ entries\nthat are non-zero. Relatively significant errors arise in the quiet\nregions of the locally vibrating object, close to the edges of the\ncuboid that are nearest the vibrating region. If we assume prior\nknowledge of the non-vibrating regions and consider only the\naccuracy of the reconstruction over the vibrating region, then the\nerror reduces to \\textsc{9.843\\%} for both the sparse and full data\nreconstructions. A plot of this post-processed result is shown in\nthe lower left subplot of Fig. \\ref{twoplot}.\n\nThe lower right subplot of Fig. \\ref{twoplot} shows the result of\nreconstructing the Neumann boundary data starting only with the $30$\ndominant source points identified by the sparse reconstruction\nmethod and using a reduced data set sampled from the full data set\nat $800$ randomly selected points. The same post-processing\nprocedure as described above has been applied to fix the solution in\nthe non-vibrating regions to zero. The results shown are computed\nusing Tikhonov regularisation (with only the 30 charge points\nidentified by the initial sparse reconstruction), which gave\nslightly better accuracy than using the sparse reconstruction\nalgorithm for a second time. The percentage error in the plotted\nreconstruction is \\textsc{18.89\\%}, compared with \\textsc{26.36\\%}\nfor the reconstruction without post-processing. Using the sparse\nalgorithm to reconstruct the solution instead gave errors around\n$3\\%$ higher in each case. Note that these results all show an\nimprovement on the reconstruction obtained from the same reduced\nacoustic data set, but using a basis with all $1024$ charge points.\nIn this case the percentage error was more than doubled to\n\\textsc{58.87\\%}, and improved to \\textsc{46.52\\%} after\npost-processing. We remark that the reconstruction using the full\nbasis with reduced data is an under-determined problem (the acoustic\ndata are fewer than the number of unknowns), whereas the\nreconstruction from the sparse basis is over-determined. This\nsuggests that reducing the number of charge points and changing the\nunder-determined problem into an over-determined one is an important\nstep for the efficient implementation of NAH with reduced data using\nthe method of superposition. \\emph{The main result of this section\nis that sparse reconstruction methods can still be applied when a\nsuitable choice of dictionary of basis functions for the sparse\nreconstruction is not obvious, provided there is some inherent\nsparsity that can be exploited. Sparse reconstructions can also be\nused in conjunction with reduced acoustic field data sets giving\nreasonable results. In particular, the sparse basis representation\nleads to better accuracy and more efficient calculations than using\nthe full basis with the reduced data set.}\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nThe method of superposition has been combined with a sparse $\\ell_1$\nreconstruction algorithm and applied to the problem of near-field\nacoustic holography. The developed sparse superposition method is\nable to reconstruct the normal velocity of a vibrating object using\nonly a very small number of charge points in many cases, in contrast\nwith a standard Tikhonov reconstruction. In particular, it appears\nthat competitive sparse reconstructions can be generated provided\nthe wavenumber is not too large and that the data can be assumed to\nbe sufficiently noisy to permit a data fidelity parameter of at\nleast $5\\%$ of the size of the $\\ell_2$ norm of the exterior\npressure data. Sparsity also appears to be an important factor when\nconsidering reduced acoustic field data sets, where reconstructions\nusing a sparse basis gave a considerable improvement in accuracy\nover using the full basis with all charge points. The results of the\nsimulations point to a number of important future developments. The\nsparse superposition method could be used to generate initial\nconditions for the method of fundamental solutions, whereby the\naccuracy of the reconstruction is optimised over both the charge\npoint strengths and locations using a non-linear optimisation\nalgorithm. This technique could also be applied more widely to\nsource identification problems, as the results have shown that when\nthe charge points are close to point sources generating the exterior\npressure data then the reconstruction becomes very sparse, and the\ncharge points close to the generating point source are highly\ndominant.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\nN.M.

In particular,\nwhen noise is added the solutions can be accurately reconstructed\nusing only 10 to 15 of the 576 source points. This is further\nillustrated in Figure \\ref{fourplot} which shows the reconstructed\nsolution with noise level $w=0.15$ (or equivalently\n$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}}=16.48\\mathrm{dB}$) using each of the\nthree solution strategies described above. The exact solution is\nalso shown for reference.\n\nIn all three cases we achieve a faithful reconstruction of the\nNeumann data on the cuboid since the match to the exact solution is\nvery good. Plots of the cases $w=0$ and $w=0.05$ are omitted for\nbrevity, since as shown in Table \\ref{T1}, the reconstruction errors\nin these cases are even smaller and the likeness to the exact\nsolution shown in Figure \\ref{fourplot} would be even stronger.\n\\emph{The main result of this section is that $\\ell_1$ sparse\nregularisation can give similar accuracy to Tikhonov regularisation\nfor noisy data, but with a small fraction of the number of charge\npoints required to produce the reconstruction.}\n\n\n\\subsection{Higher and irregular frequencies}\n\nWe now investigate the behavior of the method for some potentially\nproblematic choices of the wavenumber $k$. First we look at the case\nwhen the frequency is increased, including when the Nyquist\nfrequency is exceeded. Since our measurements are taken at triangle\ncentroids then the resulting measurement grid is irregular and so\nthe Nyquist frequency is not well-defined. We therefore choose the\nNyquist frequency associated with the regular grid given by the\ntriangle vertices, as a value approximately representative of the\nNyquist frequency. For the discretisation considered in the previous\nsection with $576$ triangles, the grid spacing is $\\Delta x =\n0.04667$, meaning that the wavenumber corresponding to the Nyquist\nfrequency is $k_{\\mathrm{nyq}}=\\pi/\\Delta x= 67.32$. We also\ninvestigate the performance of the method close to other typical\nthreshold frequencies for numerical solution approaches, such as the\nsix grid points per wavelength rule of thumb for finite and boundary\nelement methods, which gives a maximum wavenumber of $k=22.44$ for\nthe grid described above. The performance of the method at irregular\nfrequencies will also be investigated. For the method of\nsuperposition these irregular frequencies are the resonances of the\nregion enclosed by the interior source surface \\cite{GK89}.\nNumerical studies indicate that one such frequency is close to\n$k^*=17.54/\\alpha$, which here is $k=52.62$.\n\nTable \\ref{T2} gives the reconstruction error for a range of\nwavenumbers $k$ using $\\ell_1$ reconstruction techniques and\ncompares the accuracy of the reconstruction using all 576 charge\npoints, and using two different values of the sparsity parameter\n$\\beta$. In particular, we compare the default choice used in the\nlast section of $\\beta=0.5$ with the choice $\\beta=0.9$, which uses\nfewer charge points but at the potential cost of poorer accuracy.\nThe maximum wavenumber studied corresponds to the wavelength being\nclose to (but still greater than) the exterior measurement distance\n$\\delta$. The results show that both irregular and high frequencies\nlead to a degradation in the accuracy of the reconstruction, and\nlead to a loss of sparsity in the reconstructions. Accurate and\nreasonably sparse reconstructions can be generated provided there\nare at least 3 data points per wavelength since for up to $k=44.88$\nwe can reconstruct the solution with a smaller error than the level\nof added noise ($15\\%$) and with at least an order of magnitude\nreduction from the total number of charge points (576). These\nresults are consistent with the findings of Ref. \\cite{AB08}, where\nit is also suggested that a superposition method will give accurate\nresults provided there are at least 3 degrees of freedom per\nwavelength. We note that if the surface of interior charge points\nincludes the monopole generating the acoustic field then one would\nobtain exact representations for arbitrarily high frequencies.\n\nIn addition to the general trend of increased errors for higher\nfrequencies, one also observes a local peak in the error at the\ncharacteristic wavenumber $k=52.62$. Here we see that the error is\nparticularly poor for the sparse reconstruction with $\\beta=0.9$,\nand that there is also a local peak in the number of dominant charge\npoints. This suggests that sparse reconstructions are not feasible\nat higher frequencies or at irregular frequencies. However, the\nreconstruction error is lower than the noise level for the schemes\nusing all charge points or with $\\beta=0.5$ for all frequencies\ntested up to twice the Nyquist frequency. The results of this\nsection therefore suggest that the method of superposition with\n$\\ell_1$ regularisation can provide excellent reconstructions for\nfrequencies up to around twice the Nyquist frequency, and that\nsparse reconstructions are feasible provided we have at least three\ndata points per wavelength. Irregular frequencies degrade both\naccuracy and sparsity. However, if a more accurate and sparsely\nreconstructed solution was required at $k=52.62$, then we could\nchange the scaling of the internal source surface (i.e. change\n$\\alpha$) which would move the location of the irregular frequency.\nChanging $\\alpha$ from $1/3$ to $0.4$ leads to a percentage error of\n\\textsc{6.131\\%} for both the full reconstruction and the sparse\nscheme with $\\beta=0.5$, which identifies $N^*(0.5)=102$ dominant\ncharge points. For $\\beta=0.9$, the error increases to\n$\\textsc{16.00\\%}$ with $N^*(0.9)=63$. Note that these results are\nfar more consistent with the other results shown in Table \\ref{T2}\nand the removal of the local error peaks is shown more clearly in\nFig. \\ref{kchange}, where the diamond symbols show the values\ncomputed with $\\alpha=0.4$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n          \\epsfig{file=kchange, width=\\textwidth}\n        \\caption{\\label{kchange} The accuracy and sparsity of the reconstructed solutions with $15\\%$ added noise, $\\alpha=1/3$ and $z_{0}=0.05$. The plots show the effect of changing the wavenumber $k$, including the effect of irregular frequencies and values above the Nyquist frequency.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe results presented by Chardon \\emph{et. al.} \\cite{GC12} using\nsparse plane wave reconstructions indicate that randomising the\nexterior data point locations (measurement locations) within the\nhologram plane facilitates sparse reconstructions above the Nyquist\nlimit. Unfortunately, the reconstructed solutions using the method\nof superposition lose their sparsity at frequencies around and above\nthe Nyquist limit and randomising the data point locations has been\nobserved to degrade the accuracy of the reconstructed solution in\ngeneral across the range of wavenumbers studied in Fig.\n\\ref{kchange}. These observations are consistent with the findings\nin Ref. \\cite{MB10}. \\emph{The main result of this section is that\nalthough in certain special cases  $\\ell_1$ sparse regularisation\ncould give exact representations up to arbitrarily high frequencies,\nin general the reconstruction accuracy will decrease at higher\nfrequencies. Irregular frequencies can also be treated simply by\nperturbing the surface of interior charge points.}\n\n\n\\subsection{Dependance on the singularity and charge point locations}\n\nThe results in the previous sections all reconstructed the Neumann\ndata generated from a point source located on the $z-$axis at\n$z_{0}=0.05$. This ensured that the singularity in the solution of\nthe related interior problem was located within the interior charge\npoint surface for $\\alpha=1/3$. We now consider how the accuracy and\nsparsity of our reconstructed solutions depends on both the position\nof an interior source point generating the exterior pressure data,\nand the relative size/ position of the internal charge point surface\ncontrolled by the parameter $\\alpha$ as described in Eq.\n(\\ref{alpha}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n          \\epsfig{file=zchange, width=\\textwidth}\n        \\caption{\\label{zchange} The accuracy and sparsity of the reconstructed solutions with $k=1$ and $15\\%$ added noise. The plots show the effect of using a range of different sized interior charge point surfaces and different positions for the source point generating the boundary data.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig. \\ref{zchange} shows both the percentage errors for the sparse\nreconstructions and the value of the sparsity parameter $N^*(0.5)$\nfor different sized interior charge point surfaces and for different\npositions of the point source generating the exterior data. These\nquantities have been computed for values of $\\alpha$ between $0.1$\nand $0.8$, and for $z_{0}$ between $z_{0}=0$ and $z_{0}=0.15$.\nInstead of showing values of the parameter $\\alpha$, Fig.\n\\ref{zchange} shows the corresponding $z-$coordinate where the\ninterior charge point surface intersects the positive $z-$axis. In\nthis way we are able to indicate the size of the interior charge\npoint surface relative to the location of $z_{0}$ on the same axes.\nNote that since $\\Gamma$ intersects the positive $z$-axis at\n$z=0.21$ (it is centred at the origin with total height $0.42$m),\nthen the internal source surface with, for example, $\\alpha=0.5$\nwill intersect the positive $z$-axis at $z=0.105$, and this is the\nvalue used along the horizontal axis in Fig. \\ref{zchange}. In all\ncases the added noise level is $15\\%$. Note that the relative errors\nobtained when reconstructing the solution using all charge points\ndiffers from that given by the sparse reconstruction by less than\n$1\\%$.\n\n\nEach subplot of Fig. \\ref{zchange} shows four curves, corresponding\nto each of four choices of $z_{0}$, and four vertical lines\nindicating the positions of the corresponding point $z_{0}$. The\nleft subplot shows the percentage errors for different choices of\ninterior source surface. We notice that the errors are minimised\nwhen the size of the interior source surface is such that it\nintersects the positive $z-$axis close to $z=z_{0}$, where the curve\ncrosses its corresponding vertical line. Likewise, this right\nsubplot shows that the number of charge points $N^*$ needed to\nobtain a sparse reconstruction is also minimal when the size of the\ninterior source surface is such that it intersects the positive\n$z-$axis close to $z=z_{0}$. In general, the solutions are\nreasonably accurate for source surfaces intersecting the positive\n$z-$axis between $z=0.05$ and $z=0.1$, corresponding to choosing\n$\\alpha=0.3$ or $\\alpha=0.4$. Choosing $\\alpha=0.8$ so that the\nsource surface intersects the positive $z-$axis at $z=0.168$ gave\nthe worst results in general. Interestingly, the results of this\nsection suggest that it doesn't seem to be critical whether or not\nthe surface of interior charge points encloses any singularities in\nthe modelled wave field. Furthermore, the results also point to\nimportant potential applications of the sparse superposition method\ndeveloped in this work for source identification problems in\ngeneral.\n\n\\emph{The main result of this section is that both the accuracy and\nsparsity of the reconstructed solution is enhanced when the surface\nof interior charge points includes points close to the location of\nthe interior monopole generating the acoustic field. A major\nstrength of the sparse reconstruction approach described here will\ntherefore be in its application to source identification problems.}\n\n\\subsection{Example of a locally radiating structure}\n\nIn this section we consider the problem of reconstructing the\nvibrations of a structure which is rigid, except over a relatively\nsmall region. This is both a typical assumption for applications to\nloudspeakers, and is also typical of problems commonly modelled\nusing the method of patch NAH, whereby measurements and\nreconstructions only take place in the vicinity of the vibrating\nregion (see for example Refs. \\cite{AS05,EW03}). In the present\nstudy we use such an example for verification of the sparse\nsuperposition method for a problem where the pressure data is not\ngenerated by a monopole point source, and hence an optimal choice\nfor the surface of internal charge points would not be related to\nthe location of such a monopole.\n\nWe consider reconstructing Neumann boundary data given by a raised\ncosine function\n\n", "index": 35, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{bcloc}\n\\frac{\\partial\np}{\\partial\\mathbf{n}_{x}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\cos(10\\pi\n|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_0|))\\right),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E17.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial\\mathbf{n}_{x}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\cos(%&#10;10\\pi|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_{0}|))\\right),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>cos</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>10</mn><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>)</mo><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
