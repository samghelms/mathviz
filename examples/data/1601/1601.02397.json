In\ncase (a), $N_f(\\mathbf{x})=N_f$ for all site $\\mathbf{x}$ in our\nsimulation domain. In case (b) we choose $N_f(\\mathbf{x})$\nrandomly at each site $\\mathbf{x}$; $N_f(\\mathbf{x})$ can be any\ninteger from 0 to $N_f$, with equal probability for any one of\nthese values.\n\n\\subsection{Methods}\n\\label{method}\n\nOur 2D and 3D simulation domains are, respectively, squares\n($1024\\times1024$ grid points) and rectangular parallelepipeds\n($1024\\times1024\\times8$ grid points). We use 5-point and\n7-point stencils for the Laplacian in 2D and 3D, respectively,\nand a finite-difference scheme with step sizes $\\delta x = \\delta\ny = 0.25$~mm in 2D, and $\\delta x = \\delta y = \\delta z =\n0.25$~mm in 3D, i.e., our simulation domains are\n$256\\times256$~mm$^3$ (in 2D) and $256\\times256\\times2$~mm$^2$\n(in 3D). For time marching we use a forward-Euler scheme with\n$\\delta t =0.02$~ms. We use Neumann (no-flux) conditions at the\nboundaries of our simulation domain.\n\nFor numerical efficiency, we have carried out our simulations on\nparallel computers, with an MPI code that we have developed for\nthe TP06 model. Our code divides the 2D (or 3D) simulation domain\ninto $n$ columns (or slabs) along the $x$-direction of the\ndomain, i.e., each processor carries out the computations for\n$(1024/n) \\times 1024$  and $(1024/n) \\times 1024 \\times 16$ grid\npoints, respectively, for 2D and 3D domains. To compute the\nLaplacian at the interface of processor boundaries, we use two\nextra grid lines (or surfaces), which can send and\nreceive the data from left- and right-neighbor processors. The\nNeumann boundary condition is taken care of by adding an extra\nlayer of grid points on the boundaries of the simulation domain\nof each processor. \n\nReference~\\cite{clayton:2008} suggests that we must have $D\n\\delta t/({\\delta x}^2) < 1/2d$ for numerical stability, where\n$d$ is the dimension of the simulation domain. For the TP06\nmodel, with diffusion coefficients $D=\n0.00154$~cm$^2$/ms~\\cite{tp06}, time step $\\delta t =0.02$~ms,\nand space step $\\delta x =0.25$~mm, the value of $D\\delta\nt/(\\delta x)^2$ is $\\simeq 0.05$; for the TP06 model, the\nquantity $1/2d = 0.25$ and $\\simeq 0.17$, for the 2D and 3D\ndomains, respectively, i.e., we have numerical stability because\n$D\\delta t/(\\delta x)^2 < 1/2d$.  \n\nWe check the accuracy of our numerical scheme, as in\nRef.~\\cite{clayton:2008}, by varying both  $\\delta t$ and $\\delta\nx$ in a cable-type domain of\nmyocytes~\\cite{thesis:alok,nayak:2013} and by measuring CV of a\nplane wave, which is injected into the domain by stimulating its\nleft boundary for $3$~ms with a stimulus of strength $150$~pA.\nWith $\\delta x=0.25$~mm, CV increases by $1.1\\%$ when we change\n$\\delta t$ from $0.02$ to $0.01$ ms; if we decrease $\\delta x$\nfrom $0.25$ to $0.15$~mm, with $\\delta t=0.02$~ms, then CV\nincreases by $3.1\\%$; these changes are similar to those found in\nother\nstudies~\\cite{tnnp04,clayton:2008,shajahan:2009,thesis:alok}.\n\nAlthough the numerical method we use satisfies both\nnumerical-stability and accuracy conditions, an inappropriately\nlarge  $\\delta x$ can give irregular wavefront-curvature, as a\nconsequence of numerical\nartifacts~\\cite{clayton:2008,nayak:2013,thesis:alok}; this leads\nto unphysical wave dynamics. We check that our results are free\nfrom such numerical artifacts by investigating the spatiotemporal\nevolution of an expanding wave front that emerges from a point\nstimulus. We find that fronts of the expanding wave do not\ndeviate substantially from circles, when we apply a point\nstimulus of strength $450$~pA for $3$~ms at the center of the\ndomain.\n\nWe use two parameter sets P1 and P2 for myocytes to obtain,\nrespectively, a stable rotating spiral (RS) and a spiral-turbulence \n(ST) states in our 2D simulation domain, and a stable\nrotating scroll or scroll-wave turbulence in our 3D domain. The\nparameter set P1 is the original one used in the TP06\nmodel~\\cite{tp06,nayak:2013,thesis:alok}. In the P2 parameter\nset, we use the following parameters, with all other parameters\nthe same as in the original TP06 model: (a) $G_{Kr}$, the\n$I_{Kr}$ conductance, is $0.172$~nS/pF; (b) $G_{Ks}$, the\n$I_{Ks}$ conductance, is $0.441$~nS/pF; (c) $G_{pCa}$, the\n$I_{pCa}$ conductance, is $0.8666$~nS/pF; (d) $G_{pK}$, the\n$I_{pK}$ conductance, is $0.00219$~nS/pF; and (e) $\\tau_f$, the\ntime constant of the $f$ gating variable that is associated with the\n$I_{CaL}$ current, is increased $2$ times compared to its value\nin the TP06 model~\\cite{tp06,nayak:2013,thesis:alok}. Our\nfibroblasts parameters are as follows: $C_f=6.3$~pF, $G_f=4$~nS,\n$E_f=-49.0$~mV, and $G_j$ in the range $0 \\le G_j \\le\n6$~nS~\\cite{nayak:2013,xie:2009a}.\n\nTo obtain spiral and scroll waves we use the S1-S2 cross-field\nprotocol~\\cite{nayak:2014,majumder:book,thesis:alok}. We apply a\nstimulus (S1) of strength $150$~pA for $3$~ms to the left\nboundaries of our simulation domains, to form a plane wave. We\nthen apply the second (S2) stimulus, with the same strength and\nduration as the S1 stimulus, from the bottom boundary and with\n$0~{\\rm mm} \\leq y \\leq 125~{\\rm mm}$ in 2D, and $0~{\\rm mm} \\leq\ny \\leq 125~{\\rm mm}$ and $0~{\\rm mm} \\leq z \\leq 2~{\\rm mm}$ in\n3D. This protocol leads to the formation of spiral and scroll\nwaves, respectively, in our 2D and 3D domains.\n\nTo examine the spatiotemporal evolution of our system, we obtain\npseudocolor or isosurface plots of $V_m$, time series of $V_m$,\nfrom representative points ($x = 125$ mm, $y = 125$ mm for 2D, and \n$x= 125$ mm, $y = 125$ mm, $z=1.25$ mm for 3D), which we mark with  an\nasterisk ($\\ast$) in all pseudocolor plots of $V_m$. We examine the\ninter-beat interval (IBI), by using this time series with $4.4\n\\times 10^5$ data points; the IBI is the interval between two\nsuccessive spikes in this time series. We obtain the power\nspectra $E(\\omega)$, of the time series of $V_m$, by using $2\n\\times 10^5$ data points; to eliminate transients we remove the\ninitial $2.4 \\times 10^5$ data points. \nTo obtain the rotation period T of a spiral, in an RS state, we\naverage over the last $5$ rotations of that RS.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{result}\n\nIn subsection~\\ref{spiralwave}, we begin by studying spiral-wave\ndynamics in a 2D domain of myocytes without fibroblasts; we then\nintroduce fibroblasts, either regularly or randomly, and examine\nthe effects they have on spiral-wave dynamics.\nSubsection~\\ref{scrollwave} contains the results of our studies\nof scroll-wave dynamics in our 3D simulation domain.\n\n\\subsection{Spiral-wave dynamics in our 2D model}\n\\label{spiralwave}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(A), we show a pseudocolor plot of $V_m$,\nat time $t=8.8$~s, for the parameter set P1, in our 2D simulation\ndomain without fibroblasts; the initial condition evolves to a\nstate with a single rotating spiral (RS). The local time series of\n$V_m(x,y,t)$, from the representative point shown by the asterisk\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(A)), is given in Fig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(B)\nfor $0~{\\rm s}\\le t \\le 8.8~{\\rm s}$; a plot of the IBI versus\nthe beat number is given in Fig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(C), which shows\nthat, after initial transients, the spiral wave rotates\nperiodically with an average rotation period $T \\simeq 212$~ms.\nThe power spectrum $E(\\omega)$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(D) has\ndiscrete peaks at the fundamental frequency $\\omega_f\\simeq\n4.75$~Hz and its harmonics.  The periodic time series of $V_m$,\nthe flattening of the IBI, and the discrete peaks in $E(\\omega)$\ndemonstrate that the time evolution of the spiral wave, with the\nP1 parameter set, is periodic. In Figs.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(E)-(H),\nwe show the exact analogs of Figs.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(A)-(B) for\nthe P2 parameter set.  The non-periodic local time series in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(F), the fluctuating IBI in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(G), and the broad-band nature of $E(\\omega)$\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(H) are characteristic of the ST state.\nThe pseudocolor plot in Fig.~\\ref{fig:myo2d}(E), at time\n$t=8.8$~s, shows such an ST state, which arises from the steep slope of\nthe action-potential-duration-restitution (APDR)\nplot~\\cite{tp06,nayak:pre}. In summary, then, in the absence of\nfibroblasts, the parameter sets P1 and P2 lead, respectively, to\n(a) an RS state and (b) an ST state in our 2D simulation domain.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figspdf/MyoRSST}  \n\\caption{\nThe rotating-spiral (RS) and spiral-turbulence (ST) states in a\n2D domain in the absence of fibroblasts.

((C)-(D)) The rotation period T of RS\nincreases as $N_f$ increases, for a fixed value of $G_j$, and\nvice-versa, for both the P1 and P2 parameter sets.}\n\\label{fig:reg2d}\t\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe now examine the effects of fibroblasts on spiral-wave dynamics\nin both RS and ST states. We begin our investigation with the\nP1 parameter set and with the regularly attached fibroblast model\nwith $1 \\leq N_f \\leq 6$ and $1~{\\rm nS} \\leq G_j \\leq 8~{\\rm\nnS}$; the remaining parameters for fibroblasts are as in\nsubsection~\\ref{method}.\n\nIn Figs.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}(A1)-(A4) we show pseudocolor plots of\n$V_m$, at time $t=8.8~$s, with the P1 parameter set for regularly\nattached fibroblast model with $G_j=4$~nS and different values of\n$N_f$. The analogs of Figs.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}(A1)-(A4) are shown in\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}(B1)-(B4) for the P2 parameter set. The\nplots in the first row of Fig.~\\ref{fig:reg2d} show that the RS\nstate, which we obtain in the absence of fibroblasts, does not\nevolve into an ST state; however, the spiral-arm width $W_d$\ndecreases as we increase $N_f$, for a fixed value of $G_j$ (first\nrow of Fig.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}).  We define $W_d$ to be the\ndifference of the radial distance between the wave front and the\nwave back of a spiral arm, whose center is located at the spiral\ncore. Such a decrease of $W_d$ is related to the shortening of\nthe action-potential-duration (APD) of a myocyte-fibroblast\ncomposite that has been discussed in\nRefs.~\\cite{nayak:pre,nayak:2013}. \n\nFor the P2 parameter set, we observe a transition from an ST to\nan RS state as we increase $N_f$ for a fixed value of $G_j$\n(second row of Fig.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}). Such an ST-RS transition is\nthe consequence of the suppression of the steep APDR slope of a\nmyocyte-fibroblast composite at the cellular\nlevel~\\cite{nayak:pre,petrov:2010}. Once the ST state is\nsuppressed, a single spiral in an RS state rotates periodically\nas shown Figs.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}((B2)-(B4)). In Figs.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}(C) and\n(D), we plot, respectively, the rotation period T of a spiral\nwave in an RS state versus $N_f$, for different values of $G_j$,\nfor the P1 and P2 parameter sets.  We find that T increases as (i) $N_f$\nincreases, with a fixed value of $G_j$, and (ii) $G_j$ increases,\nwith a fixed value of $N_f$.  This increase of T is a\nconsequence of the decrease of CV that is associated with a\ndecrease of the upstroke velocity of a myocyte-fibroblast\ncomposite AP in its depolarization phase, as shown in\nRefs.~\\cite{nayak:2013,nayak:pre,xie:2009}.  Furthermore, we\nobserve that the minimum value of $N_f$, required for the ST-RS\ntransition, decreases as $G_j$ increases, for the P2 parameter\nset.\n\nWe focus next on spiral-wave dynamics, with P1 and P2 parameter\nsets, in our randomly attached fibroblast model.  In\nFig.~\\ref{fig:rand2d}, we show the exact analogs of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}, but now for the randomly attached\nfibroblast model.  The pseudocolor plots in\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:rand2d}(A1)-(A4) show that the randomness in\nattaching fibroblasts does not lead to an RS-ST transition for\nthe P1 parameter set. However, inspite of the randomness in the\narrangement of fibroblasts, we observe an ST-RS transition for\nthe P2 parameter set (see Figs.~\\ref{fig:rand2d}(B1)-(B4)), which\nis qualitatively similar to the ST-RS transition in the P1 case\n(compare the second rows of Figs.~\\ref{fig:reg2d} and\n\\ref{fig:rand2d}). However, the minimum value of $N_f$, required\nfor an ST-RS transition, is higher for the randomly attached\nfibroblast model than in the regularly attached case (compare\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}(D) and \\ref{fig:rand2d}(D)). \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figspdf/RandomFbs}  \n\\caption{\nVarious RS and ST states in our 2D domain for the randomly\nattached fibroblast model (this figure is the analog of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:reg2d}).

For both the P1 and P2 parameter sets and\nboth regularly and randomly attached fibroblast models, we carry\nout simulations to study the dependence of scroll-wave dynamics\non $N_f$ and $G_j$. We present our numerical results below.\n\nIn Figs.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}(A1), (A2), (A3) and (A4), we show,\nrespectively, isosurface plots of $V_m$, at time $t=8.8$~ms, for\nthe P1 parameter set in our regularly attached fibroblast model\nwith $G_j=4$~nS and $N_f=0$ (i.e., isolated myocytes), $N_f=1$,\n$N_f=2$, and $N_f=4$.  In the absence of fibroblasts, i.e.,\n$N_f=0$, the P1 parameter set displays a rotating scroll wave\nwith fundamental frequency $\\omega_f \\simeq 5$~Hz and rotation\nperiod T $\\simeq$ 201~ms; this is consistent, because\n$\\omega_f\\simeq1/{\\rm T}$. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}(C), we plot T\nversus $N_f$ for $G_j=$~1 nS ($\\bullet$) and 4~nS\n($\\filledtriangleup$). We find that T increases as we increase\n(i) $N_f$, for a fixed value of $G_j$, or (ii) $G_j$, for a fixed\nvalue of $N_f$. In Figs.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}((B1)-(B4)) and (D), we\nshow, respectively, the exact analogs of\nFigs.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}((A1)-(A4)) and (C), for the P2 parameter\nset. In the absence of fibroblasts and for the P2 parameter set,\nwe obtain a scroll-wave-turbulence state\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}(B1)); this scroll-wave turbulence is\nconverted to a rotating scroll if we have $N_f >1$ (second row of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}). Once the scroll-wave turbulence state is\nsuppressed, a rotating scoll rotates with a period T, which\nincreases as we increase $N_f$ for a fixed value of $G_j$, and\nvice-versa (Fig.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}(D)).  Furthermore, from\nFig.~\\ref{fig:reg3d}(D), we find that the minimum value of $N_f$,\nrequired for the  ST-RS transition, is 4 and 2, respectively, for\n$G_j=$ 1~nS ($\\bullet$) and 4~nS ($\\filledtriangleup$). The\nisosurface plots in Fig.~\\ref{fig:reg3d} show that the width\n$W_d$ of a scroll-wave arm in the rotating-scroll state decreases\nas we increase $N_f$ for both the P1 and P2 parameter sets. The\nmechanisms of the ST-RS transition, and increase of T and a decrease of\n$W_d$, as we increase $N_f$ and $G_j$, are the same as those\nwe have found in our 2D studies.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:rand3d} we show the exact analog of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:reg3d} for the randomly attached fibroblast model,\nwith both the P1 and P2 parameter sets. Our\nscroll-wave results here are similar to those for the case of\nregularly attached fibroblast model.  From\nFig.~\\ref{fig:rand3d}(D), we find that the minimum value of $N_f$,\nfor the ST-RS transition, is 5 and 3, respectively, for $G_j=1$~nS\n($\\bullet$) and 4~nS ($\\filledtriangleup$). Note that this\nminimum value of $N_f$ is higher for the randomly attached\nfibroblast model than it is for the regularly attached\nfibroblast model (compare Figs.\\ref{fig:reg3d}(D) and\n\\ref{fig:rand3d}(D)).\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{conclusion}\n\nWe have presented the most extensive numerical study carried out\nso far of the effects of fibroblasts on spiral- and scroll-wave\ndynamics in a mathematical model for human ventricular tissue with\nfibroblasts, attached regularly or randomly to myocytes.  Our\nnumerical study has been designed to uncover the role of (i) the\norganization of fibroblasts in ventricular tissue ( i.e., to\ncompare regular and random arrangements), (ii) myocyte-fibroblast\ncoupling $G_j$, and (iii) the density of fibroblasts, i.e.,\nthe maximum number of fibroblasts $N_f$ attached to a myocyte.  One\nof the principal results of our studies is that spiral- and\nscroll-wave dynamics depend only slightly on the details of the\norganization of fibroblasts in ventricular tissue. However, the\nST-RS transition, the stability of spiral- and scroll-wave\nturbulence, the rotation period of a rotating spiral and scroll,\nand the width of a rotating spiral and scroll arms, depend\nsensitively on $N_f$ and $G_j$. \n\nEarlier studies have investigated the effects of fibroblasts on\nspiral-wave dynamics by introducing randomly diffuse fibroblasts\nin a myocyte domain~\\cite{zlochiver:2008,majumder:2012}. Such\nrandomly diffuse fibroblasts in a myocyte domain inhibit\nelectrical-wave propagation, and initiate spiral-wave turbulence\nstate. Studies by Xie, \\textit{et al}~\\cite{xie:2009} have found\nthat spiral-wave breakup occurs, in an LR1 model, because of randomly\ndiffuse fibroblasts in a localized area of a simulation domain;\nZlochiver, \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{zlochiver:2008} have shown from\ntheir experiments and simulations that a rotating spiral becomes\nunstable and, finally, spiral breakup occurs, as they increase the\npercentage of diffuse fibroblasts.  Majumder, \\textit{et\nal.}~\\cite{majumder:2012} have shown from their numerical\nexperiments that a transition from an RS to various ST states\noccurs depending on the percentage of fibroblasts in their\nsimulation domain. In our attached-fibroblast model studies,\nfibroblasts do not inhibit wave propagation~\\cite{nayak:2013};\nhowever, fibroblasts attached to a myocyte can lower the\nsteepness of the APDR curve, depending on the values of $G_j$ and\n$N_f$~\\cite{nayak:pre,petrov:2010}. Such a lowering of the steep\nslope of the APDR eliminates spiral- and scroll-wave turbulence\nin our 2D and 3D simulation\ndomains~\\cite{qu:2000,qu:2000a,weiss:2000,garfinkel:2000}.\nTherefore, we observe an ST-RS transition.  Earlier studies in\nRef.~\\cite{petrov:2010} have observed ST-RS spiral-wave\ntransitions because of a suppression of the steep portion of the\nAPDR slope in a 3D model consisting of myocytes, fibroblasts, and\nextracellular space by using the LR1 model~\\cite{lr1}. However,\nthose studies have not investigated the spiral- and scroll-wave\ntransition as a function of $N_f$ and $G_j$. Our study shows that\nboth $N_f$ and $G_j$ are important factors during the fibrosis\nprocess~\\cite{nguyen:2014,biernacka:2011}. \n\nWe suggest that our results from \\textit{in silico} studies can\nbe verified in \\textit{in vitro} experiments. Furthermore, by\nusing advanced cell-culture\ntechniques~\\cite{haraguchi:2012,shimizu:2002,baudino:2008}, our\n2D and 3D numerical results can be tested easily in\n\\textit{cell-culture} experiments.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nWe thank the Department of Science and Technology (DST), India,\nthe University Grants Commission (UGC), India, and the Robert\nBosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems (RBCCPS), IISc, for\nsupport.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apsrev} \n\\bibliography{references}\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 10671, "prevtext": "\n\n\\title{The effects of fibroblasts on wave dynamics in a\nmathematical model for human ventricular tissue}\n\n\\author{Alok Ranjan Nayak$^{1}$}\n\\email{alok@cps.iisc.ernet.in}\n\\author{Rahul Pandit$^{2}$}\n\\email{rahul@physics.iisc.ernet.in}\n\n\\affiliation{\n$^1$Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber Physical Systems,\nIndian Institute of Science, \nBangalore 560012, India.\\\\\n$^2$Centre for Condensed Matter Theory,\nDepartment of Physics, Indian Institute of Science,\nBangalore 560012, India.}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{abstract}{\nWe present systematic numerical studies of electrical-wave\npropagation in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)\nmathematical models, for human, ventricular tissue with myocyte\ncells that are attached (a) regularly and (b) randomly to\ndistributed fibroblasts.  In both these cases we show that there\nis a parameter regime in which single rotating spiral- and\nscroll-wave states (RS) retain their integrity and do not evolve\nto a state ST that displays spatiotemporal chaos and turbulence.\nHowever, in another range of parameters, we observe a transition\nfrom ST to RS states in both 2D or 3D domains and for both cases\n(a) and (b).  Our studies show that the ST-RS transition and\nrotation period of a spiral or scroll wave in the RS state\ndepends on (i) the coupling strength between myocytes and\nfibroblasts and (ii) the number of fibroblasts attached to\nmyocytes. We conclude that myocyte-fibroblast coupling strength\nand the number of fibroblasts are more important for the ST-RS\ntransition than the precise way in which fibroblasts are\ndistributed over myocyte tissue.}\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{Mathematical Model, Fibroblasts, Action-potential-duration-restitution, Spiral-wave dynamics}\n\n\\pacs{87.19.Hh, 89.75.Kd, 05.45.-a}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{intro}\n\nApproximately $16\\%$ of all deaths in the industrialized world\nare caused by cardiac arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia\n(VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF)~\\cite{vf:1,vf:2}. There is\na broad consensus that the analogs of VT and VF in mathematical\nmodels for cardiac tissue are, respectively, (a) a single\nrotating spiral or scroll wave of electrical activation and (b)\nspiral-wave or scroll-wave turbulence, which displays broken\nelectrical waves and spatiotemporal\nchaos~\\cite{davidenko:1992,pertsov:1993,gray:1998,jalife:1998}.\nThus, it is very important of study such spiral and scroll waves\nto develop an understanding of life-threatening cardiac\narrhythmias. Such studies are truly interdisciplinary because\nthey require inputs from biology, bio-medical engineering,\ncardiology, on the one hand, and physics, nonlinear dynamics, and\nnumerical methods, on the other. We use  methods from these areas\nto solve the nonlinear, partial-differential equations for\nstate-of-the-art mathematical models for cardiac tissue with\nmyocytes and fibroblasts.  We build on our earlier studies of\nthis problem~\\cite{nayak:2013,nayak:pre} to elucidate the role of\ntwo different forms of myocyte-fibroblast couplings on spiral-\nand scroll-wave dynamics in such models by using theoretical\nideas from spatiotemporal chaos.\n\nIt is useful to begin with an overview of experimental and\ncomputational studies of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts.\nCardiac fibroblasts, which are inexcitable cells, often multiply\nand connect with cardiac myocytes during\n\\textit{fibrosis}~\\cite{krenning:2010,biernacka:2011,souders:2009},\na process of cardiac-tissue healing after a myocardial\ninfarction. Fibroblasts in cell culture and in intact tissue can\ncouple with myocytes by expressing either the connexins-43 (Cx43)\nor \nCx45~\\cite{rook:1992,camelliti:2004,chilton:2007,zlochiver:2008,miragoli:2006}.\nZlochiver, \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{zlochiver:2008} have shown the\nexpression of Cx43  between fibroblasts and myocytes in a\nmonolayer of myocytes and fibroblasts of neonatal rats; Miragoli,\n\\textit{et al.}~\\cite{miragoli:2006} have reported that Cx43 and\nCx45 are expressed among fibroblasts and between fibroblasts and\nmyocytes in cultured fibroblasts coated over\nrat-ventricular-myocyte strands. Both experimental and\ncomputational studies have shown that such coupling between\nmyocytes and fibroblasts enhances electrical-signal propagation\nin cardiac\ntissue~\\cite{zlochiver:2008,mcspadden:2009,miragoli:2006,xie:2009,nayak:2013};\nthis enhancement increases with $N_f$, the number of fibroblasts\nthat are attached to a myocyte. In cell-culture experiments,\nMiragoli, \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{miragoli:2006} have found that\nthe conduction velocity (CV) decreases with an increase in the\ndensity of fibroblasts in cultured strands of neonatal-rat\nmyocytes coated by fibroblasts; studies by McSpadden, \\textit{et\nal.}~\\cite{mcspadden:2009} have found that CV decreases as the\nfibroblast number increases on the top of a myocyte layer in a\nmonolayer of neonatal-rat cardiac myocytes, which are\nelectrotonically loaded with a layer of cardiac fibroblasts.\nZlochiver, \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{zlochiver:2008} have shown that\nCV decreases as (i) the gap-junctional conductance increases or\n(ii) the fibroblasts density increases in their experiments with\nfibroblasts of neonatal rats; they have also obtained similar\nresult in their computational studies in a two-dimensional (2D)\nsheet of myocyte tissue in the dynamic Luo-Rudy (LRd)\nmodel~\\cite{lr2a,lr2b} by \ninserting fibroblasts.  Computational studies by Xie, \\textit{et\nal.},~\\cite{xie:2009} have shown that CV decreases as they\nincrease the gap-junctional coupling or the fibroblasts density\nin a 2D LR1 myocyte model~\\cite{lr1}, with either randomly attached or\nrandomly inserted fibroblasts. In simulations with the 2D TNNP04\nmodel (due to ten Tusscher, \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{tnnp04}), Nayak,\n\\textit{et al.}~\\cite{nayak:2013} have found that CV either\ndecreases or increases, with attached fibroblasts, as they\nincrease the gap-junctional coupling. The experimental and\ncomputational investigations mentioned above show that both the\ngap-junctional coupling and $N_f$ enhance CV and, therefore, they\ncan play a crucial role in spiral- and scroll-wave dynamics in\nmathematical models for cardiac tissue.\n\nWe develop and investigate two models with different arrangements\nof fibroblasts that are attached to myocytes. In the first\narrangement there is a regular, spatially periodic attachment of\nfibroblast, whereas, in the second arrangement, fibroblasts are\nattached randomly to myocytes.  Our study has been designed to\nunderstand the effects of fibroblast organization, fibroblast\ndensity, and the myocyte-fibroblast coupling on spiral- and\nscroll-wave dynamics.  We use two parameter sets for myocytes.\nThe first set leads to a stable rotating spiral or scroll (RS)\nwave; the second leads to spiral- or scroll-wave-turbulence (ST)\nstates in an isolated myocyte domain. By investigating an ST state\nin the presence of fibroblasts, we observe that both models, with\nregularly and randomly attached fibroblasts, show transitions\nfrom an ST to an RS state, depending on the myocyte-fibroblast\ncoupling $G_j$ and the maximum number $N_f$ of fibroblasts\nattached to a myocyte in our simulation domain.  We find that,\nonce ST is converted to RS, the spiral or scroll rotation period\nincreases as we increase $G_j$ and $N_f$. Our study with an RS\nstate and fibroblasts shows that an RS remains unchanged in both\nmodels with regularly and randomly attached fibroblast; and the\nrotation period increases as we increase $G_j$ and $N_f$.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.\nSection~\\ref{modelmethod} is devoted to a description of our\nmodel and the numerical methods we use. Section~\\ref{result} is\ndevoted to our results.  Section~\\ref{conclusion} contains a\ndiscussion of the significance of our results.\n\n\\section{Model and Methods}\n\\label{modelmethod}\n\nIn this Section, we describe the details of our\nmyocyte-fibroblast models for two-dimensional (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) tissue. We also explain the\nnumerical-simulation techniques that we use to solve the partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) that comprise our mathematical\nmodels. We also discuss the methods that we use to analyze the\ndata from our numerical simulations.\n\n\\subsection{Model}\n\\label{model}\n\nThe 2D and 3D myocyte domains, with attached fibroblasts, can be\nmodeled by the following PDEs and ordinary-differential-equations\n(ODEs)~\\cite{keener:1998,panfilov:1997}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:pde} \t\n\\frac{\\partial V_m}{\\partial t} &=& \\frac{-I_m + N_f(\\mathbf{x})I_j}{C_m} + D\n\\nabla^2 V_m,\\\\\n\\label{eq:ode} \t\n\\frac{\\partial V_f}{\\partial t} &=& \\frac{-I_f - I_j}{C_f},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\tI_j=G_j(V_f-V_m);\n\\end{eqnarray}\nhere $C_m$ is the total cellular capacitance of a myocyte, $V_m$\nis the myocyte transmembrane potential, i.e., the voltage\ndifference between intra- and extra-cellular spaces, and $I_m$ is\nthe sum of all the ionic currents that cross the myocyte cell\nmembrane; $C_f$, $V_f$, and $I_f$ are, respectively, the total\ncellular capacitance, the transmembrane potential, and the sum of\nall ionic currents for the fibroblast; $N_f(\\mathbf{x})$ is the\nnumber of identical fibroblasts attached to a myocyte in our\nsimulation domain at the point $\\mathbf{x}$; and $I_j$, $G_j$,\nand $D$ are, respectively, the gap-junctional current, the\nmyocyte-fibroblasts gap-junctional conductance, and the diffusion\ncoefficient that is related to the gap-junctional conductance\nbetween myocytes.\n\nFor myocytes, we use the state-of-the-art mathematical model for\nhuman ventricular tissue developed by ten Tusscher and Panfilov\n(the TP06 model)~\\cite{tp06}.  In the TP06 model the total ionic\ncurrent is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nI_m &=& I_{Na} + I_{CaL} + I_{to} + I_{Ks} + I_{Kr} + I_{K1}   \\\\ \\nonumber\n         & & + I_{NaCa} + I_{NaK} + I_{pCa} + I_{pK} + I_{bNa} + I_{bCa},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $I_{Na}$ is the fast, inward ${Na^+}$ current, $I_{CaL}$\nthe L-type, slow, inward $Ca^{2+}$ current, $I_{to}$ the\ntransient, outward current, $I_{Ks}$ the slow, delayed, rectifier\ncurrent, $I_{Kr}$ the rapid, delayed, rectifier current, $I_{K1}$\nthe inward, rectifier ${K^+}$ current, $I_{NaCa}$ the\n${Na^+}/{Ca^{2+}}$ exchanger current, $I_{NaK}$ the\n${Na^+}/{K^+}$ pump current, $I_{pCa}$ and $I_{pK}$ the plateau\n$Ca^{2+}$ and $K^+$ currents, and $I_{bNa}$ and $I_{bCa}$ the\nbackground $Na^+$ and $Ca^{2+}$ currents, respectively. The full\nsets of equations for this model, including the ODEs for the\nion-channel gating variables and the ion dynamics, are given in\nRefs.~\\cite{nayak:2013,thesis:alok}.\n\nWe follow MacCannell, \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{maccannell:2007} to\nmodel the fibroblasts as passive elements.
