The linear analysis\n is done by utilizing a Green's function formulation to\n resolve the critical layers of the associated normal-mode problem.  We report\n several results: The instability is the result of a resonant interaction between\n a Rossby wave and a gravity wave.  The associated critical layer is\n the location where the Doppler shifted\n frequency of a distant Rossby wave equals the local \n {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency.  In the shear flow model, parameter value sweeps are done to determine \n when unstable Z-modes exist both separately of and in conjunction with\n the Rossby wave instability. The minimum required Rossby number\n for instability,\n $\\mathtt{Ro}= 0.2$, is confirmed for parameter values previously\n examined in the literature.  It is also found that the shear layer supports\n the instability in the limit where stratification vanishes.  The zombie vortex instability\n as well as the Rossby wave instability\n are examined for the first time in a jet model, finding that the instability\n can occur for $\\mathtt{Ro}= 0.05$.  \n For all model flows considered, nonlinear vorticity forcing\n due to unstable Z-modes is shown to result in the creation of a jet flow at the critical\n layer.  The jet-flow emerges as the result of the competition between \n the vertical lifting of perturbation radial vorticity and the radial transport\n of vertical perturbation vorticity wherein the former mechanism usually dominates\n the latter.  We find that the picture of this instability leading \n to a form of nonlinearly driven self-replicating/self-reproducing pattern of creation\n and destruction is warranted: parent jets\n spawn and grow child jets at associated critical layers and once the\n child jet grows strong enough it subsequently creates a next\n generation of jets associated with its critical layer while simultaneously\n destroying itself\n due to the Rossby wave instability.  We conclude with some speculation.}\n \n  \\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{Hydrodynamics, Astrophysical Disks -- theory, instabilities}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n{ \nThe last few years have enjoyed a revival in the study of non-magnetic routes to turbulence\nin protoplanetary disks.  \nMostly with the aid of high resolution numerical investigations,\nseveral new instability mechanisms and processes have been identified \nand shown to lead\nto some kind of sustained turbulent activity, including (but not limited to),\nthe baroclinic instability (Klahr \\& Bodenheimer, 2003, Petersen et al. 2007a,2007b,\nLesur \\& Papaloizou, 2010, \nLyra \\& Klahr, 2011,\nKlahr \\& Hubbard, 2014, Lyra 2014\n)\nthe Vertical Shear instability (Goldreich \\& Schubert, 1967, Fricke, 1968, \n Brandenberg and Urpin 1998, Urpin 2003, Nelson et al. 2013, Stoll \\& Kley 2014, VSI hereafter),\nand recently the self-replicating ``zombie vortex\" instability (Marcus et al. 2013, Marcus et al. 2015).\nThis study is aimed at developing deeper intuition of the linear instability associated\nwith the self-reproducing zombie mode instability (ZMI hereafter) \nexamined in Marcus et al. (2013, M13 hereafter).\n\\par\nM13 uncover the ZMI via numerical simulations in a stably stratified rotating Cartesian box model \nknown as the shearing box (Goldreich \\& Lynden-Bell, 1965).\nThe model is composed of a\nvertical component of uniform gravity and a basic, vertically uniform,\nKeplerian (azimuthal) flow field varying linearly with respect to the (nominal) radial box\ncoordinate.\n\n\n\n\nM13 consider the physical response\nof an azimuthally-aligned and relatively thin ``tube\"  of surplus vertical vorticity\ninitiated in the center of the box.\n\n\nThe tubular vortex responds to perturbations by radiating internal gravity waves which\nbecome resonant with distant buoyant critical layers.  \nThe resonant interaction at the critical layer is unstable and\nresults in the generation of \njet flows similarly oriented with the original tubular field.  \nThese ``child\" jets are\nfound in planes parallel to \nthe mid-plane containing the original ``parent\" tubular surplus field. \\par \nM13 show that the original parent vorticity field used\nto showcase this process remains stable and constituted\nduring the growth and maturation of the children.  \nTypically, the vorticity\nof the child jet grows in magnitude until it triggers\na secondary roll-up type of instability and then gets destroyed.\nBefore these first generation of jets are destroyed, however, \nthey have enough time to\nspawn a second generation of jets through the same resonant critical layer\ninteraction that brought\nthe first generation into existence.  \nThe numerical experiments in M13 illustrate \na self-reproducing process enveloping the\ndomain, essentially \n ``crystallizing\" it by leaving behind a lattice pattern of dynamically active\n regions of concentrated\n vertical vorticity undergoing cycles of creation and destruction. \n The final result resembles a sustained turbulent state.\n }\n  \\par\n If this self-replicating process holds up to independent scrutiny, its consequences\n are profound as far as planet formation is concerned\n because such a resulting flow state has important implications with regards to dust accumulation \n in protoplanetary disk, magnetic-Dead-Zones of protoplanetary disks (Turner, et al., 2014). \n For example, a scenario often quoted is one in which steady anticylonic\n vortices can attract particles over time.  But if this instability is active, while creating\n vortices it also destroys them and thereby disrupting the envisioned process of steady particle\n concentration.\n The consequence of this would be especially felt during the early stages of cold disk evolution.\n Equally important is that triggering this dynamical process requires a minimum source of perturbation\n vorticity (see also Marcus et al. 2015).  \n Identification\n of this Z-mode self-replicating process in numerical experiments necessitates high resolution\n studies because the dynamical activity is concentrated in a narrow region\n centered on the critical layers wherein the region's size depends linearly on\n the growth rate.\n A similar demand on resolution is needed \n for the VSI, but for entirely different reasons \n (Nelson et al. 2013, Stoll \\& Kley 2014, Barker \\& Latter, 2015, Umurhan et al., 2015, \n Richard et al., 2015).\n \\par\n \\medskip\n In this study we are interested in shedding some light on the mechanism of the linear instability\n associated with this phenomenon and, furthermore, developing some insight as to how the\n the critical layer instability leads to the creation of jets.\n The linear stability analysis of this relatively simplified shearing box setting is a\n notoriously difficult problem even in the case where there is only a purely\n Keplerian flow with no other additional vorticity surplus (e.g., Dubrulle et al. 2005). \n A normal mode reduction of this stripped-down linearized system produces a second order differential\n equation with irregular singular points and makes generating solutions, both \n analytically and numerically, extremely delicate and subtle.  The challenges are more\n compounded if one attempts to linearly study the same system with the addition\n of the surplus vertical vorticity field considered by M13 which varies\n both radially and vertically. In this setting, the linear stability problem becomes\n inseparable in both the radial and vertical coordinates, thereby amplifying the\n challenges faced by the analyst.\\footnote{This is also a feature of the VSI; see the discussion in\n Barker \\& Latter (2015) and Umurhan et al. (2015).}\n \\par\n Instead, we consider the linear normal mode response in the stably stratified shearing\n box containing {\\emph{a vertically uniform}} surplus vertical vorticity field -- either as a vorticity\n step located at the origin, or a vertically uniform shear layer, or a vertically uniform deviation \n jet flow (see Figure \\ref{Velocity_profiles}). \n { By being vertically uniform, these flows are often referred to as ``barotropic\".}\n  These test models are chosen because of analytical\n and numerical tractability.\n   While these model flow profiles are \n different than what was considered in M13, we find that the linear\n dynamical properties of these flow profiles are qualitatively similar to the processes\n involved in the self-reproducing mechanism reported in M13.  \n We find: \n \\begin{enumerate}\n \\item  The ZMI is characterized\n primarily as the near resonance between\n  the \n  Doppler shifted frequency of the Rossby wave associated with the\n  distant surplus vorticity field and the\n  Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency at the buoyant critical layer. \n  Without the Rossby wave the buoyant critical layer is not excited.  \n  \\item  The nonlinear outcome of the linear instability is to\n  drive into existence a jet-like vertical vorticity field at the critical layer(s). \n  \\item\n  The primary mechanism that spawns the jet flow is the vertical tilting of\n  {{perturbation radial vorticity}} although the radial transport of\n  perturbation vertical vorticity can also be important in magnitude\n  depending upon the type of shear flow under consideration.\n  \\item Model jet flows support both the ZMI\n  and the familiar\n  Rossby wave instability (Lovelace et al. 1999, Li et al. 2000, \n   Li et al. 2001, Meheut et al. 2010, Umurhan 2010, Meheut et al. 2012,\n  RWI hereafter), the latter of which induces\n  nonlinear roll-up of the anticyclonic part of the jet.  \n    \\item When the amplitude of the jet's vorticity exceeds a minimum value, \n    the jet gets destroyed by the RWI.  In the Keplerian flow\n  frame, the anti-cyclonic side of the jet experiences destructive roll-up\n  into coherent vortices.\n  \\item \n  Depending upon the base flow field considered,\n  the analysis indicates\n  that the self-replicating ZMI can be active for surplus vorticity fields whose Rossby numbers\n  are as small as 0.05 -- a figure which is smaller than previously anticipated by about\n  a factor of four.  \n  \\end{enumerate}\n  \\par\n  This study is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the shearing box equations assumed\n  for this analysis, including the scalings leading to them\n  and other assumptions and simplifications.  \n  The exact nonlinear form of the vertical vorticity\n  evolution equation is also shown.\n  In Section 3 the linearized equations of motion are derived, assuming\n  a (generalized) vertically uniform surplus vertical vorticity field.  After\n  stating our assumptions,  it is shown how\n  the equations of motion can be written either as a set of coupled integral equations\n  or as a second order differential equation in the radial coordinate of the shearing box. \n  The system is further decomposed into a potential vorticity formulation which identifies the main\n  wave mode involved in the ZMI later explored.\n  Section 4 presents the model surplus vorticity fields to be tested in our analysis: the \n  vorticity step and the asymmetric jet.  Section 5 details the relevant length and time scales in the problem and identifies the independent parameters of the problem depending upon which profile is considered.\n  Section 6 discusses the general solution method implemented.  Because of the aforementioned\n  difficulties inherent to solutions of differential operators with explicitly appearing, non-removable, irregular\n   singular points, we opt for solving the coupled integro-differential equations developed\n   in Section 3.  \n   \n   \n   \\par\n   Section 7 concentrates on the normal mode results for the three model shear flows considered.  \n   We detail the properties of the Zombie mode instability (herein termed Z-modes) in the \n   simple vortex step profile.  We also show how the asymmetric jet profile also supports\n   both the Z-mode instability and the RWI (the latter detailed in Appendix B).  \n   For the latter, we analytically develop\n   growth rates and conditions for marginality.  \n   Section 8 examines the nonlinear forcing implied by an unstable Z-mode.  We explicitly demonstrate\n   how it drives into existence a jet flow at the location of the critical layer.\n   Section 9 summarizes our main results and interprets the self-replicating dynamical \n   process of jet creation/destruction\n   in terms of the physical results garnered by the examination peformed\n   in this study.\n  \n\n\n\n\\section{Equations}\nFollowing M13, we consider dynamics in the so-called shearing box which\nrepresents dynamics in the frame of a Cartesian ``box\"-section\nof an accretion disk which rotates around the central star at a \ndistance of $R_0$ with\na rotation rate $\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$ and corresponding rotation vector given by ${\\bf \\hat z} \\Omega{_{_{0}}}$,\n(see Goldreich \\& Lynden-Bell, 1965) which is aligned with the disk vertical direction.\nWe take the equivalent radial direction to be along ${\\bf {\\hat x}}$\nand  the disk's azimuthal direction vector as ${\\bf {\\hat y}}$.\nLength scales in the box are in units of the local vertical scale height\n$H_0$.  The box equations are considered valid because the ratio\n$H_0/R_0$ is generally small for cold accretion disks.\nWe make the additional assumption\nof a Boussinesq fluid and, thereby, suppressing acoustic modes.  \nThe equations of motion are therefore\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n(\\partial_t + u\\partial_x + v\\partial_y + w\\partial_z) u  \n-2\\Omega{_{_{0}}} v &=& -\\partial_x \\Pi + 3\\Omega{_{_{0}}}^2 x,\n\\label{full_x_momentum}\n\\\\\n(\\partial_t + u\\partial_x + v\\partial_y + w\\partial_z) v + \n2\\Omega{_{_{0}}} u &=& -\\partial_y \\Pi, \n\\label{full_y_momentum}\n\\\\\n(\\partial_t + u\\partial_x + v\\partial_y + w\\partial_z) w\n &=& -\\partial_z \\Pi + g\\Theta, \n \\label{full_z_momentum}\n \\\\\n (\\partial_t + u\\partial_x + v\\partial_y + w\\partial_z) \\Theta\n +\\beta w \\Theta\n &=& 0, \n \\label{full_Theta}\n \\\\\n\\partial_x u + \\partial_y v + \\partial_z w &=& 0.\n\\label{full_incompressibility}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe quantities $u,v,w$ denote the components of velocity in \nthe radial, azimuthal and vertical directions respectively.\nIn the shearing box, the $u,v$ and $w$ velocity components are\nscaled by the local sound speed and this is possible only because\nthe box equations are for dynamics in a frame moving with the exceedingly faster\nKeplerian velocity.  \nTo facilitate comparison with the results of M13,\nwe make the similar assumption that is made in that study\nwherein the vertical component of\nthe disk gravitational field $g$ is taken to be a constant.\n\\par\nThe quantity $\\Theta$ can be interchangeably interpreted as either an entropy\nor a buoyancy; for this analysis we consider it as the latter, in which case\n$\\Theta$ is a non-dimensional quantity by definition. \nEquation (\\ref{full_z_momentum}) says the entropy/buoyancy field is passively\nadvected by the total flow with no sources or sinks meaning to say\nthat the perturbations are adiabatic.  Implicitly, we\nare saying that the actual cooling times of the protoplanetary disk gas \nis much longer than the growth rates\ncalculated later on. \n\\footnote{This is in contrast with the conditions giving rise to the VSI which\nrequires cooling times to be very short compared to both the local rotation\ntime of the disk and the associated growth rates.  See recent discussion in Lin \\& Youdin (2015).}\nBecause we are in the \nBoussinesq approximation, the pressure field $p$ is rewritten in\nterms of the quantity $\\Pi \\equiv p/\\rho_0$, as the density\n$\\rho_0$ is taken to be a constant in the mean state.\nThe quantity $\\beta$, which is in units of inverse length, \nrepresents the vertical gradient of\nthe disk buoyancy (itself a dimensionless quantity) and\nas with $g$ above, we assume it is constant.\nAs taken here, $\\beta > 0$ means\nthat it is buoyantly stable and the model is stably stratified against buoyant\ninstabilities.\n\\par\nIn deriving the box equations, there is always a component\nrepresenting the radial gradient of the gravitational potential of\nthe central star, and this appears in the form\nof the expression $ 3\\Omega{_{_{0}}}^2 x$ found on the right hand side\nof the $x$-momentum equation.

For the work presented here there are three kinds of flow profiles (Figure \\ref{Velocity_profiles})  examined which are \nfrequently identified by the number of ``jumps\" occurring in the mean vorticity field of the flow:\\par\n\\bigskip\n\\noindent\n\\emph{The vorticity step.}\nThis single vorticity jump profile (Figure \\ref{Velocity_profiles}a) , and its derivatives, are given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n& & V{_{_{0}}} = \\omega{_{_{a}}} \\epsilon \\ln\\left[\\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right],\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& & V{_{_{{0x}}}} = \\omega{_{_{a}}}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right),\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& & V{_{_{{0xx}}}} = \\frac{\\omega{_{_{a}}}}{\\epsilon}{\\rm sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right).\n\\label{step_profile}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe model profile is governed by two parameters, $\\omega{_{_{a}}}$ (units of inverse time) and \n$\\epsilon$ (units of length). The latter quantity controls how sharply the shear transition occurs \n(around $x$) while the former dictates the shear profile for values of $|x|\\gg \\epsilon$, i.e. $V{_{_{0}}} \\approx \\omega{_{_{a}}} |x|$ and $V{_{_{{0x}}}} \\approx \\omega{_{_{a}}} {\\rm sgn}(x)$ as $x\\rightarrow \\pm\\infty$.  \nThe useful feature of this type of model (and for the others described hereafter) is that as $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$ the profile \nresembles a piecewise linear velocity field.

In terms of the shearing box equations utilized in this work, the {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency ($\\sqrt{g\\beta}$) is an independent time scale appearing in the system.  The addition of the flow fields $V{_{_{0}}}$, discussed in Section\n \\ref{shear_profile_choices}, introduces additional timescales:\n$1/\\omega{_{_{a}}}$ associated with the vorticity step flow and shear layer models or, the two timescales $1/\\omega{_{_{a}}}^{\\pm}$ for\nthe jet flow model.\n\\par\nHad we chosen to do so, the governing equations\n(like, for example, equation \\ref{Single_2nd_Order_ODE_in_Pi})\n would have been non-dimensionalized according to $\\epsilon$ (spatial scales)\nand $\\Omega{_{_{0}}}^{-1}$ (temporal scales).

No normal modes are\nexpected since the radial extent of the system is\ninfinite and, as such, is unable to support a ``global\" supported mode.\nNormal modes are potentially possible only if other boundary conditions\nare adopted (not done here).  Of course, as an initial value problem with a given\ninitial disturbance, this system would respond by shedding inertia-gravity waves which\nare non-normal mode solutions of (\\ref{linearized_alternate_Xi}--\\ref{linearized_alternate_D}).\nThese waves would propagate\nout to $x\\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$, but they do not qualify as normal modes in this case.\n\\par\n\\medskip\nNormal modes do exist for $V{_{_{0}}} (x) \\neq 0$.  In this case, there \nare two kinds of modes supported which we henceforth refer to\nas ``Rossby modes\"(R-modes) and ``zombie modes\" (Z-modes).  The R-modes\nare the three-dimensional continuation of the classical\ntwo-dimensional shear modes examined in the literature\n(e.g. the Rayleigh shear layer, the RWI,the triangular jet,  etc.).  R-modes\nare unstable when two or more Rossby waves\n(sometimes known as ``Rossby edge waves\"), \neach being associated with local extrema in the radial vorticity gradient\nof the basic shear flow,\nbecome resonantly phase-locked due to their mutual interaction, i.e., the\ncounter propagating Rossby wave mechanism \\citep{1994JFM...276..327B,1999QJRMS.125.2835H,\n2010A&A...521A..25U}.   \nThere are no unstable R-modes in the single vorticity step flow\nfield because it can support only a single Rossby wave precluding the possibility\nof resonant wave-wave interaction. \n\\par\nOn the other hand, the Z-modes are different from the R-modes in that instability\nin these modes involves the resonant interaction between a single Rossby wave\nand a buoyant critical layer(s) nearby.    \nIn the following subsections we examine the properties of Z-modes\nfor the three model shear flows.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{perturbation_velocities_omega_0p42.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Like the previous figure but showing the fields (a) $u'$, (b) $v'$,(b) $w'$ and (d) $\\Pi'$.

Of course, as an initial value problem with a given\ninitial disturbance, this system would respond by shedding inertia-gravity waves which\nare non-normal mode solutions of (\\ref{linearized_alternate_Xi}--\\ref{linearized_alternate_D}).\nThese waves would propagate\nout to $x\\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$, but they do not qualify as normal modes in this case.\n\\par\n\\medskip\nNormal modes do exist for $V{_{_{0}}} (x) \\neq 0$.  In this case, there \nare two kinds of modes supported which we henceforth refer to\nas ``Rossby modes\"(R-modes) and ``zombie modes\" (Z-modes).  The R-modes\nare the three-dimensional continuation of the classical\ntwo-dimensional shear modes examined in the literature\n(e.g. the Rayleigh shear layer, the RWI,the triangular jet,  etc.).  R-modes\nare unstable when two or more Rossby waves\n(sometimes known as ``Rossby edge waves\"), \neach being associated with local extrema in the radial vorticity gradient\nof the basic shear flow,\nbecome resonantly phase-locked due to their mutual interaction, i.e., the\ncounter propagating Rossby wave mechanism \\citep{1994JFM...276..327B,1999QJRMS.125.2835H,\n2010A&A...521A..25U}.   \nThere are no unstable R-modes in the single vorticity step flow\nfield because it can support only a single Rossby wave precluding the possibility\nof resonant wave-wave interaction. \n\\par\nOn the other hand, the Z-modes are different from the R-modes in that instability\nin these modes involves the resonant interaction between a single Rossby wave\nand a buoyant critical layer(s) nearby.    \nIn the following subsections we examine the properties of Z-modes\nfor the three model shear flows.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{perturbation_velocities_omega_0p42.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Like the previous figure but showing the fields (a) $u'$, (b) $v'$,(b) $w'$ and (d) $\\Pi'$.

The core of the wave is localized around $x=0$ as this is the location\nwhere the radial gradient of the basic state shear profile is the greatest.\nIn the limit where $m\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$, together with $m \\ll \\alpha,$\nthis disturbance can be thought of as a vertically uniform azimuthally propagating edge wave \nand it was demonstrated in Umurhan (2010) to have a real frequency \ngiven by $\\omega = \\omega_a$ in the effective limit $\\alpha\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$\n($\\alpha$ fixed, $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$).  The frequency\nresponse of the unstable modes reported here are very nearly equal to this value, i.e.\nRe$(\\omega) \\approx \\omega_a$ - and this is especially true for modes with values of $m \\le 2$ (see Figure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_1j}).  \n{\\emph{We consider this Rossby edge wave to be the basic carrier mode of the\ninstability associated with Z-modes.}}\n\n\n\n\n\\par\nWith this insight, we can  predict the approximate locations of the various\ncritical layers in the limit where both $m$ is relatively small and \n$\\epsilon \\ll 1$.\\footnote{We also note that in this sense we\nconsider $\\epsilon$ to be sufficiently small if its value is below\nany numerically resolvable grid scale length.}  For the classical\nshear critical layer we have  $ \\alpha v{_{_{{0}}}}(x{_{_{{pp}}}}) - {\\rm Re}(\\omega) = 0$,\nwhich after a little manipulation becomes\n\n", "index": 53, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nx{_{_{{pp}}}}  \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\n\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac{\\omega{_{_{a}}}}\n{-{3\\Omega{_{_{0}}}}/{2} +  \n\\omega{_{_{a}}}{\\rm sgn}\\left(x{_{_{{pp}}}}\\right)}}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E18.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"x{{}_{{}_{{pp}}}}\\approx\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\\left({\\displaystyle\\frac%&#10;{\\omega{{}_{{}_{a}}}}{-{3\\Omega{{}_{{}_{0}}}}/{2}+\\omega{{}_{{}_{a}}}{\\rm sgn}%&#10;\\left(x{{}_{{}_{{pp}}}}\\right)}}\\right).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>x</mi><mmultiscripts><mo>\u2248</mo><mprescripts/><msub><mi/><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><none/></mmultiscripts><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>\u03b1</mi></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><msub><mi/><msub><mi/><mi>a</mi></msub></msub></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mmultiscripts><mo>/</mo><mprescripts/><msub><mi/><mn>0</mn></msub><none/></mmultiscripts><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi><mmultiscripts><mi>sgn</mi><mprescripts/><msub><mi/><mi>a</mi></msub><none/></mmultiscripts><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mmultiscripts><mo>)</mo><mprescripts/><msub><mi/><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><none/></mmultiscripts></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00382.tex", "nexttext": " \nThe above are rough guides -- in actuality the position of the critical\nlayers will differ from the above approximate form when \n$m \\gg 1$, since $\\omega$ of the Rossby wave is no longer expected\nto be given by $\\omega_a$.  \nNonetheless, when the correct value of Re$(\\omega)$ appropriate\nfor the given Rossby wave is input,  we obtain\nthe correct critical layer position as expected.\n\\par\n\n\nThe perturbation potential vorticity is displayed in Figure \\ref{Vorticity_profile_1j}.\nConsistent with our analysis of Section \\ref{alternative_form_of_equations}, \nwe see that  $\\Xi'$ has power purely in the region of $x=0$ and no\ndiscernible power in the regions around the critical points $x{_{_{{bg}}}}^\\pm$.\nThis is rationalized because the potential vorticity is (linearly) forced \nonly by the advection of the mean\nvorticity gradient which has appreciable power only around $x=0$. \nFor us, this observation lends further credence to our claim that the main\nperturbation structure is that of a Rossby wave and that it is this wave\nthat triggers the critical layers at $x{_{_{{bg}}}}^\\pm$.\n\\par\nIn Figure \\ref{General_profiles_1j} we show a fairly typical result\ninvolving unstable modes of the system.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three panels show the quantities $\\theta',\\zeta'$ and $D'$.\nThe vorticity shows strong power near $x=0$.

We consider horizontal wavenumber values\nof $\\alpha = 1.3$ which is approximately the smallest non-zero wavenumber \nappropriate for the numerical experiments of M13.\\par\nFigure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump} shows the growth rates for\nfour different values of $\\omega_a^+$ holding $\\Delta^+, \\delta$ and $\\alpha$ fixed.  \nThe results show that if the jet amplitude $\\omega_a^+$ lies between\n$0$ and $\\omega_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$ with  $\\omega_{a{{\\rm c1}}} \\approx -0.104\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$, then only a Z-mode instability is possible. This corresponds to a value of Ro slightly larger than 0.05.\nIn this case, there is no growth for $m=0$ and the fastest\ngrowing mode occurs for $m\\approx 3.5$\n-  which is similar to the periodic\npattern seen in the emerging crystallization profile of Figure 2d of M13.\nHowever right at $\\omega_a^+ = \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c}}}$ (the dashed curve \nin Figure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump})\nthe $m=0$ state also becomes marginal.  Coincidentally\nthis critical value of $\\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$ is approximately the same marginal condition\nfor the RWI and this is borne out by an inspection of the marginal boundary\nshown in Figure \\ref{Barotropic_Growth_rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}\n(see the location where the two hatched lines meet).  When \nthe magnitude of the jet's amplitude exceeds this marginal\nvalue, i.e. for $\\omega_a^+ < \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$, then the\nthe growth curves show growth also for vertically uniform perturbations indicating\nthe concurrence of the Z-mode instability and the RWI.  The Z-mode instability\nis clearly evident as the maximum growth rate still sits around the $m\\approx 3.5$\nvalue, however, its presence is diminished by the growing importance of the RWI\nas the magnitude of  $\\omega_a^+$ increases well past the\ncorresponding magnitude of $\\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$ (see the solid curve in that same figure).\n\\par\n In conclusion we find that, irrespective of the sign of $\\omega^+_a$, \n an asymmetric jet profile can support both\n the  RWI and the Z-mode instability provided the jet's amplitude is sufficiently strong, in other\n words, jets are unstable and likely undergo nonlinear destructive transformation\n if $|\\omega^\\pm_a|$ is large enough.

The pattern of the\nsolutions indicate similarity to the single pressure extremum case analyzed in \nUmurhan (2010). For the case where $-0.5\\Omega{_{_{0}}} < \\omega_a^+ < 1.5\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$ is a maximum value of $\\alpha\\Delta^+\n\\approx 0.53$\nbeyond which there is no instability.  As $\\alpha\\Delta^+ \\rightarrow 0$ the critical value of $\\omega_a^+$ for instability\nalso approaches zero which essentially means that all values of $\\omega_a^+$, positive or negative, have some potential\nfor instability so long as the jet widths are thin enough.  This latter property differs from the analogous\nproperty in the classical RWI problem wherein only anticylonic values of the deviation shear profile (i.e. $\\omega_a < 0$)\nlead to instability.\nFinally, for a given value of $\\omega_a^+$ there always exists a wavenumber corresponding to the fastest\ngrowth rate indicated by a perusal of the contours shown in Figure \\ref{Barotropic_Growth_rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}.\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{asymmetric_jet_growth_rates_1.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Growth rates (in units of $\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$) in asymmetric jet model with $\\epsilon = 0.02$,\n$g\\beta = 4\\Omega{_{_{0}}}^2$,\n$\\Delta^+ = 0.13$, $\\Delta^- = 0.20$ (i.e. $\\delta \\approx 1.54$), \nand $\\alpha = 1.3$\nfor four different values of \n$\\omega_a^+$ with $\\omega_a^-$ fixed and equal to\n$-\\omega_a^+\\Delta^+/\\Delta^-$\n\n\n\n\n(values of $\\omega_a^+$ in units of $\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$).  \nThe dashed curve\nsignifies the critical value of $\\omega_a^+$ in which\nthe RWI begins to also get expressed\n(and corresponds to the critical\ncriterion indicated by where the two hatched lines meet in Figure \\ref{Barotropic_Growth_rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}).  \n\n\n\nIn all\ncurves shown, the fastest growth rate corresponds to $m\\approx 3.5$.\n\n\n\n\n}\n\\label{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsubsection{\\emph{Z-modes}}\\label{zmodes_asymmetric_jet}\nAs might be anticipated, the asymmetric jet model also supports Z-mode instability.\nA representative survey of the results is found in the growth rates as a function\nof vertical wavenumber shown in Figure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}.\nAs in the last section, the asymmetric models are ones in which the total integrated\ndeviation vorticity is zero, so that the flow profile is dictated only by values\nof $\\omega_a^+, \\Delta^+, \\Delta^-/\\Delta^+ = \\delta$ with $\\omega_a^-$ given\nby (\\ref{restricted_omega_minus}).  We consider horizontal wavenumber values\nof $\\alpha = 1.3$ which is approximately the smallest non-zero wavenumber \nappropriate for the numerical experiments of M13.\\par\nFigure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump} shows the growth rates for\nfour different values of $\\omega_a^+$ holding $\\Delta^+, \\delta$ and $\\alpha$ fixed.  \nThe results show that if the jet amplitude $\\omega_a^+$ lies between\n$0$ and $\\omega_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$ with  $\\omega_{a{{\\rm c1}}} \\approx -0.104\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$, then only a Z-mode instability is possible. This corresponds to a value of Ro slightly larger than 0.05.\nIn this case, there is no growth for $m=0$ and the fastest\ngrowing mode occurs for $m\\approx 3.5$\n-  which is similar to the periodic\npattern seen in the emerging crystallization profile of Figure 2d of M13.\nHowever right at $\\omega_a^+ = \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c}}}$ (the dashed curve \nin Figure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump})\nthe $m=0$ state also becomes marginal.  Coincidentally\nthis critical value of $\\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$ is approximately the same marginal condition\nfor the RWI and this is borne out by an inspection of the marginal boundary\nshown in Figure \\ref{Barotropic_Growth_rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}\n(see the location where the two hatched lines meet).  When \nthe magnitude of the jet's amplitude exceeds this marginal\nvalue, i.e. for $\\omega_a^+ < \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$, then the\nthe growth curves show growth also for vertically uniform perturbations indicating\nthe concurrence of the Z-mode instability and the RWI.  The Z-mode instability\nis clearly evident as the maximum growth rate still sits around the $m\\approx 3.5$\nvalue, however, its presence is diminished by the growing importance of the RWI\nas the magnitude of  $\\omega_a^+$ increases well past the\ncorresponding magnitude of $\\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$ (see the solid curve in that same figure).\n\\par\n In conclusion we find that, irrespective of the sign of $\\omega^+_a$, \n an asymmetric jet profile can support both\n the  RWI and the Z-mode instability provided the jet's amplitude is sufficiently strong, in other\n words, jets are unstable and likely undergo nonlinear destructive transformation\n if $|\\omega^\\pm_a|$ is large enough.

This\nis understood to represent the primary\nvortex step either rolling-up or undergoing a large amplitude undulation \n(e.g., Tamarin et al. 2015).  There is strong amplitude power in both\nthe mean-forcing and 2k-forcing \nat the critical point $x{_{_{{bg}}}}^+ \\approx 0.62$.\nThe vorticity forcing there is that of a jet (for comparison\nsee the vorticity profile\nassociated with the barotropic jet in Figure \\ref{Velocity_profiles}b), which \nmeans that as the Z-mode instability develops, there will nonlinearly emerge\na jet like structure in the critical layer.\\par\nWhat is unexpected is that the amplitude of this vorticity forcing at\n$x{_{_{{bg}}}}^+$ is driven primarily by the vortex tilting terms: perturbations\nin the velocity fields\ngive rise to perturbations in the horizontal vorticity components $\\zeta{_{_{x}}}',\\zeta{_{_{y}}}'$.\nThese, in turn, nonlinearly couple to the perturbation vertical velocity $w'$ -- in\nthe critical layer these nonlinear products act as source terms \ngenerating vertical vorticity.\n  The radial transport term also contributes significantly in the critical layer,\nbut generally acts opposite to the vorticity generation driven by the vertical tilting\nof horizontal vorticity.  In all instances we have calculated, the\naggregate vortex forcing is non-zero and always dominated by the vortex tilting terms, and mainly\nby the vertical tilting of the radial vorticity $\\zeta_x \\partial_x w$.  We also note that the vortical forcing\nat $x{_{_{{bg}}}}^-$ is comparatively weak although non-zero.  It is remarkable that\nthere is strong power in both the mean and 2k forcings indicating that this\ninstability is quite powerful where it is expressed since many vertical wave numbers\nare excited (see the discussion on growth rates and their dependence on the vertical wave number $m$,\nfound in the previous sections). \nIts expression, however, is constrained to within \na narrow zone of the critical layer whose\nwidth depends upon the growth rate itself: faster growth\nrates mean wider the critical\nlayer zones (see further below).\n\n\\par\n\\bigskip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{asymmetric_jet_lowvamp_forcing.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\nNonlinear vorticity forcing in the mean for the asymmetric jet profile with $\\alpha = 1.3$\n$\\Delta^+ = 0.13$, $\\Delta^- = 0.20$ and $\\omega_a^+ = -0.1 $ (with\n $\\omega_a^- = 0.065 $) and $g\\beta = 4$, the latter\n being comparable\n to conditions examined in M13. \n The model flow profile has an effective Ro $\\sim 0.05$ \n The vertical wavenumber $m = 3.52$ corresponding\nto the fastest growth rate (Im$(\\omega) \\approx 0.011$) \nof the dispersion curve associated with the diamonds shown\nin Figure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}.

We also note that the nonlinear vortical forcing upon the\n model jet is mainly in the region $0<x<0.2$. Given the value of $\\omega_a^+ \\approx -0.12\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$\n it means\n that {\\emph{the nonlinear driving is focused mainly on the anti-cyclonic side of the asymmetric jet}} suggesting\n that this will ultimately result in the nonlinear roll-up of that part of the jet - something\n that is seen throughout the numerical experiment reported in M13.\nEventually, when the value of $\\omega_a^+ $ is strongly in the RWI instability regime\n(i.e. $\\omega_a^+ < \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$)\nthe nonlinear forcing is almost entirely focused upon the anti-cyclonic side of the model\njet with relatively little corresponding forcing power at the critical layer zones\nor the cyclonic side of the jet (Figure \\ref{asymmetric_jet_highvamp_forcing}).\n\\par\nAlthough not shown here, the same qualitative pattern holds if $\\omega_a^+$ is sufficiently positive.\nFor example we have examined the results using the same model \njet dimensions assumed for the results shown in Figures \\ref{Vorticity_Forcing_lowvamp}--\\ref{asymmetric_jet_highvamp_forcing}\nincluding the value of $\\alpha\\Delta^+ \\approx 0.16$, $\\delta \\approx 1.54$ and $g\\beta = 4\\Omega{_{_{0}}}^2$ where, instead, we\nexamine the response for positive\nvalues of $\\omega_a^+$.  Inspection of\n Figure \\ref{Barotropic_Growth_rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}\n shows that the corresponding value of the onset of the RWI for the\n jet is given by $\\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c2}}} \\approx 0.22\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$.  The same pattern of results\n follows - for $0 < \\omega_a^+ < \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c2}}}$ only the Z-mode instability is expressed\n and the nonlinear vortical forcing is dominant in the critical layer zones.\n Similarly, as $\\omega_a^+  > \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c2}}}$ the RWI becomes more important in which\n the nonlinear vortical forcing is dominant in the vicinity of the model jet.\n In particular, the forcing is concentrated in the region $-0.2 < x < 0$ \n but this also happens to be the anti-cyclonic side of the model jet since $\\omega_a^+ > 0$  means\n $\\omega_a^- < 0$ according to equation (\\ref{restricted_omega_minus}).\n \\par\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=15cm]{asymmetric_jet_medvamp2_forcing.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Like Figure \\ref{Vorticity_Forcing_lowvamp} \nexcept $\\omega{_{_{a}}}^+ = -0.12$ (and $\\omega{_{_{a}}}^- = 0.078$), which\nmeans this is a model flow profile with Ro $\\sim 0.06$: (a)\ntop panel forcing in the mean and (b) forcing in 2k.

They find that after some time, the fluid domain\n steadily transitions into similarly confined narrow/tubular regions of deviation jet-like profiles.\n For a surplus vorticity field placed at the origin containing the midplane, the response flow\n generates jet like vertical vorticity above and below the mid plane at the location of buoyant critical points.\n A close inspection of both Figures 1 and 2 of that work shows that the generated jet-like vertical vorticity fields\n(the original children)  have\n some vertical extent.  As the simulation marches forward in time, these original child vortices \n themselves become parents to a new generation of\n child vortices at new critical layers associated with their parents, and so on the process\n continues.\\footnote{We observe that in the numerical experiment results presented in \n M13, the original tube of surplus vertical vorticity located at the origin remains constituted\n as such throughout the duration of the domain and does not get destroyed.  This is probably\n because the the width and girth of this line charge vorticity is one which does not\n go unstable via the RWI (or its equivalent analog for such a model flow).  Further analysis needs to be done to confirm this conjecture.}  \n The results and intuition derived from the linear study\n considered here largely confirms this self-replicating scenario\n proposed in M13. \\par\n The insights garnered of the analysis here helps to fill in more of the details of this\n emergent (possibly) turbulent self-sustaining process.  A vorticity field supporting a localized\n Rossby wave will generate a new vorticity field at a far-field buoyant critical layer.\n This buoyant critical layer $x_{bg}$ is found to be the location\n where the Doppler shifted frequency of the Rossby wave is resonant with the local\n Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency.  The resonance induces a vortex generation mechanism\n which is dominated by\n two mostly opposing processes: (i) the local creation of vertical vorticity \n in which the local  perturbation radial vorticity\n (i.e. the $\\zeta_x$ found in the region around $x=x_{bg}$)\n is converted into vertical vorticity through the vertical tilting process: \n $\\zeta_x \\partial_x w$, and (ii) the local (again near $x=x_{bg}$) radial advection of the \n perturbation vertical vorticity: $u'\\partial_x \\zeta$.  Both effects act nearly opposite to\n one another, but the vertical tilting mechanism appears to dominate in the jet profiles\n we have tested here in this study.\n \\par\n Among other things, this results in an asymmetric jet-like structure which\n grows in amplitude until it either saturates or the jet itself gets destroyed\n because of roll-up due to the RWI.   While the spawned jet grows it can, on its own\n accord, induce new jet-like structures at new critical points associated with the spawned jet\n and the linear analysis done here largely supports the picture sketched in M13 of {\\emph{jets begetting jets}}.\n As a ``parent\" structure, a jet-like profile can give rise to new ``child\" jets only \n while the parent jet maintains its structural integrity.  This can be inferred from the linear stability\n of the asymmetric jet examined in Section 6.3: as the amplitude of the jet $|\\omega_a^\\pm|$ is increased\n from zero\n first only Z-modes are unstable.  However, as $|\\omega_a^\\pm|$ increases eventually \n the most unstable mode is the RWI which induces transformative/destructive roll up of the\n parent jet.  \n It is only during the low amplitude range of jet amplitudes, prior to the RWI becoming\n important, will a given jet generate into existence a new jet(s) at its\n associated buoyant critical layer(s).\n \\par\n In this way, the parent jet must stay as such long enough for child jets to grow into maturity\n so they too can generate the next generation of jets, and so on perpetuating the\n  self-replication process.  Critical to this is the time spent\n growing each jet - as it must grow slow enough so that the Z-mode instability (which is relatively\n slow by our current account) may manifest itself and start\n spawning the next generation of jets.  If a jet grows too fast then the Z-mode process has no time\n to birth the new generation and the whole process shuts off.  If the jet grows quite slowly\n it could, in a general sense, give rise to a pattern state like that reported in M13.\n Conditions lying somewhere between these two extremes might give rise to a turbulent flow state that could be either\n decaying or self-sustaining\n - perhaps something in the flavor of a ``chaotic propeller\" \n  identified as being operative in subcritical transitions in both plane-Couette \n  and rotating-plane-Couette flows\n  (e.g., see discussion in Rincon et al. 2007). \n \\par\n   Whether or not this process can be self-sustaining and lead to a turbulent state\n   under a wide umbrella of conditions appropriate to Dead Zones\n remains to be determined.  It would seem, however given our considerations,\n that its self-sustainability depends centrally on what way the original disturbances are structured\n since it requires there to be some relatively large amplitude disturbance to start the whole thing off.\n A recent announcement by Marcus et al. (2015) on this process in a shearing sheet disk model with vertically varying gravity and \n stratification seems to indicate that it can give rise to a strongly turbulent state.\n \n \n  \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{2D_jet_rollup.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Two dimensional simulation of the RWI roll-up of the asymmetric\njet problem examined in Section \\ref{RWI_in_asymmetric_jet}\nwith $\\omega_a^+ = -0.2\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$, $\\omega_a^- = -0.13\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$\nwith $\\Delta^+ = 0.13$ and $\\Delta^- = 0.2$ and $\\epsilon = 1/50$.

The discussion\nin the previous section concerning\n the self-reproductive spatial spreading of jet creation/destruction\n is the expected outcome of the former of the two conditions.  What might happen\n when the critical layer appears inside the shear layer?  \n \\par Consider the nonlinear\n vorticity forcing arising from the conditions\n shown in Figure \\ref{omega_Z_Shear_Layer_solutions}b in which the critical layer\n is clearly inside the shear layer and the shear layer itself is stable against\n the destructive RWI.  We show in Figure \\ref{confined_transition} the corresponding \n mean vertical vorticity forcing profile\n arising under these parameter conditions\n $g\\beta < N_{{\\rm cr}}^2$.

We observe that unlike the examples of the\n vorticity-step and jet profiles, the critical layer jets are primarily\n driven by the radial advection of the perturbation vertical vorticity\n ($-u\\partial_x \\zeta$)\n  while\n the vertical tilting of radial perturbation vorticity\n ($\\zeta_x \\partial_x w$) is relatively weak by comparison but acts\n with the same sense as the radial advection of the perturbation vertical vorticity.\n \\par The implications are interesting: These results suggest that\n under those conditions in which the {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency is small,\n that jets will grow inside the shear layer and, as per our\nearlier insights, once the jet amplitude grows large enough it will self-destruct while\ngenerating new jets associated with its critical layers.  If the whole process remains\nconfined to inside the shear layer, then there are at least two possible outcomes:  In the first\nof these,\nthe parent shear layer structure remains stable \n(also as suggested by linear analysis) while the jet inside grows and once\nhaving reached a sufficient amplitude it will self-destruct having spawned child jets\nalong the way (presumably contained inside the shear layer as well).  The second possibility\nis that while the jet inside grows, the parent shear layer nonlinearly destructs as well.\nIf an external agent is responsible for the creation and maintenence of the parent shear layer in the first\nplace -- e.g, by either direct thermally driven relaxation (Les \\& Lin, 2015, Lobo Gomes et al., 2015)\nor by the VSI (Richard et al., 2015) -- \nthen either of the two scenarios envisioned could give rise to a process of \nunsteady jet creation and destruction entirely contained inside the shear layer, where the only\ndifference in the outcomes of the two possibilities is the degree of the unsteady activity -- possibly\nturbulent.  Global numerical calculations of the several processes mentioned (thermally driven\nrelaxation or the VSI), when sufficiently resolved,\ncan test whether or not this dynamical scenario indeed manifests itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{nonlinear_forcing_omega_SHEAR_LAYER_0p41.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The nonlinear vorticity driving for the linear solutions\nshown in Figure \\ref{omega_Z_Shear_Layer_solutions}b.

The relatively sophisticated\napproach, which involves converting the underlying linearized differential system instead into a set of coupled\nintegral equations, is here undertaken because\nof the complexities inherent to discerning eigenmode structure \nof PDEs supporting one or more irregular singular points.  In this problem,\nthose singular points are \nthe buoyant critical layers responsible for the instability.\n\\par\nThe single-step vorticity jump examined at length in Section\n\\ref{naked_Z-modes} exhibits the Z-mode instability stripped down\nto its bare minimum ingredients, that is, a stably stratified atmosphere\nwith a shear profile $v_0(x)$ containing (at least) one location with a strong\nradial gradient which, in turn, supports a radially localized Rossby wave which is the\nbasic carrier mode of the Z-mode instability.  Supposing\nthis Rossby wave is vertically uniform and has a wavelength $\\lambda_\\alpha = 2\\pi/\\alpha$ \nwith corresponding propagation\nspeed $c{_{_{{rw}}}}$,  \non its own accord it will not become unstable. However,\nbecause the atmosphere is stratified with a squared {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency $N^2{_{_{B}}} \\equiv g\\beta$, \nsufficiently far from the center of the Rossby wave there exist radial\nlocations $x{_{_{{bg}}}}^\\pm$ in which the location specific value of the background shear flow plus\nthe local {\\emph{vertically uniform}} inertia-gravity wave propagation speed\n$\\pm N{_{_{B}}}/\\alpha$ is equal to the Rossby propagation wave speed, \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 95563, "prevtext": "\nwhere the star appearing means complex conjugate.

The localization scales linearly with the growth rate of the Z-mode \n- a lower growth\nrates means a narrower critical layer zone.  \nThis trend is probably why many previous\nnumerical simulations (prior to M13),\nconducted both in shearing sheet and cylindrical geometries,\nhave been unable to \nsee any evidence of this effect. \\par\nWe have examined with some detail the conditions\nin which unstable Z-modes exist both independently of and concurrently with\nthe RWI in the shear-layer model.  Using conditions similar\nto that examined in M13 (namely, fixed horizontal box size and shear layer width) \nwe demonstrate for shear layers\nwhose amplitudes $\\omega{_{_{a}}}$ lie between $\\omega{_{_{Z}}} > \\omega{_{_{a}}} > \\omega{_{_{R}}}$\nthat Z-modes exist in the absence of the RWI.  The condition $\\omega{_{_{a}}} = \\omega{_{_{R}}}$\nis the condition for the onset of the RWI and for values of \n$\\omega{_{_{a}}} < \\omega{_{_{R}}}$ both instabilities are present.  \n $\\omega{_{_{Z}}}$, \nwhich is the critical value of the onset of Z-modes, \nis a function of the {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency $g\\beta$ and the former's\ndependence upon the latter\nwas numerically determined for the special\ncase considered and summarized in Figure \\ref{omega_Z_Shear_Layer}.\nIt is unexpected that the instability persists even in the limit\nwhere the stratification vanishes ($g\\beta \\rightarrow 0$) suggesting that plain\ninertial modes in the shearing sheet should also be unstable \nunder suitable conditions in the presence of any number\nof model flows like those considered here.  This remains to be further examined.\n\\par\nThe qualitative trends\nregarding the existence of Z-modes and their concurrence with the RWI\n reported above for the shear layer carry over to the jet flow model\nas well.  However, the same relatively\ndetailed analysis done for the shear layer model\nremains to be done for the jet flow model.\\par\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\par\n\\medskip\nGiven the calculated perturbation responses including the derived\nvelocity and vorticity fields,\none can assess the total nonlinear vertical vortex forcing arising from these modes\naccording to equation (\\ref{vortex_tilting}).  What is remarkable is that \nat the buoyant critical layer $x{_{_{{bg}}}}$ there are two main competitive effects driving \nthe nonlinear response, namely,\nthat of the radial transport of the perturbation vertical vorticity, $u'\\partial_x\\zeta'$,\nand the vertical tilting  \nof the perturbation {radial vorticity}, $\\zeta_x'\\partial_x w'$.\nFigure \\ref{nonlinear_vorticity_forcing_1j}, which\nserves as a representative depiction of these varied forcings,\nshows the vertical tilting of the radial perturbation vorticity generally\nwinning out over the radial advection of perturbation\nvertical vorticity and, ultimately, giving rise to a vertically/azimuthally uniform\njet flow as well as power in higher harmonics in \nthe azimuthal and vertical directions.  The emerging jet flow is strongly localized due to the\nsize of the original critical layer.  This resultant nonlinear forcing\nat the buoyant critical layers is the same for all three model flows examined\nhere.  \n\\par\nWe note that the only qualitative difference in the outcome of the instability\nin the critical layer is in the sign in the change of vorticity\nacross the central ridge line of the emerging jet, which\ndepends upon whether or not $u'\\partial_x\\zeta'$ \ndominates $\\zeta_x'\\partial_x w'$ inside the critical layer during the growth\nof the instability.  This is because these two forcing terms appear to act\nopposite to one another - at least this is so in all of the profiles we have\nexamined while preparing this study.\n\\par\nWe have also shown here\nthat both jets and shear layers are subject to the RWI if their vorticity\namplitudes get large enough.  We have considered this in detail for\nthe jet model flow where we find that as the amplitude of the jet approaches\nthe critical value needed for\nthe onset of the RWI, the nonlinear forcing upon itself increases\nas well (sequenced in Figures  \n\\ref{Vorticity_Forcing_lowvamp}--\\ref{asymmetric_jet_highvamp_forcing}).\nMoreover, this nonlinear self interaction, which is separate from\nthe nonlinear forcing occurring at the buoyant critical layers, \nis focused mainly on the anti-cyclonic side\n\\footnote{Recall that parts of the shear flow are\ntermed anti-cyclonic with respect to the background Keplerian shear flow.  See \ndiscussion formal definition of this found in Section 4.}\n of the jet which\nshould cause it to undergo a roll-up type of instability.\n\\par\n\nIndeed, the study of \\citet{Talia2015}\n explicitly examines how the $2k$-forcing\\footnote{as defined in Section 8.}\n of an unstable Rayleigh shear layer is most\nresponsible for the destructive transformation of the shear layer in the nonlinear regime.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure \\ref{2D_jet_rollup} depicts this\nfor a model two-dimensional simulation of an unstable jet \nof the kind examined in Section \\ref{RWI_in_asymmetric_jet}\n(numerical method details discussed in figure caption)\nshowing the nonlinear roll-up of\na jet profile subject to the RWI.\nOnly the anticyclonic part\nrolls up while the cylonic portion remains more or less intact.\nThe qualitative features of the roll-up sequence of the model asymmetric jet\nshown mirrors that of the\nsimulations snapshots shown in M13.  We emphasize that the\nnumerical experiment of the model jet shown in Figure \\ref{2D_jet_rollup} is two-dimensional and cannot\nrepresent the later generation of new jets at the model jet's associated buoyant critical layers.\nNonetheless, the point we wish to make is\nthe claim that this part of the process discussed in M13\ncan be understood independently within the framework of the RWI.\nA similar role of the RWI has been recently uncovered in the nonlinear development\nof the VSI (Richard et al., 2015).\n\\par\nThe totality of the aforementioned results leads one into considering\nthe possibility, as originally suggested in M13, that\nunder suitable conditions the nonlinear outcome of this instability\nis that of a self-replicating dynamical\nmechanism of jet creation and destruction.\nIf the circumstances are just right, this could result in widespread turbulence\nwhich could perhaps be sustained. \nA given parent jet flow\ncan bring into being, through the Z-mode instability, a first generation\nof child jets at the buoyant\ncritical layers of the parent.  Once the amplitude of the child jets grows\nlarge enough they, in turn, bring into existence a second generation of child\njets\nat the buoyant critical layers associated with the first generation, and so\non the process continues.  However, once the vorticity amplitudes of the first\ngeneration get large enough, the jets will experience the RWI destroying\nthe anticyclonic side of their flow profiles and, possibly, severely disrupting the orderly flow of\ntheir cyclonic sides as well.  \nA once quiet laminar disk can undergo a transformation into a non-steady\ndynamical state as the creation/destruction process described herein replicates\nitself and spreads over the entirety of the domain.\n\\par\nOf course, the robustness of the overall scenario described \nand its relevance\nto real protoplanetary disk Dead Zones remains to be assessed and should be the focus\nof future study.\nSuch an evaluation should\ncenter on the fact that the zombie vortex instability requires the presence of a large amplitude initial\ndisturbance (like the three model flows considered in this study) \nto set off the process in the first place.  How does such\na configuration come about in the first place would have to be plausibly\nexplained and somehow justified.   The recent numerical \nwork of \\citet{M15},\nwhich examines this process for a more realistic disk model in which, effectively\nspeaking with respect to our analysis, the {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency is\na function of the vertical coordinate,\nreports a similar pattern of eruption of the laminar state\nand subsequent transformation into an unsteady dynamical flow.  A\nparallel linear analysis like that done here but applied in the more \nphysically relevant\nsetting considered by Marcus et al. (2015) -- in which\nthe vertical gravity and stratification is coordinate dependent --\n is both challenging and awaits to be done.\n \\par\n \\medskip\n It appears that our conceptions regarding the nature and development of \n disk activity -- possibly even turbulent -- have returned to some ideas\n that were discussed nearly 25 years ago.  \n In an often overlooked study by Dubrulle \\& Knobloch (1992)\n the authors performed a careful analysis of a non-stratified shearing box \n and showed that all small amplitude disturbances\n are stable.  They went on to argue that a pure Keplerian\n flow is not enough to generate an instability and they went further\n to stress that some other\n additional {\\emph{finite}} amplitude profile -- which possesses at least\n one inflection point -- would be necessary to instigate some kind\n of turbulent transition in a (non-magnetized) disk.  \n Two previous studies done right prior\n to that work, namely by Lerner \\& Knobloch (1988) and\n Dubrulle \\& Zahn (1991), explicitly demonstrated that instability\n was feasible in a plane-Couette setting\n with a flow profile similar to the shear layer profile\n examined in this work. \n Indeed, one can argue that the RWI is an example of such an inflection point\n instability since the shearing\n box is the rotating version of classical plane-Couette flow\n and the flow profiles examined in the original study of \n Lovelace et al. (1999) contain at least one inflection point.\n  We see the Zombie vortex discovery by M13 and Marcus et al. (2015)\n -- as well as the linear analysis we have conducted here -- as taking the\n vision expounded by Dubrulle \\& Knobloch (1992)\n one step further for a stratified shearing box:  \n that a finite amplitude profile without an inflection point\n can lead to a critical layer instability.  When this recipe is further\n expanded to include\n profiles that also have inflection points, the result\n can turn into a self-replicating process and if the conditions are right,\n the shearing box flow might very well transition into a turbulent state.\n\n\n\n\n\n}\n \n\\par\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}\n\n\\bibitem[Baines \n\\& Mitsudera(1994)]{1994JFM...276..327B} Baines, P.~G., \\& Mitsudera, H.\\ 1994, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 276, 327 \n\n\\bibitem[Balmforth \n\\& Piccolo(2001)]{2001JFM...449...85B} Balmforth, N.~J., \\& Piccolo, C.\\ 2001, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 449, 85 \n\n\\bibitem[Barker \n\\& Latter(2015)]{2015MNRAS.450...21B} Barker, A.~J., \\& Latter, H.~N.\\ 2015, \\mnras, 450, 21 \n\n\\bibitem[Drazin(2002)]{2002ihs..book.....D} Drazin, P.~G.\\ 2002, \nIntroduction to Hydrodynamic Stability, by P.~G.~Drazin, pp.~276.~ISBN \n0521804272.~Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, September 2002., 276 \n\n\\bibitem[Drazin \n\\& Reid(2004)]{2004hyst.book.....D} Drazin, P.~G., \\& Reid, W.~H.\\ 2004, Hydrodynamic Stability, by P.~G.~Drazin and W.~H.~Reid, pp.~626.~ISBN 0521525411.~Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, September 2004., 626 \n\n\\bibitem[Dubrulle et \nal.(2005)]{2005A&A...429....1D} Dubrulle, B., Mari{\\'e}, L., Normand, C., et al.\\ 2005, \\aap, 429, 1 \n\n\\bibitem[Dubrulle \n\\& Zahn(1991)]{1991JFM...231..561D} Dubrulle, B., \\& Zahn, J.-P.\\ 1991, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 231, 561 \n\n\\bibitem[Dubrulle \n\\& Knobloch(1992)]{1992A&A...256..673D} Dubrulle, B., \\& Knobloch, E.\\ 1992, \\aap, 256, 673 \n\n\\bibitem[Fricke(1968)]{1968ZA.....68..317F} Fricke, K.\\ 1968, \\zap, 68, 317 \n\n\\bibitem[Goldreich \n\\& Lynden-Bell(1965)]{1965MNRAS.130..125G} Goldreich, P., \\& Lynden-Bell, D.\\ 1965, \\mnras, 130, 125 \n\n\\bibitem[Goldreich \n\\& Schubert(1967)]{1967ApJ...150..571G} Goldreich, P., \\& Schubert, G.\\ 1967, \\apj, 150, 571\n\n\\bibitem[Heifetz et al.(1999)]{1999QJRMS.125.2835H} Heifetz, E., Bishop, \nC.~H., \n\\& Alpert, P.\\ 1999, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 125, 2835 \n\n\\bibitem[Hoskins et al.(1985)]{1985QJRMS.111..877H} Hoskins, B.~J., \nMcIntyre, M.~E., \n\\& Robertson, A.~W.\\ 1985, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 111, 877 \n\n\\bibitem[Klahr \n\\& Bodenheimer(2003)]{2003ApJ...582..869K} Klahr, H.~H., \\& Bodenheimer, P.\\ 2003, \\apj, 582, 869 \n\n\\bibitem[Klahr \n\\& Hubbard(2014)]{2014ApJ...788...21K} Klahr, H., \\& Hubbard, A.\\ 2014, \\apj, 788, 21 \n\n\\bibitem[Lerner \n\\& Knobloch(1988)]{1988JFM...189..117L} Lerner, J., \\& Knobloch, E.\\ 1988, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 189, 117 \n\n\\bibitem[Les \n\\& Lin(2015)]{2015MNRAS.450.1503L} Les, R., \\& Lin, M.-K.\\ 2015, \\mnras, 450, 1503 \n\n\\bibitem[Lesur \n\\& Papaloizou(2010)]{2010A&A...513A..60L} Lesur, G., \\& Papaloizou, J.~C.~B.\\ 2010, \\aap, 513, A60 \n\n\\bibitem[Li et al.(2001)]{2001ApJ...551..874L} Li, H., Colgate, S.~A., \nWendroff, B., \\& Liska, R.\\ 2001, \\apj, 551, 874 \n\n\\bibitem[Li et al.(2000)]{2000ApJ...533.1023L} Li, H., Finn, J.~M., \nLovelace, R.~V.~E., \\& Colgate, S.~A.\\ 2000, \\apj, 533, 1023 \n\n\\bibitem[Lin \n\\& Youdin(2015)]{2015ApJ...811...17L} Lin, M.-K., \\& Youdin, A.~N.\\ 2015, \\apj, 811, 17\n\n\\bibitem[Lobo Gomes et al.(2015)]{2015ApJ...810...94L} Lobo Gomes, A., \nKlahr, H., Uribe, A.~L., Pinilla, P., \\& Surville, C.\\ 2015, \\apj, 810, 94  \n\n\\bibitem[Lovelace et al.(1999)]{1999ApJ...513..805L} Lovelace, R.~V.~E., \nLi, H., Colgate, S.~A., \\& Nelson, A.~F.\\ 1999, \\apj, 513, 805 \n\n\\bibitem[Lyra(2014)]{2014ApJ...789...77L} Lyra, W.\\ 2014, \\apj, 789, 77 \n\n\\bibitem[Lyra \n\\& Klahr(2011)]{2011A&A...527A.138L} Lyra, W., \\& Klahr, H.\\ 2011, \\aap, 527, A138 \n\n\\bibitem[Marcus et al.(2013)]{M13} Marcus, P.~S., Pei, S., \nJiang, C.-H., \n\\& Hassanzadeh, P.\\ 2013, Physical Review Letters, 111, 084501  (M13 in text)\n\n\\bibitem[Marcus et al.(2015)]{M15} Marcus, P.~S., Pei, S., \nJiang, C.-H., et al.\\ 2015, \\apj, 808, 87 \n\n\\bibitem[Meheut et \nal.(2010)]{2010A&A...516A..31M} Meheut, H., Casse, F., Varniere, P., \\& Tagger, M.\\ 2010, \\aap, 516, A31 \n\n\\bibitem[Meheut et al.(2012)]{2012MNRAS.422.2399M} Meheut, H., Yu, C., \n\\& Lai, D.\\ 2012, \\mnras, 422, 2399 \n\n\\bibitem[Nelson et al.(2013)]{2013MNRAS.435.2610N} Nelson, R.~P., Gressel, \nO., \\& Umurhan, O.~M.\\ 2013, \\mnras, 435, 2610 \n\n\\bibitem[Papaloizou \n\\& Pringle(1984)]{1984MNRAS.208..721P} Papaloizou, J.~C.~B., \\& Pringle, J.~E.\\ 1984, \\mnras, 208, 721 \n\n\\bibitem[Petersen et al.(2007a)]{2007ApJ...658.1236P} Petersen, M.~R., \nJulien, K., \\& Stewart, G.~R.\\ 2007, \\apj, 658, 1236 \n\n\\bibitem[Petersen et al.(2007b)]{2007ApJ...658.1252P} Petersen, M.~R., \nStewart, G.~R., \\& Julien, K.\\ 2007, \\apj, 658, 1252 \n\n\\bibitem[Rayleigh(1880)]{Rayleigh1880}\nLord Rayleigh\\ 1880,\nProc.

This\nis understood to represent the primary\nvortex step either rolling-up or undergoing a large amplitude undulation \n(e.g., Tamarin et al. 2015).  There is strong amplitude power in both\nthe mean-forcing and 2k-forcing \nat the critical point $x{_{_{{bg}}}}^+ \\approx 0.62$.\nThe vorticity forcing there is that of a jet (for comparison\nsee the vorticity profile\nassociated with the barotropic jet in Figure \\ref{Velocity_profiles}b), which \nmeans that as the Z-mode instability develops, there will nonlinearly emerge\na jet like structure in the critical layer.\\par\nWhat is unexpected is that the amplitude of this vorticity forcing at\n$x{_{_{{bg}}}}^+$ is driven primarily by the vortex tilting terms: perturbations\nin the velocity fields\ngive rise to perturbations in the horizontal vorticity components $\\zeta{_{_{x}}}',\\zeta{_{_{y}}}'$.\nThese, in turn, nonlinearly couple to the perturbation vertical velocity $w'$ -- in\nthe critical layer these nonlinear products act as source terms \ngenerating vertical vorticity.\n  The radial transport term also contributes significantly in the critical layer,\nbut generally acts opposite to the vorticity generation driven by the vertical tilting\nof horizontal vorticity.  In all instances we have calculated, the\naggregate vortex forcing is non-zero and always dominated by the vortex tilting terms, and mainly\nby the vertical tilting of the radial vorticity $\\zeta_x \\partial_x w$.  We also note that the vortical forcing\nat $x{_{_{{bg}}}}^-$ is comparatively weak although non-zero.  It is remarkable that\nthere is strong power in both the mean and 2k forcings indicating that this\ninstability is quite powerful where it is expressed since many vertical wave numbers\nare excited (see the discussion on growth rates and their dependence on the vertical wave number $m$,\nfound in the previous sections). \nIts expression, however, is constrained to within \na narrow zone of the critical layer whose\nwidth depends upon the growth rate itself: faster growth\nrates mean wider the critical\nlayer zones (see further below).\n\n\\par\n\\bigskip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{asymmetric_jet_lowvamp_forcing.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\nNonlinear vorticity forcing in the mean for the asymmetric jet profile with $\\alpha = 1.3$\n$\\Delta^+ = 0.13$, $\\Delta^- = 0.20$ and $\\omega_a^+ = -0.1 $ (with\n $\\omega_a^- = 0.065 $) and $g\\beta = 4$, the latter\n being comparable\n to conditions examined in M13. \n The model flow profile has an effective Ro $\\sim 0.05$ \n The vertical wavenumber $m = 3.52$ corresponding\nto the fastest growth rate (Im$(\\omega) \\approx 0.011$) \nof the dispersion curve associated with the diamonds shown\nin Figure \\ref{Growth rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}.

We also note that the nonlinear vortical forcing upon the\n model jet is mainly in the region $0<x<0.2$. Given the value of $\\omega_a^+ \\approx -0.12\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$\n it means\n that {\\emph{the nonlinear driving is focused mainly on the anti-cyclonic side of the asymmetric jet}} suggesting\n that this will ultimately result in the nonlinear roll-up of that part of the jet - something\n that is seen throughout the numerical experiment reported in M13.\nEventually, when the value of $\\omega_a^+ $ is strongly in the RWI instability regime\n(i.e. $\\omega_a^+ < \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c1}}}$)\nthe nonlinear forcing is almost entirely focused upon the anti-cyclonic side of the model\njet with relatively little corresponding forcing power at the critical layer zones\nor the cyclonic side of the jet (Figure \\ref{asymmetric_jet_highvamp_forcing}).\n\\par\nAlthough not shown here, the same qualitative pattern holds if $\\omega_a^+$ is sufficiently positive.\nFor example we have examined the results using the same model \njet dimensions assumed for the results shown in Figures \\ref{Vorticity_Forcing_lowvamp}--\\ref{asymmetric_jet_highvamp_forcing}\nincluding the value of $\\alpha\\Delta^+ \\approx 0.16$, $\\delta \\approx 1.54$ and $g\\beta = 4\\Omega{_{_{0}}}^2$ where, instead, we\nexamine the response for positive\nvalues of $\\omega_a^+$.  Inspection of\n Figure \\ref{Barotropic_Growth_rates_profiles_asymmetric_jump}\n shows that the corresponding value of the onset of the RWI for the\n jet is given by $\\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c2}}} \\approx 0.22\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$.  The same pattern of results\n follows - for $0 < \\omega_a^+ < \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c2}}}$ only the Z-mode instability is expressed\n and the nonlinear vortical forcing is dominant in the critical layer zones.\n Similarly, as $\\omega_a^+  > \\omega^+_{a{{\\rm c2}}}$ the RWI becomes more important in which\n the nonlinear vortical forcing is dominant in the vicinity of the model jet.\n In particular, the forcing is concentrated in the region $-0.2 < x < 0$ \n but this also happens to be the anti-cyclonic side of the model jet since $\\omega_a^+ > 0$  means\n $\\omega_a^- < 0$ according to equation (\\ref{restricted_omega_minus}).\n \\par\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=15cm]{asymmetric_jet_medvamp2_forcing.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Like Figure \\ref{Vorticity_Forcing_lowvamp} \nexcept $\\omega{_{_{a}}}^+ = -0.12$ (and $\\omega{_{_{a}}}^- = 0.078$), which\nmeans this is a model flow profile with Ro $\\sim 0.06$: (a)\ntop panel forcing in the mean and (b) forcing in 2k.

They find that after some time, the fluid domain\n steadily transitions into similarly confined narrow/tubular regions of deviation jet-like profiles.\n For a surplus vorticity field placed at the origin containing the midplane, the response flow\n generates jet like vertical vorticity above and below the mid plane at the location of buoyant critical points.\n A close inspection of both Figures 1 and 2 of that work shows that the generated jet-like vertical vorticity fields\n(the original children)  have\n some vertical extent.  As the simulation marches forward in time, these original child vortices \n themselves become parents to a new generation of\n child vortices at new critical layers associated with their parents, and so on the process\n continues.\\footnote{We observe that in the numerical experiment results presented in \n M13, the original tube of surplus vertical vorticity located at the origin remains constituted\n as such throughout the duration of the domain and does not get destroyed.  This is probably\n because the the width and girth of this line charge vorticity is one which does not\n go unstable via the RWI (or its equivalent analog for such a model flow).  Further analysis needs to be done to confirm this conjecture.}  \n The results and intuition derived from the linear study\n considered here largely confirms this self-replicating scenario\n proposed in M13. \\par\n The insights garnered of the analysis here helps to fill in more of the details of this\n emergent (possibly) turbulent self-sustaining process.  A vorticity field supporting a localized\n Rossby wave will generate a new vorticity field at a far-field buoyant critical layer.\n This buoyant critical layer $x_{bg}$ is found to be the location\n where the Doppler shifted frequency of the Rossby wave is resonant with the local\n Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency.  The resonance induces a vortex generation mechanism\n which is dominated by\n two mostly opposing processes: (i) the local creation of vertical vorticity \n in which the local  perturbation radial vorticity\n (i.e. the $\\zeta_x$ found in the region around $x=x_{bg}$)\n is converted into vertical vorticity through the vertical tilting process: \n $\\zeta_x \\partial_x w$, and (ii) the local (again near $x=x_{bg}$) radial advection of the \n perturbation vertical vorticity: $u'\\partial_x \\zeta$.  Both effects act nearly opposite to\n one another, but the vertical tilting mechanism appears to dominate in the jet profiles\n we have tested here in this study.\n \\par\n Among other things, this results in an asymmetric jet-like structure which\n grows in amplitude until it either saturates or the jet itself gets destroyed\n because of roll-up due to the RWI.   While the spawned jet grows it can, on its own\n accord, induce new jet-like structures at new critical points associated with the spawned jet\n and the linear analysis done here largely supports the picture sketched in M13 of {\\emph{jets begetting jets}}.\n As a ``parent\" structure, a jet-like profile can give rise to new ``child\" jets only \n while the parent jet maintains its structural integrity.  This can be inferred from the linear stability\n of the asymmetric jet examined in Section 6.3: as the amplitude of the jet $|\\omega_a^\\pm|$ is increased\n from zero\n first only Z-modes are unstable.  However, as $|\\omega_a^\\pm|$ increases eventually \n the most unstable mode is the RWI which induces transformative/destructive roll up of the\n parent jet.  \n It is only during the low amplitude range of jet amplitudes, prior to the RWI becoming\n important, will a given jet generate into existence a new jet(s) at its\n associated buoyant critical layer(s).\n \\par\n In this way, the parent jet must stay as such long enough for child jets to grow into maturity\n so they too can generate the next generation of jets, and so on perpetuating the\n  self-replication process.  Critical to this is the time spent\n growing each jet - as it must grow slow enough so that the Z-mode instability (which is relatively\n slow by our current account) may manifest itself and start\n spawning the next generation of jets.  If a jet grows too fast then the Z-mode process has no time\n to birth the new generation and the whole process shuts off.  If the jet grows quite slowly\n it could, in a general sense, give rise to a pattern state like that reported in M13.\n Conditions lying somewhere between these two extremes might give rise to a turbulent flow state that could be either\n decaying or self-sustaining\n - perhaps something in the flavor of a ``chaotic propeller\" \n  identified as being operative in subcritical transitions in both plane-Couette \n  and rotating-plane-Couette flows\n  (e.g., see discussion in Rincon et al. 2007). \n \\par\n   Whether or not this process can be self-sustaining and lead to a turbulent state\n   under a wide umbrella of conditions appropriate to Dead Zones\n remains to be determined.  It would seem, however given our considerations,\n that its self-sustainability depends centrally on what way the original disturbances are structured\n since it requires there to be some relatively large amplitude disturbance to start the whole thing off.\n A recent announcement by Marcus et al. (2015) on this process in a shearing sheet disk model with vertically varying gravity and \n stratification seems to indicate that it can give rise to a strongly turbulent state.\n \n \n  \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{2D_jet_rollup.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Two dimensional simulation of the RWI roll-up of the asymmetric\njet problem examined in Section \\ref{RWI_in_asymmetric_jet}\nwith $\\omega_a^+ = -0.2\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$, $\\omega_a^- = -0.13\\Omega{_{_{0}}}$\nwith $\\Delta^+ = 0.13$ and $\\Delta^- = 0.2$ and $\\epsilon = 1/50$.

The discussion\nin the previous section concerning\n the self-reproductive spatial spreading of jet creation/destruction\n is the expected outcome of the former of the two conditions.  What might happen\n when the critical layer appears inside the shear layer?  \n \\par Consider the nonlinear\n vorticity forcing arising from the conditions\n shown in Figure \\ref{omega_Z_Shear_Layer_solutions}b in which the critical layer\n is clearly inside the shear layer and the shear layer itself is stable against\n the destructive RWI.  We show in Figure \\ref{confined_transition} the corresponding \n mean vertical vorticity forcing profile\n arising under these parameter conditions\n $g\\beta < N_{{\\rm cr}}^2$.  The imprint of the primary shear layer is  \n evident in the vicinity of the locations $x\\approx \\pm 0.14$ while\n the nonlinear forcing at the critical layer is also \n clearly visible near $x\\approx \\pm 0.045$.  \n The resulting aggregate forcing profile qualitatively resembles forcing profiles\n we have discussed thus far\n for when the critical layers appear outside.  We observe that unlike the examples of the\n vorticity-step and jet profiles, the critical layer jets are primarily\n driven by the radial advection of the perturbation vertical vorticity\n ($-u\\partial_x \\zeta$)\n  while\n the vertical tilting of radial perturbation vorticity\n ($\\zeta_x \\partial_x w$) is relatively weak by comparison but acts\n with the same sense as the radial advection of the perturbation vertical vorticity.\n \\par The implications are interesting: These results suggest that\n under those conditions in which the {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency is small,\n that jets will grow inside the shear layer and, as per our\nearlier insights, once the jet amplitude grows large enough it will self-destruct while\ngenerating new jets associated with its critical layers.  If the whole process remains\nconfined to inside the shear layer, then there are at least two possible outcomes:  In the first\nof these,\nthe parent shear layer structure remains stable \n(also as suggested by linear analysis) while the jet inside grows and once\nhaving reached a sufficient amplitude it will self-destruct having spawned child jets\nalong the way (presumably contained inside the shear layer as well).  The second possibility\nis that while the jet inside grows, the parent shear layer nonlinearly destructs as well.\nIf an external agent is responsible for the creation and maintenence of the parent shear layer in the first\nplace -- e.g, by either direct thermally driven relaxation (Les \\& Lin, 2015, Lobo Gomes et al., 2015)\nor by the VSI (Richard et al., 2015) -- \nthen either of the two scenarios envisioned could give rise to a process of \nunsteady jet creation and destruction entirely contained inside the shear layer, where the only\ndifference in the outcomes of the two possibilities is the degree of the unsteady activity -- possibly\nturbulent.  Global numerical calculations of the several processes mentioned (thermally driven\nrelaxation or the VSI), when sufficiently resolved,\ncan test whether or not this dynamical scenario indeed manifests itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\leavevmode\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{nonlinear_forcing_omega_SHEAR_LAYER_0p41.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The nonlinear vorticity driving for the linear solutions\nshown in Figure \\ref{omega_Z_Shear_Layer_solutions}b.

The relatively sophisticated\napproach, which involves converting the underlying linearized differential system instead into a set of coupled\nintegral equations, is here undertaken because\nof the complexities inherent to discerning eigenmode structure \nof PDEs supporting one or more irregular singular points.

The localization scales linearly with the growth rate of the Z-mode \n- a lower growth\nrates means a narrower critical layer zone.  \nThis trend is probably why many previous\nnumerical simulations (prior to M13),\nconducted both in shearing sheet and cylindrical geometries,\nhave been unable to \nsee any evidence of this effect. \\par\nWe have examined with some detail the conditions\nin which unstable Z-modes exist both independently of and concurrently with\nthe RWI in the shear-layer model.  Using conditions similar\nto that examined in M13 (namely, fixed horizontal box size and shear layer width) \nwe demonstrate for shear layers\nwhose amplitudes $\\omega{_{_{a}}}$ lie between $\\omega{_{_{Z}}} > \\omega{_{_{a}}} > \\omega{_{_{R}}}$\nthat Z-modes exist in the absence of the RWI.  The condition $\\omega{_{_{a}}} = \\omega{_{_{R}}}$\nis the condition for the onset of the RWI and for values of \n$\\omega{_{_{a}}} < \\omega{_{_{R}}}$ both instabilities are present.  \n $\\omega{_{_{Z}}}$, \nwhich is the critical value of the onset of Z-modes, \nis a function of the {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency $g\\beta$ and the former's\ndependence upon the latter\nwas numerically determined for the special\ncase considered and summarized in Figure \\ref{omega_Z_Shear_Layer}.\nIt is unexpected that the instability persists even in the limit\nwhere the stratification vanishes ($g\\beta \\rightarrow 0$) suggesting that plain\ninertial modes in the shearing sheet should also be unstable \nunder suitable conditions in the presence of any number\nof model flows like those considered here.  This remains to be further examined.\n\\par\nThe qualitative trends\nregarding the existence of Z-modes and their concurrence with the RWI\n reported above for the shear layer carry over to the jet flow model\nas well.  However, the same relatively\ndetailed analysis done for the shear layer model\nremains to be done for the jet flow model.\\par\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\par\n\\medskip\nGiven the calculated perturbation responses including the derived\nvelocity and vorticity fields,\none can assess the total nonlinear vertical vortex forcing arising from these modes\naccording to equation (\\ref{vortex_tilting}).  What is remarkable is that \nat the buoyant critical layer $x{_{_{{bg}}}}$ there are two main competitive effects driving \nthe nonlinear response, namely,\nthat of the radial transport of the perturbation vertical vorticity, $u'\\partial_x\\zeta'$,\nand the vertical tilting  \nof the perturbation {radial vorticity}, $\\zeta_x'\\partial_x w'$.\nFigure \\ref{nonlinear_vorticity_forcing_1j}, which\nserves as a representative depiction of these varied forcings,\nshows the vertical tilting of the radial perturbation vorticity generally\nwinning out over the radial advection of perturbation\nvertical vorticity and, ultimately, giving rise to a vertically/azimuthally uniform\njet flow as well as power in higher harmonics in \nthe azimuthal and vertical directions.  The emerging jet flow is strongly localized due to the\nsize of the original critical layer.  This resultant nonlinear forcing\nat the buoyant critical layers is the same for all three model flows examined\nhere.  \n\\par\nWe note that the only qualitative difference in the outcome of the instability\nin the critical layer is in the sign in the change of vorticity\nacross the central ridge line of the emerging jet, which\ndepends upon whether or not $u'\\partial_x\\zeta'$ \ndominates $\\zeta_x'\\partial_x w'$ inside the critical layer during the growth\nof the instability.  This is because these two forcing terms appear to act\nopposite to one another - at least this is so in all of the profiles we have\nexamined while preparing this study.\n\\par\nWe have also shown here\nthat both jets and shear layers are subject to the RWI if their vorticity\namplitudes get large enough.  We have considered this in detail for\nthe jet model flow where we find that as the amplitude of the jet approaches\nthe critical value needed for\nthe onset of the RWI, the nonlinear forcing upon itself increases\nas well (sequenced in Figures  \n\\ref{Vorticity_Forcing_lowvamp}--\\ref{asymmetric_jet_highvamp_forcing}).\nMoreover, this nonlinear self interaction, which is separate from\nthe nonlinear forcing occurring at the buoyant critical layers, \nis focused mainly on the anti-cyclonic side\n\\footnote{Recall that parts of the shear flow are\ntermed anti-cyclonic with respect to the background Keplerian shear flow.  See \ndiscussion formal definition of this found in Section 4.}\n of the jet which\nshould cause it to undergo a roll-up type of instability.\n\\par\n\nIndeed, the study of \\citet{Talia2015}\n explicitly examines how the $2k$-forcing\\footnote{as defined in Section 8.}\n of an unstable Rayleigh shear layer is most\nresponsible for the destructive transformation of the shear layer in the nonlinear regime.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Figure \\ref{2D_jet_rollup} depicts this\nfor a model two-dimensional simulation of an unstable jet \nof the kind examined in Section \\ref{RWI_in_asymmetric_jet}\n(numerical method details discussed in figure caption)\nshowing the nonlinear roll-up of\na jet profile subject to the RWI.\nOnly the anticyclonic part\nrolls up while the cylonic portion remains more or less intact.\nThe qualitative features of the roll-up sequence of the model asymmetric jet\nshown mirrors that of the\nsimulations snapshots shown in M13.  We emphasize that the\nnumerical experiment of the model jet shown in Figure \\ref{2D_jet_rollup} is two-dimensional and cannot\nrepresent the later generation of new jets at the model jet's associated buoyant critical layers.\nNonetheless, the point we wish to make is\nthe claim that this part of the process discussed in M13\ncan be understood independently within the framework of the RWI.\nA similar role of the RWI has been recently uncovered in the nonlinear development\nof the VSI (Richard et al., 2015).\n\\par\nThe totality of the aforementioned results leads one into considering\nthe possibility, as originally suggested in M13, that\nunder suitable conditions the nonlinear outcome of this instability\nis that of a self-replicating dynamical\nmechanism of jet creation and destruction.\nIf the circumstances are just right, this could result in widespread turbulence\nwhich could perhaps be sustained. \nA given parent jet flow\ncan bring into being, through the Z-mode instability, a first generation\nof child jets at the buoyant\ncritical layers of the parent.  Once the amplitude of the child jets grows\nlarge enough they, in turn, bring into existence a second generation of child\njets\nat the buoyant critical layers associated with the first generation, and so\non the process continues.  However, once the vorticity amplitudes of the first\ngeneration get large enough, the jets will experience the RWI destroying\nthe anticyclonic side of their flow profiles and, possibly, severely disrupting the orderly flow of\ntheir cyclonic sides as well.  \nA once quiet laminar disk can undergo a transformation into a non-steady\ndynamical state as the creation/destruction process described herein replicates\nitself and spreads over the entirety of the domain.\n\\par\nOf course, the robustness of the overall scenario described \nand its relevance\nto real protoplanetary disk Dead Zones remains to be assessed and should be the focus\nof future study.\nSuch an evaluation should\ncenter on the fact that the zombie vortex instability requires the presence of a large amplitude initial\ndisturbance (like the three model flows considered in this study) \nto set off the process in the first place.  How does such\na configuration come about in the first place would have to be plausibly\nexplained and somehow justified.   The recent numerical \nwork of \\citet{M15},\nwhich examines this process for a more realistic disk model in which, effectively\nspeaking with respect to our analysis, the {Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a \\ } frequency is\na function of the vertical coordinate,\nreports a similar pattern of eruption of the laminar state\nand subsequent transformation into an unsteady dynamical flow.  A\nparallel linear analysis like that done here but applied in the more \nphysically relevant\nsetting considered by Marcus et al. (2015) -- in which\nthe vertical gravity and stratification is coordinate dependent --\n is both challenging and awaits to be done.\n \\par\n \\medskip\n It appears that our conceptions regarding the nature and development of \n disk activity -- possibly even turbulent -- have returned to some ideas\n that were discussed nearly 25 years ago.  \n In an often overlooked study by Dubrulle \\& Knobloch (1992)\n the authors performed a careful analysis of a non-stratified shearing box \n and showed that all small amplitude disturbances\n are stable.  They went on to argue that a pure Keplerian\n flow is not enough to generate an instability and they went further\n to stress that some other\n additional {\\emph{finite}} amplitude profile -- which possesses at least\n one inflection point -- would be necessary to instigate some kind\n of turbulent transition in a (non-magnetized) disk.  \n Two previous studies done right prior\n to that work, namely by Lerner \\& Knobloch (1988) and\n Dubrulle \\& Zahn (1991), explicitly demonstrated that instability\n was feasible in a plane-Couette setting\n with a flow profile similar to the shear layer profile\n examined in this work. \n Indeed, one can argue that the RWI is an example of such an inflection point\n instability since the shearing\n box is the rotating version of classical plane-Couette flow\n and the flow profiles examined in the original study of \n Lovelace et al. (1999) contain at least one inflection point.\n  We see the Zombie vortex discovery by M13 and Marcus et al. (2015)\n -- as well as the linear analysis we have conducted here -- as taking the\n vision expounded by Dubrulle \\& Knobloch (1992)\n one step further for a stratified shearing box:  \n that a finite amplitude profile without an inflection point\n can lead to a critical layer instability.  When this recipe is further\n expanded to include\n profiles that also have inflection points, the result\n can turn into a self-replicating process and if the conditions are right,\n the shearing box flow might very well transition into a turbulent state.\n\n\n\n\n\n}\n \n\\par\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}\n\n\\bibitem[Baines \n\\& Mitsudera(1994)]{1994JFM...276..327B} Baines, P.~G., \\& Mitsudera, H.\\ 1994, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 276, 327 \n\n\\bibitem[Balmforth \n\\& Piccolo(2001)]{2001JFM...449...85B} Balmforth, N.~J., \\& Piccolo, C.\\ 2001, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 449, 85 \n\n\\bibitem[Barker \n\\& Latter(2015)]{2015MNRAS.450...21B} Barker, A.~J., \\& Latter, H.~N.\\ 2015, \\mnras, 450, 21 \n\n\\bibitem[Drazin(2002)]{2002ihs..book.....D} Drazin, P.~G.\\ 2002, \nIntroduction to Hydrodynamic Stability, by P.~G.~Drazin, pp.~276.~ISBN \n0521804272.~Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, September 2002., 276 \n\n\\bibitem[Drazin \n\\& Reid(2004)]{2004hyst.book.....D} Drazin, P.~G., \\& Reid, W.~H.\\ 2004, Hydrodynamic Stability, by P.~G.~Drazin and W.~H.~Reid, pp.~626.~ISBN 0521525411.~Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, September 2004., 626 \n\n\\bibitem[Dubrulle et \nal.(2005)]{2005A&A...429....1D} Dubrulle, B., Mari{\\'e}, L., Normand, C., et al.\\ 2005, \\aap, 429, 1 \n\n\\bibitem[Dubrulle \n\\& Zahn(1991)]{1991JFM...231..561D} Dubrulle, B., \\& Zahn, J.-P.\\ 1991, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 231, 561 \n\n\\bibitem[Dubrulle \n\\& Knobloch(1992)]{1992A&A...256..673D} Dubrulle, B., \\& Knobloch, E.\\ 1992, \\aap, 256, 673 \n\n\\bibitem[Fricke(1968)]{1968ZA.....68..317F} Fricke, K.\\ 1968, \\zap, 68, 317 \n\n\\bibitem[Goldreich \n\\& Lynden-Bell(1965)]{1965MNRAS.130..125G} Goldreich, P., \\& Lynden-Bell, D.\\ 1965, \\mnras, 130, 125 \n\n\\bibitem[Goldreich \n\\& Schubert(1967)]{1967ApJ...150..571G} Goldreich, P., \\& Schubert, G.\\ 1967, \\apj, 150, 571\n\n\\bibitem[Heifetz et al.(1999)]{1999QJRMS.125.2835H} Heifetz, E., Bishop, \nC.~H., \n\\& Alpert, P.\\ 1999, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 125, 2835 \n\n\\bibitem[Hoskins et al.(1985)]{1985QJRMS.111..877H} Hoskins, B.~J., \nMcIntyre, M.~E., \n\\& Robertson, A.~W.\\ 1985, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 111, 877 \n\n\\bibitem[Klahr \n\\& Bodenheimer(2003)]{2003ApJ...582..869K} Klahr, H.~H., \\& Bodenheimer, P.\\ 2003, \\apj, 582, 869 \n\n\\bibitem[Klahr \n\\& Hubbard(2014)]{2014ApJ...788...21K} Klahr, H., \\& Hubbard, A.\\ 2014, \\apj, 788, 21 \n\n\\bibitem[Lerner \n\\& Knobloch(1988)]{1988JFM...189..117L} Lerner, J., \\& Knobloch, E.\\ 1988, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 189, 117 \n\n\\bibitem[Les \n\\& Lin(2015)]{2015MNRAS.450.1503L} Les, R., \\& Lin, M.-K.\\ 2015, \\mnras, 450, 1503 \n\n\\bibitem[Lesur \n\\& Papaloizou(2010)]{2010A&A...513A..60L} Lesur, G., \\& Papaloizou, J.~C.~B.\\ 2010, \\aap, 513, A60 \n\n\\bibitem[Li et al.(2001)]{2001ApJ...551..874L} Li, H., Colgate, S.~A., \nWendroff, B., \\& Liska, R.\\ 2001, \\apj, 551, 874 \n\n\\bibitem[Li et al.(2000)]{2000ApJ...533.1023L} Li, H., Finn, J.~M., \nLovelace, R.~V.~E., \\& Colgate, S.~A.\\ 2000, \\apj, 533, 1023 \n\n\\bibitem[Lin \n\\& Youdin(2015)]{2015ApJ...811...17L} Lin, M.-K., \\& Youdin, A.~N.\\ 2015, \\apj, 811, 17\n\n\\bibitem[Lobo Gomes et al.(2015)]{2015ApJ...810...94L} Lobo Gomes, A., \nKlahr, H., Uribe, A.~L., Pinilla, P., \\& Surville, C.\\ 2015, \\apj, 810, 94  \n\n\\bibitem[Lovelace et al.(1999)]{1999ApJ...513..805L} Lovelace, R.~V.~E., \nLi, H., Colgate, S.~A., \\& Nelson, A.~F.\\ 1999, \\apj, 513, 805 \n\n\\bibitem[Lyra(2014)]{2014ApJ...789...77L} Lyra, W.\\ 2014, \\apj, 789, 77 \n\n\\bibitem[Lyra \n\\& Klahr(2011)]{2011A&A...527A.138L} Lyra, W., \\& Klahr, H.\\ 2011, \\aap, 527, A138 \n\n\\bibitem[Marcus et al.(2013)]{M13} Marcus, P.~S., Pei, S., \nJiang, C.-H., \n\\& Hassanzadeh, P.\\ 2013, Physical Review Letters, 111, 084501  (M13 in text)\n\n\\bibitem[Marcus et al.(2015)]{M15} Marcus, P.~S., Pei, S., \nJiang, C.-H., et al.\\ 2015, \\apj, 808, 87 \n\n\\bibitem[Meheut et \nal.(2010)]{2010A&A...516A..31M} Meheut, H., Casse, F., Varniere, P., \\& Tagger, M.\\ 2010, \\aap, 516, A31 \n\n\\bibitem[Meheut et al.(2012)]{2012MNRAS.422.2399M} Meheut, H., Yu, C., \n\\& Lai, D.\\ 2012, \\mnras, 422, 2399 \n\n\\bibitem[Nelson et al.(2013)]{2013MNRAS.435.2610N} Nelson, R.~P., Gressel, \nO., \\& Umurhan, O.~M.\\ 2013, \\mnras, 435, 2610 \n\n\\bibitem[Papaloizou \n\\& Pringle(1984)]{1984MNRAS.208..721P} Papaloizou, J.~C.~B., \\& Pringle, J.~E.\\ 1984, \\mnras, 208, 721 \n\n\\bibitem[Petersen et al.(2007a)]{2007ApJ...658.1236P} Petersen, M.~R., \nJulien, K., \\& Stewart, G.~R.\\ 2007, \\apj, 658, 1236 \n\n\\bibitem[Petersen et al.(2007b)]{2007ApJ...658.1252P} Petersen, M.~R., \nStewart, G.~R., \\& Julien, K.\\ 2007, \\apj, 658, 1252 \n\n\\bibitem[Rayleigh(1880)]{Rayleigh1880}\nLord Rayleigh\\ 1880,\nProc.
