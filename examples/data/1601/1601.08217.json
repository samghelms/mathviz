A sample of\n313 reference H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of the counterpart method ($C$\nmethod) is used as calibrating data points. Relations for the\ndetermination of nitrogen abundances, the $R$ calibration, are also\nconstructed.  We find that the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in\nhigh-metallicity  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions can be estimated using the\nintensities of the two strong lines $R_{2}$ and $N_{2}$ (or $S_{2}$\nand $N_{2}$ for oxygen) only. The corresponding two-dimensional\nrelations are provided. There are considerable advantages of the\nsuggested calibration relations as compared to the existing ones.\nFirst, the oxygen and nitrogen abundances estimated through the\nsuggested calibrations agree with the $T_{e}$-based abundances within\n$\\sim 0.1$ dex over the whole metallicity range, i.e., the relative \naccuracy of the calibration-based abundances is 0.1 dex. Although we\nconstructed distinct relations for high- and low-metallicity objects,\nthe separation between these two can be simply obtained from the\nintensity of the $N_{2}$ line. Moreover, the applicability ranges of\nthe high- and low-metallicity relations overlap for adjacent\nmetallicities, i.e., the transition zone disappears.  Second, the\noxygen abundances produced by the two suggested calibrations are in\nremarkable agreement with each other. In fact, the $R$-based and\n$S$-based oxygen abundances agree within $\\sim$0.05 dex in the\nmajority of cases for more than three thousand H\\,{\\sc ii} region\nspectra. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\ngalaxies: abundances -- ISM: abundances -- H\\,{\\sc ii} regions \n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\nReliable chemical abundance determinations are essential for a wide\nvariety of investigations of galaxies and their evolution. \nFor example, on global scales they are one of the key parameters in\nthe study of the luminosity-metallicity and mass-metallicity relations\nof galaxies, their evolution with time, and their dependence on\nenvironment or star formation rate \\citep[e.g.,][to just name a few of the\nmany studies]{Lequeux1979, Grebel2003, Tremonti2004, Erb2006,\nPanter2008, Zahid2012, Sanchez2013, Peng2014, Zahid2014, Izotov2015}.\nLocal measurements within galaxies reveal the position-dependent\nmetallicity of the chosen tracer population and may show abundance\ngradients, which in turn hold clues about galaxy evolution\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Searle1971, Janes1979, Maciel1999, Harbeck2001,\nAndrievsky2002, Chen2003, Mehlert2003, Cioni2009, Haschke2012,\nBoeche2013, Boeche2014, Pilyugin2014, Pilyugin2015}.  \n  \nThe metallicity of star-forming galaxies at the present epoch can\nbe estimated from the emission-line spectra of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions,\nwhich are easily obtained even over greater distances. It is believed\nthat the direct $T_{e}$ method \\citep[e.g.,][]{Dinerstein1990}\nprovides the most reliable abundance determinations in H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions. Abundance determinations through the direct $T_{e}$ method\nrequire high-precision spectroscopy of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions in order\nto detect the weak auroral lines such as [O\\,{\\sc iii}]$\\lambda$4363\nor/and [N\\,{\\sc ii}]$\\lambda$5755.  Unfortunately, these auroral lines\nare often rather faint and thus may be detected only in the spectra of\na limited number of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  The abundances in other\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions are then usually estimated through the method\nsuggested by \\citet{Pagel1979} and \\citet{Alloin1979}.  The idea of\nthis method (traditionally called the strong-line method) is to\nestablish the relation between the (oxygen) abundance in an H\\,{\\sc\nii} region and some combination of the intensities of strong emission\nlines in its spectrum, i.e., the combination of the intensities of\nthese strong lines is calibrated in terms of the metallicity of the\nH\\,{\\sc ii} region.  Therefore, such a relation is usually called a\n``calibration'' and serves to convert metallicity-sensitive\nemission-line combinations into metallicity estimations.  \n\nNumerous calibrations based on the emission lines of different\nelements were suggested \\citep[][among many\nothers]{Edmunds1984,Dopita1986,McGaugh1991,Zaritsky1994,Pilyugin2000,Pilyugin2001a,Kewley2002,\nPettini2004,Tremonti2004,Pilyugin2005,Stasinska2006,Pilyugin2010,Marino2013,MoralesLuis2014}.\nA prominent characteristic of all the calibrations is that there is no\nunique relation that is applicable across the whole range of\nmetallicities of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions. Instead, a calibration relation\nfor a limited range of metallicities or distinct calibration relations\nfor different intervals of metallicities (usually at high or at low\nmetallicities) are constructed.  One has to know {\\em a priori} to\nwhich interval of metallicity the H\\,{\\sc ii} region belongs in order\nto choose the relevant calibration relation \n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Kewley2002,Blanc2015}. This can result in a\nwrong choice of the calibration relation and, as a consequence, in\nlarge uncertainties in the abundances of the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.\nThis problem is particularly difficult for H\\,{\\sc ii} regions that\nlie near the boundary of the applicability of the calibration\nrelation. \n\nThe most important characteristic of the calibration is a sample of\ncalibrating data points to be used in the construction of the\ncalibration relation.  Grids of photoionization models of H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions can be used to establish a relation between strong-line\nintensities and oxygen abundances\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{McCall1985,Dopita1986,McGaugh1991,Kewley2002,Dopita2013}.  \nSuch calibrations are usually referred to as theoretical or model\ncalibrations.  On the other hand, a sample of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions in\nwhich the oxygen abundances are determined through the direct $T_{e}$\nmethod can serve as basis of a calibration\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Pilyugin2000,Pilyugin2001a,Pilyugin2010,Marino2013}.\nSuch calibrations are usually called empirical calibrations. There are\nalso a hybrid calibrations where both the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with\ndirectly measured abundances and the photoionization models of H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions are used \\citep[e.g.,][]{Pettini2004}. \n\nThere are large systematic discrepancies between the abundance values\nproduced by different published calibrations. The theoretical (or\nmodel) calibrations generally produce oxygen abundances that are by\nfactors of 1.5 to 5 higher than those derived through the direct\n$T_{e}$ method or through empirical calibrations\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Kennicutt2003,Pilyugin2003a,Kewley2008,Bresolin2009,\nMoustakas2010,LopezSanchez2010,LopezSanchez2012}. \nThus, at the present time there is no absolute scale for metallicities\nof H\\,{\\sc ii} regions. The empirical calibrations have advantages as\ncompared to the theoretical calibrations. The empirical metallicity\nscale is well defined in terms of the abundances in H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions derived through the direct $T_e$ method, i.e., in that sense\nthe empirical metallicity scale is absolute. The abundances in H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions obtained through the different empirical calibrations are\ncompatible with each other as well as with the direct $T_e$-based\nabundances.  The empirical metallicity scale is likely the preferable\nmetallicity scale at present.\n\nThe construction of an empirical calibration encounters the following\ndifficulty. Not all direct abundances are of high precision since the\nmeasurements of the weak auroral lines can involve considerable \nerrors. Therefore the choice of a sample of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions\nwith reliable abundances is not a trivial task. We recently suggested\na new method (the ``C method'') for abundance determinations in\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions, which can be used over the whole range of\nmetallicities of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions and which provides oxygen and\nnitrogen abundances on the same metallicity scale as the classical\n$T_{e}$ method \\citep{Pilyugin2012}.  It is important that the $C$\nmethod allows one to choose a sample of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with\nreliable $T_{e}$-based abundances \\citep{Pilyugin2012,Pilyugin2013,Zinchenko2016}. \n\nThe goal of the present study is to establish simple calibration\nrelations that provide the oxygen and nitrogen abundance\ndeterminations over the whole range of H\\,{\\sc ii} region\nmetallicities with relative errors less than 0.1 dex.  The \npaper is structured as follows.  The sample of calibrating data \npoints is reported in Section 2.  The calibration relations are \nconstructed in Section 3.  The discussion is given in Section 4, \nfollowed by a summary (Section 5).\n\nThroughout the paper, we will use the following standard notations \nfor the line intensities: \\\\ \n$R_2$  = $I_{\\rm [O\\,II] \\lambda 3727+ \\lambda 3729} /I_{{\\rm H}\\beta }$,  \\\\\n$N_2$  = $I_{\\rm [N\\,II] \\lambda 6548+ \\lambda 6584} /I_{{\\rm H}\\beta }$,  \\\\\n$S_2$  = $I_{\\rm [S\\,II] \\lambda 6717+ \\lambda 6731} /I_{{\\rm H}\\beta }$,  \\\\\n$R_3$  = $I_{{\\rm [O\\,III]} \\lambda 4959+ \\lambda 5007} /I_{{\\rm H}\\beta }$.  \\\\\n\nBased on these definitions, the excitation parameter $P$ is expressed\nas $P$ = $R_{3}$/$R_{23}$ = $R_{3}$/($R_{2}$ + $R_{3}$).  The electron\ntemperatures will be given in units of 10$^4$K.  The notation\n(O/H)$^{*}$ = 12 +log(O/H) will be used in order to permit us to write\nour equations in a compact way.\n\n\n\n\\section{The sample of the calibrating data points}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\resizebox{1.00\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=000]{Fig01.eps}}\n\\caption{The normalized histograms of the oxygen and nitrogen abundances \nfor our sample of calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions. }\n\\label{figure:gistxhe}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIt was noted above that the choice of a sample of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions\nwith reliable abundance determinations is not a trivial task.  Such a\nsample was compiled in the framework of the $C$ method for abundance\ndeterminations in H\\,{\\sc ii} regions \\citep{Pilyugin2012}. This\nselection of reference H\\,{\\sc ii} regions is based on the idea that\nif an H\\,{\\sc ii} region belongs to the sequence of photoionized\nnebulae, and its line intensities are measured accurately, then\ndifferent methods based on different emission lines should yield\nsimilar physical characteristics (such as electron temperatures and\nabundances) for a given object \\citep{Thuan2010,Pilyugin2012}. \n\nThe original compilation of reference H\\,{\\sc ii} region spectra with\ndetected auroral lines (and, consequently, with $T_{e}$-based\nabundances) that was created in \\citet{Pilyugin2012} has been updated\nby adding more recent measurements of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  The latest\nversion of the collection includes 965 $T_{e}$-based abundances.  Using\nthose data we select a sample of reference H\\,{\\sc ii} regions for\nwhich all absolute differences in their oxygen abundances\n(O/H)$_{C_{\\rm ON}}$  -- (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ and (O/H)$_{C_{\\rm NS}}$  --\n(O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ and nitrogen abundances (N/H)$_{C_{\\rm ON}}$  --\n(N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ and (N/H)$_{C_{\\rm NS}}$  -- (N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ are less\nthan 0.1 dex. This sample of reference H\\,{\\sc ii} regions contains\n313 objects \\citep{Zinchenko2016} and will be used as calibrating data\nset in the present study.  Hence, here we use the empirical\nmetallicity scale defined by H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with abundances\nderived through the direct method ($T_e$ method).  \n\nFig.~\\ref{figure:gistxhe} shows the normalized histograms of the\noxygen and nitrogen abundances for the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of our\nreference sample. \n\n\\section{Calibration relations}\n\n\n\\subsection{Approach}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\resizebox{0.980\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=000]{Fig02.eps}}\n\\caption{\nOxygen abundances (panel $a1$), nitrogen abundances (panel $a2$), \nand electron temperatures $t_{3}$ (panel $a3$) as a function\nof the nitrogen line $N_{2}$ intensity for our sample of H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions used as calibrating data points.

The panels $b1,\nb2, b3$ show the same as the panels $a1, a2, a3$ but as a\nfunction of the oxygen line $R_{2}$ intensity. \n}\n\\label{figure:ln2xhte}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe panels in the left column of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte} show the\noxygen abundances (panel $a1$), nitrogen abundances (panel $a2$), and\nelectron temperatures $t_{3}$ (panel $a3$) as a function of the\nnitrogen line N$_{2}$ intensity for our sample of reference  H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions.  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with different values of the\nexcitation parameter $P$ are plotted with different symbols.  It should be\nnoted that the electron temperature $t_{3}$ within the zone O$^{++}$\nwas not measured in some of the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions used as\ncalibrating data points.  Instead, the electron temperature $t_{2}$\nwithin the zone N$^{+}$ or the electron temperature $t_{3,S}$ within\nthe zone S$^{++}$ was measured. In those cases, the electron\ntemperature $t_{3}$ was derived from the electron temperature $t_{2}$\nadopting the commonly used relation between $t_{3}$ and $t_{2}$\n\\citep{Campbell1986,Garnett1992} or from the electron temperature\n$t_{3,S}$ through the $t_{3}$ -- $t_{3,S}$ relation from\n\\citet{Garnett1992}.   \n\nPanel $a3$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte} suggests that the nitrogen\nline $N_{2}$ intensity can be used as an indicator of the electron\ntemperature in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region. The electron temperature $t_{3}$\nis a monotonic function of logN${_2}$ across the whole range of\nelectron temperatures in  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  However, there is an\nappreciable difference in this relation at high and low temperatures.\nThere is a distinct dependence of the $t$ -- $N_{2}$ relation on the\nvalue of the excitation parameter $P$ at high electron temperatures\nand this dependence disappears at low temperatures. The transition\nbetween the two regimes happens at log$N_{2} \\approx -0.6$.  The\nnitrogen and oxygen abundances are also a monotonic functions of the\nnitrogen line N$_{2}$ intensity as can be seen in panels $a2$ and $a1$\nof Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte}. The  N/H -- $N_{2}$ (or O/H -- $N_{2}$)\nrelation depends also on the value of the excitation parameter $P$ at\nlow metallicities (high electron temperatures) and this dependence\ndisappears at high metallicities (low electron temperatures). \n\nThe variation of the $t$ -- $N_{2}$ and the X/H -- $N_{2}$ relations\nwith the value of the excitation parameter $P$ seems to reflect the\nchange of the contribution of the emission of the low ionization zone\nto the total emission of an H\\,{\\sc ii} region.  If this is the case\nthen the difference in the dependence of the $t$ -- $N_{2}$ and the\nX/H -- $N_{2}$ relations on the value of the excitation parameter $P$\nat high and low electron temperatures can be interpreted in the\nfollowing way.  Hot H\\,{\\sc ii} regions have usually a high excitation\nlevel while cool H\\,{\\sc ii} regions are areas of low excitation. A\nsimilar change of the value of the excitation parameter $P$ (say, by\n0.1) corresponds to different changes of the low ionization zone\ncontribution to the total emission in hot and cool H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions.  Indeed, the variation of $P$ from 0.8 to 0.9 in hot H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions corresponds to the change of the low ionization zone\ncontribution by a factor of 2 (from 20 to 10\\%) while the similar\nvariation of $P$ from 0.1 to 0.2 in cool H\\,{\\sc ii} regions\ncorresponds to the change of the low ionization zone contribution by\na factor of only $\\approx 1.12$ (from 90 to 80\\%). \n\nThe panels in the right column of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte} show the\noxygen abundance (panel $b1$), the nitrogen abundance (panel $b2$),\nand the electron temperature $t_{3}$ (panel $b3$) as a function of\noxygen line R$_{2}$ intensity for our calibration sample.  H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions with different values of the excitation parameter $P$ are\nshown by different symbols.  It is well known that the relation\nbetween the oxygen abundance and the strong oxygen line intensities is\ndouble-valued with two distinct parts traditionally labeled as the\nupper (high-metallicity) and lower (low-metallicity) branch.  The\npanels $b2$ and $b3$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte} show that the\ngeneral behaviour of the N/H -- $R_{2}$ and the $t$ -- $R_{2}$\ndiagrams are similar to that of the  O/H -- $R_{2}$ diagram, i.e.,\nthey are also double-valued.  Again the $t$ -- $R_{2}$ (and X/H --\n$R_{2}$) relation depends on the value of the excitation parameter\n$P$ at low metallicities (high electron temperatures). This dependence\ndisappears at high metallicities (low electron temperatures). \n\nThus, the examination of  Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte} suggests that\ndifferent O/H --  $R_{2}$ (and N/H --  $R_{2}$) relations should be\nconstructed for the upper and lower branches.  The transition from the\nupper to lower branch occurs at log$N_{2} \\sim-0.6$.  It should be\nnoted that the use of the fixed value of $N_{2}$ as a dividing\ncriterion between the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of the upper and lower\nbranches may be an oversimplification.  A more sophisticated condition\nsuch as a fixed electron temperature or/and a fixed oxygen abundance\nmay provide a more reliable boundary criterion between objects on the\nlower and upper branches. \n\nIn general, the relation between the oxygen abundance in an H\\,{\\sc\nii} region on the upper (lower) branch and the oxygen $R_{2}$ line\nintensity in its spectrum depends on two parameters: the electron\ntemperature and the level of excitation.

On the one hand, this suggests that\nour reference sample does indeed contain H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with\nreliable oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$.  On the other hand, this\nindicates that the chosen form of the calibration relations,\nEq.~\\ref{equation:ohgeneral}, allows us to reproduce the relation\nbetween the oxygen abundances in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region and the\nintensities of the strong emission lines in its spectrum rather well.   \n\n\n\\subsubsection{S calibrations} \n\n\n\nThere are many measurements of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions where the line\n$R_{2}$ is not available, for instance in the spectra of nearby\ngalaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). It has been argued\nthat the oxygen abundance in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region can be estimated\neven if the line $R_{2}$ is not available \\citep{Pilyugin2011}. Now we\nconsider the calibration for such a case.  We will use the sulphur line\n$S_{2}$ intensity instead of the oxygen $R_{2}$ line intensity.  A\ncalibration of this type will be referred to as $S$ calibration, and\nthe oxygen abundance determined using this kind of calibration will be\nlabeled (O/H)$_{S}$.  The same form of the calibration relation as\nin Eq.~\\ref{equation:ohgeneral} is adopted. \n\nUsing the calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of the upper branch\n(log$N_{2} \\ge -0.6$), the following values of the coefficients\n$a_{j}$ were obtained: \n      $a_{1} =  8.424$,  \n      $a_{2} =  0.030$,\n      $a_{3} =  0.751$, \n      $a_{4} = -0.349$, \n      $a_{5} =  0.182$,\n      $a_{6} =  0.508$. \nThe corresponding calibration relation is  \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n       \\begin{array}{lll}\n     {\\rm (O/H)}^{*}_{S,U}  & = &   8.424 + 0.030 \\, \\log (R_{3}/S_{2}) + 0.751 \\, \\log N_{2}   \\\\  \n                          & + &  (-0.349 + 0.182 \\, \\log (R_{3}/S_{2}) + 0.508 \\log N_{2})   \\\\ \n                          & \\times & \\log S_{2}   \\\\ \n     \\end{array}\n\\label{equation:ohsu}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere (O/H)$^{*}_{S,U}$ = 12 +log(O/H)$_{S,U}$. \nUsing the calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of the lower branch \n(log$N_{2} < -0.6$), we obtained the following values for the \ncoefficients $a_{j}$: \n      $a_{1} =  8.072$,  \n      $a_{2} =  0.789$, \n      $a_{3} =  0.726$, \n      $a_{4} =  1.069$, \n      $a_{5} = -0.170$, \n      $a_{6} =  0.022$. \nThen\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n       \\begin{array}{lll}\n     {\\rm (O/H)}^{*}_{S,L}  & = &   8.072 + 0.789 \\, \\log (R_{3}/S_{2}) + 0.726 \\, \\log N_{2}   \\\\  \n                          & + &  (1.069 - 0.170 \\, \\log (R_{3}/S_{2}) + 0.022 \\log N_{2})    \\\\ \n                          & \\times & \\log S_{2}   \\\\ \n     \\end{array}\n\\label{equation:ohsl}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere (O/H)$^{*}_{S,L}$ = 12 +log(O/H)$_{S,L}$. \n\nPanel $b1$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh} shows the comparison between\nthe oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{S}$ and (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ for our sample\nof reference  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  The grey  points denote the values\nfor the individual H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  The dark points represent the\nmean oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{T_{e}}^{mean}$ and (O/H)$_{S}^{mean}$\nfor the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions in bins of 0.1 dex in (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$.  The\nbars show the absolute values of the mean difference between the\noxygen abundances (O/H)$_{S}$ and (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ for each bin.  The\nsolid line indicates equality.  The dashed lines show the $\\pm$0.1 dex\ndeviation from these equal values.  In panel $b2$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh} we plot the normalized histogram of the\ndifferences between the calibration-based oxygen abundances\n(O/H)$_{S}$ and the directly measued (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ values.\nInspection of panels $b1$ and $b2$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh} shows\nthat the difference between the oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{S}$ and\n(O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ is usually less than 0.1 dex.  The mean difference for\nour 313 calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions is 0.048 dex. \n\nPanel $c1$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh} shows the comparison between\nthe oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{S}$ and (O/H)$_{R}$ for our calibrating\ndata points.  Panel $c2$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh} shows the\nnormalized histogram of the differences between the oxygen abundances\n(O/H)$_{S}$ and (O/H)$_{R}$.  The panels $c1$ and $c2$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh} demonstrate that the $R$ and $S$ calibrations\nproduce oxygen abundance values that are very close to each other.\nThe mean difference for the 313 calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions\namounts to only 0.013 dex. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Two-dimensional $R$ and $S$ calibrations for the upper branch} \n\n\nThe calibration relations suggested above are three-dimensional, i.e.,\nthe calibration for the oxygen abundance determination involves three\nparameters: log($R_{3}/R_{2}$), log$N_{2}$, and log$R_{2}$, or\nlog($R_{3}/S_{2}$), log$N_{2}$, and log$S_{2}$. It was noted above\n(see Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte}) that there is a distinct dependence of\nthe oxygen abundance on the value of the excitation parameter $P$ at\nhigh electron temperatures (lower branch) and this dependence\ndisappears at low temperatures (upper branch).  Hence one may expect\nthat the dependence of the oxygen abundance on the value of the\nexcitation parameter $P$ can be neglected and two-dimensional\ncalibrations can be determined for the upper branch.  \n\nThe obtained two-dimensional $R$ relation for the upper branch is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n       \\begin{array}{lll}\n12+{\\rm (O/H)}_{R,2D}  & = &  8.589 + 0.329  \\, \\log N_{2}  \\\\  \n                      & + & (-0.205 + 0.549 \\, \\log N_{2}) \\times \\log R_{2}  \\\\ \n     \\end{array}\n\\label{equation:ohr1p}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe inferred two-dimensional $S$ relation for the upper branch is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n       \\begin{array}{lll}\n12+{\\rm (O/H)}_{S,2D}  & = &  8.445 + 0.699  \\, \\log N_{2}  \\\\  \n                      & + & (-0.253 + 0.217 \\, \\log N_{2}) \\times \\log S_{2}  \\\\ \n     \\end{array}\n\\label{equation:ohs1p}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nPanel $a1$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh2d} shows the comparison between\noxygen abundances for the calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions obtained\nthrough the three-dimensional calibration (O/H)$_{R}$ and through the\ntwo-dimensional calibration (O/H)$_{R,2D}$.  Panel $a2$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh2d} displays the normalized histogram of the\ndifferences between the oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{R,2D}$ and\n(O/H)$_{R}$.  The panels $b1$ and $b2$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh2d} show\na similar comparison between the oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{S}$ and\n(O/H)$_{S,2D}$.  Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh2d} demonstrates that\nthe two-dimensional and three-dimensional $R$ and $S$ calibrations\nproduce oxygen abundances for H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of the upper branch\nthat are in very good agreement with one another.\n\nThus, the oxygen abundances in high-metallicity H\\,{\\sc ii} regions\n(the upper branch) can be estimated using the intensities of only two\nlines, namely $R_{2}$ and $N_{2}$ (or $S_{2}$ and $N_{2}$).\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\resizebox{1.00\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=000]{Fig05.eps}}\n\\caption{Panel $a1$ shows the nitrogen abundance (N/H)$_{R}$ as a\nfunction of the nitrogen abundance (N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ for the calibrating\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions.

Fig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte}\nshows that the general behaviour of the nitrogen abundances in the\nconsidered diagrams is similar to that of the oxygen abundances. This\nsuggests that an expression of the same form as\nEq.~\\ref{equation:ohgeneral} can be adopted for the calibration\nrelation for the nitrogen abundance determinations. \n\nBased on the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of the upper branch \n(log$N_{2} \\ge -0.6$), the following values of the coefficients \n$a_j$ were obtained: \n      $a_{1} =  7.939$,  \n      $a_{2} =  0.135$,\n      $a_{3} =  1.217$, \n      $a_{4} = -0.765$, \n      $a_{5} =  0.166$,\n      $a_{6} =  0.449$. \nThe resulting calibration relation for the nitrogen abundance \ndetermination is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n       \\begin{array}{lll}\n     {\\rm (N/H)}^{*}_{R,U}  & = &   7.939 + 0.135 \\, \\log (R_{3}/R_{2}) + 1.217 \\, \\log N_{2}   \\\\  \n                          & + &  (-0.765 + 0.166 \\, \\log (R_{3}/R_{2}) + 0.449 \\log N_{2})   \\\\ \n                          & \\times & \\log R_{2}   \\\\ \n     \\end{array}\n\\label{equation:nhru}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere (N/H)$^{*}_{R,U}$ = 12 +log(N/H)$_{R,U}$. \n\nFor the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions on the lower branch (log$N_{2} < -0.6$), \nthe values of the coefficients are: \n      $a_{1} =  7.476$,  \n      $a_{2} =  0.879$,\n      $a_{3} =  1.451$, \n      $a_{4} = -0.011$, \n      $a_{5} = -0.327$,\n      $a_{6} = -0.064$,\nand the calibration relation is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n       \\begin{array}{lll}\n     {\\rm (N/H)}^{*}_{R,L}  & = &   7.476 + 0.879 \\, \\log (R_{3}/R_{2}) + 1.451 \\, \\log N_{2}   \\\\  \n                          & + &  (-0.011 - 0.327 \\, \\log (R_{3}/R_{2}) - 0.064 \\log N_{2})   \\\\ \n                          & \\times & \\log R_{2}   \\\\ \n     \\end{array}\n\\label{equation:nhrl}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere (N/H)$^{*}_{R,L}$ = 12 +log(N/H)$_{R,L}$.\n\nPanel $a1$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nhtenh} shows the comparison between\nthe nitrogen abundances (N/H)$_{R}$ and (N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ for our sample\nof calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.

The mean difference for\nthe 313 calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions is 0.031 dex. \n\nA comparison of the panels $a1$ and $a2$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh}\nwith the panels $a1$ and $a2$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nhtenh} shows that\nthe agreement between the $R$-calibration-based and the $T_{e}$-based\nnitrogen abundances is better than that for the oxygen abundances.\nIndeed, the mean difference (N/H)$_{R}$ -- (N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ is 0.031\ndex while the mean difference (O/H)$_{R}$ -- (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ is 0.049\ndex.  \n\nWe also constructed the $S$ calibration for the determination of the\nnitrogen abundances. However, the nitrogen abundances estimated with\nthe $S$ calibration are much more uncertain those produced by the $R$\ncalibration. Therefore we do not discuss the $S$ calibration for\nnitrogen abundance determinations here. \n\nAs in the case of oxygen, the two-dimensional $R$ calibration was\nconstructed for the high-metallicity  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions (upper\nbranch).

The comparison of the panels $a1$ and $a2$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:ohteoh2d} with the panels $b1$ and $b2$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:nhtenh} shows that the abundances produced by the\nthree- and two-dimensional $R$ calibrations agree better for oxygen\nthan for nitrogen.\n\nThus, the nitrogen abundance in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region can be obtained\nfrom the intensities of the strong emission lines $R_{2}$, $R_{3}$,\nand $N_{2}$ in its spectrum. Those abundances agree with the directly\nmeasured nitrogen abundances within $\\sim 0.1$ dex. The nitrogen\nabundances in high-metallicity H\\,{\\sc ii} regions (the upper branch)\ncan also be estimated using the intensities of the two strong lines\n$R_{2}$ and $N_{2}$ only.\n\n\n\\subsection{Calibration relation for determinations of the N/O ratio}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\resizebox{1.00\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=000]{Fig06.eps}}\n\\caption{\nPanel $a$.

The N/O -- $N_{2}/R_{2}$ relations for different subsamples\nare shifted relative each to other and have different slopes.  We \nderived the following calibration relation for the total sample: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n       \\begin{array}{lll}\n\\log {\\rm (N/O)}  & = &  -0.657 - 0.201 \\, \\log N_{2}  \\\\  \n                  & + & (0.742 -0.075 \\, \\log N_{2}) \\times \\log(N_{2}/R_{2})  \\\\ \n     \\end{array}\n\\label{equation:nolin}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe lines in panel $a$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nolin} show the\ncalibration relation for different values of the intensity of the \n$N_{2}$ line.\n\nPanel $b$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nolin} shows the nitrogen-to-oxygen\nabundance ratio (N/O)$_{calibr}$ derived from the calibration relation\n(Eq.~\\ref{equation:nolin}) as a function of the nitrogen-to-oxygen\nabundance ratio (N/O)$_{T_{e}}$ for the calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions.  The grey points mark individual H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  We\nagain split our sample of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions into bins of 0.1 dex in\nthe (N/O)$_{T_{e}}$ abundance ratio.  We determined the mean\nnitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O)$_{T_{e}}^{mean}$ and\n(N/O)$_{calibr}^{mean}$ for the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions in each bin.  The\nabsolute values of the mean difference between (N/O)$_{calibr}$ and\n(N/O)$_{T_{e}}$ were estimated for each bin using\nEq.~\\ref{equation:meandif}.  Those mean values are shown in the panel\n$b$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nolin} by the dark points while the bars show\nthe absolute values of the mean difference between the\nnitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O)$_{calibr}$ and\n(N/O)$_{T_{e}}$ for each bin.  The solid line is that of equal values,\nthe dashed lines show the $\\pm$0.1 dex deviations from the unity line.\n\nPanel $c$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nolin} shows the normalized histogram of\nthe differences between the N/O ratios derived from the calibration\nrelation (Eq.~\\ref{equation:nolin}) and through the $T_{e}$ method for\nour calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions. \n\nAbove, we constructed the calibration relations for the\ndetermination of the nitrogen and oxygen abundances.  If the nitrogen\nand oxygen abundances are estimated separately then the\nnitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio can be easily obtained.  Let us\ncompare the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio (N/O)$_{calibr}$\ndetermined immediately from the corresponding calibration relation\n(Eq.~\\ref{equation:nolin}) and the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio\n(N/O)$_{R}$ obtained from the nitrogen (N/H)$_{R}$ and oxygen\n(O/H)$_{R}$ abundances determined separately from the corresponding\nrelations (Eqs.~\\ref{equation:ohru}, \\ref{equation:ohrl} for the\noxygen abundances and Eqs. \\ref{equation:nhru}, \\ref{equation:nhrl}\nfor the nitrogen abundances).  Panel $d$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nolin}\nshows the comparison between the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio\n(N/O)$_{calibr}$ and (N/O)$_{R}$.  \n\nInspection of Fig.~\\ref{figure:nolin} suggests that the N/O abundance\nratio in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region estimated from the intensities of the\ntwo strong emission lines $N_{2}$ and $R_{2}$ agrees with the directly\nmeasured N/O abundance ratio within $\\sim$0.05 dex for the bulk of our\nreference H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  The mean difference between the N/O\nabundance ratios obtained from Eq.~\\ref{equation:nolin} and through\nthe $T_{e}$ method is 0.026 dex for our 313 calibrating data points. \nThe values of the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio (N/O)$_{calibr}$\ndetermined directly from the corresponding calibration relation and\nthe nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio (N/O)$_{R}$ obtained from \nnitrogen (N/H)$_{R}$ and oxygen (O/H)$_{R}$ abundances determined\nseparately are also close to each other.  This suggests that our\ncalibration relations are self-consistent.  \n\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusions}\n\n\nIn this study, we derived simple relations (calibrations) between the\noxygen (nitrogen) abundance in H\\,{\\sc ii} regions using the\nintensities of the strong lines in their spectra.  These relations can\nbe applied to derive nebular abundances from spectroscopic\nmeasurements that do not permit the use of the direct method for\nabundance determinations.  The choice of more sophisticated\nexpressions may result in an even better agreement between the\ncalibration-based and the directly measured abundances. However, the\nabundances produced by the suggested calibrations agree with the\nmeasured abundances to within about 0.1 dex, which is comparable with\nthe expected range of uncertainties in the directly measured\nabundances of the calibrating H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  Therefore, one can\nexpect that a significant increase of the precision of the\ncalibration-based abundances can only be provided by a calibration\nbased on a sample of reference H\\,{\\sc ii} regions that is larger in\nquantity and/or higher in the quality of the abundance determinations\nthrough the direct $T_{e}$-based method as compared to the sample used\nhere.  For that purpose, new high precision measurements of H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions would be needed. \n\nIn the following we discuss the properties and validity of the\nsuggested calibrations. \n\n\n\\subsection{The transition between the upper and lower branches}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\resizebox{1.00\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=000]{Fig07.eps}}\n\\caption{Comparison of the abundances in H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with\nlog$N_{2}$ near the boundary value obtained through the calibration\nrelations for the upper and lower branches.

H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions with log$N_{2} \\ge -0.6$ are assumed to belong to the upper\nbranch and objects with log$N_{2} < -0.6$ to the lower branch. This\nseparation criterium was inferred from the examination of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:ln2xhte} and is somewhat arbitrary.  It is important\nthat the abundances produced by the calibrations for the lower and\nupper branches are compatible with each other in the boundary region\nseparating the ranges of their applicability.  Indeed, two H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions located close to the dividing line on both sides have similar\nabundances.  Therefore, the abundance resulting from the lower branch\ncalibration in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region located on the one side of the\nboundary line should be close to the abundance produced by the upper\nbranch calibration in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region located on the other side \nof the dividing line.  Is this the case? \n\n\nWe now consider H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with nitrogen line $N_{2}$\nintensities near the adopted boundary value, with intensities from\nlog$N_{2} = -0.9$ to $-0.3$. As a test, the abundances in\nthose H\\,{\\sc ii} regions were obtained both with the calibration\nrelations for the upper branch and for the lower branch. The filled\ngrey circles in panel $a$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:boundary} show the\ndifferences between the oxygen abundance estimated from the $R$\ncalibration for the upper branch and the direct $T_{e}$-based oxygen\nabundance (O/H)$_{R,U}$ -- (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ as a function of the\nnitrogen line $N_{2}$ intensity. The plus signs show the differences\nbetween the oxygen abundance estimated from the $R$ calibration for\nthe lower branch and the direct $T_{e}$-based oxygen abundance\n(O/H)$_{R,L}$ -- (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ for the same objects. The solid\nvertical line shows the adopted boundary dividing the ranges of the\napplicability of the lower and upper branch calibration relations. The\ndashed vertical lines indicate the interval in log$N_{2}$ where both\nrelations produce rather close abundances.  Panel $a$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:boundary} shows that the $R$ calibration for the\nupper branch provides rather accurate oxygen abundances for objects\nwith log$N_{2}$ below the adopted limit, up to log$N_{2} \\sim -0.7$.\nIn turn, the $R$ calibration for the lower branch results in fairly\naccurate oxygen abundances for objects with log$N_{2}$ higher than the\nadopted limit, up to log$N_{2} \\sim -0.45$, with a few exceptions. The\nranges of applicability of the $R$ calibration relations for the\noxygen abundance determinations overlap in the range from log$N_{2}\n\\sim -0.7$ to $-0.45$.  The dashed vertical lines show the interval in\nlog$N_{2}$ where both relations produce abundances that are in close\nagreement.\n\nPanel $b$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:boundary} shows the difference\n(O/H)$_{S,U}$ -- (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ and (O/H)$_{S,L}$ -- (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$\nas a function of the  $N_{2}$ nitrogen line intensity. The ranges of\napplicability of the $S$ calibration relations for the oxygen\nabundance determinations also overlap.  Panel $c$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:boundary} shows the difference (N/H)$_{R,U}$ --\n(N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ and (N/H)$_{R,L}$ -- (N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ as a function of\nthe $N_{2}$ nitrogen line intensity. Again, the ranges of\napplicability of the $R$ calibration relations for the nitrogen \nabundance determinations overlap.\n\nThus, the calibrations for the lower and upper branches are compatible\nwith each other in the boundary regime dividing the ranges of their\napplicability.  Moreover, the ranges of their applicability overlap.\nIn practice, H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with $N_{2}$ nitrogen line intensities\nnear the adopted boundary value can be misclassified due to errors in\nthe $N_{2}$ measurements.  The H\\,{\\sc ii} regions that truly belong\nto the upper branch with underestimated  $N_{2}$ nitrogen line\nintensities can be classified as objects of the lower branch and vice\nversa.  However, since the ranges of the applicability of the lower\nand upper branch calibration relations overlap the error in the\nabundance due to the misclassification of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions is not\nlarge.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Verification of the calibrations: abundances in a large \nsample of  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions }\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\resizebox{1.00\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=000]{Fig08.eps}}\n\\caption{The application of the suggested calibrations to a large\nsample of 3454 spectra of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions in spiral and irregular\ngalaxies.

The $R_{2}$, $R_{3}$, $N_{2}$, and\n$S_{2}$ line intensity measurements are available in 3454 spectra of\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  Those data provide an additional possibility to\ntest the validity of the abundances produced by the suggested\ncalibrations.\n\nPanel $a$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:r23oh} shows the $S$-calibration-based\noxygen abundances (O/H)$_{S}$ as a function of $R$-calibration-based\noxygen abundances (O/H)$_{R}$ for the compiled sample of H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions.  The grey points stand for individual H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.\nThe dark points represent the mean abundances for objects in bins with\nsizes of 0.1 dex in (O/H)$_{R}$.  The error bars show the mean value\nof the differences between (O/H)$_{S}$ and (O/H)$_{R}$ in the H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions within each bin.  Objects with large absolute values of\nthe difference between (O/H)$_{S}$ and (O/H)$_{R}$ abundances (i.e.,\nlarger than 0.2 dex) were excluded in the determinations of the mean\nvalues of the abundance and mean values of the abundance differences.\nThe solid diagonal line represents equality; the dashed lines show\n$\\pm$0.1 dex offsets from equal values.  Panel $b$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:r23oh} displays the normalized histogram of the\ndifferences between the (O/H)$_{S}$ and (O/H)$_{R}$ abundances.  The\npanels $a$ and $b$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:r23oh} demonstrate that the\n(O/H)$_{S}$ and the (O/H)$_{R}$ abundances agree with each other\nwithin $\\sim 0.05$ dex for the majority of the  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.\nIt should be emphasized the value of 0.05 dex cannot be interpreted as\nthe precision of the abundance determinations with our calibration\nrelations.  The uncertainties in the $R_{3}$ and $N_{2}$ line\nmeasurements can introduce similar errors in the (O/H)$_{R}$ and\n(O/H)$_{S}$ abundances.  Therefore, this abundance uncertainty cannot\nbe revealed through the comparison between (O/H)$_{R}$ and (O/H)$_{S}$\nabundances.  \n\nThe O/H vs.\\ $R_{23}$ diagram is a well-studied diagnostic diagram.\nThis diagram was used to construct calibrations for oxygen abundance\ndeterminations by numerous investigators\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Edmunds1984,Dopita1986,McGaugh1991,Zaritsky1994,Pilyugin2000,Pilyugin2001a,Pilyugin2005}.\nPanel $c$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:r23oh} shows the O/H -- $R_{23}$\ndiagram. The grey points indicate the (O/H)$_{R}$ abundances for our\nsample of compiled H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  The dark squares mark the\n(O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ abundances for the calibrating data points.  The\nobjects with calibration-based (O/H)$_{R}$ abundances follow closely\nthe trend traced by objects with direct (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ abundances. \n\nThe N/O vs.\\ O/H diagram can be also used to test the validity of the\noxygen and nitrogen abundances produced by the suggested calibrations.\nMany studies are devoted to the investigation of the N/O -- O/H\ndiagram \\citep[][among many\nothers]{Edmunds1978,Izotov1999,Henry2000,Pilyugin2003,Pilyugin2004,Berg2012,Annibali2015}.\nPanel $d$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:r23oh} shows the N/O -- O/H diagram.\nThe grey points mark the (X/H)$_{R}$ abundances for our compiled\nsample.  The dark squares show the (X/H)$_{T_{e}}$ abundances for the\ncalibrating data points.  Again, the objects with $R$-based abundances\nfollow closely the trend traced by objects with direct $T_{e}$-based\nabundances.  It is commonly accepted that the break in the N/O -- O/H\ndiagram is caused by fact that since 12 +log(O/H) $\\ga 8.2$, secondary\nnitrogen becomes dominant and the nitrogen abundance increases at a\nfaster rate than the oxygen abundance \\citep{Henry2000}.  The scatter\nin the N/O -- O/H diagram can be caused by the time delay between\nnitrogen and oxygen enrichment, the local enrichment in nitrogen by\nWolf-Rayet stars, and by enriched galactic winds\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Edmunds1978,Pilyugin1992,Pilyugin1993,Henry2000,LopezSanchez2010,PilyuginThuan2011,Tsujimoto2013,MirallesCaballero2014}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Verification of the calibrations: abundance gradients in \nthe galaxy M~101}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\resizebox{1.00\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=000]{Fig09.eps}}\n\\caption{Panel $a$.

First, the auroral lines were\nmeasured in the spectra of a number of its H\\,{\\sc ii} regions and,\nconsequently, the abundances in those H\\,{\\sc ii} regions could be\nderived through the direct $T_{e}$ method.  This provides a possibility\nto compare the abundances produced by empirical calibrations with\nthese direct abundances, i.e., in some sense the galaxy M~101 can be\nconsidered as a ``Rosetta stone''.  Second, the oxygen abundances of\nthe H\\,{\\sc ii} regions of M~101 cover a large range of abundances\nspanning approximately an order of magnitude.  This provides a\npossibility to test the validity of our calibrations over the large\nrange of abundances.  Here we use emission-line measurements in 142\nspectra of  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions in M~101 taken from\n\\citet{Hawley1978,SedwickAller1981,Rayo1982,Skillman1985,TorresPeimbert1989,KinkelRosa1994,\nGarnettKennicutt1994,KennicuttGarnett1996,vanZee1998,Luridiana2002,Kennicutt2003,Bresolin2007,Esteban2009,LiBresolin2013}.\nIt should be noted that the number of spectra is larger than the\nnumber of measured H\\,{\\sc ii} regions because some H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions were measured several times.  \n\nPanel $a$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:m101} shows the radial distributions of\nthe $T_{e}$-based (plus signs) and $R$-calibration-based (circles)\noxygen abundances across the disk of the galaxy M~101.  The solid line\nshows the linear best fit (O/H)$_{R}$ = $f$($R_{G}$) to the objects\nwithin the optical radius $R_{25}$.  The dotted line is the\nextrapolation of the best fit beyond the optical radius.  Panel $a$ of\nFig.~\\ref{figure:m101} shows that the radial distribution of the\n$R$-calibration-based oxygen abundances follows that of the\n$T_{e}$-based abundances very well.  The radial distributions of the\noxygen abundances within and beyond the optical radius (up to $\\sim\n1.3 R_{25}$) can be described by the unique (O/H)$_{R}$ -- $R_{G}$\nrelation. \n\nPanel $b$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:m101} shows the radial distributions of\nthe oxygen (O/H)$_{S}$ (circles) and (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ (plus signs)\nabundances.  The grey (blue) dashed line is the linear best fit\n(O/H)$_{S}$ = $f$($R_{G}$) to the objects within the optical radius\n$R_{25}$, and the dotted line is its extrapolation beyond the optical\nradius.  For comparison, the best fit to the (O/H)$_{R}$ abundances is\nalso shown by the solid line (from panel $a$).  The (O/H)$_{S}$ --\n$R_{G}$ relation is very close to the (O/H)$_{R}$ -- $R_{G}$ relation;\nin fact they coincide with each other. \n\nPanel $c$ of Fig.~\\ref{figure:m101} shows the radial distributions of\nthe nitrogen (N/H)$_{R}$ (circles) and (N/H)$_{T_{e}}$ (plus signs)\nabundances.  The solid line is the linear best fit (N/H)$_{R} =\nf(R_{G}$) to the objects with galactocentric distances less than $0.7\nR_{25}$, and the dotted line is its extrapolation beyond this radius.\nAs in the case of the oxygen abundances, the radial distribution of\nthe $R$-calibration-based nitrogen abundances follows those of the\n$T_{e}$-based nitrogen abundances well.  In contrast to the oxygen\nabundance, however, the radial distribution of the nitrogen abundances\nshows a break at $\\sim$0.7$R_{25}$ (it is difficult to derive the\nexact value of the break radius because of the scatter in the nitrogen\nabundance at a given galactocentric distance).  The slope of the radial\ndistribution of the nitrogen abundances beyond this radius becomes\nshallower.  This is not surprising.  As we noted above, since 12\n+log(O/H) $\\ga 8.2$, secondary nitrogen becomes dominant and the\nnitrogen abundance increases at a faster rate than the oxygen\nabundance. \n\n\n\\subsection{On the metallicity scale for H\\,{\\sc ii} regions}\n\n\nFor the sake of clarity we will briefly discuss the validity and\nreliability of the oxygen abundances. The validity and reliability of\nthe calibration-based abundances can be addressed on three levels.\nFirstly, the accuracy of the calibration relations depend on the\nnumber and quality of the calibrating data points.\nFig.~\\ref{figure:gistxhe} shows that the number of the reference\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions at high metallicities is relatively small. As was\nnoted earlier, new high precision measurements of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions,\nespecially at high metallicities, would be desirable to increase the\nreliability of the calibration-based abundances.  The abundances in\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions provided by the suggested calibration relations\nare in agreement with the $T_{e}$-based abundances within 0.1 dex,\ni.e., the relative accuracy of the calibration-based abundances are\nwithin 0.1 dex.  There is no systematic discrepancy between\ncalibration-based and $T_{e}$-based abundances. Therefore, the\nvalidity of the absolute calibration-based abundances (the potential\nsystematic error) is, in fact, determined by the validity of the\n$T_{e}$-based metallicity scale for H\\,{\\sc ii} regions. \n\nSecondly, there is a discrepancy between the values of the abundance\nof a given H\\,{\\sc ii} region derived through the $T_{e}$ method and\nvia the model fitting using the same collisionally excited lines (see\nreferences in Section 1).  \nThe validity and reliability of abundances obtained both\nthrough model fitting as well as through the $T_{e}$ method can be \nquestioned. On the one hand, it is pertinent to quote a passage from a\nreview paper written by an H\\,{\\sc ii} region modeller\n\\citet{Stasinska2004}:  ``A widely spread opinion is that\nphotoionization model fitting provides the most accurate abundances.\nThis would be true if the constraints were sufficiently numerous (not\nonly on emission line ratios, but also on the stellar content and on\nthe nebular gas distribution) and if the model fit were perfect (with\na photoionization code treating correctly all the relevant physical\nprocesses and using accurate atomic data). These conditions are never\nmet in practice.'' On the other hand, there are a number of factors\nthat can affect $T_{e}$-based abundance determinations.  It should be\nstressed that the underlying logic of the classical $T_{e}$ method is\nirreproachable.  However, the practical realization of the $T_{e}$\nmethod relies on some assumptions that can be questioned.  Indeed, the\nequations of the $T_{e}$ method correlate the intensities of the\nemission lines with the electron temperature and abundances within a\nvolume with constant conditions (electron temperature and chemical\ncomposition). In reality, possible spatial variations of the physical\nconditions inside an H\\,{\\sc ii} region can affect the $T_{e}$-based\nabundance determinations. \n\nThirdly, usually collisionally excited lines are used for the\ndetermination of the electron temperature and abundance in H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions, e.g., in the $T_{e}$ method.  The electron temperature of an\nH\\,{\\sc ii} region can be also derived from the Balmer (or Paschen)\njump \\citep{Peimbert1967}, whereas the abundance of an H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregion can also be determined from optical recombination lines.\n\\citet{Guseva2006} and \\citet{Guseva2007} determined the Balmer and/or\nPaschen jump temperatures in a large sample of low-metallicity (12 +\nlog(O/H) $\\la 8.36$) H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  They found that the\ntemperatures of the O$^{++}$ zones determined through the equation of\nthe $T_{e}$ method (from collisionally excited lines) do not differ,\nin a statistical sense, from the temperatures of the H$^{+}$ zones\ndetermined from the Balmer and Paschen jumps although small\ntemperature differences of the order of 3\\%--5\\% cannot be ruled out.\nThe O$^{++}$ abundances obtained from the optical recombination lines\nare systematically higher (by a factor of 1.3 -- 3) than the ones\ndetermined through the equation of the $T_{e}$ method from\ncollisionally excited lines \\citep[][and references\ntherein]{GarciaRojas2007,Esteban2014}.   \n\nDifferent hypotheses were used to explain the discrepancy between the\nabundances determined from the collisionally excited lines and from\nthe optical recombination lines.  \\citet{Peimbert1967} assumed that\nthe temperature field within the  H\\,{\\sc ii} region is not uniform\nbut that there are instead the small-scale spatial temperature\nfluctuations inside an H\\,{\\sc ii} region. If they are important then\nthe (O/H)$_{T_{e}}$ abundance would be a lower limit and the\nabundances determined from the optical recombination lines remain\nunaltered.  \\citet{Tsamis2005} suggest a dual-abundance model\nincorporating small-scale chemical inhomogeneities in the form of\nhydrogen-deficient inclusions.  Neither abundances determined from the\ncollisionally excited lines nor from the optical recombination lines\nare reliable in this case.  \\citet{Nicholls2012} and\n\\citet{Dopita2013} argue that the energy distribution of electrons in\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions does not follow a Maxwell distribution.  In this\ncase, abundances determined from optical recombination lines are more\nreliable. \n\nThus, at the present time there is no absolute scale for the\nmetallicities of H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  Until the problem of the\ndiscrepancy between the abundances determined in different ways is\nresolved, doubts about the validity and reliability of the\n$T_{e}$-based (and any other) metallicity scale will remain. If at\nsome point irrefutable proof will be established that the\n$T_{e}$-based abundances should be adjusted then our calibration\nrelations should be also reconsidered. \n\nFinally, it should be noted that the $T_{e}$ method (and,\nconsequently, our calibrations) produces the gas-phase oxygen\nabundance in H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  Some fraction of oxygen may be\nembedded in dust grains.  \\citet{Peimbert2010} have concluded that the\ndepletion of the oxygen abundance in H\\,{\\sc ii} regions can be around\n0.1 dex increasing from $\\sim 0.08$ dex in low-metallicity  H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions to $\\sim 0.12$ dex in high-metallicity  H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions.  When this effect is taken into account the total (gas +\ndust) oxygen abundance in an H\\,{\\sc ii} region is higher by $\\sim\n0.1$ dex than the one produced by the $T_{e}$ method and our\ncalibrations.\n\n\n\\section {Summary}\n\n\n\nWe derive simple expressions relating the oxygen abundance in H\\,{\\sc\nii} regions with the intensities of the three strong lines $R_{2}$,\n$R_{3}$, and $N_{2}$ ($R$ calibrations) or $S_{2}$, $R_{3}$, and\n$N_{2}$ ($S$ calibration). We also present the $R$ calibration for\nnitrogen abundance determinations.  We use a sample of 313 reference\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions with $T_{e}$-based oxygen abundances obtained\noriginally for the counterpart method ($C$ method) as a sample of\ncalibrating data points. \n\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions are usually divided in two classes: the\nhigh-metallicity objects (the ``upper branch'') and low-metallicity\nobjects (the ``lower branch'').  We adopt a value of log$N_{2} = -0.6$\nas boundary between the upper and lower branches.  In other words,\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions with log$N_{2} \\ge -0.6$ belong to the upper\nbranch and H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with  log$N_{2} < -0.6$ are lower\nbranch objects.  We derive different calibration relations for the\nabundance determinations in H\\,{\\sc ii} regions on the lower and upper\nbranches.  The ranges of the applicability of the calibration\nrelations for the upper and lower branches overlap in the boundary\nregion within a range of $-0.7 \\la$ log$N_{2} \\la -0.45$. \n\nThe oxygen and nitrogen abundances estimated through the calibrations\nagree with the $T_{e}$-based abundances within $\\sim 0.1$ dex over the\nwhole metallicity range of  H\\,{\\sc ii} regions, i.e., the\nrelative accuracy of the calibration-based abundances is 0.1 dex. The\noxygen and nitrogen abundances in the high-metallicity  H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions (upper branch) can be estimated using only the intensities of\nthe two strong lines $R_{2}$ and $N_{2}$ (or $S_{2}$ and $N_{2}$ for\noxygen). \n\nThe validity of the suggested calibrations was tested using a\ncompilation of more than three thousand spectra of H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregions.  The locations of the calibration-based abundances in those\nH\\,{\\sc ii} regions in the $R_{23}$ -- O/H and the N/O -- O/H digrams\nfollow well the general trends traced by H\\,{\\sc ii} regions with\n$T_{e}$-based abundances.  Also, the radial distributions of the\ncalibration-based oxygen and nitrogen abundances across the disk of\nthe well-studied galaxy M~101 follow those of the $T_{e}$-based\nabundances. \n\nWe emphasize that there are two important advantages of our new\ncalibrations in comparison to the existing ones. Firstly, in our\napproach, the oxygen abundances (O/H)$_{R}$ and (O/H)$_{S}$ --\nproduced by two different calibrations (based on different sets of\nstrong emission lines) -- agree within $\\sim 0.05$ dex for the\nmajority of the H\\,{\\sc ii} regions.  \nIt should be noted that the value of 0.05 dex cannot be interpreted as\nthe accuracy of the abundance determinations through our calibration\nrelations.  Uncertainties in the  $R_{3}$ and $N_{2}$ line\nmeasurements can introduce similar errors in the (O/H)$_{R}$ and\n(O/H)$_{S}$ abundances.  Therefore, such uncertainties in the\nabundance cannot be revealed through the comparison between\n(O/H)$_{R}$ and (O/H)$_{S}$ abundances.  Secondly, \nsince the ranges applicability of the calibration relations for the \nupper and lower branches overlap the problem with the abundance\ndeterminations in the ``transition'' zone does not appear.   \n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nWe are grateful to the referee, Prof.\\ M.A.~Dopita, for his \nconstructive comments. \\\\\nL.S.P.\\ and E.K.G.\\ acknowledge support in the framework of\nSonderforschungsbereich SFB 881 on ``The Milky Way System'' (especially\nsubproject A5), which is funded by the German Research Foundation\n(DFG). \\\\ \nL.S.P.\\ thanks for the hospitality of the Astronomisches\nRechen-Institut at Heidelberg University  where part of this\ninvestigation was carried out. \\\\\nThis work was partly funded by the subsidy allocated to Kazan Federal\nUniversity for the state assignment in the sphere of scientific\nactivities (L.S.P.).  \\\\ \n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem [Alloin et al.(1979)]{Alloin1979} \n          Alloin D., Collin-Souffrin S., Joly M., Vigroux L., 1979, A\\&A, 78, 200\n\n\\bibitem [Andrievsky et al.(2002)]{Andrievsky2002} \n         Andrievsky S.~M., Kovtyukh V.~V., Luck R.~E., L\\'{e}pine J.R.D., Maciel W.J., Beletsky Y.V.,  2002, \\aap, 392, 491 \n\n\tAndrievsky, S.
