At very high energies the speed of the shrinkage of the diffraction cone increases due to the stronger screening of the amplitude in the centre of the disc, at small impact parameters. Asymptotically, in the black disc limit, where the total cross section grows as ln$^2 s$, the slope $B_{\\rm el}(s)$ also increases as ln$^2s$.  It was shown \\cite{SChMGR}\nthat indeed the high energy LHC data indicate the presence of a ln$^2 s$ component in the elastic slope which is consistent with the growth of the total cross section.\nHowever if we consider an individual ladder then the effective value of $\\alpha'_P$ in the ladder even decreases with energy due to the larger available $k_t$ space for the intermediate partons.  It is known that $\\alpha'_P\\to 0$ in the BFKL case.  Another example is the Monte Carlo description of multiparticle production. In order to tune the generator to the high energy data one has to introduce an infrared cutoff, $k_t^{\\rm min}$ whose value grows as $s^{0.12}$  \\cite{Pythia} -- that is, the transverse size of the ladder decreases.\n\nThus the interaction of two high energy protons should be described by a diagram like Fig.1(c) in which the size of each individual ladder is rather small (as seen from the small value of $\\alpha'_P$). Yet the separation between the ladders is of the order of the radius of the interaction amplitude which should be correlated with the total value of $B_{\\rm el}(s)$.   With increasing energy we expect the transverse size of an individual ladder (measured in the central rapidity interval) will decrease (as indicated by the behaviour of $k_t^{\\rm min}(s)$).  On the other hand the separation between the ladders is expected to increase, as indicated by the behaviour of $B_{\\rm el}(s)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Two components in Bose-Einstein correlations}\nHaving the above picture in mind, we expect in BEC to observe a new object -- a small-size pion source. In other words, BEC should be described by two different radii.\nOne radius corresponds to the case when both pions are emitted from the same ladder -- this will measure the size of an individual `pomeron'. Since the pion is not a point-like object the radius will be smeared out by fluctuations in the process of the formation of the pions.  The second radius will correspond to the pions being emitted from two different ladders -- it is a measure of the separation between the ladders.\nTherefore we propose to fit the observed correlation $R(Q)$ by a formula with two different mean radii\\footnote{Instead of the linear exponents, as in (\\ref{eq:RQ2}), other parametric forms may be considered for each term. For example, the second term may be a Gaussian, $e^{-({\\bar r_2} Q)^2}$.

In general there may be more pomerons in the whole amplitude, but only one ladder radiates the secondaries.  As the multiplicity becomes larger the secondaries are mainly emitted from a few different ladders, and the probability to find the two identical pions originating from the same pomeron decreases.  That is, we expect the relative contribution $\\lambda$ of the large component (described by, say, ${\\bar r_1}$) to increase with $N_{\\rm ch}$, while on the other hand, the strength of the small size component $(1-\\lambda)$ decreases.\nUnfortunately we cannot predict that $\\lambda \\to 0$ as $N_{\\rm ch}\\to 0$, and that $\\lambda \\to 1$ for very large $N_{\\rm ch}$.\nThe situation is complicated by the strong fluctuations of the number of secondaries in each ladder (or pomeron). Recall that actually we do not measure the total charged multiplicity of an event, but rather the number of secondaries in a limited central rapidity interval (like $|\\eta|<2.5$ in the case of ATLAS and CMS). Then the multiplicity corresponding to one pomeron is relatively small ($N_{\\rm ch}\\sim 4$) and the fluctuations strongly wash out the relation between the measured values and the number of cut pomerons.\nMoreover for very low $N_{\\rm ch}$ we may sample contributions from diffractive dissociation which have a qualitatively different structure.  Nevertheless at large $N_{\\rm ch}$ the multipomeron contribution dominates; that is BEC are driven mainly by the component with the largest radius, ${\\bar r}_1$. Indeed it is seen in Fig.~3(b) of \\cite{ATLAS} that, in the {\\it one} radius fit, (\\ref{eq:RQ1}), the radius increases with multiplicity reaching {\\it saturation} of ${\\bar r}\\simeq 2$fm for $N_{\\rm ch}{\\lower .7ex\\hbox{$\\;\\stackrel{\\textstyle                                                     >}{\\sim}\\;$}} 50$.  \n\nSuch saturation was predicted in \\cite{SKMR}, where it was explained that the radius measured in a one-radius fit, is driven, not by the initial energy, but mainly by the number of cut pomerons, $n_P \\propto N_{\\rm ch}$. Indeed, the radius of the individual \npomeron depends weakly on energy ($\\alpha'_P\\simeq$ const.), \nwhile the number of cut pomerons observed in the event (that is the separated pion sources) is \nproportional to $N_{\\rm  ch}$. So the probability to have two identical pions from two different sources increases with $N_{\\rm ch}$.\nWhen $n_p=1$ (at low $N_{\\rm ch}$) we observe one pomeron and measure its radius. On the other hand, for large $N_{\\rm ch}$ we \nstudy the separation between the pomerons and the value of ${\\bar r}$ is saturated at the radius of the interaction amplitude ${\\bar r} \\propto \\sqrt{B_{\\rm el}(s)}$. It was shown in \\cite{SKMR} that $B_{\\rm el}\\sim 20$ GeV$^{-2}$ \\cite{Totem} corresponds in a `one-radius' fit to ${\\bar r}=2.2$fm, which is in good agreement with Fig.~3(b) of the ATLAS fit \\cite{ATLAS}. \n\nWe emphasize that the separation between the pomerons (the pion sources) is not equal to the incoming hadron (proton) radius. First note, the radius corresponding to the interaction amplitude is larger. It increases with energy.  Recall that in each successive step of the ladder in Fig.~1 \nthe impact parameter changes by $\\Delta b_t$. This leads to a diffusion in $b_t$, which results in the second (or $\\alpha'_p$) term in the equation for the elastic slope, (\\ref{eq:slope}).  Next, the pion is not a point-like particle and its formation also occupies some volume.  Finally, there may be an interaction between the final state secondaries.\n\n\nStrictly speaking the picture that we describe above corresponds to the initial stage of the interaction, and does not allow for possible final state rescattering. If there are final state interactions (either in terms of a hadron gas or a quark-gluon plasma) then BEC will measure the radius given by the point of the last interaction -- that is, the domain occupied by secondaries is extended up to the stage where the particle density becomes so low that further interaction is very unlikely, and the size of the domain at which the last interaction occurs will be seen in BEC.   The probability of final state rescattering increases with particle density $N_{\\rm ch}$. If this contribution were to dominate, then it is natural to expect ${\\bar r} \\propto (N_{\\rm ch})^{1/3}$. However, the data of Fig. 3(b) of \\cite{ATLAS} do not show any evidence of such a behaviour for large $N_{\\rm ch}$. \n\nSo what are the expectations of the `two-radii' fit?  The contribution of small raduis dominates at low $N_{\\rm ch}$ and decreases with increasing $N_{\\rm ch}$ \\cite{SKMR}.  The value of the small radius, ${\\bar r}_2$, is almost independent of energy -- there is a small tendency to decrease due to a larger $k_t$ in the ladder (see, for example \\cite{KMRkt}).  On the other hand, the strength of the ${\\bar r}_1$ component increases with $N_{\\rm ch}$ -- the value of the radius, ${\\bar r}_1$, correlated with $B_{\\rm el}$ (that is, the radius of interaction of the incoming protons) slowly increases with energy. At asymptotic energies we expect \n$B_{\\rm el} \\propto {\\rm ln}^2 s$. A tendency already seen in LHC data \\cite{SChMGR}. Therefore for $s\\to \\infty$ we expect ${\\bar r}_1 \\propto c~$ln$s$. However, the coefficient $c$ is numerically quite small.\n\nFor very large $N_{\\rm ch}$ the value or ${\\bar r}_1$ may additionally increase due to the final state rescattering, as was discussed above. However it is not seen in the 7 TeV $pp$ collision data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{The $k_t$ dependence of BEC}\nHere we discuss the dependence of the radii, ${\\bar r}_1,~{\\bar r}_2$, on the transverse momentum of the identical pair, $k_t=(p_1+p_2)_t/2$,   First, we make a trivial remark --- for larger $k_t$ we have better space resolution in implementing the BEC method.  At low $k_t$ it may be hard to distinguish between ${\\bar r}_1$ and ${\\bar r}_2$ components, since the radii ${\\bar r}_1$ and ${\\bar r}_2$ will be larger than that measured at large $k_t$ due to uncertainty principle smearing, and thus closer to each other.\n\nRecall that the probability to produce two large $k_t$ pions from differents ladders (pomerons) decreases with increasing $k_t$ as the single particle inclusive cross section decreases steeply with $k_t$. That is, two identical pions, each with large $k_t$, should be produced from the same large $k_t$ jet.  So with increasing $k_t$ of the pair we expect a large contribution from the ${\\bar r}_2$ component with the value of ${\\bar r}_2$ decreasing, reaching saturation corresponding to the jet size. To be more precise, we mean the size of pion formation due to the hadronization of large $k_t$ jets. This tendency of ${\\bar r}$ to decrease with increasing $k_t$ was indeed observed in a `one-radii' fit of LHC data, see Figs. ~5,6 of \\cite{ATLAS}.  However, the value of $k_t$ was not sufficiently large to see saturation in these plots.\n\nAnother effect at very large $k_t$, which may give an important contribution to large $N_{\\rm ch}$ events, concerns the multiplicity of jets which increase as exp$(-c\\sqrt{{\\rm ln}E_T})$, see, for example, ~\\cite{NE}.  However the high $E_T$ jet cross section is too small to identify this effect in the present data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\nWe emphasize that the dynamics of high energy hadron interactions is based on subamplitudes of small transverse size which are distributed over the whole domain occupied by the full interaction amplitude. Thus, in BEC we have to observe a small size object corresponding to the emission of both pions (or both kaons etc.) from a single subamplitude and a larger radius caused by events where the pions are produced from different subamplitudes.  At large $N_{\\rm ch}$ the relative contribution  of the large radius component increase.  Enlarging the $k_t$ of the identical pion pair we improve the space resolution of the BEC analyzer. This allows a better separation of the contributions from the small and large radii components. When $k_t$ becomes too large (say, $k_t\\gapproxeq1$ GeV) the probability to produce such large $k_t$ pions from two different subamplitudes becomes small.  In this case BEC measure the radius of the `jet' which emits this high $k_t$ pair of identical pions. That is, we expect the radius to decrease with increasing $k_t$, reaching {\\it saturation} for $k_t {\\lower .7ex\\hbox{$\\;\\stackrel{\\textstyle                                                     >}{\\sim}\\;$}} 1$ GeV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\nMGR was supported by the RSCF grant 14-22-00281.

On the other hand, the value of $\\alpha'_P$ reflects the internal transverse size of the ladder.  Based on the pre-LHC data, typical numbers are $B_0\\sim 10$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $\\alpha'_P\\sim 0.25$ \\cite{DL}.\n\nStrictly speaking, (\\ref{eq:slope}) corresponds to one-ladder (Reggeon) exchange.  At very high energies the speed of the shrinkage of the diffraction cone increases due to the stronger screening of the amplitude in the centre of the disc, at small impact parameters. Asymptotically, in the black disc limit, where the total cross section grows as ln$^2 s$, the slope $B_{\\rm el}(s)$ also increases as ln$^2s$.  It was shown \\cite{SChMGR}\nthat indeed the high energy LHC data indicate the presence of a ln$^2 s$ component in the elastic slope which is consistent with the growth of the total cross section.\nHowever if we consider an individual ladder then the effective value of $\\alpha'_P$ in the ladder even decreases with energy due to the larger available $k_t$ space for the intermediate partons.  It is known that $\\alpha'_P\\to 0$ in the BFKL case.  Another example is the Monte Carlo description of multiparticle production. In order to tune the generator to the high energy data one has to introduce an infrared cutoff, $k_t^{\\rm min}$ whose value grows as $s^{0.12}$  \\cite{Pythia} -- that is, the transverse size of the ladder decreases.\n\nThus the interaction of two high energy protons should be described by a diagram like Fig.1(c) in which the size of each individual ladder is rather small (as seen from the small value of $\\alpha'_P$). Yet the separation between the ladders is of the order of the radius of the interaction amplitude which should be correlated with the total value of $B_{\\rm el}(s)$.   With increasing energy we expect the transverse size of an individual ladder (measured in the central rapidity interval) will decrease (as indicated by the behaviour of $k_t^{\\rm min}(s)$).  On the other hand the separation between the ladders is expected to increase, as indicated by the behaviour of $B_{\\rm el}(s)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Two components in Bose-Einstein correlations}\nHaving the above picture in mind, we expect in BEC to observe a new object -- a small-size pion source. In other words, BEC should be described by two different radii.\nOne radius corresponds to the case when both pions are emitted from the same ladder -- this will measure the size of an individual `pomeron'. Since the pion is not a point-like object the radius will be smeared out by fluctuations in the process of the formation of the pions.  The second radius will correspond to the pions being emitted from two different ladders -- it is a measure of the separation between the ladders.\nTherefore we propose to fit the observed correlation $R(Q)$ by a formula with two different mean radii\\footnote{Instead of the linear exponents, as in (\\ref{eq:RQ2}), other parametric forms may be considered for each term. For example, the second term may be a Gaussian, $e^{-({\\bar r_2} Q)^2}$. The choice should be based on statistical criteria or on the relative strength of the two terms.   }\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nR(Q)~=~\\lambda~e^{-{\\bar r}_1 Q} + (1-\\lambda)~e^{-{\\bar r_2} Q} ,\n\\label{eq:RQ2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"R(Q)~{}=~{}\\lambda~{}e^{-{\\bar{r}}_{1}Q}+(1-\\lambda)~{}e^{-{\\bar{r}_{2}}Q},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\">=</mo><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>\u03bb</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
