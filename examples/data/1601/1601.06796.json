In this quest, an interesting problem is embodied by the role played by entanglement in processes of work extraction from a working medium embodied by quantum information carriers. In this work, we experimentally address the question \\emph{``Is there any intrinsic advantage for work extraction given by the use of an entangled working medium?\"}. By addressing work-extraction protocols based on a mechanism intimately linked to the paradigm of Maxwell's daemon, and implementing suitably designed multi-photon optical interferometers, we demonstrate experimentally the intrinsic advantages for such tasks provided by bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement. We highlight the unique nature of such tests by comparing their performance to standard tests for the inseparability of multi-photon state resources. Our work contributes strongly to the ongoing efforts in establishing photonic systems as a platform for experiments for information thermodynamics. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nThermodynamics is one of the pillars of physical, chemical and biological sciences~\\cite{zemansky}. It predicts and explains the occurrence and efficiency of complex chemical reactions and biological processes. In physics and engineering, the conduction of heat across a medium, the concept of the arrow of time~\\cite{eddington,campisi}, and the efficiency of motors are formulated in thermodynamic terms~\\cite{sinitsyn}. In information theory, the {\\it mantra} that ``information is physical\" simply entails that, by being encoded in physical supports, information must obey the laws of thermodynamics~\\cite{landauerPT}. Even more, the tightness of the link between information and thermodynamics can be appreciated from the thermodynamic interpretation of the landmark embodied by Landauer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds erasure principle~\\cite{landauer}, Jaynes principle of maximum entropy~\\cite{jaynes}, or the information theoretical exorcism of Maxwell's demon operated by Charlie Bennett~\\cite{bennett}. \n\nMore recently, it has been realized that thermodynamics can be used effectively to provide a new way of assessing and exploiting quantum dynamics, build super-efficient nano- and micro-engines that take advantage of quantum coherence, and assess information theory from the perspective of thermodynamic costs~\\cite{goold}. \n\nIn this context, the identification of the specific features of quantum systems that might influence their thermodynamic performance is still an open and controversial challenge. Quantum coherences are allegedly responsible for the possibility to extract work from a single heat bath~\\cite{scully}. In the weak-driving quantum regime, both discrete and continuous-time heat engine exhibit non-classical signatures enabling enhanced power outputs with respect to the relevant classical (i.e. stochastic) version of such machines~\\cite{uzdin}. \n\nOn the other hand, perfectly reversible work extraction from an ensemble of non-interacting quantum information carriers appears to be possible without the need for creating any entanglement~\\cite{hovhannisyan}. While entangling quantum operations allow for the retrieval of the same amount of work as in the classical case with more economic protocols, such advantage appear to fade away in the case of a large number of systems~\\cite{perarnau}. \n\n\n\n\n\nWithin such an interesting quest for the origin of ``quantumness\" in quantum thermodynamics, a core achievement is given by the design of protocols allowing for an enhanced work extraction from a heat bath when using an entangled working medium rather than a separable one~\\cite{maruyama,viguie}. In turn, such a result embodies a thermodynamics-inspired witness of the presence of (multipartite) entanglement in the working medium, thus contributing explicitly to the formulation of thermodynamic separability criteria. The effectiveness of such approaches to inseparability in the case of physical working media prepared in quantum laboratories has not yet been addressed due to the scarcity of experiments addressing the quantum thermodynamic framework, of which we only have a handful to date~\\cite{experiments}.\n\n\n\nIn this article we bridge this gap by investigating experimentally the quantum enhanced work extraction achieved using non-ideal entangled two- and three-qubit quantum working media. We demonstrate the attainability of an experimental bound on the maximal extractable work that signals the presence of non-classical correlations. Our experiment provides evidence that non-classical correlations empowering work extraction bear differences to those responsible for the violation of Bell-type inequalities. We believe that, through so far unexplored theoretical tools, our results pioneer novel experimental methods towards the understanding of how non-classical correlations can effect the efficiency of quantum thermodynamic processes, at equal footing with thermodynamic potentials. This is a topical problem of both foundational and pragmatic relevance for the development of future engines operating at the nanoscale and in the fully quantum regime.\n\n\nThe remainder of this work is organised as follows: In Sec.~\\ref{2} we illustrate both the theoretical scheme and the experimental implementation for entanglement-enhanced work extraction from a two-qubit photonics working medium. Sec.~\\ref{3} addresses the extension to the first non-trivial multipartite scenario in this context, namely a three-photon resource prepared in either a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, or a $W$ one. Finally, in Sec.~\\ref{final}, while drawing the salient conclusions of our investigation, we present the possible extensions of our study to other information theoretical investigations linked to the relation between (quantum) information and thermodynamics. \n\n\\section{Two-qubit work extraction protocol} \n\\label{2}\n\nWhen introducing his paradigm, Maxwell had in mind Greek daimones ({\\greektext da\\'imones}), i.e. powerful entities bridging the human and the divine. We shall thus formulate our approach in the language of a general game involving two daemons, Aletheia ({\\greektext Al\\'hjeia}) and Bia ({\\greektext B\\'ia}), each attempting at extracting work from a two-qubit system. \n\nThey share an ensemble of identically prepared pairs of qubits, each pair being prepared in a bipartite state $\\rho$. Moreover, they agree on the choice of two sets of measurement operators (one per daemon), that densely cover a great circle on the Bloch sphere of a single qubit. For half of the ensemble, Aletheia should choose from the set $\\{\\hat A_\\theta\\}$ the projection operator to use in order to measure her qubit. In our notation, $\\theta{=}0$ corresponds to the $z$ axes. For the remaining half of the ensemble, Bia shall pick her measurement operator from the set $\\{\\hat B_{\\theta'}\\}$. In these sets, $\\theta$ and $\\theta'$ stand for the angular position, over a great circle of their respective single-qubit Bloch sphere, of the measurements performed by the daemons. In a given run of the game, Aletheia measures operator $\\hat A_\\theta$ and communicates the corresponding outcome $A_\\theta$ to Bia, allowing to reduce the entropy associated to her measurement result from the value $H(B_{\\theta'})$ to the conditional value $H(B_{\\theta'}|A_\\theta)$~\\cite{maruyama}. Having in mind Szilard's version of a Maxwell's daemon-inspired scenario, it is straightforward to see that the amount of work that can be extracted from a system about which we only have partial information is proportional to $1-H(a)$. Here $H(a)$ is the Shannon entropy associated with the binary variable $a$ that embodies the degree of freedom that was measured to gather information on the system. Consequently, the work Bia can extract following Aletheia's measurement and the communication of her result  is $1{-}H(B_{\\theta'}|A_\\theta)$. An analogous reasoning can be carried out when exchanging the role of the daemons, concluding that, for a given setting, we find that the extractable work resulting from one run of the game is \n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\label{lavoro}\nW_\\rho (A_\\theta,B_{\\theta'})&=1-\\frac{1}{2}[H(A_\\theta|B_{\\theta'})+H(B_{\\theta'}|A_\\theta)]\\\\\n&=1-H(A_\\theta,B_{\\theta'})+\\frac12[H(A_\\theta)+H(B_{\\theta'})],\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1X.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle W_{\\rho}(A_{\\theta},B_{\\theta^{\\prime}})\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>\u03c1</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03b8</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><msup><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1X.m3\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=1-\\frac{1}{2}[H(A_{\\theta}|B_{\\theta^{\\prime}})+H(B_{\\theta^{%&#10;\\prime}}|A_{\\theta})]\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>H</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03b8</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><msup><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>H</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><msup><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03b8</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1Xa.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=1-H(A_{\\theta},B_{\\theta^{\\prime}})+\\frac{1}{2}[H(A_{\\theta})+H(%&#10;B_{\\theta^{\\prime}})],\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03b8</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><msup><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03b8</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><msup><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msup></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06796.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle for the great circles being considered.

This is the set of directions allowing for optimal work extraction. The observed oscillations are due to the polarization unbalance, while the average level is affected by the purity of the state. For each choice of $\\theta$, we have calculated the Shannon entropy associated to  single-particle operators, as well as the joint entropy associated to the joint operator. We have verified by numerical simulations that our covering with 19 different directions is sufficiently dense for the continuous approximation to hold. In addition, we have fully characterised our states with quantum state tomography, from which the maximal value of the Bell operator $S$ has been extracted for a comparison with a standard entanglement witness. \n\nIn order to perform the average over the projections performed by the daemons, we removed the quarter waveplates (QWPs) from the polarization analysis-module shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:exp_setup}, and used the half waveplates (HWPs) to rotate the state along the correct big circle. The effect of the polarization beam splitter (PBS) is that of performing the projection $\\vert H \\rangle \\langle H \\vert$. As we used just two avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) after the PBSs, we had to implement four different types of measurements for each of the 19 choices of angular direction on the equator of the single-qubit Bloch sphere. In particular, we had to consider the four sets of directions $(\\theta_A,{\\theta'}_B)=(\\theta,\\theta), (\\theta,\\theta+45\\si{\\degree}), (\\theta+45\\si{\\degree},\\theta), (\\theta+45\\si{\\degree},\\theta+45\\si{\\degree})$, where the first (second) angular direction is for Aletheia's (Bia's) measurements choice. The corresponding detected coincidences at the APDs are labelled as $N_{\\theta_A,{\\theta'}_B}$. A full circulation of the Bloch-sphere equator is then achieved by rotating the HWPs from $0\\si{\\degree}$ to $45\\si{\\degree}$ in 19 steps. This implies that a total of 76 measurements were needed in order to acquire the  necessary information to perform the evaluation of the work extraction performance.

This is the set of directions allowing for optimal work extraction. The observed oscillations are due to the polarization unbalance, while the average level is affected by the purity of the state. For each choice of $\\theta$, we have calculated the Shannon entropy associated to  single-particle operators, as well as the joint entropy associated to the joint operator. We have verified by numerical simulations that our covering with 19 different directions is sufficiently dense for the continuous approximation to hold. In addition, we have fully characterised our states with quantum state tomography, from which the maximal value of the Bell operator $S$ has been extracted for a comparison with a standard entanglement witness. \n\nIn order to perform the average over the projections performed by the daemons, we removed the quarter waveplates (QWPs) from the polarization analysis-module shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:exp_setup}, and used the half waveplates (HWPs) to rotate the state along the correct big circle. The effect of the polarization beam splitter (PBS) is that of performing the projection $\\vert H \\rangle \\langle H \\vert$. As we used just two avalanche photo-diodes (APDs) after the PBSs, we had to implement four different types of measurements for each of the 19 choices of angular direction on the equator of the single-qubit Bloch sphere. In particular, we had to consider the four sets of directions $(\\theta_A,{\\theta'}_B)=(\\theta,\\theta), (\\theta,\\theta+45\\si{\\degree}), (\\theta+45\\si{\\degree},\\theta), (\\theta+45\\si{\\degree},\\theta+45\\si{\\degree})$, where the first (second) angular direction is for Aletheia's (Bia's) measurements choice. The corresponding detected coincidences at the APDs are labelled as $N_{\\theta_A,{\\theta'}_B}$. A full circulation of the Bloch-sphere equator is then achieved by rotating the HWPs from $0\\si{\\degree}$ to $45\\si{\\degree}$ in 19 steps. This implies that a total of 76 measurements were needed in order to acquire the  necessary information to perform the evaluation of the work extraction performance.

In this scenario, both the figure of merit presented in Eq.~\\eqref{lavoro} and the threshold for inseparability based on extractable work need to be adjusted to capture the above mentioned richness. In particular, it is well known that, for pure states, only two non-equivalent classes of genuine multipartite entanglement exist~\\cite{dur}, either the GHZ or $W$ class, the situation being more complex when mixed states are considered. In our investigation, we focus on the ability of distinguishing GHZ-type entanglement from W-type one using thermodynamics bound, as opposed to state fidelity~\\cite{weinfurter}. The extractable work-based inseparability criterion should thus incorporate the possibility for the resource that we address to belong to either class.\n\nThe protocol now involves a further daemon, Charis ({\\greektext Q\\'aris}), which is set to extract work from her subsystem, based on information provided by both Aletheia and Bia. The strategy they agreed on consists of the following steps: \n\\begin{enumerate}[{\\bf a}]\n\\item Aletheia and Bia perform a projective measurement along a common axis $u$ in the single-qubit Bloch sphere chosen among the three Pauli settings.\n\\item Charis receives information on the outcomes of such measurements.

We have considered an experimental state with large bias ($\\cos\\varphi=0.25\\pm0.03$) and purity ($\\mu=0.97$) that offers no violation of the local realistic bound ($S=1.977\\pm0.009$). However, the corresponding extractable work is ${\\cal W}=0.491\\pm0.021$, which exceeds the separability threshold ${\\cal W}_{f}$ by 2 standard deviations. This implies that the use of entanglement for powering a thermal machine is qualitatively different from that necessary for communication tasks, such as measurement-independent key distribution. Fig.~\\ref{fig:3D_graphs} shows a comprehensive comparison between the theoretical predictions gathered by using Eq.~\\eqref{state} and the experimental data, revealing the great agreement between the latter and the former throughout the whole range of parameters assessed in our experimental investigation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}[b!]\n    \\label{tab:table1}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc} \n\n\\hline\n\\hline\n$\\mu$ & $\\varphi$ & ${\\cal W}$ & $S$ & $T$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n\n0.51 & 0.91(4) & 0.193(5) & 1.404(7) & 0.04(1) \\\\\n0.77 & 0.91(4) & 0.441(6) & {\\bf 2.073(7)} & 0.34(4) \\\\\n0.82 & 0.91(4) & {\\bf 0.534(6)} & {\\bf 2.237(8)} & 0.48(5) \\\\\n0.87 & 0.91(4) & {\\bf 0.652(6)} & {\\bf 2.400(8)} & 0.60(5) \\\\\n0.92 & 0.91(4) & {\\bf 0.749(6)} & {\\bf 2.602(8)} & 0.81(6) \\\\\n0.98 & 0.91(4) & {\\bf 0.805(6)} & {\\bf 2.690(8)} & 0.91(4) \\\\\n\\hline\n0.51 & 0.54(7) & 0.160(7) & 1.325(7) & 0.03(1) \\\\\n0.61 & 0.54(7) & 0.238(8) & 1.587(7) & 0.13(2) \\\\\n0.69 & 0.54(7) & 0.302(8) & 1.786(8) & 0.20(2) \\\\\n0.74 & 0.54(7) & 0.376(8) & 1.997(8) & 0.34(3) \\\\\n0.82 & 0.54(7) & {\\bf 0.524(9)} & {\\bf 2.157(8)} & 0.45(2) \\\\\n0.87 & 0.54(7) & {\\bf 0.615(9)} & {\\bf 2.343(8)} & 0.62(3) \\\\\n0.92 & 0.54(7) & {\\bf 0.669(9)} & {\\bf 2.499(8)} & 0.78(3) \\\\\n0.98 & 0.54(7) & {\\bf 0.726(9)} & {\\bf 2.541(8)} & 0.82(3) \\\\\n\\hline\n0.93 & 1.25(4) & {\\bf 0.501(12)} & {\\bf 2.131(9)} & 0.34(4) \\\\\n\\hline\n0.95 & 1.32(4) & {\\bf 0.491(21)} & 1.977(9) & 0.24(4) \\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\label{tab:exp_data}\n\\caption{Table of the experimental data.

Each panel illustrates one of the steps of the protocol described in the main text. }\n\\label{fig:schemaTripartito}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe now extend our investigation to the case of a tripartite system, which naturally present a richer entanglement-sharing structure, and embody the first non trivial instance of systems exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement~\\cite{horodecki}. In this scenario, both the figure of merit presented in Eq.~\\eqref{lavoro} and the threshold for inseparability based on extractable work need to be adjusted to capture the above mentioned richness. In particular, it is well known that, for pure states, only two non-equivalent classes of genuine multipartite entanglement exist~\\cite{dur}, either the GHZ or $W$ class, the situation being more complex when mixed states are considered. In our investigation, we focus on the ability of distinguishing GHZ-type entanglement from W-type one using thermodynamics bound, as opposed to state fidelity~\\cite{weinfurter}. The extractable work-based inseparability criterion should thus incorporate the possibility for the resource that we address to belong to either class.\n\nThe protocol now involves a further daemon, Charis ({\\greektext Q\\'aris}), which is set to extract work from her subsystem, based on information provided by both Aletheia and Bia. The strategy they agreed on consists of the following steps: \n\\begin{enumerate}[{\\bf a}]\n\\item Aletheia and Bia perform a projective measurement along a common axis $u$ in the single-qubit Bloch sphere chosen among the three Pauli settings.\n\\item Charis receives information on the outcomes of such measurements. In light of such information, she can extract work from her system by performing a projective measurement along the suitably chosen direction $v$ on the Bloch sphere. The amount of work that can be obtained in a single run of such a tripartite game is then\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nW_{\\rho}(A_u,B_u,C_v)=1-H(C_v|A_u,B_u),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"W_{\\rho}(A_{u},B_{u},C_{v})=1-H(C_{v}|A_{u},B_{u}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>\u03c1</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>u</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mi>u</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>v</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>H</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>v</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>u</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mi>u</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06796.tex", "nexttext": "\nA violation of this bound signals the presence of entanglement in the state. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n{\\bf (a)}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{GHZCLUSGraph.pdf}\\\\\n{\\bf (b)}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{WGraph.pdf}\n\\caption{Density plot of the theoretical work that can be extracted from pure-state tripartite resources against the angles $(\\theta,\\phi)$ that identify the angular direction of the Bloch sphere in which ${\\cal W}(\\rho)$ can be optimized.

Such states are generated by adding a path-encoded qubit to the two-qubit setup shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:exp_setup}. This qubit is experimentally obtained by introducing a Sagnac interferometer (consisting of a 50:50 BS and three mirrors) over the path of one of the two photons. Encoding in the path degree of freedom is then obtained by considering the logical state ${\\vert{0}\\rangle}$ (clockwise circulation of a photon inside the interferometer) and ${\\vert{1}\\rangle}$ (anticlockwise circulation). The phase $\\phi$ between such logical state can be tuned by tilting a thin glass plate, placed in one of the paths. This arrangement allowed us to engineer a GHZ-Cluster state of the form $(|HH0\\rangle-|VV0\\rangle+|HV1\\rangle+|VH1\\rangle)_{ABC}/2$ by introducing a HWP at 0${\\si{\\degree}}$ on the clockwise path ${\\vert{0}\\rangle}$ and a HWP at 45${\\si{\\degree}}$ on the anticlockwise one [cf.

Such protocols, in turn, represent  viable tests for the inseparability of a given state resource that, as demonstrated in our experimental endeavors, are both practical and fundamentally interesting in light of their distinct nature from, say, non-locality based entanglement witnesses. This work has significant implications for both technological and conceptual aspects. Concerning the technological advances that it entails, we contribute to the well sought-after and ongoing efforts aimed at setting up a photonics-based platform for information thermodynamics. Such platform has the capability of preparing, controlling and measuring, with high fidelity and a reduced experimental complexity, states of a multipartite working medium. Furthermore, general evolutions can be easily implemented or simulated, thus paving the way to the implementation of a fully fledged experimental assessment of non-equilibrium dynamics. The latter has so far been limited to either classical systems or nuclear magnetic resonance setups, where any quantum feature is weakened by the typically strong environmental actions. As for the fundamental aspects, we have highlighted how non-classical correlations within the working medium should be interpreted as a resource for the performance of thermodynamic processes, not differently from quantities with a counterpart in classical thermodynamics. This points to an interesting direction for understanding the emergence of ordinary world from its quantum microscopic constituents.\n\n \n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to M.

The results of our analysis are presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:simulTripartito}, where the extra work-extraction possibilities offered by the use of a GHZ-Cluster are clearly showcased. \nThe study can be extended to the case of mixed-state resources by addressing the effects that a non-unit value of $\\mu$ has on the performance of the work extraction protocol. This is done in Fig.~\\ref{fig:simulWernerTripartito}, where we have investigated the behavior of work against $\\mu$ for the following sets of angles $(\\theta,\\phi)=(90^{\\si{\\degree}},0^{\\si{\\degree}}),~(0^{\\si{\\degree}},0^{\\si{\\degree}})$ and $(0^{\\si{\\degree}},90^{\\si{\\degree}})$, displaying the different performance of work extraction against different choices of great circle orientation.\n\n\n\nWe have tested these predictions in a two-photon implementation of both a three-qubit GHZ-Cluster type state and a $W$ type one. Such states are generated by adding a path-encoded qubit to the two-qubit setup shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:exp_setup}. This qubit is experimentally obtained by introducing a Sagnac interferometer (consisting of a 50:50 BS and three mirrors) over the path of one of the two photons. Encoding in the path degree of freedom is then obtained by considering the logical state ${\\vert{0}\\rangle}$ (clockwise circulation of a photon inside the interferometer) and ${\\vert{1}\\rangle}$ (anticlockwise circulation). The phase $\\phi$ between such logical state can be tuned by tilting a thin glass plate, placed in one of the paths. This arrangement allowed us to engineer a GHZ-Cluster state of the form $(|HH0\\rangle-|VV0\\rangle+|HV1\\rangle+|VH1\\rangle)_{ABC}/2$ by introducing a HWP at 0${\\si{\\degree}}$ on the clockwise path ${\\vert{0}\\rangle}$ and a HWP at 45${\\si{\\degree}}$ on the anticlockwise one [cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:set-upGHZ} {\\bf (a)}]. On the other hand, a $W$-type resource state of the form ${\\vert{W}\\rangle}=(|HH1\\rangle+|HV0\\rangle+|VH0\\rangle)/\\sqrt{3}$ can be easily engineered by modifying the configuration for the GHZ-Cluster state.

This allows them to build the the statistical correlation function for local spin measurements $E(\\alpha_A,\\alpha_B,\\alpha_C)$ and, in turn, construct the Mermin-Ardehali-Belisnskii-Klyshko function~\\cite{mermin}\n\n", "index": 25, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_3&=E(\\alpha_A,\\alpha_B,\\alpha'_C)+E(\\alpha_A,\\alpha'_B,\\alpha_C)\\\\\n&+E(\\alpha'_A,\\alpha_B,\\alpha_C)-E(\\alpha'_A,\\alpha'_B,\\alpha'_C).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15X.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle M_{3}\" display=\"inline\"><msub><mi>M</mi><mn>3</mn></msub></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15X.m3\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=E(\\alpha_{A},\\alpha_{B},\\alpha^{\\prime}_{C})+E(\\alpha_{A},\\alpha%&#10;^{\\prime}_{B},\\alpha_{C})\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>C</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15Xa.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle+E(\\alpha^{\\prime}_{A},\\alpha_{B},\\alpha_{C})-E(\\alpha^{\\prime}_{%&#10;A},\\alpha^{\\prime}_{B},\\alpha^{\\prime}_{C}).\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>C</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo>,</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
