Dynamical and transport\nphenomena in this kind of structures are also radically different compared\nto periodic media \\cite{phonon,phonon 2,transport}. The interested\nreader can refer to some of the available monographies \n(e.g. \\cite{optics general,transport general}) for more details. \n\nQuasiperiodic arrangements can be realized in a large variety of structures\nwith different properties, but a systematic classification of these orders \nand their related properties is still lacking. \nIn one dimension (1D)\nthe paradigm of a quasicrystal is the \nFibonacci lattice (FL).\nThis is a 1D lattice\nwhose relative distances between two adjacent points belong to the set $\\{L,S\\}$, standing for Long and Short respectively, \nand are arranged according to a specific\nsequence (see below). The two lengths $L$ and $S$ are often chosen such that\n$L/S=\\tau$, where $\\tau=\\left(\\sqrt{5}+1\\right)/2$ is the \\emph{golden ratio}. \nNevertheless it is possible to construct Fibonacci lattices\nwith $L/S\\neq\\tau$.\nIn view of their technological applications \nbut also purely from the fundamental point of view,\nit is interesting to investigate whether there exists \nany relation between different FLs, \nand how a given geometry determines their physical properties.\n\nOne issue worth being addressed is\nwhether different FLs having arbitrary length ratios,\ncharacterized by the \nquantity $\\eta=S/\\left(L-S\\right)$, \nproduce diffraction spectra related to each other, similarly\nto what happens in periodic lattices for which a change in the lattice\nparameter simply results in an expansion or a contraction\nof the spectrum along the wavevector axis. We show\nthat this is not the case: two FLs having different $\\eta$'s produce\nin general completely different diffraction spectra \nwhich are not trivially related by simple rescaling, \neven if the Fibonacci sequence of the $L$ and $S$ segments from which they come, is the same. \n\nIn this paper we show that it \nis possible to group the Fibonacci lattices into \\emph{equivalence classes} \nfor which the diffraction spectrum is \\emph{essentially}\nthe same up to a proper rescaling. This means that, even if the spectrum\nis not exactly the same, the most prominent features are shared by\nall FLs belonging to the same class. For each\nclass it is possible to define a representative lattice whose\ndiffraction spectrum contains (up to a proper rescaling) the basic ``shape''\nof all the spectra belonging to the same class. Our theoretical analysis\nis compared with a real case, by performing optical diffraction\nmeasurements on several 1D Fibonacci gratings.\n   \n\\section{Fibonacci lattices and their diffraction pattern}\nA Fibonacci string is any word made of two letters, $L$ and $S$, \nobtained by means of the substitution rule $LS\\rightarrow L$\nand $L\\rightarrow S$ starting from the letter $S$. When this procedure\nis iterated, we get an infinite string whose initial elements are\n$LSLLSLSLLSLLSLSLLSLSL\\cdots$. By associating to $L$ and $S$\nsegments of different lengths $L>S$\non the real line, we obtain a succession of real numbers which hereafter\nwill be referred to as Fibonacci lattice (FL). Without\nloss of generality, we will always assume that lengths are rescaled\nsuch that the length of the segment $S$ is normalized to $1$. \nTherefore it is possible to describe {\\it any} FL in terms of the sole \nparameter $\\eta=S/(L-S)>0$. \nIt is easy to verify \\cite{levine1986} that the positions \non the real line of the end points of these segments \narranged according to a Fibonacci string are given by:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:fibscaled}\nx_{n}^{\\eta}=n-1+\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{\\tau}\\right\\rfloor\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"x_{n}^{\\eta}=n-1+\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{\\tau}\\right\\rfloor\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>\u03b7</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>\u03b7</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\u230a</mo><mfrac><mi>n</mi><mi>\u03c4</mi></mfrac><mo>\u230b</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07499.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nFor a $1D$ periodic lattice ($x_{n}=na$), the maxima of the diffraction pattern\noccur at points in reciprocal space satisfying Laue conditions,\n$Q(h)=h 2\\pi/a$, ($h\\in\\mathbb{Z}$) which shows that in this case\nthe reciprocal lattice is also periodic.

By applying the composition\nrule several times, the diffraction pattern develops more and more details\nand ultimately tends to the diffraction pattern of the canonical FL with\n$\\eta=\\tau$.\n\n\\section{Diffraction from Fibonacci gratings and their similarity}\nTo test experimentally the diffraction from FL's, a series of quasi\n- periodic diffraction gratings have been prepared using a photorefractive\ndirect laser writing (DLW) technique \\cite{Scrittura}. This technique\nconsists in scanning with a focused laser beam a photorefractive sample,\nengraving on it a series of lines with a modified refractive index\nwith respect to the rest of the sample. The scanning movement is performed\nby translating the sample with the aid of a computer - controlled\nXY stage at constant speed of 50 $\\mu m/s$. The nominal precision\nof the translation stage is 0.5$\\mu m$ for the conditions used in\nthis experiment. A frequency doubled diode pumped $\\textrm{Nd:YWO}_{4}$\nsolid state laser (Coherent Verdi V5) emitting a CW beam at 532 nm\nhas been used as light source for DLW. The beam was suitably attenuated\nby a series of neutral density filters and sent to a focusing microscope\nobjective (Olympus 100X/0.80) so that the power after the objective\nwas set at 17 mW. The substrate used to engrave the optical structures\nis a slab of photorefractive lithium niobate doped with iron at the\nnominal concentration of 0.1 mol\\% in the melt. The sample was X-cut\nwith dimensions ($\\textrm{X}\\times\\textrm{Y}\\times\\textrm{Z}$) $1\\textrm{mm}\\times8\\textrm{mm}\\times13\\textrm{mm}$\nand the lines were written on the X face, by scanning along the Y\ndirection with an ordinarily polarized beam. This process can induce\nextraordinary refractive index changes as large as $10^{-3}$in the\nwritten lines and therefore can be used to produce arbitrary diffraction\nstructures. \nThe diffraction pattern of these structures was measured with the\nhelp of a computer - controlled optical diffractometer in which the\nsample and the detector were mounted on two co - axial goniometers\nthat were independently controlled by a computer \\cite{Argiolas 2007}.\nAn optical beam produced by a He-Ne laser at 632.8 nm with a power\nof 4 mW was expanded, polarized along the extraordinary direction\nand finally transmitted through the sample surface, resulting in a\nclearly visible diffraction pattern. This pattern was measured by\na Si photodiode and a lock - in amplifier and recorded on the computer\nas a function of the detector and of the sample angle.\nIn order to compare the experimental data with the theoretical calculation\nwe need to take into account that our gratings are made up of a (quasi)\nperiodic repetition of a region with a modified refractive index,\n$\\Delta n(x)$. This leads to the fact, well known from standard diffraction\ntheory, that the diffracted intensity in reciprocal space is proportional\nto the product of two terms: a first one, $S(q)$=$\\left|\\int\\Delta n(x)e^{\\imath xq}dx\\right|^{2}$\nwhich depends on the detailed structure of the repeated unit of the\ngrating (\\emph{structure factor}) and a second term due to lattice\ngeometry, which is the true object of this study (see Eq.

(\\ref{eq:fibrinorm}) and therefore\nonly if they belong to the same equivalence class.\n\nThe diffraction patterns of\nFL's belonging to the same equivalence class share the main features   \nas a consequence of the way composition rule operates.\nThis is a consequence of the self-similarity of Fibonacci\nstrings under composition.\nThe generator of a class is, in this sense, the simplest structure\ngiving a diffraction pattern which contains the main features common\nto all of the other elements of the class. By applying the composition\nrule several times, the diffraction pattern develops more and more details\nand ultimately tends to the diffraction pattern of the canonical FL with\n$\\eta=\\tau$.\n\n\\section{Diffraction from Fibonacci gratings and their similarity}\nTo test experimentally the diffraction from FL's, a series of quasi\n- periodic diffraction gratings have been prepared using a photorefractive\ndirect laser writing (DLW) technique \\cite{Scrittura}. This technique\nconsists in scanning with a focused laser beam a photorefractive sample,\nengraving on it a series of lines with a modified refractive index\nwith respect to the rest of the sample. The scanning movement is performed\nby translating the sample with the aid of a computer - controlled\nXY stage at constant speed of 50 $\\mu m/s$. The nominal precision\nof the translation stage is 0.5$\\mu m$ for the conditions used in\nthis experiment. A frequency doubled diode pumped $\\textrm{Nd:YWO}_{4}$\nsolid state laser (Coherent Verdi V5) emitting a CW beam at 532 nm\nhas been used as light source for DLW. The beam was suitably attenuated\nby a series of neutral density filters and sent to a focusing microscope\nobjective (Olympus 100X/0.80) so that the power after the objective\nwas set at 17 mW. The substrate used to engrave the optical structures\nis a slab of photorefractive lithium niobate doped with iron at the\nnominal concentration of 0.1 mol\\% in the melt. The sample was X-cut\nwith dimensions ($\\textrm{X}\\times\\textrm{Y}\\times\\textrm{Z}$) $1\\textrm{mm}\\times8\\textrm{mm}\\times13\\textrm{mm}$\nand the lines were written on the X face, by scanning along the Y\ndirection with an ordinarily polarized beam. This process can induce\nextraordinary refractive index changes as large as $10^{-3}$in the\nwritten lines and therefore can be used to produce arbitrary diffraction\nstructures. \nThe diffraction pattern of these structures was measured with the\nhelp of a computer - controlled optical diffractometer in which the\nsample and the detector were mounted on two co - axial goniometers\nthat were independently controlled by a computer \\cite{Argiolas 2007}.\nAn optical beam produced by a He-Ne laser at 632.8 nm with a power\nof 4 mW was expanded, polarized along the extraordinary direction\nand finally transmitted through the sample surface, resulting in a\nclearly visible diffraction pattern. This pattern was measured by\na Si photodiode and a lock - in amplifier and recorded on the computer\nas a function of the detector and of the sample angle.\nIn order to compare the experimental data with the theoretical calculation\nwe need to take into account that our gratings are made up of a (quasi)\nperiodic repetition of a region with a modified refractive index,\n$\\Delta n(x)$. This leads to the fact, well known from standard diffraction\ntheory, that the diffracted intensity in reciprocal space is proportional\nto the product of two terms: a first one, $S(q)$=$\\left|\\int\\Delta n(x)e^{\\imath xq}dx\\right|^{2}$\nwhich depends on the detailed structure of the repeated unit of the\ngrating (\\emph{structure factor}) and a second term due to lattice\ngeometry, which is the true object of this study (see Eq.

A similar figure \nis obtained for\nthe case $\\eta^{a}_1=17/6$. It can be seen that the agreement is very\nsatisfactory: not only the position but also the intensity of the\ndiffraction peaks is correctly obtained, confirming that our approach\nis reliable. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Iq_theo_exp_n-300_eta0-15-8}\n\\protect\\protect\\caption{(Color online).

From this observation we conclude that\nthe correct way to relate FL's to their diffraction spectra is by\nmean of equivalence classes, i.e. subsets of all possible lattices\nlinked together by the compostion rule. Experimental observations\nmatch well with these previsions.\n\nSince diffraction is a prototype phenomenon in which the phase relationship\nbetween the differently scattered waves play a crucial role, we believe\nthat our observations may be useful also for the description of analogous\nphenomena related to the exchange of momentum between an aperiodic\nFibonacci lattice and a wavefield.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nNL and LD acknowledge financial support from MIUR, through FIRB Project \nNo. RBFR12NLNA\\_002.\nLV and MB acknowledge financial support from \\emph{Chip \\& CIOP} project\nof the University of Padova CPDA120359.
