By utilising an ALMA pilot study on a subset of our {bright} SCUBA-2 sample as a training set, along with the deep optical-near-infrared data available in this field, we develop a novel technique, Optical-IR Triple Color (OIRTC), using $z-K$, $K-[3.6]$, $[3.6]-[4.5]$ colors to select the candidate submillimeter galaxy (SMG) counterparts. By combining radio identification and the OIRTC technique, we find counterpart candidates for 80\\% of the {\\it Class} = 1 $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ SCUBA-2 sample, defined as those that are covered by both radio and OIR imaging and the base sample for our scientific analyses. Based on the ALMA training set, we expect the accuracy of these identifications to be $82\\pm20$\\%, with a completeness of $69\\pm16$\\%, {essentially as accurate as the traditional $p$-value technique but with higher completeness}. We find that the fraction of SCUBA-2 sources having candidate counterparts is lower for fainter 850\\,$\\mu$m sources, and we argue that for follow-up observations sensitive to SMGs with $S_{850}\\gtrsim 1$\\,mJy across the whole ALMA beam, the fraction with multiple counterparts is likely to be $>40$\\% for SCUBA-2 sources at $S_{850} \\gtrsim 4$\\,mJy. We find that the photometric redshift distribution for the SMGs is well fit by a lognormal distribution, with a median redshift of $z=2.3\\pm0.1$. After accounting for the sources without any {radio and/or OIRTC} counterpart, we estimate the median redshift to be $z=2.6\\pm0.1$ for SMGs with $S_{850} >1$\\,mJy. We also use this new large sample to study the clustering of SMGs and the the far-infrared properties of the unidentified submillimeter sources by stacking their {\\it Herschel} SPIRE far-infrared emission.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{cosmology: observations --- galaxies: evolution --- galaxies: formation}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nUltra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, with infrared luminosities of $L_{\\rm IR}\\geq $\\,10$^{12}$\\,L$_{\\odot}$; \\citealt{Sanders:1996p6419}) are relatively rare at $z\\sim$\\,0, but their space density rapidly increases with look-back time and apparently peaks around $z\\sim$\\,2--3 (e.g., \\citealt{Barger:1999p6801, Chapman:2005p5778, Le-Floch:2005fk, Gruppioni:2013aa}). The vast majority of the luminosity of these sources escapes in the far-infrared (far-IR) and submillimeter and as a result they are the brightest extragalactic sources in the far-IR/submillimeter sky. The shape of the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks around $\\sim$\\,100\\,$\\mu$m and declines at longer wavelengths (e.g., \\citealt{U:2012aa, Symeonidis:2013aa, Swinbank:2014ul}). This characteristic form yields a ``negative $K$-correction'' for observations in the submillimeter waveband \\citep{Blain:1993aa}, with the apparent flux of a source with a fixed infrared luminosity remaining almost constant over a wide range in redshift, $z\\sim$\\,1--6 (e.g., \\citealt{Blain:2002p8120, Casey:2014aa}). When combined with the typical sensitivities and confusion limits of existing far-IR/submillimeter observatories (e.g., {\\it Herschel}, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope [JCMT] or the Large Millimetre Telescope [LMT]), the negative $K$-correction means that surveys for high-redshift ULIRGs are most efficiently undertaken in wavebands around $\\sim$\\,1\\,mm, leading to the association of name ``submillimeter galaxies'' (SMGs) with this population (e.g., \\citealt{Smail:1997p6820}). Moreover, the surface density of high-redshift ULIRGs is also best-matched to the wide-field capabilities of single-dish telescopes, rather than the narrow field of view of current (sub)millimeter interferometers.  This has been the motivation for a series of panoramic (sub)millimeter surveys over the past decade using first-generation bolometer cameras on the JCMT, the IRAM 30-m, APEX and ASTE (e.g., \\citealt{Barger:1998p13566, Hughes:1998p9666, Scott:2002p6539, Coppin:2006p9123, Bertoldi:2007aa, Weis:2009qy, Scott:2010pp, Ikarashi:2011aa}). By exploiting the technical advances in the fabrication of bolometer cameras, specifically the SCUBA-2 camera on JCMT, recent submillimeter surveys have been mapping the sky in an unprecedented speed \\citep{Chen:2013fk, Chen:2013gq, Geach:2013kx, Casey:2013aa}. Most recently an international team completed the SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS), undertaking panoramic surveys on square degree areas down to mJy sensitivity limits (see Geach et al.\\ in prep for a description of the survey).   \n\nTo use these (sub)millimeter surveys to understand the cause of the rapid evolution of the ULIRG population and its relation to the galaxy populations seen both today and at earlier times, it is essential to reliably locate the counterparts to the (sub)millimeter sources at other wavelengths, necessary to understand the physical properties and astrophysics of these systems. However, the combination of the high dust obscuration in these systems, their high redshifts, and the coarse resolution of the (sub)millimeter maps (${\\mathrel{\\raise0.35ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle >$}\\kern-0.6em \t\t\\lower0.40ex\\hbox{{$\\scriptstyle \\sim$}}}} $\\,10--30$''$ FWHM) provided by single-dish observatories make this process challenging. Much of the early work on the properties of high-redshift ULIRGs relied on identifications based on indirect tracers of the far-IR/submillimeter emission such as the radio, near-IR, and mid-IR (e.g., \\citealt{Ivison:1998p10286, Ivison:2002uq, Smail:2000p6377};  although see \\citealt{Downes:1999aa, Dannerbauer:2002aa}). These techniques have been used to derive identifications for samples of $\\sim$\\,100 SMGs from a number of surveys (e.g., \\citealt{Pope:2006p8076, Lindner:2011aa, Biggs:2011uq, Yun:2012aa, Michaowski:2012aa, Alberts:2013aa}), but are known to be biased against identifying the highest-redshift ULIRGs due to the absence of a negative $K$-correction in the radio or IR (e.g., \\citealt{Chapman:2005p5778}). \n\nLuckily, in parallel with the developments of new large-format (sub)millimeter bolometer cameras, the commissioning of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and upgrades to the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Northern Extended Millimetre Array (NOEMA) have produced a similar advance in the capabilities of (sub)millimeter interferometers for studying submillimeter sources (e.g., \\citealt{Gear:2000aa, Dannerbauer:2002aa, Dannerbauer:2008aa, Iono:2006p6985, Tacconi:2006p8449, Wang:2007p6971, Wang:2011p9293, Younger:2007p6982, Younger:2008p8372, Younger:2009p9502, Cowie:2009p6978, Aravena:2010p8370, Tamura:2010aa, Knudsen:2010lr, Chen:2011p11605, Chen:2014aa, Barger:2012lr, Barger:2014aa, Smolcic:2012pp, Hodge:2013lr, Simpson:2015aa, Simpson:2015ab, Ikarashi:2014aa, Miettinen:2015aa}).  \n\nThe first results from ALMA on the identifications of SMG counterparts to submillimeter sources by \\citet{Hodge:2013lr} confirmed some of the biases and incompleteness arising from the use of radio and mid-IR, with $\\sim$80\\% of SMGs correctly identified but with a completeness of just 45\\%. While such interferometric studies highlight the usefulness of obtaining identifications in the submillimeter for SMGs, the limited time available on these facilities means it is currently {time-expensive} to use them to map the very large samples of (sub)millimeter sources from the latest bolometer surveys. For this reason we are driven back to using the indirect tracers. However, techniques that are used to select the counterpart candidates can be investigated, trained, and improved by using the results of these interferometric observations.\n\nHere we present counterparts to the $\\sim$\\,1,000 submillimeter sources that have been detected in the S2CLS 850\\,$\\mu$m map of the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey field (UDS). This is one of the widest and most sensitive blank-field 850\\,$\\mu$m surveys yet completed, with a median 1\\,$\\sigma$ noise of 1\\,$\\sigma = 0.9$\\,mJy across $\\sim$1 degree$^2$ (Geach et al.\\ in preparation). The UKIDSS-UDS field is an exceptionally well-studied region of the extragalactic sky with sensitive multi-wavelength coverage of the $\\sim$1 degree$^2$ region from the ultraviolet to mid-infrared and radio (see \\autoref{sec:obs} for references). Our analysis also takes advantage of deep ALMA Cycle 1 observations of a subset of the submillimeter sources in this region \\citep{Simpson:2015ab, Simpson:2015aa}, which provide an invaluable resource for training and developing new techniques to select the SMG counterparts to the submillimeter sources detected in the low-resolution single-dish observations.\n\nThe structure of the paper is: in \\S2 we describe the submillimeter survey of the UKIDSS-UDS field, along with the ancillary data from X-ray to radio that are used in this study.  \\S3 then describes the process, including the novel OIRTC technique, developed for the identifications, which exploits the ALMA identifications of SMGs associated with a sample of the brighter submillimeter sources in the field. In \\S4 we present the catalog of counterpart candidates and discuss their properties, while \\S5 gives our summary. \nThroughout this paper we adopt the AB magnitude system \\citep{Oke:1983aa}, and we assume the {\\it Planck} cosmology: H$_0 =$\\,67.77\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\\Omega_M = $\\,0.31, and $\\Omega_\\Lambda =$\\,0.69 \\citep{Planck-Collaboration:2014aa}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=1]{fig1.pdf}\n       \\caption{An overview of S2CLS-UDS. {\\it Left:} The matched-filtered S2CLS SCUBA-2 850\\,$\\mu$m flux density map of the UKIDSS UDS field, linearly scaled between -1 to 5\\,mJy.

The full data reduction steps are described fully in Geach et al.\\ (2015 in preparation), but we describe the main steps here.  The Dynamical Iterative Map-Maker ({\\sc dimm}) within the {\\it Sub-Millimetre Common User Reduction Facility} ({\\sc smurf}; \\citealt{Chapin:2013fk}) is used to extract astronomical signal from each SCUBA-2 bolometer time stream, mapping the result onto a celestial projection. All S2CLS maps are projected on a tangential co-ordinate system with 2$''$ pixels.\n\nFlat-fields are applied to the time-streams using flat scans that bracket each observation, and a polynomial baseline fit is subtracted from each time stream. Data spikes are rejected (using a 5\\,$\\sigma$ threshold in a box size of 50 samples), DC steps are removed and gaps filled. Next, an iterative process begins that aims to fit the data with a model comprising a common mode signal, astronomical signal and noise. The common mode modelling is performed independently for each SCUBA-2 sub-array, deriving a template for the average signal seen by all the bolometers; it is removed from the stream, and an extinction correction is applied \\citep{Dempsey:2013qy}. Next, a filtering step is performed in the Fourier domain, which rejects data at frequencies\ncorresponding to angular scales $\\theta>150''$ and $\\theta< 4''$. Finally, a model of the  astronomical signal is determined by gridding the time streams onto a celestial projection (since a given sky position will have been visited by many independent bolometers) and then subtracted from the input time streams. The iterative process continues until the residual between the model and the data converges.\n\nThe last processing step is to apply a matched filter to the maps, convolving with the instrumental PSF to optimize the detection of point sources. We use the {\\sc picard} recipe {\\it scuba2\\_matched\\_filter} which first smooths the map (and the PSF) with a 30$''$ gaussian kernel, then subtracts this from both to remove any large scale structure not eliminated in the filtering steps that occurred during the {\\sc dimm} reduction. The map is then convolved with the smoothed beam. A flux conversion factor of 591\\,Jy\\,beam$^{-1}$\\,pW$^{-1}$ is applied; this canonical calibration is the average value derived from observations of hundreds of standard submillimetre calibrators observed during the S2CLS campaign \\citep{Dempsey:2013qy}, and includes a 10\\% correction necessary to account for losses that occur due to the combination of filtering steps we apply to the data (see \\citealt{Geach:2013kx}). The flux calibration is expected to be accurate to within 15\\%.\n\nThe final matched-filtered map has a noise of 0.82\\,mJy beam$^{-1}$ at the deepest part and better than $\\le 1.3$\\,mJy rms over a $\\sim$\\,1.0 degree$^2$ (a $\\sim$1.1 degree diameter circle). The coverage is relatively uniform and the median depth within this region is 0.89\\,mJy beam$^{-1}$  (\\autoref{s2clsuds}). \n\nWe apply a simple source detection and extraction algorithm, described in more detail in Geach et al. (2015 in prep). In brief, we apply a top-down detection algorithm, first identifying the peak-pixel in the SNR map, recording position and flux and instrumental RMS and then subtracting a peak-scaled model of the PSF at this position. The next peak value is identified and the process repeated until a floor SNR threshold is met, which we set to 3.5\\,$\\sigma$.\n\nIn total we detect 1088 submillimeter sources at $\\geq$ 3.5\\,$\\sigma$ within the region where rms noise is $\\le $\\,1.3\\,mJy beam$^{-1}$. We define a {\\sc main} sample of 716 submillimeter sources that have $\\ge$ 4.0\\,$\\sigma$, for which we expect a false detection rate of $\\sim$\\,1\\% based on simulations and source extractions on negative signals (Geach et al.\\ in prep.). We also define a {\\sc supplementary} sample of 372 submiliimeter sources that are detected at $3.5-4.0$\\,$\\sigma$ and have a false detection rate of $\\sim$10\\%. In this paper, we provide counterpart candidates for both {\\sc main} and {\\sc supplementary} samples, however the scientific analyses were performed on the {\\sc main} sample. \n\nThe maps are corrected for astrometry by adopting a shift of 0$\\farcs$67 in R.A.\\ and $-$2$\\farcs$33 in Decl., based on stacking of the 850\\,$\\mu$m maps at the location of the radio sources. We have also stacked on the 850\\,$\\mu$m maps centered on the MIPS and $K$-band sources and found consistent results.\n\n\\subsection{ALMA}\nWe have carried out ALMA follow-up observations at 870\\,$\\mu$m on 30 of the brighter SCUBA-2 sources in a Cycle-1 project 2012.1.00090.S \\citep{Simpson:2015ab, Simpson:2015aa}. These sources were selected to have $S_{850} \\geq 8$\\,mJy from an earlier version of the S2CLS map, but the sensitivity of the map has since improved and as a result 27 of the 30 ALMA targets still remain in our {\\sc main} sample. Two of the three ALMA-observed sources that fall out of our {\\sc main} sample (UDS252, UDS421) have no detection in the high-resolution ALMA observations but both are detected in {\\it Herschel}/SPIRE imaging, while the remaining one (UDS298) is just below the 3.5\\,$\\sigma$ cut and the SCUBA-2 flux is consistent with the integrated flux of the two ALMA detections \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}. With a median rms of $\\sigma = $\\,0.26\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$, the primary ALMA catalog consists of 52 SMGs detected by ALMA at $> 4\\,\\sigma$, with a synthesized beam of $\\sim $\\,0$\\farcs$8 FWHM. Higher-resolution versions of the maps, with $\\sim$\\,0$\\farcs$3 FWHM, were used by \\citet{Simpson:2015aa} to study the  sizes and light profile of the brighter SMGs at 870\\,$\\mu$m, while the descriptions of the bright source counts and the data reduction and source extraction can be found in \\citet{Simpson:2015ab}. In this paper, we use these ALMA-detected SMGs as the training set to formulate our methodology to identify candidates counterpart for the rest of the SCUBA-2 SMG sample. Note that although the ALMA observations were conducted at a slightly different wavelength compared to the selection wavelength from SCUBA-2 (870\\,$\\mu$m versus 850\\,$\\mu$m), the difference in flux measurements is expected at $\\sim$5\\% level, which is negligible compared to the flux calibration error. Throughout this paper, we therefore denote $S_{850}$ as the fluxes that are measured at both 850\\,$\\mu$m and 870\\,$\\mu$m.\n\n\\subsection{Multi-wavelength ancillary data}\\label{sec:ancillary}\n\nThe $\\sim$\\,1 square degree UDS field contains a rich set of ancillary data. \\autoref{multicover} roughly outlines the coverage of each indicated waveband. \n\nThe $K$-band based multi-wavelength photometry adopted in this paper is based on the UDS data release 8 (DR8) of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS; \\citealt{Lawrence:2007aa}). The UDS field is the deepest of the five sub-surveys of UKIDSS, consisting of four Wide-Field Camera (WFCAM; \\citealt{Casali:2007aa}) pointings, covering 0.77 square degrees in $J$, $H$ and $K$ bands. The DR8 release contains all UDS data taken from 2005 to 2010. The 5\\,$\\sigma$ median depths are $J = $\\,24.9, $H =$\\,24.2 and $K =$\\,24.6 (in a 2$''$ diameter aperture). Detailed descriptions of mosaicing, catalogue extraction and depth estimation will be presented in Almaini et al.\\ (in preparation). After masking bad regions, removing bright stars and image artefacts produced by amplifier cross-talk, a $K$-band parent sample of a total of 159,871 sources was constructed for our analyses. \n\nThe UDS field was observed by the Subaru telescope using the Suprime-Cam in five broadband filters, $B$, $V$, $R_c$, $i'$, and $z'$, to the limiting depths of $B =$\\,28.4, $V =$\\,27.8, $R_c =$\\,27.7, $i' =$\\,27.7, and $z' =$\\,26.6, respectively (3\\,$\\sigma$, 2$''$ diameter apertures). Details of the Suprime-Cam survey are provided in \\citet{Furusawa:2008aa}.\nThe field was also covered by the Megacam $u'$-band on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), with a 5\\,$\\sigma$ depth reaching $u'=$\\,26.75 in a 2$''$ diameter aperture. The X-ray data were obtained as part of the Subaru-{\\it XMM/Newton} Deep Survey (SXDS), consisting of seven contiguous fields with a total exposure of 400\\,ks in the 0.2--10 keV band \\citep{Ueda:2008aa}. Finally, the UDS field was imaged in mid-infrared with IRAC and 24\\,$\\mu$m MIPS by the {\\it Spitzer} Legacy Program SpUDS. SpUDS data reach 5\\,$\\sigma$ depths of 24.2 and 24.0 AB magnitude at 3.6 and 4.5\\,$\\mu$m. \n\nEleven-band photometry ($UBVRIzJHK$[3.6][4.5]) was measured with 3$''$ diameter apertures placed on each aligned image at the position of the $K$-band sources, {motivated by the fact that $K$-band is generally a good stellar mass indicator that is less affected by dust compare to other optical/NIR bands, with a data quality that is deeper and has a higher angular resolution compare to that of the IRAC bands}. To account for the correlated noise that is not represented in the weight maps, the magnitude uncertainties estimated by {\\sc sextractor} are corrected by scaling the weight maps such that the uncertainty in source-free regions matches the rms measured from apertures placed on the science image. Three of the bands (the CFHT $u'$ band and the two IRAC channels) required aperture corrections to their photometry in order to obtain correct colors. This correction was performed based on smoothing the $K$-band images to the appropriate PSF and re-computing the aperture photometry to evaluate the expected changes. More details can be found in \\citet{Hartley:2013aa}.\n\nPhotometric redshifts ($z_{\\rm photo}$) have been derived for the DR8 parent sample, and the full description can be found in \\citet{Hartley:2013aa} and \\citet{Mortlock:2013aa}. In summary, the photometric \nredshifts are estimated using the {\\sc eazy} template-fitting package \\citep{Brammer:2008aa} through a maximum likelihood analysis. The default set of six templates does not sufficiently represent all of our galaxies, in particular the $u'$-band flux is significantly overestimated on the blue objects at high redshift. A seventh template is therefore constructed by applying a small amount of Small Magellanic Cloud-like extinction \\citep{Prevot:1984aa} to the bluest template in {\\sc eazy}. \n\nTo assess the accuracy of these photometric redshifts and to determine the cut on the $\\chi^2$ from the template-fitting, we compare the derived values to the spectroscopic redshifts ($z_{spec}$) that are available in the UDS. A large fraction of these $z_{spec}$ came from the UDSz, a European Southern Observatory large spectroscopic survey (ID:180.A-0776; Almaini et al., in preparation) and also from the literature (see \\citealt{Simpson:2012ab} and references therein). After excluding bright X-ray and radio sources that are likely to be AGNs \\citep{Simpson:2006aa, Ueda:2008aa}, there are 2,745 sources with measured spectroscopic redshifts ($z_{\\rm spec}$). If we only consider 2,461 sources that have $\\chi^2 < 10$ in the $z_{\\rm photo}$ fitting, we find a dispersion in $(z_{\\rm photo}-z_{\\rm spec})/(1+z_{\\rm spec})$, after excluding outliers ($\\Delta z/(1+z_{\\rm spec}) > 0.15$; $<$\\,4\\%), is $\\Delta z/(1+z_{\\rm spec}) \\sim$\\,0.02, slightly better than what was found in \\citet{Hartley:2013aa}. We therefore apply a $\\chi^2$ cut of ten in this paper. \n\n\nFor the 24-$\\mu$m MIPS image, we use {\\sc SExtractor} \\citep{Bertin:1996zr} to extract sources. Following \\citet{Shupe:2008aa}, the local background is estimated using a box with 128\\,$\\times$\\,128 pixels with a pixel size of 1$\\farcs$2, which then is used to weight the source extraction. Given MIPS has a beam FWHM of $\\sim$\\,6$''$ at 24\\,$\\mu$m, we expect most extragalactic sources to be unresolved and so appear as point sources. We thus set the detection threshold to be 20 connected $\\geq $\\,2\\,$\\sigma$ pixels (1 beam area). This selection corresponds to a $\\sim$\\,4\\,$\\sigma$ point source detection. In total we detect 12,127 24\\,$\\mu$m sources within the SCUBA-2 coverage. We estimate the number of false detections by inverting the map and extracting the negative sources using the same detection parameters. We find the false detection rate to be 0.03$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$\\%, consistent with a $\\sim$\\,4\\,$\\sigma$ detection, which increases to 0.1\\% if we account for sources close to the edge of the 24\\,$\\mu$m map. We measure photometry in a 15$''$-diameter \naperture. We estimate the aperture correction by median stacking the unsaturated bright stars and compute the curve of growth. We find an aperture correction factor of 1.5, consistent with the MIPS maps in the SWIRE fields \\citep{Shupe:2008aa}. The 1\\,$\\sigma$ uncertainty is 24\\,$\\mu$Jy, estimated using a 7$\\farcs$5-radius \naperture in the source-free regions.\n\n\nThe VLA radio observations at 1.4\\,GHz (20\\,cm) were carried out by the project UDS20 (Arumugam et al. in preparation), which comprises a mosaic of 14 pointings covering a total area of $\\sim$\\,1.3 degrees$^2$ centered on the UDS. All but two $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ SCUBA-2 sources are covered by the VLA map (\\autoref{multicover}). The total integration time is $\\sim$\\,160\\,hrs in A, B, and C--D configurations, yielding a nearly constant rms noise of $\\sim$\\,10\\,$\\mu$Jy across the full field ($< $\\,8$\\mu$Jy at the field center) and a beam size of 1$\\farcs$8 FWHM. A total of $\\sim$\\,7,000 sources are detected above 4\\,$\\sigma$.\nThe full descriptions of the observations, data reductions, and the catalog are presented in V.\\ Arumugam et al.\\ (in preparation). \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{fig2.pdf}\n       \\caption{Multi-wavelengths coverage of $K$-band, {\\it Spitzer}, and VLA in the UDS field, overlaid on the SCUBA-2 field shown as the black background.

A matched is typically considered reliable if $p < 0.05$ (e.g., \\citealt{Ivison:2002uq, Pope:2006p8076, Chapin:2009aa, Yun:2012aa})\n\nWe investigate the accuracy and completeness of the radio counterpart identifications for ALMA-detected SMGs that are located within the ALMA primary beam (8$\\farcs$7). To account for all possible counterparts to the single-dish submillimeter sources, we do not scale our search radius as a function of the SCUBA-2 detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in calculating $p$-values, as has been done in some previous work (e.g., \\citealt{Biggs:2011uq}). This is motivated by studies showing that due to the fact that single-dish detected SMGs tend to break into multiple sub-components in high-resolution follow-up observations, the separation between the sub-components and the corresponding single-dish source does not correlate with the SNR of the single-dish detection \\citep{Hodge:2013lr}. This result suggests that employing a fixed search radius, instead of a SNR dependent radius, during the process of identifying candidate counterparts may be a better strategy. Note though, \\citet{Simpson:2015ab} found that by convolving the ALMA maps with the SCUBA-2 beam, the radial separation between the convolved ALMA map centroid and the SCUBA-2 source is indeed a function of the SNR of the SCUBA-2 detection and consistent with Gaussian distribution.\n\nAmong the 52 ALMA SMGs in the training set, we found 27 that have radio counterparts matched to 1$\\farcs$5. While all 27 of them have $p < $\\,0.1, 23 have $p < $\\,0.05 (the canonical value used in the literature to select ``robust'' SMG counterparts). On the other hand, if we look at all the 30 radio sources located within the ALMA primary beam, 24 of them have $p < $\\,0.05. As a result, the accuracy of identifying SMG counterparts using radio sources with $p < $\\,0.05 is 92$^{+8}_{-27}$\\%(22/24)\\footnote[15]{Two ALMA SMGs, UDS\\,156.0 and UDS\\,156.1, are matched to the same radio source.}, and that by using all radio sources (in this case $p < $\\,0.1) is only slightly lower at 87$^{+13}_{-23}$\\% (26/30). In fact, the accuracy ranges between 85\\% to 100\\% if we adopt any choice of $p$ below $p=$\\,0.1 as the selection criterion, with no statistical difference (\\autoref{pstat}). Although the accuracy is indeed lower for radio identified counterpart with $p=$\\,0.05--0.1 at 66$^{+34}_{-43}$\\%, the result  suffers from small number statistics and the difference is insignificant. In addition, these high-$p$ sources are generally located further away from the pointing center (the centroid of the SCUBA-2 source), and the decrease in ALMA sensitivity for these sources due to primary beam coverage could be the cause of this slight but insignificant drop in accuracy. \n\n\nOn the other hand, we find that the majority (88$^{+12}_{-25}$\\%; 23/26) of the ALMA-confirmed radio identifications are the primary SMGs in the ALMA maps, defined as those brightest ALMA detections, which are found to dominate and contribute on average $\\sim$\\,75\\% of the total flux measured by SCUBA-2 \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}, although 18$\\pm$9\\% (5/28) of the primaries are not detected in the radio imaging.\n\nIn summary, \nwe conclude that, at $p<0.1$ the accuracy of the radio identifications does not appear to depend on the $p$-value, and taking all radio sources within the ALMA primary beam as the SMG counterparts actually yields better completeness (27 out of 52; 52$\\pm$12\\%) and an overall identification performance by maximising the product of accuracy and completeness.  \n\n\\subsection{MIPS 24$\\mu$m identifications}\\label{subsec:mips}\n\nWe conduct a similar test of the $p$-value method using the 24-$\\mu$m MIPS counterparts. We found that of the 52 ALMA SMGs there are 21 that have MIPS counterparts matched to within 2$''$, and among them 10 have $p < $\\,0.05. There are 27 MIPS sources in total located within the ALMA primary beams of the 30 submillimeter sources, 14 of which have $p < $\\,0.05. The percentage of $p < $\\,0.05 MIPS sources which are confirmed SMGs is 71$^{+29}_{-30}$\\% (10/14), and that of all MIPS sources is 78$^{+22}_{-23}$\\% (21/27). This is a slightly lower rate than for the radio, reflecting the different strengths of the correlations between the radio and mid-IR emission to the far-IR/submillimeter, as well as the differing levels of contaminations from foreground populations.  Moreover, the FWHM of the 24\\,$\\mu$m MIPS images is 6$''$, much worse than that of the radio maps, and in this case source blending becomes an issue. Deciding to what extent to match MIPS sources to the ALMA SMGs is not straightforward. By expanding the matching radius to 3$''$, almost all (24/27) MIPS sources are matched to at least one ALMA-identified SMG. However, we find that by detailed comparison of the images some of these MIPS sources are not correct counterparts. For this reason we chose 2$''$ as a good balance to match most of the obviously correct counterparts without including many spurious ones. In the right panels of \\autoref{pstat} we show that, similar to the radio counterparts, the accuracy of the MIPS counterparts does not depend on the $p$ values, and again, the completeness is significantly improved if one includes all MIPS sources that are located within the ALMA primary beam. We stress that changing the matching radius does not affect this result. \n\n\\subsection{Optical-IR Triple Color (OIRTC)}\\label{subsec:oir}\n\nPrevious studies have shown that SMGs are in general red in optical-near-infrared (OIR) colors such as $i-K$, $J-K$(DRGs), $K-[4.5]$ (KIEROs) (e.g., \\citealt{Smail:2002p6793, Dannerbauer:2004aa, Frayer:2004fk, Wang:2012ys}), suggesting high-$z$ and dusty nature. OIR color cuts had therefore been used to identify potential counterparts (e.g., \\citealt{Michaowski:2012aa}). However, while adopting single color cuts might select SMGs, the contaminations from the field sources can also be large. Color-color cuts, or characteristic density distribution, based on the {\\it Spitzer} mid-IR observations have been proposed and used \\citep{Yun:2008vn, Alberts:2013aa, Umehata:2014aa}. However, the training set for the mid-IR color-color techniques are heterogeneous, usually mixing with radio-, CO-, or SMA-identified SMGs, and the true accuracy and completeness of each technique are hard to understand. Armed with our ALMA data, which are based on a flux-limited SCUBA-2 sample, we can start looking into the best method using OIR colors to select SMGs counterparts. \n\nTo separate SMGs from non-SMG field galaxies using multi-wavelength photometry, we constructed a training set based on the results of our ALMA follow-up observations, which targeted 30 brighter SMGs selected in the UKIDSS-UDS field. We first selected all $K$-band sources located within the ALMA primary beam (17$\\farcs$4 FWHM) centred on the ALMA pointings, we then matched the $K$-band sources to the ALMA-detected SMGs presented in \\citet{Simpson:2015ab} to within 1$''$ radius. By excluding one ALMA-detected SMG that is likely to be lensed by a nearby foreground source and therefore has its photometry contaminated (UDS286.0; \\citealt{Simpson:2015aa}), in total the training sample comprises 164 $K$-band sources, of which 30 out of 52 ($\\sim$60\\% of the ALMA-detected SMGs) have $S_{850} > $\\,1.5\\,mJy. However, taking the primary beam correction into account our ALMA observations are only sensitive to sources with $S_{850} \\geq $\\,2.7\\,mJy across the full ALMA primary beam. To make a clean comparison and to derive our model to separate SMGs from field galaxies, out of the 30 SMGs in the training sample, we only include the 22 that have S$_{850} \\geq$\\,2.7\\,mJy as SMGs, and the rest with $S_{850} <$\\,2.7\\,mJy are regarded as part of the non-SMG comparison sample. \n\nOne way to identify possible parameters that can be used to separate SMGs from non-SMG field galaxies is to search for correlations between $S_{850}$ and the chosen parameters. In order to do so we use the maximal information coefficient (MIC) statistics of the MINE package \\citep{Reshef:2011aa} to determine the relative strength of the correlations between $S_{850}$ and the other source colors (for both ALMA-detected and -undetected sources), and to identify the primary criteria that isolate SMG counterparts from the contaminating field population located within the ALMA primary beam. The advantage of MIC over other correlation coefficient (such as Pearson and Spearman) is that it can identify non-linear relationship types , such as exponential or sinusoidal relation \\citep{Reshef:2011aa}. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{fig5.pdf}\n       \\caption{Rest-frame $UVJ$ diagram for $z>1$ sources.

Note that we only consider measurements that have at least 3\\,$\\sigma$ detections in both bands used in the color. \nThe best correlation is found in the $(z-K)$ color, followed by $([3.6]-[4.5])$, $(K-[3.6])$, $(B-z)$, $(V-J)$, and $(U-V)$ \\footnote[16]{We also note that the MIC analysis identifies radio emission as a powerful indicator of the correct ALMA counterpart, while indicating that MIPS 24\\,$\\mu$m emission provides no statistically compelling indication of the correct identification.}. In \\autoref{colorhist} we compare the histogram of the SMGs and the non-SMG comparisons in each color. Indeed, the better the correlation in the MIC statistics, the better the separation between the two populations, as revealed in the higher fractions of SMGs in the redder colors, quantitatively expressed as the SMG fraction ($f_{\\rm OIRTC}$). $f_{i, \\rm OIRTC} = N_{i, \\rm SMG}/N_i$ corresponds to the fraction of SMGs to the total number of sources in each color bin $i$. The errors of $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$ are estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, in which we derive standard deviation of SMG fraction with 100 realisations of randomly populated data points based on their measured colors and errors, and the results are shown in the upper panels of \\autoref{colorhist}. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig6.pdf}\n       \\caption{Triple-color ({\\it top-left}) or color-color diagrams in $z-K$, $K-[3.6]$, and $[3.6]-[4.5]$.

The top and left panels in the color-color diagrams are histrograms in each specified color, normalized to the total number of sources in each category, with assigned colors that are the same as those in \\autoref{colorhist}. The SMGs are distinctively red compare to the non-SMG field sources in all three colors.

At a typical SMG redshift, $z\\sim$\\,2, these colors correspond to roughly rest frame $(U-R)$, $(R-J)$, and $(J-H)$, suggesting both the Balmer/4000 \\AA\\, break and dust extinction could be the cause of SMGs being red in these colors \\citep{Simpson:2014aa}. Indeed, in \\autoref{uvj} we plot the rest-frame $UVJ$ color diagram of the UDS sample along with the sources that are selected based on these three OIR colors (OIRTC; described below), and find that OIRTC-selected sources are located in the regions where high $A_V$ is expected. Moreover, $>99$\\% of the OIRTC-selected sources are located at $z>1$.\n\nNext, motivated by the distinct red color space that SMGs occupy in $(z-K)$, $(K-[3.6])$, and $([3.6]-[4.5])$, we plot three-dimensional (3D) color-color-color along with two-dimensional (2D) color-color diagrams in \\autoref{cccdiagram}. Interestingly, while the contamination fraction from the field sources is at best $\\sim$30\\% in the single color histograms (reddest bin in $z-K$; \\autoref{colorhist}), the 2D and 3D color diagram efficiently remove most of the contaminants, revealing the red nature of SMGs as they are mostly clustered in the reddest color space. We note that the fainter SMGs with $S_{850} < 2.7$\\,mJy have consistent colors to their brighter counterparts, except $[3.6]-[4.5]$, in which the fainter SMGs are bluer (median color 0.25$\\pm$0.03 versus 0.46$\\pm$0.04).\n\nTo select SMGs, by considering the product of accuracy and completeness, we propose a following triple-color cut\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 32450, "prevtext": "\nwhere $N_{\\rm selected}$ is the number of selected candidate counterparts based on the selection methods, $N_{\\rm confirmed}$ is the number of selected candidates that are actually confirmed by ALMA based on the training set, and $N_{\\rm total} = 52$ representing the total number of the ALMA-detected SMGs. The decision of the best strategy is made by maximising the product of both parameters, and the quoted errors are Poisson if not specifically stated.\n\n\\subsection{Radio identifications}\\label{subsec:radio}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=1]{fig4.pdf}\n       \\caption{{\\it Lower section in each sub-panel}: Histrograms in each specified color of the training sample, which are 164 $K$-band sources that are located within the primary beam of our 30 ALMA observations in the UDS \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}, with red representing the 22 SMGs with $S_{850} > $\\,2.7\\,mJy that have matches to the $K$-band sources within 1$''$.

This approach utilises the corrected-Poissonian probability, or the $p$-values, to estimate the likelihood of radio sources being a random chance association to the submillimeter sources.

By describing $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$ with model functions and calibrating the training set with those models, it is possible to determine cuts in a quantitative way. \n\nWe therefore first model $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$ as a function of color by fitting a functional form, parametrized as\n$ 1/(a + e^{-b(x-c)}) $, in which $x$ is the corresponding color. The parametrisation is similar to the Fermi--Dirac distribution, which provides an appropriate description to the distribution of the measured $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$, where the fraction on both sides of the color space converge, \nconnecting by a smooth transition in between. When the colors are very red, the function converges to $1/a$, and to 0 when the colors are very blue. The parameter $b$ describes the sharpness of the transition whereas the parameter $c$ gives the color at which the value equals $1/(a+1)$. The best fit forms of this function are shown in \\autoref{colormodel}, which all fit the distributions well ($\\chi^2 \\lesssim 1$), and we have confirmed that they are not sensitive to the chosen binning. \nThe fitting results are given in \\autoref{fit}\n\nBased on the best-fit parameterised model, we then calculate the weighted-mean SMG fraction, $\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle$, defined as\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 45821, "prevtext": "\nwhere $n$ represents the radio source density and $\\theta$ is the angular offset between the radio and the submillimeter source. A matched is typically considered reliable if $p < 0.05$ (e.g., \\citealt{Ivison:2002uq, Pope:2006p8076, Chapin:2009aa, Yun:2012aa})\n\nWe investigate the accuracy and completeness of the radio counterpart identifications for ALMA-detected SMGs that are located within the ALMA primary beam (8$\\farcs$7). To account for all possible counterparts to the single-dish submillimeter sources, we do not scale our search radius as a function of the SCUBA-2 detection signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in calculating $p$-values, as has been done in some previous work (e.g., \\citealt{Biggs:2011uq}). This is motivated by studies showing that due to the fact that single-dish detected SMGs tend to break into multiple sub-components in high-resolution follow-up observations, the separation between the sub-components and the corresponding single-dish source does not correlate with the SNR of the single-dish detection \\citep{Hodge:2013lr}. This result suggests that employing a fixed search radius, instead of a SNR dependent radius, during the process of identifying candidate counterparts may be a better strategy. Note though, \\citet{Simpson:2015ab} found that by convolving the ALMA maps with the SCUBA-2 beam, the radial separation between the convolved ALMA map centroid and the SCUBA-2 source is indeed a function of the SNR of the SCUBA-2 detection and consistent with Gaussian distribution.\n\nAmong the 52 ALMA SMGs in the training set, we found 27 that have radio counterparts matched to 1$\\farcs$5. While all 27 of them have $p < $\\,0.1, 23 have $p < $\\,0.05 (the canonical value used in the literature to select ``robust'' SMG counterparts). On the other hand, if we look at all the 30 radio sources located within the ALMA primary beam, 24 of them have $p < $\\,0.05. As a result, the accuracy of identifying SMG counterparts using radio sources with $p < $\\,0.05 is 92$^{+8}_{-27}$\\%(22/24)\\footnote[15]{Two ALMA SMGs, UDS\\,156.0 and UDS\\,156.1, are matched to the same radio source.}, and that by using all radio sources (in this case $p < $\\,0.1) is only slightly lower at 87$^{+13}_{-23}$\\% (26/30). In fact, the accuracy ranges between 85\\% to 100\\% if we adopt any choice of $p$ below $p=$\\,0.1 as the selection criterion, with no statistical difference (\\autoref{pstat}). Although the accuracy is indeed lower for radio identified counterpart with $p=$\\,0.05--0.1 at 66$^{+34}_{-43}$\\%, the result  suffers from small number statistics and the difference is insignificant. In addition, these high-$p$ sources are generally located further away from the pointing center (the centroid of the SCUBA-2 source), and the decrease in ALMA sensitivity for these sources due to primary beam coverage could be the cause of this slight but insignificant drop in accuracy. \n\n\nOn the other hand, we find that the majority (88$^{+12}_{-25}$\\%; 23/26) of the ALMA-confirmed radio identifications are the primary SMGs in the ALMA maps, defined as those brightest ALMA detections, which are found to dominate and contribute on average $\\sim$\\,75\\% of the total flux measured by SCUBA-2 \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}, although 18$\\pm$9\\% (5/28) of the primaries are not detected in the radio imaging.\n\nIn summary, \nwe conclude that, at $p<0.1$ the accuracy of the radio identifications does not appear to depend on the $p$-value, and taking all radio sources within the ALMA primary beam as the SMG counterparts actually yields better completeness (27 out of 52; 52$\\pm$12\\%) and an overall identification performance by maximising the product of accuracy and completeness.  \n\n\\subsection{MIPS 24$\\mu$m identifications}\\label{subsec:mips}\n\nWe conduct a similar test of the $p$-value method using the 24-$\\mu$m MIPS counterparts. We found that of the 52 ALMA SMGs there are 21 that have MIPS counterparts matched to within 2$''$, and among them 10 have $p < $\\,0.05. There are 27 MIPS sources in total located within the ALMA primary beams of the 30 submillimeter sources, 14 of which have $p < $\\,0.05. The percentage of $p < $\\,0.05 MIPS sources which are confirmed SMGs is 71$^{+29}_{-30}$\\% (10/14), and that of all MIPS sources is 78$^{+22}_{-23}$\\% (21/27). This is a slightly lower rate than for the radio, reflecting the different strengths of the correlations between the radio and mid-IR emission to the far-IR/submillimeter, as well as the differing levels of contaminations from foreground populations.  Moreover, the FWHM of the 24\\,$\\mu$m MIPS images is 6$''$, much worse than that of the radio maps, and in this case source blending becomes an issue. Deciding to what extent to match MIPS sources to the ALMA SMGs is not straightforward. By expanding the matching radius to 3$''$, almost all (24/27) MIPS sources are matched to at least one ALMA-identified SMG. However, we find that by detailed comparison of the images some of these MIPS sources are not correct counterparts. For this reason we chose 2$''$ as a good balance to match most of the obviously correct counterparts without including many spurious ones. In the right panels of \\autoref{pstat} we show that, similar to the radio counterparts, the accuracy of the MIPS counterparts does not depend on the $p$ values, and again, the completeness is significantly improved if one includes all MIPS sources that are located within the ALMA primary beam. We stress that changing the matching radius does not affect this result. \n\n\\subsection{Optical-IR Triple Color (OIRTC)}\\label{subsec:oir}\n\nPrevious studies have shown that SMGs are in general red in optical-near-infrared (OIR) colors such as $i-K$, $J-K$(DRGs), $K-[4.5]$ (KIEROs) (e.g., \\citealt{Smail:2002p6793, Dannerbauer:2004aa, Frayer:2004fk, Wang:2012ys}), suggesting high-$z$ and dusty nature. OIR color cuts had therefore been used to identify potential counterparts (e.g., \\citealt{Michaowski:2012aa}). However, while adopting single color cuts might select SMGs, the contaminations from the field sources can also be large. Color-color cuts, or characteristic density distribution, based on the {\\it Spitzer} mid-IR observations have been proposed and used \\citep{Yun:2008vn, Alberts:2013aa, Umehata:2014aa}. However, the training set for the mid-IR color-color techniques are heterogeneous, usually mixing with radio-, CO-, or SMA-identified SMGs, and the true accuracy and completeness of each technique are hard to understand. Armed with our ALMA data, which are based on a flux-limited SCUBA-2 sample, we can start looking into the best method using OIR colors to select SMGs counterparts. \n\nTo separate SMGs from non-SMG field galaxies using multi-wavelength photometry, we constructed a training set based on the results of our ALMA follow-up observations, which targeted 30 brighter SMGs selected in the UKIDSS-UDS field. We first selected all $K$-band sources located within the ALMA primary beam (17$\\farcs$4 FWHM) centred on the ALMA pointings, we then matched the $K$-band sources to the ALMA-detected SMGs presented in \\citet{Simpson:2015ab} to within 1$''$ radius. By excluding one ALMA-detected SMG that is likely to be lensed by a nearby foreground source and therefore has its photometry contaminated (UDS286.0; \\citealt{Simpson:2015aa}), in total the training sample comprises 164 $K$-band sources, of which 30 out of 52 ($\\sim$60\\% of the ALMA-detected SMGs) have $S_{850} > $\\,1.5\\,mJy. However, taking the primary beam correction into account our ALMA observations are only sensitive to sources with $S_{850} \\geq $\\,2.7\\,mJy across the full ALMA primary beam. To make a clean comparison and to derive our model to separate SMGs from field galaxies, out of the 30 SMGs in the training sample, we only include the 22 that have S$_{850} \\geq$\\,2.7\\,mJy as SMGs, and the rest with $S_{850} <$\\,2.7\\,mJy are regarded as part of the non-SMG comparison sample. \n\nOne way to identify possible parameters that can be used to separate SMGs from non-SMG field galaxies is to search for correlations between $S_{850}$ and the chosen parameters. In order to do so we use the maximal information coefficient (MIC) statistics of the MINE package \\citep{Reshef:2011aa} to determine the relative strength of the correlations between $S_{850}$ and the other source colors (for both ALMA-detected and -undetected sources), and to identify the primary criteria that isolate SMG counterparts from the contaminating field population located within the ALMA primary beam. The advantage of MIC over other correlation coefficient (such as Pearson and Spearman) is that it can identify non-linear relationship types , such as exponential or sinusoidal relation \\citep{Reshef:2011aa}. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{fig5.pdf}\n       \\caption{Rest-frame $UVJ$ diagram for $z>1$ sources. The red points represent the sources that are selected by the OIRTC technique, and the grey-scale background shows the density of the field galaxies in UDS, with higher density corresponding to darker color. \tNote that the pattern of the distribution is quantized due to the {\\sc eazy} template fitting for deriving $z_{\\rm photo}$ (\\autoref{sec:ancillary}).\n       This is to show that majority of the OIRTC-selected sources are at $z>1$ and occupies the color regions in which high dust extinction is expected. \n       }\n    \\label{uvj}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe select the following colors to search for correlations to $S_{850}$ (assigning zero flux to non-SMG comparisons): $(U-V)$, $(V-J)$, $(B-z)$, $(z-K)$, $(K-[3.6])$, $([3.6]-[4.5])$. Note that we only consider measurements that have at least 3\\,$\\sigma$ detections in both bands used in the color. \nThe best correlation is found in the $(z-K)$ color, followed by $([3.6]-[4.5])$, $(K-[3.6])$, $(B-z)$, $(V-J)$, and $(U-V)$ \\footnote[16]{We also note that the MIC analysis identifies radio emission as a powerful indicator of the correct ALMA counterpart, while indicating that MIPS 24\\,$\\mu$m emission provides no statistically compelling indication of the correct identification.}. In \\autoref{colorhist} we compare the histogram of the SMGs and the non-SMG comparisons in each color. Indeed, the better the correlation in the MIC statistics, the better the separation between the two populations, as revealed in the higher fractions of SMGs in the redder colors, quantitatively expressed as the SMG fraction ($f_{\\rm OIRTC}$). $f_{i, \\rm OIRTC} = N_{i, \\rm SMG}/N_i$ corresponds to the fraction of SMGs to the total number of sources in each color bin $i$. The errors of $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$ are estimated through Monte Carlo simulations, in which we derive standard deviation of SMG fraction with 100 realisations of randomly populated data points based on their measured colors and errors, and the results are shown in the upper panels of \\autoref{colorhist}. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig6.pdf}\n       \\caption{Triple-color ({\\it top-left}) or color-color diagrams in $z-K$, $K-[3.6]$, and $[3.6]-[4.5]$. The large circles are SMGs, color-scaled based on their $S_{850}$, and blue dots are field sources. The top and left panels in the color-color diagrams are histrograms in each specified color, normalized to the total number of sources in each category, with assigned colors that are the same as those in \\autoref{colorhist}. The SMGs are distinctively red compare to the non-SMG field sources in all three colors. The proposed color cuts (dashed lines) are given in \\autoref{subsec:oir}.\n       }\n    \\label{cccdiagram}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nIn the three best correlated colors $(z-K)$, $(K-[3.6])$, and $([3.6]-[4.5])$, SMGs are mostly located in the redder part of the color space. At a typical SMG redshift, $z\\sim$\\,2, these colors correspond to roughly rest frame $(U-R)$, $(R-J)$, and $(J-H)$, suggesting both the Balmer/4000 \\AA\\, break and dust extinction could be the cause of SMGs being red in these colors \\citep{Simpson:2014aa}. Indeed, in \\autoref{uvj} we plot the rest-frame $UVJ$ color diagram of the UDS sample along with the sources that are selected based on these three OIR colors (OIRTC; described below), and find that OIRTC-selected sources are located in the regions where high $A_V$ is expected. Moreover, $>99$\\% of the OIRTC-selected sources are located at $z>1$.\n\nNext, motivated by the distinct red color space that SMGs occupy in $(z-K)$, $(K-[3.6])$, and $([3.6]-[4.5])$, we plot three-dimensional (3D) color-color-color along with two-dimensional (2D) color-color diagrams in \\autoref{cccdiagram}. Interestingly, while the contamination fraction from the field sources is at best $\\sim$30\\% in the single color histograms (reddest bin in $z-K$; \\autoref{colorhist}), the 2D and 3D color diagram efficiently remove most of the contaminants, revealing the red nature of SMGs as they are mostly clustered in the reddest color space. We note that the fainter SMGs with $S_{850} < 2.7$\\,mJy have consistent colors to their brighter counterparts, except $[3.6]-[4.5]$, in which the fainter SMGs are bluer (median color 0.25$\\pm$0.03 versus 0.46$\\pm$0.04).\n\nTo select SMGs, by considering the product of accuracy and completeness, we propose a following triple-color cut\n\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation*}\n(z-K) > 1.1 \\wedge (K-[3.6]) > {1.25} \\wedge ([3.6]-[4.5]) > 0.22\n\\end{equation*}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"(z-K)&gt;1.1\\wedge(K-[3.6])&gt;{1.25}\\wedge([3.6]-[4.5])&gt;0.22\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>z</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>K</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mrow><mn>1.1</mn><mo>\u2227</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mn>3.6</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mrow><mn>1.25</mn><mo>\u2227</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mn>3.6</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mn>4.5</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0.22</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02630.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nwhere $i = z-K, K-[3.6], [3.6]-[4.5]$ and $W_i = N_i/\\sigma_i^2$ represents the weight of each color, and $N_i = 148, 161$ and 147, respectively, is the number of available measurements in the training set for each color.

Interestingly, although we only used SMGs with $S_{850} \\geq$\\,2.7\\,mJy to derive models of the SMG fraction, the model is equally successful in identifying fainter SMGs, in which 75\\% (6/8) are above the cut. While tentative evidence of bluer colors for SMGs with $S_{850} \\lesssim 1$\\,mJy has been reported by \\citet{Hatsukade:2015aa}, we find that in the S$_{850} {\\mathrel{\\raise0.35ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle >$}\\kern-0.6em \t\t\\lower0.40ex\\hbox{{$\\scriptstyle \\sim$}}}} 1$\\,mJy regime there is no strong color variations among SMGs with different fluxes. Furthermore, those non-SMG comparisons with high $\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle$ could also be faint SMGs with $S_{850} < $\\,2.7\\,mJy that are undetected by ALMA because they are located in the outskirts of the ALMA pointings where the sensitivity is slightly poorer. \n\nIn summary, the OIRTC technique performs slightly better to the triple-color cut in both accuracy and completeness, although subject to the size of the training sample the differences are not statistically significant. We nevertheless adopt the OIRTC technique as the main method for selecting SMGs using optical-infrared colors as it performs the best in the training set. We note that our basic results are not sensitive to the chosen method.\n\n\n\\subsection{Our methodology: Radio+OIRTC identifications}\\label{subsec:radpoirtc}\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\caption{Test results using the ALMA training sample}\n\t\t\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\t\t\t\\toprule\n\t\t\tMethod   &  Accuracy  &  Completeness   \\\\\n\t\t\t\\midrule\n\t\t\tRadio  &  87$^{+13}_{-23}$\\% (26/30)   \t & 52$\\pm$12\\% (27/52)       \\\\\n\t\t\tMIPS  &  78$^{+22}_{-23}$\\% (21/27) \t& 40$\\pm$10\\% (21/52)      \\\\\n\t\t\tOIRTC & 87$^{+13}_{-23}$\\% (27/31)   \t& 52$\\pm$12\\% (27/52)   \\\\\n\t\t\tRadio+OIRTC & 83$^{+17}_{-19}$\\% (35/42)   \t& 67$\\pm$14\\% (35/52)   \\\\\n\t\t\t\\bottomrule\n\t\t\\end{tabular}\n\\label{test}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe test results shown in \\autoref{subsec:radio}, \\autoref{subsec:mips}, and \\autoref{subsec:oir} are summarized in \\autoref{test}, which demonstrate that the accuracy of both radio and OIRTC identification is 87\\%, while the MIPS identification is less accurate, with an additional issue of larger positional uncertainty. In addition, as hinted in \\autoref{score}, the radio and OIRTC selection compliment each other in identifying SMGs in different flux ranges -- at S$_{850} >6$\\,mJy five SMGs can only be identified by radio, while all the SMGs that can be selected by OIRTC technique, but are missed in radio, have S$_{850} < 6$\\,mJy.\n\nIn \\autoref{s850hist} we plot 850\\,$\\mu$m flux distribution of the ALMA SMGs, in which the sub-samples of SMGs identified by different methods are highlighted. Indeed, we find that while the radio sources preferentially identify brighter SMGs, the color analysis picks up fainter ones, and MIPS-identified SMGs have $S_{850}$ in between, as revealed in the median flux of SMGs each method identifies. By combining the radio sources and the OIRTC technique we are able to identify 35 out of 52 ALMA SMGs (67$\\pm$14\\% completeness), with the accuracy of 83$^{+17}_{-19}$\\% (35/42). We emphasize that of all the 52 ALMA-detected SMGs, 14 have no counterpart in any of our ancillary images. In other words, the radio+OIRTC can identify all but three (92\\%; 35/38) ALMA SMGs that are possible to be identified in other wavebands. We also find that all but one of the MIPS-identified SMGs can be selected through either radio or optical-IR color. In addition to the lower positional accuracy of MIPS sources, adding them into the counterpart selection method does not provide better results considering both accuracy and completeness. \n\nAs a result of this analysis, in this study we adopt the radio+OIRTC technique as our major tool to identify the candidate SMG counterparts of SCUBA-2 detected submillimeter sources. Operationally this involves us taking all the radio sources that are matched to the submillimeter sources to within 8$\\farcs$7, supplemented by the radio-undetected, $K$-selected sources identified using the OIRTC technique as candidate SMG counterparts. The chosen search radius of 8$\\farcs$7, based on the theoretical calculations assuming Gaussian distribution ($\\sigma \\sim 0.6({\\rm SNR})^{-1}$FWHM; \\citealt{Ivison:2007fj}), corresponds to a 4\\,$\\sigma$ positional uncertainty for a 4\\,$\\sigma$ SCUBA-2 detection (14$\\farcs$5 FWHM). The search radius of 8$\\farcs$7 also matches to our ALMA primary beam, within which the training set is obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{fig9.pdf}\n       \\caption{Histograms of $S_{850}$ for the 52 ALMA-detected SMGs in the UDS field from \\citet{Simpson:2015ab}.

The first sample of 12 is based on the SMA observations on 9 of our {\\sc main} SCUBA-2 sources (none overlaps with the ALMA targets). The rms noise ranges between $\\sigma = 1-2$\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$, with a synthesized beam $\\sim$2$''$ FWHM (Chapman et al.\\ in prep.). The second test sample is the ALESS {\\sc main} sample with 99 ALMA-detected SMGs, constructed by an ALMA follow-up study at 870\\,$\\mu$m on a flux-limited sample of 126 single-dish submillimeter sources detected on the LABOCA maps in the Extended {\\it Chandra} Deep Field South (ECDFS; \\citealt{Hodge:2013lr}). The ALESS observations have a median rms of $\\sigma \\sim $\\,0.4\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$, with a synthesized beam of $\\sim$1$\\farcs$6 FWHM. \n\nFor the SMA sample, by excluding one source that is associated with a {\\it Class} = 2 SCUBA-2 source (UDS.0010; although that source is accurately predicted by our identification method), we successfully identify 6 out of 11 sources (completeness = $55\\pm28$\\%) with an accuracy of $70^{+30}_{-34}$\\% (7/10). While the SMA sample might be too small, both completeness and accuracy are consistent with our training results.\n\nTo compare to the second test sample, we first take the IRAC-based photometric catalog of sources in ECDF-S from \\citet{Simpson:2014aa}. This includes 13-band photometry from the U-band to 8\\,$\\mu$m and derived photometric redshifts using {\\sc hyperz} \\citep{Bolzonella:2000aa} for $\\sim$\\,45,000 sources in the whole field. We then take those sources lying within the ALMA primary beam centred at the positions of the 88 LESS submillimeter sources from \\citet{Weis:2009qy} for which there are good quality ALMA maps from \\citet{Hodge:2013lr}. This yields a total of 326 sources and we match these to the ALESS main sample to within 1$\\farcs$5 radius. This yields 64 ALESS SMGs with IRAC counterparts and 262 non-SMG sources. We also match to this catalogue the catalogue of 1.4\\,GHz VLA $\\geq $\\,5\\,$\\sigma$ radio sources from \\citet{Biggs:2011uq}. Finally we generate a counterpart candidate catalog based on our radio+OIRTC technique, in which we find an accuracy of {82$\\pm$17\\% (40/49)} and completeness of {40$\\pm$8\\% (40/99)}, which are consistent with the robust identifications based on the $p$-values presented in \\citet{Biggs:2011uq} \\citep{Hodge:2013lr}. \n\nThis test result is very encouraging considering that the OIRTC model is derived based on our $K$-selected training sample in UDS, completely different than the IRAC-selected photometric sample in ECDF-S, yet our empirical method yields matched results to that based on the $p$-values. {Perhaps more importantly, as the ALESS-SMGs have fainter 850\\,$\\mu$m fluxes (median flux of $S_{850}$=2.5\\,mJy versus $S_{850}$=4.2\\,mJy for the ALMA-UDS sample), the equally high success rate for the ALESS sample suggests that the radio properties and/or the OIR colors do not vary significantly as a function of 850\\,$\\mu$m fluxes. This result reassures us that our method does not suffer from a bias owing to the fact that the ALMA training sample is biased toward brighter SCUBA-2 sources.}\n\nA slightly lower completeness on ALESS, on the other hand, is caused by the fact that there are more fainter SMGs, which are more likely to have no detectable counterpart. {The finding of a different completeness in ALESS compare to that of our ALMA training sample also highlights the fact that the depth of the ancillary data affects the completeness of the identifications.}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{What are we missing?}\\label{sec:miss}\n\nBefore we proceed and discuss the scientific implications, it is important to understand what SMGs are missed by our identification process. In \\autoref{kcor} we plot the expected flux densities of an SMG as a function of redshift at 2.2\\,$\\mu$m, 24\\,$\\mu$m,  850\\,$\\mu$m and 20\\,cm. We adopt an SED shape based on the Cosmic Eyelash, a strongly lensed SMG with a typical intrinsic $S_{850}$ similar to that of the SMGs we are probing \\citep{Swinbank:2010p10277}, normalised to a total SFR of 500\\,M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$ (unlensed $S_{850}\\sim3$\\,mJy) assuming a Salpeter IMF. We also plot the results based on the composite rest-frame SED of the ALESS SMGs \\citep{Simpson:2014aa, Swinbank:2014ul}. \n\nFirst of all, as the SEDs are matched to the same $L_{IR}$, it is not surprising that both SEDs have similar 850\\,$\\mu$m and radio fluxes as a function of redshift. However, ALESS SMGs have brighter observed 24\\,$\\mu$m fluxes and bluer color in optical/NIR as shown in a shallower decrease on the observed 2.2\\,$\\mu$m flux. We attribute this effect to the selection bias. As shown in \\citet{Simpson:2014aa} and \\citet{Swinbank:2014ul}, by necessity the composite rest-frame SED of the ALESS SMGs can only be constructed for those sources that have well-constrained photometric redshifts, meaning they are preferentially brighter, especially in the optical/UV. In addition, the comparable detection limits in the optical-IR wavebands in the ECDFS (the location of the ALESS SMGs) biases the detection towards bluer SMGs. \n\n\\autoref{kcor} nicely illustrates that the negative $K$-correction of 850\\,$\\mu$m allows us to detect SMGs in a wide range of the redshift space \\citep{Blain:2002p8120}, while optical-IR and radio suffer from positive $K$-corrections. The main implication is that our methodology of identifying counterpart candidates using radio/OIR imaging is likely to miss the high-redshift SMGs, as seen in \\autoref{kcor} and many other studies in the literature (e.g., \\citealt{Walter:2012qy, Riechers:2013yq}). We are also likely to miss more faint SMGs than the bright ones, providing that the mean redshift of the faint SMGs is similar or higher than that of the bright ones (e.g., \\citealt{Chen:2014aa, Simpson:2014aa}), and the SEDs of the fainter SMGs do not differ significantly compared to the brighter ones. On the other hand, thanks to the deep $K$-band imaging available in UDS, given the same $L_{IR}$ higher-redshift SMGs are more likely to be detected in near-IR than in radio or at 24\\,$\\mu$m. Indeed, in \\autoref{sec:z} we show that our OIRTC technique identifies SMG counterparts that have redshift distributions skewed towards higher-redshifts compared to those with radio counterparts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{fig10.pdf}\n       \\caption{Expected flux densities in mJy as a function of redshift based on the SED of SMMJ2135-0102 (Cosmic Eyelash; \\citealt{Swinbank:2010p10277}) normalised to a total SFR of 500\\,M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.

For the {\\sc main} sample of 716 $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ submillimeter sources, we identify candidate counterparts to 498, from which 129 have two candidate SMG counterparts, 30 have three, and three submillimeter source have four SMG candidate counterparts. Example thumbnails on $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ submillimeter sources with $\\ge$3 counterpart candidate are shown in \\autoref{examplepostage}, and thumbnails for all the 1088 $\\geq3.5\\,\\sigma$ source can be found  in the appendix.\nTherefore we identify counterparts for 70$\\pm$4\\% (498/716) of the {\\sc main} SMG sample, and the fraction of sources having multiple candidate counterparts (multiple fraction) is 33$\\pm$3\\% (163/498).\n\nHowever, because not all the SCUBA-2 sources are covered by both radio and by more than three OIR wavebands needed for the OIRTC technique, each SCUBA-2 source is assigned to one of the three different classes, which are defined based on the following scheme.\n\n1.\t{\\it Class} = 1: within the search radius of $8\\farcs7$ from the SCUBA-2 position, sources that are covered by the radio imaging, and also qualified for the OIRTC technique (having at least two color measurements among $z-K$, $K-[3.6]$, $[3.6]-[4.5]$).\n\n\n2.\t{\\it Class} = 2: sources that are only covered by the radio imaging, but lack the coverage necessary for the OIRTC technique (or only have it in part of the region within the search radius).\n\n\n3.\t{\\it Class} = 3: sources that are not covered by the radio imaging, and not covered by the OIRTC technique either (or only covered in part of the region within the search radius).\n\nFor the 716 {\\sc main} SCUBA-2 sources, 523 are $Class=1$, 191 are {\\it Class} = 2 and 2 are {\\it Class} = 3, respectively, and their spatial distribution is shown in \\autoref{multicover}. For {\\it Class} = 1 sources we identify candidate counterparts to 421, from which 124 have two candidate SMG counterparts, 28 have three, and three submillimeter source have four SMG candidate counterparts. \nTherefore for $Class =1$ {\\sc main} sample we find an overall identification rate of 80$\\pm$5\\% (421/523) and a multiple fraction of 37$\\pm$3\\% (155/421). The numbers are much lower for {\\it Class} = 2 {\\sc main} sample, with an ID rate of $40\\pm5$\\% (77/191) and a multiple fraction of $9\\pm4$\\% (7/77). By construction there would be no ID for {\\it Class} = 3 sources.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.84]{fig11.pdf}\n       \\caption{False-color [3.6]-$K$-$z$ (r-g-b) thumbnails of example $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 submillimeter sources with three or four candidate SMG counterparts.

The solid squares and circles mark the counterpart candidates identified through OIRTC technique and radio imaging, respectively. We only show circles if sources are identified by both radio and OIRTC. The magenta points are ALMA-detected SMGs with the ID numbers adopted from \\citet{Simpson:2015ab}.

Therefore for the {\\it Class} = 1 sources, based on the training sample we expect the identification accuracy to be 82$\\pm$20\\% (31/38), and the completeness to be 69$\\pm$16\\% (31/45), while for the {\\it Class} = 2 sources where only radio coverage is available, based on \\autoref{subsec:radio} we expect an identification accuracy of 87$^{+13}_{-23}$ and a completeness of 52$\\pm$12\\%. However, because the training sample was selected from the typically brighter ($S_{850} > 8$\\,mJy) sources, the ALMA follow-up observations on the whole SCUBA-2 SMGs are likely to produce more fainter SMGs with $S_{850} < $\\,4\\,mJy than those in the training sample. We therefore expect the overall completeness to be less than the numbers quoted above. \n\n{To estimate the true completeness with our method on SMGs with $S_{850} > 1$\\,mJy that are located within the beam area of the SCUBA-2 sources, we assume that we have ALMA follow-up observations for the rest of the SCUBA-2 sample, and we model the results by assuming for each SCUBA-2 source a 40\\% chance that it breaks into two sub-components (see \\autoref{subsec:multiplicity} regarding the multiple fraction for the SCUBA-2 sources). We then assume that for those broken into sub-components, the flux contribution is 75\\% and 25\\% of the SCUBA-2 flux, respectively, based on \\citet{Simpson:2015ab}. We then apply the identification rate based on \\autoref{s850hist} to the model flux distribution, and compute the completeness by dividing the expected number of identifications to the total number of the model SMGs. We obtain a completeness of $\\sim$60\\%.}\n\n\nFor the 258 {\\it Class} = 1 submillimeter sources in the {\\sc supplementary} 3.5--4\\,$\\sigma$ sample, we find candidate counterparts to 166, with 39 having multiple counterparts. The slightly lower fractions in identification rate (64$\\pm$6\\%) and multiple fraction (23$\\pm$4\\%) in the tentative sample could be due to the expected higher spurious rate ($\\sim$\\,10\\%). The full identifications are given in \\autoref{tab:ids}.\n\nWe stress that our counterpart identification method is trained based on the ALMA follow-up observations on part of our sample SCUBA-2 SMGs in UDS, and aims to provide all counterpart candidates with $S_{850} > 1$\\,mJy.\n\n\n\\subsection{Identification rate and multiple fraction}\\label{subsec:multiplicity}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{fig12.pdf}\n       \\caption{{\\it Top}: The fraction of SCUBA-2 sources that have at least one candidate SMG counterpart (identification rate) in percentage as a function of measured $S_{850}$ for the submillimeter sources in the SCUBA-2 map.

First tentative evidence for multiplicity came from radio-identified counterparts (e.g., \\citealt{Ivison:2002uq}). Subsequently the true confirmation with submillimeter interferometry came from \\citet{Wang:2011p9293} and many other studies \\citep{Barger:2012lr, Barger:2014aa, Hodge:2013lr, Simpson:2015ab, Bussmann:2015aa}. However, these studies differ in the multiple fraction, which ranges from 10--70\\% depending on the depth of the follow-up observations \\citep{Chen:2013gq}. The most recent ALMA results suggest moderate multiplicity, $\\sim$\\,60\\% for submillimeter sources with $S_{850}\\sim$\\,8\\,mJy, with the primary source contributing on average $\\sim$\\,75\\% of the the total flux from the single-dish source \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}.  \n\nIn \\autoref{idrate} we also show our results on the multiple fraction to the $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 sample. We find a constant multiple fraction of $\\sim$\\,40\\% as a function of 850\\,$\\mu$m flux, with a positive (but not significant) slope. While the ALMA imaging reveals multiple fractions in broad agreement with ours, a noticeable but not significant increase (decrease) can be seen in the brightest (faintest) bin, making a correlation between multiple fraction and 850\\,$\\mu$m flux from SCUBA-2 slightly more significant. This can be explained by the fact that, in the multiple systems revealed by the ALMA imaging, many of the fainter companions have $S_{850} < $\\,3\\,mJy, making them unlikely to be identified through our method, or any other multiwavelength identification methods as they are usually undetected at almost all other wavelengths. On the other hand, a slightly lower multiple fraction in the faintest bin can be explained by the sensitivity of the ALMA imaging. The median sensitivity of the ALMA observations is 0.26\\,mJy beam$^{-1}$, providing a 4\\,$\\sigma$ detection limit of $\\sim$1\\,mJy in the central region, and 2\\,mJy within the primary beam. Assuming that the secondary sources contribute to 25\\% of the total SCUBA-2 flux \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}, the ALMA observations can detect the secondary SMGs for SCUBA-2 sources with $S_{850} > $\\,8\\,mJy. For SCUBA-2 sources fainter than $S_{850} < $\\,8\\,mJy, the ALMA observations are not sensitive enough to detect the secondary sources if located close to the edge of the primary beam, biasing the fraction towards a lower multiple value. We conclude that, for follow-up observations that are sensitive to $S_{850} \\sim$1\\,mJy across the whole ALMA beam area, the true multiple fraction for single-dish submillimeter sources with 850\\,$\\mu$m fluxes of $S_{850} {\\mathrel{\\raise0.35ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle >$}\\kern-0.6em \t\t\\lower0.40ex\\hbox{{$\\scriptstyle \\sim$}}}} $\\,4\\,mJy is likely to be higher than 40\\%.\n\n\n\\subsection{Redshift distribution}\\label{sec:z}\n\n\n\nIn \\autoref{zhist} we plot the redshift distribution of the counterpart candidates of the $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 sources, in which we also show the distribution of those that have radio counterparts, ALESS \\citep{Simpson:2014aa}, and our ALMA pilot study in UDS (Simpson et al.\\ in preparation). \n\nThe median redshift of the counterpart candidates of our $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 SMGs is $z=2.3\\pm0.1$, and that based on the radio identifications is $z=1.9\\pm0.1$. The median redshift of the ALMA-UDS sample is slightly higher at $z=2.7\\pm0.2$. The difference is not significant but this could suggest a dependency between 850\\,$\\mu$m flux and redshift, since the ALMA-UDS sample is much brighter. By conducting photometric redshift analysis on ALESS SMGs, \\citet{Simpson:2014aa} found a weak trend between 870\\,$\\mu$m flux and redshift. However, after accounting for the selection bias Simpson et al. conclude that the median redshift is likely not dependent on the 870\\,$\\mu$m flux. A weak positive or non-existing trend is in contrast with recent predictions by \\citet{Cowley:2015aa}, who based on their semi-analytic model predict a negative trend between 850\\,$\\mu$m flux and redshift. \n\nTo obtain errors of the redshift distribution, we perform Monte Carlo simulations based on both the Poisson statistics and uncertainties in the photometric redshifts. We take the errors estimated from the Monte Carlo simulations and fit the distribution with a lognormal function described as\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 48683, "prevtext": "\n\nwhere $\\wedge$ is the logical {\\sc and} symbol. This triple-color cut works the best if the source has at least two color measurements. Based on the training sample, the triple-color cut successfully selects a SMG in 86$^{+14}_{-24}$\\% (24/28) of the time and has a completeness of 46$\\pm$11\\% (24/52). \n\nWhile color cuts are easy to adopt, they do not consider information on the errors in the color measurements and the selected cuts are somewhat arbitrary. Below we employ a different approach, the OIRTC technique, that accounts for the uncertainties of the color measurements and define cuts in a quantitative way.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig7.pdf}\n       \\caption{SMG fractions (${f}_{\\rm OIRTC}$) for each specified color.

These models are then used to determine the cut that best separate the SMGs from the non-SMG field galaxies in the training sample. Detailed descriptions of the model fits are given in \\autoref{subsec:oir}. \n       \n       }\n    \\label{colormodel}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe SMG fraction ($f_{\\rm OIRTC}$) shown in \\autoref{colorhist} represents the fractional number density in each color bin, and its calculation takes color errors into account, as the uncertainties of $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$ are obtained through Monte Carlo simulations. By describing $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$ with model functions and calibrating the training set with those models, it is possible to determine cuts in a quantitative way. \n\nWe therefore first model $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$ as a function of color by fitting a functional form, parametrized as\n$ 1/(a + e^{-b(x-c)}) $, in which $x$ is the corresponding color. The parametrisation is similar to the Fermi--Dirac distribution, which provides an appropriate description to the distribution of the measured $f_{\\rm OIRTC}$, where the fraction on both sides of the color space converge, \nconnecting by a smooth transition in between. When the colors are very red, the function converges to $1/a$, and to 0 when the colors are very blue. The parameter $b$ describes the sharpness of the transition whereas the parameter $c$ gives the color at which the value equals $1/(a+1)$. The best fit forms of this function are shown in \\autoref{colormodel}, which all fit the distributions well ($\\chi^2 \\lesssim 1$), and we have confirmed that they are not sensitive to the chosen binning. \nThe fitting results are given in \\autoref{fit}\n\nBased on the best-fit parameterised model, we then calculate the weighted-mean SMG fraction, $\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle$, defined as\n\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_i f_{i, \\rm OIRTC}\\times W_i}{\\sum_i W_i} \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\begin{split}\\displaystyle\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle=\\frac{\\sum_{i}f_{i,\\rm&#10;OIRTC%&#10;}\\times W_{i}}{\\sum_{i}W_{i}}\\\\&#10;\\end{split}\" display=\"block\"><mtable displaystyle=\"true\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"right\"><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>OIRTC</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></msub><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>OIRTC</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></msub><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02630.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe best-fit parameters are $A=74.6\\pm4.3$, $B=0.23\\pm0.01$, and $z_\\mu=2.30\\pm0.05$, with a reduced $\\chi^2=1.4$.\n\nIn addition, we observe two peaks in our redshift distribution, one at $z\\sim$\\,1.6, and the other at $z\\sim$\\,2.5 (although considering both the Poisson statistics and uncertainties in the photometric redshifts, a lognormal formalism still provides good fit to the redshift distribution).

In contrast, there is no pre-known large scale structures at $z\\sim$\\,2.5 in UDS.\n\nAs discussed earlier, our redshift distribution is likely to be biased against high-redshift sources, which are essentially too faint to be detected in the NIR survey (\\autoref{subsec:radpoirtc}.2). To illustrate this bias in another way, we measure the weighted average fluxes at 250, 350, 500, and 850\\,$\\mu$m by stacking on the SPIRE and SCUBA-2 maps at the SCUBA-2 source positions. The measurements are made on the SCUBA-2 sources that have candidate SMG counterparts, those that have radio candidate counterparts, and those without any counterpart identification. We plot the results as FIR colors in \\autoref{fircolor}, in which we find that SCUBA-2 sources with radio identifications have the bluest color, followed by those with any kind of identifications, and those without counterpart candidate are the reddest. Following \\citet{Amblard:2010aa} and \\citet{Ivison:2012aa}, we derive expected FIR colors on $10^{6}$ grey-body spectra assuming a single dust temperature, $T_d$, where the flux density $f_\\nu \\propto \\nu^{3+\\beta}/(exp(\\frac{h\\nu}{kT_d})-1)$. To account for the flux uncertainties in the data, each model flux density is randomly deviated by 10\\% assuming Gaussian distribution. We explore the parameter space at $15\\leq T_d\\leq45$, $1\\leq \\beta\\leq2.5$, and $0\\leq z\\leq5$, and the results are plotted in \\autoref{fircolor} in color scale. Clearly, the redder the FIR color, the higher redshift the source is likely to be at. \n\nIn \\autoref{fircolor} we also plot the stacked SEDs along with the best-fit template SEDs based on SMMJ2135-0102 and ALESS SMGs. We find the with either template the best-fit redshift of the SCUBA-2 sources that have candidate counterparts is $z=2.5$, while that of the sources without any candidate counterpart is $z=3.3$, consistent with the higher-$z$ nature on sources without candidate counterpart suggested by the FIR color-color diagram. \n\nThe redder FIR color of the SCUBA-2 sources without counterpart identification supports the idea that these sources are on average at higher redshift compare to those with counterpart candidates. Furthermore, the fact that sources with both radio and OIRTC identifications are slightly redder those that only have radio counterparts also supports the idea stated in the previous sections that OIRTC technique finds candidates at slightly higher redshifts.\n\nTo roughly estimate the median redshift of the complete $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 submillimeter sources, we set the redshifts for that 20\\% (102/523) that do not have any counterpart candidate to $z=3$. We assume a multiple fraction of 40\\% based on the results from \\autoref{subsec:multiplicity}, and we find the median redshift shifting to $z=2.6\\pm0.1$. This result is not sensitive to the assumed multiple fraction.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig14.pdf}\n       \\caption{{\\it Top} and {\\it Middle}: FIR color-color diagram of SCUBA-2 sources stacked on SPIRE/SCUBA-2 maps.

This selection bias is also supported by many observations (e.g., \\citealt{Chapin:2009aa, Smolcic:2012pp, Yun:2012aa, Casey:2013aa, Weis:2013ly, Miettinen:2015aa}). While in some cases the differences could be negligible considering the uncertainties of the measurements, to ensure like-to-like comparisons, we only compare our results to those that are also based on the observations that were carried out at 850/870\\,$\\mu$m. \n\n\\citet{Chapman:2005p5778} (C05) reported a median redshift of $2.2\\pm0.1$ based on a sample of SCUBA-detected, radio-identified, and spectroscopically confirmed SMGs. Our radio-identified counterpart candidates have a median redshift $z=1.9\\pm0.1$, slightly lower but still consistent with that of C05. This is expected as the radio imaging used in C05 is on average slightly deeper than that used in this work, and thus C05 might select SMGs with slightly higher redshifts (\\autoref{subsec:radpoirtc}.2). Indeed, by only considering samples of C05 that are covered by 1.4\\,GHz VLA imaging with a radio depth of $1\\sigma \\geq 10$\\,$\\mu$Jy, the median redshift of C05 sample becomes $z=1.9\\pm0.4$.\n\n\\citet{Simpson:2014aa} reported a median redshift of $z=2.3\\pm0.1$ for 77 ALESS ALMA SMGs that have sufficient optical and NIR photometry to derive reliable photometric redshifts. Our result is in excellent agreement with that of \\citet{Simpson:2014aa}. Furthermore, for the remaining 19 ALESS SMGs that do not have sufficient photometry, \\citet{Simpson:2014aa} argued that these are likely at $z>$\\,3 and by placing them in the high-redshift tail the median redshift is raised to $z=2.5\\pm0.2$, which is again in good agreement with our estimate after accounting for the SCUBA-2 sources that do not have any identified counterpart. \n\nOn the theoretical front, \\citet{Zavala:2014aa} predicted the median redshift to be $z=2.43\\pm0.12$, and \\citet{Cowley:2015aa} showed that for sources with $S_{850} > 1$\\,mJy, which is the flux regime probed by our training sample, the median redshift is $z=2.77\\pm0.11$.These are all again consistent with our results.\n\n\n\\subsection{SMG clustering}\\label{sec:clustering}\nThe significant improvement of the SMG sample size in degree-scale fields provides an unique opportunity to investigate the clustering properties of the SMGs. To study the SMG clustering, we calculate the two-point autocorrelation function $w(\\theta)$ using the Landy \\& Szalay (1993) estimator.\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 79624, "prevtext": "\n\nwhere $i = z-K, K-[3.6], [3.6]-[4.5]$ and $W_i = N_i/\\sigma_i^2$ represents the weight of each color, and $N_i = 148, 161$ and 147, respectively, is the number of available measurements in the training set for each color. Due to the sensitivity and coverage of the imaging, 80\\% (132/164) of the training sample have all three colors measurements (i.e. $\\geq$\\,3\\,$\\sigma$ detections in both bands used in the color), and three field sources have only one or none. Thus the mean SMG fraction is weighted, for each color, by both the model uncertainties and the number of available measurements in the training sample. Because of the nature of this training sample, when applying the OIRTC technique to identify candidate counterparts in the whole SCUBA-2 sample, we only consider sources that have at least two color measurements. \n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{threeparttable}\n\\caption{Best $\\chi^2$ fits on the SMG fraction ($f_{\\rm OIRTC}$)}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\toprule\n Color   &  a  &  b &  c   \\\\\n\\midrule\n         $z-K$  &  1.34$\\pm$0.31   & 2.71$\\pm$0.80   &  2.61$\\pm$0.24     \\\\\n         $K-[3.6]$  &  2.35$\\pm$0.31 & 17.40$\\pm$12.74    &  {1.20}$\\pm$0.08     \\\\\n         $[3.6]-[4.5]$ & 2.65$\\pm$0.34   & 80.0  & 0.28$\\pm$0.02 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n \\begin{tablenotes}\n      \\small\n      \\item Note - All errors are obtained assuming $\\Delta \\chi^2 = 1$ except the b value for \n      $[3.6]-[4.5]$, which is the maximum value we set to prevent numerical overflow in the fitting\n      process.

For each source, based on the parameterised fits shown in \\autoref{colormodel}, $\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle$ is calculated by taking the weighted averaging of all the corresponding values obtained from each measured color. We show both the non-SMG field sources (those not detected by ALMA) as well as the ALMA-detected SMGs. The color points enclosed by a circle are those with radio counterparts (matched within 1$\\farcs$5). The empty black circles are radio-detected SMGs that do not have $K$-band counterparts, and thus we arbitrary set their $\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle$ to $-0.05$. The fact that most radio-detected, $K$-undetected ALMA SMGs have S$_{850} > 6$\\,mJy and all $K$-detected, radio-undetected ALMA SMGs have S$_{850} < 6$\\,mJy highlights the fact that these two ID methods compliment each other in flux space, which is further explored in \\autoref{subsec:radpoirtc}.

Interestingly, although we only used SMGs with $S_{850} \\geq$\\,2.7\\,mJy to derive models of the SMG fraction, the model is equally successful in identifying fainter SMGs, in which 75\\% (6/8) are above the cut. While tentative evidence of bluer colors for SMGs with $S_{850} \\lesssim 1$\\,mJy has been reported by \\citet{Hatsukade:2015aa}, we find that in the S$_{850} {\\mathrel{\\raise0.35ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle >$}\\kern-0.6em \t\t\\lower0.40ex\\hbox{{$\\scriptstyle \\sim$}}}} 1$\\,mJy regime there is no strong color variations among SMGs with different fluxes. Furthermore, those non-SMG comparisons with high $\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle$ could also be faint SMGs with $S_{850} < $\\,2.7\\,mJy that are undetected by ALMA because they are located in the outskirts of the ALMA pointings where the sensitivity is slightly poorer. \n\nIn summary, the OIRTC technique performs slightly better to the triple-color cut in both accuracy and completeness, although subject to the size of the training sample the differences are not statistically significant. We nevertheless adopt the OIRTC technique as the main method for selecting SMGs using optical-infrared colors as it performs the best in the training set. We note that our basic results are not sensitive to the chosen method.\n\n\n\\subsection{Our methodology: Radio+OIRTC identifications}\\label{subsec:radpoirtc}\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\caption{Test results using the ALMA training sample}\n\t\t\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\t\t\t\\toprule\n\t\t\tMethod   &  Accuracy  &  Completeness   \\\\\n\t\t\t\\midrule\n\t\t\tRadio  &  87$^{+13}_{-23}$\\% (26/30)   \t & 52$\\pm$12\\% (27/52)       \\\\\n\t\t\tMIPS  &  78$^{+22}_{-23}$\\% (21/27) \t& 40$\\pm$10\\% (21/52)      \\\\\n\t\t\tOIRTC & 87$^{+13}_{-23}$\\% (27/31)   \t& 52$\\pm$12\\% (27/52)   \\\\\n\t\t\tRadio+OIRTC & 83$^{+17}_{-19}$\\% (35/42)   \t& 67$\\pm$14\\% (35/52)   \\\\\n\t\t\t\\bottomrule\n\t\t\\end{tabular}\n\\label{test}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe test results shown in \\autoref{subsec:radio}, \\autoref{subsec:mips}, and \\autoref{subsec:oir} are summarized in \\autoref{test}, which demonstrate that the accuracy of both radio and OIRTC identification is 87\\%, while the MIPS identification is less accurate, with an additional issue of larger positional uncertainty. In addition, as hinted in \\autoref{score}, the radio and OIRTC selection compliment each other in identifying SMGs in different flux ranges -- at S$_{850} >6$\\,mJy five SMGs can only be identified by radio, while all the SMGs that can be selected by OIRTC technique, but are missed in radio, have S$_{850} < 6$\\,mJy.\n\nIn \\autoref{s850hist} we plot 850\\,$\\mu$m flux distribution of the ALMA SMGs, in which the sub-samples of SMGs identified by different methods are highlighted. Indeed, we find that while the radio sources preferentially identify brighter SMGs, the color analysis picks up fainter ones, and MIPS-identified SMGs have $S_{850}$ in between, as revealed in the median flux of SMGs each method identifies. By combining the radio sources and the OIRTC technique we are able to identify 35 out of 52 ALMA SMGs (67$\\pm$14\\% completeness), with the accuracy of 83$^{+17}_{-19}$\\% (35/42). We emphasize that of all the 52 ALMA-detected SMGs, 14 have no counterpart in any of our ancillary images. In other words, the radio+OIRTC can identify all but three (92\\%; 35/38) ALMA SMGs that are possible to be identified in other wavebands. We also find that all but one of the MIPS-identified SMGs can be selected through either radio or optical-IR color. In addition to the lower positional accuracy of MIPS sources, adding them into the counterpart selection method does not provide better results considering both accuracy and completeness. \n\nAs a result of this analysis, in this study we adopt the radio+OIRTC technique as our major tool to identify the candidate SMG counterparts of SCUBA-2 detected submillimeter sources. Operationally this involves us taking all the radio sources that are matched to the submillimeter sources to within 8$\\farcs$7, supplemented by the radio-undetected, $K$-selected sources identified using the OIRTC technique as candidate SMG counterparts. The chosen search radius of 8$\\farcs$7, based on the theoretical calculations assuming Gaussian distribution ($\\sigma \\sim 0.6({\\rm SNR})^{-1}$FWHM; \\citealt{Ivison:2007fj}), corresponds to a 4\\,$\\sigma$ positional uncertainty for a 4\\,$\\sigma$ SCUBA-2 detection (14$\\farcs$5 FWHM). The search radius of 8$\\farcs$7 also matches to our ALMA primary beam, within which the training set is obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{fig9.pdf}\n       \\caption{Histograms of $S_{850}$ for the 52 ALMA-detected SMGs in the UDS field from \\citet{Simpson:2015ab}.

We find that a given SMG can be identified by several different methods but the combination of radio+OIR finds most of the SMGs (\\autoref{subsec:radpoirtc}).  \n}\n    \\label{s850hist}\n \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Testing our identification methodology}\nWe test our counterpart identification technique on two independent samples that are obtained from ALMA and SMA observations. The first sample of 12 is based on the SMA observations on 9 of our {\\sc main} SCUBA-2 sources (none overlaps with the ALMA targets). The rms noise ranges between $\\sigma = 1-2$\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$, with a synthesized beam $\\sim$2$''$ FWHM (Chapman et al.\\ in prep.). The second test sample is the ALESS {\\sc main} sample with 99 ALMA-detected SMGs, constructed by an ALMA follow-up study at 870\\,$\\mu$m on a flux-limited sample of 126 single-dish submillimeter sources detected on the LABOCA maps in the Extended {\\it Chandra} Deep Field South (ECDFS; \\citealt{Hodge:2013lr}). The ALESS observations have a median rms of $\\sigma \\sim $\\,0.4\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$, with a synthesized beam of $\\sim$1$\\farcs$6 FWHM. \n\nFor the SMA sample, by excluding one source that is associated with a {\\it Class} = 2 SCUBA-2 source (UDS.0010; although that source is accurately predicted by our identification method), we successfully identify 6 out of 11 sources (completeness = $55\\pm28$\\%) with an accuracy of $70^{+30}_{-34}$\\% (7/10). While the SMA sample might be too small, both completeness and accuracy are consistent with our training results.\n\nTo compare to the second test sample, we first take the IRAC-based photometric catalog of sources in ECDF-S from \\citet{Simpson:2014aa}. This includes 13-band photometry from the U-band to 8\\,$\\mu$m and derived photometric redshifts using {\\sc hyperz} \\citep{Bolzonella:2000aa} for $\\sim$\\,45,000 sources in the whole field. We then take those sources lying within the ALMA primary beam centred at the positions of the 88 LESS submillimeter sources from \\citet{Weis:2009qy} for which there are good quality ALMA maps from \\citet{Hodge:2013lr}. This yields a total of 326 sources and we match these to the ALESS main sample to within 1$\\farcs$5 radius. This yields 64 ALESS SMGs with IRAC counterparts and 262 non-SMG sources. We also match to this catalogue the catalogue of 1.4\\,GHz VLA $\\geq $\\,5\\,$\\sigma$ radio sources from \\citet{Biggs:2011uq}. Finally we generate a counterpart candidate catalog based on our radio+OIRTC technique, in which we find an accuracy of {82$\\pm$17\\% (40/49)} and completeness of {40$\\pm$8\\% (40/99)}, which are consistent with the robust identifications based on the $p$-values presented in \\citet{Biggs:2011uq} \\citep{Hodge:2013lr}. \n\nThis test result is very encouraging considering that the OIRTC model is derived based on our $K$-selected training sample in UDS, completely different than the IRAC-selected photometric sample in ECDF-S, yet our empirical method yields matched results to that based on the $p$-values. {Perhaps more importantly, as the ALESS-SMGs have fainter 850\\,$\\mu$m fluxes (median flux of $S_{850}$=2.5\\,mJy versus $S_{850}$=4.2\\,mJy for the ALMA-UDS sample), the equally high success rate for the ALESS sample suggests that the radio properties and/or the OIR colors do not vary significantly as a function of 850\\,$\\mu$m fluxes. This result reassures us that our method does not suffer from a bias owing to the fact that the ALMA training sample is biased toward brighter SCUBA-2 sources.}\n\nA slightly lower completeness on ALESS, on the other hand, is caused by the fact that there are more fainter SMGs, which are more likely to have no detectable counterpart. {The finding of a different completeness in ALESS compare to that of our ALMA training sample also highlights the fact that the depth of the ancillary data affects the completeness of the identifications.}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{What are we missing?}\\label{sec:miss}\n\nBefore we proceed and discuss the scientific implications, it is important to understand what SMGs are missed by our identification process. In \\autoref{kcor} we plot the expected flux densities of an SMG as a function of redshift at 2.2\\,$\\mu$m, 24\\,$\\mu$m,  850\\,$\\mu$m and 20\\,cm. We adopt an SED shape based on the Cosmic Eyelash, a strongly lensed SMG with a typical intrinsic $S_{850}$ similar to that of the SMGs we are probing \\citep{Swinbank:2010p10277}, normalised to a total SFR of 500\\,M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$ (unlensed $S_{850}\\sim3$\\,mJy) assuming a Salpeter IMF. We also plot the results based on the composite rest-frame SED of the ALESS SMGs \\citep{Simpson:2014aa, Swinbank:2014ul}. \n\nFirst of all, as the SEDs are matched to the same $L_{IR}$, it is not surprising that both SEDs have similar 850\\,$\\mu$m and radio fluxes as a function of redshift. However, ALESS SMGs have brighter observed 24\\,$\\mu$m fluxes and bluer color in optical/NIR as shown in a shallower decrease on the observed 2.2\\,$\\mu$m flux. We attribute this effect to the selection bias. As shown in \\citet{Simpson:2014aa} and \\citet{Swinbank:2014ul}, by necessity the composite rest-frame SED of the ALESS SMGs can only be constructed for those sources that have well-constrained photometric redshifts, meaning they are preferentially brighter, especially in the optical/UV. In addition, the comparable detection limits in the optical-IR wavebands in the ECDFS (the location of the ALESS SMGs) biases the detection towards bluer SMGs. \n\n\\autoref{kcor} nicely illustrates that the negative $K$-correction of 850\\,$\\mu$m allows us to detect SMGs in a wide range of the redshift space \\citep{Blain:2002p8120}, while optical-IR and radio suffer from positive $K$-corrections. The main implication is that our methodology of identifying counterpart candidates using radio/OIR imaging is likely to miss the high-redshift SMGs, as seen in \\autoref{kcor} and many other studies in the literature (e.g., \\citealt{Walter:2012qy, Riechers:2013yq}). We are also likely to miss more faint SMGs than the bright ones, providing that the mean redshift of the faint SMGs is similar or higher than that of the bright ones (e.g., \\citealt{Chen:2014aa, Simpson:2014aa}), and the SEDs of the fainter SMGs do not differ significantly compared to the brighter ones. On the other hand, thanks to the deep $K$-band imaging available in UDS, given the same $L_{IR}$ higher-redshift SMGs are more likely to be detected in near-IR than in radio or at 24\\,$\\mu$m. Indeed, in \\autoref{sec:z} we show that our OIRTC technique identifies SMG counterparts that have redshift distributions skewed towards higher-redshifts compared to those with radio counterparts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{fig10.pdf}\n       \\caption{Expected flux densities in mJy as a function of redshift based on the SED of SMMJ2135-0102 (Cosmic Eyelash; \\citealt{Swinbank:2010p10277}) normalised to a total SFR of 500\\,M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.

For the {\\sc main} sample of 716 $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ submillimeter sources, we identify candidate counterparts to 498, from which 129 have two candidate SMG counterparts, 30 have three, and three submillimeter source have four SMG candidate counterparts. Example thumbnails on $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ submillimeter sources with $\\ge$3 counterpart candidate are shown in \\autoref{examplepostage}, and thumbnails for all the 1088 $\\geq3.5\\,\\sigma$ source can be found  in the appendix.\nTherefore we identify counterparts for 70$\\pm$4\\% (498/716) of the {\\sc main} SMG sample, and the fraction of sources having multiple candidate counterparts (multiple fraction) is 33$\\pm$3\\% (163/498).\n\nHowever, because not all the SCUBA-2 sources are covered by both radio and by more than three OIR wavebands needed for the OIRTC technique, each SCUBA-2 source is assigned to one of the three different classes, which are defined based on the following scheme.\n\n1.\t{\\it Class} = 1: within the search radius of $8\\farcs7$ from the SCUBA-2 position, sources that are covered by the radio imaging, and also qualified for the OIRTC technique (having at least two color measurements among $z-K$, $K-[3.6]$, $[3.6]-[4.5]$).\n\n\n2.\t{\\it Class} = 2: sources that are only covered by the radio imaging, but lack the coverage necessary for the OIRTC technique (or only have it in part of the region within the search radius).\n\n\n3.\t{\\it Class} = 3: sources that are not covered by the radio imaging, and not covered by the OIRTC technique either (or only covered in part of the region within the search radius).\n\nFor the 716 {\\sc main} SCUBA-2 sources, 523 are $Class=1$, 191 are {\\it Class} = 2 and 2 are {\\it Class} = 3, respectively, and their spatial distribution is shown in \\autoref{multicover}. For {\\it Class} = 1 sources we identify candidate counterparts to 421, from which 124 have two candidate SMG counterparts, 28 have three, and three submillimeter source have four SMG candidate counterparts. \nTherefore for $Class =1$ {\\sc main} sample we find an overall identification rate of 80$\\pm$5\\% (421/523) and a multiple fraction of 37$\\pm$3\\% (155/421). The numbers are much lower for {\\it Class} = 2 {\\sc main} sample, with an ID rate of $40\\pm5$\\% (77/191) and a multiple fraction of $9\\pm4$\\% (7/77). By construction there would be no ID for {\\it Class} = 3 sources.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.84]{fig11.pdf}\n       \\caption{False-color [3.6]-$K$-$z$ (r-g-b) thumbnails of example $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 submillimeter sources with three or four candidate SMG counterparts.

Therefore for the {\\it Class} = 1 sources, based on the training sample we expect the identification accuracy to be 82$\\pm$20\\% (31/38), and the completeness to be 69$\\pm$16\\% (31/45), while for the {\\it Class} = 2 sources where only radio coverage is available, based on \\autoref{subsec:radio} we expect an identification accuracy of 87$^{+13}_{-23}$ and a completeness of 52$\\pm$12\\%. However, because the training sample was selected from the typically brighter ($S_{850} > 8$\\,mJy) sources, the ALMA follow-up observations on the whole SCUBA-2 SMGs are likely to produce more fainter SMGs with $S_{850} < $\\,4\\,mJy than those in the training sample. We therefore expect the overall completeness to be less than the numbers quoted above. \n\n{To estimate the true completeness with our method on SMGs with $S_{850} > 1$\\,mJy that are located within the beam area of the SCUBA-2 sources, we assume that we have ALMA follow-up observations for the rest of the SCUBA-2 sample, and we model the results by assuming for each SCUBA-2 source a 40\\% chance that it breaks into two sub-components (see \\autoref{subsec:multiplicity} regarding the multiple fraction for the SCUBA-2 sources). We then assume that for those broken into sub-components, the flux contribution is 75\\% and 25\\% of the SCUBA-2 flux, respectively, based on \\citet{Simpson:2015ab}. We then apply the identification rate based on \\autoref{s850hist} to the model flux distribution, and compute the completeness by dividing the expected number of identifications to the total number of the model SMGs.

The slightly lower fractions in identification rate (64$\\pm$6\\%) and multiple fraction (23$\\pm$4\\%) in the tentative sample could be due to the expected higher spurious rate ($\\sim$\\,10\\%). The full identifications are given in \\autoref{tab:ids}.\n\nWe stress that our counterpart identification method is trained based on the ALMA follow-up observations on part of our sample SCUBA-2 SMGs in UDS, and aims to provide all counterpart candidates with $S_{850} > 1$\\,mJy.\n\n\n\\subsection{Identification rate and multiple fraction}\\label{subsec:multiplicity}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{fig12.pdf}\n       \\caption{{\\it Top}: The fraction of SCUBA-2 sources that have at least one candidate SMG counterpart (identification rate) in percentage as a function of measured $S_{850}$ for the submillimeter sources in the SCUBA-2 map.

First tentative evidence for multiplicity came from radio-identified counterparts (e.g., \\citealt{Ivison:2002uq}). Subsequently the true confirmation with submillimeter interferometry came from \\citet{Wang:2011p9293} and many other studies \\citep{Barger:2012lr, Barger:2014aa, Hodge:2013lr, Simpson:2015ab, Bussmann:2015aa}. However, these studies differ in the multiple fraction, which ranges from 10--70\\% depending on the depth of the follow-up observations \\citep{Chen:2013gq}. The most recent ALMA results suggest moderate multiplicity, $\\sim$\\,60\\% for submillimeter sources with $S_{850}\\sim$\\,8\\,mJy, with the primary source contributing on average $\\sim$\\,75\\% of the the total flux from the single-dish source \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}.  \n\nIn \\autoref{idrate} we also show our results on the multiple fraction to the $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 sample. We find a constant multiple fraction of $\\sim$\\,40\\% as a function of 850\\,$\\mu$m flux, with a positive (but not significant) slope. While the ALMA imaging reveals multiple fractions in broad agreement with ours, a noticeable but not significant increase (decrease) can be seen in the brightest (faintest) bin, making a correlation between multiple fraction and 850\\,$\\mu$m flux from SCUBA-2 slightly more significant. This can be explained by the fact that, in the multiple systems revealed by the ALMA imaging, many of the fainter companions have $S_{850} < $\\,3\\,mJy, making them unlikely to be identified through our method, or any other multiwavelength identification methods as they are usually undetected at almost all other wavelengths. On the other hand, a slightly lower multiple fraction in the faintest bin can be explained by the sensitivity of the ALMA imaging. The median sensitivity of the ALMA observations is 0.26\\,mJy beam$^{-1}$, providing a 4\\,$\\sigma$ detection limit of $\\sim$1\\,mJy in the central region, and 2\\,mJy within the primary beam. Assuming that the secondary sources contribute to 25\\% of the total SCUBA-2 flux \\citep{Simpson:2015ab}, the ALMA observations can detect the secondary SMGs for SCUBA-2 sources with $S_{850} > $\\,8\\,mJy. For SCUBA-2 sources fainter than $S_{850} < $\\,8\\,mJy, the ALMA observations are not sensitive enough to detect the secondary sources if located close to the edge of the primary beam, biasing the fraction towards a lower multiple value. We conclude that, for follow-up observations that are sensitive to $S_{850} \\sim$1\\,mJy across the whole ALMA beam area, the true multiple fraction for single-dish submillimeter sources with 850\\,$\\mu$m fluxes of $S_{850} {\\mathrel{\\raise0.35ex\\hbox{$\\scriptstyle >$}\\kern-0.6em \t\t\\lower0.40ex\\hbox{{$\\scriptstyle \\sim$}}}} $\\,4\\,mJy is likely to be higher than 40\\%.\n\n\n\\subsection{Redshift distribution}\\label{sec:z}\n\n\n\nIn \\autoref{zhist} we plot the redshift distribution of the counterpart candidates of the $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 sources, in which we also show the distribution of those that have radio counterparts, ALESS \\citep{Simpson:2014aa}, and our ALMA pilot study in UDS (Simpson et al.\\ in preparation). \n\nThe median redshift of the counterpart candidates of our $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 SMGs is $z=2.3\\pm0.1$, and that based on the radio identifications is $z=1.9\\pm0.1$. The median redshift of the ALMA-UDS sample is slightly higher at $z=2.7\\pm0.2$. The difference is not significant but this could suggest a dependency between 850\\,$\\mu$m flux and redshift, since the ALMA-UDS sample is much brighter. By conducting photometric redshift analysis on ALESS SMGs, \\citet{Simpson:2014aa} found a weak trend between 870\\,$\\mu$m flux and redshift. However, after accounting for the selection bias Simpson et al. conclude that the median redshift is likely not dependent on the 870\\,$\\mu$m flux. A weak positive or non-existing trend is in contrast with recent predictions by \\citet{Cowley:2015aa}, who based on their semi-analytic model predict a negative trend between 850\\,$\\mu$m flux and redshift. \n\nTo obtain errors of the redshift distribution, we perform Monte Carlo simulations based on both the Poisson statistics and uncertainties in the photometric redshifts.

In contrast, there is no pre-known large scale structures at $z\\sim$\\,2.5 in UDS.\n\nAs discussed earlier, our redshift distribution is likely to be biased against high-redshift sources, which are essentially too faint to be detected in the NIR survey (\\autoref{subsec:radpoirtc}.2). To illustrate this bias in another way, we measure the weighted average fluxes at 250, 350, 500, and 850\\,$\\mu$m by stacking on the SPIRE and SCUBA-2 maps at the SCUBA-2 source positions. The measurements are made on the SCUBA-2 sources that have candidate SMG counterparts, those that have radio candidate counterparts, and those without any counterpart identification. We plot the results as FIR colors in \\autoref{fircolor}, in which we find that SCUBA-2 sources with radio identifications have the bluest color, followed by those with any kind of identifications, and those without counterpart candidate are the reddest. Following \\citet{Amblard:2010aa} and \\citet{Ivison:2012aa}, we derive expected FIR colors on $10^{6}$ grey-body spectra assuming a single dust temperature, $T_d$, where the flux density $f_\\nu \\propto \\nu^{3+\\beta}/(exp(\\frac{h\\nu}{kT_d})-1)$. To account for the flux uncertainties in the data, each model flux density is randomly deviated by 10\\% assuming Gaussian distribution. We explore the parameter space at $15\\leq T_d\\leq45$, $1\\leq \\beta\\leq2.5$, and $0\\leq z\\leq5$, and the results are plotted in \\autoref{fircolor} in color scale. Clearly, the redder the FIR color, the higher redshift the source is likely to be at. \n\nIn \\autoref{fircolor} we also plot the stacked SEDs along with the best-fit template SEDs based on SMMJ2135-0102 and ALESS SMGs. We find the with either template the best-fit redshift of the SCUBA-2 sources that have candidate counterparts is $z=2.5$, while that of the sources without any candidate counterpart is $z=3.3$, consistent with the higher-$z$ nature on sources without candidate counterpart suggested by the FIR color-color diagram. \n\nThe redder FIR color of the SCUBA-2 sources without counterpart identification supports the idea that these sources are on average at higher redshift compare to those with counterpart candidates. Furthermore, the fact that sources with both radio and OIRTC identifications are slightly redder those that only have radio counterparts also supports the idea stated in the previous sections that OIRTC technique finds candidates at slightly higher redshifts.\n\nTo roughly estimate the median redshift of the complete $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 submillimeter sources, we set the redshifts for that 20\\% (102/523) that do not have any counterpart candidate to $z=3$.

This selection bias is also supported by many observations (e.g., \\citealt{Chapin:2009aa, Smolcic:2012pp, Yun:2012aa, Casey:2013aa, Weis:2013ly, Miettinen:2015aa}). While in some cases the differences could be negligible considering the uncertainties of the measurements, to ensure like-to-like comparisons, we only compare our results to those that are also based on the observations that were carried out at 850/870\\,$\\mu$m. \n\n\\citet{Chapman:2005p5778} (C05) reported a median redshift of $2.2\\pm0.1$ based on a sample of SCUBA-detected, radio-identified, and spectroscopically confirmed SMGs. Our radio-identified counterpart candidates have a median redshift $z=1.9\\pm0.1$, slightly lower but still consistent with that of C05. This is expected as the radio imaging used in C05 is on average slightly deeper than that used in this work, and thus C05 might select SMGs with slightly higher redshifts (\\autoref{subsec:radpoirtc}.2). Indeed, by only considering samples of C05 that are covered by 1.4\\,GHz VLA imaging with a radio depth of $1\\sigma \\geq 10$\\,$\\mu$Jy, the median redshift of C05 sample becomes $z=1.9\\pm0.4$.\n\n\\citet{Simpson:2014aa} reported a median redshift of $z=2.3\\pm0.1$ for 77 ALESS ALMA SMGs that have sufficient optical and NIR photometry to derive reliable photometric redshifts. Our result is in excellent agreement with that of \\citet{Simpson:2014aa}. Furthermore, for the remaining 19 ALESS SMGs that do not have sufficient photometry, \\citet{Simpson:2014aa} argued that these are likely at $z>$\\,3 and by placing them in the high-redshift tail the median redshift is raised to $z=2.5\\pm0.2$, which is again in good agreement with our estimate after accounting for the SCUBA-2 sources that do not have any identified counterpart. \n\nOn the theoretical front, \\citet{Zavala:2014aa} predicted the median redshift to be $z=2.43\\pm0.12$, and \\citet{Cowley:2015aa} showed that for sources with $S_{850} > 1$\\,mJy, which is the flux regime probed by our training sample, the median redshift is $z=2.77\\pm0.11$.These are all again consistent with our results.\n\n\n\\subsection{SMG clustering}\\label{sec:clustering}\nThe significant improvement of the SMG sample size in degree-scale fields provides an unique opportunity to investigate the clustering properties of the SMGs.

The systematic uncertainties are then estimated through the variance of these $w(\\theta)_{true,jk}$ fits.\nFinally, the error of the amplitude $A$ for $w(\\theta)_{true}$ is computed by accounting for the shot noise, Poission errors, and the systematic uncertainties estimated based on the jackknife resampling. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n    \\leavevmode\n      \\includegraphics[scale=0.88]{fig15.pdf}\n       \\caption{The angular autocorrelation function of $1<z<3$ SMGs ({\\it black circles} and {\\it grey squares}),\n       all corrected for the integral constraint.

While we use the probability distribution of redshifts, $p(z)$, of the candidate SMGs, we use the positions of the SCUBA-2 sources, not the positions of the candidate SMGs. This is because while the SCUBA-2 sources are selected uniformly with $S_{850}\\gtrsim 3$\\,mJy, the candidate SMGs might have fluxes down to $S_{850}\\sim$1\\,mJy as they are based on a training set from the deeper ALMA imaging. By using all candidate SMGs, we are effectively creating a sample which is subject to uneven flux selections within and outside the beam, potentially resulting in an artificial boost in $w(\\theta)$ on small scale (\\autoref{wtheta}). This is not to say that the clustering of SMGs is sensitive to 850\\,$\\mu$m flux, in fact as we show in \\autoref{wtheta} the results at $>0\\farcm3$ (greater than the size of the beam) are not sensitive to the adopted positions. At this scale the clustering is determined by the original SCUBA-2 catalog. \n\nOur clustering measurement is a factor of four higher, though still within uncertainties, than the theoretical predictions for the submillimeter single-dish surveys recently proposed by \\citet{Cowley:2015ab}. Our results are also higher, but still within uncertainties, than the measurements reported previously \\citep{Webb:2003p6591, Blain:2004aa, Weis:2009qy, Williams:2011aa, Hickox:2012kk}.\n\nBased on the dark matter (DM) power spectrum provided by the {\\sc halofit} code of \\citet{Smith:2003aa}, our $w(\\theta)$ measurements suggest a galaxy bias of $b = 9.1^{+2.1}_{-2.8}$ and an autocorrelation length of $r_0 = 21^{+6}_{-7} h^{-1}$Mpc, which corresponds to a DM halo mass of $M_{halo} = 8\\pm5 \\times10^{13} h^{-1} M_\\odot$.  While most results report SMG DM halo mass of $M_{halo} \\sim 10^{13} h^{-1} M_\\odot$, it is apparent that the measurements of SMG clustering are still suffer from large uncertainties. Larger samples with better determinations of their redshifts, or cross-correlation with other populations with larger sample size (Wilkinson et al. in prep.), are needed to provide better constraints to the SMG clustering properties. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\nWe present the results of the identification of counterparts to 1088 submillimeter sources that are detected at $\\geq3.5\\,\\sigma$ in our SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey imaging of the UKIDSS-UDS field. We analyse a subset of 716 $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$  SCUBA-2 sources, expected to have high fidelity with $\\sim1$\\% false detection rate. The SCUBA-2 sources are categorised into three classes, based on their multi-wavelength coverage, with the {\\it Class} = 1 sources having the best coverage for the counterpart search. The analyses of this paper is built upon an ALMA pilot study on a subset of 30 brighter SCUBA-2 sources \\citep{Simpson:2015ab,Simpson:2015aa}, as well as lessons learnt from the ALESS ALMA survey of submililmeter sources in the ECDFS \\citep{Hodge:2013lr}, and the results are summarized as following: \n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Based on ALMA observations of a subset of SCUBA-2 sources, we investigate the accuracy and the completeness of the $p$-values that has been widely applied in the literature to find radio/MIPS counterparts for the submillimeter sources. We find that at the depth of our ALMA imaging (central $1\\,\\sigma\\sim0.25$\\,mJy beam$^{-1}$), the accuracy of both radio and MIPS identifications is not dependant on the $p$-value for $p < 0.1$, {although MIPS has a poorer spatial resolution, leading to more blending}. We find that including all the radio and MIPS sources that are located within the ALMA primary beam produces better identification results, in terms of maximising the product of accuracy and completeness, compare to the traditional method of only considering the $p<0.05$ sources. By doing so we find the accuracy and the completeness of the radio (MIPS) identification to be $87^{+13}_{-23}$\\% ($78^{+22}_{-23}$)\\% and $52\\pm12$\\% ($40\\pm10$\\%).\n \n\\item Using our 52 ALMA-detected SMGs in the UDS as a training set, we develop a novel technique for counterpart identification, OIRTC, by utilising three optical and NIR colors ($z-K$, $K-[3.6]$, and $[3.6]-[4.5]$). For sources above the mean SMG fraction cut $\\langle f_{\\rm OIRTC}\\rangle > 0.05$, the OIRTC technique provides accuracy and completeness almost identical to the radio identification, $87\\pm23$\\%, and $52\\pm12$\\%, respectively. Most importantly, the OIRTC technique complements the radio identifications in selecting SCUBA-2 sources, in a sense that OIRTC selects fainter sources. In addition, the OIRTC technique recovers almost all MIPS identifications. Based on these results, we adopt both radio imaging and the OIRTC technique (radio+OIRTC) to select counterpart candidates in this work. \n\n\\item In the two OIR colors that are used to train the OIRTC technique, $z-K$ and $K-[3.6]$, we find in the $S_{850} \\gtrsim1$\\,mJy regime that there is no strong color variations among SMGs with different 850\\,$\\mu$m fluxes. In $[3.6]-[4.5]$ color, however, we find that the fainter SMGs with $S_{850} < 2.7$\\,mJy have a median color bluer than that of the brighter SMGs ($S_{850} > 2.7$\\,mJy). \n\n\\item For the 523 $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 sources that have both radio and OIRTC coverage, we find at least one candidate counterpart for $80\\pm5$\\% of the sample, and $37\\pm3$\\% have more than one candidate counterpart. Based on the training sample, the identifications of this sample is accurate to $82\\pm20$\\%, with a completeness of $69\\pm16$\\%, although the completeness may be lower ($\\sim$60\\%) due to the fact that the training sample is based on bright SCUBA-2 sources. {The fact that our identification method still yields moderate incompleteness highlights the importance of conducting follow-up interferometric observations to provide completely reliable sample of SMGs \\citep{{Hodge:2013lr}}.} We find that the identification rate is lower for fainter SCUBA-2 sources, and argue that for follow-up observations sensitive to SMGs with $S_{850}\\sim1$\\,mJy across the whole ALMA beam, the multiple fraction is likely to be $\\gtrsim40$\\% for sources with $S_{850} \\gtrsim 4$\\,mJy.\n\n\\item The redshift distribution based on the {photometric redshifts of the} candidate SMG counterparts of the $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 sources is well fit by a log-normal distribution, with a median redshift of $z=2.3\\pm0.1$ (as found by \\citet{Simpson:2014aa}). Based on the selection curves and the FIR colors, we argue that submillimeter sources without any identification are likely to be located at $z \\gtrsim 3$. After accounting for these unidentified sources, we estimate that the median redshift for SMGs with $S_{850} > 1$\\,mJy to be $z=2.6\\pm0.1$. Our results are in good agreement with model predictions and previous observational measurements.  \n\n\\item Using the Landy \\& Szalay estimator we find a strong angular clustering signal, although still with large uncertainties, for candidate SMGs associated with $\\geq4\\,\\sigma$ {\\it Class} = 1 SCUBA-2 sources at $1<z<3$. The clustering signal roughly corresponds to a correlation length of $r_0 = 21^{+6}_{-7} h^{-1}$Mpc, or galaxy bias of $b = 9.1^{+2.1}_{-2.8}$, and a DM halo mass of $M_{halo} = 8\\pm5 \\times10^{13} h^{-1} M_\\odot$. Our results highlight the fact that larger samples of SMGs with better determinations on redshifts, or cross-correlation with other populations with larger sample size, are needed to provide better constraints on the SMG clustering properties, and so test the relationship of this population to local galaxies.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n{We thank the referee for a helpful report that has improved the manuscript.}\nWe would like to thank Peder Norberg for helpful discussions on the clustering measurement.
