This phenomenon is usually described in terms of a relatively large slip length, which is in turn defined by such microscopic properties as the friction between water and capillary surfaces, and the viscosity of water. We show that the viscosity of water and, therefore, its flow rate are profoundly affected by the layered structure of confined water if the capillary size becomes less than 2 nm. To this end we study the structure and dynamics of water confined between two parallel graphene layers using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the shear viscosity is not only greatly enhanced for subnanometer capillaries, but also exhibits large oscillations that originate from commensurability between the capillary size and the size of water molecules. Such oscillating behavior of viscosity and, consequently, the slip length should be taken into account in designing and studying graphene-based and similar membranes for desalination and filtration.\n\n\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\nWater confined in a nanoscale channel exhibits very different properties compared to bulk water and its behavior depends strongly on the channel size and the affinity between water and a material of the confining walls~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS,science2006,maja,pnas,33,4,Kotsalis,nature2001}. Experimentally, large enhancement of the water flow rate was found for carbon nanotubes (CNT) with diameters less than a few nm~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS,science2006,maja} and, more recently, superpermeation of water through nanochannels within graphene membranes was reported~\\cite{Nair}. The measured water flow in subnanometer CNTs can be several orders of magnitude higher than the values calculated from continuum hydrodynamic models~\\cite{science2006}, which offers a possibility of developing new nanofluidics devices~\\cite{pnas,33,4}.\n\nNumerous studies based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations  identified key factors that affect the behavior of water on the nanoscale~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS2012,NanoLett,prl2003,jchem2003,mario,ACSnano}: (i) the breakdown of the uniform fluid density (layered structure of nanoconfined water); (ii) the water-solid wall slip length much larger than capillary sizes, which effectively results in  different boundary conditions compared to bulk water in macroscopic channels, and (iii) the effective shear viscosity that is different from the bulk value.\n\nIn terms of the structure of water, there is consensus that nanoconfined water can form distinct ice-like layers at room temperature, including monolayer- and bilayer ice; different amorphous/ordered ice structures were found in a large number of MD studies. For example, monolayer ice was proposed by Zangi and Mark~\\cite{prl2003} using MD simulations with a five site and tetrahedrally coordinated model (TIP5P). They confined water between two parallel plates, applied a high lateral pressure ($P_l$) up to 2 kbar and found a non-flat monolayer of ice. Formation of a monolayer ice was also proposed as the reason for the superpermeation of water through graphene nanochannels~\\cite{Nair,nat2015}.\n\n\nUnlike the static structure,   dynamics of water on nanoscale remains highly controversial, with widely varying and conflicting results (see Ref.~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS} for a recent review). This is likely because boundary conditions are difficult to control, and measuring of the water flow close to a surface is difficult even in numerical simulations. The reported values of the slip length ($L_s$) for hydrophobic surfaces - a crucial parameter for determining water flow - vary by several orders of magnitude~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS}. For example, using nonequilibrium MD simulations Kotsalis \\emph{et al.}~\\cite{Kotsalis} found $L_s$ for water flow in a 2.71\\,nm diameter CNT  to be 11\\,nm, while Ming D. Ma  \\emph{et al.}~\\cite{SHEN}, reported the slip length of about 200-1100 nm using the same method and a nanotube of the same dimensions. It was also reported that $L_s$ is sensitive to the external field (a constant force applied to all atoms within water molecules in order to force the flow of water through CNTs)~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS,NanoLett,JCHEMPHYS2012}. The situation is rather similar for a flat graphene, in which case $L_s$  is found to be scattered in the range 1 to 80 nm~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS,NanoLett}.\n\nIn its turn, the slip length is a function of both the friction coefficient ($\\xi$) and the viscosity of confined water ($\\eta$) so that $L_s = \\eta/ \\xi$~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS,JCHEMPHYS2012}. The low-friction behavior of water inside hydrophobic capillaries is well understood as it is entropically unfavorable for a hydrophobic surface to bind to water molecules via ionic or hydrogen bonds, i.e.,  $\\xi\\propto\\rho h$, where $\\rho$ is the water density and $h$ is the distance between the two surfaces~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS}.\n\n Furthermore, the friction is affected by the surface curvature ~\\cite{NanoLett2010} and depends on the atomic structure of the confining walls, e.g. $\\xi$ for water on an ionic surface (hBN) is found to be three times larger than on graphene~\\cite{NAnoLett2014}.\n\nIn contrast, the shear viscosity of nanoconfined water is understood poorly, especially for channels narrower than a few nm~\\cite{chemRev}. Most of the experiments measured the viscosity of a liquid (e.g. water) between mica surfaces~\\cite{jnc,klein1998,1978,raviv}. Raviv \\emph{et al.}~\\cite{raviv} found that the effective viscosity of water remains within a factor of three of its bulk value when confined to films with thickness between 0.4 and 3.5\\,nm,~while Dhinojwala~\\emph{et al.}~\\cite{Garcil} found the viscosity under confinement orders of magnitude larger than in the bulk. On the other hand, MD simulations found monotonically decreasing (vanishing) viscosity of water inside CNTs as the CNT diameter falls below 1.5 nm~\\cite{nanscale,Babu}.\n\nOne of possible reasons for the contradicting results is the fact that the existing studies do not take into account that the viscosity of liquids near solid surfaces is spatially varying which should affect the effective viscosity of water in a nanochannel and, as a result, will affect the slip length and the flow rate. Yet, in the simulations, the channel size is often varied in  $\\sim$1 nm steps. Therefore the effect of sub-Angstrom changes in the channel size on the viscosity and slip length, while probably important, remains unknown.\n\nHere, by using the reactive force field (ReaxFF) potential~\\cite{reax} and employing equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect of the channel size on the structure and shear viscosity of water confined between two graphene layers. We show that sub-Angstrom variations in the channel size change the shear viscosity of water in an unexpected way. In particular, we find that the shear viscosity oscillates as a function of the distance between the confining walls, which originates from the interplay between the molecular size of water, hydrophobicity of the walls, and the complex arrangement of hydrogen bonds.  Such oscillations should have a profound effect on the slip length and the flow rate and should be taken into account in studies of water transport through nanochannels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Method and model}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two widely used molecular dynamics methods in water transport simulations: nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) and equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations using classical force fields, e.g. TIP4P and SPC/E models~\\cite{prl2003,jchem2003}.

Shear viscosity of bulk water}\n\n\n\nIn order to check the validity of the ReaxFF potential for the simulation of the\nviscosity of water, we first performed  extensive simulations for N=5488 water molecules in a box with  dimensions $88\\times\n88\\times42.5$\\AA$^3$ which corresponds to the density of water at room\ntemperature, $\\simeq$1 $gcm^{-3}$. We applied periodic boundary\nconditions in the three directions and kept the temperature fixed at 298\\,K\nusing Nose-Hoover thermostat. After reaching the equilibrium state, we\ncalculate the shear viscosity using Eq.~(2). The viscosity is found to be\n(4.731$\\pm0.003)\\times10^{-4}$ Pa\\,s which is in agreement with\nthe results obtained from other force fields, e.g. TIP4P yields\n(4.83$\\pm$0.09)$\\times 10^{-4}$ Pa s~\\cite{jpcm}. The experimental viscosity for bulk water is\n$\\simeq$6.0$\\times10^{-4}$\\,Pa s~\\cite{viscexp} at room temperature. The difference between experiment and MD results is likely due to the relatively small unit cell in our  MD simulations.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{B. Shear viscosity  of nanoconfined water}\n\nNext we confine water between two graphene layers while keeping the density of water molecules fixed at $1g/cm^{3}$.\nThe density is given by $\\rho=\\frac{18N}{A N_a(h-t)}$gcm$^{-3}$ for a fixed area $A=43\\times37.5\\AA^2$ (here $N_a$ is Avogadro's constant).~Accordingly, we change the distance between the graphene layers from $h$=7.5\\AA~ to  $h$=20\\AA.~We\nnote that, when estimating the volume of water, one needs to exclude the\nvolume taken up by the graphene layers by using $h-t$ instead of $h$. In our calculations we used $t\\sim 1$\\AA~as an approximation for the atomic diameter of carbon atoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig5}, we show the variation of the shear viscosity with $h$ at room\ntemperature. It is seen that the shear viscosity is much higher than for bulk water either at ambient or elevated pressures~\\cite{viscexp}- see the horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 1. The highest viscosity is found for $h$=7.5\\AA.~As $h$ increases, the  viscosity first decays fast and then starts oscillating as a function of $h$. We have found four minima located at $h$=9, 11.5, 15 and 18\\AA~and four maxima located at $h$=7.5,~10,~13.5, and 16.5\\AA.\n\n~In order to interpret the obtained\nresults, we divide Fig. 1 into five segments shown by different colors and will analyze the structure of\nwater at each minimum and maximum.\n\n\n\\textbf{C.

In Fig. 2, we show four snapshots of\nthe cross-sectional view of the structure of\nconfined water corresponding to the maxima (a) and\nminima (b) of the shear viscosity. To further\ncharacterize the degree of ordering into layered\nstructures, Figs. 3(a) and (b) show the corresponding\nradial distribution function (RDF) for\nthe O-O distances (for all water molecules) for the\nchannel sizes corresponding to maxima and minima in\nshear viscosity, respectively. Furthermore the\ncorresponding density profiles along the\nperpendicular direction are shown in Fig.~4.\n\n\n\\textbf{\\emph{C. I. Maxima of the shear viscosity}}.\n\n\n\n\nFor the narrowest channel (i.e. $h$=7.5\\AA,~ the first maximum in the viscosity)\na typical snapshot of the water structure is shown in\nFig. 2(a) (top panel).  Notice that two\ndistinct layers of water are formed between the graphene\nwalls, although no ordering was found in the\narrangement of water molecules within the layers.\nFurthermore, the layered structure is very stable: there is no exchange of water molecules between the two layers. The corresponding\nRDF (circles in Fig. 3(a)) has two clear peaks at 2.84 and\n5.4\\AA.~ The first peak corresponds to the nearest\nneighbor average O-O distance and the second peak\nindicates a long range order in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~For the 10\\,\\AA~channel, the first and second peaks in Fig. 3(a) are at 2.84\\,\\AA~ and 5.7\\,\\AA,~ respectively.\n Note that the second peaks for $h$=7.5\\,\\AA~ and 10\\,\\AA~are closer to each other both in height and position than to the (less pronounced) peaks for $h$=15\\,\\AA~ and 16.5\\,\\AA.~Furthermore, the  RDF values for these $h$ are notably larger than the corresponding RDF for $h$=13.5\\AA~ and\n  16.5\\AA.~This indicates a similar long range order for $h$=7.5\\,\\AA~ and 10\\,\\AA,~ with next-nearest neighbor O-O distance of 5.5\\AA~while\n   the distinctiveness of the water layers and the long range order are gradually lost for wider\nchannels.\n\n~In Fig.~4(a), we show the density profile of\n  the water molecules for the channels with $h$=7.5\\,\\AA~ and 10\\,\\AA.~There are three water layers in the $h$=10\\,\\AA~channel, each layer corresponding to a peak in the density profile in Fig.~4(a).  Importantly, while for $h$=7.5\\AA~there is no exchange of water molecules between the layers (the structure is solid-like, i.e. corresponds to ice),  for $h$=10\\AA,~ a `virtual' layer forms with lower density than the `main layers' adjacent to the graphene walls. The water molecules in this virtual layer are in  constant exchange with the main layers.

As seen form Fig. 4(b), for these wider channels\n    there are four (five) distinguishable  water layers with two denser, well-defined layers adjacent to the graphene walls and more diffuse intermediate layers with almost uniform distribution of water molecules, especially for $h=$16.5\\AA.~\n\\begin{table*}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n $h$(\\AA)     & $d$(\\AA)& $\\delta$(\\AA)     \\\\\n\\hline\n$7.5$          &  2.4$\\pm$0.1 & 2.5$\\pm$0.1      \\\\\n$10$           & 2.4$\\pm$0.1 & 2.6$\\pm$0.1    \\\\\n\n\n\\hline\\hline\n$9$       &     3.6$\\pm$0.2 & 2.7$\\pm$0.2 \\\\\n$11.5$         &  3.0$\\pm$0.2& 2.7$\\pm$0.3   \\\\\n\n\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\par\n\\caption {The  distance between water layers, i.e. $d$, and the distance between the two main water layers and\nthe graphene walls, i.e. $\\delta$.}\n\\label{Table:HystV}\n\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\textbf{\\emph{C. II. Minima of the shear viscosity}}.\n\nWater molecules in the channel with $h$=9\\,\\AA ~form two layers adjacent to the\ngraphene walls (main layers), somewhat similar to the\n$h$=7.5\\AA~ channel where the highest viscosity is observed.\nHowever, in this case, there are also many water molecules\nbetween the two layers that effectively connect the main\nlayers with each other (see Figs. 2(b) and 4(c)). For the\n$h$=11.5\\AA~ channel such water molecules clearly form a\nmiddle layer. However, this middle layer is not\nstable: its water molecules constantly hop between the top\nand bottom layers (main layers). This movement of water between the layers can be seen in provided Supplementary Movies~\\cite{supp}. We note that the number of water layers formed in the\ngraphene channel for $h$=9\\AA~ and $h$=11.5\\AA~ is in agreement\nwith the MD results~\\cite{nat2015}.\n\n For $h$=15\nand 18\\AA~ channels the middle layers become almost\nindistinct (see density profiles in Fig. 4(d)), again with water\nmolecules in intermediate layers constantly hopping and\nconnecting the two main layers adjacent to the graphene\nwalls. It is this hopping of water molecules between the main\nlayers that plays an essential role in decreasing the shear\nviscosity.\n\nIn fact, at the minima the viscosity of confined water becomes\nof the same order as for bulk water at ambient pressure~\\cite{viscexp} (the latter is shown In Fig. 1). This is\nconsistent with the absence of a stable layered structure due\nto the constant exchange of water molecules between the\nlayers (20$\\%$ of water molecules hop between the main layers).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to compare the dynamic properties of water corresponding to, for example, the first maximum and the first minimum of the shear viscosity, we performed two long time simulations for $h$=7.5\\AA~and $h$=9\\AA.~The results for a time series of the variation of z-component of the center of mass of confined water molecules\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 10890, "prevtext": "\n The results from the NEMD simulations are very sensitive to the applied field as well as to averaging processes and may cause some unexpected errors~\\cite{JCHEMPHYS}.

Distinct layering of water confined between the graphene layers is apparent only for particular channel sizes.\nWe also find that i) independent of $h$,  two\n  `main layers' of water are always formed, adjacent to the graphene walls (which also have the largest number of water molecules as compared to the intermediate layers), ii) as $h$  increases beyond 15-16\\AA,~the middle layers become mixed, and  we\nobtain almost bulk water between the two  main water layers, and iii) the first peak in the O-O distance, corresponding to the nearest layer separation\noccurs around 2.84\\AA,~ almost independent of $h$, while the location of the second peak (next-nearest layer separation) depends on $h$.\n\n\n\nFrom our analysis, it is clear that\nthe shear viscosity of confined water is related to the commensurability\nbetween the size of the channel and the space\nrequired to accommodate one layer of water molecules. For $h$\nvalues corresponding to low shear viscosity (of the same\norder as the shear viscosity of bulk water), e.g. for $h$=9\nand 11.5\\AA,~ confined water is commensurate with the\nchannel size $h$. The latter results in minima in the shear viscosity. For $h$ values corresponding to the\nlarger shear viscosity, confined water is incommensurate\nwith $h$, resulting in maxima of the shear viscosity.

Shear viscosity of bulk water}\n\n\n\nIn order to check the validity of the ReaxFF potential for the simulation of the\nviscosity of water, we first performed  extensive simulations for N=5488 water molecules in a box with  dimensions $88\\times\n88\\times42.5$\\AA$^3$ which corresponds to the density of water at room\ntemperature, $\\simeq$1 $gcm^{-3}$. We applied periodic boundary\nconditions in the three directions and kept the temperature fixed at 298\\,K\nusing Nose-Hoover thermostat. After reaching the equilibrium state, we\ncalculate the shear viscosity using Eq.~(2). The viscosity is found to be\n(4.731$\\pm0.003)\\times10^{-4}$ Pa\\,s which is in agreement with\nthe results obtained from other force fields, e.g. TIP4P yields\n(4.83$\\pm$0.09)$\\times 10^{-4}$ Pa s~\\cite{jpcm}. The experimental viscosity for bulk water is\n$\\simeq$6.0$\\times10^{-4}$\\,Pa s~\\cite{viscexp} at room temperature. The difference between experiment and MD results is likely due to the relatively small unit cell in our  MD simulations.\n\n\n\n\\textbf{B. Shear viscosity  of nanoconfined water}\n\nNext we confine water between two graphene layers while keeping the density of water molecules fixed at $1g/cm^{3}$.\nThe density is given by $\\rho=\\frac{18N}{A N_a(h-t)}$gcm$^{-3}$ for a fixed area $A=43\\times37.5\\AA^2$ (here $N_a$ is Avogadro's constant).~Accordingly, we change the distance between the graphene layers from $h$=7.5\\AA~ to  $h$=20\\AA.~We\nnote that, when estimating the volume of water, one needs to exclude the\nvolume taken up by the graphene layers by using $h-t$ instead of $h$. In our calculations we used $t\\sim 1$\\AA~as an approximation for the atomic diameter of carbon atoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig5}, we show the variation of the shear viscosity with $h$ at room\ntemperature. It is seen that the shear viscosity is much higher than for bulk water either at ambient or elevated pressures~\\cite{viscexp}- see the horizontal dashed lines in Fig. 1. The highest viscosity is found for $h$=7.5\\AA.~As $h$ increases, the  viscosity first decays fast and then starts oscillating as a function of $h$. We have found four minima located at $h$=9, 11.5, 15 and 18\\AA~and four maxima located at $h$=7.5,~10,~13.5, and 16.5\\AA.\n\n~In order to interpret the obtained\nresults, we divide Fig. 1 into five segments shown by different colors and will analyze the structure of\nwater at each minimum and maximum.\n\n\n\\textbf{C. Structures}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn agreement with previous studies ~\\cite{prl2003,nat2015} we\nfound that water confined in the graphene capillary forms\ndistinct layers. In Fig. 2, we show four snapshots of\nthe cross-sectional view of the structure of\nconfined water corresponding to the maxima (a) and\nminima (b) of the shear viscosity. To further\ncharacterize the degree of ordering into layered\nstructures, Figs. 3(a) and (b) show the corresponding\nradial distribution function (RDF) for\nthe O-O distances (for all water molecules) for the\nchannel sizes corresponding to maxima and minima in\nshear viscosity, respectively. Furthermore the\ncorresponding density profiles along the\nperpendicular direction are shown in Fig.~4.\n\n\n\\textbf{\\emph{C. I. Maxima of the shear viscosity}}.\n\n\n\n\nFor the narrowest channel (i.e. $h$=7.5\\AA,~ the first maximum in the viscosity)\na typical snapshot of the water structure is shown in\nFig. 2(a) (top panel).  Notice that two\ndistinct layers of water are formed between the graphene\nwalls, although no ordering was found in the\narrangement of water molecules within the layers.\nFurthermore, the layered structure is very stable: there is no exchange of water molecules between the two layers. The corresponding\nRDF (circles in Fig. 3(a)) has two clear peaks at 2.84 and\n5.4\\AA.~ The first peak corresponds to the nearest\nneighbor average O-O distance and the second peak\nindicates a long range order in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~For the 10\\,\\AA~channel, the first and second peaks in Fig. 3(a) are at 2.84\\,\\AA~ and 5.7\\,\\AA,~ respectively.\n Note that the second peaks for $h$=7.5\\,\\AA~ and 10\\,\\AA~are closer to each other both in height and position than to the (less pronounced) peaks for $h$=15\\,\\AA~ and 16.5\\,\\AA.~Furthermore, the  RDF values for these $h$ are notably larger than the corresponding RDF for $h$=13.5\\AA~ and\n  16.5\\AA.~This indicates a similar long range order for $h$=7.5\\,\\AA~ and 10\\,\\AA,~ with next-nearest neighbor O-O distance of 5.5\\AA~while\n   the distinctiveness of the water layers and the long range order are gradually lost for wider\nchannels.\n\n~In Fig.~4(a), we show the density profile of\n  the water molecules for the channels with $h$=7.5\\,\\AA~ and 10\\,\\AA.~There are three water layers in the $h$=10\\,\\AA~channel, each layer corresponding to a peak in the density profile in Fig.~4(a).  Importantly, while for $h$=7.5\\AA~there is no exchange of water molecules between the layers (the structure is solid-like, i.e. corresponds to ice),  for $h$=10\\AA,~ a `virtual' layer forms with lower density than the `main layers' adjacent to the graphene walls. The water molecules in this virtual layer are in  constant exchange with the main layers. This is the reason that in Fig. 2(a) the middle layer for $h$=10\\,\\AA~looks more diffuse.\n\n\n  The shear viscosity in the $h$=7.5\\AA~channel is almost 8 times\n   higher than that for $h$=10\\,\\AA.~For $h$=13.5\\AA~(16.5\\AA),~the viscosity is further reduced by an order of magnitude. As seen form Fig. 4(b), for these wider channels\n    there are four (five) distinguishable  water layers with two denser, well-defined layers adjacent to the graphene walls and more diffuse intermediate layers with almost uniform distribution of water molecules, especially for $h=$16.5\\AA.~\n\\begin{table*}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n $h$(\\AA)     & $d$(\\AA)& $\\delta$(\\AA)     \\\\\n\\hline\n$7.5$          &  2.4$\\pm$0.1 & 2.5$\\pm$0.1      \\\\\n$10$           & 2.4$\\pm$0.1 & 2.6$\\pm$0.1    \\\\\n\n\n\\hline\\hline\n$9$       &     3.6$\\pm$0.2 & 2.7$\\pm$0.2 \\\\\n$11.5$         &  3.0$\\pm$0.2& 2.7$\\pm$0.3   \\\\\n\n\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\par\n\\caption {The  distance between water layers, i.e. $d$, and the distance between the two main water layers and\nthe graphene walls, i.e. $\\delta$.}\n\\label{Table:HystV}\n\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\textbf{\\emph{C. II. Minima of the shear viscosity}}.\n\nWater molecules in the channel with $h$=9\\,\\AA ~form two layers adjacent to the\ngraphene walls (main layers), somewhat similar to the\n$h$=7.5\\AA~ channel where the highest viscosity is observed.\nHowever, in this case, there are also many water molecules\nbetween the two layers that effectively connect the main\nlayers with each other (see Figs. 2(b) and 4(c)). For the\n$h$=11.5\\AA~ channel such water molecules clearly form a\nmiddle layer. However, this middle layer is not\nstable: its water molecules constantly hop between the top\nand bottom layers (main layers). This movement of water between the layers can be seen in provided Supplementary Movies~\\cite{supp}. We note that the number of water layers formed in the\ngraphene channel for $h$=9\\AA~ and $h$=11.5\\AA~ is in agreement\nwith the MD results~\\cite{nat2015}.\n\n For $h$=15\nand 18\\AA~ channels the middle layers become almost\nindistinct (see density profiles in Fig. 4(d)), again with water\nmolecules in intermediate layers constantly hopping and\nconnecting the two main layers adjacent to the graphene\nwalls. It is this hopping of water molecules between the main\nlayers that plays an essential role in decreasing the shear\nviscosity.\n\nIn fact, at the minima the viscosity of confined water becomes\nof the same order as for bulk water at ambient pressure~\\cite{viscexp} (the latter is shown In Fig. 1). This is\nconsistent with the absence of a stable layered structure due\nto the constant exchange of water molecules between the\nlayers (20$\\%$ of water molecules hop between the main layers).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to compare the dynamic properties of water corresponding to, for example, the first maximum and the first minimum of the shear viscosity, we performed two long time simulations for $h$=7.5\\AA~and $h$=9\\AA.~The results for a time series of the variation of z-component of the center of mass of confined water molecules\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nZ_{cm}(t)=\\frac{\\sum_{i}^{N(h)} Z_i(t)}{N(h)},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Z_{cm}(t)=\\frac{\\sum_{i}^{N(h)}Z_{i}(t)}{N(h)},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>Z</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>h</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></msubsup><mrow><msub><mi>Z</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>h</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02139.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $d$ is the distance between the water layers, $n$ is the number of water layers, and $\\delta$ is the distance between the graphene sheets and one of the adjacent water layers.\nWe would expect that in general (ignoring the incommensurate effects and for a constant water density) $h_i$ should be only a function of `$n$' and consequently\n $\\delta\\cong\\delta_0\\cong2.7$\\AA~ should be independent of $h$.\nIn order to find  $\\delta$ and $d$, we performed several annealing MD simulations by cooling the system down to zero\nKelvin and were able to calculate $\\delta$ and $d$ which are listed in Table I.\nIn contrast to expectations, the obtained $d$ (and calculated $\\delta=\\frac{h-(n-1) d}{2}$),  for the two first maxima and minima indicate that $\\delta$ and $d$  are a\n   function of $h$.

The larger fluctuations of $Z_{cm}$ yield diffusive motion of water molecules along $Z$ which reduces the shear viscosity.\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Discussions and conclusions}\n\nOur molecular dynamics simulations reveal the strong sensitivity of the shear viscosity of confined water\n to the size of the confining channel. Increasing the channel size, even by as little as 1\\AA,~results in changes of the shear viscosity by more than an\n order of magnitude. Distinct layering of water confined between the graphene layers is apparent only for particular channel sizes.\nWe also find that i) independent of $h$,  two\n  `main layers' of water are always formed, adjacent to the graphene walls (which also have the largest number of water molecules as compared to the intermediate layers), ii) as $h$  increases beyond 15-16\\AA,~the middle layers become mixed, and  we\nobtain almost bulk water between the two  main water layers, and iii) the first peak in the O-O distance, corresponding to the nearest layer separation\noccurs around 2.84\\AA,~ almost independent of $h$, while the location of the second peak (next-nearest layer separation) depends on $h$.\n\n\n\nFrom our analysis, it is clear that\nthe shear viscosity of confined water is related to the commensurability\nbetween the size of the channel and the space\nrequired to accommodate one layer of water molecules. For $h$\nvalues corresponding to low shear viscosity (of the same\norder as the shear viscosity of bulk water), e.g. for $h$=9\nand 11.5\\AA,~ confined water is commensurate with the\nchannel size $h$. The latter results in minima in the shear viscosity.

The layering of confined liquid and the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between the tip and the surface are the main reasons for these oscillations~\\cite{chemRev}. Cleveland\\emph{ et al.}~\\cite{Cleveland} observed hopping of the hydrophilic tip between four discrete levels with an average spacing of 2\\AA.~ They also observed several minima in the potential with spacings varying between 1.5 and 3.0\\AA,~which are comparable to the size of a water molecule. It can be speculated that the force minima and force maxima are due to the formation of liquid-like and a solid-like structure of water, respectively, as found in our work. A solid behavior of the confined water between tip and a gold surface was reported in scanning tunneling microscopy measurements when the tip-surface distance is $h$=7\\AA~\\cite{STM}, which is consistent with our finding for $h$=7.5\\AA~case.\n\n\nIn summary, we show that the shear viscosity of confined\nwater is controlled by the interplay between the spacing of the\nwater layers and the width of the nanochannel: The viscosity\noscillates with $h$ in such a way that it is minimum for the\ncommensurate cases (where $\\delta\\geq\\delta_0$ and and $d>$3\\AA)~and it reaches\na maximum for the incommensurate cases (where $\\delta<\\delta_0$  and $d<$3\\AA).~This is in contrast to earlier MD simulations (e.g.,\nrefs.~\\cite{nanscale,Babu}) where monotonically decreasing viscosity was\nfound for a decreasing channel size, presumably due to\nthe different model used for water (TIP3P and TIP4P-EW,  where the dipole/charge on each molrcule/atom is constant) and a different method for viscosity calculation (Eyring-MD method). As the channel size becomes larger than $~$2\\,nm,\nthe shear viscosity decreases and approaches the viscosity of\nbulk water. This is in agreement with experiments that\nindicate that the viscosity of a liquid confined between two\nsurfaces with $h>$2-3\\,nm remains close to that in the bulk\n~\\cite{jnc}.\n\n\nOur findings have an important implication that the\nslippage of water should also be strongly affected by the\ndetails of its molecular structure and the subnanometer\nchanges in the channel size. Indeed, AFM measurements on\na few-molecule thick layer of water confined between mica\nand an AFM tip found that dynamics of such water is\ndetermined predominantly by solvation effects that depend\non the exact separation between the tip and the surface~\\cite{hoffman}.\n\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that we performed\nseveral additional simulations for different\ndensities of confined water (which varied between\n1.7gcm$^{-3}$ and 0.7gcm$^{-3}$) and found the\nsame decreasing and oscillating behavior of the\nshear viscosity. In these simulations we fixed the\nnumber of water molecules to N=2016 and\nchanged the distance between the graphene layers.\nThe shear viscosity for the highest density (1.7gcm$^{-3}$ for $h$=7.5\\AA)~ is found to be close to 1.0 Pa s\nwhich is just twice that for water of density 1\\,gcm$^{-3}$  in a $h$=7.5\\AA~ channel shown in Fig. 2(a). Therefore the density of water can control its shear viscosity in a similar way as the channel size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{References}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{13}\n\n\\bibitem{JCHEMPHYS}  Kannam, S.
