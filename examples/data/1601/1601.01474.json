After a first section of preliminaries, in Section \\ref{s3} we establish the global behavior of every ${\\cal\nC}^2$ solution $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ to the Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$. We show that for every singular point $p_i$ there exists at least a sector $S_i\\subseteq{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}$ such that the graph of $u$ over $S_i$ is a piece of a cone. Moreover, there exists at most a maximal strip $S$ such that the graph of $u$ over $S$ is a cylinder. As a consequence of these results, we obtain that if $u$ is an analytic solution then there is at most one singularity, and the graph of $u$ is either a cylinder if there is no singularity or a cone if there is one singularity.\n\nIn Section \\ref{s4} we classify all solutions to (\\ref{the-equation}) with one or two singularities. In particular, if  $u$ is a solution with one singularity at $p_0$ then, either the graph of $u$ is a cone or there exists a line $r$ containing to $p_0$ such that the graph of $u$ is a cylinder over one half-plane determined by $r$ and a cone over the other half-plane. We also describe every solution in the twice punctured plane.\n\nAlthough the behavior of a solution $u$ to (\\ref{the-equation}) with more than two singularities can be complicated, due to the existence of some regions in the $(x,y)-$plane where $u$ is a linear function, we classify in Section \\ref{s5} every solution which does not admit a large region where $u$ is linear, that is, every solution such that the domain where $u$ is linear does not contain a half-strip of ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$. In such  case, we show that the singular points are the vertices of a convex compact polyhedron $C\\subseteq{\\mathbb{R}}^2$ with non empty interior, the solution $u$ must be linear over $C$ and the graph of $u$ is made by some cones over ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash C$ which are suitably glued along the segments of the boundary of the planar polyhedron $u(C)$.\n\n\\section{Preliminaries.}\n\nLet $\\Omega\\subseteq{\\mathbb{R}}^2$ be a domain, and $u:\\Omega{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be a function of class ${\\cal C}^2$ satisfying the degenerate Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation\n$u_{xx}u_{yy}-u_{xy}^2=0,$ in $\\Omega.$\nAs we mentioned in the introduction, it is well known that every solution $u(x,y)$ to the degenerate Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation in the whole plane ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ is given by\n$u(x,y)=\\alpha(x)+c_0\\,y,$ up to a rotation in the $(x,y)$-plane (see \\cite{HN, Ma, P}), that is, its graph is a cylinder.\n\nThus, it is natural to study the solutions to the degenerate Monge-Amp\\`ere equation in the possible largest domains.

As a consequence, if $r_0$ has a point $q$ in the interior of ${\\cal U}$, $int({\\cal U})$, then $r_0$ is contained in $int({\\cal U})$.\n\nHence, if $r_0=r(q)\\subseteq{\\cal N}$ then the image of $r_0$ is the line $R(q)$, and if $r_0\\subseteq int({\\cal U})$ then the image of $r_0$ is a line, because the image of each connected component of $int({\\cal U})$ is a piece of a plane. Thus, the image of  $r_0$ must also be a line if  $r_0\\subseteq \\partial{\\cal N}=\\partial (int({\\cal U}))$.\n\nTherefore, $u$ is given in $S(p)$ by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 11124, "prevtext": "\nwhere $grad_p(u)$ denotes the gradient of $u$ at a point $p$.\n\nLet us see that the modulus of the gradient of $u$ is less than or equal to $m$ for every point $p\\in\\overline{D}_{p_0}(\\varepsilon)\\backslash\\{p_0\\}$.\n\nLet $p\\in{\\cal N}$, then the piece of line $r(p)$ has at least a point $q$ in the boundary of the disk $\\overline{D}_{p_0}(\\varepsilon)$.

Up to a translation and a rotation, we can assume $p$ is the origin and a singular end point of $r(p)$ is $(x_1,0)$ with $x_1<0$.\n\nSince ${\\cal N}$ is an open set, we consider $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the open disk $D(\\varepsilon)$ centered at the origin with radius $\\varepsilon$ is contained in ${\\cal N}$. Moreover, using that the set of singular points is finite, $\\varepsilon$ can be chosen small enough in such a way there is no singular point $p_k=(x_k,y_k)$ with $0<|y_k|<\\varepsilon$.\n\nLet $q_n=(x_n,y_n)$ be a sequence in $D(\\varepsilon)^+=\\{(x,y)\\in D(\\varepsilon):y>0\\}$ going to $p=(0,0)$. Observe that the number of segments of the form $r(q)$ contained in ${\\cal N}$ can only be finite because the number of singularities is finite. Thus, replacing $q_n$ by a point close to it, we can assume $r(q_n)$ is a half-line or a line, for every point $q_n$ of the sequence. Since $r(q_n)$ cannot intersect $r(p)$, the angle between $r(q_n)$ and $r(p)$ tends to zero.\n\nIf there exists a subsequence $q_m$ such that $r(q_m)$ are lines, then all of them must be parallel and, from Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, $r(q)$ is a horizontal line for all $q=(x,y)\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$.\n\nOtherwise, since the number of singularities is finite, there exists a subsequence $q_m$ such that $r(q_m)$ are half-lines with the same singular end point $p_{i_1}$. Thus, as the angle between $r(q_m)$ and $r(p)$ tends to zero, $p_{i_1}$ is necessarily placed on the line $y=0$. In particular, taking $\\varepsilon$ small enough, we can assume that the sector made of all half-lines containing a point $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$ and with end point at $p_{i_1}$ does not contain another singular point. Hence, each half-line of this sector with end point $p_{i_1}$ is of the form $r(q)$ for $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$.\n\nAnalogously, we can follow the same reasoning for $D(\\varepsilon)^-=\\{(x,y)\\in D(\\varepsilon):y<0\\}$. Thus, $r(q)$ is a  horizontal line for all  $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^-$, or $r(q)$ is a half-line for all $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^-$ with the same singular end point $p_{i_2}$, placed at the line $y=0$.\n\nNow, let us denote by $S^+$ the strip $\\{(x,y)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2:0<y<\\varepsilon\\}$ if $r(q)$ is a horizontal line for all $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$, or the sector containing $D(\\varepsilon)^+$ with vertex at $p_{i_1}$ if $r(q)$ is a half-line for all $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$. We also denote $S^-$ the corresponding set for the points in $D(\\varepsilon)^-$.\n\nFrom Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, $S^+$ and $S^-$ cannot be two strips because the point $(x_1,0)$ is singular. Moreover, from Lemma \\ref{l4}, $S^+$ and $S^-$ are two sectors with the same vertex $p_{i_1}=p_{i_2}$ because otherwise $p=(0,0)$ would be contained in ${\\cal U}$. Thus, from Lemma \\ref{l3}, if $r$ is the half-line containing $p=(0,0)$ with end point $p_{i_1}=p_{i_2}$ then a point in $r$ is a singular point if and only if every point in $r$ is singular. Hence, $p_{i_1}=p_{i_2}=(x_1,0)$ and $r(p)$ cannot be a segment.\n\nThis proves that if $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a half-line then there exists $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $D_p(\\varepsilon)\\subseteq{\\cal N}$ and for all $q\\in D_p(\\varepsilon)$ the set $r(q)$ is a half-line with the same end point. That is, ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$ is an open set.\n\\end{proof}\n\nAs a consequence of Propositions \\ref{max-strip} and \\ref{l5},  we get the following result.\n\n\\begin{cor}\n\\label{c0}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be a ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$. If $V$ is a connected component of\n${\\cal N}$ then either  $V$ is made of parallel lines or $V$ is made of half-lines with  common endpoint at some $p_i.$\n\\end{cor}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{cor}\\label{c1}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be a ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$. Then the set ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$, given by (\\ref{npi}), is a non empty union of open sectors with vertex at $p_i$, for every singularity $p_i$. In particular, $u$ is a conical function in each connected component of ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$.\n\n\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nFrom Proposition \\ref{l5} and Lemma \\ref{l3}, we only need to show that ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$ is non empty for each singular point $p_i$. So, fix a singular point $p_i$ and assume ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$ is empty.\n\nIf there existed a punctured  neighborhood $U$ of $p_i$ contained in ${\\cal U}$ then the image of $U$ would lie in a plane and $p_i$ would not be a singular point. Thus, there must exist a sequence $q_n\\in{\\cal N}$ going to $p_i$. Moreover, a subsequence $q_m$ must satisfy that $r(q_m)$ is a line for all $m$ (and so the lines are parallel) or $r(q_m)$ is a half-line for all $m$ with a common singular end point $p_{j}\\neq p_{i}$. Up to a translation and a rotation, we can assume $p_i$ is the origin and the limit line of the lines containing $r(q_m)$ is $y=0$. In particular, in the latter case $p_j$ is placed in the line $y=0$.\n\nObserve that $q_m$ cannot be placed in the segment joining the singular points $p_i$ and $p_j$, that is, in any case, every point $q_m$ is in the open upper half-space ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_+=\\{(x,y)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2:y>0\\}$ or in the open lower half-space ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_-=\\{(x,y)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2:y<0\\}$.\n\nPassing to a subsequence, if necessary, we can assume $q_m$ is contained in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_+$ for all $m$, or  $q_m$ is contained in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ for all $m$. Suppose $q_m\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2_+$ for every $m$. If $r(q_m)$ is a line for each $m$ then we denote by $S^+$ the maximal strip determined by Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, which satisfies that the line $y=0$ is in its closure. If $r(q_m)$ is a half-line for all $m$ then for $m$ big enough the open sector determined by $r(q_m)$ and $y=0$ does not contain any singular point, and we call $S^+$ to this sector. In the first case the function $u$ would be cylindrical in $S^+$ (Proposition \\ref{max-strip}), and in the second case $u$ would be conical in $S^+$ (Lemma \\ref{l3}) with vertex at $p_j\\neq p_i$.\n\nOn the other hand, there must exist a sequence of points in ${\\cal N}\\cap{\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ going to $p_i$. Otherwise there would exist $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the open half-disk $D(\\varepsilon)\\cap{\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ is contained in ${\\cal U}$. Thus, the image of $D(\\varepsilon)\\cap{\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ lies in a plane. But, since $u$ is cylindrical or conical in $S^+$ then the origin $p_i$ is a singular point if and only if every point of a neighborhood of $p_i$ in the line $y=0$ is singular, which gives us a contradiction.\nThus, the previous sequence exists and we can define $S^-$ in an analogous way.\n\nSo, $u$ will be cylindrical or conical in $S^+$ and in $S^-$. But, in any case, this is again a contradiction because $p_i$ would be a singular point if and only if every point of a neighborhood of $p_i$ in the line $y=0$ is singular.  Hence ${\\cal N}_{p_i}\\not=\\emptyset.$\n\\end{proof}\n\nAs a consequence we obtain a first global classification result.\n\\begin{teo}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be an analytic solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$.\nThen, either there is no singular point and $u$ is a cylindrical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$, or there is a unique singular point and $u$ is a conical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1\\}$.\n\\end{teo}\n\\begin{proof}\nThe result is well known if there is no singular point \\cite{HN,P}. Otherwise, up to a translation, we can assume that the origin is a singular point. So, for polar coordinates $(\\rho,\\theta)$, the function $u(\\rho,\\theta)$ is analytic and, from the previous Corollary, $u_{\\rho\\rho}$ vanishes identically in the non empty open set ${\\cal N}_{(0,0)}$. Therefore, $u_{\\rho\\rho}$ must vanish globally, that is, $u$ is a conical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\section{Entire solutions with one or two singularities.}\\label{s4}\n\nWe devote this Section to the characterization of the entire solutions to the degenerate Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation $u_{xx}u_{yy}-u_{xy}^2=0$, where $u$ is a ${\\cal C}^2$ function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ minus one or two points. These results will be a consequence of the global results studied in the previous Section.\n\nWe first prove that there only exist two different kinds of solutions in the punctured plane.\n\\begin{teo}\\label{t2}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be a ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with an isolated singularity at the origin. Then, $u$ is given by one of the following cases (Figure \\ref{fig1}):\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $u$ is a conical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}$, or\n\\item there exists a line $r$ containing the origin such that $u$ is a cylindrical function in one half-plane determined by $r$, and $u$ is a conical function in the other half-plane.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{teo}\n\\begin{proof}\nFrom Corollary \\ref{c1}, ${\\cal N}$ cannot be empty. Thus, if there is no point $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a line then, from Lemma \\ref{l3}, $u$ is a conical solution in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a point $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a line then, from Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, there exists an open half-plane $S(p)$, containing $r(p)$, such that $u$ is a cylindrical function in $S(p)$. Moreover, the boundary of $S(p)$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ is a line $r$ containing the singular point $(0,0)$. If $S^-$ is the other open half-plane determined by $r$, again Proposition \\ref{max-strip} gives that $r(q)$ must be a half-line for every point $q\\in{\\cal N}\\cap S^-$. Hence, $u$ is a conical function in $S^-$, by Lemma \\ref{l3}.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale =0.6]{Figura1a} \\hspace{2cm} \\includegraphics[scale =0.6]{Figura1b}}\\vspace{-1.5cm}\n\\caption[]{solutions with one singularity.}\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow we present some families of examples of solutions to the equation (\\ref{the-equation}) in the twice punctured plane.\n\\begin{eje}\\label{ej1}{\\em\nConsider an open strip $S$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ so that its boundary is given by two lines $r_1,r_2$.

Then, from Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, there exists a maximal open strip $S(p)$ which is contained in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,p_2\\}$ such that each connected component of its boundary in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ has at least a singular point. Moreover, $u$ is a cylindrical function in $S(p)$.\n\n{\\it Case 1.1:} If the boundary of $S(p)$ is made by two lines, then each line must contain one of the two singular points. In addition, if a point $q\\in{\\cal N}$ is not in the strip $S(p)$ then $r(q)$ is a half-line with end point at a singular one. Hence, from Lemma \\ref{l3}, $u$ is a conical function in each half-plane of ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\overline{S(p)}$ and is determined by Example \\ref{ej1}.\n\n{\\it Case 1.2:} If the boundary of $S(p)$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ is only one line, then two different situations can happen. Up to a translation or rotation, we can assume $S(p)$ is the open half-plane $y<0$:\n\n{\\it Case 1.2.1:} If both singularities are in the boundary of $S(p)$ then we can write $p_1=(x_1,0)$, $p_2=(x_2,0)$, with $x_1<x_2$. Then, from Lemma \\ref{desconexion}, there exists $\\theta_0\\in(0,\\pi)$ such that ${\\cal N}_{p_2}$ is contained in the open sector with vertex at $p_2$ and angles between $0$ and $\\theta_0$:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 33451, "prevtext": "\nis an open set.\n\n\\end{pro}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is either a segment or a half-line. Up to a translation and a rotation, we can assume $p$ is the origin and a singular end point of $r(p)$ is $(x_1,0)$ with $x_1<0$.\n\nSince ${\\cal N}$ is an open set, we consider $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the open disk $D(\\varepsilon)$ centered at the origin with radius $\\varepsilon$ is contained in ${\\cal N}$. Moreover, using that the set of singular points is finite, $\\varepsilon$ can be chosen small enough in such a way there is no singular point $p_k=(x_k,y_k)$ with $0<|y_k|<\\varepsilon$.\n\nLet $q_n=(x_n,y_n)$ be a sequence in $D(\\varepsilon)^+=\\{(x,y)\\in D(\\varepsilon):y>0\\}$ going to $p=(0,0)$. Observe that the number of segments of the form $r(q)$ contained in ${\\cal N}$ can only be finite because the number of singularities is finite. Thus, replacing $q_n$ by a point close to it, we can assume $r(q_n)$ is a half-line or a line, for every point $q_n$ of the sequence. Since $r(q_n)$ cannot intersect $r(p)$, the angle between $r(q_n)$ and $r(p)$ tends to zero.\n\nIf there exists a subsequence $q_m$ such that $r(q_m)$ are lines, then all of them must be parallel and, from Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, $r(q)$ is a horizontal line for all $q=(x,y)\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$.\n\nOtherwise, since the number of singularities is finite, there exists a subsequence $q_m$ such that $r(q_m)$ are half-lines with the same singular end point $p_{i_1}$. Thus, as the angle between $r(q_m)$ and $r(p)$ tends to zero, $p_{i_1}$ is necessarily placed on the line $y=0$. In particular, taking $\\varepsilon$ small enough, we can assume that the sector made of all half-lines containing a point $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$ and with end point at $p_{i_1}$ does not contain another singular point. Hence, each half-line of this sector with end point $p_{i_1}$ is of the form $r(q)$ for $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$.\n\nAnalogously, we can follow the same reasoning for $D(\\varepsilon)^-=\\{(x,y)\\in D(\\varepsilon):y<0\\}$. Thus, $r(q)$ is a  horizontal line for all  $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^-$, or $r(q)$ is a half-line for all $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^-$ with the same singular end point $p_{i_2}$, placed at the line $y=0$.\n\nNow, let us denote by $S^+$ the strip $\\{(x,y)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2:0<y<\\varepsilon\\}$ if $r(q)$ is a horizontal line for all $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$, or the sector containing $D(\\varepsilon)^+$ with vertex at $p_{i_1}$ if $r(q)$ is a half-line for all $q\\in D(\\varepsilon)^+$. We also denote $S^-$ the corresponding set for the points in $D(\\varepsilon)^-$.\n\nFrom Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, $S^+$ and $S^-$ cannot be two strips because the point $(x_1,0)$ is singular. Moreover, from Lemma \\ref{l4}, $S^+$ and $S^-$ are two sectors with the same vertex $p_{i_1}=p_{i_2}$ because otherwise $p=(0,0)$ would be contained in ${\\cal U}$. Thus, from Lemma \\ref{l3}, if $r$ is the half-line containing $p=(0,0)$ with end point $p_{i_1}=p_{i_2}$ then a point in $r$ is a singular point if and only if every point in $r$ is singular. Hence, $p_{i_1}=p_{i_2}=(x_1,0)$ and $r(p)$ cannot be a segment.\n\nThis proves that if $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a half-line then there exists $\\varepsilon>0$ such that $D_p(\\varepsilon)\\subseteq{\\cal N}$ and for all $q\\in D_p(\\varepsilon)$ the set $r(q)$ is a half-line with the same end point. That is, ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$ is an open set.\n\\end{proof}\n\nAs a consequence of Propositions \\ref{max-strip} and \\ref{l5},  we get the following result.\n\n\\begin{cor}\n\\label{c0}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be a ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$. If $V$ is a connected component of\n${\\cal N}$ then either  $V$ is made of parallel lines or $V$ is made of half-lines with  common endpoint at some $p_i.$\n\\end{cor}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{cor}\\label{c1}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be a ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$. Then the set ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$, given by (\\ref{npi}), is a non empty union of open sectors with vertex at $p_i$, for every singularity $p_i$. In particular, $u$ is a conical function in each connected component of ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$.\n\n\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nFrom Proposition \\ref{l5} and Lemma \\ref{l3}, we only need to show that ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$ is non empty for each singular point $p_i$. So, fix a singular point $p_i$ and assume ${\\cal N}_{p_i}$ is empty.\n\nIf there existed a punctured  neighborhood $U$ of $p_i$ contained in ${\\cal U}$ then the image of $U$ would lie in a plane and $p_i$ would not be a singular point. Thus, there must exist a sequence $q_n\\in{\\cal N}$ going to $p_i$. Moreover, a subsequence $q_m$ must satisfy that $r(q_m)$ is a line for all $m$ (and so the lines are parallel) or $r(q_m)$ is a half-line for all $m$ with a common singular end point $p_{j}\\neq p_{i}$. Up to a translation and a rotation, we can assume $p_i$ is the origin and the limit line of the lines containing $r(q_m)$ is $y=0$. In particular, in the latter case $p_j$ is placed in the line $y=0$.\n\nObserve that $q_m$ cannot be placed in the segment joining the singular points $p_i$ and $p_j$, that is, in any case, every point $q_m$ is in the open upper half-space ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_+=\\{(x,y)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2:y>0\\}$ or in the open lower half-space ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_-=\\{(x,y)\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2:y<0\\}$.\n\nPassing to a subsequence, if necessary, we can assume $q_m$ is contained in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_+$ for all $m$, or  $q_m$ is contained in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ for all $m$. Suppose $q_m\\in{\\mathbb{R}}^2_+$ for every $m$. If $r(q_m)$ is a line for each $m$ then we denote by $S^+$ the maximal strip determined by Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, which satisfies that the line $y=0$ is in its closure. If $r(q_m)$ is a half-line for all $m$ then for $m$ big enough the open sector determined by $r(q_m)$ and $y=0$ does not contain any singular point, and we call $S^+$ to this sector. In the first case the function $u$ would be cylindrical in $S^+$ (Proposition \\ref{max-strip}), and in the second case $u$ would be conical in $S^+$ (Lemma \\ref{l3}) with vertex at $p_j\\neq p_i$.\n\nOn the other hand, there must exist a sequence of points in ${\\cal N}\\cap{\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ going to $p_i$. Otherwise there would exist $\\varepsilon>0$ such that the open half-disk $D(\\varepsilon)\\cap{\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ is contained in ${\\cal U}$. Thus, the image of $D(\\varepsilon)\\cap{\\mathbb{R}}^2_-$ lies in a plane. But, since $u$ is cylindrical or conical in $S^+$ then the origin $p_i$ is a singular point if and only if every point of a neighborhood of $p_i$ in the line $y=0$ is singular, which gives us a contradiction.\nThus, the previous sequence exists and we can define $S^-$ in an analogous way.\n\nSo, $u$ will be cylindrical or conical in $S^+$ and in $S^-$. But, in any case, this is again a contradiction because $p_i$ would be a singular point if and only if every point of a neighborhood of $p_i$ in the line $y=0$ is singular.  Hence ${\\cal N}_{p_i}\\not=\\emptyset.$\n\\end{proof}\n\nAs a consequence we obtain a first global classification result.\n\\begin{teo}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be an analytic solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$.\nThen, either there is no singular point and $u$ is a cylindrical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$, or there is a unique singular point and $u$ is a conical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1\\}$.\n\\end{teo}\n\\begin{proof}\nThe result is well known if there is no singular point \\cite{HN,P}. Otherwise, up to a translation, we can assume that the origin is a singular point. So, for polar coordinates $(\\rho,\\theta)$, the function $u(\\rho,\\theta)$ is analytic and, from the previous Corollary, $u_{\\rho\\rho}$ vanishes identically in the non empty open set ${\\cal N}_{(0,0)}$. Therefore, $u_{\\rho\\rho}$ must vanish globally, that is, $u$ is a conical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\section{Entire solutions with one or two singularities.}\\label{s4}\n\nWe devote this Section to the characterization of the entire solutions to the degenerate Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation $u_{xx}u_{yy}-u_{xy}^2=0$, where $u$ is a ${\\cal C}^2$ function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ minus one or two points. These results will be a consequence of the global results studied in the previous Section.\n\nWe first prove that there only exist two different kinds of solutions in the punctured plane.\n\\begin{teo}\\label{t2}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be a ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with an isolated singularity at the origin. Then, $u$ is given by one of the following cases (Figure \\ref{fig1}):\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $u$ is a conical function in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}$, or\n\\item there exists a line $r$ containing the origin such that $u$ is a cylindrical function in one half-plane determined by $r$, and $u$ is a conical function in the other half-plane.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{teo}\n\\begin{proof}\nFrom Corollary \\ref{c1}, ${\\cal N}$ cannot be empty. Thus, if there is no point $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a line then, from Lemma \\ref{l3}, $u$ is a conical solution in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{(0,0)\\}$.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a point $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a line then, from Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, there exists an open half-plane $S(p)$, containing $r(p)$, such that $u$ is a cylindrical function in $S(p)$. Moreover, the boundary of $S(p)$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ is a line $r$ containing the singular point $(0,0)$. If $S^-$ is the other open half-plane determined by $r$, again Proposition \\ref{max-strip} gives that $r(q)$ must be a half-line for every point $q\\in{\\cal N}\\cap S^-$. Hence, $u$ is a conical function in $S^-$, by Lemma \\ref{l3}.\n\\end{proof}\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale =0.6]{Figura1a} \\hspace{2cm} \\includegraphics[scale =0.6]{Figura1b}}\\vspace{-1.5cm}\n\\caption[]{solutions with one singularity.}\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow we present some families of examples of solutions to the equation (\\ref{the-equation}) in the twice punctured plane.\n\\begin{eje}\\label{ej1}{\\em\nConsider an open strip $S$ in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ so that its boundary is given by two lines $r_1,r_2$.

But, this is a contradiction since ${\\cal N}_{p_m}\\cap{\\cal N}_{p_M}\\neq\\emptyset$ (see Figure \\ref{pm}).\n\\end{proof}\n\nAs a consequence we will prove that an admissible solution to (\\ref{the-equation}), with a point $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a line, must be given by Case 2 in Theorem \\ref{t2} or by Example \\ref{ej1}.\n\\begin{cor}\\label{c2}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be an admissible ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$. If there exists a point $p\\in{\\cal N}$ such that $r(p)$ is a line, then there are exactly one or two singular points.\n\\end{cor}\n\\begin{proof}\nFrom Proposition \\ref{max-strip}, there exists an open strip $S(p)$ containing $r(p)$ such that its boundary in ${\\mathbb{R}}^2$ is given by one or two lines parallel to $r(p)$. Moreover, if $r_0$ is a line of $\\partial S(p)$ then $r_0$ contains at least a singular point $p_{i_0}$.\n\nWe need to show that if $H_0$ is the closed half-plane determined by $r_0$ which does not contain $S(p)$ then the unique singular point in $H_0$ is $p_{i_0}$.\n\nLet $V$ be a connected component of ${\\cal N}_{p_{i_0}}$. The set $V$ is an open sector contained in $H_0$ with vertex at $p_{i_0}$.\n\nIf $H_0\\backslash V=r_0$ then there is no singular point different from $p_{i_0}$. Otherwise, if there exists another singular point $p_j\\in H_0$ then $p_j\\in r_0$ and the non empty set ${\\cal N}_{p_j}$ would intersect ${\\cal N}_{p_{i_0}}$ or $S(p)$.\n\nIf $H_0\\backslash V\\neq r_0$, then $H_0\\backslash (V\\cup\\{p_{i_0}\\})$ has one or two connected components with non empty interior. The adherence of each component with non empty interior is a closed sector with vertex at $p_{i_0}$ in the conditions of Lemma \\ref{angulo}. Therefore, there is no singular point in $H_0$ except $p_{i_0}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nAs a main result in this Section, we classify all the admissible solutions to the degenerate Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation with more than two singularities (see Figure \\ref{four-vertex}).\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale =0.5]{four-vertex}}\n\\caption[]{Admissible solution with four singular points.}\n\\label{four-vertex}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{teo}\nLet $u:{\\mathbb{R}}^2\\backslash\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}{\\longrightarrow}{\\mathbb{R}}$ be an admissible ${\\cal C}^2$ solution of (\\ref{the-equation}) with isolated singularities at the points $p_i$ and $n\\geq3$.
