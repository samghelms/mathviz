This aim is usually hindered by the limited spectral resolution of the light source employed. To tackle this limitation experimentalists traditionally resort to line stabilized, high resolution light sources along with doppler free spectroscopy techniques \\cite{Paul2010} or supersonic sample cooling \\cite{Metcalf2012}. These techniques present, however, the inconvenience to involve relatively elaborated experimental arrangements. \n\nHere, we present a novel mathematical technique aimed to help experimentalists increasing the spectral resolution of their data whilst detecting real transitions hindered by the original poor resolution of their experimental data. This technique, called Super-Resolution, is based on the mathematical tools developed within the scope of Compressed Sensing (CS) \\cite{CandesRombergTao06,CandesWakin2008}. \n\nThe basic idea behind CS is that,  under the {\\it a priori} knowledge that a signal or an image has a sparse representation (see below), then it can be reconstructed from far fewer data/measurements as  compared  to those required  by the well known Shannon/Nyquist sampling theory \\cite{Candes06-2}. \n\nHere, the term sparsity means that there exist a basis in the space of functions (e.g. a Fourier basis or Wavelets) where the signal can be represented by a small number of the elements in such a basis.\n\nIn spectroscopy, a spectrum of a single element or molecule can be represented as a linear combination of single peaks of a similar shape center at specific transition wavelength values.\n\nIn this case, the spectrum can be represented by a small number of parameters, namely the locations of the peaks, their width and their amplitude. \n\nThese parameters constitute the sparse representation in this case.\\\\\nIn a general context, Compressed Sensing can be regarded as an optimal sampling and \ninterpolation algorithm for sparse signals in the appropriate base. \n\nAlong the ideas of CS, some new versions algorithmic or computational Super-Resolution (SR) algorithms \nhave been developed.  SR algorithms have  been successfully applied to many practical cases, including \nmedical imaging \\cite{Hayit}, satellite imaging, and video applications\n(for instance sec. 1.2 in \\cite{FocautRauhut2010} and  the references within). \n\nIn this context, SR algorithms can be applied to the particular case of spectroscopy to recover high resolution features such as peak centers, from the experimental data. This kind of mathematical problem  can be treated by the recently developed mathematical theory of Super-Resolution by Cand\\`es and Fernandez-Granda \\cite{Candes,Candes2}.\n\n\nThe aim of this paper is to show that SR algorithms can  also be a valuable tool in spectral analysis \nthat can help to separate peaks that cannot be separated from the original data due to instrumental \nlimitations in resolution \\cite{Dror,Pavel}.\n\nIn particular, we show here that the SR algorithm can dramatically \nimprove the resolution of measurements, in particular allowing a \nsurprising effective $70$-fold reduction in the linewidth of the spectral measurements. \n\nThis improvement allows us to separate apart structures that are not separated \non our original experimental data. \n\nTo test and quantitatively show the power of the SR technique we present here \nexperimental optogalvanic spectra of well known Neon and Argon transitions that \nshow dramatic improvements in the resolved features after the SR post processing algorithm. \n\nThe optogalvanic effect (OGE) is currently an active research area both in fundamental studies \non plasma discharges as well as in technological applications. \n\nThe OGE consist of a change in the total current of a plasma when it interact with laser light with a wavelength corresponding to an atomic or molecular transition of the gas species present in the plasma \\cite{Barbieri}.\n\nAlthough the specific example shown here is devoted to the OGE effect we believe SR can be applied in other types of spectroscopy, including photoionization, photoabsorption, Raman or others. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge this is the first application of SR algorithms based on CS ideas to improving  the resolution of spectroscopic measurements.\n\n\\section{Super-Resolution algorithms}\\label{Superresolution}\n\nIn any imaging system the resolution limit is measured by the shortest separation between two features, \nsuch as point sources, before they mingle into one. The limitations of the instrument used and, on a more \nfundamental level, the diffraction limit set the constraint to the maximum experimentally achievable resolution in optical systems. There are currently several instances  and many different approaches to SR in imaging, and we suggest the reader to revise the exciting applications of optical super-resolution (e.g.  \\cite{Park2003} and references within). \nIn an analogous manner as in optics, in any type of optical spectroscopy, the spectral resolution is limited \nby the linewidth of the light source and quantified by the minimum separation in wavelength required to \nset clearly apart two transitions. This has been traditionally considered the ultimate limit of \nresolution in spectroscopy.  \nSince the applications of SR techniques to spectroscopy are scarce and not widespread in the experimental community, we will give a basic introduction in the context of the optogalvanic spectroscopy.   \n\nLet us denote by $y$ a one dimensional  acquired signal as obtained from a source $x$ through \nan optical or measurement device. In our particular case $y$ corresponds to the optogalvanic \nsignal as measured and $x$ corresponds to the original spectrum as produced by the physical  \ninteraction of the laser with the plasmas. Assume, as it happens in our optogalvanic case, that \nthe values of $y$ and $x$  both depend on the wavelength $\\lambda$.

This \nimportant difference, combined with the unboundedness of the $\\nu_\\text{hi}$  \nand the separated point source nature of the source signal explain, \nwhy in our case, the improvement in resolution seems to be independent of the finite \nsampling step size (see Figure~\\ref{fig_filter}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{Figure1.eps}\n  \\caption{Convolution of a train of point sources with a gaussian filter.

It consist of three main parts, the light source, the discharge and radiation interaction region, and the detection part. The discharges used in this work were created separately using Neon and Argon. \nThe cathodes were made of cooper and we use a planar cathode configuration with a separation between electrodes of $7$ mm. The Argon and Neon used was research grade purity. The vaccum system was made using a Pfeiffer turbomolecular pump of $100$ l/s that allows us to reach a base pressure of $10^{-5}$ Torr and the pressure measurements were made using a MKS baratron manometer type $626$ and a Varian Eyesys mini-BA vacuum gauge. We use a DC power supply $HP6516$ with a voltage range of ($0-3000$) Volts.\\\\ \nTo excitate the plasma we used an Ekspla Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) pumped by a Nd:YAG pulsed laser. For the optogalvanic effect measurements we collect the voltage variations in a balast resistor of $3.9$ KOhm and this voltage was amplified by a SR$280$ Standford Research Systems boxcar averager in order get the best signal to noise ratio. The power of the laser was measured using a Ophir pyroelectric sensor PE$10-$S in order to get power normalized data. These measurements were send to a National Instruments USB$-6009$ Data Acquisition System (DAQ) and collected in a computer using a LabView automatization program.\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figure3.eps}\n  \\caption{Experimental arrangement. L:Plano-Convex lens f$=150$ mm, PE: Pyroelectric sensor, R: ballast resistor $3.9$ kOhms, HV: DC power supply, LT: laser trigger.}\n  \\label{Diagrama}\n\\end{figure}\nThe laser resolution in the visible range reported here was $0.1$ nm and its wavelength was changed in an automated way. For each wavelength we collected several voltage values  and the values reported here are an average of at least 20 of these. \n\n\n\\section{Results and discussion}\n\nThe Argon discharge in figure \\ref{ArgonOGE} was obtained with a step wavelength variation of $0.1$ nm.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figure4.eps}}\n\\caption{Measured Argon optogalvanic spectra at $3.9$ Torr and a current of $1.21$ mA.}\n\\label{ArgonOGE}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor the Neon discharge in figure \\ref{NeonOGE} the wavelength variation was in steps of $0.1$ nm for the ($600-650$)nm wavelength range and $0.2$ nm for the ($650-700$)nm range.\\\\ \n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n   \\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figure5.eps}}\n   \\caption{Measured Neon optogalvanic spectra with a pressure of $3.3$ Torr and a current of $4.08$ mA.}\n  \\label{NeonOGE}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor the filter parameters estimation we used four different wavelengths ranges (windows) for the  Neon \nexperiment and one for the Argon experiment to double check that the main features of the filter \nwere the same for both experiments.\nThe high resolution experimental data signal used to calculate the filter parameters corresponded \nto the transitions reported in the NIST atomic database for Neon\\cite{NIST}. This was used as the \nknow source signal $x_\\text{know}$. The windows were chosen in such a way that \nsome clearly defined peaks of the source signal $x_\\text{know}$ were contained inside a single peak in the measured signal $y_\\text{fit}$. In table~\\ref{table} we show the Neon windows considered, the values of the cutoff wavenumber $\\nu_c$ and filter parameter $a$. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{  c | c | c }\n    \\hline\n     Window(nm)& $\\nu_c\\times10^{8}$ ($cm^{-1}$) & a $\\times10^{8}$ ($cm^{-1}$)\\\\ \\hline\n     $608.5-610.5$ & $14.0$ & $6.85$ \\\\ \n     $620.0-623.0$ & $14.7$ & $6.98$ \\\\ \n     $625.0-628.0$ & $14.3$ & $6.80$ \\\\ \n     $632.0-634.5$ & $14.5$ & $6.82$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \t\\caption[Table]{Filter parameter estimation with Neon data.}\n\t\\label{table}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe mean values for this experiment are $a=6.87\\times 10^{8} cm^{-1}$ and \n$\\nu_c=14.37\\times10^{8} cm^{-1}$.  For Argon the considered window  was $414.5-417.5$ nm \nand the obtained parameters are $a=6.70\\times 10^{8} cm^{-1}$ and $\\nu_c=14.7\\times 10^{8} cm^{-1}$, \nthese values are with in 2\\% and 5\\% correspondence with the Neon mean values, respectively. \nAs explained in the previous sections, the resolution of the estimated signal $x_\\text{est}$ is \ngiven by $\\nu_\\text{hi}=1/\\lambda_\\text{hi}$, and the SR algorithm does not prescribe any \nbound on $\\nu_\\text{hi}$ (or on the smallness of $\\lambda_\\text{hi}$), therefore in principle \nit can be choose at will. In practice, this is not possible due to the signal to noise ratio and the\nnumerical stability in the solution of \\eqref{discrete}. The latter problem is a consequence of the \nfact that  for small $\\lambda_\\text{hi}$ it is necessary to solve a large linear system of $\\sim \n1/\\lambda_\\text{hi}$ equation that may be numerical ill conditioned. \nThe numerical scheme of the SR algorithm and the adjustment of the filter parameters was \nperformed as follows: First, all signals, $x_\\text{know}, y_\\text{fit}$ and $y$, were linearly \ninterpolated on to a fix grid equally spaced of step size $\\lambda_\\text{hi}= 10^{-4}$ nm, \nwhich yields $\\nu_\\text{hi}= 10^{12}$ cm$^{-1}$. Second, the filter parameters were estimated \nby the above procedure, and third, the minimum in problem \\eqref{discrete} was found to obtain $x_\\text{est}$. \nThere is a final consideration to be made regarding a source of error that originates \nfrom the experimental offset in the measured intensity of the peaks produced by the boxcar amplifier. \nThis error is assimilated in the model of the noise \nterm  $w$ in \\eqref{conv} as an additive constant. By adjusting this offset, by means of another additive \nconstant, the performance of the SR algorithm improves dramatically. In the presented experiments this \nvalue was set to lowered the signal by $1.6$ \\% with respect to the highest peak (near $420$ nm). \nThe numerical implementation was based in the useful Matlab code from \\cite{CandesRombergl1magic}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n   \\centerline{\\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figure6.eps}}\n  \\caption{Experimental Argon optogalvanic spectra and Argon SR results. The spectral resolution improvement allow to resolve some prior experimental indistinguishable peaks.}\n  \\label{ArgonVsSR}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn the figure \\ref{ArgonVsSR} we show a comparison between the Argon optogalvanic spectra before and after applying the SR algorithm. The peaks in the region $419-421$ nm \npreviously unresolved are now distinguishable due to the SR algorithm. The physical reality of these separated peaks was verified by comparing the data obtained by the SR algorithm applied to our Ar data with that reported in NIST atomic line data reference. The difference in position \nbetween these values was a remarkable $0.01$ nm.  \nThe improvement in resolution, in terms of the cutoff frequencies, was extended from \n$\\nu_c= 14.37 \\times 10^8$ cm$^{-1}$ to  $\\nu_\\text{hi}= 10^{12}$ cm$^{-1}$, that is about \n3 orders of magnitude  or in terms of the super-resolution factor $SRF$ about $70$ times. In practical purposes this implies that the linewidth of a peak is reduced about $70$ times as compared to the original measured peaks.\nThis means, equivalently,  a percentage improvement of the signal (PEIS) of $98.5 \\%$. \n As a final remark, is important to emphasize that the reason why the peaks in the \nregion $419-421$ nm can be good resolved by the SR algorithm is because, the distance \n$\\Delta$ between these peaks is about $0.3$ nm  and $2/\\nu_c=1.4 \\times 10^{-2}$ nm. \nTherefore the minimal separation condition \\eqref{minsep} holds and the hypothesis of the \nSR theorem~\\cite{Candes2}  are satisfied.  Hence, up to the noise to signal ratio, \nthe obtained estimate of the peak locations of the source signal is exact.\\\\\nWe showed in this work that dramatic results in resolution improvement for optogalvanic spectroscopy data in Argon using a Super-resolution algorithm. \nThe results shows an improvement in the resolution of the experimentally obtained data by a factor of $70$. The physical reality of the unraveled structure was checked \nby comparing the super-resolved spectrum with atomic transitions reported in the NIST data base. \nWe point out that, the identification of the appropriate filter $G$ that models accurately the experiment and the estimation of its parameters are two of the main issues to be address in order to correctly use of SR algorithms. \nWe believe that SR algorithm could have a major impact on the analysis of experimental spectroscopic data. This is because it makes possible to obtaining high resolution spectral features without resorting to expensive and sophisticated experimental infrastructure. \n\n\\acknowledgments\nThis project was supported by CONACYT CB$2011-167631$ by and by PAPIIT DGAPA UNAM IN $106213$.

Note that it is convenient to write $G$ in terms of its \nFourier transform since in this case it is a diagonal operator (recalling that the Fourier \ntransform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian). That remains is simply to estimate the \nparameters $\\nu_c$, $a$ and $B$ that models the experiment. Notice that $\\nu_c$ is \nthe cut-off frequency and it is important since it represents the frequency (in Fourier or reciprocal \n space) where the noise to signal ratio is small enough to consider the signal consisting of pure noise. \n\nIn order to estimate the filter, we propose here a simple but effective approach:\n given the above functional form for the filter, we proceeded to obtain the filter parameters from high resolution \nexperimental data $x_\\text{know}$ from a gas species, in our case, Neon optical transitions as reported by NIST \\cite{NIST} and the corresponding spectrum as measured by our apparatus $y_\\text{fit}$.\nThis is performed simply by first computing Fourier transform of the measured spectrum and the NIST \nreference spectrum. Second, since in Fourier space the action of filter is multiplicative\n (see \\eqref{reciprocal}), the filter can be obtained as the quotient of the  above quantities.
