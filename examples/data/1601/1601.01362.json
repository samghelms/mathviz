We found that $T_c$ \n    \tdecreases continuously as the potential barrier height increases, becoming inversely \n    \tproportional to the square root of the barrier height when it is large enough. This \n    \tbehavior is {\\it universal} as it is independent of the width and spacing of the barriers. \n    \tThe specific heat at constant volume shows a crossover from 3D to 2D when the height of the \n    \tpotential or the barrier width increase, in addition to the well known peak related to the\n    \tBose-Einstein condensation. These features are due to the trapping of the bosons by the \n    \tpotential barriers, and can be characterized by the energy difference between the energy \n    \tbands below the potential height.\n\n    \t\\keywords{Bose gas \\and multi-slabs \\and critical temperature}\n    \t\n    \t\n    \\end{abstract}\n\n\n    \\section{Introduction}\n\n    Quantum fluids within periodic structures have been subject of study from some decades ago.\n    Important examples of this kind of systems are electron gas in layered cuprate superconductors \\cite{cuprate},\n    cold atomic gases in periodic structures constructed from laser beams known as optical lattices \n    \\cite{opticallattice}, the well known liquid helium four or three in any dimension \\cite{helium},\n    electons or holes in semiconductor superlattices \\cite{superlattice} or Cooper pairs in tube bundle superconductors\n    \\cite{tubebundle}.

In the Fig.~\\ref{fig:cv-contour_u0-100_r-1} this is shown with white \n    circles.

It is noticeable that, to reproduce \n    the maximum at lower temperature with expression (\\ref{eq:crossover-t-edge}) we always use \n    $\\Delta{\\bar{\\varepsilon}_z}$ approximately to $1/4$ of the width of the first energy band of the spectrum, \n    i.e., in this case $\\Delta{\\bar{\\varepsilon}_z}$ value is potential strength independent.\n    \n    \n\n    \\section{Conclusions}\n\n    In summary, we analyzed the behavior of the BEC critical temperature of an IBG confined by an \n    infinite stack of slabs as well as the effects of the external periodic potential on the \n    dimensional crossover, the specific heat maximum positions and their relation with the \n    distribution of allowed and forbidden bands in the energy spectrum. We found that the critical \n    temperature ${T_c}$ decreases continuously as the potential barrier height increases, and it \n    becomes proportional to ${\\tilde{u}_0}^{-1/2}$ when ${\\tilde{u}_0}$ is much larger than \n    $[{({a+b}})/{\\lambda_0}]^{-2}$. It is found that this behavior is {\\it universal} as it does not \n    depends on the potential period, the barrier width nor the barrier separation. In addition, we \n    found that as the period increases the ${T_c}$ becomes a constant  value given by \n    Eq.~\\eqref{eq:tc-limit-behavior} which is spatial period independent. On the other hand, the \n    specific heat at constant volume shows a dimensional crossover within a certain interval of \n    temperatures where it behaves like a 2D gas due to the trapping by the potential barriers. The \n    region where the dimensional crossover occurs as well as the specific heat maximum positions \n    depend directly on the forbidden and allowed bands distribution in the energy spectrum. We were \n    able to find a relation between the maximum positions and characteristic energies of the energy \n    spectrum. Although the specific heat maximum position, at higher temperature, is reproduced \n    using the Eq.~\\eqref{eq:crossover-t-edge} with $\\Delta{\\bar{\\varepsilon}_z}$ the energy difference between the \n    bottom edges of the second and first bands, or, depending on the potential strength, the \n    difference between the bottom edges of the third and first, the bottom edges of the fourth and \n    first  and so on, we highlight that the specific heat maximum position at the lower temperature \n    is reproduced using the Eq.~\\eqref{eq:crossover-t-edge} with $\\Delta{\\bar{\\varepsilon}_z}$ being potential \n    strength independent and equal to $1/4$ of the width of the first band. \n \n    \\vspace{0.30cm}\n\n    \\noindent {\\bf Acknowledgements.}\n    We acknowledge partial support from grants PAPIIT-DGAPA-UNAM IN-105011 and IN-111613,\n    CONACyT 221030 and PAEP UNAM.\n\n\n    \\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n        \\bibitem{cuprate} J.
