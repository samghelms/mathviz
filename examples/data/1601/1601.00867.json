There are\nat present 35 such stars known to have rotation periods ${P_{\\rm rot}}$ longer\nthan a month (30 days). There is no doubt  that these slow rotators\nrepresent a significant fraction, of the order of several percent, of\nthe total population of Ap stars. There are also strong indications\nthat the longest periods must reach of the order of 300 years, and\neven much higher values -- 1000 years  -- seem plausible\n\\citep{2015ASPC..494....3M}. \n\nAt the other end of the distribution, the fastest rotating Ap stars\nhave periods of about 0.5~day\n\\citep[e.g.][]{2002BaltA..11..475A,2004IAUS..215..270M}. The 5 to 6\norders of magnitude spanned by their rotation periods make \nthe Ap stars unique on the main sequence. The evolutionary changes of\nthe rotation periods of Ap stars during their main-sequence lifetimes\nare small,  a factor 2 at most\n\\citep{2006A&A...450..763K,2007AN....328..475H}. Thus period\ndifferentiation must have been completed before Ap stars reach the\nmain sequence. How this can be achieved in the early stages of\nthe evolution of stars within a quite limited range of masses ($\\sim$1.8 to $\\sim$3.0~$M_\\odot$) represents a major theoretical\nchallenge. The mystery of the very long rotation periods is not\nprimarily one of angular momentum since almost all angular momentum\nis already gone at modest periods (10 days). A magnetic stellar\nwind can in principle spin a star down indefinitely, but at long\nperiods it becomes very inefficient. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Mean magnetic field modulus measurements.}\n\\label{tab:modulus}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{crcl}\n\\hline\\hline\\[-4pt]\nHJD&\\multicolumn{1}{c}{${\\langle B\\rangle}$ (G)}&Observatory&Remarks\\[4pt]\n\\hline\\[-4pt]\n2448166.570&3318&OHP&\\\\\n2448636.341&4415&OHP&\\\\\n2448930.638&3633&OHP&\\\\\n2449286.660&$\\la2600$&OHP&unresolved\\\\ \n2449405.373&$\\la2600$&OHP&unresolved\\\\ \n2449729.883&4014&CFHT&\\\\\n2450055.010&4203&CFHT&\\\\\n2450295.588&3278&OHP&\\\\\n2450346.897&2884&KPNO&\\\\\n2450349.936&3146&KPNO&\\\\\n2450797.471&2682&OHP&\\[4pt]\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nIn the absence of clear theoretical ideas, progress continues to\ndepend on observational clues; one   limitation \narises from the fact that the timebase over which observations have\nbeen obtained for many of the most slowly rotating stars is still\nshorter than their periods. Accordingly, only lower limits of those\nperiods are available to date, and the incomplete phase coverage of the\nmagnetic data prevents the strengths and the geometrical structures of\nthe fields from being fully characterised.\n\nThe most famous example of this situation is $\\gamma$~Equ\n(=~HD~201601). The first determinations of its mean longitudinal\nmagnetic field ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ were achieved in 1946 by\n\\citet{1958ApJS....3..141B}. Since then, many additional measurements\nof that field moment have been obtained by a large number of different\ngroups \\citep[see][and references\ntherein]{2006MNRAS.365..585B,2015ASPC..494..100B}. They provide a\nnearly continuous coverage of the ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ variations over almost 70\nyears, but still fall very short of completing a full cycle as the\nrotation period is most likely around 100 years.\n\nMost other very slowly rotating Ap stars have been monitored over much\nshorter timespans. While prior to this study 16 were known (to us) to\nhave rotation periods longer than 1000 days,  only for 4 of them had\nobservations been obtained over more than one cycle and \nthe exact value of the period been derived: HD~9996\n\\citep[${P_{\\rm rot}}=7937$\\,d,][]{2014AstBu..69..315M}, HD~59435\n\\citep[${P_{\\rm rot}}=1360$\\,d,][]{1999A&A...347..164W}, \nHD~94660 \\citep[${P_{\\rm rot}}=2800$\\,d, Mathys, in preparation; see\nalso][]{1993ASPC...44..547H}, \nand HD~187474 \\citep[${P_{\\rm rot}}=2345$\\,d,][]{1991A&AS...89..121M}. Only\nlower limits were \navailable for all the others, ranging from $\\sim$4.5 to $\\sim$100 years. \n\nHere we report the determination of one more period longer than 1000\ndays, for the star HD~18078.\n\nHD~18078 (=~BD~+55~726) is an A0p SrCr star\n\\citep{2009A&A...498..961R}. On account of its low ${v\\,\\sin i}$, it was\nincluded by \\citet{1970PASP...82..878P} in a list of 25 stars that\nmight have long periods, which also featured  several of the\nabove-mentioned slowly rotating stars (HD~9996, HD~110066, HD~187474,\nand HD~201601). \\citet{1971ApJ...164..309P} inferred from\nconsideration of differential broadening of spectral lines of\ndifferent magnetic sensitivities that HD~18078 had a magnetic field of\nthe order of 3.8~kG. Photometric observations by\n\\cite{1973PASP...85..141W} suggested that its period must\nbe longer than one year. Following the observation of lines resolved\ninto their Zeeman components in its spectrum\n\\citep{1992A&A...256..169M}, HD~18078 was included in the programme of\nsystematic study of Ap stars with magnetically resolved lines that was\nled by one of our team (GM).  Its mean magnetic field modulus was found to\nshow large variations, but the number of measurements obtained by 1995\nwas not sufficient to determine the stellar rotation period\n\\citep{1997A&AS..123..353M}.  \n\nWe present additional determinations of that field moment in\nSect.~\\ref{sec:magnetic}, and combine them with measurements of the\nmean longitudinal magnetic field to derive an unambiguous value for\nthe rotation period. We show in Sect.~\\ref{sec:photom} that this value\nis consistent with observations of the photometric\nvariations. Finally, in Sect.~\\ref{sec:discussion}, we present a\nsimple model of the unusual structure of the magnetic field of\nHD~18078. \n\n\\section{Magnetic variations}\n\\label{sec:magnetic}\n\\subsection{Mean magnetic field modulus}\n\\label{sec:modulus}\nHigh-resolution ($R=\\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda\\simeq7\\,10^4$--$1.2\\,10^5$)\nspectra of HD~18078 were recorded in natural light on 11 different\nnights between  October 1990 and December 1997, using the AURELIE\nspectrograph on the 1.52\\,m telescope of Observatoire de\nHaute-Provence, the Gecko spectrograph on the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope, and the coud\\'e spectrograph with the 0.9\\,m coud\\'e feed\ntelescope of Kitt Peak National Observatory.

The reason is unknown, so that we cannot\nknow if HD~18078 is affected by that systematic error. However,  its\nmagnitude does not significantly exceed 160~G for any known case: not\nonly it is of the same order as the estimated ${\\langle B\\rangle}$ measurement\nuncertainties for HD~18078, but it is also  quite small with respect to\nthe amplitude of the field modulus variations in that\nstar. Accordingly, we do not expect it to have a significant impact on\nthe analysis performed in this paper. We note in particular that the\nrotation period of the star, as determined in Sect.~\\ref{sec:period}, is\nprimarily constrained by the mean longitudinal magnetic field\ndata, and that all field modulus values, including those derived from\nAURELIE observations, define a smooth variation curve when plotted\nagainst the phases that are computed for that value of the period.\n\n\\subsection{Mean longitudinal magnetic field}\n\\label{sec:long}\nThe Main Stellar Spectrograph of the 6\\,m telescope BTA of the Special\nAstrophysical Observatory was used to record medium-resolution\n($R\\simeq14\\,500$) spectra of HD~18078 on 25 nights  from March\n1999 to March 2007.

In contrast, the ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$\nvariation curve very significantly departs from a single sinusoid. This is quite\nunusual. While some anharmonicity of the ${\\langle B\\rangle}$ variations is\nobserved rather frequently, for more than 90\\%\\ of the Ap stars with resolved\nlines for which the ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ variations have been characterised, these\nvariations do not show any significant departure from harmonicity. In\nthe few cases when such departures occur, the field modulus variations\nare also anharmonic. Thus HD~18078 is  unique in showing\nanharmonic variations of the longitudinal field but not of the field\nmodulus. \n\nFurthermore, HD~18078 also shows a large shift (0.17) between the\nphase of the negative extremum of ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ and the phase of maximum\n${\\langle B\\rangle}$. Again, this is exceptional; in most Ap stars with magnetically\nresolved lines, both curves are either almost exactly in phase or\nalmost exactly in antiphase. \n\nWe return to these anomalies in Sect.~\\ref{sec:discussion}.\n\n\n\\section{Photometric variations}\n\\label{sec:photom}\nStr\\\"omgren four-colour measurements of HD~18078 were obtained using\nthe Four College Automatic Photometric Telescope (FCAPT) from 1995\nthrough 2004 as part of a programme to find and improve the periods of\n magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars.  The comparison star was\nHD~18460 and the  check star was HD~17429.  The comparison and check stars\nare near the variable on the sky and have similar $V$ magnitudes and $B-V$\ncolors.  They were chosen from presumably non-variable stars according\nto Hipparcos photometry \\citep{1997ESASP1200.....E}. The FCAPT first\nmeasures the dark \ncount and then in each filter sky-ch-c-v-c-v-c-v-c-ch-sky for each\ngroup of variable (v), check (ch), and comparison (c) stars, where sky\nis a reading of the sky.  \n\nThe FCAPT operated from 1990 through\n2013. It is an automated telescope without an on-site observer,\nthus the users have to be especially careful about which data to keep.\nData from groups that were not completely observed were not\nanalysed. In a group, if any of the standard deviations of the\ndifferences between the comparison and check stars exceeded 2\\% of the\naverage values, we \nexcluded all the observations of the affected group  following\n\\citet{1988ApJS...67..439S}.  Light curve inspections still showed some\nobvious outliers.  Then we compared the difference between the value\nof an apparent outlier and the value of the fit at a given phase to\nthe standard deviation of the fit.  Any points more than 3 standard\ndeviations from the fit in any filter were removed from the data sets\nof all filters.There were only three such outliers, two of which were only\ndiscrepant in the $u$ and $v$ filters, that were not used in the\nperiodograms. For the third, the values in $b$ and $y$ were just\nabove the threshold for discarding data. Including these points in the\nphase diagrams clearly shows that they would not change the results\nfrom the periodograms.\n\nThe photometric data are in Table~3, available at the\nCDS, which contains the following information. Column~1 lists the\nheliocentric Julian Date, Cols.~2 through 9 give the variable$-$comparison magnitude (${\\rm v}-{\\rm c}$) and comparison$-$check\n(${\\rm c}-{\\rm ch}$) magnitude\nfor the $uvby$ filters, respectively. \n\nThe $uvby$ phase coverage of HD~18078 is limited but the variations are\nconsistent with the period of 1358 days determined from the magnetic\nmeasurements (Fig.~\\ref{fig:uvby}).  We used the Scargle periodogram\n\\citep{1982ApJ...263..835S,1986ApJ...302..757H} to search for periodic\nvariations in the $uvby$ \ndata; one of the peaks was near 1400 days.  Although the 1995--96 and\n2003--04 FCAPT data are better aligned if a period of 1405 days is\nused, the ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ data, which were obtained over three cycles of\nvariation, show systematic shifts between consecutive cycles  when\nplotted with the \nlonger period and are better matched with the 1358-day period.  The\nother peaks we found were for periods of 292 days and 1639 days,\nneither of which is fit by the magnetic data. \n\nAlthough the phases of the photometric extrema are uncertain because\nof incomplete coverage, they definitely appear shifted with\nrespect to those of the mean magnetic field modulus. Most likely,\nbrightness minimum (in all four Str\\\"omgren bands) occurs close to the\nnegative ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ extremum, and brightness maximum close to the \npositive ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ extremum, which is shallower. This suggests that the brightness\ndistribution over the stellar surface may to first order be symmetric\nabout the magnetic axis, and show a monotonic gradient from the darker \nnegative magnetic pole to the brighter positive pole. \n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\nBesides the significance of the addition of a fifth star to the group\nof Ap stars with exactly known rotation periods longer than 1000 days,\nHD~18078 proves to be a particularly interesting object because of\nthe unusual structure of its magnetic field. This shows through\nin a number of different ways: the magnetically split components of\nthe {Fe~{\\sc ii}~$\\lambda\\,6149.2$}\\ line are exceptionally broad; the variation curve of the\nmean longitudinal magnetic field is strongly anharmonic, while that of\nthe mean magnetic field modulus does not show any significant\ndeparture from a sinusoid; and the phase difference between these two\ncurves is closer to quadrature than to phase coincidence or \nanti-coincidence. In all these respects, the behaviour of HD~18078\nis significantly different from that of the vast majority of the Ap stars\nwith magnetically resolved lines. \n\nIn particular, the considerable phase shift between the ${\\langle B\\rangle}$ and\n${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ variation curves implies that the magnetic field cannot be\nsymmetric about an axis passing through the centre of the star. Thus,\nit cannot be approximated by a simple symmetric model such as\nsuccessfully used by \\citet{2000A&A...359..213L} for a statistical\nsample of Ap stars with magnetically resolved lines. However, the\ncurves of variation of ${\\langle B\\rangle}$ and ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$ look separately \nrather like those of stars which can be described by the simple\ncentred, colinear multipole model used in that work. We consider\nwhether we can find a simple modification of that class of models that\nreproduces at least the qualitative features of the data on HD~18078. \n\nWe start from the view that the approximately sinusoidal variation of\n${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$, and the modest ratio ${\\langle B\\rangle}/{\\langle B_z\\rangle} \\sim 3$, both suggest that there\nis an important component of the field that is roughly dipolar. The\nfailure of the global dipolar topology for this star appears to be due\nto a stronger field in the hemisphere that is coming into view as the\nnegative pole rotates out of sight behind the star and the positive pole\nrotates into sight, compared to the weaker field that comes into view\nas the positive pole of the dipole recedes behind the star. Thus, we\ncould consider a perturbed colinear multipole model in which the field\nin one hemisphere is made weaker than  in the other hemisphere.\n\nA simple version of this idea can be implemented by considering a\ncoordinate system anchored to the star, with its $z_{\\rm m}$ axis parallel\nto the axis of the unperturbed dipole, the $x_{\\rm m}$ axis in the plane of\nthe stellar rotation axis and the unperturbed dipole, and the $y_{\\rm m}$\naxis perpendicular to the plane of the rotation axis and the\nunperturbed dipole axis. It is clear that we need a perturbation in\nthe $y_{\\rm m}$ direction, with regions of $y_{\\rm m}>0$ perturbed in the\nopposite sense to regions with $y_{\\rm m}<0$. Within the programmes that\nwe use for computations of the field predicted by the centred colinear\nmultipole model, a perturbation of this form is very easy to\nimplement. One of the simplest   is to modify the\nequations of the dipole, quadrupole, etc., in such a way that the field\non the surface of the star with a particular $y_{\\rm m}$ coordinate is\nincreased or decreased by a factor $1+A\\,y_{\\rm m}$. Since we take the\nmagnetic coordinates to be normalised to the star radius, we consider\n$|A|<1$.\n\nA few experiments showed that a value of $A\\approx0.4$\ntogether with suitable polar strengths for the unperturbed dipole,\nquadrupole, and octupole (which the modelling programme tries to\noptimise for a good fit to the observations) is capable of reproducing\nqualitatively the most extraordinary feature of the ${\\langle B\\rangle}$ and ${\\langle B_z\\rangle}$\ncurves, namely the large phase shift between the extrema of the two\ncurves, and--at least approximately--also fits the shapes of both\ncurves (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:magnetic}). This supports the qualitative\ndiscussion above and validates \nthe idea that the main perturbation on the simple multipolar model\nthat is needed to describe the observations is to make the field in\none hemisphere of the star (with $y_{\\rm m} >0$) stronger and the\nfield in the other hemisphere ($y_{\\rm m}<0$) weaker. \n\nClearly it will be possible to map this behaviour in more detail\n\\citep[e.g.][]{2015MNRAS.453.2163S} when\nsuitable observational material (polarised spectra in all four Stokes\nparameters, distributed over the full rotation cycle) becomes\navailable. Of course, the very small value of ${v\\,\\sin i}$ means that\nHD~18078 is not remarkably suitable for mapping as there is no\nvelocity resolution across the disk, so such a map will probably lack\ndetail. Nevertheless, we expect that it will qualitatively reflect the\nhemispheric asymmetry that we have identified. \n\nAs time passes and data covering a full rotation cycle become\navailable for an increasing number of Ap stars with periods of  several years, it will be interesting to find out if the kind\nof asymmetric magnetic field structure found in HD~18078 is more\nlikely to occur in extremely slowly rotating stars than in shorter period\nones, or if the conjunction of such a structure and very slow rotation\nin HD~18078 is purely coincidental. \n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nIIR and DOK are grateful to the Russian Scientific Foundation\nfor partial financial support of the observations with the 6\\,m telescope\nand data reduction (RSF grant 14-50-00043). \n\\end{acknowledgements}\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{aa}\n\\bibliography{hd18078_rev2}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 19432, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\rm R}$ (resp. $\\lambda_{\\rm L}$) is the wavelength of\nthe centre of gravity of the line in right (resp. left) circular\npolarisation and $\\bar g$ is the effective Land\\'e factor of the\ntransition.

This analysis unambiguously\nindicated that ${P_{\\rm rot}}=1358$\\,d. In particular, shorter periods are\ndefinitely ruled out. The uncertainty of the derived period was\nestimated by varying it between 1338\\,d and 1378\\,d, and by plotting for each\ntrial a phase diagram of the longitudinal field, in which different\nsymbols were used to represent the measurements corresponding to\ndifferent cycles (three of them in total). In this way, we were able\nto determine \nwhen a significant systematic phase shift started to appear\nfrom one cycle to the next, indicative of a value of the period that\nis either too large or too small.
