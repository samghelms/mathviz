The infinite sequence of Zeno's paradox gets mapped to the effect of infinite gravitational red-shift near event horizon and the infinite amount of co-ordinate time the light/particle takes to reach the horizon, starting from a finite distance away from the horizon.

But the subjects are covered in very different fashion. Even at early stages of College Physics courses the Special theory is presented with care, its foundational principles clearly stated, their mathematical form given, the physical implications elucidated and often the conceptual intricacies explored by considering and resolving various paradoxes. \\cite{introductory text 0}  By contrast, it is common to mention the General theory only, at best, in two places:  \\cite{inverno}  (i)  in the context of the equivalence principle as it pertains the puzzling equality of the inertial and gravitational masses, appearing in Newton's second law of motion and Newton's theory of gravitation, and (ii) in the context of corpuscular theory of light, the fact that in the General theory there is an associated escape velocity from an astrophysical object for these corpuscules,  is mentioned as a quick peek into the nature of Black holes.Students are left wanting for more specific and better explanations of the content of the General theory, but they are told the mathematics are very involved and best left for a later stage in their education. \\\\\n\nIn this paper we seek for a middle ground.  We attempt to introduce some of the subtleties associated with General Relativity (GR) without necessarily delving into the full machinery of differential geometry. We believe some  fascinating GR stories can be told and explained through carefully chosen analogues from elsewhere in Physics. This can both further whet the early student's appetite for further learning GR and present an opportunity to use various tools from mathematics and physics in a challenging and attractive context.  We present here one such example, an analogy between Zeno's paradox and that of a body falling into a black hole as seen by a falling and a distant observers. \n\nZeno's Dichotomy paradox \\cite{Field} is presumably well known to students.  To reach his destination, Bob must travel a distance $d$ and he first travels half of it, that is, a distance of  $\\frac{d}{2}$.  Then, to travel the remaining distance, $\\frac{d}{2}$, he again travels half of it, that is $\\frac{d}{4}$. Having traveled a distance of $\\frac{3d}{4}$, he next travels half of the remaining distance, or $\\frac{d}{8}$. And so on:   at each subsequent ``step'' Bob travels half the remaining distance. Since there is always some distance left to travel,  we must conclude Bob never reaches his destination. This breaking of the trip into artificial steps is arbitrary, but certainly possible and completely general. On the other hand, any beginning physics student knows that  if Bob is traveling with constant velocity $v$, it takes him a time of $\\frac{d}{v}$ to reach his destination. This is clearly a finite time, hence Bob indeed reaches his destination. The solution to Zeno's paradox lies in how we reconcile the fact that Bob has to take infinite number of steps to perform the task with the fact Bob takes a finite amount of time to complete it. \n\nThe notion of event horizon of a black hole is probably less familiar. One can introduce it using only familiar concepts from classical mechanics; although not quite correct,  the derivation does give the right answer and more importantly introduces the correct concepts. Students know that the escape velocity $v_{\\rm esc}$ from a spherical ``planet'' of mass $M$ and radius $r$ is given by \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:vescape}\nv_{\\rm esc}^2=\\frac{2G_NM}{r}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"v_{\\rm esc}^{2}=\\frac{2G_{N}M}{r}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>esc</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mi>r</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03956.tex", "nexttext": "\nSince the speed of light is the maximum speed attainable, any object {\\it closer} to the center of the ``planet'' than $R$ will not escape.

Anyone  (technically, ``observer'') that chooses to set her clock to tick according to Bob's steps will record that an infinite amount of time will have to pass in reaching Bob's destination. \n\nLet's cast this in way that is suitable to build up the Zeno-Gravity correspondence. Let us suppose our robot, Bob,  starts a distance  $r=4$ from a center of a ``planet''  and moves radially with a unit radial velocity ($\\frac{dr}{d\\tau}=-1$) towards the center at $r=0$. Moreover, suppose Bob's goal is to reach the spherical shell at $r=2$.  This shell can be taken to be a real object, a wall,  {\\it e.g.}, the surface of the spherical planet.

The radial null\ngeodesic will be described by $r(t)$ that  takes infinite time to\nreach the horizon starting from some point outside the horizon. The\nradial null geodesic can be sampled uniformly with each internal unit\nbeing  a ``step.'' From there we can easily construct the robot's\nmotion  and we can construct a summable sequence $\\left\\{a\\right\\}_{n}$\nsuch that $A-r(n)= \\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}$.\\\\\n\nOne can easily produce from this exercises for the students. If one\naims at closed form solutions, one must take care to find functional\nforms of $g(t)$ that makes the inversion, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:invert},\nposible. A very simple example is $g(t)=\\exp(t)$ (and it is very\nclosely related to Zeno's paradox discussed in the previous\nsections). One may also start from the function $f(r)$, and then again a\nclosed form solution may require careful attention to this choice.\nIn this class of examples is the actual Black Hole metric. A good exercise for the students is to work out the sequence corresponding to the Schwarzschild metric,\\cite{hawking} given by\n\n", "index": 51, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{metricS}\nds^{2}=\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{r}\\right)dt^{2}-\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}dr^{2}-r^{2}d^2\\Omega_{2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E26.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"ds^{2}=\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{r}\\right)dt^{2}-\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}dr^{2%&#10;}-r^{2}d^{2}\\Omega_{2}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mi>r</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mi>r</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>d</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
