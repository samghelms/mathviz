In order to test the robustness of results obtained under these approximations, it is desirable to check them against some other \\emph{ab initio} formulation of the theory. For a generic NC~QFT, a possible way to do this is by numerical evaluation of correlation functions, in a Feynman path-integral formulation of the theory~\\cite{Feynman:1948ur}. During the past fifteen years, this approach has been successfully pursued in several works, in which various types of field theories in non-commutative spaces of different dimensions have been mapped to appropriately defined finite-dimensional matrix models, and investigated by Monte~Carlo integration. More recently, the numerical technology developed in these works has also found applications in computer simulations of dimensionally reduced supersymmetric theories, paving the way to the non-perturbative study of many open theoretical issues---including, in particular, problems related to the gauge/gravity duality~\\cite{Maldacena:1997re, Gubser:1998bc, Witten:1998qj}.\n\n\\section{Implementation}\n\\label{sec:implementation}\n\nIn the Feynman path-integral formalism, expectation values in a generic QFT (defined in ordinary, commutative Minkowski spacetime) are given by\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{Minkowskian_Feynman_path_integral}\n\\langle \\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}_1 \\dots \\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}_n \\rangle = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D} \\phi \\; \\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}_1 \\dots \\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}_n \\exp \\left( i S^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}} \\right)}{\\int \\mathcal{D} \\phi \\; \\exp \\left( i S^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}} \\right)}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\langle\\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}_{1}\\dots\\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}%&#10;_{n}\\rangle=\\frac{\\int\\mathcal{D}\\phi\\;\\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}_{1}%&#10;\\dots\\mathcal{O}^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}_{n}\\exp\\left(iS^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}\\right%&#10;)}{\\int\\mathcal{D}\\phi\\;\\exp\\left(iS^{\\mbox{\\tiny{(M)}}}\\right)}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcaa</mi><mn>1</mn><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">(M)</mtext></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcaa</mi><mi>n</mi><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">(M)</mtext></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udc9f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><mi>\u03d5</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcaa</mi><mn>1</mn><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">(M)</mtext></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcaa</mi><mi>n</mi><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">(M)</mtext></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>S</mi><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">(M)</mtext></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udc9f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><mi>\u03d5</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>S</mi><mtext mathsize=\"71%\">(M)</mtext></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01176.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $S$ denotes the Euclidean action, a functional of the fields $\\phi$.

Also this formulation of NC scalar field theory in two dimensions has been studied numerically in various works~\\cite{Ambjorn:2002nj, Bietenholz:2002ev, Mejia-Diaz:2014lza}.\n\nBefore moving on to a selection of results from numerical studies of NC~QFT, we conclude this section comparing these types of discretization with the regularization of QFT on a spacetime grid that is performed in lattice field theory~\\cite{Wilson:1974sk}. As it was suggested in the literature~\\cite{Grosse:1995pr, Balachandran:2005ew}, the discretization of NC~QFT in terms of matrix models could provide an interesting and viable alternative to computations based on the lattice regularization (even for theories defined in ordinary, commutative spaces, if the non-commutativity parameter can be made sufficiently small, so that results can be eventually extrapolated to the commutative limit): it is therefore important to assess similarities and differences between the two approaches.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Perhaps the most striking difference with the lattice regularization is that matrix-model discretizations of NC field theories can often be formulated in a way that preserves the spacetime symmetries exactly \\emph{at every value of the cutoff}. A very clear example is provided by the action for the scalar theory on the fuzzy sphere defined in eq.~(\\ref{fuzzy_sphere_action}), which is explicitly invariant under continuum ${\\mathrm{SO}}(3)$ rotations at every value of $N$. By contrast, the lattice breaks the group of Euclidean rotations down to a discrete subgroup---typically, the dihedral (in $D=2$ spacetime dimensions), octahedral (in $D=3$) or hyperoctahedral (in $D=4$) group, if the lattice is a regular square, cubic or hypercubic grid. Similarly, the lattice also breaks the group of continuum translations down to the subgroup of translations by integer multiples of the lattice spacing $a$ in each direction. This implies that, on the lattice, the spacetime symmetries of the continuum theory are explicitly broken by discretization artifacts, and get restored \\emph{only in the continuum limit} $a \\to 0$.\n\\item The treatment of fermionic fields (especially as it concerns chirality and anomalies) is somewhat simpler in matrix-model formulations of NC field theories~\\cite{Grosse:1994ed, Grosse:1995jt, Balachandran:1999qu, Balachandran:2003ay, Dolan:2007uf}, whereas all ultralocal, chirally symmetric lattice formulations of the Dirac operator lead to unphysical doubler modes~\\cite{Nielsen:1980rz, Nielsen:1981xu}, which can be removed at the cost of sacrificing either exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing~\\cite{Wilson:1975hf} or the ultralocality of the Dirac operator~\\cite{Kaplan:1992bt, Narayanan:1994gw, Neuberger:1997fp}.\n\\item Also the construction of supersymmetric models is usually simpler~\\cite{Nishimura:2009xm, Joseph:2015xwa}, while a ``direct'' implementation of supersymmetry on the lattice requires fine-tuning~\\cite{Bergner:2013nwa}, and more sophisticated formulations of lattice supersymmetry, which involve twisted formulations or orbifold constructions, are actually closer to matrix-model formulations of NC field theory~\\cite{Catterall:2009it}.\n\\item The typical computational costs of present NC field theory simulations are not prohibitive.

Also this formulation of NC scalar field theory in two dimensions has been studied numerically in various works~\\cite{Ambjorn:2002nj, Bietenholz:2002ev, Mejia-Diaz:2014lza}.\n\nBefore moving on to a selection of results from numerical studies of NC~QFT, we conclude this section comparing these types of discretization with the regularization of QFT on a spacetime grid that is performed in lattice field theory~\\cite{Wilson:1974sk}. As it was suggested in the literature~\\cite{Grosse:1995pr, Balachandran:2005ew}, the discretization of NC~QFT in terms of matrix models could provide an interesting and viable alternative to computations based on the lattice regularization (even for theories defined in ordinary, commutative spaces, if the non-commutativity parameter can be made sufficiently small, so that results can be eventually extrapolated to the commutative limit): it is therefore important to assess similarities and differences between the two approaches.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Perhaps the most striking difference with the lattice regularization is that matrix-model discretizations of NC field theories can often be formulated in a way that preserves the spacetime symmetries exactly \\emph{at every value of the cutoff}. A very clear example is provided by the action for the scalar theory on the fuzzy sphere defined in eq.~(\\ref{fuzzy_sphere_action}), which is explicitly invariant under continuum ${\\mathrm{SO}}(3)$ rotations at every value of $N$. By contrast, the lattice breaks the group of Euclidean rotations down to a discrete subgroup---typically, the dihedral (in $D=2$ spacetime dimensions), octahedral (in $D=3$) or hyperoctahedral (in $D=4$) group, if the lattice is a regular square, cubic or hypercubic grid. Similarly, the lattice also breaks the group of continuum translations down to the subgroup of translations by integer multiples of the lattice spacing $a$ in each direction. This implies that, on the lattice, the spacetime symmetries of the continuum theory are explicitly broken by discretization artifacts, and get restored \\emph{only in the continuum limit} $a \\to 0$.\n\\item The treatment of fermionic fields (especially as it concerns chirality and anomalies) is somewhat simpler in matrix-model formulations of NC field theories~\\cite{Grosse:1994ed, Grosse:1995jt, Balachandran:1999qu, Balachandran:2003ay, Dolan:2007uf}, whereas all ultralocal, chirally symmetric lattice formulations of the Dirac operator lead to unphysical doubler modes~\\cite{Nielsen:1980rz, Nielsen:1981xu}, which can be removed at the cost of sacrificing either exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing~\\cite{Wilson:1975hf} or the ultralocality of the Dirac operator~\\cite{Kaplan:1992bt, Narayanan:1994gw, Neuberger:1997fp}.\n\\item Also the construction of supersymmetric models is usually simpler~\\cite{Nishimura:2009xm, Joseph:2015xwa}, while a ``direct'' implementation of supersymmetry on the lattice requires fine-tuning~\\cite{Bergner:2013nwa}, and more sophisticated formulations of lattice supersymmetry, which involve twisted formulations or orbifold constructions, are actually closer to matrix-model formulations of NC field theory~\\cite{Catterall:2009it}.\n\\item The typical computational costs of present NC field theory simulations are not prohibitive. Most state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculations, instead, require supercomputing resources. \n\\item The reason for the latter difference is not in intrinsic limitations of the lattice formulation, but rather in the fact that the primary focus of numerical studies of NC models is on \\emph{qualitative} features of theories beyond the Standard Model, typically at energy scales far from the reach of present experiments, whereas lattice calculations are now in a precision era, and aim at accurate \\emph{quantitative} results for QCD phenomenology~\\cite{Kronfeld:2012uk}---while topics beyond QCD (e.g. large-$N$ gauge theories ~\\cite{Panero:2012qx, Lucini:2013qja}, strongly coupled gauge theories for dynamical electro-weak symmetry breaking~\\cite{DelDebbio:2010zz, Giedt:2012it}, et c.) are covered in a sizable, but much smaller, fraction of the lattice literature.\n\\end{itemize} \n\n\\section{Examples of results}\n\\label{sec:results}\n\nIn this section, we review a (limited) selection of results from recent numerical studies of NC models.

Not only can they be used to cross-check exact analytical results, but also (more importantly) to determine the validity range of analytical calculations that involve some form of approximation, or to provide guidance to understand problems which are harder to tackle analytically.\n\nAs we discussed above, typical Monte~Carlo simulations of NC field theories can be successfully performed with modest computational resources, and the studies of this type that several groups have been carrying out during the past few years have led to many interesting results, for various NC theories.\n\nInterestingly, some techniques devised for simulations of NC QFT can also be applied to field theories defined in ordinary, commutative spaces. For certain problems, the numerical implementation of matrix-model regularization methods inspired by NC field theories proves competitive with respect to more conventional (e.g. lattice) approaches: one striking example is provided by the investigation of dimensionally reduced supersymmetric gauge theories, that we briefly reviewed in subsection~\\ref{subsec:results_supersymmetry}.\n\nFinally, it is worthwhile noting that some numerical challenges in Monte~Carlo studies of NC field theories are common to lattice QCD, and any progress toward their solution in one research area could potentially lead to very fruitful developments in the other, too. For example, the authors of refs.~\\cite{Anagnostopoulos:2001yb, Anagnostopoulos:2010ux} devised a novel factorization method to cope with the numerical ``sign problem'' affecting their model: as is well-known, this notorious computational problem also hinders simulations of lattice QCD at finite baryon density~\\cite{deForcrand:2010ys} and of condensed-matter systems~\\cite{Loh:1990sp}.\n\nFor all of these reasons, a closer interaction of the two communities would be highly desirable.\n\n\\acknowledgments\nThe author warmly thanks the organizers of the Humboldt Kolleg \\emph{``Open Problems in Theoretical Physics: The Issue of Quantum Space-Time''} for the invitation to present this review talk, and the Alexander~von~Humboldt-Stiftung/Foundation for financial support.\n\n\\bibliography{paper}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 20626, "prevtext": "\nThe extension to three or four spacetime dimensions can be achieved, by invoking arguments of large-$N$ volume independence~\\cite{Ishiki:2008te}.\n\nThis approach has been successfully pursued in a number of studies~\\cite{Ambjorn:2000bf, Ambjorn:2000dx, Ambjorn:2001xs, Anagnostopoulos:2005cy, Hanada:2007ti, Anagnostopoulos:2007fw, Kawahara:2007eu, Catterall:2008yz, Hanada:2009ne, Hanada:2012si, Anagnostopoulos:2013xga, Hanada:2013rga, Filev:2015hia, Filev:2015cmz}.
