Since the advent of metamaterials, the extraordinary optical transmission has been one of the extensively studied phenomenon this last decade \\cite{ebbesen_extraordinary_1998,baida_light_2002,moreau_light_2003,baida_origin_2004,salvi_annular_2005,poujet_90_2007,baida_enhanced_2010}. Nowadays, extraordinary optical transmission may be used for polarization applications such as anisotropic plates \\cite{baida_enhanced-transmission_2011,dahdah_nanocoaxial_2012} and polarization manipulation \\cite{grady_terahertz_2013,shen_ultra-high-efficiency_2014,pfeiffer_controlling_2014} with higher performances than conventional components used in visible/IR spectral domain. For the terahertz (THz) domain where natural materials don't basically exhibit efficient dichroism property, it is now well-known that linear polarizers are commonly obtained with frequency selective surfaces or with metallic gratings. Some papers proposed to demonstrate the polarizing properties of periodic subwavelength apertures with the use of the well known Malus' Law \\cite{gordon_strong_2004,degiron_optical_2004,sarrazin_polarization_2004,dimaio_polarization-dependent_2006}. However, recent experimental results are clearly in contradiction with the output transmission predicted theoretically by this law when using subwavelength patterned metallic polarizers \\cite{huang_break_2014,Zhang:15}. One explanation given in \\cite{Zhang:15} for this breakthrough involves the reflections between the plates.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{PAM120116.eps}\n\\caption{(a) 3D view of the Polarizer-Analyzer Mounting (PAM) where $d$ is the distance between polarizer and analyzer, $n_i$ is the refractive index of the inner space between the two metallic plates, $t$ is the plate thickness and $\\theta$ is the angular difference between polarizer and analyzer axes. (b) 2D view of the considered subwavelength pattern with $p$, the bi-periodicity, $a_x$ and $a_y$ the rectangle's width and length respectively.}\n\\label{schPAM}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn this paper, we theoretically report an extended Malus' Law for metallic Polarizer-Analyzer Mounting (PAM). For a specific configuration based on multiple reflections inside the PAM, we propose one principle of new ultrasensitive sensors with giant quality factors controlled by the angle between the polarizer axes. Precisely, we study a PAM (as illustrated in fig. \\ref{schPAM}) made of parallel metallic polarizers with biperiodic subwavelength grating where each periodic cell consists in a single rectangular aperture. The angle between polarizer and analyzer axes is denoted $\\theta. $The periods along $x$- and $y$-axes (at $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$) are identical and noted $p$. Each rectangular aperture only supports the fundamental $TE_{01}$ guided mode. For one polarizer, the output linear electric polarization is thus defined along the rectangle width axis for the working wavelength ranges chosen as $\\lambda>\\lambda_{c,TE_{01}}$ where $\\lambda_{c,TE_{01}} = 2a_y >p$ (subwavelength approximation), $\\lambda_{c,TE_{01}}$ being the cut-off wavelength of $TE_{01}$ fundamental guided mode. The higher order modes $TE_{10}$, $TE_{02}$ and above are evanescent ($\\lambda_{c,TE_{10}}$ and $ \\lambda_{c,TE_{02}} < p$).  Metal is assumed to be a perfect electric conductor at THz frequencies. \n\nThe analytical extended Malus' law is deduced from a renewed Jones formalism for metallic polarizers \\cite{boyer_jones_2014,romain2015extended} based on a monomode modal method \\cite{lalanne_one-mode_2000,martin-moreno_theory_2001,baida_enhanced-transmission_2011,boyer_analytical_2012}.

For the sake of completeness, we first give the general expression of the reflection Jones matrix of the $k^{th}$ polarizer oriented along $x$-axis:\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nJ_k^R = \\left (\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\alpha_R - 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta\n\\end{array}\\right )\n\\label{JkRAbs}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"J_{k}^{R}=\\left(\\begin{array}[]{cc}\\alpha_{R}-1&amp;0\\\\&#10;0&amp;\\beta\\end{array}\\right)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>J</mi><mi>k</mi><mi>R</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>R</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mn>0</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mn>0</mn></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mi>\u03b2</mi></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07022.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis equation highlights the discrepancies between the factor $\\alpha_d$ found for commonly used dichroic polarizers and the modulation factor $\\alpha$ previously obtained for metallic polarizer (eqs. \\eqref{eq:alpha} and \\eqref{eq:gamma}).

We focus on the influence of the optical path $L$. The dimensions of the polarizer and analyzer rectangle are: $a_y/p = 0.9$ and $a_x/p = 0.45$. These values are chosen such as the radiative losses of the metallic polarizer's apertures are maximized (spectrally broadband transmission). Besides, the $a_x/p$ value is set to ensure that only the fundamental mode can propagate in apertures at wavelengths located above the Rayleigh anomaly (monomode regime). In other words, the cut-off wavelength of the second cavity mode is smaller than the first Rayleigh wavelength. The thickness of the polarizer and analyzer is set to $t/p = 1$. In this section, we consider that all the homogeneous regions (including the apertures) are filled with air. For all results, we compute the normalized transmission coefficient: $I_{out}/I_{in}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{MLfig1bis110116bis.eps}\n\\caption{Normalized transmitted electric intensity spectra of the PAM versus $L/p$ for $\\theta = 0^o$.

Such a system can be used for many applications as for temperature or pressure sensors, or characterization of an electro-optical (EO) material. We now assume that the middle region sandwiched in-between polarizers with $\\theta\\neq 0^o$ is filled with an isotropic, homogeneous and transparent EO material (see fig. \\ref{fig:MalusLawvsOPL_theta10} (b)). It is interesting to remark that the two metallic polarizers play also the role of electrodes to tune the refractive index $n_i(V)$ of the EO material. For this study, the value of the distance $d$, corresponding to the EO material's thickness, is fixed so that $L$ only varies with its refractive index $n_i$. The dimensions are $p=200\\mu m, a_x=90\\mu m, a_y=180\\mu m$, $t=200\\mu m$ and $d=200\\mu m $.\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:MalusLawvsOPL_theta10} (a) shows the transmitted electric intensity spectrum according to $n_i$. Contrary to the intensity spectra plotted in fig. \\ref{IvsLambGap} ($\\theta = 0^{\\circ}$), oblique and very narrow dark branches appear (when $\\theta \\neq 0^{\\circ}$) in transmission bands corresponding to transmission dips satisfying $n_i=m\\lambda/(2d)$ ($u^2=1$). In order to match the refractive index range of most of the material in the THz domain ($n_i$ approximately between $3$ and $4$ \\cite{wu_design_1996}), we must consider the branch $m=4$. As a remark, we note that the device can be adapted to any range of refractive index values by adjusting the value of the order $m$. The sensitivity $S$ associated to those dark branches is in our case:\n\n", "index": 19, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nS = \\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\Delta n_i} = \\frac{2d}{m}, \\ \\ \\forall\\theta \\neq 0^{\\circ}\n\\label{Sens}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S=\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\Delta n_{i}}=\\frac{2d}{m},\\ \\ \\forall\\theta\\neq 0^{\\circ}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mi>m</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>\u2200</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow><mo>\u2260</mo><msup><mn>0</mn><mo>\u2218</mo></msup></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07022.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith $A$ and $B$ two empirical and positive parameters, and $\\theta$ expressed in degree.

Then, we deduce the minimum variation of the refractive index $(\\Delta n_i)_{min}$ which can be detected by the device. Heterodyne detectors in THz domain offers spectral resolution ($R=\\Delta\\lambda/\\lambda$) equal to $3.3 \\times 10^{-6}$ (see \\cite{chusseau2008optoelectronique}). Thus, according to eq. \\eqref{Qual}, to reach $Q=1/R =3 \\times 10^5$, $\\theta$ must be equal to $0.4^{\\circ}$ at $n_i=3.38$ and $\\lambda=338\\mu m$. With such a quality factor, we derive from eq. \\eqref{Sens} that $(\\Delta n_i)_{min}= \\lambda/(S.Q) = 1.1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nConsequently, we have designed a very efficient system for THz applications ($S=100\\mu m/RIU$, $Q=3.10^5$). By comparison, Ranjan Singh \\emph{et al.} \\cite{singh_ultrasensitive_2014} has experimentally proposed a metasurface reaching $S=57\\mu m$/RIU and $Q=28$. We have to remind that our numerical results are obtained from a theory which assumes a perfect (rigorously identical apertures) and infinite periodicity of the metallic polarizers in addition to a perfect parallelism between polarizer and analyzer. We also assume an isotropic and lossless EO material. We expect that breaking these assumptions may affect the performances of the proposed system.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn summary, we have given an analytical formalism of an extended Malus' Law with metallic polarizer for the terahertz regime. Our theoretical investigation highlights the important discrepancies with the classical Malus' Law due to the $\\theta$ dependency of the modulation factor as well as the multiple reflections inside the PAM which are tunable through the optical path $L$. Indeed, for specific values of $L$ one can obtain broad angle or narrow angle Malus' Law. Then, we designed a structure for characterizing, with high sensitivity and high quality factor, the electro-optical response of terahertz EO material based on an extremely narrow angle Malus' Law. This analytical model of a two-layers stack of subwavelength structures provides new theoretical insights into the interactions between polarizing metamaterials. This simple structure can be seen as the basic component for multi-layered and more complex structures. In future works, we will further use our analytical model as a platform to propose other applications such as high efficiency polarization conversion, high-Q filtering and ultra-sensitive polarimetry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThis project has been performed in cooperation with the Labex ACTION program (contract ANR-11-LABX-0001-01).\n\\end{acknowledgments}\n\n\n\\bibliography{MLA110116}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 25921, "prevtext": "\nFor $m=4$, we have $S = 100\\mu m$/RIU.
