The candidate disks are well-fit by a model with a disk-shaped profile and have masses consistent with known Class 0 and I disks.  The inner-disk surface densities of the VANDAM candidate disks have shallower density profiles compared to disks around more evolved Class II systems.  The best-fit model radii of the seven early-result candidate disks are $R_{c}$ $>$ 10 AU; at 8 mm, the radii reflect lower limits on the disk size since dust continuum emission is tied to grain size and large grains radially drift inwards. These relatively large disks, if confirmed kinematically, are inconsistent with theoretical models where the disk size is limited by strong magnetic braking to $<$ 10 AU at early times. \n\\end{abstract}\n\\keywords{protoplanetary disks --- stars: protostars}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\nDisks around young protostars are intrinsically linked to planet formation, binary formation, and protostellar mass \naccretion \\citep{wc11,ar11}.  \nIn spite of their importance in star formation, when and how disks form--and their properties at early times--are poorly constrained. Hence, whether large and massive disks can form in young protostars \\citep[i.e.~Class 0/I stages,][]{an00,du14} is subject to debate \\citep[e.g.,][respectively]{jg09,ch08,ma10}.  Theoretical studies demonstrate magnetic fields can affect the formation timescales and properties of disks.  In particular, strong magnetic fields can remove angular momentum from a collapsing envelope via magnetic braking, reducing forming disks to $R$ $<$ 10 AU \\citep[e.g.,][]{ml08,db10,ma11,li11,dbk12}.  \nComplicating the issue, several mechanisms can lessen the effects of magnetic braking, leading to larger disks: misalignment between the rotation axis and magnetic field of the system \\citep[e.g.,][]{jo12,li13}, turbulence \\citep[e.g.,][]{se13,jo13}, and initial conditions \\citep[e.g.,][]{ma14}.\nThe protostellar stage represents the stage with the largest mass reservoir available to form disks, therefore understanding the properties of disks at early epochs is crucial to determine the formation mechanism behind these structures.\n\nProtostellar disks, however, are difficult to observe.\nClass 0 protostars and disks are so enshrouded that $\\gtrsim$90\\% of their  \nmillimeter emission comes from\nthe envelope \\citep{lo00}.  \nThe three Class 0 protostars that have been observed with \nenough resolution and sensitivity to determine their disk properties and detect Keplerian rotation (L1527, VLA 1623, and HH212) have $R$ $>$ 30 AU disks, larger than expected \nfrom strong magnetic braking models \\citep{oh14,to12,mu13,cd14}.\nObservational limitations prevent smaller disks from being detected; these Class 0 disks may not represent typical disks at this stage of evolution.\nClass I protostars are less embedded and have cleared enough of their mass reservoir that more disks have been detected than in Class 0 systems \\citep[e.g.,][]{ha14}, though not as many disks have been revealed as in more-evolved Class II sources \\citep[e.g.,][]{an09,an10}.\nWithout detection and study of more disks around \n the youngest protostellar systems, we cannot characterize early \nconditions of mass accretion onto the central protostar and planet formation because evolutionary mechanisms can change disk properties by the Class II phase \\citep{wc11}.\n\n \\begin{figure*}[t]\n        \\centering\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{mJy_SVS13B_dmr_025_color_bigfont.eps}\n                \\label{fig1a}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{mJy_Per50_dmr_025_color_bigfont.eps}\n                \\label{fig1b}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{mJy_IRAS4C_dmr_025_color_bigfont.eps}\n                \\label{fig1c} \n                \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{mJy_Per30_dmr_025_color_bigfont.eps}\n                \\label{fig1d} \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{mJy_HH211_dmr_025_color_bigfont.eps}\n                \\label{fig1e}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{mJy_IC348_dmr_025_color_bigfont.eps}\n                \\label{fig1f}\n                \\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{mJy_PerEmb8_dmr_025_color_bigfont.eps}\n                \\label{fig1g}\n        \\caption{VLA A+B array data (left), $q=0.25$ model from {\\it u,v}-plane best-fit (center), and\nresidual (right).

Nevertheless, so little is known about this early stage of disk evolution that even continuum-only imaging of young disks provides useful constraints on their properties.\n\nIn this Letter, we present the first results toward some of the protostellar disk candidates \naround Class 0 and \nClass I sources from the VANDAM survey.  We show the observed structures are \nconsistent with disks by fitting \nthe 8 mm dust-continuum data in the {\\it u,v}-plane to a simple, parameterized\nemission model based on the Shakura-Sunyaev disk model.  \nVANDAM survey data provide an unparalleled opportunity to study the youngest disks: the unsurpassed  resolution, sample size, and sensitivity for Class 0 and I protostars, permit a detailed examination of typical continuum properties of young disks.\\\\\n\n\n \\begin{table*}[t!]\n\\caption{Source Data}\n        \\vspace{-0.5cm}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccccc}\n\\hline\nSource & Class  & Deconvolved Size & Disk P.A. & Disk Inclination  & $F_{8mm}$ & $M_{d}$ & $F_{>1700k\\lambda}$\\\\\n&   &  (mas$\\times$mas) & ($^{\\circ}$) & ($^{\\circ}$)  & ($\\mu$Jy) & (M$_{\\odot}$) & ($\\mu$Jy)\\\\\n\\hline\nSVS13B &  0 & 163$\\times$80 & 71.4$\\pm$2.5 & 61 & 1352.7$\\pm$11.6 & 0.14 - 0.29 & 82.0 \\\\ \nPer-emb-50 &  I &  137$\\times$53 & 170.0$\\pm$0.3  & 67 &1664.9$\\pm$12.5 &  0.18 - 0.36 & 133.2 \\\\ \nPer-emb-14 &  0 &  174$\\times$76 & 12.7$\\pm$0.9  & 64 & 882.1$\\pm$13.0 & 0.09 - 0.19 & 68.8\\\\ \nPer-emb-30 &  0 &  87$\\times$74 & 40.0$\\pm$23.0  &31 & 957.0$\\pm$9.4 &  0.10 - 0.21 & 130.9 \\\\ \nHH211-mms &  0 &  93$\\times$59 & 34.8$\\pm$9.6  & 51& 867.5$\\pm$8.1 &  0.09 - 0.19 & 42.9 \\\\ \nIC348 MMS & 0 &  145$\\times$105 & 70.8$\\pm$2.2  & 44 & 1126.5$\\pm$10.3 & 0.12 - 0.24 & 0.0\\\\ \nPer-emb-8 &  0 &  111$\\times$84 & 116.1$\\pm$2.8  & 41 & 1120.7$\\pm$10.3 &  0.12 - 0.24 & 126.5\\\\ \n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\tablecomments{Sizes and angles are measured from image-plane 2D Gaussian fits.

Some observations were conducted as 1.5 hour blocks.\n  3C48 served as the flux calibrator, and 3C84 was the bandpass calibrator. \n The observations were taken in fast-switching mode to account for rapid atmospheric phase variations, \n with a 2.5 minute total cycle time to switch between the target source and the complex gain calibrator, \n J0336+3218.  The total integration time on each source was $\\sim$30 minutes for both A-array and B-array.  \n We reduced the data with CASA 4.1.0 and the VLA pipeline (version 1.2.2). \n We executed additional flagging beyond pipeline flagging by inspecting the phase, gain and bandpass\n  calibration solutions.  VLA Ka-band data sets have an estimated amplitude \n  calibration uncertainty of $\\sim$10\\%, but only statistical uncertainties are considered in our \n  analysis.  \\\\\n \n\n\n \\begin{figure*}[t!]\n        \\centering\n                \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{PerEmb14_x25_ffs_visprof_resid_30logbinsAB.eps}\n                \\label{fig1a}               \n        \\caption{Sample real vs {\\it u,v}-distance plot of 8 mm data.

These envelope density profiles represent, respectively, free-fall collapse and the singular \nisothermal sphere \\citep{sh77}. \nThe best-fit models were determined from the maximum likelihood, i.e.~the lowest $\\chi^{2}$ value, of \nall models fit to the data.  Values of $q$ near 0.5 are predicted by theory \\citep[e.g.,][]{cg97} for Class II protostars, which are more evolved than the protostars in our sample.\nLower values of $q$ result in lower values of $\\chi^{2}_{\\mathrm{reduced}}$ for six candidate disks.  Values of $q$ $<$ 0.5 for Class 0 and younger Class I sources are  favored since the envelope mass reservoir is still large, and radiation is reprocessed from the protostar and directed back onto the disk, increasing the brightness of the outer disk relative to the inner regions of the disk and flattening the brightness distribution  \\citep{da96}.  Compared to the other modeled protostars,\n$\\chi^{2}_{\\mathrm{reduced}}$ is notably higher for SVS13B\nwhich may be a more complicated source and not well described by the model. \\\\\n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\caption{8mm Best-fit Modeling Results}\n        \\vspace{-0.5cm}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\hline\nSource & $q$ & $\\gamma$ & $R_{c}$  & $\\chi^{2}_{\\mathrm{reduced}}$  \\\\\n&  &  & (AU)  &   \\\\\n\\hline\nSVS13B & 0.25 & 0.21$^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ & 24.28$_{-1.7}^{+2.1}$ & 2.194 \\\\\n & 0.50& 0.42$^{+0.25}_{-0.21}$  &  25.50$_{-1.5}^{+1.9}$  & 2.185  \\\\\n & 0.75& 0.63$^{+0.24}_{-0.22}$ & 26.46$_{-1.4}^{+1.6}$  & 2.175  \\\\\n & 1.00& 0.85$^{+0.26}_{-0.23}$ & 27.28$_{-1.2}^{+1.4}$  & 2.164  \\\\\n\\cline{1-5}\nPer-emb-50 & 0.25& 0.08$^{+0.02}_{-0.16}$ & 21.9$_{-0.9}^{+0.8}$ & 1.556  \\\\\n & 0.50&  0.26$^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$ & 23.3$_{-1.0}^{+1.1}$ & 1.558 \\\\\n & 0.75& 0.44$^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$  & 24.6$_{-1.1}^{+1.4}$ & 1.560 \\\\\n & 1.00&  0.64$^{+0.16}_{-0.18}$ & 25.7$_{-1.3}^{+1.4}$& 1.563 \\\\\n\\cline{1-5}\nPer-emb-14 & 0.25& -0.11$^{+0.16}_{-0.00}$ &28.5$_{-2.1}^{+2.3}$ & 1.110  \\\\\n  & 0.50& 0.09$^{+0.08}_{-0.21}$ &  30.6$_{-2.3}^{+2.8}$& 1.114  \\\\\n  & 0.75& 0.27$^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$ & 32.5$_{-2.8}^{+2.2}$ & 1.119  \\\\\n  & 1.00& 0.48$^{+0.19}_{-0.23}$ & 33.9$_{-3.1}^{+3.6}$ & 1.123  \\\\\n\\cline{1-5}\nPer-emb-30 & 0.25&0.02$^{+0.18}_{-0.31}$  & 14.0$_{-0.9}^{+1.0}$& 1.100 \\\\\n & 0.50& 0.20$^{+0.04}_{-0.32}$  & 14.9$_{-1.1}^{+1.9}$ &1.102  \\\\\n & 0.75& 0.39$^{+0.30}_{-0.34}$  & 15.8$_{-1.3}^{+1.9}$  &1.104  \\\\\n & 1.00&0.59$^{+0.14}_{-0.33}$  & 16.5$_{-1.6}^{+31.3}$ &1.107  \\\\\n\\cline{1-5}\nHH211-mms & 0.25& 0.48$^{+0.40}_{-0.78}$ & 10.5$_{-0.8}^{+0.8}$& 1.009  \\\\\n & 0.50& 0.65$^{+0.43}_{-0.82}$  & 11.0$_{-0.9}^{+1.0}$ & 1.009  \\\\\n & 0.75& 0.81$^{+0.42}_{-0.79}$ &11.5$_{-1.2}^{+1.2}$ & 1.009  \\\\\n & 1.00& 1.01$^{+0.44}_{-0.81}$  &11.9$_{-1.3}^{+1.4}$ & 1.009  \\\\\n\\cline{1-5}\nIC348 MMS & 0.25& -0.58$^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ & 25.7$_{-2.2}^{+2.8}$ & 1.085  \\\\\n  & 0.50& -0.39$^{+0.19}_{-0.11}$ & 29.0$_{-2.6}^{+3.2}$& 1.096  \\\\\n  & 0.75&  -0.19$^{+0.11}_{-0.27}$ & 31.6$_{-2.9}^{+4.1}$  & 1.107  \\\\\n  & 1.00& 0.02$^{+0.07}_{-0.11}$ & 33.7$_{-3.1}^{+4.3}$  & 1.118  \\\\\n\\cline{1-5}\nPer-emb-8 & 0.25& 0.01$^{+0.16}_{-0.19}$  &19.0$_{-1.1}^{+1.2}$ & 1.099  \\\\\n & 0.50&   0.20$^{+0.17}_{-0.20}$   & 20.2$_{-1.3}^{+1.4}$&  1.107  \\\\\n & 0.75&   0.40$^{+0.17}_{-0.21}$  &21.2$_{-1.4}^{+1.6}$  & 1.114  \\\\\n & 1.00& 0.61$^{+0.17}_{-0.20}$ & 22.1$_{-1.6}^{+1.8}$ & 1.122  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\tablecomments{Values of $q$ are fixed.

The best-fit models for our seven sources yield $-0.58<\\gamma<0.45$. Negative values of $\\gamma$ indicate increasing surface density with radius, inconsistent with disks, yet for all sources at least one value of $q$ exists which produces a positive best-fit $\\gamma$ (Table 3).  \\citet{an10} determined $\\gamma$ at 880 $\\mu$m for disks around Class II \nobjects using a two-dimensional parametric model with a prescription of the surface density profile similar to\n the radial surface brightness distribution applied in this Letter.   The Class II sources have values of \n$0.4<\\gamma<1.1$, larger than VANDAM results.  \n The modeled, surface density profiles of the Class 0 and I systems  \n taper off less quickly with radius compared to the Class II systems inside the characteristic radius $R_c$.\n\nThe best-fit model radii of \nthe candidate Class 0  disks are between $\\sim$15-30 AU, except HH211-mms with $R_{c}$ $\\sim$ 10 AU.   These are smaller \nthan the Keplerian disks found in L1527 and VLA 1623 at 1.3 mm\n  \\citep[$R$ $\\sim$ 54 AU and $R$ $\\sim$ 189 AU respectively]{oh14,mu13} \n  but consistent with the size of HH212  \\citep[R $>$ 30 AU]{cd14}.  The modeled radii (Table 3) are a factor of 1 to 1.5 times larger than the deconvolved sizes (Table 2). \n  The radii of the new candidate\ndisks may represent lower limits on disk sizes because continuum emission from dust is biased by dust\ngrain size.  Radial drift \\citep{bi10,we77} sends large grains inward in the disk, and so the long wavelength observations\n preferentially trace\ninner disk emission \\citep{pe12}.  We expect the 8 mm dust-modeled radii to be less than the gas disk radius, and so the 8 mm \nradii are lower-limits on disk size; multi-wavelength observations that include gas tracers are required to further constrain disk radii.\nPer-emb-14 was resolved at 1.3 mm by \\citet{to15b} with $R$ $\\sim$ 100 AU; thus the disk is indeed likely larger than the 8 mm radius quoted here.\n In all cases, the previously known disks and new candidate Class 0 disks are larger than the expected \n upper limit of 10 AU from  strong magnetic braking models \\citep[e.g.,][]{db10}.\n\nThe seven VANDAM candidate disks are well-fit by a disk-shaped model and have disk\nmasses, values of $\\gamma$, and radii consistent with known disks.  These candidate disks can be\ncompared to the well-studied Class 0 systems with disks: L1527 \\citep{to12} and VLA 1623 \n\\citep{ml13}.  L1527 and VLA 1623 have large Keplerian disks \\citep[$R$ $\\sim$ 50 AU,][]{oh14,mu13}  as well as misaligned magnetic fields and rotation axes \\citep{hu14}, suggesting that misaligned fields and large disks may be linked \\citep{sc15}.   \n The discrepancy between theoretical and observed disk sizes could be due to misalignment between the magnetic field and rotation axis, which changes the strength of magnetic braking, allowing disks to grow at early times  \\citep{hc09,jo12,li13,ku13}.  \n Similarly, aligned orientations would strengthen magnetic braking and limit disk size, as seen in Class 0 source B335 with a disk of $R$ $<$ 5 AU \\citep{ye15,hu14}.\nThe large Keplerian Class 0 disks and new  candidate disks indicate significant magnetic braking either has already occurred, has not happened, or the magnetic field is weak enough for disks with $R$ $>$ 10 AU around these Class 0 protostars to form, though other configurations are possible.\n\nIt is illustrative to compare the presence of VANDAM candidate disks to the magnetic field morphology of the systems. The TADPOL survey examines protostellar dust polarization and hence plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation. \\citep{hu14}.  For sources with detected magnetic fields,\n we are able to determine\n which systems have misaligned \n orientations between the outflow  (a proxy for rotation axis) and the average \n magnetic field orientation.\nThe magnetic field morphologies of two of the seven VANDAM sources in this Letter (HH211-mms and SVS13B) were also examined as a part of the TADPOL survey.  \n  A qualitative \ncomparison between the VANDAM data and the TADPOL magnetic field orientation reveals that   \nHH211-mms and SVS13B morphologies agree with\nthe tentative link between $R$ $>$ 10 AU disks and misaligned orientations \\citep{sc15}. \nHH211-mms has a clearly misaligned orientation \\citep{hu14}, agreeing with theoretical predictions that disks with $R$ $>$ 10 AU disks form at early times in systems with non-parallel orientations.\nSVS13B has a more complicated magnetic field morphology with an average aligned orientation \\citep{hu14} with the outflow \\citep{ba98}, however the TADPOL data has lower resolution than our data ($\\sim$3$^{\\prime\\prime}$, or 700 AU), and the innermost regions of the magnetic field has misaligned orientation near the candidate disk.  The small-scale, misaligned orientation in SVS13B could be caused by magnetic fields being wrapped up with the rotating disk, and the aligned magnetic field lines further from the disk are  less influenced by the disk wrapping.\\\\\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nThe first results of the VANDAM survey revealed new candidate Class 0 and I disks in continuum \nemission in the Perseus molecular cloud and is the most sensitive, most complete, and highest resolution survey of young protostellar disks to-date.  \n For seven of the VANDAM systems, we fit the deprojected, averaged, and binned \ndata in the {\\it u,v}-plane to a disk-shaped profile, accounting for a free-free point source potentially contaminating the dust emission, \nto affirm the disk candidacy of the sources and to begin to model disk properties.  To confirm that these disks are true, rotationally-supported disks, kinematic follow-up observations are\nrequired.   The seven VANDAM candidate disks are well-fit by a model with a disk-shaped profile and have masses comparable to known disks. The inner-disk surface densities of the Class 0 and I candidate disks taper off less quickly with radius than their Class II counterparts. \n\n The best-fit model radii of the new candidate disks are $R_{c}$ $>$ 15 AU, except HH211-mms with $R_{c}$ $\\sim$ 10 AU.\nSince magnetic braking is expected to suppress Class 0 disks to $R$ $<$ 10 AU, this\nsuggests that magnetic braking has already ended or is inconsequential in some Class 0 sources.  At\n8 mm, the modeled radii are lower limits on the disk size since dust continuum emission is tied to grain\nsize and large grains radially drift inwards in the disk; the actual sizes of the disks may be larger.  \nMulti-wavelength observations are needed to put added constraints on disk radii.  Furthermore, \ntheory predicts larger disk growth in systems with misaligned outflow axes and magnetic field \norientations, and the early VANDAM candidate disk results combined with polarization data for two of \nthe sources indicate that indeed $R$ $>$ 10 AU disks have formed in systems with misaligned \norientations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\nThis research made use of APLpy, an open-source plotting package for Python hosted at http://aplpy.github.com. \n\nDMSC is currently supported by  NRAO Student Observing Support grant SBC NRAO 2015-06997.

We  \nazimuthally averaged the visibility data in the {\\it u,v}-plane and binned the data in linearly spaced bins of width 50 k$\\lambda$  \nfrom 0 to 1500 k$\\lambda$, switching to 30 log-spaced bins from 1500 to 4000 k$\\lambda$ \nwhere the data becomes noisier in order to boost the signal-to-noise level at large {\\it u,v}-distances.\nWe accounted for a lower-limit free-free point source component emanating from shocks in the protostellar jets \\citep{an98}.  Because point sources in the image domain have constant flux density at all {\\it u,v}-distances, we account for the free-free component by calculating the average real component of the binned data with {\\it u,v}-distance \n$>$1700 k$\\lambda$ and include the average as a flat, linear component of the model (Table 2); the profiles become flat at values $>$1700 k$\\lambda$ in all seven sources (e.g., Figure 2).  \n\nWe fitted the real components of the deprojected, averaged, and binned profile to a simple\ndisk model using a C-based implementation of \\texttt{emcee}, an affine-invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo ensemble sampler \\citep{gw10,fm13}. The imaginary components were assumed to be zero in the model\nsince the disk is positioned at the phase center and assumed to be symmetric.\n The model mimics  a Shakura-Sunyaev \ndisk \\citep{ss73} with a power law temperature profile; the resultant model disk surface brightness profile is\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nI(r)\\propto\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{c}}\\right)^{-\\left(\\gamma+q\\right)}\\exp{\\bigg\\{\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{c}}\\right)^{\\left(2-\\gamma\\right)}}\\bigg\\},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"I(r)\\propto\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{c}}\\right)^{-\\left(\\gamma+q\\right)}\\exp{\\bigg{\\{}%&#10;\\left(\\frac{r}{R_{c}}\\right)^{\\left(2-\\gamma\\right)}}\\bigg{\\}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u221d</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>r</mi><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">{</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>r</mi><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></msup><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">}</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
