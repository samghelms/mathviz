This method maximizes the signal to noise under the conditions that the pulse shape and noise are stationary. However in real detectors, these conditions are not always satisfied for a variety of reasons.\n\nWe describe here the use of principal component analysis (PCA) [\\cite{Malinowski:2002}] as a non-parametric analysis approach that requires no prior knowledge of the dataset for the pulse processing of low temperature detectors [\\cite{Busch:LTD16}]. In this work, we draw upon a PCA-based approach used in x-ray spectromicroscopy analysis [\\cite{Lerotic:2004br,Lerotic:2014ii}] to examine a simple simulated dataset consisting of pulses of different decay times and different pulse heights. We then apply our approach to a real dataset with severe pulse shape variation.  \n\n\\section{Principal Component Analysis}\n\\label{sec:pca_math}\n\nWhen x-rays are absorbed in superconducting microcalorimeter detectors, a pulse is generated over some finite time before equilibrium is restored.\nConsider a set of individually triggered detector pulses ($n = 1, \\ldots N$) which are each sampled in time ($t = 1, \\ldots T$), yielding a data matrix $D_{T \\times N}$.

As shown in the right subfigure, when decomposed this dataset contains two primary eigenvectors. The third (and higher) eigenvector contains no shape information and corresponds to noise in the dataset. Thus, we can rebuild the dataset as $D^{\\prime}_{T\\times N} = C_{T\\times S^{\\prime}=2}\\cdot R_{S^{\\prime}=2 \\times N}$. As shown in the left subfigure in Fig.~\\ref{fig:fake-fig2}, noise is greatly filtered yet the pulse shape and height features remain. The right subfigure of Fig.~\\ref{fig:fake-fig2} shows the distribution of elements from the weighting matrix $R_{S^{\\prime}=2 \\times N}$, where components 1 and 2 respectively are the weighting factors of the 1$^{\\rm st}$ and 2$^{\\rm nd}$ eigenvectors.\n\nFor pulses with the same shape and height, their weighting factors are the same, so a plot of individual pulses as dots at their particular eigenvector weightings shows four clusters in the right subfigure of Fig.~\\ref{fig:fake-fig2}. For pulses with same shape and different height, they have the same ratio of component 1 to component 2.  For pulses with different shape but the same height, the linear combination of their weightings is the height, so their data points are on the same line with lines that correspond to different heights parallel to each other.\n\n\\section{Analysis of TKID Data Using PCA}\n\\label{sec:pca_for_tkid_data}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[\n  width=1.\\linewidth,\n  keepaspectratio]{pulses}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Figure on the {\\it Top Left} shows several individual pulses from the TKID device. A clear shape difference could be seen at the beginning. After some equilibrium time the pulses go to two branches; the lower one is Mn $K\\alpha$, and the upper one is Mn $K\\beta$. The Figure on the {\\it Top Right} is the first fifteen eigenvalues and the {\\it Bottom Left} the first six eigenvectors. The {\\it Bottom Right} figure shows two raw pulses ({\\it black}) in comparison with PCA reconstructed pulses (Eq.~\\ref{eqn:rebuilt_data}) for $S^{\\prime}=1,2,3$ ({\\it red}) (Color figure online). }\n\n\\label{fig:tkid-data1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe now apply the PCA method to a real dataset from an x-ray thermal kinetic inductance detector (TKID). While other groups have reported TKIDs with 75 eV resolution at 6 keV [\\cite{Ulbricht:2015kz}], we worked here with a TKID [\\cite{Quaranta:2013jg, Miceli:2014kn}] from which pulse shapes were strongly dependent on the location on the sensor at which an x-ray was absorbed (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:tkid-data1} {\\it Top Left}). About $30 \\mu$s after the start of a pulse, the pulse shape does not vary and the amplitude is proportional to the energy, the Mn $K\\alpha$ and Mn $K\\beta$ lines of the Fe-55 source become apparent. In such a dataset, a traditional matched or optimal filter gives no energy information, since the pulse shapes are so different that energy could not be simply extracted from pulse height or area. This has motivated us to consider a PCA analysis which makes no assumptions of the dataset. \n\nFollowing the PCA analysis presented in Sec.~\\ref{sec:pca_math}, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated and shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:tkid-data1}. The first two eigenvalues are most significant, but eigenvalues 3--9 encode some subtle variations in the data. In particular, the fluctuations near a time of 1500 $\\mu$s are related to the jitter in the rise time; these components are likely highly correlated with arrival time. A variant of PCA analysis (using singular variant decomposition, or SVD) recently has been studied for the detection of nearly-coincident pulses [\\cite{Alpert:LTD16}]. While the components beyond the first two may show some correlation with photon energy, we restrict the analysis in this paper to the first two components for simplicity. We can see from the bottom right subfigure in Fig.~\\ref{fig:tkid-data1} that there is qualitatively no large difference between $S^{\\prime}=2$ and $S^{\\prime}=3$, though rigorous and robust selection metrics for $S^{\\prime}$ need to be developed in the future. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[\n  width=1.\\linewidth,\n  keepaspectratio]{cluster}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The {\\it Left} figure shows the distribution of elements in the weighting matrix $R_{S^{\\prime}=2 \\times N}$ from the PCA analysis of the TKID data. The {\\it Upper} insert shows a pileup event and the {\\it Lower} insert shows a low energy event, both with a position separate from the main cluster. The {\\it Right} figure is the histogram of the pulse set.}\n\n\\label{fig:components_and_histogram}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to extract energy information, we examined the weighting matrix $R_{S^{\\prime}\\times N}$ with $S^{\\prime}=2$ which is a 2D scatter plot shown in the left subfigure of Fig~\\ref{fig:components_and_histogram}.  We see two clusters which we associate with the Mn $K\\alpha$ (black) and Mn $K\\beta$ (blue) lines; black points are pulses in the lower $K\\alpha$ branch as in the {\\it Top Left} figure of Fig.~\\ref{fig:tkid-data1}, and blue ones (those who are not outliers) are in the higher $K\\beta$ branch. These clusters can be automatically detected and separated [\\cite{Malinowski:2002}], and we have already used these automated approaches in other contexts [\\cite{Lerotic:2004br,Lerotic:2014ii}].\nBy fitting a line (red) to the Mn $K\\alpha$ cluster, we can generate an axis which was used to rotate the 2D scatter plot of the weighting matrix so that the clusters are vertical [\\cite{PositionCorrelation}]. \nThe projection onto the x-axis is used to generate the energy histogram in the right subfigure in Fig.~\\ref{fig:components_and_histogram}. Thus, the energy can be correlated to a linear combination of the first two PCA components. \n\nWe should note that this dataset includes pileup (i.e., more than one pulse in a single time record $T$) and low energy events. These events, shown in the insertion in the left subfigure of Fig~\\ref{fig:components_and_histogram}, result in PCA weights that are vastly different, or points isolated from the main clusters.  By using $S^{\\prime} > 2$  components, pileups can be further distinguished from low energy events. This suggests that PCA can be effective for pileup rejection.\n\nOne disadvantage of PCA is its time-consuming eigenvector calculation. A solution is to use a smaller set of pulses as a training set. As an example, we used the first 200 pulses to perform the  PCA decomposition and obtain an eigenvector set $C^{training}_{T\\times S^{\\prime}}$. Selecting $S^{\\prime} = 2$, and using Eq.~\\ref{eqn:r_matrix}, we obtained the weighting matrix for the remaining $N = 3088$ pulses, which is shown in the left subfigure of Fig.~\\ref{fig:data_training}. Compared to the left subfigure of Fig~\\ref{fig:components_and_histogram}, despite an inverse of the first component the training data agrees well with what we obtain from direct PCA composition of the entire dataset. The energy histogram also shows very little change. With the trained set of eigenvectors, the PCA reconstruction of the data simplified to a matrix multiplication. This method could enable fast, real-time pulse processing. More work is needed to determine a sufficient number of pulses for the training set. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[\n  width=1.\\linewidth,\n  keepaspectratio]{trained_data_cluster}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The {\\it Left} figure represents the entire dataset's weighting matrix data distribution, which is calculated with a training eigenvector set from 200 pulses. The {\\it Right} figure is the energy histogram generated after rotating this weighting matrix.}\n\n\\label{fig:data_training}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\nWe have introduced a non-parametric method for TKID pulse processing based on PCA, and have shown that it is beneficial for datasets with pulse shape variation. We have shown that PCA reduces data noise by the selection of a few number of components, and provides energy information by converting the data into a lower dimension basis system. Moreover, it also provides a new method to identify pileup events and for fast, real-time pulse processing. \n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nUse of the Center for Nanoscale Materials was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357.
