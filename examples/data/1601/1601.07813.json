A zero-sum flow of $G$ is an assignment of non-zero real\nnumbers to the edges of $G$ such that the sum of the values of all edges incident with\neach vertex is zero. Let $k$ be a natural number. A zero-sum $k$-flow is a flow with\nvalues from the set $\\{\\pm1, \\ldots, \\pm(k - 1)\\}$. In this paper, we prove that every 5-regular\ngraph admits a zero-sum 6-flow.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:int}\n\nAll graphs in this paper are finite and undirected without loops, possibly with parallel edges. A \\emph{nowhere-zero $k$-flow} in a graph with orientation is an assignment of an integer from $\\{-(k-1), \\ldots, -1, 1, \\ldots, (k-1)\\}$ to each of its edges such that Kirchhoff's law is respected, that is, the total incoming flow is equal to the total outgoing flow at each vertex. As noted in \\cite{Jaeger}, the existence of a nowhere-zero flow of a\ngraph $G$ is independent of the choice of the orientation. Nowhere-zero flows in graphs were introduced by Tutte\\cite{Tutte} in 1949. A great deal of research in the area has\nbeen motivated by Tutte's 5-Flow Conjecture which asserts that every 2-edge-connected\ngraph admits a nowhere-zero 5-flow. In 1983, Bouchet\\cite{Bouchet} generalized\nthis concept to bidirected graphs. A {\\em bidirected graph} $G$ is a graph with vertex set $V(G)$\nand edge set $E(G)$ such that each edge is oriented as one of the four possibilities in Figure 1.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics*[height=2.5cm]{Fig-1}\n\\caption{\\small Orientations of edges in bidirected graph.}\n\\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n{\\noindent} An edge with orientation as (a) (respectively, (b)) is called an {\\em in-edge} (respectively, {\\em out-edge}). An edge that is neither an in-edge nor an out-edge is called an {\\em ordinary edge} as in (c) or (d). An integer-valued function $f$ on $E(G)$ is a nowhere-zero bidirected $k$-flow if for every $e\\in E(G)$, $0<|f(e)|<k$, and at every vertex $v$, the value of function $f$\nin equals the value of function $f$ out.\nThe following conjecture, posed by Bouchet \\cite{Bouchet} and known as Bouchet's $6$-flow conjecture, is one of the most important problems on nowhere-zero integer flows in bidirected graphs.\n\n\\begin{conj}\n\\label{conj:Bou}\n(\\cite{Bouchet}) If a bidirected graph admits a nowhere-zero $k$-flow for some positive integer $k$, then it admits a nowhere-zero 6-flow.\n\\end{conj}\n\nIn \\cite{Bouchet}, Bouchet showed that the value $6$ in this conjecture is best possible. Raspaud and Zhu \\cite{Raspaud} proved that, if a 4-edge-connected bidirected graph admits a nowhere-zero integer flow, then it admits a nowhere-zero 4-flow, which is best possible. Recently, DeVos \\cite{DeVos} proved that the result in Bouchet's Conjecture is true if 6 is replaced by 12.\n\n\nA \\emph{zero-sum flow} (also called \\emph{nowhere-zero unoriented flow}) in a graph is an assignment of non-zero integers to the edges of $G$ such\nthat the total sum of the assignments of all edges incident with any vertex of $G$ is zero. A zero-sum\n$k$-flow in a graph $G$ is a zero-sum flow with flow values from the set $\\{\\pm 1, \\ldots, \\pm(k-1)\\}$.\nThe following conjecture is known as \\textbf{Zero-Sum Conjecture}.\n\n\n\\begin{conj}\n\\label{conj:ZSC}\n(\\cite{Akbari0}) If a graph $G$ admits a zero-sum flow, then it admits\na zero-sum 6-flow.\n\\end{conj}\n\n\nIndeed a\nzero-sum $k$-flow in $G$ is exactly a nowhere-zero $k$-flow in the bidirected graph with underlying graph $G$ such that each edge is an in-edge or out-edge. The following theorem shows the equivalence between Bouchet's Conjecture and Zero-Sum Conjecture.\n\n\\begin{thm}\n\\label{equal}\n(\\cite{Akbari1})\nBouchet's Conjecture and Zero-Sum Conjecture are equivalent.\n\\end{thm}\n\nThere are many results about Zero-Sum Conjecture recently. S. Akbari, A. Daemi, et al. \\cite{Akbari2} proved that Zero-Sum Conjecture is true for hamiltonian graphs, with 6 replaced by 12.\nThe following conjecture is a stronger version of Zero-Sum Conjecture for regular graphs.\n\n\\begin{conj}\n\\label{regular conj}\n(\\cite{Akbari1})\nEvery $r$-regular graph ($r\\ge 3$) admits a zero-sum 5-flow.\n\\end{conj}\n\nMotivated by Conjecture \\ref{regular conj}. Akbari et al. \\cite{Akbari1} proved that every $r$-regular graph ($r\\ge 3$) admits a zero-sum 7-flow.\nMoreover, Akbari et al. showed that Conjecture \\ref{regular conj} is true except for 5-regular graph.\n\n\\begin{thm}\n\\label{regular}\n(\\cite{Akbari})\nEvery $r$-regular\ngraph, where $r\\ge 3$ and $r\\neq 5$, admits a zero-sum 5-flow.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\n\nIn this paper we prove the existence of zero-sum 6-flow in 5-regular graph.\n\n\\begin{thm}\n\\label{th1}\nEvery 5-regular graph admits a zero-sum 6-flow.\n\\end{thm}\n\nWe will prove this result in Section 3. In Section 2, we introduce a new graph, called cycle-cubic tree, and give a proposition of cycle-cubic tree, which is useful to construct a zero-sum 6-flow in 5-regular graph.\n\n\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\n\\label{sec:pre}\n\nA \\emph{cycle} in this paper is meant a connected 2-regular graph. Moreover, an even (or odd) cycle is a cycle with length even (or odd). Two parallel edges form a cycle of length two.\nA \\emph{cubic} graph is a connected 3-regular graph. Let $P$ be a path and $x, y\\in V(P)$, denote by $P[x, y]$ the subpath of $P$ between $x$ and $y$, and $|P|$ the length of $P$.\nIn this paper, a vertex $v$ can be treated as a trivial path with length $0$.\nLet $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two vertex-disjoint paths of $G$, \\emph{a path connecting $P_1$ and $P_2$} is a path with all internal vertices outside $P_1\\cup P_2$ between one vertex of $P_1$ and one vertex of $P_2$.\nA \\emph{$k$-factor} of a graph is a $k$-regular spanning subgraph.\nIn particular, a 2-factor is a disjoint union of cycles that cover all vertices of the graph.\nFor integers $a$ and $b$, $1\\le a\\le b$, an \\emph{$[a, b]$-factor} of\n$G$ is defined to be a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that $a\\le d_F(v)\\le b$ for every $v\\in V(G)$, where $d_F(v)$ is the degree of $v$ in $F$. For any\nvertex $v\\in V(G)$, let $N_G(v)=\\{u\\in V(G)| uv\\in E(G) \\}$.\n\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{factor}\n(\\cite{Kano})\nLet $r\\ge 3$ be an odd integer and $k$ an integer such that $1\\le k \\le 2r/3$.\nThen every $r$-regular graph has a $[k-1, k]$-factor each component of which is regular.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\n\n\n\\delete{\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{factor sum}\n(\\cite{Akbari})\nLet G be an $r$-regular graph. Then for every even integer $q$, $2r\\le q\\le 4r$, there\nexists a function $f: E(G)\\rightarrow \\{2, 3, 4\\}$ such that for every $u\\in V(G)$,\n$\\Sigma_{v\\in N_G(u)}f(uv)=q$.\n\\end{lemma}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\delete{The following result can be easily verified.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{even}\n(\\cite{Akbari0})\nLet $r$ be an even integer with $r\\ge 4$. Then every $r$-regular graph has a\nzero-sum 3-flow.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{r}\n(\\cite{Akbari1})\nLet $G$ be an $r$-regular graph. If $r$ is divisible by 3, then $G$ has a zero-sum\n5-flow.\n\\end{lemma}\n}\n\n\n\nNext we give a basic lemma of connected graph which will be used in the proof of Lemma \\ref{c-c tree}.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{m path}\nLet $G$ be a connected graph. Then for any even number of distinct vertices of $G$, say $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{2m}$ ($m\\ge 1$),\nthere exist $m$ edge-disjoint paths in $G$ such that the $2m$ end-vertices of these $m$ paths are pairwise distinct and form the set $\\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{2m}\\}$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nSince $G$ is connected, the result is trivial when $m=1$.\n\n\\delete{Suppose $m=2$. Since $G$ is a cubic graph, there exists a path $P$ between $u_1$ and $u_2$. If there exists a path $P'$ between $u_3$ and $u_4$ such that $P$ and $P'$ are edge-disjoint, then let $P_1=P, P_2=P'$, we are done.\nThus each $P$ and $P'$ have common edges, so have common vertices. Let $x$ (and $y$) be the first (and the last) common vertex when traveling $P'$ from $u_3$ to $u_4$.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that the length of $P[u_1, x]$ is less than the length of $P[u_1, y]$. In this case, let $P_1$ be the concatenation of path $P[u_1, x]$ and $P'[x, u_3]$; $P_2$ be the concatenation of path $P[u_2, y]$ and $P'[y, u_4]$. Clearly, $P_1$ and $P_2$ are edge-disjoint paths with different end-vertices in $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3, u_{4}\\}$.}\n\n\nAssume that the result is true when the even number of vertices is less than $2m$ for $m \\ge 2$.\nNow consider $2m$ distinct vertices $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{2m}$ of $G$. By induction hypothesis, $G$ contains $m-1$ edge-disjoint paths $P^1, \\ldots, P^{m-1}$ such that the $2m-2$ end-vertices of them are pairwise distinct and form the set $\\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{2m-2}\\}$.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that $P^i$ is a path between $u_{2i-1}$ and $u_{2i}$ for $1\\le i\\le m-1$.\nIf there exists a path $P$ in $G$ between $u_{2m-1}$ and $u_{2m}$ such that $P$ and $P^i$ are edge-disjoint for each $1\\le i\\le m-1$, then $P^1, \\ldots, P^{m-1}, P$ are desired edge-disjoint paths.\nThus we assume that each path of $G$ between $u_{2m-1}$ and $u_{2m}$ has common edges with some paths in $\\{P^1, P^2, \\ldots, P^{m-1}\\}$, so has common vertices with such paths.\nChoose a path of $G$ between $u_{2m-1}$ and $u_{2m}$, say $P$.\nLet $x, y\\in V(P)$, possibly with $x=y$, be the first and last common vertices with $\\cup_{i=1}^{m-1}{P^i}$ when traveling along $P$ from $u_{2m-1}$ to $u_{2m}$, respectively.\nIf $x, y$ are vertices of the same $P^i$, say $x, y\\in V(P^1)$, then without loss of generality, we assume that $|P^1[u_1, x]|\\le |P^1[u_1, y]|$. In this case, let $P_0$ be the concatenation of $P^1[u_1, x]$ and $P[x, u_{2m-1}]$, and $P_1$ the concatenation of $P^1[u_2, y]$ and $P[y, u_{2m}]$. Let $P_{j}=P^j$ for $2\\le j\\le m-1$. Clearly, $P_0, P_1, \\ldots, P_{m-1}$ are desired edge-disjoint paths.\n\nThus we assume that $x$ and $y$ are in different $P^i$ for $i\\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m-1\\}$.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that $x\\in V(P^1)$ and $y\\in V(P^2)$. If there exists a subpath of $P$ connecting $P^1$ and $P^2$ with all internal vertices outside $\\cup_{i=3}^{m-1}{P^i}$, then without loss of generality, we assume that $P[x_1, y_1]$ is such a subpath with $x_1\\in V(P^1)$, $y_1\\in V(P^2)$, $|P^1[u_1, x]|\\le |P^1[u_1, x_1]|$ and $|P^2[u_{3}, y_1]|\\le |P^2[u_{3}, y]|$. In this case, let $P_1$ be the concatenation of $P^1[u_1, x]$ and $P[x, u_{2m-1}]$, $P_2$ the concatenation of $P^2[u_{4}, y]$ and $P[y, u_{2m}]$, and $P_m$ the concatenation of $P^1[x_1, u_{2}]$, $P[x_1, y_1]$ and $P^2[u_{3}, y_1]$. Let $P_{j}=P^j$ for $3\\le j\\le m-1$. Then $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_{m}$ are desired edge-disjoint paths.\nThen there exists no subpath of $P$ connecting $P^1$ and $P^2$ with all internal vertices outside $\\cup_{i=3}^{m-1}{P^i}$.\nThis means that any subpath of $P$ connecting $P^1$ and $P^2$ has common vertices with $\\cup_{i=3}^{m-1}{P^i}$. Thus $P$ can be decomposed into the union of subpaths of $\\{P^1, P^2, \\ldots, P^{m-1}\\}$ and subpaths  connecting any two paths in $\\{P^1, P^2, \\ldots, P^{m-1}\\}$ each with all internal vertices outside $\\cup_{i=1}^{m-1}{P^i}$.\nWithout loss of generality, we can relabel the index of paths in $\\{P^3, P^4, \\ldots, P^{m-1}\\}$ such that\nthere exists a subpath of $P$ connecting $P^1$ and $P^3$, a subpath of $P$ connecting $P^t$ and $P^2$ (where $t$ is an integer in $\\{3, \\ldots, m-2\\}$), a subpath of $P$ conneting $P^j$ and $P^{j+1}$ (for each $3\\le j\\le t-1$)  each with all internal vertices outside $\\cup_{i=1}^{m-1}{P^i}$  when traveling along $P$ from $u_{2m-1}$ to $u_{2m}$.\nLet $P[x_j, y_j]$ be such a subpath of $P$ connecting $P^j$ and $P^{j+1}$ such that $x_j\\in V(P^j)$ and $y_j\\in V(P^{j+1})$ for each $3\\le j\\le t-1$, $P[x_1, y_1]$ be such a subpath of $P$ connecting $P^1$ and $P^{3}$ such that $x_1\\in V(P^1)$ and $y_1\\in V(P^{3})$, $P[x_2, y_2]$ be such a subpath of $P$ connecting $P^t$ and $P^{2}$ such that $x_2\\in V(P^t)$ and $y_2\\in V(P^{2})$.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that $|P^j[u_{2j-1}, x_j]|\\le |P^j[u_{2j-1}, y_{j-1}]|$ for each $4\\le j\\le t-1$, $|P^1[u_{1}, x]|\\le |P^1[u_{1}, x_{1}]|$, $|P^2[u_{3}, y_{2}]|\\le |P^2[u_{3}, y]|$ and $|P^3[u_{5}, x_3]|\\le |P^3[u_{5}, y_{1}]|$ . In this case, let $P_0$ be the concatenation of $P^1[u_1, x]$ and $P[x, u_{2m-1}]$;  $P_1$ the concatenation of $P^{1}[u_{2}, x_{1}]$, $P[x_{1}, y_{1}]$ and $P^{3}[u_{6}, y_{1}]$; $P_2$ the concatenation of $P^{2}[u_{4}, y]$ and $P[y, u_{2m}]$; $P_{t}$ the concatenation of $P^{t}[u_{2t-1}, x_{2}]$, $P[x_{2}, y_{2}]$ and $P^{2}[u_{3}, y_{2}]$;\n$P_j$ the concatenation of $P^{j}[u_{2j-1}, x_{j}]$, $P[x_{j}, y_{j}]$ and $P^{j+1}[y_{j}, u_{2j+2}]$ for $3\\le j\\le t-1$.\nLet $P_{j}=P^j$ for $t+1\\le j\\le m-1$.\nThen $P_0, P_1, \\ldots, P_{m-1}, P_m$ are desired edge-disjoint paths.{\\hfill$\\Box$\\vspace{11pt}}\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor disjoint subsets $X, Y$ of $V(G)$, denote by $E_G(X, Y)$ the set of edges of $G$ with one vertex in $X$ and the other in $Y$.\nIf $H$ and $K$ are vertex-disjoint subgraphs of $G$, then we use $E_G(H, K)$ in place of $E_G(V(H), V(K))$.\nGiven a subgraph $H$ of $G$, we use $G/H$ to denote the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all edges in $H$ and deleting the resultant loops.\n\n\n\\begin{defn}\n\\label{def:c-c tree}\n{\\em\nA graph $G$ is called a \\emph{cycle-cubic tree} relative to a family ${\\mathcal{R}} = \\{R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_t\\}$, the size of this family ${\\mathcal{R}}$ is $t$, of pairwise vertex-disjoint connected graphs $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_t$ of $G$ if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\\begin{enumerate}[{(a)}]\n\n\\item $R_i$ is a cycle or a cubic graph and $V(R_1)\\cup \\ldots \\cup V(R_t)=V(G)$;\n\n\\item the graph $G_{{\\mathcal{R}}}$ ($=G/(R_1\\cup R_2\\cup \\ldots \\cup R_t)$) obtained from $G$ by identifying all vertices in each $R_i$ to form a single vertex $v_{R_i}$, $1\\le i\\le t$, is a tree;\n\n\\item the degree of $v_{R_i}$ in $G_{{\\mathcal{R}}}$ is even (respectively, odd) if and only if $R_i$ is an even cycle or a cubic graph (respectively, an odd cycle).\n\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n}\n\\end{defn}\n\nBy Definition~\\ref{def:c-c tree}, $d_G(v)\\ge 2$ for each vertex $v\\in V(G)$, and if $t=1$, then $G$ is an even cycle or a cubic graph.\nNext we prove the existence of a special function for cycle-cubic trees which is crucial to the study of zero-sum 6-flows in 5-regular graphs.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{c-c tree}\nEvery cycle-cubic tree $G$ relative to a family ${\\mathcal{R}} = \\{R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_{t}\\}$ with maximum degree at most 5 admits a function $f: E(G) \\rightarrow Z$ such that\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:fe}\nf(e)=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text{$4$ or $5$}, &\\text{if $e\\in E(R_i)$ and $R_i$ is an edge of a cycle},\\\\ [0.1cm]\n\\text{$1, 2$ or $3$}, &\\text{if $e\\in E(R_i)$ and $R_i$ is an edge of a cubic graph},\\\\ [0.1cm]\n\\text{$-2$ or $-4$}, &\\text{if $e$ is an edge outside $\\cup_{i=1}^{t}R_i$}.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f(e)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{ll}\\text{$4$ or $5$},&amp;\\text{if $e\\in E(R_{i})$ and%&#10;

Then $f(v_1u_1)+f(u_1u_{11})+f(u_1u_{12})=a+a+(6-2a)=6$, $u_1$ satisfies (2).\nIf $a=4$, then label the edges of $R_1$ with $4$ and $5$ alternatively in a chosen direction starting with an edge incident with $v_1$.\nIf $a=5$, then label the edges of $R_1$ with $5$ and $4$ alternatively in a chosen direction starting with an edge incident with $v_1$.\nIn either case, let $f(e)=f'(e)$ for all other edges of $G$. We can deduce that $f$ is a function of $G$ satisfying (1) and (2).\n\nSubcase 1.2. $R_2$ is a cubic graph.\n\nBy Definition \\ref{def:c-c tree} (c), $|E_{G}(R_2, G-V(R_2))|$ is even. Since the maximum degree of $G$ is at most 5, $0 \\le |E_{G}(u, V(G)-V(R_2))|\\le 2$ for each vertex $u\\in V(R_2)$. Then the number of vertex $u$ of $R_2$ with $|E_{G}(u, V(G)-V(R_2))|=1$ is even. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{2m}$ are all vertices with $|E_{G}(u_i, V(G)-V(R_2))|=1$ for $1\\le i\\le 2m$ and if there exists vertex $u$ such that $|E_{G}(u, V(G)-V(R_2))|=2$, then let $u_{2m+1}, \\ldots, u_{2m+k}$ are all vertices with $|E_{G}(u_{2m+i}, V(G)-V(R_2))|=2$ for $1\\le i\\le k$.\nBy Lemma \\ref{m path}, we can find $m$ edge-disjoint paths in $R_2$ such that the $2m$ end-vertices of them are pairwise distinct and constitute the set $\\{u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_{2m}\\}$. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $P_{1}$, $P_{2}$, $\\ldots$, $P_{m}$ are such paths in $R_2$, where $P_{i}$ connects $u_{2i-1}$ and $u_{2i}$. Let $P_{k+i}: u_{2m+i}$ be the trivial path in $R_2$ for $1\\le i\\le k$. Then $P_1, \\ldots, P_{m+k}$ are edge-disjoint paths in $R_2$.\nNext we construct a new graph $G'$ from $G$ by the following steps:\n\n\\emph{Step 1.} Delete all vertices of $R_2$ except vertices $\\{u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{2m}, u_{2m+1}, \\ldots, u_{2m+k}\\}$ and delete all edges in $R_2$;\n\n\\emph{Step 2.}  Add two parallel edges $u_{2i-1}u_{2i}$ if $|P_i|$ is odd; add two 2-paths $u_{2i-1}x_iu_{2i}$ and $u_{2i-1}y_iu_{2i}$ if $|P_i|$ is even for $1\\le i\\le m$;\n\n\\emph{Step 3.} Split each $u_{2m+i}$ into two vertices $w_{2m+i}$ and $z_{2m+i}$ for $1\\le i\\le k$ such that one edge of $E_G(u_{2m+i}, V(G)-V(R_2)))$ is incident with $w_{2m+i}$, the other edge of $E_G(u_{2m+i}, V(G)-V(R_2)))$ is incident with $z_{2m+i}$;\n\n\\emph{Step 4.}  Add two 2-paths $w_{2m+i} x^{2m+i} z_{2m+i}$ and $w_{2m+i} y^{2m+i} z_{2m+i}$ for $1\\le i\\le k$.\n\n\n\nBy Steps 1-4, we get a graph $G'$ which is a union of cycle-cubic trees each with smaller number of cycles and cubic graphs. By the induction hypothesis, there is a function $f'$ of $G'$ satisfying (1) and (2).\nNext we observe values under $f'$ of edges which are corresponding edges of $E_{G}(R_2, G-V(R_2))$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that $u_iv_i\\in E_{G}(R_2, G-V(R_2))$ for $1\\le i\\le 2m$ and $u_{2m+j}v_{2m+j}, u_{2m+j}v_{2m+j}^*\\in E_{G}(R_2, G-V(R_2))$ for $1\\le j\\le k$. Without loss of generality, we assume that $w_{2m+j}v_{2m+j}$ and $z_{2m+j}v_{2m+j}^*$ are edges of $G'$ for each $1\\le j\\le k$. By (1), $f'(u_iv_i), f'(w_jv_{2m+j})$ and $f'(z_jv_{2m+j}^*) \\in \\{-4, -2\\}$ for $1\\le i\\le 2m$, $1\\le j\\le k$. If $|P_i|$ is odd, then $P_i$ must be path in $\\{P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_m\\}$ and the two parallel edges $u_{2i-1}u_{2i}$ with equal values $a$ under $f'$, where $a\\in \\{4, 5\\}$ by (1), (2). Then in this case $f'(u_{2i-1}v_{2i-1})=f'(u_{2i}v_{2i})$. If $|P_i|$ is even, then when $i\\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$, $f'(u_{2i-1}x_i)=f'(u_{2i-1}y_i)=a$ and $f'(u_{2i}x_i)=f'(u_{2i}y_i)=b$, and when $i\\in \\{2m+1, \\ldots, 2m+k\\}$, $f'(w_{i}x^i)=f'(w_{i}y^i)=a$ and $f'(z_{i}x^i)=f'(z_{i}y^i)=b$, where $\\{a, b\\}=\\{4, 5\\}$ by (1), (2). Then in this case, $f'(u_{2i-1}v_{2i-1})\\neq f'(u_{2i}v_{2i})$ for $1\\le i\\le m$ and $f'(w_{i}v_{i})\\neq f'(z_iv_{i}^*)$ for $2m+1\\le i\\le 2m+k$.\n\nNext we define a function of $G$ based on $f'$. If $f'(u_{2i-1}v_{2i-1})=-2$ (or $-4$) for each $1\\le i\\le m$, then we label $E(P_{i})$ with $1, 3, 1, 3, \\ldots$ (or $3, 1, 3, 1,\\ldots$) alternatively\nstarting with the edge incident with $u_{2i-1}$.\n\nThen let  $f(e)=2$ for each $e\\in E(R_2)-\\cup_{i=1}^{m}E(P_i)$, $f(u_{2m+i}v_{2m+i})=f'(w_{2m+i}v_{2m+i})$, $f(u_{2m+i}v_{2m+i}^*)=f'(z_{2m+i}v_{2m+i}^*)$ and $f(e)=f'(e)$ for all other edges $e\\in E(G)-E(R_2)$.\nThen we can deduce that $f$ is a desired function of $G$ satisfying (1) and (2) since $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_{m}$ are pairwise edge-disjoint paths.\n\nCase 2. $|E_{G}(u_1, V(G)-V(R_2))|\\ge 2$.\n\n\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that $u_1v_1, u_1v_2\\in E_{G}(u_1, V(G)-V(R_2))$ with $v_1\\in V(R_1)$. Then $v_2$ is a vertex of $R_i$ for some $i\\neq 1, 2$.\nWe know that $u_1$ is a vertex-cut of $G$. Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be edge-disjoint subgraphs of $G$ such that $G_1\\cup G_2=G$ and $V(G_1)\\cap V(G_2)=\\{u_1\\}$, $u_1v_1, u_1v_2\\in E(G_1)$ and the other edges incident with $u_1$ are in $G_2$.\nConstructing a graph $G_1'$ from $G_1$ by replacing $u_1$ with a 4-cycle $xyzwx$ and replacing $u_1v_1, u_1v_2$ by $v_1x, v_2z$, respectively.\nClearly, $G_1'$ and $G_2$ are cycle-cubic tree each relative to a smaller number of cycles and cubic graphs.\nBy the induction hypothesis, $G_1'$ admits a desired function $f_1$ on $E(G_1')$ and $G_2$ admits a desired function $f_2$ on $E(G_2)$, both satisfying (1) and (2).\nBy the similar discussion in Subcase 1.2, $f_1(v_1x)\\neq f_1(v_2z)\\in \\{-2, -4\\}$.\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that $f_1(v_1x)=-2$ and $f_1(v_2z)=-4$ by (1) and (2). In this case, we define $f$ on $G$ such that $f(u_1v_1)=f_1(v_1x)$, $f(u_1v_2)=f_1(v_2z)$, and for all other edges $e$ of $G$, let $f(e)=f_i(e)$ if $e\\in E(G_i)$ for $i=1, 2$. Clearly, $f$ satisfies (1). We only need to prove that for vertex $u_1$, (2) satisfies. Obviously, $d_{G}(u_1)=d_{G_2}(u_1)+2$ and $\\Sigma_{v\\in N_{G}(u_1)}f(u_1v)=\\Sigma_{v\\in N_{G_2}(u_1)}f_2(u_1v)+(-2-4)=\\Sigma_{v\\in N_{G_2}(u_1)}f_2(u_1v)-6$. Then when $d_{G_2}(u_1)=2$ (or $3$), then $d_{G}(u_1)=4$ (or $5$) and $\\Sigma_{v\\in N_{G}(u_1)}f(u_1v)=9-6=3$ (or $=6-6=0$), which satisfies (2). Thus $f$ is a desired function on $G$ satisfying (1) and (2).\n{\\hfill$\\Box$\\vspace{11pt}}\n\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Proof of Lemma \\ref{th1}}\n\\label{sec:pf}\n\n\n\n\nLet $G$ be a graph and $T$ a subset of $V(G)$ with even cardinality. A set $J \\subseteq E(G)$ is called a \\emph{$T$-join} \\cite{Korte} in $G$ if for any $v\\in V(G)$, $v$ is incident with an odd number of edges in $J$ if and only if $v\\in T$. We also call the subgraph induced by $J$ a $T$-join.\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{T-join}\n(\\cite [Proposition 12.6] {Korte})\nLet $G$ be a graph and $T\\subseteq V(G)$ with $|T|$ even. There exists a $T$-join in $G$\nif and only if $|V(Q)\\cap T|$ is even for each connected component $Q$ of $G$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\smallskip\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\\textbf{of Theorem~\\ref{th1}}~\nLet $G$ be a 5-regular graph. Without loss of generality, we may assume that $G$ is connected. If $G$ contains a 2-factor, say $G_1$,  then $G_2=G-E(G_1)$ is a 3-factor of $G$. Define $f(e)=3$ for each $e\\in E(G_1)$ and $f(e)=-2$ for each $e\\in E(G_2)$. Thus $f$ is a zero-sum 4-flow of $G$, so is a zero-sum 6-flow of $G$.\n\nNow we assume that $G$ does not contain a 2-factor or a 3-factor.\nBy Lemma \\ref{factor}, $G$ has a $[2, 3]$-factor each component of which is regular. We may assume that $H=H_1\\cup H_2$ is the $[2, 3]$-factor of $G$ such that $H_1$ is 2-regular and $H_2$ is 3-regular.\nClearly, $H_1$ is a union of cycles.\nIf $H_1$ contains no odd cycles, then we can label the edges of $H_1$ by $4$ and $5$, alternatively. This labeling defines a function $f_1$ on $E(H_1)$. Then for every $u\\in V(H_1)$, $\\Sigma_{v\\in N_{H_1}(u)}f_1(uv)=9$.\nDefine $f_2(e)=2$ for each $e\\in E(H_2)$. Then $f_2$ is a function on $E(H_2)$ such that for every $u\\in V(H_2)$, $\\Sigma_{v\\in N_{H_2}(u)}f_2(uv)=6$.\nDefine $f(e)=f_1(e)$ for each $e\\in E(H_1)$; $f(e)=f_2(e)$ for each $e\\in E(H_2)$, and $f(e)=-3$ for each $e\\in E(G)\\backslash E(H)$. Then $f$ is a zero-sum 6-flow of $G$.\n\nIt remains to consider the case where $H_1$ contains odd cycles. Since $G$ is 5-regular and $H_2$ is 3-regular, $|V(G)|$ and $|V(H_2)|$ are even. Thus the number of odd cycles of $H_1$ is even.\nLet $\\{C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_{2m}\\}$ be the family of odd cycles in $H_1$, where $m\\ge 1$.\n\nSince $G$ is connected, so is $G/H$. Since $H$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$, each vertex of $G/H$ is a contracted vertex.\nLet $T=\\{v_{C_1}, v_{C_2}, \\ldots, v_{C_{2m}}\\}$. By Lemma \\ref{T-join}, there exists a $T$-join in $G/H$ such that each vertex in $T$ is odd.\nDeleting recursively all edges on a cycle when necessary, we obtain a $T$-join in $G/H$ that has no cycle. Replacing each vertex $v$ in such $T$-join by the corresponding contracted connected component of $H$, we obtain a union of  cycle-cubic trees of $G$, say $M$, relative to some connected components of $H$. We know that $M$ contains all $C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_{2m}$.\nIf $M$ does not contain all connected components of $H$, then adding the connected components of $H$ to $M$ until all connected components of $H$ are contained in $M$. This new graph is also a union of cycle-cubic trees, denoted by $M$. By Lemma \\ref{c-c tree}, each connected component of $M$ has a function satisfying (1) and (2). The union of these functions, denoted by $f'$, also satisfies (1) and (2).\nFor each edge outside $M$, define $f(e)=-3$ and let $f(e)=f'(e)$ if $e\\in M$. One can easily verify that $f$ is a zero-sum 6-flow of $G$.{\\hfill$\\Box$\\vspace{11pt}}\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\n\n\nAuthor appreciates Sanming Zhou for his valuable comments and advisements.
