In the CMSSM, at the gauge unification scale \n$\\sim {\\mathcal O}(10^{16}) \\textrm{~GeV}$ the gaugino masses are set equal to $M_{1/2}$,\nthe scalar masses are set to a universal flavour diagonal mass $m_0$ and the\nsoft supersymmetry breaking trilinear scalar couplings are set equal to a\nmassive parameter $A_0$ times the relevant Yukawa coupling. Here, for\nillustration, we set $M_{1/2}=1$ TeV, $A_0=\n-2\\>{\\rm TeV}$, the ratio of the MSSM's two\nHiggs vacuum expectation values $\\tan \\beta=10$ and the sign of the Higgs\nsuperpotential parameter term $\\mu$ to be positive. We then allow $m_0$ to\nvary, and plot the relative difference caused by the new higher order terms in\n Fig.~\\ref{fig:reldiff}a. \nFor this illustration, we have {\\em not}\\/\nincluded two-loop corrections to gauge and\nYukawa couplings and three-loop renormalisation group equations for the\nsuperpotential parameters~\\cite{Allanach:2014nba}, although with them, the\nresults are qualitatively similar.\nThe overall message from the figure is that differences of percent level order\nin the\npole masses of gluinos and squarks arise from the higher order corrections. \nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:reldiff}a, the plot does not extend to larger values of\n$m_0/M_{1/2}$, because there is no \nphenomenologically acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking there (the\nsuperpotential $\\mu$ term becomes imaginary at the minimum of the potential,\nindicating a saddle point). \nThe rough size of the two-loop correction is consistent with that\nestimated in the\nprevious literature~\\cite{Martin:2005ch,Martin:2005eg,Martin:2006ub}.\nNote that there are wiggles in the $\\tilde g$, $\\tilde t_1$, and $\\tilde t_2$ curves,\nnear $m_0/M_{1/2} = 1.35$, $2.9$, and $1.9$, respectively. These are the remnants of\nthe instabilities mentioned in section~\\ref{subsec:kinky} after smoothing by the interpolation procedure described there, with $t=0.04$. \nThese correspond to the thresholds for the\ndecays $\\tilde g \\rightarrow t \\tilde t_1$ and\n$\\tilde t_1 \\rightarrow t \\tilde g$ and $\\tilde t_2 \\rightarrow t \\tilde g$, respectively. \nAlthough the remaining wiggles are visible on the plot, they are \nsmall in absolute terms, and are of order the uncertainties \ndue to higher-order corrections.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:reldiff}b, we show the concomitant effect on the various\nnext-to-leading order\nsparticle production cross-sections at the 13 TeV LHC by \nusing {\\tt\n  NLL-Fast3.1}~\\cite{Beenakker:2015rna,Beenakker:2011fu,Beenakker:2010nq,Beenakker:1997ut,Beenakker:2011fu,Beenakker:2009ha,Kulesza:2009kq,Kulesza:2008jb,Beenakker:1996ch}. {\\tt\n  NLL-Fast3.1} calculates at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in supersymmetric QCD,\nwith next-to-leading logarithm (NLL) re-summation. However, \nit is based on fixed interpolation tables with only 3 significant digits,\nresulting in a visible jaggedness of the points in the figure. \nNonetheless, we see that the change in the gluino mass due to \nnext-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) effects\nleads to a large \n15-25$\\%$ \nreduction in the production cross-section. \nOther sparticle production cross-section modes shown decrease by more than\n5$\\%$, thus accounting for these NNLO effects is important in reducing the\ntheoretical uncertainties. Some of the curves terminate when $m_0/M_{1/2}>2.3$\nbecause {\\tt NLL-Fast3.1} considers the production cross-sections to be too\nsmall to be relevant, and so returns zeroes. \n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{Qgluino.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{QsuL.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{Qstop1.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.495\\textwidth]{Qstop2.eps}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:Qdep} \nScale dependences of gluino and squark pole mass\npredictions for the CMSSM with $m_0=M_{1/2}=1$ TeV, $A_0=0$, $\\tan \\beta=10$\nand $\\mu>0$, comparing 1-loop and 2-loop approximations.

Thus, as usual, the renormalization scale \ndependence gives only a lower bound, and not a reliable estimate, of the remaining \ntheoretical error.\n\n\\section{Summary and Conclusions}\nTwo-loop ${\\mathcal{O}}(\\alpha_s^2/(16 \\pi^2))$ are now included in the public\nrelease of {\\tt \\small SOFTSUSY}, and so are available for use. We have\ndemonstrated that along a typical line in CMSSM space, they are responsible\nfor around $\\mathcal{O}(1\\%)$ relative changes in the squark and gluino\nmasses, which will change their various production cross-sections by around\n$5-25\\%$. \nThe largest 2-loop SUSYQCD pole mass correction is for the gluino,\nand it increases as the squarks become heavier than the gluino, reaching 2\\%\nwhen $m_0/M_{1/2} = 4$.\nThese sources of theoretical error can now be taken into account and \nconsequently reduced by using the new version of {\\tt SOFTSUSY}. In turn, the\nconnection between measurements and various Lagrangian parameters (in\nparticular, soft supersymmetry breaking sparticle mass parameters) is made\nmore accurate. Thus, fits of the MSSM or NMSSM to cosmological and collider\ndata will have a smaller associated theoretical error (as would studies of the\nunification of sparticle masses were there to be a discovery and subsequent\nmeasurement of sparticles).\nOther increases in MSSM or NMSSM mass prediction accuracy await future work:\nHiggs mass predictions, gauginos and sleptons, for instance. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nThis work has been partially supported by STFC grant \nST/L000385/1.

A much-studied and\nlong-awaited framework for new physics, namely weak-scale superymmetry, is being\nsearched for in many different channels. In the several prominent explicit\nmodels of \nsupersymmetry breaking meditaion, the best chance of observing the production\nand subsequent decay of supersymmetric particles is via squark and/or gluino\nproduction. Squarks and gluinos tend to have the largest\nproduction cross-sections among the sparticles and Higgs bosons of the MSSM,\nbecause they may be produced by tree-level strong interactions, as opposed to\nsmaller electroweak cross sections relevant for the other superparticles. \nIn $R-$parity conserving supersymmetry (popular because of its\napparently viable dark matter candidate), squark and/or gluino production\nmay result in a signal of an excess of highly energetic jets in conjunction\nwith large missing \ntransverse momentum with respect to Standard Model predictions. This classic\nLHC signature was searched for at LHC Run I \nat 7 and 8 TeV centre of mass energy, but no significant excess above Standard\nModel backgrounds was observed. \nJets plus missing transverse momentum channels then provided the strongest\nconstraints \nin the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model, for instance\n(CMSSM), along with many other models of supersymmetry breaking mediation.\n\nThe higher collision energy at Run II allows for new MSSM parameter space to\nbe explored. In the event of a discovery of the production of supersymmetric\nparticles, one will want to first interpret their signals correctly, and then\nmake inferences about the superymmetry breaking parameters. In order to do\nthis with a greater accuracy, we must use higher orders in perturbation\ntheory. Of particular interest is the connection between the supersymmetric\nmasses of the squarks and gluinos and the experimental observables (functions\nof jet and missing momenta). The experimental observables may be used to infer\n{\\em pole}\\/ (or kinematic) masses of the supersymmetric particles, which may\nthen be connected via perturbation theory to the more fundamental\nsupersymmetry breaking parameters in the Lagrangian. These could then be used\nto test the underlying supersymmetry breaking mediation\nmechanism~\\cite{Allanach:2004ud,Allanach:2004ed}.\nConversely, if no significant signal for supersymmetry is to be found at the\nLHC, we shall want to interpret the excluded parameter space in terms of the\nfundamental supersymmetry breaking parameters. Again, this connection is\nsensitive (for identical reasons to the discovery case) to the order in\nperturbation theory which is used. In the most easily accessible channels at\nthe LHC (squark/gluino production), it is useful therefore to use higher\norders in the QCD gauge coupling, since this is the largest relevant expansion\nparameter. \n\nState-of-the art publicly available NMSSM or MSSM spectrum generators such as\n{\\tt ISAJET}~\\cite{Paige:2003mg}, {\\tt FlexibleSUSY}~\\cite{Athron:2014yba},\n{\\tt NMSPEC}~\\cite{Ellwanger:2006rn}, {\\tt \n  SUSPECT}~\\cite{Djouadi:2002ze}, {\\tt SARAH}~\\cite{Staub:2008uz}, \n{\\tt SPHENO}~\\cite{Porod:2003um}, {\\tt SUSEFLAV}~\\cite{Chowdhury:2011zr} or\nprevious versions of {\\tt \n  SOFTSUSY}~\\cite{Allanach:2001kg}, \n do not have\nthe complete \n${\\mathcal{O}}(\\alpha_s^2/(16 \\pi^2))$ two-loop corrections to gluino and\nsquark masses included, despite their being calculated and presented in the\nliterature~\\cite{Martin:2005ch,Martin:2005eg,Martin:2006ub}. Here, we describe\ntheir inclusion into the MSSM  \nspectrum calculation in the popular {\\tt SOFTSUSY} program, making them\npublicly available for the first time. As we emphasised above, we expect them\nto be useful in increasing the accuracy of inference from data of\nsupersymmetry breaking in the squark and gluino sectors. \n\nThe paper proceeds as follows: in the next section, the higher order terms\nthat are included are briefly reviewed. We\nthen provide an example of their effect on a line through CMSSM\nspace. After a summary, the appendices contain technical information on how to\ncompile and run {\\tt SOFTSUSY} including the higher order terms. \n\n\\section{Higher Order Terms  \\label{sec:results}} \n\nTwo-loop contributions to fermion pole masses in gauge theories were\ncalculated in Ref.~\\cite{Martin:2005ch} and these results are specialised to\ncompute the gluino pole mass. Depending upon the ratio $m_{\\tilde\n  q}/m_{\\tilde g}$, a two-loop correction of up to several percent was\nfound.\nOn the other hand, Ref.~\\cite{Martin:2005eg} calculated the two-loop\ncontributions to scalar masses from gauge theory\nand these results are\nspecialised to the two-loop squark masses, where corrections up to\nabout one percent were noted. \nIn both cases, the results were obtained in the \n$\\overline{\\rm DR}'$ renormalization scheme \\cite{Jack:1994rk}, consistent with the \nrenormalization group equations used in softly broken supersymmetric models.\nThe version of {\\tt SOFTSUSY} described here now contains these\ncomputations~\\cite{Martin:2005ch,Martin:2005eg}. \nA library for computing two-loop self-energy integrals, {\\tt\nTSIL}~\\cite{Martin:2005qm}, is included within the {\\tt SOFTSUSY}\ndistribution; there is no need to download it separately.\n\nIn addition, the gluino result has been improved by re-expanding the gluino \nself-energy function squared mass arguments around the gluino, squark, and top quark pole masses, as described in Ref.~\\cite{Martin:2006ub}. This requires iteration to \ndetermine the gluino pole mass, and hence is slower than simply evaluating the self-energy functions with \nthe lagrangian mass parameters, but the accuracy of the calculation is improved \nsignificantly~\\cite{Martin:2006ub}.  \nTypically, 4 to 6 iterations are required to reach the \ndefault tolerance of less than 1 part in $10^5$ difference between\nsuccessive iterations for the gluino pole mass.\nThis iteration is not the bottleneck in the calculation, as we find that the CPU time\nspent on the squark masses is about twice that spent on the gluino mass, even with 6 iterations for the latter. \nWe did not implement this improvement for the squarks since the effect is less \nsignificant, and the necessary iterations would be much slower.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Kinky Masses\\label{subsec:kinky}}\nIn implementing these 2-loop pole masses, we encountered an interesting issue that\ndoes not seem to have been noted before, as far as we know. Consider the self-energy\nand pole mass of a particle $Z$ that has a three-point coupling to particles $X$ and $Y$.\nLet the tree-level squared masses of these particles by $z$, $x$, and $y$ respectively.\nIf $z$ happens to be close to the threshold value \n$(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2$, then the computed 2-loop complex pole mass of $Z$ will have \na singularity proportional to\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n1/\\sqrt{-\\delta - i \\epsilon}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is infinitesimal and positive, and\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nz = (\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2 (1 + \\delta).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe reason for this can be understood from the sequence of\nFeynman diagrams shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:kinks}. After reduction to basis integrals,\nthe result of Figure~\\ref{fig:kinks}(b) contains terms proportional to $V(x,y,u,v)$ and\n$B(x,y')$, in the notation of refs.~\\cite{Martin:2003qz,Martin:2005qm}. (Here the prime represents a derivative with respect \nto the corresponding argument, and the external momentum invariant is $s=z$.)\n\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=12.0cm,angle=0]{kink_fig.eps}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:kinks}\nFeynman diagrams for the self-energy of a particle that couples to\ntwo lighter particles. The dark blobs in (b) and (c) represent 1-loop subdiagrams.\nNear threshold, diagrams (b) and (c) have $1/(-\\delta)^{1/2}$ and $1/(-\\delta)^{3/2}$\nsingularities, respectively, where $s = (\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2(1 + \\delta)$, with\n$x$ and $y$ the squared masses of the internal particles.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThen, for example, one can evaluate:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nB(x,y') \\Big |_{s = (\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y})^2(1 + \\delta)} &=&\n-\\frac{\\pi (x/y)^{1/4}}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2 \\sqrt{-\\delta - i \\epsilon}}\n+ \\ldots~.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe have found that in general such singularities do not cancel within the fixed-order\n2-loop pole mass\ncalculation. This includes e.g.\\ the pole mass of the gluino, where we checked that there are singularities in the pole mass as one varies the top mass and one of the stop masses very close to the 2-body decay threshold. \nSimilarly, there are singularities in the 2-loop pole masses of the top squarks, \nin each case when the top mass and the gluino happen to be very close to the 2-body decay thresholds. \nWe have also checked that this behavior occurs\nin a simple toy model involving only three massive scalar particles. \n\nThis singular behavior might be quite surprising, because the pole mass is\nsupposed to be an observable, and therefore ought to be free of divergences of any kind.\nThe resolution is that, similar to problems with infrared divergences, the singularity\nis an artifact of truncating perturbation theory. The 3-loop diagram of\nFigure~\\ref{fig:kinks}(c) will diverge  \nlike $1/(-\\delta)^{3/2}$, and similar diagrams of loop order \n$L$ will diverge like $1/(-\\delta)^{L-3/2}$. \nThese contributions can presumably be resummed to \ngive a result that is well-behaved as $\\delta \\rightarrow 0$, although proving\nthat is beyond the \nscope of the present paper.\n\nThe above singularity behavior is not tied to the presence \nof massless gauge bosons. However, if massless gauge bosons are present, \nthen there is another, less severe, type of singular threshold behavior, due to \nthe Feynman diagram shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:kinks2}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!tb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=4.0cm,angle=0]{kink_fig2.eps}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:kinks2}\nFeynman diagram for the self-energy of a particle that couples to\ntwo lighter particles, each of which couples to a massless gauge boson. \nNear threshold, this diagram has a $\\ln(-\\delta)$ singularity, where \n$s = (\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2(1 + \\delta)$, with\n$x$ and $y$ the squared masses of the internal particles.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn the notation of refs.~\\cite{Martin:2003qz,Martin:2005qm}, \nthis arises due to the near-threshold dependence of the corresponding \nself-energy basis integral:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nM(x,x,y,y,0) \\Big |_{s = (\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y})^2(1 + \\delta)} &=&\n-\\frac{2\\pi^2}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2} \\ln(-\\delta - i \\epsilon)\n+ \\ldots~.\n\\end{eqnarray} \nAgain, the singularity in the computed 2-loop pole mass\nis an artifact of the truncation of perturbation theory, and would presumably be removed\nby a resummation including all diagrams with $2,3,4,\\ldots$ massless gauge bosons exchanged between particles $X$ and $Y$.\n\nNote that it requires some bad luck to encounter any of these threshold \nsingularity problems in \npractice, as there is\nno good reason why the tree-level masses should be tuned to the high \nprecision necessary to make the problem numerically significant. Nevertheless, it could\nlead to a small\\footnote{Note that \n(before smoothing by the interpolation method adopted here) \nthis kink in the 2-loop computed pole mass is \nactually infinitely large as $\\delta\\rightarrow 0$, but in practice it is confined to a \nsmall region, because of the 2-loop suppression factor. Therefore, it would usually appear to be finite in any scan with reasonable increments in masses.} \n``kink\" in the computed pole mass if one performs a scan over models by varying the \ninput masses.
