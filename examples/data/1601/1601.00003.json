Every massive galaxy is now thought to contain a central\nsupermassive black hole that can undergo periods of rapid gas\naccretion to produce an AGN. The accretion activity of AGN may also\nhave a strong\ninterplay with star formation. Indirect evidence for this comes from comparisons made\nbetween the evolution of AGN activity and the star-formation rate of\nthe Universe, which have been shown to follow each other over cosmic history\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Franceshini1999}. In the local Universe more evidence comes\nfrom the correlation between the black hole and bulge masses of\ngalaxies \\citep{Kormendy1995, Magorrian1998}. \nAlthough more recent results have shown this relationship deviates\nfrom being linear when probing lower masses \\citep{Graham2015}, the\nrelationship for more massive galaxies is thought to arise from\nthe regulation of star formation in the bulge due\nto `AGN feedback' \\citep [for a review see][]{Fabian2012}. AGN feedback has also been incorporated into\nsemi-analytical models \\citep{Croton2006, Bower2006}, as a way to\nquench star formation and produce the observed colour bimodality of\ngalaxies \\citep{Strateva2001, Baldry2004}.  \n \nThe radio source population probed by the current generation of radio surveys probes a mixture of\ngalaxies powered by star-formation and AGN activity. At 1.4~GHz flux densities of $\\sim 10$ mJy and\nabove, the majority of radio sources are radio-loud AGN. Below $10$~mJy \nthere is an increasing number of star-forming galaxies \\citep{Condon1989}. \\citet{Fanaroff1974} found that radio-loud\nAGN could be subdivided into two types (known as Fanaroff-Riley\n(FR) types I and II), based on their radio morphologies, which were\nfound to show a division at approximately $L_{\\rm{178-MHz}} =10^{25}$\nW~Hz$^{-1}$. Those having brighter cores and diffuse lobes are labelled as \nFR I sources and those with highly collimated jets,\nwhich produce `hot-spots' of high surface brightness at their edges, as FR IIs.    \n\nA different classification system based on the presence or absence of\nnarrow emission lines in the optical spectra of radio-loud AGN has also been used over\nthe years \\citep {Hine1979, Laing1994, Jackson1997,\n  Willott2001}. Those with high-excitation emission lines\nbeing referred to as High Excitation Radio Galaxies (HERGs) and those\nwithout as Low Excitation Radio Galaxies (LERGs). HERGs are the\ndominant population above $L_{\\rm{1.4-GHz}}=10^{26}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$ \\citep{Best2012} and are more likely\nto be associated with the more powerful FR~II sources, compared to the\nLERGs which are more associated with FR~Is (although not exclusively).\nThe dichotomy in these populations is believed to be due to two\ndifferent modes of accretion, with the LERG population undergoing\nradiatively inefficient accretion of hot gas from the galaxies'\ninterstellar medium and surrounding galaxies, and the HERG\npopulation undergoing radiatively efficient accretion of cold gas by\nmergers and interactions between the host galaxy and gas rich\nsystems \\citep{Allen2006, Evans2006, Hardcastle2007, Smol2009, Heckman2014, Fernandes2015}. Both accretion\nmodes are thought to be important processes in the AGN feedback\nmechanism. In order to fully understand these different mechanisms,\nthe evolution of these populations has to be determined, usually\nconducted by either a\n$V/V_{\\rm max}$ analysis or by producing radio luminosity functions,\nwhose evolution is parametrized in some way. \n\nIt is now established that the most powerful\nradio-loud AGN (with $L_{\\rm{1.4-GHz}} > 10^{25}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$)\nevolve strongly over the course of cosmic history, with studies\nfinding an increase in their number densities by a factor of 1000 from\n$z \\sim 0 - 2$ \\citep{Longair1966,Laing1983, Dunlop1990, Willott2001}, which then\ndeclines beyond $z \\sim 3$ \\citep{Shaver1996, Jarvis2000, Jarvis2001,Wall2005,Rigby2011}.\nAt lower luminosities, however, the picture is much more uncertain.\n\nIn an early study by \\cite{Laing1983}, observations at 178 MHz\nconducted as part of the 3CRR survey, revealed that sources with\n$L_{\\rm{178-MHz}}<10^{26}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$ exhibit no evolution via a $V/V_{\\rm max}$ analysis.    \n\\cite{Jackson1999} also found little or no evolution in the FR I population,\ncompared to FR IIs at frequencies of 151 MHz. The trend that \nlow luminosity sources ($L < 10^{25}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$) evolve much less than\nhigher luminosity sources was also seen by \n\\cite{Waddington2001}. At 325 MHz, \\cite{Clewley2004} found no significant\nevolution for sources with $L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} < 10^{26.1}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$~sr$^{-1}$ out to\n$z=0.8$, from matching radio data from the Westerbork Northern Sky\nSurvey \\citep[WENSS;][]{Rengelink1997} with optical SDSS\nDR1 data and performing a $V/V_{\\rm max}$ analysis.\n\nThese results are in contrast to those of \\cite{Brown2001} who found strong\nevolution in the low luminosity radio population at 1.4 GHz out to $z =0.55$, and\nby assuming pure luminosity density evolution of the form $L \\propto\n(1+z)^{k}$ found $ 3 < k < 5$ for AGN with $10^{23} < L_{\\rm{1.4-GHz}} < 10^{25}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$.\n\\cite{Sadler2007} also found significant evolution for AGN with\n$10^{24} < L_{\\rm{1.4-GHz}} < 10^{25}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$\nconsistent with pure luminosity evolution where $L \\propto\n(1+z)^{2.0 \\pm 0.3}$ from $z = 0.7$, using the 2SLAQ \\citep{Cannon2006} catalogue combined with \nFaint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters\n\\citep[FIRST,][]{Becker1995} and NRAO VLA Sky Survey\n\\citep[NVSS,][]{Condon1998}.\n\nMore recent studies, probing fainter fluxes, have found milder evolution in\nlow-luminosity AGN. \\cite{Smol2009} produced 1.4 GHz luminosity functions\nusing the VLA-COSMOS survey for AGN with $10^{21} < L_{\\rm{1.4-GHz}} < 10^{26}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$ to $z =1.3$\nand found modest evolution, with $L \\propto (1 + z)^{0.8 \\pm 0.1}$, or $\\Phi \\propto (1 + z)^{1.1 \\pm 0.1}$,\nassuming pure luminosity and density evolution respectively.\n\n\\cite{McAlpine2011} found that low-luminosity sources evolve\ndifferently from their high-luminosity counterparts out to a redshift\nof $ z = 0.8$ and the measured radio luminosity function was found to be consistent with an\nincrease in the comoving space density of low-luminosity sources by a\nfactor of 1.5.\n\n\\cite{Simpson2012} using deep $S_{\\rm 1.4} > 100~\\mu$Jy radio imaging in the Suburu/{\\it XMM-Newton\nDeep Field}, produced 1.4 GHz luminosity functions divided into the radio-loud and\nradio-quiet AGN populations. They found that radio-quiet population\nevolves more strongly than the radio-loud population. Again very little or no evolution in the\nnumber density of the radio-loud AGN with $L_{\\rm{1.4-GHz}} \\le 10^{24} $ W~Hz$^{-1}$\nout to $z = 1.5$ was observed.\n\nUsing 1.4 GHz VLA data combined with\nphotometric redshifts from the VIDEO survey, \\cite{McAlpine2013} found that AGN evolve as \n$L\\propto (1 + z)^{1.18 \\pm 0.21}$ at relatively low radio luminosities,\nassuming pure luminosity evolution. \n\nFinally, using deep from deep ($\\sim 30 \\mu $Jy) 1.4 GHz VLA observations of the {\\it Chandra} Deep\n  Field South (CDFS) \\cite{Padovani2015} find that the number density of\n  radio loud AGN evolves as $\\propto (1+z)^{2}$ out to $z = 0.5$,\n  after which it declines steeply as $\\propto (1+z)^{-4}$.     \n\nAs well as tracing the population of AGN, radio emission is produced\nfrom electrons in the H{\\sc ii} regions near massive stars (free-free emission)\nand cosmic ray electrons produced by supernova remnants (synchrotron emission), and offers\na probe of recent star-formation in galaxies without the need for an uncertain extinction correction\n\\citep{Condon1992}.    \nIt has become well established that the star-formation\nrate of the Universe has declined by a factor of $\\sim 10$, from $z=1.0$ to\n$z=0.0$ \\citep{Lilly1996, Madau1996, Hopkins2006, Madau2014}. Studies such as\n\\cite{Hopkins2004} for example, \nincorporated 1.4~GHz measurements into a compilation of star-formation\nindicators to show that the star-formation rate in galaxies evolves\nas $L \\propto (1 + z)^{2.7 \\pm 0.6}$ for pure luminosity evolution and $\\phi \\propto (1 + z)^{0.15 \\pm 0.6}$ for density\nevolution. \\cite{Padovani2011} also found that star forming galaxies evolve as $L \\propto (1+z)^{2.89 \\pm 0.1}$, out to $z =2.3$, at\n$1.4$ GHz using VLA observations of the {\\it Chandra} Deep Field South\n(CDFS). More recently, \\cite{McAlpine2013} measured the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity\nfunction of star-forming galaxies, from VLA data combined with\nphotometric redshifts from the VIDEO survey. They measured evolution in the star-formation rate density \nas $L \\propto (1+ z)^{2.47 \\pm 0.12}$ out to $z =1$.           \n\nIn this paper we present a measurement of the evolution of\nradio-loud AGN and star forming galaxies to $z = 0.5$, by matching a catalogue of\nradio sources measured at a frequency of 325 MHz from the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to their optical counterparts in the\nGalaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. The 325~MHz GMRT survey is the deepest\navailable to date, over a sky area significant enough to alleviate the effects of cosmic\nvariance. The GAMA survey provides reliable spectroscopic redshifts, allowing\nus to spectroscopically classify AGN and star-forming galaxies, in\naddition to providing more accurate redshift and luminosity estimates than studies using\nphotometric redshifts. At present, studies of the evolution in the radio source population\nmade from samples selected at frequencies below 1.4~GHz have primarily relied on radio data\nwith a relatively shallow flux density limit and on photometric\nredshifts in the optical \\citep[e.g.][]{Clewley2004}.\nRadio-loud AGN samples selected at lower radio frequencies are of interest\nbecause the detected population is less dependent on the orientations of the jets.\nThe steep-spectrum lobes of radio galaxies dominate at lower radio frequencies, \nwhereas in the GHz regime the doppler boosted flat-spectrum cores of\npole-on sources are more likely to be detected \\citep{Jarvis2002}.\n\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Section~2 we outline the\nGAMA survey and the GMRT data used in this study. In Section~3 we\nexplain the technique to match the radio sources to their optical\ncounterparts. In Section~4 we describe the way we have classified AGN\nand star forming galaxies. In Section~5 we highlight some of the sample\nproperties and show how the spectral indices of the sources vary as a function of luminosity and redshift.\n In Section~6 we present our radio luminosity functions, and determine\n the evolution in low-luminosity radio sources. We go on to produce\n RLFs for the HERG and LERG populations, and RLFs for AGN\nwith steep and flat spectral indices. In Section~7 we compare our results to\nother studies. Finally in Section~8 we summarise our main results.\n\nThroughout this paper we assume $H_{0} = 70\\,{\\rm km s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm\n  Mpc}^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{m} = 0.3$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.7$. \n                  \n\\section{Data}\n\n\\subsection{Galaxy And Mass Assembly} \n\nGAMA is a multi-wavelength (far-UV to radio) survey of $\\sim 290\\,000$\ngalaxies selected to be complete to $r = 19.8$ mag, combining photometry and spectroscopy from the latest wide-field\nsurvey facilities \\citep{Driver2009, Driver2011, Liske2015}. Covering $\\sim 290$\ndeg$^{2}$ and probing galaxies to $z \\sim 0.5$, GAMA allows the study of\ngalaxies and cosmology on scales between 1 kpc\n and 1 Mpc and provides\nthe link between wide-shallow surveys, such as the SDSS Main Galaxy\nSample \\citep[SDSS MGS]{Strauss2002} and 2dFGRS \\citep{Colless2001},\nand narrow-deep surveys such as DEEP2 \\citep{Davis2003}, $z$COSMOS\n\\citep{Lilly2007} and VVDS\n\\citep{LeFevre2005}.\n\nOptical spectroscopy for the GAMA survey was conducted at the 3.9-m\nAnglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) using the AAOmega spectrograph\n\\citep{Sharp2006} on 210 nights, over 6\nyears, between January 2008 and September 2014. For further details about spectroscopic\n target selection and the tiling strategy used for GAMA, the reader is\nreferred to \\cite{Baldry2010} and \\cite{Robotham2010} respectively. In\nbrief, galaxies are selected for spectroscopy using an input catalogue\ndrawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7\n\\citep{SDSSDR7} and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDDS)\n\\citep{Lawrence2007}. Raw spectra are reduced and calibrated using a\npipeline described in \\cite{Hopkins2013}. \n GAMA makes extensive use of SDSS photometry, which is obtained for five broad-band filters ({\\it ugriz})\n using a dedicated 2.5-m telescope at Apache Point, New Mexico,\n equipped with a mosaic CCD camera \\citep{Gunn1998} and calibrated with a 0.5-m telescope\n \\citep{Hogg2001}. For greater detail regarding the SDSS the reader is\n referred to \\cite{York2000} and \\cite{Stoughton2002}. \n\nIn the following analysis we use imaging data for galaxies which make up the\n{\\it r}-band limited Main Survey, observed in three $12 \\times 5$ deg$^{2}$\nGAMA fields located along the celestial equator at 9h, 12h and 14.5h\n(known as G09, G12 and G15). In order to measure the radio luminosity\nfunction and its evolution, we select galaxies from GAMA TilingCat43 with redshifts\nbetween $0.002 < z < 0.6$, $nQ \\ge 3$, $r \\le 19.8$ mag and a Survey Class $\\ge 4$ which ensures\nwe are using reliable redshifts and have a well defined selection\nlimit in which we are $>98$ per cent complete. This results in a\nsample of $185,125$ galaxies over G09, G12 and G15.     \n\n\\subsection{GMRT data}\n\nThe 325~MHz radio survey covering the GAMA fields, using the Giant\nMeterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT), is fully described in\n\\cite{Mauch2013}\\footnote{See also: http://www.extragalactic.info/mjh/gmrt/}. A total of 212, 15 minute pointings were observed over 8 nights in January 2009, 3 nights in May\n2010 and 1 night in June 2010. These pointings overlap with 138 deg$^{2}$\nof the GAMA G09, G12 and G15 regions. Flagging, calibration, self-calibration and\nsource detection of each pointing was conducted using a pipeline making\nuse of the AIPS software package. After reduction, the pointings in each field were\nmosaiced, producing images with resolutions of $14''$, $15''$ and $23.5''$ with \nminimum rms noises of $\\sim$ 0.8 mJy beam$^{-1}$, $\\sim$ 1 mJy beam$^{-1}$\nand $\\sim$ 1.5 mJy beam$^{-1}$, for fields G09,\nG12 and G15, respectively. A source catalogue was produced by fitting\nelliptical Gaussians in the mosaics, which resulted in a final\ncatalogue that contains $5,264$ sources. \nTo remove spurious detections, we limited the GMRT catalogue to include only sources brighter than\n5$\\sigma$ (Peak flux density/local RMS $\\ge 5$), resulting in a catalogue of $4\\,931$ radio\nsources.  \n\n\\section{GAMA/GMRT Cross-Matching}\n\nCross-matching between the GAMA and the GMRT\ncatalogues was conducted by visual inspection of radio contours onto optical images.\nThis was done because the elliptical Gaussian model fitted to GMRT radio sources \nis insufficient to describe the wide range of source morphologies at the resolution of the\nsurvey and the Gaussian fits are also sometimes affected by image artefacts. Automated cross-matching \nof the catalogues based on position separation will be unable to take account of these errors. \nWe treat the cross-matching of single and multiple component radio sources\nseparately, where radio sources within a\nradius of $50''$ of each other are considered as being potential multiple component\nsources. Sources with no other radio source within $50''$ are treated as single component\nsources. Using this method we are considering every potential\n  optical counterpart from GAMA within $50''$ of a GMRT radio source.       \n\n\\subsection{Single Component Sources}\n\nThere are $3\\,616$ single component radio sources (i.e. sources with no other radio source within $50''$) in the GMRT catalogue. \nIn order to find optical counterparts, each radio source is matched to the nearest object in\nthe selected GAMA spectroscopic catalogue with a maximum offset of $15''$. \nContour maps of each GMRT source were then produced and\noverlaid on top of a $3'\\times 3'$ SDSS $r$-band images of the\npotential counterpart, and inspected to establish whether the radio source has a robust optical counterpart. \nVisual inspection was performed by two of us to ensure its reliability.\nAs a double-check to ensure \nthe GMRT indentifications were real, contour maps from the 1.4 GHz surveys FIRST\nand NVSS, where available, were also overlaid on the SDSS image. The FIRST and NVSS contours complement the GMRT data when matching, \nas FIRST provides resolved ($6.4''\\times5.4''$ resolution in the GAMA regions) detections of the sources and\nthe NVSS, despite its lower resolution of $45''$, has greater surface brightness\nsensitivity.\n \nOf the $3\\,616$ single component sources, we found $573$ lie within $15''$\nof a GAMA source in the selected spectroscopic catalogue. \nWe then visually matched $370$ out of these GMRT sources with their optical counterparts in GAMA.\n\nFor comparison, we also looked for single component counterparts using the likelihood ratio technique \n\\citep{Sutherland1992, Smith2011, McAlpine2012}. This resulted in $330$ GAMA/GMRT matches with\nreliabilities $> 0.8$. This method resulted in fewer matches overall, mainly due to the non-trivial structure of many radio\nsources at the GMRT resolution \\citep[e.g.][]{McAlpine2012}, so\nwe use our visually classified sample for the rest of this\npaper. At present visual classifcation is acknowledged as being the most reliable\nmethod of cross matching radio source catalogues with optical datasets \\citep[e.g.][]{Fan2015}.\n\n\\subsection{Multiple Component Sources}\n\nTo find the counterparts of multiple component sources (i.e. radio sources with a radio counterpart within $50''$), \nGMRT contour maps of all radio sources were again overlaid with FIRST and NVSS contours, on top of a $5' \\times\n5'$ SDSS $r$-band image of the nearest GAMA object. Visual inspection of candidate multiple component radio sources\nwas performed in the same way as was done for single component sources.\n\nFrom the initial GMRT catalogue of $4\\,931$ $5\\sigma$ radio source components, we\nfound $757$ potential multiple component sources.  \nAfter inspection we identified $84$ multiple component radio sources,\ntogether with a further $46$ objects that turned out to\nbe separate single component sources near unrelated GMRT\nsources that could not be matched (bringing the total number of single component\nsources to $414$).\nThe flux densities of multiple component objects are simply the sum\nof the flux density of each individual component in the GMRT\ncatalogue. \n\nFigure~\\ref{GRG} shows an example of one of the GAMA/GMRT matches, \nGAMAJ085701.76+013130.9, with the SDSS\n$r$-band image overlaid with radio contours from\nthe GMRT (blue), FIRST (yellow) and NVSS (red). At $z =0.27$ this\ngalaxy has a projected size of $\\sim 1.3$ Mpc and is a previously\nundiscovered Giant Radio Galaxy \\citep[GRG;][]{Schoenmakers2001,\n  Saripalli2005}. Automated methods such as the likelihood ratio technique in this case would be able to match the\ncore of the radio source to an optical counterpart, but would\nincorrectly match the lobes to some other optical source, if considered separately.   \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics*[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure1.eps}\n\\caption{An example of one of the GMRT/GAMA matches\n  GAMAJ085701.76+013130.9, showing the SDSS $r$-band image, overlaid with radio contours from\n  the GMRT (blue), FIRST (yellow) and NVSS (red). At z = 0.27, the\n  FR II AGN has a projected size of 1.3 Mpc, making it a previously undiscovered giant radio\n  galaxy (GRG).}\n\\label{GRG}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Positional Offsets}\n\nFigure~\\ref{OFFSETS} shows the positional offsets between the\nGAMA and GMRT positions of the $414$ single component sources. The median\npositional offset between the coordinates is found to be $1.51^{\\prime\\prime}$.    \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics*[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure2.eps}\n\\caption{The positional offsets between the GAMA and GMRT for the 414 single\n  component matches out to z =0.6. The circular line represents a radius of $15''$.}\n\\label{OFFSETS}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo test our matching process, in Figure~\\ref{OFFSET2}\nwe show the distribution of the positional offsets between each of the $185,125$ GAMA\nsources and the $4,931$ GMRT sources (blue dashed line). Here, this is compared to the positional offsets\nbetween the mean of $10$ GAMA catalogues with randomised positions and\nagain matched to the nearest GMRT source (black solid line).\nThe curves converge at a separation of $15''$, which implies that genuine GMRT/GAMA matches should all lie\nwith $15''$ of one another.\n\nIntegrating both curves out to $15''$, yields $778$ matches between the real GAMA/GMRT catalogues\nand $267$ matches between the random/GMRT catalogue which indicates\n$511$ genuine GAMA/GMRT matches\nare expected, which is consistent with our final sample of $499$ ($414$ single and $84$ multiple component) \nGAMA/GMRT matches.\n\nWe find that $\\sim 10$ per cent ($499$/$4931$) of the radio sources\nare matched to GAMA. This is a higher fraction than other matched\nradio/optical samples with similar radio flux density limits, for\nexample \\cite{Sadler2002} and \\cite{Mauch2007} find that $\\sim 1$--$2$\nper cent of NVSS radio sources are detected in the 2dFGRS and 6 degree Field\nGalaxy Survey \\citep[6dFGS][]{Jones2004}. This is due to the fainter\noptical limits of GAMA, which probes a larger range of redshifts.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics*[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure3.eps}\n\\caption{Histogram displaying the positional offset between each of\n  the $185,125$ GAMA sources in the spectroscopic catalogue, with $z < 0.6$\nand $nQ \\ge 3$ and $r \\le 19.8$, matched to the nearest of the $4,931$ $5\\sigma$ GMRT\nsources within $3'$ (blue dashed line). This is compared to the positional offsets\nbetween the mean of $10$ random GAMA catalogues matched to the nearest GMRT source (black solid line).}\n\\label{OFFSET2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Source Classification}\n\nAfter matching the optical/radio counterparts, we divided our sample into\nAGN and star-forming (SF) galaxies, by inspecting their individual optical spectra, in a similar\nfashion to \\cite{Sadler2002} and \\cite{Mauch2007}. AGN can have\nspectra with either pure absorption features like that of an\nelliptical galaxy, broadened emission features (known as Type I AGN),\nstrong nebular emission [O{\\sc ii}], [O{\\sc iii}] and [N{\\sc ii}] lines compared to the\nBalmer series (known as Type II AGN), or spectra with absorption lines\nwith weak narrow emission lines (LINERS). In this work, sources with optical spectra\nrevealing strong narrow emission lines consistent with H{\\sc ii}\nregions, were classified as being star-forming galaxies. Examples of\nspectra for AGN and star-forming galaxies can be seen in Figure~\\ref{EXAMPLESPEC}. \nThe spectrum for each object was inspected independently by three people to ensure that each\nclassification was reliable and subsequently double-checked with the AGN/SF \\cite{Kewley2001} classifications, if it was available in GAMA's emission line\ncatalogue.     \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\subfloat[AGN with pure absorption features.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{figure4a.eps}} \\\\\n\\subfloat[AGN with broadened emission lines.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{figure4b.eps}} \\\\\n\\subfloat[Star forming galaxy.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{figure4c.eps}} \\\\\n\\caption{Example optical spectra found in our GAMA/GMRT matched\n  sample (black lines).

Upon further inspection, one source, GAMA\nJ142831.94+014331.4, was found serendipitously to be an F5 type radio star in the catalogue of\n\\cite{Kimball2009}. \n\n\\section{Sample properties}\n\nEach source in our GAMA/GMRT catalogue was detected by the NVSS and we\nassigned an NVSS identifcation (and $1.4$ GHz flux density)\nduring the visual cross-matching process.\nIn order to determine radio luminosities of each object, we\nk-correct the observed flux densities assuming $S_{\\nu} \\propto\n\\nu^{\\alpha}$ and use spectral indices\ndetermined from the ratios between the 325 MHz and 1.4 GHz fluxes\nretrieved from the NVSS catalogue.     \n\nMedian redshifts were found to be $z = 0.36$ for the AGN, and $z=0.06$ for the star forming\ngalaxies. In Figure~\\ref{Fig2} and Figure~\\ref{Fig3} we show the\nredshift distribution histogram and the\nredshift versus radio luminosity plane respectively, for both the AGN and star-forming\ngalaxies. These figures illustrate that star forming galaxies become the\ndominant population of radio sources in the local Universe ($z < 0.1$)\nat the limit of $\\sim 10$ mJy at 325 MHz.\n\n\\subsection{Spectral Indices}\n\nGiven that every $325$ MHz GMRT source has a detection at $1.4$ GHz\nfrom the NVSS, we can investigate the spectral index distribution for both star-forming galaxies and AGN.\nFigure~\\ref{SpectralInd} shows the distribution of the spectral\nindices across the whole sample. We find that the median spectral indices for AGN and star\nforming galaxies\nare $\\alpha = -0.68 \\pm 0.22$  and\n$\\alpha = -0.82 \\pm 0.28$ respectively, which agree well with values\nreported by \\cite{Mauch2003}, \\cite{Owen2009}, \\cite{Mauch2013},\n\\cite{Randall2012}, \\cite{Smol2014} and \\cite{Coppejans2015}.\n\nFigure~\\ref{SpecZ} shows how the spectral indices of AGN and star\nforming galaxies vary as a\nfunction of redshift. In the past, steep spectral indices have been\nused to select high-redshift radio galaxy candidates from\nlow-frequency radio surveys\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Jarvis2001,DeBreuck2001,Cruz2006}, however we find that there is no significant steepening of the\nspectral index in our sample with redshift, albeit over a relatively\nlow redshift range. This trend was also found by\n\\cite{Smol2014} out to $z =2.5$, in a 325 MHz VLA survey of the COSMOS\nfield.    \n\n In Figure~\\ref{SPECLUM}, we show the spectral indices as a function of luminosity. Although there is large scatter in the data,\n we find there is a slight decrease in spectral index with increasing\n luminosity for the AGN. This decrease may arise due to an increasing contribution from higher\nluminosity FR II sources whose emission will be dominated by\nsteep-spectrum optically-thin lobes. A\nstraight line of best fit to the AGN datapoints yields a gradient of\n$m = -0.077 \\pm 0.022$ and constant of $c =1.23 \\pm 0.55$. A Spearman\nRank correlation test gives a coefficient of $\\rho = -0.229$ with a\nsignificance of the deviation from zero of $1.02 \\times 10^{-6}$,\nindicating a weak but significant correlation. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure5.eps}\n\\caption{Redshift distribution of GAMA-GMRT\n  matched AGN (solid red line)\n and star forming galaxies (dashed blue line).

The sample is truncated at $z < 0.1$ to\nminimise the effects of evolution. The shape of the RLF is broadly\nconsistent with the local RLF of \\cite{Mauch2007} converted to $325$\nMHz from $1.4$ GHz assuming a spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.7$.\nOne key difference between these surveys is the short baseline coverage that allows\nextended sources to be recovered in the study of\n\\cite{Mauch2007}, whereas such sources may be missed in the GMRT\nsurvey. We therefore may not be sensitive to such extended sources,\nand our measured RLF should be treated as a lower limit.\n\nAssuming synchrotron self-absorption becomes important in star forming\ngalaxies, at lower frequencies we would expect a population of flatter spectrum\nsources to shift the median spectral index above $\\alpha = -0.7$. In\nFigure~\\ref{SPECLUM} we see no significant population of flat spectrum\nsources in the star forming population, which, assuming sychrotron\nself absorption means we are likely to be missing sources in the flux\ndensity range of the SF galaxies. These may be missing due to\nresolution bias; i.e. they have a peak flux density below the survey\nlimit, but their total flux density would be above the limit, if they\nwere detected. This may even be occuring at the relatively\nlow-resolution and surface brightness sensitivity of the GMRT data.\n\nNo evolution measurement is possible from our data, as only six star forming galaxies are detected above $z = 0.1$, with\nthe majority actually at $z< 0.1$ (Figure~\\ref{Fig2}). It is evident we are missing the faintest star forming\ngalaxies with $\\log_{10} L_{325} < 22.0$. To rectify this, deeper\nradio data with $\\mu$Jy flux limits, over the same area of sky, would\nbe needed to further constrain the faint-end of the luminosity function at frequencies of 325 MHz. Indeed this is one of the key\nscience cases for current and future deep radio surveys covering much\nsmaller areas \\citep{Jarvis2014a,McAlpine2015}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\caption{The $325$ MHz Radio Luminosity Function for star forming galaxies.}\n\\label{TableSFValues}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline\n Luminosity & Number Density & Number \\\\\n ($\\log_{10} (L_{325-\\rm{MHz}})$)  & (${\\rm Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}}$) & \\\\\n\\hline\n$22.15$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}   $2.72^{+2.22}_{-1.32} \\times 10^{-4}$  &  $4$ \\\\    \n$22.55$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}   $1.00^{+2.11}_{-0.81}  \\times 10^{-3}$  &  $7$ \\\\  \n$22.95$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}  $6.10^{+2.36}_{-1.76} \\times 10^{-5}$  &  $14$ \\\\\n$23.35$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}  $1.63^{+0.73}_{-0.53}  \\times 10^{-5}$  &  $10$ \\\\\n$23.75$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}   $2.09^{+2.75}_{-1.35}  \\times 10^{-6}$  &  $2$ \\\\\n$24.15$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}  $1.86^{+4.26}_{-1.54} \\times 10^{-6}$  &  $1$ \\\\\n\\hline \nTotal & &  38 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table} \n\nWith these caveats in mind we can derive a lower limit of the local\nstar-formation rate density, using the 1.4 GHz luminosities of the galaxies and converting them to star formation\nrates (in M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) via the relation presented in\n\\cite{Bell2003}, we estimate the total star formation rate density as $\n\\rho_{\\rm SFR} =\\Sigma ({\\rm SFR}/V_{\\rm max})  = 0.013  \\pm 0.002$ M$_\\odot$\n  yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. \n\nMany different estimators have been used to determine the star\nformation rate density of the Universe.

The sample is truncated at $z < 0.1$ to\nminimise the effects of evolution. The shape of the RLF is broadly\nconsistent with the local RLF of \\cite{Mauch2007} converted to $325$\nMHz from $1.4$ GHz assuming a spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.7$.\nOne key difference between these surveys is the short baseline coverage that allows\nextended sources to be recovered in the study of\n\\cite{Mauch2007}, whereas such sources may be missed in the GMRT\nsurvey. We therefore may not be sensitive to such extended sources,\nand our measured RLF should be treated as a lower limit.\n\nAssuming synchrotron self-absorption becomes important in star forming\ngalaxies, at lower frequencies we would expect a population of flatter spectrum\nsources to shift the median spectral index above $\\alpha = -0.7$. In\nFigure~\\ref{SPECLUM} we see no significant population of flat spectrum\nsources in the star forming population, which, assuming sychrotron\nself absorption means we are likely to be missing sources in the flux\ndensity range of the SF galaxies. These may be missing due to\nresolution bias; i.e. they have a peak flux density below the survey\nlimit, but their total flux density would be above the limit, if they\nwere detected. This may even be occuring at the relatively\nlow-resolution and surface brightness sensitivity of the GMRT data.\n\nNo evolution measurement is possible from our data, as only six star forming galaxies are detected above $z = 0.1$, with\nthe majority actually at $z< 0.1$ (Figure~\\ref{Fig2}). It is evident we are missing the faintest star forming\ngalaxies with $\\log_{10} L_{325} < 22.0$. To rectify this, deeper\nradio data with $\\mu$Jy flux limits, over the same area of sky, would\nbe needed to further constrain the faint-end of the luminosity function at frequencies of 325 MHz. Indeed this is one of the key\nscience cases for current and future deep radio surveys covering much\nsmaller areas \\citep{Jarvis2014a,McAlpine2015}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\caption{The $325$ MHz Radio Luminosity Function for star forming galaxies.}\n\\label{TableSFValues}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline\n Luminosity & Number Density & Number \\\\\n ($\\log_{10} (L_{325-\\rm{MHz}})$)  & (${\\rm Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1}}$) & \\\\\n\\hline\n$22.15$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}   $2.72^{+2.22}_{-1.32} \\times 10^{-4}$  &  $4$ \\\\    \n$22.55$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}   $1.00^{+2.11}_{-0.81}  \\times 10^{-3}$  &  $7$ \\\\  \n$22.95$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}  $6.10^{+2.36}_{-1.76} \\times 10^{-5}$  &  $14$ \\\\\n$23.35$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}  $1.63^{+0.73}_{-0.53}  \\times 10^{-5}$  &  $10$ \\\\\n$23.75$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}   $2.09^{+2.75}_{-1.35}  \\times 10^{-6}$  &  $2$ \\\\\n$24.15$  &{\\rule{0pt}{2.6ex}}{\\rule[-1.6ex]{0pt}{0pt}}  $1.86^{+4.26}_{-1.54} \\times 10^{-6}$  &  $1$ \\\\\n\\hline \nTotal & &  38 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table} \n\nWith these caveats in mind we can derive a lower limit of the local\nstar-formation rate density, using the 1.4 GHz luminosities of the galaxies and converting them to star formation\nrates (in M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) via the relation presented in\n\\cite{Bell2003}, we estimate the total star formation rate density as $\n\\rho_{\\rm SFR} =\\Sigma ({\\rm SFR}/V_{\\rm max})  = 0.013  \\pm 0.002$ M$_\\odot$\n  yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. \n\nMany different estimators have been used to determine the star\nformation rate density of the Universe.

Using H$\\alpha$ measurements \\cite{Gunawardhana2013}\nhave also estimated the evolution of the star formation density out to\n$z < 0.34$.

Stronger evolution is found for both scenarios, when fitting the whole range of\nluminosities, which indicates that lower luminosity\nsources undergo less evolution than\nhigher luminosity sources $\\log_{10}L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} > 24.5$ W~Hz$^{-1}$ a trend\nwhich has been seen by \\cite{Waddington2001, Willott2001, Tasse2008, Donoso2009, Rigby2011, Simpson2012}. \n\nTo investigate this further, we follow \\cite{Clewley2004} and\ncalculate the parameter free $V/V_{\\rm max}$ statistic as a function\nthe radio luminosity. The $V$ in this case is the volume enclosed by\nthe source at its true redshift and $V_{\\rm max}$ is the volume up to\nwhich it could still be found given the survey parameters, i.e. the\nsame $V_{\\rm max}$ used to calculate the RLF. For a non-evolving\npopulation, then the radio sources should be uniformly distributed\nbetween 0 and 1 for this statistic, resulting in a constant co-moving\npopulation giving a value of $V/V_{\\rm max} = 0.5$, whereas a\nnegatively evolving population would give $V/V_{\\rm max} < 0.5$ and a\npositively evolving population resulting in $V/V_{\\rm max} >\n0.5$.

At the faintest luminosities it is possible that we don't\n  see evolution due to the lack of volume probed.

As in \\cite{Laing1994} and \\cite{Best2012} we make use\nof the $5007 \\AA$  [OIII] line to divide the HERG and LERG populations. Here we\ndefine HERGs as those as having a measurable [OIII]\nequivalent widths (EW) $> 5 \\AA$, which results in a sample of 68 HERGs and 382 LERGs.  \n\nFigure ~\\ref{HERGLERG} shows the RLFs for HERGs and LERGs in two\nredshift slices $0.002  < z < 0.25$ and $0.25 < z < 0.5$, compared to\nthe local $1.4$ GHz HERG and LERG RLFs of \\cite{Best2012}\nconverted to 325 MHz, assuming a spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.7$.  \nA clear division between the HERG and LERG RLFs can be seen, at luminosities between $\n10^{23} < L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} < 10^{26}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$, and the LERGs are the\ndominant population. We calculate that the fraction of HERGs decreases from $0.3$ between $0.002 < z\n< 0.25$ to $0.21$ between $0.25 < z < 0.5$. The faint end and bright ends of the RLFs tend to\nconverge.  Comparing our results with those of \\cite{Best2012} we find\nthat the LERG RLFs agree well with each other, whereas the HERG RLFs tends to diverge at lower\nluminosities $L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} < 10^{24}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$.    \n\nAs our sample size is small we are unable to observe any\nevolution. Pracy et al. (submitted) will contain a detailed\ninvestigation of the evolution of HERGs and LERGs at 1.4 GHz, making\nuse of GAMA redshifts, as well as a discussion of the divergence of\nthe HERG RLFs at lower luminosities.     \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure15.eps}\n\\caption{Radio Luminosity Functions for high (red datapoints)\n  and low (black datapoints) excitation\nAGN in two redshift slices $0.002\n  < z < 0.25$ (filled circles) and $0.25 < z < 0.5$ (stars). The\n  local 1.4 GHz HERG and LERG RLFs (converted to $325$ MHz using a\n  spectral indices of $\\alpha = -0.7$) of Best and Heckman 2012, can be\n  seen as the red dashed and black dotted lines respectively.}\n\\label{HERGLERG}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Steep and Flat Spectrum AGN}\nIn the simplest form of the orientation-based unification\nof AGN, we expect the flat-spectrum sources to be a subset of\nthe parent steep-spectrum population that happen to have their radio\njets oriented along our line of sight \\citep{Urry1995}. These\nflat-spectrum sources would therefore have their radio flux density\nboosted due to relativistic beaming effects, and their intrinsic\nluminosity could be significantly lower than observed.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the 325 MHz data is that we have spectral\nindices for the entire sample of radio-loud AGN, therefore we are able to\nmeasure separable RLFs for AGN with steep ($\\alpha < -0.5$) and flat\n($\\alpha > -0.5$) spectra. \nFigure~\\ref{AGNDIFF} shows the RLFs for the\ntwo populations for two different redshift slices; $0.002 < z < 0.25$ and\n$0.25  < z < 0.5$. The steep spectrum sources are seen to be more numerous \nand span a wider range of luminosities than the flat spectrum sources\nin our sample. \n\nIn order to determine whether the flat-spectrum objects are indeed a subset of the\nsteep-spectrum sources, or conversely, we assume that they are and derive\nbeaming parameters, to estimate the shift that is required on the\nflat-spectrum RLF for it to sit on the steep-spectrum RLF.\n\nThe radio flux density is enhanced as $\\Gamma^2$:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": " \n\n\\noindent and in pure luminosity evolution:\n\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\log_{10}\\Phi_{z} = m(\\log_{10}(L) -  k\\log_{10}(1+z)) + c .\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\log_{10}\\Phi_{z}=m(\\log_{10}(L)-k\\log_{10}(1+z))+c.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>z</mi></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>L</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00003.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $\\beta = v/c$ and $\\theta$ is\nthe angle between the radio jet and the line of sight. Following\n\\cite{Jarvis2002}, we adopt a conservative approach and assume that the flat-spectrum population have an\nopening angle of $\\theta \\sim 20^{\\circ}$, which suggests a flux-boosting\nfactor of the order of 10-20 over the steep-spectrum population. Furthermore, given the opening angle of\n$20^{\\circ}$ we can calculate the fraction of the parent population we\nare observing as flat-spectrum. Assuming a spherically symmetric\nsystem, then an opening angle of 20$^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a\nfraction of 6 per cent of the parent population, from which we infer\nthat the measured space density is a factor of $\\sim 16$ lower than\nit would be if we could see the un-boosted population. To check\nif this is consistent with the RLF of the steep-spectrum sources we\nshift the flat-spectrum RLF by a factor of 10 in luminosity,\nand a factor 16-20 in number density. Figure ~\\ref{FLATSTEEP} shows that this extrapolation of\nthe steep-spectrum RLF (seen in grey) does indeed agree with the shifted RLF of the\nflat-spectrum population, as would be expected from orientation-based\nunification of radio-loud AGN. However, we have assumed that all of the flux from\nthe flat-spectrum sources is Doppler boosted, whereas in reality some\nflux is undoubtedly  emitted by extended jets or lobes which are not\nassociated with the core of the radio sources. As such our result that\nthe flat-spectrum population forms a subset of the steep-spectrum\npopulation is only an indication \nthat the orientation-based unification of radio-loud AGN is consistent\nwith the data, rather than confirmation.\n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure16.eps}\n\\caption{Radio Luminosity functions of AGN with steep ($\\alpha <\n  -0.5$, red) and flat ($\\alpha > -0.5$, blue) spectral indices, for two redshift slices $0.002\n  < z < 0.25$ (solid lines) and $0.25 < z < 0.5$ (dashed lines)}. \n\\label{AGNDIFF}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure17.eps}\n\\caption{Figure showing that the RLF (in the redshift slice $0.002 < z < 0.25$) for flat-spectrum sources\n  (blue line) can be shifted in number density and luminosity (grey region), to incide with an extrapolation of\n  the steep-spectrum sources (red), as is expected from the orientation based unification of radio-loud AGN.}\n\\label{FLATSTEEP}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nThe results presented use data from a deep and wide 325 MHz\nsurvey from \\cite{Mauch2013}, combined with the optical imaging and\nspectroscopic redshifts from the GAMA survey. This sample is the\nlargest using spectroscopic redshifts obtained to date that spans a significant enough range in\nredshift ($0.002 < z <0.5$) to measure evolution.  \n\n We find that the 325 MHz RLF for star-forming galaxies, at $z < 0.1$, is in agreement with those produced by\ncombining 1.4 GHz NVSS and optical data from the 6dFGRS\n\\citep{Mauch2007}. In order to determine a radio derived estimate of the evolution of star formation\nrate density from the GAMA survey, we would\nrequire much deeper GMRT data going to lower flux limits.\n\\cite{Padovani2011} for instance found that star-forming galaxies\nevolve as $L \\propto (1+z)^{2.8}$, using 1.4 GHz data to flux\nlimits of $50$ $\\mu$Jy from the VLA-CDFS survey.   \n Using 1.4 GHz VLA data matched to the VIDEO survey\n\\cite{McAlpine2013}, found that the RLF of star-forming galaxies\nevolves as $L \\propto (1+z)^{2.5}$, which is consistent with many other tracers of star formation\n\\citep{Hopkins2003, Hopkins2004, Prescott2009}.      \n\nOur measured 325~MHz RLF of AGN is in broad agreement with the 1.4~GHz\nRLF measued by \\citep{Mauch2007} when converted to 325~MHz using a\nspectral index of $\\alpha=-0.7$. The \\cite{Mauch2007} LF also\n  consistent with the local 20 GHz LF of \\cite{Sadler2014}, it therefore appears\nthat the local AGN population is remarkably uniform over a large range in\nfrequency (325 MHz to 20 GHz). \n\n We note that, at the faint end, the\n1.4~GHz RLF is consitently higher than our 325~MHz RLF, assuming the\nspectral index correction. The increased space density\nof 1.4 GHz selected galaxies may be due to doppler boosting of the\npopulation, whereby beamed 1.4~GHz sources are shifted to higher\nluminosity. Radio-loud AGN samples selected at lower frequency are not\nas likely to detect significant numbers of sources with beamed\ncores, as at lower frequency the lobes of galaxies should\ndominate. This implies that the 325 MHz LFs presented here are\n  not biased with respect to orientation and are more representative\n  of the mechanical jet power in the local radio-loud AGN population. \n\nRegarding evolution, we detect mild but poorly constrained evolution\nfrom fits to the 325 MHz RLF for AGN out to\n $z =0.5$, with evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \\pm 0.95$ for pure density evolution \nand $k = 2.13 \\pm 1.96$ for pure luminosity evolution. Considering\njust the low-luminosity population (those with $L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} <\n25.5$ W~Hz$^{-1}$) the evolution appears to be much less.   \nThis is in line with previous studies (see Table~\\ref{Table3}), principally based on smaller\nsamples from deep fields, where the low-luminosity population evolves\nsignificantly less strongly that the high-luminosity population. \nOur results are also consistent with \\cite{Donoso2009} and\n  although they did not estimate an evolution parameter, they\n  found that the number density of low-luminosity AGN increases by\n  a factor of $\\sim 1.5$, out to $z =0.55$, which implies an evolution\n  parameter of $k \\sim 0.93$.     \n\nLow-luminosity sources are thought to be the population that\ndominates the mechanical feedback in the $z< 1$ Universe\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Croton2006,Smol2009, Smol2009b, Best2012, Smol2015}, and thus constraining their evolution is\nkey to our understanding of the relevance of such feedback in studies\nof galaxy evolution. However, we note that some fraction of such\nsources are thought to be powered by the efficient accretion of cold gas,\ndetermined by their emission-line properties \\citep[e.g.][]{Simpson2012,Best2014,Mingo2014}.\n\nHistorically the vast majority of continuum surveys that have produced RLFs have been\nconducted at 1.4 GHz. Our result is in agreement with the only other comparable study\n concerned with the evolution of radio sources at 325 MHz by\n \\cite{Clewley2004}, who by matching SDSS DR1 data with the Westerbork\n Northern Sky Survey (WENSS), found no evolution in low-luminosity AGN via a $V/V_{\\rm max}$ analysis, out to $z =0.8$. \n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of the evolution parameters for radio-loud AGN determined from previous\n  studies discussed above.}\n\\label{Table3}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\n\\hline\nStudy  & Frequency & Flux Limit & $z$ Range & Sample Size &\nEvolution Parameter $k$ &Redshifts \\\\\n\\hline\nThis study & 325 MHz  & $\\sim 5$ mJy  & $0.0 < z < 0.5$ & $428$ & $ 2.13\n\\pm 1.96 $ PLE & spectro \\\\\n& & & & & $0.92 \\pm 0.95$  PDE \\\\ \n\\cite{Brown2001} & 1.4 GHz & $5$ mJy & $0.0 < z < 0.4$ & $230$ & $3 - 5$ PLE & photo\\\\ \n\\cite{Sadler2007} & 1.4 GHz & $2.8$ mJy  & $0.0 <  z < 0.7$ & $391$ & $2.3\n\\pm 0.3$ PLE & spectro\\\\ \n\\cite{Smol2009} & 1.4 GHz & $50$ $\\mu$Jy & $0.0 < z < 1.3$ & $601$ &\n$2.0 \\pm 0.3$ PLE & combined\\\\\n\\cite{McAlpine2011} & 1.4 GHz & $1$ mJy & $0.0 <\nz<0.8$& $131$ & $0.8 \\pm 0.2$ PLE & photo\\\\\n &  & & &  & $0.6 \\pm 0.1$ PDE & \\\\\n\\cite{Padovani2011} & 1.4 GHz & $50$ $\\mu$Jy & $0.1 <\nz < 5.8$& $86$ & $-3.0 \\pm 1.0$ PLE & combined \\\\\n &  &  & &  & $-1.6 \\pm 0.4$ PDE & \\\\\n\\cite{McAlpine2013} & 1.4 GHz & $100  \\mu$Jy  & $0 < z < 2.5$  & $951$\n& $1.18 \\pm 0.21$ PLE & photo\\\\\n\\cite{Padovani2015} & 1.4 GHz & $50$ $\\mu$Jy & $0.1 <\nz < 4.5$& $136$ & $-6.0 \\pm 1.4$ PLE & combined \\\\\n&  &  & &  & $-2.4 \\pm 0.3$ PDE & \\\\\n\n\\hline \n\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*} \n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have produced $1/V_{\\rm max}$ radio luminosity functions for samples of AGN and star forming\ngalaxies out to $z \\sim 0.5$, by combining data from the largest survey conducted to date at\n325 MHz from the GMRT, with the GAMA survey. Our main results are as follows:  \n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item By cross-matching a 325 MHz GMRT survey covering\n  $138$ deg$^{2}$ of the GAMA spectroscopic survey, we are able to\n  produce a GMRT/GAMA matched sample of $499$ objects with $z \\le 0.6$, $nQ \\ge 3$ and $r \\le\n  19.8$. Inspection of the optical spectra in our sample allows us to\n  divide the sample into $45$ star forming galaxies and $453$ AGN.  \n\n\\item  The mean spectral index of AGN remains constant with redshift as found in \\cite{Smol2014}\n  (Fig.~\\ref{SpecZ}). Higher luminosity AGN are found to have slightly steeper spectral\n  indices than those with lower luminosities possibly due to the\n  increase in fraction of FR II sources (Fig.~\\ref{SPECLUM}).   \n\n\\item We determine the local luminosity function of star forming\n  galaxies at 325 MHz, which is broadly consistent with the local 1.4 GHz luminosity function of\n  \\cite{Mauch2007} converted to $325$ MHz assuming spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.7$. We estimate that the lower limit on the local star formation\n  rate density of the Universe is $\\rho_{SFR} = 0.013  \\pm 0.002$ M$_\\odot$\n  yr$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ (Fig.~\\ref{SFLF1}).           \n\n\\item We determine RLFs of radio-loud AGN for two redshift\n  slices. Fitting a double power mild evolution out to $z \\sim 0.5$. Parametrizing the evolution as $\\propto\n  (1+z)^{k}$, we find a best fitting values $k = 0.92 \\pm 0.95$\n  assuming pure number density and $2.13\n  \\pm 1.96$ assuming the pure luminosity density (Fig.~\\ref{AGNEvolve}). From fitting\n  single power law functions to the RLFs we show that low-luminosity\n  sources evolve less than high-luminosity sources.    \n\n\\item We produce RLFs for the HERG and LERG populations of AGN. LERGs\n  are the dominant population at luminosities between $\n10^{23} < L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} < 10^{26}$. At higher luminosities the\nspace densities of the populations become comparable (Fig.~\\ref{HERGLERG}). \n\n\\item After dividing the AGN sample into steep and flat-spectrum\n  sources, we show that the extrapolation of the steep-spectrum\n  sources agrees with the shifted flat-spectrum, as expected from the\n  orientation-based unification of radio-loud AGN (Fig.~ \\ref{FLATSTEEP}).    \n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nIn order to fully understand the link between AGN-driven feedback and\nthe shutting down or continuous quenching of star formation in\ngalaxies, a full understanding of the link between radio power,\naccretion mode and environment as a function of redshift is\nrequired.\nIn the near future radio data obtained from the LOw-Frequency ARray\n\\citep[LOFAR;][]{VanHaarlem2013}, the Australian Square Kilometre\nArray Pathfinder \\citep[ASKAP;][]{Johnston2007} and MeerKAT\n\\citep{Jonas2009}, along with the VLA, will provide much greater\nsample sizes for AGN and star forming galaxies\nallowing more stringent constraints on the evolution of the radio\npopulation, out to greater redshifts when combined\nwith future spectroscopic surveys \\citep[e.g.][]{Smith2015}.     \nEventually, the Square Kilometre Array will be used to study the evolution of AGN from the cosmic dawn \\citep{Smol2015}.     \nFurther work using the GAMA data set will involve investigating the evolution of HERG\nand LERG populations of AGN at $1.4$ GHz (Pracy et al. (submitted)).    \n\n\\section {Acknowledgements}\n\nMP, TM, KM, MJ, RJ and SF acknowledge support by the South African Square Kilometre Array\nProject and the South African National Research Foundation.\n\nGAMA is a joint European-Australasian project based\naround a spectroscopic campaign using the Anglo-\nAustralian Telescope.

Stronger evolution is found for both scenarios, when fitting the whole range of\nluminosities, which indicates that lower luminosity\nsources undergo less evolution than\nhigher luminosity sources $\\log_{10}L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} > 24.5$ W~Hz$^{-1}$ a trend\nwhich has been seen by \\cite{Waddington2001, Willott2001, Tasse2008, Donoso2009, Rigby2011, Simpson2012}. \n\nTo investigate this further, we follow \\cite{Clewley2004} and\ncalculate the parameter free $V/V_{\\rm max}$ statistic as a function\nthe radio luminosity. The $V$ in this case is the volume enclosed by\nthe source at its true redshift and $V_{\\rm max}$ is the volume up to\nwhich it could still be found given the survey parameters, i.e. the\nsame $V_{\\rm max}$ used to calculate the RLF. For a non-evolving\npopulation, then the radio sources should be uniformly distributed\nbetween 0 and 1 for this statistic, resulting in a constant co-moving\npopulation giving a value of $V/V_{\\rm max} = 0.5$, whereas a\nnegatively evolving population would give $V/V_{\\rm max} < 0.5$ and a\npositively evolving population resulting in $V/V_{\\rm max} >\n0.5$. Figure~\\ref{VVmax} shows the  $V/V_{\\rm max}$ statistic for our\nsample, at radio luminosities $L_{\\rm{325 MHz}} < 10^{25}$~W~Hz$^{-1}$ the population does not appear to be\n  evolving, whilst at $L_{\\rm{325 MHz}} > 10^{25}$~W~Hz$^{-1}$ there appears to be some evidence for positive\n  evolution. At the faintest luminosities it is possible that we don't\n  see evolution due to the lack of volume probed. This is similar to what was found by \\cite{Clewley2004} albeit with a\nradio survey with a higher flux limit, and using photometric\nredshifts. \\cite{Tasse2008} also show there is more positive\n  evolution for radio loud AGN with $L_{\\rm{1.4-GHz}} >\n  10^{24.5}$~W~Hz$^{-1}$ than at lower lumonisities, consistent with\n  the results here, using a sample of AGN observed at frequencies\n  of $74$, $230$, $325$ and $610$ MHz using the VLA and GMRT in the XMM-LSS field.  \n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Straight line of best fit parameters for the 325 MHz RLF\n  assuming pure luminosity and pure density evolution for the whole\n  range of luminosities and for AGN with $\\log_{10}L_{325} < 25.5$ W~Hz$^{-1}$.}\n\\label{Table3}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{5}{c}{Evolution Scenario} \\\\\nParameter  & PDE & PLE &PDE ($\\log_{10}L_{325} < 25.5$ W~Hz$^{-1}$) &PLE ($\\log_{10}L_{325} < 25.5$ W~Hz$^{-1}$) \\\\\n\\hline \n$m$   & $-0.53 \\pm 0.05$  & $-0.56 \\pm 0.04$  & $-0.44 \\pm 0.06$  & $-0.43 \\pm 0.06$ \\\\ \n$c$    & $ 7.28 \\pm 1.18 $  &  $8.26 \\pm 1.06$   &  $5.21 \\pm 1.46$ &  $5.02 \\pm 1.43$ \\\\\n$k$  & $1.46 \\pm 0.93 $ &  $3.04 \\pm 1.48$   &  $0.81 \\pm 1.01$   &$1.66 \\pm 2.13$\\\\                               \n\\hline\nReduced $\\chi^{2}$ & $1.53$ & $2.34$ & $0.97$ & $1.03$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*} \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure13a.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure13b.eps}\n\\caption{$325$ MHz AGN radio luminosity functions for the\n  redshift ranges $0.002 < z < 0.25$ (red crosses) and $0.25 < z <\n  0.5$ (black filled circles).

As in \\cite{Laing1994} and \\cite{Best2012} we make use\nof the $5007 \\AA$  [OIII] line to divide the HERG and LERG populations. Here we\ndefine HERGs as those as having a measurable [OIII]\nequivalent widths (EW) $> 5 \\AA$, which results in a sample of 68 HERGs and 382 LERGs.  \n\nFigure ~\\ref{HERGLERG} shows the RLFs for HERGs and LERGs in two\nredshift slices $0.002  < z < 0.25$ and $0.25 < z < 0.5$, compared to\nthe local $1.4$ GHz HERG and LERG RLFs of \\cite{Best2012}\nconverted to 325 MHz, assuming a spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.7$.  \nA clear division between the HERG and LERG RLFs can be seen, at luminosities between $\n10^{23} < L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} < 10^{26}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$, and the LERGs are the\ndominant population. We calculate that the fraction of HERGs decreases from $0.3$ between $0.002 < z\n< 0.25$ to $0.21$ between $0.25 < z < 0.5$. The faint end and bright ends of the RLFs tend to\nconverge.  Comparing our results with those of \\cite{Best2012} we find\nthat the LERG RLFs agree well with each other, whereas the HERG RLFs tends to diverge at lower\nluminosities $L_{\\rm{325-MHz}} < 10^{24}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$.    \n\nAs our sample size is small we are unable to observe any\nevolution. Pracy et al. (submitted) will contain a detailed\ninvestigation of the evolution of HERGs and LERGs at 1.4 GHz, making\nuse of GAMA redshifts, as well as a discussion of the divergence of\nthe HERG RLFs at lower luminosities.     \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.47\\textwidth]{figure15.eps}\n\\caption{Radio Luminosity Functions for high (red datapoints)\n  and low (black datapoints) excitation\nAGN in two redshift slices $0.002\n  < z < 0.25$ (filled circles) and $0.25 < z < 0.5$ (stars). The\n  local 1.4 GHz HERG and LERG RLFs (converted to $325$ MHz using a\n  spectral indices of $\\alpha = -0.7$) of Best and Heckman 2012, can be\n  seen as the red dashed and black dotted lines respectively.}\n\\label{HERGLERG}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Steep and Flat Spectrum AGN}\nIn the simplest form of the orientation-based unification\nof AGN, we expect the flat-spectrum sources to be a subset of\nthe parent steep-spectrum population that happen to have their radio\njets oriented along our line of sight \\citep{Urry1995}. These\nflat-spectrum sources would therefore have their radio flux density\nboosted due to relativistic beaming effects, and their intrinsic\nluminosity could be significantly lower than observed.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the 325 MHz data is that we have spectral\nindices for the entire sample of radio-loud AGN, therefore we are able to\nmeasure separable RLFs for AGN with steep ($\\alpha < -0.5$) and flat\n($\\alpha > -0.5$) spectra. \nFigure~\\ref{AGNDIFF} shows the RLFs for the\ntwo populations for two different redshift slices; $0.002 < z < 0.25$ and\n$0.25  < z < 0.5$. The steep spectrum sources are seen to be more numerous \nand span a wider range of luminosities than the flat spectrum sources\nin our sample. \n\nIn order to determine whether the flat-spectrum objects are indeed a subset of the\nsteep-spectrum sources, or conversely, we assume that they are and derive\nbeaming parameters, to estimate the shift that is required on the\nflat-spectrum RLF for it to sit on the steep-spectrum RLF.\n\nThe radio flux density is enhanced as $\\Gamma^2$:\n\n", "index": 19, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Gamma = \\gamma^{-1} (1 - \\beta\\cos\\theta)^{-1},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Gamma=\\gamma^{-1}(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)^{-1},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msup><mi>\u03b3</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
