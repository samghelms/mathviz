Fig.~\\ref{Fig2}a).\nThese patterns are  induced by a spatial filtering in the Fourier plane (cf. FP in Fig.~\\ref{Fig1}).  Actually, through a slit, \nwe can filter spatial modes and break the rotational symmetry. In this way, we forced the system just to present \nroll-patterns in a given direction. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{2.pdf} \n\\caption{Spatial textures in LCLV with optical feedback at different voltage $V_0$.

The width of this peak is due to temperature fluctuations and \ndynamics of defects such as dislocations and boundary grains.

In many physical systems,\nthese structures are stationary and emerge as a spatial instability of a uniform state\nwhen a control parameter is changed and surpasses a critical\nvalue, which usually corresponds to imbalances of forces.\nAs the parameters of the system are changed, stationary patterns can become \nunstable and bifurcate to more\ncomplex patterns, even into aperiodic dynamics states \n\\cite{Nicolis,DefectMediated,GorenEckmannProcaccia}.  \nThis behavior is characterized by complex spatiotemporal dynamics exhibited by the \npattern and a continuous coupling between spatial modes in time. \nComplex spatiotemporal dynamics  of patterns have been observed, for example, \nin fluids \\cite{Bodenschatz,Miranda,Limat}, chemical reaction-diffusion systems \\cite{Flesselles}, \ncardiac fibrillation \\cite{Weiss}, electroconvection \\cite{Zhou}, fluidized granular matter \\cite{Moon},  \nnonlinear optical cavities \\cite{Arecchi90,Huyet,Tredicce96,Mamaev98} and in a liquid crystal light valve  \\cite{VBCR2013}.\nIn most of these studies, complex behaviors are characterized by spatial and temporal \nFourier transforms, wave vector distribution, \nfiltering spatiotemporal diagrams, power spectrum of spatial mode, \nlength distributions, Poincar\\'e maps and number of defects as a function of the parameters.\nHowever, in these experimental studies, spatiotemporal complexity has not been characterized using rigorous tools of \ndynamical systems theory as Lyapunov exponents \\cite{Manneville90}. \nThese exponents characterize the exponential sensitivity \nof the dynamical behaviors under study and in turn gives a characteristic time scale on which one has \nthe ability to predict the time evolution of the system. When the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE)\nis positive (negative) the system under study is chaotic (stationary).\nIndeed, from experimental data in spatial extended systems, \nit is a difficult task to infer the value of Lyapunov exponents. \n\n\n\n{\\it Experimental details.--} \nA flexible optical experimental setup that exhibits pattern formation is the liquid crystal light valve (LCLV)\nwith an optical feedback (see Fig.~\\ref{Fig1})~\\cite{ResidoriReport}. \nThe LCLV is illuminated by an expanded and collimated He-Ne laser beam, $\\lambda=633 \\:nm$, \n with $3$~cm transverse diameter and power $I_{in}=6.5$ mW/cm$^2$, linearly polarized along the vertical axis. \n Once shone into the LCLV, the beam is reflected by the dielectric mirror \ndeposed on the rear part of the cell and, thus, sent to the polarizing cube. Due to the phase-change the light suffers in the reflection, \nthe polarizing cube will send the  reflected light into the feedback loop. To close the feedback \n loop, a mirror and an optical fiber bundle  are used, these elements \n assure the light to reach the photoconductor placed in the back part of the LCLV. \nIn the feedback loop, a 4-f array is placed in order to obtain a self-imaging \nconfiguration and access to the Fourier plane, this array is constructed \nwith 2 identical lenses  with focal length $f=25~cm$ placed in such a way \nthat both sides of the LCLV are conjugated planes. We filter the Fourier plane in order to force the system to exhibit roll-patterns in a given direction.\nThanks to this configuration the free propagation length in the feedback loop \ncan be easily adjusted. For the performed experiments an optical equivalent length of $d=-4$~cm was used.\nA spatial light modulator (SLM) was placed in the input beam optical path with a $1:1$ imaging between \nthe SLM and the frontal part of the LCLV.    \nWith the aid of a specialized software, a square mask was produced and sent to the \nSLM. The SLM and the polarizing cube combination allow to impose an arbitrary shape \nto the input beam.  \nFor a uniform mask  of 160 gray-value, the typical input intensity would be \n$I_{w}=0.83\\:mW/cm^2$. To obtain the shape used in the experiments, \none and two-dimensional masks, $I(x,y)$, were created and, by means of these masks, one and two dimensional patterns \ncan be obtained as can be seen in the bottom left part of Fig.~\\ref{Fig1}. \nThe system dynamics is controlled by adjusting the external voltage $V_0$ \napplied to the LCLV.\n\nThe dynamics exhibited by the LCLV with optical feedback is characterized by the changes that \nmolecular orientation induces in the phase of the reflected light  \nwhich in its turn---optical feedback---produces a voltage that \nreorients the liquid crystal molecules. \n\n\\noindent{\\it From stationary to disordered dynamics.--} The presented dynamics in the LCLV \nhave been explored in two different configurations, the first one using an intensity \nmask of zero-level intensity everywhere except for a central square part with length $a_0=2.5$ mm (2-D \nmask), and the second one with a zero-level intensity except on a narrow channel of 150 $\\mu$m width and $2.5$ mm\nlength (1-D mask). \nThe injected intensity  is spatially modulated as $I_{in}=I_0(x,y)$, where $I_0$  can be controlled by changing the mask created \nin the SLM, and\n $\\{x, y\\}$ are the transverse coordinates of the sample. $I_0$ \nis measured when imposing a given gray-value to the illuminated area, that is, for the 2-D mask\n", "index": 1, "text":

LLEs correspond to equilibrium with invariant directions, \nsuch as periodic or quasi-periodic solutions and non-chaotic attractors \n\\cite{Ott2002}. Therefore, the LLE is an exceptional order parameter for characterizing  \ntransitions from stationary to complex spatiotemporal dynamics.\n\n Experimentally, to estimate the LLE,  it is  mandatory to have two close initial conditions\nand observe if their evolution diverge at large times. \nThe implemented method needs, as a first step,  to find two close fields \n(see lines 1 and 2 in Figs.~\\ref{Fig4}a and  \\ref{Fig4}b) \nalong the projected  spatiotemporal \ndiagrams and compute their difference $\\Delta_0$.

The stars correspond to the calculated \nLLE while the circles show the normalized mean intensity present in the LCLV. \nThe insets correspond to phase space reconstruction in the respective parameters.}\n\\label{Fig5}       \n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA bifurcation diagram was constructed with the obtained LLEs as can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{Fig5}. \nThe system starts with stationary stripe patterns at $V_0=3.0\\:V_{rms}$ and the dynamics remains unchanged until the \napplied voltage reached $V_0=3.5\\:V_{rms}$. At  this voltage, the LLE goes to zero, meaning that the system exhibits a bifurcation.\nExperimentally, we observed that the steady pattern changes to an aperiodic \nregime. The chaotic behavior remains until \nthe mean intensity in the LCLV \ndestroys  the chaotic attractor due to destructive interference at $V_0=3.9\\:V_{rms}$ (see \nFig.~\\ref{Fig5}), \ncausing a crisis. Once the light is recovered, the system enters in an intermittent regime between \nchaos and quasi-periodicity. After this window the system \nbecomes chaotic until the attractor is annihilated by destructive interference  at $V_0=5.35 \\:V_{rms}$. Once the light is recovered the \nsystem remains in a quasi-periodic regime until the next cycle of destructive interference arrives.   \nThis dynamic regime is characterized by having an oscillatory pattern which LLE is zero.\n\nGiven a temporal signal, the attractor of the system can be built by taking the signal \nat different periodic times (arbitrary periodic separation $\\tau$)  and constructing the vector \n$(I(x,t),I(x,t+\\tau,x),I(x,t+2\\tau),\\cdots)$\nwith $x$ as a fixed position, {\\it phase space \nreconstruction} \\cite{Abarbanel}. \nBottom panels of  Fig.~\\ref{Fig5} show three different attractors projected in three dimensions using this embedding method.\nFor low voltage a fixed point can be seen, \nthis behavior is observed when the stationary pattern is displayed in the LCLV.\nThe Points dispersion accounts for the inherent fluctuations of the system. Increasing the tension $V_0$, the phase space \nreconstruction exhibits a\ntorus,  which accounts for the quasi-periodic behavior observed \nat $V_0=4.65\\:V_{rms}$. For larger voltage,\nthe phase space reconstruction exhibits a strange attractor.\n\n\n Our study provides clear evidence that the LCLV with optical feedback is\nspatiotemporally chaotic in a certain range of parameters. The LLEs are experimentally accessible and allow us\nto characterize  the transitions from stationary to complex spatiotemporal dynamics.\nUsing the LLEs, one can reconcile the theory with experimental \nobservations.\n Certainly new concepts in the theory of dynamical systems must be developed to achieve a better experimental characterization of spatiotemporal complex behaviors. Notwithstanding, the LLE and power spectrum allow distinguishing well-established dynamical behaviors such as turbulence and spatiotemporal chaos, \nwhich are often merged and confuse.\n\n\\noindent {\\it Acknowledgements.} MGC and MW acknowledge the support of FONDECYT N$^{\\circ} 1150507$ and N$^{\\circ} 3140387$ respectively. \nVO acknowledges the support of the 'R\\'egion Nord-Pas-de-Calais'.\n\n\\bigskip\n\n\n$^{\\dagger}$Present address: Universit\\'e Lille1, Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers, Atomes et\nMol\\'ecules, CNRS UMR8523, 59655 Villeneuve d'Ascq Cedex, France\n\n\\begin{references}\n\n\\bibitem{Arecchi90}  Arecchi, F.

The alternating voltage  $V_0$ has been varied between $3$ and $7$ $V_{rms}$, \nat a constant frequency $f_0=5\\:kHz$,\n starting with the appearance of stationary roll-patterns.\nFor different $V_0$ values, the dynamical behavior obtained \nin the system was recorded with a CCD  camera.\nFigure~\\ref{Fig2} shows the spatiotemporal \nevolution of the observed patterns in one and two dimensions, respectively. \nThis evolution is characterized by projected \nspatiotemporal diagrams,  which are constructed, in the 2-D experiments, \nby picking an arbitrary line---transversal to the \nrolls \ndirection---in the illuminated zone and superposing it as time evolves; \nin the 1-D experiments this  construction is simpler, is enough to superpose the pattern as the time evolves. \nThe system exhibits stationary  stripe patterns (cf. Fig.~\\ref{Fig2}a).\nThese patterns are  induced by a spatial filtering in the Fourier plane (cf. FP in Fig.~\\ref{Fig1}).  Actually, through a slit, \nwe can filter spatial modes and break the rotational symmetry. In this way, we forced the system just to present \nroll-patterns in a given direction. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{2.pdf} \n\\caption{Spatial textures in LCLV with optical feedback at different voltage $V_0$.

Hence, this kind of dynamical \nbehavior could be expected.\nThe complex dynamics exhibited by this pattern \nis constantly repeated over time. Which leads us to infer that this kind of behavior \ncould be quasi-periodicity.\n\n \nFurther increasing $V_0$, the dynamics shown by the pattern becomes \nmore and more complex (cf. Fig.~\\ref{Fig2}c).\nClearly, in the projected spatiotemporal diagram, we detected an intermittent behavior. \nThat is, the pattern exhibits aperiodic oscillations invaded by large fluctuations, generating several \nspatial and temporal dislocations. Likewise, the system exhibits a high spatiotemporal complexity. \nThis kind of disorder is usually associated to spatiotemporal chaotic textures\n\\cite{Nicolis1995,Verschueren2013,Bodenschatz2002}.\nFigure \\ref{Fig2}d shows a 3-D spatiotemporal diagram, \nfrom this diagram it is clear that an arbitrarily chosen line represents the dynamics. \n\n\nA mathematical tool for analyze the spatial modes interaction is the Fourier spectrum.\nFigure \\ref{Fig3} shows the Fourier spectra of  different dynamical regimes. Showing that the \ndynamics changes between stripe patterns, quasi-periodicity and spatiotemporal chaotic textures. \nThe stationary pattern is characterized \nby a dominant wavelength $f$. The width of this peak is due to temperature fluctuations and \ndynamics of defects such as dislocations and boundary grains. The quasi periodic texture is characterized by the \nappearance of   incommensurable wavelengths, $\\{f',f'''\\}$, with respect to the main wavelength $f''$ and its harmonics. \nThe spatiotemporal  chaotic texture is characterized by presenting an enlarged spectrum \nas a result of the interaction between the  main  incommensurable modes \\cite{Kuramoto84}. \nNote that in this regime, the modes are coupled with \nexponential decay (see the dashed line in Fig.~\\ref{Fig3}). Therefore, \nthe system does not exhibit power spectrum behavior which is the hallmark \nof turbulence dynamics \\cite{Frisch}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{3.pdf} \n\\caption{Fourier spectra for three different dynamical regimes.
