On the other hand, the increase in resistivity upon applying a positive gate voltage suggests that pinned Fe moments act as scattering centers. We characterized our SLB heterostructure as well, and found that the MR curves after applying gate voltages with different polarities show a small change in $H_{C}$ and $H_{Eb}$, and almost no change in the sheet resistivity (see Fig.~\\ref{Fig:MR}b). Comparing the MR curves of the two stacks, one notices that the SLB heterostructure exhibits lower coercive field and sheet resistance than the SBL heterostructure, indicating a more conductive LSMO associated with less pinned Fe moments at the interface in the SLB heterostructure in agreement with the tendency observed for SBL heterostructure. \n\nIn order to understand the results from MR measurements, the heterostructures were further characterized by SQUID after field cooling from 380\\,K under applied magnetic fields of $\\pm$10\\,kOe.

Upon field cooling under -10\\,kOe field, a positive shift of 200\\,Oe leads to $H_{Eb}$ of 340\\,Oe. Comparing the MR curves and hysteresis loops of both stack sequences (Fig.~\\ref{Fig:MR}a,b and Fig.~\\ref{Fig:SQUID}a), it is obvious that the SBL heterostructure exhibits a higher $H_{C}$ and exchange bias can only be detected in this stack sequence. We observed the same $H_{C}$ and $H_{Eb}$ in the MR curves of $\\pm$10\\,kOe field cooled SBL heterostructures (thicknesses of BFO and LSMO were 50 and 7\\,nm, respectively)\\,\\cite{S1}.\n\nMoreover, concerning the hysteresis loops, the saturation magnetization ($M_S$) decreases from 3.7\\,$\\mu_B$/f.u. for the single LSMO layer to approximately 2.6 and 0.8\\,$\\mu_B$/f.u. for the SLB and SBL heterostructures, respectively. The reason is likely to be due to the crystal quality of the LSMO layer. Rocking curve measurements on LSMO (002) and BFO (002) reflections (not shown here) reveal a full width at the half maximum (FWHM) of 0.08$^{\\circ}$ and 0.21$^{\\circ}$ for the SLB and 0.29$^{\\circ}$ and 0.45$^{\\circ}$ for the SBL, respectively. This means that, the amount of defects in the LSMO within the SLB heterostructure is lower than the one within the SBL giving a higher volume fraction with long range magnetic order contributing to the saturation magnetization. Note that the magnetization is normalized to the volume of a formula unit. The lower crystal quality of BFO and LSMO in SBL heterostructure is due to the fact that the growth of BFO is accompanied by the formation of defects and dislocations leading to the formation of a rough BFO surface on which the LSMO is then grown. This might be related to the fact that LSMO and STO are true perovskite structures, while BFO has a rhombohedral crystal symmetry which is only approximated by a perovskite structure. So different crystallographic variants will coexist on a cubic single crystalline substrate surface, while LSMO can grow truly epitaxially on STO. Such tendency of reduced $M_S$ was also observed in a series of SBL heterostructures having different thicknesses of BFO. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:SQUID}b, the FWHM of the rocking curve of the (002) reflection of both BFO and LSMO layers increases with the thickness of BFO, while the $M_S$ decreases. Therefore, these results signify that the reduction of $M_S$ is a function of effective fraction of volume owing the magnetic long-range order.\n\nTo examine the possible correlation between the exchange bias interaction and the atomic structure at the interface, HAADF-STEM was conducted on both SBL and SLB heterostructures shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:TEM}\\,\\cite{S1}. For the SLB, both LSMO/BFO and LSMO/STO interfaces are sharp with no dislocations or other defects (Fig.~\\ref{Fig:TEM}a).

Unlike the SLB, the SBL heterostructure shows a rough BFO/LSMO interface (Fig.~\\ref{Fig:TEM}c), yet a rather sharp STO/BFO interface (Fig.~\\ref{Fig:TEM}d). The high-resolution TEM images and FFT patterns (not shown here) of this sample reveal that both BFO and LSMO layers have relatively poor crystalline quality for this stack sequence.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth,clip=true]{Fig3.eps}\n\\caption{HAADF-STEM images of (a) the STO/LSMO/BFO (SLB) and (c) the STO/BFO/LSMO (SBL) heterostructures.

In this model, an intermixed interface which exhibits exchange interaction is energetically favored. Such an interface is associated with uncompensated Fe moments when the BFO at the interface is positively charged.

Magnetometry and magnetoresistance measurements do not show a detectable exchange bias coupling for the multistack with sharp interface. Instead, the heterostructures with rough and chemically intermixed interfaces exhibit a sizable exchange bias coupling.

In this context, BFO as a natural multiferroic (antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric) has become a canonical compound of interest due to the scarcity of room temperature multiferroics in nature\\,\\cite{Ramesh:07}. The realization of electric field controlled magnetic devices has been practiced by combining BFO with the ferromagnetic oxide LSMO at whose interface, the ferromagnetic order of LSMO is coupled with the antiferromagnetic order and ferroelectric orders of BFO through the exchange bias interaction. It has been demonstrated that any stack sequence of LSMO on BFO\\,\\cite{Wu:13} or BFO on LSMO\\,\\cite{Yu:10, Yu:12, Xu:14} can exhibit an exchange bias interaction at temperatures below 100\\,K as the blocking temperature\\,\\cite{Yu:10}. The exchange bias is attributed to the uncompensated Fe moments at the interface based on the observation of ferromagnetic Fe atoms registered by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism signals\\,\\cite{Yu:10}. However, recent polarized neutron reflectivity (PNR) and X-ray resonant magnetic reflectometry measurements revealed no ferromagnetic Fe at the interface due to the formation of a magnetically diluted interface\\,\\cite{Bertinshaw:14}. In contrast, another report of PNR measurement on (LSMO)$_6$-(BFO)$_5$ superlattices shows ferromagnetic Fe within the BFO layers\\,\\cite{Singh:14}. Moreover, some theoretical models have been suggested to describe the exchange bias coupling at the interface of LSMO and BFO. A microscopic model considering magnetic exchange interaction and ferroelectric Coulomb interaction confirms the induced magnetization in BFO upon charge transfer\\,\\cite{calderon:11}. On the other hand, density functional calculations predict the formation of uncompensated Fe moments not at an abrupt interface of BFO and LSMO, but rather at an intermixed and rough one\\,\\cite{Neumann:12}. \n\nIn this paper, we study two different stack sequences, namely STO/BFO/LSMO (SBL) and STO/LSMO/BFO (SLB) in which the STO stands for SrTiO$_3$ substrate. We demonstrate the role of interface roughness on the exchange bias at the interface. Our findings show no exchange bias at the sharp interfaces, but a sizable one at rough and chemically intermixed interfaces. Furthermore, we use the temperature dependence of coercivity and exchange bias field to analyze the spin coupling at the interface of BFO and LSMO. \n\t\nMultistack heterostructures of SBL and SLB were grown on STO (001) single crystalline substrate using pulsed laser deposition. Magnetoresistance (MR) measurements were performed on Hall-bar like microstructures which were fabricated using electron beam lithography and Ar$^+$ ion milling (for details on sample fabrication, see the supplementary information\\,\\cite{S1}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth,clip=true]{Fig1.eps}\n\\caption{MR curves measured at 10\\,K after poling the BFO with a $\\pm3$\\,V pulsed gate voltage for (a) STO/SRO/BFO/LSMO and (b) STO/LSMO/BFO/SRO heterostructures in which the SRO (SrRuO$_3$) was used as an electrode.

The temperature dependence of coercivity and the field-dependence of $T_{irr}$ suggest a spin-glass-like state at the interface of BFO and LSMO independent of the stack sequence and therefore the roughness of the interface. We speculate that the observation of a spin-glass-like behavior is indicative to result from the complex spin structure of the BFO. In fact, other studies suggest a spin-glass behavior for amorphous\\,\\cite{Nakamura:93} and (111)-oriented single crystalline thin films\\,\\cite{Singh:09} of BFO. Due to the lack of any sizable net magnetization for our single BFO films, we could not investigate such a scenario using magnetometry measurements. Furthermore, the SLB heterostructure $i.e.$ the heterostructure with the sharp interface exhibits a higher $T_F$ in comparison to the SBL heterostructure $i.e.$ the heterostructure with the relatively rough interface, indicating a more persistent spin-glass-state for the sharp interfaces. This along with the fact that we observe the possible spin-glass-like behavior for both heterostructures suggest that the formation of a spin-glass-like state seems to be independent from the roughness of the interfaces. Obviously, the occurrence of a spin-glass-like state is not directly linked to the observation of exchange bias at the rough interface of SBL heterostructure, and rather reveals the complexity of the spin structure at the interface.\n\n\nIn conclusion, we have investigated the exchange bias interaction at sharp and rough interfaces of LSMO and BFO using MR and SQUID measurements. While the rough interface reveals an exchange bias effect, the sharp interface does not show any sizable exchange bias. Nevertheless, both stack sequences exhibit higher coercive fields compared to a single LSMO layer which is an indication of existence of uncompensated Fe moments at the interface that are either pinned to ferromagnetic LSMO or antiferromagnetic BFO. Moreover, both sequence stacks show a spin-glass-like behavior as the temperature-dependent coercivity and the field-dependent irreversible magnetization temperature curves suggest. While the spin-glass-like behavior seems to be independent of the interface roughness, it reveals the complex spin structure which may be associated with the interface of LSMO and BFO. Our results show that one needs to carefully determine not only the coupling but also the structure before such system is considered to be used as a future electric field controlled device. Our results can be explained well by density functional calculation reported in Ref.\\,\\cite{Neumann:12} predicting an exchange bias effect at rough interfaces. Based on these DFT calculation, in abrupt interfaces (SLB heterostructures), no exchange coupling occurs since the Fe-Mn exchange energy has to be 8 times more than the one of Fe-Fe. Furthermore, the Fe-Mn exchange coupling has to be antiferromagnetic in this case. In a rough and atomically intermixed interface (SBL heterostructures), however, only the antiferromagnetic Fe-Mn exchange coupling has to occur. Therefore, the suggested orbital reconstruction model at the interface of LSMO and BFO\\,\\cite{Wu:13, Yu:10, calderon:11} cannot explain our results, while it has been used to describe the exchange bias effect in similar stacks. This could be due to the complex magnetic structure of BFO since previous studies suggest a cycloidal model of spin ordering along $<110>$ direction\\,\\cite{Lebeugle:08}, a spin-glass-like state\\,\\cite{Singh:09}, and even weak ferromagnetism at low temperatures\\,\\cite{Han:13}. Therefore, the samples across different studies fabricated by different groups need to be compared carefully and have to be individually characterized. Since there is no univocal theoretical picture and given our surprising findings, our result show that structural characterization is the key for understanding the measured electrical properties. In addition, for applications, the fatigue poses another challenge that needs to be addressed and studied in these systems\\,\\cite{S1}.  \n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the EU projects (IFOX, NMP3-LA-2010 246102 and Inspin, FP7-ICT-2013-X 612759) and the Graduate School of Excellence MAINZ (GSC 266 MAINZ) as the funding agents.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\small\n\n\\bibitem{Ramesh:07}\nR.~Ramesh, and N.~A.~Spaldin, Nature~Mater.~{\\bf6}, 21 (2007). \n\n\\bibitem{Wu:13}\nS.~M.~Wu, S.~A.~Cybart, D.~Yi, J.~M.~Parker, R.~Ramesh, and R.~C.~Dynes, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf 110}, 067202 (2013).\n\n\\bibitem{Yu:10}\nP.~Yu, J.-S.~Lee, S.~Okamoto, M.~D.~Rossell, M.~Huijben, C.-H.~Yang, Q.~He, J.~X.~Zhang, S.~Y.~Yang, M.~J.~Lee, Q.~M.~Ramasse, R.~Erni, Y.-H.~Chu, D.~A.~Arena, C.-C.~Kao, L.~W.~Martin, and R.~Ramesh, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf105}, 027201 (2010).\n\n\\bibitem{Yu:12}\nP.~Yu, Y.~H.~Chu, and R.~Ramesh, Phil.~Trans.~R.~Soc.~A~{\\bf370}, 4856 (2012).\n\n\\bibitem{Xu:14}\nQ.~Xu, Y.~Sheng, X.~Xue, X.~Yuan, Z.~Wen, and J.~Du, Jpn.~J.~Appl.~Phys.~{\\bf53}, 08NM01 (2014).\n\n\\bibitem{Bertinshaw:14}\nJ.~Bertinshaw, S.~Br\\\"{u}ck, D.~Lott, H.~Fritzsche, Y.~Khaydukov, O.~Soltwedel, T.~Keller, E.~Goering, P.~Audehm, D.~L.~Cortie, W.~D.~Hutchison, Q.~M.~Ramasse, M.~Arredondo, R.~Maran, V.~Nagarajan, F.~Klose, and C.~Ulrich, Phys.~Rev.~B~{\\bf90}, 041113(R) (2014).\n\n\\bibitem{Singh:14}\nS.~Singh, J.~T.~Haraldsen, J.~Xiong, E.~M.~Choi, P.~Lu, D.~Yi, X.-D.~Wen, J.~Liu, H.~Wang, Z.~Bi, P.~Yu, M.~R.~Fitzsimmons, J.~L.~MacManus-Driscoll, R.~Ramesh, A.~V.~Balatsky, J.-X.~Zhu, and Q.~X.~Jia, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf113}, 047204 (2014). \n\n\\bibitem{calderon:11}\nM.~J.~Calder\\'{o}n, S.~Liang, R.~Yu, J.~Salafranca, S.~Dong, S.~Yunoki, L.~Brey, A.~Moreo, and E.~Dagotto, Phys.~Rev.~B~{\\bf84}, 024422 (2011).\n\n\\bibitem{Neumann:12}\nR.~F.~Neumann, M.~Bahiana, and N.~Binggeli, EPL~{\\bf100}, 67002 (2012).\n\n\\bibitem{S1}\nSee supplementary material at [] for details on deposition conditions, fabrication, MR measurements and further structural and magnetic characterization.\n\n\\bibitem{Radu:08}\nF.~Radu, and H.~Zabel, Springer~Tr.~Mod.~Phys.~{\\bf227}, 97 (2008).\n\n\\bibitem{Bruck:08}\nS.~Br\\\"uck, G.~Sch\\\"utz, E.~Goering, X.~Ji, and K.~M.~Krishnan, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\\bf101}, 126402 (2008).\n\n\\bibitem{Cullity:72}\nB.~D.~Cullity, $Introduction~to~Magnetic~Materials$ (Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1972).\n\n\\bibitem{Moutis:01}\nN.~Moutis, C.~Christides, I.~Panagiotopoulos, and D.~Niarchos, Phys.~Rev.~B~{\\bf64}, 094429 (2001).\n\n\\bibitem{Karmakar:08}\nS.~Karmakar, S.~Taran, E.~Bose, B.~K.~Chaudhuri, C.~P.~Sun, C.~L.~Huang, and H.~D.~Yang, Phys.~Rev.~B~{\\bf77}, 144409 (2008).\n\n\\bibitem{Ding:13}\nJ.~F.~Ding, O.~I.~Lebedev, S.~Turner, Y.~F.~Tian, W.~J.~Hu, J.
