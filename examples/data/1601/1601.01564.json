A new charge ordering is always introduced by different types of instabilities, such as\nlattice distortion or FS nesting. However, the driving force behind the CDW phase is still under debate.\\cite{Gruner1988,Gruner1994,\nMazin2006,Mazin2008,Weber2011,Yao2006,Mansart2012,Inosov2008,Rossnagel2011,Dai2014,Arguello2015,Laverock2005} From a Peierls perspective,\nin an ideal one-dimensional (1D) system, the electronic susceptibility would develop a logarithmic divergence singularity at some sheets\nof the FSs spanning by the nesting vector via EPC, and hence results in a phase transition to the CDW ground state accompanied by the\ncommensurate/incommensurate periodic lattice distortions and the opening of energy gaps at {{$E_F$}}.\\cite{Gruner1988,Gruner1994} Although,\nthe quasi two-dimensional (2D) materials have a weaker tendency towards the nesting-driven CDWs owing to the imperfect nesting caused\nby the increased FS curvature, the electronic susceptibility could still be enhanced sufficiently for a CDW to develop under favorable\nnesting conditions and EPCs.\\cite{Gweon1998,Brouet2004,Brouet2008,Moore2010} Therefore, the CDW states in quasi 2D systems are particularly\nattractive due to the existence of possible multiple nesting properties and interacting collective orders added by the extra dimensionality.\n\nThe fairly simple electronic structure of {{$R$Te$_{3}$}}, where the CDW instabilities usually develop in the planar square nets of\ntellurium,\\cite{Laverock2005} provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate the CDW formation and its\nrelationship with FS nesting under pretty accurate theoretical models. An incommensurate CDW modulation characterized by a\nwave vector $\\bm{q}_1 \\approx$ 2/7$\\bm{c}^*$ was commonly observed.\\cite{DiMasi1995,Christos2006,Ru2006,Ru2008} Recently, a\nsecond CDW transition occurs at lower temperatures with $\\bm{q}_2 \\approx$ 1/3$\\bm{a}^*$ perpendicular to the first was discovered\nin heavier members of {{$R$Te$_{3}$}}.\\cite{Ru2008,Moore2010,Hu2011} Additionally, by the Pd intercalation, the suppression of CDWs and even\nthe emergence of SC were observed.\\cite{He2013} Thus, this system offers the valuable possibility to explore the interplay between\nmultiple CDW instabilities, and also between the CDW and SC orders. However, to date, little is known about the relationship of these\norders belong to different collective phases. In order to obtain a much more comprehensive insight into the multiple CDWs formation\nand the interplay between various correlated electronic states, we performed high-resolution ARPES experiments on series of {{Pd$_x$HoTe$_{3}$}}\nsingle crystals with the help of electrical transport measurements, focusing on the evolution of electronic structures and EPCs upon\nPd intercalation. We provide the first systematic electronic structure study on the interplay between multiple CDWs, and their\nrelationship with SC in {{$R$Te$_{3}$}} family as a function of chemical intercalation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\columnwidth]{fig1}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\vspace{-1.3em}\n  \\caption{(Color online)\n  (a)-(d) Normalized temperature-dependent resistivity data measured on $x$ = 0, {{0.01}}, {{0.02}}, and {{0.04}}, respectively.\n  Insets of (c),(d) are zoom in of $x$ = {{0.02}} and {{0.04}} at low temperatures, respectively, showing the superconducting transitions.\n  }\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n{{Pd$_x$HoTe$_{3}$}} single crystals with various nominal doping levels ($x$ = 0, {{0.01}}, {{0.02}}, and {{0.04}}) are used in our study. In this paper,\ntwo incommensurate CDWs are identified. We observe the coexistence of two CDW gaps created by perpendicular nesting vectors in {{HoTe$_{3}$}} at\nlow temperature. The momentum dependence of the gaps along the inner FS reveals orthorhombicity. A slight Pd intercalation ($x$ = {{0.01}})\nleads to remarkably different trends of these gaps, the gap symmetry turns out to be near tetragonality, proving the competition between\nthe CDW orders. Both CDWs are further suppressed in $x$ = {{0.02}}, leading to the appearance of SC, and they vanish in $x$ = {{0.04}}, where\nthe SC order reaches the maximum, showing the competition between CDW and SC. By quantitatively inspecting the evolution of electronic\nstructures and EPCs, we demonstrate the nesting nature of multiple CDWs, suggest the significant increment of the second CDW gap from\n$x$ = 0 to {{0.01}} determined by the EPC strength. The competition between these two CDWs, and their relationship with SC is very likely\nto be a FS competition scenario.\n\nHigh-quality single crystals of {{Pd$_x$HoTe$_{3}$}} were synthesized by the flux method.\\cite{Pfuner2010} ARPES measurements were performed\nat Renmin University of China and Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, with a He-discharge lamp, at the 1-cubed\nARPES end station at BESSY and PGM beam line of the Synchrotron Radiation Center (Stoughton, WI).

The second\nCDW transition at $\\sim$100 K is barely visible in the resistivity, this was interpreted as a renormalization of the electron\ndispersion in the ungapped FS parts, which may partially compensate the opening of the CDW gap on some FS sheets.\\cite{Sinchenko2014}\nWith the increasing amounts of Pd ($x$ = {{0.01}}), these two CDWs exhibit opposite trends, two bumps merge at $\\sim$220 K.

Both cuts \\#a and \\#b show a\nback-bending band feature, this is reminiscent of the dispersion of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, suggesting the opening of\na CDW gap. Instead, cuts \\#c and \\#d reveal both two quasiparticle branches, demonstrating the center of the CDW gap is\npushed below {{$E_F$}} due to the longer than perfect nesting vector observed,\\cite{Gruner1994,Moore2010} more details are\ndiscussed quantitatively below. This apparent distinction indicates a second CDW gap different from that in cuts \\#a and\n\\#b. Detailed inspection on the binding energies of the branches at $k_F$ reveals the lowering trend from \\#a ($\\sim$0.275\neV) to \\#b ($\\sim$0.255 eV), and the same trend holds from \\#c ($\\sim$0.261 eV) to \\#d ($\\sim$0.243 eV), manifesting the\nshortened nesting vectors.

Figs.~\\ref{fig3}(a)-\\ref{fig3}(c) show the FS mapping data of $x$ = {{0.01}}, {{0.02}},\nand {{0.04}}, respectively. One can see the nearly fourfold symmetric intensity variation in the FSs of $x$ = {{0.01}} and {{0.02}}\nrather than the apparent twofold symmetry in {{HoTe$_{3}$}}, manifesting the symmetry of gap-opening connected to a CDW picture.\\cite{\nBrouet2004,ResidualFS} The shadow bands sketched by red dashes in Figs.~\\ref{fig3}(d) and \\ref{fig3}(e), indicated via cuts \\#a\nand \\#b in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}(a), respectively, also confirm the validity of FS nesting in determining the CDW instabilities in\nthis system.\n\nThe detailed gap anisotropy study of $x$ = {{0.01}} and {{0.02}}, like that of {{HoTe$_{3}$}} in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(b), are displayed in\nFigs.~\\ref{fig3}(f) and \\ref{fig3}(g), respectively, revealing slightly orthorhombic, or nearly tetragonal symmetry, in stark\ncontrast to the orthorhombicity in {{HoTe$_{3}$}}. In the nesting-driven CDW picture, the origin of the intensity variation along the\nFS can be reasonably interpreted by the momentum dependence of these CDW gaps. We summarize the gap size along the inner FS\nof $x$ = 0, {{0.01}}, and {{0.02}} as a function of the FS angle ($\\theta$) in Figs.~\\ref{fig4}(a)-\\ref{fig4}(c), respectively,\nclearly confirming the anisotropy. It is noted that, as indicated by blue filled pentacles in Fig.~\\ref{fig4}(a), the definition\nof the second CDW gap in {{HoTe$_{3}$}} is different from others' ascribed to the observation of both upper and lower quasiparticle branches.\nInstead of the gap between the lower branch and {{$E_F$}} for others, we use the one between these two branches for this exception,\ncharacterized by 2$V$, where $V$ is the coupling parameter between two states connected by nesting vectors including EPCs.\\cite{\nGruner1988,Mazin2008,Brouet2008,Yao2006,Voit2000}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.83\\columnwidth]{fig5}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\vspace{-1.35em}\n  \\caption{(Color online)\n  (a) FS for $x$ = {{0.01}} around the second 3D (reduced) BZ center obtained by integrating the spectra within $\\pm$15 meV\n      with respect to {{$E_F$}}.

By comparing the\nnesting vectors determined by ARPES and TB model calculations with the x-ray diffraction results,\\cite{Ru2008} we can reasonably\ninterpret the momentum dependence of the multiple CDW gaps and the gap center of the second CDW in {{HoTe$_{3}$}} underlying {{$E_F$}}. For {{HoTe$_{3}$}},\nthe two nesting vectors reveal $\\bm{q}_{n1}$ = $\\bm{c}^* - \\bm{q}_{\\mathrm{CDW1}} \\approx$ 0.71(3)$\\bm{c}^*$ and $\\bm{q}_{n2}$ =\n$\\bm{a}^* - \\bm{q}_{\\mathrm{CDW2}} \\approx$ 0.69(5)$\\bm{a}^*$, where the former is in complete agreement with the perfect nesting\nvector along $c$ axis and the latter is longer than that along $a$ axis, respectively. Thus, the center of the second CDW gap is\npushed below {{$E_F$}} even at the corner (\\#2) of the inner FS, and gradually moves to lower binding energy with the shortened nesting vector.\\cite{Ru2008,Gruner1994,Brouet2008} For $x$ = 0.01 and 0.02, the ones parallel to $c$ axis are 0.68(8) and 0.67(1)$\\bm{c}^*$,\nand to $a$ axis are 0.68(4) and 0.67(3)$\\bm{a}^*$, respectively, elucidating the FS topology becomes more isotropic upon Pd intercalation.\n\nThe evolution of the maximal gap size of the two CDW orders upon Pd intercalation are summarized in Fig.~\\ref{fig4}(e).\nCombining the multiple nesting properties discussed above, it is conspicuous that upon Pd intercalation, the interplay\nbetween these two collective phases yields competition, similar to the optical spectroscopy results upon chemical\npressure,\\cite{Hu2014} and to the transport measurements under pressure.\\cite{Hamlin2009,Zocco2015} These can to some\nextent be explicated by our multiple nesting properties, but not adequate yet. Along with the increasing Pd content,\nthe first CDW gap gradually decreases ascribed to the shortened nesting vector. Simultaneously, the second CDW gap\nsubstantially increases for $x$ = {{0.01}}, and then decreases monotonically. The appreciable transform of the second\nCDW gap magnitude from $x$ = 0 to {{0.01}} strongly suggests that, upon Pd intercalation, not only the FS evolution\npointing to the nesting picture, but also the variation of EPC strength is needed to be fully included for investigating\nthe interplay between multiple CDW orders quantitatively.\n\nAccording to the above discussions, one can obtain the coupling strength ($V$) between the states linked by $\\bm{a}^* -\n\\bm{q}_{\\mathrm{CDW2}}$ in {{HoTe$_{3}$}} from Fig.~\\ref{fig2}(b), where 2$V$ = 0.142 eV. However, as only the lower quasiparticle\nbranch being observed in $x$ = {{0.01}}, one cannot determine the EPC unambiguously. Thus, we perform the measurements extended\nto the second three-dimensional (3D) BZ on $x$ = {{0.01}}, and illustrate the FS in Fig.~\\ref{fig5}(a). The dispersion presented\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig5}(b), indicated via cut \\#a in Fig.~\\ref{fig5}(a), is measured at the crossing between $p_x$ and shadow $p_z$\nbands, of which the intensity is too weak to be clearly visible in the plot. It is distinct that a gap completely opens below\n{{$E_F$}}. Since these two states are coupled by a nesting vector, guided by orange arrow, the interaction between them would also\nyields the $V$.\\cite{Brouet2008} We now can precisely measure 2$V$ using the corresponding EDC plot in Fig.~\\ref{fig5}(c),\nshowing 2$V$ = 0.484 eV. Based on this, it is further confirmed that the EPC strength undergoes a significant variation from\n$x$ = 0 to {{0.01}}.\n\nThe detailed studies on the evolution of electronic structures and EPCs give us a high chance to extract the nature of the\ninterplay between multiple CDWs, as well as their relationship with the SC in {{Pd$_x$HoTe$_{3}$}}. According to the temperature versus\npressure phase diagram proposed in Refs. 30 and 31, the role of Pd intercalation on the evolution of two CDWs and SC is\nsimilar to that of pressure performed on {{$R$Te$_{3}$}} compounds. As already pointed out, the first CDW is suppressed monotonically\nbecause of the imperfect nesting. Simultaneously, the EPC strength of the second CDW has a remarkable transform from $x$ =\n0 to {{0.01}}. This may be driven by the possible lattice distortion towards the tetragonal structure upon Pd intercalation,\nresulting from the competition between CDW orders for the low-energy spectral weight available for nesting.\\cite{Hu2014}\nNevertheless, due to the longer than perfect nesting vector along $a$ axis, the center of the second CDW gap still slightly\nlocates below {{$E_F$}} in $x$ = {{0.01}}. Thus, the gap further decreases even with an ideal nesting vector in $x$ = {{0.02}}. The\ncompetition and suppression of these two CDW instabilities give rise to the emergence of SC in $x$ = {{0.02}}, then the SC order\nreaches the maximum with the vanished CDWs in $x$ = {{0.04}}. Extensive work has been carried on the interplay between CDW and SC,\nprincipally in cuprate high-temperature superconductors,\\cite{Ghiringhelli2012,Neto2014} yet the underlying mechanism for the\ncompetition is still controversial. Our ARPES results for the relationship between these collective states may shed light on\nit, even the high-temperature SC. As shown in the phase diagram of polycrystalline {{Pd$_x$HoTe$_{3}$}} in Ref. 24, the weak Pd-intercalation\ndependence of $T_c$ indicates the SC possibly not determined by quantum critical fluctuations, the competition for FS with CDWs\nbased on the Bilbro-McMillan partial gaping scenario may be the dominant nature instead.\\cite{Hamlin2009,Bilbro1976}\n\nTo conclude, we have performed ARPES and electrical transport experiments on {{Pd$_x$HoTe$_{3}$}} single crystals to study the interplay\nbetween multiple CDWs and their relationship with SC. We report the systematic evolution of the electronic structures and\nEPCs upon Pd intercalation, determine the nesting-driven nature of the CDWs formation, and find the competition between\nthese CDW orders is for the low-energy spectral weight. The compelling evidences for the dramatic transform of EPC strength\nalong $a$ axis from $x$ = 0 to {{0.01}} leave the effect of Pd intercalation further complicated, requiring future studies to\nclarify. The competition between SC and CDWs for the FS may provide insight into the microscopic origin of high-temperature\nSC, paves the way to identifying more high-temperature superconductors.\n\nWe would like to thank Anmin Zhang, Yong Tian, and Qingming Zhang for helpful discussions, and Hechang Lei for the help in\nplotting figures.
