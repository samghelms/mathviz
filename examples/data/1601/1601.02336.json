Specifically, the excitation of magnetization precession has led to current controlled oscillators that operate at \nGHz frequencies~\\cite{Silva2008} and spin-current driven magnetization reversal has led to the development of non-volatile magnetic memory \ndevices~\\cite{KentWorledge2015}. Spin currents create spin-transfer torques (STT) that provide a means of exciting and driving non-linear magnetization dynamics\nof nanometer scale magnets (or nanomagnets). The magnetization dynamics is also strongly affected by the presence of thermal noise which can alter the stability of \nmagnetization states and the nature of the spin-transfer induced dynamics, including precessional magnetization orbits. \n\nTypically the magnetization dynamics consist of a fast gyromagnetic precession, whose amplitude\nslowly changes over time due to spin torque and thermal effects. This separation of timescales can be used to study analytically the dynamical and thermal stability of nanomagnets subject to spin-polarized currents~\\cite{Newhall2013,Pinna2013,Pinna2014}, and allows \nfor a reduction in complexity of the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (sLLGS) equations to a simpler\none-dimensional stochastic differential equation. In the absence of damping, spin torque, and thermal noise, the dynamics conserve the macrospin energy, but in their presence a macrospin's dynamical evolution deviates from a constant energy trajectory.  \n\nThus an analysis of the noise-induced dynamics obtained by averaging the magnetization equations over constant-energy orbits provides significant new insights. Some of the authors of this paper have done this for a biaxial nanomagnet with an easy axis in the film plane and a hard axis out of the plane, typical of thin film nanomagnets patterned into asymmetric shapes (e.g. an ellipse)~\\cite{Pinna2013,Pinna2014}.  Relevant dynamical scenarios have been shown to depend on the ratio between hard and easy axis anisotropies. The range of currents for which limit cycles exist was found, and the constant energy orbit averaging approach was used to study the magnetization dynamics of spin-torque oscillators, both in the\npresence of thermal noise and as a function of the spin-polarization angle in a biaxial macrospin model~\\cite{Pinna2013}. For this case analytical expressions were derived for currents that generate and sustain the out-of-plane precessional states. Further, there is a critical angle of the spin polarization necessary for the occurrence of such states. We also predicted a hysteretic response to applied current~\\cite{Pinna2014}, which were tested in experiments on orthogonal spin-transfer devices~ \\cite{Kent2004}, where the predicted hysteretic transitions into an intermediate resistance state were observed~\\cite{Ye2015}.\n\nHere we consider STT magnetization switching that occurs by out-of-plane precessional magnetization dynamics, as can occur in an orthogonal spin-transfer device. For this case it was widely thought that thermal and other noise sources would lead to dephasing of the precessional motion and thus an indeterminate magnetic state after the pulse ends. Here we demonstrate and explain a rather unexpected result that when the decay of a spin-current pulse is sufficiently slow the switching is very reliable even in the presence of noise, with the current pulse polarity determining the final magnetization state. After introducing our model for a biaxial nanomagnet and its dynamical modes we consider the effect of the pulse decay on the magnetization's final state. We determine the switching probability by numerically integrating the sLLGS equations and then describe our analytic model which explains the origin of the highly reliable switching. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Macrospin Model with Spin-Transfer Torques}\n\nWe study a macrospin with magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ of constant modulus ($M_s=|\\mathbf{M}|$) with a biaxial magnetic anisotropy, with easy direction along the $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$-axis and hard direction along $\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$. Its energy landscape depends on the projection of the magnetization onto these two axes\\footnote{The projection along a third orthogonal axis is a dependent quantity arising from our choice of a fixed modulus magnetization.}.

We note that this is generally a non-conservative torque and thus its effects cannot be described in terms of the gradient of an effective energy. This renders many techniques used to analyze the energetics involved in the macrospin's evolution inapplicable. However, previous work has shown that whenever the timescales for thermal and spin-torque driven diffusion are much larger than the conservative precessional timescale, non-conservative effects can be studied perturbatively~\\cite{Apalkov,Newhall2013,Pinna2013}. Effectively, the macrospin precesses multiple times along nearly constant energy trajectories, only diffusing slowly in energy. This allows for an averaging of the LLGS dynamics (\\ref{eq:Langevindynamics}) along constant energy trajectories (shown in Fig.~\\ref{F1}(b)) to obtain a description of the macrospin's dynamics solely in terms of diffusive behavior over its conservative energy landscape~\\cite{Pinna2013}. An analysis of the time evolution of the macrospin's energy provides significant insights into magnetization dynamics in the presence of STT.\n\nWe summarize the main results of such an analysis, the details of which can be found in Refs.~\\cite{Pinna2013,Pinna2014}. There are two \nfundamental features of a biaxial macrospin subject to a spin current. The first is that there are two critical currents ($I_c$ and $I_\\mathrm{OOP}$). For currents $I>I_c=(2/\\pi)\\sqrt{D(D+1)}/\\cos\\omega$ the entire AP basin becomes unstable ($\\dot{\\epsilon}>0$ for all $\\epsilon<0$) and magnetic states within it will be driven into the $m_z>0$ OOP basin ($\\mathrm{OOP}^+$). In turn, the magnetization will either then proceed to relax to the stable P basin or, if $I>I_\\mathrm{OOP}=I_c/(\\sqrt{D}\\tan\\omega)$, remain in the $\\mathrm{OOP}^+$ basin evolving along a constant energy orbit, thus maintaining a steady-state OOP precession. \n\nThe second fundamental feature is there is a critical tilt of the spin-polarization axis that determines the nature of the magnetization dynamics excited by the spin-transfer torque. At the critical tilt $\\omega_c={\\mathrm{atan}}(1/\\sqrt{D})$, $I_c=I_\\mathrm{OOP}$ and for $\\omega>\\omega_c$, $I_c>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$. For subcritical tilts $\\omega<\\omega_c$ the current can be increased such that $I_c<I<I_\\mathrm{OOP}$. If the current is increased sufficiently slowly (so that the constant energy orbit approach applies), magnetizations in the AP state will evolve toward OOP states but immediately relax into the P basin, leading to a deterministic switch~\\footnote{$I_c$ is denoted the critical switching current for this reason.}. Conversely, for supercritical tilts, all magnetic states excited into OOP states will remain there until the current is lowered back below $I_\\mathrm{OOP}$. \n\nThese magnetization switching characteristics can be seen by numerically integrating the sLLGS equation, Eq.~\\ref{eq:Langevindynamics}. We have done this for an ensembles of 92160 independent macrospins, sampling the entire Bloch sphere homogeneously, with an integration time step of $0.01$ in natural time units, i.e. $\\tau$. Results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{F3}(c) \\& (d), where we take a damping constant $\\alpha=0.04$ and $D=10$.\n\nFig.~\\ref{F3} shows the final magnetization state after a current pulse greater than the $I_c$ ($I=1.5I_c$) for subcritical tilts ($\\omega=0.5\\omega_c$ Fig.~\\ref{F3}(c)) and supercritical tilts ($\\omega=2.5\\omega_c$ Fig.~\\ref{F3}(d)). In both cases the thermal noise $\\xi=80$ is present and the driving current is instantaneously switched off at the end the $1$ ns$\\cdot$T pulse (physical times are obtained upon dividing by $\\mu_0H_K$). For subcritcial tilts a large fraction of initial magnetization states have switched into the P basin. The not-switched states are around the AP state $m_x=1$ and the north and south poles of the Bloch sphere. Those near the AP state did not have time to switch during the finite duration of the current pulse; had the pulse been left on for a longer time there would been fewer not-switched states in this zone. In the supercritical case the large tilt allows the current to excite all IP states into OOP orbits where thermal noise and dynamical decoherence shuffle the trajectories enough that, once relaxation takes place in the absence of a current, the final states appears random.\n\n\n\nHaving seen the characteristic switching dynamics in the presence of noise for sub- and supercritical tilts, we now investigate a case in which the driving current is switched off gradually as opposed in the stepwise fashion we have considered up to this point. We again consider a pulse that is turned on for a time $0.27 \\,(n\\mathrm{s}\\cdot T)$ but decays exponentially, $I(t)=I_0\\exp\\left(-t/\\tau_I\\right)$. The pulse thus decays from a value $I_0>I_c>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$ with a time constant $\\tau_I$. We again sample the entire Bloch sphere and determine to what state the magnetization relaxated in the presence of noise. \n  \n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\\centerline{\\includegraphics [clip,width=5in, angle=0]{Fig4.png}}\n\t\\end{center}\n    \\caption{{\\footnotesize Relaxed configuration of the Bloch sphere as a function of initial magnetization for $D=10$, $\\alpha=0.04$ and $\\omega=2.5\\,\\omega_c$ where colors white/black imply relaxation into P/AP basins respectively.

As the decay rate is made progressively larger, the Bloch sphere is seen to overwhelmingly relax into the P basin. This result is in remarkable contrast to what was seen in Figure~\\ref{F3}(d). The current pulse is sufficient to excite OPP orbits yet if the pulse decay time is sufficiently slow the magnetization relaxes reliably into a state set by the current polarity (positive current in our model favors the P state). The effect is more pronounced at lower temperature (compare Fig.~~\\ref{F4}(c) and (f)).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics[width=3in]{ProbRelax_D10.png}\n    \t\\end{centering}\n\t\\caption{{\\footnotesize Switching probability as a function of pulse decay time for a model with $D=10$, $\\alpha=0.04$ and $\\omega=2.5\\,\\omega_c$.

It is clear that the effect is robust as a function of temperature but the switching probability increases on reducing the temperature. We further find that the switching probability is nearly independent of the pulse amplitude (i.e $I_0$) provided the pulse is of sufficient amplitude and duration to excite the vast majority of IP states into OPP orbits. This dynamics is thus an important and fundamental characteristic of a biaxial macrospin subject to a spin-transfer torque and demands a physical and mathematical explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Orthogonal Drift Biasing at the Separatrix}\n\nTo explain this phenomena we consider a scenario where a fixed current is sustaining a stable OOP precessional state ($I>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$). As discussed in the previous section, the macrospin's steady-state dynamics trace a constant energy orbit, which is a fixed point of the averaged energy dynamics. Changing the current will alter the fixed point and the macrospin will diffuse to a new constant energy trajectory. If changes in the driving current are made slowly enough, then relaxational dynamics will ensure that the energy of the macrospin's precessional orbits evolves adiabatically with the current. In turn, the macrospin's average energy will trace a sequence of fixed points. When $I=I_\\mathrm{OOP}$, the structure of the LLGS drift at the separatrix (averaged over one $\\epsilon=0$ revolution) will then influence which IP basin ($m_x<0$ or $m_x>0$) the magnetization relaxes into.\n\nTo make these statements quantitative, we first parametrize the energy separatrix and project the complete LLGS dynamics~(\\ref{eq:Langevindynamics}) onto both its tangent and normal. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{F1}(b), the energy separatrix is an intersection of two great circles (shown in black and purple).

We note that this is generally a non-conservative torque and thus its effects cannot be described in terms of the gradient of an effective energy. This renders many techniques used to analyze the energetics involved in the macrospin's evolution inapplicable. However, previous work has shown that whenever the timescales for thermal and spin-torque driven diffusion are much larger than the conservative precessional timescale, non-conservative effects can be studied perturbatively~\\cite{Apalkov,Newhall2013,Pinna2013}. Effectively, the macrospin precesses multiple times along nearly constant energy trajectories, only diffusing slowly in energy. This allows for an averaging of the LLGS dynamics (\\ref{eq:Langevindynamics}) along constant energy trajectories (shown in Fig.~\\ref{F1}(b)) to obtain a description of the macrospin's dynamics solely in terms of diffusive behavior over its conservative energy landscape~\\cite{Pinna2013}. An analysis of the time evolution of the macrospin's energy provides significant insights into magnetization dynamics in the presence of STT.\n\nWe summarize the main results of such an analysis, the details of which can be found in Refs.~\\cite{Pinna2013,Pinna2014}. There are two \nfundamental features of a biaxial macrospin subject to a spin current. The first is that there are two critical currents ($I_c$ and $I_\\mathrm{OOP}$). For currents $I>I_c=(2/\\pi)\\sqrt{D(D+1)}/\\cos\\omega$ the entire AP basin becomes unstable ($\\dot{\\epsilon}>0$ for all $\\epsilon<0$) and magnetic states within it will be driven into the $m_z>0$ OOP basin ($\\mathrm{OOP}^+$). In turn, the magnetization will either then proceed to relax to the stable P basin or, if $I>I_\\mathrm{OOP}=I_c/(\\sqrt{D}\\tan\\omega)$, remain in the $\\mathrm{OOP}^+$ basin evolving along a constant energy orbit, thus maintaining a steady-state OOP precession. \n\nThe second fundamental feature is there is a critical tilt of the spin-polarization axis that determines the nature of the magnetization dynamics excited by the spin-transfer torque. At the critical tilt $\\omega_c={\\mathrm{atan}}(1/\\sqrt{D})$, $I_c=I_\\mathrm{OOP}$ and for $\\omega>\\omega_c$, $I_c>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$. For subcritical tilts $\\omega<\\omega_c$ the current can be increased such that $I_c<I<I_\\mathrm{OOP}$. If the current is increased sufficiently slowly (so that the constant energy orbit approach applies), magnetizations in the AP state will evolve toward OOP states but immediately relax into the P basin, leading to a deterministic switch~\\footnote{$I_c$ is denoted the critical switching current for this reason.}. Conversely, for supercritical tilts, all magnetic states excited into OOP states will remain there until the current is lowered back below $I_\\mathrm{OOP}$. \n\nThese magnetization switching characteristics can be seen by numerically integrating the sLLGS equation, Eq.~\\ref{eq:Langevindynamics}. We have done this for an ensembles of 92160 independent macrospins, sampling the entire Bloch sphere homogeneously, with an integration time step of $0.01$ in natural time units, i.e. $\\tau$. Results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{F3}(c) \\& (d), where we take a damping constant $\\alpha=0.04$ and $D=10$.\n\nFig.~\\ref{F3} shows the final magnetization state after a current pulse greater than the $I_c$ ($I=1.5I_c$) for subcritical tilts ($\\omega=0.5\\omega_c$ Fig.~\\ref{F3}(c)) and supercritical tilts ($\\omega=2.5\\omega_c$ Fig.~\\ref{F3}(d)). In both cases the thermal noise $\\xi=80$ is present and the driving current is instantaneously switched off at the end the $1$ ns$\\cdot$T pulse (physical times are obtained upon dividing by $\\mu_0H_K$). For subcritcial tilts a large fraction of initial magnetization states have switched into the P basin. The not-switched states are around the AP state $m_x=1$ and the north and south poles of the Bloch sphere. Those near the AP state did not have time to switch during the finite duration of the current pulse; had the pulse been left on for a longer time there would been fewer not-switched states in this zone. In the supercritical case the large tilt allows the current to excite all IP states into OOP orbits where thermal noise and dynamical decoherence shuffle the trajectories enough that, once relaxation takes place in the absence of a current, the final states appears random.\n\n\n\nHaving seen the characteristic switching dynamics in the presence of noise for sub- and supercritical tilts, we now investigate a case in which the driving current is switched off gradually as opposed in the stepwise fashion we have considered up to this point. We again consider a pulse that is turned on for a time $0.27 \\,(n\\mathrm{s}\\cdot T)$ but decays exponentially, $I(t)=I_0\\exp\\left(-t/\\tau_I\\right)$. The pulse thus decays from a value $I_0>I_c>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$ with a time constant $\\tau_I$. We again sample the entire Bloch sphere and determine to what state the magnetization relaxated in the presence of noise. \n  \n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\\centerline{\\includegraphics [clip,width=5in, angle=0]{Fig4.png}}\n\t\\end{center}\n    \\caption{{\\footnotesize Relaxed configuration of the Bloch sphere as a function of initial magnetization for $D=10$, $\\alpha=0.04$ and $\\omega=2.5\\,\\omega_c$ where colors white/black imply relaxation into P/AP basins respectively.

As the decay rate is made progressively larger, the Bloch sphere is seen to overwhelmingly relax into the P basin. This result is in remarkable contrast to what was seen in Figure~\\ref{F3}(d). The current pulse is sufficient to excite OPP orbits yet if the pulse decay time is sufficiently slow the magnetization relaxes reliably into a state set by the current polarity (positive current in our model favors the P state). The effect is more pronounced at lower temperature (compare Fig.~~\\ref{F4}(c) and (f)).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\begin{centering}\n        \\includegraphics[width=3in]{ProbRelax_D10.png}\n    \t\\end{centering}\n\t\\caption{{\\footnotesize Switching probability as a function of pulse decay time for a model with $D=10$, $\\alpha=0.04$ and $\\omega=2.5\\,\\omega_c$.

It is clear that the effect is robust as a function of temperature but the switching probability increases on reducing the temperature. We further find that the switching probability is nearly independent of the pulse amplitude (i.e $I_0$) provided the pulse is of sufficient amplitude and duration to excite the vast majority of IP states into OPP orbits. This dynamics is thus an important and fundamental characteristic of a biaxial macrospin subject to a spin-transfer torque and demands a physical and mathematical explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Orthogonal Drift Biasing at the Separatrix}\n\nTo explain this phenomena we consider a scenario where a fixed current is sustaining a stable OOP precessional state ($I>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$). As discussed in the previous section, the macrospin's steady-state dynamics trace a constant energy orbit, which is a fixed point of the averaged energy dynamics. Changing the current will alter the fixed point and the macrospin will diffuse to a new constant energy trajectory. If changes in the driving current are made slowly enough, then relaxational dynamics will ensure that the energy of the macrospin's precessional orbits evolves adiabatically with the current. In turn, the macrospin's average energy will trace a sequence of fixed points. When $I=I_\\mathrm{OOP}$, the structure of the LLGS drift at the separatrix (averaged over one $\\epsilon=0$ revolution) will then influence which IP basin ($m_x<0$ or $m_x>0$) the magnetization relaxes into.\n\nTo make these statements quantitative, we first parametrize the energy separatrix and project the complete LLGS dynamics~(\\ref{eq:Langevindynamics}) onto both its tangent and normal. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{F1}(b), the energy separatrix is an intersection of two great circles (shown in black and purple). We denote by $\\bm{\\gamma}^{1,2}(s)$ the circles composing the separatrix, where $s$ is the coordinate on the circle and $1,2$ correspond to the black/purple circle respectively. The tangent to the separatrix will be $\\bm{\\gamma}_{//}^{1,2}(s)=\\partial_s\\bm{\\gamma}^{1,2}$ and its normal is given by $\\bm{\\gamma}_{\\bot}^{1,2}(s)=\\bm{\\gamma}^{1,2}\\times\\bm{\\gamma}_{//}^{1,2}$ (shown as green and red arrows respectively in Figure~\\ref{F1}).

Upon linearizing the energy evolution equations around $\\epsilon_0$ fixed point ($\\epsilon\\to\\epsilon_0+\\delta\\epsilon$) (see Appendix B), the perturbations will be governed by dynamics which exponentially decay with timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rel}}(I)$.\nFigure~\\ref{F6} shows how the relaxation rate  of perturbations to a given steady-state precessionary state is expected to change as a function of currents $I>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$ and varying temperature for a sample with $D=10$, $\\alpha=0.04$ and $\\omega=2.5\\,\\omega_c$. Larger currents and temperature are seen to favor a faster relaxation of the magnetization dynamics.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\begin{centering}\n    \t\\includegraphics[width=3in]{TimeRelax_D10.png}\n        \t\\end{centering}\n\t\\caption{{\\footnotesize Predicted current and temperature dependence (larger $\\xi$ implies lower temperature) of the energy relaxation rate for a model with $D=10$, $\\alpha=0.04$ and $\\omega=2.5\\,\\omega_c$. (Physical time is obtained upon dividing by $\\mu_0 H_K$.) Whereas larger currents and temperatures ($\\xi\\propto 1/k_BT$) are found to favor faster relaxation of the magnetization dynamics to their steady-state equilibrium, larger temperatures lead to lower overall switching probability due to increased thermal noise present when crossing the separatrix, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{F5}.}}\n\t\\label{F6}\n\\end{figure}\nIf temporal variations of the current happen on a timescale $\\tau_I>\\tau_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, the magnetization will quickly respond to any destabilizing effects and continuously trace nearly constant energy orbits (the adiabatic condition). If, on the other hand, $\\tau_I<\\tau_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ the magnetization will be in an out-of-equilibrium state which cannot be characterized with energy averaging techniques. \n\nThis model thus captures the physics of the situation we simulated numerically in Sec. II, a case in which the a current $I>I_\\mathrm{OOP}$ initially sustains a stable OOP precessional orbit (Figs.~\\ref{F4}\\&\\ref{F5}) and is reduced. If the current is decreased slowly enough for the adiabaticity conditions to be satisfied, the magnetization will experience an orthogonal drift biasing effect and nearly deterministically switch into the P or AP basin depending on the current's polarity. Noise perturbs this deterministic dynamics, causing the magnetization to occasionally jump into the unbiased IP basin even under adiabaticity conditions whenever the effective energy barrier separating the IP/OOP basins becomes comparable to the thermal noise strength. This will happen always as the magnetization precesses very close to the separatrix. For a more detailed quantitative exposition of these effects, the precise orbital behavior near the separatrix (and not just the constant energy orbit averaging description) must be taken into account, which is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nAt lower temperature, however, we see our model capturing the relevant time scales of the switching dynamics quite well. In fact, for current decay timescales comparable to the maximum relaxation timescale ($\\tau_I\\sim\\mathrm{max}\\{\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}\\}$) we see that the switching probability plotted in Fig.~\\ref{F5} approaches $1$ (e.g. for $\\xi=5714$, $\\mathrm{max}\\{\\tau_{\\mathrm{relax}}\\}\\simeq 0.35\\,n\\mathrm{s}\\cdot T$ and high switching probability is seen to take place for current decay timescales $\\tau_I\\geq 0.2\\,n\\mathrm{s}\\cdot T$).\n\n\\section{Effect of Initial Current}\nThe model we have described further predicts that the final magnetization state only depends on the rate at which the current is decreased, not the initial value of the current that sustains the OPP orbits. We have confirmed this result by conducting numerical simulations for different initial currents with the same relaxation rate of the current. The results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{F7} for initial currents of $I=1.5,2.5,3.5\\,I_c$ and a relaxation time of $\\tau_I=0.01\\,(n\\mathrm{s}\\cdot T)$. We see that changing the initial current intensity has no effect on the biasing of the relaxation. Thus the orthogonal drift biasing has been shown to depend exclusively on the LLGS dynamics when the current is varied adiabatically.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n    \\centering\n    \\subfloat[]{{\\includegraphics[width=2.7in]{D17_Exp01_5714K_j11.png} }}\n    \\qquad\n    \\subfloat[]{{\\includegraphics[width=2.7in]{D17_Exp01_5714K_j13.png} }}\n    \\qquad\n    \\subfloat[]{{\\includegraphics[width=2.7in]{D17_Exp01_5714K_j15.png} }}\n    \\caption{{\\footnotesize Relaxed configuration of the Bloch sphere as a function of initial magnetization for $D=10$, $\\alpha=0.04$, $\\omega=2.5\\,\\omega_c$ and temperature $\\xi=5714$, where colors white/black imply relaxation into P/AP basins respectively.

These results can be tested on orthogonal spin-transfer torque devices as well as other types of spin-transfer torque oscillators. Our theory makes specific predictions for the switching probability as a function of the pulse decay time and temperature. The model also makes a strong prediction that the switching probability will be independent of the initial current that sustains the out-of-plane precessional orbit. Further for a slowly decaying current pulse the final magnetization state is also insensitive to the pulse shape and area, only depending on the pulse polarity.\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors would like to acknowledge J.-V.
