After the basic track selection described in the next section, more than 1500 $J/\\psi \\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ candidates are used in this study. \n\nIn order to have pure and larger statistics muon sample, the Monte Carlo of the $J/\\psi \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^- $ signal was used in this study.  \nThe sample was generated by a single-particle generator with flat distributions in $J/\\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_T$), $\\phi$ and $\\eta$. These simulated signals were then passed through the full GEANT3 simulation of the STAR detector, and ``embedded'' into real events followed by the standard reconstruction procedure as used for real data.\nFor comparison, the kinematic distributions of the embedded $J/\\psi$ and $\\mu^{\\pm}$ were weighted by the $p_T$ spectrum of $J/\\psi$ in pp collisions at 500 GeV determined via interpolation through a global fit of differential $J/\\psi$ cross section from world-wide measurements~\\cite{jpsi_pt}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Track selection}\nTracks selected for the muon identification study should meet the following requirements: \n$p_T$ is greater than 1 GeV/c; \n\nthe distance of closest approach to the collision vertex should be less than 3 cm to suppress secondary decays; \nnumber of TPC clusters used in reconstruction should be greater than 15 (the maximum possible is 45) to have good momentum resolution; \nnumber of TPC clusters used for the dE/dx measurement is greater than 10 to ensure good dE/dx resolution;\nthe ratio of the number of TPC clusters over the number of possible clusters is not less than 0.52 in order to reject split tracks. \n\nFor muon candidates, tracks are also required to match to the MTD hits that fire the triggers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:dimuon_mass} shows the dimuon mass spectrum with the selection criteria described above on both muons and it is clear to see the $J/\\psi$ signal around 3.1 $GeV/c^2$. However, the light mesons, like $\\omega$, $\\phi$ and $\\eta$ particles, are not obvious due to the huge background. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{mass_spectrum_mtd}\n      \\end{center}\n  \\caption{  The dimuon mass spectrum with basic selection described in Section 3.2 on both muons.
