Later, we will try to solve this boundary value problem using numerical method developed in Ref.\\cite{He:2013rsa}.\n\n\n\\section{Asymptotic AdS Solutions}\nBased on the set up in previous sections, we pay attention to how to solve the whole system in the UV region $z\\sim 0$ in this section. Near the UV region, we can use series expansion to find the solution of unknown function in metric ansatz (\\ref{ansatz}). These expansions will be helpful to the later numerically computation to show the full numerical solutions.\n\n\\subsection{Massless Scalar Cases}\nIn this section, we will try to find the UV expansion of gravity solution with massless scalar with potential like\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV=\\frac{1}{L^2}\\Big(-12+v_3 \\phi ^3+v_4 \\phi ^4+v_6 \\phi ^6\\Big)\n\\end{eqnarray} In this potential, we set the mass of the scalar to be zero and call this case by massless scalar case for convenience in this paper.\n\nFirstly, the UV behavior of the black hole should be asymptotical\nAdS and there is a horizon parameterized\nby $z_h$ in the IR region. We find an algorithm to get the numerical solution\nconsistently. Roughly speaking, we try to  expand in\npower series all unknown functions as positive powers of $z$. The UV solution can be expressed by following form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{sol1phi}\n\\phi(z)&=&p_4 z^4+\\frac{2 p_4 z^6}{3 L^2}+\\frac{z^8 \\left(p_4-f_4 L^4 p_4\\right)}{2 L^4}-\\frac{2 p_4 z^{10} \\left(2 f_4 L^4-1\\right)}{5 L^6}\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{z^{12} \\left(1728 f_4^2 L^8 p_4-5184 f_4 L^4 p_4+81 L^8 p_4^3 v_4+512 L^8 p_4^3+1728 p_4\\right)}{5184 L^8}\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{z^{14}}{997920 L^{10}} \\Big(855360 f_4^2 L^8 p_4-1140480 f_4 L^4 p_4+34749 L^8 p_4^3 v_4\\nonumber\\\\&+&217600 L^8 p_4^3+285120 p_4\\Big)+O(z^{16})\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{sol1Ae}\nA_e(z)&=&\\frac{1}{81} (-8) p_4^2 z^8-\\frac{64 p_4^2 z^{10}}{495 L^2}+\\frac{64 p_4^2 z^{14} \\left(3 f_4 L^4-2\\right)}{945 L^6}+\\frac{16 z^{12} \\left(2 f_4 L^4 p_4^2-3 p_4^2\\right)}{351 L^4}\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{z^{16} \\left(-69984 f_4^2 L^8 p_4^2+279936 f_4 L^4 p_4^2-2187 L^8 p_4^4 v_4-11776 L^8 p_4^4-116640 p_4^2\\right)}{892296 L^8}\\nonumber\\\\&-&\\frac{2 z^{18} \\left(285120 f_4^2 L^8 p_4^2-475200 f_4 L^4 p_4^2+8019 L^8 p_4^4 v_4+43520 L^8 p_4^4+142560 p_4^2\\right)}{2285415 L^{10}}+O(z^{20})\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{sol1f}\nf(z)&=&1-\\frac{z^2}{L^2}+\\frac{32 p_4^2 z^{14} \\left(74 f_4 L^4-33\\right)}{15015 L^6}+f_4 z^4-\\frac{32 p_4^2 z^{10}}{405 L^2}\\nonumber\\\\\n&+&\\frac{8 z^{12} \\left(11 f_4 L^4 p_4^2-9 p_4^2\\right)}{891 L^4}-\\frac{8 z^{16} \\left(15 f_4^2 L^8 p_4^2-42 f_4 L^4 p_4^2+13 p_4^2\\right)}{1755 L^8}\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{z^{18} \\left(-645408 f_4^2 L^8 p_4^2+819072 f_4 L^4 p_4^2-3645 L^8 p_4^4 v_4-48640 L^8 p_4^4-194400 p_4^2\\right)}{3903795 L^{10}}+O(z^{20})\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nOne can find the black hole solution in the UV region can be\nexpressed in series of powers of $z$. In principle, one can obtain\nmore higher powers of $z$ to get the full expression of black hole\nbackground. Unfortunately, we can not obtain closed form of the\nblack hole solution. The main reason is that we do not find simple\nrecurrence relation among the coefficients of each power of $z$, as explained in \\cite{He:2013rsa}. In terms of AdS/CFT dictionary, the massless neutral scalar in the bulk will dual to $\\Delta=4$ operator in field theory side. $p_4$ is the expectation value of dual operator. It\nis easy to see that the black hole solution with asymptotical AdS\ncan be controlled by integral constants $p_4, f_{4}$ in (\\ref{sol1phi})(\\ref{sol1Ae})(\\ref{sol1f}).\n$p_4, f_{4}$ are determined by boundary\ncondition in IR region. Here we choose parameters $p_4, f_{4}$\nto show one black hole solution numerically. Here $ p_4, f_{4}$ are\nnot independent and they are related to the horizon position $z_h$\nsuch that $Q(z_h)=0$. We impose $\\phi(z_h)$ to be regular, which could be guaranteed by requiring $Q(z_h)=0$.\n\n\\subsection{Massive Scalar Cases}\nFirstly, we try to figure out asymptotic AdS solution of our setup with potential like\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV=\\frac{1}{L^2}\\Big(-12-\\frac{16 \\phi ^2}{3}+v_3 \\phi ^3+v_4 \\phi ^4+v_6 \\phi ^6\\Big)\n\\end{eqnarray} In this potential, we have introduced a mass term of scalar field and we will call this case by massive scalar case.\nWith above potential, we can find the solution near the UV region analytically. As shown in massless case, the UV\nbehavior of the black hole should be asymptotical AdS and there is a\nhorizon in the IR region which is parameterized by $z_h$. The asymptotic solution is following\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\phi(z)&=&p_2 z^2+p_{22} z^2 \\log (z)+\\frac{1}{64} z^4 \\left(18 p_2^2 v_3-36 p_{22} p_2 v_3+27 p_{22}^2 v_3+32 p_{22}\\right)+\\frac{9}{32} p_{22}^2 v_3 z^4 \\log ^2(z)\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{9}{16} z^4 \\left(p_2 p_{22} v_3-p_{22}^2 v_3\\right) \\log (z)+O(z^6 \\log(z))\\nonumber\\\\\n&-&\\frac{z^6}{18432000 L^4} \\Big(4608000 f_4 L^4 p_2+2304000 f_4 L^4 p_{22}-729000 L^4 p_2^3 v_3^2\\nonumber\\\\&+&1366875 L^4 p_{22}^3 v_3^2-3371625 L^4 p_2 p_{22}^2 v_3^2+2551500 L^4 p_2^2 p_{22} v_3^2-1728000 L^4 p_2^3 v_4\\nonumber\\\\&+&648000 L^4 p_{22}^3 v_4-1944000 L^4 p_2 p_{22}^2 v_4+2592000 L^4 p_2^2 p_{22} v_4-3276800 L^4 p_2^3\n\\nonumber\\\\&+&595968 L^4 p_{22}^3-2043904 L^4 p_2 p_{22}^2+2129920 L^4 p_2^2 p_{22}-2592000 L^2 p_2^2 v_3\\nonumber\\\\&-&1620000 L^2 p_{22}^2 v_3+2592000 L^2 p_2 p_{22} v_3-4608000 p_{22}\\Big)+O(z^8)\\label{massivescalar}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nA_e(z)&=&\\frac{z^6 \\left(-74088 p_2^3 v_3+142884 p_{22} p_2^2 v_3-96390 p_{22}^2 p_2 v_3-14013 p_{22}^3 v_3-131712 p_{22} p_2-25088 p_{22}^2\\right)}{1555848}\\nonumber\\\\&-&\\frac{1}{21} p_{22}^3 v_3 z^6 \\log ^3(z)+\\frac{1}{98} z^6 \\left(9 p_{22}^3 v_3-14 p_2 p_{22}^2 v_3\\right) \\log ^2(z)\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{z^6 \\left(-2295 p_{22}^3 v_3+6804 p_2 p_{22}^2 v_3-5292 p_2^2 p_{22} v_3-3136 p_{22}^2\\right) \\log (z)}{37044}\\nonumber\\\\&+&\\frac{\\left(-200 p_2^2-20 p_{22} p_2-21 p_{22}^2\\right) z^4}{2250}-\\frac{4}{45} p_{22}^2 z^4 \\log ^2(z)-\\frac{2}{225} \\left(p_{22}^2+20 p_2 p_{22}\\right) z^4 \\log (z)+O(z^6)\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nf(z)&=&1-z^2f_4 z^4-\\frac{2 \\left(900 p_2^2-660 p_{22} p_2+407 p_{22}^2\\right) z^6}{10125}\\nonumber\\\\&-&\\frac{1}{45} 8 p_{22}^2 z^6 \\log ^2(z)-\\frac{8}{675} \\left(30 p_2 p_{22}-11 p_{22}^2\\right) z^6 \\log (z)+O(z^8)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nIt is easy to see that the black hole solution with\nasymptotical AdS can be controlled by three integral constants\n$p_2, p_{22} , f_{4}$.\n$p_2, p_{22} , f_{4}$ are determined by boundary\ncondition in IR region. In this case, $p_2, p_{22} , f_{4}$ are not\nindependent and they are determined by the black hole horizon $z_h$.\nWe still impose $\\phi(z_h)$ to be regular which is horizon boundary condition.\nThe temperature is also defined by $T={{f'(z)\\over 4\\pi}|_{z=z_h}}$.\n\n\\section{New Hyperbolic Black Hole Solutions}\nIn this paper, we focus on the scalar potential with polynomial form of scalar with highest sextic self-interaction. We explore a systematic way to generate fully backreaction gravity solutions and investigate corresponding phase structure. In the following subsections, we will show two examples to demonstrate these configurations of fields.\n\\subsection{Massless Scalar Cases}\nIn this subsection, we numerically solve the gravity setup with generic potential like $V(\\phi)=\\frac{1}{L^2}\\left(-12+v_4 \\phi^4 \\right)$. Here we just set the mass term of scalar to be vanishing. In this case, the dual operator $O_1$ is relate to dimension 4 glueball operator. One can check that the solution satisfies asymptotical AdS UV boundary condition. In Fig.\\ref{massless-1}(a)(b)(c), the UV behavior of these fields has been shown respectively. We just solve these solutions from UV to IR. In the IR, we should impose regular boundary conditions to all these fields. Especially, we have shown $f(z_h)=0$ numerically in Fig.~\\ref{massless-1}(c), where $Q(z)$ has been defined in Sec.\\ref{gravity-setup} to check IR boundary condition. In this example shown in Fig.\\ref{massless-1}(a)(b)(c), we can turn off the potential parameter $v_4$ and reproduce the case studied in \\cite{Belin:2013dva}. For case $v_4=0$, the condensation of dual operator and free energy will be also studied in section \\ref{masslessphasetransition} which is consistent with studies in \\cite{Belin:2013dva}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=4.5 cm \\epsfysize=4.5 cm \\epsfbox{zeromass-1-phi.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=4.5 cm \\epsfysize=4.5\ncm\\epsfbox{zeromass-1-AE.eps}\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=4.5 cm \\epsfysize=4.5\ncm\\epsfbox{zeromass-1-f.eps}  \\vskip -0.05cm \\hskip 0.15 cm\n\\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\hskip 4.5 cm  \\textbf{( c )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Characteristic solutions when $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$ with $\\nu_4=-8$.

Here we set the mass of scalar to be $m^2=-\\frac{16}{3L^2}$ which corresponds to dimension-2 operators in 4D. In terms of AdS dictionary, the dual operator $O_2$ is related to meson operator In this case, one have set $p_{22}=0$ to find solution and the $p_{22}$ corresponds to source of dual operator $O_2$ in terms of AdS/CFT. In Fig.~\\ref{massive-1}(a)(b)(c), we show the expected IR and UV behaviors of all related fields in Einstein equations. Once we obtain these non trivial configurations, we can go further to study their stability and ERE in dual field theories.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=4.5 cm \\epsfysize=4.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-1-phi.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=4.5 cm \\epsfysize=4.5\ncm\\epsfbox{mass-1-AE.eps}\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=4.5 cm \\epsfysize=4.5\ncm\\epsfbox{mass-1-f.eps}  \\vskip -0.05cm \\hskip 0.15 cm\n\\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\hskip 4.5 cm  \\textbf{( c )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Characteristic solutions when $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$ with $\\nu_4=-8$.

Firstly, to obtain well defined energy\nmomentum tensor on the boundary, one should introduce the suitable\ncounter terms. For later use, we will work out a well defined counter term for these gravity solutions and these terms will\nbe also used in studying free energy and spherical Renyi entropy of dual CFTs.\n\n\\subsection{Energy Momentum Tensor}\nIn this subsection, we would like to introduce the counter terms to\ncancel the UV divergences of the action and make the energy momentum\ntensor of dual field theory well defined. We just introduce generic gauge invariant counter terms with undetermined coefficients in our system. Finally, we can solve these coefficients to cancel the divergences in massless and massive cases respectively in this paper.\n\\subsubsection{Massless Scalar Cases}\nFor massless scalar case, the total action now becomes\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{C2}\nI_{\\text{ren}}&=&S_{\\text{5D}}+\nS_{\\text{GH}}+S_{\\text{count}}\\nonumber\\\\&=&\\frac{1}{16 \\pi G_5}\n\\int_M d^5\nx\\sqrt{-g}\\left(R-\\frac{4}{3}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi-V_E(\\phi)\\right)\\nonumber \\\\&-&\n\\frac{1}{16\\pi G_5} \\int_{\\partial\nM}d^4x\\sqrt{-\\gamma}\\Big[2K-{6\\over L}+ \\lambda_1 \\mathcal{R}+ \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{R}_{ab}\\mathcal{R}^{ab}+\\lambda_3 \\mathcal{R}^2+... \\Big],\\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$ undermined coefficients of counter\nterms \\cite{Henningson:1998gx} \\cite{Henningson:1998ey}\\cite{Balasubramanian:1999re}\\cite{Hyun:1998vg}\\cite{Emparan:1999pm}\\cite{Mann:1999pc}  $\\mathcal{R}$, $\\mathcal{R}_{ab}\\mathcal{R}^{ab}, \\mathcal{R}^2 $   to be worked out later. The first term of the last line in (\\ref{C2}) is Gibbons-Hawking\nterm $S_{\\text{GH}}$ and the remain terms are $S_{\\text{count}}$ related to cosmological constant and scalar\nfield. These coefficients\ncan be fixed by canceling the divergences of boundary momentum\ntensor. Here $K_{ij}$ and $K$ are respectively the extrinsic\ncurvature and its trace of the boundary $\\partial M$, $\\gamma_{ij}$\nis the induced metric on the boundary $\\partial M$. These quantities\nare defined as follows\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_{\\mu \\nu}&=&g_{\\mu \\nu} +n_{\\mu} n_{\\nu},\\\\\nK_{\\mu\\nu}&=&h^\\lambda_\\nu D_{\\lambda} n_{\\mu},\\\\\n\\gamma&=&\\det(\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu}),\\\\\nK&=&g^{\\mu\\nu}K_{\\mu\\nu},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\gamma_{\\mu \\nu}$ denotes the induced metric, $n_{\\mu}$\nstands for the normal direction to the boundary surface $\\partial M$\nas well as $D_{\\lambda}$ stands for covariant derivative. Finally, $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{ab}$ are the Ricci scalar and Ricci tensor for the\nboundary metric respectively. In generic cases, one should introduce higher powers of $\\mathcal{R}$ and  various combination of $\\mathcal{R}_{ab}$ to cancel\nthe total UV divergence. For massive and massless cases in this paper, we just only introduce $\\mathcal{R}$ to cancel all the UV divergence. That means we can\nset $\\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$ to be vanishing.\n\nIn the asymptotical AdS hyperbolic black hole, the boundary surface locates at $z=0$\nsurface, and usually one has to regularized it to a finite\n$z=\\epsilon$ surface. So we have the normalized normal vector\n$n_\\mu=\\frac{\\delta^\\mu_z}{\\sqrt{g_{zz}}}$.\n\n\n\nTo regulate the theory, we restrict to the region $z\\ge \\epsilon$\nand the surface term is evaluated at $z=\\epsilon$. The induced\nmetric is $\\gamma_{ij}=\\frac{\\tilde{L}^2}{\\epsilon^2}\ng_{ij}(x,\\epsilon)$, where the leading term of expansion of\n$g_{ij}(x,\\epsilon)$ with respect to $\\epsilon$ is the flat metric\n$g_{(0)}^{ij}$. Then the one point function of stress-energy tensor\nof the dual CFT is given by \\cite{KS}\\cite{SKS}\\cite{Nojiri:1998dh}\\cite{Nojiri:2000kh}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nT_{ij}&=&\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{-\\det g_{(0)}}}\\frac{\\delta I_{ren}}{\\delta\ng_{(0)}^{ij}}=\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to\n0}\\Big(\\frac{{L}^2}{\\epsilon^2}\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{-\\gamma}}\\frac{\\delta\nI_{ren}}{\\delta \\gamma^{ij}}\\Big). \\label{CFTET}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe finite part of boundary\nenergy-stress tensor is from the\n$O(\\epsilon^2)$ of the Brown-York tensor $T_{ij}$ on the\nboundary $z=\\epsilon$, with\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{BY}\nT_{ij}&=&-\\frac{1}{16 \\pi G_5}\\Big[K_{ij}-\\Big((K+{d-2\\over\nL})g_{ij}-\\lambda_1 \\mathcal{R}_{ij}-2\\lambda_2 \\mathcal{R}_{ik}\\mathcal{R}_{jk}+{\\lambda_1\\over 2}g_{ij}\\mathcal{R}-\n2 \\lambda_3 \\mathcal{R}_{ij}\\mathcal{R}\\nonumber\\\\&+&{1\\over 2}\\lambda_3 g_{ij}\\mathcal{R}^2-2 \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{R}^{kl}\\mathcal{R}_{ikjl}+\\lambda_2\\mathcal{R}_{j}^{k}\\mathcal{R}_{il}^{k l}\n+\\lambda_2\\mathcal{R}_{i}^{k}\\mathcal{R}_{jl}^{k l}+{\\lambda_2\\over 2}g_{ij}\\mathcal{R}_{kl}^{k m}\\mathcal{R}_{ln}^{ mn}\\nonumber\\\\&+& (2 \\lambda_3+\\lambda_2) \\nabla_{j}\\nabla_{i}\\mathcal{R}-\\lambda_2\\mathcal{R}_{ij;k}^{;k }\n-(2 \\lambda_3+{1\\over 2}\\lambda_2) g_{ij }\\mathcal{R}_{kl;m}^{kl; m}\\Big)\\Big],\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the massless scalar hair hyperbolic AdS black hole, the coefficients of counter terms can be\nfollowing\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\lambda_1&=&{1\\over 2},\\nonumber\\\\\n\\lambda_2&=&0,\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_3&=&0,\n\\end{eqnarray} where we have fixed these coefficients by removing the UV divergence $z\\rightarrow 0$ appeared in on-shell action of massless scalar.\nDirectly evaluate (\\ref{BY}) using (\\ref{CFTET}), we get \\begin{eqnarray}\nT_{tt}={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\Big(\\frac{3L}{8}-\\frac{3 f_4 L}{2}\\Big). \\label{ETGB}\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\subsubsection{Massive Scalar Cases}\nFor massive scalar, the total action will be different from massless cases. The main reason is that the UV behavior of massive scalar is different from the massless cases. The divergences in the UV region are very sensitive to UV behavior. In massive case, we will introduce following counter term to cook up well defined on-shell action.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{C22}\nI_{\\text{ren}}&=&S_{\\text{5D}}+\nS_{\\text{GH}}+S_{\\text{count}}\\nonumber\\\\&=&\\frac{1}{16 \\pi G_5}\n\\int_M d^5\nx\\sqrt{-g}\\left(R-\\frac{4}{3}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi-V_E(\\phi)\\right)\\nonumber \\\\&-&\n\\frac{1}{16\\pi G_5} \\int_{\\partial\nM}d^4x\\sqrt{-\\gamma}\\Big[2K-{6\\over L}+ \\lambda_{m1} \\mathcal{R}+ \\lambda_{m2}\\phi^2 +\\lambda_{m3}\\phi \\mathcal{R}+... \\Big],\\nonumber \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIn terms of (\\ref{CFTET}), the boundary energy momentum tensor would be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nT_{ij}&=&{1\\over 16\\pi G}\\Big[ K_{ij}-(K+{d-2\\over 2}-\\lambda_{m2}\\phi^2)g_{ij}+(\\lambda_{m3}\\phi+\\lambda_{m1})(\\mathcal{R}_{ij}-{1\\over 2}g_{ij}\\mathcal{R})\\Big]\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIn the massive scalar hair hyperbolic AdS black hole, the coefficients of count terms can be\nfollowing\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\lambda_{m1}&=&{1\\over 2},\\nonumber\\\\\n\\lambda_{m2}&=&{8\\over 3},\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_{m3}&=&{2 \\langle O_2\\rangle\\over 9},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\langle O_2\\rangle$ corresponds to expectation value of dual operator $O_2$ of massive scalar $\\phi$. We have fixed these coefficients by removing the UV divergence $z\\rightarrow 0$ appearing in on-shell action of massive scalar.\n\nDirectly evaluate (\\ref{BY}) using (\\ref{CFTET}), we get \\begin{eqnarray}\nT_{tt}={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\Big(-\\frac{3 f_4L}{2 L^2}-\\frac{\\langle O_2\\rangle^2 L}{6 }+\\frac{3L}{8 }\\Big). \\label{ETGB}\\end{eqnarray}\n\\subsection{The Difference of Free Energy}\nAfter introducing the counter term to remove the divergence of the action, we can work out\nthe on shell action which will be helpful to test the holographic phase structures. Later, we\nwill also make use of condensation of dual operator to get the flavor of phase transitions.\n\n\nFor massless scalar case, the on shell action can be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{\\text{5D-BH}}={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\Big(\\frac{3}{4}-f_4\\Big)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\nFor massive scalar case, the on shell action can be\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{\\text{5D-BH}}={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\Big(\\frac{3}{4}-f_4-\\frac{1}{45} 8 p_2^2-\\frac{28 p_{22} p_2}{75}-\\frac{416 p_{22}^2}{1125}\\Big)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere we have to turn off the the source $p_{22}$ to obtain the expectation value of dual operator in vacuum for later use.\n\n\n\n\\section{Phase Transitions }\nIn the proceeding section, we would like to study the stability of these hyperbolic AdS black hole solutions by calculating condensation of dual operator and free energy. We will show\ntemperature dependence behaviors of condensation of operators $O_1, O_2$ dual to massless and massive scalar respectively. Firstly, we will make use of free energy to study the stability of these new hyperbolic black hole solutions. In this section, we mainly focus on the constant modes in which we do not turn on the in-homogenous perturbation of these solutions. The constant mode means that the field configurations only depend on holographic direction $z$. We should say this analysis is not so solid and later we will turn to go further to check the stability of these solutions. In section \\ref{section7}, we will go back to the phase structures in these theories studied in this section in terms of linear perturbation.\n\\subsection{Condensation}\nIn this subsection, we will figure out all fields configurations and extract the condensation of dual operator $O$ of scalar field to see what will happen with changing related parameters, for example, temperature and coupling constant of scalar self-interaction. Basically, one can extract the condensation of dual operator by UV expansion of massless and massive scalar shown in Eq.(\\ref{sol1phi}) Eq.(\\ref{massivescalar}) in terms of AdS/CFT dictionary. The condensation will imply whether there is phase transition or not. Later, we will use free energy to confirm these phase transitions and determine the transition temperature.\n\\subsubsection{Massless Cases}\\label{masslessphasetransition}\nWe would like to introduce several deformations in massless scalar potential, for example, adding $\\phi^3, \\phi^4, \\phi^6$ terms to the potential. We mainly focus on obtaining condensation of the dual $\\Delta=4$ glueball operator $O_1$ with respect to temperature. We will see there exist phase transition in various deformations and how these deformations affect the phase transition in details.\n\nFirstly, we would like to calculate the condensation in massless scalar with potential like $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$. In fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-1}(a),\nwe have shown the condensation as a function of temperature. The different colored curves correspond to choose model parameter $\\nu_4$. With increasing $\\nu_4$, the condensation at same temperature will increase gradually. There is a transition temperature which is determined by that the condensation goes to zero. For each colored curve, the condensation is\ndouble valued function with respect to temperature from zero temperature to maximal temperature $T_{max}$. In fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-1}(b), we calculate free energy with respect to temperature and it shows that the dashed line part is unstable comparing with solid curve. That means the $T_{max}$ is phase transition temperature $T_c$ in terms of free energy. Below the transition temperature $T_c$, the condensation is a monodrome function of temperature. At the transition temperature, the condensation will jump from finite positive value to zero and the massless hairy black hole solution is unstable comparing with hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole. That is to say hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole is favored when $T\\geq T_c$. Up to this stage, we find the instability exists in this case.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{zeromass-1-OOO.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{zeromass-1-FFF.eps}\n\\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The condensation is as a function of temperature in massless scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$.}\\label{zerocondensation-1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nSecondly, we would like to calculate the condensation $O_1$ in massless scalar with potential like $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6\\phi ^6\\over L^2}$.\nIn fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-2}(a),\nwe have shown the condensation as a function of temperature. The different colored curves correspond to choose different model parameter $\\nu_6$ with fixing $\\nu_4$. With increasing $\\nu_6$, the condensation at same temperature will decrease gradually. There is a transition temperature which is determined by that the condensation goes to zero. For each colored curve, the condensation is double valued function with respect to temperature from zero temperature to maximal temperature $T_{max}$.\n In fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-2}(b), we calculate free energy with respect to temperature and it shows that the dashed line part is unstable comparing with solid curve in $T<T_{max}$. That means the $T_{max}$ is phase transition temperature $T_c$. Below the transition temperature $T_c$, the condensation is a monodrome function of temperature. At the transition temperature, the condensation will jump from finite positive value to zero and the massless hairy black hole solution is unstable comparing with hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole in $T>T_{max}$. That is also to say hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole is favored when $T\\geq T_c$. Below the transition temperature, the condensation is a monodrome function of temperature. At the transition temperature, the condensation will jump from finite positive value to zero. We can see that ${\\nu_6\\phi ^6\\over L^2}$ does not change the type of phase transition induced by ${\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{zeromass-2-OOO-various.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{zeromass-2-FFF-various.eps}\n\\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The condensation is as a function of temperature in massless scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6\\phi ^6\\over L^2}$.}\\label{zerocondensation-2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFinally, we would like to calculate the condensation in massless scalar with potential like $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_3\\phi ^3\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$.\nIn fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-3}(a), the condensation as a function of temperature has been presented. The different colored curves correspond to choose model parameter $\\nu_3$ with fixing $\\nu_4$. With increasing $\\nu_3$, the condensation at same temperature will decrease gradually. For each colored curve, the condensation is double valued function with respect to temperature from zero temperature to maximal temperature $T_{max}$.\n In fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-3}(b), we also calculate free energy with respect to temperature and it shows that the dashed line part is unstable comparing with solid curve. That means the $T_{max}$ is still phase transition temperature $T_c$ in this case. Below the transition temperature $T_c$, the condensation is a monodrome function of temperature. At the transition temperature, the condensation will jump from finite positive value to zero and the massless hairy black hole solution is unstable comparing with hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole. That is to say hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole is favored when $T\\geq T_c$. Below the transition temperature, the condensation is a monodrome function of temperature. At the transition temperature, the condensation will jump from finite positive value to zero. The deformation from ${\\nu_3\\phi ^3\\over L^2}$ does not change the type of phase transition induced by ${\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$ qualitatively.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{zeromass-3-OOO.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{zeromass-3-FFF.eps}\n\\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The condensation is as a function of temperature in massless scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_3\\phi ^3\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$.}\\label{zerocondensation-3}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn summary, we introduce three types special deformations like $\\phi^3, \\phi^4, \\phi^6$ in massless neutral scalar potential in the bulk. We calculate the condensation of dual operator of the scalar with respect to temperature. We find that there are phase transitions in deformed theories. We calculate the condensation as a function of temperature numerically and find the transition temperature. Further, we calculate the free energy to confirm the phase transitions. Finally, these phase transitions induced by three kinds of deformation are the same type qualitatively. Therefore, one can naturally expect that there are still same types of phase transitions in those cases with deformation like superposition of these three kinds of deformations. We will turn to be more rigid in section \\ref{section7} to check the stability of these solutions in the low temperature region $T<T_{c}$. In section \\ref{section7}, one can find that all these massless hyperbolic hairy AdS black hole are not stable. There exist more stabler solutions, which are in-homogenous solutions. Therefore, the phase transition mentioned in this section will break down and new phase structures will emerge.\n\n\\subsubsection{Massive Cases}\nIn this subsection, we would like to deform massive scalar potential by adding $\\phi^3, \\phi^4, \\phi^6$ terms. We mainly focus on obtaining condensation of the dual $\\Delta=2$ operator $O_2$ with respect to temperature. We expect that the phase structures may be changed due to choose different operator as an order parameter. We will see there exist phase transition in various deformations and how these deformations affect the phase transition order in details.\n\n\nFirstly, we will turn to study the condensation in massive scalar with potential like $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$.\nIn Fig.\\ref{condensation-1}(a), we have shown the condensation of dual operator as a function of temperature in several cases. Each case\ncorresponds to set different values of self-interaction coupling constants $\\nu_4$. In each case, there is a transition point when the condensation\ngoes to vanishing. That means the mass hair AdS hyperbolic black hole is more stable than vanishing condensation solution which is hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole in low temperature region. It implies that there should be a phase transition with increasing temperature in this system. Furthermore, the types of phase transition will\nbe changed with increasing $\\nu_4$, which shows that the ${\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$ deformation will play an important role to determine the transition types. In Fig.\\ref{condensation-1}, we increase $\\nu_4=-0.2, 0.0, 1.0$ gradually and find that transition temperature is independent on $\\nu_4$. Furthermore, there exists a critical value for $\\nu_{4c}$ between $\\nu_4=-1$ and $\\nu_4=-0.2$ . Crossing this critical point, the phase transition order will be changed in $\\nu_4< \\nu_{4c}$. In fig. \\ref{condensation-1}(b), the free energy will increase with temperature. All colored curves will converge to a one point which corresponds to transition temperature in $\\nu_4> \\nu_{4c}$. The transition temperature is the same as transition temperature given by fig. \\ref{condensation-1}(a). The black dashed line in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-1}(b) corresponds to free energy in hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole. In Fig.~\\ref{condensation-1}(b), the dominate phase should be hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole above the transition temperature. The free energy can continuously converge to the transition point in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-1}(b) with $\\nu_4> \\nu_{4c}$. But free energy will jump to the transition point with $\\nu_4< \\nu_{4c}$. That is also means the order of phase transition should change suddenly and the transition temperature will be $T_{max}$, for example, curves shown in $\\nu_4=-1.4, -1.2, -1.0$. This phenomenon is also consistent with a condensation jump from finite value to vanishing in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-1}(a).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-1-OOO-various.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-1-FFF-various.eps}\n\\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The condensation is as a function of temperature in massive scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$.}\\label{condensation-1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNow we will turn to study the condensation in massive scalar with potential like $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_6\\phi^6\\over L^2}$.\nWe introduce ${\\nu_6\\phi^6\\over L^2}$ deformation and to see what will happen for phase transition. In Fig.~\\ref{condensation-2}(a), one can see the condensation with\nrespect to temperature with choosing different values of coupling constant $\\nu_6$. With increasing $\\nu_6= 0.0, 2.0$, the condensation will monotonically decrease from\npositive finite value to vanishing. In $\\nu_6<0.0$ region, the condensation is multiple valued function of temperature as shown in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-2}(a) and there is a local maximal temperature $T_{max}$ and minimal temperature $T_{min}$ in each curve. For $\\nu_6= -0.1$, the condensation will decrease from $T=0$ to $T=T_{min}$ and it will jump to less finite positive value at $T_{min}$. From $T_{min}<T<T_{max}$, the condensation will become multivalued function of temperature. For $T\\geq T_{max}$, the condensation will decrease to zero continuously in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-2}(a). In Fig.~\\ref{condensation-2}(b), we have shown various free energy with respect to temperature with gradually changing the $\\nu_6$. We also find that free energy with $\\nu_6= 0, 2$ is monotonically increasing with temperature. They always continuously converge to the transition point $T_c$. The transition point is defined by vanishing of condensation. But in cases with $\\nu_6= -0.1$, the free energy is multiple valued function of temperature. For these cases, there are minimal temperatures $T_{mini}$ and local maximal temperature $T_{max}$. For $T>T_{c}$, hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole should be stable and there is no massive scalar hair black hole solution. In $T_{max}<T<T_{c}$ and $0< T< T_{min}$, massive scalar hair black hole is more stable than hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole. In $T_{min}<T<T_{max}$, the condensation of dual operator is a multiple valued function and the stable solution is marked by solid curve in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-2}(a)(b) in terms of comparing free energy. There is critical value $\\nu_{6c}$ such that $T_{min}=T_{max}$. Therefore, there are two types of phase transitions for $\\nu_6=-0.5$. The first one happens at $T_{max}$ and the condensation is not continuous function of temperature at $T_{max}$ with $\\nu_6<\\nu_{6c}$. The other one happens at $T_c$ and condensation goes to zero with $\\nu_6>\\nu_{6c}$.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-3-OOO-various-V6.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-3-FFF-various-V6.eps}\n\\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The condensation $O$ is as a function of temperature $T$ in massive scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_6\\phi^6\\over L^2}$.}\\label{condensation-2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn the third case, we will focus on the condensation with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_3 \\phi^3\\over L^2}$. In Fig.~\\ref{condensation-4}(a), we can find that the condensation will decrease from positive finite value to vanishing in $\\nu_3>\\nu_{3c}$ region. In our setup, $\\nu_{3c}=0$. In $\\nu_3<0$ region, the condensation will be multiple valued function of temperature. This case is much similar to first massive case. In this region, the transition order will be change. Because the condensation can not continuously decrease to zero at transition temperature and it will suddenly jump from positive finite value to zero. In \\ref{condensation-4}(b), we have shown the free energy as function of temperature. In $\\nu_3>0$ region, free energy is monotonically increasing with temperature, while free energy is multiple valued function of temperature in $\\nu_3<0$. That means the free energy can not converge to the transition temperature continuously, while massive hair black hole will jump to hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole at transition temperature. Roughly speaking, the phase transitions induced by ${\\nu_3 \\phi^3\\over L^2}$ is almost similar to ones induced by ${\\nu_4\\phi^4\\over L^2}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-4-OOO-various-V3.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-4-FFF-various-V3.eps}\n\\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The condensation $O$ is as a function of temperature $T$ in massive scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_3 \\phi^3\\over L^2}$.}\\label{condensation-4}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we would like to focus on the condensation in massive scalar with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6\\phi ^6\\over L^2}$. The main motivation to study this case is that we expect to find competitive mechanism between ${\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$ deformation and $ {\\nu_6 \\phi^6\\over L^2}$ deformation. In Fig.~\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6}(a), one can vary $\\nu_6$ with fixing $\\nu_4=1.0$ to see that the condensation will monotonically decrease to zero from low temperature to high temperature for $\\nu_6>\\nu_{6c}$. In $\\nu_4=1$ case, $\\nu_{6c}=0.0$ such that $T_{min}=T_{max}$. For fixing $\\nu_4$, one can tune $\\nu_6=\\nu_{6c}$ to be a solution in which $T_{max}$ will coincide with $T_{min}$. One can vary $\\nu_4$ to find corresponding $\\nu_{6c}$. While in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6}(b), we confirm that the hairy black hole solution is much stable than hyperbolic AdS-SW in $T_{max}<T<T_{c}$ and $0<T<T_{min}$ with $\\nu_6<\\nu_{6c}, \\nu_4=1$. Where $T_c$ is defined by the point where the condensation is vanishing in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6}(a) and $T_{min}, T_{max}$ are marked in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6}(a). In $T>T_{c}$, there is no stable hairy black hole solution for $\\nu_6>\\nu_{6c}$ and hyperbolic AdS-SW solution is stable one. In $\\nu_6<\\nu_{6c}$, the condensation will become multivalued function of temperature from $T_{min}<T<T_{max}$,. For $\\nu_6=-0.5$ example, the stable configuration in $0<T<T_{min}$ is the hairy black hole solution, while in $T>T_{c}>T_{min}$ is hyperbolic AdS-SW black solution. When $T_{min}<T<T_c<T_{max}$ as shown in Fig.~\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6}, there is a phase transition between two hairy AdS black holes and the condensation will jump from positive finite value to less positive finite value. Especially at $T_c$, there is phase transition between hairy black hole and hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole due to condensation goes to vanishing. These numerical studies show that there is competitive mechanism between ${\\nu_4\\phi ^4\\over L^2}$ deformation and $ {\\nu_6 \\phi^6\\over L^2}$ deformation. One can tune $\\nu_4, \\nu_6$ to see which phase is stable and what type of phase transition happens. One can set $\\nu_4=0$ and this numerical result will reproduce one in second massive case.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-3-OOO-various-V6-V4.eps}\n\\hspace*{0.1cm} \\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{mass-3-FFF-various-V6-V4.eps}\n\\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( a ) } \\hskip 4.5 cm \\textbf{( b )}\\\\\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The condensation $O$ is as a function of temperature $T$ in massive scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6\\phi ^6\\over L^2}$.}\\label{condensation-V4-1-V6}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nTo close this subsection, we would like to give a short summary. Here we have introduced various deformations in massive scalar potential and study these deformations effects on stability of hairy AdS hyperbolic black holes case by case. In each case, the condensation as a function of temperature implies that there exist phase transitions in deformed theories. The behavior of condensation and free energy with respect to temperature in $\\phi^3$ and $\\phi^4$ deformed theories will be similar to ones in the massless cases with $\\phi^3, \\phi^4, \\phi^6$ deformation. Comparing with Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m0-v4-1} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m0-v4-v6} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m0-v3-v4}, it has exotic behavior with respect to temperature in $\\phi^6$ deformed theories shown in Fig.\\ref{condensation-2} Fig.\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6}. The exotic behavior is induced by $\\phi^6$ deformation essentially. All these behaviors imply that there may exist phase transitions. Essentially, all these phase transitions mainly originate from the effective mass of scalar below the effective BF bound for the near horizon $AdS_2$. However, it is not enough to confirm the phase transitions by analyzing the condensation of dual operator and free energy. In section \\ref{section7}, we will see the hyperbolic hairy AdS black hole solutions will be stable in low temperature region $T<T_c$ when coupling constants live in specific regions. Otherwise, these solutions will not be stable anymore and there exist much more stabler in-homogenous solutions. We will see details in section \\ref{section7}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Instability for the Normalizable Mode}\\label{section7}\n\nPrevious discussions on the stability of different phases are mainly based on thermodynamical analysis with comparing free energy. Comparing free energy between constant solution and hyperbolic AdS-SW is not enough to make sure these new hyperbolic solutions are stable or not. To be more rigorous, in this section we will investigate the instability of these solutions under scalar perturbation $\\delta\\Phi(t,z,\\psi ,\\theta ,\\varphi)$. The wave function of $\\delta\\Phi(t,z,\\psi ,\\theta ,\\varphi)$ could be decomposed as\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{pmodes}\n\\delta\\Phi(t, z, \\psi ,\\theta ,\\varphi)=e^{\\omega t}\\delta\\phi(z)Y(\\psi ,\\theta ,\\varphi), \\nabla^2_{\\mathbf{H}_3}Y(\\psi ,\\theta ,\\varphi)=-\\lambda Y(\\psi ,\\theta ,\\varphi),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $Y$ the eigenfunction of Laplacian in certain manifold $\\Sigma$ and $\\lambda$ the corresponding eigenvalues. When $\\Sigma$ is just the hyperboloid $H_{d-2}$, $\\lambda$ has the lower bound $\\lambda>\\frac{(d-3)^2}{4}$. Here, we will consider the 5D case, so $d=5$ and $\\lambda>1$. More generally, when $\\Sigma$ is a non-trivial quotient of hyperboloid, then the lower bound of $\\lambda$ would be extended to $0$. Thus, below we will only consider $\\lambda>0$ and $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ for simplicity \\cite{Belin:2014lea} \\cite{Belin:2013dva}.\n\nUnder the ansatz Eq.(\\ref{pmodes}), the equation of motion for $\\delta\\phi$ could be derived as follows\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eom-pet}\n\\delta\\phi^{''}+(-\\frac{3}{z}+3A_e^{'}+\\frac{f^{'}}{f})\\delta\\phi^{'}+(\\frac{3e^{2A_e}}{8z^2 f}V^{''}(\\phi)-\\frac{\\omega^2}{f^2}+\\frac{\\lambda}{f})\\delta\\phi=0,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $A_e, f, \\phi$ are associated with background solutions. In our ansatz Eq.(\\ref{pmodes}), the time related part behaves as $e^{\\omega t}$. The black hole will be unstable if (\\ref{eom-pet}) has a solution with real and positive $\\omega^2$ with the\nfield satisfying specific boundary conditions at infinity and the horizon. Therefore, if there exist solutions with positive $\\omega^2$ in certain background solutions, then the background solutions are unstable. This unstability is induced by inhomogenous perturbation in boundary special direction. If one can not find such perturbative modes with positive $\\omega^2$, then the background solutions are stable at the level of linear perturbation. This is the key criterion to test the stability of these solutions. In principle, one should construct hairy black holes at the non-linear level which is considerably more difficult. In this paper, it is sufficient to demonstrate that an\ninstability exists by linear perturbation.\n\nThe leading expansion of $\\delta\\phi$ near the horizon $z=z_h$ could be derived from Eq.(\\ref{eom-pet}) as following\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\delta\\phi(z)=\\delta p_{h1} (z_h-z)^{\\frac{\\omega}{4\\pi T}}(1+...)+\\delta p_{h2}(z_h-z)^{-\\frac{\\omega}{4\\pi T}}(1+...),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\delta p_1, \\delta p_2$ the two integral constants of the second order derivative equation Eq.(\\ref{eom-pet}). Without loss of generality, we assume $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\omega^2}>0$, then the $\\delta p_{h1}$ mode tends to $0$ when $z$ approaches $z_h$, while the $\\delta p_{h2}$ mode is divergent near horizon. Thus, the near horizon boundary condition is easy to be set as $\\delta\\phi(z_h)=0$.\n\nFor the UV boundary condition, again, we could calculate the near boundary expansion of $\\delta\\phi$ from Eq.(\\ref{eom-pet}). It depends on the dimension of $\\phi$. For $\\Delta=2$ as example, the leading expansion is of the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\delta\\phi(z)=\\delta p^{2}_{01} z^2 \\log(z)+...+\\delta p^{(2)}_{02}z^2+....\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs in the background solutions, we will require the coefficient of $z^2\\log(z)$ to be $0$. For $\\Delta=4$, one can obtain the UV boundary condition as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\delta\\phi(z)=\\delta p^{(0)}_{0}+\\delta p^{(4)}_{0}z^4+....\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nIn general, only for certain groups of $(\\lambda, \\omega^2)$ the solutions of $\\delta\\phi$ could satisfy both the UV and IR boundary conditions simultaneously. We will try to find such kind of solutions under the background solutions solved in previous sections, and to see whether it is stable or not under the linear perturbation.\n\n\\subsection{Massless Scalar Cases}\nFirstly, we focus on the stability in the massless cases. In terms of previous arguments in last section, one just only studies the sign of $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ and we can test stability of these solutions solved in previous several sections.\n\nIn Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m0-v4-1} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m0-v4-v6} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m0-v3-v4}, we show the $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ as a function of temperature numerically with turning on the linear perturbation of hyperbolic black hole solution with $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}$ ,$V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6 \\phi^6\\over L^2}$ and $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_3 \\phi^3\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}$ respectively. In all these cases, one can see that $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ always positive from low to high temperature region. These solutions shown in Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-1} Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-2} Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-3} should be unstable configurations, although these configurations are much more stable than hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole with comparing free energy. One can see that there should exist in-homogenous black hole solutions which break the hyperbolic symmetry.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{w2-l0-m0-v4.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{$\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ as a function of temperature in massless scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}$ at the same parameter values as in Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-1}. }\\label{w2-l0-m0-v4-1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{w2-l0-m0-v4-v6.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{$\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ as a function of temperature in massless scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6 \\phi^6\\over L^2}$ at the same parameter values as in Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-2}. }\\label{w2-l0-m0-v4-v6}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{w2-l0-m0-v3-v4.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{$\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ as a function of temperature in massless scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}+{\\nu_3 \\phi^3\\over L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}$ at the same parameter values as in Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-3}. }\\label{w2-l0-m0-v3-v4}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Massive Scalar Cases}\nIn this subsection, we turn to focus on the stability of new hyperbolic black hole solutions with massive scalar potentials. Here we have studied four cases which are shown in Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v4} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v6} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v3} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v4-v6}. Here we summarize final results in the following.\nIn Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v4} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v6} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v3} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v4-v6}, we show the $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ as a function of temperature numerically with turning on the linear perturbation of hyperbolic black hole solution with $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}$ ,$V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_6 \\phi^6\\over L^2}$, $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_3 \\phi^3\\over L^2}$ and $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6 \\phi^6\\over L^2}$ respectively. For massive scalar cases, there are something new presented. Up to linear perturbative analysis, some solutions are stable. For example, as shown in Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v4}, we can tune $v_4$ gradually and then we can find a critical value of $v_4=0$. Once $v_4>0$, $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ are always negative definite function of temperature and which also means $v_4>0$ these solutions found in Fig.\\ref{condensation-1} might be stable at level of linear perturbation analysis. The phase transition shown in Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v6} might truly happen. Such kind of phenomenon also happens in Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v6}. One can also tune the $v_6$ gradually to find the critical value of $v_6=0$. When $v_6$ becomes positive, one can not find positive definite $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ which implies that solutions with positive $v_6$ might be also stable and phase transition might happen in Fig.\\ref{condensation-2}. In Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v3}, one can also tune the $v_3$ gradually to find critical value $v_3=0$ and similar story will happen as shown in Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v4} Fig.\\ref{w2-l0-m2-v6}. Finally, we consider more complicated situation with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}+{\\nu_6 \\phi^6\\over L^2}$. For simplifying our study, we just fix $v_4=1$ and gradually tune $v_6$ to obtain the critical value $v_6=0$ such that there is no positive $\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ existing in the black hole solution. We expect that the solutions found in Fig.\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6} with positive $v_6$ are stable and the phase transition might really happen.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\epsfxsize=6.5 cm \\epsfysize=5.5 cm \\epsfbox{w2-l0-m2-v4.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{$\\omega^2(\\lambda=0)$ as a function of temperature in massive scalar case with potential $V(\\phi )= -{12\\over L^2}-{16 \\phi ^2\\over 3L^2}+{\\nu_4 \\phi^4\\over L^2}$ at the same parameter values as in Fig.\\ref{condensation-1}.

Before we comment on this connection, we would like to brief review the replica trick in various aspects as a starting point of this section. In the recent literature, many progresses of calculation of Renyi Entropy have been achieved. Especially, Renyi entropy of a spherical entangling surface in field theories can be evaluated the thermal entropy on dual hyperbolic AdS black holes. Finally, we comment on how the instability of hyperbolic AdS black holes will induce a phase transition in dual field theory by holographic Renyi Entropy.\n\\subsection{Replica and Renyi Entropy}\nEntanglement entropy (EE) and the entanglement R\\'enyi entropy (ERE) are very helpful quantities to study phase transitions in QFTs.\nThe standard approach to calculate entanglement entropy in field theory is called replica trick \\cite{Callan:1994py}\\cite{Calabrese:2004eu}\\cite{Calabrese:2005zw}. Recently, this approach has been widely used in field theory and holography\\cite{Ryu:2006bv}\\cite{Ryu:2006ef}\\cite{Lewkowycz:2013nqa}\\cite{Song:2016pwx}.  The ERE for vacuum in various situations \\cite{Klebanov:2011uf}\\cite{Nishioka:2013haa}\\cite{Agon:2013iva}\\cite{Huang:2014gca}\\cite{Hama:2014iea} has been studied . More recently, the ERE for local excited states\nin CFTs have been extensively investigated in \\cite{Nozaki:2014hna}\\cite{Nozaki:2014uaa} \\cite{He:2014mwa}\\cite{Caputa:2014vaa}\\cite{Guo:2015uwa}\\cite{Chen:2015usa}\\cite{Nozaki:2015mca}. In string theory, \\cite{He:2014gva} tried to use replica trick to calculate entanglement entropy associated to black hole entropy in string theory.\n\nIn holography, the replica approach should start with calculating the partition function on n-fold cover of the background geometry. If one want to construct the structure for\nboundary CFT in terms of holography, it is inevitable to produce a conical singularity in the bulk. It is hard to resolve the bulk singularity without\ncompletely understanding the string theory or quantum gravity in the AdS bulk. In \\cite{Myers:2010xs}\\cite{Myers:2010tj}, authors have\ngiven a preliminary derivation of holographic Renyi entropy and \\cite{Casini:2011kv} clarify this construction and extend this to more general spherical entangling\nsurfaces in boundary CFT which is put on $R\\times S^{d-1}$. These pioneer studies allow us to calculate the Renyi entropy of a spherical entangling surface by evaluating the thermal entropy on the hyperbolic cylinder $R\\times H^{d-1}$. The essential new ingredient is that we should know hyperbolic AdS black hole solutions. Applying this approach, there are many extending studies \\cite{Belin:2013uta}\\cite{Belin:2014mva}\\cite{Brown:2015bva}.\n\\subsection{Spherical Renyi Entropy as Thermal Entropy}\nA holographic calculation of Renyi entropy for a\nspherical entangling surface is derived in \\cite{Casini:2011kv}\\cite{Myers:2010xs}\\cite{Myers:2010tj}. Following the this construction, the\ndensity matrix is thermal and we can write the $q$'th\npower of $\\rho$ as following\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n \\rho^{q}=U^{-1}\\,{\\exp\\left[-q H/T_0\\right]\\over Z(T_0)^q}\\,U \\quad{\\rm\n where}\\ \\ Z(T_0)\\equiv \\textrm{tr}\\left[e^{-H/T_0}\\right]\\,.\n \\end{eqnarray} where $q$ is integer number.\nThe unitary transformation $U$ and its inverse will be\ncanceled with taking the trace of this expression. Hence the trace of $q$ th power of density matrix is\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\textrm{tr}\\left[\\,\\rho^{\\,q}\\right] = {Z(T_0/q)\\over Z(T_0)^q}.\n \\end{eqnarray}\nWith using the definition of the free energy of dual black hole, i.e. $F(T)=-T\\log\nZ(T)$, the corresponding Renyi entropy becomes\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n S_q ={q\\over(1-q)T_0}\\left( F(T_0)-F(T_0/q)\\right).\n \\end{eqnarray}\nin terms of derivation\\cite{Casini:2011kv}\\cite{Myers:2010xs}\\cite{Myers:2010tj}.\nFurther using $S=-\\partial F/\\partial T$, this\nexpression can be rewritten as\n \\begin{eqnarray}\nS_q = {q\\over q-1} {1\\over T_0}\\, \\int_{T_0/q}^{T_0}\nS_{\\textrm{\\tiny {therm}}}(T)\\, dT\\,,\n \\label{finalfor111}\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $S_q$ is the Renyi entropy while $S_{\\text{thermal}}(T)$ denotes\nthe thermal entropy of the CFT on $R\\times H^{d-1}$. The entanglement entropy can be\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n S_{\\text{EE}}=\\lim_{q\\to 1}S_q = S_\\text{thermal}(T_0)\\,.\n \\label{lim1}\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwith $T_0$ given by $ {1\\over 2\\pi R}$. $R$ is the curvature scale on the hyperbolic spatial slices $H^{d-1}$ matching the radius of the original spherical entangle surface, $R$.\n\nWe can compute the R\\'{e}nyi entropy from these thermal entropies, via (\\ref{finalfor111})\n \\begin{eqnarray}\nS_{n}={n\\over n-1}{1\\over T_{0}}\n\\left(\n\\int_{T_{0}/{n}}^{T_{cri}}S^{Eh}_{\\text{thermal}}(T)dT\n+\n\\int_{T_{cri}}^{T_{0}}S^{E}_{\\text{thermal}}(T)dT\n\\right),\n \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $S^{Eh}_{\\text{thermal}}(T)$ is the entropy of the hairy black hole and\n$S^{E}_{\\text{thermal}}(T)$ is the entropy of the Einstein black hole.\nIn terms of above formula, the R{\\'e}nyi entropy as a function of $n$.\nBecause the derivative of the thermal entropy with respect to the temperature is discontinuous, the second derivative with respect to $n$ of the R{\\'e}nyi entropy is discontinuous. Such kind of discontinuous is closely related to instability of hyperbolic AdS black hole. Such instability has been carefully studied in section 6 and section 7. Therefore, the discontinuous of R{\\'e}nyi entropy implies a phase transition in dual field theory by holography. In order to determine the\nprecise value of $n_c$ at which this transition occurs, one should study numerically\nthe scalar wave equation within the black hole background as shown in \\cite{Belin:2013uta}\\cite{Belin:2014mva}. The critical temperature is defined by $T_{cri}={1\\over 2n_c\\pi R}$. Up to now, we completely get the hairy hyperbolic AdS black holes. Due to presence of condensation dual to scalar, the conformal transformation will break down in the whole background and one may not identify the R{\\'e}nyi entropy as the thermal entropy of hyperbolic AdS black hole generally. However, one can perturbatively extract R{\\'e}nyi entropy near transition point from hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole to hairy hyperbolic AdS black holes. Our studies will give us some insights on the R{\\'e}nyi entropy in dual field theory.\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Discussions}\nIn this paper, we have constructed various new hyperbolic asymptotic AdS gravity solutions in ED system numerically. Motivated by studying ERE with spherical entangling surface in deformed CFTs, we work out the background with introducing series powers of neutral scalar in scalar potential. In this paper, we just focus on potential with $\\phi^3, \\phi^4, \\phi^6$ or some superpositions of them. Especially, we only focus on two kinds of special scalar potentials. The one is massless scalar with higher powers of scalar self interaction and the other is that we choose square of the scalar mass to be $-3$. In terms of AdS/CFT, the first kind of scalar corresponds to gluon sector in gauge field theory side and the other scalar is dual to chiral condensation in field theory side. In general, to calculate the ERE with complicated entanglement surface is very hard. For spherical entanglement surface, one can make use of proposals \\cite{Casini:2011kv}\\cite{Myers:2010xs}\\cite{Myers:2010tj} to relate the ERE to the thermal entropy in hyperbolic space. That means once you know the hyperbolic asymptotic AdS solutions, you can obtain the ERE with spherical entangling surface in dual CFTs. We have shown the configuration of these new hyperbolic AdS solutions and also extract the condensation of operators which dual to massless and massive scalars respectively. Through studying condensation with respect to temperature, they give us insight that there exist phase transitions. We list the well defined boundary energy momentum tensor by introducing proper boundary counter terms in each solution. With these counter terms, the finite free energy can be achieved. We just compare free energy between the new hyperbolic AdS solutions and hyperbolic AdS-SW solution to check the stability of these solutions. And then, to be more rigid, we turn on in-homogenous perturbation on these new hyperbolic AdS black holes to study the stability. We tune the potential parameters to figure out the stable region for potential parameters in these solutions, for example, the coefficients of the cubic, quartic and sextic scalar interactions $v_3, v_4, v_6$. For massless scalar cases, we can not find stable solutions with turning on $\\phi^3,\\phi^4,\\phi^6$ in scalar potential respectively. Therefore, we can not safely say phase transition shown in Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-1} Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-2} Fig.\\ref{zerocondensation-3} really happens. There must exist stable solution with in-homogenous structure. For massive scalar cases with positive potential parameters $v_3, v_4, v_6$ respectively, $\\phi^3,\\phi^4$ will induce similar phase transition qualitatively shown in Fig.\\ref{condensation-1} Fig.\\ref{condensation-4}, while $\\phi^6$ term in scalar potential will induce different kind phase transition in Fig.\\ref{condensation-2}. If one turns on superposition of $\\phi^3,\\phi^4$ and $\\phi^6$ in scalar potential, there exists competitive mechanism between phase transitions induced by $\\phi^3,\\phi^4$ and $\\phi^6$ in Fig.\\ref{condensation-V4-1-V6}. However, when we choose negative potential parameters $v_3, v_4, v_6$ respectively, our studies show that all these black hole solutions are not stable ones. With negative potential parameters $v_3, v_4, v_6$, there may exist in-homogenous solutions which much more stable than corresponding hyperbolic AdS black hole solutions. Finally, the ERE can also be obtained in terms of proposals \\cite{Casini:2011kv}\\cite{Myers:2010xs}\\cite{Myers:2010tj}. Further, we comment on ERE also implies phase transitions which has something do with instability of these new hyperbolic AdS solutions.  Once we know the phase structures of various black hole solutions, we make use of \\cite{Casini:2011kv}\\cite{Myers:2010xs}\\cite{Myers:2010tj} to comment on the spherical entanglement entropy in the dual field theory. In this sense, the stability of these black hole solutions is closely related to the spherical ERE in holographic dual CFTs and it gives some insight of phase transitions in dual field theory.\n\nIn this paper, we just focus on massless and massive scalar cases with higher powers of self interaction in potentials. In general, such kinds of deformation will lead to various types of phase transitions which are highly sensitive to the operators chosen and types of deformations. ERE can be also regarded as an order parameter to give some insight on phase transitions in dual field theories.\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nWe are grateful to Janet Hung, Li Li, S.~Matsuura, Tadashi Takayanagi and Stefan Theisen for very useful conversations and correspondences.

\\cite{Maldacena:1997re}\\cite{Gubser:1998bc}\\cite{Witten:1998qj}\\cite{Aharony:1999ti}, where they are dual to finite temperature states. Dynamical\nand thermodynamical stability properties provide a novel window on the phase\nstructure of the dual CFTs. In holographic approaches to condensed matter physics the\ninstability of a black hole to the condensation of scalar hair is dual to a superconducting\nphase transition \\cite{Hartnoll:2008vx}\\cite{Hartnoll:2008kx}.\n\nWe will focus on the instability of hyperbolic AdS black holes and finally comment on holographic Renyi entropy. There are many hyperbolic AdS black holes, which were\nconstructed in \\cite{Aminneborg:1996iz}\\cite{Mann:1996gj}\\cite{Mann:1997zn}\\cite{Emparan:1999gf}\\cite{Emparan:1998he}\\cite{Birmingham:1998nr}. In \\cite{Dias:2010ma},\nit was shown that static black holes with hyperbolic horizons can become unstable to the formation of uncharged scalar hair on the horizon of the black hole due to the presence of an extremal limit with near-horizon geometry $AdS_2 \\times H^3$  \\cite{Robinson59}\\cite{Bertotti59}\\cite{Bardeen:1999px}\\cite{Brihaye:2011hm}. Further, authors of \\cite{Belin:2014lea} introduced a topological black hole with a minimal coupled scalar field of negative mass-square and showed this new stability appeared. In \\cite{Belin:2013dva}, they mapped the instability of this gravity solution to the phase transition happened in dual CFTs by holographic Renyi entropy. In \\cite{Belin:2014mva}, they investigated charged hyperbolic black holes, which became unstable to presence of scalar hair at sufficiently low temperature. Such kind of instability is the same as the holographic superconducting instability\nin boundary hyperbolic space. In summary, scalar fields with masses below the effective Breitenlohner-Freedman bound for the near-horizon $AdS_2$ will become unstable at sufficient low temperatures. This happens for charged and uncharged black holes; for AdS black holes with spherical horizons, such instabilities occur at finite chemical potential. When the mass of scalar field is below this bound, the black hole becomes unstable and will decay to a hairy black hole solution. The corresponding boundary operator acquires a non-zero expectation value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we have constructed a series of generic hyperbolic AdS black holes with neutral self interaction scalar. More precisely, in this system, we introduce series of specific powers of scalar in scalar potential. In \\cite{Belin:2013dva}, the authors showed that there was an instability in massive scalar hariy hyperbolic AdS black hole. The instability would induce a phase transition and entanglement Renyi entropy (ERE) also confirmed the phase transition. In our setup, we introduce higher powers of scalar self-interactions which correspond to deformation of CFTs. We start with the generic gravity setup and see what will happen. Firstly, we work out these gravity solution in UV region which will be useful to extract UV asymptotic AdS boundary condition. Finally, we can find hyperbolic AdS black hole solution numerically in various scalar potentials. In terms of that the EE for the spherical region of CFT is equivalent to the thermal entropy of the CFTs on the hyperbolic cylinder. This thermal entropy can be translated to the horizon entropy of an appropriate black hole with hyperbolic boundary. Basing on these hyperbolic AdS hairy black holes, we can make use of this dictionary to obtain the ERE in dual deformed CFTs. ERE obtained in our setup show that there are instabilities inducing phase transitions in dual CFTs. We also extract the condensation of dual operator with respect to temperature in each solution. The condensation of dual operator confirms that the phase transition might happen. To make sure of the phase transitions, we compare the free energy between the hyperbolic scalar hairy AdS black hole solutions (HSHAdS) and hyperbolic AdS-SW black hole to reveal the transition. Further, we turn on the in-homogenous linear perturbation to test the stability of HSHAdS and the stability condition highly constrains the potential parameters presented in the massive and massless scalar potential. We will give some explicit examples to show what kinds of scalar potential will give stable HSHAdS. Finally, one can make use of the stability to obtain the phase structure of these theories roughly. In terms of that EE for the spherical region of CFT can be calculated by thermal entropy of HSHAdS, the ERE also implies the phase transition.\n\n\nAn overview of the remainder of the paper is as follows: in section 2, we firstly set up the gravity which is our starting point. In section 3, we will list the asymptotic AdS boundary behavior which is controlled by Einstein equations for massless and massive scalar respectively. These UV behaviors are useful to obtain the numerical solutions. In section 4, we show various new hyperbolic scalar hairy AdS black hole solutions. In section 5, we study the boundary energy momentum tensor of these solutions with introducing various of boundary counter terms in massless and massive scalars respectively. Further, we evaluate the free energy of these solutions. In section 6, through above numerical analysis, we found that there are interesting phase transitions in deformed CFTs. We make use of condensation of dual operators and free energy of each solution to confirm phase transition will really happen in deformed CFTs. In section 6, we have demonstrated that the hyperbolic black holes are unstable and Renyi entropies show a phase transition. Therefore, in section 7, we turn to the physical case of these models which are normalizable on hyperboloid. In section 8, we will devote to conclusions and discussions.\n\n\n\\section{Gravity Setup}\\label{gravity-setup}\nThe gravity action in 5D spacetime in Einstein frame is\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\label{minimal-Einstein-action}\nS_{5D}=\\frac{1}{16 \\pi G_5} \\int d^5 x\n\\sqrt{-g}\\left(R-\\frac{4}{3}\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi-V(\\phi)\\right).\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S_{5D}=\\frac{1}{16\\pi G_{5}}\\int d^{5}x\\sqrt{-g}\\left(R-\\frac{4}{3}\\partial_{%&#10;\\mu}\\phi\\partial^{\\mu}\\phi-V(\\phi)\\right).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>5</mn></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><msup><mi>d</mi><mn>5</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msqrt><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msqrt><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msub><mo>\u2202</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mo>\u2202</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
