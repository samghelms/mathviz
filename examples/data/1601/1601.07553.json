With a particle mass restricted to the keV range, sterile neutrinos are furthermore a prime candidate for warm DM, characterised by suppressed matter perturbations at the smallest observable scales. In this paper we take a critical look at the validity of the resonant scenario in the context of constraints from structure formation. We compare predicted and observed number of Milky-Way satellites and we introduce a new method to generalise existing Lyman-$\\alpha$ limits based on thermal relic warm DM to the case of resonant sterile neutrino DM. The tightest limits come from the Lyman-$\\alpha$ analysis, excluding the entire parameter space (at 2-$\\sigma$ confidence level) still allowed by X-ray observations. Constraints from Milky-Way satellite counts are less stringent, leaving room for resonant sterile neutrino DM most notably around the suggested line signal at 7.1 keV.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\end{titlepage}\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:intro}Introduction}\nDespite enormous efforts in both fields particle physics and cosmology, the nature and composition of dark matter (DM) is still largely unknown. Up to date, the most popular DM candidate, the lightest stable particle from supersymmetry (SUSY), has neither be found via direct \\cite{Aprile:2012nq,Akerib:2013tjd} nor indirect detection \\cite{Adriani:2013uda,Ackermann:2015zua}, nor has any convincing sign of SUSY been established with particle colliders \\cite{Aad:2014vma,Khachatryan:2014qwa}.\n\nIn this situation it is quite natural to search for alternative DM candidates outside of the SUSY framework. A very promising candidate is the sterile neutrino. Adding a family of sterile singlets to the neutrino sector consists of a simple and natural extension of the standard model of particle physics. Sterile neutrinos act as right-handed counterpart to the left-handed active neutrinos and they may provide a natural framework for the observed non-zero masses of the active neutrinos via the seesaw mechanism\\footnote{Three sterile singlets are required to solve both the neutrino mass and the dark matter problem \\cite{Kusenko:2009up}.}.\n\nThe only coupling of sterile neutrinos with standard model particles is via flavour mixing to active neutrinos. Sterile neutrino DM is therefore most naturally produced by the {\\it freeze-in} mechanism, i.e. the DM abundance is gradually build up from the active neutrinos which are part of the primordial plasma. This most minimal production mechanism has first been advocated in a paper by Dodelson \\& Widrow (DW) from the early nineties \\cite{Dodelson:1993je} (but see also \\cite{Barbieri:1989ti}). However, the DW mechanism produces rather large particle momenta and has been shown to be in conflict with either Lyman-$\\alpha$ observations or X-ray data, depending on the particle mass \\cite{Seljak:2006qw,Viel:2006kd}.\n\nIn the case of a significant lepton asymmetry of the primordial plasma, sterile neutrinos can be produced resonantly, requiring smaller mixing angles and yielding significantly colder momenta. This has first been pointed out by Shi \\& Fuller (SF) \\cite{Shi:1998km} and is usually referred to as the \\emph{resonant} or SF production mechanism. Resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are believed to evade the strong constraints from Lyman-$\\alpha$ observations and are considered an attractive DM candidate \\cite{Boyarsky:2009ix}. They are furthermore one of the cornerstones of the \\emph{Neutrino Minimal Standard Model} ($\\nu$MSM) which is a framework attempting to solve the dark matter, the baryon asymmetry, and the nonzero neutrino mass problems by adding only three additional sterile neutrinos to the standard model \\cite{Asaka:2005an,Asaka:2005pn,Canetti:2012kh}. \n\nIn terms of structure formation, there are numerous studies putting forward limits for the non-resonant scenario \\cite{Seljak:2006qw,Viel:2006kd,Polisensky:2010rw,deSouza:2013hsj,Kennedy:2013uta,Inoue:2014jka,Menci:2016eww}, but only very few for resonant sterile neutrino DM~\\cite{Horiuchi:2015qri,Lovell:2015psz}. The main reason for the lack of competitive constraints is the spiky nature of momentum distributions due to the resonance, which leads to a non-trivial suppression of perturbations at small scales, making a thorough statistical analysis a challenging task. \n\nIn this paper we take a fresh look at constraints from structure formation and how they affect resonant sterile neutrino DM. We develop a method to apply existing Lyman-$\\alpha$ limits, based on the non-resonant scenario, to the more general case of resonant sterile neutrino DM. Furthermore, we compute constraints from Milky-Way satellite counts, using a method which allows for arbitrarily shaped power spectra~\\cite{Schneider:2013ria,Schneider:2014rda}.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Sec.~\\ref{sec:production} we summarise the resonant production mechanism and give examples of typical momentum distributions. Sec.~\\ref{sec:Xrays} provides an overview of recent constraints from X-ray observations. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:structform} we take a closer look at limits imposed by structure formation from the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and Milky-Way satellite counts. We use these limits to provide constraints on the sterile neutrino parameter space in Sec.~\\ref{sec:results}, and we conclude in Sec.~\\ref{sec:conclusions}.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:production}Resonant sterile neutrino production}\nIn a minimal setup sterile neutrinos are produced via oscillation with active neutrinos (with a given vacuum mixing angle $\\theta$) which are weakly interacting and therefore part of the primordial plasma. In the presence of a significant primeval lepton asymmetry, production via mixing has been shown to happen resonantly, which means that sterile neutrino DM is build up more efficiently opening up the parameter space towards smaller mixing angles \\cite{Shi:1998km}. The resulting momentum distribution from resonant production is very different from a Fermi-Dirac distribution (naturally obtained for DM scenarios with thermal decoupling) often exhibiting colder average momenta. The momentum distribution of a given DM scenario affects the perturbations in the early universe via the free-streaming effect \\cite{Lesgourgues:2011rh} and has therefore an influence on structure formation.\n\nFor the case of collisional dominated neutrino interactions, the production of sterile singlets can be written in terms of the Boltzmann equation \\cite{Abazajian:2001nj,Kishimoto:2008ic,Venumadhav:2015pla}\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{boltzmann}\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}f_{\\rm sn}(p,t)-H p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}f_{\\rm sn}(p,t) = \\Gamma(\\nu\\rightarrow \\nu_s;p,t) \\left[f_{\\nu}(p,t)-f_{\\rm sn}(p,t)\\right],\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}f_{\\rm sn}(p,t)-Hp\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}f_{\\rm&#10;sn%&#10;}(p,t)=\\Gamma(\\nu\\rightarrow\\nu_{s};p,t)\\left[f_{\\nu}(p,t)-f_{\\rm sn}(p,t)%&#10;\\right],\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mo>\u2202</mo><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>sn</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>H</mi><mi>p</mi><mfrac><mo>\u2202</mo><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></mfrac><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>sn</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo>\u2192</mo><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>;</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>\u03bd</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>sn</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07553.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $f_{\\rm sn}(p,t)$ and $f_{\\nu}(p,t)$ are the sterile and active neutrino distribution functions.

Form the left the parameter space is fundamentally restricted by the Tremain-Gunn bound \\cite{Tremaine:1979we,Boyarsky:2008ju} (at $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim 1$ keV, outside of the plot) and from the right it is limited by the non-detection of emission lines from X-ray observations (solid and dashed thick black lines representing a tight and a more conservative estimate, see Sec.~\\ref{sec:Xrays} for more details). \n\nThe colour map of Fig.~\\ref{fig:xmean} shows the average momenta (divided by the photon temperature) from the momentum distributions calculated with {\\tt sterile-dm} (interpolating between values on a grid covering the parameter space).

The coolest spectra are found roughly one order of magnitude below the line of non-resonant production. This is in agreement with estimates from Ref.~\\cite{Boyarsky:2009ix}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\center{\n\\includegraphics[width=.32\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/dist_ms7.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.32\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/dist_ms10.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.32\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/dist_ms15.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:dis}Momentum distribution functions of resonantly produced sterile neutrinos.

However, a detailed investigation of the free streaming effect requires knowledge of the full momentum distribution. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:dis} we show the momentum distributions of selected scenarios representing three different values for the particle mass (left: $m_{\\rm sn}=7.1$ keV; centre: $m_{\\rm sn}=10$ keV; right: $m_{\\rm sn}=15$ keV) and various mixing angles (colours). The model with the largest mixing angle in every panel corresponds to the non-resonant scenario and has a momentum distribution with a shape very close to the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Decreasing the mixing angles (i.e. increasing the lepton asymmetry) first leads to a shift of the distributions towards colder momenta until a turnover point where the distributions get warmer again. The model with the smallest mixing angle in each panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:dis} has a momentum distribution which is even slightly warmer than the corresponding non-resonant distribution. This behaviour confirms the results of the average momenta shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:xmean}.\n\nThere are several possible shortcomings of the calculation performed with {\\tt sterile-dm}, which we now briefly discuss. First of all the code is restricted to a single sterile singlet and only considers oscillation with the muon-neutrino ignoring mixing with other flavours\\footnote{The authors of Ref.~\\cite{Ghiglieri:2015jua} showed that similar distributions may be obtained for other flavour mixings, at least for a particle mass around $m_{\\rm sn}=7.1$ keV.}. Second, the calculation is based on the semi-classical Boltzmann formalism which is only accurate if collisions dominate the neutrino interactions, i.e. if $\\Delta(T)\\sin^22\\theta/D(T)<1$ \\cite{Venumadhav:2015pla}. We have checked that this is the case for all relevant parts of the parameter space. \n\n\n\nFurther possible error sources are uncertainties in the calculations of neutrino opacities and the lepton asymmetry evolution during the quark-hadron transition. However, they do not seem to affect the sterile neutrino momentum distributions at a significant level (as shown in Ref.~\\cite{Venumadhav:2015pla}).\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:Xrays}X-ray observations}\nSterile neutrino DM is expected to decay radiatively into an active neutrino $\\nu$ and a photon $\\gamma$ with energy $E_{\\gamma}=m_{\\rm sn}/2$. This leads to a line-signal which can be searched for with X-ray surveys. The decay rate \\cite{Palazzo:2007gz}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 9135, "prevtext": "\nwhere $f_{\\rm sn}(p,t)$ and $f_{\\nu}(p,t)$ are the sterile and active neutrino distribution functions.

However, a detailed investigation of the free streaming effect requires knowledge of the full momentum distribution. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:dis} we show the momentum distributions of selected scenarios representing three different values for the particle mass (left: $m_{\\rm sn}=7.1$ keV; centre: $m_{\\rm sn}=10$ keV; right: $m_{\\rm sn}=15$ keV) and various mixing angles (colours). The model with the largest mixing angle in every panel corresponds to the non-resonant scenario and has a momentum distribution with a shape very close to the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Decreasing the mixing angles (i.e. increasing the lepton asymmetry) first leads to a shift of the distributions towards colder momenta until a turnover point where the distributions get warmer again. The model with the smallest mixing angle in each panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:dis} has a momentum distribution which is even slightly warmer than the corresponding non-resonant distribution. This behaviour confirms the results of the average momenta shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:xmean}.\n\nThere are several possible shortcomings of the calculation performed with {\\tt sterile-dm}, which we now briefly discuss. First of all the code is restricted to a single sterile singlet and only considers oscillation with the muon-neutrino ignoring mixing with other flavours\\footnote{The authors of Ref.~\\cite{Ghiglieri:2015jua} showed that similar distributions may be obtained for other flavour mixings, at least for a particle mass around $m_{\\rm sn}=7.1$ keV.}. Second, the calculation is based on the semi-classical Boltzmann formalism which is only accurate if collisions dominate the neutrino interactions, i.e. if $\\Delta(T)\\sin^22\\theta/D(T)<1$ \\cite{Venumadhav:2015pla}. We have checked that this is the case for all relevant parts of the parameter space. \n\n\n\nFurther possible error sources are uncertainties in the calculations of neutrino opacities and the lepton asymmetry evolution during the quark-hadron transition. However, they do not seem to affect the sterile neutrino momentum distributions at a significant level (as shown in Ref.~\\cite{Venumadhav:2015pla}).\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:Xrays}X-ray observations}\nSterile neutrino DM is expected to decay radiatively into an active neutrino $\\nu$ and a photon $\\gamma$ with energy $E_{\\gamma}=m_{\\rm sn}/2$.

The excess, being consistent with a line feature, was speculated to originate from the decay of a $m_{\\rm sn}=7.1$ keV sterile neutrino. Both the presence of the suggested signal and it's interpretation are disputed. First of all, the excess has not been found in dwarf galaxy observations \\cite{Malyshev:2014xqa,Anderson:2014tza,Jeltema:2015mee,Ruchayskiy:2015onc}. Furthermore, it was argued that the signal could arise due to an incomplete subtraction of atomic lines \\cite{Jeltema:2014qfa,Phillips:2015wla} and that it does not have the right morphology expected by the DM profile \\cite{Urban:2014yda,Carlson:2014lla} (although both criticisms have been challenged as well \\cite{Boyarsky:2014ska,Iakubovskyi:2015dna}). \n\nCurrently, it seems very hard to draw definite conclusions from the status of the emission line, as poor statistics leave room for interpretation. However, upcoming X-ray surveys like \\emph{ASTRO-H} will improve the situation and could potentially clarify the origin of the emission line \\cite{Iakubovskyi:2014yxa,Neronov:2015kca}.  \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Constraints}\nThere is a large number of studies reporting limits on the sterile neutrino parameter space based on X-ray data. Examples are \\emph{Chandra} observations of Andromeda \\cite{Watson:2011dw}, \\emph{XMM-Newton} observations of the LMC \\cite{Boyarsky:2006fg} and Willman 1 \\cite{Loewenstein:2012px}, or \\emph{Suzaku} observations of the Perseus cluster and the diffuse background \\cite{Tamura:2014mta,Sekiya:2015jsa}. More detailed summaries of X-ray limits (prior to 2013) can be found in \\cite{Canetti:2012kh,Merle:2013ibc}.\n\nIn this paper we use recent bounds from \\emph{Suzaku} data of the diffuse background \\cite{Sekiya:2015jsa} and the Perseus cluster \\cite{Tamura:2014mta} (thick solid black line in Figs.~\\ref{fig:xmean} and~\\ref{fig:constraints}), the former providing the limit below and the latter above $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim10$ keV. The  \\emph{Suzaku} constraint from the diffuse background is similar in strength to the {\\it Chandra} limits from Andromeda \\cite{Watson:2011dw} and somewhat weaker than recent constraints from \\cite{Horiuchi:2013noa}, \\cite{Riemer-Sorensen:2014yda}, and \\cite{Malyshev:2014xqa} based on observations of Andromeda, the Milky-Way centre, and a collection of nearby dwarf galaxies. We therefore conclude that it is a rather conservative estimate which can be safely adopted as a reference line for this work.\n\nThe {\\it Suzaku} bound from the Perseus cluster, on the other hand, is significantly stronger than former limits at mass scales beyond 10 keV. We therefore provide an additional, more conservative limit at the high-mass end (dashed black line in Figs.~\\ref{fig:xmean} and~\\ref{fig:constraints}) which is based on a compilation of results from Refs.~\\cite{Canetti:2012kh} and \\cite{Ng:2015gfa}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:structform}Structure formation}\nThe sterile neutrino is a non-cold DM candidate and therefore likely to modify structure formation at the smallest observable scales. For this reason it has been put forward as a solution to possible small-scale issues of $\\Lambda$CDM, such as the {\\it missing satellite} \\cite{Bode:2000gq,Dolgov:2000ew,Zavala:2009ms,Reed:2014cta} or the {\\it too-bog-to-fail} problem \\cite{Lovell:2011rd,Anderhalden:2012jc,Schneider:2013wwa}. On the other hand, the reduced small-scale clustering of sterile neutrino DM has been used to constrain the mass of the sterile neutrino. The most stringent constraints come from the the analysis of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest, the characteristic absorption lines from distant quasars. Independent limits are obtained via the abundance of dwarf galaxies in the local neighbourhood. However, most of the constraints published so far refer to warm DM (WDM) with a characteristic power suppression from a thermal-like (Fermi-Dirac) momentum distribution, while sterile neutrinos may have shallower suppressions. In this section we summarise constraints from both Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption and Milky-Way satellite counts, and we show how they can be generalised to more general power suppressions.\n\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:lyal}Constraints from the Lyman-$\\mathbf{\\alpha}$ forest}\nLyman-$\\alpha$ absorption lines probe the distribution of neutral hydrogen along the line-of-sight of luminous, high-redshift quasars.

The flux power spectrum from high-redshift quasars typically spans $k$-ranges of $0.1-2$ h/Mpc,  but much smaller scales (down to the Jeans length of the gas) are probed via the integral of Eq.~\\ref{PS1d} (which formally extends to arbitrarily high $k$-values). This further increases the sensitivity of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest as a probe for small-scale structure formation.\n\nOver the last fifteen years several studies have put forward constraints on non-resonant sterile neutrino DM (or equivalently thermal relic WDM) based on Lyman-$\\alpha$ data. An early study by Ref.~\\cite{Narayanan:2000tp} ruled out thermal relic masses below $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim0.75$ keV. About five years later Refs.~\\cite{Seljak:2006qw,Viel:2006kd} found more stringent constraints of $m_{\\rm WDM}\\gtrsim2.5$ keV based on SDSS data, which allowed to rule out non-resonantly (DW) produced sterile neutrinos as DM candidate.\n\nRecently, Ref.~\\cite{Viel:2013apy} (hereafter V13) used high-redshift quasar spectra from MIKE and HIRES and reported a 2-$\\sigma$ bound of $m_{\\rm WDM}\\gtrsim3.3$ keV on thermal relic WDM (corresponding to a non-resonant sterile neutrino mass of $m_{\\rm sn}\\gtrsim18.5$ keV, see \\cite{Bozek:2015bdo}). This improvement was possible despite comparatively poor statistics (i.e a total of 25 spectra) owing to unprecedented data range in scale and redshift. Even tighter constraints were obtained by Ref.~\\cite{Baur:2015jsy} (hereafter B15), who used more than 13000 quasar spectra from the BOSS survey. B15 found a 2-$\\sigma$ limit of $m_{\\rm WDM}\\gtrsim4.35$ keV (i.e. a non-resonant sterile neutrino mass limit of $m_{\\rm sn}\\gtrsim26.4$ keV\\footnote{B15 quote a limit of $m_{\\rm sn}\\gtrsim31.7$ keV based on the mass conversion from Ref.~\\cite{Viel:2005qj}. Here we give a lower value in agreement with the updated conversion from Ref.~\\cite{Bozek:2015bdo}}) which is the most stringent limit on thermal relic WDM up to date.\n\nWhile DW sterile neutrinos have been ruled out via the combination of Lyman-$\\alpha$ and X-ray data, there are no strong constraints on resonantly produced sterile neutrinos so far. This is mainly due to the nontrivial shape of the power suppression, which requires a detailed investigation of the parameter space. The authors of Ref. \\cite{Boyarsky:2008xj} have derived bounds on a mixed DM scenario (i.e a combination of CDM and thermal relic WDM) arguing that such a model provides a good estimate for resonant sterile neutrino DM. They showed that the spectra of the two scenarios are indeed very similar around the scales where the suppression becomes visible, but they deviate substantially at even smaller scales. The constraints from~\\cite{Boyarsky:2008xj} are therefore expected to be weaker than what can be obtained by directly studying resonant sterile neutrino DM.\n\nIn this section we present a new method to constrain resonant sterile neutrino DM using limits obtained with non-resonant models. While absolute bounds can only be computed with a full statistical analysis (which is beyond the scope of this paper), it is nevertheless possible to determine if a given resonant scenario deviates more or less from the CDM baseline than a non-resonant reference model. If the deviation is consistently larger (over the entire range probed by Lyman-$\\alpha$), then the scenario is excluded at the same confidence level (CL) as the reference model. \n\nFor the non-resonant reference we choose the 2-$\\sigma$ excluded models from V13 and B15 characterised by thermal relic masses of $m_{\\rm WDM}=3.3$ keV and $m_{\\rm WDM}=4.35$ keV, respectively. This allows us to ultimately quote 2-$\\sigma$ limits for the full parameter space of resonantly produced sterile neutrino DM.\n\nWe now give a detailed prescription of the method sketched above: (i) We compute the 3D linear matter power spectra of resonant sterile neutrino DM models (distributed on a grid over the parameter space) using the Boltzmann solver {\\tt CLASS} \\cite{Lesgourgues:2011re,Blas:2011rf,Lesgourgues:2011rh} with {\\it Planck} values for the cosmological parameters \\cite{Planck:2015xua}. There is no need to run simulations, since we are not interested in absolute power spectra but only in the relative hierarchy of different scenarios. (ii) We use Eq.~(\\ref{PS1d}) to calculate 1D power spectra over the entire range probed by the Lyman-$\\alpha$ observations. This depends on the corresponding data and is $0.5 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}\\lesssim k\\lesssim 10 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}$ for the spectra from MIKE+HIRES used in V13 and $0.2 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}\\lesssim k\\lesssim 2 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}$ for the BOSS spectra \\cite{Palanque-Delabrouille:2015pga} used in B15.

(iv) We use the ratio $r(k)$ to determine whether a given resonant scenario is allowed or excluded. This is only possible because the bias factor (defined above Eq.~\\ref{PS1d}) differs very little between CDM and WDM models \\cite{Viel:2005qj}, which means that Eq.~(\\ref{ratio}) describes the ratio of flux power spectra as well. We define a model to be excluded (at 2-$\\sigma$ CL), if the ratio is both below one and monotonically decreasing over the entire range probed by Lyman-$\\alpha$. The two requirements guarantee that the absolute {\\it value} and the {\\it slope} of the given resonant scenario deviates more from the CDM model than the non-resonant reference model.\n\nThe reason why we use both {\\it value} and {\\it slope} of the ratio $r(k)$ as requirements, is that the simulated mean Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux is forced to the observed value for all models in the analysis of V13 and B15. This results in a renormalisation of the 1D power spectrum with slightly more power for WDM with respect to CDM at large scales (see e.g. \\cite{Viel:2013apy} for a more detailed explanation). By considering the {\\it slope} as second requirement, we guarantee to discard models independently of this normalisation.\n\nA similar approach to rule out models with non-trivial power spectra has been developed by the authors of Ref.~\\cite{Palazzo:2007gz}. They used Lyman-$\\alpha$ constraints from non-resonant sterile neutrino DM (obtained by Ref.~\\cite{Seljak:2006qw}) to evaluate the validity of mixed DM scenarios (i.e a mixture of warm and cold DM). Their method consists of defining a pivot scale $k_p=2.0$ h/Mpc  (which corresponds to the smallest scale probed by the Lyman-$\\alpha$ spectra from SDSS) and discarding all scenarios with less 1D power than the reference model (i.e. the 2-$\\sigma$ excluded model from Ref.~\\cite{Seljak:2006qw}) at that pivot scale. This approach is similar but less stringent than our method, as it only considers one scale ($k_p$) and does not include the spectral slope. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:ps} we plot the power spectra of resonant DM models with varying mass and mixing angles. They are the same cases than those presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:dis}. The top panels show ratios of the 3D matter power spectra with respect to the CDM baseline. The reference models of B15 and V13 (corresponding to a thermal relic WDM mass of 4.35 keV and 3.3 keV, respectively) are shown as dashed and dash-dotted grey lines. Based on these plots it is already possible to rule out several scenarios which have less power than the reference models over all scales.

It is well known that in CDM the sub-halo-abundance largely exceeds the number of observed satellites within the Milky-Way. This discrepancy can be quite easily remedied by assuming the right amount of photo-heating during the reionization period to push gas out of small haloes and shut down star formation. As a consequence, in the CDM scenario one expects a large number of unobserved dark subhaloes to orbit within the Milky-Way potential.\n\nDespite rather large uncertainties due to poorly understood baryonic effects, it is nevertheless possible to use observed satellite numbers as a test for non-cold DM scenarios. While there could be many \\emph{more} unobservable sub-haloes orbiting the Milky-Way, it is not possible to have \\emph{less} sub-haloes than satellites observed in the sky. This puts a stringent limit on the coldness of the DM fluid and has been used to constrain thermal relic WDM in the past (see for example~\\cite{Polisensky:2010rw,Kennedy:2013uta,Schneider:2014rda}).\n\nThere are several potential systematic errors that need to be accounted for when using satellites to constrain DM models. First of all, the number of sub-haloes depends on the mass of the Milky-Way \\cite{Kennedy:2013uta}, which is not very well known \\cite{Guo:2009fn}. Furthermore, observed satellites need to be assigned to predicted subhaloes, either by estimating the satellite mass (or circular velocity) \\cite{Polisensky:2010rw} or by modelling star formation and comparing luminosities \\cite{Kennedy:2013uta}. Finally, there is an object-to-object scatter of satellite numbers per host that needs to be taken into account.\n\nIn this paper we follow the approach presented in Ref.~\\cite{Schneider:2014rda} which uses an extended Press-Schechter approach (based on the sharp-$k$ filter, see \\cite{Schneider:2013ria,Benson:2012su,Schneider:2014rda}) to estimate the number of sub-haloes for a given DM scenario. The relation\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 26978, "prevtext": "\nwhere $P(k)$ is the three-dimensional (3D) matter power spectrum. The flux power spectrum from high-redshift quasars typically spans $k$-ranges of $0.1-2$ h/Mpc,  but much smaller scales (down to the Jeans length of the gas) are probed via the integral of Eq.~\\ref{PS1d} (which formally extends to arbitrarily high $k$-values). This further increases the sensitivity of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest as a probe for small-scale structure formation.\n\nOver the last fifteen years several studies have put forward constraints on non-resonant sterile neutrino DM (or equivalently thermal relic WDM) based on Lyman-$\\alpha$ data. An early study by Ref.~\\cite{Narayanan:2000tp} ruled out thermal relic masses below $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim0.75$ keV. About five years later Refs.~\\cite{Seljak:2006qw,Viel:2006kd} found more stringent constraints of $m_{\\rm WDM}\\gtrsim2.5$ keV based on SDSS data, which allowed to rule out non-resonantly (DW) produced sterile neutrinos as DM candidate.\n\nRecently, Ref.~\\cite{Viel:2013apy} (hereafter V13) used high-redshift quasar spectra from MIKE and HIRES and reported a 2-$\\sigma$ bound of $m_{\\rm WDM}\\gtrsim3.3$ keV on thermal relic WDM (corresponding to a non-resonant sterile neutrino mass of $m_{\\rm sn}\\gtrsim18.5$ keV, see \\cite{Bozek:2015bdo}). This improvement was possible despite comparatively poor statistics (i.e a total of 25 spectra) owing to unprecedented data range in scale and redshift. Even tighter constraints were obtained by Ref.~\\cite{Baur:2015jsy} (hereafter B15), who used more than 13000 quasar spectra from the BOSS survey. B15 found a 2-$\\sigma$ limit of $m_{\\rm WDM}\\gtrsim4.35$ keV (i.e. a non-resonant sterile neutrino mass limit of $m_{\\rm sn}\\gtrsim26.4$ keV\\footnote{B15 quote a limit of $m_{\\rm sn}\\gtrsim31.7$ keV based on the mass conversion from Ref.~\\cite{Viel:2005qj}. Here we give a lower value in agreement with the updated conversion from Ref.~\\cite{Bozek:2015bdo}}) which is the most stringent limit on thermal relic WDM up to date.\n\nWhile DW sterile neutrinos have been ruled out via the combination of Lyman-$\\alpha$ and X-ray data, there are no strong constraints on resonantly produced sterile neutrinos so far. This is mainly due to the nontrivial shape of the power suppression, which requires a detailed investigation of the parameter space. The authors of Ref. \\cite{Boyarsky:2008xj} have derived bounds on a mixed DM scenario (i.e a combination of CDM and thermal relic WDM) arguing that such a model provides a good estimate for resonant sterile neutrino DM. They showed that the spectra of the two scenarios are indeed very similar around the scales where the suppression becomes visible, but they deviate substantially at even smaller scales. The constraints from~\\cite{Boyarsky:2008xj} are therefore expected to be weaker than what can be obtained by directly studying resonant sterile neutrino DM.\n\nIn this section we present a new method to constrain resonant sterile neutrino DM using limits obtained with non-resonant models. While absolute bounds can only be computed with a full statistical analysis (which is beyond the scope of this paper), it is nevertheless possible to determine if a given resonant scenario deviates more or less from the CDM baseline than a non-resonant reference model. If the deviation is consistently larger (over the entire range probed by Lyman-$\\alpha$), then the scenario is excluded at the same confidence level (CL) as the reference model. \n\nFor the non-resonant reference we choose the 2-$\\sigma$ excluded models from V13 and B15 characterised by thermal relic masses of $m_{\\rm WDM}=3.3$ keV and $m_{\\rm WDM}=4.35$ keV, respectively. This allows us to ultimately quote 2-$\\sigma$ limits for the full parameter space of resonantly produced sterile neutrino DM.\n\nWe now give a detailed prescription of the method sketched above: (i) We compute the 3D linear matter power spectra of resonant sterile neutrino DM models (distributed on a grid over the parameter space) using the Boltzmann solver {\\tt CLASS} \\cite{Lesgourgues:2011re,Blas:2011rf,Lesgourgues:2011rh} with {\\it Planck} values for the cosmological parameters \\cite{Planck:2015xua}. There is no need to run simulations, since we are not interested in absolute power spectra but only in the relative hierarchy of different scenarios. (ii) We use Eq.~(\\ref{PS1d}) to calculate 1D power spectra over the entire range probed by the Lyman-$\\alpha$ observations. This depends on the corresponding data and is $0.5 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}\\lesssim k\\lesssim 10 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}$ for the spectra from MIKE+HIRES used in V13 and $0.2 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}\\lesssim k\\lesssim 2 \\,{\\rm h/Mpc}$ for the BOSS spectra \\cite{Palanque-Delabrouille:2015pga} used in B15.

(iv) We use the ratio $r(k)$ to determine whether a given resonant scenario is allowed or excluded. This is only possible because the bias factor (defined above Eq.~\\ref{PS1d}) differs very little between CDM and WDM models \\cite{Viel:2005qj}, which means that Eq.~(\\ref{ratio}) describes the ratio of flux power spectra as well. We define a model to be excluded (at 2-$\\sigma$ CL), if the ratio is both below one and monotonically decreasing over the entire range probed by Lyman-$\\alpha$. The two requirements guarantee that the absolute {\\it value} and the {\\it slope} of the given resonant scenario deviates more from the CDM model than the non-resonant reference model.\n\nThe reason why we use both {\\it value} and {\\it slope} of the ratio $r(k)$ as requirements, is that the simulated mean Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux is forced to the observed value for all models in the analysis of V13 and B15. This results in a renormalisation of the 1D power spectrum with slightly more power for WDM with respect to CDM at large scales (see e.g. \\cite{Viel:2013apy} for a more detailed explanation). By considering the {\\it slope} as second requirement, we guarantee to discard models independently of this normalisation.\n\nA similar approach to rule out models with non-trivial power spectra has been developed by the authors of Ref.~\\cite{Palazzo:2007gz}. They used Lyman-$\\alpha$ constraints from non-resonant sterile neutrino DM (obtained by Ref.~\\cite{Seljak:2006qw}) to evaluate the validity of mixed DM scenarios (i.e a mixture of warm and cold DM). Their method consists of defining a pivot scale $k_p=2.0$ h/Mpc  (which corresponds to the smallest scale probed by the Lyman-$\\alpha$ spectra from SDSS) and discarding all scenarios with less 1D power than the reference model (i.e. the 2-$\\sigma$ excluded model from Ref.~\\cite{Seljak:2006qw}) at that pivot scale. This approach is similar but less stringent than our method, as it only considers one scale ($k_p$) and does not include the spectral slope. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:ps} we plot the power spectra of resonant DM models with varying mass and mixing angles. They are the same cases than those presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:dis}. The top panels show ratios of the 3D matter power spectra with respect to the CDM baseline. The reference models of B15 and V13 (corresponding to a thermal relic WDM mass of 4.35 keV and 3.3 keV, respectively) are shown as dashed and dash-dotted grey lines. Based on these plots it is already possible to rule out several scenarios which have less power than the reference models over all scales. However, there are many scenarios with less power at smaller and more power at larger $k$-values, owing to the fact that resonant production tends to yield shallower power suppressions. These cases require the more thorough analysis described above.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\\center{\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec_ms7.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec_ms10.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec_ms15.pdf}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec1d_ms7_B15.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec1d_ms10_B15.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec1d_ms15_B15.pdf}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec1d_ms7_V13.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec1d_ms10_V13.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=.325\\textwidth,trim={1.2cm 1.1cm 3.4cm 0cm}]{Figs/spec1d_ms15_V13.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:ps}Relative power spectra of the resonant models from Fig.~\\ref{fig:dis} (same colour scheme). {\\it Top}: 3D matter power spectra with respect to the CDM baseline.

We now apply these methods to the entire sterile neutrino parameter space in order to see which parts can be ruled out with available data.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:constraints} we plot the parameter space in terms of mixing angle and mass (same as Fig.~\\ref{fig:xmean}). Limits from X-ray observations by {\\it Suzaku} are included as a thick black solid line (with grey shaded area). A more conservative limit based on Refs.~\\cite{Canetti:2012kh,Ng:2015gfa} is added as a dashed line. The red point with error bar refers to the sterile neutrino interpretation of the suggested X-ray line signal~\\cite{Bulbul:2014sua,Boyarsky:2014jta}.\n\nThe limit from Milky-Way satellite counts is illustrated as brown coloured area in Fig.~\\ref{fig:constraints}. It excludes all models with particle mass below $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim 5$ keV and large parts of the parameter space above. The region around the claimed line signal is still allowed by satellite counts (as already shown by Refs.~\\cite{Abazajian:2014gza, Merle:2014xpa, Lovell:2015psz}). Intriguingly, sterile neutrino DM with $m_{\\rm sn}=7.1$ keV and a mixing angle of $\\sin^2(2\\theta)\\sim 2-20\\times 10^{-11}$ also seems to alleviate both the {\\it missing satellite} and the {\\it too-big-to-fail} problems \\cite{Abazajian:2014gza,Bozek:2015bdo,Horiuchi:2015qri}.\n\nThe generalised Lyman-$\\alpha$ limit based on the V13 reference model (excluding thermal relic WDM with $m_{\\rm WDM}\\lesssim3.3$ keV) is given by the green area in Fig.~\\ref{fig:constraints}. It is considerably stronger than the bound from Milky-Way satellites and disfavours large parts of the remaining parameter space. Only a relatively small area above $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim 12$ keV remains unchallenged by the bounds based on V13. Furthermore, the line signal at $m_{\\rm sn}=7.1$ keV is in clear conflict with these limits (as pointed out in Ref.~\\cite{Merle:2014xpa}) putting further pressure on the sterile neutrino DM interpretation of the X-ray excess.\n\n\nThe generalised Lyman-$\\alpha$ constraint based on the B15 reference model (excluding thermal relic WDM with $m_{\\rm WDM}\\lesssim4.35$ keV) is illustrated by the yellow area in Fig.~\\ref{fig:constraints}. \nIt completely overlaps with the {\\it Suzaku} X-ray limits and therefore excludes the entire parameter space of resonantly produced sterile neutrino DM. Furthermore, the limit strongly disfavours the sterile neutrino interpretation of the the suggested X-ray line signal.\n\nIn summary, the bounds presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:constraints} show for the first time that it is possible to not only rule out the non-resonant sterile neutrino scenario with structure formation, but to put strong pressure on the resonant production mechanism. However, before drawing final conclusions, it is important to note that both the X-ray and the Lyman-$\\alpha$ limits might be subject to systematics which could somewhat reduce these limits. For example, the authors of Ref.~\\cite{Garzilli:2015iwa} point out that the Lyman-$\\alpha$ bounds of V13 could be relaxed to $m_{\\rm sn}\\simeq 2.1$ keV, provided no specific temperature evolution of the intergalactic medium is assumed. This would shrink the green area to a size comparable to the brown area from satellite counts. On the other hand, B15 stress in their paper that the arguments of Ref.~\\cite{Garzilli:2015iwa} do not affect their limits on the sterile neutrino particle mass (i.e the yellow area would not be reduced). The analysis of B15 could, however, suffer from systematics affecting the highest redshift bins of the BOSS data. B15 showed that ignoring these bins in their analysis significantly reduces the limit to $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim 3.1$ keV (which would shrink the yellow area roughly down to the green one).\n\nThe X-ray bounds should also be interpreted with care as they depend on difficult flux measurements. While there are several independent observations leading to similar (or even stronger) limits at masses below 10 keV, the {\\it Suzaku} observations yield peerlessly tight bounds above this mass scale. For this reason, we also show independent X-ray bounds from \\cite{Canetti:2012kh,Ng:2015gfa}, which still allow for resonant sterile neutrino DM with mass in the range of $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim17-27$ keV and mixing angles below $\\sin^2(2\\theta)\\sim5\\times 10^{-12}$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:conclusions}Conclusions}\nThe hypothetical sterile neutrino is an attractive dark matter (DM) candidate which only requires a minimal extension to the standard model of particle physics. As sterile neutrinos are not weakly interacting, they cannot be produced in the standard way by thermal freeze-out from the primordial plasma. The most popular production mechanism is by \\emph{freeze-in} via resonantly enhanced mixing with the active neutrinos (i.e., the so-called Shi-Fuller mechanism).\n\nSterile neutrino DM consists of a testable scenario, expected to cause a line-signal in X-ray spectra (due to a decay channel to photons and active neutrinos) and to suppress structure formation at the smallest observable scales (due to significant free-streaming). These characteristics lead to independent constraints which have been used previously to rule out sterile neutrino DM based on non-resonant (Dodelson-Widrow) production \\cite{Seljak:2006qw,Viel:2006kd,Horiuchi:2013noa}. The case of resonant production is more challenging because it yields non-standard momentum distributions affecting the details of small-scale clustering.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to constrain resonantly produced sterile neutrino DM with structure formation. We develop a method to generalise existing Lyman-$\\alpha$ limits from thermal relic warm DM to the resonant sterile neutrino scenario. The method allows to exclude all resonant models which deviate more from the CDM baseline (at every data point of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux power spectrum) than a previously excluded non-resonant reference model. Based on two reference models from Ref.~\\cite{Baur:2015jsy} and \\cite{Viel:2013apy} (referred to as B15 and V13, respectively), we are able to derive unprecedented bounds on the resonant scenario. Combined with the tightest bounds from X-ray observations, the former excludes the entire parameter space of resonant sterile neutrino DM at the 2-$\\sigma$ confidence level, while the latter still leaves some room for sterile neutrinos with particle mass  above $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim 12$ keV and mixing angles below $\\sin^22\\theta\\sim 10^{-11}$.\n\n\n\nIn a next step we apply a method developed in Ref.~\\cite{Schneider:2014rda} to constrain the resonant scenario with Milky-Way satellite counts. We obtain less stringent limits than the ones from Lyman-$\\alpha$, excluding all scenarios with particle mass below $m_{\\rm sn}\\sim 5$ keV.\n\nRegarding the suggested X-ray line signal at $3.55$ keV \\cite{Bulbul:2014sua,Boyarsky:2014jta}, we find the sterile neutrino interpretation to be clearly disfavoured by the limits from Lyman-$\\alpha$ (based on both reference models) but consistent with the ones from Milky-Way satellite counts. This is in agreement with previous work from Ref.~\\cite{Merle:2014xpa} and \\cite{Horiuchi:2015qri,Lovell:2015psz}.\n\nIn summary, our findings show that sterile neutrino DM from resonant production is disfavoured by the combined limits from Lyman-$\\alpha$ and X-ray data. However, we want to stress that both limits might be susceptible to systematics which need to be fully understood before drawing final conclusions.\n \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nI want to thank A.
