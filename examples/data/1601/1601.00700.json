Thus, direct measurements of monolayer dynamics near melting, which\nare very scarce in the family of nominally two-dimensional systems, may be\nfeasible in this case.\n\nThe corrugation for Xe/Pt is much larger than it is for xenon on the basal\nplane of graphite (Xe/Gr).\\cite{BarRet92,*BarRet94,BruNov00,BruNov08,NovBru14}\nThe Xe/Pt minimum barrier to translation from one adsorption site to the\nnext is roughly $275$~K, whereas the minimum in the effective\ninteraction between two Xe atoms is about $238$~K\n(for Xe/Gr, the barrier is about $50$~K.).\nThis should produce strong competition between atom-atom forces and\natom-substrate forces.\nHowever, there is a report\\cite{PoeVerCom85} that the Xe/Pt triple\npoint temperature is $98\\pm2$~K, essentially equal to that of\nXe/Gr,\\cite{BruDieVen07,NovBru14} a surface with a smaller\ncorrugation\\cite{BruNov00,BruNov08} by a factor of about $5$ or $6$.\nWhile it is expected that thermal excitations will somewhat smooth\nthe effects of substrate corrugation,\\cite{BruNov00} and this\nindeed is the case with Xe/Gr,\\cite{BruNov08,NovBru14} results of\npreliminary molecular-dynamics calculations\\cite{Note-Stud} for Xe/Pt\nindicate there is insufficient smoothing\nto explain such similar triple point temperatures. The\nresults of those preliminary calculations suggest\nthere should be a measurable effect upon the triple point of Xe/Pt\nas a result of this corrugation.\nDilemma: Why should a system with such strong corrugation behave\nso like a system with rather weak corrugation?\\cite{NovBru14}\n\nThe strong corrugation of the Xe/Pt system and the fact that the monolayer\napparently melts from the commensurate solid phase\\cite{PoeVerCom85} suggests\nan interesting possibility: the existence of an incipient triple point.\nThis can occur\nif the substrate corrugation is strong enough to sufficiently lower the\nfree energy of the solid phase so as to maintain a direct\ntransition from the solid phase into the gas phase, bypassing the\nliquid phase altogether.\\cite{Nis86,NisGri85}\nWith Xe/Pt, we not only have strong corrugation,\nbut also a dilated Xe lattice which weakens the\neffects of the attractive region of the Xe-Xe interaction.  This dilation\nis due to the $\\sqrt{3}\\!\\times\\!\\sqrt{3}$-R$30^{\\circ}$ phase\n({$\\sqrt{{3}}$} phase) having a lattice spacing\\cite{KerDavZep88} of\n$4.80$~\\AA, which is significantly\nlarger than the ``natural'' lattice spacing of the Xe,\nthat being in the $4.38$--$4.55$~\\AA\\ range.\\cite{NovBru14} \nThis implies Xe atoms, when they are located on\nthe {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} adsorption sites, tend to be kept away from the hard-core\nregion of their mutual interaction and found in the weaker region\nof their attractive well.  Therefore, there exists the possibility that\nthis system will, at high temperatures, act much like a lattice gas on\na triangular lattice (here, exhibiting repulsive nearest neighbors and\nattractive next-nearest neighbor interactions). This is an interesting\npossibility since transitions in similar systems have been examined\ntheoretically,\\cite{SchSid73} including renormalization group\ncalculations.\\cite{SchWalWor77,SchWalWor77a}\nThe results reported in this communication are part of a much larger\nstudy\\cite{Note-NovBav} of the structure and thermodynamics of Xe/Pt.\nThe results reported here for Xe/Gr build upon the analysis\nreported in Ref.~{\\onlinecite{NovBru14}}.\n\nThe simulation model for Xe/Pt is the Xe/Gr model\\cite{NovBru14}\nadapted to Xe/Pt with new parameters for the substrate-mediated\ninteraction and a much larger potential\nenergy corrugation.\\cite{BruNov00,BruGraToe00}\nValidation of the resulting model for Xe/Pt is mainly based on\nthe analysis\\cite{BruGraToe00} of the stability and dynamics of a\ncompressed triangular lattice of Xe/Pt with nearest neighbor\nspacing $4.33$~\\AA.\nThe Barker-Rettner (BR) model\\cite{BarRet92,*BarRet94} is used for the\n3D potential energy surface of Xe/Pt as in Ref.~\\onlinecite{BruNov00}.\nIn this work, the BR interaction is simplified by first using a 2D version\nof the 3D Steele expansion,\\cite{Ste74} and then truncating the\nsum in reciprocal space (consistent with the substrate's $6$-fold symmetry).\nThus\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{SteeleEq}\nU(\\bm{r}) = U_{(1,0)} \\sum_{\\bm{G}} \\exp ( i \\bm{G} \\cdot \\bm{r} ) ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"U(\\bm{r})=U_{(1,0)}\\sum_{\\bm{G}}\\exp(i\\bm{G}\\cdot\\bm{r}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>U</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc93</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>U</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>\ud835\udc6e</mi></munder><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\ud835\udc6e</mi></mrow><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>\ud835\udc93</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00700.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $N$ is the number of Xe atoms and $\\bm{\\tau}_{(1,0)}$ is a primitive\nreciprocal lattice vector for the Xe {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} structure.\nThis order parameter is, of course, nothing more than\nthe basic structure factor evaluated at $\\bm{\\tau}_{(1,0)}$\nand is a sensitive test of the lattice gas ordering in the {$\\sqrt{{3}}$}\ncommensurate lattice.

The constrained geometries are also used to test\nthe sensitivity of the simulations to system size and to follow the\nsystem in a simpler context (having only one phase present at any given\ntemperature).  However, the transition\ntemperature for the constrained geometries is quite high, and\nnot relevant to the experimental conditions. In fact, it would be expected\nthat layer promotion would become quite important well before the transition\nwould be reached for these constrained geometries.\nSimulations of the unconstrained geometries are used to examine\nboth the thermal behavior and the structural properties of the submonolayer\npatch. These configurations  generally show 2-phase coexistence of a 2D gas and\na 2D dense phase (most cases follow the 2D sublimation curve).\n\nThe 2D projection (at very low temperatures) of the BR model for\nXe/Pt gives\\cite{Note-U_G}\n$ -36$~K $\\le U_{(1,0)} \\le -34$~K.  This is obtained by assigning\nthe BR energy barrier to the corrugation given by\nEq.~(\\ref{SteeleEq}).  For Xe/Pt, this corrugation produces a {$\\sqrt{{3}}$}\nstructure for the ground state.  However, simulations carried out for\nsmaller corrugations test both the stability of the {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} ground state\nto variations in the corrugation and address the issue of the effective\ncorrugation being dependent on temperature due to the thermal motion of the Xe\nin the direction normal to the surface.\\cite{SeyCarDie99,BruNov00,Note-NovBav}\nThermal vibration of the adatom normal to the surface causes the effective\ncorrugation to decrease as the temperatures\nincreases.\\cite{BruNov00,Note-NovBav}\nAlthough we have examined a number of corrugation values,\nwe report only those listed in\nTable~\\ref{Table:CaseStudies}.  While the HIC structure is the ground state\nfor the smaller corrugation, both high and low corrugation cases for the\nunconstrained geometries exhibit a stable {$\\sqrt{{3}}$}\nstructure below melting. This behavior is independent of the\ndifferent initialization structures ({$\\sqrt{{3}}$} or HIC)\ngenerated for the system. However, for the U15H case the transition from\nHIC to {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} occurs just below melting.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{Figure_1.eps}\n   \\caption{\\label{OrderDisorderPlots-1}(Color online) The hexatic\n    order parameter, the NDP order parameter, and the specific heat\n    for case study U36-64K of Xe/Pt, showing the alignment of\n    the peak in the specific heat with the sharp drop in value of $\\psi_0$.\n    The density is $\\rho_p$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nExamination of the heating data for case study U36-64K shows a distinct\ntransition from an ordered to a disordered state at about $230$~K.\nFigure~\\ref{OrderDisorderPlots-1} shows the specific heat and the magnitudes\nof the order parameters $\\psi_0$ and $\\psi_6$.

The specific heat peak is aligned very nicely with the sharp\ndecrease in $\\psi_0$ and suggests that $\\psi_0$ is a good\nmeasure of this order-disorder transition.  Furthermore, the specific heat\nis more suggestive of a classic continuous transition than of the\ntraditional discontinuous transition of a triple point constrained by a fixed\narea (which would have a trapezoidal profile).  It is relevant here\nto be mindful that the natural spacing of the Xe atoms is smaller than the\nspacing in the {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} structure. Thus the usual situation of a triple point\nbeing associated with an increase in area is not relevant and the\nstructure seems to be dominated by the corrugation of the substrate even at\nthe (incipient) triple point.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{Figure_2.eps}\n   \\caption{\\label{SpHeat.vs.Temp-Xe.Gr}(Color online) The hexatic\n    order parameter and the specific heat\n    for case study U6H-78K of Xe/Gr, comparing methods for the\n    calculation of the specific heat.\n    The average density is about $\\rho_g/2$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe results for Xe/Pt are different from those obtained for Xe/Gr, where\nthere is clear evidence, within statistical uncertainty, of a vertical rise\nin the energy at a fixed temperature.\\cite{NovBru14} This results in\na specific heat that has a sharp (almost vertical) rise in the specific\nheat and a much smaller precursor to this sharp rise as seen\nin Fig.~\\ref{SpHeat.vs.Temp-Xe.Gr}, where the hexatic order parameter\nshows a sharp drop in its value. This drop is well aligned with\nthe vertical rise in the total energy, implying that $\\psi_6$ is a\ngood measure of the order-disorder in the Xe/Gr system.\\cite{NovBru14}\n\nAll these behaviors are consistent with structure factor plots of\neach system showing a clear loss of order as the system moves through the\ncorresponding transition.\\cite{NovBru14,Note-NovBav}\nHowever, for Xe/Pt, there is no clear indication\nof a self-bound liquid state in the spatial plots of the system as there\nis\\cite{BruNov08,NovBru14} for Xe/Gr.\nFigure~\\ref{DensityProfiles} shows a distinct liquid-gas interface for Xe/Gr\njust above its triple point, but no hint of such an\ninterface for Xe/Pt just above its order-disorder\ntransition. In both cases, these plots are for initially\nhexagonal patches centered in the simulation cell.\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{Figure_3.eps}\n   \\caption{\\label{DensityProfiles}(Color online) Comparison of\n    the density profiles for patches of Xe/Gr\n    (case study U6H-78K; $T_m \\simeq 100$~K;\n         $ \\rho \\simeq \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_g $) and Xe/Pt\n    (case study U36H-20K; $T_m \\simeq 150$~K;\n    $ \\rho \\simeq \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_p $)\n    just above the melting (order-disorder) transition.}\n\\end{figure}\nFor Xe/Pt, there is no evidence of a discontinuous transition; rather there\nis evidence of a likely continuous one. For the unconstrained geometries,\nthere tends to be more scatter in the data, and both order parameters drop\nmore gradually to zero (as compared to the constrained geometries).\nFor U36H-20K, the transition temperature is $\\simeq 150$~K,\nsignificantly lower than that for U36-64K, but still significantly\nhigher than the experimental value\\cite{PoeVerCom85}\nof $\\simeq 100$~K.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{Figure_4.eps}\n   \\caption{\\label{OrderDisorderPlots-2}(Color online) The hexatic\n    order parameter, the NDP order parameter, and the specific heat\n    for case study U15H-20K of Xe/Pt, showing the\n    alignment of the peak in the specific heat with the\n    sharp drop in value of $\\psi_0$.\n    The average density is about $\\rho_p/2$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt temperatures near the transition temperature, the corrugation\nis smoothed by the thermal motion perpendicular to the surface (lateral\nmotion smoothing is part of the MD simulation). Preliminary\nestimates of smoothing\\cite{Note-NovBav} at these high temperatures\nresult in $|U_{(1,0)}|$\nvalues in the $20$--$25$~K range, corrugations which still\nproduce order-disorder\ntemperatures higher than the experimental value. Question: How large\nmust the smoothing be to bring the simulation results closer to the\nexperimental temperature?  In Fig.~\\ref{OrderDisorderPlots-2}, the effects of\nextreme smoothing are shown using a $U_{(1,0)}$ of $-15$~K. The transition\ntemperature is about $120$~K, significantly lower than that of the\nU36H-20K case study.\n\nThe $\\psi_0$ order parameter appears to be a better measure than\n$\\psi_6$ for the order-disorder\nassociated with the transition from solid to fluid in the Xe/Pt system.\nThe drop in the order parameter with increasing temperature near the\ntransition is steeper and more complete for $\\psi_0$ than it is for $\\psi_6$.\nFurthermore, $\\psi_0$ is more sensitive than is $\\psi_6$ to system\nsize,\\cite{Note-NovBav}\nand this is what would be expected if $\\psi_0$ is the more thermodynamically\nrelevant order parameter.  This is in stark contrast to the results for\nXe/Gr,\\cite{NovBru14} where $\\psi_6$ is a very good measure of\nthe order-disorder near the triple point of that system as shown in\nFig.~\\ref{SpHeat.vs.Temp-Xe.Gr}.\n\nThe melting of Xe/Pt is clearly of a different nature than\nthe true triple point melting of Xe/Gr.  This can be seen by the differences\nin the specific heats, order parameters, and structural orderings\nof the two systems. These calculations and other observations of the\nsolid\\cite{SeyCarDie99,Thesis-Ward} above $100$~K make it\nlikely the phenomenon at $98$~K in Ref.~\\onlinecite{PoeVerCom85} is\nnot triple point melting.  These simulations\nsuggest that a Xe/Pt triple point at $\\simeq 100$~K is inconsistent with\nthe observation of a {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} phase at $60$~K.\nThe case of Xe/Pt has all the earmarks of an incipient\ntriple point as described in Ref.~\\onlinecite{Nis86}, having a specific\nheat that looks much like that of a lattice gas transition as described in\nRef.~\\onlinecite{SchWalWor77a}. Since there are finite-size effects (as there\nare in any simulation), it is not possible to rule out a normal triple point\nand a normal critical point separated by a small temperature gap.  However,\nsuch effects would also bedevil the experimental systems. Studies on larger\nsystems having longer run times would be welcome, as well as a better\nunderstanding of the thermal smoothing of the corrugation. More thorough\nexperimental studies of the dense monolayer at $100$--$125$~K (such as\nmeasurements of diffusive motions) might be decisive in establishing the\nway in which the monolayer disorders.\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nWe would like to acknowledge and thank C.

As in those works, we examined both\nconstrained geometries (a single phase filling the simulations box) and\nunconstrained geometries (an isolated patch surrounded by vapor).\nThe density of the {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} structure is denoted\nby $\\rho_{p}$ for Xe/Pt and by $\\rho_{g}$ for Xe/Gr. Simulations for the\nunconstrained geometries are for average densities $\\rho$ that are roughly\nhalf that of the corresponding {$\\sqrt{{3}}$} phase.\nIn addition to the thermodynamic quantities calculated in\nRef.~\\onlinecite{NovBru14} (such as the hexatic order parameter $\\psi_6$),\ncalculations are carried out for the specific heat at constant area\n$c_a$ and a\nsecond order parameter: the ``Net-Domain-Phase'' (NDP) order parameter.\nThe set of case studies reported here are detailed in\nTable~\\ref{Table:CaseStudies}.\n\nCalculations for $c_a$ use the\nfluctuations in the kinetic energy of the system.\\cite{LebPerVer67}\nAs a consequence of this approach, there are some problems in evaluating\n$c_a$ when the drift in the energy is too large\nover the averaging time interval, as this can result in negative values\nfor $c_a$. Nevertheless, most of the calculations result in values\nthat are consistent with the slope of the total energy versus temperature\ndata.\\cite{Note-Deriv} However, the latter approach also generates some\nvalues which are negative (resulting from statistical uncertainty in the\nthermodynamic quantities).  Negative values for $c_a$ (as well as\nsome very large positive values) are not included in the plots.\n\nThe NDP order parameter is important in determining and understanding the\nnature of the order-disorder transition in Xe/Pt.
