The study of high energy nuclear collisions\nhas entered a new era where current physics programs at both RHIC and LHC focus on the properties of the new form\nof matter and how the hot matter undergoes the deconfinement transition. Since the new state of matter can exist only in the early stage of the collisions and cannot be directly observed in the final state, one needs sensitive probes to demonstrate the formation of the new state. Heavy flavor hadrons, including open and hidden charm or beauty hadrons, are widely considered as such probes. Different from light hadrons which are constructed from the constituents of the hot matter on the phase transition hypersurface and carry the collective properties of the matter, heavy quarks are mainly produced through hard processes in the initial\nstage of the collisions, due to their large masses compared to the scale of QCD and the temperature of the medium. Then the initially produced quarkonia and the rest of the heavy quarks will pass through the whole medium and carry its properties in the final state.\nBy comparing the open charm production in A+A collisions with that in elementary p+p collisions, we can extract\ninformation about the energy loss of heavy quarks\nduring their propagation through the hot medium. On the other hand, due to\ncolor screening at finite temperature and density, quarkonium suppression in nuclear collisions has\nbeen proposed to provide an unambiguous signature of QGP formation.\n\n\n\\section{Heavy Quark Transport}\n\\label{s2}\n\nIn high energy nuclear collisions, heavy quarks are investigated through measuring the decay products of open heavy mesons, like pions and kaons, or semi-leptonic\ndecay electrons and muons, or reconstructed non-prompt charmonia from $B$ decay. Due to the large mass, one would intuitively expect that, heavy quarks can hardly participate the medium collective motion and their thermalization should be difficult in comparison with light quarks. However, at both RHIC and LHC heavy quarks follow availably the flow\nof the medium and possess a large elliptic flow $v_2$. This discovery indicates an extremely strong interaction between heavy quarks and the hot and dense medium, especially near the hadronization time when the collective flow of the bulk medium has already built up.\nAt the moment, what is the exact mechanism of the in-medium interaction of heavy quarks is still an open question and extensively studied\nin both perturbative and nonperturbative approaches. For very hard heavy quarks with $p_T\\gg m_Q$, the medium induced gluon radiation is expected to dominate the energy loss mechanism, since there should be no big difference between\nheavy and light quarks in ultra-relativistic domain where quark mass is negligible. Due to the dead cone effect induced by the large\nmass scale at small or intermediate $p_T$ range, the radiative process is reduced and the collisional energy loss\nis invoked.\n\nIn the hot QCD medium, the typical momentum transfer in heavy quark interactions is of the order of the Debye mass $m_D\\sim gT$. At the\ncurrent colliding energies, it is smaller than the heavy quark mass (strictly speaking, the thermal momentum), a Fokker-Planck approach\nor Langevin approach is then suitable to treat the Brown motion of heavy quarks in medium, which can be deduced from the corresponding Boltzmann\nequation without mean field interaction, see for instance Ref.~\\cite{svetitsky} for details. In such stochastic treatment, the heavy quark in-medium interaction and the medium properties are encoded in the equation through the transport coefficients. In the Langevin approach, the three-momentum of an individual heavy quark evolves as\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n \\frac{d{\\bf p}}{dt}=-\\gamma(T,p){\\bf p}+{\\bf \\eta}(t),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{d{\\bf p}}{dt}=-\\gamma(T,p){\\bf p}+{\\bf\\eta}(t),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\ud835\udc29</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\ud835\udc29</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b7</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00278.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith ${\\bf \\mathnormal{f}_g}=-d{\\bf p}_g/dt$, and the momentum of radiated gluons are sampled according to the gluon radiation spectrum\nevaluated from pQCD higher twist calculation.

In the case of weak coupling, the momentum\ndiffusion can be calculated in the frame of perturbative QCD at different levels, for instance at the leading order~\\cite{svetitsky}, leading order with hard thermal loop resummation~\\cite{moore,alberico}, next to leading order~\\cite{huot}, and leading order with hard thermal loop resummation and running coupling~\\cite{peigne,gossiaux,uphoff}.

To describe simultaneously the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ of open heavy mesons,\nthe drag coefficient in the Langevin approach needs to have a strong enhancement around the critical temperature $T_c$.

The enhancement around $T_c$ for $\\hat q/T^3$ and dropping off for $\\eta/s$ are mainly due to the emergence of color-magnetic monopoles near $T_c$\nwhich are the pertinent degrees of freedom with\nlong wavelength probably assuring the confinement transition. However, only the high $p_T$ heavy flavors can be described in\nthis framework. For the low $p_T$ part, the coalescence mechanism for a heavy quark to statistically pick up a light quark on the hadronization hyper surface can also contribute to the large\ncollective flow.\n\nFrom the lattice QCD simulation~\\cite{kaczmarek3}, there is a very large additional entropy around $T_c$ associated with\na heavy quark pair and it increases with the heavy quark distance in some range, reflecting an entanglement\nbetween the heavy quark and the medium which induces numerous states for the heavy quark pair. Focusing on heavy quarks\n(or considering long distance limit for heavy quark pairs), this indicates that, heavy quarks are strongly\ncoupled to the medium, especially near $T_c$.

The Cornell potential describes well the quarkonium spectroscopy in vacuum and thus provides a well-defined background to further test the medium effects at finite temperature and density. From the microscopic QCD theory itself, the Cornell potential can be understood\nusing the effective field theories NRQCD and pNRQCD in $1/m_Q$ expansion~\\cite{barchielli}, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. When we put the heavy quark pair into a\nQGP phase, the color screening will limit the range of the attractive binding force between the two quarks. When the screening radius $r_D$, which is inversely proportional to the temperature of the QGP, becomes smaller than the bound state radius, the pair will melt into the medium~\\cite{matsui}. This inspires the sequential melting scenario that the quarkonium states with different binding energy have different melting temperature and disappear in the hot medium sequentially.

Inversely, this provides\na way to extract the microscopic dissociation cross section from the dissociation rate~\\cite{brambilla,escobedo,brambilla2}.\n\nAnother hot medium effect related to the quarkonium suppression is the quarkonium regeneration inside the hot medium~\\cite{pbm,thews,rapp,yan} through the recombination of those uncorrelated heavy quarks. With increasing colliding energy, the suppression of the initially produced quarkonia becomes more and more strong, but the regeneration contribution increases due to the abundant heavy quarks in the medium at high energies. The balance between the suppression and the regeneration controls the quarkonium production in high energy nuclear collisions. There are different ways to treat the suppression and regeneration. Within the statistical\nhadronization model~\\cite{pbm}, the quarkonia are statistically produced at the\nhadronization transition from kinetically equilibrated medium, and all the initially produced quarkonia are assumed to be absorbed by the medium. Considering the fact that\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ can survive in the medium with temperature above the critical temperature $T_c$ and below the dissociation temperature $T_{J/\\psi} (T_\\Upsilon$), a continuous regeneration\nscheme is proposed in kinetic formalism~\\cite{thews} where quarkonia can be both dissociated\nand regenerated continuously inside the QGP medium. In a strongly coupled QGP phase, the charm quark diffusion constant is very small, and the binding force between the two quarks inside a charmonium is still strong~\\cite{shuryak}, especially near $T_c$,  a generalized Langevin approach with additional binding force (${\\bf F}=-\\nabla V$) is proposed\nto evaluate the charmonium evolution, where the regeneration from correlated charm quarks is included.\nMore generally, being motivated by the fact that the QGP produced in heavy ion collisions is a rapid cooling system, open quantum\nsystem formalisms are developed for studying quarkonia in nuclear collisions~\\cite{akamatsu} which exclude the adiabatic condition used in usual treatments.\nSimilar to the open quantum system approaches, a Hamiltonian based\napproach is developed, and through a chain of well-controlled approximations it finally arrives at a generalized\nLangevin formalism, with which both the quarkonium dissociation and regeneration are calculable~\\cite{blaizot}.\n\n\n\\section{Quarkonium Transverse Momentum Distribution}\n\\label{s5}\n\nTransverse motion is developed during the dynamical evolution of\nthe system.

The loss and gain terms on the right hand side of the transport equation are controlled by the quarkonium suppression and generation~\\cite{liu3,tang}. Fig.\\ref{fig1} shows the calculated $J/\\psi$ $r_{AA}$~\\cite{zhou2} as a function of collision\ncentrality ($N_{part}$) for collisions at SPS, RHIC and\nLHC. There is a clear rise in\n$r_{AA}$ in peripheral collisions at all colliding energies. It\nis believed due to the Cronin effect before\nthe quarkonium formation~\\cite{cronin} and it is more\nimportant for collisions at lower energy.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth]{fig1.eps}\n\\caption{(color online)  $J/\\psi\\ r_{AA}=\\langle p_t^2\\rangle_{AA}/\\langle\np_t^2\\rangle_{pp}$ as a function of collision centrality ($N_{part}$)\nfor collisions at SPS (open triangles)\\cite{spsptraa}, RHIC (open\ncircles)\\cite{rhic2007} and LHC (filled circles)\\cite{aliceptraa}.\nLeft and right plot are results from mid-rapidity and\nforward-rapidity, respectively.  The solid and dashed lines indicate\nthe model results with and without considering the shadowing\neffect~\\cite{eks}. }\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{center}\n\n\nThe centrality dependence of $r_{AA}$ clearly reflects the\nunderlying $J/\\psi$ production and suppression mechanisms in high\nenergy nuclear collisions. At lower collision energy where the charm\ncross section is small and the regeneration is negligible, almost\nall of the observed $J/\\psi$s are produced at the initial impact. In\nthis case, the Cronin\neffect~\\cite{cronin} is dominant and tends to increase the\ntransverse momenta of the finally observed quarkonia. As a result\n$r_{AA}$ is always above unity and increases monotonically versus\ncollision centrality, see left panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig1}. In the\ntruly high energy heavy ion collisions, on the other hand, charm\nquarks are copiously produced and the regeneration for quarkonia can be significant. Although these heavy quarks\nare initially produced via hard process with large transverse\nmomenta, they loss energy when interacting with the medium.\nSince the temperature is high in such violent collisions,\nespecially in the most central collisions, almost all initially\nproduced $J/\\psi$s are destroyed and the regenerated $J/\\psi$s\ndominate the final production. As shown in the left panel of\nFig.\\ref{fig1}, the predicted $r_{AA}$ for heavy ion collisions at\nLHC is less than unity and decreases toward more central collisions.\nThe prediction has been confirmed by the experimental results at\nsomewhat forward rapidity window as shown in the right plot of\nFig.\\ref{fig1}~\\cite{aliceptraa}. The strong competition between the\ninitial parton scattering and the regeneration at RHIC energy leads\nto a flat centrality dependence of $r_{AA}$ at mid-rapidity,\nshown as open circles in the left plot. Shift a bit away from the\nmid rapidity, see the right plot of Fig.\\ref{fig1}, the ratio at\nRHIC is increasing versus centrality signaling the importance of\ninitial scattering at the RHIC energy. One may ask oneself if the\nabove result of $r_{AA}$ is due to the initial shadowing effect\nwhich changes the parton distributions in nuclei. Different from the integrated\nyield, the averaged transverse momentum is a normalized quantity,\ntherefore the shadowing induced change in the parton\ndistribution is minimized. As shown in Fig.\\ref{fig1},  the small difference between the\nsolid and dashed lines, the hatched band, is the results of shadowing effect~\\cite{eks}.\n\nThe elliptic flow is a measure of the collective motion and sensitive to the thermalization of the quarkonia. It describes the asymmetry of the quarkonium transverse motion,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n v_2=\\langle \\frac{p^2_x-p^2_y}{p^2_x+p^2_y}\\rangle = \\langle \\cos 2\\phi \\rangle.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe initially produced $J/\\psi$s only\npossess a very small elliptic flow from the geometry induced leakage effect~\\cite{leakage}. The regeneration\non the other hand depends much on the heavy quark evolution. The large $v_2$ of charm quarks due to the strong interaction with the medium can be inherited by the regenerated $J/\\psi$s. The transport approach can explain~\\cite{liu4,zhou2} well the disappeared elliptic flow at RHIC energy~\\cite{flow1} and the sizeable elliptic flow at LHC energy~\\cite{flow2}.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{s6}\n\nHeavy quarks and quarkonia are sensitive probes of the quark gluon plasma created in high energy nuclear collisions, due to their strong interaction with the constituents of the hot medium.\nBy taking into account the cold and hot nuclear matter effects on their evolution in the partonic and hadronic phases, we can describe most of the experimental data by adjusting some parameters in phenological models. However, there exist still some puzzles which are beyond our expectations, like the simultaneous treatment of the heavy quark $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$, the double ratio of $\\psi'$ to $J/\\psi$ yield in some special rapidity, the strong charmonium enhancement in peripheral collisions, and the partial thermalization of charmonia in small systems.\n\\noindent {\\bf Acknowledgement:}\nThe work is supported by the NSFC and MOST grant Nos. 11335005, 11575093, 2013CB922000 and 2014CB845400, and the Helmholtz\nInternational Center for FAIR within the framework of the LOEWE program launched by the State of Hesse.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{svetitsky} B.~Svetitsky, Phys.

Inversely, this provides\na way to extract the microscopic dissociation cross section from the dissociation rate~\\cite{brambilla,escobedo,brambilla2}.\n\nAnother hot medium effect related to the quarkonium suppression is the quarkonium regeneration inside the hot medium~\\cite{pbm,thews,rapp,yan} through the recombination of those uncorrelated heavy quarks. With increasing colliding energy, the suppression of the initially produced quarkonia becomes more and more strong, but the regeneration contribution increases due to the abundant heavy quarks in the medium at high energies. The balance between the suppression and the regeneration controls the quarkonium production in high energy nuclear collisions. There are different ways to treat the suppression and regeneration. Within the statistical\nhadronization model~\\cite{pbm}, the quarkonia are statistically produced at the\nhadronization transition from kinetically equilibrated medium, and all the initially produced quarkonia are assumed to be absorbed by the medium. Considering the fact that\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ can survive in the medium with temperature above the critical temperature $T_c$ and below the dissociation temperature $T_{J/\\psi} (T_\\Upsilon$), a continuous regeneration\nscheme is proposed in kinetic formalism~\\cite{thews} where quarkonia can be both dissociated\nand regenerated continuously inside the QGP medium. In a strongly coupled QGP phase, the charm quark diffusion constant is very small, and the binding force between the two quarks inside a charmonium is still strong~\\cite{shuryak}, especially near $T_c$,  a generalized Langevin approach with additional binding force (${\\bf F}=-\\nabla V$) is proposed\nto evaluate the charmonium evolution, where the regeneration from correlated charm quarks is included.\nMore generally, being motivated by the fact that the QGP produced in heavy ion collisions is a rapid cooling system, open quantum\nsystem formalisms are developed for studying quarkonia in nuclear collisions~\\cite{akamatsu} which exclude the adiabatic condition used in usual treatments.\nSimilar to the open quantum system approaches, a Hamiltonian based\napproach is developed, and through a chain of well-controlled approximations it finally arrives at a generalized\nLangevin formalism, with which both the quarkonium dissociation and regeneration are calculable~\\cite{blaizot}.\n\n\n\\section{Quarkonium Transverse Momentum Distribution}\n\\label{s5}\n\nTransverse motion is developed during the dynamical evolution of\nthe system. It has been well documented in the light quark sectors\nfor heavy ion collisions at all energies. In\norder to understand the production and suppression mechanisms and\nextract the properties of the medium, it is proposed to construct a new\nratio for the second moment of the transverse momentum distribution.\nThe ratio $r_{AA}$ is defined as~\\cite{zhou1,zhou2}\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nr_{AA}=\\frac{\\langle p_t^2 \\rangle_{AA}}{\\langle p_t^2\n\\rangle_{pp}}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"r_{AA}=\\frac{\\langle p_{t}^{2}\\rangle_{AA}}{\\langle p_{t}^{2}\\rangle_{pp}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><msubsup><mi>p</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><msubsup><mi>p</mi><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
