[{"file": "1601.01061.tex", "nexttext": "\n$N_{B^0}$ ($N_{\\bar{B}^0}$) is the number of times the flavor-tagged $B$ is a $B^0$ ($\\bar{B}^0$), $\\xi_{f}$ is the $CP$\neigenvalue of the state being studied (for $B\\rightarrow K_S J/\\psi$, $\\xi_{f}=-1$), $w$ is the probability that the\nflavor-tagged $B$ meson is assigned the wrong flavor, and $t$ is inferred from $\\Delta z$, the measured separation\nof the two $B$-meson decay vertices: $t=\\Delta z/(c\\gamma\\beta)$.  In this measurement, the required common phase that was\ndiscussed above in conjunction with Fig.~\\ref{fig:cp-phase}a is provided by the mixing term $\\exp (i\\omega_B t)$, which changes\nsign at $t=0$.  Thus the time integrated asymmetry is zero and the boost ($\\gamma\\beta$) provided by the energy asymmetry of\nthe beams is essential.\n\nAt the time the flavored-tagged $B$-meson decays, the accompanying $B$ meson is in a pure flavor state,\nand the interference (and asymmetry) is zero; as this meson propagates, its flavor mixes and, after\nabout 3~ps, the $B^0$ and $\\bar{B}^0$ amplitudes are nearly equal and the asymmetry is maximum.  However,\nthis 50:50 mixing occurs for a decay-time difference of about two $B^0$ meson lifetimes, and only $\\sim$13\\% of\nthe $B$ mesons live this long.  This, and the small branching fractions for $B^0$ decays to measureable\n$CP$ eigenstates (typically $\\sim 0.1$\\%), explain why such a huge increase in ${e^+e^-}$ collider luminosity was critical\nfor these measurements.\n\nThe $K_L J/\\psi$ final state has $\\xi_{f}=+1$ and a $CPV$ asymmetry that is opposite in sign to that for\n$K_S J/\\psi$ final states.  Thus, both BaBar and Belle instrumented their magnet return yoke to make it suitable for\nreconstructing $K_L J/\\psi$ final states.  A $K_L$ can produce a splash of energy in the instrumented return yoke,\neither by decaying or interacting in one of the yoke's iron plates, as shown\nin the top panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cp-results}a, that can be used to determine the $K_L$ direction.  That, with the\nassumption of two-body decay dynamics, can be used to infer $p_{B}^{\\rm cms}$, the $B$ meson's three-momentum\nin the center of mass (c.m.) system.  Belle's 2001 $p_{B}^{\\rm cms}$ distribution, shown in the lower panel of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:cp-results}a, exhibits a distinct, $\\sim$346-event signal peak for $B\\rightarrow K_L J/\\psi$ decays at\n$p_{B}^{\\rm cms}\\simeq 0.33$~GeV/$c$ (with a 61\\% signal purity) that were also used for $CPV$ asymmetry measurements.  \n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.9\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/cp-results-KL.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.9\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/cp-results-b.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.9\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/cp-results-c.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{ \\footnotesize {\\bf a)} (top) A computer display of $B\\rightarrow K_L J/\\psi$ events candidate in Belle,\nwhere the $J/\\psi$ decays into a ${\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}}$ pair and the $K_L$ produces an energy cluster in the magnet's instrumented\nflux return.

Studies of $J/\\psi$ production\nis a common activity for the early stages of an experiment because they are a prolific source of\ntagged muons and electrons that are useful for calibrating lepton identification systems, validating\ntriggers and tuning up charged particle tracking algorithms.  Theoretically, inclusive\nand exclusive $J/\\psi$ production is supposed to be described accurately (and rigorously) by\nnon-relativistic quantum chromodynamics, NRQCD~\\cite{bodwin95}.\n\nIn 2002, Belle reported a total cross section for the inclusive, continuum annihilation process\n${e^+e^-}\\rightarrow J/\\psi +X$ of $1.47\\pm 0.16$~pb~\\cite{belle_4c2002}. This was in reasonable\nagreement with NRQCD~\\cite{schuler99}, which had predicted a $\\sim$1.1~pb cross section that is\n$\\sim$(1/3)$^{\\rm rd}$ due to ${e^+e^-}\\rightarrow gg (c\\bar{c})_1 $ and $\\sim$(2/3)$^{\\rm rds}$ due\nto ${e^+e^-} \\rightarrow g (c\\bar{c})_8$, where $(c\\bar{c})_1$ and $(c\\bar{c})_8$ refer to color-singlet\nand color-octet charmed-quark anticharmed-quark configurations, respectively.\n\nHowever, Belle's measured $J/\\psi$ momentum distribution, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cccc}a, has\nno significant event signal in the highest kinematically allowed momentum region, $4.5$-$4.84$~GeV/$c$,\nwhere the dominant color-octet contribution was expected to be strongest.  A MC estimate for the number \nof expected signal events in this high momentum region using a special NRQCD-inspired event generator\nincorporated into PYTHIA~\\cite{pythia} predicted a $\\sim$300 event signal in the two highest bins of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:cccc}a, where no signal is seen.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/cccc-a.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/cccc-b.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/cccc-c.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{ \\footnotesize {\\bf a)}  The $J/\\psi$ c.m. three-momentum distribution\nfor inclusive ${e^+e^-}\\rightarrow J/\\psi X$  reactions near $\\sqrt{s}= 10.6$~GeV\n(from ref.~\\cite{belle_4c2002}).\n{\\bf b)}  The distribution of masses recoiling from the $J/\\psi$ in inclusive \n${e^+e^-}\\rightarrow J/\\psi X$ annihilations.

This distribution has a number noteworthy features:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item  there are no obvious signal events below the $\\eta_c$ peak, where contributions from color-octet production are\n       expected to be strongest; \n\\item the $\\sim$500 event $\\eta_c$ signal corresponds to a cross section for the exclusive process\n       ${e^+e^-}\\rightarrow J/\\psi \\eta_c$ of $25.6\\pm 4.4$~fb~\\cite{belle_4c2004}, more than an order\n       of magnitude higher than NRQCD-based expectations~\\cite{braaten03,chao03};\n\\item the $\\sim 300$~event $\\eta_c(2S)$ signal provided the best confirmation of this state at that time;\n\\item the three lower-mass peaks all correspond to established, spin=0 charmonium states;\n\\item there is strong production ($\\sigma\\simeq 10$~fb) of a previously unknown state with $M\\simeq 3940$~MeV.\n\\end{itemize} \n\nBelle found that the $J/\\psi c\\bar{c}$ component corresponds to $(59\\pm 0.18)$\\% of the total inclusive\n$J/\\psi$ production cross section~\\cite{belle_4c2002a} in contradiction to NRQCD expectations that\nit would be $\\lesssim$10\\% of the $J/\\psi gg$ component~\\cite{kiselev94,berezhnoy04}. The\ncross sections  for exclusive double-charmonium processes (such as $J/\\psi \\eta_c$) are well above\nlowest-order NRQCD-based predictions~\\cite{braaten03,chao03}.  This inspired studies of the corrections\ndue the next-to-leading order (NLO) ~\\cite{chao06,gong08,bodwin08}, and these were found to be large (large enough\nto explain the discrepancy), but such large corrections at NLO raise suspicions about the convergence of the NRQCD\nexpansion~\\cite{bodwin14}.   \n\nBelle's experimental results on double $c\\bar{c}$ production have had (and are still having) a huge impact on the\ndevelopment of NRQCD and, although they are not well known outside of this specialty, they are very important to,\nand highly cited by, practioners in this field. (At the end of 2015, refs.~\\cite{belle_4c2007},~\\cite{belle_4c2004}\nand~\\cite{belle_4c2002a} had 271,~155~and~320 citations, respectively.)\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The mass peak at 3940~MeV}\nIn order to study the peak at 3940~MeV in the $J/\\psi$ recoil mass spectrum, Belle selected events with a reconstructed\n$J/\\psi$ and $D$ meson~\\cite{belle_4c2007}.  In these events the distribution of masses recoiling from the\n$J/\\psi$-$D$ system exhibit clear and distinct signals for recoil $\\bar{D}$ and $\\bar{D}^*$ mesons.  The $D\\bar{D}$\nand $D\\bar{D}^*$ invariant mass distributions  for these events are shown in the upper and lower panels,\nrespectively, of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cccc}c,  where a clear peak at $3.94$~GeV is evident in the $D\\bar{D}^*$\nspectrum but not in the $D\\bar{D}$ channel.  \n \nThe absence of any signals for known spin=1 or spin=2 charmonium states in the $J/\\psi$ recoil mass\nspectrum of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cccc}b, and the lack of any significant signal for the the $3940$~MeV peak\nin the $D\\bar{D}$ mass distribution in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cccc}C (upper), provide circumstantial evidence\nthat the $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers for this new state are $0^{-+}$, which would make it a candidate\nfor the $\\eta_c(3S)$ charmonium state.  However, in this case its $3942\\pm 9$~MeV mass would be\n$\\sim$100~MeV below its hyperfine partner, the $\\psi(3S)=\\psi(4040)$, implying a hyperfine\nsplitting that is about twice as large as the $\\psi(2S)$-$\\eta_c(2S)$ splitting.  This is\ncontrary to expectations from potential models in which the hyperfine splitting decreases with\nincreasing radial quantum number. For states above open charmed thresholds, na\\\"{i}ve potential model\nresults are modified by the influence of coupled pairs of open-charmed mesons. The nearest\nopen charmed pair relevant to the $\\eta_c(3S)$-$\\psi(3S)$ doublet is a $D\\bar{D}^*$ system in a\nrelative $P$-wave, and this should not have a very large effect on the hyperfine splitting, which is primarily\nsensitive to the $c\\bar{c}$ wave function at the origin. These issues are discussed in ref.~\\cite{elq06}.\n\n\\subsection{Probing the $\\mathbf{f_0(980)}$ and $\\mathbf{a_0(980)}$scalar mesons}\n\nThe nature of the scalar mesons with mass below 1~GeV is one of the most long-standing mysteries\nof hadron physics.  Although they have been studied for more than four decades, they continue to\nremain controversial~\\cite{amsler04,achasov08}.  It has been suggested that they are not ``standard''\n$q\\bar{q}$ mesons but, instead, four quark states either of the diquark-diantiquark~\\cite{jaffe77},\nor meson-meson molecule~\\cite{voloshin76,isgur83,tornqvist92} variety. \n\nA way to distinguish between different substructures proposed for the scalar mesons\nis by the determinations of the two-photon widths ($\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}$) of the electrically neutral\n$f_0(980)$ and $a_0^0(980)$ states via measurements of their production cross sections in $\\gamma\\gamma$\ncollisions.  Figure~\\ref{fig:f0980}a illustrates how this works for $q\\bar{q}$ mesons.\nBoth photons couple to the internal quark pair and the  partial-widths are proportional\nthe $e_q^4$.  Thus, for example, in the $q\\bar{q}$ picture for the isoscalar $f_0(980)$ meson, (where\n$q=u~{\\rm and}~d$), the expectation for $\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}(f_0(980))$ is in the range\n1.3~to~1.8~keV~\\cite{munz96}; for a four-quark $K\\bar{K}$ molecule it is more complicated and much smaller,\nin the 0.2-0.6~keV range~\\cite{barnes92}; for $s\\bar{s}$ it is expected to be in the range 0.3-0.5~keV~\\cite{oller98}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/f0980-a.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/f0980-b.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/f0980-c.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{ \\footnotesize {\\bf a)} A cartoon that illustrates the relation between $\\gamma\\gamma$\nproduction measurements and the internal structure of neutral mesons.\n{\\bf b)}  $\\sigma(\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-$) measurements from Cello (triangles),\nMark~II (open squares) and Belle (red dots).

The blue triangles and black squares in Fig.~\\ref{fig:f0980}b\nshow results from previous measurements by Cello~\\cite{cello} and Mark~II~\\cite{mark2}, where\nthere is no sign of any resonance-like behavior in the 980~MeV region.  The small red dots in the\nsame figure are not a theoretical curve or the results of MC calculations; these are, instead,\nBelle measurements with statistical error bars that are about the size as the data points themselves~\\cite{belle_f0980}.\nThe upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:f0980}c provides an expanded view of the Belle results near\nthe $f_0(980)$ mass, where a distinct structure near 980~MeV is evident.  This structure does not have\na simple Breit Wigner line shape because of strong interference with the helicity=0,\nnon-resonant $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ background and a distortion caused by the opening of the $f_0(980)\\rightarrow K\\bar{K}$\nat the $2m_K$ threshold.  The $f_0(980)$ is fit with a coherent Flatt\\`{e}-like lineshape~\\cite{flatte76,achasov05}\nusing parameters determined by BESII~\\cite{bes_f0980}  that takes these effects into account.  The\ncomponents of the resulting fit are shown in the lower panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:f0980}c.  The\nfit gives an $f_0(980)$ mass and $\\pi\\pi$ partial width of $M=985.6^{+1.2~~+1.1}_{-1.5~~-1.6}$~MeV and\n$\\Gamma_{\\pi\\pi}=34.2 ^{+13.9~~+8.8}_{-11.8~~-2.5}$~MeV and a $\\gamma\\gamma$ partial width of\n$\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}=205^{+95~~+147}_{-83~~-117}$~eV, where the first errors are statistical and\nthe second systematic.  The main systematic error on $\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}$ is from the cross section\nnormalization that, in turn, is sensitive to the modeling of the non-resonant $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ background.\n\nBelle also studied $f_0(980)$ production in the $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow f_0(980)\\rightarrow\\pi^0\\pi^0$\nchannel, where $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and non-resonant $\\pi^0\\pi^0$ backgrounds are not an issue. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:f02pi0}a,\nBelle results~\\cite{belle_f02pi0} for $\\sigma(\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\pi^0\\pi^0)$ are shown as\nred diamonds (with invisible statistical error bars) together with previous results from the\nCrystal Ball experiment~\\cite{xtalball_f02pi0} shown as black solid circles with error bars. \nHere again the Belle results represent a huge improvement in statistical precision.  The results of Belle\nfits to the differential cross section measurements are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:f02pi0}b, where a\ndistinct signal for an $S$-wave resonance near 980~MeV is found with mass\n$982.2\\pm 1.0^{+8.1}_{-8.0}$~MeV and $\\Gamma_{\\gamma\\gamma}(f_0)= 286 \\pm 17 ^{+211}_{-70}$~eV; these values\nagree well with Belle's results from the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ channel but with different sources of systematic\nerrors. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/f02pi0-a.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/f02pi0-b.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{55mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.8\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/a02pi0eta.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{ \\footnotesize {\\bf a)}  Belle (red dots) and Crystal Ball (solid circles) results\nfor $\\sigma(\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow \\pi^0\\pi^0)$.

These\npapers all include game-changing improvements in statistical precision over previous\nwork (similar to the examples given above) and include analyses of twenty well identified\nmeson states that include, usually for the first time, consideration of angular distributions\nand the effects of interference.\n \n\n\\subsection{Spin polarimetry for quark jets}\n\nThe strongly interacting particles in the SM are quarks and gluons.  The strongly\ninteracting particles in Nature are hadrons.  Presumably the transition of quarks and gluons into\nhadrons is described by long-distance QCD, but calculations of the processes that are involved are\nhopelessly complicated.  Attempts to cope with these difficulties by using ``QCD-motivated'' models\nhave had only modest success.   Usually, the transitions between quarks and hadrons are parameterized\nby experimentally measured fragmentation functions $D_q^h(z,p_{h\\perp}^2)$, which are probability densities\nfor a quark of flavor $q$ to produce a hadron $h$ with a fraction $z$ of the quark's original momentum\nand with a transverse momentum relative to the quark direction of  $|p_{h\\perp}|$, as illustrated in the\nupper part of Fig.~\\ref{fig:collins-1}a.  Measuring these fragmentation functions is an important\n(but unsung) part of the research program of most experiments (see {\\it e.g.}, ref.~\\cite{belle_frag}).   \n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{87mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/collins-a.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{87mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/collins-b.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{ \\footnotesize {\\bf a)} Illustration of unpolarized (upper) and polarized (lower)\nquark fragmentation functions.\n{\\bf b)}  The principle of measurement of the product of two Collins spin fragmentation\nfunctions using ${e^+e^-}\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}$ annihilations.

This was first discussed by Collins~\\cite{collins93}, who introduced a\nsecond term in the fragmentation, $H_{1,q}^{\\perp h}(z, p_{h\\perp}^2 )$, as a first-order characterization\nof this azimuthal modulation.  Thus, if $H_{1,q}^{\\perp h}$ is known, the azimuthal distribution of hadrons\n$h$ in a jet can be used as a ``polarimeter'' to determine the polarization of its parent quark.\n\nThere is growing interest in the proton's transverse spin structure and\nsome important observables require measurements of quark spin directions~\\cite{quark-spin}.\nFor this, independent determinations of the Collins function are needed, and this requires\nsources of quarks with well defined spin orientation.\n\nIn ${e^+e^-}\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}$ annihilations the individual quarks are not polarized. However,\nsince the spin of the $q\\bar{q}$ system is aligned as either $|J;J_z\\rangle = |1;+1\\rangle$\nor $|1;-1\\rangle$, with no $|1;0\\rangle$, the spins of the individual $q$ and $\\bar{q}$ are\ntightly correlated.  Because of this, measurements of the azimuthal angles of pairs of particles from\nopposite quark jets can be used to extract products of two Collins functions as illustrated\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:collins-1}b~\\cite{boer09}.     \n\nBelle used this technique to make first measurements of the Collins function~\\cite{belle_collins-1}.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:collins-2}a shows the the $2\\phi_0$ distribution for a typical $(z_1,z_2)$\nbin, where a clear $\\cos 2\\phi_0$ modulation, with an amplitude that is six standard deviations\nfrom zero, is apparent.  Distributions for these modulation amplitudes for ten $(z_1,z_2)$\nbins, from ref.~\\cite{belle_collins-2} are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:collins-2}b. Here results\nfrom  492~fb$^{-1}$ data sample accumulated at the $\\Upsilon (4S)$ resonance peak (green points)\nand a much smaller, 29~fb$^{-1}$ data sample taken at energies below the $\\Upsilon(4S)$.  (Since\nthis analysis is restricted to high thrust events ($T>0.8)$, contamination of the $\\Upsilon(4S)$\ndata sample results from $B$-mesons is negligibly small.) \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{87mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/belle-collins-a.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{87mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/belle-collins-b.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{ \\footnotesize {\\bf a)} The $2\\phi_0$ distribution for selected events in\nthe $(z_1,z_2)=(0.4,0.6)$ data bin.

In this presentation, I only had time to cover three of these subjects. \n\nThis broad range of investigation was mostly facilitated by the huge luminosity that was provided by\nthe KEKB collider, which acheived a world-record-breaking instantaneous luminosity in excess of\n$2\\times 10^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, twice the original design value, and that was generally considered to be\nwildly over optimistic when it was first proposed~\\cite{quinn00}.  This bodes well for BelleII~\\cite{belleii}\nand SuperKEKB~\\cite{superkekb}.  We can look forward to all sorts of interesting surprises and unexpected\nphenomena from this facility.\n\n\\section{Afterword}\n\nWhile preparing this proceedings article I was saddened to learn of the passing of my close friend and esteemed\ncolleague Susumu Okubo.  Susumu was a brilliant theoretical physicist and one of the pioneers in hadron physics,\nwith important input into many of\nthe subjects that I touched on in this summary and memories of him and his deep insights\nkept recurring to me as I struggled to digest the subject material into some sensible remarks.    I am\ngrateful for his friendship and all that he taught me and pray that he now rests in peace.\n\n\n\\vspace{.5cm}\n\\appendix{\\bf Acknowledgments} \n\nI congratulate the organizers of QFTHEP-2015 on their successful and interesting meeting.\nThis work was supported by the Institute for Basic Science (Korea) under project\ncode IBS-R016-D1. \n\n\\bibliographystyle{aipproc}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\n\\bibitem{christenson64} J.H.

A talk about the history of Belle is no\nproblem.  The intial motivation of the Belle/KEKB project and essentially all of its\nearly work was the study of $CP$-violation in the $B$-meson sector, and the work\ndone in this area certainly ranks among Belle's ``best results.'' However, while the planing\nand first few year's of operation were almost completely focused on $CP$-violation\nmeasurements, the collaboration subsequently branched out and studied a wide range of physics\nsubjects that included many unexpected discoveries.  To the people involved, each of\nthese rank among the ``best Belle results,'' and I could not argue with them.  So instead\nof even attempting to identify ``best results,'' I decided to confine myself to\nreporting on Belle's early work on $CP$ violation, which covers the early ``history of\nthe Belle collaboration,'' and then discuss a few other results that seem to be\nnot very widely known but have had a huge impact on the specialized areas of physics\nthat they address.  First, some history and Belle's early $CPV$ measurements: \n\n\n\\section{Belle and $\\mathbf{CP}$ violation}\nThe Belle experiment traces its roots to the 1964 discovery that the long-lived neutral\nkaon ($K_L$) is not a $CP$ eigenstate, as evidenced by a small but non-zero branching\nfraction to ${\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}}$: ${\\mathcal B}(K_L\\rightarrow{\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}})\\simeq 2\\times 10^{-3}$, which \ndemonstrated that $CP$ is violated, probably by the weak interactions~\\cite{christenson64}.  \nThis inspired Sakharov's classic 1967 paper~\\cite{sakharov67} that pointed out that\n$CP$-violation ($CPV$) is an essential ingredient for explaining the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse; {\\it i.e.}, how a matter-antimatter-symmetric condition that prevailed right after the Big Bang,\nevolved into today's matter-dominated universe (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:sakharov}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{figures/sakharov.pdf}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize\nWhen Sakharov completed  his famous 1967 paper on ``Violation of $CP$ invariance, $C$ asymmetry,\nand baryon asymmetry of the universe,'' he gave Lev Okun a preprint with a small poem handwritten\non it that identifies $CPV$ as ``S. Okubo's effect.'' This refers to a 1958 paper by Okubo that\nfirst pointed out that while $CPT$ invariance requires particle and antiparticle lifetimes to be\nequal, $CP$ violations would allow partial lifetimes to be different~\\cite{okubo58}.}\n\\label{fig:sakharov}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure} \n\nIncorporating $CPV$ into the Standard Model (SM) while preserving $CPT$ was not very easy.  Wolfenstein\nproposed a mechanism that expanded the SM by adding a new, $\\Delta S=2$ ``superweak'' interaction\nthat produced a $CP$-violating non-diagonal contribution to the neutral kaon mass matrix and\nnothing else~\\cite{wolfenstein64}.  However, the superweak interaction was ruled out by the\nobservation of direct $CPV$ decays of neutral kaons by the NA31 experiment at CERN~\\cite{na31}\nand, later, the KTeV experiment at Fermilab~\\cite{ktev}.  \n\nTo incorporate $CPV$ into the SM proper, one needs an amplitude that has a complex phase angle $\\phi_{CP}$\nthat has opposite signs for particle and antiparticle processes.  Since measureable processes are\nproportional to the absolute value squared of the amplitude, this $CPV$ phase is unmeasureable\nunless it interferes with another process that has a non-zero strong, or common phase $\\phi_0$,\nthat has the same sign for particle and antiparticle processes~\\cite{pakvasa83}.  This\nis illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cp-phase}a, where a $CP$ violating process $X^0\\rightarrow{\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}}$\n($\\bar{X}^0\\rightarrow{\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}}$) has a complex amplitude $A=|A|\\exp(i\\phi_{CP})$ ($\\bar{A}=|A|\\exp(-i\\phi_{CP}$)).\nDifferences in the decay rates can be be measured if the $CP$-violating amplitude interferes with a\n$CP$-conserving amplitude for the same process $C=|C|\\exp(i\\phi_0)=\\bar{C}$.  In that case the \n$X^0\\rightarrow{\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}}$ and $\\bar{X}^0\\rightarrow{\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}}$ rates differ by a term proportional to\n$2|A||C|\\sin\\phi_0\\sin\\phi_{CP}$; note that this interference term is zero if $\\phi_0 =0$.  \n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{70mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=1.1\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/cp-phase.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{96mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.7\\textwidth,width=1.0\\textwidth]{figures/km1.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize {\\bf a)}\n The amplitude ${\\mathcal A}$ represents a $CP$-violating contribution\nto a hypothetical process $X^0\\rightarrow{\\pi^{+}}$.

However, the tests that Carter and Sanda proposed would require data\nsamples the contained several hundreds of exclusive $B^0$ decays to $CP$ eigenstates, such as\n$B^0\\rightarrow K_S{J/\\psi}$ and $B^0\\rightarrow K_S\\psi'$.  In 1983, CLEO reported the world's first sample of exclusive\n$B$-meson decays shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:exclusive-b}a, where there are 18 events in the $B$-meson mass peak,\ndivided equally between neutral and charged $B$-mesons with a background that is estimated to be between \n4~and~7~events~\\cite{cleo_excl-b}.   No exclusive decays to a $CP$ eigenstate were observed.  \nThus, in the early1980's, when the state-of-the-art ${e^+e^-}$ collider luminosity was $\\sim 10^{31}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$,\nthe possibility for checking the KM idea seemed hopeless, except for a few super-optimists who could\nforesee luminosities greater than $10^{33}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ by the end of the century. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{53mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.85\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/cleo-excl-b.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{63mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.75\\textwidth,width=1.0\\textwidth]{figures/lum-history.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{53mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.9\\textwidth,width=0.9\\textwidth]{figures/belle-excl-bcp.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{\n\\footnotesize {\\bf a)} (Figure~2 from ref.~\\cite{cleo_excl-b}.)

In 1974, the fourth quark, the $c$-quark, was discovered at Brookhaven~\\cite{ting74} and\nSLAC~\\cite{richter74} and the fifth quark, the $b$-quark, was found in 1977 by a Fermilab experiment~\\cite{herb77}. \nThen, in 1983, a long ($\\tau_{B}\\simeq 1.5$~ps) $B$-meson lifetime was measured at PEPII~\\cite{mac83,pepii83} and,\nin 1987, a substantial signal for $B^0\\leftrightarrow\\bar{B}^0$ mixing was unexpectedly discovered by the\nARGUS experiment at DESY~\\cite{argus87}.  Taken together, these results indicated that the\n$CKM$ mixing-angle values were favorable for experimental tests of the KM idea.  (The $B^0\\leftrightarrow \\bar{B}^0$\nmixing frequency is now well measured to be $\\omega_{0}\\simeq 0.5$ps$^{-1}$, and not much different than $1/\\tau_B$.)\nIn addition, the luminosity of ${e^+e^-}$ colliders kept increasing in a Moore's-law-like fashion with a doubling time\nof about 2.5~years (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:exclusive-b}b).   In 2001, less than twenty years after the CLEO report\nof an 18~event exclusive $B$-meson decay signal with no $CP$ eigenstate modes, the Belle experiment's discovery\npaper on $CP$-violation in the $B$-meson system used the $\\sim 700$ neutral $B$ mesons to $CP$ eigenstate decays\nwith $CP$ eigenvalue $\\xi_f =-1$ (mostly $B\\rightarrow K_S J/\\psi$) in the signal peak shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:exclusive-b}c~\\cite{belle_2001}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{87mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/b-b0mix-cp.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{87mm}\n  \\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textwidth,width=0.8\\textwidth]{figures/cp-meas.pdf}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace{\\fill}\n\\caption{ \\footnotesize {\\bf a)} A $B^0$-meson can decay to a $CP$ eigenstate directly or by first mixing into a $\\bar{B}^0$\nthat in turn decays the same $CP$ eigenstate.

Here the top diagram is the direct\n$B^0$-meson decay to a $CP$ eigenstate (chosen here as $K_S J/\\psi$ for illustration). In the lower diagram, the $B^0$\nfirst mixes into a $\\bar{B}^0$ and the $\\bar{B}^0$ decays to the same $CP$ eigenstate.  The amplitude for\nthe upper diagram is proportional to $V_{cb}$, which has no $CPV$ phase; that for the lower diagram is\nproportional to $V_{tb}^2V_{td}^{*2}V_{ub}$, where, in the KM formalism, only $V_{td}^{*}$ has a $CPV$ violating phase.\nThus, the interference term is $\\propto V_{td}^{*2}\\propto\\sin 2\\phi_1$.\n\nThe way this interference is measured is illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cp-meas}b.  An asymmetric energy ${e^+e^-}$ collison \nproduces a boosted $B^0$ and a $\\bar{B}^0$ in a ``entangled'' $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ quantum state.  After some time, \none of the $B$ meson decays to a ``flavor specific'' final-state, {\\it i.e.} a final state that allows one to distinguish\nwhether the flavor of decaying $B$ meson is a $B^0$ or a $\\bar{B}^0$.  At that time, which is taken as $t=0$, the accompanying\n$B$ meson has to have the opposite flavor.  Then this accompanying $B$ meson evolves with time, mixing as it goes along\n(either forward or backward in time!) into\nthe opposite flavor with a frequency $\\omega_{\\rm mix}$, and eventually decays at time $t$ into a $CP$ eigenstate.
