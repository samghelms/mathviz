Young open clusters\nare gravitationally bound objects  in distinction from\nOB-associations,  which are loose  groups of O and B-type stars.\nSuch differences between young clusters  and OB-associations are\nbased on the comparison of their mass with the velocity\ndispersions inside them.  The fact that all stars inside an open\ncluster have nearly the same age  gives researchers the\nopportunity to fit the cluster main sequence and colour-colour\ndiagrams  to  model  grids derived from zero age main sequence\n(ZAMS) and a set of isochrones  corresponding to different\nabundances. The result of fitting is  the determination of many\nimportant physical characteristics of clusters, such as\nheliocentric distance, age, and metallicity \\citep{kholopov1980,\nmermilliod1981}.\n\n\nYoung open clusters indicate the positions of giant molecular\nclouds but  unlike gaseous objects,   open clusters  allow their\ndistances to be determined quite precisely with an accuracy of\n$\\sim 5\\%$  as far as we ignore possible errors in the zero point\nof the adopted ZAMS \\citep{dambis1999}. So the concentration of\nyoung open clusters in some complexes  suggests the presence of\ngas there and traces the positions of spiral arms and Galactic\nrings.\n\nWe suppose that the Galaxy contains a two-com-ponent outer ring\n$R_1R_2'$ made up of  two elliptical gaseous rings stretched\nperpendicularly to each other and located near the solar circle\n(Fig.~\\ref{distrib_total}). The sign of apostrophe means the\npseudoring $R_2'$ -- incomplete ring made up of two tightly wound\nspiral arms. The idea that the Galaxy contains  outer rings was\nfirst put forward  by \\citet{kalnajs1991}.\n\nTwo main classes of outer rings and pseudorings  have been\nidentified: rings $R_1$ (pseudorings $R'_1$) elongated\nperpendicular to the bar and rings $R_2$ (pseudorings $R'_2$)\nelongated parallel to the bar. In addition, there is a combined\nmorphological type $R_1R_2'$ which exhibits elements of both\nclasses \\citep{buta1995, buta1996, buta1991}.  Modelling shows\nthat outer rings are usually located near the Outer Lindblad\nresonance (OLR) of the bar \\citep[][and other papers]{schwarz1981,\nbyrd1994, rautiainen1999, rautiainen2000}.\n\n\\citet{comeron2014}  used the data from mid-infrared survey\n\\citep[Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in\nGalaxies,][]{sheth2010}  to find that the frequency of  outer\nrings is 16\\% for all spiral galaxies located inside 20 Mpc and\nover 40\\% for disk galaxies of early morphological types (galaxies\nwith large bulges).  The above authors have also found that the\nfrequency of outer rings increases from $15\\pm 2\\%$ to $32\\pm 7\\%$\nwhen going through the family sequence from SA to SAB, and\ndecreases again to $20\\pm2\\%$ for SB galaxies.\n\nNote that the catalogue by Buta (1995) includes several tens of\ngalaxies with rings $R_1R_2'$.  Here are some examples of galaxies\nwith  the $R_1R_2'$ morphology that can be viewed  as possible\nprototypes of the  Milky Way: ESO 245-1, NGC 1079, NGC 1211, NGC\n3081, NGC 5101, NGC 5701,  NGC 6782, and NGC 7098. Their images\ncan be found in de Vaucouleurs Atlas of Galaxies by\n\\citet{buta2007} at http://bama.ua.edu/~rbuta/devatlas/\n\nThere is extensive  evidence  for the existence of the bar in the\nGalaxy derived on the basis of infra-red observations\n\\citep{blitz1991, benjamin2005, cabrera-lavers2007,\ngonzalez2012,churchwell2009} and gas kinematics in the central\nregion \\citep{binney1991, englmaier1999, weiner1999}. The general\nconsensus is that  the major axis of the bar is oriented in the\ndirection $\\theta_\\textrm{b}=15\\textrm{--}45^\\circ$ in such a way\nthat the end of the bar closest to the Sun lies in  quadrant I,\nwhere $\\theta_\\textrm{b}$ is  the position angle between the line\nconnecting the Sun and the Galactic center and the direction of\nthe major axis of the bar. The semi-major axis of the Galactic bar\nis supposed to lie in the range $a=3.5\\textrm{--}5.0$ kpc.\nAssuming that its end is located close to its corotation radius\n(CR), i.e. we are dealing with a so-called fast bar\n\\citep{debattista2000}, and that the rotation curve is flat, we\ncan estimate the bar angular speed $\\Omega_b$, which appears to be\nconstrained to the interval $\\Omega_b=40\\textrm{--}65$ km s$^{-1}$\nkpc$^{-1}$. This means that the OLR of the bar is located in the\nsolar vicinity: $|R_{OLR}-R_0|<1.5$ kpc. Studies of the kinematics\nof old disk stars in the nearest solar neighbourhood, $r<250$ pc,\nreveal the bimodal structure of the distribution of ($u$, $v$)\nvelocities, which is also interpreted to be a result of the solar\nlocation near the OLR of the bar \\citep[][and other\npapers]{dehnen2000, fux2001}.\n\nThe explanation of the kinematics of young objects in the Perseus\nstellar-gas complex (see its location  in\nFig.~\\ref{distrib_local}b)  is a serious test for different\nconcepts of the Galactic spiral structure.  The  fact that  the\nvelocities of young stars in the Perseus stellar-gas complex are\ndirected toward the Galactic center, if interpreted in terms of\nthe density-wave concept \\citep{lin1969}, indicates that the\ntrailing fragment of the Perseus arm must be located inside the\ncorotation circle (CR) \\citep{burton1974,\nmelnik2001,melnik2003,sitnik2003}, and hence imposes an upper\nlimit for its pattern speed $\\Omega_{sp}<25$ km s$^{-1}$\nkpc$^{-1}$, which is inconsistent with the pattern speed of the\nbar $\\Omega_b=40\\textrm{--}65$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ mentioned\nabove.\n\n\nThe studies of Galactic spiral structure  are usually  based on\nthe classical model developed by \\citet{georgelin1976}, which\nincludes  four spiral arms with   a pitch angle of $\\sim 12^\\circ$\n\\citep[see e.g. \\ the review by][]{vallee2013}. The main\nachievement of this purely spiral model is that it can explain the\ndistribution of HII regions in the Galactic disk\n\\citep{russeil2003}.  This model became more physical after\nincorporation of the bar into it \\citep{englmaier1999}. However,\nthe bar and  spiral arms connected with it rotate with the angular\nspeed $\\Omega_b=50\\textrm{--}60$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, and this\nmodel cannot explain the kinematics of young stars in the Perseus\ncomplex. \\citet{bissantz2003} developed  the model of\n\\citet{englmaier1999} by adding   a pair of spiral arms rotating\nslower than the bar with $\\Omega_{sp}=20$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$.\nHowever, it remains unclear what  mechanism can sustain this\nslower spiral pattern in the disk.\n\n\n\\citet{liszt1985}   criticizes the use of kinematical distances\nfor tracing the Galactic spiral structure. He shows that\nkinematical distances derived for HII regions, HI and CO clouds\ncan be wrong due to kinematic-distance ambiguity and velocity\nperturbation from spiral arms. Moreover, \\citet{adler1992} show\nthat bright spots in the diagrams (l, $V_{LSR}$) which are\ninterpreted as \"clouds\" can consist of a chain of clouds extending\nover several kpc along the line of sight.\n\n\nModels of the Galaxy with the outer ring $R_1R_2'$   reproduce\nwell the radial and azimuthal components of the residual\nvelocities (observed velocities minus the velocity due to the\nrotation curve and  solar motion to the apex) of OB-associations\nin the Sagittarius (see its location  in\nFig.~\\ref{distrib_local}b) and Perseus complexes. The radial\nvelocities of most OB-associations in the Perseus stellar-gas\ncomplex are directed toward the Galactic center and this indicates\nthe presence of the ring $R_2$ in the Galaxy, while the radial\nvelocities in the Sagittarius complex are directed away from the\nGalactic center suggesting the existence of the ring $R_1$. The\nnearly zero azimuthal component of the residual velocity of most\nOB-associations in the Sagittarius complex precisely constrains\nthe solar position angle with respect to the bar major axis,\n$\\theta_\\textrm{b}=45\\pm5^\\circ$. We considered models with\nanalytical bars and N-body simulations\n\\citep{melnikrautiainen2009, rautiainen2010}.\n\n\nThe classical model of Galactic spiral structure  can explain the\nexistence of so-called tangential directions related to the maxima\nin the thermal radio continuum  as well as HI and CO emission,\nwhich are associated with the tangents to the spiral arms\n\\citep{englmaier1999, vallee2008}. Models of a two-component outer\nring  can  also explain the existence of some of the tangential\ndirections  which, in this case, can be associated with the\ntangents to the outer and inner rings. Our model diagrams (l\n,V$_\\textrm{LSR}$) reproduce the maxima in the direction of the\nCarina, Crux (Centaurus), Norma, and Sagittarius arms.\nAdditionally, N-body model yields  maxima in the directions of the\nScutum and 3-kpc arms \\citep{melnik2011, melnik2013}.\n\n\\citet{pettitt2014} simulated the (l,V$_\\textrm{LSR}$) diagrams\nfor models  with  analytical bar. Their gas disks form the\ntwo-component outer rings $R_1R_2$   200--500 Myr after  the start\nof the simulation. The above authors  found observations to agree\nbest with the model with the solar position angle of\n$\\theta_\\textrm{b}\\approx 45^\\circ$ and the bar pattern speed in\nthe range of $\\Omega_b=50\\textrm{--}60$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$.\n\nElliptic outer rings can be divided into the ascending and\ndescending segments: in the ascending segments  galactocentric\ndistance $R$ decreases with  increasing azimuthal angle $\\theta$,\nwhich itself increases in the direction of galactic rotation,\nwhereas in the descending segments  distance $R$, on the contrary,\nincreases with increasing angle $\\theta$. Ascending and descending\nsegments of the rings can be regarded as fragments of trailing and\nleading spiral arms, respectively. Note that  if considered as\nfragments of the spiral arms, the ascending segments of the outer\nring $R_2$ have the pitch angle of $\\sim6^\\circ$\n\\citep{melnik2011}.\n\n\n\\citet{schwarz1981}  associates   two main types of  outer rings\nwith two main families of periodic orbits existing near the OLR of\nthe bar \\citep{contopoulos1980}. The main periodic orbits are\nfollowed by numerous chaotic orbits, and this  guidance enables\nelliptical rings to hold a lot of gas  in their vicinity. The\nrings $R_1$ are supported by $x_1(2)$-orbits \\citep[using the\nnomenclature of][]{contopoulos1989} lying inside the OLR and\nelongated perpendicular to the bar, while the rings $R_2$ are\nsupported by $x_1(1)$-orbits located slightly outside the OLR and\nelongated along the bar.  However, the role of chaotic and\nperiodic orbits appears to be different inside and outside the CR\nof the bar: chaos is dominant outside corotation, while most\norbits in the bar are ordered \\citep{contopoulos2006, voglis2007}.\nNot only periodic orbits induced by the bar and regular orbits\nrelated to them, but also manifolds connected to the unstable\nLagrangian points near the ends of the bar, may contribute to the\nformation of  outer rings and pseudorings \\citep{romero-gomez2007,\nharsoula2009, athanassoula2010}.\n\n\nThe study of classical Cepheids  from the catalogue by\n\\citet{berdnikov2000} revealed the existence of  \"the\ntuning-fork-like\" structure in the distribution of Cepheids: at\nlongitudes $l>180^\\circ$ (quadrants III and IV)  Cepheids\nconcentrate strongly to the arm located near the Carina complex\n(the Carina arm), while at longitudes $l<180^\\circ$ (quadrants I\nand II) there are two regions of high surface density located near\nthe Perseus and Sagittarius complexes.  The term  \"the Carina arm\"\nwas used to designate the part of the Sagittarius-Carina arm\n\\citep[Fig. 11 in ][]{georgelin1976} that starts near the Carina\ncomplex and continues to larger Galactocentric distances. In a\nmorphological study the Carina arm cannot be distinguished from\nthe ascending segment of the ring $R_2$. This morphology suggests\nthat outer rings $R_1$ and $R_2$ come closest to each other\nsomewhere near the Carina complex (see its location in\nFig.~\\ref{distrib_local}b). We have also found some kinematical\nfeatures in the distribution of Cepheids, which suggest the\nlocation of the Sun near the descending segment of the ring $R_2$\n\\citep{melnik2015}.\n\nIn  this  paper  we study the distribution and kinematics of young\nopen clusters and OB-associations. Section 2 describes the models\nand catalogues used; Section 3  considers the morphological and\nkinematical features that suggest the existence  of $R_1R_2'$ ring\nin the Galaxy, and Section 4 presents the main conclusions.\n\n\\section{Catalogues and Models}\n\nThere are several large catalogues of open clusters.\n\\citet{dias2002}  compiled a  catalogue  of the physical and\nkinematic parameters of open clusters using data reported by\ndifferent authors. This catalogue,   which is updated\ncontinuously, is available at  http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/ocdb/\nand presently lists 2167 clusters. \\citet{kharchenko2013}\ndetermined physical, structural and kinematic parameters of 3006\nGalactic clusters. \\citet{mermilliod1992} created   WEBDA database\nof stars in open clusters (https://www.univie.ac.at/webda/), where\npositional, photometric and spectroscopic data for individual\nstars in cluster fields is stored. \\citet{mermilliod2003} analysed\nthese data and derived the astrophysical parameters (reddening,\ndistance and age) of 573 open clusters.\n\nIn the last decade  many embedded clusters (stellar groups\nrecently born and still containing a lot of gas within their\nvolumes) were detected from near- and mid-infrared surveys\n\\citep[see e. g. \\ the reviews by][]{glushkova2013, morales2013}.\nHowever, distances to most of these objects reman uncertain mainly\nbecause of  the variable extinction law in the field of embedded\nclusters. The determination of their colour excesses requires\ndetailed photometric and spectroscopic studies. For example, the\nestimates of the distance to the embedded cluster Westerlund 2\nranged from $r=2$ to 8 kpc, before a detailed study of this region\nhas been carried out \\citep{carraro2013}. In this paper we\nconsider only optically observed clusters.\n\nFor our study we have chosen the catalogue by \\citet{dias2002},\nwhich provides the most reliable estimates of distances, ages and\nother parameters. Its  new version (3.4) contains 627 young\nclusters with the ages less than 100 Myr.\n\n\\citet{paunzen2006} established a list of 72 \"standard\" open\nclusters covering a wide range of ages, reddenings and distances\nselected on the basis of smallest errors from the available\nparameters in the literature. Their analysis is based on the\naveraged values from widely different methods and authors. The\nauthors then compared the derived mean values with the parameters\nof open clusters published by \\citet{dias2002}. They found that if\none uses the parameters of the catalogue by \\citet{dias2002} then\nthe expected errors are comparable with those derived by averaging\nthe independent values from the literature. They concluded that\nages, reddenings and distances in the catalog by \\citet{dias2002}\nare good for statistical research.\n\nWe adopted the proper motions of open clusters based on the\nHipparcos catalogue \\citep{hipparcos1997}  from the paper by\n\\citet{baumgardt2000}, and if they were absent there, from the\ncatalogues by \\citet{glushkova1996, glushkova1997}, which are\navailable at https://www.univie.ac.at/webda/elena.html. In the\nlatter lists the proper motions were derived from the Four-Million\nStar Catalogue of positions and proper motions\n\\citep[4M-catalogue,][]{volchkov1992} and then reduced to the\nHipparcos system.  We chose these catalogues of proper motions\nbecause  of  the careful selection of star cluster members.\n\nFor kinematical study, we also  use OB-associations from the list\nby \\citet{blahahumphreys1989}, which includes 91 objects. Their\nheliocentric distances $r_\\textrm{BH}$ were reduced to the short\ndistance scale $r=0.8\\cdot r_\\textrm{BH}$ \\citep{sitnik1996}. The\nkinematical data were adopted from the catalogue by\n\\citet{melnikdambis2009}. The ages of OB-associations are supposed\nto be less than 30 Myr \\citep{humphreys1984,bressan2012}.\n\n\nWe use the simulation code developed by H. Salo\n\\citep{salo1991,salo2000}  to construct two different types of\nmodels (models with analytical bars and models based on N-body\nsimulations), which reproduce the kinematics of OB-associations in\nthe Perseus and Sagittarius complexes. Among many models with\nouter rings, we chose model 3 from the series of models with\nanalytical bars \\citep{melnikrautiainen2009}  to  compare with\nobservations. This model has nearly flat rotation curve. The bar\nsemi-axes are equal to $a=4.0$~kpc and $b=1.3$~kpc. The positions\nand velocities of $5\\cdot 10^4$ model particles (gas+OB)   are\nconsidered at time $T \\approx 1$ Gyr from the start of the\nsimulation.  We  scaled and turned this model with respect to the\nSun to achieve the best agreement between  the velocities of model\nparticles and those of OB-associations in five stellar-gas\ncomplexes identified by \\citet{efremov1988}.\n\nWe adopt a solar Galactocentric distance of $R_0=7.5$ kpc\n\\citep{rastorguev1994, dambis1995, glushkova1998,\nnikiforov2004,feast2008,groenewegen2008,reid2009b,dambis2013,\nfrancis2014}. As model 3 was adjusted for $R_0=7.1$ kpc, we\nrescaled all distances for model particles  by a factor of\n$k=7.5/7.1$. Note that the particular choice of $R_0$ in the range\n7\u0096-9 kpc has practically no effect on the analysis of the\nmorphology and kinematics of stars located  within 3 kpc from the\nSun.\n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Space distribution of young open clusters}\n\nThe distribution of young open clusters in the Galactic plane can\nreveal regions of intense star formation, which can be associated\nwith spiral arms or Galactic rings. Figure~\\ref{distrib_total}\nshows the distribution of young open clusters  from the catalog by\n\\citet{dias2002} and model particles in the Galactic plane. Only\nclusters with ages less than 100 Myr and located within 0.5 kpc\n($|z|<0.5$ kpc) from the Galactic plane are considered.  We can\nsee the model location of the outer rings $R_1$ and $R_2$\ncalculated for the solar position angle with respect to the bar\nmajor axis of $\\theta_\\textrm{b}=45^\\circ$.\n\nFigure~\\ref{distrib_local}a shows the distribution of young open\nclusters  from the catalog by \\citet{dias2002} and model particles\nin a larger scale.  To avoid cluttering with other objects, we\nmade another plot (Fig.~\\ref{distrib_local}b), where we indicate\nthe positions of rich OB-associations as well. The catalog by\n\\citet{blahahumphreys1989} includes 27 rich OB-associations\ncontaining more than 30 members ($N_t>30$).\nFigure~\\ref{distrib_local}b also presents the positions of the\nSagittarius, Scorpio, Carina, Cygnus, Local System and Perseus\nstellar-gas complexes from the list by \\citet{efremov1988}.  We\ncan see a tuning-fork-like structure in the distribution of young\nopen clusters and OB-associations.  At negative x-coordinates (on\nthe left-hand side)  most of the clusters concentrate to the only\none arm   (the Carina arm), while at positive x-coordinates (on\nthe right-hand side) most of the clusters lie near the Perseus or\nthe Sagittarius  complexes. The Carina stellar-gas complex is\nlocated in-between the two outer rings, where they come closest to\neach other. The Sagittarius and Scorpio complexes lie near the\nring $R_1$, while the Perseus complex and Local System, on the\ncontrary, are situated near the ring $R_2$. In quadrant III, young\nobjects within $r<1.5$ kpc concentrate to the Sun, while more\ndistant objects distribute nearly randomly over a large area. As\nfor the Cygnus complex, its connection with some global structure\n(outer ring or spiral arm) is unclear. However, the kinematics of\nyoung objects in the Cygnus complex is similar to that in the\nPerseus stellar-gas complex \\citep{sitnik1996,sitnik1999},  and we\ntherefore tend to consider the Cygnus complex as a spur of the\nring $R_2$, which can be rather lumpy.\n\nUsing the model distribution, we can quite accurately approximate\nthe position of two outer rings by two ellipses oriented\nperpendicular to each other. The outer ring $R_1$ can be\nrepresented by the ellipse with the semi-axes $a_1=6.3$ and\n$b_1=5.8$~kpc, while the outer ring $R_2$ fits well the ellipse\nwith $a_2=8.5$ and $b_2=7.6$~kpc. These values correspond to the\nsolar Galactocentric distance $R_0=7.5$ kpc. The ring $R_1$ is\nstretched perpendicular to the bar and the ring $R_2$ is aligned\nwith the bar, hence the position of the sample of open clusters\nwith respect to the rings is determined by the position angle\n$\\theta_\\textrm{b}$ of the Sun with respect to the major axis of\nthe bar.  The outer rings do not touch each other because gas\nparticles located on the orbits which cross near  the OLR were\nscattered due to collisions during the  formation of the outer\nrings. We now try to find the optimum angle $\\theta_\\textrm{b}$\nproviding the best agreement between the positions of the open\nclusters  and the orientation of the outer rings.\n\nFigure~\\ref{chi2} shows the  $\\chi^2$ functions -- the sums of\nnormalized squared deviations  \\citep{press1987} of open clusters\nfrom the outer rings  -- calculated for different values of the\nangle $\\theta_\\textrm{b}$. Figure~\\ref{chi2}a shows the $\\chi^2$\ncurve derived for the distribution of 564 young clusters   located\nwithin $r< 3.5$ kpc of the Sun.  We can see a minimum  at\n$\\theta_{\\textrm{min}}=35^\\circ$ here. The random error of this\nestimate is of about $\\pm3^\\circ$. Table~\\ref{chi2obs} lists the\nparameters of the observed sample: the number $N$ of clusters, the\nstandard deviation $\\sigma$ of a cluster from the model position\nof the outer rings, and the angle $\\theta_{\\textrm{min}}$\ncorresponding to the minimum on the $\\chi^2$ curve.\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{chi2}b shows  the $\\chi^2$ functions computed for 10\nrandom samples  also containing 564 objects and distributed along\nthe heliocentric distance $r$ in accordance with a  power law\n$n(r)=r^{-1}$ that simulates the effect of selection (see section\n3.2).

Figure~\\ref{change} shows the\n$\\chi^2$ curves computed for the observed sample of open clusters\nafter the mirror reflection of some regions with respect to the\naxis $Y$. All $\\chi^2$ functions were calculated for the same\nnumber of objects $N_\\textrm{obs}=564$. Sample designated as \"S1\"\nwas obtained from the observed distribution by changing ($l \\to\n360^\\circ -l$) for objects located in quadrants II and III. In\nsample \"S1\" the overdensity associated with the Perseus complex is\nlocated in quadrant III and the minimum of the corresponding\n$\\chi^2$ curve becomes shallower in comparison with that obtained\nfor the observed sample. This flattening of the $\\chi^2$ curve is\ncaused by the fact that the ring $R_2$ reaches larger\n$y$-coordinates in  quadrant II than in quadrant III\n(Fig.~\\ref{distrib_local}). It is true for all values of\n$\\theta_{\\textrm{b}}$ from the expected interval 15--45$^\\circ$.\nHence moving the Perseus complex into quadrant III increases\ndeviations from the rings, and, consequently, increases the\ncorresponding values of $\\chi^2$.\n\nSample \"S2\" (Fig.~\\ref{change}) is obtained by changing ($l \\to\n360^\\circ -l$) for objects of quadrants IV and I, while objects of\nquadrants I and II are left at their original places. In  sample\n\"S2\" the overdensity associated with the Carina complex is located\nin quadrant I just between the rings $R_1$ and $R_2$. This\ntransformation  increases the deviations from the rings for\nobjects of the Carina complex and causes the flattening the\n$\\chi^2$ curve as well.\n\nSample \"S3\" is a result of  the ($l \\to 360^\\circ -l$)\ntransformation of coordinates of all objects (Fig.~\\ref{change}).\nHere the overdensities associated with the Perseus and Carina\ncomplexes lie in quadrants III and I, respectively. We can see\nthat the corresponding $\\chi^2$ curve is practically flat in the\ninterval $\\theta_{\\textrm{b}}=15\\textrm{--}45^\\circ$. The\ndisappearance of the minimum here  is due to the tuning-fork-like\nstructure in the distribution of the observed objects. The mirror\nreflection creates the tuning-fork-like structure pointed in the\nopposite direction (one segment lies at positive $x$-coordinates\nand two segments are located at negative $x$-coordinates), which\nis inconsistent with the position of the outer rings obtained for\n$\\theta_\\textrm{b}=15\\textrm{--}45^\\circ$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering \\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig5.eps}}\n\\caption{The $\\chi^2$ functions computed for several samples of\nobjects designated as \"Obs\" (the thick solid line), \"S1\" (the gray\nline),\"S2\" (the thin solid line), and \"S3\" (the dashed line). The\ncurve obtained for the observed sample of 564 young open clusters\nfrom the catalog by \\citet{dias2002} (\"Obs\") has the deepest\nminimum. The modified sample \"S1\" is obtained from the observed\none by the mirror reflection of objects located in quadrants II\nand III with respect to the axis $Y$, which  is identical with the\n($l \\to 360^\\circ -l$) transformation. In  sample \"S1\" the\noverdensity associated with the Perseus stellar-gas complex is\nlocated in quadrant III.

In  sample \"S2\" the overdensity associated with the\nCarina complex is located in quadrant I between the outer rigs\n$R_1$ and $R_2$. Sample \"S3\" is made by applying the ($l \\to\n360^\\circ -l$) transformation to all objects.

Here\nwe can clearly see  the concentration of observed clusters to the\nmodel positions of the outer rings. Deviations $d$ from the rings\nin the direction of the increasing $y$-coordinates are considered\npositive and  those in the opposite direction  are considered\nnegative. The distribution of deviations can be approximated by\nthe Gaussian law with a standard deviation of $\\sigma=0.8$ kpc.\nThe excess of positive deviations at $d>1.5$ kpc is due to\nclusters located in the direction of the anticenter. The fraction\nof clusters located in the vicinity of 1.5 kpc ($\\sim2\\sigma$)\nfrom the rings appears to be 95\\%, which is in good agreement with\nthe Gaussian law.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig6.eps}}\n\\caption{Distribution of the deviations (minimal distances) $d$ of\nyoung open clusters  from the  model positions of the outer rings\ncalculated for $\\theta_\\textrm{b}=35^\\circ$.

Deviations from the rings in\nthe direction of increasing   $y$-coordinates are considered\npositive and those in the opposite direction are considered\nnegative.

Removing the\nclusters located within the 0.5-kpc region ($r<0.5$ kpc) decreases\n$\\theta_{\\textrm{min}}$ from 35 to $30^\\circ$. This shift appears\ndue to the fact that the outer ring $R_2$ passes through the solar\nvicinity at angle $\\theta_{\\textrm{b}}=90^\\circ$. So nearby\nclusters \"favour\" greater  $\\theta_\\textrm{b}$ values. However,\nthere is also an opposite effect: excluding  distant clusters\nlocated in the direction of the anticenter ($y>2.5$ kpc) from the\nobserved sample increases  $\\theta_{\\textrm{min}}$ from 35 to\n$40^\\circ$. These clusters ($y>2.5$ kpc) are located far from both\nouter rings and therefore \"favour\" the $\\theta_\\textrm{b}=0^\\circ$\nvalue in the case of which the ring $R_2$ crosses the $Y$-axis at\nmaximum Galactocentric distance. We hence tend regard the\nuncertainty of $\\pm5^\\circ$ as a random error of our method.\n\n\nWe made an attempt  to simulate the influence of selection effects\nby assigning to every model object the probability $P$ of its\ndetection. Generally, the detection of a cluster depends on a lot\nof things: the richness and angular size of a cluster, the number\nof resolved individual members  and their visual brightness, the\nsurface density of field stars, and the amount of extinction along\nthe line of sight \\citep{morales2013}.\n\nLet us suppose that the probability of detection of a cluster is\ndetermined mainly by the brightness of its stars. Then the\nprobability of cluster detection is a function of its apparent\ndistance modulus $DM$ which depends on the heliocentric distance\nto the cluster $r$ and the extinction $A_V$ toward it:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n DM= 5\\lg r +10 + A_V,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"DM=5\\lg r+10+A_{V},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>lg</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>10</mn><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>V</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01282.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\noindent where the scale factor $s_0$ and  zero point $DM_0$ are\ndetermined by fitting between the  distributions of the distance\nmoduli $DM$ of observed and model clusters.\n\nTo simulate the sample of clusters we adopted the value of the\nsolar position angle $\\theta_\\textrm{tru}$ and scattered\n$N_\\textrm{mod}=5000$ model objects with respect to the outer\nrings $R_1$ and $R_2$ in accordance with the Gaussian law with the\nstandard deviation of $\\sigma_r=0.8$ kpc within 3.5 kpc of the\nSun, as it is shown in Figure~\\ref{ransam}b.\n\nNote that among 564  young open clusters from the catalog by\n\\citet{dias2002} located within $r< 3.5$ kpc, 408 objects (~70\\%)\nappears to lie within 0.8 kpc from one of the two outer rings, of\nthose 262 (64\\%) are located in the vicinity of the ring $R_2$.

We\nuse seven  surface density values in the interval 0--3.5 kpc to\ndetermine exponent $\\beta$ and its error $\\varepsilon_{\\beta}$ for\nfunctions $n_1(r)$, $n_2(r)$,..., $n_8(r)$, and $n_0(r)$\n(Table~\\ref{sel}). The  exponent $\\beta$ derived for  the total\ndistribution $n_0(r)$ appears to be $\\beta=1.03\\pm0.21$ and the\ncorresponding exponents for different sectors, as a rule, coincide\nwith this value within the errors. The  only exception is the\nsector 180--225$^\\circ$ (5), where $\\beta=1.62\\pm0.18$. The steep\ndecline of surface density in this sector is possibly due to the\nphysical lack of clusters in  quadrant III.\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{surf_den_all}b demonstrates the variations of\nextinction $A_V$  toward open clusters along the distance $r$ in\ndifferent sectors  of the Galactic plane.  We calculated\nextinction $A_V$   for each sector and each distance range  based\non the average colour excess of open clusters located there. Also\nshown is the average extinction $A^0_{V}(r)$ calculated for all\nsectors. The mean uncertainty of sector-averaged $A_{V}$ values is\n0.4$^m$. Several interesting features are immediately apparent.\nFirst, extinction grows most rapidly in the sectors 0--45$^\\circ$\n(1), 45--90$^\\circ$ (2) and 315--360$^\\circ$ (8). Second, the\nminimal values of extinction are observed in the direction of the\nCarina complex 270--315$^\\circ$ (7) and in the direction of the\nanticenter 225--270$^\\circ$ (6). Third, variations of extinction\nin the sector of the Perseus stellar-gas complex 90--135$^\\circ$\n(3) are very close to those of average extinction $A^0_{V}$.\n\nNote that we  found similar features in variations of extinction\nfor classical Cepheids \\citep{melnik2015}. Both groups of young\nobjects, open clusters and Cepheids, show  a sharp growth of\nextinction in the direction toward the Galactic center \\citep[see\nalso][]{neckel1980,marshall2006}. This steep increase can be\nattributed to the presence of the Galactic outer ring $R_1$ at the\nheliocentric distance 1--2 kpc  in this direction. The other\nfeature --  lower extinction in the direction of the Carina\ncomplex 270--315$^\\circ$ -- can also be seen in the sample of\nclassical Cepheids. Generally,  low extinction in some direction\nmeans  that the line of sight crosses interstellar medium with\nlower concentration of dust. Probably, there is a lack of dust in\nthe space between the Sun and the Carina complex. The same is true\nfor the anticenter direction.  Moreover, lack of dust often\ncorrelates with lack of gas \\citep[][and references\ntherein]{xu1997,amores2005}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n \\caption {Surface density in different sectors}\n \\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}\n  \\hline\n  $r_1$ -- $r_2$  &$n_1$&$n_2$&$n_3$&$n_4$&$n_5$&$n_6$&$n_7$&$n_8$&$n_0$&$\\sigma_0$  \\\\\n  &0--45$^\\circ$&45--90$^\\circ$&90--135$^\\circ$&135--180$^\\circ$&180--225$^\\circ$&225--270$^\\circ$&270--315$^\\circ$&\n 315--360$^\\circ$&All& \\\\\n  kpc&&&Perseus&&&&Carina&&&\\\\\n   \\[-7pt] \\hline\\[-7pt]\n 0.0  --  0.5&  50.9& 40.7& 10.2& 40.7&173.2&122.2& 71.3& 40.7&   68.8& 53.3\\\\\n 0.5  --  1.0&  27.2& 30.6& 50.9& 23.8& 30.6& 54.3& 34.0& 54.3&   38.2& 12.8\\\\\n 1.0  --  1.5&  40.7& 24.4& 18.3& 12.2& 16.3& 44.8& 34.6& 55.0&   30.8& 15.3\\\\\n 1.5  --  2.0&  18.9& 24.7& 21.8&  5.8& 13.1& 16.0& \\underline{45.1}& 20.4&   20.7& 11.5\\\\\n 2.0  --  2.5&  11.3&  7.9& \\underline{30.6}&  7.9&  5.7&  9.1& 24.9&  5.7&   12.9&  9.5\\\\\n 2.5  --  3.0&   3.7&  5.6& 13.0&  3.7&  5.6&  7.4& 10.2&  1.9&    6.4&  3.7\\\\\n 3.0  --  3.5&   2.4&  1.6&  7.8&  6.3&  1.6&  4.7&  5.5&  1.6&    3.9&  2.5\\\\\n   \\[-7pt] \\hline\\[-7pt]\n $\\beta$      & 1.08&   1.05&  0.97&  0.89&  1.62&  1.28&  0.79&  1.34&    1.03&  \\\\\n $\\varepsilon_{\\beta}$& $\\pm0.34$&  $\\pm0.35$&  $\\pm0.36$&  $\\pm0.15$&  $\\pm0.18$&  $\\pm0.19$&  $\\pm0.27$&$\\pm0.50$&$\\pm0.21$&\\\\\n    \\[-7pt] \\hline\\[-7pt]\n\\multicolumn{11}{l}{ All values of surface density $n_1$,\n$n_2$,..., $n_0$, $\\sigma_0$ are  in the units of\ncluster$\\cdot$kpc$^{-2}$}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{sel}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Rotation curve}\n\n We use  the sample of young ($\\log \\textrm{age} <8.00$) open\nclusters  from the catalog by \\citet{dias2002} to determine the\nparameters of the rotation curve and compare them with those\nderived from the samples of OB-associations and classical\nCepheids.

The errors of the computed surface density\n$n(r)$  in different sectors caused by the Poisson noise are, on\naverage, twice smaller than the corresponding  $\\sigma_0$ values.\nThe individual error bars are shown only for the Carina and\nPerseus complexes. The surface density $n_0$ averaged over all\nsectors is shown by a solid line. (b) The extinction $A_V$ along\n$r$ calculated for different sectors  and $A^0_{V}$ averaged over\nall sectors (the solid line). The mean uncertainty of\nsector-averaged $A_{V}$ values is 0.4$^m$.

We\nuse seven  surface density values in the interval 0--3.5 kpc to\ndetermine exponent $\\beta$ and its error $\\varepsilon_{\\beta}$ for\nfunctions $n_1(r)$, $n_2(r)$,..., $n_8(r)$, and $n_0(r)$\n(Table~\\ref{sel}). The  exponent $\\beta$ derived for  the total\ndistribution $n_0(r)$ appears to be $\\beta=1.03\\pm0.21$ and the\ncorresponding exponents for different sectors, as a rule, coincide\nwith this value within the errors. The  only exception is the\nsector 180--225$^\\circ$ (5), where $\\beta=1.62\\pm0.18$. The steep\ndecline of surface density in this sector is possibly due to the\nphysical lack of clusters in  quadrant III.\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{surf_den_all}b demonstrates the variations of\nextinction $A_V$  toward open clusters along the distance $r$ in\ndifferent sectors  of the Galactic plane.  We calculated\nextinction $A_V$   for each sector and each distance range  based\non the average colour excess of open clusters located there. Also\nshown is the average extinction $A^0_{V}(r)$ calculated for all\nsectors. The mean uncertainty of sector-averaged $A_{V}$ values is\n0.4$^m$. Several interesting features are immediately apparent.\nFirst, extinction grows most rapidly in the sectors 0--45$^\\circ$\n(1), 45--90$^\\circ$ (2) and 315--360$^\\circ$ (8). Second, the\nminimal values of extinction are observed in the direction of the\nCarina complex 270--315$^\\circ$ (7) and in the direction of the\nanticenter 225--270$^\\circ$ (6). Third, variations of extinction\nin the sector of the Perseus stellar-gas complex 90--135$^\\circ$\n(3) are very close to those of average extinction $A^0_{V}$.\n\nNote that we  found similar features in variations of extinction\nfor classical Cepheids \\citep{melnik2015}. Both groups of young\nobjects, open clusters and Cepheids, show  a sharp growth of\nextinction in the direction toward the Galactic center \\citep[see\nalso][]{neckel1980,marshall2006}. This steep increase can be\nattributed to the presence of the Galactic outer ring $R_1$ at the\nheliocentric distance 1--2 kpc  in this direction. The other\nfeature --  lower extinction in the direction of the Carina\ncomplex 270--315$^\\circ$ -- can also be seen in the sample of\nclassical Cepheids. Generally,  low extinction in some direction\nmeans  that the line of sight crosses interstellar medium with\nlower concentration of dust. Probably, there is a lack of dust in\nthe space between the Sun and the Carina complex. The same is true\nfor the anticenter direction.  Moreover, lack of dust often\ncorrelates with lack of gas \\citep[][and references\ntherein]{xu1997,amores2005}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n \\caption {Surface density in different sectors}\n \\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}\n  \\hline\n  $r_1$ -- $r_2$  &$n_1$&$n_2$&$n_3$&$n_4$&$n_5$&$n_6$&$n_7$&$n_8$&$n_0$&$\\sigma_0$  \\\\\n  &0--45$^\\circ$&45--90$^\\circ$&90--135$^\\circ$&135--180$^\\circ$&180--225$^\\circ$&225--270$^\\circ$&270--315$^\\circ$&\n 315--360$^\\circ$&All& \\\\\n  kpc&&&Perseus&&&&Carina&&&\\\\\n   \\[-7pt] \\hline\\[-7pt]\n 0.0  --  0.5&  50.9& 40.7& 10.2& 40.7&173.2&122.2& 71.3& 40.7&   68.8& 53.3\\\\\n 0.5  --  1.0&  27.2& 30.6& 50.9& 23.8& 30.6& 54.3& 34.0& 54.3&   38.2& 12.8\\\\\n 1.0  --  1.5&  40.7& 24.4& 18.3& 12.2& 16.3& 44.8& 34.6& 55.0&   30.8& 15.3\\\\\n 1.5  --  2.0&  18.9& 24.7& 21.8&  5.8& 13.1& 16.0& \\underline{45.1}& 20.4&   20.7& 11.5\\\\\n 2.0  --  2.5&  11.3&  7.9& \\underline{30.6}&  7.9&  5.7&  9.1& 24.9&  5.7&   12.9&  9.5\\\\\n 2.5  --  3.0&   3.7&  5.6& 13.0&  3.7&  5.6&  7.4& 10.2&  1.9&    6.4&  3.7\\\\\n 3.0  --  3.5&   2.4&  1.6&  7.8&  6.3&  1.6&  4.7&  5.5&  1.6&    3.9&  2.5\\\\\n   \\[-7pt] \\hline\\[-7pt]\n $\\beta$      & 1.08&   1.05&  0.97&  0.89&  1.62&  1.28&  0.79&  1.34&    1.03&  \\\\\n $\\varepsilon_{\\beta}$& $\\pm0.34$&  $\\pm0.35$&  $\\pm0.36$&  $\\pm0.15$&  $\\pm0.18$&  $\\pm0.19$&  $\\pm0.27$&$\\pm0.50$&$\\pm0.21$&\\\\\n    \\[-7pt] \\hline\\[-7pt]\n\\multicolumn{11}{l}{ All values of surface density $n_1$,\n$n_2$,..., $n_0$, $\\sigma_0$ are  in the units of\ncluster$\\cdot$kpc$^{-2}$}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{sel}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Rotation curve}\n\n We use  the sample of young ($\\log \\textrm{age} <8.00$) open\nclusters  from the catalog by \\citet{dias2002} to determine the\nparameters of the rotation curve and compare them with those\nderived from the samples of OB-associations and classical\nCepheids.

Moreover,\nthe rotation curve of Cepheids seems to be slightly descending,\nwhereas that of OB-associations is nearly flat within the 3 kpc.\nThe cause of this discrepancy  is currently not clear.\n\nThe standard deviation  of the velocities from the rotation curve\nequals $\\sigma_0=15.2$, 7.16 and 10.84 km s$^{-1}$ for young open\nclusters, OB-associations and Cepheids, respectively\n(Table~\\ref{rot}), which is consistent with other estimates\n\\citep[e.g. \\ ][]{zabolotskikh2002}. The larger value of\n$\\sigma_0=15.2$ km s$^{-1}$ derived for clusters reflects   the\nquality of the kinematical data rather than the physical scatter:\nall these objects are quite young, their ages do not exceed 200\nMyr and they all must demonstrate the same  physical scatter with\nrespect to rotation curve to within 1--2 km s$^{-1}$. Possibly,\nthe crowding in  cluster fields prevents accurate measurements of\nline-of-light velocities and proper motions. Furthermore, the\nline-of-sight velocities of young open clusters are based on\nmeasured velocities of early-type stars, which usually have low\naccuracy because of the small number and large width of spectral\nlines involved.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig10.eps}}\n\\caption{Galactic rotation curve derived from an analysis of\nline-of-sight velocities and proper motions of young open clusters\n(the black line), which  practically coincides with that obtained\nfor OB-associations (the gray line).

In the ascending segments of the\nrings (trailing spiral fragments) gas clouds have positive\nvelocities $V_R$ directed away from the galactic center, while in\nthe descending segments (leading spiral fragments), on the\ncontrary, $V_R$ is directed toward the center.   This becomes\nclear when we remember that outer rings lie outside the CR of the\nbar. Hence, in the reference frame co-rotating with the bar gas\nclouds  rotate along the outer rings in the sense opposite that of\ngalactic rotation,  i.e. move in the sense of  decreasing\nazimuthal angle $\\theta$. In the descending segments, as defined,\ngalactocentric distance $R$ increases with increasing azimuthal\nangle $\\theta$ (leading spiral arm fragments), but  if objects\nrotate in the sense of decreasing  angle $\\theta$ the distance $R$\nmust decrease. So in the descending segments  of the outer rings\nobjects must approach the galactic center. In the 3 kpc solar\nneighborhood there is only one descending segment of the outer\nrings -- that of the ring $R_2$. Hence within 3 kpc of the Sun,\nobjects with negative velocities $V_R$  must outline the location\nof the ring $R_2$.\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{Vr_neg}a  shows the distribution of young open\nclusters ($\\log \\textrm{age} <8.00$) and OB-associations with\nnegative radial residual velocities ($V_R<0$) in the Galactic\nplane.  The sample includes 90 objects (57 clusters and 33\nOB-associations) located within 3 kpc from the Sun. We consider\nonly OB-associations with the line-of-sight velocity and proper\nmotion based  on data  for  at least two cluster members\n($n_{vr}\\ge 2$, $n_{pm}\\ge2$), and the same is true for open\nclusters. Within $r<3.0$ kpc from the Sun, the elliptic ring $R_2$\ncan be represented as a fragment of  the leading spiral arm.  We\nsolve 90 equations by $\\chi^2$-minimization \\citep{press1987} to\nfind the parameters of the spiral law. The pitch angle of the\nspiral-arm derived from clusters and OB-associations appears to be\n$i=20\\pm 5^\\circ$. The positive value of the pitch angle $i$\nindicates that Galactocentric distance $R$ increases with\nincreasing azimuthal angle $\\theta$ what corresponds to the\nleading spiral arm fragment and suggests the solar position near\nthe descending segment of the outer ring. Both types of objects,\nyoung clusters and OB-associations, give the same result:\n$i=19.3\\pm 6.7^\\circ$ and $i=20.3\\pm 6.4^\\circ$, respectively.\nObviously, these objects demonstrate similar behavior.\n\nNote that the  pitch angle $i=20\\pm 5^\\circ$ obtained for clusters\nand OB-associations differs strongly from the value derived for\nmodel particles $i=6.6\\pm 0.6^\\circ$. The cause of this\ndiscrepancy is that  objects of the Perseus and Carina complexes\ndeviate from the smooth contour of the outer ring $R_2$. If we\nexclude the most  distant parts of these regions, for example, by\nreducing the neighborhood considered from 3 to 2 kpc from the Sun,\nthe pitch angle estimate decreases from $i=20\\pm 5^\\circ$ to\n$i=11.4\\pm 5.3^\\circ$. The  latter value was derived for 60\nobjects (39 clusters and 21 OB-associations) located within $r<2$\nkpc of the Sun. The values of $i=11.4\\pm 5.3^\\circ$ and $i=6.6\\pm\n0.6^\\circ$ obtained for observed objects and model particles are\nconsistent within the errors. The value of $i=11.4\\pm 5.3^\\circ$\nis positive at the significance level $P>2\\sigma$,  which means\nthat the spiral fragment to which young open clusters and\nOB-associations concentrate is leading.\n\nIn this context the  question of the  ragged structure of the ring\n$R_2$ comes up.  Though the deviations  from the smooth contour of\nthe ring $R_2$ can  result from errors in  the parameters of\ndistant objects, there is another aspect of the problem. A\ntwo-component outer ring $R_1R_2$ usually  includes not just a\npure $R_2$ ring but a pseudoring $R_2'$ (broken ring)\n\\citep{buta1995}. Such deviations from  pure ring morphology are\nalso  observed in numerical simulations \\citep[e.g.][Figure\n3]{rautiainen2000} with the break  usually located on the\ndescending segment of the ring. Hence the fact that the Perseus\nand Carina complexes  deviate from the smooth elliptic segment in\ndifferent directions -- away from the Galactic center in the\nPerseus stellar-gas complex and toward the center in the Carina\ncomplex -- may indicate the pseudoring morphology. This question\nrequires further study.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\resizebox{16 cm}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig11.eps}} \\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of the distribution of  young open clusters\n($\\log \\textrm{age} <8.00$) (the circles colored blue in\nelectronic edition) and OB-associations (the asterisks colored\ngreen in electronic edition) with that of model particles (gray\ncircles). We selected only objects with radial residual velocities\ndirected toward the Galactic center ($V_R<0$).

These oscillations are shifted by $\\pi/4$ in phase\nwith respect to those of  the radial velocity $V_R$ and are\nassociated with ordered epicyclic motion of gas clouds and young\nstars near the OLR of the bar \\citep{melnikrautiainen2009}.\n\nFigure~\\ref{Vr_neg}b shows the dependence of azimuthal residual\nvelocity $V_T$ on  coordinate $x$  for young open clusters,\nOB-associations and model particles with negative radial residual\nvelocities ($V_R<0$). These objects are supposed to belong to the\ndescending segment of the outer ring $R_2$ and must show the\ndecrease of $V_T$ with increasing $x$. The regression coefficient\ncalculated for young clusters and OB-associations located within 3\nkpc of the Sun is $k=-1.85\\pm0.90$ and  differs significantly from\nthe value calculated for model particles $k=-3.45\\pm0.07$.\nHowever, if we leave only  OB-associations  we would get\n$k=-3.03\\pm0.85$, which is negative at significance level of\n$P>3\\sigma$ and agrees well with the model value.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusions}\n\nWe study the distribution and kinematics of young open clusters\nfrom the catalogue by \\citet{dias2002} in terms of the model of\nthe Galactic ring $R_1R_2'$ \\citep{melnikrautiainen2009}. The best\nagreement between the distribution of observed clusters and model\nparticles is achieved for the  solar position angle of\n$\\theta_\\textrm{b}=35\\pm10^\\circ$ with respect to the bar major\naxis.  It is  due to of \"the tuning-fork-like\" structure in the\ndistribution of clusters: at negative x-coordinates  most of the\nclusters concentrate to the only one arm (the Carina arm), while\nat positive x-coordinates  most of the clusters lie near the\nPerseus or the Sagittarius complexes (Fig.~\\ref{distrib_local}).\n\nWe studied the influence of objects located in  different regions\non the position  of the minimum of the $\\chi^2$ curve. Excluding\nthe  clusters lying within the 0.5-kpc region ($r<0.5$ kpc) from\nthe observed sample decreases the value of $\\theta_{\\textrm{min}}$\nfrom 35 to $30^\\circ$, while the exclusion of distant clusters\nlocated in the direction of the anticenter ($y>2.5$ kpc) increases\n$\\theta_{\\textrm{min}}$ from 35 to $40^\\circ$.\n\nWe performed mirror reflection of the distribution of observed\nclusters with respect to the $Y$-axis, which is identical to the\n($l \\to 360^\\circ -l$) transformation. The reflection obliterates\nthe minimum of the $\\chi^2$ curve. After the reflection clusters\nform a tuning-fork-like structure pointed in the opposite\ndirection (one segment at the positive $x$-coordinates and two\nsegments at the negative $x$-coordinates), which is inconsistent\nwith the position of the outer rings calculated for\n$\\theta_\\textrm{b}=15\\textrm{--}45^\\circ$.\n\nWe simulated the influence of selection effects by assigning to\nevery model object the probability $P$ of its detection depending\non its apparent distance modulus $DM$.  The probability $P$ is\nassumed to be equal to unity for $DM<DM_0$  and decrease\nexponentially with $DM$ at $DM \\ge DM_0$ (Eq.~\\ref{p}). We\ndetermined the parameters of the dependence $P(DM)$  by fitting\nthe distributions of distance moduli $DM$ of the observed and\nmodel clusters (Figs.~\\ref{his2},~\\ref{min_par}). We computed the\nextinction $A_V$ for model objects  in accordance with the\nextinction of observed clusters located in the nearby region. We\nscattered the model clusters in the vicinity of the model\npositions of the outer rings and computed the  $\\chi^2$ function\nfor 200 model samples. A comparison of the $\\theta_\\textrm{tru}$\nand $\\theta_\\textrm{min}$ values reveals a small bias\n$\\Delta_s=-2.5^\\circ$ which does not exceed the random errors of\n$\\pm5^ \\circ$ (Table~\\ref{chi2mod}).\n\nWe  consider  the value of $\\theta_\\textrm{b}=35^\\circ$ as a good\ncompromise reflecting the combined  influence of different\neffects. The upper limit of the combined error including random\nand systematic errors is   $\\pm 10^\\circ$.\n\nAn analysis of the surface density $n$  of young clusters in\ndifferent sectors of the Galactic plane  suggests  a weak\ndependence of  selection effects on the direction.  We  found that\nextinction $A_V$ toward open clusters  grows most rapidly in the\ndirection of the Galactic center ($l=315\\textrm{--}360^\\circ$ and\n0--45$^\\circ$) and in the sector 45--90$^\\circ$, while it is\nminimal in the direction of the the Carina complex\n270--315$^\\circ$ and the anticenter 225--270$^\\circ$. Note that we\nfound similar features in the variations of  extinction for\nclassical Cepheids \\citep{melnik2015}. Possibly,  the sharp growth\nof extinction  can be attributed to the presence of the Galactic\nouter ring $R_1$ at the  heliocentric distance 1--2 kpc  in the\ndirection to the Galactic center.\n\n\nThe parameters of the rotation curve derived from the sample of\nyoung open clusters  agree well with those obtained for\nOB-associations \\citep[][Table~\\ref{rot}]{melnikdambis2009}. The\nrotation curve is nearly flat in the 3 kpc solar neighborhood with\nthe large value of the Galactic angular velocity at the solar\nradius $\\Omega_0=30.3\\pm1.2$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$.\n\nWe study the distribution of  young open clusters and\nOB-associations  with negative radial residual velocities $V_R$,\nwhich within 3 kpc of the Sun must outline the descending segment\nof the ring $R_2$. Clusters and OB-association demonstrate similar\ndistribution in the Galactic plane: objects of both types\nconcentrate to the fragment of the leading spiral arm \\citep[see\nalso][]{melnik2005}. Within 2 kpc from the Sun, the pitch angles\nof the spiral fragment derived for model particles\n$i=6.0\\pm0.5^\\circ$ and observed objects $i=11.4\\pm5.3^\\circ$ are\nconsistent within the errors.\n\nWe  also found    the azimuthal velocity $V_T$  to decrease with\nincreasing  coordinate $x$ for objects with negative radial\nresidual velocities ($V_R<0$). The regression coefficient\ncalculated for 33 OB-associations located within 3 kpc of the Sun,\n$k=-3.03\\pm0.85$,  agrees  well with the value $k=-3.45\\pm0.07$\ncalculated for model particles.\n\nThe morphological and kinematical features discussed  have also\nbeen  found for the sample of classical Cepheids\n\\citep{melnik2015}. Thus, all types of objects -- young open\nclusters, OB-associations and classical Cepheids --  suggest the\npresence of the outer ring $R_1R_2'$ in the Galaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\n\nWe thank H.
