In the procedure, the specific heat of a non-magnetic analog is measured and used to subtract the non-magnetic contributions, which are generally dominated by the lattice degrees of freedom in a wide range of temperatures. \n\nWe calculate the lattice contribution to the specific heat for the magnetic compounds GdMIn$_5$ (M = Co, Rh) and for the non-magnetic YMIn$_5$ and LaMIn$_5$ (M = Co, Rh),  using density functional theory based methods.\nWe find that the best non-magnetic analog for the subtraction depends on the magnetic material and on the range of temperatures.\nWhile the phonon specific heat contribution of YRhIn$_5$ is an excellent approximation to the one of GdCoIn$_5$ in the full temperature range, for GdRhIn$_5$ we find a better agreement with LaCoIn$_5$, in both cases, as a result of an optimum compensation effect between masses and volumes. \nWe present measurements of the specific heat of the compounds GdMIn$_5$ (M = Co, Rh) up to room temperature where it surpasses the value expected from the Dulong-Petit law. We obtain a good agreement between theory and experiment when we include anharmonic effects in the calculations. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keyword}\n\\PACS{75.50.Ee, 63.20.D-, 71.20.-b, 65.40.De}\n\\end{keyword}\n\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\\section{Introduction}\nSpecific heat measurements are a mighty tool to analyze and unveil quantum critical points, superconducting or magnetic phase transitions and heavy fermion behavior \\cite{Sereni19911}.\nThe temperature behavior of the specific heat can be used to extract microscopic parameters like the effective mass of the electric carriers and information about the order of a phase transition.  Different degrees of freedom typically contribute to the specific heat, and when a set of degrees of freedom is weakly coupled to the others, it becomes possible to analyze its contribution in a separate way. \nIn magnetic transitions, extracting the magnetic specific heat allows to obtain information about the magnetic moments involved, the nature of the transition, and can be used to test theoretical models and methods.\nFor some materials and temperature ranges, one contribution may dominate over the others or have a characteristic temperature dependence allowing to extract useful information about it directly from the experiment, e.g. the electronic contribution at low temperatures. Other contributions, however, may be difficult to disentangle because they have a temperature dependence similar to other contribution or because they are small. This is the case of the magnetic contribution which, in some compounds, is small and has a low temperature behavior with a temperature dependence of the same form as the phonon one.\n\nA common experimental procedure to obtain the magnetic contribution to the specific heat is to subtract the specific heat of an \nanalogous non-magnetic compound \\cite{mori1985new,lora2006magnetic,lora2009doping,VanHieu2007,duque2011field,matsumoto2011local,singh2012relevance,adriano2014physical,vcermak2014magnetic}. Since the non-magnetic contribution is dominated in general by the lattice degrees of freedom, it is not obvious a priory why this procedure should work. \nWhile the analogous compound has the same crystal structure as the magnetic one, the mass and size of the atomic constituents differ leading to a change in the frequency of the phonon modes and, as a consequence, to a different temperature behavior of the lattice specific heat. \n\nIn the present work, we analyze theoretically the above mentioned experimental subtraction procedure. To that aim, we study the lattice dynamics and its contribution \nto the specific heat of the magnetic compounds GdMIn$_5$ (M = Co, Rh) and analyse differences and similarities with the non-magnetic \nanalogous materials  RMIn$_5$ (R = Y, La; M = Co, Rh). \nThese materials belong to the so-called 115 family of compounds where R can be a 4f or 5f atomic element. \nThe multi-orbital character of the 115 materials, with important crystal-field and spin-orbit (SO) effects \nand, in some cases, a strong hybridization between the f states with the conduction bands, produce fascinanting  \nphysical properties like unconventional superconductivity, heavy fermion behavior, and different magnetic phases that are very complex to assess.\n\nThe Gd-based compounds  simplify the physics of this family because the Gd$^{+3}$ ion has zero orbital angular momentum, small SO effect\nand negligible 4f hybridization with the conduction electrons. This makes them a good starting point to study the low temperature \nelectronic and magnetic properties of the 115 series, and get insights about its more complex compounds. \nInterestingly, GdCoIn$_5$ has a more two-dimensional magnetic behavior than its Rh and Ir counterparts which leads to a lower N\\'eel temperature~\\cite{facio2015co}. This may explain the lower N\\'eel temperatures observed for the Co based compounds across the 4f series, and help understand the higher superconducting critical temperature in the Co based Ce and Pu 115 compounds. \n\n\n\nIn order to properly describe the specific heat of these compounds, at least  three contributions must be considered~\\cite{Betancourth2015,facio2015co}: \ni) the lattice dynamics, ii) the electronic bandstructure,  and iii) the magnetic interactions. \nWe perform total-energy {\\it ab initio} calculations and obtain the phonon spectra and specific heat of magnetic and non-magnetic compounds of the 115 family.\n\nOur results indicate that the best non-magnetic analog for the subtraction of the phonon contribution to the specific heat will have to satisfy a compensation effect between masses and volumes of its constituents. However this is a delicate balance that will depend on the magnetic material and also  on the temperature range that makes a hard task the formulation of a general rule. As it is shown in this work, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations can help to obtain the actual phonon background and/or choose the best non-magnetic compound to subtract this background experimentally.\n\nWe also measure the specific heat of GdCoIn$_5$ and GdRhIn$_5$ samples up to room temperature and analyze the calculated phonon contribution for the subtraction. This subtraction has associated difficulties due to limitations of the calculations: these are done at zero temperature and constant volume in the harmonic approximation. The measured specific heats surpass the Dulong-Petit law high temperature value to an extent that cannot be explained by electronic or magnetic contributions in these materials, and that we attribute to anharmonic effects in the lattice.\nWe find that including a semiphenomenological correction to the calculated phonon specific heat, using a single adjustable parameter, we obtain a good description of the anharmonic effects at high temperature, allowing the phonon subtraction.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sec. \\ref{sec:lattice} describes the {\\it ab initio} calculations of the crystal structure, the phonon spectrum and the lattice contribution to the specific heat. Section \\ref{sec:exp} details the sample preparation and the specific heat measurements. In Sec. \\ref{sec:comp} we compare the experimental results with the theory and in Sec. \\ref{sec:concl} we present our conclusions.\n\n\\section{Theoretical results for the lattice properties}\\label{sec:lattice}\nWe perform first-principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory using the full-potential augmented plane waves + local orbitals method as implemented in the \\textsc{WIEN2K} code \\cite{wien2k}. \nThe results that we present here have been obtained within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange and correlation functional~\\cite{Perdew1996a}.\nIn order to better account for the local Coulomb repulsion in the Gd $4f$ shell, we use GGA+U method. This method has already been used in previous works to study other compounds of the RMIn$_5$ family \\cite{Piekarz2005,PhysRevLett.96.237003,Zhu2012}. Due to the localized character of the $4f$ electrons the fully localized limit was used \nfor the double counting correction \\cite{Anisimov1993}. The local Coulomb and exchange interactions are described with a single effective local repulsion $U_{eff} = U - J = 6 eV$ as in bulk Gd \\cite{Yin2006,Petersen2006}. Taking into account that the atomic ground state of Gd$^{3+}$ has L=0 we decided to neglect the spin-orbit coupling in these systems. Both the lattice parameters and the internal positions were fully relaxed considering 1200 $\\mathbf{k}$ points in the Brillouin zone and a plane-wave cut-off $K_{max}$ determined by fixing $RK_{max}$ =8.5, being $R$= 2.41 a. u., the muffin-tin radii of the In atoms. We verified that the calculations were converged in the number of \n$\\mathbf{k}$ points and plane waves.\n\n\n\\subsection{Crystal Structure}\\label{sec:crystal}\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\includegraphics{crystal}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\caption{(Color online) Crystal structure for the 115 compounds.

In general, the structural parameters calculated with GGA are about $1$--$1.5\\%$ larger than the experimental observations, with a concomitant overestimation of the volume of around $3$--$5\\%$. The calculations, however, capture accurately the relative changes in the lattice constants as the R and M elements are replaced.\nAn interesting feature observed in the experiments and reproduced by the DFT-based calculations is the reduction of the lattice parameter $c$ and the increase of $a$ as the transition metal is changed from Co to Rh and from Rh to Ir. \nBoth the theory and the experimental data show that the structures of the La compounds have larger volumes than the Y and Gd ones. As we show below, this is associated with an overall softening of the optical phonon modes in the La compounds. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Elastic properties}\\label{elastic_properties}\nWe calculate from first-principles the phonon dynamical matrix in the harmonic aproximation using the Parlinksi-Li-Kawasoe method (for further details see Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.78.4063}) as implemented in the \\textsc{phonopy} code \\cite{PhysRevB.78.134106}.\nBasically, for the crystal structure under study, a set of independent atomic displacements (not related by symmetries) is defined. \nFor each of those displacements, a supercell DFT calculation is performed until selfconsistency. \nAs a result, Hellmann-Feynmann forces on all atoms within the supercell are obtained. These allow to determine the force constant matrices by singular value decomposition.\nIn our case there are 9 displacements not related by symmetry (see Ref. \\cite{Piekarz2005}) that can be realized \nin a 2x2x1 supercell. To improve the precision, for each of these displacements, we also consider the displacement in the opposite direction. The size of the atomic displacements is around 1$\\%$ of the lattice parameter. \n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Phonons}\nWe calculated the zero-temperature phonon spectrum and phonon density of states (DOS) of the different compounds in order to estimate the lattice contribution to the specific heat. Within the harmonic approximation, the phonon spectrum is temperature independent and we can calculate the contribution to the specific heat as a function of the temperature from the zero-temperature phonon DOS. As we discuss below, at high enough temperatures, anharmonic effects do become relevant and a related contribution to the specific heat needs to be considered for a quantitative comparison with the experimental data. An additional correction is also needed because the experiments are performed at constant pressure, while the calculations are done for the T=0 volume. \n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{partial_phon_Co}\n  \\caption{Phonon density of states for the different compounds studied. The total density of states of each compound is presented with a solid black line. The weighted DOS acording to the participation of the different ions in the phonon modes are presented with other line styles and colors as indicated on each panel.\n\t\n\t}\n  \\label{DOS_phon_Co}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{DOS_phon_Co} presents the total and partial phonon DOS for the different compounds studied. The partial DOS for a given ion is calculated weighting the spectral density of the phonon modes according to the contribution \n of the ion. The transition metal atoms participate mainly on the high frequency optical modes, the R atoms take part \n in modes in the middle of the optical spectrum, and \nall optical modes have a significant In character \n\n\n\\footnote{ A detailed analysis of the different modes for this family of compounds was presented by Piekarz {\\it et al.} in Ref. \\cite{Piekarz2005}}. \nWhen the Gd atom is replaced by Y, the high and low frequency parts of the optical spectrum are only slightly modified, and there is a redistribution of spectral weight in the center of the optical phonon spectrum with a shift of the weight to higher energies due to the hardening of the modes associated with the reduction of the mass of the R ion. \nWhen Gd is replaced by La, however, there is an overall softening of the optical phonon modes (signaled by a shift of the spectrum to lower frequencies). The converse situation, however, would be naively expected due to the larger mass of the Gd ion. \n\nThe observed total DOS difference stems from a reduction in the lattice elastic constants associated with the Co and In atoms in the La compound. Nevertheless, the partial phonon DOS analysis reveals that the modes in which the R ion is involved are shifted to higher energies.\nThis weakening of the elastic constants could be related to the increase of the equilibrium volume of the unit cell when Gd is replaced by La (see Table \\ref{struct}).\nWhen Co is replaced by Rh, the main effect on the phonon spectrum is a softening of the highest energy optical mode which involves mainly the transition metal atoms. The spectral weight of the lowest energy optical modes, which are mainly associated with the In ions, remains essentially unchanged and there is a redistribution of spectral weight in the middle of the spectrum. A similar behavior is obtained for the La and Y compounds when the transition metal is replaced. \n\nAs we will see below, the best approximation to the phonon contribution to the specific heat of GdCoIn$_5$ is obtained with YRhIn$_5$. Replacing Co by Rh in the YCoIn$_5$ compound, there is a softening of the modes associated with the transition metal due to the higher mass of the ion. This softening partially compensates the hardening associated with the replacement of Gd by Y in the GdCoIn$_5$ compound.\n\nThe case of GdRhIn$_5$ is quite different, the best candidate to reproduce its phonon contribution to the specific heat, among the studied compounds, is LaCoIn$_5$. The hardening of the modes expected when Gd is replaced by La and Rh by Co is partially compensated by the weakening of the elastic constants in the La compound.\n\\subsection{Lattice contribution to the Specific heat}\nWe now analyze the phonon contribution to the specific heat for GdCoIn$_5$ and GdRhIn$_5$ to compare with the nonmagnetic compounds \nYRhIn$_5$, YCoIn$_5$, LaRhIn$_5$, and LaCoIn$_5$. \n\nThe top panel of Fig. \\ref{cv_todos} presents $C_{vH}/T$ vs $T$ for all the compounds studied. The largest differences between the specific heats \n are obtained in the range of temperatures $10K<T<60K$, that includes the N\\'eel temperatures of the magnetic compounds. \nPrecisely in this range of temperatures the largest contributions to the magnetic specific heat are obtained and is critical to perform an accurate subtraction of the phonon contribution. \n\nThe result of subtracting the $C_{vH}/T$ values for GdCoIn$_5$ to the corresponding for the non-magnetic compounds are presented in central panel.\nThere is a strong resemblance between the $C_{vH}/T$ vs $T$ curves of GdCoIn$_5$ and YRhIn$_5$. Interestingly, the unit cell masses and volumes of these two compounds differ only by $3\\%$ and $0.77\\%$, respectively.\nWhile the difference in mass is slightly smaller between GdCoIn$_5$ and LaRhIn$_5$ (2.3\\%) these compounds have a much larger difference in volume (5\\%). The LaCoIn$_5$ optical modes are softer and its $C_{vH}(T)$ curve \nlies above the GdCoIn$_5$ one at intermediate temperatures ($20K<T<200K$). The opposite situation occurs for YCoIn$_5$ which has a unit cell volume similar to GdCoIn$_5$ but has a unit cell mass significantly lower.\n For GdCoIn$_5$ the best choice found for the experimental subtraction is YRhIn$_5$ while for GdRhIn$_5$ our calculations indicate that LaCoIn$_5$ should be used (see bottom panel of Fig. \\ref{cv_todos}).\nThe entropy difference ($\\Delta S=\\int \\Delta C_{vH}/T dT$) between the magnetic and non-magnetic compounds obtained integrating from zero up to the magnetic order temperature ($T_N=30K$ for GdCoIn$_5$ and $T_N=40K$ for GdRhIn$_5$) lies in the range $0.01 J/K\\lesssim \\vert\\Delta S\\vert \\lesssim 1.9 J/K$ for GdCoIn$_5$, and in the range $0.3 J/K\\lesssim \\vert\\Delta S\\vert \\lesssim 3.5 J/K$ for GdRhIn$_5$. This difference would lead, in the worst case, to an error of at least $\\frac{\\vert\\Delta S\\vert}{R Log(2J+1)} \\sim10\\%$ ($20\\%$) for GdCoIn$_5$ (GdRhIn$_5$) in the magnetic entropy.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{cv_todos_comp}\n\t\t\\caption{Top panel: Calculated harmonic lattice contribution to specific heat $C_{vH}/T$ for the different 115 compounds studied.

The peak at $T\\sim 30K$ for GdCoIn$_5$ and at $T\\sim 40K$ for GdRhIn$_5$ is associated with the N\\'eel transition. In the high temperature range $T\\gtrsim 150K$ the specific heat surpasses the value expected from the Dulong-Petit law (DP) value  expected at high temperatures. The excess from the DP value cannot be explained by magnetic fluctuations~\\cite{facio2015co} nor by the electronic contribution as the $\\gamma$ value in these materials does not exceed $7mJ/K^2$. We used Eq. (\\ref{eq:cpcvan}) to calculate $C_p$ from $C_{vH}$ and include the anharmonicity correction. The value obtained for the anharmonicity coefficient $c$ is $3.0\\times 10^{-4} K^{-1}$ for GdCoIn$_5$ and $4.5\\times 10^{-4}K^{-1}$ for GdRhIn$_5$. Similar values ($\\sim 1\\times 10^{-4}K^{-1}$) were reported for the compounds R$_2$RhIn$_8$ (R=Y, La Lu) of the 218 family \\cite{vcermak2013specific}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{totCv}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\caption{Top panel: Measured specific heat of GdCoIn$_5$ (circles) and calculated lattice contribution to the specific heat including an anharmonic correction with parameter $c=0.0003$ (see text).

The substitution of an atomic species to eliminate the magnetism has associated changes in the mass of the atom and in the lattice elastic constants which results in a modified temperature dependence of the specific heat. An incorrect choice of the non-magnetic analog can lead to an error larger than 10\\% in the magnetic entropy.\nPerforming a DFT study of non-magnetic compounds we show that candidates for the subtraction can be found that would produce a very low error in the range of temperatures of interest. The non-magnetic compound to use depends however on the magnetic material and the DFT analysis can be used to guide the choice of a proper\nnon-magnetic material for the experimental subtraction.\nThe DFT results for the phonon specific heat can be used directly to perform the subtraction, but we find that there are important anharmonic contributions that need to be taken into account in the high temperature (T> 100K) regime. We find, from an analysis of our experimental results for GdCoIn$_5$ and GdRhIn$_5$, that the anharmonic effects can be taken into account using a single pseudophenomenological parameter.\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThis work was partially supported by SeCTyP-UNCuyo 06C347 and CONICET grants PIP00832, PIP00273, and PICT 2012-1069.\n\\bibliography{phon,115b,devictor}{}\n\\bibliographystyle{elsarticle-num} \n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 24734, "prevtext": "\nreplacing $\\hat{C}_{vH}$ by $C_{vH}$ to lowest order in $cT$, and combining with Eq.(\\ref{eq:cpcv1}) we obtain \\cite{Martin1991a}\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\tC_p = C_{vH}(1 + c T)\n\t\\label{eq:cpcvan}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"C_{p}=C_{vH}(1+cT)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
