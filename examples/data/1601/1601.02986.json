Particularly understanding the temporal variability of magnetic energy redistribution and heating processes. Using three years of observations from the {\\it Solar Dynamics Observatory's} Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Heliosemic Magnetic Imager, radiative and magnetic fluxes were measured from coronal hole, quiet Sun, active regions, active region cores (i.e., inter moss), and at full-disk scales, respectively. We present, and mathematically describe, their coupling of radiative fluxes, across broad temperature gradients, to the available photospheric magnetic energy. A comparison of the common linear relationship of radiative to magnetic coupling\n\nis performed against our extended broken power-law description, which reveals a potential entanglement of thermodynamic and magnetic energy contributions in existing literature. As such, our work provides an improved approach to describing magnetic energy redistribution processes of gross feature classes, including both the large scale open and closed field corona. A general solar atmospheric model is presented that centers on an observationally derived self-similar central engine of the large scale closed field corona, with possible extension to the cooler atmospheric layers ($\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,6.0) of open field structures.\n\nFinally, this work indicates stellar X-ray observations could populate radiation distributions in currently limited and/or undetectable spectral ranges, as well as hold potential for investigations of currently unresolved stellar disk gross feature classes.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:MCEIntro}\n\nThe Sun's atmosphere exists in two phases; one that is magnetically confined near the solar surface and one that consists of the extended atmosphere that interfaces with and comprises the solar wind. The \nsolar atmosphere, observed on the disk and above the limb, can be divided into three distinct regions: active regions (ARs); regions of ``quiet\" Sun (QS); and coronal holes (CH), i.e., gross feature classes.\n\nIt has been established that the redistribution of magnetic energy appears to dominate the heating of the corona (e.g., \\citealt{Klimchuk2015RSPTA}), but the mechanisms responsible for and heights at which plasma heating occurs remain outstanding puzzles.\n\n\n\nSolar atmospheric heating of plasmas to coronal temperatures ($\\log T$\\,$\\ge$\\,6.0) is believed to result from the dissipation of magnetic free (i.e., via reconnection events) or wave energy, i.e., such energy conversion events lead to bundles of nanoflare heated loop strands \\citep{Parker1963ApJS}. However, emerging evidence is challenging the standard coronal heating model, e.g., fast transition region (TR; 4.9\\,$\\le$\\,$\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,6.0) upflows \\citep{Tripathietal2012ApJ,Orangeetal2013ApJ}, and strongly peaked active region core emission measure distributions \\citep{Warrenetal2012ApJ}.\n\n\n\nThroughout the last few decades, extensive work has been carried out on magnetically confined structures (e.g., \\citealt{AschwandenSchrijver2002ApJS,Spadaroetal2006ApJ,Mackayetal2010SSRv,Orangeetal2013ApJ,Chesnyetal2013ApJ}). These works, mainly in relation to the corona, have greatly influenced and enhanced our understanding of solar atmospheric heating (e.g., \\citealt{AschwandenNightingale2005ApJ}), and revealed that both steady-state (e.g., \\citealt{Winebargeretal2011ApJ}) and impulsive heating contribute to their generation (e.g., \\citealt{ViallKlimchuk2012ApJ}). Basal heating at cooler atmospheric layers has been implicated as the source and origin of the solar wind, respectively (e.g., \\citealt{Cranmer2012SSRv,McIntoshetal2013arXiv}), which emanates from open field magnetic structures (e.g., CHs; \\citealt{Lietal2012RAA}). Though investigations have sought the existence of a self-similar magnetically open and closed field heating mechanism (e.g., \\citealt{LeeMagara2014PASJ}; \\citealt{CheGoldstein2014ApJ}), little favor exists for such \\citep{Klimchuk2014arXiv}.\n\nKey in pinning down a single dominant solar/stellar atmospheric heating mechanism of closed magnetic field structures is the linear relationship of coronal X-ray luminosity to unsigned magnetic flux \\citep{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ}. These results are supported by evidence of self-organized criticality (SOC; \\citealt{Baketal1987PhRvL}), where heating events result from non-linear processes over broad spatial scales (e.g., \\citealt{LuHamilton1991ApJ,Oluseyietal1999ApJ527-992O}). However, to date, an extension of this radiative to magnetic description across broad electromagnetic spectrum regimes, i.e., visible, ultra-violet (UV), far UV (FUV), extreme UV (EUV), etc., temperature regimes (i.e., photospheric through coronal), multiple epochs of solar activity, and comparisons between large scale open and closed magnetic field structures (i.e., CH versus QS, etc.) remains unexplored.\n\n\n\nConstraints on plausible heating mechanism(s) (e.g., \\citealt{Mandrinietal2000ApJ}) can be ascertained from energetic coupling investigations of radiative and magnetic flux (e.g., \\citealt{FludraIreland2003AA}). That is, observed intensities are dependent on thermodynamic distributions, subsequently governed by heating rates (e.g., \\citealt{FludraIreland2003AA,WarrenWinebarger2006ApJ}). Importantly, the established magnetic field strength's role in heating models indicates much stands to be learned of heating processes, and possibly variations thereof, via gross feature class comparison studies. Notably, in consideration that large thermodynamic gradients (e.g., \\citealt{ODwyeretal2010AA}) and starkly differing magnetic field geometries (e.g., \\citealt{Orangeetal2015ApJ}) should prevail between these features.\n\n\n\nARs are composed of the hottest and densest plasmas (e.g., \\citealt{DelZannaetal2015AA}), across large temperature gradients, and hence, are the most luminous in the FUV, EUV, and soft X-ray. Of interest to ARs is that the most highly energetic transient phenomena in the solar atmosphere, e.g., flares (FL), predominantly occur in their cores, i.e., ``inter moss\" regions, where plasma of $\\log T$\\,$>$\\,6.3 resides \\citep{Warrenetal2010ApJ,DelZannaetal2015AA} and densities exceed $\\approx$\\,10$^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ \\citep{ODwyeretal2010AA}. Note, AR cores (ARCs) reflect the region between the AR's two opposing magnetic polarity footpoints. Consider, ARC observations favor stable high-temperature emission (e.g., \\citealt{Winebargeretal2011ApJ}), i.e., plasma heating rates much larger than cooling time-scales \\citep{Warrenetal2012ApJ}, while that of other gross features, and cooler atmospheric layers commonly indicate magnetically confined structures far from equilibrium, i.e., that are characterized by narrow temperature distributions (e.g., \\citealt{AschwandenNightingale2005ApJ,Warrenetal2008ApJ685}). Thus, it is apparent that gross feature class comparisons, across large temperature gradients, including ARCs, are of utility for deciphering the nature of varying plasma heating rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{ObsExample_20100630_FeatSelections_Labled.jpg}\n \\caption{From left to right and top to bottom, respectively, HMI LOS magnetogram, and AIA 1600\\,{\\AA}, 304\\,{\\AA}, 131\\,{\\AA}, 171\\,{\\AA}, 193\\,{\\AA}, 211\\,{\\AA}, 335\\,{\\AA}, and 94\\,{\\AA} radiative images, respectively, observed 30 June 2010.

Observational data processing and analysis of gross solar atmospheric feature classes (i.e., CHs, QS, ARs, and ARCs), as well as full-disk (FD) scales are presented in Section~\\ref{sec:MEC_ObsAnalysis}. Within Section~\\ref{sec:MEC_results} we present radiative versus magnetic energy measurements (Section~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_TypWay}), their energetic coupling descriptions via previously established practices (Section~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_LinearPLaw}), application of an extended broken power-law description for description solar atmospheric magnetic energy coupling (Section~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_BrokePLaw}), and the compilation of the previous results for the development of a theoretical coronal heating model (Section~\\ref{sec:Res_CorHeat}). Discussion of these results and our conclusions are provided in Sections~\\ref{sec:MEC_Dis} and \\ref{sec:MEC_SummaryConclusion}, respectively.\n\n\n\\section{Observations}\\label{sec:MEC_ObsAnalysis}\n\nObservational data was obtained from SDO's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; \\citeauthor{Lemenetal2012SolPh} \\citeyear{Lemenetal2012SolPh}) and  Heliosemic Magnetic Imager (HMI; \\citeauthor{Schouetal2012SoPh} \\citeyear{Schouetal2012SoPh}) at approximately 3 -- 5 day intervals from May 2010 through July 2013.\n\nAIA data consisted of the following ten passbands: 94\\,{\\AA},\n\n131\\,{\\AA},\n\n171\\,{\\AA},\n\n193\\,{\\AA},\n\n211\\,{\\AA},\n\n304\\,{\\AA},\n\n335\\,{\\AA},\n\n1600\\,{\\AA},\n\n1700\\,{\\AA},\n\nand 4500\\,{\\AA}.\n\nPassbands image the Sun's full disk approximately every 12 s, with the exception of 4500\\,{\\AA} which\n\nobserves at a typical cadence of $\\approx$\\,30 min. These bands observe solar plasma from photospheric to coronal temperatures with a spatial resolution of $\\approx$\\,0.6 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$. The HMI data are images of the full disk line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field with a cadence of 45 s, and spatial resolution of $\\approx$\\,0.5 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$. AIA and HMI passband images were pre-processed using standard {\\sf Solar SoftWare} (SSW), with the pointing corrections of \\citet{Orangeetal2014SoPh1901O}. Rotation effects between passbands were negligible by using observational time differences below AIA's thermal jitter motion ($\\approx$\\,0.$\\arcsec$3; \\citealt{Aschwandenetal2011SolPh,Lemenetal2012SolPh,Orangeetal2014SoPh1901O}).\n\nAIA 193\\,{\\AA} images, per observational date, was used\n\nto select two CH, QS, ARs and ARCs (e.g., Figure~\\ref{fig:SampleFeature}). For each selected feature all AIA passband and HMI LOS magnetogram data were aggregated, and the typical radiative and unsigned magnetic fluxes measured, respectively. Errors were propagated using a summation of photon counting statistics, and the standard error on the mean. We note here our investigations of solar atmospheric thermal to magnetic energy coupling are carried out via the common approximation that energy flux is proportional to ``data numbers\" (DNs; e.g., \\citealt{Wolfsonetal2000ApJ,Benevolenskayaetal2002ApJ}), i.e., AIA data are not calibrated to physical units.\n\nFor each observational date the typical solar disk radiative and unsigned magnetic fluxes were also characterized, again with errors propagated as described previously. Note, solar disk typical radiative and magnetic flux measurements were derived from a region comprising $\\approx$\\,95\\% of the visible disk (i.e., see Figure~\\ref{fig:SampleFeature}), and hereafter we refer to these assessments as our FD feature. Additionally we point out, prior to FD magnetic field characterizations, sunspot regions were masked (i.e., only fluxes $\\lesssim$\\,$|10^5|$\\,G were considered) to minimize downward biasing effects.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[scale=0.22]{FluxvsPhi_1700-94_SAP=AR-CH-QS-ARC_BadFDErase.jpg}\n   \\caption{Radiative fluxes (arbitrary units) versus unsigned magnetic flux (arbitrary units) for the 1700\\,{\\AA}, 1600\\,{\\AA}, 304\\,{\\AA}, 131\\,{\\AA}, 171\\,{\\AA}, 193\\,{\\AA}, 211\\,{\\AA}, 335\\,{\\AA}, and 94\\,{\\AA} passbands, from left to right and top to bottom, respectively.

Particularly, our results alignment with the suggestions of \\citet{Benevolenskayaetal2002ApJ,FludraIreland2003AA} for two\n\ndiffering dependencies of radiative energy versus that of the underlying magnetic field. However, as one progresses to cooler atmospheric layers, i.e., the TR to the chromosphere (171\\,{\\AA} and 304\\,{\\AA}, respectively), our Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi} results are more consistent with notions of a single linear correlation of radiative to magnetic energy in the solar atmosphere (i.e., \\citealt{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ}).\n\n\nThough not shown, 4500\\,{\\AA} observations compared to that of the underlying magnetic field provide no evidence for thermal to magnetic energy coupling. That is little to negligible variations in its radiative energy occurs for increasing magnetic field strengths, independent of feature. CHs were possibly an exception, as decreasing radiative energies were witnessed. However, such instances were not typical of its CH results in general.\n\nIn relation to the results of Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi}, they reveal as a function of our analyzed features and for solar atmospheric temperatures of $\\log T$\\,$<$\\,4.8 (i.e., 1700\\,{\\AA} and 1600\\,{\\AA} plots therein), minimal radiative energy distinctions\\ exist. However, the presence of a slight ``ankle,\"\n\nat approximately $\\log B$\\,$\\sim$\\,1.0 where a blending of the radiative energies observed in CH, QS, AR, ARC (to a lesser degree), and FD occurs. We point out such results are expected considering the higher plasma beta (i.e., $\\beta$; ratio of gas to magnetic pressure), conditions that should prevail here. In contrast, the ARC results of these regimes are trending towards the believed linear thermal to magnetic energy relationship (e.g., \\citealt{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ}). Relative to other gross features\n\nenhanced ARC photospheric magnetic energies could be leading to frozen-in-flux conditions (i.e., $\\beta$\\,$<$\\,1) at cooler atmospheric layers/heights.\n\n\nIn the chromosphere, i.e., 304\\,{\\AA}, results are consistent with the expectations of a linear radiative to magnetic energy trend, and shows it scales across the gross\n\nfeature classes. These results reveal an emerging distinction between observed radiances of CH and QS conditions, which correlate with similar strengths in their underlying magnetic field energies. Note the\n\nankle identified in cooler passbands remains distinctly discernable in chromospheric emission.\n\n\nIn passbands dominated by emission from upper TR temperatures (i.e., 131\\,{\\AA} and 171\\,{\\AA} passbands), with the possibility of lower and/or upper coronal contributions (i.e., 131\\,{\\AA}; \\citealt{ODwyeretal2010AA,DelZannaetal2011AA,Schmelzetal2013SoPh,Boerneretal2014SoPh}), the ankle\n\nstructure of cooler atmospheric layers has ``smoothed\" out. However TR radiative versus magnetic energy distributions give rise to signatures of an knee and ankle.\n\nThe knee corresponding to CH conditions that is distributed downward to lower radiative energies than other studied feature classes; observations consistent with suggestions of \\cite{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ} for regions dominated by single polarity magnetic fluxes. The ankle, emerging where a portion of ARC observations have ``migrated\" to higher energies, compared to their AR counterparts.\n\nIn the middle corona, described here by AIA's 193\\,{\\AA} and 211\\,{\\AA} passbands (6.2\\,$\\lesssim$\\,$\\log T$\\,$\\lesssim$\\,6.3; Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi}), results are generally similar to those of the TR. The only distinction of coronal to TR exists in a comparison of their CH and QS radiative energy distributions. Both are characterized by decreased radiative energy distributions relative to other analyzed features. The ``upper TR -- coronal\" ARC ankle suggest the possibility of heating not direct attributable to the magnetic field. Notions that algin with recent challenges to the standard coronal heating model interpretation \\citep{Parker1983GApFD}. Particularly, observations of inversely proportional emission measure (EM) to underlying field strengths of ARCs\n\n\\citep{Warrenetal2012ApJ}, as well as the absence of non-thermal velocity to temperature trends \\citep{BrooksWarren2015arXiv}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt hotter coronal temperatures, i.e., those of 335\\,{\\AA} and 94\\,{\\AA} observations, similar characteristics prevail to that of the middle corona, and to lesser degree the TR. In opposition to cooler regions, however, at upper coronal regimes the upper ARC ankle appears smoother.

Particularly the 131\\,{\\AA}\n\nknee region, and general radiative versus magnetic flux evolution is more reminiscent of hotter coronal passbands. TR lower fits provide reasonable descriptions (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}), and we emphasize their ability to catch the ensuing migration of a class of solar atmospheric structures away (downward) from the typically established linear relation.\n\nFor increasing coronal temperatures, our lower fits approximate well the\n\nknee, and highlight in general a clear dependence on large scale solar atmospheric temperature regimes (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}).\n\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:PLI_SF_VsLogT} provides our resultant upper and lower fit parameters (i.e., scale factor, $a$, and power law index, $p$) versus temperature.

That is, across broad solar atmospheric spatial ranges radiative fluxes linearly scale with those of the underlying magnetic field. \n\nIn relation to observations of $\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,4.8 plasmas (i.e., $\\lambda$\\,$\\ge$\\,304\\,{\\AA}), lower fits (i.e., $|B|$\\,$\\le$\\,15 G) correlate with a region of decreasing magnetic energy for enhanced radiative fluxes, i.e., a previously highlighted ankle\n\n($\\S$~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_TypWay}). The chromospheric fit (304\\,{\\AA}) aligns more approximately with that of the upper distribution, relative to those observed for the 1600\\,{\\AA} and 1700\\,{\\AA} passbands. The appearance of a downward drifted chromospheric radiative to magnetic energy distribution, again relative to cooler passbands, could be indicative to the presence/formation of predominately open-fields, which give rise to a\n\nknee (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}).\n\nAt TR temperature regimes, the afore described\n\nknee is more readily discernable, and resulting in a turning of the lower fit distribution downward. It is pointed out, 131\\,{\\AA} to 171\\,{\\AA} comparisons in Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits} support speculations regarding emission line uncertainties observed by the 131\\,{\\AA} passband, with gross feature class dependence (e.g., \\citealt{ODwyeretal2010AA,Schmelzetal2013SoPh,Boerneretal2014SoPh}). Particularly the 131\\,{\\AA}\n\nknee region, and general radiative versus magnetic flux evolution is more reminiscent of hotter coronal passbands. TR lower fits provide reasonable descriptions (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}), and we emphasize their ability to catch the ensuing migration of a class of solar atmospheric structures away (downward) from the typically established linear relation.\n\nFor increasing coronal temperatures, our lower fits approximate well the\n\nknee, and highlight in general a clear dependence on large scale solar atmospheric temperature regimes (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}).\n\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:PLI_SF_VsLogT} provides our resultant upper and lower fit parameters (i.e., scale factor, $a$, and power law index, $p$) versus temperature. As observed, $a_u$ and $a_l$\n\nare consistent with the results presented in $\\S$~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_LinearPLaw} (e.g., Figure~\\ref{fig:PLIVsLogT}). That is, they are supportive evidence for a correlation with typical solar atmospheric DEM distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons of our $p_u(\\log T)$ results to previous works reveals the following. First, an upper coronal result of $\\langle p_u \\rangle$\\,$=$\\,1.21\\,$\\pm$\\,0.08 (i.e., derived from the 94\\,{\\AA} and 335\\,{\\AA} passbands), is consistent with the combined data description of \\citet{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ}, and \\citet{Fisheretal1998ApJ}, i.e., $p$\\,$=$\\,1.19\\,$\\pm$\\,0.04. For 4.8\\,$\\le$\\,$\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,6.2 we find $\\langle p_u \\rangle$\\,$=$\\,0.89\\,$\\pm$\\,0.10, which agrees with \\citet{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ}'s reports for XBPs, QS (no averaging), and dwarf stars. Tabulating $\\langle p_u \\rangle$ independent of solar atmospheric temperature (i.e., only for $\\log T$\\,$\\ge$\\,4.8), gives a typical power-law index of \\,0.98\\,$\\pm$\\,0.17.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n \\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{ModelSchematicDiagram_MoreLoops.jpg}\n   \\caption{Cartoon schematics of our proposed theoretical solar atmospheric heating descriptions and subsequent energy redistribution processes, as well as their relationship to the predominately closed coronal magnetic field environment.}\\label{fig:CorHeat_Model}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe $p_u$\\,$\\approx$\\,0.98 supports self-similar plasma heating of the predominately closed field corona, while providing important evidence for an extension to cooler atmospheric layers.\n\nOur $p_{u,l}$ distributions favor a linear correlation of $p$ (parameter describing the energetic relationship of magnetic to radiative fluxes) with temperature (Figure~\\ref{fig:PLI_SF_VsLogT}).

Note, $\\log T_w$ correlates with TR upturns of our $a$ results (Figure~\\ref{fig:PLI_SF_VsLogT}), and feature dependent derived power-law indices (Figure~\\ref{fig:PLIVsLogT}). We hypothesize, as Equation~\\ref{eqn:P=TG} favors, across the bulk of the solar atmospheric temperature space the efficiency of magnetic energy redistribution approximately linearly scales; assumptions that are supported by the following. Linear correlations of temperature to EM distributions (e.g., \\citealt{Warrenetal2012ApJ,DelZannaetal2015AA}), and pressure and loop length (e.g., \\citealt{Rosneretal1978ApJ,KanoTsuneta1995ApJ}) have been previously established, while evidence for significant $\\log T$\\,$\\approx$\\,6.0 -- 6.5 unresolved emission exists (e.g., \\citealt{DelZannaMason2003AA,ViallKlimchuk2012ApJ}). Thereby, it's necessary here to explain the ``obscured\" $\\log T_w$ radiative observations in our magnetic coupling descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a simplified plane parallel solar atmosphere segmented into cool ($\\log T$\\,$<$\\,5.9), warm ($\\log T_w$), and hot ($\\log T$\\,$>$6.3) layers (Figure~\\ref{fig:CorHeat_Model}), each of which experiences local heating via the freely available magnetic energy (i.e., $H_{cool}$, $H_{warm}$, and $H_{hot}$, respectively; Equation~\\ref{eqn:P=TG}). Cool atmospheric heating, ``chromospheric evaporation\" $E_{cool}$ (e.g., \\citealt{Fisheretal1985ApJ,CraigMcClymont1986ApJ,Hansteenetal2010ApJ718}), would contribute to warm enhanced plasma emission.\n\nAdditionally, under the standard coronal heating picture (e.g., \\citealt{Oluseyietal1999ApJ524-1105O,Oluseyietal1999ApJ527-992O}), downward conducted hot layer heat flux ($C_{hot}$) would provide a source of radiatively bright warm emission.

These solutions offer further supportive to our previous speculations of the source of the $\\log T_w$ magnetic energy redistribution dip. We also emphasize, these results align with the proposed three classes of loop solutions presented by \\citet{Oluseyietal1999ApJ524-1105O,Oluseyietal1999ApJ527-992O}, i.e.,\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[1.] Radiation dominated, where $H$ is large and $d T/dz$ is small,\n\\item[2.] Classical, where both $H$ and $d T/dz$ are intermediate, and\n\\item[3.] Conduction dominated, where $H$ is small and $d T/dz$ is large,\n\\end{enumerate}\nrespectively. \nHere we wish to point out, it is recognized no discussions were presented in relation to the driver of our hypothesized local heating ($H$), nor temporal variability, and as such we briefly discuss these below.\n\nNote, the Sun's atmospheric is not hydrostatic \\citep{Oluseyietal1999ApJ524-1105O,Oluseyietal1999ApJ527-992O}, nor does the corona's mass decrease over time \\citep{Hansteenetal2010ApJ718,Guerreiro2013ApJ}. In that regards, we would expect time-dependent heating processes, such as postulated here, would lead to near continuous plasma heating/cooling and mass redistribution \\citep{Hansteenetal2010ApJ718}, e.g., plasma heating driven by field line stress build up and dissipation (e.g., \\citealt{Klimchuk2006SoPh}) from photospheric convective motions and magnetic field recycling \\citep{Berger1997PhDT,Bergeretal1997SPD}.\n\nRecognizing the presence of knee and ankle structures, and energetic scatter about (mainly above) strict $p_u(\\log T)$ descriptions (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}), we would expect additional plasma heating beyond that provided by footpoint motions. For example, the dominant heating mechanism married to a diffuse background component as proposed in recent works \\citep{UritskyDavila2014ApJ,Tan2014ApJ}, and/or plasma heating via magnetohydrodynamic wave dissipation (e.g., \\citealt{HollwegYang1988JGR,PoedtsGroof2004ESASP}).\n\nAdditionally the role of radiative losses in our model discussions have been avoided.\n\nNote, radiative loss energy depletion scales as the density squared (Equation~\\ref{Eqn:SimplEngCons}), while it is widely known $n_e$ decreases for increasing $z$. Shorter cooler loops of our proposed model (Figure~\\ref{fig:CorHeat_Model}), characterized by apex densities  greater than their hot counterparts \\citep{Hansteenetal2014Sci}, would experience more efficient energy depletion via radiative losses, compared to thermal conduction dominated losses of the longer, hotter, loops \\citep{Spadaroetal2006ApJ,Hansteenetal2010ApJ718,Guerreiro2013ApJ}. Thus, in relation to our model, local heating presumably occurs self-consistently across all layers, where progressively cooler atmospheric layers experience more efficient radiative cooling \\citep{Hansteenetal2014Sci}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:MEC_Dis}\n\n\n\n\nUsing the common practice of a strict linear expression for radiative to magnetic energy coupling (Equation~\\ref{eqn:PevFit}), energetic descriptions (i.e., $p$) of CHs, QS, ARs, ARCs, and FD features revealed consistencies to previous literature (i.e., $\\S$~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_LinearPLaw}). However, given our broad electromagnetic spectrum coverage, observational consistencies were confined to similarly studied portions of the spectrum, i.e., soft X-ray. Our magnetic energy coupling study, including both predominantly large scale open and closed magnetic fields, indicated a single atmospheric heating description, particularly for coronal temperature regimes (i.e., $\\log T$\\,$\\ge$\\,6.0) was more appropriately described via a broken power-law (i.e., $\\S$~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_BrokePLaw}). Results which favor notions for differing central engines of the open and closed field corona (e.g., \\citealt{Klimchuk2014arXiv}).\n\nHowever, at progressively cooler atmospheric layers, i.e., $\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,6.0, evidence for differing open versus closed field central engines became increasingly blurred (e.g., $\\S$~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_BrokePLaw} and Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}).\n\nSpecifically, results indicated\n\nchromospheric to upper TR regimes of CHs favored self-similar plasma heating to QS, FD, and a to a lesser degree ARs (Figures~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi} and \\ref{fig:PLIVsLogT}).\n\n\nThe QS energetic distributions, for $\\log T$\\,$\\ge$\\,6.0, overlap with that of CHs found here (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi}), could point to presence of self-similar processes leading to open-field structures, i.e., interchange reconnection events leading to jets (e.g., \\citealt{YokoyamaShibata1995Natur}). Speculations consistent with the finds of \\cite{Orangeetal2015ApJ}, whose QS evidence of such energy redistribution events were characterized by differing visibly bright radiative signatures, compared to other gross features, due to the QS large scale magnetic field geometry. \nNote, due to the general QS geometry, some jets therein are characterized as loop brightenings resultant from opposing horizontal flows (e.g., \\citealt{Shibataetal1994xspy,YokoyamaShibata1996PASJ}). Therefore we hypothesize physical processes attributed to CH formation could be common in QS conditions, where large scale magnetic field geometries lead to radiative observations of more ``diffusely\" heated plasma. We emphasize, such suggestions align with evidence for the ubiquitous occurrence of solar atmospheric jet phenomena (e.g., \\citealt{Shimojoetal1998SoPh,ShimojoShibata2000AdSpR}).\n\n\nThe ARC's upper TR -- lower corona ankle of radiative to magnetic flux comparisons (i.e., Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi}) was speculated as an additional heating component not related to the freely available magnetic energy.\n\nIts nearly linearly related radiative to magnetic energy distribution from lower chromospheric through upper coronal emission could be a result of\n\nubiquitous plasma heating across all solar atmospheric layers, i.e., runaway SOC events. Events\n\nakin to the coupled diffuse heating component with energy dissipation from SOC-like avalanches \\citep{UritskyDavila2014ApJ}.\n\n\nInterestingly, our ARC ankle\n\ncorrelates with the region typically considered as ``unresolved\" (e.g., 6.0\\,$\\le$\\,$\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,6.5; \\citealt{DelZannaetal2015AA}), where \\cite{Warrenetal2012ApJ} indicated a switch occurs in EM distributions relation to the underlying magnetic field strength (e.g., see their Figure 9). Thus, our ARC data set is considered supportive to notions for both high and low frequency impulsive heating (e.g., \\citealt{Warrenetal2012ApJ}), as well as a challenge to current coronal heating models (e.g., \\citealt{BrooksWarren2015arXiv}).\n\nHowever, as we have only statistically sampled these features we provide no discussions if such speculations relates to the age of the AR (e.g., see \\citealt{SchmelzPathak2012ApJ}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough our modeled atmosphere (Figure~\\ref{fig:CorHeat_Model}) represents extremely generalized descriptions of the complex coronal heating problem (e.g., \\citealt{Klimchuk2006SoPh}), we emphasize its alignment with the lukewarm loop\n\nmodel of \\cite{Oluseyietal1999ApJ524-1105O,Oluseyietal1999ApJ527-992O}. Note, their model predicted the appearance of CHs in the upper TR and corona, network element width with temperature, and TR plasma downflows. Of distinct importance, our work possibly provides a key missing element to the \\cite{Oluseyietal1999ApJ524-1105O,Oluseyietal1999ApJ527-992O} study -- the single dominant generation mechanism (i.e., Equation~\\ref{eqn:P=TG}).

Note these data provided coverage of photospheric (i.e., visible) through upper coronal plasmas (i.e., soft X-ray) of the predominantly open and closed coronal magnetic field environments of the gross feature classes dominating the solar disk, independent of activity phase.\n\nRadiative to magnetic energy coupling assessments were carried out with and without feature dependence. First, with feature dependence by using the typical approach, i.e., Equation~\\ref{eqn:PevFit}. These results revealed consistencies to existing literature (e.g., \\citealt{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ}) at similarly analyzed energy ranges (i.e., soft X-ray), while highlighting a possible entanglement of thermodynamic and magnetic energy contributions in such approaches (Figure~\\ref{fig:PLI_SF_VsLogT}). An improved method using Equation~\\ref{eqn:FvsB_BPL}, a broken power-law (Figure~\\ref{fig:FvsPhi_2Fits}), was applied to our data without feature dependence. This description reasonably approximated magnetic energy redistribution across previously unexplored (to best of our knowledge) temperature regimes of the predominantly open and closed field corona. Evidence for temperature dependent magnetic energy redistribution from chromospheric through coronal regimes (i.e, Equation~\\ref{eqn:P=TG}), revealed in this analysis, was utilized to develop a simple theoretical coronal heating model in $\\S$~\\ref{sec:Res_CorHeat}.\n\nOur work supported the expected fundamentally differing heating in regimes dominated by single polarity magnetic flux, i.e., closed versus open field heating (e.g., \\citealt{Pevtsovetal2003ApJ,Klimchuk2006SoPh}). However, as such evidence was limited to coronal regimes, this work significantly elevates the role of cooler atmospheric studies (i.e., $\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,6.0) in identifying the source and origin of CHs, and solar wind mass feeding \\citep{Orangeetal2015ApJ}. Moreover, it has suggested the inferred fundamental difference of open to closed field plasma heating is possibly similar to that of jets and flares (e.g., \\citealt{Shibataetal1992PASJ,WangSheely1993ApJ,Wangetal1996Sci,Shibataetal1997ASPC}).\n\nOur observationally derived dependence of magnetic energy redistribution with temperature (Equation~\\ref{eqn:P=TG}) provides the first (to best of our knowledge) evidence of previously speculated notions, e.g., \\citealt{Longcope1998ApJ,LongcopeKankelborg1999ApJ}. We emphasize, these results raise interesting prospects for studies detailing similar physical processes under differing plasma conditions \\citep{Orangeetal2014SoPh1557O}. Our model, founded upon Equation~\\ref{eqn:P=TG}, aligned well with the works of \\cite{Oluseyietal1999ApJ524-1105O,Oluseyietal1999ApJ527-992O}, and provided significant provisions to the scope of these studies. Specifically, our work provided the unknown single generation mechanism missing from theirs.\n\n\nDistinctly interesting to this work is\n\nthe average solar DEM is obtained irrespective of gross feature (e.g., \\citealt{RaymondDolye1981ApJ,Athay1981ApJ}), as well as is appropriate for stars \\citep{AntiochosNoci1986ApJ}. Note, such indicates a single mechanism as the source of plasma emission  \\citep{Oluseyietal1999ApJ524-1105O}.\n\nIrrespective of our gross feature analyses, and at full disk scales, $p(\\log T)$ descriptions were reminiscent to typical solar DEMs. Straightforwardly then, our $p(\\log T)$ results favor a single heating mechanism, while potentially revealing its intimate connection to DEMs (i.e., see $\\S$~\\ref{sec:RadVsMag_LinearPLaw} and Figure~\\ref{fig:PLIVsLogT}).\n\nThereby, this work casts new light on the utility of narrowband observations as ad hoc tools for extrapolating solar atmospheric thermodynamic profiles; speculations with far reaching applications to the fields of solar and stellar physics.\n\nThis study has addressed SDO's objective to increase our understanding of the origin of solar activity \\citep{Pesnelletal2012SoPh}. In addition, this study has indicated proxies that hold significant potential for the field of stellar physics. Mainly possible means for probing distant stellar sources in currently difficult and/or undetectable energy ranges, and techniques for extrapolating radiative to magnetic field characteristics of gross feature classes via unresolved stellar disk observations. Therefore, our work elevates SDO's extensive data archive as a tool for enhancing our understanding of stellar physics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\n\nA portion of this work has been supported by OrangeWave Innovative Science's solar physics objective.
