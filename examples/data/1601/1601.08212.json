They may appear as stable (hexagonal lattice of skyrmions) or metastable states (isolated skyrmions) in magnetic materials as a result of the interplay between  Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) \\cite{Dzyaloshinskii,Moriya}, applied magnetic field and/or uniaxial anisotropy. Their nontrivial topology gives rise to intriguing dynamic properties such as topological Hall effect \\cite{TopHall}, skyrmion Hall effect \\cite{SkHall} and unconventional electromagnetic behavior \\cite{Jonietz_10, Schulz_12}. The theory of thermodynamic stability of magnetic skyrmions was developed by Bogdanov and coworkers \\cite{Bogdanov_89,Bogdanov_94,Bogdanov_99,Bogdanov_06, Bogdanov_11, Bogdanov_14}. The interest in skyrmion properties and potential applications strongly increased by several indirect \\cite{Muhlbauer_09} and direct \\cite{Yu_10,Yu_11,Romming_13} observations of skyrmions with different techniques in different materials. \n\nMagnetic skyrmions are attractive for use in spintronic devices because of their high mobility for low current densities \\cite{Yu_12} and \\textit{internal} stability \\cite{Kiselev_11}, \nas the relevant\tinteractions, in general, do not depend on the size and shape of the sample.\n\nRecently, Fert and coauthors presented a conceptual idea of a spintronic device based on skyrmion motion driven by spin-polarized currents \\cite{Fert_13}, similar to the racetrack memory based on the domain wall motion \\cite{Parkin_15} but much more energy efficient.\n\nSkyrmions in such a device are assumed to be stabilized on top of a ferromagnetic ground state of fixed magnetic polarization.\n\nHere, we propose an alternative scheme which involves the manipulation of an isolated skyrmion (iSk) as a data bit localized in a finite-size domain, similar to an element of Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) \\cite{MRAM}.\n\nWe demonstrate the stability of such iSk in zero magnetic field and the possibility of switching between two degenerate skyrmion states characterized by opposite polarity and topological charge ($Q$) by an inclined magnetic pulse. \n\nWe found that the switching between such states takes place via the excitation of a pair of chiral and achiral merons and the subsequent emergence of a transient intermediate achiral skyrmion. \nOur findings not only explain the microscopic details of the controlled switching process which can be achieved at GHz frequencies but also indicate the possibility of creating an MRAM type of device based on the manipulation of such skyrmion states without the necessity to apply a stabilizing magnetic field.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=17.5cm]{Fig1.pdf}\n \\caption{\\textbf{Simulation schemes and stability of chiral magnetic skyrmions at zero magnetic field: }\n(a) Schematic representation of the simulated system.

Supplementary Materials \\textbf{S2}.}\n\\label{fig_stability}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nIn our model, we consider a thin film of a chiral magnet, assuming a simple cubic lattice structure with lattice constant $a$, see Fig. 1a.\n\nDirect energy minimization of the model Hamiltonian presented in \\textbf{Method} allows one to identify the ground state of the system with respect to geometrical parameters, \\textit{e.g.} thickness of the magnetic film, and material parameters as coupling constants of Heisenberg exchange ($J$), DMI ($D$) and uniaxial anisotropy constant ($K$).\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig_stability}b shows the numerically calculated phase diagram of the ground state for an infinite magnetic film composed of three monolayers (thickness, $L = 2a$) at zero applied magnetic field, presented in terms of two reduced parameters $D/J$ and $K/J$. \n\nThe red line corresponds to the second order phase transition between a spin spiral (SS) and a saturated ferromagnetic (FM) state. \n\nThe period of the SS state goes to infinity and effectively approaches the FM state when $D/J$ or $K/J$ approaches the phase transition line.\n\nIn the case of a magnetic film of a finite thickness, the free surfaces where the magnetic atoms have a reduced number of neighbors provide an additional spatial modulation of the magnetization also through the whole film thickness \\cite{Rybakov_13,Rybakov_15}. \n\nDue to the complexity of such a three-dimensional state only numerical calculations allow an identification of the correct phase transitions.\n\nThe details of the calculation of the phase diagram and a comparison with the analytical solution for the limiting cases of pure two-dimensional and bulk chiral magnets are given in Supplementary Materials \\textbf{S1}.\n\nAccording to the micromagnetic continuum model, a solution for metastable iSks can be found for any $D/J$ and $K/J$ below the phase transition line within the FM ground state \\cite{Bogdanov_94,Bogdanov_99}.\n\nHowever, the characteristic sizes of such skyrmion solutions can be smaller than the lattice constant and, thereby, lose their physical meaning.\n\nIn order to describe the stability of magnetic skyrmions properly, it is therefore crucial to use an adequate discrete model, which allows one to identify the collapse (blue) line in Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}b.\n\nTherefore, iSks are stable only within a finite range of $D/J$ and $K/J$, given by the shaded area in the phase diagram.\n\nDue to the absence of a reference magnetic field, the two iSks with mutually inverted spin structures with opposite sign of out-of-plane magnetization (polarity) and topological charge $Q$ are degenerate, see inset in Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}b. \n\nThese metastable skyrmion states are separated by a finite energy barrier $\\Delta E_\\textrm{bar}$ defined by a priori not known complex energy landscape, Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}c, which strongly depends on the material parameters and geometry of the system.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}d, the dependence of the size of an iSk is shown for fixed values of $K/J$ marked by arrows in the phase diagram.\n\nThe size of an iSk goes to infinity when the ratio $D/J$  approaches the transition line, $D_\\textrm{t}$ and becomes very small close to the collapse line, $D_\\textrm{c}$. \n\nFor very small values of $K/J$ and $D/J$, the size of the iSk also significantly increases, see inset in Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}d, which requires gigantic size of a simulated domain \\cite{Rybakov_13, Rybakov_15}.\n\nTo investigate the generic features of switching without loss of generality we adjusted the material parameters such  that the atomistic spin-dynamics simulations can be performed on a reasonably large domain of 100$\\times$100$\\times$3 spins. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=17.5cm]{Fig2.pdf}\n

ps, damping parameter $\\alpha$ = 0.5 and 0.1 as marked on the left panel of the figure, see also open circles in Fig.~\\ref{fig_switch_diagram_alpha}. For these simulations the coupling constants have been fixed to $J = 0.5$ meV/atom, $K/J = 0.2$, $D/J = 0.24$.}\n \\label{fig_snapshots}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe have used a time dependent Gaussian magnetic field pulse $\\textbf{B}_\\textrm{p}$ applied in a direction defined by the polar angle $\\theta$ and the azimuthal angle $\\varphi$, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}a, see also \\textbf{Method}.\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots} shows the time-dependent snapshots of the switching process for different pulse widths $t_\\textrm{w}$, damping parameter $\\alpha$ and different boundary conditions: open (OBC) or periodic (PBC), see left panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}.\n\nHere and below, the origin of time is given relative to the time of maximum field pulse, $t^\\ast=t-t_\\textrm{p}$.\n\nThe initial (left) image shows an iSk with the core magnetization pointing up (red color) while the host is a ferromagnetic state with magnetization \npointing down (blue color). \n\nThe final state shown at the right most image is an almost relaxed state at 150 ps after the pulse maximum. \n\nThe initial and final states represent mutually inverted spin structures, see inset Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}b.\n\nFollowing the case of PBC, see the sequence in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}a, we explain the main mechanism of the skyrmion switching which is based on two simultaneous processes: i) an expansion of the skyrmion core and ii) a homogeneous rotation of magnetization of the surrounding ferromagnetic state.\n\nDue to the inclination of the applied field, the core of the skyrmion expands asymmetrically along the direction perpendicular to the projection of the magnetic field on the film surface, $B^{xy}_\\textrm{p}$. \nOpposite to that direction one observes the formation of a region with magnetization opposite to the expanded core, see the blue area at $t^\\ast$=-5 and 0 ps. \n\nSuch an excited state has similarity to the vortex-antivortex pair, which can be observed in magnetic vortex core reversal dynamics \\cite{Waeyenberge_06}.\n\nSubsequently, the magnetization of the surroundings keeps on turning towards the field direction together with an expansion of the core.\nWhen the surrounding magnetization is completely flipped, only the small blue region remains with opposite polarity.\n\nBelow, we show that this crescent shape object in the snapshots at $t^\\ast$ = 10 and 15 ps corresponds to a non-axisymmetric achiral skyrmion which during the relaxation converges to an axisymmetric chiral skyrmion, see $t^\\ast$ = 150 ps, with $Q$ and polarity opposite to the initial state.   \n\nIn the case of OBC, Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}b, the switching mechanism remains qualitatively the same as for the PBC, but the change in the polarity of the surrounding magnetization occurs in an inhomogeneous manner. First, one observes the appearance of an up-polarized magnetic region at the free boundary, see the red area at the bottom edge in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}b, $t^\\ast$ = 0 ps. \nIt expands and quickly propagates through the whole domain, which results in the switching of the surrounding magnetization, see $t^\\ast=10$ and 15 ps. \nFinally, the spin structure relaxes to an iSk and an additional domain may attach to the edge, see the final image in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}b.\n\nNevertheless, within a short time of about 100 ps, this domain disappears and only a single chiral skyrmion remains.\n\nIn case of realistic damping, $\\alpha \\leq$ 0.3, a strong effect of spin-wave interference is observed, see Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}c and d. \nThe spin waves injected and reflected by the free edges of the structure interfere with each other and interact with the expanded core of the skyrmion. \n\nThis may lead to the skyrmion collapse and/or nucleation of new skyrmions. \n\nThe final state may appear as a \\textit{mixed} state, composed of multiple skyrmions and domain walls, see \\textit{e.g.} the final image in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}c. \n\nHowever, a successful \\textit{one-to-one} switching can be controlled, for example by adjusting the parameters of the magnetic field pulse. \n\nFigure~\\ref{fig_snapshots}d shows how, by adjusting the pulse width, the multiple skyrmion formation is suppressed and a one-to-one switching is observed.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=17.5cm]{Fig3.pdf}\n \\caption{\n \\textbf{Time dependencies of energy contributions and topological charge during the skyrmion switching:} (a)-(c) Time dependencies corresponding to the simulation of skyrmion switching with parameters as in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}a.\nHere $M_\\textrm{x}$, $M_\\textrm{y}$, $M_\\textrm{z}$ are components of the average magnetization, $M_{\\alpha}=\\sum^N_i m^{\\alpha}_{i}/\\mu_sN$, $N$ total number of spins, $B_\\textrm{p}$ is the profile of a magnetic field pulse,\nand $Q$ is the topological charge.\n\n$E_\\textrm{DMI}$, $E_\\textrm{ani}$, $E_\\textrm{ex}$, and $E_\\textrm{Z}$ correspond to the energy contributions of DMI, anisotropy, exchange, and Zeeman energy, respectively.\n\n$E_\\textrm{tot}$ is a sum of all energy contributions, while  $E^*_\\textrm{tot}=E_\\textrm{tot}-E_\\textrm{Z}$.\n\n(d)-(g) are the snapshots of the central part of the simulated domain (top atomic layer), taken during the simulation at the time marked in (a)-(c) by vertical dotted lines d-g, respectively.\n\\label{fig_time}\n}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nReverse switching of skyrmions can be controlled by flipping the polar angle of the applied pulse with respect to the layer plane: $\\theta^\\prime=\\pi - \\theta$. \nWith that, one can achieve skyrmion switching rates of the order of a few GHz. \n\nFor instance, in our simulations the time interval between two field pulses required for sequential switching has typically a value of $200$ ps, which corresponds to a switching frequency of 5 GHz. \n\nIn the Supplementary movies, we illustrate the back and forth skyrmion switching with an interval of $200$ ps driven by a sequence of pulses with alternating polar angles $\\theta=45^\\circ$ and $\\theta^\\prime=135^\\circ$.\n\nSuch one-to-one skyrmion switching is by no means trivial: the two iSk states are metastable and the system switches between them across a complex energy landscape with various local minima and two global minima corresponding to the up and down ferromagnetic states.  \n\nIn order to understand better the general switching mechanism, we have studied the time dependence of the energy balance and the topological charge during the switching.  \n\nFigures~\\ref{fig_time}a-c show the time dependencies for the magnetization, energy contributions, $Q$, and magnetic pulse profile corresponding to the simulation presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}a.\n\nThe snapshots in Figs.~\\ref{fig_time}d-g represent the central part of the spin structure at particular moments in time which are marked as vertical dashed lines in a-c.\n\nThe time dependence of $Q$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}b shows two steps at about $t^\\ast=34$ ps and 38 ps, where $Q$ rapidly changes from $+1$ to $0$ and then from $0$ to $-1$.\n\nThe snapshots in Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}e-g illustrate the changes in the spin texture before and after these steps.\n\nTo explain and clarify this step-like behavior, we schematically show the intermediate topological states through which the system passes during the switching in Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig_4}a corresponds to the initial state and Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}b represents a pair of \\textit{chiral} and \\textit{achiral} merons (or half skyrmions) carrying an individual topological charge $Q$ = $+1/2$, while the total $Q$ of the pair remains $Q$ = $+1$.\n\nThe schematic picture of this meron pair is structurally equivalent to the state in Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}d (see also Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}a at $t^\\ast = 0$ ps).\n\nBecause of the interaction with the inclined magnetic field, in the dynamical process the core of the chiral meron is much larger than the achiral one and both have distorted shapes. \n\nThe state in Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}c represents an ideal achiral skyrmion. \n\nThe snapshot of an achiral skyrmion in our simulation is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}e (see also Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}a at $t^\\ast = 15$ ps). \t\n\n\\textit{The emergence of an achiral skyrmion via excitation of a meron pair is the key stage of the skyrmion switching mechanism}.\n\nIt reflects the tendency of the system to conserve $Q$, which in turn emphasizes the dominance of the Heisenberg exchange interactions. \n\nThe initial chiral skyrmion, meron pair and achiral skyrmion belong to the same homotopy class, all three states possess the same $Q$. \nDue to the DMI, which provides the largest energy gain for those localized states with a single chirality, achiral skyrmion is energetically unfavorable and within a short time it switches to a chiral one.\n\nIndeed, for an ideal achiral skyrmion as in Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}c, the energy contribution of the DMI equals precisely zero, while for mutually inverted chiral skyrmions as in Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}a and Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}h, the energy gain from DMI is the same because of the conserved chirality of the spin structures.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=17.0cm]{Fig4.pdf}\n \\caption{\n \\textbf{Schematic representation of the transient topological states during the skyrmion switching:}\n(a) and (h) are initial and final states of mutually inverted spin configurations corresponding to the chiral skyrmions with conserved chirality and opposite topological charge.\n(b) -

The system remains in such intermediate state only for a short time (a few picoseconds, see $Q=0$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}b). \n\nThe change in chirality on the other side of the half-switched skyrmion is also accompanied with the appearance of a SP, see Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}g, and finally results in a transition to the chiral skyrmion, see Fig.~\\ref{fig_4}h and snapshot in Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}g. \n\nSuch a transition results in the second jump of $Q$, from $Q=0$ to $-1$. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}g, we have shown the chiral skyrmion just after the switching, which converges to an ideal axisymmetric skyrmion after a full relaxation.\n\t\nThe sequence of the states sketched above explains all the details of the evolution of the energy and magnetization in Fig.~\\ref{fig_time}a-c. \n\nFor instance, the excitation of a meron pair with a large number of spins pointing in the plane rather than in the easy out-of-plane direction results in a pronounced increase of the anisotropy energy $E_{\\mathrm{ani}}$. \n\nConsequently, the chiral meron core expands which extends the inhomogeneous area and leads to a substantial lowering of the DMI energy $E_{\\mathrm{DMI}}$ as well as to an increase in the Heisenberg exchange energy $E_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. Subsequently, the formation of an achiral skyrmion and its localization leads to a lowering in $E_{\\mathrm{ani}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{ex}}$ but causes an increase in the $E_{\\mathrm{DMI}}$. \nThe following transition between achiral and chiral skyrmions involves only a small number of spins around the SP and does not affect the total energy significantly.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=9.5cm]{Fig5.pdf}\n \\caption{\\textbf{Switching diagram for square domain in terms of damping $\\alpha$ and magnetic pulse width $t_\\textrm{w}$:} Each area corresponds to the regime of excitation: breathing mode (green), skyrmion switching (red), mixed state (blue) and skyrmion collapse (white).\nOpen circles correspond to the parameters used for the simulations illustrated by the snapshots in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}.}\n \\label{fig_switch_diagram_alpha}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe precession of the spins around the applied magnetic field leads to additional excitations that affect the temporal behavior of the magnetization and energies. Such excitations become more pronounced in the case of OBC and show longer attenuation times for small damping $\\alpha$. \n\nThe influence of damping $\\alpha$ and the pulse width $t_\\textrm{w}$ on the induced dynamics is illustrated in the switching diagram presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig_switch_diagram_alpha}.  \n\nIt shows four noticeable regions corresponding to the excitation of (i) the breathing mode, (ii) the \\textit{mixed} state, (iii) the one-to-one skyrmion switching and (iv) the skyrmion collapse.\n\nFor short pulses, $t_\\textrm{w}\\lesssim 6$ ps, a skyrmion experiences only the breathing mode, \\textit{i.e.} the excitation causes a skyrmion core expansion and relaxation back to the initial state. \n\nIn this regime, the response of the system to the magnetic pulse is not strong enough to excite the meron pair state and switch the polarity of the surrounding magnetization. On the other hand, for pulses that are too long the switched skyrmion appears when the field is still too strong, which causes the skyrmion to collapse, see the white region in Fig.~\\ref{fig_switch_diagram_alpha}. For the intermediate pulse width, we observe either successful one-to-one skyrmion switching or the nucleation of a mixed state consisting of iSks and domain walls, similar to the state shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig_snapshots}c at $t^\\ast=150$~ps. \n\nThe mixed state becomes more apparent for small damping, $\\alpha<0.1$, due to the strong influence of the interference between spin waves injected by the free edges.\n\nHowever, for $\\alpha \\gtrsim~0.1$, the generation of the spin waves and their interference are significantly suppressed and this results in an enlargement of the successful switching range.\n\nWe found that the effect of spin wave interference is also suppressed in the case of a disk shape domain, even for low damping.\n\nIn Supplementary Materials \\textbf{S3}, we provide the details of the skyrmion switching in a disk-domain together with simulations for varying the values of the exchange coupling constant \\textit{J} and show how this affects the field pulse amplitude $B_\\textrm{0}$ required for successful switching. \n\nFor realistic coupling parameters we identified a wide switching range in terms of magnetic pulse amplitude $B_\\textrm{0}$ and width $t_\\textrm{w}$.\n\nWe identified the optimal polar angle $\\theta$ of the magnetic field pulse for successful switching to be in range between 35$^\\circ$ and 55$^\\circ$.  \n\nOutside this range, one may observe either the excitation of the breathing mode, the mixed state or skyrmion collapse, while the variation in the azimuthal angle $\\varphi$ does not affect significantly the switching mechanism. \n\nIn the present simulations we used $B_\\textrm{0}$ = 1 T. However, by adjusting the material parameters, in particular the anisotropy, stable switching can be obtained for lower fields $B_\\mathrm{0}\\sim 100$ mT but longer pulses $t_\\mathrm{w}\\sim 100$ ps.\n\nIn conclusion, we presented a complete phase diagram for a thin magnetic film, using a discrete model, which includes the DMI and anisotropy energies, that shows stable isolated skyrmion solutions at zero applied field. In particular, we found a collapse line for an isolated skyrmion, which defines its finite parameter-range of existence. The degeneracy of the ground state allows the existence of two skyrmion solutions with mutually inverted spin structure, opposite polarity and topological charge. We demonstrated that the switching between them can be driven by a single inclined magnetic field pulse below 100 ps. The general mechanism of the chiral skyrmions switching follows a sequence of transient topological states: a \\textit{chiral-achiral} meron pair, an \\textit{achiral} skyrmion and a \\textit{half-switched} skyrmion. The newly proposed skyrmion switching mechanism can be achieved in a wide range of material and pulse parameters and allows a repetitive skyrmion toggling, on the GHz scale, which makes these findings of interest for potential applications in MRAM-like devices. \n\n\\bigskip\n\n\\textbf{Method}\n\nThe total Hamiltonian of a thin film of chiral magnet \\cite{Rybakov_15} is given by \n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{H}  =   -\\sum_{\\Braket{i<j}} J \\,  ({\\mathbf{{n}}}_i \\cdot {\\mathbf{{n}}}_j) - \\sum_{\\Braket{i<j}}  {\\mathbf{{D}}}_{ij} \\cdot  [{\\mathbf{{n}}}_i \\times {\\mathbf{{n}}}_j ] \n - \\sum_{i}  K  ({n}^z_i  )^2  - \\sum_{i}({\\mathbf{{n}}}_i \\cdot {\\mathbf{{b}}}),       \n\\label{eq_model-Hamiltonian}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\mathcal{H}=-\\sum_{\\lx@Braket@{i&lt;j}}J\\,({\\mathbf{{n}}}_{i}\\cdot{%&#10;\\mathbf{{n}}}_{j})-\\sum_{\\lx@Braket@{i&lt;j}}{\\mathbf{{D}}}_{ij}\\cdot[{\\mathbf{{n%&#10;}}}_{i}\\times{\\mathbf{{n}}}_{j}]-\\sum_{i}K({n}^{z}_{i})^{2}-\\sum_{i}({\\mathbf{%&#10;{n}}}_{i}\\cdot{\\mathbf{{b}}}),\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u210b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mo>\u27e8</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mo>\u27e9</mo></mrow></munder></mstyle><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>J</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mo>\u27e8</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mo>\u27e9</mo></mrow></munder></mstyle><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc03</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></munder></mstyle><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msubsup><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>z</mi></msubsup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></munder></mstyle><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>\ud835\udc1b</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.08212.tex", "nexttext": "\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0pt}  \n\nwhere ${\\mathbf{{B}}}_i$ is an effective magnetic field defined by ${\\mathbf{{B}}}_i= - \\partial{{\\mathcal{H}}}/\\partial{{\\mathbf{{n}}}_i}$, $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless damping  coefficient. \n\nEq.~(\\ref{SLLG}) is solved using currently the most efficient algorithm proposed in Ref.~\\onlinecite{SIB} realized in the juSpinX code \\cite{JSpinX}.  \n\nWe used a time-dependent magnetic field pulse defined by a Gaussian function,\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 30903, "prevtext": "\n\nwhere ${\\mathbf{{n}}}_i={\\mathbf{{m}}}_i/\\mu_\\textrm{s}$ is a unit vector of the magnetic moment at lattice site $i$;  \n$J$ is the exchange coupling constant; ${\\mathbf{{D}}}_{ij}$ is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector defined as ${\\mathbf{{D}}}_{ij}=D {\\mathbf{{r}}}_{ij}$, with $D$ a scalar constant and ${\\mathbf{{r}}}_{ij}$ a unit vector pointing from site $i$ to site $j$, see Fig.~\\ref{fig_stability}a; $K$ is the out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy constant, and the last term, ${\\mathbf{{b}}}=\\mu_\\textrm{s}{\\mathbf{{B}}}$, describes the coupling of the magnetic moments to an external applied field ${\\mathbf{{B}}}$.

The $\\Delta E_\\textrm{SS}$ tends to zero when one approaches the phase transition point at about $D/J$ = 0.3695 $\\pm$ 0.0005.\n\nSuch an approach allows to identify the phase transition point for $D/J$ with a precision, which depends on the step size in $D/J$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=16.0cm]{SFig1.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{The scheme to determine the phase transition point for varying $D/J$ at fixed $K/J$:} \n(a) Energy density as a function of spin spiral (SS) period, $P_\\textrm{SS}$, numerically calculated at zero applied field for model Hamiltonian Eq.~$1$ in the main text. \nCalculations are done for a fixed ratio $K/J=0.4$, and varying values of $D/J$ close to the phase transition into the saturated ferromagnetic state.\nDoted line follows the position of the energy minimum for each $D/J$. \nIt approaches (converges to) the energy of the ferromagnetic state when $D/J$ approaches the critical value.\nThe period of SS is presented in the unit of crystal lattice parameter $a$.\n\n(b) The dependence of the SS period and the size of an isolated skyrmion on $D/J$ for a fixed $K/J = 0.4$. \nNear the phase transition point, $P_\\textrm{SS}\\rightarrow \\infty$ and $D_\\textrm{iSk}\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\n(c) The energy density for the SS state, $\\Delta E_\\textrm{SS}$, and for the isolated skyrmion state, $\\Delta E_\\textrm{iSk}$, relative to the saturated ferromagnetic state as function of $D/J$. \nThe equilibrium skyrmion size calculated in square domain of $100 \\times 100 \\times 3$ spins with periodical boundary conditions in the $xy$-plane.}\n\\label{fig_ssperiod}\n\\end{figure}\n\nOn the left side of the transition line in Fig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}b, we also show the size dependence for the metastable isolated skyrmion (iSk).\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}c, the calculated energy of an iSk with respect to the FM state illustrates the metastability of iSk, since the energy of the iSk is always higher than the energy of FM state.\n\nTo find the dependence of the energy density on the period of the SS presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}a, we performed the following calculations.\n\nWe calculated the energy of the SS state after a full relaxation on a domain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC).\n\nAs an initial configuration we used a homogeneous SS with the period defined as $P_\\textrm{SS}=N/i$, where $N$ is the size of the domain along $\\braket{110}$ and $i$ is a fixed integer number.\n\nDue to PBC, the period of the SS during the relaxation remains conserved.\n\nBy varying the size of the simulated domain, one can find the energy dependence as a function of $P_\\textrm{SS}$. \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod_images} illustrates our approach for the case $K/J=0.4$ and $D/J=0.375$.\n\nHere we assume $i=1$, the size of the domain corresponds to one SS period.\nFig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod_images}a and b show the initial homogeneous and relaxed inhomogeneous SS states, respectively.\n\nFigs.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod_images}c and d show relaxed SS for larger domains corresponding to larger SS periods.\n\nCompare the relaxed energies corresponding to Figs.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}b, c and d in this particular case, the lowest energy state is the SS state with period $P_\\textrm{SS}=\\sqrt{2}a\\cdot19=26.87a$.\n\nThe step in energy dependence on the period in such an approach is inversely proportional to the integer number of periods $i$ in the domain, $\\Delta P_\\textrm{SS}=\\sqrt{2}a/i$.\n\nHowever, for higher precision it is important to use large $i\\gtrsim 10$, when the equilibrium period of the spin spiral is incommensurate with the lattice constant $a$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=15.0cm]{SFig2.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Snapshots of SS propagating along $\\braket{110}$ of a simple cubic lattice for different characteristic domain size defined as $\\sqrt{2} \\cdot a \\cdot N$ along $\\braket{110}$:}  \n(a) Homogeneous SS used as the initial state for the following relaxation. \nTransparent spins indicate periodical boundary conditions used in the relaxation process.\n(b) Inhomogeneous SS after the relaxation of the initial state shown in a.  \n(c)-(d) Inhomogeneous SS states after the relaxation for the characteristic domain size with $N=19$ and $20$, respectively.  \n(e) Zoomed view of the inhomogeneous SS in b.

The $\\Delta E_\\textrm{SS}$ tends to zero when one approaches the phase transition point at about $D/J$ = 0.3695 $\\pm$ 0.0005.\n\nSuch an approach allows to identify the phase transition point for $D/J$ with a precision, which depends on the step size in $D/J$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=16.0cm]{SFig1.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{The scheme to determine the phase transition point for varying $D/J$ at fixed $K/J$:} \n(a) Energy density as a function of spin spiral (SS) period, $P_\\textrm{SS}$, numerically calculated at zero applied field for model Hamiltonian Eq.~$1$ in the main text. \nCalculations are done for a fixed ratio $K/J=0.4$, and varying values of $D/J$ close to the phase transition into the saturated ferromagnetic state.\nDoted line follows the position of the energy minimum for each $D/J$. \nIt approaches (converges to) the energy of the ferromagnetic state when $D/J$ approaches the critical value.\nThe period of SS is presented in the unit of crystal lattice parameter $a$.\n\n(b) The dependence of the SS period and the size of an isolated skyrmion on $D/J$ for a fixed $K/J = 0.4$. \nNear the phase transition point, $P_\\textrm{SS}\\rightarrow \\infty$ and $D_\\textrm{iSk}\\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\n(c) The energy density for the SS state, $\\Delta E_\\textrm{SS}$, and for the isolated skyrmion state, $\\Delta E_\\textrm{iSk}$, relative to the saturated ferromagnetic state as function of $D/J$. \nThe equilibrium skyrmion size calculated in square domain of $100 \\times 100 \\times 3$ spins with periodical boundary conditions in the $xy$-plane.}\n\\label{fig_ssperiod}\n\\end{figure}\n\nOn the left side of the transition line in Fig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}b, we also show the size dependence for the metastable isolated skyrmion (iSk).\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}c, the calculated energy of an iSk with respect to the FM state illustrates the metastability of iSk, since the energy of the iSk is always higher than the energy of FM state.\n\nTo find the dependence of the energy density on the period of the SS presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}a, we performed the following calculations.\n\nWe calculated the energy of the SS state after a full relaxation on a domain with periodic boundary conditions (PBC).\n\nAs an initial configuration we used a homogeneous SS with the period defined as $P_\\textrm{SS}=N/i$, where $N$ is the size of the domain along $\\braket{110}$ and $i$ is a fixed integer number.\n\nDue to PBC, the period of the SS during the relaxation remains conserved.\n\nBy varying the size of the simulated domain, one can find the energy dependence as a function of $P_\\textrm{SS}$. \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod_images} illustrates our approach for the case $K/J=0.4$ and $D/J=0.375$.\n\nHere we assume $i=1$, the size of the domain corresponds to one SS period.\nFig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod_images}a and b show the initial homogeneous and relaxed inhomogeneous SS states, respectively.\n\nFigs.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod_images}c and d show relaxed SS for larger domains corresponding to larger SS periods.\n\nCompare the relaxed energies corresponding to Figs.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod}b, c and d in this particular case, the lowest energy state is the SS state with period $P_\\textrm{SS}=\\sqrt{2}a\\cdot19=26.87a$.\n\nThe step in energy dependence on the period in such an approach is inversely proportional to the integer number of periods $i$ in the domain, $\\Delta P_\\textrm{SS}=\\sqrt{2}a/i$.\n\nHowever, for higher precision it is important to use large $i\\gtrsim 10$, when the equilibrium period of the spin spiral is incommensurate with the lattice constant $a$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=15.0cm]{SFig2.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Snapshots of SS propagating along $\\braket{110}$ of a simple cubic lattice for different characteristic domain size defined as $\\sqrt{2} \\cdot a \\cdot N$ along $\\braket{110}$:}  \n(a) Homogeneous SS used as the initial state for the following relaxation. \nTransparent spins indicate periodical boundary conditions used in the relaxation process.\n(b) Inhomogeneous SS after the relaxation of the initial state shown in a.  \n(c)-(d) Inhomogeneous SS states after the relaxation for the characteristic domain size with $N=19$ and $20$, respectively.  \n(e) Zoomed view of the inhomogeneous SS in b.

phase transition line between ferromagnetic and spin spiral states derived by Dzyaloshinskii in the frame of  micromagnetic continuum approximation \\cite{Dzyaloshinskii, Izumov84}.\n\nHowever the approach of Dzyaloshinskii ignores the effect of magnetization modulation along the thickness.\nThus, it is valid only for two limiting cases: pure two-dimensional case (single monolayer) and the bulk system where the effects of the chiral surface twist can be neglected.  \n\nRecently, this effect and the role of magnetic modulation along the thickness of the magnetic layer has been studied in the context of skyrmion stability in cubic helimagnets \\cite{Rybakov_15}.\n\nIt has been shown that such modulations are localized close to the free surfaces and sufficiently reduce the energy of the skyrmion state as well as lead to the stabilization of other earlier unknown localized magnetic states {--} \\textit{chiral bobbers}.\n\nIin both cases, the iSk and the spin spiral, we observe pronounced effects of modulations along the thickness in both cases of iSk and spin spiral.\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig_ssperiod_images}e shows the zoomed in area of the relaxed spin spiral state and illustrates the effect of chiral twist along the thickness of the layer, see small angle $\\delta$ between spins in the middle layer and spins in top and bottom layers.\n\nA similar modulation is apparent in the spin structure of iSk.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=17.0cm]{SFig3.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Phase transition of spin spiral state for different

monolayer, see $L_n=1$, open circles. \nThe discrepancy appears only for the high anisotropy case, $K/J>0.3$, see inset in Fig.~\\ref{fig_transition}a.\nThis is because in the high anisotropy case, the approximation of small angle rotation fails. \nFor any finite thickness $L_n > 1$, the transition always occurs below the transition corresponding to the single monolayer ($L_n=1$).\nIndeed, Fig.~\\ref{fig_transition}b shows an abrupt change in the transition values of $D/J$ between pure two-dimensional case, $L_n=1$ and the one of finite thicknesses, $L_n \\geq 2$.\nThe transition value of $D/J$ passes through a minima and then gradually increases.\nThe critical thickness which corresponds to the minima strongly depends on anisotropy value, see the dashed line in
