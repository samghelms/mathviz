However, for the 1-hexanol droplet with an initial radius $R_{0}=0.7$ mm, one finds $\\tau_{\\text{d}} \\approx 11$ hours, which is much longer than the 3 hours observed experimentally. In previous work \\citep{Dietrich2015} we hypothesized that this discrepancy is caused by the neglect of buoyancy driven convection of the slightly lighter alcohol-water mixture near the droplet interface. The same idea has been put forward in the context of slowly growing CO$_2$ bubbles in small supersaturations \\citep{Enriquez2014, Penas2015}, and evaporating droplets \\citep{Shahidzadeh2006}. Also in these cases, the rate of mass transport exceeded the diffusion limited predictions. On the other hand, even for mm-sized droplets, there also seem to be circumstances under which the diffusive time scale is accurate \\citep{Picknett1977, Gelderblom2011, Stauber2014, Stauber2015a}. This reflects the existence of a threshold for convection. However, the details of this threshold remain unclear. The low velocities and small refractive index differences involved often inhibit direct observation of the buoyant flow in the surrounding medium. As far as we are aware, direct visualization attempts of the external flow were only undertaken in the context of evaporating droplets, using either schlieren \\citep{KellyZion2013}, infrared spectroscopy \\citep{kelly2013vapor}, interferometry \\citep{Dehaeck2014}, and only very recently, by tracing tiny oil droplets in air \\citep{Somasundaram2015}.\n\nIn this work we combine qualitative schlieren imaging with quantitative micro-particle image velocimetry (\\si{\\micro}PIV) to directly visualize the concentration field and flow around slowly dissolving droplets of various types of long-chain alcohols in clean water. We show that above a transition solutal Rayleigh number, which corresponds to the buoyancy of the alcohol-water mixture, which is lighter than the surrounding clean water, the solute is mainly transported away in a single steady plume above the droplet. Knowledge of the flow structure allows us to derive scaling laws for both the dissolution rate and the plume velocity in the convective regime, which are in good agreement with experiments. Finally, as the droplet shrinks and its Rayleigh number drops below the transition value, a transition occurs in which convection dies out and is overtaken by diffusion.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=12cm]{Figure1.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figure1} (A) Snapshot of a dissolving long-chain alcohol droplet (1-hexanol) in water.

By increasing the number of carbon atoms in the chain from 5 (pentanol) to 8 (octanol), one decreases the solubility (and thereby the buoyant force of the water-alcohol mixture) by two orders of magnitude. This makes these alcohols very suitable to study the possible transition between diffusion and convection.\nAlcohols with purities of $\\geq98\\%$ (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. The density of the alcohol-water mixture (table \\ref{tab:matprop}) was calculated for a mixture at $100\\%$ saturation, using the molal volume $\\phi_V^0$ at infinite dilution \\citep{Hoiland1976, Romero2007}. The molal volume $\\phi_V$ gives the volume occupied by one mole of solute in the solvent. The assumption is made that $\\phi_V$ is independent of the solute concentration, which introduces a negligible error in $\\Delta\\rho$ of $<1\\%$ when compared to the direct density measurements given by \\citet{Romero2007}. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\scriptsize\n\\caption{Properties of the alcohols used in this work, measured at $25^{\\circ}$C: Chemical composition, density $\\rho$ of the pure alcohol, diffusion constant $D$ of the alcohol in water, saturation solubility $c_s$ of the alcohol in water, molal volume $\\phi_V^0$ of the alcohol in water at infinite dilution, density difference $\\Delta\\rho=\\rho_{H_2O}-\\rho_{H_2O,\\text{sat}}$ between clean water and water saturated with the alcohol, interfacial tension $\\gamma$ of the water-alcohol interface.

All measurements were conducted in a qubic glass tank of $5\\times5\\times5$ cm$^3$. The container was cleaned using isopropyl-alcohol and water, and then filled with $100$ \\si{\\milli\\litre} of clean water. This water was obtained from a Reference A+ system (Merck Millipore, at $18.2$ \\si{\\mega\\ohm\\centi\\metre}) several hours before the measurement and stored in a clean flask to equilibrate and thus reduce thermal convective currents. After the tank was filled, a single droplet was dispensed from a glass syringe with a teflon plunger, fitted in a motorized syringe pump. The droplet was placed on a hydrophobized silicon wafer $\\approx 1\\times1$ cm$^2$ (P/Boron/(100), Okmetic), placed at the bottom of the tank. Hydrophobization was achieved by coating the wafer with a self-assembled monolayer of PFDTS (1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane 97\\%, ABCR Gmbh, Karlsruhe Germany), following the procedure described earlier \\citep{Karpitschkathesis}. Prior to each experiment the samples were cleaned by insonication in acetone for $10$ \\si{\\minute} and dried under a stream of nitrogen. After the droplet was placed on the substrate, the needle was removed and the tank was closed. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Imaging}\nThe droplet was illuminated from one side using a collimated LED light source (Thorlabs, wavelength $\\lambda=625$ nm) and imaged onto a CCD camera (Pixelfly USB, PCO Germany) with a long-distance microscope providing a magnification up to $16\\times$. The images were recorded at a rate of 1 frame per second, and post-processed using a Matlab code to extract the droplet profile with sub-pixel accuracy \\citep{vandermeulen2014}. Since all droplets were smaller than the capillary length ($\\sqrt{\\gamma/ (\\rho_{H_2O}-\\rho_{alcohol}) g} \\approx2$ mm), the droplet profile could accurately be fitted to a spherical cap to obtain the radius of curvature and contact angle.\nWith this method, droplets could be traced until $V<0.05V_0$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=12cm]{Figure2.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figure2} (color online) Experimental setup, showing the glass tank (1), with the substrate and the droplet in place (not to scale). The droplet was deposited under water using a syringe (2) fitted in a motorized syringe pump (not drawn). A dichroic mirror (3) was used to couple the laser beam (4) into the long distance microscope (5). A trigger-delay box (6) synchronized the laser pulses with the camera exposure. Parts (3), (4), and (6) were used in the \\si{\\micro}PIV measurements only. The assembly used for schlieren, consisting of a positive lens (7) and a knife edge (8) located in the focal point of the lens. The parallel LED light source (9) was used in all experiments, with the exception of the PIV measurements.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Schlieren}\nThe concentration gradients developing around the dissolving droplets were qualitatively visualized using the schlieren technique \\citep{Settles2001}. For this, a positive lens and a knife edge were placed at the camera side of the tank, as shown in figure \\ref{figure2}. After passing through the tank, the parallel light from the LED source is focused onto the edge of a sharp knife placed perpendicular to the beam. To be sensitive to both horizontal and vertical concentration gradients the knife edge was placed under an angle of $45^{\\circ}$. In the resulting image, solute rich regions are visible as a local changes in light intensity.\n\n\\subsection{$\\mu$PIV measurements}\nFor the \\si{\\micro}PIV measurements the water in the tank was seeded with red-fluorescent tracer particles (Fluoro-Max, Thermo Fisher Scientific, $3$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} diameter). A pulsed green laser, (Nd:YAG, $\\lambda=532$ nm) was coupled into the microscope by a dichroic mirror. The focal plane of the microscope was centered at the droplet. Therefore, only tracer particles in the $\\approx100$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} thick focal plane were imaged, producing a 2-dimensional velocity field around the symmetry axis of the droplet. The red light ($\\lambda=612$ \\si{\\nano\\metre}) emitted by the fluorescent particles was recorded by the CCD camera at $8$ frames per second. A BNC 575 pulse/delay generator was used to synchronize the laser pulse and the camera exposure. \nThe obtained images were then post-processed in ImageJ to remove static features and to enhance the contrast. Consecutive image pairs were analyzed with JPIV, using an interrogation window of $32\\times32$ pixels, corresponding to $\\approx70\\times70$ \\si{\\micro\\metre\\squared}. The concentration of tracer particles was kept low to avoid excessive absorption and blurring by out of focus particles. Because of this low particle density, the velocity fields from multiple images pairs were combined for improved accuracy \\citep{raffel2007}. \n\n\n\\section{Visualization results}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=\\textwidth]{Figure3.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figPIV} (color online) Velocity fields (A\\&B) and solute concentration fields (C\\&D) surrounding droplets dissolving in water.

Note that panels A-C and B-D represent separate experiments. The dashed line in C indicates where the cross-sectional profiles, shown in figure \\ref{figProfiles}, are taken.

The dissolving 1-pentanol droplet generates a clear plume originating from its apex, while fresh liquid is drawn in from the sides. The tip of the plume ends in a vortex ring which moves away from the droplet as the experiment proceeds, leaving behind a single plume (see figure \\ref{figPIV}C). For 1-heptanol, with its lower solubility, the plume is far less pronounced. The particle velocities are significantly lower and the contrast of the schlieren image had to be strongly enhanced to see the plume at all (see figure \\ref{figPIV}D). The weak 1-heptanol plume seems to be affected by a small mean flow in the cell, possibly caused by thermal convection due to changes in room temperature or the illumination. As we will show later on, this mean flow seems to have little influence on the dissolution behavior. Appendix A contains additional \\si{\\micro}PIV results, including time-resolved velocity fields around a 1-pentanol droplet, the velocity field around an insoluble sessile droplet, and the flow around a dissolving sessile droplet placed on a vertical substrate. A movie, showing the motion of the bulk around the dissolving droplet, is available online as supplementary material.\n\nThe two different techniques used in figure \\ref{figPIV} reveal that the convective plume displays two different features, as illustrated in figure \\ref{figSchematic}. Firstly, the schlieren images visualize the plume shaped region that contains dissolved alcohol. The concentration profile is characterized by a width $2\\delta_c$, which increases as $\\delta_c\\propto \\sqrt{Dz/v_p}$, with $z$ the height above the droplet, and $v_p$ the plume flow speed. Secondly, the buoyant force on the (lighter) water-alcohol mixture results in a flow, as visualized by the \\si{\\micro}PIV. The velocity profile of this flow (also drawn in figure \\ref{figSchematic}) is characterized by a width $2\\delta_v$. The liquid viscosity $\\nu$ causes also the velocity profile to broaden for increasing height, namely with the same height dependence as the concentration profile, i.e. $\\delta_v\\sim\\sqrt{\\nu z/v_p}$. Therefore, the ratio $\\zeta$ between the widths of the concentration and velocity profiles is fixed, $\\zeta=\\delta_v/\\delta_c\\sim \\sqrt{\\text{Sc}}$ \\citep{Bejan1993}, where Sc is the Schmidt number $\\text{Sc}\\equiv\\nu/D$. In the current system $\\text{Sc}\\approx 1200$, so $\\delta_v\\approx 30\\delta_c$ is expected. \n\nTo obtain a theoretical description for the velocity and concentration profiles at Sc$=1200$, we solved equations (II.8) and (II.9), of the paper of \\citet{Fujii1963}, who described the analogous case of a thermal plume above a heat source. Here, we followed the numerical procedure described by \\citet{V\u00c3\u00a1zquez1996}, and used equation (II.15) from Fujii's paper as a condition in the solving procedure, to obtain the velocity and concentration profiles at Sc$=1200$, as shown in figure \\ref{figProfiles}A by the black and pink lines, respectively. \nThe lateral coordinate $\\tilde{X}$ in the theory is scaled by $\\sqrt{Lz}$, with $L=\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\nu^3/(g \\beta_c \\dot{m}_{\\text{d}})}$, where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity, $\\beta_c\\equiv\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial c}/\\rho_b$ is the solutal expansion coefficient, and $\\dot{m}_{\\text{d}}$ is the mass loss rate of the droplet. The high Sc-number in the current system results in distinct shapes for the velocity and concentration profiles. The measured value for $\\zeta$ therefore depends on the definition of the plume width, as shown in \\ref{figProfiles}A. The anticipated $\\zeta=30$ is retrieved when evaluated at a relative amplitude of $0.1$, corresponding to the $90\\%$ boundary layer definition. \n\nTo compare our measurements to the theoretical profiles, a cross sectional intensity profile was measured in the schlieren image (figure \\ref{figPIV}C) at a height of $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above the apex of the droplet (as illustrated by the dashed line in figure \\ref{figPIV}C). This intensity profile is plotted as the solid red line in figure \\ref{figProfiles}B, where we have to keep in mind that it represents the first derivative of the concentration profile, as it is the result from a schlieren measurement. To allow for an easy comparison, we plotted the theoretical concentration profile (pink solid line) from figure \\ref{figProfiles}A and its derivative (red-dashed line) in figure \\ref{figProfiles}B, and fitted the derivative to match the experiment. From this fit, a conversion factor was obtained to translate the dimensionless lateral coordinate of the theory to the length scale of the experiment. We executed the same procedure to obtain the velocity profile from the \\si{\\micro}PIV data in figure \\ref{figPIV}A, again at $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above the droplet. This profile is plotted as the black circles in figure \\ref{figProfiles}C. The theoretical velocity profile (black solid line) is superimposed on the measurement, where the previously found conversion factor was used to match the lateral coordinate. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical profiles in figure \\ref{figProfiles}C reveals that while the central part of the plume shows fair agreement with the theoretical profile, the general shape of the plume is much narrower than expected from theory. The cause of this discrepancy is not understood as of yet. Possibly the vortex, substrate, and the droplet influence the plume shape, and the expected profile can be recovered when measured at higher distance above the droplet.\n\nAs mentioned before, the plume changes over time. To visualize the evolution of the plume, cross sections are taken in the \\si{\\micro}PIV data at subsequent times, at $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above the 1-pentanol droplet. These cross sections are plotted in figure \\ref{figProfiles}D, and show that the plume properties are linked to the droplet size: both the width and the maximum velocity of the plume steadily decrease as the droplet shrinks. At $t=3000$ s, the droplet has dissolved completely.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.5\\textwidth]{Figure4.pdf}\t\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figSchematic} (color online) Sketch of a sessile droplet dissolving at a rate $\\dot{m}_{\\text{d}}$, and convective plume.

Panel C shows the velocity profile (black circles), also measured at $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above an equally sized 1-pentanol droplet, and the theoretical velocity profile (black solid line). Panel D shows the velocity profiles at subsequent times, revealing that both the plume width and velocity decrease. For clarity, the plots are vertically shifted, with the baselines $v_p=0$ given as dashed lines. At $t=3000$ s, both droplet and plume have disappeared.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Dissolution rate and plume velocity}\\label{sec:interpretation}\nThe \\si{\\micro}PIV and schlieren images show that the convective flow around small droplets takes the form of a thin boundary layer over the droplet interface, culminating in a single plume rising from its apex. A schematic drawing of this flow and the concentration profile is shown in figure \\ref{figSchematic}. If we assume (1) that at the interface of the droplet the solute concentration is constant and equal to $c_s$ and (2) that the droplet shrinks sufficiently slow. Then this situation is mathematically equivalent to the buoyant flow around a hot sphere of constant temperature $T$ and fixed radius $R$. In the context of thermal convection, the flow structure in both the boundary layer and plume are well known (see e.g. \\citet{Bejan1993}, and \\citet{Fujii1963}). In this section we recapitulate the main findings in terms of the dissolution problem and compare them directly to our observations.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Dissolution rate}\\label{sec:convection}\n\nTo study the droplet dissolution dynamics as a function of droplet liquid and size, individual droplets of varying initial volume and alcohol type were imaged throughout the dissolution process. Since the footprint radius $R_{\\text{fp}}$ shows steps due to the stick-jump mode dissolution \\citep{Zhang2015, Dietrich2015,  Lohse2015}, we define the equivalent radius $R\\equiv\\left(3V/(2\\pi)\\right)^{1/3}$ to provide a continuously decreasing measure for the droplet size. Figure \\ref{figRT} shows $R(t)$ for 1-pentanol (\\ref{figRT}A) and 1-heptanol (\\ref{figRT}B) droplets. From this, the mass loss rate $\\dot{m}_{\\text{d}}$ was extracted and plotted as a function of $R$ in figure \\ref{dmdt} for all six alcohols. Note that while $\\dot{m}<0$ for a shrinking droplet, we define the droplet mass loss rate as a positive amount, as it provides a more intuitive measure for the dissolution process. Using this, figure \\ref{dmdt} shows that the measured mass loss rates for the various droplet sizes and alcohol types span two orders of magnitude. To find a universal description for the dissolution dynamics, we continue by defining dimensionless numbers which take both the droplet size and liquid into account.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=\\textwidth]{Figure6.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figRT} (color online) Equivalent radius $R=(3V/2\\pi)^{1/3}$ as a function of time for 1-pentanol droplets (A) and 1-heptanol droplets (B) dissolving in water.

However, some oily liquids, e.g. long-chain alcohols, are slightly soluble in water (see table 1). When a droplet of such an alcohol is placed in a bath of water, it will slowly dissolve. Figure 1 shows an example of a sessile 1-hexanol droplet in water for which the dissolution time $\\tau$ was about 3 hours. Considering this long dissolution time, it may seem plausible to assume that mass transport away from the droplet is governed by diffusion. Equivalent to the diffusion driven mass transport from small gas bubbles \\citep{Epstein1950} or small sessile droplets \\citep{Popov2005, Stauber2014, Zhang2015, Lohse2015} the relevant time-scale would in this case then be given by \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\tau_{\\text{d}} =\\frac{ R_0^2 \\rho_{\\text{d}}}{2 D\\Delta c}\n\\label{difftime}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\tau_{\\text{d}}=\\frac{R_{0}^{2}\\rho_{\\text{d}}}{2D\\Delta c}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\text</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>R</mi><mn>0</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\text</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>D</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05226.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\left< {\\dot{m}_{\\text{d}}} \\right>_A$ is the actual (measured) mass transfer flux (rate per area), averaged over the droplet surface area $A$.

However, for the 1-hexanol droplet with an initial radius $R_{0}=0.7$ mm, one finds $\\tau_{\\text{d}} \\approx 11$ hours, which is much longer than the 3 hours observed experimentally. In previous work \\citep{Dietrich2015} we hypothesized that this discrepancy is caused by the neglect of buoyancy driven convection of the slightly lighter alcohol-water mixture near the droplet interface. The same idea has been put forward in the context of slowly growing CO$_2$ bubbles in small supersaturations \\citep{Enriquez2014, Penas2015}, and evaporating droplets \\citep{Shahidzadeh2006}. Also in these cases, the rate of mass transport exceeded the diffusion limited predictions. On the other hand, even for mm-sized droplets, there also seem to be circumstances under which the diffusive time scale is accurate \\citep{Picknett1977, Gelderblom2011, Stauber2014, Stauber2015a}. This reflects the existence of a threshold for convection. However, the details of this threshold remain unclear. The low velocities and small refractive index differences involved often inhibit direct observation of the buoyant flow in the surrounding medium. As far as we are aware, direct visualization attempts of the external flow were only undertaken in the context of evaporating droplets, using either schlieren \\citep{KellyZion2013}, infrared spectroscopy \\citep{kelly2013vapor}, interferometry \\citep{Dehaeck2014}, and only very recently, by tracing tiny oil droplets in air \\citep{Somasundaram2015}.\n\nIn this work we combine qualitative schlieren imaging with quantitative micro-particle image velocimetry (\\si{\\micro}PIV) to directly visualize the concentration field and flow around slowly dissolving droplets of various types of long-chain alcohols in clean water. We show that above a transition solutal Rayleigh number, which corresponds to the buoyancy of the alcohol-water mixture, which is lighter than the surrounding clean water, the solute is mainly transported away in a single steady plume above the droplet. Knowledge of the flow structure allows us to derive scaling laws for both the dissolution rate and the plume velocity in the convective regime, which are in good agreement with experiments. Finally, as the droplet shrinks and its Rayleigh number drops below the transition value, a transition occurs in which convection dies out and is overtaken by diffusion.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=12cm]{Figure1.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figure1} (A) Snapshot of a dissolving long-chain alcohol droplet (1-hexanol) in water.

By increasing the number of carbon atoms in the chain from 5 (pentanol) to 8 (octanol), one decreases the solubility (and thereby the buoyant force of the water-alcohol mixture) by two orders of magnitude. This makes these alcohols very suitable to study the possible transition between diffusion and convection.\nAlcohols with purities of $\\geq98\\%$ (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. The density of the alcohol-water mixture (table \\ref{tab:matprop}) was calculated for a mixture at $100\\%$ saturation, using the molal volume $\\phi_V^0$ at infinite dilution \\citep{Hoiland1976, Romero2007}. The molal volume $\\phi_V$ gives the volume occupied by one mole of solute in the solvent. The assumption is made that $\\phi_V$ is independent of the solute concentration, which introduces a negligible error in $\\Delta\\rho$ of $<1\\%$ when compared to the direct density measurements given by \\citet{Romero2007}. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\scriptsize\n\\caption{Properties of the alcohols used in this work, measured at $25^{\\circ}$C: Chemical composition, density $\\rho$ of the pure alcohol, diffusion constant $D$ of the alcohol in water, saturation solubility $c_s$ of the alcohol in water, molal volume $\\phi_V^0$ of the alcohol in water at infinite dilution, density difference $\\Delta\\rho=\\rho_{H_2O}-\\rho_{H_2O,\\text{sat}}$ between clean water and water saturated with the alcohol, interfacial tension $\\gamma$ of the water-alcohol interface.

All measurements were conducted in a qubic glass tank of $5\\times5\\times5$ cm$^3$. The container was cleaned using isopropyl-alcohol and water, and then filled with $100$ \\si{\\milli\\litre} of clean water. This water was obtained from a Reference A+ system (Merck Millipore, at $18.2$ \\si{\\mega\\ohm\\centi\\metre}) several hours before the measurement and stored in a clean flask to equilibrate and thus reduce thermal convective currents. After the tank was filled, a single droplet was dispensed from a glass syringe with a teflon plunger, fitted in a motorized syringe pump. The droplet was placed on a hydrophobized silicon wafer $\\approx 1\\times1$ cm$^2$ (P/Boron/(100), Okmetic), placed at the bottom of the tank. Hydrophobization was achieved by coating the wafer with a self-assembled monolayer of PFDTS (1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane 97\\%, ABCR Gmbh, Karlsruhe Germany), following the procedure described earlier \\citep{Karpitschkathesis}. Prior to each experiment the samples were cleaned by insonication in acetone for $10$ \\si{\\minute} and dried under a stream of nitrogen. After the droplet was placed on the substrate, the needle was removed and the tank was closed. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Imaging}\nThe droplet was illuminated from one side using a collimated LED light source (Thorlabs, wavelength $\\lambda=625$ nm) and imaged onto a CCD camera (Pixelfly USB, PCO Germany) with a long-distance microscope providing a magnification up to $16\\times$. The images were recorded at a rate of 1 frame per second, and post-processed using a Matlab code to extract the droplet profile with sub-pixel accuracy \\citep{vandermeulen2014}. Since all droplets were smaller than the capillary length ($\\sqrt{\\gamma/ (\\rho_{H_2O}-\\rho_{alcohol}) g} \\approx2$ mm), the droplet profile could accurately be fitted to a spherical cap to obtain the radius of curvature and contact angle.\nWith this method, droplets could be traced until $V<0.05V_0$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=12cm]{Figure2.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figure2} (color online) Experimental setup, showing the glass tank (1), with the substrate and the droplet in place (not to scale). The droplet was deposited under water using a syringe (2) fitted in a motorized syringe pump (not drawn). A dichroic mirror (3) was used to couple the laser beam (4) into the long distance microscope (5). A trigger-delay box (6) synchronized the laser pulses with the camera exposure. Parts (3), (4), and (6) were used in the \\si{\\micro}PIV measurements only. The assembly used for schlieren, consisting of a positive lens (7) and a knife edge (8) located in the focal point of the lens. The parallel LED light source (9) was used in all experiments, with the exception of the PIV measurements.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Schlieren}\nThe concentration gradients developing around the dissolving droplets were qualitatively visualized using the schlieren technique \\citep{Settles2001}. For this, a positive lens and a knife edge were placed at the camera side of the tank, as shown in figure \\ref{figure2}. After passing through the tank, the parallel light from the LED source is focused onto the edge of a sharp knife placed perpendicular to the beam. To be sensitive to both horizontal and vertical concentration gradients the knife edge was placed under an angle of $45^{\\circ}$. In the resulting image, solute rich regions are visible as a local changes in light intensity.\n\n\\subsection{$\\mu$PIV measurements}\nFor the \\si{\\micro}PIV measurements the water in the tank was seeded with red-fluorescent tracer particles (Fluoro-Max, Thermo Fisher Scientific, $3$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} diameter). A pulsed green laser, (Nd:YAG, $\\lambda=532$ nm) was coupled into the microscope by a dichroic mirror. The focal plane of the microscope was centered at the droplet. Therefore, only tracer particles in the $\\approx100$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} thick focal plane were imaged, producing a 2-dimensional velocity field around the symmetry axis of the droplet. The red light ($\\lambda=612$ \\si{\\nano\\metre}) emitted by the fluorescent particles was recorded by the CCD camera at $8$ frames per second. A BNC 575 pulse/delay generator was used to synchronize the laser pulse and the camera exposure. \nThe obtained images were then post-processed in ImageJ to remove static features and to enhance the contrast. Consecutive image pairs were analyzed with JPIV, using an interrogation window of $32\\times32$ pixels, corresponding to $\\approx70\\times70$ \\si{\\micro\\metre\\squared}. The concentration of tracer particles was kept low to avoid excessive absorption and blurring by out of focus particles. Because of this low particle density, the velocity fields from multiple images pairs were combined for improved accuracy \\citep{raffel2007}. \n\n\n\\section{Visualization results}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=\\textwidth]{Figure3.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figPIV} (color online) Velocity fields (A\\&B) and solute concentration fields (C\\&D) surrounding droplets dissolving in water.

Note that panels A-C and B-D represent separate experiments. The dashed line in C indicates where the cross-sectional profiles, shown in figure \\ref{figProfiles}, are taken. The images were taken approximately 30 seconds (A), 2 minutes (C) or 4 minutes (B\\&D) after deposition of the droplet.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure 3 shows snapshots of the \\si{\\micro}PIV and schlieren measurements for 1-pentanol (left) and 1-heptanol droplets (right). The dissolving 1-pentanol droplet generates a clear plume originating from its apex, while fresh liquid is drawn in from the sides. The tip of the plume ends in a vortex ring which moves away from the droplet as the experiment proceeds, leaving behind a single plume (see figure \\ref{figPIV}C). For 1-heptanol, with its lower solubility, the plume is far less pronounced. The particle velocities are significantly lower and the contrast of the schlieren image had to be strongly enhanced to see the plume at all (see figure \\ref{figPIV}D). The weak 1-heptanol plume seems to be affected by a small mean flow in the cell, possibly caused by thermal convection due to changes in room temperature or the illumination. As we will show later on, this mean flow seems to have little influence on the dissolution behavior. Appendix A contains additional \\si{\\micro}PIV results, including time-resolved velocity fields around a 1-pentanol droplet, the velocity field around an insoluble sessile droplet, and the flow around a dissolving sessile droplet placed on a vertical substrate. A movie, showing the motion of the bulk around the dissolving droplet, is available online as supplementary material.\n\nThe two different techniques used in figure \\ref{figPIV} reveal that the convective plume displays two different features, as illustrated in figure \\ref{figSchematic}. Firstly, the schlieren images visualize the plume shaped region that contains dissolved alcohol. The concentration profile is characterized by a width $2\\delta_c$, which increases as $\\delta_c\\propto \\sqrt{Dz/v_p}$, with $z$ the height above the droplet, and $v_p$ the plume flow speed. Secondly, the buoyant force on the (lighter) water-alcohol mixture results in a flow, as visualized by the \\si{\\micro}PIV. The velocity profile of this flow (also drawn in figure \\ref{figSchematic}) is characterized by a width $2\\delta_v$. The liquid viscosity $\\nu$ causes also the velocity profile to broaden for increasing height, namely with the same height dependence as the concentration profile, i.e. $\\delta_v\\sim\\sqrt{\\nu z/v_p}$. Therefore, the ratio $\\zeta$ between the widths of the concentration and velocity profiles is fixed, $\\zeta=\\delta_v/\\delta_c\\sim \\sqrt{\\text{Sc}}$ \\citep{Bejan1993}, where Sc is the Schmidt number $\\text{Sc}\\equiv\\nu/D$. In the current system $\\text{Sc}\\approx 1200$, so $\\delta_v\\approx 30\\delta_c$ is expected. \n\nTo obtain a theoretical description for the velocity and concentration profiles at Sc$=1200$, we solved equations (II.8) and (II.9), of the paper of \\citet{Fujii1963}, who described the analogous case of a thermal plume above a heat source. Here, we followed the numerical procedure described by \\citet{V\u00c3\u00a1zquez1996}, and used equation (II.15) from Fujii's paper as a condition in the solving procedure, to obtain the velocity and concentration profiles at Sc$=1200$, as shown in figure \\ref{figProfiles}A by the black and pink lines, respectively. \nThe lateral coordinate $\\tilde{X}$ in the theory is scaled by $\\sqrt{Lz}$, with $L=\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\nu^3/(g \\beta_c \\dot{m}_{\\text{d}})}$, where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity, $\\beta_c\\equiv\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial c}/\\rho_b$ is the solutal expansion coefficient, and $\\dot{m}_{\\text{d}}$ is the mass loss rate of the droplet. The high Sc-number in the current system results in distinct shapes for the velocity and concentration profiles. The measured value for $\\zeta$ therefore depends on the definition of the plume width, as shown in \\ref{figProfiles}A. The anticipated $\\zeta=30$ is retrieved when evaluated at a relative amplitude of $0.1$, corresponding to the $90\\%$ boundary layer definition. \n\nTo compare our measurements to the theoretical profiles, a cross sectional intensity profile was measured in the schlieren image (figure \\ref{figPIV}C) at a height of $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above the apex of the droplet (as illustrated by the dashed line in figure \\ref{figPIV}C). This intensity profile is plotted as the solid red line in figure \\ref{figProfiles}B, where we have to keep in mind that it represents the first derivative of the concentration profile, as it is the result from a schlieren measurement. To allow for an easy comparison, we plotted the theoretical concentration profile (pink solid line) from figure \\ref{figProfiles}A and its derivative (red-dashed line) in figure \\ref{figProfiles}B, and fitted the derivative to match the experiment. From this fit, a conversion factor was obtained to translate the dimensionless lateral coordinate of the theory to the length scale of the experiment. We executed the same procedure to obtain the velocity profile from the \\si{\\micro}PIV data in figure \\ref{figPIV}A, again at $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above the droplet. This profile is plotted as the black circles in figure \\ref{figProfiles}C. The theoretical velocity profile (black solid line) is superimposed on the measurement, where the previously found conversion factor was used to match the lateral coordinate. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical profiles in figure \\ref{figProfiles}C reveals that while the central part of the plume shows fair agreement with the theoretical profile, the general shape of the plume is much narrower than expected from theory. The cause of this discrepancy is not understood as of yet. Possibly the vortex, substrate, and the droplet influence the plume shape, and the expected profile can be recovered when measured at higher distance above the droplet.\n\nAs mentioned before, the plume changes over time. To visualize the evolution of the plume, cross sections are taken in the \\si{\\micro}PIV data at subsequent times, at $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above the 1-pentanol droplet. These cross sections are plotted in figure \\ref{figProfiles}D, and show that the plume properties are linked to the droplet size: both the width and the maximum velocity of the plume steadily decrease as the droplet shrinks. At $t=3000$ s, the droplet has dissolved completely.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=0.5\\textwidth]{Figure4.pdf}\t\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figSchematic} (color online) Sketch of a sessile droplet dissolving at a rate $\\dot{m}_{\\text{d}}$, and convective plume.

Panel C shows the velocity profile (black circles), also measured at $300$ \\si{\\micro\\metre} above an equally sized 1-pentanol droplet, and the theoretical velocity profile (black solid line). Panel D shows the velocity profiles at subsequent times, revealing that both the plume width and velocity decrease. For clarity, the plots are vertically shifted, with the baselines $v_p=0$ given as dashed lines. At $t=3000$ s, both droplet and plume have disappeared.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Dissolution rate and plume velocity}\\label{sec:interpretation}\nThe \\si{\\micro}PIV and schlieren images show that the convective flow around small droplets takes the form of a thin boundary layer over the droplet interface, culminating in a single plume rising from its apex. A schematic drawing of this flow and the concentration profile is shown in figure \\ref{figSchematic}. If we assume (1) that at the interface of the droplet the solute concentration is constant and equal to $c_s$ and (2) that the droplet shrinks sufficiently slow. Then this situation is mathematically equivalent to the buoyant flow around a hot sphere of constant temperature $T$ and fixed radius $R$. In the context of thermal convection, the flow structure in both the boundary layer and plume are well known (see e.g. \\citet{Bejan1993}, and \\citet{Fujii1963}). In this section we recapitulate the main findings in terms of the dissolution problem and compare them directly to our observations.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Dissolution rate}\\label{sec:convection}\n\nTo study the droplet dissolution dynamics as a function of droplet liquid and size, individual droplets of varying initial volume and alcohol type were imaged throughout the dissolution process. Since the footprint radius $R_{\\text{fp}}$ shows steps due to the stick-jump mode dissolution \\citep{Zhang2015, Dietrich2015,  Lohse2015}, we define the equivalent radius $R\\equiv\\left(3V/(2\\pi)\\right)^{1/3}$ to provide a continuously decreasing measure for the droplet size. Figure \\ref{figRT} shows $R(t)$ for 1-pentanol (\\ref{figRT}A) and 1-heptanol (\\ref{figRT}B) droplets. From this, the mass loss rate $\\dot{m}_{\\text{d}}$ was extracted and plotted as a function of $R$ in figure \\ref{dmdt} for all six alcohols. Note that while $\\dot{m}<0$ for a shrinking droplet, we define the droplet mass loss rate as a positive amount, as it provides a more intuitive measure for the dissolution process. Using this, figure \\ref{dmdt} shows that the measured mass loss rates for the various droplet sizes and alcohol types span two orders of magnitude. To find a universal description for the dissolution dynamics, we continue by defining dimensionless numbers which take both the droplet size and liquid into account.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=\\textwidth]{Figure6.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figRT} (color online) Equivalent radius $R=(3V/2\\pi)^{1/3}$ as a function of time for 1-pentanol droplets (A) and 1-heptanol droplets (B) dissolving in water. The inset in A illustrates how for each droplet with initial radius $R_{0}$, the lifetime $\\tau$ is estimated to lie between the lower estimate $\\tau_\\text{l}$ at the end of the experiment, and the upper estimate $\\tau_\\text{u}$, found by extrapolation using equation (\\ref{dVdtF}) (green dashed line).

Since the droplets could not be measured until complete dissolution, the actual value of $\\tau$ had to be estimated. Therefore, we assumed that the last stage of the dissolution process was diffusion limited and extrapolated the droplet evolution by integrating equation (\\ref{dVdtF}), using the smallest still measured droplet size of the experiment as initial value. This extrapolation (illustrated by the green dotted line in the inset of figure \\ref{figRT}A) provides the upper bound of $\\tau$, whereas the lower bound is given by the time at which the experiment was terminated. The thus obtained values for $\\tau$ are plotted as a function of $R_0$ for 1-pentanol and 1-heptanol in figures \\ref{figRT}C and \\ref{figRT}D, respectively. For larger droplets we indeed find $\\tau\\propto {R}_0^{5/4}$ as expected from equation (\\ref{tauc}), while for smaller 1-heptanol droplets $\\tau\\propto {R}_{0}^{2}$ is found, as expected for pure diffusion. The vertical line in figure \\ref{figRT}D indicates $\\text{Ra}=12$, showing that the transition from diffusive to convective dissolution occurs around $\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}$, consistent with our findings in section 4. \n\n\nNow that we have confirmed the $\\tau_{\\text{c}}\\propto R_0^{5/4}$ behavior for large droplets, we finally test whether equations (\\ref{dVdtF}) and (\\ref{convection}) provide accurate descriptions of the dissolution dynamics in the diffusive and convective regimes, respectively. Moreover, we can test whether the transition between these regimes indeed occurs around $\\text{Ra}_\\text{t}=12$, as found before. To this purpose, the curves in figures \\ref{figRT}A and \\ref{figRT}B are replotted in figures \\ref{detail}A and \\ref{detail}B as a function of the time $t-\\tau$. Figures \\ref{detail}C and \\ref{detail}D provide a close-up of the final stage of dissolution, the outlined parts of panels A and B, respectively. Along with the experimental data, we plotted the numerical integration of of the convective dissolution model, equation (\\ref{convection}), which is the upper black line in all figures. We also plotted the diffusive dissolution model, equation (\\ref{dVdtF}), represented by the lower black line in each figure. All figures show that for $\\text{Ra}\\gg\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}$, equation (\\ref{convection}) accurately captures the droplet dissolution process, reflecting convection-dominated dissolution. The value for the prefactor $a$ in equation (\\ref{convection}) was adjusted for each alcohol to obtain a good fit in the convective regime. The values used are listed in table \\ref{table2}, along with $\\theta$, for all alcohols. \nFor $\\text{Ra}\\approx\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}$, the overlap between our convective model and the experiments becomes worse, consistent with the transition from convection-dominated to diffusion-dominated dissolution.\nThe final stage of dissolution is best observed in figures \\ref{detail}C and \\ref{detail}D. When $\\text{Ra}<\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}$, the dissolution is purely diffusive, reflected by the good overlap between equation (\\ref{dVdtF}) and the measurements.

By choosing alcohols of different chain lengths, the alcohol's solubility in water can be varied by almost two orders of magnitude, while its other properties remain practically the same. This large range of solubilities allowed us to vary the convective driving parameter, the Rayleigh-number, by over six orders of magnitude, while keeping the droplets large enough to visualize their shrinkage and the flow around them.\n\nUsing a combination of \\si{\\micro}PIV and schlieren technique, we directly demonstrated that above a transition Rayleigh number $\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}\\approx12$, a buoyant flow develops around a dissolving droplet, due to the density differences between the lighter alcohol-water mixture, as compared to the heavier clean water. By modeling the observed boundary layer structure at the droplet interface and in the plume, we derived a basic scaling relation $\\text{Sh}\\sim \\text{Ra}^{1/4}$ for convective mass transport. Using this relation as a starting point, we derived expressions for the shrinkage rate of the droplet and the velocity of the plume. In the convective regime, these models are in good agreement with our data. However, once the droplet dissolves to a size close to $\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}$, diffusion gradually overtakes convective mass transport and the convective scaling relations break down.\n\nThe observed convection and associated increase in mass transport confirms earlier work on growing bubbles in supersaturated water \\citep{Enriquez2014,Penas2015}, indicating that it is a universal phenomenon.\n\nThe value for $\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}$ presented in this work provides an important indication to determine the dominant transport mechanism in droplet dissolution. In conjunction with this, the convective dissolution model allows for more accurate predictions of droplet dissolution times. The demonstrated predictability of the dissolution behavior of single, sessile droplets on a horizontal substrate, invites to test the derived scaling relations and fitting parameters in more complicated situations. For example, the applicability of the derived scaling relations and measured value for Ra$_{\\text{t}}$ could be tested in the context of bubble growth or droplet evaporation. Moreover, interesting changes in the flow profile can be expected, for example, when the orientation or the wettability of the substrate is changed. Other possible research directions include placing multiple droplets close together, to study their interaction, or making the droplets so large ($R>\\lambda_c$) that they form a puddle.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Appendix A: \\si{\\micro}PIV Data}\nThe flow structure around the dissolving droplet has been measured using micro particle image velocimetry (\\si{\\micro}PIV), utilizing the procedure and setup described above. In figure \\ref{figure1app}, the time evolution of the velocity field around a dissolving 1-pentanol droplet ($V_0=700$ nl) is shown. Shortly after deposition of the droplet (figure \\ref{figure1}A), the data reveals the presence of a toroidal vortex above the droplet, and a strong, narrow plume originating from the droplet apex. At $600$ \\si{\\second} into the dissolution process, shown in figure \\ref{figure1app}B, the center of the vortex is observed to have moved away from the droplet, causing the plume to slow down and broaden. Figure \\ref{figure1app}C shows the droplet at $2000$ \\si{\\second} after deposition: the droplet has shrunk considerably, however, a small plume is still visible, along with a small mean flow, from right to left. Close to the end of the experiment ($t=2800$ \\si{\\second}, panel D), the droplet has almost disappeared, as has the plume.

The resulting flow, shown in figure \\ref{figure3}, is found to be mainly parallel to the substrate. Liquid is replenished by inflow from the side and bottom, creating a large convection roll. The fact that the plume orients in a direction opposite to gravity, regardless the orientation of the substrate, confirms that the convection is buoyancy driven.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=12cm]{Figure13.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figure3} Velocity fields in water around a dissolving 1-pentanol droplet, sitting on a vertical wall, measured 300 s after deposition.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section*{Appendix B: Derivation of the Sherwood number in the diffusion limited case}\n\nThe Sherwood number has been defined in equation (\\ref{Sh}).

Since the droplets could not be measured until complete dissolution, the actual value of $\\tau$ had to be estimated. Therefore, we assumed that the last stage of the dissolution process was diffusion limited and extrapolated the droplet evolution by integrating equation (\\ref{dVdtF}), using the smallest still measured droplet size of the experiment as initial value. This extrapolation (illustrated by the green dotted line in the inset of figure \\ref{figRT}A) provides the upper bound of $\\tau$, whereas the lower bound is given by the time at which the experiment was terminated. The thus obtained values for $\\tau$ are plotted as a function of $R_0$ for 1-pentanol and 1-heptanol in figures \\ref{figRT}C and \\ref{figRT}D, respectively. For larger droplets we indeed find $\\tau\\propto {R}_0^{5/4}$ as expected from equation (\\ref{tauc}), while for smaller 1-heptanol droplets $\\tau\\propto {R}_{0}^{2}$ is found, as expected for pure diffusion.

Moreover, we can test whether the transition between these regimes indeed occurs around $\\text{Ra}_\\text{t}=12$, as found before.

All figures show that for $\\text{Ra}\\gg\\text{Ra}_{\\text{t}}$, equation (\\ref{convection}) accurately captures the droplet dissolution process, reflecting convection-dominated dissolution. The value for the prefactor $a$ in equation (\\ref{convection}) was adjusted for each alcohol to obtain a good fit in the convective regime.

Note that we defined the mass loss rate as a positive quantity, and dropped the minus sign from equation (\\ref{dVdtFapp}), resulting Sh$_{\\text{d}}>0$. By solving $f(\\theta)$ numerically, $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}(\\theta)$ is plotted as the black line in figure \\ref{figure6app}. When $\\theta=90$\\si{\\degree}, the droplet has the shape of a hemisphere, and $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}$ is equal to that of a free sphere, $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}=1$. When $\\theta>90$\\si{\\degree} the mass transport is reduced (as compared to that from a free sphere) and hence $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}<1$. \n\nWhen $\\theta<90$\\si{\\degree}, $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}$ decreases towards zero, which is an implication of the choice of our characteristic length scale: For practical reasons, the equivalent radius $R$ is chosen as the characteristic length scale. In the extreme case of dissolution from a flat disk, $\\theta\\rightarrow 0$, $V\\rightarrow0$, and thus $R\\rightarrow0$ resulting in $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}=0$. This does not provide a proper physical representation of the actual system, as it would result in zero mass exchange in the case of complete wetting.\n\nThen an alternative characteristic length scale is the footprint radius $R_{\\rm{\\rm{fp}}}$, in which case $\\text{Sh}_\\text{d}$ is given by the red curve in figure \\ref{figure6app}. By using $R_{\\rm{\\rm{fp}}}$ as the characteristic length scale, $\\text{Sh}_\\text{d}$ for evaporation from a flat disk with radius $R_{\\rm{fp}}$, can be calculated exactly. $f(\\theta=0)=4/\\pi$ \\citep{Stauber2014}, which gives $\\text{Sh}_\\text{d}=\\frac{4}{\\pi}$. However, the drawback of using $R_{\\rm{\\rm{fp}}}$ as the length scale appears for $\\theta>90$\\si{\\degree}. Especially when $\\theta\\rightarrow180^{\\circ}$, $R_{\\rm{\\rm{fp}}}\\rightarrow0$, resulting once again in $\\text{Sh}_\\text{d}\\rightarrow0$. \n\nSo what experimental value for $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}$ is expected? The Sherwood number scales mass exchange with respect to a diffusive, free, and spherical droplet. Hence $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}=1$ when $\\theta=90$\\si{\\degree}. Due to the substrate, the mass loss from a surface droplet with $\\theta<90$\\si{\\degree} is \\emph{larger} as compared to the mass exchange from the same segment of a free and spherical droplet \\citep{Hu2002}. The opposite is true when $\\theta>90^{\\circ}$ \\citep{Stauber2015}. Still, $\\text{Sh}_{\\text{d}}$ is always of order $1$ for practical droplets ($10^{\\circ}<\\theta<160^{\\circ}$), and independent of droplet size. The detailed dependence, as proposed in figure \\ref{figure6app} could be the subject of future work, where small droplets (ensuring $\\text{Ra}<10$) dissolve on substrates of various wettability. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[angle=0,width=12cm]{Figure14.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{figure6app} Diffusion limited Sherwood number $\\text{Sh}_\\text{d}$, as a function of the droplet contact angle $\\theta$, calculated using the equivalent radius $R$ (black curve) or the footprint radius $R_\\text{fp}$ (red curve), as characteristic length scale.
