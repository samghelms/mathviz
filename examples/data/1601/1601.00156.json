Note that no point-like sources are needed, which is consistent with the sourceless electromagnetic field of the matter sector. A local observer on one of the sides of the wormhole would measure a positive (or negative) charge, though no charges are present in the system and the net global flux is zero, which represents a explicit implementation of the \\emph{charge-without-charge} mechanism.\n\n\\item Evaluation of the total action (gravitational + electromagnetic) for these geonic solutions produce the generic result $S_T=2M_0 \\delta_1/\\delta_c c^2 \\int dt$ [with $\\delta_c$ some constant], where $M_0$ is the total mass of space-time (as given by the mass seen by an asymptotic observer) and the factor $2$ comes from the need of integrating on both sides of the wormhole. This is just the action of a point particle of mass $2M_0\\delta_1/\\delta_c$. The new gravitational effects are essential for this result, which can be seen as an implementation of the \\emph{mass-without-mass} mechanism.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nIn order for these wormholes to be traversable one first requires the absence of horizons which, according to the discussion above, depends on the values of $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ for each model. Moreover, one must guarantee its safeness, namely, that a physical observer crossing the wormhole throat is not destroyed on its transit. However, in the wormhole geometries above curvature divergences generically arise at the throat, $r=r_c$, though in some scenarios they can be completely removed for a given mass-to-charge ratio\\cite{or2}. We point out that both the existence of the bounce in the wormhole radial function, and some physical properties associated to the geon (like the energy density), are insensitive to the existence or not of curvature divergences [these are generically much milder than their GR counterparts]. Indeed, a three-fold strategy - geodesic completeness, congruence of geodesics, and scattering of waves off the wormhole - has revealed that, in the case of quadratic and Born-Infeld gravity in four dimensions, curvature divergences seem to have little impact (if any) on physical observers, who find a geodesically complete space-time no matter the behaviour of curvature invariants and where no loss of causality occurs among the constituents making up the observer\\cite{or7}. One thus concludes that physical observers are not affected by any absolutely destructive effect as they cross the wormhole throat and thus these space-times constitute explicit examples where curvature divergences do not entail space-time singularities.\n\nLet us point out that, as opposed to what happens in the GR case, the fact that we are using a standard electromagnetic field means that the energy conditions are satisfied. The generation of the wormhole structure is a genuine non-perturbative gravitational effect, since only as one gets close to the center of the solutions the wormhole modification of the point-like singularity of GR becomes manifest. The wormhole structure is robust, in the sense that it arises in different gravitational backgrounds and coupled to several kinds of matter, but disappears when the theories are formulated in the standard metric approach. In addition, these wormhole geometries might be generated in dynamical scenarios sourced by high-intensity fluxes of particles carrying mass and charge\\cite{or8} or even by large magnetic fields in the early universe\\cite{or10}, which could shed new light on the issues of topology change and the geometry of entanglement\\cite{or9}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\n\nIn summary, in Palatini theories of gravity, which are supported by the physics of crystalline structures with defects \\cite{lor}, self-gravitating, particle-like, non-singular solutions of sourceless equations generated by an electromagnetic field can be found. These classical effective geometries are able to generate a wormhole structure without any need of violation of the energy conditions, and without resorting to the standard thin-shell formalism or \\emph{engineering} constructions. Implications of such geonic solutions regarding our understanding of particles and fields are still to be seen. Since we have dealt with a simplified scenario with spherical symmetry and an electromagnetic field it is thus important to investigate if other particle properties (like color charges or spin) can be reproduced by adding other free gauge fields. In this way, geons might potentially yield an interesting phenomenology for gravitational and high-energy physics.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nWork supported by the (Spanish) projects: Ramon y Cajal, FIS2014-57387-C3-1-P, FIS2011-29813-C02-02, i-LINK0780, i-COOPB20105, and the Consolider Program CPANPHY-1205388; the (Portuguese) FCT grants No.~SFRH/BPD/102958/2014 and UID/FIS/04434/2013; and the (Brazilian) CNPq project No.301137/2014-5.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\n\\bibitem{MT} M.

The constants $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ parameterize the solutions in terms of mass, charge and length scale $l_{\\epsilon}^2$. The explicit form of the objects $\\Omega_{\\pm}(z)$ depends on the particular theory of gravity chosen, and the matter-dependent function $G(z)$ typically recovers the GR behaviour, $G(z)\\simeq -1/z$, at large distances (provided an asymptotic Coulombian behaviour), but undergoes drastic modifications around $z \\simeq 1$.\n\nThe space-times (\\ref{eq:line element}) above satisfy a number of properties:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Asymptotic flatness is obtained provided that the matter fields satisfy usual energy conditions. Slight modifications of (\\ref{eq:line element}) also allow for asymptotically (Anti-)de Sitter solution \\cite{or5b}.\n    \\item For large distances, $r(x) \\simeq x$ and the role of $x$ as the standard radial coordinate of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om space-time is restored.\n    \\item The radial coordinate $r(x)$ reaches a minimum $r=r_c$ at $x=0$ and bounces off [see Fig.\\ref{fig:1}]. On this region, large departures from the GR behaviour are found.\n    \\item The existence or not of horizons depends on the combination of parameters $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$, namely, on the charge-to-mass ratio.\n\\end{itemize}\nThis is in agreement with Visser's requirements introduced discussed above and, therefore, the space-times (\\ref{eq:line element}) represent a generalization of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution where the point-like singularity is replaced by a finite-size wormhole structure, with the surface $r=r_c$ representing its throat.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.5cm,height=5.5cm]{fig1.eps}\n\\caption{Behaviour of the radial function $r(x)$ for Born-Infeld gravity coupled to an electromagnetic field in the case $l_{\\epsilon}^2<0$ (see Ref.\\cite{or5} for details) in $D=4$ (solid), $6$ (dashed) and $10$ (dotted) space-time dimensions, as given by the expression $r^2(x)=(|x|^{D-2}+(|x|^{2(D-2)}+4r_c^{2(D-2)})^{1/2})/2$, where $r_c=\\sqrt{\\kappa q l_{\\epsilon}}$ with $\\kappa=8\\pi G$ and $q$ the electric charge.
