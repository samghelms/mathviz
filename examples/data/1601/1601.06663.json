It does not only plays a prominent role in physics \\cite{Frey2005}, chemistry \\cite{Kramers1940} and biology \\cite{Jeon2011}, but also in economics and finance \\cite{Lax2001}, as well as in vehicular traffic \\cite{Kerner2004}.  Recent developments have lead to a better understanding of the diffusive properties of increasingly complex particles,  from underdamped colloid particles  \\cite{Li2010} and  anisotropic ellipsoids \\cite{Han2006} to extended stiff filaments \\cite{Fakhri2010} and  fluidized matter \\cite{DAnna2003}. On the  other hand, the diffusion of tracer particles has become  a powerful tool to probe the properties of complex systems from turbulent fluids \\cite{Porta2001}  to living cells \\cite{Jeon2011}.\nThe hallmarks of standard Brownian diffusion \\cite{Lax2001} are (i)  a linear mean-square displacement (MSD), $\\sigma^2(t) = \\langle\\Delta x_t^2 \\rangle- \\langle \\Delta x_t\\rangle^2  \\propto 2Dt$, where   $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$  denotes the average  over many trajectories, (ii) a Gaussian step-size distribution,   a direct consequence of the central-limit theorem, and (iii) ergodic behavior in a potential, implying that ensemble and time averages are equal in the long-time limit. The ergodic property lies at the core of statistical physics and indicates that a single trajectory is representative for the ensemble. However, an increasing number of systems exhibit nonergodic features owing to slow, nonexponential relaxation. Examples include blinking quantum dots \\cite{Brokmann2002},  the motion of lipid granules \\cite{Jeon2011},  of mRNA molecules \\cite{He2008} and of receptors in living cells \\cite{Manzo2014}. These systems lie outside the range of standard statistical physics. Important questions for their understanding are  the time scale at which thermalization and ergodicity are established, as well as the microscopic mechanisms that prevent ergodicity on long time scales.\nOften in experiments only the ensemble averaged MSD is measured from which trajectory properties, such as ergodicity, cannot be determined. It has however been shown that the MSD does not unambiguously characterize the microscopic dynamics \\cite{Leptos2009,Meroz2011}. For example, non-apparent Brownian motion with a linear MSD but non-Gaussian probability distributions were observed for colloids diffusing on soft polymers \\cite{Wang2009,Wang2012}.\n Here we experimentally realize an ideal system of a single atom diffusing in a periodic potential \\cite{Risken1978}. This paradigmatic model has been extensively used to describe for instance superionic conductors, phase-locked loops and surfaces \\cite{Fulde1975,viterbi2013,Sancho2004}.\nWe demonstrate experimentally as well as theoretically that this system intrinsically exhibits Brownian properties for one-time and two-time properties, for example variance and position correlation, extracted from single-particle trajectories. The central limit theorem, in contrast, does not apply even for times much larger than all characteristic time scales in the system. This leads to deviation of the step size distribution from the Brownian case and also to nonergodic dynamics. Importantly, neither the MSD nor the position correlation function in our measurements feature any signal of such markedly different behaviour.\nFurthermore, exploiting our exceptional external control over experimental parameters we engineer the diffusion to become increasingly subdiffusive in order to follow the non-Brownian character of the dynamics.\nExperimentally, we use a single ultracold Caesium (Cs) atom trapped in a periodic potential and interacting with a near resonant light field acting as a bath. \nThis system realizes the most elementary and thus controllable diffusion process of a single particle without uncontrolled internal degrees of freedom. We use single rather than ensembles of atoms, to unambiguously identify individual particle trajectories.\nBy adjusting external properties of the laser beams interacting with the atom, such as intensity or frequency, parameters of the diffusion, e.g. the diffusion constant, damping or temperature of the bath, can be tightly controlled. \n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{Figure1.pdf}\n\\caption{(A) Series of fluorescence images  from a single atom. In the magneto optical trap the atom number is deduced (image \\#0).\nThe next 14 images are taken in the lattice and reveal the atoms position. \n(B) Schematic of the sequence. After imaging acquisition, the molasses intensity is reduced to zero and the lattice potential is adiabatically lowered to a value $U_\\mathrm{low}$ to ensue thermal classical hopping.\nOnly atoms with energies larger than the potential barrier contribute the the diffusion.\nSwitching on the molasses initiates the atom to move and the diffusion evolves for a flight time $t_\\mathrm{flight}$ between \\SI{0.1}{\\milli \\second} and \\SI{50}{\\milli \\second}.\nThe lattice potential is ramped up instantaneously for the next image process to freeze the atoms position.\nThe process is repeated after each image acquisition.\n(C) A typical set of 30 single atom traces for $t_\\mathrm{flight} = \\SI{0.1}{\\milli \\second}$.\n}\n\\label{fig:setup}\n\\end{figure}\nIn order to initialize the system, we prepare a single laser-cooled atom, thermalized with a laser light field at a temperature of $T\\approx \\SI{50}{\\micro \\K}$. We trap the particle in a periodic potential of a 1D optical lattice with depth $U_0 = k_B \\times \\SI{850}{\\micro \\K}$ and lattice spacing of $\\lambda/2 = \\SI{395}{\\nano \\m}$, where no dynamics is observed. Here $k_B$  is the Boltzmann constant and $\\lambda$ the wavelength of the lattice laser light.\nAlong the lattice axis, the atom is trapped in the nodes of the interference light field.\nTransversely the atom is confined by a \\SI{1064}{\\nano \\m} running wave dipole trap, spatially overlapped with the lattice axis. The dipole trap contributes a harmonic confinement along the lattice axis with trapping frequency $\\omega \\approx 2\\pi\\times 60\\,$Hz for atoms leaving the lattice potential, which will be important to control the character of the diffusion. Hence, the atom is confined to disc-shaped lattice wells, performing rapid in-well dynamics, but diffusion dynamics along the the lattice axis is the main process. This diffusion dynamics is initiated by, first, adiabatically lowering the depth to $U_{low} = k_B \\times \\SI{210}{\\micro \\K}$; and, second, illuminating the atom with near resonant light. \nAfter a variable interaction time $t_\\mathrm{flight}$ we freeze the atomic motion by rapidly increasing the lattice depth to $U_0$ again.\nThe atomic position is detected from high resolution fluorescence images, see Figure \\ref{fig:setup}A and \\ref{fig:setup}B, before the potential depth is lowered for a next diffusion step.\nWe stroboscopically image the same atom 14 times, and we record $600 \\ldots 1000$ of such traces for each parameter set. Importantly, taking an image involves scattering of approximately $10^6$ photons off the tightly confined atom, so that all properties of the previous diffusion step are effectively reset and no memory on, e.g., velocity or temperature can be retained. This is a requirement of a Markov process, meaning that any step of the random walk only depends on the previous one and not on the complete history of the walk.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{Figure2.pdf}\n\\caption{(A) Hopping probability versus $t_\\mathrm{flight}$ for $U_\\mathrm{low}=\\SI{210}{\\micro \\K}$ (blue circles) and \\SI{560}{\\micro \\K} (grey squares).\nThe solid lines are fits of a cumulated exponential distribution revealing the escape times of $\\tau_\\mathrm{esc} = \\SI{7}{\\milli \\s}$ and \\SI{131}{\\milli \\s}.\n(B) MSD versus $t_\\mathrm{flight}$ for a single ramping process.\nWhen $t_\\mathrm{flight}$ approaches $\\tau_\\mathrm{esc}$ the diffusion process starts.\nThe solid blue line is a double linear fit to the data points and the green solid line is the result of a numerical simulation of the Langevin equation (see SOM). The underlying single step distance distributions are shown for \\SI{0.1}{\\milli \\s} (C) and \\SI{50}{\\milli \\s} (D). \nWith increasing flight time the central limit theorem applies and the single step distribution evolves into almost a Gaussian shape. In both images the best fitting Gaussian distribution is depicted (dashed-dotted). The blue dashed line is a fit of $\\phi(L)$ (see eq. \\ref{eq:L0}) and the green solid line is again the result of the numerical simulation.}\n\\label{fig:posDist}\n\\end{figure}\nFrom the data sets, we can either extract ensemble averaged information, by centring all data sets on the first atomic position; this yields MSD values and thus standard diffusion parameters (see Figures \\ref{fig:posDist}, \\ref{fig:diffusion}).\nAlternatively, we can investigate single particle trajectories (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:setup} C) from which we can obtain information such as hopping probability (Figure \\ref{fig:posDist}A) or hopping distance (Figure \\ref{fig:posDist}C, D). We emphasize that, for investigations of ergodicity or correlation functions, it is crucial to have access to the \\textit{single} particle trajectories. \nThe intra- and inter-well dynamics of the atom in the periodic potential is precisely described by a Langevin equation (see Supplementary Material). In order to analytically describe the essential dynamics in various regimes, we use a continuous-time walk approach (CTRW)\\cite{Berkowitz2006, Nelson2001, Scher1973}.\nIt considers dynamical processes of individual particles as jump processes between lattice sites, neglecting the detailed intra-well dynamics. The waiting time at a certain position as well as the hopping distance in each time step are considered random variables with certain distributions.\nThe case we consider here realizes such a CTRW with a distribution $\\psi(\\tau_\\mathrm{w})$ of waiting times $\\tau_\\mathrm{w}$ and distribution $\\phi(L)$ of hopping distances $L$ according to\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:L0}\n\\psi(\\tau_\\mathrm{w}) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_\\mathrm{esc}}\\, e^{- \\frac{\\tau_\\mathrm{w}}{\\tau_\\mathrm{esc}}}, \\quad \\phi(L) = \\frac{1}{2 L_0}\\, e^{-\\frac{\\vert L \\vert}{L_0}},\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\psi(\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}})=\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{esc}}}\\,e^{-\\frac{%&#10;\\tau_{\\mathrm{w}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{esc}}}},\\quad\\phi(L)=\\frac{1}{2L_{0}}\\,e^{-%&#10;\\frac{|L|}{L_{0}}},\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c8</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">w</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>esc</mi></msub></mfrac></mstyle></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">w</mi></msub><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>esc</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"12.5pt\">,</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>L</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></mfrac></mstyle></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>L</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><msub><mi>L</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06663.tex", "nexttext": "\nWe measured an escape time of $\\tau_\\mathrm{esc} = \\SI{7}{\\milli \\s}$ by fitting an accumulated exponential function to the measured hopping probability (Fig. \\ref{fig:posDist}A).
