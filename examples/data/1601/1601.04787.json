We are only interested in asymptotic behavior, as\n$n\\to \\infty$, where for instance $n$ is the number of nodes, for\ngraphs, or the number of objects $\\{1,2,\\cdots,n\\}$ being permuted,\nfor permutations. For each such extremum problem we define the phase\nspace $\\Gamma\\subseteq [0,1]^2$ as the closure of the set of\nsimultaneously achievable pairs $(d_A, d_B)$ of densities of $A$ and\n$B$, asymptotically in $n$.  See Figure\n\\ref{scallop} for an example of $\\Gamma$ for graphs, and Figure\n\\ref{123-321} for an example for permutations.  (These and some other\nfigures are exaggerated to emphasize features.)\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center{\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{phase_space1je}}\n\\caption{\\label{scallop}Phase space for subgraph constraints edges and triangles}\n\\end{figure} \n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center{\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{perm6}}\n\\caption{\\label{123-321}Phase space for density constraints on the\npatterns 1\\hh2\\hh3 and 3\\hh2\\hh1}\n\\end{figure}\nIn this notation the above extremum problems 1 and 2 consist of determining\nthose graphs or permutations with density pairs on the boundary of\n$\\Gamma$. For some history of extremal graphs see \\cite{Bo}; for\npattern avoidance in permutations see \\cite{Ki}. In contrast to these\nextremum problems, in this report we will be concerned with the\n\\emph{interior} of $\\Gamma$, rather than its boundary, and not with\ndetermining those graphs or permutations with such density\nconstraints, a hopeless and uninteresting problem, but with\ndetermining what a \\emph{typical one is like} for each achievable set\nof constraints. (This is made precise in Section \\ref{SEC: background}.)  The phenomenon on which\nwe focus is that well-defined phases emerge in $\\Gamma$ as $n\\to\n\\infty$, regions in $\\Gamma$ in which typical behavior varies\nsmoothly with constraint values, separated however by sharp regional boundaries where\nsmoothness is lost (phase transitions), as indicated by dashed\ncurves in Figure \\ref{scallop-phases}.\n\nAnalysis of such phases is greatly simplified by an asymptotic\nformalism, associated with the term graphons for graphs (see \\cite{L} for\na comprehensive introduction)\nand permutons for permutations (developed in \\cite{HKMS1,HKMS2}), and by large\ndeviation theorems in those asymptotic settings, as discussed in\n\\hbox{Section \\ref{SEC: tools}.} \nThe study of phases is more advanced for\ngraphs than permutations so this status report will mostly be about\ngraphs. There are very interesting extremum results in other parts of\ncombinatorics too, for instance partially ordered sets, but we do not\nknow of work on emergent phases in those fields (see however\n\\cite{PST} and references therein).\n\\vskip.4truein\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center{\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{phase_space1kd}}\n\\caption{\\label{scallop-phases}Three phases for edge/triangle constraints}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Introduction to phases in large contrained graphs}\n\\subsection{Background}\n\\label{SEC: background}\nBefore we wade in, here is some background.\nThe formalism of phases which we discuss in Section \\ref{SEC: tools} mirrors that used in\nstatistical mechanics models, in which one analyzes configurations of $n$\nparticles in Euclidean space, with a specified potential energy\nfunction whose gradient gives the interaction forces defining the\nmodel. (For background in statistical\nmechanics see \\cite{Ru3}; there is a short outline in \\cite{Ra4}.)\nThere is a long history studying configurations of\nparticles \\emph{minimizing} the energy density for given mass\ndensity (energy ground states) \\cite{Ra1}, or \\emph{maximizing} the mass density for\ngiven energy density (densest packing) \\cite{Fej, AW}. Solid and fluid phases emerge when\nthe achievable (energy density, mass density) pairs move away from \nthe phase space boundary studied in these\nextremum problems, and this is the phenomenon we are mirroring in\ncombinatorial systems. The physics models are much more complicated than the\ncombinatorial ones due to the geometric dependence\nof the potential energy function, and indeed it is still an important open\nproblem \\cite{Br, Uh, Si} to\nprove the existence of a fluid/solid phase transition in any reasonably\nsatisfactory model (see however \\cite{BLRW}). As we will see, progress has been quicker in\nthe simpler combinatorial settings. \n\nOur goal is to analyze `typical' large combinatorial systems with\nvariable constraints, for instance a typical large graph with\nedge/triangle densities $({\\epsilon}, {\\tau})$ in the phase space of Figure\n\\ref{scallop}. Our densities are real numbers, limits of densities\nwhich are attainable in large finite systems, so we begin by softening\nthe constraints, considering graphs with $n>>1$ nodes and with\nedge/triangle densities $({\\epsilon}^\\prime,{\\tau}^\\prime)$ satisfying\n${\\epsilon}-\\delta<{\\epsilon}^\\prime<{\\epsilon}+\\delta$ and ${\\tau}-\\delta<{\\tau}^\\prime<{\\tau}+\\delta$\nfor some small $\\delta$ (which will eventually disappear.) It is easy to\nshow that the number of such constrained graphs is of the form $\\exp\n(sn^2)$, for some $s=s({\\epsilon},{\\tau},\\delta)>0$ and by a typical graph we mean\none chosen from the uniform distribution on the constrained set.\n\\vskip.2truein \n\\noindent\n{\\bf Goal.} \\emph{We wish to analyze such families of constrained, uniform distributions of large\ncombinatorial systems, in particular their dependence on the constraints.}\n\\vskip.2truein\n\\subsection{Main results for graphs}\n\\label{SUBSEC: Main}\nSpecializing to graphs, we present here the main qualitative results\non the asymptotics of constrained systems. Proofs are\nscattered throughout \\cite{RS1, RS2, RRS, KRRS1, KRRS2}, under various\nhypotheses. The phenomena have also been verified to hold under weaker\nrestrictions by careful simulations, and we postpone describing these\nissues of the range of validity until Section \\ref{SEC: graph\n  constraints}.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item For fixed constraint values, and asymptotically in $n$, the\n  nodes fall into a finite number of equivalence classes. More specifically,\nin a typical large constrained graph the set of nodes can be partitioned into a finite\n({\\it usually small}) number of subsets, with well-defined fractions\nof edges connecting nodes within, and between, such subsets. Thus\nthere are a small number of parameters describing our target\ndistributions, and they are functions of the constraints. For instance\nusing edge and triangle constraints, ${\\epsilon}$ and ${\\tau}$, for most values\nof $({\\epsilon},{\\tau})$ and asymptotically in $n$, the uniform\ndistribution has four parameters $a,b,c,d$: the node set is\npartitioned into two subsets of relative size $c$, with edges between\na fraction $a$ of node pairs in one set, $b$ for the other set, and\nfraction $d$ of node pairs split between the sets, and these are\nfunctions of $({\\epsilon},{\\tau})$.\n\\item The phase space $\\Gamma$ of achievable constraint values can be\n  partitioned into regions called phases, within which the\n  parameters of the distribution are unique and smooth functions of\n  the constraints, separated by lower dimensional boundaries on which\n  parameter values may or may not be unique, but at which they lose\n  their smoothness (phase transitions). Figure\n  \\ref{scallop-phases} exhibits three of the phases in the system with\n  edge/triangle constraints. Phase $II$ exhibits an unusual level of symmetry, between\n  {\\em classes} of nodes, rather than merely within classes.\n\\end{enumerate}\nTogether these show how the phase structure is exhibited by typical\ngraphs, through the development of levels of equivalence among nodes.\n\n\\section{The basic tools: entropy and graphons}\n\\label{SEC: tools}\n\\subsection{Graphons}\n\\label{SEC: Graphons}\nThe mathematics of asymptotically large\ngraphs uses graphons, which we now review \\cite{L}. The set of graphs, on $n$ \nnodes labelled $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, \nwill be denoted $G_n$. (Graphs are assumed simple, i.e.\\ undirected\nand without\nmultiple edges or loops.) Given $G$ in $G_n$ we use\nits adjacency matrix to represent $G$ by the function\n${q_{_G}}$ on the unit square $[0,1]^2$ with constant value 0 or 1 in each\nof the subsquares of area $1/n^2$ centered at the points $([j-1/2]/n,\n[k-1/2]/n)$. More generally, a graphon $q\\in {\\mathcal G}$ is an\narbitrary symmetric\nmeasurable function $[0,1]^2$ with values in $[0,1]$.\nInformally, $q(x,y)$ is the probability of an edge between nodes $x$\nand $y$, and so two graphons\nare called equivalent if they agree up to a \n`node rearrangement' (see \\cite{L} for details). \nTaking representatives, \nwe define the cut metric on the quotient space $\\tilde {\\mathcal G}$ of `reduced\ngraphons' by\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \n{d}(f,g)\\equiv \\sup_{S,T\\subseteq [0,1]}\\Big| \\int_{S\\times\n  T}[f(x,y)-g(x,y)]\\, dxdy\\Big|. \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{d}(f,g)\\equiv\\sup_{S,T\\subseteq[0,1]}\\Big{|}\\int_{S\\times T}[f(x,y)-g(x,y)]\\,%&#10;dxdy\\Big{|}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><munder><mo movablelimits=\"false\">sup</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow><mo>\u2286</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></munder><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">|</mo><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">|</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04787.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\noindent where the sum is over distinct nodes $\\{w,x,y,z\\}$ of $G$. \nFor large $n$ this can approximated, within $O(1/n)$, as:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 11275, "prevtext": "\n\\noindent $\\tilde {\\mathcal G}$ is compact in this topology \\cite{L}.

Our constraints\nare expressed in terms of a vector $\\alpha$ of values of a set $C$ of densities, \nand a softening agent\n$\\delta$. Denoting the cardinality by $Z_n(\\alpha,\\delta)$, it was proven\nin \\cite{RS1, RS2} that $\\lim_{\\delta\\to 0}\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\n(1/n^2)\\ln[Z_n(\\alpha,\\delta)]$ exists; it is called the constrained\nentropy $s_{\\alpha}$. From thermodynamics it is known that much can\nbe learned simply from knowing this function of the values $\\alpha$ of the\nconstraints. In statistical mechanics one focuses differently,\nusing probabilistic notions to analyze the asymptotic\nconstrained uniform distributions, again as a function of the\nconstraint values, and this is what we discuss for these combinatorial\nsettings in this report.\n\nThere are $2^{n\\choose 2}\\approx e^{kn^2}$ graphs in $G_n$.  There\nare at most $n!\\approx \\exp^{nln -n}$ graphs equivalent to any\nparticular element of $G_n$, which for large $n$ is negligible\ncompared to $e^{kn^2}$ and this fact will be relevant below.\n\nSuppose we are interested in analyzing those $G\\in G_n$ with edge density\napproximately $e_0\\in (0,0.5]$ and the largest possible triangle\ndensity, which is $(e_0)^{3/2}$ \\cite{L}. To attain this one must use $m$\nnodes to form a clique (all possible edges), where $m$ is determined\nby $2^{m\\choose 2}=2^{n\\choose 3}e_0^{3/2}$, and leave the remaining\nnodes as spectators (no connections). There are many ways to do\nthis, but they are all represented by the same reduced graphon in\n$\\tilde {\\mathcal G}^\\prime$.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we wanted the $G$'s to have edge density $e_0\\in\n(0,0.5]$ but with minimal possible triangle density, which is 0. To\nachieve this one can select two subsets $A,B$ of the nodes, and\nchoose $ne_0$ edges but only between nodes in different sets. There\nare many inequivalent bipartite graphs of this type (except for\n$e_0=0.5$), so a more productive goal might be to get a useful\nhandle on the distribution of solutions $G$.\n\nFinally, there is an enormous number of ways to attain edge density $e_0\\in (0.5]$ and\ntriangle density fixed between the maximum and minimum just\ndiscussed. For these intermediate cases\nwe change the problem as suggested in the previous paragraph; we\nno longer try to identify the appropriate graphs, but it turns out\nwe can often identify what a typical such graph is like, i.e.\\\ndetermine the (uniform) distribution on such constrained graphs.\nFor instance for triangle density $\\tau\\in [0,e_0^3]$ the constrained\ndistribution is obtained by partitioning the node set into two equal\nsets $A$ and $B$, and choosing edges between node pairs independently\nby the following two rules: for any two nodes in the same set the\nprobability of an edge is $[e_0-(e_0^3-\\tau)^{1/3}]$,\nand for any two nodes in different sets the probability is $[e_0\n  +(e_0^3-t)^{1/3}]$.

Our constraints\nare expressed in terms of a vector $\\alpha$ of values of a set $C$ of densities, \nand a softening agent\n$\\delta$. Denoting the cardinality by $Z_n(\\alpha,\\delta)$, it was proven\nin \\cite{RS1, RS2} that $\\lim_{\\delta\\to 0}\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\n(1/n^2)\\ln[Z_n(\\alpha,\\delta)]$ exists; it is called the constrained\nentropy $s_{\\alpha}$. From thermodynamics it is known that much can\nbe learned simply from knowing this function of the values $\\alpha$ of the\nconstraints. In statistical mechanics one focuses differently,\nusing probabilistic notions to analyze the asymptotic\nconstrained uniform distributions, again as a function of the\nconstraint values, and this is what we discuss for these combinatorial\nsettings in this report.\n\nThere are $2^{n\\choose 2}\\approx e^{kn^2}$ graphs in $G_n$.  There\nare at most $n!\\approx \\exp^{nln -n}$ graphs equivalent to any\nparticular element of $G_n$, which for large $n$ is negligible\ncompared to $e^{kn^2}$ and this fact will be relevant below.\n\nSuppose we are interested in analyzing those $G\\in G_n$ with edge density\napproximately $e_0\\in (0,0.5]$ and the largest possible triangle\ndensity, which is $(e_0)^{3/2}$ \\cite{L}. To attain this one must use $m$\nnodes to form a clique (all possible edges), where $m$ is determined\nby $2^{m\\choose 2}=2^{n\\choose 3}e_0^{3/2}$, and leave the remaining\nnodes as spectators (no connections). There are many ways to do\nthis, but they are all represented by the same reduced graphon in\n$\\tilde {\\mathcal G}^\\prime$.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we wanted the $G$'s to have edge density $e_0\\in\n(0,0.5]$ but with minimal possible triangle density, which is 0. To\nachieve this one can select two subsets $A,B$ of the nodes, and\nchoose $ne_0$ edges but only between nodes in different sets. There\nare many inequivalent bipartite graphs of this type (except for\n$e_0=0.5$), so a more productive goal might be to get a useful\nhandle on the distribution of solutions $G$.\n\nFinally, there is an enormous number of ways to attain edge density $e_0\\in (0.5]$ and\ntriangle density fixed between the maximum and minimum just\ndiscussed. For these intermediate cases\nwe change the problem as suggested in the previous paragraph; we\nno longer try to identify the appropriate graphs, but it turns out\nwe can often identify what a typical such graph is like, i.e.\\\ndetermine the (uniform) distribution on such constrained graphs.\nFor instance for triangle density $\\tau\\in [0,e_0^3]$ the constrained\ndistribution is obtained by partitioning the node set into two equal\nsets $A$ and $B$, and choosing edges between node pairs independently\nby the following two rules: for any two nodes in the same set the\nprobability of an edge is $[e_0-(e_0^3-\\tau)^{1/3}]$,\nand for any two nodes in different sets the probability is $[e_0\n  +(e_0^3-t)^{1/3}]$. For $\\tau=e_0^3$ this reduces to the situation\nin which each pair of nodes is connected with probability $e_0$, while\nfor\n$\\tau=0$ it reduces to the extreme case discussed above.\n\n\nThis is the point where the mathematics changes\nflavor. This is not due merely to our focus on asymptotics; as noted in Section\n\\ref{SEC:Intro}, the\nextremal combinatorics associated with the boundary of the phase space\nalready involves asymptotics, and for instance led to the beautiful\nflag algebra formalism of Razborov \\cite{R3}. The difference here is\nthat at points in the interior of $\\Gamma$, where we want to\nunderstand not individual graphs but the constrained uniform\ndistribution on graphs, our problem is naturally reformulated\nwithin the {\\em calculus of variations}, since a key tool is the \nconstrained entropy\n$s_\\alpha$ which can be represented as follows.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:g-variation}\n(The variational principle for constrained \ngraphs \\cite{RS1,RS2})\n{For any vector $\\bar H$ of subgraphs $H_j$ and vector $\\alpha$ of\n  numbers $\\bar \\alpha_j$,\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\label{var}\ns_\\alpha=\\max_{t_H(q)=\\alpha} S(q),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"s_{\\alpha}=\\max_{t_{H}(q)=\\alpha}S(q),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><munder><mi>max</mi><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>H</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></munder><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04787.tex", "nexttext": "\n\\end{theorem}\nOur goal is to understand families of constrained uniform\ndistributions on graphs in $G_n$, $n$ large.

To preserve continuity of argument we will\nclarify some statements with references to the Notes at the end of the\ntext.\n\n\\subsection{Edge/triangle model}\n\\label{SEC: e/t model}\nConsider first the edge/triangle model, using edge/triangle densities\n$({\\epsilon},{\\tau})$ as constraints, studied in\n\\cite{RS1,RS2,RRS,KRRS1,KRRS2}. The entropy optimizer is unique$^{(1)}$ in\n$\\tilde {\\mathcal G}$ for\nevery pair $({\\epsilon},{\\tau})$. Also, the optimizer\nis multipodal, i.e.\\ there is a partition of\n$[0,1]$ into finitely many subsets $F_j$ and the graphon is constant\non each product $F_j\\times F_k$. This gives a distribution with finitely many parameters, which vary\nsmoothly with $({\\epsilon},{\\tau})$ except on certain curves, separating\nphases$^{(2)}$. Specifically, for over $95\\%$ of the area of\n$\\Gamma$, corresponding to constraints in the phases $I,\\ II$ and\n$III$ in Figure \\ref{scallop-phases}, it is bipodal -- the partition of the nodes is into\njust two subsets -- so there are only four parameters in the asymptotic\ndistribution, each a function of the constraints. \nIn particular, in\nphase $II$ there is a very interesting symmetry: the two {\\em sets} of nodes are in all ways\ninterchangeable. This means, in terms of the parameters defined earlier,\nthat $a=b$ and $c=1$, so there are only two independent variables,\n$a$ and $d$, in this phase. One can then solve for $a$ and $b$ in\nterms of the constraints ${\\epsilon}$ and ${\\tau}$, getting the graphon in Figure\n\\ref{graphon} (using convenient node labelling). \n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center{\\includegraphics[width=3in]{bipartite3a}}\n\\caption{\\label{graphon}The (piecewise constant) edge/triangle graphon in phase $II$}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center{\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{phase_diagram2c}}\n\\caption{\\label{2-star}The phase space for the 2-star model}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center{\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{phase_diagram2b}}\n\\caption{\\label{critical}The critical point in the 2-star model}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIt is natural to study the boundaries of phases, to see how the system\nchanges there. Consider the approach to the phase boundary ${\\tau}={\\epsilon}^3$, from each\nside. Fixing ${\\epsilon} \\le 0.5$ and increasing ${\\tau}$ from 0, we see from\nFigure \\ref{graphon} that the large typical graph starts as perfectly symmetric\nbipartite, and steadily loses the distinction between the two sets$^{(3)}$. At\n${\\tau}={\\epsilon}^3$ the nodes are all equivalent; these are the\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, with iid edges, and since the constrained\nentropy peaks  at the curve ${\\tau}={\\epsilon}^3$ when varying either ${\\epsilon}$ or ${\\tau}$\nseparately, these graphs are important in part because of their overwhelming\nnumber. They also play the same intuitive role for us as the ideal gas\nin statistical mechanics.\n\nThe approach to the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi curve from phase $I$ is quite\ndifferent. Except at ${\\epsilon}=0.5$ (the maximum of the unconstrained\nentropy), as one increases ${\\tau}$ from ${\\epsilon}^3$ the optimal graphon\nimmediately becomes bipodal but now by the emergence of an\ninfinitesmal set of nodes: $c=O({\\tau}-{\\epsilon}^3)$. The asymptotic form of\n$a,b$ and $d$ are proven in \\cite{KRRS2}. The behavior of phase $I$ near its upper\nboundary, ${\\tau}={\\epsilon}^{3/2}$ has not been analyzed. But on the upper\nboundary itself the optimal graphon consists of spectator nodes, fully\nunconnected, and a cluster of fully interconnected nodes (a clique),\nof size needed to produce edge density ${\\epsilon}$. It is not yet understood\nhow these graphs connect to the ones emerging from the lower boundary\nof phase $I$, though extensive simulation data has been gathered \\cite{RRS}. And\nfinally, perturbation about the boundary between phases $III$ and $II$ is\nparticularly interesting because of the breaking of symmetry.\nNew features appear in other models, which we now discuss. \n\n\\subsection{$k$-star graph models}\nA $k$-star is a graph with $k$ edges with a node in common, and the\n\\hbox{$k$-star model} is the one in which the constraints are the\ndensity ${\\epsilon}$ of edges and the density ${\\tau}_k$ of $k$-stars. The phase\nspace $\\Gamma$ of the 2-star model is typical of them, and shown in\nFigure \\ref{2-star} \\cite{KRRS1}$^{(4)}$. For any $k$-star model the\nlower boundary of $\\Gamma$ is the curve, ${\\tau}_k={\\epsilon}^k$, represented by\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (constant) graphons, and the upper boundary is the\nupper envelop of two intersecting smooth curves$^{(4)}$. There is a\nunique bipodal graphon representing all but one point on the upper\nboundary, the intersection point just noted, where the two one-sided\ngraphon limits differ$^{(4)}$. We know for $k$-star models that in the\ninterior of $\\Gamma$ there is a unique entropy-optimizing bipodal\ngraphon everywhere except on a curve emanating from the intersection\npoint on the boundary; this curve ends at a `critical point' in the\ninterior of $\\Gamma$, so there is only one phase in each of these\nmodels$^{(5)}$. See Figure \\ref{critical}. The behavior of $k$-star\nmodels just above the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi curve is common to many\nother models, including the edge/triangle model \\cite{KRRS2}. However\nthis universality does not extend further from the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\ncurve; in particular there is no transition in the edge/triangle model\nanalogous to that in the $k$-star models$^{(6)}$. (There is some\nconfusion on this point coming from exponential random graph\nmodels$^{(7)}$.)\n\n\\subsection{Half-blip model}\\label{SUBSEC: half-blip}\nFinally we consider the half-blip model, where the constraints are\na pair of signed densities, the signed 2-star density $t_1$ and signed\nsquare \\hbox{density $t_2$,} defined for graphons by:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17433, "prevtext": "\n\\noindent  where\n$S$ is the Shannon entropy of graphons:}\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\label{Shannon}\nS(q)=-\\int_{[0,1]^2} \\frac{1}{2}\\{q(x,y)\\ln[q(x,y)]+[1-q(x,y)]\\ln[1-q(x,y)]\\}\\,dxdy.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S(q)=-\\int_{[0,1]^{2}}\\frac{1}{2}\\{q(x,y)\\ln[q(x,y)]+[1-q(x,y)]\\ln[1-q(x,y)]\\}%&#10;\\,dxdy.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></msub><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04787.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 26526, "prevtext": "\n\\end{theorem}\nOur goal is to understand families of constrained uniform\ndistributions on graphs in $G_n$, $n$ large.

Except at ${\\epsilon}=0.5$ (the maximum of the unconstrained\nentropy), as one increases ${\\tau}$ from ${\\epsilon}^3$ the optimal graphon\nimmediately becomes bipodal but now by the emergence of an\ninfinitesmal set of nodes: $c=O({\\tau}-{\\epsilon}^3)$. The asymptotic form of\n$a,b$ and $d$ are proven in \\cite{KRRS2}. The behavior of phase $I$ near its upper\nboundary, ${\\tau}={\\epsilon}^{3/2}$ has not been analyzed. But on the upper\nboundary itself the optimal graphon consists of spectator nodes, fully\nunconnected, and a cluster of fully interconnected nodes (a clique),\nof size needed to produce edge density ${\\epsilon}$. It is not yet understood\nhow these graphs connect to the ones emerging from the lower boundary\nof phase $I$, though extensive simulation data has been gathered \\cite{RRS}. And\nfinally, perturbation about the boundary between phases $III$ and $II$ is\nparticularly interesting because of the breaking of symmetry.\nNew features appear in other models, which we now discuss. \n\n\\subsection{$k$-star graph models}\nA $k$-star is a graph with $k$ edges with a node in common, and the\n\\hbox{$k$-star model} is the one in which the constraints are the\ndensity ${\\epsilon}$ of edges and the density ${\\tau}_k$ of $k$-stars. The phase\nspace $\\Gamma$ of the 2-star model is typical of them, and shown in\nFigure \\ref{2-star} \\cite{KRRS1}$^{(4)}$. For any $k$-star model the\nlower boundary of $\\Gamma$ is the curve, ${\\tau}_k={\\epsilon}^k$, represented by\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (constant) graphons, and the upper boundary is the\nupper envelop of two intersecting smooth curves$^{(4)}$. There is a\nunique bipodal graphon representing all but one point on the upper\nboundary, the intersection point just noted, where the two one-sided\ngraphon limits differ$^{(4)}$. We know for $k$-star models that in the\ninterior of $\\Gamma$ there is a unique entropy-optimizing bipodal\ngraphon everywhere except on a curve emanating from the intersection\npoint on the boundary; this curve ends at a `critical point' in the\ninterior of $\\Gamma$, so there is only one phase in each of these\nmodels$^{(5)}$. See Figure \\ref{critical}. The behavior of $k$-star\nmodels just above the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi curve is common to many\nother models, including the edge/triangle model \\cite{KRRS2}. However\nthis universality does not extend further from the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\ncurve; in particular there is no transition in the edge/triangle model\nanalogous to that in the $k$-star models$^{(6)}$. (There is some\nconfusion on this point coming from exponential random graph\nmodels$^{(7)}$.)\n\n\\subsection{Half-blip model}\\label{SUBSEC: half-blip}\nFinally we consider the half-blip model, where the constraints are\na pair of signed densities, the signed 2-star density $t_1$ and signed\nsquare \\hbox{density $t_2$,} defined for graphons by:\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation} \nt_1(q)= \\int q(x,y) [1-q(y,z)] dx\\, dy\\, dz ;\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"t_{1}(q)=\\int q(x,y)[1-q(y,z)]dx\\,dy\\,dz;\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>x</mi></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>y</mi></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>;</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04787.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\noindent The phase space for this model is not fully known, but there is a\nlower edge corresponding to $t_2=0$, namely $\\{(t_1,0)\\,|\\, 0\\le\nt_1\\le 1/6\\}$, with the following feature: as $t_1$ increases from 0\nthe unique representing graphon is $m$-podal but with $m\\to\\infty$ as\n$t_1\\to 1/6$.

Note that $H$ is 0 on the uniform permuton (where\n$g(x,y) \\equiv 1$) and negative (sometimes $-\\infty$) on all other\npermutons, since the function $-z \\ln z$ is concave downward.  If\n$\\gamma$ has no probability density we define $H(\\gamma) = -\\infty$.\n\nFix some finite set $\\{\\tau_1,\\dots,\\tau_k\\}$ of patterns\nand let $\\alpha = (\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_k)$ be a vector of their target\ndensities. We then define two sets of permutons:\n\n", "index": 25, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Lambda^{\\alpha,\\delta}=\\{\\gamma\\in {\\mathbb{M}}\\,|\\, |\\rho_{\\tau_j}(\\gamma)\n- \\alpha_j| < \\delta \\hbox{ for each }1 \\le j \\le k\\},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E13.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Lambda^{\\alpha,\\delta}=\\{\\gamma\\in{\\mathbb{M}}\\,|\\,|\\rho_{\\tau_{j}}(\\gamma)-%&#10;\\alpha_{j}|&lt;\\delta\\hbox{ for each }1\\leq j\\leq k\\},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03b4</mi></mrow></msup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>\ud835\udd44</mi></mpadded></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>\u00a0for each\u00a0</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mi>j</mi><mo>\u2264</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04787.tex", "nexttext": "\nWith that notation, and the understanding that\n$\\Lambda_n^{\\alpha,\\delta} = \\Lambda^{\\alpha,\\delta} \\cap\n\\gamma(S_n)$, where $\\gamma(\\pi)=\\gamma_\\pi$, we have:\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:p-variation}\n(The variational principle for constrained \npermutations \\cite{KKRW})\n{\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 33029, "prevtext": "\n\n\n", "index": 27, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Lambda^{\\alpha}=\\{\\gamma\\in {\\mathbb{M}}\\,|\\, \\rho_{\\pi_j}(\\gamma) = \\alpha_j \n\\hbox{ for each }1 \\le j \\le k\\}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E14.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Lambda^{\\alpha}=\\{\\gamma\\in{\\mathbb{M}}\\,|\\,\\rho_{\\pi_{j}}(\\gamma)=\\alpha_{j}%&#10;\\hbox{ for each }1\\leq j\\leq k\\}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>\ud835\udd44</mi></mpadded></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><msub><mi>\u03c0</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b1</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>\u00a0for each\u00a0</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mi>j</mi><mo>\u2264</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04787.tex", "nexttext": "}\n\\end{theorem}\nConstrained sets of permutations in $S_n$ have cardinality of\norder $\\displaystyle e^{n \\ln n +(c-n)}$ where $c \\in [-\\infty,0]$ is\nour target \\cite{KKRW}.\nThe function of $\\alpha$, $\\displaystyle \\max_{\\gamma \\in \\Lambda^{\\alpha}} H(\\gamma)$, which is\nguaranteed by the theorem to exist but may be $-\\infty$, is the \n\\emph{constrained entropy} and denoted by $s(\\alpha)$. Theorem \\ref{thm:p-variation} was proven\nin \\cite{KKRW} using the large deviations theorem from \\cite{Tr}.\n\n\\subsection{Examples ofconstrained large permutations}\nThe general framework for the asymptotics of constrained permutations\nis thus analogous to that of constrained graphs. In detail the mathematics\nis quite different, but in terms of results about phase structure \nthe main difference is in the depth of progress on\nexamples, even on the boundary of their phase spaces, i.e. the extremal\ntheory. The main examples in which relevant progress has been made concerning\nphases in constrained permutations are:\nthe 1\\hh2/1\\hh2\\hh3 model, star models, and the 1\\hh2\\hh3/3\\hh2\\hh1 model.\n\nFor the 1\\hh2/1\\hh2\\hh3 model it has been shown \\cite{KKRW} that the phase space\nis the same scalloped triangle which is the phase space for\nthe edge/triangle of graphs \\hbox{Figure \\ref{scallop}.} For graphs the vertices of the\nscalloped triangle were shown to give rise to interesting phases and\nphase transitions, as indicated in \\hbox{Figure \\ref{scallop-phases}.} However there is no evidence\nyet of an analogous phenomenon for the \\hbox{1\\hh2/1\\hh2\\hh3} model of permutations.\n\nStar models of permutations use constraints of slightly different\ncharacter than considered so far. Instead of a single pattern $\\tau\\in\nS_k$ say, one replaces two or more of the symbols in $\\tau$ by a $*$,\nwhich is a place holder which can be filled by any unused symbols.\nFor instance the constraint $*2*$ fixes the density of the union of\nall consistent patterns in $S_3$, namely 1\\hh2\\hh3 and 3\\hh2\\hh1. For a class of\nmodels with a finite number of such constraints it is proven that\nconstrained entropy is an analytic function of the constraint values,\nand that it has a unique optimal permuton at each point in its phase\nspace \\cite{KKRW}. \n\nFinally, for the 1\\hh2\\hh3/3\\hh2\\hh1 model there is proven \\cite{KKRW}\nto be a phase\ntransition on a curve emanating from the singularity at\n$(0.278\\ldots,0.278\\ldots)$ on its phase boundary (see Figure \\ref{123-321}), of\nsimilar character to the one proven for the \\hbox{edge/2-star} graph model\n(see Figure \\ref{2-star}).\n\nWe conclude our discussion of the permutation theory by noting two\ntopics in the asymptotics of constrained permutations which were\nomitted due to a lack of results on phase structure. One is the\nuseful tool of insertion measures; see \\cite{KKRW}. And finally, we\nhave ignored work done with a single constraint because, as was noted\nin Section \\ref{SUBSEC: half-blip} for graphs, it does not seem to bear on the deeper issues of\nphases and phase transitions; however see \\cite{SW} and references\ntherein.\n\n\\section{Open problems}\n\nTwo open problems for constrained graphs go to the heart of our\nunderstanding of phase emergence. The first is to understand why, in\nall models we have studied, there is a unique optimizer for the\nconstrained entropy except off a set of constraints of lower\ndimension. As noted in Section \\ref{SEC: entropy for graphs}, without\nthis feature our method would not produce useful results. There is\nsome analysis of this phenomenon in statistical mechanics, but the\nonly results are uniqueness off a set of constraint values of category\none, or of measure zero \\cite{Ru2,I}, and while intuitively\nsuggestive this is not of practical use.\n\nAnother basic problem is the origin of the multipodal structure of\nentropy optimizers. We have never found a nonmultipodal entropy\noptimizer in the interior of a phase space, i.e.\\ in a phase, but\nthere is no general proof that they cannot exist. (There are proofs in\nsome regions of some models \\cite{KRRS1,KRRS2}, \nbut they do not give any insight into the general situation.) An obvious candidate\nfor exploring this is the half-blip model of Section \\ref{SUBSEC:\n  half-blip}, a model which had already been used to study the\nanalogous phenomenon in extremal graph theory \\cite{LS}.\n\nMultipodality can be understood in terms of a symmetry between nodes,\nas discussed in Section \\ref{SUBSEC: Main}.  Another, and related, open\nproblem concerns phase $II$ in the edge/triangle\nmodel. The symmetry of this phase, discussed in Section \\ref{SEC: e/t\n  model}, is between the equivalence classes that define multipodal\nstructure. What is the significance of this higher level of symmetry?\nMultipodal graphons are piecewise constant as functions on $[0,1]^2$,\nand it is plausible that such uniformity originates from\nmaximizing entropy, as was actually demonstrated in \\cite{KRRS1} for $k$-star models.\n But the higher level of symmetry of phase $II$ in the edge/triangle\n model is\nin a different category. One possible path to understanding this\nlinks the problem  to an old open problem in statistical physics, to understand\nwhy there is not a critical point in the transition between solid and\nfluid phases of matter as there is between liquid and gas; see Figure\n\\ref{PT diagram}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center{\\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{ptnewa}}\n\\caption{\\label{PT diagram}The phase diagram of a simple material}\n\\end{figure}\n\nConsider the traditional symmetry argument from physics \\cite{An}:\n\\vskip.1truein \\noindent\n``It was Landau (Landau and Lifshitz, 1958) who, long ago, first pointed\nout the vital importance of symmetry in phase transitions. This, the\nFirst Theorem of solid-state physics, can be stated very simply: it is\nimpossible to change symmetry gradually. A given symmetry element is\neither there or it is not; there is no way for it to grow\nimperceptibly. This means, for instance, that there can be no critical\npoint for the melting curve as there is for the boiling point: it will\nnever be possible to go continuously through some high-pressure phase\nfrom liquid to solid.''\n\\vskip.1truein \nThis argument is not completely convincing \\cite{Pi}, but the role of\nsymmetry in the study of solids is pervasive and has been highly\nproductive both in science and mathematics. And in support for linking \nthe problems we note there is no critical\npoint in the transition between phases $II$ and $III$ in Figure\n\\ref{scallop-phases} where the graphons for phase $II$ but not $III$ have the higher\nsymmetry, while there is a critical point in Figure\n\\ref{critical}, where the graphons do not exhibit the higher level symmetry.\n\nConcerning permutations we note that the permuton machinery seems to\napply well to pattern constraints. But this leaves out a major aspect\nof permutations, their cycle structure, which makes use of permutation\nmultiplication and avoids the linear structure used in\npatterns. Incorporating cycle structure should be a major source of development.\n\n\\vfill \\eject\n{\\centerline{\\bf Notes}}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item This has been proven in a thin region above the\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi curve \\cite{KRRS2} and on the line $\\{({\\epsilon},{\\tau})\\,|\\,{\\epsilon}=0.5,\\\n0\\le {\\tau}\\le 1/8\\}$ \\cite{RS1}, and seen in all the extensive simulations of the\nmodel noted in \\cite{RRS}.\n\n\\item Bipodality is proven in a thin region above the\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi curve  \\cite{KRRS2} and on the line segment $\\{({\\epsilon},{\\tau})\\,|\\,{\\epsilon}=0.5,\\\n0\\le {\\tau}\\le 1/8\\}$ \\cite{RS1}. Bipodality and tripodality has been seen in all\nother regions simulated in \\cite{RRS}. There are expected to be regions of\n$m$-podality with increasing $m$ near the corners of the scallops\nalong the boundary of the phase space \\cite{RS1,RS2}. The rest of the claims\nabout entropy optimizers in this paragraph are only known from the\nsimulations referenced.\n\n\\item The bipodal graphon in Figure \\ref{graphon} is only proven along the\nline segment $\\{({\\epsilon},{\\tau})\\,|\\,{\\epsilon}=0.5,\\ 0\\le {\\tau}\\le 1/8\\}$ \\cite{RS1}, but has been\nthoroughly investigated by simulation \\cite{RRS} in the region described as\nphase $II$.\n\n\\item The phase diagrams for $k$-star models are derived, but only for $k\\le 30$, \nin \\cite{KRRS1}.\n\n\\item The one phase is smooth except on the curve. Nonsmoothness on\n  the curve has been\n  proven for $k=2$, and seen in simulation in $k=3$, in \\cite{KRRS1}.\n\n\\item This is only known from simulation, but would not be\nexpected because of the behavior of the edge/triangle model on the\nupper boundary of its phase space.\n\n\\item Exponential random graph models are widely used, especially\nin the social sciences, to model graphs on a fixed, small number of\nnodes \\cite{N}. These models are sometimes considered Legendre transforms of the\nmodels being discussed in this report \\cite{RS1}. However, as was pointed out in\n\\cite{CD}, as the number of nodes gets large the parameters in the model\nbecome redundant, and this confuses any interpretation of phase\ntransitions in such models. One way to understand the difficulty\nis that the constrained entropy in these models is not convex or\nconcave, and the Legendre transform is not invertible \\cite{RS1}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis work was partially supported by NSF grants DMS-1208191 and\nDMS-1509088.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{1234}\n\n\\bibitem{AK} N.\\ Alon and M.\\ Krivelevich, Extremal and probabilistic\n  combinatorics, In {\\em Princeton Companion to Mathematics}, W.
