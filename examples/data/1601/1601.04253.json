Similar effects are also observed in the $3D$ case.\nIn our simulations, the number of topological loops in $\\mathcal{T}_{cq}$ was much smaller than the number of loops in \n$\\mathcal{T}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{T}_{cq}$ produced the correct topological signature on average in about \n$T_{\\min}$ = 28 minutes---a biologically plausible period of time (Figure~\\ref{ThOn}B).\n\nThe success of the clique coactivity complex has a simple intuitive explanation. First, the pairwise coactivities of the place \ncells are produced when the animal enters the domains where at least two place fields overlap. Since these domains are\nbigger than the domains of the higher order overlaps (Suppl. Fig. 2C), the pairwise coactivities are produced and detected \nmore reliably than the high-order coactivities. Second, the process of detecting the pairwise coactivities is spread over time. \nFor example, in order to identify a third order coactivity clique, $[c_i, c_j, c_k]$, one can first detect the coactive pair \n$[c_i, c_j]$, then the pair $[c_j, c_k]$, and then $[c_i, c_k]$, whereas in order to encode a coactivity simplex \n$[c_i, c_j, c_k]$, all three cells must become active within the same coactivity window $w$. As shown on Figure~\\ref{ThOn}C, \nthe higher order combinations take longer to appear than the matching collection of pairs---in fact, most coactivity cliques \nthat can be ``assembled'' over an extended observation process, are never observed as simultaneous coactivity events \n(Suppl. Fig. 3). This implies that the clique coactivity complex is typically bigger and forms faster, and hence the transient \ntopological loops in $\\mathcal{T}_{cq}$ contract sooner. \n\n\n\\begin{figure} \n\\includegraphics[scale=0.84]{Figure3}\n\\caption{\\label{Wind} \\textbf{Timelines of the topological loops in the restricted clique simplicial complexes, obtained for different \ndendritic integration times.} (\\textbf{A}) For $\\varpi = w$ (in which case the clique complex reduces to the simplicial coactivity \ncomplex) spatial learning fails due to numerous \u00e2\u0080\u009cspurious\u00e2\u0080\u009d topological loops that persist indefinitely in 0D, $1D$ and in $2D$. \nHowever, as the dendritic integration time increases to $\\varpi$ = 4 min, the number of topological loops drops, and only \noccasional spurious loops remain for $\\varpi$ = 8 minutes.

From a physiological perspective, the qualitative difference between the results produced by the \n``simplicial'' and the ``clique'' approaches to counting the place cell coactivities suggests that the readout networks should \nbuild their spiking responses not by detecting rare high-order events, but by integrating low order coactivity inputs. The \nphysiological mechanism for such integration may be based on complex subthreshold summation of the action potentials \nimpinging on the dendritic tree of the readout neuron. Once a sufficient number of low order coactivity inputs has been \nreceived, the readout neuron may produce an action potential, thus actualizing the information about the $n$th order \nconnection between the regions encoded by the place cells. \n\nAlthough our modeling approach does not directly address spike integration mechanisms, it allows optimizing parameters \nin a particular readout algorithm, based on the frequency of the place cell (co)activations produced by the animal's movements\nthrough the environment. For example, the model predicts that the coactivity window used by the coincidence detector \nreadout neurons in $2D$ environments should be about $w \\sim 200$ msec wide (smaller $w$s lead to a rapid increase of the \nlearning times and larger $w$s lead to instability of learning \\cite{Arai}), which falls into the physiological range of values \n\\cite{Mizuseki, Huhn}. \n\nWhat would be then the model's estimate of the time required by the ``integrator'' neurons to accumulate the place cell \ncoactivities---the clique integration time, $\\varpi$---to produce a complex that reliably represents space? On the one hand, \nlonger clique integration windows allow collecting more coactivities for assembling the cliques, which improves the structure \nof the coactivity complex (compare Figure~\\ref{ThOn}B and Figure~\\ref{ThOn}A). \nOn the other hand, the larger the $\\varpi$ is, the longer the intervals between the consecutive coactivity inputs $\\tau$ can be, \nso the information about the presynaptic inputs has to be retained for longer. In contrast, the smaller is $\\varpi$, the tighter the \ncoactivities are ``packed'' in the integration window. In cases when $\\varpi \\approx w$, the integrator neuron turns into a \ncoincidence detector, and the clique coactivity complex reduces to the simplicial coactivity complex (i.e., when $\\varpi \\approx w$, \nthe results shown on Figure~\\ref{ThOn}B reduce to Figure~\\ref{ThOn}A). By testing several values of $\\varpi$, we found that \nthe place cell map converges if $\\varpi \\gtrsim 8$ minutes (Figure~\\ref{Wind}A), making this value the model's estimate of \nthe clique integration window. Physiologically, this value corresponds naturally to the timescale of working memory (the memory \nfunctions responsible for the transient holding, processing and retaining the partial results of learning and memory updating \n\\cite{Goldman}).\n\nWe evaluated the combined statistics of the time intervals, $\\tau$, between the pairs of action potentials received by the \nreadout neurons within an integration window, across the cell assembly network.

Recently, there has been a fair amount of \nsuccess in modeling hippocampal spatial maps in rats, assuming a topological perspective on spatial \ninformation processing. In this paper, we use the topological model to study $3D$ learning in bats, which \nproduces several insights into neurophysiological mechanisms of the hippocampal spatial mapping. \nFirst, we demonstrate functional importance of the cell assemblies for producing accurate maps of \nthe $3D$ environments. Second, the model suggests that the readout neurons in these cell assemblies \nshould function as integrators of synaptic inputs, rather than detectors of place cells' coactivity and \nallows estimating the integration time window. Lastly, the model suggests that, in contrast with relatively \nslow moving rats, suppressing $\\theta$-precession in bats improves the place cells capacity to encode \nspatial maps, which is consistent with the experimental observations. \n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{section:intro}\nThe principal neurons in mammals' hippocampus---the place cells---fire in discrete locations within the \nenvironment---their respective place fields \\cite{OKeefe1,Best}. The spatial layout of the place fields---the place \nfield map---is commonly viewed as a representation of the animal's cognitive map of space, although the exact \nlink between them remains unclear \\cite{OKeefe2}. Experiments in ''morphing'' $2D$ environments demonstrate \nthat the place field maps recorded in rats are ``flexible'': as the environment is deformed, the place fields change \ntheir shapes, sizes and locations, while preserving their relative positions \\cite{Gothard,Leutgeb,Wills,Touretzky}, \nwhich suggests that the sequential order of place cells' (co)activity induced by the animal's moves through the place \nfields remains invariant within a certain range of geometric transformations. Moreover, the temporal patterns of place \ncell coactivity is preserved \\cite{Diba, eLife}, which implies that the place cells' spiking encodes a coarse framework \nof qualitative spatiotemporal relationships, i.e., that the hippocampal map is topological in nature \\cite{eLife,Alvernhe,Poucet,Wu}.\n\nRecently, there appeared a few topological models of the hippocampal map \\cite{Chen1, Chen2, Curto}. In particular, \nthe approach proposed in \\cite{Dabaghian,Arai} allows integrating the local spatial information provided by the individual \nplace cells into a large-scale topological representation of the environment. The idea of such integration is based on the \n\\v{C}ech's theorem, according to which the pattern of overlaps between regular spatial domains---the regions---$U_1$, \n$U_2$, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 $U_N$, covering a space $X$, encodes the topological structure of $X$ \\cite{Hatcher}. Specifically, the covering \nregions are used to construct the nerve of the cover, $\\mathcal{N}$---a simplicial complex whose 0D vertices correspond \nto the covering regions $U_i$, the $1D$ links---to pairwise overlaps $U_i \\cap U_j$, the $2D$ facets---to triple overlaps \n$U_i \\cap U_i \\cap U_i$ and so forth. The \\v{C}ech's theorem ascertains that if all of the overlaps between the $U_i$s are \ncontractible in $X$, then $\\mathcal{N}$ is topologically equivalent to $X$. An  implication is that, if the place fields cover the \nenvironment sufficiently densely, then their overlaps should encode its topology. Moreover, since these overlaps are \nrepresented by the place cells' coactivities, a similar construction can be carried out in temporal domain \\cite{Curto,Dabaghian,Arai}:\nif the animal enters a location in which several place fields overlap, the corresponding place cells produce (with a certain probability) \ntemporally overlapping spike trains, which can be received and processed by the downstream brain areas (Suppl.  Fig. 1). \nIn other words, place cells' spiking encodes a ``temporal'' analogue of $\\mathcal{N}$---a coactivity complex, $\\mathcal{T}$, \nthe vertices of which correspond to active place cells $c_i$, $1D$ links---to pairs of coactive cells $[c_i, c_j]$, $2D$ facets---to \ncoactive triples $[c_i, c_j, c_k]$, etc. \n\nBy construction, the coactivity complex incorporates, at any given moment of time $t$, the entire pool of coactivities \nproduced by the place cell ensemble. Hence, it provides a framework for representing spatial information encoded \nby the place cells. For example, a sequence of the place cell combinations ignited along a particular path $\\gamma$ \ncorresponds to a sequence of ``coactivity simplexes''---a simplicial path $\\Gamma$ that represents $\\gamma$ in \n$\\mathcal{T}$. It was shown in \\cite{Dabaghian,Arai} that if the coactivity complex is sufficiently large (i.e., includes \na sufficient number of the coactivity events) and if the parameters of the place cell activity fall into the biological range, \nthen $\\mathcal{T}$ correctly captures the topology of the physical environment, $\\mathcal{E}$. For example, a \nnon-contractible simplicial path corresponds to a class of the physical paths that enclose unreachable or yet unexplored \nparts of the environment. Similarly, two topologically equivalent simplicial paths $\\Gamma_1 \\sim \\Gamma_2$ in $\\mathcal{T}$ \nrepresent physical paths $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ that can be deformed into one another. However, such information \nis not produced immediately: as the animal begins to navigate a new environment, the coactivity complex $\\mathcal{T}$ \nis small and provides an incomplete and fragmented representation of space; moreover, an undeveloped complex \n$\\mathcal{T}$ typically consists of several disjoint components, each one of which may contain gaps and holes that do \nnot correspond to physically inaccessible spatial domains. As the animal continues to navigate, more combinations of \ncoactive place cells are detected, and the ``spurious'' gaps disappear, yielding a coactivity complex that faithfully represents \nthe topological structure of the environment. Thus, the progress of spatial learning can be quantified in terms of the \nevolving coactivity complex's structure, e.g., a list of the holes that it contains at a given moment of time $t$, or a list of \nsurfaces---loops---that encapsulate these holes \\cite{Dabaghian, Hatcher}. Both the holes and the loops are counted up \nto topological equivalence. For example, if two such loops can be deformed into one another, then they are counted as different \nshapes of the same topological object---a topological loop. The number of inequivalent topological loops of a dimensionality \n$n$ is known as the $n$th Betti number, $b_n$, and the list of all Betti numbers, $(b_0, b_1, b_2, ...)$, provides a convenient \n``barcode'' of the space's topological structure \\cite{Ghrist}. Methods of the Persistent Homology theory allow identifying the \ntopological loops in the hippocampal representation of the environment and comparing the resulting Betti numbers \n$b_n(\\mathcal{T})$ with the Betti numbers of the underlying environment, $b_n(\\mathcal{E})$. In addition, it is possible to \ncompute the minimal time, $T_{\\min}$, after which the low-dimensional topological structure of $\\mathcal{T}$ matches \nthe topology of the environment, which serves as a theoretical estimate of the time required to learn a given space \n(Figure~\\ref{PFs}C). \n\nBelow we apply this model to investigate spatial learning in bats that learn $3D$ representations of their environments \n\\cite{Ulanovsky, Yartsev}, which produces a number of neurophysiological insights. \nSpecifically, we simulated place cell spiking activity in a bat navigating a small cave with one vertical column and two \nvertical protrusions, representing a stalactite and a stalagmite (Figure~\\ref{PFs}A). The topological barcode of this \nenvironment is the same as in the $2D$ open field studied in \\cite{Dabaghian,Arai}: $b_0 = 1$ (the cave is connected), \n$b_1 = 1$ (one $1D$ topological loop represents paths encircling the column, but not the contractible stalactite and stalagmite) \nand $b_{n > 1} = 0$ (no loops in higher dimensions). However, the increased complexity of the space mapping task \nelucidates several neurophysiological properties of the hippocampal network that were not explicitly addressed in the \nprevious models.\n\n\n\\begin{figure} \n\\includegraphics[scale=0.84]{Figure1}\n\\caption{\\label{PFs} \\textbf{Topological map of the bat's environment}. (\\textbf{A}) Timelines of $1D$ loops (colored \nhorizontal lines) encoded in a coactivity complex $\\mathcal{T}$.

Our first observation was that, in contrast with the $2D$ environment in which the \ncorrect topological signature emerged in a matter of minutes, the simulated place cell coactivity in $3D$ failed to represent \nthe cave's topology. In particular, the first Betti number of the coactivity complex often vanished, $b_1(\\mathcal{T}) = 0$, \ni.e., the place cells did not capture the most salient feature of the navigated space---the central column, although the bat's \ntrajectory encircled it multiple times.\n\nWe reasoned that the discrepancy between $b_1(\\mathcal{T})$ and $b_1(\\mathcal{E})$ was due to the relatively high \nspeed of the bat's movements, which caused a mismatch between the temporal pattern of place cell coactivities and the \nspatial pattern of the place field overlaps. Indeed, if the bat is flying at the speed $v$, then place cells cofire within a \ncoactivity time window $w$, even if their place fields are up to $d \\approx vw$ apart. If detected by the downstream neurons, \nthese coactivities may lead to an inaccurate representation of space by linking the place cell representations of the physically \nseparated spatial domains. In our simulations, the speed $v$ of the bat reached at times 2 m/sec, while the place cell inputs \nwere integrated over the coactivity window $w = 0.25$ sec \\cite{Arai, Mizuseki, Huhn}. As a result, place cell coactivities \ncould falsely encode overlaps between place fields that are physically up to 50 cm apart. In particular, place fields across the \ncolumn may appear ``connected,'' in which case the column will fail to produce a hole in $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\n\\textbf{Cell assembly constraints}. The result outlined above suggests that the pool of place cell coactivities must be additionally \nconstrained to prevent the appearances of ``faulty'' connections, which, in fact, appeals to well-known neurophysiological \nphenomenon observed in the hippocampal network. Electrophysiological studies suggest that certain select groups of place \ncells form functionally interconnected assemblies, which drive their respective ``reader-classifier'' or ``readout'' neurons in \nthe downstream networks \\cite{Harris, Buzsaki1}. Spiking of the readout neurons ``actualizes'' the information provided by \nthe place cells: if the coactivity of a place cell assembly does not elicit a response of a readout neuron, the corresponding \nconnectivity information does not contribute to the hippocampal map \\cite{Buzsaki1}. Thus, a particular selection of the \nadmissible place cell combinations is determined not only by the place coactivities but also by the architecture of the \nhippocampal cell assembly network, which constrains the pool of place cell coactivities. \n\nIt is widely believed that the readout neurons function as ``all or none'' coactivity detectors, i.e., that they respond to nearly \nsimultaneous activity of the presynaptic cells \\cite{Buzsaki1}. Curiously, the topological approach based on the \\v{C}ech's theorem \ncorroborates with this point of view: the fact that the nerve complex $\\mathcal{N}$ is derived from the spatial overlaps \nbetween the regions suggests that a readout neuron should identify these overlaps by detecting nearly simultaneous place cell \nactivity at the times when the animal visits them. \n\n\n\\begin{figure} \n\\includegraphics[scale=0.84]{Figure2}\n\\caption{\\label{ThOn} \\textbf{Learning a topological map by detecting place cell coactivity}. (\\textbf{A}) A simplicial coactivity \ncomplex, built by detecting high order coactivity events, produces large numbers of persisting topological loops in low \ndimensions. In particular, there are five persistent 0D topological loops (top panel), which implies that hippocampal map \nof the environment is fragmented in pieces. In addition, there are many persistent loops in $1D$ (middle panel) which \nimplies that the coactivity complex encodes many noncontractible paths, whereas there is only one class of noncontractible \nloops in the physical environment. (\\textbf{B}) The number of topological loops in the clique coactivity complex is much smaller. \nIn fact, after the $T_{\\min}$ = 28 minutes (red vertical dashed line), most topological loops disappear, leaving only one \ntopological loop in 0D (which correctly represents the caves connectivity) and one loop in $1D$, which represents physical \npaths circling around the central column. The loops in higher dimensions contract (only the $2D$ loops are shown, bottom \npanel), and thus the correct topological barcode ($b_0 = 1$, $b_1 = 1$, $b_{n > 1} = 0$) emerges. (\\textbf{C}) A particular \nconnection may be identified in two ways: either as a clique (completing at $t_c$, the moment when all the pairs have been \naccumulated), or simultaneously, as a simplex all cells of which are observed at the moment $t_s$. The figure shows the \nprobability distribution of the differences between the first appearance times, $\\Delta =  t_c - t_s$. Since all $\\Delta$s \nare positive, cliques always appear sooner than simplexes.} \n\\end{figure} \n\n\nThese considerations suggest a simple phenomenological solution to the constraint selection task: to exclude the ``spurious'' \nconnections, we built the coactivity complex $\\mathcal{T}$, using only the coactivities produced by place cells with the overlapping \nplace fields. However, our subsequent simulations revealed that the cell assembly constraint is too restrictive, because the resulting \ncoactivity complex broke into pieces (on average, $b_0 = 2.3$) and produced a large number of topological loops in $1D$ and \n$2D$ (on average, $b_1 = 36$ and $b_2 = 410$, Figure~\\ref{ThOn}A).\n\nFrom a biological perspective, this implies that the hippocampal map of the environment remained fragmented and riddled with \nholes, most of which do not correspond to the actual topological obstacles encountered by the bat. In other words, the simulated \ncell assembly network, wired to detect place cells coactivities, fails to learn the correct path connectivity of space, which suggests \nthat the system may employ an alternative mechanism of reading out the coactivity information. \n\n\\textbf{Clique coactivity complexes}. From a mathematical perspective, the higher order overlaps between regions can be not only \nempirically detected, but also derived from the lower order overlaps. According to Helly's theorem \\cite{Avis}, a collection of \n$N > D +1$ convex regions in $D$-dimensional Euclidean space will necessarily have a nonempty common intersection if every \n$D +1$ of them intersect. For example, a collection of $N \\geq 4$ planar regions has a common intersection if any three of them \noverlap and a collection of $N \\geq 5$ regions have a common intersection in $3D$ if any four of them overlap (Suppl.  Fig. 2). \nFrom the perspective of the \\v{C}ech's theorem, this suggests that high-dimensional simplexes in $\\mathcal{N}$ can be deduced \nfrom their low-dimensional simplexes, which opens new possibilities for constructing coactivity complexes.\n\nNumerical simulations demonstrate that, in fact, the approach of Helly's theorem can be extended beyond its strict mathematical \nvalidity. For example, high order overlaps between place fields in $2D$ environments can be reliably identified by detecting \ngraph-theoretic cliques of pairwise overlaps between them (Suppl.  Fig. 2A,B). \n\nMoreover, this information is captured by the place cell coactivity: in the case of the triple place field overlaps, the three pair \ncoactivities, $[c_i,c_j]$, $[c_j, c_k]$ and $[c_i, c_k]$, mark an existing triple overlap of the corresponding place fields in \nover 90$\\%$ of cases, and for the higher order overlaps this percent is even higher.

To test this hypothesis, we numerically suppressed the $\\theta$-precession in the \nsimulated place cells, which lead to a noticeable decrease of the number of spurious topological loops both in the simplicial \nand in the clique coactivity complexes (Figure~\\ref{ThOff}). Second, the learning time produced by the clique complex, \n$T_{\\min}$ = 18 minutes, became shorter than in the $\\theta$-driven coactivity complex.\n\nTo explain these results, we reasoned as follows. One can view the effect of $\\theta$-precession from two perspectives: on \nthe one hand, it synchronizes place cells' spiking and hence increases their coactivity rate \\cite{Skaggs, Buzsaki2}, which \nspeeds up map learning. On the other hand, the fact that the place cells can spike only at specific phases of $\\theta$ can be \nviewed as a constraint that reduces the probability of cells' spiking at every given moment. In \\cite{Arai} we demonstrated \nthat in relatively slow moving rats, the probability of producing spikes during a typical passage through the place field is \nsufficiently high despite the $\\theta$-constraint, so that the main effect of $\\theta$-oscillations is spike-synchronization. In \ncontrast, the results of Figure~\\ref{ThOff} suggest that in bats, the place cells have time to produce only a few spikes during \na high speed flight through the $3D$ place fields, so that the $\\theta$-precession only further reduces the cells' chances of \nbeing (co)active. \n\nWe tested these results by simulating bat's movements at different mean speeds: (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 cm/sec). \nFor each case, 10 simulations were conducted using $\\theta$-precessing place cells and 10 simulations with the $\\theta$-\nprecession turned off. The results on the Figure~\\ref{ThOff}C show that at no point $\\theta$-on ensembles learned faster \nthan the $\\theta$-off ensembles: average time until a stable signature was reached in the $\\theta$-off case was about \n30$\\%$ less than the time required by the $\\theta$-modulated place cell ensembles.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{section:discussion}\n\nThe topological model of the place cell map of space proposed in \\cite{Dabaghian,Arai} provides a framework for bringing \ntogether different scales of spatial learning: the macroscale, i.e., the topological and geometrical parameters of the encoded \nloops, paths, holes, and the microscale, i.e., the parameters of the hippocampal network's neurophysiology. Applying this \nmodel to describe a bat navigating a $3D$ space reveals several interrelationships between these scales that are implicit \nin the $2D$ case, but which have a number of important physiological implications.\n\nFirst, the failure of the na\\\"{i}ve counting of the place cell cofirings indicates a functional necessity of ``thinning out'' the pool of \ncoactivities using a cell assembly network. Qualitatively, this result is based on simple observation: if the readout neurons \nrespond unrestrictedly to the place cell coactivities then the animal's rapid moves across the environment will necessarily \nencode false connections between remote spatial regions, which will result in an incorrect map of space. Second, a striking \ndifference between the simplicial and the clique complexes' ability to capture the topology of the $3D$ environment suggests \nthat the information about the high order spatial relationships should be deduced from low order coactivity events, rather \nthan instantaneously detected. The qualitative reasons for this effect are also transparent: the high order coactivity events, \nrepresented by the simplexes, are rarer and harder to detect than the matching collections of pairwise coactivities, represented \nby the cliques. Third, the amount of time over which readout neurons integrate inputs should be longer than observed in previous \ncomputational or in vitro studies, in which neurons were studied individually and independently from the task solved by the net \nneuronal ensemble \\cite{London, Brody, Magee, Spruston, Rall, Jarsky}. In contrast, our approach provides a basic contextual \ndescription of neuronal activity: the frequency with which the place cells' action potentials impinge on the readout neuron \ndepends on the frequency of the animal's visits to specific spatial locations. This frequency would not change significantly if the \nnumber of simulated place cells would increase, which suggests that our estimates of the ``clique integration windows'' $\\varpi$ \nmay give a correct qualitative estimate of the physiological dendritic integration times required by the downstream networks. \n\nLastly, the model provides a functional insight into why the $\\theta$-precession is physiologically suppressed in bats' hippocampi. \nThus, our model provides an example of a ``top-down'' approach, in which neurophysiological properties of the network are \ndeduced from the task solved by the network.\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\\label{section:methods}\n\\textbf{The navigational parameters}: the mean speed of the bat ($v_{\\rm{mean}} = 66$ cm/s, $v_{\\max} = 150$ cm/s), \nand the dimensions of the environment ($290 \\times 280 \\times 270$ cm) were taken from \\cite{Yartsev}. \nFor increased reliability of the results, the duration of the navigation session (120 min) was longer than reported in \n\\cite{Yartsev}.\n\n\\textbf{Place fields}. The centers of the place fields, $r_c = (x_c, y_c, z_c)$, were uniformly distributed over the \nenvironment, to simulate non-preferential representation of locations. Given the typical sizes of the place fields \n($L_c = 95$ cm), the size of the simulated place cell ensemble was chosen to create enough $2D$ and $3D$ simplexes \nin the coactivity complex, sufficient to build a $3D$ map. Computationally, we could afford about seven place fields per \ndimension, i.e., $N_c = 343$ place cells total, which corresponds to about $N_c = 50$ cells in a the planar $1 \\times 1$ m \nenvironment studied in \\cite{Dabaghian,Arai}. The Poisson spiking rate of a place cell $c$ at a point $r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))$ is \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 24337, "prevtext": "\ncorrespond to the simplexes of the restricted coactivity complex $\\mathcal{T}$, i.e., that the topological structure of the \n``clique complex,'' $\\mathcal{T}_{cq}$, can approximate the topological structure of $\\mathcal{T}$. \n\nIn \\cite{Babichev} we demonstrated that in $2D$, the clique coactivity complexes do not only capture the topology of the \nenvironment, but often perform better than simplicial coactivity complexes. Similar effects are also observed in the $3D$ case.\nIn our simulations, the number of topological loops in $\\mathcal{T}_{cq}$ was much smaller than the number of loops in \n$\\mathcal{T}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{T}_{cq}$ produced the correct topological signature on average in about \n$T_{\\min}$ = 28 minutes---a biologically plausible period of time (Figure~\\ref{ThOn}B).\n\nThe success of the clique coactivity complex has a simple intuitive explanation. First, the pairwise coactivities of the place \ncells are produced when the animal enters the domains where at least two place fields overlap. Since these domains are\nbigger than the domains of the higher order overlaps (Suppl. Fig. 2C), the pairwise coactivities are produced and detected \nmore reliably than the high-order coactivities. Second, the process of detecting the pairwise coactivities is spread over time. \nFor example, in order to identify a third order coactivity clique, $[c_i, c_j, c_k]$, one can first detect the coactive pair \n$[c_i, c_j]$, then the pair $[c_j, c_k]$, and then $[c_i, c_k]$, whereas in order to encode a coactivity simplex \n$[c_i, c_j, c_k]$, all three cells must become active within the same coactivity window $w$. As shown on Figure~\\ref{ThOn}C, \nthe higher order combinations take longer to appear than the matching collection of pairs---in fact, most coactivity cliques \nthat can be ``assembled'' over an extended observation process, are never observed as simultaneous coactivity events \n(Suppl. Fig. 3). This implies that the clique coactivity complex is typically bigger and forms faster, and hence the transient \ntopological loops in $\\mathcal{T}_{cq}$ contract sooner. \n\n\n\\begin{figure} \n\\includegraphics[scale=0.84]{Figure3}\n\\caption{\\label{Wind} \\textbf{Timelines of the topological loops in the restricted clique simplicial complexes, obtained for different \ndendritic integration times.} (\\textbf{A}) For $\\varpi = w$ (in which case the clique complex reduces to the simplicial coactivity \ncomplex) spatial learning fails due to numerous \u00e2\u0080\u009cspurious\u00e2\u0080\u009d topological loops that persist indefinitely in 0D, $1D$ and in $2D$. \nHowever, as the dendritic integration time increases to $\\varpi$ = 4 min, the number of topological loops drops, and only \noccasional spurious loops remain for $\\varpi$ = 8 minutes.

From a physiological perspective, the qualitative difference between the results produced by the \n``simplicial'' and the ``clique'' approaches to counting the place cell coactivities suggests that the readout networks should \nbuild their spiking responses not by detecting rare high-order events, but by integrating low order coactivity inputs. The \nphysiological mechanism for such integration may be based on complex subthreshold summation of the action potentials \nimpinging on the dendritic tree of the readout neuron. Once a sufficient number of low order coactivity inputs has been \nreceived, the readout neuron may produce an action potential, thus actualizing the information about the $n$th order \nconnection between the regions encoded by the place cells. \n\nAlthough our modeling approach does not directly address spike integration mechanisms, it allows optimizing parameters \nin a particular readout algorithm, based on the frequency of the place cell (co)activations produced by the animal's movements\nthrough the environment. For example, the model predicts that the coactivity window used by the coincidence detector \nreadout neurons in $2D$ environments should be about $w \\sim 200$ msec wide (smaller $w$s lead to a rapid increase of the \nlearning times and larger $w$s lead to instability of learning \\cite{Arai}), which falls into the physiological range of values \n\\cite{Mizuseki, Huhn}. \n\nWhat would be then the model's estimate of the time required by the ``integrator'' neurons to accumulate the place cell \ncoactivities---the clique integration time, $\\varpi$---to produce a complex that reliably represents space? On the one hand, \nlonger clique integration windows allow collecting more coactivities for assembling the cliques, which improves the structure \nof the coactivity complex (compare Figure~\\ref{ThOn}B and Figure~\\ref{ThOn}A). \nOn the other hand, the larger the $\\varpi$ is, the longer the intervals between the consecutive coactivity inputs $\\tau$ can be, \nso the information about the presynaptic inputs has to be retained for longer. In contrast, the smaller is $\\varpi$, the tighter the \ncoactivities are ``packed'' in the integration window. In cases when $\\varpi \\approx w$, the integrator neuron turns into a \ncoincidence detector, and the clique coactivity complex reduces to the simplicial coactivity complex (i.e., when $\\varpi \\approx w$, \nthe results shown on Figure~\\ref{ThOn}B reduce to Figure~\\ref{ThOn}A). By testing several values of $\\varpi$, we found that \nthe place cell map converges if $\\varpi \\gtrsim 8$ minutes (Figure~\\ref{Wind}A), making this value the model's estimate of \nthe clique integration window. Physiologically, this value corresponds naturally to the timescale of working memory (the memory \nfunctions responsible for the transient holding, processing and retaining the partial results of learning and memory updating \n\\cite{Goldman}).\n\nWe evaluated the combined statistics of the time intervals, $\\tau$, between the pairs of action potentials received by the \nreadout neurons within an integration window, across the cell assembly network. As shown on (Figure~\\ref{Wind}B), the \ndistribution of these intervals consists of two parts: a sharp delta-like peak, $\\Delta(\\tau) $, concentrated at small values \nof $\\tau$, and an exponential tail,\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nP(\\tau) = C_1\\Delta(\\tau) +C_2e^{-\\mu\\tau}.\n\\label{tau}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"P(\\tau)=C_{1}\\Delta(\\tau)+C_{2}e^{-\\mu\\tau}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04253.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe peak firing rates $f_c$ of different cells were log-normally distributed around the typical  experimental value, \n$f = 8$ Hz and $s_c = L_c /3$ \\cite{Yartsev}. \n\n\\textbf{$\\theta$-phase precession}.

To test this hypothesis, we numerically suppressed the $\\theta$-precession in the \nsimulated place cells, which lead to a noticeable decrease of the number of spurious topological loops both in the simplicial \nand in the clique coactivity complexes (Figure~\\ref{ThOff}). Second, the learning time produced by the clique complex, \n$T_{\\min}$ = 18 minutes, became shorter than in the $\\theta$-driven coactivity complex.\n\nTo explain these results, we reasoned as follows. One can view the effect of $\\theta$-precession from two perspectives: on \nthe one hand, it synchronizes place cells' spiking and hence increases their coactivity rate \\cite{Skaggs, Buzsaki2}, which \nspeeds up map learning. On the other hand, the fact that the place cells can spike only at specific phases of $\\theta$ can be \nviewed as a constraint that reduces the probability of cells' spiking at every given moment. In \\cite{Arai} we demonstrated \nthat in relatively slow moving rats, the probability of producing spikes during a typical passage through the place field is \nsufficiently high despite the $\\theta$-constraint, so that the main effect of $\\theta$-oscillations is spike-synchronization. In \ncontrast, the results of Figure~\\ref{ThOff} suggest that in bats, the place cells have time to produce only a few spikes during \na high speed flight through the $3D$ place fields, so that the $\\theta$-precession only further reduces the cells' chances of \nbeing (co)active. \n\nWe tested these results by simulating bat's movements at different mean speeds: (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 cm/sec). \nFor each case, 10 simulations were conducted using $\\theta$-precessing place cells and 10 simulations with the $\\theta$-\nprecession turned off.

The place field map's connectivity matrix, $P_{ij}$, is based on the place fields' spatial overlap: $P_{ij} = 1$ \nif the distance between the place field centers is smaller than the sum of their half-sizes, $d(c_i,c_j) \\leq (L_i + L_j)/2$, \nand $P_{ij} = 0$ otherwise.
