In particular, we show that this two-port acoustic system can perfectly absorb two high amplitude symmetric incident waves when the additive nonlinear losses in the HR, induced by the jet flow separation, together with the weak linear viscothermal losses of the HR balance the radiation losses to the waveguide. For the case of the one-sided incidence configuration, this condition leads to an absorption equal to $0.5$.\nThis result, which is verified experimentally, is in a good agreement with an analytical nonlinear model of the impedance of the HR. The nonlinear control of perfect absorption using resonators will open new possibilities in the design of high amplitude sound attenuators for aero-engine applications. \n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe inherent viscothermal losses of an acoustic system combined with wave interference can give rise to\nperfect absorption, a phenomenon which is of great applied interest \nin many fields like room acoustics \\cite{Kuttruff,Cox}, duct mufflers \\cite{Munjal}, aeroacoustic liners \\cite{Munjal} and environmental acoustics \\cite{Kotzen}. \n\nIn the particular case of a two-port, resonator/waveguide system, it has been shown that Coherent Perfect Absorption (CPA) can be obtained under a so-called critical coupling condition \nwhen the two-sided incident waves correspond to an eigenmode of the scattering matrix of the system. The critical coupling condition is achieved when the leakage rate of energy out of the resonant system (resonant system-waveguide coupling) is balanced by the resonator losses. \nThis phenomenon has been extensively studied in several fields of wave physics and especially in optics \\cite{Haus,PA1,PA2}. \n\nIn acoustics, the improvement of low frequency sound absorption constitutes a real scientific challenge for the major issue of noise reduction. Resonant structures based on Helmholtz Resonators (HR), bubbles and membranes (sub-wavelength scatterers) provide excellent candidates for the design of efficient, thin and light absorbing structures. \n\nTypically, aforementioned resonators exhibit weak inherent losses. Thus, \nfor a single resonator/waveguide system, critical coupling condition can be fulfilled by using either a highly lossy resonator, for \nexample a poroelastic membrane \\cite{Romero_Report} or viscous metascreens including bubbles \\cite{bubbles}, or by increasing \nartificially the losses in the resonator by filling part of the cavity of the HR with porous material \\cite{Romero_JASA}. On the other \nhand, when the system is composed of several resonators, the interaction of two or more resonant modes of moderate Q-factor can be \nalso used to achieve the critical coupling of the structure \\cite{Merkel}. \nRecently, impedance matched membranes have been also used to turn acoustic reflectors into perfect absorbers \\cite{Ping}.\n\nIn this work we propose an alternative way to achieve the critical condition and thus CPA, using  nonlinear effects\nin a HR to increase its weak linear losses and balance the leakage.\n\nIn the case of a HR coupled to a 1D waveguide, it is known that  sufficiently large amplitude  incident waves\nlead to increased absorption, due to the conversion of acoustical energy  into kinetic rotational energy at the edges of\nthe resonators neck~\\cite{sugi1,chinese,singh1,boek}.\nNote that other nonlinealirities as for example a cubic Kerr-type nonlinearity, can be employed to control the CPA as a function of\nthe incident field amplitude~\\cite{NCPAO}.\nControl of absorption by the wave amplitude with sub-wavelength structures constitutes a topic of great theoretical interest and can find applications in noise reduction, and in the absorption of high amplitude pressure waves in aircraft engines or rocket launch pads. \nBy means of a simplified nonlinear model of the HR, we obtain the CPA conditions and experimentally \nvalidate a maximum absorption equal to 0.5 at the critical coupling, for an one-sided incidence configuration. To further understand the underlying physical mechanisms, experimental results are compared to analytical ones based on a nonlinear impedance model showing a good agreement.\n\n\n\n\\section{Theory}\n\nOur system is composed of a HR side-loaded at $x=0$ to a waveguide, see Fig.~\\ref{theor}. In this section, we derive simplified \nequations that describe the dynamics of the system in the general case of two, high pressure incident waves.\nThe HR that we consider is composed by a cylindrical neck, with a cross-section  $S_n$ and length $l_n$, and a\ncylindrical cavity of cross-section $S_c$ and length $l_c$.  For the low frequency range, the related wavelengths $\\lambda=2\\pi/k$ are much larger \nto the geometric characteristics of  the neck, $k l_n\\ll 1$, and of the cavity, $k(S_cl_c)^{1/3}\\ll 1$. The former leads to the neglection \nof the compressibility of the fluid in the neck\nwhile the later to the assumption that the pressure field inside the cavity is uniformly distributed. \n\nIn this case, the dynamics of the pressure in the cavity of the resonator $p_c(t)$, can be described by the following approximate equation~\\cite{sugi1,chinese,singh1,boek} :\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\ddot{p}_c+\\omega_0^2p_c+R_L\\dot{p}_c+\\alpha|\\dot{p}_c|\\dot{p}_c=\\omega_0^2p_0,\n\\label{ode1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere ($\\dot{}$) indicates differentiation with respect to time, $p_0$ denotes the pressure at the entrance of the resonator (see Fig.~\n\\ref{theor}),\n$\\omega_0^2=c_0^2S_n/l'_nl_cS_c$ is the resonance frequency of the HR, and $c_0$ is the \nspeed of sound.  $l_n'$ indicates the corrected neck length $l_n'=l_n+\\delta l$~\\cite{Kergomard1,Dubos} taking into account both the acoustic radiation into the cavity and the waveguide.\nThe resistance factor  $R_L$ is a small parameter which quantifies the viscothermal losses in the resonator~\\cite{singh1,Melling}.\nThe parameter $\\alpha^{-1}$ of the nonlinear term in Eq.~(\\ref{ode1}), depicts a characteristic pressure beyond which nonlinear losses become important. \nIt is connected with flow separation and vorticity in the neck and it is approximated by $\\alpha^{-1}=2C_{vc}^2\\rho_0\\omega_0^2 \nl_n^{'2}$ (see~\\cite{sugi1,singh1,boek}) where $\\rho$ is the density of air and $C_{vc}^2$ is the {\\it vena-contracta} coefficient\nhaving a value of $\\approx 0.7$ for a neck with hard edges.\nThe nonlinear response of the HR presents different behavior depending on the detailed geometrical characteristics of the edges of \nthe neck~\\cite{Ingard,Dissel,yve,temiz}. Different regimes of this behavior  can be quantified by the Strouhal \nnumber $\\mbox{St} = \\omega d_n/|u_n|$  where $u_n$ is the particle velocity in the neck of the resonator. \nWhen $\\mbox{St}\\gg 1$, particle displacement is smaller than the diameter of the neck and the system is linear. \n In the opposite, strongly nonlinear limit, $\\mbox{St}\\ll 1$ and particle velocities are large enough so that vortices \n are created and are blown away, as a jet, out of the resonator neck. The dynamics, \ndescribed by  Eq.~(\\ref{ode1}), is a good approximation for these limiting cases, and in the strongly nonlinear regime, the term analogous to $\\alpha^{-1}$, quantifies the acoustic energy jetting out of the resonator. On the other hand, for moderate values\nof $St$ and especially for $St\\approx 1$,  there is no analytical model to describe the nonlinear behavior of the HR but, for\nexample, correction functions were proposed in Ref.~\\cite{temiz} to provide a link between the two limits.\n\n\nThe waveguide, in which the HR is side-loaded, is a cylindrical duct of cross-section $S$. \nFor a frequency range well below the first cut-off frequency of the waveguide, \npropagation  is considered one-dimensional. In addition, for small lengths of the waveguide, to avoid the accumulative\nnonlinear behavior, it can be considered linear. Thus, the acoustic  propagation is described by the following\nlinearized mass and momentum conservation laws:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t}+c^2\\rho_0\\frac{\\partial u(x,t) }{\\partial x}=0 ,\\quad \\rho_0\\frac{\\partial u(x,t)}{\\partial t}+\\frac{\\partial p(x,t) }{\\partial x}=0 \\label{mm} \n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $p(x,t)$ and $u(x,t)$ are the pressure and particle velocity in the waveguide. For a HR located at $x=0$, we can write the \nacoustic field inside  the waveguide as:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align}\n&p(x,t)=\\Bigg\\lbrace \\begin{array}{l}\np_1^+(\\xi_+)+p_1^-(\\xi_-) \\quad x\\leq 0,\\\\\n{}\\\\\np_2^+(\\xi_+)+p_2^-(\\xi_-) \\quad x\\geq 0,\n\\end{array} \\label{ansatz}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle p(x,t)=\\Bigg{\\{}\\begin{array}[]{l}p_{1}^{+}(\\xi_{+})+p_{1}^{-}(%&#10;\\xi_{-})\\quad x\\leq 0,\\\\&#10;\\\\&#10;p_{2}^{+}(\\xi_{+})+p_{2}^{-}(\\xi_{-})\\quad x\\geq 0,\\end{array}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"260%\" minsize=\"260%\">{</mo><mtable rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>p</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mo>+</mo></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>p</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mo>-</mo></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd/></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>p</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mo>+</mo></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>p</mi><mn>2</mn><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mo>-</mo></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>\u2265</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable><mi/></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03912.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nThus, CPA occurs at the resonance frequency  $\\omega_0$, under symmetric and in-phase incoming waves, $p_1^+=p_2^-$ \nand when the linear $R_L$ and nonlinear $\\frac{4}{3\\pi}\\frac{|u_n|}{l_n}$ decay rates are balanced with the leakage rate $\\gamma$. \nNote that the CPA condition depends on the cross-section of the waveguide,  and on the geometry of the HR neck\non the cavity.

To do so, we measure the absorption for different amplitudes and frequencies of incident waves $p_1^+$ and verify that nonlinear losses can lead to an absorption of $A=0.5$ when condition~(\\ref{result}) is satisfied.\n\n\\subsection{Setup}\nWe perform experiments using the apparatus shown in the right panel of  Fig.~\\ref{theor}. The \ngeometrical characteristics of the setup are: \n$S=20 \\times 10^{-4}$~m$^2$, $S_n=3.14 \\times 10^{-4}$~m$^2$,\n $S_c=14.5\\times 10^{-4}$~m$^2$, $l_n=0.02$~m and $l_c=0.038$~m. \nA compression driver (Beyma CP800TI), tuned to provide high amplitude waves with very low harmonic distortion, connected to a \nlinear amplifier (Devialet D-Premier), is used as a source at one side of the $50$ cm long waveguide.  An anechoic termination is \nlocated at the \nother side providing reflection below $5\\%$ for the considered range of frequencies and amplitudes.\n\nMeasurements of the pressure are performed at four different positions $x_i$ using a\n$1/4$~inch B\\&K free field microphone. Assuming that the propagation is linear in the waveguide, we experimentally determine $T$, $R$ and $A$ by using the four-microphones method \\cite{Song,Muehleisen}.\nThis procedure is repeated  for several values of the amplitude of the incident wave $|p_1^+|$ from approximately $105$ dB to $160$ dB.\n\n\\subsection{Nonlinear impedance model}\n\nTo compare the experimental results with the theory of the previous section, we note that a nonlinear \nimpedance of the resonator can be obtained from Eq.~(\\ref{ode1}), and it can be written as~\\cite{singh1}\n\n$\nZ_{HR}= i\\mathcal{X}+\\mathcal{R}_L + \\mathcal{R}_{NL}(\\hat{u}_n), \\label{zhr} \n$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{X}$, $\\mathcal{R}_L$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{NL}(\\hat{u}_n)$ are the linear \nreactance, linear resistance and the nonlinear resistance respectively. The linear part of the impedance is found to be $i\\mathcal{X}+\n\\mathcal{R}_L=\\rho_0 l_n\\big(i(\\frac{\\omega_0^2-\\omega^2}{\\omega})+R_L\\big)$ while the nonlinear:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{R}_{NL}(\\hat{u}_n)=\\frac{4\\rho_0|u_n|}{3\\pi S_nC_{vc}^2}.,\n\n\\label{nlnZ}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nWe note that the linear part, which is obtained from the simplified model of Eq.~(\\ref{ode1}), is valid for wavelengths sufficiently \nlarger than the geometric characteristics of the neck and of the cavity. The HR used in our experiments is not strictly in this regime. \nA more accurate expression of the linear HR impedance can be obtained by the transfer matrix method, see\nappendix of~\\cite{Merkel} which predicts a resonance frequency of $f_0'=710$~Hz instead of $f_0=\\omega_0/2\\pi=756$~Hz.\n\nThe nonlinear resistance in Eq.(\\ref{nlnZ}) is linearly dependent on the velocity amplitude, and it is known to be a good\napproximation in the strongly  nonlinear regime ($St\\ll 1$)~\\cite{Ingard,temiz}. Nevertheless, as it is mentioned in Section II, \n the nonlinear response of the resonator highly depends on the detailed geometry of the neck edges, the Strouhal number \n and other factors such as the shear number.\nThus, in order to have a better agreement with the experimental results, we use a nonlinear resistance $\\mathcal{R}_{NL}\\rightarrow F_c \\mathcal{R}_{NL}$, where  $F_c$ has the following form\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nFc=\\frac{1}{1+\\Delta St},\n\\label{fit}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhile the parameter $\\Delta$ is a fitting parameter. The function $F_c$ is chosen according to \nthe recent results of Ref.~\\cite{temiz} to satisfy the corresponding known limits of linear ($\\mbox{St}\\gg1$) and \nnonlinear ($\\mbox{St} \\ll 1$) response of the resonator.\n\nUsing the definitions in Eq.~(\\ref{TnR}) ,we can write the transmittance and reflectance as functions of the impedance \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nT=\\left|\\frac{1}{1+\\sigma}\\right|^2,\\quad R=\\left |\\frac{\\sigma}{ 1+\\sigma}\\right|^2,\\label{TnR2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $\\sigma=c_0S_n\\rho_0/2SZ_{HR}$.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\nIn  panel (a) of Fig.~\\ref{figtheor}, we plot the theoretically obtained absorption for different values of the incident\namplitude $\\vert p_1^+\\vert$,  using the nonlinear impedance model with $\\Delta=0.15$, for a HR corresponding to our experimental setup. As it is observed, for increasing incident \namplitudes the maximum of absorption increases, and reaches the value of $A=0.5$ for  $\\vert p_1^+\\vert=160$~dB at the resonance \nfrequency $f_0'$. The dashed lines correspond to the same amplitude of $\\vert p_1^+\\vert=160$~dB but for different cavity lengths, \n$l_c=5$~cm (left shifted line) and $l_c=3$ ~cm (right shifted line), verifying that $A=0.5$ can be reached at the same amplitude, for \ndifferent frequencies by tuning the length of the cavity. In panel (b) of Fig.~\\ref{figtheor}, the solid \nlines depict the experimentally obtained absorption with the corresponding experimental incident wave amplitudes shown \nin panel (c). Note that small variations of the frequency of  maximum absorption observed in panel (b), are due to the fact that \nthe incident wave amplitudes are  frequency dependent caused by the coupling between the reflected wave and the transducer.\nThe dashed lines in panel (b), show the theoretical prediction as obtained using the nonlinear impedance and the fitting function \n$F_c$ with $\\Delta=0.15$, where the velocity of the neck is calculated using the experimental value s of the incident \npressure shown in panel (c). The good agreement between theory and experiment demonstrates that the nonlinear response of the HR \nis adequately described by the nonlinear impedance with the additional fitting.\n\nTo directly compare the experimental results with the analytical condition for CPA given by  Eq.~(\\ref{result}), in Fig.~\\ref{expgood}\nwe show the absorption for the resonance frequency $f_0'$, as a function of  $\\vert p_1^+\\vert$. \nThe (red) dots depict the experimentally obtained values, and $A=0.5$ is reached for an incident amplitude of   $160$~dB.\nMore importantly, this is the value predicted by  Eq.~(\\ref{result}) as indicated by the vertical dashed line, and\nit verifies  that: critical coupling can be induced by nonlinear \nlosses when, in addition with the linear ones, they balance the leakage to the waveguide. \nThe blue solid line is obtained using the theoretical nonlinear HR impedance with $\\Delta=0.15$, while\nthe dashed line corresponds to the case of $\\Delta=0$ and thus to the prediction of the simplified model of Eq.~(\\ref{ode1}).\nComparing the two theoretical curves, one observes that indeed at the two limits  (linear  $S_t \\gg 1$ and strongly \nnonlinear $S_t \\ll 1$), they coincide as expected (see discussion after Eq.~\\ref{fit}). However in the intermediate \nregime (between $110$ dB and $160$ dB), the impedance with the fitting function describes more accurately the \nexperimental results. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{triplet.png}\n\\caption{(Color online) (a) Absorption as a function of frequency for different incident amplitudes   $|p_1^+|$ as\nobtained using the nonlinear impedance with the fitting parameter $\\Delta=0.15$.

Through this model, we extract the suitable conditions depending\non the geometrical characteristics and on the amplitude of the incident waves, in order to achieve CPA.\nThese conditions imply that CPA occurs at the resonance of the HR, when  the linear and the additive nonlinear losses of the resonator, balance the leakage to the waveguide under symmetric two-sided incidence.\nFor the one-sided incidence case, when the energy leakage criterion is satisfied, the HR is critically coupled giving rise to a maximum of absorption $A=0.5$. Extension of this study into more complex configurations could lead to the design of broadband high amplitude acoustic absorbers with applications into aeronautics.\n\nWe thank Y. Auregan, V.

By integrating Eq.~(\\ref{disc2}) in time, we obtain\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\np_1^+(t,0)-p_1^-(t,0)=p_2^+(t,0)-p_2^-(t,0)+\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\omega_0^2}\\dot{p}_c,\\label{disc3}\n \\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $\\gamma=c_0S_n/2l_n'S$ is a coefficient  describing the coupling strength between the HR and the waveguide.\nFinally, using Eqs.~(\\ref{ode1}), (\\ref{cont}) and (\\ref{disc3}), the dynamics of the pressure $p_c(t)$, inside the HR cavity, is described by the following equation:\n\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\ddot{p}_c+\\omega_0^2p_c+(R_L+\\gamma+\\alpha|\\dot{p}_c|)\\dot{p}_c=\\omega_0^2(p_1^++p_2^-).\n\\label{ode3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\nThe incident waves from the left, $p_1^+$, and from the right, $p_2^-$, act as drivers. The additional dissipative term proportional \nto $\\gamma$, describes the leakage rate of energy out of the HR (resonator-waveguide coupling). \nWhen the  ``boundary conditions'' (i.e. conditions for  incident or outgoing waves) are known, the \nscattering properties of the system are determined by Eqs.~(\\ref{cont}), (\\ref{disc3}) and (\\ref{ode3}).\nBelow we focus on two examples of such conditions i) a case with  two-sided incidence and ii)\na case of an one-sided incidence combined with an anechoic termination.\n\n\\subsection{Two-sided incidence and CPA}\n\nIn the following,  we investigate the boundary condition which corresponds to the phenomenon of CPA\nfor monochromatic incoming waves, i.e.  $p_1^+$, $p_2^-\\propto\\exp[-i \\omega t]$.\nFor the two-sided incident system, CPA boundary condition implies  that outgoing waves must  vanish, namely  $p_1^-=p_2^+=0$. \nFrom Eq.~(\\ref{cont}),  this requirement implies $p_1^+=p_2^-$ which corresponds to a \\textit{symmetric} CPA~\\cite{APL}.\nMoreover, from Eqs.~ (\\ref{cont}) and (\\ref{disc3}),  we obtain that $p_1^++p_2^-=\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\omega_0^2}\\dot{p}_c$ and\nEq.(\\ref{ode3}) can be written as \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\ddot{p}_c+\\omega_0^2p_c+(R_L-\\gamma+\\alpha|\\dot{p}_c|)\\dot{p}_c= 0.\n\\label{ode4}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nNote that due to the CPA condition, the coupling term $-\\gamma \\dot{p}_c$ in Eq. (\\ref{ode4}), appears as  an effective gain.\nSince we are interested in the frequency range close to the resonance, and for sufficiently small pressure amplitudes we consider\nthe nonlinear damping $\\alpha|\\dot{p}_c|\\dot{p}_c$ to be of the same order as the linear term $(R_L-\\gamma)\\dot{p}_c$.\nFor the HR used in our experiments\nand for cavity pressures of approximately $170$~dB the nonlinear coefficient $\\alpha|\\dot{p}_c|/\\omega_0$ \nand the linear damping coefficient $ (R_L-\\gamma)/\\omega_0$ are of the same order $\\epsilon$ and take values~$\\approx 0.2$. \nThus, similarly to \\cite{singh1}, we look for the stationary solution of Eq.~(\\ref{ode4}) applying the Lindstedt-Poincar\\'e perturbation technique \\cite{Nayfeh} up to first order, neglecting the contribution of higher harmonics. \nThe requirement of the annihilation of the secular terms, leads to the conclusion that this particular type of nonlinearity does not introduce a frequency shift, in this order, and imposes the following condition\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{4}{3\\pi}\\frac{|u_n|}{l_n}+R_L=\\gamma.\n\\label{result}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{4}{3\\pi}\\frac{|u_{n}|}{l_{n}}+R_{L}=\\gamma.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><msub><mi>l</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>L</mi></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
