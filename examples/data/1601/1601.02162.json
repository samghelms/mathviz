Thus, it is an important challenge to quantify the stability of attractors with respect to a given perturbation. The most popular method is linear stability analysis which considers infinitesimal perturbations. \\citet{Menck13} suggest to complement this linear measure with basin stability (BS) which accounts for finite and even large perturbations. The application of BS to power grids has yielded novel mitigation strategies against super outages \\citep{menck2014dead,schultz2014detours}. BS is computed by estimating the volume of an attractor's basin. Therefore it is not sensitive to different forms of transient dynamics. However, transient phenomena in complex systems are of large interest in many areas of science, such as climatic and, more generally, global change in Earth system science~\\cite{IPCC2013}, epileptic seizures in neuroscience~\\cite{rabinovich2006dynamical}, ecosystem transitions in ecology~\\cite{scheffer2009early} as well as in the previously mentioned study of super outages in power grids~\\citep{menck2014dead,schultz2014detours}. For example, in the case of climate change~\\cite{IPCC2013} and the great acceleration~\\cite{steffen2015trajectory} as transient phenomena in the global social-environmental system~\\cite{Schellnhuber1998,Schellnhuber1999}, major efforts are invested into studying the maximum global mean temperature and its timing along the trajectory due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the model- and data-driven analysis of transient global change trajectories underlies many recently proposed frameworks for sustainable development such as tolerable environment and development windows~\\cite{petschel1999tolerable}, planetary boundaries~\\cite{rockstrom2009,steffen2015planetary} and the safe and just operating space for humanity~\\cite{Raworth2012}.\\\\\n\\textcolor{new}{ Making BS sensitive to transients, we generalize it to a family of stability measures termed constrained basin stabilities (CBSs). As opposed to BS, CBS is not computed from the entire basin of an attractor but only from a subset of the basin. The subset is defined by a generic constraint imposed on the transients. Thus, CBS is sensitive to transients while, maintaining the intuitiveness and simplicity of BS. To illustrate how CBS complements BS, we choose two specific constraints on transients, one based on the confinement of transient trajectories to certain regions in phase space and one based on transient duration, and apply them to the Lorenz system and a global carbon cycle model respectively. In the former example, CBS anticipates a boundary crisis bifurcation. In the latter, we show that CBS represents a more intuitive measure for stability than BS because CBS reflects not only that perturbation-induced transients return to the attractor but also that they do so within a desirable time interval.}\\\\\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Sec.~\\ref{Methods} we introduce CBS and discuss some of its properties used in the further analysis. In Sec.~\\ref{Application} we present two examples of CBS analysis in dynamical systems: the paradigmatic \\citet{lorenz1963} model and a global carbon cycle model proposed by \\citet{anderies2013topology}. Then, in Sec.~\\ref{Discussion} we discuss the relevance of CBS and how it differs from established stability concepts. The paper concludes with closing remarks.\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\\label{Methods}\n\nLet the \\textcolor{new}{(not necessarily analytic)} vector valued function $f$ represent an autonomous potentially multistable dynamical system $\\dot{\\textbf{x}} = f(\\textbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $\\phi^t(\\textbf{x}_0)$ be the system state at time $t$ on a trajectory starting at $\\textbf{x}_0$ at $t=0$. The basin stability BS($A$) of an attractor $A$ of this system quantifies the probability that after a finite size perturbation trajectories return to $A$~\\cite{Menck13}. Perturbations within the attractor's basin $\\mathcal{B}(A)$ return but the remaining ones fall into a different attractor. The probability distribution of perturbing a trajectory on the attractor to the state $\\textbf{x}$ is given by $\\rho(\\textbf{x})$.

This information is encoded in a set $C$ of states the transients originating from which satisfy a given requirement, such as monotonicity in the previous example. We suggest classifying these requirements as static, dynamic and integrated, depending on how much information is necessary to find out which desirable region of phase space corresponds to them: (i)~Static requirements a-priori define a phase space region $\\Gamma' \\subset \\Gamma$ that must not be entered by the transient. No further knowledge of the system or its dynamics is required. Examples are planetary boundaries in Earth system dynamics~\\cite{rockstrom2009,steffen2015planetary}, minimum/maximum operating temperatures of a device or the evaluation of external functions (not $f$) of the system, e.g. the performance of a second system that depends on the system state $\\textbf{x}$. (ii)~Dynamic requirements depend on velocity, thus more knowledge about the system is required: the dynamics, i.e. $f$, must be known. Using this knowledge, a region similar to $\\Gamma'$ is defined. Consider, for example, a roller coaster that must not exceed a certain velocity or acceleration or the requirement of monotonicity in economic output to exclude the burst of market bubbles. (iii)~Integrated conditions depend not only on the current state of the transient but also on its past, i.e. they operate on an infinite dimensional space and memory effects are possible. Despite this complexity, testing integrated conditions is often easy in practice as can be seen from the following examples: imposing a limited number of opinion changes of a political party, thresholding the time needed to reach an attractor, integrated damage in a climate model or imposing a minimum average power output of a wind farm per time interval.

This information is encoded in a set $C$ of states the transients originating from which satisfy a given requirement, such as monotonicity in the previous example. We suggest classifying these requirements as static, dynamic and integrated, depending on how much information is necessary to find out which desirable region of phase space corresponds to them: (i)~Static requirements a-priori define a phase space region $\\Gamma' \\subset \\Gamma$ that must not be entered by the transient. No further knowledge of the system or its dynamics is required. Examples are planetary boundaries in Earth system dynamics~\\cite{rockstrom2009,steffen2015planetary}, minimum/maximum operating temperatures of a device or the evaluation of external functions (not $f$) of the system, e.g. the performance of a second system that depends on the system state $\\textbf{x}$. (ii)~Dynamic requirements depend on velocity, thus more knowledge about the system is required: the dynamics, i.e. $f$, must be known. Using this knowledge, a region similar to $\\Gamma'$ is defined. Consider, for example, a roller coaster that must not exceed a certain velocity or acceleration or the requirement of monotonicity in economic output to exclude the burst of market bubbles. (iii)~Integrated conditions depend not only on the current state of the transient but also on its past, i.e. they operate on an infinite dimensional space and memory effects are possible. Despite this complexity, testing integrated conditions is often easy in practice as can be seen from the following examples: imposing a limited number of opinion changes of a political party, thresholding the time needed to reach an attractor, integrated damage in a climate model or imposing a minimum average power output of a wind farm per time interval.

This illustrates the general behavior observed in the L63 system and quantified by CBS, namely that the volume fraction of the three-dimensional sampling region occupied by $C^\\pm$ decreases continuously as $r$ approaches $r_3$.\n}}\n\\label{CrossSectionL63}\n\\end{figure}\n\nBS and CBS are computed for $15,625$  initial conditions sampled from the uniform perturbation distribution $\\rho(\\textbf{x}) = \\tfrac{1}{40}\\Theta(20 - |x|)\\tfrac{1}{40}\\Theta(20 - |y|)\\tfrac{1}{30}\\Theta(15-|z|)$, which describes a box that roughly covers the attractor. To compute BS, we evolve each initial condition in time until it reaches either one of the fixed points or the chaotic attractor. The termination condition in the former case is that the trajectory enters an $\\varepsilon$-ball around $\\mathbf{x}_\\star ^{\\pm}$, here $\\varepsilon=10^{-4}$. In the latter case, we iterate until the trajectory has crossed the plane $H$ a large (but computationally feasible) number $m$ of times, here $m=400$.\n\\Cref{BS_L63} shows the resulting BS and CBS. The BS and CBS curves are identical for both fixed points due to their symmetry. Thus, only the values for the positive fixed point are shown.\nFor any conditioned set $C$ and its complement $\\overline{C}=\\Gamma \\backslash C$, \\Cref{eq:Property2} reduces to $\\mathrm{BS}(A) = \\mathrm{BS}^C(A) + \\mathrm{BS}^{\\overline{C}}(A)$. This implies that the difference between the two stability measures reflects the fraction of the basin from where (long) chaotic transients originate. The magnitude of CBS reflects the opposite, i.e. the part of the basin from where trajectories fall into the fixed point without crossing $H$. For $9 \\leq r \\leq 14$, the two stability measures are constant but differ in their value. For $14\\leq r\\leq 23$ the fraction of chaotic transients increases continuously (in agreement with \\Cref{CrossSectionL63}), while the basin volume, i.e. BS, does not change. Between $r \\approx 23$ and the bifurcation point at $r_2$, the basins of the fixed points collapse as the fraction of trajectories exceeding $m$ crossings grows rapidly. In the limit $m \\rightarrow \\infty$, the basin size changes discontinuously at $r_2$: the fraction of the basin that corresponds to the chaotic transients at $r<r_2$ suddenly feeds the newly born attractor when $r>r_2$. In \\Cref{BS_L63} the drop is not discontinuous due to finite simulation time: long transients do not reach the fixed points before the simulation is ended.  From $r_2$ to $r_3$, both stability measures coincide because chaotic transients are absent due to the chaotic saddle now being attractive. For $r>r_3$, both BS and CBS vanish. \nIn short, with BS alone we cannot anticipate the crisis at $r_2$. However, combining it with CBS, the emergence of the chaotic set can be observed by the increasing fraction of chaotic transients within the fixed points' basins. Although CBS does not predict the bifurcation at $r_2$, it does indicate the approaching crisis while BS does not and thus it substantially complements the original BS by revealing additional information on the basin structure.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.53\\textwidth]{./CBSBSL63.pdf}\n\t\\caption{(Color online) \\textcolor{new}{BS (green (upper) line) and CBS (red (lower) line)} of the positive fixed points in the L63 system as the parameter $r$ is varied.

The difference between the two curves represents the fraction of the basin from where chaotic transients evolve. Note that BS exhibits a jump at $r_2$ which is blurred by the finite simulation time: the simulation stopped before all (increasingly long) transients had reached the fixed point.

This illustrates the general behavior observed in the L63 system and quantified by CBS, namely that the volume fraction of the three-dimensional sampling region occupied by $C^\\pm$ decreases continuously as $r$ approaches $r_3$.\n}}\n\\label{CrossSectionL63}\n\\end{figure}\n\nBS and CBS are computed for $15,625$  initial conditions sampled from the uniform perturbation distribution $\\rho(\\textbf{x}) = \\tfrac{1}{40}\\Theta(20 - |x|)\\tfrac{1}{40}\\Theta(20 - |y|)\\tfrac{1}{30}\\Theta(15-|z|)$, which describes a box that roughly covers the attractor. To compute BS, we evolve each initial condition in time until it reaches either one of the fixed points or the chaotic attractor. The termination condition in the former case is that the trajectory enters an $\\varepsilon$-ball around $\\mathbf{x}_\\star ^{\\pm}$, here $\\varepsilon=10^{-4}$. In the latter case, we iterate until the trajectory has crossed the plane $H$ a large (but computationally feasible) number $m$ of times, here $m=400$.\n\\Cref{BS_L63} shows the resulting BS and CBS. The BS and CBS curves are identical for both fixed points due to their symmetry. Thus, only the values for the positive fixed point are shown.\nFor any conditioned set $C$ and its complement $\\overline{C}=\\Gamma \\backslash C$, \\Cref{eq:Property2} reduces to $\\mathrm{BS}(A) = \\mathrm{BS}^C(A) + \\mathrm{BS}^{\\overline{C}}(A)$. This implies that the difference between the two stability measures reflects the fraction of the basin from where (long) chaotic transients originate. The magnitude of CBS reflects the opposite, i.e. the part of the basin from where trajectories fall into the fixed point without crossing $H$. For $9 \\leq r \\leq 14$, the two stability measures are constant but differ in their value. For $14\\leq r\\leq 23$ the fraction of chaotic transients increases continuously (in agreement with \\Cref{CrossSectionL63}), while the basin volume, i.e. BS, does not change. Between $r \\approx 23$ and the bifurcation point at $r_2$, the basins of the fixed points collapse as the fraction of trajectories exceeding $m$ crossings grows rapidly. In the limit $m \\rightarrow \\infty$, the basin size changes discontinuously at $r_2$: the fraction of the basin that corresponds to the chaotic transients at $r<r_2$ suddenly feeds the newly born attractor when $r>r_2$. In \\Cref{BS_L63} the drop is not discontinuous due to finite simulation time: long transients do not reach the fixed points before the simulation is ended.  From $r_2$ to $r_3$, both stability measures coincide because chaotic transients are absent due to the chaotic saddle now being attractive. For $r>r_3$, both BS and CBS vanish. \nIn short, with BS alone we cannot anticipate the crisis at $r_2$. However, combining it with CBS, the emergence of the chaotic set can be observed by the increasing fraction of chaotic transients within the fixed points' basins. Although CBS does not predict the bifurcation at $r_2$, it does indicate the approaching crisis while BS does not and thus it substantially complements the original BS by revealing additional information on the basin structure.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.53\\textwidth]{./CBSBSL63.pdf}\n\t\\caption{(Color online) \\textcolor{new}{BS (green (upper) line) and CBS (red (lower) line)} of the positive fixed points in the L63 system as the parameter $r$ is varied.

The difference between the two curves represents the fraction of the basin from where chaotic transients evolve. Note that BS exhibits a jump at $r_2$ which is blurred by the finite simulation time: the simulation stopped before all (increasingly long) transients had reached the fixed point.

Thus, we compute CBS of the desirable fixed point based on \\Cref{Andi-condition}. We consider a perturbation density $\\rho$ describing a depletion of the terrestrial carbon stock $c_t$ (e.g. by immense wildfires). The released carbon is fed into the atmospheric carbon stock $c_a$. We implement this scenario using a uniform perturbation density on a line in phase space: the terrestrial carbon stock is depleted to a value $c_t\\in[0,(c_t)_\\star^d)$ while the marine carbon stays constant, $c_m = (c_m)_\\star^d$ and the atmospheric carbon increases according to the carbon conservation law $c_a = 1-c_m-c_t$.

This reflects the fact that perturbations result in undesirable trajectories much more frequently as human carbon offtake increases until, at $\\alpha\\approx 0.31$, the return time for the considered perturbations always exceeds $t_{crit}$. Even though $\\alpha<\\alpha_{crit}$, none of the perturbed trajectories can avoid passing through a long quasi-global desert state. On this parameter interval the desired state is unstable with respect to CBS but stable with respect to BS. We suggest that the former measure provides a more meaningful notion of Earth system resilience from an anthropocentric point of view: it measures the probability that perturbations decay within a predefined acceptable time horizon, while the latter only measures the probability of returning within any (possibly infinite) time horizon. Further, CBS captures the change in transient structure and therefore reveals a signal of the transition in the Anderies model already at values of $\\alpha$ significantly smaller than $\\alpha_{crit}$. In contrast, BS is discontinuous (within numerical accuracy) at $\\alpha_{crit}$ and does not exhibit any precursory phenomena. \\textcolor{new}{\\Cref{cuts_anderies} shows the set $C$ defined above in \\Cref{Andi-condition} and $\\mathcal{B}$, the basin of attraction of the desirable fixed point for two different values of $\\alpha$.}\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.53\\textwidth]{./CBSBSanderies.pdf}\n\t\\caption{(Color online) \\textcolor{new}{ BS (straight lines) and CBS (curved red line) of $\\mathbf{x}_\\star^d$ and $\\mathbf{x}_\\star^{ud}$ versus the human carbon offtake rate $\\alpha\\in[0,0.6]$ for $t_{crit} = 90$.

While BS is computed from an attractor's basin, CBS is computed from a subset of the attractor's basin. The subset is defined by the transient behavior of trajectories originating from this subset. Thus, CBS represents potentially very complicated transient behavior as an easy to interpret scalar quantity.\\\\\nTo underpin that a compact representation of transient behavior is highly relevant in applications, we have presented two examples using specific constraints on the transients.} In the case of Rayleigh-B\\'enard \\textcolor{new}{dynamics in the scope of the Lorenz63 model} we used the static constraint that the sense of rotation of convection rolls does not change. \\textcolor{new}{Here, CBS uncovers nonlinear precursory phenomena of a boundary crisis bifurcation. In the global carbon cycle model by Anderies et al.~\\cite{anderies2013topology}} we have studied the stability of the desirable state for a specific perturbation scenario under the premise that it can be restored within an acceptable time horizon. \\textcolor{new}{CBS reflects the fact that long return times to the attractor after a perturbation are not desirable. More generally,} these applications demonstrate the three main advantages of CBS over BS: (i)~CBS provides useful information in the case of global attractors, \\textcolor{new}{while BS cannot be meaningfully applied (it is always equal to 1).} (ii)~Sudden changes in basin size are often preceded by a change in transient behavior. Extending linear notions of early warning signals for incipient bifurcations~\\cite{scheffer2009early}, CBS uncovers these nonlinear precursory phenomena in the case of the Lorenz63 model and helps anticipating the boundary crisis. (iii)~CBS reflects the fact that certain perturbation-induced transients are often undesirable, e.g. long return times\\textcolor{new}{, thus allowing one to define highly relevant stability measures for a specific application.\\\\\nThe importance of BS lies in its applicability to a wide range of dynamical systems in various fields. The concept of CBS is even more general as it encompasses BS as special case. However, to apply CBS, we must choose a specific constraint, such as a limit on the return time. This choice strongly depends on a specific application, revealing highly relevant information there but potentially not being as useful in other applications. By providing two examples of useful constraints and by defining CBS precisely, formally and in close analogy to BS, we hope to facilitate the transfer of ideas between different applications and different generalizations of BS. For example, BS has been employed successfully to study power grid stability \\cite{menck2014dead}. CBS could be used to develop more specific notions of stability, e.g. to impose that certain units recover quickly from mega outages or to constrain the total energy loss on the way of recovery. Another example is ecology where BS has proven to be a useful concept and transients are important \\cite{dai2015relation}. CBS could be used to quantify questions of how fast ecosystems recover or investigate potential early warning signals based on minimal abundances of certain species after transients. More generally, BS has successfully applied in resilience research \\cite{holling1973resilience,folke2004regime} and we expect interesting results from further investigating the notion of constrained resilience based on constraints on transients. We expect that future work on CBS will yield a set of transient-constraints that prove valuable across a wide range of different applications.}\\\\\nCBS can be used in both passive and active experimental settings. In the former, we have only limited or no control of the system, e.g. the Earth system. We start with some normative notion of undesirable transients as the time threshold in the Anderies example. \\citet{heitzig2015topology} discuss desirability in relation to phase space topology. From a given notion of desirability, a constraint is derived. Then, CBS addresses the question of how stable the system is with respect to perturbation-induced transients given that only some of them are desirable. If a system parameter varies over time, CBS is capable of revealing a stability trend which can justify an action to reverse the parameter change. It remains an open problem how CBS can be inferred experimentally or from observational data if a satisfactory model of the system is not available. In principle, if long time series of some environmental parameter (e.g. forest cover on the Earth's surface) can be derived from measurements and if many natural perturbations can be observed in the data, such as volcanic eruptions, then these can be exploited to estimate CBS. In the active setting, we use CBS to foster our understanding of the system without needing a normative proposition. The constraint and the perturbation are chosen such that new information about the structure of the basin of attraction is revealed. This situation is analogous to the Lorenz63-example: restricting the number of flips between the two halves of phase space (i.e. the two convection senses), the basin of attraction can be subdivided according to the number of flips. Thus, CBS helps to characterize a system that is subject to perturbations. In this active setting, it is easier to measure CBS: the system parameters can be chosen freely and the number of perturbations is not restricted by historic events. \\\\\nThe specific condition (\\ref{eq:L63-condition}) is reminiscent partly of the concept of 'viability' \\cite{aubin2007introduction,aubin2011viability}, although there are significant differences: in particular, in our case, there are no management options and more importantly, we are considering deterministic dynamics while viability theory incorporates stochastic and more generally non-deterministic processes. Furthermore, (\\ref{eq:L63-condition}) can easily be generalized by allowing for trajectories to 'pierce through' $H$ once or multiple times - these generalizations are not related to viability theory. Another concept that has certain features in common with the condition (\\ref{eq:L63-condition}) is 'survivability' \\citep{hellmann2015survivability}. There too, a desirable region of phase space is designated as in the case of our choice of $C^{\\pm}$. However, survivability does not incorporate the asymptotic nature of BS: it depends on the fraction of trajectories starting in a designated region of phase space spending a certain time exclusively in that region. In particular, it does not depend on which attractor trajectories converge to in the long-time limit. For these reasons, CBS is different from both viability theory and survivability and presents a novel and broadly applicable concept for quantifying stability of an attractor with respect to a given not only small perturbation, uniting both the asymptotic features of BS and the transient features of survivability. \nIn conclusion, CBS represents a general framework to quantify the stability of attractors with broad applicability in various fields with an interest in complex dynamical systems, ranging from physics and technology to sustainability science.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nThe research reported in this article was developed within the working group ``Complex systems perspectives on anthropogenic climate change'' at the Natur- and Ingenieurwissenschaftliches Kolleg sponsored by the German National Academic Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes) and in the scope of the COPAN project on coevolutionary pathways at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.
