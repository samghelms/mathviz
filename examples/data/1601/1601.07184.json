Other key properties of MBL phases include a discrete local spectrum and vanishing conductivity~\\cite{Basko06a,Basko06b},\na logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy~\\cite{Znidaric08,Bardarson12,Serbyn2013-1}, and a complete set of local integrals of motion that describe the entire\nmany-body spectrum~\\cite{Huse2013,Serbyn2013}.\n\nThe description of many-body localization generally assumes a system where, in the limit of vanishing electron-electron interactions,\nthe system becomes an Anderson insulator in which all single-particle states are localized. The eigenstates of a many-body\nlocalized system are connected to the eigenstates of the Anderson insulator by a finite-depth local unitary transformation~\\cite{bauer2013}.\nRecent work~\\cite{li2015,modak2015} has raised the question of whether MBL can also exist in a system where\nin the non-interacting limit, a critical single-particle energy, the mobility edge, separates localized and delocalized states.\nIn one dimension, this can be achieved in certain types of quasi-disordered systems, and it is a generic scenario in higher dimensions.\nFor a particular incommensurate potential, Ref.~\\onlinecite{li2015} found three regimes: a many-body localized phase; an ergodic phase;\nand an intermediate phase that exhibits volume-law entanglement scaling but violates eigenstate thermalization in a more subtle way\nby having a large eigenstate-to-eigenstate variance of the expectation value of local operators, even in narrow energy windows.\nThese regimes are separated by many-body mobility edges, i.e.\\ critical energy densities separating localized from delocalized states in the\nmany-body spectrum. The existence of such many-body mobility edges has been suggested based both\non analytical~\\cite{Basko06a,Basko06b} and numerical~\\cite{kjall2014,luitz2015} observations; however, recent\nwork has raised concerns about the stability of such a scenario~\\cite{deroeck2015}.\n\nA closely related question concerns the stability of many-body localization in open quantum systems, i.e.\\ when coupled to bath degrees\nof freedom. Usually a bath is taken to be very large and the backaction of the system onto the bath is neglected. In this case (as well as\nin the presence of dissipation~\\cite{levi2015,fischer2015}), one\nexpects that the effects of many-body localization will be destroyed, although there is evidence for a crossover into a regime where some\nsignatures of localization persist~\\cite{Nandkishore2014,Gopalakrishnan2014,Johri2015}.\nHowever, one can also consider the case where the number of degrees of freedom in the system and the bath is comparable\nand the backaction may be important. In this case, the interesting possibility arises that the backaction of the MBL system may be strong enough to induce localization in the bath~\\cite{nandkishore2015}. The results of Ref.~\\onlinecite{li2015} may be interpreted as evidence for such a scenario.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.6\\columnwidth]{model.pdf}\n  \\caption{Schematic illustration of our setup. Here, the disorder potential only acts on the lower chain of the ladder ($\\alpha=0$),\n  whereas the fermions in the upper chain are affected by the disorder only through the interactions. The fermions, indicated as\n  red dots, hop along each chain, and interact only through a repulsive density-density interaction on each rung.\n  \\label{fig:ladder} }\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn this paper, we investigate these questions by numerically and analytically studying a model for spinless fermions on a ladder, as sketched in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ladder}.\nWe introduce an uncorrelated\ndisorder potential on one chain of the ladder, while keeping the other chain translationally invariant, and forbid hopping between the chains such that\nin the non-interacting limit, the chains are completely decoupled. We then introduce a local density-density interaction on each rung.\nWith interactions, two sharply distinct scenarios appear: in one, the energy transport through the clean chain is sufficient\nto trigger delocalization of the entire system. In the other scenario, the localized fermions -- through the density-density interaction -- act\nas effective disorder potential for the fermions in the clean chain, inducing their localization.\nTo distinguish these two scenarios, we will consider the entanglement entropy of highly excited eigenstates as well as the time evolution\nof the entanglement entropy. We find that in our model, both scenarios can be realized depending on the parameters of the system.\nWe will comment on other possible intermediate scenarios at the end.\n\nOur model is closely related to the model of Ref.~\\onlinecite{yao2014}, where the disorder potential is absent but the hopping strength in the\ntwo chains is vastly different and interactions between the chains are very strong.\nThis model was studied in the context of dynamical effects akin to many-body localization in systems without\nexplicit translational symmetry breaking in the Hamiltonian~\\cite{schiulaz2014,hickey2014,deroeck2014} (see also~\\cite{grover2014-qdl}),\nbut where the initial conditions break translational symmetry.\nIt was observed that the time evolution starting from random product state configurations exhibits slow dynamics at an intermediate time scale,\nyet relaxes at the longest time scales, consistent with with the formation of a ``quasi many-body localized\" (qMBL) regime.\nFurthermore, the system shows a diverging susceptibility towards spin glass ordering upon introducing disorder.\nOur results are complementary in that we consider the case of strong disorder and weak interactions, and focus primarily on eigenstate rather than dynamical\nproperties. We discuss the relationship between the models in more detail towards the end of Section~\\ref{sec:numerics}.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Sec.~\\ref{sec:model}, we describe the model, our diagnostics and the numerical\napproach in more detail. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:pert}, we discuss a perturbative analysis of the interchain coupling. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:numerics},\nwe describe our numerical results, and conclude in Sec.~\\ref{sec:concl}.\n\n\\section{Model and numerical approach}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the system is (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:ladder})\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align} \\label{eqn:H}\n    \\hat{H} =& -\\sum_\\alpha t_\\alpha \\sum_{i = 1}^L \\left( \\hat{c}^\\dag_{\\alpha, i} \\hat{c}_{\\alpha, i+1} + \\text{h.c.} \\right) \\\\ \\notag\n&+ \\sum_{i = 1}^{L} w_i \\hat{n}_{d,i} + V\\sum_{i = 1}^{L}\\hat{n}_{d,i} \\hat{n}_{c,i}.\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\hat{H}=\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mi/></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle-\\sum_{\\alpha}t_{\\alpha}\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\left(\\hat{c}^{\\dagger}_{%&#10;\\alpha,i}\\hat{c}_{\\alpha,i+1}+\\text{h.c.}\\right)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></munder></mstyle><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>L</mi></munderover></mstyle><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow><mo>\u2020</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mtext>h.c.</mtext></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle+\\sum_{i=1}^{L}w_{i}\\hat{n}_{d,i}+V\\sum_{i=1}^{L}\\hat{n}_{d,i}%&#10;\\hat{n}_{c,i}.\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>L</mi></munderover></mstyle><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>L</mi></munderover></mstyle><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07184.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a target energy.

In $d$ dimensions, this leads to the scaling $S \\sim L^{d-1}$,\nas opposed to the volume law $S \\sim L^d$ that is expected for generic systems that obey eigenstate thermalization. Eigenstate\nentanglement has subsequently been used as powerful criterion to identify many-body localized phases~\\cite{bauer2013,kjall2014,luitz2015}.\n\nWe use eigenstate entanglement as diagnostic of whether the system described by Eq.~{(\\ref{{eqn:H}})} delocalizes or localizes.\nOn a coarse level, distinguishing between a volume law and an area law allows us to determine whether the system is localized\nor not. Beyond this, if we find that the system exhibits a volume law, we can consider the entropy density to determine whether\nall microscopic degrees of freedom participate or whether some degrees of freedom remain localized.\n\nSpecifically, we consider the entanglement cuts illustrated in the top panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:entropyillustration}. The cuts correspond to a contiguous block\nof sites in the clean (disordered) chain, which we label as ${S^\\mathrm{c}}$ (${S^\\mathrm{d}}$), as well as a cut that contains both chains, labeled as ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$.\nIn the generic case where the two chains are coupled, an area law will only appear in ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$, since for the other cuts the area of the\nboundary scales with the volume of the block. However, in the non-interacting case $V=0$ where the two chains are completely decoupled,\nthe entropy of each of the chains separately can provide valuable insights.\n\nThe bottom panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:entropyillustration} schematically illustrate the behavior of the various entropy cuts.\nThe lower left panel shows the case of decoupled, non-interacting chains ($V=0$): the delocalized fermions in the clean layer contribute a volume law, ${S^\\mathrm{c}} = s_\\text{th} L$\nwhere $s_\\text{th} \\approx \\log 2$ is the thermal entropy density of a single layer at infinite temperature. The localized layer, on the\nother hand, exhibits a volume law only for blocks smaller than the localization length $\\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$~\\cite{grover2014} and saturates to a\nconstant beyond that. The total entropy, ${S^\\mathrm{b}}={S^\\mathrm{d}}+{S^\\mathrm{c}}$, thus shows a volume law with prefactor $2 s_\\text{th}$ for\n$l < \\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$, and crosses over to a volume law with a reduced prefactor $s_\\text{th}$ for $l > \\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$.\n\nIn the interacting case, the two scenarios discussed above are localization and delocalization of the entire system. These are illustrated\nin the lower right panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:entropyillustration}: If the system becomes fully localized on some scale $\\xi'$, the entanglement\nentropy for the joint system ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$ will exhibit an area law for $l > \\xi'$ (note that while the figure shows the case $\\xi' = \\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$, this need\nnot necessarily be the case). If, on the other hand, the system fully delocalizes, the entropy\nwill show a volume law with prefactor $2 s_\\text{th}$ for all scales. Thus, in either scenario a strong signature appears in the eigenstate\nentanglement: the entropy either becomes constant, or the coefficient of the volume law doubles.\n\n\\section{Perturbative analysis of interchain coupling}\n\\label{sec:pert}\n\nWe expect that the eventual fate of the localization or thermalization of the ladder rests on the outcome of a competition between the tendency for the disordered chain to localize the states on the clean chain and the ability of the states in the clean chain to act as a thermalizing bath for the disordered chain. Before turning to direct numerical simulations, we consider the limit of weak interactions, $V\\ll t_d,t_c$, where we can work perturbatively in $V$ near the decoupled chain limit to estimate which of these effects is more important.\n\nFor $V=0$, the clean chain has no randomness and exhibits extended single-particle eigenstates. With $V\\neq0$, however, if the disordered chain remains localized, the random distribution of charges $\\langle \\bar{n}_{d,i} \\rangle$ in a given eigenstate produces an effective disorder potential $\\mu_i\\approx V{\\langle}n_{d,i}{\\rangle}$ in the clean chain. Due to the one-dimensional nature of the system, even an infinitesimally weak random potential will produce localization. In the case of weak interactions and thus weak disorder, localization occurs via quantum interference, and we can perturbatively estimate (using Fermi's golden rule) the localization length in the clean chain to be $\\xi_V \\approx t_c^2 / (V^2\\,\\delta n_d^2)$, where $\\delta n_d^2\\approx \\rho_d(1-\\rho_d)$ and $\\rho_d$ is the mean density of particles in the disordered chain.\n\nAs a technical aside, this treatment amounts to a Hartree-type approximation of the inter-chain interaction to obtain an effective disorder potential $\\mu_i = V{\\langle}n_{d,i}{\\rangle}$ for the clean chain. Note that Fock-type exchange self-energies are zero in this model where particle number in each chain is separately conserved.\nNext, we will perturbatively incorporate interactions using the Hartree-dressed Green functions.\n\nIn the absence of this tendency towards localization, energy can propagate along the disordered chain mediated by resonant interactions with states in the clean chain. We can perturbatively estimate whether such resonant interactions can persist in spite of the tendency towards developing a finite localization length $\\xi_V$ in the clean chain. The typical level spacing for particle-hole excitations in the clean chain is:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 11144, "prevtext": "\nHere, $c_{\\alpha,i}^\\dagger$ creates a fermion on the upper, clean ($\\alpha=c$) or lower, disordered ($\\alpha=d$) layer.

In the center of the many-body energy band,\nwhere $\\beta \\rightarrow 0$, one expects that the entropy density is close to its maximal value as given by the density\nof degrees of freedom.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n  (a) \\\\\n  \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth]{cuta.pdf}\n  & \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth]{cutb.pdf}\n  & \\includegraphics[width=0.3\\linewidth]{boxcut.pdf} \\\\\n  ${S^\\mathrm{d}}$ &${S^\\mathrm{c}}$ &${S^\\mathrm{b}}$\n  \\end{tabular}\n  \\vspace{0.3in} \\\\\n\n  (b) \\\\\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{entropygraph.pdf}\n  \\caption{(a) Different entanglement cuts considered in this paper.

In $d$ dimensions, this leads to the scaling $S \\sim L^{d-1}$,\nas opposed to the volume law $S \\sim L^d$ that is expected for generic systems that obey eigenstate thermalization. Eigenstate\nentanglement has subsequently been used as powerful criterion to identify many-body localized phases~\\cite{bauer2013,kjall2014,luitz2015}.\n\nWe use eigenstate entanglement as diagnostic of whether the system described by Eq.~{(\\ref{{eqn:H}})} delocalizes or localizes.\nOn a coarse level, distinguishing between a volume law and an area law allows us to determine whether the system is localized\nor not. Beyond this, if we find that the system exhibits a volume law, we can consider the entropy density to determine whether\nall microscopic degrees of freedom participate or whether some degrees of freedom remain localized.\n\nSpecifically, we consider the entanglement cuts illustrated in the top panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:entropyillustration}. The cuts correspond to a contiguous block\nof sites in the clean (disordered) chain, which we label as ${S^\\mathrm{c}}$ (${S^\\mathrm{d}}$), as well as a cut that contains both chains, labeled as ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$.\nIn the generic case where the two chains are coupled, an area law will only appear in ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$, since for the other cuts the area of the\nboundary scales with the volume of the block. However, in the non-interacting case $V=0$ where the two chains are completely decoupled,\nthe entropy of each of the chains separately can provide valuable insights.\n\nThe bottom panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:entropyillustration} schematically illustrate the behavior of the various entropy cuts.\nThe lower left panel shows the case of decoupled, non-interacting chains ($V=0$): the delocalized fermions in the clean layer contribute a volume law, ${S^\\mathrm{c}} = s_\\text{th} L$\nwhere $s_\\text{th} \\approx \\log 2$ is the thermal entropy density of a single layer at infinite temperature. The localized layer, on the\nother hand, exhibits a volume law only for blocks smaller than the localization length $\\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$~\\cite{grover2014} and saturates to a\nconstant beyond that. The total entropy, ${S^\\mathrm{b}}={S^\\mathrm{d}}+{S^\\mathrm{c}}$, thus shows a volume law with prefactor $2 s_\\text{th}$ for\n$l < \\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$, and crosses over to a volume law with a reduced prefactor $s_\\text{th}$ for $l > \\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$.\n\nIn the interacting case, the two scenarios discussed above are localization and delocalization of the entire system. These are illustrated\nin the lower right panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:entropyillustration}: If the system becomes fully localized on some scale $\\xi'$, the entanglement\nentropy for the joint system ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$ will exhibit an area law for $l > \\xi'$ (note that while the figure shows the case $\\xi' = \\xi_\\mathrm{loc}$, this need\nnot necessarily be the case). If, on the other hand, the system fully delocalizes, the entropy\nwill show a volume law with prefactor $2 s_\\text{th}$ for all scales. Thus, in either scenario a strong signature appears in the eigenstate\nentanglement: the entropy either becomes constant, or the coefficient of the volume law doubles.\n\n\\section{Perturbative analysis of interchain coupling}\n\\label{sec:pert}\n\nWe expect that the eventual fate of the localization or thermalization of the ladder rests on the outcome of a competition between the tendency for the disordered chain to localize the states on the clean chain and the ability of the states in the clean chain to act as a thermalizing bath for the disordered chain. Before turning to direct numerical simulations, we consider the limit of weak interactions, $V\\ll t_d,t_c$, where we can work perturbatively in $V$ near the decoupled chain limit to estimate which of these effects is more important.\n\nFor $V=0$, the clean chain has no randomness and exhibits extended single-particle eigenstates. With $V\\neq0$, however, if the disordered chain remains localized, the random distribution of charges $\\langle \\bar{n}_{d,i} \\rangle$ in a given eigenstate produces an effective disorder potential $\\mu_i\\approx V{\\langle}n_{d,i}{\\rangle}$ in the clean chain. Due to the one-dimensional nature of the system, even an infinitesimally weak random potential will produce localization. In the case of weak interactions and thus weak disorder, localization occurs via quantum interference, and we can perturbatively estimate (using Fermi's golden rule) the localization length in the clean chain to be $\\xi_V \\approx t_c^2 / (V^2\\,\\delta n_d^2)$, where $\\delta n_d^2\\approx \\rho_d(1-\\rho_d)$ and $\\rho_d$ is the mean density of particles in the disordered chain.\n\nAs a technical aside, this treatment amounts to a Hartree-type approximation of the inter-chain interaction to obtain an effective disorder potential $\\mu_i = V{\\langle}n_{d,i}{\\rangle}$ for the clean chain. Note that Fock-type exchange self-energies are zero in this model where particle number in each chain is separately conserved.\nNext, we will perturbatively incorporate interactions using the Hartree-dressed Green functions.\n\nIn the absence of this tendency towards localization, energy can propagate along the disordered chain mediated by resonant interactions with states in the clean chain. We can perturbatively estimate whether such resonant interactions can persist in spite of the tendency towards developing a finite localization length $\\xi_V$ in the clean chain. The typical level spacing for particle-hole excitations in the clean chain is:\n\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\delta^{(2)}\\approx \\frac{1}{\\Lambda_c\\left(\\nu_c\\xi_V\\right)^2}\\approx \\frac{V^4}{t_c^3}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\delta^{(2)}\\approx\\frac{1}{\\Lambda_{c}\\left(\\nu_{c}\\xi_{V}\\right%&#10;)^{2}}\\approx\\frac{V^{4}}{t_{c}^{3}}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><msup><mi>\u03b4</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msup><mo>\u2248</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mi>V</mi></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2248</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><msup><mi>V</mi><mn>4</mn></msup><msubsup><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mn>3</mn></msubsup></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07184.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nFixing our attention on a specific pair of orbitals in the disordered chain, the number of such transitions that are resonantly connected by matrix element $\\Gamma$ is of order $N_\\text{res}\\approx \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\delta}\\approx \\frac{t_c}{V}$, which is large for weak interactions, and in fact diverges in the limit of $V\\rightarrow 0$.

The slope corresponds to\n    the entropy density, which is observed to increase drastically as interactions are increased, compatible\n    with all degrees of freedom contributing to the entropy.\n    \\label{fig:boxentropy_unit} }\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe first consider the case of equal hopping strength in the clean and disordered layer, $t_d = t_c = 1$. In Fig.~\\ref{boxpic}, we show\nthe behavior of different entropy cuts in this case for a system with a total of $2L=20$ sites and disorder strength $W=4$.\nFirst we consider the results in the non-interacting case, $V=0$. Here, we observe a volume law for ${S^\\mathrm{c}}$ (left-most panel), while\nthe disordered system exhibits a saturation of the entanglement entropy ${S^\\mathrm{d}}$ for $l \\gtrsim 3$ (center panel). Note that for\n$V=0$, ${S^\\mathrm{d}}(l)={S^\\mathrm{d}}(L-l)$ (and similarly for ${S^\\mathrm{c}}$), which is not true for $V \\neq 0$.\nBy identifying the saturation point of the entropy for ${S^\\mathrm{d}}$, we can read off that the\nlocalization length for $W=4$ is $\\xi_\\mathrm{loc} \\approx 3$. The right-most panel shows the joint entropy ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$, which for\n$V=0$ is simply the sum of the two contributions and is therefore dominated by the volume law in the clean chain.\n\nAs we turn on interactions between the two layers ($V > 0$), we observe that the entanglement entropy for each cut increases dramatically.\nFor the entropy cuts isolating each chain, this is expected as the boundary between the two chains begins to contribute\nto the entanglement entropy. However, we note that in the limit of strong enough interactions, the entropies ${S^\\mathrm{d}}$ and ${S^\\mathrm{c}}$ become approximately\nequal, indicating that there is no distinction between the two chains. Considering the joint entropy, we find that the entropy\nat the center of the system approximately doubles from ${S^\\mathrm{b}}(L/2) \\approx 2.8$ to ${S^\\mathrm{b}}(L/2) \\approx 5.8$.\nThis is consistent with a volume law contribution from both chains. The maximum measured value at the center of the system is close\nto the upper bound ${S^\\mathrm{b}}(L/2) \\approx 6.9$; the discrepancy can be attributed to finite-size corrections.\nThese results are strongly suggestive of delocalization of the entire system for $V > 0$.\n\nTo further investigate this, we consider the cut at the center of the system, ${S^\\mathrm{b}}(L/2)$, for various system sizes and interaction\nstrengths as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:boxentropy_unit}. In the left panel, we have rescaled the entropy by the system size to convert to an\nentropy density. We observe that the entanglement increases rapidly as interactions are turned on for each system size.\nThe increase sharpens as the system size is increased, indicating that at least in this parameter regime the entire\nsystem delocalizes for infinitesimal interaction strength $V$ in the thermodynamic limit. For small system sizes, the entropy decreases for very large\ninteractions, but this effect does not appear to persist to larger system sizes.\nIn the right panel, we analyze the finite-size dependence of the entropy at the center of the system, which clearly exhibits a volume-law\nscaling. The coefficient of the volume law increases rapidly as interactions are turned on.\n\n\\subsection{Narrow-bandwidth bath}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig4varyhopping.pdf}\\\\\n    \\caption{Entropy ${S^\\mathrm{b}}(L/2)$ for a center cut of the system for various disorder strengths $W$ and hopping in the clean chain, $t_c$.\n    As disorder is increased and the hopping $t_c$ reduced, we observe a crossover from a regime where interactions tend to\n    increase entropy to a regime where interactions decrease entropy, i.e.\\ drive the system towards localization.}\n    \\label{boxentropy}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=0.5\\textheight]{fig6.pdf}\n\\caption{Maximum entropy ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$ for various $L$ and interlayer couplings $V$, allowing the hopping strength to vary. For very large interlayer coupling, the system appears to localize at small hopping in the clean chain.}\n\\label{fig:hopbox}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWhile the results of the previous section confirm that the system tends to delocalize, as suggested by the considerations\nin Sec.~\\ref{sec:pert}, it may still be possible to change the parameters of the system in such a way as to enhance\nthe tendency towards localization.\nWe focus here on the effect of tuning the hopping strength in the clean layer, $t_c$. By reducing\nthis hopping strength, we can reduce the bandwidth of the delocalized degrees of freedom, which reduces the amount\nof energy the bath can absorb.\nThis regime was previously studied in Ref.~\\onlinecite{Gopalakrishnan2014}.\nClearly, in a limit where $t_c \\ll \\delta E$, where $\\delta E$ is the mean level spacing of many-body energy levels,\nthe system will not delocalize; however, this requires an exponentially small bandwidth $t_c \\sim 2^{-L}$. In a more\nphysical regime, where $\\delta E \\ll t_c \\ll t_d$ and $t_c \\ll W$, one may still expect that the bath is inefficient at delocalizing\nthe system because its bandwidth is small compared to the energy mismatch of nearby fermion states in the disordered\nsystem, which is of order $W$; however, higher-order resonances may invalidate this simple picture.\n\nOur numerical results are summarized in Figs.~\\ref{boxentropy} and \\ref{fig:hopbox}. In Fig.~\\ref{boxentropy}, we show\nthe entropy at the center of the system as a function of interaction strength $V$ for three different strength of the disorder and several\nvalues of the hopping in the clean chain $t_c$, while keeping $t_d=1$. For slightly reduced values of $t_c$, such as $t_c=0.5$, we find behavior that is\nvery similar to the case $t_c=t_d=1$. However, for strongly reduced hopping of $t_c = 0.1$ and sufficiently strong disorder, the entropy does\nnot increase rapidly -- as was seen in the left panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:boxentropy_unit} -- but rather remains constant, or even decreases in the\ncase of strong disorder $W=8$. This implies that as interactions are turned on, the system tends towards localization rather than\ndelocalization.\n\nTo explore whether this is a robust effect that persists to the thermodynamic limit, we examine how this behavior depends\non the system size over the limited range available to our exact numerics. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:hopbox}, we show\nthe entropy at the center of the system versus system sizes, for an array of hopping strengths $t_c \\in [0.1,0.5]$ (keeping $t_d=1$)\nand disorder strengths $W=2,4,8$.\n\nFor weak disorder ($W=2$, top row), we observe that interactions suppress the entropy for small systems and $t_c \\leq 0.25$, but for sufficiently\nlarge systems the behavior changes and the entropy of the interacting system exceeds that of the decoupled chains and the\ncoefficient of the volume becomes comparable to that in the case $t_c=t_d$. The scale\nat which this crossover takes place depends on the choice of $W$ and $t_c$, and appears to shift to larger and larger systems\nas $W$ is increased and $t_c$ reduced. For example, for $W=4$ and $t_c = 0.1$ (leftmost panel of the middle row) the crossover\nscale appears to be slightly larger than the system sizes available to us.\n\nWe note that such an upturn of the entropy seems at odds with the results put forward\nin Ref.~\\onlinecite{grover2014}, which argued that $\\partial^2 S(\\ell)/\\partial \\ell^2 \\leq 0$, where $S(\\ell)$ is the entropy\nof a contiguous block of $\\ell$ sites in a system of total size $L$. However, this result only holds for $\\ell \\ll L$, whereas\nhere we have the case $\\ell = L/2$ and therefore no clear separation between the two scales $\\ell$ and $L$.\n\nFinally, in the case of strong disorder ($W=8$), small bath bandwidth ($t_c < 0.2$), and sufficiently strong interactions,\nthe entropy remains strongly suppressed for all values of the interaction strength and the entire range of system\nsize accessible to our numerics. This is suggestive of a many-body localized phase of both chains in this limit.\nHowever, given the finite-size crossover behavior observed away from this limit, we cannot rule out delocalization\nof the system on a very long length scale.\n\n\\subsection{Time evolution}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics{timeevolve.pdf}\n  \\caption{Time evolution of the entanglement entropy ${S^\\mathrm{b}}(L/2)$ for $V=10$ and $2L=16$ total sites.\n  The top panel shows data for $t_c=0.001$, corresponding to Fig. 2 of Ref.~\\onlinecite{yao2014},\n  while the bottom panel shows $t_c=0.1$ for comparison to Fig.~\\ref{fig:hopbox}. }\n  \\label{fig:te}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo obtain further insights into the putative localized regime at strong disorder and weak bath hopping and to connect our\nresults to those of Ref.~\\onlinecite{yao2014}, we repeat some of the numerical experiments performed\nthere in the presence of weak disorder. To this end, we prepare the system in a randomly chosen product state,\nevolve under the Hamiltonian~{(\\ref{{eqn:H}})} (where, following~\\cite{yao2014}, we from here forward impose periodic boundary conditions),\nand compute the entropy ${S^\\mathrm{b}}$ at the center of the system as a function\nof time $T$. We average the results over different initial states, and in the case of $W>0$ also over 10 different disorder realizations.\nFor each case, we smooth the data by taking the maximum over 6 adjacent time samples.\nWe note that these results are obtained for much stronger interaction $V$ and much smaller $t_c$ than the\nresults reported in the previous sections.\n\nOur results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:te}. Here, the parameters for the upper panel match those of Ref.~\\onlinecite{yao2014},\nin particular $t_c=0.001$, $t_d=1$, and the disorder-free case $W=0$ exactly matches the data presented there.\nUpon adding even a very weak disorder potential, the evolution\nof the entropy for large time scales -- beyond the equilibration of local degrees of freedom on a scale $1/t_d$ -- changes\ndrastically: the slow divergence of the entropy at very large times that is observed in the quasi-MBL phase, and\nassociated with a slow relaxation of the system at all length scales, appears completely suppressed in the case of\na weakly disordered system.\nFurthermore, the entropy saturates to a far sub-thermal value for both $L=4$ (not shown) and $L=8$ even\nfor the weakest disorder potential $W=0.01$. These results are\nconsistent with the observation of a many-body localized regime in this limit in the entanglement entropy\nof highly excited eigenstates, and is also consistent with the observation of a divergent susceptibility to spin glass ordering\nin Ref.~\\onlinecite{yao2014}.\n\nIncreasing the hopping in the clean chain to $t_c=0.1$ (bottom panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:te}), we find that a weak disorder potential suppresses\nthe saturation entropy only slightly, while a sufficiently strong potential in the disordered chain is still able to\nsuppress the entropy for both chains. While a finite critical disorder strength necessary to drive the system into the MBL phase\nappears at odds with a quasi-MBL regime in the clean limit, our numerical observation may also be due to a\nlarge localization length compared to the available system sizes. In either interpretation, these results\nare consistent with the observation of a possible MBL phase\nin a similar parameter regime in the entropy of eigenstates, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:hopbox}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:concl}\n\nWe have proposed a system of spinless fermions on a ladder, where one chain of the ladder is translationally invariant\nwhile the other experiences a disorder potential. This system can serve as a prototypical example to study many-body\nlocalization effects in a system where in the limit of vanishing interactions, localized and delocalized degrees of freedom\ncoexist. Equivalently, the system allows us to study the effect of coupling a small bath to a many-body localized system.\nExploiting the large degree of tunability of the model, we have found that while in most of the phase diagram the system\ntends towards delocalization, a many-body localized regime -- and thus localization of the bath through induced disorder\nfrom the MBL system -- may appear in a regime where the bandwidth of the bath is small compared to the disorder strength.\n\nIn the entanglement of eigenstates, this localization of the entire system is heralded by a decreasing entanglement entropy\nas a function of the interaction strength. Attempting to extrapolate to larger systems, we find a broad regime of parameters\nwhere the trend of suppression of the entropy by interactions reverses for larger system sizes, and the\nsystem tends towards delocalization as the system size is increased. By taking the hopping in the clean chain\nvery small and the disorder very strong, we obtain a regime where the entropy remains small for all system sizes accessible\nto our numerics; however, we cannot answer in the affirmative whether we\nobtain a genuine many-body localized phase of both chains, or rather a regime where the crossover to delocalization\ntakes place at an extraordinarily large system scale.\n\nTurning to the time evolution of the entropy starting from random initial product states, a strong suppression of the\nsaturation entropy is observed in a similar parameter regime, providing further support for a many-body localized phase.\n\nFinally, we comment on the intermediate non-ergodic yet delocalized phase observed in Ref.~\\onlinecite{li2015} in a window of many-body\nenergy densities between a localized regime at low energies, and a fully ergodic delocalized regime at high energies. Since\nthe crossover regime in the problem considered here is parametrically very large, reliably observing such a regime appears\nvery challenging and has not been attempted systematically. However, we point out that tuning into such a regime as a\nfunction of energy is less natural in the model considered here, since in the single-particle limit localized and delocalized\nstates coexist at all energies, whereas in the model of Ref.~\\onlinecite{li2015} the energy density can be understood as tuning\nthe relative number of localized and delocalized orbitals in the non-interacting limit. A more natural parameter to replicate\nthe phase diagram in our model would thus be the relative filling of the clean and disordered chains. However, given the\nsmall range of system sizes available to us, changing the average inter-particle distance is likely to incur larger finite-size\ncorrections.\n\n\\acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Chris Laumann, Sankar Das Sarma, Sarang Gopalakrishnan and Sid Parameswaran for insightful discussions.\nThis research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, under Grant No.\\ DMR-14-04230 (JRG), and by the Caltech Institute of Quantum Information and Matter, an NSF Physics Frontiers Center with support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (JRG).\n\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No. DGE 1144085.

Then, for $|x_a-x_b|<\\xi_d$, and $|x_{\\alpha,\\beta}-x_a|<\\xi_V$ the matrix element for the interchain interaction among these orbitals is roughly:\n\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\Gamma_{(a,b);{\\alpha,\\beta}} &\\approx V\\int dx\\ \\phi^*_\\alpha(x)\\phi_\\beta(x)\\phi^*_a(x)\\phi_b(x) \\\\\n& \\approx \\frac{V}{\\xi_V}\\approx \\frac{V^3}{t_c^2}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\Gamma_{(a,b);{\\alpha,\\beta}}\" display=\"inline\"><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>;</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></msub></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\approx V\\int dx\\ \\phi^{*}_{\\alpha}(x)\\phi_{\\beta}(x)\\phi^{*}_{a}%&#10;(x)\\phi_{b}(x)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>\u2248</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><mi>x</mi></mpadded></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>*</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>\u03b2</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>a</mi><mo>*</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>b</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mstyle></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\approx\\frac{V}{\\xi_{V}}\\approx\\frac{V^{3}}{t_{c}^{2}}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>\u2248</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mi>V</mi><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mi>V</mi></msub></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2248</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><msup><mi>V</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msubsup><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
