The A and B pair offers a unique possibility to study stellar physics in stars that are only slightly different from our own Sun. Their masses -- 1.1 and 0.9 Msun -- nicely bracket that of our neighbour star, and they are only slightly older than the Sun. Thus, $\\alpha$ Cen is an ideal laboratory for stellar evolution \\citep[e.g.][]{Kervella-2003:a,PortodeMello-2008:a,Bruntt-2010:a,Bazot-2012:a}, asteroseismology \\citep{Kjeldsen-2008:a,deMeulenaer-2010:a} and extra-solar planet searches \\citep{Dumusque-2012:a,Rajpaul-2015:a,Bergmann-2015:a,Endl-2015:a}. As such it is crucial to determine with the highest accuracy the properties of the two stars in $\\alpha$ Cen, which can be done as double-lined spectroscopic  visual  binaries, thus offering a hypothesis-free determination of the distance and individual masses \\citep{Pourbaix-1998:a}. One also needs to have the most precise orbital elements to disentangle any other effects, such as oscillations or the presence of a planetary-mass companion.\n\n\\citet{Pourbaix-1999:b} presented the first simultaneous adjustment of the relative positions and radial velocities of both components of $\\alpha$ Cen, yielding an upward revision of the masses.  Owing to the special interest of the asteroseismology  community for this system, an international team was gathered later on to obtain some accurate radial velocities of both components.  The outcome was a set precise radial velocities which were used to quantify the relative convective blue shift of both components, assuming the individual masses and the parallax of the system \\citep{Pourbaix-2002:a}. \n\nEven if it turned out to be a false detection \\citep{Hatzes-2013:a,Rajpaul-2015:a}, the announcement of a planetary companion around $\\alpha$ Cen B \\citep{Dumusque-2012:a} suddenly resurrected the interest of the planet hunters for that stellar system \\citep{Kaltenegger-2013:a}. We therefore decided to determine for the first time, in a self-consistent manner, the individual masses, the parallax, and the net shift caused by gravitation and convection, using an extensive set of homogeneous and accurate radial velocities of both components from the ESO HARPS science archive. The observations are described in Sect.~\\ref{sec:observations} while the adopted model used to fit them is described in Sect.~\\ref{sec:model}.  Results are listed in Sect.~\\ref{sec:results} and discussed in the context of asteroseismology in Sect.~\\ref{sec:discussion}.\n\n\n\\section{Observational data}\\label{sec:observations}\n\n$\\alpha$~Cen has been the target of many radial velocities (RV) measurements, especially, with HARPS, the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher at the ESO La Silla 3.6m telescope. The vacuum and thermally isolated HARPS instrument has been especially designed for high-precision radial velocities observations \\citep{Mayor-2003:a}, reaching for example a dispersion of 0.64 m~s$^{-1}$ over 500 days \\citep{Lovis-2006:a}.\n\nThe velocities of both components of  $\\alpha$~Cen were retrieved from the HARPS archive maintained by ESO: 2015 velocities for A and 4303 for B.  Despite the possibility of selecting the target on the ESO archive interface, a visual inspection was necessary to assign the velocities to the right component.  Further imposing that the seeing does not exceed 1 arcsec so as to avoid $\\alpha$ Cen A contaminating $\\alpha$ Cen B and vice versa (as suggested by the referee, Xavier Dumusque), limited these observations to 710 and 1951 for A and B respectively.  The importance of this data set lies in the simultaneous or quasi simultaneous observations of both components with an instrument that provides RVs on an almost absolute scale. \n\nWe used the radial velocities provided by the HARPS pipe\\-line.  For $\\alpha$~Cen A, the RV is obtained by cross-correlating the spectra with a G2 V flux template which is the Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) spectrum of the Sun \\citep{SoFlAt}, and calibrated so as to have an offset in the zero-point of 102.5 {m~s$^{-1}$}\\ \\citep{Molaro-2013:a}. For $\\alpha$~Cen B, the cross-correlation was done with a K5 template.  The median of the velocity precision for A and B are respectively 0.16 and 0.12 {m~s$^{-1}$}\\ (Fig.~\\ref{fig:ccferr}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{alphaCen2015Fig3.eps}}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption[]{\\label{fig:ccferr}Distribution of the estimated radial velocity uncertainties reported by the HARPS pipeline for component A (left) and B (right).}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe HARPS data cover 11 years only (13\\% of the orbital period), but at the crucial time when the radial velocities cross (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:plot}). The HARPS data were completed with some older ESO data \\citep{Endl-2001:a}, obtained with the Coud\\'e Echelle Spectrograph (CES) at the 1.4-m Coud\\'e Auxiliary Telescope and later, at the 3.6-m telescope, both in La Silla, to extend the baseline and to help improving the precision of the fractional mass ($\\kappa=M_B/(M_A+M_B)$).  These velocities being relative, the datasets of A and B were shifted to share the HARPS zero point.\n\nThese very accurate radial velocities were complemented with the same visual observations (both micrometric and photographic) as used in our previous investigation \\citep{Pourbaix-1999:b}.  According to its web portal, the Washington double star catalogue \\citep{Hartkopf-2001:b} holds 37 additional visual observations (up to 2014.241) with respect to our original investigation.  These data were kindly provided by the WDS team and added to the 1999 dataset for the sake of completeness.  In practice, no parameter from the visual orbit was affected.\n\n\n\\section{Model}\\label{sec:model}\n\n\nThe model used by \\citet{Pourbaix-1999:b} assumes that the measured radial velocities represent the radial velocities of the barycentre of each component:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:rvB}\n  \\begin{array}{l}\n  V_A=V_0-K_A(e\\cos\\omega_B+\\cos(\\omega_B+v)),\\\\\n  V_B=V_0+K_B(e\\cos\\omega_B+\\cos(\\omega_B+v)),\n  \\end{array}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\begin{array}[]{l}V_{A}=V_{0}-K_{A}(e\\cos\\omega_{B}+\\cos(\\omega_{B}+v)),\\\\&#10;V_{B}=V_{0}+K_{B}(e\\cos\\omega_{B}+\\cos(\\omega_{B}+v)),\\end{array}\" display=\"block\"><mtable displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>B</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>B</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01636.tex", "nexttext": "\nIt is worth pointing that, whereas \\citet{Pourbaix-1998:a} advocated for a simultaneous adjustment of the visual and spectroscopic data, this $\\Delta V_B$ term has to be introduced because the solutions for $V_A$ and $V_B$ are obtained simultaneously!  Indeed, if the two curves were modelled independently, two distinct $V_0$ would be obtained but $K_A$ and $K_B$ would represent the semi-amplitudes of the two curves.  Without $\\Delta V_B$, the simultaneous fit introduces a bias on $V_0$, $K_A$, and  $K_B$.\n\nThe orbit of the stellar system being our only goal, no short timescale variation \\citep{Dumusque-2011:a,Dumusque-2015:a} is modelled in the present investigation.\n\n\n\\section{Results}\\label{sec:results}\n\nDespite the absence of visual departure between the fit of the present dataset with and without $\\Delta\\ V_B$, the parallaxes differ by 2\\% (smaller without shift), directly impacting the total mass by the same amount as the fractional mass remains essentially unchanged.  The reduced $\\chi^2$ increases from 1.01 to 1.21 without the shift. The revision of the model is thus justified.

It is somewhat closer to the original Hipparcos value, $742\\pm1.42$ mas \\citep{Hipparcos}, and rules out the result obtained in the revision of the Hipparcos catalogue \\citep{Hip2} where the parallax is $754.81\\pm4.11$ mas.  Even though the parallax is different, the total mass of the system perfectly matches the 'photometric' estimate from \\citet{Malkov-2012:a}, thus indicating some possible flaw in their mass-luminosity relation.

These results were somehow confirmed by \\citet{Kervella-2003:a} through the measurement of the angular diameter of both components and adopting the parallax by \\citet{Soderhjelm-1999:b}.  Combining their own results with those of \\citet{Thevenin-2002:a}, they also derived a likely parallax of $745.3\\pm2.5$ mas.\n\nUsing asteroseismology only, \\citet{Lundkvist-2014:a} obtained $1.10\\pm0.03$ {M$_\\odot$}\\ and $0.97\\pm0.04$ {M$_\\odot$}, very consistent with our values.  They also derived $1.22\\pm0.01$ {R$_\\odot$}\\ and $0.88\\pm0.01$ {R$_\\odot$}\\ for the radius of component A and B respectively, matching the values obtained by \\citet{Kervella-2003:a}.  Adopting the angular diameters from the latter ($8.511\\pm0.020$ mas and $6.001\\pm0.034$ mas for A and B) and our revised parallax yield $1.231\\pm0.0036$ {R$_\\odot$}\\ and $0.868\\pm0.0052$ {R$_\\odot$}\\ for the radii of A and B, also in good agreement with \\citet{Lundkvist-2014:a}.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\nAs stressed by several authors \\citep{Torres-2010,Halbwachs-2016:a}, obtaining stellar masses at the 1\\% level is crucial for astrophysics.  Accounting for $\\Delta V_B$ made it possible to reach that level of precision (and hopefully of accuracy as well) for $\\alpha$ Cen without any ad-hoc assumption over a so short timescale.  The revised distance and masses match the values independently derived by astroseismology.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nWe thank the referee, Xavier Dumusque, for his suggestion about filtering the HARPS dataset according to the seeing.
