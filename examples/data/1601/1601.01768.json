The literature provides a huge collection of results for most of which the number of colors is implicit. Here, we intend to explore choosability and list coloring issues in which the number of available colors (denoted by $k$ in the sequel) is fixed. To our knowledge, this idea was introduced in~\\cite{cogis} and~\\cite{ganjali} and further studied in particular in~\\cite{kral} and more recently in~\\cite{kang} where the set of available colors is called the spectrum.  It turns out that limiting the size of the spectrum provides some original and unexpected results. We shall derive below some results in this direction, in particular related to complexity.\n\nThe motivation for such research originates in some types of scheduling problems. A time interval of length $k$ is divided into $k$ unit time periods. We have a collection $V$ of tasks with unit processing times to schedule in this time interval. Each task $v$ to be scheduled has a collection $L(v)$ of possible time periods for its processing and should be assigned to exactly one period in the list $L(v)$, while taking into account a set $E$ of pairwise incompatibilities between tasks: some pairs of tasks cannot be processed during the same period because they may use a common resource (like a machine). It is reasonable in many such applications to assume that the total number of possible periods is fixed to some value $k$. \n\nMore formally, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $K=\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$ of colors. Each vertex $v$ is associated with a list $L(v)\\subseteq K$ of possible colors. We denote such data by $(G,L)$ where $L$ will be called a list assignment, or list system. One has to find whether there is a vertex $k$-coloring $G$ which gives to each vertex $v$ a color $c(v)\\in L(v)$ in such a way that $c(u)\\neq c(v)$ for every edge $uv\\in E$. Such a coloring is a {\\em list $k$-coloring}.  \n\nAn interesting situation occurs when the size of lists are all equal to a fixed constant $\\ell$; this happens in particular when one allows a fixed number of time preferences for each task to give more flexibility in the construction of the schedule. In this work we are interested in finding  whether or not such a coloring exists for any list system $L$ satisfying $|L(v)|=\\ell$ for each $v\\in V$. This property is particularly relevant since it  indicates that whatever the lists will be, it will be possible to find a feasible schedule. Then this schedule can be built using other criteria than the strict limitation of available colors. This can also be a meaningful information when deciding the number $\\ell$ of alternatives to be chosen for each task.\n\n\nAfter recalling some basic results on choosability and list colorings in Section~\\ref{sec:notations}, we exhibit in Section~\\ref{sec:polynomial} some classes of choosable graphs for which   list colorings can be constructed in polynomial time. We discuss complexity issues in Sections~\\ref{sec:remarks} \nand~\\ref{sec:hardness}. Then  in Section~\\ref{sec:kk+1} we will examine the behavior of choosability properties when the number of available colors is modified. \nFinally, Section~\\ref{sec:conclusion} will present concluding remarks as well as perspectives for further research.\n\n\\section{Notations}\\label{sec:notations} \n\nAll graphs considered in this work are simple and finite.\nGiven a graph $G$, a vertex $k$-coloring assigns to every vertex $v$ a color $c(v)\\in\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$ with $c(u)\\neq c(v)$ for every edge $uv\\in E$.\nGiven a graph $G$ and a list assignment $L$ with color set $K$ ($k=|K|)$, a list $k$-coloring is a $k$-coloring such that each vertex gets a color in its list. $L$ is {\\em feasible} if there is a list $k$-coloring for $L$ while it is {\\em infeasible} in the opposite case.\nGiven a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a function $f: V\\longrightarrow {\\mathbb N}$, an $f$-list assignment $L$ is a list assignment satisfying $|L(v)|=f(v), \\forall v\\in V$. \nFor an edge $uv$, $G\\setminus \\{uv\\}$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by removing $uv$ from the edge set. We will denote the neighborhood of a vertex $u$ by $\\Gamma(u)$. For a set of vertices $X$, $G[X]$ denotes the subgraph of $G$ induced by $X$. A set of vertices is {\\em stable} if it consists of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. A {clique} $K_m$ is a complete graph on $m$ vertices; $K_{p,q}$ denotes a complete bipartite graph with parts of size $p$ and $q$ and $K_{p,q,r}$ denotes a complete tripartite graph with parts of size $p$, $q$ and $r$. $C_i$  denotes a cycle of size $i$. We denote by $G(p,q)$ the grid-graph (or shortly grid) of size $p\\times q$ with vertex set $V = ((x_i,y_j) i = 1 \\dots p; j = 1, \\dots q)$ where $x_i = i,y_j = j$ for all $i,j$ and edge set\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "$$\n\\begin{array}{lllll}\nE = & \\{ \\left[ (x_i,y_j),(x_i,y_{j+1}) \\right] & i = 1, \\dots,p; & j = 1, \\dots, q- 1 \\} & \\bigcup \\\\\n & \\{ \\left[ (x_i,y_j),(x_{i+1},y_j) \\right] & i = 1, \\dots,q-1; & j = 1, \\dots, q \\}  &  \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\begin{array}[]{lllll}E=&amp;\\{\\left[(x_{i},y_{j}),(x_{i},y_{j+1})\\right]&amp;i=1,%&#10;\\dots,p;&amp;j=1,\\dots,q-1\\}&amp;\\bigcup\\\\&#10;&amp;\\{\\left[(x_{i},y_{j}),(x_{i+1},y_{j})\\right]&amp;i=1,\\dots,q-1;&amp;j=1,\\dots,q\\}&amp;\\\\&#10;\\end{array}\" display=\"block\"><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi/></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>y</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>y</mi><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>;</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>q</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mo largeop=\"true\" mathsize=\"160%\" movablelimits=\"false\" stretchy=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u22c3</mo></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd/><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>y</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>y</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>;</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mtd><mtd/></mtr></mtable></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01768.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nWe assume that colors in each list $L(v)$ are distinct and consequently that $k\\geq \\max (f(v), v\\in V)$.\nA graph is {\\em $f$-choosable} (resp. {\\em $\\ell$-choosable}) if it is $[f,k]$-choosable for any $k\\geq \\max (f(v), v\\in V)$ (resp. if it is $[\\ell,k]$-choosable for any $k\\geq \\ell$) and similarly a bipartite graph is  $(p,q)$-choosable if it is $[(p,q),k]$-choosable for any $k\\geq \\max(p,q)$.

Notice that with such a definition, choosability with $k$ colors does not imply choosability with $k-1$ colors. Consider for instance a two-edge path on vertices $x,y,z$; it would be 1-choosable if $|L(x)\\cup L(y)\\cup L(z)|=3$ while it is trivially not 1-choosable with only two colors.\n\nThe same notation was used in~\\cite{kral} for a concept identical with our definition of $[\\ell,k]$-choosability.

We will in particular examine how choosability properties of their blocks can be extended to the entire graph and we will show that the related list coloring problem can be solved in polynomial time. \nWe recall that a {\\em block} in a graph is a maximal connected subgraph without cut vertex (a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph). Note that with this definition, a cut edge is a block.\n\nA graph will be called {\\em ideally} $[\\ell,k]$-choosable if for any \n$\\ell$-list assignment with colors in $\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$, it is always possible to choose an arbitrary vertex $v_0$, to assign any color $c\\in L(v_0)$ to $v_0$ and extend the list coloring to the entire  $G$. \n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: block}\nAssume in a (connected) graph $G$ all blocks but one are ideally $[\\ell,k]$-choosable (resp. $\\ell$-choosable) and the last one is $[\\ell,k]$-choosable (resp. $\\ell$-choosable), then $G$ itself is $[\\ell,k]$-choosable (resp. $\\ell$-choosable).\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $B_1, \\ldots, B_b$ be the blocks of $G$, where $B_2, \\ldots, B_b$ are ideally $[\\ell,k]$-choosable (resp. $\\ell$-choosable) and $B_1$ is $[\\ell,k]$-choosable (resp. $\\ell$-choosable). $B_2, \\ldots, B_b$ are ordered in such a way that, for any $j, 2\\leq j\\leq b$, $B_j$ has exactly one vertex, say $v_j$, with $v_j\\in B_1\\cup \\ldots \\cup B_{j-1}$. Such a numbering can always be found.\n\nConsider any list assignment. A suitable coloring can always be constructed for $B_1$ from the assumptions. Now, having found a suitable coloring for the vertices of $B_1\\cup \\ldots \\cup B_{j-1}$ $(j\\geq 2)$ we impose the color $c(v_j)$ given to vertex $v_j\\in B_1\\cup \\ldots \\cup B_{j-1}$ and since $B_j$ is ideally $[\\ell,k]$-choosable (resp. $\\ell$-choosable) we can extend the list coloring to the vertices of $B_j$. By repeating this until the vertices of $B_b$ are colored, we get a suitable coloring of $G$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\\label{rem:blocks}\nSince the blocks of a graph can be found in $O(|E|)$~\\cite{gondran}  with the associated tree, we obtain the following consequence of the proof of Proposition~\\ref{prop: block}.\n\nLet ${\\cal C}$ be a class of 2-connected graphs which are ideally $[\\ell,k]$-choosable (resp. $\\ell$-choosable) and for which $[\\ell,k]$-LISTCOL (resp. $\\ell$--LISTCOL) is polynomial. Then $[\\ell,k]$-LISTCOL (resp. $\\ell$--LISTCOL) is polynomial for the class of graphs whose blocks are in ${\\cal C}$.\n\\end{rmk}\n\nLine-perfect graphs have been defined as graphs having no (elementary) odd cycle larger than~3. These are precisely the graphs $G$ for which the line graph $L(G)$ is perfect~\\cite{trotter-line-perfect}. They are characterized by the fact that their blocks are isomorphic to $K_4$, $K_{1,1,p}$ or any 2-connected bipartite graph~\\cite{maffray}.\n\n\\begin{claim}\\label{claim: A}\nA bipartite graph is ideally $[3,4]$-choosable and $[3,4]$-LISTCOL can be solved in $O(|V|)$. \n\\end{claim}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G=(B\\cup W, E)$ be a bipartite graph, assume $v\\in B$, choose $c\\in L(v)$; we can color all vertices in $B$ using at most two colors $c,c'$, $v$ receiving color $c$. Since $|L(u)|=3$ for each $u\\in W$, we can find in $L(u)$ a color $c(u)\\neq c,c'$ and we are done. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{claim: C}\nLet $G$ be a graph with an order  $v_1, \\ldots, v_n$ of its vertices and the related acyclic orientation of its edges ($v_iv_j$ oriented from $v_i$ to $v_j$ if $i<j$). Let $d^-_G(v_i)$ be the number of arcs entering in $v_i$, $i=1, \\ldots, n$. Consider  a list assignment $L$ with colors in $\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$. If  $\\forall i=1, \\ldots, n, |L(v_i)|\\geq d^-_G(v_i)+1$, then for any choice of color $c\\in L(v_1)$ for $v_1$, there is a list $k$-coloring with $v_1$ colored $c$. It can be constructed in linear time.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\n$v_1$ is colored $c$; consider vertices in the order $v_2, \\ldots, v_n$ and color $v_i$ with the first available color in $L(v_i)$ (not used for coloring its predecessors in the order). This is always possible by the assumptions. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{coro}~\\label{cor:acyclic}\nIf $G=K_{1,1,p}$ ($p\\geq 2$) or $G=C_{2p+1}$ (odd cycle, $p\\geq 1$), then $G$ is ideally $[3,4]$-choosable and $[3,4]$-LISTCOL can be solved in $O(|V|)$.\n\\end{coro}\n\\begin{proof}\nIf $G$ is an odd cycle of size $n=2p+1$, then there is an acyclic orientation such that $\\forall i=1, \\ldots, n$, $d^-_G(v_i)\\leq 2$. One can furthermore choose any vertex to be of rank~0. For $G=K_{1,1,p}$ with $p\\geq 2$, of size $n=p+2$, let $a,b$ be the two vertices of degree $p$ (outside of the stable of size $p$) and choose any vertex $v_1$ with rank~0. If $v_1\\notin \\{a,b\\}$, then choose $a$ as $v_2$ and $b$ as $v_3$; else, if $v_1=a$ we set $v_2=b$. In both cases, number all other vertices in any order and orient each edge $v_iv_j, i<j$ from $i$ to $j$. We also have $\\forall i=1, \\ldots, n$, $d^-_G(v_i)\\leq 2$. \nUsing Proposition~\\ref{claim: C}, we conclude that $K_{1,1,p}$ and $C_{2p+1}$ are ideally $[3,4]$-choosable. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{coro}\\label{claim: B}\nA graph  $G$ of maximum degree $\\Delta$ is ideally $(\\Delta+1)$-choosable. In particular a clique $K_n$ is ideally $n$-choosable.\n\\end{coro}\n\\begin{proof}\nGiven $G$, a $(\\Delta+1)$-list assignment and an arbitrary vertex $v_1$, then by taking any order $v_1, \\ldots, v_n$ and the corresponding  orientation, the result follows from Proposition~\\ref{claim: C}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe immediately deduce from Corollary~\\ref{claim: B} and Proposition~\\ref{prop: block}:\n\n\\begin{coro}\nConsider a graph $G$ and let $D$ be the maximum degree of its blocks, then $G$ is $(D+1)$-choosable.\n\\end{coro}\n\nWe call {\\em quasi line-perfect} a graph whose blocks are isomorphic to $K_4$, a 2-connected bipartite graph, $K_{1,1,p}$ or an odd cycle $C_{2p+1}, (p\\geq 2)$. \n\nNote in particular that line-perfect graphs and cacti (blocks are cycles) are quasi line-perfect.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\mbox{}\\\\\n(i) A quasi-line perfect graph is 4-choosable and 4-LISTCOL is solvable in $O(|E|)$.\\\\\n(ii) A 3-colorable quasi-line perfect graph is $[3,4]$-choosable and $[3,4]$-LISTCOL is solvable in $O(|E|)$.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThis follows immediately from Corollaries~\\ref{claim: A} and~\\ref{claim: B} and Proposition~\\ref{prop: block}, noticing that 3-colorable quasi-line perfect graphs are exactly graphs whose blocks are isomorphic to a 2-connected bipartite graph, $K_{1,1,p}$ or an odd cycle $C_{2p+1}, (p\\geq 2)$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe also mention that {\\em{ block-cactus}} graphs have been defined as graphs whose blocks are either cliques or cycles of length at least \nfour~\\cite{block-cactus}. We derive the following:\n\n\\begin{prop}\nLet $G$ be a block-cactus graph, let $p$ be the maximum size of a clique in $G$. Then $G$ is $\\max(p,3)$-choosable if there is a block which is an odd cycle or $\\max(p,2)$-choosable otherwise.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\n\\section{Some remarks about the complexity of choosability and list coloring}\\label{sec:remarks} \n\nWe may wonder whether one problem among $[\\ell, k]$-CH (resp. $\\ell$-CH) and $[\\ell, k]$-LISTCOL (resp. $\\ell$-LISTCOL) is more difficult than the other in terms of complexity. It turns out that it is not the case. There are indeed classes of instances where one of the problems is polynomially solvable while the other one is NP-hard. \n\nConsider the class ${\\cal H}$ of subgrids containing a chocolate. Such a subgrid is trivially non $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-choosable since a chocolate itself is already non $[2,3]$-choosable (see~\\cite{rubin} and Section~\\ref{sec:kk+1} below). Consequently $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-CH is trivially polynomial on the class ${\\cal H}$ (the answer is NO for any of these instances) while we have shown in~\\cite{grids}\n that $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-LISTCOL is NP-complete on subgrids of maximum degree~3 and the same result trivially holds on the class ${\\cal H}$. \n\nSimilarly, in~\\cite{grids} we have given a subgraph of $G(9,9)$ with 41 vertices that is not $[(2,3),4]$-choosable and shown that $[(2,3),4]$-LISTCOL is NP-complete in grids and in particular in grids $G(p,q), p,q\\geq 9$.  The same  argument as previously shows that $[(2,3),4]$-CH is trivial for this class. \n\nThe following proposition provides an example of the reverse situation:\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: co-np}\nThere is a class ${\\cal J}$ of graphs with known chromatic number $\\chi$ for which $[\\{\\chi-2,\\chi-1, \\chi\\},\\chi]$-LISTCOL is polynomial while $[\\{\\chi-2,\\chi-1, \\chi\\},\\chi]$-CH is co-NP-complete.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig_hyper}\n\\caption{A 2-colorable hypergraph $(X,F)$.}\n\\label{fig:hyper}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fig_CH-LCOL}\n\\caption{The graph associated with $(X,F)$ of Figure~\\ref{fig:hyper} and the related infeasible list assignment. }\n\\label{fig:CH-LCOL}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe will use  Hypergraph 2-colorability (also called Set Splitting): any instance is defined by an hypergraph $(X,F)$ with vertex set $X=\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$ and hyperedge set $F=\\{f_1, \\ldots, f_m\\}, f_i\\subset X, i=1, \\ldots m$; the question is whether there is a 2-coloring of $X$  such that no hyperedge is monochromatic. It is known to be NP-complete even if hyperedges are of size at most~3~\\cite{gj}.\n\nLet $(X,F)$ be such an instance with $n$ vertices and $m$ hyperedges. \nWe consider the graph $G=(V,E)$ defined as follows: $V=V_0\\cup V_F\\cup V_X\\cup V_S$, $V_0=\\{v_0^0, v_0^1, \\ldots, v_0^{m}\\}$ induces a clique $K_{m+1}$, $V_F=\\{v_2^{f_1}, \\ldots, v_2^{f_m}\\} $ induces a clique $K_m$, $V_X=\\{v_X^{x_1}, \\ldots v_X^{x_n}\\}$  and $V_S=\\{v_S^1, \\ldots, v_S^{\\binom{m+1}{2}-1}\\}$. $V_X\\cup V_S$ induces a stable set. We have in $E$ additional edges:  all edges between $v_0^2, \\ldots, v_0^{m}$ and $V_X\\cup V_S$, all edges between $v_0^0$ and $V_F$ and edges $v_F^{f_i}v_X^{x_j}$ for every vertex $x_j$ in $f_i$, $i\\in\\{1, \\ldots m\\}$. Finally vertices in $V_X$ will have $m$-lists, those in $V_S$ have $(m-1)$-lists and all other vertices $(m+1)$-lists. Let ${\\cal J}$ be the class of such graphs.\n\n$G$ can be constructed in polynomial time and it is straightforward to verify that its chromatic number is $\\chi(G)=m+1$. There is indeed a clique of size $m+1$ and moreover an $(m+1)$-coloring can be obtained  as follows:  color vertex $v_0^i$ with color $i\\in \\{0, \\ldots, m\\}$, vertex $v_F^{f_i}$ with color $i\\in\\{1, \\ldots m\\}$ and vertices in $V_X\\cup V_S$ with  0. \n\nSince $|V_S|=\\binom{m+1}{2}-1$, there is a one-to-one correspondence between $V_S$ and the set of pairs of colors taken among $\\{0, \\ldots, m\\}$, except the pair $\\{0,1\\}$; we denote by $(s_i,t_i)$ the pair corresponding to $i\\in \\{1, \\ldots, \\binom{m+1}{2}-1\\}$.\n\n\\vspace{0,5 cm}\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:hyper} gives an instance $(X,F)$ of Hypergraph 2-colorability with $n=5, m=4$. It is a 2-colorable hypergraph as shown by the black \\& white coloring of $X=\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$. Figure~\\ref{fig:CH-LCOL} illustrates the construction of $G$ for the example of Figure~\\ref{fig:hyper}. This graph is not $[\\{3,4,5\\},5]$-choosable as illustrated by the related infeasible list assignment which will be defined below. In this figure,  $V_X\\cup V_F$ is directly identified with $X\\cup F$ and vertices in $V_S$ are identified by  pairs of colors different from $(0,1)$, the black color is associated with 1 and the white one with 0. Finally, curved dashed lines indicate a complete link between two sets of vertices.\n\n\\vspace{0,5 cm}\n\nSuppose that $(X,F)$ is 2-colorable and consider a feasible 2-coloring with colors 0 and 1. We then define a list system as follows: for every $i\\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$, we take  $L(v_X^{x_i})= \\{\\theta_i\\}\\cup\\{2, \\ldots m\\}$, where $\\theta_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$ is the color of $x_i$ in the 2-coloring of $(X,F)$.  For vertices in $V_S$ we define $L(v_S^i)=\\{0, \\ldots, m\\}\\setminus\\{s_i,t_i\\})$. In particular $L(v_S^i)$ contains at least one color among 0 and 1.  All other vertices have the list $\\{0, \\ldots, m\\}$. In any feasible list coloring of $G[V_0\\cup V_X\\cup V_S]$ only two colors can be used for coloring $V_X\\cup V_S$  and the list system of $V_S$ imposes that these two colors are necessarily 0 and 1. Consequently, any vertex in $V_X$ gets the same color as in the 2-coloring of $(X,F)$. Then at least one vertex  $v\\in V_F$ should be colored either with 0 or 1 and since there is no monochromatic hyperedge, $v$ has two neighbors colored 0 and 1, a contradiction.  Consequently this list system is not feasible, proving that $G$ is not choosable.\n\n\\vspace{0,5 cm}\n\nSuppose conversely that $G$ is not choosable for the above list sizes (i.e. $(m-1)$ in $V_S$, $m$ in $V_X$ and $(m+1)$ elsewhere) and consider an infeasible list system. Every vertex in $V_S$ has exactly two forbidden colors among $\\{0, \\ldots, m\\}$  and since the total number of pairs of colors is  $\\binom{m+1}{2}=|V_S|+1$ it is possible to find two colors for list coloring vertices in $V_S$. The same colors can be used for vertices in $V_X$ since each one has only one forbidden color.\nLet us denote by $i,j$ the two colors used for coloring $V_X\\cup V_S$. Color $v_0^2, \\ldots, v_0^m$ with colors in $\\{0, \\ldots, m\\}\\setminus \\{i,j\\}$. Consider $v\\in V_F$; if all its neighbors in $V_X$ are colored with the same color, say $i$, then it would be possible to extend the list coloring to the whole graph, choosing color $i$ for $v_0^0$,  color $j$ for $v_0^1$ and colors in $\\{0, \\ldots, m+1\\}\\setminus\\{i,j\\}$ for the vertices in $V_F\\setminus \\{v\\}$, a contradiction with the fact that the list assignment is not feasible. \nHence every $v\\in V_F$ has a neighbor colored with $i$ in $V_X$ and one colored with $j$, this means that the coloring of $V_X$ defines a feasible 2-coloring of $(X,F)$. Hence, $(X,F)$ is 2-colorable if and only if $G$ is not choosable. \n\nNote finally that, given any list assignment with the corresponding list sizes, it can be checked in polynomial time whether $G$ is list colorable. Indeed, for every pair of colors $\\{i,j\\}$ among $\\{0, \\ldots, m\\}$, one can color $v_0^0$ with $i$ and $v_0^1$ with $j$, then for every vertex in $V_F$, it suffices to check whether its neighbors can be colored with $i$ and, in this case, whether this coloring can be extended to $V_X\\cup V_S$, using only colors $i$ and $j$. If so, the graph is list colorable. If this is not possible for any pair $\\{i,j\\}$ and any vertex in $V_S$, $G$ is not list colorable. This shows that \n$[\\{\\chi-2,\\chi-1, \\chi\\},\\chi]$-LISTCOL is polynomial in ${\\cal J}$. \n\nMoreover this also shows that $[\\{\\chi-2,\\chi-1, \\chi\\},\\chi]$-CH is co-NP in the class ${\\cal J}$ and consequently, the previous reduction shows that it is co-NP-complete.\n\\end{proof}\n\nNote that, in general, $[\\ell,k]$-CH does not a priori belong to NP $\\cup$ co-NP but is in the class $\\Pi_2^p$ (see~\\cite{papadimitriou} for definitions related to complexity theory). Indeed, to check whether a fixed graph is choosable (with given list sizes), one has to check for any list system satisfying size constraints  whether the related LISTCOL instance is satisfiable, a problem in NP.\n\nIn very special cases we may have  choosability problems which are in NP (see Proposition~\\ref{prop: 2,3-choos 3 col}) or in co-NP (see Proposition~\\ref{prop: co-np})\n\n\n\\section{Hardness of $[\\ell,k]$-choosability}\\label{sec:hardness} \n\n2-choosability has been completely characterized in~\\cite{rubin} and in fact, it turns out from the proof, since all obstructions used need at most four colors,  that a graph is 2-choosable if and only if it is $[2,4]$-choosable; this is also mentioned in~\\cite{kral}. $[2, 2]$-choosability corresponds to 2-colorability. To settle the case $\\ell = 2$, we need to characterize $[2,3]$-choosable graphs. A simple adaptation of the proof in~\\cite{rubin} gives the following proposition. The {\\em core} of a graph is the subgraph obtained by repeatedly  removing a vertex of degree~1 together with its incident edge until the graph contains only isolated vertices and vertices of degree at least~2;  we denote by $\\theta_{2,2,2m}$  the graph consisting of 3 vertex disjoint paths of  length $2,2,2m$ between two vertices.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: 2-3-choos}\nA graph is $[2,3]$-choosable if and only if its core belongs to\\\\ $\\{K_1, C_{2m+2}, \\theta_{2,2,2m}, K_{2,m}, m\\in {I\\hspace{-0.3em}N}\\}$\n\\end{prop}\n\nIf list sizes are either 2 or 3,  \nnote that $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-CH is hard in planar graphs and in triangle-free graphs since 3-COL, equivalent to $[3,3]$-CH, is already hard in these classes~(\\cite{gj}; \\cite{maffray-triangle-free}). \n\nIt has been shown in~\\cite{grids} that bipartite graphs are $[(2,3),3]$-choosable. The following proposition points out hard cases when list sizes are only required to be in $\\{2,3\\}$: \n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: 2,3-choos 3 col}\\mbox\\\\\n\n(i) $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-CH is NP-complete in bipartite graphs, even if there are only 6 vertices with 2-lists and they induce a $C_6$.\\\\\n(ii) $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-CH is polynomial in bipartite graphs if there are 6 vertices with 2-lists and they do not induce a $C_6$.\\\\\n(iii) Every bipartite graph is $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-choosable if at most 5 vertices have 2-lists.\n\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n{\\bf (i)}.\nMembership to NP is clear since under the hypotheses  there are only $3^6$ different list systems; for each one of them one needs to  guess a coloring and check whether it is a feasible list coloring. If the answer is Yes, then the graph is choosable, else it is not. The reduction is made from 3-color Pre-Ext in bipartite graphs defined as follows: an instance is a bipartite graph $G=(B\\cup W,E)$ with three specified vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3$ in $B$. The question is whether there is a 3-coloring of $G$ such that $v_1, v_2$ and $v_3$ get different colors. This problem was shown NP-complete in~\\cite{bojawoe94}. \n\nConsider an instance of 3-color Pre-Ext consisting in a bipartite graph $G=(B\\cup W,E)$ and three vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}\\subset B$. We add three vertices $u_1, u_2, u_3$ in $W$ and edges $v_1u_1$, $u_1v_2$, $v_2u_2$, $u_2v_3$, $v_3u_3$ and $u_3v_1$. We denote by $C$ the cycle $v_1,u_1,v_2,u_2,v_3,u_3$. The resulting bipartite graph $G'$ is seen as an instance of $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-CH, where vertices in $C$ have 2-lists and all others have 3-lists. \n\nSuppose that the instance $(G, \\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\})$ is satisfiable for 3-color Pre-Ext; we shall prove that $G'$ is $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-choosable  if vertices of $C$ are the only vertices with 2-lists. Consider a 2-list assignment to vertices of $C$ in $G'$. Since $C$ is $[2,3]$-choosable (see Proposition~\\ref{prop: 2-3-choos}) it has a list 3-coloring. If $v_1,v_2, v_3$ are colored with one or two colors, then this list coloring can be extended to  $G'$ by coloring $W$ with the third color. If they are colored using three colors then this coloring can be extended to $G'$ using the fact that $(G, \\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\})$ is satisfiable. \n\nSuppose conversely that $(G, \\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\})$ is not satisfiable and consider the following 2-list assignment for $C$: $L(v_1)=\\{1,2\\}$, $L(u_1)=\\{2,3\\}$, \n$L(v_2)=\\{1,3\\}$, $L(u_2)=\\{1,2\\}$, $L(v_3)=\\{2,3\\}$, $L(u_3)=\\{1,3\\}$. It is straightforward to verify that in any list coloring of $C$ $v_1, v_2$ and $v_3$ are colored using three colors and consequently it cannot be extended to the whole graph $G'$. This shows that in this case $G'$ is not choosable and concludes the proof of {\\bf (i)}.\n\n{\\bf (ii)} and {\\bf (iii)}.\nConsider an instance  $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-CH and denote by $H$ the subgraph induced by vertices with 2-lists. Then the instance can be written $(G,H)$ where $G=(B\\cup W, E)$ and $H=(B_H\\cup W_H, E_H)$ with $B_H\\subset B$ and $W_H\\subset W$. Suppose that $|B_H\\cup W_H|\\leq 6$  and $H$ is not a $C_6$. \nConsider any list assignment with 2-lists on $B_H\\cup W_H$ and 3-lists elsewhere. If $|B_H|\\leq 2$ then it will be possible to color $B$ with a single color and $W$ with the two other colors; the same holds symmetrically if $|W_H|\\leq 2$. In particular, this holds if $|B_H\\cup W_H|\\leq 5$, proving {\\bf (iii)}. It remains to consider the case where $|B_H|=|W_H|=3$. Suppose first that there is in $H$ a vertex $u$ of degree  $d_H(u)\\leq 1$; w.l.o.g. we can suppose $u\\in W_H$. We can color with one single color $W\\setminus \\{u\\}$ since it contains only two vertices with 2-lists. Then it is possible to color  $(B\\setminus B_H)\\cup \\Gamma (u)$ where $\\Gamma(\\cdot)$ denotes the neighborhood. Every vertex in $B_H\\setminus (\\Gamma(u)\\cap B_H)$ has a monochromatic neighborhood and the same holds for $u$; consequently we can extend this list coloring to the whole graph.  Suppose now that every vertex in $H$ has a degree at least 2. Since \n$|B_H|=|W_H|=3$, $H$ contains a $C_6$ as a partial subgraph. Since $H$ is not a $C_6$, this cycle has a chord which means that $H$ contains a chocolate as a partial subgraph. Thus, $H$ is not $[2,3]$-choosable and $G$ is not choosable. As a conclusion,  to decide whether $G$ is $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-choosable we just have to detect whether $H$ contains a vertex of degree at most~1, which can be done in polynomial time. This concludes the proof of {\\bf (ii)}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn~\\cite{rubin}, it is shown that $\\{2,3\\}$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in bipartite graphs of maximum degree~4.\nIn~\\cite{gutner}, the proof is adapted to show that $\\{2,3\\}$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree~5. The proof can  be adapted by reducing the number of colors used from $k=7$ to $k=4$  to show that $[\\{2,3\\},4]$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in planar bipartite graphs of degree~5. In what follows, we  improve the reduction to obtain a result on subgrids using only three colors. Notice that, in the next result, even if $k$ is fixed to~3, we cannot expect membership in NP: the argument used in Proposition~\\ref{prop: 2,3-choos 3 col} shows that $[\\{2,3\\},3]$-CH is in NP as long as the number of 2-lists is bounded by a constant.\n\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: 2,3-choos 4 col grids}\nFor any $k\\geq 3$, $[\\{2,3\\},k]$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in subgrids.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nMembership in $\\Pi_2^p$ is clear, as a particular case of the general choosability problem. As in the proof of~\\cite{gutner}, our reduction uses the Restricted Planar Satisfiability (RPS), shown to be $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in~\\cite{gutner}. An instance ${\\cal I}$ is an expression of the form $\\forall U_1 \\cdots \\forall U_k \\exists V_1 \\cdots \\exists V_r \\Phi$, where $\\Phi$ is a formula in conjunctive normal form over the variables $\\{U_1, \\ldots, U_s, V_1, \\ldots, V_t\\}$, each clause contains exactly three literals (either a variable or its opposite), each variable occurs in at most three clauses, and the bipartite graph $\\Gamma_{\\Phi}$ with clauses in one part and variables in the other part, linking a clause to the three variables it involves, is planar. The question is whether the expression is true or not, which means that, for all truth assignment of variables $U_i$, $i=1, \\ldots, s$ (referred as {\\em $\\forall$-variables}) there is a truth assignment of variables $V_j$, $j=1, \\ldots, t$ (referred as {\\em $\\exists$-variables}) such that each clause contains at least one true literal.\n\nGiven an instance ${\\cal I}$ of RPS, we need to construct in polynomial time a subgrid $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}=(V,E)$ and a function $f:V\\rightarrow \\{2,3\\}$ such that   ${\\cal I}$ is satisfiable if and only if $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ is $[f,k]$-choosable, $k\\geq 3$. For readability purposes, we will  only give below the construction of $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}=(V,E)$, which is different from ~\\cite{rubin} and~\\cite{gutner} and we will use the following lemma whose proof is given in appendix since the arguments are similar to those of~\\cite{rubin} and~\\cite{gutner}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig_half_propagator}\n\\caption{The gadget $P_{1/2}$ with a list assignment for which imposing color $0$ at $I$ imposes color $0$ at $O'$.}\n\\label{fig:half-propagator}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig_propagators.pdf}\n\\caption{Two gadgets $P_1$ and $P_2$ linked by a two-edge path.}\n\\label{fig:propagators}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{fig_forall}\n\\caption{The gadget associated with a $\\forall$-variable $U_i$. }\n\\label{fig:forall}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{lem_annex} \\mbox{}\\\\\n(i) if ${\\cal I}$ is satisfiable, then $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ is $f$-choosable.\\\\\n(ii) if $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ is $[f,3]$-choosable, then ${\\cal I}$ is satisfiable.\n\\end{lem}\n\nThis will conclude the proof. \n\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that, in ${\\cal I}$, every variable appears at least once in positive form and once in negative form and consequently, each literal has either 1 or 2 occurrences in the expression $\\Phi$. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use gadgets which have similar properties to those in~\\cite{rubin} and~\\cite{gutner}, but which can be embedded in a grid.  The main gadget, called, {\\em half propagator} in the previous proofs is replaced by the graph $P_{1/2}$ in Figure~\\ref{fig:half-propagator}. Vertex $I$ is  the {\\em Input} while $O'$ is  the {\\em Output}. In $P_{1/2}$, we also specify two vertices $a,b$ as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:half-propagator}. \n\nA propagator $P$ consists of two gadgets $P_{1/2}$, glued by identifying  the Output of the first one and the Input of the second one. We then call $I$ the Input of the first $P_{1/2}$ and $O$ the Output of the second one, they form respectively the Input and the Output of the gadget $P$ (see Figure~\\ref{fig:propagators}). We also define the function $f_P$ that associates value 3 with $O', O$ and the four vertices $a_1,b_1, a_2, b_2$. Two such gadgets $P_1, P_2$ may be connected by a two-edge path between the Output of $P_1$ and the Input of  $P_2$ (see Figure~\\ref{fig:propagators}). \nWe define $f_{P_{1/2}}(x)=3$ for $x\\in\\{a,b,O'\\}$ and $f_{P_{1/2}}(x)=2$ for other vertices of $P_{1/2}$. \n\nWe then consider the planar bipartite graph $\\Gamma_{\\Phi}$. Every vertex associated with a $\\exists$-variable $V_j$ is replaced by two vertices $v_j,\\bar v_j$ (one per literal) linked by an edge. Every vertex associated with a  $\\forall$-variable $U_i$, $i=1, \\ldots, s$ is replaced by four vertices $u_i,\\bar u_i, u'_i, u''_i$ with edges such that $u_i,u'_i,\\bar u_i,u''_i$ is a $C_4$ (see Figure~\\ref{fig:forall}). These two first gadgets are called {\\em variable gadgets} with a specific vertex associated with each literal. Consider a literal $W$  and its related vertex $w$; if $W$ has two occurrences in the expression $\\Phi$, then we connect to  $w$ two gadgets $P$ separated by a two-edge path  by identifying the vertex $w$ with the vertex $I$ of the first gadget $P$. We then denote by  $M$ the intermediate vertex between the two consecutive $P$'s.  If $W$ has a single occurrence in $\\Phi$, then we connect to $w$ a single gadget $P$ by identifying $w$ and $I$. Each variable  is then associated with a subgrid with two or  three Output vertices (one by occurrence of the variable in $\\Phi$) all situated on the external face of this subgrid and two Input vertices. Replacing in $\\Gamma_{\\Phi}$ the vertex associated with this variable by the related subgrid, it is possible to connect the three clause vertices linked to this variable in $\\Gamma_{\\Phi}$ to the related Output vertices without edge crossing. Let $E'$ be the collection of these new edges. The resulting graph $\\Gamma'_{\\Phi}$ remains planar. Then it is possible to embed $\\Gamma'_{\\Phi}$ in a grid such that each edge in $E'$ is replaced by a path called  {\\em connection path}. This is possible since the degree of Output vertices is at most~4. Without loss of generality we can assume that connection paths contain at least two edges. Moreover the connection paths can be drawn in such a way that the resulting graph $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ is a subgrid. \n\nFunction $f$ is obtained by associating the value~3 to vertices $a,b, O', O$ in gadgets $P$. Clause vertices are also associated with~3 and all other vertices get the value~2. In particular, the function $f_P$ is the restriction of $f$ to the related gadget $P$.\n\nThis completes the construction that can be performed in polynomial time.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{coro}\nFor any $k\\geq 5$, $[\\{2,3, 5\\},k]$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in grids.\n\\end{coro}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nStarting from  $({\\cal S}, f_{\\cal S})$, instance of $[\\{2,3\\},k]$-CH , where ${\\cal S}$ is a subgrid, we embed ${\\cal S}$ into a grid ${\\cal G}$ and define $f_{\\cal G}$ which extends $f_{\\cal S}$ to $V({\\cal G})$ by setting $f_{\\cal G}(v)=5\\ \\forall v\\in V({\\cal G})\\setminus V({\\cal S})$. Then ${\\cal S}$ is $[f_{\\cal S},k]$-choosable if and only if ${\\cal G}$ is $[f_{\\cal G},k]$-choosable. Indeed, we just need to show that, if ${\\cal S}$ is $[f_{\\cal S},k]$-choosable, then ${\\cal G}$ is $[f_{\\cal G},k]$-choosable. Considering any list $k$-coloring of ${\\cal S}$, we can color vertices in $V({\\cal G})\\setminus V({\\cal S})$ since ${\\cal G}$ is of maximum degree~4.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\vspace{0,5 cm}\n\nWe will point out several consequences of Proposition~\\ref{prop: 2,3-choos 4 col grids}. We need the following technical lemma:\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{lem: ff'}\nLet $H=(V_H,E_H)$ be a graph, $S_H\\subset V_H$ a stable set in $H$ and $f_H: V_H \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ a function.

Suppose first that $G$ is $[f,k]$-choosable and consider an $f'$-list assignment $L'$ for $G'$. We consider two cases:\n\n{\\underline{Case 1.}} Suppose $\\cap_{v\\in S_H}L'(v)\\neq \\emptyset$. We color $S_H$ with a single color $c\\in \\cap_{v\\in S_H}L'(v)$. Using hypothesis~\\ref{item: lemff'2}, this coloring can be extended to  a feasible list coloring in $V_H$. Removing $c$ from $L'(v_0)$ or any color if $c\\notin L(v_0)$, we can extend the list coloring to $V$ since $G$ is $[f,k]$-choosable.\n\n{\\underline{Case 2.}} If $\\cap_{v\\in S_H}L'(v)= \\emptyset$, then we first consider a list coloring of $G$; let $c$ be the color of $v_0$ and remove it from lists in $S_H$. Since at least one list in $S_H$ did not change, by using the fact that $H$ is $([f_H,k], S_H)$-critical, we can find a list $k$-coloring of $V_H$ without using $c$ in $S_H$, which shows that $G'$ is $[f',k]$-choosable. \n\nSuppose now that \n$G'$ is $[f',k]$-choosable and consider an $f$-list assignment $L$ of $G$. Since $H$ is $([f_H,k], S_H)$-critical, there is an infeasible $f_H$-list assignment $L_H$  such that $|\\cup_{v\\in S_H}L_H(v)|\\leq k-1$. Let $c\\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$ such that $c\\notin \\cup_{v\\in S_H}L_H(v)$; w.l.o.g.,  since $f(v_0)\\leq k-1$, by performing a circular permutation on colors we can suppose that $c\\notin L(v_0)$. We then add $c$ in $L_H(v), v\\in S_H$ and in $L(v_0)$ to get an $f'$-list assignment $L'$ for $G'$. $G'$ being $[f',k]$-choosable, there is a feasible list coloring and by property of the assignment $L_H$, at least one element in $S_H$ gets color $c$. Consequently the list coloring of $G'$ with respect to $L'$ defines a list coloring of $G$ with respect to $L$, which concludes the proof.  \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: 3-choos 4 col}\n$[3,4]$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in 3-colorable planar graphs of degree 7, $C_{2i+1}$-free for $i\\geq 4$ and such that every odd cycle $C_5$ or $C_7$ has 2 short chords.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig-3-choos-4col.pdf}\n\\caption{The gadget $H$ with infeasible $f_H$-list assignment.}\n\\label{fig: 3-choos 4 col}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nConsider the gadget $H$ in Figure~\\ref{fig: 3-choos 4 col}; it consists of two diamonds sharing a vertex of degree~2 denoted by $X$; we call $Y,Z$ the two other vertices of degree~2.\nWe apply Lemma~\\ref{lem: ff'} to $H$ with $S_H=\\{X,Y,Z\\}$ and $f_H(v)= 3, v\\notin S_H, f_H(X)=f_H(Y)=f_H(Z)=2$ and $k=4$. To show that $H$ is  $([f_H,4], S_H)$-critical we consider the $f_H$-list assignment in Figure~\\ref{fig: 3-choos 4 col}. Color 3 does not appear in $L_H(X)\\cup L_H(Y)\\cup L_H(Z)$ and it is straightforward to verify that it is infeasible. Suppose now that $X$ has a 3-list while $Y$ and $Z$ have a 2-list with colors in $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Suppose, without loss of generality, that $L_H(Y)= \\{1,2\\}$, then at least 2 colors in $L_H(X)$ can be used in a feasible list coloring of the diamond induced by $X$ and $Y$ in $H$. The same holds between $X$ and $Z$ implying that at least one color in $L_H(X)$ can be chosen such that the other vertices in $H$ can be colored. Suppose now that $|L_H(Y)|=3$, while $|L_H(X)|=|L_H(Z)|=2$. It is possible to find a feasible list coloring of the diamond induced by  $X$ and $Z$ in $H$ and then the three last vertices of $H$ can be colored greedily, $Y$ being the last one.  It is immediate to show that, if $X,Y,Z$ are colored with the same color, this list coloring can be completed if the four last vertices of $H$ are assigned to 3-lists. So, Lemma~\\ref{lem: ff'} applies.\n\nConsider now a \n planar bipartite graph $G$, instance of $[\\{2,3\\},4]$-CH and denote by $V^2, V^3$ the vertices of $G$ with lists of size 2 and 3, respectively. For every vertex in $v\\in V^2$, we add a gadget $H_v$ isomorphic to $H$  and link the related vertices $X_v,Y_v,Z_v$ to $v$. Let $\\tilde{G}$ be the resulting graph. $\\tilde{G}$ is planar, $C_{2i+1}$-free for $i\\geq 4$ and every odd cycle has 2 short chords. Using Lemma~\\ref{lem: ff'} for every $v\\in V^2$, we show that\n$\\tilde{G}$ is $[3,4]$-choosable if and only if $G$ is $[\\{2,3\\},4]$-choosable. Using Proposition~\\ref{prop: 2,3-choos 4 col grids} we conclude the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nAs pointed out in~\\cite{cogis}, every bipartite graph is $[3,4]$-choosable and moreover for $k\\leq 2(\\ell -1)$ every bipartite graph is $[\\ell,k]$-choosable. The problem turns out to be hard in bipartite graphs with a fifth color:\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: l-choos k col bip}\nFor every $\\ell\\geq 3$ and every $k\\geq 2\\ell-1$, $[\\ell,k]$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in bipartite graphs (this holds in particular for $[3,5]$-CH). If $k<2\\ell-1$, the problem is trivial in bipartite graphs.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nWe first claim that, for any $\\ell\\geq 3$ and every $k\\geq 2\\ell-1$, the gadget $H=(B\\cup W, E)=K_{\\binom{2\\ell-2}{\\ell},\\binom{2\\ell-2}{\\ell-1}}$ is $[\\ell,2\\ell-1]$-critical: suppose indeed that $\\ell$-lists of $B$-vertices describe all sets of $\\ell$ colors among $\\{1, \\ldots, 2\\ell-2\\}$, and $(\\ell-1)$-lists of $W$-vertices describe all sets of $(\\ell-1)$ colors among $\\{1, \\ldots, 2\\ell-2\\}$. Then at least $(\\ell-1)$ colors are needed to color $B$-vertices and consequently at least one $W$-vertex cannot be list colored. Moreover if all $B$-vertices are assigned to $\\ell$-lists with colors in $\\{1, \\ldots, 2\\ell-1\\}$, while vertices of $W$ but one are assigned to $(\\ell-1)$-lists, while the last one has an $\\ell$-list, \n\n\nThe proof is similar to the proof of Proposition~\\ref{prop: 3-choos 4 col}, using a complete bipartite graph as gadget. Note indeed that $K_{\\binom{2\\ell-1}{\\ell},\\binom{2\\ell-1}{\\ell-1}}$ is not $[(\\ell,\\ell-1),2\\ell-2]$-choosable. Consider indeed a list assignment with colors in $\\{1, \\ldots, 2\\ell-2\\}$ with all possible lists of $\\ell$  colors for $B$-vertices and all possible lists of $\\ell-1$  colors for $W$-vertices. By choosing one color in each list of $B$ we will need at least $\\ell-1$ colors since for any set $S$ of $\\ell-2$ colors no color will be suitable for the vertex with list $\\{1, \\ldots, 2\\ell-2\\}\\setminus S$. Consequently, for at least one vertex of the right side all colors in its list will be already used in its neighborhood. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop: 3-choos 5 col planar}\n$[3,5]$-CH is $\\Pi_2^p$-complete in triangle-free planar graphs of maximum degree 13.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig-3-5-gen.pdf}\n\\caption{The gadget ${\\cal G}$.}\n\\label{fig: 3-5-fig-gen}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig-3-5-part.pdf}\n\\caption{The gadget ${\\cal G}_3$ with  $f_3$-list assignment forbidding color 3 for $A$.}\n\\label{fig: 3-5-fig-part}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nHere, we consider the gadget ${\\cal G}$ in Figure~\\ref{fig: 3-5-fig-gen} with central vertex $A$, of degree 11. It is made of thee isomorphic gadgets ${\\cal G}_1, {\\cal G}_1, {\\cal G}_3$ pairwise glued by identifying two vertices. Figure~\\ref{fig: 3-5-fig-part} represents ${\\cal G}_3$ with a list assignment making color 3 forbidden at vertex $A$.\n${\\cal G}_3$ is made of two $C_5$'s, $C^1= (A,B,C,D,E)$ and $C^2=(A,B,F,G,H)$, glued by the edge $AB$ with two other $C_5$'s, namely $C^3=(a,b,c,d,e)$ linked to $C^1$ by a matching of size 5 and $C^4=(a',b',f,g,h)$ linked to $C^2$ by a matching of size 5. We define a function $f_3: V({{\\cal G}_3})\\rightarrow \\{2,3\\}$ associating 2 to $C,E,F,H$ and 3 to all other vertices. $f_3$ can be immediately extended to $V({\\cal G})$ and called $f$: ${\\cal G}$ is planar and vertices on the external face are alternately associated with 2 and 3 with vertices in two different ${\\cal G}_i$ associated with~2. They form a set  $S$ which corresponds to black vertices in Figure~\\ref{fig: 3-5-fig-gen}.  \n\nIn what follows, we show that ${\\cal G}$ is $([f,5], S)$-critical. It is straightforward to verify that with the $f_3$-list assignment for ${\\cal G}_3$  in Figure~\\ref{fig: 3-5-fig-part}, color 3 is forbidden for vertex $A$. Hence, by a permutation of colors we can extend this list assignment to ${\\cal G}$ such that color 2 will be forbidden for $A$ (using lists in ${\\cal G}_2$) as well as color 1 (using lists in ${\\cal G}_1$). Figure~\\ref{fig: 3-5-fig-gen} shows the related lists for vertices in $S$. \nWe now need to show that changing $f(s_0)$ from 2 to 3,  for one vertex $s_0$ in $S$  and denoting by $f'$ the new function, ${\\cal G}$ becomes $[f',5]$-choosable. Without loss of generality we can consider that $s_0$ is a vertex of ${\\cal G}_3$ and moreover, by symmetry, that it is either $F$ or $H$. \n\nWe first need to point out some choosability properties of a $C_5$. It is $\\{2,3\\}$-choosable if at least one vertex has a 3-list. If all other vertices have 2-lists, then it may happen that only one single list coloring is possible. If three consecutive vertices have their color fixed and the two other vertices have 3-lists of possible colors, then there are at least two different list colorings of the whole $C_5$. Finally, the $C_5$ is not 2-choosable but the only infeasible 2-list assignment consists of five identical 2-lists. Consider now two $C_5$'s say $C^\\alpha$ and $C^\\beta$ linked by a matching of size~5 (say $C^\\beta$ inside $C^\\alpha$), assign 3-lists to vertices in $C^\\beta$ and $\\{2,3\\}-lists$ to vertices in $C^\\alpha$. If $C^\\alpha$ has two different list colorings, then it will be possible to extend it on vertices of $C^\\beta$. Consider indeed a first list coloring of $C^\\alpha$ that cannot be extended on $C^\\beta$. Necessarily, after removing from the list of every vertex $v$ of $C^\\beta$ the color of its unique neighbor in $C^\\alpha$, all vertices in $C^\\beta$ get the same list with two colors $c_1$ and $c_2$ that are not used in the coloring of $C^\\alpha$. Since at least three different colors were needed to color $C^\\alpha$, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the only colors appearing in all 3-lists in $C^\\beta$. Hence, considering the second possible list coloring of $C^\\alpha$,  and removing from each list in $C^\\beta$ the color of its neighbor in $C^\\alpha$ (if it is in its list), at least two colors are still available for every vertex in $C^\\beta$ and we cannot have five equal 2-lists. Thus, $C^\\beta$ can be colored. \n\n\nConsider now  ${\\cal G}_3$ with any $f_3$-list assignment $L_3$, let $L_3(A)=\\{i,j,k\\}$. If there is no list coloring assigning color $i$ to $A$, then we show that there is at least one list coloring with $A$ colored $j$ and one with $A$ colored $k$. Moreover in each case, the color of $E$ can be arbitrarily chosen in $L_3(E)$ provided it is compatible with the color in $A$. Indeed, after coloring $A$ with $i$, there are still at least two possibilities for coloring  $C^1$ and only one blocks the coloring of the internal $C^3$. We call $col^1$ this coloring of $C^1$. This imposes the color of $B$ and then there is only one way to color $C^2$, called $col^2$, which blocks the coloring of the internal $C^4$. Hence, choosing the color of $A$ among $\\{k,j\\}$ and the color of $E$, compatible with the color of $A$ leads to an alternative way to color $C^1$ and $C^2$, different from $col^1$ and $col^2$ and consequently in each case the list coloring of the whole graph ${\\cal G}_3$ can be completed. \n\nBy a similar argument, we also see that if $i\\notin L_3(H)$ then there is a list coloring of ${\\cal G}_3$ with $A$ colored $i$ and $E$ colored with an arbitrary color of $L_3(E)$ not equal to $i$.\n\nWe are now ready to show that ${\\cal G}$ is $[f',5]$-choosable. Consider any $f'$-list assignment, choose for $A$ a color that is neither forbidden in ${\\cal G}_1$ nor in ${\\cal G}_2$. \n\n{\\em {\\underline{Case 1:}}} $s_0=F$. Using the previous remarks, it is then possible to extend the coloring of $A$ in a list coloring of ${\\cal G}_1\\cup {\\cal G}_2$. We then have for ${\\cal G}_3$ the color of $A, E$ and $H$ fixed. There are still at least two possibilities for coloring $C^1$ with at least one that can be extended to $C^3$. Then, even if the color of $B$ is fixed, both $F$ and $G$ having 3-lists, there are at least two possibilities for coloring $C^2$ with at least one that can be extended to $C^4$.\n\n{\\em {\\underline{Case 2:}}} $s_0=H$. Remove the color of $A$ from $L'(H)$ and apply the same arguments as previously.\nThis concludes that ${\\cal G}$ is $([f,5], S)$-critical. \n\nThe end of the proof is now similar to the proof of Proposition~\\ref{prop: 3-choos 4 col}.\nConsider a \n planar bipartite graph $G$, instance of $[\\{2,3\\},5]$-CH, and denote by $V^2, V^3$ the vertices of $G$ with lists of size 2 and 3, respectively. For every vertex in $v\\in V^2$, we add a gadget ${\\cal G}_v$ isomorphic to ${\\cal G}$  and link the related vertices in $S$ to $v$. Let $\\tilde{G}$ be the resulting graph. It is planar, triangle-free and of maximum degree 13. Using Lemma~\\ref{lem: ff'} for every $v\\in V^2$, we show that\n$\\tilde{G}$ is $[3,5]$-choosable if and only if $G$ is $[\\{2,3\\},5]$-choosable. Using Proposition~\\ref{prop: 2,3-choos 4 col grids} we conclude the proof. \n\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\nIn~\\cite{gutner}, by using an auxiliary graph $W_2$, a triangle-free planar graph with 164 vertices which is not 3-choosable was constructed. A crucial module in this construction was the occurrence of two $C_5$'s linked by a matching. Our gadget ${\\cal G}$ is based on the same module but the modules are combined in a different way in order to limit the number of colors used to $k=5$. This allows us to exhibit a triangle-free planar graph with only 148 vertices which is not $[3,5]$-choosable and hence not 3-choosable: take 3 copies of ${\\cal G}$ and link a new vertex to all black vertices. \n\\end{rmk}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Going from $k$ to $k+1$ colors in bipartite graphs}\\label{sec:kk+1} \n\n\nAs already mentioned a graph is 2-choosable if and only if it is $[2,4]$-choosable  and consequently, up to the threshold value of four colors, the number of available colors does not influence 2-choosability. A natural question is whether such a threshold does exist for $\\ell$-choosability with $\\ell \\geq 3$. A negative answer was given in~\\cite{kral} where the construction of graphs which are $[\\ell,k]$-choosable but not $[\\ell,k+1]$-choosable is given. However the graphs constructed may contain large cliques.  In this section, we show that there even exists bipartite graphs with the same property (Theorem~\\ref{th: kvsk+1}). To this purpose we denote by $P(\\ell,k)$ the following property:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\begin{em}\n\\item[$P(\\ell,k)$] There is a bipartite graph $G$ that is $[\\ell , k]$-choosable  but not $[\\ell , k+1]$-choosable.\n\\end{em}\n\\end{itemize}\n\nResults on 2-choosability state that $P(2, k)$ does not hold for any $k\\geq 4$ and the aim of this section is to show, that, on the contrary,  $\\forall \\ell\\geq 3, \\forall k\\geq 2\\ell-2, P(\\ell,k)$ holds.\n\nNote that, for all $\\ell\\geq 2$, every bipartite graph is $[\\ell , k]$-choosable  if $k\\leq 2\\ell-2$~\\cite{cogis} and  moreover some bipartite graphs are not $[\\ell , 2\\ell-1]$-choosable. Consider indeed a complete bipartite graph $K_{p,p}$, with vertex set $A\\cup B$ and $p=\\binom{k}{\\ell}$ for $k=2\\ell-1$. Consider the $\\ell$-list assignment where $\\{L(a), a\\in A\\}$ and $\\{L(b), b\\in B\\}$ both consist of all possible lists of $\\ell$ colors chosen among the $k$ available colors. \nConsider then any choice of available colors for vertices in $A$. The number of different colors used is at least $\\ell$ (remember that there are $2\\ell -1= \\ell + \\ell-1$ colors) and consequently for at least one vertex in $B$ all available colors are used in its neighborhood. So we have the following:\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{lem:2l-2}\n$\\forall \\ell \\geq 2, P(\\ell, 2\\ell-2)$ holds.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\nWe will first prove by induction that $P(3, k)$ holds for every $k\\geq 4$. Then we will show how to extend this for larger values of $\\ell$.  This requires several lemmas given below.   \n\nThe example of 2-list assignment in Figure~\\ref{fig:choco} is a well known illustration that the \nchocolate is not $[2,3]$-choosable (See e.g.~\\cite{rubin}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0mm 10mm 0mm 10mm,clip,scale=0.3]{fig-choco.pdf}\n\\caption{An infeasible 2-list system  for the chocolate  $G(2,3)$.}\n\\label{fig:choco}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nLemma~\\ref{lem: chocolate} points out that this 2-list system which we call $L_2$ is the only infeasible 2-list system  in this graph.\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{lem: chocolate}\nAny infeasible 2-list system for $G(2,3)$ is isomorphic to the list in Figure~\\ref{fig:choco}.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nConsider the chocolate $H$ with vertices $x_1,x_6$ of degree~3 and vertices $x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5$ of degree~2 (see Figure~\\ref{fig:choco}). Considering a $C_4$ $(x_1, y,z,x_6)$ in $H$: $(y,z)=(x_2,x_4)$ or $(x_3,x_5)$). Assigning the color $a$ to $x_1$ and $b$ to $x_6$ ($a\\neq b, a,b\\in \\{1,2,3\\}$) gives an impossibility on this cycle only in the case where $L(y)=\\{a,c\\}$ and $L(z)=\\{b,c\\}$ with $\\{a,b,c\\}=\\{1,2,3\\}$. \n\nConsider now an infeasible 2-list system for $H$ with colors $\\{1,2,3\\}$. Assume w.l.o.g.  $L(x_1)=\\{1,2\\}$. If $3\\in L(x_6)$, then  $H$ is list colorable since in this case there are three different possible colorings for the pair of vertices $(x_1,x_6)$ and the list system on cycles $(x_1, x_2,x_4,x_6)$ and $(x_1, x_3,x_5,x_6)$ can exclude at most two of them.  So we have  $L(x_6)=\\{1,2\\}$ and this time, to exclude the two possible colorings of $(x_1,x_6)$ (i.e. (1,2) and (2,1)) we need the lists $(\\{1, 3\\}, \\{2,3\\})$ on one cycle and  $(\\{2, 3\\}, \\{1,3\\})$ on the other one. This is the claimed list assignment and any other choice gives the same up to a permutation of colors.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{lem:unique color}\nFor any $k\\geq 4$, suppose there is a bipartite graph $H_k$ which is $[3 , k]$-choosable  and not $[3 , k+1]$-choosable, then there is a bipartite graph $\\widetilde{H}_k$ and a vertex $v_0$ of $\\widetilde{H}_k$ such that:\\\\\n(i) $\\widetilde{H}_k$ is $[3 , k+1]$-choosable;\\\\\n(ii) $\\forall i\\in\\{1, \\ldots, k+1\\}$, there is a 3-list system such that $v_0$ gets color $i$ in every feasible list $(k+1)$-coloring (one can force the color of $v_0$).\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nConsider  an edge-minimal bipartite graph $H'_k=(V'_k,E'_k)$ which is $[3 , k]$-choosable and not $[3 , k+1]$-choosable: for every edge $uv$, $H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$ is $[3 , k+1]$-choosable.  Such a graph necessarily exists since a stable set is always choosable. Consider an infeasible 3-list assignment $L$ of $H'_k$ with $k+1$ colors. Note that for every edge $uv$ and every list coloring of $H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$ with the 3-list system $L$, $u$ and $v$ are necessarily of the same color and in particular $L(u)\\cap L(v)\\neq \\emptyset$. Note also that there is an edge $uv$ such that $L(u)\\neq L(v)$ (else, the assignment would be necessarily feasible since $H'_k$ is bipartite).   \n\nIf  $L(u)\\cap L(v)= \\{i\\}$ for some edge $uv$, then taking $v_0=u$  color $i$ can be forced for $u$ and the same holds for any other color by permutation of colors in $L$; in this case we just take $\\widetilde{H}_k=H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$. \n\nSo, the only remaining case is $L(u)\\cap L(v)= \\{i,j\\}$, say for instance $L(u)\\cap L(v)= \\{3,4\\}$ ($k\\geq 4$). We then consider the graph $H''_k=(V''_k,E''_k)$ obtained from $H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$ by adding a $G(2,3)$ with bipartition $V_1\\cup V_2, |V_1|=|V_2|=3$, and joining completely  $V_1$ with $u$ and $V_2$ with $v$. We then consider two cases:\\\\\n{\\em{Case 1}}: if $H''_k$ is $[3 , k+1]$-choosable, then we take $\\widetilde{H}_k=H''_k$. Vertices of $V'_k$ are assigned to the 3-list system $L$ and we can add color 4 to lists in $L_2$ (See Figure~\\ref{fig:choco}) for lists of vertices in $V''_k\\setminus V'_k$. By definition of $H'_k$, in $H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$, $u$ and $v$ will be assigned the same color, 3 or 4 in any feasible list coloring with $k+1$ colors. However the list system prevents $u$ and $v$ from taking both color 4 and consequently color 3 can be forced for $u=v_0$.\\\\\n{\\em{Case 2}}: if $H''_k$ is not $[3 , k+1]$-choosable, consider an infeasible 3-list system $L'$ for  $H''_k$ with $k+1$ colors. Define $L'(u)=\\{a,b,c\\}$ and $L'(v)=\\{a',b',c'\\}$. Suppose that $u$ and $v$ are assigned  color $a$  and $a'$, respectively in some list $(k+1)$-coloring of $H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$ with 3-list system $L'$, then removing $a$ ($a'$) from lists of neighbors of $u$ ($v$) in $V''_k\\setminus V'_k$, respectively, leads to a infeasible 2-list assignment for $G(3,2)$ and Lemma~\\ref{lem: chocolate} imposes that $u$ and $v$ are colored $a$ and $a'$, respectively, in some list $(k+1)$-coloring of  $H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$ and consequently we can take $\\widetilde{H}_k=H'_k\\setminus \\{uv\\}$ and $u=v_0$, which completes the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nFor any fixed $k\\geq 5$ and $K\\geq k$, we define $T_{K}$ as the caterpillar in Figure~\\ref{fig:KT} with vertex set $S^K\\cup R^K$, where $S^K=\\{s_0, \\ldots, s_{K}\\}$ and $R^K=\\{r_1, \\ldots, r_{K-1}\\}$ and edges $s_0r_1, r_ir_{i+1}, i=1, \\ldots, K-2, r_{K-1}s_K$ and $s_ir_i, i=1, \\ldots, K-1$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fig-T.pdf}\n\\caption{Caterpillar $T_K$.}\n\\label{fig:KT}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{lem: T}\\mbox{}\\\\\n(i) For any 1-list assignment to $S^K$ with $k$ colors such that $L(s_0)\\neq L(s_1)$ and $L(s_{K-1})\\neq L(s_K)$, there is a 3-list assignment to $R^K$ with $k$ colors such that there is no feasible list coloring.\\\\\n(ii) However, $T_K$ is $f$-choosable for any  $f$ satisfying:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[] $f(s_i)=1, i\\neq i_0, f(i_0)=2, i_0\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K\\}$\n\\item[] $f(r_j)=3, j\\in\\{1, \\ldots, K-2\\}$\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe denote by ${\\cal K}$ the set of $k$ colors.\n(i) Let $c_i$ be the color of $s_i$, $i=0, \\ldots, K$, we construct for each $r_i$, $i=1, \\ldots, K-1$, a list $L_i$ of size~3 such that there is no feasible list coloring. By assumption $c_0\\neq c_1$. Let $L_1=\\{c_0, c_1, c'_1\\}$ with $c'_1\\in {\\cal K}$, $c'1\\neq c_0, c_1, c_2$ ($c'_1$ is forced in $r_1$) and $L_2=\\{c'_1, c_2, c'_2\\}$ with $c'_2\\in {\\cal K}$, $c'2\\neq c'_1, c_2, c_3$ ($c'_2$ is forced in $r_2$).

Then by choosing $L_{K-1}=\\{c_{K-1}, c'_{K-2}, c_K\\}$ ($c_K\\neq c_{K-1}$ by assumption) no choice is possible for the color of vertex $r_{K-1}$. This shows that with this list assignment there is no feasible list coloring while the list $L_i$ satisfies $|L_i|=3, i=1, \\ldots, K-1$. \n\n(ii) Now we show that if some $s_i$, say $s_{i_0}$, has a list $L(s_{i_0})$ of size 2, there is a coloring whatever the lists are with the above sizes.

Remove  color  $c(u)$ from lists of vertices in $\\bigcup_{i=1, \\ldots, r}V^1_{\\ell,k,i}$ and  color  $c(v)$ from lists of vertices in $\\bigcup_{i=1, \\ldots, r}V^2_{\\ell,k,i}$ and remove arbitrarily at most one color from lists of vertices in $\\bigcup_{i=1, \\ldots, r}V^1_{\\ell,k,i}\\cup \\bigcup_{i=1, \\ldots, r}V^2_{\\ell,k,i}$ so as to obtain exactly $\\ell$ available colors for each one of these vertices. Color with $c(u)$ all vertices of $\\bigcup_{i=1, \\ldots, r}V^2_{\\ell,k,i}$ with $c(u)$ in their own list. Then $H_{\\ell,k}$ being $\\ell$-choosable  with $k$ colors, the remaining uncolored graph is $\\ell$-choosable  with $k$ colors and has at most $k$ colors (all colors but $c(u)$ in its lists). So the list coloring can be extended to the entire graph $H_{\\ell+1,k+1}$.\n\n{\\underline{$H_{\\ell+1,k+1}$ is not $[\\ell+1 , k+2]$-choosable:}}\\\\\nDenote by $\\{c_1, \\ldots, c_r\\}=L(u)\\cap L(v)$. For every $i=1,\\ldots, r$,\nconsider an infeasible  $\\ell$-list assignment using  colors $\\{1, \\ldots, k+2\\}\\setminus \\{c_i\\}$  for $H_{\\ell,k,i}$ and add color $c_i$ to all of its lists. We define an infeasible $(\\ell+1)$-list assignment of $H_{\\ell+1,k+1}$ by completing this list assignment with the list assignment $L$ for $H'_{\\ell+1,k}$. Indeed, for any list coloring of $H'_{\\ell+1,k}$, $u$ and $v$ have the same color $c_j\\in\\{c_1, \\ldots, c_r\\}$ and then the subgraph  $H_{\\ell,k,j}$ cannot be list colored, which completes the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe can now prove the main result of this section:\n\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{th: kvsk+1}\nFor any  $\\ell \\geq 3$ and any $k\\geq 2\\ell-2$, there is a bipartite graph that is $[\\ell, k]$-choosable but not $[\\ell, k+1]$-choosable (Property $P(\\ell, k)$ holds.)\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nUsing Lemmas~\\ref{lem:2l-2} and \\ref{lem: kk+1}, it remains only to show $P(3,k)$ for any $k\\geq 4$.\nWe will proceed by induction on $k$. $P(3,4)$ holds from Lemma~\\ref{lem:2l-2}. Let us assume $P(3,k)$ holds for a fixed $k\\geq 4$ and show that $P(3,k+1)$ holds. \n\nFrom Lemma~\\ref{lem:unique color}, there is a bipartite graph $\\widetilde{H}_k$ which is $[3, k+1]$-choosable. Moreover there is a vertex $v_0$ such that for any $i, i=1, \\ldots, k+1$, one can find 3-lists such that $v_0$ gets color $i$ in any feasible list $(k+1)$-coloring. We take $k+2$ copies of $\\widetilde{H}_k$, say $\\widetilde{H}_{k,1}, \\ldots,\\widetilde{H}_{k,k+2}$ and let $v_{0,1}, \\ldots, v_{0,k+2}$ be the related copies of $v_0$. Let $K=(k+2)(k+1)/2$ be the number of pairs $(i,j)$ ($1\\leq i<j\\leq k+2$). We take a caterpillar $T_{K-1}$  as defined in Lemma~\\ref{lem: T}. It has $K$ vertices of degree~1 which we associate with every such pair $(i,j)$; let $s_{i,j}$ be the vertex corresponding to $(i,j)$. We link every vertex   $s_{i,j}$ to $v_{0,i}$ and $v_{0,j}$. In the resulting graph called $H_{k+1}$, vertices $s_{i,j}$ have degree~3. \n\nOne verifies that $H_{k+1}$ is $[3, k+1]$-choosable. By assumption the $k+2$ graphs $\\widetilde{H}_{k,1}, \\ldots,\\widetilde{H}_{k,k+2}$ are $[3, k+1]$-choosable. Since we use $k+1$ colors, there are at least two vertices $v_{0,i_0}, v_{0,j_0}$ which have the same color. This means that in $L(s_{i_0,j_0})$ there are at least two available colors (we remove color $c(v_{0,i_0})=c(v_{0,j_0})$). Hence, from Lemma~\\ref{lem: T}(ii), the $(k+1)$-coloring can be extended to $H_{k+1}$. \n\nLet us now show that $H_{k+1}$ is not $[3, k+2]$-choosable. From Lemma~\\ref{lem:unique color}, one can assign 3-lists to each $\\widetilde{H}_{k,i}$, $i=1, \\ldots, k+2$,   using in all $k+2$ colors in such a way that in each feasible list $(k+2)$-coloring, vertex $v_{0,i}$ will get color $i$. We then have to assign 3-lists to the vertices $s_{i,j}$ in such a way that the coloring cannot be extended to the entire $T_{K-1}$.  $s_{i,j}$ is linked to $v_{0,i}$ and $v_{0,j}$ ($i\\neq j$) which have different colors $c_i,c_j$, so one can choose a 3-list $L(s_{i,j})$ for each vertex $s_{i,j}$ by taking colors $c_i,c_j$ and another color which can be chosen in ${\\cal K}$ as was done in the proof of Lemma~\\ref{lem: T} so that the coloring cannot be extended to $H_{k+1}$. This ends the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\\label{sec:conclusion} \n\nIn this paper we have pointed out that when the number $k$ of colors is limited, the situation may be very different from the case where $k$ is not specified.\nThere are many more questions to examine in this area. \n\nA first question arises with respect to  the relative complexity of $[\\ell, k]$-choosability and $[\\ell, k+1]$-choosability. In particular, can we say that increasing the number of colors makes the problem of deciding whether a graph is choosable easier or harder. In some cases, adding one color makes the problem harder; a trivial example is given by Proposition~\\ref{prop: 3-choos 4 col}: $[3,4]$-choosability has been shown hard in a class of 3-colorable graphs, while $[3,3]$-choosability is trivial on this class. A similar situation is exhibited in Proposition~\\ref{prop: l-choos k col bip} between $[3,4]$-choosability and $[3,5]$-choosability of bipartite graphs. Another situation appears in Proposition~\\ref{prop: 2,3-choos 4 col grids}: the proof points out that, up to a fixed threshold on the number of colors, the complexity of the problem does not change when the number of colors increases.  However, the situation is not always that simple. Theorem~\\ref{th: kvsk+1} gives examples for which increasing the number of possible colors may make the problem easier. Consider indeed the class obtained by adding to any bipartite graph a bipartite graph $H_5$ that is $[3,5]$-choosable but not $[3,6]$-choosable. This transformation does not change the $[3,5]$-choosability while making the new graph not $[3,6]$-choosable. So, using Proposition~\\ref{prop: l-choos k col bip}, $[3,5]$-CH is hard on this class while $[3,6]$-CH is trivial since the answer is always negative.\n\nAmong the remaining open questions, let us mention the complexity status of $[(2,3), 4]$-CH in bipartite graphs and of $[\\{2,3\\}, 4]$-CH in subgrids of maximum degree 3. The status of  $[3, 4]$-CH in triangle-free planar graphs is also open to the best of our knowledge.\n\nAnother research direction would be to consider the edge choosability of graphs and to examine in particular the complexity status of list edge-coloring in specific classes of graphs when the number of colors is limited. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements} \nThis research was carried out while the first author was visiting EPFL in 2013 and 2014.

These properties are inspired by~\\cite{rubin}.\n\n\n$P_{1/2}$ has the following properties:\n\n {\\bf (1)} for every $f_{P_{1/2}}$-list assignment and any choice of color $c\\in L(I)$, there is a list coloring with $I$ colored~$c$,\\\\\n {\\bf(2)} for any choice of color $c'\\in L(O')$, there is a list coloring with $O'$ colored~$c'$,\\\\\n {\\bf(3)} there is an $f_{P_{1/2}}$-list assignment with $0\\in L(I)$ and $0\\in L(O')$ and such that in any possible list coloring with $I$ colored $0$, $O'$ will be also colored $0$. \n\n (1) is immediate by using Proposition~\\ref{claim: C} and ordering vertices by orienting edges from $I$ to $a,b$, from $a$ to $b$ and then from $a,b$, to $O'$.\n(2) is a consequence of the fact that $\\theta_{2,2,10}$ is 2-choosable.\n(3) can be shown using the $f_{P_{1/2}}$-list assignment shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:half-propagator}.\n\nAn immediate consequence  of (2) is:\n\n{\\bf(4)} for any $f_{P_{1/2}}$-list assignment, there is a color $c\\in L(I)$ such that for two different colors $c',d'\\in L(O')$ there are two list colorings with $I$ colored $c$ and $O'$ colored $c'$ and $d'$, respectively. \n\nThus, the gadget $P$ will satisfy the following properties:\n\n{\\bf(1')} for every $f_{P}$-list assignment and any choice of color $c\\in L(I)$, there is a list coloring with $I$ colored~$c$, \n \n{\\bf (3')} there is an $f_{P}$-list assignment with $0\\in L(I)$ and $0\\in L(O)$ and such that in any possible list coloring with $I$ colored $0$, $O$ will be also colored $0$,\\\\\n{\\bf (4')} for any $f_{P}$-list assignment, there is a color $c\\in L(I)$ such that there are at least 3 list colorings of $P$ with $I$ colored $c$ and $O$ colored with any color in $L(O)$.\n\nTo show (4'), one selects $c\\in L(I)$ such that it is compatible with two different colors in $L(O')$ and then we apply property (2) on the second $P_{1/2}$ forming $P$ with $L(O')$ reduced to these two colors.  \n\nFor a $C_4=(u,u',\\bar u,u'')$ associated with the $\\forall$-variable $U$ shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:forall}, it has already been noted in~\\cite{rubin} that, for any 2-list assignment and for any two opposite vertices in the $C_4$, one of them may have only one possible color in any list coloring, but in this case the other one can be given any of its two possible colors.  For instance, a 2-list assignment imposing  color 0 to $u_i$ is $L(u_i)=L(u'_i)=\\{0,1\\}, L(u''_i)=\\{1,2\\}$ and $L(\\bar{u}_i)=\\{0,2\\}$.\n\n{\\underline{The reduction}}:\n\nWe are now ready to remind the main arguments for proving statements (i) and (ii).\n\n{\\bf (i)} Suppose that ${\\cal I}$ is satisfiable and consider any $f$-list assignment for $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$.  This list assignment may impose some colors among  the literal vertices $u,\\bar u$ associated with $\\forall$-variables, but never to two different vertices associated with the same variable. We set the related literals to False, which defines a truth assignment for some $\\forall$-variables. We arbitrary choose the truth assignment of other $\\forall$-variables. We then consider a truth assignment of $\\exists$-variables such that each clause contains at least one true literal. \n\nThen for every   vertex associated with a true literal, we choose its color so that it is compatible with any available color of the Output of the related gadget $P$ (using (4')). We then complete the list coloring of all variable gadgets and for any vertex associated with a false literal, the related $P$ and, possibly a second $P$ are list colored using property (1'). We also color the connection paths between the Outputs of these colored $P$'s and clause vertices. Then we color the clause vertices, which is possible since no clause vertex has all its three neighbors already colored (only those corresponding to a false literal are colored). Finally, we  color the connection paths associated with true literals by starting from the clause vertex. Using Property (4') it can be extended to the related $P$'s, which concludes the proof: $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ is choosable.\n\n{\\bf (ii)} Suppose now $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ is $[f,3]$-choosable; consider any truth assignment for $\\forall$-variables and we will show there is a truth assignment for $\\exists$-variables satisfying all clauses. We construct an $f$-list assignment for $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ as follows. We first fix the 2-lists of $\\forall$-variable gadgets so that the color of the False $\\forall$-literal vertices is necessarily 0 and  the related True $\\forall$-literal vertices get the list $\\{0,2\\}$, both compatible (see Figure~\\ref{fig:forall}). The $\\exists$-literal vertices have the list $\\{0,1\\}$ such that $0$ for one literal implies 1 for its opposite. We also determine the 2-lists of all gadgets $P$ and intermediate vertices $M$ such that color $0$ for the Input induces  color 0 for all related Outputs. Clauses are associated with the 3-list $\\{0,1,2\\}$. The literals of the clause are ordered $x_0,x_1,x_2$, which defines a numbering of the three connection paths arriving at this vertex (path $i$, $i=0,1,2$ corresponds to literal $x_i$). Then define 2-lists on the connection paths such that  color 0 at the Output vertex induces  color $i$ at the last vertex before the related clause vertex.\n\nSince $\\widetilde{\\Gamma}_{\\Phi}$ is $[f,3]$-choosable, there is a list coloring. It defines a truth assignment for all $\\exists$-variables, color $0$ corresponding to the value False. By choice of the lists, a clause associated with only false literals could not be colored. This means that this truth assignment satisfies all clauses, which concludes the proof.\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6570, "prevtext": "\nOf course, $G(p,q)$ and $G(q,p)$ are isomorphic. $G(2,3)$ (and $G(3,2)$) is called a {\\em chocolate}.\nAll graph-theoretical terms not defined here can be found in~\\cite{cb73}.\n\n\\vspace{0.5 cm}\n\nGiven a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a function $f: V\\longrightarrow {\\mathbb N}$, $G$ is called {\\em $[f, k]$-choosable} if it has a list $k$-coloring for every list system $L$ satisfying $\\forall v\\in V, |L(v)|=f(v)$. \nIf $\\forall v\\in V, f(v)=\\ell$, then $G$ is simply called  {\\em $[\\ell, k]$-choosable}. \n\nFor a bipartite graph $G=(B\\cup W, E)$, {\\em $[(p,q),k]$-choosability} corresponds to the function $f$ defined by: \n\n", "index": 3, "text": "$$\nf(v)=\n\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{lll}\np & \\mbox{for} &  v \\in B \\\\\nq & \\mbox{for} &  v \\in W\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\n$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f(v)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{lll}p&amp;\\mbox{for}&amp;v\\in B\\\\&#10;q&amp;\\mbox{for}&amp;v\\in W\\end{array}\\right.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mi>p</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mtext>for</mtext></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mi>q</mi></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mtext>for</mtext></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>W</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable><mi/></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
