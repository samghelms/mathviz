They are used   to both measure and track large scale field variations, such as in geomagnetic surveys \\cite{lenci_jpb_12}, and to detect local magnetic variations, such as in measurements of ultra-low-field NMR \\cite{savukov_prl_05, biancalana_arnmrs_13,  bevilacqua_jmr_16} and  MRI \\cite{savukov_jmr_13}, in relaxometry \\cite{ganssle_2014, dolgovskiy_jmmm_15}, in biomagnetic applications such as magneto-cardiography \\cite{belfi_josab_07, bison_apl_09, kamada_pm_12, alem_pmb_15} and in magneto-encephalography \\cite{johnson_apl_10, romalis_2006}. The detection of weak local signals can be performed in small shielded volumes, and indeed this approach is preferable when small sized sources need to be characterised. However, the existence of large sized samples (such as human bodies in biomagnetic measurements), the high costs and the delicateness of shielding devices may prompt the use of alternative methods in order to reject the magnetic noise generated by far-located sources. \n\nMulti-channel sensors \\cite{bison_apl_09, alem_pmb_15} open the way for the active compensation of common mode magnetic signals as well as the direct measurement of difference mode signals. Thus, even if top-level sensitivity normally requires  operation in shielded volumes, relatively high-sensitivity magnetometry can be profitably performed in open volumes \\cite{bevilacqua_jmr_09, bevilacqua_jmr_16} with a more simplified implementation  when using sensor operating in non-vanishing fields. \nSuperconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) have traditionally provided the highest magnetometric sensitivity. Recently, the most sensitive atomic magnetometers in the spin-exchange-relaxation-free (SERF) regime, which operate in vanishing fields, have demonstrated their competitiveness with SQUIDs, while also having the advantage of not requiring cryogenic cooling, and of being unaffected by electric noise. Compared to SQUIDs and SERF, other atomic magnetometers have worse sensitivity, although their performance remains better than $1~\\mbox{pT}/\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$, meaning that they are unrivalled by other simpler devices such as Hall and magnetoresistance sensors. \n\nAtomic magnetometry is based on the detection of the Larmor precession of an optically pumped vapour in the field under measurement. \nThe basic working principles of atomic magnetometers date back to over a century ago \\cite{macaluso_98, macaluso_99}, and the first pioneering implementations date back several decades \\cite{bell_prl_61}. Nevertheless,  renewed interest in atomic magnetometry has arisen much more recently, thanks to progresses in the knowledge of optical pumping processes \\cite{happer_rmp_72, auzinsh_2010}, and to technical achievements regarding laser sources and atomic sample manufacturing \\cite{shah_nat_07}. This set of circumstances has led to important advances in the last decade, so that  atomic magnetometers now represent a versatile class of sensors with state-of-the-art sensitivity \\cite{budker_natph_07, chalupczak_apl_12, romalis_prl_13}. \nIn contrast to SQUID magnetometers, which are vector detectors that measure the field projection along one particular direction, atomic magnetometers (at least in their basic configuration) are scalar in nature, as they measure the modulus of the magnetic field. A scalar sensor operating in a dominant bias field is mainly sensitive  to the field variation along the bias field. Thus atomic magnetometers operating in non-vanishing fields are responsive to one component. \n\nProvided that the environmental (bias) field is relatively homogeneous, this kind of magnetometers can be profitably organised into sets of two or more elements to produce a gradiometric response \\cite{belfi_josa_09, bison_apl_09}, thus rejecting common-mode magnetic noise and identifying signals as weak as several orders of magnitudes below the bias field.\n\nIn this paper we describe an all-optical atomic magnetometer based on Cs vapour, optically pumped by means of a frequency modulated laser source tuned to the D$_1$ line, and probed through the Faraday rotation of a weak linearly polarised beam tuned to the D$_2$ line. The system contains two composite sensors and the output signals are extracted from two couples of half-beam polarimeters, thus obtaining a four-channel system. Depending on the  channels selected and on  choices at the data analysis stage, this setup enables gradiometric measurements of various orders and with several differently arranged baselines.\nThe  sensitivity demonstrated is limited by  residual magnetic noise at low frequencies, and, when using the shortest baseline, is essentially determined by the instrumental noise. In this latter configuration the sensitivity level ($100~\\mbox{fT}/\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$ in the range  20~Hz$\\div$100~Hz) is comparable to values reported in the literature for similar setups operating in a shielded environment.\n\n\n\\section{Setup overview}\n\\label{sec:setup}\n\\subsection {Optics}\n\\label{subsec:optics}\nThis magnetometer is the evolution of an apparatus described previously \\cite{belfi_josa_09, biancalana_arnmrs_13}. It has two identical arms for differential measurements,\nbut also  allows   for   quadruple   channel  operation.   Each  arm   (see\nFig.~\\ref{fig:setup}) contains  an illuminator (ILL) providing  two co-propagating radiations, a Cs vapour cell, and a dual balanced polarimeter. One of the radiations is resonant\n with the D$_1$ transitions of  the Cs atoms  and is used to optically pump the\natoms; the other radiation is resonant with the D$_2$  transitions and is used to  probe the atomic\nspins precession. The\nlight generated by the pump laser  D$_1$L and by the probe laser D$_2$L is\ncoupled to  a polarisation-maintaining fibre (PMF).  A  proper mixture\nof the two lights  is accomplished using a\n$2\\times  2$ PM  on-fibre mixer. Both  light sources  are based  on solid-state\ncontinuous-wave lasers. The probe  radiation is attenuated by means of\nan  on-fibre attenuator (Att) and is kept at a constant frequency, while the pump  radiation is  left at  the mW level, and is broadly frequency modulated.   In the proximity of  each\nvapour  cell, the  two  radiations  are\ncollimated  into  a beam  of about  10~mm in  diameter, their\nlinear polarisation is reinforced by a polarising cube, and finally a\nspecial  multi-order waveplate (MOWP)  makes  the pump radiation\ncircularly polarised, while leaving the probe one linearly polarised. \n\nFor this purpose we took advantage of quartz's property of birefringence at the D$_1$ and D$_2$ transition wavelengths in Cs. In fact, it is possible \\cite{optisource_priv_10} to design a multi-order quartz waveplate with a nominal relative delay of 4.75 wavelengths for  D$_1$ radiation and 5.00045 wavelengths for  D$_2$ radiation. Thanks to their low  order, the relative delay of such waveplates is only weakly dependent upon misalignment (less than 0.1 \\% for $1\\deg$ misalignment).\n\nThe MOWP technique was similarly employed in another setup described in the literature \\cite{johnson_apl_10}, with several practical advantages that are worthy of mention. In fact, the use of different transitions for the pump and probe processes, facilitates both the alignment (the two radiations are mixed in one fibre, and propagate after collimation  along a single optical axis) and the pump suppression after the interaction. This is effectively accomplished by means of an interference filter.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n   \\centering\n  \\includegraphics [width=\\columnwidth] {fig1_1arm2chinset.eps}\n  \\caption{Schematics of  a single arm of  the magnetometer. The\n    D$_1$L  pumps the  atoms and  the D$_2$L  probes them.  The two  radiations  are  mixed in  the\n    $2\\times2$  coupler, and  led  to the  sensor  via a  polarisation-maintaining fibre (PMF). At the PMF output, the illuminator (ILL) collimates the two radiations into a single beam and adjusts    their polarisation by means of a  multi-order\n    wave-plate (MOWP), which renders  the polarization of the pump circular, and leaves  the polarisation of the probe linear. The Cs \n    cell  is   illuminated  by  the two\n    co-propagating  radiations.    After  interaction with the Cs vapour, the pump radiation is stopped\n    by  an  interference  filter  (IF), while the probe impinges on a Wollaston polariser (W) oriented at $45^\\circ$ with respect to the input polarisation plane. A dual balanced  polarimeter (DBP)\n    measures the rotation of the probe polarisation plane  for the two halves of the beam separately. To this end, the  imbalances in the photocurrents flowing in the two couples of series silicon photodiodes are amplified by trans-impedance amplifiers (TIA). The inset represents  a front view of the probe beams of both the arms, where the relative orientations of  the various baselines and of the bias magnetic field are defined.}\n  \\label{fig:setup}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Sensor}\n\\label{subsec:sensor}\nThe  atomic  sensors  are  made  of high quality sealed  cells with flat windows, containing    solid source Cs and\n23~torr  of N$_2$  as a  buffer gas.   The  vapour density of the Cs is increased by\nwarming  the  cells up  to  about  $45^\\circ$C by means of an  alternating\ncurrent heater. The heater is made of two coaxial coils of thin copper wire wound in an anti-inductive configuration. Possible spurious  magnetic fields generated by the heater are rendered of negligible relevance \\cite{bevilacqua_pra_12} by supplying the coils at $50$~kHz, a value largely exceeding the atomic Larmor frequency.\n\nAfter  interaction  with the  atomic  vapour,  the  pump beam  is\nblocked  by an  interference  filter  (IF) [Thorlabs 850/40, with a transmission of 98.5\\% at 852~nm and an optical density of 4.2 at 894~nm] and   the  probe  beam\npolarisation is analysed by dual balanced polarimeters (DBP) made of a\n45$^\\circ$  oriented Wollaston  analyser  (W) and  two  couples of  silicon\nphoto-detectors. A  similar technique, based on segmented photodetectors, has  recently been applied in a higher buffer-gas pressure potassium setup \\cite{keder_aip_14}. \nEach  couple of photodetectors measures the polarisation of half a beam (a semicircle in the inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig:setup}) by converting the Faraday rotation into a photo-current imbalance, which is in turn amplified and converted into voltage by \nlow-noise  trans-impedance  amplifiers  (TIA).  The operator may select the channels to be acquired and the corresponding TIA outputs are simultaneously digitised by means of a 16 bit  data acquisition card. \n\nThe sensors work in a  homogeneous magnetic field $\\vec B_{\\mathrm {bias}}$, which is obtained by partially compensating the environmental one and is oriented along the $y$ axis. The longitudinal field component ($x$) is zeroed, and thus the sample magnetisation, which is periodically reinforced along the optical axis, precesses in the $xz$ plane. Small variations in the field slightly change the resonant precession frequency, or (as discussed in the Appendix) the precession phase when periodic resonant pumping is applied. \n\n\n\\section{Principle of operation}\n\\label{sec:principle}\n\\subsection{Laser sources and modulation of the optical frequency}\n\nThe  probe  radiation  is  generated by  D$_2$L, a  single-mode,  Fabry-Perot,\npigtailed  diode  laser  that is near-resonant  with  the  D$_2$  line  of  Cs  at\n852~nm.  This  illuminates the  cell  at a  weak intensity,  which is \nattenuated  down to  a level  of  a  few  $\\mu\\mbox{W/cm}^2$ in  order  to\nnegligibly perturb the  atomic state measured.\n\nThe  pump  radiation  is   generated  by D$_1$L,  a  single-mode,  distributed\nfeedback, pigtailed diode laser. Its optical frequency is controlled\nthrough the junction current and is periodically made resonant to the\ntransition      $|^2S_{1/2}, F_g=3  \\rangle \\rightarrow\n|^2P_{1/2} \\rangle$ of  Cs  at  894~nm. The  optical frequency of the pump  laser is modulated\nusing  a square wave  signal generated  by a computer-controlled digital-to-analogue converter. \n\n\nApplying a square wave modulation to the junction current of D$_1$L produces a modulation of the optical frequency that cannot  easily be described in terms of frequency steps. At least three aspects have to be taken into account in order to evaluate the response to sudden changes in the modulating signal. First of all, the modulation input of the laser driver has a limited bandwidth. This acts as a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency set at about $\\Gamma_1=2\\pi \\times$25kHz in our case. In addition, when changing the junction current, the laser emission changes for two reasons. The first is related to the change of  refraction index and has a very quick (instantaneous) response. The second reason is a thermal change of the cavity length, and is a much slower process. The latter introduces a second cut-off frequency at $\\Gamma_2 \\approx 2\\pi \\times$30~Hz.\nWe performed a detailed characterisation, based on techniques involving both atomic and interferometric references  \\cite{dancheva_rsi_13}). The optical frequency response to a signal at $\\omega$ can be modelled as the sum of two low-pass-filtered terms, and the instantaneous optical frequency deviation can be approximated as\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta \\nu=  \\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty} \n\\left (\\frac{w_1 \\Gamma_1}{\\Gamma_1+i n\\omega } +\n\\frac{w_2 \\Gamma_2}{\\Gamma_2+ i n\\omega_0 } \\right )\nV_n  + c.c.\n\\label{eq:modulazmodel}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta\\nu=\\sum_{n=0}^{+\\infty}\\left(\\frac{w_{1}\\Gamma_{1}}{\\Gamma_{1}+in\\omega%&#10;}+\\frac{w_{2}\\Gamma_{2}}{\\Gamma_{2}+in\\omega_{0}}\\right)V_{n}+c.c.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></mrow></munderover><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c9</mi></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06938.tex", "nexttext": "\nis a square wave with amplitude  $A$  and duty cycle $\\delta$.

The figure is not to scale, but is produced in accordance with the simple model described by eq.~\\ref{eq:modulazmodel}. In the text the maximal and minimal frequencies reached in the period will be referred to as \\textit{front}- and \\textit{back}-frequency, respectively.}\n\\label{fig:modulaz}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Atom-light interaction}\nThe D$_1$L optical frequency deviation amounts to tens of GHz, thus the radiation periodically goes in and out of resonance with given transitions of the D$_1$ line. \n\n\n\nLet us define the highest instantaneous optical frequency as \\textit{front} frequency and correspondingly the lowest one as \\textit{back} frequency (see Figs.~\\ref{fig:modulaz} and \\ref{fig:opt_pump}).  If the frequency deviation is kept constant,  when the \\textit{front} and the \\textit{back} frequencies increase, the amplitude and the width of the magnetic resonance change, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}. The probe laser is cw and tuned to be nearly resonant with the triplet $| ^2S_{1/2}, F_g=4 \\rangle \\rightarrow | ^2P_{3/2} \\rangle$, thus it probes the atomic precession of the $F_g=4$ state. When the D$_1$L approaches the D$_1$ line from the side of the $|^2S_{1/2}, F_g=3 \\rangle \\rightarrow | ^2P_{1/2}, F_e=4 \\rangle$ transition, the amplitude of the resonance increases, while its width remains almost constant. The amplitude shows two maxima occurring when the \\textit{front} frequency goes into resonance with the transitions \n$| ^2S_{1/2}, F_g=3 \\rangle \\rightarrow | ^2P_{1/2}, F_e=3,4 \\rangle $ (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}a)) and when the  \\textit{back} frequency goes into resonance with the $|^2S_{1/2}, F_g=4 \\rightarrow | ^2P_{1/2} \\rangle$ (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}b)), respectively.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics [width=\\columnwidth] {fig3_excitation.eps}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Amplitude and width of the observed resonance line  for a fixed D$_1$L modulation span, as a function of the front frequency.

This  produces (see  Fig.~\\ref{fig:modulaz} and eq.~\\ref{eq:modulazmodel}) the instantaneous D$_1$L frequency represented by black lines in the insets, having a span of 11.2~GHz. Two amplitude maxima are observed when either (a) the front frequency is resonant with the leftmost hyperfine component or (b) the back frequency is resonant with the rightmost one. In  case (a) the resonance width is minimum, which makes this configuration the optimal working condition. The dashed lines correspond to intermediate detunings, at which no clear resonance line is observed.\n}\n\\label{fig:opt_pump}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWhen D$_1$L is near-resonant orresonant with the $F_g=4$ (either with its \\textit{front} or \\textit{back} frequency),  the resonance width increases dramatically untile the resonance is barely recognisable. In the rightmost region, when the back frequency is near-resonant with the $F_g=4$ (Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}b),  the resonance amplitude grows again (high-rate Zeeman optical pumping is performed), but the resonance is much broader. Moreover, in this condition a small red detuning results in an abrupt decrease in the signal amplitude, due to hyperfine optical pumping toward the unprobed $F_g=3$ ground state.  \n\n \n\n\\subsection{Sensitivity and optimal working conditions}\nThe modulation duty cycle, amplitude and offset are adjusted to ensure\nmaximum sensitivity. As seen from Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}, the best sensitivity is achieved when  the D$_1$L \\textit{front} frequency  is  resonant with the $|^2S_{1/2}, F_g=3  \\rangle \\rightarrow |^2P_{1/2}\\rangle$ hyperfine components  of the D$_1$ line. Concerning the probe laser, its optimal frequency is found to be 2~GHz blue detuned with respect to the triplet  $|^2S_{1/2},  F_g=4  \\rangle \\rightarrow  |^2P_{3/2}\\rangle$, which  is an acceptable compromise in order to achieve a good Faraday rotation signal and small excitation rate. \n\n\nUnder these conditions, the pump laser plays two roles: it causes a strong hyperfine optical pumping of the Cs atoms towards the  ground state analysed, and simultaneously pumps the atoms into a specific Zeeman sublevel of that state, due to its circular polarisation.   \nThe combination of these two effects ensures a high amplitude and small linewidth of the resonance, also thanks to the effect known as light narrowing \\cite{appelt_pra_99, scholtes_pra_11}. The linewidth is also narrow  thanks to the fact that the  hyperfine ground state measured is weakly perturbed, because D$_1$L is  either far off-resonance or resonant with the other (depleted)  hyperfine  ground  state.\n\nThe Zeeman  pumping produces magnetisation of the Cs vapour along the wave-vector ($x$ direction). As the magnetic  field is transverse to the pump light propagation ($y$ direction), the   atomic state where atoms are pumped evolves  in  time. At a macroscopic scale this corresponds to  a magnetisation  precession in the  $xz$ plane at an angular frequency $\\omega_L$, which is set by the magnetic field modulus $B$ and the gyromagnetic factor $\\gamma$: $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.  Clearly detectable precessing magnetisation is obtained, again at the macroscopic level, when the pump radiation interacts with the atoms synchronously with the precession. \n\n\n\n\\section{Operation modes, field range, resonance linewidth}\n\\label{sec:operation}\nThe atomic precession is detected by analysing the Faraday rotation of\na weak linearly  polarised  probe  beam,  propagating  in  the  $x$\ndirection.  As it is well known, the linear probe beam  polarisation can be decomposed into two  $\\sigma^+$ and $\\sigma^-$ counter-rotating circular polarisation  components, which  experience  opposite variations to the respective refractive indexes, due to the atomic spin precession. These two  circular components  eventually recombine,  with  time-dependent relative  dephasing,  into a linear  polarisation, which is rotated  by an angle  oscillating  at the  precession  frequency.   Beside the different dispersions,  the  $\\sigma^+$ and  $\\sigma^-$  components experience  also different levels of absorption,  but the relevance of this  aspect is  limited by appropriately detuning the probe  laser from the  centre of the atomic resonance.\n\nThe polarimetric signal can be analysed as a function of the D$_1$L modulation frequency in order to characterise  the   atomic  magnetic\nresonance, in an operation mode that is referred to as \\textit{scanning mode} and enables accurate evaluation of both  the precession frequency\n(used to adjust $B_{\\mathrm{bias}}$) and  the  resonance linewidth observed. The latter is the parameter to be minimised (see below) in the procedure devoted to reducing the field inhomogeneities.  \n\n\nFor short-time measurements, it is instead possible to modulate D$_1$L with a periodic signal near-resonant with the Larmor precession, and to infer the magnetic field from the dephasing of the polarimetric signal. This operation mode is referred to as \\textit{free-running}. It unavoidably suffers from slow drifts of the environmental field, which can eventually lead the system too far from the resonance. This problem is counteracted in a third operation mode (\\textit{locked mode}). In this case one of the polarimetric signals is used as an input   for  a\nphase-locked loop (PLL) to stabilise the magnetic field \\cite{belfi_rsi_10}. The environmental noise is reduced within the loop bandwidth, and this improves the noise rejection when performing differential measurements, as the spurious common mode noise terms are reduced.\n\n\n\nThe magnetometer  operates  in  bias  magnetic   fields  ranging  from\n$100~\\mbox{nT}$ to $6~\\mu\\mbox{T}$.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:line}  shows the  in-phase  and quadrature\nsignals of the Cs magnetic resonance as functions of  the  pump laser  modulation frequency, as recorded in the \\textit{scanning mode}.  The\n linewidth measured (half-width at half  maximum, HWHM) is of the order\nof 20~Hz and  is determined by the spin-exchange  collisions and power\nbroadening contributions. \n\nAs shown in the Appendix, this linewidth sets the response bandwidth of this kind of sensors, which --with the exception of some specific implementations \\cite{terao_pra_13}-- corresponds to the cut-off frequency of their response.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics [width=\\columnwidth] {fig4_line.eps}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Non-linear Faraday rotation of D$_2$L radiation (in-phase and quadrature components)   as  a   function  of   the  D$_1$L  modulation    frequency.

The best fit estimation of HWHM is 20~Hz under the optimal working conditions, in which the maximum Faraday rotation of $31^\\circ$.

This  is coarsely achieved  with permanent magnets  and then finely  adjusted with electromagnets. After such field inhomogeneity compensation, the resonance  narrowing  is   limited  --under  operative conditions-- by the spin-exchange collisions and pump and  probe excitation rates.

The green hatched band points out the time intervals when D$_1$L goes into resonance with an atomic line (rightmost red profile), and the blue dotted line represents the resulting pumping rate. The figure is not to scale, but is produced in accordance with the simple model described by eq.~\\ref{eq:modulazmodel}. In the text the maximal and minimal frequencies reached in the period will be referred to as \\textit{front}- and \\textit{back}-frequency, respectively.}\n\\label{fig:modulaz}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Atom-light interaction}\nThe D$_1$L optical frequency deviation amounts to tens of GHz, thus the radiation periodically goes in and out of resonance with given transitions of the D$_1$ line. \n\n\n\nLet us define the highest instantaneous optical frequency as \\textit{front} frequency and correspondingly the lowest one as \\textit{back} frequency (see Figs.~\\ref{fig:modulaz} and \\ref{fig:opt_pump}).  If the frequency deviation is kept constant,  when the \\textit{front} and the \\textit{back} frequencies increase, the amplitude and the width of the magnetic resonance change, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}. The probe laser is cw and tuned to be nearly resonant with the triplet $| ^2S_{1/2}, F_g=4 \\rangle \\rightarrow | ^2P_{3/2} \\rangle$, thus it probes the atomic precession of the $F_g=4$ state. When the D$_1$L approaches the D$_1$ line from the side of the $|^2S_{1/2}, F_g=3 \\rangle \\rightarrow | ^2P_{1/2}, F_e=4 \\rangle$ transition, the amplitude of the resonance increases, while its width remains almost constant. The amplitude shows two maxima occurring when the \\textit{front} frequency goes into resonance with the transitions \n$| ^2S_{1/2}, F_g=3 \\rangle \\rightarrow | ^2P_{1/2}, F_e=3,4 \\rangle $ (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}a)) and when the  \\textit{back} frequency goes into resonance with the $|^2S_{1/2}, F_g=4 \\rightarrow | ^2P_{1/2} \\rangle$ (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}b)), respectively.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics [width=\\columnwidth] {fig3_excitation.eps}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Amplitude and width of the observed resonance line  for a fixed D$_1$L modulation span, as a function of the front frequency. A square wave modulation signal with a duty cycle of $75\\%$ is applied. This  produces (see  Fig.~\\ref{fig:modulaz} and eq.~\\ref{eq:modulazmodel}) the instantaneous D$_1$L frequency represented by black lines in the insets, having a span of 11.2~GHz. Two amplitude maxima are observed when either (a) the front frequency is resonant with the leftmost hyperfine component or (b) the back frequency is resonant with the rightmost one. In  case (a) the resonance width is minimum, which makes this configuration the optimal working condition. The dashed lines correspond to intermediate detunings, at which no clear resonance line is observed.\n}\n\\label{fig:opt_pump}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWhen D$_1$L is near-resonant orresonant with the $F_g=4$ (either with its \\textit{front} or \\textit{back} frequency),  the resonance width increases dramatically untile the resonance is barely recognisable. In the rightmost region, when the back frequency is near-resonant with the $F_g=4$ (Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}b),  the resonance amplitude grows again (high-rate Zeeman optical pumping is performed), but the resonance is much broader. Moreover, in this condition a small red detuning results in an abrupt decrease in the signal amplitude, due to hyperfine optical pumping toward the unprobed $F_g=3$ ground state.  \n\n \n\n\\subsection{Sensitivity and optimal working conditions}\nThe modulation duty cycle, amplitude and offset are adjusted to ensure\nmaximum sensitivity. As seen from Fig.~\\ref{fig:opt_pump}, the best sensitivity is achieved when  the D$_1$L \\textit{front} frequency  is  resonant with the $|^2S_{1/2}, F_g=3  \\rangle \\rightarrow |^2P_{1/2}\\rangle$ hyperfine components  of the D$_1$ line. Concerning the probe laser, its optimal frequency is found to be 2~GHz blue detuned with respect to the triplet  $|^2S_{1/2},  F_g=4  \\rangle \\rightarrow  |^2P_{3/2}\\rangle$, which  is an acceptable compromise in order to achieve a good Faraday rotation signal and small excitation rate. \n\n\nUnder these conditions, the pump laser plays two roles: it causes a strong hyperfine optical pumping of the Cs atoms towards the  ground state analysed, and simultaneously pumps the atoms into a specific Zeeman sublevel of that state, due to its circular polarisation.   \nThe combination of these two effects ensures a high amplitude and small linewidth of the resonance, also thanks to the effect known as light narrowing \\cite{appelt_pra_99, scholtes_pra_11}. The linewidth is also narrow  thanks to the fact that the  hyperfine ground state measured is weakly perturbed, because D$_1$L is  either far off-resonance or resonant with the other (depleted)  hyperfine  ground  state.\n\nThe Zeeman  pumping produces magnetisation of the Cs vapour along the wave-vector ($x$ direction). As the magnetic  field is transverse to the pump light propagation ($y$ direction), the   atomic state where atoms are pumped evolves  in  time. At a macroscopic scale this corresponds to  a magnetisation  precession in the  $xz$ plane at an angular frequency $\\omega_L$, which is set by the magnetic field modulus $B$ and the gyromagnetic factor $\\gamma$: $\\omega_L = \\gamma B$.  Clearly detectable precessing magnetisation is obtained, again at the macroscopic level, when the pump radiation interacts with the atoms synchronously with the precession. \n\n\n\n\\section{Operation modes, field range, resonance linewidth}\n\\label{sec:operation}\nThe atomic precession is detected by analysing the Faraday rotation of\na weak linearly  polarised  probe  beam,  propagating  in  the  $x$\ndirection.  As it is well known, the linear probe beam  polarisation can be decomposed into two  $\\sigma^+$ and $\\sigma^-$ counter-rotating circular polarisation  components, which  experience  opposite variations to the respective refractive indexes, due to the atomic spin precession. These two  circular components  eventually recombine,  with  time-dependent relative  dephasing,  into a linear  polarisation, which is rotated  by an angle  oscillating  at the  precession  frequency.   Beside the different dispersions,  the  $\\sigma^+$ and  $\\sigma^-$  components experience  also different levels of absorption,  but the relevance of this  aspect is  limited by appropriately detuning the probe  laser from the  centre of the atomic resonance.\n\nThe polarimetric signal can be analysed as a function of the D$_1$L modulation frequency in order to characterise  the   atomic  magnetic\nresonance, in an operation mode that is referred to as \\textit{scanning mode} and enables accurate evaluation of both  the precession frequency\n(used to adjust $B_{\\mathrm{bias}}$) and  the  resonance linewidth observed. The latter is the parameter to be minimised (see below) in the procedure devoted to reducing the field inhomogeneities.  \n\n\nFor short-time measurements, it is instead possible to modulate D$_1$L with a periodic signal near-resonant with the Larmor precession, and to infer the magnetic field from the dephasing of the polarimetric signal. This operation mode is referred to as \\textit{free-running}. It unavoidably suffers from slow drifts of the environmental field, which can eventually lead the system too far from the resonance. This problem is counteracted in a third operation mode (\\textit{locked mode}). In this case one of the polarimetric signals is used as an input   for  a\nphase-locked loop (PLL) to stabilise the magnetic field \\cite{belfi_rsi_10}. The environmental noise is reduced within the loop bandwidth, and this improves the noise rejection when performing differential measurements, as the spurious common mode noise terms are reduced.\n\n\n\nThe magnetometer  operates  in  bias  magnetic   fields  ranging  from\n$100~\\mbox{nT}$ to $6~\\mu\\mbox{T}$.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:line}  shows the  in-phase  and quadrature\nsignals of the Cs magnetic resonance as functions of  the  pump laser  modulation frequency, as recorded in the \\textit{scanning mode}.  The\n linewidth measured (half-width at half  maximum, HWHM) is of the order\nof 20~Hz and  is determined by the spin-exchange  collisions and power\nbroadening contributions. \n\nAs shown in the Appendix, this linewidth sets the response bandwidth of this kind of sensors, which --with the exception of some specific implementations \\cite{terao_pra_13}-- corresponds to the cut-off frequency of their response.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics [width=\\columnwidth] {fig4_line.eps}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Non-linear Faraday rotation of D$_2$L radiation (in-phase and quadrature components)   as  a   function  of   the  D$_1$L  modulation    frequency.

The best fit estimation of HWHM is 20~Hz under the optimal working conditions, in which the maximum Faraday rotation of $31^\\circ$. A narrower line (10~Hz) is obtained at lower temperatures and lower excitation rates, at the expenses of a much smaller rotation ($0.6^\\circ$).}\n\\label{fig:line}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe direction of the bias magnetic field is set  with the help  of three\npairs    of     1.8~m    side    square     Helmholtz    coils    (see\nRefs.  \\cite{belfi_josab_07,  belfi_rsi_10}  for additional  details).\nThe magnetic field Jacobian,  $G_{ij}=\\partial B_i / \\partial x_j$, is\nzeroed  using five quadrupole devices, taking  specific  care with  the\n$\\partial  B_y  / \\partial  x_i$  elements,  which cause static inhomogeneities of $\\delta B_{\\lVert}$ and thus most affect  the performance.  This  is coarsely achieved  with permanent magnets  and then finely  adjusted with electromagnets. After such field inhomogeneity compensation, the resonance  narrowing  is   limited  --under  operative conditions-- by the spin-exchange collisions and pump and  probe excitation rates. As a matter of fact, when operating at very low Cs densities and excitation rates (at about $10^\\circ$~C), resonances as narrow as $6$~Hz are recorded.\n\n\nIn the \\textit{free-running} and \\textit{locked} modes the field variations are inferred from phase estimations of the polarimetric signal.

The environmental (common mode) noise-rejection permits the achievement of a noise level as low as a 100~fT/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$ .\n\n\n\\appendix\n\\section{Polarimetric signal phase}\n\\label{sec:appendix}\nThis appendix is devoted to esplicating the conditions and the consequent approximations considered in order to infer time-dependent magnetic field variations from the phase of the polarimetric signal.\n\nWe refer to the geometry of the experiment reported in Fig.~\\ref{fig:setup}\nand we assume that the magnetic field is a superposition of two parallel terms: a dominant static term (bias) and a small periodic one\n", "index": 7, "text": "\n\\[\n\\mathbf{B}(t)  =   (B_{\\mathrm {bias}}  +  \\delta B_{\\lVert}(t)) \\hat{y}, \n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathbf{B}(t)=(B_{\\mathrm{bias}}+\\delta B_{\\lVert}(t))\\hat{y},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc01</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>B</mi><mi>bias</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">\u2225</mo></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06938.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere  $\\omega$ is  the laser  modulation frequency.
