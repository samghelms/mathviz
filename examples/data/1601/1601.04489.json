Using active gel equations, which include cell division, we show that shape changes during the growth can be regulated by the dynamics of topological defects in the orientation of cells. The friction between the dividing cells and underlying substrate drives anisotropic colony shapes toward more isotropic morphologies, by mediating the number density and velocity of topological defects. We show that the defects interact with the interface at a specific interaction range, set by the vorticity length scale of flows within the colony, and that the cells predominantly reorient parallel to the interface due to division-induced active stresses. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\nGrowth dynamics is of considerable importance in biological processes, from biofilm formation \\cite{Hall2004} to morphogenesis \\cite{Haas2006}, tissue spreading \\cite{Ghosh2007}, and tumor invasion \\cite{Wolgemuth2011}. \n\nA prominent feature during the growth of these systems is the emergence of coordinated motion of constituent cells, which may be affected by several mechanisms such as biological signalling between the cells \\cite{Haas2006}, chemical cues \\cite{Tse2012,Ramin2015}, and mechanical stimuli \\cite{TrepatRev}.\n\nRecent experimental studies of bacterial colonies and cellular assemblies show growing evidence of an important role of mechanical factors in regulating growth and in determining collective migration  \\cite{Cicuta2014,Rosalind2015a,Rosalind2015b,Trepat2009,Tambe2011,Vedula2012,Doxzen2013,Lene2013,Lene2015}.\n\nIn particular, the emergence of the collective motion of cells is often connected to the generation of active stresses by molecular motors and actin polymerisation dynamics and by cell division \\cite{Joanny2010,Rossen2014,oursSM2015}. \n\nWithin this context cellular assemblies and bacterial colonies can be modelled as active gels, and the equations of active nematic liquid crystals have been shown to reproduce several experimental observations such as the collective migration of cells \\cite{Julicher2008,Julicher2009,Prost2015} and the flow fields of dividing cells \\cite{oursSM2015}. \n\nThe relevance of nematic models is highlighted in {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:exp}}}}, which shows a snapshot of a dividing {\\it E. coli} colony. The orientation field of the rod-shaped {\\it E. coli} shows clear local nematic order, corresponding to alignment of the bacteria. \n{\\it Topological defects} can also be identified. Such defects cannot be removed by a local realignment of the orientation, and at a defect core the ordering is destroyed.  The strength of a defect is measured as the change in the nematic orientation following a closed curve around the defect core \\cite{DeGennesBook}. Therefore $\\pm{1}/{2}$ defects, identified in {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:exp}}}}, correspond to $\\pm\\pi$ rotations of the bacterial orientation around the defect. Note also the preferential alignment of the cells tangential to the surface. The emergence of nematic order and topological defects have been reported for bacterial colonies \\cite{Poon2015}, cultures of fibroblast \\cite{Wasoff1976,Silberzan2014}, in living amoeboid cells \\cite{Gruler1999}, and more recently in \n\nMadin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells \\cite{Benoit}.\n\n~However, to the best of our knowledge, the role of topological defects in growth dynamics and their connections to the morphological responses of cell cultures have not yet been explored.\n\\begin{figure}[tdp]\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0 0 0 0, clip, width=0.5\\linewidth]{Fig1.pdf}\n\\caption{A growing {\\it E. coli} colony shows nematic ordering, $\\pm {1}/{2}$ topological defects and tangential alignment to the interface  \n\n(Picture courtesy of Lin Chao, to whom all rights are reserved).\n}\n\\label{fig:exp}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nHere, we show how the dynamics of topological defects contribute to shape changes in growing colonies of dividing cells. Building on the active gel description of cellular layers \\cite{Prost2015,oursSM2015}, we show that the progression of the interface of a growing colony and its morphological properties are correlated with the generation of defects and their associated dynamics. \n\nIn addition, we relate friction between cells and the underlying substrate to conformational changes based on the increase in the number of defects and reduction of their velocities with increasing friction.\n\n\n\n\n~\\\\\nTo represent the dynamics of a growing colony, we use a continuum description of cells as an active gel growing in an  isotropic liquid \\cite{Kruse2005,Joanny2007,Volfson2008,MatthewPRL,oursSM2015}.

The time evolution of the colony is shown in {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:shape}}}} for low and high friction. At low friction the colony's shape is characterised by a number of finger-like protrusions reaching into the isotropic liquid. At higher friction the fingering is greatly reduced and the shape of the colony remains close to circular. \n\n\nA quantitative measure of the shape change can be obtained by calculating the isoperimetric quotient of the growing colony IQ$=4\\pi\\mathcal{A}/\\mathcal{P}^{2}$, where $\\mathcal{A}$ is the surface area and $\\mathcal{P}$ is the perimeter of the cell assembly. For a perfect circular geometry IQ$=1$, and it decreases as the shape deviates from a circle. \n\nAt zero friction, the IQ drops rapidly as the initial circular geometry is perturbed by defect-induced protrusions [Fig.~\\ref{fig:iq}(a), {\\it red data}] before flattening to an asymptotic value for longer times. The higher IQ measured for larger friction indicates the tendency towards forming a more circular morphology [Fig.~\\ref{fig:iq}(a), {\\it cyan line}].\n\nThe positions of $\\pm1/2$ topological defects are also shown in {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:shape}}}}. \nThe defects can be identified by calculating the diffusive charge density \\cite{MatthewPRL}, $s=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q_{xx}}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial Q_{xy}}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial Q_{xx}}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial Q_{xy}}{\\partial x}\\right)$,\n\n\n\nwhich gives $s=\\pm 1/2$ at the position of defect cores.\nIt is apparent from {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:shape}}}}, and known from previous work \\cite{SumeshPRE2014,oursNM2015}, that the number of defects in an active nematic increases with friction [{\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:iq}}}}(b), {\\it red data}].

Defects can either be created at the interface (defects 1 and 4) due to surface undulations, leaving a net negative charge on the interface, or appear as a pair in the bulk (defect pair 2--3) to release elastic energy associated with the orientation field. Once created, comet-like $+1/2$ defects move through the colony and either annihilate with the oppositely charged defects in the bulk (defect 4 annihilates with defect 3) or approach the interface (defects 1 and 2). \nAs a defect moves towards the interface the dynamic progression of the border adapts to the motion of the approaching defect until it reaches the surface and annihilates with the negative charge density that is distributed along the interface. This suggests that the shape of the colony will be correlated to the motion of the defects and it is apparent from {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:exp}}}} and {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:shape}}}} that finger-like protrusions are closely linked to the motion of comet-like (+1/2) topological defects.\n\nWhen the friction between cells and the underlying substrate is small, topological defects moving towards the border and the consequent protrusions are few in number and energetic,  and the shape of a growing assembly is highly anisotropic [Fig.~\\ref{fig:shape}, {\\it top row}]. However, as the friction is enhanced, the number of topological defects increases and the average defect velocity is reduced resulting in a more isotropic morphology [Fig.~\\ref{fig:shape}, {\\it bottom row}]. \n\n\n\nTo obtain a more quantitative characterisation of the connection between the movement of topological defects and the progression of the interface, we define the cross-correlation function between defect and interface velocities $C_{D-I}(r)=\\langle {\\boldsymbol{{v}}}_{D}(r,t)\\cdot {\\boldsymbol{{v}}}_{I}(r,t)\\rangle/\\langle {\\boldsymbol{{v}}}_{D}(0,t) \\cdot {\\boldsymbol{{v}}}_{I}(0,t)\\rangle$, where ${\\boldsymbol{{v}}}_{D}=\\Delta d_{D}/\\Delta t$ denotes the defect velocity and ${\\boldsymbol{{v}}}_{I}=\\Delta d_{I}/\\Delta t$ is the velocity of the point on the interface at a distance $r$ from the defect  in the direction of ${\\boldsymbol{{v}}}_{D}$ [see Fig.~\\ref{fig:corr}(b), {\\it inset}]. The measurement of this cross-correlation function demonstrates that the defect and interface displacements are correlated over a given distance, which we term the {\\it interaction range} [Fig.~\\ref{fig:corr}(b)]. The interaction range decreases as the friction is increased. \n\nTo determine the physical mechanism for the emergence of the interaction range and its dependence on the friction, we consider the flow field and director configuration around a defect approaching the interface [Fig.~\\ref{fig:corr}(c)]. As evident from the figure the motion of the defect sets up counter-rotating velocity vortices \\cite{Julia2002,ourprl2013,Giomi2013,Giomi2014}. \n\nWe conjecture that the interaction range is controlled by the vorticity length scale in the growing colony. To show that this is indeed the case we calculate the  characteristic vorticity length scale from the vorticity-vorticity correlation function and compare it to the interaction range for different frictions [Fig.~\\ref{fig:corr}(b), {\\it dashed lines}]. The close agreement between the length scales associated with the vorticity and the defect-interface interaction range shows that the defect motion towards the interface affects the interface deformation through vortex generation around a defect. As the friction is increased the vorticity field is more effectively suppressed by hydrodynamic screening and therefore the characteristic vorticity length is reduced \\cite{oursNM2015}, leading to a shorter interaction range between defects and the interface [Fig.~\\ref{fig:corr}(b)]. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[hdp]\n\n\n\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0 10 0 0, clip, width=0.5\\linewidth]{Fig5.pdf}\n\\caption{Dividing cells align along the free surface: distribution of anchoring angle relative to the surface for different frictions.}\n\\label{fig:anch}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interesting feature observed during the simulated growth of the cell colony is that cells at the border tend to lie parallel to the interface. This is quantified by plotting the distribution of the anchoring angle relative to the interface of the outermost cells [Fig.~\\ref{fig:anch}]. Similar behaviour is evident in {\\textbf{Fig.~\\ref{{fig:exp}}}} and in the experiments reported in \\cite{Volfson2008}. In a recent study of \nlyotropic active nematics Blow {\\it et al.} \\cite{MatthewPRL} showed that the gradients in order and orientation of nematogens along an interface result in the generation of activity-induced anchoring forces which, for extensile active nematics, induce tangential orientations along the interface. Since the cell division generates extensile stresses \\cite{oursSM2015}, we expect the same mechanism to be responsible for the anchoring along the border of a growing colony.\n\nIt has been shown recently that by increasing the adhesion between the cells and substrate the spreading of cell aggregates is enhanced: groups of cells are formed in the shape of finger-like structures leading to anisotropic shapes \\cite{Ravasio2015}. This was interpreted in terms of `leader' cells at the end of the fingers. By contrast previous theoretical predictions have associated the fingering to the curvature dependent motility of cells \\cite{Silberzan2010} or undulation instabilities due to cell proliferation in epithelial tissues \\cite{Basan2011,Prost2015b}, neglecting the orientational order of cells. Here, we offer an alternative, collective physical mechanism for such morphological changes based on the dynamics of topological defects in a growing colony. \nTo test these ideas the friction between cells and their underlying substrate could be used to vary the number of defects in active systems \\cite{SumeshPRE2014,oursNM2015,Francesc2015}.  A potential approach would be to consider a fixed amount of Fibronectine (FB) proteins, which control cell binding to the substrate, and explore the spreading dynamics on substrates with varying stiffness to introduce differing hydrodynamic screening \\cite{Benoit}. \nIndeed recent experiments do show the role of friction in pattern formation in active matter \\cite{Hannezo2015,Francesc2015} and demonstrate important connections between the friction and cell motility \\cite{Paluch2015}.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have described a new physical mechanism for understanding morphological changes in growing colonies based on the dynamics of topological defects in cell orientations. \n\nSuch defects have been recently observed experimentally \\cite{Poon2015,Benoit} and our results suggest directions for further investigations of defect-mediated migration and morphologies in cellular colonies.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nWe acknowledge funding from the ERC Advanced Grant (MiCE 291234).
