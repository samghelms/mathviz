Despite\nthe apparent simplicity of the problem, there are still many\nunsolved questions concerning the exact mechanisms controlling the\nmotion in these systems, such as the transition from static to rolling\nfriction, the role of surface elasticity, or the hydrodynamical interaction between the fluid  and the moving object.\n\nDuring the last decade, this type of problem has gained some renewed\ninterest in the field of microfluidics. For instance,  biomedical applications involve microrobots such as artificial micro-swimmers made of super-paramagnetic beads subject to an external magnetic field \\cite{Peyer2013,Pamme2006}. \nIn some cases (so-called 'surface walkers'), it has been reported that actuation of the microrobot can be controlled by the presence of a surface wall \\cite{Sing2010,Karle2011}.\nOn the other hand, the problem of particles transported by electromagnetic waves is widely studied in  the framework of the plasma-electrons interaction. Surprisingly, only few studies have been done on electromagnetic control of\nparticles on macroscopic scales \\cite{Bolcato93}.\nIn this letter, we focus on the motion of macroscopic magnetic beads on a flat horizontal surface driven by the magnetic\nforce due to a travelling wave. \\\\\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width= 7cm]{figure/schema1.eps} }\n          \n\\caption{Experimental set-up. A  bead moves on a flat surface under the effect of\n    a traveling magnetic wave created by $16$ Neodymium magnets located on a rotating disc.}\n\\label{schema}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Experiment}\n\nFig.\\ref{schema}-left shows a schematic picture of the experiment: a\nspherical bead is placed on a fixed horizontal plane made of methyl-methacrylate (plexiglass)\nof width $a_p=5$mm. The bead, of radius $a$, is made either of\nweakly ferromagnetic mild steel  or Neodymium NdFeB (permanent magnet) depending on the experiments and can freely move on the surface. At a distance $h$ below the plane is located a rotating disc\ncontaining $16$ Neodymium magnets disposed with a regular spacing\nalong a circle of radius $R=83$mm. These magnets are cylinders of\ndiameter $d_m=20$mm and height $h_m=10$mm, generating a magnetic field\nof $B_m^0=0.45T$ at their surface. The magnets are arranged such that two\nadjacent magnets, separated by a distance $d_m=2\\pi R/16=32.5$mm, are\noriented with opposite polarity. This rotating disc therefore\ngenerates a sinusoidal magnetic field propagating in the azimutal direction with a pulsation\n$\\omega=2\\pi f_d/16$ and a wavenumber $k=\\pi/d_m$, where $f_d$ is the\nrotation rate of the disc.\n The bead therefore moves with a velocity $V$ (normalized by the wave speed $c$) under the influence of this travelling magnetic field along circular trajectories which are\nrecorded by a fast camera located on the top of the set-up. By changing the distance $h$ between the rotating disc and\nthe fixed plate, one can also experimentally vary the magnitude of the magnetic field applied to the sphere. \n\n\nFigure \\ref{hysteresis} shows the evolution of the normalized\nvelocity $V$ of a mild steel bead of radius $a=3$mm as a function of\nthe  wave speed $c$. At small disc frequency, the bead moves in\nsynchronism with the wave ($V=1$, upper branch). This synchronous translation is relatively intuitive: under the effect of the applied field, the magnetized bead is trapped inside the potential well of one of the\nmagnet of the disc. As the disc rotates, the  sphere therefore slides above the magnet without\nrolling and keeps its magnetic moment aligned with the local field (time series in the inset figure, black curve, for $c=3$m.s$^{-1}$). \n\nHowever, for larger wave speed ($c>5$m.s$ ^{-1}$), the system suddenly\nbifurcates to a very different solution, in which the bead now \npropagates in the {\\it backward} direction related to the driving\nwave  (typical time series in green, for $c=6.3$m.s$^{-1}$).\n Note that this backward motion is in this case slower than the wave speed ($V\\sim\n-0.4$), and  slightly decreases with $c$.\n\nIf the wave speed is decreased from this new state, the transition back to synchronous positive translation is obtained for much smaller velocity, thus showing that this bifurcation is\nsubcritical and associated with a strong hysteresis.\n\nFor some parameters, the bistability between these two solutions can\nyield complex non-linear behavior. The red curve in the inset of Fig.\\ref{hysteresis} \nshows a time series obtained for $h=8$mm, $a=2.5$mm, $c=0.68$m.s$^{-1}$. For these\nparameters, both positive and negative $V$ solutions are accessible and\nthe system undergoes chaotic switches between the two branches.\\\\\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width= 9 cm]{figure/hysteresis4.eps} }\n\\caption{Bifurcation diagram of the velocity $V$ of a mild steel bead\n  of radius $a=3$mm and disc/plate distance $h=4$mm.

Typical time series\n  are shown in inset (see text). }\n\\label{hysteresis}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn fact, the evolution of the counter-propagative solution strongly\ndepends on the parameters used in the experiment. Fig.\\ref{bifs} shows\nthe evolution of $-V$ (only the negative solution is shown) as a function of $c$ for $h=10$mm and for different values of the sphere radius. For the smallest value of $a$, the velocity $V$ is constant,\nwhereas it systematically decreases with $c$ for larger $a$. Note that the\nmaximum velocity reached by the sphere first increases with $a$,\nbefore decreasing for the largest values of $a$. For $a=6$mm, this\nmaximum velocity reaches $V=-1.2$ (for $c=0.5$m.s$^{-1}$), meaning\nthat the bead is travelling backward {\\it faster} than the magnetic\nwave driving its motion.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width= 9 cm]{figure/bif.eps} }\n\\caption{Velocity of counter-propagative beads as a function\n  of the wave speed $c$, for $h=10$mm.

For simplicity, we used $C_D=1$ in the following.

In the following, $\\mu=0.02$ is used, which is slightly smaller than the value expected for a lubricated metal-plastic interface.\n\nFigure \\ref{rescaling} shows our experimental data for mild steel beads compared to the\nmodel described above. In this figure, bead velocities have been rescaled by the backward solution $V_0$ (eq.\\ref{solutionA}) and plotted as a function of our dimensionless number $N$. Although it involves a variety of values for $h$ and $a$, our experimental data show a very good\nagreement with both  solutions (\\ref{solutionA}) and (\\ref{solutionB}),\nrepresented by the dashed lines.

Moreover, the data are \nspread around the backward-rolling solution. In particular, note that\nsome experiments involve backward velocities several times faster than $V_0$ as $N$ is reduced. The inset of Fig.\\ref{rescaling2}, which focus on the\ntrajectory obtained for $h=8$mm and $a=3$mm, shows that\nthis departure is due to a more complex trajectory than the\none-dimensional motion used during the model derivation: the bead\nstarts oscillating radially around its circular trajectory. It is interesting\nto note that this type of motion which involves a complex interaction\nbetween the magnetic restoring force  and the inertia of\nthe sphere, can increase the velocity of the bead even further . Clearly, this motion would require a modification of our 1-D model, which is beyond the scope of this paper. \n\nAdditional experiments were done using beads made of copper: in this non-magnetic case, a similar counter-motion is observed, although one order of magnitude smaller than the one reported here for magnetic spheres. In this case, eddy currents in the sphere produce weaker but similar forces than the magnetic ones described here, thus leading to identical behavior. Finally, note that by adding random noise in equations (\\ref{eq1})-(\\ref{eq2}), these equations easily explain the origin of the chaotic  behavior reported in Fig.\\ref{hysteresis}: it originates from imperfections of the bottom surface, generating noise in the friction and allowing random transitions between the two bistable forward/backward solutions. \\\\% ( forward synchronous translation with no rotation -  backward translation with  synchronous angular rotation).\\\\\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nThe motion of a magnetized sphere driven by an external travelling magnetic field has been studied. When the speed of the driving wave is large enough, we observe a transition from a state involving a forward synchronous translation with no rotation, to a backward translation associated to synchronous angular rotation. Under several assumptions, a simple model was proposed to explain this backward motion, which can be several times faster than the driving wave. A good agreement is obtained between the theory and experimental data.\n\nThe behavior reported in this paper may have several applications. First, the present experiment shares some similarities with recent studies on the control of magnetic beads in microfluidic channel \\cite{Karle2011},\\cite{Mahonet2011} and  may therefore be regarded as a new method for manipulating nano-microscale objects using the tumbling motion of particles induced by a travelling magnetic wave. Rolling of a small magnetic particle can also be relevant  to micromanipulation of magnetic beads for magnetic twizzer \\cite{Yan2004} or polishing techniques.  It is also interesting that the present mechanism offers a simple  explanation to counter-flows  observed near boundaries  in ferrofluids submitted to a rotating magnetic field. On the other hand, the mechanism of locomotion described here is very general, and may be applied to controlled transport of objects at macroscopic scales. In this perspective, several questions may be addressed in future work, such as the role of electrical conductivity  or the factors limiting the stability of the counter-propagative solution.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\nThe author is thankful to S.
