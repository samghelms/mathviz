A characteristic feature of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates~(BECs) is their geometry-dependent \nstability~\\cite{Koch2008}. If the condensate is elongated along the dipole orientation, the DDI are attractive in average, \nand the BEC may become unstable, in a similar, but not identical, way as a BEC with negative $s$-wave scattering length, $a<0$. \nChromium experiments showed that, as for $a<0$, the unstable BEC collapses, albeit with a peculiar $d$-wave post-collapse dynamics~\\cite{Lahaye2008}.\n\n\nThis picture has been challenged by recent dysprosium experiments~\\cite{Kadau2015}, in which destabilization, induced by a quench to a sufficiently low $a$, is not followed by collapse, but rather by the formation of \nstable droplets that are only destroyed in a large time scale by weak three-body losses~(3BL). \nThis surprising result, which resembles the Rosensweig instability in ferrofluids~\\cite{Cowley1967,Timonen2013}, points to an up to now unknown stabilization mechanism that \nplays a similar role as that of surface tension in classical ferrofluids. It has been recently suggested that large conservative three-body forces, with a strength \nseveral orders of magnitude larger than the 3BL, may account for the observation~\\cite{Xi2015,Bisset2015}. There is however no justification of why large \nthree-body forces should be present, or whether there is a link between them and the DDI.\n\n\nThis Letter explores an alternative mechanism, based on quantum fluctuations, which is suggested by very recent experiments~\\cite{Pfau-Private}. \nAs recently shown~\\cite{Petrov2015}, Lee-Huang-Yang~(LHY) corrections may stabilize \ndroplets in unstable Bose-Bose mixtures. This interesting effect results from the presence of soft and hard elementary excitations. Whereas soft modes may become \nunstable, quantum fluctuations of the hard modes may balance the instability, resulting in an equilibrium droplet. As shown below,  due to the anisotropy of the DDI, \na dipolar BEC also presents soft and hard modes, characterized in free space by momenta perpendicular or parallel to the dipole orientation. \nAs a result, the LHY correction resulting from the hard modes provides a repulsive term that dominates at large densities arresting local collapses, resulting in \nthe nucleation of droplets~(see Figs.~\\ref{fig:1}). We show by means of a generalized nonlocal non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation~(NLNLSE)  that this mechanism \naccounts for the Dy experiments. We stress that this effect results from the peculiar nature of the DDI, being hence a characteristic novel feature of strongly dipolar gases, which \nshould play an important role in future experiments with highly magnetic atoms and polar molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure1.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace*{-0.4cm}\n\\caption{(Color online) Crystal-like droplet arrangements of $n_{XY}(x,y)/N$, with $n_{XY}(x,y)=\\int dz\\, n({\\mathbf r})$, for a BEC of N=7500 atoms~(top), and 15000 atoms~(bottom), \ninitially formed with $a=120a_B$, $20$ms after a quench to $a=70a_B$.}\n\\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Generalized NLNLSE--}  We consider a BEC of magnetic dipoles of mass m and dipole moment ${\\boldsymbol \\mu}$ oriented along the \n$z$ direction by an external magnetic field~(equivalent results can be found for electric dipoles).

The droplets discussed below are in the TF regime \nalong the dipole direction in all cases, whereas only large droplets are in the TF regime also along $xy$. \nFor small droplets, with less than $4000$ atoms in the calculations below, the $xy$ density profile approaches rather a Gaussian.  \nWe may evaluate the contribution of quasi-classical excitations with momenta $\\mathbf{k}$, such that \n$|\\mathbf{k}| R(\\theta_k)\\gg 1$ where $R(\\theta_k)$ is a typical distance for density variation in the droplet along the direction given by the angle $\\theta_k$. \nThis contribution is for the smallest droplets presented below of the order of $\\sim 80\\%$ of the total LHY correction expected from LDA~(for details of this estimation see \\cite{footnote-cutoff}). \nThe correction due to long wave-length modes \nmay hence modify the prefactor of the correction, but the bulk of the effect is well recovered by Eq.~\\eqref{eq:gNLNLSE}. \nWe postpone for a future analysis the detailed study of the effect of long wavelength excitations. \nIn addition, the validity of the generalized NLNLSE demands a small quantum depletion~\\cite{Lima2011,Lima2012}, \n$\\eta({\\mathbf r})\\equiv \\frac{\\Delta n({\\mathbf r})}{n({\\mathbf r})}=\\frac{8}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\sqrt{n({\\mathbf r})a^3}F_D(\\epsilon_{dd})$, \nwith $F_D(\\epsilon_{dd})=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\theta_k \\sin{\\theta_k} f(\\epsilon_{dd},\\theta_k)^{3/2}$.  \nIn our simulations, $\\eta({\\mathbf r})\\lesssim 0.01$ at any point and time.\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Droplet nucleation--} \nIn the following we employ Eq.~\\eqref{eq:gNLNLSE} to study the formation of BEC droplets in recent Dy experiments~\\cite{Kadau2015}. \nWe consider a BEC with $N$ Dy atoms, with $|{\\boldsymbol \\mu}|=10\\mu_B$, with $\\mu_B$ the Bohr magneton. In order to compare our results with recent \nexperiments we assume  a trap with\n$\\omega_{x,y,z}/2\\pi=(44,46,133)$Hz~\\cite{footnote-trap}. \nWe employ imaginary time evolution of Eq.~\\eqref{eq:gNLNLSE} to form an initial BEC with $a=120a_B$, with $a_B$ the Bohr radius. Under these conditions the BEC, with a wavefunction $\\psi_0({\\mathbf r})$, is stable and in the TF regime. \nAt finite temperature, $T$, thermal fluctuations seed the modulational instability after the quench of $a$ discussed below, and may hence influence droplet nucleation. \nFollowing Ref.~\\cite{Bisset2015} we add thermal fluctuations~(for $T=20$nK) in the form $\\psi({\\mathbf r},t=0)=\\psi_0({\\mathbf r})+\\sum_n\\alpha_n\\phi_n$, where $\\phi_n$ are eigenmodes of the \nharmonic trap with eigenenergies $\\epsilon_n$, the sum is restricted to $\\epsilon_n<2k_B T$, and $\\alpha_n$ is a complex Gaussian random variable \nwith $\\langle |\\alpha_n|^2\\rangle= \\frac{1}{2}+(e^{\\epsilon_n/k_B T}-1)^{-1}$~\\cite{footnote-SGPE}.\n\nAt $t=0$ we perform a quench in $0.5$ms to a final $a=70 a_B$ that \ndestabilizes the BEC~\\cite{footnote-a}. The most unstable Bogoliubov mode has a non-zero angular momentum, a so-called angular roton~\\cite{Ronen2007}, and  \nas a result at $T=0$ the BEC develops an initial ring-like modulational instability on the $xy$ plane, followed by azimuthal symmetry breaking into droplets. \nAt finite $T$ droplets may nucleate from thermal fluctuations \nbefore the ring-like structure associated with the angular-roton instability develops~(as it is observed in experiments~\\cite{Pfau-Private-2}). \nBoth cases are characterized by the formation of stable droplets in few ms, which eventually arrange in a quasi-crystalline structure as those of Figs.~\\ref{fig:1}, in excellent agreement with \nthe experimental results of Ref.~\\cite{Kadau2015}. \nDroplet nucleation does not involve however the whole condensate. \nA significant amount of atoms remains in a halo-like background too dilute to gather particles into a stable droplet~(approximately $30\\%$ in Figs.~\\ref{fig:1}, although it is barely visible \ndue to the contrast).\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Droplet features --} The droplets result from the compensation of the attractive MF term $\\mu_0\\propto n({\\mathbf r})$ by\nthe effective repulsion introduced by the LHY term, $\\Delta\\mu\\propto n({\\mathbf r})^{3/2}$. In order to study the properties of individual droplets, we \nevolve Eq.~\\eqref{eq:gNLNLSE} in imaginary time for $a=70a_B$ and different particle numbers. In order to guarantee the controlled formation of a single droplet in the numerics, we employ as initial condition \nfor the imaginary time evolution a cigar-like Gaussian wavefunction at the trap center very compressed on the $xy$ plane~\\cite{footnote-initial} . \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure2.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace*{-0.2cm}\n\\caption{(Color online) Droplet energy, $E_D$~(in units of $\\hbar\\tilde\\omega$, with $\\tilde\\omega=(\\omega_x\\omega_y\\omega_z)^{1/3}$) as a function of the number of particles in the droplet, $N_D$, \nfor $a=70a_B$; for $N_D<N_{min}\\simeq 900$ no stable droplet is found.

At the center of the droplet,  $n(0,0,z)\\propto (1-z^2/Z^2)^{2/3}$~(dotted curve).}\n\\label{fig:2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:2} shows the droplet energy, $E_D$, as a function of the number of particles in the droplet, $N_D$. Two important features are worth mentioning. \nThere is a minimal particle number, $N_{min}\\simeq 900$, such that for $N_D<N_{min}$ \nno stable droplet may form.  If the local density does not allow for the gathering of that critical number, then no \ndroplet is formed, accounting for the background halo. Second, $E_D(N_D)$ presents a non-monotonous dependence with $N$, showing a minimum~(at $N_D\\simeq 13000$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig:2}), being only \npositive at $N_D$ values close to $N_{min}$~($E_D=0$ at $N_D\\simeq 1500$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig:2}). This is particularly relevant for the droplet nucleation after a quench. \nAfter the quench, the BEC energy, which is initially positive~\\cite{footnote-Energy},  is almost conserved, just decreasing slowly due to 3BL. The final droplet gas is characterized by the internal energy of the droplets, the center of mass~(CM), kinetic and potential, energy of the droplets, and the inter-droplet dipole-dipole repulsion (the \nhalo, being much more dilute has a comparatively small contribution to the BEC energy). Although the CM energy and the repulsive inter-droplet interaction are obviously positive, they \ncannot balance a negative internal energy of the droplets, as required by the quasi-conservation of the energy  in the absence of strong dissipation. This explains why, as discussed below, in the quench experiments droplets form with particle numbers between $900$ and $1500$, despite the fact that bigger droplets could be in principle stable~(Fig.~\\ref{fig:2}).\n\nThe shape of the droplets is also significant for the overall discussion. \nThe droplets are markedly elongated along the dipole direction. For $N_D\\simeq 1000$, the $z$ half-size is $\\simeq 2\\mu$m, whereas along $xy$ is $\\lesssim 0.3\\mu$m. \nThis is expected, since a cigar-like shape is required for an attractive DDI that overwhelms the repulsive \ncontact MF term. In addition, as mentioned above, the droplets are \nin any case well within the TF regime along the $z$ direction~(see the inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig:2} for $N_D=1000$). Large droplets, with $N_D>8000$, are also well within the TF regime along the $xy$ direction. \nOn the contrary as already noted, small droplets with $N_D<4000$ have approximately a Gaussian profile along $xy$. \nThis remains true for the droplets found in the simulations of quench experiments. \nQuantum pressure is hence non-negligible for small droplets, but it is not crucial for the droplet stability, which is provided by the compensation of the attractive MF interaction and the LHY correction.\nThis is in stark contrast with self-bound solitons that require necessarily quantum pressure to compensate attractive interactions, and hence cannot occur in any case in the TF regime. \nDue to the LHY term, the droplets do not present an inverted-paraboloid profile even in the TF regime.  At the center,\n$n(x=0,y=0,z)\\simeq (1-z^2/Z^2)^{2/3}$~(inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig:2}). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure3.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace*{-0.2cm}\n\\caption{(Color online) (a) Number of droplets~(see text) as a function of the initial number of atoms $20$ms after a quench from $a=120 a_B$ to $70a_B$; the inset shows the \nnumber of particles per droplet as a function of $N$ under the same conditions.

In order to \nmeasure objectively the number of droplets, we have obtained the column density $n_{XY}(x,y)\\equiv\\int dz\\, n({\\mathbf r})$ after $20$ ms of post-instability dynamics, and defined a droplet as such if it reaches a maximal \n$n_{X,Y}/N>0.3$~(see e.g. Figs.~\\ref{fig:1}). Figure~\\ref{fig:3}(a) summarizes our results for the dependence with $N$ of the number of droplets formed after $20$ ms of post-instability dynamics. Although as mentioned \nabove the number of droplets presents a relevant statistical variance, the average number shows in agreement with experiments an approximate linear dependence.\nThe deviation at larger $N$ is due to the fact that at $20$ms there are a number of droplets that are about to be nucleated in the outer halo regions but are not fully formed (according to the previous criterion). \nThe deviation at low $N$ is due to the longer time needed to fully develop droplets (e.g. $N=5000$ develops up to $3$ droplets after $40$ms). \nThe approximate linear dependence of Fig.~\\ref{fig:3}(a) stems from the local character of the nucleation, which results in a number of particles per droplet that is basically \nindependent of $N$~(inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig:3}(a)). \nThe histogram of Fig.~\\ref{fig:3}(b) shows that, as expected from our discussion of the droplet energy, the particle number per droplet lies overwhelmingly between $900$ and $1500$, \nwith an average of approximately $1200$, again in good agreement with experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Three-body losses--} \nWe observe in our Dy simulations peak densities of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{21}$m$^{-3}$~\\cite{footnote-peak}. At these densities, albeit low, 3BL \nbecome relevant in the long run. In order to take them into account, we add a term $-i\\frac{\\hbar L_3}{2}|\\psi({\\mathbf r})|^4 \\psi({\\mathbf r})$~\\cite{Lahaye2008} to the right hand side of Eq.~\\eqref{eq:gNLNLSE}, with \n$L_3=1.2\\times 10^{-41}$m$^{6}/$s~\\cite{footnote-L3}. \nFigure~\\ref{fig:4} shows for $N=10000$ the number of atoms as a function of time. We show in the same figure, the spectral weight \n$SW=\\int d^2k \\tilde n_{XY}({\\mathbf k})$, where $\\tilde n_{XY}({\\mathbf k})$ is the Fourier transform of the column density $n_{XY}(x,y)\\equiv \\int dz\\, n({\\mathbf r})$ and \nthe momentum integral extends from $k_{min}=1.5\\mu$m$^{-1}$ to $k_{max}=5\\mu$m$^{-1}$. \nThis function was introduced in Ref.~\\cite{Kadau2015} to characterize the appearance and disappearance of the droplet pattern.  \nThe losses not only decrease the atom number, but also  lead to the eventual destruction of the droplets, which may loose too much particles to remain stable against \nmelting in the background. Moreover, 3BL eliminates high-energy atoms at the BEC maxima. This energy dissipation \nplays an important role in the eventual nucleation of further droplets, and especially in the formation of crystal-like droplet arrangements as those of Fig.~\\ref{fig:1}, which minimize inter-droplet interaction. \nThe results of Fig.~\\ref{fig:4} are in very good agreement with experiments, showing a growth of SW up to $t\\sim 10$ms, and a subsequent decrease in a much longer time scale, accompanied by \nthe corresponding particle loss due to 3BL.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure4.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace*{-0.2cm}\n\\caption{(Color online) Number of atoms~(blue dotted) and spectral weight~(red solid)  as a function of the time after a quench from $a=120 a_B$ to $70a_B$ for a BEC with initially $N=10000$ atoms.}\n\\label{fig:4}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Conclusions and outlook--} Quantum fluctuations prevent local collapses in unstable dipolar BECs. \nIn particular, our results show the appearance of filament-like droplets, accounting for recent results in Dy condensates.\nSince the LHY correction depends on $na^3$, we expect that droplets should collapse for lower $a$ values, providing a clear criterion to discern LHY stabilization from \nstabilization based on large three-body forces~\\cite{Xi2015,Bisset2015}. Our results, based on a simplified treatment using a generalized NLNLSE are already in very \ngood agreement with the experiments~\\cite{Kadau2015,Pfau-Private}, although a \nmore precise analysis of the effects of long-wave length excitations in small droplets may be necessary to provide a fully quantitative comparison, in particular in what concerns \nthe peak density in the droplets. We stress that LHY stabilization results from the anisotropy of the dipolar interactions. It was \nabsent in previous Cr experiments~\\cite{Lahaye2008} because the BEC became unstable for a value of $a\\simeq $ \n$10$ times smaller than in Dy ($m|{\\boldsymbol \\mu}|$ in Dy is $10$ times larger than in Cr), and LHY stabilization would demand $n\\sim 10^{24}$m$^{-3}$, a density \nwhich is never reached due to 3BL. In contrast, LHY stabilization and droplet nucleation are a characteristic general feature induced by the DDI that may play a role in all future \nexperiments with strongly dipolar gases of highly-magnetic atoms and polar molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\it Acknowledgements.--} We thank D.
