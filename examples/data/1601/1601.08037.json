They are mainly produced in the envelopes of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars \\citep{Gail2009, Molster2003} and are injected into the DISM.  \nCarbonaceous dust can then be processed (by photons, ions, cosmic rays) and can further evolve during their lifetime in these heterogeneous environments \\citep{Jones2014a}. Carbon materials can be classified according to their sizes, which range from (large) polycyclic hydrocarbon molecules to solid-state carbon grains, their aliphatic vs aromatic content, and their spectra, among other properties (e.g., \\cite{Henning1998}). In solid carbon, sp$^2$, sp$^3$, and mixed hybridizations are possible, giving rise to materials with different short-, medium-, and long-range orders \\citep{Jager1998, Papoular1996, Tielens2008}. \n\nDifferent carbon dust components in space are identified by their observed spectral signatures. In the infrared, observations of the 3.4 $\\mu$m absorption band were attributed to vibrational CH$_2$ and CH$_3$ aliphatic modes in carbonaceous materials. The counterparts of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band at 6.85 $\\mu$m and 7.25 $\\mu$m were later observed by space telescopes. The carriers of these bands were named HAC by the astrophysical community \\citep[e.g.,][]{Pendleton2002, Furton1999, Scott1997, Duley1994}. The HAC denomination for laboratory analogs has been used for a wide variety of hydrocarbon solids, even though the structure of these materials varies from amorphous to disordered carbons. \\\\\n\\indent In the following, we refer to the plasma-produced analogs as a-C:H, a term used in the physics community. Amorphous refers to the lack of order at any scale in these materials. The laboratory infrared spectra of these materials match observed spectra, particularly regarding the shape and relative strength of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band \\citep{Dartois2007}. The structure associated with the hydrogen-rich a-C:H materials is characterized by few aromatic units linked in a mainly aliphatic backbone (e.g., Fig. 5 of \\cite{Dartois2005}). \n\nSome astrophysical carbon materials subjected to UV light re-emit in the mid-infrared. Observations of these emission features, called AIB for aromatic infrared bands, appear consistently between 3 to 20 $\\mu$m and have been classified into three main classes \\citep{Peeters2002}. The intimate structures of the carriers of these different classes of AIBs are still unknown, although they are probably built on a polyaromatic skeleton spanning sizes from large molecules to small nanograins \\citep{Leger1984, Allamandola1985,  Goto2007, Sloan2007, Pino2008, Tielens2008, Joblin2011, Li2012, Carpentier2012, Yang2013}. \n\nInterstellar extinction curves, derived from observations of several lines of sight from the near-IR to the UV, provide another clue to the type of dust present in the ISM. A persistent spectral feature is the strong absorption bump at 4.6 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ (217.5 nm), discovered by \\cite{Stecher1965}, whose central position is surprisingly constant over several lines of sight, and whose origin is still debated \\citep{Fitzpatrick2005, Fitzpatrick2007}. A steep far-ultraviolet (FUV) rise also characterizes many of these curves, tracing extinction variations. The lack of correlation between the spectral properties of the UV bump and the relative strengths of the bump and the FUV rise points to different types of dust carriers \\citep{Greenberg1983, Fitzpatrick2007}. Graphite particles were initially proposed as the carrier of the UV bump by \\cite{Draine1984}. More recently, hydrogenated carbons were proposed as potential carriers \\citep{Colangeli1997, Schnaiter1998, Mennella1999, Jager2008}, supporting theoretical work by \\cite{Duley1998}.\n\nThe central goal of this study is to obtain \\textit{\\textup{absolute}} spectral properties of carbon dust analogs in both the VUV/Vis regions and the infrared ranges, complementing earlier studies of hydrocarbon solids, particularly in the VUV range, where optical measurements are scarce. A full spectral characterization of these materials will clarify their potential contributions as carriers of observed spectral features in the infrared and in the UV, such as the FUV rise and also the 217.5 nm bump of interstellar extinction curves. In addition, infrared spectra allow us to characterize the quality and suitability of our samples as interstellar analogs.  These transmission spectra allow the derivation of optical constants from these carbonaceous materials, necessary to simulate observed astronomical extinction curves. \n\nCarbon analogs have been produced in the laboratory using different methods and their spectra in transmission, reflection, or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) (see \\cite{Henning2004} for a review) has been used to extract optical constants. \n\\cite{Stecher1965} first derived optical constants of nanometer-sized graphitic particles.\n\n\\cite{Draine1984} derived the optical constants from laboratory and observational data for graphite down to 80 nm by the Kramers-Kronig approach using EELS data from \\cite{Tosatti1970}. \n \n\\cite{Zubko1996} used the same method to obtain the optical constants of several solid hydrocarbons from the millimeter to the FUV down to 40 nm.  \n\\cite{Schnaiter1996, Schnaiter1998}  derived the optical constants through UV measurements of nano-sized carbon grains using the matrix-isolation technique in the 200 - 400 nm region. \n \n\\cite{Furton1999} also obtained the optical constants of a hydrogenated carbon film by trial and error fitting in the range of 300 - 1000 nm. \nThese values have a dispersion of between $\\sim$10\\% and 20\\% at any given wavelength, and they compare closely to other published data for similar a-C:H materials, for example, \\cite{Smith1984} between 253 nm - 900 nm, and for organic residues, for example, \\cite{Jenniskens1993} from 115 nm to 1.7 $\\mu$m. \n\n\\cite{Jager1998} derived the optical constants  of carbonized cellulose samples using the Lorentz-oscillator fit method in the range of 200 - 500 nm based on reflectance measurements. This was done later for  gas-phase condensed soots from 120 nm to the mid-infrared \\citep{Jager2008}. Few laboratory based determinations of optical constants of carbon analogs exist for $\\lambda$ $<$ 120 nm.  \\cite{Fink1984} measured the EELS spectra from 300 nm to 40 nm for amorphous carbons. \\cite{Colangeli1993} measured the spectra of carbon samples down to $\\sim$50 nm through transmission\nor reflection on a gold-coated quartz window. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the experimental setups used in sample preparation and characterization of the carbonaceous materials. In Sect. 3 we present the UV and MIR spectroscopy of both materials. In Sect. 4 we describe the method used to derive the optical constants. In Sect. 5 we discuss the astrophysical implications of these measurements. Finally, in Sect. 6 we present our conclusions. \n\n\\section{Experiments}\nWe studied two types of carbonaceous dust: a-C:Hs and soot samples. The a-C:Hs were produced using an R.F. plasma reactor at low pressures. Their typical structural unit is shown in \\cite{Dartois2005}. Soot materials have been produced in an ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) flame and provide samples dominated by a polyaromatic carbon skeleton (e.g., \\cite{Carpentier2012}). While our a-C:H materials have a high H/C, our soot materials have low H/C.\n\n\nTwo types of substrates were used: MgF$_2$ windows and TEM grids (\\textit{Ted Pella, Inc.}) covered with a nm-thick metallic or carbon membrane. Samples of MgF$_2$ were used to ensure UV-visible transmission measurements down to $\\lambda$ = 120 nm. Samples deposited on the 3 mm TEM grids were used for transmission measurements from $\\lambda$ = 120 nm to 50 nm.  The grids were 300 mesh Au or Cu substrates covered with a 2-3 nm layer of gold or platinum, or 10-25 nm of carbon. Manipulation of the TEM grids was done with high-precision tweezers, but more often than not, the fragile grid supports were bent and/or the thin membrane shattered, either during installation in the sample holder or during deposition of the film. We inspected the films with a binocular microscope at the Institut d\\textsc{\\char13}Astrophysique Spatiale and with microscopic images taken at the SMIS beam line at the SOLEIL synchrotron.\n\nAs a result of four experimental campaigns in 2014 and 2015 at the DISCO VUV beam line of the SOLEIL synchrotron, we found that while Au or Pt membranes (2 - 3 nm) had good transmittance in the VUV (T $\\leq$ 30 \\%), they were very fragile during manipulation and during film deposition. Most VUV measurements on these substrates showed that the membranes were damaged either partially or completely. Instead, the carbon membranes on TEM grids (T $\\leq$ 20 \\%) proved to be more robust. \nWe discuss the effect of these substrates on the film transmission spectra in Appendix \\ref{Ap3}. \n\n\n\\subsection{Preparation of a-C:H films}\n\n\n\\textit{SICAL-ICP} is an experimental setup developed for the purpose of producing hydrogenated amorphous carbon films, see Fig.~\\ref{sical}. \nIt consists of an inductively coupled radio frequency (R.F.) generator working at 13.56 MHz (\\textit{Elite series}, MKS) with a dynamic range of 1 - 600 W. A background pressure of $<$ 0.01 mbar is maintained by a primary pump. The precursor hydrocarbon gas (CH$_4$) supply is manually controlled with a fine valve and deposits are made in continuous flow kept at $\\sim$0.1 mbar, after passivation of the chamber with the precursor.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=90mm]{Sical-schema-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n  \\captionof{figure}{\\textit{SICAL- ICP} is a setup allowing plasma-induced chemical vapor deposition. It is comprised of a glass tube in which an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) on a continuum hydrocarbon gas flow is maintained by an R.F. source. The plasma envelopes the sample holder placed near the matching box.}\n  \\label{sical}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe R.F. discharge is operated in a glass tube (length = 1 m, $\\phi_{ext}$ = 65 mm), allowing for the plasma to symmetrically envelop the sample holder. The R.F. power is inductively coupled to the plasma by means of an impedance matching network linked to a copper coil around the glass cylinder. The tuning box allows extracting a portion of the R.F. power coupled to the substrate holder acting as an externally applied bias. For most samples, the power was kept at 100 W, with 5 W reflected. \nThe sample holder consists of a gold-coated copper block capable of holding 20 mm windows. The holder can be internally cooled by water, and the substrate can be installed by removing a mechanical cover. \nThe estimated ion energies are on the order of 80 eV, thereby producing films with a hydrogen content up to 40\\% \\citep{Dworschak1990}. \nThis R.F. source allows lower ion energy densities than with the 2.45 GHz source previously used by \\cite{Dartois2005}, giving a-C:H films with higher hydrogen content due to the decreased preferential sputtering of the C-H bonds vs. the C-C bonds.  Lower pressures leading to higher ion energies also lead to sputtering of hydrogen. \nSamples are prepared at room temperature, although the substrate temperature has a strong influence on the film properties \\citep{Dworschak1990}.  \n\nTo control the deposition rate for the films, we used the correlation between the optical depth of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band and the thickness of the films (\\textit{d}) for films with \\textit{d} $>$ 100 nm, using their Fabry-Perot interference fringes that are due to internal reflections within the film itself.  We extrapolated this correlation for films with \\textit{d} $<$ 100 nm (see Appendix \\ref{Ap1} for details). As a first estimate of the refraction\nindex of these films in the optical, we used the relation in \\citep{Godardthese} between the optical gap (E$_{04}$) and the refraction index measured for different a-C:H and a-C (amorphous carbon) films (e.g., \\cite{Dischler1983, Lazar1998, Kassavetis2007}). For our a-C:H materials, we derived the Tauc band gap E$_{g}$ = 2.5 eV, or E$_{04}$ = 3.1 eV, and using the aforementioned relation, we estimate n$_0$ $\\sim$1.4 - 1.8.  \n\n\\subsection{Preparation of soot films}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=75mm]{nanograins-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n\\captionof{figure}{\\textit{Nanograins}, an experimental setup for the preparation of soots.

In the setup, whose scheme is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:2}, a flat burner (McKenna) provides flames of premixed hydrocarbon and oxygen gas. Such a laminar flame is a one-dimensional\nchemical reactor offering a broad range of combustion conditions and sampling of byproducts. Here the pressure was maintained at 40 mbar by continuous pumping. The fuel used was ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$) premixed with oxygen before flowing through the burner at a controlled flow rate (4 liters/min), and a C/O ratio set to 1.05. An N$_2$ shield around the burning region was applied at a controlled flow rate of 3 liters/min. The byproducts were then extracted by a water-cooled quartz cone (hole diameter = 1 mm) inserted into the flame at 30 mm from the burner. The burned gas and soot flow through a nozzle into a chamber at 5$\\times$10$^{-2}$ mbar. Soot particles were deposited on MgF$_2$/KBr/NaCl windows or Au/C/Pt membranes, inserted directly into the molecular flow. The thicknesses of the soot nanoparticle films varied in a range\nof a few tens of nm to 1 $\\mu$m, depending both on the production rate and the exposure time, to optimize the spectral response in the different wavelength domains from the IR to the VUV. \n\n\n\\subsection{Instruments for UV and IR spectroscopy}\nUltraviolet measurements of our carbon analogs were performed with three instruments. At the IAS we use a UV-Vis spectrometer ($\\lambda$ = 210 nm - 710 nm) with a sub-nm resolution. It consists of a deuterium lamp, whose light is conducted by optical fibers and illuminates the sample. The transmitted signal is then collected and carried by optical fibers toward a grating spectrometer (Maya PRO UV, \\textit{Ocean Optics}). For measurements in the vacuum ultraviolet, we use the APEX branch of the DISCO beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron. The APEX chamber allows  measurements at $\\lambda$ = 50 nm - 260 nm in windowless mode \\citep{Giuliani2009}, with a beam size at the sample of $\\leq$ 2 mm. From now on, we interchange between the terms VUV and FUV to refer to this  wavelength range. Finally, a spectrophotometer (Specord, \\textit{Analytikjena}) allowed measurements on MgF$_2$ windows at $\\lambda$ = 190 - 1000 nm. \n\nInfrared measurements for the thicker (\\textit{d} $>$  300 nm) films deposited on MgF$_2$ windows were made using an evacuated FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Vertex 80V) equipped with a KBr beamsplitter and an (MCT) detector working in the 7000 to 400 cm$^{-1}$ (2.5 to 15 $\\mu$m) spectral range at 1 cm$^{-1}$ resolution. \nTo measure the infrared spectra of ultra-thin films (\\textit{d} $<$ 100 nm) we used the infrared microscope available at the SMIS beam line at the SOLEIL synchrotron.  This microscope  benefits from high synchrotron brilliance in the 2.5 - 100 $\\mu$m spectral range and a 10$\\times$10 $\\mu$m spot size on the sample. \n\n\\section{Measurements} \n\\subsection{UV spectra: a-C:H and soots}\n\\label{sec:UV}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=90mm]{fig4b-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n  \\captionof{figure}{VUV measurements of ultra-thin films:  a-C:H and soot optical depth spectra normalized to $\\tau$($\\sim$10 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$).  a-C:H film,\n  \\textbf{{\\color{LimeGreen} ---}}: MgF$_2$ (Specord), \\textbf{{\\color{red} ---}}: MgF$_2$ (DISCO), \\textbf{{\\color{blue} ---}}: TEM membrane (DISCO).

We assumed that there are no optical effects due to the substrates, which we further discuss in Appendix \\ref{Ap3}.  The resulting normalized optical depth spectra for an a-C:H and a soot nanoparticle film are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig4b}.\n\nThe UV-VUV spectra reveal the electronic structure of the carbon analogs, arising from transitions between threefold (sp$^2$ bonding) and fourfold (sp$^3$) bonding coordination, and any mixture of these two bondings (sp bonding is not considered here as it is a minor component in our samples). \nThe optical gap reaches from states in the valence $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ band to states in the conduction $\\sigma^*$ and $\\pi^*$ bands. \nThe $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ bands due to sp$^2$ sites typically occur from 200 to 500 nm (2 - 5 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$) and dominate the optical gap value.  The  $\\sigma$ - $\\sigma^*$ transitions peak below 200 nm (5 - 10 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$). Both of these bands produce an absorption from the UV to the visible and infrared domain. \nThe optical gap in amorphous or disordered carbon can extend to the IR induced by defect states. It can take a value of 0 eV for graphite, along a plane, and up to 5.5 eV for diamond. \n\nAn a-C:H sample of thickness $\\geq$ 30 nm becomes optically thick in the VUV. However, these films are optically thin in the UV-Vis range, which allows us to discern weaker absorption features, such as the absorption bands at $\\sim$4 - 5 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$. The reconstructed VUV spectra of an ultra-thin a-C:H film (\\textit{d} $\\sim$20 nm ) and soot film (\\textit{d} $\\sim$50 nm) are shown in Figs. \\ref{fig:5ab} (a) and (b), respectively. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\subfloat[  ]{{\\includegraphics[width=90mm]{fig5a-eps-converted-to.pdf} }}\n    \\qquad\n    \\subfloat[  ]{{\\includegraphics[width=90mm]{fig5b-eps-converted-to.pdf} }}\n    \\caption{VUV optical depth in the VUV of \\textit{(a)} an a-C:H film and \\textit{(b)} a soot nanoparticle film (described in the text).

Two overlapping absorption peaks (G1, G2) occur at $\\sim$4 and at 5 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$. G1 is assigned to $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ transitions due to locally aromatic carbon clusters \\citep{Robertson1987}. G2 is assigned to a superposition of carbon $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ transitions and/or \\textit{n} - $\\sigma^*$ transitions from oxygen contamination as discussed in \\cite{Gadallah2011}. The third absorption (G3) peak at $\\sim$9 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ (115 nm) in the far-UV is assigned to $\\sigma$ - $\\sigma^*$ transitions. A fourth peak (G4) is found at $\\sim$16 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ (58 nm). A tentative identification of this fourth peak is given below. \n\n\\begin{table}\\centering\n\\centering\n\\captionof{table}{Best-fit parameters for VUV spectra} \\label{tab1} \n\\begin{tabular}{@{} cccc @{} }\n\\toprule\nFunction & Parameter [ $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ ] & soot & a-C:H \\\\\n\\toprule\n\\multirow{3}{*}{Lorentzian (L1) } & area   & 3.33 &   \\\\ \n & center  & 3.92 &  \\\\ \n& width & 2.01  & \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multirow{3}{*}{Gaussian (G1)} & height & & 0.06   \\\\ \n& center   &   & 3.83  \\\\ \n& width &   & 5.64 \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multirow{3}{*}{Gaussian (G2)} & height & 0.22 & 0.11   \\\\ \n& center   & 5.42  & 5.05  \\\\ \n& width & 6.37 & 6.13 \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multirow{3}{*}{Gaussian (G3)} & height & 1.14  & 0.71 \\\\ \n& center & 9.71 & 8.67  \\\\ \n& width   & 1.81  & 1.83 \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multirow{3}{*}{Gaussian (G4)} & height &  1.58 & 1.21   \\\\ \n& center   & 19.2  & 17.4  \\\\ \n& width & 4.41 & 4.55 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe soot UV absorption spectrum was fitted by a Lorentzian, three Gaussians, and a linear function (slope $\\sim$0.01 in energy units). The first peak (L1) is well-adjusted by a Lorentzian function peaking at 3.92 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ and assigned to $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ transitions. The relatively strong intensity of this feature points to a highly poly-aromatic material, close in shape but not in position to the interstellar UV bump at 4.6 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$. A weak peak (G2) at 5.4 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ is assigned to  $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ transitions from carbon and/or \\textit{n} - $\\sigma^*$ transitions from oxygen contamination. A third broad peak (G3) occurs at 10 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ (100 nm) and a fourth peak (G4) is present at about 19 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ (52 nm). The linear function helps fit the soot opacity from 1 $\\mu$m$^{-1}$  (while no linear function is required for the a-C:H fit).  \n\nThe position of peaks in the soot film are found at higher energies than for the a-C:H, with $\\Delta$(L1-G1)= 0.19 eV, $\\Delta$G2 = 0.45 eV, $\\Delta$G3 = 1.62 eV, $\\Delta$G4 =  2.47 eV. Two $\\pi$-electronic transitions are found between 200 - 260 nm in both materials. For the hydrogen-richer a-C:H, the lower sp$^2$ carbon fraction decreases the $\\pi$ density of states, which accounts for the weaker $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ band strengths. By taking the optical depth ratio of the L1 to G3 feature in the soot spectra (Fig. \\ref{fig:5ab}a) and dividing it by the optical depth ratio of the G1 to G3 feature in the a-C:H spectra (Fig. \\ref{fig:5ab}b), we find that the $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ resonance is $\\sim$10 times stronger in soot than in a-C:H. \n\nLaboratory spectra of gas phase PAHs have shown their contribution to a FUV rise from a band with an extrapolated maximum at $\\sim$17.7 eV (70 nm) \\citep{Joblin1992}. Later on, \\cite{Malloci2004}  computed the absolute photo-absorption cross sections of 20 PAHs in the VUV.  They found a good agreement both for the lower-lying bands of $\\pi$ - $\\pi^*$ character and for the collective single broad absorption peak at $\\sim$17 - 18 eV, composed of $\\sigma$ - $\\sigma^*$, $\\pi$ - $\\sigma^*$, $\\sigma$ - $\\pi^*$ and Rydberg state transitions, with possible contributions from collective effects (e.g., plasmons). \nIn graphite, in addition to the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ interband transitions, a band at 27 eV, measured in reflectance, was assigned to the collective excitations of the $\\pi$ + $\\sigma$ plasmon \\citep{Djurisic1999}. \nIn diamond-like carbon films (DLC), in addition to the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ interband transitions, a FUV contribution to absorption was detected using synchrotron ellipsometry, peaking at around 22 eV (56 nm, \\cite{Franta2011}, Fig. 5). The transitions in this range are attributed by the authors to valence $\\sigma$ to extended states transitions $\\sigma$ - $\\xi^*$. Figure 3 and Table 1 in \\cite{Franta2011} depict the density of states for the corresponding band model. \nA marked double-peak structure was predicted by theoretical studies of the frequency-dependent dielectric permittivity in the optical to VUV domain of modeled carbon soot nanoparticles \\citep{Moulin2008, Langlet2009}. The calculations predicted two peaks in the $\\sim$20 - 30 eV range. The double-peak structure was suggested to arise from the polyaromatic units with a size distribution ranging from a few angstroms up to a few nm. In light of these findings, we tentatively assign the G4 band observed in both analogs to the features observed in this energy range in other carbonaceous materials. These transitions  involve excitations from $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ states toward extended states above the $\\sigma^*$ band. The nature of these excited states is still unknown and work is in progress to explore it. \n\n\\subsection{Mid-infrared spectra: a-C:Hs and soots}\n\nWe measured the carbon analog thin films in the MIR with two objectives. The first is to correlate the integrated 3.4 $\\mu$m band to the thickness of an a-C:H film to normalize the corresponding laboratory UV spectra to interstellar extinction curves. The second objective is to assess the homogeneity of the films and compare spectra from the same spatial region where the UV spectra is measured.  To this end, spectra with the SMIS FTIR microscope were taken every 0.2 mm across the ultra-thin a-C:H films deposited on MgF$_2$ and on TEM grids to check the reproducibility of depositions.   \n\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=90mm]{fig9ab-eps-converted-to.pdf}\n  \\captionof{figure}{Raw transmission spectra of an a-C:H film and a soot nanoparticle film (shifted by +65\\% for comparison).}\\label{fig:9ab}\n\\end{center}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:9ab} shows the raw transmission mid-infrared spectra for an a-C:H and soot film. The continuum absorption is attributed to low-lying electronic transitions \\citep{Carpentier2012}, while the superimposed bands are due to vibrational modes. \nThe CH stretching bond region is seen at 2800 - 3100 cm$^{-1}$.  The bands between 1460 and 1380 cm$^{-1}$ correspond to the aliphatic CH$_n$ bending mode counterparts.  \nThe region between 1000 - 720 cm$^{-1}$ corresponds to out-of-plane aromatic CH bending modes that are non-detectable due to the low amount of sp$^2$ CH. \nCarbonyl is detected at $\\sim$1718 cm$^{-1}$, mainly due to oxygen contamination. A weak OH band is present at $\\sim$3400 - 3500 cm$^{-1}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\subfloat[  ]{{\\includegraphics[width=90mm]{fig9a1-eps-converted-to.pdf} }}\n    \\qquad\n    \\subfloat[  ]{{\\includegraphics[width=90mm]{fig9b1-eps-converted-to.pdf} }}\n    \\caption{Gaussian deconvolution of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band of an \\textit{(a)} a-C:H film and \\textit{(b)} soot film. The black lines correspond to the -CH$_3$ groups, the blue lines to the -CH$_2$ groups. The fit residual is in gray.}\n    \\label{fig:9ab1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe intensity of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band compared to the 6.2 and 8  $\\mu$m bands is much lower for soots than for the a-C:H, where aliphatic features dominate.  For the a-C:H films we produce H/C $\\sim$1, while for soots, the H/C ratio is lower ($\\sim$0.01). \nThe soot spectrum shows a 6.2 $\\mu$m band (at 1584 cm$^{-1}$), due to the C=C sp$^2$ stretching modes. The 8.2 $\\mu$m band (at 1225 cm$^{-1}$) is due to C-C (sp$^3$) stretching modes probably arising from defects, with a contribution at 1160 cm$^{-1}$ due to sp$^2$ aromatic CH bending modes. An alkyne CH stretching mode is present for soots at 3300 cm$^{-1}$ and is non-detectable for the a-C:H.  Band positions are coherent with previous laboratory soot infrared spectra \\citep{Pino2008, Carpentier2012}. \n\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:9ab1} (a) shows the deconvolution of the vibrational modes of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band for a-C:H as in \\cite{Dartois2004}.  The -CH$_2$ and -CH$_3$ groups dominate the spectrum of the band at 3.4 $\\mu$m, but the shoulder at $\\sim$3050 cm$^{-1}$ indicates the presence of olefinic and aromatic C-H bonds. \n\nThe observed interstellar 3.4 $\\mu$m band in the diffuse medium and the measured IR spectra of the produced a-C:H films agree\nwell \\citep{Dartois2005, Dartois2007, Godard2010}. \nWe used the oscillator strength of the observed modes to determine the aliphatic CH$_2$/CH$_3$ ratio of our a-C:H films \\citep{Dartois2004b, Dartois2007}. The oscillator strength for the CH$_3$ antisymmetric mode, at 3.38 $\\mu$m, A(a-CH$_3$) = 12.5 $\\times$ 10$^{-18}$ cm/group, while for CH$_2$ antisymmetric + Fermi resonance at 3.377 $\\mu$m, A(a-CH$_2$) = 8.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-18}$ cm/group \\citep{Dartois2004b, Dartois2007}. \nThe calculated N(CH$_2$)/N(CH$_3$) ratio obtained from fitting the vibrational modes of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band is 2.4 $\\pm$ 0.3, in agreement with observations toward Cyg OB2 No. 12, which samples only diffuse ISM dust \\citep{Pendleton2002},  where a ratio of 2.5 $\\pm$ 0.4 is found, and to observations toward the infrared galaxy IRAS 08572+3915 \\citep{Dartois2007}. \n\nFigure \\ref{fig:9ab1} (b) shows the deconvolution of the vibrational modes of the 3.4 $\\mu$m band for the soot nanoparticle film. From this, the calculated aliphatic N(CH$_2$)/N(CH$_3$) ratio = 7 $\\pm$ 3. Using the oscillator strength for the aromatic CH vibrational mode at 3.289 $\\mu$m, A(CH) = 1.9 $\\times$ 10$^{-18}$ cm/group \\citep{Joblin1994}, we find N(CH)$_{arom}$/N(CH$_{2,3}$)$_{ aliph}$ = 1.1 $\\pm$ 0.3, in agreement with \\cite{Carpentier2012}.  Using the band strengths from methyl-substituted PAHs \\citep{Yang2013}, we find N(CH)$_{arom}$/N(CH$_{2,3}$)$_{ aliph}$  = 0.96 $\\pm$ 0.2.\n\n\n\\section{VUV optical constants}\n\\label{sec:uvcon}\nOptical constants were extracted from the transmission spectra of a-C:H films of varying thickness.

For this, we used the model of \\cite{Swanepoel1983}, who derived the expression for the transmission of a thin absorbing film on a transparent substrate (MgF$_2$ in our case).

We derived the optical constants for a laboratory a-C:H and soot from several sets of transmission measurements at different thicknesses. We used these optical constants to calculate extinction curves that show that a-C:Hs contribute to the steep FUV rise, while soots are suitable carriers of the UV bump. Astronomical spectra of dust shortward of the Lyman limit are currently lacking, mostly due to the absorption lines of hydrogen and helium, which have large FUV and extreme-UV (EUV) effective absorption cross sections \\citep{Hawkins1991}.
