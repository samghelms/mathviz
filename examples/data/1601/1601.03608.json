The main aim of this study is to determine which set of model parameters leads to the formation of planetary systems that are similar to the compact low mass multi-planet systems that have been discovered by radial velocity surveys and the \\emph{Kepler} mission. We vary the initial disc mass, solids-to-gas ratio and the sizes of the boulders/planetesimals, and for a restricted volume of the parameter space we find that compact systems containing terrestrial planets, super-Earths and Neptune-like bodies arise as natural outcomes of the simulations. Disc models with low values of the solids-to-gas ratio can only form short-period super-Earths and Neptunes when small planetesimals/boulders provide the main source of accretion, since the mobility of these bodies is required to overcome the local isolation masses for growing embryos. The existence of short-period super-Earths around low metallicity stars provides strong evidence that small, mobile bodies (planetesimals, boulders or pebbles) played a central role in the formation of the observed planets.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\begin{keywords}\nplanetary systems, planets and satellites: formation, planets-disc interactions, protoplanetary discs.\n\\end{keywords}\n\\section{Introduction}\nBoth radial velocity \\citep{2011arXiv1109.2497M} and transit surveys have shown conclusively that systems of low mass planets are common around main sequence stars, with the \\emph{Kepler} mission in particular providing some striking examples of short period compact multi-planet systems \n\\citep{Lissauer2011, Fabrycky2014}. The most recent release of \\emph{Kepler} data contains over 4700 planet candidates, and more than 700 multi-planet systems \\citep{Mullally2015}. Approximately 3000 systems show just a single transiting planet candidate, with orbital periods in the range $0.5 \\le P \\le 500$ days.\n\nAnalysis of the systems properties provides useful insight for understanding how these planets formed and evolved. One noticeable feature of the multi-systems is the paucity of first order mean motion resonances. The period ratio distribution shows features in the vicinity of the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances, suggesting that they have been dynamically important in the past, but relatively few systems are actually in a strict mean motion resonance \\citep{Fabrycky2014}. Examples of systems of small planets that are in or very close to resonance, including 3 body resonances or resonant chains, include Kepler 50 (6:5), Kepler 60 (5:4, 4:3) \\citep{Steffen2012}, Kepler 221 (displays a 3 body resonance) \\citep{Fabrycky2014}. In general the compact multi-planet systems appear to be composed of terrestrial planets, super-Earths and Neptune-like bodies. Mass estimates based on both radial velocity and transit timing variations suggest that there is a strong diversity in the mean densities of these objects, with some being rocky, some appearing to have a mixture of rock and water, and others being of very low density indicating the presence of significant fractions of H/He \\citep{Lissauer2011, WuLithwick2013, Marcy2014, Jontof-Hutter2015}. Kepler 36 provides an example where a pair of neighbouring planets orbiting close to the 7:6 resonance have dramatically different densities, characteristic of a rocky terrestrial inner body and an outer mini-Neptune \\citep{Carter2012}. One of the most interesting facts to emerge from the data is the presence of low mass planetary systems around stars with a broad range of metallicities, including stars whose iron contents are factors of $\\sim 3$ smaller than the solar abundance \\citep{Buchhave2014}, a result that is supported by radial velocity discoveries of planets around metal-poor M dwarfs, such as Kapteyn's star \\citep{Anglada-Escude2014}.\n \nA number of ideas have been put forward to explain the formation and early evolution of the compact \\emph{Kepler} and radial velocity systems, which in cases such as Gliese 581 and HD 69830 appear to contain in excess of $\\sim 30 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ of solid material within a few tenths of an au \\citep{Lovis2006,Udry2007}. This concentration of solids close to the star led to classical core accretion models combined with disc driven migration being developed using population synthesis codes \\citep{Alibert2006}. More recent population synthesis calculations that also include prescriptions for planet-planet interactions have also been presented \\citep{IdaLin2010}. N-body simulations, combined with either hydrodynamic simulations or analytic prescriptions for migration and eccentricity/inclination damping of planetary growth, have also been used to examine the origins of such\nsystems \\citep{CresswellNelson2006, cressnels, TerquemPapaloizou2007, McNeilNelson2009, McNeilNelson2010, Hellary, Cossou, ColemanNelson14, Hands14}. A common outcome of these N-body simulations is the formation of resonant convoys of planets in the presence of convergent migration, an outcome that is not reflected in the \\emph{Kepler} systems. Various ideas have been put forward to explain why the resonances may be unstable, including tidal eccentricity damping followed by separation of the resonance for short period systems \\citep{TerquemPapaloizou2007}, stochastic migration due to local turbulence \\citep{Adams2008,ReinPapaloizou2009,Rein2012} - a process that is likely to only operate close to the star where the disc can be thermally ionised \\citep{UmebayashiNakano1988, DeschTurner2015}, resonance breaking due to overstable librations  \\citep{GoldreichSchlichting2014}, orbital repulsion due to nonlinear spiral wave damping in planet coorbital regions \\citep{BaruteauPapaloizou2013, Podlewska-Gaca2012}.  \n\nThe paucity of mean motion resonances in the \\emph{Kepler} data has led to suggestions that the compact systems formed \\emph{in situ} through giant impacts, akin to the final stages of accumulating the terrestrial planets \\citet{ChambersWetherill1998}, after the concentration of small planetesimals in the inner disc followed by their growth into planetary embryos \\citep{HansenMurray2012}. Although this model has some success in generating non resonant multiple planet systems with inclinations that are in good agreement with \\emph{Kepler} systems, there are difficulties in explaining how such large amounts of solids become concentrated in the inner disc, and the model fails to reproduce the numbers of single transiting planets detected by \\emph{Kepler} \\citep{HansenMurray2012}. An alternative \\emph{in situ} model has been proposed by \\citet{ChatterjeeTan2014} where pebbles/boulders concentrate and form a planet at the pressure maximum generated at the interface between the inner turbulent region of the disc and the dead zone, and exterior planets are spawned in succession by the disc being eroded outwards when the planets reach gap forming masses. While this model may be able to explain some systems, it is not clear that such a model can work for systems such as Kepler 444 and Kepler 186 where the planet masses are likely to be too small to form gaps, or for planetary systems in which the innermost planets orbit further from their stars than the fully active regions are expected to extend.\n\nIn this paper we present the results from a suite of N-body simulations using an updated version of the planet formation and protoplanetary disc model presented in \\citet{ColemanNelson14}, hereafter referred to as CN14. A basic assumption of the model is that the protoplanetary disc contains a population of planetary embryos distributed across a wide range of orbital radii (between 1 - 20 au), which grow through the accretion of boulders or planetesimals, and through mutual collisions, and can accrete gas from the nebula when they reach masses $\\ge 3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. We refer to this as a \\emph{distributed core accretion model}, in contrast to one where smaller numbers of embryos might form at specific disc locations such as pressure maxima through the trapping and accumulation of solids. We include the most up-to-date prescriptions for migration, self-consistent evolution of the viscous disc, and disc removal by a photoevaporative wind on multi-Myr time scales. The main updates on CN14 include placing the inner boundary of the computational domain close to the star so that we can simulate planets that migrate to regions with orbital periods down to 1 day, addition of an active turbulent region (mimicked as a simple increase in viscosity) where disc temperatures exceed 1000~K, and a magnetospheric cavity close to the star into which planets can migrate. The aim of this work is simply to examine whether or not such a comprehensive model of planet formation is able to produce planetary systems that are similar to those that have been observed, and if so under which set of conditions (disc mass, metallicity, planetesimal/boulder sizes) do these systems form. We emphasise that this is not population synthesis. No attempt is made to select initial conditions from a distribution of possibilities constrained by observations. We are not aiming to reproduce the frequency with which certain types of planetary systems arise, but instead to just examine which conditions allow \\emph{Kepler}-like compact systems to form subject to our model assumptions. We find that the simulations produce a broad range of outcomes that correlate strongly with the amount of solids present initially in the disc, and with the sizes of the boulders/planetesimals that provide the primary feedstock for planetary growth. Short-period compact multi-systems containing both resonant and non resonant planet pairs are one particular outcome of the runs, and these arise within a restricted range of the parameter space that we consider.\n\nThe paper is organised as follows.\nWe present the physical model and numerical methods in Section \\ref{sec:meth}, and our simulation results in Section \\ref{sec:results}.\nWe compare our results with observations in Section \\ref{sec:comparison}, and we draw conclusions in Section \\ref{sec:discussion}.\n\n\\section{Physical model and numerical methods}\n\\label{sec:meth}\nThe N-body simulations presented here were performed using the Mercury-6 symplectic integrator \\citep{Chambers}, \nadapted to include the disc models and physical processes described below.\nWe use an updated version of the physical model described in CN14. The main elements of this model are described below, and the implemented updates are outlined in the following subsections. The basic model consists of 52 \nprotoplanets, orbiting within a swarm of thousands of boulders or planetesimals, \nembedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disc, all orbiting around a solar mass star.\nFor each simulation we adopt a single size for the boulders or planetesimals.\nWe define objects of radius $R_{\\rm pl}=10$~m to be \\emph{boulders} and\nobjects of radius $R_{\\rm pl} \\ge 100$~m to be \\emph{planetesimals}. These various sized objects\ndiffer from each other and from \\emph{protoplanets} or \\emph{planetary embryos}\nbecause they experience gas drag forces that vary with the size.\n\n\\subsection{Recap on the CN14 model}\nThe basic model from CN14 is comprised of the following elements:\n\n\\noindent\n(i) The standard diffusion equation for a 1D viscous $\\alpha$-disc model is solved \\citep{Shak,Lynden-BellPringle1974}. \nTemperatures are calculated by balancing blackbody cooling against viscous heating and \nstellar irradiation. In the presence of a giant planet tidal torques can open a gap in the disc.\n \n\\noindent\n(ii) The final stages of disc removal occur through a photoevaporative wind.\nA standard photoevaporation model is used for most of the disc evolution \\citep{Dullemond},\nbut if a large cavity forms in the presence of a gap forming planet, direct photoevaporation of \nthe disc is switched on if the planet sits outside of the innermost radius from where the thermally-driven wind can be \nlaunched \\citep{Alexander09}, as outlined in Section 5 of CN14.\n \n\\noindent\n(iii) Planetesimals and boulders orbiting in the disc experience aerodynamic drag.\n \n\\noindent\n(iv) We use the torque formulae from \\citet{pdk10,pdk11} to simulate type I migration\ndue to Lindblad and corotation torques. Corotation torques arise from both entropy\nand vortensity gradients in the disc, and the possible saturation of these torques is \nincluded in the simulations. The influence of eccentricity and inclination on the\nmigration torques, and on eccentricity and inclination damping are included\n\\citep{Fendyke,cressnels}.\n\n\\noindent\n(v) Type II migration of planets is included via the impulse approximation of \n\\citet{LinPapaloizou86} if they reach the gap opening mass.\n\n\\noindent\n(vi) Gas envelope accretion from the surrounding disc occurs for planets\nwhose masses exceed $3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ using fits to detailed 1D models from \\citet{Movs}. \nGas accretion occurs at the local viscous supply rate for gap forming planets. Type II migration, and gas accretion rates through the gap, have been calibrated against hydrodynamic simulations as described in CN14.\n\n\\noindent\n(vii) The effective capture radius of protoplanets accreting planetesimals is enhanced\nby atmospheric drag as described in \\citet{Inaba}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Model improvements and additions}\n\\subsubsection{Active turbulent region}\nFully developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is expected to arise in regions of the disc\nwhere the temperature exceeds 1000~K \\citep{UmebayashiNakano1988, DeschTurner2015}. \nTo account for the increased turbulent stress we increase the viscous $\\alpha$ parameter \nwhen the temperature rises above 1000~K using the prescription\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha(r) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n2\\times10^{-3} & r > r_s, \\\\\n2\\times10^{-3} + 4\\times10^{-3} \\\\\n\\times\\left(\\tanh\\left(\\dfrac{3(r_s-r-5H(r))}{5H(r)}\\right)+1\\right) & r \\le r_s, \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\alpha(r)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}[]{ll}2\\times 10^{-3}&amp;r&gt;r_{s},\\\\&#10;2\\times 10^{-3}+4\\times 10^{-3}\\\\&#10;\\times\\left(\\tanh\\left(\\dfrac{3(r_{s}-r-5H(r))}{5H(r)}\\right)+1\\right)&amp;r\\leq r%&#10;_{s},\\\\&#10;\\end{array}\\right.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd/></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mi/><mo>\u00d7</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>tanh</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2264</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable><mi/></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03608.tex", "nexttext": "\nThis scheme allows for the continuation of core growth after a gaseous envelope has been acquired, \nwhile allowing the rate of envelope accretion to adapt to the varying core and envelope mass.\nFigure \\ref{fig:newgrowth} shows gas accretion onto 3, 10 and 30 ${\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ cores without the influence of \nmigration or core growth.\nThese are similar to the models in \\citet{Hellary} and CN14, but are in better agreement with \nthe models presented by \\citet{Movs}.\nIdeally, we would incorporate self-consistent models of gas envelope accretion in\nthe simulations, but unfortunately this is too expensive computationally to run within our current model.\nWhile our fits to the \\citet{Movs} models allows gas accretion to occur at the rates prescribed in that work, \nthese fits do not change according to the local conditions in the disc, or to a time varying planetesimal \naccretion rate.

This is\nunavoidable for systems in which large scale migration leads to the formation of short period planets, with longer period planets remaining at larger semimajor axes, \nsince the time steps become prohibitively short for Gyr-run times to be achieved. For this reason, most of\nour discussion will focus on the short period systems that arise in the simulations as these are dynamically much\nmore mature than the longer period planets.\n\nThe runs were all initiated with 52 planetary embryos, of mass $0.1{\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$, separated by 10 mutual Hill radii, and with \nsemimajor axes between 1 and 20 ${\\, {\\rm au}}$. These were embedded in a swarm of thousands of planetesimals/boulders, that were \ndistributed with semimajor axes between 0.5 and 20 ${\\, {\\rm au}}$, and with masses either 10, 20 or 50 times smaller than the embryos, depending on the metallicity of the system. (This varying mass ratio between embryos and planetesimals was implemented to keep the numbers of planetesimals at a number that allowed the simulations to run on reasonable times scales. Between 3000 and 8000 planetesimals/boulders were used and run times for the individual simulations varied between 3 and 9 months.)\nThe \\textbf{effective} physical radii of planetesimals were set to either 10~m, 100~m, 1~km and 10~km, such that the primary feedstock of the accreting protoplanets ranged from being boulders to being large planetesimals whose evolution differed principally because of the strengths of the gas drag forces that they experienced.\n\\textbf{Planetesimals/boulders in our simulations represent a larger group of particles, with realistic masses depending on their physical radii, whose averaged orbits allow them to be approximated as a single massive super-particle with an effective physical radius.}\nEccentricities and inclinations for protoplanets and planetesimals/boulders were randomized according to a Rayleigh distribution, with scale parameters $e_0=0.01$ and $i_0=0.25^{\\circ}$, respectively.\n\nCollisions between protoplanets and other protoplanets or planetesimals resulted in perfect sticking.\nWe neglect planetesimal-planetesimal interactions and collisions in our simulations for reasons of computational speed.\n\nThe gas disc masses simulated were 1, 1.5 and 2 times the mass of the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN) \\citep{Hayashi}. We also vary the disc metallicity so that the initial solids-to-gas mass ratios are equal to 0.5, 1 and 2 times the solar value for the different models.\nWe smoothly increase the mass of solids exterior to the snow line by a factor of 4, as described in \\citet{Hellary}.\nWe track the changes in planetary compositions throughout the simulations, as planets can accrete material originating either interior or exterior to the snow line.\n\nCombining the three different gas disc masses, the three values of metallicity/solids-to-gas mass ratio, and the four different planetesimal/boulder sizes gives a total of 36 parameter variations.\nWe ran two instances of each parameter set, where only the random number seed to generate initial particle positions \nand velocities was changed, giving a total of 72 simulations. The full set of run parameters are detailed in Table \\ref{tab:simparam}.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\nIn order to provide context for our N-body simulations, we begin discussion of the \nresults by describing the general evolution of the disc models, and the orbital evolution \nof the protoplanets and planetesimals. We then recap the main results obtained in CN14\nbefore describing the results of the new simulations. We divide the results of the new\nruns into three distinct categories: \\emph{limited planetary growth (LPG)}; \n\\emph{moderate growth and migration (MGM)}; \\emph{giant formation and significant migration (GFSM)}.\nFor each category, we present the details of one or two representative runs, with\nTable \\ref{tab:simparam} listing the category for each run. Runs that displayed \n\\emph{limited planetary growth} resulted in no planet masses growing above $3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ during the gas disc life time (and hence the amount of type I migration was also modest), although further growth beyond $3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ could occur after dispersal of the gas disc.\nRuns showing \\emph{moderate growth and migration} formed planets in the mass range\n$3 < m_{\\rm p} < 35 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ during the gas disc life time. Simulations categorised as\n\\emph{giant formation and significant migration} formed planets with masses $\\ge 35 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$\nduring the gas disc life time, and generally displayed multiple bursts of planetary accretion\naccompanied by large scale migration that ended up with one or more planets migrating \ninto the central star. The planets that are formed in the simulations have different \ncompositions in terms of rocky, icy and gaseous material. We use a classification system \nfor the planets based on their compositions, and these are defined in Table~\\ref{tab:plcompo}.\n\n\\subsection{Typical behaviour}\n\\subsubsection{Disc evolution with an active inner turbulent region}\nFigure \\ref{fig:multiplot} shows the evolution of a  $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc model. Disc surface density profiles are shown in the left panel, temperature profiles \nare shown in the middle panel, and $H/r$ profiles are shown in the right panel. The times corresponding to each profile are indicated in the middle panel, expressed as a percentage of the disc lifetime. For a  $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc this is equal to 4.6 Myr. For a $1.5 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc the life time is 5.5 Myr, and a  $2 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc disperses completely after 6.5 Myr. The inclusion of\na turbulent inner region where $T>1000$~K causes a dip in surface density due to \nthe higher viscosity there, and it can be seen that as time progresses the location\nof the transition to the turbulent region moves in towards the star because the\nreduction in surface density reduces the viscous heating rate and the opacity.\nThe turbulent region disappears when the disc temperature no longer exceeds 1000~K\nanywhere in the disc, as shown by the yellow line in Figure \\ref{fig:multiplot}.\nThis happens in all of our disc models when the disc mass falls to approximately\n10\\% of the MMSN, which occurs 0.5 Myr before complete dispersal of the gas disc.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig2a.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig2b.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig2c.png}\n\\caption{Gas surface densities, temperatures and aspect ratios for 5, 20, 40, 60, 80, 95\\% (top-bottom lines)\nof the disc life time in a $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc (life time: 4.6 Myr)}\n\\label{fig:multiplot}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe drop in local surface density caused by the active turbulent region creates \na planet trap for low-mass planets \\citep{Masset2006}. \nThe trap moves in with the active region until it reaches the inner disc edge \nlocated at $0.05 {\\, {\\rm au}}$\n(assumed in our model to be outer edge of the magnetospheric cavity). \n\\textbf{Once at the disc inner edge, the trap created from the active turbulent region disappears due to the temperature in the disc falling below 1000~K. However the outer edge of the magnetospheric cavity acts as a planet trap for low-mass planets, until they can open a gap in the disc and undergo type II migration into the cavity as discussed in Section \\ref{sec:magnetospheric_cavity}.}\nIt should be noted that the reduction of the temperature below 1000~K at all disc locations arises\nbecause of our adoption of a 1D disc model which neglects irradiation heating of the disc along radial lines of sight, as discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:discussion}. \n\nOn longer time scales the removal of gas by the photoevaporative wind causes the disc to disperse. The loss of mass at large radius results in the inner disc emptying viscously onto the star, followed by removal of the remnant outer disc by the wind\n\\citep{Clarke2001}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{fig3.png}\n\\caption{Contour plots showing regions of inwards (red) and outwards (blue) migration) in a $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc at t = 0.1 Myr (top left), t = 1 Myr (top right), t = 2 Myr (bottom left) and t = 3 Myr (bottom right).}\n\\label{fig:contours}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsubsection{Protoplanet migration}\n\\label{sec:common_migration}\nType I migration of planets is controlled by both Lindblad and corotation\ntorques. In our disc models Lindblad torques are negative and corotation\ntorques are generally positive. Strong, positive corotation torques arise in regions where the \nradial entropy gradient is negative, and this is usually the case in the \ninner disc regions where viscous heating dominates over stellar irradiation. \nCorotation torques may saturate when either the viscous or thermal time scale \ndiffers significantly from the periods of horseshoe orbits executed by gas in\nthe corotation region. \nFigure~\\ref{fig:contours} shows contours that illustrate the migration behaviour \nof planets as a function of their masses and semimajor axes in a $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$\ndisc with solar metallicity where half of the solid material is assumed to\nbe in large bodies that do not provide any opacity. Dark blue regions\ncorrespond to strong outward migration, red regions correspond to strong\ninward migration, and white contours represent regions of parameter\nspace where the corotation and Lindblad torques balance each other. \nWe refer to these as \\emph{zero-migration zones}. The planet trap created\nby the inner turbulent region is shown by the innermost blue contour\nin the first three panels in Figure~\\ref{fig:contours}. Planets in blue\nregions migrate outwards until they come to white regions where they stop\nmigrating. These can and do act as planet convergence zones. Planets in red regions\nmigrate inwards, and if their masses are in the appropriate range they stop\nwhen they arrive at zero-migration zones. Over time we see that the migration\ncontours evolve as the disc surface density and thermal time scale decrease,\nand planets sitting in zero-migration zones slowly drift in towards the star on \nthe disc evolution time scale. A planet that grows in mass so that it exceeds \n$\\sim 10 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ will be too massive to sit in a zero-migration zone in the main \nbody of the disc, and will migrate inwards rapidly before being trapped at the \ntransition to the inner turbulent region. As this disappears the planet will drift \ninto the magnetospheric cavity interior to $0.05 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ where it will stop if it is\nbelow the local gap forming mass. If it exceeds the gap forming mass then it will\nmigrate to the 2:1 resonance location with the cavity outer edge before halting its \nmigration. If another planet enters the cavity then it may push the previous one\nthrough the inner boundary of the computational domain interior to $0.02 {\\, {\\rm au}}$.\nThe decrease in $H/r$ values in the inner disc regions (and with time) means that\nit becomes possible for quite low mass planets to open gaps in the disc and\nenter type II migration. Similarly, planets that accrete significant\ngas envelopes can become giant planets and open gaps. The transition to gap\nformation and type II migration is shown by the boundary between the red and white \ncontours in the top regions of the panels in Figure~\\ref{fig:contours}.\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{fig4a.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{fig4b.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{fig4c.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{fig4d.png}\n\\caption{Semimajor axis evolution for planets with different masses in 1, 3 and $5 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ discs: $1 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ (top left), $3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ (top right), $5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ (bottom left) and $10 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ (bottom right).

In each panel we plot the migration tracks of planets that have initial semimajor axes 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 ${\\, {\\rm au}}$.\nNote that we only consider disc masses in the range 1 - 2 $\\times$ MMSN in the full \nN-body simulations described below, but we include larger disc masses in this discussion \nto illustrate how migration changes in significantly heavier discs. Looking at the $1 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$\nmigration trajectories it is clear that planets starting with $a_{\\rm p} \\ge 1 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ \nin a $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc cannot migrate interior to $0.7 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ because of the corotation\ntorques. Even in heavier discs $1 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ planets cannot migrate very close to the star and\nbecome stranded outside the magnetospheric cavity at $\\sim 0.07 {\\, {\\rm au}}$. The implications of\nthis are clear. The origin of compact, short-period low mass planet systems such as Kepler\n444 \\citep{Campante2015} or Kepler 42 \\citep{Muirhead2012} cannot be explained by formation \nat significantly larger radii than where they are observed today, followed by large scale\ninward migration. An \\emph{in situ} formation model, perhaps aided by the \ninward drift of solids in the form of pebbles, boulders or small planetesimals would seem to be \nmore plausible. More generally, \\emph{in situ} models of planet building cannot rely on the\ndelivery of large numbers of low mass protoplanets to inner disc regions through type I\nmigration because they are not able to migrate across the required distances during gas disc life \ntimes. Looking at the $3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ migration trajectories, we see that these planets are also\nunable to reach the inner magnetospheric cavity unless orbiting in heavier discs.\nGuaranteed arrival of planets to the very innermost regions of the disc only occurs\nwhen planet masses reach $m_{\\rm p} \\ge 5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. Periods of rapid migration observed\nin the lower left and right panels of Figure \\ref{fig:planetevolution} arise when\nthe planets saturate their corotation torques. Slow drift arises when the planets\nare sitting in zero-migration zones.\n\n\\subsubsection{Planetesimal orbital evolution}\nAerodynamic drag causes planetesimal eccentricities and inclinations to be damped\nand their semimajor axes to decrease. The 10~m boulders in our simulations experience \nrapid migration such that a body located initially at $1 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ migrates to the \ninner turbulent region of the disc within aproximately $10^3$ years, and a 10~m boulder located\nat $20 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ reaches there in just over $10^6$ years. A 100~m body located\ninitially at $1 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ reaches the inner turbulent region within $\\sim 0.5$ Myr, \nand one located initially at $10 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ will reach $\\sim 6 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ within the disc life time. The larger 1~km and 10~km\nbodies show very little drag-induced migration during disc life times.\n\nThe levels of planetesimal/boulder eccentricity excitation due to gravitational stirring \nby protoplanets at the beginning of the simulations depends strongly on their sizes. \nWe find that the mean eccentricity for the 10~m bodies is $e_{\\rm pl} \\sim 3$ - \n5 $\\times 10^{-4}$, for the 100~m bodies $e_{\\rm pl} \\sim 3$ - 4 $\\times 10^{-3}$, \nfor the 1~km bodies $e_{\\rm pl} \\sim 10^{-2}$ and for the 10~km planetesimals \n$e_{\\rm pl} \\sim 2$ - 3 $\\times 10^{-2}$.\nGiven the importance of gravitational focussing in determining planetary growth rates, it is clear\nthat we should expect smaller boulders/planetesimals to accrete much more efficiently onto the \nprotoplanets. The mobility of the boulders also means that planetary embryos can grow beyond their\nnominal isolation masses on short time scales before they start to undergo significant type I migration. For protoplanets whose masses are too small for type I migration,\nit is the mobility of boulders and small planetesimals in our models that enables growth \nto occur above the isolation mass.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig5.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of masses, semi-major axes and eccentricities of all protoplanets \nin simulation K10.50.01B.}\n\\label{fig:K10.50.01Bmulti}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Recap on results from CN14}\nThe simulations presented in CN14 adopted an inner boundary to the computational\ndomain at an orbital period of 20 days, and so those calculations were unable to \nexplore the formation of short period compact planetary systems. Disc masses between \n$1 \\times$ and $5 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ were considered, with metallicities of $1 \\times$ and  $2 \\times$ solar.\nPlanetesimal sizes were 1~km and 10~km. Unlike in the present runs, no reduction in \nopacity was imposed to account for the growth of submicron dust grains into \nplanetesimals/boulders and planetary embryos that populate the disc at the beginning\nof the simulations. Instead, the inconsistent initial condition that all disc solids \nwere in the form of planetesimals and protoplanets, but with no diminution of the opacity, \nwas adopted. The disc model with $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ and solar metallity in CN14 is \ntherefore equivalent to the model with $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ and $2 \\times$ solar metallicity \nin this paper. The main results of CN14 can be summarised as:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item For discs with a low to moderate abundance of solids, only limited growth of\nplanets was observed before gas disc dispersal, although growth of planets to masses\n$m_{\\rm p} \\sim 6 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ was observed due to continued mutual collisions after the disc\nwas gone. As a consequence, only modest migration was observed in these runs, such that\nessentially no material was lost through the inner boundary.\n\\item It was commonly observed that numerous super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets\nformed in discs with intermediate masses. The bodies frequently migrated out of the disc\nthrough the inner boundary, such that in some runs no planets were left in the system at all.\nIn others, a few super-Earth and Neptune-mass planets were able to survive.\n\\item The highest disc masses considered usually led to multiple bursts of planets forming.\nGas giants with masses $m_{\\rm p} > 35 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ formed frequently. In all cases, these planets \nmigrated rapidly through the disc via type I and II migration and out through the inner boundary.\nIn some runs the final burst of planet formation and migration led to the formation of\na short-period compact system of super-Earths and Neptunes that was able to survive.\nThe highest mass planet to survive in all runs was a $13 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ gas-rich Neptune.\n\\item CN14 determined the conditions under which giant planets could form and avoid migration\ninto the star in their model of planet formation. They showed that the disc mass and orbital \nradius at which a core starts to undergo runaway gas accretion and type II migration need to be \n$\\sim 0.6$ $\\times$ MMSN and $a_{\\rm p} \\gtrsim 8 {\\, {\\rm au}}$, respectively. These same conditions \nalso apply to the models that we present in this paper, except that our adoption of a\nmagnetospheric cavity prevents an individual planet migrating all the way out of the computational\ndomain interior to $0.02 {\\, {\\rm au}}$. It is extremely difficult in our disc model for a giant planet\ncore to form and undergo runaway gas accretion at orbital radii $> 8 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ because the\nzero-migration zones shown by the contours in Figure~\\ref{fig:contours} migrate in too quickly\nto favour such an outcome. We note that increasing the disc viscosity and changing\nassumptions about the opacity model can favour the trapping of higher mass\nplanets in zero-migration zones at larger orbital radii early during disc life times, but these zero-migration zones drift downwards and inwards more rapidly in\nthe mass-period plane (as plotted in Figure~\\ref{fig:contours}) in these models because \nof the faster disc evolution \\citep[e.g.][]{Bitsch}. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig6.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of masses, semi-major axes and eccentricities of all protoplanets \nin simulation K2210B.}\n\\label{fig:K2210Bmulti}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Limited Planetary Growth (LPG)}\n\\label{sec:limited_growth}\nThe mass growth of planets is expected to be slow when either the \nabundance of solids in the disc is small, and/or when the main feedstock for planet\nbuilding is in the form of large planetesimals whose velocity dispersion is damped weakly by the gas disc. Consequently, in the limit of slow growth, no gas accreting \ncores with masses $m_{\\rm p} \\ge 3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ will be able to form before dispersal of the gas \ndisc\\footnote{We note that planetary atmospheres may form {\\it via} outgassing, but \nthis effects goes beyond the range of physical processes considered in our models. \nFurthermore, H/He rich envelopes can settle onto relatively low mass planets \n\\citep{Lammer}, and although we consider the effect of this on planetesimal accretion, \nwe do not report gas envelope masses for planets with $m_{\\rm p} < 3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ in this paper.}, \nand planet migration will be modest.\nThis outcome was obtained for all but one disc model that we considered with planetesimal \nsizes being either 1 or 10~km (the exception being the heaviest disc with mass 2 $\\times$ MMSN, $2 \\times$ solar metallicity and 1~km planetesimals). At the other end of the boulder/planetesimal size scale when 10~m boulders were included in the runs, this outcome was obtained only for the disc model with the lowest mass and metallicity.\nOverall, these results are in agreement with the low solid abundance models presented in CN14.\n\nThe simulations labelled as LPG in Table \\ref{tab:simparam} all displayed this mode of behaviour, \nand below we describe in detail the results of runs K10.50.01B and K2210B as they have\nvery different disc properties, but result in similar outcomes.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig7.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of masses, semi-major axes and eccentricities of all protoplanets \nin simulation K120.1B.}\n\\label{fig:K120.1Bmulti}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Run K10.50.01B}\nRun K10.50.01B had a disc mass of $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$, $0.5 \\times$ solar metallicity, \nand boulder radii $R_{\\rm pl}=10$~m. The combined mass in protoplanets and \nboulders was equal to $11 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$, distributed between $0.5 \\le r \\le 20 {\\, {\\rm au}}$, with \nthe mass in protoplanets being initially $5.2 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ (52 protoplanets each of\nmass $0.1 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$).\n\nThe evolution of the protoplanet masses, semimajor axes and eccentricities are shown in \nFigure~\\ref{fig:K10.50.01Bmulti} (note that boulders/planetesimals are not represented in this\nand similar plots).\nAccretion of boulders by embryos, and mutual collisions, led to the \ngrowth of protoplanets to masses in the range $0.6 \\le m_{\\rm p} \\le 0.8 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ during\nthe first 1~Myr. These embryos migrated towards the zero-migration zone located at \n$\\sim 3 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ and drifted in towards the star on the disc evolution time. Embryos located \nbeyond $10 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ grew more slowly, and remained near their initial locations throughout the \nsimulation. We note that a couple of embryos at the inner edge of the solids disc experienced \na short lived burst of migration by being shepherded inwards by a swarm of migrating boulders \nat the beginning of the simulation.\n\nDespite the convergence of planets in the zero-migration zone, the frequency of collisions \nwas limited by bodies entering mean motion resonances. Boulder collisions with embryos were scarce after 1~Myr, due to the drag-induced migration of boulders into the inner disc occurring on this time scale. With the maximum mass of a planetary embryo in the system \nbeing $0.8 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ throughout the life time of the gas disc, migration remained limited to a slow inwards drift. No planets accreted gaseous envelopes.\n\nThe disc photoevaporated after 4.6~Myr, allowing embryo eccentricities to grow \ndramatically through mutual encounters because gas disc damping had been removed.\nCollisions among the inner group of protoplanets led eventually to the formation\nof a system of four inner bodies with masses in the range $1.1 \\le m_{\\rm p} \\le 3.4 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$\nafter 10~Myr when the simulation ended. These bodies all accreted significant amounts of \nmaterial from beyond the snowline, and we class them as either water-rich terrestrials \nor water-rich super-Earths, orbiting with periods $60 \\le  P \\le 700$ days.\nThere were a significant number of protoplanets orbiting exterior to $5 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ still undergoing \ncollisional evolution at 10~Myr when the simulation ended, and these would have continued accreting if the run had been extended.\n\n\\subsubsection{Run K2210B}\nWe turn now to run K2210B, for which the disc mass was $2\\times {\\rm MMSN}$, the metallicity was \n$2\\times {\\rm solar}$, planetesimal radii were 10~km, and the disc life time was 6.6~Myr.\nThe initial mass in embryos and planetesimals was $87 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$, this being the most solids-rich disc considered in \nthis paper. In spite of this, planetary growth was very limited because of the weakly-damped \nplanetesimals.\n\nThe evolution of protoplanet masses, semimajor axes and eccentricities are \nshown in Figure~\\ref{fig:K2210Bmulti}.\nProtoplanets grew to masses $0.7 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ after 1 Myr, and when the disc dispersed\nthe maximum embryo mass was approximately $2.5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$, there having been a couple of planets that accreted rapidly just prior to the final remnants of the gas being removed. Migration was limited, with the\ninnermost body orbiting at $0.4 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ at the point of gas disc dispersal.\nAfter removal of the gas the system entered a stage of chaotic evolution, with on-going\ncollisions occurring within the embryo swarm when the run ended at 10~Myr. Approximately\n20 planets remained at this stage, the most massive being $m_{\\rm p} = 5.3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$.\nNo planets accreted gaseous envelopes.\n\n\\subsection{Moderate growth and migration (MGM)}\n\\label{sec:moderate}\nTable~\\ref{tab:simparam} shows that a total of 16 out of 72 simulations exhibited \\emph{moderate growth and migration}. MGM runs are characterised by the formation of planets with masses $3 \\le m_{\\rm p} < 35 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ before the end of the gas disc life time, with little or no loss of planets through the inner boundary of the computational domain. These simulations can result in two distinct planetary system architectures. One in which a dominant Neptune-mass body forms and migrates all the way into the magnetospheric cavity, and another where growth and migration of planets is more moderate, resulting in super-Earths and Neptunes orbiting at greater distances from the central star. Giants do not form because the growth of planets is slow enough that gas envelope accretion starts late during the disc life time, such that only moderate envelope masses have time to accrete. We discuss one representative\nexample of an MGM run that led to the formation of a compact system of super-Earths and Neptunes on short period orbits, but no planet orbiting within the magnetospheric cavity.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{fig8.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of masses, semi-major axes and eccentricities of all protoplanets \nin simulation K1.520.1A.}\n\\label{fig:K1.520.1Amulti}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Run K120.1B}\nRun K120.1B had a disc mass of $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$, $2 \\times$ solar metallicity,\nand 100~m planetesimals. The total amount of mass in embryos and planetesimals was $43.5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$.\n\nThe evolution of embryo masses, semimajor axes, and eccentricities are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:K120.1Bmulti}.\nSeveral planets grew to masses $m_{\\rm p} \\sim 2 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ during\nthe first 0.5~Myr. A common phenomenon during the simulations involving 10~m boulders or 100~m planetesimals was the formation of shepherded rings of boulders/planetesimals while the gas disc was present, and from time to time rapid growth of a planet was observed if it crossed one of these rings through\nembryo-embryo scattering. At 2~Myr an embryo of mass $0.43 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ located at $5.8 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ grew to $3.8 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ by accreting planetesimals from a shepherded ring, and hence started to accrete a gas envelope. The increase in mass eventually caused the corotation torques to saturate and the planet migrated in towards the star\nbefore forming a gap and transitioning to slower type II migration\nat $\\sim 4$~Myr. Figure~\\ref{fig:K120.1Bmulti} shows that the inward migration of this planet created an inward-migrating resonant convoy, with collisions between embryos and with planetesimals leading to embryos growing within the convoy. Initially consisting of 12 protoplanets, the arrival of\nthe convoy to the inner disc was followed by dynamical instability and collisions that left 4 short period planets remaining at the end of the simulation. These consisted of (moving out from the star) a $2.9 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ rocky terrestrial planet, an $11.6 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ gas-poor Neptune, a $7.2 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ mini-Neptune, and a $21.4 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ gas-rich Neptune, with orbital periods of 4.7, 8.3, 12.4 and 19.5 days, respectively.\nAs all of the orbital periods are less than 100 days, this inner group constitutes a compact system, within which\nonly one resonant pair exists, that being a 3:2 resonance between the gas-poor Neptune, and its neighbouring mini-Neptune.\nOther resonances existed in this group of planets and their progenitors, but were broken when strong interactions and collisions occurred. This run provides a clear example of how a short-period compact system can form through concurrent growth and migration of planets.\n\nIn the outer disc regions beyond $2 {\\, {\\rm au}}$, the dispersal of the gas disc after 4.6 Myr led to dynamical excitation of the embryos orbiting there. Planetesimals rings that had been shephered by the planets were disrupted, and a number of planets grew in mass by accreting these planetesimals. At the end of the simulation the outer region was still undergoing active accretion, and would have led  eventually to the formation of long period water-rich terrestrial and super-Earth planets orbiting between $1.85 \\le r_{\\rm p} \\le 15.2 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ if the run had been continued.\n\n\\subsection{Giant formation and significant migration (GFSM)}\n\\label{sec:colossal}\nTable~\\ref{tab:simparam} shows that only simulations with either 10~m boulders or 100~m planetesimals formed giant planets with masses $m_{\\rm p} > 35 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. Out of 72 runs, 14 resulted in the formation of giants.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig9a.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig9b.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig9c.png}\n\\caption{Final masses versus orbital period for all planets formed in all simulations displaying \\emph{limited planetary growth} (left panel), \\emph{moderate growth and \nmigration} (middle panel) and \\emph{giant formation and significant migration} (right panel). \nNote that the runs are colour coded according to the \nplanetesimal/boulder size adopted, as indicated in the legend \nin each panel.}\n\\label{fig:MVP-individual-runs}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nGas giant planet formation ensues because a core with \n$m_{\\rm p} > 3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ forms early enough that a substantial gas envelope can \naccrete either before the disc disperses or before the planet migrates into the inner magnetospheric cavity. In agreement with the results of CN14, we find that discs capable of forming giant planets undergo multiple bursts of planet formation and migration, with the first generation of giants being lost through the inner boundary. Unlike CN14, however, our model allows for the survival of migrating giants because they can become stranded within the magnetospheric cavity. Indeed, \nwe formed a total of 5 surviving giants in the simulations, the most massive of \nwhich had $m_{\\rm p} = 70 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. The most massive planet formed in any simulation\nhad $m_{\\rm p} =160 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ (in model K220.01A), but was lost through the inner boundary because a second generation of planets arrived in the magnetospheric cavity and pushed it through the inner boundary interior to $0.02 {\\, {\\rm au}}$. We discuss one run below that formed giant planets that\nexperienced significant migration.\n\n\\subsubsection{Run K1.520.1A}\nSimulation K1.520.1A had an initial disc mass of $1.5 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$, a solid abundance equal to 2 $\\times$ solar and planetesimal radii 100~m. The mass in embryos and planetesimals was $65 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$.\n\nThe evolution of protoplanet semimajor axes, masses and eccentricities are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:K1.520.1Amulti}.\nTwo planets grew above $3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ and started accreting gas envelopes within the \nfirst Myr. The saturation of corotation torques for the most rapidly growing\nprotoplanet caused it to migrate inwards, creating a resonant convoy of \nco-migrating interior embryos, one of which also accreted gas. The largest mass \nbody that drove the migration of the chain reached $m_{\\rm p} = 40 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ \n(with an envelope fraction of 87\\%) before the convoy entered the magnetospheric\ncavity. Gap formation prevented the $40 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ planet from halting at the\ntransition to the turbulent inner disc. The interior members of the group were pushed through the inner cavity and out of the computational domain, and the outermost planet stopped accreting gas and parked at the location of the \n2:1 orbital commensurability with the outer edge of the cavity.\n\nShortly after 1 Myr another pair of planets exceeded $3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$,\naccreted gas envelopes and started to migrate rapidly\nwhen their corotation torques saturated, driving another resonant\nconvoy inwards. These planets halted when they arrived at the transition to the active turbulent region at approximately 3.4~Myr. The outer planet in the convoy grew to $24 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$, formed a gap and underwent type II migration into the magnetospheric cavity, pushing the resonant convoy and the earlier formed $40 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ giant\nplanet ahead of it. All the interior planets apart from an\nadjacent $10.5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ (formed by a collision within the cavity) were pushed through the inner boundary, leaving the $24 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ and $10.5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ gas-rich Neptunes orbiting at 0.035 and $0.021 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ at the end of the simulation, with gas envelope fractions of 77\\% and 32\\%, respectively.\n\nIn the interval between 2 and 4 Myr a group of $\\sim$ Earth-mass protoplanets\ndrifted in towards the star while sitting in a zero-migration zone, and halted their migration when the gas disc dispersed.\nSubsequent collisions resulted in the formation of two water-rich super-Earths, a mini-Neptune and a water-rich terrestrial planet orbiting between $0.09 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ \nand $0.24 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ with masses in the range\n$2.3 \\le m_{\\rm p} \\le 8 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. At large radii (2 and $3 {\\, {\\rm au}}$, respectively) two water-rich terrestial planets are formed by the accretion of plantesimals after gas disc dispersal, reaching masses $\\sim 2.5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ at the end of the simulation at 10 Myr.\n\n\\subsection{Summary of LPG, MGM and GFSM results}\nWe now summarise the results obtained in the simulations\naccording to which class of outcome they fall into.\n\n\\subsubsection{LPG}\nSimulations classified as showing \n\\emph{limited planetary growth} led to similar outcomes\ndespite diverse initial conditions: \n(i) discs with low solids abundances containing boulders and small planetesimals; (ii) discs with relatively high abundances of solids in the form of large planetesimals.\nThe final outcomes of these simulations are summarised \nin the mass versus period diagram shown in the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:MVP-individual-runs}. We see that no very\nshort period planets were formed, and final masses are all\nbelow $10 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. The inverse correlation between mass and\nsemimajor axis arises because of modest disc driven\nmigration that caused the most massive bodies to drift in.\nThe colour coding of the symbols shows that the final \noutcomes are similar for all boulder and planetesimal \nsizes. \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig10a.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig10b.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig10c.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of planet mass versus orbital period\nfor disc with mass 1 $\\times$ MMSN and metallicity 2 $\\times$\nsolar.

Right panel: 10~km planetesimals.}\n\\label{fig:MVP-tracks-planetesimal-size}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{MGM}\nThe final states of all runs that exhibited \n\\emph{moderate growth and migration} are shown in the middle panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:MVP-individual-runs}. Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets on short period orbits are formed,\nand these occur almost always in compact systems (see the lower panels in Figure~\\ref{fig:allplanets} in the appendix which shows the final outcomes of all individual runs that were classified as MGM). We note a strong inverse correlation between mass and orbital period in Figure~\\ref{fig:MVP-individual-runs} caused by migration.\nLow mass planets on short period orbits were shepherded in\nas members of resonant convoys driven by more massive planets.\nWithin individual systems this often led to a direct\ncorrelation between mass and orbital period because migration\nwas driven by more massive bodies at the outer edge of migrating\nresonant chains.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:MVP-individual-runs} shows that the most\nmassive survivors have migrated into the magnetospheric cavity.\nTheir migration was rapid enough to send them in this far,\nand they are often accompanied by short-period planets that are surviving members of a resonant convoy that avoided being pushed through the inner boundary.\nAs mentioned briefly above, runs classified as MGM can be divided into two sub-classes: those that produce objects that migrate quickly enough to reach the magnetospheric cavity, and those which do not, with faster planet growth in more solids-rich discs and/or containing smaller planetesimals/boulders leading to the first sub-class. \n\n\\subsubsection{GFSM}\nThe final outcomes of runs classified as showing \\emph{giant formation and significant migration} are presented in the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:MVP-individual-runs}. It is clear that all of the surviving gas giant planets have migrated into the magnetospheric cavity, and some of them are accompanied by interior lower mass planetary companions.  \n\nOnly models with 10~m boulders and 100~m planetesimals formed giant planets with masses $\\ge 35 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. All of these planets\nexcept for two were gas-dominated giants - the two exceptions being core-dominated giants (see Table~\\ref{tab:plcompo} for definitions). For 10~m boulders\nthe abundance of solids required to build a gas giant is equivalent to a MMSN disc\nwith metallicity $1.5 \\times$ the solar value. For 100~m \nplanetesimals a solids abundance equivalent to a MMSN disc\nwith metallicity $3 \\times$ the solar value is required.\nSimulations with 1~km and 10~km planetesimals presented in\nCN14 show that giants would have formed in our runs if we had considered disc models with a total solids abundance\nequivalent to a MMSN disc with $8 \\times$ solar metallicity\n(e.g. a $4 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ disc with $2 \\times$ solar metallicity/solids-to-gas ratio.\n\nIt is noteworthy\nthat the most massive surviving (and non surviving) planets\nall formed in models with 10~m boulders. Fewer low mass planets are left at large radii in the 100~m planetesimal runs because\nplanet growth at these radii continues to larger masses in\nthese runs as the planetesimals do not migrate inwards too\nrapidly. This allows the more massive planets formed there to also migrate inwards during the gas disc life time.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig11a.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig11b.png}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig11c.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of planet mass versus orbital period\nfor models with planetesimals sizes of 100~m. \nLeft panel: Disc with low solid abundance - run K10.50.1A with\ndisc mass 1 $\\times$ MMSN, metallicity 0.5 $\\times$ solar.\nMiddle panel: Disc with medium-level solid abundance - run\nK1.510.1A with disc mass 1.5 $\\times$ MMSN, metallicity\n1 $\\times$ solar.

This is illustrated\nin Figure~\\ref{fig:MVP-tracks-disc mass}, which shows mass-period\nevolution tracks for planets in discs of varying mass and\nmetallicity for 100~m planetesimals. The left panel shows\nresults obtained from an anaemic disc with a mass $1 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ and metallicity $0.5 \\times$ solar. Moderate growth and migration is observed in the middle panel for a disc mass of $1.5 \\times {\\rm MMSN}$ and metallicity $1 \\times$ solar. The right panel\nshows the dramatic change in evolution when the solids abundance\nis raised, leading to the formation of numerous Neptune-mass \nand gas giant planets in successive bursts, with a $20 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$\ngas-rich Neptune remaining in the magnetospheric cavity at the\nend of the simulation.\n\n\\section{Comparison with observations}\n\\label{sec:comparison}\nIt is important to re-emphasise that our simulation set does not constitute an attempt at population synthesis. The aim is much simpler: to examine whether or not the model of planet formation and migration presented here is able to form planetary systems similar to those that have been observed within the context of\nplausible disc models. We have not used a Monte Carlo approach to select initial conditions from observationally derived distribution functions, and so the frequency with which different types of systems arise in our simulations is not relevant when judging whether or not the planet formation model is successful.\nComparing with observations allows us to determine whether or not the model is capable of producing planets with properties that match those of the observed population (or at least a sub-set of it), and provides a guide for understanding where model improvements are needed.\n\n\\subsection{Mass versus period}\nFigure \\ref{fig:massvperiod} is a mass versus period diagram for the surviving planets from all simulations, along with all confirmed exoplanets \\citep{exoplanets_org}.\nThe vertical dashed line located at $\\sim 4$ days shows the position of the disc inner edge in our simulations (i.e the location of the magnetospheric cavity).\n\nThe large number of long-period ($>365$ d) low mass planets\n($m_{\\rm p} \\lesssim 5 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$) produced by the simulations\narises because of the large number of runs that displayed\nlimited growth (21 out of 36 disc models). These are located in \na part of the mass-period diagram that is poorly sampled by radial velocity and transit surveys which are biased towards\nfinding massive planets on short period orbits. Microlensing surveys sample this region of\nparameter space and although relatively few planets have been\ndiscovered, constraints obtained from statistical analysis of the data suggest that planets should be common in this region of the diagram \\citep{microlensing}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{fig12.png}\n\\caption{Mass vs period plot, comparing observed exoplanets (red squares) \nwith our simulation results (blue circles) and \nthe Solar System (black diamonds). The dashed line indicates the disc inner edge of $0.05 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ \nin our simulations, whilst the grey zone indicates the habitable zone \\citep{Kasting}.}\n\\label{fig:massvperiod}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThere is good overlap between the simulation outcomes and\nthe large numbers of observed short period terrestrial/super-Earth/Neptune-mass planets. In our simulations these planets\ntend to form in compact multi-planet systems, similar to\nthose discovered by \\emph{Kepler} \\citep{Fabrycky2014} and radial velocity\nsurveys \\citep{2011arXiv1109.2497M}, as discussed in more detail below. The observational data also indicate that there are numerous\nsystems containing a single planet or which have low multiplicity. The most recent release of \\emph{Kepler} data, for example, contains more than 3000 single transiting planet candidates \\citep{Mullally2015}. In general, our simulations only produce systems with a short period planet and few objects (if any) orbiting significantly further out when a dominant object (Neptune or gas giant) forms and migrates through the system to the inner cavity. This scenario can clear other planets from the system, leading to low levels of multiplicity. Examples of where this occurred can be seen in Figure~\\ref{fig:allplanets}, which shows the final outcomes from all runs with short period planets. \nForming single planets or low multiplicity systems without a close orbiting dominant body would seem to be difficult in the planet formation scenario presented here, and this may indicate that our choice of inserting 52 planetary embryos at the beginning of the simulations does not match the mode of planet formation occurring most commonly in nature. The prevalence of single or low multiplicity systems may be an indication that planet formation often proceeds by only forming relatively few embryos, in contrast to traditional scenarios of oligarchic and giant impact growth \\citep{IdaMakino1993,ChambersWetherill1998}.\n\nThe collection of very short period planets ($P < 2$ days) with masses in the range $2 \\le m_{\\rm p} \\le 10 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ from the simulations all arose because they migrated into the magnetospheric cavity and were pushed closer to the star by an exterior body that was driving a resonant convoy. These outer planets, that stall finally near the 2:1 resonance with the cavity edge, are also apparent in Figure \\ref{fig:massvperiod} and sit in a region of parameter space where there are very few observed planets. We can ascribe these distinct orbital period features in the simulated planet population as being due to adopting a single location for the cavity edge, whereas in reality it will vary from system to system (and with time) due to differences in stellar magnetic field strengths and accretion rates through protoplanetary discs. This will have the effect of blurring the locations of the planets at the 2:1 resonance location and the\ninterior planets that have been pushed inwards. The group of\nmore massive planets at 2 days have masses that are not commonly observed, and this may be an indication that our model fails because these bodies should have accreted more gas to become part of the hot-Jupiter population (represented by observed planets with masses $\\gtrsim 100 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$), or should experience substantial evaporation of their atmospheres by stellar X-ray irradiation\non Gyr time scales  \\citep{Owen_Jackson_12}, leaving planets with smaller masses in better agreement with observations.\nErosion of the atmosphere through an evaporative wind can also exert a torque on the planet allowing the planet to migrate a few percent of its semimajor axis, if the wind is anisotropic \\citep{Teyssandier_owen15}. \n\nOne clear failing in the simulation results is the lack of surviving giant planets with masses $\\ge 100 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$. As mentioned earlier, the most massive planet to form in the simulations\nhad $m_{\\rm p}=160 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$, but migrated into the star.\nThe formation of giant planets within our simulation occurred in the inner regions of the disc (orbital radii $\\le 1 {\\, {\\rm au}}$), and\nduring times when there were significant amounts of gas remaining.  These giants always migrated into the magnetospheric cavity, before getting trapped at the 2:1 resonance with the disc inner edge. Generally, the last planet that migrated into this region survived, along with a less massive companion if the companion migrated in convoy.\nEarlier arriving planets are pushed through the inner boundary of the disc by these late arrivers. The later formation time of these surviving planets causes their masses to be smaller, as the amount of material available for accretion was reduced, explaining why there are not any genuine hot Jupiters or hot Saturns remaining at the ends of the simulations. Once again,\nthe high multiplicity of our simulated planetary systems may be causing short period giant planets to be removed from the simulations, thus reducing the level of agreement between the models and the observations. In other words, the choice of initial conditions where embryos are equitably distributed throughout the disc may lead to too many planets forming, preventing the survival of early-forming gas giants.\n\nFinally, we note that our models do not even come close to explaining the long period cold-Jupiter population. This is a feature of our simulations that was discussed at length in CN14,\nwhere it was shown that for giant planets to have formed and survived type II migration in our simulations, they would have had to have initiated runaway gas accretion at large orbital radii (typically $> 8 {\\, {\\rm au}}$) and during sufficiently late periods of the disc life time when the total disc mass remaining was less than a few tenths of a minimum mass disc.\nForming under these conditions would allow planets to undergo only a moderate amount of type II migration, allowing them to survive at large orbital radii. Trapping giant planet cores at large orbital radii until late times is difficult in our model, however, because the saturation of entropy-related corotation torques leads to rapid inwards type I migration. This point is\nillustrated by the migration contours shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:contours}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig13.png}\n\\caption{Plot comparing observed compact multi-planet systems (upper panels) with simulated systems (lower panels).\nOrbital period is indicated on the $x$-axis and planet\nmasses are indicated by the symbol size (radius scales \nwith the square-root of the planet mass) with reference sizes shown in the legend.\nMasses for observed systems are either measured masses, or where these are not available they are calculated using the formulae described in \\citet{exoplanets_org}.

A similar figure is presented in the appendix showing all of the simulated planetary systems that arose from runs resulting in either \\emph{moderate growth and migration} or \\emph{giant formation and significant migration}. \n\nInspection of the simulated planetary systems in Figure~\\ref{fig:compsystems} (and Figure~\\ref{fig:allplanets} in the appendix) shows that we obtain two basic architectures, one where either a gas-rich Neptune or a gas giant planet has migrated through the system into the inner cavity, and another where the migration has been more modest as planet masses have not grown so massive. The runs K221B, K20.50.01B, K120.1B and K1.50.50.01B displayed the latter type of behaviour, whereas runs K220.01B, K20.50.01A and K110.01A displayed the former type. We obtain outcomes in which the planets are well separated and not in resonance, such as\nK221B (for which there was a lot of scattering and growth after the gas disc dispersed) and outcomes such as K1.50.50.01B where the planets are in a chain of resonances at the end of the simulation. Note that Figure~\\ref{fig:allplanets} shows which pairs of planets in the final systems are in mean motion resonances. We also find a small number of coorbital planets at the end of the runs (3 trojan systems and 1 horseshoe system were found orbiting within 200 days across all runs. These systems are shown as being in 1:1 resonance in Figure~\\ref{fig:allplanets}). All coorbital planets were found in systems where at least one planet underwent rapid and large scale migration, causing bodies to be scattered onto eccentric orbits that quickly damped once the rapid migrator had passed through the system. This concurs with previous studies of coorbital planet formation which showed that these bodies are a direct consequence of violent relaxation in a highly dissipative environment \\citep{CresswellNelson2006}.\n\nWhile it is difficult to perform a quantitative comparison between the simulated and the observed planets, certain similarities can be noted. For example, Kepler 444 looks similar to the inner four planets of K1.50.50.01B. These four rocky-terrestrial planets were shepherded in by the exterior more massive water-rich terrestrials, and hence formed a resonant convoy. This is one way in which the Kepler 444 planets could have arrived at their observed locations and provides an alternative to \\emph{in situ} formation (but relies on there being a more massive, undetected planet orbiting further from the star). Kepler 169, 186 and 80 look similar to K20.50.01B, and Kepler 11 and 33 have broad similarities with K120.1B. Although the Kepler sample does not contain examples of compact multi-systems with massive, short period planets (perhaps because these are more dynamically disturbed and therefore not transiting or close to resonances such that they are detectable through transit timing variations), Gliese 581 and Wasp 47 provide two examples that have architectures similar to K210.1B and K220.01B.\n\n\\subsection{Period ratios and orbital spacings}\n\\label{sec:periodratios}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:resonances} compares the cumulative distributions of period ratios between neighbouring planets with masses $\\ge 1 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ and orbital periods less than 100 days obtained from the simulations (upper blue curve) and the Kepler systems (lower red curve). The sample of Kepler planets was defined by choosing bodies with orbital periods $\\le 100$ days and radii $\\ge 1 {\\rm R}_{\\oplus}$. This lower radius limit was adopted to account for possible incompleteness in the Kepler sample for planets with small radii. It is clear that the simulated systems are generally more closely packed after run times of 10 Myr, and the structure observed in the distribution shows that this is due in part to there being a number of planet pairs in resonance. The step-like features in the plot show that the 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2 and 2:1 resonances are occupied. Whereas just an isolated pair of migrating planets are\nlikely to be trapped in either the 2:1 or 3:2 resonances if they undergo smooth migration \\citep{Paardekooper2013}, we find that migration in a crowded system allows diffusion through successive resonances to\noccur such that high degree resonances can be occupied,\nin agreement with earlier studies by \\cite{CresswellNelson2006, cressnels}. Although resonant systems are relatively rare in the Kepler data, it is worth noting that Kepler 36 has two planets very close to the 7:6 resonance \\citep{Carter2012,Paardekooper2013},\nand some of the planet pairs in Kepler 444 are reported to be in 5:4 \\citep{Campante2015}. Other examples of systems in resonance or near resonance, including 3 body resonances and resonant chains, are Kepler 50 (6:5), Kepler 60 (5:4, 4:3) \\citep{Steffen2012}, Kepler 221 (3 body resonance where the mean motion combination $2 n_{\\rm in} - 5 n_{\\rm mid} + 3 n_{\\rm out}$ has been found to librate around 180 degrees) \\citep{Fabrycky2014}.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{fig15.png}\n\\caption{Histogram showing the distribution of separations between neighbouring planets with masses $\\ge 1 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$, measured in units of the mutual Hill radius.}\n\\label{fig:separations}\n\\end{figure}\nFurthermore, it has been noted in numerous studies \\citep[e.g.][]{Fabrycky2014} that the distribution of planet period ratios contains an excess of planets just outside of 3:2 and 2:1, suggesting that the resonances have been dynamically important during the evolution but may have been broken by stochastic migration in a turbulent disc \\citep{Adams2008,ReinPapaloizou2009}, by tidal interaction with the central star \\citep{TerquemPapaloizou2007}, by orbital repulsion due to damping of nonlinear spiral waves \\citep{BaruteauPapaloizou2013}, \nby overstability in librations about resonant centres \\citep{GoldreichSchlichting2014}\\textbf{, or because of scattering due to interactions with or accretion of residual planetesimals \\citep{ChatterjeeFord15}. We observe that in a handful of simulations, planetesimal scattering after full gas disc dispersal does occur, breaking mean-motion resonances between neighbouring planets, in agreement with \\citet{ChatterjeeFord15}.}\nIt is noteworthy that a number of the compact systems are orbiting in regions where their nascent protoplanetary discs are expected to have sustained MRI turbulence due to the local temperature being in excess of 1000~K \\citep{UmebayashiNakano1988}, and so may have been subjected to stochastic forcing of their orbits while the gas disc was present. To seek evidence for this transition to turbulence we have examined the minimum periods of planets in the compact Kepler multi-systems to see if they correlate with the effective temperature of the host star, but there is\nno evidence of a correlation. At present there is no clear evidence that the transition to turbulence in the inner regions of the protoplanetary discs that formed the Kepler systems played a decisive role in dynamically shaping these systems. \n     \nIt is possible that a number of our simulated systems may be dynamically unstable on time scales much longer than the 10 Myr run times, such that subsequent mutual collisions increase separations between adjacent planets. In a recent study, \\cite{PuWu2015} used N-body simulations to show that compact Kepler-like multi-planet systems tend to remain stable for Gyr time scales only if the typical mutual separation between neighbouring planets is approximately 12 mutual Hill radii. Figure~\\ref{fig:separations} shows the distribution of separations between neighbouring planets present at the end of the simulations, and while many planet pairs are well separated there are a significant number whose orbital spacings may be too small for long term stability. Running the simulations for long enough to test this goes beyond the scope of this paper, but will be studied in future work as it may be the case that the mean motion resonances discussed above provide protection against instability. We note that the objects with period ratios of unity shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:separations} are the coorbital planets mentioned previously.\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\nWe have implemented a model of planet formation based on a scenario in which numerous planetary embryos are distributed across a wide range of semimajor axes, embedded in a sea of boulders or planetesimals that act as the primary feedstock for planetary growth. The model has a comprehensive list of ingredients: planetary embryo growth through boulder/planetesimal accretion and mutual collisions; a 1D viscous gas disc model, subject to irradiation from the central star and a photoevaporative wind; type I migration using the most up-to-date prescriptions for Lindblad and corotation torques; a transition to gap formation and type II migration when gap formation criteria are satisfied; gas accretion onto solid cores. The disc has an increase in viscosity where the temperature $T > 1000$~K, to mimic unquenched MHD turbulence developing in the inner disc, and a magnetospheric cavity that creates an inner edge in the gas disc at an orbital period of 4 days. The aim of this study is to determine which types of planetary systems emerge from the planet formation model as a function of disc parameters (mass and metallicity) and planetesimal/boulder sizes. \nThe main results from our simulations can be summarised as follows.\n\n(i) System evolution can be categorised into three distinct modes that depend on the total amount of solids present in the disc and the sizes of the boulders/planetesimals. \\\\\n- When planetesimal/boulder radii are small ($\\le 100$~m) \\emph{limited planetary growth} arises when the inventory of solids is small. When planetesimal radii are large ($\\ge 1$~km), limited growth arises for all discs models considered, except the one that is the most massive and solids-rich. Planets with maximum masses $\\sim 3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ form during the gas disc life times, and show only very modest migration.\\\\\n- \\emph{Moderate growth and migration} arises in only the most solids-rich disc considered when planetesimal sizes are 1~km, and for disc models with intermediate abundances of solids when the planetesimal/boulder sizes $\\le 100$~m. Planets are able to grow to super-Earth or Neptune masses during the disc life time, and may undergo large-scale migration.\\\\\n- \\emph{Giant formation and significant migration} is observed in the most solids-abundant discs when boulder/planetesimal sizes were $\\le 100$~m, but did not arise in any of the runs with larger planetesimals. Generally, multiple episodes of planet formation occur, and gas giant planets with masses $\\ge 35 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ form and undergo large scale migration before stalling in the magnetospheric cavity.\nThe final surviving short period planets are normally the\nlast ones to arrive in the magnetospheric cavity, with the earlier arrivals being pushed through the inner boundary by the planets that arrive there later.\n\n(ii) Considering systems of short-period planets, we can identify two basic architectures that emerge from the simulations. The first normally consists of a combination of terrestrial planets, super-Earths and low mass Neptunes, where no planet managed to migrate into the magnetospheric cavity. The shortest period orbits in these systems are normally 4 -5 days. The second architecture consists of at least one dominant planet (a gas giant or a relatively massive Neptune) that migrated and stalled in the magnetospheric cavity with a period of $\\sim 2$ days. In approximately 50\\% of cases, this planet has an interior companion (terrestrial planet, super-Earth or Neptune) which is almost never in resonance because of dynamical interactions and collisions with other planets during the evolution. In most cases where a dominant short period planet formed, there are a number of exterior planets orbiting with periods in the range $5 \\lesssim P \\lesssim 80$ days.\n\n(iii) The planetary systems display a range of heterogeneity in composition versus orbital period. Systems that formed under relatively quiescent conditions, without a rapidly migrating gas giant or Neptune, have rocky\nbodies orbiting interior to volatile rich bodies. Systems \nthat contained rapidly migrating giants or Neptunes, that end up in 2 day orbits, often experienced significant scattering, and these systems can have rocky bodies in exterior orbits in close proximity to volatile-rich bodies.\n\n(iv) The planetary systems that emerge from the simulations tend to be closer packed than the observed Kepler systems. The most common spacing between neighbouring planets is\n10 - 12 mutual Hill radii, and \\citet{PuWu2015} have shown that such systems are likely stable over Gyr time scales.\nThere are, however, numerous simulated planet pairs where the ratio of spacing to mutual Hill radius $< 10$, and these might cause the systems to evolve and change their spacing through collisions if evolved beyond the 10~Myr that we have considered, improving the agreement with observations. We note, however, that mean motion resonances may help stabilise our simulated systems compared with those considered by \\citet{PuWu2015}.\n\n(v) One reason for the difference in the distributions of observed versus simulated period ratios is that mean motion resonances are common among our final planetary systems.\nWe find examples of 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2 and 2:1, with the latter three resonances being rather common. It is well known that most of the compact Kepler systems do not display mean motion resonances, even though there is evidence for the 2:1 and 3:2 resonances having been dynamically important in the past, and a few individual systems appear to host resonant pairs or triples. One possible explanation for the greater numbers of resonant systems arising in the simulations is the neglect of stochastic forces in the inner disc regions due to MHD turbulence \\citep{NelsonPapaloizou2004,Nelson2005} which can cause planets to diffuse out of resonance \\citep{Adams2008,ReinPapaloizou2009}. It remains to be seen whether or not inclusion of this effect can increase the agreement between observations and theory on the frequency of mean motion resonances. One further point worthy of note is that the frequency of resonances arising in the simulations is higher for those architectures that contain a dominant planet orbiting with a 2 day period. Systems without a dominant short period planet underwent more quiescent evolution during the gas disc life time, but also experienced more scattering after removal of the disc and this leads to systems that contain few resonances (see Figure~\\ref{fig:allplanets}). Thus, it is important to note that there is a mode of planet formation that includes large scale migration but which does not result in systems that are members of resonant chains.\n\n(vi) A number of coorbital planets were formed in our simulations (three trojan systems, and one undergoing mutual horseshoe orbits, were found to orbit with periods $< 200$ days). These all formed in systems where at least one dominant planet underwent migration through the planetary swarm, causing large amounts of scattering. In earlier work \\citet{CresswellNelson2006, cressnels} have shown that coorbital planets arise as a consequence of violent relaxation in crowded planetary systems with strong eccentricity damping,\nand our results are in agreement with these earlier findings.\n\n(vii) Numerous gas giant planets were formed in our simulations, and some survived after migrating into the magnetospheric cavity. The most massive planet to form \nwas a $160 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ gas giant, but this was pushed through the inner boundary of the computational domain by a planet that arrived in the magnetospheric cavity at a later time. The most massive surviving planet was a $70 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$  ``hot Saturn\" on a 2 day orbit. CN14 undertook a detailed examination of the conditions required for the formation and survival of longer period giant planets against type II migration, and showed that a Jovian mass planet halting its migration at $5{\\, {\\rm au}}$ needs to start runaway gas accretion and type II migration at a distance of $\\sim 15 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ from the central star. This has not occurred in any of our simulations (this paper, or CN14, or in the many low resolution test simulations that we have run and not published), because of the difficulty of forming a core and keeping it at such large orbital radius. We have concluded that forming and retaining long period giant planets requires a set of disc conditions that are quite different from those that we have considered thus far. A potential solution to the problem will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Coleman \\& Nelson in prep.).\n\n\\subsection{Formation of Kepler 444 and 42}\nThe Kepler 444 and 42 systems are examples of short period compact low mass planetary systems. All have radii substantially smaller than the Earth's. Kepler 444 is a 5-planet system orbiting a $0.76$~M$_{\\odot}$ K0V star with ${\\rm [Fe/H]} \\sim -0.55$, where the innermost orbital period is 3.6 days and the outer planets are close to the 5:4, 4:3, 5:4 and 5:4 mean motion resonances \\citep{Campante2015}. Kepler 42 is a 3-planet system orbiting a $0.13$~M$_{\\odot}$ M3V star with ${\\rm [Fe/H]} \\sim -0.3$. Orbital periods are 0.453, 1.214 and 1.865 days \\citep{Muirhead2012}, so there are no first-order mean motion resonances. We showed in Sect~\\ref{sec:results} that planet masses need to be in excess of $\\sim 3 {\\, {\\rm M}_{\\oplus}}$ for migration over large distances to be effective, and given the low metallicities of these systems they are most likely explained by \\emph{in situ} formation after delivery of solids through drag-induced drift into the disc inner regions. Although large scale migration of these\nplanets is implausible, the resonant or near-resonant configuration of the Kepler 444 planets suggests that modest migration may have occurred. The outermost planet being the largest (and presumably most massive) would lead to the necessary convergent migration.  \n\n\\subsection{Formation of short period super-Earths in low metallicity discs}\nOur simulations demonstrate how difficult it is to grow planets that are massive enough to undergo significant type I migration during the gas disc life time when growth is dominated by the accretion of large ($\\ge 1$~km) planetesimals in discs with a moderate inventory of solids. This is because growth time scales are slow for large planetesimals. In addition, if a planet approaches its local isolation mass it will not be massive enough to migrate such that it can accrete from undepleted sources of planetesimals. The situation becomes more difficult in a low metallicity environment, and the existence of short period super-Earths around stars such as Kapteyn's star \\citep{Anglada-Escude2014}, Gliese 581  \\citep{Udry2007}, HD 175607 \\citep{Mortier2015} and the numerous low-metallicity hosts of Kepler systems \\citep{Buchhave2014} suggests that these planets did not form via the classical oligarchic growth picture of widely distributed embryos accreting from a swarm of large planetesimals. These systems instead point towards planetary embryos growing into type I migrating super-Earths by accreting from a supply of highly mobile small planetesimals, boulders or pebbles \\citep[e.g.][]{OrmelKlahr2010, Lambrechts12}, as this is the only means available of exceeding local isolation masses. On the other hand, the requirement for the local solids-to-gas ratio to be approximately twice solar in order for the streaming instability to operate and generate large planetesimals that can acts as the seeds of growing planets \\citep{Johansen2009} suggests that small particles must first concentrate in specific disc regions due to the existence of zonal flows \\citep{JohansenYoudin2009,Bai2014}, vortices \\citep{FromangNelson2005} or dead zone interfaces \\citep{Lyra2009} in order to create local enhancements of solids. Such a collect-and-grow scenario would appear to offer the best hope for explaining the existence of planets in the lowest metallicity environments.    \n\n\\subsection{Future work and directions}\nThe long term aim of this project is two-fold: to construct a simulation tool for modelling planet formation that comprises accurate prescriptions for the important ingredients for planet building and evolution; to determine whether or not it is possible to explain the diversity of known planetary systems using a comprehensive model of planet formation, loosely based on the classical core accretion model, operating under different initial conditions and environments. A particular issue of interest is explaining the known population of gas giant planets, and we will present a study of this in a forthcoming paper. Areas of future improvement to our model include:\\\\\n(i) Calculation of gas envelope accretion using self-consistent computations that take account of the changing local nebula conditions, rather than using fits to the \\citet{Movs} models as is done now. The atmosphere models of \\citet{PapNelson2005} are being incorporated into the code, and results from these calculations will be presented in a forthcoming publication. \\\\\n(ii) Improving the disc model so that stellar irradiation of the disc inner regions is treated more accurately. Our 1D treatment of stellar irradiation underestimates the level of heating near the star, and this allows the temperature to fall below 1000~K everywhere in the disc at late times, such that no region of the disc maintains fully developed MRI turbulence. A more realistic treatment would allow the temperature to always be above 1000~K out to a radius $R_{1000} \\sim R_* (T_*/{\\rm 1000 \\,K})^2$, which for our model corresponds to a distance of $0.17 {\\, {\\rm au}}$ from the star.\\\\\n(iii) Include the effects of stochastic migration when planets and planetesimals enter disc regions where $T \\ge 1000$~K. This will influence the ability of planet pairs to maintain mean motion resonances. \\\\\n(iv) Improve the migration model by including 3D effects \\citep{Fung2015} and the influence of the planet luminosity \\citet{Benitez-LlambayMasset2015}. \\\\\n(v) Small boulders and planetesimals are able to migrate inwards from beyond the snow line, and in principle these should sublimate quite rapidly. We have not included submlimation in our models, and analysis of the results indicates that planets accreting icy planetesimals that have migrated interior of the ice line increase their masses by at most $3 \\%$. Nonetheless a model of planetesimal sublimation should be included for self-consistency.\n\nSimulations incorporating these improvements will be presented in future publications in order to determine how these modifications change the simulation outcomes. Once a suitably sophisticated model of planet formation has been constructed it will be used to generate a synthetic planet population based on initial conditions and physical parameters drawn from observational constraints to determine the level of agreement with exoplanet observations.\n\n\\appendix\n\\section{Presentation of all simulated compact systems}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:allplanets} shows all of the compact systems that formed and survived in the simulations. The planets shown in the upper panels all formed in simulations classified as \\emph{giant formation and significant migration}, and the rest formed in simulations classified as \\emph{moderate growth and migration}. Pairs of planets that are coorbital or are in first order mean motion resonances are indicated by the integers printed above and between the relevant pair.\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figA1.png}\n\\caption{Plot showing all compact multi-planet systems formed in the simulations.
