By  $\\zeta$ we denotes the material parameters (i.e. the parameters through which the individual nature of the physical systems under consideration is expressed) and $\\Omega^{meso}$ denotes the external forces.  In the third step,  the governing equations (\\ref{Gdyn}) are solved and the solutions are compared with results of observations. If the comparison is satisfactory, the model represented by (\\ref{Gdyn}) is called a well established mesoscopic dynamical model (e.g. the Boussinesq model is a well established model of the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard systems).\nThe choice of state variables $y$ in the second step is usually made   by trying to formulate the simplest possible model in the sense that the chosen state variables are as close as possible to the quantities observed in the meso-experiments. The original derivation of the Boussinesq equations constituting the dynamic model of the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard system provides a classical example of the direct derivation. The chosen mesoscopic level is in this example the level of fluid mechanics (the classical hydrodynamic fields serve as state variables $y$). The comparison made in the third step shows indeed agreement between predictions of the model and results of experimental observations.\n\n\n\n\n We now pick one well established mesoscopic model (e.g. the Boussinesq model).\nThere are  immediately two conclusions that we  can  draw. The first one is that there exist more microscopic levels (i.e. levels involving more details) on which the physical system under investigation can be described. This is because the level chosen in the mesoscopic model is a mesoscopic level (e.g. the level of fluid mechanics) on which many microscopic details that appear to be irrelevant to our interests (determined by the way we observe the externally driven system under consideration experimentally and by intended applications) are ignored. We recall that one such level that always exists and that we can always choose is the most microscopic level  on which states of  macroscopic systems are described by position vectors and velocities of\n$\\sim 10^{23}$ particles composing them  (provided we remain in the realm of classical physics). The second conclusion is that\nif we   choose one such more microscopic description and we found it to be well established (i.e. its predictions agree with results of more detailed experimental observations),  then we have to be able to see in solutions to its governing equations the following two types of dynamics:  (i)   reducing dynamics describing  approach to the dynamics described in the mesoscopic model, and (ii)  reduced dynamics that is the mesoscopic dynamics described in the mesoscopic model.  This is because both the original mesoscopic model and the more microscopic model have been found to be well established. Following further the second conclusion, we see that\nwe have now an alternative way to derive the governing equations of our original mesoscopic model. In addition to its direct mesoscopic derivation described above in the first paragraph, we can derive it also by constructing first a more microscopic model and then recognizing  the mesoscopic model as a pattern in  solutions to its governing equations. This new way of deriving the mesoscopic model seems to be complicated and indeed, it is  rarely used. Nevertheless, it is important that this alternative way of derivation exists and that, by following it,  we arrive at least at two new results: (a) the material parameters $\\zeta$ through which the individual nature of macroscopic systems is expressed in  the mesoscopic model (\\ref{Gdyn}) appear as  functions  of the material parameters playing the same role in the more microscopic model, and (b) the reducing dynamics, giving rise to thermodynamics (as we show in Section \\ref{T}) emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above consideration motivates us to start our investigation of externally forced macroscopic systems with two mesoscopic  models instead of with only one such model\n(\\ref{Gdyn}). The second model is formulated on a more microscopic level than the level on which the model (\\ref{Gdyn}) is formulated. By \"a more microscopic model\" we mean that  more details are taken into account in the model.\nWe write the governing equations of the second model formally as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6296, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\\title{\\textbf{ Externally driven macroscopic systems: Dynamics versus Thermodynamics}}\n\\author{Miroslav Grmela\\footnote{ e-mail:\nmiroslav.grmela@polymtl.ca}\\vspace{0.5cm}\\\\\n\\'{E}cole Polytechnique de Montr\\'{e}al,\\\\\n  C.P.6079 suc.

The mesoscopic level on which the physics is regarded in this example is the level of fluid mechanics,\nthe system itself is  a horizontal layer of fluid heated from below (Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard system), and the external driving forces are the gravitational force and  imposed temperature gradient.  Analysis of solutions of the Boussinesq  equations reveal properties observed in experiments (e.g. the observed\npassage from less organized to a more organized behavior presents itself as a bifurcation in solutions). Many other examples of this type can be found for instance in \\cite{Halp}. One of the common features of the dynamical equations that arise in the examples (the feature that has been noted in \\cite{Halp}) is that  there does not seem to be possible, at least in general, to associate them\nwith  a potential  whose landscape would provide a pertinent  information about their solutions [\\textit{ \"... there is no evidence for any global minimization principles controlling the structure ...\" - see the last paragraph of Conclusion in \\cite{Halp}}].  Since potential (or potentials) of this type are essential in any type of thermodynamics, the observed common feature seems to point to the conclusion that  there is no thermodynamics  of externally driven systems.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, there is a long tradition (starting  with Prigogine in \\cite{Prigogine}) of  investigating  externally driven systems with methods of thermodynamics.\nRoughly speaking, responses of macroscopic systems to external forces are seen as adaptations  minimizing their resistance.  The thermodynamic potentials involved in this type of considerations (i.e.  potentials used to characterize the \"resistance\") are usually various versions  of the work done by external forces and the  entropy production. There are many examples of very successful and very useful considerations of this type  (see e.g. \\cite{Umb}). In Section \\ref{Ill} we illustrate the  thermodynamic analysis in the context of an investigation of the  morphology of immiscible blends. Specifically, we show how the thermodynamic argument  provides an estimate of concentrations at the point of phase inversion, i.e. at the point at which the morphology of a mixture of two  immiscible fluids  changes in such a way that the roles of being encircled and encircling  changes (i.e. the continuous phase and the dispersed phase exchange their roles).\n\n\n\nThe experience  collected in investigations of externally driven systems can be thus summed up  by saying that mesoscopic\ndynamical modeling indicates an impossibility of  using thermodynamics-like arguments yet  this type of arguments are often found to be very useful and pertinent. There are in fact well known examples \\cite{Keizer}  in which both dynamic and thermodynamic approaches were developed and the potentials used in the thermodynamic analysis are proven  to play no significant role in  the dynamic analysis.\nOur objective in this paper is to suggest an explanation of this apparent contradiction. We show that the dynamic and the thermodynamic analysis made on a given mesoscopic level of description are not directly related. Their relation is indirect.  They are both two aspects of a single dynamic analysis  made on a more microscopic (i.e. involving more details) level of description. An investigation of the way the microscopic dynamics is reducing to the mesoscopic dynamics  provides the  mesoscopic thermodynamics and the investigation of the final result of the reduction provides the mesoscopic dynamics.\nIn Section \\ref{D} we discuss the  reduced dynamics and in Section \\ref{T} the dynamics making the reduction.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to emphasize that we are using in this paper  the term \"thermodynamics\"  in a general sense (explained in Section \\ref{T}). While the  classical equilibrium thermodynamics and the Gibbs equilibrium statistical mechanics are particular examples of the general thermodynamics presented in Section \\ref{T}, they are not the ones  that are the  most pertinent for discussing externally driven systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Mesoscopic models }\\label{Models}\n\n\n\nGiven an externally driven system (or a family of such systems), how do we formulate its dynamical model?\nThe most common way to do it (called hereafter a direct derivation) proceeds in the following three steps. First, behavior of the externally driven macroscopic systems under consideration  is observed experimentally in certain types of measurements called hereafter \\textit{meso-measurements}. In the second step, the experience collected in the  meso-measurements together with  an insight into the physics taking place in the observed systems leads to the choice of the level of description, i.e. the choice of state variables (we shall denote them by the symbol $y$), and equations\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{Gdyn}\n\\dot{y}=g(y,\\zeta, \\Omega^{meso})\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\dot{y}=g(y,\\zeta,\\Omega^{meso})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>y</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03b6</mi><mo>,</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi></mrow></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07151.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $x$ denotes state variables, $\\xi$ material parameters and $\\Omega^{MESO}$ the external influence. The state space used in the mesoscopic model (\\ref{Gdyn}) is denoted by the symbol $N$ (i.e. $y\\in N$ ) and the state space used on the more microscopic model (\\ref{Fdyn}) is denoted by the symbol $M$ (i.e. $x\\in M$).  We shall call hereafter  the dynamics described by (\\ref{Fdyn}) as \\textit{MESO-dynamics} and the dynamics described by (\\ref{Gdyn}) by \\textit{meso-dynamics}. The mesoscopic level of description on which meso-dynamics is formulated will be called \\textit{meso-level}. The level on which MESO-dynamics is formulated will be called \\textit{MESO-level}. The most microscopic level,\ni.e. the level on which the state variable $x$ are position vectors and momenta of all $\\sim 10^{23}$ particles composing the macroscopic system, will be called \\textit{MICRO-level}.\n\n\nHow do we formulate the MESO-model (\\ref{Fdyn})? In its direct derivation we  proceed in the same way as we do in the direct derivation of the mesoscopic model (\\ref{Gdyn}). The difference is only in that the meso-measurements are replaced by more detailed \\textit{MESO-measurements} and that the same type of physics as the one expressed in (\\ref{Gdyn}) is now  expressed in (\\ref{Fdyn}) in a more detail.\n\n\n\nAs an example of meso-dynamics  (\\ref{Gdyn})    we can take Boussinesq equations describing, on the level of fluid mechanics (i.e. the meso-level in this example is the level of fluid mechanics), the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard system. The corresponding to it MESO-level could be the level of kinetic theory on which the state variable $x$ is the one particle distribution function and Eq.(\\ref{Fdyn}) is a kinetic equation expressing the same physics as the one expressed in the Boussinesq equations but on the level of kinetic theory.\n\n\n\nHaving  both MESO- and meso-dynamics,  we are in position to provide a new derivation of the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}). In addition to its original direct derivation we can derive it from the more microscopic MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}). This is because both MESO- and meso-dynamics are assumed to be well established (i.e. both compare well with experimental observations). This then means that  by starting to observe the behavior of the macroscopic system under consideration at the more microscopic level we have to be able to recognize the behavior observed on the meso-level as a pattern in the phase portrait corresponding to MESO-dynamics. By a phase portrait corresponding to MESO-dynamics we  mean a collection of trajectories (i.e. solutions to (\\ref{Fdyn}) ) passing through all $x\\in M$ for a large family of the material parameters $\\xi$ and external forces $\\Omega^{MESO}$. The pattern that we search is the one which can be interpreted as representing the mesoscopic phase portrait corresponding to the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}).\nWe prefer to refer to  the process involved in  the passage from MESO- to meso-dynamics as to a pattern recognition process rather than the more frequently used  \"coarse graining\" process  since the latter term evokes   procedures (as e.g. making pixels and averaging in them) that are manifestly coordinate dependent and thus geometrically (and consequently also physically) meaningless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Reduced dynamics}\\label{D}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now proceed to investigate the pattern recognition process leading from MESO-dynamics to meso-dynamics. First,  we recognize  the  complexity of such investigation. We recall for instance that this type of analysis constitutes  in fact   the famous Hilbet's 6th problem (see \\cite{GKHilb}). Before entering into more details, we note that any investigation of the $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\,meso $ passage consists essentially in splitting the MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn})  into the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}) (that we call  \\textit{reduced dynamics} if we regard it in the context of $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\,meso$ passage) and another dynamics that makes the reduction (that we  call \\textit{reducing dynamics}). Focus of most investigations of  $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\,meso $ passages has been on the identification of the reduced dynamics. The main contribution of this paper is to show that investigations of the reducing dynamics are also interesting and bring in fact an additional important information that  can be  interpreted  as  an introduction of thermodynamics on the meso-level. The reduced dynamics (i.e. meso-dynamics) together with the thermodynamics  implied by the reducing dynamics  express then (on the mesoscopic level)  the complete physics of the macroscopic system under consideration. In the rest of this section we  recall  the reduced dynamics. The reducing dynamics and associated with it thermodynamics are discussed in the next section.\n\n\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}^{MESO}$ and $\\mathcal{P}^{meso}$ be the phase portraits corresponding to  the MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}) and the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}) respectively. Our problem is to recognize $\\mathcal{P}^{meso}$ as a pattern inside of $\\mathcal{P}^{MESO}$. While this viewpoint of the MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso reduction does provide  a good intuitive understanding of the process, it does not provide a practical way to proceed. The archetype method offering such procedure is the Chapman-Enskog method (see e.g. \\cite{GKHilb}).  This method  was originally developed for reducing the  Boltzmann kinetic equation to the  Navier-Stokes-Fourier hydrodynamic equations  but it can be applied to any MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso passage. The pattern recognition process becomes in the context of the Chapman-Enskog method the process of identifying a manifold $\\mathcal{M}\\subset M$ that satisfies the following two requirements: (i) $\\mathcal{M}$  is in   one-to-one relation to $N$, (ii) $\\mathcal{M}$ is quasi-invariant (i.e. $\\mathcal{M}$ is \"as much as possible\" invariant with respect to the MESO-time evolution taking place on $M$).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe shall sketch below the geometrical essence of the method in three steps.\n\\\\\n\n\n\\textit{Chapman-Enskog, Step 1}\n\nBy using an insight into the physics involved in the MESO-dynamics,  we write the MESO vector field $G$ as a sum of $G_0$, playing the dominant role, and $G_1$ that is seen as a perturbation (i.e. we write $G=G_0+G_1$).\nThe splitting of the vector field $G$  induces  then splitting of the search of the quasi invariant manifold $\\mathcal{M}\\subset M$ into two stages. A first approximation\n$\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ (called zero Chapman-Enskog approximation) is identified in the first stage (the second step in the Chapman-Enskog method) with neglecting $G_1$ (i.e. we consider $G=G_0$). In the second stage (the third step in the Chapman-Enskog method) the manifold   $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$\nis  deformed  into   $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$   that is called a first Chapman-Enskog approximation of $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n\n\nIn the case of (\\ref{Fdyn}) being the Boltzmann kinetic equation, $G_0$ is the Boltzmann collision term (since the pieces of the trajectories involving binary collisions are seen as being dominant in the phase portrait $\\mathcal{P}^{MESO}$).\n\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textit{Chapman-Enskog, Step 2}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step we identify $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$. We define it as a manifold\non which the dominant vector field $G_0$ disappears (i.e. we solve the equation $[G_0]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}=0$). The quantities that parametrize $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ are then chosen to be the meso state variables $y$ expressed in terms of the MESO state variables $x$. We thus obtain a mapping $\\Pi:M\\rightarrow N; x\\mapsto y$. This mapping  subsequently induces a one-to-one  mapping $\\Pi^{(\\mathcal{M})}:\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rightarrow N$. Next, the vector field $[G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$ is  projected (by the projection induced by $\\Pi^{(\\mathcal{M})}$ ) on the tangent space of $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$. We denote the projected vector field by the symbol  $G^{(0)}$. Finally, the vector field $G^{(0)}$  is projected (again by the projection induced by $\\Pi^{(\\mathcal{M})}$)  on the tangent space of  $N$. This is then   the vector field on $N$,  denoted by $g^{(0)}$ and called a zero Chapman-Enskog approximation of $G$ on $N$.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}) being the Boltzmann kinetic theory, the mapping $\\Pi$ is the standard mapping from  one particle distribution functions  to  hydrodynamic fields,  $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ is the manifold whose elements are local Maxwell  distribution functions, and $g^{(0)}$ is the right hand side of the  Euler (reversible and nondissipative) hydrodynamic equations.\n\\\\\n\n\n\n\\textit{Chapman-Enskog, Step 3}\n\n\nThe first Chapman-Enskog approximation  $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ is found in this step.\nWe note that the manifold $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ is not an invariant manifold since the vectors  $[G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$ do not lie in the tangent spaces attached to $x_0\\in \\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$. We want to make it more invariant. We therefore deform\n$\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ into $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ $( x_0\\mapsto x_1)$  in such a way  that $G^{(1)}\\equiv [G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$, where $G^{(1)}$ is the vector field $G$ attached to the points $x_1$ and projected on $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$. We note that the manifold $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ is still not invariant (since, in general,  $[G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}}\\neq [G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$) but it is expected to  be \"more\" invariant than $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ since the vector field $G_1$ is just a perturbation of $G_0$ (and consequently the deformation $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ is small). The vector field $g^{(1)}$ projected on $N$ is the first Chapman-Enskog approximation of $G$.\n\n\n\nIn the case of (\\ref{Fdyn}) being the Boltzmann equation,  the vector field   $g^{(1)}$ is  the right hand side of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (irreversible and dissipative) hydrodynamic equations.\n\n\nIf both  MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}) and  meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}) are known and well established (i.e. they both have emerged from direct derivations involving MESO-measurements and meso-measurements respectively) then  the Chapman-Enskog type derivation of (\\ref{Gdyn}) from (\\ref{Fdyn}) brings an additional information.  First, the domain of applicability of (\\ref{Gdyn}) inside of the domain of applicability of (\\ref{Fdyn}) is identified, and second,  mapping $\\xi \\mapsto \\zeta$ emerges (i.e. the material parameters $\\zeta$ with which individual features of the systems under consideration are expressed  on the meso-level become functions of the material parameters $\\xi$ used for the same purpose on the MESO-level). We shall make additional comments about the Chapman-Enskog method in Section \\ref{thCE}.\n\n\n\nExamples of applications of the Chapman-Enskog method in many types of mesoscopic dynamics (including for instance the dynamics describing chemical reactions) can be found in \\cite{Gorbbook}, \\cite{GKHilb}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Reducing  dynamics; Thermodynamics }\\label{T}\n\n\n\nMore details of the behavior\nof the macroscopic systems under consideration are seen on the MESO-level (represented by (\\ref{Fdyn}) ) than on the meso-level.\nIn the pattern recognition process involved in the passage MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso  we, first of all,  recover   the less detailed viewpoint expressed in (\\ref{Gdyn}) (that arises in the pattern recognition process as the reduced dynamics). Is there anything else that the pattern recognition process transfers from the MESO-level to   the meso-level? In this section we shall argue that the answer is affirmative. The additional information on the meso-level, that   comes from investigating  the reducing dynamics, is in its essence thermodynamics.\nIn order to be able to justify the use of the term \"thermodynamics\"   we begin by recalling  the standard (i.e. Gibbs) formulation of the classical thermodynamics and show subsequently  that   the reducing dynamics is indeed its natural extension.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Equilibrium thermodynamics}\\label{ET}\n\nThe point of departure of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics is the postulate (\\textit{\\textbf{Equilibrium Postulate 0}}) of the \\textit{existence of equilibrium states}. For example,  Callen formulates \\cite{Callen} it as follows: [\\textit{\"... in all systems there is a tendency to evolve toward states in which the properties are determined by intrinsic factors and not by previously applied external influences. Such simple terminal states are, by definition, time independent. They are called equilibrium states...\"}]. The level of description on which  investigations  are limited only to macroscopic systems  at equilibrium states will be called \\textit{equilibrium-level}. No time evolution takes place on this level.\n\n\n\nThe next postulate (\\textit{\\textbf{Equilibrium Postulate I}}) addresses the \\textit{state variables} used on the equilibrium-level to characterize  the equilibrium states. They  are the state variables needed to formulate overall macroscopic mechanics (the number of moles $N$,  the volume $V$, and the macroscopic mechanical kinetic energy $E_{mech}$)  and in addition the internal energy $E_{int}$ that is a new, extra mechanical quantity,  serving  as an independent state variable. The internal energy $E_{int}$ then combines with the macroscopic mechanical $E_{mech}$ to define the\noverall total  energy   $E=E_{mech}+E_{int}$. We shall denote the state variables of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics by the symbol $y_{eq}$  (i.e. $y_{eq}=(E,N,V)$) an the equilibrium state space $N_{eq}$ (i.e. $y_{eq}\\in N_{eq}$).\n\n\nThe third postulate (\\textit{\\textbf{Equilibrium Postulate II}}) addresses the way the equilibrium states are reached. \\textit{The equilibrium states are the states at which the entropy reaches its maximum allowed by constraints - the so called MaxEnt principle}.\nThe entropy  is a real valued function  of the equilibrium state variables (the function $S=S(E,V,N)$ is called a fundamental thermodynamic relation) that is required to satisfy certain properties. It is in the fundamental thermodynamic relation $S=S(E,V,N)$ where the individual nature of the macroscopic systems under consideration is expressed. The association between the fundamental thermodynamic relations and the macroscopic systems can be obtained, if we remain inside the level of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics, only by experimental observations (presented in the so called thermodynamic tables).  The maximization of the entropy at equilibrium sates  brings into importance the derivatives of $S$ with respect to $(E,V,N)$. They  are called conjugate state variables and are denoted $(E^*,V^*,N^*)$. In the classical equilibrium thermodynamics they have particular names,  namely,  $E^*=S_E=\\frac{1}{T}, N^*=S_N=-\\frac{\\mu}{T}, V^*=S_V=-\\frac{P}{T}$, where $T$ is the temperature, $\\mu$ the chemical potential, and $P$ the pressure. We use hereafter the notation: $S_E=\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E}$,... .  The fundamental thermodynamic relation $S=S(E,V,N)$ transforms, under the  Legendre transformation, into its conjugate form $S^*=S^*(\\mu,T)$. As a direct consequence of one of the properties required from $S=S(E,V,N)$, namely the homogeneity $\\lambda S=S(\\lambda E,\\lambda V,\\lambda N)$, where $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $S^*=-\\frac{P}{VT}$.\n\n\nWe note that the MaxEnt principle in the classical equilibrium thermodynamics does not address the time evolution leading to the equilibrium states (i.e. it does not address the process of preparing macroscopic systems to equilibrium thermodynamic observations). It addresses only the question of what is the final result of such time evolution.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{MICRO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium; Gibbs equilibrium statistical mechanics }\\label{GET}\n\n\nAnother part of the classical equilibrium theory  is the Gibbs equilibrium statistical mechanics that investigates the passage  $MICRO \\rightarrow equilibrium$. We shall formulate the physical basis of the Gibbs theory again in three postulates.\n\n\nThe first postulate, Postulate 0,  is the same as in the classical equilibrium thermodynamics except that we include in it also the statement that the MICRO-level is well established.\n\n\n\nThe second postulate, \\textit{\\textbf{MICRO$\\rightarrow$ equilibrium Postulate I}}, addresses   the state variables on the MICRO-level and two potentials, namely the number of moles $N$ and the energy $E$. \\textit{The state variables on MICRO-level\nare position vectors ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}=({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}_1,...,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}_N)$ and momenta ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}=({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,...,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_N)$ of $N$ particles, $N\\sim 10^{23}$, (or alternatively the $N$-particle distribution function $f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$). The potentials are $N(f)=\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ (i.e. the normalization of the distribution function), and $E(f)=\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} E^{(MICRO)}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}) f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$, where $E^{(MICRO)}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ is the mechanical energy of the $N$ particles under consideration}.\n\n\n\nNext, we proceed to the third postulate that addresses the time evolution.  Since the reduced time evolution in the passage MICRO$\\rightarrow$ equilibrium is no time evolution,  the time evolution taking place on the MICRO-level is the reducing time evolution. The MICRO-level time evolution $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_0\\mapsto({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_t$ is governed by Hamilton's equations $\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\dot{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}}\\\\ \\dot{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\\\-1&0\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}E^{(MICRO)}_{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}}\\\\E^{(MICRO)}_{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}\\end{array}\\right)$, where $E^{(MICRO)}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ is the microscopic energy. This microscopic time evolution induces the time evolution $f_0({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})\\mapsto f_t({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})=f_0(({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_{-t})$. In the third postulate,\n\\textit{\\textbf{MICRO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium Postulate II}}, the only thing that is retained in the Gibbs theory from the reducing microscopic dynamics can be summed up in the following three points:\n\n(i)  \\textit{The number of particles $N(f)$ and the energy $E(f)$ are conserved during the time evolution}.\n\n\n\n(ii) \\textit{Particle trajectories $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_0\\mapsto({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_t$ fill up the microscopic phase space $M^{(MICRO)}$ (i.e. $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})\\in M^{(MICRO)}$)  so that time averages can be replaced with  averages (by using certain measures)  in  $M^{(MICRO)}$ (\\textit{the ergodic hypothesis})}.\n\n\n\n\n(iii)  \\textit{Equilibrium states are defined as states at which the entropy  $S(f)$  reaches its maximum allowed by constraints (i.e. MaxEnt principle for  the MICRO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium passage).

If the comparison is satisfactory, the model represented by (\\ref{Gdyn}) is called a well established mesoscopic dynamical model (e.g. the Boussinesq model is a well established model of the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard systems).\nThe choice of state variables $y$ in the second step is usually made   by trying to formulate the simplest possible model in the sense that the chosen state variables are as close as possible to the quantities observed in the meso-experiments. The original derivation of the Boussinesq equations constituting the dynamic model of the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard system provides a classical example of the direct derivation. The chosen mesoscopic level is in this example the level of fluid mechanics (the classical hydrodynamic fields serve as state variables $y$). The comparison made in the third step shows indeed agreement between predictions of the model and results of experimental observations.\n\n\n\n\n We now pick one well established mesoscopic model (e.g. the Boussinesq model).\nThere are  immediately two conclusions that we  can  draw. The first one is that there exist more microscopic levels (i.e. levels involving more details) on which the physical system under investigation can be described. This is because the level chosen in the mesoscopic model is a mesoscopic level (e.g. the level of fluid mechanics) on which many microscopic details that appear to be irrelevant to our interests (determined by the way we observe the externally driven system under consideration experimentally and by intended applications) are ignored. We recall that one such level that always exists and that we can always choose is the most microscopic level  on which states of  macroscopic systems are described by position vectors and velocities of\n$\\sim 10^{23}$ particles composing them  (provided we remain in the realm of classical physics). The second conclusion is that\nif we   choose one such more microscopic description and we found it to be well established (i.e. its predictions agree with results of more detailed experimental observations),  then we have to be able to see in solutions to its governing equations the following two types of dynamics:  (i)   reducing dynamics describing  approach to the dynamics described in the mesoscopic model, and (ii)  reduced dynamics that is the mesoscopic dynamics described in the mesoscopic model.  This is because both the original mesoscopic model and the more microscopic model have been found to be well established. Following further the second conclusion, we see that\nwe have now an alternative way to derive the governing equations of our original mesoscopic model. In addition to its direct mesoscopic derivation described above in the first paragraph, we can derive it also by constructing first a more microscopic model and then recognizing  the mesoscopic model as a pattern in  solutions to its governing equations. This new way of deriving the mesoscopic model seems to be complicated and indeed, it is  rarely used. Nevertheless, it is important that this alternative way of derivation exists and that, by following it,  we arrive at least at two new results: (a) the material parameters $\\zeta$ through which the individual nature of macroscopic systems is expressed in  the mesoscopic model (\\ref{Gdyn}) appear as  functions  of the material parameters playing the same role in the more microscopic model, and (b) the reducing dynamics, giving rise to thermodynamics (as we show in Section \\ref{T}) emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above consideration motivates us to start our investigation of externally forced macroscopic systems with two mesoscopic  models instead of with only one such model\n(\\ref{Gdyn}). The second model is formulated on a more microscopic level than the level on which the model (\\ref{Gdyn}) is formulated. By \"a more microscopic model\" we mean that  more details are taken into account in the model.\nWe write the governing equations of the second model formally as\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{Fdyn}\n\\dot{x}=G(x,\\xi, \\Omega^{MESO})\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\dot{x}=G(x,\\xi,\\Omega^{MESO})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>x</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03be</mi><mo>,</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>O</mi></mrow></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07151.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere  $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,  is on the MICRO-level universal.

We shall call hereafter  the dynamics described by (\\ref{Fdyn}) as \\textit{MESO-dynamics} and the dynamics described by (\\ref{Gdyn}) by \\textit{meso-dynamics}. The mesoscopic level of description on which meso-dynamics is formulated will be called \\textit{meso-level}. The level on which MESO-dynamics is formulated will be called \\textit{MESO-level}.

In its direct derivation we  proceed in the same way as we do in the direct derivation of the mesoscopic model (\\ref{Gdyn}). The difference is only in that the meso-measurements are replaced by more detailed \\textit{MESO-measurements} and that the same type of physics as the one expressed in (\\ref{Gdyn}) is now  expressed in (\\ref{Fdyn}) in a more detail.\n\n\n\nAs an example of meso-dynamics  (\\ref{Gdyn})    we can take Boussinesq equations describing, on the level of fluid mechanics (i.e. the meso-level in this example is the level of fluid mechanics), the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard system. The corresponding to it MESO-level could be the level of kinetic theory on which the state variable $x$ is the one particle distribution function and Eq.(\\ref{Fdyn}) is a kinetic equation expressing the same physics as the one expressed in the Boussinesq equations but on the level of kinetic theory.\n\n\n\nHaving  both MESO- and meso-dynamics,  we are in position to provide a new derivation of the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}). In addition to its original direct derivation we can derive it from the more microscopic MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}). This is because both MESO- and meso-dynamics are assumed to be well established (i.e. both compare well with experimental observations). This then means that  by starting to observe the behavior of the macroscopic system under consideration at the more microscopic level we have to be able to recognize the behavior observed on the meso-level as a pattern in the phase portrait corresponding to MESO-dynamics. By a phase portrait corresponding to MESO-dynamics we  mean a collection of trajectories (i.e. solutions to (\\ref{Fdyn}) ) passing through all $x\\in M$ for a large family of the material parameters $\\xi$ and external forces $\\Omega^{MESO}$. The pattern that we search is the one which can be interpreted as representing the mesoscopic phase portrait corresponding to the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}).\nWe prefer to refer to  the process involved in  the passage from MESO- to meso-dynamics as to a pattern recognition process rather than the more frequently used  \"coarse graining\" process  since the latter term evokes   procedures (as e.g. making pixels and averaging in them) that are manifestly coordinate dependent and thus geometrically (and consequently also physically) meaningless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Reduced dynamics}\\label{D}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now proceed to investigate the pattern recognition process leading from MESO-dynamics to meso-dynamics. First,  we recognize  the  complexity of such investigation. We recall for instance that this type of analysis constitutes  in fact   the famous Hilbet's 6th problem (see \\cite{GKHilb}). Before entering into more details, we note that any investigation of the $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\,meso $ passage consists essentially in splitting the MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn})  into the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}) (that we call  \\textit{reduced dynamics} if we regard it in the context of $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\,meso$ passage) and another dynamics that makes the reduction (that we  call \\textit{reducing dynamics}). Focus of most investigations of  $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\,meso $ passages has been on the identification of the reduced dynamics. The main contribution of this paper is to show that investigations of the reducing dynamics are also interesting and bring in fact an additional important information that  can be  interpreted  as  an introduction of thermodynamics on the meso-level. The reduced dynamics (i.e. meso-dynamics) together with the thermodynamics  implied by the reducing dynamics  express then (on the mesoscopic level)  the complete physics of the macroscopic system under consideration. In the rest of this section we  recall  the reduced dynamics. The reducing dynamics and associated with it thermodynamics are discussed in the next section.\n\n\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}^{MESO}$ and $\\mathcal{P}^{meso}$ be the phase portraits corresponding to  the MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}) and the meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}) respectively. Our problem is to recognize $\\mathcal{P}^{meso}$ as a pattern inside of $\\mathcal{P}^{MESO}$. While this viewpoint of the MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso reduction does provide  a good intuitive understanding of the process, it does not provide a practical way to proceed. The archetype method offering such procedure is the Chapman-Enskog method (see e.g. \\cite{GKHilb}).  This method  was originally developed for reducing the  Boltzmann kinetic equation to the  Navier-Stokes-Fourier hydrodynamic equations  but it can be applied to any MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso passage. The pattern recognition process becomes in the context of the Chapman-Enskog method the process of identifying a manifold $\\mathcal{M}\\subset M$ that satisfies the following two requirements: (i) $\\mathcal{M}$  is in   one-to-one relation to $N$, (ii) $\\mathcal{M}$ is quasi-invariant (i.e. $\\mathcal{M}$ is \"as much as possible\" invariant with respect to the MESO-time evolution taking place on $M$).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe shall sketch below the geometrical essence of the method in three steps.\n\\\\\n\n\n\\textit{Chapman-Enskog, Step 1}\n\nBy using an insight into the physics involved in the MESO-dynamics,  we write the MESO vector field $G$ as a sum of $G_0$, playing the dominant role, and $G_1$ that is seen as a perturbation (i.e. we write $G=G_0+G_1$).\nThe splitting of the vector field $G$  induces  then splitting of the search of the quasi invariant manifold $\\mathcal{M}\\subset M$ into two stages. A first approximation\n$\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ (called zero Chapman-Enskog approximation) is identified in the first stage (the second step in the Chapman-Enskog method) with neglecting $G_1$ (i.e. we consider $G=G_0$). In the second stage (the third step in the Chapman-Enskog method) the manifold   $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$\nis  deformed  into   $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$   that is called a first Chapman-Enskog approximation of $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n\n\nIn the case of (\\ref{Fdyn}) being the Boltzmann kinetic equation, $G_0$ is the Boltzmann collision term (since the pieces of the trajectories involving binary collisions are seen as being dominant in the phase portrait $\\mathcal{P}^{MESO}$).\n\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textit{Chapman-Enskog, Step 2}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step we identify $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$. We define it as a manifold\non which the dominant vector field $G_0$ disappears (i.e. we solve the equation $[G_0]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}=0$). The quantities that parametrize $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ are then chosen to be the meso state variables $y$ expressed in terms of the MESO state variables $x$. We thus obtain a mapping $\\Pi:M\\rightarrow N; x\\mapsto y$. This mapping  subsequently induces a one-to-one  mapping $\\Pi^{(\\mathcal{M})}:\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rightarrow N$. Next, the vector field $[G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$ is  projected (by the projection induced by $\\Pi^{(\\mathcal{M})}$ ) on the tangent space of $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$. We denote the projected vector field by the symbol  $G^{(0)}$. Finally, the vector field $G^{(0)}$  is projected (again by the projection induced by $\\Pi^{(\\mathcal{M})}$)  on the tangent space of  $N$. This is then   the vector field on $N$,  denoted by $g^{(0)}$ and called a zero Chapman-Enskog approximation of $G$ on $N$.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}) being the Boltzmann kinetic theory, the mapping $\\Pi$ is the standard mapping from  one particle distribution functions  to  hydrodynamic fields,  $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ is the manifold whose elements are local Maxwell  distribution functions, and $g^{(0)}$ is the right hand side of the  Euler (reversible and nondissipative) hydrodynamic equations.\n\\\\\n\n\n\n\\textit{Chapman-Enskog, Step 3}\n\n\nThe first Chapman-Enskog approximation  $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ of $\\mathcal{M}$ is found in this step.\nWe note that the manifold $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ is not an invariant manifold since the vectors  $[G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$ do not lie in the tangent spaces attached to $x_0\\in \\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$. We want to make it more invariant. We therefore deform\n$\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ into $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ $( x_0\\mapsto x_1)$  in such a way  that $G^{(1)}\\equiv [G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$, where $G^{(1)}$ is the vector field $G$ attached to the points $x_1$ and projected on $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$. We note that the manifold $\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ is still not invariant (since, in general,  $[G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(1)}}\\neq [G]_{\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}}$) but it is expected to  be \"more\" invariant than $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ since the vector field $G_1$ is just a perturbation of $G_0$ (and consequently the deformation $\\mathcal{M}^{(0)}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ is small). The vector field $g^{(1)}$ projected on $N$ is the first Chapman-Enskog approximation of $G$.\n\n\n\nIn the case of (\\ref{Fdyn}) being the Boltzmann equation,  the vector field   $g^{(1)}$ is  the right hand side of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (irreversible and dissipative) hydrodynamic equations.\n\n\nIf both  MESO-dynamics (\\ref{Fdyn}) and  meso-dynamics (\\ref{Gdyn}) are known and well established (i.e. they both have emerged from direct derivations involving MESO-measurements and meso-measurements respectively) then  the Chapman-Enskog type derivation of (\\ref{Gdyn}) from (\\ref{Fdyn}) brings an additional information.  First, the domain of applicability of (\\ref{Gdyn}) inside of the domain of applicability of (\\ref{Fdyn}) is identified, and second,  mapping $\\xi \\mapsto \\zeta$ emerges (i.e. the material parameters $\\zeta$ with which individual features of the systems under consideration are expressed  on the meso-level become functions of the material parameters $\\xi$ used for the same purpose on the MESO-level). We shall make additional comments about the Chapman-Enskog method in Section \\ref{thCE}.\n\n\n\nExamples of applications of the Chapman-Enskog method in many types of mesoscopic dynamics (including for instance the dynamics describing chemical reactions) can be found in \\cite{Gorbbook}, \\cite{GKHilb}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Reducing  dynamics; Thermodynamics }\\label{T}\n\n\n\nMore details of the behavior\nof the macroscopic systems under consideration are seen on the MESO-level (represented by (\\ref{Fdyn}) ) than on the meso-level.\nIn the pattern recognition process involved in the passage MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso  we, first of all,  recover   the less detailed viewpoint expressed in (\\ref{Gdyn}) (that arises in the pattern recognition process as the reduced dynamics). Is there anything else that the pattern recognition process transfers from the MESO-level to   the meso-level? In this section we shall argue that the answer is affirmative. The additional information on the meso-level, that   comes from investigating  the reducing dynamics, is in its essence thermodynamics.\nIn order to be able to justify the use of the term \"thermodynamics\"   we begin by recalling  the standard (i.e. Gibbs) formulation of the classical thermodynamics and show subsequently  that   the reducing dynamics is indeed its natural extension.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Equilibrium thermodynamics}\\label{ET}\n\nThe point of departure of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics is the postulate (\\textit{\\textbf{Equilibrium Postulate 0}}) of the \\textit{existence of equilibrium states}. For example,  Callen formulates \\cite{Callen} it as follows: [\\textit{\"... in all systems there is a tendency to evolve toward states in which the properties are determined by intrinsic factors and not by previously applied external influences. Such simple terminal states are, by definition, time independent. They are called equilibrium states...\"}]. The level of description on which  investigations  are limited only to macroscopic systems  at equilibrium states will be called \\textit{equilibrium-level}. No time evolution takes place on this level.\n\n\n\nThe next postulate (\\textit{\\textbf{Equilibrium Postulate I}}) addresses the \\textit{state variables} used on the equilibrium-level to characterize  the equilibrium states. They  are the state variables needed to formulate overall macroscopic mechanics (the number of moles $N$,  the volume $V$, and the macroscopic mechanical kinetic energy $E_{mech}$)  and in addition the internal energy $E_{int}$ that is a new, extra mechanical quantity,  serving  as an independent state variable. The internal energy $E_{int}$ then combines with the macroscopic mechanical $E_{mech}$ to define the\noverall total  energy   $E=E_{mech}+E_{int}$. We shall denote the state variables of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics by the symbol $y_{eq}$  (i.e. $y_{eq}=(E,N,V)$) an the equilibrium state space $N_{eq}$ (i.e. $y_{eq}\\in N_{eq}$).\n\n\nThe third postulate (\\textit{\\textbf{Equilibrium Postulate II}}) addresses the way the equilibrium states are reached. \\textit{The equilibrium states are the states at which the entropy reaches its maximum allowed by constraints - the so called MaxEnt principle}.\nThe entropy  is a real valued function  of the equilibrium state variables (the function $S=S(E,V,N)$ is called a fundamental thermodynamic relation) that is required to satisfy certain properties. It is in the fundamental thermodynamic relation $S=S(E,V,N)$ where the individual nature of the macroscopic systems under consideration is expressed. The association between the fundamental thermodynamic relations and the macroscopic systems can be obtained, if we remain inside the level of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics, only by experimental observations (presented in the so called thermodynamic tables).  The maximization of the entropy at equilibrium sates  brings into importance the derivatives of $S$ with respect to $(E,V,N)$. They  are called conjugate state variables and are denoted $(E^*,V^*,N^*)$. In the classical equilibrium thermodynamics they have particular names,  namely,  $E^*=S_E=\\frac{1}{T}, N^*=S_N=-\\frac{\\mu}{T}, V^*=S_V=-\\frac{P}{T}$, where $T$ is the temperature, $\\mu$ the chemical potential, and $P$ the pressure. We use hereafter the notation: $S_E=\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial E}$,... .  The fundamental thermodynamic relation $S=S(E,V,N)$ transforms, under the  Legendre transformation, into its conjugate form $S^*=S^*(\\mu,T)$. As a direct consequence of one of the properties required from $S=S(E,V,N)$, namely the homogeneity $\\lambda S=S(\\lambda E,\\lambda V,\\lambda N)$, where $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $S^*=-\\frac{P}{VT}$.\n\n\nWe note that the MaxEnt principle in the classical equilibrium thermodynamics does not address the time evolution leading to the equilibrium states (i.e. it does not address the process of preparing macroscopic systems to equilibrium thermodynamic observations). It addresses only the question of what is the final result of such time evolution.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{MICRO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium; Gibbs equilibrium statistical mechanics }\\label{GET}\n\n\nAnother part of the classical equilibrium theory  is the Gibbs equilibrium statistical mechanics that investigates the passage  $MICRO \\rightarrow equilibrium$. We shall formulate the physical basis of the Gibbs theory again in three postulates.\n\n\nThe first postulate, Postulate 0,  is the same as in the classical equilibrium thermodynamics except that we include in it also the statement that the MICRO-level is well established.\n\n\n\nThe second postulate, \\textit{\\textbf{MICRO$\\rightarrow$ equilibrium Postulate I}}, addresses   the state variables on the MICRO-level and two potentials, namely the number of moles $N$ and the energy $E$. \\textit{The state variables on MICRO-level\nare position vectors ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}=({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}_1,...,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}_N)$ and momenta ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}=({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,...,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_N)$ of $N$ particles, $N\\sim 10^{23}$, (or alternatively the $N$-particle distribution function $f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$). The potentials are $N(f)=\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ (i.e. the normalization of the distribution function), and $E(f)=\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} E^{(MICRO)}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}) f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$, where $E^{(MICRO)}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ is the mechanical energy of the $N$ particles under consideration}.\n\n\n\nNext, we proceed to the third postulate that addresses the time evolution.  Since the reduced time evolution in the passage MICRO$\\rightarrow$ equilibrium is no time evolution,  the time evolution taking place on the MICRO-level is the reducing time evolution. The MICRO-level time evolution $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_0\\mapsto({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_t$ is governed by Hamilton's equations $\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\dot{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}}\\\\ \\dot{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}\\end{array}\\right)=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\\\-1&0\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}E^{(MICRO)}_{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}}\\\\E^{(MICRO)}_{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}\\end{array}\\right)$, where $E^{(MICRO)}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ is the microscopic energy. This microscopic time evolution induces the time evolution $f_0({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})\\mapsto f_t({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})=f_0(({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_{-t})$. In the third postulate,\n\\textit{\\textbf{MICRO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium Postulate II}}, the only thing that is retained in the Gibbs theory from the reducing microscopic dynamics can be summed up in the following three points:\n\n(i)  \\textit{The number of particles $N(f)$ and the energy $E(f)$ are conserved during the time evolution}.\n\n\n\n(ii) \\textit{Particle trajectories $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_0\\mapsto({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})_t$ fill up the microscopic phase space $M^{(MICRO)}$ (i.e. $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})\\in M^{(MICRO)}$)  so that time averages can be replaced with  averages (by using certain measures)  in  $M^{(MICRO)}$ (\\textit{the ergodic hypothesis})}.\n\n\n\n\n(iii)  \\textit{Equilibrium states are defined as states at which the entropy  $S(f)$  reaches its maximum allowed by constraints (i.e. MaxEnt principle for  the MICRO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium passage).

First, it brings a microscopic insight into the meaning of the internal energy. In the context of the MICRO-level it is the energy of the particles modulo the overall mechanical energy. The mechanical  origin of the internal energy  implies then  the mechanical nature of the heat and consequently the conservation law involved in Equilibrium Postulate II. Second, the Gibbs equilibrium statistical mechanics provides a mapping between the particle energy $E^{(MICRO)}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ (i.e. the quantity through which the individual nature of macroscopic systems is expressed  on MICRO-level) and the equilibrium  fundamental thermodynamic relation (i.e. the quantity through which the individual nature of macroscopic systems is expressed on  equilibrium-level).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Thermodynamics}\\label{Thermod}\n\n\n\nSo far, we have considered only the ultimate microscopic level (called MICRO-level) and the ultimate macroscopic level (called equilibrium-level).

We modify it by noting that\nthe equilibrium-level is not the only well established level that is less microscopic than the MICRO-level.  There is in fact a whole family of such levels (for example fluid mechanics and kinetic theory levels).

We consider externally driven macroscopic systems whose time evolution is described on both MESO and meso levels and we  investigate the passage MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso.

The construction  proceeds as follows. If we switch  off in (\\ref{Gdyn}) the external forces (i.e. if we put $\\Omega^{meso}=0$ in (\\ref{Gdyn})) then (\\ref{Gdyn}) possesses the GENERIC structure (\\ref{GENERIC}) and we recognize there the thermodynamic forces $X$, thermodynamic fluxes $J$ and the dissipation potential $\\Xi(X)$ (see (\\ref{Xi})) relating them ($J=\\Xi_X$).

The physical systems considered there are not prevented to reach equilibrium states and are thus externally unforced.  On the other hand, in our extension we put into focus the reducing time evolution, namely  the time evolution  bringing the fluxes $J$ to the constitutive relations $J^{CR}$. The equilibrium level is not, due to the presence of external forces, accessible. If the external forces are switched off  then the approach $MESO\\, \\rightarrow\\, equilibrium $ exists and is governed by (\\ref{GENERIC}). This means, in particular, that the inequality (\\ref{asGEN}) holds (i.e. the entropy $S(x)$ does not decrease). If however the external forces are switched on then the inequality   (\\ref{asGEN}) does not (at least in general) hold. The entropy $S(x)$ can decrease. If we interpret $S(x)$ as a measure of disorder then this statement is clearly understandable since there are many examples (one of them is the Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard system) in which well organized patterns are emerging  in the meso time evolution of externally driven systems. The organization thus increases  in the mesoscopic time evolution and consequently the entropy decreases.  But even if this happens  the approach $MESO\\, \\rightarrow\\, meso $ still exists (since both Meso and meso levels have been found to be well established) and it is this approach that will give us potentials that play essentially the same role as  the energy and the  entropy play in the investigation of the $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\, equilibrium$ passage (see  Section \\ref{MeqGEN}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we turn  to the reducing time evolution (\\ref{crev}) bringing  $J$  to $J^{CR}$.\nIn view of (\\ref{Gflux}), (\\ref{crel}),\nwe  regard  it as the reducing time evolution  MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso. Since the time evolution making  the passage   $MESO\\, \\rightarrow\\, equilibrium $ is also reducing  we shall be inspired in the investigation of the passage MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso by the analysis that we presented in Section \\ref{MeqGEN} but we shall be conscious of the differences.  In order to emphasize the difference in the physics   and also in order to keep as much as possible the traditional notation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we shall  slightly modify the notation  used in Section \\ref{MeqGEN}. First, we denote the state variables by the symbol $J$ to emphasize their physical interpretation as fluxes.  In the classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the thermodynamic dissipative fluxes are indeed denoted traditionally by the symbol $J$.\nTheir conjugates, having the physical interpretation of thermodynamic forces, will  be denoted, again in order to respect the traditional notation,  by the symbol  $X$  (had we follow the notation used in the previous sections, we would denote conjugate of $J$ by the symbol $J^*$). As for the other terms and the other terminology that we have introduced\nin Section \\ref{MeqGEN}, we shall use it also in the analysis of the MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso passage  but we put  \"CR\" in front of all the terms. We thus investigate\nCR time evolution in which  CR-entropy, CR-energy and other CR-terms arise.  By CR, which means \"constitutive relation\", we emphasize that we are dealing with the time evolution leading to constitutive relations. The particularity  of this time evolution\nis well displayed  in (\\ref{Gflux}). We see in (\\ref{Gflux}) that we can pass  from $J$ to\n$\\mathcal{G}(y,J,\\zeta)$ (we consider $y$ as a fixed parameter) which is an element of vector fields on $M$ (i.e. an element of mappings $M\\rightarrow TM$, where $TM$ is the tangent bundle associated with the state space $M$). We shall use the symbol  $\\mathfrak{M}$ to denote the space of vector fields on $M$. The time evolution of the fluxes $J$  can be thus lifted with the mapping $\\mathcal{G}$ (in which $y$ is considered to be a fixed parameter)  to the time evolution in the space $\\mathfrak{M}$. The required property $J\\rightarrow J^{CR}$ as $t\\rightarrow \\infty$ thus means that the time evolution (\\ref{crev}) is making reduction $\\mathfrak{M}\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{N}$, where $\\mathfrak{N}$ is the space of vector fields on the meso-level. The important difference between (\\ref{GENERIC}) and (\\ref{crev}) is that the former\ngenerates the time evolution making the reduction $M\\rightarrow N_{eq}$ and the latter the time evolution making the reduction $\\mathfrak{M}\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{N}$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recall that in Section  \\ref{MeqGEN} we have began the discussion of the reducing time evolution by introducing a potential $\\Phi$ (see (\\ref{Phi1})) that reaches its minimum at the state (denoted $x_{eq}$ and called an equilibrium sate)  reached as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$.

But even if this happens  the approach $MESO\\, \\rightarrow\\, meso $ still exists (since both Meso and meso levels have been found to be well established) and it is this approach that will give us potentials that play essentially the same role as  the energy and the  entropy play in the investigation of the $MESO\\,\\rightarrow\\, equilibrium$ passage (see  Section \\ref{MeqGEN}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we turn  to the reducing time evolution (\\ref{crev}) bringing  $J$  to $J^{CR}$.\nIn view of (\\ref{Gflux}), (\\ref{crel}),\nwe  regard  it as the reducing time evolution  MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso. Since the time evolution making  the passage   $MESO\\, \\rightarrow\\, equilibrium $ is also reducing  we shall be inspired in the investigation of the passage MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso by the analysis that we presented in Section \\ref{MeqGEN} but we shall be conscious of the differences.  In order to emphasize the difference in the physics   and also in order to keep as much as possible the traditional notation of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we shall  slightly modify the notation  used in Section \\ref{MeqGEN}. First, we denote the state variables by the symbol $J$ to emphasize their physical interpretation as fluxes.  In the classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics, the thermodynamic dissipative fluxes are indeed denoted traditionally by the symbol $J$.\nTheir conjugates, having the physical interpretation of thermodynamic forces, will  be denoted, again in order to respect the traditional notation,  by the symbol  $X$  (had we follow the notation used in the previous sections, we would denote conjugate of $J$ by the symbol $J^*$). As for the other terms and the other terminology that we have introduced\nin Section \\ref{MeqGEN}, we shall use it also in the analysis of the MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso passage  but we put  \"CR\" in front of all the terms. We thus investigate\nCR time evolution in which  CR-entropy, CR-energy and other CR-terms arise.  By CR, which means \"constitutive relation\", we emphasize that we are dealing with the time evolution leading to constitutive relations. The particularity  of this time evolution\nis well displayed  in (\\ref{Gflux}). We see in (\\ref{Gflux}) that we can pass  from $J$ to\n$\\mathcal{G}(y,J,\\zeta)$ (we consider $y$ as a fixed parameter) which is an element of vector fields on $M$ (i.e. an element of mappings $M\\rightarrow TM$, where $TM$ is the tangent bundle associated with the state space $M$). We shall use the symbol  $\\mathfrak{M}$ to denote the space of vector fields on $M$. The time evolution of the fluxes $J$  can be thus lifted with the mapping $\\mathcal{G}$ (in which $y$ is considered to be a fixed parameter)  to the time evolution in the space $\\mathfrak{M}$. The required property $J\\rightarrow J^{CR}$ as $t\\rightarrow \\infty$ thus means that the time evolution (\\ref{crev}) is making reduction $\\mathfrak{M}\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{N}$, where $\\mathfrak{N}$ is the space of vector fields on the meso-level. The important difference between (\\ref{GENERIC}) and (\\ref{crev}) is that the former\ngenerates the time evolution making the reduction $M\\rightarrow N_{eq}$ and the latter the time evolution making the reduction $\\mathfrak{M}\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{N}$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recall that in Section  \\ref{MeqGEN} we have began the discussion of the reducing time evolution by introducing a potential $\\Phi$ (see (\\ref{Phi1})) that reaches its minimum at the state (denoted $x_{eq}$ and called an equilibrium sate)  reached as $t\\rightarrow\\infty$. In the context of the $MESO\\, \\rightarrow\\, meso $ passage the potential playing the same role is\n\n", "index": 27, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{Psi}\n\\Psi(J,y^*)=-\\Theta(J)+E^*_{meso} \\Theta^{mech}(J) +X^{CR}(y^*)J\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E14.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Psi(J,y^{*})=-\\Theta(J)+E^{*}_{meso}\\Theta^{mech}(J)+X^{CR}(y^{*})J\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a8</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>J</mi><mo>,</mo><msup><mi>y</mi><mo>*</mo></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0398</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi></mrow><mo>*</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0398</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>J</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mi>X</mi><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi>y</mi><mo>*</mo></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>J</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07151.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\n\n\nThe symbols appearing in (\\ref{Psi}) have the following meaning.

Examples of reciprocity relations that arise in chemical kinetics are worked out  in Section III B in \\cite{GrmPavKlika}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{CR Thermodynamic potential $\\Psi$}\\label{CRE}\n\n\n\n\nWe ask now the following question. Given an externally driven macroscopic system, how do we find the CR thermodynamical potential $\\Psi$ (see (\\ref{Psi}))  corresponding to it? If we ask the same question, but with externally unforced macroscopic systems and with the thermodynamic potential $\\Phi$ (see (\\ref{Phi}) ) replacing  externally driven macroscopic systems and  the   CR thermodynamic potential $\\Psi$, then the answer is the following. On the most macroscopic level (that is for externally unforced systems the level of classical equilibrium thermodynamics - see Section \\ref{ET}), the only way we can identify the thermodynamic potential $\\Phi$ is by making experimental observations (e.g. observation of the relation among $P,V,T$ and of the specific heat - see Section \\ref{ET}). The knowledge of $\\Phi$ on the level of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics can be then transferred, via the local equilibrium assumption, also to\nthe level of fluid mechanics.  On the level of kinetic theory,  we can take as the point of departure for the search of $\\Phi$ the Boltzmann kinetic equation (playing the role of (\\ref{Gdyn})) and arrive (following Boltzmann) to the Boltzmann entropy by investigating properties of its solutions.\nOn the MICRO-level, it suffices to know all the mechanical interactions expressed in the energy $E^{MICRO}$ since the entropy on the MICRO-level is the universal Gibbs entropy (\\ref{microftr}). On meso-levels, we may find $\\Phi$ by MaxEnt reduction from the MICRO-level (i.e. by maximizing the Gibbs entropy subjected to constraints expressing the mapping  from MICRO to meso state spaces) and/or by relating  entropy to concepts arising in the information theory and the theory of probability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most macroscopic level on which externally driven macroscopic systems can be described is the level of fluid mechanics. On this level the potential $\\Theta $ has (up to a multiplicative constant) physical interpretation of the entropy production and $\\Theta^{mech}$ (again up to a multiplicative constant ) of the work per unit time done by external forces. We now prove this statement. If the forces $X$ and $X^{mech}$ are not too large, the potentials $\\Xi$ and $\\Xi^{mech}$ can be well approximated by a quadratic potential\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{XX}\n\\Xi(X)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda <X,X>\\nonumber \\\\\n\\Xi^{mech}(X^{mech})&=&\\Lambda^{mech}<X^{mech},X^{mech}>,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Lambda>0, \\Lambda^{mech}>0$ are material parameters. For these potentials then\n$J=\\Xi_{X}=\\Lambda X$ and $\\Theta(J)=[-\\Xi(X)+JX]_{X=\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}J}=\\frac{1}{2\\Lambda}<J,J>$. From (\\ref{asGEN}) we know that the entropy production $\\Sigma=\\alpha<X,J>_{X=X^{CR}}$ which then means that we can regard $2\\alpha\\Xi$ as entropy production. It has been suggested in \\cite{Beretta} to regard $\\Lambda$ as a metric tensor. This interpretation brings then Riemannian geometry to dissipative dynamics. We emphasize that this geometrical viewpoint is limited to the quadratic dissipation potential. In the case of nonlinear dissipation potentials (for example those arising below in this section), the geometrical interpretation is still possible but the classical Riemannian geometry has to be replaced by a more general geometry.  On the level of fluid mechanics the dissipation potential (\\ref{XX}) can be made explicit if the local equilibrium assumption and the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier constitutive relations are   used.  In the case of mechanical driving forces $X^{mech}$ the work per unit time replaces the entropy production. We shall use this specification of the CR-potential $\\Psi$ in the illustration worked out in Section \\ref{thimbl}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now turn to the MICRO-level. We know that on this level there is a universal entropy (namely the Gibbs entropy (\\ref{microftr})), from which, via  MaxEnt, we can then also derive entropies on meso-levels. Is there also a universal CR-entropy on the MICRO-level? We now investigate this question.\nWe look for a dissipation potential $\\Xi^{(N)}$  which brings N-particle distribution functions $f_N(1,...,N)$ to the  Gibbs distribution $(f_N)_{eq}$ (i.e. to $f_N$ for which the thermodynamic potential $\\Phi$ given in (\\ref{Phi}) reaches its minimum).

On this level the potential $\\Theta $ has (up to a multiplicative constant) physical interpretation of the entropy production and $\\Theta^{mech}$ (again up to a multiplicative constant ) of the work per unit time done by external forces. We now prove this statement. If the forces $X$ and $X^{mech}$ are not too large, the potentials $\\Xi$ and $\\Xi^{mech}$ can be well approximated by a quadratic potential\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{XX}\n\\Xi(X)&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda <X,X>\\nonumber \\\\\n\\Xi^{mech}(X^{mech})&=&\\Lambda^{mech}<X^{mech},X^{mech}>,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Lambda>0, \\Lambda^{mech}>0$ are material parameters. For these potentials then\n$J=\\Xi_{X}=\\Lambda X$ and $\\Theta(J)=[-\\Xi(X)+JX]_{X=\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}J}=\\frac{1}{2\\Lambda}<J,J>$. From (\\ref{asGEN}) we know that the entropy production $\\Sigma=\\alpha<X,J>_{X=X^{CR}}$ which then means that we can regard $2\\alpha\\Xi$ as entropy production. It has been suggested in \\cite{Beretta} to regard $\\Lambda$ as a metric tensor. This interpretation brings then Riemannian geometry to dissipative dynamics. We emphasize that this geometrical viewpoint is limited to the quadratic dissipation potential. In the case of nonlinear dissipation potentials (for example those arising below in this section), the geometrical interpretation is still possible but the classical Riemannian geometry has to be replaced by a more general geometry.  On the level of fluid mechanics the dissipation potential (\\ref{XX}) can be made explicit if the local equilibrium assumption and the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier constitutive relations are   used.  In the case of mechanical driving forces $X^{mech}$ the work per unit time replaces the entropy production. We shall use this specification of the CR-potential $\\Psi$ in the illustration worked out in Section \\ref{thimbl}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now turn to the MICRO-level. We know that on this level there is a universal entropy (namely the Gibbs entropy (\\ref{microftr})), from which, via  MaxEnt, we can then also derive entropies on meso-levels. Is there also a universal CR-entropy on the MICRO-level? We now investigate this question.\nWe look for a dissipation potential $\\Xi^{(N)}$  which brings N-particle distribution functions $f_N(1,...,N)$ to the  Gibbs distribution $(f_N)_{eq}$ (i.e. to $f_N$ for which the thermodynamic potential $\\Phi$ given in (\\ref{Phi}) reaches its minimum).

As for the investigation of the MESO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium passage in externally unforced systems (see Section \\ref{MeqGEN}), many applications (in particular in the context of complex fluids) can be found in \\cite{Grmadv},\\cite{Obook}.\n\n\nBefore proceeding to  illustrations,   we would like to emphasize  that the principal objective  of thermodynamics is to investigate   relations among microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic theories of macroscopic  systems. Thermodynamics is thus, by its nature,   a very abstract theory. It is in fact  a theory of theories or, in other words,  a metaphysics. At the same time,  the classical thermodynamics is very pertinent in engineering applications and in this sense it is a very concrete and a very  practically oriented theory. In particular, we recall that the initial motivation for creating thermodynamics was to understand working of   thermal machines and to increase their efficiency. The very wide scope of thermodynamics is certainly one of the reasons for its attractiveness but it is also a reason    (at least one of the reasons) for unusually strong disagreements among its practitioners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Externally imposed temperature}\\label{realiz}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe external force in this example is the energy exchange with  thermal bath that is kept at a constant temperature $\\mathfrak{T}$. In this case the externally driven macroscopic system evolves to an equilibrium state. This means that in this investigation of the  MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso  passage the meso levels is the  equilibrium level. The difference between the MESO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium passage investigated in Section \\ref{MeqGEN} and  the  MESO $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium passage investigated in this example is that the state variables $y_{eq}$ at the equilibrium level are not $(E,V,N)$  (as in Section \\ref{ET}) but $(E^*,V,N)$, where $E^*=S_E=\\frac{1}{T}$ is the conjugate of $E$.\n\n\n\nThe CR thermodynamic potential $\\Psi$ driving the  evolution is, in this example, the thermodynamic potential (\\ref{Phi1}) with $T=\\mathfrak{T}$, i.e. $\\Phi(x,\\mathfrak{T},\\mu)=-S(E,V,N)+\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}}E-\\frac{\\mu}{\\mathfrak{T}}N$. The CR-GENERIC equation (\\ref{CRGEN}) is, in this example,  the GENERIC time evolution (\\ref{GENERIC}) with $T=\\mathfrak{T}$ and with the degeneracies of $L$ and $\\Xi$ that guarantee the mass conservation (\\ref{consNGEN}) but not the energy conservation (\\ref{consEGEN}).  The resulting fundamental thermodynamic relation is the Legendre transformation $(E,N,V)\\rightarrow(\\frac{1}{T},N,V)$ of the fundamental thermodynamic relation $S=S(E,V,N)$ implied by the GENERIC reducing time evolution discussed in Section \\ref{MeqGEN}.\n\n\nThe above analysis becomes particularly interesting if we choose the MESO-level to be the equilibrium level with state variables $(E,V,N)$. In this case of MESO $\\rightarrow$ passage both MESO and meso levels are equilibrium levels. They differ only in state variables: on MESO level the state variables are $(E,N,V)$ and on meso-level $(E^*,V,N)$\nThe reducing time evolution in this equilibrium $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium passage is the  time evolution making the Legendre transformation  $(E,N,V)\\rightarrow(\\frac{1}{T},N,V)$.

The most macroscopic level (i.e. the level with least details) on which macroscopic systems subjected to  temperature gradient can be described is the level of fluid mechanics (we shall call it hereafter FM-level) on which the state variables are: $x=(\\rho({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}),{\\boldmath \\mbox{$u$}}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}),e({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}))$, where ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}$ is the position vector, $\\rho({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}})$ is the mass field (mass per unit volume at ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}$), ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$u$}}({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}})$ is the momentum field, and $e({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}})$ the energy field. In this example we shall limit ourselves only to the state variable $e({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}})$. All other state variables are assumed to be already at equilibrium. In this setting we now  investigate the passage MESO $\\rightarrow$ FM.\n\nFirst, we recall that in the  absence of the  imposed temperature gradient (i.e. if $(\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}})=0$, the macroscopic systems under consideration will approach to the equilibrium level and we can therefore consider the level of fluid mechanics (called FM-level) as MESO-level and investigate  the passage FM $\\rightarrow$ equilibrium.

We have illustrated it there on the passage from the Boltzmann kinetic equation to fluid mechanics. In this section we make two additional comments. First, we show how  the Boltzmann (and other) kinetic equations can emerge from the pattern recognition process. Second, we show how the CR-thermodynamics corresponding to the  passage from kinetic theory to fluid mechanics is related to the Chapman-Enskog method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime evolution equations provide only  vector fields. Phase portrait is a collection of trajectories obtained by solving the time evolution equation (i.e. by following the orders given by the vectors in the vector fields). In order to be able to recognize patterns in phase portraits we have to know therefore the trajectories or at least to have some pertinent information about them. In this section we shall begin with Hamilton's dynamics of $N$ particles and attempt to arrive at the Boltzmann and similar  kinetic equations by recognizing  patterns in particle trajectories.\n\n\n\nWe begin with a macroscopic system  composed of particles that do not interact except for occasional binary collisions.  From the physical point of view, such macroscopic system is  a dilute gas composed of  noninteracting particles.  Two dominant features of particle trajectories are noted: (i) straight line (representing free motion of particles), and (ii) two intersecting lines (representing binary collisions). We choose  one particle distribution function $f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ as variable with which we shall characterize states of the gas and try to express these two features in the vector field generating its time evolution.\n\n\nWe begin with the  straight line  ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\rightarrow {\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}+\\frac{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}{m}t$.  We can see this line  as a trajectory generated by $\\dot{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}}=\\frac{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}{m}$ and $\\dot{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}=0$. By $m$ we denote the mass of one particle and $t$ denotes the time. This particle time evolution induces  the time evolution $f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})\\rightarrow f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}-\\frac{{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}}{m}t,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ in  one particle distribution functions. This time evolution is then  generated by the vector field (\\ref{ffl}). We have thus arrived at the vector field representing the first feature of particle trajectories.\n\nWe turn now to the second feature, i.e. to two intersecting lines representing binary collisions.\nFormally, we regarded this feature as  two straight lines, corresponding to momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_2)$,  meeting at the position with coordinate ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}_1$ and continuing as two straight lines corresponding to momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_2)$.  The ingoing momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_2)$ and the outgoing momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_2)$ are related by the relations (\\ref{conBE}) expressing the mechanics of the collision. More details about the collision mechanics  (that would  make the relation between the ingoing and outgoing momenta one-to-one) are not a part of   the second feature.  In terms of one particle distribution functions we express it therefore as the time evolution generated by  gain-loss balance, or in other words, by considering $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_2)\\leftrightarrow({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_2)$ as a chemical reaction obeying  the constraint (\\ref{conBE}). As we have seen in Section \\ref{CRE}, the vector field  generating such gain-loss balance is given by (\\ref{intlin}).\n\nBoth features of the particle phase portrait are thus expressed in the time evolution of one particle distribution functions as the sum of the vector fields (\\ref{ffl}) and (\\ref{intlin}). The kinetic equation that we are obtaining in this way    is the Boltzmann kinetic equation. The nonclassical formulation in which the Boltzmann equation is emerging  from our derivation\nhas several advantages. One of them is that the H-theorem (i.e. $\\dot{S}\\geq 0$) is in it  manifestly visible. Another advantage  is that we have in fact derived  a generalization of the Boltzmann equation since we do not have to choose $S(f)=-k_B\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}) \\ln f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$.  The entropy  $S(f)$ can be a more general potential $\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} c(f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}))$, where $c$  is an unspecified but sufficiently regular concave function $\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$. With such more general entropy $S(f)$ we  still have the H-theorem  $\\dot{S}\\geq 0$ since, as we convince ourselves by a direct verification,  the time evolution generated by (\\ref{ffl}) does not change $S(f)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now turn our attention to the  passage $kinetic\\,\\,theory\\rightarrow fluid\\,\\,mechanics$. We have seen in Section \\ref{D} that the\npattern of principal importance in the Chapman-Enskog method addressing this passage  is the submanifold $\\mathcal{M}_0$. In the classical viewpoint of the Chapman-Enskog method (recalled in Section \\ref{D}) this submanifold is recognized by splitting the vector field $G$ into two parts: the dominant part $G_0$ and the remaining part $G_1$. The submanifold $\\mathcal{M}_0$ is then the manifold on which the dominant part $G_0$   disappears. There is no thermodynamics in this classical viewpoint. Another observation that  we can make about the classical Chapman-Enskog method is that it generates more\ninformation about solutions of the Boltzmann equation than the information that appears at the end in the reduced dynamics. For example, the geometry of the submanifolds $\\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\\mathcal{M}_1$ is not seen in  the reduced dynamics. Such additional knowledge  makes its  appearance in the reducing dynamics and in the associated with it thermodynamics.\n\n\n\nThe first step that brings  thermodynamics  to the Chapman-Enskog method is made by   taking into account  Boltzmann's H-theorem. This theorem  provides another path leading to the recognition of $\\mathcal{M}_0$ and to the recognition of the importance that it  plays in the passage $kinetic\\,\\,theory\\rightarrow fluid\\,\\,mechanics$. According to Botzmann's H-theorem,  the potential  \\\\$S(f)=-k_B\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})\\ln f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ reaches in the time evolution its maximum. The manifold on which $S(f)$ reaches its maximum subjected to constraints representing the fluid mechanics fields expressed in terms of the one particle distribution function  is exactly the submanifold $\\mathcal{M}_0$. If we interpret the potential $S(f)$ as entropy, we see that the second step in the Chapman-Enskog method becomes a part of  the thermodynamic reduction. This thermodynamic formulation of the second step in the Chapman-Enskog method is systematically used for example in \\cite{Gorbbook}.\n\n\n\n\nCan we follow this path and interpret thermodynamically also the third step in the Chapman-Enskog method (i.e. the deformation of $\\mathcal{M}_0$ to $\\mathcal{M}_1$)? In order to make such interpretation, we  look for a potential $S_1(f)$, that satisfies the following properties: (i) $S_1(f)$ is a deformation of $S(f)$, (ii) its maximum is reached at $\\mathcal{M}_1$, and (iii) it generates the time evolution in which  $\\mathcal{M}_1$ is approached (similarly as $S(f)$ generates the time evolution  $\\mathcal{M}_0$ is approached. The partial results related to  this problem that are reported in Section 4.2 of \\cite{Grmadv} indicate that the potential obtained in this way is indeed the CR-entropy generating the reducing time evolution that is  involved in the passage from kinetic theory to fluid mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Thermodynamics of immiscible blends; phase inversion}\\label{thimbl}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we  apply  CR-thermodynamics to immiscible blends. We recall that    extension of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics of  single component macroscopic systems to multicomponent miscible blends  led Gibbs  to the   completion of the mathematical  formulation of  equilibrium thermodynamics. Further extension to immiscible blends requires to leave the realm of  equilibrium thermodynamics and to enter CR-thermodynamics. Immiscible blends do not reach  equilibrium states. Extra  variables addressing  morphology of the interfaces among the components are needed to characterize their states. The external forces are imposed flows arising in the mixing process. We shall not attempt in this paper to make a systematic investigation of CR-thermodynamics of immiscible blends. We shall concentrate only on one particular problem and use thermodynamics to investigate  it.\n\n\n\nThe immiscible blend that we consider is composed of two immiscible fluids (component \"1\", and component \"2\").\nThe problem that we investigate is phase inversion.  Let initially the component \"1\" form  a continuous phase in which the component \"2\" is dispersed. This means that the component \"2\" resides inside drops encircled completely by the component \"1\". Every two points in the component \"1\" can be joined by a line that lies completely inside the component \"1\". We shall now increase the amount of the component \"2\". We anticipate that at some volume fraction $\\phi_2$ of the second component the roles of the two components change, the second component becomes the  continuous phase and the first component becomes the dispersed phase. At the critical state at which the change occurs both components form a continuous phase. The morphology at the critical state is called a co-continuous  morphology. The problem that we want to investigate is to estimate the critical value of $\\phi_2$ as a function of the properties of the components (as for instance the viscosity, elasticity etc.) and of the blending conditions (i.e. the externally imposed forces). The co-continuous morphology is in particular very important in applications involving blends of polymer melts (see e.g. \\cite{Favis}).\n\nIn order to have a specific example in mind, we may think of  immiscible blends of oil and water. If water is the continuous phase then the blend is milk, if oil is the continuous phase then the blend is butter.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to approach the problem of phase inversion is by attempting to formulate a dynamical model of immiscible blends.\nIn this paper we  shall not take this route. We shall turn to thermodynamics.   The concept with which we begin is the CR thermodynamic potential (\\ref{Psi}). Next, we  regard phase inversion as phase transition. In view of the  comment that we made at the end of Section \\ref{SCRGEN}, this means that at the point of phase inversion\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 85471, "prevtext": "\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation on the FM-level implied by the MESO-level CR-GENERIC equation (\\ref{delt}) is\n\n", "index": 59, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{frFM}\n\\Theta^{FM}(e({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}});(\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}}))=\\left[\\Psi(J^{(h)}; (\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}}))\\right]_{\\Theta_{J^{(h)}_i}=(\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}})_i}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E30.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Theta^{FM}(e({\\boldmath\\mbox{$r$}});(\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}}))=\\left[%&#10;\\Psi(J^{(h)};(\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}}))\\right]_{\\Theta_{J^{(h)}_{i}}=(%&#10;\\nabla\\frac{1}{\\mathfrak{T}})_{i}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0398</mi><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc93</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>;</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>\u2207</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>\ud835\udd17</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a8</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi>J</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>h</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msup><mo>;</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>\u2207</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>\ud835\udd17</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0398</mi><msubsup><mi>J</mi><mi>i</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>h</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>\u2207</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>\ud835\udd17</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></msub></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07151.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere\n$\\Psi_{i/k}$ is the CR thermodynamic potential when the component \"i\" forms the continuous phase and the component \"k\" the disperse phase.

We have thus arrived at the vector field representing the first feature of particle trajectories.\n\nWe turn now to the second feature, i.e. to two intersecting lines representing binary collisions.\nFormally, we regarded this feature as  two straight lines, corresponding to momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_2)$,  meeting at the position with coordinate ${\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}_1$ and continuing as two straight lines corresponding to momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_2)$.  The ingoing momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_2)$ and the outgoing momenta $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_2)$ are related by the relations (\\ref{conBE}) expressing the mechanics of the collision. More details about the collision mechanics  (that would  make the relation between the ingoing and outgoing momenta one-to-one) are not a part of   the second feature.  In terms of one particle distribution functions we express it therefore as the time evolution generated by  gain-loss balance, or in other words, by considering $({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}'_2)\\leftrightarrow({\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_1,{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}_2)$ as a chemical reaction obeying  the constraint (\\ref{conBE}). As we have seen in Section \\ref{CRE}, the vector field  generating such gain-loss balance is given by (\\ref{intlin}).\n\nBoth features of the particle phase portrait are thus expressed in the time evolution of one particle distribution functions as the sum of the vector fields (\\ref{ffl}) and (\\ref{intlin}). The kinetic equation that we are obtaining in this way    is the Boltzmann kinetic equation. The nonclassical formulation in which the Boltzmann equation is emerging  from our derivation\nhas several advantages. One of them is that the H-theorem (i.e. $\\dot{S}\\geq 0$) is in it  manifestly visible. Another advantage  is that we have in fact derived  a generalization of the Boltzmann equation since we do not have to choose $S(f)=-k_B\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}) \\ln f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$.  The entropy  $S(f)$ can be a more general potential $\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} c(f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}}))$, where $c$  is an unspecified but sufficiently regular concave function $\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$. With such more general entropy $S(f)$ we  still have the H-theorem  $\\dot{S}\\geq 0$ since, as we convince ourselves by a direct verification,  the time evolution generated by (\\ref{ffl}) does not change $S(f)$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now turn our attention to the  passage $kinetic\\,\\,theory\\rightarrow fluid\\,\\,mechanics$. We have seen in Section \\ref{D} that the\npattern of principal importance in the Chapman-Enskog method addressing this passage  is the submanifold $\\mathcal{M}_0$. In the classical viewpoint of the Chapman-Enskog method (recalled in Section \\ref{D}) this submanifold is recognized by splitting the vector field $G$ into two parts: the dominant part $G_0$ and the remaining part $G_1$. The submanifold $\\mathcal{M}_0$ is then the manifold on which the dominant part $G_0$   disappears. There is no thermodynamics in this classical viewpoint. Another observation that  we can make about the classical Chapman-Enskog method is that it generates more\ninformation about solutions of the Boltzmann equation than the information that appears at the end in the reduced dynamics. For example, the geometry of the submanifolds $\\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\\mathcal{M}_1$ is not seen in  the reduced dynamics. Such additional knowledge  makes its  appearance in the reducing dynamics and in the associated with it thermodynamics.\n\n\n\nThe first step that brings  thermodynamics  to the Chapman-Enskog method is made by   taking into account  Boltzmann's H-theorem. This theorem  provides another path leading to the recognition of $\\mathcal{M}_0$ and to the recognition of the importance that it  plays in the passage $kinetic\\,\\,theory\\rightarrow fluid\\,\\,mechanics$. According to Botzmann's H-theorem,  the potential  \\\\$S(f)=-k_B\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}}\\int d{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}} f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})\\ln f({\\boldmath \\mbox{$r$}},{\\boldmath \\mbox{$v$}})$ reaches in the time evolution its maximum. The manifold on which $S(f)$ reaches its maximum subjected to constraints representing the fluid mechanics fields expressed in terms of the one particle distribution function  is exactly the submanifold $\\mathcal{M}_0$. If we interpret the potential $S(f)$ as entropy, we see that the second step in the Chapman-Enskog method becomes a part of  the thermodynamic reduction. This thermodynamic formulation of the second step in the Chapman-Enskog method is systematically used for example in \\cite{Gorbbook}.\n\n\n\n\nCan we follow this path and interpret thermodynamically also the third step in the Chapman-Enskog method (i.e. the deformation of $\\mathcal{M}_0$ to $\\mathcal{M}_1$)? In order to make such interpretation, we  look for a potential $S_1(f)$, that satisfies the following properties: (i) $S_1(f)$ is a deformation of $S(f)$, (ii) its maximum is reached at $\\mathcal{M}_1$, and (iii) it generates the time evolution in which  $\\mathcal{M}_1$ is approached (similarly as $S(f)$ generates the time evolution  $\\mathcal{M}_0$ is approached. The partial results related to  this problem that are reported in Section 4.2 of \\cite{Grmadv} indicate that the potential obtained in this way is indeed the CR-entropy generating the reducing time evolution that is  involved in the passage from kinetic theory to fluid mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Thermodynamics of immiscible blends; phase inversion}\\label{thimbl}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we  apply  CR-thermodynamics to immiscible blends. We recall that    extension of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics of  single component macroscopic systems to multicomponent miscible blends  led Gibbs  to the   completion of the mathematical  formulation of  equilibrium thermodynamics. Further extension to immiscible blends requires to leave the realm of  equilibrium thermodynamics and to enter CR-thermodynamics. Immiscible blends do not reach  equilibrium states. Extra  variables addressing  morphology of the interfaces among the components are needed to characterize their states. The external forces are imposed flows arising in the mixing process. We shall not attempt in this paper to make a systematic investigation of CR-thermodynamics of immiscible blends. We shall concentrate only on one particular problem and use thermodynamics to investigate  it.\n\n\n\nThe immiscible blend that we consider is composed of two immiscible fluids (component \"1\", and component \"2\").\nThe problem that we investigate is phase inversion.  Let initially the component \"1\" form  a continuous phase in which the component \"2\" is dispersed. This means that the component \"2\" resides inside drops encircled completely by the component \"1\". Every two points in the component \"1\" can be joined by a line that lies completely inside the component \"1\". We shall now increase the amount of the component \"2\". We anticipate that at some volume fraction $\\phi_2$ of the second component the roles of the two components change, the second component becomes the  continuous phase and the first component becomes the dispersed phase. At the critical state at which the change occurs both components form a continuous phase. The morphology at the critical state is called a co-continuous  morphology. The problem that we want to investigate is to estimate the critical value of $\\phi_2$ as a function of the properties of the components (as for instance the viscosity, elasticity etc.) and of the blending conditions (i.e. the externally imposed forces). The co-continuous morphology is in particular very important in applications involving blends of polymer melts (see e.g. \\cite{Favis}).\n\nIn order to have a specific example in mind, we may think of  immiscible blends of oil and water. If water is the continuous phase then the blend is milk, if oil is the continuous phase then the blend is butter.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to approach the problem of phase inversion is by attempting to formulate a dynamical model of immiscible blends.\nIn this paper we  shall not take this route. We shall turn to thermodynamics.   The concept with which we begin is the CR thermodynamic potential (\\ref{Psi}). Next, we  regard phase inversion as phase transition. In view of the  comment that we made at the end of Section \\ref{SCRGEN}, this means that at the point of phase inversion\n\n", "index": 61, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{Phinver}\n\\Psi_{1/2}=\\Psi_{2/1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E31.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Psi_{1/2}=\\Psi_{2/1}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a8</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a8</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07151.tex", "nexttext": "\nWe now consider the potential  $\\Theta$ to be simply (see the second paragraph in Section \\ref{CRE}) the entropy production, and  $W$ to be the work involved in elastic deformations of the dispersed droplets, and $T_0$ is the temperature of the blend.

By identifying the reducing dynamics with thermodynamics we have been able to formulate a general  thermodynamics that encompasses the classical equilibrium thermodynamics, the equilibrium statistical mechanics, mesoscopic thermodynamics, and thermodynamics of externally driven systems. The general thermodynamics is presented in three postulates.\n\n\n\nThe first postulate (called Postulate 0 in order to keep as much as possible the traditional terminology) states that there exist well established mesoscopic levels of description. By well established we mean well tested with experimental observations. This postulate generalizes the  postulate of the existence of the well established  equilibrium states that serves as a basis of the classical equilibrium and the Gibbs statistical equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\n\n\n\nThe second postulate (called Postulate I) is about state variables used on the MESO and meso levels and about potentials needed to formulate mechanics. Again, this postulate generalizes  the classical Postulate I in the classical equilibrium thermodynamics.\n\n\n\nThe third postulate (Postulate II) addresses  the process (called a preparation process) in which the macroscopic systems are prepared to states at which the meso-description is found to agree  with a certain family of experimental observations forming the experimental basis of the meso-description. The time evolution making the preparation process is called  reducing time evolution.\nIn the classical equilibrium thermodynamics this postulate  is the static Maximum Entropy principle (static MaxEnt principle) specifying only the final result of the preparation process.\nIn the general MESO and  meso descriptions, it is dynamic MaxEnt principle postulating  equation  governing the time evolution  making the preparation processes. Two important  results   arise on the meso-level from  the static  or the dynamic MaxEnt principles. First, it  is the meso-level time evolution (the time evolution reduced from the time evolution on the MESO-level). Second, it is\nthe  fundamental thermodynamic relation that  is constructed from  the potential generating the reducing time evolution. The generating potential has the physical interpretation of  entropy if the meso-level in the approach MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso is the equilibrium level and entropy production (or related to it quantity) if the meso-level in the approach  MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso is a general meso-level.\nIn the classical,   or the Gibbs statistical,  equilibrium thermodynamics (i.e. if the meso-level in the approach MESO $\\rightarrow$ meso  is the equilibrium level) the reduced meso-dynamics is no dynamics. The fundamental thermodynamic relation in the context of the classical,  or the Gibbs statistical,  equilibrium thermodynamics is the classical equilibrium fundamental thermodynamic relation. In the context of MESO and meso descriptions of externally driven macroscopic systems it is a new relation on the meso-level representing their thermodynamics. This thermodynamics is not directly related to the meso-dynamics (as, indeed,  the classical equilibrium fundamental thermodynamic relation is not directly related to no dynamics at equilibrium).\nIt represents an extra information about  macroscopic systems. The meso-dynamics is the MESO-dynamics seen on the meso-level and the thermodynamics is an information extracted from the way how the details (that are seen on the MESO-level but are invisible on the meso-level) are being forgotten.\n\n\n\n\nThe fourth postulate (Postulate III of the classical equilibrium thermodynamics) addresses the value of entropy at zero absolute temperature. Investigations of macroscopic systems at such extreme conditions are outside the scope  of this paper. We are not  extending this postulate to mesoscopic dynamical theories.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that if we limit ourselves to one fixed meso-level (e.g. the level of fluid mechanics) then the dynamic and the thermodynamic modeling represent two essentially independent ways to investigate externally driven macroscopic systems. In particular, the validity and the pertinence of thermodynamic models does not depend on establishing their relation to the dynamic models. If however we make  our investigation simultaneously on two levels (one MESO-level and the other meso-level that involves  less details than the MESO-level) then we can derive both the meso-level dynamic and the meso-level thermodynamic models from  the MESO-level  dynamic model.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one of the illustration of the thermodynamics of driven systems that is worked out in the paper we consider binary immiscible blends and derive a formula for  volume fractions in the point of phase inversion (i.e. in the point at which the continuous phase and the dispersed phase exchange their roles).\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Acknowledgements}\n\nThis research was partially supported by  the Natural Sciences and Engineering\nResearch Council of Canada.\n\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\n\n\n\\bibitem{Arnold}\n Arnold, V.
