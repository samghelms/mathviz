Our runs include both standard\n  $\\Lambda$-cold dark matter (CDM) models, as well as several\n  additional simulations with sharply truncated density fluctuation\n  power spectra, such as those expected in a thermal warm dark matter\n  (WDM) scenario. As in earlier work, we find that the mass profiles\n  of CDM and WDM halos are self-similar and well approximated by the\n  Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. The $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation of CDM\n  halos is monotonic: concentrations decrease with increasing virial\n  mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift at\n  fixed mass. The main-progenitor mass accretion histories (MAHs) of\n  CDM halos are also scale-free, a result that has been used to infer\n  halo concentrations directly from MAHs. These results do not apply\n  to WDM halos: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the\n  characteristic scale imposed by the power-spectrum\n  suppression. Further, the WDM $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation is not monotonic:\n  concentrations peak at a halo mass scale dictated by the truncation\n  scale, and decrease at higher and lower masses. We show that the\n  assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer its\n  concentration, provided that the total mass of its collapsed\n  progenitors is considered (the ``collapsed mass history''; CMH),\n  rather than just that of its main ancestor. This follows the\n  original NFW proposal, and exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to\n  derive a simple scaling that reproduces the\n  mass-concentration-redshift relation of both CDM and WDM halos in our\n  simulations over a vast range of halo masses and cosmic time. Our\n  model therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift,\n  cosmology and power spectrum dependence of the concentrations of\n  dark matter halos assembled hierarchically.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\ncosmology: dark matter -- methods: numerical\n\\end{keywords}\n\\footnotetext[1]{E-mail: aaron.ludlow@durham.ac.uk} \n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{SecIntro}\n\nIt is now well established that \nthe density profiles of equilibrium dark matter (DM) halos have a\nuniversal form that can be accurately described by rescaling a simple formula\n\\citep[hereafter NFW]{Navarro1996,Navarro1997},\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\frac{\\rho(r)}{\\rho_{\\rm{crit}}}=\\frac{\\delta_c}{(r/r_s)(1+r/r_s)^2}.\n  \\label{eq:rho_nfw}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\rho(r)}{\\rho_{\\rm{crit}}}=\\frac{\\delta_{c}}{(r/r_{s})(1+r/r_{s})^{2}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>crit</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03b4</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02624.tex", "nexttext": "\nAn Einasto profile with $\\alpha\\approx 0.18$ provides an excellent\napproximation to NFW over several decades in radius.\n\nThe scaling parameters of the NFW and Einasto profiles can be\nexpressed in alternative forms, such as halo virial\\footnote{We\n  define the virial mass of a halo as that enclosed by a sphere\n  (centred on the potential minimum) of mean density equal to 200\n  times the critical density, $\\rho_{\\rm crit}=3H^2/8\\pi G$, where $H(z)$\n  is the Hubble constant; the virial radius is therefore implicitly\n  defined by $200\\rho_{\\rm crit}={\\rm M}_{200}/(4/3)\\pi r_{200}^3$.\n  Note that {\\em all} particles in the simulation are used in\n  calculating ${\\rm M}_{200}$ and not only those deemed\n  gravitationally bound to a particular halo.} mass, ${\\rm M}_{200}$, and\nconcentration, $c\\equiv r_{200}/r_{-2}$, defined as the ratio of the\nvirial radius to that of the scale radius. At a given halo mass, the\nconcentration provides an alternative measure of the characteristic\ndensity of a halo.\n\nAs discussed by NFW, ${\\rm M}_{200}$ and $c$ do not take on arbitrary\nvalues, but correlate in a way that reflects the mass-dependence of\nhalo formation times: those that assemble earlier have higher\ncharacteristic densities, reflecting the larger background density at\nthat epoch. They used this finding to build a simple analytic model\nbased on the extended Press-Schechter theory \\citep[EPS;][]{BCEK1991}\nthat reproduced the average mass\nand cosmology dependence of halo concentrations\nin their early simulations. \n\nSubsequent work by \\citet{Bullock2001} corroborated the general trends\nreported by NFW, but underscored a much stronger redshift dependence\nof the concentration-mass relation than expected from their\nmodel. These authors proposed a revised model that predicts \nconcentrations which, at fixed\nmass, scale linearly with expansion factor ($c\\propto (1+z)^{-1}$)\nand, at fixed $z$, fall off rapidly with increasing mass.\n\nLater numerical work, however, found a much weaker mass and redshift\ndependence than predicted by this model. Most notably, the\nconcentrations of very massive halos are found to be approximately\nconstant and to evolve little with redshift\n\\citep{Zhao2003a,Gao2008,Zhao2009}.\n\nEmpirical models that link halo concentrations to the shape of their\nassembly histories fare better. The models of \\citet{Wechsler2002} and\n\\citet{Zhao2003a}, for example, assume that the concentration is set\nby the changing accretion rate of a halo, with the characteristic\ndensity tracing the time when halos transition from an initial rapid\naccretion phase to a subsequent phase of slower growth.  Very massive\nsystems are still in their initial rapid-growth phase at present, thus\nexplaining why they all have similar concentrations.\n\nMore recently, \\citet[][hereafter L13]{Ludlow2013} used the Millennium\nsimulations (hereafter MS) to investigate the connection between CDM\nhalo assembly and structure. They pointed out that halo mass profiles\nand main-progenitor mass accretion histories (MAHs) are self-similar\nand have similar shapes. This becomes apparent when expressing mass\nprofiles in terms of average enclosed density,\n${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle(r))$, rather than radius, and MAHs in terms of\nmain progenitor mass as a function of cosmic density rather than time\nor redshift, i.e.  ${\\rm M}(\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z))$. Both follow the NFW\nprofile. The two ${\\rm M}(\\rho)$ functions can thus be linked by a simple\nscaling that allows the characteristic density of a halo (or its\nconcentration) to be inferred from the critical density of the\nUniverse at a characteristic time along its MAH.  \\citet[][hereafter\nL14]{Ludlow2014} showed how this result can be used to build a simple\nanalytic model for the mass-concentration-redshift relation that\naccurately reproduced the trends obtained for CDM halos in a large\nnumber of simulations, as well as the cosmology dependence of\n$c({\\rm M},z)$ reported in previous work.\n\nAlthough the model works well for CDM \\citep[see,\ne.g.,][]{Correa2015c}, its applicability to models with truncated\npower-spectra, such as those expected for ``warm'' dark matter (WDM),\nis unclear. Interest in such models has been revitalized by recent\nclaims of detection of a $\\sim$ 3.5 keV X-ray line, which is in\nprinciple consistent with the decay of a {\\rm warm} dark matter\nparticle \\citep[e.g.][but see, Malyshev, Neronov \\& Eckert 2014;\nAnderson, Churazov \\& Bregman 2015]{Bulbul2014,Boyarsky2014,Boyarsky2015}.\nThese results have motivated observations of dark matter dominated dwarf\ngalaxies of the Local Group \\citep{Lovell2015} which, to date, have\nnot provided compelling evidence for dark matter decay \\citep{Jeltema2015}.\n\nThe structure of WDM halos has been studied by \\citet{Maccio2013} and,\nmore recently, by \\citet{Bose2015}, who report that the NFW formula\naccounts well for their mass profile shape \n\\citep[see also, e.g.,][]{Knebe2002,VND2011,Polisensky2015,Gonzalez2015}. \nThe resulting $c({\\rm M})$\nrelation, however, is non-monotonic: concentrations reach a maximum at\na halo mass about 2 decades above the truncation scale but decline\ngradually towards larger and smaller masses. This implies that fairly\nmassive WDM halos can be as concentrated as low-mass ones although\nthe shape of their MAHs differ strongly, a feature that is difficult\nto reconcile with the MAH-based scenario discussed above for CDM.\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n \\begin{table*}\n   \\caption{Numerical aspects of our runs. $V_{\\rm box}$ \n     is the simulation volume; N$_{\\rm p}$ the total number of particles; $\\epsilon$ the \n     Plummer-equivalent gravitational force softening; $m_{\\rm p}$ the particle\n     mass, and $m_{\\rm WDM}$ the assumed mass of the thermal WDM particle\n     and M$_{\\rm{ hm}}$ the half-mode mass of its fluctuation power spectrum\n     (left blank for cold dark matter models).

One\nexception is the work of \\citet{Eke2001}, who assumed that both the\nnormalization and {\\em shape} of the power spectrum modulates\n$c({\\rm M},z)$. By including a term proportional to\n$d\\ln\\sigma/d\\ln {\\rm M}$ in the definition of the collapse time they were\nable to reproduce the concentration-mass relation in both CDM models\nas well as several with truncated power spectra. This particular\nparametrization, however, does not lend itself to simple\ninterpretation and predictions of their model were not borne out by\nmore recent simulations \\citep[e.g.,][]{Gao2008,Diemer2015}.\n\nIt is clear that a full picture of DM halo structure must address\nnot only the mass and cosmological parameter dependence of halo\nconcentrations, but also the effect of the initial density fluctuation\nspectrum. As more and more observations sensitive to the small-scale\nclustering of DM become available, theoretical tools such as these\nwill be indispensable. This is the focus of the current paper.\nUsing a large suite of CDM and WDM cosmological simulations we\nstudy the relationship between halo assembly and structure, paying\nparticular attention to the signature of a potential WDM particle.\n\nOur paper is structured as follows. We begin with a description of our\nsimulations in Section~\\ref{SecSims}; their analysis (including halo\nfinding, merger tree construction and density profile estimates) are\noutlined in Section~\\ref{SecCatalogs}. In Section~\\ref{SecRes} we\npresent our main results. The mass-concentration-redshift relation\nand its connection to halo assembly are presented in\nSections~\\ref{sSec_cmz} and \\ref{sSec_MAH}. We then use these results\nto build a simple analytic model for $c({\\rm M},z)$ in\nSection~\\ref{sSec_model}, which is compared to other available models\nin Sections~\\ref{sSec_model_comp_cc} and \\ref{sSec_model_comp}. \nFinally, in Section~\\ref{SecConc}, we provide a summary of our findings.\nWe elaborate on various aspect of our $c({\\rm M},z)$ model in \nAppendix~\\ref{AppComp} and \\ref{AppModel} and provide an accurate \nfitting function for CDM halos in the Planck cosmology in Appendix~\\ref{AppPlanck}.\n\n\n\\section{Numerical Simulations}\n\\label{SecSims}\n\nOur analysis focuses on the growth histories and internal structure of\ncollisionless dark\nmatter halos identified in a suite of cosmological numerical\nsimulations. The majority of our results are based on the Copernicus\nComplexio (COCO) simulations \\citep{Hellwing2015,Bose2015},\nsupplemented by the Millennium \n\\citep{Springel2005a,Boylan-Kolchin2009,Angulo2012} and Aquarius simulations\n\\citep{Springel2008b,Lovell2014}, and an additional suite of $\\Lambda$CDM \nruns which vary the parameters of the background cosmological model. The main \naspects of these models are detailed in Tables~\\ref{TabSimParam} and \n\\ref{TabCosmoParam}. We provide here a brief description of the runs, but \nrefer the reader to the original papers for a more thorough discussion. \n\nNote that in each of our WDM simulations we can safely neglect the \nintrinsic thermal velocities of the particles which, at $z=0$, are of\norder a few tens of $m s^{-1}$. These particles will free-stream\nonly a few kiloparsecs over a Hubble time, which is comparable to our\ninterparticle separation \\citep[see][]{Lovell2012}.\n\n\\subsection{The Copernicus Complexio simulations}\n\\label{SecCOCO}\n\nThe \\textsc{coco} simulations track the evolution of dark matter in an\napproximately spherical high-resolution volume of radius $\\sim$\n$18{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$ embedded within a lower-resolution periodic box of\nside-length $70.4{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$. The high-resolution region contains\napproximately 13 billion particles and was chosen in order to provide\na cosmologically representative sample of Milky Way-mass halos whilst\navoiding the unnecessary computational overhead of including\nsubstantially more massive systems. To this end, the high-resolution\nregion was selected so that: 1) it includes no halos more massive than\n$5\\times 10^{13}\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$; 2) has no halos more massive\nthan $5\\times 10^{14}\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ within $\\sim 5{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$ of its\nboundary, and 3) has a number density of $\\sim 10^{12}\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot$\nhalos that matches the universal halo mass function.\n\nLinear perturbations were generated at $z=127$ using second-order\nLagrangian perturbation theory \\citep{Jenkins2013} assuming a standard $\\Lambda$CDM power\nspectrum, as well as with a truncated power spectrum compatible with a\n3.3 keV thermal WDM particle. We will hereafter refer to these runs as\n\\textsc{coco-cold} and \\textsc{coco-warm}, respectively. Both simulations have identical \nphases and cosmological parameters, the latter adopting values consistent\nwith the WMAP 7-year data release \\citep{Komatsu2011}: $\\Omega_{\\rm M}=0.272$,\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.728$, $\\sigma_8=0.81$, $h=0.704$, and\n$n_{\\rm s}=0.967$. Here $\\Omega_i$ is the present-day contribution to the\nenergy density from component $i$; $\\sigma_8$ the linearly extrapolated rms\nmass-fluctuation in spheres of 8{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}; $h$ is the current Hubble\nexpansion rate in units of $100{ \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1} \\, Mpc^{-1}}$;\nand $n_{\\rm s}$ is the primordial spectral index of density\nperturbations. With these choices of cosmological and numerical\nparameters, the high-resolution particle-mass in the \\textsc{coco} runs is\n$m_{\\rm p}= 1.135\\times 10^5\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.\n\nWe have also run a lower resolution version of the \\textsc{coco-warm} simulation\nassuming a lighter WDM particle of mass 1.5 keV. We will refer to this\nrun as \\textsc{color-1.5} (\\textsc{COco-LOw Resolution}, 1.5 keV). This run adopts the same \nset of WMAP-7 cosmological parameters, but samples the full $70.4{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$ box with\n1620$^3$ particles of equal mass, $m_{\\rm p}=6.2\\times 10^6\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. \nWe will use this run to assess the effect of changing the thermal cut-off in\nthe dark matter power spectrum on the internal structure of DM halos.\n\n\\subsection{The Millennium and Aquarius simulations}\n\\label{SecMill}\n\nBecause of the relatively small volume of the \\textsc{coco} simulations, we\nwill extend the dynamic range of our analysis using \nthe Millennium simulation suite. Each of these runs \nadopts cosmological parameters which were chosen to match\nthe WMAP-1 $\\Lambda$CDM values -- $\\Omega_{\\rm M}=0.25$;\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.75$; $\\sigma_8=0.9$; $h=0.73$; $n_{\\rm s}=1$ -- but\ndiffer in both total particle number and in box size. The\nMillennium \\citep{Springel2005a} and Millennium-II \\citep{Boylan-Kolchin2009}\nsimulations evolve the dark matter density field using ${\\rm N_p}=2160^3$\nparticles in periodic boxes with side-lengths equal to 500 and\n100{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}, respectively. The Millennium-XXL simulation\n\\citep{Angulo2012} adopts both a larger\nparticle number, ${\\rm N_p}=6720^3$, and box-size, \n${\\rm L_{box}}=3\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc}$, than either MS or MS-II. \n\nWe also use the latest suite of CDM and WDM simulations from the\nAquarius Project \\citep{Lovell2014}.  Like \\textsc{coco}, the Aquarius\nsimulations assumed a WMAP-7-normalized power spectrum, but focused\ncomputational resources on a single Milky Way-mass\ndark matter halo and its surroundings. Each run has the same\nhigh-resolution particle mass,\n$m_{\\rm p}=1.09\\times 10^4\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ (equivalent to level-2\nin the original nomenclature of the Aquarius Project), and identical\nphases of the initial Gaussian random field, but adopt transfer\nfunctions appropriate for CDM and thermal WDM models of mass\n$m_{\\rm WDM}=2.3, 2.0, 1.6$ and 1.5 keV.\n\n\\subsection{Additional runs}\n\\label{SecCosmo}\n\nWe have also carried out four additional flat $\\Lambda$CDM simulations which\nvary the parameters of the background cosmological model. Each run\nuses 1080$^3$ equal-mass particles, assumes $h=0.73$ and $n_{\\rm s}=1$, but\nvaries the matter density parameter, $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, and rms fluctuation\namplitude, $\\sigma_8$.

The substructure finder \\textsc{subfind}\n\\citep{Springel2001b} was then run\non the remaining FoF groups in order to identify their self-bound\nsubhalos. \\textsc{subfind} decomposes each FoF group into a dominant (or central)\nsubhalo and a contingent of less-massive subhalos\nthat trace the self-bound relics of past accretion events. For simplicity,\nwe will refer to the assemblage of each central halo and its full subhalo \npopulation as a ``main halo''. \n\nFor each main halo, \\textsc{subfind} records a virial mass, ${\\rm M}_{200}$, and associated\nradius, $r_{200}$. For our analysis we will retain only main halos that\nexist as distinct objects at $z_0=0,1,2$ or 3 and, additionally, contain at least \n${\\rm N}_{200}=5000$ particles within their virial radius.\n\n\\subsection{Assembly histories}\n\\label{SecMAH}\n\nThe halo catalogue is used to construct merger trees for each \nmain halo following the procedure described in \\citet{Jiang2014}.\nThis method tracks particles within each \nsubhalo across simulation outputs in order to determine their descendants.\nSubhalos and their descendants are then split into unique branches, with\nnew branches growing when a subhalo first appears in the simulation and\ncontinuing until it has fully merged with a more massive system. The\nmerger tree of a particular halo is then constructed by packaging\nthe \\textsc{subfind} merger trees of each of its surviving subhalos.\n\nUsing these merger trees we construct mass accretion histories for each \nhalo, defined as the evolution of the virial mass, ${\\rm M}_{200}(z)$, of its \n{\\em main progenitor} (hereafter MAH). The left panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_unscaled}\nshows, for halos identified at $z_0=0$, the median MAHs computed in three separate\nmass bins. Solid (blue) curves correspond to \\textsc{coco-cold}; dot-dashed (orange) curves\nto \\textsc{coco-warm}. Note that the MAHs of CDM and WDM halos differ\nstrongly below the characteristic mass scale imposed by the free-streaming\nof the WDM particle, shown here as a horizontal grey line at the\n``half-mode'' mass\\footnote{The half-mode mass, ${\\rm M}_{\\rm hm}$, indicates the scale at\n  which the WDM transfer function is reduced by half relative to a\n  CDM model with the same cosmological parameters. In our\n  \\textsc{coco-warm} model this corresponds to ${\\rm M}_{\\rm hm}=2.46\\times\n  10^8 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, and in \\textsc{color-1.5} to ${\\rm M}_{\\rm\n    hm}=3.4\\times 10^9 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. Half-mode masses\n  for our remaining WDM runs are provided in Table~\\ref{TabSimParam}.}.\n\nAlthough the MAH provides a useful proxy for the assembly history of a\nhalo, it neglects the full spectrum of progenitors that contribute to\nits growth, motivating alternative measures. One possibility is to\ntally the mass of {\\em all} progenitors that have collapsed by\nredshift $z$ and that are above some fraction $f$ of the halo's final mass,\n${\\rm M}_0$. This quantity, referred to as the ``collapsed mass\nhistory'' (CMH) and denoted ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$,\nhas a simple interpretation and is easily extracted from simulated or\ntheoretical DM merger trees.\n\nThe right-hand panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_unscaled} shows\nthe CMH for $z_0=0$ halos in the same mass bins as\nthose used in the left-hand panel. Solid (blue) curves again\nindicate \\textsc{coco-cold} halos and dot-dashed (orange)\n\\textsc{coco-warm}; all assume $f=0.02$. Unlike ${\\rm M}_{200}(z)$,\nthese curves do not show a characteristic suppression of growth below\nthe WDM free-streaming scale. This may be readily understood using the\nEPS theory to compute analytically the collapsed mass fraction \n\\citep[e.g.][]{Lacey1993}:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 3726, "prevtext": "\nKnow as the ``NFW profile'', eq.~\\ref{eq:rho_nfw} is fully specified\nby two parameters -- a characteristic radius, $r_s$, and a\ncharacteristic overdensity, $\\delta_{\\rm c}$ -- and provides\nacceptable fits to DM halos independent of mass, cosmology and\nfluctuation power spectra\n\\citep[e.g. NFW;][]{Cole1996,Huss1999,Eke2001,Bullock2001,Power2003,Neto2007,Wang2009}. \nThe characteristic radius defines the scale at which the logarithmic slope\nof the density profile has the isothermal value of -2,\ni.e. $d\\ln\\rho/d\\ln r|_{r_{-2}}=-2$.

This smooths out any features unique to individual systems \nand dampens the influence of outliers allowing for a robust estimate of the \naverage mass and redshift-dependence of halo concentrations. \n\nIn practice, best-fit concentrations are determined by adjusting the\nthree parameters of eq.~\\ref{eq:rho_einasto} in order to minimize a \nfigure-of-merit, defined by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 26248, "prevtext": "\nAn Einasto profile with $\\alpha\\approx 0.18$ provides an excellent\napproximation to NFW over several decades in radius.\n\nThe scaling parameters of the NFW and Einasto profiles can be\nexpressed in alternative forms, such as halo virial\\footnote{We\n  define the virial mass of a halo as that enclosed by a sphere\n  (centred on the potential minimum) of mean density equal to 200\n  times the critical density, $\\rho_{\\rm crit}=3H^2/8\\pi G$, where $H(z)$\n  is the Hubble constant; the virial radius is therefore implicitly\n  defined by $200\\rho_{\\rm crit}={\\rm M}_{200}/(4/3)\\pi r_{200}^3$.\n  Note that {\\em all} particles in the simulation are used in\n  calculating ${\\rm M}_{200}$ and not only those deemed\n  gravitationally bound to a particular halo.} mass, ${\\rm M}_{200}$, and\nconcentration, $c\\equiv r_{200}/r_{-2}$, defined as the ratio of the\nvirial radius to that of the scale radius. At a given halo mass, the\nconcentration provides an alternative measure of the characteristic\ndensity of a halo.\n\nAs discussed by NFW, ${\\rm M}_{200}$ and $c$ do not take on arbitrary\nvalues, but correlate in a way that reflects the mass-dependence of\nhalo formation times: those that assemble earlier have higher\ncharacteristic densities, reflecting the larger background density at\nthat epoch. They used this finding to build a simple analytic model\nbased on the extended Press-Schechter theory \\citep[EPS;][]{BCEK1991}\nthat reproduced the average mass\nand cosmology dependence of halo concentrations\nin their early simulations. \n\nSubsequent work by \\citet{Bullock2001} corroborated the general trends\nreported by NFW, but underscored a much stronger redshift dependence\nof the concentration-mass relation than expected from their\nmodel. These authors proposed a revised model that predicts \nconcentrations which, at fixed\nmass, scale linearly with expansion factor ($c\\propto (1+z)^{-1}$)\nand, at fixed $z$, fall off rapidly with increasing mass.\n\nLater numerical work, however, found a much weaker mass and redshift\ndependence than predicted by this model. Most notably, the\nconcentrations of very massive halos are found to be approximately\nconstant and to evolve little with redshift\n\\citep{Zhao2003a,Gao2008,Zhao2009}.\n\nEmpirical models that link halo concentrations to the shape of their\nassembly histories fare better. The models of \\citet{Wechsler2002} and\n\\citet{Zhao2003a}, for example, assume that the concentration is set\nby the changing accretion rate of a halo, with the characteristic\ndensity tracing the time when halos transition from an initial rapid\naccretion phase to a subsequent phase of slower growth.  Very massive\nsystems are still in their initial rapid-growth phase at present, thus\nexplaining why they all have similar concentrations.\n\nMore recently, \\citet[][hereafter L13]{Ludlow2013} used the Millennium\nsimulations (hereafter MS) to investigate the connection between CDM\nhalo assembly and structure. They pointed out that halo mass profiles\nand main-progenitor mass accretion histories (MAHs) are self-similar\nand have similar shapes. This becomes apparent when expressing mass\nprofiles in terms of average enclosed density,\n${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle(r))$, rather than radius, and MAHs in terms of\nmain progenitor mass as a function of cosmic density rather than time\nor redshift, i.e.  ${\\rm M}(\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z))$. Both follow the NFW\nprofile. The two ${\\rm M}(\\rho)$ functions can thus be linked by a simple\nscaling that allows the characteristic density of a halo (or its\nconcentration) to be inferred from the critical density of the\nUniverse at a characteristic time along its MAH.  \\citet[][hereafter\nL14]{Ludlow2014} showed how this result can be used to build a simple\nanalytic model for the mass-concentration-redshift relation that\naccurately reproduced the trends obtained for CDM halos in a large\nnumber of simulations, as well as the cosmology dependence of\n$c({\\rm M},z)$ reported in previous work.\n\nAlthough the model works well for CDM \\citep[see,\ne.g.,][]{Correa2015c}, its applicability to models with truncated\npower-spectra, such as those expected for ``warm'' dark matter (WDM),\nis unclear. Interest in such models has been revitalized by recent\nclaims of detection of a $\\sim$ 3.5 keV X-ray line, which is in\nprinciple consistent with the decay of a {\\rm warm} dark matter\nparticle \\citep[e.g.][but see, Malyshev, Neronov \\& Eckert 2014;\nAnderson, Churazov \\& Bregman 2015]{Bulbul2014,Boyarsky2014,Boyarsky2015}.\nThese results have motivated observations of dark matter dominated dwarf\ngalaxies of the Local Group \\citep{Lovell2015} which, to date, have\nnot provided compelling evidence for dark matter decay \\citep{Jeltema2015}.\n\nThe structure of WDM halos has been studied by \\citet{Maccio2013} and,\nmore recently, by \\citet{Bose2015}, who report that the NFW formula\naccounts well for their mass profile shape \n\\citep[see also, e.g.,][]{Knebe2002,VND2011,Polisensky2015,Gonzalez2015}. \nThe resulting $c({\\rm M})$\nrelation, however, is non-monotonic: concentrations reach a maximum at\na halo mass about 2 decades above the truncation scale but decline\ngradually towards larger and smaller masses. This implies that fairly\nmassive WDM halos can be as concentrated as low-mass ones although\nthe shape of their MAHs differ strongly, a feature that is difficult\nto reconcile with the MAH-based scenario discussed above for CDM.\n\n\n\\begin{center}\n \\begin{table*}\n   \\caption{Numerical aspects of our runs. $V_{\\rm box}$ \n     is the simulation volume; N$_{\\rm p}$ the total number of particles; $\\epsilon$ the \n     Plummer-equivalent gravitational force softening; $m_{\\rm p}$ the particle\n     mass, and $m_{\\rm WDM}$ the assumed mass of the thermal WDM particle\n     and M$_{\\rm{ hm}}$ the half-mode mass of its fluctuation power spectrum\n     (left blank for cold dark matter models).

By including a term proportional to\n$d\\ln\\sigma/d\\ln {\\rm M}$ in the definition of the collapse time they were\nable to reproduce the concentration-mass relation in both CDM models\nas well as several with truncated power spectra. This particular\nparametrization, however, does not lend itself to simple\ninterpretation and predictions of their model were not borne out by\nmore recent simulations \\citep[e.g.,][]{Gao2008,Diemer2015}.\n\nIt is clear that a full picture of DM halo structure must address\nnot only the mass and cosmological parameter dependence of halo\nconcentrations, but also the effect of the initial density fluctuation\nspectrum. As more and more observations sensitive to the small-scale\nclustering of DM become available, theoretical tools such as these\nwill be indispensable. This is the focus of the current paper.\nUsing a large suite of CDM and WDM cosmological simulations we\nstudy the relationship between halo assembly and structure, paying\nparticular attention to the signature of a potential WDM particle.\n\nOur paper is structured as follows. We begin with a description of our\nsimulations in Section~\\ref{SecSims}; their analysis (including halo\nfinding, merger tree construction and density profile estimates) are\noutlined in Section~\\ref{SecCatalogs}. In Section~\\ref{SecRes} we\npresent our main results. The mass-concentration-redshift relation\nand its connection to halo assembly are presented in\nSections~\\ref{sSec_cmz} and \\ref{sSec_MAH}. We then use these results\nto build a simple analytic model for $c({\\rm M},z)$ in\nSection~\\ref{sSec_model}, which is compared to other available models\nin Sections~\\ref{sSec_model_comp_cc} and \\ref{sSec_model_comp}. \nFinally, in Section~\\ref{SecConc}, we provide a summary of our findings.\nWe elaborate on various aspect of our $c({\\rm M},z)$ model in \nAppendix~\\ref{AppComp} and \\ref{AppModel} and provide an accurate \nfitting function for CDM halos in the Planck cosmology in Appendix~\\ref{AppPlanck}.\n\n\n\\section{Numerical Simulations}\n\\label{SecSims}\n\nOur analysis focuses on the growth histories and internal structure of\ncollisionless dark\nmatter halos identified in a suite of cosmological numerical\nsimulations. The majority of our results are based on the Copernicus\nComplexio (COCO) simulations \\citep{Hellwing2015,Bose2015},\nsupplemented by the Millennium \n\\citep{Springel2005a,Boylan-Kolchin2009,Angulo2012} and Aquarius simulations\n\\citep{Springel2008b,Lovell2014}, and an additional suite of $\\Lambda$CDM \nruns which vary the parameters of the background cosmological model. The main \naspects of these models are detailed in Tables~\\ref{TabSimParam} and \n\\ref{TabCosmoParam}. We provide here a brief description of the runs, but \nrefer the reader to the original papers for a more thorough discussion. \n\nNote that in each of our WDM simulations we can safely neglect the \nintrinsic thermal velocities of the particles which, at $z=0$, are of\norder a few tens of $m s^{-1}$. These particles will free-stream\nonly a few kiloparsecs over a Hubble time, which is comparable to our\ninterparticle separation \\citep[see][]{Lovell2012}.\n\n\\subsection{The Copernicus Complexio simulations}\n\\label{SecCOCO}\n\nThe \\textsc{coco} simulations track the evolution of dark matter in an\napproximately spherical high-resolution volume of radius $\\sim$\n$18{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$ embedded within a lower-resolution periodic box of\nside-length $70.4{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$. The high-resolution region contains\napproximately 13 billion particles and was chosen in order to provide\na cosmologically representative sample of Milky Way-mass halos whilst\navoiding the unnecessary computational overhead of including\nsubstantially more massive systems. To this end, the high-resolution\nregion was selected so that: 1) it includes no halos more massive than\n$5\\times 10^{13}\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$; 2) has no halos more massive\nthan $5\\times 10^{14}\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ within $\\sim 5{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$ of its\nboundary, and 3) has a number density of $\\sim 10^{12}\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot$\nhalos that matches the universal halo mass function.\n\nLinear perturbations were generated at $z=127$ using second-order\nLagrangian perturbation theory \\citep{Jenkins2013} assuming a standard $\\Lambda$CDM power\nspectrum, as well as with a truncated power spectrum compatible with a\n3.3 keV thermal WDM particle. We will hereafter refer to these runs as\n\\textsc{coco-cold} and \\textsc{coco-warm}, respectively. Both simulations have identical \nphases and cosmological parameters, the latter adopting values consistent\nwith the WMAP 7-year data release \\citep{Komatsu2011}: $\\Omega_{\\rm M}=0.272$,\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.728$, $\\sigma_8=0.81$, $h=0.704$, and\n$n_{\\rm s}=0.967$. Here $\\Omega_i$ is the present-day contribution to the\nenergy density from component $i$; $\\sigma_8$ the linearly extrapolated rms\nmass-fluctuation in spheres of 8{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}; $h$ is the current Hubble\nexpansion rate in units of $100{ \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1} \\, Mpc^{-1}}$;\nand $n_{\\rm s}$ is the primordial spectral index of density\nperturbations. With these choices of cosmological and numerical\nparameters, the high-resolution particle-mass in the \\textsc{coco} runs is\n$m_{\\rm p}= 1.135\\times 10^5\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.\n\nWe have also run a lower resolution version of the \\textsc{coco-warm} simulation\nassuming a lighter WDM particle of mass 1.5 keV. We will refer to this\nrun as \\textsc{color-1.5} (\\textsc{COco-LOw Resolution}, 1.5 keV). This run adopts the same \nset of WMAP-7 cosmological parameters, but samples the full $70.4{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}$ box with\n1620$^3$ particles of equal mass, $m_{\\rm p}=6.2\\times 10^6\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. \nWe will use this run to assess the effect of changing the thermal cut-off in\nthe dark matter power spectrum on the internal structure of DM halos.\n\n\\subsection{The Millennium and Aquarius simulations}\n\\label{SecMill}\n\nBecause of the relatively small volume of the \\textsc{coco} simulations, we\nwill extend the dynamic range of our analysis using \nthe Millennium simulation suite. Each of these runs \nadopts cosmological parameters which were chosen to match\nthe WMAP-1 $\\Lambda$CDM values -- $\\Omega_{\\rm M}=0.25$;\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.75$; $\\sigma_8=0.9$; $h=0.73$; $n_{\\rm s}=1$ -- but\ndiffer in both total particle number and in box size. The\nMillennium \\citep{Springel2005a} and Millennium-II \\citep{Boylan-Kolchin2009}\nsimulations evolve the dark matter density field using ${\\rm N_p}=2160^3$\nparticles in periodic boxes with side-lengths equal to 500 and\n100{\\mbox{ $h^{-1}$ Mpc}}, respectively. The Millennium-XXL simulation\n\\citep{Angulo2012} adopts both a larger\nparticle number, ${\\rm N_p}=6720^3$, and box-size, \n${\\rm L_{box}}=3\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc}$, than either MS or MS-II. \n\nWe also use the latest suite of CDM and WDM simulations from the\nAquarius Project \\citep{Lovell2014}.  Like \\textsc{coco}, the Aquarius\nsimulations assumed a WMAP-7-normalized power spectrum, but focused\ncomputational resources on a single Milky Way-mass\ndark matter halo and its surroundings. Each run has the same\nhigh-resolution particle mass,\n$m_{\\rm p}=1.09\\times 10^4\\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ (equivalent to level-2\nin the original nomenclature of the Aquarius Project), and identical\nphases of the initial Gaussian random field, but adopt transfer\nfunctions appropriate for CDM and thermal WDM models of mass\n$m_{\\rm WDM}=2.3, 2.0, 1.6$ and 1.5 keV.\n\n\\subsection{Additional runs}\n\\label{SecCosmo}\n\nWe have also carried out four additional flat $\\Lambda$CDM simulations which\nvary the parameters of the background cosmological model. Each run\nuses 1080$^3$ equal-mass particles, assumes $h=0.73$ and $n_{\\rm s}=1$, but\nvaries the matter density parameter, $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, and rms fluctuation\namplitude, $\\sigma_8$.

The substructure finder \\textsc{subfind}\n\\citep{Springel2001b} was then run\non the remaining FoF groups in order to identify their self-bound\nsubhalos. \\textsc{subfind} decomposes each FoF group into a dominant (or central)\nsubhalo and a contingent of less-massive subhalos\nthat trace the self-bound relics of past accretion events. For simplicity,\nwe will refer to the assemblage of each central halo and its full subhalo \npopulation as a ``main halo''. \n\nFor each main halo, \\textsc{subfind} records a virial mass, ${\\rm M}_{200}$, and associated\nradius, $r_{200}$. For our analysis we will retain only main halos that\nexist as distinct objects at $z_0=0,1,2$ or 3 and, additionally, contain at least \n${\\rm N}_{200}=5000$ particles within their virial radius.\n\n\\subsection{Assembly histories}\n\\label{SecMAH}\n\nThe halo catalogue is used to construct merger trees for each \nmain halo following the procedure described in \\citet{Jiang2014}.\nThis method tracks particles within each \nsubhalo across simulation outputs in order to determine their descendants.\nSubhalos and their descendants are then split into unique branches, with\nnew branches growing when a subhalo first appears in the simulation and\ncontinuing until it has fully merged with a more massive system. The\nmerger tree of a particular halo is then constructed by packaging\nthe \\textsc{subfind} merger trees of each of its surviving subhalos.\n\nUsing these merger trees we construct mass accretion histories for each \nhalo, defined as the evolution of the virial mass, ${\\rm M}_{200}(z)$, of its \n{\\em main progenitor} (hereafter MAH). The left panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_unscaled}\nshows, for halos identified at $z_0=0$, the median MAHs computed in three separate\nmass bins. Solid (blue) curves correspond to \\textsc{coco-cold}; dot-dashed (orange) curves\nto \\textsc{coco-warm}. Note that the MAHs of CDM and WDM halos differ\nstrongly below the characteristic mass scale imposed by the free-streaming\nof the WDM particle, shown here as a horizontal grey line at the\n``half-mode'' mass\\footnote{The half-mode mass, ${\\rm M}_{\\rm hm}$, indicates the scale at\n  which the WDM transfer function is reduced by half relative to a\n  CDM model with the same cosmological parameters. In our\n  \\textsc{coco-warm} model this corresponds to ${\\rm M}_{\\rm hm}=2.46\\times\n  10^8 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, and in \\textsc{color-1.5} to ${\\rm M}_{\\rm\n    hm}=3.4\\times 10^9 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. Half-mode masses\n  for our remaining WDM runs are provided in Table~\\ref{TabSimParam}.}.\n\nAlthough the MAH provides a useful proxy for the assembly history of a\nhalo, it neglects the full spectrum of progenitors that contribute to\nits growth, motivating alternative measures. One possibility is to\ntally the mass of {\\em all} progenitors that have collapsed by\nredshift $z$ and that are above some fraction $f$ of the halo's final mass,\n${\\rm M}_0$. This quantity, referred to as the ``collapsed mass\nhistory'' (CMH) and denoted ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$,\nhas a simple interpretation and is easily extracted from simulated or\ntheoretical DM merger trees.\n\nThe right-hand panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_unscaled} shows\nthe CMH for $z_0=0$ halos in the same mass bins as\nthose used in the left-hand panel. Solid (blue) curves again\nindicate \\textsc{coco-cold} halos and dot-dashed (orange)\n\\textsc{coco-warm}; all assume $f=0.02$. Unlike ${\\rm M}_{200}(z)$,\nthese curves do not show a characteristic suppression of growth below\nthe WDM free-streaming scale.

These events can drive large but transient departures\nfrom quasi-equilibrium states during which the structural properties\nof DM halos are rapidly evolving and ill defined. As a result, the\nmajority of studies aimed at calibrating the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation\nhave taken steps to identify and excise halos believed to be far from\nequilibrium, thereby defining samples of ``relaxed'' halos with smooth\nmass profiles whose structural features can be meaningfully described\nwith a few parameters. It is important to note, however, that relaxed\nhalos form a highly biased sub-sample of the full halo population, and\ntheir prevalence depends in non-trivial ways on both halo mass and on\nredshift \\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Neto2007,Power2012,Ludlow2012,Klypin2014,Angel2015}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig3.png}\n  \\caption{Mass-concentration-redshift relation for \\textsc{coco-cold}\n    (blue), \\textsc{coco-warm} (red), and \\textsc{color-1.5} (green).\n    Fits to individual halos are shown as coloured dots; heavy points\n    correspond to the best-fit relation derived from the {\\em stacked}\n    mass profiles of halos in equally-spaced logarithmic mass bins of\n    width $0.1$ dex. Only bins containing at least 25 halos are shown.\n    Note that in WDM model the concentration-mass relation is\n    non-monotonic, and peaks at a mass scale that is a multiple of the\n    free-streaming scale associated with the WDM particle. The\n    arrows indicate a mass scale corresponding to one hundred\n    times the half-mode mass, where the\n    WDM power spectrum is suppressed by 50 per cent relative to CDM.\n    The solid lines correspond to the predictions of the analytic\n    model described in Section \\ref{sSec_model} (see text for\n    details).}\n  \\label{fig:cmz}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nIdentifying relaxed halos is not without ambiguity, and\na number of diagnostics have been proposed in the literature.\nSome are sensitive to geometric halo properties, such as the\ncentre-of-mass offset parameter, defined as $d_{\\rm off}=|\\mathbf{r}_p-\\mathbf{r}_{\\rm\n  CM}|/r_{200}$ \\citep{Thomas2001,Maccio2007,Neto2007}, or the\nmass-fraction in substructure \\citep[e.g.][]{Neto2007,Ludlow2012};\nothers, such as the virial ratio, $\\eta=2\\, K/|U|$\n\\citep[e.g.][]{ColeLacey1996,Bett2007,KP2008}, or spin parameter, \n$\\lambda$ \\citep[e.g.][]{Klypin2014}, gauge the internal dynamical state \nof the halo. Some authors reject halos whose spherically average\ndensity profiles are poorly described by their chosen fitting \nformulae \\citep[e.g.][]{Maccio2007,Maccio2008,Dutton2014}.\n\n\\citet{Neto2007} suggested a combination of three criteria that may be\nused to curtail halos whose mass profiles are most likely to deviate\nfrom smooth spherical averages. These include: (i) the centre-of-mass\noffset, $d_{\\rm off}<0.07$, (ii) the substructure mass fraction,\n$f_{\\rm sub}=M_{\\rm sub}(<r_{200})/{\\rm M}_{200}<0.1$, and (iii) the\nvirial ratio, $\\eta<1.35$. During a merger each of these quantities\nfluctuate in predictable ways: $d_{\\rm off}$, for example, traces the\ncentre-of-mass of a merging system about its densest core, providing\nan estimate of the accuracy with which the halo centre can be defined;\n$f_{\\rm sub}$ monitors the mass contribution from undigested mergers,\nwhile $\\eta$ is sensitive to fluctuations in the gravitational\npotential as orbital energy is dissipated into binding energy.  As\ndiscussed by \\citet{Ludlow2012} and also \\citet{Poole2015},\nmerger-driven oscillations in these quantities are out of sync, making\nit unlikely that a halo will simultaneously fail all three at any\npoint during a merger.\n\nAre these criteria sufficient to ensure removal of all unrelaxed\nhalos? Arguably not. Because of its resolution dependence, only halos\nwith well-resolved substructure populations are sensitive to\n$f_{\\rm sub}$. In simulations with uniform mass resolution (such as\nthose used in this work) the least resolved halos are also the most\nabundant; $f_{\\rm sub}$ is therefore a useful equilibrium statistic\nfor only the most massive, best-resolved systems. Furthermore, since\nDM halos are not truly isolated, the virial ratio should be corrected\nfor external forces and surface pressure terms \\citep[see, e.g.,][for\na discussion]{pooleg2006,KP2008,Klypin2014} and only then can it be\nused to meaningfully assess departures from equilibrium.\n\nBecause of these uncertainties we here adopt a simpler approach and\nuse the {\\em dynamical age} of a system as the primary diagnostic for\nequilibrium.  We assume that any halo whose main progenitor has more\nthan doubled in mass in under a crossing time cannot have had time to\nrelax to an equilibrium configuration. More specifically, we require\n$t_{50}{\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}} 1.25\\times t_{\\rm cross}$ as a minimal but necessary\ncondition for equilibrium. Here\n$t_{\\rm cross}\\equiv 2\\times r_{200}/{\\rm V}_{200}$ is the\ncharacteristic crossing time of a halo and $t_{50}$ is the lookback\nhalf-mass formation time of its main progenitor. This single\ncriterion, however, will only flag halos undergoing very rapid\naccretion or equal-mass mergers. For that reason, we additionally\nimpose the familiar criterion $d_{\\rm off}<0.1$ to cull the remainder\nof the population. We will see in Appendix~\\ref{AppComp} that\nimposing these criteria on MS halos results in a $c({\\rm M},z)$\nrelation that decreases monotonically with mass over the redshift\nrange probed by our simulations, removing the ``upturn'' in the\nconcentration of high-mass halos reported by \\citet{Klypin2011} \n(see \\citet{Ludlow2012} for further details).\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig4.pdf}\n  \\caption{Enclosed density profiles, ${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ (dashed\n    lines) and assembly histories (solid lines) for halos in\n    \\textsc{coco-warm} at redshift $z=0$ (left panels) and $z=1$\n    (right panels).

Unlike CDM, where concentrations increase monotonically with\ndecreasing mass, in WDM models the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation has a\ncharacteristic shape: it first increases with decreasing mass, but\nreaches a well-defined maximum before decreasing again towards lower\nmass. Note that in the 3.3 and 1.5 keV models studied here the mass\nscale at which the peak concentration is reached is roughly\nindependent of redshift. Note also that differences between WDM and\nCDM are already evident at mass scales substantially larger than the\nfree-streaming scale.  For example, the ``peak'' in the median\nconcentration of WDM halos occurs approximately {\\em two orders of\n  magnitude above the half-mode mass}, suggesting that differences in\nthe very early stages of halo growth leave a lasting imprint on the\nfinal halo. We highlight this point using coloured arrows, which \ncorrespond to {\\em one hundred times} the half-mode mass of each WDM run. \nThis provides an important clue for models that aim to fully describe\nthe $c({\\rm M},z)$ relations from the power spectrum alone. The solid\ncurves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz} show the predictions of such a model,\nwhich we describe in more detail in Section~\\ref{sSec_model}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig5.pdf}\n  \\caption{Median mass profiles (solid lines) and collapsed mass histories,\n    ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$ (dot-dashed lines), for halos in three\n    separate mass bins (${\\rm M}_0=10^9$, $10^{10}$, and $10^{11}\\,\n    h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot$) after rescaling to the characteristic values of\n    mass, ${\\rm M}_{-2}={\\rm M}(<r_{-2})$, and density,\n    $\\rho_{-2}$.

This implies that halo\nconcentrations can be obtained by simply rescaling their mass accretion\nhistory by a fixed amount: the characteristic density of\n${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ is simply proportional to that of \n${\\rm M}(\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z))$. One consequence of this result is that\ntwo halos of\nsimilar MAH must have the same characteristic density and vice versa,\nindependent of their mass or identification redshift. This greatly\nsimplifies the task of predicting concentrations from assembly\nhistories when applied to CDM \\citep[see also][]{Correa2015c}.  In WDM\nmodels, however, the suppression of gravitational collapse below the\nfree-streaming scale breaks the scale-invariance of the assembly\nprocess: it imprints a preferred scale on the MAHs, readily seen in\nthe left-most panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_unscaled}. This implies\nthat the mass profiles of WDM halos {\\em cannot be obtained by simply\n  rescaling the MAHs of their main progenitors}.\n\nWe illustrate this in the upper panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:coco_mah},\nwhere we show the median main-progenitor MAHs, ${\\rm M}_{200}(z)$\n(solid lines), and the enclosed density profiles, ${\\rm\n  M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ (dashed lines), of \\textsc{coco-warm} halos\nfor two different halo masses and at two different redshifts. The halo\nmasses ($\\log {\\rm M}_{200}/[10^{10} h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot]=0.9$ and\n$\\log {\\rm M}_{200}/[10^{10} h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot]=-0.75$) were\nselected so that their median concentration is roughly the same\n($c\\approx 9.5$ at $z_0=0$, and $c\\approx 6.4$ at $z_0=1$), but fall\non opposite sides on the ``peak'' in the $c({\\rm M})$ relations.  To aid the\ncomparison, masses have been normalized to the current mass, ${\\rm\n  M}_0={\\rm M}(z_0)$, critical densities to $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$, and\nenclosed densities to $200\\, \\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$.\n\nThe dashed curves indicate that these halos not only have the same\n$c$, but also similar mass profiles across the entire resolved radial\nrange. The outsized symbols highlight the enclosed mass and mean\ndensity within $r=3\\times r_{-2}$, $r_{-2}$ and $r_{-2}/2$, which are\nroughly equivalent for both masses. For comparison, the solid red line\nshows an NFW profile with the same concentration.\n\nDespite the similarity of the halo mass profiles,\nit is clear from Fig.~\\ref{fig:coco_mah} that the {\\em shapes} of the\nMAHs of the two halos (solid lines) are substantially different. \nThe dot-dashed curve shows the MAH obtained by rescaling the NFW mass\nprofile, as described in L13 for CDM. This model describes quite\nwell the MAH of massive WDM halos, but fails dramatically at low\nmass, where the MAH shape differs substantially from NFW. The MAH of\nsuch halos cannot be used then to infer the concentration of their mass\nprofile in the same way as for CDM halos. \n\nAlternative descriptions of halo growth that preserve scale invariance\nmay improve matters. One possibility, mentioned in\nSection~\\ref{SecMAH}, is to use the mass, ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(f,z)$, in {\\em\n  all} progenitors (above a certain threshold $f\\times {\\rm M}_0$) rather\nthan just that of the main progenitor. The lower panels of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:coco_mah} show, for the same two halo masses, the growth\nof the total mass in progenitors more massive than 2 per cent of the\nhalo's final mass. The curves are now virtually indistinguishable,\nsuggesting that the collapsed mass in progenitors {\\em other} that the\nmain one plays an important role in establishing a halo mass profile.\nNote also that the shape of ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$ is accurately described\nby eq.~\\ref{eqMcoll}, shown in the lower panels using a dot-dashed\n(red) line after rescaling to match each of the halo formation\ntimes. This suggests that it may be possible to use the collapsed mass\nhistory, ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(f,z)$, to predict halo concentrations. \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_rescaled} shows that this is indeed the case,\nfor both CDM and WDM halos, regardless of mass or identification\nredshift. Here we compare the median ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$\n(dot-dashed lines), constructed using $f=0.02$ for halos of mass ${\\rm\n  M}_0=10^9$, $10^{10}$ and $10^{11} \\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot$ after\nrescaling each to the characteristic values of mass, ${\\rm\n  M}_{-2}={\\rm M}(<r_{-2})$, and density, $\\rho_{-2}$. \n\nDifferent panels show results for different identification redshifts,\nwith blue and orange curves distinguishing halos in the\n\\textsc{coco-cold} and \\textsc{coco-warm} runs, respectively.  As\nanticipated, each curve has a similar shape, independent of ${\\rm\n  M}_0$, $z_0$ or the shape of the DM power spectrum. Indeed, as\nalluded to above, the similarity of these curves is actually {\\em\n  expected} from EPS theory.  The dashed grey line in each panel of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_rescaled}, for example, shows eq.~\\ref{eqMcoll},\nwhich describes the shapes of these curves remarkably well.\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_rescaled} also shows the median enclosed\ndensity profiles, ${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$, for each set of\nhalos, again after normalizing to the characteristic values of ${\\rm\n  M}_{-2}$ and $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$. The solid grey line shows an\nEinasto profile with $\\alpha=0.18$.\n\nBecause both ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z))$ and\n${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ have self-similar (albeit distinct) shapes, a\nsingle scaling relation between characteristic density and formation\ntime is sufficient to anchor the two and to construct an analytic\nmodel for $c({\\rm M},z)$, provided that, for some fixed value of $f$, the\ncharacteristic density of the CMH is\nsimply proportional to that of the mass profile.\n\nWe show this in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho}, where we plot the\nmean enclosed density within the halo scale radius,\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=M_{-2}/(4/3)\\pi r_{-2}^3$, versus $\\rho_{\\rm\n  crit}(z_{-2})$, the critical density at the redshift $z_{-2}$ when\nthe enclosed mass was first assembled into progenitors more massive\nthan 2 per cent of ${\\rm M}_0$ (i.e., $f=0.02$).  Note that the linear scaling,\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=C\\times \\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$, between\nthese two densities is independent of both mass and identification\nredshift. More importantly, however, the zero-point of this relation\nis independent of the DM particle model: both \\textsc{coco-cold} and\n\\textsc{coco-warm} have $C\\approx 400$.  Note also that similar\nscalings can be found for characteristic densities measured within\ndifferent fractions of $r_{-2}$. This can be seen in the upper and\nlower panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho} which show the results of\nrepeating this calculation within $r_{-2}/2$ and $3\\times r_{-2}$,\nrespectively.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig6.png}\n  \\caption{Mean enclosed density within $r_{-2}$ (middle), \n    $r_{-2}/2$ (top) and $3\\times r_{-2}$ (bottom), versus the\n    critical density at the time when the mass enclosed by each of those radii\n    was first contained in progenitors more massive than $0.02\\times {\\rm M}_0$.\n    In each case, enclosed and critical densities have been scaled to \n    the current value, $\\rho_0=\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$.}\n  \\label{fig:rhorho}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig7.png}\n  \\caption{Concentration-mass relation for equilibrium halos at \n    $z_0=0$ in four runs which vary the background cosmological \n    parameters $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$ and $\\sigma_8$.

Encouragingly, the most recent generation of\nalgorithms accurately reproduce not only the evolution of the main\nprogenitor halo\n\\citep[e.g.][]{vandenBosch2002,Jiang2014b,Correa2015a,Correa2015b},\nbut the entire hierarchy of progenitors for both CDM\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Parkinson2008} and WDM \\citep[e.g.][]{Benson2013}\nfluctuation power-spectra.\n\nIn order to describe the {\\em average} relation between concentration,\nmass and redshift, we use analytic arguments based on EPS theory to\nconstruct a simple model. Following the procedure laid out by NFW, the\nmodel assumes that a halo's characteristic density reflects the\ncritical density of the Universe at a suitably-defined collapse\nredshift. NFW adopted $\\delta_c$ as the characteristic density\n(eq.~\\ref{eq:rho_nfw}), and defined the collapse redshift as the time\nwhen half the {\\it virial} mass of the halo was first contained in\nprogenitors more massive than some fraction $f$ of the final {\\it\n  virial} mass.  \n\nA simple modification to this procedure yields much better results\nwhich are applicable to both CDM and WDM initial power spectra. These\nmodifications identify the characteristic density with the mean inner\ndensity within the scale radius, $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$, rather\nthan $\\delta_c$, and the characteristic halo mass with ${\\rm M}_{-2}$ rather\nthan the virial mass.\n\nThe revised model assumes that $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$ is directly \nproportional to the critical density of the Universe at the collapse \nredshift, $z_{-2}$, given by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 30942, "prevtext": "\nover the radial range $r_{\\rm conv}<r<0.8\\, r_{200}$.

It is important to note, however, that relaxed\nhalos form a highly biased sub-sample of the full halo population, and\ntheir prevalence depends in non-trivial ways on both halo mass and on\nredshift \\citep[see, e.g.,][]{Neto2007,Power2012,Ludlow2012,Klypin2014,Angel2015}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig3.png}\n  \\caption{Mass-concentration-redshift relation for \\textsc{coco-cold}\n    (blue), \\textsc{coco-warm} (red), and \\textsc{color-1.5} (green).\n    Fits to individual halos are shown as coloured dots; heavy points\n    correspond to the best-fit relation derived from the {\\em stacked}\n    mass profiles of halos in equally-spaced logarithmic mass bins of\n    width $0.1$ dex.

Some authors reject halos whose spherically average\ndensity profiles are poorly described by their chosen fitting \nformulae \\citep[e.g.][]{Maccio2007,Maccio2008,Dutton2014}.\n\n\\citet{Neto2007} suggested a combination of three criteria that may be\nused to curtail halos whose mass profiles are most likely to deviate\nfrom smooth spherical averages. These include: (i) the centre-of-mass\noffset, $d_{\\rm off}<0.07$, (ii) the substructure mass fraction,\n$f_{\\rm sub}=M_{\\rm sub}(<r_{200})/{\\rm M}_{200}<0.1$, and (iii) the\nvirial ratio, $\\eta<1.35$. During a merger each of these quantities\nfluctuate in predictable ways: $d_{\\rm off}$, for example, traces the\ncentre-of-mass of a merging system about its densest core, providing\nan estimate of the accuracy with which the halo centre can be defined;\n$f_{\\rm sub}$ monitors the mass contribution from undigested mergers,\nwhile $\\eta$ is sensitive to fluctuations in the gravitational\npotential as orbital energy is dissipated into binding energy.  As\ndiscussed by \\citet{Ludlow2012} and also \\citet{Poole2015},\nmerger-driven oscillations in these quantities are out of sync, making\nit unlikely that a halo will simultaneously fail all three at any\npoint during a merger.\n\nAre these criteria sufficient to ensure removal of all unrelaxed\nhalos? Arguably not. Because of its resolution dependence, only halos\nwith well-resolved substructure populations are sensitive to\n$f_{\\rm sub}$. In simulations with uniform mass resolution (such as\nthose used in this work) the least resolved halos are also the most\nabundant; $f_{\\rm sub}$ is therefore a useful equilibrium statistic\nfor only the most massive, best-resolved systems. Furthermore, since\nDM halos are not truly isolated, the virial ratio should be corrected\nfor external forces and surface pressure terms \\citep[see, e.g.,][for\na discussion]{pooleg2006,KP2008,Klypin2014} and only then can it be\nused to meaningfully assess departures from equilibrium.\n\nBecause of these uncertainties we here adopt a simpler approach and\nuse the {\\em dynamical age} of a system as the primary diagnostic for\nequilibrium.  We assume that any halo whose main progenitor has more\nthan doubled in mass in under a crossing time cannot have had time to\nrelax to an equilibrium configuration. More specifically, we require\n$t_{50}{\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel > \\over \\sim \\;$}}} 1.25\\times t_{\\rm cross}$ as a minimal but necessary\ncondition for equilibrium. Here\n$t_{\\rm cross}\\equiv 2\\times r_{200}/{\\rm V}_{200}$ is the\ncharacteristic crossing time of a halo and $t_{50}$ is the lookback\nhalf-mass formation time of its main progenitor. This single\ncriterion, however, will only flag halos undergoing very rapid\naccretion or equal-mass mergers. For that reason, we additionally\nimpose the familiar criterion $d_{\\rm off}<0.1$ to cull the remainder\nof the population. We will see in Appendix~\\ref{AppComp} that\nimposing these criteria on MS halos results in a $c({\\rm M},z)$\nrelation that decreases monotonically with mass over the redshift\nrange probed by our simulations, removing the ``upturn'' in the\nconcentration of high-mass halos reported by \\citet{Klypin2011} \n(see \\citet{Ludlow2012} for further details).\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig4.pdf}\n  \\caption{Enclosed density profiles, ${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ (dashed\n    lines) and assembly histories (solid lines) for halos in\n    \\textsc{coco-warm} at redshift $z=0$ (left panels) and $z=1$\n    (right panels).

Unlike CDM, where concentrations increase monotonically with\ndecreasing mass, in WDM models the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation has a\ncharacteristic shape: it first increases with decreasing mass, but\nreaches a well-defined maximum before decreasing again towards lower\nmass. Note that in the 3.3 and 1.5 keV models studied here the mass\nscale at which the peak concentration is reached is roughly\nindependent of redshift. Note also that differences between WDM and\nCDM are already evident at mass scales substantially larger than the\nfree-streaming scale.  For example, the ``peak'' in the median\nconcentration of WDM halos occurs approximately {\\em two orders of\n  magnitude above the half-mode mass}, suggesting that differences in\nthe very early stages of halo growth leave a lasting imprint on the\nfinal halo. We highlight this point using coloured arrows, which \ncorrespond to {\\em one hundred times} the half-mode mass of each WDM run. \nThis provides an important clue for models that aim to fully describe\nthe $c({\\rm M},z)$ relations from the power spectrum alone. The solid\ncurves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz} show the predictions of such a model,\nwhich we describe in more detail in Section~\\ref{sSec_model}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig5.pdf}\n  \\caption{Median mass profiles (solid lines) and collapsed mass histories,\n    ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$ (dot-dashed lines), for halos in three\n    separate mass bins (${\\rm M}_0=10^9$, $10^{10}$, and $10^{11}\\,\n    h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot$) after rescaling to the characteristic values of\n    mass, ${\\rm M}_{-2}={\\rm M}(<r_{-2})$, and density,\n    $\\rho_{-2}$.

This implies that halo\nconcentrations can be obtained by simply rescaling their mass accretion\nhistory by a fixed amount: the characteristic density of\n${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ is simply proportional to that of \n${\\rm M}(\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z))$. One consequence of this result is that\ntwo halos of\nsimilar MAH must have the same characteristic density and vice versa,\nindependent of their mass or identification redshift. This greatly\nsimplifies the task of predicting concentrations from assembly\nhistories when applied to CDM \\citep[see also][]{Correa2015c}.  In WDM\nmodels, however, the suppression of gravitational collapse below the\nfree-streaming scale breaks the scale-invariance of the assembly\nprocess: it imprints a preferred scale on the MAHs, readily seen in\nthe left-most panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_unscaled}. This implies\nthat the mass profiles of WDM halos {\\em cannot be obtained by simply\n  rescaling the MAHs of their main progenitors}.\n\nWe illustrate this in the upper panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:coco_mah},\nwhere we show the median main-progenitor MAHs, ${\\rm M}_{200}(z)$\n(solid lines), and the enclosed density profiles, ${\\rm\n  M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ (dashed lines), of \\textsc{coco-warm} halos\nfor two different halo masses and at two different redshifts. The halo\nmasses ($\\log {\\rm M}_{200}/[10^{10} h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot]=0.9$ and\n$\\log {\\rm M}_{200}/[10^{10} h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot]=-0.75$) were\nselected so that their median concentration is roughly the same\n($c\\approx 9.5$ at $z_0=0$, and $c\\approx 6.4$ at $z_0=1$), but fall\non opposite sides on the ``peak'' in the $c({\\rm M})$ relations.  To aid the\ncomparison, masses have been normalized to the current mass, ${\\rm\n  M}_0={\\rm M}(z_0)$, critical densities to $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$, and\nenclosed densities to $200\\, \\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$.\n\nThe dashed curves indicate that these halos not only have the same\n$c$, but also similar mass profiles across the entire resolved radial\nrange. The outsized symbols highlight the enclosed mass and mean\ndensity within $r=3\\times r_{-2}$, $r_{-2}$ and $r_{-2}/2$, which are\nroughly equivalent for both masses. For comparison, the solid red line\nshows an NFW profile with the same concentration.\n\nDespite the similarity of the halo mass profiles,\nit is clear from Fig.~\\ref{fig:coco_mah} that the {\\em shapes} of the\nMAHs of the two halos (solid lines) are substantially different. \nThe dot-dashed curve shows the MAH obtained by rescaling the NFW mass\nprofile, as described in L13 for CDM. This model describes quite\nwell the MAH of massive WDM halos, but fails dramatically at low\nmass, where the MAH shape differs substantially from NFW. The MAH of\nsuch halos cannot be used then to infer the concentration of their mass\nprofile in the same way as for CDM halos. \n\nAlternative descriptions of halo growth that preserve scale invariance\nmay improve matters. One possibility, mentioned in\nSection~\\ref{SecMAH}, is to use the mass, ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(f,z)$, in {\\em\n  all} progenitors (above a certain threshold $f\\times {\\rm M}_0$) rather\nthan just that of the main progenitor. The lower panels of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:coco_mah} show, for the same two halo masses, the growth\nof the total mass in progenitors more massive than 2 per cent of the\nhalo's final mass. The curves are now virtually indistinguishable,\nsuggesting that the collapsed mass in progenitors {\\em other} that the\nmain one plays an important role in establishing a halo mass profile.\nNote also that the shape of ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$ is accurately described\nby eq.~\\ref{eqMcoll}, shown in the lower panels using a dot-dashed\n(red) line after rescaling to match each of the halo formation\ntimes. This suggests that it may be possible to use the collapsed mass\nhistory, ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(f,z)$, to predict halo concentrations. \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_rescaled} shows that this is indeed the case,\nfor both CDM and WDM halos, regardless of mass or identification\nredshift. Here we compare the median ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$\n(dot-dashed lines), constructed using $f=0.02$ for halos of mass ${\\rm\n  M}_0=10^9$, $10^{10}$ and $10^{11} \\, h^{-1} {\\rm M}_\\odot$ after\nrescaling each to the characteristic values of mass, ${\\rm\n  M}_{-2}={\\rm M}(<r_{-2})$, and density, $\\rho_{-2}$. \n\nDifferent panels show results for different identification redshifts,\nwith blue and orange curves distinguishing halos in the\n\\textsc{coco-cold} and \\textsc{coco-warm} runs, respectively.  As\nanticipated, each curve has a similar shape, independent of ${\\rm\n  M}_0$, $z_0$ or the shape of the DM power spectrum. Indeed, as\nalluded to above, the similarity of these curves is actually {\\em\n  expected} from EPS theory.  The dashed grey line in each panel of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_rescaled}, for example, shows eq.~\\ref{eqMcoll},\nwhich describes the shapes of these curves remarkably well.\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:mz_mrho_rescaled} also shows the median enclosed\ndensity profiles, ${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$, for each set of\nhalos, again after normalizing to the characteristic values of ${\\rm\n  M}_{-2}$ and $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$. The solid grey line shows an\nEinasto profile with $\\alpha=0.18$.\n\nBecause both ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z))$ and\n${\\rm M}(\\langle\\rho\\rangle)$ have self-similar (albeit distinct) shapes, a\nsingle scaling relation between characteristic density and formation\ntime is sufficient to anchor the two and to construct an analytic\nmodel for $c({\\rm M},z)$, provided that, for some fixed value of $f$, the\ncharacteristic density of the CMH is\nsimply proportional to that of the mass profile.\n\nWe show this in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho}, where we plot the\nmean enclosed density within the halo scale radius,\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=M_{-2}/(4/3)\\pi r_{-2}^3$, versus $\\rho_{\\rm\n  crit}(z_{-2})$, the critical density at the redshift $z_{-2}$ when\nthe enclosed mass was first assembled into progenitors more massive\nthan 2 per cent of ${\\rm M}_0$ (i.e., $f=0.02$).  Note that the linear scaling,\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=C\\times \\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$, between\nthese two densities is independent of both mass and identification\nredshift. More importantly, however, the zero-point of this relation\nis independent of the DM particle model: both \\textsc{coco-cold} and\n\\textsc{coco-warm} have $C\\approx 400$.  Note also that similar\nscalings can be found for characteristic densities measured within\ndifferent fractions of $r_{-2}$. This can be seen in the upper and\nlower panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho} which show the results of\nrepeating this calculation within $r_{-2}/2$ and $3\\times r_{-2}$,\nrespectively.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig6.png}\n  \\caption{Mean enclosed density within $r_{-2}$ (middle), \n    $r_{-2}/2$ (top) and $3\\times r_{-2}$ (bottom), versus the\n    critical density at the time when the mass enclosed by each of those radii\n    was first contained in progenitors more massive than $0.02\\times {\\rm M}_0$.\n    In each case, enclosed and critical densities have been scaled to \n    the current value, $\\rho_0=\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$.}\n  \\label{fig:rhorho}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig7.png}\n  \\caption{Concentration-mass relation for equilibrium halos at \n    $z_0=0$ in four runs which vary the background cosmological \n    parameters $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$ and $\\sigma_8$.

Encouragingly, the most recent generation of\nalgorithms accurately reproduce not only the evolution of the main\nprogenitor halo\n\\citep[e.g.][]{vandenBosch2002,Jiang2014b,Correa2015a,Correa2015b},\nbut the entire hierarchy of progenitors for both CDM\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Parkinson2008} and WDM \\citep[e.g.][]{Benson2013}\nfluctuation power-spectra.\n\nIn order to describe the {\\em average} relation between concentration,\nmass and redshift, we use analytic arguments based on EPS theory to\nconstruct a simple model. Following the procedure laid out by NFW, the\nmodel assumes that a halo's characteristic density reflects the\ncritical density of the Universe at a suitably-defined collapse\nredshift. NFW adopted $\\delta_c$ as the characteristic density\n(eq.~\\ref{eq:rho_nfw}), and defined the collapse redshift as the time\nwhen half the {\\it virial} mass of the halo was first contained in\nprogenitors more massive than some fraction $f$ of the final {\\it\n  virial} mass.  \n\nA simple modification to this procedure yields much better results\nwhich are applicable to both CDM and WDM initial power spectra. These\nmodifications identify the characteristic density with the mean inner\ndensity within the scale radius, $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$, rather\nthan $\\delta_c$, and the characteristic halo mass with ${\\rm M}_{-2}$ rather\nthan the virial mass.\n\nThe revised model assumes that $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$ is directly \nproportional to the critical density of the Universe at the collapse \nredshift, $z_{-2}$, given by\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\frac{\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle}{\\rho_0} \\equiv C\\times\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm\n      crit}(z_{-2})}{\\rho_0}= C\\times \\biggr[\\frac{H(z_{-2})}{H(z_0)}\\biggl]^2.\n  \\label{eq:rho_scaling}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle}{\\rho_{0}}\\equiv C\\times\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_%&#10;{-2})}{\\rho_{0}}=C\\times\\biggr{[}\\frac{H(z_{-2})}{H(z_{0})}\\biggl{]}^{2}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2261</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>crit</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u00d7</mo><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">[</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>z</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>z</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><msup><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">]</mo><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02624.tex", "nexttext": "\nNote that the left-hand sides of eqs~\\ref{eq:rho_scaling} and \\ref{eq:PS} depend\nonly on the halo mass profile; once $f$ and $C$ have been specified,\nand the shape of the mass profile assumed, these equations can \nbe solved simultaneously for the concentration as a function of mass, \n${\\rm M}_0$, redshift, $z_0$, and its dependence on power spectrum through\n$\\sigma({\\rm M})$\\footnote{Throughout the paper we calculate $\\sigma({\\rm M})$\n  from the linear power spectrum using a real-space spherical top-hat\n  filter.

We show\nthis in Fig.~\\ref{fig:vmax_rmax} where we compare the $V_{\\rm\n  max}$-$r_{\\rm max}$ relation (equivalent to the mass-concentration\nrelation) for field halos in the high-resolution region of the\nAquarius simulations of \\citet{Lovell2014}. These runs follow the\nevolution of Milky Way-mass dark matter halos and their immediate\nsurroundings in CDM and a series of WDM models with thermal particle\nmasses of $\\approx \\,$1.5, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.3 keV.  We plot here\nisolated halos, defined as main halos that are farther than two virial\nradii from the largest halo in the simulation.

These\ncurves accurately describe the systematic shift in concentration\nbrought about by changes to the properties of the DM particle. The\ngood agreement between model and simulation implies that our model\nprovides a useful theoretical tool for studies aiming to constrain the\nnature of dark matter based on its imprint on the internal structure\nof low-mass halos.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig9.pdf}\n  \\caption{Comparison of the predicted and measured concentrations for\n    equilibrium halos with ${\\rm N}_{200}\\geq 10^4$ particles in the \n    \\textsc{coco-cold} (left) and \\textsc{coco-warm} (right)\n    simulations.

For WDM\nhalos of the same mass and redshift, the reductions are $\\sim 80$\nand $\\sim 50$ per cent, respectively. Thus, the scatter in collapse\ntime does not fully account for the scatter in concentration. Future\nstudies should assess the role of environment or initial conditions in \nestablishing the mass profiles of DM halos. \n\n\\subsection{Comparison to previous work}\n\\label{sSec_model_comp}\n\nStudies aimed at providing theoretical predictions for the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation have traditionally\nfollowed one of two routes. One class of models aims to connect the \nstructural properties of halos to some aspect of their assembly history\n\\citep{Bullock2001,Eke2001,Wechsler2002,Zhao2003a,Lu2006,Maccio2008,Ludlow2014,Correa2015c}, \nmost commonly by relating their characteristic\ndensities to the mean or background density at some appropriately\ndefined formation time. Other methods devise fitting formulae of\nvarying complexity that are then calibrated to the results of\nnumerical simulations over some range of halo mass and redshift \n\\citep{Prada2012,Dutton2014,Klypin2014,Diemer2015}. \n\nEach of these methods have their own virtues and\nweaknesses. Parametrized fits to simulation results, for example,\ngenerally yield simple and compact formulae that accurately describe \nthe scaling relations between halo structural properties, but must be \ntreated with caution when extrapolated outside the range of halo mass,\nredshift or cosmological parameters for which they were determined. \nPhysically motivated models, however, attempt to link halo structure to some\naspect of their assembly. As a result they are often more cumbersome, \nbut arguably provide more reliable extrapolations of these relations.  \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_fits} we compare the predictions of our model \n(thin solid lines repeated in each panel) for\nthe Planck cosmology with several empirical fits proposed in the\nliterature (dashed lines). Different colours correspond to\ndifferent redshifts -- $z_0=0$, 1, 2, and 3 -- and all curves have \nbeen extrapolated down to $\\sim 10^{-8} \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot$ \nto emphasize their differences.\n\nEach model was calibrated, at $z=0$, for masses \n$10^{10}{\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}} {\\rm {\\rm M}_{200}}/[h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot]{\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}}\n10^{15}$ and, over that range, provide consistent\npredictions for the $c({\\rm M})$ relation. Note, however, that the models \nshow a larger variation at higher redshift, even over the mass \nscales at which they were calibrated. This reflects the fact that \neach group of authors used different equilibrium conditions (or none \nat all in the case of \\citet{Diemer2015} and \\citet{Prada2012}) to \ndefine their halo samples, which can introduce subtle biases in the \nrecovered $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation, particularly at high redshift \n\\citep{Ludlow2012,Angel2015}.\n\nMore importantly, however, these models fail to account for \nthe effects of CDM free-streaming on halos of the smallest mass. \nThis is shown in the lower-right panel, where the dashed lines\nshow the effect of a 100 GeV neutralino CDM particle relative to \npure CDM (solid lines) on the predicted $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation \n(we model the neutralino transfer function according to \n\\citet{Green2004}). Note that the concentrations of neutralino \nhalos peak at approximately 60 Earth masses, shown here\nusing a downward pointing arrow. Regardless of\nthe substructure mass function below this limit, the reduced\nconcentration of halos will substantially reduce the ``clumpiness''\nof matter on scales comparable to Earth's mass and smaller. This\nmay have important implications for direct or indirect dark matter\ndetection experiments.\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\\label{SecConc}\n\nWe have analyzed the mass profiles and formation histories of a large\nsample of equilibrium dark matter halos extracted from an ensemble of \ncosmological N-body simulations. These include the Copernicus Complexio\nsimulations, the Millennium and Aquarius simulations and an additional\nset of runs with differing density fluctuation amplitudes and dark\nmatter content. Our simulation suite includes both CDM and \nWDM runs, allowing us to assess the dependence of\nhalo concentrations on cosmological parameters and on the shape of the\nlinear matter power spectrum. Below we summarize our main results. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item In agreement with previous work, we find that the spherically\n  averaged density profiles of CDM and WDM halos are approximately\n  universal and are accurately described by the NFW or Einasto\n  profile, regardless of the shape of the density fluctuation power\n  spectrum. The main difference between CDM and truncated power\n  spectra, such as WDM, is the mass-concentration-redshift\n  relation of equilibrium halos.\n\n\\item The concentrations of CDM halos, at fixed $z$, decrease\n  monotonically with increasing halo mass. At fixed mass,\n  concentrations decrease monotonically with increasing redshift. We\n  find no evidence for departures from this trend amongst our relaxed\n  sample, providing further evidence that the recently reported\n  ``upturn'' in the concentrations of rare, massive halos results from\n  the inclusion of unrelaxed systems in the sample \\citep[see,\n  e.g.][for details]{Ludlow2012}. \n\n\\item The WDM $c({\\rm M})$ relation, on the other hand, is\n  non-monotonic. At given $z$, concentrations peak at a multiple of\n  the half-mode mass scale imposed by the power spectrum\n  truncation. Concentrations decline above and below that peak mass\n  scale (which seems to be independent of redshift) over the full mass\n  range probed by the simulations.\n\n\\item The main-progenitor mass accretion histories (MAH) of CDM halos\n  are scale-free, and resemble the NFW shape when cast in terms of\n  mass and critical density, rather than mass and time. The\n  concentration of a CDM halo can therefore be inferred from a simple\n  scaling of its MAH. A simple model based on this feature accounts\n  successfully for the main properties of the CDM\n  mass-concentration-redshift relations.\n\n\\item The ``free-streaming'' truncation of the WDM linear power\n  spectrum results in substantial delay and suppression of structure\n  formation below a certain mass scale. This breaks the similarity of\n  main-progenitor mass accretion histories, whose shape now depends\n  critically on halo mass. Low-mass WDM halos near the truncation\n  scale tend to form quickly and monolithically. Massive WDM halos, on\n  the other hand, form just like their CDM counterparts. The strong\n  dependence on halo mass of the MAH shape precludes the application\n  of the same model developed to infer CDM halo concentrations from their\n  MAHs.\n\n\\item A simple extension of the model, however, provides an excellent\n  description of the mass-concentration-redshift relation for both CDM\n  and WDM halos. The extension relies on using the full ``collapsed\n  mass history'' of a halo (i.e., ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$, the total mass in\n  collapsed structures at given time) rather than just its main\n  progenitor. Collapsed mass fractions are approximately scale-free,\n  which implies that a simple model may be devised in order to infer\n  halo concentrations directly from ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$. This model\n  reproduces well the mass-concentration-redshift relation in all our\n  simulations, CDM and WDM alike, over the whole range of halo masses\n  and redshifts probed. Applied to CDM, this model may be used to extrapolate $c({\\rm\n    M},z)$ to very low masses, where the relation departs strikingly\n  from a pure power-law and differs also from the predictions of earlier models.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe provide upon request a simple code that computes the predicted $c({\\rm M},z)$\nrelations for CDM and WDM power spectra with arbitrary free-streaming\ntruncation masses. This should be useful for extrapolating the results\nwe show here to halo masses and redshifts not well resolved by our\nsimulations. Such extensions may be important, especially when\nevaluating predictions of these models for indirect and direct dark\nmatter detection strategies.\n\n\\section*{acknowledgments}\n\nWe thank Mark Lovell for useful conversations and for allowing us to\nuse the Aquarius data shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:vmax_rmax}.\nADL is supported by a COFUND Junior Research Fellowship.

For all models we have assumed a WMAP-1\n    cosmology. Coloured symbols show the median $c({\\rm M},z)$\n    relations obtained for equilibrium halos in the Millennium\n    simulations. Lines and symbols have been coloured according to\n    redshift, as indicated in the legend.}\n  \\label{fig:cmz_models}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_models} we compare the predictions of the model\ndescribed in Section~\\ref{sSec_model} to three common analytic recipes\nto compute $c({\\rm M},z)$ \\citep{Bullock2001,Gao2008,Correa2015c} Each\nmodel adopts a WMAP-1-normalized cosmology, and its predictions \nare compared to the median $c({\\rm M},z)$ relations obtained for relaxed\nhalos in the MS runs.\n\nAll three analytic prescriptions considered here agree reasonably well\nwith our results at $z=0$. The \\citet{Bullock2001} model, including\nmodifications suggested by \\citet{Maccio2008} (left panel), deviates\nby less than $\\sim 5\\%$ at any mass scale ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}} 10^{15}\\, h^{-1}\\,\n{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.  This model predicts a simple redshift-dependence at fixed\nmass, $c\\propto (1+z)^{-1}$, which, at low masses (${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}} 10^{10}\\,\nh^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), agrees well with our findings. At higher mass,\nhowever, it predicts a sharp decline that is inconsistent with the\nresults of the Millennium simulations. \nFor WDM halos this model predicts halo concentrations that increase\nmonotonically with decreasing mass, approaching a constant for masses\nbelow the free-streaming scale (this is because Bullock et al define\nformation times using $D(z_c)\\sigma(F\\, {\\rm M}_0)=1.686$ which, for \nWDM, predicts a constant $z_c$ for ${\\rm M}\\ll {\\rm M}_{\\rm fs}$). \nClearly this is not supported by the data in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz}.\n\nThe modifications of the NFW model proposed by \\citet{Gao2008} results\nin concentration estimates that are similar, but not identical to the\npredictions of the model we propose.  The original NFW model has three\nfree parameters: two physical parameters, $F$ and $f$, and a scaling\nfactor $C$ that relates the characteristic density of a halo to the\nbackground density at its formation time. The formation time\ncorresponds to the time which a fraction $F$ of the halo's final mass,\n${\\rm M}_0$, was first assembled into progenitors each at least as\nmassive as $f\\times {\\rm M}_0$.\n\nNFW chose $F=0.5$, $f=0.01$, and $C=3000$, whereas Gao et al found improved fits to the\nMillennium simulation by choosing $F=0.1$, $f=0.01$ and $C=600$. \nOur proposal instead relates $F$ to the characteristic mass of the\nhalo, i.e. $F\\equiv {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M_0}$; it adopts $f=0.02$ and $C=650$. We\ncompare the NFW predictions for these parameter choices \nin the middle panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_models}.\n\nNote that defining $F\\equiv {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$ reduces the number of model \nparameters while at the same\ntime improves the agreement with the simulation results. Note also,\nthat the Gao et al model is expected to fare increasingly poorly at mass\nscales for which it predicts concentrations for which ${\\rm\n  M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0\\ll$ or $\\gg$0.1. As a result, we\nexpect extrapolations of the Gao et al model to very low or very high mass\nscales to become increasingly different. We provide a more detailed\ndiscussion of the importance of the parameters $F$ and $f$ in Appendix\n\\ref{AppModel}.\n\nThe analytic predictions of \\citet{Correa2015c}, shown \nin the right-hand panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_models}, also agree\nwell with our results. Like L14, this model relates\nthe characteristic density of a halo to the critical density at the \nredshift when its main progenitor had first assembled the\ncharacteristic mass, ${\\rm M}_{-2}$. The agreement is therefore not \nsurprising, as their model is based \nexplicitly on the results L14, which we deliberately\nreproduce using our new methodology. Indeed, the slight differences\nbetween the predictions of \\citet{Correa2015c} and our own can be \nattributed to changes brought about by replacing Einasto fits with the NFW\nfits upon which their model was calibrated. Note, however, that the\nmodel of L14 (and Correa et al) fails when applied to WDM power\nspectra because free-streaming modifies the proportionality constant\nbetween the characteristic density of a halo and the critical density\nat their particular choice of the collapse time. \n\n\\section{Parameter-dependence of the characteristic density-formation time relation}\n\\label{AppModel}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{./plots/FigA2.png}\n  \\caption{Mean enclosed density, \n    $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$, within the best-fitting scale radius,\n    $r_{-2}$, versus the critical density at \n    the redshift $z_F$ at which a fraction $F$ of the halo mass, ${\\rm M}_0$,\n    was first contained in \n    progenitors more massive than $0.02\\times {\\rm M}_0$.

The scaling\nrelations in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho} indicate that the value of $C$ will\ndepend sensitively on the precise definition of ``characteristic density''. If \ndefined to be $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$, the mean density within\n$r_{-2}$, then $C=400$. If, however, the characteristic density is\ndefined as that within $\\sim 3\\times r_{-2}$ then $C\\approx 200$ describes\nour numerical results quite well. Note that this is precisely what \nis expected from the spherical tophat collapse model. The simplest\ninterpretation of the parameter $C$ therefore is that it represents \nthe contraction of the inner halo beyond what is expected from simple \nspherical collapse. Lacking a theoretical model to provide deeper \ninsight, its numerical value must be calibrated using simulations,\nand may exhibit subtle dependencies on the precise definition of halo mass\nused. \n\nThe success (of lack thereof) of previous attempts by NFW and Gao et al \nto model the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation using using methods similar to ours\ncan be traced to each authors different definition of ``formation time''. \nBoth NFW and Gao et al assumed that a halo had ``formed'' when a fraction \n$F$ of its final mass had first assembled into clumps more massive than\na smaller fraction $f \\ll F$ of the same mass. Each of these parameters\naffects the precise value of $z_f$. NFW assumed $F=0.5$, Gao et al $F=0.1$,\nand both found $f=0.01$ as a suitable progenitor mass threshold.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho_F}, we plot the mean enclosed density within\nthe halo scale radius, $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=M_{-2}/(4/3)\\pi r_{-2}^3$, \nversus $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{F})$, the critical density \nat the redshift $z_{F}$ when the total collapsed mass first\nexceeded $F\\times M_0$. Different panels\nshow results for different values of $F$, and all assume \na small progenitor threshold, $f=0.02$. The points\ncorresponds to averages over single mass bins, and are shown for all four\nidentification redshifts after normalizing densities by the \ncritical value at $z_0$, $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$. Note that only mass\nbins corresponding to halos with ${\\rm N}_{200}\\geq 10^4$ are plotted, which\nensures that all progenitors are resolved with at least 100 particles.\n\nAlthough all values of $F$ (which span a factor of 50)\nresult in a tight linear relation between the two densities, \nonly the particular choice $F= {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$ provides a direct proportionality between\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$ and $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$ (the thin grey\nlines each each panel, for example, show the direct scaling\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=400\\times\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$, which\nprovides a reasonable description of the data only for $F= {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$).\nAll other values result in \nsteeper slopes that gradually shallow as $F$ is decreased but , even \nfor $F=0.01$, do not reach the natural linear scaling.\n\nFormation times also depend on the progenitor mass threshold, $f$. Previous\nstudies have hinted at puzzlingly small values: $f=0.01$ in the \ncase of NFW and Gao et al; $f=0.02$ in our case. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho_f}\nwe show how the mean characteristic density, $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$,\nof halos varies as a function of the redshift at which their characteristic mass,\n${\\rm M}_{-2}$, had first assembled into clumps each larger than $f\\times {\\rm M}_0$. \nNote that high values of $f$ (e.g. $f=0.5$, shown in the lower-right\npanel) result in steep power law slopes. Decreasing $f$ shifts all\nformation times to higher redshift, but the magnitude of the shift\ndepends on $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$. The net result,\nprovided $f$ becomes sufficiently small, provides a natural correspondence\nbetween characteristic density and the background density at the halo \nformation time. Note also that, at least in the CDM case, the precise\nvalues of $f$ seems unimportant, provided it is ``small enough'' (e.g.\n$f=0.005$, 0.01 and 0.02 all result in scaling relations whose slopes\ndo not deviate noticeably from one). As a rule of thumb, we suspect\nthat values of $f\\ll {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$, of order a few per cent,\nwill yield robust results.\n\n\nOverall, we find that for $F={\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$ and $f\\approx 0.02$, the linear scaling, \n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=C\\times \\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$, \nbetween these two densities is independent of both mass and\nidentification redshift. More importantly, however,\nthe zero-point of this relation is independent of the DM particle model:\nboth \\textsc{coco-cold} and \\textsc{coco-warm} have $C\\approx 400$. \nWe therefore advocate the use of these parameters in future modelling,\nbut acknowledge that better data, alternative halo definitions, or\nor a different variety of DM models may result in modifications.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{plots/FigA4.pdf}\n  \\caption{Predicted $c({\\rm M},z)$ relations for different\n    density profiles.

Note that these are the same parameters used to fit the\n$c({\\rm M},z)$ relations in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz}, which were obtained\nfrom simulations of a WMAP-7 cosmological model.\n\nA further test of the model involves its extrapolation to much lower\nhalo masses than can be resolved in \\textsc{coco-cold} and \\textsc{coco-warm}. We show\nthis in Fig.~\\ref{fig:vmax_rmax} where we compare the $V_{\\rm\n  max}$-$r_{\\rm max}$ relation (equivalent to the mass-concentration\nrelation) for field halos in the high-resolution region of the\nAquarius simulations of \\citet{Lovell2014}. These runs follow the\nevolution of Milky Way-mass dark matter halos and their immediate\nsurroundings in CDM and a series of WDM models with thermal particle\nmasses of $\\approx \\,$1.5, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.3 keV.  We plot here\nisolated halos, defined as main halos that are farther than two virial\nradii from the largest halo in the simulation. This selection ensures\nthat systems previously accreted and expelled from the most massive\nhalo in the simulation are excluded from the analysis\n\\citep[see][]{Ludlow2009}. Grey dots show the ${\\rm V}_{\\rm max}-r_{\\rm\n  max}$ relation obtained from the CDM run; coloured symbols show the\nresults for the various WDM models, as indicated in the legend.\n\nThe predictions of the analytic model described above are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:vmax_rmax} for all DM models considered. As in previous\nplots, we compute each curve for $C=650$ and $f=0.02$; line and symbol\ncolours were chosen to match the corresponding simulations. These\ncurves accurately describe the systematic shift in concentration\nbrought about by changes to the properties of the DM particle. The\ngood agreement between model and simulation implies that our model\nprovides a useful theoretical tool for studies aiming to constrain the\nnature of dark matter based on its imprint on the internal structure\nof low-mass halos.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig9.pdf}\n  \\caption{Comparison of the predicted and measured concentrations for\n    equilibrium halos with ${\\rm N}_{200}\\geq 10^4$ particles in the \n    \\textsc{coco-cold} (left) and \\textsc{coco-warm} (right)\n    simulations.

This\nfigure makes clear that our procedure faithfully reproduces the\nconcentrations of relaxed halos. The rms scatter about the one-to-one\nline, for example, is typically less than $\\sim$0.09, indicating that the\nerror on the predicted value of $c$ is less than $\\sim$23 per cent.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth]{./plots/Fig10.pdf}\n  \\caption{Comparison of the mass-concentration-redshift relation \n    in the Planck cosmology to those of: 1) \\citet{Prada2012} (upper-left);\n    2) \\citet{Diemer2015} (upper-right), and 3) \\citet{Dutton2014}\n    (lower-left).

For WDM\nhalos of the same mass and redshift, the reductions are $\\sim 80$\nand $\\sim 50$ per cent, respectively. Thus, the scatter in collapse\ntime does not fully account for the scatter in concentration. Future\nstudies should assess the role of environment or initial conditions in \nestablishing the mass profiles of DM halos. \n\n\\subsection{Comparison to previous work}\n\\label{sSec_model_comp}\n\nStudies aimed at providing theoretical predictions for the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation have traditionally\nfollowed one of two routes. One class of models aims to connect the \nstructural properties of halos to some aspect of their assembly history\n\\citep{Bullock2001,Eke2001,Wechsler2002,Zhao2003a,Lu2006,Maccio2008,Ludlow2014,Correa2015c}, \nmost commonly by relating their characteristic\ndensities to the mean or background density at some appropriately\ndefined formation time. Other methods devise fitting formulae of\nvarying complexity that are then calibrated to the results of\nnumerical simulations over some range of halo mass and redshift \n\\citep{Prada2012,Dutton2014,Klypin2014,Diemer2015}. \n\nEach of these methods have their own virtues and\nweaknesses. Parametrized fits to simulation results, for example,\ngenerally yield simple and compact formulae that accurately describe \nthe scaling relations between halo structural properties, but must be \ntreated with caution when extrapolated outside the range of halo mass,\nredshift or cosmological parameters for which they were determined. \nPhysically motivated models, however, attempt to link halo structure to some\naspect of their assembly. As a result they are often more cumbersome, \nbut arguably provide more reliable extrapolations of these relations.  \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_fits} we compare the predictions of our model \n(thin solid lines repeated in each panel) for\nthe Planck cosmology with several empirical fits proposed in the\nliterature (dashed lines). Different colours correspond to\ndifferent redshifts -- $z_0=0$, 1, 2, and 3 -- and all curves have \nbeen extrapolated down to $\\sim 10^{-8} \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot$ \nto emphasize their differences.\n\nEach model was calibrated, at $z=0$, for masses \n$10^{10}{\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}} {\\rm {\\rm M}_{200}}/[h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot]{\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}}\n10^{15}$ and, over that range, provide consistent\npredictions for the $c({\\rm M})$ relation. Note, however, that the models \nshow a larger variation at higher redshift, even over the mass \nscales at which they were calibrated. This reflects the fact that \neach group of authors used different equilibrium conditions (or none \nat all in the case of \\citet{Diemer2015} and \\citet{Prada2012}) to \ndefine their halo samples, which can introduce subtle biases in the \nrecovered $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation, particularly at high redshift \n\\citep{Ludlow2012,Angel2015}.\n\nMore importantly, however, these models fail to account for \nthe effects of CDM free-streaming on halos of the smallest mass. \nThis is shown in the lower-right panel, where the dashed lines\nshow the effect of a 100 GeV neutralino CDM particle relative to \npure CDM (solid lines) on the predicted $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation \n(we model the neutralino transfer function according to \n\\citet{Green2004}). Note that the concentrations of neutralino \nhalos peak at approximately 60 Earth masses, shown here\nusing a downward pointing arrow. Regardless of\nthe substructure mass function below this limit, the reduced\nconcentration of halos will substantially reduce the ``clumpiness''\nof matter on scales comparable to Earth's mass and smaller. This\nmay have important implications for direct or indirect dark matter\ndetection experiments.\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\\label{SecConc}\n\nWe have analyzed the mass profiles and formation histories of a large\nsample of equilibrium dark matter halos extracted from an ensemble of \ncosmological N-body simulations. These include the Copernicus Complexio\nsimulations, the Millennium and Aquarius simulations and an additional\nset of runs with differing density fluctuation amplitudes and dark\nmatter content. Our simulation suite includes both CDM and \nWDM runs, allowing us to assess the dependence of\nhalo concentrations on cosmological parameters and on the shape of the\nlinear matter power spectrum. Below we summarize our main results. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\n\\item In agreement with previous work, we find that the spherically\n  averaged density profiles of CDM and WDM halos are approximately\n  universal and are accurately described by the NFW or Einasto\n  profile, regardless of the shape of the density fluctuation power\n  spectrum. The main difference between CDM and truncated power\n  spectra, such as WDM, is the mass-concentration-redshift\n  relation of equilibrium halos.\n\n\\item The concentrations of CDM halos, at fixed $z$, decrease\n  monotonically with increasing halo mass. At fixed mass,\n  concentrations decrease monotonically with increasing redshift. We\n  find no evidence for departures from this trend amongst our relaxed\n  sample, providing further evidence that the recently reported\n  ``upturn'' in the concentrations of rare, massive halos results from\n  the inclusion of unrelaxed systems in the sample \\citep[see,\n  e.g.][for details]{Ludlow2012}. \n\n\\item The WDM $c({\\rm M})$ relation, on the other hand, is\n  non-monotonic. At given $z$, concentrations peak at a multiple of\n  the half-mode mass scale imposed by the power spectrum\n  truncation. Concentrations decline above and below that peak mass\n  scale (which seems to be independent of redshift) over the full mass\n  range probed by the simulations.\n\n\\item The main-progenitor mass accretion histories (MAH) of CDM halos\n  are scale-free, and resemble the NFW shape when cast in terms of\n  mass and critical density, rather than mass and time. The\n  concentration of a CDM halo can therefore be inferred from a simple\n  scaling of its MAH. A simple model based on this feature accounts\n  successfully for the main properties of the CDM\n  mass-concentration-redshift relations.\n\n\\item The ``free-streaming'' truncation of the WDM linear power\n  spectrum results in substantial delay and suppression of structure\n  formation below a certain mass scale. This breaks the similarity of\n  main-progenitor mass accretion histories, whose shape now depends\n  critically on halo mass. Low-mass WDM halos near the truncation\n  scale tend to form quickly and monolithically. Massive WDM halos, on\n  the other hand, form just like their CDM counterparts. The strong\n  dependence on halo mass of the MAH shape precludes the application\n  of the same model developed to infer CDM halo concentrations from their\n  MAHs.\n\n\\item A simple extension of the model, however, provides an excellent\n  description of the mass-concentration-redshift relation for both CDM\n  and WDM halos. The extension relies on using the full ``collapsed\n  mass history'' of a halo (i.e., ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$, the total mass in\n  collapsed structures at given time) rather than just its main\n  progenitor. Collapsed mass fractions are approximately scale-free,\n  which implies that a simple model may be devised in order to infer\n  halo concentrations directly from ${\\rm M}_{\\rm coll}(z)$. This model\n  reproduces well the mass-concentration-redshift relation in all our\n  simulations, CDM and WDM alike, over the whole range of halo masses\n  and redshifts probed. Applied to CDM, this model may be used to extrapolate $c({\\rm\n    M},z)$ to very low masses, where the relation departs strikingly\n  from a pure power-law and differs also from the predictions of earlier models.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe provide upon request a simple code that computes the predicted $c({\\rm M},z)$\nrelations for CDM and WDM power spectra with arbitrary free-streaming\ntruncation masses. This should be useful for extrapolating the results\nwe show here to halo masses and redshifts not well resolved by our\nsimulations. Such extensions may be important, especially when\nevaluating predictions of these models for indirect and direct dark\nmatter detection strategies.\n\n\\section*{acknowledgments}\n\nWe thank Mark Lovell for useful conversations and for allowing us to\nuse the Aquarius data shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:vmax_rmax}.\nADL is supported by a COFUND Junior Research Fellowship.

Lines and symbols have been coloured according to\n    redshift, as indicated in the legend.}\n  \\label{fig:cmz_models}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_models} we compare the predictions of the model\ndescribed in Section~\\ref{sSec_model} to three common analytic recipes\nto compute $c({\\rm M},z)$ \\citep{Bullock2001,Gao2008,Correa2015c} Each\nmodel adopts a WMAP-1-normalized cosmology, and its predictions \nare compared to the median $c({\\rm M},z)$ relations obtained for relaxed\nhalos in the MS runs.\n\nAll three analytic prescriptions considered here agree reasonably well\nwith our results at $z=0$. The \\citet{Bullock2001} model, including\nmodifications suggested by \\citet{Maccio2008} (left panel), deviates\nby less than $\\sim 5\\%$ at any mass scale ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}} 10^{15}\\, h^{-1}\\,\n{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.  This model predicts a simple redshift-dependence at fixed\nmass, $c\\propto (1+z)^{-1}$, which, at low masses (${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}} 10^{10}\\,\nh^{-1} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), agrees well with our findings. At higher mass,\nhowever, it predicts a sharp decline that is inconsistent with the\nresults of the Millennium simulations. \nFor WDM halos this model predicts halo concentrations that increase\nmonotonically with decreasing mass, approaching a constant for masses\nbelow the free-streaming scale (this is because Bullock et al define\nformation times using $D(z_c)\\sigma(F\\, {\\rm M}_0)=1.686$ which, for \nWDM, predicts a constant $z_c$ for ${\\rm M}\\ll {\\rm M}_{\\rm fs}$). \nClearly this is not supported by the data in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz}.\n\nThe modifications of the NFW model proposed by \\citet{Gao2008} results\nin concentration estimates that are similar, but not identical to the\npredictions of the model we propose.  The original NFW model has three\nfree parameters: two physical parameters, $F$ and $f$, and a scaling\nfactor $C$ that relates the characteristic density of a halo to the\nbackground density at its formation time. The formation time\ncorresponds to the time which a fraction $F$ of the halo's final mass,\n${\\rm M}_0$, was first assembled into progenitors each at least as\nmassive as $f\\times {\\rm M}_0$.\n\nNFW chose $F=0.5$, $f=0.01$, and $C=3000$, whereas Gao et al found improved fits to the\nMillennium simulation by choosing $F=0.1$, $f=0.01$ and $C=600$. \nOur proposal instead relates $F$ to the characteristic mass of the\nhalo, i.e. $F\\equiv {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M_0}$; it adopts $f=0.02$ and $C=650$. We\ncompare the NFW predictions for these parameter choices \nin the middle panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_models}.\n\nNote that defining $F\\equiv {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$ reduces the number of model \nparameters while at the same\ntime improves the agreement with the simulation results. Note also,\nthat the Gao et al model is expected to fare increasingly poorly at mass\nscales for which it predicts concentrations for which ${\\rm\n  M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0\\ll$ or $\\gg$0.1. As a result, we\nexpect extrapolations of the Gao et al model to very low or very high mass\nscales to become increasingly different. We provide a more detailed\ndiscussion of the importance of the parameters $F$ and $f$ in Appendix\n\\ref{AppModel}.\n\nThe analytic predictions of \\citet{Correa2015c}, shown \nin the right-hand panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_models}, also agree\nwell with our results. Like L14, this model relates\nthe characteristic density of a halo to the critical density at the \nredshift when its main progenitor had first assembled the\ncharacteristic mass, ${\\rm M}_{-2}$. The agreement is therefore not \nsurprising, as their model is based \nexplicitly on the results L14, which we deliberately\nreproduce using our new methodology. Indeed, the slight differences\nbetween the predictions of \\citet{Correa2015c} and our own can be \nattributed to changes brought about by replacing Einasto fits with the NFW\nfits upon which their model was calibrated. Note, however, that the\nmodel of L14 (and Correa et al) fails when applied to WDM power\nspectra because free-streaming modifies the proportionality constant\nbetween the characteristic density of a halo and the critical density\nat their particular choice of the collapse time. \n\n\\section{Parameter-dependence of the characteristic density-formation time relation}\n\\label{AppModel}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{./plots/FigA2.png}\n  \\caption{Mean enclosed density, \n    $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$, within the best-fitting scale radius,\n    $r_{-2}$, versus the critical density at \n    the redshift $z_F$ at which a fraction $F$ of the halo mass, ${\\rm M}_0$,\n    was first contained in \n    progenitors more massive than $0.02\\times {\\rm M}_0$.

The scaling\nrelations in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho} indicate that the value of $C$ will\ndepend sensitively on the precise definition of ``characteristic density''. If \ndefined to be $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$, the mean density within\n$r_{-2}$, then $C=400$. If, however, the characteristic density is\ndefined as that within $\\sim 3\\times r_{-2}$ then $C\\approx 200$ describes\nour numerical results quite well. Note that this is precisely what \nis expected from the spherical tophat collapse model. The simplest\ninterpretation of the parameter $C$ therefore is that it represents \nthe contraction of the inner halo beyond what is expected from simple \nspherical collapse. Lacking a theoretical model to provide deeper \ninsight, its numerical value must be calibrated using simulations,\nand may exhibit subtle dependencies on the precise definition of halo mass\nused. \n\nThe success (of lack thereof) of previous attempts by NFW and Gao et al \nto model the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation using using methods similar to ours\ncan be traced to each authors different definition of ``formation time''. \nBoth NFW and Gao et al assumed that a halo had ``formed'' when a fraction \n$F$ of its final mass had first assembled into clumps more massive than\na smaller fraction $f \\ll F$ of the same mass. Each of these parameters\naffects the precise value of $z_f$. NFW assumed $F=0.5$, Gao et al $F=0.1$,\nand both found $f=0.01$ as a suitable progenitor mass threshold.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho_F}, we plot the mean enclosed density within\nthe halo scale radius, $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=M_{-2}/(4/3)\\pi r_{-2}^3$, \nversus $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{F})$, the critical density \nat the redshift $z_{F}$ when the total collapsed mass first\nexceeded $F\\times M_0$. Different panels\nshow results for different values of $F$, and all assume \na small progenitor threshold, $f=0.02$. The points\ncorresponds to averages over single mass bins, and are shown for all four\nidentification redshifts after normalizing densities by the \ncritical value at $z_0$, $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_0)$. Note that only mass\nbins corresponding to halos with ${\\rm N}_{200}\\geq 10^4$ are plotted, which\nensures that all progenitors are resolved with at least 100 particles.\n\nAlthough all values of $F$ (which span a factor of 50)\nresult in a tight linear relation between the two densities, \nonly the particular choice $F= {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$ provides a direct proportionality between\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$ and $\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$ (the thin grey\nlines each each panel, for example, show the direct scaling\n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=400\\times\\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$, which\nprovides a reasonable description of the data only for $F= {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$).\nAll other values result in \nsteeper slopes that gradually shallow as $F$ is decreased but , even \nfor $F=0.01$, do not reach the natural linear scaling.\n\nFormation times also depend on the progenitor mass threshold, $f$. Previous\nstudies have hinted at puzzlingly small values: $f=0.01$ in the \ncase of NFW and Gao et al; $f=0.02$ in our case. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:rhorho_f}\nwe show how the mean characteristic density, $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$,\nof halos varies as a function of the redshift at which their characteristic mass,\n${\\rm M}_{-2}$, had first assembled into clumps each larger than $f\\times {\\rm M}_0$. \nNote that high values of $f$ (e.g. $f=0.5$, shown in the lower-right\npanel) result in steep power law slopes. Decreasing $f$ shifts all\nformation times to higher redshift, but the magnitude of the shift\ndepends on $\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle$. The net result,\nprovided $f$ becomes sufficiently small, provides a natural correspondence\nbetween characteristic density and the background density at the halo \nformation time. Note also that, at least in the CDM case, the precise\nvalues of $f$ seems unimportant, provided it is ``small enough'' (e.g.\n$f=0.005$, 0.01 and 0.02 all result in scaling relations whose slopes\ndo not deviate noticeably from one). As a rule of thumb, we suspect\nthat values of $f\\ll {\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$, of order a few per cent,\nwill yield robust results.\n\n\nOverall, we find that for $F={\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$ and $f\\approx 0.02$, the linear scaling, \n$\\langle\\rho_{-2}\\rangle=C\\times \\rho_{\\rm crit}(z_{-2})$, \nbetween these two densities is independent of both mass and\nidentification redshift. More importantly, however,\nthe zero-point of this relation is independent of the DM particle model:\nboth \\textsc{coco-cold} and \\textsc{coco-warm} have $C\\approx 400$. \nWe therefore advocate the use of these parameters in future modelling,\nbut acknowledge that better data, alternative halo definitions, or\nor a different variety of DM models may result in modifications.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{plots/FigA4.pdf}\n  \\caption{Predicted $c({\\rm M},z)$ relations for different\n    density profiles. Solid coloured lines assume an Einasto profiles\n    with $\\alpha=0.18$; dashed lines assume an NFW profile, and the\n    shaded region highlights the range of $c$ expected given the \n    (redshift-dependent) scatter in $\\alpha$ reported by\n    \\citet{Dutton2014}. Each model assumes $F={\\rm M}_{-2}/{\\rm M}_0$,\n    $f=0.02$ and $C=650$. Note that at low-mass the intrinsic\n    variation in the shapes of DM halo mass profiles may result in a\n    substantial contribution to the scatter in concentration.}\n  \\label{fig:cmz_alpha}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nMapping between characteristic densities and \nconcentrations requires an assumption regarding the halo mass\ndistribution. Throughout the paper we have adopted an Einasto profile\nwith $\\alpha=0.18$. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:cmz_alpha} we plot the predicted\nconcentration-mass relations at several redshifts and for a few other\ndensity profiles. The solid coloured lines correspond to our fiducial \n$\\alpha=0.18$ Einasto profile, dashed lines to an NFW profile and the\nshaded regions highlight the range of $c$ that is expected for\nEinasto models with a redshift-dependent scatter in $\\alpha$\nconsistent with the findings of \\citet{Dutton2014}. Note that at high\nmass, above $\\sim 10^{10} \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot$, the predicted\nconcentrations depend weakly on the assumed mass profile. Towards\nlower mass, however, when concentrations become large, a modest \nhalo-to-halo scatter in $\\alpha$ can lead to a considerable scatter in the\npredicted value of $c$. \n\n\n\\section{A fitting formula for the concentration-mass-redshift\n  relation in the Planck cosmology}\n\\label{AppPlanck}\n\nOur model for the $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation, when expressed in terms of\ndimensionless peak height, $\\nu(z)=\\delta_{\\rm sc}/\\sigma({\\rm M},z)$, can be\naccurately described by a broken power-law:\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  c(\\nu)=c_0\\biggl(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_0}\\biggr)^{-\\gamma_1}\n  \\biggl[1+\\biggl(\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_0}\\biggr)^{1/\\beta}\\biggr]^{-\\beta (\\gamma_2-\\gamma_1)}.\n  \\label{cnu}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"c(\\nu)=c_{0}\\biggl{(}\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{0}}\\biggr{)}^{-\\gamma_{1}}\\biggl{[}1+%&#10;\\biggl{(}\\frac{\\nu}{\\nu_{0}}\\biggr{)}^{1/\\beta}\\biggr{]}^{-\\beta(\\gamma_{2}-%&#10;\\gamma_{1})}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">(</mo><mfrac><mi>\u03bd</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">(</mo><mfrac><mi>\u03bd</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>\u03b2</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">]</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02624.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 84202, "prevtext": "\nHere $\\delta_{\\rm sc}=1.686$ is the spherical tophat collapse\nthreshold; $c_0$ and $\\nu_0$ are normalizing constants; $\\gamma_1$ and\n$\\gamma_2$ are the asymptotic power-law slopes towards low and high\n$\\nu$, respectively, and $\\beta$ is the width of the transition\nbetween these two regimes.\n\nAfter some experimentation, we found that the values of these\nparameters vary smoothly with redshift, $z$, and can be calibrated\nonce a cosmological model has been adopted.
