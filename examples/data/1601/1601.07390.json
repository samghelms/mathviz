Seitz [Phys. Fluids (1958-1988) 1, 2 (1958)], which uses classical nucleation theory to estimate the amount and the localization of the deposited energy required for bubble formation.\nHere we report on direct molecular dynamics simulations of heat-spike-induced bubble formation. They allow us to test the nanoscale process described in the classical heat spike model.\n40 simulations were performed, each containing about 20 million atoms, which interact by a truncated force-shifted Lennard-Jones potential.\nWe find that the energy per length unit needed for bubble nucleation agrees quite well with theoretical predictions, but the allowed spike length and the required total energy are about twice as large as predicted.\nThis could be explained by the rapid energy diffusion measured in the simulation: contrary to the assumption in the classical model, we observe significantly faster heat diffusion than the bubble formation time scale.\nFinally we examine $\\alpha$-particle tracks, which are much longer than those of neutrons and potential dark matter particles.\nEmpirically, $\\alpha$ events were recently found to result in louder acoustic signals than neutron events. This distinction is crucial for the background rejection in dark matter searches.\nWe show that a large number of individual bubbles can form along an $\\alpha$ track, which explains the observed larger acoustic amplitudes.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{05.10.-a, 29.40.-n, 05.70.Fh, 95.55.Vj}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\\begin{section}{Introduction}\nLiquids can be heated to a temperature higher than their boiling point, without yet going through a phase transition.\nThe liquids then exist in a metastable, or superheated state, which can be locally disrupted to induce bubble nucleation.\nFor example, the scattering of cosmic radiation off the liquid nuclei is an energy deposition, which can lead to bubble nucleation.\n\nIn the 1950s, this process motivated the use of such superheated liquids to detect particles in bubble chambers \\cite{Glaser2}, the most notable being Gargamelle at CERN, which is credited with the discovery of weak neutral currents \\cite{Gargamelle2}.\nWhile these detectors have been used extensively in the past, their applications today are limited mostly to monitoring and dosimetry \\cite{Apfel}.\n\nHowever, recent research projects, such as SIMPLE \\cite{SIMPLE,SIMPLE2,SIMPLE3}, PICASSO \\cite{PICASSO,PICASSO2,PICASSO3}, COUPP \\cite{COUPP,COUPP2}, and PICO \\cite{PICO} employ bubble chambers (or superheated droplet detectors\\textemdash modifications of bubble chambers) in the hope of directly detecting dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).\nWhile detection in bubble chambers used to consist of event picture taking, nowadays this is achieved by taking advantage of the explosive nature of the phase transition.\nThe explosions are accompanied by an acoustic shock wave, which is recorded by piezoelectric transducers, located on the chamber walls \\cite{piezo}.\nSuperheated liquid detectors are competitive and complementary to other dark matter detection methods \\cite{XENON2,CDMS2,CRESST2}.\nHowever there is still some discussion on several issues, one being the discrimination of WIMP signals from the $\\alpha$-particle background \\cite{alpha_discr}.\n\nThanks to increasing computing power, and highly scalable and efficient molecular dynamics codes, it is now possible to simulate phase transitions directly, within a realistic environment\\cite{Diemand13_Angelil13, Holyst10, Holyst12}.\nHomogeneous liquid-to-vapor nucleation has recently been simulated by some of us \\cite{Diemand14_Angelil14}, and the resulting nucleation rates and bubble properties were found to differ somewhat from classical nucleation theory.\nIn this work we simulate a similar liquid, just at a lower level of superheating to avoid homogeneous nucleation, and we add model heat spikes to probe their ability to induce bubble formation. The simulations \npresented here provide an atomistic description of heat-spike-induced bubble nucleation.\n\\end{section}\n\n\n\\begin{section}{Heat spike model}\nThe classic heat spike model underlies the theory of the bubble detector's functionality and induced bubble nucleation, and was developed by Seitz in 1958 \\cite{Seitz_paper}.\nIt has since been used to calibrate various detectors. However, its assumptions and predictions on the nanoscale process of bubble nucleation remain untested.\nThe model describes the formation of bubbles in highly localized and hot regions.\nThe formation process of a macroscopic bubble can be split into two parts:\n\n\nthe formation of a microscopic protobubble or nucleus, followed by\n\nthe growth phase into a macroscopic, gas-filled bubble.\n\nBecause we wish to determine the deposited energy and track length thresholds for stable bubble formation, in this paper our focus remains on the first part.\n\nA spherical bubble in mechanical equilibrium experiences a few competing influences: the outwards pressure of the vapor, the pressure from the surface tension acting to collapse the bubble, and the fluid pressure pushing inwards.\nThis leads to the condition\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n R_{c} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\Delta p} \\; ,\n \\label{eq:Rcrit}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"R_{c}=\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\Delta p}\\;,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></mfrac></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07390.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $n_{v}$ is the number of moles per unit volume at the equilibrium pressure and\n$H_{s}$ is the heat of sublimation per mole.

At 9\\textcelsius  (the running temperature of SIMPLE) this results in an equilibrium pressure and a surface tension which both agree to within\n26 percent between C$_{2}$ClF$_{5}$ \\cite{Okada} and our LJ fluid.\nThe main difference is that our simulations have a higher amount of superheat, a smaller critical radius ($10.47 \\sigma = 5.26$ nm vs. around 40 nm in SIMPLE \\cite{SIMPLE3}) and a much smaller required\nenergy deposition ($E_{m}=2164\\,\\epsilon = 70.42\\,eV$ vs. a few keV in SIMPLE).\nSimulating heat spikes at comparable thermodynamic conditions to those in the experiments is therefore possible with the same interaction potential,\nbut will require significantly larger simulation volumes (which is computationally very expensive) to accommodate the formation of large critical bubbles at constant ambient pressure.\n\nTo prepare the liquid in a superheated, metastable state, we use a procedure similar to that of Diemand \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Diemand14_Angelil14}:\nFirst 19'652'000 atoms are placed on a lattice corresponding to a density of $\\rho = 0.58\\,m\\sigma^{-3}$.\nThe particles are then randomly assigned velocities corresponding to \na temperature of $T=0.95\\,\\epsilon/k_{B}$. \nA fixed time step of $\\Delta t=0.0025\\,\\tau=0.0025\\sqrt{\\sigma^{2}m/\\epsilon}$ was used throughout all runs.\nA run of 10'000 time steps is initiated under \\textit{NVT} integration\n(constant particle number, volume, and temperature ensemble) at a temperature of $T = 0.95\\,\\epsilon/k_{B}$.\nThese are stable liquid conditions, used to equilibrate the atoms which were initially placed on a lattice.\nThe liquid is superheated by lowering the temperature from $T = 0.95\\,\\epsilon/k_{B}$ to $T = 0.855\\,\\epsilon/k_{B}$ over a relatively short period of 15'000 steps as an \\textit{NVT} ensemble.\n\nAnother \\textit{NVT} run of 15'000 steps is performed to stabilize the system at the new temperature $T = 0.855\\,\\epsilon/k_{B}$.\nThe thermostat is then turned off, and the simulation allowed to continue for 450'000 time steps with simple direct integration of the classical equations of motion (i.e., as a microcanonical or \\textit{NVE} ensemble).\nA typical simulation spreads 256 MPI tasks over the same number of cores, and runs for between six and eight hours.\n\nBubbles are identified with the same method as in \\cite{Watanabe,Diemand13_Angelil13}: The simulation volume is divided up into cubic cells of size $(3\\sigma)^3$.\nCells with a density $\\rho < 0.2\\,m\\sigma^{-3}$ are marked as vaporized regions and are recursively linked with neighboring vapor cells into a connected vapor bubble.\nAs expected, these runs did not result in spontaneously nucleated bubble formation due to the fact that the density was too close to the stable equilibrium value, making the free energy barrier between the liquid and the gaseous phase too high for spontaneous homogenous bubble nucleation.\n\nFollowing Seitz's model, we mimic the nuclear recoil energy injection heat spike by assigning higher velocities to all particles within a cylindrical region (see the upper panels of Fig. \\ref{fig:snapshots}).\nEach simulation continues for 200'000 to 500'000 time steps after the heat spike, in order to determine whether or not a stable, growing bubble manages to form out of the heat spike.\nIn total 40 simulations with different deposited energies and track lengths were performed.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{r153.png}\\hspace{3pt}\\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{r165.png}\\hspace{3pt}\\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{r200.png}\\vspace{3pt}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{r350.png}\\hspace{3pt}\\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{r475.png}\\hspace{3pt}\\includegraphics[width=0.15\\textwidth]{r650.png}\\vspace{3pt}\n  \\caption{(Color online) Projected snapshots of run at $7.5\\,\\tau$, $37.5\\,\\tau$, $125\\,\\tau$, $500\\,\\tau$, $812.5\\,\\tau$, and $1250\\,\\tau$ after a heat spike of $12k\\,\\epsilon$ along a length of $8\\,R_{c}$.}\n  \\label{fig:snapshots}\n\\end{figure}\n\\end{section}\n\n\n\n\\begin{section}{Simulation results}\nThe bubble nucleation event can be split into three stages (see Fig. \\ref{fig:growth}).\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item The first stage is preceded by a heat spike, which results in an explosion of the bubble radius \\footnote{We assume spherical bubbles when converting the observed bubble volume to a radius.

From the energy inputs required to generate a growing bubble (Fig. \\ref{fig:E}) we find $\\Delta E (\\Lambda=2) = 4166.1 \\pm 125.0\\, \\epsilon = 135.4 \\pm 4.1\\, eV$, which is about a factor of 2 higher.\nThe length scale over which the energy must be deposited ($\\Lambda R_{c}$) is also underestimated by the theory:\nAccording to Seitz, the energy contributing to one bubble formation event must be confined within a length of $2\\,R_{c}$; i.e., his model assumes $\\Lambda=2$.\nThe simulations however show that the critical energy can be spread over up to 4 critical lengths without losing bubble formation efficiency\\textemdash a discrepancy of a factor of 2.\nOn tracks longer than $\\Lambda=4$, the required total energy for bubble formation is higher, since only a fraction of this now too widely spread energy contributes to a single bubble formation event.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Eplot.pdf}\n  \\caption{(Color online) Energy plot of all runs with cylinder radius $r_{cyl}=2\\sigma$ and cylinder length $l_{cyl}=\\Lambda R_{c}$.\n  The critical energy to nucleate a bubble lies around $4500\\,\\epsilon$, and can be spread over up to a length of four critical radii, which is in both cases a factor of 2 greater than the theoretical predictions.}\n  \\label{fig:E}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor analysis it is also convenient to consider the relationship between the LET [see Eq. (\\ref{eq:LET})] and the cylinder length (see Fig. \\ref{fig:LET}).\nFor $\\Lambda = 4$ and all larger values we find LET values which are consistent with a constant value of $69.31 \\pm 4.41\\, \\epsilon/\\sigma = 4.50 \\pm 0.29\\, keV/\\mu m$. The theoretical prediction for the LET is quite accurate, just somewhat larger: $89.80\\, \\epsilon/\\sigma = 5.83\\, keV/\\mu m$.\n\nThe LET plots show that the Seitz predictions for the LET are accurate, provided that the LET is sustained for at least four times the critical radius.\nTwice the critical radius is insufficient. Even up to lengths of $\\Lambda = 26.88$ and $\\Lambda = 53.71$ for $\\alpha$-particle runs, the results match the predictions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{LETplot.pdf}\n  \\caption{(Color online) LET plot of same runs as in Fig. \\ref{fig:E}.\n  The LET matches the theoretical prediction, provided a length of at least four critical radii.}\n  \\label{fig:LET}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe have also investigated the dependence of the deposited energy on the cylinder radius.\nFor small cylinder radii ($0.744\\,\\sigma$ and $2\\,\\sigma$) and small $\\Lambda$, the required energies are almost equal, even though the number of atoms in the cylinder differs by a factor of $\\left(\\frac{2\\sigma}{0.744\\sigma}\\right)^{2} \\approx 7.22$. \n\nFor much higher cylinder radii, \n\nthe required energy must be higher also, because heat diffusion is accelerated with more atoms.\n\nAlthough the model makes some quite accurate predictions (e.g. for the LET), it contains several unrealistic simplifying assumptions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The microbubble thermophysical properties are assumed to be the same as in a planar, static, isothermal interface in equilibrium between bulk liquid and bulk vapor. \nThe inclusion of a more realistic surface tension, specifically, its dependence on bubble size \\cite{tolman1949,kyokotanaka2015}, should be addressed in future refinement of the model.\n\\item Viscosity is not included in the model.\n\\item Microbubbles are assumed to be spherical and to have a steplike vapor-liquid transition region. But critical bubbles are nonspherical and the width of their transition regions can be comparable to their radii \\cite{Angelil14}.\n\\item A more realistic model would include the complicated and evolving non-isothermal bubble temperature profiles due to the latent heat of transformation as well as compressive heat in the fluid directly outside the bubble due to rapid bubble expansion. Significant non-isothermal effects are found in our heat spike simulations and also in homogeneous bubble nucleation simulations; see \\cite{Angelil14}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{section}\n\n\n\\begin{section}{Dissipation of heat}\nSeitz's model assumes that a critically-sized bubble forms before the deposited energy diffuses out of the critical volume. As we shall show, this is not the case for our simulated liquid. To establish a criterion related to the dissipation of the deposited energy, we assume that the energy is\ndeposited uniformly in a spherical region of radius $R_{0}$ smaller than $R_{c}$.

But critical bubbles are nonspherical and the width of their transition regions can be comparable to their radii \\cite{Angelil14}.\n\\item A more realistic model would include the complicated and evolving non-isothermal bubble temperature profiles due to the latent heat of transformation as well as compressive heat in the fluid directly outside the bubble due to rapid bubble expansion. Significant non-isothermal effects are found in our heat spike simulations and also in homogeneous bubble nucleation simulations; see \\cite{Angelil14}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{section}\n\n\n\\begin{section}{Dissipation of heat}\nSeitz's model assumes that a critically-sized bubble forms before the deposited energy diffuses out of the critical volume. As we shall show, this is not the case for our simulated liquid. To establish a criterion related to the dissipation of the deposited energy, we assume that the energy is\ndeposited uniformly in a spherical region of radius $R_{0}$ smaller than $R_{c}$. The volume shall be equal to a cylinder volume of length $2 R_{c}$ and cross section $\\pi a^{2}$, similar to a track covered by a recoil. $a$ is chosen such that $\\frac{4\\pi}{3}a^{3}$ is the mean molecular volume, where $a$ is the van der Waals radius.

The contrary is the case for our simulations.\nThe expansion velocities of simulated bubbles are 3 to 10 times slower and lie in the same range as the speed of sound for a monoatomic gas.\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:Ekindens}, we show the evolution of density and average of the kinetic energy, which is proportional to temperature, averaged over a fixed volume of radius R$_{c}$ centered on the midpoint of the heat spike, which was inserted at time t$=0$.\nAfter a time of about 60 $\\tau$ the density values do not change significantly anymore inside this volume, since the bubble exceeds the critical size after this time.\nA quick dimensional analysis with values from \\cite{koreanbull} lets us expect a thermal conductivity of 0.1 $J K^{-1} m^{-1} s^{-1}$, and we get a heat flow of $\\frac{Q}{t} = 3.4 \\,J/\\tau_{c}$.\nThe internal energy per atom is $U = \\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T \\approx 10^{-21} J$ within a time of $\\tau_{c}$, which means that an energy of about 32'000 atoms can be transported out of the critical volume.\nThese dimensions lie well within the range of our simulation results.\n\nIt would also be very interesting to measure the evolution of pressure inside the bubble volume after the heat spike, which then would give insights to the surface tension at the bubble boundary, i.e., the surface tension as a function of the bubble radius.

Our molecular dynamics simulations of dark matter bubble detectors are the first attempt of an atomistic, computational description of the heat-spike-induced bubble nucleation event. Our results qualitatively confirm the general framework assumed in the classical heat spike model by Seitz, but also show some interesting quantitative differences. \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item In comparison to the model predictions, for stable bubbles to be successfully nucleated, we find that the deposited energy must be approximately twice as much, whereas the length over which it is deposited can be twice as long. This means that the model predictions actually are rather accurate for the linear energy transfer prediction for tracks, which are at least 4 critical radii long, twice the length assumed in the model. The measured heat diffusion time scale is shorter than the time it takes to form a critical size bubble, contrary to what is assumed in the model, which could explain the larger-than-expected required energy deposition for bubble formation. \n\n \\item In the bubble-chamber dark matter particle search community there is still some discussion on the discrimination of WIMP signals from the $\\alpha$-particle background \\cite{alpha_discr}, which depends on exact energy predictions from the model of induced bubble nucleation.\nBy giving corrections to the energy predictions of the model, this paper and further work could help in the correct calibration of the detectors and analysis of data, especially the discrimination of $\\alpha$-particle background, and generally gives a better understanding of the measuring processes.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nLarge future simulations would be needed to explore more stable fluid critical bubbles as large as in the detectors. The rescaled thermodynamic properties of our LJ fluid are comparable to some of the detector fluids; however to closely match one specific detector it would be worthwhile to simulate more specific and more complicated fluids. Our simulations demonstrate complications (bubble properties, non-isothermal effects, etc.) which are neglected in the classical heat spike model by Seitz, which might provide an opportunity for constructing more realistic models of the process. \n\\newline\n\n\\end{section}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n\n We thank Kyoko and Hidekazu Tanaka, Tom Girard, and the SIMPLE team for valuable discussions and feedback.
