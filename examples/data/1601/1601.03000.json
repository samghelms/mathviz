As specific examples one can cite The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) mission and the SKA radio project.\n\nAlthough GR is a very well tested theory and its predictions have been confirmed with solar system and binary pulsars observations the cosmological arena still challenges it. \nActually, by adopting GR we are left with the strong indication that $\\sim 95\\%$ of the energy budget of the universe is \nunknown. \nAccording to the most recent observations, this fraction is divided into the probably fraction of $\\sim25\\%$ for dark matter and $\\sim70\\%$ for dark energy.\n\nOne possible solution relies in modifying GR on large (cosmological) scales. \nBy replacing either the dark matter or the dark energy component by some extended theory of gravity (ETG) the already confirmed prediction of GR should be reconquered. \nThis happens usually via the inclusion of screening mechanisms around an astrophysical environment where the ETG predictions should suffer a metamorphopsia back to the GR ones. \nIf this is actually the case, it is therefore expected that the NS interior and its habitat remains described by GR. \nHowever, the use of NSs for constraining ETGs has become a fruitful route of investigation. \nSee \\cite{MGTNS} for a few recent works on this topic.\n\nThe first usual procedure is to compute the analogue of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation \n\\cite{OV, Tolman:1939dn}---the GR structure for static and spherical objects---for your favorite ETG. \nIn general, departures from the standard TOV equation are non-trivial. \nHowever, it can be useful to understand how masses and radii of NSs are shifted in the $M-R$ plane according to specific changes in the TOV structure.\nIn this sense, a recent and interesting work \\cite{PostTOV} proposed a ``Post-TOV'' formalism based on the parametrized post-Newtonian theory in which non-GR effects can be separately studied in relativistic stars. \nWe also point out the analysis done in Ref. \\cite{Schwab:2008ce} in which the specific pressure contribution to the active gravitational mass in NSs is studied in detail. \n\nOur aim in this contribution is to propose a free parametrization for the TOV equation. \nThe curious reader can go directly to Eqs. (\\ref{eq:pTOV}) and (\\ref{dMdrsigma}). \nIn some sense, this is an extension of \\cite{Schwab:2008ce}. \nOur approach should be seen as a pedagogical guide to understand the role played by different physical contributions to the TOV equation rather than new a ETG. \n\nIn the next section we review a quick derivation of the TOV equation. \nSection \\ref{secPTOV} presents our free parametrization for stellar equilibrium equations. \nWe will adopt one realistic EoS for the NS interior and show in section \\ref{secN} results on the $M-R$ plane when varying such new parameters. \nIn the final section we discuss in more detail the role played by each parameter. We use $c=\\hslash =1$ units.\n\n\n\\section{The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation}\n\nIn this section we review the derivation of the TOV equation which can be found in most textbooks about GR or relativistic astrophysics.\n\nThe first and simplest step in studying stellar objects is to consider that matter is spherically symmetric distributed in a static geometry i.e., time reversal about any origin of time,   \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nds^2 =  -B(r)dt^2+A(r)dr^2+r^2(d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)\\quad.\n\\label{eq:metrica}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere hereafter $B(r)\\equiv B; A(r)\\equiv A$. General relativity is based on Einstein's equations\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nR_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu} R = 8\\pi G T_{\\mu\\nu}\\quad,\n\\label{eq:Einstein}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor and $R$ is the curvature scalar (trace of tensor $R_{\\mu\\nu}$). \nThe matter content, in this case, the internal description of the star, is encapsulated in the energy-momentum tensor  \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nT_{\\mu\\nu} &=& (\\rho + p) u_\\mu u_\\nu + p g_{\\mu\\nu}\\quad,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere respectively $\\rho$ and $p$ are the density and pressure of the fluid which depend on the radial coordinate only. Also, $u_\\mu$ is the 4-velocity (with $u_\\mu u^{\\mu} = -1$). Noticed that the fluid is at rest, then $u_{r}=u_{\\theta}=u_{\\phi}=0$ and $u_t=-(-g^{tt})^{-1/2}=-\\sqrt{B}$. \n\nIn order to derive the TOV equation we need to consider the conservation $T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\quad;\\nu}=0,$ which is concomitant with Bianchi's identities.

For example, the unified BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21 EoSs approximate, respectively, the EoSs FPS \\cite{Lorentz, Friedman:1981fj} (soft), APR \\cite{Akmal:1998vn} (moderate), and V18 \\cite{Li:2008fr} (stiff)---see also \\cite{Potekhin:2013si} for discussion and references.\n\nIn general, predictions for the maximum masses in BSk models slightly differ. \nBSk19 EoS does not allow masses larger than $2 M_{\\odot}$ and therefore observations of very massive neutron stars with radius $\\sim 13$~Km would favor the BSk20 and BSk21 fits. \nAn up to date compilation of observed neutron stars via different observational methods can be found in \\cite{stellarcollapse}. \n\nWe will use in this contribution the BSk20 only. \nOur strategy is to fix the GR configuration and let one or two parameters change simultaneously.\nThis will be shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig1}. \nIn each panel of this figure the solid black line represents the GR configuration. \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{Fig1.eps}\n\\caption{Mass-radius diagram for various choices of the parameters $\\alpha;\\,\\beta;\\,\\gamma;\\,\\chi;\\,\\sigma$.

By keeping the BSk20 EoS for the neutron star interior--- which is realistic in the sense that equilibrium configurations achieve $2 M_{\\odot}$ using GR---we seek the impact of the new parameters $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\chi$ and $\\sigma$. \nThey can be visualized in Eq. (\\ref{eq:pTOV}). \n\nThe simplest expected manifestation of modified gravity theories occurs via a redefinition of the effective gravitational coupling $G_{eff}\\rightarrow G(1+\\alpha)$.  \nThe effects of $\\alpha$ on the $M-R$ plane are seen in the panels belonging to row $A$ (see the caption of Fig. \\ref{Fig1}). \nThe larger the $\\alpha$ value, the smaller the typical radius of the equilibrium configurations. \nThe maximum mass is also reduced. \n\nThe parameter $\\beta$ is clearly related to the maximum mass. The larger the inertial effects of pressure ($\\beta$), the smaller the maximum mass.   \n\nConcerning the parameter $\\chi$ we have confirmed the findings of \\cite{Schwab:2008ce}, i.e., the self-gravity of pressure contributes to reducing the maximum allowed NS with almost no impact on the radius of the star.\n\nThe impact of parameter $\\gamma$ is relevant to panels $AIII, BI$ and $CI$. In the Newtonian hydrostatic equilibrium $\\gamma=0$. However, \nby re-performing the Newtonian classical case with a modified Newtonian potential of the type $V(r)=-\\frac{GM}{r-A} $, where $A$ is a constant, it \nis possible to obtain a similar contribution with a singularity in the denominator of the TOV equation like the $\\gamma=1$ case. \nThe existence of a maximum mass (absent in the Newtonian case) is a pure relativistic prediction. But it is worth noting that the curves with $\\gamma=0$ produce indeed a maximum mass, but with a very large value which can not be seen in these plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{MassNs} D.
