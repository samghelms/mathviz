The logic being that systems will typically reach\nan equilibrium point, following some dynamic, a dynamic that may be difficult to understand or analyze.  Of course, in order for the equilibrium concept to be predictive, it must correspond to\noutcomes of the types of dynamics we consider possible.   In Game Theory, the leading equilibrium concept is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n\nIn Algorithmic Game Theory, Nash equilibrium is not the only notion of equilibrium that is considered.\nOn the one hand, it is typically computationally-hard to find a Nash equilibrium, and\nso it is questionable whether a Nash equilibrium can be viewed as a reasonable prediction of an outcome of a game.  In contrast, there are a host of natural ``learning-like'' dynamics that converge\nto more general notions of equilibria, specifically to {\\em correlated equilibria} or to the even more general\n{\\em coarse equilibria}\\footnote{Sometimes called ``coarse correlated equilibria'' \\cite{Y04} or ``Hannan consistent'' \\cite{HM01}.}\nwhich often seem to be more natural predications than Nash equilibria.   It is thus common to consider also\nthese more general notions of equilibrium in scenarios studied in Algorithmic Mechanism Design.\n\nThis extension of our concept of the class of possible equilibria has a\nbright side and a dark side.  On the negative side,\nif we accept that one of these generalized equilibria notions is a possible outcome, then we need to ensure that all such equilibria produce whatever result is desired by us\n(in terms of ``Price of Anarchy\", we can get worse bounds as we need to take the worst case performance over a wider set of equilibria.)  On the positive side, in cases\nwhere we can control the equilibrium reached (e.g. by coding specific dynamics into software), we may take advantage of the extra flexibility to obtain better equilibria points\n(in terms of ``Price of Stability'', we may get better bounds, as we can choose an equilibrium within a wider class).\n\nIn this paper we study correlated equilibria and coarse equilibria in the simplest auction model: a full-information first-price auction of a single item.  This is the simplest instance in the class of simultaneous auctions\nstudied in a line of work that has received much attention lately \\cite{CKS08,BR11,HKMN11,FFGL13,ST13}.\nHere too the literature is concerned both about the difficulty of reaching equilibria \\cite{CP14,DFK15,DS15,DMSW15} and about the additional loss of efficiency or revenue in\nthese generalized types of equilibria\\footnote{For example, while pure Nash equilibria of simultaneous first-price auctions are known to be fully efficient, mixed Nash equilibria may not \\cite{HKMN11}.}.\nA loss of efficiency here\ncorresponds to mis-allocation of the item (i.e. the winner not being the bidder with the highest value), while a loss of revenue may also be viewed as a type of implicit self-stabilizing\ncollusion between the bidders \\cite{LMS11}.\n\nFor concreteness, consider the case where Alice has value 1 for the item and Bob has value 2 where the values are\ncommon knowledge and they are participating in a first price auction.  In this game the strategy space of\neach bidder is the set of possible bids (non-negative numbers), and the outcome from a pair of\nbids $a$ by Alice and $b$ by Bob is that Alice wins whenever $a>b$ and pays\n$a$ (so her utility is $1-a$ and Bob's utility is 0) and Bob wins whenever $b>a$ and pays $b$\n(so his utility is $2-b$ and Alice's utility is 0).  For simplicity, let us\nassume that ties are broken in favor of Bob, i.e. that he wins whenever $b \\ge a$.\n\nIt is quite easy to analyze the pure Nash equilibria of this game: for every value of $1 \\le v \\le 2$\nthere exists an equilibrium where both Alice and Bob bid the same value $v$, and Bob wins the tie.\nIn the general case of first price auctions, the price\n$v$ may be anything between the first price and the second price in the auction.\\footnote{This requires that the player with the highest value -- Bob in our example --\nwins the tie; otherwise no pure equilibrium exists but arbitrarily close $\\epsilon$-equilibria do.}\nWhile non-trivial, it is also not difficult to analyze the mixed Nash equilibria of this\ngame, where it turns out that every mixed Nash equilibrium is outcome-equivalent to a pure Nash equilibrium \\cite{CKST13}.  ``Outcome equivalent'' means that we get the same\ndistribution of the identity of the winner and of his payment.  In particular, all mixed (or pure) Nash equilibria of a full-information first price auction attain\nperfect social welfare (i.e. the player with highest value always wins) and have revenue that is\nbounded below by the second highest value in the auction (and from above by the highest value).\n\nWhat about correlated equilibria and coarse equilibria?  It is easy to see that correlated equilibria give a somewhat richer class of outcomes, since certainly a\nsingle correlated equilibrium can mix between several pure equilibria.  Our first result shows that this is all that can be obtained, so in particular,\ncorrelated equilibria also yield perfect social welfare and a revenue that is at least the second highest value.\n\n\\vspace{0.1in}\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Theorem:} Every correlated equilibrium of a first-price auction is outcome-equivalent to a mixture of pure Nash equilibria.\n\n\\vspace{0.1in}\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{LMS11} a similar theorem was proved for the special case of  symmetric bidders, even in Bayesian settings.  Whether or not correlated equilibria can be richer in non-symmetric Bayesian settings remains open\\footnote{Note, however, that in asymmetric Bayesian settings, even in (Bayesian) Nash equilibria, the winner is not necessarily the bidder with the highest valuation \\cite{KZ12}.}.\nThere are several other known cases of games where correlated equilibria cannot improve upon Nash equilibria (see \\cite{MGR13} and references therein).\nIn \\cite{DKT14} it was shown, in a more general setting than the one described here, that there is a \\emph{unique} correlated equilibrium if one eliminates \\emph{weakly dominated strategies}.  That is, if no player ever bids above their value.  One can indeed verify that the only correlated equilibrium satisfying this constraint is the pure Nash equilibrium in which both agents bid the second-highest value.  \n\n\nWe then turn our attention to coarse equilibria, and it turns out that a wider set of outcomes becomes possible. \nIn \\cite{SyrgkanisThesis} a coarse equilibrium is exhibited in a two-player single-item auction that is not outcome-equivalent \nto a mixture of pure auctions.  In fact, its welfare is only $1-1/e=0.632120...$ fraction of the optimal.\n\n\nThis matches the general Price of Anarchy upper bound given in \\cite{ST13} (established via the smoothness technique \\cite{R15,ST13}), \nwhich applies even to general multi-item simultaneous auctions with XOS bidders.\nFor multi-item simultaneous auctions, this bound of $1-1/e$ is tight even with respect to Nash equilibria \\cite{CKST13}, but for single-item auctions, as we have seen,\nit is only tight for coarse equilibira and not for correlated or for Nash equilibria.\n\nThe example that attains this low welfare has the undesirable property that it uses weakly dominated strategies.\nI.e. in this example, the support of the coarse equilibrium contains strategies\nwhere one of the players bids above\nhis value.  The natural question at this point is whether there exists other coarse equilibria that do not use over-bidding.\nConsider the following example, in Table 1, of a coarse equilibrium, \nwhere $\\epsilon$ is some small enough constant (e.g. $\\epsilon=10^{-4}$).\n\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\caption{A coarse equilibrium in an auction with $v_{Alice}=1, \\:\\: v_{Bob}=2$}\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}\n      Probability & Alice's Bid & Bob's Bid\\\\\n      \\hline\n      2\\% & $\\epsilon$ & $0$ \\\\\n      2\\% & $0.1+\\epsilon$ & $0.1$ \\\\\n      3\\% & $0.5-\\epsilon$ & $0.5$ \\\\\n      11\\% & $0.8-\\epsilon$ & $0.8$ \\\\\n      19\\% & $0.9-\\epsilon$ & $0.9$ \\\\\n      63\\% & $1-\\epsilon$ & $1$ \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\nOne may directly verify that this is indeed\na coarse equilibrium.\\footnote{Ignoring $O(\\epsilon)$ terms, at equilibrium we\nhave: For Alice: $u_A = 0.02*1+0.02*0.9 = 0.038$\nwhile deviating to 0 would yield utility 0.02, deviating to 0.1 yield utility 0.036,\ndeviating to 0.5 yield utility 0.035, deviating to 0.8 yield utility 0.036, deviating to 0.9\nyield utility 0.37 and deviating to 1 yield utility 0.  For Bob we have $u_B = 0.03*1.5 + 0.11 * 1.2 + 0.19 * 1.1 + 0.63 * 1 = 1.016$, but deviating to 1 would give utility 1,\nand deviating to anything below 1 would loose with probability of at least $63\\%$\nleading to utility that is certainly less than 1.}  This finite equilibrium allocates the\nitem to Alice sometimes, and so the social welfare that it reaches is not perfect!\nAlso notice that the winner pays at most 1 for the item, but sometimes pays strictly less\nthan 1, and thus the revenue is strictly smaller than the second price!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the natural question is what\nis the lowest welfare possible in a coarse equilibrium where no player overbids.\nWe might term this ratio ``PoUA'' --\n``the price of {\\em undominated} anarchy''.  We show that indeed insisting that players never overbid ensures\na significantly higher share of welfare, and provide tights bounds for it.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first indication that a no overbidding restriction improves worst case guarantees in\nfirst-price auctions.\\footnote{In contrast, for multi-item simultaneous auctions, the $1-1/e$ bound is tight for XOS valuations even without overbidding \\cite{CKS08}.}\n\n\\vspace{0.1in}\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Theorem:}\nIn every coarse equilibrium of a single-item first-price auction where players\nnever bid above their value, the social\nwelfare is at least $0.813559...$ fraction of the optimal.\n\n\\vspace{0.1in}\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Theorem:}\nThere exists a single-item first-price auction with two players that has a coarse equilibrium where players\nnever bid above their value, with social\nwelfare that is $0.813559...$ fraction of the optimal.\n\n\\vspace{0.1in}\n\nWe then focus our attention on the revenue of the auction.

Player $i$ has value $v_i$ for the item, and we index the players so that $v_1 \\geq v_2 \\geq \\dotsc \\geq v_n$.\n\nThe auction proceeds as follows:\n\nthe players simultaneously submit real-valued bids, $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\dotsc, x_n)$.\nTies are broken according to a fixed \n\ntie-breaking function, which maps the (maximal) bids to a winner.\nPlayer $i$ wins when $x_i \\geq x_j$ for all $j$ and the tie at value $x_i$ (if any) is broken in favor of player $i$, which we denote by $x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}$.\nThe winner pays his or her bid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven a joint distribution $D$ over the bids of the players, the expected payment of player $i$ is $E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[x_i \\cdot 1_{x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}}]$, so his expected utility is $u_i = v_i \\cdot Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}] - E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[x_i \\cdot 1_{x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}}]$.\n\nWe will study correlated and coarse correlated equilibria of the auction.

Thus every construction of\nan equilibrium that we provide using a particular tie-breaking rule immediately implies also\nan $\\epsilon$-equilibrium for any tie breaking rule and any $\\epsilon>0$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The Distribution on the Winning Price}\nWhen analysing revenue and welfare in an equilibrium,\nit will be most convenient to consider the single-dimensional distribution on the winning price, i.e., on\n\n$\\max_i\\{ x_i \\}$.\nWe will denote the cumulative distribution on the winning price by $F$.  The revenue\ncan be easily expressed in terms of $F$ as $Revenue = E_{x \\sim F}[x]  = \\int (1-F(x))dx$ (where the integration\nis over the support of the distribution.)\n\nThe starting point for our analysis of {\\em coarse equilibria} is the following.\nSuppose there are $n=2$ players, say Alice and Bob, with values $1$ and $v \\leq 1$ respectively.\nIf Alice chooses to deviate from the equilibrium to some fixed bid $x$, then her utility will be\n$(1-x)\\cdot F_{Bob}(x) \\ge (1-x) \\cdot F(x)$ (this expression ignores the possibility of a tie),\nwhere $F_{Bob}$ is the cumulative distribution of\nBob's bid, which is certainly stochastically dominated by the cumulative distribution on the winning bid.\nIn our constructions we will typically have both Alice and Bob always bidding the same value $x=y$ (where\nthis joint value is distributed\naccording to $F$), and thus will have $F_{Bob}=F$.\n\nDenoting Alice's utility at equilibrium by $\\alpha$, a necessary condition that this deviation is not profitable is thus\n$\\alpha \\ge (1-x)\\cdot F(x)$, i.e. that $F(x) \\le \\alpha/(1-x)$.  Similarly for Bob we must have\n$F(x) \\le \\beta/(v-x)$, where $\\beta$ is Bob's utility at equilibrium.  Thus if $F$ corresponds to a coarse equilibrium then it must be stochastically dominated\nby the minimum of these two expressions.\n\nThe following simple calculation\nstates the closed form expression for the revenue of a distribution of these forms.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{lem:expected}\nLet the cumulative distribution function $G=G_{a,b}$ be defined by\n$G(x)=a/(b-x)$ for $0 \\le x \\le b-a$.  Then, $E_G[x] = b-a+a \\ln (a/b)$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\section{Correlated equilibrium}\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this section is to establish that every correlated equilibrium of a first-price auction is outcome-equivalent to a mixture of pure Nash equilibria.  We begin by showing that the winning bid is never lower than the second-highest of the players' values.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nFor every correlated equilibrium $D$,\n\n\n$Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\} < v_2]=0$\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nAssume otherwise.\n\nLet $S = \\{ p | Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\}<p]>0 \\}$, and let $p^*=\\inf(S)<v_2$.\nFix some $p^*<p<(p^*+v_2)/2$,\nfor which we thus have $Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\} < p]=\\delta>0$.\n\nConsider players $1$ and $2$.\nOne of the two players must be winning with probability of at most $\\delta/2$ (when $\\max_i\\{x_i\\} < p$), say player $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\n\nI.e., $Pr_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[p > x_j \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}]\\ge \\delta/2$.\n(recall that $x_j \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}$ means that either $x_j$ is strictly larger than the other bids, or that it is weakly larger and tie at that value is broken in favor of player $j$).\n\n\nNow let's consider the following deviation function $b_j$ for player $j$.  Choose $\\epsilon > 0$ so that $p+2\\epsilon < (p^*+v_2)/2$ (which is possible by the choice of $p$ above).  Then define $b_j(x_j) = p+\\epsilon$ for all $x_j \\le p$, and $b_j(x_j) = x_j$ for all $x_j > p$.  That is, when being told any value $x_j \\le p$, player $j$ bids instead $p+\\epsilon$.  On the up side,\nthis will certainly win all the cases where $\\max_i\\{x_i\\}<p$, increasing the probability of winning by at least $\\delta/2$ and thus increasing his utility by at least\n$\\delta\\cdot (v_2-p-\\epsilon)/2$.  On the down side, player $j$ now pays $p+\\epsilon$ when he wins rather than his original bid $x_j$.  Since player $j$ never won when $x_j<p^*$ (as $Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\}<p^*]=0$, by definition of $p^*$) he pays at most $(p-p^*)+\\epsilon$ more whenever he wins, which happened with probability of at most $\\delta/2$.  Thus the down side of player $j$'s utility from deviation is at most $\\delta \\cdot (p-p^*+\\epsilon)/2$.  So the deviation is profitable whenever $\\delta\\cdot (v_2-p-\\epsilon)/2 > \\delta \\cdot (p-p^*+\\epsilon)/2$ which is the case due to our choice of $\\epsilon$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe next show that only the players with the highest value can ever win in a correlated equilibrium.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nFor every correlated equilibrium $D$, and for any player $i$ such that $v_i < v_1$, $Pr_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}] = 0$.\n\n\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nBy the previous lemma, no one ever wins with a price that is strictly less than $v_2$.  On the other hand, if any player $i > 1$ ever wins with a price that is strictly more than $v_i$, their utility will be negative, making a deviation to a bid 0 profitable.  This immediately implies the desired result if $v_2 = v_1$, so from this point onward we will assume $v_2 < v_1$.\n\nThe only case we further need to consider is if some player $i \\geq 2$ with $v_i = v_2$ wins at price exactly $v_2$, say with some probability $\\delta > 0$.\n\nBut then player $1$ would prefer to deviate\nfrom any $x_1 \\le v_2$ to $v_2+\\epsilon$, gaining utility of at least $\\delta (v_1-v_2-\\epsilon)$ due to winning all cases in which $\\max_i\\{x_i\\} \\leq v_2$, and losing at most $\\epsilon$ due to the additional payment (since player $1$ never pays less than $v_2$ when she wins).  Choosing $\\epsilon$ small enough, this deviation becomes profitable.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn conclusion we have a complete characterization of correlated equilibria is terms of their outcomes.  Clearly every mixture of pure equilibria is a correlated\nequilibrium, and this turns out to be all that is possible:\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nEvery correlated equilibrium of the single-item first-price auction is equivalent (in terms of winning probabilities and payments) to a mixture of pure equilibria\n(where Alice always wins the ties).\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nFirst suppose $v_1 > v_2$.  Since by the previous lemma player $1$ always wins, and never pays less than $v_2$, she must always bid at least $v_2$.  Clearly player $1$ can never bid more than $v_1$ since that will give her negative utility (as she does always win).  Thus player $1$'s bid $x_1$ is supported on the interval $[v_2,v_1]$ and she always wins.  The outcome is thus equivalent to that of a similar distribution on the pure equilibria in which all players bid $x \\in [v_2, v_1]$ (with player $1$ winning the ties).\n\nIf $v_1 = v_2$ then only the maximum-valued players ever win, and the winner always pays at least $v_1$.\nThe utility of every player is therefore exactly $0$.  The outcome is thus equivalent to a similar distribution on the pure equilibria, in which all players bid $v_1$ and ties are broken in favor of the appropriate maximum-value player.\n\n\n\\end{proof}\n\nOur characterization also implies that the revenue of the auctioneer is always at lease the second highest value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Price of Undominated Anarchy}\n\nThe following theorem shows that if players do not over bid, the welfare guarantee in any CCE improves from $63\\%$ to $81\\%$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm-poua}\nIn every coarse equilibrium of the single-item first price auctioneer players\nnever bid above their value, the social\nwelfare is at least $0.813559...$ fraction of the optimal.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet us start by normalizing the values of the players in the auction: let us call\nthe player with highest value Alice, and normalize this value to 1, and let us call the player with\nsecond highest value Bob, so his value is $v \\le 1$.  There could be other players in the auction but our analysis\nwill ignore them.  Fix a coarse equilibrium\nof that auction.  Let us further denote Alice's utility in the equilibrium by $\\alpha$ and Bob's utility by $\\beta$.\nSince\nBob never uses undominated strategies, he always bids at most $v$ and thus\nAlice can always deviate to $v+\\epsilon$\nobtaining a utility of $1-v$.  hence we must have $\\alpha \\ge 1-v$.  Denote by $F_{CE}$ the cumulative distribution\non the price paid by the winner of the auction, so the fact that Alice does not want to deviate implies that\n$F_{CE}(x) \\le \\alpha/(1-x)$ for all $0 \\le x \\le 1-\\alpha$ and the fact that Bob does not want to deviate\nimplies that $F_{CE}(x) \\le \\beta/(v-x)$ for all $0 \\le x \\le v-\\beta$.  Thus the distribution\n$F_{CE}$ stochastically dominates the following distribution whose cumulative distribution function is\n$F(x) = \\min\\{ \\tfrac{\\alpha}{1-x}, \\tfrac{\\beta}{v-x} \\}$ for $0 \\le x \\le max(v-\\beta, 1-\\alpha)$ (and $0$ for $x \\le 0$).\nThe revenue raised by the auction is simply\nthe expected value of the winning price which is bounded from below by the\nexpected value of $x$ that is drawn according to $F$.  Thus $Revenue \\ge \\int_0^1 (1-F(x))dx$, and a\nlower bound to\nthe welfare is obtained by adding this revenue to $\\alpha+\\beta$.\nWe will calculate such a lower bound, over all\npossible values of $\\alpha \\ge 1-v$, $\\beta$, and $v \\le 1$.\nI.e. we will show that for all possible values of $\\alpha, \\beta,$ and $v$,\nwe have that $\\alpha+\\beta+\\int_0^1 (1-F(x))dx \\ge 0.813559...$.\n\nIn calculating $\\int_0^1 (1-F(x))dx$ we will split into two cases.\nWe start with the easy case, where $\\beta \\ge v\\alpha$.  This is\nthe easy case since here $\\beta/(v-x) \\ge 1/(1-x)$ for all $0 \\le x \\le v$ and thus $F$\nsimplifies to $F(x)=\\alpha/(1-x)$ for all\n$0 \\le x \\le 1-\\alpha$, and so our integral simplifies to\n$Revnue = \\int_0^{1-\\alpha} (1-\\alpha/(1-x))dx = 1-\\alpha +\\alpha \\log \\alpha$.\nThus a lower bound on the welfare is $\\alpha + \\beta + 1 -\\alpha + \\alpha\\log\\alpha$.\nIn this case we had that $\\beta \\ge \\alpha v \\ge \\alpha (1-\\alpha)$\nso our lower bound on welfare, over all\n$\\beta$ and $v$ is $welfare \\ge 1 + \\alpha(1-\\alpha) + \\alpha \\log \\alpha$.  This attains its\nminimum of $0.838...$ over all $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$ at $\\alpha=0.203..$ (where $\\alpha$ is the\nsolution to the equation $2x-\\log x-2=0$)\nand so we have that for the case $\\beta \\ge v\\alpha$ the welfare is at least $0.838... > 0.813559...$.\n\\footnote{To get an auction with these parameters we need to spicy when each of the players\nwins in a way that will achieve these values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nThe following parameters yield these utilities: Alice and Bob bid the same value of $x$\ndistributed according to the same $F$ that provided the\nlower bound: $\\alpha$ that is\nthe solution of the equation $2x-\\log x-2=0$, $v=1-\\alpha$ and $\\beta=v\\alpha$ .\nAlice wins whenever $x=0$ and Bob wins otherwise.\nThus the probability that Alice wins is $\\alpha=F(0)$ and she pays nothing,\nindeed obtaining utility of $\\alpha$.

Taking the derivative with respect to $\\beta$\nwe get $1 + \\log(\\alpha\\beta/((1-\\alpha)(\\alpha-\\beta))$ which becomes $0$ for\n$\\beta=(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1)$.  We now split again into two cases.\nIn the first case, this value\nof $\\beta$ is within the possible range,\n$(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1) < \\alpha v = \\alpha(1-\\alpha)$ and so the\nminimum is obtained at this value of $\\beta$, and the second case is where\n$(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1) > \\alpha (1-\\alpha)$ in which\ncase the minimum is obtained at the highest possible value of $\\beta=\\alpha (1-\\alpha)$.\n\nWe start with the second case of $\\beta=\\alpha(1-\\alpha)$ for which the welfare\nsimplifies to: $1-\\alpha^2+\\alpha+\\alpha log(\\alpha)$ which attains its minimum of $0.838...$\nat $\\alpha=0.203..$, where $\\alpha$ is the solution of $2-2x+\\log x = 0$.  (This is exactly the same point\nidentified above by our analysis above of the easy case of $\\beta \\ge \\alpha v$.)\n\nFor the first case where $\\beta=(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1)$, we plug in this\nvalue of $\\beta$ into the expression for welfare which then simplifies to\n$\\alpha log((e \\alpha)/((e-1) \\alpha+1))+1$ which attains its minimum of $0.813559...$\nat $\\alpha=0.274322...$, where $\\alpha$ is\nthe solution of $(((e-1) x+1) log((e x)/((e-1) x+1))+1)/((e-1) x+1)=0$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe now show that this bound is tight, by exhibiting an auction with\nmatching welfare.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm-poua-lb}\nThere exists a single-item two-player auction with player values\n$1$ and $v \\leq 1$, and a coarse equilibrium of that auction where\nplayers never bid above their values,\nwhose social welfare matches the bound from Theorem~\\ref{thm-poua} $(0.813559...)$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nOur equilibrium will take a form developed in the proof of Theorem \\ref{thm-poua}.\nCall the player with value $1$ Alice, and the player with value $v \\leq 1$ Bob.\n\n\nGuided by the proof of Theorem~\\ref{thm-poua}, we will choose a parameter $\\alpha$,\nthen set\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 14900, "prevtext": "\n\\end{definition}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{definition}\nA joint distribution $D$ over bids is a \\emph{coarse correlated equilibrium} (or coarse equilibrium for short) if, for every player $i$ and for every unilateral deviation $x_i' \\in {\\mathbb{R}}$ of player $i$, it holds that\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "$$v_i \\cdot Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}] - E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[x_i \\cdot 1_{x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}}] \\geq v_i \\cdot Pr_{{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}}[x_i' \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}] - E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[x_i' \\cdot 1_{x_i' \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}}].$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"v_{i}\\cdot Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[x_{i}\\succsim\\mathbf{x}_{-i}]-E_{\\mathbf{x}%&#10;\\sim D}[x_{i}\\cdot 1_{x_{i}\\succsim\\mathbf{x}_{-i}}]\\geq v_{i}\\cdot Pr_{{%&#10;\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}}[x_{i}^{\\prime}\\succsim\\mathbf{x}_{-i}]-E_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}%&#10;[x_{i}^{\\prime}\\cdot 1_{x_{i}^{\\prime}\\succsim\\mathbf{x}_{-i}}].\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>P</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>\u223c</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u227f</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>\u223c</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mn>1</mn><mrow><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u227f</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2265</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>P</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>\u223c</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msubsup><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo>\u227f</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>\u223c</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msubsup><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mn>1</mn><mrow><msubsup><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2032</mo></msubsup><mo>\u227f</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07702.tex", "nexttext": "\nWe will think of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as Alice's and Bob's utilities at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nDefine $F(x) = \\min\\{ \\tfrac{\\alpha}{1-x}, \\tfrac{\\beta}{v-x} \\}$, for $x \\in [0,v]$.\nIn the equilibrium we\nconstruct, a value will be drawn from the distribution with CDF $F$ and both players will\nbid that value.

Thus every construction of\nan equilibrium that we provide using a particular tie-breaking rule immediately implies also\nan $\\epsilon$-equilibrium for any tie breaking rule and any $\\epsilon>0$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The Distribution on the Winning Price}\nWhen analysing revenue and welfare in an equilibrium,\nit will be most convenient to consider the single-dimensional distribution on the winning price, i.e., on\n\n$\\max_i\\{ x_i \\}$.\nWe will denote the cumulative distribution on the winning price by $F$.  The revenue\ncan be easily expressed in terms of $F$ as $Revenue = E_{x \\sim F}[x]  = \\int (1-F(x))dx$ (where the integration\nis over the support of the distribution.)\n\nThe starting point for our analysis of {\\em coarse equilibria} is the following.\nSuppose there are $n=2$ players, say Alice and Bob, with values $1$ and $v \\leq 1$ respectively.\nIf Alice chooses to deviate from the equilibrium to some fixed bid $x$, then her utility will be\n$(1-x)\\cdot F_{Bob}(x) \\ge (1-x) \\cdot F(x)$ (this expression ignores the possibility of a tie),\nwhere $F_{Bob}$ is the cumulative distribution of\nBob's bid, which is certainly stochastically dominated by the cumulative distribution on the winning bid.\nIn our constructions we will typically have both Alice and Bob always bidding the same value $x=y$ (where\nthis joint value is distributed\naccording to $F$), and thus will have $F_{Bob}=F$.\n\nDenoting Alice's utility at equilibrium by $\\alpha$, a necessary condition that this deviation is not profitable is thus\n$\\alpha \\ge (1-x)\\cdot F(x)$, i.e. that $F(x) \\le \\alpha/(1-x)$.  Similarly for Bob we must have\n$F(x) \\le \\beta/(v-x)$, where $\\beta$ is Bob's utility at equilibrium.  Thus if $F$ corresponds to a coarse equilibrium then it must be stochastically dominated\nby the minimum of these two expressions.\n\nThe following simple calculation\nstates the closed form expression for the revenue of a distribution of these forms.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{lem:expected}\nLet the cumulative distribution function $G=G_{a,b}$ be defined by\n$G(x)=a/(b-x)$ for $0 \\le x \\le b-a$.  Then, $E_G[x] = b-a+a \\ln (a/b)$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\section{Correlated equilibrium}\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of this section is to establish that every correlated equilibrium of a first-price auction is outcome-equivalent to a mixture of pure Nash equilibria.  We begin by showing that the winning bid is never lower than the second-highest of the players' values.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nFor every correlated equilibrium $D$,\n\n\n$Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\} < v_2]=0$\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nAssume otherwise.\n\nLet $S = \\{ p | Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\}<p]>0 \\}$, and let $p^*=\\inf(S)<v_2$.\nFix some $p^*<p<(p^*+v_2)/2$,\nfor which we thus have $Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\} < p]=\\delta>0$.\n\nConsider players $1$ and $2$.\nOne of the two players must be winning with probability of at most $\\delta/2$ (when $\\max_i\\{x_i\\} < p$), say player $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\n\nI.e., $Pr_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[p > x_j \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}]\\ge \\delta/2$.\n(recall that $x_j \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}$ means that either $x_j$ is strictly larger than the other bids, or that it is weakly larger and tie at that value is broken in favor of player $j$).\n\n\nNow let's consider the following deviation function $b_j$ for player $j$.  Choose $\\epsilon > 0$ so that $p+2\\epsilon < (p^*+v_2)/2$ (which is possible by the choice of $p$ above).  Then define $b_j(x_j) = p+\\epsilon$ for all $x_j \\le p$, and $b_j(x_j) = x_j$ for all $x_j > p$.  That is, when being told any value $x_j \\le p$, player $j$ bids instead $p+\\epsilon$.  On the up side,\nthis will certainly win all the cases where $\\max_i\\{x_i\\}<p$, increasing the probability of winning by at least $\\delta/2$ and thus increasing his utility by at least\n$\\delta\\cdot (v_2-p-\\epsilon)/2$.  On the down side, player $j$ now pays $p+\\epsilon$ when he wins rather than his original bid $x_j$.  Since player $j$ never won when $x_j<p^*$ (as $Pr_{\\mathbf{x}\\sim D}[\\max_i\\{x_i\\}<p^*]=0$, by definition of $p^*$) he pays at most $(p-p^*)+\\epsilon$ more whenever he wins, which happened with probability of at most $\\delta/2$.  Thus the down side of player $j$'s utility from deviation is at most $\\delta \\cdot (p-p^*+\\epsilon)/2$.  So the deviation is profitable whenever $\\delta\\cdot (v_2-p-\\epsilon)/2 > \\delta \\cdot (p-p^*+\\epsilon)/2$ which is the case due to our choice of $\\epsilon$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe next show that only the players with the highest value can ever win in a correlated equilibrium.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nFor every correlated equilibrium $D$, and for any player $i$ such that $v_i < v_1$, $Pr_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim D}[x_i \\succsim \\mathbf{x}_{-i}] = 0$.\n\n\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nBy the previous lemma, no one ever wins with a price that is strictly less than $v_2$.  On the other hand, if any player $i > 1$ ever wins with a price that is strictly more than $v_i$, their utility will be negative, making a deviation to a bid 0 profitable.  This immediately implies the desired result if $v_2 = v_1$, so from this point onward we will assume $v_2 < v_1$.\n\nThe only case we further need to consider is if some player $i \\geq 2$ with $v_i = v_2$ wins at price exactly $v_2$, say with some probability $\\delta > 0$.\n\nBut then player $1$ would prefer to deviate\nfrom any $x_1 \\le v_2$ to $v_2+\\epsilon$, gaining utility of at least $\\delta (v_1-v_2-\\epsilon)$ due to winning all cases in which $\\max_i\\{x_i\\} \\leq v_2$, and losing at most $\\epsilon$ due to the additional payment (since player $1$ never pays less than $v_2$ when she wins).  Choosing $\\epsilon$ small enough, this deviation becomes profitable.\n\\end{proof}\n\nIn conclusion we have a complete characterization of correlated equilibria is terms of their outcomes.  Clearly every mixture of pure equilibria is a correlated\nequilibrium, and this turns out to be all that is possible:\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nEvery correlated equilibrium of the single-item first-price auction is equivalent (in terms of winning probabilities and payments) to a mixture of pure equilibria\n(where Alice always wins the ties).\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nFirst suppose $v_1 > v_2$.  Since by the previous lemma player $1$ always wins, and never pays less than $v_2$, she must always bid at least $v_2$.  Clearly player $1$ can never bid more than $v_1$ since that will give her negative utility (as she does always win).  Thus player $1$'s bid $x_1$ is supported on the interval $[v_2,v_1]$ and she always wins.  The outcome is thus equivalent to that of a similar distribution on the pure equilibria in which all players bid $x \\in [v_2, v_1]$ (with player $1$ winning the ties).\n\nIf $v_1 = v_2$ then only the maximum-valued players ever win, and the winner always pays at least $v_1$.\nThe utility of every player is therefore exactly $0$.  The outcome is thus equivalent to a similar distribution on the pure equilibria, in which all players bid $v_1$ and ties are broken in favor of the appropriate maximum-value player.\n\n\n\\end{proof}\n\nOur characterization also implies that the revenue of the auctioneer is always at lease the second highest value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Price of Undominated Anarchy}\n\nThe following theorem shows that if players do not over bid, the welfare guarantee in any CCE improves from $63\\%$ to $81\\%$.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm-poua}\nIn every coarse equilibrium of the single-item first price auctioneer players\nnever bid above their value, the social\nwelfare is at least $0.813559...$ fraction of the optimal.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet us start by normalizing the values of the players in the auction: let us call\nthe player with highest value Alice, and normalize this value to 1, and let us call the player with\nsecond highest value Bob, so his value is $v \\le 1$.  There could be other players in the auction but our analysis\nwill ignore them.  Fix a coarse equilibrium\nof that auction.  Let us further denote Alice's utility in the equilibrium by $\\alpha$ and Bob's utility by $\\beta$.\nSince\nBob never uses undominated strategies, he always bids at most $v$ and thus\nAlice can always deviate to $v+\\epsilon$\nobtaining a utility of $1-v$.  hence we must have $\\alpha \\ge 1-v$.  Denote by $F_{CE}$ the cumulative distribution\non the price paid by the winner of the auction, so the fact that Alice does not want to deviate implies that\n$F_{CE}(x) \\le \\alpha/(1-x)$ for all $0 \\le x \\le 1-\\alpha$ and the fact that Bob does not want to deviate\nimplies that $F_{CE}(x) \\le \\beta/(v-x)$ for all $0 \\le x \\le v-\\beta$.

We now split again into two cases.\nIn the first case, this value\nof $\\beta$ is within the possible range,\n$(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1) < \\alpha v = \\alpha(1-\\alpha)$ and so the\nminimum is obtained at this value of $\\beta$, and the second case is where\n$(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1) > \\alpha (1-\\alpha)$ in which\ncase the minimum is obtained at the highest possible value of $\\beta=\\alpha (1-\\alpha)$.\n\nWe start with the second case of $\\beta=\\alpha(1-\\alpha)$ for which the welfare\nsimplifies to: $1-\\alpha^2+\\alpha+\\alpha log(\\alpha)$ which attains its minimum of $0.838...$\nat $\\alpha=0.203..$, where $\\alpha$ is the solution of $2-2x+\\log x = 0$.  (This is exactly the same point\nidentified above by our analysis above of the easy case of $\\beta \\ge \\alpha v$.)\n\nFor the first case where $\\beta=(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1)$, we plug in this\nvalue of $\\beta$ into the expression for welfare which then simplifies to\n$\\alpha log((e \\alpha)/((e-1) \\alpha+1))+1$ which attains its minimum of $0.813559...$\nat $\\alpha=0.274322...$, where $\\alpha$ is\nthe solution of $(((e-1) x+1) log((e x)/((e-1) x+1))+1)/((e-1) x+1)=0$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe now show that this bound is tight, by exhibiting an auction with\nmatching welfare.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm-poua-lb}\nThere exists a single-item two-player auction with player values\n$1$ and $v \\leq 1$, and a coarse equilibrium of that auction where\nplayers never bid above their values,\nwhose social welfare matches the bound from Theorem~\\ref{thm-poua} $(0.813559...)$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{proof}\nOur equilibrium will take a form developed in the proof of Theorem \\ref{thm-poua}.\nCall the player with value $1$ Alice, and the player with value $v \\leq 1$ Bob.\n\n\nGuided by the proof of Theorem~\\ref{thm-poua}, we will choose a parameter $\\alpha$,\nthen set\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:beta-v}\n\\beta=(\\alpha-\\alpha^2)/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\   \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ v = 1 - \\alpha.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\beta=(\\alpha-\\alpha^{2})/(e\\alpha-\\alpha+1)\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mbox{and}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ %&#10;v=1-\\alpha.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>-</mo><msup><mi>\u03b1</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>/</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003\u2003\u2003</mo><mtext>and</mtext></mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003\u2003\u2003</mo><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07702.tex", "nexttext": "\nWe first claim that if we are able to specify when Alice wins, so that she\nwins with probability $q$ and her utility is $\\alpha$, then it necessarily\nfollows that Bob will have utility $\\beta$.

Applying the calculation in the previous lemma,\nthe total revenue of\nthis auction is $1-e^{-1}+e^{-1} \\ln e^{-1} = 1-2e^{-1}$, and\neach player's utility is thus $e^{-1}$.  A possible deviation of one of the players to\n$x$ will yield utility $F(x)(1-x) = e^{-1}$ and is thus\nnot strictly profitable.  Thus we are indeed in a coarse equilibrium.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe show that the construction above is essentially the worst possible case across all first price auctions.\nWe first establish this bound for the two-bidder case, then prove the general theorem by reducing an auction with an arbitrary number of bidders and arbitrary values to the two-bidder case.\nTo state this\ncleanly, we will fix the value of the second highest bidder, Bob, to 1 and let Alice's value $v$ be any quantity that is at least $1$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nConsider a coarse equilibrium of the single-item 2-player first price auction\nwhere\nBob has value $1$ and Alice has value $v \\geq 1$.\n\nThen, the revenue\nof the seller is at least $1-2/e \\ge 0.26$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $p_1,p_2$ be the probabilities that Alice and Bob, respectively, win, and let $r_1,r_2$ be the total payments, respectively, of Alice and Bob.\nClearly $p_1+p_2=1$ and $r_1+r_2$ is exactly the revenue of the coarse equilibrium which for notational convince we will denote by\n$1-2\\alpha$ where, by way of contradiction, $\\alpha > 1/e$.   Thus\n$p_1+p_2-r_1-r_2 = 2\\alpha$ and for some $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ we have\nthat $p_i - r_i \\le \\alpha$.  Notice that for $i=2$ (Bob) $p_2-r_2$ is\nexactly Bob's utility, but for $i=1$, Alice's utility is $vp_1-r_1$.\n\nDenote by $F$ the cumulative distribution function of the price paid\nin the equilibrium.\nIf $p_2-r_2 \\le \\alpha$ then Bob will want to deviate from the equilibrium\nto a fixed bid $x$ whenever $F(x)(1-x) > \\alpha$.  It follows\nthat $F(x) \\le \\alpha/(1-x)$, and using the calculation in lemma \\ref{lem:expected}\nwe have that $E_F[x] \\ge 1-\\alpha + \\alpha \\ln \\alpha$.  But this expectation is exactly\nthe revenue of the auction thus\n$1-2\\alpha \\ge 1-\\alpha + \\alpha \\ln \\alpha$, which simplifies to\n$\\alpha \\le 1/e$ which is a contradiction to our choice of $\\alpha > 1/e$.\n\nWe now handle the second case where $p_1-r_1 \\le \\alpha$, in which\ncase we can bound the probability that Alice wins from above by $1-1/e$\n(since if Bob wins with probability less than $1/e$ then his utility is certainly less than $1/e$ which is already handled by the first case)\nand thus bound the utility of Alice by $vp_1-r_1 \\le \\alpha + p_1(v-1) \\le (1-1/e)(v-1) + \\alpha$.  Alice will\nprefer deviating to a fixed bid $x$ whenever\n$F(x)(v-x) > (1-1/e)(v-1) + \\alpha$\nso we have that $F(x) \\le ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/(v-x)$. Using Lemma~\\ref{lem:expected}\nwe have that\n$E_F[x] \\ge v - ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) + ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) \\ln (((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/v)$.\nIt remains to show that for any $1/e < \\alpha \\le 1$ and $v \\ge 1$, it holds that $v - ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) + ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) \\ln (((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/v) > 1-2 \\alpha$, or equivalently\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 35957, "prevtext": "\nwhich is positive on the range $\\alpha \\in [0.27, 0.28]$.

We will now construct an equilibrium\nof the two-player\nauction with values $v_1 \\ge v_2$ that has the same revenue as does the\noriginal auction.  After scaling, the main lemma bounds the revenue of the two-player auction to be at least $(1-2/e)v_2$ and so this is also\nthe bound on the original one.\n\nTo get the coarse equilibrium for the two player auction, simply take the same distribution on bids as in the original auction, but assigning the winning bids\nof players $i \\ge 3$ to one of the first two bidders (arbitrarily).  Notice\nthat since none of the players $i \\ge 3$ had a negative utility in the original\nauction (otherwise they would deviate to $0$),\nand furthermore, each of the\nfirst two players gets at least as much utility from winning as do\nany of the players $i \\ge 3$, thus we are only\nincreasing the utilities of the first and second player in the new equilibrium.  On the other hand, notice that we have not changed the utilities from deviations at all since these utilities depend only on the distribution of the winning price and not on the identity of the winner.  It follows that the first two players still do\nnot want to deviate and so we have a coarse equilibrium in the two-player game.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nWe remark that as the competition increases, the auctioneer's revenue grows.\nFor the case of two symmetric bidders (with value 1), Lemma \\ref{lem:rev-lb} shows a coarse equilibrium with revenue $1-2/e$.\nFor the case of $n$ symmetric bidders we show the following.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{th:rev-symmetric}\nIn every first price auction, with any number of symmetric bidders with value $v$, the revenue\nin every coarse equilibrium is at least $(1-\\frac{n}{e^{n-1}})v$. This is tight.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe first show that the revenue is always at least $(1-\\frac{n}{e^{n-1}})v$.\nLet $F$ be the distribution of the price. The sum of the bidders' utilities is $v-E[x]$ (where $x$ is distributed according to $F$). Clearly, one of them has utility at most $\\frac{1}{n}(v-E[x])$; denote this value by $\\alpha$. Since no deviation to any $x$ is profitable for that player, it holds that $F(x)(v-x) \\leq \\alpha$ for all $x$, that is $F(x) \\leq \\frac{\\alpha}{v-x}$. It follows that the expected value of $x$ according to $F$ is at least the expected value of $x$ according to the distribution $\\alpha/(v-x)$ which is $v-\\alpha+\\alpha \\ln(\\alpha/v)$ (by Lemma \\ref{lem:expected}). Substitute $E[x]=v-\\alpha n$ (by the definition of $\\alpha$) to get $\\alpha \\leq v/e^{n-1}$. It follows that $E[x] = v-\\alpha n \\geq v(1-\\frac{n}{e^{n-1}})$.\n\nWe now construct a CCE with revenue at most $(1-\\frac{n}{e^{n-1}})v$.\nConsider a profile where bidders bid $x$ according to the distribution $F(x)=\\alpha/(v-x)$, where $\\alpha=v/e^{n-1}$; and each bidder wins with probability $1/n$.\nThe expected payment is $E[x]=v-\\alpha+\\alpha \\ln (\\alpha/v)$.\nThe expected utility of a bidder is $1/n(v-E[x])$ and this should be at least $\\alpha$ (the deviation utility). Solving for $\\alpha$, we get $\\alpha \\leq v/e^{n-1}$.\nSo this is an equilibrium, and the revenue is $E[x]=v-\\alpha+\\alpha \\ln (\\alpha/v) = v(1-\\frac{n}{e^{n-1}})$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe can also show that as the gap between the highest value and the second highest value increases, the revenue must get close to the second highest value.  To state this\nin the cleanset way, we will fix the value of the second highest bidder, Bob, to 1 and let Alice's value $v$ approach infinity.\n\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nFor very $\\epsilon>0$ there exsits $v_0 = O(\\epsilon^{-4})$ such that in any auction where Alice has value $v \\ge v_0$ and Bob has value $1$ (and perhaps other players with other values), the revenue is at least $1-\\epsilon$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nAssume by way of contradiction that the total revenue is less than $1-\\epsilon$.  It follows that with probability of at least $\\epsilon/3$ the price paid by the winner\nis at most $1-\\epsilon/3$ (otherwise the reveneue would be bounded below by $(1-\\epsilon/3)^2 \\ge 1-\\epsilon$, for small enough $\\epsilon$).  It follows that Bob must win the item\nwith probability of at least $\\epsilon^2/9$ as otherwsie his utility would be less than that while deviating to $1-\\epsilon/3$ would ensure utility of at least that.  Now the bound\non the revenue implies that the probability that the wining price is very high, greater than $18/\\epsilon^2$ can be at most $\\epsilon^2/18$.  Now consider a deviation\nof Alice to $18/\\epsilon^2$: her probability of winning goes up by at least $\\epsilon^2/9-\\epsilon^2/18$ (the probability that Bob wins minus the probability of\nany bids above $18/\\epsilon^2$).  Her utility changes as follows: on the up side it increases by at least $\\epsilon^2 v / 18$ due to the increased winning probability, and on\nthe down side it decreases by at most $18/\\epsilon^2$ due to the increased price.

Applying the calculation in the previous lemma,\nthe total revenue of\nthis auction is $1-e^{-1}+e^{-1} \\ln e^{-1} = 1-2e^{-1}$, and\neach player's utility is thus $e^{-1}$.  A possible deviation of one of the players to\n$x$ will yield utility $F(x)(1-x) = e^{-1}$ and is thus\nnot strictly profitable.  Thus we are indeed in a coarse equilibrium.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe show that the construction above is essentially the worst possible case across all first price auctions.\nWe first establish this bound for the two-bidder case, then prove the general theorem by reducing an auction with an arbitrary number of bidders and arbitrary values to the two-bidder case.\nTo state this\ncleanly, we will fix the value of the second highest bidder, Bob, to 1 and let Alice's value $v$ be any quantity that is at least $1$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nConsider a coarse equilibrium of the single-item 2-player first price auction\nwhere\nBob has value $1$ and Alice has value $v \\geq 1$.\n\nThen, the revenue\nof the seller is at least $1-2/e \\ge 0.26$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $p_1,p_2$ be the probabilities that Alice and Bob, respectively, win, and let $r_1,r_2$ be the total payments, respectively, of Alice and Bob.\nClearly $p_1+p_2=1$ and $r_1+r_2$ is exactly the revenue of the coarse equilibrium which for notational convince we will denote by\n$1-2\\alpha$ where, by way of contradiction, $\\alpha > 1/e$.   Thus\n$p_1+p_2-r_1-r_2 = 2\\alpha$ and for some $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ we have\nthat $p_i - r_i \\le \\alpha$.  Notice that for $i=2$ (Bob) $p_2-r_2$ is\nexactly Bob's utility, but for $i=1$, Alice's utility is $vp_1-r_1$.\n\nDenote by $F$ the cumulative distribution function of the price paid\nin the equilibrium.\nIf $p_2-r_2 \\le \\alpha$ then Bob will want to deviate from the equilibrium\nto a fixed bid $x$ whenever $F(x)(1-x) > \\alpha$.  It follows\nthat $F(x) \\le \\alpha/(1-x)$, and using the calculation in lemma \\ref{lem:expected}\nwe have that $E_F[x] \\ge 1-\\alpha + \\alpha \\ln \\alpha$.  But this expectation is exactly\nthe revenue of the auction thus\n$1-2\\alpha \\ge 1-\\alpha + \\alpha \\ln \\alpha$, which simplifies to\n$\\alpha \\le 1/e$ which is a contradiction to our choice of $\\alpha > 1/e$.\n\nWe now handle the second case where $p_1-r_1 \\le \\alpha$, in which\ncase we can bound the probability that Alice wins from above by $1-1/e$\n(since if Bob wins with probability less than $1/e$ then his utility is certainly less than $1/e$ which is already handled by the first case)\nand thus bound the utility of Alice by $vp_1-r_1 \\le \\alpha + p_1(v-1) \\le (1-1/e)(v-1) + \\alpha$.  Alice will\nprefer deviating to a fixed bid $x$ whenever\n$F(x)(v-x) > (1-1/e)(v-1) + \\alpha$\nso we have that $F(x) \\le ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/(v-x)$. Using Lemma~\\ref{lem:expected}\nwe have that\n$E_F[x] \\ge v - ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) + ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) \\ln (((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/v)$.\nIt remains to show that for any $1/e < \\alpha \\le 1$ and $v \\ge 1$, it holds that $v - ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) + ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) \\ln (((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/v) > 1-2 \\alpha$, or equivalently\n\n", "index": 31, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:1}\nv - ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) + ((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha) \\ln (((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/v) - 1 + 2 \\alpha > 0,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"v-((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)+((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)\\ln(((1-1/e)(v-1)+\\alpha)/v)-1+2%&#10;\\alpha&gt;0,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
