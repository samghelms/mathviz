A finite subset $E$ of the edge set of\n  $\\Theta$ is called a set of \\emph{cutting edges} {if and only if } $\\Theta - E$\n  is disconnected and has at least two infinite components.\n\n  A \\emph{cut} $C$ is the union of all vertices contained in an\n  infinite connected complementary component of some set of cutting\n  edges. The \\emph{boundary} of $C$ consists of all edges with exactly\n  one endpoint in $C$.\n\n  Given two cuts $C$ and $D$, we call them \\emph{nested} {if and only if } $C$ or\n  its complement $C^*$ is contained in $D$ or its complement $D^*$. Note that $C^\\ast$ and $D^\\ast$ do not need to be cuts.\n\\end{dfn}\n\n\nWe first aim to show the following theorem which is implicit in\n\\cite{Kroen2010}.\n\\begin{thm}[\\cite{Kroen2010}]\n\\label{thm: kroen}\nSuppose that $\\Theta$ is a connected graph on which a group $G$ acts.\nLet $\\mathcal P$ be a property of subsets of the edge set of $\\Theta$,\nwhich is stable under the $G$-action, taking subsets and unions.  If\nthere exists a set of cutting edges with $\\mathcal P$, then there exists a\ncut $C$ whose boundary has $\\mathcal P$, such that the cuts $C$ and $g.C$ are\nnested for any $g \\in G$, and such that $C^\\ast$ is also a cut.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]\n  In order to prove this, we recall the following terminology, roughly\n  following Dunwoody. We say that $C$ is a $\\mathcal{P}$-cut, if its\n  boundary has $\\mathcal{P}$. Say that a $\\mathcal{P}$-cut is\n  \\emph{$\\mathcal{P}$-narrow}, if its boundary contains the minimal\n  number of elements among all $\\mathcal{P}$-cuts.  Note that for each\n  $\\mathcal{P}$-narrow cut $C$, the complement $C^\\ast$ is also a cut,\n  as otherwise we could remove some edges from the boundary of $C$ and\n  get another $\\mathcal{P}$-cut.\n\nGiven any edge $e$ with $\\mathcal{P}$, there are finitely many\n$\\mathcal{P}$-narrow cuts which contain $e$ in its boundary.\nThis is shown by Dunwoody \\cite[2.5]{Dunwoody1982} for narrow cuts,\nand the proof carries over to the $\\mathcal{P}$-narrow\ncase. Similarly, Kr\\\"on \\cite[Lemma 2.1]{Kroen2010} shows this for sets of\ncutting edges which cut the graph into exactly two connected\ncomponents, and $\\mathcal{P}$-narrow cuts have this property.\n\nNow, consider for each $\\mathcal{P}$-cut $C$ the number $m(C)$ of\n$\\mathcal{P}$-cuts which are not nested with $C$ (this is finite by\nthe remark above). Call a $\\mathcal{P}$-cut \\emph{optimally nested} if\n$m(C)$ is smallest amongst all $\\mathcal{P}$-cuts. The proof of\nTheorem~3.3 of \\cite{Kroen2010} now shows that optimally nested\n$\\mathcal{P}$-cuts are all nested with each other\\footnote{Kr\\\"on's proof\ninvolves intersections of cuts, which by Kr\\\"on's definition need\nnot be cuts (he assumes that the a cut and its complement is connected) -- this\ndoes not actually pose a major problem; and does not appear when our definition of a cut is used.}.\nThis shows Theorem~\\ref{thm: kroen}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nTo use that theorem, recall\n\n\\begin{thm}[{\\cite[Theorem 4.1]{Dunwoody1982}}]\n\\label{thm: dunwoody}\nSuppose that there exists a cut $C$, such that\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item $C^\\ast$ is also a cut; and\n \\item there exists $g \\in G$ such that $g.C$ is properly contained in $C$ or $C^\\ast$; and\n \\item $C$ and $h.C$ are\nnested for any $h \\in G$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nLet $E$ be the boundary of $C$.\nThen $G$ splits over the stabiliser of $E$\n(which is a finite group), and the stabiliser of any component of\n$\\Theta - G.

If\nthere exists a set of cutting edges with $\\mathcal P$, then there exists a\ncut $C$ whose boundary has $\\mathcal P$, such that the cuts $C$ and $g.C$ are\nnested for any $g \\in G$, and such that $C^\\ast$ is also a cut.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}[Sketch of proof]\n  In order to prove this, we recall the following terminology, roughly\n  following Dunwoody. We say that $C$ is a $\\mathcal{P}$-cut, if its\n  boundary has $\\mathcal{P}$. Say that a $\\mathcal{P}$-cut is\n  \\emph{$\\mathcal{P}$-narrow}, if its boundary contains the minimal\n  number of elements among all $\\mathcal{P}$-cuts.  Note that for each\n  $\\mathcal{P}$-narrow cut $C$, the complement $C^\\ast$ is also a cut,\n  as otherwise we could remove some edges from the boundary of $C$ and\n  get another $\\mathcal{P}$-cut.\n\nGiven any edge $e$ with $\\mathcal{P}$, there are finitely many\n$\\mathcal{P}$-narrow cuts which contain $e$ in its boundary.\nThis is shown by Dunwoody \\cite[2.5]{Dunwoody1982} for narrow cuts,\nand the proof carries over to the $\\mathcal{P}$-narrow\ncase. Similarly, Kr\\\"on \\cite[Lemma 2.1]{Kroen2010} shows this for sets of\ncutting edges which cut the graph into exactly two connected\ncomponents, and $\\mathcal{P}$-narrow cuts have this property.\n\nNow, consider for each $\\mathcal{P}$-cut $C$ the number $m(C)$ of\n$\\mathcal{P}$-cuts which are not nested with $C$ (this is finite by\nthe remark above). Call a $\\mathcal{P}$-cut \\emph{optimally nested} if\n$m(C)$ is smallest amongst all $\\mathcal{P}$-cuts. The proof of\nTheorem~3.3 of \\cite{Kroen2010} now shows that optimally nested\n$\\mathcal{P}$-cuts are all nested with each other\\footnote{Kr\\\"on's proof\ninvolves intersections of cuts, which by Kr\\\"on's definition need\nnot be cuts (he assumes that the a cut and its complement is connected) -- this\ndoes not actually pose a major problem; and does not appear when our definition of a cut is used.}.\nThis shows Theorem~\\ref{thm: kroen}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nTo use that theorem, recall\n\n\\begin{thm}[{\\cite[Theorem 4.1]{Dunwoody1982}}]\n\\label{thm: dunwoody}\nSuppose that there exists a cut $C$, such that\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item $C^\\ast$ is also a cut; and\n \\item there exists $g \\in G$ such that $g.C$ is properly contained in $C$ or $C^\\ast$; and\n \\item $C$ and $h.C$ are\nnested for any $h \\in G$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nLet $E$ be the boundary of $C$.\nThen $G$ splits over the stabiliser of $E$\n(which is a finite group), and the stabiliser of any component of\n$\\Theta - G.

Let $u$ be such a vertex. Its stabiliser is a conjugate of $G_v$; pick once and for all a conjugating element $x$.\nWe now blow up $u$ by $X_u = X$, and attach the edges in the following way: each edge $f$ emanating form $u$ is the image under $x$ of some $e$ emanating from $w$; we attach $f$ to $p_e \\in X = X_w$.\nThe space $Y$ we constructed this way certainly satisfies (1).\n\n\\smallskip\n\nNow we are going to construct an action of $\\pi_1(G)$ on\n$Y$.

We say that the metric space $Y$ is a \\emph{blow-up} of $T$ at $v$ by $X$ {if and only if } $X$ embeds into $Y$, and collapsing $X$ to a point yields an isometry onto $T$ which collapses $X$ onto $v$.\n\\end{dfn}\nWe warn the reader that our notion of blow-up is not standard terminology\n(and has nothing to do with blow-ups in other fields).\n\n\\begin{prop}\n\\label{blow up}\nLet $G$ be a graph of groups with finite edge groups. Let $G_v$ be the vertex group associated to $v$, and suppose that $G_v$ acts on a complete CAT(0) space $X$. Then there exists a complete CAT(0) space $Y$ on which $\\pi_1(G)$ acts, satisfying the following:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item $Y$ is obtained from the universal cover $\\widetilde G$ by blowing up each preimage $u$ of $v$ by $X_u = X$;\n \\item the restricted action of $G_v$ on $Y$ preserves $X_w$, where $w$ is the vertex in $\\widetilde G$ fixed by $G_v$, and the induced action is the given action of $G_v$ on $X_w = X$;\n \\item collapsing each $X_u$ individually to a point is $\\pi_1(G)$-equivariant, and the resulting tree with the $\\pi_1(G)$-action is equivariantly isomorphic to $\\widetilde G$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $w$ be the vertex defined in (2). We start by blowing $\\widetilde G$ up at $w$ by $X$; such a blow-up will be defined by the way edges emanating from $w$ are attached to $X$: let $e$ be such an edge. Its stabiliser is a finite subgroup of $G_v$ by assumption, and hence there is a point $p_e \\in X$ fixed by the given action $G_v \\curvearrowright X$ (since $X$ is a complete CAT(0) space). We attach the edge $e$ to this point $p_e$.\nLet $e'$ be another edge in the $G_v$-orbit of $e$. There exists $x \\in G_v$ taking $e$ to $e'$, and we attach $e'$ at $x . p_e$. This way we attach all edges in the orbit of $e$, and then we proceed to attach edges in the remaining orbits in the same way.\n\nNow we are going to blow up the other vertices in the preimage of $v$. Let $u$ be such a vertex. Its stabiliser is a conjugate of $G_v$; pick once and for all a conjugating element $x$.\nWe now blow up $u$ by $X_u = X$, and attach the edges in the following way: each edge $f$ emanating form $u$ is the image under $x$ of some $e$ emanating from $w$; we attach $f$ to $p_e \\in X = X_w$.\nThe space $Y$ we constructed this way certainly satisfies (1).\n\n\\smallskip\n\nNow we are going to construct an action of $\\pi_1(G)$ on\n$Y$.  Let us take $z \\in \\pi_1(G)$ and $p\\in Y$. If $p$ lies outside\nany of the $X_u$, then $z.p$ is defined to be the unique point in $Y$\nmapping onto $z.p \\in \\widetilde G$ under the map collapsing each\n$X_u$ individually to a point.\n\n\n Now let us suppose that $p \\in X_u$ for some $u$. Let $u' = z.u \\in \\widetilde G$. We have the identification $X_u = X = X_{u'}$, and when constructing $Y$ we picked elements $x_1, x_2 \\in \\pi_1(G)$ such that ${\\mathrm{Stab}}(u) = x_1 G_v {x_1}^{-1}$ and ${\\mathrm{Stab}}(u') = x_2 G_v {x_2}^{-1}$.

We obtain a graph of groups $P$ with\none edge and a finite edge group, such that each $A_i$ lies up to\nconjugation in a vertex group.\n\n\\smallskip\nLet $v$ be a vertex of $\\widetilde P$. The group $P_v$ is a finite extension of $A \\cap P_v$ by a subgroup $H_v$ of $H$.\n\nLet us look at the structure of $P_{v} \\cap A$ more closely. To this\nend, consider the graph of groups associated to the product $A_1 \\ast\n\\dots A_n \\ast B$ and apply Kurosh's theorem~\\cite[Theorem I.14]{serre2003} to the subgroup $P_{v} \\cap\nA$. We obtain that $P_{v} \\cap A$ is a free product of groups of the form $P_{v}\n\\cap x A_i x^{-1}$ for some $x \\in A$, and a free group.\n\nLet us suppose that the intersection $P_{v} \\cap x A_i x^{-1} $ is non-trivial for some $i$ and $x \\in A$. This implies that a non-trivial subgroup of $A_i$ fixes the vertex $x^{-1} .v$. Since $A_i$ is torsion-free, this subgroup is infinite. We also know that $A_i$ fixes some vertex, say $v_i$, in $\\widetilde P$, and thus so does the infinite subgroup we are discussing. But edge stabilisers are finite, and so $v_i = x^{-1} .v$.\n\nNow suppose that $P_{v} \\cap y A_i y^{-1}$ is non-trivial for some other element $y \\in A$. Then $x^{-1}.v = v_i = y^{-1} .v$, and so $x y^{-1} \\in A \\cap P_v$. This implies that the two free factors $P_{v} \\cap x A_i x^{-1}$ and $P_{v} \\cap y A_i y^{-1}$ of $P_v \\cap A$ are conjugate inside the group, and so they must coincide.\n\nNote also that $P_{v} \\cap y A_i y^{-1}$ being non-trivial forces $ y A_i y^{-1} \\leqslant P_v$.\n\nThis discussion shows that $P_v \\cap A$ is is a free product of at most $n$ non-trivial factors of the form $x A_i x^{-1}$ (at most one for each $i$), and a free group.\n\n\n\n\n\\smallskip\n\nKurosh's theorem applied to $A \\leqslant \\pi_1(P) = \\overline A$ tells us that $A$ is a free product of conjugates of its intersections with the vertex groups and a free group. In particular $P_v \\cap A$ is a free factor of $A$, and hence it has at most the same complexity (by the discussion above), and the equality of complexitites is equivalent to $P_v \\cap A = A$.\nSince the splitting $P$ defines is non-trivial, the index of $P_v \\cap A$ in $\\overline A$ is infinite, and thus $A$ is not a subgroup of $P_v$. We immediately conclude that the complexity of $A \\cap P_v$ is strictly lower than that of $A$.\n\nWe have thus shown that $P_v$ is an extension\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 24512, "prevtext": "\n be a monomorphism with a finite domain, and let\n", "index": 19, "text": "\n\\[A = A_1 \\ast \\dots \\ast A_n \\ast B\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex16.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"A=A_{1}\\ast\\dots\\ast A_{n}\\ast B\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2217</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>\u2217</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>\u2217</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02187.tex", "nexttext": " apply the previous paragraph, and declare $H$ to act on the resulting space with $\\ker \\phi$ in the kernel.\n\n \\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\nIn the above theorem the hypothesis on the spaces $X_i$ being complete and  NPC can be replaced by the condition that they are semi-locally simply connected, and any finite group acting on their universal covering fixes at least one point.\n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\nOn the other hand, when we strengthen the hypothesis and require the spaces $X_i$ to be NPC cube complexes (with the actions of our finite groups preserving the combinatorial structure), then we may arrange for $X$ to also be a cube complex.\nWhen constructing the blow ups, we may always take the fixed points of the finite groups to be midpoints of cubes, and then $X$ is naturally a cube complex, when we take the cubical barycentric subdivisions of the complexes $X_i$ instead of the original cube complexes $X_i$.\n\\end{rmk}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n  In \\cite{hop} Osajda, Przytycki and the first-named author develop a more topological approach to Nielsen realisation and the\n  Karrass--Pietrowski--Solitar theorem.
