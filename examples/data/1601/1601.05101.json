It is alternately known as Kriging and Wiener-Kolmogorov prediction, and was first described in the astrophysical literature by \\citet{1992ApJ...398..169R} as a means of interpolating irregularly spaced data.  The technique was used to model instrumental systematics in exoplanet observations by \\citet{2012MNRAS.419.2683G} and first applied to {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC data by \\citet{2015MNRAS.451..680E}.   \n\nFor the Data Challenge, the GP analysis by T. Evans started with a maximum likelihood fit to the eclipse depth, mid-eclipse time, and the variance in the white noise, plus a set of parameters for kernel functions describing how the {\\it covariance} between two photometric measurements varies with their distance in pixel ($x,y$) and time.  The covariance kernel functions are used analagously to the kernel regression function described below, except the standard kernel regression is applied directly to the photometry.  Uncertainties for the eclipse parameters were obtained using MCMC with Metropolis-Hastings sampling in the region of maximum likelihood.  In the final MCMC step the covariance kernel parameters and white noise variance were held fixed to allow rapid evaluation of the likelihood.  One drawback to the GP method is the evaluation of the $N\\times N$ empirical covariance matrix among $N$ data points is often prohibitive with large datasets.  To avoid this difficulty, fluxes and centroids were binned as a function of time in groups of $\\sim 30\\,$s, resulting in $N\\sim 1000$ data points in each eclipse light curve \\citep[see][for more details]{2015MNRAS.451..680E}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Independent component analysis (ICA)}\nIndependent component analysis is a non-parametric technique for separating blended signals, with little specific {\\it a priori} knowledge of their structure.  This is the classic ``cocktail party problem'' of signal processing, which attempts to mimic the human brain's innate capacity for hearing multiple speakers in a crowded room \\citep{Hyvarinen:2000ho}.  In contrast to {\\it principle} component analysis, ICA does not assume that the statistically independent signals follow Gaussian distributions, and in fact attempts to maximize the {\\it non}-Gaussianity after separation.  The methods of ICA were first developed for exoplanet light curve analysis by \\citet{2012ApJ...747...12W} and used on {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data by \\citet{2014ApJ...786...22M}.  \n\n\nThe ICA data reduction of the XO-3 b real and simulated eclipse datasets, by G. Morello, used a new ``wavelet-pixel'' variant on the approach introduced in \\citet{2014ApJ...786...22M} and \\citet{2015ApJ...808...56M} for transits.  In this variant, the source separation operates on wavelet-transformed individual pixel light curves, after which the resulting components are transformed back to the time domain.  The wavelet transform was useful for enhancing the signal to noise ratio in the lower frequency instrument systematics components prior to ICA.   By operating on the individual pixel light curves, ICA circumvents a built-in degeneracy that occurs for most decorrelation techniques, which decorrelate aperture fluxes using ($x,y$) centroids.\\footnote{Since flux and centroid are both weighted sums of pixel intensities (center-of-light centroids are linear sums, whereas Gaussian fits are effectively nonlinear sums), flux and centroid are always correlated {\\it by definition}.  This intrinsic correlation effectively adds ``noise'' to the flux vs. centroid signal. }  \n\nThe sum of an eclipse light curve model (including a linear phase variation) and scaled versions of the non-eclipse independent components was then fit to the raw light curve.  An Adaptive Metropolis MCMC algorithm with delayed rejection produced chains of 300,000 values to serve as samples of the posterior distributions of the fit parameters.  These distributions yielded estimates of the parameters and their uncertainties.  The final error bars were then increased to include the ICA component separation error.  A full description of the implementation of ICA on the XO-3b real dataset is given by \\citet{Morello:2016wq}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Kernel regression (KR/Data, KR/PMap)}\nKernel regression is the earliest nonparametric technique used to measure and correct the intra-pixel sensitivity of the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC InSb detectors.  In mathematics and engineering, the general use of kernel-based methods was originally applied to the estimation of density functions (eg., histograms).  Eventually they were proposed as potential tools for regression (i.e., the fitting or prediction of function values) \\citep{Nadaraya:2006de,Watson:1964kb}.  The kernel regression estimator is a weighted average of the measured data, with a kernel function specifying how the weight decreases with distance from the target point {\\bf X} to be estimated.  Limiting the contributing data points to the $k$ nearest neighbors to the target is an additional expedient for faster computation \\citep{Stone:1977ey}.  The first application of kernel regression to estimate the intra-pixel response in {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ photometry was done by \\citet{2010PASP..122.1341B}.  The use of the Noise Pixel parameter, $\\tilde{\\beta}$, as a third component of the distance metric of the weighting kernel (in addition to $x$ and $y$ pixel centroid) was first described by \\citet{2013ApJ...766...95L}.\n\nThe most commonly used version of kernel regression, KR/Data, uses the data to be corrected as its own ``training set,'' i.e., the data (except the single datum being corrected) are used in the kernel average to obtain the correction.  This requires that the observations contain sufficient redundancy in positioning to allow estimation of its own correlated noise via the inverse distance-weighted average, even in the presence of temporal variations in the astrophysical source.  The published reduction of the real XO-3b eclipse dataset, described in \\citet{2014ApJ...794..134W}, used KR/Data.  A complementary analysis of the synthetic XO-3b dataset was performed by I. Wong for the Data Challenge.  For both analyses only $x$ and $y$ centroid (as measured using the center of light technique; see \\S3.1) were used in the kernel's distance metric, but $\\tilde{\\beta}$ was employed for most eclipses as a scale factor in determining the optimal aperture size for the photometry. \\citeauthor{2014ApJ...794..134W} chose $k=50$ nearest neighbors for the weighted sums.  They fit the data in two ways: each epoch separately, and all epochs combined.  The separate fits were only concerned with the eclipse depth, time of mid-eclipse, and linear slope of phase curve, whereas the global fits also included the planet-to-star radius ratio, the orbital inclination, and the semi-major axis to stellar radius.  Both fits were performed using a Levenberg--Marquardt (L-M) nonlinear least squares algorithm. They then used both a prayer-bead method and a MCMC routine to estimate the distributions of each parameter and their uncertainties, and reported the largest uncertainty of the two methods. \n\nA variation on the kernel regression technique, KR/Pmap, uses the photometry of a separate calibration star as the training set for the regression (Krick et al., submitted).  For each science data point to be corrected, the $k$ nearest neighbors in the pixel mapping (pmap) dataset are found, based on the Euclidean distance in $x$ and $y$ centroid and $\\tilde{\\beta}$.  Similarly to the KR/Data implementation, $k=50$ was chosen.  The kernel-weighted pmap data are then summed and normalized by the calibration star flux averaged over the pixel.  The potential benefit of KR/Pmap over KR/Data is that the correction is not built from the science measurements themselves, and therefore time-varying astrophysical signal does not contribute to the kernel averages.  On the other hand, detector variability (eg., latent charge) may differ between the calibration star measurements and those of the data to be corrected, and bias the regression.\n\nThe KR/Pmap analysis of the Data Challenge measuremements was performed by J. Krick.  Different calibration datasets were used to correct the real and synthetic XO-3b measurements.  For the real data, the {\\sl Spitzer} Science Center (SSC) has accumulated approximately 400,000 pixel mapping measurements of BD+67 1044, a star that is not known to vary, which are positioned near the ``sweet spot'' (peak of response) of the Ch 2 (4.5\\micron) subarray pixel (15,15). Since the IRAC simulator uses an idealized PRF that cannot replicate the detailed structure of the actual pixel response, the real BD +67 1044 dataset is not appropriate for reduction of simulated data.  Instead, a synthetic pixel mapping set was created.  The measurements were designed to mimic the actual pmap measurements of BD +67 1044, with similar source flux, integration parameters, mapping centers, and number of data points.  The pointing model parameters were taken from the same ranges as for the XO-3b simulations (Table \\ref{ptg_params}), to approximate realistic motions during integration and sampling. \n\nEclipse parameters were derived from the KR/Pmap-decorrelated data by fitting a \\citet{2002ApJ...580L.171M} light curve shape with no phase trend using an L-M nonlinear least squares algorithm.  The uncertainties returned were solely the formal uncertainties in the L-M fit, and should be considered underestimates.  As a check on the results, Transit Analysis Package (TAP) \\citep{2012AdAst2012E..30G} was also used to fit the eclipses, after setting the limb darkening coefficients to zero.  While the uncertainties tended to be more realistic under TAP's MCMC analysis, the eclipse depths themselves were systematically low compared to both the L-M fit and the mean of the other techniques.  We therefore decided to use the L-M results and assess the uncertainties using the ``overdispersion factor'' described in \\S3.2.\n\n\\subsubsection{Pixel level decorrelation (PLD)}\nThe pixel level decorrelation technique \\citep{2015ApJ...805..132D} is a parametric method that expresses the correlated noise in terms of a Taylor expansion sum of individual pixel values, instead of a function of centroid position.  The Taylor expansion partial derivatives become linear coefficients multiplying the (normalized) pixel values, a function that can be fit and removed.  Like with ICA, using the individual pixel values avoids the flux/centroid degeneracy inherent in most decorrelation methods.  \n\nThe PLD reduction of the Data Challenge observations, by D. Deming, used 2D Gaussian centroiding \\citep{2010ApJ...721.1861A} only to determine where to place the circular aperture, but not as a decorrelation variable.  An eclipse function was fit to the photometry simultaneously with the pixel coefficients and a quadratic phase curve \\citep[see][Equation 4]{2015ApJ...805..132D}.  Due to time limitations, a full MCMC analysis of uncertainties was not possible, so error bars were estimated using the slope of the standard deviation vs. bin size relationship for the residuals \\citep[as described in][]{2015ApJ...805..132D} to extrapolate to bins of width the eclipse duration.  \n\n\\subsubsection{Segmented Polynomial, K2 Pipeline [SP(K2)]}\nThe segmented polynomial algorithm was originally developed for use with K2 data \\citep{Buzasi:2015vo}, where detrending is normally required due to the presence of spacecraft pointing resets, and other less significant sources of correlated noise. The approach is reminiscent of polynomial surface fitting as used on {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data, but with some differences.  Detrending is carried out in two stages.  In the first stage, a third-order polynomial is fit to the flux vs.\\,($x,y$) centroid for the entire time series and removed.  This process is repeated, with successive third order polynomial fits being applied to each set of residuals, until there is $< 1\\%$ further reduction in the high-frequency noise standard deviation. In the second stage, the resulting time series is divided into segments, each of which is iteratively decorrelated using polynomial fitting. This segmented detrending is repeated for 10 different segment lengths between 0.04 and 0.125 of the total time series length, and the final time series is the result of applying a median filter to the 10 results.\n\nSP(K2) detrending was applied to the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ Data Challenge measurements by D. Buzasi.  Due to time limitations a simple box function was used to fit the eclipse profile, and the uncertainties reported are formal fit errors.  \n\nNo attempt was made to tune SP(K2) for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data. Future analysis might benefit from adjustment of the segmentation and fitting strategy.  For K2, the segmentation is partially necessary to accommodate unpredictable discontinuous jumps in source position when the pointing is reset, but this is not as much of an issue for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ staring mode observations (except for observations longer than 12 hours, for which there will be predictable pointing resets).  Furthermore, IRAC's intra-pixel gain variations are much larger than those of K2---the gain of IRAC varies by $\\sim 8\\%$ in Ch 1 (3.6\\micron) and $\\sim 4\\%$ in Ch 2 (4.5\\micron) across a pixel, whereas the K2 effect is only about 2\\%.  {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data might be more amenable to spatial, rather than temporal, segmentation of the data in stage 2.  \n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{XO-3b Centroids and Photometry}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\plotone{x03b_dc15_positions.eps}\n\\caption{Centroid positions of XO-3 on the IRAC 4.5\\,$\\mu$m subarray, from the {\\bf real} dataset.

The background grayscale and contours shows the intra-pixel photometric gain map (``Pmap''), as measured using kernel regression on a simulated calibration star.\\label{xo3b_pos_fake}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n \nWe begin with an overview of the data characteristics.  Figure \\ref{xo3b_pos_real} plots all centroid positions for the individual measurements on the subarray center pixel for the real data, and Figure \\ref{xo3b_pos_fake} does the same for the simulated data.  Because of the dependence of correlated noise on pointing fluctuations, most noise-removal techniques use source centroid as a primary decorrelation variable.  Most techniques described in \\S2.4 use either 2D Gaussian fitting  or the flux-weighted ``center of light'' method to determine a point source center on the undersampled {\\sl Spitzer} arrays. In this paper, if not stated otherwise, we only report center of light centroids:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx_c & = & \\frac{\\sum_i i\\,(f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}{\\sum_i (f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}; \\label{x_centroid}\\\\\ny_c & = & \\frac{\\sum_j j\\,(f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}{\\sum_j (f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}\\label{y_centroid}. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, ($i,j$) is the pixel number, $f_{ij}$ is the image value at that pixel, and $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG}$ is the background flux in surrounding pixels.  The sums are over a ($7\\times 7$)-pixel region surrounding the expected position of the source.   This centroiding method is sufficiently precise for decorrelation, resulting in positional distortions of at most 0.05 pixels \\citep{2014SPIE.9143E..1MI}. \\citep[There is some disagreement as to the adequacy of center-of-light centroiding; see for example][]{2014PASP..126.1092L}.\n\nColumns 4--8 of Tables \\ref{xo3meas} (real) and \\ref{sim_xo3meas} (simulated) summarize the centroid ``clouds'' for each epoch, giving the means and standard deviations in $x$ and $y$ position, as well as the $xy$ covariances in centroid.  As the real data were all pointed using PCRS peak-up, the mean positions are all within 0.4 pixel of one another, and cluster near the peak of the intra-pixel gain.  Negative covariances for most of the real AORs indicate that the clouds are aligned such that $y$ decreases when $x$ increases, which is a common direction for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC short-term drift.  The bottom 2 rows of Tables \\ref{xo3meas} and \\ref{sim_xo3meas} list the column means and the statistics for all data taken together.  For the real data, the full dataset has a much higher negative covariance than the individual clouds, suggesting that separate pointings fall preferentially along a $\\sim -45\\arcdeg$ axis.  The simulated data feature a much stronger initial drift, as well as a more pronounced $y$ component to the jitter, wobble, and drift than the real data.  Some individual $xy$ covariances in the simulated data are much higher than both the mean and the aggregate covariance for the group, due to this exaggerated elongation.  This ``stretching'' of the positions along $y$ reduces the positional redundancy and, as we will see, challenges the ability of most reduction methods to decorrelate the data.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\n\n\\plotone{x03b_dc15_raw_lightcurves.eps}\n\\caption{{\\bf Real} XO-3b photometric and other measurements as a function of orbital phase (fraction of orbit since transit).

We have re-analyzed an existing 4.5\\micron\\ dataset, consisting of 10 observations of the XO-3 b system during secondary eclipse, using 7 different techniques for removing correlated noise.  We find that, on average, for a given technique the eclipse depth estimate is repeatable from epoch to epoch to within 150 parts per million (ppm).  Most techniques derive eclipse depths that do not vary by more than a factor 2 of the photon noise limit.  Nearly all methods accurately assess their own errors: for these methods the individual measurement uncertainties are comparable to the scatter in eclipse depths over the 10-epoch sample.  To assess the accuracy of the techniques as well as clarify the difference between instrumental and other sources of measurement error, we have also analyzed a simulated dataset of 10 visits to XO-3 b, for which the eclipse depth is known.  We find that three of the methods (BLISS mapping, Independent Component Analysis, and Pixel Level Decorrelation) obtain results that are within 2 times the photon limit of the true eclipse depth.

At infrared wavelengths secondary eclipses are a powerful tool for studying the atmospheres of giant exoplanets, their depths approximately equaling the dayside planet-to-star flux ratio.\n\nExtracting information about atmospheres, however, is extremely challenging due to the small differential signals produced by transits, secondary eclipses, and phase curves.   The relevant signals are often at the level of 100 parts per million (ppm) or smaller, and require the removal of significant instrumental systematics in the two infrared instruments currently capable of providing information at this precision: the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the {\\sl Hubble Space Telecope} (HST) and the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC, \\citealt{2004ApJS..154...10F}) aboard the {\\sl Spitzer} Space Telescope \\citep{2004ApJS..154....1W}.  For the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5\\,$\\mu$m InSb detectors that remain active on post-cryogenic {\\sl Spitzer}, the systematics are due to the interplay of residual telescope pointing fluctuations with intra-pixel gain variations in the moderately under-sampled camera.  \n\nOver the past decade, a suite of techniques for removing time-correlated noise in IRAC data has been developed.  Because of the known coupling between pointing variations and the intra-pixel gain, the earliest methods for correcting cryogenic data used either a simple radial function \\citep{Reach:2005ji} or fit a second order polynomial to the observed flux variations as a function of the source centroid position \\citep[eg.,][]{2008ApJ...686.1341C}.  It soon became clear, however, that a single polynomial surface does not sufficiently describe the intra-pixel gain variations. To measure flux decrements with precision less than $\\sim 1$\\%, a more responsive approach is necessary to track the small-scale structure in the gain \\citep{2010PASP..122.1341B}.  Furthermore, after {\\sl Spitzer} entered its post-cryogenic stage in mid-2009, the amplitude of the variations doubled at the current detector temperature of about $28.7\\,$K.\\footnote{http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/irac/\\\\ calibrationfiles/pixelphase/}  \n\nThus, more flexible nonparametric approaches were developed to measure and remove the systematics.  The earliest such methods used some form of nearest neighbor kernel regression to map the intra-pixel gain as a function of centroid position, using a weighted sum of the measured fluxes instead of a predetermined function of centroid \\citep{2010PASP..122.1341B}.  A special case of nearest neighbor kernel regression is bilinearly interpolated subpixel sensitivity (BLISS) mapping \\citep{2012ApJ...754..136S}.  Additional promising techniques that have appeared in recent years include regression via Gaussian Processes (GP) \\citep{2012MNRAS.419.2683G,2015MNRAS.451..680E}; Independent Component Analysis (ICA) \\citep{2015ApJ...808...56M}; and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) \\citep{2015ApJ...805..132D}.  See \\S2.4 for a detailed review of these techniques. \n\n\\subsection{Spitzer/IRAC Eclipse Depth Repeatability}\nAs multi-epoch monitoring data have accumulated, investigators have begun to quantify the repeatability and reliability of exoplanet differential flux measurements made with {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ and other observatories.  A growing body of evidence is showing that modern IRAC correlated noise removal techniques obtain consistent results from one measurement to the next, and obtain consistent results with each other.  \n\nOne indicator of stability is that the individual measurement uncertainties approximately equal the scatter (standard deviation) in independently-measured transit or eclipse depths. For example, \\citet{2013ApJ...765..127F} analyzed 14 transits of GJ1214 b measured at 4.5\\micron\\ with IRAC using a kernel regression decorrelation technique (KR/Data---see \\S2.4.4), yielding a scatter in transit depths within 50\\% of the average reported uncertainty in the individual depths.  \\citet{2014ApJ...794..134W} also used KR/Data to process data for 12 eclipses of XO-3 b, yielding individual uncertainties that were equal to the scatter in the ensemble.  The XO-3 b dataset features prominently in this paper, as a main component of the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ 2015 Data Challenge (see below).  \n\nOlder data often benefit from reanalysis with modern methods.  Four GJ 436b transits were reprocessed using ICA by \\citet{2015ApJ...802..117M}, who determined that the transit depth did not vary by more than 100 ppm, contrary to earlier estimates computed using polynomial fitting \\citep{2011ApJ...731...16B,2011ApJ...735...27K}.  The ICA technique was also used to establish a repeatable (within 200 ppm) transit depth for HD 189733b \\citep{2014ApJ...786...22M}, after many conflicting prior values led to questions of stellar variability.  BLISS mapping \\citep{2014ApJ...796...66D} and GP \\citep{2015MNRAS.451..680E} were both used to reanalyze 4 eclipses of HD 209458b, including one taken under non-optimal observing conditions (see \\S4.3).  Both teams concluded that the group of measurements was self-consistent  \\citep[scatter 30\\% less than uncertainties for][]{2015MNRAS.451..680E}, and that the earlier estimate of a much deeper occultation, which resulted in claims of a possible temperature inversion layer in the planet's atmosphere \\citep{2008ApJ...673..526K}, was incorrect.  \n\n\\subsection{Goals of this paper}\nBecause of the high relative precision required for eclipse depth and other exoplanet measurements, it is important to characterize the ability of an instrument---together with the chosen method of systematics removal---to return consistent results.  This is especially crucial when comparing data to models \\citep[see][for a discussion of the difficulty of spectral retrieval from data with low S/N]{Burrows:2014jd} or measuring atmospheric variability \\citep[eg., see][who found evidence for eclipse depth changes of $\\sim 140\\,$ppm over 1 year in 55 Cnc e]{2016MNRAS.455.2018D}.  Despite the growing number of analyses of multi-epoch transit and eclipse measurements, all have thus far focused on either a single method of removing correlated noise \\citep{2013ApJ...765..127F,2014ApJ...794..134W,2015ApJ...802..117M,2014ApJ...796...66D,2015MNRAS.451..680E}, or only considered two epochs per target \\citep{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}.  \n\nThis paper revisits the question of the repeatability of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC eclipse depths in the post-cryogenic mission, with an eye towards answering the questions: how stable can we reasonably expect IRAC eclipse depth measurements to be; and how close are they to the truth?  We aim to establish limits on both the IRAC instrument and the best modern techniques for removing correlated noise and measuring eclipse depths, using both real and simulated data. Recently, a Data Challenge consisting of the measurement of ten secondary eclipses of XO-3 b \\citep{2014ApJ...794..134W}, and a complementary analysis of a synthetic version of the XO-3 b data was undertaken.  In \\S2 we describe the Data Challenge.  We introduce the real XO-3 b dataset, give an overview of the {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC simulator and the creation of the simulated dataset, and outline seven techniques used to decorrelate the photometry.  In \\S3 we report on the results of the data challenge, estimating the single eclipse depth repeatability and the reliability or precision of the results when reduced by the different methods. We compare the variability between methods, as well as the accuracy of the techniques when applied to simulated data.  In \\S4 we discuss the implications of our results for post-cryogenic exoplanet measurements with {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}.  We also evaluate a recent proposal to inflate IRAC eclipse depth uncertainties \\citep{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}, and suggest application of our approach to future space observatories.  We conclude in \\S5 by summarizing our key results.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{The IRAC 2015 Data Challenge}\nTo assess the repeatability, reliability, and accuracy of post-cryogenic observations with IRAC, the {\\sl Spitzer} Science Center (SSC) in conjunction with active exoplanet researchers from the astronomical community has performed an analysis of the removal of systematics and measured the repeatability of warm IRAC observations.  The SSC made available to the public both a real dataset as well as synthetic data (where the eclipse depth is an input) on the IRAC Data Challenge 2015 website\\footnote{http://irachpp.spitzer.caltech.edu/page/data-challenge-2015}.  Contributions were solicited, and preliminary results were presented at the IRAC 2nd Workshop on High Precision Photometry, held during the 2015 International Astronomical Union meeting in Honolulu, HI, USA\\footnote{http://irachpp.spitzer.caltech.edu/page/IRAC\\_IAU\\_2015}.  In this section we describe the real and simulated data and the decorrelation techniques used. \n\n\\subsection{Real XO-3b Observations}\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{cccccccrr}\n\\tabletypesize{\\scriptsize}\n\n\\tablecaption{Real {\\sl Spitzer} XO-3b Eclipse AORs and Positions}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablehead{\n\\colhead{Start Time\\tablenotemark{a}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{AOR Number\\tablenotemark{b}} & \\colhead{$\\langle X\\rangle$\\tablenotemark{c}} & \\colhead{$\\sigma_X$\\tablenotemark{d}} & \\colhead{$\\langle Y\\rangle$\\tablenotemark{c}} &\n\\colhead{$\\sigma_Y$\\tablenotemark{d}} & \\colhead{$\\sigma_{XY}$\\tablenotemark{e}} & \\colhead{No.\\tablenotemark{f}} \\\\\n\\colhead{(JD-2455000)} &Pre&Main&\n\\colhead{(px)} & \\colhead{(px)} &\n\\colhead{(px)} & \\colhead{(px)} &\\colhead{($10^{-4}\\,$px$^2$)} & \\colhead{}\n}\n\\startdata\n1242.2402 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46467072]{46467072} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46471424]{46471424} & 15.17 & 0.03 & 15.00 & 0.05 & --8.56\\phantom{000} &  2 \\\\\n1248.6482 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46467840]{46467840} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46471168]{46471168} & 15.10 & 0.04 & 15.14 & 0.06 & 9.53\\phantom{000} &  3 \\\\\n1251.8187 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46470144]{46470144} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46470912]{46470912} & 15.23 & 0.06 & 15.03 & 0.06 & --25.63\\phantom{000} &  4 \\\\\n1255.0166 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46467584]{46467584} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46470656]{46470656} & 15.17 & 0.04 & 15.13 & 0.05 & 4.25\\phantom{000} &  5 \\\\\n1264.5897 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46469376]{46469376} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46470400]{46470400} & 15.19 & 0.03 & 14.99 & 0.06 & --4.31\\phantom{000} &  6 \\\\\n1270.9776 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46466816]{46466816} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46469632]{46469632} & 15.13 & 0.06 & 15.12 & 0.05 & 9.22\\phantom{000} &  7 \\\\\n1405.0165 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46468864]{46468864} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46469120]{46469120} & 15.21 & 0.03 & 14.92 & 0.04 & --3.93\\phantom{000} &  8 \\\\\n1430.5523 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46469888]{46469888} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46468608]{46468608} & 15.15 & 0.03 & 15.01 & 0.05 & --4.45\\phantom{000} &  10 \\\\\n1433.7433 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46467328]{46467328} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46468352]{46468352} & 15.21 & 0.03 & 14.99 & 0.05 & --4.04\\phantom{000} &  11 \\\\\n1436.9273 & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46471680]{46471680} & \\dataset[ADS/Sa.Spitzer#46468096]{46468096} & 15.23 & 0.04 & 14.96 & 0.05 & --2.80\\phantom{000} &  12 \\\\\n\\tableline\n\\multicolumn{3}{r}{Column Means\\tablenotemark{g}} & 15.18 & 0.04 & 15.03 & 0.05 & --3.07\\phantom{000} & \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{r}{All Data\\tablenotemark{h}} & 15.18 & 0.06 & 15.03 & 0.09 & --26.63\\phantom{000} &\n\n\\enddata\n\n\n\n\\tablenotetext{a}{Start time of first exposure of initial AOR.}\n\\tablenotetext{b}{Electronic versions of this table contain links to these datasets in the {\\sl Spitzer} archive.}\n\\tablenotetext{c}{Mean centroid over all measurements in the two AORs.}\n\\tablenotetext{d}{Standard deviation in centroid over all measurements in the two AORs.}\n\\tablenotetext{e}{$(x,y)$ Covariance in centroid over all measurements in the two AORs.}\n\\tablenotetext{f}{Eclipse number as listed in Table 1 of \\citet{2014ApJ...794..134W} (not all eclipses analyzed by \\citeauthor{2014ApJ...794..134W} were part of the Data Challenge).}\n\\tablenotetext{g}{Mean, standard deviation, and $(x,y)$ covariance of centroid averaged along the table column.}\n\\tablenotetext{h}{Mean, standard deviation, and $(x,y)$ covariance of centroid over all AORs.}\n\\label{xo3meas}\n\\end{deluxetable*}\n\nThe XO-3b data used for the Data Challenge consisted of 10 individual secondary eclipse measurements originally analyzed by \\citet{2014ApJ...794..134W}, and summarized in Table 1.  All measurements were made with post-cryogenic {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ in 2012 and 2013, and were taken as part of Program ID (PID) 90032.  The first 6 epochs took place within about 30 days of each other; the last 4 occurred about 1/2 year later and also spanned 30 days.  Each epoch consisted of two Astronomical Observation Requests (AORs): an 11-exposure, 30 minute ``Pre'' AOR to allow short term pointing drift to settle; and a 233-exposure, 8.5 hour ``Main'' AOR that contained the secondary eclipse.  Each exposure produced a FITS format image file, containing a cube of 64 32$\\times$32 pixel images taken 2s apart with the source in the subarray field-of-view on the 4.5\\,$\\mu$m array.  The measurements were taken in staring mode (no repositoning within an AOR), and used PCRS Peak-Up to establish the position of XO-3b at the beginning of each AOR.\\footnote{http://irachpp.spitzer.caltech.edu/page/Obs\\%20Planning} Table \\ref{xo3meas} gives the observation start time, {\\sl Spitzer} AOR numbers, and the eclipse number \\citep[for comparison with][Table 1]{2014ApJ...794..134W}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Synthetic XO-3b Observations}\n\\begin{deluxetable*}{cccccccr}\n\\tabletypesize{\\scriptsize}\n\n\\tablecaption{Synthetic {\\sl Spitzer} XO-3b AORs and Positions}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablehead{\n\\colhead{Start Time\\tablenotemark{a}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{AOR Number\\tablenotemark{b}} & \\colhead{$\\langle X\\rangle$} & \\colhead{$\\sigma_X$} & \\colhead{$\\langle Y\\rangle$} &\n\\colhead{$\\sigma_Y$} & \\colhead{$\\sigma_{XY}$}\\\\\n\\colhead{(JD-2455000)} &Pre&Main&\n\\colhead{(px)} & \\colhead{(px)} &\n\\colhead{(px)} & \\colhead{(px)} &\\colhead{($10^{-4}\\,$px$^2$)} \n}\n\\startdata\n2206.1459 & 20150000 & 20150001 & 15.16 & 0.02 & 15.01 & 0.05 & --5.93\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2209.2927 & 20150002 & 20150003 & 15.12 & 0.02 & 15.08 & 0.03 & --4.57\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2212.5079 & 20150004 & 20150005 & 15.16 & 0.03 & 15.13 & 0.05 & --10.33\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2215.7214 & 20150006 & 20150007 & 15.10 & 0.02 & 15.06 & 0.10 & --16.34\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2218.9047 & 20150008 & 20150009 & 15.20 & 0.03 & 15.17 & 0.07 & --10.95\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2222.0547 & 20150010 & 20150011 & 15.12 & 0.02 & 15.17 & 0.04 & --5.19\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2225.2356 & 20150012 & 20150013 & 15.18 & 0.03 & 15.05 & 0.09 & --20.87\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2228.4898 & 20150014 & 20150015 & 15.17 & 0.02 & 15.09 & 0.10 & --10.61\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2231.6296 & 20150016 & 20150017 & 15.14 & 0.02 & 15.17 & 0.05 & --7.41\\phantom{000} \\\\\n2234.8406 & 20150018 & 20150019 & 15.10 & 0.03 & 15.09 & 0.06 & --6.71\\phantom{000} \\\\\n\\tableline\n\\multicolumn{3}{r}{Column Means} & 15.15 & 0.03 & 15.10 & 0.06 & --9.90\\phantom{000} \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{r}{All Data} & 15.15 & 0.04 & 15.10 & 0.09 & --8.64\\phantom{000} \n\\enddata\n\n\n\n\\tablenotetext{a}{Simulated start time of first exposure of initial AOR.}\n\\tablenotetext{b}{Data may be downloaded from http://irachpp.spitzer.caltech.edu/page/data--challenge--2015}\n\\label{sim_xo3meas}\n\\end{deluxetable*}\n\nObserved variations in eclipse depths are caused by a combination of variations in {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ pointing, IRAC detector state, and possible evolution of the planetary system, as well as the limitations and biases of the technique for reducing correlated noise.  We can analyze the data using different techniques to assess differences in the methods, but it is often difficult with real data to completely separate pointing from instrumental or planetary variations.  This is one reason we have included synthetic data as part of the Data Challenge, for which both the exoplanet and IRAC are given constant properties.  In the simulations, any measured variations in eclipse depth are due solely to (1) random noise and (2) residual correlated noise not removed by decorrelation analysis.  This should give us a better insight into the capabilities of the decorrelation methods than real data alone. \n\nTo produce the simulated XO-3b observations used for the Data Challenge, we used {\\tt IRACSIM}, a package built in the IDL programming language.  The program uses a model of the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC system to create synthetic IRAC point source measurements, outputting FITS image (or image cube) files similar to those produced by the IRAC basic calibrated data (BCD) pipeline. We give an overview of the model in the Appendix.\n\nTable \\ref{sim_xo3meas} gives the simulated observation start times and AOR numbers of the synthetic observations.  The simulations followed closely the design of the real observations, with each observing ``epoch'' containing 2 AORs, a similar number of exposures per AOR, and the same integration parameters.  We set the start times for each synthetic epoch at slightly different phases of different actual XO-3b orbits, as often occurs in real observations.  This allows for different proportions of samples before and after eclipse for each epoch to minimize biases in fitting.\n\nTable \\ref{ptg_params} lists the range of inputs to the pointing model used in simulating the XO-3b data. We chose not to duplicate exactly the pointing fluctuations as observed in the real dataset, but attempted to simulate a range of possible {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ observing conditions (drawn roughly from the distribution of observed cases), and thus a range of possible decorrelation situations.  In practice this resulted in generally larger pointing fluctuations and drifts than found in the real data.\n\nWe used the {\\tt IRACSIM} exoplanet wrapper to model the light curve of XO-3b, obtaining values for the system's stellar, orbital, and transit parameters from the exoplanets.org database (as of 2015 July 2) and simulating the planet's thermal phase variations using the model of \\citet{2011ApJ...726...82C}.  Since the goal was to understand IRAC data, not XO-3b, we set somewhat arbitrary values of the planetary parameters: (1) albedo, $A=0$; (2) radiative timescale, $\\tau_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} rad}=1\\,$day; and (3) net rotational angular velocity of the cloud layer, $\\Omega_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} rot} = 1$ (in units of the orbital angular velocity at periastron).  The resulting phase curve gives a non-flat appearance to the flux outside of eclipse and sets the depth of the eclipse, which we define in terms of the stellar flux.  In this case, the model eclipse depth for XO-3b is 1875\\,ppm, about 16\\% larger than the actual depth published by \\citet{2014ApJ...794..134W}.  The model light curve for the second AOR of the 10th epoch is shown in Figure \\ref{predicted_lightcurve}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\plotone{XO-3_b_sim_ch2_150702_9_0020150019_predicted_lightcurve.pdf}\n\\caption{Light curve for simulated XO-3b observations, AOR number 20150019.

When {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ is commanded to continuously observe an inertially fixed target (``staring'' mode), a source position will undergo ``jitter'' and ``wobble'' with a net amplitude of about 0.08\\,px per hour, while also incurring a slow linear drift of about 0.01\\,px per hour (see \\S A.1 for an analytical model of these fluctuations). These telescope motions have been described in detail by \\citet{Grillmair:2012fq}, and the physical causes of some are known.  For example, the wobble is caused by a battery heater cycling on and off with period of $\\sim 40\\,$min, and the long term drift ($y$ pixel direction only) is caused by the discrepancy between the instantaneous velocity aberration of the spacecraft and the on-board aberration correction that occurs only at the start of an AOR.  A map of the photometric gain of a point source on the central pixel of the 4.5\\micron\\ subarray is displayed in Figure \\ref{xo3b_pos_real}, showing that correlated noise due to pointing fluctuations can be as much as 1--2\\%, a factor of 10 larger than the XO-3 b eclipse depth.\n\nAs part of the Data Challenge, exoplanet experts have used seven different data reduction techniques to remove correlated noise from the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC photometry and assess the eclipse depth repeatability.  Among these are the most commonly used techniques in the current literature to date (BLISS, KR/Data), as well as a group of more recently developed methods [GP, ICA, KR/Pmap, PLD, Segmented Polynomial (K2 pipeline)]. We review below the seven techniques, adding specific notes as to how the methodology was implemented for the XO-3b datasets described in this paper.\n\n\\subsubsection{BiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping}\nBLISS mapping \\citep{2012ApJ...754..136S} uses bilinear interpolation over a photometric dataset, to predict the intra-pixel response at a given ($x,y$) location.  The procedure establishes a subpixel rectangular grid of ``knots'' spanning the dataset.  Each knot is assigned the mean flux value from among all points in the dataset for which that knot point is the nearest.  The intra-pixel gain at a given data point is then computed from the knot fluxes via bilinear interpolation to the point ($x,y$).  \n\nFor the implementation described here, performed by H. Diamond-Lowe and K. Stevenson, photometric measurements were obtained using the POET pipeline described in \\citet{2012ApJ...754..136S}, which produced artifact-corrected BCD images interpolated to a 1/5-pixel grid. Centroid positions were measured by fitting a 2D Gaussian profile with fixed width \\citep[see the Supplemental Information for][]{2010Natur.464.1161S} on the resampled images, and fluxes were measured using aperture photometry.  Intra-pixel effects were removed using BLISS mapping, and various models were attempted to fit the decorrelated light curve, including a flat or possibile linear detector ``ramp'' (time-dependent flux baseline) and flat, linear, quadratic, or sinusoidal phase variations.  The eclipse depth, duration, and time of ingress and egress were fit separately for each epoch, as well as commonly among all visits.  Acceptance of model parameters was decided by minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n{\\rm BIC} = -2\\,\\ln \\hat{L} + k\\,\\ln(n),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\rm BIC}=-2\\,\\ln\\hat{L}+k\\,\\ln(n),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>BIC</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>2</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>L</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>k</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05101.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhich approximates the effective area (in square pixels) of a point source.  We display $\\tilde{\\beta}$ as a function of phase in the third panel of Figures \\ref{xo3b_phase_real} and \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake}.  This parameter is partly geometric:  even if the flux is the same and the numerator of Equation \\ref{noise_pixels} does not change, moving a source from the center to the edge of a pixel will spread the light to more pixels, decreasing the denominator and increasing $\\tilde{\\beta}$.  Thus we see in Figures \\ref{xo3b_phase_real} and \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake} how $\\tilde{\\beta}$ is correlated with the centroids to an extent. But it also can measure the smearing of the IRAC PSF due to high frequency jitter (if the period less than the detector sample time; see \\S{A.3} for a discussion of IRAC sampling), where the light is spread over a larger area but the centroid does not change markedly.  \n\nWe display the mean background in the fourth panel, and the aperture flux in the fifth panel of Figures \\ref{xo3b_phase_real} and \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake}.  We normalized the values in these last two panels to the mean value over all AORs, allowing us to notice relative shifts between AORs.  Fluxes are estimated using the IDL photometry program {\\tt aper.pro}, with a 2.25-pixel radius circular aperture and a 3--7 pixel background annulus. Backgrounds are the mean value per pixel in the annulus, scaled to the area of the aperture. The net aperture flux is thus the integrated intensity per pixel weighted by the fraction of each pixel lying inside the aperture, minus the background value.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dc15_lightcurves_real.eps}\n\\caption{Decorrelated light curves for {\\bf real} XO-3b measurements, 5th epoch ({\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ AOR number 46470400).

We overlay the input model lightcurve as a blue solid line.\n\\label{lightcurves_sim}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nVarious known features of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data can be seen in Figure \\ref{xo3b_phase_real}.  The short term pointing drift, as well as the sawtooth-shaped ``wobble'', can be seen in the $x$ and $y$ centroids (and to a lesser extent in $\\tilde{\\beta}$) (pointing effects are stronger in the $y$ direction).  The aperture fluxes for some epochs show very clearly the correlated noise signature due to these telescope motions. The eclipse can also be seen in the flux between phase --0.35 and --0.31.  \n\nThe background values show a quick ramp in the beginning of each epoch, and settle into a much slower increase with time for the final 8 or so hours.  This may be related to the ``flux ramp'' seen by many who work on 4.5\\micron\\ staring mode IRAC data \\citep[eg.,][]{2012ApJ...754...22K,2013ApJ...766...95L}.  In this case there is no similar ramp in the fluxes, so the background ramp is likely due to a relaxation in detector bias, not responsivity.\n\nThe simulation data (Figure \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake}) show many of the same features, with a few differences.   First, noise on timescales shorter than the wobble period averages quite cleanly to zero in the binned measurements of centroid and noise pixels, as compared to the same plots for the real dataset.  This suggests the presence in real data of a component of jitter that is more correlated with time than the $1/f$ signal currently included.   Second, the magnitudes of short and long term pointing drift and the amplitude of pointing fluctuations are all larger than in the real data, as seen in the ($x,y$) centroids and $\\tilde{\\beta}$.  This is also visible in Fig. \\ref{xo3b_pos_fake} when compared with Fig. \\ref{xo3b_pos_real}.  Third, the simulated backgrounds are much more uniform from one AOR to another because we commanded the same linear increase with time, with constant mean.  Fourth, the larger spread in position has increased the overall noise in the light curve.  This will have consequences for the decorrelation of the measurements and the estimation of eclipse depths.\n\nWe display in Figures \\ref{lightcurves_real} and \\ref{lightcurves_sim} some examples of decorrelated light curves using different techniques, for the 5th epochs of the real and simulated observations.  The curves for the BLISS, GP, and ICA reductions all show noticeably more scatter in the simulated version, which is probably a result of the aforementioned larger spread in target positions. \\\\\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_edepth_real.eps}\n\\caption{Eclipse depths for 10 {\\bf real} visits to XO-3b, as computed via various methods.

the 7 Data Challenge participants estimated eclipse depths and uncertainties from decorrelated light curves, for each set of 10 epochs from the real and simulated datasets.  Figure \\ref{edepth_real} plots the measured depths for the real data and Figure \\ref{edepth_fake} plots the results for the simulated data.  We define the eclipse depth in terms of the stellar flux: \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 46369, "prevtext": "  \nwhere $\\hat{L}\\equiv p(x|\\hat{\\theta},M)$ is the maximized value of the likelihood function of the data $x$ given the maximizing parameters $\\hat{\\theta}$ and the model $M$, $k$ is the number of free parameters, and $n$ is the number of data points in $x$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Gaussian process regression (GP)}\nGaussian process regression is a procedure for using the correlation properties of a dataset to predict the value at an arbitrary point.  It is alternately known as Kriging and Wiener-Kolmogorov prediction, and was first described in the astrophysical literature by \\citet{1992ApJ...398..169R} as a means of interpolating irregularly spaced data.  The technique was used to model instrumental systematics in exoplanet observations by \\citet{2012MNRAS.419.2683G} and first applied to {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC data by \\citet{2015MNRAS.451..680E}.   \n\nFor the Data Challenge, the GP analysis by T. Evans started with a maximum likelihood fit to the eclipse depth, mid-eclipse time, and the variance in the white noise, plus a set of parameters for kernel functions describing how the {\\it covariance} between two photometric measurements varies with their distance in pixel ($x,y$) and time.  The covariance kernel functions are used analagously to the kernel regression function described below, except the standard kernel regression is applied directly to the photometry.  Uncertainties for the eclipse parameters were obtained using MCMC with Metropolis-Hastings sampling in the region of maximum likelihood.  In the final MCMC step the covariance kernel parameters and white noise variance were held fixed to allow rapid evaluation of the likelihood.  One drawback to the GP method is the evaluation of the $N\\times N$ empirical covariance matrix among $N$ data points is often prohibitive with large datasets.  To avoid this difficulty, fluxes and centroids were binned as a function of time in groups of $\\sim 30\\,$s, resulting in $N\\sim 1000$ data points in each eclipse light curve \\citep[see][for more details]{2015MNRAS.451..680E}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Independent component analysis (ICA)}\nIndependent component analysis is a non-parametric technique for separating blended signals, with little specific {\\it a priori} knowledge of their structure.  This is the classic ``cocktail party problem'' of signal processing, which attempts to mimic the human brain's innate capacity for hearing multiple speakers in a crowded room \\citep{Hyvarinen:2000ho}.  In contrast to {\\it principle} component analysis, ICA does not assume that the statistically independent signals follow Gaussian distributions, and in fact attempts to maximize the {\\it non}-Gaussianity after separation.  The methods of ICA were first developed for exoplanet light curve analysis by \\citet{2012ApJ...747...12W} and used on {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data by \\citet{2014ApJ...786...22M}.  \n\n\nThe ICA data reduction of the XO-3 b real and simulated eclipse datasets, by G. Morello, used a new ``wavelet-pixel'' variant on the approach introduced in \\citet{2014ApJ...786...22M} and \\citet{2015ApJ...808...56M} for transits.  In this variant, the source separation operates on wavelet-transformed individual pixel light curves, after which the resulting components are transformed back to the time domain.  The wavelet transform was useful for enhancing the signal to noise ratio in the lower frequency instrument systematics components prior to ICA.   By operating on the individual pixel light curves, ICA circumvents a built-in degeneracy that occurs for most decorrelation techniques, which decorrelate aperture fluxes using ($x,y$) centroids.\\footnote{Since flux and centroid are both weighted sums of pixel intensities (center-of-light centroids are linear sums, whereas Gaussian fits are effectively nonlinear sums), flux and centroid are always correlated {\\it by definition}.  This intrinsic correlation effectively adds ``noise'' to the flux vs. centroid signal. }  \n\nThe sum of an eclipse light curve model (including a linear phase variation) and scaled versions of the non-eclipse independent components was then fit to the raw light curve.  An Adaptive Metropolis MCMC algorithm with delayed rejection produced chains of 300,000 values to serve as samples of the posterior distributions of the fit parameters.  These distributions yielded estimates of the parameters and their uncertainties.  The final error bars were then increased to include the ICA component separation error.  A full description of the implementation of ICA on the XO-3b real dataset is given by \\citet{Morello:2016wq}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Kernel regression (KR/Data, KR/PMap)}\nKernel regression is the earliest nonparametric technique used to measure and correct the intra-pixel sensitivity of the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC InSb detectors.  In mathematics and engineering, the general use of kernel-based methods was originally applied to the estimation of density functions (eg., histograms).  Eventually they were proposed as potential tools for regression (i.e., the fitting or prediction of function values) \\citep{Nadaraya:2006de,Watson:1964kb}.  The kernel regression estimator is a weighted average of the measured data, with a kernel function specifying how the weight decreases with distance from the target point {\\bf X} to be estimated.  Limiting the contributing data points to the $k$ nearest neighbors to the target is an additional expedient for faster computation \\citep{Stone:1977ey}.  The first application of kernel regression to estimate the intra-pixel response in {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ photometry was done by \\citet{2010PASP..122.1341B}.  The use of the Noise Pixel parameter, $\\tilde{\\beta}$, as a third component of the distance metric of the weighting kernel (in addition to $x$ and $y$ pixel centroid) was first described by \\citet{2013ApJ...766...95L}.\n\nThe most commonly used version of kernel regression, KR/Data, uses the data to be corrected as its own ``training set,'' i.e., the data (except the single datum being corrected) are used in the kernel average to obtain the correction.  This requires that the observations contain sufficient redundancy in positioning to allow estimation of its own correlated noise via the inverse distance-weighted average, even in the presence of temporal variations in the astrophysical source.  The published reduction of the real XO-3b eclipse dataset, described in \\citet{2014ApJ...794..134W}, used KR/Data.  A complementary analysis of the synthetic XO-3b dataset was performed by I. Wong for the Data Challenge.  For both analyses only $x$ and $y$ centroid (as measured using the center of light technique; see \\S3.1) were used in the kernel's distance metric, but $\\tilde{\\beta}$ was employed for most eclipses as a scale factor in determining the optimal aperture size for the photometry. \\citeauthor{2014ApJ...794..134W} chose $k=50$ nearest neighbors for the weighted sums.  They fit the data in two ways: each epoch separately, and all epochs combined.  The separate fits were only concerned with the eclipse depth, time of mid-eclipse, and linear slope of phase curve, whereas the global fits also included the planet-to-star radius ratio, the orbital inclination, and the semi-major axis to stellar radius.  Both fits were performed using a Levenberg--Marquardt (L-M) nonlinear least squares algorithm. They then used both a prayer-bead method and a MCMC routine to estimate the distributions of each parameter and their uncertainties, and reported the largest uncertainty of the two methods. \n\nA variation on the kernel regression technique, KR/Pmap, uses the photometry of a separate calibration star as the training set for the regression (Krick et al., submitted).  For each science data point to be corrected, the $k$ nearest neighbors in the pixel mapping (pmap) dataset are found, based on the Euclidean distance in $x$ and $y$ centroid and $\\tilde{\\beta}$.  Similarly to the KR/Data implementation, $k=50$ was chosen.  The kernel-weighted pmap data are then summed and normalized by the calibration star flux averaged over the pixel.  The potential benefit of KR/Pmap over KR/Data is that the correction is not built from the science measurements themselves, and therefore time-varying astrophysical signal does not contribute to the kernel averages.  On the other hand, detector variability (eg., latent charge) may differ between the calibration star measurements and those of the data to be corrected, and bias the regression.\n\nThe KR/Pmap analysis of the Data Challenge measuremements was performed by J. Krick.  Different calibration datasets were used to correct the real and synthetic XO-3b measurements.  For the real data, the {\\sl Spitzer} Science Center (SSC) has accumulated approximately 400,000 pixel mapping measurements of BD+67 1044, a star that is not known to vary, which are positioned near the ``sweet spot'' (peak of response) of the Ch 2 (4.5\\micron) subarray pixel (15,15). Since the IRAC simulator uses an idealized PRF that cannot replicate the detailed structure of the actual pixel response, the real BD +67 1044 dataset is not appropriate for reduction of simulated data.  Instead, a synthetic pixel mapping set was created.  The measurements were designed to mimic the actual pmap measurements of BD +67 1044, with similar source flux, integration parameters, mapping centers, and number of data points.  The pointing model parameters were taken from the same ranges as for the XO-3b simulations (Table \\ref{ptg_params}), to approximate realistic motions during integration and sampling. \n\nEclipse parameters were derived from the KR/Pmap-decorrelated data by fitting a \\citet{2002ApJ...580L.171M} light curve shape with no phase trend using an L-M nonlinear least squares algorithm.  The uncertainties returned were solely the formal uncertainties in the L-M fit, and should be considered underestimates.  As a check on the results, Transit Analysis Package (TAP) \\citep{2012AdAst2012E..30G} was also used to fit the eclipses, after setting the limb darkening coefficients to zero.  While the uncertainties tended to be more realistic under TAP's MCMC analysis, the eclipse depths themselves were systematically low compared to both the L-M fit and the mean of the other techniques.  We therefore decided to use the L-M results and assess the uncertainties using the ``overdispersion factor'' described in \\S3.2.\n\n\\subsubsection{Pixel level decorrelation (PLD)}\nThe pixel level decorrelation technique \\citep{2015ApJ...805..132D} is a parametric method that expresses the correlated noise in terms of a Taylor expansion sum of individual pixel values, instead of a function of centroid position.  The Taylor expansion partial derivatives become linear coefficients multiplying the (normalized) pixel values, a function that can be fit and removed.  Like with ICA, using the individual pixel values avoids the flux/centroid degeneracy inherent in most decorrelation methods.  \n\nThe PLD reduction of the Data Challenge observations, by D. Deming, used 2D Gaussian centroiding \\citep{2010ApJ...721.1861A} only to determine where to place the circular aperture, but not as a decorrelation variable.  An eclipse function was fit to the photometry simultaneously with the pixel coefficients and a quadratic phase curve \\citep[see][Equation 4]{2015ApJ...805..132D}.  Due to time limitations, a full MCMC analysis of uncertainties was not possible, so error bars were estimated using the slope of the standard deviation vs. bin size relationship for the residuals \\citep[as described in][]{2015ApJ...805..132D} to extrapolate to bins of width the eclipse duration.  \n\n\\subsubsection{Segmented Polynomial, K2 Pipeline [SP(K2)]}\nThe segmented polynomial algorithm was originally developed for use with K2 data \\citep{Buzasi:2015vo}, where detrending is normally required due to the presence of spacecraft pointing resets, and other less significant sources of correlated noise. The approach is reminiscent of polynomial surface fitting as used on {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data, but with some differences.  Detrending is carried out in two stages.  In the first stage, a third-order polynomial is fit to the flux vs.\\,($x,y$) centroid for the entire time series and removed.  This process is repeated, with successive third order polynomial fits being applied to each set of residuals, until there is $< 1\\%$ further reduction in the high-frequency noise standard deviation. In the second stage, the resulting time series is divided into segments, each of which is iteratively decorrelated using polynomial fitting. This segmented detrending is repeated for 10 different segment lengths between 0.04 and 0.125 of the total time series length, and the final time series is the result of applying a median filter to the 10 results.\n\nSP(K2) detrending was applied to the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ Data Challenge measurements by D. Buzasi.  Due to time limitations a simple box function was used to fit the eclipse profile, and the uncertainties reported are formal fit errors.  \n\nNo attempt was made to tune SP(K2) for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data. Future analysis might benefit from adjustment of the segmentation and fitting strategy.  For K2, the segmentation is partially necessary to accommodate unpredictable discontinuous jumps in source position when the pointing is reset, but this is not as much of an issue for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ staring mode observations (except for observations longer than 12 hours, for which there will be predictable pointing resets).  Furthermore, IRAC's intra-pixel gain variations are much larger than those of K2---the gain of IRAC varies by $\\sim 8\\%$ in Ch 1 (3.6\\micron) and $\\sim 4\\%$ in Ch 2 (4.5\\micron) across a pixel, whereas the K2 effect is only about 2\\%.  {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data might be more amenable to spatial, rather than temporal, segmentation of the data in stage 2.  \n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{XO-3b Centroids and Photometry}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\plotone{x03b_dc15_positions.eps}\n\\caption{Centroid positions of XO-3 on the IRAC 4.5\\,$\\mu$m subarray, from the {\\bf real} dataset.

The background grayscale and contours shows the intra-pixel photometric gain map (``Pmap''), as measured using kernel regression on a simulated calibration star.\\label{xo3b_pos_fake}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n \nWe begin with an overview of the data characteristics.  Figure \\ref{xo3b_pos_real} plots all centroid positions for the individual measurements on the subarray center pixel for the real data, and Figure \\ref{xo3b_pos_fake} does the same for the simulated data.  Because of the dependence of correlated noise on pointing fluctuations, most noise-removal techniques use source centroid as a primary decorrelation variable.  Most techniques described in \\S2.4 use either 2D Gaussian fitting  or the flux-weighted ``center of light'' method to determine a point source center on the undersampled {\\sl Spitzer} arrays. In this paper, if not stated otherwise, we only report center of light centroids:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx_c & = & \\frac{\\sum_i i\\,(f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}{\\sum_i (f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}; \\label{x_centroid}\\\\\ny_c & = & \\frac{\\sum_j j\\,(f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}{\\sum_j (f_{ij}-f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG})}\\label{y_centroid}. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, ($i,j$) is the pixel number, $f_{ij}$ is the image value at that pixel, and $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} BG}$ is the background flux in surrounding pixels.  The sums are over a ($7\\times 7$)-pixel region surrounding the expected position of the source.   This centroiding method is sufficiently precise for decorrelation, resulting in positional distortions of at most 0.05 pixels \\citep{2014SPIE.9143E..1MI}. \\citep[There is some disagreement as to the adequacy of center-of-light centroiding; see for example][]{2014PASP..126.1092L}.\n\nColumns 4--8 of Tables \\ref{xo3meas} (real) and \\ref{sim_xo3meas} (simulated) summarize the centroid ``clouds'' for each epoch, giving the means and standard deviations in $x$ and $y$ position, as well as the $xy$ covariances in centroid.  As the real data were all pointed using PCRS peak-up, the mean positions are all within 0.4 pixel of one another, and cluster near the peak of the intra-pixel gain.  Negative covariances for most of the real AORs indicate that the clouds are aligned such that $y$ decreases when $x$ increases, which is a common direction for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC short-term drift.  The bottom 2 rows of Tables \\ref{xo3meas} and \\ref{sim_xo3meas} list the column means and the statistics for all data taken together.  For the real data, the full dataset has a much higher negative covariance than the individual clouds, suggesting that separate pointings fall preferentially along a $\\sim -45\\arcdeg$ axis.  The simulated data feature a much stronger initial drift, as well as a more pronounced $y$ component to the jitter, wobble, and drift than the real data.  Some individual $xy$ covariances in the simulated data are much higher than both the mean and the aggregate covariance for the group, due to this exaggerated elongation.  This ``stretching'' of the positions along $y$ reduces the positional redundancy and, as we will see, challenges the ability of most reduction methods to decorrelate the data.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\n\n\\plotone{x03b_dc15_raw_lightcurves.eps}\n\\caption{{\\bf Real} XO-3b photometric and other measurements as a function of orbital phase (fraction of orbit since transit).

We display $\\tilde{\\beta}$ as a function of phase in the third panel of Figures \\ref{xo3b_phase_real} and \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake}.  This parameter is partly geometric:  even if the flux is the same and the numerator of Equation \\ref{noise_pixels} does not change, moving a source from the center to the edge of a pixel will spread the light to more pixels, decreasing the denominator and increasing $\\tilde{\\beta}$.  Thus we see in Figures \\ref{xo3b_phase_real} and \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake} how $\\tilde{\\beta}$ is correlated with the centroids to an extent. But it also can measure the smearing of the IRAC PSF due to high frequency jitter (if the period less than the detector sample time; see \\S{A.3} for a discussion of IRAC sampling), where the light is spread over a larger area but the centroid does not change markedly.  \n\nWe display the mean background in the fourth panel, and the aperture flux in the fifth panel of Figures \\ref{xo3b_phase_real} and \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake}.  We normalized the values in these last two panels to the mean value over all AORs, allowing us to notice relative shifts between AORs.  Fluxes are estimated using the IDL photometry program {\\tt aper.pro}, with a 2.25-pixel radius circular aperture and a 3--7 pixel background annulus. Backgrounds are the mean value per pixel in the annulus, scaled to the area of the aperture. The net aperture flux is thus the integrated intensity per pixel weighted by the fraction of each pixel lying inside the aperture, minus the background value.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dc15_lightcurves_real.eps}\n\\caption{Decorrelated light curves for {\\bf real} XO-3b measurements, 5th epoch ({\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ AOR number 46470400).

Fluxes have been binned $16\\times$, except for ICA, which was binned $256\\times$.  We overlay the input model lightcurve as a blue solid line.\n\\label{lightcurves_sim}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nVarious known features of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ data can be seen in Figure \\ref{xo3b_phase_real}.  The short term pointing drift, as well as the sawtooth-shaped ``wobble'', can be seen in the $x$ and $y$ centroids (and to a lesser extent in $\\tilde{\\beta}$) (pointing effects are stronger in the $y$ direction).  The aperture fluxes for some epochs show very clearly the correlated noise signature due to these telescope motions. The eclipse can also be seen in the flux between phase --0.35 and --0.31.  \n\nThe background values show a quick ramp in the beginning of each epoch, and settle into a much slower increase with time for the final 8 or so hours.  This may be related to the ``flux ramp'' seen by many who work on 4.5\\micron\\ staring mode IRAC data \\citep[eg.,][]{2012ApJ...754...22K,2013ApJ...766...95L}.  In this case there is no similar ramp in the fluxes, so the background ramp is likely due to a relaxation in detector bias, not responsivity.\n\nThe simulation data (Figure \\ref{xo3b_phase_fake}) show many of the same features, with a few differences.   First, noise on timescales shorter than the wobble period averages quite cleanly to zero in the binned measurements of centroid and noise pixels, as compared to the same plots for the real dataset.  This suggests the presence in real data of a component of jitter that is more correlated with time than the $1/f$ signal currently included.   Second, the magnitudes of short and long term pointing drift and the amplitude of pointing fluctuations are all larger than in the real data, as seen in the ($x,y$) centroids and $\\tilde{\\beta}$.  This is also visible in Fig. \\ref{xo3b_pos_fake} when compared with Fig. \\ref{xo3b_pos_real}.  Third, the simulated backgrounds are much more uniform from one AOR to another because we commanded the same linear increase with time, with constant mean.  Fourth, the larger spread in position has increased the overall noise in the light curve.  This will have consequences for the decorrelation of the measurements and the estimation of eclipse depths.\n\nWe display in Figures \\ref{lightcurves_real} and \\ref{lightcurves_sim} some examples of decorrelated light curves using different techniques, for the 5th epochs of the real and simulated observations.  The curves for the BLISS, GP, and ICA reductions all show noticeably more scatter in the simulated version, which is probably a result of the aforementioned larger spread in target positions. \\\\\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_edepth_real.eps}\n\\caption{Eclipse depths for 10 {\\bf real} visits to XO-3b, as computed via various methods.

We review and adapt these terms below.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_edepth_sim_v_r.eps}\n\\caption{Accuracy vs. reliability, as defined in the text, for the simulated eclipse depth measurements.  The dashed line displays the fit $a = 1.02\\,r$.\n\\label{edepth_sim_v_r}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Repeatability}\nWe define the repeatability, $R$, to be the value below which we can expect the difference between two eclipse depth measurements to lie 68\\% of the time, for a given data reduction method.  For our purposes, $R$ equals the standard deviation (SD) of the differences in separate measurements made with the same method, $R = {\\rm SD}(\\Delta_{ij})$.  Repeatability has the same units as the measurements themselves (eg., ppm).  Note that the repeatability is not the standard deviation in the measurements, which indicates the spread in depths around the mean value, but of their differences.  \n\nOne way to assess repeatability visually is with ``mean/difference'' plots \\citep{Altman:1983bn}, which we show in Figures \\ref{diff_real_visits} (real) and \\ref{diff_fake_visits} (simulated).  The plots display, for all pairs of measured eclipses (each pair is counted only once), the difference in depth ($\\Delta_{ij}$) as a function of the pair average eclipse depth.  Mean/difference plots often show more clearly the limits of variability of the difference between sets than, for example, correlation plots where the variables are plotted against each other. They also allow us to ascertain (via the presence or absence of a trend) whether the difference is correlated with the magnitude, which is not possible with correlation plots.  We compute $R$ from the standard deviation of each group of paired differences, labeled ``SD'' on the bottom left of the plots.\n\nThe values of $R$ for each technique are listed in column 8 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim}.  The real XO-3 b results show a repeatability of better than 200\\,ppm in all cases, with an average value of ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{R}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu} = 139\\,$ppm.  The simulations are less repeatable, with ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{R}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu} = 243\\,$ppm.  This is probably due to the presence of more noise in the eclipse depth measurements for the simulations, as expected from the greater pointing scatter (\\S3.1).  \n\n\nStrictly speaking, in earthbound experiments repeatability is usually assessed on consecutive measurements under {\\it identical} conditions.\\footnote{The measurement of differences under changing conditions is often called {\\it reproducibility}.}    This is not possible for eclipses, since they cannot be repeated at will.  In the time between eclipses, the experimental situation will likely change: a new pointing center and different pointing jitter can change the correlated noise properties; exposure of the detector arrays to other sources of photons may produce latent charge on the pixels of interest, or existing latent charge may decay; the planetary phase curve and eclipse timing and depth may not be the same from one orbit to the next due to stellar variability, perturbations of the planet's orbit, or atmospheric evolution.  But for simplicity, we will continue to refer to the spread in eclipse depth differences as repeatability.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_edepth_sim_v_r_bias.eps}\n\\caption{The accuracy/reliability ratio as a function of mean bias for the simulated eclipse depth measurements.  The dashed line displays the fit $a/r = 1.1-0.0013\\,|{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{B}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}|$.\n\\label{edepth_sim_v_r_bias}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Reliability}\nWe define the {\\it reliability}, $r$, to be the ratio between the intrinsic variability of a set of measurements to their observed variability, for a given method. In the context of eclipse depth measurements the intrinsic variability is the standard deviation in the depth due only to photon noise, $\\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}$ (Equation \\ref{photon_noise}), and the observed variability is the measured standard deviation in the depth, ${\\rm SD}$.  The measured variance contains both the photon noise and the variance due to ``measurement error,'' caused by residual correlated noise.  The value of $r \\equiv \\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}/({\\rm SD})$ is unitless and can range from 0 (all scatter due to measurement error) to 1 (no measurement error).  Reliability is essentially a normalized measure of precision, and is closely related to repeatability (see below).  \n\nWe list the computed values of $r$ for each method in column 9 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim}.  For the real data, the reliability is quite high in most cases, with an average of ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{r}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}=0.78$, suggesting that the bulk of the scatter is due to intrinsic photon noise.  The kernel regression (KR/Data and KR/Pmap) and ICA techniques appear to have very little correlated noise (standard deviations are consistent with photon noise).  For the simulated data, however, the values are lower, with an average reliability of ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{r}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}=0.45$.  \n\nFigures \\ref{real_rep_rel} and \\ref{fake_rep_rel} are scatterplots of repeatability vs. reliability for the real and simulated eclipse depths, respectively. The values appear inversely correlated, which is not surprising.  If two values are drawn from the same distribution, the variance in the difference between the values should be twice the variance of the original distribution, $[{\\rm SD}(\\Delta_{ij})]^2 = 2({\\rm SD})^2$.  Thus by the definition of $r$, we expect $R = \\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}r^{-1}$.  We overlay this theoretical curve, as well as linear fits to $R$ as a function of $r^{-1}$ on Figures \\ref{real_rep_rel} and \\ref{fake_rep_rel}. The differences in the two curves for each plot are very slight, indicating statistical self-consistency between $[{\\rm SD}(\\Delta_{ij})]$ and SD.\n\nFigure \\ref{rel_real_fake} plots the reliability for simulated data as a function of that for real data, for the 7 decorrelation methods, with lines of different slope overlaid. There seems to be no relationship between the reliability measures for real and simulated eclipses, except that the simulated values are nearly all lower than their real counterparts.   Only BLISS has a similar reliability for both real and simulated data ($r=0.59$ and 0.63, respectively).   The kernel regression techniques both show the largest decrease, with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sim} \\approx 0.4\\,r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}$. We conclude that BLISS is most robust to increases in positional dispersion, the main source of additional correlated noise between the simulated and real datasets.  The (gaussian) kernel regression methods seem to be least robust to such changes.\\\\\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Accuracy}\nThe {\\it accuracy} of a technique is a quantitative estimate of how well the technique measures a given characteristic of a system.  Earlier definitions of accuracy were synonymous with what is now called {\\it trueness}, the proximity of the {\\it mean} of a set of measurements to the true value.  Currently, accuracy encompasses both random and systematic error, and so is limited by precision\\footnote{ISO 5725-1: 1994, ``Accuracy (trueness and precision) of measurement methods and results.''}.  That is, even if the mean of a set of measurements is extremely close to the truth (bias is low and trueness is high), if the reliability is low (the scatter in results is much larger than the intrinsic variation), the result is considered to have low accuracy.  \n\nAssume an exoplanet system is observed $N$ times, and a given technique $j$ yields a set of measurements of the eclipse depth, $\\{D_{ij}\\}$ ($i=1,...,N$), with average value, ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{D_j}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}$.  Let the true depth be $D_t$.  We can think of a measurement of eclipse depth as being the sum of the true value, any bias in that measurement (systematic error), $B_{ij}$, and two random noise terms:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 65540, "prevtext": " \nand similarly for the out-of-eclipse flux.

We review and adapt these terms below.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_edepth_sim_v_r.eps}\n\\caption{Accuracy vs. reliability, as defined in the text, for the simulated eclipse depth measurements.  The dashed line displays the fit $a = 1.02\\,r$.\n\\label{edepth_sim_v_r}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Repeatability}\nWe define the repeatability, $R$, to be the value below which we can expect the difference between two eclipse depth measurements to lie 68\\% of the time, for a given data reduction method.  For our purposes, $R$ equals the standard deviation (SD) of the differences in separate measurements made with the same method, $R = {\\rm SD}(\\Delta_{ij})$.  Repeatability has the same units as the measurements themselves (eg., ppm).  Note that the repeatability is not the standard deviation in the measurements, which indicates the spread in depths around the mean value, but of their differences.  \n\nOne way to assess repeatability visually is with ``mean/difference'' plots \\citep{Altman:1983bn}, which we show in Figures \\ref{diff_real_visits} (real) and \\ref{diff_fake_visits} (simulated).  The plots display, for all pairs of measured eclipses (each pair is counted only once), the difference in depth ($\\Delta_{ij}$) as a function of the pair average eclipse depth.  Mean/difference plots often show more clearly the limits of variability of the difference between sets than, for example, correlation plots where the variables are plotted against each other. They also allow us to ascertain (via the presence or absence of a trend) whether the difference is correlated with the magnitude, which is not possible with correlation plots.  We compute $R$ from the standard deviation of each group of paired differences, labeled ``SD'' on the bottom left of the plots.\n\nThe values of $R$ for each technique are listed in column 8 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim}.  The real XO-3 b results show a repeatability of better than 200\\,ppm in all cases, with an average value of ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{R}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu} = 139\\,$ppm.  The simulations are less repeatable, with ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{R}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu} = 243\\,$ppm.  This is probably due to the presence of more noise in the eclipse depth measurements for the simulations, as expected from the greater pointing scatter (\\S3.1).  \n\n\nStrictly speaking, in earthbound experiments repeatability is usually assessed on consecutive measurements under {\\it identical} conditions.\\footnote{The measurement of differences under changing conditions is often called {\\it reproducibility}.}    This is not possible for eclipses, since they cannot be repeated at will.  In the time between eclipses, the experimental situation will likely change: a new pointing center and different pointing jitter can change the correlated noise properties; exposure of the detector arrays to other sources of photons may produce latent charge on the pixels of interest, or existing latent charge may decay; the planetary phase curve and eclipse timing and depth may not be the same from one orbit to the next due to stellar variability, perturbations of the planet's orbit, or atmospheric evolution.  But for simplicity, we will continue to refer to the spread in eclipse depth differences as repeatability.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_edepth_sim_v_r_bias.eps}\n\\caption{The accuracy/reliability ratio as a function of mean bias for the simulated eclipse depth measurements.  The dashed line displays the fit $a/r = 1.1-0.0013\\,|{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{B}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}|$.\n\\label{edepth_sim_v_r_bias}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsubsection{Reliability}\nWe define the {\\it reliability}, $r$, to be the ratio between the intrinsic variability of a set of measurements to their observed variability, for a given method. In the context of eclipse depth measurements the intrinsic variability is the standard deviation in the depth due only to photon noise, $\\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}$ (Equation \\ref{photon_noise}), and the observed variability is the measured standard deviation in the depth, ${\\rm SD}$.  The measured variance contains both the photon noise and the variance due to ``measurement error,'' caused by residual correlated noise.  The value of $r \\equiv \\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}/({\\rm SD})$ is unitless and can range from 0 (all scatter due to measurement error) to 1 (no measurement error).  Reliability is essentially a normalized measure of precision, and is closely related to repeatability (see below).  \n\nWe list the computed values of $r$ for each method in column 9 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim}.  For the real data, the reliability is quite high in most cases, with an average of ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{r}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}=0.78$, suggesting that the bulk of the scatter is due to intrinsic photon noise.  The kernel regression (KR/Data and KR/Pmap) and ICA techniques appear to have very little correlated noise (standard deviations are consistent with photon noise).  For the simulated data, however, the values are lower, with an average reliability of ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{r}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}=0.45$.  \n\nFigures \\ref{real_rep_rel} and \\ref{fake_rep_rel} are scatterplots of repeatability vs. reliability for the real and simulated eclipse depths, respectively. The values appear inversely correlated, which is not surprising.  If two values are drawn from the same distribution, the variance in the difference between the values should be twice the variance of the original distribution, $[{\\rm SD}(\\Delta_{ij})]^2 = 2({\\rm SD})^2$.  Thus by the definition of $r$, we expect $R = \\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}r^{-1}$.  We overlay this theoretical curve, as well as linear fits to $R$ as a function of $r^{-1}$ on Figures \\ref{real_rep_rel} and \\ref{fake_rep_rel}. The differences in the two curves for each plot are very slight, indicating statistical self-consistency between $[{\\rm SD}(\\Delta_{ij})]$ and SD.\n\nFigure \\ref{rel_real_fake} plots the reliability for simulated data as a function of that for real data, for the 7 decorrelation methods, with lines of different slope overlaid. There seems to be no relationship between the reliability measures for real and simulated eclipses, except that the simulated values are nearly all lower than their real counterparts.   Only BLISS has a similar reliability for both real and simulated data ($r=0.59$ and 0.63, respectively).   The kernel regression techniques both show the largest decrease, with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sim} \\approx 0.4\\,r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}$. We conclude that BLISS is most robust to increases in positional dispersion, the main source of additional correlated noise between the simulated and real datasets.  The (gaussian) kernel regression methods seem to be least robust to such changes.\\\\\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Accuracy}\nThe {\\it accuracy} of a technique is a quantitative estimate of how well the technique measures a given characteristic of a system.

The bottom right displays the t-test $p$ value, giving the probability that the $t$ parameter is larger than the measured value if the null hypothesis is true (see text).  If $p<5\\%$, the null hypothesis is rejected, which we take to mean that the two techniques are not measuring the same mean eclipse depth.\n\\label{diff_real_methods}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_diff_fake_methods.eps}\n\\caption{Altman-Bland mean/difference plots, comparing decorrelation techniques to each other for {\\bf simulated} data.  See caption to Figure \\ref{diff_real_methods} for more details.\n\\label{diff_fake_methods}}\n\\end{figure*}\nThe repeatability, reliability, and accuracy are all measures applied to the results of a single decorrelation method.  We can also conduct a more direct comparison of methods.  First, we use the mean/difference plotting method of  \\citet{Altman:1983bn} to make a visual comparison. Figures \\ref{diff_real_methods} (real) and \\ref{diff_fake_methods} display these plots for each pair of methods.  Dashed lines show the mean of the differences, ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{\\Delta}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}$, which estimate the relative bias between techniques; and $\\pm {\\rm SD}(\\Delta)$, which bounds the limits of variability.  Column 10 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim} list the method that gives the closest match to each of the methods of Column 1.  This was chosen as the method giving the smallest range of eclipse values, min($|{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{\\Delta}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}| + {\\rm SD(\\Delta)}$).\n\nAnother way of comparing two approaches is to use the Student's t-test to assess whether the results are drawn from a distribution with the same mean.  The test posits the null hypothesis that both sets of data have the same mean and attempts to reject it.  We use the unpaired version of the test to compute the $t$ statistic (the difference in average values divided by the combined variance) and compare with the t-distribution for the number of degrees of freedom.  The bottom right corner of each panel of Figures \\ref{diff_real_methods} and \\ref{diff_fake_methods} displays the probability that $t$ is larger than the computed value if the null hypotheses were true.  The null hypothesis is rejected if $p<5\\%$, i.e., the measured statistic is in the tail of the distribution.  In all the comparisons for simulated data and most comparisons for real data, the hypothesis is not rejected.  However, for real data, both KR/Pmap and SP(K2) are likely not to have the same mean as ICA, KR/Data, or PLD.\n\nWe can also do a global comparison of methods using analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-test, which posits the null hypothesis that {\\it all} sets of eclipse depths have the same mean.  This analysis assumes that the group of eclipse depths for each method follows a normal distribution, and that each group has approximately the same variance (usually taken to be within a factor of two of each other, which our measurements satisfy).  Similarly to the t-test, it computes a statistic and compares it with the expected distribution under the null hypothesis.  In this case the statistic is $F$, the ratio of the average variability among groups (the dispersion of group means) to the average variability within groups (average group variance), appropriately weighted by the number of degrees of freedom. (The smaller $F$ is, the more likely it is that the groups share the same mean.) The comparison distribution is the F-distribution (also known as the Fisher-Snedecor distribution), which gives the probability of measuring $F$ for the degrees of freedom, given the null hypothesis.     For the real data $F=2.8$, for which only $p=1.6\\%$ of the F-distribution has larger values, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that not all methods have the same mean.  If we remove KR/Pmap and SP(K2) from the calculation because they were the only methods that had failed t-tests, $F=0.9$.  In this case 45\\% of the distribution has larger values, and we don't reject the null hypothesis.  We conclude therefore that KR/Pmap and SP(K2) eclipse depths are biased relative to the other techniques.  For the simulated data $F=0.8$ (all techniques), for which 57\\% of the distribution has larger values, so we don't reject the hypothesis of equal means.\n\nWe emphasize that null hypothesis significance tests like t and F tests are limited in scope and predictive power.  In particular, they only allow us to {\\it reject} the hypotheses of equal means, but not to accept them.  Their probability distributions give the probability, assuming the means are equal, that the corresponding statistic has the measured value, {\\it not} the probability that the means are or are not equal given the measured statistic. Nevertheless, they still have value, at least as a first approach to an inter-method comparison.  Bayesian estimation with Monte-Carlo simulations would provide a more robust and comprehensive framework from which to analyze differences and similarities between results \\citep[eg.,][]{Killeen:2005hv,Kruschke:2013jy}, but is beyond the scope of this work.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\subsection{Repeatability and accuracy of IRAC eclipse depth measurements\\footnote{This section leaves out the SP(K2) technique, which was not developed for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}.}}\nWe have analyzed 10 real and 10 simulated eclipses of hot Jupiter XO-3 b using 7 correlated noise removal methods.  The simulations were in some ways an attempt to replicate the real data, but were given larger pointing fluctuations and drifts, increasing correlated noise and decreasing the positional redundancy that many noise removal techniques rely on.  We have found the following.\n\nFor the real data, the statistical uncertainties determined on individual eclipse depths accurately describe the scatter in eclipse depths over the 10 visits.  In only one case did the uncertainty need to be increased by 50\\%.  For the simulations, most techniques required an increase of 20--60\\%, implying that the methods may need slight adjustment to allow individual uncertainties to track the increased pointing fluctuations.\n\nFor real XO-3 b data, eclipse depths are repeatable within $R\\lesssim 180\\,$ppm.  In other words, any two single eclipses are expected to be within 180\\,ppm of each other 68\\% of the time.  The most repeatable techniques have $R\\leq 100\\,$ppm, which is at the photon limit ($\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}\\approx 100$).  For the synthetic data, the repeatability is somewhat larger, $R\\lesssim 300\\,$ppm.\n\nWhen comparing the scatter in eclipse depths with the intrinsic uncertainty due to photon noise, all techniques come within a factor of 2 of the photon limit for the real data (reliability $r>0.5$).  The kernel regression techniques (KR/Data and KR/Pmap) and ICA exhibit a scatter consistent with {\\it only} photon noise ($r\\sim 1$).  For the simulations, the eclipse depth scatter is withing a factor of 2--3 of the photon limit.  Only the BLISS technique had the same value of reliability for the simulations as the real data, whereas the kernel regression techniques showed reductions of 40\\%.  Even though BLISS may not be as precise as other techniques in the best circumstances, its precision is the most robust to an increasing positional spread.  \n\nThe simulations afforded a unique view into the analysis of eclipses, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy and bias of each method based on knowledge of the true depth.  The root mean-squared eclipse depth error ranged from 2 to 3 times the photon noise limit, yielding accuracy values ranging from 0.3 to 0.6.  Most techniques obtained an average eclipse depth within 100\\,ppm of the true depth (1875\\,ppm).  \n\nWe stress that repeatability, reliability, and accuracy are statistics that refer to the quality of  {\\it single} measurements.  To say that a technique has a reliability of 0.6 means that an individual measurement of the eclipse depth has a 68\\% chance of being consistent with other measurements to within 1.6 times the photon limit (assuming Gaussian statistics).  An accuracy of 0.6 means that an individual measurement has a 68\\% chance of being within 1.6 times the photon limit of the true value. Techniques that give lower values of these quantities may nevertheless be extremely accurate when the results are averaged over multiple epochs.  For example, PLD ($r=0.54$ for simulated) has larger overall scatter in individual measurements than BLISS ($r=0.63$), but because PLD has a much lower bias than BLISS (5 vs -59, when averaged over 10 visits), both techniques have similar values of RMSE and are thus considered equally accurate ($a = 0.57$ for PLD and 0.58 for BLISS).  \n\n\\subsection{Is there a ``best'' IRAC correlated noise removal technique?}\nAfter examining the results of processing the $2\\times 10$ datasets with 7 different techniques for data reduction and eclipse depth measurement, we can make some tentative statements about the relative merits of the methods:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item When the pointing fluctuations are at a normal level, kernel regression techniques (KR/Data, KR/Pmap) and ICA return photon-limited repeatability ($r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 1$), followed by PLD with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 0.7$, BLISS and SP(K2) with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 0.6$, and GP with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 0.5$. (Here we have used inverse reliability as a normalized proxy for repeatability---see \\S3.4.2.) \n\\item BLISS is the most precise of all methods when the pointing fluctuations are larger ($r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sim}\\sim 0.6$).\n\\item The precision of BLISS is the most robust to changes in the pointing fluctuations and drift ($r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}=r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sim}$).  \n\\item  BLISS, PLD, and ICA are the most accurate and the most reliable (both $a$ and $r > 0.5$), at least when pointing fluctuations are larger (simulated data).  \n\\item PLD is the least biased of all methods. \n\\item KR/Pmap and SP(K2) return eclipse depths that are strongly biased, for both real data (they are not consistent with having the same mean as the other methods) and simulated data (their measured average biases are more than twice those of most of the other methods).\n\\end{itemize} \n\n\\subsection{Are IRAC eclipse depth uncertainties underestimated?}\n\nA recent study by \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} attempted to derive systematic uncertainties for IRAC eclipse depths.  They compared 10 2-epoch pairs of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ eclipse depth measurements for 6 different planetary systems, each epoch measured by different teams, and including measurements from 3 IRAC wavelength bands and one MIPS band, and both cryogenic and post-cryogenic data, including cryogenic IRAC data taken with dithers instead of in staring mode.  They estimated the systematic variance in each depth from the squared difference in eclipse depth values between epochs, minus the sum of reported variances (squared uncertainties) for each epoch.  This is equivalent to our estimate of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ (\\S3.2), but for a sample size of $N=2$ instead of 10.  In 5 out of 10 comparisons the difference between epochs was larger than the reported uncertainty by more than a factor of 2.  Combining results across data analysis methods, planetary systems, IRAC wavelength bands, and from both cryogenic and post-cryogenic {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}, they asserted that in general single eclipse measurements made with {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC either have an uncertainty floor of 500 ppm, or that their uncertainties should be multiplied by a factor of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}=3$.  They used their inflated uncertainties to assert that features seen in broadband spectra are more likely due to instrumental systematics than molecular bands. \n\nFollowing this, some authors have echoed the conclusions of \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}.  For example, \\citet{2015MNRAS.449.4192S} obtained theoretical estimates on the properties of 50 exoplanet atmospheres after first assuming that all reported {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ eclipse depth uncertainties have been underestimated by a factor of 3.  Most recently, a general review on the observation of exoplanet atmospheres \\citep{Crossfield:2015jd} accepted uncritically the \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} assertion regarding overestimated {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ precision, stating that, ``it is debatable whether broadband photometry usefully determines atmospheric abundances in {\\it any} transiting exoplanets [emphasis added].''\n\nOur conclusions contradict those of \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}.  To avoid the influence of confounding variables that affect measurement stability, the present paper focuses on a single planetary system, using data from a single IRAC band and single thermal regime (post-cryogenic), and involves a parallel analysis isolating different correlated noise removal techniques.  In contrast to the $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis} = 3$ estimate of \\citeauthor{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}, we have found for both real and simulated XO-3 b data that the statistical uncertainties do not need to be increased by more than 50\\% to accomodate the scatter in data [for all decorrelation methods except for SP(K2), which was created for K2 and not optimized for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}], and in many cases no inflation was necessary.  This holds even for simulated data, which had increased correlated noise and decreased spatial redundancy.  Our estimates of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ include confidence intervals based on 10-epoch samples (column 6 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim}), which vary by $\\sim\\pm\\nicefrac{1}{3} f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$.  As emphasized by \\citet{1992JPhA...25.1967L}, the uncertainty on $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ for $N=2$ \\citep[the sample size used by][]{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} is much larger, up to a few times the actual value of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$.   \n\nThe chief source of the discrepancies between separate eclipse depth measurements examined by \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} is the evolution in both observing and data reduction strategies that has occurred to accomodate exoplanet observation.  One key example of non-repeatability of IRAC eclipse depths cited by \\citeauthor{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} is the 4.5\\,$\\mu$m measurement for HD 209458b.  An early study of this hot Jupiter used broadband {\\sl Spitzer} secondary eclipse spectra from 3.6 to 24\\,$\\mu$m to infer the existence of an atmospheric inversion layer in the planet \\citep{2008ApJ...673..526K}.  These 2005 measurements were among the earliest eclipse observations made with IRAC, and were obtained using the (then) standard practice of alternating exposures between each IRAC channel, which required a repointing every 64 images.  When {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ is commanded to continuously observe an inertially fixed target (``staring'' mode), a source can be kept within a region of about 0.08\\,px diameter for one hour, while also incurring a slow linear drift of about 0.01\\,px per hour.  Experience shows that this usually yields sufficient redundancy in source position to decorrelate intra-pixel gain in a set of photometric measurements.  On the other hand, {\\sl Spitzer's} blind repointing accuracy is much worse: about 0.3\\,px RMS.  It is not surprising, then, that the 2005 measurements of HD 209458b, which were repointed every 64 frames, yielded large discontinuities in the target position, making it extremely difficult to decorrelate the data at 3.6 and 4.5\\,$\\mu$m and extract accurate eclipse depths (especially using a quadratic fit to the intra-pixel gain, as was the common practice).  Subsequent measurements of the full phase curve of HD 209458b (by a team that included two of the three authors on the earlier study) were taken in continuous staring mode with no repointing, and the data were decorrelated using kernel regression as a function of $x$, $y$, and noise pixels \\citep{2014ApJ...790...53Z}.  The new methodology resulted in a 35\\% lower 4.5\\,$\\mu$m eclipse depth that did not require an atmospheric temperature inversion.  \n\n\\citet[Table 2]{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} use the difference between the 4.5\\,$\\mu$m eclipse depth derived by \\citet{2008ApJ...673..526K} and that derived by \\citet{2014ApJ...790...53Z} as a baseline estimate of the {\\it systematic uncertainty} in {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC measurements at 4.5\\,$\\mu$m. This is incorrect, since it treats both approaches to measurement and reduction as equally valid, and equally indicative of the possible range in measurable eclipse depths---which is not true.  The 2005 IRAC measurements of HD 209458b were taken in such a way as to make virtually uncorrectable the intra-pixel systematics in the InSb arrays. In more recent years observational practice has evolved towards a more optimal staring mode configuration, especially with the 2009 advent of PCRS Peak-Up to ensure that targets are repeatably positioned (to within 0.1\\,px) in a region with minimal intra-pixel gain variations \\citep{2012SPIE.8442E..1YI}.  Eclipse data taken in this manner eliminate the discontinuous position jumps present in the 2005 data.  Also, the techniques for removing correlated noise have improved dramatically from the early days of polynomial fitting.  [Even supposing the two measurements of the HD 209458b depth {\\it were} equally valid, the value of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ computed from them ($\\sim 4.5$) would be highly uncertain, with a 68\\% confidence interval ranging from 3.2 to 22.1.]\n\nEven the flawed 2005 measurements of HD 209458b were shown to be consistent with later measurements after reanalysis using BLISS \\citep{2014ApJ...796...66D} and GP \\citep{2015MNRAS.451..680E}.  One of the criticisms made by \\citeauthor{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} was that reported uncertainties for published eclipse depths were unrealistic and did not sufficiently take into account systematics. We agree that early methods did not adequately estimate the errors, but this is not a problem in most of the newer approaches, as seen in the current paper. \n\n\\citet{Burrows:2014jd} has pointed out that observers and theorists have tended to overinterpret the earliest measurements of exoplanet atmospheres.  Ironically, \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} seem to have overinterpreted the {\\it variations} in eclipse depths.\n\n\\subsection{Application to future space missions}\nFuture space missions such as JWST \\citep{2008AdSpR..41.1983C} and TESS \\citep{2015JATIS...1a4003R}, and proposed missions such as ARIEL \\citep{2015DPS....4741620T} and FINESSE \\citep{2012SPIE.8442E..41D}, will have similar needs to verify the repeatability and accuracy of their eclipse and phase curve measurements.  These observatories will benefit from having been designed with precision measurements of transiting exoplanets in mind, so the instrumental systematics will not be as significant as for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC, where correlated noise can be as much as 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than eclipse depths.  However, systematics will still be present in future missions:  JWST will have similar jitter to pixel scale ratios as found in {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC \\citep{2014PASP..126.1134B}, which will lead to photometric variability due to intra-pixel gain fluctuations.  Furthermore, observers will demand increasingly more precise measurements as more detailed questions are asked regarding eg., atmospheric variability.  Next generation space observatories will undoubtedly be pushed to the limits of their systematic error budgets and, like {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}, require a thorough assessment of their stability and accuracy.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have performed a {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC repeatability analysis of 10 real and 10 simulated eclipses of XO-3 b using 7 correlated noise removal techniques.  Most methods are capable of estimating accurate uncertainties on individual eclipse depths.  The eclipse depth repeatability (expected difference between pairs of measurements) under normal pointing variations averages $\\sim 150\\,$ppm, only 50\\% above the photon limit, but can worsen as the spread in target positions increases.  The BLISS technique, however, is most robust to such changes.  The BLISS, PLD, and ICA techniques are the most accurate and repeatable when the pointing fluctuations are larger.\n\nA few recent publications have claimed that {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ eclipse depth uncertainties should be increased by a factor of 3.  Such claims rest upon a comparison of literature estimates of varying provenance and quality, using only 2 epochs per target, and are not substantiated by our more controlled analysis with a larger, more uniform sample.  \n\nAlthough we have controlled reasonably well for most important observing variables, our conclusions are strictly valid only for the IRAC 4.5\\micron\\ array, and in the particular signal-to-noise regime of XO-3 b (photon noise limit on an eclipse depth of $\\sim 70\\,$ppm).  As multi-epoch {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC measurements accumulate for a variety of exoplanet targets, the data will better support more broad-based repeatability analysis, which will constrain further the limits of variability for reduction techniques, and ultimately for the instrument itself.  \n\nSome of the lessons learned with IRAC can be usefully applied to future space missions.  The high degree of repeatability demonstrated in this paper was facilitated by a careful characterization and optimization of pointing during exoplanet observations \\citep{2012SPIE.8442E..1YI}.  This understanding of the systematics was greatly facilitated by a set of dedicated calibration observations.  The IRAC team has also found that hosting exoplanet data workshops and engaging the active research community has improved the quality of data greatly through optimization of observing strategies. It is shown in this paper that state of the art reduction techniques do an excellent and consistent job of mitigating systematic noise.  Focused data challenges could prove equally effective for future exoplanet space missions.\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nThis work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.

The program uses a model of the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC system to create synthetic IRAC point source measurements, outputting FITS image (or image cube) files similar to those produced by the IRAC basic calibrated data (BCD) pipeline. The simulator model is built on three major components of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC behavior: (1) pointing, (2) imaging, and (3) Fowler sampling.  We give an overview of this model here.\n\n\\subsection{Pointing}\nThe IRAC pointing model specifies the position of a point source as a function of time, ($x[t],y[t]$).  The model has four main components, based on the known structure of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ pointing variations \\citep{Grillmair:2012fq}: a high frequency fluctuation or ``jitter'' with amplitude $\\sim 0.05\\,$px; a sawtooth-shaped ``wobble'' due to a battery heater cycling on and off (period $\\sim 40$\\,min, amplitude $\\sim 0.05\\,$px); an approximately 30 minute initial drift of up to 0.1\\,px; and a long term drift of $\\sim 0.3\\,$px per day.  \\citep[See also][Figure 8 for high fidelity measurements of jitter, wobble, and drift.]{2014ApJ...793..120H}\nThe pointing as a function of time is given by:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx(t) & = & x_j(t) + x_w(t) + x_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sd}(t) + x_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} ld}(t); \\\\\ny(t) & = & y_j(t) + y_w(t) + y_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sd}(t) + y_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} ld}(t). \n\\end{eqnarray} \n\nThe jitter component is the sum of a sine wave plus a randomly generated $1/f$ noise:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx_j(t) & = & A_j\\sin[2\\pi(t-t_0)/P_j + \\phi_j]\\,\\cos(\\theta_j) + {\\bf FBM}(A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm},\\beta,t)\\\\\ny_j(t) & = & A_j\\sin[2\\pi(t-t_0)/P_j + \\phi_j]\\,\\sin(\\theta_j) + {\\bf FBM}(A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm},\\beta,t)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, $A_j$ is the jitter amplitude; $t_0$ is the time of the last spacecraft pointing reset, usually via PCRS Peak-Up; $P_j$ is the jitter period; and $\\theta_j$ is the ``axis'' of the jitter, the angle on the pixel grid (with respect to the $x$ axis) over which the sinusoidal component of jitter oscillates.  The term ${\\bf FBM}(A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm},\\beta,t)$ is a random variable representing a fractional brownian motion noise with power spectral index proportional to $f^{1/\\beta}$ and having peak amplitude $A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm}$, constructed according to the prescription of \\citet[][Section 4]{Stutzki:1998vy}.\n\nThe wobble component is modeled as a ``skewed sinusoid'':\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 77129, "prevtext": "\n\nThe scatter in the data about the true value is measured by the mean square error:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\rm MSE}& = &\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (D_{ij}-D_t)^2.\\label{mse}\\\\\n         & \\approx &{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{(B^2)}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu} + \\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}^2 + \\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} meas}^2.\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nWe now define accuracy using the square root of MSE, analagous to using SD for reliability:\n\n", "index": 29, "text": "\\begin{equation} \na \\equiv \\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}/{\\rm RMSE}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"a\\equiv\\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle}phot}/{\\rm RMSE}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub><mo>/</mo><mi>RMSE</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05101.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $A_w(t)$ is the amplitude of the wobble, $P_w(t)$ is the period, $\\phi_w$ is a constant phase shift, relative to $t_0$, and $\\phi_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sk}(t)$ is an additional phase shift that varies with time, giving $w$ its skewed shape.

The majority of the methods have RMSE values similar to their SD values, and thus accuracy nearly equal to reliability.  Figure \\ref{edepth_sim_v_r} plots $a$ as a function of $r$, along with a fit to the data, $a = 1.02\\,r$, which confirms that on average the limiting value $a\\approx r$ is reached for these techniques.  This figure shows how well a technique (1) can be relied on to give the {\\it same} eclipse depth over multiple epochs where the true depth is constant (reliability: ratio of intrinsic to actual scatter: bottom axis); and (2) can be expected to give the {\\it correct} eclipse depth over multiple epochs (accuracy: ratio of intrinsic to actual error: left axis).   It is better to be on the upper right of the plot (lower scatter, lower error) than on the lower left.\n\nIn detail the ratio $a/r$, which equals $({\\rm SD})/{\\rm RMSE}$, is not unity but varies by 20\\% among the techniques.  This ratio is (roughly) inversely proportional to the absolute value of the bias, as we can see in Figure \\ref{edepth_sim_v_r_bias}.

The bottom right displays the t-test $p$ value, giving the probability that the $t$ parameter is larger than the measured value if the null hypothesis is true (see text).  If $p<5\\%$, the null hypothesis is rejected, which we take to mean that the two techniques are not measuring the same mean eclipse depth.\n\\label{diff_real_methods}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\plotone{dchal15_diff_fake_methods.eps}\n\\caption{Altman-Bland mean/difference plots, comparing decorrelation techniques to each other for {\\bf simulated} data.  See caption to Figure \\ref{diff_real_methods} for more details.\n\\label{diff_fake_methods}}\n\\end{figure*}\nThe repeatability, reliability, and accuracy are all measures applied to the results of a single decorrelation method.  We can also conduct a more direct comparison of methods.  First, we use the mean/difference plotting method of  \\citet{Altman:1983bn} to make a visual comparison. Figures \\ref{diff_real_methods} (real) and \\ref{diff_fake_methods} display these plots for each pair of methods.  Dashed lines show the mean of the differences, ${\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{\\Delta}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}$, which estimate the relative bias between techniques; and $\\pm {\\rm SD}(\\Delta)$, which bounds the limits of variability.  Column 10 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim} list the method that gives the closest match to each of the methods of Column 1.  This was chosen as the method giving the smallest range of eclipse values, min($|{\\mkern 1.5mu\\overline{\\mkern-1.5mu{\\Delta}\\mkern-1.5mu}\\mkern 1.5mu}| + {\\rm SD(\\Delta)}$).\n\nAnother way of comparing two approaches is to use the Student's t-test to assess whether the results are drawn from a distribution with the same mean.  The test posits the null hypothesis that both sets of data have the same mean and attempts to reject it.  We use the unpaired version of the test to compute the $t$ statistic (the difference in average values divided by the combined variance) and compare with the t-distribution for the number of degrees of freedom.  The bottom right corner of each panel of Figures \\ref{diff_real_methods} and \\ref{diff_fake_methods} displays the probability that $t$ is larger than the computed value if the null hypotheses were true.  The null hypothesis is rejected if $p<5\\%$, i.e., the measured statistic is in the tail of the distribution.  In all the comparisons for simulated data and most comparisons for real data, the hypothesis is not rejected.  However, for real data, both KR/Pmap and SP(K2) are likely not to have the same mean as ICA, KR/Data, or PLD.\n\nWe can also do a global comparison of methods using analysis of variance (ANOVA) F-test, which posits the null hypothesis that {\\it all} sets of eclipse depths have the same mean.  This analysis assumes that the group of eclipse depths for each method follows a normal distribution, and that each group has approximately the same variance (usually taken to be within a factor of two of each other, which our measurements satisfy).  Similarly to the t-test, it computes a statistic and compares it with the expected distribution under the null hypothesis.  In this case the statistic is $F$, the ratio of the average variability among groups (the dispersion of group means) to the average variability within groups (average group variance), appropriately weighted by the number of degrees of freedom. (The smaller $F$ is, the more likely it is that the groups share the same mean.) The comparison distribution is the F-distribution (also known as the Fisher-Snedecor distribution), which gives the probability of measuring $F$ for the degrees of freedom, given the null hypothesis.     For the real data $F=2.8$, for which only $p=1.6\\%$ of the F-distribution has larger values, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that not all methods have the same mean.  If we remove KR/Pmap and SP(K2) from the calculation because they were the only methods that had failed t-tests, $F=0.9$.  In this case 45\\% of the distribution has larger values, and we don't reject the null hypothesis.  We conclude therefore that KR/Pmap and SP(K2) eclipse depths are biased relative to the other techniques.  For the simulated data $F=0.8$ (all techniques), for which 57\\% of the distribution has larger values, so we don't reject the hypothesis of equal means.\n\nWe emphasize that null hypothesis significance tests like t and F tests are limited in scope and predictive power.  In particular, they only allow us to {\\it reject} the hypotheses of equal means, but not to accept them.  Their probability distributions give the probability, assuming the means are equal, that the corresponding statistic has the measured value, {\\it not} the probability that the means are or are not equal given the measured statistic. Nevertheless, they still have value, at least as a first approach to an inter-method comparison.  Bayesian estimation with Monte-Carlo simulations would provide a more robust and comprehensive framework from which to analyze differences and similarities between results \\citep[eg.,][]{Killeen:2005hv,Kruschke:2013jy}, but is beyond the scope of this work.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\subsection{Repeatability and accuracy of IRAC eclipse depth measurements\\footnote{This section leaves out the SP(K2) technique, which was not developed for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}.}}\nWe have analyzed 10 real and 10 simulated eclipses of hot Jupiter XO-3 b using 7 correlated noise removal methods.  The simulations were in some ways an attempt to replicate the real data, but were given larger pointing fluctuations and drifts, increasing correlated noise and decreasing the positional redundancy that many noise removal techniques rely on.  We have found the following.\n\nFor the real data, the statistical uncertainties determined on individual eclipse depths accurately describe the scatter in eclipse depths over the 10 visits.  In only one case did the uncertainty need to be increased by 50\\%.  For the simulations, most techniques required an increase of 20--60\\%, implying that the methods may need slight adjustment to allow individual uncertainties to track the increased pointing fluctuations.\n\nFor real XO-3 b data, eclipse depths are repeatable within $R\\lesssim 180\\,$ppm.  In other words, any two single eclipses are expected to be within 180\\,ppm of each other 68\\% of the time.  The most repeatable techniques have $R\\leq 100\\,$ppm, which is at the photon limit ($\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} phot}\\approx 100$).  For the synthetic data, the repeatability is somewhat larger, $R\\lesssim 300\\,$ppm.\n\nWhen comparing the scatter in eclipse depths with the intrinsic uncertainty due to photon noise, all techniques come within a factor of 2 of the photon limit for the real data (reliability $r>0.5$).  The kernel regression techniques (KR/Data and KR/Pmap) and ICA exhibit a scatter consistent with {\\it only} photon noise ($r\\sim 1$).  For the simulations, the eclipse depth scatter is withing a factor of 2--3 of the photon limit.  Only the BLISS technique had the same value of reliability for the simulations as the real data, whereas the kernel regression techniques showed reductions of 40\\%.  Even though BLISS may not be as precise as other techniques in the best circumstances, its precision is the most robust to an increasing positional spread.  \n\nThe simulations afforded a unique view into the analysis of eclipses, allowing us to evaluate the accuracy and bias of each method based on knowledge of the true depth.  The root mean-squared eclipse depth error ranged from 2 to 3 times the photon noise limit, yielding accuracy values ranging from 0.3 to 0.6.  Most techniques obtained an average eclipse depth within 100\\,ppm of the true depth (1875\\,ppm).  \n\nWe stress that repeatability, reliability, and accuracy are statistics that refer to the quality of  {\\it single} measurements.  To say that a technique has a reliability of 0.6 means that an individual measurement of the eclipse depth has a 68\\% chance of being consistent with other measurements to within 1.6 times the photon limit (assuming Gaussian statistics).  An accuracy of 0.6 means that an individual measurement has a 68\\% chance of being within 1.6 times the photon limit of the true value. Techniques that give lower values of these quantities may nevertheless be extremely accurate when the results are averaged over multiple epochs.  For example, PLD ($r=0.54$ for simulated) has larger overall scatter in individual measurements than BLISS ($r=0.63$), but because PLD has a much lower bias than BLISS (5 vs -59, when averaged over 10 visits), both techniques have similar values of RMSE and are thus considered equally accurate ($a = 0.57$ for PLD and 0.58 for BLISS).  \n\n\\subsection{Is there a ``best'' IRAC correlated noise removal technique?}\nAfter examining the results of processing the $2\\times 10$ datasets with 7 different techniques for data reduction and eclipse depth measurement, we can make some tentative statements about the relative merits of the methods:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item When the pointing fluctuations are at a normal level, kernel regression techniques (KR/Data, KR/Pmap) and ICA return photon-limited repeatability ($r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 1$), followed by PLD with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 0.7$, BLISS and SP(K2) with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 0.6$, and GP with $r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}\\sim 0.5$. (Here we have used inverse reliability as a normalized proxy for repeatability---see \\S3.4.2.) \n\\item BLISS is the most precise of all methods when the pointing fluctuations are larger ($r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sim}\\sim 0.6$).\n\\item The precision of BLISS is the most robust to changes in the pointing fluctuations and drift ($r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} real}=r_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sim}$).  \n\\item  BLISS, PLD, and ICA are the most accurate and the most reliable (both $a$ and $r > 0.5$), at least when pointing fluctuations are larger (simulated data).  \n\\item PLD is the least biased of all methods. \n\\item KR/Pmap and SP(K2) return eclipse depths that are strongly biased, for both real data (they are not consistent with having the same mean as the other methods) and simulated data (their measured average biases are more than twice those of most of the other methods).\n\\end{itemize} \n\n\\subsection{Are IRAC eclipse depth uncertainties underestimated?}\n\nA recent study by \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} attempted to derive systematic uncertainties for IRAC eclipse depths.  They compared 10 2-epoch pairs of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ eclipse depth measurements for 6 different planetary systems, each epoch measured by different teams, and including measurements from 3 IRAC wavelength bands and one MIPS band, and both cryogenic and post-cryogenic data, including cryogenic IRAC data taken with dithers instead of in staring mode.  They estimated the systematic variance in each depth from the squared difference in eclipse depth values between epochs, minus the sum of reported variances (squared uncertainties) for each epoch.  This is equivalent to our estimate of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ (\\S3.2), but for a sample size of $N=2$ instead of 10.  In 5 out of 10 comparisons the difference between epochs was larger than the reported uncertainty by more than a factor of 2.  Combining results across data analysis methods, planetary systems, IRAC wavelength bands, and from both cryogenic and post-cryogenic {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}, they asserted that in general single eclipse measurements made with {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC either have an uncertainty floor of 500 ppm, or that their uncertainties should be multiplied by a factor of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}=3$.  They used their inflated uncertainties to assert that features seen in broadband spectra are more likely due to instrumental systematics than molecular bands. \n\nFollowing this, some authors have echoed the conclusions of \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}.  For example, \\citet{2015MNRAS.449.4192S} obtained theoretical estimates on the properties of 50 exoplanet atmospheres after first assuming that all reported {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ eclipse depth uncertainties have been underestimated by a factor of 3.  Most recently, a general review on the observation of exoplanet atmospheres \\citep{Crossfield:2015jd} accepted uncritically the \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} assertion regarding overestimated {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ precision, stating that, ``it is debatable whether broadband photometry usefully determines atmospheric abundances in {\\it any} transiting exoplanets [emphasis added].''\n\nOur conclusions contradict those of \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}.  To avoid the influence of confounding variables that affect measurement stability, the present paper focuses on a single planetary system, using data from a single IRAC band and single thermal regime (post-cryogenic), and involves a parallel analysis isolating different correlated noise removal techniques.  In contrast to the $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis} = 3$ estimate of \\citeauthor{2014MNRAS.444.3632H}, we have found for both real and simulated XO-3 b data that the statistical uncertainties do not need to be increased by more than 50\\% to accomodate the scatter in data [for all decorrelation methods except for SP(K2), which was created for K2 and not optimized for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}], and in many cases no inflation was necessary.  This holds even for simulated data, which had increased correlated noise and decreased spatial redundancy.  Our estimates of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ include confidence intervals based on 10-epoch samples (column 6 of Tables \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats} and \\ref{eclipse_depth_stats_sim}), which vary by $\\sim\\pm\\nicefrac{1}{3} f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$.  As emphasized by \\citet{1992JPhA...25.1967L}, the uncertainty on $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ for $N=2$ \\citep[the sample size used by][]{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} is much larger, up to a few times the actual value of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$.   \n\nThe chief source of the discrepancies between separate eclipse depth measurements examined by \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} is the evolution in both observing and data reduction strategies that has occurred to accomodate exoplanet observation.  One key example of non-repeatability of IRAC eclipse depths cited by \\citeauthor{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} is the 4.5\\,$\\mu$m measurement for HD 209458b.  An early study of this hot Jupiter used broadband {\\sl Spitzer} secondary eclipse spectra from 3.6 to 24\\,$\\mu$m to infer the existence of an atmospheric inversion layer in the planet \\citep{2008ApJ...673..526K}.  These 2005 measurements were among the earliest eclipse observations made with IRAC, and were obtained using the (then) standard practice of alternating exposures between each IRAC channel, which required a repointing every 64 images.  When {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ is commanded to continuously observe an inertially fixed target (``staring'' mode), a source can be kept within a region of about 0.08\\,px diameter for one hour, while also incurring a slow linear drift of about 0.01\\,px per hour.  Experience shows that this usually yields sufficient redundancy in source position to decorrelate intra-pixel gain in a set of photometric measurements.  On the other hand, {\\sl Spitzer's} blind repointing accuracy is much worse: about 0.3\\,px RMS.  It is not surprising, then, that the 2005 measurements of HD 209458b, which were repointed every 64 frames, yielded large discontinuities in the target position, making it extremely difficult to decorrelate the data at 3.6 and 4.5\\,$\\mu$m and extract accurate eclipse depths (especially using a quadratic fit to the intra-pixel gain, as was the common practice).  Subsequent measurements of the full phase curve of HD 209458b (by a team that included two of the three authors on the earlier study) were taken in continuous staring mode with no repointing, and the data were decorrelated using kernel regression as a function of $x$, $y$, and noise pixels \\citep{2014ApJ...790...53Z}.  The new methodology resulted in a 35\\% lower 4.5\\,$\\mu$m eclipse depth that did not require an atmospheric temperature inversion.  \n\n\\citet[Table 2]{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} use the difference between the 4.5\\,$\\mu$m eclipse depth derived by \\citet{2008ApJ...673..526K} and that derived by \\citet{2014ApJ...790...53Z} as a baseline estimate of the {\\it systematic uncertainty} in {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC measurements at 4.5\\,$\\mu$m. This is incorrect, since it treats both approaches to measurement and reduction as equally valid, and equally indicative of the possible range in measurable eclipse depths---which is not true.  The 2005 IRAC measurements of HD 209458b were taken in such a way as to make virtually uncorrectable the intra-pixel systematics in the InSb arrays. In more recent years observational practice has evolved towards a more optimal staring mode configuration, especially with the 2009 advent of PCRS Peak-Up to ensure that targets are repeatably positioned (to within 0.1\\,px) in a region with minimal intra-pixel gain variations \\citep{2012SPIE.8442E..1YI}.  Eclipse data taken in this manner eliminate the discontinuous position jumps present in the 2005 data.  Also, the techniques for removing correlated noise have improved dramatically from the early days of polynomial fitting.  [Even supposing the two measurements of the HD 209458b depth {\\it were} equally valid, the value of $f_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} dis}$ computed from them ($\\sim 4.5$) would be highly uncertain, with a 68\\% confidence interval ranging from 3.2 to 22.1.]\n\nEven the flawed 2005 measurements of HD 209458b were shown to be consistent with later measurements after reanalysis using BLISS \\citep{2014ApJ...796...66D} and GP \\citep{2015MNRAS.451..680E}.  One of the criticisms made by \\citeauthor{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} was that reported uncertainties for published eclipse depths were unrealistic and did not sufficiently take into account systematics. We agree that early methods did not adequately estimate the errors, but this is not a problem in most of the newer approaches, as seen in the current paper. \n\n\\citet{Burrows:2014jd} has pointed out that observers and theorists have tended to overinterpret the earliest measurements of exoplanet atmospheres.  Ironically, \\citet{2014MNRAS.444.3632H} seem to have overinterpreted the {\\it variations} in eclipse depths.\n\n\\subsection{Application to future space missions}\nFuture space missions such as JWST \\citep{2008AdSpR..41.1983C} and TESS \\citep{2015JATIS...1a4003R}, and proposed missions such as ARIEL \\citep{2015DPS....4741620T} and FINESSE \\citep{2012SPIE.8442E..41D}, will have similar needs to verify the repeatability and accuracy of their eclipse and phase curve measurements.  These observatories will benefit from having been designed with precision measurements of transiting exoplanets in mind, so the instrumental systematics will not be as significant as for {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC, where correlated noise can be as much as 2--3 orders of magnitude larger than eclipse depths.  However, systematics will still be present in future missions:  JWST will have similar jitter to pixel scale ratios as found in {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC \\citep{2014PASP..126.1134B}, which will lead to photometric variability due to intra-pixel gain fluctuations.  Furthermore, observers will demand increasingly more precise measurements as more detailed questions are asked regarding eg., atmospheric variability.  Next generation space observatories will undoubtedly be pushed to the limits of their systematic error budgets and, like {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}, require a thorough assessment of their stability and accuracy.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have performed a {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC repeatability analysis of 10 real and 10 simulated eclipses of XO-3 b using 7 correlated noise removal techniques.  Most methods are capable of estimating accurate uncertainties on individual eclipse depths.  The eclipse depth repeatability (expected difference between pairs of measurements) under normal pointing variations averages $\\sim 150\\,$ppm, only 50\\% above the photon limit, but can worsen as the spread in target positions increases.  The BLISS technique, however, is most robust to such changes.  The BLISS, PLD, and ICA techniques are the most accurate and repeatable when the pointing fluctuations are larger.\n\nA few recent publications have claimed that {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ eclipse depth uncertainties should be increased by a factor of 3.  Such claims rest upon a comparison of literature estimates of varying provenance and quality, using only 2 epochs per target, and are not substantiated by our more controlled analysis with a larger, more uniform sample.  \n\nAlthough we have controlled reasonably well for most important observing variables, our conclusions are strictly valid only for the IRAC 4.5\\micron\\ array, and in the particular signal-to-noise regime of XO-3 b (photon noise limit on an eclipse depth of $\\sim 70\\,$ppm).  As multi-epoch {\\sl Spitzer}/IRAC measurements accumulate for a variety of exoplanet targets, the data will better support more broad-based repeatability analysis, which will constrain further the limits of variability for reduction techniques, and ultimately for the instrument itself.  \n\nSome of the lessons learned with IRAC can be usefully applied to future space missions.  The high degree of repeatability demonstrated in this paper was facilitated by a careful characterization and optimization of pointing during exoplanet observations \\citep{2012SPIE.8442E..1YI}.  This understanding of the systematics was greatly facilitated by a set of dedicated calibration observations.  The IRAC team has also found that hosting exoplanet data workshops and engaging the active research community has improved the quality of data greatly through optimization of observing strategies. It is shown in this paper that state of the art reduction techniques do an excellent and consistent job of mitigating systematic noise.  Focused data challenges could prove equally effective for future exoplanet space missions.\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nThis work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.

The program uses a model of the {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC system to create synthetic IRAC point source measurements, outputting FITS image (or image cube) files similar to those produced by the IRAC basic calibrated data (BCD) pipeline. The simulator model is built on three major components of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}/IRAC behavior: (1) pointing, (2) imaging, and (3) Fowler sampling.  We give an overview of this model here.\n\n\\subsection{Pointing}\nThe IRAC pointing model specifies the position of a point source as a function of time, ($x[t],y[t]$).  The model has four main components, based on the known structure of {\\hbox{\\sl Spitzer\\/}}\\ pointing variations \\citep{Grillmair:2012fq}: a high frequency fluctuation or ``jitter'' with amplitude $\\sim 0.05\\,$px; a sawtooth-shaped ``wobble'' due to a battery heater cycling on and off (period $\\sim 40$\\,min, amplitude $\\sim 0.05\\,$px); an approximately 30 minute initial drift of up to 0.1\\,px; and a long term drift of $\\sim 0.3\\,$px per day.  \\citep[See also][Figure 8 for high fidelity measurements of jitter, wobble, and drift.]{2014ApJ...793..120H}\nThe pointing as a function of time is given by:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx(t) & = & x_j(t) + x_w(t) + x_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sd}(t) + x_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} ld}(t); \\\\\ny(t) & = & y_j(t) + y_w(t) + y_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sd}(t) + y_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} ld}(t). \n\\end{eqnarray} \n\nThe jitter component is the sum of a sine wave plus a randomly generated $1/f$ noise:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx_j(t) & = & A_j\\sin[2\\pi(t-t_0)/P_j + \\phi_j]\\,\\cos(\\theta_j) + {\\bf FBM}(A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm},\\beta,t)\\\\\ny_j(t) & = & A_j\\sin[2\\pi(t-t_0)/P_j + \\phi_j]\\,\\sin(\\theta_j) + {\\bf FBM}(A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm},\\beta,t)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, $A_j$ is the jitter amplitude; $t_0$ is the time of the last spacecraft pointing reset, usually via PCRS Peak-Up; $P_j$ is the jitter period; and $\\theta_j$ is the ``axis'' of the jitter, the angle on the pixel grid (with respect to the $x$ axis) over which the sinusoidal component of jitter oscillates.  The term ${\\bf FBM}(A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm},\\beta,t)$ is a random variable representing a fractional brownian motion noise with power spectral index proportional to $f^{1/\\beta}$ and having peak amplitude $A_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} fbm}$, constructed according to the prescription of \\citet[][Section 4]{Stutzki:1998vy}.\n\nThe wobble component is modeled as a ``skewed sinusoid'':\n\n", "index": 31, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nw(t) = A_w(t)\\,\\sin[2\\pi(t-t_0)/P_w(t) + \\phi_w + \\phi_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} sk}(t)],\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E16.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"w(t)=A_{w}(t)\\,\\sin[2\\pi(t-t_{0})/P_{w}(t)+\\phi_{w}+\\phi_{{\\rm%&#10;\\scriptscriptstyle}sk}(t)],\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>w</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>w</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>w</mi></msub></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>w</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05101.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nHere, $S_w$ is the phase of the peak amplitude (as a fraction of the period), which defines the amount of skewness.

The sample time $\\Delta t$ is fixed at 0.2\\,s for full array readout and 0.01\\,s for subarray readout.   At the beginning of an IRAC measurement, each detector (pixel) is reset.  Charge is then accumulated due to photoelectron production and noise.  The accumulated charge in a pixel is read out every $\\Delta t$ seconds, for FN ``pedestal'' reads, $P_i(t)$, WT ``wait'' samples are skipped, and FN ``signal'' reads, $S_i(t)$ are measured.  Figure \\ref{IRAC_lightcurve_model} ({\\it a}) is a schematic depiction of Fowler sampling, and its relationship with the pointing model. \n\nEach data file contains either 1 $256\\times 256$-pixel image for full array readout mode, or 64 $32\\times 32$-pixel images for subarray readout.  Define $\\delta t$ as the rate at which the pointing model is sampled.  The total charge accumulated in one pointing sample at time t is $e(i_p,j_p,t) = \\dot{e}(i_p,j_p,t)\\delta t.$  Let the Fowler sample time $\\Delta t$ be an integer multiple of $\\delta t$.  Typically we use $\\delta t = \\Delta t/10$, so there are $n=10$ PRF realizations per Fowler sample.  We compute $e(i_p,j_p,t)$ every $\\delta t$ seconds over the course of the entire integration, which lasts $t_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} int} = [2({\\rm FN}) + {\\rm WT}]\\Delta t = [2({\\rm FN}) + {\\rm WT}]n\\delta t$ seconds.  The number of total model samples in the integration is therefore $N{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} samp} = [2({\\rm FN}) + {\\rm WT}]n$.  \n\nThe accumulated charge is stored for {\\it every} Fowler sampling interval (starting at $P_1$ and ending at $S_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} FN}$), including the wait ticks for proper noise accumulation.

Panel ({\\it a}) shows the charge on a pixel as a function of time during an IRAC measurement.  We indicate the location of the Fowler sampling ``pedestal'' $P_i$ and ``sample'' $S_i$ measurements, for $FN=4$ and $WT=5$.  (This sampling yields a nonstandard frame time of 2.6\\,s, shown here only for illustrative purposes.)  The IRAC sample time is shown as $\\Delta t$, and the time resolution of the simulation $\\delta t$ is indicated. Panels ({\\it b}) and ({\\it c}) indicate the time evolution of the $x$ and $y$ pixel position of a point source on an IRAC array.  Panel ({\\it d}) displays the raw lightcurve for an unresolved eclipsing planetary system $L(t)$. Gray boxes on panels ({\\it b}), ({\\it c}), and ({\\it d}) show where the pixel sampling in panel ({\\it a}) takes place.\\label{IRAC_lightcurve_model}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nGiven $\\dot{e}(i_p,j_p,t)$, a function that can be evaluated at arbitrary time, we produce a simulated IRAC image by mimicking the integration and sampling properties of the IRAC electronics.  \n\nIRAC acquires data using the Fowler-sampling technique, defined by the sample time, $\\Delta t$, the Fowler number, FN, and the Wait Ticks, WT (IRAC Instrument Handbook, section 2.4).  The sample time $\\Delta t$ is fixed at 0.2\\,s for full array readout and 0.01\\,s for subarray readout.   At the beginning of an IRAC measurement, each detector (pixel) is reset.  Charge is then accumulated due to photoelectron production and noise.  The accumulated charge in a pixel is read out every $\\Delta t$ seconds, for FN ``pedestal'' reads, $P_i(t)$, WT ``wait'' samples are skipped, and FN ``signal'' reads, $S_i(t)$ are measured.  Figure \\ref{IRAC_lightcurve_model} ({\\it a}) is a schematic depiction of Fowler sampling, and its relationship with the pointing model. \n\nEach data file contains either 1 $256\\times 256$-pixel image for full array readout mode, or 64 $32\\times 32$-pixel images for subarray readout.  Define $\\delta t$ as the rate at which the pointing model is sampled.  The total charge accumulated in one pointing sample at time t is $e(i_p,j_p,t) = \\dot{e}(i_p,j_p,t)\\delta t.$  Let the Fowler sample time $\\Delta t$ be an integer multiple of $\\delta t$.  Typically we use $\\delta t = \\Delta t/10$, so there are $n=10$ PRF realizations per Fowler sample.  We compute $e(i_p,j_p,t)$ every $\\delta t$ seconds over the course of the entire integration, which lasts $t_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} int} = [2({\\rm FN}) + {\\rm WT}]\\Delta t = [2({\\rm FN}) + {\\rm WT}]n\\delta t$ seconds.  The number of total model samples in the integration is therefore $N{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} samp} = [2({\\rm FN}) + {\\rm WT}]n$.  \n\nThe accumulated charge is stored for {\\it every} Fowler sampling interval (starting at $P_1$ and ending at $S_{{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle} FN}$), including the wait ticks for proper noise accumulation.
