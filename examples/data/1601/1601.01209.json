However, all of these studies only employed simplified two-stream radiative transfer schemes to describe the anisotropic scattering.\nUsing accurate radiative transfer models with a general discrete ordinate method, this study revisits this important effect and shows that the \npositive climatic impact of carbon dioxide \nclouds was strongly overestimated in the past. The revised scattering greenhouse effect can have important implications for the early Mars, but also \nfor planets like the early Earth or the position of the outer boundary of the habitable zone.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\keywords{planets and satellites: atmospheres --- astrobiology --- radiative transfer}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nClouds are common in the atmospheres of Solar System planets and are likely ubiquitous in those of extrasolar planets as well. They \naffect every aspect of a planetary atmosphere, from radiative transfer, to atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, and they influence -- if not \ncontrol -- aspects such as the surface temperature and, thus, the potential habitability of a terrestrial planet \\citep{Marley2013cctp.book..367M}. \nUnderstanding the impact of clouds is thus instrumental for the study of planetary climates.\n\nClouds composed of carbon dioxide (\\ce{CO2}) ice particles are important for cold, \\ce{CO2}-rich atmospheres. This includes, for example, the present \nand early Mars \\citep{Forget1997}, the early Earth \\citep{Caldeira1992Natur.359..226C}, or terrestrial exoplanets at the outer boundary of the \nhabitable \nzone \\citep{Forget1997, Kasting1993}.\nProvided that condensation nuclei are available, such clouds would form easily in a supersaturated atmosphere. \n\nLike for water clouds (e.g. \\citet{Kitzmann2010A&A...511A..66K}), the presence of \\ce{CO2} clouds will firstly result in an increase of the planetary \nalbedo by scattering incident stellar radiation back to space which leads to a cooling effect (albedo effect). In contrast to liquid or solid \nwater, \\ce{CO2} ice is mostly transparent with respect to absorption in the infrared \\citep{Hansen1997JGR, Hansen2005JGRE}.\nThus, as argued by \\citet{Forget1997} or \\citet{Kasting1993}, a classical greenhouse effect by absorption and re-emission of thermal radiation is \nunlikely to occur for a cloud composed of dry ice. On the other hand, \\ce{CO2} ice particles can efficiently scatter thermal radiation back to the \nplanetary surface, thereby exhibiting a scattering greenhouse effect. In their seminal study, Forget \\& Pierrehumbert \n\\cite{Forget1997} \nshowed that this scattering greenhouse effect of \\ce{CO2} ice clouds alone would have been efficient enough to allow for liquid water on the surface \nof the early Mars. \nThis strong heating effect was also found in later studies  by e.g. \\citet{Pierrehumbert1998JAtS}, \\citet{Mischna2000Icar}, or \n\\citet{Colaprete2003}. However, by using \nthree-dimensional general circulation models, it has been suggested, that a limiting factor for the impact of \n\\ce{CO2} clouds on early Mars might be the cloud coverage, which could be well below 100\\% \\citep{Forget2013Icar..222...81F}.\n\nEspecially, the outer boundary of the classical habitable zone (HZ) might also be influenced by the formation of \\ce{CO2} ice \nclouds and their corresponding climatic impact. For the Sun, \\citet{Forget1997} reported an outer HZ boundary of 2.4 au for a planet fully covered \nwith \\ce{CO2} clouds, which is far larger than the cloud-free value of 1.67 au \\citet{Kasting1993}. \n\nThe competing radiative cooling and heating effects are individually large, but partly balance each other. That means that small errors in the \ndescription of one of these radiative interactions can lead to large errors in a cloud's net effect.\nSo far, all previous studies on the climatic impact of \\ce{CO2} clouds used a simplified treatment for the numerical solution of the radiative \ntransfer equation to determine the atmospheric and surface temperatures. \nIn particular, two-stream methods \\citep{Toon1989JGR....9416287T} have exclusively been used. \nWith only two angular directions available to determine the radiation field, these methods provide only limited means to describe e.g. the scattering \nphase function of the \\ce{CO2} ice particles well enough to yield accurate results for describing radiative effects based on anisotropic scattering.\n\nIn a numerical radiative transfer study by \\citet{Kitzmann2013A&A...557A...6K}, it was shown that these simplified two-stream methods underestimate \nthe albedo effect at short wavelengths and overestimate the back-scattering of thermal radiation which forms the basis of the scattering greenhouse \neffect. However, this previous study did not use an atmospheric model and, thus, was unable to estimate the impact of a more accurate description of \nthe scattering greenhouse effect on the surface temperature.\n\nIn this study, I will therefore re-asses the climatic impact of \\ce{CO2} clouds using a sophisticated radiative transfer scheme. \nSince most of the studies related to the climatic impact of \\ce{CO2} ice clouds have been done for early Mars, I will use the same modeling \nscenario to compare my atmospheric model calculations with the previously published results. \n\n\n\\section{Model description}\n\nTo investigate the impact of \\ce{CO2} ice clouds, I use a one-dimensional radiative-convective climate model. The model incorporates \na state-of-the-art radiative transfer treatment based on a discrete ordinate method \\citep{Hamre2013AIPC.1531..923H} which is able to treat the \nanisotropic scattering by cloud particles accurately \\citep{Kitzmann2013A&A...557A...6K}. \n\nThe atmospheric model is stationary, i.e. it doesn't contain an explicit time dependence, and assumes hydrostatic equilibrium. About one hundred grid \npoints are used to resolve the vertical extension of the atmosphere. The model currently considers \\ce{N2}, \\ce{CO2} and \\ce{H2O}. Of those, only \n\\ce{CO2} and \\ce{H2O} are, however, used in this study.\n\nThe temperature profile is calculated from the requirement of radiative equilibrium by a time-stepping approach, as well as performing a convective \nadjustment, if necessary. The convective lapse rate is assumed to be adiabatic, taking into account the condensation of \\ce{H2O}\nand \\ce{CO2}. A surface albedo of 0.215 based on measurements of present Mars is used \\citep{Kieffer1977JGR....82.4249K}.\nA more detailed model description will be presented in \\citet{Kitzmann2016inprep}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Radiative transfer}\n\nIn contrast to many other atmospheric models for terrestrial exoplanets, the radiative transfer of this study is not separated into two different \nwavelength regimes.

In practice the series is truncated at a certain \n$n=N_\\mathrm{max}$. For discrete ordinate methods the number of moments $N_\\mathrm{max}$ is \nequal to the number of ordinates (streams) considered in the radiative transfer equation \\citep{Chandrasekhar1960ratr}.\n\nThe equation of radiative transfer is solved by the discrete ordinate solver C-DISORT \\citep{Hamre2013AIPC.1531..923H}. In contrast to \ntwo-stream methods, it yields the mathematically exact solution of the transfer equation for a given set of transport coefficients and phase \nfunctions, provided that enough computational streams are included.\nFor this study, eight streams are used for all model calculations. Doubling the number of streams has no impact on the resulting radiation \nfluxes and surface temperatures.\n\nThe wavelength-dependent absorption by atmospheric molecules and clouds is treated by the opacity sampling method, which is one of the standard \nmethods employed in cool stellar atmospheres \\citep{Sneden1976ApJ...204..281S}. In contrast to the $k$-distribution method with the correlated-$k$ \nassumption, opacity sampling still operates in the usual wavelength/wavenumber space \\citep{Mihalas1978stat.book.....M}. \nThis approach has the advantage, that absorption coefficients of all atmospheric constituents are \nfully additive. Essentially, opacity sampling can be regarded as a degraded line-by-line formalism. It is based \non the fact that the wavelength integral of the radiation flux converges already well before \nall spectral lines are fully resolved. At each single wavelength, however, the solution with the opacity sampling method is identical to a \ncorresponding line-by-line radiative transfer.\n\nFor this study, the distribution of the wavelength points at which the equation of radiative transfer is solved, is treated separately in three \ndifferent wavelength regions. In the infrared, the points are sampled along the Planck black body curves for different temperatures. This method is \nadopted from \\citet{Helling1998A&A} and guarantees an accurate treatment of the thermal radiation with a small number of wavelength points. In the \nvisible and near infrared region, 10000 wavelength points are distributed equidistantly in wavenumbers. This region is most important for the \ntemperature profile in the upper atmosphere where the temperatures are essentially determined by absorption of stellar radiation within \nwell-separated lines. Beyond the visible wavelength region, about 100 points are used to cover the smooth Rayleigh scattering slope and resolving the \nstellar Lyman alpha emission line. In total about 12500 discrete wavelength points are used here. Tests by increasing the wavelength resolution show \nvirtually no change in the wavelength-integrated flux. In fact, the high number of integration points in the near infrared region could also be \ndecreased if one is not interested in the temperatures near the top-of-the atmosphere.\n\nAbsorption cross-sections for \\ce{CO2} and \\ce{H2O} are calculated as described in \\citet{Wordsworth2013ApJ...778..154W}, using the HITRAN 2012 \ndatabase \\citep{Rothman2013JQSRT.130....4R}. For these calculations, the open source \\textit{Kspectrum} code (version 1.2.0) is used. In case of \n\\ce{CO2}, the sub-Lorentzian line profiles of \\citet{Perrin1989JQSRT..42..311P} are employed, while the contribution of collision induced absorption \nis \ntaken from \\citet{Baranov2003JMoSp.218..260B}. The continuum absorption of \\ce{H2O} is derived from the MT-CKD description \n\\citep{Mlawer2012RSPTA.370.2520M}.

To simulate the conditions for early Mars with a less luminous Sun, the incident stellar flux is set to 75\\% of the present-day \nMartian Solar irradiance. A high-resolution spectrum of the present-day Sun from \\citet{Gueymard2004} is used for the spectral energy distribution of \nthe incident stellar flux.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{2d_single.pdf}\n\t\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Impact of \\ce{CO2} ice clouds on the surface temperature.} Surface temperatures are shown as a function of \noptical depth (at a wavelength of $\\lambda = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) and effective particle size of the \\ce{CO2} ice clouds. The black contour \nlines are given in steps of 5 K. The white contour line indicates the clear-sky case.}\n\t\\label{fig:surface_temp_2d}\n\\end{figure}\n\nBecause a supersaturated \\ce{CO2}-rich atmosphere would provide a huge amount of condensible material, dry ice \nparticles would grow rapidly, thereby potentially reaching large particle sizes under these conditions. The only detailed microphysical study for \nparticle formation on early Mars obtained mean particle sizes of the order of \\unit[1000]{\\micro m} \\citep{Colaprete2003}. \nThus, to cover this very wide parameter range, the effective particle sizes are varied between \\unit[10]{\\micro m} and \\unit[1000]{\\micro m} in the \nfollowing. A total cloud coverage is assumed to obtain an upper limit for the clouds' climatic impact. The cloud layer is placed into the \nsupersaturated region of the cloud-free atmosphere around a pressure of 0.1 bar. This corresponds roughly to the \nposition of the cloud layer in \\citet{Forget1997} and \\citet{Mischna2000Icar}.\n\nSince the publication of \\citet{Forget1997} or \\citet{Mischna2000Icar}, several updates to the molecular line lists and description of the molecule's \ncontinuum absorption were introduced. While the greenhouse effect of \\ce{CO2} became less effective \\citep{Wordsworth2010Icar..210..992W}, the  \nabsorptivity of \\ce{H2O} increased, especially due to changes in the continuum absorption \\citep{Mlawer2012RSPTA.370.2520M} and the line \nparameters \\citep{Rothman2013JQSRT.130....4R}. Therefore, to limit the impact of the different molecular line lists on the comparison, only \\ce{CO2} \nis considered as an atmospheric gas in the following. This corresponds to the ``dry case'' in \\citet{Forget1997}. \n \nIn the clear-sky case, the surface temperature is about 220 K and thus roughly 8 K smaller than reported by \\citet{Forget1997} and \n\\citet{Mischna2000Icar}. This is caused by a revised collision induced absorption (CIA) of the \\ce{CO2} gas, yielding a smaller greenhouse \neffect \\citep{Wordsworth2010Icar..210..992W}. \n\nThe resulting surface temperatures for the cloudy cases are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:surface_temp_2d} as a function of the \ncloud particle sizes and optical depth. In total, several hundreds of individual model calculations have been performed to obtain the results in Fig. \n\\ref{fig:surface_temp_2d}.\n\nIn agreement with previous studies \\citep{Forget1997, Pierrehumbert1998JAtS, Mischna2000Icar, Colaprete2003}, \\ce{CO2} particles with effective radii \nlarger than about \\unit[10]{\\micro m} can result in a net greenhouse effect. \nAn efficient greenhouse effect, however, is only possible within a certain particle size range and for medium values of the optical depth. \nParticles larger than roughly \\unit[500]{\\micro m} are more or less neutral or - at high optical depths - even exhibit a net cooling effect. \nThese particles are too large to feature an efficient back-scattering of the upwelling thermal radiation. Their large asymmetry parameters at thermal \ninfrared wavelengths results in thermal radiation being predominantly scattered in the upward direction and, thus, away from the surface. \nIn order to obtain the highest possible greenhouse effect, the particle sizes must be comparable to the wavelength of the\natmospheric thermal radiation below the cloud layer (cf. also \\citet{Kitzmann2013A&A...557A...6K}). This is only the case for $a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \n\\approx \\unit[25]{\\micro m}$ which therefore provides the largest net greenhouse effect.\n\nIn no case studied here, the freezing point of water is reached - quite in contrast to previous studies where \nsurface temperatures in excess of \\unit[300]{K} had been found for the same scenario \\citep{Forget1997}.\nThe highest surface temperatures obtained for a pure 2 bar \\ce{CO2} atmosphere are about \\unit[252]{K}. \nEven considering the \\unit[8]{K} difference due to the \nrevised \\ce{CO2} CIA, the differences in the resulting surfaces temperatures between the different radiative transfer approaches are astonishingly \nlarge. However, it should be noted, that the lower collision induced absorption of the \\ce{CO2} molecules might also influence the \nresulting scattering greenhouse effect of the ice particles to a certain extend.\n\nA direct comparison of the climatic impact with the previous studies of \\citet{Forget1997} and \\citet{Mischna2000Icar} is shown in Fig.  \n\\ref{fig:contour_sizes}. Note, that \\citet{Forget1997} only used two effective radii (10 and \\unit[50]{\\micro m}), while \\citet{Mischna2000Icar} is \nlimited to a single value of \\unit[10]{\\micro m} and studies only atmospheres saturated with water vapor.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{contour_lines_sizes_dry.pdf}\n\t\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Comparison of the impact of \\ce{CO2} clouds on the surface temperature with previous studies.} The diagram shows the changes of the \n\t\tsurface temperature in the presence of \\ce{CO2} ice clouds ($T_\\mathrm{cloudy}$) with respect to the clear-sky case ($T_\\mathrm{clear-sky}$), \n\t\tcompared to the results of \\citet{Forget1997} and \\citet{Mischna2000Icar}.

Again, \nthe temperature increases due to the scattering greenhouse effect are between 20 and 30 K smaller than those found in \\citet{Forget1997} or \n\\citet{Mischna2000Icar} for this particular case. \nAdditionally, \\citet{Colaprete2003} also claimed a strong greenhouse effect for particle sizes of several hundred \\unit{\\micro m}, \nwhich, as already shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:surface_temp_2d}, is clearly not the case.\n\nThe presence of \\ce{CO2} clouds also has a profound impact on the temperature profile, as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:temperture_profiles}. \nDue to their scattering greenhouse effect, they strongly increase the atmospheric temperature \\textit{locally}, just below the cloud base. This \ninhibits convection and creates a temperature profile where the usual fully convective troposphere is changed into a lower convective region near the \nsurface and a second one above the cloud layer. \nBoth convective regions are separated by a temperature profile determined by radiative equilibrium (see also \\citet{Mischna2000Icar}). The local \nheating due to the cloud particles is in fact strong enough to cause their evaporation. Thus, such a cloud layer would be unable to persist in \nstationary equilibrium \\citep{Colaprete2003}. Placing the cloud layer even higher up in the atmosphere would also result in the strong local heating.\n\nOverall, the Bond albedos in the cloudy cases are somewhat higher than the ones of the reported by the previous studies. This is caused by the \nunderestimation of the cloud's albedo effect by the two-stream radiative transfer schemes \\citep{Kitzmann2013A&A...557A...6K}.\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\nIn this study, the potential impact of scattering greenhouse effect of \\ce{CO2} ice clouds on the surface temperature is revisited by using an \natmospheric model with an accurate radiative transfer method. By comparison with previous model studies on the early Mars, the results suggest \nthat the potential heating effect was strongly overestimated in the past.\n\nBased on the results presented here, it is, therefore, strongly recommended that atmospheric models which include the climatic effect of \\ce{CO2} ice \nclouds should employ more suitable radiative transfer schemes. Additionally, previous model calculations involving the effect of \\ce{CO2} ice clouds, \nsuch as for the position of the outer boundary of the habitable zone or the atmosphere of early Mars for example, clearly require to be revisited. \nThis study also emphasizes the importance of using detailed radiative schemes when studying phenomena based on anisotropic scattering.\n\nWhile the results for the scattering greenhouse effect found in this study are by far smaller than those reported by previous studies, this doesn't \nmean that \\ce{CO2} ice clouds are overall ineffective in warming planetary atmospheres. On the contrary, they can still provide an important \ncontribution to the greenhouse effect in a certain parameter range. Thus, the original idea brought up by Forget \\& Pierrehumbert in their pilot \nstudy about a net scattering greenhouse effect still prevails, albeit much smaller than originally anticipated.\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nD.K. would like to thank Y.

In practice the series is truncated at a certain \n$n=N_\\mathrm{max}$. For discrete ordinate methods the number of moments $N_\\mathrm{max}$ is \nequal to the number of ordinates (streams) considered in the radiative transfer equation \\citep{Chandrasekhar1960ratr}.\n\nThe equation of radiative transfer is solved by the discrete ordinate solver C-DISORT \\citep{Hamre2013AIPC.1531..923H}. In contrast to \ntwo-stream methods, it yields the mathematically exact solution of the transfer equation for a given set of transport coefficients and phase \nfunctions, provided that enough computational streams are included.\nFor this study, eight streams are used for all model calculations. Doubling the number of streams has no impact on the resulting radiation \nfluxes and surface temperatures.\n\nThe wavelength-dependent absorption by atmospheric molecules and clouds is treated by the opacity sampling method, which is one of the standard \nmethods employed in cool stellar atmospheres \\citep{Sneden1976ApJ...204..281S}. In contrast to the $k$-distribution method with the correlated-$k$ \nassumption, opacity sampling still operates in the usual wavelength/wavenumber space \\citep{Mihalas1978stat.book.....M}. \nThis approach has the advantage, that absorption coefficients of all atmospheric constituents are \nfully additive. Essentially, opacity sampling can be regarded as a degraded line-by-line formalism. It is based \non the fact that the wavelength integral of the radiation flux converges already well before \nall spectral lines are fully resolved. At each single wavelength, however, the solution with the opacity sampling method is identical to a \ncorresponding line-by-line radiative transfer.\n\nFor this study, the distribution of the wavelength points at which the equation of radiative transfer is solved, is treated separately in three \ndifferent wavelength regions. In the infrared, the points are sampled along the Planck black body curves for different temperatures. This method is \nadopted from \\citet{Helling1998A&A} and guarantees an accurate treatment of the thermal radiation with a small number of wavelength points. In the \nvisible and near infrared region, 10000 wavelength points are distributed equidistantly in wavenumbers. This region is most important for the \ntemperature profile in the upper atmosphere where the temperatures are essentially determined by absorption of stellar radiation within \nwell-separated lines. Beyond the visible wavelength region, about 100 points are used to cover the smooth Rayleigh scattering slope and resolving the \nstellar Lyman alpha emission line. In total about 12500 discrete wavelength points are used here. Tests by increasing the wavelength resolution show \nvirtually no change in the wavelength-integrated flux. In fact, the high number of integration points in the near infrared region could also be \ndecreased if one is not interested in the temperatures near the top-of-the atmosphere.\n\nAbsorption cross-sections for \\ce{CO2} and \\ce{H2O} are calculated as described in \\citet{Wordsworth2013ApJ...778..154W}, using the HITRAN 2012 \ndatabase \\citep{Rothman2013JQSRT.130....4R}. For these calculations, the open source \\textit{Kspectrum} code (version 1.2.0) is used. In case of \n\\ce{CO2}, the sub-Lorentzian line profiles of \\citet{Perrin1989JQSRT..42..311P} are employed, while the contribution of collision induced absorption \nis \ntaken from \\citet{Baranov2003JMoSp.218..260B}. The continuum absorption of \\ce{H2O} is derived from the MT-CKD description \n\\citep{Mlawer2012RSPTA.370.2520M}. Rayleigh scattering is considered for \\ce{CO2} and \\ce{H2O} \\citep{vonParis2010A&A...522A..23V}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Cloud description}\n\nThe atmospheric model also takes the radiative effect of clouds directly into account.
