As discussed in section \\ref{sec:memory},\na memory of this potential is carried by the system in this theory, and it is not entirely\nobvious what would serve to erase its memory. I will assume that this occurs when there is\nany collision, i.e., when the proton approaches another nucleus, coming within the range of the\nstrong nuclear force. Some protons on earth were formed during big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), but\nothers have participated in collisions at the cores of stars.\nStill others will have undergone their last collision during a type I supernova, near\nthe surface of a white dwarf star.\nIt is a consequence of the model in {ref.~\\cite{lebed}}\\ that all these classes of protons differ\nin their subsequent behavior. Since {ref.~\\cite{lebed}}\\ assumes a static spacetime, we will not consider the\nBBN component, which has existed over cosmological timescales.

Some protons on earth were formed during big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), but\nothers have participated in collisions at the cores of stars.\nStill others will have undergone their last collision during a type I supernova, near\nthe surface of a white dwarf star.\nIt is a consequence of the model in {ref.~\\cite{lebed}}\\ that all these classes of protons differ\nin their subsequent behavior.
