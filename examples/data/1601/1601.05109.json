We focus \nhere on studying the properties of trapping horizons within spherical symmetry \n(which gives some simplifications while retaining the most essential general \nfeatures). Their locations are then given by exactly the same condition ($R=2M$) \nas for the event horizon in the vacuum Schwarzschild metric, and the same \ncondition also applies for cosmological trapping horizons. We have investigated \nthe causal nature of these horizons (\\emph{i.e.} whether they are spacelike, \ntimelike or null), making contact with the Misner-Sharp formalism, which has \noften been used for numerical calculations of spherical collapse. We follow two \ndifferent approaches, one using a geometrical quantity $\\alpha$ and the other \nusing the horizon velocity measured with respect to the collapsing (or \nexpanding) matter. Simple expressions are found for each of these in terms of \nlocal fluid parameters, and the connection between them allows a full \ndescription of the possible behaviours, depending on the initial density profile \nand the equation of state. After revisiting the FLRW universe model and the \npressureless Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model in the light of this, we have \ncarried out numerical simulations for stellar collapse with non-zero pressure, \nmaking contact with pioneering calculations from the 1960s where some features \nof the emergence and subsequent behaviour of trapping horizons could already be \nseen. More extensive numerical investigations, studying a wider range of models, \nwill be presented in a subsequent paper. \n\n\\blfootnote{\\texttt{alexis.helou@physik.uni-muenchen.de} }\n\\blfootnote{\\texttt{ilia.musco@obspm.fr}} \n\\blfootnote{\\texttt{john.miller@physics.ox.ac.uk} }\n\n\\newpage\n\\section{Introduction}\n \\label{section_intro}\n\nThe usual concept of a black hole is associated with a region of spacetime from \nwhich nothing can ever escape, including light rays. Any observer who remains \noutside its outer boundary (called the \\emph{event horizon}) can never know \nanything about what happens inside. In the simplest mathematical picture, black \nholes are envisaged as eternal unchanging vacuum objects for which one knows the \nentire global structure of the spacetime, but real black holes are not eternal \nand unchanging: they are born, interact with their surroundings and will \nprobably eventually evaporate away. \n\nAstrophysical black holes can be formed in various ways, with their masses \nspanning a very large range, from very small ones formed in the early Universe \nup to supermassive ones formed in the centres of galaxies. The simplest \nformation scenario concerns collapse of a single object, such as a star or gas \ncloud, whose internal pressure becomes inadequate to support it. The collapse \nitself is a dynamical process and subsequent accretion or interactions with \nsurrounding objects can lead to further changes. For studying black holes which \nare changing, it is necessary to define them in terms of local concepts which do \nnot depend on knowing the entire global structure of the four-dimensional \nspacetime. The notion of trapped surfaces, from which null-rays cannot expand \noutwards, provides such a local definition, which can replace the global one \nbased on the event horizon: a black hole is the region of trapped surfaces, and \nits boundary (the \\emph{horizon}) is the hypersurface that separates trapped \nsurfaces from untrapped ones. In fact the characterisation of trapped surfaces \nis strictly ``quasi-local'' rather than local, since they are closed spacelike \nsurfaces, rather than just points \\cite{Krishnan:2013saa}. Alternatively, \nwe may understand the term quasi-local as referring to a quantity which can be \nmeasured by an observer in a finite lifespan experiment \\cite{Faraoni:2015ula}.\n\nThere are several different quasi-local definitions of black hole horizons in\nthe literature, \\emph{e.g.} the apparent horizon \\cite{Hawking:1973uf}, the\ntrapping horizon \\cite{Hayward:1993wb}, the isolated horizon\n\\cite{Ashtekar:2000sz}, the dynamical horizon \\cite{Ashtekar:2002ag, Ashtekar:2003hk}, \nand the slowly-evolving horizon \\cite{Booth:2003ji}. We\nrecommend \\cite{Ashtekar:2004cn} and \\cite{Faraoni:2013aba} for extensive reviews\nof these concepts.\n\nWe recall that while physical objects are constrained to follow either timelike \ntrajectories (if they have non-zero rest mass) or null trajectories (if they are \nmassless), horizons do not have this constraint and could also be spacelike \n(\\emph{i.e.} they could be superluminal, moving outside the local lightcone). An \nalternative way of saying this is that the \\emph{signature} of the horizon could \nbe \\emph{spacelike}, as well as \\emph{null} or \\emph{timelike}. A main focus of \nthe work presented here is on following this causal nature of horizons during \ngravitational collapse to form a black hole. Within the different definitions of quasi-local \nhorizons, the isolated horizon is always null, the dynamical horizon can only be \nspacelike or null and the slowly evolving horizon has to remain close to being \nnull. These different definitions each refer to restricted classes, and we \npreferred to work here with the more general concept of \\emph{trapping \nhorizons}, as defined by Hayward \\cite{Hayward:1993wb}, which can have any \nsignature. As we will see, this notion is very general and applies also in \ncosmology and for other situations where trapping occurs \\cite{Hayward:1993wb, Helou:2015zma}. \nThe full trapping horizon is a 3D surface in 4D spacetime, \nbut in order to follow collapse as a Cauchy problem, with the specification of \ninitial data which is then evolved forward in time, we follow the standard \npractice of considering the horizon as a 2D surface which evolves with time. \nThis 2D surface is often called an ``apparent horizon'' but in the literature, the terms \napparent/trapping horizons are often used as synonymous \\cite{Poisson, Visser:2014zqa}.\n\n\nAs a preliminary for our analysis, we relate the standard geometrical machinery \nused for studying trapping horizons with the hydrodynamical formalism of Misner \n\\& Sharp \\cite{Misner:1964je,May:1966zz}, which we use later for studying \ndynamical black holes in spherical symmetry\\footnote{Note that there are two \ndifferent formulations of this which were developed separately, the second being \nthat of May \\& White \\cite{May:1966zz} which they then implemented in their \nnumerical investigations. The two formulations are essentially equivalent but \nthe notations are different in some respects. What we describe here as the \n``Misner-Sharp'' approach is, in fact, a composite of the two.}. We show that the \ngeometrical and Misner-Sharp approaches are completely consistent with each \nother but give alternative frameworks for understanding the behaviour being \nstudied. Following either approach, one reaches the result that the condition \n$R=2M$ (where $M$ is the ``mass contained within radius $R$'', see Section \n\\ref{section_trapping_horizon} for more precise definitions)\nis not only associated with the event horizon of the vacuum Schwarzschild \nmetric\\footnote{In stationary spacetimes, there is no difference between event \nand quasi-local horizons, and the characteristic $R=2M$ is usually attributed to \nthe event horizon for historical precedence. But in dynamical cases where the \ntwo horizons are different, $R=2M$ holds for the quasi-local horizon, as we will \nshow.}, but applies for \\emph{all} trapping horizons, whether of dynamical \nblack holes or in cosmology. \nIn collapse, trapping horizons are seen to form in pairs. The two horizons are initially \ncoincident but then separate, one moving inwards and the other moving outwards \n(with respect to the matter). The outward-moving one is often referred to as a \n``dynamical'' or ``apparent'' horizon (further considerations apply here; see \n\\cite{Ashtekar:2004cn}).  \n\nWhen following the geometrical and Misner-Sharp approaches, we use two different \n(but related) quantities for discussing the causal nature of the trapping \nhorizons: with the geometrical approach we use the quantity $\\alpha$, as in \n\\cite{Dreyer:2002mx}, while with the Misner-Sharp approach we use the horizon \nthree velocity $v_H$, measured in the local comoving frame of the fluid. By \ntracking the $R=2M$ condition, we have followed the evolution of $\\alpha$ and \n$v_H$ for each trapping horizon during numerical simulations for collapse of \nidealised stellar models, observing how varying the initial density profiles and \nthe equation of state affects the horizon evolution and its signature. Our \nresults supplement ones from previous work studying pressureless fluid collapse \n\\cite{Booth:2005ng} and a case including angular momentum \n\\cite{Schnetter:2006yt}. As well as presenting results which highlight some \nimportant new features and cast light on aspects of the previous literature, our \nwork also contributes new insights gained by using the parallel geometrical and \nMisner-Sharp approaches.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: in Section \n\\ref{section_trapping_horizon}, we first introduce the fundamentals of the \nMisner-Sharp approach and the concept of trapped surfaces. We then demonstrate \nthe connection between the geometrical and Misner-Sharp formalisms, showing that \nthe condition $R=2M$ applies to both black hole and cosmological trapping \nhorizons. \nIn Section \\ref{section_alpha}, we introduce the definition of the parameters $\\alpha$ and \n$v_H$, explaining how they are related to each other. In Section \n\\ref{section_cosmo}, we apply them to the case of an expanding Universe, \ncommenting on the relation between $\\alpha$ and $v_H$. We then make a similar \nanalysis for the black hole case in Section \\ref{section_black_hole}, studying \nthe behaviour of the ingoing and outgoing horizons in different numerical \ncollapse simulations. Finally in Section \\ref{section_conclusion}, after a brief \nsummary, we present our conclusions and mention some planned future \ndevelopments. Throughout, we use the standard convention of setting $c=G=1$.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Trapping Horizons in the Misner-Sharp approach}\n \\label{section_trapping_horizon}\n \nThe Schwarzschild metric, usually written as \n \n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} ds^2 = - \\left(1-\\frac{2M}{R}\\right) dt^2 + \n\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{R}\\right)^{-1} dR^2 + R^2d\\Omega^2 \\ , \n\\label{Schw-metric} \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"ds^{2}=-\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{R}\\right)dt^{2}+\\left(1-\\frac{2M}{R}\\right)^{-1}dR^{%&#10;2}+R^{2}d\\Omega^{2}\\ ,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mi>R</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mi>R</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05109.tex", "nexttext": "\n This corresponds to an orthogonal comoving foliation of the spacetime, where \n$a$, $b$ and $R$ are positive definite functions of the comoving radial \ncoordinate $r$ and the so-called ``cosmic time'' $t$; $R$ is the circumferential \nradius (the proper circumference of a sphere with coordinate labels $(r,t)$, \ndivided by $2\\pi$), and $d\\Omega$ is the element of a 2-sphere of symmetry. \nThe metric \\eqref{eq_metric_MS} can apply to any spherically symmetric spacetime; in \nthe particular case of a homogeneous and isotropic Universe, which we are also \nconsidering in this paper, it can be rewritten in the form of the FRLW metric.\n\nIn the Misner-Sharp approach, two basic differential operators are introduced\n \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 12771, "prevtext": "\nwhere $d\\Omega^2=d\\theta^2 +\\sin^2(\\theta)d\\varphi^2$ is the element of a 2-sphere.\nThis is the unique static, spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum Einstein \nequations describing the spacetime outside an object having mass $M$ but no \ncharge or angular momentum.

One may then compute the expansion $\\theta$ \nof a null geodesic congruence (\\emph{i.e.} the expansion/contraction of a bundle of \nnull-rays) by Lie-dragging the surface $S$ along one of our two null directions \n(see \\cite{Gourgoulhon:2008pu} for more details and a pictorial explanation). If \nthis expansion $\\theta$ is negative, then the area of the surface $S$ is \nshrinking in the chosen null direction, and the null-rays are converging. Instead if \n$\\theta>0$, the area of $S$ is growing in the direction under consideration, and the \nnull-rays are diverging. In the limiting case of $\\theta=0$, the area of \n$S$ is not varying in the corresponding direction. Our common intuition from Minkowski \nspacetime is that one null direction will have a strictly positive $\\theta$ while the other has a \nstrictly negative $\\theta$, corresponding respectively to the divergence of \noutgoing null-rays and the convergence of ingoing null-rays. In Minkowski spacetime\nwe can have only this type of configuration, where $S$ is known as a ``normal \nsurface''. \n\nHowever there are spacetimes which contain some 2-surfaces for \nwhich both expansions have the same sign: when both are negative, the surface is \nsaid to be ``trapped'' (as occurs inside a black hole); when both are positive, \nthe surface is said to be ``anti-trapped'' (as occurs in an expanding universe). \nThe transition from a normal region where 2-surfaces are of the Minkowski type \nto trapped or anti-trapped regions is characterised by the change of sign of an \nexpansion in one of the two null directions. Let us label this particular null direction \nby the letter $v$ (which stands for ``vanishing'') and the other radial null direction by \n$nv$ (which stands for ``non-vanishing''): $\\theta_v$ can change sign and vanish while \n$\\theta_{nv}$ can never change sign or vanish.

Following the definition introduced by Hayward \\cite{Hayward:1993wb} a \ntrapping horizon is the closure of a three-surface $H$ foliated by marginally \ntrapped surfaces ($\\theta_v=0$) on which $\\theta_{nv} \\neq 0$ and where the Lie \nderivative $\\mathcal{L}_{nv}\\theta_v \\neq 0$ (see Figure \\ref{fig_Schwarzschild} \nfor a more intuitive understanding of the Lie derivative).

In an expanding \n Universe, $U$ is always positive, which means that the Lie derivative is positive for $v_H>-1$, or \n $w>-1$ so that the horizon area $A_H=4\\pi R_H^2$ increases along the horizon trajectory for the \n timelike part of the hyperbola as well as for the outgoing, spacelike part (the upper branch). The \nLie derivative is instead negative for $v_H<-1$, or $w<-1$ so that $A_H$ decreases along the horizon \ntrajectory for the spacelike part of the lower branch. The limit case $v_H=-1$, with vanishing Lie \nderivative, corresponds to a de Sitter universe where indeed $A_H$ does not \nevolve along the horizon trajectory.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this division of the hyperbola into two parts \nwith increasing and decreasing $A_H$ corresponds to the Null Energy Condition \n(NEC), $e+p\\geq0$, being satisfied or not being satisfied, \nrespectively\\footnote{This is consistent with the fact that satisfying the NEC \nis a requirement in order for the Area Theorem to hold.}. On the part where \nit does hold, Eqs.\\eqref{eq_alpha_defi} and \\eqref{alpha} imply a one-to-one \ncorrespondence between spacelike and outer, or timelike and inner. On the part \nwhere it does not hold, the correspondence is reversed. Therefore, reading the \nhyperbola from bottom to top, we get an inner and ingoing horizon which is first \nspacelike (for $w<-1$) then timelike (for $-1<w<-1/3$); then we encounter an \ninner and outgoing horizon (for $-1/3<w<1/3$), and finally an outer and outgoing \nhorizon for the upper branch ($w>1/3$). We note that the combination ``outer and \ningoing'' does not appear on the hyperbola. Bringing together the outer \nrequirement ($\\mathcal{L}_{+}\\theta_-\\propto e-p-1/A_H < 0$) and the ingoing one \n($v_H<0$), we get that $e<1/2A_H$ in this case, which is indeed forbidden by the \nFriedmann Equation Eq.\\eqref{eq_Friedmann} which demands that $e=3/2A_H$. \nTherefore a homogeneous and isotropic Universe cannot have an outer and ingoing \nhorizon, independently of whether the NEC is satisfied or not. Another result is \nthat an outer horizon cannot be timelike. These are examples of the kind of \ninformation which one can extract from the hyperbola, \\emph{i.e.} from the \nsimultaneous study of the geometrical and hydrodynamical aspects of horizons. \nThese considerations will be developed in a future paper. \n\n\n\\section{Black Hole Horizons}\n \\label{section_black_hole}\n In this section, we implement the formalism and notation introduced in previous \nsections for studying the emergence and behaviour of trapping horizons during \ngravitational collapse to form stellar-mass black holes. \nWhile we will be using various simplifications in the treatment \npresented, our eventual interest here is firmly focused on obtaining results \nhaving relevance for realistic astrophysical situations. We are considering here \nonly ``standard matter'' for which $e$ and $p$ are always positive and for which \nthe NEC holds.\n\nWe are restricting attention here to spherically symmetric non-rotating models. \nWhile this is certainly an important restriction (and we note the very \ninteresting related work by Schnetter \\emph{et al.} \\cite{Schnetter:2006yt} including \nrotation) the main features of interest are already present for non-rotating \nmodels. The most important simplifications in our treatment are that we limit \nour matter model to representing an unmagnetized perfect fluid with a polytropic \nequation of state $p=K\\rho^\\gamma$, where $\\rho$ is the rest-mass density and \n$K$ and $\\gamma$ are constants (see Appendix \\ref{Appendix_eqstate}). Note that, \nwhile simplified, this does include pressure effects in a realistic way. There \nhave been important studies related to trapping horizons made in the context of \npressureless matter (often referred to as ``dust''). Some of \nthis work has been extremely interesting (see, for example, Booth \\emph{et al.} \n\\cite{Booth:2005ng}) but pressure effects play an important role in real stellar \ncollapse to form black holes and can seriously change the picture as far as our \npresent considerations are concerned.\n\nHistorically, some basic features of the behaviour of trapping horizons during \ncollapse can already be seen in the paper by May \\& White \\cite{May:1966zz}, \npublished fifty years ago. Their calculations used a similar formulation to that \nof Misner \\& Sharp, (see Appendix \\ref{Appendix_M&S}) and went beyond those in \nthe classic paper by Oppenheimer \\& Snyder \\cite{Oppenheimer:1939ue} by \nincluding non-zero pressure in the collapsing matter. Figure 14 of their paper \n(where $2M/R$ is plotted against their comoving mass coordinate $\\mu$ at a \nsuccession of times during the collapse) shows the peak \nlocal value of $2M/R$ rising to become equal to $1$ and then increasing further, \nleaving two locations where $2M/R = 1$ which then separate, one going outwards \nwith respect to the matter and the other going inwards (\\emph{i.e.} outgoing and \ningoing trapping horizons). We decided that it would be interesting to repeat \ntheir calculations more or less exactly, but adding on the concepts and \nmethodology which we have been presenting here regarding trapping horizons. \nIn this sense, the following discussion can be seen as an addendum to their paper.\n  \nIn a subsequent paper, \\cite{May:1967} they gave a very full account of how \ntheir computations were made, and we followed their methodology with only minor \nmodifications (apart from needing to implement excision, so as to be able to \nfollow the outgoing horizon all the way to the stellar surface). They used a \nstandard type of largely explicit Lagrangian finite-difference method, with the \ncomoving grid consisting of a succession of concentric spherical shells, the \nshell boundaries each being identified with the time-independent value of the \nrest-mass $\\mu$ interior to them (\\emph{i.e.} the comoving radial coordinate $r$ was \nset equal to $\\mu$). They used 200 of these grid-zones, each containing the same \namount of rest-mass $\\Delta\\mu$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=11.0cm,angle=0]{2M_R_53.pdf}    \n   \\caption{$2M/R$ is plotted against $\\mu$ at successive levels of the \ncoordinate time $t$, with the time increasing upwards. This is for a collapse \nstarting from a constant-density initial model with $\\gamma = 5/3$. See text for \nfurther details.}\n    \\label{2m_R}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe 1966 paper deals both with stellar collapses which ``bounce'' and with \ncontinued collapse. We deal with just the latter here, for which they presented \nnumerical results for collapse from rest of a $\\gamma=5/3$, $21 M_\\odot$ \npolytropic sphere of matter having an initially uniform rest-mass density \n($\\rho_0 = 10^7 {\\rm g/cm^3}$) and specific internal energy ($\\epsilon_0/c^2 = \n9.61 \\times 10^{-7}$), corresponding to $K = 0.05$. (The $21 M_\\odot$ refers to \nthe rest-mass of the configuration but, at this initial density, the rest-mass \nis essentially equal to the gravitational mass.) We successfully reproduced \ntheir results with these settings, but for the discussion below we needed a \nhigher resolution and so used 2000 zones rather than 200. Also, we found that we \ncould not get sufficiently clean results with their methodology if we started \nfrom a density as low as $10^7 {\\rm g/cm^3}$ and so we started instead from \n$10^{11} {\\rm g/cm^3}$ but with the same value of $K$. This gave results with \nonly surprisingly minor differences from theirs.\n\nFigure \\ref{2m_R} is our plot of $2M/R$ versus $\\mu$ corresponding to their \nFigure 14 but highlighting the points of interest to us here. \nThe curves represent the solution at successive levels of the coordinate time \n$t$, with the time increasing upwards. (The total coordinate time for our run is \ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than May \\& White's value, because of us \nstarting from a higher density, but this is not relevant for our discussion.) \nFollowing the first (lowest) curve, representing the initial data, the next one \nup shows the moment when the curve first touches the condition $2M/R = 1$ \n(marked by the dashed horizontal line). At later times, there are then two \npoints of intersection of the respective curves with the horizontal line, \nmarking the locations of the ingoing and outgoing trapping horizons which then \nmove apart as time progresses further. Note that these are locations with \nrespect to the {\\it comoving coordinate} $\\mu$.\n\nThere is some tension between standard everyday usage and the terminology of \nHayward \\cite{Hayward:1993wb} regarding trapping horizons. It would be natural \nto refer to the horizons shown in Figure \\ref{2m_R} as being ``inner'' (smaller \nvalue of $\\mu$) and ``outer'' (larger value of $\\mu$) but this would be in \nconflict with Hayward's terminology where both are described as ``outer''. As \nmentioned earlier, in order to avoid confusion, we refer to them just as \n``ingoing'' and ``outgoing'' here.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=7.9cm,angle=0]{e_mu.pdf}    \n  \\includegraphics[width=7.7cm,angle=0]{R_mu.pdf}\n   \\caption{Plots of $e/c^2$ and $R$ against $\\mu$ at successive times for the \nsame case as in Figure \\ref{2m_R}. See text for further details.}\n    \\label{e&R_mu}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn the left frame of Figure \\ref{e&R_mu}, we have similarly plotted the \nenergy density $e$ as $e/c^2$ (in units of ${\\rm g/cm^3}$) against $\\mu$, for \nthe same case as in Figure \\ref{2m_R}. Here the horizontal dashed line marks the \ninitial data, the next curve up is for the time at which the condition $2M/R = \n1$ is first reached, and the successive curves are then for subsequent times \n(time increasing upwards). (May \\& White plotted instead the {\\it rest mass \ndensity} $\\rho$, but it is the energy density which will concern us here.) The \ndots show locations of the {\\it ingoing trapping horizon} and will enter into \nour discussion below (the locations of the outgoing horizon are not shown here \nbecause they get confused among the closely-packed curves in the outer region). \nInitially there is a step discontinuity of the density (and pressure) at the \nsurface of the configuration and this subsequently decays, giving a pressure \ngradient which works its way inwards. For a region where the pressure gradient \nremains zero, the density remains uniform (in this slicing), \\emph{i.e.} $e = e(t)$ \nwith no dependence on $\\mu$. Eventually (after the time of the third solid \ncurve) the uniform region disappears completely and a density cusp appears at \n$\\mu = 0$. Finally, an off-centred density maximum appears \nwhich goes on to form the curvature singularity, as was widely discussed in the \n1960s (see \\cite{Misner:1969br}, for example). The right-hand frame of Figure \n\\ref{e&R_mu} shows a similar plot for $R$ versus $\\mu$ (here time is increasing \ndownwards). Note that at the curvature singularity, $R = 0$ (as expected) but \n$\\mu \\ne 0$ and, indeed, comprises a considerable fraction of the total rest \nmass. However, one needs to be cautious about this because the picture depends \non the slicing used and while $\\mu$ is defined in a clear physical way, the time \ncoordinate $t$ is not, and depends on an arbitrary slicing choice. We are seeing \nhere curves drawn at a succession of constant values of this coordinate $t$.\n\nAt this point, it is relevant to make some general comments (and we apologise to \nreaders for whom this is well-known and obvious). General relativity is fully \nfour-dimensional and reality resides in the full four-dimensional spacetime. It \nis a matter of convenience for us, in making calculations, to split the \nspacetime into 3 dimensions of space plus 1 of time. How this slicing is made is \na matter of choice, and which events appear as simultaneous depends on this \nchoice. Also, whether particular events in the four-dimensional spacetime appear \nor not with the slicing being used, depends on whether it reaches far enough to \n``see'' them. Because an event in the 4D spacetime is not ``seen'' by a given \nslicing does not mean that it does not exist. It \nis fundamental to the idea of a trapping horizon that it is a spacetime concept, \ndefined quasi-locally, which does not depend on the asymptotic behaviour of a \nCauchy slice\\footnote{In this paper, we are dealing only with spherical \nsymmetry and within that context trapping horizons are completely well-defined, \nalthough there may be ambiguities in other contexts.} \\cite{Ashtekar:2004cn, Faraoni:2013aba}. Of the quantities \nwhich we are using here in our discussion, $R$ is a proper circumferential \nradius (proper circumference divided by $2\\pi$), $\\mu$ is a physically-defined \nquantity, $bd\\mu$ and $adt$ are intervals of radial proper distance and proper \ntime, as measured by observers comoving with the fluid, $v_H$ and $\\alpha$ are \ndefined directly in terms of $bd\\mu$ and $adt$, and $e$ and $p$ are measured in \nthe fluid rest frame. It is true that working in the local comoving frame \nrepresents a choice, but comoving observers form a privileged class.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=7.7cm,angle=0]{vh_53_hom_1.pdf}    \n  \\includegraphics[width=7.9cm,angle=0]{vh_53_hom_2.pdf}\n   \\caption{Plots of $|v_H|-1$ (solid curves) and $1/\\alpha$ (dot-dashed curves) \nas functions of $\\mu$; this is for the standard $\\gamma=5/3$ case for collapse \nfrom rest of a $21 M_\\odot$ model with constant-density initial conditions. The \nright-hand frame shows an enlargement of the behaviour at small $\\mu$.}\n    \\label{vh_53_hom}\n\\end{figure}\n\nBearing in mind that Figures \\ref{2m_R} and \\ref{e&R_mu} need to be treated with \nsome caution, we now proceed to discuss the behaviour of the trapping horizons \nusing the quantities listed above. It is, of course, important to use a slicing \nfor our numerical calculations in which the events which we want to study can be \n``seen'', but the diagonal slicing of Misner \\& Sharp and May \\& White does \nsatisfy that. Figure \\ref{vh_53_hom} shows the behaviour of the locally-measured \nhorizon three-velocity $v_H$ and the parameter $\\alpha$ for the outgoing and \ningoing trapping horizons from our standard run as described above (the \nright-hand frame shows an enlargement of the behaviour at small $\\mu$). We have \nplotted the quantities $|v_H| - 1$ (solid curves) and $1/\\alpha$ (dot-dashed \ncurves); each of these is greater than zero if the horizon is spacelike, equal \nto zero if it is null, and less than zero if it is timelike. The behaviour seen \ncan be summarised as follows. The trapping horizons are born as a pair by \nthe separation into two parts of the initial single trapping horizon formed when \nthe $2M/R$ curve becomes tangent to $1$, as seen in Figure \\ref{2m_R}. They \nbegin to separate with infinite velocity, one going outwards with respect to the \nmatter and the other going inwards. At the birth ($|v_H| \\to \\infty$), $\\alpha \n= 1$ and $8\\pi R^2 e = 1$ at the horizon location (\\emph{i.e.} $e = 1/2A_H$ \nthere, where $A_H$ is the area of the horizon - an intriguing result). Both \nhorizons then slow down as they move, the outgoing horizon becoming \nasymptotically null as it approaches the surface of the configuration and \nbecoming a static event horizon when it reaches the vacuum. (Note that $v_H$ is \nalways measured with respect to the local infalling matter; the event horizon is \noutgoing and null with respect to local light cones but is static in that it \nremains at a constant value of $R$.) Meanwhile, $1/\\alpha \\to \\infty$, so that \n$\\alpha \\to 0$ at the surface, as expected. As the ingoing horizon slows down, \nit becomes timelike for a while before becoming spacelike again and eventually \ngoing back to the conditions ($|v_H| \\to \\infty$, $\\alpha = 1$) which it had at \nbirth. Comparing this with Figure \\ref{e&R_mu}, note that the pair of horizons \nfirst forms at a value of $\\mu$ outward of that for the singularity and that the \nuniform-density region is reached by the ingoing horizon while it is timelike. \nThe rise of $|v_H|$ back towards infinity happens when the ingoing horizon \nencounters the rising part of the profile for $e$, leading towards the cusp at \n$\\mu = 0$. All of the latter parts of this happen at values of $\\mu$ smaller \nthan that at which the singularity forms.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \n \\centering  \n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,angle=0]{2MR_OS.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=6.5cm,angle=0]{Penrose_OS.pdf}    \n   \\caption{Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse.

In an expanding \n Universe, $U$ is always positive, which means that the Lie derivative is positive for $v_H>-1$, or \n $w>-1$ so that the horizon area $A_H=4\\pi R_H^2$ increases along the horizon trajectory for the \n timelike part of the hyperbola as well as for the outgoing, spacelike part (the upper branch). The \nLie derivative is instead negative for $v_H<-1$, or $w<-1$ so that $A_H$ decreases along the horizon \ntrajectory for the spacelike part of the lower branch. The limit case $v_H=-1$, with vanishing Lie \nderivative, corresponds to a de Sitter universe where indeed $A_H$ does not \nevolve along the horizon trajectory.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this division of the hyperbola into two parts \nwith increasing and decreasing $A_H$ corresponds to the Null Energy Condition \n(NEC), $e+p\\geq0$, being satisfied or not being satisfied, \nrespectively\\footnote{This is consistent with the fact that satisfying the NEC \nis a requirement in order for the Area Theorem to hold.}. On the part where \nit does hold, Eqs.\\eqref{eq_alpha_defi} and \\eqref{alpha} imply a one-to-one \ncorrespondence between spacelike and outer, or timelike and inner. On the part \nwhere it does not hold, the correspondence is reversed. Therefore, reading the \nhyperbola from bottom to top, we get an inner and ingoing horizon which is first \nspacelike (for $w<-1$) then timelike (for $-1<w<-1/3$); then we encounter an \ninner and outgoing horizon (for $-1/3<w<1/3$), and finally an outer and outgoing \nhorizon for the upper branch ($w>1/3$). We note that the combination ``outer and \ningoing'' does not appear on the hyperbola. Bringing together the outer \nrequirement ($\\mathcal{L}_{+}\\theta_-\\propto e-p-1/A_H < 0$) and the ingoing one \n($v_H<0$), we get that $e<1/2A_H$ in this case, which is indeed forbidden by the \nFriedmann Equation Eq.\\eqref{eq_Friedmann} which demands that $e=3/2A_H$. \nTherefore a homogeneous and isotropic Universe cannot have an outer and ingoing \nhorizon, independently of whether the NEC is satisfied or not. Another result is \nthat an outer horizon cannot be timelike. These are examples of the kind of \ninformation which one can extract from the hyperbola, \\emph{i.e.} from the \nsimultaneous study of the geometrical and hydrodynamical aspects of horizons. \nThese considerations will be developed in a future paper. \n\n\n\\section{Black Hole Horizons}\n \\label{section_black_hole}\n In this section, we implement the formalism and notation introduced in previous \nsections for studying the emergence and behaviour of trapping horizons during \ngravitational collapse to form stellar-mass black holes. \nWhile we will be using various simplifications in the treatment \npresented, our eventual interest here is firmly focused on obtaining results \nhaving relevance for realistic astrophysical situations. We are considering here \nonly ``standard matter'' for which $e$ and $p$ are always positive and for which \nthe NEC holds.\n\nWe are restricting attention here to spherically symmetric non-rotating models. \nWhile this is certainly an important restriction (and we note the very \ninteresting related work by Schnetter \\emph{et al.} \\cite{Schnetter:2006yt} including \nrotation) the main features of interest are already present for non-rotating \nmodels. The most important simplifications in our treatment are that we limit \nour matter model to representing an unmagnetized perfect fluid with a polytropic \nequation of state $p=K\\rho^\\gamma$, where $\\rho$ is the rest-mass density and \n$K$ and $\\gamma$ are constants (see Appendix \\ref{Appendix_eqstate}). Note that, \nwhile simplified, this does include pressure effects in a realistic way. There \nhave been important studies related to trapping horizons made in the context of \npressureless matter (often referred to as ``dust''). Some of \nthis work has been extremely interesting (see, for example, Booth \\emph{et al.} \n\\cite{Booth:2005ng}) but pressure effects play an important role in real stellar \ncollapse to form black holes and can seriously change the picture as far as our \npresent considerations are concerned.\n\nHistorically, some basic features of the behaviour of trapping horizons during \ncollapse can already be seen in the paper by May \\& White \\cite{May:1966zz}, \npublished fifty years ago. Their calculations used a similar formulation to that \nof Misner \\& Sharp, (see Appendix \\ref{Appendix_M&S}) and went beyond those in \nthe classic paper by Oppenheimer \\& Snyder \\cite{Oppenheimer:1939ue} by \nincluding non-zero pressure in the collapsing matter. Figure 14 of their paper \n(where $2M/R$ is plotted against their comoving mass coordinate $\\mu$ at a \nsuccession of times during the collapse) shows the peak \nlocal value of $2M/R$ rising to become equal to $1$ and then increasing further, \nleaving two locations where $2M/R = 1$ which then separate, one going outwards \nwith respect to the matter and the other going inwards (\\emph{i.e.} outgoing and \ningoing trapping horizons). We decided that it would be interesting to repeat \ntheir calculations more or less exactly, but adding on the concepts and \nmethodology which we have been presenting here regarding trapping horizons. \nIn this sense, the following discussion can be seen as an addendum to their paper.\n  \nIn a subsequent paper, \\cite{May:1967} they gave a very full account of how \ntheir computations were made, and we followed their methodology with only minor \nmodifications (apart from needing to implement excision, so as to be able to \nfollow the outgoing horizon all the way to the stellar surface). They used a \nstandard type of largely explicit Lagrangian finite-difference method, with the \ncomoving grid consisting of a succession of concentric spherical shells, the \nshell boundaries each being identified with the time-independent value of the \nrest-mass $\\mu$ interior to them (\\emph{i.e.} the comoving radial coordinate $r$ was \nset equal to $\\mu$). They used 200 of these grid-zones, each containing the same \namount of rest-mass $\\Delta\\mu$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=11.0cm,angle=0]{2M_R_53.pdf}    \n   \\caption{$2M/R$ is plotted against $\\mu$ at successive levels of the \ncoordinate time $t$, with the time increasing upwards. This is for a collapse \nstarting from a constant-density initial model with $\\gamma = 5/3$. See text for \nfurther details.}\n    \\label{2m_R}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe 1966 paper deals both with stellar collapses which ``bounce'' and with \ncontinued collapse. We deal with just the latter here, for which they presented \nnumerical results for collapse from rest of a $\\gamma=5/3$, $21 M_\\odot$ \npolytropic sphere of matter having an initially uniform rest-mass density \n($\\rho_0 = 10^7 {\\rm g/cm^3}$) and specific internal energy ($\\epsilon_0/c^2 = \n9.61 \\times 10^{-7}$), corresponding to $K = 0.05$. (The $21 M_\\odot$ refers to \nthe rest-mass of the configuration but, at this initial density, the rest-mass \nis essentially equal to the gravitational mass.) We successfully reproduced \ntheir results with these settings, but for the discussion below we needed a \nhigher resolution and so used 2000 zones rather than 200. Also, we found that we \ncould not get sufficiently clean results with their methodology if we started \nfrom a density as low as $10^7 {\\rm g/cm^3}$ and so we started instead from \n$10^{11} {\\rm g/cm^3}$ but with the same value of $K$. This gave results with \nonly surprisingly minor differences from theirs.\n\nFigure \\ref{2m_R} is our plot of $2M/R$ versus $\\mu$ corresponding to their \nFigure 14 but highlighting the points of interest to us here. \nThe curves represent the solution at successive levels of the coordinate time \n$t$, with the time increasing upwards. (The total coordinate time for our run is \ntwo orders of magnitude smaller than May \\& White's value, because of us \nstarting from a higher density, but this is not relevant for our discussion.) \nFollowing the first (lowest) curve, representing the initial data, the next one \nup shows the moment when the curve first touches the condition $2M/R = 1$ \n(marked by the dashed horizontal line). At later times, there are then two \npoints of intersection of the respective curves with the horizontal line, \nmarking the locations of the ingoing and outgoing trapping horizons which then \nmove apart as time progresses further. Note that these are locations with \nrespect to the {\\it comoving coordinate} $\\mu$.\n\nThere is some tension between standard everyday usage and the terminology of \nHayward \\cite{Hayward:1993wb} regarding trapping horizons. It would be natural \nto refer to the horizons shown in Figure \\ref{2m_R} as being ``inner'' (smaller \nvalue of $\\mu$) and ``outer'' (larger value of $\\mu$) but this would be in \nconflict with Hayward's terminology where both are described as ``outer''. As \nmentioned earlier, in order to avoid confusion, we refer to them just as \n``ingoing'' and ``outgoing'' here.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=7.9cm,angle=0]{e_mu.pdf}    \n  \\includegraphics[width=7.7cm,angle=0]{R_mu.pdf}\n   \\caption{Plots of $e/c^2$ and $R$ against $\\mu$ at successive times for the \nsame case as in Figure \\ref{2m_R}. See text for further details.}\n    \\label{e&R_mu}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn the left frame of Figure \\ref{e&R_mu}, we have similarly plotted the \nenergy density $e$ as $e/c^2$ (in units of ${\\rm g/cm^3}$) against $\\mu$, for \nthe same case as in Figure \\ref{2m_R}. Here the horizontal dashed line marks the \ninitial data, the next curve up is for the time at which the condition $2M/R = \n1$ is first reached, and the successive curves are then for subsequent times \n(time increasing upwards). (May \\& White plotted instead the {\\it rest mass \ndensity} $\\rho$, but it is the energy density which will concern us here.) The \ndots show locations of the {\\it ingoing trapping horizon} and will enter into \nour discussion below (the locations of the outgoing horizon are not shown here \nbecause they get confused among the closely-packed curves in the outer region). \nInitially there is a step discontinuity of the density (and pressure) at the \nsurface of the configuration and this subsequently decays, giving a pressure \ngradient which works its way inwards. For a region where the pressure gradient \nremains zero, the density remains uniform (in this slicing), \\emph{i.e.} $e = e(t)$ \nwith no dependence on $\\mu$. Eventually (after the time of the third solid \ncurve) the uniform region disappears completely and a density cusp appears at \n$\\mu = 0$. Finally, an off-centred density maximum appears \nwhich goes on to form the curvature singularity, as was widely discussed in the \n1960s (see \\cite{Misner:1969br}, for example). The right-hand frame of Figure \n\\ref{e&R_mu} shows a similar plot for $R$ versus $\\mu$ (here time is increasing \ndownwards). Note that at the curvature singularity, $R = 0$ (as expected) but \n$\\mu \\ne 0$ and, indeed, comprises a considerable fraction of the total rest \nmass. However, one needs to be cautious about this because the picture depends \non the slicing used and while $\\mu$ is defined in a clear physical way, the time \ncoordinate $t$ is not, and depends on an arbitrary slicing choice. We are seeing \nhere curves drawn at a succession of constant values of this coordinate $t$.\n\nAt this point, it is relevant to make some general comments (and we apologise to \nreaders for whom this is well-known and obvious). General relativity is fully \nfour-dimensional and reality resides in the full four-dimensional spacetime. It \nis a matter of convenience for us, in making calculations, to split the \nspacetime into 3 dimensions of space plus 1 of time. How this slicing is made is \na matter of choice, and which events appear as simultaneous depends on this \nchoice. Also, whether particular events in the four-dimensional spacetime appear \nor not with the slicing being used, depends on whether it reaches far enough to \n``see'' them. Because an event in the 4D spacetime is not ``seen'' by a given \nslicing does not mean that it does not exist. It \nis fundamental to the idea of a trapping horizon that it is a spacetime concept, \ndefined quasi-locally, which does not depend on the asymptotic behaviour of a \nCauchy slice\\footnote{In this paper, we are dealing only with spherical \nsymmetry and within that context trapping horizons are completely well-defined, \nalthough there may be ambiguities in other contexts.} \\cite{Ashtekar:2004cn, Faraoni:2013aba}. Of the quantities \nwhich we are using here in our discussion, $R$ is a proper circumferential \nradius (proper circumference divided by $2\\pi$), $\\mu$ is a physically-defined \nquantity, $bd\\mu$ and $adt$ are intervals of radial proper distance and proper \ntime, as measured by observers comoving with the fluid, $v_H$ and $\\alpha$ are \ndefined directly in terms of $bd\\mu$ and $adt$, and $e$ and $p$ are measured in \nthe fluid rest frame. It is true that working in the local comoving frame \nrepresents a choice, but comoving observers form a privileged class.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=7.7cm,angle=0]{vh_53_hom_1.pdf}    \n  \\includegraphics[width=7.9cm,angle=0]{vh_53_hom_2.pdf}\n   \\caption{Plots of $|v_H|-1$ (solid curves) and $1/\\alpha$ (dot-dashed curves) \nas functions of $\\mu$; this is for the standard $\\gamma=5/3$ case for collapse \nfrom rest of a $21 M_\\odot$ model with constant-density initial conditions. The \nright-hand frame shows an enlargement of the behaviour at small $\\mu$.}\n    \\label{vh_53_hom}\n\\end{figure}\n\nBearing in mind that Figures \\ref{2m_R} and \\ref{e&R_mu} need to be treated with \nsome caution, we now proceed to discuss the behaviour of the trapping horizons \nusing the quantities listed above. It is, of course, important to use a slicing \nfor our numerical calculations in which the events which we want to study can be \n``seen'', but the diagonal slicing of Misner \\& Sharp and May \\& White does \nsatisfy that. Figure \\ref{vh_53_hom} shows the behaviour of the locally-measured \nhorizon three-velocity $v_H$ and the parameter $\\alpha$ for the outgoing and \ningoing trapping horizons from our standard run as described above (the \nright-hand frame shows an enlargement of the behaviour at small $\\mu$). We have \nplotted the quantities $|v_H| - 1$ (solid curves) and $1/\\alpha$ (dot-dashed \ncurves); each of these is greater than zero if the horizon is spacelike, equal \nto zero if it is null, and less than zero if it is timelike. The behaviour seen \ncan be summarised as follows. The trapping horizons are born as a pair by \nthe separation into two parts of the initial single trapping horizon formed when \nthe $2M/R$ curve becomes tangent to $1$, as seen in Figure \\ref{2m_R}. They \nbegin to separate with infinite velocity, one going outwards with respect to the \nmatter and the other going inwards. At the birth ($|v_H| \\to \\infty$), $\\alpha \n= 1$ and $8\\pi R^2 e = 1$ at the horizon location (\\emph{i.e.} $e = 1/2A_H$ \nthere, where $A_H$ is the area of the horizon - an intriguing result). Both \nhorizons then slow down as they move, the outgoing horizon becoming \nasymptotically null as it approaches the surface of the configuration and \nbecoming a static event horizon when it reaches the vacuum. (Note that $v_H$ is \nalways measured with respect to the local infalling matter; the event horizon is \noutgoing and null with respect to local light cones but is static in that it \nremains at a constant value of $R$.) Meanwhile, $1/\\alpha \\to \\infty$, so that \n$\\alpha \\to 0$ at the surface, as expected. As the ingoing horizon slows down, \nit becomes timelike for a while before becoming spacelike again and eventually \ngoing back to the conditions ($|v_H| \\to \\infty$, $\\alpha = 1$) which it had at \nbirth. Comparing this with Figure \\ref{e&R_mu}, note that the pair of horizons \nfirst forms at a value of $\\mu$ outward of that for the singularity and that the \nuniform-density region is reached by the ingoing horizon while it is timelike. \nThe rise of $|v_H|$ back towards infinity happens when the ingoing horizon \nencounters the rising part of the profile for $e$, leading towards the cusp at \n$\\mu = 0$. All of the latter parts of this happen at values of $\\mu$ smaller \nthan that at which the singularity forms.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \n \\centering  \n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,angle=0]{2MR_OS.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=6.5cm,angle=0]{Penrose_OS.pdf}    \n   \\caption{Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse.

This is in contrast to the \nsituation for the results of our simulations with non-zero pressure, where the \ningoing and outgoing horizons are born within the matter configuration and \nseparate with initially infinite $v_H$, giving a smooth join between them at the \npoint of birth. Another special feature of the Oppenheimer-Snyder solution is \nthe one-to-one correspondence here between outgoing/ingoing horizons and \nouter/inner horizons in the Hayward terminology. This, again, does not arise for \nour simulations with non-zero pressure.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=7.9cm,angle=0]{vh_43_hom_1.pdf}    \n  \\includegraphics[width=7.8cm,angle=0]{vh_43_hom_2.pdf}\n   \\caption{Equivalent plots to those in Figure \\ref{vh_53_hom}, but this time \nwith $\\gamma=4/3$ rather than $5/3$.

For our first alternative model, we \nreplaced $\\gamma = 5/3$ by $\\gamma = 4/3$, but kept everything else the same, \nincluding the initial value of $p/\\rho$ (checking that this still ensured \ncontinuing collapse rather than a collapse and bounce). We chose $\\gamma = 4/3$ \n(corresponding to a relativistic particle gas) because in the limit where the \ninternal energy becomes very much larger than the rest-mass energy, this tends \ntowards a $p=we$ equation of state with $w = 1/3$, as used for cosmological \ncalculations in the radiative era of the early universe. The internal energy \nbecomes progressively larger with respect to the rest-mass energy as the \ncollapse proceeds but, in our calculation, it never quite reached the asymptotic \nregime. Our results are shown in Figure \\ref{vh_43_hom}. The most important \ndifference seen is the long horizontal part of the curves for $|v_H| - 1$ and \n$1/\\alpha$ when the ingoing horizon is timelike. The reason for this can be \nunderstood by looking again at Figure \\ref{e&R_mu} (for $\\gamma=5/3$). The \nhorizontal regions of uniform energy density are longer in the $\\gamma = 4/3$ \ncase, so that the ingoing horizon is traversing spatially uniform matter for \nlonger, meaning that there is a substantial part of the evolution which is \nsimilar to the Oppenheimer-Snyder solution ($p/e$ is quite small there). \nIn contrast, for the $\\gamma = 5/3$ case the ingoing horizon \nonly reached the uniform density region just before that disappeared.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=7.9cm,angle=0]{vh_53_tov_1.pdf}    \n  \\includegraphics[width=7.8cm,angle=0]{vh_53_tov_2.pdf}\n   \\caption{Equivalent plots to those in Figure \\ref{vh_53_hom}, using a \n$\\gamma=5/3$ equation of state but starting from a $21 M_\\odot$ model in \nhydrostatic equilibrium, which was then destabilized by decreasing $K$.

This means that the ingoing horizon must \ndisappear before reaching $\\mu=0$, which in the numerical simulations means that \nit has to disappear on reaching the outer edge of the innermost grid zone. \nBecause of the finite numerical resolution, the innermost zone has a finite \nwidth, and we see the ingoing horizon disappearing before the formation of the \nsingularity, in the slicing being used. However, from geometrical consistency it \nshould approach the centre of symmetry at $\\mu=0$ asymptotically; with an \ninfinite precision one would see it getting closer and closer to $\\mu=0$ until \nthe formation of the singularity at a finite value of $\\mu$.

If the NEC is violated, with the \npressure becoming negative, the outgoing horizon is allowed to roll down the \nupper branch of the hyperbola beyond $v_H=1$, becoming timelike with a \ndecreasing $A_H$, signifying a shrinking surface. This happens in the presence \nof Hawking radiation, consistently with the fact that a timelike outgoing \nhorizon ($0<v_H<1$), allows emission to go through the horizon \n\\cite{Ellis:2013oka, Firouzjaee:2014zfa}. Note also the consistency of the \nhorizon still being outgoing in the presence of Hawking radiation, remembering \nthat $v_H$ is measured with respect to the collapsing matter.\n\nIn Section \\ref{section_cosmo}, we saw that our working hypothesis (homogeneity \nand isotropy) excluded one conceivable horizon configuration. In our black hole \nsimulations, we considered only classical matter ($e$ and $p$ positive) which \nalso excludes one configuration, \\emph{i.e.} the inner and outgoing horizon. Indeed, \nthe latter simultaneously has $\\mathcal{L}_{-}\\theta_+\\propto [(e-p)-1/A_H] > 0$ because \nit is inner, and $v_H>0$ because it is outgoing, and therefore from Eq.\\eqref{eq_vH_BH} \nwe must have $p<-1/2A_H<0$. Hence for a classical fluid the outgoing horizon can only be \nouter. Whenever the NEC is satisfied (as it is for a classical fluid) there is a \nstrict one-to-one correspondence, spacelike = outer and timelike = inner. Since \nthe outgoing horizon can only be outer for classical matter, it must therefore \nbe spacelike whereas the ingoing horizon can sometimes be spacelike (outer) and \nsometimes timelike (inner). Having this classically excluded configuration \n(inner and outgoing) seems to confirm the possibility of using the relation \nbetween $\\alpha$ and $v_H$ also within the context of quantum effects (such as \nHawking evaporation, mentioned before) which indeed allow violation of the \nenergy conditions.\n\nAnother special point on the hyperbola plotted in Figure \n\\ref{fig_BH(alpha-v_H)}, is where $\\alpha=-1$ and $v_H=0$, corresponding to the \ngeometrical relation $p=-1/2A_H$, which for a homogeneous and isotropic fluid \ncorresponds to $(e+3p)=0$ (see the hyperbola for the cosmological trapping \nhorizon in Figure \\ref{fig_CH(alpha-v_H)}). In this case the value of $A_H$ is \nindependent of the energy density and depends only on the pressure, a symmetric \nrelation to the one at the point of horizon formation ($\\alpha=1$ and \n$v_H=\\pm\\infty$, with $e=1/2A_H$ independently of the value of the pressure). \nThis point of the hyperbola represents the situation for a horizon which is \nneither outgoing nor ingoing, but is instead comoving with the collapsing \nmatter. Rolling down the hyperbola, an outgoing horizon passing through this \npoint would then become ingoing, while an ingoing horizon rolling up along the \nhyperbola would instead become outgoing. This corresponds to a turnaround of the \nhorizon with respect to the matter. If an ingoing horizon becomes outgoing with \na turnaround and keeps rolling up to $v_H=1$ and $\\alpha=0$, then from \nEq.\\eqref{eq_areal_velocity_BH} $A_H$ will start increasing, and the horizon bounces. \nSuch a bounce has been proposed as an alternative to the classical result of black hole singularity \nformation \\cite{Frolov:1979, Roman:1983zza, Hajicek:1986hj, Hayward:2005gi, Ashtekar:2005cj, Frolov:2014jva, Rovelli:2014cta}. Although these scenarios are quite speculative, and we \nare not trying to draw any conclusion regarding them here, we think that it is \nworth pointing out that they could in principle be included within this sort of \ndiscussion of $\\alpha$ and $v_H$. In future, we plan to investigate some of \nthese possibilities using an equation of state including quantum phenomenology \nwhich allows for violation of the energy conditions.\n\n\n\\section{Summary and Conclusions}\n\\label{section_conclusion}\n In the present paper, we have brought together the Misner-Sharp hydrodynamical \nformalism and the geometrical formalism normally used for discussing trapping \nhorizons.  We have given our motivations and explained why \nquasi-local horizons are useful in dynamical situations such as collapse to form \nblack holes. By relating the expansion of the null geodesic congruence $\\theta$ \nto the hydrodynamical parameters $U$ and $\\Gamma$, we have confirmed that the \nhorizons which appear in the \nMisner-Sharp formalism are precisely trapping horizons (we have used this term for 3D \nhypersurfaces as well as 2D surfaces here): loci where $U\\pm\\Gamma$ \nvanishes or equivalently where $\\theta_{\\pm}=0$, corresponding to $R=2M$. This \ncondition holds more generally than just for the event horizon of the \nSchwarzschild metric, and is valid for both black hole and cosmological trapping \nhorizons.\n\nWe then used this unified framework to study trapping horizons, singling out two \nparameters, the geometrical $\\alpha$ (the sign of which gives the causal nature \nof the horizon), and the hydrodynamical $v_H$, which is the three velocity of \nthe horizon with respect to the collapsing/expanding fluid. For a perfect fluid \nmedium, each can be expressed as a simple algebraic function of the energy \ndensity and pressure of the fluid at the location of the horizon, and they can \nalso be expressed as simple functions of each other, represented by a \nrectangular hyperbola. We found that the simultaneous study of these two \nparameters is very interesting and useful, and that the horizon evolution can be \nconveniently represented using the hyperbola.\n\nWe applied our combined formalism to the case of a homogeneous and isotropic \nUniverse with equation of state $p=we$, finding that this gave us a clear \nunderstanding of the reason why the cosmological trapping horizon (often \nreferred to as the cosmological apparent horizon) does not coincide with the \nHubble Sphere. As far as we know, the physical interpretation of this difference \nhad never previously been clarified in the literature. Consistently with what \nwas already known about the cosmological trapping horizon, we found that \n$\\alpha$ and $v_H$ depend only on the parameter $w$ of the equation of state: \neach value of $w$ is mapped to a corresponding point on the hyperbola.\n\nIn the context of black hole formation, we made numerical simulations of \nspherically symmetric stellar collapse similar to what had been done in 1966 by \nMay \\& White \\cite{May:1966zz} but focusing now on the behaviour of the trapping \nhorizons. Following the line of the previous work, we investigated three sample \ncases, all including pressure effects using a polytropic equation of state. Two \nstarted from constant density but with different values of the polytropic index \n$\\gamma$ ($5/3$ and $4/3$), while the third, more realistic, case started from a \nconfiguration in hydrostatic equilibrium which was then made unstable to \ncollapse by reducing the parameter $K$. We note that, in many \nrespects, our results are rather different from those given by the analytic \nOppenheimer-Snyder solution \\cite{Oppenheimer:1939ue} for pressureless collapse \nfrom constant-density initial conditions, which has limitations in representing \nrealistic situations.\n\nOur simulations all show the formation of a trapping horizon within the \ncollapsing matter with $\\alpha=1$ which then separates into two parts, one \nmoving outwards ($v_H>0$) and the other moving inwards ($v_H<0$). Both of these \nhorizons form spacelike with $v_H \\to \\pm \\infty$. For any classical fluid not violating the NEC, it is known that the \noutgoing horizon (which is an outer horizon according to Hayward's terminology) \nmust remain spacelike while passing through the collapsing matter and this is \nindeed seen in the simulations with the horizon eventually becoming null when \nall of the collapsing matter has passed through it. At the final stage, it is an \nisolated horizon in vacuum, equivalent to the event horizon of the Schwarzschild \nsolution. For the two cases starting from constant density, the ingoing horizon \nstarts spacelike, subsequently becomes timelike, and then goes back to being \nspacelike again at the end; for the case starting from hydrostatic equilibrium, \nit always remains spacelike. In all cases, the ingoing horizon continues to move \ntowards $\\mu=0$ (which is not a singular point), finally disappearing there with \n$\\alpha \\to 1$ and $v_H \\to -\\infty$, the same conditions as when it was formed. \nThe overall behaviour can be usefully represented on a hyperbola plot, as \nbefore, leading to additional insights. The roles of differing initial \nconfigurations and differing equations of state require further investigation \nwith a more systematic analysis, and we are now embarking on that.\n\n\\vspace{1cm}\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n In the process of preparing this paper, we have benefited from  \ndiscussions with a number of colleagues; in particular, we are very grateful to \nGeorge Ellis, Valerio Faraoni, Javadh \\mbox{Firouzjaee}, Stefano Liberati, Pierre Bin\\'{e}truy, \nFr\\'{e}d\\'{e}ric Lamy, Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto, Pier \\mbox{Stefano} Corasaniti, \\'{E}ric Gourgoulhon. \nJohn Miller and Ilia Musco thank the PCCP group of APC for hosting them during the course of the collaboration.

All of the dynamical behaviour of the horizons seen in \nthe simulations can then be represented by thinking of them moving along the \nbranches of the hyperbola. In each of the cases which we have studied here, \na single trapping horizon appears at $\\alpha=1$, and it then separates into a pair of horizons, one outgoing and one ingoing, \nwith $v_H\\to\\pm\\infty$ and with the local value of the energy density being \n$e=1/2A_H$, independently of the pressure. The outgoing horizon, which is \nalways spacelike, starts at the top of the upper branch of the hyperbola and \nthen rolls \ndown it, eventually reaching the stationary state corresponding to a null \nisolated horizon with $v_H=1$ when all of the collapsing matter has passed \nthrough it, so that $(e+p)=0$ at the horizon location. The ingoing horizon is \nalso initially spacelike but starts at the bottom of the \\emph{lower} branch of \nthe hyperbola, and then rolls up it, possibly passing to the upper branch (the \ntwo branches are connected via $\\alpha\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty$) where it comes in \nfrom the left as a \\emph{timelike} horizon and continues to roll upwards. \nWhether it passes to the upper branch or not, it eventually reaches a maximum \nheight on the plot and then rolls down the hyperbola again, ending on the lower \nbranch, going back to $v_H \\to - \\infty$ and $\\alpha=1$ from where it started. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t!] \n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=15.0cm,angle=0]{BH_hyperbola.pdf}    \n   \\caption{Plot of $v_H$ versus $\\alpha$ for the black hole horizons.
