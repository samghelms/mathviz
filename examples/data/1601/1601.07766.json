On the contrary,\nlimited attention has been paid to the revaluation of an unconditioned\nstimulus (UCS), which, as experimentally observed by various researchers\nin the last four decades, occurs out of classical conditioning. For\nthis reason, no analytical or quantitative theory has been developed\nfor this phenomenon and its dynamics. Unluckily, models based on classical\nconditioning are unable to explain or predict important psychophysiological\nphenomena, such as the failure of the extinction of emotional responses\nin certain circumstances. In this manuscript an analytical representation\nof UCS revaluation learning is developed; this allows us to identify\nthe conditions determining the \\textquotedblleft inextinguishability\\textquotedblright{}\n(or resistant-to-extinction) property of emotional responses and reactions\n(such as those observed in evaluative conditioning, in the nonreinforcement\npresentation of a conditioned inhibitor, in post-traumatic stress\ndisorders and in panic attacks). Furthermore, an analysis of the causal\nrelation existing between classical conditioning and UCS revaluation\nis provided. Starting from this result, a theory of implicit emotional\nlearning and a novel interpretation of classical conditioning are\nderived.

In fact, emotions prepare any organism to\nact in some specific ways without the need of experiencing a physical\neffect that originates from a specific source of stimulation; for\ninstance, the perception of a snake evokes an innate reaction \\cite{Flykt2007,Ohman1993,Ohman1993b}\nbefore experiencing (or re-experiencing) a physical elicitation (e.g.,\na snake attack). This is due to the fact that the representation of\nsome stimuli and the associated emotional reactions are innate \\cite{Flykt2007,Ohman1993,Ohman1993b},\nbeing shaped by evolution.\n\nThe emotional system plays also an important role in many psychiatric\nand psychological diseases, in decision making \\cite{Damasio1996}\nand in the clinical field (e.g., in drug treatment; \\cite{Benedetti2008,Enck2008,Petrovic2002,Watson2009,Weimer2015}).\nMoreover, experimental evidence suggests that subliminal emotional\nstimulation (through emotional pictures) can improve sport or endurance\nperformance \\cite{Blanchfield2014,Radel2009}, and that emotions influence\npain perception \\cite{Roy2009,Wagener2009,Wiech2009}. This leads\nto the conclusion that any influence at emotional level may substantially\naffect human behavior and perception. \n\nNowadays, the experimental study of emotions and of their related\nphenomena is usually based on \\emph{classical conditioning paradigms}\n\\cite{Pavlov1927}. Classical conditioning occurs when a \\emph{conditioned\nstimulus} (CS) is paired with an \\emph{unconditioned stimulus} (UCS).\nGenerally speaking, a CS is a neutral/innocuous stimulus (e.g., a\nsound or a neutral visual cue), whereas the associated UCS is a source\nof stimulation (e.g., an electric shock or food). By repeated CS-UCS\npairings, a CS can come to elicit a \\emph{conditioned response} (CR),\nwhich is often similar to the \\emph{unconditioned response} (UCR),\ni.e. to the response directly elicited by the paired UCS \\cite{Fanselow2005,Kim2006,Pavlov1927};\nhowever, the repetitive presentation of the CS without that of the\npaired UCS leads to CR \\emph{extinction}, since the CS itself will\nnot be longer able to signal (or predict) the UCS.\n\nClassical conditioning theory provides an explanation of the emotional\nlearning mechanism involved in repeated CS-UCS pairings. However,\nthis is not the only emotional learning mechanism, as originally understood\nby \\cite{Rescorla1974}. In fact, Rescorla noticed the difference\nbetween the learning mechanisms involving two independent emotional\nmemories, one concerning CS-UCS pairing, the other one the UCS outcome\nevaluation (and re-evaluation). This viewpoint has been shared by\nother researchers (e.g., see \\cite{Davey1989,Gottfried2004,Hosoba2001,Schultz2013}).\nHowever, as far as we know, until now no mathematical (or quantitative)\nmodel has been developed for the second type of emotional learning,\ni.e. for \\emph{UCS revaluation} (in other words, for the learning\nand the re-valuation of an UCS outcome). For this reason, no quantitative\ndescription can be given for many psychophysiological effects and\nphenomena driven by the emotional system. In fact, this requires the\nknowledge of a model able to porperly describe the dynamics of the\ninteractions between the emotional system and a primary stimulus (i.e.,\nan UCS). \n\nIn this manuscript we tackle the problems of developing a novel theory\nand a new model for implicit emotional learning; we also lay foundations\nfor the development of new methods for the modulation of emotional\nreactive responses. Our solutions to the above mentioned problems\nare based on the analysis and the interpretation of various experimental\nresults acquired in different disciplines. In fact, we propose a unifying\nframework that provides a comprehensive and coherent description of\nthe emotional learning system. \n\nThe article begins by illustrating a multidimensional representation\nof the emotional response to a given stimulus. The proposed representation,\nwhich is supported by experimental evidence showing the involvement\nof distinct and specific neuronal populations in emotional responses\n\\cite{Schultz2000,Schultz2006} (and is also supported by other experimental\nresults based on pharmacological conditioning \\cite{Amanzio1999,Guo2010,Haour2005}),\naccounts for the different types of emotional response and, in particular,\nfor \\emph{active responses} (which are actively sustained by external\nphysical mechanisms, like pharmacological or mechanical stimulation),\n\\emph{reactive responses} (which are not sustained by any physical\nmechanism, but ``self-instantiated'' by the emotional system) and\n\\emph{passive residual responses} (due to the excitatory residuals\nfrom previous emotional elicitations; \\cite{Zillmann1971,Zillmann1972}).\nMoreover, in our representation plays an important role the \\emph{source\nattribution and misattribution} phenomena \\cite{Anderson1989,Bryant2003a,Cotton1981,Jones2009,Uleman1987}\nand the modeling of \\emph{contrast effects} \\cite{flaherty1982}.\nWe then develop a novel model describing the emotional response of\nan organism elicited by a source of stimulation (i.e., an UCS). The\nderivation of our model relies on the assumption that, similarly as\nvarious mathematical models describing classical conditioning (e.g.,\nRescorla-Wagner model \\cite{Miller1995,Rescorla1972} or \\emph{temporal\ndifference }(TD)\\emph{ models} \\cite{Doherty2003,Schultz1997,Sutton1988,Sutton1990}),\nor probabilistic (Bayesian) ``perception'' and ``action'' learning\nmodels (i.e., the \\emph{predictive coding }(PC) \\cite{Friston2008}\nand the \\emph{active inference models} \\cite{friston2009,friston2010}),\ncoding of emotional and behavioral responses involves the computation\nof a specific \\emph{error-signal}. In our work this error signal is\ndefined as the difference between the response expected from the considered\nsource of stimulation and the response actually perceived by the elicited\norganism. This definition is equivalent to that adopted in TD and\nPC models, and relies on experimental observations acquired in functional\nimaging studies \\cite{Berns2001,Doherty2003,Garrison2013}, or directly\nmeasured in dopaminergic circuits (e.g., in the \\emph{ventral tegmental\narea}, VTA) or in other fear-related circuits \\cite{Bray2007,Delgado2008b,Li2014,McNally2011,Schultz2000,schultz2000b,Schultz2006,Steinberg2013,Waelti2001}.\nThe relationship between the mechanisms of classical conditioning\nlearning and that of UCS revaluation learning is taken into consideration\nnext. In particular, we analyse the different mechanisms involved\nin the encoding of a CS and of an UCS, and show how the two resulting\nneural representations lead to specific different properties. Furthermore,\nwe show that a) what is observed during classical conditioning is\nactually an interrelated effect of both associative and UCS revaluation\nlearning mechanisms, b) only the latter is driven by the emotional\nsystem through the computation of emotional error signals (this important\nresult is supported by experimental evidence obtained from optogenetic\nmanipulations \\cite{Gore2015,Redondo2014}). After showing how the\nRescorla-Wagner equation for classical conditioning can be analitically\nderived from the proposed model for implicit emotional learning under\nspecific conditions, we propose a more complete model for Pavlovian\nconditioning; in doing so, the stochastic Hebbian plasticity rule\n\\cite{Amit1994,Fusi2002,Fusi2007,Hebb1949,Soltani2006,Soltani2010}\nis exploited. The proposed model is able to predict specific phenomena\nwhich cannot be explained by the currently available classical conditioning\nmodels (such as\\emph{ the dependence of asymptotic responding on CS\nintensity and US intensity}; \\cite{Miller1995,Young1976}). Furthermore,\nwe discuss how the \\emph{conditioned inhibition }\\cite{Rescorla1969}\nand some related phenomena (such as the failure of the extinction\nof conditioned inhibition through nonreinforced presentations of the\ninhibitor; \\cite{devito1987,Harris2014}), which cannot be described\nin terms of classical conditioning \\cite{Harris2014,Miller1995},\ncan be quantitatively predicted by the proposed theory. Then, we analyse\nthe case in which the emotional system is elicited by a continuous\ntime-varying source of stimulation (e.g., a time-varying acoustic\nstimulation, such as music; \\cite{Koelsch2014}), and we show how\nour model can be extended to provide some mathematical and neurophysiological\nindications. Our model is then exploited to quantitatively describe\nsome (system-level) mechanisms leading to a resistance-to-extinction\nof an emotional response (i.e., inextinguishability over successive\ntrials or over time) under certain conditions, and to illustrate some\nmechanisms through which an emotional reactive response associated\nwith a primary stimulus can be artificially strengthened/mitigated.\nThis provides new insights on various psychiatric pathologies, like\npanic attacks \\cite{Meuret2006}, \\emph{post traumatic stress disorder}\n(PTSD; e.g., see \\cite{book_traumatic2012,Parsons2013,Perusini2016}),\nand psychological phenomena like \\emph{evaluative conditioning} (EC)\n\\cite{Baeyens1992,Baeyens2005,Dawson2007a,DeHouwer2001,Gast2012,Gawronski2014,Hardwick2000,Hofmann2010,Hutter2013,Jones2009,Sweldens2010,Sweldens2014}\n(which are known to be resistant to extinction \\cite{Baeyens2005,Jones2009}).\n\nFinally, we summarise our main findings and discuss the potential\nimplications of our results on future research on emotion processing.\n\n\n\\part*{Methods}\n\n\n\\section{Response representation\\label{sec:Response-representation}}\n\nThis Section is organized as follows. In Section \\ref{sub:Stimulus-induced-response:}\nthe emotional and non-emotional components of the \\emph{central nervous\nsystem} (CNS) response to a given stimulus are analysed and vector\nrepresentations for such a response are developed. Then, in Section\n\\ref{sub:Active-and-reactive} the active and reactive components\nof an emotional response are introduced. Finally, the specific features\nof the reactive response are discussed in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Components and vector representation of a brain response\\label{sub:Stimulus-induced-response:}}\n\nGenerally speaking, in a mammalian CNS the \\emph{response} (i.e.,\nthe effect) elicited by a given stimulus consists of distinct \\emph{components},\neach involving a multitude of neuronal and receptor families; this\nresponse (or effect) can be determined by hormonal, mechanical, acoustic,\npharmacological and/or other effects originating from the peripherical\nsystems or from the CNS itself. In the following each component of\na CNS response is associated with \\emph{a specific neuronal }(e.g.,\ndopaminergic, serotonergic, opiodergic, etc.)\\emph{ population} \\emph{within\na given brain region} (e.g., the population of dopaminergic neurons\nin the \\emph{ventral tegmental area}, VTA). For this reason, if $N$\ndistinct components can be identified in the CNS, the considered response\ncan be represented as a row vector $\\mathbf{y}=[y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{N}]$\nbelonging to a $N$-dimensional space, called CNS \\emph{space} in\nthe following; moreover, this vector can be expressed as the linear\ncombination of $N$ \\emph{versors} (i.e., unit norm vectors) $\\left\\{ \\mathbf{v}_{i};i=1,2,...,N\\right\\} $;\nthis set of versors, being associated with different neuronal populations,\nform a complete basis $\\mathcal{B}$ for the considered space. Then,\nwe have that\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{y}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}\\mathbf{v}_{i},\\label{eq:rappresentaz_base}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathbf{y}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}y_{i}\\mathbf{v}_{i},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc32</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover><mrow><msub><mi>y</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc2f</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07766.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that our response representation is suited\nto properly model various experimental results evidencing that the\nmammalian CNS is able to discriminate different emotional rewarding\ncomponents (e.g., different dopaminergic populations related to appetitive\nor rewarding stimulations). In particular, some results illustrated\nin \\cite{Schultz2000,Schultz2006} have lead to the conclusion that\nneurons can discriminate between cocaine and liquid rewards (or between\ncocaine and heroin), possibly even better than between natural rewards,\nand that in rats some neurons can be activated by lever pressing regardless\nof drug injection, whereas other neurons by pressing a lever of a\nspecific drug or natural rewards only. This shows that every external\nstimulus, such as food, a natural liquid reward or a rewarding drug,\nis able to elicit in the rat CNS some specific emotional components\nrelated to specific neuronal populations.\n\n\n\\subsection{Active and reactive emotional responses\\label{sub:Active-and-reactive}}\n\nIn this manuscript the following definitions are adopted in relation\nto a source of emotional stimulation.\n\\begin{defn}\n\\emph{\\label{def:Source-of-emotional}Source of emotional stimulation}\n\\end{defn}\nAn \\emph{emotional source of stimulation }is defined as any source\nor primary stimulus able to elicit a response involving an emotional\nor motivational component. \\medskip{}\n\n\nNote that the term ``primary stimulus'' is employed here to exclude\nany secondary stimulus (i.e., CS \\cite{Pavlov1927,Rescorla1972})\nconditioned to a source stimulus through classical conditioning; nevertheless,\neven a CS previously paired with a primary stimulus (i.e., an UCS)\nis able to elicit an emotional response. In the following we assume\nthat a given UCS is always able to elicit an emotional component (e.g.,\nan electric shock device or food), so that both the terms UCS and\nemotional source of stimulation could be used indiscriminately. \n\\begin{defn}\n\\emph{Active stimulation and active response\\label{def:Active-stimulation}}\n\\end{defn}\nAn \\emph{active emotional response} is defined as any emotional component\nelicited by a primary stimulus through direct physical (e.g. mechanical,\nchemical, pharmacological, etc.) mechanisms. Furthermore, the stimulus\nelicitation is defined as \\emph{active stimulation.} \n\n\\medskip{}\nIt is worth mentioning that the adjective ``active'' refers to the\nfact that the considered response is substained through an active\nand physical action of the considered external source of stimulation. \n\nReal world examples of a stimulus eliciting an active response are\nprovided by a drug able to stimulate an emotional or motivational\ncomponent (through pharmacological mechanisms), a pain stimulus (originating,\nfor instance, from an electric shock delivery), or food.\n\nGenerally speaking, the active response can be represented as a non-linear\nand time-varying function of the physical stimulation generating it\nand of the internal physiological states (note that the time-variance\nof this function accounts, for instance, for \\emph{habituation} effect\nor for \\emph{receptor upregulation and downregulation} \\cite{Goodman2006}).\nMoreover, the active response may be influenced by various physical\nfeatures of the source stimulus, such as its frequency, rate of change\nand magnitude of the elicitation.\n\\begin{defn}\n\\emph{Reactive stimulation and reactive response}\n\\end{defn}\nA \\emph{reactive emotional response} (or non-active response) is defined\nas any emotional component ``self-induced'' by the perception of\na stimulus; such a response is not actively sustained by any external\nphysical (e.g. mechanical, chemical, pharmacological, etc.) mechanism.\nFurthermore, the stimulus elicitation is defined as \\emph{reactive\nstimulation.} \n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the adjective ``reactive'' refers to the\nfact that the considered response is reactively eicited as the stimulus\nis perceived and it is not substained through any direct physical\nmechanism.\n\nA real word example of a stimulus eliciting a reactive response is\nprovided by a CS previously paired with a primary stimulus; in this\ncase the elicited reactive response is called \\emph{coditioned reflex}\n\\cite{Pavlov1927}. The non-active response can be elicited also through\nthe mere perception of a primary source of stimulation, such as a\nthreatening stimulus (e.g. a spider or a snake) or food. Such a source\nof stimulation could be innate (e.g., represented by a biological/phylogenetic\nfear-related threat, such as a spider, a snake or an angry face \\cite{Flykt2007,Ohman1993,Ohman1994})\nor learned (e.g., an ontogenetic source like a gun \\cite{Flykt2007}). \n\nIt is important to point out that, from an evolutionary perspective,\nemotional reactive responses are fundamental for the survival of individuals\nsince they can elicit behavioral responses without the need for individuals\nto phisically re-experiencing a given source elicitation (e.g., a\nsnake bite), or they act to turn individual attention to positive\nvalenced sources, such as food. For this reason, reactive responses\nare learned through the emotional system in order to induce a proper\nreaction whenever individuals face sources of stimulation or other\ncues signalling a primary stimulus. As it will be discussed in more\ndetail in Section \\ref{sub:amygdala-role}, reactive responses are\nelicited through the amygdala, since, in the absence of an intact\namygdala, no reactive response or conditioned reflex can occur \\cite{Bechara1995}.\nIt is also worth mentioning that a primary stimulus is able to elicit\nboth an active emotional response and a reactive emotional response;\non the contrary a secondary stimulus (i.e., a CS) can elicit a reactive\nresponse only. \n\nGiven the definitions and the considerations illustrated above, the\nemotional vector $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$ can be expressed as\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17681, "prevtext": "\nwhere $y_{i}$ is a real quantity representing the product between\nthe mean number of elicited neurons and their mean firing rates for\nthe $i$-th neuronal population (with $i=1,2,...,N$); consequently,\n$y_{i}$ takes on a positive (negative) value if the response produces\nan increase of (a decrease or inhibition of) the activity for the\n$i$-th population, and is equal to zero whenever the response does\nnot involve any adjustment for the baseline activity of the population.\nIt is also important to point out that, generally speaking, the versors\nforming the basis $\\mathcal{B}$ are not orthogonal, since a specific\ncomponent can be (linearly or non-linearly, and directly or indirectly)\nrelated with other components. This fact is exemplified by the dopaminergic\nnigrostriatal population (associated with motor functions) and the\ndopaminergic neurons within the mesolimbic system (associated with\nmotivation and reward functions); in fact, these populations are not\nsimply differentiated from an anatomic viewpoint and significant functional\ninteractions between them have been observed (e.g., see \\cite{Wise2009}\nand references therein). Furthermore, given a specific region, a neuronal\npopulation can influence another population (e.g., the noradrenergic\nneuronal population can interact with the dopamine neurons \\cite{Paladini2004}).\nFrom a neurochemical perspective, the motivation for the interdependencies\nbetween different components is represented by the fact that a given\nneurotransmitter may simultaneously interact with all the various\nisoforms of its receptor on neurons that also are under the influence\nof multiple other afferent pathways and their transmitters \\cite{Goodman2006}.\n\nThe components forming the response elicited by a given stimulus can\nbe classified on the basis of different criteria. A fundamental criterion\nconsists in distinguishing \\emph{emotional }components from \\emph{non-emotional\n}ones. In practice, the \\emph{emotional} component of a given response\nis due to all the emotional and motivational neuronal systems and\ninfluences the mesocortical limbic structures contributing to approach\nand avoidance behaviors \\cite{Parsons2015}. On the contrary, the\n\\emph{non-emotional} components originate from all the neuronal systems\nnot belonging to the emotional/motivational systems (e.g., to the\nnigrostriatal dopaminergic system or the sensorimotor system). Note\nthat, generally speaking, emotional and non-emotional components can\nbe interdependent; for instance, they can be causally related (e.g.,\n\\emph{physical} and \\emph{emotional} pains are correlated) or indirectly\nrelated (e.g., emotional components can influence the immune response\n\\cite{Barak2006,Benedetti2008,cacioppo2007,Leary1990,Steinman2004}).\nThis differentiation between emotional and non-emotional components\ncan be included in the vector model sketched above by identifying\nan emotional sub-space within the CNS space, as exemplified by Fig.\n1. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\noindent \\centering{}\\includegraphics{figure1}\\caption{Bidimensional representation of the CNS space and the emotional sub-space.\nA generic elicited response in the CNS space is also sketched. }\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFurthermore, the emotional (non-emotional) response components are\ncollected in the vector $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$ ($\\mathbf{y}_{ne}$) and\noverall CNS can be represented as the concatenation of the two aforementioned\nvectors, i.e. as\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{y}=[\\mathbf{y}_{em},\\mathbf{y}_{ne}].\\label{eq:em-ne-components}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathbf{y}=[\\mathbf{y}_{em},\\mathbf{y}_{ne}].\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc32</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc32</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc32</mi><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07766.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$ ($\\mathbf{y}_{rem}$) represents the active\n(reactive) portion of $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$.\n\nIn the literature various results are available about the latency\nand decay of emotional responses. First of all, the latency of an\nemotional response is usually deemed negligible; however, its decay\nis a time-consuming process for all nontrivial or pronunced emotional\nstates \\cite{Bryant2003a,Hull1943,Scott2007,Zillmann1971}. In analysing\nthe decay of a response, it should be always kept into account that\nany emotional response can be decomposed in two main \\emph{functional\nfactors}, namely the \\emph{dominantly neurally controlled factor}\nand the \\emph{dominantly humorally controlled factor}. The former\nfactor has a faster decay after the end of the stimulation, whereas\nthe latter one is relatively slower \\cite{Zillmann1971} and can elicit\nneural responses. For this reason, the different factors of both reactive\nand active responses extinguish after their elicitation at different\nspeeds. For this reason, it can be always assumed that at least a\nportion of both active and reactive responses extinguishes quite slowly\n(e.g., this portion is related to hormones and neuromodulators decay).\nMoreover, at a given instant a generic active or reactive response\ncan be in its \\emph{active state} (e.g., instantiated, or during an\nactive elicitation) or in its \\emph{passive state }(i.e., during the\ndecay interval following the end of an active elicitation).\n\nThe most important ideas illustrated in this Section can be summarized\nin Fig. 2, which shows the different types of the emotional response\nthat can be elicited by a generic source of stimulation and the mathematical\nnotation adopted to denote them.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\noindent \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics{figure2}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\caption{{\\footnotesize{}Representation of the different types of CNS response\nelicited by a generic source of stimulation.}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{On the nature of reactive emotional responses\\label{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error} }\n\nAs already stated in the previous Section, a generic CS can elicit\na reactive emotional response only, unless it also represents a primary\nsource of stimulation.

Various results are already available about this issue\nin the literature. In particular, it is well known that the \\emph{unconscious/implicit}\nplacebo/nocebo effect can be interpreted as a conditioning process\nin which a primary stimulus (e.g., a drug) become paired with a CS\n(e.g., the substance administration or other cues) \\cite{Benedetti2008,Colloca2008a,Colloca2008,Colloca2011,Colloca2010,Jensen2012,Jensen2014,Lui2010,Montgomery1997,Nolan2012,Watson2009,Williams2004}.\nAfter some effective pairings, a successive presentation of the CS\n(e.g., the administration of an inerte substance), in the absence\nof any active physical/pharmachological stimulation, is able to elicit\na purely reactive response which mimics the previous active response\ndue to the primary stimulus. This claim is confirmed by various brain\nimaging data, evidencing that placebos can mimic the effect of active\ndrugs and activate the same brain areas; this occurs for placebo-dopamine\nin Parkinson's disease, for placebo-analgesics or antidepressants,\nand for placebo-caffeine in healthy subjects (see \\cite{Haour2005}\nand references therein). Moreover, in \\cite{Amanzio1999} it is shown\nthat \\emph{pharmacological conditioning}, like conditioning with opioids,\nproduces placebo analgesia mediated via opioid receptors administering\nsaline infusions, and that, if conditioning is performed with nonopioid\ndrugs, other nonopioid mechanisms are involved, so that conditioning\nactivates the same specific neuronal populations as the primary stimulus.\nSimilar results and conclusions have been obtained in mice experiments\n\\cite{Guo2010}. This line of reasoning is also supported by a further\nexperiment \\cite{Ito2000} showing that an increase in dopamine release\nin the \\emph{ventral striatum}, measured through microdialysis, are\nobserved not only when rats self administer cocaine (representing\nthe UCS in the considered experiment), but also when they are solely\npresented with a tone (representing the CS) that has been previously\npaired with cocaine administration. Furthermore, experimental verification\nof the influence of nonconscious conditioned stimuli on placebo/nocebo\neffects \\cite{Jensen2012,Jensen2014} show that a reactive stimulus\nis able to interfere with a given active stimulation (e.g., an active\ndrug or a painful stimulation), by increasing or decreasing the effect\nof the active response. This suggests that common active and reactive\nresponse components can be additive or competing and, hence, both\ncontribute to the determination of the overall elicited response.\nThe last observation is also supported by further experimental results\n\\cite{Roy2009,Wagener2009,Wiech2009} which show that emotional reactive\nstimulations (e.g., the perception of emotional pictures or other\nreactive stimuli) modulate pain perception. For these reasons, if\nthe active and the reactive elicited responses involve some common\ncomponents, these, in turn, add up in an algebraic sense (see Eqs.\n(\\ref{eq:2}) and (\\ref{eq:rappresentaz_base})). A further support\nof this conclusion come from the experimental evidences described\nin \\cite{Bryant2003a,Hull1943,Zillmann1971,Zillmann1972} which show\nthat, under some conditions, an emotional excitation can be transferred\nto a successive independent source of stimulation, energizing it,\nbecause of the residual excitation due to the incomplete decay of\nthe previous emotional elicitation. This phenomenon is called \\emph{excitation\ntransfer} \\cite{Zillmann1971,Zillmann1972}.\n\nAdditional results illustrated in \\cite{Singer2004} reveal the differentiation\nbetween emotional and non-emotional components, and reactive and active\nresponses in nociceptive stimulation (in this case the pain network\ninvolves both affective or emotional components, and sensory components).\nIn particular, functional imaging experiments have evidenced that\nboth physically receiving a pain stimulus (i.e., an \\emph{active}\nstimulation) or observing a signal indicating that a loved person\n- present in the same room - is receiving a similar pain stimulus\n(i.e., a \\emph{reactive} emotional pain-related stimulus mediated\nthrough empathy) activates the bilateral \\emph{anterior insula} (AI),\nthe rostral \\emph{anterior cingulate cortex} (ACC), the brainstem\nand and the cerebellum. These results have also shown that, on the\ncontrary, activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory\ncortex, the \\emph{sensorimotor cortex} (SI/MI), and the caudal ACC\nwas specific to physically receiving pain (i.e., that non-emotional\ncomponents were exclusively due to the active response) \\cite{Singer2004}.\n\nAll the results mentioned above evidence that a CS (or a generic reactive\nstimulus) can elicit specific neural populations and that these populations\nreflect or mimic the same systems elicited by the primary stimulus\npaired with the conditioned CS; in other words, as far as the emotional\ncomponents are concerned, a \\emph{reactive} response mimics the original\n\\emph{active} response. Moreover, active and reactive responses which\ninvolve the same emotional components add up in algebraic sense. This\nobservation leads us to the following two important remarks: \n\\begin{rem}\n\\label{rem:emotional_mimicking}\n\\end{rem}\nA \\emph{reactive} response can mimic, at least, the emotional sub-space\nof a previously associated elicited \\emph{active} response. \n\n Nonetheless, we argue that a reactive response can certainly determine\nalso some non-emotional components provided that these are causally\nrelated to the emotional ones (e.g., the emotional system can influence\nthe immune response \\cite{Barak2006,Benedetti2008,cacioppo2007,Leary1990,Steinman2004},\nor the dopaminergic mesolimbic system can interact with the nigrostriatal\ndopaminergic system \\cite{DeLaFuente2001,DelaFuente2002,Wise2009}).\nFurthermore, we argue that even the \\emph{humoral immune response\nsub-space }(in particular the components of the CNS such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\naxis, HPA, or the sympathetic nervous system, SNS; \\cite{cacioppo2007}),\\emph{\n}other than the emotional sub-space, can be mimicked from an active\nresponse elicitation; this last assertion is supported by experimental\nresults related to conditioned immune response and pharmacological\nconditioning with immunosuppressive drugs \\cite{Benedetti2008,cacioppo2007,Vits2011}.\nNote also that Remark \\ref{rem:emotional_mimicking} is fundamental\non the description of the emotional dynamics (see Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}).\n\\begin{rem}\n\\label{rem:Ii+Ie}\n\\end{rem}\nIf a \\emph{reactive} and an \\emph{active} responses involve the same\ncomponents, the \\emph{reactive} response can strenghten/weaken (energize/inhibit)\\emph{\n}the\\emph{ }emotional components of the primary \\emph{active} \\emph{response}\nsince they are qualitatively indistinguishable. Hence, Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})\ncan be applied.\n\nAs it will become clearer in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of},\nthis remark will play a fundamental role in the description of emotional\ndynamics.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nOne can argue that, in some cases, a reactive response learned from\nits active counterpart does not mimic the original emotional response.\nFor instance, this occurs in \\emph{aversive conditioning}, when an\nelectric shock is used as unconditioned stimulus; in particular, it\nhas been observed that heart rate decreases during the presentation\nof a CS and, on the contrary, it increases when an active electric\nshock is given \\cite{Chance2008}. For this reason, at first glance\nreactive and active responses seem to be qualitatively different as\nthey lead to distinct behaviors. Actually, a different interpretation\nof these results can be formulated. In fact, it should not be forgotten\nthat the active response to a pain stimulus consists of two components\n(one emotional, the other one non-emotional) and the non-emotional\ncomponent could result in a behavior substantially different than\nthat produced by the elicitation of the emotional component \\emph{alone}.\nMoreover, generally speaking, in the complex mammalian CNS, different\nlevel of a specific neurotransmitter within a given brain region (determined\nby the elicitation of a specific emotional component) could lead to\ndifferent (even opposite) behavioral observations \\cite{Goodman2006}\n(this last assertion will be discussed in more detail in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-learning}).\n\n\n\\section{Error-driven learning\\label{sec:Error-driven-learning}}\n\nIn this Section the basic mechanisms involved in emotional learning\nare reviewed; in particular we focus on the role played by the amygdala\n(and other important systems) in emotional learning and on the mechanisms\nfor the generation of the error signals on which such a learning is\nbased. \n\n\n\\subsection{On the role of the amygdala in emotional learning \\label{sub:amygdala-role}}\n\nIn complex vertebrates the amygdala represents the core center in\nthe formation and storage of emotional events and in the elicitation\nof emotional responses. In particular, it is well known that the amygdala\nplays a fundamental role in encoding \\emph{emotional memories}, in\n\\emph{fear responses} and in \\emph{skin conductance response }(SCR)\\emph{\nclassical conditioning}. In fact, various results are available in\nthe literature about the involvement of the amygdala in the \\emph{acquisition\nand encoding of relevant emotional memories} \\cite{Cardinal2002,Davis1992,Namburi2015,Richardson2004,Uwano1995},\nand about the fact that these mechanisms are based on its synaptic\nplasticity \\cite{Maren2005,Namburi2015,Sigurdsson2007}. In addition,\nin a growing body of literature \\cite{Amano2011,Choi2010,Glascher2003,paton2006,Sangha2013,Schoenbaum1999}\nit is shown that amygdala is necessary for fear responses, and no\nreactive fear responses are instantiated in the absence of an intact\namygdala \\cite{Choi2010}. Finally, the analysis of patients with\na damaged brain has evidenced the importance of amygdala in SCR classical\nconditioning. This emerges, for instance, from the results illustrated\nin \\cite{Bechara1995}, where the case of a patient with selective\nbilateral destruction of his amygdala is analysed; in fact, this patient\nshows an unconditioned SCR to a UCS, but no SCR conditioning to the\npaired CS, although he is well aware of the CS-UCS relation.\n\nAll the results illustrated above lead to the conclusion that the\namygdala is necessary for the elicitation of an emotional reactive\nresponse; note, however, that, if the amygdala is damaged, an active\nelicited response (e.g., an unconditioned painful stimulus) can be\nstill elicited. Further results available in the literature evidence\nthat the amygdala mediates the emotional reaction, and that directly\nand indirectly elicits emotional and motivational areas of human brain\n\\cite{Tovote2015,Gore2015,Janak2015}. In particular, on the basis\nof information coming from the sub-cortical (i.e. thalamus) and cortical\npathways (from which perception and the representation of the features\nof any source originates) the amygdala arouses both the cortex and\nthe emotional and motivational brain regions directly and indirectly\nthrough different systems \\cite{Sah2003,LeDoux2000}, that is the\\emph{\nnucleus accumbens} (NAcc), the prefrontal cortex, the midbrain, the\nhypothalamus, the autonomic nervous system, the endocrine system and\nothers). In the following analysis we briefly refer to this group\nof systems as \\emph{system chain}. In fact, the amygdala sends projections\nto a variety of systems, and it consists of several interacting subnuclei\nthat may provide specific individual contribution to the overall emotional\ncomputation \\cite{Killcross1997,LeDoux2000,Sah2003} (in particular,\ndifferent subnuclei of the amygdala can process and elicit specific\nemotional components \\cite{Balleine2006,Blundell2001,Corbit2005,Gore2015,Killcross1997}).\nResearch activities in this field have also evidenced that that the\nrepresentation of any UCS is stored within the \\emph{basolateral amygdala}\n(BLA) \\cite{Gore2015,Redondo2014}. Note also that the amygdala mediates\nboth appetitive (i.e. rewarding) and aversive stimuli \\cite{Amano2011,Gore2015,Muramoto1993,paton2006,Sangha2013,Schoenbaum1999,Shabel2009};\nin the former case the BLA neurons project onto the NAcc, whereas\nin the latter one onto the \\emph{centromedial amygdala} (CeM) \\cite{Namburi2015}. \n\n\n\\subsection{On the generation of error signals in emotional learning\\label{sub:Error-signals-in_emotional_learning}}\n\nNeurons in several brain structures appear to code specific signals,\nthat are called \\emph{error signals} and, generally speaking, represent\nthe difference between a really experienced response and its expected\ncounterpart \\cite{schultz2000b,Schultz2006}. In the literature a\nnumber of results are available about the role played by specific\nneuronal populations in coding error signals and the nature of such\nsignals. In particular the error signals are coded in relation to\nrewards, punishments, external stimuli, and behavioral reactions \\cite{Delgado2008b,schultz2000b,Waelti2001}.\nIn some cases, dopamine neurons, norepinephrine neurons, and nucleus\nbasalis neurons broadcast prediction errors as teaching signals to\nlarge postsynaptic structures; in other cases, error signals are coded\nby selected neurons in the cerebellum, superior colliculus, frontal\neye fields, parietal cortex, striatum, and visual system, where they\ninfluence specific subgroups of neurons. In general, prediction errors\ncan be used in postsynaptic structures for the immediate selection\nof behavior or for synaptic changes underlying emotional and behavioral\nlearning \\cite{Garrison2013,schultz2000b}. Evidences of coding of\nerror signals during learning have been found in various neuroimaging\nstudies \\cite{Berns2001,Doherty2003,Garrison2013}.\n\nMore specifically, as evidenced by a growing body of literature \\cite{Bourdy2012,Delgado2008b,Schultz1998,Schultz2000,Schultz2006,Waelti2001},\nin \\emph{emotional learning,} populations of dopaminergic neurons\nencode the error signal evaluating the difference between what is\nexpected (i.e., the expected reward) and what is really occuring;\nfurthermore, this error signal is exploited to correct and modulate\nthe individual's emotional and behavioral response. The error signal\ncomputed in these dopaminergic regions can be positive or negative\nand can drive appetitive or aversive emotional reactions \\cite{Delgado2008b}. \n\nOn the basis of all the above illustrated results, it can be stated\nthat error signals driving emotional responses are evaluated in different\nbrain regions, depending on the nature of the involved emotional components;\nhowever, in emotional learning (and in the computation of the associated\nerror signal), a fundamental role is played by the \\emph{orbitofrontal\ncortex} (OFC) \\cite{Doherty2007}, which represents a key structure\nin coding and maintaining the representations of a stimulus response\n(i.e., the representation of the expected outcome associated with\na stimulus) \\cite{Doherty2004,Doherty2007}. In fact, various experimental\nresults have evidenced that the OFC generates information about expected\noutcomes (e.g., see \\cite{Takahashi2009} and references therein),\nwhich are demeed critical in the computation of prediction errors;\nthese results are consistent with the relation between the reward-related\nactivity in OFC and VTA dopamine neurons \\cite{Takahashi2009}. Experimental\nresults have also evidenced that, when OFC and midbrain data are juxtaposed,\nanticipatory activity observed in the OFC is inversely related to\ndopaminergic error signaling downstream \\cite{stalnaker2015}. This\nsuggests that the error signals in other brain areas might depend\npartly on OFC input for properly calculating the errors \\cite{Schoenbaum2009,stalnaker2015}.\nThis idea has been partially confirmed for error signals in midbrain\ndopamine neurons (at least in rats; see \\cite{Takahashi2011}). The\nOFC region has been also shown to respond to both appetitive and aversive\noutcomes \\cite{Morrison2011}, to integrate multiple sources of information\nregarding outcome signals, to code outcomes and supervise the amygdala\n(which, as already explained in the previous Section, is the key element\nfor both positive and negative-valence emotions) \\cite{EdmundT.Rolls2008,Kennerley2011,wallis2007},\nand to integrate cognitive information \\cite{Plassmann2008} (also\ncoming from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \\cite{Li2011}) in\nits evaluation and coding of emotional outcomes \\cite{Doherty2007}.\nFinally, it is worth pointing out that OFC is not necessary for Pavlovian\nconditioning, since this can be driven by prior experience; however,\nit is certainly needed for modifying the response if the predicted\noutcome is revaluated (i.e., UCS inflation and devaluation) \\cite{stalnaker2015,Gallagher1999}.\n\n\n\\subsection{On error-based emotional learning\\label{sub:On-error-based-emotional}}\n\nOn the basis of the experimental results summarised in the previous\nSection, it can be assumed that, during emotional learning, an \\emph{error\nsignal} is computed in different brain regions (e.g., the VTA), depending\non the nature of the elicited emotional response. In this process\nthe OFC plays an important role since it interacts with these brain\nregions and codes the expected response to a given stimulus (i.e.,\nthe expected UCR). Moreover, the error signal which is broadcasted\nto other brain regions including the OFC, may undergo processing and\nfusion with other information (even at a higher cognitive level) and\nis certainly sent to the amygdala, since this part of the brain is\nnecessary for the elicitation of an emotional reactive response, for\nconditioning and for the storing process of emotional stimuli.\n\nIt is also important to point out that the extended network for computing\nand coding the emotional error-signals (which we call \\emph{error\ncomputing distributed network}) can be represented as a distributed\nsystem consisting of different sub-systems and, in particular, the\nOFC, the \\emph{prefrontal cortex} (PFC), the VTA, the midbrain, the\nstriatum and others; all these interact in an iterative fashion. However,\nthe study of these multiple neural interactions is behind the scope\nof our analysis. For this reason, in the following we assume that,\nwhenever a stimulus elicits an emotional response, an error signal\nis computed and transmitted to the amygdala for updating the corresponding\nreactive emotional response; note that this error-driven mechanism\nensures adaptivity in emotional learning. As it will be shown in the\nfollowing sections, this mechanism can be quantitatively described\nand analysed by representing the emotional learning system as a dynamic\nsystem, characterised by memory elements (due to the amygdala and\nto the OFC), fed by a time-variyng error signal, and generating the\nemotional responses (i.e., the vector $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$ in Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})).\n\nIt is useful to mention that the ideas of relating brain learning\nto an \\emph{error-prediction} signal and of modelling this process\nas a \\emph{dynamic adaptive control system} have been already developed\nin various theories. The most relevant example of this approach is\nprovided by Rescorla and Wagner in their theory about \\emph{classical\nconditioning}. In fact, in this case the human brain is assumed to\nlearn from a \\emph{prediction error}, defined as the discrepancy between\na reference value and what is actually perceived by the considered\nsubject \\cite{Miller1995,Rescorla1972}. In particular, learning occurs\nthrough a mechanism that updates the expectations about the outcome\nin proportion to a prediction error, so that, across trials, the expected\noutcome converges to the actual outcome \\cite{Rescorla1972}. A variant\nof the Rescorla-Wagner theory is represented by the so called \\emph{temporal\ndifference} (TD) \\emph{learning} \\cite{Doherty2003,Schultz1997,Sutton1988,Sutton1990},\nwhich accounts for the time evolution of the response within each\ntrial. The goal of TD learning is providing a prediction, for each\ninstant $t$ in the trial during which a CS is presented, of the total\nfuture reward to be gained in that trial from time $t$ to the end\nof the trial itself \\cite{Doherty2003}. \n\nA more recent theory (known as \\emph{predictive coding} theory \\cite{Friston2008})\nformalizes the notion of the Bayesian brain, in which neural representations\nin the higher levels of cortical hierarchies generate predictions\nof representations in lower levels. These \\emph{top-down }predictions\nare compared with representations at the lower level to compute a\n\\emph{prediction error}. The resulting error-signal is passed back\nup the hierarchy to update higher representations; this recursive\nexchange of signals lead to the minimization (ideally the suppression)\nof the prediction error at each and every level to provide a hierarchical\nexplanation for sensory inputs that enter at the lowest (sensory)\nlevel. In the Bayesian jargon neuronal activity encodes beliefs or\nprobability distributions over states in the world that causes sensations\n\\cite{Friston2008}. In predictive coding theory the notion of precision\n(or confidence, which is the inverse of the variance) of the error\nsignals is also formalised, and the mechanism through which the brain\nhas to estimate and encode the precision associated with the prediction\nerrors is explained. The prediction errors are then weighted with\ntheir precision before being assimilated at a high hierarchical level.\nGenerally speaking, predictive coding assumes that organisms minimize\nan upper bound on the entropy of sensory signals (the free energy),\nwhich, under certain simplifying (Gaussian) assumptions is equivalent\nto the prediction error. The minimization of the error-signal (at\nthe different hierarchical levels of a neural network) is generally\ncomputed through a generalized gradient descent \\cite{friston2010}.\nHence, predictive coding theory leads to model the brain activity\nby means of a \\emph{neural network} with multiple neuronal layers\n(from the top high hierarchical level, to the bottom sensory level)\nwhich is governed by the backpropagation algorithm \\cite{bishop2006};\nthis algorithm leads to the minimization of the error signal, adjusting,\niteratively, the weights of the prediction errors at different network\nlayers (such weights correspond to the precisions). In \\emph{machine\nlearning} and engineering fields artificial neural networks have been\nextensively applied to a large number of learning problems \\cite{bishop2006}\n(for classification, regression or parameters estimation). Hence through\na neural network architecture, in principle, any nonlinear function\nor distribution can be learned. Predictive coding theory and the above\nmentioned concepts have been succesfully applied to perception \\cite{Friston2008}\nand motion (action) learning (the so called \\emph{active inference}\ntheory; \\cite{friston2009,friston2010}) to communication learning\n\\cite{Friston2015}; moreover, a predictive coding version of interoception\n(i.e., a model for the autonomic, metabolic, immunological regulations\nso, generally speaking, for homeostasis and allostasis, and, potentially,\neven for emotional regulations) has been proposed in \\cite{Barrelt2015,Pezzulo2015,Seth2013}.\nNonetheless, we will show (see Section \\ref{sub:diff_interoception})\nthat the interoceptive predictive coding model, which could hold for\ninteroceptive visceromotor functions (i.e., homeostasis and allostasis),\ncannot be directly applied to implicit emotional learning, since it\nwould lead to the instability of the emotional system.\n\n\n\\subsection{A new model for error-based emotional learning\\label{sub:General-hypothesis}}\n\nIn the following an error-based mathematical model for describing\nthe dynamics of implicit emotional learning is developed. The main\nfeatures of the proposed model, and its similarities and differences\nwith the models mentioned at the end of Section \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional}\nare summarised below.\n\n\\emph{A model for primary stimulus learning} - The proposed model\ndescribes the implicit learning of a UCS outcome (i.e., the UCS acquisition,\ninflation and devaluation: the UCS revaluation) and, consequently,\ndoes not immediately refer, unlike the classical conditioning models\n(like the Rescorla-Wagner and TD models), to the learning of the associative\nconnection between a UCS and a paired CS \\cite{Rescorla1974}. Further\ndetails about this are provided in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-learning},\nwhere the relationship between these two learning mechanisms is analysed\nin detail. \n\n\\emph{Implicit emotional evaluation} - In the development of our model\nit is assumed that no cognitive or suggestion processes occur during\nthe interactions between a subject and the considered UCS; for this\nreason, our attention focuses on only \\emph{implicit} (or automatic)\nemotional evaluation (in other words, information such as verbal suggestions,\ncognitive expectations, beliefs and so on, are avoided). Nevertheless,\nthe source of stimulation has to brought to the attention of the subject.\nIn particular it has to be evident that the UCS is responsible for\nthe response elicitation, so that the outcome will be correctly attribuited\nto that source. This assumption exludes the situation in which the\noutcome is misattribuited to another insignificant stimulus \\cite{Bryant2003a,Cotton1981,Jones2009,Uleman1987},\nor even not attributed (like in the case of hidden drug administration).\nFurthermore, the stimulus remains unchanged in the sequence of trials.\nUnder such assumptions, without any loss of generality, it can be\nassumed that the predicted response (i.e., the expected outcome) in\na given trial, for the given stimulus, will coincide with the response\nexperienced during the last source-subject interaction. Such an assumption\nsimplifies the following mathematical computations and does not lead\nto any loss of the generality, since, generally speaking, one might\neven assume that the predicted outcome converges during trials (or\nduring time) to the real experienced outcome through a learning mechanism.\nIn the latter case the convergence of the emotional response towards\na steady state will simply be slower.\n\n\\emph{Multidimensional nature of the error-signal and evaluation of\na single component} - As already mentioned in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error},\na mathematical representation based on multidimensional vectors should\nbe adopted to properly describe the error signal involved in emotional\nlearning and defined as the difference between the actually perceived\nresponse and its expected counterpart; this is due to the fact that\nmultiple (and specific) emotional components could be elicited by\na primary stimulus. However, in the following we focus on the dynamics\nof a \\emph{single component} to ease the reading. This choice, however,\ndoes not entail any loss of generality, since our model can be applied\nto any component.\n\n\\emph{Indistinguishability between the emotional component of an active\nresponse and the corresponding reactive learned response} - As illustrated\nin Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error}, a learned reactive\nresponse mimics the emotional components of the active response elicited\nby a primary stimulus. For this reason, we assume that the reactive\nand the active responses add up, so generating the emotional component\n$\\mathbf{y}_{em}$ (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:em-ne-components}) and Remark\n\\ref{rem:Ii+Ie}). \n\n\\emph{The essential neural network and the related neural functions}\n- The considered error signal is computed by a distribuited and dynamically\ninterconnected neural network whose master element is supposed to\nbe the OFC (see Sections \\ref{sub:Error-signals-in_emotional_learning}\nand \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional}). This error-signal is transmitted\nby the network to the amygdala, which, in turn, updates the emotional\nreactive response associated with the representation of the primary\nstimulus. The processing of the error signal inside the amygdala is\nrepresented by the (unknown) \\emph{amygdala function}, denoted $F_{A}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$\nin the following. \n\nAs already discussed in Section \\ref{sub:amygdala-role}, whenever\na primary stimulus is perceived, the amygdala elicits the reactive\nresponse previously coded for that stimulus. In particular, the amygdala\nis be able to arouse the cortex, and the emotional and motivational\nbrain regions directly and indirectly; this process involves the \\emph{system\nchain} described in Section \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional} and\noperating between the amygdala output and the emotional brain systems.\nIn the proposed model, the biological functionality of this\\emph{\nsystem chain} is described by the (unknown) \\emph{system chain function\n$F_{Ch}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$}. Note that this function does not lend\nitself to a simple description, since it is influenced by iterative\nmechanisms involving neuronal and hormonal systems, and various brain\nregions. In practice, $F_{Ch}(\\cdot)$ represents the processing which\nturns all the amygdala output signals into emotional and motivational\nresponses. These ideas are summarised in Fig. 3, which shows the functional\nrepresentation proposed for the implicit emotional learning system.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\noindent \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics{figure3}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\caption{Discrete-time representation of the mechanisms on which the implicit\nemotional learning system is based. The functional connections between\nthe involved actors and the processing task accomplished by each block\nare shown. In particular, a stimulus could exert an active stimulation,\na reactive stimulation or both; in case of a reactive stimulation,\nthe stimulus is perceived and, successively, the amygdala elicits\nthe associated reactive response. The amygdala output is being processed\nby the system chain network, which involve all the systems between\nthe amygdala output and the emotional/motivational brain regions (e.g.,\nthe nucleus accumbens, the sympathetic system, the hypothalamus and\nothers). The orbitofrontal cortex updates the expected response associated\nto a given stimulus and drives the error computation network for the\ncomputation of the emotional error signals. The error signals are\nsent to the amygdala which updates the reactive responses associated\nto the given stimulus. The processes involved in the discrete-time\nemotional system are discuss in detail in the following sections.}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\emph{Functional approximations} - Generally speaking, the functions\n$F_{A}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ and $F_{Ch}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ may change\nover time, and are expected to be influenced by the internal physiological\nstates at the time the stimulus is encountered \\cite{Toates1986,Cabanac1992,Dickinson1994,Balleine1998},\nexternal circumstances and various features of the eliciting stimulus.\nMoreover, it is expected that the amygdala function depends also on\nthe elicited sensory modality (e.g., auditory, visual, olfactory).\nFinally, the behavior of these functions change from component to\ncomponent. However, in the following it is always assumed, for simplicity,\nthat these functions are static; consequently, the influence of all\nthe above mentioned factors and possible habituation effects are not\ntaken into consideration. Moreover, their dependence on the considered\nemotional component is not highlighted by the adopted mathematical\nnotation since, as already mentioned above, we focus on a single emotional\ncomponent.\n\n\n\\section{A novel discrete-time dynamic model for the implicit acquisition\n(and inflation) and devaluation (and extinction) of an emotional source\\label{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}}\n\nIn this Section the discrete-time dynamic models for \\emph{implicit\nemotional learning} during the \\emph{source acquisition} (and \\emph{inflation})\nand \\emph{devaluation }\\cite{Rescorla1974,Schultz2013,Gottfried2004}\n(and extinction) are developed. In particular, the source acquisition\nrepresents the process through which an emotional source of stimulation\n(i.e., UCS) is detected and coded within the brain; the inflation\n(devaluation), instead, represents the process through which an UCS\noutcome (i.e., an UCR) increases (decreases) with respect to the previously\ncoded UCR. At the beginning of our study some additional hypotheses\nneeded in the development of our model (and complementing the hypotheses\nillustrated in Section \\ref{sub:General-hypothesis}) are listed and\nproperly motivated, and some details about the adopted mathematical\nnotation are provided.\n\n\n\\subsection{Additional hypothesis and mathematical notation\\label{sub:specific_hyp_discrete}}\n\nUnless explicitly stated, the following hypotheses hold in the development\nof our model.\n\nH.1 - \\emph{Discrete trials} - Multiple trials in the interaction\nbetween a source and a subject are considered; the trial duration\n$\\triangle T$ is assumed to be relatively small and, in particular,\nnegligible with respect to the \\emph{inter-trial interval }(ITI) $T$.\nFor this reason, each trial can be ideally associated with a specific\npoint on the time axis and the corresponding emotional response can\nbe deemed constant, so that a \\emph{discrete time scale }\\cite{Bohner2001}\ncan be adopted in the representation of the considered phenomena.\n\nH.2 - \\emph{Residual response from previous trials} - The time constant\n$\\tau$ associated with the decay of the response elicited during\neach trial is deemed negligible respect to the inter-trial interval\n$T$; consequently, when a new trial takes place, the emotional response\ndue to the previous trials has already vanished.\n\nH.3 - \\emph{Novelty of the} \\emph{source of stimulation} - The stimulus\neliciting the emotional response is assumed to be neutral before the\nstart of the trials (e.g., it is not a phylogenetic innate source\nof stimulation). \n\nH.4 - \\emph{Stimulus perception} - The perceived stimulus is the same\nin each trial, so as the associated contextual information and boundary\nconditions. This assumption states that, if a stimulus elicits a subject\nduring the first trial in a specific context (e.g., place, timing,\nand specific boundary conditions), it has to be considered that the\n\\emph{stimulus perception} in the following trials involves exactly\nthe same contextual and boundary conditions. In the absence of such\nan assumption the reactive response elicited by the stimulus perception\nmight be modulated by the different contextual information and boundary\nconditions. For instance, the perception of a threatening stimulus\n(e.g., a snake) at a short distance and without barriers should elicit\na reactive response stronger than that due to the same stimulus perceived\nat a larger distance or in the presence of a separation barrier (i.e.,\nwith different boundary conditions and context).\n\nH.5 - \\emph{Response evolution} - During the process of source acquisition,\nthe emotional response increases monotonically over successive trials;\nthis assumption is motivated by the definition of acquisition and\nconsolidation of a source stimulus (hence, the extinction or de-valuation\nprocesses are not taken into consideration in this case). On the contrary,\nduring the process of source devaluation or extinction, a monotonical\ndecrease of the emotional response is observed.\n\nH.6 - \\emph{Stability of the emotional system} - The emotional response\ndoes not diverge (i.e., does not tend to infinity) as the number of\ntrials increases. \n\nIn our analysis the following mathematical notation is adopted. The\nemotional response and the active emotional component characterizing\nthe $n$-th trial are denoted $y_{n}$ and $x_{n}$, respectively\n(note that these quantities correspond to the terms $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$\nand $\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$, respectively, in Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})), where\n$n$ is the trial index (with \\emph{$n=1,2,...$}). In principle,\nthe dependence of $y_{n}$ and $x_{n}$ (and that of the amygdala\nfunction $F_{A}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ and of the corresponding system\nchain function\\emph{ $F_{Ch}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$}; see the last part\nof Section \\ref{sub:General-hypothesis}) on the emotional space component\nthey refer to should be indicated; in the following, however, such\na dependence is omitted to ease the reading. Note also that H.3 entails\nthat\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 23669, "prevtext": "\n\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that our response representation is suited\nto properly model various experimental results evidencing that the\nmammalian CNS is able to discriminate different emotional rewarding\ncomponents (e.g., different dopaminergic populations related to appetitive\nor rewarding stimulations). In particular, some results illustrated\nin \\cite{Schultz2000,Schultz2006} have lead to the conclusion that\nneurons can discriminate between cocaine and liquid rewards (or between\ncocaine and heroin), possibly even better than between natural rewards,\nand that in rats some neurons can be activated by lever pressing regardless\nof drug injection, whereas other neurons by pressing a lever of a\nspecific drug or natural rewards only. This shows that every external\nstimulus, such as food, a natural liquid reward or a rewarding drug,\nis able to elicit in the rat CNS some specific emotional components\nrelated to specific neuronal populations.\n\n\n\\subsection{Active and reactive emotional responses\\label{sub:Active-and-reactive}}\n\nIn this manuscript the following definitions are adopted in relation\nto a source of emotional stimulation.\n\\begin{defn}\n\\emph{\\label{def:Source-of-emotional}Source of emotional stimulation}\n\\end{defn}\nAn \\emph{emotional source of stimulation }is defined as any source\nor primary stimulus able to elicit a response involving an emotional\nor motivational component. \\medskip{}\n\n\nNote that the term ``primary stimulus'' is employed here to exclude\nany secondary stimulus (i.e., CS \\cite{Pavlov1927,Rescorla1972})\nconditioned to a source stimulus through classical conditioning; nevertheless,\neven a CS previously paired with a primary stimulus (i.e., an UCS)\nis able to elicit an emotional response. In the following we assume\nthat a given UCS is always able to elicit an emotional component (e.g.,\nan electric shock device or food), so that both the terms UCS and\nemotional source of stimulation could be used indiscriminately. \n\\begin{defn}\n\\emph{Active stimulation and active response\\label{def:Active-stimulation}}\n\\end{defn}\nAn \\emph{active emotional response} is defined as any emotional component\nelicited by a primary stimulus through direct physical (e.g. mechanical,\nchemical, pharmacological, etc.) mechanisms. Furthermore, the stimulus\nelicitation is defined as \\emph{active stimulation.} \n\n\\medskip{}\nIt is worth mentioning that the adjective ``active'' refers to the\nfact that the considered response is substained through an active\nand physical action of the considered external source of stimulation. \n\nReal world examples of a stimulus eliciting an active response are\nprovided by a drug able to stimulate an emotional or motivational\ncomponent (through pharmacological mechanisms), a pain stimulus (originating,\nfor instance, from an electric shock delivery), or food.\n\nGenerally speaking, the active response can be represented as a non-linear\nand time-varying function of the physical stimulation generating it\nand of the internal physiological states (note that the time-variance\nof this function accounts, for instance, for \\emph{habituation} effect\nor for \\emph{receptor upregulation and downregulation} \\cite{Goodman2006}).\nMoreover, the active response may be influenced by various physical\nfeatures of the source stimulus, such as its frequency, rate of change\nand magnitude of the elicitation.\n\\begin{defn}\n\\emph{Reactive stimulation and reactive response}\n\\end{defn}\nA \\emph{reactive emotional response} (or non-active response) is defined\nas any emotional component ``self-induced'' by the perception of\na stimulus; such a response is not actively sustained by any external\nphysical (e.g. mechanical, chemical, pharmacological, etc.) mechanism.\nFurthermore, the stimulus elicitation is defined as \\emph{reactive\nstimulation.} \n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nIt is worth noting that the adjective ``reactive'' refers to the\nfact that the considered response is reactively eicited as the stimulus\nis perceived and it is not substained through any direct physical\nmechanism.\n\nA real word example of a stimulus eliciting a reactive response is\nprovided by a CS previously paired with a primary stimulus; in this\ncase the elicited reactive response is called \\emph{coditioned reflex}\n\\cite{Pavlov1927}. The non-active response can be elicited also through\nthe mere perception of a primary source of stimulation, such as a\nthreatening stimulus (e.g. a spider or a snake) or food. Such a source\nof stimulation could be innate (e.g., represented by a biological/phylogenetic\nfear-related threat, such as a spider, a snake or an angry face \\cite{Flykt2007,Ohman1993,Ohman1994})\nor learned (e.g., an ontogenetic source like a gun \\cite{Flykt2007}). \n\nIt is important to point out that, from an evolutionary perspective,\nemotional reactive responses are fundamental for the survival of individuals\nsince they can elicit behavioral responses without the need for individuals\nto phisically re-experiencing a given source elicitation (e.g., a\nsnake bite), or they act to turn individual attention to positive\nvalenced sources, such as food. For this reason, reactive responses\nare learned through the emotional system in order to induce a proper\nreaction whenever individuals face sources of stimulation or other\ncues signalling a primary stimulus. As it will be discussed in more\ndetail in Section \\ref{sub:amygdala-role}, reactive responses are\nelicited through the amygdala, since, in the absence of an intact\namygdala, no reactive response or conditioned reflex can occur \\cite{Bechara1995}.\nIt is also worth mentioning that a primary stimulus is able to elicit\nboth an active emotional response and a reactive emotional response;\non the contrary a secondary stimulus (i.e., a CS) can elicit a reactive\nresponse only. \n\nGiven the definitions and the considerations illustrated above, the\nemotional vector $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$ can be expressed as\n\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbf{y}_{em}=\\mathbf{y}_{aem}+\\mathbf{y}_{rem}\\label{eq:2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathbf{y}_{em}=\\mathbf{y}_{aem}+\\mathbf{y}_{rem}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc32</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc32</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc32</mi><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07766.tex", "nexttext": "\nsince the first trial corresponds to $n=1$, whereas H.5 leads to\nthe inequality\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 62388, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$ ($\\mathbf{y}_{rem}$) represents the active\n(reactive) portion of $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$.\n\nIn the literature various results are available about the latency\nand decay of emotional responses. First of all, the latency of an\nemotional response is usually deemed negligible; however, its decay\nis a time-consuming process for all nontrivial or pronunced emotional\nstates \\cite{Bryant2003a,Hull1943,Scott2007,Zillmann1971}. In analysing\nthe decay of a response, it should be always kept into account that\nany emotional response can be decomposed in two main \\emph{functional\nfactors}, namely the \\emph{dominantly neurally controlled factor}\nand the \\emph{dominantly humorally controlled factor}. The former\nfactor has a faster decay after the end of the stimulation, whereas\nthe latter one is relatively slower \\cite{Zillmann1971} and can elicit\nneural responses. For this reason, the different factors of both reactive\nand active responses extinguish after their elicitation at different\nspeeds. For this reason, it can be always assumed that at least a\nportion of both active and reactive responses extinguishes quite slowly\n(e.g., this portion is related to hormones and neuromodulators decay).\nMoreover, at a given instant a generic active or reactive response\ncan be in its \\emph{active state} (e.g., instantiated, or during an\nactive elicitation) or in its \\emph{passive state }(i.e., during the\ndecay interval following the end of an active elicitation).\n\nThe most important ideas illustrated in this Section can be summarized\nin Fig. 2, which shows the different types of the emotional response\nthat can be elicited by a generic source of stimulation and the mathematical\nnotation adopted to denote them.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\noindent \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics{figure2}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\caption{{\\footnotesize{}Representation of the different types of CNS response\nelicited by a generic source of stimulation.}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{On the nature of reactive emotional responses\\label{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error} }\n\nAs already stated in the previous Section, a generic CS can elicit\na reactive emotional response only, unless it also represents a primary\nsource of stimulation. For this reason, the observation of the responses\nelicited by different CSs can unveil the specific properties of reactive\nresponses. Various results are already available about this issue\nin the literature. In particular, it is well known that the \\emph{unconscious/implicit}\nplacebo/nocebo effect can be interpreted as a conditioning process\nin which a primary stimulus (e.g., a drug) become paired with a CS\n(e.g., the substance administration or other cues) \\cite{Benedetti2008,Colloca2008a,Colloca2008,Colloca2011,Colloca2010,Jensen2012,Jensen2014,Lui2010,Montgomery1997,Nolan2012,Watson2009,Williams2004}.\nAfter some effective pairings, a successive presentation of the CS\n(e.g., the administration of an inerte substance), in the absence\nof any active physical/pharmachological stimulation, is able to elicit\na purely reactive response which mimics the previous active response\ndue to the primary stimulus. This claim is confirmed by various brain\nimaging data, evidencing that placebos can mimic the effect of active\ndrugs and activate the same brain areas; this occurs for placebo-dopamine\nin Parkinson's disease, for placebo-analgesics or antidepressants,\nand for placebo-caffeine in healthy subjects (see \\cite{Haour2005}\nand references therein). Moreover, in \\cite{Amanzio1999} it is shown\nthat \\emph{pharmacological conditioning}, like conditioning with opioids,\nproduces placebo analgesia mediated via opioid receptors administering\nsaline infusions, and that, if conditioning is performed with nonopioid\ndrugs, other nonopioid mechanisms are involved, so that conditioning\nactivates the same specific neuronal populations as the primary stimulus.\nSimilar results and conclusions have been obtained in mice experiments\n\\cite{Guo2010}. This line of reasoning is also supported by a further\nexperiment \\cite{Ito2000} showing that an increase in dopamine release\nin the \\emph{ventral striatum}, measured through microdialysis, are\nobserved not only when rats self administer cocaine (representing\nthe UCS in the considered experiment), but also when they are solely\npresented with a tone (representing the CS) that has been previously\npaired with cocaine administration. Furthermore, experimental verification\nof the influence of nonconscious conditioned stimuli on placebo/nocebo\neffects \\cite{Jensen2012,Jensen2014} show that a reactive stimulus\nis able to interfere with a given active stimulation (e.g., an active\ndrug or a painful stimulation), by increasing or decreasing the effect\nof the active response. This suggests that common active and reactive\nresponse components can be additive or competing and, hence, both\ncontribute to the determination of the overall elicited response.\nThe last observation is also supported by further experimental results\n\\cite{Roy2009,Wagener2009,Wiech2009} which show that emotional reactive\nstimulations (e.g., the perception of emotional pictures or other\nreactive stimuli) modulate pain perception. For these reasons, if\nthe active and the reactive elicited responses involve some common\ncomponents, these, in turn, add up in an algebraic sense (see Eqs.\n(\\ref{eq:2}) and (\\ref{eq:rappresentaz_base})). A further support\nof this conclusion come from the experimental evidences described\nin \\cite{Bryant2003a,Hull1943,Zillmann1971,Zillmann1972} which show\nthat, under some conditions, an emotional excitation can be transferred\nto a successive independent source of stimulation, energizing it,\nbecause of the residual excitation due to the incomplete decay of\nthe previous emotional elicitation. This phenomenon is called \\emph{excitation\ntransfer} \\cite{Zillmann1971,Zillmann1972}.\n\nAdditional results illustrated in \\cite{Singer2004} reveal the differentiation\nbetween emotional and non-emotional components, and reactive and active\nresponses in nociceptive stimulation (in this case the pain network\ninvolves both affective or emotional components, and sensory components).\nIn particular, functional imaging experiments have evidenced that\nboth physically receiving a pain stimulus (i.e., an \\emph{active}\nstimulation) or observing a signal indicating that a loved person\n- present in the same room - is receiving a similar pain stimulus\n(i.e., a \\emph{reactive} emotional pain-related stimulus mediated\nthrough empathy) activates the bilateral \\emph{anterior insula} (AI),\nthe rostral \\emph{anterior cingulate cortex} (ACC), the brainstem\nand and the cerebellum. These results have also shown that, on the\ncontrary, activity in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory\ncortex, the \\emph{sensorimotor cortex} (SI/MI), and the caudal ACC\nwas specific to physically receiving pain (i.e., that non-emotional\ncomponents were exclusively due to the active response) \\cite{Singer2004}.\n\nAll the results mentioned above evidence that a CS (or a generic reactive\nstimulus) can elicit specific neural populations and that these populations\nreflect or mimic the same systems elicited by the primary stimulus\npaired with the conditioned CS; in other words, as far as the emotional\ncomponents are concerned, a \\emph{reactive} response mimics the original\n\\emph{active} response. Moreover, active and reactive responses which\ninvolve the same emotional components add up in algebraic sense. This\nobservation leads us to the following two important remarks: \n\\begin{rem}\n\\label{rem:emotional_mimicking}\n\\end{rem}\nA \\emph{reactive} response can mimic, at least, the emotional sub-space\nof a previously associated elicited \\emph{active} response. \n\n Nonetheless, we argue that a reactive response can certainly determine\nalso some non-emotional components provided that these are causally\nrelated to the emotional ones (e.g., the emotional system can influence\nthe immune response \\cite{Barak2006,Benedetti2008,cacioppo2007,Leary1990,Steinman2004},\nor the dopaminergic mesolimbic system can interact with the nigrostriatal\ndopaminergic system \\cite{DeLaFuente2001,DelaFuente2002,Wise2009}).\nFurthermore, we argue that even the \\emph{humoral immune response\nsub-space }(in particular the components of the CNS such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\naxis, HPA, or the sympathetic nervous system, SNS; \\cite{cacioppo2007}),\\emph{\n}other than the emotional sub-space, can be mimicked from an active\nresponse elicitation; this last assertion is supported by experimental\nresults related to conditioned immune response and pharmacological\nconditioning with immunosuppressive drugs \\cite{Benedetti2008,cacioppo2007,Vits2011}.\nNote also that Remark \\ref{rem:emotional_mimicking} is fundamental\non the description of the emotional dynamics (see Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}).\n\\begin{rem}\n\\label{rem:Ii+Ie}\n\\end{rem}\nIf a \\emph{reactive} and an \\emph{active} responses involve the same\ncomponents, the \\emph{reactive} response can strenghten/weaken (energize/inhibit)\\emph{\n}the\\emph{ }emotional components of the primary \\emph{active} \\emph{response}\nsince they are qualitatively indistinguishable. Hence, Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})\ncan be applied.\n\nAs it will become clearer in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of},\nthis remark will play a fundamental role in the description of emotional\ndynamics.\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\nOne can argue that, in some cases, a reactive response learned from\nits active counterpart does not mimic the original emotional response.\nFor instance, this occurs in \\emph{aversive conditioning}, when an\nelectric shock is used as unconditioned stimulus; in particular, it\nhas been observed that heart rate decreases during the presentation\nof a CS and, on the contrary, it increases when an active electric\nshock is given \\cite{Chance2008}. For this reason, at first glance\nreactive and active responses seem to be qualitatively different as\nthey lead to distinct behaviors. Actually, a different interpretation\nof these results can be formulated. In fact, it should not be forgotten\nthat the active response to a pain stimulus consists of two components\n(one emotional, the other one non-emotional) and the non-emotional\ncomponent could result in a behavior substantially different than\nthat produced by the elicitation of the emotional component \\emph{alone}.\nMoreover, generally speaking, in the complex mammalian CNS, different\nlevel of a specific neurotransmitter within a given brain region (determined\nby the elicitation of a specific emotional component) could lead to\ndifferent (even opposite) behavioral observations \\cite{Goodman2006}\n(this last assertion will be discussed in more detail in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-learning}).\n\n\n\\section{Error-driven learning\\label{sec:Error-driven-learning}}\n\nIn this Section the basic mechanisms involved in emotional learning\nare reviewed; in particular we focus on the role played by the amygdala\n(and other important systems) in emotional learning and on the mechanisms\nfor the generation of the error signals on which such a learning is\nbased. \n\n\n\\subsection{On the role of the amygdala in emotional learning \\label{sub:amygdala-role}}\n\nIn complex vertebrates the amygdala represents the core center in\nthe formation and storage of emotional events and in the elicitation\nof emotional responses. In particular, it is well known that the amygdala\nplays a fundamental role in encoding \\emph{emotional memories}, in\n\\emph{fear responses} and in \\emph{skin conductance response }(SCR)\\emph{\nclassical conditioning}. In fact, various results are available in\nthe literature about the involvement of the amygdala in the \\emph{acquisition\nand encoding of relevant emotional memories} \\cite{Cardinal2002,Davis1992,Namburi2015,Richardson2004,Uwano1995},\nand about the fact that these mechanisms are based on its synaptic\nplasticity \\cite{Maren2005,Namburi2015,Sigurdsson2007}. In addition,\nin a growing body of literature \\cite{Amano2011,Choi2010,Glascher2003,paton2006,Sangha2013,Schoenbaum1999}\nit is shown that amygdala is necessary for fear responses, and no\nreactive fear responses are instantiated in the absence of an intact\namygdala \\cite{Choi2010}. Finally, the analysis of patients with\na damaged brain has evidenced the importance of amygdala in SCR classical\nconditioning. This emerges, for instance, from the results illustrated\nin \\cite{Bechara1995}, where the case of a patient with selective\nbilateral destruction of his amygdala is analysed; in fact, this patient\nshows an unconditioned SCR to a UCS, but no SCR conditioning to the\npaired CS, although he is well aware of the CS-UCS relation.\n\nAll the results illustrated above lead to the conclusion that the\namygdala is necessary for the elicitation of an emotional reactive\nresponse; note, however, that, if the amygdala is damaged, an active\nelicited response (e.g., an unconditioned painful stimulus) can be\nstill elicited. Further results available in the literature evidence\nthat the amygdala mediates the emotional reaction, and that directly\nand indirectly elicits emotional and motivational areas of human brain\n\\cite{Tovote2015,Gore2015,Janak2015}. In particular, on the basis\nof information coming from the sub-cortical (i.e. thalamus) and cortical\npathways (from which perception and the representation of the features\nof any source originates) the amygdala arouses both the cortex and\nthe emotional and motivational brain regions directly and indirectly\nthrough different systems \\cite{Sah2003,LeDoux2000}, that is the\\emph{\nnucleus accumbens} (NAcc), the prefrontal cortex, the midbrain, the\nhypothalamus, the autonomic nervous system, the endocrine system and\nothers). In the following analysis we briefly refer to this group\nof systems as \\emph{system chain}. In fact, the amygdala sends projections\nto a variety of systems, and it consists of several interacting subnuclei\nthat may provide specific individual contribution to the overall emotional\ncomputation \\cite{Killcross1997,LeDoux2000,Sah2003} (in particular,\ndifferent subnuclei of the amygdala can process and elicit specific\nemotional components \\cite{Balleine2006,Blundell2001,Corbit2005,Gore2015,Killcross1997}).\nResearch activities in this field have also evidenced that that the\nrepresentation of any UCS is stored within the \\emph{basolateral amygdala}\n(BLA) \\cite{Gore2015,Redondo2014}. Note also that the amygdala mediates\nboth appetitive (i.e. rewarding) and aversive stimuli \\cite{Amano2011,Gore2015,Muramoto1993,paton2006,Sangha2013,Schoenbaum1999,Shabel2009};\nin the former case the BLA neurons project onto the NAcc, whereas\nin the latter one onto the \\emph{centromedial amygdala} (CeM) \\cite{Namburi2015}. \n\n\n\\subsection{On the generation of error signals in emotional learning\\label{sub:Error-signals-in_emotional_learning}}\n\nNeurons in several brain structures appear to code specific signals,\nthat are called \\emph{error signals} and, generally speaking, represent\nthe difference between a really experienced response and its expected\ncounterpart \\cite{schultz2000b,Schultz2006}. In the literature a\nnumber of results are available about the role played by specific\nneuronal populations in coding error signals and the nature of such\nsignals. In particular the error signals are coded in relation to\nrewards, punishments, external stimuli, and behavioral reactions \\cite{Delgado2008b,schultz2000b,Waelti2001}.\nIn some cases, dopamine neurons, norepinephrine neurons, and nucleus\nbasalis neurons broadcast prediction errors as teaching signals to\nlarge postsynaptic structures; in other cases, error signals are coded\nby selected neurons in the cerebellum, superior colliculus, frontal\neye fields, parietal cortex, striatum, and visual system, where they\ninfluence specific subgroups of neurons. In general, prediction errors\ncan be used in postsynaptic structures for the immediate selection\nof behavior or for synaptic changes underlying emotional and behavioral\nlearning \\cite{Garrison2013,schultz2000b}. Evidences of coding of\nerror signals during learning have been found in various neuroimaging\nstudies \\cite{Berns2001,Doherty2003,Garrison2013}.\n\nMore specifically, as evidenced by a growing body of literature \\cite{Bourdy2012,Delgado2008b,Schultz1998,Schultz2000,Schultz2006,Waelti2001},\nin \\emph{emotional learning,} populations of dopaminergic neurons\nencode the error signal evaluating the difference between what is\nexpected (i.e., the expected reward) and what is really occuring;\nfurthermore, this error signal is exploited to correct and modulate\nthe individual's emotional and behavioral response. The error signal\ncomputed in these dopaminergic regions can be positive or negative\nand can drive appetitive or aversive emotional reactions \\cite{Delgado2008b}. \n\nOn the basis of all the above illustrated results, it can be stated\nthat error signals driving emotional responses are evaluated in different\nbrain regions, depending on the nature of the involved emotional components;\nhowever, in emotional learning (and in the computation of the associated\nerror signal), a fundamental role is played by the \\emph{orbitofrontal\ncortex} (OFC) \\cite{Doherty2007}, which represents a key structure\nin coding and maintaining the representations of a stimulus response\n(i.e., the representation of the expected outcome associated with\na stimulus) \\cite{Doherty2004,Doherty2007}. In fact, various experimental\nresults have evidenced that the OFC generates information about expected\noutcomes (e.g., see \\cite{Takahashi2009} and references therein),\nwhich are demeed critical in the computation of prediction errors;\nthese results are consistent with the relation between the reward-related\nactivity in OFC and VTA dopamine neurons \\cite{Takahashi2009}. Experimental\nresults have also evidenced that, when OFC and midbrain data are juxtaposed,\nanticipatory activity observed in the OFC is inversely related to\ndopaminergic error signaling downstream \\cite{stalnaker2015}. This\nsuggests that the error signals in other brain areas might depend\npartly on OFC input for properly calculating the errors \\cite{Schoenbaum2009,stalnaker2015}.\nThis idea has been partially confirmed for error signals in midbrain\ndopamine neurons (at least in rats; see \\cite{Takahashi2011}). The\nOFC region has been also shown to respond to both appetitive and aversive\noutcomes \\cite{Morrison2011}, to integrate multiple sources of information\nregarding outcome signals, to code outcomes and supervise the amygdala\n(which, as already explained in the previous Section, is the key element\nfor both positive and negative-valence emotions) \\cite{EdmundT.Rolls2008,Kennerley2011,wallis2007},\nand to integrate cognitive information \\cite{Plassmann2008} (also\ncoming from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex \\cite{Li2011}) in\nits evaluation and coding of emotional outcomes \\cite{Doherty2007}.\nFinally, it is worth pointing out that OFC is not necessary for Pavlovian\nconditioning, since this can be driven by prior experience; however,\nit is certainly needed for modifying the response if the predicted\noutcome is revaluated (i.e., UCS inflation and devaluation) \\cite{stalnaker2015,Gallagher1999}.\n\n\n\\subsection{On error-based emotional learning\\label{sub:On-error-based-emotional}}\n\nOn the basis of the experimental results summarised in the previous\nSection, it can be assumed that, during emotional learning, an \\emph{error\nsignal} is computed in different brain regions (e.g., the VTA), depending\non the nature of the elicited emotional response. In this process\nthe OFC plays an important role since it interacts with these brain\nregions and codes the expected response to a given stimulus (i.e.,\nthe expected UCR). Moreover, the error signal which is broadcasted\nto other brain regions including the OFC, may undergo processing and\nfusion with other information (even at a higher cognitive level) and\nis certainly sent to the amygdala, since this part of the brain is\nnecessary for the elicitation of an emotional reactive response, for\nconditioning and for the storing process of emotional stimuli.\n\nIt is also important to point out that the extended network for computing\nand coding the emotional error-signals (which we call \\emph{error\ncomputing distributed network}) can be represented as a distributed\nsystem consisting of different sub-systems and, in particular, the\nOFC, the \\emph{prefrontal cortex} (PFC), the VTA, the midbrain, the\nstriatum and others; all these interact in an iterative fashion. However,\nthe study of these multiple neural interactions is behind the scope\nof our analysis. For this reason, in the following we assume that,\nwhenever a stimulus elicits an emotional response, an error signal\nis computed and transmitted to the amygdala for updating the corresponding\nreactive emotional response; note that this error-driven mechanism\nensures adaptivity in emotional learning. As it will be shown in the\nfollowing sections, this mechanism can be quantitatively described\nand analysed by representing the emotional learning system as a dynamic\nsystem, characterised by memory elements (due to the amygdala and\nto the OFC), fed by a time-variyng error signal, and generating the\nemotional responses (i.e., the vector $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$ in Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})).\n\nIt is useful to mention that the ideas of relating brain learning\nto an \\emph{error-prediction} signal and of modelling this process\nas a \\emph{dynamic adaptive control system} have been already developed\nin various theories. The most relevant example of this approach is\nprovided by Rescorla and Wagner in their theory about \\emph{classical\nconditioning}. In fact, in this case the human brain is assumed to\nlearn from a \\emph{prediction error}, defined as the discrepancy between\na reference value and what is actually perceived by the considered\nsubject \\cite{Miller1995,Rescorla1972}. In particular, learning occurs\nthrough a mechanism that updates the expectations about the outcome\nin proportion to a prediction error, so that, across trials, the expected\noutcome converges to the actual outcome \\cite{Rescorla1972}. A variant\nof the Rescorla-Wagner theory is represented by the so called \\emph{temporal\ndifference} (TD) \\emph{learning} \\cite{Doherty2003,Schultz1997,Sutton1988,Sutton1990},\nwhich accounts for the time evolution of the response within each\ntrial. The goal of TD learning is providing a prediction, for each\ninstant $t$ in the trial during which a CS is presented, of the total\nfuture reward to be gained in that trial from time $t$ to the end\nof the trial itself \\cite{Doherty2003}. \n\nA more recent theory (known as \\emph{predictive coding} theory \\cite{Friston2008})\nformalizes the notion of the Bayesian brain, in which neural representations\nin the higher levels of cortical hierarchies generate predictions\nof representations in lower levels. These \\emph{top-down }predictions\nare compared with representations at the lower level to compute a\n\\emph{prediction error}. The resulting error-signal is passed back\nup the hierarchy to update higher representations; this recursive\nexchange of signals lead to the minimization (ideally the suppression)\nof the prediction error at each and every level to provide a hierarchical\nexplanation for sensory inputs that enter at the lowest (sensory)\nlevel. In the Bayesian jargon neuronal activity encodes beliefs or\nprobability distributions over states in the world that causes sensations\n\\cite{Friston2008}. In predictive coding theory the notion of precision\n(or confidence, which is the inverse of the variance) of the error\nsignals is also formalised, and the mechanism through which the brain\nhas to estimate and encode the precision associated with the prediction\nerrors is explained. The prediction errors are then weighted with\ntheir precision before being assimilated at a high hierarchical level.\nGenerally speaking, predictive coding assumes that organisms minimize\nan upper bound on the entropy of sensory signals (the free energy),\nwhich, under certain simplifying (Gaussian) assumptions is equivalent\nto the prediction error. The minimization of the error-signal (at\nthe different hierarchical levels of a neural network) is generally\ncomputed through a generalized gradient descent \\cite{friston2010}.\nHence, predictive coding theory leads to model the brain activity\nby means of a \\emph{neural network} with multiple neuronal layers\n(from the top high hierarchical level, to the bottom sensory level)\nwhich is governed by the backpropagation algorithm \\cite{bishop2006};\nthis algorithm leads to the minimization of the error signal, adjusting,\niteratively, the weights of the prediction errors at different network\nlayers (such weights correspond to the precisions). In \\emph{machine\nlearning} and engineering fields artificial neural networks have been\nextensively applied to a large number of learning problems \\cite{bishop2006}\n(for classification, regression or parameters estimation). Hence through\na neural network architecture, in principle, any nonlinear function\nor distribution can be learned. Predictive coding theory and the above\nmentioned concepts have been succesfully applied to perception \\cite{Friston2008}\nand motion (action) learning (the so called \\emph{active inference}\ntheory; \\cite{friston2009,friston2010}) to communication learning\n\\cite{Friston2015}; moreover, a predictive coding version of interoception\n(i.e., a model for the autonomic, metabolic, immunological regulations\nso, generally speaking, for homeostasis and allostasis, and, potentially,\neven for emotional regulations) has been proposed in \\cite{Barrelt2015,Pezzulo2015,Seth2013}.\nNonetheless, we will show (see Section \\ref{sub:diff_interoception})\nthat the interoceptive predictive coding model, which could hold for\ninteroceptive visceromotor functions (i.e., homeostasis and allostasis),\ncannot be directly applied to implicit emotional learning, since it\nwould lead to the instability of the emotional system.\n\n\n\\subsection{A new model for error-based emotional learning\\label{sub:General-hypothesis}}\n\nIn the following an error-based mathematical model for describing\nthe dynamics of implicit emotional learning is developed. The main\nfeatures of the proposed model, and its similarities and differences\nwith the models mentioned at the end of Section \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional}\nare summarised below.\n\n\\emph{A model for primary stimulus learning} - The proposed model\ndescribes the implicit learning of a UCS outcome (i.e., the UCS acquisition,\ninflation and devaluation: the UCS revaluation) and, consequently,\ndoes not immediately refer, unlike the classical conditioning models\n(like the Rescorla-Wagner and TD models), to the learning of the associative\nconnection between a UCS and a paired CS \\cite{Rescorla1974}. Further\ndetails about this are provided in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-learning},\nwhere the relationship between these two learning mechanisms is analysed\nin detail. \n\n\\emph{Implicit emotional evaluation} - In the development of our model\nit is assumed that no cognitive or suggestion processes occur during\nthe interactions between a subject and the considered UCS; for this\nreason, our attention focuses on only \\emph{implicit} (or automatic)\nemotional evaluation (in other words, information such as verbal suggestions,\ncognitive expectations, beliefs and so on, are avoided). Nevertheless,\nthe source of stimulation has to brought to the attention of the subject.\nIn particular it has to be evident that the UCS is responsible for\nthe response elicitation, so that the outcome will be correctly attribuited\nto that source. This assumption exludes the situation in which the\noutcome is misattribuited to another insignificant stimulus \\cite{Bryant2003a,Cotton1981,Jones2009,Uleman1987},\nor even not attributed (like in the case of hidden drug administration).\nFurthermore, the stimulus remains unchanged in the sequence of trials.\nUnder such assumptions, without any loss of generality, it can be\nassumed that the predicted response (i.e., the expected outcome) in\na given trial, for the given stimulus, will coincide with the response\nexperienced during the last source-subject interaction. Such an assumption\nsimplifies the following mathematical computations and does not lead\nto any loss of the generality, since, generally speaking, one might\neven assume that the predicted outcome converges during trials (or\nduring time) to the real experienced outcome through a learning mechanism.\nIn the latter case the convergence of the emotional response towards\na steady state will simply be slower.\n\n\\emph{Multidimensional nature of the error-signal and evaluation of\na single component} - As already mentioned in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error},\na mathematical representation based on multidimensional vectors should\nbe adopted to properly describe the error signal involved in emotional\nlearning and defined as the difference between the actually perceived\nresponse and its expected counterpart; this is due to the fact that\nmultiple (and specific) emotional components could be elicited by\na primary stimulus. However, in the following we focus on the dynamics\nof a \\emph{single component} to ease the reading. This choice, however,\ndoes not entail any loss of generality, since our model can be applied\nto any component.\n\n\\emph{Indistinguishability between the emotional component of an active\nresponse and the corresponding reactive learned response} - As illustrated\nin Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error}, a learned reactive\nresponse mimics the emotional components of the active response elicited\nby a primary stimulus. For this reason, we assume that the reactive\nand the active responses add up, so generating the emotional component\n$\\mathbf{y}_{em}$ (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:em-ne-components}) and Remark\n\\ref{rem:Ii+Ie}). \n\n\\emph{The essential neural network and the related neural functions}\n- The considered error signal is computed by a distribuited and dynamically\ninterconnected neural network whose master element is supposed to\nbe the OFC (see Sections \\ref{sub:Error-signals-in_emotional_learning}\nand \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional}). This error-signal is transmitted\nby the network to the amygdala, which, in turn, updates the emotional\nreactive response associated with the representation of the primary\nstimulus. The processing of the error signal inside the amygdala is\nrepresented by the (unknown) \\emph{amygdala function}, denoted $F_{A}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$\nin the following. \n\nAs already discussed in Section \\ref{sub:amygdala-role}, whenever\na primary stimulus is perceived, the amygdala elicits the reactive\nresponse previously coded for that stimulus. In particular, the amygdala\nis be able to arouse the cortex, and the emotional and motivational\nbrain regions directly and indirectly; this process involves the \\emph{system\nchain} described in Section \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional} and\noperating between the amygdala output and the emotional brain systems.\nIn the proposed model, the biological functionality of this\\emph{\nsystem chain} is described by the (unknown) \\emph{system chain function\n$F_{Ch}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$}. Note that this function does not lend\nitself to a simple description, since it is influenced by iterative\nmechanisms involving neuronal and hormonal systems, and various brain\nregions. In practice, $F_{Ch}(\\cdot)$ represents the processing which\nturns all the amygdala output signals into emotional and motivational\nresponses. These ideas are summarised in Fig. 3, which shows the functional\nrepresentation proposed for the implicit emotional learning system.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\noindent \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics{figure3}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\caption{Discrete-time representation of the mechanisms on which the implicit\nemotional learning system is based. The functional connections between\nthe involved actors and the processing task accomplished by each block\nare shown. In particular, a stimulus could exert an active stimulation,\na reactive stimulation or both; in case of a reactive stimulation,\nthe stimulus is perceived and, successively, the amygdala elicits\nthe associated reactive response. The amygdala output is being processed\nby the system chain network, which involve all the systems between\nthe amygdala output and the emotional/motivational brain regions (e.g.,\nthe nucleus accumbens, the sympathetic system, the hypothalamus and\nothers). The orbitofrontal cortex updates the expected response associated\nto a given stimulus and drives the error computation network for the\ncomputation of the emotional error signals. The error signals are\nsent to the amygdala which updates the reactive responses associated\nto the given stimulus. The processes involved in the discrete-time\nemotional system are discuss in detail in the following sections.}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\emph{Functional approximations} - Generally speaking, the functions\n$F_{A}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ and $F_{Ch}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ may change\nover time, and are expected to be influenced by the internal physiological\nstates at the time the stimulus is encountered \\cite{Toates1986,Cabanac1992,Dickinson1994,Balleine1998},\nexternal circumstances and various features of the eliciting stimulus.\nMoreover, it is expected that the amygdala function depends also on\nthe elicited sensory modality (e.g., auditory, visual, olfactory).\nFinally, the behavior of these functions change from component to\ncomponent. However, in the following it is always assumed, for simplicity,\nthat these functions are static; consequently, the influence of all\nthe above mentioned factors and possible habituation effects are not\ntaken into consideration. Moreover, their dependence on the considered\nemotional component is not highlighted by the adopted mathematical\nnotation since, as already mentioned above, we focus on a single emotional\ncomponent.\n\n\n\\section{A novel discrete-time dynamic model for the implicit acquisition\n(and inflation) and devaluation (and extinction) of an emotional source\\label{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}}\n\nIn this Section the discrete-time dynamic models for \\emph{implicit\nemotional learning} during the \\emph{source acquisition} (and \\emph{inflation})\nand \\emph{devaluation }\\cite{Rescorla1974,Schultz2013,Gottfried2004}\n(and extinction) are developed. In particular, the source acquisition\nrepresents the process through which an emotional source of stimulation\n(i.e., UCS) is detected and coded within the brain; the inflation\n(devaluation), instead, represents the process through which an UCS\noutcome (i.e., an UCR) increases (decreases) with respect to the previously\ncoded UCR. At the beginning of our study some additional hypotheses\nneeded in the development of our model (and complementing the hypotheses\nillustrated in Section \\ref{sub:General-hypothesis}) are listed and\nproperly motivated, and some details about the adopted mathematical\nnotation are provided.\n\n\n\\subsection{Additional hypothesis and mathematical notation\\label{sub:specific_hyp_discrete}}\n\nUnless explicitly stated, the following hypotheses hold in the development\nof our model.\n\nH.1 - \\emph{Discrete trials} - Multiple trials in the interaction\nbetween a source and a subject are considered; the trial duration\n$\\triangle T$ is assumed to be relatively small and, in particular,\nnegligible with respect to the \\emph{inter-trial interval }(ITI) $T$.\nFor this reason, each trial can be ideally associated with a specific\npoint on the time axis and the corresponding emotional response can\nbe deemed constant, so that a \\emph{discrete time scale }\\cite{Bohner2001}\ncan be adopted in the representation of the considered phenomena.\n\nH.2 - \\emph{Residual response from previous trials} - The time constant\n$\\tau$ associated with the decay of the response elicited during\neach trial is deemed negligible respect to the inter-trial interval\n$T$; consequently, when a new trial takes place, the emotional response\ndue to the previous trials has already vanished.\n\nH.3 - \\emph{Novelty of the} \\emph{source of stimulation} - The stimulus\neliciting the emotional response is assumed to be neutral before the\nstart of the trials (e.g., it is not a phylogenetic innate source\nof stimulation). \n\nH.4 - \\emph{Stimulus perception} - The perceived stimulus is the same\nin each trial, so as the associated contextual information and boundary\nconditions. This assumption states that, if a stimulus elicits a subject\nduring the first trial in a specific context (e.g., place, timing,\nand specific boundary conditions), it has to be considered that the\n\\emph{stimulus perception} in the following trials involves exactly\nthe same contextual and boundary conditions. In the absence of such\nan assumption the reactive response elicited by the stimulus perception\nmight be modulated by the different contextual information and boundary\nconditions. For instance, the perception of a threatening stimulus\n(e.g., a snake) at a short distance and without barriers should elicit\na reactive response stronger than that due to the same stimulus perceived\nat a larger distance or in the presence of a separation barrier (i.e.,\nwith different boundary conditions and context).\n\nH.5 - \\emph{Response evolution} - During the process of source acquisition,\nthe emotional response increases monotonically over successive trials;\nthis assumption is motivated by the definition of acquisition and\nconsolidation of a source stimulus (hence, the extinction or de-valuation\nprocesses are not taken into consideration in this case). On the contrary,\nduring the process of source devaluation or extinction, a monotonical\ndecrease of the emotional response is observed.\n\nH.6 - \\emph{Stability of the emotional system} - The emotional response\ndoes not diverge (i.e., does not tend to infinity) as the number of\ntrials increases. \n\nIn our analysis the following mathematical notation is adopted. The\nemotional response and the active emotional component characterizing\nthe $n$-th trial are denoted $y_{n}$ and $x_{n}$, respectively\n(note that these quantities correspond to the terms $\\mathbf{y}_{em}$\nand $\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$, respectively, in Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})), where\n$n$ is the trial index (with \\emph{$n=1,2,...$}). In principle,\nthe dependence of $y_{n}$ and $x_{n}$ (and that of the amygdala\nfunction $F_{A}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$ and of the corresponding system\nchain function\\emph{ $F_{Ch}\\left(\\cdot\\right)$}; see the last part\nof Section \\ref{sub:General-hypothesis}) on the emotional space component\nthey refer to should be indicated; in the following, however, such\na dependence is omitted to ease the reading.

This phenomenon, which consists in the possibility\nof experiencing a conditioned response some time after a complete\nconditioned extinction, cannot be described in terms of the Rescorla-Wagner\nmodel \\cite{Miller1995}. Moreover, we argue that the passive residual\nresponse due to a contrast effect (e.g., an inhibitory response due\nto the lack of an expected UCS elicitation) is able to counteract\nthe effect of a residual conditioned Pavlovian response, which, in\nturn, it can not be detected. For this reason, after the dissipation\nof a contrast passive response, the conditioned reflex can be observed\nagain. Our viewpoint is partially supported by the fact that spontaneus\nrecovery is stronger when conditioning extinction occurs through massed\ntrials (i.e., in the presence of a small ITI, which are known to enhance\ncontrast effects) and weaker when extinction occurs through widely\nspaced trials (i.e., in the presence of a larger ITI which determines\na smaller contrast effect) \\cite{Urcelay2009}.\n\n\n\\section{Misattribution of a source of stimulation and evaluative conditioning\\label{sec:Misattribution-of-a}}\n\nWhen a source of emotional stimulation elicits a subject, the process\nof encoding emotional memory starts; this involves various interactions\nbetween the amygdala and the hippocampus \\cite{Richardson2004}. This\nencoding results in the processing and storage of different pieces\nof information, such as contextual information, the elements determining\ninternal states and the elicited response. Generally speaking, the\nhippocampus (and, in particular, the \\emph{dentate gyrus}, DG) encodes\ncontextual information, whereas the BLA encodes emotional valence\nand unconditioned stimulus representation \\cite{Gore2015,Redondo2014}.\nThe encoding of emotional memory requires that the source of stimulation\nis correctly detected and attributed. When an emotional response due\nto a source of stimulation is attributed to a wrong source, an event\nof \\emph{source misattribution }occurs (e.g., see \\cite{Bryant2003a,Cotton1981,Jones2009},\nand references therein). Note that misattributions may result either\nfrom conscious, accessible and measurable controlled processes, or\nfrom spontaneous, inaccesible, automatic processes \\cite{Anderson1989,Uleman1987}.\nIn the last case this phenomenon is called \\emph{implicit misattribution}\n(e.g., see\\emph{ }\\cite{Anderson1989,Hutter2013,Uleman1987}).\n\nA quantitative description of the source misattribution phenomena\ncan be developed on the basis of our dynamic model; moreover, the\nnew results about this topic shed new light on the problem of \\emph{evaluative\nconditioning} (EC). Both these issues are illustrated in the remaining\npart of this Section.\n\n\n\\subsection{Source misattribution: a quantitative analysis\\label{sub:Source-Misattribution:-quantitat}}\n\nLet us focus again, like in the previous Section, on multiple trials\nof the interaction between a given aource and a subject and assume\na discrete-time scale in our analysis. In a generic trial one of the\nfollowing mutually exclusive events might happen: 1) the elicited\nresponse is correctly attributed to the source of stimulation, so\nthat the emotional reactive response is computed and coded according\nto Eq. (\\ref{eq:recursive-2}); 2) no source of stimulation is identified\nand, consequently, no reactive response is encoded and associated\nwith the source; 3) the elicited response is misattributed to another\n(others) source(s) of stimulation. In the following we focus on the\nlast event and assume, without any loss of generality, that the misattributed\nsource of stimulation is initially \\emph{neutral} (i.e., it does not\nelicit an active or a reactive emotional response). Actually, this\nevent encompasses the following three mutually exclusive cases: \n\na) The misattribution occurs in the presence of an active response;\nfor instance, this occurs when an hidden active source of stimulation\n(e.g., the hidden administration of a given drug able to elicit an\nemotional component) is misattributed to another insignificant source\nof stimulation. \n\nb) The misattribution occurs in the presence of a residual (i.e.,\npassive) response decay only (in other words, no active or reactive\nresponses are elicited); in this case the misattribution trial follows\nthe elicitation trial and occurs during the excitation decay.\n\nc) The misattribution occurs when a purely reactive source of stimulation\nis eliciting the subject, so that the associated response is purely\nreactive.\n\nIf the misattributed source of stimulation is not neutral but elicits\na response, the response elicited during the misattribution process\nwill result from the superposition of the actual source response with\nthe previous non-attributed emotional state \\cite{Zillmann1971}.\nFor this reason, in this case the previous non-attributed emotional\nstate ``energizes'' the actual source. \n\nIn the following the above mentioned three cases are analysed in the\nframework of the dynamical model developed in the previous Section;\nmoreover, it is assumed that misattribution always occurs in the first\ntrial and that the previous reactive response is equal to zero (i.e.,\n$y_{0}=0$).\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Case a): Misattribution occurring in the presence of an active response.}\n\nIn this case, the response in the first trial is only due to the active\ncomponent (i.e., to $X$; see Eq. (\\ref{eq:recursive-2})) elicited\nby a non-attributed source of stimulation (e.g., an hidden administered\ndrug). Consequently, the error signal in the first trial, denoted\n$e_{1}$, is equal to $X$ and the corresponding reactive component\n(expressed by $\\alpha\\cdot X$) is coded for the new misattributed\nsource of stimulation. If the original (i.e., true) source of stimulation\nceases to actively elicitate the subject in the following trials (i.e.,\nthe physical active component becomes zero), a negative error signal\nis computed. In this case, after repetitive expousures of the misattributed\nsource without active elicitation, the emotional response asymptotically\ntends to zero (according to a mathematical law similar to that expressed\nby Eq. (\\ref{eq:solution-d-e}). \n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Case b): Misattribution occuring in the presence of a decaying residual\nresponse only.}\n\nThis case is known in literature as \\emph{transfer paradigm} (described\nin the Hullian \\emph{drive theory} \\cite{Hull1943}) or \\emph{excitation\ntransfer} \\cite{Bunce1993,Zillmann1971,Zillmann1972}, and refers\nto the influence of a prior episode of arousal on subsequent emotional\nresponses. In this case, since environmental cues about the actual\nsource of a residual arousal are missing, such an arousal is misattributed\nto a subsequent stimulus; this may result in an intensification of\nthe subject's emotional response to the new stimulus (see \\cite{Bunce1993}\nand references therein). In this case, in the first trial the registered\nresponse is due to a passive (residual) response only, which is denoted\n$\\xi$ in the following. Consequently, the error $e_{1}$ in the first\ntrial is equal to $\\xi$ and the reactive response stored for the\nmisattributed source is equal to $\\alpha\\cdot\\xi$. Moreover, if the\nsubject is elicited by the misattributed source in a successive trial,\nthe corresponding reactive response is given again by $\\alpha\\cdot\\xi$,\nwhich is smaller than what was expected for that source (i.e., $\\xi$),\nso that a negative error signal is computed. Therefore, if further\ntrials occur, the emotional response asymptotically tends to zero,\nsimilarly as in the previous case. \n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Case c): Misattribution occurring in the presence of a purely reactive\nsource of stimulation eliciting the subject.}\n\nIn this case, the response in the first trial (when the misattribution\nis occuring), called $i_{U}$, is due to a purely reactive response\nelicited by another unrevealed source (e.g., a subliminal emotional\nstimulation \\cite{Esteves1994,Glascher2003,Mayer1999}). Hence, the\nresponse attributed to the new source (because of the misattribution)\nis equal to $i_{U}$, which, in this case, is exactly what the amygdala\nis eliciting, so that the error $e_{1}$ in the first trial is equal\nto zero (i.e., the elicited response coincides with the expected response).\nHence, during the second trial, the expousure to the new source determines\nthe reactive response elicited by the amygdala during the first trial\n($i_{U}$); furthermore, since the contribution due to the error signal\nis equal to zero, the overall response remains equal to $i_{U}$.\nFor the same reason, the response remains constant during the successive\ntrials. These results, that hold if habituation or \\emph{mere exposure\n}phenomena \\cite{zajonc_mere_2001} are neglected, show that an inextinguishable\n(i.e., not vanishing through repetitive trials of source perception)\nreactive response can be obtained through a complete misattribution\nof a purely reactive emotional response. Note that, generally speaking,\na source of stimulation is expected to elicit an active component\ntoo, and when this active component is no longer present, a negative\nerror signal drives the response extinction through repetitive expousures,\nas illustrated in the Section \\ref{sub:Quantitative-analysis-d-e}.\nOn the contrary, our mathematical results show that, if the stored\nresponse associated with a stimulus is purely reactive (i.e., no active\ncomponent is expected), the error signal is equal to zero in each\ntrial, because the reactive response corresponds to the expected response;\nfor this reason, no updating of the emotional reactive response occurs.\nA concrete example of such effect is the EC through \\emph{implicit\nmisattribution} \\cite{Hutter2013,Jones2009} (see Section \\ref{sub:Evaluative-conditioning}).\n\nLet us define now a \\emph{non-active stimulus }as a stimulus eliciting\na reactive (or null) response only; given this definition, our main\nfinding can be summarised in the following corollary.\n\n\\emph{{\\textsc{{Corollary 1}}}}\n\n\\emph{If a purely reactive emotional response is attributed to a non-active\nstimulus, this stimulus becomes a resistant-to-extinction source of\nreactive emotional stimulation.}\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\\emph{Corollary} 1 allows us to justify the inextinguishability of\nEC due to\\emph{ }implicit misattribution (see \\cite{Hutter2013,Jones2009}\nand references therein), and could suggest a mechanism for other forms\nof resistant-to-extinction responses. In practice, through the repeated\napplication of Corollary 1, in each misattribution stage the reactive\nresponse is given by the \\emph{sum} of the previous reactive responses\nevoked by the considered stimulus (because of the resistant-to-extinction\nnature of the reactive stimulus itself) with the actual misattributed\nreaction (in other words, the reactive response is \\emph{cumulative}).\nThis could explain why an emotional additive increase can be obtained\nnaturally in every day life through the so called \\emph{incubation\neffect} \\cite{book_traumatic2012,Davey1989} (note that even a summation\nof different reactive sources could be misattributed to one single\ntarget stimulus). More specifically, some neurotic individuals can\nrehearse a trauma in their minds, or people can misattribute some\nbackground emotional states (such as mood and others irrilevant and\ndisconnected emotional events) forward a target stimulus, which, in\nturn, becomes able to elicit a stronger arousal at every misattribution\nor rumination stage \\cite{Davey1989}. \n\nFurthermore, Corollary 1 provides theoretical basis for the develpment\nof purely reactive emotional stimuli: in principle, an additive and\na resistant-to-extinction emotional reaction can be obtained in a\ncontrolled environment, through repetitive interactions between a\nsubject, a non-detectable reactive emotional source (the misattributed\nsource) and a target stimulus (to be attributed). In practice, a confounding\nsource (or a compound of confounding sources) of reactive stimulation\ncould elicit a subject in the presence of a target stimulus, which\nhas to become the attributed source of stimulation. Moreover, through\nrepetitive elicitations, the target stimulus is expected to produce\nan inextinguishable and increasing reactive response. One method to\nobtain a compound of confounding reactive sources is to develop a\nsubliminal masked expousure of an emotional and sufficently strong\naroused stimulus \\cite{Flykt2007,Morris1998,Morris1999,Ohman1993,Ohman1994},\nwhile a target stimulus has to be clearly perceived by the subject.\nTo this aim the confounding reactive stimulus has to elicit the same\nemotional components as the target, in order to obtain the superposition\n(i.e., the algebraic sum) of multiple contributions, i.e. the process\nwe call \\emph{implicit accumulation effect}. We believe that further\nresearch activities are needed to understand how to construct and\noptimize a suitable target stimulus (which must be easily attribuitable\nby a subject in relation to the emotional induced response) and which\nsensory elements (e.g., tactile, visual or auditory elements) should\nbe included, in order to optimize the effect. Furthermore, it is important\nto consider that a misattribution mechanism requires that the response\nevoked by the UCS could feasibly have arisen from the target CS, so\nsome minimal degree of feature matching is a necessary condition;\nwithout it, source confusion (and misattribution) is unlikely to occur\n\\cite{Jones2009}.\n\nFinally, it is important to point out that a practical exploitation\nof our results could be represented by the development of novel methods\nto mitigate an undesired emotional reaction. In fact, in principle,\nan undesired reactive response could be weakened through the misattributed\nelicitation of an opposite valenced reactive response (for instance\nthe pain perception can be weakened through the stimulation with rewarding\nreactive stimulus, or it can enhanced through the stimulation with\nanxiety related or emotionally threatening reactive stimulus \\cite{Roy2009,Wagener2009,Wiech2009}),\nor through a reactive inhibition. This might represent a valid supporting\ntool for treating certain psychopathologies for which the mere exposure\ntreatment, even if coupled with drug administration, could fail to\nextinguish an undesired emotional reactive response (see Section \\ref{sub:reactive-versus-active}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Evaluative conditioning through implicit misattribution\\label{sub:Evaluative-conditioning}}\n\nAs already mentioned above, the EC phenomenon represents the formation\n(or change of the valence) of a stimulus, called CS, originating from\na prior pairing of the CS itself with another stimulus, called UCS\n\\cite{Baeyens1993,Gast2012,Hofmann2010,Houwer2001,Hutter2013,Jones2009};\nunlike Pavlovian conditioning, a CS response acquired through EC seems\nto be resistant to extinction \\cite{Baeyens2005}.\n\nIn recent years various research activities have been devoted to investigate\nthe role played in EC by the \\emph{awareness of contingencies} between\na CS and its paired UCS \\cite{Baeyens1992,Baeyens1993,Dawson2007a,Hutter2013,Ruys2009}.\nIn particular, experimental evidence illustrated in \\cite{Hutter2013}\nleads to the conclusion that the EC occurrence can be justified by\ndifferent mechanisms, like classical conditioning (and, consequently,\nthe awareness of CS-UCS contingencies) and implicit misattribution\n(in this case, awareness is not required). In the same reference it\nis also shown that sequential CS-UCS presentations are subject to\nUCS revaluation, retroactive inference from subsequent learning and\ncontingency awareness (these phenomena are typically related to classical\nconditioning); on the contrary, a simultaneous CS-UCS presentation,\nwhich, generally speaking, prevents awareness and facilitates the\nsource misattribution, can produce EC effects which are robust against\nall the factors mentioned above. Moreover, in \\cite{Jones2009} it\nis shown that, according to the implicit misattribution model, responses\nto UCSs can be misattributed without awareness to the CS, and that\nthe implicit misattribution depends on \\emph{source confusability},\nin other words the subject has to confuse which multiple coocuring\nstimuli in her environment is evoking the evaluative response. Furthermore,\nmanipulations of the variables related to the potential for the misattribution\nof an evaluation, (i.e., the source confusability) show that greater\nEC occurs with an higher degree of confusability \\cite{Jones2009}.\nHence, as already discussed in the previous Section, the inextinguishability\nof the CS valence in EC phenomena due to implicit misattribution can\nbe explained in terms of \\emph{Corollary }1; in other words, it is\nmotivated by the fact that the UCS (e.g., a reactive stimulus such\nas an emotional picture) behaves like a purely reactive source of\nstimulation, and the reactive outcome is attributed (at least partially)\nto the CS, so that the response stored and expected for that stimulus\nis purely reactive (see also the\\emph{ Case c} in the Section \\ref{sub:Source-Misattribution:-quantitat}\nfor the quantitative analysis). This result is also supported by Baeyens\nand colleagues \\cite{Baeyens1993}, who found that EC was not sensitive\nto the degree of statistical contingency between the CS and US, but\nEC should increased with the absolute number of pairings because each\nprovides an opportunity for misattribution, and such misattributions\ncould act cumulatively \\cite{Jones2009}. It is worth mentioning that\nEC could also be determined by other mechanisms, or by the combinations\nof different mechanisms \\cite{Jones2009}, such as, classical conditioning,\nthe formation of particular beliefs about the CS and\\emph{ conceptual\nrecategorization} of the CS \\cite{Jones2009}. \n\n\n\\section{Differences and relations between the implicit emotional model and\nthe predictive coding model\\label{sub:diff_interoception}}\n\nThe predictive coding (or active inference) version of interoception\n\\cite{Barrelt2015,Pezzulo2015,Seth2013}, described in Section \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional},\ncannot be applied to implicit emotional learning because the theorem\nderived in Section \\ref{sub:Theorem:-On-the}. In fact, since the\nprediction signal (which coincides with the reactive response in predictive\ncoding) and the active (bottom-up sensory) elicitation sum up, the\nprediction response would increase indefinitely over successive trials.\nOne might argue that the precision associated with the error signal\noriginating from the reactive (self-made) emotional response should\nbe reduced by attentional mechanisms, like in active inference in\nprimary motor cortex (M1), where the gain (or precision) associated\nwith the sensations originating from the self-made action are reduced\n\\cite{Barrelt2015,Shipp2013} (see also the \\emph{corollary discharge};\ne.g. \\cite{Crapse2008}). Nevertheless, this cannot occur within the\nemotional system, since, the reactive and the active emotional responses\nare indistinguishable and, for this reason, add up in algebraic sense,\nas shown by the experimental evidence described in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error}. \n\nDespite this, we argue that the predictive coding principle could\nbe applied under the assumption that different hierarchical neural\nnetworks operate in succession, and others in parallel, during implicit\nemotional learning. More specifically, if an active stimulus elicitates\na given subject, a first neural network, describing perception, determines\nwhich is the most probable stimulus responsible for the elicitation\n(i.e., the source attribution process) through the maximization of\nthe Bayesian posterior probability distribution (or the free energy\nminimization, which leads to the ``surprise'' or entropy minimization\n\\cite{friston2009,Friston2008}), then the network for the computation\nof the expected outcome (managed by the OFC) interacts with the network\nwhich computes the updating of the reactive responses (within the\namygdala). However, our model provides a system level representation\nof implicit emotional learning and, for this reason, the details about\nthe iterative computations (and messages passing) between neurons\nor between different neuronal hierarchical levels of the involved\nsignals (such as error signals, expected outcomes or reactive responses,\nand the neural computations leading to source attribution) are behind\nthe scope of our analysis. For instance, our system-level model assumes\nthat a distributed network computes error signals without entering\ninto the details of such a computation; hence, for example, our model\ncannot be account for phenomena or physiopathologies originating from\na defect in the error computation processes (such as a pathological\ndopamine system unable to properly compute the precisions associated\nwith the error signals). Nevertheless, our model can specifically\npredict phenomena and pathologies originating from system-level problems\n(in other words, it provides a macro-level perspective). Furthermore,\nour model does not describe the computations leading to source attribution,\ninstead it describes the effects originating from the cases in which,\nduring a stimulation, a stimulus is correctly attributed, misattributed\nor even not attributed. Finally, it is worth mentioning that an important\nsimilarity between the proposed implicit emotional learning model\nand the active inference model is represented by the fact that the\nbrain can experience a reactive stimulation (i.e., a prior bayesian\nbelief, in the active inference terminology) shaped by prior experiences\nand learning, even if the stimulus does not actively elicitate the\nsubject. However, it is important to stress out that in our model\nthe reactive response is differentiated from the expected outcome,\nwhich represents a value (more precisely a function over internal\nphysiological states) of the elicitation that the brain (OFC) expects\nto experience from a given UCS. In other words, expecting a given\nresponse does not coincide with the ``self-induction'' of that response\n(see the Theorem in Section \\ref{sub:Theorem:-On-the}). Furthermore,\na variation of the active (sensory or bottom-up) stimulation leads\nto an update or modulation of the expected outcome and of the reactive\nemotional response associated to the given stimulus.\n\n\n\\section{On the emotional learning in classical conditioning and UCS evaluation}\n\nIn this Section the intrinsic differences and the relations between\nthe mechanism of learning in classical conditioning and that previously\ndescribed for UCS revaluation learning are illustrated. Then, it is\nshown that the Rescorla-Wagner equation for classical conditioning\nrepresents an approximation of a specific case of emotional learning,\nsince it can be derived from our model, exploiting the stochastic\nHebbian plasticity rule \\cite{Amit1994,Fusi2002,Fusi2007,Soltani2006,Soltani2010}\nand taking into account specific approximations. \n\n\n\\subsection{Introduction\\label{sub:Introduction}}\n\nIn classical conditioning a CS, which is usually a neutral/innocuous\nstimulus like a sound or a neutral visual cue, is paired with a source\nof stimulation (e.g., an electric shock or food), which is called\nUCS. Through repeated CS-UCS pairings the CS can elicit a CR, called\n\\emph{unconditioned response} (UCR), which is often similar to the\nresponse aroused by the paired UCS \\cite{Fanselow2005,Kim2006,Pavlov1927}.\nWhen the UCS represents an aversive stimulus, the CS-UCS pairing phenomenon\nis called \\emph{Pavlovian fear conditioning} \\cite{Fanselow2005,Kim2006}.\nIn fear conditioning with humans, an indirect estimate of the autonomic\nCR can be obtained measuring the changes in \\emph{skin conductance\nlevel} (SCL), i.e. the so called \\emph{skin conductance response}\n(SCR). Note, however, that in the analysis illustrated in the previous\nsections, the UCR (i.e., the response elicited by a source of stimulation)\nis not simply represented by indirect measurements, such as SCR or\nthe degree of salivation \\cite{Pavlov1927}. In fact, it represents\nthe response associated with the brain neural populations elicited\nby the UCS and, consequently, includes both non-emotional and emotional\ncomponents. More specifically, the UCR consists of a reactive response\ncomponent ($\\mathbf{y}_{rem}$), a component due to the active (physical)\nstimulation of emotional brain areas ($\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$; see Eq.\n(\\ref{eq:2})) and a contribution due to non-emotional stimulation\n($\\mathbf{y}_{ne}$). For this reason, the SCR acquired during a specific\nUCS stimulation, like an electric shock delivery, represents only\nan indirect and correlated measure of the full response $\\mathbf{y}$\nexpressed by Eqs. (\\ref{eq:rappresentaz_base},\\ref{eq:em-ne-components}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Different emotional learning mechanisms: for a primary stimulus (UCS)\nand for a stimuli association (CS-UCS)\\label{sub:On-the-learning}}\n\nEven if both a CS and the paired UCS could be able to eliciting the\nsame emotional reaction under some circumstances, we argue they are\nqualitatively different entities and, most important, they might be\nlearned through independent mechanisms. In fact, on the one hand,\nthrough classical conditioning, which represents the learning of stimulus\ncontingencies, a CS acquires the capacity to elicit a response because\nit is able to signal a likely occurrence of the UCS elicitation. On\nthe other hand, during \\emph{implicit emotional learning }(or\\emph{\n}UCS evaluation)\\emph{,} an element acquires the capacity to elicit\na response because a \\emph{direct attribution} of the outcome forward\nthat element (i.e., the UCS). Furthermore, the UCS outcome revaluation\n(i.e., inflation and devaluation) is also driven by implicit emotional\nlearning.\n\nOur claims are supported by various results available in the literature\n\\cite{Davey1989,Gottfried2004,Hosoba2001,Rescorla1974,Schultz2013}.\nIn particular, \\cite{Rescorla1974}, on the basis of the results of\nvarious experiments in which inflation (UCR increase) is performed\nafter conditioning, came to the conclusion that organisms form memories\nof a given UCS independently of associative connections with a CS.\nFurthermore, in \\cite{Schultz2013} it is shown that the automatic\nresponse associated with a UCS (SCR) changes through the revaluation\nof the UCS itself in the absence of a variation in the probability\nof the CS-UCS contingency. In \\cite{Gottfried2004} it is shown that\na UCS inflation, even during trials of conditioning extinction, results\nin a larger CR. In \\cite{Davey1989}, starting from contemporary models\nof Pavlovian conditioning in humans, it is inferred that the processes\nof CS-UCS association and UCS revaluation may be largely independent.\nIn particular, UCS revaluation can be obtained in different ways (including\nverbal suggestions and cognitive processes) and this modifies the\nstrength of a CR in the absence of any change in stimulus contingencies.\nMoreover, in the experiment reported in \\cite{Hosoba2001} thirty\nsubjects were randomly assigned to the inflation (UCR increase) or\nthe deflation (UCR decrease) group, after a common classical conditioning\nacquisition procedure (i.e., after experiencing the same UCR strength).\nDuring the test session the indicators of the CR intensity were SCRs\nand subjective aversion to the conditioned stimulus (CS). The main\nresults obtained in that case can be summarized as follows: a) the\nCR strength measured by SCR was increased by the UCS inflation and\ndecreased by the UCS deflation; b) the subjective aversiveness to\nthe CS was not sensitive to both manipulations of the UCS intensity.\n\nAll the above mentioned results lead us to the following conclusions:\na) UCS revaluation occurs out of classical conditioning and, implicitly,\nis able to modify the CR; b) the strength of an autonomic CR might\nbe influenced by the subjective revaluation of a UCS, even when the\nCS-UCS contingency remains the same; c) the probability of a CS-UCS\ncontingency (i.e., the CS prediction of the occurrence of a UCS) through\nPavlovian conditioning is independent of the UCS revaluation. For\nthese reasons, the \\emph{UCS evaluation} (and revaluation) cannot\nbe described by classical conditioning, so that a specific model (i.e.,\na model for implicit emotional learning or UCS revaluation, like that\nillustrated in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}) is necessary.\nThese concepts are summarized in Fig. 4, where the CS representation\nis related to the UCS representation through a connection whose strength\nis proportional to the probability (or the \\emph{belief}) of stimulus\ncontingency, i.e. to the probability $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $\nof the UCS stimulation conditioned on the CS perception (briefly,\nthe CS-UCS contingency probability updated through the classical conditioning\nlearning). It is worth noting that the probability $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $\ncan be increased through repetitive CS-UCS pairings or reduced through\na CS exposition without UCS elicitation. These probability/belief\nupdatings reflects the CR during testing, according to the classical\nconditioning learning (e.g., through the results given by the Rescorla-Wagner\nequation \\cite{Rescorla1972}). Note also that, in Fig. 4 the connection\nbetween the UCS and the corresponding reactive response ($i_{R}$,\nsee Eqs. (\\ref{eq:function_amygdala}-\\ref{eq:Ii1})) is highlighted. \n\nThe schematic representation illustrated in Fig. 4 is in agreement\nwith various recent results available in \\cite{Redondo2014} and \\cite{Gore2015}.\nIn particular, the experimental results shown in \\cite{Redondo2014}\nhave evidenced that the hippocampal engram memory (which codes the\ncontextual CS) is neutral and could freely associate with either positive\nor negative emotions (through the UCS representation) coded within\nthe BLA. The connection between the contextual CS coded in the DG\nin the hyppocampus and the UCS coded within the BLA could also be\nswitched by optogenetic technology manipulation. In practice, a CS-UCS\nconnection (denoted CS-UCS \\#1) can be switched to another CS-UCS\nconnection (denoted CS-UCS \\#2) of opposite valence with respect to\nthe first one (e.g., from a fear emotional response to a reward emotional\nresponse). Indeed, the optogenetic reactivation of the DG engram-bearing\ncells during the presentation of a UCS having valence opposite to\nthe original one strengthens the connectivity of these DG cells with\na new subset of BLA neurons, while weakening the connections established\nduring the original learning \\cite{Redondo2014}. From these results\nit can be inferred that the CS memory engram is neutral and that a\nCS can elicit an emotional reaction through the connection to an UCS\nin the BLA. Additional results about the effects of optogenetic manipulation\nare illustrated in \\cite{Gore2015}, where it is shown that the projection\nof a CS representation onto a UCS ensemble in the BLA is required\nfor the expression of a learned behavior, and that a CS (e.g., auditory\nor olfactory) activates an UCS representation in the BLA to generate\na learned behavior. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\noindent \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics{figure4}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\caption{{\\footnotesize{}Schematic representation of the connections between\na CS, the paired UCS and the reactive response ($i_{R}$) associated\nwith the representation of the UCS itself. The reactive response $i_{R}$\nis determined by the UCS revaluation learning, instead the connection\nstrength between CS and UCS ($\\omega_{CS-UCS}$) is determined by\nclassical conditioning learning. Note that this schematic representation\nis in agreement with the experimental results shown in \\cite{Gore2015,Redondo2014}. }}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nOn the basis of our previous analysis we can state that a CS elicitation,\nin turn, arouses a UCS reactive response ($i_{R}$) through a probabilistic\n(or belief) connection; furthermore, the value of the associated probability\n(or \\emph{belief}) $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $ is determined by\nclassical conditioning (or even by optogenetic manipulations \\cite{Redondo2014}).\nFor instance, at the end of a conditioning acquisition, the probability\n$\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $ is close to unity, since a CS predicts\nalmost certainly the UCS ``imminent'' elicitation. In this case\na trial test produces a CR expressed by $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} \\cdot i_{R}\\simeq i_{R}$\nand, consequently, given by $i_{R}$, which represents the reactive\nresponse, determined by the amygdala reaction computed and stored\nwithin the amygdala itself for the considered UCS (see Eqs. (\\ref{eq:function_amygdala}-\\ref{eq:Ii1})).\nWhen the value of $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $ is between zero and\nunity, the CR can be computed, for instance, through the Rescorla-Wagner\nequation \\cite{Rescorla1972} and has to equal the product $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} \\cdot i_{R}$.\nTherefore, at the end of a conditioning acquisition process, there\nis no real difference, in terms of emotional reactive response, if\nthe subject perceives a CS alone or the paired UCS alone (note that\nthe term ``response'', and not ``behavior'', is adopted here,\nsince different intensities of the components of the same emotional\nresponse may lead to distinct observable behaviors; this issue is\ndiscussed in more detail below). This is exemplified by the case of\nthe dog observed at the end of a conditioned acquisition in the conditioning\nexperiments performed by \\cite{Pavlov1927}; in fact, as far as the\ndegree of salivation (i.e., the behavioral outcome due to the reactive\nresponse $i_{R}$) was concerned, perceiving the food (UCS) or perceiving\nthe bell (CS) which signalled the incoming food, did not really make\nany difference (at least during the first trial, before the eventual\nextinction process). Note that this does not mean that the CS becomes\na substitute of the UCS, as initially supposed by Pavlov in the so\ncalled ``\\emph{Stimulus-Substitution Theory}''\\cite{Chance2008},\nbut that the CS triggers the reactive response ($i_{R}$) through\nthe elicitation of the representation of the paired UCS within the\nBLA (such an UCS elicitation through the CS perception could be ``partial''\nor ``total'' depending of the CS-UCS connection strength; see Fig.\n4 and \\cite{Redondo2014}). In fact, as already stated in Section\n\\ref{sec:Response-representation}, a CR and the corresponding UCR\nare not identical, and only in specific conditions they could be similar\n(in addition, a UCR, unlike a CR, may involve an active component,\n$X$). In practice, the CR mimics the emotional components elicited\nby the corresponding UCR (see Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error}\nand Remarks \\ref{rem:Ii+Ie} and \\ref{rem:emotional_mimicking}) but,\ngenerally speaking, with a lower intensity, since the emotional system\nhas to be stable (i.e., $\\left|\\alpha\\right|<1$ is required; see\nH.6 in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}) and because the\nactive component ($X$) is no longer present in a purely reactive\nstimulation. These considerations could be useful to explain the fact\nthat, in specific circumstances, the CR might represent an opposite\nbehavioral response with respect to the original UCR; for instance,\none unconditioned response to morphine is represented by the reduced\nsensitivity to painful stimuli; however, the conditioned response\nto stimuli associated with morphine is represented by an increased\nsensitivity to painful stimuli \\cite{Siegel1975}. Phenomena like\nthis could be explained considering that, generally speaking, the\ndegree of elicitation of a neuronal population (or the quantity of\na specific type of released neurotransmitter), due to a CR is smaller\nthan the original one generated by the corresponding UCR (e.g., an\nactive morphine administration) because of the above mentioned reasons.\nIn particular, in neuropharmacology \\cite{Goodman2006} it is well\nknown that an \\emph{excitatory} effect is commonly observed with low\nconcentrations of certain \\emph{depressant} drugs (e.g., alcohol,\nmorphine, general anesthetics) because of either the depression of\ninhibitory systems or a transient increase in the release of excitatory\ntransmitters (note that an excitatory state occurs only with low concentrations\nof the depressant). Consequently, within the complex CNS structure,\ndifferent \\emph{doses} of a specific receptor agonist or of a specific\nneurotransmitter (i.e., different intensities of a specific component\nof a response) could lead to very different (even opposite) observable\nbehavioral responses (see \\cite{Goodman2006} for an exahustive review\nabout this topic). \n\nGenerally speaking, the typical scenario of a laboratory, where the\nUCS is represented by an electric shock device, which is permanently\nconnected to the subject who does not know when the electric shock\nwill be effectively delivered (unless signalled by the paired CS),\nleads to the impossibility of observing the emotional reactive response\n$i_{R}$ when the source of stimulation (i.e., the UCS electric shock\ndevice in the above mentioned scenario) is perceived by the subject.\nOn the contrary, we argue that, if the electric device is repeatedly\nconnected to the subject and disconnected from him/her in each trial\nof electric stimulation, the subject perception of the connected UCS\ndevice will elicit $i_{R}$ exactly as the CS perception does (after\na conditioned acquisition for the CS). One may argue that, in this\ncase, the CS is represented by the electric shock device and that\nthe electric shock delivery represents the UCS. Note, however, that\nin the considered scenario the device represents a primary source\nof direct stimulation (i.e., the UCS), whereas the shock delivery\nrepresents the physical elicitation of that source, which supports\nthe active elicited response (i.e., the term $X$, see Eq. (\\ref{eq:recursive-2}),\nor the term $\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$, see Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})). Note also\nthat the same considerations can be expressed when the primary stimulus\nis represented by food \\cite{Pavlov1927}, but do not hold for a neutral\nCS (e.g., a neutral sound) signalling the UCS, since, in the last\ncase, the CS cannot substain a direct physical stimulation. \n\n\n\\subsection{Conceptual difference between encoding a stimulus as a primary stimulus\n(UCS) or as a conditioned stimulus (CS)\\label{sub:Conceptual-difference-between} }\n\nAnother important issue related to the differences in the learning\nmechanisms analyzed in the previous Section concerns the regions of\nthe brain in which a CS and a UCS are memorised. If a contextual CS\nis considered, the CS engram and the the associated UCS are stored\nin the DG and in the BLA, respectively \\cite{Redondo2014}; however,\nit is still unclear if the same rule applies to any non-contextual\nCS. Note also that phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli, which are sources\nof stimulation according to the definition provided in Section \\ref{sub:Active-and-reactive},\nare natively stored in the mammial brain \\cite{Ohman1993,Ohman1994}. \n\nIn the following we summarise the most important experimental results\nwhich concern the \\emph{subliminal elicitation of} UCSs and the \\emph{failure\nin subliminal elicitation of ``previously-neutral'' conditioned\n}CSs. Then, some important conclusions about CS/UCS memorisation in\nspecific regions of the brain are inferred from them.\n\n\\emph{Subliminal elicitation of UCSs} - In various experiments accomplished\nby \u00d6hman \\emph{et al.} the awareness of visual stimuli was blocked\nby means of \\emph{backward masking} \\cite{Esteves1994,Ohman1998}.\nIn this case a target picture, representing a CS, is presented in\nan short interval (lasting less than 50 ms) and is followed by the\npresentation of a masking picture having similar luminosity and colour\nfeatures, and shown in the same area of the visual field \\cite{Enns2000}.\nThe presentation of this masking stimulus interrupts the cortical\nprocessing of the target stimulus \\cite{Noguchi2005,Rolls1999}; hence,\nthe target is invisible to the conscious and awareness of the subject\n\\cite{Kim2005}. Moreover, in these experiments snake- or spider-\nfearful subjects have been exposed to phylogenetic fear-relevant masked\nstimuli (snakes or spiders) and neutral masked stimuli (flowers and\nmushrooms). The acquired experimental results have evidenced that\nonly the phylogenetic stimuli were able to elicit an automatic SCR\nresponse in phobic patients \\cite{Ohman1994}. These findings agree\nwith the hypothesis about amygdala functionality proposed by LeDoux\n\\cite{LeDoux1996,LeDoux2000}. In fact, LeDoux has hypothized the\nexistence of a \\emph{thalamic pathway} to the amygdala; such a pathway\nwould allow to automatically detect evolutionary prepared visual stimuli\n(like emotional faces, spiders, snakes, injuries). Note that this\nmodel is also supported by other results acquired by different researchers\nthat have employed masking in normal participants \\cite{Liddell2004,Morris1999}\nor have observed brain activity in patients affected by cortical blindness\n\\cite{Gelder2006,Morris2001}. According to this model about amygdala\nfunctionality, the superior colliculus stimulates the pulvinar nucleus\nof the thalamus, which then arouses the amygdala \\cite{LeDoux2000,Ohman2005,Ohman2007}.\nThis mechanism is also supported by various brain imaging studies,\nwhich show that masked facial stimuli activate the amygdala exactly\nas masked pictures of threatening animals (such as snakes and spiders)\ndo \\cite{Ohman2005}. This suggests that the salient features representing\nan aversive source of stimulation could be stored in the amygdala. \n\n\\emph{Failure in subliminal elicitation of ``previously-neutral''\nconditioned} CSs - Other experimental results available in the literature\nhelp us to understand what happens when a previous neutral stimulus\n(i.e., a CS) conditioned on an active source of stimulation (i.e.,\nan UCS, like an electric shock) elicits a subject, and in particular,\nif the CS representation is stored in the same region as a phylogenetic\naversive stimulus. Note that, from a supraliminar perspective, both\na purely reactive UCS (e.g., a snake picture) and a previously conditioned\nCS (e.g., a neutral picture conditioned to an electric shock) are\nable to elicit a similar autonomic response, at least in subjects\nsuffering from a phobia towards the phylogenetic stimulus represented\non the exposed pictures \\cite{Ohman1994}. A more interesting case\nis that of subliminal perception, where only the sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala\npathway is elicited because of the backward masking procedure described\nabove. Various results, acquired by Ohman and Soares in experiments\nof \\emph{differential conditioning}, are available about this case\n\\cite{Ohman1993}. In these experiments, a neutral stimulus, denoted\nCS+ (e.g., flowers or mushrooms) was paired with an electric shock\nUCS (i.e., an active source of stimulation) during the acquisition\nphase, and a different neutral stimulus, denoted CS-, was presented\nin the absence of the UCS. The results acquired during the extinction\nphase have evidenced that the conditioned CS+ was able to elicit a\ndifferential response (in particular, an SCR response different from\nthe baseline level of the CS- response) only in the presence of supraliminar\nperception; on the contrary, no differential SCR response has been\nobserved in the case of masked perception. This means that, unlike\nthe case of a reactive UCS (such as spiders, snakes or angry faces),\nwhich is able to elicit an emotional reaction both through supraliminarly\nor subliminally perception \\cite{Ohman1994}, a previously neutral\nconditioned CS elicits an emotional response through supraliminar\nperception only. Therefore, the sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala pathway\n(i.e., the so called \\emph{high road} \\cite{LeDoux2000}) is unable\nto elicit a representation of the given CS; this representation, instead,\ncan be elicited only through the thalamus-cortex-amygdala pathway.\nThese considerarions lead us to the conclusion that a CS representation\nmight not be directly stored within the amygdala (or, in any case,\nnot in the same region as an UCS representation) even if it predicts\nan aversive-related stimulus. \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the same conditioning paradigms\nhave been used when employing biologically fear-related (phylogenetic)\nstimuli \\cite{Ohman1993}, angry faces \\cite{Esteves1994,Parra1997},\nand even ontogenetic pictures (i.e., pictures of cultural threats\nsuch as guns directed toward a subject) for CS+ and CS-. In all the\nseen experiments, even if the employed CSs were conditioned stimuli,\nthey were not neutral, since they represented reactive aversive emotional\nsources (i.e., reactive UCSs). This qualitative difference with respect\nto a neutral CS (i.e., to a CS not representing a reactive emotional\nsource) reflects the different behavioral results provided by the\nconsidered experiments and, in particular explains, the fact that,\neven during the masked extinction procedure, the CSs+ have been able\nto elicit an emotional response through the sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala\npathway. \n\nThe experimental results illustrated above have lead us to the following\nconclusions. It is likely that any representation of an emotional\nsource of stimulation, such as an innate biological fear-related threat\n(in other words, a phylogenetic source) or a cultural threat (i.e.,\nan ontogenetic source), is able to elicit an emotional response through\nthe sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala pathway; hence, this source is\nexpected to be stored in a \\emph{rapid access site} of the amygdala.\nOn the contrary, in the case of classical conditioning, a previously-neutral\nconditioned CS is unable to elicit a reactive emotional response through\nthe thalamic-amygdala pathway; consequently, it should be stored in\nother regions of the brain or in a region of the amygdala different\nfrom that employed for primary stimuli. Therefore, which is the qualitative\ndifference between a reactive UCS (e.g., an emotional picture) and\na previous neutral CS conditioned through classical conditioning?\nBoth UCS and CS are able to elicit similar responses supraliminarly,\nbut such stimuli are stored in different brain regions. We argue that\nthe main qualitative difference between these two cases is represented\nby how initially the stimulus has acquired the capacity to elicit\nan aversive emotional response, that is by how the stimulus has been\nencoded (as a primary stimulus or as a conditioned stimulus). In fact,\na phylogenetic source might be innate and natively stored within the\namygdala; moreover, an ontogenetic emotional source, such as a gun\n\\cite{Flykt2007}, might be acquired through learning mechanisms different\nfrom those of classical conditioning. It is reasonable to suppose\nthat a generic UCS, like an electric shock device or a weapon, is\nacquired through an active and direct stimulation (or even cognitively,\nexploiting aversive experiences of other individuals through social\nfear learning \\cite{Olsson2007,OlssonA2007}); consequently, the corresponding\noutcome will be directly \\emph{attributed} to that active source.\nIn brief, a UCS represents a stimulus able to directly elicit a response\n(i.e., it is encoded as a primary stimulus); on the contrary, a CS\ndoes not have such a capability and its role is limited to statistical\nsignalling of an incoming UCS. We also argue that the experiments\ndescribed above should also lead to similar conclusions if a new active\nsource of stimulation (i.e., an UCS which does not represent a phylogenetic\nthreatening stimulus nor an ontogenetic stimulus), experimentally\ngenerated, is adopted. In particular, the correctness of the last\nclaim could be assessed by modifying the experimental procedure described\nin \\cite{Flykt2007}; in particular, this would require the following\ntwo steps: a) introducing an additional phase in the experimental\nprocedure described in \\cite{Flykt2007}, in order to generate (starting\nfrom a neutral stimulus) a newly ontogenetic source of stimulation\nfor a group (through UCS evaluation), and a new conditioned stimulus\nfor another group (through classical conditioning learning); b) analyzing\nthe behaviors of the two different groups at the end of the learning\nprocedure. We expect to find out that both groups will be able to\nshow an emotional reaction (e.g., an SCR) through a supraliminar stimulus\nperception, whereas only the group who has encoded the stimulus as\na primary stimulus (i.e., as UCS) will be able to show an emotional\nreaction through subliminal perception (i.e., through the thalamo-amygdala\npathway). If such a result will be obtained, it will also definitively\nprove that the mechanism through which the aversive object has been\nencoded (i.e. through classical conditioning acquisition or by direct\nor implicit response attribution) makes the difference and determines\nthe brain region in which the stimulus representation will be stored.\n\nIn the absence of further experimental results, we believe, on the\nbasis of the existing literature, that the only reasonable claim that\ncan be made about the nature of a coded stimulus, is given by the\nfollowing remark.\n\\begin{rem}\n\\label{rem:UCS-in-amygdala}\n\\end{rem}\n\\emph{If a subliminally perceived cue elicits an emotional reaction,\nthen this means the cue representation is stored within the amygdala\nand it represents a source of emotional stimulation (i.e., an UCS).}\n\nNote that this remark is useful when analysing experimental results\nin which a subliminally perceived stimulus elicits a measurable emotional\nreaction. \n\n\n\\subsection{Derivation of the Rescorla-Wagner Equation for Classical Conditioning\nand a corrected formulation\\label{sub:Derivation-of-the}}\n\nIn this section it is shown how the Rescorla-Wagner equation for CS-UCS\nPavlovian conditioning can be derived starting from our model about\nthe implicit learning of an UCS outcome.\n\nOur derivation relies on the assumption that the CS-UCS synaptic connections\nare governed by the mechanisms of \\emph{stochastic Hebbian plasticity}\n\\cite{Amit1994,Fusi2002,Fusi2007,Hebb1949,Soltani2006,Soltani2010}.\nThis hypothesis is supported by both some experimental results shown\nin \\cite{Redondo2014} and \\cite{Gore2015}, and other models relying\non the fact that a CS-UCS pairing entails the Hebbian potentiation\nof the CS inputs onto the UCS representations in the BLA \\cite{Pape2010,Pickens2004,Sah2003}.\nIn practice, Hebbian learning is based on the idea that synapses between\nneurons being simultaneously active become stronger. Consequently,\n``neurons that fire together could wire together'' through an increase\nin synaptic efficacy mediated by \\emph{long term potentiation} (LTP,\nsee \\cite{Bliss1973}); on the contrary, a decrease in synaptic efficacy\nis mediated by \\emph{long term depression} (LTD) \\cite{Artola1990}.\nIn particular, in \\cite{Redondo2014} it is shown that the optogenetic\nreactivation of the DG engram-bearing cells coding a contextual CS,\nduring the presentation of a new UCS having valence opposite to the\noriginal UCS (which was previously paired with the CS itself), strengthens\nthe connectivity of these cells with a new subset of the BLA neurons,\nwhile weakening the connections established during the original learning\nprocess. In other words, the simultaneous activation of a CS neural\nrepresentation and of a new UCS strengthens a CS-UCS connection (through\nLTP) and, at the same time, weakens the connection (through LTD) between\nthe CS and the previously associated UCS, which is not simultaneously\nactive. \n\nAs illustrated in \\cite{Destexhe2004}, the main task of the sensory\nsystem is to detect (and model) correlations \\cite{Barlow1985} through\nneuron firing, in order to exploit \\textquoteleft suspicious coincidences\\textquoteright{}\nin complex incoming information. These correlations may form the \\textquoteleft objects\\textquoteright{}\nor \\textquoteleft features\\textquoteright{} of the representations\nof any stimulus. After being detected by primary sensory areas, such\ncorrelations can be used for binding elementary features into more\nelaborate percepts. These binding phenomena \\cite{Destexhe2004,Roskies1999}\nare based on the concept of neuronal assemblies, which are usually\ndefined as a group of neurons that transiently undergo synchronous\nfiring \\cite{Destexhe2004,Hebb1949}. This transient synchrony could\nform the basis of a common input to later stages of integration, and\nso promote responses that are specific to a given ensemble of features\n\\cite{Engel2001}. These mechanisms rely on the fact that cortical\nneurons are very efficient at detecting correlations \\cite{Abeles1991},\nas evidenced by computational models \\cite{Rudolph2001}. On the basis\nof these results it can be assumed that that the representation of\na CS and that of its associated UCS are formed by a \\emph{neuronal\nassembly}, which, in turn, is composed by cells assemblies representing\nspecific features, and that connections between the CS and the UCS\nneuronal assemblies are established through Hebbian plasticity. The\nimplications of this assumption are analysed in the following part\nof this Section, where a new sequence of trials, involving CS-UCS-subject\ninteractions, is taken into consideration.\n\nIn these trials we assume that: a) the source of stimulation (UCS)\nhas been acquired (i.e., properly coded as a source stimulus), and\nthe emotional learning for the UCS source has encoded the reactive\nresponse $i_{R}$ (which can be assumed to be equal to $\\alpha\\cdot X$,\nwith $X$ representing the active induced response); b) a new cue\n(denoted CS) becomes paired with the source UCS in the first trial\nand, hence, an UCR associated with this UCS is elicited; c) in the\nfirst trial (i.e., for $n=1$) the strength $\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(1)}$\n(ranging from 0 to 1, as evidenced below) of the CS-UCS connection\n(which, in turn, is related to $i_{R}$; see Fig. 4) is equal to zero\n(in other words, no connection has been established before the start\nof the pairing process); d) the CS remains the same during all the\nconsidered trial; e) the UCS elicitation is signalled by the CS presentation\nonly and not by the UCS presentation (e.g., the electric shock device\nis permanently attached to the subject and the shock delivery is signalled\nexclusively by the CS presentation). In the following analysis the\nresponse elicited by the CS, previously named CR, is denoted $y_{CS}$.\nThen, in the first trial, an unexpected active UCS elicitation ($X$)\ngenerates the emotional response (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:solution-decomposition-d-a}))\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 91452, "prevtext": "\nand is attributed to the UCS. Furthermore, depending on the value\nexpected for the UCS before the unexpected elicitation, the error\nsignal is computed and the reactive response associated with the UCS\nis updated accordingly; in particular, if the expected response before\nthe unexpected elicitation is equal to $X+\\alpha X$, the error signal\nbecomes $e=X\\cdot(K-\\alpha)$. Moreover, if another unexpected UCS\nelicitation occurs, the resulting error signal is equal to zero since\nthe expected outcome (which coincides with the last outcome) is now\nequal to the actually experienced outcome, which is given by $X+K\\cdot X$\n(i.e., the active elicitation and the contrast contribution due to\nthe unexpected elicitation). This mathematical result is important\nbecause shows that a series of trials of unexpected UCS elicitations\nlead to an error signal different from zero only during the first\nunexpected elicitation, in fact, in the successive unexpected trials\nthis leads to a static situation in which the error signal remains\nequal to zero and a constant reactive contribution (i.e., $K\\cdot X$)\ndue to the contrast effect is elicited. \n\nMoreover, if the Eq.

However, since the\nUCS occurs unexpectedly in time, a reactive contribution due to the\n\\emph{contrast effect} (see Section \\ref{sub:contrast-effect}) should\nbe produced (provided that no previous conditioned cue or direct UCS\nperception signals the active stimulation). Nevertheless, in Section\n\\ref{sub:contrast-effect} it has been shown that successive unexpected\nUCS elicitations do not entail the computation of an error signal,\nbut certainly involve the elicitation of a reactive response due to\nthe contrast effect, (quantified by the product $K\\cdot X$). However,\nwithout any loss of generality, this reactive contribution can be\nneglected; furthermore, it can be noted that, during conditioning\ntrials, this contrast contribution will vanish (since no ``unexpected\nstimulation'' occurs as the CS becomes progressively able to predict\nthe UCS occurrence) and in place of this contribution the reactive\nresponse associated with the UCS ($i_{R}$) will be elicited as the\nCS is perceived (see Fig. 4). Even if no error signal has to be estimated\nfor the given UCS source during the first trial, the contemporary\npresence of the CS during the UCS elicitation is sufficient to generate\nsome synaptic connections between the representation of the CS and\nthat of the UCS through the stochastic Hebbian rule; consequently,\nthe strength of this link is potentiated through LTP. In the following\nit is also assumed that individual plastic synapses exhibit a binary\nbehavior, since they can be in a \\emph{depressed state} or in a \\emph{potentiated\nstate}. For this reason, the strength of a set of plastic synapses\nis quantified by the fraction of synapse population in the potentiated\nstate \\cite{Amit1994,Fusi2002,Fusi2007,Soltani2006,Soltani2010};\nthis fraction is called \\emph{synaptic strength} and in the $n$-th\ntrial is denoted as $\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n)}$ for the set of synapses\nfrom the neurons representing the CS stimulus onto the encoding neurons\nfor the UCS. \n\nThe mechanism through which plastic synapses learn cue-outcome contingencies\nthrough stochastic reward-dependent Hebbian modifications is illustrated\nin \\cite{Soltani2010}. In practice, whenever the neurons encoding\na given CS are simultaneously elicited at the activation of the UCS\nneurons, the plastic synapses from CS onto UCS in the depressed state\nmake a transition to the potentiated state with probability $\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}$\n(this quantity is called \\emph{potentiation rate}); otherwise, if\nthe CS is elicited without the contingent UCS elicitation, they make\na transition in the reverse direction with probability $\\hat{\\alpha}_{-}$\n(this quantity is called \\emph{depression rate}). It is worth mentioning\nthat the parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_{-}$ are\nofter called \\emph{learning rates} \\cite{Soltani2006} and that they\ndepend on the firing rate of the postsynaptic neurons of the CS and\non the state of the UCS (which is either active or non-active, that\nis eliciting or not eliciting UCS). The firing rate is low for the\nneurons which do not represent the perceived CS and, on the contrary,\nis high for the neurons encoding the CS. Hence, if the CS features\nare modified during the trials, the learning rates change too. In\nthe following, however, we assume that the CS perception does not\nchange during the trials (see H.4 in Section \\ref{sub:specific_hyp_discrete}),\nso that the depression and potentiation rates remain constant (and\ndifferent from zero). It is worth pointing out that the parameters\n$\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_{-}$ are scalar quantities\n(each of them would be replaced by a vector having identical components\nif multiple emotional components were considered in the evaluation\nof the reactive response) and they are not related to the parameter\n$\\alpha$ defined in Section \\ref{sub:Quantitative-analysis-d-a}\n(i.e., $\\alpha$ becomes also a vector, but with different components,\nif multiple emotional components are taken into consideration). \n\nOn the basis of the plastic probabilistic Hebbian rule illustrated\nabove, in the $n$-th trial the synaptic strenght is updated as\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 147532, "prevtext": "\n\n\nFurthermore, if it is assumed that $x_{n}=X$ for every trial (see\nEq.(\\ref{eq:recursive-1})), the asymptotic solution for the Eq.

This last result is motivated\nby the fact that during successive trials the contrast effect decreases,\nsince the expected outcome (which is signalled by the UCS perception\nbefore the UCS active elicitation) approaches the experienced outcome\n(i.e., both the error signal and the actual error signal tend to zero\nover successive trials). Note also that the contrast effect could\nbe negative, for instance, if the experienced outcome is smaller than\nits expected counterpart a response inhibition occurs. For this reason,\nif the active elicitation $x_{n}$ drops to zero, the response decreases\nfaster than in the case in which no contrast is considered, since\nthe term $\\left(\\alpha+K\\alpha-K\\right)$ in the second side of Eq.\n(\\ref{eq:acq-contrast-d-approx}) is smaller than $\\alpha$ (see Eq.\n(\\ref{eq:final_d_a})).\n\nFinally, we argue that, if the \\emph{contrast effect} and the effect\nof the \\emph{excitation decay} are included in our discrete-time model\n(see also the classical conditioning model in Section \\ref{sub:Derivation-of-the}),\nsuch a model should also be able to justify the \\emph{spontaneous\nrecovery effect }\\cite{Miller1995}, which could occur after a classical\nconditioning extinction. This phenomenon, which consists in the possibility\nof experiencing a conditioned response some time after a complete\nconditioned extinction, cannot be described in terms of the Rescorla-Wagner\nmodel \\cite{Miller1995}. Moreover, we argue that the passive residual\nresponse due to a contrast effect (e.g., an inhibitory response due\nto the lack of an expected UCS elicitation) is able to counteract\nthe effect of a residual conditioned Pavlovian response, which, in\nturn, it can not be detected. For this reason, after the dissipation\nof a contrast passive response, the conditioned reflex can be observed\nagain. Our viewpoint is partially supported by the fact that spontaneus\nrecovery is stronger when conditioning extinction occurs through massed\ntrials (i.e., in the presence of a small ITI, which are known to enhance\ncontrast effects) and weaker when extinction occurs through widely\nspaced trials (i.e., in the presence of a larger ITI which determines\na smaller contrast effect) \\cite{Urcelay2009}.\n\n\n\\section{Misattribution of a source of stimulation and evaluative conditioning\\label{sec:Misattribution-of-a}}\n\nWhen a source of emotional stimulation elicits a subject, the process\nof encoding emotional memory starts; this involves various interactions\nbetween the amygdala and the hippocampus \\cite{Richardson2004}. This\nencoding results in the processing and storage of different pieces\nof information, such as contextual information, the elements determining\ninternal states and the elicited response. Generally speaking, the\nhippocampus (and, in particular, the \\emph{dentate gyrus}, DG) encodes\ncontextual information, whereas the BLA encodes emotional valence\nand unconditioned stimulus representation \\cite{Gore2015,Redondo2014}.\nThe encoding of emotional memory requires that the source of stimulation\nis correctly detected and attributed. When an emotional response due\nto a source of stimulation is attributed to a wrong source, an event\nof \\emph{source misattribution }occurs (e.g., see \\cite{Bryant2003a,Cotton1981,Jones2009},\nand references therein). Note that misattributions may result either\nfrom conscious, accessible and measurable controlled processes, or\nfrom spontaneous, inaccesible, automatic processes \\cite{Anderson1989,Uleman1987}.\nIn the last case this phenomenon is called \\emph{implicit misattribution}\n(e.g., see\\emph{ }\\cite{Anderson1989,Hutter2013,Uleman1987}).\n\nA quantitative description of the source misattribution phenomena\ncan be developed on the basis of our dynamic model; moreover, the\nnew results about this topic shed new light on the problem of \\emph{evaluative\nconditioning} (EC). Both these issues are illustrated in the remaining\npart of this Section.\n\n\n\\subsection{Source misattribution: a quantitative analysis\\label{sub:Source-Misattribution:-quantitat}}\n\nLet us focus again, like in the previous Section, on multiple trials\nof the interaction between a given aource and a subject and assume\na discrete-time scale in our analysis. In a generic trial one of the\nfollowing mutually exclusive events might happen: 1) the elicited\nresponse is correctly attributed to the source of stimulation, so\nthat the emotional reactive response is computed and coded according\nto Eq. (\\ref{eq:recursive-2}); 2) no source of stimulation is identified\nand, consequently, no reactive response is encoded and associated\nwith the source; 3) the elicited response is misattributed to another\n(others) source(s) of stimulation. In the following we focus on the\nlast event and assume, without any loss of generality, that the misattributed\nsource of stimulation is initially \\emph{neutral} (i.e., it does not\nelicit an active or a reactive emotional response). Actually, this\nevent encompasses the following three mutually exclusive cases: \n\na) The misattribution occurs in the presence of an active response;\nfor instance, this occurs when an hidden active source of stimulation\n(e.g., the hidden administration of a given drug able to elicit an\nemotional component) is misattributed to another insignificant source\nof stimulation. \n\nb) The misattribution occurs in the presence of a residual (i.e.,\npassive) response decay only (in other words, no active or reactive\nresponses are elicited); in this case the misattribution trial follows\nthe elicitation trial and occurs during the excitation decay.\n\nc) The misattribution occurs when a purely reactive source of stimulation\nis eliciting the subject, so that the associated response is purely\nreactive.\n\nIf the misattributed source of stimulation is not neutral but elicits\na response, the response elicited during the misattribution process\nwill result from the superposition of the actual source response with\nthe previous non-attributed emotional state \\cite{Zillmann1971}.\nFor this reason, in this case the previous non-attributed emotional\nstate ``energizes'' the actual source. \n\nIn the following the above mentioned three cases are analysed in the\nframework of the dynamical model developed in the previous Section;\nmoreover, it is assumed that misattribution always occurs in the first\ntrial and that the previous reactive response is equal to zero (i.e.,\n$y_{0}=0$).\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Case a): Misattribution occurring in the presence of an active response.}\n\nIn this case, the response in the first trial is only due to the active\ncomponent (i.e., to $X$; see Eq. (\\ref{eq:recursive-2})) elicited\nby a non-attributed source of stimulation (e.g., an hidden administered\ndrug). Consequently, the error signal in the first trial, denoted\n$e_{1}$, is equal to $X$ and the corresponding reactive component\n(expressed by $\\alpha\\cdot X$) is coded for the new misattributed\nsource of stimulation. If the original (i.e., true) source of stimulation\nceases to actively elicitate the subject in the following trials (i.e.,\nthe physical active component becomes zero), a negative error signal\nis computed. In this case, after repetitive expousures of the misattributed\nsource without active elicitation, the emotional response asymptotically\ntends to zero (according to a mathematical law similar to that expressed\nby Eq. (\\ref{eq:solution-d-e}). \n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Case b): Misattribution occuring in the presence of a decaying residual\nresponse only.}\n\nThis case is known in literature as \\emph{transfer paradigm} (described\nin the Hullian \\emph{drive theory} \\cite{Hull1943}) or \\emph{excitation\ntransfer} \\cite{Bunce1993,Zillmann1971,Zillmann1972}, and refers\nto the influence of a prior episode of arousal on subsequent emotional\nresponses. In this case, since environmental cues about the actual\nsource of a residual arousal are missing, such an arousal is misattributed\nto a subsequent stimulus; this may result in an intensification of\nthe subject's emotional response to the new stimulus (see \\cite{Bunce1993}\nand references therein). In this case, in the first trial the registered\nresponse is due to a passive (residual) response only, which is denoted\n$\\xi$ in the following. Consequently, the error $e_{1}$ in the first\ntrial is equal to $\\xi$ and the reactive response stored for the\nmisattributed source is equal to $\\alpha\\cdot\\xi$. Moreover, if the\nsubject is elicited by the misattributed source in a successive trial,\nthe corresponding reactive response is given again by $\\alpha\\cdot\\xi$,\nwhich is smaller than what was expected for that source (i.e., $\\xi$),\nso that a negative error signal is computed. Therefore, if further\ntrials occur, the emotional response asymptotically tends to zero,\nsimilarly as in the previous case. \n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Case c): Misattribution occurring in the presence of a purely reactive\nsource of stimulation eliciting the subject.}\n\nIn this case, the response in the first trial (when the misattribution\nis occuring), called $i_{U}$, is due to a purely reactive response\nelicited by another unrevealed source (e.g., a subliminal emotional\nstimulation \\cite{Esteves1994,Glascher2003,Mayer1999}). Hence, the\nresponse attributed to the new source (because of the misattribution)\nis equal to $i_{U}$, which, in this case, is exactly what the amygdala\nis eliciting, so that the error $e_{1}$ in the first trial is equal\nto zero (i.e., the elicited response coincides with the expected response).\nHence, during the second trial, the expousure to the new source determines\nthe reactive response elicited by the amygdala during the first trial\n($i_{U}$); furthermore, since the contribution due to the error signal\nis equal to zero, the overall response remains equal to $i_{U}$.\nFor the same reason, the response remains constant during the successive\ntrials. These results, that hold if habituation or \\emph{mere exposure\n}phenomena \\cite{zajonc_mere_2001} are neglected, show that an inextinguishable\n(i.e., not vanishing through repetitive trials of source perception)\nreactive response can be obtained through a complete misattribution\nof a purely reactive emotional response. Note that, generally speaking,\na source of stimulation is expected to elicit an active component\ntoo, and when this active component is no longer present, a negative\nerror signal drives the response extinction through repetitive expousures,\nas illustrated in the Section \\ref{sub:Quantitative-analysis-d-e}.\nOn the contrary, our mathematical results show that, if the stored\nresponse associated with a stimulus is purely reactive (i.e., no active\ncomponent is expected), the error signal is equal to zero in each\ntrial, because the reactive response corresponds to the expected response;\nfor this reason, no updating of the emotional reactive response occurs.\nA concrete example of such effect is the EC through \\emph{implicit\nmisattribution} \\cite{Hutter2013,Jones2009} (see Section \\ref{sub:Evaluative-conditioning}).\n\nLet us define now a \\emph{non-active stimulus }as a stimulus eliciting\na reactive (or null) response only; given this definition, our main\nfinding can be summarised in the following corollary.\n\n\\emph{{\\textsc{{Corollary 1}}}}\n\n\\emph{If a purely reactive emotional response is attributed to a non-active\nstimulus, this stimulus becomes a resistant-to-extinction source of\nreactive emotional stimulation.}\n\n\\medskip{}\n\n\n\\emph{Corollary} 1 allows us to justify the inextinguishability of\nEC due to\\emph{ }implicit misattribution (see \\cite{Hutter2013,Jones2009}\nand references therein), and could suggest a mechanism for other forms\nof resistant-to-extinction responses. In practice, through the repeated\napplication of Corollary 1, in each misattribution stage the reactive\nresponse is given by the \\emph{sum} of the previous reactive responses\nevoked by the considered stimulus (because of the resistant-to-extinction\nnature of the reactive stimulus itself) with the actual misattributed\nreaction (in other words, the reactive response is \\emph{cumulative}).\nThis could explain why an emotional additive increase can be obtained\nnaturally in every day life through the so called \\emph{incubation\neffect} \\cite{book_traumatic2012,Davey1989} (note that even a summation\nof different reactive sources could be misattributed to one single\ntarget stimulus). More specifically, some neurotic individuals can\nrehearse a trauma in their minds, or people can misattribute some\nbackground emotional states (such as mood and others irrilevant and\ndisconnected emotional events) forward a target stimulus, which, in\nturn, becomes able to elicit a stronger arousal at every misattribution\nor rumination stage \\cite{Davey1989}. \n\nFurthermore, Corollary 1 provides theoretical basis for the develpment\nof purely reactive emotional stimuli: in principle, an additive and\na resistant-to-extinction emotional reaction can be obtained in a\ncontrolled environment, through repetitive interactions between a\nsubject, a non-detectable reactive emotional source (the misattributed\nsource) and a target stimulus (to be attributed). In practice, a confounding\nsource (or a compound of confounding sources) of reactive stimulation\ncould elicit a subject in the presence of a target stimulus, which\nhas to become the attributed source of stimulation. Moreover, through\nrepetitive elicitations, the target stimulus is expected to produce\nan inextinguishable and increasing reactive response. One method to\nobtain a compound of confounding reactive sources is to develop a\nsubliminal masked expousure of an emotional and sufficently strong\naroused stimulus \\cite{Flykt2007,Morris1998,Morris1999,Ohman1993,Ohman1994},\nwhile a target stimulus has to be clearly perceived by the subject.\nTo this aim the confounding reactive stimulus has to elicit the same\nemotional components as the target, in order to obtain the superposition\n(i.e., the algebraic sum) of multiple contributions, i.e. the process\nwe call \\emph{implicit accumulation effect}. We believe that further\nresearch activities are needed to understand how to construct and\noptimize a suitable target stimulus (which must be easily attribuitable\nby a subject in relation to the emotional induced response) and which\nsensory elements (e.g., tactile, visual or auditory elements) should\nbe included, in order to optimize the effect. Furthermore, it is important\nto consider that a misattribution mechanism requires that the response\nevoked by the UCS could feasibly have arisen from the target CS, so\nsome minimal degree of feature matching is a necessary condition;\nwithout it, source confusion (and misattribution) is unlikely to occur\n\\cite{Jones2009}.\n\nFinally, it is important to point out that a practical exploitation\nof our results could be represented by the development of novel methods\nto mitigate an undesired emotional reaction. In fact, in principle,\nan undesired reactive response could be weakened through the misattributed\nelicitation of an opposite valenced reactive response (for instance\nthe pain perception can be weakened through the stimulation with rewarding\nreactive stimulus, or it can enhanced through the stimulation with\nanxiety related or emotionally threatening reactive stimulus \\cite{Roy2009,Wagener2009,Wiech2009}),\nor through a reactive inhibition. This might represent a valid supporting\ntool for treating certain psychopathologies for which the mere exposure\ntreatment, even if coupled with drug administration, could fail to\nextinguish an undesired emotional reactive response (see Section \\ref{sub:reactive-versus-active}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Evaluative conditioning through implicit misattribution\\label{sub:Evaluative-conditioning}}\n\nAs already mentioned above, the EC phenomenon represents the formation\n(or change of the valence) of a stimulus, called CS, originating from\na prior pairing of the CS itself with another stimulus, called UCS\n\\cite{Baeyens1993,Gast2012,Hofmann2010,Houwer2001,Hutter2013,Jones2009};\nunlike Pavlovian conditioning, a CS response acquired through EC seems\nto be resistant to extinction \\cite{Baeyens2005}.\n\nIn recent years various research activities have been devoted to investigate\nthe role played in EC by the \\emph{awareness of contingencies} between\na CS and its paired UCS \\cite{Baeyens1992,Baeyens1993,Dawson2007a,Hutter2013,Ruys2009}.\nIn particular, experimental evidence illustrated in \\cite{Hutter2013}\nleads to the conclusion that the EC occurrence can be justified by\ndifferent mechanisms, like classical conditioning (and, consequently,\nthe awareness of CS-UCS contingencies) and implicit misattribution\n(in this case, awareness is not required). In the same reference it\nis also shown that sequential CS-UCS presentations are subject to\nUCS revaluation, retroactive inference from subsequent learning and\ncontingency awareness (these phenomena are typically related to classical\nconditioning); on the contrary, a simultaneous CS-UCS presentation,\nwhich, generally speaking, prevents awareness and facilitates the\nsource misattribution, can produce EC effects which are robust against\nall the factors mentioned above. Moreover, in \\cite{Jones2009} it\nis shown that, according to the implicit misattribution model, responses\nto UCSs can be misattributed without awareness to the CS, and that\nthe implicit misattribution depends on \\emph{source confusability},\nin other words the subject has to confuse which multiple coocuring\nstimuli in her environment is evoking the evaluative response. Furthermore,\nmanipulations of the variables related to the potential for the misattribution\nof an evaluation, (i.e., the source confusability) show that greater\nEC occurs with an higher degree of confusability \\cite{Jones2009}.\nHence, as already discussed in the previous Section, the inextinguishability\nof the CS valence in EC phenomena due to implicit misattribution can\nbe explained in terms of \\emph{Corollary }1; in other words, it is\nmotivated by the fact that the UCS (e.g., a reactive stimulus such\nas an emotional picture) behaves like a purely reactive source of\nstimulation, and the reactive outcome is attributed (at least partially)\nto the CS, so that the response stored and expected for that stimulus\nis purely reactive (see also the\\emph{ Case c} in the Section \\ref{sub:Source-Misattribution:-quantitat}\nfor the quantitative analysis). This result is also supported by Baeyens\nand colleagues \\cite{Baeyens1993}, who found that EC was not sensitive\nto the degree of statistical contingency between the CS and US, but\nEC should increased with the absolute number of pairings because each\nprovides an opportunity for misattribution, and such misattributions\ncould act cumulatively \\cite{Jones2009}. It is worth mentioning that\nEC could also be determined by other mechanisms, or by the combinations\nof different mechanisms \\cite{Jones2009}, such as, classical conditioning,\nthe formation of particular beliefs about the CS and\\emph{ conceptual\nrecategorization} of the CS \\cite{Jones2009}. \n\n\n\\section{Differences and relations between the implicit emotional model and\nthe predictive coding model\\label{sub:diff_interoception}}\n\nThe predictive coding (or active inference) version of interoception\n\\cite{Barrelt2015,Pezzulo2015,Seth2013}, described in Section \\ref{sub:On-error-based-emotional},\ncannot be applied to implicit emotional learning because the theorem\nderived in Section \\ref{sub:Theorem:-On-the}. In fact, since the\nprediction signal (which coincides with the reactive response in predictive\ncoding) and the active (bottom-up sensory) elicitation sum up, the\nprediction response would increase indefinitely over successive trials.\nOne might argue that the precision associated with the error signal\noriginating from the reactive (self-made) emotional response should\nbe reduced by attentional mechanisms, like in active inference in\nprimary motor cortex (M1), where the gain (or precision) associated\nwith the sensations originating from the self-made action are reduced\n\\cite{Barrelt2015,Shipp2013} (see also the \\emph{corollary discharge};\ne.g. \\cite{Crapse2008}). Nevertheless, this cannot occur within the\nemotional system, since, the reactive and the active emotional responses\nare indistinguishable and, for this reason, add up in algebraic sense,\nas shown by the experimental evidence described in Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error}. \n\nDespite this, we argue that the predictive coding principle could\nbe applied under the assumption that different hierarchical neural\nnetworks operate in succession, and others in parallel, during implicit\nemotional learning. More specifically, if an active stimulus elicitates\na given subject, a first neural network, describing perception, determines\nwhich is the most probable stimulus responsible for the elicitation\n(i.e., the source attribution process) through the maximization of\nthe Bayesian posterior probability distribution (or the free energy\nminimization, which leads to the ``surprise'' or entropy minimization\n\\cite{friston2009,Friston2008}), then the network for the computation\nof the expected outcome (managed by the OFC) interacts with the network\nwhich computes the updating of the reactive responses (within the\namygdala). However, our model provides a system level representation\nof implicit emotional learning and, for this reason, the details about\nthe iterative computations (and messages passing) between neurons\nor between different neuronal hierarchical levels of the involved\nsignals (such as error signals, expected outcomes or reactive responses,\nand the neural computations leading to source attribution) are behind\nthe scope of our analysis. For instance, our system-level model assumes\nthat a distributed network computes error signals without entering\ninto the details of such a computation; hence, for example, our model\ncannot be account for phenomena or physiopathologies originating from\na defect in the error computation processes (such as a pathological\ndopamine system unable to properly compute the precisions associated\nwith the error signals). Nevertheless, our model can specifically\npredict phenomena and pathologies originating from system-level problems\n(in other words, it provides a macro-level perspective). Furthermore,\nour model does not describe the computations leading to source attribution,\ninstead it describes the effects originating from the cases in which,\nduring a stimulation, a stimulus is correctly attributed, misattributed\nor even not attributed. Finally, it is worth mentioning that an important\nsimilarity between the proposed implicit emotional learning model\nand the active inference model is represented by the fact that the\nbrain can experience a reactive stimulation (i.e., a prior bayesian\nbelief, in the active inference terminology) shaped by prior experiences\nand learning, even if the stimulus does not actively elicitate the\nsubject. However, it is important to stress out that in our model\nthe reactive response is differentiated from the expected outcome,\nwhich represents a value (more precisely a function over internal\nphysiological states) of the elicitation that the brain (OFC) expects\nto experience from a given UCS. In other words, expecting a given\nresponse does not coincide with the ``self-induction'' of that response\n(see the Theorem in Section \\ref{sub:Theorem:-On-the}). Furthermore,\na variation of the active (sensory or bottom-up) stimulation leads\nto an update or modulation of the expected outcome and of the reactive\nemotional response associated to the given stimulus.\n\n\n\\section{On the emotional learning in classical conditioning and UCS evaluation}\n\nIn this Section the intrinsic differences and the relations between\nthe mechanism of learning in classical conditioning and that previously\ndescribed for UCS revaluation learning are illustrated. Then, it is\nshown that the Rescorla-Wagner equation for classical conditioning\nrepresents an approximation of a specific case of emotional learning,\nsince it can be derived from our model, exploiting the stochastic\nHebbian plasticity rule \\cite{Amit1994,Fusi2002,Fusi2007,Soltani2006,Soltani2010}\nand taking into account specific approximations. \n\n\n\\subsection{Introduction\\label{sub:Introduction}}\n\nIn classical conditioning a CS, which is usually a neutral/innocuous\nstimulus like a sound or a neutral visual cue, is paired with a source\nof stimulation (e.g., an electric shock or food), which is called\nUCS. Through repeated CS-UCS pairings the CS can elicit a CR, called\n\\emph{unconditioned response} (UCR), which is often similar to the\nresponse aroused by the paired UCS \\cite{Fanselow2005,Kim2006,Pavlov1927}.\nWhen the UCS represents an aversive stimulus, the CS-UCS pairing phenomenon\nis called \\emph{Pavlovian fear conditioning} \\cite{Fanselow2005,Kim2006}.\nIn fear conditioning with humans, an indirect estimate of the autonomic\nCR can be obtained measuring the changes in \\emph{skin conductance\nlevel} (SCL), i.e. the so called \\emph{skin conductance response}\n(SCR). Note, however, that in the analysis illustrated in the previous\nsections, the UCR (i.e., the response elicited by a source of stimulation)\nis not simply represented by indirect measurements, such as SCR or\nthe degree of salivation \\cite{Pavlov1927}. In fact, it represents\nthe response associated with the brain neural populations elicited\nby the UCS and, consequently, includes both non-emotional and emotional\ncomponents. More specifically, the UCR consists of a reactive response\ncomponent ($\\mathbf{y}_{rem}$), a component due to the active (physical)\nstimulation of emotional brain areas ($\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$; see Eq.\n(\\ref{eq:2})) and a contribution due to non-emotional stimulation\n($\\mathbf{y}_{ne}$). For this reason, the SCR acquired during a specific\nUCS stimulation, like an electric shock delivery, represents only\nan indirect and correlated measure of the full response $\\mathbf{y}$\nexpressed by Eqs. (\\ref{eq:rappresentaz_base},\\ref{eq:em-ne-components}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Different emotional learning mechanisms: for a primary stimulus (UCS)\nand for a stimuli association (CS-UCS)\\label{sub:On-the-learning}}\n\nEven if both a CS and the paired UCS could be able to eliciting the\nsame emotional reaction under some circumstances, we argue they are\nqualitatively different entities and, most important, they might be\nlearned through independent mechanisms. In fact, on the one hand,\nthrough classical conditioning, which represents the learning of stimulus\ncontingencies, a CS acquires the capacity to elicit a response because\nit is able to signal a likely occurrence of the UCS elicitation. On\nthe other hand, during \\emph{implicit emotional learning }(or\\emph{\n}UCS evaluation)\\emph{,} an element acquires the capacity to elicit\na response because a \\emph{direct attribution} of the outcome forward\nthat element (i.e., the UCS). Furthermore, the UCS outcome revaluation\n(i.e., inflation and devaluation) is also driven by implicit emotional\nlearning.\n\nOur claims are supported by various results available in the literature\n\\cite{Davey1989,Gottfried2004,Hosoba2001,Rescorla1974,Schultz2013}.\nIn particular, \\cite{Rescorla1974}, on the basis of the results of\nvarious experiments in which inflation (UCR increase) is performed\nafter conditioning, came to the conclusion that organisms form memories\nof a given UCS independently of associative connections with a CS.\nFurthermore, in \\cite{Schultz2013} it is shown that the automatic\nresponse associated with a UCS (SCR) changes through the revaluation\nof the UCS itself in the absence of a variation in the probability\nof the CS-UCS contingency. In \\cite{Gottfried2004} it is shown that\na UCS inflation, even during trials of conditioning extinction, results\nin a larger CR. In \\cite{Davey1989}, starting from contemporary models\nof Pavlovian conditioning in humans, it is inferred that the processes\nof CS-UCS association and UCS revaluation may be largely independent.\nIn particular, UCS revaluation can be obtained in different ways (including\nverbal suggestions and cognitive processes) and this modifies the\nstrength of a CR in the absence of any change in stimulus contingencies.\nMoreover, in the experiment reported in \\cite{Hosoba2001} thirty\nsubjects were randomly assigned to the inflation (UCR increase) or\nthe deflation (UCR decrease) group, after a common classical conditioning\nacquisition procedure (i.e., after experiencing the same UCR strength).\nDuring the test session the indicators of the CR intensity were SCRs\nand subjective aversion to the conditioned stimulus (CS). The main\nresults obtained in that case can be summarized as follows: a) the\nCR strength measured by SCR was increased by the UCS inflation and\ndecreased by the UCS deflation; b) the subjective aversiveness to\nthe CS was not sensitive to both manipulations of the UCS intensity.\n\nAll the above mentioned results lead us to the following conclusions:\na) UCS revaluation occurs out of classical conditioning and, implicitly,\nis able to modify the CR; b) the strength of an autonomic CR might\nbe influenced by the subjective revaluation of a UCS, even when the\nCS-UCS contingency remains the same; c) the probability of a CS-UCS\ncontingency (i.e., the CS prediction of the occurrence of a UCS) through\nPavlovian conditioning is independent of the UCS revaluation. For\nthese reasons, the \\emph{UCS evaluation} (and revaluation) cannot\nbe described by classical conditioning, so that a specific model (i.e.,\na model for implicit emotional learning or UCS revaluation, like that\nillustrated in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}) is necessary.\nThese concepts are summarized in Fig. 4, where the CS representation\nis related to the UCS representation through a connection whose strength\nis proportional to the probability (or the \\emph{belief}) of stimulus\ncontingency, i.e. to the probability $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $\nof the UCS stimulation conditioned on the CS perception (briefly,\nthe CS-UCS contingency probability updated through the classical conditioning\nlearning). It is worth noting that the probability $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $\ncan be increased through repetitive CS-UCS pairings or reduced through\na CS exposition without UCS elicitation. These probability/belief\nupdatings reflects the CR during testing, according to the classical\nconditioning learning (e.g., through the results given by the Rescorla-Wagner\nequation \\cite{Rescorla1972}). Note also that, in Fig. 4 the connection\nbetween the UCS and the corresponding reactive response ($i_{R}$,\nsee Eqs. (\\ref{eq:function_amygdala}-\\ref{eq:Ii1})) is highlighted. \n\nThe schematic representation illustrated in Fig. 4 is in agreement\nwith various recent results available in \\cite{Redondo2014} and \\cite{Gore2015}.\nIn particular, the experimental results shown in \\cite{Redondo2014}\nhave evidenced that the hippocampal engram memory (which codes the\ncontextual CS) is neutral and could freely associate with either positive\nor negative emotions (through the UCS representation) coded within\nthe BLA. The connection between the contextual CS coded in the DG\nin the hyppocampus and the UCS coded within the BLA could also be\nswitched by optogenetic technology manipulation. In practice, a CS-UCS\nconnection (denoted CS-UCS \\#1) can be switched to another CS-UCS\nconnection (denoted CS-UCS \\#2) of opposite valence with respect to\nthe first one (e.g., from a fear emotional response to a reward emotional\nresponse). Indeed, the optogenetic reactivation of the DG engram-bearing\ncells during the presentation of a UCS having valence opposite to\nthe original one strengthens the connectivity of these DG cells with\na new subset of BLA neurons, while weakening the connections established\nduring the original learning \\cite{Redondo2014}. From these results\nit can be inferred that the CS memory engram is neutral and that a\nCS can elicit an emotional reaction through the connection to an UCS\nin the BLA. Additional results about the effects of optogenetic manipulation\nare illustrated in \\cite{Gore2015}, where it is shown that the projection\nof a CS representation onto a UCS ensemble in the BLA is required\nfor the expression of a learned behavior, and that a CS (e.g., auditory\nor olfactory) activates an UCS representation in the BLA to generate\na learned behavior. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\noindent \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics{figure4}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\caption{{\\footnotesize{}Schematic representation of the connections between\na CS, the paired UCS and the reactive response ($i_{R}$) associated\nwith the representation of the UCS itself. The reactive response $i_{R}$\nis determined by the UCS revaluation learning, instead the connection\nstrength between CS and UCS ($\\omega_{CS-UCS}$) is determined by\nclassical conditioning learning. Note that this schematic representation\nis in agreement with the experimental results shown in \\cite{Gore2015,Redondo2014}. }}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nOn the basis of our previous analysis we can state that a CS elicitation,\nin turn, arouses a UCS reactive response ($i_{R}$) through a probabilistic\n(or belief) connection; furthermore, the value of the associated probability\n(or \\emph{belief}) $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $ is determined by\nclassical conditioning (or even by optogenetic manipulations \\cite{Redondo2014}).\nFor instance, at the end of a conditioning acquisition, the probability\n$\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $ is close to unity, since a CS predicts\nalmost certainly the UCS ``imminent'' elicitation. In this case\na trial test produces a CR expressed by $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} \\cdot i_{R}\\simeq i_{R}$\nand, consequently, given by $i_{R}$, which represents the reactive\nresponse, determined by the amygdala reaction computed and stored\nwithin the amygdala itself for the considered UCS (see Eqs. (\\ref{eq:function_amygdala}-\\ref{eq:Ii1})).\nWhen the value of $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} $ is between zero and\nunity, the CR can be computed, for instance, through the Rescorla-Wagner\nequation \\cite{Rescorla1972} and has to equal the product $\\Pr\\left\\{ UCS/CS\\right\\} \\cdot i_{R}$.\nTherefore, at the end of a conditioning acquisition process, there\nis no real difference, in terms of emotional reactive response, if\nthe subject perceives a CS alone or the paired UCS alone (note that\nthe term ``response'', and not ``behavior'', is adopted here,\nsince different intensities of the components of the same emotional\nresponse may lead to distinct observable behaviors; this issue is\ndiscussed in more detail below). This is exemplified by the case of\nthe dog observed at the end of a conditioned acquisition in the conditioning\nexperiments performed by \\cite{Pavlov1927}; in fact, as far as the\ndegree of salivation (i.e., the behavioral outcome due to the reactive\nresponse $i_{R}$) was concerned, perceiving the food (UCS) or perceiving\nthe bell (CS) which signalled the incoming food, did not really make\nany difference (at least during the first trial, before the eventual\nextinction process). Note that this does not mean that the CS becomes\na substitute of the UCS, as initially supposed by Pavlov in the so\ncalled ``\\emph{Stimulus-Substitution Theory}''\\cite{Chance2008},\nbut that the CS triggers the reactive response ($i_{R}$) through\nthe elicitation of the representation of the paired UCS within the\nBLA (such an UCS elicitation through the CS perception could be ``partial''\nor ``total'' depending of the CS-UCS connection strength; see Fig.\n4 and \\cite{Redondo2014}). In fact, as already stated in Section\n\\ref{sec:Response-representation}, a CR and the corresponding UCR\nare not identical, and only in specific conditions they could be similar\n(in addition, a UCR, unlike a CR, may involve an active component,\n$X$). In practice, the CR mimics the emotional components elicited\nby the corresponding UCR (see Section \\ref{sub:On-the-specificity-of-error}\nand Remarks \\ref{rem:Ii+Ie} and \\ref{rem:emotional_mimicking}) but,\ngenerally speaking, with a lower intensity, since the emotional system\nhas to be stable (i.e., $\\left|\\alpha\\right|<1$ is required; see\nH.6 in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}) and because the\nactive component ($X$) is no longer present in a purely reactive\nstimulation. These considerations could be useful to explain the fact\nthat, in specific circumstances, the CR might represent an opposite\nbehavioral response with respect to the original UCR; for instance,\none unconditioned response to morphine is represented by the reduced\nsensitivity to painful stimuli; however, the conditioned response\nto stimuli associated with morphine is represented by an increased\nsensitivity to painful stimuli \\cite{Siegel1975}. Phenomena like\nthis could be explained considering that, generally speaking, the\ndegree of elicitation of a neuronal population (or the quantity of\na specific type of released neurotransmitter), due to a CR is smaller\nthan the original one generated by the corresponding UCR (e.g., an\nactive morphine administration) because of the above mentioned reasons.\nIn particular, in neuropharmacology \\cite{Goodman2006} it is well\nknown that an \\emph{excitatory} effect is commonly observed with low\nconcentrations of certain \\emph{depressant} drugs (e.g., alcohol,\nmorphine, general anesthetics) because of either the depression of\ninhibitory systems or a transient increase in the release of excitatory\ntransmitters (note that an excitatory state occurs only with low concentrations\nof the depressant). Consequently, within the complex CNS structure,\ndifferent \\emph{doses} of a specific receptor agonist or of a specific\nneurotransmitter (i.e., different intensities of a specific component\nof a response) could lead to very different (even opposite) observable\nbehavioral responses (see \\cite{Goodman2006} for an exahustive review\nabout this topic). \n\nGenerally speaking, the typical scenario of a laboratory, where the\nUCS is represented by an electric shock device, which is permanently\nconnected to the subject who does not know when the electric shock\nwill be effectively delivered (unless signalled by the paired CS),\nleads to the impossibility of observing the emotional reactive response\n$i_{R}$ when the source of stimulation (i.e., the UCS electric shock\ndevice in the above mentioned scenario) is perceived by the subject.\nOn the contrary, we argue that, if the electric device is repeatedly\nconnected to the subject and disconnected from him/her in each trial\nof electric stimulation, the subject perception of the connected UCS\ndevice will elicit $i_{R}$ exactly as the CS perception does (after\na conditioned acquisition for the CS). One may argue that, in this\ncase, the CS is represented by the electric shock device and that\nthe electric shock delivery represents the UCS. Note, however, that\nin the considered scenario the device represents a primary source\nof direct stimulation (i.e., the UCS), whereas the shock delivery\nrepresents the physical elicitation of that source, which supports\nthe active elicited response (i.e., the term $X$, see Eq. (\\ref{eq:recursive-2}),\nor the term $\\mathbf{y}_{aem}$, see Eq. (\\ref{eq:2})). Note also\nthat the same considerations can be expressed when the primary stimulus\nis represented by food \\cite{Pavlov1927}, but do not hold for a neutral\nCS (e.g., a neutral sound) signalling the UCS, since, in the last\ncase, the CS cannot substain a direct physical stimulation. \n\n\n\\subsection{Conceptual difference between encoding a stimulus as a primary stimulus\n(UCS) or as a conditioned stimulus (CS)\\label{sub:Conceptual-difference-between} }\n\nAnother important issue related to the differences in the learning\nmechanisms analyzed in the previous Section concerns the regions of\nthe brain in which a CS and a UCS are memorised. If a contextual CS\nis considered, the CS engram and the the associated UCS are stored\nin the DG and in the BLA, respectively \\cite{Redondo2014}; however,\nit is still unclear if the same rule applies to any non-contextual\nCS. Note also that phylogenetic fear-relevant stimuli, which are sources\nof stimulation according to the definition provided in Section \\ref{sub:Active-and-reactive},\nare natively stored in the mammial brain \\cite{Ohman1993,Ohman1994}. \n\nIn the following we summarise the most important experimental results\nwhich concern the \\emph{subliminal elicitation of} UCSs and the \\emph{failure\nin subliminal elicitation of ``previously-neutral'' conditioned\n}CSs. Then, some important conclusions about CS/UCS memorisation in\nspecific regions of the brain are inferred from them.\n\n\\emph{Subliminal elicitation of UCSs} - In various experiments accomplished\nby \u00d6hman \\emph{et al.} the awareness of visual stimuli was blocked\nby means of \\emph{backward masking} \\cite{Esteves1994,Ohman1998}.\nIn this case a target picture, representing a CS, is presented in\nan short interval (lasting less than 50 ms) and is followed by the\npresentation of a masking picture having similar luminosity and colour\nfeatures, and shown in the same area of the visual field \\cite{Enns2000}.\nThe presentation of this masking stimulus interrupts the cortical\nprocessing of the target stimulus \\cite{Noguchi2005,Rolls1999}; hence,\nthe target is invisible to the conscious and awareness of the subject\n\\cite{Kim2005}. Moreover, in these experiments snake- or spider-\nfearful subjects have been exposed to phylogenetic fear-relevant masked\nstimuli (snakes or spiders) and neutral masked stimuli (flowers and\nmushrooms). The acquired experimental results have evidenced that\nonly the phylogenetic stimuli were able to elicit an automatic SCR\nresponse in phobic patients \\cite{Ohman1994}. These findings agree\nwith the hypothesis about amygdala functionality proposed by LeDoux\n\\cite{LeDoux1996,LeDoux2000}. In fact, LeDoux has hypothized the\nexistence of a \\emph{thalamic pathway} to the amygdala; such a pathway\nwould allow to automatically detect evolutionary prepared visual stimuli\n(like emotional faces, spiders, snakes, injuries). Note that this\nmodel is also supported by other results acquired by different researchers\nthat have employed masking in normal participants \\cite{Liddell2004,Morris1999}\nor have observed brain activity in patients affected by cortical blindness\n\\cite{Gelder2006,Morris2001}. According to this model about amygdala\nfunctionality, the superior colliculus stimulates the pulvinar nucleus\nof the thalamus, which then arouses the amygdala \\cite{LeDoux2000,Ohman2005,Ohman2007}.\nThis mechanism is also supported by various brain imaging studies,\nwhich show that masked facial stimuli activate the amygdala exactly\nas masked pictures of threatening animals (such as snakes and spiders)\ndo \\cite{Ohman2005}. This suggests that the salient features representing\nan aversive source of stimulation could be stored in the amygdala. \n\n\\emph{Failure in subliminal elicitation of ``previously-neutral''\nconditioned} CSs - Other experimental results available in the literature\nhelp us to understand what happens when a previous neutral stimulus\n(i.e., a CS) conditioned on an active source of stimulation (i.e.,\nan UCS, like an electric shock) elicits a subject, and in particular,\nif the CS representation is stored in the same region as a phylogenetic\naversive stimulus. Note that, from a supraliminar perspective, both\na purely reactive UCS (e.g., a snake picture) and a previously conditioned\nCS (e.g., a neutral picture conditioned to an electric shock) are\nable to elicit a similar autonomic response, at least in subjects\nsuffering from a phobia towards the phylogenetic stimulus represented\non the exposed pictures \\cite{Ohman1994}. A more interesting case\nis that of subliminal perception, where only the sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala\npathway is elicited because of the backward masking procedure described\nabove. Various results, acquired by Ohman and Soares in experiments\nof \\emph{differential conditioning}, are available about this case\n\\cite{Ohman1993}. In these experiments, a neutral stimulus, denoted\nCS+ (e.g., flowers or mushrooms) was paired with an electric shock\nUCS (i.e., an active source of stimulation) during the acquisition\nphase, and a different neutral stimulus, denoted CS-, was presented\nin the absence of the UCS. The results acquired during the extinction\nphase have evidenced that the conditioned CS+ was able to elicit a\ndifferential response (in particular, an SCR response different from\nthe baseline level of the CS- response) only in the presence of supraliminar\nperception; on the contrary, no differential SCR response has been\nobserved in the case of masked perception. This means that, unlike\nthe case of a reactive UCS (such as spiders, snakes or angry faces),\nwhich is able to elicit an emotional reaction both through supraliminarly\nor subliminally perception \\cite{Ohman1994}, a previously neutral\nconditioned CS elicits an emotional response through supraliminar\nperception only. Therefore, the sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala pathway\n(i.e., the so called \\emph{high road} \\cite{LeDoux2000}) is unable\nto elicit a representation of the given CS; this representation, instead,\ncan be elicited only through the thalamus-cortex-amygdala pathway.\nThese considerarions lead us to the conclusion that a CS representation\nmight not be directly stored within the amygdala (or, in any case,\nnot in the same region as an UCS representation) even if it predicts\nan aversive-related stimulus. \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the same conditioning paradigms\nhave been used when employing biologically fear-related (phylogenetic)\nstimuli \\cite{Ohman1993}, angry faces \\cite{Esteves1994,Parra1997},\nand even ontogenetic pictures (i.e., pictures of cultural threats\nsuch as guns directed toward a subject) for CS+ and CS-. In all the\nseen experiments, even if the employed CSs were conditioned stimuli,\nthey were not neutral, since they represented reactive aversive emotional\nsources (i.e., reactive UCSs). This qualitative difference with respect\nto a neutral CS (i.e., to a CS not representing a reactive emotional\nsource) reflects the different behavioral results provided by the\nconsidered experiments and, in particular explains, the fact that,\neven during the masked extinction procedure, the CSs+ have been able\nto elicit an emotional response through the sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala\npathway. \n\nThe experimental results illustrated above have lead us to the following\nconclusions. It is likely that any representation of an emotional\nsource of stimulation, such as an innate biological fear-related threat\n(in other words, a phylogenetic source) or a cultural threat (i.e.,\nan ontogenetic source), is able to elicit an emotional response through\nthe sub-cortical thalamic-amygdala pathway; hence, this source is\nexpected to be stored in a \\emph{rapid access site} of the amygdala.\nOn the contrary, in the case of classical conditioning, a previously-neutral\nconditioned CS is unable to elicit a reactive emotional response through\nthe thalamic-amygdala pathway; consequently, it should be stored in\nother regions of the brain or in a region of the amygdala different\nfrom that employed for primary stimuli. Therefore, which is the qualitative\ndifference between a reactive UCS (e.g., an emotional picture) and\na previous neutral CS conditioned through classical conditioning?\nBoth UCS and CS are able to elicit similar responses supraliminarly,\nbut such stimuli are stored in different brain regions. We argue that\nthe main qualitative difference between these two cases is represented\nby how initially the stimulus has acquired the capacity to elicit\nan aversive emotional response, that is by how the stimulus has been\nencoded (as a primary stimulus or as a conditioned stimulus). In fact,\na phylogenetic source might be innate and natively stored within the\namygdala; moreover, an ontogenetic emotional source, such as a gun\n\\cite{Flykt2007}, might be acquired through learning mechanisms different\nfrom those of classical conditioning. It is reasonable to suppose\nthat a generic UCS, like an electric shock device or a weapon, is\nacquired through an active and direct stimulation (or even cognitively,\nexploiting aversive experiences of other individuals through social\nfear learning \\cite{Olsson2007,OlssonA2007}); consequently, the corresponding\noutcome will be directly \\emph{attributed} to that active source.\nIn brief, a UCS represents a stimulus able to directly elicit a response\n(i.e., it is encoded as a primary stimulus); on the contrary, a CS\ndoes not have such a capability and its role is limited to statistical\nsignalling of an incoming UCS. We also argue that the experiments\ndescribed above should also lead to similar conclusions if a new active\nsource of stimulation (i.e., an UCS which does not represent a phylogenetic\nthreatening stimulus nor an ontogenetic stimulus), experimentally\ngenerated, is adopted. In particular, the correctness of the last\nclaim could be assessed by modifying the experimental procedure described\nin \\cite{Flykt2007}; in particular, this would require the following\ntwo steps: a) introducing an additional phase in the experimental\nprocedure described in \\cite{Flykt2007}, in order to generate (starting\nfrom a neutral stimulus) a newly ontogenetic source of stimulation\nfor a group (through UCS evaluation), and a new conditioned stimulus\nfor another group (through classical conditioning learning); b) analyzing\nthe behaviors of the two different groups at the end of the learning\nprocedure. We expect to find out that both groups will be able to\nshow an emotional reaction (e.g., an SCR) through a supraliminar stimulus\nperception, whereas only the group who has encoded the stimulus as\na primary stimulus (i.e., as UCS) will be able to show an emotional\nreaction through subliminal perception (i.e., through the thalamo-amygdala\npathway). If such a result will be obtained, it will also definitively\nprove that the mechanism through which the aversive object has been\nencoded (i.e. through classical conditioning acquisition or by direct\nor implicit response attribution) makes the difference and determines\nthe brain region in which the stimulus representation will be stored.\n\nIn the absence of further experimental results, we believe, on the\nbasis of the existing literature, that the only reasonable claim that\ncan be made about the nature of a coded stimulus, is given by the\nfollowing remark.\n\\begin{rem}\n\\label{rem:UCS-in-amygdala}\n\\end{rem}\n\\emph{If a subliminally perceived cue elicits an emotional reaction,\nthen this means the cue representation is stored within the amygdala\nand it represents a source of emotional stimulation (i.e., an UCS).}\n\nNote that this remark is useful when analysing experimental results\nin which a subliminally perceived stimulus elicits a measurable emotional\nreaction. \n\n\n\\subsection{Derivation of the Rescorla-Wagner Equation for Classical Conditioning\nand a corrected formulation\\label{sub:Derivation-of-the}}\n\nIn this section it is shown how the Rescorla-Wagner equation for CS-UCS\nPavlovian conditioning can be derived starting from our model about\nthe implicit learning of an UCS outcome.\n\nOur derivation relies on the assumption that the CS-UCS synaptic connections\nare governed by the mechanisms of \\emph{stochastic Hebbian plasticity}\n\\cite{Amit1994,Fusi2002,Fusi2007,Hebb1949,Soltani2006,Soltani2010}.\nThis hypothesis is supported by both some experimental results shown\nin \\cite{Redondo2014} and \\cite{Gore2015}, and other models relying\non the fact that a CS-UCS pairing entails the Hebbian potentiation\nof the CS inputs onto the UCS representations in the BLA \\cite{Pape2010,Pickens2004,Sah2003}.\nIn practice, Hebbian learning is based on the idea that synapses between\nneurons being simultaneously active become stronger. Consequently,\n``neurons that fire together could wire together'' through an increase\nin synaptic efficacy mediated by \\emph{long term potentiation} (LTP,\nsee \\cite{Bliss1973}); on the contrary, a decrease in synaptic efficacy\nis mediated by \\emph{long term depression} (LTD) \\cite{Artola1990}.\nIn particular, in \\cite{Redondo2014} it is shown that the optogenetic\nreactivation of the DG engram-bearing cells coding a contextual CS,\nduring the presentation of a new UCS having valence opposite to the\noriginal UCS (which was previously paired with the CS itself), strengthens\nthe connectivity of these cells with a new subset of the BLA neurons,\nwhile weakening the connections established during the original learning\nprocess. In other words, the simultaneous activation of a CS neural\nrepresentation and of a new UCS strengthens a CS-UCS connection (through\nLTP) and, at the same time, weakens the connection (through LTD) between\nthe CS and the previously associated UCS, which is not simultaneously\nactive. \n\nAs illustrated in \\cite{Destexhe2004}, the main task of the sensory\nsystem is to detect (and model) correlations \\cite{Barlow1985} through\nneuron firing, in order to exploit \\textquoteleft suspicious coincidences\\textquoteright{}\nin complex incoming information. These correlations may form the \\textquoteleft objects\\textquoteright{}\nor \\textquoteleft features\\textquoteright{} of the representations\nof any stimulus. After being detected by primary sensory areas, such\ncorrelations can be used for binding elementary features into more\nelaborate percepts. These binding phenomena \\cite{Destexhe2004,Roskies1999}\nare based on the concept of neuronal assemblies, which are usually\ndefined as a group of neurons that transiently undergo synchronous\nfiring \\cite{Destexhe2004,Hebb1949}. This transient synchrony could\nform the basis of a common input to later stages of integration, and\nso promote responses that are specific to a given ensemble of features\n\\cite{Engel2001}. These mechanisms rely on the fact that cortical\nneurons are very efficient at detecting correlations \\cite{Abeles1991},\nas evidenced by computational models \\cite{Rudolph2001}. On the basis\nof these results it can be assumed that that the representation of\na CS and that of its associated UCS are formed by a \\emph{neuronal\nassembly}, which, in turn, is composed by cells assemblies representing\nspecific features, and that connections between the CS and the UCS\nneuronal assemblies are established through Hebbian plasticity. The\nimplications of this assumption are analysed in the following part\nof this Section, where a new sequence of trials, involving CS-UCS-subject\ninteractions, is taken into consideration.\n\nIn these trials we assume that: a) the source of stimulation (UCS)\nhas been acquired (i.e., properly coded as a source stimulus), and\nthe emotional learning for the UCS source has encoded the reactive\nresponse $i_{R}$ (which can be assumed to be equal to $\\alpha\\cdot X$,\nwith $X$ representing the active induced response); b) a new cue\n(denoted CS) becomes paired with the source UCS in the first trial\nand, hence, an UCR associated with this UCS is elicited; c) in the\nfirst trial (i.e., for $n=1$) the strength $\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(1)}$\n(ranging from 0 to 1, as evidenced below) of the CS-UCS connection\n(which, in turn, is related to $i_{R}$; see Fig. 4) is equal to zero\n(in other words, no connection has been established before the start\nof the pairing process); d) the CS remains the same during all the\nconsidered trial; e) the UCS elicitation is signalled by the CS presentation\nonly and not by the UCS presentation (e.g., the electric shock device\nis permanently attached to the subject and the shock delivery is signalled\nexclusively by the CS presentation). In the following analysis the\nresponse elicited by the CS, previously named CR, is denoted $y_{CS}$.\nThen, in the first trial, an unexpected active UCS elicitation ($X$)\ngenerates the emotional response (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:solution-decomposition-d-a}))\n\n\n", "index": 91, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ny_{UCS}^{(1)}=X,\\label{eq:cond-y1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E46.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"y_{UCS}^{(1)}=X,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>y</mi><mrow><mi>U</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07766.tex", "nexttext": "\nduring a conditioned acquisition (through LTP), and as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 151751, "prevtext": "\nwhich is what was expected for the source UCS. However, since the\nUCS occurs unexpectedly in time, a reactive contribution due to the\n\\emph{contrast effect} (see Section \\ref{sub:contrast-effect}) should\nbe produced (provided that no previous conditioned cue or direct UCS\nperception signals the active stimulation). Nevertheless, in Section\n\\ref{sub:contrast-effect} it has been shown that successive unexpected\nUCS elicitations do not entail the computation of an error signal,\nbut certainly involve the elicitation of a reactive response due to\nthe contrast effect, (quantified by the product $K\\cdot X$). However,\nwithout any loss of generality, this reactive contribution can be\nneglected; furthermore, it can be noted that, during conditioning\ntrials, this contrast contribution will vanish (since no ``unexpected\nstimulation'' occurs as the CS becomes progressively able to predict\nthe UCS occurrence) and in place of this contribution the reactive\nresponse associated with the UCS ($i_{R}$) will be elicited as the\nCS is perceived (see Fig. 4). Even if no error signal has to be estimated\nfor the given UCS source during the first trial, the contemporary\npresence of the CS during the UCS elicitation is sufficient to generate\nsome synaptic connections between the representation of the CS and\nthat of the UCS through the stochastic Hebbian rule; consequently,\nthe strength of this link is potentiated through LTP. In the following\nit is also assumed that individual plastic synapses exhibit a binary\nbehavior, since they can be in a \\emph{depressed state} or in a \\emph{potentiated\nstate}. For this reason, the strength of a set of plastic synapses\nis quantified by the fraction of synapse population in the potentiated\nstate \\cite{Amit1994,Fusi2002,Fusi2007,Soltani2006,Soltani2010};\nthis fraction is called \\emph{synaptic strength} and in the $n$-th\ntrial is denoted as $\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n)}$ for the set of synapses\nfrom the neurons representing the CS stimulus onto the encoding neurons\nfor the UCS. \n\nThe mechanism through which plastic synapses learn cue-outcome contingencies\nthrough stochastic reward-dependent Hebbian modifications is illustrated\nin \\cite{Soltani2010}. In practice, whenever the neurons encoding\na given CS are simultaneously elicited at the activation of the UCS\nneurons, the plastic synapses from CS onto UCS in the depressed state\nmake a transition to the potentiated state with probability $\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}$\n(this quantity is called \\emph{potentiation rate}); otherwise, if\nthe CS is elicited without the contingent UCS elicitation, they make\na transition in the reverse direction with probability $\\hat{\\alpha}_{-}$\n(this quantity is called \\emph{depression rate}). It is worth mentioning\nthat the parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_{-}$ are\nofter called \\emph{learning rates} \\cite{Soltani2006} and that they\ndepend on the firing rate of the postsynaptic neurons of the CS and\non the state of the UCS (which is either active or non-active, that\nis eliciting or not eliciting UCS). The firing rate is low for the\nneurons which do not represent the perceived CS and, on the contrary,\nis high for the neurons encoding the CS. Hence, if the CS features\nare modified during the trials, the learning rates change too. In\nthe following, however, we assume that the CS perception does not\nchange during the trials (see H.4 in Section \\ref{sub:specific_hyp_discrete}),\nso that the depression and potentiation rates remain constant (and\ndifferent from zero). It is worth pointing out that the parameters\n$\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_{-}$ are scalar quantities\n(each of them would be replaced by a vector having identical components\nif multiple emotional components were considered in the evaluation\nof the reactive response) and they are not related to the parameter\n$\\alpha$ defined in Section \\ref{sub:Quantitative-analysis-d-a}\n(i.e., $\\alpha$ becomes also a vector, but with different components,\nif multiple emotional components are taken into consideration). \n\nOn the basis of the plastic probabilistic Hebbian rule illustrated\nabove, in the $n$-th trial the synaptic strenght is updated as\n\n\n", "index": 93, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n)}=\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n-1)}+\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}\\cdot\\left(1-\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n-1)}\\right)\\label{eq:strength-increase}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E47.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n)}=\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n-1)}+\\hat{\\alpha}_{+}\\cdot\\left(1-%&#10;\\omega_{CS-UCS}^{(n-1)}\\right)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c9</mi><mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>U</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c9</mi><mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>U</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mo>+</mo></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03c9</mi><mrow><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>U</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07766.tex", "nexttext": "\nduring the extinction phase (through LTD).

Our extended model provides\na more general and accurate description of the emotional response\nduring conditioning than the original Rescorla-Wagner model for at\nleast three different reasons. First of all, it includes the contributions\nof both the active response ($X$) due to the elicitation of the physical\nUCS and the reactive response associated with the UCS representation\nwithin the BLA ($i_{R}$). Moreover, the recursive equations describing\nit are \\emph{causal} unlike those representing the Rescorla-Wagner\nmodel. Note that causality ensures that the currently computed response\ndepends only on the past and present values of the stimulus and the\nresponse itself, but not on their future values; unluckily, this does\nnot occur for the Rescorla-Wagner model since the evaluation of the\ncurrent response requires the knowledge of the final asymptotic response\n(i.e., the term $\\lambda$ in Eq. (\\ref{eq:Rescorla-Wagner-Model})),\nwhich is actually unknown to the brain.

Such networks\nare able to represent complicated statistical regularities characterizing\nthe considered environment \\cite{Munakata2004,Soltani2010}; for instance,\ntemporal CS-UCS relations can be also learned assuming the \\emph{time}\nvariable\\emph{ }(and temporal relations between stimuli) as a contextual\nCS \\cite{Bouton1993}. We argue that, even during the implicit emotional\nlearning of the UCS, the temporal trend of the stimulation represents\nan important contextual information, which might be coded and stored.\nIn addition, we feel that more complicated Hebbian networks simultaneously\ntaking into account several variables could be able to predict more\nsophisticated phenomena related to classical conditioning paradigms\n(e.g., \\emph{second order conditioning} \\cite{Miller1995}).\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Conditioning to a reactive source stimulus \\label{sub:Conditioning-to-a-reactive-source}}\n\nWe argue that the following three possible events can occur when a\nCS is conditioned to a purely reactive UCS (i.e., an UCS for which\nno active component elicitation is expected, e.g., an emotional picture):\n1) a simple associative connection CS-UCS is generated; 2) the CS\nis misattributed to be the source of the elicited response, so becoming\na new (and independent) reactive source like the original UCS, so\nthat a new reactive response, equal (but independent) to the original\n$i_{R}$, is generated and associated to the CS; furthermore, this\nmisattribution process could occur even during the presentation of\nthe CS alone after conditioning, since the reactive elicitation equals\nto $\\omega_{CS-UCS}\\cdot i_{R}$ (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:ycs-init})) could\nbe misattributed forward the CS, in this case the reactive response\nbeing associated with CS corresponds to the quantity $\\omega_{CS-UCS}\\cdot i_{R}$;\n3) a combination of the previous two events happens. Moreover, if\none of the two last mentioned events occurs, the conditioned CS will\nbecome an inextinguishable element of emotional reaction. In summary,\nwe argue that a CS conditioned to a reactive UCS can become an inextinguishable\nreactive source of stimulation through different mechanisms; furthermore,\na given stimulus could act as both a CS and a primary stimulus (UCS)\nat the same time, owning even opposite valenced potentials; for instance,\nthe considered stimulus could be conditioned to an aversive UCS and,\nat the same time, could operate as an appetitive source of reactive\nstimulation. \n\n\n\\subsection{On the conditioned inhibitor}\n\nIn this Section the quantitative description of the so called \\emph{conditioned\ninhibitor }is developed on the basis of our theory.\n\nOperationally speaking, a conditioned inhibitor is a CS that passes\na negative summation and retardation tests for conditioned inhibition\n(see \\cite{Miller1995} and articles therein). A CS is said to pass\na negative summation test for conditioned inhibition if, when it is\npresented together with a conditioned excitor (i.e., a CS wich has\nbeen paired with an UCS), it reduces the level of conditioned responding\nto that excitor that would otherwise occur. Moreover, a CS is said\nto pass a retardation test for conditioned inhibition if it requires\na larger number of pairings with the UCS to become an effective conditioned\nexcitor than those required if the CS were novel \\cite{Miller1995}\n(i.e., if the CS had not undergone inhibitory training).\n\nThe most widely used method to create a conditioned inhibitor consists\nof not reinforcing the intended inhibitory CS in the presence of another\ncue that itself has been previously reinforced \\cite{Miller1995}.\nLet us analyze the conditioned inhibition on the basis of the model\nwe proposed for emotional learning. \n\nOne of the main assumptions made in the development of our model is\nthat the functions involved in the computation of emotional reactions\nare time invariant (see Section \\ref{sub:General-hypothesis}). Under\nthis assumption, if in a sequence of trials an UCS elicits a subject\nthat always maintains the same internal physiological states (for\ninstance, this case is exemplified by a dog that undergoes some conditioninng\ntrials, pairing a ring and some food, in which the intensity of its\nhunger remains the same), the only source of variation of the response\n(and of the expected outcome) is represented by the learning process.\nFor this reasons, if the expected outcome for an UCS after the first\nelicitation trial is equal to $X$, the reactive response associated\nwith the UCS ($i_{R}$) is equal to $\\alpha X$ (see Eqs. (\\ref{eq:Ii1},\n\\ref{eq:approx-famygdala} and \\ref{eq:approx-fchain})), whereas\nthe asymptotic value is equal to $\\alpha X/(1-\\alpha)$ (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:asymptotic reactive})).\nHence, in both cases, the reactive response $i_{R}$ is expressed\nby \n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 164397, "prevtext": "\nshould be adopted when employing them. Our extended model provides\na more general and accurate description of the emotional response\nduring conditioning than the original Rescorla-Wagner model for at\nleast three different reasons.

Moreover, the recursive equations describing\nit are \\emph{causal} unlike those representing the Rescorla-Wagner\nmodel. Note that causality ensures that the currently computed response\ndepends only on the past and present values of the stimulus and the\nresponse itself, but not on their future values; unluckily, this does\nnot occur for the Rescorla-Wagner model since the evaluation of the\ncurrent response requires the knowledge of the final asymptotic response\n(i.e., the term $\\lambda$ in Eq.

It is also important to point out that, if the condition\n$y'(t^{+})=0\\:\\textrm{and }x(t^{+})=0$ occurs again at a successive\ninstant $t=t^{+}$, a new purely reactive response is elicited and\nthe model (\\ref{eq:cont_time-1}) can be adopted to represent it.\nTherefore, our mathematical model leads to the conclusion that an\ninextinguishable\\footnote{The adjective \\emph{inextinguishable} is employed to indicate that\nthe source of stimulation cannot be extinguished through simple repetitive\nexpousures.} reactive response to a given source of stimulation (e.g., an electric\nshock source or an acoustic noise source) can be obtained through\na suitable choice of the dynamics of an induced active response and\nthat, in principle, this emotional reaction could be indefinitely\nstrenghtened by repeating similar dynamics. \n\nNote also that, in order to obtain a reactive resistant-to-extinction\nresponse, the dynamics of the active emotional response $x(t)$ have\nto meet specific conditions, which, in turn, depend on the dynamics\nof the physical features (e.g., electric voltage, frequency and amplitude\nof a noise sound, etc.) of the adopted source. In other words, it\nshould be expected that a specific mapping function between the features\nof a given physical source and the corresponding active emotional\nresponse induced by it exists. If this function is known, the physical\nfeatures of the source can be controlled in a way to generate specific\ndynamics in the active response; this, in turn, results in the generation\nof an inextinguishable form of emotional reactive response. Therefore,\nthese theoretical findings suggest that, in principle, the inertial\nnature of the \\emph{emotional dynamic system} can be exploited to\noriginate a resistant-to-extinction emotional reaction.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the asymptotic response which is obtained\nfrom the Eq. (\\ref{eq:cont_time}) assuming $T=1$ and a costant active\nelicitation (i.e., $x(t)=X$) is $y=X/(1+\\alpha)$. This last result\nshows that if a continuous active and constant elicitation occurs\nover time, the overall response reaches the same asymptotic value\nwhich is reached in the discrete-time model during successive trials\n(see Eq.(\\ref{eq:fixed-point-d-a})). \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that an ``hybrid'' time scale should\nbe adopted, in some cases, in real world; for instance we could have\ndifferent discrete trials, each of which is sufficiently extended\nover time so that the continuous time model should be used to analyse\nit (note that this type of time scale is indicated by $\\mathcal{\\mathfrak{\\mathscr{\\mathbb{P}}}}$\nin \\cite{Bohner2001}). In this case both the discrete model and the\ncontinuous time model have to be employed to describe the dynamics\nof emotional learning.\n\n\n\\subsection{On the inclusion of contrast effects in the proposed continuous time\nemotional model \\label{sub:contrast-continuous}}\n\nIn the case of a continuous time source of stimulation (e.g., a continuous\nacoustic stimulation, such as music) contrast effects can be exploited\nto evoke specific emotional responses. It is well known that music\nis able to evoke emotions, for instance, violating expectations or\nshifting in time the rewards in a balanced mechanism based on frustration\n(i.e., tension, as a state of dissonance, instability and uncertainty\n\\cite{Joseph2015}) and satisfaction (resolution towards consonant\nand stable sounds experienced as pleasurable) \\cite{Koelsch2014}.\nViolation or retardation in resolution produces a tension increase\nwhich may result in a successive stronger satisfaction during resolution\n\\cite{Joseph2015}. In this scenario, the contrast effect can explain,\nfor instance, why a slowly increasing tension could result in a successive\nhigher pleasure and rewarding effect after a sudden and unexpected\nresolution. A qualitative description of the contrast effect on a\ncontinuous time scale is expressed in Berlyne's \\emph{``arousal jag''\ntheory} \\cite{Berlyne1960}, which postulates that a drop from unusually\nhigh level of arousal (which is experienced as unpleasant) to a low\nlevel is associated with a feeling of pleasure \\cite{Joseph2015}.\nApparently, the low level arousal alone is not able to elicit a pleasure\nresponse; this means that only the \\emph{contrast} between arousal\nlevels produces an emotional pleasure (i.e., a contrast effect). These\nconsiderations motivate our interest in including the contrast effect\nin our continuous-time dynamic model for the emotional system. Unluckily,\nthe discrete-time counterpart described in the Section \\ref{sub:contrast-effect}\nis nonlinear; consequently, the procedure adopted in the derivation\nof Eq. (\\ref{eq:differential_eq}) cannot be applied to this case.\nHence, the contrast effect on a continuous time scale can be analysed\nby numerical simulation. A less refined approach is based on linearizing\nthe function $C(e_{A};T)$ (see Eq.(\\ref{eq:contrast-function}))\nand applying the bilinear transform method to derive a new differential\nequation. In particular, if the Eq. (\\ref{eq:approximated-contrast-d})\nis adopted for the modeling of the contrast effect (and assuming that\n$0<K<1$), the bilinear transform method applied to Eq.

In\npractice, as the value taken on by the argument $x$ grows, the corresponding\nvalue $f(x)$ of the function does not steadily increase in proportion\nto it and, when $x$ crosses a certain threshold, a certain saturation\nlevel is reached; in other words, $f(x)$ exhibits a \\emph{nonlinear}\nbehavior for sufficiently large values of $x$. In particular, these\nconsiderations hold for the \\emph{system chain function} $F_{Ch}(x)$\ndefined in our dynamic model (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:yn-d-a})) and involved\nin the computation of the emotional reaction, and for the \\emph{amygdala\nfunction} $F_{A}(x)$ (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:function_amygdala})). In\nthe following, we focus on the second function and analyse the implications\nof its nonlinear behevior; similar considerations, however, can be\nexpressed for the system chain function. In developing our model of\nUCS revaluation (see Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}),\nwe have assumed that $F_{A}(x)$ can be approximated as a linear function\n(see Eq. (\\ref{eq:approx-famygdala})) if in the $n$-th trial (or\nat a specific time instant) the error signal takes on a value smaller\nthan a \\emph{saturation threshold} $T_{S}$, which defines the linearization\nrange for $F_{A}(x)$ (see Fig. 6).\n\nIf, however, the error signal exceeds the saturation threshold $T_{S}$\n(i.e., if the error signal becomes excessively large), a phenomenon\nof \\emph{emotional saturation} should be expected. This phenomenon\ncould occur during an extremely traumatic event, represented by a\nunique event over a continuous time scale (see Section \\ref{sec:Emotional-Response-Dynamics}),\nor by an event involving successive acquisition trials and stimulations\non a discrete time scale (see Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}).\nIt is worth noting, for instance, that if during a continuous-time\nactive elicitation the reactivity of the amygdala is relatively high\n(which could be increased by the stress hormones and other factors\nrelated to stress \\cite{Kim2002}), the parameter $\\alpha$ increases\naccordingly (see Eqs. (\\ref{eq:approx-famygdala}-\\ref{eq:alfa}),\nso that the reached asymptotic response, which can be expressed as\n$y=X/(1-\\alpha)$ (see Eq. (\\ref{eq:fixed-point-d-a}) and Section\n\\ref{sub:continuous_model}) could grow until several times the intensity\nof the active elicitation $X$ (for instance if $\\alpha=0.9$ then\n$y=10\\cdot X$). It is also worth to mention that a purely reactive\nresponse could grow until a saturation level in the absence of any\nactive stimulations, for instance through the so called ``social\nlearning of fear'' \\cite{OlssonA2007,Olsson2007}. When emotional\nsaturation occurs, the source of stimulation (or any associated cue)\ngenerating it could produce inextinguishable effects, even in the\nabsence of an active component (which corresponds to the term $X$\nin eq. (\\ref{eq:yn-d-a})). In fact, in the linear case, a purely\nreactive elicitation in the absence of an active component (i.e.,\nwith $X=0$) leads to a negative error signal, since an active component\nis expected. In turn this error signal weakens the amygdala response\n(i.e., more precisely it produces a reduction by the amount $-\\gamma\\cdot X$;\nsee Eqs. (\\ref{eq:function_amygdala}, \\ref{eq:approx-famygdala})),\nand hence leads to the extinction through successive trials (see Eq.\n(\\ref{eq:solution-d-e})). Conversely, if the amygdala function has\npreviously reached its saturation level, in the first trial of reactive\nelicitation in the absence of the active component (e.g., a purely\nreactive visual or auditory cue triggers the reactive emotional response\nassociated with the considered traumatic event) the computed negative\nerror signal is unable to reduce the amygdala response. Hence, in\nthe successive trials the error signal becomes equal to zero and no\nresponse updating occurs. More specifically, this is true if the error\nsignal computed in the first trial, whose amplitude is equal to that\nof the expected active component (i.e., $e_{1}=-X$), is smaller than\nthe saturation level reached by the amygdala function (see Fig. 6).\nThese considerations lead us to the conclusion that any stimulus perception,\neven in the absence of an active elicitation, can trigger a reactive\nemotional response. This holds both for the perception of the source\nof stimulation and for any related cue; in fact, a cue (CS) conditioned\nto the source (UCS) can trigger the reactive response associated with\nthe UCS (i.e., $i_{R}$), and since such a response is evident and\nconstant at every trial (i.e., the error signal is equal to zero)\nthe contingency between CS and the UCR ($i_{R}$) is reinforced at\nevery trial. Furthermore, the considerations made in the Section \\ref{sub:Conditioning-to-a-reactive-source}\nabout a cue conditioned to a purely reactive source of stimulation\napply to this case too. We argue that this phenomenon could happen\nin panic disorders and PTSD \\cite{book_traumatic2012,Parsons2013,Perusini2016}.\nAs a matter of fact, in some forms of PTSD and panic disorders the\nmere repetitive exposure to cues related to a traumatic event does\nnot lead to an extinction of emotional responses or results in a very\nslow extinction \\cite{Paunovic1999,Perusini2016,vanRooij2015}. It\nis worth noting that during the reactive stimulation (e.g., a panic\nattack) other previously neutral cues could be associated (i.e., conditioned\nor misattributed) to the occuring reactive response, and successively\nthese cues might trigger the reactive response; hence, in turn, this\nphenomenon can lead to a generalization of triggered panic attacks\n(i.e., panic disorders). Note that the standard classical conditioning\nmodel is unable able to explain these psychopathologies. Nevertheless,\none might argue that in PTSD patients the traumatic stimulus is generally\nperceived in a context (and also in the presence of boundary conditions)\nthat differ from the one which originally caused the emotional response\nsaturation. Hence, the different perceived context should lead to\nan (at least partial) inhibition of the elicited reactive response.\nNonetheless, it should be kept into account that: a) the inhibitory\nstrength originating from the discrimination of the contextual information\ncould be smaller than the degree of saturation reached by the amygdala\nresponse during the considered traumatic event (see Fig. 6); b) contextual\ninformation are primarily coded and stored in the hippocampus (conversely,\nthe representation of an aversive stimulus is coded within the BLA),\nso that, if during the traumatic event the hippocampus does not properly\ncode contextual information, then no effective contextual discrimination\ncan be obtained during further expousures of the stimulus. As far\nas this last point is concerned, it is worth mentioning that hippocampus\nfunctioning and its ability to encode information (especially contextual\ninformation) are impaired by uncontrollable stress (see \\cite{Kim2002}\nfor a review on this topic). In particular, it is well known that\nthe hippocampus of a mammalian brain is a target of stress hormones\nsince it has one of the highest concentrations of receptors for \\emph{corticosteroids}.\nConsequently, certain hippocampal functions, such as learning and\nmemory, are susceptible to disruption by stress partly mediated by\ncorticosteroid receptors (mainly by the \\emph{glucocorticoid receptors},\nGRs). Interestingly, the model developed in \\cite{Kim2002} shows\nthat alterations in hippocampal functioning require both stress hormones\nand the active output from the amygdala, which in turn projects both\ndirectly and indirectly to the hippocampus. For this reason, the amygdala\noutput is a crucial component on the stress-induced modulation of\nhippocampal plasticity; in fact, when there is an experimentally induced\nreduction in the amygdalar input to the hippocampus (as a result of\nan inactivation or damage of the amygdala), plasticity in the hippocampus\nremains intact under stress conditions \\cite{Kim2002}. These results\nsupport our hypothesis according to which the saturation of the amygdala\nresponse during an extreme traumatic event, together with the release\nof the stress hormones, could lead to an impairment of the hippocampus\nfunctioning and contextual information encoding. In parallel, the\nsaturation of an emotional response component could cancel the effect\nof the error signal, which, on the contrary, in physiological conditions\nshould produce an extinguishment of the emotional response in few\ntrials. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that cronic stress (e.g., PTSD) may induces\nhippocampus atrophy \\cite{Bremner1999} and impair neurogenesis, specifically\nin the DG \\cite{Kim2002}. This, in turn, may lead to a greater generalization\nof anxiety disorders, in the impairment of emotional reactions inhibition\nand of contextual cue processing \\cite{vanRooij2015}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\noindent \\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics{figure6}\n\\par\\end{centering}\n\n\\caption{Schematic representation of the biological behavior of the amygdala\nfunction $F_{A}(x)$ in its linear zone a) and in its saturation zone\nb).

In particular, the case\nb) occurs if the negative error signal (due, for instance, to the\nfact that the active response $x$ is no more elicited during the\nstimulation) is smaller than the degree of saturation reached by the\namygdala in the previous stimulation(s).}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{On the reactive response to a stimulus under drug administration\\label{sub:reactive-versus-active}}\n\nThe proposed dynamic model can be also exploited to analyse the emotional\nresponse over multiple trials when a reactive (and resistant-to-extinction)\nresponse is contrasted by an active drug treatment (e.g., an anxiolytic\ndrug is employed to lower an anxiety reaction or panic attack elicited\nby a given stimulus). Our interest in this analysis is motivated by\nthe possibility of quantitatively assessing the long term mitigation\nof an undesired pathological emotional reaction provided that it is\nadministered an active drug during the elicitation of a reactive response;\nin particular, we are interested in analysing the effects of the drug\nwithdrawal.\n\nOne might argue that, in the considered scenario, the mere exposition\nto the source stimulus during the administration of a suitable drug\ncould be effective in reducing or extinguishing an undesired pathological\nreactive response, such as those occurring in panic attacks, PTSD\nor phobias. Indeed, as shown in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of},\nif a negative error signal (due to a response reduction) is computed\nduring a trial expousure, the reactive response is modified accordingly,\nand this results in a less intense emotional reaction. Nonetheless,\nit can be shown that, after the trial in which the drug administration\nis suspendend, the reactive response asymptotically increases to its\noriginal value, that is to the value of the response occuring before\nthe trial in which drug was administred. In fact, this result is due\nto the computed error signal and holds in the absence of any cognitive\nmodulation of the reactive response (i.e., in the absence of emotional\n\\emph{reappraisal} \\cite{Banks2007}). \n\nIn our study of a reactive response contrasted by an active drug treatment\nit is assumed that a given stimulus produces an inextinguishable reactive\nresponse $i_{R}=Y_{0}$. Such a response could originate from different\nevents, like \\emph{response saturation} during a traumatic event (see\nSection \\ref{sub:saturation}) or repetitive energizing trials of\na reactive response through an \\emph{accumulation effect }(see Section\n\\ref{sub:Source-Misattribution:-quantitat}), or it can be natively\nstored within the amygdala \\cite{Ohman1994,Ohman1993} (e.g., arachnophobia).\nFor this reason, the initial condition\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 197597, "prevtext": "\n\n\nThe last result shows that the response $y(t)$ can considered as\nthe sum of two separate contributions, one representing the inextinguishable\nreactive response ($y_{1}$), the other one ($y_{2}(t)$) accounting\nfor the possible variations of the physical (active) elicited response\n$x(t)$. It is also important to point out that, if the condition\n$y'(t^{+})=0\\:\\textrm{and }x(t^{+})=0$ occurs again at a successive\ninstant $t=t^{+}$, a new purely reactive response is elicited and\nthe model (\\ref{eq:cont_time-1}) can be adopted to represent it.\nTherefore, our mathematical model leads to the conclusion that an\ninextinguishable\\footnote{The adjective \\emph{inextinguishable} is employed to indicate that\nthe source of stimulation cannot be extinguished through simple repetitive\nexpousures.} reactive response to a given source of stimulation (e.g., an electric\nshock source or an acoustic noise source) can be obtained through\na suitable choice of the dynamics of an induced active response and\nthat, in principle, this emotional reaction could be indefinitely\nstrenghtened by repeating similar dynamics. \n\nNote also that, in order to obtain a reactive resistant-to-extinction\nresponse, the dynamics of the active emotional response $x(t)$ have\nto meet specific conditions, which, in turn, depend on the dynamics\nof the physical features (e.g., electric voltage, frequency and amplitude\nof a noise sound, etc.) of the adopted source. In other words, it\nshould be expected that a specific mapping function between the features\nof a given physical source and the corresponding active emotional\nresponse induced by it exists. If this function is known, the physical\nfeatures of the source can be controlled in a way to generate specific\ndynamics in the active response; this, in turn, results in the generation\nof an inextinguishable form of emotional reactive response. Therefore,\nthese theoretical findings suggest that, in principle, the inertial\nnature of the \\emph{emotional dynamic system} can be exploited to\noriginate a resistant-to-extinction emotional reaction.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the asymptotic response which is obtained\nfrom the Eq. (\\ref{eq:cont_time}) assuming $T=1$ and a costant active\nelicitation (i.e., $x(t)=X$) is $y=X/(1+\\alpha)$. This last result\nshows that if a continuous active and constant elicitation occurs\nover time, the overall response reaches the same asymptotic value\nwhich is reached in the discrete-time model during successive trials\n(see Eq.(\\ref{eq:fixed-point-d-a})). \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that an ``hybrid'' time scale should\nbe adopted, in some cases, in real world; for instance we could have\ndifferent discrete trials, each of which is sufficiently extended\nover time so that the continuous time model should be used to analyse\nit (note that this type of time scale is indicated by $\\mathcal{\\mathfrak{\\mathscr{\\mathbb{P}}}}$\nin \\cite{Bohner2001}). In this case both the discrete model and the\ncontinuous time model have to be employed to describe the dynamics\nof emotional learning.\n\n\n\\subsection{On the inclusion of contrast effects in the proposed continuous time\nemotional model \\label{sub:contrast-continuous}}\n\nIn the case of a continuous time source of stimulation (e.g., a continuous\nacoustic stimulation, such as music) contrast effects can be exploited\nto evoke specific emotional responses. It is well known that music\nis able to evoke emotions, for instance, violating expectations or\nshifting in time the rewards in a balanced mechanism based on frustration\n(i.e., tension, as a state of dissonance, instability and uncertainty\n\\cite{Joseph2015}) and satisfaction (resolution towards consonant\nand stable sounds experienced as pleasurable) \\cite{Koelsch2014}.\nViolation or retardation in resolution produces a tension increase\nwhich may result in a successive stronger satisfaction during resolution\n\\cite{Joseph2015}. In this scenario, the contrast effect can explain,\nfor instance, why a slowly increasing tension could result in a successive\nhigher pleasure and rewarding effect after a sudden and unexpected\nresolution. A qualitative description of the contrast effect on a\ncontinuous time scale is expressed in Berlyne's \\emph{``arousal jag''\ntheory} \\cite{Berlyne1960}, which postulates that a drop from unusually\nhigh level of arousal (which is experienced as unpleasant) to a low\nlevel is associated with a feeling of pleasure \\cite{Joseph2015}.\nApparently, the low level arousal alone is not able to elicit a pleasure\nresponse; this means that only the \\emph{contrast} between arousal\nlevels produces an emotional pleasure (i.e., a contrast effect). These\nconsiderations motivate our interest in including the contrast effect\nin our continuous-time dynamic model for the emotional system. Unluckily,\nthe discrete-time counterpart described in the Section \\ref{sub:contrast-effect}\nis nonlinear; consequently, the procedure adopted in the derivation\nof Eq. (\\ref{eq:differential_eq}) cannot be applied to this case.\nHence, the contrast effect on a continuous time scale can be analysed\nby numerical simulation. A less refined approach is based on linearizing\nthe function $C(e_{A};T)$ (see Eq.(\\ref{eq:contrast-function}))\nand applying the bilinear transform method to derive a new differential\nequation. In particular, if the Eq. (\\ref{eq:approximated-contrast-d})\nis adopted for the modeling of the contrast effect (and assuming that\n$0<K<1$), the bilinear transform method applied to Eq.

In\npractice, as the value taken on by the argument $x$ grows, the corresponding\nvalue $f(x)$ of the function does not steadily increase in proportion\nto it and, when $x$ crosses a certain threshold, a certain saturation\nlevel is reached; in other words, $f(x)$ exhibits a \\emph{nonlinear}\nbehavior for sufficiently large values of $x$. In particular, these\nconsiderations hold for the \\emph{system chain function} $F_{Ch}(x)$\ndefined in our dynamic model (see Eq.

In\nthe following, we focus on the second function and analyse the implications\nof its nonlinear behevior; similar considerations, however, can be\nexpressed for the system chain function. In developing our model of\nUCS revaluation (see Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}),\nwe have assumed that $F_{A}(x)$ can be approximated as a linear function\n(see Eq.

This phenomenon\ncould occur during an extremely traumatic event, represented by a\nunique event over a continuous time scale (see Section \\ref{sec:Emotional-Response-Dynamics}),\nor by an event involving successive acquisition trials and stimulations\non a discrete time scale (see Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of}).\nIt is worth noting, for instance, that if during a continuous-time\nactive elicitation the reactivity of the amygdala is relatively high\n(which could be increased by the stress hormones and other factors\nrelated to stress \\cite{Kim2002}), the parameter $\\alpha$ increases\naccordingly (see Eqs.

It is also worth to mention that a purely reactive\nresponse could grow until a saturation level in the absence of any\nactive stimulations, for instance through the so called ``social\nlearning of fear'' \\cite{OlssonA2007,Olsson2007}.

In fact, in the linear case, a purely\nreactive elicitation in the absence of an active component (i.e.,\nwith $X=0$) leads to a negative error signal, since an active component\nis expected. In turn this error signal weakens the amygdala response\n(i.e., more precisely it produces a reduction by the amount $-\\gamma\\cdot X$;\nsee Eqs. (\\ref{eq:function_amygdala}, \\ref{eq:approx-famygdala})),\nand hence leads to the extinction through successive trials (see Eq.\n(\\ref{eq:solution-d-e})).

Our interest in this analysis is motivated by\nthe possibility of quantitatively assessing the long term mitigation\nof an undesired pathological emotional reaction provided that it is\nadministered an active drug during the elicitation of a reactive response;\nin particular, we are interested in analysing the effects of the drug\nwithdrawal.\n\nOne might argue that, in the considered scenario, the mere exposition\nto the source stimulus during the administration of a suitable drug\ncould be effective in reducing or extinguishing an undesired pathological\nreactive response, such as those occurring in panic attacks, PTSD\nor phobias. Indeed, as shown in Section \\ref{sec:Quantitative-Analysis-of},\nif a negative error signal (due to a response reduction) is computed\nduring a trial expousure, the reactive response is modified accordingly,\nand this results in a less intense emotional reaction. Nonetheless,\nit can be shown that, after the trial in which the drug administration\nis suspendend, the reactive response asymptotically increases to its\noriginal value, that is to the value of the response occuring before\nthe trial in which drug was administred. In fact, this result is due\nto the computed error signal and holds in the absence of any cognitive\nmodulation of the reactive response (i.e., in the absence of emotional\n\\emph{reappraisal} \\cite{Banks2007}). \n\nIn our study of a reactive response contrasted by an active drug treatment\nit is assumed that a given stimulus produces an inextinguishable reactive\nresponse $i_{R}=Y_{0}$. Such a response could originate from different\nevents, like \\emph{response saturation} during a traumatic event (see\nSection \\ref{sub:saturation}) or repetitive energizing trials of\na reactive response through an \\emph{accumulation effect }(see Section\n\\ref{sub:Source-Misattribution:-quantitat}), or it can be natively\nstored within the amygdala \\cite{Ohman1994,Ohman1993} (e.g., arachnophobia).\nFor this reason, the initial condition\n\n\n", "index": 151, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ny_{0}=Y_{0}\\label{eq:init_cond}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E76.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"y_{0}=Y_{0}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>y</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>Y</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07766.tex", "nexttext": "\nso that the error signal computed in the first trial is\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 211049, "prevtext": "\nis given.

Nevertheless, as shown in the previous\nSection, a treatment based on an active drug alone could be unable\nto counteract the pathological reactive response on a long term (i.e.,\nafter the drug withdrawal). This means that active drugs, even if\nare able to mitigate the symptoms due to strong inextinguishable responses,\ncannot durably extinguish them. For this reason, the adoption of \\emph{reactive}\n\\emph{methods} (e.g., psychotherapy treatments \\cite{Lipka2014,Paunovic1999})\nable to extinguish (or mitigate) a pathological reactive response\nis required. These methods include all\\emph{ }the techniques\\emph{\n}able to counteract a pathological emotional response through an opposite\nreactive response or a reactive inhibition (consequently, the use\nof any active component is avoided). We argue that different technologies,\nlike optogenetic manipulation of memory engrams and memory photostimulation,\ncould be adopted to achieve this target. In fact, on the one hand,\nthe optogenetic manipulation of the memory engrams within the DG or\nthe BLA \\cite{Gore2015,Ramirez2015,Redondo2014} allows to switch\nthe valence of a CS in the DG from a positive (negative) UCS to an\nopposite one \\cite{Redondo2014}. Some results have evidenced that\nthe chronic reactivation of hippocampal cells associated with a positive\nmemory is able to suppress depression-like behavior in mice \\cite{Ramirez2015}.\nOn the other hand, the memory photostimulation of UCS-responsive cells\non the BLA has been shown to produce valence-specific behaviors \\cite{Gore2015}.\nOn the basis of the aforementioned results we argue that, if during\ntrials in which a subject is exposed to the cues related to a traumatic\nevent, positive valenced UCS-responsive cells were photostimulated,\nthen the outcome triggered by such cues (i.e., the target response)\ncould be weakened. In fact, the photostimulation-induced response\nshould be misattributed to the target cue and, consequently, the final\ncue-related outcome should be due to the superposition of the original\ntarget response with the optically elicited response; this should\nresult in a net decrease of the target response. Unluckily, optogenetic\nneuronal manipulations and memory photostimulation cannot be used\non humans today because of their invasiveness. We argue, however,\nthat similar reactive counteractions could be obtained through a subliminal\nexpousure, exploiting the \\emph{implicit accumulation effect }(see\nSection \\ref{sub:Source-Misattribution:-quantitat}). Finally, it\nis useful to mention that techniques exploiting the misattribution\nof reactive responses (both conditioned responses and purely reactive\nresponses) could be also employed to strengthen a desired response\n(e.g., an unconscious placebo response).\n\n\n\\part*{Discussion}\n\nIn this manuscript a novel theory of emotional learning has been illustrated.\nThe theory shows the differentiation (and the relations) between classical\nconditioning and the UCS revaluation, and provides various new insights\non well known psychophysiological phenomena and psychiatric diseases\n(e.g., panic disorders and PTSD), and a number of new ideas for further\nresearch. One of its most interesting implications is represented\nby the identification of well defined mathematical and neurophysiological\nconditions ensuring the inextinguishability of specific emotional\nreactions. In particular, it allows us to establish the following\nfour different mechanisms through which a stimulus can produce a resistant-to-extinction\nemotional reaction: 1)~misattribution of a reactive response (see\nCorollary 1); 2) classical conditioning of a stimulus to a purely\nreactive source of stimulation; 3) saturation of emotional response\n(e.g., of the amygdala reactive response); 4) the exploitation of\nthe inertial dynamics of emotional learning system on a continuous\ntime scale. Further relevant contributions are represented by the\nproof that the Rescorla-Wagner model for classical conditioning can\nbe obtained as a special case of the proposed model; the derivation\nof a new model for conditioning, which accounts for the implicit UCS\nrevaluation and that is able to quantitatively describe important\nexperimental results (such as the impossibility to extinguish a conditioned\ninhibitor through its repeated presentations), which are unpredictable\nby existing classical conditioning models. Indeed, classical conditioning\nhas been deeply studied in the last century, while UCS revaluation\ndid not obtain the due attention, and, for this reason, actually,\nappropriate analytical and experimental models for resistant-to-extinction\nresponses do not exist.\n\nOur result paves the way for various new research activities. First\nof all, various potential applications of our theory can be envisaged\nin the hot research area concerning the manipulation of human behaviours\nand emotional reactions. Note that our theory unveils the real differences\nbetween an UCS and a CS from the perspective of the emotional system\nand, in particular, shows that removing a CS does not ensure the extinction\nof an undesired emotional reaction, since, as long as a UCS reaction\nremain stored (or relatively strength), it is able to form other CS-UCS\nconnections, or to duplicate its associated reaction through a misattribution\neffect or even to strenghten itself through incubation mechanisms.\nFurthermore, if an UCS reaction is extinguished or weakened, all the\nassociated CSs are weakened. Thus, establishing a well defined differentiation\nbetween a cue (i.e., a CS) and a source of stimulation (i.e., UCS)\nis fundamental in order to eradicate an emotional undesired reaction.\nThis fundamental differentiation could be effectively assessed exploiting\n\\emph{Remark} (\\ref{rem:UCS-in-amygdala}), i.e. testing the subliminal\nemotional reactive response through subliminal exposure. Indeed, as\nshown in our analysis, no difference between CS and UCS might be sensed\nin the course of a supraliminar perception. In addition, from a conscious\nperspective, a source or a cue-stimulus could be hardly differentiated,\nbecause of misattribution effects or response duplications (e.g.,\nan initial CS could be misattributed and become an UCS); note also\nthese and other related attribution phenomena often occur automatically\nand unconsciously \\cite{Anderson1989,Uleman1987}, and are not explained\nby classical conditioning theory.\n\nAnother interesting research topic is represented by the potential\napplications of Corollary 1, i.e. by the possibility of devising UCSs\nable to elicitate reactive responses. Such responses could be strenghtened\nthrough an \\emph{accumulation effect} and potentially exploited to\nmodify the emotional reaction to a given stimulus (e.g., to weaken\nan opposite valenced emotional reaction or to enhance the unconscious\nplacebo effect of a drug \\cite{Jensen2012,Jensen2014}). The idea\nof generating an accumulated reactive response could be really useful\nfrom a therapeutic viewpoint since, in practice, the active modulation\nof a given reactive response (accomplished, for instance, through\nthe action of a pharmacological drug) vanishes over time if the associated\nactive component decays too (in the considered example this occurs\nif the administered drug is withdrawn). Furthermore, other ``reactive\nmethods'' could be exploited in order to modulate (i.e., to increase\nor decrease) a target response; these methods include but are not\nlimited to: the misattribution of a CR forward the target response,\nthe cognitive reappraisal of an emotional response \\cite{Banks2007}\n(e.g., psychotherapy), optogenetic manipulations \\cite{Gore2015,Ramirez2015,Redondo2014}. \n\nOnce again, it is worth stressing that these results rely on the differentation\nbetween the types of emotional response (such as \\emph{active}, \\emph{reactive}\nand \\emph{passive residual} responses) that can come into play during\na stimulation (and, more precisely, during UCS revaluation) and the\nconcepts of \\emph{source attribution} and \\emph{misattribution}, and\nthat these relevant factors are not taken into consideration in classical\nconditioning models.\n\nA further relevant research topic concerns the applications of our\nmodel of emotional learning on a continuous time scale. Generally\nspeaking, this model could be exploited to analyse the emotional reaction\ngenerated by any physical stimulation which varies continuosly over\ntime (e.g., a time-varying acoustic source of stimulation, such as\nmusic \\cite{Koelsch2014}). We feel, however, that our model is preliminary\nand that it should be improved by including some features of hippocampus\nfiltering (for instance, the temporal pattern recognition, that is\nthe detection of regular patterns within the time-varying elicited\nresponse, should be included). \n\nFinally, it is important to mention that our theoretical framework\ncan be exploited for the development of psychophysiological experimental\nmodels for both animals and humans; these, in turn, can potentially\nprovide new insights into emotion-related phenomena and pathologies.\n\n\\newpage{}\n\n\n\\section*{Appendix}\n\nIn this Appendix we describe an experiment useful to prove that the\nencoding of an aversive object as a conditioned stimulus (CS) to a\nprimary source of \\emph{punishment} (i.e., CS-UCS encoding through\naversive classical conditioning acquisition) or as a primary source\nof stimulation (UCS) involves different regions of the mammalian brain. \n\nThe procedure adopted in this experiment is obtained by including\na new part in the procedure followed in \\cite{Flykt2007} and is sketched\nbelow. The proposed experiment is based on the use of a specific device,\nnever observed by the involved subjects and having a neutral shape;\nthis device, however, is able to produce an aversive stimulus, like\nan electric shock or strong noise. Morever, it involves two distinct\ngroups of subjects, one denoted group+, the other one group-. In practice,\nthe experiment consists of three different phases, each involving\nmultiple trials. In the first phase the selected device has to directly\nelicit an aversive response for some trials in the members of group+,\nso that their emotional learning systems attribute the elicited responses\nto that source of stimulation, learn the associated reactive responses,\nand finally code and store them within their amygdalas. In the group-,\nthe same device has to be conditioned to an identical aversive response\nelicited in the group+; however, all the subjects of group- must be\naware of the fact that the aversive stimulus originates from another\nsource of stimulation (denoted UCSa) and must learn the stimulus contingencies\n(in other words, classical conditioning learning occurs for group-,\ninstead of the direct response attribution characterizing group+).\nIn particular, the picture of the new device pointed toward the subject\ncan be easily conditioned instead of the device itself (since, otherwise,\nit would be quite difficult to perform a conditioning procedure by\nwhich the physical object is paired with the UCSa elicitation). In\nthe second phase, a \\emph{differential conditioning} paradigm is adopted.\nFor this reason, each subject of group+ has to be conditioned with\nthe pairing of the picture of this device, pointed toward the subject\nand denoted CS+, with a new UCS (e.g. and electric shock); the last\nUCS, called UCSb, must be different from UCSa, that is employed for\nthe conditioning of group-. Moreover, another threatening element\n(e.g., a gun), called CS-, is presented to the subjects of group+\nin the absence of an UCS. The same procedure is followed for the subjects\nof group-; these have previously acquired the given device as a conditiond\ncue and not as a direct source of stimulation. Finally, in the third\nphase, a masked (unmasked) extinction phase for half subjects of group+\n(group-) will be able to reveal which CSs+ are able to elicit a differential\nautonomic response (i.e. a SCR) even under a subliminally (masked)\nperception. If group+ only will exhibit a differential autonomic response\nin the masked extinction (with respect to the SCR elicited by the\nmasked CS- perception), it will be inferred that only the representation\nof the CS+ within group+ can be activated through the sub-cortical\nthalamus-amygdala pathway; therefore, we will come to the conclusion\nthat the the representation of CS+ has been stored within the amygdala\nin the same site as other UCSs (e.g., phylogenetic or ontogenetic\nthreatening stimuli \\cite{Esteves1994,Flykt2007,Ohman1993,Ohman1993b,Ohman1994})\nhave been stored (i.e., the BLA). Conversely, if the subjects of group-\nare considered, the CS+ (which is the same picture as that employed\nfor group+), represents an aversive object which has not been stored\nwithin the BLA, or, in any case, not in a brain region activated by\nthe sub-cortical thalamo-amygdala pathway (like the phylogenetic or\nontogenetic stimuli).\n\nWe believe that, if the envisaged results will be obtained, they will\nalso definitively prove that the mechanism through which the selected\naversive object has been encoded (i.e., through classical conditioning\nacquisition, or by direct or implicit response attribution) makes\nthe difference.\n\n\\newpage{}\n\n\n\\section*{References }\n\n\\noindent \\bibliographystyle{vancouver/vancouver}\n\\bibliography{references_29-11sidita_APA}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 217041, "prevtext": "\nNote the last equation still contains the term $-\\bigtriangleup Y_{0}^{'}$,\nsince it originates directly from a reactive emotional downregulation\n(and it is not due to the computation of an error signal after that\nan active elicitation has been occured, like in the previous case;\nsee Eq.
