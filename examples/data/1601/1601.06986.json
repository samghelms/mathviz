In any case, the use of the circular orbit has a negligible effect\non the elements that define the binary masses.\nThe results can be found in Table~\\ref{spel90}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\caption[]{Orbital parameters and their uncertainties obtained with the program {\\hbox{\\tt SPEL}}.}\n\\label{spel90}\n\\begin{tabular}{rccc}\n\\hline\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\nElement&Value\\\\\n\\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n$P$  (d) &  4.30216 fixed\\\\\n$T_{\\rm min.I}$  (HJD) & $2454437.2359\\pm0.0046$ \\\\\n$K_1$  ({km~s$^{-1}$}) & $82.6\\pm0.6$\\\\\n$K_2$  ({km~s$^{-1}$}) & $123.1\\pm0.7$\\\\\n$q=K_1/K_2$  & $0.67\\pm0.01$\\\\\n$V_0$  ({km~s$^{-1}$}) & $-19.0\\pm0.4$ \\\\\n$a \\sin i$  ({R$_{\\odot}$}) & 17.5 \\\\\n\\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\\subsection{Improved linear ephemeris}\nHaving now two sets of photometric observations and\nnew RVs, which span a substantially longer time interval than before, we\ndecided to derive a new, more accurate linear ephemeris. To this end,\nwe first used the program {\\hbox{\\tt PHOEBE }} 1.0 \\citep{prsa2005, prsa2006}, which\nis an extension of the widely used WD program \\citep{wd71}.\nAs mentioned above, \\citet{vio2008} obtained the first $V$-band light curve\nof the {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } and derived a linear ephemeris. Later, \\citet{ozdar2012}\npublished a new ephemeris based on their {\\hbox{$U\\!B{}V$}}\\ light curves.\nWe combined all four LCs with our {\\hbox{\\tt SPEFO }} RVs to obtain the following\nlinear ephemeris:\n\\smallskip\\noindent\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nT_{\\rm min.I}={\\rm HJD}\\, 2454437.2480(13)+4\\fd302152(1)\\times E\\,.\\label{efe2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"T_{\\rm min.I}={\\rm HJD}\\,2454437.2480(13)+4\\fd 302152(1)\\times E\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>min</mi><mo>.</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">I</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>HJD</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>\u20092454437.2480</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>13</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\fd</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>302152</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u00d7</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>E</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06986.tex", "nexttext": "\n\\noindent where $m$ is the number of pixels used in the wavelength interval.

First,\n\nwe kept all elements fixed and ran the program for several different\nvalues of the semi-amplitude $K_1$ to find out which one gives the lowest\nsum of squares of the residuals. This indicated $K_1\\sim81$~{km~s$^{-1}$ }\nas the optimal value (see the upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{mapping}). Keeping this\nvalue fixed, we carried out a similar mapping to obtain the best guess for\nthe mass ratio $q = K_1 / K_2$. The result is shown in the bottom panel of\nFig.~\\ref{mapping} ($q\\sim0.66$).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[scale=0.45,angle=270]{K1.eps}\n   \\includegraphics[scale=0.45,angle=270]{q.eps}\n      \\caption{Sum of squares of residuals for trial {\\hbox{\\tt KOREL }} solutions\nwith fixed elements as a function of (a) the semi-amplitude $K_1$ (upper panel),\nand (b) the mass ratio $K_1/K_2$ (lower panel).}\n         \\label{mapping}\n\\end{figure}\n\nStarting with these values, we then carried out a series of {\\hbox{\\tt KOREL }} solutions,\nbut now allowing the free convergence of the epoch $T_{\\rm min.I}$, semi-amplitude\n$K_1$, and the mass ratio $q=K_1/K_2$ and variously kicking away the initial values\nfrom the adopted values.\nThe solution that gives the lowest sum of squares of residuals are shown in\nTable ~\\ref{korelRV}, and the corresponding disentangled spectra of\nthe components are shown in Fig.~\\ref{disenspec}.\nWe note that the {\\hbox{\\tt SPEL }} solution based on RVs measured in {\\hbox{\\tt SPEFO }}\ndoes not differ significantly from the optimal {\\hbox{\\tt KOREL }} solution.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\caption[]{Best trial orbital solution with {\\hbox{\\tt KOREL }} (see the text for the estimation procedure of the error bars).}\n\\label{korelRV}\n\\begin{tabular}{rccrrrrr}\n\\hline\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\nElement&Value\\\\\n\\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n$P$  (d) &  4.302152 fixed\\\\\n$T_{\\rm min.I}$  (HJD) &  2454437.26469  \\\\\n$K_1$  ({km~s$^{-1}$})&  $80.8\\pm1.1$ \\\\\n$K_2$  ({km~s$^{-1}$})&  $124.1\\pm1.3$ \\\\\n$q$ &  $0.650\\pm0.015$ \\\\\n$a sini$  ({R$_{\\odot}$})&  17.4 \\\\\n\\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n   \\centering\n   \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n   {\\includegraphics[scale=0.45,angle=270]{disen1.eps}}&{\\includegraphics[scale=0.45,angle=270]{disen2.eps}}\\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Disentangled spectra of primary (left panel) and secondary (right panel) components obtained with {\\hbox{\\tt KOREL}}.}\n         \\label{disenspec}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n  The  {\\hbox{\\tt KOREL }} program does not provide error estimates of individual\nparameters. However, certain error estimates can be obtained\nas follows.  First, since there is a good agreement between the results\nfrom RVs directly measured with {\\hbox{\\tt SPEFO }} and those from {\\hbox{\\tt KOREL}}, one can\nadopt the $K$ and $q$ errors from the {\\hbox{\\tt SPEL }} solution in Table 2 as being\nquite representative of real uncertainties. Secondly, we can also estimate\nuncertainties of ${K_1}$ and ${K_2}$ from the RV measurements\ngiven in Table ~\\ref{jourv}. According to the values in\nTable ~\\ref{jourv}, our RV measurements have mean errors of 0.63 and 1.1 {km~s$^{-1}$ }\nfor the primary and secondary components, respectively. These values are\nalso in  good agreement with the $K$ errors in Table~\\ref{spel90}.\nThirdly, a close inspection of the rather flat minima in Fig.~\\ref{mapping}\nsuggests errors of $\\sigma_{K_1}$=2 {km~s$^{-1}$ } and $\\sigma_{q}$= 0.02 for $K_1$\nand $q$, respectively.\nTherefore, finally, we  adopt the average errors of $\\sigma_{K_1}$=1.1 {km~s$^{-1}$},\n$\\sigma_{K_2}$=1.3 {km~s$^{-1}$}, and $\\sigma_{q}$= 0.015 for $K_1$, $K_2$ and $q$,\nrespectively.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{A comparison of disentangled and observed spectra with\nsynthetic ones}\nTo obtain the estimates of the effective temperatures, gravity accelerations,\nand projected rotational velocities from spectroscopy, we used two independent\nprocedures.\n\nFirst we used a~program which compares synthetic spectra with disentangled or observed\nspectra of multiple systems to estimate radiative properties of its\ncomponents  \\citep[see][for the details]{nasseri2014}.\nThe program uses several pre-calculated grids of synthetic spectra.\nThe primary falls within parameters covered with\ngrid POLLUX~\\citep{palacios2010} and the secondary falls\nwithin grid AMBRE~\\citep{delaverny2012}. The wavelength band\n$\\Delta\\lambda\\in\\lbrace{6330-6695\\rbrace}$\\,\\r{A} was fitted.\nThe optimized parameters were the effective temperature,\nthe~projected rotational velocity, the systemic radial velocity,\nand the relative luminosity\\footnote{The total luminosity was\nconstrained as follows: $L_{1}+L_{2}=1.0$.} of both components.\nThe result is presented in Column~2 of Table~\\ref{specres}.\n\nUncertainties of fitted parameters were estimated with a\nMonte Carlo simulation, which was carried out as follows:\n1) The continuum $\\sigma_{\\rm c}$ noise was estimated\nfor each disentangled spectrum, using the same procedure as the previous section.\n2) An artificial Gaussian  noise with $\\sigma=\\sigma_{\\rm c}$\nwas added to the disentangled profile.\n3) The adjusted disentangled spectrum was fitted.\nThis procedure was repeated 500 times and\nthe errors were estimated from the distribution of\nresults from all runs.\nThese uncertainties do not reflect the need for\nthe~re-normalization of disentangled profiles.\nThis step especially affects  the width of H\\,$\\alpha$\nline and, consequently, the obtained parameters, particularly\nthe gravitational acceleration and the projected velocity.\nThe gravitational acceleration was estimated from\nthe light curve solution and fixed during the fitting of disentangled\nspectra, but the projected rotational velocity was fitted.\n\nTo test the reliability of the estimated projected rotational\nvelocity, another fit that followed the same procedure was\ncomputed, but the fitted wavelength range was only\n$\\Delta\\lambda\\in\\lbrace{6342-6350; 6368-6374\\rbrace}$\\,\\r{A}. This region contains a pair of silicon lines\n\\ion{Si}{II}{\\,6347}\\,\\r{A} and \\ion{Si}{II}{\\,6371}\\,\\r{A}, which\nshould be unaffected by the re-normalization uncertainty.\nThe optimal rotational velocities are $v_1\\sin i = 32.55 \\pm 0.59$\\,{km~s$^{-1}$}, and\n$v_2\\sin i = 22.1 \\pm 1.2$\\,{km~s$^{-1}$}. This shows that\nthe true uncertainty of the rotational velocity\nof secondary is $\\sim10$\\,{km~s$^{-1}$}.\n\nAs an independent approach to determine the effective temperatures of the components we used the program {\\tt COMPO2}\nwritten by \\citet{Fras2006}, which combines two reference spectra for both components for given effective temperatures, radial velocities (or systematic velocity), projected rotational velocities, and gravitational accelerations and compare the combined spectrum to the observed spectrum of a binary system. To achieve this, we used the reference spectra taken from \\citet{val2004} and tried to reproduce our observed spectrum taken at maximum orbital elongations (0.75 phase). {\\tt COMPO2} tries to minimize the residuals between observed and composite spectra to find optimal parameter values for effective temperature and fractional flux contributions. The results of this procedure are listed in Column 3 of Table~\\ref{specres}. As seen from the table, both methods estimate almost the same values for the primary's effective temperature. However the relative contributions of the components to the total luminosity in the spectral regions under consideration  do differ somewhat from each other.\n\n \\begin{table}\n \\centering\n \\caption[]{Properties of the binary components of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } estimated\nfrom the comparison of the disentangled (Column~2) and observed (Column~3)\nspectra with synthetic ones (see the text for details).}\n \\label{specres}\n \\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}\n \\hline\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n Elements&Disentangled & Observed\\\\\n \\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n $T_\\mathrm{eff,1}$  (K) & $10500\\pm340$ & $10400\\pm420$ \\\\\n $T_\\mathrm{eff,2}$  (K) & $7180\\pm850$ & $7600\\pm880$ \\\\\n ${{\\rm log}~$g$ }_{1}$  [cgs] & $4.29^{1}$ & $4.31\\pm0.07$ \\\\\n ${{\\rm log}~$g$ }_{2}$ [cgs] & $4.29^{1}$ & $4.29\\pm0.04$ \\\\\n $L_1/L_\\mathrm{tot}$ & $0.74\\pm0.01^{2}$ & $0.80\\pm0.02^{2}$ \\\\\n $L_2/L_\\mathrm{tot}$ & $0.26\\pm0.01^{2}$ & $0.20\\pm0.02^{2}$ \\\\\n $v_1\\sin i$ ({km~s$^{-1}$}) & $29.1\\pm1.1$  & -- \\\\\n $v_2\\sin i$ ({km~s$^{-1}$}) & $30.7\\pm4$  & -- \\\\\n $\\gamma_1$ ({km~s$^{-1}$}) & $-18.1\\pm0.2$ & -- \\\\\n $\\gamma_2$ ({km~s$^{-1}$}) & $-17.5\\pm0.6$ & -- \\\\\n \\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n \\end{tabular}\n \\tablefoot{$^1$The gravitational acceleration\n was fixed a value obtained from the light curve solution. $^2$These values represent the luminosity ratio for the studied spectral region.}\n \\end{table}\n\n\n\\subsection{Simultaneous solution of light and radial velocity curves with {\\hbox{\\tt PHOEBE}}}\\label{pho}\nThe final solution to obtain the binary masses, radii, and luminosities\nwas carried out with the program {\\hbox{\\tt PHOEBE}}.

The limb-darkening\ncoefficients $\\it x_{1,2}$ were computed automatically by {\\hbox{\\tt PHOEBE }} from internal tables of the programme which were generated according to the models given by \\citet{cas2004}. Convergence was allowed for\nthe epoch of primary minimum\n$T_{\\rm min.I}$, the orbital period $P$, the semi-major axis of the relative orbit {\\it a},\nsystemic velocity {\\it $V_\\gamma$}, orbital inclination {\\it i},\ndimensionless surface potentials of the components {\\it $\\Omega_1$} and\n{\\it $\\Omega_2$}, the effective temperature of the secondary component\n$T_\\mathrm{eff,2}$, mass ratio {\\it q,} and relative monochromatic luminosities\nof the primary component $L_1$ in individual photometric pass-bands.\n\nTo refine the temperatures of the primary component, which we obtained in previous sections, we applied an $T_\\mathrm{eff,1}$ search procedure.\nWe subsequently solved the RV and LC curves simultaneously for a number\nof fixed values of $T_\\mathrm{eff,1}$ between 10000 K - 11250 K.\nThe run of the weighted sum of the square of residuals ($\\chi^2$=$[\\Sigma$W$(O-C)^2]$) thus obtained as a~function of the effective\ntemperature of the primary is shown in Fig ~\\ref{T1sear}.\nAs can be seen from the figure, $\\chi^2$ has its lowest value around $T_\\mathrm{eff,1}$=10450 K which agrees with $T_\\mathrm{eff,1}$=$10750\\pm450$ K given by \\citet{ozdar2012} within the uncertainty bars, and so for the final solution we adopted $T_\\mathrm{eff,1}$=10450 K.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\hspace*{-0.5cm}\n    \\includegraphics[scale=0.52,angle=270]{temp.eps}\n      \\caption{Search for the best value of the effective temperature ($T_\\mathrm{eff,1}$) for primary component with {\\hbox{\\tt PHOEBE }} solutions.}\n         \\label{T1sear}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe final results are shown in Table~\\ref{final}.

These are summarised in Table~\\ref{pyhs}. The masses of\nthe primary and secondary components are consistent with the spectral\ntypes A3 V and F2 V, respectively. Using the observed {\\it V}-band magnitude\noutside the eclipses and ({\\hbox{$U\\!-\\!B$}}) and ({\\hbox{$B\\!-\\!V$}}) colours given by \\citet{ozdar2012},\nthe relative luminosities from the {\\hbox{\\tt PHOEBE }} solution, and the bolometric\ncorrections  from \\citet{gra2005}, we calculated the de-reddened magnitudes,\ncolours, distance moduli and the distances of the components. These are also\ngiven in Table~\\ref{pyhs}. Considering that the primary is much brighter\nthan the secondary, we weighted the individually derived distances to the components with their luminosities and estimated the mean distance to the system as $\\overline{d}=330\\pm29$~pc.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{evtrck} we show the positions of the components in\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, with the ZAMS line taken from \\citet{gim89} for the\nsolar composition.

To do so, we first shifted\nthe theoretical main sequence along the ({\\hbox{$B\\!-\\!V$}}) axis for a given value of\n$E$({\\hbox{$B\\!-\\!V$}}), and then determined the value of the distance modulus by hand, to find the smallest standard deviation $\\sigma(m-M)$ for\nthe differences between the theoretical and observed main sequences.\nConsequently, the resulting value of the distance modulus corresponds to\nthe smallest error of distance $d$ for the value of the corresponding $E$({\\hbox{$B\\!-\\!V$}}),\ntoo. The procedure was then repeated with a new value for the reddening.\nWe show the variation of the smallest standard deviation $\\sigma(m-M)$, which was  obtained for the cluster's distance modulus as a function of\nthe reddening in Fig.~\\ref{ebv}. This\\ shows that an~error of 0.01 mag\nfor $E$({\\hbox{$B\\!-\\!V$}}) is acceptable and we adopted $E$({\\hbox{$B\\!-\\!V$}})$=0${$^{\\rm m}\\!\\!.$}$06\\pm0.01$ for\nthe cluster. This value of the reddening corresponds to an apparent distance\nmodulus $(m-M)_v=7${$^{\\rm m}\\!\\!.$}$98\\pm0.13$. Adopting the visual extinction\n$A_v=3.1E({\\hbox{$B\\!-\\!V$}})$, we obtain $A_v = 0.19$ mag and the distance of {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster } of $362\\pm22$ pc, lower\nthan that found by \\citet{khar2013}.\nIn addition, we estimate a~reddening of about 0\\m04 in ({\\hbox{$U\\!-\\!B$}}) from the CCD,\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{HR}. In Fig.~\\ref{HR}\nthe photometric {\\hbox{$U\\!B{}V$}} data were taken from \\citet{eggen68} and \\citet{bron63}\nand the stars in the vicinity of the {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster } are shown, as well as the most\nprobable cluster members and the primary and\nsecondary components of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n \\centering\n \\caption[]{\\label{mem} Most probable members of the $\\delta$~Lyr cluster.}\n\\begin{tabular}{lccccc}\n \\hline\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\nWEBDA No & TYC No & $P_{kin}$ & $P_{ph}$ & $P_{sp}$ \\\\\n \\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n11 & 2650 1250 & 0.82 & 0.56 & 1.00 \\\\\n528 & 2650 1237 & 0.69 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\\\\n529 & 2650 2146 & 0.93 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\\\\n533 & 2651 1056 & 0.98 & 0.81 & 1.00\\\\\n542\\tablefootmark{*} & 2651 802 & 0.67 & 0.91 & 1.00 \\\\\n545 & 2651 882 & 0.94 & 0.73 & 1.00 \\\\\n96 & 2651 772 & 0.76 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\\\\n552 & 2651 189 & 0.99 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\\\\n\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\\tablefoottext{*}{{BD+36$^\\circ$3317}.}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\addtolength{\\tabcolsep}{-2.5pt}\n \\caption[]{\\label{memrv} RV measurements of stars in {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster}.}\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n \\hline\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n  Name &\n  RV &\n  References &\n  Notes \\\\\n \\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n$HD 174959$&$-12.4\\pm2.4$&1&--\\\\\n$HD 175081$&$-26.0\\pm7.4$&2&--\\\\\n$\\delta_1$ Lyr&$-17.2\\pm4.3$&1&spectroscopic binary\\\\\n$\\delta_2$ Lyr&$-25.5\\pm0.5$&1&pulsating star\\\\\n{BD+36$^\\circ$3317 }&$-17.8\\pm0.5$&this study&EB\\\\\n \\noalign{\\smallskip}\\hline\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\tablebib{(1) \\citet{gont2006}; (2) \\citet{khar2007}.\n}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\citet{khar2005} give the cluster radius as 0.87 degrees and\nRV$= -21.6$~{km~s$^{-1}$ } \\citep[compared with -27.5 {km~s$^{-1}$ } in][]{khar2013}. Only four stars have the RV measurements in the {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster } field. These stars and the RV measurements are given in Table~\\ref{memrv}.\nLow membership probabilities are given for $\\delta_2$~Lyr and HD~174959\nin \\citep{khar2013}. However the probabilities of the membership\nfor $\\delta_1$~Lyr and HD~175081 are higher. The systemic RV of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } from our solution agrees with $\\delta_1$~Lyr, but not\nwith HD~175081. Nevertheless, the locations of the components of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } in\nboth CCD and CMD (see Fig.~\\ref{HR}), are in good agreement with the other\nhighly probable members of the cluster. Also, \\citet{khar2004,khar2013}\nclassify the system as a highly probable member. The adopted distance,\nwhich is the luminosity-weighted average of the distances obtained for the components\nfrom Table~\\ref{pyhs}, is $330\\pm29$ pc, consistent with the cluster's distance ($362\\pm22$ pc)\nwithin the quoted errors. So, we conclude that {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } is one of the most\nprobable members of the {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster}, although obtaining more\nobservations, in particular RVs, for more cluster member candidates is\nstill  very desirable.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics[scale=0.45,angle=270]{ebv.eps}}\n      \\caption{Iterative determination of the optimal $E(B-V)$ -- see\n text for details.}\n         \\label{ebv}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n  \\hspace{-1 cm}\n  {\\includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=270]{CCD.eps}}\n   \\hspace{-3 cm}\n   {\\includegraphics[scale=0.6,angle=270]{CMD.eps}}\\\\\n    \\hspace{-2.8 cm}\n   \\end{tabular}\n      \\caption{ CCD (left panel) and CMD (right panel) diagrams for {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster}.\nThe solid lines represent the theoretical ZAMS shifted in both axes\nby appropriate amounts (see the text).The triangle and square symbols\ndenote the primary and secondary component, respectively.

So we tried to obtain best isochrone fitting for the cluster by using only the most probable members given in Table~\\ref{mem}.\nTo do so, we considered both the turn-off point and the slope of\nthe main sequence together. We compared our CMD with the YZVAR Padova\nIsochrones produced by \\citet{ber2009}. We obtained the best fit\nfor the isochrone of $(y,z) = (0.3, 0.017)$ for the cluster.\nFinally, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{iso}, the age of the cluster is\nbetween $\\log t = 7.4$ and 7.5. So we accepted an~age of about\n$3\\times10^7$ yrs for the cluster. This value is also in  good accordance with the evolutionary status of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317}, as  pointed out in Sec. 3.7.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n    \\hspace*{-1.5cm}\n    {\\includegraphics[scale=0.65,angle=270]{iso.eps}}\n      \\caption{ HR diagram of {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster}.

The results can be summarised as follows.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The masses, radii, effective temperatures, and absolute luminosities\nsummarised in Table~\\ref{pyhs} show that both components of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } are\nlittle evolved from the ZAMS and compatible with the published\nevolutionary models of \\citet{ber2009}.\n\\item The spin-orbit synchronisation for our solution would predict\nthe projected rotational velocities of 20.7 and 17.2~{km~s$^{-1}$ } for the\nprimary and secondary, respectively. This does not\ncontradict the values we estimated from the line profiles, taking\ntheir associated errors into consideration.\n\\item We reinforce the conclusion that {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } is a probable member of the\n{$\\delta$~Lyr cluster}. Both binary components seem to agree with the other members of {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster } on the main sequence in CMD.\n\\item Using the de-reddened magnitudes from our solution individually for\nboth components, we derived the weighted mean distance of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } of\n$330\\pm29$~pc. This distance is within the\nboundaries of the cluster distance estimated from CMD of {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster } and, if the\nmembership of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 } in the cluster can be confirmed definitively, it would\nrepresent the most accurate estimate for the distance of the {$\\delta$~Lyr cluster}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nWe thank to Dr. O. \\\"{O}zdarcan for sharing his photometric data of {BD+36$^\\circ$3317 }\nwith us, and to Dr.~\\\"O.~\\c Cak{\\i}rl{\\i} for his support concerning the program {\\tt COMPO2} for temperature searching process with the composite spectra method.\nThe visit of EK in Praha and Ond\\v{r}ejov was supported by The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T\\\"{U}B{\\.I}TAK) by the fellowship of B{\\.I}DEP-2214 International\nDoctoral Research Fellowship Programme.\nShe thanks colleagues in the Astronomical Institute of the Charles\nUniversity and Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of\nthe Czech Republic for their hospitality and help during her stay.\nResearch of PH, MW, and JN was\nsupported by grants P209/10/0715 and GA15-02112S of the Czech Science\nFoundation and the research of JN was additionally supported with\ngrant no.~250015 of Grant Agency of the Charles University in Prague.\nWe benefited from the use of the SIMBAD database and the VizieR service\noperated at CDS, Strasbourg, France and the NASA's Astrophysics Data System\nBibliographic Services and the WEBDA open cluster database.\n\\end{acknowledgements}\n\n\\bibliographystyle{aa}\n\\bibliography{evrim}\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13885, "prevtext": "\n\\smallskip\\noindent\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectra disentangling and another trial solution}\nTo check  the results from the direct RV measurements in {\\hbox{\\tt SPEFO}}, and\nto obtain line spectra of individual binary components that were suitable for further\nanalyses, we decided to disentangle the spectra.
