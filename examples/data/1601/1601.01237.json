The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is based on the kinetic theory which allows to construct physical models from microscopic as well as from macroscopic viewpoints. \n\nWhile multi-component LBM's have shown promising results on a large number of academic cases, numerical accuracy and stability still represent challenges under extreme conditions such as coarse resolution and low viscosity. Actually, it is these conditions that are likely to be encountered in many engineering applications. In this paper, issues with currently existing schemes and models are pointed out, and an improved LB scheme is tested.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \\ref{sec:fund_formalism}, the standard LBM for multi-component flow is briefly reviewed. In Sec. \\ref{sec:basic_func}, issues related to the basic functionality are specified, and an improved scheme is proposed and tested via the simulation of a two-dimensional droplet. In Sec. \\ref{sec:wboundary}, cases with wall boundaries are discussed and typical issues associated with boundary models are pointed out. A new boundary model is tested on some benchmark cases. We discuss results in Sec. \\ref{sec:summary}. In this paper, all physical quantities are written in lattice units, and the discrete lattice time and space increments are $\\Delta x = \\Delta t = 1$. \n\n\n\\section{Multi-component lattice Bolzmann method}\n\\label{sec:fund_formalism}\nThe commonly used LB equation for multi-component flow can be written as:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:basic_LBM_eq}\n f_{i}^{\\alpha} \\left( \\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\Delta t, t+\\Delta t\n \\right) - f_{i}^{\\alpha} \\left( \\boldsymbol{x} , t \\right) \n= \\mathscr{C}_{i}^{\\: \\alpha} + \\mathscr{F}_{i}^{\\alpha},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f_{i}^{\\alpha}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{c}_{i}\\Delta t,t+\\Delta t\\right%&#10;)-f_{i}^{\\alpha}\\left(\\boldsymbol{x},t\\right)=\\mathscr{C}_{i}^{\\&gt;\\alpha}+%&#10;\\mathscr{F}_{i}^{\\alpha},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>f</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc84</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>f</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\ud835\udc9e</mi><mi>i</mi><mpadded lspace=\"2.2pt\" width=\"+2.2pt\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></mpadded></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\u2131</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msubsup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01237.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nThe equilibrium state $f_{i}^{eq, \\alpha}$ with the third order expansion is defined as:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:feq}\nf_{i}^{eq, \\alpha}(\\rho^{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{u}) = \\rho^{\\alpha} w_{i} [ 1 +\n  \\frac{\\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}}{T_0}  + \\frac{\\left(\n    \\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} \\right)^2}{2T_0^2} \\nonumber \\\\ \n- \\frac{\\boldsymbol{u}^2}{2T_0}  \n+ \\frac{\\left( \\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} \\right)^3}{6T_0^3} -\n  \\frac{\\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}}{2T_0^2}\\boldsymbol{u}^2 ]. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $T_0=1/3$ is the lattice temperature, $w_i$ is the isotropic weight in D3Q19, $\\rho^{\\alpha}$ is the density of the component $\\alpha$, and $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is the mixture flow velocity:\n\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\rho^{\\alpha} = \\sum_i f_i^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\rho = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\rho^{\\alpha} = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\sum_i f_i^{\\alpha} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{u} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\alpha} \\sum_i \\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\cdot f_i^{\\alpha}}{\\rho}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThere exist several models that introduce local interactions between components that are responsible for separation between the components \\cite{1993_Xiaowen,1994_Xiaowen}.

Moreover, most usage cases for multi-component  flow require accurate treatment of solid wall properties such as no-slip and wettability. \n\nIn the standard LBM, the no-slip condition is realized with pointwise particles' bounce back model \\cite{1998_Chen_Rev}. In cases with coarse resolution or low viscosity, accuracy may deteriorate. When the geometry or the local shear velocity is under-resolved, the shear stress along the wall cannot be estimated accurately. Numerical smearing could also easily contaminate flow field in the near wall region when the physical viscosity is low. As a result, the numerically simulated absolute permeability in the porous media may have significant viscosity dependence even if the Reynolds number is low enough to satisfy the Darcy's law approximately \\cite{2014_Haihu}. In the previous studies \\cite{2006_Pan,2015_Fattahia}, the multiple relaxation time (MRT) scheme along with the interpolated and multi-reflected boundary conditions improved this issue. However those schemes are difficult to generalize and implement for complex problems. Both of these types of boundary conditions do not conserve the local mass and require complicated local numerical interpolations in the near wall regions. Thus a more robust, accurate, and simple model is desired.\n\nThe wettability condition is often modeled by an interaction force between the fluid and the wall. A wall potential $\\rho_s^{\\alpha}$ is assigned to each wall to enable interactions between the solid surface and fluid particles using a point-wise concept along the lines of Eq. (\\ref{eq:comp_interaction}). The correspondence between $\\rho_s^{\\alpha}$ and the contact angle can be  defined by simulating some test cases, after which it can be used for general cases. Although this wettability model works well for certain cases \\cite{2015_Otomo}, it could sometimes generate an artificial thin film along a wetting wall. \nThis film originates from slugs or droplets on the wall, and this numerical artifact is obviously undesirable because large amounts of mass may artificially diffuse and escape from the inlet or outlet boundary. Another well known undesirable issue is the artificial movement of  static droplets on inclined walls. Because of insufficient isotropy of discrete numerical schemes, even if the droplet is not subject by any driving force, the droplet may easily descend or even climb the slope. To address these issues, the improved wall boundary conditions are developed and validated.   \n\n\n\\subsection{Modified wall models}\n\nIn our work, the bounce back model is an extension of the volumetric boundary condition proposed by Chen et al in 1998 \\cite{1998_Chen,2009_Leo,2004_Yanbing,2006_Fan}, which has been extensively studied for arbitrary geometry. The main features of this model are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Boundary surfaces are discretized into piece-wise linear surface facets in two dimensions and triangular polygons in three dimensions;\n\\item During the fluid dynamics calculation, the facets/polygons gather incoming particles from neighboring cells in a volumetric way;\n\\item At the wall, the direction of the incoming particle is flipped and the outgoing particle is constructed;\n\\item The outgoing particles are scattered back to neighbor cells in the similar volumetric way.\n\\end{enumerate} \nMore details can be found in \\cite{1998_Chen}, in particular a proof that conservation laws are obeyed locally as well as globally.\n\nIn addition to the correction of surface scattering described in \\cite{2009_Leo}, a hybrid solid wall boundary condition for the no slip wall is proposed here in order to further reduce numerical smearing for coarse resolution simulations. The distribution function of outgoing particles $f_{i}^{out,  \\alpha}$ is a combination of bounced back particles and the Maxwellian equilibrium particle distribution in accordance to viscosity values.\n\nIn our wettability model, the interaction force $\\boldsymbol{F}_{w}^{\\alpha,  \\beta}$ is extended from the inter-component force form given by\nEq. (\\ref{eq:comp_interaction}) using the volumetric boundary scheme as,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \n\\label{eq:wall_interaction}\n\\boldsymbol{F}_{w}^{\\alpha, \\beta} \\left( \\boldsymbol{x} \\right) = G \\rho_{\\alpha} \\left( \\boldsymbol{x} \\right) \\sum_{i} w_{i} \\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\rho^{'}_{\\beta} \\left(  \\boldsymbol{x}+ \\boldsymbol{c}_{i} \\Delta t \\right) ,  \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\rho^{'}_{\\beta}$ is constructured in a volumetric way so that $\\partial\n\\rho_{\\beta} / \\partial n = 0$ \\cite{1998_Chen}. It is worth pointing out that such a volumetric wettability scheme has sufficient isotropy in complex geometry.\n\n\\subsection{Results}\n\nThe modified models are validated in order to establish that the issues specified above are improved. First, the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ dependence of the absolute permeability is investigated by simulating the simple cubic (SC) array of spheres. Second, the thin film along the wall is tested on the case of a static slug between plates. Third, the artificial movement of a droplet on an inclined wall is studied.\n\n\\subsubsection{The SC array of spheres}\n\nThe single-component gravity driven flow through the SC array of spheres is simulated. The simulation domain is set as a cube with the edge length $L=34$, containing a sphere in the center. Periodic boundaries are assigned to each pair of faced cube surfaces. The relative volume fraction $\\chi=(c/c_{max})^{1/3}= 1$ and the spheres are touching each other, where $c$ is the ratio of the solid volume to the cube volume and $c_{max}$ is its maximum value, $\\pi/6$ in the SC array. The choices of $\\tau$ are $\\left\\{ 0.505, 0.51, 0.55, 0.6, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5 \\right\\}$. \nThe gravity $g$ is in the perpendicular direction to a cube surface and $g=1.e-4$ when $\\nu=0.1666$.\nThe value of $g$ for the other values of $\\nu$ is adjusted so that $g/ \\nu^2$ is kept constant. \nSuch a choice keeps the Reynolds number constant for the case of the Hagen-Poiseuille flow when the channel height is fixed. Under the low Reynolds number assumption, the Darcy's law is obeyed and the flow is within the Stokes flow regime. Therefore for a given geometry, the absolute permeability $K$ should be a constant independent of physical properties as long as the flow Reynolds number is small. In our simulations, the absolute permeability is evaluated as $K = \\phi \\nu U /g$, where $\\phi$ is the porosity and $U$ is the spatial averaged velocity.\n\nA streamline in the case of $\\tau=1$ is presented on the left side of Fig. \\ref{fig:packed_sphere_SC}. The color represents the velocity magnitude ranging from 0 to 0.0025. Around the region where the spheres are touching, the flow path is of a narrow concave shape and therefore the flow is fast. In such a region, the resolution tends to be relatively coarse and numerical smearing could be quite pronounced when fluid viscosity is low.\n\nOn the right side of Fig. \\ref{fig:packed_sphere_SC}, the simulated absolute permeability with the original bounce back and the currently presented models are shown, along  with the analytical solution obtained through the analytical dimensionless drag force from \\cite{1982_Sangani,2006_Pan,2015_Fattahia}. In all simulations the Reynolds number $U L/ \\nu$ is less than 0.4. The absolute permeability simulated using the original model shows a measurable dependence upon viscosity, consistent with previous studies by other researchers \\cite{2014_Haihu}. On the other hand, the modified model reported in this work significantly reduces this dependence even at very low viscosities. Simulation results agree well with the analytical solution. Thus the new models can be applied for the complex geometry including sharp convex and concave shapes, while maintaining high accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{c}\n      \n      \\begin{minipage}{0.5\\hsize}\n        \\begin{center}\n          \\includegraphics[clip, width=7.5 cm]{./overview_packedsphere_SC.eps}\n        \\end{center}\n      \\end{minipage}\n      \n      \\begin{minipage}{0.5\\hsize}\n        \\begin{center}\n          \\includegraphics[clip, width=7.5 cm]{./Absolute_permeability_SC.eps}\n        \\end{center}\n      \\end{minipage}\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Geometry and flow stream lines colored by velocity magnitude ranging from 0 to 0.0025(left), and the absolute permeability as a function of the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ with the present and original model(right).

The channel height is set at 32 and $\\tau$ for both components is 1. The second component is mainly located in the middle section of the channel. The wall potential $\\rho^{\\alpha}_{s}$ is set as $\\rho^{1}_{s}=0$, $\\rho^{2}_{s}=0.088$ so that the contact angle is roughly 40 degrees. In Fig. \\ref{fig:dens_slug_between_plates}, the color contours show the second component density distribution with the original and modified wettability models, respectively. It is seen that the modified scheme reduces the thin \nfilm artifact significantly without changing the contact angle. \n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:contact_thin_film}, the contact angle and the thin film density are shown as a function of wall potential. The wall potentials $\\rho_s^1$ and $\\rho_s^2$ are varied as $\\rho_s^1 = - \\rho_0 \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot \\Theta \\left( - \\alpha \\right)$ and  $\\rho_s^2 = \\rho_0 \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot \\Theta \\left( \\alpha \\right)$. The parameter $\\alpha$ is actually a dimensionless wall potential, $\\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function, and $\\rho_0 = 0.22$. The contact angle was measured by fitting a circle to the interface. Thin film density is detected in the first lattice cell of the simulation domain's edge. Observe from Fig. \\ref{fig:contact_thin_film} that the our modification of the wall models does not change the contact angle, as intended, but at the same time reduces the thin film and wettability dependence of the thin film for all cases.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{c}\n      \n      \\begin{minipage}{0.5\\hsize}\n        \\begin{center}\n          \\includegraphics[clip, width=7.5 cm]{./slug_between_plates_BGK_dens.eps}\n        \\end{center}\n      \\end{minipage}\n      \n      \\begin{minipage}{0.5\\hsize}\n        \\begin{center}\n          \\includegraphics[clip, width=7.5 cm]{./slug_between_plates_latest_dens.eps}\n        \\end{center}\n      \\end{minipage}\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Density of the second component, $\\rho_2$, with the original (left) and modified wettability model (right).

The droplet is composed by the second component, surrounded by the first component. The channel height is 16 and the wall potential is set similarly to the slug case above. The periodic boundaries are enforced on the top/left and bottom/right edges. The inclination angles are $\\left\\{ 10, 30, 50, 70 \\right\\}$ degrees. In the cases with the same inclination angle, exactly the same initial droplet mass is set. In Fig. \\ref{fig:inclined_ang10} and Fig. \\ref{fig:inclined_ang30}, the results obtained with the original and modified models are compared using the inclination angles of 10 and 30 degrees, for $\\tau_1=0.55$ and $\\tau_2=1.5$. Fig. \\ref{fig:inclined_ang10} shows that the droplet is less diffusive with the modified models, which is likely due to the reduction of the thin film effect that has been shown for the previously discussed cases. In Fig. \\ref{fig:inclined_ang30} the droplet simulated with the modified model is static, as desired, while the one with the original model is moving. In Table \\ref{tab:inclined_wall}, results for various $\\tau$ combinations and inclination angles are presented. The droplet velocity is calculated by measuring the position change of the droplet center mass between 8.e+4 and 8.5e+4 time steps. Therefore the velocity less than 2.e-4 cannot be measured accurately and is set to 0. Utilizing the ratio of the droplet volume to total volume, the mass diffusion can be evaluated and the quantitative comparison between the two models is presented. The droplet volume is detected by adding volume where the second component density is more than 0.18. The results show that the modified model improves the artificial droplet movement and mass diffusion on the inclined wall for all tested inclinations.\n\n \n\n\\begin{figure*}[htbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{c}\n      \n      \\begin{minipage}{0.5\\hsize}\n        \\begin{center}\n          \\includegraphics[clip, width=7.5 cm]{./Inclined_NuT1_005_NuT2_1_ang10_BGK.eps}\n        \\end{center}\n      \\end{minipage}\n      \n      \\begin{minipage}{0.5\\hsize}\n        \\begin{center}\n          \\includegraphics[clip, width=7.5 cm]{./Inclined_NuT1_005_NuT2_1_ang10_latest.eps}\n        \\end{center}\n      \\end{minipage}\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{The density of the second component at different timesteps with the original (left) and modified (right) models.

The algorithm and numerical scheme are generalized for practical applications. The surface tension achieved in the simulation is independent of fluid viscosity and resolution. The spurious current is significantly reduced. The new surface wetting scheme for complex geometry improves the near wall algorithm isotropy and the overall quality of numerical solution in the near wall region, in particular it reduces the unphysical surface thin film and mass diffusion. The model enables simulation of multi-component flows in an extended viscosity range and in complex geometry with much improved accuracy, stability, and robustness. \n\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{40}\n\n\\bibitem{1993_Xiaowen} X.

The general idea and relevant algorithm details of the regularization can be found in \\cite{2006_Chen, 2006_Zhang, 2006_Latt, 2006_Xiaowen_JFM,2008_Chen}. Here we would like to emphasize that this filter collision operator keeps the nonequilibrium information of moments up to the desired order, for example the 2nd   order for the momentum flux and the 3rd   order for the energy flux, and removes other higher order nonequilibrium moments in the Hermite space. Such a filtering procedure could substantially reduce unphysical noise and numerical artifacts and improve numerical stability and accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nAs a first test of this approach, a two-dimensional static droplet is simulated with the variable initial droplet radius, $R= \\left\\{ 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48 \\right\\}$, and relaxation time, $\\tau^{\\alpha} = \\left\\{ 0.525, 0.55, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0 \\right\\}$ for each component. The simulation domain size is five times the droplet radius and the initial density for each component is 0.22. After a steady state is reached, the droplet radius is measured by fitting the hyperbolic tangent curve to the density profile.\n\nIn Fig.\\ref{fig:dP_vs_1R_latest_BGK}, the pressure differences across the droplet interface, $dP$, are plotted with respect to the inverse droplet radius $1/R$, using four sets of $\\tau^{\\alpha}$ combinations with the maximum viscosity ratio of 100. The subscripts 1 and 2 for $\\tau$ denote quantities inside and outside the droplet, respectively. Results for all $\\tau$ options are fitted by a line.
