Recently,  collective excitations of low-dimensional electron gases, \ncalled sheet plasmons, came into focus of research \\cite{Nagao10,Vattuone13}. \nThe wavelength of these sheet plasmons is typically three orders of magnitude  shorter \ncompared to photons of the same frequency.  Thus THz-plasmonics on the scale of a few nanometers becomes feasible. \n\nOne-dimensional (1D) metallic wires and their plasmonic excitations would be ideal for directed energy transport\non the nanoscale, since quasi-linear dispersion is predicted, at least in the long wavelength limit \\cite{Sarma85}, \nfor these 1D plasmons. Such dispersions have indeed been found for regular arrays of atomic wires on insulating \nsubstrates \\cite{Nagao07,Rugeramigabo10,Krieg13}. \nUnder certain conditions of coupling and mutual screening  \nlinearized plasmon dispersions, so-called acoustic surface plasmons, are obtained in 2D systems \\cite{Diaconescu07, Vattuone13}. \nMoreover, confinement effects in these metallic subunits on the surface lead to formation of intersubband \nexcitations \\cite{Rugeramigabo10,Krieg13,Smerieri14}. On the other hand, several fundamental aspects of these low-D plasmons \nsuch as many-body effects, electronic correlations and Coulomb screening \\cite{Lindhard54,Stern67,Singwi68} \nare still rather unexplored and lead to an unsatisfactory description of experimental results \n\\cite{Inaoka07,Nagao07,Rugeramigabo10}.\n\nGrowth of various metals in the submonolayer regime on semiconducting surfaces  provide a superb approach \nfor addressing such fundamental aspects for 1D and 2D systems. The adsorbate induced band structure is generally electronically \ndecoupled from the bulk bands of the host material. Au chains on regularly stepped Si(111) surfaces \nat various tilt angles towards the {$\\rm [\\bar{1} \\bar{1} 2]\\,$} direction are no exception and are particularly interesting systems because of intrinsic surface magnetism \n\\cite{Erwin10, Aulbach13}. \nDepending on coverage and vicinality, the widths of the Au-chains and their interwire \nspacing can be tuned, while their electronic band structures are still very similar. \n0.2\\,ML of Au on Si(557), e.g., result in growth of single atom Au-chains and a row of Si-adatoms \non each mini-terrace with an interwire spacing of 19.2\\,\\AA\\ \\cite{Crain04,Nagao06}. In contrast, Si(553) and Si(775)-Au \nhost double Au chains in the center of the terrace \\cite{Aulbach15,Krawiec10}. \nThe interwire spacing is 14.8\\,\\AA\\ for Si(553)  and 21.3\\,\\AA\\ for Si(775) \\cite{Crain04,Barke09,Erwin10}. For double Au chains, \nnominal coverages of 0.48\\,ML on Si(553) and of 0.32\\,ML on Si(775) result.  \nCommon to all these structures is a graphitic Si-honeycomb chain located at the step edges \\cite{Crain04,Barke09,Erwin10}.\n\n\n\nEach of these system is characterized by metallic bands that are well known from angular resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements \\cite{Crain04}. \nThey only disperse along \nthe chain direction $k_\\parallel$, and have their minima at the zone boundary. Thus, also the (equilibrium) electron density available for plasmonic excitations is well known.\n\nIn fact, these systems form locally the narrowest possible 1D objects that can be realized, namely chains that are \none or two atoms wide. Therefore, we address here the question of local confinement both for the ground state\nclose to the Fermi level and for the collective excited plasmon state with emphasis on the plasmons. \nWe compare the collective excitations in Si(553)-Au and Si(775)-Au, since the same structural motif of the \ndouble gold chain is present in both systems, and make reference to the Si(557)-Au system with only a single gold chain. \nAlthough purely 1D dispersion along the chain direction is found, the lateral extension of the \ncharge distribution turns out to explicitly influence the slope of the measured plasmon dispersion curves. \nIn other words, this crossover into the second dimension is crucial for the quantitative interpretation of a 1D phenomenon, but\nis not described by existing theories. \nIn contrast, the plasmonic coupling between the wires in the ordered arrays, which is another aspect of dimensional crossover, \ncan be described  quantitatively by existing mesoscopic theories \\cite{Li90,DasSarma96}. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nAll experiments were performed in two different ultra-high vacuum chambers operating at a base pressure of $5 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{mbar}$. \nOne system hosts a high resolution spot profile analysis low energy electron diffractometer \n(SPA-LEED) to investigate and control the sample quality, and a combination of an electron energy loss \nspectrometer with a LEED diffractometer providing high resolution both in energy and momentum \\cite{Claus92} in order to determine\nplasmon dispersion relations. The overall sample quality was checked by a SPA-LEED.\nThe vicinal Si-substrates ($\\rho \\approx 0.01\\,\\Omega\\text{cm}$, n-type) were annealed at \n$1250\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ for a few seconds \nfollowed by rapid cool down. \nThe appropriate coverages of 0.48\\,ML for Si(553)-Au and 0.32\\,ML for Si(775)-Au were evaporated from a gold pearl on a tungsten \nfilament by direct current heating, or from a crucible at a substrate temperature of $630\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ . \nThe coverage has been controlled and calibrated by quartz microbalances placed at the position of the samples \n\\cite{Sauerbrey59}. After Au-deposition and cooling room temperature the samples were quickly annealed to \n$930\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ for $< 1$\\,s,  followed by instantaneous cooling to room temperature.\nThe loss measurements were carried out directly after this post-annealing step in order to avoid \nany influence of residual gas on surface and electronic structure. \nThe scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements were performed at 77\\,K in the second chamber using a low temperature STM manufactured \nby Omicron. The overall sample quality here was checked with an optical LEED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\columnwidth]{Fig1_alternative1.png}\n\t\t\\caption{\\label{FIG1}\n\t\t(color online) a) LEED patterns of the chain structures of Si(553)-Au and Si(775)-Au. \n\t\tb) STM image of the Si(775)-Au \n\t\tchain structure\t(tunneling conditions U= -1.25 V, I = 300 pA): $\\upalpha, \\upbeta, \\upgamma$ mark the Si terrace \n\t\tedge, a row of Si adatoms accompanied by Si restatoms, and a Au double chain with $\\times 2$ period doubling, respectively \\cite{Aulbach15}.\n\t\tSTM experiments were performed at 77\\,K, LEED at 300 K.

The LEED patterns right after preparation are shown in fig.\\,\\ref{FIG1}a). \nThese patterns are characteristic for regularly stepped (553) and (775) surfaces. They consist of (111)-oriented \nterraces and steps of double atomic height ($d=3.14$\\,\\AA). From the spot splitting of 22\\,\\% SBZ (surface Brillouin zone) \nfor Si(553)-Au and 15.6\\,\\% SBZ for Si(775) we derive average terrace widths of $14.8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ \nfor the Si(553) and of $21.3\\,\\text{\\AA}$ for the Si(775) surface. Thus, the adsorption of 0.48\\,ML of Au on Si(553) -- \n0.32\\,ML on Si(775) -- leaves the periodic array of double steps with sharp spots and $\\times 2$ streaks unchanged, \nindicating high quality 1D order. This is in agreement with STM, exemplarily shown for the (775)-system in (fig.\\,\\ref{FIG1}c)).\nA narrow distribution of terrace widths can be concluded from $(k_{||},k_{\\perp})$-plots in LEED (not shown) and from STM.\n\nHigh resolution STM, shown in fig.\\,\\ref{FIG1}b) for the Si(775)-Au system, reveals details of the atomic arrangement (for an extended set \nof STM data on Si(553)-Au, see ref.\\,\\cite{Aulbach13}). \nEach terrace hosts three structural motifs. Their origin could be disentangled by a detailed analysis via STM and density functional \ntheory, which will be published elsewhere \\cite{Aulbach15}. However, we will list our results here: \nThe motif denoted by $\\alpha$ could be ascribed to the Si honeycomb chain at the\nstep edge. Chain $\\beta$ is formed by a Si adatom row accompanied by Si restatoms (i.e. unpassivated Si atoms).  \nMotif $\\gamma$, most important for this work, could be identified as a double Au-strand \\cite{Aulbach15}, \nsimilar to what was found in Si(553)-Au \\cite{Erwin10,Aulbach13,Krawiec10}.\n\nMost importantly, the chain structures show a $2a=7.7\\,\\text{\\AA}$ \nperiodicity along the wire direction. Correspondingly, LEED reveals modulated $\\times 2$\ndiffraction streaks. The streaks along the {$\\rm [\\bar{1} \\bar{1} 2]\\,$} direction are indicative for  only \nshort-range  correlation between the double periodicity along the chains on the different terraces.\nFor Si(553)-Au, only the Au chains show the $\\times 2$ periodicity. \nTherefore, the modulation and intensity of the $\\times 2$ diffractions streaks there are weaker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\t\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=.9\\columnwidth]{Fig2a.png}\n\t\t\\caption{\\label{FIG2}\n\t\t(color online) Electron energy loss spectra (primary energy 20\\,eV) of Au-chains grown on Si(553) \n\t\tas a function of $k$ parallel and normal to the wires, as indicated.}\n\t\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nOn these well ordered arrays of 1D atomic chains, angle resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements \nwere performed.

We also use their surface band notation.\nThe systems investigated here are characterized by two \nsurface bands, an upper $S_1$ and lower $S_2$, crossing the Fermi level \\cite{Crain04,Barke09}. As we see a metallic behavior of the Si(775)-Au\nsystem, we assume its bands also to cross the Fermi level for a clean sample at room temperature.\nThe ratio $n/m^\\star$ for both bands is identical within error bars. This means that the plasmons of these bands are degenerate and\ncannot be separated experimentally. As a consequence, only a single dispersion curve is expected to be seen for both systems \nwith the electron density corresponding to a single band, in agreement with our findings. \n\nThe fits are shown in fig.\\,\\ref{FIG3} together with the data. \nAn explicit dependence of initial slope and shape of dispersion on structural motifs and on terrace widths is found, \nwhich is not described by existing 1D theories, as we will now demonstrate by concentrating on the first term in eq.\\,\\ref{eq2}. \n\nComparing first Si(553)-Au and Si(775)-Au, which both have the Au double chain, but have different terrace widths,\nthis first term of eq.\\,\\ref{eq2} differs by a factor of 1.4 (after correction for small differences of DOS), \nas indicated by the dashed-dotted lines in fig.\\ref{FIG3}, i.e., it scales with the inverse of the \nterrace width, $d$ ($21.3\\,\\text{\\AA} / 14.8\\,\\text{\\AA} = 1.43$).\n\nSi(775)-Au and  Si(557)-Au \\cite{Nagao06}, on the other hand, have the same terrace widths (within 10\\,\\%, 19.2 vs. 21.3\\,\\AA), \nbut double and single Au chains per terrace, respectively.

However, fitting the published data of ref.\\,\\cite{Nagao06} for Si(557)-Au to eq.\\,\\ref{eq2}, \nit turns out that its first term is a factor of 1.6 {\\it larger} for Si(557)-Au than that of Si(775)-Au. \nTaking the differences in $n$ and the $d$-dependence from above for the two systems, the effective width $a$, as suggested  in eq.\\,\\ref{eq2}, \nhas to be reduced effectively by roughly a factor of 2 for Si(557)-Au compared to Si(775)-Au. \nIn other words, not only the periodicity, given by the wire distances $d$, is influencing the dispersion directly, \nbut also the {\\em internal 2D distribution} of electron density within each wire plays an important role in the plasmon dispersion. \nSince for these narrow structures and the given k$_F$ from ARPES only the lowest subband of a quantum well is occupied, combined excitations\nsuch as intersubband plasmon excitations can be ruled out.\n\nThese findings can be summarized by\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "$$\\omega_p \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{n\\cdot a_0^2}{m^\\star\\cdot a^2}}$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\omega_{p}\\propto\\sqrt{\\frac{n\\cdot a_{0}^{2}}{m^{\\star}\\cdot a^{2}}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>\u221d</mo><msqrt><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><msubsup><mi>a</mi><mn>0</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mrow><msup><mi>m</mi><mo>\u22c6</mo></msup><mo>\u22c5</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></msqrt></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
