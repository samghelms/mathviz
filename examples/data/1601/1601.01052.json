The coupling\nstrength is fixed at $\\varepsilon=1$. The initial network consists of\n$m_0=8$ globally coupled nodes, which is synchronizable for the given\ncoupling strength. For a fixed time interval $T_g=300$, we introduce\na new node (map) into the network with a randomly chosen initial condition\nin the interval $(0,1)$ by attaching it to the existing nodes according\nto the preferential attachment rule. The synchronization error is defined\nas $\\delta r_i=|x_i-\\left<x\\right>|$ with $\\left<x\\right>=\\sum_i x_i/n$\nbeing the network-averaged state, which is calculated at the end of each\ntime interval $T_g$. We set the tolerance threshold to be\n$\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$ (somewhat arbitrarily). The growing process\nis terminated either if the network has completely collapsed\n($n\\approx 0$) or when its size reaches a preset upper bound (e.g, 1000).\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:growth} shows the network size $n$\nversus the time step $n_g$. We see that, after an initial\nperiod of linear growth ($n_g \\le 123$), the network size is suddenly\ndecreased from $n=128$ to $103$, signifying that a collapse event of size\n$\\Delta n=25$ has occurred after the addition of the $124$th oscillator.\nAfter the collapse, the network begins to expand again. In the subsequent\ntime evolution, collapse of different sizes occurs at random times, e.g.,\n$\\Delta n=22$ at $n_g=379$ and $\\Delta n=10$ at $n_g=418$. For relatively\nsmall network size, when a collapse event occurs, the removed nodes\naccount for only a small fraction of the nodes in the entire network\n(e.g., $\\Delta n/n < 10\\%$), with growth followed immediately after\nthe collapse. However, as the network size exceeds a critical value,\nsay $n_{max}=400$, this scenario of small-scale collapse followed by\ngrowth is changed dramatically. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(a),\nfor $n_g=471$, a catastrophic collapse event occurs, which removes over\n$75\\%$ of the nodes in the network (from $471$ to $111$). More strikingly,\nthere is no growth after the event - the network continues to collapse.\nAt the end of $n_g = 472$, not a single node remains in the network,\ni.e., the network has collapsed {\\em completely}.\n\nTo gain more insights into the dynamics of network collapse, we monitor\nthe system evolution for the time period $123T_g<t<124T_g$, i.e., the\nresponse of the network dynamics to the addition of the $124$th node.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:growth}(b) shows the time evolution of the averaged\nnetwork synchronization error,\n$\\left<\\delta r\\right>=\\sum_i \\delta r_i/n$, where its value approaches\nzero rapid with time. A semi-logarithmic plot reveals an exponentially\ndecreasing behavior for $\\left<\\delta r\\right>$ [inset of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(b)], indicating that the network is able to restore\nsynchronization for relatively large values of $T_g$. However, for $T_g=300$,\nat the end of the time interval $t=124T_g$, the synchronization errors of\ncertain nodes exceed the threshold, leading to their removal from\nthe network. The synchronization errors for three typical nodes are\nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(c). Examining the individual nodal\nsynchronization errors $\\delta r_i$, we find that, the ``disturbance''\ntriggered by the addition of a new node spreads quickly over the network,\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(d). After the disturbance reaches the\nmaximal dynamical range at $t\\approx 123T_g+5$ [Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(e)], it\nbegins to shrink and, at the end of this time interval, there are still a\nfew nodes with $\\delta r>\\delta r_c$, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(f).\nBased on their dynamical responses, the nodes can be roughly\ndivided into three categories, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(c).\nSpecifically, for most nodes, as time increases $\\delta r$ first increases\nand then decreases, e.g., the $126$th node. There are also nodes for which\nthe values of $\\delta r$ decrease monotonically with time, e.g., the $125$th\nnode. Finally, there are a few nodes for which the values of $\\delta r$\nremain about $0$, e.g., the $129$th node. We also observe that, sometimes,\nthe new node, whose introduction into the network triggers a network collapse,\nin fact remains in the network.\n\n\\section{Statistical properties of collapse and self-organized\ncriticality} \\label{sec:statistics}\n\nIn terms of practical significance, the following questions about network\ncollapse are of interest: (1) what kind of nodes are more likely to be\nremoved? (2) what is the size distribution of the collapse? (3) how\nfrequent is the network collapsed? and (4) what are the effects of\nthe tolerance threshold $\\delta r_c$ and growing interval $T_g$ on the\ncollapse? In this section we address these questions numerically.\n\nA simple way to identify the removed nodes is to examine their degrees.\nWith the same parameters as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}, we plot in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:statistics}(a) the normalized degree distribution, $p_{del}(k)$,\nof the removed nodes collected from a large number of collapse events\n(except the catastrophic one that totally destroys the network). We see\nthat the distribution contains approximately three distinct segments with\ndifferent scaling behaviors. Specifically, for $k\\in[1,m]$, $p_{del}(k)$\nincreases with $k$ exponentially. For $k\\in[m,40]$, $p_{del}(k)$ decreases\nwith $k$ algebraically with the exponent $\\gamma\\approx -2.83$. For\n$k\\in[40, 120]$, $p_{del}(k)$ decreases with $k$ exponentially. Since,\nin our model each new node has $m=8$ links, it is somewhat surprising to\nsee from Fig.~\\ref{fig:statistics}(a) that some nodes have their degrees\nsmaller than $m$. This phenomenon can be attributed to the node removal\nmechanism: when a node is removed, all links associated to it are also\nremoved. Another phenomenon is that $p_{del}(k)$ reaches its maximum\nat $k=8$, which seems to contradict the previous result that nodes of\nlarge degrees are more stable with respect to synchronization than those of\nsmall degrees~\\cite{MZK:2005,ZK:2006,WLL:2007,PC:2015}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{Graph2.eps}\n\\caption{(Color online) Statistical properties of collapse and SOC.\n(a) Degree distribution $p_{del}(k)$ of the removed nodes (filled circles).\nFor $k\\in[m,40]$, the scaling behavior is $p_{del}(k)\\sim k^{\\gamma}$, with\n$\\gamma\\approx -2.83$. For $k\\le m$ and $k\\ge 40$, $p_{del}(k)$ increases\nand decreases with $k$ exponentially, respectively. Open squares are for\nthe degree distribution $p(k)$ of the generated network. (b) Size\ndistribution $p_{col}(\\Delta n)$ of the collapse event for parameters\n$T_{g}=300$ and $\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$. For $\\Delta n\\in[1,100]$,\nthe scaling is $p_{col}(\\Delta n)\\sim \\Delta n^{\\gamma}$ with\n$\\gamma\\approx -0.85$. Open squares are for the size distribution of the\ncollapse events for $T_{g}=200$ and $\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$. The algebraic\nscaling of the collapse size signifies SOC. The results are averaged over\n$100$ network realizations.}\n\\label{fig:statistics}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSince $p_{del}(k)$ is obtained from a large number of collapses, to uncover\nthe interplay between nodal stability and degree, we need to take into\naccount the degree distribution $p(k)$ of the generated network. To find\n$p(k)$, we use the largest network emerged in the growth process (the\nnetwork formed immediately before the catastrophic collapse) and obtain the\ndegree distribution for an ensemble of such networks. The results are\nalso shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:statistics}(a). We see that the two\ndistributions, $p_{del}(k)$ and $p(k)$, coincide with each other well,\nwhere $p(k)$ also contains three distinct segments and reaches its\nmaximum at $k=m$. The consistency between $p_{del}(k)$ and $p(k)$\nsuggests that the nodal stability is independent of the degree.\nStatistically, we thus expect that the small and large degree nodes\nto have equal probability to be removed.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:statistics}(b) shows the collapse size distribution,\nwhere the catastrophic network size $n_{max}$ is not included.\nWe see that, in the interval $\\Delta n\\in [1,100]$, the distribution\nfollows an algebraic scaling: $p_{col}(\\Delta n)\\sim \\Delta n^{\\gamma}$,\nwith $\\gamma\\approx -0.85$. For $\\Delta n>100$, an exponential tail is\nobserved. To test whether the exponential tail is a result of the finite\nsize effect, we decrease the transient period to $T_g=200$ and plot the\ndistribution of the collapse size again. (As we will demonstrate later,\nas $T_g$ is decreased, the maximum network size $n_{max}$ will decrease\nmonotonically.) Figure~\\ref{fig:statistics}(b) indicates that, comparing\nwith the case of $T_g=300$, the regime of algebraic scaling is shifted\ntoward the left for $T_g=200$. Specifically, for $T_g=200$, we have\n$p_{col}(\\Delta n)\\sim \\Delta n^{\\gamma}$ in the interval\n$\\Delta n\\in [1,50]$, where the fitted exponent is about $-0.79$.\n\nThe emergence of algebraic scaling in the size distribution of network\ncollapse is interesting from the viewpoint of SOC that occurs in many\nreal-world complex systems. For a dynamical system subject to continuous\nexternal perturbations, during its evolution towards SOC, it can appear\nstable for a long period of time before a catastrophic event occurs, and\nthe probability for the catastrophe can be markedly larger than\nintuitively expected (algebraic versus exponential\nscaling)~\\cite{BTW:1987,Stanley:book}. In our case, there is a long time\nperiod of synchronization stability in spite of the small-size collapses, but\ncatastrophic collapses that remove all or most of the nodes in the network\ncan occur, albeit rarely. There are a variety of models for SOC, but the\nunique feature of our model is that it exploits network synchronization\nstability as a mechanism for catastrophic failures. Since synchronization\nis ubiquitous in natural and man-made complex systems, the finding of SOC\nin synchronization-stability-constrained network may have broad implications.\nFor instance, synchronization is commonly regarded as the dynamical basis\nfor normal functioning of the power grids~\\cite{MMAN:2013}, and\nthere is empirical evidence that the size of the blackouts follows roughly\nan algebraic distribution~\\cite{PA:2013}.\n\nWe proceed to study the frequency of network collapse. Let $\\Delta n'$ be\nthe period of continuous network growth, i.e., the number of nodes\nsuccessively added into the network between two adjacent collapses.\nThe collapse frequency is $f=1/\\left<\\Delta n'\\right>$, where\n$\\left<\\Delta n'\\right>$ is the averaged period.\nFor the same parameters in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}, we find\n$f\\approx 1/21$. That is, on average the network collapses every $21$\nnew additions. Since the synchronization errors are evaluated at the\nend of each transient interval and nodes are removed according to a\npredefined tolerance threshold, we expect the collapse\nfrequency to depend on the parameters $T_g$ and $\\delta r_c$. This\nis apparent in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(a), where the network growth\nunder the parameters $T_g=300$ and $\\delta r_c= 10^{-9}$ is also\nshown. We see that, comparing with the case of $\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$,\nthe catastrophic collapse is postponed. To assess the influence of $T_g$\nand $\\delta r_c$ on $f$, we show in Fig.~\\ref{fig:frequency}(a) $f$\nversus $T_g$ for different values of $\\delta r_c$. It can be seen that,\nwith the increase of $T_g$ or $\\delta r_c$, $f$ decreases monotonically.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{Graph3.eps}\n\\caption{(Color online) Behavior of the collapse frequency.\n(a) The collapse frequency $f$ as a function of the transient interval $T_g$\nfor different values of the tolerance threshold $\\delta r_c$.

Similar to the collapse frequency, these\ntwo quantities depend on the parameters $T_g$ and $\\delta r_c$.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:frequency}(b) shows $n_1$ ($n_{max}$) versus $T_g$ for\ndifferent values of $\\delta r_c$. We see that, as $T_g$ or $\\delta r_c$\nis increased, $n_1$ ($n_{max}$) increases monotonically. That is, by\nincreasing $T_g$ or $\\delta r_c$, one can postpone the first and the\ncatastrophic network collapse but eventually it will occur.\n\n\n\\section{Physical theory of synchronization based network collapse}\n\\label{sec:theory}\n\nSay at step $n'$ of the growth, the network contains $n-1$ synchronized\noscillators and a new oscillator of random initial condition is introduced.\nDue to the new oscillator, the trajectories of the existing oscillators\nleave, at least temporarily, the synchronous manifold $\\mathbf{x}_s$.

To understand how\ncertain dynamical behaviors can or cannot persist as the underlying\nnetwork grows is a problem of increasing importance in complex dynamical\nsystems as well as sustainability science and engineering. We address the\nquestion of whether a complex network of nonlinear oscillators can maintain\nits synchronization stability as it expands or grows. A network in the real\nworld can never be completely synchronized due to noise and/or external\ndisturbances. This is especially the case when, mathematically, the\ntransient synchronous state during the growth process becomes marginally\nstable, as a local perturbation can trigger a rapid deviation of the\nsystem from the vicinity of the synchronous state. In terms of the\nnodal dynamics, a large scale avalanche over the entire network can be\ntriggered in the sense that the individual nodal dynamics diverge from\nthe synchronous state in a cascading manner within a short time period.\nBecause of the high dimensionality of the networked system, the transient\nprocess for the system to recover to the synchronous state can be extremely\nlong. Introducing a tolerance threshold to identify the\ndesynchronized nodes, we find that, after an initial stage of linear\ngrowth, the network typically evolves into a critical state\nwhere the addition of a single new node can cause a group of nodes to\nlose synchronization, leading to synchronization collapse for the entire\nnetwork. A statistical analysis indicates that, the distribution of the\nsize of the collapse is approximately algebraic (power law), regardless\nof the fluctuations in the system parameters.

Consider, for example,\na modern infrastructure in a large metropolitan area. Due to the influx of\npopulation, the essential facilities such as the electrical power grids,\nthe roads, water supply, and all kinds of services need to grow accordingly.\nThe issue of how to maintain the performance of the growing systems under\ncertain constraints (e.g., quality of living) becomes critically important\nfrom the standpoint of sustainability. To develop a comprehensive theoretical\nframework to understand, at a quantitative level, the fundamental dynamics\nof sustainability in complex systems subject to continuous growth is\na challenging and open problem at the present. In this paper, to shed light\non how a complex network can maintain its function and how such a function\nmay be lost during growth, we focus on the dynamics of synchronization. In\nparticular, if a small network is synchronizable, as it grows in size the\nsynchronous state may collapse. The main purpose of the paper is to\nuncover and understand the dynamical features of synchronization collapse\nas the network grows. As will be explained, our main result is that the\ncollapse is essentially a self-organizing dynamical process towards\ncriticality with an algebraic scaling behavior.\n\nFrom the beginning of modern network science, growth has been\nrecognized and treated as an intrinsic property of complex\nnetworks~\\cite{AB:2002,Newman:2003}. For example, the pioneering model\nof scale free networks~\\cite{BA:1999} had growth as a fundamental\ningredient to generate the algebraic degree distribution. The growth\naspect of this model is, however, somewhat simplistic as it stipulates\na monotonic increasing behavior in the network size, whereas\nthe growth behavior in real world networks can be highly non-monotonic. For example, in technological networks such as the electric power grid,\nintroducing a new node (e.g., a power station) will increase the load on\nthe existing nodes in the network, which can trigger a cascade of failures\nwhen overload occurs~\\cite{Watts:2002,ML:2002,HK:2002,MGP:2002,MPSVV:2003,Holme:2002,GLKK:2003,CLM:2004,HYY:2006,GC:2007,HLC:2008,SBPBH:2008,Gleeson:2008,YWLC:2009,Whitney:2010,WYL:2010,HL:2011,WLA:2011,LWLW:2012,Helbing:2013,GTK:2014}.\nIn this case, the addition of a new node does not increase the network size\nbut instead results in a network collapse~\\cite{ML:2002,GTK:2014}. A\nsimilar phenomenon was also observed in ecological networks, where the\nintroduction of a new species may result in the extinction of many\nexisting species~\\cite{May:1972,PPP:2005}. In an economic crisis, the\nfailure of one financial institute can result in failures of many others\nin a cascading manner~\\cite{Financial_Crisis,WLA:2011}. To take\ninto account the phenomenon of non-monotonic network growth to avoid network\ncollapse, an earlier approach was to constrain the growth according to\ncertain functional requirement such as the system stability with respect\nto certain performance, i.e., to impose the criterion that the system\nmust be stable at all times~\\cite{May:1972}. It was revealed that network\ngrowth subject to a global stability constraint can lead to a\nnon-monotonic network growth without collapse~\\cite{PBTCC:2009}.\nConstraint based on network synchronization was proposed~\\cite{FW:2011},\nwhere it was demonstrated that imposing synchronization stability can\nresult in a highly selective and dynamic growth process~\\cite{FW:2011}\nin the sense that it often takes many time steps for a new node to be\nsuccessfully ``absorbed'' into the existing network.\n\nTo be concrete, we study the growth of complex networks under the\nconstraint of synchronization stability. Synchronization of coupled\nnonlinear oscillators has been an active area of research in nonlinear\nscience~\\cite{Kuramoto:book,Strogatz:book,PRK:book,FY:1983,PC:1990},\nand it is an important\ntype of collective dynamics on complex networks~\\cite{ADGKMZ:2008}.\nEarlier studies focused on systems of regular coupling structures, e.g.,\nlattices or globally coupled networks. The discovery of the small\nworld~\\cite{WS:1998} and scale free~\\cite{BA:1999} network\ntopologies in realistic systems generated a great deal of interest in\nstudying the interplay between complex network structure and\nsynchronization~\\cite{BP:2002,NMLH:2003,DHM:2005,BHLN:2005,ORHK:2005,ROH:2005,HPLYY:2006,BBH:2006,WHLL:2007,GMA:2007,GWLL:2008,HLG:2008a,HLG:2008b,WHGLL:2008,PSHMR:2014}.\nSince the structures of many realistic networks are not static but\nevolve with time~\\cite{DM:2002,HN:2006}, synchronization in time-varying\ncomplex networks was also studied~\\cite{SBR:2006,PSBS:2006,KDL:2013}\nto reveal the dynamical interplay between the time-dependent network\nstructure and synchronization~\\cite{DHM:2005,GZ:2006,RHMRG:2009}.\nWe note that there was a line of works that addressed the effect on\nsynchronization of different ways that the network structure evolves\nwith time, such as link rewiring~\\cite{KS:2007,SO:2008}, adjustment\nof coupling weights~\\cite{ZK:2006,LGL:2011}, change in the coupling\nscheme~\\cite{SKHJ:2009,LWFDL:2011}, but in these works the network size\nis assumed to be fixed.\n\nTo investigate the growth of stability-constrained complex networks,\na key issue is the different time scales involved in the dynamical\nevolution~\\cite{PBTCC:2009,FW:2011,Butts:2009}. For network growth\nconstrained by synchronization, there are two key time scales:\none associated with the transient synchronization dynamics\noccurred in a static network, denoted as $T_s$, and another\ncharacterizing the speed of network growth, e.g., the time\ninterval between two successive nodal additions, $T_g$. The interplay\nbetween the two time scales can result in distinct network evolution\ndynamics. For example, for $T_s \\gg T_g$, the stability constraint\nwould have little effect on the network evolution and, in an\napproximate sense, the network grows as if no constraint were imposed.\nHowever, for $T_s \\ll T_g$, the network remains synchronized at\nall times. In particular, since the stability is determined by the\nnetwork structure, e.g., through the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix,\nthe dynamics of network evolution is effectively decoupled from that\nof synchronization. For $T_s\\approx T_g$, complicated network evolution\ndynamics can arise~\\cite{Butts:2009}, where the two types of dynamical\nprocesses, i.e., growth and synchronization, are entangled.\nDepending on the instant network structure and synchronization\nbehavior, the addition of a new node may either increase\nor decrease the network size. For example, if the new node induces a\ndesynchronization avalanche, a number of nodes will be removed if their\nsynchronization errors exceed some threshold values, resulting in a sudden\ndecrease of the network size and potentially a large scale collapse.\n\nIn this paper, we focus on the regime of $T_s\\approx T_g$ and introduce\na tolerance threshold to determine if a node has become desynchronized.\nSpecifically, after each transient period of evolution, we remove all\nnodes with synchronization error exceeding this threshold. During the\ncourse of evolution, the network can collapse at random times.\nStrikingly, we find that the size of the collapses follows an algebraic\nscaling law, indicating that the network growth dynamics under the\nsynchronization constraint can be regarded as a process towards\nself-organized criticality (SOC).\n\nIn Sec.~\\ref{sec:model}, we describe our network growth model subject to\nsynchronization constraint and demonstrate the phenomenon of network\ncollapse. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:statistics}, we analyze the dynamical and\nstatistical properties of the collapses. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:theory}, we\nuse the method of eigenvector analysis to explain the numerically observed\ncollapse phenomenon. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:alt_model}, we study continuous\ntime dynamics on randomly growing networks to demonstrate the generality\nof the synchronization based collapse phenomenon and its SOC characteristics.\nIn Sec.~\\ref{sec:conclusion}, we present conclusions and discuss the\nimplications of the main results.\n\n\\section{Model of network growth subject to synchronization constraint}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nWe consider the standard scale-free growth model~\\cite{BA:1999} but\nimpose a synchronization-based constraint for nodal removal. Specifically,\nstarting from a small, synchronizable core of $m_0$ coupled nonlinear\noscillators (nodes), at each time step $n_g$ of network growth, we\nadd a new node with random initial condition into the network. The new\nnode is connected to $m$ existing nodes according to the preferential\nattachment probability $\\Pi_i=k_i/\\sum_{j}k_j$, where $i,j=1,2,\\ldots,n$\nare the nodal indices and $k_i$ is the degree of the $i$th node. We\nthen monitor the system evolution for a fixed time period ($T_g$) and\ncalculate the nodal synchronization error $\\delta r_i$ (to be defined\nbelow). Defining $\\delta r_c$ as the tolerance threshold for nodal\ndesynchronization, if all nodes in the network meet the condition\n$\\delta r_i<\\delta r_c$, the network size will be increased by one.\nOtherwise, the nodes with $\\delta r_i>\\delta r_c$ will be removed from\nthe network, together with the links attached to them.

The coupling\nstrength is fixed at $\\varepsilon=1$. The initial network consists of\n$m_0=8$ globally coupled nodes, which is synchronizable for the given\ncoupling strength. For a fixed time interval $T_g=300$, we introduce\na new node (map) into the network with a randomly chosen initial condition\nin the interval $(0,1)$ by attaching it to the existing nodes according\nto the preferential attachment rule. The synchronization error is defined\nas $\\delta r_i=|x_i-\\left<x\\right>|$ with $\\left<x\\right>=\\sum_i x_i/n$\nbeing the network-averaged state, which is calculated at the end of each\ntime interval $T_g$. We set the tolerance threshold to be\n$\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$ (somewhat arbitrarily). The growing process\nis terminated either if the network has completely collapsed\n($n\\approx 0$) or when its size reaches a preset upper bound (e.g, 1000).\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:growth} shows the network size $n$\nversus the time step $n_g$. We see that, after an initial\nperiod of linear growth ($n_g \\le 123$), the network size is suddenly\ndecreased from $n=128$ to $103$, signifying that a collapse event of size\n$\\Delta n=25$ has occurred after the addition of the $124$th oscillator.\nAfter the collapse, the network begins to expand again. In the subsequent\ntime evolution, collapse of different sizes occurs at random times, e.g.,\n$\\Delta n=22$ at $n_g=379$ and $\\Delta n=10$ at $n_g=418$. For relatively\nsmall network size, when a collapse event occurs, the removed nodes\naccount for only a small fraction of the nodes in the entire network\n(e.g., $\\Delta n/n < 10\\%$), with growth followed immediately after\nthe collapse. However, as the network size exceeds a critical value,\nsay $n_{max}=400$, this scenario of small-scale collapse followed by\ngrowth is changed dramatically. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(a),\nfor $n_g=471$, a catastrophic collapse event occurs, which removes over\n$75\\%$ of the nodes in the network (from $471$ to $111$). More strikingly,\nthere is no growth after the event - the network continues to collapse.\nAt the end of $n_g = 472$, not a single node remains in the network,\ni.e., the network has collapsed {\\em completely}.\n\nTo gain more insights into the dynamics of network collapse, we monitor\nthe system evolution for the time period $123T_g<t<124T_g$, i.e., the\nresponse of the network dynamics to the addition of the $124$th node.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:growth}(b) shows the time evolution of the averaged\nnetwork synchronization error,\n$\\left<\\delta r\\right>=\\sum_i \\delta r_i/n$, where its value approaches\nzero rapid with time. A semi-logarithmic plot reveals an exponentially\ndecreasing behavior for $\\left<\\delta r\\right>$ [inset of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(b)], indicating that the network is able to restore\nsynchronization for relatively large values of $T_g$. However, for $T_g=300$,\nat the end of the time interval $t=124T_g$, the synchronization errors of\ncertain nodes exceed the threshold, leading to their removal from\nthe network. The synchronization errors for three typical nodes are\nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(c). Examining the individual nodal\nsynchronization errors $\\delta r_i$, we find that, the ``disturbance''\ntriggered by the addition of a new node spreads quickly over the network,\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(d). After the disturbance reaches the\nmaximal dynamical range at $t\\approx 123T_g+5$ [Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(e)], it\nbegins to shrink and, at the end of this time interval, there are still a\nfew nodes with $\\delta r>\\delta r_c$, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(f).\nBased on their dynamical responses, the nodes can be roughly\ndivided into three categories, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(c).\nSpecifically, for most nodes, as time increases $\\delta r$ first increases\nand then decreases, e.g., the $126$th node. There are also nodes for which\nthe values of $\\delta r$ decrease monotonically with time, e.g., the $125$th\nnode. Finally, there are a few nodes for which the values of $\\delta r$\nremain about $0$, e.g., the $129$th node. We also observe that, sometimes,\nthe new node, whose introduction into the network triggers a network collapse,\nin fact remains in the network.\n\n\\section{Statistical properties of collapse and self-organized\ncriticality} \\label{sec:statistics}\n\nIn terms of practical significance, the following questions about network\ncollapse are of interest: (1) what kind of nodes are more likely to be\nremoved? (2) what is the size distribution of the collapse? (3) how\nfrequent is the network collapsed? and (4) what are the effects of\nthe tolerance threshold $\\delta r_c$ and growing interval $T_g$ on the\ncollapse? In this section we address these questions numerically.\n\nA simple way to identify the removed nodes is to examine their degrees.\nWith the same parameters as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}, we plot in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:statistics}(a) the normalized degree distribution, $p_{del}(k)$,\nof the removed nodes collected from a large number of collapse events\n(except the catastrophic one that totally destroys the network). We see\nthat the distribution contains approximately three distinct segments with\ndifferent scaling behaviors. Specifically, for $k\\in[1,m]$, $p_{del}(k)$\nincreases with $k$ exponentially. For $k\\in[m,40]$, $p_{del}(k)$ decreases\nwith $k$ algebraically with the exponent $\\gamma\\approx -2.83$. For\n$k\\in[40, 120]$, $p_{del}(k)$ decreases with $k$ exponentially. Since,\nin our model each new node has $m=8$ links, it is somewhat surprising to\nsee from Fig.~\\ref{fig:statistics}(a) that some nodes have their degrees\nsmaller than $m$. This phenomenon can be attributed to the node removal\nmechanism: when a node is removed, all links associated to it are also\nremoved. Another phenomenon is that $p_{del}(k)$ reaches its maximum\nat $k=8$, which seems to contradict the previous result that nodes of\nlarge degrees are more stable with respect to synchronization than those of\nsmall degrees~\\cite{MZK:2005,ZK:2006,WLL:2007,PC:2015}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{Graph2.eps}\n\\caption{(Color online) Statistical properties of collapse and SOC.\n(a) Degree distribution $p_{del}(k)$ of the removed nodes (filled circles).\nFor $k\\in[m,40]$, the scaling behavior is $p_{del}(k)\\sim k^{\\gamma}$, with\n$\\gamma\\approx -2.83$. For $k\\le m$ and $k\\ge 40$, $p_{del}(k)$ increases\nand decreases with $k$ exponentially, respectively. Open squares are for\nthe degree distribution $p(k)$ of the generated network. (b) Size\ndistribution $p_{col}(\\Delta n)$ of the collapse event for parameters\n$T_{g}=300$ and $\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$.

Open squares are for the size distribution of the\ncollapse events for $T_{g}=200$ and $\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$. The algebraic\nscaling of the collapse size signifies SOC. The results are averaged over\n$100$ network realizations.}\n\\label{fig:statistics}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSince $p_{del}(k)$ is obtained from a large number of collapses, to uncover\nthe interplay between nodal stability and degree, we need to take into\naccount the degree distribution $p(k)$ of the generated network. To find\n$p(k)$, we use the largest network emerged in the growth process (the\nnetwork formed immediately before the catastrophic collapse) and obtain the\ndegree distribution for an ensemble of such networks. The results are\nalso shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:statistics}(a). We see that the two\ndistributions, $p_{del}(k)$ and $p(k)$, coincide with each other well,\nwhere $p(k)$ also contains three distinct segments and reaches its\nmaximum at $k=m$. The consistency between $p_{del}(k)$ and $p(k)$\nsuggests that the nodal stability is independent of the degree.\nStatistically, we thus expect that the small and large degree nodes\nto have equal probability to be removed.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:statistics}(b) shows the collapse size distribution,\nwhere the catastrophic network size $n_{max}$ is not included.\nWe see that, in the interval $\\Delta n\\in [1,100]$, the distribution\nfollows an algebraic scaling: $p_{col}(\\Delta n)\\sim \\Delta n^{\\gamma}$,\nwith $\\gamma\\approx -0.85$. For $\\Delta n>100$, an exponential tail is\nobserved. To test whether the exponential tail is a result of the finite\nsize effect, we decrease the transient period to $T_g=200$ and plot the\ndistribution of the collapse size again. (As we will demonstrate later,\nas $T_g$ is decreased, the maximum network size $n_{max}$ will decrease\nmonotonically.) Figure~\\ref{fig:statistics}(b) indicates that, comparing\nwith the case of $T_g=300$, the regime of algebraic scaling is shifted\ntoward the left for $T_g=200$. Specifically, for $T_g=200$, we have\n$p_{col}(\\Delta n)\\sim \\Delta n^{\\gamma}$ in the interval\n$\\Delta n\\in [1,50]$, where the fitted exponent is about $-0.79$.\n\nThe emergence of algebraic scaling in the size distribution of network\ncollapse is interesting from the viewpoint of SOC that occurs in many\nreal-world complex systems. For a dynamical system subject to continuous\nexternal perturbations, during its evolution towards SOC, it can appear\nstable for a long period of time before a catastrophic event occurs, and\nthe probability for the catastrophe can be markedly larger than\nintuitively expected (algebraic versus exponential\nscaling)~\\cite{BTW:1987,Stanley:book}. In our case, there is a long time\nperiod of synchronization stability in spite of the small-size collapses, but\ncatastrophic collapses that remove all or most of the nodes in the network\ncan occur, albeit rarely. There are a variety of models for SOC, but the\nunique feature of our model is that it exploits network synchronization\nstability as a mechanism for catastrophic failures. Since synchronization\nis ubiquitous in natural and man-made complex systems, the finding of SOC\nin synchronization-stability-constrained network may have broad implications.\nFor instance, synchronization is commonly regarded as the dynamical basis\nfor normal functioning of the power grids~\\cite{MMAN:2013}, and\nthere is empirical evidence that the size of the blackouts follows roughly\nan algebraic distribution~\\cite{PA:2013}.\n\nWe proceed to study the frequency of network collapse. Let $\\Delta n'$ be\nthe period of continuous network growth, i.e., the number of nodes\nsuccessively added into the network between two adjacent collapses.\nThe collapse frequency is $f=1/\\left<\\Delta n'\\right>$, where\n$\\left<\\Delta n'\\right>$ is the averaged period.\nFor the same parameters in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}, we find\n$f\\approx 1/21$. That is, on average the network collapses every $21$\nnew additions. Since the synchronization errors are evaluated at the\nend of each transient interval and nodes are removed according to a\npredefined tolerance threshold, we expect the collapse\nfrequency to depend on the parameters $T_g$ and $\\delta r_c$. This\nis apparent in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(a), where the network growth\nunder the parameters $T_g=300$ and $\\delta r_c= 10^{-9}$ is also\nshown. We see that, comparing with the case of $\\delta r_c= 10^{-10}$,\nthe catastrophic collapse is postponed. To assess the influence of $T_g$\nand $\\delta r_c$ on $f$, we show in Fig.~\\ref{fig:frequency}(a) $f$\nversus $T_g$ for different values of $\\delta r_c$. It can be seen that,\nwith the increase of $T_g$ or $\\delta r_c$, $f$ decreases monotonically.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{Graph3.eps}\n\\caption{(Color online) Behavior of the collapse frequency.\n(a) The collapse frequency $f$ as a function of the transient interval $T_g$\nfor different values of the tolerance threshold $\\delta r_c$.

The results are averaged over $100$ network\nrealizations.}\n\\label{fig:frequency}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor the process of network growth, two particularly relevant quantities\nare: (1) the critical network size $n_1$ at which the first collapse\noccurs and (2) the maximum network size $n_{max}$ beyond which a\ncatastrophic collapse occurs. Similar to the collapse frequency, these\ntwo quantities depend on the parameters $T_g$ and $\\delta r_c$.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:frequency}(b) shows $n_1$ ($n_{max}$) versus $T_g$ for\ndifferent values of $\\delta r_c$. We see that, as $T_g$ or $\\delta r_c$\nis increased, $n_1$ ($n_{max}$) increases monotonically. That is, by\nincreasing $T_g$ or $\\delta r_c$, one can postpone the first and the\ncatastrophic network collapse but eventually it will occur.\n\n\n\\section{Physical theory of synchronization based network collapse}\n\\label{sec:theory}\n\nSay at step $n'$ of the growth, the network contains $n-1$ synchronized\noscillators and a new oscillator of random initial condition is introduced.\nDue to the new oscillator, the trajectories of the existing oscillators\nleave, at least temporarily, the synchronous manifold $\\mathbf{x}_s$. Let\n$\\delta \\mathbf{x}_i=\\mathbf{x}_i-\\mathbf{x}_s$ be the distance of the\n$i$th oscillator from the manifold, which is the synchronization error.\nThe evolution of $\\delta \\mathbf{x}_i$ is governed by the following\nvariational equation:\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:var}\n\\delta\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_i = \\mathbf{DF}(\\mathbf{x}_s) \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{x}_i\n+ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{k_i}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}\n\\mathbf{DH}(\\mathbf{x}_s)\\cdot [\\delta \\mathbf{x}_j - \\delta\\mathbf{x}_i],\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\delta\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_{i}=\\mathbf{DF}(\\mathbf{x}_{s})\\cdot\\delta\\mathbf{x}_{i%&#10;}+\\frac{\\varepsilon}{k_{i}}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{ij}\\mathbf{DH}(\\mathbf{x}_{s})%&#10;\\cdot[\\delta\\mathbf{x}_{j}-\\delta\\mathbf{x}_{i}],\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc05</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>\u03b4</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><mi>\u03b5</mi><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc07</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u22c5</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc31</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01052.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\bm{\\xi}_{l}$ is the $l$th mode transverse to the synchronous\nmanifold $\\mathbf{x}_s$, and $0=\\sigma_1>\\sigma_2> \\ldots > \\sigma_n$\nare the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix $C$. Among the $n$ modes,\nthe one associated with $\\sigma =0$ represents the motion within the\nsynchronous manifold. The network is synchronizable only when all the\ntransverse modes ($\\bm{\\xi}_j, j=2,\\ldots,n$) are stable, i.e.,\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent among these modes should be negative:\n$\\Lambda (\\sigma)<0$. For typical nonlinear oscillators and smooth\ncoupling functions, previous works~\\cite{PC:1998,HYL:1998,HCLP:2009} showed\nthat $\\Lambda (\\sigma)$ can be negative within a bounded region in the\nparameter space of $\\sigma$, i.e., $\\Lambda(\\sigma)<0$ for\n$\\sigma\\in\\left(\\sigma_{l}, \\sigma_{r}\\right)$. Thus, the necessary\ncondition to make the synchronous state stable is\n$\\sigma_l<\\sigma_j<\\sigma_r$ for all the transverse modes ($j=2,\\ldots,n$).\nFor the chaotic logistic map used in our numerical simulations, we have\n$\\sigma_l=0.5$ and $\\sigma_r=1.5$.\n\nThe eigenvalue analysis, also known as the master stability function (MSF)\nanalysis, is standard in synchronization analysis~\\cite{PC:1998,HYL:1998}.\nIt not only indicates whether a network is synchronizable, but also\nquantifies the degree of synchronization stability as well as the\nsynchronization speed in certain situations~\\cite{Wackerbauer:2007,QHSWC:2008,\nBGT:2008}. Specifically, by examining the Lyapunov exponents associated\nwith the two extreme modes, $\\Lambda(\\sigma_2)$ and $\\Lambda(\\sigma_n)$,\none can predict whether the network is synchronizable and how stable\n(unstable) the synchronous state is. In general, the smaller\n$\\Lambda(\\sigma_2)$ and $\\Lambda(\\sigma_n)$ are, the more stable the\nsynchronous state is~\\cite{PC:1998,HYL:1998,HCLP:2009}.\nBecause of the relation $\\Lambda(\\sigma_{2,n})\\propto \\sigma_{2,n}$, near\nthe critical points $\\sigma_l$ and $\\sigma_r$, the network synchronizability\ncan be characterized by the stability distances $d_{l}=\\sigma_{2}-\\sigma_{l}$\nand $d_{r}=\\sigma_{r}-\\sigma_{n}$. For a synchronizable network, we\nhave $d_{l,r}>0$. Moreover, the larger $d_l$ and $d_r$ are, the more stable\nthe synchronous state will be. Otherwise, if one of the distances is\nnegative, the synchronous state will be unstable. In the asynchronous\ncase, the smaller $d_l$ and $d_r$ are, the more unstable the synchronous\nstate will be.\n\nAs the network synchronizability can be characterized by the stability\ndistances $d_{l,r}$, we calculate the evolution of $d_{l,r}$ during\nthe course of network growth, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:distance}(a).\nIn accordance with the process of network growth (Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}),\nthe time evolution of $d_{l,r}$ also consists of distinct regimes. Firstly,\nas $n_g$ increase from 1 to $123$, $d_{l,r}$ approaches zero quickly.\nSecondly, in the interval $n_g\\in(123,470)$, $d_{l,r}$ remains about zero.\nA magnification of this interval reveals that, while $d_{l,r}$ tend to\nreach zero, the process is occasionally interrupted by some small\nincrements. Checking the points at which $d_{l,r}$ increase suddenly [inset\nof Fig.~\\ref{fig:distance}(a)], we find that these points correspond to\nexactly the time instants of network collapses. For example, for\n$n_g=379$, $d_l$ increases from $0.032$ to $0.041$\n[Fig.~\\ref{fig:distance}(a)], while at the same time there is a collapse\nevent in which the network size changes from $n=344$ to $322$\n[Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(a)]. Finally, at the critical instant $n_g=472$\nwhere the catastrophic collapse occurs, $d_{l}$ and $d_{r}$ change suddenly\nto $0.21$ and $0.22$, respectively.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{Graph4.eps}\n\\caption{(Color online) Behavior of synchronization distances.\n(a) Time evolution of the stability distances $d_{l,r}$.

The results are\naveraged over $100$ network realizations.}\n\\label{fig:distance}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:distance} thus indicates that, for the entire process of\nnetwork growth, the stability distances $d_{l,r}$ remain positive so that\nthe network is synchronizable at all time.

In particular, if $|e_{j',i}|>e_c$, we have\n$\\delta r_i > \\delta r_c$ so that the oscillator will be removed; otherwise\nit will remain in the network. Assuming the oscillators have the same\ninitial error $\\delta r(0)$, we can estimate the size of the network collapse\nsimply by counting the number of elements satisfying the inequality\n$|e_{j',i}|>e_c$. To verify this idea, we generate scale-free networks,\ncalculate the eigenvector $\\bm{e}_2$, and identify the largest element\n$e_{max}$ of $\\bm{e}_2$. Choosing $e_c$ randomly from the range $(0,e_{max})$\n[since $d(0)$ is dependent upon the (random) initial condition of the newly\nadded oscillator], we truncate the eigenvector elements, where the number of\ntruncated elements is the collapse size.

In fact, in network modeling,\nthe way by which a new node is added to the existing network can have\na determining role in the network structure~\\cite{AB:2002}. For example,\nin unconstrained growing networks, random attachment cannot lead to\nany scale free feature but results in an exponential degree\ndistribution~\\cite{BAJ:1999}. Since the network structure has a\nsignificant effect on synchronization, we expect the characteristics of\nnetwork growth dynamics following random attachment to be different from\nthose from the preferential attachment rule. Besides the network\nstructure, our eigenvector analysis indicates that the synchronization\nbehavior is also dependent upon the nodal dynamics and the coupling\nfunction. For example, for a different type of nodal dynamics, the\nMSF curve can be dramatically different, so is the stability parameter\nregion~\\cite{PC:1998,HYL:1998,HCLP:2009}. We are led by these\nconsiderations to study continuous-time oscillator networks that\ngrow according to the random attachment rule.\n\nWe choose the chaotic R\\\"{o}ssler oscillator~\\cite{Rossler:1976} described by\n$(dx/dt,dy/dt,dz/dt) = (-y-z,x+0.2y,0.2+xz-9.0z)$. The oscillators at\ndifferent nodes are coupled through the $x$ variable with the coupling\nfunction $\\mathbf{H}([x,y,z]^T ) = [0,y,0]^T$. We define the synchronization\nerror as $\\delta r_i=|x_i-\\left<x\\right>|$. The coupling strength is fixed\nat $\\varepsilon=0.35$. The stable synchronization region from the MSF curve\nis open at the right side~\\cite{HCLP:2009}, i.e., the transverse mode $i$ is\nstable for $\\sigma_i>\\sigma_l\\approx 0.157$. Adopting the random attachment\nrule, we grow the network under the constraint of synchronization\nstability and find the phenomenon of network collapse to be robust. For\nexample, Fig.~\\ref{fig:rossler}(a) shows the critical network size $n_1$ versus\nthe transient time $T_g$ for different values of the tolerance threshold\n$\\delta r_c$. We see that, while $n_1$ increases monotonically with $T_g$\nand $\\delta r_c$, the rate is somewhat smaller than that associated with the\npreferential attachment rule [Fig.~\\ref{fig:frequency}(b)], indicating\nthat the random attachment rule tends to make network collapses more frequent.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:rossler}(b) shows the algebraic distribution of the\ncollapse size: $p_{col}(\\Delta n)\\sim \\Delta n^{\\gamma}$ for\n$\\Delta n\\in [1,50]$, with $\\gamma\\approx -0.58$. These results suggest\nthat the SOC characteristics of the network collapse phenomenon are robust,\nregardless of the details of the network growth mechanism and of the\nnodal dynamical processes.\n\nFor the randomly growing chaotic R\\\"{o}ssler network, we find that the\nrelationship between the synchronization error $\\delta r_i$ and the\neigenvector element $e_{2,i}$ can still be described by \\eqref{eq:delta_r_i}\n[inset in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rossler}(b)]. However, when analyzing the algebraic\nsize distribution using the eigenvectors, we note that the agreement between\nthe theoretical predication and the direct simulation results is not as\ngood as that for the preferential attachment growth rule. For example,\nby truncating the eigenvector $\\bm{e}_2$ of a random network of $n=800$\nnodes, we obtain $p'_{col}(\\Delta n) \\sim \\Delta n^{\\gamma'}$ with\n$\\gamma'\\approx -0.94$. The difference in the value of the algebraic\nscaling exponent can be attributed to the limited size of the network\ngenerated subject to the synchronization constraint as well as to the\nrelatively short transient period (small values of $T_g$). In fact,\nin a computationally feasible implementation of the random growth model\nwith continuous-time dynamics, the largest network generated has the\nsize $n\\approx 50$, rendering somewhat severe the finite size effect.\nNonetheless, in spite of the finite-size effect, the SOC features of the\nnetwork collapse phenomenon are robust.\n\n\\section{Conclusions} \\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nGrowth or expansion is a fundamental feature of complex networks in\nnature, society, and technological systems. Growth, however, is often\nsubject to constraints. Traditional models of complex networks contain\ncertain growth mechanism, such as one based on the\npreferential attachment rule~\\cite{BA:1999}, but impose no constraint.\nApparently, when growth is constrained, typically the network cannot\nexpand indefinitely, nor can its size be a monotonous function of time.\nAs a result, during the growth process there must be times when the\nnetwork size is reduced (collapse). But are there generic features\nof the collapse events? For example, statistically what is the\ndistribution of the collapse size, and are there universal\ncharacteristics in the distribution?\n\nThis paper addresses these intriguing questions using synchronization\nas a concrete type of constraint. In particular, taking into account the\neffects of desynchronization tolerance and synchronization speed, we\npropose and investigate growing complex networks subject to the\nconstraint of synchronization stability. We find that, as new nodes\nare continuously added into the network, it can self-organize itself\ninto a critical state where the addition of a single node can trigger\na large scale collapse. Statistical analysis of the characteristics\nof the collapse events such as the degree distribution of the collapsed\nnodes, the collapse frequency, and the collapse size distribution,\nindicates that constraint induced network collapse can be viewed as\nan evolutionary process towards self-organized criticality. The SOC\nfeature is especially pronounced as the collapse size follows an\nalgebraic scaling law. We develop an eigenvector analysis to understand the\norigin of the network collapse phenomenon and the associated scaling\nbehaviors.\n\nIn a modern society, cities and infrastructures continue to expand.\nIn social media, various groups (social networks) keep growing. When\nconstraints are imposed, e.g., manifested as governmental policies or\nonline security rules, how would the underlying network respond? Can\nconstraints lead to large scale, catastrophic collapse of the entire\nnetwork? These are difficult but highly pertinent questions. Our findings\nprovide some hints about the dynamical features of the network collapse\nphenomenon, but much further efforts are needed in this\ndirection of complex systems research.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina under Grant No.~11375109 and by the Fundamental Research Funds\nfor the Central Universities under Grant No.~GK201303002.

Among the $n$ modes,\nthe one associated with $\\sigma =0$ represents the motion within the\nsynchronous manifold. The network is synchronizable only when all the\ntransverse modes ($\\bm{\\xi}_j, j=2,\\ldots,n$) are stable, i.e.,\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent among these modes should be negative:\n$\\Lambda (\\sigma)<0$. For typical nonlinear oscillators and smooth\ncoupling functions, previous works~\\cite{PC:1998,HYL:1998,HCLP:2009} showed\nthat $\\Lambda (\\sigma)$ can be negative within a bounded region in the\nparameter space of $\\sigma$, i.e., $\\Lambda(\\sigma)<0$ for\n$\\sigma\\in\\left(\\sigma_{l}, \\sigma_{r}\\right)$. Thus, the necessary\ncondition to make the synchronous state stable is\n$\\sigma_l<\\sigma_j<\\sigma_r$ for all the transverse modes ($j=2,\\ldots,n$).\nFor the chaotic logistic map used in our numerical simulations, we have\n$\\sigma_l=0.5$ and $\\sigma_r=1.5$.\n\nThe eigenvalue analysis, also known as the master stability function (MSF)\nanalysis, is standard in synchronization analysis~\\cite{PC:1998,HYL:1998}.\nIt not only indicates whether a network is synchronizable, but also\nquantifies the degree of synchronization stability as well as the\nsynchronization speed in certain situations~\\cite{Wackerbauer:2007,QHSWC:2008,\nBGT:2008}. Specifically, by examining the Lyapunov exponents associated\nwith the two extreme modes, $\\Lambda(\\sigma_2)$ and $\\Lambda(\\sigma_n)$,\none can predict whether the network is synchronizable and how stable\n(unstable) the synchronous state is. In general, the smaller\n$\\Lambda(\\sigma_2)$ and $\\Lambda(\\sigma_n)$ are, the more stable the\nsynchronous state is~\\cite{PC:1998,HYL:1998,HCLP:2009}.\nBecause of the relation $\\Lambda(\\sigma_{2,n})\\propto \\sigma_{2,n}$, near\nthe critical points $\\sigma_l$ and $\\sigma_r$, the network synchronizability\ncan be characterized by the stability distances $d_{l}=\\sigma_{2}-\\sigma_{l}$\nand $d_{r}=\\sigma_{r}-\\sigma_{n}$. For a synchronizable network, we\nhave $d_{l,r}>0$. Moreover, the larger $d_l$ and $d_r$ are, the more stable\nthe synchronous state will be. Otherwise, if one of the distances is\nnegative, the synchronous state will be unstable. In the asynchronous\ncase, the smaller $d_l$ and $d_r$ are, the more unstable the synchronous\nstate will be.\n\nAs the network synchronizability can be characterized by the stability\ndistances $d_{l,r}$, we calculate the evolution of $d_{l,r}$ during\nthe course of network growth, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:distance}(a).\nIn accordance with the process of network growth (Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}),\nthe time evolution of $d_{l,r}$ also consists of distinct regimes. Firstly,\nas $n_g$ increase from 1 to $123$, $d_{l,r}$ approaches zero quickly.\nSecondly, in the interval $n_g\\in(123,470)$, $d_{l,r}$ remains about zero.\nA magnification of this interval reveals that, while $d_{l,r}$ tend to\nreach zero, the process is occasionally interrupted by some small\nincrements. Checking the points at which $d_{l,r}$ increase suddenly [inset\nof Fig.~\\ref{fig:distance}(a)], we find that these points correspond to\nexactly the time instants of network collapses. For example, for\n$n_g=379$, $d_l$ increases from $0.032$ to $0.041$\n[Fig.~\\ref{fig:distance}(a)], while at the same time there is a collapse\nevent in which the network size changes from $n=344$ to $322$\n[Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth}(a)]. Finally, at the critical instant $n_g=472$\nwhere the catastrophic collapse occurs, $d_{l}$ and $d_{r}$ change suddenly\nto $0.21$ and $0.22$, respectively.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{Graph4.eps}\n\\caption{(Color online) Behavior of synchronization distances.\n(a) Time evolution of the stability distances $d_{l,r}$.
