Although our observations in $V$ and \n$I$ bands are restricted to a single epoch, the estimated polarization parameters in both \nstudies are similar. \nIn order to examine the simultaneous behaviour of the polarization and the polarization\nangle of SN 2014J, the observed $Q$-$U$ Stokes parameters are plotted in Figure~\\ref{qu}, where \neach number represents a data pair of the $Q$-$U$ vector in $R$-band. The limited data points, although indicative\nof these vectors being aligned along a line (within observational uncertainties), are not sufficient to\ndraw conclusions on the geometry of the ejecta.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the photometric properties of SN 2014J show similarity with \nSN 2011fe, SN 2005cf and SN 2003du (see Sec~\\ref{lc}). These SNe Ia showed relatively low host galaxy extinction\n\\citep[c.f.][]{Anupama05,Pastorello07,Patat13p}.\n\\citet{Smith11p} presented multi-epoch spectropolarimetric observations of SN 2011fe \nand inferred asymmetry in the photosphere with intrinsic continuum polarization between 0.2 -- 0.4 per cent. \nAdditionally, they found a shift in polarization angle of 90$\\degr$ during the follow-up \nperiod (up to $43$d after the explosion), implying a time-dependent large-scale asymmetry in \nthe explosion. In a similar study of SN 2003du, \\citet{Leonard05p} estimated an \nintrinsic polarization of 0.3 per cent and predicted clumps in the ejecta.\n\nBased on the data set presented here, it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion about the SN ejecta and intrinsic\npolarization properties of SN 2014J. However, the results show consistency with that of K14 and \n\\citet{Patat15}.\nAs stated previously, there is no significant variation in the polarization parameters of this \nevent. Nonetheless, as discussed by \\citet{Maeda15}, it is possible that a combination of phenomena\n(e.g. multiple scattering and ISM absorption) is responsible for such an abnormally high observed\ndegree of polarization for SN 2014J. \nThe near constant polarization in $R$-band over nearly 70 days suggests that the polarization signal was of \ninterstellar origin and the SN was likely minimally polarized.\nUsing high resolution spectra, \\citet{Ritchey15} concluded a wide range of physical/environmental\nconditions in the ISM of M82. \nThe light echo properties of this event also indicate a complex structure for the interstellar dust in the host \ngalaxy \\citep{Crotts15}. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{centering}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{fig05_new.eps}\n\\caption{Temporal evolution of the observed polarization parameters of SN~2014J. \nThe upper and lower panels represent the polarization angle and degree of polarization,\nrespectively.

The broadband optical and NIR magnitudes were corrected for extinction assuming  $E(B-V)_{true} = 1.24$ \nfor a Galactic extinction law with $R_V = 1.44$, which are the best-fit values obtained by \\citet{Foley14}.\nFollowing \\citet{Foley14}, we use $E(B-V)_{MW} = 0.05$ to account for Milky Way reddening. \\\\\nThe extinction-corrected magnitudes were then converted to monochromatic fluxes using the zero points from \n\\citet{Bessell98}. A spline curve was then fit through the monochromatic fluxes and the resulting curve was integrated \nunder appropriate limits of wavelength as determined from the filter response curves, to yield the quasi-bolometric flux \nfor the particular epoch. \nIn order to estimate the UV contribution to the bolometric flux, we use the \\emph{HST} spectra presented by \\citet{Foley14}.\nIt may be noted that a significant portion of the HST UV spectra at the blue end had to be rejected owing to poor signal.\nThe UV contribution estimated here for SN 2014J might thus be treated as a lower limit.\nWe estimate that the UV contribution falls rapidly from $\\sim 4 \\%$ at $-5$d to $<1 \\%$ beyond +20d for SN 2014J. \nThe diminishing UV contribution is taken into account up to $\\sim 30$ days since $B$-band maximum.\nThe peak contribution from UV to the bolometric flux was found to be $\\sim 13 \\%$ for SN 2011fe \\citep{Pereira13}\nand $\\sim 19 \\%$ for SN 2013dy \\citep{Pan15}, which is higher than our estimate of $\\sim 4 \\%$ for SN 2014J \nusing \\emph{HST} spectra. \n\n$JHK_s$ photometry is not available beyond $+88$d, and $U$-band photometry is not available\nbeyond $+115$d. Thus, we use only the $UBVRI$ magnitudes to estimate the quasi-bolometric fluxes between +88 to +115d, \nand only $BVRI$ magnitudes thereafter.\n\n\n\nThe UVOIR bolometric light curve of SN 2014J is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:bol_comp}, along with the\nbolometric light curves of SN 2011fe, SN 2005cf and SN 2003du. The bolometric light curves of SNe \n2011fe \\citep{Richmond12}, 2005cf \\citep{Pastorello07} and 2003du \\citep{Anupama05} were constructed using the \npublished $UBVRI$ magnitudes. A 20 $\\%$ constant contribution  was added in order to account for missing flux from UV \nand NIR passbands for SNe 2011fe, 2005cf and 2003du.\n\nSN 2014J reached a peak UVOIR bolometric magnitude of $M_{bol}^{max} \\approx -18.9 \\pm 0.20$, which is similar to the peak\nbolometric magnitudes of the normal SNe 2011fe, 2005cf and 2003du.\nThe date of explosion for SN 2014J was reported to be January 14.75 UT \\citep{Zheng14} and 14.54 UT \\citep{Goobar15}.\nAssuming an explosion date of 14.65 UT, which is the average of the above estimates, the rise time to maximum for SN 2014J\nis $\\sim 18$ days, which is consistent with those of normal SNe Ia.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig07_new.eps}}\n\\caption[]{\\footnotesize UVOIR bolometric light curve of SN 2014J plotted along with the bolometric light\ncurves of SN 2011fe, SN 2005cf and SN 2003du. The bolometric light curves were constructed as described in the text.}\n \\label{fig:bol_comp}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe bolometric light curves of SNe Ia are powered by the decay chain \n$^{56}$Ni $\\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Co $\\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe. A combination of three parameters - the mass of $^{56}$Ni\nsynthesized in the explosion ($M_{Ni}$), the total ejecta mass ($M_{ej}$) and the kinetic energy of the explosion ($E_k$)\ndetermines the peak luminosity and width of the bolometric light curve \\citep{Arnett82}. \n\nUsing Arnett's rule \\citep{Arnett82} to estimate the mass of $^{56}$Ni synthesized for a rise time $t_R \\sim 18$ days and\na peak bolometric flux $L_{bol}^{max} \\approx 1.06 \\times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we obtain \n$M_{Ni} \\approx 0.5$ M$_{\\odot}$, assuming $\\alpha = 1$. \n\n\nIn order to estimate the physical parameters of the explosion, i.e. $M_{Ni}$, $M_{ej}$ and $E_k$, we fit the observed\nbolometric light curve with a simple analytical model proposed by \\citet{Vinko04}. The assumptions in the model \ninclude spherical symmetry, homologous expansion of the ejecta and a constant opacity for $\\gamma$-rays and positrons.\nA core-shell density structure is assumed with a constant density core of fractional radius $x_0$, and an outer shell\nwith density decreasing outward as a power law with exponent $n$.\n\nThe free parameters in the model are ejected mass ($M_{ej}$), nickel mass ($M_{Ni}$), \n$\\gamma$-ray opacity ($\\kappa_{\\gamma}$), positron opacity ($\\kappa_{+}$), ejecta expansion velocity ($v_{exp}$) and the \ndensity power law exponent ($n$). \n\nFitting this model to the post-maximum part of the bolometric light curve until $188$ days since explosion,\nwe obtain the following best-fit parameter values for a fixed fractional core radius ($x_0 = 0.15$): \\\\\n$M_{ej} \\sim 1.3$ M$_{\\odot}$ (consistent with usual values of $0.9-1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$ for SNe Ia), \n$M_{Ni} \\sim 0.6$ M$_{\\odot}$, $\\kappa_{\\gamma} \\sim 0.03$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ (consistent with\nthe usual value of 0.027 cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$ for grey atmospheres), $\\kappa_{+} \\sim 0.04$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$, \n$v_{exp} \\sim 10\\,000$ km s$^{-1}$ (consistent with photospheric velocity of $\\sim 12\\,000$ km s$^{-1}$ deduced from spectra)\nand $n \\sim 0.9$. The kinetic energy of the explosion, $E_k \\sim 7 \\times 10^{50}$ erg. \\\\\n\nThe $^{56}$Ni mass estimated above is consistent with the estimates of \\citet{Churazov14}, \\citet{Marion15} and\n\\citet{Telesco15} for SN 2014J. \\citet{Childress15} estimate $M_{ej}$ and $M_{Ni}$ using [Co~{\\sc iii}] \n$\\lambda 5893$ emission feature in the nebular spectra of a sample of SNe Ia which includes SN 2014J. \nFor SN 2014J, the estimated values are $M_{ej} \\approx 1.44$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $M_{Ni} \\approx 0.84$ M$_{\\odot}$.\n\\citet{Scalzo14a} estimated $M_{ej}$ and $M_{Ni}$ for a sample of 19 normal SNe Ia by modelling their bolometric light\ncurves and obtained a distribution of $0.9 < M_{ej} < 1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $M_{Ni}(avg) \\sim 0.5$ M$_{\\odot}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig08_new.eps}}\n\\caption[]{\\footnotesize $UVOIR$ bolometric light curve of SN 2014J plotted along with the computed model\n\\citep{Vinko04} corresponding to the best-fit parameter values.}\n \\label{fig:bol}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Spectroscopy Results}\n\nOptical spectra of SN 2014J were obtained on 23 epochs between $-7.7$d to $+351.1$d relative to $B$-band maximum,\nwhereas NIR spectra were obtained on 4 epochs around $B$-band maximum.\nThe optical spectra of SN 2014J show a red continuum owing to the large amount of extinction suffered by the SN, but the \nspectral features are essentially those of a normal SN Ia.\n\n\\subsection{Spectral Evolution and SYN++ fits}\n\nThe photospheric phase spectra of SN 2014J show prominent features attributable to \nSi~{\\sc ii}, S~{\\sc ii}, Ca~{\\sc ii}, Fe~{\\sc ii} and Mg~{\\sc ii} \\citep[eg.][]{Goobar14}.\nThe similarity of the early spectra of SN 2014J to SN 2011fe\nhas been noted by \\citet{Zheng14,Goobar14,Marion15}. However, unlike SN 2011fe, SN 2014J shows the presence of\nhigh velocity features (HVFs) in pre-maximum spectra and lacks the C~{\\sc ii} $\\lambda 6580$ feature, which was detected\nin SN 2005cf and SN 2011fe \\citep{Zheng14,Goobar14}. \nThe lack of detection of C~{\\sc ii} in the optical spectra could be due to the rather late discovery of SN 2014J.\nThe earliest spectrum reported on January 22.3 UT \\citep{Goobar14} corresponds to a phase of $\\sim -9$d\nrelative to $B_{max}$. Detection of C~{\\sc ii} becomes difficult at this phase, since the ionized carbon layer begins to\ncool and recombine to form C~{\\sc i}. This does not rule out the presence of carbon in the spectra however, as pointed out by\n\\citet{Marion15}, who report the detection of the C~{\\sc i} 1.06 $\\mu m$ feature in their early NIR spectra from \n$-7.4$d to $+3.2$d. \\\\\n\nThe early spectral evolution of SN 2014J in the optical ($-7.7$d to $+25.2$d) and NIR ($-2.8$d to $+11.2$d) is shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:nearmax} and Figure~\\ref{fig:nirspec}, respectively.\nThe photospheric velocity of the ejecta, as measured from the blueshift of the Si~{\\sc ii} $\\lambda 6355$ absorption feature,\nevolves from $\\sim 13\\,300$ km s$^{-1}$ at $-7.7$d to $\\sim 12\\,000$ km s$^{-1}$ near $B_{max}$ and further falls\nto $\\sim 11\\,400$ km s$^{-1}$ at +17.0d, consistent with the measurements reported by \\citet{Marion15}.\nThis places SN 2014J at the border of the normal velocity (NV) group and high velocity (HV) group of SNe Ia \\citep{Wang09a}.\nOur earliest optical spectrum ($-7.7$d) shows HV features of Ca~{\\sc ii} detached at $\\sim 24\\,000$ km s$^{-1}$, but\nthis feature disappears rapidly as the epoch of $B$-band maximum approaches.\nThe earliest NIR spectrum presented here ($-2.8$d) exhibits a prominent Mg~{\\sc ii} 1.09 $\\mu m$ feature blueshifted at \n$\\sim 13\\,000$ km s$^{-1}$, whereas later NIR spectra are dominated by blended absorption due to\nMg~{\\sc ii} 1.68 $\\mu m$, Si~{\\sc ii} 1.69 $\\mu m$ features \\citep{Marion15}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig09_new.eps}}\n \\caption[]{\\footnotesize Early spectral evolution of SN 2014J between $-7.7$d to $+25.2$d.

The supernova reached $B$-band \nmaximum on JD 2456690.14, at an apparent magnitude $m_B(max) = 11.94$.\nThe optical spectra show a red continuum with deep interstellar Na~{\\sc i} absorption, but \notherwise resemble those of normal SNe Ia. The Si~{\\sc ii} $\\lambda 6355$ feature \nindicates a velocity of $\\sim 12\\,000$ km s$^{-1}$ at $B$-band maximum, which places \nSN 2014J at the border of the Normal Velocity and High Velocity group of SNe Ia.\nThe velocity evolution of SN 2014J places it in the Low Velocity Gradient \nsubclass, whereas the equivalent widths of Si~{\\sc ii} features near $B$-band \nmaximum place it at the border of the Core Normal and Broad Line subclasses of SNe \nIa.

SNe Ia are thought to be thermonuclear \ndisruptions of accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) in a close binary \nsystem \\citep{Hoyle60,Woosley86}. Plausible progenitor systems for SNe Ia include the single degenerate (SD) scenario\n\\citep{Whelan73} where the companion is a main sequence or giant star, and the double degenerate (DD) scenario \n\\citep{Iben84,Webbink84} wherein the companion is also a WD (see \\citealt{Maoz14} for a recent review).\nThe details of the explosion mechanism and the nature of the progenitor, however, still remain unclear.\nThe wealth of recent data on SNe Ia has revealed the inherent diversity within this class of objects. \nWhile the majority ($\\sim 70 \\%$) of SNe Ia fall under the ``normal'' category, sub-luminous 1991bg-like objects\nmake up $\\sim 18 \\%$, whereas over-luminous 1991T-like events and peculiar 2002cx-like events constitute the remaining\n$12 \\%$ \\citep{Li11}. \n\nThe uncertainty in the amount of extinction suffered by SNe Ia in their host galaxy environment is a significant\nobstacle in using them effectively as cosmological probes. Highly reddened SNe Ia tend to show unusually low values\nof $R_V \\lesssim 2$ \\citep{Nobili08,Phillips13}, eg. SN 1999cl \\citep{Krisciunas06}, SN2002cv \\citep{EliasRosa08},\nSN 2003cg \\citep{EliasRosa06} and 2006X \\citep{Wang08}; as opposed to the average Galactic value of $R_V = 3.1$. \nThe observational evidence suggests that SNe Ia generally exhibit very weak continuum \npolarization ($P \\lesssim 0.3$ per cent) but a moderate level of line polarization up to a few per cent \n\\citep[see,][and references therein]{Wang97p,Wang03p,Wang06p,Leonard05p,Chornock06p,Wang08p,Patat09p,Smith11p,Maund13p}.\nThe continuum and line polarization depend upon the geometry of explosion and distribution of matter around the \nSN, respectively \\citep{Wang08p}. Therefore, study of polarization properties can provide information on\nasymmetry and orientation and also shed light on the time-varying behaviour of the SN ejecta. \nGenerally, a significant level of line and continuum polarization tends \nto be detected in these events at early times (pre or near maximum light), decreasing at later epochs\n\\citep[although there are exceptions, for example see][]{Zelaya13p}.\n\nSN 2014J was serendipitously discovered by \\citet{Fossey14} on 2014 January 21, in the \nnearby galaxy M82. The discovery prompted an international multi-wavelength \nobservational effort, spanning radio to $\\gamma$-ray observations. At a distance of \nonly $\\sim 3.5$ Mpc, SN 2014J is among the nearest SNe Ia ever observed and thus \nprovides an excellent opportunity to study in detail the properties of the progenitor \nand the nature of absorbing  dust along the line of sight.\n\nPre-discovery observations were reported from the Katzman Automatic \nImaging Telescope (KAIT) as part of the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) by \n\\citet{Zheng14}, who also constrained the time of first-light between January 14.54 \nand 14.96 UT, with January 14.75 UT as the best estimate. Using high cadence \npre-explosion data obtained by the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT), \n\\citet{Goobar15} report an explosion date of January $14.54 \\pm 0.3$ UT, 5 hours \nearlier than that reported by \\citet{Zheng14}. \n\nSeveral detailed studies spanning a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum have been published on SN 2014J. \n\\citet{Goobar14} presented early optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations and noted the presence of high velocity\nfeatures of Si~{\\sc ii} and Ca~{\\sc ii} in the optical spectra and a best-fit value of $R_V = 1.4 \\pm 0.15$ to explain \nthe observations.\n\\citet{Amanullah14} presented ultraviolet (UV) to NIR photometry of SN 2014J up to $\\sim 40$ days past $B$-band maximum\nand inferred best-fit reddening parameter values of $E(B-V)_{true} \\sim 1.3$ and $R_V \\sim 1.4$ for a Galactic \nextinction law. The results of \\citet{Amanullah14} were also found to be consistent with power-law extinction which was\ninvoked by \\citet{Goobar08} to account for extinction caused by multiple scattering. \nUsing multi-band photometry spanning UV to NIR, \\citet{Foley14} reported similar reddening parameters of \n$E(B-V)_{true} \\sim 1.2$ and $R_V \\sim 1.4$. However, a two component model involving a typical dust component\n($R_V \\sim 2.5$) and a circumstellar scattering component provided a better fit to the data \\citep{Foley14}.\nFurther, \\citet{Gao15} used dust models comprising graphite and silicate components in order to model the color excess\ntoward SN 2014J and inferred $E(B-V)_{true} \\sim 1.1$ and $R_V \\sim 1.7$, consistent with the results of \\citet{Amanullah14}\nand \\citet{Foley14}.\nUsing \\emph{Swift}-UVOT data for SN 2014J, \\citet{Brown15} concurred with the low \nvalue of $R_V$ derived by previous authors, but argued for an interstellar origin for the extinction rather \nthan circumstellar. Although C~{\\sc ii} is not detected in the early optical spectra \\citep{Goobar14}, \n\\citet{Marion15} reported detection of\nthe C~{\\sc i} 1.0693 $\\mu m$ feature in their NIR spectra. \n\\citet{Jack15} presented a time series of high resolution spectra of SN 2014J and confirmed the presence of \ninterstellar medium (ISM) features and diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) in the spectra.\n\\citet{Kawabata14} and \\citet{Patat15} present linear polarimetric observations of SN 2014J, which highlight the peculiar\nproperties of dust in M82 and argue that the major contribution to extinction comes from interstellar dust rather than \ncircumstellar matter (CSM).\n\\citet{Crotts15} report detection of light echoes from SN 2014J, the most prominent ones originating at distances of 80 pc\nand 330 pc from the SN.\nAn early detection of $\\gamma$-ray lines from SN 2014J was reported by \\citet{Diehl14}, while subsequent observations\nof $\\gamma$-ray emission due to $^{56}$Co were presented by \\citet{Churazov14,Diehl15}.\n\nVarious lines of evidence seem to favor the DD progenitor scenario for SN 2014J.\nUsing pre-explosion archival \\emph{HST} images, \\citet{Kelly14} ruled out a bright red giant companion as the donor.\nThe non-detection of radio \\citep{Perez-Torres14} and X-ray emission \\citep{Margutti14} also rule out a majority of the\nparameter space occupied by SD models.\n\\citet{Lundqvist15} failed to find traces of accreted material from a non-degenerate companion in nebular spectra,\nstrengthening the case for the DD scenario for SN 2014J.\n\nWe present in this paper the results of extensive monitoring of SN 2014J in optical \nand NIR bands undertaken at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO) using the \n2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). Also presented are four epochs of broadband \npolarimetric observations obtained using the ARIES Imaging Polarimeter mounted at the \n1-m Sampurnanand Telescope (ST) at Manora Peak, Nainital.\n\n\\section{Observations and Reduction}\n\n\\subsection{Optical Photometry}\n\nPhotometric observations of SN 2014J commenced on 2014 January 24, $\\sim 8$ days before $B$-band maximum, using the \n2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope at the Indian Astronomical Observatory at Hanle, and continued till 2014 October 28.\nThe observations were made with the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC). The SITe CCD available\nwith the HFOSC has an imaging area of 2K $\\times$ 4K pixels, of which the central unvignetted 2K $\\times$ 2K area was used\nfor imaging. The field of view in imaging mode is 10 $\\times$ 10 arcmin$^2$, with an image scale of 0.296 \narcsec pixel$^{-1}$. The SN was imaged in the Bessell $UBVRI$ filters available with the HFOSC.\nLandolt standard field PG0918+029 \\citep{Landolt1992} was observed under photometric conditions on the nights of \n2014 January 30, February 24 and February 26 for photometric calibration of the supernova field.\n \nData reduction was performed in the standard manner using various packages available \nwith the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF\\footnote{IRAF is distributed by \nthe National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which are operated by the Association \nof Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the \nNational Science Foundation}). \nAperture photometry was performed on the standard stars at two apertures - an aperture close to the FWHM of the stellar\nprofile, and another aperture of around 4 times the FWHM of the stellar profile. Aperture corrections were calculated as\nthe difference in magnitude for the two apertures. Average aperture corrections were calculated using\nall the stars in the standard field.\n\n\nAverage extinction coefficients for the site \\citep{Stalin08} were used in order to\naccount for atmospheric extinction, and average values of the color terms for the \nHFOSC system were used to arrive at the photometric solutions. The solutions thus \nobtained were used to calibrate local standards in the supernova field, \nobserved on the same night as the standard fields. The local standards were thereafter\nused to calibrate the supernova magnitudes. The field for SN 2014J is shown in \nFigure~\\ref{fig:idchart}, and the magnitudes of the secondary standards are listed in \nTable~\\ref{tab:secstd}. \n\nThe magnitudes of the supernova and the secondary standards were evaluated using point-spread function (PSF)\nfitting, with a fitting radius close to the FWHM of the stellar profile. \nNightly photometric zero points were estimated using the local secondary standards and the supernova magnitudes were\nevaluated differentially.\n\nSince SN 2014J exploded in the interior of the bright starburst galaxy M82, there is \nsignificant contamination by the host galaxy in the late phase optical photometry. In \norder to subtract the host galaxy contribution, we used pre-explosion Sloan Digital \nSky Survey (SDSS) $ugriz$ images of M82 as templates. In order to transform the images\nfrom $ugriz$ to $BVRI$ filter system, we used the transformations prescribed by \nLupton (2005)\\footnote{\\url{https://www.sdss3.org/dr8/algorithms/sdssUBVRITransform.php#Lupton2005}}.\nThe transformed SDSS images were then used as templates for host galaxy subtraction. \\\\\nIn order to check the robustness of this method, we applied the template subtraction to images obtained\nnear the epoch of maximum brightness, where the host galaxy contamination is expected to be minimal.\nThe magnitudes obtained using template subtraction were seen to show excellent agreement with those obtained using\nPSF photometry near epochs of maximum brightness.\nThe magnitudes calculated using the above two methods indicate host galaxy contribution in the estimated SN\nmagnitudes beyond $\\sim 60$ days since $B$-band maximum. Hence, beyond this epoch, we use the template-subtracted magnitudes.\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:mag} summarizes the optical $UBVRI$ photometric observations and also\nlists the estimated magnitudes of SN 2014J.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{0.85\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig01_new.eps}}\n \\caption[]{\\footnotesize Identification chart for SN 2014J.

observations of SN 2014J were carried out in \\textit{J, H} and \n\\textit{K$_S$} bands using the TIFR Near Infrared Spectrometer and Imager (TIRSPEC) \nmounted on HCT. TIRSPEC's detector is $1024 \\times 1024$ Hawaii-1 PACE\\footnote{\nHgCdTe Astronomy Wide Area Infrared Imager -1, Producible Alternative to CdTe for \nEpitaxy} (HgCdTe) array. It has a pixel size of 18 $\\mu m$ and a field of view (FoV) of\n$\\sim$ $5 \\times 5$ arcmin$^{2}$. Broadband filters used for observations were $J$ ($\\lambda_{center}$= 1.25 $\\mu m$, \n$\\Delta\\lambda$= 0.16 $\\mu m$), $H$ ($\\lambda_{center}$= 1.635 $\\mu m$, $\\Delta\\lambda$= 0.29 $\\mu m$) and \n$K_S$ ($\\lambda_{center}$= 2.145 $\\mu m$, $\\Delta\\lambda$= 0.31 $\\mu m$) \n(Mauna Kea Observatories Near-Infrared filter system).\nFurther details of TIRSPEC are available in \\citet{Ninan14} and \\citet{Ojha12}. \nA total of 17 nights of NIR photometric observations were obtained between 2014 January 24 and \n2014 April 30 (Table~\\ref{tab:mag}).\n\nObservations were carried out by pointing the telescope at 5 dither positions with \n15\\arcsec\\, step size. For generating a master sky frame, a separate sky region was \nalso observed with same exposure and dither pattern immediately after each SN observation. A \ndark patch with no extended sources, 400\\arcsec north of SN 2014J was chosen as the sky region. \nData reduction was done using TIRSPEC photometry pipeline \\citep{Ninan14}. The \npipeline subtracts dark current for the equivalent exposure, and uses twilight flats \nof the same night for flat correction of data. Aperture photometry as well as PSF \nphotometry were found to have significant contamination from the non-uniform\nbackground of the host galaxy. Hence, 2MASS archive image of the galaxy was used as \ntemplate and the galaxy background image was subtracted before aperture photometry. \nFor aperture photometry, an aperture of 3 times FWHM was used. The uniform background \nsky was estimated from a ring outside the aperture radius with a width of 4.5\\arcsec. \n2MASS magnitudes of secondary standards in the field were used for magnitude calibration and color correction.\nTable~\\ref{tab:mag} summarizes the $JHK_s$ magnitudes of SN 2014J.\n\n\\subsection{Optical Spectroscopy}\n\nOptical spectroscopic observations of SN 2014J were made during 2014 January 24 to 2015 January 18, using grisms \nGr7 (3500-7800 \\AA) and Gr8 (5200-9250 \\AA) available with the HFOSC. The details of the spectroscopic observations are \nsummarized in Table~\\ref{tab:speclog}.\nLamp spectra of FeAr and FeNe were used for wavelength calibration. The spectra were extracted in the standard manner.\nNight sky emission lines $\\lambda5577$, $\\lambda6300$ and $\\lambda6363$ were used to check the wavelength calibration \nand spectra were shifted wherever necessary. Spectra of spectrophotometric standards were observed in order to deduce \ninstrumental response curves for flux calibration. For those nights where standard star observations were not available,\nthe response curves obtained during nearby nights were used. The flux calibrated spectra in grisms Gr7 and Gr8 were combined \nwith appropriate scaling to give a single spectrum, which was brought to an absolute flux scale using the broadband \n$UBVRI$ photometric magnitudes. The spectra were corrected for redshift of the host galaxy. The telluric lines have not \nbeen removed from the spectra.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n \\centering\n \\caption{Log of spectroscopic observations of SN 2014J}\n \\label{tab:speclog}\n \n \n \\begin{tabular}{c c c c}\n \\hline\n Date & JD & Phase$^*$ & Range \\\\\n (yyyy/mm/dd) & 245 6000+ & (days) & (\\AA) \\\\\n \\hline\n 2014/01/24 & 682.43 & $-$7.71 & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/01/25 & 683.49 & $-$6.65 & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/01/26 & 684.49 & $-$5.65   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/01/27 & 685.50 & $-$4.64  & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/01/28 & 686.24 & $-$3.90   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/01/29 & 687.36 & $-$2.78  & 3500-7800; 5200-9250; $YJHK$ \\\\\n 2014/01/31 & 689.37 & $-$0.77  & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/02/01 & 690.41 & +0.27   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250; $JK$ \\\\\n 2014/02/02 & 691.06 & +0.92   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/02/07 & 696.42 & +6.28   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/02/11 & 700.30 & +10.16   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250; $YJHK$ \\\\\n 2014/02/12 & 701.36 & +11.22   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250; $YJH$ \\\\\n 2014/02/18 & 707.09 & +16.95   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/02/26 & 715.32 & +25.18   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/03/05 & 722.28 & +32.14   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/03/13 & 730.25 & +40.11   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/03/18 & 735.24 & +45.10   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/03/28 & 745.46 & +55.32   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/04/03 & 751.23 & +61.09   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/04/30 & 778.16 & +88.02   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/07/05 & 844.17 & +154.03   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2014/10/28 & 959.46 & +269.32   & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n 2015/01/18 & 1041.24 & +351.09  & 3500-7800; 5200-9250 \\\\\n \n \\hline\n \\multicolumn{3}{l}{$^*$\\footnotesize{time since $B$-band max (JD 2456690.14)}}\n \\end{tabular}\n\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\subsection{NIR Spectroscopy}\n\nNIR spectroscopic monitoring of SN 2014J from 1.02 $\\mu m$ to 2.35 $\\mu m$ was carried out using TIRSPEC.\nSpectroscopic observations were carried out using 1.97\\arcsec\\, wide long slit with a resolution of R $\\sim$ 1200.\nComplete spectral range was covered in separate single order mode observations of $Y$, $J$, $H$ and $K$ orders.\nSource spectrum was taken at least in two dither positions along the slit.

On the first epoch, observations were obtained in the $VRI$ bands, but only in the $R$-band \nthereafter. The log of polarimetric observations is given in Table~\\ref{tab_log}.\n\nThe polarimeter consists of a half-wave plate (HWP) modulator and a Wollaston prism \nbeam-splitter. The Wollaston prism analyzer is placed at the backend of the telescope \nbeam path in order to produce ordinary and extraordinary beams in slightly different \ndirections separated by 28 pixels along the north-south direction on the sky plane. \nA focal reducer (85 mm, f/1.8) is placed between the Wollaston prism and the CCD \ncamera. The AIMPOL camera is composed of 1024 pixels $\\times$ 1024 pixels.\nEach pixel corresponds to 1.73 arcsec, and the FoV is $\\sim$8 arcmin \nin diameter on the sky. The FWHM of the stellar images varies from 2 to 3 pixels.\nAt each position of the half-wave plate (0$\\degr$, 22.5$\\degr$, 45$\\degr$ and 67.5$\\degr$),\nmultiple sets of frames were obtained. \n\nFluxes of ordinary ($I_{o}$) and extra-ordinary ($I_{e}$) beams of the SN were \nextracted by standard aperture photometry after pre-processing using {\\small IRAF}.\nThe detailed procedures used to estimate the polarization and polarization angles for \nthe target objects can be found in \\citet{Ramprakash98p} and \\citet{Rautela04p}.\n\nTo correct our measurements for the zero-point polarization angle, polarized standard\nstars \\citep[BD~59389, HD~19820, HD~155197, HD~25443, HD~16056, HD~154445 and \nHD~25443; from][]{Schmidt92p} were observed on each night. The difference between the \nobserved and standard values were applied to the SN. The instrumental \npolarization of AIMPOL on the 104 cm ST has been characterized for different projects \nand generally found to be $\\sim$0.1 per cent \\citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{Rautela04p,Pandey09p,Eswaraiah11p,Eswaraiah12p,Kumar14p}.\nThe SN polarization has been calibrated by applying this offset value. The estimated \nSN polarization parameters are listed in Table~\\ref{tab_log}. \n\n\\section{Optical and NIR Light Curves}\\label{lc}\n\nSN 2014J was observed in the $UBVRI$ bands from $-8$d to $+269$d, and in the NIR \n$JHK_s$ bands from $-8$d to $+88$d since $B$-band maximum, which occurred on \nJD $2456690.14 \\pm 0.5$ at an apparent magnitude of $11.94 \\pm 0.02$.\nThe optical and NIR light curves of SN 2014J are shown in Figures~\\ref{fig:lc_ubvri} and ~\\ref{fig:lc_jhk},\nrespectively. The photometric properties of SN 2014J extracted from the light curves are summarized in \nTable~\\ref{tab:phot_prop}.\n\nSN 2014J suffers an unusually large amount of extinction in its host environment.\nIn addition to a single component dust model with low $R_V$, \\citet{Foley14} had also invoked a\ntwo component dust model which consists of a typical dust component along with a Large Magellanic Cloud-like dust\ncomponent in the circumstellar environment of SN 2014J in order to explain the observations.\nHowever, polarization studies seem to rule out the presence of a CSM \\citep{Kawabata14,Patat15}.\n\\citet{Brown15} also attribute most of the observed extinction to dust of interstellar rather than circumstellar origin.\nThus, in order to account for host extinction, we favor the single dust component model with\n$E(B-V)_{true} = 1.24 \\pm 0.10$ and $R_V = 1.44 \\pm 0.06$ \\citep{Foley14} for a standard CCM reddening\nlaw \\citep{Cardelli89}, as modified by \\citet{ODonnell94}. \n\nThe observed decline rate parameter, $\\Delta m_{15}(B)_{obs} = 0.96 \\pm 0.03$. However, the large amount of \nreddening effectively shifts the wavelength being sampled towards the red.
