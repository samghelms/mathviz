[{"file": "1601.02209.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $V_{*}$ is the stellar visibility (e.g.~\\citealt{Kreplin:2012}).\nHere, we assume $V_{*}=1$ since the central star is unresolved (its\nangular radius is $\\sim$0.07~mas at the distance of 318~pc, \nVL07). To estimate the ratio of the circumstellar\nto stellar fluxes, we compare the stellar atmosphere model of \\citet{Kurucz:1979}\nwith $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=10500\\,$K and $\\log g_{*}=3.5$ (\\citealt{Montesinos:2009}) with the K-band\nphotometry data from VO SED Analyzer tool (VOSA, \\citealt{Bayo:2008}),\nafter dereddening the data ($A_{V}=0.4$ , \\citealt{Malfait:1998}). \nThe original photometric data are from\n\\citet*{Ochsenbein:2000}. The target distance ($d\\sim318$~pc, VL07) \nis adopted from the \\textit{Hipparcos} measurement. We find the flux\nratio is $F_{\\mathrm{circ}}/F_{*}=2.9$ \nat $\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}=}2.2\\,\\micron$. Using this value and\nequation~\\ref{eq:vis-circumstellar}, the circumstellar visibilities\n$V_{\\mathrm{circ}}$ are determined for each set of the LR VLTI-AMBER\nobservations (Table~\\ref{tab:obs-log-low-res}). The results are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ring-fit}.  The figure suggests that the emission\ngeometry deviates from a spherical symmetry because e.g.~the\ncircumstellar visibilities at the spatial frequency $\\sim30\\times 10^{6}\\,\\lambda$\n(e.g. in the data sets~C and D) are notably different for the\nbaselines with different position angles. \n\nTo model the circumstellar visibilities $V_{\\mathrm{circ}}$, we\nconsider an inclined uniform ring geometry with an inner radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ and a width $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ because the\nK-band continuum of the discs of Herbig stars is expected to originate\nmainly from the region near the dust sublimation radius (e.g.~MO05;\n\\citealt{Dullemond:2010}).  Here, we assume $\\Delta\nR_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.2\\, R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ as in MO05. The elongation\nof the ring occurs when the circular ring has an inclination angle\n$i>0^{\\circ}$.  We use this two-dimensional model to fit the set of\nall visibilities from the LR observations simultaneously, instead\nof fitting one-dimensional model visibilities to individual observed\nvisibilities.  The results of the best-fit model are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ring-fit}. The corresponding model parameters are\nsummarised in Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param}. As one can see from the\nfigure, the simple geometrical model with a ring can reasonably fit\nthe observed visibilities. In this analysis, we find that the angular\nradius of the K-band continuum-emitting ring is around 2.0~mas\n(Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param}), which corresponds to 0.64~au at the\ndistance of 318~pc (VL07).\n\n\n\\section{Radiative Transfer Models}\n\n\\label{sec:RT-models}\n\n\nTo model the interferometric quantities obtained by VLTI-AMBER in\nthe high-spectral-resolution mode, i.e.~the wavelength-dependent flux,\nvisibility and differential and closure phases around Br$\\gamma$\npresented in Section~\\ref{sec:observations}, we use the radiative\ntransfer code {\\sc torus} (e.g.~\\citealt{Harries:2000, Symington:2005,\n  Kurosawa:2006}; KU11).  The numerical method used in the\ncurrent work is\nessentially the same as in KU11. The model uses the\ntree-structured grid (octree/quadtree in 3-D and 2-D, respectively) in\ncartesian coordinate, but here we assume axisymmetry around the\nstellar rotation axis.  The atomic model consists of hydrogen with 20\nenergy levels, and the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE)\nlevel populations are solved using the Sobolev approximation\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Sobolev:1957,castor:1970,castor:1979}. More\ncomprehensive descriptions of the code are given in KU11.\n\nFor the present work, we have made three minor modifications to the code\nin KU11: (1)~the model now includes the continuum\nemission from a geometrically flat ring which simulates the K-band dust\nemission near the dust sublimation radius, (2)~the effect of rotation\nof a magnetosphere has been included by using the method described in\n\\cite*{Muzerolle:2001}, and (3)~the code has been modified to write\nmodel intensity maps as a function of wavelength (or velocity\nbins). The first modification is important for modelling a correct\nline strength of Br$\\gamma$ (2.2166~$\\mu$m) and the interferometric\nquantities around the line. The second modification is included\nbecause intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars are expected to be\nrotating relatively fast with their rotation periods about $0.2$ to a few\ndays (e.g.~\\citealt{Hubrig:2009}, but see also\n\\citealt{Hubrig:2011}). Until now,\nour model has been applied mainly to classical T Tauri stars which\nrotate relatively slowly with their rotation period 2--10\\,d\n(e.g.~\\citealt{Herbst:1987}; \\citealt{Herbst:1994}) in which  the effect\nof rotation is rather small (e.g.~\\citealt{Muzerolle:2001}). The\nthird modification is important because it will allow us to compute\nthe interferometric quantities, \nsuch as visibility, differential and closure phases, as a function of\nwavelength. This enables us to directly compare our models with the\nspectro-interferometric data from VLTI-AMBER.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Model configurations }\n\\label{sub:model-config}\n\n\nThere are 4 distinct emission components in our model: (1)~the central\nstar, (2)~the magnetospheric accretion funnels as described by\n\\citet*{Hartmann:1994} and \\citet{Muzerolle:2001}, (3)~the disc wind\nwhich emerges from the equatorial plane (a geometrically thin\naccretion disc) located outside of the magnetosphere and (4)~the\ngeometrically flat ring which simulates the K-band dust emission near\nthe dust sublimation radius.  A basic schematic diagram of our models\nis shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:model-config}.  In the following, we\nbriefly describe each component and the key parameters. More\ncomprehensive descriptions of the magnetosphere and disc wind\ncomponents can be found in KU11.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig04.pdf}\n\n\n\\caption{The model configuration of the circumstellar materials around\n  the Herbig Be star HD~58647.  The density is assumed\n  to be axisymmetric and top-down symmetric. The model consists\n  of: (1)~the stellar continuum source (star) located at the origin of \n  the cartesian coordinates system ($w$,$z$), (2)~the magnetospheric accretion\n  flow, (3)~the disc wind, (4)~the K-band continuum-emitting ring, \n  and (5)~the geometrically thin accretion disc. The split-monopole (with the source\n  displacement distance $D$) disc wind emerges from the equatorial\n  plane, but only within the distances from $z$-axis between\n  $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$. The geometrically thin ring\n  with its inner radius $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ and width $\\Delta\n  R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ is also placed on\n  the equatorial plane. See Section~\\ref{sub:model-config} for more\n  information.  The figure is not to scale. \\label{fig:model-config} }\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Central star}\n\n\\label{subsub:Central-star}\n\nThe central star is the main source of continuum radiation which ionizes the\ngas in the flow components (a magnetospheric accretion and a disc\nwind).  For a given effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and its\nsurface gravity $\\log g_*$, we use the stellar atmosphere model of\n\\citet{Kurucz:1979} as the photospheric contribution to the \ncontinuum in our model.  Our underlying central star is a late B-type star;\nhence, the photospheric absorption component from the star may affect\nthe shape of the model Br$\\gamma$ profiles. For this reason, we use\nthe high-spectral-resolution synthetic \\textsc{phoenix}\n(\\citealt{Hauschildt:1999}) spectra from \\citet{Husser:2013},\nconvolved with $v\\sin i=118\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ (\\citealt{Mora:2001}) for the\nphotospheric absorption profile for Br$\\gamma$. \n\n\\subsubsection{Magnetosphere }\n\n\\label{subsub:MA-config}\n\nWe adopt a dipole magnetic field geometry with its accretion\nstream described by $r=R_{\\mathrm{m}}\\,\\sin^{2}{\\theta}$ where $r$ and\n$\\theta$ are the polar coordinates; $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the\nmagnetospheric radius on the equatorial plane, as in\ne.g.~\\cite{ghosh:1977} and \\cite{Hartmann:1994}. In this model, the\naccretion occurs in the funnel regions defined by two stream lines\nwhich correspond to the inner and outer magnetospheric radii, i.e.,\n$R_{\\mathrm{m}}=R_{\\mathrm{mi}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:model-config}).  As in KU11, we follow\nthe density and temperature structures along the stream lines as in\n~\\citet{Hartmann:1994} and \\cite{Muzerolle:2001}. The temperature\nscale is normalised with a parameter $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ which sets the\nmaximum temperature in the stream. The mass-accretion rate\n$\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ scales the density of the magnetospheric\naccretion funnels. We adopt the method described in \n\\cite{Muzerolle:2001} (their Appendix A), to include the effect of rotation in the\naccretion funnels.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Disc wind}\n\n\\label{subsub:DW-config}\n\n\n\n\nAs in KU11, the disc wind model used here is based on\nthe `split-monopole' wind model by e.g.~\\citet{knigge:1995} and\n\\citet{Long:2002} (see also \\citealt{Shlosman:1993}). The outflow\narises from the surface of the rotating accretion disc, and has a\nbi-conical geometry.  Most influential parameters in our models are:\n(1)~the total mass-loss rate in the disc wind ($\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$),\n(2)~the degree of the wind collimation, (3)~the steepness of the\nradial velocity ($\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ in\nequation~\\ref{eq:discwind-poloidal-velocity} below), and \n(4)~the wind temperature. Fig.~\\ref{fig:model-config} shows the basic\nconfiguration of the disc-wind model. The wind arises from the disc\nsurface. The wind ``source'' points ($S$), from which the stream lines\ndiverge, are placed at distance $D$ above and below the centre of the\nstar. The angle of the wind launching is controlled by changing the\nvalue of $D$. The wind launching is confined between $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$\nand $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$ where the former is normally set to the outer\nradius of the closed magnetosphere ($R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$) and the latter\nto be a free parameter.  The wind density is normalised with the total\nmass-loss rate in the disc wind ($\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$) while the\nlocal mass-loss rate per unit area ($\\dot{m}$) follows the power-law\n$\\dot{m} \\propto w^{-p}$ where $w$ is the distance from the star on the\nequatorial plane and $p=2.4$ (our fiducial value which produces\nreasonable Br$\\gamma$ line profiles). \n\nThe poloidal component of the wind velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{p}}$) is parametrised as: \n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 21009, "prevtext": "\n\n\\label{firstpage} \n\\pagerange{\\pageref{firstpage}--\\pageref{lastpage}}\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nWe present a study of the wind launching region of the Herbig Be star\nHD~58647 using high angular ($\\lambda/2B=0''.003$) and high spectral ($R=12000$) resolution\ninterferometric VLTI-AMBER observations of the near-infrared hydrogen emission\nline, Br$\\gamma$.  The star displays double peaks in both\nBr$\\gamma$ line profile and wavelength-dependent visibilities. The\nwavelength-dependent differential phases show \nS-shaped variations around the line centre. The visibility level\nincreases in the line (by $\\sim 0.1$) at the longest projected baseline\n(88\\,m), indicating that the size of the line emission region is\nsmaller than the size of the K-band continuum-emitting region,\nwhich is expected to arise near the dust sublimation radius of the\naccretion disc. The data have been analysed using radiative transfer\nmodels to probe the geometry, size and physical properties of the wind\nthat is emitting Br$\\gamma$.  We find that a model with a small\nmagnetosphere and a disc wind with its inner radius located just\noutside of the magnetosphere can well reproduce the observed\nBr$\\gamma$ profile, wavelength-dependent visibilities, differential\nand closure phases, simultaneously. The mass-accretion and mass-loss\nrates adopted for the model are $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}=3.5\\times10^{-7}$ and\n$\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}=4.5\\times10^{-8}\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$, respectively \n($\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}/\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}=0.13$).  \nConsequently, about 60~per~cent of the angular momentum loss\nrate required for a steady accretion with the measured\naccretion rate is provide by the disc wind.\nThe small magnetosphere in HD~58647 does not contribute to the\nBr$\\gamma$ line emission significantly.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords} stars: individual: HD~58647, stars: pre-main sequence,\nstars: winds, outflows, circumstellar matter, line profiles, radiative\ntransfer \\end{keywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\n\\caption{Summary of known properties of HD\\,58647. \\label{tab:published-parameters}}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccccccc}\n\\hline \n$M_{*}$ & $R_{*}$ & $L_{*}$ & Sp.

They are likely responsible for transporting excess\nangular momentum away from the star-disc system and regulating the\nmass-accretion process and spin evolution of newly born stars\n(e.g.~\\citealt{hartmann:1989}; \\citealt{matt:2005};\n\\citealt{Bouvier:2014}). There are at least three possible types of\noutflows around young stellar objects: (1)~a disc wind launched from\nthe accretion disc (e.g.~\\citealt{blandford:1982};\n\\citealt{ustyugova:1995}; \\citealt{Romanova:1997};\n\\citealt{ouyed:1997}; \\citealt{Ustyugova:1999};\n\\citealt{koenigl:2000}; \\citealt{Pudritz:2007}), (2)~an X-wind or a\nconical wind launched near  \nthe disc-magnetosphere interaction region\n(e.g.~\\citealt{shu:1994,Shu:1995}; \\citealt{Romanova:2009}) and (3) a\nstellar wind launched from open magnetic field lines anchored to the\nstellar surface (e.g.~\\citealt{decampli:1981};\n\\citealt*{hartmann:1982}; \\citealt{Kwan:1988}; \\citealt{Hirose:1997};\n\\citealt{Strafella:1998}; \\citealt{Romanova:2005};\n\\citealt{matt:2005}; \\citealt{Cranmer:2009}).  However, despite recent\nefforts, the exact launching mechanisms of the winds and outflows as\nwell as the mechanism behind the collimation of the ejected gas into\njets are still not well understood (e.g.~\\citealt{Edwards:2006};\n\\citealt*{Ferreira:2006}; \\citealt*{Kwan:2007};\n\\citealt{Tatulli:2007b}; \\citealt{Kraus:2008}; \n\\citealt*{Eisner:2014}). Hence, high-resolution interferometric\nobservations which can resolve the wind launching regions are crucial\nfor addressing this issue. If a high spectral resolution is combined\nwith a high spatial resolution, the emission-line regions near the\nbase of the wind (e.g., Br$\\gamma$ emission regions in Herbig Ae/Be\nstars) can be resolved in many spectral channels across the line\n(e.g.~\\citealt{Weigelt:2011,Kraus:2012,Kraus:2012b,GarciaLopez:2015}). This allows\nus to study the wavelength-dependent extent and the kinematics of the\nwinds, which can be derived from the line visibilities and\nwavelength-dependent differential and closure phases. Such\nobservations would help us to distinguish the different types of\noutflow scenarios.\n\n\nHD~58647 is a bright (K=5.4, H=6.1) Herbig Be star (B9 IV:\n\\citealt*{The:1994}; \\citealt*{Malfait:1998}; \\citealt{Mora:2001}) which\nis located at 318\\,pc (\\citealt{VanLeeuwen:2007}; hereafter VL07).\nThe star exhibits double-peaked profiles in some hydrogen emission\nlines, such as H$\\alpha$ and Br$\\gamma$ (e.g.~\\citealt{Grady:1996};\n\\citealt{Oudmaijer:1999}; \\citealt{Harrington:2009};\n\\citealt{Brittain:2007}). The star does not show a significant\nvariability in H$\\alpha$ on time scales of 3\\,d\n(\\citealt{Mendigutia:2011}) and 1\\,yr (\\citealt{Harrington:2009}). A\npresence of an intrinsic linear polarization in H$\\alpha$ is reported\nin \\citet{Vink:2002}, \\citet{Mottram:2007} and\n\\citet{Harrington:2009}.  A relatively strong double-peaked Br$\\gamma$\nis reported in \\citet{Brittain:2007}; however, no variability\nstudy is found for this line in the literature.  The age of the star has been\nestimated as 0.4\\,Myr (\\citealt*{VanDenAncker:1998}) and 0.16~Myr\n(\\citealt{Montesinos:2009}), but some have also reported the\npossibilities of the star being an older classical Be star\n(e.g.~\\citealt*{Manoj:2002}; \\citealt{Berthoud:2007}).\nUsing the broad K-band (2.18\\,$\\micron$, $\\Delta \\lambda=0.3\\,\\micron$) Keck\ninterferometer and a uniform ring geometric model, \\citet{Monnier:2005}\n(hereafter MO05)\nestimated the ring radius of the K-band continuum emission of HD~58647 as\n0.82($\\pm0.13$)\\,au, assuming the distance to the star is 280~pc\n(\\citealt{VanDenAncker:1998}; \\citealt{Perryman:1997}). However, this\nradius may be underestimated since the ring inclination effect is not\nincluded in their study.  Some of the known properties of HD~58647 are\nsummarised in Table~\\ref{tab:published-parameters}.\n\n\n\n   \n\nHere, we present VLTI-AMBER observations of the Herbig Be star\nHD~58647 with the high spectral resolution mode\n(HR-K-2.172) to resolve its Br$\\gamma$ emission spatially and\nspectrally ($\\mathrm{R}\\approx12000$, $\\Delta v\\approx25\\,\\mathrm{km\\,\n  s^{-1}}$). The velocity extent of the Br$\\gamma$ line profile for\nthe star is about $\\pm200\\,\\mathrm{km\\, s^{-1}}$\n(\\citealt{Brittain:2007}); hence, this \nresolution will provide us with more than 16 velocity components\nacross the line, which is essential for studying wind kinematics in a\nsubsequent radiative transfer modelling.  \nSo far, there are only a few Herbig stars which are observed with the\nVLTI-AMBER in the high spectral resolution mode: \nZ~CMa (Be + FUor, \\citealt{Benisty:2010}), \nMWC~297 (B1.5\\,V, \\citealt{Weigelt:2011}), \nHD~163296 (A1\\,V, \\citealt{GarciaLopez:2015}), HD~98922 (B9\\,V,\n\\citealt{Caratti:2015}) and HD~100564 (B9\\,V,\n\\citealt{Mendigutia:2015}). \\citet{Kraus:2012b} and \n\\citet{Ellerbroek:2015} have presented high spectral resolution\nVLTI-AMBER observations of V921 Sco (B[e]) and HD~50138 (B[e]),\nrespectively, but their evolutionary states are not well known. \nThese studies have  successfully demonstrated the\nfeasibility and usefulness of this type \nof observation for probing the kinematics and origin of the wind from\nHerbig stars. One notable difference between HD~58647 and other\nobjects (MWC~297, HD~163296 and HD~98922) is the shape of  Br$\\gamma$. The\nformer has a double-peaked and the latter have a single-peaked shaped\nline profile.  It is interesting to study whether the\ndifference is caused simply by the inclination angle effect or due to\na fundamental difference in their wind structures. For example, the\nBr$\\gamma$ emission could originate from a bipolar/stellar wind or \na disc wind (e.g.~\\citealt{Malbet:2007}; \\citealt{Tatulli:2007b};\n\\citealt{Kraus:2008}; \\citealt{Eisner:2010}; \\citealt{Weigelt:2011}).\nIf the line is double-peaked, the emission is most likely  from \na disc wind, which is rotating near Keplerian velocity at the base of\nthe wind. If the line is single-peaked, it is likely formed in either \na bipolar/stellar wind viewed at a mid to high inclination angle or a disc\nwind viewed at a low inclination angle (e.g.\\,\\citealt{Kurosawa:2006}). \n\nThe interferometric data will be analysed by using the radiative\ntransfer code \\textsc{torus} (e.g., \n\\citealt{Harries:2000}; \\citealt*{Symington:2005};\n  \\citealt*{Kurosawa:2006}; \\citealt*{Kurosawa:2011}, hereafter KU11;\n  \\citealt{Haworth:2012}), which calculates \nhydrogen emission line profiles and line intensity maps using various\ninflow/outflow models of young stars. The code has been used to study\nclassical T~Tauri stars (\\citealt*{Kurosawa:2005};\n\\citealt*{Kurosawa:2008};\n\\citealt{Kurosawa:2012,Alencar:2012,Kurosawa:2013}), a pre-FUor\n(\\citealt{Petrov:2014}) and a Herbig Ae star\n(\\citealt{GarciaLopez:2016}) in the past.  Based on the simulated\nemission maps computed in many velocity bins, we can reconstruct not\nonly the line profiles, but also important interferometric quantities\nsuch as visibility, differential and closure phases across the line,\nwhich can be directly compared with the observations. To differentiate\nvarious possible outflow scenarios (e.g., a stellar wind and a disc\nwind), we will perform qualitative analysis of wind structures around\nYSOs by detailed radiative transfer models for the high resolution\nspectro-interferometric observations.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this paper is to investigate the nature and the origin of\nthe wind around the Herbig Be star HD~58647 by means of high\nspectral resolution interferometric observations combined with\nradiative transfer modellings.  In Section~\\ref{sec:observations}, we\ndescribe our VLTI-AMBER observations and data reduction. A simple\ngeometrical model to characterise the size of continuum emission \nis presented in Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}. The description of\nthe radiative transfer models and the results of model fits to the\nobservations are given in Section~\\ref{sec:RT-models}. Brief\ndiscussions on our results are given in\nSection~\\ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, the summary of our findings and\nconclusions are presented in Section~\\ref{sec:conclusions}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.40\\textwidth]{fig01.pdf}\n\n\n\\caption{Summary of the high-spectral-resolution AMBER observations around Br$\\gamma$ using three\n  baselines.

The combination of UT2-UT3-UT4 telescopes\nalong with the high spectral resolution mode (R=12000) of AMBER were\nused. The log of the observations is summarised in\nTable~\\ref{tab:obs-log-high-res}. The interferograms were obtained\nusing the fringe tracker FINITO for co-phasing with the detector\nintegration time (DIT) of 0.75~s for each interferogram.  The total of\n2400 interferograms were recorded, or equivalently about 30 min of\ntotal integration time was used. In addition to our target, HD~57939\n(K0~III) was observed with the same DIT, as an interferometric\ncalibrator.\n\nThe fringe tracking performance typically varies between the target\nand calibrator observations; therefore, low-resolution (LR, R\n$\\approx$ 35) AMBER observations (ESO Prog. ID: 084.C-0170 and\n086.C-0267, PI: Natta) are used to calibrate the continuum\nvisibilities. A summary of the LR observations is shown in \nTable~\\ref{tab:obs-log-low-res}.  The data were reduced with\nthe AMBER data processing software \\textsc{amdlib} (v3.0.5)\n(\\citealt{Tatulli:2007a}; \\citealt*{Chelli:2009}), which is available\nat \\url{http://www.jmmc.fr/data_processing_amber.htm}.\nFurthermore, for the reduction of the LR data, we applied a  \nsoftware that equalizes the optical path difference\n(OPD) histograms of the object and calibrator (\\citealt{Kreplin:2012}).\nThe end products of the data reduction\nprocess are the wavelength-dependent normalised flux (averaged over 3\ntelescopes), visibilities, differential phases, and closure\nphases. The typical errors in the observed visibilities are\napproximately 5 to 9~per~cent. The results are summarised in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.46\\textwidth]{fig02.pdf}\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\caption{The $uv$ points used for  \n  the low-spectral-resolution (filled circle,\n  Tabel~\\ref{tab:obs-log-low-res}) and high-spectral-resolution\n  (filled diamond, Tabel~\\ref{tab:obs-log-high-res}) AMBER\n  observations are overplotted with the visibility from a geometrical\n  ring model.

The dip is located at\nthe line centre. The double-peaked line profiles are likely caused by\nthe rotation of the gas around the star, most likely in a disc wind\n(e.g.~\\citealt{Shlosman:1993,\n  knigge:1995,sim:2005b,Kurosawa:2006}). This will be further\ninvestigated in Section~\\ref{sec:RT-models}. The wavelength-dependent\nvisibilities are rather noisy, but those from the longest projected\nbaseline (87.9~m) clearly show that the visibility level increases\nin the line. The visibility curve also shows a double-peak appearance. The\nnoise levels in the visibility curves from the shorter \nbaselines (45.4 and 62.2~m) are somewhat higher; therefore, the\ndouble-peak feature is only weakly suggested. The increases of the\nvisibilities in the emission line with respect to those in the\ncontinuum indicate that the size of line-emitting region is smaller\nthan that of the K-band continuum-emitting region.\n\nThe wavelength-dependent differential phases show S-shape curves\naround the line centre for two projected baselines (45.4 and 87.9~m).\nIn both cases, the differential phase crosses 0 near the line\ncentre.  The sense of the S-shape pattern is opposite between the\ntwo. The deviation of the differential phases from $0^{\\circ}$\nindicates a shift in the photocentre at the velocity channel. Since\nthe pattern of the differential phase curves is sensitive to the\nkinematics and geometry of the line-emitting gas, this will be used to\nconstrain the gas outflow models used in the radiative transfer\ncalculations which are to be presented later in\nSection~\\ref{sub:model-vis}. Lastly, the wavelength-dependent closure\nphases do not show any significant deviation from $0^{\\circ}$ within\nthe range of uncertainties which are typically around $\\pm20^{\\circ}$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\n\\caption{Parameters of the best-fit geometrical ring model for\n  the low-resolution AMBER visibilities. \n  \\label{tab:ring-fit-param}}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccc}\n\\hline \nModel & $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ &$i$ & PA \\tabularnewline\n      & (mas) & ($^{\\circ}$) & ($^{\\circ}$)\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \nRing  & $2.0(\\pm 0.3)$ &$55(\\pm 2)$ & $105(\\pm 4)$\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\\section{A simple geometrical model for the continuum emission region}\n\n\\label{sec:ring-model-fit}\n\nTo estimate the characteristic size of the K-band continuum emission\nof HD~58647, we fit the observed visibilities of the LR VLTI-AMBER\nobservations, listed in Table~\\ref{tab:obs-log-low-res}, with a simple\ngeometrical ring model.

This is the same geometrical model used\nto fit the continuum visibilities in\nSection~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}.  Again, we assume  \n$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.2\\, R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$, as in MO05. The\nring is assumed to have a uniform temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{ring}}=1500\\,{\\mathrm{K}}$, and to radiate as a blackbody. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Modelling Br$\\gamma$ line profiles}\n\n\\label{sub:model-line-prof}\n\n\nSince computing the wavelength/velocity-dependent image maps is\n rather computationally expensive, we first concentrate on modelling\nthe Br$\\gamma$ profile (top panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary})\nobtained with the AMBER instrument to find a reasonable set of model parameters \nwhich approximately matches the observed line profile. Then, we will\nexpand the model constraints to the rest of the observed\ninterferometric quantities (visibilities, differential and closure\nphases) to further refine the model fit by computing the\nwavelength/velocity-dependent image maps for each model\n(Section~\\ref{sub:model-vis}).    \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Adopted stellar parameters}\n\n\\label{subsub:adopted-param}\n\nThe basic stellar parameters adopted for modelling the observed AMBER\ndata of our target HD~58647 are summarised in\nTable~\\ref{tab:stellar-param}.  We estimated the stellar luminosity\n$L_*$ by fitting the SED of HD~58647 using the VOSA online SED\nanalyzing tool (\\citealt{Bayo:2008}) using \n$T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=10500$~K and $\\log g_{*}=3.5$ (cgs)\n(\\citealt{Montesinos:2009}), the extinction $A_{V}=0.4$\n(\\citealt{Malfait:1998}) and the distance $d=318$\\,pc\n(VL07).  From this fit, we find\n$L_{*}=412\\,{\\mathrm{L_{\\sun}}}$.  Using the evolutionary tracks of pre-main\nsequence stars by \\citet*{Siess:2000} with the stellar luminosity found\nabove and $\\log g_{*}=3.5$, the stellar mass and radius of HD~58647\nare estimated as $M_{*}=4.6\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}}}$ and $R_{*}=6.2\\,{\\mathrm{R_{\\sun}}}$,\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe inclination angle $i$ of the K-band continuum-emitting ring was\nestimated as $i\\approx55^{\\circ}$ in Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}\n(Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param})  \nby fitting the continuum visibilities. Assuming the disc/ring normal vector coincides with the\nrotation axis of HD~58647 and the speed at which the star rotates at\nthe equator ($v_{\\mathrm{eq}}$) is same as $v$ in $v\\sin i$, we obtain\n$v_{\\mathrm{eq}}=144\\,\\mathrm{km\\, s^{-1}}$ (approximately $0.34$ of\nthe breakup velocity) using $v\\sin i=118\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$\n(\\citealt{Mora:2001}). Consequently, the rotation period of HD~58647\nis estimated as $P_{*}=2\\pi R_{*}/v_{\\mathrm{eq}}=2.2$~d.  We adopt\nthe mass-accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}=3.5\\times\n10^{-7}\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$ (\\citealt{Brittain:2007}), which is estimated\nfrom the CO line luminosity, in our magnetospheric accretion model.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\n\\caption{Adopted parameters of HD\\,58647 models. \\label{tab:stellar-param} }\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\n\\hline \n$R_{*}$  & $M_{*}$  & $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$  & $P_{*}$ & $d$  & $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ & $i$\\tabularnewline\n(${\\mathrm{R_{\\sun}}}$)  & (${\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}}}$)  & ($\\mathrm{K}$)  & (d) & ($\\mathrm{pc}$)  & (${\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$) & ($^{\\circ}$)\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n$6.2$  & $4.6$  & $10500$  & $2.2$ & $318$  & $3.5\\times10^{-7}$ & $55$\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\n\\caption{Main model parameters. \\label{tab:model-param}}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccccccccc}\n\\hline \n & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{Magnetosphere} &  & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Disc\n  wind} &  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Continuum Ring}\\tabularnewline\n\\cline{2-4} \\cline{6-11} \\cline{13-14} \n & $R_{\\mathrm{mi}}$ & $R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$ & $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ &  & $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ & $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ & $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$ & $D$ & $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ & $\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ &  & $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ & $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$\\tabularnewline\nModel  & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($\\mathrm{K}$)  &  & (${\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($\\mathrm{K}$) & $\\cdots$ &  & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$)\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \nA & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $7500$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$\\tabularnewline\nB & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8000$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$\\tabularnewline\nC & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8500$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$\\tabularnewline\nD & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8000$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $23.5$ & $0.2$\\tabularnewline\nE & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $4.5\\times10^{-8}$ & $1.7$ & $23.5$ & $100$ & $10^{4}$ & $2.0$ &  & $23.5$ & $0.2$\\tabularnewline\nF & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8000$ &  & $4.5\\times10^{-8}$ & $1.7$ & $23.5$ & $100$ & $10^{4}$ & $2.0$ &  & $23.5$ & $0.2$\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Br$\\gamma$ profiles from magnetospheric accretion models}\n\n\\label{subsub:line-MA-model}\n\nHere, we briefly examine the effect of magnetospheric accretion\n(Section~\\ref{subsub:MA-config}) on the formation of the hydrogen\nrecombination line Br$\\gamma$.  Using the stellar\nparameters above, the corotation radius ($R_{\\mathrm{cr}}$) of\nHD~58647 is estimated as \n$R_{\\mathrm{cr}}=\\left(GM_{*}\\right)^{1/3}\\left(P_{*}/2\\pi\\right)^{2/3}=1.9\\,R_{*}$.\nThe extent of the magnetosphere is assumed to be slightly smaller than\n$R_{\\mathrm{cr}}$; hence, we set the inner and outer radii of the\nmagnetospheric accretion funnel as $R_{\\mathrm{mi}}=1.3\\, R_{*}$ and\n$R_{\\mathrm{mo}}=1.7\\, R_{*}$, respectively. \nThese radii (in units of the\nstellar radius) are considerably smaller than those of classical\nT~Tauri stars (e.g.~\\citealt{Koenigl:1991};\n\\citealt{Muzerolle:2004}) which typically has larger rotation periods,\ni.e. 7--10\\,d (e.g.~\\citealt{Herbst:2002}).  The smaller magnetosphere\nsize in HD~58647 leads to smaller volumes for the accretion\nfunnels. Hence, the hydrogen line emission is also expected to be \nmuch weaker. \\cite{Muzerolle:2004} also found that the emission lines\nfrom a small and rotating magnetosphere were very weak in their\nBalmer line models for the Herbig Ae star UX~Ori (see their Fig.~3). \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ma-tm-effect} shows a comparison of the observed\nBr$\\gamma$ profile from the AMBER observation\n(Section~\\ref{sec:observations}) with the model profiles computed using the\nparameters for HD~58647 (Table~\\ref{tab:stellar-param}).  The models\nare computed for 3 different magnetospheric temperatures:\n$T_{\\mathrm{m}}= 7500$, 8000 and 8500\\,K  (Models~A, B and C in\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}, respectively). The continuum emission\nfrom the ring are omitted here so that the emission component from\nthe magnetosphere can be seen more easily.  As expected, the lines are\nrather weak, and are mainly in absorption \nexcept for very small emission components around the velocities $v=\\pm\n100\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ in the lower temperature models (Models~A and B). No\nsignificant emission above the continuum level is seen \nfor models with $T_{\\mathrm{m}}>8500\\,{\\mathrm{K}}$. Similar line\nshapes and strength are also found in the small magnetosphere model of\n\\cite{Muzerolle:2004} (their Fig.~3). \n\nThe models clearly disagree with the observed line profiles in their\nemission strengths, i.e.\\,the emission from the magnetosphere is much\nweaker than the observed one. If the ring continuum emission is\nincluded in the models, the emission components in the models will\nappear even weaker. As suggested by \\cite{Muzerolle:2004}, one way to\nincrease the emission strength is to increase the size of\nmagnetosphere; however, this will be in contradiction with the stellar\nparameters estimated earlier. It is most likely that an\nadditional gas flow component is involved in the formation of the\nBr$\\gamma$ emission line. This possibility will be explored next. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig05.pdf}\n\n\\caption{Comparison of the observed Br$\\gamma$ line profile (solid)\n  with the line profiles computed at the inclination angle\n  $i=55^{\\circ}$ with a rotating magnetosphere with different\n  temperatures: $T_{\\mathrm{m}} =$ 7500 (Model~A, dot), 8000 (Model~B,\n  dash) and 8500\\,K (Model~C, dash-dot).

We have explored various combinations\nof the disc wind model parameters (i.e.~$\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$,\n$D$, $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ as\nin Section~\\ref{subsub:DW-config}; see also\nFig.~\\ref{fig:model-config}) and the continuum-emitting ring size\n($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ as in Section~\\ref{subsub:Ring-config}) to fit\nthe observed Br$\\gamma$ from  the AMBER observation. The range of the\nmodel parameters explored are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:dw-param-range}. \nIn this analysis, we set the inner and outer wind radii\n($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$) to coincide with the outer\nradius of the magnetosphere $R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$ and the ring radius\n($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$), respectively. $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ is set to the\nmagnetospheric radius because a magnetosphere would set the inner\nradius of the accretion disc where the disc wind mass-loss flux would\nbe highest (e.g.~\\citealt{krasnopolsky:2003}), and because a wind\ncould arise in the disc-magnetosphere interaction region\n(e.g.~\\citealt{shu:1994,Shu:1995}; \\citealt{Romanova:2009}). The outer\nwind launching radius $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$ is set to\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ because the size of Br$\\gamma$ emission was found \nto be smaller than the size of the K-band continuum-emitting region in\nSection~\\ref{sec:observations}, i.e. the visibility level increases in the line (by\n$\\sim 0.1$) at the longest projected baseline of the VLTI-AMBER\nobservation (Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}). Hence, no significant wind\nemission is expected to be seen at radial \ndistances beyond $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$. \n\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:compare-ma-dw} shows that our model with a magnetosphere\nplus disc wind (Model~F) can reasonably\nreproduce the observed Br$\\gamma$ profile. The figure also shows the\nmodels computed with a magnetosphere only (Model~D) and a disc wind\nonly (Model~E) to demonstrate the contributions from each\ncomponent. The corresponding model parameters are shown in\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}.  As one can see from the figure, the\nemission line is much stronger when the \nemission from the disc wind is included in the model. The match\nbetween the observation and Model~F is quite good. As seen in the\nprevious section, the line profile from the magnetosphere only model\n(Model~D) is mainly in absorption, and the emission from the disc\nwind is dominating the line.  The central absorption dip is\nenhanced by the absorption in the magnetosphere, and the corresponding\nmatch with the observation is slightly better for Model~F, compared to the\nmodel with the disc wind alone (Model~E).\nIn Model~F, the ratio of the mass-loss rate in the wind to the\nmass-accretion rate ($\\mu =\n\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}/\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}$) is about 0.13.\n\n\n\nA prominent characteristics in the model profiles is their\ndouble-peaked appearance. Since these lines are mainly formed near the\nbase of the disc wind where the Keplerian rotation of the wind is dominating\nover the poloidal motion, the double-peak profiles naturally occurs\nwhen the disc wind is viewed edge-on, i.e.,\nwhen a system has a mid to high inclination angle ($i$). The extent of \nthe line profile can be also explained by the Keplerian velocity\n($V_{\\mathrm{k}}$) of the disc. At the inner radius of the disc wind\n($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}=1.7\\,R_{*}$), $V_{\\mathrm{k}}=289\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$. The\ncorresponding projected velocity is\n$V_{\\mathrm{k}}\\sin55^{\\circ}=237\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which is very similar to\nthe extent of the observed Br$\\gamma$ profile. This also indicates\nthat our choice of the inner radius of the disc wind, which coincides\nwith the outer radius of the magnetosphere, is reasonable. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c}\n   \\hspace{-1.0cm}\n   \\vspace{+0.3cm}\n   \\includegraphics[clip,width=0.35\\textwidth]{fig07a.pdf}\\tabularnewline\n   \\includegraphics[clip,width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig07b.pdf}\\tabularnewline\n\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\\caption{Upper panel: the model Br$\\gamma$ profile (dash) computed at\n  $i=55^{\\circ}$ with the magnetosphere and disc wind (Model~F in\n  Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}) is compared with the AMBER observation\n  (solid).

The model intensity maps allow us\nto compute the wavelength-dependent visibilities, differential and\nclosure phases, and to compare them directly with the observation.\nAs in the geometrical ring fit for the LR VLTI-AMBER continuum\nvisibilities in Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}, the position angle (PA)\nof the system is measure from north to east, i.e. the disc/ring normal axis\ncoincides with the north direction when PA is zero, and PA \nincrease as the disc/ring normal axis rotates towards east\n(cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:uv-coverage}). \n\nExamples of the intensity maps computed for Model~F\n(Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}), with the velocity interval $\\Delta v =\n\\,50 {\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ between -200 and 200\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image}. Here, the images are computed with\n$\\mathrm{PA}=0\\degr$ for a demonstration. The figure also shows the corresponding\nmodel Br$\\gamma$ profile marked with the same velocity channels used\nfor the images. As expected, the shape of the ring continuum\nemission does not change across the line, and the emission is\nuniform. On the other hand, the wind emission size and shape greatly\ndepend on the wavelength/radial velocity. The dependency is consistent with\nthe motion of the gas in the disc wind. The wind base is\nrotating at the local Keplerian velocities of the accretion disc\n(between 289 and 78\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ from $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}=1.7\\,R_{*}$ to\n$R_{\\mathrm{wo}}=23.5\\,R_{*}$).   As one can see from the figure, the\nwind on the left-hand side is approaching us, and that on the\nright-hand side is moving away from us due to the rotational motion of\nthe wind.  If the motion of the Br$\\gamma$-emitting gas is dominated by the poloidal\ncomponent, the images would rather have a left-right symmetry. However,\nthis is not the case in our intensity maps. This also indicates that\nthe Br$\\gamma$ emission mainly occurs near the base of the wind where\nthe rotational motion dominates.  The radial extent of the Br$\\gamma$\nemission in the disc wind is estimated as $\\sim$0.5~au from the\nintensity maps (with the velocity channels $\\pm 50\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ which show\nthe maximum radial extent of the line emission).\n\nBy using the emission maps and scaling their sizes according to the\ndistance to HD~58647 (318~pc, VL07), we have\ncomputed the wavelength-dependent visibilities, differential and\nclosure phases for Models~D, E and F. Here, the maps are computed\nusing the same velocity interval as in the AMBER observations, i.e. $\\Delta v \\approx\n13\\, {\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$. \nThe computed images are rotated\nby the PA of the system, which is assumed to be a\nfree parameter. Since the continuum-emitting ring and the disc wind are not spherical\nsymmetric, the visibilities levels, differential and closure phases\nare sensitive to the PA of the system. Hence, these interferometric data\nare used as additional constraints for the model fitting procedure\nwith the PA as an additional parameter.  \nThe results are summarised in Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}. The figure\nshows the models computed with the inclination angle $i=55^{\\circ}$, \nthe system position angle $\\mathrm{PA} = 85^{\\circ}$ and the\ncontinuum-emitting ring radius $R_{\\mathrm{Ring}}=23.5\\,R_{*}$ for the\n3 different cases: (1)~the model with magnetospheric accretion only \n(Model~D), (2)~the model with the disc wind only (Model~E), and\n(3)~the model with a magnetosphere and disc wind (Model~F). \n\nIn the first case (Model~D: with magnetosphere; see\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}), the agreement of the continuum \nvisibilities with the AMBER observation is excellent, but large\ndisagreements in the line profile shape (as in\nSections~\\ref{subsub:line-MA-model} and \\ref{subsub:line-DW-model}) and the\ndifferential phases in the line can be seen. \nThe angular size of the magnetosphere is about 0.15\\,mas; hence, it is\nunresolved by the interferometer. There is a slight indication\nfor a depression in the visibility level at the line centre due to the\nmagnetospheric absorption. The photo-centre shifts due to the\npresence of the magnetosphere are very small on all baselines; hence,\nthere is no change in the differential phases within the line.  This\n clearly disagrees with the observed differential phases which show\n S-shape signals across the line for two baselines. Similarly, the\n model closure phases are essentially zero across the line due to the\nsmall angular size of the magnetosphere, which is consistent with\nthe observations within in their large error bars ($\\sim \\pm 20^{\\circ}$ as\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}). \n\nIn the second case (Model~E: with a disc wind; see\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}), the agreement of the differential phases\nwith the observation is excellent. This indicates that the disc wind\nmodel used here is reasonable. Main disagreements are seen in the line\nstrength and the visibility levels for the longest project\nbaseline (88\\,m: UT2-UT4). The model Br$\\gamma$ line profile is slightly too strong\ncompared to the observed one, and the continuum visibility level for\nthe longest baseline in the model is too low compared to the\nobservation.  If we adopt a smaller ring size, the visibility levels\nfor the longest baseline would increase, but the line strength (with\nrespect to the continuum) would also increase.  Hence, the disagreement\nin the line profiles would also increase unless we decrease the line\nstrength by decreasing, for example, the disc wind mass-loss rate\n($\\dot{M_{\\mathrm{dw}}}$). \nThe situation can be improved if there is an additional \ncontinuum emission component which is more compact than the ring\ncontinuum emission. For example, the continuum emission from the\nmagnetosphere as in the first case (Model D) will make the line weaker\nand make the visibility slightly larger.  A small S-shape variation in\nclosure phases across the line is seen in the model due to the\nnon-spherical symmetric nature of the disc wind emission. The\namplitude of the variation is relatively small ($\\sim 7^{\\circ}$), and\nit does not disagree with the data which have rather large error bars\n($\\sim \\pm 20^{\\circ}$ as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}).\n\n\n\nIn the third case, the model (Model~F: with a magnetosphere and disc\nwind; see Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}) fits all the observed\ninterferometric quantities, including the line profile, very well.\nThis is our best case of the three models. In particular, the model\nsimultaneously reproduces the following characteristics in the\nobserved interferometric data: (1)~the double-peak Br$\\gamma$ profile,\n(1)~the double-peak variation of the visibilities across the line\n(especially for the longest project baseline), (3)~the S-shape\nvariations of the differential phases across the line, and (4)~the\nsmall amplitude in the variation of the closure phases across the\nline.  The locations of the peaks in the visibilities curves are\napproximately $\\pm 50\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which corresponds to the two peaks in\nthe line profile. The line emission maps shown earlier\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image}) also suggests that the extent of the line\nemission from the disc wind is largest at these velocities.\n\nIn summary, our radiative transfer model (Model~F in\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}), which uses a combination of a \nsmall magnetosphere and a disc wind with its inner radius\nat the outer radius of the magnetosphere, is in good agreement with\nthe observed interferometric data for HD~58647. The extent of the\nline-emitting disc wind region (the outer radius \nof the intensity distribution $\\sim0.5$~au as in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image}) is slightly smaller \nthan the K-band continuum-emitting ring size\n($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=23.5\\,R_{*}$ or 0.68~au) which approximately \ncorresponds to the dust sublimation radius of the system. \n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion }\n\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Continuum-emitting regions}\n\\label{sub:discuss-cont-region}\n\nIn Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}, we used a simple geometrical model\n(an elongated ring) and the observed continuum\nvisibilities to estimate the size of the K-band continuum-emitting\nregion. The angular radius of the ring emission was estimated as\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=2.0$~mas  or equivalently\n0.64~au at the distance of 318~pc (VL07)\n(Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param}). This radius is \nslightly larger than the value obtained by MO05, i.e.\\,$1.47$~mas.\nHowever, their radius determination does not include the effect of ring\nelongation/inclination because the $uv$-coverage of the Keck\nInterferometer in MO05 provides almost no two-dimensional\ninformation.  Further, the ring radius estimated in\nSection~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit} \n(0.64~au) is slightly smaller than the value used in the radiative\ntransfer models (Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}),\ni.e.\\,$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.68$~au. \nThe larger continuum radius is used in the radiative transfer model to\nreproduced the observed visibilities because of the additional compact\ncontinuum emission from the magnetosphere, which is not \nincluded in the geometric model in Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}. \n\nAssuming a dust sublimation temperature of 1500~K and the stellar luminosity\nof  $L_{*}=412\\,{\\mathrm{L_{\\sun}}}$ \n(Section~\\ref{subsub:adopted-param}), the size-luminosity\nrelationship in MO05 provides a dust sublimation radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ of $0.64$~au. \nThis is very similar to the ring radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.68$~au used in the radiative transfer model\n(Model~F), which fits our AMBER continuum visibility observation\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}). \n\n\n\\subsection{Disc wind launching regions}\n\\label{sub:discuss-line-region}\nAccording to the disc wind model (Model~F), which fits the\nspectro-interferometric observation in Section~\\ref{sub:model-vis}\nwell, the inner radius of the disc-wind launching region ($R_\\mathrm{wi}$)\nis only 0.05~au, which is located just outside of the \nmagnetosphere.  This radius is much smaller than the dust sublimation radius\n($R_\\mathrm{s}$), which is approximately equal to the radius of the\ncontinuum-emitting geometrical ring $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.68$~au, as\nshown in the previous section. Next, we compare the size of the inner\nradius of the disc-wind launching region of our HD~58647 model with\nthose found in earlier studies of other Herbig Ae/Be stars, in which\nthe VLTI-AMBER in the high spectral \nresolution mode and radiative transfer models for\nBr$\\gamma$ were used. Only three such studies are available in the\nliterature: the Herbig Be star MWC~297 (\\citealt{Weigelt:2011}), the\nHerbig Ae star MWC~275 (\\citealt{GarciaLopez:2015}) and the Herbig Be\nstar HD~98922 (\\citealt{Caratti:2015}). These studies used similar\nkinematic disc wind models to probe the wind-launching region of these\nstars. Fig.~\\ref{fig:compare-sizes}\nshows the inner radii of the disc wind launching regions plotted as a\nfunction of stellar luminosity (see also\nTable~\\ref{tab:amber-hr-sizes}).\\footnote{\\citet{Benisty:2010},\n  \\citet{Kraus:2012b}, \n  \\citet{Ellerbroek:2015} and \\citet{Mendigutia:2015} presented the high spectral resolution \nVLTI-AMBER observations of Z~CMa, V921 Sco, HD~50138 and HD~100564, respectively;\nhowever, their observations were not analysed with a radiative\ntransfer model with a disc wind. Hence, we excluded their\nresults from this analysis.} The figure shows that the inner radius of\nthe wind launching region \nincreases as the luminosity increases.  By fitting the data with a\npower-law, we find the following relation: \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\nwhere $V_{*}$ is the stellar visibility (e.g.~\\citealt{Kreplin:2012}).\nHere, we assume $V_{*}=1$ since the central star is unresolved (its\nangular radius is $\\sim$0.07~mas at the distance of 318~pc, \nVL07). To estimate the ratio of the circumstellar\nto stellar fluxes, we compare the stellar atmosphere model of \\citet{Kurucz:1979}\nwith $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=10500\\,$K and $\\log g_{*}=3.5$ (\\citealt{Montesinos:2009}) with the K-band\nphotometry data from VO SED Analyzer tool (VOSA, \\citealt{Bayo:2008}),\nafter dereddening the data ($A_{V}=0.4$ , \\citealt{Malfait:1998}). \nThe original photometric data are from\n\\citet*{Ochsenbein:2000}. The target distance ($d\\sim318$~pc, VL07) \nis adopted from the \\textit{Hipparcos} measurement. We find the flux\nratio is $F_{\\mathrm{circ}}/F_{*}=2.9$ \nat $\\mbox{\\ensuremath{\\lambda}=}2.2\\,\\micron$. Using this value and\nequation~\\ref{eq:vis-circumstellar}, the circumstellar visibilities\n$V_{\\mathrm{circ}}$ are determined for each set of the LR VLTI-AMBER\nobservations (Table~\\ref{tab:obs-log-low-res}). The results are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ring-fit}.  The figure suggests that the emission\ngeometry deviates from a spherical symmetry because e.g.~the\ncircumstellar visibilities at the spatial frequency $\\sim30\\times 10^{6}\\,\\lambda$\n(e.g. in the data sets~C and D) are notably different for the\nbaselines with different position angles. \n\nTo model the circumstellar visibilities $V_{\\mathrm{circ}}$, we\nconsider an inclined uniform ring geometry with an inner radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ and a width $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ because the\nK-band continuum of the discs of Herbig stars is expected to originate\nmainly from the region near the dust sublimation radius (e.g.~MO05;\n\\citealt{Dullemond:2010}).  Here, we assume $\\Delta\nR_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.2\\, R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ as in MO05. The elongation\nof the ring occurs when the circular ring has an inclination angle\n$i>0^{\\circ}$.  We use this two-dimensional model to fit the set of\nall visibilities from the LR observations simultaneously, instead\nof fitting one-dimensional model visibilities to individual observed\nvisibilities.  The results of the best-fit model are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ring-fit}. The corresponding model parameters are\nsummarised in Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param}. As one can see from the\nfigure, the simple geometrical model with a ring can reasonably fit\nthe observed visibilities. In this analysis, we find that the angular\nradius of the K-band continuum-emitting ring is around 2.0~mas\n(Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param}), which corresponds to 0.64~au at the\ndistance of 318~pc (VL07).\n\n\n\\section{Radiative Transfer Models}\n\n\\label{sec:RT-models}\n\n\nTo model the interferometric quantities obtained by VLTI-AMBER in\nthe high-spectral-resolution mode, i.e.~the wavelength-dependent flux,\nvisibility and differential and closure phases around Br$\\gamma$\npresented in Section~\\ref{sec:observations}, we use the radiative\ntransfer code {\\sc torus} (e.g.~\\citealt{Harries:2000, Symington:2005,\n  Kurosawa:2006}; KU11).  The numerical method used in the\ncurrent work is\nessentially the same as in KU11. The model uses the\ntree-structured grid (octree/quadtree in 3-D and 2-D, respectively) in\ncartesian coordinate, but here we assume axisymmetry around the\nstellar rotation axis.  The atomic model consists of hydrogen with 20\nenergy levels, and the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE)\nlevel populations are solved using the Sobolev approximation\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Sobolev:1957,castor:1970,castor:1979}. More\ncomprehensive descriptions of the code are given in KU11.\n\nFor the present work, we have made three minor modifications to the code\nin KU11: (1)~the model now includes the continuum\nemission from a geometrically flat ring which simulates the K-band dust\nemission near the dust sublimation radius, (2)~the effect of rotation\nof a magnetosphere has been included by using the method described in\n\\cite*{Muzerolle:2001}, and (3)~the code has been modified to write\nmodel intensity maps as a function of wavelength (or velocity\nbins). The first modification is important for modelling a correct\nline strength of Br$\\gamma$ (2.2166~$\\mu$m) and the interferometric\nquantities around the line. The second modification is included\nbecause intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be stars are expected to be\nrotating relatively fast with their rotation periods about $0.2$ to a few\ndays (e.g.~\\citealt{Hubrig:2009}, but see also\n\\citealt{Hubrig:2011}). Until now,\nour model has been applied mainly to classical T Tauri stars which\nrotate relatively slowly with their rotation period 2--10\\,d\n(e.g.~\\citealt{Herbst:1987}; \\citealt{Herbst:1994}) in which  the effect\nof rotation is rather small (e.g.~\\citealt{Muzerolle:2001}). The\nthird modification is important because it will allow us to compute\nthe interferometric quantities, \nsuch as visibility, differential and closure phases, as a function of\nwavelength. This enables us to directly compare our models with the\nspectro-interferometric data from VLTI-AMBER.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Model configurations }\n\\label{sub:model-config}\n\n\nThere are 4 distinct emission components in our model: (1)~the central\nstar, (2)~the magnetospheric accretion funnels as described by\n\\citet*{Hartmann:1994} and \\citet{Muzerolle:2001}, (3)~the disc wind\nwhich emerges from the equatorial plane (a geometrically thin\naccretion disc) located outside of the magnetosphere and (4)~the\ngeometrically flat ring which simulates the K-band dust emission near\nthe dust sublimation radius.  A basic schematic diagram of our models\nis shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:model-config}.  In the following, we\nbriefly describe each component and the key parameters. More\ncomprehensive descriptions of the magnetosphere and disc wind\ncomponents can be found in KU11.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig04.pdf}\n\n\n\\caption{The model configuration of the circumstellar materials around\n  the Herbig Be star HD~58647.  The density is assumed\n  to be axisymmetric and top-down symmetric. The model consists\n  of: (1)~the stellar continuum source (star) located at the origin of \n  the cartesian coordinates system ($w$,$z$), (2)~the magnetospheric accretion\n  flow, (3)~the disc wind, (4)~the K-band continuum-emitting ring, \n  and (5)~the geometrically thin accretion disc. The split-monopole (with the source\n  displacement distance $D$) disc wind emerges from the equatorial\n  plane, but only within the distances from $z$-axis between\n  $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$. The geometrically thin ring\n  with its inner radius $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ and width $\\Delta\n  R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ is also placed on\n  the equatorial plane. See Section~\\ref{sub:model-config} for more\n  information.  The figure is not to scale. \\label{fig:model-config} }\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Central star}\n\n\\label{subsub:Central-star}\n\nThe central star is the main source of continuum radiation which ionizes the\ngas in the flow components (a magnetospheric accretion and a disc\nwind).  For a given effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and its\nsurface gravity $\\log g_*$, we use the stellar atmosphere model of\n\\citet{Kurucz:1979} as the photospheric contribution to the \ncontinuum in our model.  Our underlying central star is a late B-type star;\nhence, the photospheric absorption component from the star may affect\nthe shape of the model Br$\\gamma$ profiles. For this reason, we use\nthe high-spectral-resolution synthetic \\textsc{phoenix}\n(\\citealt{Hauschildt:1999}) spectra from \\citet{Husser:2013},\nconvolved with $v\\sin i=118\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ (\\citealt{Mora:2001}) for the\nphotospheric absorption profile for Br$\\gamma$. \n\n\\subsubsection{Magnetosphere }\n\n\\label{subsub:MA-config}\n\nWe adopt a dipole magnetic field geometry with its accretion\nstream described by $r=R_{\\mathrm{m}}\\,\\sin^{2}{\\theta}$ where $r$ and\n$\\theta$ are the polar coordinates; $R_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the\nmagnetospheric radius on the equatorial plane, as in\ne.g.~\\cite{ghosh:1977} and \\cite{Hartmann:1994}. In this model, the\naccretion occurs in the funnel regions defined by two stream lines\nwhich correspond to the inner and outer magnetospheric radii, i.e.,\n$R_{\\mathrm{m}}=R_{\\mathrm{mi}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:model-config}).  As in KU11, we follow\nthe density and temperature structures along the stream lines as in\n~\\citet{Hartmann:1994} and \\cite{Muzerolle:2001}. The temperature\nscale is normalised with a parameter $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ which sets the\nmaximum temperature in the stream. The mass-accretion rate\n$\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ scales the density of the magnetospheric\naccretion funnels. We adopt the method described in \n\\cite{Muzerolle:2001} (their Appendix A), to include the effect of rotation in the\naccretion funnels.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Disc wind}\n\n\\label{subsub:DW-config}\n\n\n\n\nAs in KU11, the disc wind model used here is based on\nthe `split-monopole' wind model by e.g.~\\citet{knigge:1995} and\n\\citet{Long:2002} (see also \\citealt{Shlosman:1993}). The outflow\narises from the surface of the rotating accretion disc, and has a\nbi-conical geometry.  Most influential parameters in our models are:\n(1)~the total mass-loss rate in the disc wind ($\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$),\n(2)~the degree of the wind collimation, (3)~the steepness of the\nradial velocity ($\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ in\nequation~\\ref{eq:discwind-poloidal-velocity} below), and \n(4)~the wind temperature. Fig.~\\ref{fig:model-config} shows the basic\nconfiguration of the disc-wind model. The wind arises from the disc\nsurface. The wind ``source'' points ($S$), from which the stream lines\ndiverge, are placed at distance $D$ above and below the centre of the\nstar. The angle of the wind launching is controlled by changing the\nvalue of $D$. The wind launching is confined between $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$\nand $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$ where the former is normally set to the outer\nradius of the closed magnetosphere ($R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$) and the latter\nto be a free parameter.  The wind density is normalised with the total\nmass-loss rate in the disc wind ($\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$) while the\nlocal mass-loss rate per unit area ($\\dot{m}$) follows the power-law\n$\\dot{m} \\propto w^{-p}$ where $w$ is the distance from the star on the\nequatorial plane and $p=2.4$ (our fiducial value which produces\nreasonable Br$\\gamma$ line profiles). \n\nThe poloidal component of the wind velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{p}}$) is parametrised as: \n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  v_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(w_{i},l\\right)=c_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(w_{i}\\right)+\\left[f\\,\n    v_{\\mathrm{esc}}-c_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(w_{i}\\right)\\right]\n    \\left(1-\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{s}}}{l+R_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\right)^{\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}}\n  \\label{eq:discwind-poloidal-velocity}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"v_{\\mathrm{p}}\\left(w_{i},l\\right)=c_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(w_{i}\\right)+\\left[f\\,v%&#10;_{\\mathrm{esc}}-c_{\\mathrm{s}}\\left(w_{i}\\right)\\right]\\left(1-\\frac{R_{%&#10;\\mathrm{s}}}{l+R_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\right)^{\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>f</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>esc</mi></msub></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi></msub><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><msub><mi>\u03b2</mi><mi>dw</mi></msub></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02209.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $a=2.0(^{+1.1}_{-0.7}) \\times 10^{-3}$ and $b=0.59(\\pm0.07)$.\nAs in Table~\\ref{tab:amber-hr-sizes}, the inner radius of the wind\nlaunching region is only a  few times larger than the stellar radius\n($1.7$--$3.0\\,R_{*}$) for MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647, which\nhave similar spectral types (A1 and B9). On the other hand, it is much larger\n($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}=17.5\\,R_{*}$) for MWC~297 which has a much \nearlier spectral type (B1.5). This may suggest that the environment\nof the wind-launching regions in MWC~297 might be different from\nthose in MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647. The difference between\nthe wind-launching region of MWC~297 and those of the lower\nluminosity stars may be caused by the difference in the strength of \nstellar and/or disc radiation (pressure) which may influence the\nwind launching radius and wind dynamics (e.g.~\\citealt{Drew:1997};\n\\citealt*{Proga:1999}).   \n\n\nThe physical origin of the relation in \nequation~\\ref{eq:dw-inner-radius} is unknown. The increase in\n$R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ for the stars with lower luminosities (MWC~275,\nHD~98922 and HD~58647) may simply reflect the increase in their\nstellar radii (the fourth column in Table~\\ref{tab:amber-hr-sizes}),\nwhich, in turn, set the size of magnetospheric radius or the inner\nradius of the accretion disc from which the wind arises.  The cause of\nthe increase in $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ from the three stars with lower\nluminosities (MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647) to MWC~297 is even more\nuncertain since the stellar radius of MWC~297 is not significantly\nlarger than the others.\n\n\nAnother difference between MWC~297 and the other three stars in our\nsample can be found in their K-band continuum emission\nradii. Fig.~\\ref{fig:compare-sizes} also shows the radius of the\nK-band continuum-emitting ring for each object along with the expected\ndust sublimation radii (assuming the dust sublimation temperature of\n1500\\,K) computed from the size-luminosity relation in MO05. While the\nring radii of MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647 follow the expected\nsize-luminosity relation, that of MWC~297 falls below the expected\nvalue for the dust sublimation temperature of 1500~K. The continuum\nring radius is about 10 times larger than the inner radius of the disc\nwind in MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647, but it is only 1.1 times\nlarger for the luminous MWC~297.  The tendency for the high luminosity\nHerbig Be stars ($L_{*}>10^{3}\\,{\\mathrm{L_{\\sun}}}$) to have an `undersized' dust\nsublimation radius is pointed out by MO05. They suggest that the\ninnermost gas accretion disc might be optically thick for luminous\nHerbig Be stars, and it partially blocks the stellar radiation on to\nthe disc, hence causing a smaller dust sublimation radius (see also\n\\citealt{Eisner:2004}).\n\n\nThe outflow, from which the observed\nBr$\\gamma$ emission line originates, is most likely formed in\nmagnetohydrodynamical processes, in either (1)~magneto-centrifugal disc\nwind (e.g.~\\citealt{blandford:1982,ouyed:1997,krasnopolsky:2003}) or\n(2)~a wind launched near the disc-magnetosphere interaction region\n(e.g.~an X-wind -- \\citealt{shu:1994,Shu:1995} or a conical wind --\n\\citealt{Romanova:2009}).  The (accretion-powered) stellar wind \n(e.g.~\\citealt{decampli:1981, hartmann:1982, Strafella:1998,\n  matt:2005, Cranmer:2009}) is unlikely the origin of Br$\\gamma$\nemission line in the case of HD~58647 because the line computed with such a wind\nwould have a single-peaked profile while the observed Br$\\gamma$ is\ndouble-peaked with its peak separation of $\\sim160\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}).  Our radiative transfer model uses a\nsimple disc wind plus a compact magnetosphere, and we have\ndemonstrated that this model is able to\nreproduce the interferometric observation with the VLTI-AMBER\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}). However, the disc wind in this\nmodel could also resemble the flows found in the conical wind and X-wind\nmodels, in which  the mass ejection region is also   \nconcentrated just outside of a magnetosphere.  \nThis is because the inner radius of the disc wind model (Model~F in \nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}) is also located just outside of \nthe magnetosphere. Further, the\nlocal mass-loss rate ($\\dot{m}$, the mass-loss rate per\nunit area) on the accretion disc in our model is a strong\nfunction of $w$ (the distance from the star on the accretion disc\nplane), i.e. $\\dot{m} \\propto w^{-2.4}$. Thus, the mass-loss flux is\n concentrated just outside of the magnetosphere as in the conical\nand X-wind models. It would be difficult to exclude the conical or X-wind as a\npossible outflow model in this case. Only when the inner radius of the\nwind launching region is significantly larger than the corotation\nradius of a star (as in MWC~297, Table~\\ref{tab:amber-hr-sizes}), they\ncould be safely excluded.   \n\nFinally, the rate of angular momentum loss by the disc wind\n($\\dot{J}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$) can be directly calculated in our model\n(Models~E and F) because we adopted the explicit forms of the\nmass-loss rate per unit area and the wind velocity law\n(Section~\\ref{subsub:DW-config}).  In the context of a\nmagneto-centrifugal disc wind model, the specific angular momentum\n($j$) transported along each magnetic field line can be written as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 63320, "prevtext": " \n\nwhere $w_{i}$, $c_{\\mathrm{s}}$, $f$, and $l$ are the distance from\nthe rotational axis ($z$) to\nthe wind emerging point on the disc, the sound speed at the\nwind launching point on the disc, the constant scale factor of the\nasymptotic terminal velocity to the local escape velocity ($v_{\\mathrm{esc}}$\nfrom the wind emerging point on the disc), and the distance from the\ndisc surface along stream lines respectively. $R_{s}$ is the wind\nscale length, and is set to 10~$R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ by following\n\\citet{Long:2002}. \nThe azimuthal component of the wind velocity $v_{\\phi}\\left(w,z\\right)$\nis computed from the Keplerian rotational velocity at the emerging\npoint of the stream line i.e. $v_{\\phi}\\left(w_{i},0\\right)=\\left(GM_{*}/w_{i}\\right)^{1/2}$\nby assuming the conservation of\nthe specific angular momentum along a stream line, i.e.\n $v_{\\phi}\\left(w,z\\right)\\,=v_{\\phi}\\left(w_{i},0\\right)\\,\\left(w_{i}/w\\right)$. \n\nThe temperature of the wind \n($T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$) is assumed to be isothermal. This is a reasonable\nassumption because the studies of disc wind thermal structures by\ne.g.~\\citet{Safier:1993} and \\citet{Garcia:2001} have shown that the\n wind is heated by ambipolar diffusion, and its temperature reaches $\\sim\n 10^{4}$\\,K quickly after being launched. Further, their studies\n have shown that the wind temperature remains almost constant or only\n slowly changes as the wind propagates after the temperature reaches $\\sim\n 10^{4}$\\,K. \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The K-band continuum-emitting ring}\n\n\\label{subsub:Ring-config}\nSince the K-band continuum of the accretion discs of Herbig stars is\nexpected to originate mainly from the region near the dust sublimation\nradius (e.g.~\\citealt{Dullemond:2010}), we simulate this emission with\na geometrically thin ring on the equatorial plane, with its inner\nradius $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ and its width $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:model-config}). This is the same geometrical model used\nto fit the continuum visibilities in\nSection~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}.  Again, we assume  \n$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.2\\, R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$, as in MO05. The\nring is assumed to have a uniform temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{ring}}=1500\\,{\\mathrm{K}}$, and to radiate as a blackbody. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Modelling Br$\\gamma$ line profiles}\n\n\\label{sub:model-line-prof}\n\n\nSince computing the wavelength/velocity-dependent image maps is\n rather computationally expensive, we first concentrate on modelling\nthe Br$\\gamma$ profile (top panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary})\nobtained with the AMBER instrument to find a reasonable set of model parameters \nwhich approximately matches the observed line profile. Then, we will\nexpand the model constraints to the rest of the observed\ninterferometric quantities (visibilities, differential and closure\nphases) to further refine the model fit by computing the\nwavelength/velocity-dependent image maps for each model\n(Section~\\ref{sub:model-vis}).    \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Adopted stellar parameters}\n\n\\label{subsub:adopted-param}\n\nThe basic stellar parameters adopted for modelling the observed AMBER\ndata of our target HD~58647 are summarised in\nTable~\\ref{tab:stellar-param}.  We estimated the stellar luminosity\n$L_*$ by fitting the SED of HD~58647 using the VOSA online SED\nanalyzing tool (\\citealt{Bayo:2008}) using \n$T_{\\mathrm{eff}}=10500$~K and $\\log g_{*}=3.5$ (cgs)\n(\\citealt{Montesinos:2009}), the extinction $A_{V}=0.4$\n(\\citealt{Malfait:1998}) and the distance $d=318$\\,pc\n(VL07).  From this fit, we find\n$L_{*}=412\\,{\\mathrm{L_{\\sun}}}$.  Using the evolutionary tracks of pre-main\nsequence stars by \\citet*{Siess:2000} with the stellar luminosity found\nabove and $\\log g_{*}=3.5$, the stellar mass and radius of HD~58647\nare estimated as $M_{*}=4.6\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}}}$ and $R_{*}=6.2\\,{\\mathrm{R_{\\sun}}}$,\nrespectively.\n\n\nThe inclination angle $i$ of the K-band continuum-emitting ring was\nestimated as $i\\approx55^{\\circ}$ in Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}\n(Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param})  \nby fitting the continuum visibilities. Assuming the disc/ring normal vector coincides with the\nrotation axis of HD~58647 and the speed at which the star rotates at\nthe equator ($v_{\\mathrm{eq}}$) is same as $v$ in $v\\sin i$, we obtain\n$v_{\\mathrm{eq}}=144\\,\\mathrm{km\\, s^{-1}}$ (approximately $0.34$ of\nthe breakup velocity) using $v\\sin i=118\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$\n(\\citealt{Mora:2001}). Consequently, the rotation period of HD~58647\nis estimated as $P_{*}=2\\pi R_{*}/v_{\\mathrm{eq}}=2.2$~d.  We adopt\nthe mass-accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}=3.5\\times\n10^{-7}\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$ (\\citealt{Brittain:2007}), which is estimated\nfrom the CO line luminosity, in our magnetospheric accretion model.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\n\\caption{Adopted parameters of HD\\,58647 models. \\label{tab:stellar-param} }\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccc}\n\\hline \n$R_{*}$  & $M_{*}$  & $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$  & $P_{*}$ & $d$  & $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ & $i$\\tabularnewline\n(${\\mathrm{R_{\\sun}}}$)  & (${\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}}}$)  & ($\\mathrm{K}$)  & (d) & ($\\mathrm{pc}$)  & (${\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$) & ($^{\\circ}$)\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n$6.2$  & $4.6$  & $10500$  & $2.2$ & $318$  & $3.5\\times10^{-7}$ & $55$\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\\end{center}\n\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\n\\caption{Main model parameters. \\label{tab:model-param}}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccccccccccc}\n\\hline \n & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{Magnetosphere} &  & \\multicolumn{6}{c}{Disc\n  wind} &  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Continuum Ring}\\tabularnewline\n\\cline{2-4} \\cline{6-11} \\cline{13-14} \n & $R_{\\mathrm{mi}}$ & $R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$ & $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ &  & $\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ & $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ & $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$ & $D$ & $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ & $\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ &  & $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ & $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$\\tabularnewline\nModel  & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($\\mathrm{K}$)  &  & (${\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{*}$) & ($\\mathrm{K}$) & $\\cdots$ &  & ($R_{*}$) & ($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$)\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \nA & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $7500$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$\\tabularnewline\nB & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8000$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$\\tabularnewline\nC & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8500$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$\\tabularnewline\nD & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8000$ &  & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $23.5$ & $0.2$\\tabularnewline\nE & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ &  & $4.5\\times10^{-8}$ & $1.7$ & $23.5$ & $100$ & $10^{4}$ & $2.0$ &  & $23.5$ & $0.2$\\tabularnewline\nF & $1.3$ & $1.7$ & $8000$ &  & $4.5\\times10^{-8}$ & $1.7$ & $23.5$ & $100$ & $10^{4}$ & $2.0$ &  & $23.5$ & $0.2$\\tabularnewline\n\\hline \n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Br$\\gamma$ profiles from magnetospheric accretion models}\n\n\\label{subsub:line-MA-model}\n\nHere, we briefly examine the effect of magnetospheric accretion\n(Section~\\ref{subsub:MA-config}) on the formation of the hydrogen\nrecombination line Br$\\gamma$.  Using the stellar\nparameters above, the corotation radius ($R_{\\mathrm{cr}}$) of\nHD~58647 is estimated as \n$R_{\\mathrm{cr}}=\\left(GM_{*}\\right)^{1/3}\\left(P_{*}/2\\pi\\right)^{2/3}=1.9\\,R_{*}$.\nThe extent of the magnetosphere is assumed to be slightly smaller than\n$R_{\\mathrm{cr}}$; hence, we set the inner and outer radii of the\nmagnetospheric accretion funnel as $R_{\\mathrm{mi}}=1.3\\, R_{*}$ and\n$R_{\\mathrm{mo}}=1.7\\, R_{*}$, respectively. \nThese radii (in units of the\nstellar radius) are considerably smaller than those of classical\nT~Tauri stars (e.g.~\\citealt{Koenigl:1991};\n\\citealt{Muzerolle:2004}) which typically has larger rotation periods,\ni.e. 7--10\\,d (e.g.~\\citealt{Herbst:2002}).  The smaller magnetosphere\nsize in HD~58647 leads to smaller volumes for the accretion\nfunnels. Hence, the hydrogen line emission is also expected to be \nmuch weaker. \\cite{Muzerolle:2004} also found that the emission lines\nfrom a small and rotating magnetosphere were very weak in their\nBalmer line models for the Herbig Ae star UX~Ori (see their Fig.~3). \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:ma-tm-effect} shows a comparison of the observed\nBr$\\gamma$ profile from the AMBER observation\n(Section~\\ref{sec:observations}) with the model profiles computed using the\nparameters for HD~58647 (Table~\\ref{tab:stellar-param}).  The models\nare computed for 3 different magnetospheric temperatures:\n$T_{\\mathrm{m}}= 7500$, 8000 and 8500\\,K  (Models~A, B and C in\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}, respectively). The continuum emission\nfrom the ring are omitted here so that the emission component from\nthe magnetosphere can be seen more easily.  As expected, the lines are\nrather weak, and are mainly in absorption \nexcept for very small emission components around the velocities $v=\\pm\n100\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ in the lower temperature models (Models~A and B). No\nsignificant emission above the continuum level is seen \nfor models with $T_{\\mathrm{m}}>8500\\,{\\mathrm{K}}$. Similar line\nshapes and strength are also found in the small magnetosphere model of\n\\cite{Muzerolle:2004} (their Fig.~3). \n\nThe models clearly disagree with the observed line profiles in their\nemission strengths, i.e.\\,the emission from the magnetosphere is much\nweaker than the observed one. If the ring continuum emission is\nincluded in the models, the emission components in the models will\nappear even weaker. As suggested by \\cite{Muzerolle:2004}, one way to\nincrease the emission strength is to increase the size of\nmagnetosphere; however, this will be in contradiction with the stellar\nparameters estimated earlier. It is most likely that an\nadditional gas flow component is involved in the formation of the\nBr$\\gamma$ emission line. This possibility will be explored next. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig05.pdf}\n\n\\caption{Comparison of the observed Br$\\gamma$ line profile (solid)\n  with the line profiles computed at the inclination angle\n  $i=55^{\\circ}$ with a rotating magnetosphere with different\n  temperatures: $T_{\\mathrm{m}} =$ 7500 (Model~A, dot), 8000 (Model~B,\n  dash) and 8500\\,K (Model~C, dash-dot).

We have explored various combinations\nof the disc wind model parameters (i.e.~$\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$,\n$D$, $T_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{dw}}$ as\nin Section~\\ref{subsub:DW-config}; see also\nFig.~\\ref{fig:model-config}) and the continuum-emitting ring size\n($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ as in Section~\\ref{subsub:Ring-config}) to fit\nthe observed Br$\\gamma$ from  the AMBER observation. The range of the\nmodel parameters explored are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:dw-param-range}. \nIn this analysis, we set the inner and outer wind radii\n($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$) to coincide with the outer\nradius of the magnetosphere $R_{\\mathrm{mo}}$ and the ring radius\n($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$), respectively. $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ is set to the\nmagnetospheric radius because a magnetosphere would set the inner\nradius of the accretion disc where the disc wind mass-loss flux would\nbe highest (e.g.~\\citealt{krasnopolsky:2003}), and because a wind\ncould arise in the disc-magnetosphere interaction region\n(e.g.~\\citealt{shu:1994,Shu:1995}; \\citealt{Romanova:2009}). The outer\nwind launching radius $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$ is set to\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$ because the size of Br$\\gamma$ emission was found \nto be smaller than the size of the K-band continuum-emitting region in\nSection~\\ref{sec:observations}, i.e. the visibility level increases in the line (by\n$\\sim 0.1$) at the longest projected baseline of the VLTI-AMBER\nobservation (Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}). Hence, no significant wind\nemission is expected to be seen at radial \ndistances beyond $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}$. \n\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:compare-ma-dw} shows that our model with a magnetosphere\nplus disc wind (Model~F) can reasonably\nreproduce the observed Br$\\gamma$ profile. The figure also shows the\nmodels computed with a magnetosphere only (Model~D) and a disc wind\nonly (Model~E) to demonstrate the contributions from each\ncomponent. The corresponding model parameters are shown in\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}.  As one can see from the figure, the\nemission line is much stronger when the \nemission from the disc wind is included in the model. The match\nbetween the observation and Model~F is quite good. As seen in the\nprevious section, the line profile from the magnetosphere only model\n(Model~D) is mainly in absorption, and the emission from the disc\nwind is dominating the line.  The central absorption dip is\nenhanced by the absorption in the magnetosphere, and the corresponding\nmatch with the observation is slightly better for Model~F, compared to the\nmodel with the disc wind alone (Model~E).\nIn Model~F, the ratio of the mass-loss rate in the wind to the\nmass-accretion rate ($\\mu =\n\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}/\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}$) is about 0.13.\n\n\n\nA prominent characteristics in the model profiles is their\ndouble-peaked appearance. Since these lines are mainly formed near the\nbase of the disc wind where the Keplerian rotation of the wind is dominating\nover the poloidal motion, the double-peak profiles naturally occurs\nwhen the disc wind is viewed edge-on, i.e.,\nwhen a system has a mid to high inclination angle ($i$). The extent of \nthe line profile can be also explained by the Keplerian velocity\n($V_{\\mathrm{k}}$) of the disc. At the inner radius of the disc wind\n($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}=1.7\\,R_{*}$), $V_{\\mathrm{k}}=289\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$. The\ncorresponding projected velocity is\n$V_{\\mathrm{k}}\\sin55^{\\circ}=237\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which is very similar to\nthe extent of the observed Br$\\gamma$ profile. This also indicates\nthat our choice of the inner radius of the disc wind, which coincides\nwith the outer radius of the magnetosphere, is reasonable. \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c}\n   \\hspace{-1.0cm}\n   \\vspace{+0.3cm}\n   \\includegraphics[clip,width=0.35\\textwidth]{fig07a.pdf}\\tabularnewline\n   \\includegraphics[clip,width=0.48\\textwidth]{fig07b.pdf}\\tabularnewline\n\n\n\\end{tabular}\n\n\n\\caption{Upper panel: the model Br$\\gamma$ profile (dash) computed at\n  $i=55^{\\circ}$ with the magnetosphere and disc wind (Model~F in\n  Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}) is compared with the AMBER observation\n  (solid).

The model intensity maps allow us\nto compute the wavelength-dependent visibilities, differential and\nclosure phases, and to compare them directly with the observation.\nAs in the geometrical ring fit for the LR VLTI-AMBER continuum\nvisibilities in Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}, the position angle (PA)\nof the system is measure from north to east, i.e. the disc/ring normal axis\ncoincides with the north direction when PA is zero, and PA \nincrease as the disc/ring normal axis rotates towards east\n(cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:uv-coverage}). \n\nExamples of the intensity maps computed for Model~F\n(Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}), with the velocity interval $\\Delta v =\n\\,50 {\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ between -200 and 200\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, are shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image}. Here, the images are computed with\n$\\mathrm{PA}=0\\degr$ for a demonstration. The figure also shows the corresponding\nmodel Br$\\gamma$ profile marked with the same velocity channels used\nfor the images. As expected, the shape of the ring continuum\nemission does not change across the line, and the emission is\nuniform. On the other hand, the wind emission size and shape greatly\ndepend on the wavelength/radial velocity. The dependency is consistent with\nthe motion of the gas in the disc wind. The wind base is\nrotating at the local Keplerian velocities of the accretion disc\n(between 289 and 78\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ from $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}=1.7\\,R_{*}$ to\n$R_{\\mathrm{wo}}=23.5\\,R_{*}$).   As one can see from the figure, the\nwind on the left-hand side is approaching us, and that on the\nright-hand side is moving away from us due to the rotational motion of\nthe wind.  If the motion of the Br$\\gamma$-emitting gas is dominated by the poloidal\ncomponent, the images would rather have a left-right symmetry. However,\nthis is not the case in our intensity maps. This also indicates that\nthe Br$\\gamma$ emission mainly occurs near the base of the wind where\nthe rotational motion dominates.  The radial extent of the Br$\\gamma$\nemission in the disc wind is estimated as $\\sim$0.5~au from the\nintensity maps (with the velocity channels $\\pm 50\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ which show\nthe maximum radial extent of the line emission).\n\nBy using the emission maps and scaling their sizes according to the\ndistance to HD~58647 (318~pc, VL07), we have\ncomputed the wavelength-dependent visibilities, differential and\nclosure phases for Models~D, E and F. Here, the maps are computed\nusing the same velocity interval as in the AMBER observations, i.e. $\\Delta v \\approx\n13\\, {\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$. \nThe computed images are rotated\nby the PA of the system, which is assumed to be a\nfree parameter. Since the continuum-emitting ring and the disc wind are not spherical\nsymmetric, the visibilities levels, differential and closure phases\nare sensitive to the PA of the system. Hence, these interferometric data\nare used as additional constraints for the model fitting procedure\nwith the PA as an additional parameter.  \nThe results are summarised in Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}. The figure\nshows the models computed with the inclination angle $i=55^{\\circ}$, \nthe system position angle $\\mathrm{PA} = 85^{\\circ}$ and the\ncontinuum-emitting ring radius $R_{\\mathrm{Ring}}=23.5\\,R_{*}$ for the\n3 different cases: (1)~the model with magnetospheric accretion only \n(Model~D), (2)~the model with the disc wind only (Model~E), and\n(3)~the model with a magnetosphere and disc wind (Model~F). \n\nIn the first case (Model~D: with magnetosphere; see\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}), the agreement of the continuum \nvisibilities with the AMBER observation is excellent, but large\ndisagreements in the line profile shape (as in\nSections~\\ref{subsub:line-MA-model} and \\ref{subsub:line-DW-model}) and the\ndifferential phases in the line can be seen. \nThe angular size of the magnetosphere is about 0.15\\,mas; hence, it is\nunresolved by the interferometer. There is a slight indication\nfor a depression in the visibility level at the line centre due to the\nmagnetospheric absorption. The photo-centre shifts due to the\npresence of the magnetosphere are very small on all baselines; hence,\nthere is no change in the differential phases within the line.  This\n clearly disagrees with the observed differential phases which show\n S-shape signals across the line for two baselines. Similarly, the\n model closure phases are essentially zero across the line due to the\nsmall angular size of the magnetosphere, which is consistent with\nthe observations within in their large error bars ($\\sim \\pm 20^{\\circ}$ as\nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}). \n\nIn the second case (Model~E: with a disc wind; see\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}), the agreement of the differential phases\nwith the observation is excellent. This indicates that the disc wind\nmodel used here is reasonable. Main disagreements are seen in the line\nstrength and the visibility levels for the longest project\nbaseline (88\\,m: UT2-UT4). The model Br$\\gamma$ line profile is slightly too strong\ncompared to the observed one, and the continuum visibility level for\nthe longest baseline in the model is too low compared to the\nobservation.  If we adopt a smaller ring size, the visibility levels\nfor the longest baseline would increase, but the line strength (with\nrespect to the continuum) would also increase.  Hence, the disagreement\nin the line profiles would also increase unless we decrease the line\nstrength by decreasing, for example, the disc wind mass-loss rate\n($\\dot{M_{\\mathrm{dw}}}$). \nThe situation can be improved if there is an additional \ncontinuum emission component which is more compact than the ring\ncontinuum emission. For example, the continuum emission from the\nmagnetosphere as in the first case (Model D) will make the line weaker\nand make the visibility slightly larger.  A small S-shape variation in\nclosure phases across the line is seen in the model due to the\nnon-spherical symmetric nature of the disc wind emission. The\namplitude of the variation is relatively small ($\\sim 7^{\\circ}$), and\nit does not disagree with the data which have rather large error bars\n($\\sim \\pm 20^{\\circ}$ as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}).\n\n\n\nIn the third case, the model (Model~F: with a magnetosphere and disc\nwind; see Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}) fits all the observed\ninterferometric quantities, including the line profile, very well.\nThis is our best case of the three models. In particular, the model\nsimultaneously reproduces the following characteristics in the\nobserved interferometric data: (1)~the double-peak Br$\\gamma$ profile,\n(1)~the double-peak variation of the visibilities across the line\n(especially for the longest project baseline), (3)~the S-shape\nvariations of the differential phases across the line, and (4)~the\nsmall amplitude in the variation of the closure phases across the\nline.  The locations of the peaks in the visibilities curves are\napproximately $\\pm 50\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$, which corresponds to the two peaks in\nthe line profile. The line emission maps shown earlier\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image}) also suggests that the extent of the line\nemission from the disc wind is largest at these velocities.\n\nIn summary, our radiative transfer model (Model~F in\nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}), which uses a combination of a \nsmall magnetosphere and a disc wind with its inner radius\nat the outer radius of the magnetosphere, is in good agreement with\nthe observed interferometric data for HD~58647. The extent of the\nline-emitting disc wind region (the outer radius \nof the intensity distribution $\\sim0.5$~au as in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image}) is slightly smaller \nthan the K-band continuum-emitting ring size\n($R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=23.5\\,R_{*}$ or 0.68~au) which approximately \ncorresponds to the dust sublimation radius of the system. \n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion }\n\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Continuum-emitting regions}\n\\label{sub:discuss-cont-region}\n\nIn Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}, we used a simple geometrical model\n(an elongated ring) and the observed continuum\nvisibilities to estimate the size of the K-band continuum-emitting\nregion. The angular radius of the ring emission was estimated as\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=2.0$~mas  or equivalently\n0.64~au at the distance of 318~pc (VL07)\n(Table~\\ref{tab:ring-fit-param}). This radius is \nslightly larger than the value obtained by MO05, i.e.\\,$1.47$~mas.\nHowever, their radius determination does not include the effect of ring\nelongation/inclination because the $uv$-coverage of the Keck\nInterferometer in MO05 provides almost no two-dimensional\ninformation.  Further, the ring radius estimated in\nSection~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit} \n(0.64~au) is slightly smaller than the value used in the radiative\ntransfer models (Table~\\ref{tab:model-param}),\ni.e.\\,$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.68$~au. \nThe larger continuum radius is used in the radiative transfer model to\nreproduced the observed visibilities because of the additional compact\ncontinuum emission from the magnetosphere, which is not \nincluded in the geometric model in Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}. \n\nAssuming a dust sublimation temperature of 1500~K and the stellar luminosity\nof  $L_{*}=412\\,{\\mathrm{L_{\\sun}}}$ \n(Section~\\ref{subsub:adopted-param}), the size-luminosity\nrelationship in MO05 provides a dust sublimation radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{s}}$ of $0.64$~au. \nThis is very similar to the ring radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.68$~au used in the radiative transfer model\n(Model~F), which fits our AMBER continuum visibility observation\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}). \n\n\n\\subsection{Disc wind launching regions}\n\\label{sub:discuss-line-region}\nAccording to the disc wind model (Model~F), which fits the\nspectro-interferometric observation in Section~\\ref{sub:model-vis}\nwell, the inner radius of the disc-wind launching region ($R_\\mathrm{wi}$)\nis only 0.05~au, which is located just outside of the \nmagnetosphere.  This radius is much smaller than the dust sublimation radius\n($R_\\mathrm{s}$), which is approximately equal to the radius of the\ncontinuum-emitting geometrical ring $R_{\\mathrm{ring}}=0.68$~au, as\nshown in the previous section. Next, we compare the size of the inner\nradius of the disc-wind launching region of our HD~58647 model with\nthose found in earlier studies of other Herbig Ae/Be stars, in which\nthe VLTI-AMBER in the high spectral \nresolution mode and radiative transfer models for\nBr$\\gamma$ were used. Only three such studies are available in the\nliterature: the Herbig Be star MWC~297 (\\citealt{Weigelt:2011}), the\nHerbig Ae star MWC~275 (\\citealt{GarciaLopez:2015}) and the Herbig Be\nstar HD~98922 (\\citealt{Caratti:2015}). These studies used similar\nkinematic disc wind models to probe the wind-launching region of these\nstars. Fig.~\\ref{fig:compare-sizes}\nshows the inner radii of the disc wind launching regions plotted as a\nfunction of stellar luminosity (see also\nTable~\\ref{tab:amber-hr-sizes}).\\footnote{\\citet{Benisty:2010},\n  \\citet{Kraus:2012b}, \n  \\citet{Ellerbroek:2015} and \\citet{Mendigutia:2015} presented the high spectral resolution \nVLTI-AMBER observations of Z~CMa, V921 Sco, HD~50138 and HD~100564, respectively;\nhowever, their observations were not analysed with a radiative\ntransfer model with a disc wind. Hence, we excluded their\nresults from this analysis.} The figure shows that the inner radius of\nthe wind launching region \nincreases as the luminosity increases.

The difference between\nthe wind-launching region of MWC~297 and those of the lower\nluminosity stars may be caused by the difference in the strength of \nstellar and/or disc radiation (pressure) which may influence the\nwind launching radius and wind dynamics (e.g.~\\citealt{Drew:1997};\n\\citealt*{Proga:1999}).   \n\n\nThe physical origin of the relation in \nequation~\\ref{eq:dw-inner-radius} is unknown.

The cause of\nthe increase in $R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$ from the three stars with lower\nluminosities (MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647) to MWC~297 is even more\nuncertain since the stellar radius of MWC~297 is not significantly\nlarger than the others.\n\n\nAnother difference between MWC~297 and the other three stars in our\nsample can be found in their K-band continuum emission\nradii.

While the\nring radii of MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647 follow the expected\nsize-luminosity relation, that of MWC~297 falls below the expected\nvalue for the dust sublimation temperature of 1500~K. The continuum\nring radius is about 10 times larger than the inner radius of the disc\nwind in MWC~275, HD~98922 and HD~58647, but it is only 1.1 times\nlarger for the luminous MWC~297.  The tendency for the high luminosity\nHerbig Be stars ($L_{*}>10^{3}\\,{\\mathrm{L_{\\sun}}}$) to have an `undersized' dust\nsublimation radius is pointed out by MO05. They suggest that the\ninnermost gas accretion disc might be optically thick for luminous\nHerbig Be stars, and it partially blocks the stellar radiation on to\nthe disc, hence causing a smaller dust sublimation radius (see also\n\\citealt{Eisner:2004}).\n\n\nThe outflow, from which the observed\nBr$\\gamma$ emission line originates, is most likely formed in\nmagnetohydrodynamical processes, in either (1)~magneto-centrifugal disc\nwind (e.g.~\\citealt{blandford:1982,ouyed:1997,krasnopolsky:2003}) or\n(2)~a wind launched near the disc-magnetosphere interaction region\n(e.g.~an X-wind -- \\citealt{shu:1994,Shu:1995} or a conical wind --\n\\citealt{Romanova:2009}).  The (accretion-powered) stellar wind \n(e.g.~\\citealt{decampli:1981, hartmann:1982, Strafella:1998,\n  matt:2005, Cranmer:2009}) is unlikely the origin of Br$\\gamma$\nemission line in the case of HD~58647 because the line computed with such a wind\nwould have a single-peaked profile while the observed Br$\\gamma$ is\ndouble-peaked with its peak separation of $\\sim160\\,{\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}).  Our radiative transfer model uses a\nsimple disc wind plus a compact magnetosphere, and we have\ndemonstrated that this model is able to\nreproduce the interferometric observation with the VLTI-AMBER\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}). However, the disc wind in this\nmodel could also resemble the flows found in the conical wind and X-wind\nmodels, in which  the mass ejection region is also   \nconcentrated just outside of a magnetosphere.  \nThis is because the inner radius of the disc wind model (Model~F in \nTable~\\ref{tab:model-param}) is also located just outside of \nthe magnetosphere. Further, the\nlocal mass-loss rate ($\\dot{m}$, the mass-loss rate per\nunit area) on the accretion disc in our model is a strong\nfunction of $w$ (the distance from the star on the accretion disc\nplane), i.e. $\\dot{m} \\propto w^{-2.4}$. Thus, the mass-loss flux is\n concentrated just outside of the magnetosphere as in the conical\nand X-wind models. It would be difficult to exclude the conical or X-wind as a\npossible outflow model in this case. Only when the inner radius of the\nwind launching region is significantly larger than the corotation\nradius of a star (as in MWC~297, Table~\\ref{tab:amber-hr-sizes}), they\ncould be safely excluded.   \n\nFinally, the rate of angular momentum loss by the disc wind\n($\\dot{J}_{\\mathrm{dw}}$) can be directly calculated in our model\n(Models~E and F) because we adopted the explicit forms of the\nmass-loss rate per unit area and the wind velocity law\n(Section~\\ref{subsub:DW-config}).  In the context of a\nmagneto-centrifugal disc wind model, the specific angular momentum\n($j$) transported along each magnetic field line can be written as\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n     j = \\left(r_{\\mathrm{A}}/r_{0}\\right)^2 \\, j_{0}\n     \\label{eq:specific-angular-momentum}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"j=\\left(r_{\\mathrm{A}}/r_{0}\\right)^{2}\\,j_{0}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>j</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02209.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $j_{\\mathrm{wo}}$ is the specific angular momentum of the gas at\nthe disc wind outer radius $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}$\n(e.g.~\\citealt{Pudritz:1999}).

Hence, the ratio $\\dot{J}_{\\mathrm{dw}} /\n\\dot{J}_{\\mathrm{disc}}$ is about 0.58. Interestingly, this is very\nsimilar to the ratio found by \\citet{Bacciotti:2002} in the\nobservation of the classical T Tauri star DG~Tau. \n\nOur model suggests that about 60~per~cent of the angular momentum loss\nrate is in the disc wind.

For example, the spectroscopic study of HD~58647 by\n\\citet{Mendigutia:2011} shows a hint for an inverse P-Cygni profile\nor a redshifted absorption component in {{He}$\\,${\\sc {{i}}}}~5876~\\AA{}, which\nmight be formed in a magnetospheric accretion funnel. Interestingly, a\nrecent spectroscopic survey of Herbig Ae/Be stars by\n\\citet{Cauley:2015} has shown that about 14~per~cent of their samples\nexhibit the inverse P-Cygni profile in {{He}$\\,${\\sc {{i}}}}~5876~\\AA{} (see\nalso \\citealt{Cauley:2014}). Further, the spectropolarimetic (linear)\nobservation of H$\\alpha$ in HD~58647 by \\citet{Vink:2002}, \\citet{Mottram:2007}\nand \\citet{Harrington:2009} show a large polarization change in the\nline and the pattern on the Stokes parameter $QU$ plane is a loop ---\nindicating that a part of H$\\alpha$ emission is intrinsically\npolarized and the emission is scattered by the gas with a flattened\ngeometry.  A similar pattern on the $QU$ plane are also seen in the\nclassical T Tauri stars and Herbig Ae stars.  \\citet{Mottram:2007}\nsuggested that the intrinsically polarized H$\\alpha$ (at least\npartially) originates from a magnetosphere.  Lastly, a recent\nspectropolarimetric observation by \\citet{Hubrig:2013} showed\nthat the star has a mean longitudinal magnetic field with strength\n<$B_{z}$>=$218\\pm69$~G, supporting a possible presence of a\nmagnetosphere in HD~58647.\n\nBased on these evidences, a magnetosphere with a small radius was\nintroduced in the radiative transfer models for the Br$\\gamma$\nline profile and the interferometric data\n(Sections~\\ref{sub:model-line-prof} and \\ref{sub:model-vis}). In\nSections~\\ref{sub:model-line-prof}, we found that the small\nmagnetosphere does not significantly contribute to the Br$\\gamma$ line\nemission (Fig.~\\ref{fig:ma-tm-effect}).  On the other hand, we find\nthe disc wind is the main contributor for the Br$\\gamma$ emission in\nHD~58647 (Fig.~\\ref{fig:compare-ma-dw}). Since the mass-accretion rate\nof HD~58647 is relatively high ($\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}=3.5\\times\n10^{-7}\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$, \\citealt{Brittain:2007}), it may contribute a\nnon-negligible amount of continuum flux in the K-band. For example, in\nModel~F, approximately 10~per~cent of the total continuum flux is from the\nmagnetosphere. This has at least two consequences: (1)~the normalized\nline profile will be slightly weaker because of the larger total\ncontinuum flux (Fig.~\\ref{fig:compare-ma-dw}), and (2)~the continuum\nvisibilities would be larger since the magnetosphere is \nunresolved (its continuum emission is compact)\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}).  In other words, we might\nslightly underestimate e.g. the disc wind mass-loss rate if a magnetosphere\nis not included in the model since it would produce a slightly stronger line\n(due to a weaker continuum). We might also slightly underestimate \nthe size for the continuum-emitting ring when the magnetosphere is not\nincluded in the model. A slightly larger ring size is needed to balance\nthe increase in the visibility due to the emission from the magnetosphere.\n\nOne can estimate the dipolar magnetic field strength of HD\\,58647 at the magnetic \nequator ($B_{*}$) using the standard relation between the\ndipole magnetic field strength and stellar parameters found in\n\\citet{Koenigl:1991} and \\citet*{Johns-Krull:1999}, i.e.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nB_{*} & = & K\n            \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{0.35}\\right)^{7/6}\n            \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{0.5}\\right)^{-7/4}\n            \\left(\\frac{M_{*}}{{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}}}}\\right)^{5/6} \\\\\n      &   & \\times\\left(\\frac{\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}}{10^{-7}\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}}\\right)^{1/2}\n            \\left(\\frac{R_{*}}{{\\mathrm{R_{\\sun}}}}\\right)^{-3}\n            \\left(\\frac{P_{*}}{1.0\\,\\mathrm{d}}\\right)^{7/6}\n\\label{eq:konigl}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $K$ is a constant: $3.43\\times10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{G}$. The\nparameters $\\beta$ and $\\epsilon$ represent the efficiency of the\ncoupling between the stellar magnetic field and the inner regions of\nthe disc, and the ratio of the stellar angular velocity to the\nKeplerian angular velocity at the inner radius of a magnetosphere,\nrespectively. Here, we adopt $\\beta=0.5$ and $\\epsilon=0.35$, as in\n\\citet{Koenigl:1991} and \\citet{Johns-Krull:1999}. By using the\nstellar parameters used in our model (Table~\\ref{tab:stellar-param})\nin equation~\\ref{eq:konigl}, we find $B_{*} = 240$\\,G. This is very\nsimilar to the mean longitudinal magnetic field strength\n<$B_{z}$>=$218\\pm69$~G found in the spectropolarimetric\nobservations of HD~58647 by \\citet{Hubrig:2013}.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Keplerian disc as a main source of Br$\\gamma$ emission?}\n\\label{sub:discuss-kdisc}\n\nSo far, we have argued that the double-peaked Br$\\gamma$ emission line\nprofile seen in HD~58647 is mainly formed in a disc wind, which\nis rotating near Keplerian velocity at the base of the wind. The model\nwith a disc wind and a magnetosphere (Model~F in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}) was also able to reproduce the\ninterferometric observations by VLTI-AMBER. \nHowever, the double-peaked Br$\\gamma$ line profile could be also\nformed in a gaseous Keplerian disc (without a disc wind), as often\ndemonstrated in the models for (more evolved) classical Be stars\n(e.g.\\,\\citealt{Carciofi:2008, Kraus:2012c, Meilland:2012,\n  Rivinius:2013}). In addition, we find \nthat the emission maps computed for different velocity channels across\nBr$\\gamma$ shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image} is rather similar to those\ncomputed with a simple Keplerian disc (e.g.\\,\\citealt{Kraus:2012c}; \\citealt{Mendigutia:2015}). \nThe similarity naturally occurs because the Br$\\gamma$ emission in our\ndisc wind model arises mainly from near the base of the wind where the\nKeplerian rotation of the wind is dominating over the poloidal motion.\nFor this reason, it would be difficult to exclude a simple Keplerian disc\nas a main source of the Br$\\gamma$ emission in HD~58647 based\nsolely on our VLTI-AMBER observations.  \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:rho-vel-base} shows the poloidal and azimuthal velocity\ncomponents of the disc wind at its base for Model~F, plotted as a\nfunction of the distance from the symmetric/rotation axis. The\ncorresponding density at the base of the disc wind is also shown in\nthe same figure as a reference.  In our model, the poloidal speed of\nthe disc wind ($v_{\\mathrm{p}}$) is set by\nequation~\\ref{eq:discwind-poloidal-velocity} in\nSection~\\ref{subsub:DW-config}. The poloidal speed of the wind at its\nbase can be found by setting $l=0$ in the equation, i.e.\n$v_{\\mathrm{p}}(w_{i}, l=0) = c_{\\mathrm{s}}(w_{i})$ where\n$c_{\\mathrm{s}}(w_{i})$ the local sound speed, and $w_{i}$ is the\ndistance from the symmetry/rotation axis. Hence, the poloidal speed at\nthe base of the wind is equal to the local sound speed. The sound\nspeed at the inner disc wind launching radius\n($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}=1.7\\,R_{*}$) is about 4\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ (assuming\n$T\\sim2000$\\,K as in \\citealt{Muzerolle:2004}).  This is significantly\nsmaller than the (wind) Keplerian speed at the same location,\ni.e. 289\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$. Although not shown here, as a simple test, we\ncomputed Br$\\gamma$ line profiles using exactly the same density\ndistribution as in Model F (magnetosphere + disc wind), but with\n$v_{\\mathrm{p}}$ manually boosted by a constant factor to examine how\nlarge $v_{\\mathrm{p}}$ should be for the Br$\\gamma$ line profile to\nshow a line asymmetry or a deviation from the Keplerian velocity\ndominated Br$\\gamma$ line profile seen in Model~F. In this experiment,\nwe found that the Br$\\gamma$ line profile started to show the effect\nof $v_{\\mathrm{p}}$ when it was boosted by a factor of $\\sim 5$. The\ncorresponding $v_{\\mathrm{p}}$ at the base of the wind at the inner\nwind radius ($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$) is about 25\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$.  In the original\ndisc wind velocity distribution (without the boosting factor),\n$v_{\\mathrm{p}}$ can reach 25\\,${\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}}$ at about 2\\,$R_{*}$ away from\nthe wind launching point along the streamline emerging from the inner\ndisc wind radius ($R_{\\mathrm{wi}}$). If the Br$\\gamma$ emission\nmainly arose from this region or a location farther away from the\nlaunching point, we would be able to see the effect of the poloidal\nvelocity. However, this is not the case for our model (Model~F),\ni.e. the Br$\\gamma$ emission seems to originate much closer to the\ndisc surface.\n\n\nAs seen in Section~\\ref{subsub:line-DW-model}, to produce a Br$\\gamma$\nemission line with its strength comparable to the one seen in the\nobservation, the temperature of the gas must be rather high ($\\sim\n10^{4}$\\,K) and the emission volume must be sufficiently large. In the\nstudy of thermal properties of Keplerian discs (without a disc wind)\naround classical Be star, \\citet{Carciofi:2006} showed that the gas\ntemperature in the upper layers of discs could reach $\\sim 10^{4}$\\,K,\nalthough they considered stars with $T_\\mathrm{eff}=19000$\\,K which is\nmuch higher than that for HD~58647 ($T_\\mathrm{eff}=10500$\\,K,\nTable~\\ref{tab:stellar-param}). It is uncertain if the same\nmodel is applicable to HD~58647 and if it can produce gas with high\nenough temperature ($\\sim 10^{4}$\\,K) using the stellar parameters of\nHD~58647. Furthermore, in the study of the thermal property of gaseous\ndiscs irradiated by Herbig Ae/Be stars,\n\\citet{Muzerolle:2004} found the gas temperatures in the upper\nlayers of accretion discs were relatively low ($\\sim$2000\\,K). This\nis certainly too low for the formation of a Br$\\gamma$ emission line. \nOn the other hand, the disc wind gas has favorable conditions for Br$\\gamma$\nemission because of the acceleration and heating of the gas in\nthe disc wind by e.g.~ambipolar diffusion (e.g.~\\citealt{Safier:1993};\n\\citealt{Garcia:2001}) and internal jet shocks (e.g.~\\citealt{Staff:2010}),\nwhich can bring the temperature to $\\sim 10^{4}$\\,K.    \n\nTo compute the emission line profiles from a Keplerian disc\nwith self-consistent density and temperature structures (by\nconsidering hydrostatic and radiative equilibriums), we would need a\nmajor change in our model. This is beyond the scope of this paper;\nhowever, it should be investigated in the future in detail. Only \nthen, we would be able to address the issue of distinguishing\ninterferometric signatures of a disc wind from those of a simple\nKeplerian disc. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\n  \\includegraphics[clip,width=0.45\\textwidth]{fig10.pdf}\n\n\n\\caption{ A comparison of the velocity components (upper panel) and\n  density (lower panel) at the base of the disc wind model used in\n  Model~F.

The\nhigh spectral resolution of AMBER provides us many spectral channels across the line to\ninvestigate the wind origin and properties of HD~58647\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-summary}).  The star displays\ndouble peaks in Br$\\gamma$ and in the wavelength-dependent visibility\ncurves. The differential phase curves show S-shaped variations around\nthe line centre. \n\nBased on a simple geometrical ring fit for the continuum\nvisibilities (Fig.~\\ref{fig:ring-fit}), we find the K-band\ncontinuum-emitting ring size is around 2.0~mas, which corresponds to\n0.64~au at the distance of 318~pc (VL07). The visibility level\nincreases in the line (by $\\sim 0.1$) for the longest project baseline\n(88\\,m), indicating that the extent of the Br$\\gamma$ emission region\nis smaller than the size of the continuum-emitting region, which is\nexpected to arise near the \ndust sublimation radius of the accretion disc. \n\nThe interferometric data have been analysed using radiative transfer\nmodels to study the geometry, size and physical properties of the\nwind.  The double-peaked line profile and the pattern of the\ndifferential phase curves (S-shaped) suggest that the line-emitting\ngas is rotating.  We find that a model with a small magnetosphere with\nouter radius $R_{\\mathrm{mo}}=1.7\\,R_{*}$ plus a disc wind with the\ninner radius located just outside of the magnetosphere and outer\nradius $R_{\\mathrm{wo}}=22.5\\,R_{*}$ (Model~F) can fit the observed\nBr$\\gamma$ profile, wavelength-dependent visibilities, differential\nand closure phases, simultaneously\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}). The model has shown that the radial\nextent of the Br$\\gamma$ emission in the disc wind is about 0.5~au\nwhile the inner radius of the K-band continuum-emitting ring is about\n0.68~au (Fig.~\\ref{fig:vel-image}).  The slightly larger size of the\ncontinuum ring emission, compared to the one obtained in the simple\ngeometrical model (Section~\\ref{sec:ring-model-fit}), is found in the\nradiative transfer model because it includes the continuum emission\nfrom the compact magnetosphere ($\\sim$\\,10~per~cent of the total\nK-band flux).  The mass-accretion and mass-loss rates adopted for the\nmodel are $3.5\\times10^{-7}$ and $4.5\\times10^{-8}\\,{\\mathrm{M_{\\sun}\\,yr^{-1}}}$,\nrespectively ($\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{dw}}/\\dot{M}_{\\mathrm{a}}=0.13$).  \nConsequently, about 60~per~cent of the angular momentum loss\nrate required for a steady accretion with the measured\naccretion rate is provide by the disc wind\n(Section~\\ref{sub:discuss-line-region}). \n\nWe find that the small magnetosphere does not\ncontribute significantly to the Br$\\gamma$ line emission significantly\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:compare-ma-dw}).  The size of the innermost radius in\nthe disc wind model (Model F) was compared with those from the earlier\nstudies Herbig Ae/Be stars with high spectral resolution VLTI-AMBER\nobservations (\\citealt{Weigelt:2011, GarciaLopez:2015,Caratti:2015}).\nWe found a trend that the inner radius of the wind-launching region\nincreases as the luminosity of a star increases\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:compare-sizes}). \n\nWhile the model with a disc wind plus magnetosphere (Model~F) showed\nthe best fit to the interferometric observations\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:amber-model-best}), the disc wind only model (Model E)\ncould be improved to fit the observations (in particular the\nvisibility levels for the longest baseline) by using a smaller\ncontinuum ring radius and by adjusting other model parameters\naccordingly. Hence, the model proposed here (Model~F) is not necessary\na unique fit to the observations. \n\n\nAs briefly mentioned in Section~\\ref{sub:discuss-line-region}, the\nAMBER observation could be also explained by the conical wind\n(e.g.~\\citealt{Romanova:2009}) or X-wind (e.g.~\\citealt{shu:1994})\nmodels because the disc wind model that fits the AMBER observation has\nan inner radius comparable to the size of the magnetosphere, and its\nmass-loss is also concentrated near the disc-magnetosphere interaction\nregion, as in the conical and X-wind models.\nHowever, the X-wind model alone might have a difficulty in explaining\nthe rate of the angular momentum loss required for a steady accretion\nin the Keplerian disc (Section~\\ref{sub:discuss-line-region}).\nAlso, as mentioned in Section~\\ref{sub:discuss-kdisc}, we still\ncannot exclude a simple Keplerian disc model as \na main source of the Br$\\gamma$ emission in HD~58647 since the model\ncould produce a double-peaked Br$\\gamma$ emission line and could\nproduce similar velocity-dependent emission maps to those computed\nwith a disc wind (Fig~\\ref{fig:vel-image}). \n\nIn the future, we need a systematic study to find how the\ninterferometric signatures differ in different outflow models, perhaps\nby using the results of MHD simulations.  \nTo improve our understanding of the wind properties\n(e.g.~temperature), it would be useful to combine the interferometric\nobservations with high-resolution spectroscopic observations. \nSimultaneous fitting of multiple emission lines in the spectroscopic\nobservations would provide us tighter constrains on the physical\nproperties of the gas in the wind.  To improve the interferometric data,\nwe would need higher signal-to-noise data under good\nseeing condition and a larger coverage on the $uv$ plane.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\n\nWe thank the anonymous referee who provided us insightful comments and\nsuggestions which helped improving the manuscript.\nWe thank the ESO support astronomer Dr.~W.\\,J.\\,M.~de Wit for his\nassistance during our observation.
