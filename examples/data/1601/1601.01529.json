The sub-Keplerian inflow does not form a rotationally supported accretion disk, but it rather reaches the accreting object from a wide solid angle.  The basic ingredients of the flow are a turbulent region where the accretion belt interacts with the accreting object via a shear layer, and two avoidance regions on the poles where the accretion rate is very low.\nA dynamo that is developed in the shear layer amplifies magnetic fields to high values. It is likely that the amplified magnetic fields form polar outflows from the avoidance regions. Our speculative belt-launched jets model has implications to a rich variety of astrophysical objects, from the removal of common envelopes to the explosion of core collapse supernovae by jittering jets.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{INTRODUCTION}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\n\nJets are known to be launched by accretion disks around compact\nobjects, such as super-massive black holes in active galactic\nnuclei, X-ray binaries, young stellar objects (YSOs), and in\nplanetary nebulae (PNe; e.g., \\citealt{Livio2011}). Many jet\nlaunching models are based on the operation of large scale\nmagnetic fields, i.e., those with coherence scale larger than the\nradius of the disk at the considered location (e.g.,\n\\citealt{ZanniFerreira2013} and \\citealt{Narayanetal2014} and\nreferences therein). Some models do not rely on the magnetic\nfields of the accreting compact object, but rather  assume an\noutflow from an extended disk region with large-scale magnetic\nfields (e.g., \\citealt{KoniglPudritz2000, Shuetal2000,\nFerreira2002, Krasnopolskyetal2003, FerreiraCasse2004}).\n\nHowever, there are several arguments hinting that jets can be\nlaunched without the presence of large scale disk magnetic fields.\n(1) There are well collimated jets in PNe, such as in Hen~2-90\n\\citep{SahaiNyman2000}. No large scale magnetic fields are\nexpected around the companion to the AGB star that is though to\nlaunch the jets in PNe. (2) DQ Her (intermediate polars) systems\nare cataclysmic variables where the accreting white dwarf (WD) has\na sufficiently strong magnetic field to truncate the accretion\ndisk close to the WD. Such a stellar-disk magnetic field geometry\nis assumed in some jet-launching models in YSOs (e.g.,\n\\citealt{Shuetal1991}). Despite that, no jets are observed in DQ\nHer systems. (3) The strong dynamo that operates in accretion\ndisks is likely to modify the structure of the large scale\nmagnetic fields, (e.g. \\citealt{Hujeiratetal2003}). (4)\n\\cite{Ferreira2013} concluded that steady state jets' launching\nmodels cannot spin down a protostar. The balance between the\nspinning-up accretion torque and the spinning-down magnetic torque\nin such models is expected to spin up the star on a time scale\nsmaller than the disk lifetime. Observations, on the other hand,\nshow that the rotation period of some YSOs is almost constant, at\nroughly $10 \\%$ of their break-up speed. In contrast, unsteady\nmodels are better candidates for the removal of energy and angular\nmomentum from the disk. The model studied in the present paper is\na type of unsteady model. (5) In several YSOs the jets precess on\na time scale of about 100 years (e.g. \\citealt{Ybarraetal2006}),\nmuch too rapid for a large scale magnetic field to change its\ngeometry. Models that lunch jets from close to the accreting\ncompact object might allow for such a rapid precession.\n\nIn the present study we examine cases where the accreted gas has a\nsub-Keplerian angular momentum, and hence cannot form a fully\ndeveloped Keplerian accretion disk around the compact object.\nInstead, the gas that does posses a non-negligible specific\nangular momentum forms an accretion belt on the surface of the\naccreting body. We aim at two cases in particular: (1) The case\nwhere a main sequence (MS) star is spiraling-in inside the envelope of\na giant star. The MS star can accrete mass from the\nenvelope at a rate of the order of the Eddington limit. The\nspecific angular momentum of the accreted gas, $j_{\\rm acc}$, might be in many\ncases below that required to form a Keplerian accretion disk\naround the MS star, $j_{\\rm Kep}$, but still be non-negligible $j_{\\rm acc} \\approx 0.1-1 j_{\\rm Kep}$ \\citep{Soker2004}. (2) An accretion by the newly born NS in core\ncollapse supernovae (CCSNe). In some CCSNe the accreted gas might\npossess a rapidly varying non-negligible value of the specific\nangular momentum, but not sufficient to form a Keplerian accretion\ndisk \\citep{GilkisSoker2015, GilkisSoker2016, Papishetal2016}.\nBoth scenarios are most difficult for observational validation.\n\nIncorporating ingredients from accretion disks formed at high accretion rates we build the belt-launched jets model. The basic ingredients of the model are described in section \\ref{sec:ingredients}, and the dynamo is discussed in section \\ref{sec:dynamo}. The implications for some specific astrophysical objects are discussed in section \\ref{sec:summary} that also contains our summery.\n\n\n\\section{BASIC INGREDIENTS}\n\\label{sec:ingredients}\n\n\nA geometrically-thin Keplerian accretion disk is connected to the\naccreting body, if it is not a black hole and if the accreting body magnetic field\nis not too strong, via a thin high-shear layer termed the boundary\nlayer (e.g., \\citealt{Regev1983, RegevBertout1995}). The\nmatter in the boundary layer expands to higher latitudes along the\nsurface of the accreting body. \\cite{InogamovSunyaev1999} built a\nmodel for cases of high accretion rates onto neutron stars (NS), and\nproposed that the meridional spreading brings the accreted mass\nclose to the poles. In that model the luminosity from the\nspreading-layer, or belt, reaches a maximum away from the\nequatorial plane. The accreted gas spins-down to the rotation\nvelocity of the accreting body through a turbulent friction that\nexists in the spreading-layer \\citep{InogamovSunyaev1999,\nInogamovSunyaev2010}. This type of flow is depicted in the right\nside of Fig. \\ref{fig:flow1}. The left half-side of Fig.\n\\ref{fig:flow1} schematically presents the flow structure proposed\nin the present study.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{Accretionbeltfig1}\n\n\\caption{The flow structure studied here is presented schematically in the left half of the figure. It has some similarities with the spreading-layer that was proposed by \\citep{InogamovSunyaev1999} that is presented on the right half.

We study MS stars\naccreting at very high rates, a process that is different than\naccretion onto a NS. For example, radiation pressure might not be\nas important as in accretion onto a NS. In the flow structure onto\na newly born NS in CCSNe, cooling is mainly via neutrinos, and not\nby photon emission. The flow structures we discuss here are more\ncomplicated, and 3D numerical studies will be required to simulate\nsuch flows.

For the gas energy density we take $\\rho v^2_{\\rm esc}/2$, where $v_{\\rm esc}$ is the escape velocity from the star\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac {B^2/4 \\pi }{e_{\\rm gas}} \\approx 0.2   q\n\\left( \\frac {\\Omega_{\\rm belt}/\\Omega_{\\rm Kep}}{0.3} \\right)^2\n\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_{\\rm belt}}{N}\\right)^{1/4}\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{r^2N}\\right)^{1/4} .\n\\label{eq:Bscaled}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs stated, this is for the non-turbulence part of the accretion belt. As turbulence is expected in the strongly sheared belt, the amplification can be more efficient event. We conclude that a fraction of $\\approx {\\rm few} \\times 0.1$ of the accreted energy is channelled to magnetic energy. In our proposed scenario the magnetic field lines are further winded and stretched by the rotating belt as they are dragged by the outflowing gas. The magnetic field reconnect and launch jets.\n\nIn claiming that an efficient dynamo can be operate in the accretion belt we are encouraged by the recent results of \\cite{Mostaetal2015} who conducted very high resolution simulations of CCSNe with pre-collpase rapidly rotating cores. They show that rapidly rotating material around the newly born NS can amplify tremendously an initial magnetic field, and leads to jets lunching.\nIn their simulations the turbulent kinetic energy in the accreted gas is converted into electromagnetic energy. The timescale for an e-fold increase in the magnetic field in the accretion disk, $\\tau_e \\approx 0.5 {~\\rm ms}$, is about half an orbital period in the relevant part of the disk. Interestingly, only very-high resolution simulations were able to demonstrate the tremendous magnetic field amplification. These results are very supportive for the jittering-jets model for the explosion of all CCSNe with explosion energies of $\\ga 2 \\times 10^{50} {~\\rm erg}$.\n\nIntermittent accretion belts in CCSNe are expected to last for a time of $\\tau_b \\approx 0.03-0.1 {~\\rm s}$, equals to tens of Keplerian orbits at $\\sim 25 {~\\rm km} $ from the NS. A belt with a specific angular momentum of $\\eta \\equiv j_{\\rm acc}/j_{\\rm Kep}$ has an orbital period on the equator of the newly born NS of $\\approx 30 (\\eta/0.05)^{-1} {~\\rm ms}$. Closer to the poles the period will be shorter. This shows that the sub-Keplerian disk has sufficient time to substantially amplify the magnetic fields. We conjecture that the strong magnetic fields with the preferred axis of rotation and the avoidance angle (eq. \\ref{eq:limitangle}), lead to the launching of two opposite jets in the polar directions, where the ram pressure of the accreted gas is very low.\n\n\n\\section{DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY}\n \\label{sec:summary}\n\n\nWe conducted a preliminary study that led us to argue that sub-Keplerian accretion flows onto compact objects can launch jets. The sub-Keplerian accreted gas forms an accretion belt rather than an accretion disk (left half side of Fig. \\ref{fig:flow1}). Within the avoidance angle $\\theta_a$ from the polar directions (eq. \\ref{eq:limitangle}) the accretion rate is very low. The dynamo amplification of the magnetic field within the belt (section \\ref{sec:dynamo}) can lead to very strong magnetic fields, as can be seen from equation (\\ref{eq:Bscaled}) that gives the ratio of the amplified magnetic field energy density to that in the accreted gas.\n\nWe speculate that reconnection of the magnetic field lines can lead to an outflow through the two opposite polar avoidance regions. Winding of the magnetic field lines frozen to the polar outflow  can further channel rotation energy to outflow kinetic energy.\nThe main differences and common properties of the proposed belt-launched jets scenario from those of the common disk-launched jets are presented in Table 1.\n\nOur conclusion is that accretion belts that are formed by sub-Keplerian accretion flows might lunch jets. If true, these results might have far reaching implications for the removal of common envelopes by jets. Numerical studies point at a limited efficiency of the common envelope removal by the gravitational energy released during the spiraling-in process (e.g.,\n\\citealt{DeMarco2011, Passyetal2012, RickerTaam2012, Ohlmannetal2015}).\nIt has been suggested that jets can assist it removing the common envelope (e.g. \\citealt{Soker2014}). However, the specific angular momentum of the gas accreted by a MS star spiraling-in inside a giant envelope is sub-Keplerian $j_{\\rm acc} \\approx 0.1-1 j_{\\rm Kep}$  \\citep{Soker2004}. A belt is expected to be formed around the MS star during the\ncommon envelope phase. Jets that might be launched by the belt, as argued in the present study, can assist in removing the common envelope.\n\nAs well, our results might have implication to CCSNe explosion scenarios. The neutrino-delayed mechanism has severe problems in accounting for explosions with kinetic energy of more than about\n$2-5 \\times 10^{50} {~\\rm erg}$ \\citep{Papishetal2015}. An intermittent accretion belt is expected to be formed around the newly born NS during the first several seconds of the explosion\n\\citep{GilkisSoker2015, GilkisSoker2016, Papishetal2015}. If the present results hold to that flow structure, then the jets can explode the star, up to explosion energies of above $10^{52} {~\\rm erg}$\n\\citep{Gilkisetal2016}.  We note that because of the stochastic nature of the angular momentum of the accreted mass in many CCSNe, in the jittering jets model the spin of the NS might be inclined\nto the momentarily angular momentum of the belt. The effect of this will have to be studied in future numerical simulations.\n\nIn both cases, of common envelope removal and CCSNe, the origin region of the jets is completely  obscured. In cases where the origin of jets is seen, such as in young stellar objects, active galactic nuclei, and some binary systems, the accretion rate is low and an accretion disk is required to be formed. We here argued that in cases where accretion rate is very high, hence the entire region is heavily obscured, even accretion belt formed by sub-Keplerian inflow can launch jets (see also \\citealt{Shiberetal2015}).\n\nWe can summarize our study by stating that the possibility for accretion belts to launch collimated outflows, or jets, opens a rich variety of processes that can account for some puzzles in astrophysics, such as the explosion of massive stars and in some cases in the removal of the common envelope.\n\nThis research was supported by the Asher Fund for Space Research at the Technion, and the E. and J.
