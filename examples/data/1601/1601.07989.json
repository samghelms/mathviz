The fundamental cavity mode is externally driven and the response is\ninvestigated in the weak nonlinear regime. We find that near the crossing\npoint, at which the resonance frequencies of the cavity mode and qubit\ncoincide, the sign of the Kerr coefficient changes, and consequently the type\nof nonlinear response changes from softening to hardening. Furthermore, the\ncavity response exhibits superharmonic resonances when the ratio between the\nqubit frequency and the cavity fundamental mode frequency is tuned close to an integer\nvalue. The nonlinear response is characterized by the method of\nintermodulation and both signal and idler gains are measured. The experimental\nresults are compared with theoretical predictions and good qualitative agreement is\nobtained. The superharmonic resonances have potential for applications in\nquantum amplification and generation of entangled states of light.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\\pacs{85.25.Cp, 03.65.Ge, 42.50.Pq}\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) \\cite{Haroche_24} is the study of the\ninteraction between photons confined in a cavity and atoms (natural or\nartificial). The interaction is commonly described by the Rabi or\nJaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians \\cite{Shore_1195}, and it has been the subject of\nnumerous theoretical and experimental investigations.

With stronger driving,\nhowever, and when the ratio $\\omega_{\\mathrm{a}}/\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is tuned\nclose to integer values larger than unity, superharmonic resonances appear in\nthe measured response.

Two persistent current flux qubits \\cite{Mooij_1036},\nconsisting of a superconducting loop interrupted by four Josephson junctions\n[see Fig. \\ref{Fig device}(c)], are inductively coupled to the CPW resonator\n[see Fig. \\ref{Fig device}(b)]. In the current experiment, however, only one\nqubit significantly affects the cavity mode response, whereas the other one is\nmade effectively decoupled by detuning its energy gap away from the mode\nfrequency. A CPW line terminated by a low inductance shunt is used to send\nmicrowave pulses for coherent qubit control [see Fig. \\ref{Fig device}(b)].\nThe device is fabricated on a high resistivity silicon substrate, in a two-step\nprocess. In the first step, the resonator and the control lines are defined\nusing optical lithography, evaporation of a $190\n\n\n\\operatorname{nm}\n\n$ thick aluminum layer and liftoff.

Both passive and active shielding methods are employed to suppress magnetic field\nnoise. While passive shielding is performed using a three-layer high\npermeability metal, an active magnetic field compensation system placed\noutside the cryostat is used to actively reduce low-frequency magnetic field\nnoise. A set of superconducting coils is used to apply DC magnetic flux. Qubit\nstate control is performed using shaped microwave pulses. Attenuators and filters\nare installed at different cooling stages along the transmission lines for\nqubit control and readout.

Similar theoretical results have been obtained in Ref. \\cite{Boissonneault_060305}, in which the unitary\ntransformation that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian of the closed system has been\napplied to the system's master equation.\n\nThe effect of the qubit on cavity response is experimentally investigated\nusing transmission measurements.

In the first step of the theoretical calculation, which\nhas generated the theoretical predictions plotted in panels b and d, fixed\npoints are found by calculating steady state solutions of the equations of\nmotion that govern the dynamics of the system (see SM section I.I). Then in the\nsecond step input-output relations are employed in order to calculate the\ncavity transmission (see SM section I.E) \\cite{Gardiner_3761}. The assumed\ndevice parameters are listed in the caption of Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA}.\n\nWhile the cavity response seen in panels a and b of Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA} is nearly linear,\nnonlinearity is observed in the results depicted in panels c and d, which are\nobtained at higher input power. The measured response exhibits hardening\n(softening) when $\\Delta_{1}<0$ ($\\Delta_{1}>0$), for the case where the qubit\nmainly occupies its ground state. The opposite behavior is obtained when the\nqubit mainly occupies the first excited state. The probability for this to happen, which depends on the ratio between thermal energy and qubit energy gap, is non-negligible in the current experiment.  The comparison between the\nexperimental results (panels a and c) and the theoretical predictions (panels b\nand d, respectively) yields an acceptable agreement.\n\nIt is well known that the flux qubit is expected to strongly affect the\nresponse of the cavity mode near the primary resonance, i.e. when the ratio\n$\\omega_{\\mathrm{a}}/\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is tuned close to unity (see the\npoints labeled by $\\pm1$ in panels c and d of Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA}).

An amplifier based on flux qubits has been recently demonstrated in Ref. \\cite{Rehak_162604}. Here we employ the\nmethod of IMD to characterize frequency mixing. In this method, two\nmonochromatic tones are combined and injected into the cavity: an intense pump\ntone at angular frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and amplitude $b_{\\mathrm{c}\n1}^{\\mathrm{in}}$, and a weaker signal tone at angular frequency\n$\\omega_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\omega_{\\mathrm{p}}+\\omega$ and amplitude $c_{\\mathrm{c}\n1}^{\\mathrm{in}}$. The cavity transmission is measured and the spectral\namplitude of the output signal tone at frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{s}}$, which\nis labeled by $c_{\\mathrm{c}2}^{\\mathrm{out}}\\left(  \\omega\\right)  $, and the\nspectral amplitude of the so-called idler tone at frequency $2\\omega\n_{\\mathrm{p}}-\\omega_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\omega_{\\mathrm{p}}-\\omega$, which is\nlabeled by $c_{\\mathrm{c}2}^{\\mathrm{out}}\\left(  -\\omega\\right)  $, are\nrecorded. The corresponding signal gain $G_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\left\\vert\nc_{\\mathrm{c}2}^{\\mathrm{out}}\\left(  \\omega\\right)  /c_{\\mathrm{c}\n1}^{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\vert ^{2}$ and idler gain $G_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\left\\vert\nc_{\\mathrm{c}2}^{\\mathrm{out}}\\left(  -\\omega\\right)  /c_{\\mathrm{c}\n1}^{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\vert ^{2}$ are determined, and the experimental\nfindings are compared with the theoretical predictions, which are based on the\nlinearized equations of motion of the system (see SM section I.L).\n\nThe results are exhibited in Fig. \\ref{Fig IMD}, in which the cavity\ntransmission $S_{21}$ (left panels) and the signal $G_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and idler\n$G_{\\mathrm{i}}$ gains (right panels) are plotted vs. pump frequency\n$f_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\omega_{\\mathrm{p}}/2\\pi$ for different values of the pump\ninput power $P_{\\mathrm{p}}$. The magnetic flux for these measurements is set\nto a value for which $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}/2\\pi=8.1\n\n\n\\operatorname{GHz}\n\n$ and $\\Delta_{1}/2\\pi=-1.5\n\n\n\\operatorname{GHz}\n\n$. Relatively good agreement between data and theory (see SM section I.L) is\nfound for the results seen in Fig. \\ref{Fig IMD}, however, the deviation\nbetween data and theory becomes larger at higher powers. Further study is\nneeded in order to identify the sources of discrepancy, and to improve the\naccuracy of the theoretical predictions accordingly.\n\nIn summary, superharmonic resonances in the device under study have been\nexperimentally observed. We theoretically show that a relatively simple CQED\nmodel of a system composed of two coupled elements, a single cavity mode\nhaving no intrinsic nonlinearity and a two-level system, can account for the\nmain experimental findings. Further study will aim at expanding the range of\nvalidity of the theoretical predictions in order to account for the\nexperimental results at higher levels of input power. Future experiments will\nexplore the possibility of exploiting nonlinearity for improving the fidelity\nof qubit readout and employ superharmonic resonances for generating highly\ncorrelated states of the microwave cavity field (e.g. the creation of\nentangled pairs of microwave photons near the \\thinspace$n=2$ superharmonic\nresonance via two-photon stimulated emission events).\n\nWe thank Feyruz Kitapli and Pol Forn-D{\\'\\i}az for useful discussions.

Note that when $\\Delta_{1}T_{2}\\gg1$ and when the qubit mainly occupies\nthe state $\\left\\vert \\pm\\right\\rangle $ the term $\\Upsilon_{\\mathrm{ba}}$\ngives rise to a shift in the mode angular frequency approximately given by\n$\\mp g_{1}^{2}/\\Delta_{1}$ and a shift in the value of the Kerr coefficient\napproximately given by $\\pm\\left(  g_{1}^{4}/\\Delta_{1}^{3}\\right)  \\left(\n4T_{1}/T_{2}\\right)  $. Similar theoretical results have been obtained in Ref. \\cite{Boissonneault_060305}, in which the unitary\ntransformation that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian of the closed system has been\napplied to the system's master equation.\n\nThe effect of the qubit on cavity response is experimentally investigated\nusing transmission measurements. The color coded plots in Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA}\nexhibit the measured (panels a and c) and calculated (panels b and d) cavity\ntransmission (in dB units) vs. $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}/2\\pi$, for the case where\nthe power injected into the cavity is $-127$ dBm (panels a and b) and $-112$\ndBm (panels c and d). In the first step of the theoretical calculation, which\nhas generated the theoretical predictions plotted in panels b and d, fixed\npoints are found by calculating steady state solutions of the equations of\nmotion that govern the dynamics of the system (see SM section I.I). Then in the\nsecond step input-output relations are employed in order to calculate the\ncavity transmission (see SM section I.E) \\cite{Gardiner_3761}. The assumed\ndevice parameters are listed in the caption of Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA}.\n\nWhile the cavity response seen in panels a and b of Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA} is nearly linear,\nnonlinearity is observed in the results depicted in panels c and d, which are\nobtained at higher input power. The measured response exhibits hardening\n(softening) when $\\Delta_{1}<0$ ($\\Delta_{1}>0$), for the case where the qubit\nmainly occupies its ground state. The opposite behavior is obtained when the\nqubit mainly occupies the first excited state. The probability for this to happen, which depends on the ratio between thermal energy and qubit energy gap, is non-negligible in the current experiment.  The comparison between the\nexperimental results (panels a and c) and the theoretical predictions (panels b\nand d, respectively) yields an acceptable agreement.\n\nIt is well known that the flux qubit is expected to strongly affect the\nresponse of the cavity mode near the primary resonance, i.e. when the ratio\n$\\omega_{\\mathrm{a}}/\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is tuned close to unity (see the\npoints labeled by $\\pm1$ in panels c and d of Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA}). With\nsufficiently large driving amplitude, however, higher order nonlinear\nprocesses may give rise to superharmonic resonances, which occur near the\npoints at which the ratio $\\omega_{\\mathrm{a}}/\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is an\ninteger larger than unity (see the points labeled by $\\pm2$, $\\pm3$ and $4$ in\npanels c and d of Fig. \\ref{Fig VNA}).
