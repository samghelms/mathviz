An appealing option to experimentally address this question is the use of single atoms as thermometers immersed in the ultracold gas, which can be understood as the most extreme case of minority species thermometry \\cite{Olf2015, McKay2010, Regal2007, Nascimbene2010, Spiegelhalder2009}.\n\tIn order to serve as a local temperature probe, the particle should, first, thermalize much faster with its local environment than the many-body system does globally.\n\tSecond, detection of the probe atoms should feature high spatial resolution.\n\tAnd third, the probe should not affect the temperature of the many-body system.\n\tThis suggests using few or even single particles having a much larger inter-species interaction, hence thermalization rate with atoms of the gas, than the intra-species interaction of the gas atoms.\n\tWe realize such a system by using single $^{133}$Cs atoms as thermometers for a cold, thermal $^{87}$Rb cloud, where the inter-species scattering length is $\\approx6.3$ times larger than the Rb-Rb intra-species scattering length \\cite{Lercher2011,vanKempen2002} and may also be tuned by employing a Feshbach resonance \\cite{Takekoshi2012}.\n\tThe determination of a single thermometer atom's temperature relies on measuring the energy distribution of an average over many identical realizations.\n\tFor Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed energies, a temperature can be assigned.\n\tWhile the energy distribution of tightly confined particles may be measured via vibrational spectroscopy \\cite{Foerster2009,Diedrich1989}, we focus on a complementary method which can be applied to weakly confined particles, where the vibrational states within the external potential are too small to be resolved.\n\tThis so-called release-recapture method detects the remaining fraction of trapped atoms after a short release from the trap for a variable period of time \\cite{Reymond2003,Mudrich2002}.\n\tThe data is compared to Monte-Carlo simulations assuming different initial temperatures to identify the simulation temperature reproducing the experimental data.\n\t\n\tExperimentally, the cold Rb cloud is prepared in a dipole trap, the single Cs atoms are transferred to the same potential and after an evolution time, a release-recapture experiment is performed, similar to our previous work \\cite{Spethmann2012}.\n\tFor various temperatures between 1 and $\\unit[5]{\\upmu K}$, we measure the thermometer atoms' spatial distribution and observe the atoms separating into two distinct fractions.\n\tThe first fraction thermalizes with the cold Rb cloud, whereas the second fraction does not and oscillates freely in the trap.\n\tHence, information about the cloud temperature is only encoded in the first, thermalized fraction.\n\tPerforming release-recapture experiments on the thermometer atoms with and without a cold cloud enables us to account for the non-thermalized fraction's influence. Consequently, we retrieve the cloud's temperature, in quantitative agreement to independent time-of-flight measurements of the cloud.\n\tWe further show the reliability of our method and its applicability to different scenarios, by performing release-recapture thermometry directly with the cloud, again in quantitative agreement to time-of-flight thermometry.\n\t\n\\section{Experimental System}\t\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\t\\includegraphics{dipole_potential_movie_drawing}\n\t\\end{center}\n\t\\caption{Schematic drawing of the involved traps and the calculated dipole potential for Cs used for the measurement discussed in section~\\ref{sec:movie}.

This high resolution imaging is restricted to a field of view of $\\unit[246]{\\upmu m}$, much smaller than the length scale at which relevant dynamics take place.\nWe therefore extend our effective field of view by shifting distant parts of the lattice into the imaging region and stitch the individual partial images.\nIf we are only interested in the number of Cs atoms, a different, faster scheme is employed:\nWithout using the optical lattice, Rb is pushed out of the dipole trap, the Cs atoms are transferred back to the MOT and their fluorescence level is used to determine the atom number \\cite{Haubrich1996,Ruschewitz1996}.\nA more detailed description of our experimental setup is given in \\cite{Hohmann2015}.\n\t\n\t\n\\section{Release-Recapture Procedure and Simulations}\nWe measure the atomic temperature with a release-recapture procedure, that is both applicable to the cold Rb cloud and single Cs atoms, but the experimental details vary.\nIn this section, we focus on the release-recapture procedure for the Cs thermometer atoms.\nFor a release-recapture measurement, the dipole trap is switched off for a short, variable release time.\nDuring the release, the spatial distribution of the atoms expands due to their thermal energy and the atoms fall freely, due to gravity.\nA short push-out pulse for Rb consisting of resonant cooler and repumper light is applied \\unit[200]{$\\upmu$s} after the release, which is advantageous for two reasons:\nFirst, the chance of collisions between Cs and already accelerated Rb atoms is minimized, since the Rb density continually decreases during release.\nSecond, the probability of light-assisted Cs loss during the pulse is minimized because even low momentum transfer can separate the two species rapidly, as there is no trapping force.\nAfter recapture, a release-time dependent fraction of atoms have enough energy to escape the trap.\nThe probability for an atom escaping the trap, however, does not only depend on its total energy but on the distribution of that energy to the atom's degrees of freedom.\nAfter a  typical waiting time of \\unit[50]{ms} for losses to occur, the recaptured atoms are transferred to the MOT, where their number is detected.\nFrom the fraction of remaining atoms as a function of release duration ('release-recapture curve'), the atoms' initial temperature can be deduced.\nAlthough there is an approximative formula \\cite{Mudrich2002} to predict the release-recapture curve for a given temperature, the approximations, e.g.~neglecting gravity, do not apply to our case.\nTherefore, we employ a classical Monte-Carlo method to simulate the atoms' dynamics from their release to the detection:\nThe atoms are modeled as point masses that do not interact with each other and are exposed to gravity and dipole trap forces.\nA 3rd order Runge-Kutta method is used to solve the equations of motion.\nRepresentative initial phase space coordinates for the thermometer atoms are obtained numerically by an iterative process:\nWe start with $1000$~atoms located at the trapping potential minimum.\nIn each iteration step, new, Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed velocities for the desired temperature are assigned to the atoms and their phase space coordinates are evolved for a time, short compared to the trap oscillation period.\nThe assignment of new velocities in each step effectively models a contact to a thermal bath, compensating the transition of thermal to potential energy as the position distribution expands to its equilibrium size during the time evolution.\nThe process is repeated until the position distribution has converged. The final sample of trapped thermal atoms represents the statistical velocity and position distributions.\nThis sample's phase-space coordinates are time-evolved to the end of the waiting time for each release time. Subsequently, the atoms remaining in the trapping region are counted, yielding a prediction for a release-recapture curve for the given temperature.\nThe simulation relies on precise knowledge of the trap geometry and its time dependence.\nTherefore, the trap geometry is determined with the help of Rb trap frequency measurements. Furthermore, absorption pictures of the Rb cloud are taken to determine where the two dipole trap beams intersect with respect to the horizontal beam's focus position.\nAlso, the time-dependence of the beam powers are recorded for each release-time, such that delays and ramp-response functions are included in the simulation.\n\n\n\\section{Single Atom Dynamics and Position-resolved Thermalization Dynamics}\n\\label{sec:movie}\nSince we are interested in the temperature of individual Cs thermometer atoms thermalized with the Rb gas, it is important to precisely know the time dependent spatial distribution of thermometer atoms in the trap.\nThis allows identifying, for example, the onset of thermalization when the atoms find first contact with the cloud after extinguishing the MOT.\nMore importantly, it allows determining the time of maximum separation between the thermalized and the non-thermalized fractions of Cs atoms.\nFirst, we record the Cs dynamics without Rb by extinguishing the MOT and switching on the lattice potential after a variable evolution time.\nThe dynamics in Fig. \\ref{fig:movie} show quasi-harmonic center-of-mass oscillations, while the dispersion of the position distribution originates from the atoms' thermal energy and the anharmonicity of the trap.\nWe fit the data with a classical Monte-Carlo simulation and find good agreement for a Cs temperature of \\unit[1.9]{$\\upmu$K}, consistent with \\cite{Salomon1990} for our MOT parameters.\nThus, the Cs atoms occupy a non-thermal state in a $\\Delta E_\\mathrm{kin}=\\unit[1.9]{\\upmu K} \\times k_\\textrm{B}$ wide energy band of axial vibration states at the potential energy of their initial position $E_\\mathrm{pot}=\\unit[16]{\\upmu K} \\times k_\\textrm{B}$.\nIn this simulation, the Cs atoms initially have Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed velocities and are normally distributed around $z=\\unit[0.133]{mm}$ with standard deviations of $\\sigma_r = \\unit[7.6]{\\upmu m}$ in radial direction and $\\sigma_z = \\nicefrac{\\sigma_r}{2}$ in the observed, axial direction.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\t\\includegraphics{movie}\n\t\\end{center}\n\t\\caption{Dynamics of single Cs atoms in the crossed dipole trap.
