Modern photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithms use galaxy magnitudes, or colors, that are obtained through multi-band imaging to produce a probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy in the map.  We used simulated data to study the effect of using different photo-z estimators to assign galaxies to redshift bins in order to compare their effects on angular clustering and galaxy bias measurements.  We found that if we use the entire PDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are less biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins.  When the redshift bin widths are  $\\Delta z=0.1$, the use of the entire PDF reduces the typical measurement bias from $5\\%$, when using single point estimates, to $3\\%$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\ngalaxy clustering; angular correlations; photometric redshift surveys\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:introduction}\nThe analysis of the three-dimensional distribution of galaxies has become one\nof the major probes used to understand the history of the Universe and the growth of\nmatter perturbations. Spectroscopic surveys such as WiggleZ\\footnote{http://wigglez.swin.edu.au/site/} \\cite{wigglezover},\nBOSS\\footnote{https://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php} \\cite{bossover} and VVDS\\footnote{http://cesam.oamp.fr/vvdsproject/vvds.html} \\cite{vvds} \nhave obtained precise maps of this distribution and many studies have increased our\nknowledge about the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of\nstructures. However, targeting galaxies and obtaining spectra is a slow and costly process; therefore, past and current spectroscopic surveys \nhave been limited to relatively low redshift and a reduced number of galaxies with respect to photometric surveys.\n\nMulti-band imaging of wide areas of the sky is complementary to spectroscopic surveys.\nThese photometric surveys, such as the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey \n(CFHTLS)\\footnote{http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Science/CFHTLS/},  \nDark Energy Survey (DES\\footnote{http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/}, \\pcite{desover}) and the Large \nSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST\\footnote{http://www.lsst.org/lsst/}, \\pcite{lsstcol}), enable lower accuracy redshift estimation \nfrom the colours of millions of galaxies without being affected by spectroscopic selection effects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotometric redshifts (photo-z) are estimated by using multi-band photometry as inputs to one or more different techniques that\nmap galaxy photometric properties into a redshift. These techniques can broadly be classified into two categories; the first is known as template-based\nmethods \\cite{BPZ,lephare}, in which a set of calibrated galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is fit to the photometric data to find the one that best represents the observed fluxes.\nThe second category use a spectroscopic training set and machine learning \nalgorithms, such as artificial neural networks \\cite{collister04}, boosted decision trees \\cite{gerdes10}, or prediction trees and random forests \\cite{tpz}, to generate a photo-$z$ PDF estimate.\n\nProbability density functions of various astronomical measurements have been used in cosmological analyses, \nfor example, luminosity functions \\cite{sheth07}, weak lensing \\cite{mandelbaum2008}, cluster identification \n\\cite{vanbreukelen09}, and the real-space clustering of quasars \\cite{myers09}. \nHowever, a systematic analysis of the use of photometric redshift PDFs in galaxy clustering has not been \nperformed, mostly due to the lack of reliable PDF estimation and its computational cost.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this work, we study how the angular clustering of galaxies depends on the chosen photo-$z$ estimate and on the photo-$z$ bin width,\nby using realistic simulations to compare clustering measurements based on photometric and spectroscopic redshifts. \nWe also show how to include the full probability density when \nestimating the angular correlation functions, and we study the impact of using \ndifferent photo-z PDF statistics (e.g., mean, mode, and median) on estimating the galaxy bias. \nIn Section \\ref{sec:methodology} we describe the methodology followed in the paper. We describe the angular clustering \nresults and the fitting to galaxy bias in Section \\ref{sec:results}, and we discuss these results in Section \\ref{sec:discussion}. \nFinally, we summarize the main conclusions in Section \\ref{sec:conclusion}.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\\label{sec:methodology}\n\nThe standard approach to analyse galaxy clustering in photometric surveys begins with subdividing the \ncatalogue into sub-samples selected by 'top-hat' photo-z redshift bins. \nThe photo-z value used to determine if  a galaxy is in one or another bin is usually a point estimate of the photo-z PDF.\nIn this paper, we quantify how angular clustering analyses are affected by the \nchoice of the specific photometric redshift estimator, including one that uses the full PDF information instead of \nphoto-z point estimates. We address this by\nmeasuring the clustering of a subsample of the DES-BCC Aardvark simulation mock galaxy \ncatalogue \\cite{busha2013}. We compared the clustering measurements given by different\nphoto-z estimators and when considering different redshift bin widths. As a specific test,\nwe quantify these differences by fitting theoretical galaxy correlation functions\nin order to estimate the linear galaxy bias, \\cite{kaiser84}, as a metric to evaluate which photo-z\nestimator is more reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Data}\nThe mock galaxy catalogue considered here is the Aardvark v1.0 catalogue from the Blind \nCosmology Challenge (BCC) simulations, developed for the DES.  \nThe catalogue is created from three $\\Lambda$CDM N-body dark \nmatter simulations, with sizes of $1050$ Mpc/h, $2600$ Mpc/h, $4000$ Mpc/h and \n$1400^3$, $2048^3$ and $2048^3$ particles, respectively. They were created using Gadget-2 \\cite{gadget} and \ninitial conditions given by CAMB \\cite{cambt} and 2LPT \\cite{2lpt}. The algorithm that populates the dark matter \nhalos with galaxies, ADDGALS \\cite{busha2013}, follows a prescription based on \nSubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM) techniques, \\cite{conroy2006,busha2013,reddick2013}. \nThe final catalogue is complete \ndown to $r<25$ and covers $1/4$ of the sky. Galaxy properties such as colour or luminosity are \nassigned by matching a spectroscopic training sample from the SDSS DR6 value added \ncatalogue \\cite{blanton05} at low redshift. This training is extrapolated to higher redshift \nmatching the colour distribution to SDSS DR8 \\cite{sdssdr8} and DEEP2 \\cite{deep2} photometric data. Then,\nthe output catalogue includes DES colors and errors for each galaxy of the catalogue. \nThese catalogues have been compared with real data by the DES collaboration \n\\cite{chang2015,leistedt2015}.\n\n\nThe full BCC-Aardvark-v1.0c catalogue covers $10,313$ square degrees to the full DES depth, \nand includes a total of $1.36 \\times 10^{9}$ galaxies. The simulated catalogue is stored in files \naccording to {\\tt Healpix} \\footnote{http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/} \\cite{healpix} pixels of $n_{side}=8$. \nWe chose a contiguous area of the simulation by using $24$ pixels, \nwhich corresponds to an area of about $1,200$ square degrees on the sphere in order to \nhave a significant sampling of small scales.\n For our study, we have selected the galaxy sample according to a magnitude \nlimited cut of $g<24$. This cut corresponds to a selection in the g-band of signal-to-noise greater than 20 \nin the simulation, which incorporates the DES observed photometric error. \nThe total number of galaxies in the catalogue after applying the \nmagnitude cut is around 30 million galaxies. \n\n\\subsection{Photometric redshift code}\nWe have used the publicly available code TPZ\\footnote{http://lcdm.astro.illinois.edu/code/mlz.html} \n\\cite{tpz} to estimate the galaxy \nredshift probability distributions. TPZ is a parallel code that estimates photo-$z$ PDFs using \nprediction trees and random forests. A prediction tree is constructed by splitting \nthe data in recursive branches until a convergence criterion is reached. In order to \nconstruct more robust PDFs, the code uses the random forest technique in which $N_T$ \nbootstrap samples of the training set are created and prediction trees are generated for the \n$N_T$ samples. In order to include the measurement errors, e.g., magnitude errors, $N_R$ \ntraining samples are created by perturbing the training set according to the errors of the \nmeasurement variables. Finally, the PDF of each galaxy in the sample is created by \ncombining the prediction trees. TPZ was one of the algorithms used in the \nDES Science Verification Data \\cite{sanchez14}, and produced one of the best performances for that  dataset. \n\nWe have considered $10^5$ galaxies as a training set, up to the full depth and a cut \nin the magnitude errors avoiding extremely large values in order to use all the available \nmagnitude-redshift information from the simulation; and we, therefore, use less than $1\\%$ \nof the available data for this purpose. The training set galaxies were confined to a region of $54$ square degrees. \nThe test data used for the main analysis of this paper was directly selected from the simulation with no cuts on magnitude errors. \nThe effect of the redshift selection of galaxies for the training set \nin the results is shown in section \\ref{sec:trainsel}. \n\nAs defined in \\pcite{tpz}, the concentration of individual galaxy \nPDFs, $p(z)$, is output by TPZ as a PDF concentration parameter called zConf. \nThis parameter is defined as the integrated probability between $z_{phz}\\pm\\sigma_{TPZ}(1+z_{phz})$, where $z_{phz}$ is the photometric redshift, \nand it measures the narrowness of the PDF. In this case, we \nselected $\\sigma_{TPZ}=0.075$, which is similar to the $1-\\sigma$ confidence interval of the PDFs. We can select different quality cuts by using this parameter, which is \nrelated to the BPZ ODDS parameter \\cite{BPZ}. \n\n\n\n\nTPZ is a particular method of the MLZ framework. MLZ is code that computes photometric \nredshift PDFs using machine learning techniques. It \nincorporates a Bayesian combination of techniques that estimate photometric redshift PDFs, including both \ntemplate based methods and unsupervised machine learning algorithms \\cite{bayesian}, and \nalso enables an efficient storage of the PDFs by using a sparse representation basis \\cite{sparse}.  \nFor simplicity, we only used TPZ for the photometric redshifts in this paper, which is justified by the excellent results produced by \nTPZ on the DES Science Verification Data \\cite{sanchez14}, and by the fact that we want to study the impact of using \nphoto-$z$ PDFs in clustering as produced by a single technique (to simplify the resulting analysis). TPZ has been used, together with other codes listed in \\pcite{sanchez14}, in \nseveral DES Science Verification Data studies \\cite{bonnet15,crocce15,giannantonio15,des15}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Survey configuration: Photo-z binning}\nGalaxy clustering analyses in photometric surveys are usually done by measuring angular correlations of \ngalaxy samples selected in different redshift bins. We divide the full redshift range, which in this paper we restrict to the range $0.2<z<1.4$, into \n$N_z$ redshift bins of width $\\Delta z$ in order to reduce the extent of the projection of radial information for \n2D clustering analysis. As shown in \\pcite{Asorey2012} and \\pcite{eriksen15}, the optimal photometric redshift bins \nare given by shells of about twice the size of the photometric redshift standard deviation. In this paper, we consider different configurations: $\\Delta z=\\{0.1,0.15,0.2,0.3\\}$ in order to study the evolution of photometric clustering \nwith bin width. The true redshift distribution of galaxies, $n(z)$, is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:fig2}, together with the redshift distribution \nobtained by stacking TPZ PDFs. We also show (red) the $n(z)$ of the spectroscopic training set.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.43\\textwidth]{Fig1.pdf}\n\\caption{In blue, the galaxy redshift distribution for 31 million galaxies with $g<24$ in the BCC Aadvark 1.0 catalogue\n in the selected region of $1,200$ square degrees used for our analysis.

However, this previous work only considered unweighted pair counts in any given bin, i.e., weights of $f_z=1$. In Figure \\ref{fig:fig4}, we extend this previous result to compare the results for both pair count and pixel-based methods when considering galaxy \nweights in the redshift bin $1.0<z<1.2$ and a threshold $p_{threshold}=0.1$. As shown in this figure, over the angular range $0.1<\\theta<1.0$, we find a good agreement. The number of jackknife regions is \ndifferent in the two cases, however, being $N_{JK}=32$ for the point-to-point case and $N_{JK}=384$ when considering the pixel-based estimator. We opted to use the computationally simpler pixel-based estimator in the rest of the paper.\n\n\\subsection{Clustering amplitude}\\label{sec:res2}\nWe now focus our analysis on the relative amplitude between the angular clustering signal using different photo-z selection criteria and the \ntrue redshift clustering. This allows us to directly study how the different statistical representations of photometric redshift change the measurement signal.\n\n\nIn the analysis, we divide the redshift range $0.2<z<1.4$ into different numbers of bins in order to consider different bin configurations. As a result, a comparison between individual redshift bins for different bin configurations may consider different redshift regions for different configuration. For this reason, we present clustering results for bins with different widths in symmetrical manner about a given central redshift. As discussed previously, we restrict our analysis to four different bin widths. In Figure \\ref{fig:fig5}, we present the ratios of the photometric redshift clustering with respect to the true redshift clustering, for different statistical estimators and a redshift bin centered at $z=1$.\n\nIn the left panels, we show the results for a broad bin of $\\Delta z=0.3$ in the redshift range $0.85<z<1.15$. As expected, for all algorithms, the amplitude of the clustering of the photometric sample is smaller than when using the true redshifts, since the errors on a photometric redshift estimate will suppress this inherent clustering.  Notice that the clustering measurements when using the mode, $\\hat{z}$, and mean, $\\bar{z}$,\n are similar. \nAny small differences are due to the fact that each selection produces a different $n(z)$ when individual PDFs are not symmetric, like the one shown in Figure \\ref{fig:fig1}.  \n\nIn the bottom panels we show the clustering ratios with respect to the true clustering when using PDF weights with different probability thresholds. To aid in the comparison, we also present the ratio for $\\hat{z}$ with the red dashed line. This allows us to both clean our sample, as if using a quality cut, and sample  \nmore narrow redshift bins. The thresholds considered are $p_{threshold}={0.0,0.1}$.  The signal depends on the cut on the selection of \nweighted galaxies. The stronger the cut, the cleaner the sample and the clustering amplitude increases, as well as the intrinsic $n(z)$. But this may also bias our results as we may be changing the average galaxy types in the sample, as discussed in \\pcite{marti14}. Here we considered a low threshold that is non-negligible to compare with the full PDF case.\n\nWe consider narrower bin configurations in order to test what happens as we approach the intrinsic photo-z dispersion error, summarized in Figure \\ref{fig:fig3}. \nWe see in the case when $\\Delta z=0.2$ that the amplitude of the photometric samples clustering decreases with respect to the  \ntrue redshift clustering. The angular clustering signal is proportional to $n(z)^2$, as explained by Equation (\\ref{eq:wtheta}), which in the top hat case means that it is inversely proportional to $(\\Delta z)^2$. Photometric samples distribution in true redshift are broader than the top hat bin and therefore, the signal amplitude is smaller. The bin considered in this case for \ngalaxy selection is  $0.9<z<1.1$. We see that the differences between the mode and the mean are bigger than in the previous case with $\\Delta z = 0.3$. This may be a result of the fact that when we consider bins much bigger than the intrinsic separations, the differences between photo-z single statistic estimators are smaller.\nAs we extend the comparison to smaller widths, $\\Delta z=0.15$ ($0.925<z<1.075$), the ratio between the angular clustering signal for the photometric samples and the sample with true redshift becomes smaller. This is in agreement with the trend we saw before,  as $w(\\theta)\\propto (1/\\Delta z)^2$ for true redshift clustering, while the photo-z dispersion keeps the corresponding signal diluted in the radial direction.\n\n\nThe case with $\\Delta z=0.1$ ($0.95<z<1.05$) shows the same trend than the previous cases with bigger bin widths. The ratio of the photometric redshift signals to the true redshift signal continues to decrease. The results with mean and mode estimators tend to converge as the bin width approaches the photo-z dispersion error. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.45\\textwidth]{Fig7.pdf}\n\\caption{The evolution of the clustering amplitude at $\\theta=0.1$ for a redshift bin centered at $z=0.5$ with a given bin width, $\\Delta z$.

The angular range considered was set to cover the co-moving coordinates range $10 h^{-1}Mpc<r<60 h^{-1}Mpc$, which corresponds to different angular ranges in each redshift bin. The minimum scale was selected by testing at which scale the linear growth model for the spatial correlation departs from a non-linear model. Notice that this is a conservative cut when compared with the cuts used in \\cite{crocce15}. This corresponds to $\\theta_{min}=0.8$ degrees at the lowest redshift and $\\theta_{min}=0.19$ degrees at highest redshift bin. \n\nThe comparison between the different photo-z selection methods is done by comparing each galaxy bias measurement with the true result, which is determined by using the true redshift distribution of the selected galaxies in order to do a fair comparison.  First, we show in Figure \\ref{fig:fig9} the galaxy bias measurement made by using different photometric redshift statistics and the bias measurement done by selecting galaxies according to the spectroscopic redshift. Notice that the spectroscopic sample in each bin is different than the photometric samples considered, but since this is accounted for in the bias measurement, we can study how the photo-z statistic measurements compare with the spectroscopic one. \n\nIn panel {\\it a} of  Figure \\ref{fig:fig9}, we show the evolution of galaxy bias for the broad $\\Delta z=0.3$ bin configuration. We only show results for the true redshift, $z_s$, the mode redshift, $\\hat{z}$, the mean redshift, $\\bar{z}$, and the PDF weighted samples for clarity. We do not show here the results when applying photometric redshift quality cuts. The measurements are similar and the slightly different values for the different estimators are within the statistical error bars. This is reasonable as we are considering a broad redshift bins in this panel, and the differences between different photometric samples redshift distributions are thus small. \n\nThe same trend is observed when considering $N_z=6$ redshift bins, as shown in panel {\\it b} on Figure \\ref{fig:fig9}. This case corresponds to bins with $\\Delta z = 0.2$ width, which is larger than twice the photo-z dispersion, and, therefore, photometric redshift effects are still not the biggest issue. The evolution of linear galaxy bias with redshift resembles  the plot shown in Figure 17 of \\pcite{crocce15} for a MICECATv2.0 \\cite{carretero15} sample, as the ratio $b_g(z=1.1)/b_g(z=0.3)$ is similar for both simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe show in the lower left plot in Figure \\ref{fig:fig9} the measurement of the bias for the different redshift estimators when considering $N_z=8$ redshift bins. In this case, we begin to observe bigger differences between the \ncase when using photometric redshifts and the case when the bias was obtained by using spectroscopic redshifts, especially when compared to the previous cases that used larger bin widths. \n\nFinally, we show in the bottom right panel of Figure \\ref{fig:fig9} the bias evolution when using $12$ bins of width $\\Delta z=0.1$. The differences between the photo-z galaxy bias results and the spectroscopic bias measurement are larger than for the previous cases with broader bin configurations. The closest result to the spectroscopic results value of the bias is obtained when using the full PDF information $(p_{threshold}=0$), especially at intermediate redshifts.\n\nWe show in Figure \\ref{fig:fig10} the measurement bias between the method that uses PDF stacking to estimate $n(z)$ and the true value, given by the $n(z)$ measured directly from the true redshifts from the simulation of the photometric sample. We show in the top left panel the relative differences when considering $\\Delta z=0.3$ for the three methods, finding small deviations with respect to the true results with minor differences between the different selection techniques. These observed differences exist because \nthe PDF stacking technique is not perfectly reconstructing the true $n(z)$ of the population sample in the tomographic bins. In this case, the differences are small because the bin width is broad and photo-z systematics in the $n(z)$ are smaller.  \n\nWhen we decrease the bin width to $\\Delta z = 0.2$, the differences grow, as shown in the top right panel of Figure \\ref{fig:fig10}. The three methods are still producing similar results, and, because the bins are still too broad, the relative bias is zero, within the error bars. When the configuration changes to bins with widths $\\Delta z=0.15$, differences start to become more apparent and the PDF weighting method begins to differ from the single point estimate estimators. For the narrowest bin width configuration considered, $\\Delta z = 0.1$, the differences at intermediate redshifts are larger than $5\\%$ for single point estimators, whereas for PDF weighted galaxy samples, these differences are around $3\\%$. We include a table in Appendix \\ref{sec:ap2} that presents all galaxy bias measurements and the relative differences with the true results. \n\nIn order to summarize and quantify these results, we show in Figure \\ref{fig:fig13} the mean value of the mean absolute deviation between each selection method and the true result for each bin width.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.48\\textwidth]{Fig10.pdf}\n\\caption{Evolution with redshift bin width of the percentage deviation of the mean of the absolute difference with the true redshift result for the different photometric redshift statistics. We artificially shift the x-axis values in order to more clearly show the results from the different measures. Notice the accumulated measurement bias when using \nphoto-z redshifts, which is smaller when using PDF weights in the clustering measurements, especially for the narrower bin configurations.}\n\\label{fig:fig13}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nWe found that for the largest bin widths, the differences are around $1\\%$ and are similar for the three photo-z selection statistics: mean, mode, and pdf weighting. However, for the narrower bins, the deviation when we consider summary statistics is around $5\\%$, while it is $3\\%$ when using the photo-z PDF galaxy weighting method.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Reducing the redshift bin catalogue size}\nUsing full PDF information in galaxy clustering produces less biased measurements than point estimate photo-z methods, but it also increases the size of each redshift bin galaxy sample. We also studied how a Monte Carlo sampling of the PDF, in order to define a point estimate that encloses more of the PDF than the mean or the mode, or applying a threshold cut based on the amount of PDF in each bin compares to the full PDF inclusion method.\n\n\\subsubsection{Monte Carlo sampling redshift}\nWe extended the previous analysis to include a Monte Carlo sampling redshift, $z_{MC}$, which assigns a redshift value based on the cumulative distribution function for each galaxy. We make our previous galaxy bias measurement in the different redshift bins according to $z_{MC}$. In Figure \\ref{fig:fig11b} we show the best fit galaxy bias for galaxies selected according to  $z_{MC}$ in $N_z=8$ redshift bins of $\\Delta z = 0.15$.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.48\\textwidth]{Fig11.pdf}\n\\caption{\\emph{Bias evolution in Monte Carlo sampling redshift shells of width $\\Delta z = 0.15$:}  Bias measurement in $8$ redshift bins defined by the Monte Carlo sampling redshifts (orange). We consider the cases with $n(z)$ estimated by using PDF stacking and the true $n(z)$. We also compare the galaxy bias fitting with the PDF weights results from figure \\ref{fig:fig9} (green). The standard performance of Monte Carlo redshifts is similar to the results given by PDF weights.}\n\\label{fig:fig11b}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nWe observe that in this case the results are similar to the results given by PDF weights (for example, the results from panel c of Figure \\ref{fig:fig9}), both when using PDF sampling or the true redshift distributions. This is expected, as we are using the probabilistic information to determine the Monte Carlo sampling redshifts. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Quality cuts}\nThe effect of sparse PDFs with multiple peaks can introduce significant noise into our PDF weighting scheme. \nAlthough it is not the main interest of this paper, we considered a case in which we applied a threshold cut $f_z>(p_{threshold}=0.1)$ in \norder to select galaxies in the different bins. The effect is a combination of a quality cut and a cut on galaxies that are not in the bin but \nwhose tails are inside the bin, which produces bigger catalogues in each tomographic bin. In Figure \\ref{fig:figqual}, we present a comparison between a photo-z sample selected \naccording to full photo-z PDFs for \na configuration with bin width $\\Delta z=0.15$ and a a sample selected by applying a threshold to the photo-z PDF weights of $f_z>0.1$.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.48\\textwidth]{Fig12.pdf}\n\\caption{\\emph{PDF threshold cuts:} A comparison between the effect of applying a threshold cut on the selection process with photo-z PDF weights for \nthe configuration in a redshift bin width of $\\Delta z=0.15$. Both samples produce similar galaxy bias measurements.}\n\\label{fig:figqual}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nWe found that the results are similar, supporting the idea of applying threshold cuts to reduce the size of the galaxy \ndensity in each pixel in the map, although cuts to a sample have to be applied carefully in order to \navoid introducing selection biases to the sample, see, e.g., \\pcite{marti14}. We observe this effect in Figure \\ref{fig:figqual}, as the true results for both samples are not exactly equivalent. A detailed study of using quality cuts from PDF information is outside the scope of this paper. \n\n\\subsection{Systematics}\n\\subsubsection{Training set sample variance}\n\\label{sec:trainsel}\nSince we use one galaxy sample from one particular pixel of the simulation for our photo-z training set, we wanted to demonstrate \nthat the choice of this one pixel did not bias our results. As a result, we compared the spectroscopic $n(z)$ \nfor the galaxies in our training sample with the mean spectroscopic $n(z)$ from ten randomly selected \ngalaxy samples from the entire area, to demonstrate that our results were not dependent on the choice of a particular pixel. We are not, in this paper, \nexploring the more traditional concept of photometric redshift 'sample variance' as discussed, for example, in \\pcite{cunha12}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.48\\textwidth]{Fig13.pdf}\n\\caption{\\emph{Training set sample variance:} Relative differences between the amplitude of the theoretical dark matter angular correlations when using the spectroscopic $n(z)$ of the training set and the mean $n(z)$ of ten samples with the same number of spectroscopic objects as the training set but distributed across the catalogue area. We considered both the full redshift range $0<z<2$ (black) and a redshift bin $0.3<z<0.5$ (red). We find a relative bias in the angular range $0.1<\\theta<1$ smaller than $2\\%$, which propagates to an error smaller than $1\\%$ on the galaxy bias, which is lower than the observed galaxy bias described in this paper.} \n\\label{fig:fig15}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\nWe show in Figure {\\ref{fig:fig15}} the relative difference between theoretical angular correlations, computed by using Equation (\\ref{eq:wtheta}), when we used the training set $n(z)$ (red line in Figure \\ref{fig:fig2}) and the mean $n(z)$ of ten different random samples extracted from the catalogue with the same number of galaxies as the training set, which is similar to the blue solid line in Figure \\ref{fig:fig2}.  We found relative differences smaller than $2\\%$ over the redshift range for all angles, $0.1<\\theta<1$. This implies a relative difference smaller than $1\\%$ for the galaxy bias, which is lower than the differences observed for our different photo-z statistics. \n\n\\subsubsection{True redshift distribution reconstruction}\nAs observed in section \\ref{sec:res3}, the main difference between the photometric redshift and the true redshift galaxy bias measurement is a result of the failure to recover the true redshift distribution, $n(z)$. As an example, in Figure \\ref{fig:fignzrecgauss}, we show the difference between the true redshift distribution (blue line) and the PDF stacking PDF (green dashed line) for  galaxies selected with mean redshift within $0.65<z<0.8$.  \n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.48\\textwidth]{Fig14.pdf}\n\\caption{\\emph{Redshift distribution reconstruction:} A comparison between the PDF stacking $n(z)$ (dashed green) and the true redshift distribution (blue) obtained by selecting galaxies with mean photometric redshift in the redshift bin $0.65<z<0.8$.

We see that  the difference between the measured $n(z)$ is within the accuracy of the photo-z catalogue, shown in Figure \\ref{fig:fig3}. \nWe explore this result in more detail in Appendix \\ref{sec:ap3}, where we look at the differences between the $n(z)$ obtained from stacking the photo-z PDF of galaxies selected in redshift shells according to their mean redshift and the true distribution of the same sample when using both different bin configurations and different redshift ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:discussion}\nIn this paper, we have studied how the angular galaxy clustering obtained from photometric populations depends on the different statistical estimators used \nto assign galaxies to specific redshift bins. The primary estimators that we have considered are the mean and the mode of a galaxy's photo-$z$ PDF. \nWe found differences between the different estimators, in part, since they produce different galaxy samples in each top hat photometric redshift bin. As a result, the clustering signal is different when using either the mean or the mode.\n\nWe also included the full PDF information in our clustering analysis by weighting each galaxy according to the \nintegrated probability that the galaxy actually resided within each redshift bin. This clustering signal is smaller than the clustering signal from single point estimates samples. If we apply a threshold cut of $p_{threshold}=0.1$, the clustering amplitude increases. This is explained by the fact that when we consider a larger threshold the corresponding $n(z)$ is narrower than when considering all galaxies with non-negligible weights in a redshift bin. However, we also may be sampling different type of galaxies, since we are only selecting galaxies with higher probability to lie within the bin. \n\nWe extended the comparison between the different photometric redshift statistical representations to a cosmological parameter estimation analysis by measuring the linear galaxy bias in different redshift bins. We find that, in general, the photo-z estimators produce similar results, especially when considering broad bins. We find that there is a relative bias with respect to the true galaxy bias results, since the PDF stacking redshift distributions in each bin differ from the true redshift distributions. For narrow bins, the selection method given by PDF weights produces less biased differences with respect to the true results. The mean deviation for a bin configuration with width $\\Delta z=0.1$ is $3\\%$ when using PDF weights, while it is $5\\%$ when using summary or single point estimate statistics. Thus, the use of photo-z PDF weights to select galaxies in tomographic redshift bins in order to measure the galaxy clustering in a photometric survey produces more robust results than using single point estimates.   \nWe can use the methodology presented  in this paper to calibrate the effect of assigning galaxies to photo-z bins to ensure that the \nmodel parameters from simulations mimic the real data catalogues. This also applies to other photo-z methods that estimate PDFs  \\cite{sanchez14,bonnet15,leistedt2015} as they will have similar behaviours\n\nCreating maps with PDF weights involves much larger data sets than catalogues of galaxies selected \nonly by redshift. One way to reduce the amount of data is to apply a cautious PDF quality cut by using a threshold when considering PDF weights. We found similar results \nto the full PDF results, although any cut on a sample has to be carefully tested.\nAnother way to reduce the size of the catalogues, while still retaining a certain level of the PDF information, is by using Monte Carlo Sampling point estimates. \nWe found that Monte Carlo Sampling estimators produce similar results to our PDF weight results.\n\nThe effect of choosing different photometric redshift training samples from the simulation on the calculation of the galaxy bias measurement is smaller than $1\\%$, which is lower than the effects due to the different photo-z statistics used in this paper. Likewise, the differences between  stacking photo-z PDFs to compute the redshift distribution and the true redshift distribution are also within the photo-z errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\\label{sec:conclusion}\nWith photometric surveys, we can accumulate much larger galaxy samples in less time than with spectroscopic surveys. However, the lack of true redshifts restricts the quality of any \nradial information on such a survey, as photometric redshift are produced from multi-band imaging.  \n\nTherefore, we need to set a statistical definition of a photometric redshift in order to identify which tomographic redshift bin contains a given galaxy. The search for an optimal definition \nis the main goal of this paper. The core analysis of this paper consisted of defining a new photo-z selection method that includes the full photo-z PDF information by weighting each galaxy in the redshift bin with the probability that the galaxy lies in that bin, and to compare this result with methods based on  single statistical estimates such as the mean or the mode of the photo-z PDF.\n\nWe found, using mock galaxy catalogues and a machine learning photo-z code, that if we use single point statistics, like the mode or the mean, there is an offset on the galaxy bias measurements. These bias measurements are obtained either by measuring photometric redshift distributions by stacking the individual photo-z PDFs or from the true redshift distribution of the same galaxies. This shift must be taken into account when considering similar large scale structure analyses that leverage galaxies drawn from photometric surveys. This corrective effect can be estimated by applying a similar method to measure the offset in the determination of the cosmological measurement of interest by using simulations in similar conditions to the expected photometric data. In our case, we used the galaxy bias as the metric to test different photo-z statistics, and we found that, for single point statistics, the cumulative deviation is a $5\\%$ for a bin configuration with width $\\Delta z= 0.1$.\n\nOur results are closer to the ground truth if we weight the contribution of each galaxy to a photo-z bin according to the amount of their photo-z PDF in each redshift bin. This approach, on the other hand, produces a difference of $3\\%$ in the $\\Delta z=0.1$. Therefore, and especially for narrow photometric top hat bins, PDF weighting is more optimal than simply using summary statistic photometric redshifts.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nJA and JJT acknowledge support from U.S. Department of Energy Grant No, DE-SC0009932.

We observe that the simple error estimate is close to \nthe unbiased estimate ($\\mu=0$, $\\sigma_G=1$). We can also consider the mode redshift, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:figap2}, where we see that \nthe distribution of the modes tends to be more concentrated than the distribution of the means.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.48\\textwidth]{Fig_ap_2.pdf}\n\\caption{\\emph{Photometric standardized error for the mode}:  The photometric standardized error computed from the mode of \neach individual galaxy's photo-z PDF compared to the best fit Gaussian. As modes are defined by the peak of each PDF, the distribution tends \nto be more concentrated than the distribution of mean PDF values.} \n\\label{fig:figap2}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe also tested how photometric redshifts are distributed according to the confidence intervals \nby estimating the number of galaxies with photometric redshifts inside $1-\\sigma$ and $2-\\sigma$ levels, which is shown in Table \\ref{table:tableap1}.\n\\begin{table}\n{\\center\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n &$1-\\sigma$ & $2-\\sigma$ \\\\ \n\\hline\n$\\bar{z}$&$70\\%$&$93\\%$  \\\\\n\\hline  \n$\\hat{z}$&$69\\%$&$90\\%$  \\\\\n\\hline  \n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Proportion of photometric redshifts inside $1-\\sigma$ and $2-\\sigma$ level confidence intervals for the mean, $\\bar{z}$ and the mode, $\\hat{z}$, photometric \nredshifts.

In each case, we stack the galaxy photo-x PDFs to compute the redshift distribution. We also present the goodness of fit for each fit and the relative difference with the appropriate true measurement.\n\\begin{table*}\n{\\center\n\\resizebox{\\textwidth}{!}{\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\n\\cline{2-10}\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{}&\\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{$\\bar{z}$}

However, this previous work only considered unweighted pair counts in any given bin, i.e., weights of $f_z=1$. In Figure \\ref{fig:fig4}, we extend this previous result to compare the results for both pair count and pixel-based methods when considering galaxy \nweights in the redshift bin $1.0<z<1.2$ and a threshold $p_{threshold}=0.1$. As shown in this figure, over the angular range $0.1<\\theta<1.0$, we find a good agreement. The number of jackknife regions is \ndifferent in the two cases, however, being $N_{JK}=32$ for the point-to-point case and $N_{JK}=384$ when considering the pixel-based estimator. We opted to use the computationally simpler pixel-based estimator in the rest of the paper.\n\n\\subsection{Clustering amplitude}\\label{sec:res2}\nWe now focus our analysis on the relative amplitude between the angular clustering signal using different photo-z selection criteria and the \ntrue redshift clustering. This allows us to directly study how the different statistical representations of photometric redshift change the measurement signal.\n\n\nIn the analysis, we divide the redshift range $0.2<z<1.4$ into different numbers of bins in order to consider different bin configurations. As a result, a comparison between individual redshift bins for different bin configurations may consider different redshift regions for different configuration. For this reason, we present clustering results for bins with different widths in symmetrical manner about a given central redshift. As discussed previously, we restrict our analysis to four different bin widths. In Figure \\ref{fig:fig5}, we present the ratios of the photometric redshift clustering with respect to the true redshift clustering, for different statistical estimators and a redshift bin centered at $z=1$.\n\nIn the left panels, we show the results for a broad bin of $\\Delta z=0.3$ in the redshift range $0.85<z<1.15$. As expected, for all algorithms, the amplitude of the clustering of the photometric sample is smaller than when using the true redshifts, since the errors on a photometric redshift estimate will suppress this inherent clustering.  Notice that the clustering measurements when using the mode, $\\hat{z}$, and mean, $\\bar{z}$,\n are similar. \nAny small differences are due to the fact that each selection produces a different $n(z)$ when individual PDFs are not symmetric, like the one shown in Figure \\ref{fig:fig1}.  \n\nIn the bottom panels we show the clustering ratios with respect to the true clustering when using PDF weights with different probability thresholds. To aid in the comparison, we also present the ratio for $\\hat{z}$ with the red dashed line. This allows us to both clean our sample, as if using a quality cut, and sample  \nmore narrow redshift bins. The thresholds considered are $p_{threshold}={0.0,0.1}$.  The signal depends on the cut on the selection of \nweighted galaxies. The stronger the cut, the cleaner the sample and the clustering amplitude increases, as well as the intrinsic $n(z)$. But this may also bias our results as we may be changing the average galaxy types in the sample, as discussed in \\pcite{marti14}. Here we considered a low threshold that is non-negligible to compare with the full PDF case.\n\nWe consider narrower bin configurations in order to test what happens as we approach the intrinsic photo-z dispersion error, summarized in Figure \\ref{fig:fig3}. \nWe see in the case when $\\Delta z=0.2$ that the amplitude of the photometric samples clustering decreases with respect to the  \ntrue redshift clustering. The angular clustering signal is proportional to $n(z)^2$, as explained by Equation (\\ref{eq:wtheta}), which in the top hat case means that it is inversely proportional to $(\\Delta z)^2$. Photometric samples distribution in true redshift are broader than the top hat bin and therefore, the signal amplitude is smaller. The bin considered in this case for \ngalaxy selection is  $0.9<z<1.1$. We see that the differences between the mode and the mean are bigger than in the previous case with $\\Delta z = 0.3$. This may be a result of the fact that when we consider bins much bigger than the intrinsic separations, the differences between photo-z single statistic estimators are smaller.\nAs we extend the comparison to smaller widths, $\\Delta z=0.15$ ($0.925<z<1.075$), the ratio between the angular clustering signal for the photometric samples and the sample with true redshift becomes smaller. This is in agreement with the trend we saw before,  as $w(\\theta)\\propto (1/\\Delta z)^2$ for true redshift clustering, while the photo-z dispersion keeps the corresponding signal diluted in the radial direction.\n\n\nThe case with $\\Delta z=0.1$ ($0.95<z<1.05$) shows the same trend than the previous cases with bigger bin widths. The ratio of the photometric redshift signals to the true redshift signal continues to decrease. The results with mean and mode estimators tend to converge as the bin width approaches the photo-z dispersion error. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm, width=0.45\\textwidth]{Fig7.pdf}\n\\caption{The evolution of the clustering amplitude at $\\theta=0.1$ for a redshift bin centered at $z=0.5$ with a given bin width, $\\Delta z$.

Therefore, increasing the number of bins beyond the limit in which the bin width is comparable with the photo-z error is not an efficient process for any photo-z estimator, at least from the point of view of a clustering measurement, especially for bins with a width smaller than $\\Delta z=0.15$, which is twice the mean photo-z error, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:fig3}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Bias measurement}\\label{sec:res3}\n\\subsubsection{PDF redshift distributions}\nWe next evaluate how the selection of galaxies in radial shells when\nusing different photo-$z$ statistics affects the information on \nthe linear galaxy bias $b_g$, as defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:bias}).
