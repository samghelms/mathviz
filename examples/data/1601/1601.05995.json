Such a discovery, recently awarded\nwith the Nobel Prize~\\cite{Nobel}, has been the first of a long series of milestones in our \nunderstanding of neutrinos, whose properties have been gradually clarified by the subsequent \nfindings of several other experiments performed with man-made neutrino sources (reactors and accelerators).\n\nThe two apparently disjoint effective 2-flavor descriptions initially introduced to explain separately the solar and the\natmospheric neutrino anomalies have been gradually recognized as two pieces of a single and \nmore complex mosaic, which is currently accepted as the standard picture of neutrino oscillations. \nSuch a 3-flavor framework involves two distinct mass-squared splittings ($\\Delta m^2_{31}$, $\\Delta m^2_{21}$), \nthree mixing angles ($\\theta_{12}$, $\\theta_{23}$, $\\theta_{13}$), and one CP-phase $\\delta$.\n\nThe latest fundamental step in the establishment of the 3-flavor scheme has been accomplished\nvery recently (during 2012), with the determination of the long-sought third mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ by \nmeans of dedicated reactor experiments~\\cite{An:2015rpe,RENO:2015ksa,Abe:2014bwa}.\nThis discovery  has opened \nthe way to the measurement of the last unknown 3-flavor parameters: the CP-phase $\\delta$ \nand the neutrino mass hierarchy (MH), i.e. the sign of $\\Delta m^2_{31}$.  Both properties are at the center \nof an intense world-wide research program, which will be carried out with new accelerator, reactor \nand atmospheric neutrino experiments (for a recent review see~\\cite{Stanco:2015ejj}). \n\nIn spite of its tremendous success and of its beautiful structure the standard 3-flavor framework\nmay not constitute the ultimate description of neutrinos, which may reserve surprises. In fact, a few anomalies\nhave been recorded at the short baseline experiments, which cannot be accommodated in the 3-flavor scheme\n(see~\\cite{Abazajian:2012ys,Palazzo:2013me,Gariazzo:2015rra} for a review of the topic).\nThe two standard mass-squared splittings $\\Delta m^2_{21} \\equiv m^2_2 - m^2_1$ and $\\Delta m^2_{31} \\equiv m^2_3 - m^2_1$\nare too small to produce observable effects in such setups and (at least) one new much larger mass-squared \ndifference $O(\\mathrm{eV}^2)$ must be introduced. The hypothetical fourth mass eigenstate must be essentially\nsterile. A rich and diverse program of new more sensitive short-baseline experiments is underway in order to test\nsuch an intriguing hypothesis (see the review in~\\cite{Lasserre:2014ita}), which, if confirmed would represent a revolution in our understanding\nof neutrinos, as important as the discovery of neutrino oscillations.\n\nAt a phenomenological level, the existence of sterile neutrinos would make necessary to extend\nthe standard 3-flavor framework. The enlarged scheme must be realized in such a way to preserve\nthe very good description of all the other (non short-baseline) data. In the minimal extension, involving only one\nsterile species, the so-called  $3+ 1$ scheme, the new mass eigenstate $\\nu_4$ is assumed to\nbe weakly mixed with the active neutrino flavors ($\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$) and it is separated from the standard \nmass eigenstates $(\\nu_1, \\nu_2, \\nu_3)$ by a large $O(\\mathrm{eV}^2)$ splitting, giving rise to the hierarchical\npattern $|\\Delta m^2_{21}| \\ll |\\Delta m^2_{31}| \\ll |\\Delta m^2_{41}|$. The 3+1 scheme involves six\nmixing angles and three (Dirac) CP-violating phases. Hence, in case of discovery of a sterile neutrino, \nwe would face the formidable challenge of identifying six more properties (3 mixing angles, 2 CP-phases and the sign of\n$\\Delta m^2_{41}$) in addition to those involved in the standard 3-flavor framework.\n \n\nThe $3+1$ scheme naturally predicts sizable effects at the short baselines, where the oscillating factor\n$\\Delta_{41} \\equiv \\Delta m^2_{41}L /4E$ ($L$ being the baseline and $E$ the neutrino energy) is of order one, \nand one expects an oscillating behavior with the characteristic $L/E$ dependency. However,\nit must be emphasized that sterile neutrinos are observable in other (non-short-baseline) types of experiments\nwhere they may manifest in a more subtle way. In the solar sector, for example, a non zero-value\nof the electron neutrino mixing with $\\nu_4$ (parametrized by the matrix element $U_{e4}$) can be felt as\na small deviation of the unitarity of the $(\\nu_1, \\nu_2,\\nu_3)$ sub-system~\\cite{Palazzo:2011rj,Palazzo:2012yf} \n(see also~\\cite{Giunti:2009xz}). In the atmospheric sector, as first evidenced in~\\cite{Nunokawa:2003ep}, at very \nhigh [$O$(TeV)] energies one expects a novel MSW resonance, which may reveal as a distortion of the zenith\nangle distribution. To this regard we mention the dedicated analysis underway in the IceCube collaboration whose\npreliminary results have been shown very recently in~\\cite{IceCube-Sterile-CPAN-2015}. Complementary\ninformation on sterile neutrino mixing using atmospheric neutrinos has been also extracted from  \nSuper-Kamiokande~\\cite{Abe:2014gda}.\n\nSterile neutrino oscillations can influence also the long-baseline (LBL) accelerator experiments\n\n\\footnote{In this paper we focus on the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ channel. However,\ninformation on sterile neutrinos can be obtained also from the LBL disappearance \n$\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\mu$ searches and from the neutral current data. See the analyses performed\nby MINOS~\\cite{Timmons:2015lga,Adamson:2011ku}. Also the appearance $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$ channel\ncan provide information, albeit currently the low statistics limits the sensitivity. See the\nanalysis performed by OPERA~\\cite{Agafonova:2015neo}.}.\n\nWe recall that these setups, when working in the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$  (and $\\bar \\nu_\\mu \\to \\bar \\nu_e$)\nappearance channel,\ncan probe the 3-flavor CP-violating phenomena encoded by the CP-phase $\\delta$.\nTheir sensitivity is related to the fact that at long distances the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ transition probability develops a \nsmall interference term (which is completely negligible at SBL) between the oscillations induced by the \natmospheric splitting and those driven by the (much smaller) solar splitting. As first evidenced in~\\cite{Klop:2014ima},\nin the presence of sterile neutrinos a new interference term appears in the transition probability, which depends\non one additional CP-phase. Notably, the size of the new non-standard 4-flavor interference term is expected to be\nsimilar to that of the standard 3-flavor interference term. \nTherefore, the sensitivity to the new interference term can disclose the possibility\nto explore the new enlarged CP-violation (CPV) sector, which involves two additional CP-phases.  \nIt should  be stressed that both in the 3-flavor and 4-flavor schemes the CP-phases cannot be observed in SBL\nexperiments, since in such setups the two standard oscillating frequencies have negligible values.\nTherefore, the LBL and SBL experiments are complementary in the exploration of the 3+1 scheme \n(and of any scheme involving more than one sterile neutrino).   \n  \nThis basic observation provides the motivation for the study performed in the present paper, in which we\nexplore the physics potential of the two currently running LBL experiments T2K and NO$\\nu$A in the presence of a \nhypothetical light sterile neutrino.\n\n\\footnote{Old works on sterile neutrinos at LBL can be found in~\\cite{Donini:2001xy,Donini:2001xp,Donini:2007yf,Dighe:2007uf,Donini:2008wz,Yasuda:2010rj,Meloni:2010zr,Bhattacharya:2011ee,Donini:2012tt}. More recent \nstudies focusing on the future LBNE/DUNE experiment~\\cite{Acciarri:2015uup} have been recently performed\nin~\\cite{Hollander:2014iha,Berryman:2015nua,Gandhi:2015xza}. In principle, the CERN-Pyh\\\"asalmi baseline of 2290 km \nactively studied under the umbrella of the LBNO collaboration~\\cite{Agarwalla:2011hh,Agarwalla:2013kaa} can also be very sensitive to these issues. The same is also true for the future T2HK experiment~\\cite{Abe:2014oxa,Abe:2015zbg}, \nwhich is a bigger version of T2K.}\n\nThe analyses performed in~\\cite{Klop:2014ima,Palazzo:2015gja} with the existing data from T2K and NO$\\nu$A have\nalready shown that these two experiments\n\n\\footnote{In principle (see the 4-flavor analysis performed in~\\cite{Palazzo:2015wea}), the CP-phases can impact \nalso the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ searches of ICARUS~\\cite{Antonello:2012pq,Antonello:2015jxa} and OPERA~\\cite{Agafonova:2013xsk}.\nHowever, the very low statistics prevents to extract any information on the phases.}\n\ncan probe one of the new CP-phases for realistic values of the\nmixing angles indicated by the global 3+1 fits~\\cite{Giunti:2013aea, Kopp:2013vaa}. In addition, \nin~\\cite{Palazzo:2015gja} it has been pointed out that the statistical significance of the current\nindications concerning the standard CP-phase $\\delta$ and the neutrino mass hierarchy is modified (reduced)\nin the presence of sterile neutrinos. Therefore, it is timely and interesting to investigate if such features are expected\nto persist even when the full exposure will be reached in both experiments. With this aim, we perform a prospective\nstudy addressing in a quantitative way these questions.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section~\\ref{sec:probability}, we present a detailed discussion of the behavior of the \n4-flavor $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ and  $\\bar\\nu_\\mu \\to \\bar\\nu_e$ transition probabilities. \nFor the first time we extend the bi-probability representation, commonly \nused in the 3-flavor framework, to the more general 3+1 scheme. \nSection~\\ref{experimental-details} deals with the experimental details and also discusses the bi-events plots.\nIn section~\\ref{simulation-details}, we describe the details of the statistical method that we use for the analysis.\nSection~\\ref{results} is devoted to the presentation of the results of the sensitivity study of T2K and NO$\\nu$A. \nWe draw our conclusions in section~\\ref{Conclusions}. \n\n \n\\section{Conversion probability in the 3+1 scheme}\n\\label{sec:probability}\n\\subsection{Theoretical framework}\n\nIn the presence of a sterile neutrino $\\nu_s$, the mixing among the flavor and the \nmass eigenstates is described by a $4\\times4$ matrix.

In both figures we have assumed \nnormal hierarchy and we have taken the mass-squared difference \n$\\Delta m^2_{41} = 1$ eV$^2$ and fixed the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ and the\ntwo mixing angles $\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$ at the benchmark values\nindicated in the second column of table~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}, where we also report all the other mass-mixing \nparameters involved in the calculations. For such high values of the \nmass-squared splitting, the oscillating factor $\\Delta_{14}$ is very large and the \nsterile-induced oscillations are completely averaged out by the finite energy resolution of the detector.\nHence, we report the transition probability obtained after that such an averaging process\nhas been taken into account. In each plot of Figs.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-probability} and \\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-probability}\nthe value of the standard CP-phase $\\delta_{13}$ is kept fixed  at the value displayed in the legend,\nwhile the new phase $\\delta_{14}$ assumes four representative values.\nIn each panel, the 3-flavor probability is represented by a thick black line,\nwhile the four 3+1 cases are displayed by thin colored lines. The magenta\ncurve corresponds to $\\delta_{14} = -\\pi/2$, the blue one to  $\\delta_{14} = \\pi/2$,\nthe red one to $\\delta_{14} = 0$ and the green one to $\\delta_{14} = \\pi$.\nFor clarity, we will adopt such color convention in all the figures presented in the paper.\nFrom Figs.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-probability} and \\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-probability}\n it clearly emerges that the impact of the 4-flavor corrections\ninduced by a non-zero value of the mixing angles $\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$ \nis sizable. Their amplitude and shape depend on the particular value of the \nnew CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$.  The plots show that the most evident \neffect of the 4-flavor corrections is a change in the overall normalization\nof the transition probability with respect to the standard 3-flavor case. In addition,  \nan appreciably different energy dependence is also present, which reflects\nthe different dependency from the $L/E$ ratio of the standard interference\nterm [Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_int_1})] and the non-standard one [Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_int_2})].\nThe changes induced  in the overall\nnormalization are as big as the modifications induced by varying $\\delta_{13}$\n(compare the excursion of the black curves between different panels with the\nexcursion of the colored curve in a given panel). This confirms the analytical\nestimates made in the previous section.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Bi-Probability Plots}\n\\label{bi-probability}\n\n\nIn the 3-flavor framework, the behavior of the transition probability is often represented\nwith the CP-phase trajectory diagrams in bi-probability space, first introduced in~\\cite{Minakata:2001qm}.\nSuch plots, commonly dubbed as bi-probability plots, represent the \nparametric curves of the two transition probabilities ($\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_\\mu \\to \\bar\\nu_e$)\nwhere the varying parameter is the CP-phase $\\delta_{13}$. Since the two\ntransition probabilities are cyclic functions of the phase $\\delta_{13}$ the resulting contours form\na closed curve. This representation is particularly advantageous as it gives a bird-eye view\nof the salient features of a given experimental setups, in particular its sensitivity to MH and CPV.\nHere we attempt to generalize the bi-probability representation to the more general 4-flavor scheme.\nThis makes sense because also in the 4-flavor scheme the probability remains a cyclic function\nof the (more numerous) CP-phases. Also in this case, as we will show, this representation is very useful for the interpretation of the numerical results. In the following we first recall the basic features of the bi-probability plots in the standard 3-flavor framework, then we generalize our study to the 4-flavor scheme.    \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The 3-flavor case}\n\\label{bi-probability_3nu}\n\n\n In the 3-flavor case the neutrino and antineutrino transition probabilities can be written as\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu}\n P &=& P_0 + A (\\cos \\Delta \\cos{\\delta_{13}} - \\sin \\Delta \\sin{\\delta_{13}}) \\, \\\\\n \\label{eq:Parametric+3nu_nubar}\n \\bar P &=& \\bar P_0 + \\bar A (\\cos \\Delta \\cos{\\delta_{13}} + \\sin \\Delta \\sin{\\delta_{13}})\\,.\n \\end{eqnarray}\n\nIn general, due to the presence of matter effects one has $P_0 \\ne \\bar P_0$ and $ A\\ne \\bar A$.\nAs discussed in the previous section the matter effects shift\n\n\\footnote{$P_0$ and $\\bar P_0$ can be identified with $P^{\\rm {ATM}}_m$ of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_atm_matt}), where\nthe sign of the adimensional quantity $v$ related to the matter\neffects (for a fixed choice of the mass hierarchy) is opposite for neutrinos and antineutrinos.}\n\n$P_0$ by an amount  proportional to \nthe small parameter $v = 2VE/\\Delta m^2_{31}$, which is of order $O(\\epsilon)$. Therefore,\nsince $P_0$ in vacuum is $O(\\epsilon^2)$, the absolute shift of $P_0$ is $O(\\epsilon^3)$, which\nis thus comparable with the amplitude ($A \\simeq \\bar A$) of the interference term.\nThe amplitude of the interference term is also modified with respect to the vacuum case,  its\nrelative change being proportional to $v$. Since the amplitude $A$ is of order $O(\\epsilon^3)$, the corrections\nare of order $O(\\epsilon^4)$. Therefore, truncating the expansion of the probability at the third order\ncorresponds to consider $A = \\bar A$, with\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_A}\nA \\simeq 8 s_{13} s_{12} c_{12} s_{23} c_{23} (\\alpha\\Delta)\\sin\\Delta \\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe relations (\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric+3nu_nubar}) represent the parametric equations \nof an ellipse of center $(P_0,\\bar P_0)$. \nUnder the assumption $A = \\bar A$, as already shown in~\\cite{Minakata:2001qm}, the major (minor)\naxis of the ellipse is proportional to $\\sin \\Delta$ ($\\cos \\Delta$) and has \nan inclination of $-\\pi/4$ ($\\pi/4$). To see this one can perform a counter-clockwise rotation $R$\nof the parametric curve around its center $(P_0,\\bar P_0)$ by the angle $\\omega = \\pi/4$\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:R_ij_2dim}\n     R =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n         \\cos \\omega  &  -\\sin \\omega   \\\\\n         \\sin \\omega  &  \\cos \\omega\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    =\n     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\begin{bmatrix}\n         1  &  -1   \\\\\n         1  &  1\n    \\end{bmatrix}\\,,    \n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nobtaining for the rotated probabilities\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_rotated}\n P' &=& P_0 - \\sqrt{2} A \\sin \\Delta \\sin{\\delta_{13}} \\, \\\\\n \\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nubar_rotated}\n \\bar P' &=& \\bar P_0 + \\sqrt{2} A\\cos \\Delta \\cos{\\delta_{13}}\\,.\n \\end{eqnarray}\n\nFrom these relations one arrives at the equation of an ellipse in the canonical form \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\n \\frac{(P'-P_0)^2}{a^2} +\\frac{(\\bar P'-P_0)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\,,\n \\end{eqnarray}\n\nwith the two semi-axes having lengths   \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\na &=& \\sqrt{2}A\\sin \\Delta \\,, \\\\ \nb &=& \\sqrt{2}A\\cos \\Delta \\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe combination of signs in the parametric equations (\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_rotated})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nubar_rotated}) \nimplies that for the NH case the ``chirality'' of the ellipse is positive, i.e. the \ntrajectory winds in the counter-clockwise sense as the phase $\\delta_{13}$ increases.\nThe chirality is opposite (negative) in the IH case since the coefficient \nA changes its sign under a swap of the mass hierarchy [see Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_A})].\n\nThe energy spectrum of the neutrino beams employed in typical LBL experiments is peaked\naround the first oscillation maximum, where $\\Delta \\sim \\pi/2$ and therefore one expects  $a\\gg b$,\ni.e. the major axis much bigger than the minor one. This feature is particularly pronounced in \nT2K since, as already remarked in the previous section, the peak energy ($E=0.6\\,$GeV) almost \nexactly matches the condition $\\Delta = \\pi/2$. In this case the ellipse becomes almost degenerate with a line.\nThis behavior can be observed in Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}, where in all\nfour panels the two black curves correspond to the 3-flavor limit for the two cases of NH (solid line) \nand IH (dashed line).  The colored curves correspond to four representative  4-flavor cases\nthat will be discussed later. In the NO$\\nu$A experiment, at the peak energy ($E=2\\,$GeV)\nwe have $\\Delta = 0.4 \\pi$ and the ratio of the major over the minor axis is given by $a/b = \\tan \\Delta \\sim 3$, as one can \nappreciate from the  plots in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}, where again\nlike for T2K, we display the two cases of NH (black solid line) and IH (black dashed line).\n  \nThe bi-probability representation is particularly useful because it neatly shows that \nthe presence of matter effects tend to split the two ellipses corresponding to the two mass\nhierarchies, thus giving a qualitative bird-eye view of the sensitivity\nof a given experiment to the MH. In addition, the ellipse curves show pictorially \nthe effect of the genuine (or intrinsic) CPV due to $\\sin \\delta_{13}$,\ndisentangling it from the fake (or extrinsic) CPV induced by the matter effects.\nIn particular, for $\\delta_{13} =  (-\\pi/2, \\pi/2 )$ the representative point in the bi-probability\nspace (respectively a circle and a square) lies on the intercepts of the ellipse with the\nmajor axis and one has the maximal (intrinsic) CPV.\nConversely, the effect from the CP conserving $\\cos \\delta_{13}$ term is proportional\nto the length of the minor axis. For $\\delta_{13} = (0, \\pi)$ the representative point on the ellipse\n(respectively a triangle and an asterisk)  basically coincide. \n\n\nFrom the comparison of  Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability} and \nFig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}, it emerges that the splitting between \nthe NH and IH curves is less pronounced in T2K than in NO$\\nu$A. This \nis a consequence of the fact that, as already discussed in the previous section, \nthe matter effects are larger in the second experiment. It is useful to recall [see Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_atm_matt})]\nthat the matter effects induce modifications proportional to the dimensionless quantity \n$v = 2 VE/\\Delta m^2_{31}$, which is $v\\simeq 0.05$ at the T2K peak energy and $v \\simeq 0.17$ at\nthe NO$\\nu$A peak energy.                                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The 4-flavor case}\n\\label{bi-probability_4nu}\n\n\nIn the 3+1 scheme the transition probabilities have the general form\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v1}\nP &=& P_0 + A \\cos (\\Delta + \\delta_{13}) + B \\sin (\\Delta - \\delta_{14} + \\delta_{13})\\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v1}\n\\bar P &=& \\bar P_0 + \\bar A \\cos(\\Delta - \\delta_{13}) + \\bar B \\sin (\\Delta + \\delta_{14} - \\delta_{13})\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere, neglecting $O(\\epsilon^4)$ corrections, we have\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_A}\nA &\\simeq& \\bar A \\simeq S_A \\frac{\\alpha}{|\\alpha|}\\Delta\\sin\\Delta\\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_B}\nB &\\simeq& \\bar B \\simeq  S_B \\sin \\Delta\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nWe have introduced the two (positive definite) auxiliary quantities \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SA}\nS_A &=& 8 s_{13} s_{12} c_{12} s_{23} c_{23}|\\alpha| \\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SB}\nS_B &=& 4 s_{14} s_{24} s_{13} s_{23}\\,, \n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhich, for the specific values of the mixing angles under consideration (see the second \ntable of~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}) yield\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SAnum}\nS_A  &\\simeq& 0.8 \\times 10^{-2}\\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SBnum}\nS_B  &\\simeq& 10^{-2}\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nIn the expression of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ in Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_A})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_B})\nwe have left evident the dependency from the oscillation factor $\\Delta$ and from the sign of the ratio $\\alpha$.\nThis will be useful when discussing the role of the neutrino mass hierarchy. \nWe note that, under a swap of the MH (implying\n$\\Delta \\to -\\Delta$ and $\\alpha \\to -\\alpha$), both coefficients $A$ and $B$ change sign\nand therefore their product $AB$ remains unaltered and positive definite. \nThe equations~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v1})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v1})  \ncan be re-expressed in the form\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v2}\nP &=& P_0 + C \\cos{\\delta_{13}} + D \\sin{\\delta_{13}} \\, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v2}\n\\bar P &=& \\bar P_0 + \\bar C \\cos{\\delta_{13}} + \\bar D \\sin{\\delta_{13}}\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere the new coefficients $C,D, \\bar C, \\bar D$ depend on $\\Delta$ and \non the CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$ as follows\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_C}\nC &=& + A \\cos{\\Delta} + B \\sin{(\\Delta - \\delta_{14}}) \\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_D}\nD &=&  - A \\sin{\\Delta} + B \\cos{(\\Delta - \\delta_{14}})\\,,\\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_Cb}\n\\bar C &=& + \\bar A \\cos{\\Delta} + \\bar B \\sin{(\\Delta + \\delta_{14}}) \\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_Db}\n\\bar D &=&  + \\bar A \\sin{\\Delta} - \\bar B \\cos{(\\Delta + \\delta_{14}})\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nBy eliminating the CP-phase $\\delta_{13}$ from the expressions~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v2})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v2}), one easily arrives at the equation of an ellipse.\n\n\\footnote{If one makes explicit the dependency on $\\delta_{14}$ (instead of $\\delta_{13}$)\nand treats $\\delta_{14}$ as the varying parameter one still obtains \na (different) ellipse. In this case, the center of the ellipse depends on the value of $\\delta_{13}$.}\n\nHowever, the situation is more involved with respect to the 3-flavor case, because the geometrical \nproperties of the 4-flavor ellipse (length and inclination of the two axes) depend not only from $\\Delta$ \nbut also from the new CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$.\n\nFigures~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability} and \\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}\nrepresent the 4-flavor ellipses obtained respectively for T2K (at the energy $E= 0.6$\\,GeV)\nand NO$\\nu$A (at the energy $E= 2.0$\\,GeV) for four fixed values of the phase $\\delta_{14}$.\nIn each panel the solid (dashed) curve represents the NH (IH) case.

In the limit $\\sin \\delta_{14} \\to 0$ the inclination of \nthe major axis is $|\\omega| = \\pi/4$. In this case, the sign of $\\omega$ can be determined by looking\nat the sign of the numerator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v2}). If the numerator is positive,\none has $\\omega = -\\pi/4$, if it is negative one has $\\omega = \\pi/4$. \n\nIn T2K we have $\\Delta \\simeq \\pi/2$ and Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v2}) takes the simpler form \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}\n\\tan 2 \\omega  =  \\frac{S_A^2 \\Delta^2 -S_B^2}{2S_AS_B |\\Delta| \\sin \\delta_{14}} \\simeq \\frac{0.22}{\\sin \\delta_{14}}\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThis result is independent of the mass hierarchy and therefore the inclination of the ellipses\nwill be identical in the two cases of NH and IH. This is confirmed by Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}.\nIndeed, in each panel the solid ellipse has almost the same orientation of the dashed one. The very small difference\nin the inclinations is due to the matter effects [O($\\epsilon^4$)] that we are neglecting at the level of the interference terms.\nThe matter effects are instead retained at the level of the leading terms $P_0$ and $\\bar P_0$ where\nthey induce O($\\epsilon^3$) corrections. As a result the centers of the ellipses are shifted\nin opposite directions (with respect to the vacuum case) for the two cases of NH and IH. \nWe also observe that the centers of the 4-flavor ellipses almost coincide with those of the\n3-flavor ones since, as discussed in section~\\ref{sec:probability} [see Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_atm_matt})], \nthe matter effects enter in a similar way in the two schemes. The very small differences in the location \nof the centers of the 3-flavor and 4-flavor ellipses is imputable to corrections of order O($\\epsilon^4$), which \nare neglected  in our treatment.\nFor the two values $\\delta_{14} = (0, \\pi)$, the inclination of the major axis is $\\omega = -\\pi/4$\nsince the numerator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}) is positive in both cases. \nThis is confirmed by the first (red curves) and second (green curves) panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}. \nFor $\\delta_{14} = \\pm \\pi/2$, one has $\\tan 2 \\omega = \\pm 0.22$, approximately corresponding to $\\omega \\simeq \\pm 0.11$ (or $\\pm 6^0$). In the case $\\delta_{14} = -\\pi/2$, the sign of the denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}) \n is negative and the inclination of $-6^0$ is that of the major axis. In the case $\\delta_{14} = \\pi/2$, the sign of the denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}) is positive and the inclination of $+6^0$ is that of the minor axis. This behavior is corroborated by the third panel (magenta curves) and fourth panel (blue curves) of \nFig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}.\n\n\n\nIn NO$\\nu$A we have $\\Delta \\simeq 0.4 \\pi$ and Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v2}) takes the form \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v4}\n\\tan 2 \\omega = k_1 \\frac{1 \\mp k_2 \\cos \\delta_{14}}{\\sin \\delta_{14}} \\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere the two constants $k_1,k_2$ are given by\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:contants_ab}\nk_1 &\\simeq&  3.85 \\times 10^{-3}\\,,\\\\ \nk_2 &\\simeq& 1.53 \\times  10^{2}\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe minus (plus) sign in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v4}) refers to the case of NH (IH).\nSo at the NO$\\nu$A peak energy, which corresponds to a value of $\\Delta$ different\nfrom $\\pi/2$, differently from T2K, we expect a dependency of the orientation of the ellipse from the mass hierarchy. For the two values $\\delta_{14} = (0, \\pi)$ the denominator goes to zero so the absolute inclination of the ellipses is $|\\omega| = \\pi/4$. The sign of $\\omega$ is determined by the sign of the numerator, which in the normal hierarchy case is negative for $\\delta_{14} = 0$ and\npositive for $\\delta_{14} = \\pi$. Therefore, in the NH case the inclination of the major axis is\n$\\pi/4$ for $\\delta_{14} = 0$ and $-\\pi/4$ for $\\delta_{14} = \\pi$. In the IH case the situation is reversed, since the sign in the numerator in  \nEq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v4}) is opposite.\nThis behavior is basically confirmed by the first two panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}.\nComing now to the two cases $\\delta_{14} = \\pm \\pi/2$,  one has $\\tan 2\\omega = k_1/\\sin \\delta_{14}$, which is a relation independent of the neutrino mass hierarchy. Due to the small value\nof the coefficient $k_1$, the value of $\\omega$ is approximately zero. The inclination refers to the \nmajor (minor) axis for $\\delta_{14} = -\\pi/2$ ($\\delta_{14} = \\pi/2$). This behavior is confirmed \nby the numerical results displayed in the third and fourth panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}. \n \nHence, one can see that for both experiments the relatively simple formulae illustrated above allow us to explain analytically \nall the properties of the ellipses displayed in Figs.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability} and~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}, \nwhich are obtained by a full numerical calculation. In the case of T2K the formula for the inclination of the ellipse\nis accurate at the level of less than one degree. In NO$\\nu$A the accuracy, in some cases, is at the level of a few degrees, \ndue to the larger impact of the fourth order corrections related to matter effects. For clarity, in table~\\ref{table_ellipses}\nwe report the approximated properties of the ellipses for the 3-flavor and the 4-flavor cases.\n\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n{\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& $\\delta_{14} (\\rm true) $ & MH & Chirality & Inclination (T2K) & Inclination (NO$\\nu$A) \\\\\n\\hline\n {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{3$\\nu$}}}&  & NH & + & $-45^0$ & $-45^0$\\\\\n &  & IH & - & $-45^0$ & $-45^0$ \\\\\n\\hline\n {\\multirow{{8}}{{*}}{{4$\\nu$}}}& {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$0^0$}}} & NH & + & $-45^0$ & $+45^0$ \\\\\n &  & IH & + & $-45^0$  & $-45^0$ \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\n & {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$180^0$}}} & NH & - & $-45^0$ & $-45^0$ \\\\\n &  & IH  & - & $-45^0$ &$+45^0$ \\\\\n \\cline{2-6}\n  & {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$-90^0$}}} & NH & + & $-6^0$ & $0^0$ \\\\\n &  &IH  &+ & $-6^0$ & $0^0$\\\\\n \\cline{2-6}\n & {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$90^0$}}} & NH & - & $-84^0$ & $-90^0$ \\\\\n &  & IH  & - & $-84^0$ & $-90^0$\\\\\n \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n}\n\\caption{Geometrical properties of the ellipses for the 3-flavor and 4-flavor schemes.

The T2K experiment in Japan\nis collecting the data since 2010. Neutrinos are being produced at the \nJ-PARC accelerator facility in Tokai, and are being observed in the\n22.5 kton (fiducial) Super-Kamiokande water \\v{C}erenkov detector \nat Kamioka, at a distance of 295 km from the source at an off-axis \nangle of $2.5^\\circ$~\\cite{Itow:2001ee}. Due to the off-axis nature \nof the beam~\\cite{Para:2001cu}, it peaks sharply at the first oscillation \nmaximum of 0.6 GeV. Another major benefit of using the off-axis \ntechnique is that it helps to reduce the intrinsic ${\\nu_e}$ contamination \nin the beam and also the background coming from neutral current \nevents, improving the signal-to-background ratio by great extent.\nAs a result, the T2K experiment has already been able to provide\nan important breakthrough to establish the three-flavor paradigm by \nobserving the $\\theta_{13}$-driven appearance signal in \n$\\nu_{\\mu}\\rightarrow\\nu_{e}$ oscillation channel~\\cite{Abe:2013hdq}. \nIn May 2014, T2K started its operation in the antineutrino mode, and \nafter collecting 10\\% of their expected antineutrino data set, recently\nthey have announced the first appearance results in the antineutrino \nchannel~\\cite{T2K_antineutrino_EPS_HEP_2015,Salzgeber:2015gua}, \nclearly taking a first step towards probing the CP symmetry in a direct \nfashion. As mentioned earlier, in this paper,\nwe consider the full projected exposure of $7.8 \\times 10^{21}$ \nprotons on target (p.o.t.) which the T2K experiment plans to \nachieve during their entire run with a proton beam power of \n750 kW and with a proton energy of 30 GeV. We also assume \nthat the T2K experiment would use half of its full exposure in \nthe neutrino mode which is $3.9 \\times 10^{21}$ p.o.t. and the\nremaining half would be used during antineutrino run. We follow\nthe recent publication by the T2K collaboration~\\cite{Abe:2014tzr} \nin great detail to simulate the signal and background event spectra \nand their total rates to obtain our final results. Following the same\nreference~\\cite{Abe:2014tzr}, we assume an uncorrelated \n5\\% normalization error on signal and 10\\% normalization error on \nbackground for both the appearance and disappearance channels\nto analyze the prospective data from the T2K experiment. We use\nthe same set of systematics for both the neutrino and antineutrino \nchannels which are also uncorrelated.\n\nThe US-based long-baseline experiment NO$\\nu$A is currently taking\ndata. It uses a 14 kton liquid scintillator far detector at Ash River, Minnesota \nto detect the oscillated NuMI\\footnote{Neutrinos at the Main Injector.} \nmuon neutrino beam produced at Fermilab~\\cite{Ayres:2007tu,Patterson:2012zs,Childress:2013npa}.\nThe NO$\\nu$A far detector is placed 810 km away from the source at \nan off-axis angle of 14 mrad ($0.8^\\circ$) with respect to the beam line, \nand sees a narrow-band beam which peaks around 2 GeV.\nBased on the exposure of $2.74 \\times 10^{20}$ p.o.t., recently, \nthe NO$\\nu$A experiment has released their first ${\\nu_e}$ \nappearance data providing a solid evidence of ${\\nu_{\\mu}} \\to {\\nu_e}$\noscillation over a baseline of 810 km which is the longest baseline \nin operation now~\\cite{NOvA_appearance_seminar_FNAL_2015,Bian:2015opa,Adamson:2016tbq,Adamson:2016xxw}.\nIn this work, we take the full projected exposure of $3.6 \\times 10^{21}$ p.o.t. \nwhich the NO$\\nu$A experiment aims to use during their full running time\nwith a NuMI beam power of 700 kW and 120 GeV proton energy~\\cite{Ayres:2007tu}.\nIn our simulation, we assume that NO$\\nu$A would also use 50\\%\nof its full exposure in the neutrino mode which is $1.8 \\times 10^{21}$ p.o.t. \nand the remaining 50\\% would be utilized to collect the data in the \nanti-neutrino mode. Following references~\\cite{Agarwalla:2012bv,Patterson:2012zs,Agarwalla:2013ju},\nwe estimate the signal and background event spectra and their total\nrates in our calculations. We use a simplified systematic treatment \nfor NO$\\nu$A: an uncorrelated 5\\% normalization uncertainty on signal \nand 10\\% normalization uncertainty on background for both the appearance \nand disappearance channels. This is true for both the neutrino and \nantineutrino modes which are also assumed to be uncorrelated.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth, height=0.49\\textwidth]{T2K-Event-spectra.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth, height=0.49\\textwidth]{NoVA-Events-spectra.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Expected signal event spectra in the ${\\nu_e}$ appearance channel \nas a function of the reconstructed neutrino energy.

The number of expected \nappearance electron events\\footnote{We can calculate the number of positron \nevents using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:events}), by taking into account appropriate oscillation \nprobability and cross-section. The same strategy can be applied to estimate \n$\\mu^{\\pm}$ events.} in the $i$-th energy bin in the detector is estimated \nusing the following well known expression\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 16982, "prevtext": "\n\nis the constant matter potential along the neutrino trajectory in the earth crust.  \nBoth in T2K and in NO$\\nu$A the value of $v$ is relatively small, being $v\\sim 0.05$ in T2K,  \nand $v\\sim 0.17$ in NO$\\nu$A, where we have taken as a benchmark  value the peak energy \n($E = 0.6$ GeV in T2K, $E = 2$ GeV in NO$\\nu$A).

In this section we present,\nfor completeness, also the bi-events plots, where on the two axes it is represented\nthe theoretical value of number of events ($\\nu_e$ on the x-axis, $\\bar \\nu_e$ on the y-axis)\nexpected in a given experiment. Such plots provide a more precise information on the behavior of a given experiment,\nbecause the event rates take into account the complete energy spectrum \nand provide the information on the statistics involved in the experiment.  \n\n \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{bieventsd13-d140-novav1.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{bieventsd13-d14180-novav1.pdf}\n}\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{bieventsd13-d14270-novav1.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{bieventsd13-d1490-novav1.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Bi-events plots for NO$\\nu$A for four fixed values of $\\delta_{14}$.\nIn each panel, we also show the 3-flavor ellipses for the sake of comparison.\nIn both the 3-flavor and 4-flavor ellipses, the running parameter is\nthe CP-phase $\\delta_{13}$ varying in the range $[-\\pi,\\pi]$.

Apart from an obvious deformation factor due \nto the different scale used for the events, we can appreciate other\ndifferences, which are introduced by the contribution of several \nenergies in the integration. In particular, appreciable differences\nare now visible between the two cases of NH and IH. \nMost importantly, figure~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-events} gives a clear feeling\non the number of events expected in the experiment T2K.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-events} shows the bi-events plots for NO$\\nu$A.\nThe comparison with the corresponding bi-probability plot in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}\nshows that the geometrical properties of the ellipses are quite similar to those obtained \nfor the probabilities. This is due to the fact the the energy spectrum\nof NO$\\nu$A is more sharp than the T2K one (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:event-spectrum}).\n As a consequence the peak energy is more important in determining the global behavior of the \ntotal rate. Finally, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:convoluted-bi-event} we show the convolution plot \nin the bi-event space, which gives a visual information on the degree of separation\nof the two neutrino mass hierarchies.  \n \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{bieventsv-t2k.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{bieventsv-nova.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{The colored shaded blobs represent the convolution of the bi-events graphs \nfor T2K (left panel) and NO$\\nu$A (right panel) in the 3+1 scheme.

We include the 4-flavor\neffects both in the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ appearance channel and in the \n$\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\mu$ disappearance channel. We have found\nthat, for the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\mu$ disappearance channel, the survival probability is very close\nto the 3-flavor case, in agreement with the analytical considerations made in~\\cite{Klop:2014ima}.\nWe consider\nthe true value of ${\\sin^2 2\\theta_{13}}$ to be 0.085 (see table~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters})\nto generate the data and keep it fixed in the fit expecting that the Daya\nBay experiment would be able to measure ${\\theta_{13}}$ with a very high-precision\n($\\sim$ 3\\% relative precision at 1$\\sigma$ C.L.) by the end \nof 2017~\\cite{Zhan:2015aha}. As far as the atmospheric mass-squared splitting\nis concerned, we take the true value of $\\Delta m^2_{32}$ = $2.4 \\times 10^{-3}$\neV$^2$ ($ - 2.4 \\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$) for NH (IH). Accordingly, we take\n $\\Delta m^2_{31}$ = $2.475 \\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ ($ - 2.4 \\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$) for NH (IH). \nWe also do not marginalize over this parameter in the fit since the present precision on this parameter is \nalready quite good~\\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2014bfa}, and the future data from\nthe running T2K and NO$\\nu$A experiments would certainly improve this\nfurther~\\cite{Agarwalla:2013qfa,Abe:2014tzr}. This should remain true also in the presence\nof sterile neutrino oscillations because\nthe value of $\\Delta m_{31}^2$ is extracted from the $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\mu$ searches\nwhich, for the small values of the mixing angles $\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$\nconsidered in the present analysis (see table~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}), are almost unaffected \nby the 4-flavor effects. For ${\\theta_{23}}$, we consider the maximal mixing ($\\pi/4$) as the true choice, and \nin the fit, we marginalize over the range given in table~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}.\nWe marginalize over both the \nchoices of hierarchy in the fit for all the analyses, except for the mass hierarchy \ndiscovery studies where our aim is to exclude the wrong hierarchy in the fit.\nWe vary the true value of $\\delta_{13}$ in its allowed range of $[-\\pi, \\pi]$,\nand it has been marginalized over its full range in the fit if the performance \nindicator demands so. We take the line-averaged constant Earth matter \ndensity\\footnote{The line-averaged constant Earth matter density has been \ncomputed using the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM)~\\cite{PREM:1981}.} \nof 2.8 g/cm$^{3}$ for both the baselines. \n\nWe take the mass-squared splitting $\\Delta m^2_{41} = 1\\,$eV$^2$, which\nis the value currently suggested by the SBL anomalies. However, we stress that our\nresults would remain unaltered for different choices of such parameter, provided \nthat  $\\Delta m^2_{41} \\gtrsim 0.1\\,$eV$^2$. For such values, the fast\noscillations induced by the new large frequency get completely averaged\nbecause of the finite resolution of the detector. For the same reason, \nthe LBL setups are insensitive to the sign of $\\Delta m^2_{41}$ and\nwe can safely assume positive sign for it. Concerning the active-sterile \nmixing angles, we take the true value of 0.025 for both the $\\sin^2\\theta_{14}$ and \n$\\sin^2\\theta_{24}$ and keep them fixed in the fit.  \nThese values are close to the best fit obtained by the global 3+ fits~\\cite{Giunti:2013aea}.\nWe vary the true value of $\\delta_{14}$ in its allowed \nrange of [$-\\pi,\\pi$], and it has been marginalized over its full range in the fit \nas needed. We assume $\\sin^2\\theta_{34}$ = 0 and $\\delta_{34}$ = 0 in our\nsimulation.\n\n\\footnote{We recall that the vacuum $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ transition probability is independent\nof $\\theta_{34}$ (and $\\delta_{34}$). In matter, a tiny dependence appears which \nis more appreciable in NO$\\nu$A than in T2K (see the appendix of~\\cite{Klop:2014ima} for a detailed discussion).} \n\nIn our analysis, we do not explicitly consider the near detectors \nof T2K and NO$\\nu$A which may shed some light on $\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$, \nbut certainly, the near detector data are not sensitive to the CP-phases which is the main thrust \nof this work. In our simulation, we have performed a full spectral analysis using\nthe binned events spectra for both experiments. In the statistical analysis, \nthe Poissonian $\\Delta\\chi^{2}$ is marginalized over the \nuncorrelated systematic uncertainties (as mentioned in section~\\ref{experimental-details})\nusing the method of pulls as discussed in Refs.~\\cite{Huber:2002mx,Fogli:2002pt}. \nWhen showing the results, we display the $1,2,3\\sigma$ confidence levels for 1 d.o.f.\nusing the relation $\\textrm{n}\\sigma \\equiv \\sqrt{\\Delta\\chi^2}$.\nIn~\\cite{Blennow:2013oma}, it was shown that the above relation is valid in the\nfrequentist method of hypothesis testing.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Results of the Sensitivity Study}\n\\label{results}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{CP-violation Searches in the Presence of Sterile Neutrinos}\n\\label{CPV}\n\n\nIn this section we explore the impact of sterile neutrinos in the CPV searches of T2K and NO$\\nu$A.\nAs a first step we consider the discovery potential of the CPV induced by the standard 3-flavor CP-phase\n$\\delta_{13}$, which is proportional to $\\sin \\delta_{13}$. The discovery potential is defined as the\nconfidence level at which one can reject the test hypothesis of no CP-violation, i.e. the cases\n$\\delta_{13}=0$ and $\\delta_{13}=\\pi$. We have taken the best fit values of all the parameters at\nthe values specified in the second column of table~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}. In the 3-flavor scheme,\nwe marginalize over $\\theta_{23}$ and over the hierarchy. In the 3+1 scheme,\nin addition, we marginalize over the unknown value of $\\delta_{14}$.\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:cpv} we display the results of the numerical analysis. The upper panels refer to T2K, \nthe middle ones to NO$\\nu$A, and the lower ones\nto their combination. In the left (right) panels, we consider NH (IH) as the true hierarchy choice. In each panel, \nwe present the results obtained for the 3-flavor case (black solid curve) and for the 3+1 scheme, in which case\nwe select four different values of the true value of $\\delta_{14}$ (while its test value is left free to vary and is marginalized away). \nThe values of the phase $\\delta_{14}$ and the colors of the corresponding curves are the same of the previous plots. \nThe 3-flavor sensitivities (black curves) are in agreement with\nthose shown in the official analyses~\\cite{Abe:2014tzr}. We see that for all values of the new CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$ the discovery\npotential of the two experiments decreases with respect to that of the 3-flavor case. The loss of sensitivity\nis imputable to the degeneracy between the two CP-phases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$.  Similar to the 3-flavor case, \nthe discovery potential has a maximum for $\\delta_{13} = -90^0$  ($\\delta_{13} = 90^0$) for NH (IH). Abrupt changes\nin the sensitivity are evident in the range $[45^0, 135^0]$ for the NH case and in the range $[-135^0, -45^0]$ \nfor the IH case. This behavior can be traced to the degeneracy among the two CP-phases and the mass hierarchy. In fact,\nin these ranges the best fit is obtained for the false hierarchy. In the bi-events plots these ranges correspond to\npoints where the ellipses of the two hierarchies tend to overlap. \n\nUntil now we have considered only four selected values of the CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$. It is interesting\nto see what happens for a generic choice of such a parameter. To this purpose we have generalized the \nanalysis by treating $\\delta_{14}$ as a free parameter. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:cpv-true-delta13-delta14} \nwe show the iso-contour lines of the discovery potential of the CP-violation induced by $\\delta_{13}$\nas a function of the true values of the two phases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$. Inside the red regions\nthe discovery potential is larger than $2 \\sigma$. Inside the beige regions it is larger than $1 \\sigma$.\nThe plots refer to the combination T2K + NO$\\nu$A for the two cases of NH (left) and IH (right). One \ncan easily check that horizontal cuts of the contour plots made in correspondence of the four particular\nvalues of the phase $\\delta_{14}$ considered in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cpv} return the 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$\nintervals derivable from the last two panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cpv}. \n   \nIn the 3+1 scheme also the new CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$ can be a source of CP-violation.\nHence it is interesting to determine the discovery potential of the CPV induced\nby $\\sin \\delta_{14}$ alone and the {\\em total} CP-violation induced simultaneously by $\\sin \\delta_{13}$ and $\\sin \\delta_{14}$.\nOur numerical analysis shows that the discovery potential of non-zero $\\sin \\delta_{14}$\nis always below the 2$\\sigma$ level so we do not show the corresponding plot.\nInstead in Fig.~\\ref{fig:total-cpv} we show the results for the {\\em total} CPV discovery\nsince it is appreciably different (larger) from that induced by $\\sin \\delta_{13}$ alone. \nThe plots refer to the combination T2K + NO$\\nu$A for the two cases of NH (left) and IH (right).\nInside the small green regions the discovery potential is larger than $3 \\sigma$. Inside the red regions\nit is larger than $2 \\sigma$. Inside the beige regions it is larger than $1 \\sigma$.\nAs expected the regions in Fig.~\\ref{fig:total-cpv} contain as sub-regions those of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cpv-true-delta13-delta14} \nwhere the sole CPV induced by $\\sin \\delta_{13}$ is considered. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:total-cpv}  we can recognize nine white regions\nwhere the discovery potential is below 1$\\sigma$. We stress that these nine regions correspond to four physical regions because\nboth CP-phases are cyclic variables. Geometrically one can view the square represented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:total-cpv} \nas an unwrapped torus, provided one takes into account that the upper edge is connected with the lower edge, and \nthat left edge with the right one\\footnote{Formally one can see that the square is homeomorphic to the torus. \nTopologically the torus can be seen as the quotient space of the square.}.\nThese four regions contain the points where the total CPV is zero \ni.e. $\\sin \\delta_{13} = \\sin \\delta_{14} =0$. This condition is verified for the four (inequivalent) CP-conserving cases\n $[\\delta_{13}, \\delta_{14}] = [0,0]$, $[\\pi,0]$, $[0,\\pi]$, $[\\pi, \\pi]$ and all the other five combinations\nobtainable by a change of sign of one of (or both) the phases equal to $\\pi$. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\hskip0.5cm\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=19 cm,width= 17cm]{T2K-NovA-del14marginalized-Sterile-CPV-NH-IH-Merge.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Discovery potential of CP-violation induced by $\\sin \\delta_{13}$. \nUpper panels refer to T2K.

While this is certainly a very important feature,\na complementary information is provided by the capability of reconstructing the values\nof the two CP-phases, independent of the amount of CP-violation (if any).  \nFigure \\ref{fig:cp-reconstruction} gives a quantitative answer to such a different kind of question.\nThe four plots represent the regions reconstructed around four representative\npoints in the plane [$\\delta_{13}, \\delta_{14}$]. In all cases we have taken the NH as the true hierarchy \nin the data and then marginalized over NH and IH in theory.\nSimilar results (not shown) were obtained for the IH case.\nThe two upper panels refer to the CP-conserving cases $[0,0]$ and $[\\pi,\\pi]$ respectively.\nThe third and fourth panels refer to the two (maximally) CP-violating cases $[-\\pi/2, -\\pi/2]$\nand $[\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$. The two confidence levels refer to 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ (1 d.o.f.).\nWe see that in all cases we obtain a unique reconstructed region at the 1$\\sigma$ level.\nNote that this is true also in the second panel, because the four corners of the square\nform a connected region due to the cyclic properties of the two CP-phases.\nAt the 2$\\sigma$ level we obtain a unique region only in the case $[-\\pi/2, -\\pi/2]$ (bottom left).\nSmall spurious islands start to appear in the other cases. We have checked that these islands disappear if one\nassumes the prior knowledge of the correct mass hierarchy. In all cases the typical\n1$\\sigma$ uncertainty is about $40^0$ ($50^0$) for $\\delta_{13}$ ($\\delta_{14}$).\nAs recently shown in the 4-flavor analysis performed in~\\cite{Palazzo:2015gja}, the present data seem\nto indicate a slight preference for the combination $[\\delta_{13}, \\delta_{14}] = [-\\pi/2, -\\pi/2]$.\nIf this trend gets confirmed in a few years (assuming the existence of\na sterile neutrino), the picture should resemble that of the left bottom panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:cp-reconstruction}.  \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{cp-reconstruction-0-0-1dof.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{cp-reconstruction-180-180-1dof.pdf}\n}\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{cp-reconstruction-minus90-minus90-1dof.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{cp-reconstruction-plus90-plus90-1dof.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Reconstructed regions for the two CP-phases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$ for\nthe T2K + NO$\\nu$A combined setup, for the four choices of their true values indicated in each panel.\nThe NH is taken as the true hierarchy, while we have marginalized over the two possible hierarchies\nin the test model. The contours refer to 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ levels.}\n\\label{fig:cp-reconstruction}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Impact of Sterile Neutrinos on Mass Hierarchy Measurements}\n\\label{MH-Impact}\n\n\nIn this section we assess the discovery potential of the neutrino mass hierarchy. \nThis is defined as the confidence level at which one can exclude the false (or wrong)\ntest hierarchy given a data set generated with the true hierarchy. We have taken the best\nfit values of all the parameters as given in table~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}.\nIn the test model, we have marginalized over \n$\\delta_{13}$ and $\\theta_{23}$  within their full $3\\sigma$ range. In the 3+1 scheme\nwe have also marginalized over the CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$. In Fig.~\\ref {fig:mh} we\nshow the discovery potential of excluding the wrong hierarchy as a function \nof the true value of $\\delta_{13}$. The upper panels refer to T2K, the middle ones to NO$\\nu$A,\nand the lower ones to their combination. In the left (right) panels, \nwe consider NH (IH) as the true hierarchy choice. In each panel, we give the \nresults for the 3-flavor case (thick black curve) and for the 3+1 scheme (colored curves) \nfor four different values of the true $\\delta_{14}$ (that is $-90^0$, $90^0$, $0^0$ and $180^0$).\nThe color convention is the same adopted in the rest of the paper. \n\nWe observe that in T2K (upper panels) the discovery potential is quite limited both in the 3-flavor framework and in the 3+1\nscheme. This is due to the fact that the matter effects are small in T2K. Comparing the results\nof the 3+1 scheme (colored curves) with those of the 3-flavor one (black curve) we \nobserve that, apart for the case $\\delta_{14} = -90^0$ for NH ($\\delta_{14} = 90^0$ for IH),\nin all the other cases the discovery potential is smaller than the 3-flavor one. \nThe overall behavior of the 4-flavor curves is similar to that of the 3-flavor one. \nIn particular, the sensitivity presents a maximum at $\\delta_{13} = -90^0$ for NH. This similar behavior can be \nunderstood by observing that in the bi-events plots the point $\\delta_{13} = -90^0$\n(the squares in the four panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-events})\nalways provides the maximal separation from the cloud \ngenerated by the convolution of all the possible IH ellipses (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:convoluted-bi-event}).\nA similar observation can be done for the specular case of $\\delta_{13} =+90^0$ and IH.\n\nConcerning NO$\\nu$A (middle panels) we can make the following observations.\nSimilarly to T2K the maximal discovery potential is obtained for $\\delta_{13} = -90^0$ for NH \nand $\\delta_{13} = 90^0$ for IH. For such two values the representative points\non the ellipse (the squares for NH and the circles for IH in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-events}) always provide the\nmaximal separation from the convolution of all the ellipses of the opposite MH (see again Fig.~\\ref{fig:convoluted-bi-event}).\nHowever, there are also important differences with respect to T2K.\nFirst of all, we observe that the maximal discovery potential is much larger than that of T2K.\nThis is imputable to the fact that the matter effects are much bigger in NO$\\nu$A (see the discussion \nin section~\\ref{sec:probability}). Second, we can see that in the NH case (left middle panel) there is a good sensitivity \nnot only for $\\delta_{14} = -90^0$ (magenta curve) but also for $\\delta_{14} = 180^0$ (green curve).\nIn the IH case (right middle panel) there is a good sensitivity for $\\delta_{14} = 90^0$ (blue curve) \nand $\\delta_{14} = 0^0$ (red curve). This different behavior with respect to T2K\ncan be traced to the fact that in NO$\\nu$A the peak energy is not centered exactly at the first\noscillation maximum but at $\\Delta = 0.4\\pi$.  Finally, we notice that the combination of the two experiments\n(lower panels) is dominated by NO$\\nu$A. \n \n\nThe study of the discovery potential of the neutrino mass hierarchy can be generalized\nto the case in which the CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$ can assume any value in its variability range.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:mh-true-delta13-delta14} shows the results of such more general analysis,\nwhere we have treated $\\delta_{14}$ as a free parameter. We display the iso-contour lines of the \ndiscovery potential as a function of the true values of the two phases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$. \nInside the red regions the discovery potential is larger than $3 \\sigma$. Inside the blue regions it is larger than $2 \\sigma$.\nThe plots refer to the combination T2K + NO$\\nu$A for the two cases of NH (left) and IH (right). One \ncan easily check that horizontal cuts of the contour plots made in correspondence of the four particular\nvalues of the phase $\\delta_{14}$ considered in Fig.~\\ref{fig:mh} return the 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$\nintervals derivable from the last two panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mh}. \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\hskip0.5cm\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[height=19 cm,width= 17cm]{T2K-NovA-del14marginalized-Sterile-MH-NH-IH-Merge.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Discovery potential for excluding the wrong hierarchy as a function \nof true $\\delta_{13}$.

We have presented a detailed discussion of the behavior\nof the 4-flavor $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_\\mu \\to \\bar\\nu_e$ transition probabilities, \nextending for the first time the bi-probability representation, commonly used in the 3-flavor framework, \nto the 3+1 scheme. We have also performed a comprehensive sensitivity study of the two experiments\n(taken alone and in combination) in order to assess their discovery potential in the presence \nof a sterile neutrino species. We have considered realistic benchmark values of the \n3+1 mass-mixing parameters as inferred from the existing global short-baseline fits.\nWe found that the performance of both the experiments\nin claiming the discovery of the CP-violation induced by the standard CP-phase\n$\\delta_{13} \\equiv \\delta$, and the neutrino mass hierarchy \nget substantially deteriorated.\nThe degree of loss of sensitivity depends on the value of the unknown CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$.\nWe have also assessed the discovery potential of total CP-violation (i.e., induced simultaneously by \nthe two CP-phases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$) and the capability\nof the two experiments of reconstructing the true values of such CP-phases.\nThe typical (1$\\sigma$ level) uncertainty on the reconstructed phases   \nis approximately $40^0$ for $\\delta_{13}$ and $50^0$ for $\\delta_{14}$.\n\nIn the eventuality of a discovery of a sterile neutrino at the new short-baseline experiments,\nwe will face two challenges. First, we will have to reassess the status of the\n3-flavor parameters whose best fit values will change in the 3+1 scheme.\nAmong the 3-flavor properties, the most sensitive to the perturbations\ninduced by the sterile neutrino oscillations are the CP-phase $\\delta$, and \nthe neutrino mass hierarchy. In both cases, their determination is based on \nthe observation of very tiny effects which, in the LBL setups, can be appreciably\nperturbed by new interference phenomena induced by the sterile neutrinos.\nOur study gives the first quantitative assessment of the discovery potential of \nthe 3-flavor CPV and of the MH for the two LBL experiments T2K and NO$\\nu$A.\nThe second, perhaps more stimulating challenge, will be that of determining \nall the new parameters that govern the enlarged 3+1 scheme.  According to our\nstudy, T2K and NO$\\nu$A may be able to give the first indications on one\nof the new CP-phases involved in the 3+1 scheme. The future\nLBL experiments (DUNE, LBNO and T2HK) will be needed to extract \nmore robust information on the enlarged CP-violation sector. We hope that\nthe comprehensive analysis presented in this paper may play an important role \nin exploring light sterile neutrinos at the long baseline facilities.\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}\n\n\nS.K.A. is supported by the DST/INSPIRE Research Grant [IFA-PH-12],\nDepartment of Science \\& Technology, India.

In both figures we have assumed \nnormal hierarchy and we have taken the mass-squared difference \n$\\Delta m^2_{41} = 1$ eV$^2$ and fixed the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ and the\ntwo mixing angles $\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$ at the benchmark values\nindicated in the second column of table~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}, where we also report all the other mass-mixing \nparameters involved in the calculations. For such high values of the \nmass-squared splitting, the oscillating factor $\\Delta_{14}$ is very large and the \nsterile-induced oscillations are completely averaged out by the finite energy resolution of the detector.\nHence, we report the transition probability obtained after that such an averaging process\nhas been taken into account. In each plot of Figs.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-probability} and \\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-probability}\nthe value of the standard CP-phase $\\delta_{13}$ is kept fixed  at the value displayed in the legend,\nwhile the new phase $\\delta_{14}$ assumes four representative values.\nIn each panel, the 3-flavor probability is represented by a thick black line,\nwhile the four 3+1 cases are displayed by thin colored lines. The magenta\ncurve corresponds to $\\delta_{14} = -\\pi/2$, the blue one to  $\\delta_{14} = \\pi/2$,\nthe red one to $\\delta_{14} = 0$ and the green one to $\\delta_{14} = \\pi$.\nFor clarity, we will adopt such color convention in all the figures presented in the paper.\nFrom Figs.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-probability} and \\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-probability}\n it clearly emerges that the impact of the 4-flavor corrections\ninduced by a non-zero value of the mixing angles $\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$ \nis sizable. Their amplitude and shape depend on the particular value of the \nnew CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$.  The plots show that the most evident \neffect of the 4-flavor corrections is a change in the overall normalization\nof the transition probability with respect to the standard 3-flavor case. In addition,  \nan appreciably different energy dependence is also present, which reflects\nthe different dependency from the $L/E$ ratio of the standard interference\nterm [Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_int_1})] and the non-standard one [Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_int_2})].\nThe changes induced  in the overall\nnormalization are as big as the modifications induced by varying $\\delta_{13}$\n(compare the excursion of the black curves between different panels with the\nexcursion of the colored curve in a given panel). This confirms the analytical\nestimates made in the previous section.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Bi-Probability Plots}\n\\label{bi-probability}\n\n\nIn the 3-flavor framework, the behavior of the transition probability is often represented\nwith the CP-phase trajectory diagrams in bi-probability space, first introduced in~\\cite{Minakata:2001qm}.\nSuch plots, commonly dubbed as bi-probability plots, represent the \nparametric curves of the two transition probabilities ($\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_\\mu \\to \\bar\\nu_e$)\nwhere the varying parameter is the CP-phase $\\delta_{13}$. Since the two\ntransition probabilities are cyclic functions of the phase $\\delta_{13}$ the resulting contours form\na closed curve. This representation is particularly advantageous as it gives a bird-eye view\nof the salient features of a given experimental setups, in particular its sensitivity to MH and CPV.\nHere we attempt to generalize the bi-probability representation to the more general 4-flavor scheme.\nThis makes sense because also in the 4-flavor scheme the probability remains a cyclic function\nof the (more numerous) CP-phases. Also in this case, as we will show, this representation is very useful for the interpretation of the numerical results. In the following we first recall the basic features of the bi-probability plots in the standard 3-flavor framework, then we generalize our study to the 4-flavor scheme.    \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The 3-flavor case}\n\\label{bi-probability_3nu}\n\n\n In the 3-flavor case the neutrino and antineutrino transition probabilities can be written as\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu}\n P &=& P_0 + A (\\cos \\Delta \\cos{\\delta_{13}} - \\sin \\Delta \\sin{\\delta_{13}}) \\, \\\\\n \\label{eq:Parametric+3nu_nubar}\n \\bar P &=& \\bar P_0 + \\bar A (\\cos \\Delta \\cos{\\delta_{13}} + \\sin \\Delta \\sin{\\delta_{13}})\\,.\n \\end{eqnarray}\n\nIn general, due to the presence of matter effects one has $P_0 \\ne \\bar P_0$ and $ A\\ne \\bar A$.\nAs discussed in the previous section the matter effects shift\n\n\\footnote{$P_0$ and $\\bar P_0$ can be identified with $P^{\\rm {ATM}}_m$ of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_atm_matt}), where\nthe sign of the adimensional quantity $v$ related to the matter\neffects (for a fixed choice of the mass hierarchy) is opposite for neutrinos and antineutrinos.}\n\n$P_0$ by an amount  proportional to \nthe small parameter $v = 2VE/\\Delta m^2_{31}$, which is of order $O(\\epsilon)$. Therefore,\nsince $P_0$ in vacuum is $O(\\epsilon^2)$, the absolute shift of $P_0$ is $O(\\epsilon^3)$, which\nis thus comparable with the amplitude ($A \\simeq \\bar A$) of the interference term.\nThe amplitude of the interference term is also modified with respect to the vacuum case,  its\nrelative change being proportional to $v$. Since the amplitude $A$ is of order $O(\\epsilon^3)$, the corrections\nare of order $O(\\epsilon^4)$. Therefore, truncating the expansion of the probability at the third order\ncorresponds to consider $A = \\bar A$, with\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_A}\nA \\simeq 8 s_{13} s_{12} c_{12} s_{23} c_{23} (\\alpha\\Delta)\\sin\\Delta \\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe relations (\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric+3nu_nubar}) represent the parametric equations \nof an ellipse of center $(P_0,\\bar P_0)$. \nUnder the assumption $A = \\bar A$, as already shown in~\\cite{Minakata:2001qm}, the major (minor)\naxis of the ellipse is proportional to $\\sin \\Delta$ ($\\cos \\Delta$) and has \nan inclination of $-\\pi/4$ ($\\pi/4$). To see this one can perform a counter-clockwise rotation $R$\nof the parametric curve around its center $(P_0,\\bar P_0)$ by the angle $\\omega = \\pi/4$\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:R_ij_2dim}\n     R =\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n         \\cos \\omega  &  -\\sin \\omega   \\\\\n         \\sin \\omega  &  \\cos \\omega\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    =\n     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt 2}\\begin{bmatrix}\n         1  &  -1   \\\\\n         1  &  1\n    \\end{bmatrix}\\,,    \n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nobtaining for the rotated probabilities\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_rotated}\n P' &=& P_0 - \\sqrt{2} A \\sin \\Delta \\sin{\\delta_{13}} \\, \\\\\n \\label{eq:Parametric_3nu_nubar_rotated}\n \\bar P' &=& \\bar P_0 + \\sqrt{2} A\\cos \\Delta \\cos{\\delta_{13}}\\,.\n \\end{eqnarray}\n\nFrom these relations one arrives at the equation of an ellipse in the canonical form \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\n \\frac{(P'-P_0)^2}{a^2} +\\frac{(\\bar P'-P_0)^2}{b^2} = 1 \\,,\n \\end{eqnarray}\n\nwith the two semi-axes having lengths   \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\na &=& \\sqrt{2}A\\sin \\Delta \\,, \\\\ \nb &=& \\sqrt{2}A\\cos \\Delta \\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe combination of signs in the parametric equations (\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_rotated})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nubar_rotated}) \nimplies that for the NH case the ``chirality'' of the ellipse is positive, i.e. the \ntrajectory winds in the counter-clockwise sense as the phase $\\delta_{13}$ increases.\nThe chirality is opposite (negative) in the IH case since the coefficient \nA changes its sign under a swap of the mass hierarchy [see Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_3nu_nu_A})].\n\nThe energy spectrum of the neutrino beams employed in typical LBL experiments is peaked\naround the first oscillation maximum, where $\\Delta \\sim \\pi/2$ and therefore one expects  $a\\gg b$,\ni.e. the major axis much bigger than the minor one. This feature is particularly pronounced in \nT2K since, as already remarked in the previous section, the peak energy ($E=0.6\\,$GeV) almost \nexactly matches the condition $\\Delta = \\pi/2$. In this case the ellipse becomes almost degenerate with a line.\nThis behavior can be observed in Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}, where in all\nfour panels the two black curves correspond to the 3-flavor limit for the two cases of NH (solid line) \nand IH (dashed line).  The colored curves correspond to four representative  4-flavor cases\nthat will be discussed later. In the NO$\\nu$A experiment, at the peak energy ($E=2\\,$GeV)\nwe have $\\Delta = 0.4 \\pi$ and the ratio of the major over the minor axis is given by $a/b = \\tan \\Delta \\sim 3$, as one can \nappreciate from the  plots in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}, where again\nlike for T2K, we display the two cases of NH (black solid line) and IH (black dashed line).\n  \nThe bi-probability representation is particularly useful because it neatly shows that \nthe presence of matter effects tend to split the two ellipses corresponding to the two mass\nhierarchies, thus giving a qualitative bird-eye view of the sensitivity\nof a given experiment to the MH. In addition, the ellipse curves show pictorially \nthe effect of the genuine (or intrinsic) CPV due to $\\sin \\delta_{13}$,\ndisentangling it from the fake (or extrinsic) CPV induced by the matter effects.\nIn particular, for $\\delta_{13} =  (-\\pi/2, \\pi/2 )$ the representative point in the bi-probability\nspace (respectively a circle and a square) lies on the intercepts of the ellipse with the\nmajor axis and one has the maximal (intrinsic) CPV.\nConversely, the effect from the CP conserving $\\cos \\delta_{13}$ term is proportional\nto the length of the minor axis. For $\\delta_{13} = (0, \\pi)$ the representative point on the ellipse\n(respectively a triangle and an asterisk)  basically coincide. \n\n\nFrom the comparison of  Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability} and \nFig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}, it emerges that the splitting between \nthe NH and IH curves is less pronounced in T2K than in NO$\\nu$A. This \nis a consequence of the fact that, as already discussed in the previous section, \nthe matter effects are larger in the second experiment. It is useful to recall [see Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_atm_matt})]\nthat the matter effects induce modifications proportional to the dimensionless quantity \n$v = 2 VE/\\Delta m^2_{31}$, which is $v\\simeq 0.05$ at the T2K peak energy and $v \\simeq 0.17$ at\nthe NO$\\nu$A peak energy.                                                      \n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{The 4-flavor case}\n\\label{bi-probability_4nu}\n\n\nIn the 3+1 scheme the transition probabilities have the general form\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v1}\nP &=& P_0 + A \\cos (\\Delta + \\delta_{13}) + B \\sin (\\Delta - \\delta_{14} + \\delta_{13})\\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v1}\n\\bar P &=& \\bar P_0 + \\bar A \\cos(\\Delta - \\delta_{13}) + \\bar B \\sin (\\Delta + \\delta_{14} - \\delta_{13})\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere, neglecting $O(\\epsilon^4)$ corrections, we have\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_A}\nA &\\simeq& \\bar A \\simeq S_A \\frac{\\alpha}{|\\alpha|}\\Delta\\sin\\Delta\\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_B}\nB &\\simeq& \\bar B \\simeq  S_B \\sin \\Delta\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nWe have introduced the two (positive definite) auxiliary quantities \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SA}\nS_A &=& 8 s_{13} s_{12} c_{12} s_{23} c_{23}|\\alpha| \\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SB}\nS_B &=& 4 s_{14} s_{24} s_{13} s_{23}\\,, \n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhich, for the specific values of the mixing angles under consideration (see the second \ntable of~\\ref{tab:benchmark-parameters}) yield\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SAnum}\nS_A  &\\simeq& 0.8 \\times 10^{-2}\\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_SBnum}\nS_B  &\\simeq& 10^{-2}\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nIn the expression of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ in Eqs.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_A})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_B})\nwe have left evident the dependency from the oscillation factor $\\Delta$ and from the sign of the ratio $\\alpha$.\nThis will be useful when discussing the role of the neutrino mass hierarchy. \nWe note that, under a swap of the MH (implying\n$\\Delta \\to -\\Delta$ and $\\alpha \\to -\\alpha$), both coefficients $A$ and $B$ change sign\nand therefore their product $AB$ remains unaltered and positive definite. \nThe equations~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v1})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v1})  \ncan be re-expressed in the form\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v2}\nP &=& P_0 + C \\cos{\\delta_{13}} + D \\sin{\\delta_{13}} \\, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v2}\n\\bar P &=& \\bar P_0 + \\bar C \\cos{\\delta_{13}} + \\bar D \\sin{\\delta_{13}}\\,,\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere the new coefficients $C,D, \\bar C, \\bar D$ depend on $\\Delta$ and \non the CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$ as follows\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_C}\nC &=& + A \\cos{\\Delta} + B \\sin{(\\Delta - \\delta_{14}}) \\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_D}\nD &=&  - A \\sin{\\Delta} + B \\cos{(\\Delta - \\delta_{14}})\\,,\\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_Cb}\n\\bar C &=& + \\bar A \\cos{\\Delta} + \\bar B \\sin{(\\Delta + \\delta_{14}}) \\,, \\\\\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_coeff_Db}\n\\bar D &=&  + \\bar A \\sin{\\Delta} - \\bar B \\cos{(\\Delta + \\delta_{14}})\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nBy eliminating the CP-phase $\\delta_{13}$ from the expressions~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nu_v2})-(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_nubar_v2}), one easily arrives at the equation of an ellipse.\n\n\\footnote{If one makes explicit the dependency on $\\delta_{14}$ (instead of $\\delta_{13}$)\nand treats $\\delta_{14}$ as the varying parameter one still obtains \na (different) ellipse. In this case, the center of the ellipse depends on the value of $\\delta_{13}$.}\n\nHowever, the situation is more involved with respect to the 3-flavor case, because the geometrical \nproperties of the 4-flavor ellipse (length and inclination of the two axes) depend not only from $\\Delta$ \nbut also from the new CP-phase $\\delta_{14}$.\n\nFigures~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability} and \\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}\nrepresent the 4-flavor ellipses obtained respectively for T2K (at the energy $E= 0.6$\\,GeV)\nand NO$\\nu$A (at the energy $E= 2.0$\\,GeV) for four fixed values of the phase $\\delta_{14}$.\nIn each panel the solid (dashed) curve represents the NH (IH) case.

If the numerator is positive,\none has $\\omega = -\\pi/4$, if it is negative one has $\\omega = \\pi/4$. \n\nIn T2K we have $\\Delta \\simeq \\pi/2$ and Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v2}) takes the simpler form \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}\n\\tan 2 \\omega  =  \\frac{S_A^2 \\Delta^2 -S_B^2}{2S_AS_B |\\Delta| \\sin \\delta_{14}} \\simeq \\frac{0.22}{\\sin \\delta_{14}}\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThis result is independent of the mass hierarchy and therefore the inclination of the ellipses\nwill be identical in the two cases of NH and IH. This is confirmed by Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}.\nIndeed, in each panel the solid ellipse has almost the same orientation of the dashed one. The very small difference\nin the inclinations is due to the matter effects [O($\\epsilon^4$)] that we are neglecting at the level of the interference terms.\nThe matter effects are instead retained at the level of the leading terms $P_0$ and $\\bar P_0$ where\nthey induce O($\\epsilon^3$) corrections. As a result the centers of the ellipses are shifted\nin opposite directions (with respect to the vacuum case) for the two cases of NH and IH. \nWe also observe that the centers of the 4-flavor ellipses almost coincide with those of the\n3-flavor ones since, as discussed in section~\\ref{sec:probability} [see Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Pme_atm_matt})], \nthe matter effects enter in a similar way in the two schemes. The very small differences in the location \nof the centers of the 3-flavor and 4-flavor ellipses is imputable to corrections of order O($\\epsilon^4$), which \nare neglected  in our treatment.\nFor the two values $\\delta_{14} = (0, \\pi)$, the inclination of the major axis is $\\omega = -\\pi/4$\nsince the numerator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}) is positive in both cases. \nThis is confirmed by the first (red curves) and second (green curves) panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}. \nFor $\\delta_{14} = \\pm \\pi/2$, one has $\\tan 2 \\omega = \\pm 0.22$, approximately corresponding to $\\omega \\simeq \\pm 0.11$ (or $\\pm 6^0$). In the case $\\delta_{14} = -\\pi/2$, the sign of the denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}) \n is negative and the inclination of $-6^0$ is that of the major axis. In the case $\\delta_{14} = \\pi/2$, the sign of the denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v3}) is positive and the inclination of $+6^0$ is that of the minor axis. This behavior is corroborated by the third panel (magenta curves) and fourth panel (blue curves) of \nFig.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability}.\n\n\n\nIn NO$\\nu$A we have $\\Delta \\simeq 0.4 \\pi$ and Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v2}) takes the form \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v4}\n\\tan 2 \\omega = k_1 \\frac{1 \\mp k_2 \\cos \\delta_{14}}{\\sin \\delta_{14}} \\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere the two constants $k_1,k_2$ are given by\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:contants_ab}\nk_1 &\\simeq&  3.85 \\times 10^{-3}\\,,\\\\ \nk_2 &\\simeq& 1.53 \\times  10^{2}\\,.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe minus (plus) sign in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v4}) refers to the case of NH (IH).\nSo at the NO$\\nu$A peak energy, which corresponds to a value of $\\Delta$ different\nfrom $\\pi/2$, differently from T2K, we expect a dependency of the orientation of the ellipse from the mass hierarchy. For the two values $\\delta_{14} = (0, \\pi)$ the denominator goes to zero so the absolute inclination of the ellipses is $|\\omega| = \\pi/4$. The sign of $\\omega$ is determined by the sign of the numerator, which in the normal hierarchy case is negative for $\\delta_{14} = 0$ and\npositive for $\\delta_{14} = \\pi$. Therefore, in the NH case the inclination of the major axis is\n$\\pi/4$ for $\\delta_{14} = 0$ and $-\\pi/4$ for $\\delta_{14} = \\pi$. In the IH case the situation is reversed, since the sign in the numerator in  \nEq.~(\\ref{eq:Parametric_4nu_omega_v4}) is opposite.\nThis behavior is basically confirmed by the first two panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}.\nComing now to the two cases $\\delta_{14} = \\pm \\pi/2$,  one has $\\tan 2\\omega = k_1/\\sin \\delta_{14}$, which is a relation independent of the neutrino mass hierarchy. Due to the small value\nof the coefficient $k_1$, the value of $\\omega$ is approximately zero. The inclination refers to the \nmajor (minor) axis for $\\delta_{14} = -\\pi/2$ ($\\delta_{14} = \\pi/2$). This behavior is confirmed \nby the numerical results displayed in the third and fourth panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}. \n \nHence, one can see that for both experiments the relatively simple formulae illustrated above allow us to explain analytically \nall the properties of the ellipses displayed in Figs.~\\ref{fig:T2K-appearance-bi-probability} and~\\ref{fig:NOvA-appearance-bi-probability}, \nwhich are obtained by a full numerical calculation. In the case of T2K the formula for the inclination of the ellipse\nis accurate at the level of less than one degree. In NO$\\nu$A the accuracy, in some cases, is at the level of a few degrees, \ndue to the larger impact of the fourth order corrections related to matter effects. For clarity, in table~\\ref{table_ellipses}\nwe report the approximated properties of the ellipses for the 3-flavor and the 4-flavor cases.\n\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n{\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n& $\\delta_{14} (\\rm true) $ & MH & Chirality & Inclination (T2K) & Inclination (NO$\\nu$A) \\\\\n\\hline\n {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{3$\\nu$}}}&  & NH & + & $-45^0$ & $-45^0$\\\\\n &  & IH & - & $-45^0$ & $-45^0$ \\\\\n\\hline\n {\\multirow{{8}}{{*}}{{4$\\nu$}}}& {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$0^0$}}} & NH & + & $-45^0$ & $+45^0$ \\\\\n &  & IH & + & $-45^0$  & $-45^0$ \\\\\n\\cline{2-6}\n & {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$180^0$}}} & NH & - & $-45^0$ & $-45^0$ \\\\\n &  & IH  & - & $-45^0$ &$+45^0$ \\\\\n \\cline{2-6}\n  & {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$-90^0$}}} & NH & + & $-6^0$ & $0^0$ \\\\\n &  &IH  &+ & $-6^0$ & $0^0$\\\\\n \\cline{2-6}\n & {\\multirow{{2}}{{*}}{{$90^0$}}} & NH & - & $-84^0$ & $-90^0$ \\\\\n &  & IH  & - & $-84^0$ & $-90^0$\\\\\n \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n}\n\\caption{Geometrical properties of the ellipses for the 3-flavor and 4-flavor schemes.

The result of this exercise is shown in figure~\\ref{fig:convoluted-bi-probability},\nwhich has been produced by drawing the convolution of all the ellipses\n\n\\footnote{A similar plot has been shown in~\\cite{Friedland:2012tq} for the experiment NO$\\nu$A to visualize \nthe impact of new CP-phases potentially related to non-standard neutrino interactions.}\n\nobtained with a dense grid for the parameter $\\delta_{14}$ \nin its range of variability $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. Alternatively, Fig.~\\ref{fig:convoluted-bi-probability} may be seen as a dense \nscatter plot obtained by varying simultaneously both CP-phases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$.\nThis plot provides a bird-eye view of the degree of separation of the two \nneutrino mass hierarchies in the 3+1 scheme.

This means that there \nwill exist some combinations of the two CP-phases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$ (corresponding\nto those points which do not lie in the superposition area of the blue and orange regions) for which it will \nbe possible to distinguish between the two hierarchies at some non-zero confidence level. \nThe numerical analysis of the section~\\ref{results} will allow us to determine such specific combinations\nof the two CP-phases and the exact confidence level of the separation of the two hierarchies.\n\n  \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{biprobv-t2k.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{biprobv-nova.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{The colored shaded blobs represent the convolution of the bi-probability graphs \nfor T2K (left panel) and NO$\\nu$A (right panel) in the 3+1 scheme.

The T2K experiment in Japan\nis collecting the data since 2010. Neutrinos are being produced at the \nJ-PARC accelerator facility in Tokai, and are being observed in the\n22.5 kton (fiducial) Super-Kamiokande water \\v{C}erenkov detector \nat Kamioka, at a distance of 295 km from the source at an off-axis \nangle of $2.5^\\circ$~\\cite{Itow:2001ee}. Due to the off-axis nature \nof the beam~\\cite{Para:2001cu}, it peaks sharply at the first oscillation \nmaximum of 0.6 GeV. Another major benefit of using the off-axis \ntechnique is that it helps to reduce the intrinsic ${\\nu_e}$ contamination \nin the beam and also the background coming from neutral current \nevents, improving the signal-to-background ratio by great extent.\nAs a result, the T2K experiment has already been able to provide\nan important breakthrough to establish the three-flavor paradigm by \nobserving the $\\theta_{13}$-driven appearance signal in \n$\\nu_{\\mu}\\rightarrow\\nu_{e}$ oscillation channel~\\cite{Abe:2013hdq}. \nIn May 2014, T2K started its operation in the antineutrino mode, and \nafter collecting 10\\% of their expected antineutrino data set, recently\nthey have announced the first appearance results in the antineutrino \nchannel~\\cite{T2K_antineutrino_EPS_HEP_2015,Salzgeber:2015gua}, \nclearly taking a first step towards probing the CP symmetry in a direct \nfashion. As mentioned earlier, in this paper,\nwe consider the full projected exposure of $7.8 \\times 10^{21}$ \nprotons on target (p.o.t.) which the T2K experiment plans to \nachieve during their entire run with a proton beam power of \n750 kW and with a proton energy of 30 GeV. We also assume \nthat the T2K experiment would use half of its full exposure in \nthe neutrino mode which is $3.9 \\times 10^{21}$ p.o.t. and the\nremaining half would be used during antineutrino run. We follow\nthe recent publication by the T2K collaboration~\\cite{Abe:2014tzr} \nin great detail to simulate the signal and background event spectra \nand their total rates to obtain our final results. Following the same\nreference~\\cite{Abe:2014tzr}, we assume an uncorrelated \n5\\% normalization error on signal and 10\\% normalization error on \nbackground for both the appearance and disappearance channels\nto analyze the prospective data from the T2K experiment. We use\nthe same set of systematics for both the neutrino and antineutrino \nchannels which are also uncorrelated.\n\nThe US-based long-baseline experiment NO$\\nu$A is currently taking\ndata. It uses a 14 kton liquid scintillator far detector at Ash River, Minnesota \nto detect the oscillated NuMI\\footnote{Neutrinos at the Main Injector.} \nmuon neutrino beam produced at Fermilab~\\cite{Ayres:2007tu,Patterson:2012zs,Childress:2013npa}.\nThe NO$\\nu$A far detector is placed 810 km away from the source at \nan off-axis angle of 14 mrad ($0.8^\\circ$) with respect to the beam line, \nand sees a narrow-band beam which peaks around 2 GeV.\nBased on the exposure of $2.74 \\times 10^{20}$ p.o.t., recently, \nthe NO$\\nu$A experiment has released their first ${\\nu_e}$ \nappearance data providing a solid evidence of ${\\nu_{\\mu}} \\to {\\nu_e}$\noscillation over a baseline of 810 km which is the longest baseline \nin operation now~\\cite{NOvA_appearance_seminar_FNAL_2015,Bian:2015opa,Adamson:2016tbq,Adamson:2016xxw}.\nIn this work, we take the full projected exposure of $3.6 \\times 10^{21}$ p.o.t. \nwhich the NO$\\nu$A experiment aims to use during their full running time\nwith a NuMI beam power of 700 kW and 120 GeV proton energy~\\cite{Ayres:2007tu}.\nIn our simulation, we assume that NO$\\nu$A would also use 50\\%\nof its full exposure in the neutrino mode which is $1.8 \\times 10^{21}$ p.o.t. \nand the remaining 50\\% would be utilized to collect the data in the \nanti-neutrino mode. Following references~\\cite{Agarwalla:2012bv,Patterson:2012zs,Agarwalla:2013ju},\nwe estimate the signal and background event spectra and their total\nrates in our calculations. We use a simplified systematic treatment \nfor NO$\\nu$A: an uncorrelated 5\\% normalization uncertainty on signal \nand 10\\% normalization uncertainty on background for both the appearance \nand disappearance channels. This is true for both the neutrino and \nantineutrino modes which are also assumed to be uncorrelated.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth, height=0.49\\textwidth]{T2K-Event-spectra.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth, height=0.49\\textwidth]{NoVA-Events-spectra.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Expected signal event spectra in the ${\\nu_e}$ appearance channel \nas a function of the reconstructed neutrino energy.
