Together with the Gorenstein projective and with the Gorenstein flat modules, they are the key elements of Gorenstein homological algebra. So it is natural to consider the question of the existence of the Gorenstein injective envelopes and covers. Their existence is known over Gorenstein rings (\\cite{enochs:00:relative}). It is also known (\\cite{enochs:12:gorenstein.injective.covers}) that when $R$ is a commutative noetherian ring such that  the character modules of Gorenstein injective modules are Gorenstein flat, then the class of Gorenstein injective modules is both enveloping and covering.\n\n\n\nWe extend these results to two sided noetherian rings (not necessarily commutative). More precisely, we show that when $R$ is a two sided noetherian ring and the character module of any Gorenstein injective left $R$-module is Gorenstein flat, the class of Gorenstein injective left $R$-modules is both enveloping and covering.\\\\\n \n Then we consider the relation between the Gorenstein injective modules and the strongly cotorsion modules. It is known that over a commutative noetherian ring $R$ of finite Krull dimension, any Gorenstein injective module is strongly cotorsion (\\cite{salarian:03: strongly cotorsion}). We prove that over such a ring the class of Gorenstein injective modules coincides with that of strongly cotorsion modules if and only if the ring $R$ is in fact Gorenstein.\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\n\nThroughout this section $R$ denotes an associative ring with unity.

We recall their definition (the opposite ring is denoted $R^{op}$):\\\\\n\\begin{definition} (\\cite{holm:09:duality}, Definition 2.1)\nA duality pair over a ring $R$ is a pair $(\\textsc{M},\\textsc{C})$ where $\\textsc{M}$ is a class of $R$-modules and $\\textsc{C}$ is a class of $R^{op}$-modules, subject to the following conditions:\\\\\n(1) For an $R$-module $M$, one has $M \\in \\textsc{M}$ if and only if $M^+ \\in \\textsc{C}$.\\\\\n(2) $\\textsc{C}$ is closed under direct summands and finite direct sums.\n\\end{definition}\n\nA duality pair $(\\textsc{M},\\textsc{C})$ is called (co)product closed if the class $\\textsc{M}$ is closed under (co)products in the category of all $R$-modules. \\\\\nA duality pair $(\\textsc{M},\\textsc{C})$ is called \\emph{perfect } if it is coproduct-closed, if $\\textsc{M}$ is closed under extensions, and if $R$ belongs to $\\textsc{M}$.\n\nWe also recall that a cotorsion pair $(\\mathcal{L}, \\mathcal{C})$  is \\emph{perfect} if $\\mathcal{C}$ is an enveloping class and $\\mathcal{L}$ is a covering class.\\\\\n\nThe following result is \\cite{holm:09:duality}, Theorem 3.1:\\\\\n\\textbf{Theorem}.

The class of Gorenstein injective modules is enveloping if and only if the class $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ is covering.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\nWe prove that if the ring $R$ is two sided noetherian and has the property that the character modules of Gorenstein injective left $R$-modules are Gorenstein flat right $R$-modules, then the class of Gorenstein injective modules is enveloping.\nSince the class $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ is closed under arbitrary direct sums, it suffices to prove that $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ is the left half of a duality pair. Then by \\cite{holm:09:duality}, Theorem 3.1 (b), the class $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ is covering. By Theorem 1, $\\mathcal{GI}$ is enveloping in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe start with the following \\\\\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nLet $R$ be a two sided noetharin ring such that for any (left) Gorenstein injective module $M$, its character module, $M^+$ is a (right) Gorenstein flat module. Then a left $R$-module $K$ is in the class $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ if and only if its character module $K^+$ is in $\\mathcal{GF}^\\bot$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n$\\Rightarrow$ Let $K \\in ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$. For any Gorenstein flat right $R$-module $B$ we have $B^+ \\in \\mathcal{GI}$ (\\cite{holm:04:gorenstein}, Theorem 3.6). It follows that $Ext^1(K, B^+)=0$. Then $Ext^1 (B, K^+) \\simeq Ext^1 (K,B^+)=0$. So $K^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF}^ \\bot$.\\\\\n$\\Leftarrow$ Assume that $K$ is a left $R$-module such that $K^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF}^ \\bot$.\\\\\nSince $R$ is noetherian there exists an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow K \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow V \\rightarrow 0$ with $G$ Gorenstein injective and with $V \\in ^ \\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ (by Lemma 1). This gives an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow V^+ \\rightarrow G^+ \\rightarrow K^+ \\rightarrow 0$ with $G^+$ Gorenstein flat. Since $V \\in ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ we have that $V^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF}^ \\bot$. Since $K^+$ is also in $\\mathcal{GF}^ \\bot$ it follows that $G^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF} \\cap \\mathcal{GF}^ \\bot$. Thus $G^+$ is flat and therefore $G$ is injective (by \\cite{enochs:00:relative}, Theorem 3.2.16).\\\\\nSo we have an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow K \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow V \\rightarrow 0$ with $G \\in Inj \\subseteq ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ and with $V \\in ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$. Since $(^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GI})$ is a hereditary cotorsion pair, it follows that $K \\in ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$.\n\n\\end{proof}\n\nNow we can prove:\\\\\n\\begin{theorem}\nLet $R$ be a two sided noetherian ring such that the character modules of Gorenstein injective left $R$-modules are Gorenstein flat right $R$-modules. Then $(^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF}^\\bot)$ is a duality pair. In particular the class $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ is covering.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nBy Lemma 2 we have that $K \\in ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ if and only if $K^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF}^\\bot$.\\\\\nAny right orthogonal class (in particular $\\mathcal{GF}^\\bot$) is closed under direct products, and so it is closed under finite direct sums.\nAlso, any right orthogonal class (so $\\mathcal{GF}^\\bot$ in particular) is closed under direct summands.\\\\\nThus $(^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF}^\\bot)$  is a duality pair. Since the class $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ is closed under direct sums, it follows (by \\cite{holm:09:duality}, Theorem 3.1) that $^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$ is covering.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nLet $R$ be a two sided noetherian ring such that the character modules of Gorenstein injective left $R$-modules are Gorenstein flat right $R$-modules. Then the class of Gorenstein injective modules is enveloping.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThis follows from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe prove that over the same kind of rings the class of Gorenstein injective modules is also covering.\\\\\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nLet $R$ be a two sided noetherian ring such that the character modules of Gorenstein injective modules are Gorenstein flat. Then $(\\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF})$ is a duality pair.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n- We prove first that $K \\in \\mathcal{GI}$ if and only if $K^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF}$.\\\\\nOne implication is a hypothesis we made on the ring.\\\\\nAssume that $K^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF}$. Since the ring $R$ is left noetherian there exists an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow K \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow L \\rightarrow 0$ with $G$ Gorenstein injective and $L \\in ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$. Therefore we have an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow L^+ \\rightarrow G^+ \\rightarrow K^+ \\rightarrow 0$ with $G^+$ Gorenstein flat, and $L^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF}^\\bot$ (by Lemma 2). Then $Ext^1(K^+, L^+)=0$, so $G^+ \\simeq L^+ \\oplus K^+$, and therefore $L^+$ is a Gorenstein flat right $R$-module. It follows that $L^+ \\in \\mathcal{GF} \\bigcap \\mathcal{GF}^ \\bot$, so $L^+$ is a flat right $R$-module, and therefore $L$ is injective (by \\cite{enochs:00:relative}, Theorem 3.2.16). The exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow K \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow L \\rightarrow 0$ with $G$ Gorenstein injective and with $L$ injective, gives that $K$ has finite Gorenstein injective dimension. By \\cite{christensen:06:gorenstein} Lemma 2.18, there exists an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow H \\rightarrow K \\rightarrow 0$ with $B$ Gorenstein injective and with $id_R H = Gid_R K < \\infty$. This gives an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow K^+ \\rightarrow H^+ \\rightarrow B^+ \\rightarrow 0$. Both $B^+$ and $K^+$ are Gorenstein flat modules, so $H^+$ is also Gorenstein flat. Since $id_R H$ is finite it follows that $H^+$ has finite flat dimension (\\cite{enochs:00:relative}, Theorem 3.2.19). But a Gorenstein flat module of finite flat dimension is flat (\\cite{enochs:00:relative}, Corollary 10.3.4). So $H^+$ is flat and therefore $H$ is injective. Thus $Gid_R K =0$.\\\\\n\n- We can prove now that $(\\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF})$ is a duality pair.\\\\\nThe first condition from the definition holds by the above.\\\\\nIt is known that the class of Gorenstein flat modules is closed under (finite) direct sums, and under direct summands (\\cite{christensen:11:beyond}, Theorem 4.14).\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\nIn the proof of the result about the existence of the Gorenstein injective envelopes we will use the following lemma:\\\\\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nA direct sum of modules is a pure submodule of the direct product of the modules.\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $(X_i)_{i \\in I}$ be a family of $R$-modules. The direct sum $\\oplus_{i \\in I} X_i$ of the family is the direct limit of the finite direct sums $Y_j= \\oplus_{i \\le j} X_i$ of these modules. Any finite direct sum $Y_j$ is a direct summand of the direct product $Y = \\prod X_i$, so it is a pure submodule of $Y$. Therefore the sequence $ 0 \\rightarrow A \\otimes Y_j \\rightarrow A \\otimes Y $ is exact, for any $R$-module $A$. Then $0 \\rightarrow \\underrightarrow{lim} (A \\otimes Y_j) \\rightarrow \\underrightarrow{lim} (A \\otimes Y)$ is exact.\nSince the tensor product commutes with direct limits we have an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow A \\otimes (\\underrightarrow{lim} Y_j) \\rightarrow A \\otimes Y$. So $0 \\rightarrow A \\otimes (\\oplus_{i \\in I} X_i) \\rightarrow A \\otimes \\prod X_i $ is exact for any $R$-module $A$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\nLet $R$ be a two sided noetherian ring such that the character modules of Gorenstein injective left $R$-modules are Gorenstein flat right $R$-modules. Then the class of Gorenstein injective modules is covering in $R-Mod$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nBy Theorem 4, $(\\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF})$ is a duality pair. Then by \\cite{holm:09:duality} Theorem 3.1, the class of Gorenstein injective modules is closed under pure submodules. Since $\\mathcal{GI}$ is closed under direct products and every direct sum is a pure submodule of a direct product (Lemma 3), it follows that $\\mathcal{GI}$ is closed under arbitrary direct sums. Another application of \\cite{holm:09:duality}, Theorem 3.1 gives that $\\mathcal{GI}$ is covering.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following is an equivalent description of the condition that $(\\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF})$ is a duality pair.\\\\\n\n\\begin{proposition}\nLet $R$ be a two sided noetherian ring such the character modules of Gorenstein injective modules are Gorenstein flat. The following are equivalent:\\\\\n1. $(\\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF})$ is a duality pair;\\\\\n2. The class of Gorenstein injective modules, $\\mathcal{GI}$, is closed under pure submodules.\n\\end{proposition}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n1. $\\Rightarrow$ 2. follows from \\cite{holm:09:duality}, Theorem  3.1.\\\\\n2. $\\Rightarrow$ 1. Assume that $K^+$ is a right Gorenstein flat module.\\\\\nThe ring $R$ is noetherian so there is an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow K \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow L \\rightarrow 0$ with $G$ Gorenstein injective and with $L \\in ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$. \nBy the proof of Theorem 4, $G^+ \\simeq L^+ \\oplus K^+$, so the sequence $ 0 \\rightarrow K \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow L \\rightarrow 0$ is pure exact. Since $\\mathcal{GI}$ is closed under pure submodules it follows that $K$ is Gorenstein injective. Thus $K$ is Gorenstein injective if and only if its character module, $K^+$, is Gorenstein flat.\\\\\nSince the class of Gorenstein flat modules is closed under direct sums and under direct summands, it follows that $(\\mathcal{GI}, \\mathcal{GF})$ is a duality pair.\n\\end{proof}\n\nOur results hold over two sided noetherian rings with the property that the character modules of left Gorenstein injective modules are Gorenstein flat right $R$-modules. It is known that this class of rings includes the Gorenstein rings (\\cite{enochs:00:relative}), as well as the commutative noetherian rings with dualizing complexes (\\cite{holm:09:duality}). But these are not the only rings with this property. We proved (\\cite{iacob:14:gorenstein.flat.preenvelops}) that every two sided noetherian ring $R$ with $i.d._{R^{op}} R < \\infty$ has the desired property. \n\n\\begin{theorem}(\\cite{iacob:14:gorenstein.flat.preenvelops}, Theorem 2)\nLet $R$ be a two sided noetherian ring such that $i.d._{R^{op}} R \\le n$ for some positive integer n.

Then there is an exact sequence $0 \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow M \\rightarrow 0$ with $_RE$ an injective module. It follows that $Ext^i(-,M) \\simeq Ext^1(-,M)$ for all $i \\ge 1$.\\\\\nLet $_RX$ be a module of finite flat dimension. Since $R$ is left $n$-perfect, the projective dimension of $X$ is less than or equal to $n$. So $Ext^i(X,M) = 0$ for all $i > n$. Then by the above we have that $Ext^i(X,M) = 0$ for all $i \\ge 1$. Thus $M \\in \\mathcal{SC}$.\\\\\nIf $M'$ is a Gorenstein injective $R$-module then there exists a strongly Gorenstein injective module $M$ such that $M \\simeq M' \\oplus M\"$ (by \\cite{bennis:07:stronglygorenstein}).

It follows that $^\\bot \\mathcal{SC} = ^ \\bot \\mathcal{GI}$, that is, $\\mathcal{F} = ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$. Since $Inj \\subseteq ^\\bot \\mathcal{GI}$, it follows that every injective module has finite flat dimension.\\\\\nSince $R$ is right noetherian we have that $i.d._{R^{op}} R = sup \\{f.d.
