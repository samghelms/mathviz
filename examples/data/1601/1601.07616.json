There are several natural conditions that follow from causality constraints, but they are insufficient to completely determine the solution to this problem\\cite{Bousso2012,Czech2012,Hubeny2012,Almheiri2014,Jafferis2014}. There are toy models for which the problem can be studied more explicitly\\cite{Pastawski2015,Yang2015,Hayden2016}, but whether the insights obtained within these models can be applied more generally remains unclear.\n\n\nHamilton et al. provided a prescription\\cite{Hamilton2006} -- known as the AdS/Rindler reconstruction -- to reconstruct bulk local operators from the CFT;  operators can be reconstructed from a boundary subregion up to $1/N$ corrections if they lie in the causal wedge, i.e., a set of bulk points that can communicate back and forth with the given boundary region. Building upon a work of Morrison\\cite{Morrison2014}, the nature of this reconstruction was recently elucidated by Almheiri, Dong, and Harlow\\cite{Almheiri2014}. By identifying several puzzles that arise from this prescription, they concluded that the AdS/Rindler reconstruction should not be viewed as a statement about operators, but rather as a statement about operators that are restricted to some subspace; see also Ref.\\cite{Mintun2015} for an alternative proposal to evade the puzzles raised in Ref.\\cite{Almheiri2014}. They also considered a set of states that are generated by applying bounded number of bulk local operators on some state with a fixed semi-classical background. Their proposal, which we refer to as the ADH proposal, is that the subspace spanned by these vectors can be interpreted as a quantum error correcting code in a certain sense.\\footnote{Here we refrain from discussing Ref.\\cite{Mintun2015}, as our tools in the present form do not seem to yield any nontrivial conclusions for it at the moment.}\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to point out a nontrivial implication of the ADH proposal: that certain operators lying oustide of the causal wedge can be reconstructed as well. A crucial notion in this context is the entanglement wedge;  Given a boundary subregion $A$, the entanglement wedge is formally defined as the domain of dependence of a bulk spacelike surface whose boundary is a union of $A$ and the minimal surface that is anchored on the boundary of $A$\\cite{Czech2012,Wall2012,Headrick2014a,Jafferis2014}. The entanglement wedge is in general strictly larger than the causal wedge\\cite{Headrick2014a}, and it was recently conjectured that operators that lie in it can be reconstructed from the corresponding boundary subregion; see also \\cite{Czech2012,Wall2012}. This paper proves this conjecture within the proposal of Ref.\\cite{Almheiri2014} for certain choices of boundary regions, modulo the caveats discussed below.\n\nIn order to explain our result, it will be instructive to first discuss an idealized limit, in which the AdS/Rindler reconstruction for operators that are sufficiently well-localized in the causal wedge works perfectly  and the Ryu-Takayanagi(RT) formula holds without any quantum corrections. In this limit,  entanglement wedge reconstruction works perfectly for certain choices of boundary subregions; see Fig.\\ref{fig:Example} for an example. Of course, the reality is that we expect $1/N$ corrections to the AdS/Rindler reconstruction and quantum corrections to the RT formula\\cite{Lewkowycz2013,Faulkner2013}. We carefully analyze  these correction terms and study the various limits in which their combined effects vanish, at which point we arrive at the same conclusion as before.\n\nOur argument relies on the RT formula\\cite{Ryu2006} and a few elementary facts in quantum information theory. We observe that the RT formula imposes a nontrivial structure on the underlying state, and then study the implication of this structure using quantum information theory.  In the rest of the paper, we review the proposal of Ref.\\cite{Almheiri2014}, study the idealized limit in which the quantum correction vanishes, and then discuss the role of the correction terms.\n\nDuring the completion of this manuscript, Ref.\\cite{Dong2016} came to our attention, in which the authors addressed many of the same issues discussed herewithin. We include at the end of this manuscript a discussion of the similarities and differences between the two works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{ADH Proposal}\nIn Ref.\\cite{Almheiri2014}, the authors proposed to interpret  a certain subspace of a quantum gravity theory in pure AdS space as a quantum error correcting code. Here we review their proposal, making emphasis on the aspects that are pertinent to our analysis.\n\nOur analysis begins by first declaring the existence of some state $\\left|{\\Omega}\\right\\rangle$ which has a good semi-classical description.  As we said, we shall choose the underlying geometry to be that of the pure AdS space. One can formally consider a set of operators $\\phi_x$ at a bulk spacetime point $x$ and consider a subspace spanned by states of the form of $\\phi_x \\left|{\\Omega}\\right\\rangle$. Any subspace is formally a quantum error correcting code, but of course this in itself is a vacuous statement; one needs to specify how the subspace is embedded into a Hilbert space for which we have a good handle on its structure. The purported isometric equivalence of quantum gravity theory and CFT implies that these states can be isometrically embedded into the Hilbert space of the CFT.\n\nThe main body of the ADH proposal concerns the nature of this subspace on the CFT side. For any state in this subspace, we can consider an auxiliary system $R$ that purifies the state. The proposal states that for any such state\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\|\\rho_{A^cR} - \\rho_{A^c} \\otimes \\rho_R \\|_1 \\ll 1, \\label{eq:ADH_proposal}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\|\\rho_{A^{c}R}-\\rho_{A^{c}}\\otimes\\rho_{R}\\|_{1}\\ll 1,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mo>\u2225</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mi>c</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><msup><mi>A</mi><mi>c</mi></msup></msub><mo>\u2297</mo><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>R</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2225</mo></mrow><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u226a</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07616.tex", "nexttext": "\nfor any two reduced density matrices in the subspace\\footnote{Here the parameter that determines the smallness is smaller or equal to that of Eq.\\ref{eq:ADH_proposal}.}; see Appendix \\ref{section:appendix}.

Since the twist operator is primary, the result should only depend on the cross ratio between the four regions depicted in Fig.\\ref{fig:Example}. Specifically, setting the lengths of the two intervals of $A$ as $x_1,x_2$ and the lengths of the two intervals as $x_3,x_4$, the mutual information should be a function of $x=\\frac{x_1x_2}{x_3x_4}$. Its dependence on $x$ should scale as $x^{\\Delta}$, and as such, in $\\Delta \\to \\infty$ limit it is reasonable to expect it to vanish for $0<x<1.$ A missing part of the argument concerns the behavior of the OPE coefficient in this limit. As long as it grows subexponentially with $\\Delta$, our claim should remain intact. Intriguingly, extremal CFTs with  large central charge by definition should have this property\\cite{Witten2007}. Our work does not seem to shed any new light on the existence of such CFTs. However, it does strongly suggest that such a theory, if it is dual to the pure quantum gravity theory in (2+1)D AdS as conjectured in Ref.\\cite{Witten2007}, should admit entanglement wedge reconstruction.\n\nUnfortunately, this line of  reasoning is more limited to the well-studied instances of the AdS/CFT with extra compactified dimension. The mutual information will always contain a term of the form of $\\frac{1}{r^{\\Delta}}$, and the existence of the Kaluza-Klein excitations necessarily puts a nontrivial upper bound on $\\Delta$ according to the standard dictionary\\cite{Gubser1998,Witten1998}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe ADH proposal, whilst being a general framework that is independent of the details of the AdS/CFT correspondence, already puts a strong constraint on the precursor problem. The reason is that the states appearing in this context have a special universal structure that is inherited from the RT formula. Indeed, we were able to say something nontrivial about bulk operators that lie beyond the causal wedge by incorporating this fact.\n\nModulo our assumptions, our work constitute as a partial proof of the entanglement wedge conjecture. Of course, this is not without any deficiencies. Most importantly, the argument is based on the ADH proposal, and we did not justify this proposal from more fundamental principles. Also, our argument cannot be applied to operators that are located close to the causal/entangling surface, as such operators cannot be reconstructed from the boundary region in a standard quantum error correcting sense\\cite{Almheiri2014}. It is also worth noting that causal wedge and entanglement wedge differ from each other in general in asymptotically AdS space\\cite{Hubeny2012}, even for spherical boundary regions. A different line of reasoning seems necessary in order to study these cases.\n\nIn the language of quantum error correcting code, our analysis can be interpreted as enlarging a correctable region of the code from the assumptions about the codewords. The assumption used here is the RT formula, but an insight in a similar vein has been already commonly used in deriving fundamental tradeoff bounds for quantum error correcting codes.\\cite{Bravyi2009} It turns out that reformulating the problem this way and generalizing these insights leads to more fundamental constraints, as it shall be demonstrated elsewhere.\n\n\n\nWe note that the work of Dong, Harlow, and Wall\\cite{Dong2016} also makes significant progress on the causal wedge/entanglement wedge question.

Our explanation is based on a few well-known but nontrivial facts. As before, let us use $V$ to formally denote an isometry from the Hilbert space of the quantum gravity theory to the CFT Hilbert space. It is well-known that an isometry followed by a partial trace is precisely the linear map that is known as completely-positive trace preserving map\\cite{Nielsen2000}. Here we choose the partial trace to be over $A.$\n\nIt is well-known that under Eq.\\ref{eq:ADH_proposal} a region $A^c$ is approximately correctable\\cite{Schumacher2007}.

Namely, there exists an operator on $A$ such that Eq.\\ref{eq:reconstruction} holds, up to a correction of $O(n\\epsilon + \\delta^{\\frac{1}{2}})$.\n\nIt is interesting to study the various limits in which this correction term becomes small.

Since the twist operator is primary, the result should only depend on the cross ratio between the four regions depicted in Fig.\\ref{fig:Example}. Specifically, setting the lengths of the two intervals of $A$ as $x_1,x_2$ and the lengths of the two intervals as $x_3,x_4$, the mutual information should be a function of $x=\\frac{x_1x_2}{x_3x_4}$. Its dependence on $x$ should scale as $x^{\\Delta}$, and as such, in $\\Delta \\to \\infty$ limit it is reasonable to expect it to vanish for $0<x<1.$ A missing part of the argument concerns the behavior of the OPE coefficient in this limit. As long as it grows subexponentially with $\\Delta$, our claim should remain intact. Intriguingly, extremal CFTs with  large central charge by definition should have this property\\cite{Witten2007}. Our work does not seem to shed any new light on the existence of such CFTs. However, it does strongly suggest that such a theory, if it is dual to the pure quantum gravity theory in (2+1)D AdS as conjectured in Ref.\\cite{Witten2007}, should admit entanglement wedge reconstruction.\n\nUnfortunately, this line of  reasoning is more limited to the well-studied instances of the AdS/CFT with extra compactified dimension. The mutual information will always contain a term of the form of $\\frac{1}{r^{\\Delta}}$, and the existence of the Kaluza-Klein excitations necessarily puts a nontrivial upper bound on $\\Delta$ according to the standard dictionary\\cite{Gubser1998,Witten1998}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe ADH proposal, whilst being a general framework that is independent of the details of the AdS/CFT correspondence, already puts a strong constraint on the precursor problem. The reason is that the states appearing in this context have a special universal structure that is inherited from the RT formula. Indeed, we were able to say something nontrivial about bulk operators that lie beyond the causal wedge by incorporating this fact.\n\nModulo our assumptions, our work constitute as a partial proof of the entanglement wedge conjecture. Of course, this is not without any deficiencies. Most importantly, the argument is based on the ADH proposal, and we did not justify this proposal from more fundamental principles. Also, our argument cannot be applied to operators that are located close to the causal/entangling surface, as such operators cannot be reconstructed from the boundary region in a standard quantum error correcting sense\\cite{Almheiri2014}. It is also worth noting that causal wedge and entanglement wedge differ from each other in general in asymptotically AdS space\\cite{Hubeny2012}, even for spherical boundary regions. A different line of reasoning seems necessary in order to study these cases.\n\nIn the language of quantum error correcting code, our analysis can be interpreted as enlarging a correctable region of the code from the assumptions about the codewords. The assumption used here is the RT formula, but an insight in a similar vein has been already commonly used in deriving fundamental tradeoff bounds for quantum error correcting codes.\\cite{Bravyi2009} It turns out that reformulating the problem this way and generalizing these insights leads to more fundamental constraints, as it shall be demonstrated elsewhere.\n\n\n\nWe note that the work of Dong, Harlow, and Wall\\cite{Dong2016} also makes significant progress on the causal wedge/entanglement wedge question. There are two key differences between their proposal and this one, however.\n\nThe first difference is the degree to which Ref.\\cite{Jafferis2015} is used in the two constructions; while it is central to the DHW construction, our construction does not make direct use of it. This is perhaps related to the fact that their analysis applies to the entirety of asymptotically AdS spacetimes, while ours hold more specifically to small deformations around vacuum AdS.\n\nThe second difference is that their construction requires that for two states in the bulk localized in the complement of the entanglement wedge are indistinguishable from each other, with relative entropy 0.
