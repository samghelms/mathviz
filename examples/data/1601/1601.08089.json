If the core has non-zero\nangular momentum, then a fraction of its mass lands onto a circumstellar disk\nformed owing to conservation of the net angular momentum of the core.\nIn this scenario, stars and disks accrete material from isolated \nparental cores until the latter are depleted or dispersed via feedback from stellar \nirradiation and outflows.\n\nHowever, there is growing evidence that forming young stellar objects \nmay be constantly or periodically replenished from the external environment.\nA sizeable fraction of cores appear to form not in isolation, but within dense \nand rich large-scale structures. For instance, recent Herschel and IRAM images show that dense \ncores often lie along sinuous filaments, like beads in a string \\citep{Andre2014,Tafalla2015},\nimplying an interesting possibility for prolonged accretion from these \nfilamentary structures. \n\nThis assumption seems to be  supported by recent\nanalytical, numerical, and observational studies. For instance, the usually referred\nmean age of 2-3~Myr for circumstellar disks \\citep{Mamajek2009} might in fact be \nconsiderably underestimated due to selection criteria that focus onto the densest parts of stellar\nclusters (most prone to disk erosion) and leave out field stars \\citep{Pfalzner2014}. \nThere is also a wide spread in the disk lifetimes: some objects lose their disks\nvery early ($\\le 1.0$ Myr), whereas other objects retain their  disks for up to 10 Myr\nand even longer \\citep{Beccari2010,WC2011,DeMarchi2013}. \nAn implication for these findings is that the disk dispersal mechanisms, \nsuch as UV/X-ray photoevaporation, may act longer than was previously thought \nor circumstellar disks may be replenished from the external environment.\nNumerical hydrodynamics simulations of clustered star formation support the\nnotion of prolonged accretion, showing that protostellar cores can\nbe repeatedly replenished in response to the fluctuating conditions in the \nsurrounding environment \\citep{Bonnell2014,Padoan2014}.\n\n\n\nMotivated by these findings, we presented recently a numerical hydrodynamics\nstudy of collapsing cores embedded in an external environment with different\nmagnitude and direction of rotation \\citep{VLG2015}. Our major conclusion was that \nthe evolution of stars and circumstellar disks in isolated and non-isolated systems \nmay be drastically different. The most curious case was found for \nthe model with opposite spin directions of the core and external environment. This\npeculiar system demonstrated the formation of counter-rotating disks separated by a \ndeep gap in the gas surface density, resembling somewhat in morphology the AB Aurigae\nsystem also seemingly showing the signs of prolonged accretion and counter-rotating disk\nstructures \\citep{Tang2012}.\n\nThe formation scenario for counter-rotating disks requires a source of material, which\n{\\it i}) has a spin direction that is opposite (in general) to that of the disk and {\\it ii})\ncan accrete onto disk sometime after its formation. \nThe star-forming turbulent and chaotic environment may naturally provide such an environment.\nIndeed, numerical simulations of clustered star formation demonstrate that \nprotostellar cores can be regularly replenished in response to the fluctuating conditions \nin the local environment \\citep{Bonnell2014} and the angular momentum vector of the\naccreted material can undergo significant changes both in magnitude\nand direction with respect to the star \\citep{Bate2010, Fielding2015},\noften leading to the formation of misaligned star-disk \nsystems exceeding in some cases 90$^{\\circ}$. The recent observations\nof wide-separation ($>1000$~AU) binary/multiple systems in the Perseus\nstar-forming region revealed that the distribution of the outflow directions\nis consistent with preferentially random or even anti-aligned distributions,\nimplying that these systems possibly\nformed in environments where the distribution of angular momentum is complex and disordered,\nrather than co-rotating or aligned \\citep{Lee2016}.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\center\n\\caption{Model parameters}\n\\label{table1}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccccccccc}\n\\hline\\hline\nModel & $M_{\\rm core}$ & $\\beta_{\\rm core}$ & $M_{\\rm ext}$ &  $\\beta_{\\rm ext}$ & $\\Omega_{\\rm core}$  &  $r_{\\rm 0}$ & $\\Sigma_0$  & $R_{\\rm core}$  \\\\\n & $M_\\odot$ & $\\%$ & $M_\\odot$ & $\\%$ & km~s$^{-1}$~pc$^{-1}$ &  AU & g~cm$^{-2}$ & pc \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 1.0 & 0.7 & 0.65 & 1.36 & 0.56  & 3430 & $3.6\\times 10^{-2}$ & 0.07 \\\\\n2 & 1.0 & 0.7 & 0.33 & 1.36 & 0.61 & 2915 & $4.3\\times 10^{-2}$ & 0.068 \\\\\n3 & 1.0 & 0.7 & 0.65 & 0.7 & 0.56 &  3430 & $3.6\\times 10^{-2}$ & 0.07 \\\\\n\n\n\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\par\n\\vspace{5 pt}\n{$M_{\\rm core}$ and $M_{\\rm ext}$ are the initial masses of the pre-stellar core and the external environment, $\\beta_{\\rm core}$ and $\\beta_{\\rm ext}$ the ratios of rotational\nto gravitational energy in the core and external environment, $\\Omega_{\\rm core}$ the angular velocity\nof the core, $r_0$ and $\\Sigma_0$ the size of the central plateau and the central surface density of\nthe core, and $R_{\\rm core}$ the radius of the core.  }\n\\end{table*}\n\n\nMoreover, the recent numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the core collapse and disk \nformation, taking into account the Hall \neffect,  suggest that the outer envelope can change its rotation direction to the opposite \nwith respect to the disk if the rotation vector of the parental core and the magnetic field\nare antiparallel \\citep{Tsukamoto2015}. If the outer envelope remains gravitationally bound to \nthe system, its subsequent infall onto the disk can serve as a source of external counter-rotating \nmaterial.\n\nIn this paper, we perform an indepth analysis  of counter-rotating disks formed as a result\nof gravitational collapse of rotating cores embedded in an external environment with the\nopposite direction of rotation. We compare the properties of gaps in counter-rotating \ndisks with those typically found in planet-bearing disks.

Numerical hydrodynamics simulations start from a collapsing pre-stellar core embedded into\nan external low-density environment. Because the density of the core is much higher than that\nof the external environment, the free-fall time of the core is short and the dynamics is \ninitially dominated by contraction of the core and formation of the star plus disk system from the core\nmaterial.  \n\nOnce the mass reservoir in the core has depleted, the material from the external\nenvironment starts falling onto the star plus disk system and the subsequent evolution \nis determined by the mass and angular momentum in the external environment. In this paper,\nwe consider a special case of external environment counter-rotating with respect \nto the spin of the pre-stellar core.\n\nThe main physical processes taken into account when modeling the formation and evolution of counter-rotating\ndisks include viscous and shock heating, irradiation by the forming star, \nbackground irradiation (10~K), radiative cooling from the disk surface and disk self-gravity. \nIn particular, the stellar irradiation is taken into account by calculating the amount\nof stellar flux intercepted by the disk/envelope. To do this, the incidence angle of \nstellar radiation is calculated from the shape of the disk surface using \nthe local vertical scale height and \nthe assumption of vertical hydrostatic balance. The possible self-shading\nof the disk/envelope is not taken into account. The viscosity is calculated using the \n$\\alpha$-parameterization of \\citet{SS1973}, with the $\\alpha$-value varying between \n$10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$. With these assumptions, the viscous and irradiation heating scale\nas $r^{-3}$ and $r^{-1.75}$, respectively, so that the former usually \ndominates in the inner several tens of AU (if $\\alpha$ is not too low), but the latter \nalways dominates in the outer disk\\footnote{ The irradiation flux is determined as \n$F_{\\rm irr}=\\cos \\gamma_{\\rm irr} L_\\ast / (4 \\pi r^2)$, where $L_\\ast$ is the \nstellar luminosity and the cosine of the incidence angle is proportional to \n$H/r$, where $H$ is the vertical scale height. We assumed here that $H/r\\propto r^{0.25}$,\nbut the slope in our models may vary somewhat around this value.}. \n\nThe pertinent equations of mass, momentum, and\nenergy transport, and the solution procedure, are described in \\citet{VLG2015}.\nThe forming star is described by the Lyon stellar evolution code \\citep{Baraffe2012},  \nwhile the formation and long-term evolution of the circumstellar disk \nare described using numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit. \nTo avoid too small time steps, we introduce a ``sink cell'' at $r_{\\rm sc}=6.0$~AU and \nimpose a free outflow  boundary condition so that that the matter is allowed to flow out of \nthe computational domain but is prevented from flowing in. \n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=13cm]{figure2.eps}\n\n  \\caption{Gas surface density in the inner $2000\\times 2000$~AU$^{2}$ box in model~1.

In this study, we consider the opposite initial configuration in which\nthe mass contained in the core is higher than that in the external environment.\nWe note that both the core and external environment are initially out of virial \nequilibrium ($|E_{\\rm grav}| > 2 E_{\\rm th} + E_{\\rm rot}$) and both undergo\ngravitational contraction after the start of the numerical simulations.  \n\n\n\\section{Formation of counter-rotating disks}\n\\label{disks}\nThe formation of counter-rotating disks is demonstrated in Figure~\\ref{fig2} showing \nthe time evolution of the gas surface density in model~1. We zoom in onto the inner $2000\\times 2000$~AU$^2$\nbox where the most interesting effects take place, but note that the total computational domain \nhas a size of $20000\\times20000$~AU$^2$. The time elapsed since the formation of the central \nprotostar is shown in each panel. \n\nThe initial configuration is gravitationally unstable and collapses to form \na central protostar. However, because the gas density is higher in the core than in \nthe external environment, the former collapses faster than the latter.\nAfter several thousands years, a centrifugally balanced disk forms \nand grows in size and mass thanks to the continuing inflow of matter from the collapsing core. \nIn this early phase, the disk corotates with the core. \nHowever, at $t\\approx0.14$~Myr the disk growth \nhalts when the mass reservoir in the collapsing core exhausts and the material from \nthe collapsing counter-rotating external environment starts falling\nonto the disk outer regions.  \nThis infalling material mixes with the disk,\nreducing its net angular momentum and causing the disk to shrink by a factor of several by \n$t=0.2$~Myr. We note that the infall of external material is not modelled by adding material \nat certain radii with a given mass and angular momentum rate,\nbut rather through self-consistent numerical hydrodynamics simulations covering\non the same numerical mesh both the disk and the external environment \ncontracting gravitationally towards the disk. \n\nTo better illustrate the effect of infall from the external environment, we show in Figure~\\ref{fig3} the angular velocity\nby absolute value $|\\Omega|$ (upper panel) and the gas surface density $\\Sigma$ (lower panel) \nas a function of radial distance from the star. Both $|\\Omega|$ and $\\Sigma$ are azimuthally \naveraged. Four time instances are denoted by lines of different color as shown in the legend. \nIn the upper panel, the solid/dashed lines represent positive/negative values of $\\Omega$.\nThe inner regions rotate  counter-clockwise (positive $\\Omega$), while the outer\nregions rotate clockwise (negative $\\Omega$). A sharp drop in $|\\Omega|$ manifests a radial \nposition \nwhere the counter-rotating external environment mixes with the inner core/disk, resulting in a\nnet decrease in $|\\Omega|$.  \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n\n  \\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{figure4.eps}}\n  \\caption{Gas velocity field superimposed on the gas surface density map \n  in model~1 at $t=0.24$~Myr. Two counter-rotating disks are clearly visible.}\n  \\label{fig4}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nThe upper panel in Figure~\\ref{fig3} demonstrates that the interface between \nthe external environment (dashed lines)\nand the inner material constituting the core and the disk (solid lines) moves radially \ninward with time. At $t\\le0.14$~Myr,\nthe position of the interface is still far away from the disk outer edge, the latter \nis schematically indicated in the lower panel by the filled circles. \nAs a result, the disk grows in size during the early evolution thanks to\ncontinuing accretion of corotating material from the collapsing core. However, once \nthe core has almost completely accreted onto the disk plus star system, the \nmaterial from the counter-rotating external environment starts landing onto and \nmixing with the disk. The  \nlatter shrinks in size as indicated by the arrow in the lower panel. \nDuring $t=0.19-0.20$~Myr, the size of the disk is determined by the current position \nof the interface between the disk and the infalling external material.\n\nThe subsequent evolution of the system ($t\\ge0.21$~Myr) reveals an interesting effect: the \nformation of two counter-rotating disks separated by a deep gap. This phenomenon, first noted\nin \\citet{VLG2015}, is \nillustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig4} showing the gas velocity field (yellow arrows) superimposed\non the gas surface density map at $t=0.24$~Myr.  The inner disk rotates counter-clockwise, in the \nsame direction as the initial rotation of the parental core, while the outer disk rotates clockwise, in \nthe same direction as the external environment. As time passes, the outer disk gradually grows in \nsize owing to infall of the external material, while the inner disk shrinks owing to accretion \nonto the star. \n\nThe formation of the outer counter-rotating disk can be understood if we consider \nthe centrifugal radius of matter initially located at a distance $r$ from the star\\footnote{\nWe note that this equation is strictly valid for a point-mass object. However, \nour initial surface density distribution is similar to that of Mestel's disk, \n$\\Sigma \\propto r^{-1}$, the gravitational potential of which is similar to that of the point-mass object\nwith the point mass substituted by the mass \nlocated within a given radius $r$ \\citep{Binney}.

The evolution in model~2 follows a path similar to that of model~1: the initial growth of \nthe disk is followed by its contraction and formation of a counter-rotating outer disk.

The parameters of every model are provided in Table~\\ref{table1}.\nAll three models have similar integrated properties of the core, albeit with some variations in the\nradial density profiles\\footnote{We note that the evolution of the core depends weakly \non the gas surface\ndensity and angular velocity profiles, but is quite sensitive to the integrated quantities such as its\nmass \\citep{Vorobyov2012}}, but differ significantly in the characteristics \nof the external environment. In particular, they have different masses  $M_{\\rm ext}$ and \ndifferent ratios of rotational to gravitational energy $\\beta_{\\rm ext}$ in the external \nenvironment, while the corresponding quantities in the core \n($M_{\\rm core}$ and $\\beta_{\\rm core}$) are the same.\nIn our previous study \\citep{VLG2015}, the mass of the core was lower than that contained in \nthe external environment. In this study, we consider the opposite initial configuration in which\nthe mass contained in the core is higher than that in the external environment.\nWe note that both the core and external environment are initially out of virial \nequilibrium ($|E_{\\rm grav}| > 2 E_{\\rm th} + E_{\\rm rot}$) and both undergo\ngravitational contraction after the start of the numerical simulations.  \n\n\n\\section{Formation of counter-rotating disks}\n\\label{disks}\nThe formation of counter-rotating disks is demonstrated in Figure~\\ref{fig2} showing \nthe time evolution of the gas surface density in model~1. We zoom in onto the inner $2000\\times 2000$~AU$^2$\nbox where the most interesting effects take place, but note that the total computational domain \nhas a size of $20000\\times20000$~AU$^2$. The time elapsed since the formation of the central \nprotostar is shown in each panel. \n\nThe initial configuration is gravitationally unstable and collapses to form \na central protostar. However, because the gas density is higher in the core than in \nthe external environment, the former collapses faster than the latter.\nAfter several thousands years, a centrifugally balanced disk forms \nand grows in size and mass thanks to the continuing inflow of matter from the collapsing core. \nIn this early phase, the disk corotates with the core. \nHowever, at $t\\approx0.14$~Myr the disk growth \nhalts when the mass reservoir in the collapsing core exhausts and the material from \nthe collapsing counter-rotating external environment starts falling\nonto the disk outer regions.  \nThis infalling material mixes with the disk,\nreducing its net angular momentum and causing the disk to shrink by a factor of several by \n$t=0.2$~Myr. We note that the infall of external material is not modelled by adding material \nat certain radii with a given mass and angular momentum rate,\nbut rather through self-consistent numerical hydrodynamics simulations covering\non the same numerical mesh both the disk and the external environment \ncontracting gravitationally towards the disk. \n\nTo better illustrate the effect of infall from the external environment, we show in Figure~\\ref{fig3} the angular velocity\nby absolute value $|\\Omega|$ (upper panel) and the gas surface density $\\Sigma$ (lower panel) \nas a function of radial distance from the star. Both $|\\Omega|$ and $\\Sigma$ are azimuthally \naveraged. Four time instances are denoted by lines of different color as shown in the legend. \nIn the upper panel, the solid/dashed lines represent positive/negative values of $\\Omega$.\nThe inner regions rotate  counter-clockwise (positive $\\Omega$), while the outer\nregions rotate clockwise (negative $\\Omega$). A sharp drop in $|\\Omega|$ manifests a radial \nposition \nwhere the counter-rotating external environment mixes with the inner core/disk, resulting in a\nnet decrease in $|\\Omega|$.  \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n\n  \\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{figure4.eps}}\n  \\caption{Gas velocity field superimposed on the gas surface density map \n  in model~1 at $t=0.24$~Myr. Two counter-rotating disks are clearly visible.}\n  \\label{fig4}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nThe upper panel in Figure~\\ref{fig3} demonstrates that the interface between \nthe external environment (dashed lines)\nand the inner material constituting the core and the disk (solid lines) moves radially \ninward with time. At $t\\le0.14$~Myr,\nthe position of the interface is still far away from the disk outer edge, the latter \nis schematically indicated in the lower panel by the filled circles. \nAs a result, the disk grows in size during the early evolution thanks to\ncontinuing accretion of corotating material from the collapsing core. However, once \nthe core has almost completely accreted onto the disk plus star system, the \nmaterial from the counter-rotating external environment starts landing onto and \nmixing with the disk. The  \nlatter shrinks in size as indicated by the arrow in the lower panel. \nDuring $t=0.19-0.20$~Myr, the size of the disk is determined by the current position \nof the interface between the disk and the infalling external material.\n\nThe subsequent evolution of the system ($t\\ge0.21$~Myr) reveals an interesting effect: the \nformation of two counter-rotating disks separated by a deep gap. This phenomenon, first noted\nin \\citet{VLG2015}, is \nillustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig4} showing the gas velocity field (yellow arrows) superimposed\non the gas surface density map at $t=0.24$~Myr.  The inner disk rotates counter-clockwise, in the \nsame direction as the initial rotation of the parental core, while the outer disk rotates clockwise, in \nthe same direction as the external environment. As time passes, the outer disk gradually grows in \nsize owing to infall of the external material, while the inner disk shrinks owing to accretion \nonto the star. \n\nThe formation of the outer counter-rotating disk can be understood if we consider \nthe centrifugal radius of matter initially located at a distance $r$ from the star\\footnote{\nWe note that this equation is strictly valid for a point-mass object. However, \nour initial surface density distribution is similar to that of Mestel's disk, \n$\\Sigma \\propto r^{-1}$, the gravitational potential of which is similar to that of the point-mass object\nwith the point mass substituted by the mass \nlocated within a given radius $r$ \\citep{Binney}.

We think that high \neccentricity of the gap and its edges is caused by the gravitational perturbation from the \nstrongly asymmetric structure of  the inner disk. Indeed, the early evolution of the inner disk is characterized\nby the presence of extended asymmetric spiral arcs. There is also a massive fragment \n($\\approx25-30~M_{\\rm Jup}$) outlined by the yellow circle \nin the bottom-right corner of Figure~\\ref{fig6} at $t=0.23$~Myr, which is likely ejected \nfrom the disk via multi-body interaction with other fragments. \nThese strong azimuthal distortions may cause\nstrong perturbations to the infalling external material, which results in the development of the \neccentric gap and outer disk. We note that the inner disks in model~1 and model~3 (see below) \nalso exhibit a spiral structure and fragmentation before the formation of the outer disk, \nbut nevertheless we do not see strong eccentricity developing in the outer disk during the evolution. It might be due to the fact that models~1 and 3 have a factor of 2 greater mass reservoir \nin the external environment and, as a consequence more massive outer disks, which are less prone to\nthe eccentricity excitation than that of model~2.\nIn any case, it appears that the outcome depends significantly on the available mass in the external\nenvironment, on particular\ninner disk configuration including the presence or absence of extended spiral arcs and ejected fragments,\nand therefore cannot be predicted a priori.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig6} indicates that the eccentricity of the disk and the gap in model~2\nseems to diminish with time. This is likely due to the absence of continuing gravitational perturbation\ncaused by smooth density distribution of the inner disk. Indeed, the distribution \nof gas in the inner disk\n(after the formation of the outer disk) becomes nearly axisymmetric, likely due to disk contraction\nand associated heating, thus reducing the source of gravitational\nperturbation. As a result, the disk eccentricity is gradually damped by the viscous evolution.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=13cm]{figure8.eps}\n\n  \\caption{Similar to Figure~\\ref{fig2} only for model~3.}\n  \\label{fig8}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFinally, in Figure~\\ref{fig8} we show the formation of counter-rotating disks in model~3. \nThis model is characterized by a factor of 2 smaller value of $\\beta$ in the external environment\nthan in model~1. Nevertheless, the overall evolution is similar to model~1, except that the gap\nappears to be somewhat narrower. We conclude that the gap can form for a wide range of physical \nparameters (masses, angular momenta) in the external environment.\nAnother interesting phenomenon that can be seen in Figure~\\ref{fig8} is gravitational\nfragmentation in the outer counter-rotating disk at $t=0.3-0.4$~Myr. A similar effect was also reported\nin \\citet{VLG2015}. Although the fragment does not survive for long (which might be caused by insufficient\nnumerical resolution), this phenomenon present an interesting gateway for the formation of giant planets\ncounter-rotating with respect to the host star.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\centering\n  \\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{figure9.eps}}\n  \\caption{Azimuthally averaged profiles of the gas surface density in models 1, 2, and 3 (from top\n  to bottom).

Figure~\\ref{fig9}\npresents the azimuthally averaged profiles of the gas surface density in three models. Only the late\nevolution times are considered. A deep gap in the gas surface density\nis evident between the inner and outer disks. In order to estimate the depth of the gap, \nwe plot a tangent line connecting the radial density profiles in the inner and outer disks \nshown with the dotted lines. The depletion of the gap is then calculated as the ratio between \nthe gas surface density given by the model and that given by the tangent, \nboth calculated at the position of the gap's deepest point.\nThe arrow illustrates the gap depletion for model~1 at $t=0.4$~Myr. \nTable~\\ref{table2} provides the time-averaged properties of the gaps.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\center\n\\caption{Properties of the gaps}\n\\label{table2}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline\\hline\nModel & $R_{\\rm gap}$ (AU) & $\\triangle \\Sigma_{\\rm gap} (\\%)$ & $u_{\\rm gap}$ (AU~Myr$^{-1}$)  \\\\\n\n\\hline\n1 & 72 & 0.14 & 83 \\\\\n2 & 115 & 0.39  & $<1.0$  \\\\\n3 & 50 & 0.18 & 150  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\\par\n\\vspace{5 pt}\n{ ${R}_{\\rm gap}$ is the\nmean position of the gap, $\\triangle \\Sigma_{\\rm gap}$ the gap depletion in per cent, \nand $u_{\\rm gap }$ the mean propagating velocity. }\n\n\\end{table}\n\nEvidently, the gaps are characterized by a wide range of radial positions, which \nmay vary from a few tens of AU to more than a hundred AU. In particular, model~2 is\ncharacterized by the gap position that is roughly a factor of two further out than\nin the other two models. This is related to the fact that model~2 has the\nsmallest external mass reservoir. The depletion factor $\\triangle \\Sigma_{\\rm\ngap}$ in all models is rather strong, indicating a drop in the gas surface density\nby at least two orders of magnitude at the position of the gap. \nThe strongest contrast \nbetween the models is found for the gap propagation velocity, which may vary from rather fast \npropagation in model~3 (AU~Myr$^{-1}$) to very slow inward motion in model~2 ($<1$~AU~Myr$^{-1}$). \nModel~3 is characterized by the smallest angular momentum in the external environment ($\\beta$=0.7).\nIn our previous work \\citep{VLG2015}, we showed that infall of external material with low angular\nmomentum exerts a strong negative torque onto the inner disk, which can lead to significant \ncontraction or even complete dissipation of the latter. A similar effect takes place in model~3,\npromoting the contraction of the inner disk and increasing the gap propagation speed.\nInterestingly, model~2 with the slowest gap propagation velocity is also characterized\nby the greatest asymmetry in both the gap and the outer disk shape. \nThis implies a causal link between the shape of the gap and its propagation velocity.\n\n\nIn \\citet{VLG2015} it was claimed that the gaps formed in counter-rotating disks are short-lived (several\ntens of kyr), transient phenomena. This conclusion was based on the behaviour of the gap in \none model only. Our numerical simulations with a wider parameter space show that the gaps may \nbe a long-lived phenomenon, lasting for at least several hundred of kyr and perhaps even longer.\n\nFinally, we note that the slopes of the tangents in Figure~\\ref{fig9} lie in the $\\alpha_{\\rm\nd}=-[1.6:1.8]$\nrange, which is only slightly steeper than expected for young self-gravitating disks, \n$\\alpha_{\\rm d}=-1.5$ \\citep{Vor2010,Rice2010}, and\nsignificantly steeper than expected for more evolved, viscosity-dominated protoplanetary \ndisks with the kinematic viscosity proportional to the disk radius, $\\alpha_{\\rm d}=-1.0$ \n\\citep{LBP1974,WC2011}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Comparison with planet-bearing gaps}\n\\label{planets}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{figure10a}\n\\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{figure10b}\n\\caption{Comparison of gap formation in counter-rotating disks and a giant plant bearing protoplanetary \ndisk assuming $5\\,M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ (upper row) and $2.5\\,M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ (lower row) planetary mass, respectively. \n\\emph{Left panel:} density distribution in the counter-rotating disk models at 0.6\\,Myr. \\emph{Middle panel}: \ndensity distribution in giant planet bearing disk model after 1000 orbits of the giant planet. \\emph{Right panel:} \ncomparison of azimuthally averaged density profiles for both models.

A massive planet clears the disk around it to form\na gap through gravitational interaction if its Hill radius is greater than the local disk scale height\nand the time scale for the gap opening is shorter than the time scale for viscous diffusion to close\nit \\citep{KN2012}. To model the gap opening via planet-disk interaction, we employ \nthe two-dimensional numerical \nhydrodynamics simulations using the FARGO-ADSG code and also its GPU based version (Masset 2000). \nThe FARGO code solves the vertically integrated continuity and Navier--Stokes equations \nnumerically in the cylindrical coordinate system, using the locally isothermal approximation.\n\nIn the local isothermal approximation, the radial temperature profile is $T(r) \\sim r^{-1}$, and \nthe equation of state of the gas is ${\\cal P}(r,\\phi)=c_\\mathrm{s}(r)^2\\Sigma(r,\\phi)$ depends \nonly on the density and the local sound speed $c_\\mathrm{s}(r)=\\Omega(r)H(r)$, where $H(r)$ \nis the local pressure scale \nheight. Note that both $c_\\mathrm{s}(r)$ and $H(r)$ are constant in time due to the assumption\nof local isothermality. The disk scale height is proportional to radius, $H(r)=A r$, where \n$A$ is the disk aspect ratio, which is set to $A=0.05$ for all models. \n\nThe 2D computational domain extends from 6~AU to 1000~AU, consisting of $N_R=256$ logarithmically \ndistributed radial, and $N_\\phi=512$ equidistant azimuthal grid cells. For the smoothing length\nof the planet gravitational potential we choose $\\epsilon H(R_\\mathrm{p})$, where\n$R_{\\rm p}$ is the position of the planet and $\\epsilon=0.6$, the latter being appropriate for \n2D simulations \\citep{Kley2012}. The gas is allowed to flow out from the \ncomputational domain, i.e. an open boundary condition is applied at both the inner \nand outer domain boundaries. The disk viscosity is approximated by the $\\alpha$-prescription of \n\\citet{SS1973}. The magnitude of viscosity is varied in the range of \n$10^{-3}\\leq\\alpha\\leq10^{-2}$. For comparison, in the counter-rotating disk simulations, \nthe viscous $\\alpha$ was set to a constant value of $5\\times 10^{-3}$.\nWe use a coordinate frame that co-rotates with the planet.\n\nThe initial density profile of the gas disk is $\\Sigma(R,\\phi)=\\Sigma_0 R^{-1.5}$, where \n$\\Sigma_0$ is chosen so as to set the disk mass to $\\sim0.03~M_\\odot$ inside the computational \ndomain. For this disk mass, the  Toomre $Q$-parameter \\citep{Toomre1964} is greater than three \nthroughout the disk ($Q\\simeq8.5$ at the planetary distance). These high values of $Q$-parameter \nmake it possible to neglect the disk's \nself-gravity. We also consider models for which the disk mass is increased to $\\sim0.3~M_\\odot$. \nFor those high-disk-mass models, the disk's self-gravity is taken into account.\n\nThe planet is set on an orbit at $80$\\,AU from the central star (to match the position of the\ngap in the counter-rotating disk model) and the planet is not allowed to migrate or accrete \ngas, i.e., it remains on a circular orbit with constant mass. The planet-to-star mass ratio are \n$q=0.9\\times10^{-3}$, $2.35\\times10^{-3}$, and $4.7\\times10^{-3}$ corresponding to \n$1,\\,2.5,\\,$ and $5$ Jupiter mass planets for a $1.0$ Solar mass central star. The planetary \nmass and the disk viscosity were \nvaried in a wide range to produce different configuration of the planet-bearing gaps. \nOur purpose is to determine the characteristic signatures of the gaps in counter-rotating \ndisks which can help to distinguish them from the planet-bearing gaps. \n\nFor a planet-bearing disk model, the density snapshots were taken at the end of the \nsimulation (after 1000 orbits of the giant planet corresponding to 0.07 Myr after the planet \nwas inserted to the disk), when a quasi \nsteady disk state had been achieved. In each row of Figures~\\ref{fig10}-\\ref{fig13}, the first \nand second panels show the gas surface density distribution in the counter-rotating disk \nand planet-bearing disk models. The third panel shows the azimuthally averaged radial density \nprofiles (black for counter-rotating, blue for planet-bearing disk models). \nFor the counter-rotating disk model, we use the data for model~1 at $t=0.6$~Myr.\nThe densities in non-self-gravitating planet-bearing models are scaled such that \nthe density profile at the inner disk ($R<80$\\,AU) fits to that of the counter-rotating \ndisk model. We note that as long as the disk self-gravity and the planetary migration are \nnot taken into account, the density can be scaled as $\\Sigma_0$ can \nbe cancelled out from the continuity and Navier--Stokes equations.\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{fig10} shows the comparison of gaps in counter-rotating and planet-bearing \ndisk models for the viscous $\\alpha=5\\times10^{-3}$ and the planet mass of $M_{\\rm p}=5$ \n(upper row) and $M_{\\rm p}=2.5$ (lower \nrow) Jupiters. The surface density in the planet-bearing model is scaled up by a \nfactor of 50 in order to match \nthe peak density in the inner disk of the counter-rotating disk model\\footnote{We scale \n$\\Sigma$ with a sole purpose of facilitating the comparison between the radial density profiles\nin different models. This scaling procedure is not meant for comparing the absolute values \nof the gas surface density, but only their ratios, such as the gap depletion factor.}. \nWe found that the lower \n$M_{\\rm p}=2.5$~$M_{\\rm Jup}$ model seems to match slightly better the azimuthally averaged \ndensity profiles in the inner \ndisk, including the density contrast between the inner disk edge and the center of the gap, \nwhereas both planet-bearing models are characterized by a smaller contrast between the peak\ndensities in the inner and outer disks. \nAs a consequence, the depletion in planet-bearing gaps is significantly stronger\nthan in the case of counter-rotating disks, 0.02\\% \nfor $5\\,M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ and 0.08\\% for $2.5\\,M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ planet as compared to\n0.14\\% in model~1.\n\nFigure\\,\\ref{fig11} shows the effect of viscosity on the gas density distribution in \nplanet-bearing disk models with different values of $\\alpha=10^{-2}$ (upper row) and $\\alpha=10^{-3}$ (lower row). \nThe planet mass in both cases is set to $M_{\\rm p}=2.5$~$M_{\\rm Jup}$. \nFor both models, we applied a density scaling factor of 130 and 20 to match the\ninner density profile of the counter-rotating disk model. The model with a higher \n$\\alpha=10^{-2}$ demonstrates a significantly shallower gap (the depletion factor is 0.37\\%) \nthan its low-$\\alpha$ counterpart (0.002\\%) thanks to an increased viscous transport. \nAs a consequence, the gap depth in the $\\alpha=10^{-2}$ model fits better\nto that of the counter-rotating disk model. \n\n\nTo better match the density depletion inside the gap, the planetary mass was further decreased \nto $1.0~M_\\mathrm{Jup}$. The corresponding density distribution is shown in Figure\\,\\ref{fig12}. \nFor this case, the proper density scaling for the planet-bearing model was found to be 20. \nWith $1.0~M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ for the planetary mass and $10^{-3}$ for the viscous $\\alpha$, \nthe inner disk density profile, including the depletion factor in the gap \n(0.24\\%), are found to match those of the counter-rotating disk model~1 better than in \npreviously considered planet-bearing models. \nNevertheless, the gap in the planet-bearing disk model still has sharper edges than those\nof the counter-rotating disk model.\n\nIt appears that for the case of giant planet-bearing, non-self-gravitating disks the gaps tend \nto be deeper than those of the counter-rotating disks unless the viscosity is high \n($\\alpha=10^{-2}$) or the planetary mass is low ($\\sim1\\,M_\\mathrm{Jup}$). The density peak at \nthe gap outer edge in the planet-bearing model is always higher, implying that a pressure maximum \nis much better expressed in planet-bearing disks than in counter-rotating disks.\nIn addition, the slope of the planet-bearing disk is usually shallower, than that of the\ncounter-rotating disk. For instance, the planet-bearing disks in Figure~\\ref{fig10} and in\nthe top panel of Figure~\\ref{fig11} have slopes that lies in \nthe $\\alpha_{\\rm d}=-[0.9:1.15]$ limits. The planet-bearing disks in the bottom panel of Figure~\\ref{fig11}\nand in Figure~\\ref{fig12} have somewhat steeper slopes, $\\alpha_{\\rm d}\\approx -1.5$, but still\nshallower than those of the counter-rotating disks, $\\alpha_{\\rm d}=-[1.6:1.8]$. Taking a steeper\ninitial gas surface density distribution in the planet-bearing disk could \nhelp to bring the resulting slope in a better agreement with the counter-rotating disk,\nbut we note that we have already taken a rather steep initial surface density profile,\n$\\Sigma~r^{-1.5}$, and increasing it even further may be difficult to justify.\n\n\n\nIn order to check the effect of disk self-gravity, additional simulations were done using 10 \ntimes higher disk mass (similar to that of the counter-rotating model~1) than previously \nconsidered. We note that in simulations with disk self-gravity the density scaling was \nnot applied. For the viscous $\\alpha$ \nand planetary mass, we chose $10^{-3}$ and $1.0~M_\\mathrm{Jup}$, respectively. As one can see in \nFigure\\,\\ref{fig13}, the density profile of the inner and outer disks match those of the \ncounter-rotating disk model rather well. Significant differences are found only for the innermost \ndisk region, where the surface density of the planet-bearing disk has a notable excess, \nand also at the center of the gap, where the planet-bearing disk has weaker depletion \n($2.5\\%$). We note that the difference in \nthe innermost disk is likely related to different boundary conditions applied in the two numerical codes.\n\n\nWe note that the gap depth and the structure of its edges are expected to be altered if the gas \nthermodynamic is taken into account. Moreover, as the presented snapshots were taken after $1000$\nplanetary orbits, the orbital migration should also be taken into account presumably affecting \nthe shape and the radial position of the gap.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{summary}\nIn this work we studied numerically the formation and physical properties of\ncircumstellar disks formed as a result of gravitational collapse of dense \ncloud cores submerged into a low-density external environment counter-rotating \nwith respect to the core. We found that counter-rotating disks form during the evolution \nfor a wide parameter space of masses and rotation rates in the external environment,  \nwith the inner disk corotating with the star and the outer disk counter-rotating with \nrespect to both the inner disk and the star. \nThe inner and outer disks are separated by a deep gap in the gas surface density.\nThe gap shape, its depth and eccentricity may vary depending on the model. \nThe gap often migrates inward but the migration speeds are vastly different, \nranging from more than a hundred AU per Myr to less than\none AU per Myr, suggesting that this structure may be a \nlong-lived phenomenon which is comparable to the lifetime of the disk itself. \n\nWe compared the properties of the gap in counter-rotating disks with those formed as a result of \ngap opening in a giant-planet-bearing disk. \nWe found that the shape of the inner disk in both gap-opening mechanisms can be rather similar.\nMoreover, given a proper choice\nof the planetary mass and viscous $\\alpha$-parameter (1.0~$M_{\\rm Jup}$ and 10$^{-3}$, respectively) and \nconsidering relatively-massive (self-gravitating) disks, the shape and the depth of the gap\nin planet-bearing models can match those of counter-rotating disks rather well. \nTherefore, the shape of the gas surface density profile in massive planet-bearing disks\nmay resemble that of counter-rotating disks, which will make it difficult to distinguish\nbetween the two gap-forming mechanisms based solely on the gas density distribution.\nThis implies that planet-bearing gaps may be confused with gaps formed in counter-rotating disks\nand gas kinematic studies are necessary to distinguish between the two possible gap-forming mechanisms.\nAnother potentially observable effect that can help to distinguish between the two gaps\nis the emission due to accretion onto the protoplanet. The H$\\alpha$ emission that was recently reported\nfor the LkCa planetary system \\citep{Sallum2015} presents one possible example. The \ndifferences in the shape of the spiral pattern and the pitch angle may also be used to\ndetermine the origin of the gap, but it requires further investigation and synthetic image \nmodeling as was done in, e.g., \\citet{Juhasz2015} and \\citet{Dong2016}. \n\nAt the same time, gaps in counter-rotating disks are as a rule distinct from those formed in \nplanet-bearing models with low-mass (non-self-gravitating) disks.\nThe latter often possess a deeper gap with sharper edges, implying stronger pressure bumps in the \nvicinity of the gap, which are subject to dust accumulation (see e.g., \\citealp{Pinilla2012}). \nNevertheless, we expect that the peculiar density profile in the outer counter-rotating \ndisk can also facilitate the dust growth in these regions, which can lead to an interesting \nperspective of forming a large population of planetesimals and solid protoplanetary cores\ncounter-rotating to the star and the inner disk.\n\n{\\it Acknowledgments.}  We are thankful to the anonymous referee for very useful comments and suggestions\nthat helped to improve the manuscript.
