For more notation and terminology that will be used in the sequel, we refer to \\cite{graphBondy2008}, unless otherwise stated.\n\nIn 2008, Chartrand et al. \\cite{CJMZ} first introduced the concept of rainbow connection. Let $G$ be a nontrivial connected graph on which an edge-coloring $c: E(G)\\rightarrow \\{1,2,\\ldots,k\\}\\\\\n(k\\in \\mathbb{N})$ is defined, where adjacent edges may be colored with the same color. For any two vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$, a path in $G$ connecting $u$ and $v$ is abbreviated as a $uv$-path. A $uv$-path $P$ is a \\emph{rainbow $uv$-path} if no two edges of $P$ are colored with the same color. The graph $G$ is \\emph{rainbow connected} (with respect to $c$) if $G$ contains a rainbow $uv$-path for every two vertices $u$ and $v$, and the coloring $c$ is called a \\emph{rainbow coloring} of $G$. If $k$ colors are used, then $c$ is a \\emph{rainbow $k$-coloring}. The minimum $k$ for which there exists a rainbow $k$-coloring of the edges of $G$ is the \\emph{rainbow connection number} of $G$, denoted by $rc(G)$. The topic of rainbow connection is fairly interesting and numerous relevant papers have been written. For more details see a survey \\cite{LSS} and a book \\cite{LS}.\n\nSubsequently, a series of generalizations of rainbow connection number were proposed. The $k$-rainbow index is one of them. An edge-colored tree $T$ is a \\emph{rainbow tree} if no two edges of $T$ are assigned the same color. Let $G$ be a nontrivial connected graph of order $n$ and let $k$ be an integer with $2\\leq k\\leq n$. A \\emph{$k$-rainbow coloring} of $G$ is an edge coloring of $G$ having the property that for every set $S$ of $k$ vertices of $G$, there exists a rainbow tree $T$ in $G$ such that $S\\subseteq V(T)$. The minimum number of colors needed in a $k$-rainbow coloring of $G$ is the \\emph{$k$-rainbow index} of $G$. These concepts were introduced by Chartrand et al. in \\cite{COZ}, and were further studied in \\cite{CLZ,CLZ2,CLYZ,LSYZ,LSYZ2,LiuH}.\n\nIn addition, a natural extension of the rainbow connection number is the proper connection number, which was introduced by Borozan et al. in \\cite{BFGMMMT}. A path in an edge-colored graph is said to be \\emph{properly edge-colored (or proper)}, if every two adjacent edges differ in color. An edge-colored graph $G$ is \\emph{$k$-proper connected} if any two vertices are connected by $k$ internally pairwise vertex-disjoint proper paths. The \\emph{$k$-proper connection number} of a $k$-connected graph $G$, denoted by $pc_k(G)$, is defined as the smallest number of colors that are needed in order to make $G$ $k$-proper connected. In particular, when $k=1$, the $1$-proper connection number is abbreviated as proper connection number and written as $pc(G)$. For more results, we refer to \\cite{ALLZ,FGM,GLQ,HLW1,HLW2,LLZ,LWY}.\n\nInspired by the $k$-rainbow index and the proper connection number, a natural idea is to introduce the concept of $k$-proper index. A tree $T$ in an edge-colored graph is a \\emph{proper tree} if any two adjacent edges of $T$ are colored with different colors. Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ and $k$ be a fixed integer with $2\\leq k\\leq n$. For a vertex set $S\\subseteq V(G)$, a tree containing the vertices of $S$ in $G$ is called an \\emph{$S$-tree}. An edge-coloring of $G$ is called a \\emph{$k$-proper coloring} if for every set $S$ of $k$ vertices in $G$, there exists a proper $S$-tree in $G$. The \\emph{$k$-proper index} of a nontrivial connected graph $G$, denoted by $px_k(G)$, is the smallest number of colors needed in a $k$-proper coloring of $G$. By definition, $px_2(G)$ is precisely the proper connection number $pc(G)$ for any nontrivial graph $G$. As a variety of nice results about $pc(G)=px_2(G)$ have been obtained, we in this paper only study $px_k(G)$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Section \\ref{Preliminaries}, some simple observations about $px_k(G)$ for a nontrivial graph $G$ are stated. Meanwhile, certain necessary lemmas are also listed. In Section \\ref{Specialgraphs}, the $k$-proper indices of some special graphs are determined. And for every pair of positive integers $a$, $b$ with $2\\leq a\\leq b$, a connected graph $G$ with $px_k(G)=a$ and $rx_k(G)=b$ is constructed for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$. In Section \\ref{Characterize}, the graphs with $k$-proper index $n-1$ and $n-2$ are characterized, respectively.\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\\label{Preliminaries}\nWe in this section state some observations about $px_k(G)$ for a nontrivial graph $G$.

Thus in the following we assume that $G$ is not a cycle. And assume the vertices in the unique cycle of $G$ are $u_1,u_2,\\ldots,u_g$. Besides, keep in mind that $px_k(G)\\leq \\Delta(G)$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$, which will be used later. As before, denote by $b(v)$ the number of bridges incident with the vertex $v$. The discussion is divided into three cases.\n\n{\\bf Case 1.} At first, assume that $G$ contains a vertex, say $u$, satisfying\\\\\n(1) the degree of $u$ is $d(u)=\\Delta(G)$.\\\\\n(2) $u$ is not in the cycle of $G$.\n\nThen evidently the incident edges of $u$ are all bridges, i.e., $b(u)=d(u)=\\Delta(G)$. According to Lemma \\ref{bridge}, we directly have $px_k(G)\\geq b(u)=\\Delta(G)$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Meanwhile, Proposition \\ref{upperbound2} guarantees $px_k(G)\\leq \\Delta(G)$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Accordingly, we get $px_k(G)=\\Delta(G)$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$ in this case.\n\nBy Case 1, if such a vertex $u$ exists in $G$, then we always have $px_k(G)=\\Delta(G)$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$. To avoid redundant presentation, we in the following suppose that $G$ contains no such vertices.\n\n{\\bf Case 2.} Now assume $G$ simultaneously satisfies\\\\\n(3) $G$ contains at most two vertices having maximum degree;\\\\\n(4) the vertices with maximum degree are all in the unique cycle of $G$;\\\\\n(5) these two vertices (if both exist) are adjacent in $G$.\n\nThen without loss of generality, suppose that $d(u_1)=\\Delta(G)$, $d(u_2)\\leq \\Delta(G)$ and $d(u)<\\Delta(G)$ for any other vertex $u$. Moreover, suppose that the neighbors of $u_1$ are $v_1$, $v_2$, $\\ldots$, $v_{\\Delta(G)-2}$, $v_{\\Delta(G)-1}=u_2$ and $v_{\\Delta(G)}=u_g$. Thereupon, in any $3$-proper coloring $c$ of $G$, based on the proof of Lemma \\ref{bridge}, the edges $u_1v_i$ with $i\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$ are assigned with $\\Delta(G)-2$ distinct colors since they are all bridges incident with $u_1$. Without loss of generality, suppose that $c(u_1v_1)=1$, $c(u_1v_2)=2$, $\\ldots$, $c(u_1v_{\\Delta(G)-2})=\\Delta(G)-2$. Further, we claim that at least a new color is used by the edges $u_1u_2$ and $u_1u_g$. For otherwise, suppose that $c(u_1u_2)=i$ and $c(u_1u_g)=j$ with $i,j\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$. If $i=j$, then there exists no proper tree containing the vertices $u_1$, $u_2$ and $v_i$, a contradiction. If $i\\neq j$, then there exists no proper tree containing the vertices $v_i$, $v_j$ and $u_2$, again a contradiction. Therefore, at least $\\Delta(G)-2+1=\\Delta(G)-1$ different colors are used by $c$. It follows that $px_3(G)\\geq \\Delta(G)-1$. Thus, Ineq.$(*)$ deduces that $px_k(G)\\geq px_3(G)\\geq \\Delta(G)-1$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$. On the other hand, obviously $G-u_1u_2$ is a spanning tree of $G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta(G)-1$. By Theorem \\ref{trees}, we know that $px_k(G-u_1u_2)=\\Delta(G-u_1u_2)=\\Delta(G)-1$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Consequently, $px_k(G)\\leq px_k(G-u_1u_2)=\\Delta(G)-1$ based on Proposition \\ref{subgraph}. To sum up, we obtain $px_k(G)=\\Delta(G)-1$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$ in this case.\n\n{\\bf Case 3.} Finally, we discuss the case when $G$ contains at least two vertices $u_i$ and $u_j$ such that\\\\\n(6) $d(u_i)=d(u_j)=\\Delta(G)$;\\\\\n(7) both $u_i$ and $u_j$ are in the cycle of $G$;\\\\\n(8) $u_i$ and $u_j$ are not adjacent in $G$.\n\nThen we claim that $px_3(G)\\geq \\Delta(G)$. Assume to the contrary, $px_3(G)\\leq \\Delta(G)-1$. Let $c'$ be a $3$-proper coloring of $G$ using colors from $\\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-1\\}$. Let the neighbors of $u_i$ be $w_1$, $w_2$, $\\ldots$, $w_{\\Delta(G)-2}$, $w_{\\Delta(G)-1}=u_{i-1}$, $w_{\\Delta(G)}=u_{i+1}$, and the neighbors of $u_j$ be $z_1$, $z_2$, $\\ldots$, $z_{\\Delta(G)-2}$, $z_{\\Delta(G)-1}=u_{j-1}$, $z_{\\Delta(G)}=u_{j+1}$. Similarly to Case 2, the edges $u_iw_t$ with $t\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$ are assigned with $\\Delta(G)-2$ distinct colors. Without loss of generality, suppose that $c'(u_iw_1)=1$, $c'(u_iw_2)=2$, $\\ldots$, $c'(u_iw_{\\Delta(G)-2})=\\Delta(G)-2$. Thus, either $c'(u_iu_{i-1})=c'(u_iu_{i+1})=\\Delta(G)-1$, or there exists at least one edge between $u_iu_{i-1}$ and $u_iu_{i+1}$, say $u_iu_{i-1}$, such that $c'(u_iu_{i-1})=x_1$ with $x_1\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$. Similarly, the edges $u_jz_{t}$ with $t\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$ also receive $\\Delta(G)-2$ distinct colors. And for the edges $u_ju_{j-1}$ and $u_ju_{j+1}$, either $c'(u_ju_{j-1})=c'(u_ju_{j+1})$, or there exists at least one of them, say $u_ju_{j+1}$, such that $c'(u_ju_{j+1})=c'(u_jz_{x_2})$ with $x_2\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$.\\\\\n(i) If $c'(u_iu_{i-1})=c'(u_iu_{i+1})$ and $c'(u_ju_{j-1})=c'(u_ju_{j+1})$, then there exists no proper tree containing the vertices $u_{i-1}$, $u_{i+1}$ and $w_1$, a contradiction.\\\\\n(ii) If $c'(u_iu_{i-1})=c'(u_iu_{i+1})$ and $c'(u_ju_{j+1})=c'(u_jz_{x_2})$ with $x_2\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$, then there exists no proper tree containing the vertices $u_{j+1}$, $u_{j}$ and $z_{x_2}$, a contradiction.\\\\\n(iii) If $c'(u_iu_{i-1})=x_1$ with $x_1\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$ and $c'(u_ju_{j-1})=c'(u_ju_{j+1})$, then there exists no proper tree containing the vertices $u_{i-1}$, $u_{i}$ and $w_{x_1}$, a contradiction.\\\\\n(iv) If $c'(u_iu_{i-1})=x_1$ with $x_1\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$ and $c'(u_ju_{j+1})=c'(u_jz_{x_2})$ with $x_2\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,\\Delta(G)-2\\}$, then there exists no proper tree containing the vertices $w_{x_1}$, $u_{i-1}$ and $z_{x_2}$, a contradiction.\n\nIn summary, we verify that $px_3(G)\\geq \\Delta(G)$, which deduces that $px_k(G)\\geq px_3(G)\\geq \\Delta(G)$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Combine with $px_k(G)\\leq \\Delta(G)$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$, we at last arrive at $px_k(G)=\\Delta(G)$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$ in this case.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is finished. {\\hfill \\nopagebreak\\rule{5pt}{8pt}}\n\nWe conclude this section with a simple theorem to address the independence of $px_k(G)$ and $rx_k(G)$.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{independence}\nFor every pair of positive integers $a$, $b$ with $2\\leq a\\leq b$, there exists a connected graph $G$ such that $px_k(G)=a$ and $rx_k(G)=b$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\\end{thm}\n{\\noindent {\\it Proof.} } For each pair of positive integers $a$, $b$ with $2\\leq a\\leq b$, let $G$ be a nontrivial tree with order $n=b+1$ and maximum degree $\\Delta(G)=a$. The existence of such a tree is guaranteed by $2\\leq a\\leq b$. Then based on Theorem \\ref{trees} and Lemma \\ref{rtrees}, we know that $px_k(G)=\\Delta(G)=a$ and $rx_k(G)=n-1=b$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$. The proof is thus complete. {\\hfill \\nopagebreak\\rule{5pt}{8pt}}\n\n\\section{Graphs with $k$-proper index $n-1$, $n-2$}\\label{Characterize}\nIn this section, we are going to characterize the graphs whose $k$-proper index equals to $n-1$ and $n-2$, respectively, where $3\\leq k\\leq n$. First of all, we give the following lemma that will be used in the sequel.\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{S_n++}\nFor $n\\geq 5$, let $S_n^+$ be the graph obtained by adding a new edge to the $n$-vertices star $S_n$, and $S_n^{++}$ be the graph obtained by adding a new edge to $S_n^+$. Then we have $px_k(S_n^{++})\\leq n-3$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\\end{lem}\n{\\noindent {\\it Proof.} } Let $V(S_n^+)=V(S_n^{++})=\\{u,v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_{n-1}\\}$. Without loss of generality, set $d_{S_n^+}(u)=d_{S_n^{++}}(u)=n-1$ and $d_{S_n^+}(v_1)=d_{S_n^+}(v_2)=2$. Further, let $e$ be the edge of $S_n^{++}$ added to $S_n^+$. We split the remaining proof into the following two cases depending on the position of $e$.\n\n{\\bf Case 1.} The edges $e$ and $v_1v_2$ are vertex-disjoint. Without loss of generality, let $e=v_3v_4$. Then, $G'=G-uv_1-uv_3$ is a spanning tree of $S_n^{++}$ with maximum degree $n-1-2=n-3$. It follows from Theorem \\ref{trees} that $px_k(G')=\\Delta(G')=n-3$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Hence, Proposition \\ref{subgraph} deduces that $px_k(S_n^{++})\\leq px_k(G')=n-3$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\n{\\bf Case 2.} The edges $e$ and $v_1v_2$ have a common vertex. Without loss of generality, let $e=v_2v_3$. Then, $G''=G-uv_2-uv_3$ is a spanning tree of $S_n^{++}$ with maximum degree $n-1-2=n-3$. Similarly, $px_k(G'')=\\Delta(G'')=n-3$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Hence, we can also get $px_k(S_n^{++})\\leq px_k(G'')=n-3$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\nCombining the above two cases, now the lemma follows. {\\hfill \\nopagebreak\\rule{5pt}{8pt}}\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{n-1}\nLet $G$ be a connected graph of order $n \\ (n\\geq 4)$. Then for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$, $px_k(G)=n-1$ if and only if $G\\cong S_n$, where $S_n$ is the star of order $n$.\n\\end{thm}\n{\\noindent {\\it Proof.} } Firstly, if $G\\cong S_n$, then by Theorem \\ref{trees}, we directly obtain $px_k(G)=px_k(S_n)=\\Delta(S_n)=n-1$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\nConversely, suppose $G$ is a graph with $px_k(G)=n-1$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Since $n-1=px_k(G)\\leq \\Delta(G)$ by Proposition \\ref{upperbound2}, meanwhile $\\Delta(G)\\leq n-1$ holds for any simple graph with order $n$. Then, $\\Delta(G)=n-1$. The hypothesis is true if $G\\cong S_n$. If $G\\ncong S_n$, let $u$ be a vertex of $G$ with $d(u)=\\Delta(G)=n-1$. Let $V(G)\\backslash u=\\{v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_{n-1}\\}$ denote the set of the remaining vertices in $G$. Since $G\\ncong S_n$, there exist at least two vertices, say $v_1$ and $v_2$, such that they are adjacent in $G$. Set $G'=G[\\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}uv_i]+v_1v_2$. Then, as $n\\geq 4$, $G'$ is a unicyclic graph satisfying the conditions in Case 2 of Theorem \\ref{unicyclic} with maximum degree $n-1$. Hence, $px_k(G')=\\Delta(G')-1=n-2$ based on the result of Theorem \\ref{unicyclic}. Apparently, $G'$ is a spanning subgraph of $G$, therefore $px_k(G)\\leq px_k(G')=n-2$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$ according to Proposition \\ref{subgraph}, contradicting our assumption that $px_k(G)=n-1$. Consequently, $G\\cong S_n$.\n\nThe proof is thus complete.  {\\hfill \\nopagebreak\\rule{5pt}{8pt}}\n\n{\\bf Remark:} If $G$ is a graph with order $n=3$, then one can check that $px_3(G)=n-1=2$ if and only if $G\\cong S_3$ or $G\\cong C_3$.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{n-2}\nLet $G$ be a connected graph of order $n \\ (n\\geq 5)$. Then for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq n$, $px_k(G)=n-2$ if and only if $G\\cong S_n^+$ or $G_0$, where $S_n^+$ is defined in Lemma \\ref{S_n++} and $G_0$ is shown in Figure \\ref{fig1}.\n\\end{thm}\n{\\noindent {\\it Proof.} } On the one hand, if $G\\cong S_n^+$, then $G$ is a unicyclic graph with maximum degree $n-1$ satisfying the conditions in Case 2 of Theorem \\ref{unicyclic}. Thus $px_k(G)=px_k(S_n^+)=\\Delta(G)-1=n-2$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. If $G\\cong G_0$, then $G$ is a tree with order $n\\geq 5$ and maximum degree $n-2$. Accordingly, by Theorem \\ref{trees}, $px_k(G)=px_k(G_0)=\\Delta(G)=n-2$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$.\n\nOn the other hand, if $px_k(G)=n-2$, then by Proposition \\ref{upperbound2}, $\\Delta(G)\\geq px_k(G)=n-2$, which means that $\\Delta(G)=n-2$ or $n-1$. The remaining proof is divided into two cases depending on the value of $\\Delta(G)$.\n\n{\\bf Case 1.} $\\Delta(G)=n-1$.\\\\\nIn this case, since $px_k(S_n)=n-1$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$, as shown before, then $G$ must contain $S_n^+$ as a connected spanning subgraph. If $G\\cong S_n^+$, we have known that $px_k(S_n^+)=n-2$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. Now suppose $G\\ncong S_n^+$. Then there exists a connected spanning subgraph with the form of $S_n^{++}$ in $G$. Applying Proposition \\ref{subgraph} together with Lemma \\ref{S_n++}, we arrive at $px_k(G)\\leq px_k(S_n^{++})\\leq n-3$, a contradiction. Hence, $G\\cong S_n^+$ in this case.\n\n{\\bf Case 2.} $\\Delta(G)=n-2$.\\\\\nThen $G_0$ must be a connected spanning subgraph of $G$. If $G\\cong G_0$, then $px_k(G_0)=n-2$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$. If $G\\ncong G_0$, then there exists at least one edge $e\\in E(G)\\setminus E(G_0)$. Thus, $G$ contains a connected spanning subgraph isomorphic to $G_1$, $G_2$ or $G_3$, where $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$ are shown in Figure \\ref{fig1}. Clearly, one can check that $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$ are all unicyclic graphs with maximum degree $n-2$ satisfying the conditions in Case 2 of Theorem \\ref{unicyclic}. Thereupon, by Theorem \\ref{unicyclic} as well as Proposition \\ref{subgraph}, we directly get that $px_k(G)\\leq px_k(G_i)=\\Delta(G_i)-1=n-3$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$ and $i=1,2$ or $3$, which is a contradiction. Accordingly, $G\\cong G_0$ in this case.\n\nIn summary, if $px_k(G)=n-2$ for $3\\leq k\\leq n$, then $G\\cong S_n^+$ or $G\\cong G_0$. And the proof of this theorem is complete.  {\\hfill \\nopagebreak\\rule{5pt}{8pt}}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h,t,b,p]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale = 0.7]{fig.eps}\n\\caption{The graphs $G_i$ for $i=0,1,2,3$.}\\label{fig1}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n{\\bf Remark:} When $n=4$, except for the star $S_4$, other connected graphs with order $4$ are all traceable. Then by Proposition \\ref{traceable}, the $k$-proper indices of these graphs equal to $2=n-2$ for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq 4$. While for the star $S_4$, we know that $px_k(S_4)=3$ for $3\\leq k\\leq 4$. Consequently, we can easily claim that if $G$ is a connected graph of order $n=4$, then for each integer $k$ with $3\\leq k\\leq 4$, $px_k(G)=n-2=2$ if and only if $G\\ncong S_4$.\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\n\n\\bibitem{ALLZ}\nE.
