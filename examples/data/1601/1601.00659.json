Using three-dimensional simulations of local regions of \nthe interstellar medium, we explore the impact of high velocity dispersions that arise from these disk instabilities. \nParametrizing disks by their surface densities and  epicyclic frequencies, we conduct a series of simulations \nthat probe a broad range of conditions. Turbulence is driven purely horizontally and on large scales, neglecting \nany energy input from supernovae. We find that such motions lead to strong global outflows in the highly-compact \ndisks that were common at high redshifts, but weak or negligible mass loss in the more diffuse disks that are \nprevalent today. Substantial outflows are generated  if the one-dimensional horizontal velocity dispersion exceeds \n$\\approx 35\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}},$ as occurs in the dense disks that have star formation rate densities above  \n$\\approx 0.1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}.$ These outflows are triggered by a thermal \nrunaway, arising from the inefficient cooling of  hot material coupled with successive heating from turbulent driving. \nThus, even in the absence of  stellar feedback, a critical value of the star-formation rate density for outflow generation \ncan arise due to a turbulent heating instability. This suggests that in strongly self-gravitating disks, outflows may be \nenhanced by, but need not caused by, energy input from supernovae.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{galaxies : evolution - galaxies : starburst - ISM : structure}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{intro}\n\nMulti-wavelength observations reveal the existence of massive, galaxy-scale outflows of multiphase material, \ndriven from rapidly star-forming galaxies  \\citep{HAM90, Bomans+97, Pettini+01, Weiner+09, Martin+13, Rubin+14}. \nSuch outflows  are thought to play a fundamental role in galaxy evolution: enriching the intergalactic medium (IGM) \n\\citep{SC96, SSR02, Pichon+03, Schaye+03, Ferrara+05, Scann+06, Steidel+10, Martin+10}, shaping the galaxy \nmass-metallicity  relation \\citep{DS86, Tremonti+04, Erb+06, KE08, Mannucci10}, and affecting the baryonic content \nand number density  of dwarf galaxies \\citep{SP99, CLBF00, SFM02, Bens+03}. Outflows also aid in eliminating \nsmall-scale random magnetic fields from galactic disks \\citep{SSSB06, SSS07, CSSS14}, thereby preventing the \nlarge-scale dynamo from undergoing catastrophic quenching. Yet despite their  importance, understanding the \ndynamical and microphysical processes that control the evolution of galaxy outflows remains a challenge. \n\nOne difficulty in understanding these processes stems from the complex physics of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nwhere heating by UV photons, cosmic rays, and supernova shocks operate  in combination with \nradiative cooling processes, leading to a multiphase, supersonic medium. Given the extremely short cooling times \nand the importance of small physical scales, simulations with $\\approx$ parsec resolution are required to model the \nmultiphase gas distribution and expansion of supernova remnants directly \\citep[e.g.,][]{dAB04, Hill+12, HI14, Walch+14, \nGiri+15, KO15}.  In particular, neither the correct mass of hot gas nor the correct momentum injected to the ISM by \nsupernovae can be captured unless both the Sedov and shell formation stages are sufficiently well resolved \\citep{KO15}. \nThus, galaxy-scale numerical simulations have instead relied on a number of approximations, including: temporarily \nlowering the densities and cooling rates of heated particles \\citep{GI97, TC00,  Stinson+06, Governato+07}, using an \nempirical heating function \\citep{MMN89, MF99}, imposing an artificial  temperature floor \\citep{Suchkov+94, TT98, \nFujita+04}, and implementing exaggerated momentum kicks  \\citep{NW93, MH94}, and in the case of feedback from \nactive galactic nuclei, storing the energy until it is sufficient to raise the temperature of the surrounding gas above a \nthreshold value \\citep{VS12}.\n\nThe connection to observations is further complicated by recent claims that instead of supernovae, outflows could \nprimarily  be driven by radiation pressure on dust \\citep{TQM05, MMT11,Hopkins+11,Hopkins+12} or by \nnon-thermal pressure contributed by  cosmic rays \\citep{Soc+08, SSS10, U+12, Booth+13, Han+13, SB14}. \nIn addition, the typically high ISM Reynolds numbers of  ${\\rm Re} \\approx 10^{5}$ or greater, imply that a complete \nunderstanding of these massive outflows cannot be obtained by ignoring small-scale turbulent structures. \nInterestingly, using a numerical sub-grid model for the unresolved turbulent velocities and length scales, \n\\citet{SB10} showed that it was  possible to produce outflows of multiphase material arising from simultaneous \nturbulent heating and radiative cooling in the disk. Notwithstanding the approximate nature of the scheme \nemployed, this offers support to the standard picture that massive, galaxy scale outflows can indeed be \nproduced from  turbulence in the disk. \n\nOne hint as to the physics of galaxy outflows may lie in the properties of the galaxies that host them.  \nOutflows are observed over a wide range of galaxy masses, but in a smaller range of galaxy surface densities. \nLarge outflows are ubiquitous in galaxies in which the star-formation rate density per \nunit area exceeds a critical value of $\\dot{\\Sigma}_\\star^{\\rm cr} \\approx 0.1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}$ \n\\citep{Heckman02, H03}, while the ejection of material is more sporadic for \n$\\dot{\\Sigma}_\\star < \\dot{\\Sigma}_\\star^{\\rm cr}$ values \\citep{Chen+10}. \nRecent observations also show that disks with strong outflows are characterized by velocity dispersions between\n$\\sigma_{\\rm v}^{\\rm 1D} \\approx 50-100\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ \\citep{Genzel+11,Swinbank+11}. Such high  \nvelocities are difficult to obtain from supernovae acting alone, as high-resolution simulations of the ISM with a wide \nrange of SN rates show that such explosions can only drive velocities to\n$\\approx 10-20\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ \n\\citep{DBB06,JM06,JMB09,KKO11,KOK13, SO12, HI14, Gatto+15, Martizzi+15}. Therefore, how does \none account for such high velocity dispersions in these disks?\n\nA possible solution lies in the gravitationally-driven motions that occur in high surface density disks. The Toomre \nstability criterion \\citep{T64} relates the total disk surface density $\\Sigma$, the epicyclic frequency $\\kappa$, and \nthe sound speed $c_s$ in infinitesimally thin disks that are marginally unstable to axisymmetric modes as\n$Q \\equiv \\kappa\\,c_{s}/\\pi\\,G\\,\\Sigma = 1$, where $G$ is the gravitational constant. Allowing for \nnon-axisymmetric instabilities, magnetic fields, and interaction with a stellar disk increases the critical $Q$ value, \nwhile thick disk effects decrease it \\citep[e.g.,][]{Romeo92, KO01, KOS02, KO07, RF13}. \nIn the real ISM, turbulent velocities are comparable to the thermal sound speed of the \nwarm medium and are greater than the thermal sound speed of the cold medium. Thus any characterization of the \neffective $Q$ should depend on the total (thermal plus scale-dependent turbulent) velocity dispersion \\citep{RBA10,HR12}.\nIn addition, ISM turbulence is driven by a combination of feedback from star formation and gravitational instabilities, \nand characterizing stability in realistic disks is therefore quite complex \\citep{ARG15}. However, both Milky-Way \ntype galaxies simulations \\citep{WMN02, Agertz+09, ARG15} and high-redshift galaxy simulations\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Imm+04, CDB10, Genel+12, GDC12} show that at sufficiently large scales \ngravitational instabilities promote an increase of the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma,$ until \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nQ_{\\rm eff} \\equiv [\\sigma^{2} + c_{s}^{2}]^{1/2} \\kappa/\\pi G\\Sigma \\approx 1.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Q_{\\rm eff}\\equiv[\\sigma^{2}+c_{s}^{2}]^{1/2}\\kappa/\\pi G\\Sigma\\approx 1.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>Q</mi><mi>eff</mi></msub><mo>\u2261</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><msup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>c</mi><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03ba</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a3</mi></mrow><mo>\u2248</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00659.tex", "nexttext": " \nAs we shall show, the horizontally-driven turbulence also leads to vertical motions (at a lower amplitude), and the shocks \nfrom both horizontal and vertical motions heat the gas.

As Figure~\\ref{cool_curve} shows, we have only considered cooling in the temperature \nrange $T \\approx 10^{3} - 10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$ and up to a maximum density of $n_{\\rm max} = 6.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,{\\rm cm^{-3}}$.\nWe note that the colder parts of the ISM occupy a small fraction of the volume (only a few percent), and while they \nare important for star formation, they interact much less strongly with the hot medium than the warm gas that occupies\nmost of the volume. \nSince our goal is to capture the formation of galaxy outflows which are mainly comprised of hot gas in the temperature \nrange $T \\approx 10^{6} - 10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$, we to lowest order neglect the inclusion of the cold dense phases of the \nISM in our simulations. We therefore do not include low-temperature cooling instead placing a temperature floor at \n1000 K throughout the simulations. This therefore amounts to adopting a simplified description of the multi-phase ISM, \nwhich as we shall show in later sections is sufficient for the physical problem at hand. In a test case, we \nlowered the temperature floor to $300$ K and found the mass outflow rates to remain unchanged (see Appendix). \n\nAt temperatures $T \\approx 10^{4}-10^{6.5}\\,{\\rm K}$, cooling results mainly from  line emission, \nwhile cooling due to bremsstrahlung (free-free emission) becomes important at temperatures \n$\\geqslant 10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$. \nBelow $10^{4}\\,{\\rm K}$, collisions are not energetic enough to excite atomic transitions, \nleading to a drop in the cooling rate. \nThe atomic cooling rate attains a  peak value of $\\Lambda\\approx 10^{-21}\\,{\\rm ergs\\,cm^{3}\\,s^{-1}}$ in the \ntemperature range $T \\approx (1 - 2.5)\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$. In this regime, the cooling time is \nroughly constant as seen in the lower panel of the plot. The peak at $T\\approx 2.5\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$ is \ndominated by line emission from metal ions, whose atomic energy levels are easily excited by collisions \nat this temperature. However, beyond $T\\approx 2.5\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$, most of the atoms become fully \nionized, the effectiveness of the line cooling decreases, and the cooling rate drops, leading to a \ngradual increase in the cooling time. What this implies for the nature of the multiphase medium will be \ndiscussed in the next section. \n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\\label{results}\n\n\\subsection{Outflow Rates}\n\nAs our goal is to obtain a better understanding of the turbulent ISM as a function of galaxy properties, we conducted\n a suite of simulations with different values of the gas surface \ndensity, $\\Sigma_{\\rm g},$ and the epicyclic frequency, $\\kappa$.

From these studies, the dependence of  \ngalaxy size with redshift selected at a constant stellar mass can be roughly characterized as a power \nlaw of the form $R \\propto (1+z)^{-\\alpha},$ although \\citet{Ferg+04} find $ R \\propto H^{-1}(z)$ from $z \\approx 1-5$,  \nwhere $H(z)$ is the Hubble parameter. \nAssuming, for simplicity, a power law relation between the galaxy size and redshift,   it can be \nshown that the epicyclic frequency for a fixed mass, scales as $\\kappa\\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm g}^{1/2}\\,(1+z)^{\\alpha/2},$ \nwhile the surface density at fixed mass scales as $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}\\propto(1+z)^{2\\alpha}$. \nThese scalings imply that star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts are both more compact \n(i.e., have larger values of $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$) and are more rapidly rotating (i.e., have lower values of $\\kappa^{-1}$) \nthan their local counterparts.  As we show below, this allows us to make some quantitative statements \nabout the role of gravity-driven turbulence in powering outflows in distant galaxies.

These volume \nrenderings show the evolution of an outflow with plumes moving gradually both upwards and downwards from \nthe midplane, eventually leaving the simulation domain.\nNote that the question of whether the ejected material is able to leave the simulation domain depends on \nwhether the outflow velocity exceeds the escape velocity, which varies from simulation to simulation in our study.\nSpecifically, given the vertical extent of the box above the \nmidplane and the gas surface density, the critical velocity required to escape the gravitational potential of the \nhost galaxy is given by \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": "\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $n = \\rho/\\mu\\,m_{p}$ is the number density of the gas. \n\n \nFollowing the nomenclature introduced by \\citet{Wolf+95, Wolf+03}, much of the interstellar medium can be described \nas comprised of a cold neutral medium (CNM) with $T  \\approx 100{\\rm K}$, a warm neutral medium (WNM) with \ntemperatures in the range, $T \\approx 6\\times 10^{3} - 10^{4}\\,{\\rm K}$ and a hot ionized medium (HIM) with \n$T \\geq 10^{6}\\,{\\rm K}$. As Figure~\\ref{cool_curve} shows, we have only considered cooling in the temperature \nrange $T \\approx 10^{3} - 10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$ and up to a maximum density of $n_{\\rm max} = 6.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,{\\rm cm^{-3}}$.\nWe note that the colder parts of the ISM occupy a small fraction of the volume (only a few percent), and while they \nare important for star formation, they interact much less strongly with the hot medium than the warm gas that occupies\nmost of the volume. \nSince our goal is to capture the formation of galaxy outflows which are mainly comprised of hot gas in the temperature \nrange $T \\approx 10^{6} - 10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$, we to lowest order neglect the inclusion of the cold dense phases of the \nISM in our simulations. We therefore do not include low-temperature cooling instead placing a temperature floor at \n1000 K throughout the simulations. This therefore amounts to adopting a simplified description of the multi-phase ISM, \nwhich as we shall show in later sections is sufficient for the physical problem at hand. In a test case, we \nlowered the temperature floor to $300$ K and found the mass outflow rates to remain unchanged (see Appendix). \n\nAt temperatures $T \\approx 10^{4}-10^{6.5}\\,{\\rm K}$, cooling results mainly from  line emission, \nwhile cooling due to bremsstrahlung (free-free emission) becomes important at temperatures \n$\\geqslant 10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$. \nBelow $10^{4}\\,{\\rm K}$, collisions are not energetic enough to excite atomic transitions, \nleading to a drop in the cooling rate. \nThe atomic cooling rate attains a  peak value of $\\Lambda\\approx 10^{-21}\\,{\\rm ergs\\,cm^{3}\\,s^{-1}}$ in the \ntemperature range $T \\approx (1 - 2.5)\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$. In this regime, the cooling time is \nroughly constant as seen in the lower panel of the plot. The peak at $T\\approx 2.5\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$ is \ndominated by line emission from metal ions, whose atomic energy levels are easily excited by collisions \nat this temperature. However, beyond $T\\approx 2.5\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$, most of the atoms become fully \nionized, the effectiveness of the line cooling decreases, and the cooling rate drops, leading to a \ngradual increase in the cooling time. What this implies for the nature of the multiphase medium will be \ndiscussed in the next section. \n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\\label{results}\n\n\\subsection{Outflow Rates}\n\nAs our goal is to obtain a better understanding of the turbulent ISM as a function of galaxy properties, we conducted\n a suite of simulations with different values of the gas surface \ndensity, $\\Sigma_{\\rm g},$ and the epicyclic frequency, $\\kappa$.

From these studies, the dependence of  \ngalaxy size with redshift selected at a constant stellar mass can be roughly characterized as a power \nlaw of the form $R \\propto (1+z)^{-\\alpha},$ although \\citet{Ferg+04} find $ R \\propto H^{-1}(z)$ from $z \\approx 1-5$,  \nwhere $H(z)$ is the Hubble parameter. \nAssuming, for simplicity, a power law relation between the galaxy size and redshift,   it can be \nshown that the epicyclic frequency for a fixed mass, scales as $\\kappa\\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm g}^{1/2}\\,(1+z)^{\\alpha/2},$ \nwhile the surface density at fixed mass scales as $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}\\propto(1+z)^{2\\alpha}$. \nThese scalings imply that star-forming galaxies at higher redshifts are both more compact \n(i.e., have larger values of $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$) and are more rapidly rotating (i.e., have lower values of $\\kappa^{-1}$) \nthan their local counterparts.  As we show below, this allows us to make some quantitative statements \nabout the role of gravity-driven turbulence in powering outflows in distant galaxies.

In both figures, we plot the mass-weighted one-dimensional horizontal velocity dispersion, \n{\\bf $\\sigma^{\\rm 1D}_{\\rm H} = \\sigma_{\\rm H}/\\sqrt{2}$}, the vertical velocity dispersion, $\\sigma_{\\rm z}$,\n the mass-weighted rms Mach number, and the gas mass surface density.  \nIn both of these runs, the initial time evolution is marked by a transient phase, which lasts for $60$ Myr and \n$200$ Myr respectively (denoted by the dashed vertical lines), after which the system reaches a steady state.\nIn this stage, the action of gravity in the absence of turbulent support causes \nthe material to move downwards towards the mid plane and become compressed. Then as turbulence \ndevelops, pressure support also increases, puffing the layer back up, and causing a rapid expansion \nthat drives a small fraction of the material out of the simulation volume. During these rearrangements, our results \nare strongly dependent on the particulars of our initial conditions, and so we avoid making measurements or \ndrawing conclusions from this phase of the simulations. \n\nOn the other hand, after the initial phase has passed, the simulations settle into a quasi-steady state that depends \nalmost purely on $\\Sigma_{\\rm g} $ and $\\kappa.$  We thus evaluate the time-averaged values in Table~\\ref{sumsim} \nonly in this quasi-steady state. By this time, the medium in the S250K10 run settles into a roughly constant \nmass-weighted 1D horizontal velocity dispersion of $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D} = 50\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ while the \nmedium in the SK50K30 run reaches $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D}  = 30\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. While the higher surface \ndensity run is somewhat hotter than the moderate surface density case, in both runs the sound speed is well below \nthe average velocity dispersion.  This implies that the turbulent motions are supersonic in nature. \nIn fact, the mass weighted rms Mach number $\\approx 6$ for the higher surface density run and \n$\\approx 4$ in the lower surface density run, signifying the occurrence of strong shocks in both runs.\nThus, although the driving in these simulations is purely \nhorizontal, it also causes substantial pressure and density perturbations, which vary both horizontally and vertically. \nThese lead in turn to vertical velocity fluctuations, which are roughly constant in time at \n$\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm z} = 5.5\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the S250K10 case and $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm z}  = 6\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in \nthe S50K30 case. This shows that the presence of supernova energy input is not required for high-density disks to \ndevelop significant turbulent motions perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy, provided large-scale self-gravitating \ninstabilities are able to maintain horizontal motions of several tens of ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.\nQuite remarkably, as Table~\\ref{sumsim} shows, the value of the time averaged mass-weighted vertical velocity \ndispersion is consistently within the range from $5 - 6.3\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in our simulations, which we discuss in \nmore detail below.\n\nA closer look at these plots also reveals that for the S250K10 run, a distinct outflow occurs throughout the full \nquasi-steady state evolution (see panel 4c), persisting over many eddy-turnover times until the simulation is \nterminated at $t =  330\\, {\\rm Myr.}$  This is also evident from the two-dimensional $x-z$ slices of the density, \nvertical component of the velocity, and temperature in Figure~\\ref{s500k10}. Here we see that, in course \nof the evolution, the combined action of turbulent heating, radiative cooling, and gravitational collapse leads to \nstrong density and temperature contrasts throughout the simulation. Furthermore, the slices of the density plotted \nin the first row of this figure, together with the vertical velocity plotted in the second row, clearly show an outflow \nof material.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.8\\columnwidth]{fig6.pdf}\n\\caption{(color online).

To answer this question, we \nreturn to the  total atomic, ionic, and Bremsstrahlung cooling curve in Figure~\\ref{cool_curve}. The temperature \nslices in Figure~\\ref{s500k10} show that by $t=311\\,{\\rm Myr}$, the initial constant temperature distribution has \nevolved into a multiphase structure. In particular, material in certain regions close to the mid plane is heated to \n$T\\approx 10^{6}\\,{\\rm K}$ and higher, while some patches of gas are still close to a few times $10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$.  \nAt the same time, Figure~\\ref{cool_curve}, shows that beyond $T\\approx 2.5\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$, the radiative \ncooling rate decreases. This implies that these regions would take many dynamical times to cool to the mean \ntemperature of the medium. But by then, successive heating resulting from turbulent driving would further heat the \nmaterial. \n\nThis behavior is also expected from a linear stability analysis of a temperature perturbation in a medium in which \nthe cooling rate per unit mass is $\\propto \\rho \\Lambda(T)$, and the heating rate per unit mass is roughly constant, \nas is the case with turbulent heating \\citep{PP09}.\nIn this case, the the condition for such a perturbation to grow exponentially (at constant pressure) is simply\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 36130, "prevtext": " \nwhere $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity and in the last equality, we have assumed $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2}\\Omega$, as \nappropriate for a flat rotation curve.

Comparing with the gas mass loss rate plotted in panel 2(a), we find that runs S50K30, \nS75K30, S50K20 and S75K20 show very weak outflows (i.e. below the threshold value of \n$0.02\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}$).\nAmong the other two runs, the mass loss rates in S100K20 and S150K20 are on and above the threshold \nvalue respectively.

Certainly, in real galaxies, much of the hottest of these phases is in fact material \nfrom supernovae. On the other hand, the presence of $\\approx10^{6}\\,{\\rm K}$ gas may provide pockets in which the \ncooling of material shocked by supernova remnants is minimal, making such galaxies particularly prone to outflows. \nOr in other words, gravitationally-driven turbulence is likely to both drive a baseline outflow as well as provide an \nISM distribution in which supernova driving is particularly efficient. \n \nFigure~\\ref{phaseplots} shows the phase distributions of the gas for three different runs, including  \nthe temperature-density distribution over the whole simulation volume and the temperature-velocity distribution\nof the gas at high latitudes. In the $T-n$ plots, $T = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$ is denoted by the horizontal line, \nabove which the cooling rate starts to decrease. The vertical lines in the plots denote the densities at which\nthe cooling time at $T = 2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$ is equal to the eddy turnover time. To the left of this line \nand for $T > 2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$, the cooling time is greater than $t_{\\rm ed},$ while to the right, \n$t_{\\rm cool} < t_{\\rm ed}$. In all three plots, we find the existence of a horizontal, high density tail at \n$T \\approx 10^{4}\\,{\\rm K}$; a feature commonly seen in phase diagrams in ISM simulations. \nIn the S50K30 case, corresponding to a slowly rotating, moderate surface density galaxy, \na majority of material is below the threshold temperature of $2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$. This run has only negligible \nmass loss, and the $T-v_{\\rm z}$ plots show that the vertical component of the velocity corresponding to the gas \nnear the top boundary is $50-100\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}},$ as compared to the escape velocity of 143 km/s.\n\nOn the other hand, in both S250K10 with $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D}=50$ ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ and S500K6.5 \nwith $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D}=68$ ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$, more of the low density gas above the disk mid plane is \nat considerably higher temperatures than the temperature at which the cooling time is equal to the eddy turnover time. \nDue to the longer cooling time, this gas becomes thermally unstable and leads to a rapid, runaway heating\nresulting in an eventual expulsion of the gas from the host galaxy, dragging along additional material with it. \nThus, such high density, faster spinning disks are more likely to host galaxy outflows than their slow rotating less \ndenser counterparts. The mass-weighted phase plots of the temperature and the vertical component of the velocity \nfor S250K10 and S500K6.5 show that the outflowing gas is made up of a combination of phases with most of the \nmass in the hot phase at $T\\approx 10^{6}-10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$ which also drags along some relatively low temperature \ngas as it escapes the galaxy. In both cases the vertical velocities range from $\\approx 100\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ to close \nto the escape velocity, which is 238 ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the S250K10 case and 309 ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the \nS500K6.5 case.\n\n\n\\subsection{Turbulent Parameters and Vertical Scale Heights} \n\nTo further explore the connection between the mass loss rate and the structure of the disk, we measured \nhow  turbulent velocities and vertical scale-heights vary with our  input parameters, $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$ \nand $\\kappa.$  In Figure \\ref{veldis}, the filled (open) symbols follow the classification of disks hosting\noutflows above (below) $0.02\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}$, similar to those in panel \n2(a) of Figure~\\ref{starform}. Comparing the mass loss rate with the one-dimensional horizontal velocity \ndispersion, we find that with the exception of S75K30, strong outflows are ubiquitous \nin systems where $\\bar{\\sigma}^{\\rm 1D}_{\\rm H} \\geqslant 32\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.  \nThis is in agreement with \nthe earlier numerical \\citep{SGP12} and analytical predictions \\citep{Scann13}, which argued that \nprovided turbulent velocities can be maintained\nabove this threshold value (about $35\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in \ntheir paper), the material is shocked into the thermally unstable regime, leading to runaway heating and \neventual expulsion from the galaxy.\nA compilation of a large sample of high-redshift data by \\citet{Genzel+11} also shows that galaxies with \n$\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star}\\geqslant \\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star}^{\\rm cr}$ have \n$\\sigma_{\\rm H\\alpha}^{\\rm 1D}\\geqslant 35\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. \nOn the other hand, the vertical velocity dispersion varies \nonly weakly across the entire parameter space with a mean value of $5.7\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=2.0\\columnwidth]{fig9.pdf} \n\\caption{(color online).\nThe different panels shows the variation of the following quantities as a function of the gas surface density \nfor different ranges of the epicyclic frequency.

Intriguingly, \nthe small and nearly constant value of $\\sigma_{\\rm z}$ with the gas surface density is quite similar to the results \nfrom simulations in which turbulence is driven by supernovae, with a star formation rate set self-consistently by \nlocal gravitational collapse \\citep{KKO11, SO12, KOK13}. \nHowever, for turbulence driven by gravitational instability, the plot of $\\bar{\\sigma}^{\\rm 1D}_{\\rm H}/\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm z}$ \nin panel 9(c) suggests that turbulent velocities become increasingly {\\it anisotropic} with increasing gas surface density. \nFor a constant $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$, the anisotropy increases for slowly rotating disks. \n\nThe variation of the imposed horizontal forcing scale, $L_{\\rm f}\\approx R \\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm g}/\\kappa^2$ \nis shown for reference in panel 9(d). At constant $\\kappa^{-1}$, the forcing scale is directly proportional to the gas \nsurface density, while at constant $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$, slower rotating disks have a larger forcing scale.

In both figures, we plot the mass-weighted one-dimensional horizontal velocity dispersion, \n{\\bf $\\sigma^{\\rm 1D}_{\\rm H} = \\sigma_{\\rm H}/\\sqrt{2}$}, the vertical velocity dispersion, $\\sigma_{\\rm z}$,\n the mass-weighted rms Mach number, and the gas mass surface density.  \nIn both of these runs, the initial time evolution is marked by a transient phase, which lasts for $60$ Myr and \n$200$ Myr respectively (denoted by the dashed vertical lines), after which the system reaches a steady state.\nIn this stage, the action of gravity in the absence of turbulent support causes \nthe material to move downwards towards the mid plane and become compressed. Then as turbulence \ndevelops, pressure support also increases, puffing the layer back up, and causing a rapid expansion \nthat drives a small fraction of the material out of the simulation volume. During these rearrangements, our results \nare strongly dependent on the particulars of our initial conditions, and so we avoid making measurements or \ndrawing conclusions from this phase of the simulations. \n\nOn the other hand, after the initial phase has passed, the simulations settle into a quasi-steady state that depends \nalmost purely on $\\Sigma_{\\rm g} $ and $\\kappa.$  We thus evaluate the time-averaged values in Table~\\ref{sumsim} \nonly in this quasi-steady state. By this time, the medium in the S250K10 run settles into a roughly constant \nmass-weighted 1D horizontal velocity dispersion of $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D} = 50\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ while the \nmedium in the SK50K30 run reaches $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D}  = 30\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. While the higher surface \ndensity run is somewhat hotter than the moderate surface density case, in both runs the sound speed is well below \nthe average velocity dispersion.  This implies that the turbulent motions are supersonic in nature. \nIn fact, the mass weighted rms Mach number $\\approx 6$ for the higher surface density run and \n$\\approx 4$ in the lower surface density run, signifying the occurrence of strong shocks in both runs.\nThus, although the driving in these simulations is purely \nhorizontal, it also causes substantial pressure and density perturbations, which vary both horizontally and vertically. \nThese lead in turn to vertical velocity fluctuations, which are roughly constant in time at \n$\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm z} = 5.5\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the S250K10 case and $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm z}  = 6\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in \nthe S50K30 case. This shows that the presence of supernova energy input is not required for high-density disks to \ndevelop significant turbulent motions perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy, provided large-scale self-gravitating \ninstabilities are able to maintain horizontal motions of several tens of ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.\nQuite remarkably, as Table~\\ref{sumsim} shows, the value of the time averaged mass-weighted vertical velocity \ndispersion is consistently within the range from $5 - 6.3\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in our simulations, which we discuss in \nmore detail below.\n\nA closer look at these plots also reveals that for the S250K10 run, a distinct outflow occurs throughout the full \nquasi-steady state evolution (see panel 4c), persisting over many eddy-turnover times until the simulation is \nterminated at $t =  330\\, {\\rm Myr.}$  This is also evident from the two-dimensional $x-z$ slices of the density, \nvertical component of the velocity, and temperature in Figure~\\ref{s500k10}. Here we see that, in course \nof the evolution, the combined action of turbulent heating, radiative cooling, and gravitational collapse leads to \nstrong density and temperature contrasts throughout the simulation. Furthermore, the slices of the density plotted \nin the first row of this figure, together with the vertical velocity plotted in the second row, clearly show an outflow \nof material.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.8\\columnwidth]{fig6.pdf}\n\\caption{(color online).

To answer this question, we \nreturn to the  total atomic, ionic, and Bremsstrahlung cooling curve in Figure~\\ref{cool_curve}. The temperature \nslices in Figure~\\ref{s500k10} show that by $t=311\\,{\\rm Myr}$, the initial constant temperature distribution has \nevolved into a multiphase structure. In particular, material in certain regions close to the mid plane is heated to \n$T\\approx 10^{6}\\,{\\rm K}$ and higher, while some patches of gas are still close to a few times $10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$.  \nAt the same time, Figure~\\ref{cool_curve}, shows that beyond $T\\approx 2.5\\times10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$, the radiative \ncooling rate decreases. This implies that these regions would take many dynamical times to cool to the mean \ntemperature of the medium. But by then, successive heating resulting from turbulent driving would further heat the \nmaterial. \n\nThis behavior is also expected from a linear stability analysis of a temperature perturbation in a medium in which \nthe cooling rate per unit mass is $\\propto \\rho \\Lambda(T)$, and the heating rate per unit mass is roughly constant, \nas is the case with turbulent heating \\citep{PP09}.\nIn this case, the the condition for such a perturbation to grow exponentially (at constant pressure) is simply\n\n", "index": 23, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\Lambda}{\\partial \\ln T} < 1,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E12.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{\\partial\\ln\\Lambda}{\\partial\\ln T}&lt;1,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>ln</mi></mrow><mo>\u2061</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>ln</mi></mrow><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00659.tex", "nexttext": "\nSince $\\sigma_{\\rm z}$ remains more or less constant with $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$, and $H \\propto \\sigma_z^2/(G \\Sigma)$, \nthis results in a decrease of the scale height with increasing $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$ independent \nof the value of $\\kappa^{-1}$.

Certainly, in real galaxies, much of the hottest of these phases is in fact material \nfrom supernovae. On the other hand, the presence of $\\approx10^{6}\\,{\\rm K}$ gas may provide pockets in which the \ncooling of material shocked by supernova remnants is minimal, making such galaxies particularly prone to outflows. \nOr in other words, gravitationally-driven turbulence is likely to both drive a baseline outflow as well as provide an \nISM distribution in which supernova driving is particularly efficient. \n \nFigure~\\ref{phaseplots} shows the phase distributions of the gas for three different runs, including  \nthe temperature-density distribution over the whole simulation volume and the temperature-velocity distribution\nof the gas at high latitudes. In the $T-n$ plots, $T = 2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$ is denoted by the horizontal line, \nabove which the cooling rate starts to decrease. The vertical lines in the plots denote the densities at which\nthe cooling time at $T = 2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$ is equal to the eddy turnover time. To the left of this line \nand for $T > 2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$, the cooling time is greater than $t_{\\rm ed},$ while to the right, \n$t_{\\rm cool} < t_{\\rm ed}$. In all three plots, we find the existence of a horizontal, high density tail at \n$T \\approx 10^{4}\\,{\\rm K}$; a feature commonly seen in phase diagrams in ISM simulations. \nIn the S50K30 case, corresponding to a slowly rotating, moderate surface density galaxy, \na majority of material is below the threshold temperature of $2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$. This run has only negligible \nmass loss, and the $T-v_{\\rm z}$ plots show that the vertical component of the velocity corresponding to the gas \nnear the top boundary is $50-100\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}},$ as compared to the escape velocity of 143 km/s.\n\nOn the other hand, in both S250K10 with $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D}=50$ ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ and S500K6.5 \nwith $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm H}^{\\rm 1D}=68$ ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$, more of the low density gas above the disk mid plane is \nat considerably higher temperatures than the temperature at which the cooling time is equal to the eddy turnover time. \nDue to the longer cooling time, this gas becomes thermally unstable and leads to a rapid, runaway heating\nresulting in an eventual expulsion of the gas from the host galaxy, dragging along additional material with it. \nThus, such high density, faster spinning disks are more likely to host galaxy outflows than their slow rotating less \ndenser counterparts. The mass-weighted phase plots of the temperature and the vertical component of the velocity \nfor S250K10 and S500K6.5 show that the outflowing gas is made up of a combination of phases with most of the \nmass in the hot phase at $T\\approx 10^{6}-10^{7}\\,{\\rm K}$ which also drags along some relatively low temperature \ngas as it escapes the galaxy. In both cases the vertical velocities range from $\\approx 100\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ to close \nto the escape velocity, which is 238 ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the S250K10 case and 309 ${\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the \nS500K6.5 case.\n\n\n\\subsection{Turbulent Parameters and Vertical Scale Heights} \n\nTo further explore the connection between the mass loss rate and the structure of the disk, we measured \nhow  turbulent velocities and vertical scale-heights vary with our  input parameters, $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$ \nand $\\kappa.$  In Figure \\ref{veldis}, the filled (open) symbols follow the classification of disks hosting\noutflows above (below) $0.02\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}$, similar to those in panel \n2(a) of Figure~\\ref{starform}. Comparing the mass loss rate with the one-dimensional horizontal velocity \ndispersion, we find that with the exception of S75K30, strong outflows are ubiquitous \nin systems where $\\bar{\\sigma}^{\\rm 1D}_{\\rm H} \\geqslant 32\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.  \nThis is in agreement with \nthe earlier numerical \\citep{SGP12} and analytical predictions \\citep{Scann13}, which argued that \nprovided turbulent velocities can be maintained\nabove this threshold value (about $35\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ in \ntheir paper), the material is shocked into the thermally unstable regime, leading to runaway heating and \neventual expulsion from the galaxy.\nA compilation of a large sample of high-redshift data by \\citet{Genzel+11} also shows that galaxies with \n$\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star}\\geqslant \\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star}^{\\rm cr}$ have \n$\\sigma_{\\rm H\\alpha}^{\\rm 1D}\\geqslant 35\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. \nOn the other hand, the vertical velocity dispersion varies \nonly weakly across the entire parameter space with a mean value of $5.7\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=2.0\\columnwidth]{fig9.pdf} \n\\caption{(color online).\nThe different panels shows the variation of the following quantities as a function of the gas surface density \nfor different ranges of the epicyclic frequency.

Intriguingly, \nthe small and nearly constant value of $\\sigma_{\\rm z}$ with the gas surface density is quite similar to the results \nfrom simulations in which turbulence is driven by supernovae, with a star formation rate set self-consistently by \nlocal gravitational collapse \\citep{KKO11, SO12, KOK13}. \nHowever, for turbulence driven by gravitational instability, the plot of $\\bar{\\sigma}^{\\rm 1D}_{\\rm H}/\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\rm z}$ \nin panel 9(c) suggests that turbulent velocities become increasingly {\\it anisotropic} with increasing gas surface density. \nFor a constant $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$, the anisotropy increases for slowly rotating disks. \n\nThe variation of the imposed horizontal forcing scale, $L_{\\rm f}\\approx R \\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm g}/\\kappa^2$ \nis shown for reference in panel 9(d).

Within the realm of our \nnumerical setup,  horizontal driving always allows for $t_{\\rm ff}/\\bar{t}_{\\rm cool} > 1$ and a multiphase medium, \nbut this is not a sufficient condition for the existence of sustainable outflows.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nGlobal outflows occur across a wide range of galaxy masses and redshifts, and \nobservations suggest that they are most prominent in galaxies in which  the star-formation rate \ndensity exceeds $\\dot{\\Sigma}_\\star \\geqslant 0.1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}$. \nFurthermore,  recent observations show that the ISM in such galaxies has internal velocity dispersions \nof $\\approx 50-100\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ \\citep{SH09, West+09, Law+09, Green+10, Genzel+11, Swinbank+11}.\nHowever, typically numerical simulations with supernova \ndriving attain velocity dispersions of only $\\approx 7-20\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}.$ \nAs current observations are unable to resolve the disk scale height or cleanly determine the orientation of\nrandom velocities  with respect to the plane, it is thus possible that the \nlarge observed velocity dispersions arise not from stellar feedback but from large-scale gravitational instabilities \nin the disk. These will occur on scales $R\\gg H$ and tap into macroscopic differences in the rotation rate and the \ngravitational potential, rather than nuclear processes, to drive large, anisotropic random motions.  \n\nHere we have carried out a first exploration of the possible role of gravitational instabilities in driving\noutflows from high surface-density disk galaxies. \nTo focus on the effect of instabilities rather than the growth and maintenance of these modes, \nwe drive turbulence to a level expected for a Toomre critical disk. \nWithin this framework, we examine the role of two key parameters, namely the gas surface density, $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$ \nand the epicyclic frequency, $\\kappa$. Crucially, only the horizontal turbulence is driven, consistent with \nexpectations for disk instabilities. \nThe advantage of this parametrization, in which $\\sigma_{\\rm H} = \\pi\\,G\\,\\Sigma/\\kappa$, \nis that we are able to control the velocity dispersion by simply adjusting the surface \ndensity of the medium. This allows us to probe a wide variety of disk conditions. \nMoreover as Figures~\\ref{starform}, \\ref{veldis} and \\ref{tscales}\nshow, our approach also enables us to probe the variation of turbulent velocities, \ngas mass loss rates and the various timescales with the gas surface density and \nthe epicyclic frequency. \n\nThe key result arising from our study is that turbulence of the amplitude expected from gravitational \ninstabilities can indeed drive galaxy outflows at a level $\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\rm g}/\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star} \\gtrsim 0.1$,\neven in absence of additional energy input from supernovae. Our models show that global outflows of \nthis kind are likely to be present in the highly compact and rapidly rotating disks that were common at \nhigh redshift, while they are more likely to be weak or completely absent in less compact and slowly \nrotating disks such as our Milky Way. Within the range of the parameter space of \n$\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$ and $\\kappa^{-1}$ that we probed, \n$\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\rm g}\\geqslant 0.02\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}$\n outflows occured in galaxies where the gas surface densities exceeded \n$100 \\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc^{-2}}$ with a lower bound of $\\kappa^{-1}=20\\,{\\rm Myr}$. \nInterestingly, this threshold values is very close to the value of the critical star-formation rate \ndensities  of $\\dot{\\Sigma}_{\\star} > 0.1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}$. \n\nOur results also indicate that outflows arise if the one-dimensional horizontal velocity dispersion \nexceeds a critical value of $\\approx 35\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.   \nWe find that the vertical velocity dispersion has a mean value of $5.7\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$, \nlargely independent of the parameters of our simulation. Such low values are also obtained in ISM simulations \nwhere supernovae feedback is explicitly included \\citep[e.g.,][]{SO12, KOK13}.\nFurthermore, two-dimensional slices in the $x-z$ plane show their disks to be thin and quasi-steady\nover many eddy-turnover times.  \nIn an additional test run, we lowered the temperature floor to 300 K for the S250K10 run and found \nthat the mass outflow rate and the estimate of the mass-weighted $\\sigma_{\\rm z}$ are similar to the \nestimates from the fiducial S250K10 run (see Appendix for a comparison between the two runs). \nThis implies that lowering the temperature floor to capture the dynamics of the cold dense medium is not \ncrucial for outflow generation.\n\nThe occurrence of outflows in our study can be further explained from the thermodynamic properties of the \nISM in these disks. As Figure~\\ref{s500k10} shows, even if one starts with a constant temperature distribution, \nthe ISM in these galaxies soon evolves into a multiphase distribution. Certain regions attain temperatures \nhigher than the critical temperature beyond which the radiative cooling rate progressively \ndecreases. Over the course of the evolution, this results in a runaway arising from inefficient cooling of these \nhot regions coupled with successive heating from turbulent driving. The combined action of these two effects \nleads to the motion of the gas outward through the simulation domain. In a nutshell, the above arguments \nsuggest that in the absence of stellar feedback, outflows from high redshift galaxies can arise from\na turbulent heating instability due to the progressive  decline in the efficiency of radiative cooling beyond \n$T\\approx 2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$. \n\nAs a caveat, we note that the results of this study {\\it assume} that turbulence can be sustained at a steady \nlevel $\\sigma_{\\rm H} \\approx \\pi\\,G\\,\\Sigma_{\\rm g}/\\kappa$ over many local dynamical times, via horizontal \ninstabilities at scales $R\\approx \\pi\\,G\\,\\Sigma_{\\rm g}/\\kappa^{2}$ between the disk \nthickness $(\\sigma_{\\rm z}/\\sigma_{\\rm H})^2R/2 $ and the Toomre wavelength \n$4 \\pi R$. However, previous simulations have shown that without small-scale feedback, gravitationally unstable \ndisks may have SFRs high enough to deplete the local gas within a few orbital times \\citep[e.g.,][]{Hopkins+11, Agertz+13}. \nThis would reduce the spatial scale ($\\propto R$ if Q remains $\\approx 1$) of gravitational instabilities and \nthe corresponding rotational velocity differences that these instabilities can tap, leading to lower \n$\\sigma_{\\rm H} \\approx\\pi\\,G\\,\\Sigma_{\\rm g}/\\kappa$. Thus, a state in which high amplitude turbulence is \nmaintained over many orbital times may require significant accretion of gas from larger scales and/or suppression \nof local collapse by stellar feedback.  We also note here that turbulent driving as implemented in our \nsimulations is insensitive to hot or cold gas in the sense that it is likely to drive both the high density cold \ngas and the low density hot gas in a similar fashion. However, in a realistic environment self-gravity could \ndrive high density and low density gases very differently. The resulting effect on the generation of outflows \nin such systems merits a careful analysis.\n\n\nAn important limitation of our work is the neglect of cold dense phases of the ISM. An accurate modeling of \nthe CNM requires the inclusion of cooling due to both fine structure atomic lines and CO rotational line emission. \nHowever, this would lead to the development of small, very dense structures that would not be spatially resolved \nin some of our present simulations. It would be interesting to include these low temperature processes in the \ncooling routines in a future study with the aim to understand its effect on the generation of galaxy outflows. \n\nAn additional issue with the simulations reported here relates the number of cells by which the length scale \n$l_{\\rm sg} \\approx c_s^{2}/g(z)$,  corresponding to the gravity source term in the momentum equation, is resolved. \nBecause the present  simulations do not follow 3D self-gravitating fragmentation at small scales, the usual \nTruelove criterion ($l_{\\rm J} > 4\\,dx$) for avoiding unphysical excitation of small-scale noise in AMR simulations \ndoes not directly apply. Here, we have  only vertical gravity associated with the integrated surface density of gas, \nwhich is not substantially altered  by grid-scale noise. However, we note that in our simulations we only just \nresolve the Jeans scale for low surface density disks. Thus, fully self-gravitating simulations that seek to \naddress the issues considered in this paper would require substantially higher resolution than we have adopted \nhere.\n\nOur results also raise the question of how energy input from supernovae and gravitational instabilities might  \nwork in conjunction in rapidly star forming galaxies. The outflow rates obtained in our study should be \nthought of as lower limits; stellar processes may or may not lead to additional mass loss. \nInterestingly, the high-surface density disk simulations of \\citet{WN07} showed that the inclusion \nof supernova feedback did not lead to any appreciable change in the morphology or in the density PDF \n(see Figs.~18 and 19 in their paper)  compared to the case where turbulence in the disk solely arose \nfrom gravitational instabilities. However, these simulations only spanned a region $0.32\\,{\\rm kpc}$ in the \nvertical direction which may not be sufficient to draw any immediate conclusions about the combined impact \nof stellar feedback and gravitational instabilities. Among other questions, it will be interesting to explore how \nturbulent velocities resulting from the combined effect of gravitational instabilities and supernova driving scale \nwith disk properties. \nCorrespondingly, it would be interesting to test how star formation rates differ when turbulence is \ndriven by both supernovae and large-scale instabilities. Finally, magnetic fields are an important component \nof the ISM where they play a variety of roles ranging from controlling star formation, influencing turbulent \nmixing \\citep{Sur+14, SPS14}, to the confinement and propagation of cosmic rays. How such fields will affect \nthe conclusions of this study is an open question. These are some of the issues we intend to address in \nforthcoming papers. \n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank William Gray, Christopher Matzner, Prateek Sharma and Robert Thacker for helpful \ndiscussions and the anonymous referee for his/her comments.

performed a resolution study for our fiducial high surface density \ncase: S250K10, with $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$ = 250 ${\\rm M}_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and $\\kappa^{-1}$ = 10 Myr.  This  \ninvolved a single high-resolution $512^{2}\\times 1024$ run, with $dz$ half that of our standard, $256^{2}\\times 512$ \nrun, and two low-resolution runs with $128^{2} \\times 256$ and  $64^{2}\\times 128$ cells, and $dz$ twice and four \ntimes as large as in our standard runs, respectively. In Table~\\ref{resdep}, we show a comparison of the computed \nscale-height, one-dimensional horizontal and vertical velocity dispersions, and gas mass loss rate obtained in these \nfour simulations. We also show the time evolution of $\\Sigma_{\\rm g}$ for each of the runs in Figure~\\ref{mloss_resdep}. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\columnwidth]{fig11.pdf} \n\\caption{(color online). Time evolution of the gas surface density at four different resolutions for initial \n$\\Sigma_{\\rm g} = 250\\,{\\rm M_\\odot\\,pc^{-2}}$, and $\\kappa^{-1} = 10\\,{\\rm Myr}$. \nNote that the gas mass loss rate nears convergence from a resolution of $256^{2}\\times 512,$ with $dz=8.32$ \npc as compared to a vertical scale-height of 11 pc. It is also clear that the run with a temperature floor of \n$300$ K has the same gas mass loss rate as our fiducial S250K10 run. \n}\n\\label{mloss_resdep}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn all four runs, our turbulent driving results in a similar 1D horizontal vertical dispersion $\\approx 50$ km/s.\nTable  \\ref{resdep} also shows that the scale-heights, vertical velocity dispersion, and\ngas mass loss rate are very similar between the standard, $256^{2}\\times 512$  run and the high-resolution, \n$512^{2}\\times 1024$ run in which the scale-heights were resolved by $\\approx 10$ and $20$ cells, respectively.  \nFor the high-resolution run, the gas mass loss rate is computed from $84$ Myr to the end of the simulation. \nHowever, as evident from Figure \\ref{mloss_resdep}, the above two runs differ in their evolution in the initial \ntransient phase. While the $256^{2}\\times 512$ loses about $8.7\\%$ of its initial mass during this phase, the \n$512^{2}\\times 1024$ run loses much less mass during its initial rearrangements. Therefore, barring the estimates \nduring the transient phase, the gas mass loss rate is similar in both the runs. This gives us confidence that \nthe results reported in the paper are not strongly influenced by resolution effects, and that even larger and \nmore expensive simulations are not required to reach reliable conclusions. \nMoreover, by comparing the \ngreen dash-dotted line with the black line, it appears that lowering the temperature floor to $300$ K does not \nresult in any change in the mass outflow rate. Thus, our conclusions regarding the mass outflow rates are \nnot likely to be affected by modeling the low temperature ISM.\n\nMoving to the lower resolution $128^{2} \\times 256$ run, we find that the estimates of the horizontal velocity dispersion, \nvertical  velocity dispersion, and gas mass loss rate is very close to those of the two higher resolution runs. However, \nthe estimate of the scale height falls below the resolution limit and the gas mass loss rate in the transient phase\nis more than the higher resolution runs. For the lowest resolution $64^{2} \\times 128$ run, as Figure~\\ref{mloss_resdep} \nshows, the gas mass loss rate undergoes an extremely sharp decline for about $100$ Myr followed by a steep \ndecline from about $120-160$ Myr. During this phase, the temperature also drops sharply from \n$1.13\\times 10^{6}\\,{\\rm K}$ to $7.8\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$, after which the system reaches a steady state. \nThe mass loss rate shown in the table is computed from $350$ Myr onwards.  \nIn this case, the computed value of the scale height is well below the resolution limit. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.02\\columnwidth]{fig12.pdf} \n\\caption{(color online). Volume-weighted phase diagrams of the temperature and the number \ndensity of all the gas at four different resolutions for the S250K10 run. The vertical and the \nhorizontal lines have the same meaning as in Figure~\\ref{phaseplots}. At both $256^{2}\\times 512$\nand $512^{2}\\times 1024$ resolutions, the phase plots show an accumulation of low density gas \nat $1000$ K as compared to the $128^{2}\\times 256$ run. \n}\n\\label{phase_resdep}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{phase_resdep}, we show the volume-weighted $T-n$ phase plots over the whole simulation domain \nat different resolutions.  The phase  plots are shown at $101$ Myr,\nexcept for the lowest resolution run, which takes much longer to reach a steady-state, and whose phase plot\n is shown at $401$ Myr. From these diagrams it appears that the phase plots are similar for the \n $256^{2}\\times 512$ and the $512^{2}\\times 1024$ resolutions. However compared to the $128^{2}\\times 256$ \nrun, both of these runs show an accumulation of low density gas at $1000$ K. The $128^{2}\\times 256$ \nresolution run also shows some gas at $T = 2.5\\times 10^{5}\\,{\\rm K}$ being dragged along with the hot outflowing gas. \nOn the other hand, the phase plot at $64^{2}\\times 128$ is very different from the other three, the most significant \nbeing the accumulation of high density gas at the temperature floor.\n\n\nThus, while the results presented here are not likely to suffer from resolution effects, they appear to be close to the lowest \nresolution allowable to achieve reliable results, even in the absence of additional physical processes such as stellar feedback, \nmolecular chemistry, cosmic ray heating, and magnetohydrodynamic effects. This means that  cosmological simulations that \nare unable to achieve $\\approx 10$ pc resolutions  will not be able to properly handle the evolution of the ISM in high-surface \ndensity galaxies similar to the S250K10 case, and may instead either over or under-represent gas mass loss depending on the \nparticulars of the numerical method being used.  Furthermore, even higher resolutions are likely to be required to model \noutflows from higher surface density disks with smaller vertical scale heights, even in the case without supernovae.\n\n\\end{appendix}\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 59805, "prevtext": "\nwhere in the last equality we have substituted $\\Sigma_{\\rm g} = \\kappa^{2}\\,R/2\\pi\\,G,$ where $R$ is the size of the \neddy at the forcing scale $L_{\\rm f}$.
