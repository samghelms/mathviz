T.~Kajita and A.B.~McDonald are awarded the Nobel prize in physics for the discovery of the neutrino mass through neutrino oscillations, in 2015.\nIt is an evidence that the studies of the neutrino oscillation are  appreciated for having considerably deepen our understanding of the nature. \n\nIn short, Prof. Kajita's study was detecting atmospheric neutrino \noscillations~\\cite{98SK} and measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters, $\\theta_{23}$ and $\\Delta m_{32}^2$. \nProf. McDonald's study was identifying the transformation of the flavors of solar neutrinos~\\cite{02SNO} and measurement of $\\theta_{12}$ and $\\Delta m_{21}^2$. \nThe Double Chooz (DC) experiment detects another type of neutrino oscillation using reactor neutrinos at a $\\sim 1$~km baseline and is measuring a neutrino mixing parameter, $\\theta_{13}$. \nThis article is to explain the Double Chooz experiment as a part of the special issue of the Nuclear Physics B, for celebrating the Nobel prize. \nThe physics and history of the $\\theta_{13}$ measurement, an overview of the Double Chooz experiment and its results on the neutrino oscillation measurements so far are summarized in the following sections. \n\n\n\\section{Neutrino Oscillation and $\\theta_{13}$}\n\\label{sec:PhysicsTh13}\n\nNeutrino oscillation is a phenomenon that a certain neutrino flavor periodically transforms to other flavor state. \nFor the two flavor case, if there is a transition between $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_\\mu$, just like the transition between flavor eigenstate quarks, $d'$ and $s'$, the state equation of the neutrinos can be expressed effectively as~\\cite{15Suekane}\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ni\\frac{d}{dt}\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\nu_e \\\\ \\nu_\\mu\n

Detector}\n\nSince the $\\overline{\\nu}_e \\to \\overline{\\nu}_e$ disappearance probability expected was $\\sim$10~\\% or less, it was necessary to design the neutrino detector in such a way that the $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ deficit can be measured with an accuracy of $ \\sim 1 \\%$ level.\nTherefore, several techniques which significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties are employed in the Double Chooz detector. \n\n\nDouble Chooz experiment uses the underground laboratory, which was used for the Chooz experiment, for the far detector. \nThe rock overburden is $\\sim$300~meter-water equivalent. \nFig.~\\ref{fig:DC_detector} shows a schematic view of the Double Chooz detector~\\cite{DCDetector}. \n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.0

of a Gadolinium (Gd)-loaded liquid scintillator~\\cite{DCLS}, with a 10~m$^3$ volume, contained in an acrylic vessel. \nThe second liquid layer (ii) is Gd-free liquid scintillator nicknamed $\\gamma$-catcher, which detects $\\gamma$-rays escaping from the target region. \nThe light output efficiency is tuned to be the same as the neutrino target in order to reconstruct the neutrino and Gd signal energy precisely. \nThe volume is 23~m$^3$ and it is contained in the second acrylic vessel.\nThe third liquid layer (iii) is a non scintillating oil called the buffer oil, which shields the background neutrons and $\\gamma$-rays from outside and PMT glass. \nThe volume is 110~m$^3$ and it is contained in a stainless steel vessel. \n(iv) 390 10 inch low-background PMTs~\\cite{DCPMT}, which is mounted inside the stainless steel vessel, detect the scintillation lights from the neutrino target and the $\\gamma$-catcher. \nThe set of the subdetectors: (i) to (iv) defines the Inner Detector (ID).\nThe forth liquid layer (v) is another liquid scintillator, which actively vetoes the cosmic-ray background. \nIts volume is 90~m$^3$ and contained in a stainless steel vessel. This layer is named the Inner Veto (IV) and it is optically separated from the ID~\\cite{DCIV}.\nThere are 15~cm thick demagnetized iron shields outside the tank. \nFinally the whole upper part of the detector is covered by a large-area plastic scintillator array (vi), called Outer muon Veto (OV), which vetoes the cosmic rays that do not hit the active detector region.\nThe readout system~\\cite{DCReadout} uses 500~MHz 8~bit flash ADC to keep wave forms for later detailed analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Neutrino Detection}\n\nThe reactor $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ collides with a

Detector}\n\nSince the $\\overline{\\nu}_e \\to \\overline{\\nu}_e$ disappearance probability expected was $\\sim$10~\\% or less, it was necessary to design the neutrino detector in such a way that the $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ deficit can be measured with an accuracy of $ \\sim 1 \\%$ level.\nTherefore, several techniques which significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties are employed in the Double Chooz detector. \n\n\nDouble Chooz experiment uses the underground laboratory, which was used for the Chooz experiment, for the far detector. \nThe rock overburden is $\\sim$300~meter-water equivalent. \nFig.~\\ref{fig:DC_detector} shows a schematic view of the Double Chooz detector~\\cite{DCDetector}. \n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.0

of a Gadolinium (Gd)-loaded liquid scintillator~\\cite{DCLS}, with a 10~m$^3$ volume, contained in an acrylic vessel. \nThe second liquid layer (ii) is Gd-free liquid scintillator nicknamed $\\gamma$-catcher, which detects $\\gamma$-rays escaping from the target region. \nThe light output efficiency is tuned to be the same as the neutrino target in order to reconstruct the neutrino and Gd signal energy precisely. \nThe volume is 23~m$^3$ and it is contained in the second acrylic vessel.\nThe third liquid layer (iii) is a non scintillating oil called the buffer oil, which shields the background neutrons and $\\gamma$-rays from outside and PMT glass. \nThe volume is 110~m$^3$ and it is contained in a stainless steel vessel. \n(iv) 390 10 inch low-background PMTs~\\cite{DCPMT}, which is mounted inside the stainless steel vessel, detect the scintillation lights from the neutrino target and the $\\gamma$-catcher. \nThe set of the subdetectors: (i) to (iv) defines the Inner Detector (ID).\nThe forth liquid layer (v) is another liquid scintillator, which actively vetoes the cosmic-ray background. \nIts volume is 90~m$^3$ and contained in a stainless steel vessel. This layer is named the Inner Veto (IV) and it is optically separated from the ID~\\cite{DCIV}.\nThere are 15~cm thick demagnetized iron shields outside the tank. \nFinally the whole upper part of the detector is covered by a large-area plastic scintillator array (vi), called Outer muon Veto (OV), which vetoes the cosmic rays that do not hit the active detector region.\nThe readout system~\\cite{DCReadout} uses 500~MHz 8~bit flash ADC to keep wave forms for later detailed analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Neutrino Detection}\n\nThe reactor $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ collides with a

analyses but the statistic becomes 3 times larger. \nSince the events in the Hydrogen sample are completely different from the Gd sample events and independent, the accuracy of the $\\theta_{13}$ measurement improves by combining both information. \n\n\n\\subsection{The Near-Far detectors concepts}\nThe Double Chooz experiment measures the $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ from the Chooz nuclear power station. \nThe Chooz power station has two new-generation pressurized water reactors (PWR) with a thermal power of 4.25~GW each.\nAs explained before, DC uses two detectors with the identical structure, one near the oscillation maximum (1.05~km) and the other closer to the reactors (400~m) where the oscillation is still small. \nBy comparing the data from the near and the far detectors, the systematic uncertainties of reactor neutrino flux, neutrino detection efficiency and detector mass, can be largely suppressed. \nThe two detectors are located close to the iso-flux line, on which the ratios of the squared distances to the two reactors are the same for the near and far detectors and the neutrino flux uncertainty caused by possible property differences between the two reactors are also canceled. \n\nThe far detector was completed in 2010 and has been taking data since then.\nIt was possible to measure the background directly since both reactors simultaneously turned off two times.\nThe construction of the near detector was finished in 2014.\nAt the time of this report, the near detector has taken one year of data and the physics results with both the detectors are expected to be reported within 2016. \n\n\n\n\\section{Physics Results}\n\\label{sec:Physics}\n\nAs already noted, the Double Chooz collaboration was the first one among the neutrino reactor experiments to present an indication of non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ at LowNu11 conference back to November 2011. This result was published later in 2012 in Phys. Rev. Lett.~\\cite{12DC1st}. The first results of Daya Bay and RENO experiments were also published in the same volume~\\cite{12DayaBay1st,12RENO1st}. At that time, 96.8 days of data-taking were used, leading to 4121 IBD candidates, where 4344 $\\pm$ 165 events, including backgrounds, were expected. This lack of number of events was interpreted as due to neutrino oscillations with a relatively large $\\theta_{13}$ value. The no oscillation hypothesis was excluded at the 94.6\\% C.L. Since then, many efforts and advances were performed by the collaboration to improve this result and in this section we summarize them until the current time, defining each DC data-release as: Gd-I~\\cite{12DC1st}, Gd-II~\\cite{12DCTH13}, H-II~\\cite{13DCTH13}, Gd-III~\\cite{14DCTH13IMP} and H-III~\\cite{15DCTH13}. More details on the analysis and results can be found on these references and in those cited within the next sections.\n\n\\subsection{IBD Prediction}\n\\label{sec:IBDpredic}\n\nDC, together with the current reactor neutrino experiments, uses the IBD reaction, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:ibd}), the same as the classic Cowan-Reines first observation of the neutrino. To predict the number of IBD events, all the simulation chain from the nuclear fission process in the reactor core, to the interaction in the liquids, until the event read out by the electronics is performed. At the reactor level, the MURE code, fed by the \\'Electricit\\'e de France S.A. (EdF) parameters, such as the thermal power, computes the fissile isotope composition and evolution through time~\\cite{DCReactor}. The fission rates are then used together with the measured and calculated neutrino spectra~\\cite{NuFlux} and IBD cross section to draw the neutrino energy. Then, both positron and neutron energy deposition, interaction process and light emission by the scintillator are simulated with a Geant4 based code with a custom neutron scattering model. A custom made package deals with the electronic pulse, which is the output signal from the PMTs, passing by the front-end electronics and recorded by the flash-ADC boards~\\cite{DCDetector,DCPMT,DCReadout}. The final MC information has the same format as the data and all the reconstruction (pulse, vertex position, and energy) algorithms are applied in the same way to both sets. A high precision in this prediction is sought for since in the first phase of the experiment, only the far detector is used. Finally, to avoid uncounted factors on the reactor neutrino flux (such as model imprecision and/or short-ranged oscillations), DC uses the Bugey4 mean cross-section per fission measurement as an anchor point~\\cite{Bugey4}, where the difference of the reactor fuel compositions are taken into account.\n\n\\subsection{Backgrounds}\n\\label{sec:BG}\n\t\n\n\nKnowing precisely the backgrounds involved in a neutrino detector is of importance for oscillation analysis. This is especially important in Double Chooz due to relatively shallower overburden. However, several methods to predict, measure, cross-check and veto the backgrounds were developed in DC by the analysis efforts.\n\nThe backgrounds of DC are divided in three types: accidentals, cosmogenic and correlated. Accidentals are two uncorrelated signals that pass the IBD selection (see Sec.~\\ref{sec:IBDselect}) mimicking a true neutrino signal. An example is a gamma radiation from the environment followed by a neutron, produced by spallation interaction from cosmic muons, captured a few micro-second later. Its rate is easily estimated by the combination of the prompt and delayed single signal rates. Moreover, it can be precisely measured by an off-time method, where after the prompt event, an offset time window of one second is applied to search for the delayed candidate (adding more windows for this offset increases the statistics of the method). In this way, not only the accidental rate, but its prompt signal energy spectrum is measured with high precision.\n\nWhen a muon passes through the detector's surrounding rocks, without being tagged by either the OV or IV, it can produce multiple neutrons, by spallation process, that can enter the detector. Since it is scintillator based, scatterings of protons by a neutron can produce a prompt signal, while the neutron is thermalized and might be captured also inside the detector within the coincidence time window, characterizing a correlated background. A second process of such background is the stopping-muons, since there is an acceptance hole at the detector chimney, used for source calibration, where a muon can enter, deposits an amount of energy (prompt) and stops, decaying with an electron emission (delayed). The OV and IV are powerful tools to measure the rate and energy spectra of these correlated events. While their main function is to tag muons entering the ID in an effective way, the IV is also used to get information of neutrons that also might enter the detector.\n\nThe last component of the backgrounds, the cosmogenic one, is composed of long-lived $\\beta$-n (beta-neutron) emitters. They are the isotopes $^{9}$Li, mainly, and $^{8}$He that are produced inside the ID when a high energy muon interacts with the carbon of the scintillator, or other heavy nuclei. Since they have a life-time longer than 100~milliseconds, a time veto after such muons would increase the dead-time of the detector considerably. However, fits to the time correlation between IBD candidates and the previous muon, and likelihood estimations, can be done to evaluate this background contamination.\n\n\n\n\nGiving that the DC uses only two reactors as a neutrino source, there is a good chance that both reactors stop to operate for a while. This is the perfect opportunity for a background measurement and confirmation of the background models described above. In fact, on the last four years, about seven days of data taking was performed at this configuration~\\cite{14DCBKG}, and the measured data agreed with the background models of all the data releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{IBD Candidates Selection}\n\\label{sec:IBDselect}\n\nTo select the candidates of an IBD in the recorded data, we look for positron and neutron capture event pairs correlated in time and space, which strongly suppress the backgrounds caused by single events. Thus, suitable selection cuts on energy, time difference and distance between reconstructed vertexes are applied for the event pair. The cuts depend on which type of analysis is being performed: neutron captures on Gadolinium isotopes (n-Gd, and main one) or on Hydrogen (n-H), where the main difference is on the delayed energy, defined by the gammas released after the capture. An extra cut is the multiplicity, which selects pairs that have only the prompt and the delayed event in a fixed time window, centred at the prompt event to reject multiple neutron captures. \n\n\nAdditional variables and cuts are used to further reduce the background contamination \n(described in the previous section) \n\nkeeping the maximum amount of signal as possible. These multiple vetoes can be summarized as: $\\rm F_{V}$, OV, IV, Li+He, ANN and MPS vetoes, and they are briefly described in the next paragraphs. All the IBD selection cuts and vetoes are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:SelectionComp} for all the DC data releases, where it can also be seen when new criteria were developed.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{\\small{Comparison between the IBD candidate selection method for the DC data-sets released so far.

It tells how likely an event is to be a point-like source. Stopping-$\\mu$ events in the chimney tend to show different hit pattern than a point-like source and hence $\\rm F_{V}$ becomes large for such events.\t\n\n\nOV veto (OVV) is based on the independent detector (OV) with a dedicated DAQ system. IBD candidates that are time coincident with an OV signal are rejected. \n\nIV veto (IVV) takes advantage of the fact that the IV is an active volume surrounding the ID. IV also handles good vertex and timing hit reconstruction algorithms and are examined to enhance the rejection of accidental background as explained later in this section. This information is combined with the ID to reject coincident events, since fast neutrons (fast-n) entering the detector from outside can deposit some energy in the IV before mimicking an IBD event. While in the Gd analysis only the IV information is checked for the prompt candidate, in the Hydrogen analysis both prompt and delayed IV data are examined to enhance the rejection of accidental background as explained later in this section. \n\nThe Li+He veto is based on a likelihood calculation for each prompt event and the preceding muon, that takes into account the distance of the vertex position from the muon track, reconstructed by an especially developed algorithms~\\cite{DCMuonReco}, and the number of neutron candidates following the muon within one millisecond. Prompt signals that satisfy the cut condition are rejected as cosmogenic background, where the maximum likelihood is chosen from all combinations with the preceding muon within 700 milliseconds.\n\n\n\nMultiplicity Pulse Shape (MPS) veto was designed to tag fast-n events as well. They rely on the FADCs recorded pulses to identify small energy deposits in the ID, which can be due to proton recoils before the main signal in the FADC window. \n\nRecently, the DC collaboration released a new result on the Hydrogen neutron capture analysis~\\cite{15DCTH13}, where the accidental is the main background but now highly suppressed when compared with the previous analysis and other experiments. This suppression comes from two new improvements: the first one is a multi-variable analysis based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which takes advantage on the fact that the distributions of the delayed energy and time and space correlation between prompt and delayed of the accidental events differ from the IBD ones. The second achievement is the use of the IV, as explained above, to tag environmental high energy gammas (mainly from the 206 Thallium isotope) coming from the rocks that contaminates the prompt and delayed signals in case of n-H candidates. This tagging method showed to be effective by reducing 25\\% of the accidentals after the ANN is already applied.\n\nThe power of the vetoes can be seen on the plot of Fig.~\\ref{fig:offoff2}, where they are applied to the reactor-off data, of the n-H analysis, reducing the background amount by two orders of magnitude. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{Figs/cEIDpAllvetoes.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small{Reactor off spectrum for the n-H analysis, where red points are the reject events by the vetoes and the blue points are the background events that passed all the selection criteria. A two order of magnitude of rejection power can be observed.}}\n\\label{fig:offoff2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nBesides the new methods developed, H-III also took advantage of the achievements of the Gd-III analysis methods, as seen in Table~\\ref{tab:SelectionComp} when compared with H-II. The table also shows that while all the cut windows were enlarged, many vetoes were also included, which improved the IBD detection efficiency, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:SelectionComp}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{Figs/Evis_DCII_vs_DCIII.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{Figs/EvisDel_DCII_vs_DCIII.eps}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{Figs/DT_DCII_vs_DCIII.eps}\n\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small{Comparison between the previous (Gd-II, yellow histograms) and actual (Gd-III, black circles) IBD selection methods, for the prompt (upper-left) and delayed (upper-right) energy spectra, and the time correlation (bottom center) distributions.

As the figure shows, this feature is also presented in the independent n-H sample. So far, there is no known background model that could accommodate this difference. Comparing data with the MC model of the energy response at this range, also using n-C captures and $^{12}$B decay, did not show any energy reconstruction misbehaviour as well. However, as shown in the right plot of Fig.~\\ref{fig:SpecExcess}, a correlation between the excess and the reactor power was observed, giving an evidence that the current models of reactor neutrino flux might be insufficient. Although similar results were reported by other experiments, this one from DC remains the only one published by the time of writing this paper.\n\n\nDC uses another method of oscillation analysis, the so called Reactor Rate Modulation (RRM) fit~\\cite{14DCTH13BKI}. \n\nA fit is performed comparing the predicted IBD rate with the measured one, at different reactor power regimes. It is comparable to a linear-fit, where the mixing angle is given by the slope angle and the total background rate by the intercept, i.e., where none IBD is expected. Therefore, this method is independent of spectral shape information but can still constrain the background rate in the fit. In addition, the RRM fit is robust against the spectrum distortion with a constraint from the Bugey4 measurement.\n\n\nThe left plot of Fig.~\\ref{fig:RRMfit} shows this method used to fit both the n-Gd and n-H samples simultaneously, which gives \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 45457, "prevtext": " \nas the delayed signals in addition to the Gd signals.\nFor those analyses, the systematic uncertainty is slightly worse than the Gd analyses but the statistic becomes 3 times larger. \nSince the events in the Hydrogen sample are completely different from the Gd sample events and independent, the accuracy of the $\\theta_{13}$ measurement improves by combining both information. \n\n\n\\subsection{The Near-Far detectors concepts}\nThe Double Chooz experiment measures the $\\overline{\\nu}_e$ from the Chooz nuclear power station. \nThe Chooz power station has two new-generation pressurized water reactors (PWR) with a thermal power of 4.25~GW each.\nAs explained before, DC uses two detectors with the identical structure, one near the oscillation maximum (1.05~km) and the other closer to the reactors (400~m) where the oscillation is still small. \nBy comparing the data from the near and the far detectors, the systematic uncertainties of reactor neutrino flux, neutrino detection efficiency and detector mass, can be largely suppressed. \nThe two detectors are located close to the iso-flux line, on which the ratios of the squared distances to the two reactors are the same for the near and far detectors and the neutrino flux uncertainty caused by possible property differences between the two reactors are also canceled. \n\nThe far detector was completed in 2010 and has been taking data since then.\nIt was possible to measure the background directly since both reactors simultaneously turned off two times.\nThe construction of the near detector was finished in 2014.\nAt the time of this report, the near detector has taken one year of data and the physics results with both the detectors are expected to be reported within 2016. \n\n\n\n\\section{Physics Results}\n\\label{sec:Physics}\n\nAs already noted, the Double Chooz collaboration was the first one among the neutrino reactor experiments to present an indication of non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ at LowNu11 conference back to November 2011. This result was published later in 2012 in Phys. Rev. Lett.~\\cite{12DC1st}. The first results of Daya Bay and RENO experiments were also published in the same volume~\\cite{12DayaBay1st,12RENO1st}. At that time, 96.8 days of data-taking were used, leading to 4121 IBD candidates, where 4344 $\\pm$ 165 events, including backgrounds, were expected. This lack of number of events was interpreted as due to neutrino oscillations with a relatively large $\\theta_{13}$ value. The no oscillation hypothesis was excluded at the 94.6\\% C.L. Since then, many efforts and advances were performed by the collaboration to improve this result and in this section we summarize them until the current time, defining each DC data-release as: Gd-I~\\cite{12DC1st}, Gd-II~\\cite{12DCTH13}, H-II~\\cite{13DCTH13}, Gd-III~\\cite{14DCTH13IMP} and H-III~\\cite{15DCTH13}. More details on the analysis and results can be found on these references and in those cited within the next sections.\n\n\\subsection{IBD Prediction}\n\\label{sec:IBDpredic}\n\nDC, together with the current reactor neutrino experiments, uses the IBD reaction, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:ibd}), the same as the classic Cowan-Reines first observation of the neutrino. To predict the number of IBD events, all the simulation chain from the nuclear fission process in the reactor core, to the interaction in the liquids, until the event read out by the electronics is performed. At the reactor level, the MURE code, fed by the \\'Electricit\\'e de France S.A. (EdF) parameters, such as the thermal power, computes the fissile isotope composition and evolution through time~\\cite{DCReactor}. The fission rates are then used together with the measured and calculated neutrino spectra~\\cite{NuFlux} and IBD cross section to draw the neutrino energy. Then, both positron and neutron energy deposition, interaction process and light emission by the scintillator are simulated with a Geant4 based code with a custom neutron scattering model. A custom made package deals with the electronic pulse, which is the output signal from the PMTs, passing by the front-end electronics and recorded by the flash-ADC boards~\\cite{DCDetector,DCPMT,DCReadout}. The final MC information has the same format as the data and all the reconstruction (pulse, vertex position, and energy) algorithms are applied in the same way to both sets. A high precision in this prediction is sought for since in the first phase of the experiment, only the far detector is used. Finally, to avoid uncounted factors on the reactor neutrino flux (such as model imprecision and/or short-ranged oscillations), DC uses the Bugey4 mean cross-section per fission measurement as an anchor point~\\cite{Bugey4}, where the difference of the reactor fuel compositions are taken into account.\n\n\\subsection{Backgrounds}\n\\label{sec:BG}\n\t\n\n\nKnowing precisely the backgrounds involved in a neutrino detector is of importance for oscillation analysis. This is especially important in Double Chooz due to relatively shallower overburden. However, several methods to predict, measure, cross-check and veto the backgrounds were developed in DC by the analysis efforts.\n\nThe backgrounds of DC are divided in three types: accidentals, cosmogenic and correlated. Accidentals are two uncorrelated signals that pass the IBD selection (see Sec.~\\ref{sec:IBDselect}) mimicking a true neutrino signal. An example is a gamma radiation from the environment followed by a neutron, produced by spallation interaction from cosmic muons, captured a few micro-second later. Its rate is easily estimated by the combination of the prompt and delayed single signal rates. Moreover, it can be precisely measured by an off-time method, where after the prompt event, an offset time window of one second is applied to search for the delayed candidate (adding more windows for this offset increases the statistics of the method). In this way, not only the accidental rate, but its prompt signal energy spectrum is measured with high precision.\n\nWhen a muon passes through the detector's surrounding rocks, without being tagged by either the OV or IV, it can produce multiple neutrons, by spallation process, that can enter the detector. Since it is scintillator based, scatterings of protons by a neutron can produce a prompt signal, while the neutron is thermalized and might be captured also inside the detector within the coincidence time window, characterizing a correlated background. A second process of such background is the stopping-muons, since there is an acceptance hole at the detector chimney, used for source calibration, where a muon can enter, deposits an amount of energy (prompt) and stops, decaying with an electron emission (delayed). The OV and IV are powerful tools to measure the rate and energy spectra of these correlated events. While their main function is to tag muons entering the ID in an effective way, the IV is also used to get information of neutrons that also might enter the detector.\n\nThe last component of the backgrounds, the cosmogenic one, is composed of long-lived $\\beta$-n (beta-neutron) emitters. They are the isotopes $^{9}$Li, mainly, and $^{8}$He that are produced inside the ID when a high energy muon interacts with the carbon of the scintillator, or other heavy nuclei. Since they have a life-time longer than 100~milliseconds, a time veto after such muons would increase the dead-time of the detector considerably. However, fits to the time correlation between IBD candidates and the previous muon, and likelihood estimations, can be done to evaluate this background contamination.\n\n\n\n\nGiving that the DC uses only two reactors as a neutrino source, there is a good chance that both reactors stop to operate for a while. This is the perfect opportunity for a background measurement and confirmation of the background models described above. In fact, on the last four years, about seven days of data taking was performed at this configuration~\\cite{14DCBKG}, and the measured data agreed with the background models of all the data releases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{IBD Candidates Selection}\n\\label{sec:IBDselect}\n\nTo select the candidates of an IBD in the recorded data, we look for positron and neutron capture event pairs correlated in time and space, which strongly suppress the backgrounds caused by single events. Thus, suitable selection cuts on energy, time difference and distance between reconstructed vertexes are applied for the event pair. The cuts depend on which type of analysis is being performed: neutron captures on Gadolinium isotopes (n-Gd, and main one) or on Hydrogen (n-H), where the main difference is on the delayed energy, defined by the gammas released after the capture. An extra cut is the multiplicity, which selects pairs that have only the prompt and the delayed event in a fixed time window, centred at the prompt event to reject multiple neutron captures. \n\n\nAdditional variables and cuts are used to further reduce the background contamination \n(described in the previous section) \n\nkeeping the maximum amount of signal as possible. These multiple vetoes can be summarized as: $\\rm F_{V}$, OV, IV, Li+He, ANN and MPS vetoes, and they are briefly described in the next paragraphs. All the IBD selection cuts and vetoes are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:SelectionComp} for all the DC data releases, where it can also be seen when new criteria were developed.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{\\small{Comparison between the IBD candidate selection method for the DC data-sets released so far.

It tells how likely an event is to be a point-like source. Stopping-$\\mu$ events in the chimney tend to show different hit pattern than a point-like source and hence $\\rm F_{V}$ becomes large for such events.\t\n\n\nOV veto (OVV) is based on the independent detector (OV) with a dedicated DAQ system. IBD candidates that are time coincident with an OV signal are rejected. \n\nIV veto (IVV) takes advantage of the fact that the IV is an active volume surrounding the ID. IV also handles good vertex and timing hit reconstruction algorithms and are examined to enhance the rejection of accidental background as explained later in this section. This information is combined with the ID to reject coincident events, since fast neutrons (fast-n) entering the detector from outside can deposit some energy in the IV before mimicking an IBD event. While in the Gd analysis only the IV information is checked for the prompt candidate, in the Hydrogen analysis both prompt and delayed IV data are examined to enhance the rejection of accidental background as explained later in this section. \n\nThe Li+He veto is based on a likelihood calculation for each prompt event and the preceding muon, that takes into account the distance of the vertex position from the muon track, reconstructed by an especially developed algorithms~\\cite{DCMuonReco}, and the number of neutron candidates following the muon within one millisecond. Prompt signals that satisfy the cut condition are rejected as cosmogenic background, where the maximum likelihood is chosen from all combinations with the preceding muon within 700 milliseconds.\n\n\n\nMultiplicity Pulse Shape (MPS) veto was designed to tag fast-n events as well. They rely on the FADCs recorded pulses to identify small energy deposits in the ID, which can be due to proton recoils before the main signal in the FADC window. \n\nRecently, the DC collaboration released a new result on the Hydrogen neutron capture analysis~\\cite{15DCTH13}, where the accidental is the main background but now highly suppressed when compared with the previous analysis and other experiments. This suppression comes from two new improvements: the first one is a multi-variable analysis based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which takes advantage on the fact that the distributions of the delayed energy and time and space correlation between prompt and delayed of the accidental events differ from the IBD ones. The second achievement is the use of the IV, as explained above, to tag environmental high energy gammas (mainly from the 206 Thallium isotope) coming from the rocks that contaminates the prompt and delayed signals in case of n-H candidates. This tagging method showed to be effective by reducing 25\\% of the accidentals after the ANN is already applied.\n\nThe power of the vetoes can be seen on the plot of Fig.~\\ref{fig:offoff2}, where they are applied to the reactor-off data, of the n-H analysis, reducing the background amount by two orders of magnitude. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{Figs/cEIDpAllvetoes.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small{Reactor off spectrum for the n-H analysis, where red points are the reject events by the vetoes and the blue points are the background events that passed all the selection criteria. A two order of magnitude of rejection power can be observed.}}\n\\label{fig:offoff2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nBesides the new methods developed, H-III also took advantage of the achievements of the Gd-III analysis methods, as seen in Table~\\ref{tab:SelectionComp} when compared with H-II. The table also shows that while all the cut windows were enlarged, many vetoes were also included, which improved the IBD detection efficiency, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:SelectionComp}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{Figs/Evis_DCII_vs_DCIII.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{Figs/EvisDel_DCII_vs_DCIII.eps}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{Figs/DT_DCII_vs_DCIII.eps}\n\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small{Comparison between the previous (Gd-II, yellow histograms) and actual (Gd-III, black circles) IBD selection methods, for the prompt (upper-left) and delayed (upper-right) energy spectra, and the time correlation (bottom center) distributions.

On Table~\\ref{tab:FitUnc}, while the first two lines are expected to vanish almost completely, the background uncertainties, dominant in the new phase, will decrease as well, since its measurement is based on the statistics of the data accumulation.\n\nFinally, besides works on neutrino oscillation, the DC collaboration also released many other interesting physics analysis, such as a test of Lorentz violation~\\cite{12DCLo}, ortho-positronium observation~\\cite{14DCPs}, and muon capture on light isotopes~\\cite{15DCMuCap}.\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\\label{sec:Summary}\nThe reactor measurement of $\\theta_{13}$ is a very important part of the neutrino oscillation studies. \nDouble Chooz initiated the field from the era of the Chooz experiment. \nIt showed the first indication of the reactor neutrino deficit at a baseline $\\sim $1~km and is measuring $\\theta_{13}$ using high quality data and analysis techniques. \nIn the near future, it will present a precise $\\theta_{13}$ using the near+far detector data. \nThe high precision $\\theta_{13}$ value measured by reactor experiments will become an indispensable piece of information in the next decades when the mass hierarchy and leptonic CP violation are to be measured and insights into the nature are expected to be deepened. \n\n\n\\section*{Aqunowledgements}\nThe Double Chooz group thanks the French electricity company EDF; \nthe European fund FEDER; \nthe R\\'{e}gion de Champagne Ardenne; the D\\'{e}partement des Ardennes; \nand the Communaut\\'{e} de Communes Ardenne Rives de Meuse. \nThe Double Chooz group acknowledges the support of the CEA, CNRS/IN2P3, \nthe computer centre CCIN2P3, and LabEx UnivEarthS in France (ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02); \nthe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT) and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS); \nthe Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation of the United States; \nU.S. Department of Energy Award DE-NA0000979 through the Nuclear Science and Security Consortium; \nthe Ministerio de Econom\\'{i}a y Competitividad (MINECO) of Spain; the Max Planck Gesellschaft, and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG, the Transregional Collaborative Research Center TR27, the excellence cluster \u0081gOrigin and Structure of the Universe\u0081h, and the Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium Garching in Germany; the Russian Academy of Science, the Kurchatov Institute and RFBR (the Russian Foundation for Basic Research); the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI), the Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\\'{i}fico e Tecnol\\'{o}gico (CNPq), the S\\~{a}o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), and the Brazilian Network for High Energy Physics (RENAFAE) in Brazil.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{00} \n\n\\bibitem{98SK} Super-Kamiokande Collaboration, Phys.

As the figure shows, this feature is also presented in the independent n-H sample. So far, there is no known background model that could accommodate this difference. Comparing data with the MC model of the energy response at this range, also using n-C captures and $^{12}$B decay, did not show any energy reconstruction misbehaviour as well. However, as shown in the right plot of Fig.~\\ref{fig:SpecExcess}, a correlation between the excess and the reactor power was observed, giving an evidence that the current models of reactor neutrino flux might be insufficient. Although similar results were reported by other experiments, this one from DC remains the only one published by the time of writing this paper.\n\n\nDC uses another method of oscillation analysis, the so called Reactor Rate Modulation (RRM) fit~\\cite{14DCTH13BKI}. \n\nA fit is performed comparing the predicted IBD rate with the measured one, at different reactor power regimes. It is comparable to a linear-fit, where the mixing angle is given by the slope angle and the total background rate by the intercept, i.e., where none IBD is expected. Therefore, this method is independent of spectral shape information but can still constrain the background rate in the fit. In addition, the RRM fit is robust against the spectrum distortion with a constraint from the Bugey4 measurement.\n\n\nThe left plot of Fig.~\\ref{fig:RRMfit} shows this method used to fit both the n-Gd and n-H samples simultaneously, which gives \n\n", "index": 45, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\sin^22\\theta_{13} = 0.088 \\pm 0.033.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E23.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\sin^{2}2\\theta_{13}=0.088\\pm 0.033.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mn>13</mn></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>0.088</mn><mo>\u00b1</mo><mn>0.033</mn></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
