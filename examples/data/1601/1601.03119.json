applications in photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and photodetection. \nOne  limitation is that many metallic nanostructures support a single plasmon resonance thus restricting the light-to-charge-carrier activity to a spectral band. \nHere we demonstrate that a monolayer of plasmonic nanoparticles can be assembled on a multi\u00e2\u0080\u0093stack layered configuration to achieve broad-band, near-unit light absorption, which is spatially localised on the nanoparticle layer. \nWe show that this enhanced light absorbance leads to $\\sim$ 40--fold increases in the photon--to--electron conversion efficiency by the plasmonic nanostructures. \nWe developed a model that successfully captures the essential physics of the plasmonic hot--electron charge generation and separation in these structures. \nThis model  also allowed us to   establish that efficient hot carrier extraction is limited to spectral regions where the photons possessing energies higher than the Schottky junctions and the localised light absorption of the metal nanoparticles overlap.\n}\n\n\n\nMetal nanoparticles exhibit absorption cross-sections for incident light that can far exceed their physical dimensions. \nThis strong interaction with light originates from the excitation of collective oscillations of surface charges in the nanoparticles, commonly referred to as surface plasmons. \nPlasmons can relax radiatively by re-emitting photons or non-radiatively creating a transient population of non-equilibrium (hot) charge-carriers \\cite{Clavero_NP2014a,Brongersma_NN2015a,Linic_NM2011a}, which in a chemically inert environment, transfer their energy to the metal lattice resulting in nanoparticle heating \\cite{Hartland_CR2011a}. \n \nHowever, it is also possible for these hot charge carriers to be deposited into acceptor states of adsorbates \\cite{Kale_AC2014a} or to be transferred to an accepting medium creating charge--separated states with sufficient chemical potential energy to drive chemical (redox) reactions.\nFor instance, in metal-semiconductor Schottky junctions, plasmon relaxation can result in the emission of  hot charge carriers into the conduction band of the semiconductor\\cite{Furube_JOTACS2007a}, a charge--separation process that requires photon energies below the band gap energy of the semiconductors and which has been used in photovoltaics \\cite{Mubeen_AN2014a}, photodetection \\cite{Knight_S2011a} and photocatalysis  \\cite{Nishijima_TJOPCL2012a,Tian_JOTACS2005a}.\nPlasmonic hot charge--carrier generation  has recently been used for the light-driven \ndissociation of hydrogen\\cite{Mukherjee_NL2013a,Mukherjee_JOTACS2014a}, \noxidation of ethylene\\cite{Christopher_NC2011a},\ncross--coupling reactions\\cite{Xiao_AC2014a}, \nreduction of nitro--aromatics to azo compounds \\cite{Ke_GC2013a} \nand other reactions involving more complex organic molecules\\cite{Wang_CSR2014a,Scaiano_TJOPCL2013a,Xiao_JMCA2013a}. \n\n\n\nThe plasmon hot--carrier relaxation pathway is a process that depends on \\cite{Moskovits_NN2015a}: \n(i) the efficiency of the charge transfer  that must take place at relevant interfaces, \n(ii) the charge separation following light absorption and \n(iii) the absorption of incident photons.\nTherefore, it is expected that the rate of plasmonic hot--charge carrier relaxation can be substantially increased under conditions where the metal nanostructures absorb nearly all incident photons across a broad spectral bandwidth\\cite{Fang_NL2015a,Robatjazi_NL2015a}. \nTypically, near unit broadband absorption has been achieved with metal-insulator-metal (MIM)  structures\\cite{Liu_AAMI2015a,Aydin_NC2011a,Hedayati_AM2011a,Landy_PRL2008a}.\nThese  consist of a thin insulator or dielectric layer ($<$ 100 nm) sandwiched between a  metal mirror and a thin top layer of light absorbing metal nanostructures. \nBy replacing the insulator layer in an MIM structure with a semiconductor such as TiO$_2$, it should be possible to extract plasmonic hot--carriers using a  Schottky junction that exhibits near unit broadband absorption \\cite{Fang_NL2015a}. \nIn addition to the expected increases in hot--carrier generation efficiencies,  near--unit broadband absorption is an ideal model system to study the mechanism  of photo--conversion in plasmonic structures.\n\nHere  we present a study on  the extraction of plasmonic hot charge carriers from a monolayer of Au nanoparticles capable of absorbing up to $>$ 90\\% of incident visible light in a metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) configuration.\nExaminations of the photoelectrochemical behaviour of such structures reveal significant enhancements in the yields of hot carrier extraction.\nFurthermore,  with the aid of a simple phenomenological model, we establish that\nplasmon non--radiative relaxation yields uniform energy and momentum distributions of the generated charge carriers, which  limit the spectral bandwidth of  hot carrier extraction.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[tbph!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{figures/Fig1}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Architecture and working principle of plasmonic broadband absorber

\\textit{a single layer} of Au nanoparticles, separated by a thin TiO$_2$ layer. \nThese samples were made by means of sequential physical vapour deposition of materials (see Methods section),  a large scale method  resulting in a densely--packed monolayer of Au nanoparticles \n[shown in  the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of Figure 2a: 10 nm thick, average diameter of 20 nm, dimensions that are $\\le$ mean-free path for hot electrons in Au\\cite{McFarland_N2003a}. Size histogram in  Supplementary figure S1].\nThis nanoparticle ensemble, when deposited on top of glass--supported TiO$_2$ films,  exhibits a single--band absorption centred around 620 nm (with 0.15 absorbance) characteristic of  localised surface plasmon resonances of Au nanoparticles on materials with a high refractive index \\cite{Tian_JOTACS2005a}.\nOn the contrary, the metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle structure (Au\\textunderscore50nmTiO2\\textunderscore AuNP) exhibits a distinctively broadband absorption in a spectral region ranging from 600 nm to 1000 nm, reaching absorbance values of up to $\\sim$0.75: a 5-fold increase in absorbance, when compared to the control sample without the reflecting layer (50nmTiO2\\textunderscore AuNP).\nThese absorption spectra were calculated as $A=1-R-T$, where $R$ and $T$ correspond to measured reflectance and transmission spectra (both their diffuse and specular components, see Methods section).\n\n\nIn the metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle structures, the thickness of the TiO$_2$ layer was chosen, with the aid of  numerical solutions of Maxwell equations (see supporting information section \\ref{sec:S1}) such that the structure exhibited low reflection (R) of light in the visible. \nGiven that the thickness of the  supporting metal layer is much greater than the skin depth of the metal, there is no transmission of light in these structures (T = 0) and conservation of energy dictates that the absorbance A is therefore given by A = 1 - R, implying that (near) unit absorption occurs when R (tends to) equals zero. \n\nNear--unit absorption in these structures originates from optical destructive interference between directly reflected light and the multiple reflections taking place at the other interfaces of the multi--layer stack \\cite{Chen_OE2012a} (see diagram of figure 1A).\nOther interpretations assign the near--unit absorption of light to a renormalization of the polarizability of the nanoparticles due to their interactions with the mirror \\cite{Kwadrin_A2015a} or to optical impedance matching between the structure and free space, a phenomenon that occurs due to a magnetic response  that arises from anti\u00e2\u0080\u0093-parallel currents taking place on both the metal mirror and the nanoparticles \\cite{Liu_AAMI2015a,Aydin_NC2011a,Hedayati_AM2011a,Landy_PRL2008a}. \nAccording to the numerical simulations shown in Figure 1C, at a wavelength of 650 nm there is a strong (and sub--wavelength) localisation of the electric field at the spatial location of the metal nanoparticles, which accounts for the high absorbance reported in Figure 1B.\n\nAs a function of the incident photon wavelength, Figure 1D shows that the spatial location of the absorption occurs  at the nanoparticle monolayer for long wavelengths, but it becomes localised on the metal mirror at shorter wavelengths.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbph!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{figures/Fig2}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Photoelectrochemical and absorption performance of the plasmonic broadband absorber structure}.\n(A) Illustration of the working principle: Upon visible light illumination and plasmon non--radiative relaxation, hot electrons in the Au nanoparticles can be injected to TiO$_2$ and be transported subsequently to the Pt counter electrode and measured as photocurrents.

non--radiative relaxation of nanoparticle plasmons can result in the transfer of the incident photon energy to a hot electron, which can obtain sufficient energy and momentum to overcome the Schottky barrier existent at the Au nanoparticle--TiO$_2$ interface \\cite{Mubeen_NL2011a}.\nTo measure this possible photon--to--electron conversion, we employed  the metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle structures as photoanodes in photo--electrochemical cells, as illustrated in the diagram of figure 2A \\cite{Thomann_NL2011a,Tian_CC2004a,Garcia-de-Arquer_AN2013a}. \nElectron injection  from the metal nanoparticles into accepting states (such as the conduction band or trap states) of the TiO$_2$ film, leaves a  positive charge (hole) on the Au nanoparticles which can be neutralised by electron donating species in solution.  \nInjected electrons in the TiO$_2$ can then be collected by the mirror (which also acts as an electrical contact) and transported to a Pt counter electrode, where reduction reactions take place. \nThe overall process results in the generation of measurable photocurrents.\n\nFigure 2B shows the measured photocurrents for three photoanodes:\n(i)  metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle  (Au\\textunderscore 50nmTiO2\\textunderscore AuNP), \n(ii) metal--supported TiO$_2$ thin film (Au\\textunderscore 50nmTiO2), \n and \n(iii) a semiconductor--supported Au nanoparticle monolayer (50nmTiO2\\textunderscore AuNP).\nThese measurements were performed under visible light irradiation (495 nm long pass filter) in a two-electrode configuration with an applied potential of 0.5 V,\nand under conditions where the electrolyte consisted of aqueous 0.5 M Na$_2$SO$_4$ with 20 v/v\\% methanol (purged with N$_2$, more details can be found in the methods section). \n\nThe long-pass filter  eliminates possible  direct excitation of electron--hole pairs in TiO$_2$ with photon energies above its band gap (see Supplementary figure S2 where we estimate the band-gap of the TiO$_2$). \nIndeed, significant photocurrents at wavelengths higher than 495 nm were only observed when Au nanoparticles were present on the electrodes. \nThe photocurrents observed in figure 2B can only be a consequence of the excitation and extraction of hot charge--carriers from the Au nanoparticles into the Pt counter electrode. \nThese photocurrents were detected only when the visible light was turned on and the currents returned to the background in the dark. \nThis confirms that the measured electrical currents were photo--induced, as opposed to dark (thermal) currents enhanced by the applied bias voltage [see figure S4 where the effect of the applied bias on the measured photocurrents is reported]. \nThe measurements were reproducible and stable for all of the samples, indicating the absence of  irreversible electrochemical damage to the photoanodes. \n The  anodic currents measured with the metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle sample (0.56 $\\mu$A cm$^{-2}$) were 3.5 times larger than those obtained with the semiconductor--supported Au nanoparticle monolayer (0.16 $\\mu$A cm$^{-2}$) electrode. \nThe magnitude of these photocurrents increased linearly with the incident illumination power and illumination leads to a change in the measured photovoltage (see Supplementary figures S3 and S5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE)}.\nThe IPCE as a function of wavelength was measured for all three samples, and the results are shown in figure 2C. \nThe metal--supported TiO$_2$ thin film (Au\\textunderscore 50nmTiO2)  did not lead to an appreciable IPCE even though it showed a relatively high absorption at 460 nm. \nOn the contrary, the non-vanishing IPCE spectrum measured for the semiconductor--supported Au nanoparticle monolayer (50nmTiO2\\textunderscore AuNP) closely follows the lineshape of its corresponding optical absorption spectrum shown in figure 1B, indicating a strong correlation with the photoexcitation of localised surface plasmon resonances. \nFor the metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle photo--anode (Au\\textunderscore 50nmTiO2\\textunderscore AuNP), the measured IPCE has a broadband character with a maximum of 0.27 \\% at around 600 nm, an efficiency $\\sim$ 20 times larger than the one measured for the semiconductor--supported Au nanoparticle monolayer (50nmTiO2\\textunderscore AuNP).\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbph!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{figures/Fig3}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Effect of structural parameters on measured IPCE.} \n(A)\\textit{TiO$_2$

from Landau damping of plasmons.\nLittle is known at present about these  energy--momentum distributions.\n\nTo get an estimate of $\\eta_{inj}$, we assume that Landau damping produces an isotropic momentum distribution \\cite{Scales_QEIJO2010a} and approximate the energy distribution of hot--electrons as a product of the initial and final (parabolic) density of electron states in the metal.\nWe furthermore consider the initial states to have energies  ranging from below (and up to) the Fermi level $E_F$, whereas the final states are thought to have energies   from the Fermi level and up to  $E_F$ + the incident photon energy \\cite{White_APL2012a}.\n$\\eta_{inj}$ is then approximated as  $P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB}|k_e)\\otimes\\langle T\\rangle$ [see equation \\eqref{eq:S_eta_inj}], where: \n$\\langle T\\rangle$ is the transmission coefficient for electrons across the metal nanoparticle--semiconductor interface (calculated taking into account conservation of momentum, see section \\ref{sec:S_T})\nand,\n$P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB}|k_e)$ is the  fraction of the   hot--electron population for which the electrons have  a momentum $k_e$ that lies within the escape cone of the metal--semiconductor interface and \nwith energies $E_e$ above the Schottky barrier [see equation \\eqref{eq:S_momentum}].\nAs shown in figure 3A,  $\\eta_{inj}$ increases  slowly with incident photon energy\n[details of the calculations leading to figure \\ref{fig:Fig4}(A) are shown in the supplementary section S3, note that we do not consider possible quantum mechanical tunnelling of electrons under the barrier].\n\n\n\nThe charge--carrier transport efficiency $\\eta_\\text{trpt}$ is the probability that, after injection, the charge carrier is transported    through the TiO$_2$ layer, without experiencing  scattering and/or trapping at defect states, the probability of which we assume to be determined by the ratio of the thickness of the metal--oxide layer  and the  mean--free path for electrons\\cite{Seah_SAIA1979a} (see section \\ref{sec:eta_trpt}).\n$\\eta_{injm}$, is approximated by the transmission coefficient for  electrons to traverse the semiconductor--metal (reflector) interface, thus accounting for possible reflections \ndue to the momentum and energy mismatch  \n(more details in section \\ref{sec:S_eta_injm}). \nFor simplicity, we do not account for possible electron flow from the metal reflector into the semiconductor, which may originate from the excitation and decay of surface plasmon polaritons at the metal/semiconductor interface.\nThis charge flow will have an opposite direction and thus decrease the measured photocurrents and IPCE \\cite{Chalabi_NL2014a, Wang_NL2011a}.\n\nThe calculated values of $\\eta$ (assuming $\\eta_{ed}=1$) and \n$A_{layer}\\times\\eta$ produce the dotted and continuous lines in Figure \\ref{fig:Fig4}B respectively.\n$\\eta$  is strongly dependent on the magnitude of $\\Phi_{SB}$, the thickness of the oxide layer and the height of the energy barrier preventing electron injection at the semiconductor--mirror interface.\nThe model satisfactorily reproduces the slow increase of the measured IPCE with incident photon energy, in particular, for a value of $\\Phi_{SB}$ = 1.20 eV reported by the experiments of Lee {\\it et al} \\cite{Lee_NL2011a} \n\n\n\nIn the model, this curvature originates from a combination of two factors:\n(i) the almost rectangular  shape of the energy distribution of hot carriers, which  limits the number of these carriers that meets the energy requirements for injection [i.e. $E>\\Phi_{SB}$, see curve $P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB})$ of fig. 4A] and,\n(ii) the narrow escape cone for carriers from the metal nanoparticles and into the semiconductor, which  severely limits the total fraction of ``useful'' charge carriers by almost 75\\% [see figure S9(B)].\nFactor (i) is a consequence of the assumed broad energy distribution of initial states, whereas (ii) originates from the assumed uniform distribution of electron momenta resulting from Landau damping.\n\nAt higher energies, the calculated drop in $A_{layer}\\times\\eta$ is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results, which is a consequence of the fact that at these wavelengths, light is predominantly absorbed by the mirror (see figure 1D).\nA simple conclusion that can be drawn from these observations is that, in spite of the spectrally broad and strong absorption of light achievable with the metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle structure, the generation of charge--carriers from plasmon relaxation in this architecture is limited to those spectral regions where  the incident  photon energies are  in excess of  the metal--semiconductor Schottky barrier and below the onset for strong absorption by the metal reflecting layer.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbph!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{SI/Fig_theory4}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Narrow distribution of states near the Fermi level of

that can be modelled by considering that the bottom of the conduction band is close ($\\sim$ 0.15 eV) to the Fermi level of the metal \\cite{Chan_QEIJO1980a, White_APL2012a}, a hypothetical (and somewhat unrealistic) situation depicted in \nfigure \\ref{fig:5}.\nThe orange curve in fig. \\ref{fig:5}(A) shows that for this hypothetical case, the fraction of the population of hot--electrons with $E_e>\\Phi_{SB}$ is almost a step function of the incident photon energy and becomes energy--independent (and unit) for energies slightly above $\\Phi_{SB}$.\nThis step--like $P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB})$ drastically changes the shape of $\\eta$ [fig. \\ref{fig:5}(B)] and leads to an overall increase in the expected internal efficiency\n\n\nThe measured IPCEs are  well below the predictions of our model, which were made under the assumption of unit $\\eta_{ed}$.\n$\\eta_{ed}$ in the photo--electrochemical configuration that we adopted for extracting hot--charge carriers is\nexpected to be limited by the kinetics of charge and mass transfer occurring at the solid--liquid interfaces.\nIn figure 4C we show the measured IPCE changes for a sample where the (sacrificial) electron donating species were changed from Methanol  (MeOH) to Ethanol (EtOH) and to Isopropanol (IPA).\nAn uniform increase in the IPCE is clearly observable for the case of EtOH, which is attributable solely to changes in the kinetic and thermodynamic processes taking place at the photoanode/liquid junction.\n\n$\\eta_{ed}$ is a parameter which is not included in our theoretical description of plasmonic hot--charge carrier extraction, but which seems to play a key role in determining the IPCE in our photo--electrochemical cell, an observation also conjectured in (solid state) plasmonic solar cells\\cite{Reineck_AM2012a}, where it was found that hole accumulation at the metal nanoparticles limits device performance.\n\n\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the extraction of plasmonic--derived charge carriers from a multi--layer stack comprising a monolayer of Au nanoparticles.\nThese multilayer structures exhibit broadband and intense \n\nabsorption of light, which leads to a significant increase in the incident photon--to--electron conversion efficiencies.  \nWe have developed a simple model to describe the hot--charge carrier generation and transport in this system, which satisfactorily describes the measured IPCE spectra.\nAccording to this  model, the broad distribution of hot--charge carrier energies and their uniform distribution of momenta, account for the weak increase in measured IPCE with  incident  photon energies.\n\nA more efficient strategy for generating and extracting plasmonic hot charge carriers is one that combines strong near--unit absorption of light with a mechanism, such as the plasmon-induced metal-to-semiconductor interfacial charge transfer transition, where a quantum yield for electron injection of $>$24\\% has been found to be  independent of the incident photon energy \\cite{Wu_S2015a}. \nOur results demonstrate that significant enhancements in\nthe efficiencies of opto--electronic and photoelectrochemical devices that operate with plasmonic--derived hot--charge carriers can be achieved by tailoring the optical properties of the plasmonic nanostructures.\n\n\\textbf{Methods}\n\n{\\footnotesize  \n\n\\textbf{Material fabrication and Characterization}\nThe Al and Au  mirrors were deposited onto glass substrates with an in--house constructed electron beam evaporator equipped with transmittance monitoring. \nA thin layer of Cr was deposited prior to the Au deposition to ensure good adhesion to the glass substrate. \nFor both Al and Au mirrors, deposition was conducted by monitoring the optical transmittance  to ensure the films had no transmittance of light. \nSubsequently, the TiO$_2$ layers (30 nm and 50 nm) were deposited onto the metal supporting mirrors through an ion--assisted electron beam evaporation process at 200$^\\circ$C. \nThe bombardment of oxygen during the deposition process ensured the deposition of stoichiometric TiO$_2$ onto the mirrors.  \nLastly, the Au nanoparticles were deposited with a similar electron beam evaporation process with two types of in--situ optical monitoring. \nA broadband transmittance was utilized to monitor the absorption of the Au nanoparticles, while an ellipsometry measurement at 633 nm was employed to achieve non--overlapping particles and detect the deposition point at which  the particles coagulate to form continuous films. \nScanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the Au NPs were obtained with a Zeiss Merlin Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope. \nThe diffuse and specular reflectance ($R$) and  transmittance ($T$) spectra were measured using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 1050) with an integrating sphere and small spot kit. \nWith these two measurements, the absorbance was calculated as $A = 1 - R - T$. \n\n\\textbf{Photoelectrochemical measurements}\nThe designed structure and platinum wire was employed as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively in a 2 electrode system. \nThe exposed surface area of the working electrode was 1 cm in diameter. \nThe electrolyte solution used was 0.5 M Na$_2$SO$_4$ (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich, $\\ge$99\\%) with 20 v/v \\% amount of methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, $\\ge$99.9\\%) or ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, $\\ge$99.9\\%) as the sacrificial reagent.\n The 0.5 M Na$_2$SO$_4$ was employed to reduce the resistance in the electrolyte solution. \n Prior to the photocurrent measurements, the solutions were purged with N$_2$ gas to remove  electron scavenging O$_2$. \n The working potential was set at +0.5 V versus the Pt wire and the devices were illuminated with light from a 300 W Xenon lamp (Newport Model no. 669092) using a $\\ge$ 495 nm cut-off filter (Thorlabs FGL-495). \n The applied voltage and photocurrent $I$ were recorded with a potentiostat (AutoLab PGSTAT204). \n To measure the IPCE values, light from the Xenon lamp was coupled to a monochromator with a bandwidth of 5 nm at full width at half maximum (FWHM). \n The light intensity $P$ of the monochromatic light at each wavelength was measured using a Thorlabs optical power and energy meter (Model. PM100D). \n The incident photon to electron efficiency (IPCE) was calculated by the following formula: \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 21567, "prevtext": "\nThe former can be determined by solving Maxwell's equations for the structures, which also provide information on, for instance,  the spectral and spatial location of the light-absorption events (e.g. figure 1D). \n $A_{layer}$  is

"\nwhich conceptually \nresults from the following sequence of  events (see the diagram shown in figure 2): \n \t(i) the  injection of a plasmon--derived hot electron across the nanoparticle--semiconductor Schottky barrier, with probability  $\\eta_{inj}$ ,\n \t(ii) elastic transport of the injected electrons across the semiconductor layer with an associated probability $\\eta_{trpt}$, \n \t(iii) the injection of the charge carrier into the metal reflector, occurring with a probability $\\eta_{injm}$. \n \tAn additional assumption is made in that once injected into the reflector, the charge carrier will travel through an external circuit to the counter electrode  where finally \n \t(iv) the total current is measured when an electron--donating species in solution injects an electron into the positively--charged metal nanoparticles with a probability $\\eta_{ed}$ \\cite{Moskovits_NN2015a}.\n \t\n\nThe hot--electron injection efficiency $\\eta_{inj}$ is determined by the  energy--momentum distribution of the hot--electron population that results from Landau damping of plasmons.\nLittle is known at present about these  energy--momentum distributions.\n\nTo get an estimate of $\\eta_{inj}$, we assume that Landau damping produces an isotropic momentum distribution \\cite{Scales_QEIJO2010a} and approximate the energy distribution of hot--electrons as a product of the initial and final (parabolic) density of electron states in the metal.\nWe furthermore consider the initial states to have energies  ranging from below (and up to) the Fermi level $E_F$, whereas the final states are thought to have energies   from the Fermi level and up to  $E_F$ + the incident photon energy \\cite{White_APL2012a}.\n$\\eta_{inj}$ is then approximated as  $P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB}|k_e)\\otimes\\langle T\\rangle$ [see equation \\eqref{eq:S_eta_inj}], where: \n$\\langle T\\rangle$ is the transmission coefficient for electrons across the metal nanoparticle--semiconductor interface (calculated taking into account conservation of momentum, see section \\ref{sec:S_T})\nand,\n$P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB}|k_e)$ is the  fraction of the   hot--electron population for which the electrons have  a momentum $k_e$ that lies within the escape cone of the metal--semiconductor interface and \nwith energies $E_e$ above the Schottky barrier [see equation \\eqref{eq:S_momentum}].\nAs shown in figure 3A,  $\\eta_{inj}$ increases  slowly with incident photon energy\n[details of the calculations leading to figure \\ref{fig:Fig4}(A) are shown in the supplementary section S3, note that we do not consider possible quantum mechanical tunnelling of electrons under the barrier].\n\n\n\nThe charge--carrier transport efficiency $\\eta_\\text{trpt}$ is the probability that, after injection, the charge carrier is transported    through the TiO$_2$ layer, without experiencing  scattering and/or trapping at defect states, the probability of which we assume to be determined by the ratio of the thickness of the metal--oxide layer  and the  mean--free path for electrons\\cite{Seah_SAIA1979a} (see section \\ref{sec:eta_trpt}).\n$\\eta_{injm}$, is approximated by the transmission coefficient for  electrons to traverse the semiconductor--metal (reflector) interface, thus accounting for possible reflections \ndue to the momentum and energy mismatch  \n(more details in section \\ref{sec:S_eta_injm}). \nFor simplicity, we do not account for possible electron flow from the metal reflector into the semiconductor, which may originate from the excitation and decay of surface plasmon polaritons at the metal/semiconductor interface.\nThis charge flow will have an opposite direction and thus decrease the measured photocurrents and IPCE \\cite{Chalabi_NL2014a, Wang_NL2011a}.\n\nThe calculated values of $\\eta$ (assuming $\\eta_{ed}=1$) and \n$A_{layer}\\times\\eta$ produce the dotted and continuous lines in Figure \\ref{fig:Fig4}B respectively.\n$\\eta$  is strongly dependent on the magnitude of $\\Phi_{SB}$, the thickness of the oxide layer and the height of the energy barrier preventing electron injection at the semiconductor--mirror interface.\nThe model satisfactorily reproduces the slow increase of the measured IPCE with incident photon energy, in particular, for a value of $\\Phi_{SB}$ = 1.20 eV reported by the experiments of Lee {\\it et al} \\cite{Lee_NL2011a} \n\n\n\nIn the model, this curvature originates from a combination of two factors:\n(i) the almost rectangular  shape of the energy distribution of hot carriers, which  limits the number of these carriers that meets the energy requirements for injection [i.e. $E>\\Phi_{SB}$, see curve $P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB})$ of fig. 4A] and,\n(ii) the narrow escape cone for carriers from the metal nanoparticles and into the semiconductor, which  severely limits the total fraction of ``useful'' charge carriers by almost 75\\% [see figure S9(B)].\nFactor (i) is a consequence of the assumed broad energy distribution of initial states, whereas (ii) originates from the assumed uniform distribution of electron momenta resulting from Landau damping.\n\nAt higher energies, the calculated drop in $A_{layer}\\times\\eta$ is in qualitative agreement with the experimental results, which is a consequence of the fact that at these wavelengths, light is predominantly absorbed by the mirror (see figure 1D).\nA simple conclusion that can be drawn from these observations is that, in spite of the spectrally broad and strong absorption of light achievable with the metal--semiconductor--nanoparticle structure, the generation of charge--carriers from plasmon relaxation in this architecture is limited to those spectral regions where  the incident  photon energies are  in excess of  the metal--semiconductor Schottky barrier and below the onset for strong absorption by the metal reflecting layer.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbph!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{SI/Fig_theory4}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Narrow distribution of states near the Fermi level of the metal}. (A) Distribution of electron energies and  (B) calculated internal quantum efficiency.\n The shaded areas highlight the attainable differences. $\\Phi_{SB}$ = 0.98 eV.}\n\\label{fig:5}\n\\end{figure}\nAccording to the model, the ICPE is expected to increase if the  plasmon relaxation were to result in narrow electron energy distributions.\nThis is a situation that can be modelled by considering that the bottom of the conduction band is close ($\\sim$ 0.15 eV) to the Fermi level of the metal \\cite{Chan_QEIJO1980a, White_APL2012a}, a hypothetical (and somewhat unrealistic) situation depicted in \nfigure \\ref{fig:5}.\nThe orange curve in fig. \\ref{fig:5}(A) shows that for this hypothetical case, the fraction of the population of hot--electrons with $E_e>\\Phi_{SB}$ is almost a step function of the incident photon energy and becomes energy--independent (and unit) for energies slightly above $\\Phi_{SB}$.\nThis step--like $P(E_e>\\Phi_{SB})$ drastically changes the shape of $\\eta$ [fig. \\ref{fig:5}(B)] and leads to an overall increase in the expected internal efficiency\n\n\nThe measured IPCEs are  well below the predictions of our model, which were made under the assumption of unit $\\eta_{ed}$.\n$\\eta_{ed}$ in the photo--electrochemical configuration that we adopted for extracting hot--charge carriers is\nexpected to be limited by the kinetics of charge and mass transfer occurring at the solid--liquid interfaces.\nIn figure 4C we show the measured IPCE changes for a sample where the (sacrificial) electron donating species were changed from Methanol  (MeOH) to Ethanol (EtOH) and to Isopropanol (IPA).\nAn uniform increase in the IPCE is clearly observable for the case of EtOH, which is attributable solely to changes in the kinetic and thermodynamic processes taking place at the photoanode/liquid junction.\n\n$\\eta_{ed}$ is a parameter which is not included in our theoretical description of plasmonic hot--charge carrier extraction, but which seems to play a key role in determining the IPCE in our photo--electrochemical cell, an observation also conjectured in (solid state) plasmonic solar cells\\cite{Reineck_AM2012a}, where it was found that hole accumulation at the metal nanoparticles limits device performance.\n\n\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated the extraction of plasmonic--derived charge carriers from a multi--layer stack comprising a monolayer of Au nanoparticles.\nThese multilayer structures exhibit broadband and intense \n\nabsorption of light, which leads to a significant increase in the incident photon--to--electron conversion efficiencies.  \nWe have developed a simple model to describe the hot--charge carrier generation and transport in this system, which satisfactorily describes the measured IPCE spectra.\nAccording to this  model, the broad distribution of hot--charge carrier energies and their uniform distribution of momenta, account for the weak increase in measured IPCE with  incident  photon energies.\n\nA more efficient strategy for generating and extracting plasmonic hot charge carriers is one that combines strong near--unit absorption of light with a mechanism, such as the plasmon-induced metal-to-semiconductor interfacial charge transfer transition, where a quantum yield for electron injection of $>$24\\% has been found to be  independent of the incident photon energy \\cite{Wu_S2015a}. \nOur results demonstrate that significant enhancements in\nthe efficiencies of opto--electronic and photoelectrochemical devices that operate with plasmonic--derived hot--charge carriers can be achieved by tailoring the optical properties of the plasmonic nanostructures.\n\n\\textbf{Methods}\n\n{\\footnotesize  \n\n\\textbf{Material fabrication and Characterization}\nThe Al and Au  mirrors were deposited onto glass substrates with an in--house constructed electron beam evaporator equipped with transmittance monitoring. \nA thin layer of Cr was deposited prior to the Au deposition to ensure good adhesion to the glass substrate. \nFor both Al and Au mirrors, deposition was conducted by monitoring the optical transmittance  to ensure the films had no transmittance of light. \nSubsequently, the TiO$_2$ layers (30 nm and 50 nm) were deposited onto the metal supporting mirrors through an ion--assisted electron beam evaporation process at 200$^\\circ$C. \nThe bombardment of oxygen during the deposition process ensured the deposition of stoichiometric TiO$_2$ onto the mirrors.  \nLastly, the Au nanoparticles were deposited with a similar electron beam evaporation process with two types of in--situ optical monitoring. \nA broadband transmittance was utilized to monitor the absorption of the Au nanoparticles, while an ellipsometry measurement at 633 nm was employed to achieve non--overlapping particles and detect the deposition point at which  the particles coagulate to form continuous films. \nScanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the Au NPs were obtained with a Zeiss Merlin Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope. \nThe diffuse and specular reflectance ($R$) and  transmittance ($T$) spectra were measured using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer Lambda 1050) with an integrating sphere and small spot kit. \nWith these two measurements, the absorbance was calculated as $A = 1 - R - T$. \n\n\\textbf{Photoelectrochemical measurements}\nThe designed structure and platinum wire was employed as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively in a 2 electrode system. \nThe exposed surface area of the working electrode was 1 cm in diameter. \nThe electrolyte solution used was 0.5 M Na$_2$SO$_4$ (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich, $\\ge$99\\%) with 20 v/v \\% amount of methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, $\\ge$99.9\\%) or ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, $\\ge$99.9\\%) as the sacrificial reagent.\n The 0.5 M Na$_2$SO$_4$ was employed to reduce the resistance in the electrolyte solution. \n Prior to the photocurrent measurements, the solutions were purged with N$_2$ gas to remove  electron scavenging O$_2$. \n The working potential was set at +0.5 V versus the Pt wire and the devices were illuminated with light from a 300 W Xenon lamp (Newport Model no. 669092) using a $\\ge$ 495 nm cut-off filter (Thorlabs FGL-495). \n The applied voltage and photocurrent $I$ were recorded with a potentiostat (AutoLab PGSTAT204). \n To measure the IPCE values, light from the Xenon lamp was coupled to a monochromator with a bandwidth of 5 nm at full width at half maximum (FWHM). \n The light intensity $P$ of the monochromatic light at each wavelength was measured using a Thorlabs optical power and energy meter (Model. PM100D). \n The incident photon to electron efficiency (IPCE) was calculated by the following formula: \n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\text{IPCE} = 100\\times\\frac{I(A/cm^2)}{P(W/cm^2)}\\times\\frac{1240}{\\lambda(nm)}.\n\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\text{IPCE}=100\\times\\frac{I(A/cm^{2})}{P(W/cm^{2})}\\times\\frac{1240}{\\lambda(%&#10;nm)}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mtext>IPCE</mtext><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>100</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>W</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>m</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u00d7</mo><mfrac><mn>1240</mn><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
