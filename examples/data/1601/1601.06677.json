Also shown is ${F_\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ normalized by ${F_\\mathrm{FID}}$, the filter function of the free induction decay for the same total separation time (see Methods).\nThis normalization removes the comb of minima related to the total length of the sequence and makes the filter shape independent of $n$ for even $n$.\nAll of these filter functions are periodic with period $2/\\tau$, with minima at zero frequency and multiples of $2/\\tau$.\n\nSpecific features of the filter functions can be exploited to decouple the qubit from its characterisitic noise environment.\nFirst, for fixed separation time $T = n\\tau$, the filter minimum near zero frequency becomes wider for increasing $n$ (i.e., decreasing $\\tau$, note that the frequency axis in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}b is normalized by $1/\\tau$).\nThus for fixed $T$ decoupling from low frequency $1/f^\\beta$-type noise ($\\beta>0$) becomes more efficient as $n$ increases. \nSecond, the rate $1/\\tau$ of $\\pi$ pulses can be set to discrete frequencies, which allows decoupling from specific narrow-band noise sources (notch filtering) by placing the filter minima that occur at multiples of $1/\\tau$ at appropriate frequencies. \n\nA schematic of the spectral density of nuclear noise for the $S$-$T_0$ qubit fabricated in a GaAs heterostructure is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}c, distinguishing longitudinal low frequency noise (green) and transverse narrow-band noise (red). \nThe low frequency longitudinal contribution is well described by a power-law spectrum~\\cite{Reilly2008,Medford2012}, and can be removed efficiently by any CPMG sequence (Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d). \nThe high frequency transverse contribution due to relative Larmor precession of nuclei is concentrated near the three Larmor frequency differences \\cite{Cywinski2009a}, at megahertz timescales for tesla-scale applied fields. Remarkably, two of the Larmor difference frequencies, ${f_{^{71}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{69}{\\rm Ga}}}$ and ${f_{^{69}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{75}{\\rm As}}}$, are nearly equal, independent of magnetic field, and hence the third frequency difference, ${f_{^{71}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{75}{\\rm As}}}$, occurs at twice that frequency. This coincidental property of the three nuclear species allows us to approximately align minima of the filter function with {\\it all three} frequency differences  by correctly choosing the time between $\\pi$ pulses, $\\tau$, thereby decoupling the qubit from low and high frequency nuclear noise simultaneously.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=1]{fig3}\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Revival of coherence due to decoupling from nuclear Larmor precession.}\n\t\\textbf{a}, Singlet return probability, $P_S$, as a function of the time between $\\pi$ pulses, $\\tau$, for various numbers of $\\pi$ pulses, $n$.

This is related to decoherence arising from low frequency noise (shaded green in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b) \\cite{Medford2012}.\nRevivals observed for Hahn-echo sequences can be explained similarly, except that the filter function for $\\tau\\approx$ 1.1 $\\mu$s has a maximum near  0.9 MHz (Fig.~\\ref{fig3}c), rather than a minimum. Accordingly,  $P_S$ shows a minimum near $\\tau=1.1$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ instead of a revival (cf. $n=1$ data in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a).\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=1]{fig4}\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Effect of magnetic field and $\\mathbf{\\tau}$ on qubit coherence.}\n\t\\textbf{a}, Singlet return probability $P_S$ as a function of time between $\\pi$ pulses, $\\tau$, and external magnetic field, ${B^\\mathrm{ext}}$, for  a fixed number of $\\pi$ pulses, $n=256$.\n\tInset: A semiclassical model, generalizing the model of \\cite{Neder2011} to the case of CPMG sequences, with no free parameters (see Supplementary Information).

Inset: Alignment of the normalized filter function with nuclear noise spectrum for this choice of $\\tau$ and ${B^\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n\t}\n\t\\label{fig5}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFinally we comment on the limits of preserving qubit coherence. \nMost of the observed features in Fig.~\\ref{fig4}a are captured by a generalization of the semiclassical model of Ref.~\\cite{Neder2011}, modified to include the details of the CPMG pulse sequence.\nThe model involves four device-specific parameters (Fig.~\\ref{fig4} inset): \nthe effective number of nuclei interacting with each electron, $N=7\\times10^5$, \na phenomenological broadening, $\\delta B=1.1$ mT,  of the effective magnetic field acting on nuclei (likely due to quadrupolar splitting arising from electric field gradients \\cite{Bluhm2011,Neder2011}),\nthe spectral diffusion time, $T_\\mathrm{SD} = 600$ $\\mu$s, \nand the exponent associated with the linear low frequency noise, $\\beta=3$ (all determined by independent measurements as described in Supplementary Information). \nThe model suggests that the longest coherence time may be achieved by choosing a decoupling condition corresponding to the second revival at high magnetic fields, consistent with a reduced contribution of ${\\bf {B}}^\\mathrm{nuc}_{\\perp}$ to ${B^\\mathrm{tot}}$ in each dot (see Fig.~\\ref{fig1}d) and the decoupling condition depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d. \nWe note that the model does not take pulse errors into account and does not show several fine features observed in experiment (see white arrows in Fig.~\\ref{fig4}a, see Supplementary Information). \n\nAlthough not optimized systematically, the longest coherence time that we observed was ${T_2 ^\\mathrm{CPMG}} = 0.87 \\pm 0.13$ ms (Fig.~\\ref{fig5}), measured at ${B^\\mathrm{ext}}=500$ mT and $\\tau=750$ ns. Interestingly, this decoupling condition corresponds to that shown in the inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig5}, which rejects low frequency noise better than the one shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d. We expect further improvements by using shorter $\\pi$ pulses and nuclear programming \\cite{Foletti2009}. This will improve the fidelity of $\\pi$ pulses and suppress low frequency noise, allowing the advantageous use of the decoupling condition in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d at high magnetic fields and high pulse rates. \n\nIn summary, dynamical decoupling sequences we demonstrated to provide decoupling from narrow-band high frequency noise, acting as a notch filter for the nuclear environment. This technique was used to efficiently decouple a GaAs-based $S$-$T_0$ qubit from its nuclear environment. By synchronizing the repetition rate of $\\pi$ pulses in CPMG sequences with differences of nuclear Larmor frequencies, the coherence of a $S$-$T_0$ qubit coupled to nuclear spin bath was extended the millisecond regime (0.87 ms), five orders of magnitude long than the gate operation time.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank \\L{}ukasz Cywi\\'nski for helpful discussions, and Rasmus Eriksen for help in preparation of the reflectometry setup.\nThis work was supported by IARPA-MQCO, LPS-MPO-CMTC, the Army Research Office, the Villum Foundation and the Danish National Research Foundation.\n\n\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{The sample}\n\nThe sample, identical to the one shown in Fig.~1a, is fabricated from a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well grown by molecular beam epitaxy. \nCrystallographic axes are shown in Fig.~1a. \nA high-mobility 2D electron gas (2DEG) is formed 57 nm below the sample surface with carrier density $n_s$~=~$2.5\\times10^{15}$~m$^{-2}$ and mobility $\\mu$~=~230~m$^{2}$/Vs. Metallic gates, separated from the heterostructure by a 10 nm layer of HfO$_2$, are used to confine two electrons in the region indicated by a rectangle in Fig.~1a.  Gates indicated in blue and red are operated at negative voltages to deplete the 2DEG underneath, while gates colored in green are biased with positive voltages to accumulate electrons beneath. The charge state and tunnel coupling of the double dot can be controlled on a nanosecond timescale by applying voltage pulses to gates ${V_\\mathrm{L}}$, ${V_\\mathrm{M}}$ and ${V_\\mathrm{R}}$. \n\n\\subsection{Initialization and readout of the qubit}\n\nThe sample is measured at a base temperature of 25~mK in a cryofree dilution refrigerator, with an external magnetic field ${B^\\mathrm{ext}}$ applied parallel to the $z$ direction indicated in Fig.~1a. \nThe qubit is initialized in a singlet state by tilting its charge state into the (2,0) charge configuration and allowing the exchange of electrons with the left lead near the (1,0) charge transition \\cite{Petta2005}.\n\nAfter qubit manipulation the state of the qubit is measured by tilting the double well potential to favour the (2,0) charge state. If the two electrons are in the spin triplet configuration, Pauli blockade prevents reaching the (2,0) state, and the charge configuration remains (1,1).\nThe charge state of the double dot modifies the conductance through a proximity sensor dot operated as a single electron transistor. This sensor dot is embedded in a radio-frequency resonant circuit, enabling us to distinguish singlet and triplet states in 8 $\\mu$s with a readout visibility of approximately 80\\%, as defined in Ref. \\cite{Barthel2010}.\n\n\\subsection{Normalization of filter functions}\n\nFilter functions for Hahn echo and CPMG sequence (for even number of $\\pi$ pulses, $n$) are given by \\cite{Cywinski2008}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 12618, "prevtext": "\n\n\\title{Notch filtering the nuclear environment of a spin qubit}\n\n\\author{Filip~K.~Malinowski}\n\\thanks{These authors contributed equally to this work}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Frederico~Martins}\n\\thanks{These authors contributed equally to this work}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Peter~D.~Nissen}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Edwin~Barnes}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, USA}\n\\affiliation{Condensed Matter Theory Center and Joint Quantum Institute, Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742-4111, USA}\n\n\\author{Mark~S.~Rudner}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\\affiliation{Niels Bohr International Academy, Niels Bohr Institute, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Saeed~Fallahi}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics and Astronomy, Birck Nanotechnology Center, and Microsoft Station Q Purdue, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\n\\author{Geoffrey~C.~Gardner}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics and Astronomy, Birck Nanotechnology Center, and Microsoft Station Q Purdue, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\\affiliation{School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\n\\author{Michael~J.~Manfra}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics and Astronomy, Birck Nanotechnology Center, and Microsoft Station Q Purdue, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\\affiliation{School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\n\\author{Charles~M.~Marcus}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Ferdinand~Kuemmeth}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\\textbf{\nElectron spins in gate-defined quantum dots provide a promising platform for quantum computation \\cite{Loss1998,Veldhorst2015,Nowack2011,Koppens2006,Bluhm2011,Petta2005,Nowack2007,Maune2012}.\nIn particular, spin-based quantum computing in gallium arsenide takes advantage of the high quality of semiconducting materials, reliability in fabricating arrays of quantum dots, and accurate qubit operations \\cite{Martins2015,Nowack2007,Petta2005,Maune2012,Foletti2009,Dial2013}.\nHowever, the effective magnetic noise arising from the hyperfine interaction with uncontrolled nuclear spins in the host lattice constitutes a major source of decoherence \\cite{Petta2005,Koppens2006,Bluhm2011,Martins2015}. \nLow frequency nuclear noise, responsible for fast (10 ns) inhomogeneous dephasing \\cite{Petta2005}, can be removed by echo techniques \\cite{Viola1998, Barthel2010, Medford2012}.

Also shown is ${F_\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ normalized by ${F_\\mathrm{FID}}$, the filter function of the free induction decay for the same total separation time (see Methods).\nThis normalization removes the comb of minima related to the total length of the sequence and makes the filter shape independent of $n$ for even $n$.\nAll of these filter functions are periodic with period $2/\\tau$, with minima at zero frequency and multiples of $2/\\tau$.\n\nSpecific features of the filter functions can be exploited to decouple the qubit from its characterisitic noise environment.\nFirst, for fixed separation time $T = n\\tau$, the filter minimum near zero frequency becomes wider for increasing $n$ (i.e., decreasing $\\tau$, note that the frequency axis in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}b is normalized by $1/\\tau$).\nThus for fixed $T$ decoupling from low frequency $1/f^\\beta$-type noise ($\\beta>0$) becomes more efficient as $n$ increases. \nSecond, the rate $1/\\tau$ of $\\pi$ pulses can be set to discrete frequencies, which allows decoupling from specific narrow-band noise sources (notch filtering) by placing the filter minima that occur at multiples of $1/\\tau$ at appropriate frequencies. \n\nA schematic of the spectral density of nuclear noise for the $S$-$T_0$ qubit fabricated in a GaAs heterostructure is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}c, distinguishing longitudinal low frequency noise (green) and transverse narrow-band noise (red). \nThe low frequency longitudinal contribution is well described by a power-law spectrum~\\cite{Reilly2008,Medford2012}, and can be removed efficiently by any CPMG sequence (Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d). \nThe high frequency transverse contribution due to relative Larmor precession of nuclei is concentrated near the three Larmor frequency differences \\cite{Cywinski2009a}, at megahertz timescales for tesla-scale applied fields. Remarkably, two of the Larmor difference frequencies, ${f_{^{71}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{69}{\\rm Ga}}}$ and ${f_{^{69}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{75}{\\rm As}}}$, are nearly equal, independent of magnetic field, and hence the third frequency difference, ${f_{^{71}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{75}{\\rm As}}}$, occurs at twice that frequency. This coincidental property of the three nuclear species allows us to approximately align minima of the filter function with {\\it all three} frequency differences  by correctly choosing the time between $\\pi$ pulses, $\\tau$, thereby decoupling the qubit from low and high frequency nuclear noise simultaneously.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=1]{fig3}\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Revival of coherence due to decoupling from nuclear Larmor precession.}\n\t\\textbf{a}, Singlet return probability, $P_S$, as a function of the time between $\\pi$ pulses, $\\tau$, for various numbers of $\\pi$ pulses, $n$.

This is related to decoherence arising from low frequency noise (shaded green in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b) \\cite{Medford2012}.\nRevivals observed for Hahn-echo sequences can be explained similarly, except that the filter function for $\\tau\\approx$ 1.1 $\\mu$s has a maximum near  0.9 MHz (Fig.~\\ref{fig3}c), rather than a minimum.

Inset: Alignment of the normalized filter function with nuclear noise spectrum for this choice of $\\tau$ and ${B^\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n\t}\n\t\\label{fig5}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFinally we comment on the limits of preserving qubit coherence. \nMost of the observed features in Fig.~\\ref{fig4}a are captured by a generalization of the semiclassical model of Ref.~\\cite{Neder2011}, modified to include the details of the CPMG pulse sequence.\nThe model involves four device-specific parameters (Fig.~\\ref{fig4} inset): \nthe effective number of nuclei interacting with each electron, $N=7\\times10^5$, \na phenomenological broadening, $\\delta B=1.1$ mT,  of the effective magnetic field acting on nuclei (likely due to quadrupolar splitting arising from electric field gradients \\cite{Bluhm2011,Neder2011}),\nthe spectral diffusion time, $T_\\mathrm{SD} = 600$ $\\mu$s, \nand the exponent associated with the linear low frequency noise, $\\beta=3$ (all determined by independent measurements as described in Supplementary Information). \nThe model suggests that the longest coherence time may be achieved by choosing a decoupling condition corresponding to the second revival at high magnetic fields, consistent with a reduced contribution of ${\\bf {B}}^\\mathrm{nuc}_{\\perp}$ to ${B^\\mathrm{tot}}$ in each dot (see Fig.~\\ref{fig1}d) and the decoupling condition depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d. \nWe note that the model does not take pulse errors into account and does not show several fine features observed in experiment (see white arrows in Fig.~\\ref{fig4}a, see Supplementary Information). \n\nAlthough not optimized systematically, the longest coherence time that we observed was ${T_2 ^\\mathrm{CPMG}} = 0.87 \\pm 0.13$ ms (Fig.~\\ref{fig5}), measured at ${B^\\mathrm{ext}}=500$ mT and $\\tau=750$ ns. Interestingly, this decoupling condition corresponds to that shown in the inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig5}, which rejects low frequency noise better than the one shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d. We expect further improvements by using shorter $\\pi$ pulses and nuclear programming \\cite{Foletti2009}. This will improve the fidelity of $\\pi$ pulses and suppress low frequency noise, allowing the advantageous use of the decoupling condition in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}d at high magnetic fields and high pulse rates. \n\nIn summary, dynamical decoupling sequences we demonstrated to provide decoupling from narrow-band high frequency noise, acting as a notch filter for the nuclear environment. This technique was used to efficiently decouple a GaAs-based $S$-$T_0$ qubit from its nuclear environment. By synchronizing the repetition rate of $\\pi$ pulses in CPMG sequences with differences of nuclear Larmor frequencies, the coherence of a $S$-$T_0$ qubit coupled to nuclear spin bath was extended the millisecond regime (0.87 ms), five orders of magnitude long than the gate operation time.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank \\L{}ukasz Cywi\\'nski for helpful discussions, and Rasmus Eriksen for help in preparation of the reflectometry setup.\nThis work was supported by IARPA-MQCO, LPS-MPO-CMTC, the Army Research Office, the Villum Foundation and the Danish National Research Foundation.\n\n\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{The sample}\n\nThe sample, identical to the one shown in Fig.~1a, is fabricated from a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well grown by molecular beam epitaxy. \nCrystallographic axes are shown in Fig.~1a. \nA high-mobility 2D electron gas (2DEG) is formed 57 nm below the sample surface with carrier density $n_s$~=~$2.5\\times10^{15}$~m$^{-2}$ and mobility $\\mu$~=~230~m$^{2}$/Vs. Metallic gates, separated from the heterostructure by a 10 nm layer of HfO$_2$, are used to confine two electrons in the region indicated by a rectangle in Fig.~1a.  Gates indicated in blue and red are operated at negative voltages to deplete the 2DEG underneath, while gates colored in green are biased with positive voltages to accumulate electrons beneath. The charge state and tunnel coupling of the double dot can be controlled on a nanosecond timescale by applying voltage pulses to gates ${V_\\mathrm{L}}$, ${V_\\mathrm{M}}$ and ${V_\\mathrm{R}}$. \n\n\\subsection{Initialization and readout of the qubit}\n\nThe sample is measured at a base temperature of 25~mK in a cryofree dilution refrigerator, with an external magnetic field ${B^\\mathrm{ext}}$ applied parallel to the $z$ direction indicated in Fig.~1a. \nThe qubit is initialized in a singlet state by tilting its charge state into the (2,0) charge configuration and allowing the exchange of electrons with the left lead near the (1,0) charge transition \\cite{Petta2005}.\n\nAfter qubit manipulation the state of the qubit is measured by tilting the double well potential to favour the (2,0) charge state. If the two electrons are in the spin triplet configuration, Pauli blockade prevents reaching the (2,0) state, and the charge configuration remains (1,1).\nThe charge state of the double dot modifies the conductance through a proximity sensor dot operated as a single electron transistor. This sensor dot is embedded in a radio-frequency resonant circuit, enabling us to distinguish singlet and triplet states in 8 $\\mu$s with a readout visibility of approximately 80\\%, as defined in Ref. \\cite{Barthel2010}.\n\n\\subsection{Normalization of filter functions}\n\nFilter functions for Hahn echo and CPMG sequence (for even number of $\\pi$ pulses, $n$) are given by \\cite{Cywinski2008}\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\t{F_\\mathrm{Hahn}}(f \\tau) = 8 \\sin^4 \\left( \\pi f \\tau/2 \\right);\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{F_{\\mathrm{Hahn}}}(f\\tau)=8\\sin^{4}\\left(\\pi f\\tau/2\\right);\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>Hahn</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>8</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>4</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>;</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06677.tex", "nexttext": "\nTo emphasize the qualitative difference between CPMG sequences and the Hahn echo sequence, and represent features of CPMG filter functions relevant for large number of $\\pi$ pulses, $n$, we divide ${F_\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ by the filter function corresponding to free induction decay\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 27221, "prevtext": "\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\t{F_\\mathrm{CPMG}}(f \\tau) = \\frac{ 8 \\sin^4 \\left( \\pi f \\tau / 2 \\right) \\sin^2 \\left(\\pi f \\tau n \\right) }{ \\cos^2 \\left(\\pi f \\tau \\right) }.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{F_{\\mathrm{CPMG}}}(f\\tau)=\\frac{8\\sin^{4}\\left(\\pi f\\tau/2\\right)\\sin^{2}%&#10;\\left(\\pi f\\tau n\\right)}{\\cos^{2}\\left(\\pi f\\tau\\right)}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>CPMG</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>8</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>4</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>sin</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><msup><mi>cos</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06677.tex", "nexttext": "\nHere $T=\\tau n$ corresponds to a free induction decay with the same total duration as a CPMG sequence.

Typical values of these parameters for fits used to extract values of ${T_2 ^\\mathrm{CPMG}}$ shown in Fig.~4c are $A\\sim 0.6$ and $B\\sim 0.2$. Fit to the data presented in Fig.~5 yields $A=0.53$ and $B=0.34$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\\newpage\n\n\\setcounter{figure}{0}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0}\n\\setcounter{page}{1}\n\n\\title{Notch filtering the nuclear environment of a spin qubit -- supplementary information}\n\n\\author{Filip~K.~Malinowski}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Frederico~Martins}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Peter~D.~Nissen}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Edwin~Barnes}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061, USA}\n\\affiliation{Condensed Matter Theory Center and Joint Quantum Institute, Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742-4111, USA}\n\n\\author{Mark~S.~Rudner}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\\affiliation{Niels Bohr International Academy, Niels Bohr Institute, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Saeed~Fallahi}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics and Astronomy, Birck Nanotechnology Center, and Microsoft Station Q Purdue, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\n\\author{Geoffrey~C.~Gardner}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics and Astronomy, Birck Nanotechnology Center, and Microsoft Station Q Purdue, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\\affiliation{School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\n\\author{Michael~J.~Manfra}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics and Astronomy, Birck Nanotechnology Center, and Microsoft Station Q Purdue, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\\affiliation{School of Materials Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, USA}\n\n\\author{Charles~M.~Marcus}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\\author{Ferdinand~Kuemmeth}\n\\affiliation{Center for Quantum Devices and Station Q Copenhagen, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark}\n\n\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\n\\onecolumngrid\n\n\\section*{\\large Supplementary Information for\\\\ \"Notch filtering the nuclear environment of a spin qubit\"}\n\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\small\t\n\t\\begin{minipage}[l]{0.8\\textwidth}\n\t\tThis supplement is divided into sections, which discuss the following topics:\n\t\t\\begin{itemize}\n\t\t\t\\item[1.] Semiclassical model of decoherence due to nuclear noise\n\t\t\t\\item[2.] Estimating $N$ and $\\delta B$ from Hahn echo signal\n\t\t\t\\item[3.] Estimating $T_\\mathrm{SD}$ and $\\beta$ from scaling of coherence time\n\t\t\t\\item[4.] Extension of the model to take into account anisotropy of electron $g$-factor.

Estimating $N$ and $\\delta B$ from Hahn echo signal}\n\nThe simulation of revivals under CPMG sequences requires knowledge of four device-specific parameters, two of which, the effective number, $N$, of nuclei interacting with each electron and the inhomogeneity, $\\delta B$, of the effective magnetic field acting on the nuclei, are extracted from Hahn echo data obtained at several magnetic fields (Fig.~\\ref{figS1}). Following previous work \\cite{Bluhm2011,Neder2011} we first fit theory to Hahn echo data at each magnetic field separately, keeping $\\delta B$, $N$, the spectral diffusion time for Hahn echo, $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn}$, vertical offset, and vertical scaling as free parameters.\nSetting $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn} \\gg 1$ ms gives essentially equally good fits (i.e. $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn}$ cannot be determined accurately by this method) but values for $\\delta B$ and $N$ obtained at various magnetic fields (150-350 mT) differ from each other by less than 20\\%. Therefore we average these values and obtain  $\\delta B = 1.1$ mT and $N = 7\\times 10^5$. Fixing these values and $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn}=\\infty$, we leave vertical offset and vertical scaling as the only free parameters, and obtain excellent agreement for all magnetic fields, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{figS1}.\n\n\\subsection{3. Estimating $T_\\mathrm{SD}$ and $\\beta$ scaling of coherence time}\n\nTo estimate the spectral diffusion time $T_\\mathrm{SD}$ for the simulation in Fig.~4a we quantify the scaling of the CPMG coherence time with the number of $\\pi$ pulses $n$ in a regime where revivals are not yet developed (i.e. for $n\\leq 32$ at 750 mT)  \\cite{Medford2012}.  \nThe coherence time is found to be proportional to $n^\\gamma$, with $\\gamma \\sim 0.75$ \\cite{Malinowski2016}.\nUsing this scaling behaviour we infer $T_\\mathrm{SD} \\approx 0.6$ ms for a CPMG sequence with 256 $\\pi$-pulses. Using the relationship $\\beta = \\gamma / (1-\\gamma)$ \\cite{Medford2012} the exponent $\\gamma=0.75$ corresponds to a power law of low-frequency noise governed by $1/f^\\beta$ behaviour, with $\\beta=3$, consistent with predictions for GaAs \\cite{Witzel2006} and in reasonable agreement with previous measurements \\cite{Medford2012}.\n\n\\subsection{4. Splitting of the first revival peak}\n\nA possible explanation for the observed splitting in the first revival peak (Fig.~4a) is based on the anisotropy of the electronic $g$-factor. The $g$-factor anisotropy between [011] and [01-1] primary axes can be as high as 15\\% in asymmetric GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells \\cite{Nefyodov2011}. In Ref.~\\cite{Botzem2015} it was shown that the anisotropy has a strong impact on $S$-$T_0$ qubit coherence when the magnetic field is not parallel to one of the main axes. The combination of the anisotropy and small misalignment of the external magnetic field with the [011] crystal axis changes the magnetic field term in the system Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:NoiseHam}) to:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 33984, "prevtext": "\nwhere $t_j$ is the time at which the $j$-th $\\pi$ pulse of the CPMG sequence is applied (with $t_0=0$, $t_{n+1}=T$). \n\nIn Ref. \\cite{Neder2011}, only the Hahn echo sequence was treated.

The latter leads to the appearance of individual nuclear Larmor frequencies  in the nuclear noise spectrum in addition to nuclear difference frequencies \\cite{Botzem2015}. As a result, the CPMG sequence will not be as efficient in suppressing nuclear noise even when the pulses are commensurate with all three difference frequencies.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{figS2} we present simulations showing the consequences of $g$-factor anisotropy. Panel (a) shows the simulation presented in the inset of Fig.~4a, i.e. $g_\\perp / g_\\parallel = 0$. In panel (b) we show a simulation including $g_\\perp / g_\\parallel = 0.01$, which is the observed value in Ref.~\\cite{Botzem2015} for the direction of the magnetic field used in our experiment. Here a splitting of the first revival peak appears (indicated by a white arrow) as well as more complex fine structure in other revival peaks. Such fine structure is beyond the resolution of the experimental data.\n\nWe note that a splitting of the first revival peak appears exactly when the frequency of $\\pi$ pulses coincides with a difference of Larmor frequencies ${f_{^{71}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{69}{\\rm Ga}}}$ and ${f_{^{69}{\\rm Ga}}} - {f_{^{75}{\\rm As}}}$. Therefore other mechanisms might also lead to the appearance of the splitting.

Estimating $N$ and $\\delta B$ from Hahn echo signal}\n\nThe simulation of revivals under CPMG sequences requires knowledge of four device-specific parameters, two of which, the effective number, $N$, of nuclei interacting with each electron and the inhomogeneity, $\\delta B$, of the effective magnetic field acting on the nuclei, are extracted from Hahn echo data obtained at several magnetic fields (Fig.~\\ref{figS1}). Following previous work \\cite{Bluhm2011,Neder2011} we first fit theory to Hahn echo data at each magnetic field separately, keeping $\\delta B$, $N$, the spectral diffusion time for Hahn echo, $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn}$, vertical offset, and vertical scaling as free parameters.\nSetting $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn} \\gg 1$ ms gives essentially equally good fits (i.e. $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn}$ cannot be determined accurately by this method) but values for $\\delta B$ and $N$ obtained at various magnetic fields (150-350 mT) differ from each other by less than 20\\%. Therefore we average these values and obtain  $\\delta B = 1.1$ mT and $N = 7\\times 10^5$. Fixing these values and $T_\\mathrm{SD}^\\mathrm{Hahn}=\\infty$, we leave vertical offset and vertical scaling as the only free parameters, and obtain excellent agreement for all magnetic fields, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{figS1}.\n\n\\subsection{3. Estimating $T_\\mathrm{SD}$ and $\\beta$ scaling of coherence time}\n\nTo estimate the spectral diffusion time $T_\\mathrm{SD}$ for the simulation in Fig.~4a we quantify the scaling of the CPMG coherence time with the number of $\\pi$ pulses $n$ in a regime where revivals are not yet developed (i.e. for $n\\leq 32$ at 750 mT)  \\cite{Medford2012}.  \nThe coherence time is found to be proportional to $n^\\gamma$, with $\\gamma \\sim 0.75$ \\cite{Malinowski2016}.\nUsing this scaling behaviour we infer $T_\\mathrm{SD} \\approx 0.6$ ms for a CPMG sequence with 256 $\\pi$-pulses. Using the relationship $\\beta = \\gamma / (1-\\gamma)$ \\cite{Medford2012} the exponent $\\gamma=0.75$ corresponds to a power law of low-frequency noise governed by $1/f^\\beta$ behaviour, with $\\beta=3$, consistent with predictions for GaAs \\cite{Witzel2006} and in reasonable agreement with previous measurements \\cite{Medford2012}.\n\n\\subsection{4. Splitting of the first revival peak}\n\nA possible explanation for the observed splitting in the first revival peak (Fig.~4a) is based on the anisotropy of the electronic $g$-factor. The $g$-factor anisotropy between [011] and [01-1] primary axes can be as high as 15\\% in asymmetric GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells \\cite{Nefyodov2011}. In Ref.~\\cite{Botzem2015} it was shown that the anisotropy has a strong impact on $S$-$T_0$ qubit coherence when the magnetic field is not parallel to one of the main axes. The combination of the anisotropy and small misalignment of the external magnetic field with the [011] crystal axis changes the magnetic field term in the system Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:NoiseHam}) to:\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:BAniso}\nB_{z,d}^{\\rm nuc}(t) + \\frac{|\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp,d}^{\\rm nuc}(t)|^2}{2|\\mathbf{B}^{\\rm ext}|} + \\frac{g_\\perp}{g_\\parallel} \\left[ B_{x,d}^{\\rm nuc}(t) + B_{y,d}^{\\rm nuc}(t) \\right],\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"B_{z,d}^{\\rm nuc}(t)+\\frac{|\\mathbf{B}_{\\perp,d}^{\\rm nuc}(t)|^{2}}{2|\\mathbf{%&#10;B}^{\\rm ext}|}+\\frac{g_{\\perp}}{g_{\\parallel}}\\left[B_{x,d}^{\\rm nuc}(t)+B_{y,%&#10;d}^{\\rm nuc}(t)\\right],\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>B</mi><mrow><mi>z</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mi>nuc</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>\ud835\udc01</mi><mrow><mo>\u27c2</mo><mo>,</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mi>nuc</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msup><mi>\ud835\udc01</mi><mi>ext</mi></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>g</mi><mo>\u27c2</mo></msub><msub><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2225</mo></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>B</mi><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mi>nuc</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>B</mi><mrow><mi>y</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mi>nuc</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
