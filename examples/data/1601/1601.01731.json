(2001), $(Z/X)_p$ estimated as 0.1, $M_p$ as the mass\ndifference between Ab and Bb (0.166 M$_J$, using Bb's $Msini$), and\n$(Z/X)_{cz}$ estimated by scaling Asplund et al. (2009)'s\n$(Z/X)_{\\odot}=0.134$ to WASP-94A's [Fe/H] (0.32 dex). The required\n$\\Delta$[M/H] for 0.166 M$_J$ of material ``added to'' or ``missing\nfrom'' WASP-94A is $\\sim$0.05 dex, much higher than the\nvolatile/refractory abundance differences of 0.02/0.01\ndex. A similar excercise for WASP-94B still results in $\\sim$0.03 dex\nof material, which is more than is ``missing'' or ``added'' to\nWASP-94B. Furthermore, if as suggested as one source of the refractory enhancement in XO-2N (Teske et\nal. 2015; Ram\\'irez et al. 2015; Biazzo et al. 2015), the refractory\nenhancement seen in this system is due to the migration of a giant\nplanet pushing/dragging rocky material on to the star, why is this accretion\nsignature seen in the star (A) with the \\textit{least} massive planet,\nwhich would presumably have a smaller gravitational effect on rocky material in the\ndisk? \n\nOne can reverse the accretion equation, and instead solve for the mass\nof material that could explain the missing 0.02 dex of volatile/excess\n0.01 dex of refractory material in WASP-94A (or the excess\n0.02/missing 0.01 dex in -94B). In WASP-94A, which likely has a\nsomewhat smaller convection zone than the cooler -94B, a deficit of\n0.02 dex of $(Z/X)_p=0.1$ material requires $\\sim$0.063 M$_J$ of\nmaterial to be ``missing''. In WASP-94B, an enhancement of 0.02 dex of $(Z/X)_p=0.1$\nmaterial requires $\\sim$0.098 M$_J$ of material to be ``added''. These masses are\nlikely too small to be single bodies responsible for dynamical\neffects, e.g., a giant planet affecting the orbits and/or migration of\neither WASP-94Ab or -94Bb (Chatterjee et al. 2008; Ford \\& Rasio 2008). However, such masses could correspond to\nsuper-Earth or Neptune-sized planets (or amounts of material). This material could have been\nscattered inward (increasing the stellar abundance) or outward\n(decreasing the stellar abundance) by planet-planet interactions that may\nhave caused the orbit misalignment and retrograde orbit of\nWASP-94Ab (e.g., Bromley \\& Kenyon 2011; Bromley \\& Kenyon 2014). Alternatively, these bodies could have been accreted onto\nthe star during the inward migration of WASP-94Bb  (Raymond et al. 2011; Fogg \\& Nelson 2005), which has near-zero \n$e$ (0.13$\\pm$0.20, NV14). Figure 1 from Kaib et al. (2013)\nsuggests that a binary like WASP-94 has a $\\sim$0.5 instability\nfraction, and a rather large critical pericenter ($\\sim$200 AU),\nmeaning that if the binary separation evolved at all during the short\nlifetime of the stars, an instability would be more likely.\n\nThe above estimations assume a bulk $(Z/X)_p=0.1$ for planetary mass\nmaterial, based on what is known about the giant planets in the Solar\nSystem (Guillot 2005; Fortney \\& Nettelmann 2010) and other giant\nexoplanets (Miller \\& Fortney 2011). However, if this value were\nsmaller or larger, the effect on the stellar abundances would\ncorrespondingly decrease or increase. The value of $(Z/X)_p$ is not\nconstant across Solar System planets, nor is it independent from the\nsize of the envelope versus the core of the planet (e.g., Fortney \\&\nNettelmann 2010). The proportion of volatile to refractories\ndepends on the formation location, mass, and interior differentiation\nof planets; our model above is only a first-order estimation and\nfuture studies should more thoroughly test the impact of differentiated\nplanet formation on stellar abundances. \n\nThe above calculations also assume a current $M_{cz}$ based on the\nmass of the star, but $M_{cz}$ is known to vary greatly across stellar\nlifetimes (Hayashi 1981; D'Antona \\& Mazzitelli 1994; Serenelli et\nal. 2011). Ram\\'irez et\nal. (2011) explored how varying both $M_{cz}$ and $(Z/X)_p$ changed\nthe amount of material required to account for the abundance\ndifference between 16 Cyg A and B (see their Figure 12), based on both\nstandard stellar models (Serenelli et al. 2011) and non-standard\nmodels of episodic accretion (Baraffe \\& Chabrier 2010). At earlier times when the stellar\nconvection zone is a significant fraction ($\\gtrsim$10\\%) of the mass of the star,\na larger or more metal-rich amount of accreted material is required to cause\nthe same stellar abundance change. For instance, a $M_{cz}=0.01\nM_{\\odot}$ for WASP-94A would require $\\sim$0.20 $M_J$ of material to\ncause a 0.02 dex difference, over 3$\\times$ as much material than the\nsmaller (current) $M_{cz}=0.0032 M_{\\odot}$ case. This might be one way\nto help explain a mass difference of $\\geq$0.166\n$M_J$, as observed between WASP-94Ab and -94Bb, but again the trend is\nopposite of what is expected (A is depleted by $\\sim$0.20 $M_J$, not\nB), and it still leaves the refractory abundance enhancement in WASP-94A unresolved.\n\nPerhaps what is most intriguing is why two ``twin'' similar stars formed\napparently different planets. The planet around WASP-94A is less\nmassive and misaligned with the stellar orbital axis, and likely\nretrograde, both signatures of dynamical interactions in the history\nof the planet's formation and evolution. Why does WASP-94B appear to be circularized? The $T_{eff}$ of both stars put them near the $T_{eff}$ border that Winn et al. (2010) and\nSchlaufman (2010) suggest separates systems in which tidal dissipation\ndamps planetary obliquities within a few Gyr and systems in which\ndissipation is ineffective (stars hotter than 6250 K). Winn et\nal. (2010) explain this break point as where the convection zone mass of stars becomes negligible. Based on the relation in Pinsonneault\net al. (2001), WASP-94A's $M_{cz}$ is between\n$\\sim$0.003 and 0.004 M$_{\\odot}$, while WASP-94B's is between $\\sim$0.005\nand 0.006 M$_{\\odot}$. Perhaps the 2$\\times$ larger convection zone of\nWASP-94B versus -94A was enough to better facilitate tidal circularization of its giant planet. \n\nAnother possibility is that the abundance differences are due to or\ninfluenced by the orbital dynamics of the system. There may be a very stellar distant companion to\nWASP-94A or -94B, which would not have formed out of the\nprotoplanetary disk and thus be undetectable in the abundance\nsignatures, nor detectable in the limited RV coverage ($\\sim$2 years). We are\nconducting high-contrast imaging observations to search for any such\nwide, massive perturbers, which may or may not be bound to either star, that could provide clues to the dynamical history of this system.\n\nIt may be that the small differences that have been observed\nin the high-precision \nabundances of planet-host stars are not related to planet\nformation. \\\"{O}nehag et al. (2011) suggest that the Sun's peculiar\nabundance trend with $T_c$ is not due to small planet formation, but removal\nof refractory dust material early on in the Sun's life. They applied a strictly differential\n(versus the Sun)\napproach to M67-1194, a solar twin in the M67 open cluster, to\nminimize systematic errors and determined not only that its parameters\nare indistinguishable from the Sun (except for [Fe/H]= 0.023$\\pm$0.015\ndex), but also that its abundance pattern very closely resembles the\nSun, unlike the solar twins in Mel\\'endez et al. (2009). The authors\nsuggest that M67-1194 and the Sun may be from the same cluster, or at\nleast that the Sun was born in a cluster similar to M67, and that both\nstars were affected during\ntheir fully-convective phase by dust cleansing by luminous stars in\nthe same cluster. In \\\"{O}nehag, Gustafsson, \\& Korn (2014), the authors\nexpand their sample to 14 M67 stars and find a similar agreement\nbetween the stars' abundances and the Sun's, which they use as further\nsupport for their hypothesis of dust cleansing in both protostellar\nclouds that formed the M67 stars and the Sun (which are perhaps the\nsame). (We note, however, that Pichardo et al. (2012) present strong\ndynamical arguments that reject M67 as a parent cluster of the Sun.) Adibekyan et al. (2014) explored a large sample of\nsolar-like stars and found possible correlations between the\n$\\Delta$[X/H] vs. $T_c$ slopes and stellar ages, and between the\nslopes and mean galactocentric distance. The authors thus suggest that\ndifferences in $\\Delta$[X/H] vs. $T_c$ slopes may not be related to\nplanet formation at all, but instead to the age and galactic birth\nplace of a given star (see, however, Spina et al. 2015). Gaidos (2015) pointed out that the trend of\nincreasing $\\Delta$[X/H] with $T_c$ seen in Mel\\'endez et al. (2009) is the\nopposite of the pattern of element depletion in interstellar medium\n(ISM) gas (Yin 2005), and suggested that it may simply be a signature of\ngas-dust segregation and the particular composition of the dust in the\nprotoplanetary disk. Unfortunately, none of the above explanations \ncan naturally explain the differences reported here between WASP-94A\nand B if the assumption that they formed from the same gas cloud and\nare coeval holds. \n\nFinally, the $\\Delta$[X/H] values we\nmeasure may be due to the different rotation or granulation in\nWASP-94A versus -94B. NV14 measured $v$sin$i$ of 4.2 km~s$^{-1}$ for\nWASP-94A and $<$1.5 km~s$^{-1}$ for WASP-94B; while rotational\nbroadening will not affect the total absorption (measured EW) of an individual line, rotational broadening can make blends\nharder to exclude. The iron line list used here, from Ram\\'irez et\nal. (2014), was constructed specifically to exclude blended lines, but\nthey are not always avoidable for other elements if there are\nonly a few observable lines. In such cases (of\nwhich there are only a few; most elements measured have more than a few lines),\nwe are careful to choose the same continuum and line boundaries in\nboth stars such that the blended feature does not influence the EW\nfit. NV14 also used the cross-correlation function (CCF)\nbisector spans, measured as part of their radial velocity analysis, to\nconfirm the planetary nature of WASP-94Ab and -94Bb, and found a\n$\\sim$25 m~s$^{-1}$ difference in the average CCF bisector values\nbetween the two stars (see their Figures 2 \\& 4). Line bisectors --\nthe midpoints of the horizontal segments across the wings of a\nspectral line -- are a diagnostic of granulation in stellar\natmospheres. However, NV14 do not measure the bisector of spectral\nlines, but the CCF. \n\nAlso, the 25 m~s$^{-1}$ (A-B) difference is an\norder of magnitude smaller than the absolute bisector span measured in\nT$_{eff} \\sim$6000 K stars (e.g., Ram\\'irez et al. 2008), which is\nalready below the resolution of our spectra where the lines have\nbeen smoothed to be almost Gaussian. Thus, the CCF bisector span\ndifferences between WASP-94A and -94B are likely not meaningful to our\ndifferential abundance analysis. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nHere we report differences in the abundances of two hot Jupiter\nhosting F-type stars that are in a wide ($\\sim$2700 AU) separation\nbinary. The stars are ``twins'', with an (A-B) $\\Delta$T$_{eff}=$82$\\pm$7 K,\n$\\Delta$log $g=$-0.08$\\pm$0.019 dex, $\\Delta$[Fe/H]$=$0.014$\\pm$0.006 dex, and\n$\\Delta \\xi=$0.12$\\pm$0.014 km~s$^{-1}$. The abundance analysis presented here\nis strictly differential, allowing a minimization of systematic\nerrors, and includes the average across three independent equivalent width measurement\nsets, further reducing observational errors. One tangible result of this work is the reduction in age of the host\nstars by at least 1 Gyr. As a result of our\ncareful stellar parameter determination, we could pinpoint the\nisochrone on which both WASP-94A and -94B fell, based on their\nrespective $T_{eff}$s and log $g$s. This results in an age between 2.3\nand 2.8 Gyr (not including measurement error of a few tenths of a\nGyr), depending on the isochrone used, which is significantly younger than the $\\sim$4 Gyr age reported in NV14.\n\n\nWe find evidence of a\nnon-zero slope trend between $\\Delta$[X/H] vs. $T_c$ at the 10$\\sigma$\nlevel, with volatile element depletion (by $\\sim$-0.02 dex, on average) and\nrefractory element enhancement (by $\\sim$0.01 dex, on average) in\nWASP-94A. This differs from all other stellar abundance studies of binary systems in\nwhich one or both stars host planets, and does not seem to match any previous\nexplanations of such trends, due to the mass and orbital period\ndifferences between WASP-94Ab and -94Bb. While there is not an obvious\nexplanation for these abundance differences right now, the precision achieved here, at the\n$\\sim$0.005 dex level, allows us to examine differences that may have\nbeen effectively washed out in previous studies of binary stars, which\nsuggested that anywhere from $\\lesssim$0.015 dex to $\\lesssim$0.03 dex\ndifferences were to be expected. \n\n\nWhatever the cause, the abundance differences detected here for\nWASP-94AB, along with those seen in 16 CygAB and XO-2AB, challenge the\nlong-standing assumption that stars in binary systems must share the\nsame chemical composition at all times. The stars may have formed from a single\ncomposition cloud, but processes that occurred after their birth have\ncertainly altered their surface compositions at the few percent\nlevel. A larger sample of ``twin'' systems\nwith constraints on planet presence is necessary to better understand\nhow curious the WASP-94AB system is or not. \n\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank David Lambert for helpful\ncomments that improved the quality of the paper.

Assuming the stars formed in the\nsame environment/from the same material, any compositional anomalies\nbetween binary components might indicate differences in how\nmaterial was sequestered in planets, or accreted by the star in the\nprocess of planet formation. We present here a study of the elemental abundance\ndifferences between WASP-94AB, a pair of stars that each host a hot Jupiter exoplanet. The two stars are very similar in\nspectral type (F8 and F9), and their $\\sim$2700 AU separation suggests their\nprotoplanetary disks were likely not influenced by stellar\ninteractions, but WASP-94Ab's orbit -- misaligned with the host star\nspin axis and likely retrograde -- points towards a\ndynamically active formation mechanism, perhaps different than that of\nWASP-94Bb, which is not misaligned and has nearly circular orbit. Based on our\nhigh-quality spectra and strictly relative abundance analysis, we\ndetect a depletion of volatiles ($\\sim$-0.02 dex, on average) and enhancement of\nrefractories ($\\sim$0.01 dex) in\nWASP-94A relative to B (standard errors are $\\sim$0.005 dex). This is different than every other published\ncase of binary host star abundances, in which either no significant\nabundance differences are reported, or there is some degree of enhancement in\nall elements, including volatiles. Several scenarios that may explain\nthe abundance trend are discussed, but none can be definitively accepted or\nrejected. Additional high-contrast imaging observations to search for\ncompanions that may be dynamically affecting the system, as well as a\nlarger sample of binary host star studies, are needed to\nbetter understand the curious abundance trends we observe in WASP-94AB.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{planets and satellites: formation --- planets and satellites: individual (WASP-94) --- stars: abundances --- stars: atmospheres}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nIn the study of exoplanets, host star composition is of interest\nbecause it may serve as a proxy for planetary\ncomposition. Early on, this connection was viewed from a\n``star-centric'' perspective -- how does the\nformation and evolution of planets change the original, pre-planet\ncomposition of stars? Subsequently, once the correlation between the presence of\ngiant planets and host star metallicity was established as primordial\n(e.g., Santos et\nal.\\,2004; Fischer \\& Valenti 2005), a more ``planet-centric'' perspective was adopted -- how does host star\ncomposition influence the type of planets that form? While many\ninvestigations have focused on the latter perspective, seeking to\nexpand upon the observed giant planet-metallicity correlation (e.g., Sousa et al. 2008; \nGhezzi et al. 2010; Adibekyan et al. 2012; Everett et al. 2013; da\nSilva et al. 2015; Buchhave \\& Latham 2015), a new growing body of work aims\nto revist the ``star-centric'' perspective by examining differences\nbetween very similar stars that do/do not host known planets (e.g.,\nMel\\'endez et al. 2009; Schuler et al. 2011b; Ram\\'irez et al.\\,2011; Ram\\'irez et al. 2014; Tucci Maia\net al. 2014; Liu et al. 2014; Nissen 2015; Saffe et al. 2015), or that\nare known to host different types of planets (Mack et al. 2014; Teske\net al. 2013, 2015; Ram\\'irez et al. 2015). \n\nMeasuring stellar abundances with enough precision to detect\ndifferences that may be due to planets formation is extremely\nchallenging. Mel\\'endez et al. (2009) suggested that their measured\n$\\sim$20\\% deficit of refractory elements (condensation temperatures $T_c\\gtrsim$ 1000\nK) in the Sun versus other ``solar twins'' of similar T$_{eff}$, log $g$,\nand [Fe/H]\\footnote{[X/H]=log(N$_{\\rm{X}}$/N$_{\\rm{H}}$) - log\n  (N$_{\\rm{X}}$/N$_{\\rm{H}}$)$_{\\rm{solar}}$} was due to the formation\nof terrestrial planets in our Solar System. This result hinged on\nabundance errors of 0.01 dex or less, a level of precision made\npossible only by studying ``twin'' stars in a strictly differential\nanalysis, using high resolution ($R \\gtrsim$ 50,000), high\nsignal-to-noise ($\\gtrsim$ 400) spectra. The results of Mel\\'endez et al. (2009) have been both\nquestioned (e.g., Schuler et al. 2011a; Gonz\\'alez Hern\\'andez et al.\\,2010, 2013; Adibekyan et\nal. 2014; Gaidos 2015) and replicated (e.g., Ram\\'irez et\nal.\\, 2009, 2010; Nissen 2015); the interpretation will likely remain\nsuspect until a larger sample of planet host stars is\nexamined in similar detail. However, the potential knowledge gained from\nmeasuring ``missing'' or ``added'' material to host stars is great -- for most exoplanets, now and in the near\nfuture, we will only know their orbital period and their mass or\nradius, meager information from which to deduce a\ncomposition. The power of studying host star compositions to learn\nabout their orbiting planets is already\ndemonstrated by higher stellar metallicities being indicative of\nhigher probabilities of giant planet detections. \n\n\n\nBinary stars are particularly useful for studying differences in\nstellar composition that may be related to the formation of planets. Like the classic experimental\nsetup, if one star in a binary system is known to host a planet and the other is not,\nthe star without a detected planet serves as the ``control'', a relic of the\nprimordial composition of the system (assuming the stars formed in the\nsame environment/from the same material) and is unlikely to be influenced by different\nGalactic chemical evolution (Adibekyan et al. 2014) or by peculiar environment\neffects like supernovae pollution or dust depletion by nearby hot\nstars (\\\"{O}nehag et al. 2011). Studying\n``twin'' stars ($\\Delta T_{eff} \\lesssim 100, \\Delta$log $g \\lesssim 0.1$) allows very\nprecise relative abundance measurements, as systematic uncertainties that\nusually dominate abundance analyses are so similar that they\nessentially cancel out. The remaining observational noise can then be pushed down\nwith very high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra. \nAny observed differences in\ncomposition between the binary components then \\textit{could} be related to\nplanet formation. Work by Desidera et al. (2004; 2006) on a large\nsurvey of wide binaries suggested that [Fe/H] differences between\nbinary stars $\\geq$0.03 are\natypical. Gratton et al. (2001) found that four out of six wide\nbinaries had indistinguishable abundances (at the $\\leq$0.012 dex level) in elements ranging from\n$T_c \\sim 100$ to 1700 K. However, in these\nprevious works the binaries were not always composed of ``twins'', and the\ndata were not always high signal-to-noise ($\\gtrsim 200$). More recent work on the true\n``twin'' system XO-2 suggests that differences in stellar abundances\nas small as 0.015 dex could be due to a\ndifferent type of planet formation around one star versus the other\n(Ram\\'irez et al. 2015; see also Teske et\nal. 2015, Biazzo et al. 2015). Even this small difference amounts to\n$\\sim$0.57M$_J$ of volatile-rich material potentially ``missing''\nfrom XO-2S, instead locked up in its two gas giant planets. Mel\\'endez et al. (2009)'s\n$\\sim$0.08 dex difference in refractory element abundance between the\nSun and 11 solar twins corresponds to $\\sim$4M$_{\\odot}$ of rocky material, which the authors\nequate to the material contained within the Solar System terrestrial planets (Chambers 2010).\n\nIn an effort to further understand how planets affect/are affected by\ntheir host star composition, here we expand the sample of well-studied\n``twin'' binary host systems, performing a high-precision compositional analysis of WASP-94AB, in which both stars are known to host a single close-in giant planet.\n\n\\section{The WASP-94 System}\n\nThe planets in the WASP-94AB system were first reported by\nNeveu-VanMalle et al. (2014; NV14), identified through the WASP-South\ntransiting planet detection program (Hellier et al. 2011). The binary\nconsists of a $V$=10.1, F8V primary, separated by 15$\\arcsec$ from the\n$V$=10.5, F9V secondary. The consistent proper motions, radial\nvelocities of the stars, and little\nchange over time of the position angle or separation (as described in\nNV14) indicate that the components are likely\nbound. From the measured absolute magnitudes, NV14 estimate the\nprojected separation between WASP-94A and B to be $\\geq$2700 AU. The\nprimary star hosts a transiting 0.45 M$_J$, 1.72 R$_J$ planet at 0.055 AU, while the secondary hosts a\nnon-transiting planet at 0.034 AU with a minimum mass $M_P~sini$ of\n0.62 M$_J$. A combined analysis of WASP-94Ab transit and radial\nvelocity data limits an eccentricity $e < 0.13$ at the 3$\\sigma$\nlevel, but the orbit of the planet is obviously misaligned with the\nstellar rotation axis, and is probably retrograde ($\\lambda=~151^{\\circ}\n\\pm 20^{\\circ}$). NV14 assumes a circular orbit for WASP-94Bb, as the\nerror on the fitted $e$ is larger than the value itself, and their\nunsuccessful search for a transit of the planet provides an estimate\nof the inclination of WASP-94Bb's orbital plane of $i\n\\lesssim$79$^{\\circ}$. \n\nWASP-94AB is one of only three known resolvable\\footnote{Kepler-132 is\n  a stellar binary that hosts three small planets, but due to the\n  small angular separation it is unknown\n  around which star the planets orbit (Lissauer et al. 2014). See also\nDeacon et al. (2015).} stellar\n``twin'' systems in which \\textit{both}\nstars host planets (in S type orbits, i.e., not orbiting both\nstars). The HD20782/20781 binary, a G1.5V/G9.5V\npair separated by $\\sim$9000 AU, is actually on the border of the colloquial ``twin'' regime, with a\n$\\Delta$T$_{eff} \\sim 500$ K and $\\Delta$log $g \\sim$0.10 dex. The primary hosts a 1.9 M$_J$, 1.4 AU, $e\n\\sim$0.97 planet and the secondary hosts a 0.04 M$_J$, 0.17 AU, $e\n\\sim 0.11$ planet and a 0.05 M$_J$, 0.35 AU, $e \\sim 0.28$\nplanet; all three of the planets were detected via radial\nvelocity (Jones et al. 2006; Mayor et al. 2011).\nMack et al. (2014) found no significant abundance differences\nbetween the HD20782/20781 stars, but reported errors between 0.02-0.07\ndex. The other known dual-hosting binary is\nXO-2NS, a $\\sim$4600 AU-separated pair of $\\sim$0.97 M$_{\\odot}$ stars\nthat are more ``twin''-like, with $\\Delta$T$_{eff} \\sim$60 K,\n$\\Delta$log $g \\sim$0.02 dex, and $\\Delta$[Fe/H]$\\sim$0.06 dex\n(Biazzo et al. 2015; Ram\\'irez et al. 2015; Teske et al. 2015; Damasso\net al. 2015; Desidera et al. 2014). XO-2N hosts a transiting planet\nwith 0.62 M$_J$ at 0.04 AU (assumed $e=0$; Burke et al. 2007), and\nXO-2S hosts two radial-velocity-detected planets, with masses 0.26\nM$_J$ and 1.37 M$_J$, orbital separations 0.13 and 0.48 AU, and $e\n\\sim$0.18 and 0.15, respectively (Desidera et al. 2014; Damasso et\nal. 2015). \n\nThus, WASP-94 differs from HD20782/20781 and XO-2 in a few important\nways: \n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The binary separation is smaller, at 2700 AU versus 4600 AU (XO-2)\n  and 9000 AU (HD20782/20781).\n\n\\item The stars are hotter and more massive, meaning their convective\n  envelopes are smaller, and changes due to planet formation may be\n  easier to detect. \n\n\\item Both stars are known to host a single low-eccentricity, close-in\n  ($<$0.06 AU) gas giant planets, versus higher-eccentricity/longer-orbit/multiple\n  planets.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\noindent WASP-94 is of particular interest because hot Jupiter planets (roughly\ndefined as $M_P~sini >0.1 M_J$ and P$<$10 days) are rare,\nfound around $\\lesssim$1\\% of FGK dwarfs (Wright et al. 2012,\nTable 2). The planets in this system must have migrated inward, but\nwhat triggered their (and other hot Jupiter) period shrinkage is an open question, as \nthere are several proposed mechanism(s) for giant planet migration in a\nprotoplanetary disk (e.g., Goldreich \\& Tremaine 1980; Wu \\& Murray 2003;\nNaoz et al. 2011; Rasio \\& Ford 1996; Wu \\& Lithwick 2011; Guillochon\net al. 2011). Furthermore, while both planets likely\nhave near zero eccentricities, WASP-94Ab has a misaligned and probably\nretrograde orbit, WASP-94Bb's orbit is inclined relative to Ab, and\n(comparing age-based periods with periods computed via $v~sini$)\nWASP-94B (the star) may be inclined by $>$60$^{\\circ}$ with respect to WASP-94A (NV14). This system is an\nexceptional laboratory for studying the formation and dynamical evolution of hot Jupiter exoplanets via\nchanges they may have induced in their host stars. \n\n\\section{Spectroscopic Observations and Analysis}\n\n\nObservations of WASP-94AB were acquired on 1 May 2015 (UT) with\nthe MIKE high resolution spectrograph (Bernstein et al. 2003) on the\n6.5m Clay Magellan Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. The standard\nMIKE setup was used with a 0.5$\\arcsec$ slit, providing\n$\\sim$320-1000nm wavelength coverage and $R \\sim$45,000. Multiple exposures were taken of each star and added\ntogether during the reduction process to achieve a peak $S/N$ at\n6000 {\\AA} of $\\sim$500 for WASP-94A and $\\sim$400 for WASP-94B. The\nspectra were reduced with the CarnegiePython MIKE pipeline\n\\footnote{http://code.obs.carnegiescience.edu/mike}, then\nvelocity-corrected and combined with IRAF\\footnote{IRAF is distributed\n  by the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by\n  the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA)\n  under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.} following the\nprocedure described in Ram\\'irez et al. (2014). \n\nThe stellar parameters and abundances detailed below were derived from\nequivalent width (EW) measurements -- fitting Gaussian functions to\nobserved line profiles with IRAF's \\texttt{splot} task -- of spectral lines, unless otherwise\nnoted. The line list was taken from Ram\\'irez et al. (2014), which\nincludes Fe I lines covering a wide range of excitation potentials and\n$\\sim$20 Fe II lines. This line list was selected to include only\nlines with strengths low enough to be on the linear part of the curve\nof growth, and to exclude blended lines or those in low S/N parts of\nthe spectrum. We performed independent measurements of\neach line (Table \\ref{lines}) using \\texttt{splot} in IRAF, and the resulting abundances were\naveraged together for the final reported values. Independent\nmeasurements of the stars were performed after initial measurements\nsuggested the $\\Delta$[X/H] differences were very small and barely\ndetectable with only one set of EW measurements. Since the stars are ``twins'', the errors in $\\Delta$[X/H]\ncan be reduced by minimizing the observational noise, some of which\ncomes from the precise way in which each person decides to measure\nEWs (e.g., the continuum placement). Combining the EWs instead of the\nderived parameters would have led to larger errors due to the\nsystematics between EW sets. The solar reference EW\nmeasurements are also from Ram\\'irez et al. (2014). \n\n\nThe EW measurements were translated into elemental abundances using\nthe curve-of-growth method via the 2014 version of the spectral analysis code MOOG (Sneden\n1973), specifically the \\texttt{abfind} driver, and ``standard composition'' MARCS 1D-LTE stellar atmosphere\nmodels (Gustafsson et al. 2008), linearly interpolated to the\nappropriate stellar parameters. This is the third paper to utilize the\npublicly-available \\texttt{Qoyllur-quipu}\n($q^2$) Python package\\footnote{https://github.com/astroChasqui/q2},\na MOOG wrapper that uses EWs as input to derive stellar parameters and\nabundances. Given the measured EWs in Table \\ref{lines}, the results\npresented here can be fully reproduced with $q^2$.\n\n\n\\subsection{Stellar Parameters}\n\nFundamental stellar parameters $T_{eff}$ (effective temperature), log\n$g$ (surface gravity), [Fe/H] (iron abundance), and $\\xi$\n(microturbulent velocity) were determined from a traditional\nequilibrium/ionization balance. In this method, the differences in Fe\nI and Fe II abundances are compared to the excitation potential and reduced equivalent width ($REW$ =\nlog $EW/\\lambda$) in a line-by-line manner to minimize any\ncorrelations. The abundances of Fe I and Fe II depend on the input\nstellar model, which is iteratively modified (in $T_{eff}$, log $g$,\n[Fe/H], and $\\xi$) until the\nexcitation/ionization balance conditions are reached. The details of\nthis procedure are described in Ram\\'irez et al. (2014) and Teske et\nal. (2014). Here, we employ the formal error determination of\nRam\\'irez et al. (2014), which propagates both the measurement errors\n(line-by-line variation in abundances) and uncertainties in the\nderived stellar parameters (Epstein et al. 2010; Bensby et\nal. 2014). In each case described below, we derived parameters from\neach independent set of EW measurements, and the reported values are\nthe mean $\\pm$ the error on the mean\\footnote{Defined as\n  $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{n=3} x_{err}^2}{n}}$, where $x_{err}$= the\n  error on each independently-derived parameter}. \n\n\n\nWe first determined WASP-94A and -94B stellar parameters differentially with\nrespect to the Sun, assuming a solar $T_{eff}=$5777 K, log\n$g=$4.44 dex, [Fe/H]=0, and $\\xi=$1.00 km s$^{-1}$. The resulting\nparameters and errors for each star are given in Table \\ref{params}, as are the\noriginally published parameters and errors from NV14. We find slightly\nhigher values for $T_{eff}$, log $g$, and [Fe/H] than NV14 (see\nsecond section Table \\ref{params}), but our results\noverlap within errors in every case except log $g$ for WASP-94B, where\nthe difference including errors is 0.04 dex. \n\nUnlike the solar twins in Mel\\'endez et al. (2009), it is clear that WASP-94AB\nare significantly different than Sun in $T_{eff}$, log $g$, and\n[Fe/H]. Our solar spectra were obtained with the same instrument and\nsetup, but not on the same night, which is not ideal. Furthermore,\nthere may be small differences in the Galactic chemical evolution of the Sun versus WASP-94AB (which has space\nmotions consistent with young disk stars, and is 180$\\pm$20 pc\naway). Thus, we can obtain more precise parameters by comparing the\ntwo stars differentially to each other; the differences between the\ntwo stars are the desired quantities, not how they compare to the\nSun. We assume the parameters\nderived above for WASP-94B as fixed, since it is closer in its parameters to\nsolar and thus the Sun-relative analysis is more reliable than for\n-94A, and proceed to measure only the relative parameters for WASP-94A. These\nresults are listed in the third section of Table \\ref{params}; the\nWASP-94A parameters change little from our Solar Reference case, but\nthe errors are $\\sim$halved. These strictly (A-B) differential values result in $\\Delta T_{eff}$,\n$\\Delta$log $g$, and $\\Delta$[Fe/H] values that overlap with the \n$\\Delta$(A-B) parameter differences from NV14 (see third lines of each section\nof Table \\ref{params}). \n\nWe performed several additional tests to check whether the assumed\nSun-relative parameters for WASP-94B were indeed reliable. For\n$T_{eff}$, we used the [Fe/H] values from Table \\ref{params} (this\nwork, Solar Reference) in the Casagrande et al. (2010) effective\ntemperature-color calibration for ($V-J$), ($V-K$), ($V-H$), and\n($J-K$), with $V$ as given in NV14 with assumed errors of 0.05 mag,\nand $JHK_s$ as given on \\texttt{Simbad}. The average resulting $T_{eff}$\nvalues are 6216$\\pm$91 K for WASP-94A and 6096$\\pm$79 K for WASP-94B,\nwhich are consistent with the Sun-relative parameters albeit with\nlarger errors. As another test of precise $T_{eff}$s, we matched via\n$\\chi^2$ minimization the observed\nH$\\alpha$ Balmer lines with model fits from the theoretical grid of\nH$\\alpha$ lines from Barklem et al. (2002), in a process detailed in\nRam\\'irez et al. (2014b) that includes a non-standard 2D-normalization\nof the CCD region around the line. This analysis (see Fig. \\ref{halpha}) resulted in best-fit\n$T_{eff}$s of 6201$\\pm$25 K for WASP-94A and 6121$\\pm$30 K for\nWASP-94B, after applying the necessary $+$46 K offset necessary to\nmake the H$\\alpha$ temperatures from the solar spectra match the\nnominal solar $T_{eff}$ of 5777 K (as derived in Ram\\'irez et\nal. 2014b). The H$\\alpha$ effective temperatures are even closer to\nthe values obtained from the A-B analysis described above (see Table\n\\ref{params}, This work, WASP-94B Reference), including the\n$\\Delta~T_{eff}$ (80 K from H$\\alpha$ versus 86 K from A-B analysis).\n\nWith confirmation of the $T_{eff}$ values derived in the A-B\ndifferential analysis, the derived log $g$ values can be checked\nagainst theoretical isochrones; if the stars are bound and coeval, their ages\nshould be consistent. In Figure \\ref{iso}, the A-B parameters are\nplotted against Yonsei-Yale and Padova isochrones, and it is clear\nthat the A-B log $g$ values result in different ages for the two\nstars (green open circles). However, if we assume that the surface gravities\nof both stars are 0.08 dex less (blue filled circles), then the stars both fall\nnicely on the 2.3 or 2.4 Gyr Yonsei-Yale isochrone (solid blue\nlines; both are consistent with 2.4 Gyr within errors). Thus, we fixed\nthe log $g$ of WASP-94B to 4.30 dex, rather than 4.38 dex as\noriginally determined relative to the Sun, and rederived the relative\nWASP-94A stellar parameters for each set of EW measurements. This\nresulted in very small changes in the other derived stellar parameters of WASP-94A\n(see Table \\ref{params}, This work, WASP-94B Reference, Isochrone Log\n$g$). Given the lower log $g$ values are more consistent with the same\nage for both stars, these are used in the subsequent elemental\nabundance analysis. Lowering the log $g$ values by 0.08\n(B)/0.09 (A) dex did not result in changes to the elemental abundance\nratios (detailed in the next section) outside\nthe original errors derived from the higher log $g$ values. \n\nThe isochrone analysis presented here indicates that the stars have an\nage of $\\sim$2.5 Gyr (with an error of a few tenths of a Gyr),\nsignificantly younger than the age reported in NV14, $\\sim$4 Gyr. The\nbest matching age based on the Yonsei-Yale isochrones in Figure\n\\ref{iso} (blue solid lines) is 2.3-2.4 Gyr, whereas the best matching\nage based on the Padova isochrones is more like 2.8 Gyr, still\nsignificantly younger than the 4 Gyr age reported in NV14.\n\n\\subsection{Elemental Abundances}\n\nWith knowledge of the environment in which spectral lines form, we can\ntranslate EW measurements of other elements into abundances via a\ncurve-of-growth analysis within MOOG. The EWs of lines measured in the\nSun, WASP-94A, and WASP-94B corresponding\nto 23 elements, including Fe, are listed in Table \\ref{lines}. Our\nprocedure for measuring EWs in WASP-94A and -94B included a direct\ncomparison in the normalized and Doppler-corrected spectra of every\nline. This allowed us to choose a continuum region that was the same in\nboth spectra, reducing potential systematic error, and check for\ndifferences in the lines that may affect the upper and lower limits of\nthe EW fit (e.g., if we want to avoid a blend). Carbon\nabundances were measured from both C I and CH lines, and for Sc, Ti,\nand Cr lines from both neutral and singly-ionized species were\nmeasured (in addition to Fe). Hyperfine structure corrections were employed for V, Mn, Co,\nCu, Rb, Y, and Ba, and we applied the O triplet non-LTE corrections from\nRam\\'irez et al. (2007). \nThe relative abundances obtained from a line-by-line analysis, averaged\nover three independent EW measurements, are listed in Table \\ref{abuns},\nalong with errors that add in quadrature both the line-to-line scatter\n($\\sigma/\\sqrt{n-1}$) as well as the errors propagated from each\nparameter uncertainty. For species with only one line (K I, Zr II), we\nadopted the largest line-to-line scatter for species with more than\nthree lines available, within each set of independent EW measurements\n(the value of the largest line-to-line scatter was different for each of the \nmeasurement sets). \n\nThe NLTE corrections to the O I triplet line around 7775 {\\AA} are\nuncertain, and several different groups have published\ncorrections. While our strictly differential approach between the two\n``twin'' star should help eliminate uncertainty in the $\\Delta$[O/H]\nvalues, we checked our results by performing a synthesis analysis of\nthe [O I] line at 6300 {\\AA} using the MOOG \\texttt{synth} driver, as\noutlined in Teske et al. (2014), \\S 3.1.1. The synthesis fitting of\nWASP-94A yielded absolute oxygen abundances (log$N$(O)) of 9.01-9.03, while fitting\nof WASP-94B yielded log$N$(O) values of 8.98-9.02, confirming a small\npositive $\\Delta$[O/H] for (A-B) that is represented by our reported\nerror (0.006 dex). We also confirmed our negative $\\Delta$[C/H] value\nby synthesis fitting two blended C$_2$ molecular features at 5086.3 {\\AA}  and\n5135.6 {\\AA}  via the process outlined in Teske et al. (2013), \\S\n2.3.1. The fitted log$N$(C) of WASP-94A ranged from 8.63-8.65, and\nfrom 8.66-8.68 for WASP-94B, resulting in $\\Delta$[C/H] (A-B) values between\n-0.05 and -0.02, within our reported errors for\n$\\Delta$[C/H]. Importantly, we confirm that the $\\Delta$[C/H] value is certainly below\nthe zero line. \n\nNV14 reported Li abundances log $N$(Li)$_{A}=$2.10$\\pm$0.07 and log\n$N$(Li)$_{B}$ $\\leq$1.20. They propose that the WASP-94 stars have\nalready undergone magnetic breaking and Li depletion due to their low\nlog$N$(Li) and $v$sin$i$ values. We confirm the low log$N$(Li)\nabundances in WASP-94AB, and a significant (A-B) difference, based on a synthesis analysis of the 6707.8 {\\AA}  doublet using\nthe line list of Mandell, Ge \\& Murray (2004). Our synthesis fitting suggests\nWASP-94A's log$N$(Li)$=$2.01-2.04 and WASP-94B's log$N$(Li)$\\leq$1.62,\nresulting in a $\\Delta$log$N$(Li)$\\geq$0.39. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral\nauthors have suggested that the formation of planets could\nenhance lithium depletion in host star photospheres (Gonzalez 2008, 2014;\nIsraelian et al. 2009; Figueira et al. 2014; Delgado Mena et al. 2015) due to\nplanetary migration (Castro et al. 2008), and/or star-disk\ninteractions (e.g., Bouvier 2008), but there\nis not yet consensus due to selection biases in planet host samples\nand large lithium abundance uncertainties (e.g., Ghezzi et al. 2010;\nBaumann et al. 2010; Ram\\'irez et\nal. 2012). Both WASP-94 stars border the ``lithium desert'' proposed\nby Ram\\'irez et al. (2012), a region in $T_{eff}$ versus log$N$(Li)\nspace devoid of stars. Indeed, there are no exoplanet host stars included in Ram\\'irez et al. (2012) with as low\nlog$N$(Li) and as high $T_{eff}$ and [Fe/H] as WASP-94B (see their\nFigure 9), making WASP-94B a slightly unusual case. The star's relatively low log$N$(Li) suggests\nit may have experienced some short-lived surface destruction of\nlithium. Here we do not focus on the study of lithium, but the\ndifference between WASP-94A and -94B, a pair of hot ``twin'' stars\nboth hosting close-in giant planets, could prove to be a powerful tool\nfor better understanding whether there is a connection between lithium\ndepletion in stars and the presence of planets. \n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\subsection{Results: $\\Delta$[X/H] vs. $T_c$}\nIn Figure \\ref{key1}, the abundance differences between the two\nstars, $\\Delta$[X/H], are plotted against the 50\\% condensation\ntemperatures ($T_c$) from Lodders (2003) for solar composition\ngas. There is a small but significant (see below) enhancement of high-$T_c$ elements\n($\\geq$1200 K) in WASP-94A relative to -94B. Lodders (2003) refers to\nphosphorous at $T_c=1229$ K as ``moderately volatile'', sulfur at\n$T_c=664$ K as ``volatile'', and iron, magnesium, and silicon\n($T_c=1334, 1529, 1397$ K, resp.) as ``common''. As in other studies\nlooking for correlations between abundance differences and\ncondensation temperature, the $T_c$ values we\nuse here are for a solar-composition gas. However, $T_c$ values will\ndepend on the composition of the gas, which in the case of WASP-94AB\nis super-solar. Detailed chemical equilibrium condensation sequence calculations\nsuch as those in Bond et al. (2010) are beyond the scope of this work, but the sequences calculated in\nthat work for gas of similar composition to WASP-94AB indicate $T_c$\nvalues do not increase more than a few tens of K. Even in\nthe high-metallicity condensation sequences where $T_c$ for C and O\nincrease by up to about 1000 K, this would not affect our overall\nresults because our ``break'' between volatiles and refractories is\nlikely higher than $\\sim$1000 K (see below). Most of the lower\n$T_c$ volatile or moderately volatile elements are depleted in\nWASP-94A, save sodium (Na) and potassium (K). The latter is based on\none saturated line that suffers from a large NLTE effect ($\\sim$0.3\ndex; e.g., de La Reza and M{\\\"u}ller 1975; Zhang et al. 2006); this\nabundance may thus not be very accurate.\nIn an attempt to\nameliorate the high $\\Delta$[Na/H] value, as well as check for\nsystematic error, the elemental abundance derivation was\nrepeated across all elements, removing any potentially-saturated lines with EW values\n$>$100 m{\\AA}. The resulting values are shown in \nFigure \\ref{key2}, with K and O unchanged, as their abundances\nare based on only strong lines. None of the new abundance derivations\nthat exclude strong\nlines change within the errors, \\textit{except} for Na, which\nis exactly zero when two \nstrong lines are removed from the\naverage; removing these lines also reduces the line-to-line scatter, slightly\ndecreasing the $\\Delta$[Na/H] error. \n\n\\subsubsection{Linear 1- and 2-Component Fits}\nExamining the new abundances in Figure \\ref{key2} and excluding\nK, there appears to be a natural break point around $T_c=1200$ K,\nbetween Mn and Cr, although with moderate scatter ($\\sigma$ of all\n$\\Delta$[X/H]$=$0.02 dex). The $\\chi^2$ value\\footnote{$\\chi^2 =\n  \\sum$[(observed-predicted)$^{2}$/error$_{\\rm{observed}}$]} of a simple\nzero-slope, zero-intercept fit (the dashed green line in Figure \\ref{key2}) is 1.48. A weighted\\footnote{by 1/$\\Delta[X/H]_{err}^2$} linear fit to the data with a forced-zero\nslope but a free intercept results in an intercept$=0.0055 \\pm 0.0010$ dex, and a\n$\\chi^2$ value of 1.50, slightly worse than a flat line with intercept$=0$. A\nlinear fit to the data with an unconstrained slope results in an\nintercept of -0.0302$\\pm$0.0037 dex and a slope of\n2.7723$\\pm$0.2795$\\times$10$^{-5}$ dex/K, with a $\\chi^2$ value of\n0.86 and a mean scatter around the fit of -0.0035 dex. The data thus support a non-zero slope at the $\\sim$10$\\sigma$\nlevel. \n\nTo test whether a two-component linear function is favored (results in a\nlower $\\chi^2$ value), we first repeat a linear fit to\nall the points (except $\\Delta$[K/H]), removing the\nhighest-$T_c$ point from each iteration to find the number of points whose linear fit\nresults in the lowest slope value. The slope minimum occurs at\n$T_c=$1158 (Mn). This minimum is then used as $P[2]$ in a custom\nfit, executed with the IDL \\texttt{MPFITFUN} routine (Markwardt 2009), with the functional form $[P[0]+P[1]\\times\nX[0:P[2]],P[3]+P[4]\\times X[P[2]+1,*]]$, where $P[0], P[1], P[3]$ and\n$P[4]$ are allowed to vary, $X$ corresponds to $T_c$, and $*$ is the\nlast entry in $X$. The\nresulting best-fit parameters are $P[0]=$-0.0197$\\pm$0.005 dex,\n$P[1]=$1.463$\\pm$5.996$\\times 10^{-6}$ dex/K,\n$P[3]=$-0.0120$\\pm$0.0114dex and\n$P[4]=$1.615$\\pm$0.795$\\times 10^{-5}$ dex/K. This two component\nlinear fit has a $\\chi^2$ value of 0.71, with a volatile element ($T_c\n< 1200$ K) slope\nconsistent with zero and a refractory element ($T_c >1200$ K) slope\ninconsistent with zero at the 2$\\sigma$ level. This two component fit\nis shown in green in the top panel of Figure \\ref{key2}. The mean\nscatter around this two-component fit is -0.0023 dex, and using $T_c$=1200 K as the divider,\nwe find weighted averages (and weighted standard deviations) of\n$\\Delta$[X/H]=-0.019$\\pm$-0.006 for volatiles (i.e., a deficiency detected at the 3$\\sigma$ level) and $\\Delta$[X/H]=$+$0.011$\\pm$0.002 for refractories (i.e., an enhancement detected at the 5$\\sigma$ level).\n\nAs a second test of the $T_c$ break point, we performed two separate linear fits\nto the measurements, and varied the $T_c$-break temperature (where one fit\nended and the other began) between 500 K and\n1500 K. For each $T_c$-break temperature, we calculated the difference\nbetween the end of the low $T_c$ fit and the beginning of the high\n$T_c$ fit to find the value that resulted in a smooth transition between the two linear\nfits (zero difference between the end/start points). This $T_c$-break\ntemperature is 685 K, much cooler than the 1200 K value found\nabove. In this fit, the lower $T_c$ component has a slope\n1.241$\\pm$4.756$\\times$10$^{-5}$ dex/K and an intercept of\n-0.0247$\\pm$0.0167 dex, while the higher $T_c$ component slope of\n3.829$\\pm$1.233$\\times$10$^{-5}$ dex/K and an intercept of\n-0.0424$\\pm$0.0175 dex. Using $T_c$=685 K as the divider, we find weighted averages (and weighted standard deviations) of\n$\\Delta$[X/H]=-0.022$\\pm$-0.008 for volatiles (i.e., a deficiency detected at\nthe 2$\\sigma$ level) and $\\Delta$[X/H]=$+$0.008$\\pm$0.003 for refractories\n(i.e., an enhancement detected at the 2$\\sigma$ level). However, the resulting fit shown in the bottom panel of\nFigure \\ref{key2} has a $\\chi^2$ of 0.936 and a mean\nscatter around the fit of -0.0053 dex, a slightly worse fit than the\n2-component fit described above with a $T_c$-break point of 1200 K.\n\n\\subsubsection{Nature of Scatter}\n\nWe ran standard statistical tests to address the question of\nwhether the scatter seen in Figure \\ref{key2} is consistent with random\nobservational noise. These tests are independent of the $T_c$\ncorrelation and only examine the level of scatter and its\nnormality. For its use in some of these tests, we created a sample\n``S'' of 100,000 $\\Delta$[X/H] values randomly selected from a\nGaussian distribution of $\\sigma$=0.007 dex, which is the average\nerror bar of our $\\Delta$[X/H] values. A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(KS) test gives a $p$-value of 0.06 when comparing the actual data to\nthe pure noise sample $S$. An Anderson-Darling (AD) test on the same\ntwo samples gives a significance level of 2.5$\\times$10$^{-5}$. We\nrepeated these tests assuming that our error bars had been\nunderestimated and redefined the $S$ sample assuming Gaussian noise of\n$\\sigma$=0.010 dex instead. In this case, we find a much larger KS\n$p$-value of $\\sim$0.4, which would imply that our data could be\ncompatible with no abundance difference within error, but the\nsignificance level from the AD test remains low, at 0.03. The AD\ntest is known to be superior to the KS test for a variety of reasons,\nin particular its higher sensitivity to the edges of the distributions\n(see, e.g., Feigelson \\& Babu 2012, their Sect. 5.3.1). We also\nemployed the AD and Shapiro-Wilk (SW) tests to quantify the\n``normality'' of our $\\Delta$[X/H] data set (these tests do not\nrequire an estimate of the sigma value a priori). In both cases, the\nstatistic derived corresponds to a significance level below 6\\%. In\nother words, the probability that our $\\Delta$[X/H] values correspond\nto a Gaussian distribution centered at zero is low. Despite having\nrelatively few data points, the non-normality of our abudance\ndifferences can be clearly seen in Figure \\ref{stats}. Thus, these statistical tests suggest that there are in fact true\nabundance differences between the stars in the WASP-94 system.\n\nAs noted in \\S 1.1, WASP-94 differs from the other known twin binary\nsystems in which both stars host planets in several important ways. The trend with $\\Delta$[X/H]\nand $T_c$ observed here -- more\nrefractory elements in WASP-94A than B, but fewer volatile elements --\nalso differs from what is observed in the other known twin\nbinary systems, including those in which only one star is known to\nhost a planet. In every other published case, either no significant\nabundance differences are reported, or there is some degree of enhancement in\n\\textit{all} elements, including those with low $T_c$. The pattern\nobserved here in WASP-94AB appears qualitatively similar to that\nreported by some authors in the 16 CygAB system (Ram\\'irez et\nal.\\,2011; Tucci Maia et al. 2014) and reported in the XO-2AB\nsystem (Teske et al. 2015; Ram\\'irez et al.\\,2015; Biazzo et\nal. 2015) -- volatiles have a $\\sim$flat slope, while refractories\nhave a positive slope -- but in WASP-94A the volatiles are depleted,\nnot enhanced like in 16 Cyg A and XO-2N. Additionally, the differences we find here\nbetween WASP-94AB are smaller than those seen in 16 CygAB and XO-2AB,\ncausing the appearance of our Figure \\ref{key2} to be ``noisier'' due\nto the fact that it is ``zoomed in'' more than the previous cases (not\nbecause our errors are larger). Note, for example, that the\nenhancement of refractory element abundances compared to volatiles in\nsolar twins relative to the Sun is about 2-3 times larger than that\nseen in WASP-94 A minus B, as shown by the thin gray line in Figure\n\\ref{key2}. \n\n\n\\subsection{Explanation of Observed Trend}\nWhat could account for the observed trend in $\\Delta$[X/H] abundances?  Ram\\'irez et\nal. (2015) explained the volatile depletion in XO-2S as potentially ``more'' gas\ngiant planet formation around it versus XO-2N, leading to a relatively larger amount of\nvolatile elements in -2N. Similarly, Tucci Maia et al. (2014) suggested the volatile\ndepletion in 16 Cyg B relative to A as was due to the envelope of the giant\nplanet around 16 Cyg B, and the refractory depletion was a signature\nof the rocky core of 16 Cyg Bb. Examining Figure \\ref{key2}, the\nvolatile depletion in A could be explained by (more) giant planet\nformation causing a decrease in its overall metallicity, and thus\nvolatile abundances, relative to B, and (more) rocky planet formation around B\ncausing a decrease in its refractory abundances relative to A. \n\nAlternatively, the observed abundance differences could be explained by the difference in metal content\nof WASP-94Ab and -94Bb, and not any additional planets. Miller \\&\nFortney (2011) compared interior models of 14 cool transiting giant\nplanets to their host stars' [Fe/H] values, and found that the overall\nheavy element mass for planets ($M_z$) increases with planet mass, but that the percentage of metals in\nthe planet versus the percentage of metals in the star ($Z_{pl}/Z_{star}$) decreases with planet mass, consistent\nwith Solar System giant planets. If WASP-94Ab was larger, and thus had\na smaller refractory-to-volatile abundance ratio than WASP-94Bb, then\nWASP-94A might contain less volatile but more refractory material ``left\nbehind'' after the formation if its giant planet. \n\nHowever, both of these explanations are unsupported by the\nplanets actually observed. The planet around WASP-94B\nis more massive, so -94B should be the star to show the lower overall\nmetallicity and volatile abundances, or the higher\nrefractory-to-volatile ratio of ``left over'' material in the star. We can estimate whether the mass\ndifference between WASP-94Ab and -94Bb can even explain the observed\nabundance differences using the corrected formula from Ram\\'irez et\nal.
