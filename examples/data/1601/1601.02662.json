Then, by Lemma \\ref{Lem-2.7}, we have $|f(V)|=|f^{\\cup}(E)|+1$. That is, $|V|=|E|+1$. Therefore, $G$ is a tree. \n\nConversely, assume that $G$ be a tree on $n$ vertices, say $V(G)=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3,\\ldots v_n\\}$. What required is to define a DSL $f$ on $G$ such that $f(V(G))$ is a topology on $X$. For this, let $X=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots, a_{n-1}\\}$. Now, define the function $f:V(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$ such that $f(v_1)=\\emptyset, f(v_2)=\\{a_1\\}, f(v_3)=\\{a_1,a_2\\}, \\ldots, f(v_i)=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots, a_{i-1}\\},\\dots, f(v_n)=X$. Then, we have $f(V)=\\{\\emptyset,\\{a_1\\},\\{a_1,a_2\\},\\ldots,\\\\ \\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots, a_{i-1}\\}, X\\}$, which is clearly a topology on $X$. This completes the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:TDSLG} is an illustration to a DSI-graph, the collection of whose vertex set-labels is a topology on the ground set $X$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{TDSLG}\n\\caption{An illustration to a CSL-Graph.}\n\\label{fig:TDSLG}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nUsing the similar arguments given in the above theorem, the corresponding result for conjunctive set-labeled graphs can be established as follows.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{Thm-2.8a}\nFor a connected CSI-graph $G(V,E)$, the collection $f(V(G))$ is a topology on the ground set $X$ if and only if $G$ is a tree.   \n\\end{thm}\n\nAnother important property of a set-labeling is its gracefulness.

Then, by Theorem \\ref{Thm-2.8}, $G$ is a tree.  Therefore, $|E|=|V|-1$.\n\nMoreover, since $f$ is graceful, we have $|f(V)|=|f^{\\cup}(E)|+1=2^{|X|}$. Therefore, $|f(V)|=|V|$ is even and $|f^{\\cup}(E)|=|E|$ is odd.\n\\end{proof}\n\nThe corresponding results on conjunctive set-indexers of graphs can be stated as follows.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{Prop-2.9a}\nA conjunctive set-indexer of a given graph $G$ is graceful if and only if $f(V)$ is the discrete topology on the ground set $X$.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{cor}\\label{Cor-2.10a}\nA graph $G$ which admits a graceful disjunctive set-indexer has even number of vertices and odd number of edges.\n\\end{cor}\n\nThe proofs of above two results follow in an exactly similar way as that of the corresponding results on DSI-graphs. \n\nThe choice of the ground set plays an important role in defining a DSL and a CSL for given graph classes. Hence, we introduce the following notions.\n\n\\begin{defn}{\\rm \nThe minimum cardinality of the ground set $X$ required for a given graph $G$ to admit a DSI is called the \\textit{disjunctive set-indexing number} of that graph and is denoted by $\\varrho(G)$.}\n\\end{defn}\n\nSimilarly, we can define the notion of the conjunctive set-indexing number of given graphs as follows. \n\n\\begin{defn}{\\rm \nThe minimum cardinality of the ground set $X$ required for a given graph $G$ to admit a CSI is called the \\textit{conjunctive set-indexing number} of that graph and is denoted by $\\varpi(G)$.}\n\\end{defn}  \n\n{\\noindent} The following theorem determines certain bounds for the disjunctive set-indexing number of a graph.\n\n\\begin{thm}\nThe disjunctive set-indexing number of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is  $\\varrho=\\lceil \\log_2n\\rceil$.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices which admits a disjunctive set-indexer $f$ with respect to the ground set $X$.

The problems of establishing the necessary and sufficient conditions for various graphs and graph classes to have certain other types of set valuations are also open. All these facts highlight a wide scope for future studies in this area.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\n\nThe author of this article dedicates this paper to the memory Prof. (Dr.) D.

Unless mentioned otherwise, all graphs considered here are simple, finite, connected and non-trivial.\n\nThe researches on graph labeling problems attracted wide interest among researchers after the introduction of the concept of number valuations of graphs in \\cite{AR1}. Motivated from the problems in social interactions in social networks, a set-analogue of number valuations of graphs, called set-valuations of graphs, has been introduced in \\cite{BDA1}. Since then, a lot of researches have been taken place on both number valuations and set-valuations of graphs.\n\nLet $X$ be a non-empty set and ${\\mathscr{P}}(X)$ be its power set. A {\\em set-valuation} or {\\em set-labeling} of a graph $G$ with respect to $X$ is an injective set-valued function $f:V(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$, whose induced function $f^{\\ast}(uv):E(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$ is defined by $f^{\\ast}(uv)=f(u)\\ast f(v)$,where $\\ast$ is a binary operation on sets. A set-labeling $f$ is said to be a {\\em set- indexer} of $G$ if the induced function $f^{\\ast}$ is also injective. A graph $G$ which admits a set-labeling (or set-indexer) is called an {\\em set-labeled graph} (or {\\em set-indexed graph}). Further fundamental and consequent studies on set-valuations and set-indexers of graphs, can be seen in \\cite{BDA1,BDA2}.\n\nThe binary operation of set-labels used in \\cite{BDA1}, is the symmetric difference $\\oplus$ of sets. Later, the notions of integer additive set-labeling and sumset labeling of graphs have been introduced in \\cite{GA,GS1,GS0}, by using sumset operation of sets instead of symmetric difference of sets, and studies on graphs which admit these types of set-labelings are appeared in subsequent literature.\n\nThe main objective of this paper is to introduce another two types of set-valuations. In which the binary operations are union and intersection of sets. In these types of set-labelings the set labels of edges are the union or intersection of the set labels of their end vertices. We also study certain structural properties of the graphs which admit these types of set-labelings.\n\n\\section{Disjunctive and Conjunctive Set-Labelings of Graphs}\n\n{\\noindent} As a special type of set-labeling of graphs, we introduce the following notion.\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{Defn-2.1}{\\rm \nA {\\em disjunctive set-labeling} (DSL) of a graph $G$ with respect to a non-empty ground set $X$ is an injective set-valued function $f:V(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$, whose induced function $f^{\\cup}:E(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$ is defined by $f^{\\cup}(uv)=f(u)\\cup f(v)$.

The most important and much interesting question in this context is whether all graphs admit disjunctive set-labelings with respect to the suitable choice of ground set $X$. The following theorem provides an answer this question.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{Thm-2.2a}\nEvery graph $G$ admits a disjunctive set-indexer.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $V=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\ldots,v_n\\}$ be the vertex set of $G$. Consider a non-empty set $X=\\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots,a_n\\}$. Now, define a function $f:V(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$ such that $f(v_i)=\\{a_i\\}$, where $1\\le i\\le n$. Clearly, $f$ is injective. Then, the induced edge function $f^{\\cup}:E(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)-\\{\\emptyset\\}$ is given by $f^{\\cup}(v_iv_j)=\\{a_i,a_j\\}$. For any two edges $e_r=v_iv_j$ and $e_s=v_kv_l$ in $E(G)$, we have  $f^{\\cup}(e_r)=\\{a_i,a_j\\}\\ne f^{\\cup}(e_s)=\\{a_k,a_l\\}$. Therefore, $f^{\\cup}$ is also injective. Hence, $f$ is a disjunctive set-indexer of $G$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n{\\noindent} Figure \\ref{fig:DSLG} illustrates a graph which admits a disjunctive set-labeling.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\linewidth]{DSLG}\n\\caption{An illustration to a DSL-Graph.}\n\\label{fig:DSLG}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAnalogous to the definition of disjunctive set-labeling of graph, the notion of a conjunctive set-labeling of a graph can be introduce as follows.\n\n\\begin{defn}\\label{Defn-2.3}{\\rm \nA {\\em conjunctive set-labeling} (CSL) of a graph $G$ with respect to a non-empty ground set $X$ is an injective set-valued function $f:V(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$, whose induced function $f^{\\cap}(uv):E(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)$ is defined by $f^{\\cap}(uv)=f(u)\\cap f(v)$.

Then, the induced edge function $f^{\\cap}:E(G)\\to {\\mathscr{P}}(X)-\\{\\emptyset\\}$ is given by $f^{\\cap}(v_iv_j)=X-\\{a_i,a_j\\}$.
