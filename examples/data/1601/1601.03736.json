Current global oscillation data shows a mild\npreference for a large, potentially maximal value for the Dirac CP\nphase in the neutrino mixing matrix. In this letter, we point out that\nNew Physics in the form of neutral-current like non-standard\ninteractions with real couplings would likely yield a similar\nconclusion even if CP in the neutrino sector were\nconserved. Therefore, the claim for a discovery of leptonic CP\nviolation will require a robust ability to test New Physics scenarios.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nIn 2015 a Nobel prize for the discovery of neutrino oscillation was\ngiven. The bulk of the existing data currently is very well described\nby the oscillation of three active neutrinos, see for instance\nRef.~\\cite{Forero:2014bxa,Gonzalez-Garcia:2015qrr}. There are\npotential indications for additional, sterile neutrinos, which at this\nstage are not conclusive yet~\\cite{Abazajian:2012ys} and we therefore\nwill neglect for the remainder of this letter. Lately, due to a\ntension between reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments, a\npreference for a value of the Dirac CP phase close to $-\\pi/2$ was\nfirst reported in Ref.~\\cite{Abe:2013hdq}. The question of CP\nviolation in the leptonic sector is a priority of the future neutrino\nprogram and the main effort is dedicated to the DUNE\nexperiment~\\cite{Adams:2013qkq}. Apart from a number of experimental\nchallenges and the need to understand neutrino-nucleus interactions,\nsub-leading effects of theoretical origin can also affect the\ndetermination of the Dirac CP phase. In this letter we focus on\nso-called non-standard interactions (NSI), which have been speculated\nabout even before the discovery of neutrino\noscillation~\\cite{Wolfenstein:1977ue} and for a recent review see\nRef.~\\cite{Ohlsson:2012kf}. NSI provide a model independent, effective\nfield theory framework to include new physics effects in the standard\nneutrino description, see {\\it e.g.}  Ref.~\\cite{Miranda:2015dra}.\n\nNSI are parameterized by dimensionless couplings, ${\\varepsilon}$, which are\nmeasured relative to $G_F$. From neutrino data alone large magnitudes\nfor the dimensionless couplings $|{\\varepsilon}_{e \\tau}^{f=u,d}|\\lesssim 0.14$\nat $90\\%$ \\cite{Gonzalez-Garcia:2013usa} are allowed, which for Earth\nmatter densities translates into $|{\\varepsilon}_{e\n  \\tau}|\\sim\\mathcal{O}(1)$. Generally, NSI can provide new phases\nthat can potentially be new sources of CP violation. In the context of\nflavor changing NSI in the source and the detection of neutrinos a\ndiscussion of new sources of CP violation appeared in\nRef.~\\cite{GonzalezGarcia:2001mp}.  In the case of neutral current NSI\na discussion of this issue appeared in Ref.~\\cite{Winter:2008eg}. In\nthe context of NOvA, and motivated by large NSI allowed by solar\nneutrino data, one example of the potential NSI and standard\noscillation confusion was analyzed at the probability level in\nRef.~\\cite{Friedland:2012tq}.\n\nDirect bounds derived from the neutrino sector are typically of the\norder 0.1-1 in units of $G_F$, that is, New Physics contributions of\nabout the same size as the leading Standard Model (SM) contribution are\nstill allowed. On the other hand, any model where these new\ninteraction are introduced above the electroweak symmetry breaking\nscale has to address the fact that invariance under the weak $SU(2)$\ngroup will create a charged lepton counter part of any neutrino-only\noperator. Given that the electroweak scale is not very far from the\nscale at which typical neutrino experiments are conducted, breaking of\nthe electroweak symmetry does not erase the correspondence between\nneutral and charged lepton operators, at best factors of a few are\ngained. The charged lepton bounds involving the first and second\nfamily are very stringent. In Ref.~\\cite{Gavela:2008ra} a systematic\nanalysis of dimension 6 and 8 operators is performed and it is found\nthat for dimension 8 operators it is possible to arrange for\ncancellations, provided a suitable particle content is chosen, such\nthat large NSI in the neutrino sector can be realized without creating\nsizable effects in the charged lepton sector. This requires fine\ntuning and no actual models have been put forward. It is worth noting\nthat even without fine tuning, third family NSI in the $\\tau$ sector can\nbe potentially large of order 0.1\\,$G_F$, see {\\it\n  e.g.}~\\cite{Wise:2014oea}, since the corresponding charged lepton\nbounds themselves are very weak.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{t2kRegionPlot_all2.pdf} \n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{novaRegionPlot_all2.pdf} \n\n \\caption{Bi-rate plots.

An early example of a low-scale neutrino\nmass model (without NSI) is given in Ref.~\\cite{Davoudiasl:2005ks},\nwhere the breaking of a discrete gauge symmetry at a scale as low as a\nfew keV is responsible for small Dirac neutrino masses. It would be\nstraightforward to augment this model by additional flavor changing\nneutral currents to create large NSI. The general idea is to invoke\nnew light degrees of freedom which preferentially couple to neutrinos\nand/or dark matter particles, {\\it\n  e.g.}~\\cite{Harnik:2012ni,Farzan:2015doa}. These models tend to\nintroduce new self-interactions in the dark matter sector and need to\nobserve the relevant astrophysical bounds from structure\nformation. Also, in some of these models there are connections to the\nsterile neutrino sector, which in turn can help to accommodate sterile\nneutrinos in cosmology~\\cite{Hannestad:2013ana}. Thus, we see that\nthere is ample room from both an experimental and theoretical\nperspective for relatively large NSI. The resulting degeneracies\nbetween New Physics and oscillation physics recently have been studied\nin Ref.~\\cite{Liao:2016hsa} in a more general setting. Here, we will\nstudy specifically the impact neutral current-like NSI can have on the\nanalysis of Daya Bay, T2K and NOvA data sets and point out that the\ncurrent hint for maximal CP violation maybe in fact be caused by CP\n\\emph{conserving} New Physics.\n\n\nThe standard neutrino oscillations in vacuum are described by the\nHamiltonian:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:H0}\nH_{0}=\\frac{1}{2E} \\left[ U \\, \\text{diag}\\left(0,\\Delta m_{21}^2,\\Delta m_{31}^2 \\right) \n\\, U^\\dagger \\right]\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H_{0}=\\frac{1}{2E}\\left[U\\,\\text{diag}\\left(0,\\Delta m_{21}^{2},\\Delta m_{31}^%&#10;{2}\\right)\\,U^{\\dagger}\\right]\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>U</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>diag</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mn>21</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mn>31</mn><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>U</mi><mo>\u2020</mo></msup></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03736.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nwith $V=\\sqrt{2}\\,G_F\\,N_e$, where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant and\n$N_e$ is the electron density on Earth.

However, only few of them are present in an\nspecific oscillation channel. In the particular case of the\n(anti)neutrino appearance channel, only the two NSI complex parameters\n${\\varepsilon}_{e\\mu}$ and ${\\varepsilon}_{e\\tau}$ play a role\n\\cite{Kopp:2007ne}.

In addition, we have\nalso implemented a simulation of NOvA running 3 years in neutrino mode\nplus 3 years in antineutrino mode \\cite{Patterson:2012zs}. The set of \noscillation parameters\nused along this work corresponds to the best fit values in\nRef.~\\cite{Forero:2014bxa} except for the reactor mixing angle that\nwas fixed to the Daya Bay best fit value in Ref.~\\cite{An:2015rpe}.\n\nThe interplay of the Dirac CP phase and the NSI parameters in each of\nthe two considered facilities is shown in the bi-rate plots of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:bi-rate}.  For the chosen values of the NSI parameters,\nand considering the errors in both NSI and SM rates, an overlap in the\nSM point $\\delta_{CP}=-\\pi/2$ is clearly shown in both panels for T2K\nand NOvA. However, notice that in the case of the T2K rates (left \npanel) there is a tension between the considered NSI cases and the the\nSM point $\\delta_{CP}=-\\pi/2$. Thus, in combination with NOvA the\n`confusion' will be significant for the NSI case with\n$\\delta_{CP}=\\pi$.\n\nBy assuming CP conserving values, in the presence of NSI, the freedom\nin $|{\\varepsilon}|$ and $\\phi$ can be used to `mimic' the SM point\n$\\delta_{CP}=-\\pi/2$. Basically, the value of $|{\\varepsilon}|$ sets the\nopening of the NSI ellipse while the phase $\\phi$ can be tuned to\ncoincide with the SM and NSI intersection point. Notice that, for T2K\n(left panel), a larger value for $|{\\varepsilon}|$ is needed to exactly pick\nthe SM point $\\delta_{CP}=-\\pi/2$ while for NOvA (right panel) a\nsmaller ${\\varepsilon}$ would instead be required. This is mainly due to the\ndifferent baseline of both experiments since the sensitivity to the\nNSI depends on the SM and NSI interference of vacuum and matter\noscillations (see Eq.~(33) of Ref.~\\cite{Kopp:2007ne}). Thus, a\ncombination of experiments with different baselines limits the\nparameter tuning we are discussing, which in the future may allow to\ndisentangle these effects if both high-statistic data sets from DUNE\nand T2HK are\navailable~\\cite{Masud:2015xva,deGouvea:2015ndi,Coloma:2015kiu}. However,\nour philosophy here is quite different: Given a particular set of NSI\nparameters (allowed by current bounds) we want to quantified the level\nof `confusion' if the currently preferred value for the $\\delta_{CP}$\nturned out to be correct.\n\nTo quantify the sensitivity to the SM Dirac CP phase in the presence\nof NSI we have adopted the usual $\\chi^2$ analysis where\n$n_i=n_i(\\vec\\lambda^{\\text{true}},{\\varepsilon}^{\\text{true}})$ and\n$\\mu_i=\\mu_i(\\vec\\lambda)$ corresponds to the simulated and test\nevents, respectively. The set of standard oscillation parameters,\nmixing angles, Dirac CP phase and the solar and atmospheric\nsplittings, are represented by $\\vec\\lambda$. To test SM oscillations\nrates $\\mu_i$ against the ones with NSI, we implemented random\nstatistical fluctuations (Poisson distributed) on the `true' rates\n$n_i$.  Gaussian priors for all the standard oscillation parameters\nbut $\\delta_{CP}$ were included in the analysis.\n\nOur main result is presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:histogramCP180}. The\ndistribution of the Dirac CP phase best fit values for SM and NSI\ninteractions are shown in the left panel.  In all cases\n$\\delta_{CP}^{\\text{true}}=\\pi$. In the case of the SM, the\n$\\delta_{CP}$ has values distributed around CP conserving values\nincluding zero but it is mainly distributed around $\\delta_{CP}=\\pm\n\\pi$ as expected. When NSI are considered, two general features\nappear: In the case of complex NSI, $\\phi=-\\pi/2$ and $\\phi=\\pi/2$,\n$\\delta_{CP}$ is distributed with a higher probabilities respect to\nthe SM case around values that are close to zero and $\\pi$,\nrespectively; and the distributions are very peaked around their mean\nvalue. However, when $\\phi=0$ (real NSI) the distribution of\n$\\delta_{CP}$ is broader and extends for half of the parameter space\nin the positive region. In this case, the mean value is located near\n$\\delta_{CP}=\\pi$ with a probability closer to the one of the SM\ncase. In the remaining case of real NSI $\\phi=\\pi$ also the\ndistribution is broader but the main feature is that its mean value is\ncentered at $\\delta_{CP}=-\\pi/2$ almost with the same probability of\nthe SM case. In both cases with real NSI there is a non-negligible\nprobability to find $\\delta_{CP}$ violating values even though\n$\\delta_{CP}^{\\text{True}}$ has assumed to be CP conserving. This\nresult is remarkable, in particular when $\\phi=\\pi$, in the\nlight of the current preference for the Dirac CP phase value.\n\nThe corresponding distribution of the $\\chi^2$-minima, for each case\nof the right hand panel, are shown in the left hand panel of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:histogramCP180}. Due to the random statistical\nfluctuations the $\\chi^2_{\\text{min}}$ for the SM case is centered at\n$\\chi^2\\simeq 40$ corresponding the number of bins minus the number of\nfitted parameters. However, the main feature is that all the NSI\n$\\chi^2$ distributions are centered within $\\sim 7$ units from the SM\ncentral value with almost the same probability. In the main case of\n$\\phi=\\pi$ both SM and NSI the $\\chi^2$ distributions are even closer,\nthey almost completely overlap each other. This result shows that\nexisting experiment can \\emph{not} distinguish these two cases.\n\n\nTo summarize, we have studied the robustness of the recent hint for\nmaximal leptonic CP violation in the presence of neutral current-like\nNSI. We simulate many iterations of the same experiments, T2K and\nNOvA, and perform a fit to the resulting data, both for a purely three\nflavor oscillation and  in presence of NSI. We find, that even if\nCP is fully conserved by the NSI and standard oscillations, a\npreference for the best fit value of the leptonic CP phase\n$\\delta\\simeq -\\pi/2$. Thus, the current hint for maximal leptonic CP\nviolation can be either due to maximal leptonic CP violation or CP\nconservation in the presence of New Physics. The $\\chi^2$\ndistributions in both cases are nearly identical, high-lighting the\nneed for new experiments like DUNE and T2HK to resolve this confusion.\n\n\n\\acknowledgements We would like to thank P.~Coloma for her help with\nthe GLoBES files and J.~Kopp for a clarification in the use of his NSI\ntool.
