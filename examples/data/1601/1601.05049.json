Their vibrational energies are in the GHz\nand MHz regimes, respectively~\\cite{greene00,hamilton02}. Apart from the Rb ULRMs within the above-mentioned\nexperiments, Cesium blue detuned ULRMs~\\cite{Tallant12} and Strontium ULRMs~\\cite{Killian15} from divalent atomic\nsystems have been prepared and explored. The detection of the singlet/triplet hyperfine structure and scattering\nchannels has been very recently performed in~\\cite{Sassmannshausen15}. Due to the sensitivity of these {Rydberg } molecules to \nexternal fields, their electronic structure, molecular geometry and rovibrational dynamics could be\ncontrolled and manipulated easily by using weak static magnetic and electric fields or laser \nfields~\\cite{lesanovsky07,kurz12,kurz13,kurz14}. Very recently a selective excitation of rovibrational \nmolecular states with a \nvariable degree of alignment and antialignment has been demonstrated experimentally by using a magnetic \nfield~\\cite{krupp14}.\n\nAdding more ground-state atoms to the {Rydberg } cloud, polyatomic ultralong-range molecules could be formed.\nHowever, very little is known about the structure and properties of these species.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{rost06} the emphasis was put on the splitting of the energy levels and the construction of symmetry-adapted orbitals.\nWhile a repulsive interaction does not support bound states, it is shown in Ref.~\\cite{rost09}\nthat adding a second ground-state atom, a long-range bound triatomic molecule becomes possible.\nRecently Rydberg trimers and excited dimers bound by quantum reflection have been studied experimentally\nand theoretically~\\cite{bendkowsky10}. We note that experimentally the transition from a {Rydberg } dimer to a \n{Rydberg } polyatomic has been achieved by increasing the principal quantum number of the {Rydberg } state~\\cite{gaj14}. \n\nIn the present work, we explore, to our knowledge for the first time, the impact of an external electric\nfield on the electronic structure of a triatomic ultralong-range molecule formed by a Rydberg atom and two neutral ground-state atoms.\nThe two ground-state atoms and the {Rydberg } core are described as point particles, \nand we restrict this study to the low-energy regime approximating the interaction between the Rydberg \nelectron and each neutral atom by the  Fermi pseudopotential~\\cite{fermi34,Omont}.\nCompared to previous studies about the electronic structure of these triatomic {Rydberg } molecules~\\cite{rost06,rost09}, \nwe include both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interactions of the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atoms. \nOur focus is on three different configurations: two collinear and one planar arrangement of the atoms.\nFor the collinear configurations, we consider the symmetric case where the two ground-state atoms are\nlocated on different sides of the positively charged {Rydberg } core and at the same distance from it,\nsee~\\autoref{fig:configurations}~(a), and an asymmetric case with the atoms being\nlocated on the same side of the Rb$^+$ core and at different distances,  see~\\autoref{fig:configurations}~(b). \nWe also analyze a planar configuration where the two straight lines \nconnecting the spatial positions of each ground-state atom and the {Rydberg } core form an angle smaller than $\\pi$,\nthereby assuming that the distances of the two ground-state atoms from the {Rydberg } core are the same, \nsee~\\autoref{fig:configurations}~(c).\n \\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{fig1.eps}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Sketches (not to scale) of three different configurations of the triatomic molecule formed by a\n Rydberg atom and two ground-state atoms in the $XZ$-plane.} \n\\label{fig:configurations}\n\\end{figure} \n\nWe investigate the molecular states of collinear and planar geometries by analyzing their\nadiabatic potential  curves (APC) and surfaces (APS) within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, respectively. \nFor the above-mentioned three configurations, we encounter a variety of different molecular states with deep potential\nwells leading to bound ULRMs. We explore in particular the impact of an additional electric field on these adiabatic potentials\nand show that the bound character of the molecular states increases in case of the linear configuration. \n\n\nThe paper is organized as follows.

For the sake of comparison, the APCs of a diatomic ULRM with the ground state atom located on the LFF $Z$-axis are also presented.\n\n\nLet us first analyze the $\\Sigma$ molecular levels. \nFor the triatomic ULRM, the $p$-wave interaction provokes that \ntwo additional  potentials with $\\Sigma$  molecular symmetry are shifted away from  the  Rb($n = 35$, $l\\ge 3$) \ndegenerate manifold. \nThe resonance of the  $p$-wave scattering  length at $R\\approx780~a_0$ significantly affects  the APC \nand their slope becomes pronounced for $R\\lesssim 1200~a_0$. \nIndeed,  two of these APCs suffer avoided crossings with \n the adiabatic state evolving from the non-degenerate {Rydberg } level  Rb($38s$), whose energy,\n on the scale of the figure, remains \n approximately constant  for larger values of $R$.  \nThe  $p$-wave and $s$-wave dominated $\\Sigma$-APCs suffer several avoided crossings close to \nthe internuclear distance $R\\approx 1500~a_0$.\nThe oscillatory behavior of these adiabatic potentials is due to the highly oscillatory character of the {Rydberg } \nelectron \nwave function in the Rb($n=35$, $l\\geqslant 3$) state. \nThe ground-state atoms, considered to a good approximation as \npoint particles,  probe   locally in space the  electronic wave function of the highly excited {Rydberg } atom. \nAt large separations between the {Rydberg } core and the ground-state atoms, the  $s$-wave \n($p$-wave) \ndominated $\\Sigma$ molecular states become degenerate and converge to the $s$-wave ($p$-wave)   \n$\\Sigma$-APC of the  diatomic  ULRM.\nFor these large values of $R$, the electronic structure  of the triatomic ULRM  is composed of \nthe molecular states of two diatomic ULRMs that share the same {Rydberg } core and  one has the ground-state \natom at $\\theta=0$ whereas  the other one has it at $\\theta=\\pi$. \n\nWe focus now on the  APCs with $\\Pi$ molecular symmetry.\nThe  $p$-wave interaction is responsible for the adiabatic potentials with $\\Pi$ molecular \nsymmetry, cf.~\\autoref{fig:FF_linear_1_35_l}~(c). In contrast to \nthe  $\\Pi$ molecular levels of  the diatomic ULRM, these two APCs show potential wells that \ncould accommodate  several vibrational bound states. \nFor large internuclear distances, these two adiabatic electronic\n potentials become degenerate and equal to the corresponding potentials of a diatomic ULRM. \n\n\n \\begin{figure}[t]\n \\includegraphics[scale=0.8,angle=0]{fig4.eps}\n\\centering\n \\caption{For the symmetric linear ULRM:  \nmolecular states  with $\\Sigma$ symmetry evolving from the degenerate manifold Rb($n=35$, $l\\ge 3$)  versus the interatomic distance $R$  of the ground-state atoms from \n the Rydberg core  in an external electric field of strength \n (a)  $F=100$~V/m,  (b) $F=300$~V/m,  and (c) $F=500$~V/m.\nThe APCs have been derived including both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interaction.  \n  The zero energy has been set to the energy of the field-free  Rb($n =35$, $l\\ge3$) degenerate manifold.}\n\\label{fig:linear_trimer_field}\n \\end{figure}\nDue to their large dipole moments, {Rydberg } atoms are extremely sensitive to weak static electric fields, and, as \nconsequence, the level structure of the \nULRM is also significantly affected. In~\\autoref{fig:linear_trimer_field}~(a), (b) and (c), we present \nthe APCs with $\\Sigma$ molecular symmetry in a static electric field\nof strength $F=100$~V/m, $300$~V/m, and $500$~V/m, respectively. \nDue to the interaction with the dc field,\nadditional molecular states are shifted from  the field-free Rb($n = 35$, $l\\ge 3$) {Rydberg } manifold,\nwhich reflects that the Stark interaction couples states with field-free \norbital numbers $l$ and $l\\pm1$. \nThe \telectric field couples the adiabatic electronic states with gerade and ungerade symmetry\nand the degeneracy at large internuclear distances of these APCs is lifted. \nFor  $F=100$~V/m, the overall energy of one of the  states\n with $s$-wave ($p$-wave) dominated character decreases, whereas the energy of the second\none  increases approaching the adiabatic electronic states from the Rb($n = 35$, $l\\ge 3$) manifold.\nBy further increasing  $F$, the energies of all APCs show a decreasing behaviour.\nFor  $F=500$~V/m, two of the APCs  are merged with the field-dressed adiabatic electronic\npotentials that are split from the field-free Rb($n = 35$, $l\\ge 3$) {Rydberg } manifold, and we encounter several avoided \ncrossings, see~\\autoref{fig:linear_trimer_field}~(c). \nThus, only two molecular states remain energetically well separated from the field-dressed levels\nevolving from the  Rb($n = 35$, $l\\ge 3$) {Rydberg } manifold. \nThe avoided crossing  between the lowest-lying  APCs from the {Rydberg } trimer\nRb($5s$)Rb($n = 35$, $l\\ge 3$)Rb($5s$) and the molecular state from Rb($5s$)Rb($38s$)Rb($5s$) becomes \nbroader as $F$ is increased. \nNote that  due to the quadratic Stark shift of the $38s$ {Rydberg } state, the APC of Rb($5s$)Rb($38s$)Rb($5s$)\nis very weakly affected by the electric field. \nDue to the interplay between the interaction of the {Rydberg } atom with the two neutral atoms and with the \nexternal electric field, the change in energy of the APCs depends on the internuclear separation \nbetween  the {Rydberg } core and  the two ground-state atoms. \nAt large internuclear distances, when the interaction with the two ground-state atoms becomes \nnegligible,  all the APCs from the Rb$(n=35,l\\ge3$) {Rydberg } manifold are shifted linearly in energy  with the \ndc field strength, which corresponds with the Stark shift of the $(n=35,l\\ge3$)  {Rydberg } manifold of an isolated Rb atom. \n\n\n\nAnalogous results are found for  the field-dressed molecular states with $\\Pi$ molecular symmetry, \nsee~\\autoref{fig:linear_pi_trimer_field}.  For large internuclear separations $R\\gtrsim1400~a_0$, \nthe degeneracy  of the two $\\Pi$ \nadiabatic  electronic states is lifted.\nFor $F=100$~V/m, one of the APCs increases in  energy  compared to its field-free value,\nwhereas the other one decreases,~see~\\autoref{fig:linear_pi_trimer_field}~(a), whereas\nfor $F=300$~V/m and $F=500$~V/m the energies of all APCs are reduced.  \nIn addition, the crossing of the field-free APCs at  $R\\approx 1060~\u00c2\u00a0a_0$ becomes an avoided crossing \nin the presence of the dc field. \nThese $\\Pi$ molecular states are weakly  affected by the external field for \n$1000~a_0\\lesssim R\\lesssim 1250~a_0$, \ntheir Stark shifts depend quadratically on the  field strength and  are hardly visible on the \nscale of~\\autoref{fig:linear_pi_trimer_field}. \nFor instance, the energy of the minimum appearing at $R\\approx 1115~a_0$ for\nthe lowest lying $\\Pi$-APC  \nis shifted  $0.3$~GHz from  its field-free value for  $F=500$~V/m.\nAs $F$ is increased, the field-free highest-lying APC gets mixed with the additional field-dressed APCs \nevolving from the  Rb$(n=35,l\\ge3)$ manifold suffering several avoided crossings with them. \nAgain, at large internuclear distances, the Stark  shifts of \nall the APCs from the Rb$(n=35,l\\ge3$) {Rydberg } manifold depend linearly  on $F$.\n \n  \\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8,angle=0]{fig5.eps}\n \\caption{For the symmetric linear ULRM: electronic states with $\\Pi$ molecular symmetry evolving from the degenerate manifold Rb($n=35, l \\ge 3$)  versus the interatomic distance $R$ \n of the ground-state atoms from the {Rydberg } core  in an electric field of strength \n (a)  $F=100$~V/m,  (b) $F=300$~V/m,  and (c) $F=500$~V/m.\n The APCs have been derived including both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interaction.  \n  The zero energy has been set to the  field-free   energy of the Rb($n =35$, $l\\ge3$) degenerate manifold.}\n\\label{fig:linear_pi_trimer_field}\n \\end{figure}\n \n \n \\subsection{The non-symmetric linear configuration}\n\nWe consider now a linear triatomic  {Rydberg } molecule with the two ground-state atoms located along the LFF \n$Z$-axis and  at the same side of the {Rydberg } core,  {i.\\,e.}, $\\theta_{1}=\\theta_{2}=\\pi$. \nA sketch of this configuration is presented in~\\autoref{fig:configurations}~(b).\nThe position of one of the atoms  is fixed at the $R_1=1200~a_0$, \nwhereas the distance of the second one from the Rb$^+$ core, $R_2$, varies for \n$R_2>R_1$.  This condition allows us to neglect the interaction between both ground-state atoms\n because their vibrational wave functions don't overlap in space.\nNote that the distance of the first atom from the Rb$^+$ core has been arbitrarily fixed to $R_1=1200~a_0$,  \nand that qualitatively similar results are obtained for other values of $R_1$. \nThe  $\\Sigma$ and $\\Pi$ molecular states \nare plotted versus the internuclear separation  $R_2$ in~\\autoref{fig:FF_linear_same_side}\nand~\\autoref{fig:FF_linear_same_side_pi}, respectively.\nFor the electronic structure with $\\Sigma$  molecular symmetry, \nthe presence of the second atom provokes that two extra adiabatic electronic states  are split away from the  \nRb($n=35$ and $l\\ge 3$)  degenerate manifold. \nThese two APCs show an oscillatory behaviour superimposed to a broad potential well over\nthe regions $1400~a_0\\lesssim R_2\\lesssim  2350~a_0$ and \n$1300~a_0\\lesssim  R_2\\lesssim 2700~a_0$ for the $p$-wave \nand $s$-wave dominated states, respectively. \nThese APCs can accommodate many vibrational levels, \nwith spacing $\\sim 150$MHz approximately, some of the them having   \nspatial  extensions of a few hundreds Bohr radii.  \nSeveral avoided crossings are encountered between these two adiabatic electronic states, and also between \nthe $s$-wave dominated state and the $p$-wave dominated state evolving from the {Rydberg } diatomic molecule.\nFor large values of   $R_2$, the interaction with the second atom becomes negligible and \nthe triatomic {Rydberg } molecule becomes an effective  diatomic system. \nIn this case, the two energetically lowest $\\Sigma$-symmetry  APCs have  the energies of the \ncorresponding  electronic states of the  diatomic {Rydberg } molecule\nwith the ground-state atom located at $R_1=1200~a_0$; \nwhereas the other two APCs approach zero energy.\nDue to the second atom,  an extra  $\\Pi$ molecular state is shifted from the \nRb($n=35$ and $l\\ge 3$)\n{Rydberg } manifold, see~\\autoref{fig:FF_linear_same_side_pi}~(a), which shows a deep well with a minimum at $R\\approx 1345~a_0$.\nThis APC  is deep enough to  accommodate several vibrational bound states, where the triatomic molecule \nwould exist. \nThe lowest-lying molecular state of this symmetry has a shallow potential well  of approximately $150$~MHz deep at $R_2\\approx1410~a_0$.\nFor $R\\gtrsim1500~a_0$, the lowest lying $\\Pi$-APC shows a constant behaviour\nwith the energy of the corresponding APC of the diatomic ULRM.\n\n \\begin{figure}[t]\n \\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8,angle=0]{fig6.eps}\n \\caption{Asymmetric linear  ULRM with the two ground-state atoms located at the same\n side of the {Rydberg } core, {i.\\,e.}, $\\theta_{1}=\\theta_{2}=\\pi$\n and one fixed at $R_1^*=1200~a_0$. \n APCs with $\\Sigma$ molecular symmetry evolving from the degenerate manifold \n Rb($n=35$, $l\\ge 3$)  \n versus the separation $R_2$ between the second atom and Rb$^+$, \n for an electric field of strength \n (a) $F=0$~V/m, (b) $F=300$~V/m,  and (c) $F=500$~V/m.\n The APCs have been derived including both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interaction.  \nThe zero energy has been set to the  field-free    energy of the Rb($n =35$, $l\\ge3$) degenerate manifold.}\n\\label{fig:FF_linear_same_side}\n \\end{figure} \n\n\n\n\nIn the presence of an external  electric field, the energy of the APCs with $\\Sigma$ and $\\Pi$ molecular \nsymmetries  decreases as $F$ is increased, see~\\autoref{fig:FF_linear_same_side}\nand ~\\autoref{fig:FF_linear_same_side_pi}. \nWe start analyzing the results for the electronic states with $\\Sigma$ molecular symmetry.\nThe APC of the  Rb($38s$)Rb($5s$)Rb($5s$) trimer  is weakly affected by the electric field due to the quadratic \nStark effect of the  Rb($38s$) {Rydberg } state.\nThe lowest-lying APC evolving  from the Rb($n=35, l\\ge 3$) manifold has an energy\nsmaller than the Rb$(38s)$Rb($5s$)Rb($5s$) electronic state for $F=300$~V/cm and $500$~V/cm. \nThe second-lowest-lying APC evolving  from the Rb($n=35, l\\ge 3$) manifold also decreases in energy and\nits outermost well becomes more pronounced and shows an increasing depth as $F$ is increased.\nFor the two extra adiabatic electronic states with  $\\Sigma$ symmetry, which appear  due to the second \natom, the electric field provokes that their broad wells become less deep whereas the \nsuperimposed oscillatory behaviour remains,  see Figures~\\ref{fig:FF_linear_same_side}~(b) and (c). \nThe Stark effect breaks the  degeneracy of the field-free degenerate adiabatic electronic states \nand extra APCs are shifted from the field-free degenerate manifold Rb($n=35, l\\ge3$). \nThese extra molecular levels show an oscillatory behavior for $R_2\\lesssim 2000~a_0$, which provokes many \navoided crossings among  them,  and  for larger values of  $R_2$, they possess a constant energy\napproximately.\n\nSimilar results are observed for the adiabatic energies with $\\Pi$ molecular symmetry, \nsee~\\autoref{fig:FF_linear_same_side_pi}. \nThe lowest-lying molecular state \nevolving  from the Rb($n=35, l\\ge 3$) {Rydberg } manifold suffers a quadratic Stark effect\nand, therefore, is weakly  affected by the weak electric field. The second lowest-lying potential decreases in \nenergy as $F$  increases and the depth of the pronounced wells is significantly reduced,\nbut remains  a few GHz deep and can accommodate vibrational bound states. An increasing number of\navoided crossings for large values of $R_2$ with increasing field strength is encountered. \n \\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.8,angle=0]{fig7.eps}\n \\caption{Asymmetric linear  ULRM,\n with the two ground-state atoms located at the same\n side of the {Rydberg } core, {i.\\,e.}, $\\theta_{1}=\\theta_{2}=\\pi$\n and one fixed at $R_1^*=1200~a_0$. \n  APCs  with $\\Pi$ molecular symmetry evolving \n from the degenerate manifold Rb($n=35$, $l\\ge 3$) as a function of \ndistance $R_2$ between the {Rydberg } core and the second atom \n for an electric field of strengths \n (a) $F=0$~V/m, (b) $F=300$~V/m,  and (c) $F=500$~V/m.\n The APCs have been derived including both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interaction.  \nThe zero energy has been set to the  field-free   energy of the Rb($n =35$, $l\\ge3$) degenerate manifold.}\n \\label{fig:FF_linear_same_side_pi}\n \\end{figure} \n\n\n\\section{The planar  triatomic {Rydberg } molecule}\n\\label{sec:planar_rb3}\n\n  \nIn this section, we  consider a planar ULRM with the neutral atoms located in\n the LFF $XZ$-plane, {i.\\,e.}, $\\phi_1=\\phi_2=0$,\nand $\\theta_2=\\pi-\\theta_1$ with \n$0\\le \\theta_1<\\pi/2$, see~\\autoref{fig:configurations}~(c).

This is due to the spatial proximity of the \ntwo ground-state atoms.\nBy adding an electric field, the APS strongly depends on the polar angle $\\theta_1$. \nThe electric field parallel to the $Z$ axis  favours the linear configuration of the ULRM  \nwith  both ground-state atoms located along the $Z$ axis, see Figures~\\ref{fig:FF_planar_side}~(b) and (c).\nFor this APS, the deepest well is shifted towards larger values of $R$ as $F$\nis increased, and it is located  at $R\\approx 2200~a_0$, $\\theta_1=0$ and \n$\\theta_2=\\pi$  for $F=500$~V/m. \nThis molecular curve approaches to a constant energy, given by the corresponding {Rydberg } state of the \nfield-dressed Rb for large internuclear separations and large values of $\\theta_1$.\nFor $F=500$~V/m,  this effect is observed for \n$\\theta_1\\gtrsim1.1$, and  its limit is the energy the lowest-lying  field-dressed  state \nof the {Rydberg } manifold $(n=35,l\\ge3$) of an isolated Rb atom in an electric field. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:con}\n\nWe have investigated ultralong-range triatomic {Rydberg } molecules formed by a {Rydberg } rubidium atom and two\nground-state Rb atoms in the  presence of an external electric field.  \nThis is, to our knowledge, the first investigation of such a triatomic ULRM in an electric field. \nThe symmetric and  asymmetric linear configurations, as well as \na planar one with the neutral atoms located at the same distance from the {Rydberg } core have been explored. \nWe have performed an analysis of the electronic structure for the Rb {Rydberg } atom in the \n degenerate manifold ($n=35, l\\ge 3)$.\n For the  linear configurations,  in the absence of the electric field several molecular  states, \n with $\\Sigma$ and $\\Pi$ symmetry, \n are split from the Rb($n=35, l\\ge 3)$ manifold,  showing an oscillatory behaviour with many wells  \n accommodating vibrational levels where the {Rydberg } molecule would exist.\n For the planar configuration, we encounter that the molecular states only show a significant dependence on\n $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ as the two ground-state atoms approach each other.\nThe electric field favours the symmetric linear  configuration\nand strengthen the bound state character of molecular states, and vibrational states\n with the spatial extensions of  a few hundreds Bohr radii could appear. \n\n\nAn inmediate extension of this work would be to investigate the electronic structure and \nvibrational properties of an ultralong-range  triatomic molecule formed from \na Rb {Rydberg } atom in a non-degenerate   state with orbital quantum number $l\\le 3$. \nFor diatomic  {Rydberg }  molecules, it has been shown that the \nRydberg-atom fine structure and the hyperfine coupling of the ground-state atom\nsignificantly alter the adiabatic electronic potentials evolving from the {Rydberg } atom in such excited \nstates~\\cite{Sassmannshausen15,Anderson14}.\nBy including these couplings for a triatomic {Rydberg } molecule, the potential energy surfaces depend on the \n hyperfine states of the ground-state atoms as well as on the fine structure of the {Rydberg } atom.\n As a consequence, the complexity of the molecular states would be significantly enhanced.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nR.G.F.  and J.A.F.  acknowledge financial support by the Spanish project FIS2014-54497-P (MINECO), \nand by the Andalusian research group FQM-207.\nWe also acknowledge financial support by the Initial Training Network COHERENCE of the European \nUnion FP7 framework.
