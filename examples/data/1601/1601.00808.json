Bitumen emulsions,\nwhich are formed by injecting a few percent of water into hot bitumen\nare used to pave roads at much\nmoderate temperatures, between $13$\\degree C and $23$\\degree C.~\\cite{muthen}\nThe emulsion has a much lower viscosity than the bitumen itself allowing for\nan easier mixing with the aggregates.~\\cite{muthen}\nAfter the mixing step, the water evaporates over several months\nleaving bitumen with $0$ to $4$\\%\nin mass of water in its driest state.~\\cite{muthen}\n\nOne of the reasons why the role of water in bitumen is so\ncomplex and rich is that bitumen is very hydrophobic,~\\cite{salou, kasongo}\nwhile some of the large\naromatic molecules in bitumen, known as asphaltene molecules, are slightly polar.\nThey are believed to stabilize the water-in-oil emulsion~\\cite{mullins2011}\nand even assemble more closely in the presence of water.~\\cite{gray}\nThis complex interplay between water and bitumen \nexplains why the mechanism by which water causes pavement deterioration is still debated.\nIn this context, the aim of this article is to address two main questions:\n(i) How is the structure and internal cohesion of bitumen changed in the\npresence of water? (ii) How and how fast do the water molecules travel inside the bitumen?\n\nTo answer these two questions, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations \nof a modified model bitumen, known as Cooee bitumen.~\\cite{hansen_jcp_2013}\nThis model bitumen contains four molecule types chosen to resemble the\nHubbard-Stanfield classification.~\\cite{hubbard:1948} The asphaltene and resin molecules\nof this model contain $2$ and $1$ sulfur atoms, respectively. \nThe sulfur atom is chosen because it is by far the most\ncommon heteroatom in most bitumens.~\\cite{shrp645}\nThe polarity\ndue to the presence of this heteroatom is taken into account in\nthe MD simulations by adding \na partial charge on the sulfur atom and on the neighboring carbon atoms.\nSeveral systems with a growing concentration of water molecules are considered.\nFor each of them, the cohesion and structure of bitumen are quantified using\nthe cohesive energy of each molecule type, the radial distribution function and\nthe average size of the nanoaggregates in bitumen.\nThe structure and dynamics of the water molecules are quantified\nusing the Delaunay tessellation, mean squared displacement\nand hydrogen bond dynamics. \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section~\\ref{sec:simuDetails}\ncontains the necessary information about the molecular model and\nthe simulations. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:results}, results on the bitumen\ncohesive energy and structure as well as on the structure and dynamics of water\nare discussed.\nSection~\\ref{sec:conclu} contains a summary and a conclusion.\n\n\\section{Molecular model and simulation details}\n\\label{sec:simuDetails}\nThe molecular model is the Cooee bitumen model~\\cite{hansen_jcp_2013}\nwhich consists of four constituent molecule types, representing the\nasphaltene, resin, resinous oil and hydrocarbon components in bitumen.\nThe structures of the four molecules chosen are presented in Fig. \\ref{fig:molstructure}. \n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\scalebox{0.23}{\\includegraphics[clip=true, trim={8cm 0 0 0}]{resin1_charges.png}}\n  \\scalebox{0.13}{\\includegraphics{docosane.jpg}} \\\\\n  \\scalebox{0.18}{\\includegraphics{asphaltene1.png}}\n  \\scalebox{0.18}{\\includegraphics{resinoil1.jpg}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:molstructure} (Color online).

The sulfur\natom is also a Lennard-Jones particle, but with a different mass. In\nthe presence of water, electrostatic interactions may be important, and\nin this work we include these into the Cooee model using a simple\npoint charge model. In this way, the two methylene groups forming\nbonds with a sulfur are labeled $C_2$ and are each given a partial\npositive charge of $z=0.0407 e$ \\cite{liu:2010} as this group is less\nelectronegative than sulfur. Likewise the sulfur is given a\npartial negative charge of $z=-0.0817 e$, ensuring charge\nneutrality. Carbon-based groups not forming bonds with sulfur are\nlabeled $C_1$ and have zero charge. \n\nThe force field is a simple extension of the original Cooee bitumen\nforce field:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n  U({\\mathbf}{r})&=   \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j>i} 4\\epsilon_{ij}\\left[\n          \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\\right)^{12} -\n          \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\\right)^{6}\n          \\right] + \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j>i}\n          \\frac{z_iz_j}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0r_{ij}} + \\\\\n            &\\mbox{}\n            \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\text{\\tiny{bonds}}}k_s(r_{ij}-l_{\\text{\\tiny{b}}})^2 + \n            \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\text{\\tiny{angles}}}k_{\\theta}(\\cos \\theta -

It enables us to see the effect of temperature\nwith more accuracy.\nFor these simulations the equilibration period is $40$ million time steps\nand the production period $20$ million time steps.\nThese extensive runs are performed on a GeForce GTX 780 Ti graphics card using\nthe RUMD software package~\\cite{rumd} version 3.0.\n\n\n\nThe sizes of water droplets were determined using a geometric\nanalysis.~\\cite{greenfield93} The simulation box was subdivided into\ntetrahedra using Delaunay tessellation. Atoms are located at each vertex, and\nthe Delaunay algorithm~\\cite{tanemura83} ensures that no atoms are located within a\ntetrahedron.  Droplets were defined by (1) identifying tetrahedra with at least\ntwo vertices being oxygen or hydrogen atoms of a water molecule, (2)\nnoting which of these tetrahedra shared common faces,\nand (3) iteratively grouping together such tetrahedra with the neighbors\n  of their neighboring tetrahedra until all regions that share connectivity\n  were connected.

It means that \nthe energetic contribution $N_{\\text{W}} ce_{\\text{W}}$ grows faster than linearly with an increasing water content.\nThis is not so surprising as the addition of one water molecule when only a few water molecules are present\ncauses the whole hydrogen bonded network to reorganise.\nThe other contributions to the cohesive energy stay constant. Consequently, the overall decrease of the cohesive energy\ndensity $ced$ is not due to a decrease of the cohesive energy inside bitumen, but rather\nto an increase in volume. In other words, when water molecules are added, the volume of the system increases,\nsome contributions to the cohesive energy increase,\nbut if bitumen molecules were added instead to match the same volume, the cohesive energy would increase more.\nIn total, the cohesive energy density decreases.\nWhen the temperature increases, the picture is slightly different.\n\n\n\n\nFigures~\\ref{fig:potEnergy} (c) and (d) show the variation of the two cohesive energies $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$\nand $ce_{\\text{D}}$, respectively, with the number of water molecules in the system, for\nthree different temperatures.\nThe cohesive energy $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$ associated to aromatic molecules stays constant with the water\ncontent at all temperatures. However, the cohesive energy $ce_{\\text{D}}$ associated to docosane molecules\ndecreases with the water content at high temperatures. Thus, at high temperatures, the overall\ndecrease of the cohesive energy density $ced$ is due both to an increase in volume and to a decrease\nof the cohesive energy in the docosane part of bitumen.\nThe distinction between docosane and aromatic molecules at high temperatures regarding their\nintrinsic cohesive energy when water is added can be surprising.\nIndeed, the aromatic molecules contain the slightly polar asphaltene\nand resin molecules, which are usually believed to interact more with water~\\cite{mullins2011, gray}\nthan with the apolar saturates.\nIf it was so, the water molecules should be located mainly close to the aromatic molecules,\nreplacing interactions among aromatic molecules by interactions between\nwater and aromatic molecules and thus decreasing the intrinsic cohesive energy of the aromatic molecules. \nThis is not observed. Instead, it is the intrinsic cohesive energy of the docosane molecules\nwhich is lowered, suggesting that water molecules are mainly close to docosane molecules and not to\naromatic molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{cohesiveEnergyAllVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{potEnergyEachContribVsNwT5.pdf}}\\\\\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{potEnergyVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{potEnergyDocoVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:potEnergy} (a): Variation of the cohesive energy density $ced$\nwith the number of water molecules $n_W$\nfor different temperatures.\n(b): Variation of each contribution to the cohesive energy density as described\nin Eq.~\\ref{eq:cedContrib} with the number of water molecules for $T = 377$ K.\nThe dashed horizontal lines correspond to the value at $n_W = 5$.\n(c) and (d): Variation of the cohesive energy between aromatic molecules $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$\nand docosane molecules $ce_{\\text{D}}$, respectively, with the number of water molecules $n_W$\nfor different temperatures.\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe idea that water molecules are closer to the saturates than to the\npolar aromatics can be directly checked\nusing radial distribution functions.

This figure shows that\nthe atoms closest to oxygen atoms, except hydrogen atoms from other water molecules,\nare from docosane molecules.\nThis result stays true for other temperatures and other water contents in\nCooee bitumen.\nWe believe that water molecules are closer to docosane molecules than to aromatic molecules\nbecause aromatic molecules are part of the nanoaggregates.\nNanoaggregates are composed of aligned flat aromatic molecules in the simulations. They are also a\nsupramolecular structure identified experimentally in bitumen.~\\cite{mullins2012}\nThe nanoaggregates are held together in the Cooee model by Lennard-Jones interactions\nbetween many aligned united atoms. This can be seen as a model of the $\\pi$-stacking\ninteraction existing between aromatic molecules in real bitumen.\nThe electrostatic interaction between\nthe positively charged hydrogen\nof a water molecule and the slightly negatively charged\nsulfur atom of an asphaltene or resin molecule is negligible\ncompared to the interaction holding the nanoaggregates together.\nThus, water molecules are unlikely to penetrate the nanoaggregates\nand have no other choice than to stay close to the docosane molecules.\nWe would like to stress here that this result could be altered if the\npolarity of the asphaltene and resin molecules is increased enough,\nor if they have the possibility to form hydrogen bonds. However, the\nmolecular structures used in this work for asphaltene and resin molecules\nare believed to be representative.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{rdfWater-Everything_nWater5_T5_SI.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:rdf} Radial distribution function between oxygen atoms in\n water molecules and other atoms\nin other types of molecules for $n_W = 5$ at temperature $T = 377$ K.\nError bars correspond to standard deviation on the data divided by the\nsquare root of the number of independent initial configurations considered.\n\n\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nThe variation of the intrinsic energy of the aromatic molecules $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$\nwith temperature and water content deserves some further discussion.\nAs already mentioned, the aromatic molecules in the Cooee bitumen are known to align in nanoaggregates.\nThe definition\nof the nanoaggregates in the case of Cooee bitumen is detailed in\nRefs.~\\cite{aging, branched} \nIt sums up to the following rule:\ntwo aromatic molecules\nare nearest neighbors in the same nanoaggregate if they are\nwell aligned and close enough.\nMore specifically, this rule is based on three thresholds.\nThe first threshold quantifies how much the molecules should be aligned\nto be declared in the same nanoaggregate.\nThis first threshold imposes boundaries to the angle $\\theta$ between the normal vectors to the aromatic planes\nof two different molecules. We choose $0\\degree \\leq  \\theta \\leq 34\\degree$\nand $149\\degree \\leq \\theta \\leq 180\\degree$.~\\cite{aging}\nThe second threshold is related to how close the molecules should be to be declared\nin the same nanoaggregate.\nThis second threshold imposes a maximum value to the distance $d_1$ between the aromatic planes\nof two different molecules. We impose $d_1 \\leq 6$ \\AA$ $.~\\cite{aging}\nTwo molecules far away but in the same plane can have a very low distance $d_1$. This is\nwhy a third threshold is needed.\nThe third threshold imposes a maximum value to the distance $d_2$ between the center of mass\nof the first molecule and the projection\nof the center of mass of the second molecule on the plane of the first molecule.\nWe fix $d_2 \\leq 0.7d_A$ \\AA$ $,~\\cite{aging} where $d_A=13.1$ \\AA\\  is the typical length\nof an asphaltene molecule\n\nin the Cooee model.\nSome nanoaggregates are branched, because the asphaltene molecule\nchosen in the Cooee model has a flat head and a flat body oriented in different directions, and\nboth parts can align with other aromatic molecules. \nThe average number of aromatic molecules inside a nanoaggregate is used to quantify\nthe size of the nanoaggregates.\nThe variation of the nanoaggregate size with the water content is displayed in Fig.~\\ref{fig:clusterSize}\nfor three different temperatures.\nThis figure shows that within error bars and for all temperatures, the nanoaggregate\nsize does not depend on the water content. This is in agreement\nwith the intrinsic cohesive energy of the aromatic molecules being independent of the water content.\nSurprisingly, the variation of the nanoaggregate size with temperature is non-monotonic.\nThis fact has been reported and explained.~\\cite{branched} It is due to two competing effects\nwhen temperature increases: the first effect is the increase of thermal noise which tends to detach\nmolecules from the nanoaggregates and decrease the nanoaggregate size; the second effect is the\nrelative increase of the number of asphaltene molecules inside the nanoaggregates compared to other molecule\ntypes, which tends to increase the degree of branching of the aggregates and also their size.\nThe non-monotonic behavior of the cohesive energy $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$ between aromatic\nmolecules is due to the same cause.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{clusterSizeVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:clusterSize} Variation of the average number of aromatic molecules $\\langle N_{\\text{mol}}\\rangle$\n with the number of water molecules $n_W$\nfor different temperatures.

The distribution of droplet volumes under all conditions are\nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}.  The y-axis indicates the probability\nthat a volume $V$ of water can be found within droplets of volume between $V$\nand $V + dV/V$;\nit is normalized so $\\int P(V) d\\ln V = 1$.  Results at 377~K\nshow that a range of droplet sizes can occur.  While most volume is usually\nfound in a single large droplet, significant numbers of cases were found with\nmultiple droplets with volumes between 90 and 200~\\AA$^3$ for the $n_w=300$\nsystem.  Similar results were found for $n_w = 200$ to 70 water molecules.\nOnly a single large droplet was typical for systems with fewer than 70 water\nmolecules.\n\n\\par \nResults at 452~K differ in that only a single droplet size was prevalent at\neach composition.  This potentially reflects better equilibration of the\nbitumen--water phase behavior due to faster water diffusion over nanosecond\ntime scales (see below).\n\n\\par \nResults at 603~K show a qualitative difference.  A broad distribution of drop\nsizes over a 1 to 70~\\AA$^3$ range is present at all water compositions.  For\n$n_w\\le 40$, most volume is found within states of $V < 1$~\\AA$^3$.  These\ncorrespond to individual water molecules.  \n\n\n\nCoalescence into larger droplets occurred for $n_w = 100$ and larger, though\nmore water molecules remained outside the largest droplet than in the 377 and\n452~K cases.\n\n\\par \n\nTwo measures of the droplet volume are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vavg}.\nSolid lines indicate the total volume of Delaunay tetrahedra that constitute\nlarge water droplets ($V\\ge 1$~\\AA$^3$).  Dashed lines indicate the volume of only the largest\ndroplet. Error bars indicate standard deviations on the size of the largest\ndroplet present, averaged over all configurations considered.\n\nThe total droplet volume increases approximately linearly with the number of\nwater molecules in the system.  Deviations from linearity are most notable at\nthe highest temperature for the smaller numbers of water molecules,\ni.e.\\ the cases that are dominated by an absence of coalesced droplets.\nLinearity indicates a homogeneous water environment as the number of water\nmolecules increases.\n\nThe average volumes of only the largest droplets indicate differences among\nthe three temperatures that are consistent with the volume distributions.\nMany drops are present in the 603~K\ncase, leading to the largest drop containing only a small to moderate fraction\nof the total drop volume until a large number of water molecules are present\n(mass fraction of ca.~1.6\\%).  Some cases of multiple droplets at\n377~K lead to similar but much smaller effects at that temperature at larger\nnumbers of water molecules. The larger error bars at high $n_W$ for both\n  temperatures are a consequence of the volume differences for the largest\n  droplet  when 2 or more droplets are present, such as 220~\\AA$^3$\n  vs.\\ 180~\\AA$^3$ in the case of 1 or 2 droplets at 377~K with $n_W=300$ \n  (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}).\nResults at 452~K show a more predominant\noccurrence of a single large droplet. Cases of multiple large droplets\nwere sufficiently rare at this temperature to lead to negligible\ndifferences between the average\nvolume of the largest droplet and of all large droplets.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\scalebox{0.5}{\n   \\includegraphics{size_distrib_LNnormalized-v3}\n   }\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:drop_Vdistrib} (Color online)\n      Volume-weighted distribution of droplet volumes at $T=377$, 452, and 603~K.\n      Separate distributions are computed for each number of water molecules.\n      Dotted lines indicate results at 377~K using only the final\n          1/3 of each trajectory.\n      }\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\scalebox{0.8}{\n  \\includegraphics{size_vs_Nwater-v5}\n  }\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:drop_Vavg} (Color online)\n      Average volume of the largest droplet (open symbols, dashed lines) and\n      of all large droplets (closed symbols, solid lines) at temperatures 377,\n      452, and 603~K and at 377~K using the final 1/3 of the trajectory.\n\n      }\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\par\nThe division of water molecules between large droplets and dispersed molecules\nwas also determined from the geometric analysis.\nThe number of water molecules that are not\nin droplets of $V > 1$~\\AA$^3$ are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_fracW} by\nsolid lines. It corresponds to the number of free water molecules.\nError bars indicate standard deviations across all configurations.\nEssentially all water molecules\nare in droplets at 377~K, and the number of free water molecules increases\nwith temperature. At 377 and 452~K, the number of free water\nmolecules decreases as the total number of water molecules increases \nbeyond $n_W=10$ in the\nsimulations. \nAt 603~K, most water molecules are free for concentrations up to\n$n_W=40$, then the number reaches a peak and decreases as the water\nconcentration increases further.  These results indicate that additional water\nmolecules add to the largest droplet.  This is consistent with a shift in the\ndroplet size distribution to larger volumes, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}.\n\nDashed lines indicate the number of water molecules that are not in the\nlargest droplet. Error bars indicate the standard deviation in the\n  number of water molecules that {\\em are} in the largest droplet; it applies\n  to counting those not in the largest droplet because the number of molecules\n  is constant in each simulation.\nResults at 603~K differ qualitatively by showing a large\nfraction of water molecules at all concentrations that are not in \nthe largest droplet.  This constitutes more than half of the water molecules \nfor systems with up to 100 water molecules. Results at 452~K show\n  essentially all water molecules belonging to a single large droplet.\n\n\\par\nDifferences between 377 and 452~K are suggested by the results\nat higher numbers of water molecules.  Multiple droplets exist at 377~K\n  for $n_W=100$ and larger when averaged over the entire simulation trajectory,\n  which is consistent with the multiple peaks shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}. \n  This leads to a significant number of water molecules outside of the\n  largest droplet.  However, further analysis shows that when multiple\n    droplets exist in cases of $n_W=40$ or more, they\n are present initially and coalesce into fewer droplets as\n  the simulation proceeds. This suggests that a longer\n  equilibration period would lead to one large droplet being predominant at\n  377~K, as is found at 452~K.\n\n\\par \nTo test this idea, the 377~K results were reanalyzed by using only the final\none third of the structures in each production run.  Results are shown by\ndotted lines.  The volume of the largest droplet (Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vavg})\nshifts toward the volume of all large droplets as a consequence of \ndroplets coalescing.  Similarly, the number of water molecules not in the\nlargest droplet decreases (Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_fracW}).  Changes in\nthe size distributions (Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}) are less apparent, in\npart because of the wide volume scale.  A clear change is the loss of droplet\nvolumes between 30 to 50~\\AA$^3$ at $n_W=100$.  Droplets of this size coalesce\nwith the main droplet and do not form again during the simulation.  These results emphasize the long\ntime scales required for structural relaxations at lower temperatures.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\scalebox{0.8}{\n      \\includegraphics{freenum_vs_Nwater-v2}\n  }\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:drop_fracW} (Color online) Number of water molecules\n      not in the largest droplet (dashed line, open symbols) or not in any\n      droplet (solid line, filled symbols) at temperatures 377, 452, and\n      603~K and at 377~K using the final 1/3 of the trajectory.\n      }\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Water dynamics}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{msdCOMwaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T5_SI.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{msdCOMwaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T8_SI.pdf}}\\\\\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{powerWaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T5_SI.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{powerWaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T8_SI.pdf}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:msdW} Variation of the mean squared\ndisplacement $\\Delta r_W^2(t)$ of the center of mass of water molecules\nwith time for different number of water molecules and for temperatures $T = 377 K$  (a)\nand $T = 603 K$ (b).\nThe black dashed line indicates the value of the box length squared,\nin the case of of $n_W = 5$.\n(c) and (d): Variation of the exponent of the mean squared displacement curves in (a)\nand (b), respectively.\nFor the sake of readability only curves corresponding to $n_W = 5, 70, 300$ are displayed.\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{msdCOMwaterVsTimeDiffTemp_w300_SI.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:msdW300} Variation of the mean squared\ndisplacement $\\Delta r_W^2(t)$ of the center of mass of water molecules\nwith time for $n_W = 300$ at different temperatures.}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe water dynamics are affected by the fact that water molecules tend to form a droplet.\nThe water dynamics are first quantified using the mean squared\ndisplacement $\\Delta r_W^2$\nof the centers of mass of the single water molecules. This mean squared\ndisplacement is plotted versus time for different water contents\nand for temperature $T=377$ K and $T = 603$ K, in Figs.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a) and (b),\nrespectively.\nThis figure also displays the mean squared displacement of\npure water at the same temperature and pressure.\nThe main result of this figure is that the water dynamics is slowed\ndown significantly at long times in bitumen compared to its counterpart in pure water.\nThis is true at all temperatures, although the slow down is\nlarger at low temperatures.\nSurprisingly, the slow down is larger for large water contents\nthan for low water contents.\nA diffusive regime is eventually reached at long times. The long-time diffusive regime is clearly visible\nat high temperatures and small water contents \nin Figs.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a) and (b). It is also observable\nat the low temperature $T=377$ K\nand for the largest water content $n_W = 300$, for a long enough simulation.\nThis is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:msdW300}, displaying in particular\nthe time evolution of the mean squared displacement of water molecules\nin a single simulation of $0.86$ $\\mu$s with $n_W = 300$ water molecules\nat $T=377$ K.\nThe diffusion constant of the long-time diffusion regime decreases with an increasing\nwater content. This indicates that this regime corresponds to the diffusion of the\nwater droplet inside the bitumen matrix. \nAs the number of molecules increases, the droplet becomes heavier and\nits diffusion constant decreases.\nOf course, in the limit of many water molecules with a droplet\nof bitumen in it, the faster bulk water dynamics would be recovered, but this\nis not the limit studied in this work.\n\nTwo other interesting observations can be made on the\ntime evolution of the mean squared displacement of water molecules\nat shorter time scales.\nThe first observation is that the water dynamics in bitumen are slightly faster than\nthe pure water dynamics at short times, between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$ ns, as\ncan be seen in Figs.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a) and (b).\nThe smaller\nthe number of water molecules, the faster the dynamics at these time scales.\nThe second observation is that at intermediate times, around $10^{-2}$ ns,\nthe water dynamics in bitumen becomes slower than in pure water, but the larger\nthe number of molecules in bitumen, the closer to the bulk water dynamics.\nTo interpret these observations, it is necessary to describe the time evolution\nof the mean squared displacement of water molecules more closely.\nAn informative quantity in this respect is\nthe local exponent $\\alpha(t)$ of the mean squared displacement curve.\nIt is defined as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 18694, "prevtext": "\nwhere $U_{X-Y}^{\\text{inter}}$ is the intermolecular energy between molecules of type $X$ and $Y$.\n\nWith these definitions, the total cohesive energy density $ced$ can be expressed as:\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:cedContrib}\nced = \\frac{1}{V}\\Bigl( \\sum_X \\frac{N_{X}}{\\mathcal{N}_A} ce_{X} + \\sum_{X \\neq Y} \\frac{N_{X} + N_{Y}}{\\mathcal{N}_A} ce_{X-Y} \\Bigr),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"ced=\\frac{1}{V}\\Bigl{(}\\sum_{X}\\frac{N_{X}}{\\mathcal{N}_{A}}ce_{X}+\\sum_{X\\neq&#10;Y%&#10;}\\frac{N_{X}+N_{Y}}{\\mathcal{N}_{A}}ce_{X-Y}\\Bigr{)},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>V</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>X</mi></munder><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udca9</mi><mi>A</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>X</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>\u2260</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow></munder><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>X</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>Y</mi></msub></mrow><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udca9</mi><mi>A</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>Y</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00808.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is increasing logarithmically in base $2$.\nThe time evolution of the local exponent $\\alpha$ is displayed in Figs.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (c) and (d)\nfor temperatures $T = 377$ K and $T = 603$ K, respectively. \nFor the sake of clarity, the case of temperature $T = 377$ K is described in more details,\nresults being qualitatively similar at other temperatures.\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (c), the ballistic motion is clearly visible\nat the beginning and corresponds to $\\alpha = 2$.\nAt time scales around\n$10^{-4}$ ns, the local exponent $\\alpha$ is smaller than $2$ and \ndecreases more as the number of water molecules increases.\nIn other words, when only a few water molecules\nare present in bitumen, it is as if the ballistic regime was maintained for longer times.\nThis could be due to the fact that, as the number of water molecules decreases, water molecules \ninteract with more bitumen molecules, with which the interaction is lower than with other\nwater molecules, maintaining a ballistic\nmotion for longer times.\nIt explains why the water dynamics around $10^{-4}$ ns is slightly faster when the\nnumber of molecules in bitumen is lower, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a).\nAround $10^{-3}$ ns, the regime becomes diffusive in bulk water,\nwhich is characterized by $\\alpha = 1$. It corresponds to diffusion of water molecules\nin water. At this time scale, the regime becomes\nsubdiffusive for water molecules in bitumen. The smaller the number of water molecules\nin bitumen, the earlier the start of the subdiffusive regime. For example,\nfor $n_W = 5$ water molecules, the diffusive regime seen in bulk water is\nnot reached and a subdiffusive regime settles in at $10^{-3}$ ns, whereas\nfor $n_W = 300$ the diffusive regime of bulk water is followed up to $5\\times10^{-3}$ ns.\nThis effect is likely due to water molecules feeling the edge of the water droplet.\nThe bigger the droplet, the later this effect is observed. \nIt explains why at a given time scale around $5\\times10^{-2}$ ns in Fig.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a)\nthe dynamics of water molecules is faster for a larger number of water molecules: they are not yet\naffected by the drop edge.\nAt longer time scales and as already discussed, the water dynamics is governed by the diffusion\nof the water droplet inside bitumen.\nFor large water contents, the final diffusive regime sets in after a long plateau,\nassociated with a local exponent $\\alpha$ close to zero,\nand corresponding to the water droplet being nearly arrested in bitumen.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{corrHbVsTimeDiffNumbWaterT5.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{corrHbVsTimeDiffNumbWaterT6.pdf}}\\\\\n  \n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{corrHbVsTimeDiffNumbWaterT8.pdf}}\n  \n  \\caption{\\label{fig:corrHbond} Variation of the autocorrelation function\n$C_H(t)$ between hydrogen bonds\nwith time for different number of water molecules and temperatures $T = 377 K$ (a),\n$T = 452 K$ (b), and $T = 603 K$ (c).\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo supplement the description of water dynamics in bitumen at\nshort time scales, we looked at the hydrogen bond dynamics.\nHydrogen bonds can be defined using an energetic or a geometric criterion\nin MD.~\\cite{luzar93, marti93}\nWe choose the geometrical definition described in Ref.,~\\cite{marti96}\nadapted to the water model used in this work.\nTo be declared as bonded via a hydrogen bond, two water molecules should comply with the criteria:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The distance between the two oxygen atoms is less than $R_{OO} = 3.6$ \\AA.\n\\item The distance between the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the oxygen atom\nof the other is less than $R_{OH} = 2.45$ \\AA.\n\\item The angle between the oxygen atom of one molecule, the oxygen atom,\nand the hydrogen of atom the other molecule is less than $\\phi = 30$\\degree.\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe used the following definition for the autocorrelation function $C_H(t)$ between\nhydrogen bonds:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 42546, "prevtext": "\nwhere the sum $\\sum_{X \\neq Y}$ is done over all distinct pairs $(X,Y)$\nsuch that $X \\neq Y$.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:potEnergy} (b) shows the variation of the different contributions $ce_X$ and $ce_{X-Y}$\nwith the water content at $T = 377$ K.\nThe contributions involving water molecules, namely \n\n$ce_{\\text{D}-\\text{W}}$ and $ce_{\\text{Ar}-\\text{W}}$,\nare growing with an increasing water content, while\n$ce_{\\text{W}}$ increases slightly. It means that \nthe energetic contribution $N_{\\text{W}} ce_{\\text{W}}$ grows faster than linearly with an increasing water content.\nThis is not so surprising as the addition of one water molecule when only a few water molecules are present\ncauses the whole hydrogen bonded network to reorganise.\nThe other contributions to the cohesive energy stay constant. Consequently, the overall decrease of the cohesive energy\ndensity $ced$ is not due to a decrease of the cohesive energy inside bitumen, but rather\nto an increase in volume. In other words, when water molecules are added, the volume of the system increases,\nsome contributions to the cohesive energy increase,\nbut if bitumen molecules were added instead to match the same volume, the cohesive energy would increase more.\nIn total, the cohesive energy density decreases.\nWhen the temperature increases, the picture is slightly different.\n\n\n\n\nFigures~\\ref{fig:potEnergy} (c) and (d) show the variation of the two cohesive energies $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$\nand $ce_{\\text{D}}$, respectively, with the number of water molecules in the system, for\nthree different temperatures.\nThe cohesive energy $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$ associated to aromatic molecules stays constant with the water\ncontent at all temperatures. However, the cohesive energy $ce_{\\text{D}}$ associated to docosane molecules\ndecreases with the water content at high temperatures. Thus, at high temperatures, the overall\ndecrease of the cohesive energy density $ced$ is due both to an increase in volume and to a decrease\nof the cohesive energy in the docosane part of bitumen.\nThe distinction between docosane and aromatic molecules at high temperatures regarding their\nintrinsic cohesive energy when water is added can be surprising.\nIndeed, the aromatic molecules contain the slightly polar asphaltene\nand resin molecules, which are usually believed to interact more with water~\\cite{mullins2011, gray}\nthan with the apolar saturates.\nIf it was so, the water molecules should be located mainly close to the aromatic molecules,\nreplacing interactions among aromatic molecules by interactions between\nwater and aromatic molecules and thus decreasing the intrinsic cohesive energy of the aromatic molecules. \nThis is not observed. Instead, it is the intrinsic cohesive energy of the docosane molecules\nwhich is lowered, suggesting that water molecules are mainly close to docosane molecules and not to\naromatic molecules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{cohesiveEnergyAllVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{potEnergyEachContribVsNwT5.pdf}}\\\\\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{potEnergyVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{potEnergyDocoVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:potEnergy} (a): Variation of the cohesive energy density $ced$\nwith the number of water molecules $n_W$\nfor different temperatures.\n(b): Variation of each contribution to the cohesive energy density as described\nin Eq.~\\ref{eq:cedContrib} with the number of water molecules for $T = 377$ K.\nThe dashed horizontal lines correspond to the value at $n_W = 5$.\n(c) and (d): Variation of the cohesive energy between aromatic molecules $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$\nand docosane molecules $ce_{\\text{D}}$, respectively, with the number of water molecules $n_W$\nfor different temperatures.\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe idea that water molecules are closer to the saturates than to the\npolar aromatics can be directly checked\nusing radial distribution functions.

This figure shows that\nthe atoms closest to oxygen atoms, except hydrogen atoms from other water molecules,\nare from docosane molecules.\nThis result stays true for other temperatures and other water contents in\nCooee bitumen.\nWe believe that water molecules are closer to docosane molecules than to aromatic molecules\nbecause aromatic molecules are part of the nanoaggregates.\nNanoaggregates are composed of aligned flat aromatic molecules in the simulations. They are also a\nsupramolecular structure identified experimentally in bitumen.~\\cite{mullins2012}\nThe nanoaggregates are held together in the Cooee model by Lennard-Jones interactions\nbetween many aligned united atoms. This can be seen as a model of the $\\pi$-stacking\ninteraction existing between aromatic molecules in real bitumen.\nThe electrostatic interaction between\nthe positively charged hydrogen\nof a water molecule and the slightly negatively charged\nsulfur atom of an asphaltene or resin molecule is negligible\ncompared to the interaction holding the nanoaggregates together.\nThus, water molecules are unlikely to penetrate the nanoaggregates\nand have no other choice than to stay close to the docosane molecules.\nWe would like to stress here that this result could be altered if the\npolarity of the asphaltene and resin molecules is increased enough,\nor if they have the possibility to form hydrogen bonds. However, the\nmolecular structures used in this work for asphaltene and resin molecules\nare believed to be representative.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{rdfWater-Everything_nWater5_T5_SI.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:rdf} Radial distribution function between oxygen atoms in\n water molecules and other atoms\nin other types of molecules for $n_W = 5$ at temperature $T = 377$ K.\nError bars correspond to standard deviation on the data divided by the\nsquare root of the number of independent initial configurations considered.\n\n\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nThe variation of the intrinsic energy of the aromatic molecules $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$\nwith temperature and water content deserves some further discussion.\nAs already mentioned, the aromatic molecules in the Cooee bitumen are known to align in nanoaggregates.\nThe definition\nof the nanoaggregates in the case of Cooee bitumen is detailed in\nRefs.~\\cite{aging, branched} \nIt sums up to the following rule:\ntwo aromatic molecules\nare nearest neighbors in the same nanoaggregate if they are\nwell aligned and close enough.\nMore specifically, this rule is based on three thresholds.\nThe first threshold quantifies how much the molecules should be aligned\nto be declared in the same nanoaggregate.\nThis first threshold imposes boundaries to the angle $\\theta$ between the normal vectors to the aromatic planes\nof two different molecules.

We impose $d_1 \\leq 6$ \\AA$ $.~\\cite{aging}\nTwo molecules far away but in the same plane can have a very low distance $d_1$. This is\nwhy a third threshold is needed.\nThe third threshold imposes a maximum value to the distance $d_2$ between the center of mass\nof the first molecule and the projection\nof the center of mass of the second molecule on the plane of the first molecule.\nWe fix $d_2 \\leq 0.7d_A$ \\AA$ $,~\\cite{aging} where $d_A=13.1$ \\AA\\  is the typical length\nof an asphaltene molecule\n\nin the Cooee model.\nSome nanoaggregates are branched, because the asphaltene molecule\nchosen in the Cooee model has a flat head and a flat body oriented in different directions, and\nboth parts can align with other aromatic molecules. \nThe average number of aromatic molecules inside a nanoaggregate is used to quantify\nthe size of the nanoaggregates.\nThe variation of the nanoaggregate size with the water content is displayed in Fig.~\\ref{fig:clusterSize}\nfor three different temperatures.\nThis figure shows that within error bars and for all temperatures, the nanoaggregate\nsize does not depend on the water content. This is in agreement\nwith the intrinsic cohesive energy of the aromatic molecules being independent of the water content.\nSurprisingly, the variation of the nanoaggregate size with temperature is non-monotonic.\nThis fact has been reported and explained.~\\cite{branched} It is due to two competing effects\nwhen temperature increases: the first effect is the increase of thermal noise which tends to detach\nmolecules from the nanoaggregates and decrease the nanoaggregate size; the second effect is the\nrelative increase of the number of asphaltene molecules inside the nanoaggregates compared to other molecule\ntypes, which tends to increase the degree of branching of the aggregates and also their size.\nThe non-monotonic behavior of the cohesive energy $ce_{\\text{Ar}}$ between aromatic\nmolecules is due to the same cause.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{clusterSizeVsNwDiffTemp.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:clusterSize} Variation of the average number of aromatic molecules $\\langle N_{\\text{mol}}\\rangle$\n with the number of water molecules $n_W$\nfor different temperatures.

The distribution of droplet volumes under all conditions are\nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}.  The y-axis indicates the probability\nthat a volume $V$ of water can be found within droplets of volume between $V$\nand $V + dV/V$;\nit is normalized so $\\int P(V) d\\ln V = 1$.  Results at 377~K\nshow that a range of droplet sizes can occur.  While most volume is usually\nfound in a single large droplet, significant numbers of cases were found with\nmultiple droplets with volumes between 90 and 200~\\AA$^3$ for the $n_w=300$\nsystem.  Similar results were found for $n_w = 200$ to 70 water molecules.\nOnly a single large droplet was typical for systems with fewer than 70 water\nmolecules.\n\n\\par \nResults at 452~K differ in that only a single droplet size was prevalent at\neach composition.  This potentially reflects better equilibration of the\nbitumen--water phase behavior due to faster water diffusion over nanosecond\ntime scales (see below).\n\n\\par \nResults at 603~K show a qualitative difference.  A broad distribution of drop\nsizes over a 1 to 70~\\AA$^3$ range is present at all water compositions.  For\n$n_w\\le 40$, most volume is found within states of $V < 1$~\\AA$^3$.  These\ncorrespond to individual water molecules.  \n\n\n\nCoalescence into larger droplets occurred for $n_w = 100$ and larger, though\nmore water molecules remained outside the largest droplet than in the 377 and\n452~K cases.\n\n\\par \n\nTwo measures of the droplet volume are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vavg}.\nSolid lines indicate the total volume of Delaunay tetrahedra that constitute\nlarge water droplets ($V\\ge 1$~\\AA$^3$).  Dashed lines indicate the volume of only the largest\ndroplet. Error bars indicate standard deviations on the size of the largest\ndroplet present, averaged over all configurations considered.\n\nThe total droplet volume increases approximately linearly with the number of\nwater molecules in the system.  Deviations from linearity are most notable at\nthe highest temperature for the smaller numbers of water molecules,\ni.e.\\ the cases that are dominated by an absence of coalesced droplets.\nLinearity indicates a homogeneous water environment as the number of water\nmolecules increases.\n\nThe average volumes of only the largest droplets indicate differences among\nthe three temperatures that are consistent with the volume distributions.\nMany drops are present in the 603~K\ncase, leading to the largest drop containing only a small to moderate fraction\nof the total drop volume until a large number of water molecules are present\n(mass fraction of ca.~1.6\\%).  Some cases of multiple droplets at\n377~K lead to similar but much smaller effects at that temperature at larger\nnumbers of water molecules. The larger error bars at high $n_W$ for both\n  temperatures are a consequence of the volume differences for the largest\n  droplet  when 2 or more droplets are present, such as 220~\\AA$^3$\n  vs.\\ 180~\\AA$^3$ in the case of 1 or 2 droplets at 377~K with $n_W=300$ \n  (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}).\nResults at 452~K show a more predominant\noccurrence of a single large droplet. Cases of multiple large droplets\nwere sufficiently rare at this temperature to lead to negligible\ndifferences between the average\nvolume of the largest droplet and of all large droplets.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\scalebox{0.5}{\n   \\includegraphics{size_distrib_LNnormalized-v3}\n   }\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:drop_Vdistrib} (Color online)\n      Volume-weighted distribution of droplet volumes at $T=377$, 452, and 603~K.\n      Separate distributions are computed for each number of water molecules.\n      Dotted lines indicate results at 377~K using only the final\n          1/3 of each trajectory.\n      }\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\scalebox{0.8}{\n  \\includegraphics{size_vs_Nwater-v5}\n  }\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:drop_Vavg} (Color online)\n      Average volume of the largest droplet (open symbols, dashed lines) and\n      of all large droplets (closed symbols, solid lines) at temperatures 377,\n      452, and 603~K and at 377~K using the final 1/3 of the trajectory.\n\n      }\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\par\nThe division of water molecules between large droplets and dispersed molecules\nwas also determined from the geometric analysis.\nThe number of water molecules that are not\nin droplets of $V > 1$~\\AA$^3$ are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_fracW} by\nsolid lines. It corresponds to the number of free water molecules.\nError bars indicate standard deviations across all configurations.\nEssentially all water molecules\nare in droplets at 377~K, and the number of free water molecules increases\nwith temperature. At 377 and 452~K, the number of free water\nmolecules decreases as the total number of water molecules increases \nbeyond $n_W=10$ in the\nsimulations. \nAt 603~K, most water molecules are free for concentrations up to\n$n_W=40$, then the number reaches a peak and decreases as the water\nconcentration increases further.  These results indicate that additional water\nmolecules add to the largest droplet.  This is consistent with a shift in the\ndroplet size distribution to larger volumes, as seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}.\n\nDashed lines indicate the number of water molecules that are not in the\nlargest droplet. Error bars indicate the standard deviation in the\n  number of water molecules that {\\em are} in the largest droplet; it applies\n  to counting those not in the largest droplet because the number of molecules\n  is constant in each simulation.\nResults at 603~K differ qualitatively by showing a large\nfraction of water molecules at all concentrations that are not in \nthe largest droplet.  This constitutes more than half of the water molecules \nfor systems with up to 100 water molecules. Results at 452~K show\n  essentially all water molecules belonging to a single large droplet.\n\n\\par\nDifferences between 377 and 452~K are suggested by the results\nat higher numbers of water molecules.  Multiple droplets exist at 377~K\n  for $n_W=100$ and larger when averaged over the entire simulation trajectory,\n  which is consistent with the multiple peaks shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}. \n  This leads to a significant number of water molecules outside of the\n  largest droplet.  However, further analysis shows that when multiple\n    droplets exist in cases of $n_W=40$ or more, they\n are present initially and coalesce into fewer droplets as\n  the simulation proceeds. This suggests that a longer\n  equilibration period would lead to one large droplet being predominant at\n  377~K, as is found at 452~K.\n\n\\par \nTo test this idea, the 377~K results were reanalyzed by using only the final\none third of the structures in each production run.  Results are shown by\ndotted lines.  The volume of the largest droplet (Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vavg})\nshifts toward the volume of all large droplets as a consequence of \ndroplets coalescing.  Similarly, the number of water molecules not in the\nlargest droplet decreases (Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_fracW}).  Changes in\nthe size distributions (Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib}) are less apparent, in\npart because of the wide volume scale.  A clear change is the loss of droplet\nvolumes between 30 to 50~\\AA$^3$ at $n_W=100$.  Droplets of this size coalesce\nwith the main droplet and do not form again during the simulation.  These results emphasize the long\ntime scales required for structural relaxations at lower temperatures.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\scalebox{0.8}{\n      \\includegraphics{freenum_vs_Nwater-v2}\n  }\n    \\caption{\\label{fig:drop_fracW} (Color online) Number of water molecules\n      not in the largest droplet (dashed line, open symbols) or not in any\n      droplet (solid line, filled symbols) at temperatures 377, 452, and\n      603~K and at 377~K using the final 1/3 of the trajectory.\n      }\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Water dynamics}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{msdCOMwaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T5_SI.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{msdCOMwaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T8_SI.pdf}}\\\\\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{powerWaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T5_SI.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{powerWaterVsTimeDiffNumbWater_T8_SI.pdf}}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:msdW} Variation of the mean squared\ndisplacement $\\Delta r_W^2(t)$ of the center of mass of water molecules\nwith time for different number of water molecules and for temperatures $T = 377 K$  (a)\nand $T = 603 K$ (b).\nThe black dashed line indicates the value of the box length squared,\nin the case of of $n_W = 5$.\n(c) and (d): Variation of the exponent of the mean squared displacement curves in (a)\nand (b), respectively.\nFor the sake of readability only curves corresponding to $n_W = 5, 70, 300$ are displayed.\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{msdCOMwaterVsTimeDiffTemp_w300_SI.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:msdW300} Variation of the mean squared\ndisplacement $\\Delta r_W^2(t)$ of the center of mass of water molecules\nwith time for $n_W = 300$ at different temperatures.}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe water dynamics are affected by the fact that water molecules tend to form a droplet.\nThe water dynamics are first quantified using the mean squared\ndisplacement $\\Delta r_W^2$\nof the centers of mass of the single water molecules. This mean squared\ndisplacement is plotted versus time for different water contents\nand for temperature $T=377$ K and $T = 603$ K, in Figs.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a) and (b),\nrespectively.\nThis figure also displays the mean squared displacement of\npure water at the same temperature and pressure.\nThe main result of this figure is that the water dynamics is slowed\ndown significantly at long times in bitumen compared to its counterpart in pure water.\nThis is true at all temperatures, although the slow down is\nlarger at low temperatures.\nSurprisingly, the slow down is larger for large water contents\nthan for low water contents.\nA diffusive regime is eventually reached at long times. The long-time diffusive regime is clearly visible\nat high temperatures and small water contents \nin Figs.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a) and (b). It is also observable\nat the low temperature $T=377$ K\nand for the largest water content $n_W = 300$, for a long enough simulation.\nThis is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:msdW300}, displaying in particular\nthe time evolution of the mean squared displacement of water molecules\nin a single simulation of $0.86$ $\\mu$s with $n_W = 300$ water molecules\nat $T=377$ K.\nThe diffusion constant of the long-time diffusion regime decreases with an increasing\nwater content. This indicates that this regime corresponds to the diffusion of the\nwater droplet inside the bitumen matrix. \nAs the number of molecules increases, the droplet becomes heavier and\nits diffusion constant decreases.\nOf course, in the limit of many water molecules with a droplet\nof bitumen in it, the faster bulk water dynamics would be recovered, but this\nis not the limit studied in this work.\n\nTwo other interesting observations can be made on the\ntime evolution of the mean squared displacement of water molecules\nat shorter time scales.\nThe first observation is that the water dynamics in bitumen are slightly faster than\nthe pure water dynamics at short times, between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$ ns, as\ncan be seen in Figs.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a) and (b).\nThe smaller\nthe number of water molecules, the faster the dynamics at these time scales.\nThe second observation is that at intermediate times, around $10^{-2}$ ns,\nthe water dynamics in bitumen becomes slower than in pure water, but the larger\nthe number of molecules in bitumen, the closer to the bulk water dynamics.\nTo interpret these observations, it is necessary to describe the time evolution\nof the mean squared displacement of water molecules more closely.\nAn informative quantity in this respect is\nthe local exponent $\\alpha(t)$ of the mean squared displacement curve.\nIt is defined as\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha (t) = \\frac{{\\mathrm{log}}{\\Delta r_W^2(t)}-{\\mathrm{log}}{\\Delta r_W^2(t-\\Delta t)}}{{\\mathrm{log}}{(t)}-{\\mathrm{log}}{(t-\\Delta t)}},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\alpha(t)=\\frac{{\\mathrm{log}}{\\Delta r_{W}^{2}(t)}-{\\mathrm{log}}{\\Delta r_{W%&#10;}^{2}(t-\\Delta t)}}{{\\mathrm{log}}{(t)}-{\\mathrm{log}}{(t-\\Delta t)}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>r</mi><mi>W</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>r</mi><mi>W</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00808.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $h_{ij}(t_0, t) = 1$ if the two water molecules $i$ and $j$ have been bonded without\nany breaking between time $t_0$ and time $t$\nand $h_{ij}(t_0, t) = 0$ otherwise.

The more water molecules in bitumen,\nthe closer to the correlation function of bulk water.\nIt means that the droplet formed when the total number of water molecules\n$n_W$ is low is stiffer than in bulk water.\nThe same result is shown in another form in Fig.~\\ref{fig:halfTime},\ndisplaying the variation of the half lifetime $\\tau_{1/2}$ \nwith the number of water molecules $n_W$ at different temperatures.\nThe half lifetime $\\tau_{1/2}$ is defined as usual by $C_H(\\tau_{1/2}) = 0.5$.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:halfTime} shows that the lifetime of a hydrogen bond\nat the lowest temperature is around $1$ ps, which is in agreement\nwith other simulation~\\cite{marti96} and experimental~\\cite{woutersen} results.\nAt these time scales, according to Fig.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a),\nthe mean squared displacement of water molecules in the small stiff droplet is higher\nthan that of bulk water.\nFor a higher temperature $T = 452$ K a similar trend is observed:\nthe higher the total number of water molecules $n_W$, the smaller the half lifetime $\\tau_{1/2}$.\nAt temperature $T = 603$ K, the inverse trend is observed.\nTo explain this, one can note that the cases of a total number of water molecules $n_W = 5$ \nat $T = 452$ K and $T = 603$ K, and $n_W = 10$ at $T = 603$ K\nare singled out. The error bars on these results are quite large, because the initial\nnumber of water molecules linked by a hydrogen bond is low at these high temperatures\nand for such low numbers of water molecules. Indeed, Fig.~\\ref{fig:drop_Vdistrib} shows that\nthe fraction of free water molecules in these 3 cases is very high.\nThis leads to poor statistics\non the correlation function and the overall results that these bonds do not last.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{halfTimeVsNw.pdf}\n  \\caption{\\label{fig:halfTime} Variation of the half lifetime of an hydrogen bond\n$\\tau_{1/2}$ with the number of water molecules $n_W$\nfor different temperatures.

But at temperature $T = 377$ K, this loss is due mainly\nto the fact that the interactions with water molecules do not increase enough to\ncounteract the increase in volume.\nAt very high temperatures, the overall loss of cohesion is also due\nto a loss of cohesion among the saturates molecules. The internal cohesion and structure of the aromatic\nmolecules, assembled into nanoaggregates, are unchanged as the water content increases.\n\n(ii) The water molecules tend to form a droplet, which is mainly located next\n  to saturates.  Most water is in a single large droplet at 452~K, while\n  some smaller droplets occurred initially at 377~K.  A main droplet becomes dominant\n  at 603~K only for the higher water concentrations studied. The number of\n  water molecules outside the largest droplet reaches a plateau as the water\n  concentration increases.\n  The droplet volume increases linearly with the\n  number of water molecules in the entire system.\n\n\n(iii) The structure and dynamics of the water molecules are deeply affected\nby the presence of bitumen.  At long times,\nthe water molecules reach a diffusive behavior, but it is governed\nby the diffusion of the water droplet. The diffusion constant is consequently\nmuch lower than that of bulk water and decreases as the droplet mass increases.\nAt short times, the hydrogen bond lifetime is higher in bitumen than in pure water\nat temperature $T = 377$ K and for a small number of water molecules. The droplet is stiff.\nWhen the number of water molecules increases, the hydrogen bond breaking of bulk water is recovered.\nOn the contrary, at very high temperatures $T = 603$ K, the hydrogen bond dynamics is \nfaster in bitumen containing a small number of water molecules than in bulk water. This is due\nto the fact that at these high temperatures, the water molecules need to be more numerous to form\na hydrogen bonded network.\n\nTwo natural perspectives arise from the conclusions just drawn. The first one\nis to describe in more detail the dynamics of free water molecules. How long\ndo they spend outside the main droplet? How far can they go?\nThe second perspective is to study how the water structure and dynamics are affected\nin the presence of hydrophilic surfaces such as those of filler particles and aggregates.\nHow many water molecules are left in bitumen in this case? How fast do the water\nmolecules reach the hydrophilic surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\providecommand*{\\mcitethebibliography}{\\thebibliography}\n\\csname @ifundefined\\endcsname{endmcitethebibliography}\n{\\let\\endmcitethebibliography\\endthebibliography}{}\n\\begin{mcitethebibliography}{32}\n\\providecommand*{\\natexlab}[1]{#1}\n\\providecommand*{\\mciteSetBstSublistMode}[1]{}\n\\providecommand*{\\mciteSetBstMaxWidthForm}[2]{}\n\\providecommand*{\\mciteBstWouldAddEndPuncttrue}\n  {\\def\\EndOfBibitem{\\unskip.}}\n\\providecommand*{\\mciteBstWouldAddEndPunctfalse}\n  {\\let\\EndOfBibitem\\relax}\n\\providecommand*{\\mciteSetBstMidEndSepPunct}[3]{}\n\\providecommand*{\\mciteSetBstSublistLabelBeginEnd}[3]{}\n\\providecommand*{\\EndOfBibitem}{}\n\\mciteSetBstSublistMode{f}\n\\mciteSetBstMaxWidthForm{subitem}\n{(\\emph{\\alph{mcitesubitemcount}})}\n\\mciteSetBstSublistLabelBeginEnd{\\mcitemaxwidthsubitemform\\space}\n{\\relax}{\\relax}\n\n\\bibitem[Airey \\emph{et~al.}(2008)Airey, Collop, Zoorob, and Elliott]{airey}\nG.~D.

It corresponds to diffusion of water molecules\nin water. At this time scale, the regime becomes\nsubdiffusive for water molecules in bitumen. The smaller the number of water molecules\nin bitumen, the earlier the start of the subdiffusive regime. For example,\nfor $n_W = 5$ water molecules, the diffusive regime seen in bulk water is\nnot reached and a subdiffusive regime settles in at $10^{-3}$ ns, whereas\nfor $n_W = 300$ the diffusive regime of bulk water is followed up to $5\\times10^{-3}$ ns.\nThis effect is likely due to water molecules feeling the edge of the water droplet.\nThe bigger the droplet, the later this effect is observed. \nIt explains why at a given time scale around $5\\times10^{-2}$ ns in Fig.~\\ref{fig:msdW} (a)\nthe dynamics of water molecules is faster for a larger number of water molecules: they are not yet\naffected by the drop edge.\nAt longer time scales and as already discussed, the water dynamics is governed by the diffusion\nof the water droplet inside bitumen.\nFor large water contents, the final diffusive regime sets in after a long plateau,\nassociated with a local exponent $\\alpha$ close to zero,\nand corresponding to the water droplet being nearly arrested in bitumen.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{corrHbVsTimeDiffNumbWaterT5.pdf}}\n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{corrHbVsTimeDiffNumbWaterT6.pdf}}\\\\\n  \n  \\subfigure[]{\\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{corrHbVsTimeDiffNumbWaterT8.pdf}}\n  \n  \\caption{\\label{fig:corrHbond} Variation of the autocorrelation function\n$C_H(t)$ between hydrogen bonds\nwith time for different number of water molecules and temperatures $T = 377 K$ (a),\n$T = 452 K$ (b), and $T = 603 K$ (c).\n}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo supplement the description of water dynamics in bitumen at\nshort time scales, we looked at the hydrogen bond dynamics.\nHydrogen bonds can be defined using an energetic or a geometric criterion\nin MD.~\\cite{luzar93, marti93}\nWe choose the geometrical definition described in Ref.,~\\cite{marti96}\nadapted to the water model used in this work.\nTo be declared as bonded via a hydrogen bond, two water molecules should comply with the criteria:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The distance between the two oxygen atoms is less than $R_{OO} = 3.6$ \\AA.\n\\item The distance between the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the oxygen atom\nof the other is less than $R_{OH} = 2.45$ \\AA.\n\\item The angle between the oxygen atom of one molecule, the oxygen atom,\nand the hydrogen of atom the other molecule is less than $\\phi = 30$\\degree.\n\\end{enumerate}\nWe used the following definition for the autocorrelation function $C_H(t)$ between\nhydrogen bonds:\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nC_H(t) = \\frac{\\langle h_{ij}(t_0, 0) h_{ij}(t_0, t)\\rangle}{\\langle h_{ij}(t_0, 0)\\rangle},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"C_{H}(t)=\\frac{\\langle h_{ij}(t_{0},0)h_{ij}(t_{0},t)\\rangle}{\\langle h_{ij}(t%&#10;_{0},0)\\rangle},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>H</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mrow><msub><mi>h</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>h</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mrow><msub><mi>h</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
