In physical contexts, classical as well as quantum, networks are used to describe a wide range of phenomena, such as phase transitions, intricate aspects of many-body quantum systems or even characteristic features of a future quantum internet. Random quantum networks and their associated directed graphs are employed for capturing statistically dominant features of complex\nquantum systems. Here, we develop an efficient iterative method capable of evaluating the probability of a graph being strongly connected. It is proven that random directed graphs with constant edge-establishing probability are typically strongly connected, i.e. any ordered pair of vertices is connected by a directed path. This typical topological property of directed random graphs is exploited to demonstrate universal features of the asymptotic evolution of large random qubit networks. These results are independent of our knowledge of the details of the network topology. These findings suggest that also other highly complex networks, such as a future quantum internet, may exhibit similar universal properties.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nNetworks are important models of dynamical systems both in quantum and classical physics with applications ranging from many-body physics and communication technology\nto social sciences and economics \\cite{Barabasi2002,Cohen2010,Newman2001}. The rapid advancement of quantum information technology \\cite{Bruss2007} has stimulated considerable interest in dynamical properties of quantum networks formed by elementary systems, such as qubits, in view of their privileged role in quantum communication and quantum computation \\cite{Chuang2000}.\n\nIn particular, qubit based quantum networks may even model\ncharacteristic features of a future quantum internet and of the resulting intricate possibilities of generating and distributing entanglement among its nodes. In a typical model of a quantum internet \\cite{Preskill1999,Kimble2008,Hughes2013,Bussieres2014} distinguishable quantum systems, such as material qubits realized by trapped ions or atoms, are coupled by photon exchange through optical fibers. These nodes may influence each other by directed entanglement operations which typically\ninvolve a control and a target system and are thus representable by directed links.\nAt any time the 'users' of such a quantum internet can establish links between these nodes. From the point of view of the physical systems constituting the nodes the establishment of 'user'-controlled connections and subsequently executed entanglement operations\nmay appear random so that a quantum internet may be viewed as\na paradigm of a random quantum communication network.\nOther important examples of quantum networks include systems and processes encountered in quantum statistical physics\nwhich involve approaches to equilibria or stationary states in macroscopic systems.\n\n\nRecently, intriguing relations between properties of quantum communication networks with prescribed lattice topologies and statistical physics have been reported. Based on classical percolation concepts \\cite{Broadbent1957,Grimmett1999,Bollobas2006} it has been shown \\cite{Acin2007} that these quantum networks may exhibit an entanglement percolation phase transition \\cite{Sachdev1999}. Accordingly, it requires a minimal critical amount of local entanglement in order to establish an almost perfect distant quantum channel through such a network. This early result on quantum networks and its connection to statistical physics \\cite{Acin2007} stimulates natural questions concerning the existence and character of topological and dynamical properties of other quantum networks.\n\nHere we address two such questions elucidating characteristic properties of quantum networks with randomly established links and\nwithout any particular prescribed lattice topology \\cite{Acin2007}.\nThe first question addresses the random establishment of directed links which may capture the asymmetric role played by\ncontrol and target nodes in entanglement creating operations, for example:\nWhat is the typical topological structure of random networks with\ndirected links which can be established with equal probability between any two nodes?\nAnswering this question constitutes a first step\ntowards an understanding of generic features of entanglement generation and distribution within such random quantum networks. For this purpose we develop an iterative method for determining\nthe probability that a random directed graph describing such a random network is strongly connected for any edge-establishing probability $p$. As a main result it is demonstrated that almost certainly a sufficiently large random network with directed\nlinks is strongly connected, i.e. there is always at least one closed\ndirected path through any pair of nodes. Our second question addresses\nconsequences of this typical topological property on\ndynamical features: Does this typical topological\nproperty imply universal asymptotic dynamical features on randomly generated quantum networks? Based on previous results\n\\cite{Novotny2010,Novotny2011} it is demonstrated that such universal properties arise. As an example the asymptotic dynamics of iteratively and randomly applied entanglement operations is investigated and it is shown that it is independent of most of the details of the underlying randomly generated qubit network. In particular the individual connectivity of the networks nodes is not the crucial feature for the asymptotics.\n\nThis\n paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \\ref{chapter 2}\nthe iterative procedure is presented for evaluating the probability that a random directed graph with constant edge-generating probability $p$ is strongly connected. Based on this result in chapter \\ref{chapter_3}\nthe asymptotic dynamics of qubit networks with random unitary evolution is studied. In particular, two different scenarios are investigated, namely a static random network and a dynamically changing random quantum network.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Strong connectivity of large random directed graphs}\n\\label{chapter 2}\nIn this section we\ninvestigate the connectivity of random directed graphs which describe random\nnetworks with a constant edge-generating probability $p$.\nAs a main result the probabilistic dominance of strongly connected directed graphs\nis proven in the limit of large networks.\n\nThe set of all networks with $n$ nodes is characterized\nby the set of their associated\ndirected graphs ${\\sf G}(n)$. A graph $g({\\sf V}, {\\sf E}) \\in {\\sf G}(n)$ is defined by its set of vertices ${\\sf V}$ representing\nthe network's\n nodes and by the set of directed edges ${\\sf E}$ representing\nthe network's\ndirected links.\nA complete graph ${\\mathcal{C}}$ contains all its $n(n-1)$ possible directed edges. We focus on directed graphs in order to be able to take into account that any pair of nodes of the network can be linked in an asymmetric way as in the case of an entanglement operation with a control and a target system. A path in a graph is an ordered set of adjacent edges. A graph is strongly connected if there is at least one closed path through any pair of vertices (compare with Fig. \\ref{fig1}). Random graphs are a convenient tool for exploring statistical properties of complex networks. They are defined by a probability distribution on the set ${\\sf G}(n)$. In the following we concentrate on random graphs in which all directed $n(n-1)$ edges are treated identically,\ni.e. the links are selected randomly and statistically independently with probability $p>0$. Thus ${\\sf G}(n,p)$ is the set of directed random\ngraphs ${\\sf G}(n)$ of Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi type \\cite{Erdos1959,Bollobas2001} equipped with the corresponding binomial probability distribution.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig1.pdf}\n\\caption{Examples of directed graphs: {\\bf a} - a\nstrongly connected cyclic graph, {\\bf b} - a\nstrongly connected star graph, {\\bf c} - a\nstrongly connected complete graph ${\\mathcal{C}}$, {\\bf d} - a\nnon-strongly connected graph with two strongly connected components\n(grey and blue areas).\n} \\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nA way of classifying topologically the set of random graphs ${\\sf G}(n,p)$ is to determine the probability $P_C(n,p)$ of a random graph $g \\in {\\sf G}(n,p)$ to be strongly connected. This is a challenging graph theoretical problem already for the simpler case of undirected graphs. It has not yet been solved completely \\cite{Harary1973,Pittel2012}. In order to tackle this problem we have developed an iterative procedure for evaluating this topological graph theoretical quantity $P_C(n,p)$. Details of this\nrecurrence procedure are described in the subsequent section.\n\n\\subsection{Probability of strong connectedness $P_C(n,p)$}\n\\label{chapter_2a}\nLet us consider directed random graphs with $n$ vertices whose probability of establishing an arbitrary link between any pair of these vertices is given by $0 < p < 1$. The probability that such a graph is not strongly connected is denoted by $P_D(n,p) = 1 - P_C(n,p)$. Any of these directed graphs\ncan be uniquely decomposed into maximal strongly connected subgraphs, so-called strongly connected dicomponents (SCD). Unlike in undirected graphs these dicomponents may be interconnected provided that connections between different SCDs do not form a directed loop. Note that while each strongly connected graph consists of a single SCD only any non strongly connected or disconnected graph\nwith $n$ vertices consists of at least two SCDs. Each of them has strictly less than $n$ vertices.\n\nBased on these characteristic properties the whole set of directed disconnected graphs with $n$ vertices and its associated probability can be constructed\nby a recursive algorithm described in the following. For this purpose let us choose a partition $\\{n\\}_k$ of the number of vertices $n$ with length $k \\geq 2$. This is a distribution of $n$ vertices into $k$ components described by a decreasing sequence of natural numbers, i.e. $\\{n\\}_k \\equiv \\{n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_k\\}$ summing up to $n$. Thereby each partition describes one possible decomposition of $n$ vertices into $k$ SCDs.\nAs different links are selected in a statistically independent way the probability that each of  these $k$ SCDs is strongly connected is given\nby the product of the probabilities $P_C(n_i,p); i=1,...,k$. In general, in a disconnected graph these $k$ SCDs may\nbe interconnected by directed edges which, however, must not form a closed directed loop. Let us denote the probability that these edges do not form a closed directed loop by $P_A(\\{n\\}_k,p)$. Taking into account all possible distributions of labeled vertices into at least two\nSCDs we can determine the probability $P_D(n,p)$ of a directed graph with $n$ vertices being disconnected, i.e.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{recurrent_probability_scg}\nP_D(n,p)&=&\\sum_{\\{n\\}_k \\in {\\mathcal{K}}} K(\\{n\\}_k) \\prod_i P_C(n_i,p) \\times P_A(\\{n\\}_k,p).\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe summation includes all possible partitions ${\\mathcal{K}}$ of $n$ vertices with\na minimum length of two. The number $K(\\{n\\}_k)$ of possible decompositions of $n$ labeled vertices  within the same partition $\\{n\\}_k$\ncan be calculated in a straightforward way.\nHowever, the determination of the probability $P_A(\\{n\\}_k,p)$ is a formidable combinatorial problem which can also be achieved by\na recursive procedure described in the following.\n\nThis recursive procedure starts from the observation\nthat the absence of any directed loop between different SCDs\nimplies the existence of at least one SCD which is not adjacent to any outgoing edge connecting it with any other SCD, i.e.  it is not adjacent to any interconnecting edge between different SCDs whose tail lies in this SCD.\nSeparating this SCD from the rest, the residual SCDs also cannot be interconnected by a directed loop. In principle each SCD of the original set of SCDs could be non-adjacent to any outgoing interconnecting edge into the residual SCDs. Correspondingly, an upper bound on the probability $P_A(\\{n\\}_k,p))$\nis given by  the sum of probabilities associated with all these (not necessarily exclusive) possibilities, i.e.\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{expression_acyclic_graphs}\n P_A\\left(\\{n\\}_k,p\\right) &\\leq & \\sum_{\\{m\\}_1 \\subset {\\{n\\}_k}} (1-p)^{m(n-m)} P_A\\left(\\{n\\}_k / \\{m\\}_1,p\\right).\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThereby, a  SCD with $m$ vertices and without any outgoing edge is represented by\na partition $\\{m\\}_1$ of unit length and the residual SCDs are represented by the partition\n$\\{n\\}_k /\\{m\\}_1$ of length $k-1$. The probability of such a graph is given by the product of\nthe probability $P_A\\left(\\{n\\}_k/\\{m\\}_1,p\\right)$ that the residual SCDs are not strongly connected with\nthe probability $(1-p)^{m(n-m)}$ that the chosen SCD with $m$ vertices does not have any outgoing edge.\nThe summation in Eq.(\\ref{expression_acyclic_graphs}) includes all $k$ SCDs of the partition $\\{n\\}_k$.\nThus, it takes into account situations with two or more SCDs, which do not have any outgoing edges, more than once. In order to obtain not only an upper bound but a precise expression for the probability\n$P_A(\\{n\\}_k,p)$ we have to compensate for this overcounting. This can be achieved by subtracting the probabilities describing situations with two SCDs without any outgoing edges, adding the probabilities of situations with three SCDs without any outgoing edges and so on. This way we eventually obtain the recurrence relation\n\\begin{widetext}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{probability_acyclic_graphs}\nP_A\\left(\\{n\\}_k,p\\right) =  \\sum_{l < k, \\{m\\}_l \\subset {\\{n\\}_k}} (-1)^{l-1}(1-p)^{m(n-m)+\\sum_{i\\neq j}m_i m_j} P_A\\left(\\{s\\}_{k-l},p\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\end{widetext}\nfor the probability that the SCDs described by the partition $\\{n\\}_k$\ndo not contain any closed directed loops connecting them.\nThe partition $\\{s\\}_{k-l} \\equiv \\{n\\}_k / \\{m\\}_l$ refers to the distribution of vertices of the residual $k-l$ SCDs after $l$ SCDs without outgoing links to these $k-l$ SCDs have been separated off.  The sum covers all possible partitions of legth $l$ described  by the partitions\n$\\{m\\}_l$ and chosen from the original partition $\\{n\\}_k$. From the recurrence relations (\\ref{recurrent_probability_scg}) and (\\ref{probability_acyclic_graphs}) the probability of a random graph being disconnected and its complementary probability $P_C(n,p)$ can be determined recursively.\n\n\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n\\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\bfseries $n$ & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5& 6& 7\\\\\n\\hline\n\\bfseries $P_C(n,1/2)$ & 0.25& 0.3438 & 0.4331 & 0.5742 & 0.7049 & 0.8114\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Probability $P_C(n,p=1/2)$ of a graph being strongly connected.}\n\\label{table_number_scg}\n\\end{table}\n\nEmploying this recurrence procedure\n we can calculate the probability $P_C(n,p)$.\nIn Table \\ref{table_number_scg} values of $P_C(n,p)$ are shown for $p=1/2$ and for small values of $n$. These results indicate that for small numbers of vertices $n$ it is more likely for a random graph to be non-strongly connected. However, already for $n > 5$ it is more likely that a random graph is strongly connected. In Fig.\\ref{fig2} the probability $P_C(n,p)$ is depicted\nfor various numbers of vertices $n$ and probabilities $p$ of randomly establishing edges. It is apparent that with increasing numbers of vertices $n$ the probability $P_C(n,p)$ approaches unity for any probability\n$p$. Fig.\\ref{fig2} suggests a general topological result: In the limit of sufficiently large networks a randomly selected directed graph  $g \\in {\\sf G}({\\sf n},p)$ is almost certainly strongly connected.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{fig2.pdf}\n\\caption{Probability $P_C\\equiv P_C(n,p)$ for a random directed  graph from the set ${\\sf G}({\\sf V},p)$ to be strongly connected:\n$p=2/3$ (full, blue), $p=1/2$ (dotted, red), $p=3/7$ (dash-dotted, green), $p=2/5$ (circle, black), $p=1/3$ (cross, magenta), $p=1/5$ (diamond, cyan).} \\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs we show in the following part this main result can be further strengthened quantitatively by\na rigorous lower bound of $P_C(n,p)$ which scales exponentially with the number of vertices $n$.\n\n\\subsection{Asymptotic lower bound on $P_C(n,p)$}\n\\label{chapter_2b}\nFor large numbers of vertices $n$ the analysis of the behavior of the probability $P_C(n,p)$ based on the recursive relations\n(\\ref{recurrent_probability_scg}) and (\\ref{probability_acyclic_graphs})\nconstitutes a challenging task \\cite{Alimonti,Gimenez}.

However, due to the probabilistic dominance of strongly connected graphs within the set ${\\sf G}(n,p)$ the randomly selected graph $g$ will almost certainly be strongly connected provided the number of vertices $n$ is sufficiently large. Thus, the universal dynamical property of randomly applied CNOT operations \\cite{Novotny2011} combined with the probabilistic dominance of strong connectedness in randomly generated large\nnetworks yields the following  general result: On a sufficiently large randomly generated $n$-qubit network the iterated asymptotic dynamics of randomly applied CNOT operations almost certainly converges towards the $n$-qubit state\n$\\sigma$ of Eq.(2). This state is uniquely determined by the $n$ qubits involved and is independent of all further details of the  network.\n\n\n\nCharacteristic features demonstrating these universal convergence\nproperties are illustrated in Figs. \\ref{fig45}a,b.\nThereby, the deviations\nof the $r$-th iterate of the quantum operations\n$\\Phi^{(r)}$  and $\\Psi^{(r)}$\nfrom the asymptotic dynamics $\\Phi_g^{(\\infty)}$ of a strongly connected graph $g$\nare investigated. These quantum operations describe\nthe iterated dynamics of a dynamic\nand of a static random network.\nAs a state independent measure of these deviations the Hilbert-Schmidt distances between these quantum operations are depicted for graphs with $n=4$ vertices and with different probabilities of generating directed links.\nFrom Fig. \\ref{fig45}a the strong convergence of the dynamics\nof dynamic random networks towards the asymptotic dynamics\n$\\Phi_g^{(\\infty)}$ of a strongly connected graph $g$ is apparent.\nAs $\\Phi$ can be viewed as a random unitary quantum operation\n$\\Phi_{C}$ on a complete graph $C$\nthis is valid even for small network sizes.\nHowever, as apparent from Fig. \\ref{fig45}b\nthe dynamical convergence properties in static random networks\nare considerably different.\nThis may be traced back to the fact that in these networks\nconvergence is expected for strongly connected graphs only\nand that, according to our main result on random directed graphs,\nstrong connectedness arises as a\ntypical property only for sufficiently large graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\\label{chapter_4}\nIn summary, we have presented a recursive procedure for evaluating the probability\nthat a random directed graph is strongly connected. It reveals\nthat for sufficiently small numbers\nof vertices this probability\nis small. In this mesoscopic regime the asymptotic dynamics of qubit networks coupled by random unitary operations, for example,\n\tdepends strongly on details of the graph characterizing its possible random couplings.\nHowever, large random networks with constant\nlink-generating probability are almost certainly strongly connected.\nThis typical topological property has important dynamical consequences for quantum networks governed by random unitary couplings, such as\nentanglement generating controlled-not operations. Irrespective whether their randomness is\nstatic or dynamic\nthe probabilistic dominance of strongly connected graphs results in a characteristic\nlong time dynamics. It is universal in the sense that all strongly\nconnected qubit networks with the same number of nodes share the same long time dynamics independent of all specific differences beyond their strong connectedness. Provided all links of a large network are established with the same probability, the detailed knowledge of the actual network topology is irrelevant and thus consequently redundant. Our lack of such an information is turned into our favor and the network possess a unique asymptotic evolution.\nIt may be conjectured that similar typical topological properties\nmay also be crucial for capturing the asymptotic\ndynamics of large quantum networks with dynamics different from the controlled-not\noperations considered here. Thus, it is conceivable that even highly complex quantum networks,\nsuch as a future quantum internet, could exhibit analogous universal\ntopological and dynamical properties.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}  JN and IJ received financial support from grants No. RVO 68407700 and GACR 13-33906 S.
