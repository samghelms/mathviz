Low magnetic field of recycled pulsars is\nprobably a result of its damping during preceding\naccretion stage \\cite{bisk74,bisk76}.\n\n\\section{Recycled radiopulsars}\n\nDuring several years after discovery of pulsars only single\nobjects had been found. It was an impression, that pulsars avoid binaries.\nWhen half (or even more) stars are binaries, this phenomena was explained\neither\nby pair disruption during supernova explosion leading to pulsar formation,\nor by absence of SN explosions at the end of evolution of stars in\nclose binaries \\cite{tr}.\n\nDetailed analysis of the fate of close X-ray binaries in low-mass systems,\nnamely Her X-1, was done in \\cite{bisk74}, and the\nconclusion was made that evolution of such system will be ended by formation of\na non-accreting neutron star in close binary, which should become a radio pulsar.\nIt was shown, that neutron star rotation is accelerated\nduring disk accretion stage, so the second time born\n(recycled) radio pulsar should become visible, provided it has a magnetic field\nsimilar to  other single pulsars. Absence of radio pulsars in close binaries,\nin spite of intensive searches could be explained by the only reason: during\naccretion stage the magnetic field of the neutron star is screened by the\ninflowing accreting gas, so the recycled pulsar should have\n$B\\sim 10^8--10^{10}$ Gs, 2-4 orders of magnitude smaller than average field\nstrength of radio pulsars. Discovery of the first binary pulsar \\cite{ht75},\nand subsequent discovery of more than 50 recycled pulsars\n\\cite{lor03,lyn04} had confirmed this conclusion: all recycled pulsars have\nsmall values of magnetic fields, as was predicted in \\cite{bisk74}.\n\nA simple estimation of the magnetic field screening during accretion\nhad shown a large potential possibility of such process.\nIt was estimated in \\cite{bk79} that in absence of\ninstabilities leading to penetration of the\ninfalling plasma into pulsar magnetosphere, the pressure of the accreting gas\nexceeds the magnetic pressure of the dipole with $B=10^{12}$ Gs. already after\none day of accretion at subcritical accretion rate $10^{-9}\\,\\,M_{\\odot}$/year,\nand the original magnetic dipole is completely\ngraved under a plasma layer, and currents in the plasma prevent external\nappearance  of stellar magnetic field.\nIn reality the instability and gas penetration through the magnetosphere make the\nscreening process much slower, and when the penetration layer reaches the\nsurface of the star the external magnetic field strength of the neutron star\ncould reach the stationary state.\n\n From the statistical analysis of 24\nbinary radio pulsars with nearly circular orbits and low mass companions,\nit was discovered \\cite{vdh95} a clear correlation between spin period $P_p$ and\norbital period $P_{orb}$, as\nwell as between the magnetic field and orbital period: pulsar period\nand magnetic field strength increases with the orbital period at\n$P_{orb}>100$ days, and scatters around $P_p\\sim 3$ ms and $B\\sim 2\\cdot 10^8$ Gs\nfor smaller binary periods. These relations strongly\nsuggest that an increase in the amount of accreted mass leads to a decay of the\nmagnetic field, and a 'bottom' field strength of about 10$^8$ G is also\nimplied. Several models of magnetic field screening during accretion had been\nconsidered, see  \\cite{cz98,cz00} and references therein.\nEvolutionary aspects of formation of recycled pulsars are discussed in \\cite{bisk74,ty73},\nand summarized in \\cite{bhav}.\nSeveral scenario had been analyzed in \\cite{bisk74,ty73} for the evolution of binaries,\nmassive enough to produce the neutron star or black hole in one or both remnants.\nDuring the evolution such stars go through stages of different nuclear burning, which\nare ended by formation  of carbon-oxygen white dwarf, or proceeds until formation of\nthe iron - peak elements core, which collapses with formation of the neutron star\nor a black hole. The first born relativistic star (neutron, or black hole) goes through\nthe stage of an accreting binary X-ray source, and the evolution of such system is\nfinished after end of evolution of the second component, and the end of accretion.\nDuring the evolution of massive close binary there are possibilities of a disruption\nof the binary after the first or the second collapse, which may be accompanied by\nexplosion with large mass ejection, or by a kick due to anisotropy in a mass ejection\nor in neutrino flux.\nIt was nevertheless concluded in \\cite{bisk74}, that\n\"evolutionary analysis cannot exclude formation\nof close binary, containing neutron star, and another star on the last evolutionary state\n(white dwarf, neutron star, black hole). Contrary, this analysis indicates to formation\nof such binaries at the end of evolution of sufficiently massive\nsystems with a large probability.\" Same conclusion was obtained in \\cite{ty73}.\nThe absence of discovery of binary pulsars in 1973\nwas unambiguously explained in \\cite{bisk74} as follows:\n\"The absence of radiopulsars in close binaries\nmay be explained if we suggest additionally, that magnetic field of the neutron star is\ndamped during accretion  stage\"\n\nThe probabilistic conclusion about formation of radiopulsars in close binaries was\ndefinitely confirmed in \\cite{bisk74} by the analysis of the evolution of\none of the best learned X-ray pulsars Her X-1. The component of the neutron star\nin this system is a low mass star which will end its life by formation of the\nwhite dwarf, when the pair cannot be disrupted. On the other hand, during\naccretion the neutron star acquires a rapid rotation, and it was shown in\n\\cite{bisk74}, that during the process of termination of accretion the neutron\nstar - X-ray pulsar cannot follow the stationary period, increasing with\ndecreasing of the the accretion rate $\\dot M$, and after the end of accretion\nwill remain to be rather rapidly rotating neutron star with a period\nof the order, or smaller than periods of the known radiopulsars. So, the only\nexplanation of absence of binary radiopulsars in to 1973 year remains their\nfaintness, connected with low magnetic field.\n\nThe first proof of this conclusion came soon by discovery of the first binary\nradiopulsar PSR 1913+16 \\cite{ht75}. This pulsar was a rapidly rotating with a period 0.059 s\nin the close binary with a period 7$^h$45$^m$. Just after the discovery I\nhave identified this object with the old recycled pulsar with low magnetic field\n\\cite{bkp}. Measurements \\cite{T76}\nof the period derivative $\\dot P$, which gave possibility\nto estimate the age of this pulsar $\\tau=\\frac{P}{2\\dot P}\\approx 10^8$ years,\nand magnetic field $B\\approx 2 \\cdot 10^{10}$ Gs had proofed this identification.\nAmong more than 100 recycled pulsars most objects consist of a neutron star with low mass\nwhite dwarf companion, and the systems with two neutron stars, like in PSR 1913+16\nare in minority.\nDouble-neutron-star (DNS) binaries are rare, and only six such systems\nare known. All recycled pulsars, with white\ndwarf or neutron star companions, have magnetic fields $10^8\\, -\\, 10^{10}$,\nso the hypothesis about field damping on the accretion stage seems to be correct.\n\nAnother convincing evidence in favor of magnetic field graving during accretion\nappeared by discovery of the first binary system, containing two\nradiopulsars.\nThe recently discovered 23-ms pulsar J0737$-$3039A  was found to be in a 2.4-hr\neccentric orbit with another compact object that the observed orbital\nparameters suggested was another neutron star \\cite{bdp+03}.\n The 2.8-sec pulsar J0737$-$3039B was discovered \\cite{lyn04}\n as the companion to the  pulsar J0737$-$3039A in a\nhighly-relativistic double-neutron-star system, allowing unprecedented\ntests of fundamental gravitational physics.\nThe short orbital\nperiod and compactness of the system and the high timing precision\nmade possible by the large flux density and narrow pulse features of\nthis pulsar promise to make this system a superb laboratory for the\ninvestigation of relativistic astrophysics. The resulting in-spiral will end in\ncoalescence of the two stars in about 85~My.  This discovery\nsignificantly increases the estimates of the detection rate of DNS\nin-spirals by gravitational wave detectors \\cite{bdp+03}.\nThe clock-like properties of pulsars moving in the gravitational\nfields of their unseen neutron-star companions have allowed unique\ntests of general relativity and provided evidence for gravitational\nradiation.\n\nThe properties of these pulsars fit very well the evolutionary scheme\nof formation of binary pulsars from \\cite{bisk74}. According to this scheme the\n23 ms pulsar had accelerated its rotation during accretion, when its magnetic field\nwas decreased due to screening of the accreting material. The second 2.8 s pulsar\nwas born later in SN explosion, which did not disrupt the pair. Therefore, ms pulsar\nshould be older, and have weaker magnetic field. Indeed, 23 ms pulsar has\n$B= 6.3\\times 10^9$ Gs, and characteristic age $\\tau= 210$ My; and 2.8 s pulsar has\n $B=1.6\\times 10^{12}$ Gs, and $\\tau= 50$ My \\cite{lyn04}.\nThe masses of neutron stars in this binary are estimated as\n1.34 M$_\\odot$ for 23 ms, and 1.25 M$_\\odot$\nfor 2.8 s pulsars.\n\n\\subsection{Magnetic field damping during accretion}\n\nAccretion induced Ohmic heating and dissipation  have been investigated in many works\n(see i.g. references in \\cite{chou02}).\nThis mechanism may work only if the magnetic field is produced by electrical current\nin the outer layers of the accreting neutron star, which may be heated during accretion.\nEvidently, the highly degenerate neutron star core is not sensible to this heating\nand will preserve its very high conductivity. Therefore magnetic field, originated by deep\ninside electrical currents may become weaker only due to screening by the infalling plasma\nduring accretion \\cite{bisk74}.\nDifferent models of magnetic field screening during accretion have\nbeen considered. It is usually accepted that matter is channelized\nby the dipole magnetic field and flows to the magnetic poles of\nthe neutron star \\cite{bisf69,ag}.\n  As the magnetic\nfield of the neutron star decreases because of the screening due to\naccreting material, it is less able to channelize the accretion flow\nand thereby the polar cap widens.  One can easily find out how the\nangular width $\\theta_{\\rm P}$ of the polar cap depends on the surface\nmagnetic field $B_{\\rm s}$ of the neutron star (see, for example, \\cite{shap}).\nThe field line starting from $\\theta_{\\rm P}$\nat the surface of the neutron star, with a radius $r_{\\rm s}$, is the last\nclosed field line of the dipolar field and passes through the Alfv\\'en\nradius $r_{\\rm A}$. It easily follows that\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 3800, "prevtext": "\nFor main sequence\nstellar magnetic field $B_s=10 \\div 100$ Gs, and stellar radius\n$R_s=(3 \\div 10)R_{\\odot}\\approx (2 \\div 7)10^{11}$ cm, we get\n$B_{ns}\\approx 4\\times 10^{11} \\div 5\\times 10^{13}$ Gs, for a neutron star\nradius $R_{ns}=10^6$ cm.

Therefore magnetic field, originated by deep\ninside electrical currents may become weaker only due to screening by the infalling plasma\nduring accretion \\cite{bisk74}.\nDifferent models of magnetic field screening during accretion have\nbeen considered. It is usually accepted that matter is channelized\nby the dipole magnetic field and flows to the magnetic poles of\nthe neutron star \\cite{bisf69,ag}.\n  As the magnetic\nfield of the neutron star decreases because of the screening due to\naccreting material, it is less able to channelize the accretion flow\nand thereby the polar cap widens.  One can easily find out how the\nangular width $\\theta_{\\rm P}$ of the polar cap depends on the surface\nmagnetic field $B_{\\rm s}$ of the neutron star (see, for example, \\cite{shap}).\nThe field line starting from $\\theta_{\\rm P}$\nat the surface of the neutron star, with a radius $r_{\\rm s}$, is the last\nclosed field line of the dipolar field and passes through the Alfv\\'en\nradius $r_{\\rm A}$.

The authors considered cases with very rapid field increase\ndue to percolation during\n$10^3 -- 10^4$ years, up to the initial value which the neutron star had before\nthe start of accretion. Evidently, this conclusion is in contradiction with observation,\nbecause all recycled pulsars which could be very old, even up to $10^{10}$ years\n\\cite{lor03}, have equally small magnetic fields. This contradiction is connected with\nthe artificial model considered in \\cite{mus95}, where the percolation was started\nfrom the depth not more than 260 m, corresponding to the accreted material\nless that $5 \\cdot 10^{-5} M_{\\odot}$. The conductivity in the outer crust of the neutron star\ncould be small enough to permit such a rapid percolation.\nActually, during the accretion phase lasting $10^7 -- 10^8$ years the amount of the accreted\nmaterial is much larger, the magnetic field is buried to much deeper layers with\nmuch higher conductivity. Therefore the outward percolation of the magnetic field in the\nrecycled pulsars should be negligible.\n\n\\subsection{Formation of single recycled pulsars: Enhanced Evaporation}\n\nAmong the pulsars, which can be attributed to the recycled (rapid rotation + low magnetic field)\nthere are many single objects.\nThe mechanism of the pair disruption and formation of a single RP is not quite clear.\nAfter discovery of the first eclipsed radiopulsar it was suggested that the companion\ncould be evaporated \\cite{klu88}, but statistical properties did not confirm it.\nThe concentration of the recycled pulsars\n(RP) to the globular clusters (GC), 47 RP from the total number 103 are situated in\nGC \\cite{lor03}, is very similar to the distribution of low mass X-ray binaries (LMXB).\nTaking into account, that presently the total relative mass of GC in Galaxy is about\n$10^{-3}$ and about one half of LMXB are situated in GC, the relative concentration of\nLBXB in GC is 1000 larger than in the Galaxy \\cite{sh82}. The\nsimilarity of distributions of LMXB and RP may be considered as another evidence\nto their genetic relation \\cite{bisk74,bisk76,rs83}. According to \\cite{lor03} there are\n21 single RP in GC (45\\%), and only 9 single RP in the galactic bulge (16\\%). This evident\nstatistical difference indicates that not only birth of LMXB, but also the disruption\nof the binaries are connected with close stellar encounters, which are much more frequent\nin GC than in the bulge \\cite{bk89}. It was suggested in \\cite{bk89}, that single RP\nin the bulge could be the remnants of the completely evaporated GC, same origin may have\nalso LMXB of the bulge \\cite{bkr83}.\nNumerical simulations made in \\cite{rap89} have shown that only\npairs with large orbital periods 10 -- 100 days could be destroyed by close stellar encounters\nin globular clusters. However, it follows from observations \\cite{lor03}, that RP are usually\nmembers of more close binaries. The solution of this problem may be done by the mechanism of\n\"Enhanced Evaporation\" (EE), suggested in \\cite{bk90}.\n\nIt was shown theoretically in \\cite{gl50} and confirmed later by numerical experiments\n\\cite{aa75}, that stellar encounters of stars with close binaries lead to energy extraction\nfrom the binary and heating of the cluster field stars. Contrary to that, collisions with\nsufficiently wide binary lead to its father widening, and finally to its destruction.\nThis property is interpreted very easily. The kinetic energy exchange between stars\nduring encounter is determined by their velocities, almost independently on their\nsingle or binary origin. Relaxation processes in stellar encounters lead to establishing of\nequipartition of energies of all stars. It means, that star with larger kinetic energy lose it,\nand the one with smaller energy gain it. For single stars it would lead to real equipartition,\nso that stars with larger energies in average loose it, but contrary result takes place if one\nof the encountering objects is a close binary. In close binary star is rapidly rotating on the\norbit. If this rotational energy exceeds the average energy of stars in the cluster there is\nan average energy transfer to the field stars. When the star in the binary loose its\nkinetic energy, its orbit is changing in such a way that is starts to rotate faster than before,\nand the pair becomes tighter. The binary has an effective negative heat capacity, connected\nwith the validity of the virial theorem \\cite{ll62} in the binary system. The net loose of\nthe energy by the pair leads to acceleration of the orbital motion. When tight binaries are\nformed in the GC, they could destroy it during time less than the cosmological one, so the\nLMXB and single RP in the bulge could be formed in such a way.\n\nThe situation is quite different, when one of the degenerate members in the close binary\nfills its Roche Lobe. Let isolated binary contain a neutron star with a mass $M_1$,\nand a degenerate dwarf with a mass $M_d$. When the dwarf fills its Roche lobe, the radius\nof the dwarf $R_d$ is connected with a distance between stellar mass centers\n$R_{12}$ by a relation\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 18312, "prevtext": "\nThis is how the polar cap widens with the weakening magnetic field until\n$\\theta_{\\rm P}$ becomes equal to $90^o$ when (\\ref{ch3}) obviously ceases to hold.\nOn taking $M = 10^{33}$ gm, $\\dot M = 10^{-8} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,\n$r_{\\rm s} = 10$ km, $B_{\\rm s} = 10^{12}$ G, we find from (\\ref{ch2}) that\n$r_{\\rm A} \\approx 300$ km.

According to \\cite{bisf69},\nultrarelativistic electrons with a temperature $\\sim 10^{11}K$,\nmay be formed in the non-collisional shock during accretion,\nemitting a relativistic dipole line.\nThe mean energy of this line is broadened and shifted\nrelativistically, in comparison with the cyclotron line,\nby a factor of $\\gamma \\simeq \\frac{kT}{mc^2}$.\nThe spectrum profile of the relativistic dipole line is calculated\nin\\cite{babk} for\nvarious electron distributions, where the model of the hot spot\n of Her X-1 is considered, and it is shown that the overall observed\nX-ray spectrum (from 0.2 to 120 KeV) can arise under the fields near\n$5\\cdot 10^{10}$~Gs which are well below $B_{cycl}$, and are not\nin the conflict with other observations.\n\nAccording to \\cite{gs73,bis73},\nin the magnetic field near the pulsar the cross\ncomponent of a momentum of electrons is emitting rapidly,\nwhile the parallel velocity remains constant.\nHence the momentum distribution of the electrons is anisotropic\n $p_\\perp^2\\ll p_\\parallel^2$, with\n$p_\\perp\\ll mc$, $p_\\parallel\\gg mc$.\nAssume for simplicity that the transverse electron\ndistribution is two-dimensional Maxwellian\n$\n  dn=\\frac{N}{T_1}{\\exp \\left( -\\frac{m u^{2}}{2T_1} \\right)}\\,\n  d\\frac{m u^{2}}{2}\n$, $T_1 \\ll mc^2$.\n\nIn the relativistic dipole regime of\nradiation the electron is non-relativistic in\nthe coordinate system, connected with the Larmor circle. In the\nlaboratory system, where the electron is moving with a velocity $V$,\nthe angle between the magnetic field and electron momentum\nvectors is smaller than the angle of the emitting beam.

This conclusion is based on the $180\\deg$ phase shift\nbetween the X-ray beams in high and low states \\cite{ska92,det98,sco20}.\nIn order to observe the X-ray flux reflected from\nthe inner edge, situated near the Alfven radius of the accretion disc,\nit cannot be very far away from the neutron star.

According to \\cite{bisf69},\nultrarelativistic electrons with a temperature $\\sim 10^{11}K$,\nmay be formed in the non-collisional shock during accretion,\nemitting a relativistic dipole line.\nThe mean energy of this line is broadened and shifted\nrelativistically, in comparison with the cyclotron line,\nby a factor of $\\gamma \\simeq \\frac{kT}{mc^2}$.\nThe spectrum profile of the relativistic dipole line is calculated\nin\\cite{babk} for\nvarious electron distributions, where the model of the hot spot\n of Her X-1 is considered, and it is shown that the overall observed\nX-ray spectrum (from 0.2 to 120 KeV) can arise under the fields near\n$5\\cdot 10^{10}$~Gs which are well below $B_{cycl}$, and are not\nin the conflict with other observations.\n\nAccording to \\cite{gs73,bis73},\nin the magnetic field near the pulsar the cross\ncomponent of a momentum of electrons is emitting rapidly,\nwhile the parallel velocity remains constant.\nHence the momentum distribution of the electrons is anisotropic\n $p_\\perp^2\\ll p_\\parallel^2$, with\n$p_\\perp\\ll mc$, $p_\\parallel\\gg mc$.\nAssume for simplicity that the transverse electron\ndistribution is two-dimensional Maxwellian\n$\n  dn=\\frac{N}{T_1}{\\exp \\left( -\\frac{m u^{2}}{2T_1} \\right)}\\,\n  d\\frac{m u^{2}}{2}\n$, $T_1 \\ll mc^2$.\n\nIn the relativistic dipole regime of\nradiation the electron is non-relativistic in\nthe coordinate system, connected with the Larmor circle.

These changes might be easily explained in our model.\nThe velocity of the accretion flow decreases with increasing of the\npulsar\nluminosity because locally the luminosity is close to the Eddington limit.\nAs a result the shock wave intensity drops as well as the energy of the\nultrarelativistic electrons in it`s front, leading to\ndecrease of the relativistic dipole line energy.\n\n\\section{Cyclotron harmonics in the X-ray pulsars}\n\nReports about discoveries of several cyclotron harmonics in spectra\nof several X-ray pulsars appeared according to observations from RXTE and BeppoSAX:\n  X0115+63 \\cite{a}; Vela X-1 \\cite{c,c1}; 4U1907+09\n\\cite{c2,c3}; A0535+26 \\cite{d}\nThere are at least 3 harmonics observed in the spectrum of\n X0115+63 \\cite{d1,b}.\nThis is the most reliable source with the cyclotron harmonics.\nOther sources are less reliable, the second harmonic there is very weak.\nThese observations are very important and could help in solving\nsome problems of the theory of spectra formation in the X-ray pulsars.\nThere is still an open question, are the cyclotron features in the spectra\nof X-ray pulsars of absorption or emission origin.\nIn the paper \\cite{ba} all lines in 4 above mentioned sources are\ninterpreted as emission features.\n\nIt is not clear what kind of momentum distribution have electrons\nradiating the cyclotron lines.\nIt is needed, that the motion of electrons\nacross the magnetic field would be subrelativistic (or nonrelativistic),\nbecause otherwise many harmonics would merge, forming continuum synchrotron\nspectrum. I most cases only one first harmonic is visible.\nIt is accepted usually that the speed of electrons along the magnetic field\nis considerably less than the light speed $c$. However, it is possible,\nlike in the case of Her X-1, that the momentum distribution of the electrons is\nhighly anisotropic, so that their speed is subrelativistic across the magnetic field,\nand ultrarelativistic along it.\nAnalysis of different observational data of the X ray pulsar Her X-1\nhad shown that all data can be explained without contradictions under\nseggestion that the electrons forming the cyclotron feature are ultrarelativistic\nwith very anisotropic momentum distribution.\n\nWhen the perpendicular electron energy is high enough for emission of several\ncyclotron harmonics, the resulting spectrum of magneto-dipole radiation,\nproduced by electrons with nonrelativistic perpendicular and ultrarelativistic\nparallel momentum distribution, has a very specific form \\cite{ba}.

These changes might be easily explained in our model.\nThe velocity of the accretion flow decreases with increasing of the\npulsar\nluminosity because locally the luminosity is close to the Eddington limit.\nAs a result the shock wave intensity drops as well as the energy of the\nultrarelativistic electrons in it`s front, leading to\ndecrease of the relativistic dipole line energy.\n\n\\section{Cyclotron harmonics in the X-ray pulsars}\n\nReports about discoveries of several cyclotron harmonics in spectra\nof several X-ray pulsars appeared according to observations from RXTE and BeppoSAX:\n  X0115+63 \\cite{a}; Vela X-1 \\cite{c,c1}; 4U1907+09\n\\cite{c2,c3}; A0535+26 \\cite{d}\nThere are at least 3 harmonics observed in the spectrum of\n X0115+63 \\cite{d1,b}.\nThis is the most reliable source with the cyclotron harmonics.\nOther sources are less reliable, the second harmonic there is very weak.\nThese observations are very important and could help in solving\nsome problems of the theory of spectra formation in the X-ray pulsars.\nThere is still an open question, are the cyclotron features in the spectra\nof X-ray pulsars of absorption or emission origin.\nIn the paper \\cite{ba} all lines in 4 above mentioned sources are\ninterpreted as emission features.\n\nIt is not clear what kind of momentum distribution have electrons\nradiating the cyclotron lines.\nIt is needed, that the motion of electrons\nacross the magnetic field would be subrelativistic (or nonrelativistic),\nbecause otherwise many harmonics would merge, forming continuum synchrotron\nspectrum. I most cases only one first harmonic is visible.\nIt is accepted usually that the speed of electrons along the magnetic field\nis considerably less than the light speed $c$. However, it is possible,\nlike in the case of Her X-1, that the momentum distribution of the electrons is\nhighly anisotropic, so that their speed is subrelativistic across the magnetic field,\nand ultrarelativistic along it.\nAnalysis of different observational data of the X ray pulsar Her X-1\nhad shown that all data can be explained without contradictions under\nseggestion that the electrons forming the cyclotron feature are ultrarelativistic\nwith very anisotropic momentum distribution.\n\nWhen the perpendicular electron energy is high enough for emission of several\ncyclotron harmonics, the resulting spectrum of magneto-dipole radiation,\nproduced by electrons with nonrelativistic perpendicular and ultrarelativistic\nparallel momentum distribution, has a very specific form \\cite{ba}.

Besides observations of short, soft, faint\nrecurrent bursts, three of them had given giant bursts, most powerful among\nall GRB. All four SGR are situated close or inside SNR, three of them show\nlong periodic pulsations. These properties had separated SGR, situated in our\nor nearby galaxies, in a quite special class, very different from other\nGRB, which are believed to have a cosmological origin at red shifts $z \\sim 1$.\nOne SGR 1627-41 had been discovered by BATSE \\cite{vkp99a} and\nthree other had been discovered in KONUS experiment in\n1979 \\cite{mg79,mg81,gil84}. Three of SGR show regular pulsations,\nand for two of them $\\dot P$ had been estimated, indicating to very\nhigh values of the magnetic fields, up to $10^{15}$ Gs, and small age of\nthese objects. SGR have the following properties \\cite{ffc99},\n\\cite{hur99a}-\\cite{hur99e},\n\\cite{kou98,kou99,mg79},\\cite{ma99a}-\\cite{mc99c},\\cite{mcs99,wkp99b}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\quad 1. SGR0526-66 \\cite{mg79,mc99c}.\n\n\\medskip\n\nIt was discovered due to a giant burst of 5 March 1979, projected to the\nedge of the SNR N49 in LMC. Accepting the distance 55 kpc to LMC, the peak\nluminosity in the region $E_{\\gamma}>30$ keV is equal to\n$L_p=3.6\\times 10^{45}$ ergs/s, the total energy\nrelease in the peak $Q_p=1.6 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs, in the subsequent tail\n$Q_t=3.6 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs. The short recurrent bursts have\npeak luminosities in this region\n$L_p^{rec}=3\\times 10^{41}\\,-\\, 3 \\times 10^{42}$ ergs/s,\nand energy release $Q^{rec}=5\\times 10^{40}\\,-\\, 7 \\times 10^{42}$ ergs.\nThe tail was observed about 3 minutes and had regular pulsations with the\nperiod $P\\approx 8$ s. There was not a chance to measure $\\dot P$ in this\nobject.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\quad 2. SGR1900+14 \\cite{ma99a,mc99c,kou99,wkp99b}.\n\n\\medskip\n\nIt was discovered first due to its recurrent bursts, the giant burst\nwas observed 27 August, 1998. The source lies close to the less than\n$10^4$ year old SNR G42.8+0.6, situated at distance $\\sim 10$ kpc.\nPulsations had been observed in the giant burst, as well as in the\nX-ray emission observed in this source in quiescence by RXTE and\nASCA. $\\dot P$ was measured, being strongly variable. Accepting the\ndistance 10 kpc, this source had in the region $E_{\\gamma}>15$ keV:\n$L_p > 3.7\\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s, $Q_p > 6.8\\times 10^{43}$ ergs,\n$Q_t=5.2 \\times 10^{43}$ ergs, $L_p^{rec}=2\\times 10^{40}\\,-\\,\n4\\times 10^{41}$ ergs/s, $Q^{rec}=2\\times 10^{39}\\,-\\, 6\\times\n10^{41}$ ergs, $P=5.16$ s, $\\dot P=5 \\times 10^{-11}\\,-\\, 1.5\\times\n10^{-10}$ s/s. This source was discovered at frequency 111 MHz as a\nfaint, $L_r^{max}=50$ mJy, radiopulsar \\cite{shi99} with the same\n$P$ and variable $\\dot P$ good corresponding to X-ray and gamma-ray\nobservations. These values of $P$ and average $\\dot P$ correspond to\nthe rate of a loss of rotational energy $\\dot E_{rot}=3.5 \\times\n10^{34}$ ergs/s, and magnetic field $B=8 \\times 10^{14}$ Gs. The age\nof the pulsar estimated as $\\tau_p=P/2\\dot P=700$ years is much less\nthan the estimated age of the close nearby SNR. Note that the X-ray\nluminosity of this object $L_x=2\\times 10^{35}\\,\\, - \\,\\, 2\\times\n10^{36}$ ergs/s is much higher, than rate of a loss of rotational\nenergy, what means that rotation cannot be a source of energy in\nthese objects. It was suggested that the main source of energy comes\nfrom a magnetic field annihilation, and such objects had been called\nas magnetars \\cite{dt92}.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\quad 3. SGR1806-20 \\cite{kou98,hur99e}.\n\n\\medskip\n\nThis source was observed only by recurrent bursts. Connection with\nthe Galactic radio SNR G10.0-03 was found. The source has a small but\nsignificant displacement from that of the non-thermal core of this SNR.\nThe distance to SNR is estimated as 14.5 kpc. The X-ray source observed\nby ASCA and RXTE in this object shows regular pulsations with a period\n$P=7.47$ s, and average $\\dot P=8.3\\times 10^{-11}$ s/s. As in the previous\ncase, it leads to the pulsar age $\\tau_p \\sim 1500$ years, much smaller\nthat the age of SNR, estimated by $10^4$ years. These values of $P$ and $\\dot\nP$ correspond to $B=8\\times 10^{14}$ Gs. $\\dot P$ is not constant, uniform set\nof observations by RXTE gave much smaller and less definite value\n$\\dot P=2.8(1.4)\\times 10^{-11}$ s/s, the value in brackets gives 1$\\sigma$\nerror. The peak luminosity in the burst reaches\n$L_p^{rec}\\sim 10^{41}$ ergs/s in\nthe region 25-60 keV, the X-ray luminosity in 2-10 keV band is\n$L_x\\approx 2\\times 10^{35}$ ergs/s is also much higher than the rate\nof the loss of rotational energy (for average $\\dot P$) $\\dot E_{rot}\n\\approx 10^{33}$ ergs/s.\n\n\\medskip\n\n\\quad 4. SRG1627-41 \\cite{ma99a,vkp99a}.\n\n\\medskip\n\nHere the giant burst was observed 18 June 1998, in addition to numerous\nsoft recurrent bursts. Its position coincides with the SNR G337.0-0.1,\nassuming 5.8 kpc distance. Some\nevidences was obtained for a possible periodicity of 6.7 s, but giant burst\ndoes not show any periodic signal \\cite{ma99a}, contrary to\ntwo other giant burst in SGR. The following characteristics\nhad been observed with a time resolution 2 ms at photon energy\n$E_{\\gamma}> 15$ keV:\n $L_p \\sim 8\\times 10^{43}$ ergs/s,\n$Q_p \\sim 3\\times 10^{42}$ ergs,\nno tail of the giant burst had been observed.\n$L_p^{rec}=4\\times 10^{40}\\,-\\, 4\\times 10^{41}$ ergs/s,\n$Q^{rec}=10^{39}\\,-\\, 3\\times 10^{40}$ ergs. Periodicity in this source is\nnot certain, so there is no $\\dot P$.\n\nTo measure $\\dot P$ the peaks of the beam are compared during long\nperiod of time. Both SRG with measured $\\dot P$ have highly variable beam\nshapes, what implies systematic errors in the result. Another source of\nsystematic error comes from the barycenter correction of the arriving\nsignal in\nthe source with an essential error in  angular coordinates. This effect is\nespecially significant for determination of $\\ddot P$ \\cite{biskp93},\nbut when observational shifts are short the error in the\ncoordinates could not be extracted easily. Earth motion around the Sun, as\nwell as the satellite motion around the Earth may influence the results.\nNevertheless, independent measurements of $P$ and $\\dot P$ in such\ndifferent spectral bands as radio and X-rays gave similar results for\nSGR1900+14.\n\nThe physical connection between SGR and related SNR is not perfectly\nestablished: SNR ages are much larger, than ages of SNR estimated\nby $P$ and $\\dot P$ measurements, and all four SGR are situated at the\nvery edge of the corresponding SNR, or well outside them. Using the pulsar\nage estimation we come to conclusion of a very high speed of the neutron star\nat several thousands km/s, exceeding strongly all measured speeds of\nradiopulsars.\nPhysical properties of the pulsars observed in SGR are very unusual.\nIf the connection with SNR is real, and the distances to SGR are the same\nthen the pulsar luminosity\nduring giant bursts is much larger than the\ncritical Eddington luminosity. As follows from simple physical reasons,\nwhen the radiation force is much larger than the force of gravity, the matter\nwould be expelled at large speed, forming strong outflow and dense envelope\naround the neutron star which could screen pulsations. No\noutflowing envelope around SGR have been found.\nThe  large difference between $\\dot E_{rot}$ and average $L_x+L_{\\gamma}$\nluminosity needs to suggest a source of energy, much larger than the one\ncoming from the rotational losses. It is suggested that in \"magnetars\" the\nenergy comes from the magnetic field annihilation\n\\cite{dt92}. It is rather surprising to observe the\nfield annihilation without formation of relativistic\nparticles, where considerable part of the released energy should go.\nRadio emitting nebula should be formed around the SGR, but\nhad not been found.  So, it is not possible to exclude that there is no\nphysical connection between SNR and SGR, that SGR are much closer objects,\ntheir pulsar luminosity is less than the Eddington one, and their\nmagnetic fields are not so extremely high.\n\nThere is a striking similarity between SGR and special class of\nX-ray pulsars called anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXP). Both have periods\nin the interval 6 - 12 seconds, binarity was not found, spin-down of the\npulsar corresponding to small age $\\sim 1000$ years, observed irregularities\nin $\\dot P$ (see e.g. \\cite{mel99}). The main difference is an absence of\nany visible bursts in AXP, characteristic for SGR. Suggestions had been\nmade about their common\norigin as \"magnetars\" \\cite{kou98,mel99}. Other\nmodels of AXP had been discussed (see e.g. \\cite{mis98}). We\nmay expect that establishing of the nature of AXP would help strongly\nfor the determination of the nature of SGR.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nInterpretation of SGR as \"magnetars\", and the hypothesis about\nthe magnetic field annihilation as the main source of energy arises\nquestions, when we compare this model with the well established\nastronomical data. The giant explosions in GRB produce huge amount of\nenergy, $> 10^{44}$ ergs in gamma region, and comparable amount in\nrelativistic particles, generated during the field annihilation. 6 orders\nof magnitude lower energy output in the form of relativistic particles,\nproduced during starquakes in the Crab pulsar make a visible changes\nin the morphology of the Crab nebula \\cite{sca}.\nThere are no data indicating the changes in the SNR structure after any giant\nburst of GRB, while it should be possible to observe the results of such a\nproduction of such a huge amount of energy in a short time. Magnetic field\nannihilation is accompanied by a particle acceleration, so SGR should become\na bright radio source, at least after the giant burst. Nevertheless, SGRs are very\nfaint radio sources, and do not show increase of radio emission during  giant bursts.\n\nComparison of giant bursts in SGR and short GRB (duration less than 2 seconds)\nshows a big resemblance of both\nevents. They have similar length, structure and spectra, which are harder than spectra\nof long GRB (\\cite{cmo99}).\nIf SGR would be about 10 times more distant objects we could see only their giant\nbursts, which undoubtfully would be interpreted as short GRB.\nThe galaxies of our local group, containing SGR would be observed as sources of short\nGRB. Having in mind, that Andromeda galaxy is about 3 times heavier than the Galaxy\n\\cite{allen}, we should expect about 10 SGR which could produce\na comparable number of giant bursts\nduring the observational time ( $\\sim 30$ years), visible as short GRB\n\\cite{bis00,bis01,bis02}.\nAnalysis of BATSE and KONUS catalogs does not give any evidence about GRBs\ncoinciding  with any Local Group galaxy, including Andromeda \\cite{mg81,cat4}\nBetter statistical estimation and search in BATSE/KONUS data are desirable for\ninvestigation of connection between short GRB and SGR.\n\nThe present interpretation of SGR suggests a neutron star with very high magnetic field,\nwhich is very short living, and should not be visible in its present view\nafter about 1000 years. During this time the neutron star will not have time to\ncool enough, so it will be visible at least as soft X-ray source\nwith a temperature $>3 \\cdot 10^5$ K during about $10^5$ years \\cite{yak01}.\nIt would be interesting to look for such remnants in the existing and future\nX-ray surveys. No candidates for such remnants are found until now.\nIn total we could expect about $10^8$ neutron stars as remnants of SGR\n\\cite{bis02}, and about 1000 of them should have surface temperatures exceeding\n$>3 \\cdot 10^5$ K.\n\nMechanism of \"magnetar\" emission in SGR suggests magnetic field annihilation as the\nmain source of the energy. We will not discuss the physics of such process, which looks\nout very strangely, because it is unclear how it is possible to annihilate the\nfield, which is produced by electrical currents deep inside the neutron star, in its\ncore, or at least in its crust. Let us consider the results of such annihilation.\nSolar flashes produced by field annihilation are\ncharacterized by very broad spectrum, from radio to gamma.\n Is remains unclear how it is possible to provide $\\gamma$-radiation by magnetic\nfield annihilation without appearance of large number of ultra-relativistic\nparticles and strong nonthermal emission in other spectral bands.\n\nThe estimation of the magnetic fields of \"magnetars\" in SGR is done using\nthe usual formula (ref{ref2}), which gives estimation of the magnetic fields in\nrotationally powered pulsars. In the situation, when $L_{tot}\\gg \\dot E_{rot}$\nthe decrease of the rotational period may be connected not only with the\ndipole-like radiation, leading to (ref{ref2}), but may be much more effective due to\nejection of relativistic particles (pulsar wind) induced by the field annihilation.\nIt will lead to much smaller values of the estimations of the SGR ages, which are\ntoo small in comparison with the corresponding SNR ages even with this\nartificial interpretation. As was indicated in \\cite{mrl99} there are no\nreasons to use (\\ref{ref2}) with the measured $P$ and $\\dot P$ for estimations\nof SGR ages.\n\nContrary to SGR and AXP the age and magnetic field estimations of radiopulsars\ndo not have such contradictions and seems quite reliable. During last few years\nseveral radiopulsars have been discovered, which have very similar periods and\nmagnetic fields, but otherwise behave like ordinary pulsars. The first discovery\nof 8.5 s pulsar J2144-3933 with a normal magnetic field $B=2.0 \\cdot 10^{12}$ Gs,\nand large characteristic age $\\tau=2.8 \\cdot 10^8$ years\nwas reported in \\cite{yom99}. The period of this pulsar is well inside the interval\n6-12 s, characteristic for AXP, but magnetic field and age are similar to the\nmajority of radiopulsars. Farther discoveries revealed existence of radiopulsars\nwith very high fields, subscribed to \"magnetars\".\nPulsars PSRs J119-6127 and J1814-1744 have been discovered \\cite{cam00}. These\npulsars with periods 0.407 s and 3.98 s, have magnetic fields\n$B=4.1 \\cdot 10^{13}$ Gs and $B=5.5 \\cdot 10^{13}$ Gs, and characteristic ages\n$\\tau=1.6 \\cdot 10^3$ years and $\\tau=8.5 \\cdot 10^4$ years respectively.\nIn these two pulsars only magnetic fields are unusually high but other\ncharacteristics are normal, with the second period on the edge of the distribution.\nIn two subsequently discovered PSRs J1847-0130 and J1718-37184\nmagnetic fields are even higher, and all characteristics\nare similar to the \"magnetars\". These\npulsars have periods 6.7 s and 3.4 s, magnetic fields\n$B=0.94 \\cdot 10^{14}$ Gs and $B=0.74 \\cdot 10^{14}$ Gs, respectively,\nand characteristic ages\n$\\tau=8.3 \\cdot 10^4$ years is measured only for the first pulsar\n\\cite{mcl03,mcla03}. We may expect farther discoveries of radiopulsars\nwith large periods and high magnetic fields, like prescribed to \"magnetars\"\nin AXP and SGR. These\ndiscoveries create additional doubts to the \"magnetar\" model of SGR and AXP.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Magnetic fields of radiopulsars are in good correspondence with\ntheoretical estimations.\n\\item  RP and LMXB have small magnetic fields, which very probably\nhad been decreased by damping or screening during accretion stage.\n\\item  Contradiction between high $B_{cycl}$ and other\nobservational estimations of $B$ in the LMXB Her X-1 may be removed in\nthe model of relativistic dipole mechanism of the formation of a hard\nspectral feature by strongly anisortopic relativistic electrons, leading to\nconventional value of $B\\approx 5\\times 10^{10}$ Gs.\n\\item  Very high magnetic fields in magnetar model of SGR needs farther\nconfirmation and investigation.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n{\\bf Acknowledgements}\n\nThis work was partially supported by RFBR grant 02-02-16900, and RAN programm\n\"Nonstationary processes in astrophysics\".\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem{aa75}  Aarseth S.J., Lecar M. 1975, {\\it Ann.
