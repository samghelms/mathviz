A key feature\nof the $R_{\\rm H}=ct$ model is that the zero active mass condition\n$\\rho+3p=0$ holds at all epochs. Most recently, Melia has claimed that\nthis condition is a requirement of the symmetries of the\nFriedmann--Robertson--Walker spacetime. We demonstrate that this claim\nis false and results from a flaw in the logic of Melia's argument.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\\begin{keywords}\ncosmology: theory -- gravitation\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $\\Lambda$CDM model serves as the basis for the current standard\nmodel of cosmology, which provides a good fit to a wide range of\ncosmological observations. As first pointed out by \\cite{Melia2003},\nhowever, for the best-fit $\\Lambda$CDM model, the present-day Hubble\ndistance $R_{\\rm H}(t_0)$ is equal to $ct_0$ within observational uncertainties,\nwhere $t_0$ is the current cosmic epoch. In other words,\nobservations suggest that the universe has expanded by an amount equal\nto what would have occurred had the expansion rate been constant or,\nequivalently, that the average acceleration of the universe up the\npresent epoch is consistent with zero; this is despite the fact that\nthe combination of time-dependent radiation, matter and dark-energy\ndensities $\\rho_{\\rm r}(t)$, $\\rho_{\\rm m}(t)$ and $\\rho_{\\rm de}(t)$\nshould have produced periods of deceleration and acceleration.\nAnother way to describe this finding \\citep{Melia2009} is that, averaged\nover a Hubble time, the quantity $p/\\rho$, where $\\rho = \\rho_{\\rm r}\n+ \\rho_{\\rm m} + \\rho_{\\rm de}$ and $p = p_{\\rm r} + p_{\\rm m} +\np_{\\rm de}$, yields $\\langle p/\\rho\\rangle = -1/3$ to within the\nobservational uncertainties.\n\nIn the $\\Lambda$CDM model, this correspondence is a peculiar\ncoincidence, made all the more striking by the fact that, for the\nbest-fit model, this situation should occur only once in the history\nof the universe. The fact that we observe this correspondence at the\npresent epoch is therefore most intriguing.\n\nConsequently, it was proposed by\n\\cite{Melia2007,Melia2009,MeliaShevchuk2012} that this correspondence\nis not coincidental, but should be satisfied at all cosmic times\n$t$. The physical argument originally presented for this viewpoint was\nbased on applying Birkhoff's theorem and its corollary to a spherical\nsubregion of a homogeneous and isotropic matter distribution, from\nwhich it was claimed that one could identify the Hubble radius $R_{\\rm\n  H}$ with the gravitational radius $R_{\\rm H}=2GM/c^2$, given in\nterms of the Misner--Sharp mass $M = (4\\pi/3)R_{\\rm H}^3(\\rho/c^2)$\n\\citep{MisnerSharp1964}.  Imposing this condition on the usual\ncosmological field equations for an FRW spacetime picks out a unique\nsolution, for which $R_{\\rm H}(t)=ct$ at all cosmic times. This is\nequivalent to vanishing total active mass, $\\rho+3p=0$, at all epochs.\n\nThe resulting cosmological model, known as the `$R_{\\rm H}=ct$' model,\nhas received considerable attention over the last few years, since it\nhas been claimed to be favoured over the standard $\\Lambda$CDM (and\nits variant $w$CDM with $w\\neq -1$) by most observational data\n\\citep{MeliaMaier2013,Wei2013,Wei2014a,Wei2014b,Wei2015,Melia_etal2015}.\nNonetheless, the validity of the physical argument underlying the\n$R_{\\rm H}=ct$ model has been criticised by a number of authors\n\\citep{vanOirschot2010,LewisvanOirschot2012,Mitra2014}, and in\nparticular the validity of the effective equation-of-state parameter\n$w=-1/3$ \\citep{Lewis2013}.  These and other criticisms are claimed to\nhave been addressed by \\cite{Bikwa2012} and \\cite{Melia2012c} (see also\n\\cite{Melia2015} and references therein), but the original physical\narguments for the model given in\n\\cite{Melia2007,Melia2009,MeliaShevchuk2012} are sufficiently\nimponderable that is difficult to draw definite conclusions.\n\nIn a recent paper \\citep{Melia2016}, however, Melia presents a much more\nexplicit argument for the zero active mass condition $\\rho+3p=0$,\nwhich he claims is a requirement of the symmetries of the FRW\nspacetime. In particular, it is claimed that assuming the general,\nspherically symmetric (but radially varying) metric, solving the\nEinstein field equations, and then imposing homogeneity and isotropy\nyields an extra condition, namely vanishing active mass, which is lost\nif one adopts the usual procedure of first imposing the conditions of\nhomogeneity and isotropy on the metric and then solving the Einstein\nequations. The purpose of our Letter is to demonstrate that this claim\nis false, owing to a flaw in the logic of Melia's argument, and hence\nthat FRW models are in fact consistent with non-zero active mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelia starts with the general spherically symmetric metric in a\ncomoving coordinate system, which we denote by\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  ds^2 = A^2dt^2 - B^2dr^2 - R^2 d\\Omega^2,\n  \\label{eqn:metric_comov}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"ds^{2}=A^{2}dt^{2}-B^{2}dr^{2}-R^{2}d\\Omega^{2},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msup><mi>B</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07890.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\nMelia then writes $A(t)$ in the following form\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6645, "prevtext": "\nwhere $A$, $B$ and $R$ are in general functions of both $r$ and $t$,\nand first considers the general case, where homogeneity is\n\\textit{not} assumed.

He correctly points out, however, that one is not\nallowed to make such a transformation, since the $t$ coordinate is\nfixed at the outset by the requirement that a free-falling observer is\ncomoving with the fluid. Of course, since the conditions $A=1$ and\n$\\rho+3p \\neq 0$ are, in fact, compatible, this does not pose any\nproblems. On a related issue, \\cite{Lasenby1998} present a novel\nmethod for solving the Einstein equations for general spherically\nsymmetric systems. The original approach was presented in the language\nof geometric algebra, but can be straightforwardly re-expressed in\nmore familiar tetrad notation \\citep{NLH3}. In this approach, one may\nshow, without any consideration of comoving or free-fall frames, that\na homogeneous system requires the tetrad component denoted by $f_1$ in\n\\cite{NLH3} to equal unity, which necessitates $g_{tt}=1$ in comoving\ncoordinates.\n\nIn conclusion, we reiterate that, contrary to the claims presented in\n\\cite{Melia2016}, there is no extra information to be extracted from\nstarting by substituting the general spherically-symmetric metric into\nthe Einstein equations and then imposing homogeneity and isotropy, as\ncompared to the usual route of first imposing homogeneity and\nisotropy on the metric and then employing the Einstein equations. Hence, the FRW\nspacetime is perfectly compatible with having $\\rho+3p \\neq 0$. It is\nalso worth pointing out here that the many claims that the $R_{\\rm\n  H}=ct$ model is favoured over $\\Lambda$CDM by observational data\nshould also be treated with caution. In the $\\Lambda$CDM model, there\nis no requirement that $\\rho+3p = 0$. This condition is, however,\nconsistent with observations, as has been known for some time.  If one\nmerely imposes this addtional condition {\\em post-hoc} on the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, to arrive at the $R_{\\rm H}=ct$ model, then any model\nselection approach will naturally favour the latter. Such analyses\nhave content only if one has a physical reason {\\em a priori} to\nimpose the zero active mass condition. As we have shown, the argument\npresented in \\cite{Melia2016} for imposing this condition is not\nvalid.\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nDo Young Kim was supported by a Samsung Scholarship.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{mnras}\n\\bibliography{ref_w_abbrev}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\bsp\t\n\\label{lastpage}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 10351, "prevtext": "\n\nThe flaw in his logic then lies in the following.
