Another way of asking this question is what is the probability of \n some number of repetitions during the 110 hours, given a repeat rate. The answer to \nthis question depends strongly on the power spectrum's shape. For the sake of example, if the average \nrepeat rate is once per two hours, then the probability of one repeat or fewer in the Poisson\ncase is effectively zero. With a pink distribution it is closer to $5\\%$, even though \nthe expected number would be 55. This is \nshown in Figure \\ref{FIG-hist}, in which we plot the probability of seeing zero or one repeat burst \n(the two options for FRB 140514), given some average repetition period, $P$. \nWe generate the pink distribution in the same way described in Section \\ref{flicker}, \nusing one-hour samples and a long-wavelength cutoff at 1.2 million hours. Though \nit was taken arbitrarily, the probability of seeing no bursts should depend only \nweakly on this cutoff. Since the variance scales logarithmically with this number, \nthere is only roughly a factor of three \ndifference in total power between our choice and $f_{\\rm{min}}\\sim$ an inverse Hubble time. \nWhile we remain agnostic about the relationship between 140514 and 110220, with \nnon-Poissonian repetition it is possible to have a relatively high repeat rate \nand to see either one or zero repeat bursts in several days of observation. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[trim={0in, 0in, 0in, 0in}, width=0.43\\textwidth, height=0.3\\textwidth]{repeat_rate_limit.png}\n   \\caption{The probability of seeing zero (blue curve) or one (red curve) repeat burst\n   in 110 hours of follow-up, assuming a 1/$f$ distribution.  \n   The curves are derived from a simple Monte Carlo in which a\n   pink distribution was generated with one sample per hour, \n   and we asked how many bursts were seen in 110 samples.

This means the daily rate \n$3.3^{+5.0}_{-2.5}\\times10^3$ sky$^{-1}$ estimated by \n\\cite{2015arXiv150500834R} would be produced by\nonly $\\sim$160-1600 sources. In this scenario \nthere is no FRB in most pixels on the sky, which means\none could integrate on most patches forever without \nseeing an event. An example of this strategy is the VLA millisecond search, \nin which $\\sim40\\%$ of the time was spent at a single pointing, and\nalmost three quarters of the time was spent at just three locations \\citep{2015ApJ...807...16L}.\nIt is possible that pointing-to-pointing event rate variance contributed \nto their not seeing anything.\n\nWe therefore warn that deep surveys are at a disadvantage \nto those that sweep large regions of the sky \n(CHIME  \\citep{2014SPIE.9145E..22B}, \nUTMOST\\footnote{http://www.caastro.org/news/2014-utmost}, HIRAX)\nbecause the non-repeating \nscenario is unaffected; whereas shallow observations \nshould not hurt the detection rate, no matter what their repetition. \nIdeally, a survey\nneeds only to spend a few dispersion delay times on each beam \nbefore moving on. \n\n\\section{Latitudinal dependence}\n\\label{latitude}\n\nThere is now evidence that the FRB rate is nonuniform on the sky, \nwith fewer detectable events at low Galactic latitudes \\citep{2014ira..book.....B}.\nHowever the statistical significance of this finding may be \noverestimated. \\cite{2014ApJ...789L..26P}\ncompute the probability of the disparity between the number of \nbursts seen in the high- and intermediate-latitude ($|b| < 15\\degree$)\ncomponents of the High Time Resolution Universe survey \n(HTRU). They calculate the probability of seeing $N=0$ in the intermediate \nlatitude survey and $M=4$ in \nthe high-latitude, despite having searched 88$\\%$ more data in the former, and they \nrule out the uniform sky hypothesis with 99.5$\\%$ certainty. We would point out \nthat in general $P(N|M)$ describes a very specific outcome, and it would be \nmore appropriate to include all outcomes equally or more unlikely.\nThat number might also be multiplied by two, since if the survey found \nfour intermediate-latitude FRBs and zero high-lat ones, we would ask the same \nquestion. \n\nBut a simpler approach to this problem would be analogous to a series of \ncoin flips. If a coin were flipped four times, the probability of seeing all heads is 1/16, \nor 6.25$\\%$. This is a factor of six higher than  the analogous analysis of \n\\citet{2014ApJ...789L..26P}.  We can test the null hypothesis that the coin is fair, and using\nthe binomial statistic would conclude that the outcome is consistent with a \nfair coin at 95\\% confidence, differing from the conclusion of \\citet{2014ApJ...789L..26P}.\nIn the FRB case the Universe is flipping a coin each time a new burst \nappears, with some bias factor due to things like different integration times.\nHTRU \nhas since reported five more bursts in the high Galactic region, but using a dataset \nthat spent $\\sim$2.5 times more time at high latitudes. Below we try and quantify the likelihood of \nthis.\n\n\nIf one wants to \ncompare two statistical hypotheses, then the claims of each should \nbe treated as true and their likelihood discrepancy should be computed.\nIn the case of testing the abundance of FRBs at high latitudes,\nthe sky should be partitioned into high and low regions a priori \n(e.g., the predefined high-latitude HTRU and its complement). The rate in both regions \nis then taken to be the same, and the likelihood of a given spatial distribution of observed\nsources can be calculated. This situation is naturally\ndescribed by a biased binomial distribution with a fixed number of events. Suppose\na total of $K$ FRBs are observed in a given survey. We can ask the question, what is the probability of \nseeing $M$ events in the high region and ($K-M$) events in the lower region?\nThis probability can be calculated \nas \n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 6130, "prevtext": "\n\\date{\\today}\n\\pagerange{\\pageref{firstpage}--\\pageref{lastpage}} \n\\pubyear{2015}\n\\maketitle\n\\label{firstpage}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nWe discuss some of the claims that have been made regarding the statistics of \nfast radio bursts (FRBs). In an earlier paper \\citep{2015arXiv150505535C} \nwe conjectured that flicker noise associated \nwith FRB repetition could show up in non-cataclysmic neutron star emission models,\nlike supergiant pulses. We show how the current limits of repetition \nwould be significantly weakened if their repeat rate really were non-Poissonian\nand had a pink or red spectrum.\nRepetition and its statistics have implications for observing strategy, generally favouring \nshallow wide-field surveys, since in the non-repeating scenario survey depth is unimportant. \nWe also discuss the statistics of the apparent latitudinal dependence of FRBs, and offer\na simple method for calculating the significance of this effect.  We provide a generalized Bayesian framework for addressing \nthis problem, which allows for direct model comparison. \nIt is shown how \nthe evidence for a steep latitudinal gradient of the FRB rate is less strong than initially suggested \nand simple explanations like increased scattering and sky temperature \nin the plane are sufficient to decrease the low-latitude burst rate, given current data.\nThe reported dearth of bursts near the plane is further complicated if FRBs have \nnon-Poissonian repetition, since in that case the event rate inferred from observation\ndepends on observing strategy.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\begin{keywords}\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThere is mounting evidence that the new class of transients \nknown as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are of extraterrestrial origin.\nThe most striking features of FRBs are their large dispersion\nmeasures (DMs) -- too high to be attributed to our own Galaxy's\ninterstellar medium (ISM) --\nand their event rate (10$^3$-$10^4$ sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$). They\nlast for about a millisecond with peak flux of roughly a Jy, and none\nhas been conclusively shown to repeat. This has led to the \ninterpretation that FRBs are cosmological,\nsince the intergalactic medium (IGM) would naturally provide\nDMs between 300-1600 pc cm$^{-3}$ for sources at \n$z\\sim0.3$-$1$ \\citep{2013Sci...341...53T}. \n\nGiven their apparent phenomenological richness\n(polarization, scattering, etc.) and considering\nhow little we know about their location and physical \norigin, it is likely that FRBs will be of interest to the community for \nyears to come, assuming they are not terrestrial.\nThough we are in the regime of only a dozen published FRBs, \nat present the conventional wisdom is that they are likely cosmological\nin origin \\citep{2013Sci...341...53T}, they seem to not repeat regularly\n\\citep{2015MNRAS.454..457P}, and there is a dearth of bursts \nat low Galactic latitudes \\citep{2014ApJ...789L..26P, 2014ApJ...792...19B, 2015MNRAS.451.3278M}.\n\nBased on this premise there have been \na number of models proposed to describe cataclysmic, cosmological \nFRBs \\citep{2012ApJ...760...64M, 2013PASJ...65L..12T, 2014A&A...562A.137F, 2015ApJ...814L..20M}.\nHowever since the field is still in its infancy it is important to\nleave as many conceptual doors open as possible;\nassumptions about the statistics of the event rate, \nspatial distribution, and repetition are important for the design\nand observing strategy of upcoming surveys. In Section \\ref{repeat} we explore the \nconsequences of repeating FRBs in the case where their \nburst rate is non-Possionian and exhibits a 1/$f$ power spectrum, \nor pink noise. We also investigate the claims of \\cite{2015arXiv150701002M}\nthat FRB 140514 could have been the same source as FRB 110220, \nand comment on its implications. In Section \\ref{rate} we\ndiscuss the impact of FRB repetition on survey strategy. In Section \\ref{latitude}\nwe discuss the statistical treatment of the apparent latitudinal dependence \nof the event rate and the lack of detections at low Galactic latitude.\n\n\n\n\\section{Repeat rates}\n\\label{repeat}\n\nThough no source has been shown with certainty to repeat, \nthe limits on repeatability of FRBs are still weak. Several \nmodels generically predict repetition, whether periodic or stochastic. \nGalactic flaring stars \\citep{2015arXiv150701002M}, radio-bursting \nmagnetars \\citep{2007arXiv0710.2006P, 2015ApJ...807..179P}, and pulsar planet systems \n\\citep{2014A&A...569A..86M} all predict repetition with varying \nrates and burst distributions. \n\nIn \\cite{2015arXiv150505535C} it was \nsuggested that supergiant pulses from very young pulsars in supernova \nremnants of nearby galaxies could explain the high DMs, Faraday rotation, \nscintillation, and polarization properties of the observed FRBs. We  \nproposed that if the repetition of supergiant pulses were non-Poissonian \n(with a pink or red distribution) \nthen one might expect several bursts in a short period of time. \nIt is also worth mentioning that the statistics and repeat rates of FRBs \ncould vary from source to source -- even if \nthey come from a single class of progenitors -- so a long follow-up on an individual burst \nmay not provide global constraints.\nIn this \nletter we will refer to stationary Poisson processes (expectation value, $\\mu(t)$, is constant in time)\nas ``Poissonian\". When we discuss non-Poissonian statistics we will be\nfocusing on stochastic processes that are correlated on varying timescales. For\nexample we will not discuss periodic signals, which are not Poissonian but \nhave already been studied \\citep{2015MNRAS.454..457P}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Flicker noise}\n\\label{flicker}\n\nPink noise is ubiquitous in physical systems, showing up in \ngeology and meteorology, a number \nof astrophysical sources including quasars and the sun, \nhuman biology, nearly all electronic devices, finance, \nand even music and speech\n\\citep{1978ComAp...7..103P, 1975Natur.258..317V}.\nThough there is no agreed-upon\nmathematical explanation for this phenomenon\n \\citep{2002physics...4033M}, fluctuations \nare empirically known to be inversely proportional to frequency \nfor a variety of dynamical systems.

Another way of asking this question is what is the probability of \n some number of repetitions during the 110 hours, given a repeat rate. The answer to \nthis question depends strongly on the power spectrum's shape. For the sake of example, if the average \nrepeat rate is once per two hours, then the probability of one repeat or fewer in the Poisson\ncase is effectively zero. With a pink distribution it is closer to $5\\%$, even though \nthe expected number would be 55. This is \nshown in Figure \\ref{FIG-hist}, in which we plot the probability of seeing zero or one repeat burst \n(the two options for FRB 140514), given some average repetition period, $P$. \nWe generate the pink distribution in the same way described in Section \\ref{flicker}, \nusing one-hour samples and a long-wavelength cutoff at 1.2 million hours. Though \nit was taken arbitrarily, the probability of seeing no bursts should depend only \nweakly on this cutoff. Since the variance scales logarithmically with this number, \nthere is only roughly a factor of three \ndifference in total power between our choice and $f_{\\rm{min}}\\sim$ an inverse Hubble time. \nWhile we remain agnostic about the relationship between 140514 and 110220, with \nnon-Poissonian repetition it is possible to have a relatively high repeat rate \nand to see either one or zero repeat bursts in several days of observation. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[trim={0in, 0in, 0in, 0in}, width=0.43\\textwidth, height=0.3\\textwidth]{repeat_rate_limit.png}\n   \\caption{The probability of seeing zero (blue curve) or one (red curve) repeat burst\n   in 110 hours of follow-up, assuming a 1/$f$ distribution.  \n   The curves are derived from a simple Monte Carlo in which a\n   pink distribution was generated with one sample per hour, \n   and we asked how many bursts were seen in 110 samples. Thousands of 110-hour realizations\n   were then averaged for each repeat period, $P$. \n   Even with an average \n   repeat rate of once every two hours, there is still a 5$\\%$ chance (indicated by the dashed line) of seeing one or\n   fewer bursts, despite the expected value of 55.}\n   \\label{FIG-hist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Event rates and total number of sources}\n\\label{rate}\n\nIf FRBs were found to repeat, their statistics and the\naverage frequency of their repetition \nshould affect the search strategy of upcoming surveys. \nFor instance, if it were found that FRBs repeated,\non average, five times a day, then the number of unique \nsources would be five times smaller than the per-sky \ndaily event rate. This means the daily rate \n$3.3^{+5.0}_{-2.5}\\times10^3$ sky$^{-1}$ estimated by \n\\cite{2015arXiv150500834R} would be produced by\nonly $\\sim$160-1600 sources. In this scenario \nthere is no FRB in most pixels on the sky, which means\none could integrate on most patches forever without \nseeing an event. An example of this strategy is the VLA millisecond search, \nin which $\\sim40\\%$ of the time was spent at a single pointing, and\nalmost three quarters of the time was spent at just three locations \\citep{2015ApJ...807...16L}.\nIt is possible that pointing-to-pointing event rate variance contributed \nto their not seeing anything.\n\nWe therefore warn that deep surveys are at a disadvantage \nto those that sweep large regions of the sky \n(CHIME  \\citep{2014SPIE.9145E..22B}, \nUTMOST\\footnote{http://www.caastro.org/news/2014-utmost}, HIRAX)\nbecause the non-repeating \nscenario is unaffected; whereas shallow observations \nshould not hurt the detection rate, no matter what their repetition. \nIdeally, a survey\nneeds only to spend a few dispersion delay times on each beam \nbefore moving on. \n\n\\section{Latitudinal dependence}\n\\label{latitude}\n\nThere is now evidence that the FRB rate is nonuniform on the sky, \nwith fewer detectable events at low Galactic latitudes \\citep{2014ira..book.....B}.\nHowever the statistical significance of this finding may be \noverestimated. \\cite{2014ApJ...789L..26P}\ncompute the probability of the disparity between the number of \nbursts seen in the high- and intermediate-latitude ($|b| < 15\\degree$)\ncomponents of the High Time Resolution Universe survey \n(HTRU). They calculate the probability of seeing $N=0$ in the intermediate \nlatitude survey and $M=4$ in \nthe high-latitude, despite having searched 88$\\%$ more data in the former, and they \nrule out the uniform sky hypothesis with 99.5$\\%$ certainty. We would point out \nthat in general $P(N|M)$ describes a very specific outcome, and it would be \nmore appropriate to include all outcomes equally or more unlikely.\nThat number might also be multiplied by two, since if the survey found \nfour intermediate-latitude FRBs and zero high-lat ones, we would ask the same \nquestion. \n\nBut a simpler approach to this problem would be analogous to a series of \ncoin flips. If a coin were flipped four times, the probability of seeing all heads is 1/16, \nor 6.25$\\%$. This is a factor of six higher than  the analogous analysis of \n\\citet{2014ApJ...789L..26P}.  We can test the null hypothesis that the coin is fair, and using\nthe binomial statistic would conclude that the outcome is consistent with a \nfair coin at 95\\% confidence, differing from the conclusion of \\citet{2014ApJ...789L..26P}.\nIn the FRB case the Universe is flipping a coin each time a new burst \nappears, with some bias factor due to things like different integration times.\nHTRU \nhas since reported five more bursts in the high Galactic region, but using a dataset \nthat spent $\\sim$2.5 times more time at high latitudes. Below we try and quantify the likelihood of \nthis.\n\n\nIf one wants to \ncompare two statistical hypotheses, then the claims of each should \nbe treated as true and their likelihood discrepancy should be computed.\nIn the case of testing the abundance of FRBs at high latitudes,\nthe sky should be partitioned into high and low regions a priori \n(e.g., the predefined high-latitude HTRU and its complement). The rate in both regions \nis then taken to be the same, and the likelihood of a given spatial distribution of observed\nsources can be calculated. This situation is naturally\ndescribed by a biased binomial distribution with a fixed number of events. Suppose\na total of $K$ FRBs are observed in a given survey.

In \nthe case of repetition, we remind the reader that several non-cataclysmic \nmodels for FRBs are expected to repeat. In the case of supergiant \npulses from pulsars, SGR radio flares, or even Galactic flare stars, it is possible \nthat this repetition would be non-stationary and might exhibit strong correlations \nin time. We have shown that if the repetition had some associated flicker noise \nand its power spectrum were 1/$f^\\gamma$, then one should expect the repetition \nrate to be higher immediately after the initial FRB detection. Therefore follow-up \nobservations to archival discoveries that take place years or \nmonths after the first event would not provide strong upper limits. \nThis would also mean that if no burst is found in a given beam after some \nintegration time, then it is unlikely that one will occur in the following integration, and therefore \na new pointing should be searched. In other words, shallow fast surveys would be favourable. \n\nIn Section \\ref{latitude} we offered a simple way of quantifying the \nlatitudinal dependence of FRBs with a binomial distribution. This \nis akin to a biased coin flip, in which we ask ``what is the probability of \n$M$ bursts being found in one region and $N$ bursts in its complement, given \n$\\alpha$ times more time was spent in the former\". Like \\cite{2015arXiv150500834R} we argue\nthat the jury is still out on the severity of the latitudinal \ndependence.
