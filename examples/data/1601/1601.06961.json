The case of the partial wetting is considered. The drops are in an atmosphere of\nnitrogen saturated with water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and coalesce. A\nnew convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially and slowly relaxes to an equilibrium\nhemispherical cap. The characteristic relaxation time is proportional to the drop radius $R^\\ast $ at final\nequilibrium. This relaxation time appears to be nearly 10$^{7}$ times larger than the bulk capillary\nrelaxation time $t_{b}=R^{\\ast }\\eta /\\sigma $, where $\\sigma $ is the gas-liquid surface tension and $\\eta $\nis the liquid shear viscosity.\n\nIn order to explain this ``giant'' relaxation time, we consider a model that involves an Arrhenius kinetic\nfactor resulting from a liquid-vapor phase change in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a\nlarge relaxation time of the order $t_{b}\\exp(L/{\\cal R}T)$ where $L$ is the molar latent heat of\nvaporization, $\\cal R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the temperature. We model the late time relaxation for\na near spherical cap and finds an exponential relaxation whose typical time reasonably agrees with the\nexperiment.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nFusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide range of phenomena: phase transition in fluids\nand liquid mixtures or polymers, stability of foams and emulsions, or sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998).\nIt is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable attention. Most of the studies of this\nprocess have been devoted so far to the coalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics\nof the evolution before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the hydrodynamics inside\nand outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when the drops are within mesoscopic distance from each\nother (Yiantsios \\& Davis 1991). As a matter of fact, the composite drop that results from the coalescence of\ntwo drops relaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation of the flow inside\nand outside the drops (Nikolayev \\textit{et al.} 1996, Nikolayev \\& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to\nour knowledge, of the coalescence of two sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a\npreliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case of hemispherical water droplets\nwhich grow slowly on a plane surface at the expense of the surrounding atmosphere. This forms what is called\n``dew'' or ``breath figures'' (Beysens \\textit{et al.} 1991, Beysens 1995).\nThe drops eventually touch each\nother and coalesce to form an elongated composite drop, which then relaxes to a spherical cap or to a less\nelongated drop. We study the composite drop relaxation, which depends on the droplet size and morphology\n(contact angle $\\theta $). When the contact angle is large ($70^{\\circ }<\\theta <90^{\\circ }$), the composite\ndrop relaxes very rapidly (within a time frame of a video camera) to a hemispherical cap (Zhao \\& Beysens\n1995). The relaxation process also looks fast if the contact angle is small ($\\theta <20^{\\circ}$). However,\nin this case the drop never relaxes to a hemispherical cap. Its shape remains always complicated. We study\nhere the intermediate range of the contact angles where the composite drop relaxes to a near-hemispherical\ndrop. We report on two experiments where the contact angles are $30^\\circ$ and $53^\\circ$. We find that the\nrelaxation process can be described by an exponential function, with a typical time proportional to the\nradius of the drop.\n\nSuch a relaxation process cannot be accounted by the bulk dissipation of the flow inside the drops. Available\ninformation in the literature shows that there are no widely accepted theories because of the complicated\ninterplay between macroscopic and molecular scale phenomena (Blake \\& Haynes 1969, de Gennes 1985, Dussan \\&\nDavis 1986, Hocking 1994). We propose here a simple approach based on an Arrhenius factor coming from the\ngas-liquid transition that occurs in the vicinity of the contact line and that limits the contact line\nmobility.\n\n\\section{Experimental}\n\nWhen water vapor condenses on a cold substrate under partial-wetting conditions, one observes an assembly of\ndroplets (dew) that continuously grow and merge. We use this process to study the coalescence of sessile\ndrops. The surface properties of the substrate play a crucial role in this process through the contact angle.\nThe experiments consists in observing with a microscope the drops that grow at a low rate in a condensation\nchamber. The images before and after drop coalescence are studied by means of an image analysis system. The\ncondensation chamber involves a Peltier-element thermostat to lower the substrate temperature. The chamber is\na plexiglas box filled with $\\mathrm{{N}_{2}}$ gas saturated with water at room temperature ($22^{\\circ }$C).\nTo avoid dust and to saturate the gas, $\\mathrm{{N}_{2}}$ is bubbled in pure water. The gas flow is\ncontrolled with a flowmeter. All the experiments presented here are performed with $\\mathrm{{ N}_{2}}$\nsaturated with water at the flow rate of 13.5~$\\mathrm{{cm^{3}/s}}$. The substrate on which condensation\ntakes place is set on a 5~mm thick block made of electrolytic copper. This block ensures a homogeneous\ntemperature diffusion from the Peltier element to the substrate. The thermal contact is ensured by a silicon\nfree heat sink compound (Tech Spray). The temperature is monitored with a thermocouple of type K placed on\nthe copper block near the substrate. The experimental procedure consists in rapidly cooling the substrate\nfrom room temperature down to $15^{\\circ }$C. The growth of dew is observed with an optical microscope and\nrecorded with a CCD camera. The video data are analyzed by a digital processing system.\n\nThe surface of condensation is made of 0.7~mm thick glass wafers with 37~mm diameter. The surfaces are first\ncleaned with diluted fluorhydric acid, then with optical soap and finally rinsed with pure water and ethanol.\nThe cleaned substrates are baked up at $120^{\\circ }$C, dipped in a\nfluorochlorosilane (FClSi) solution and then put back in an oven at $\n120^{\\circ }$C for an hour. At this temperature the FClSi molecules are\nchemically grafted on the glass surface and do not react any more with\nwater. Several wafers were used for the experiments reported here.\n\nThe treated surface is hydrophobic. Water condenses on it as droplets with a finite contact angle $\\theta $.\nTo measure $\\theta $, a small drop of water (2~mm diameter) is deposited with a syringe on the substrate and\nobserved with a CCD camera through a macrolens. We report two sets of experiments for $\\theta =30^\\circ$ and\n$53^{\\circ }$. (The contact angle was made different by changing the experimental conditions.) The hysteresis\nof the contact angle was of order $15^{\\circ }$ in both cases.\n\nThe morphology of the coalescence-induced composite drop is analyzed as\nfollows. After calibration, we measure the contact area, the major and minor\naxes (the second one is taken perpendicularly to the first) for several\n``composite'' drops as a function of time. In Fig.~\\ref{1}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Fig1.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n\\caption{Photos of the coalescence process.

The return to\na spherical cap indicates that the surface roughness is small enough so as the contact line is not pinned in\na metastable state. Note the Fig.~\\ref{1}b where, within a time-frame (40~ms), one can observe the two\nparents and the child at the same time. This is because the video image is made of two interlaced frames with\n20~ms scanning time.\n\n\\section{Observation and preliminary analysis}\n\nIn such a process, we can analyze the behavior of several quantities of interest.\n\n\\subsection{Position of the center of mass}\n\nWe report in Figs.~\\ref{2}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Fig2a.eps}\\hspace*{7mm}\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Fig2b.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n\\caption{Evolution of the coordinates of the centers of mass of the parent drops (1, 2) and of the composite\ndrop 3 after coalescence. (a) abscissas (b) ordinates} \\label{2}\n\\end{figure}\nthe details of a typical coalescence event, similar to the one shown in Fig.~\\ref{1}. Here the parent drops\nare labeled 1 and 2. Drop 3 is the child drop. The coordinates ($x_{i}$, $y_{i}$) of the center of mass of\nthe drops $i = 1, 2$ and 3 are calculated from their contact area on the substrate. For drops 1 and 2, and\nthe late times of drop 3, drops are nearly hemispherical and this approximation is fully justified. A\ndifficulty comes when dealing with the early times of drop 3 that shows only one symmetry axis and whose 3-D\nshape cannot be determined from the pictures. However, its asymmetry with respect to the axis perpendicular\nto the symmetry axis is small. Therefore, we assume that the position of the center of mass can be calculated\nfrom the 2D formulas as if the drop were of homogeneous thickness. The calculation of the center of mass of\nthe system drop 1 + drop 2 can be performed according to the well-known formulas (here the contact angle does\nnot enter in the equation, because it is assumed to be the same for both drops):\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nx_{3} &=&\\frac{x_{1}R_{1}^{3}+x_{2}R_{2}^{3}}{R_{1}^{3}+R_{2}^{3}},\n\\label{mass} \\\\\ny_{3} &=&\\frac{y_{1}R_{1}^{3}+y_{2}R_{2}^{3}}{R_{1}^{3}+R_{2}^{3}},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $x_{i}$, $y_{i}$, $R_{i}$ are the coordinates and radius of drop $i$,\nwith $i=1,2,3$.\n\nBefore coalescence, during growth, the coordinates of the center of mass of the parents are reported in\nFigs.\\ref{2} with respect to the axes shown in Fig.\\ref{1}. We also report the evolution of the center of\nmass of the ensemble drop 1 + drop 2, calculated from the above Eq.\\ref{mass}. A small variation is observed.\nWe attribute it to the vicinity of neighboring drops, which distorts the gradient of water concentration\naround them. (Note that the mass transfer is maximum at the triple line, where the temperature gradient is\nmaximum (Steyer \\textit{et al.} 1992).\n\nAs already noted, the center of mass of drop 3 does not move during its relaxation towards a spherical cap.\nWe note, however, a systematic change of position between the coordinates of the drop 3 center of mass and\nthe center calculated from the ensemble drop 1 + drop 2. This deviation can be related to external forces,\nsuch as those that pin the contact line. As a matter of fact, the center of mass after coalescence is shifted\nto the largest drop (drop 2), that is, the drop showing the longest contact line.\n\n\\subsection{Relaxation of the composite drop}\n\nFig.~\\ref{3} shows a schematic view of the coalescence process.\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[height=4cm]{Fig3.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n\\caption{ Sketch of the coalescence event as in Figs.~\\ref{1}. (a), (b), (c) denote the time sequence.}\n\\label{3}\n\\end{figure}\nIn a simplified manner, the contact line of the child, or composite, drop can be assumed to be an ellipse of\nwidth $R_{x}$ (resp. $R_{y}$) along the small (resp. long) axes. The most obvious dynamical quantity to\nanalyze is the evolution of $R_{x}$ and $R_{y}$. A typical curve is shown in Fig.~\\ref{4}a,\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n  \\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Fig4a.eps}\\hspace*{7mm}\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Fig4b.eps}\\\\\n  \\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Fig4c.eps}\\hspace*{7mm}\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{Fig4d.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n\\caption{ Evolution of the (a) large and small axes, (b) perimeter, and (c) area of the  drops 1 and 2\n(\"parents\", see Figs.~\\ref{1}), and drop 3 (composite drop).

The coalescence process is characterized\nby three time regions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Nucleation of a liquid bridge between the two parent drops and subsequent\nformation of a convex composite drop occurs in a time period smaller than the half video scanning time, i.~e.\n20 ms (Fig.~\\ref{1}b). In the theoretical explanation sketched below, the corresponding dynamics is fast\nbecause, during the growth of this bridge, the contact line moves locally by vapor condensation, a process\nnot slowed down by an \\textit{a priori} Arrhenius factor.\\label{(i)}\n\n\\item Decrease of the large axis $R_{y}$ with time, small increase of the\nsmall axis $R_{x}$, such as the ratio $R_{y}/R_{x}$ eventually reaches a value about unity.\\label{(ii)}\n\n\\item Slow growth of the drop due to condensation.\\label{(iii)}\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe second regime (\\ref{(ii)}) takes most of the time of the coalescence process. Once the evolution of\n$R_{x}$ and $R_{y}$ is corrected from the slow growth observed in (\\ref{(iii)}), the evolution of the small\naxis $R_{x}$ is most often negligible and the evolution of the drop can be characterized by $R_{y}$ only.\n\nParameters other than $R_{y}$, as the liquid-solid contact area $A_{LS}$\n(Fig.~\\ref{4}c) or its perimeter $P$ (Fig.~\\ref{4}b), can give a useful\ninformation. Their behavior is quite similar to that of $R_{y}$. In the\nfollowing, we will discuss only the evolution of the contact area $A_{LS}$, a\nquantity which can be measured with the best accuracy. As shown in\nFig.~\\ref{4}c, the evolution of $A_{LS}(t)$ cannot be described by a power law.\nIt can, however, be successfully fitted to the following function\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nA_{LS}(t)=A_{0}\\exp [-(t-t_{0})/t_{c}]+A_{1}(t-t_{0})+A_{2}.  \\label{Fit}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"A_{LS}(t)=A_{0}\\exp[-(t-t_{0})/t_{c}]+A_{1}(t-t_{0})+A_{2}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06961.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $u$ is homogeneous to a velocity.

The statistical error corresponds to the values\nof the linear correlation coefficient 0.93 ($\\theta =53^{\\circ}$) and 0.87 ($\\theta =30^{\\circ }$).\n\nNote that $t_{c}$ should depend on the difference between the sizes of the two parent drops. However, this\ndependence is weak when the difference is small because the composite drop is nearly symmetrical, see\nFig.~\\ref{1}.\n\nThe relaxation time appears to be larger for $\\theta =53^{\\circ}$ than for $\\theta =30^{\\circ }$. This looks\nparadoxical since the relaxation driving force (see Eq.~\\ref{effeteta} below) should be larger for larger\nangles thus causing a smaller relaxation time. (As a matter of fact, for large angles $\\theta>70^\\circ$ the\nrelaxation becomes too fast to be measured within a video scanning time, which compares well with this\nargument.) The small relaxation time at small angles can be explained by the pinning of the contact line on\nsurface defects, leading to a metastable equilibrium in a shorter time, so that the total relaxation time\nbecomes smaller. The pinning is likely to occur for a smaller contact angle where the relaxation driving\nforce is smaller. For $\\theta\\le 20^\\circ$ the shape of the drops becomes quite complex and thus unsuitable\nfor analysis because of the contact line pinning (Zhao \\& Beysens 1995).\n\nThe detailed study of the contact angle dependence of $t_c$ is beyond the scope of this paper, which is\nfocused on the unexpected long relaxation time found in these experiments.\n\n\\section{Theoretical analysis}\n\nLet us consider first the relaxation of the drop to the spherical cap equilibrium shape as described by bulk\nhydrodynamics. The rate of relaxation of the slightly deformed drop is defined by three characteristic times.\nThe first of them is the inviscid inertial time $t_{e} = (\\rho\\,R^{\\ast \\,3}/\\sigma )^{1/2}$, where $\\rho$ is\nthe liquid density. The time $t_{e}$ accounts for the slowing down of the relaxation by the inertia of the\nliquid. The second is the viscous inertial time $t_{i}=R^{\\ast \\,2}/\\nu$, where $\\nu $ is the kinematic\nviscosity, which accounts for dissipation at high Reynolds number in the boundary layer. The third\ncharacteristic time is the time $t_b$ of the viscous relaxation driven by the surface tension $\\sigma $. It\nis given by the expression $t_b=R^{\\ast }\\eta /\\sigma $, where $\\eta $ is the shear viscosity.\n\nConsidering the data for water at $20^{\\circ }$C ($\\eta =10^{-3}$~Pa~s, $\\nu =10^{-6}$~m$^{2}$/s, $\\sigma\n=73$~mN/m), it is easy to check that all of these times calculated for water are many orders of magnitude\nless than the relaxation time reported in Fig.~\\ref{5} (nearly seven orders for the viscous flow\napproximation). This section deals with the explanation of this huge difference.\n\nThe relationship between the contact line motion and phase change was studied previously in a number of\nworks. The reaction of the liquid meniscus on the externally imposed contact angle change was analyzed by\nWayner (1993). He assumed implicitly that the vapor condenses homogeneously over the whole meniscus thus\ncausing the contact line to advance along the already prewetted solid surface. We note that the subsequent\nstudies (Anderson \\& Davis 1994, Nikolayev \\& Beysens 1999, Nikolayev \\textit{et al.} 2001) showed that the\nphase change rate varies along the meniscus being much larger in the contact line vicinity than on the other\npart of the meniscus. This effect was taken into account by Anderson \\& Davis (1995) who studied the\ninfluence of the evaporation on the value of the dynamic contact angle. The contact line was assumed to move\ndue to the non-zero liquid-solid slip coefficient.\n\nWe note that the previous studies of the volatile liquids relied on the already known mechanisms of the\ncontact line motion (de Gennes 1985) proposed for the non-volatile liquids. These mechanisms cannot explain\nthe very small factor $10^{-7}$ observed in our experiments.\n\nThe contact angle hysteresis that appears due to the surface defects is small and results in a small deviation\nof the final drop shape from that of the spherical cap, which would form in the absence of the hysteresis.\nThis deviation can be estimated from Fig. \\ref{4}a as $(R_y-R_x)/(R_y+R_x)\\approx 3\\%$, $R_x$ and $R_y$ being\ntaken for $t\\gg t_c$. The analysis of Nikolayev \\& Beysens (2001) shows that the week defects are not likely\nto cause such a strong change in the relaxation rate. This huge difference calls for a radical change in\ntheory.\n\nIt is well known that such very small non-dimensional factors appear very often in the presence of an\nactivation process that gives very small Arrhenius non-dimensional factors. For the contact line motion, it\nhas been proposed recently that such a factor should be present (Pomeau 2000) because of the following\nremark: the contact line, sticking on the solid, cannot move by hydrodynamic motion, since the fluid velocity\nis zero on the solid (no-slip condition). This condition can be satisfied during the contact line motion when\nthe evaporation (when the liquid is receding) or condensation (when the liquid is advancing) occurs in the\nvicinity of the contact line (Seppecher 1996). Although the rate of this phase change can be large (it is\nproportional to the contact line speed), it does not result in a strong mass change of the drop because of\nthe small part of the area where the phase change occurs. The rate of this process is therefore independent of\nthe small global condensation rate present in our experiments.\n\nHereafter, we shall consider the receding process only, that is, evaporation. This evaporation is a thermally\nactivated process because molecules in the liquid are in the bottom of a potential well, due to the\nattraction of the other molecules, an attraction necessary to keep the cohesion of the liquid against\nspontaneous self-evaporation. Therefore, the rate of evaporation should be proportional to a very small\nArrhenius factor\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17079, "prevtext": "\nThe first term corresponds to the relaxation of the composite drop, which dominates in regime (\\ref{(ii)})\nand the second and third term to the growth by condensation detected during period (\\ref{(iii)})\n(Fig.\\ref{4}d).

The free parameters in the fit are $t_{c}$, $A_{0}$, $A_{1}$, and $A_{2}$.\nThe area $A_{2}$ is related to the drop radius $R^{\\ast}$ at equilibrium (when the drop becomes a spherical\ncap) by $A_{2}=\\pi R^{\\ast^{2}}$.\n\nThere are three time scales that correspond to the regimes (\\ref{(i)}), (\\ref{(ii)}) and (\\ref{(iii)}).

On this third\nstage, the total liquid mass grow due to condensation, which is necessary to make the drops grow and\ncoalesce.

Note that, in contrast to the Molecular Kinetics theory, the\nArrhenius factor $K$ defined above is independent of the difference between the actual contact angle and its\nequilibrium value (and so is intrinsically very small and independent of the actual contact angle, as\nobserved).\n\nNow, it becomes simple to formulate the equations of motion for the relaxation of shape of the droplet: the\npure hydrodynamic phenomena (inertial or viscous) are so fast that they can be taken as having reached\nequilibrium for a given droplet contour on the solid. In other terms, all the dynamics is ``enslaved'' to the\nslowest process, the receding motion of the contact line driven by evaporation. Therefore the dynamics is as\nfollows: given a contour $\\Gamma$ for the droplet on the solid (a closed curve, i.~e. a triple contact line),\nand the volume of the droplet (its change of volume either by evaporation near the contact line or by\ncondensation from the supersaturated vapor is a relatively small effect on the time scale of the shape\nrelaxation), one computes the shape of the droplet by solving (numerically in general) Laplace's equation for\nthe surface of the droplet $z=z(x,y)$:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 23241, "prevtext": "\nwhere $u$ is homogeneous to a velocity.

The statistical error corresponds to the values\nof the linear correlation coefficient 0.93 ($\\theta =53^{\\circ}$) and 0.87 ($\\theta =30^{\\circ }$).\n\nNote that $t_{c}$ should depend on the difference between the sizes of the two parent drops. However, this\ndependence is weak when the difference is small because the composite drop is nearly symmetrical, see\nFig.~\\ref{1}.\n\nThe relaxation time appears to be larger for $\\theta =53^{\\circ}$ than for $\\theta =30^{\\circ }$. This looks\nparadoxical since the relaxation driving force (see Eq.~\\ref{effeteta} below) should be larger for larger\nangles thus causing a smaller relaxation time. (As a matter of fact, for large angles $\\theta>70^\\circ$ the\nrelaxation becomes too fast to be measured within a video scanning time, which compares well with this\nargument.) The small relaxation time at small angles can be explained by the pinning of the contact line on\nsurface defects, leading to a metastable equilibrium in a shorter time, so that the total relaxation time\nbecomes smaller. The pinning is likely to occur for a smaller contact angle where the relaxation driving\nforce is smaller. For $\\theta\\le 20^\\circ$ the shape of the drops becomes quite complex and thus unsuitable\nfor analysis because of the contact line pinning (Zhao \\& Beysens 1995).\n\nThe detailed study of the contact angle dependence of $t_c$ is beyond the scope of this paper, which is\nfocused on the unexpected long relaxation time found in these experiments.\n\n\\section{Theoretical analysis}\n\nLet us consider first the relaxation of the drop to the spherical cap equilibrium shape as described by bulk\nhydrodynamics. The rate of relaxation of the slightly deformed drop is defined by three characteristic times.\nThe first of them is the inviscid inertial time $t_{e} = (\\rho\\,R^{\\ast \\,3}/\\sigma )^{1/2}$, where $\\rho$ is\nthe liquid density. The time $t_{e}$ accounts for the slowing down of the relaxation by the inertia of the\nliquid. The second is the viscous inertial time $t_{i}=R^{\\ast \\,2}/\\nu$, where $\\nu $ is the kinematic\nviscosity, which accounts for dissipation at high Reynolds number in the boundary layer. The third\ncharacteristic time is the time $t_b$ of the viscous relaxation driven by the surface tension $\\sigma $. It\nis given by the expression $t_b=R^{\\ast }\\eta /\\sigma $, where $\\eta $ is the shear viscosity.\n\nConsidering the data for water at $20^{\\circ }$C ($\\eta =10^{-3}$~Pa~s, $\\nu =10^{-6}$~m$^{2}$/s, $\\sigma\n=73$~mN/m), it is easy to check that all of these times calculated for water are many orders of magnitude\nless than the relaxation time reported in Fig.~\\ref{5} (nearly seven orders for the viscous flow\napproximation). This section deals with the explanation of this huge difference.\n\nThe relationship between the contact line motion and phase change was studied previously in a number of\nworks. The reaction of the liquid meniscus on the externally imposed contact angle change was analyzed by\nWayner (1993). He assumed implicitly that the vapor condenses homogeneously over the whole meniscus thus\ncausing the contact line to advance along the already prewetted solid surface. We note that the subsequent\nstudies (Anderson \\& Davis 1994, Nikolayev \\& Beysens 1999, Nikolayev \\textit{et al.} 2001) showed that the\nphase change rate varies along the meniscus being much larger in the contact line vicinity than on the other\npart of the meniscus. This effect was taken into account by Anderson \\& Davis (1995) who studied the\ninfluence of the evaporation on the value of the dynamic contact angle. The contact line was assumed to move\ndue to the non-zero liquid-solid slip coefficient.\n\nWe note that the previous studies of the volatile liquids relied on the already known mechanisms of the\ncontact line motion (de Gennes 1985) proposed for the non-volatile liquids. These mechanisms cannot explain\nthe very small factor $10^{-7}$ observed in our experiments.\n\nThe contact angle hysteresis that appears due to the surface defects is small and results in a small deviation\nof the final drop shape from that of the spherical cap, which would form in the absence of the hysteresis.\nThis deviation can be estimated from Fig. \\ref{4}a as $(R_y-R_x)/(R_y+R_x)\\approx 3\\%$, $R_x$ and $R_y$ being\ntaken for $t\\gg t_c$. The analysis of Nikolayev \\& Beysens (2001) shows that the week defects are not likely\nto cause such a strong change in the relaxation rate. This huge difference calls for a radical change in\ntheory.\n\nIt is well known that such very small non-dimensional factors appear very often in the presence of an\nactivation process that gives very small Arrhenius non-dimensional factors. For the contact line motion, it\nhas been proposed recently that such a factor should be present (Pomeau 2000) because of the following\nremark: the contact line, sticking on the solid, cannot move by hydrodynamic motion, since the fluid velocity\nis zero on the solid (no-slip condition). This condition can be satisfied during the contact line motion when\nthe evaporation (when the liquid is receding) or condensation (when the liquid is advancing) occurs in the\nvicinity of the contact line (Seppecher 1996). Although the rate of this phase change can be large (it is\nproportional to the contact line speed), it does not result in a strong mass change of the drop because of\nthe small part of the area where the phase change occurs. The rate of this process is therefore independent of\nthe small global condensation rate present in our experiments.\n\nHereafter, we shall consider the receding process only, that is, evaporation. This evaporation is a thermally\nactivated process because molecules in the liquid are in the bottom of a potential well, due to the\nattraction of the other molecules, an attraction necessary to keep the cohesion of the liquid against\nspontaneous self-evaporation. Therefore, the rate of evaporation should be proportional to a very small\nArrhenius factor\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nK=\\exp(-\\frac{W}{k_{B}T}),  \\label{KEW}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"K=\\exp(-\\frac{W}{k_{B}T}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mi>W</mi><mrow><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06961.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $p$ is the Lagrange multiplier.

We have good\nreasons to deem that this dissipation is due to a gas-liquid phase transition at the portion of the\nvapor-liquid interface adjacent to the triple line. This dissipation introduces a very small $K\\sim 10^{-8}$\nArrhenius factor in the relation between the driving force and the contact line velocity. According to our\nidea, the dissipation appears when the contact line recedes so that local evaporation takes place. Further\ntheoretical and experimental work seems necessary to fully describe the evolution of such a coalescence\nphenomenon.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nWe thank the CEA/DAM in Limeil for their help with the surface coating. \\end{acknowledgments}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\\bibitem[1]{b1}\\textsc{Anderson, D.
