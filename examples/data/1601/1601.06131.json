Although we urge caution in \ngeneralising results from FRB~110523 to the broader FRB population, our analysis serves as a guide to interpreting future polarisation measurements of FRBs, and \npresents another means of elucidating the origins of these enigmatic ephemera.\n\t\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\n\npolarization --- scattering --- magnetic fields --- pulsars: general --- stars: magnetars --- extraterrestrial intelligence\n\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nOver the last 15 years, high-time resolution radio surveys at frequencies between 700\\,MHz and 1.5\\,GHz have revealed a set of \nmillisecond-timescale, broadband transients (fast radio bursts; FRBs) that are possibly extragalactic. The 16 published FRB discoveries are \nsummarised by \\citet{pbj+16}. The defining characteristics of FRBs are levels of cold-plasma \ndispersion that are unambiguously inconsistent \\citep[for discussion, see][]{kon+14} with the Milky Way free-electron density structure, \nand the lack of observed repeat bursts with the same dispersion measure (DM). Poor FRB localisations, limited \nfollow-up observations and the lack of credible transient counterparts in the positional error boxes have left the nature(s) of \nFRBs open to untamed speculation. In this paper, assuming that FRBs are extragalactic, we focus on the possibility that FRBs represent extreme \nforms of the radio emission we observe from Milky Way pulsars \\citep{cw15} or magnetars \\citep{tsb+13,pp10,pp13,kon15}. \n\nFRB~110523 was discovered at the Green Bank Telescope by \\citet{mls+15}, hereafter M15, in the 700\\,MHz to 900\\,MHz \nfrequency band. This burst was 44\\% linearly polarised, which enabled the measurement of Faraday rotation of the position angle (PA) of the polarisation \nplane. The degree of Faraday rotation was much larger than expected from the specific Milky Way sightline, and from the intergalactic medium. \nThis, combined with evidence for strong scattering from a turbulent medium close to the progenitor, led M15 to infer that the burst \npropagated through a dense, magnetised plasma in its host system. Remarkably, after correcting for the measured \nFaraday rotation, M15 found a monotonically varying polarisation PA of $\\sim20^{\\circ}$ within the 2\\,ms temporal evolution of the FRB, \nwhich is difficult to attribute to instrumental effects. \n\nThe PA variation in FRB~110523 is tantalisingly reminiscent of the pulses of radio pulsars. There, the linear polarisation vector  \nis assumed to be aligned with the magnetic field orientation in the emission region. Hence, linearly polarised radiation from pulsars is used to infer the \norientation of the rotation and magnetic axes \\citep[e.g.,][]{ew01}.  Assuming a global dipole field structure leads to a straightforward relation between the \npolarisation PA, the obliquity angle between the magnetic and rotation axes, $\\alpha$, and the smallest inclination angle, $\\beta$, between the line of \nsight and the magnetic pole associated with the emission.

In a few cases \n\\citep[M15;][]{tsb+13,rsj15}, the FRB pulse profile has been best modelled by the pulse-broadening function in Equation~(4) convolved with \nnarrower profiles. In other events, the pulse width was found to strongly increase with decreasing frequency.  For FRB~110523, the effects of \nboth pulse broadening and frequency scintillation were observed. A characteristic scattering propagation delay of $\\tau_{s}$ implies a \nscintillation bandwidth of $\\sim(2\\pi\\tau_{s})^{-1}$. Hence, the observation of a scatter broadening timescale of 1.66\\,ms at 800\\,MHz, combined \nwith a scintillation decorrelation bandwidth of 1.2\\,MHz was interpreted by M15 as suggestive of two instances of scattering, each \nimparting different characteristic propagation delays. \n\n\n\nThe effects of scatter broadening on the polarisation properties of pulsar pulse profiles have been investigated by \\citet{lh03} and \\citet{k09}. \nUnlike scintillation, the observation of pulse broadening caused by scattering implies that each time-frequency element of the pulse corresponds to the \nincoherent sum of many different scattered rays, with different propagation delays. Each scattered ray preserves its intrinsic polarisation properties. \nHowever, because scatter broadening causes signals corresponding to different parts of the intrinsic pulse to be mixed into each \ntime-frequency element, a pulse that has intrinsically varying polarisation properties will be (\\textit{a}) depolarised and (\\textit{b}) appear to have a \nless-variable polarisation PA. These effects are exacerbated by dispersion smearing caused by incoherent dedispersion. \n\nWe demonstrate these effects in Figure~1, where we attempt to match the observed polarisation PA measurements for FRB~110523 to the intrinsic emission \nproperties given the effects of scatter broadening and incoherent dedispersion. The left panel shows our adopted intrinsic pulse, and the right panel \nshows the simulated measurements of this pulse, after scatter broadening, using the M15 spectrometer system \n(4096 channels between 600\\,MHz and 800\\,MHz) and sampling time (1.024\\,ms). The simulated observations approximately match the PA measurements \npresented in Figure~3 of M15, with the exception of one egregious datum that has large uncertainty. We used the \nscatter broadening timescale and frequency-dependency ($\\tau_{s}=1.66$\\,ms at 800\\,MHz, $\\alpha=3.6$), and the intrinsic pulse full-width \nhalf-maximum of 1.73\\,ms, reported by M15. We assumed a Gaussian intrinsic pulse profile, a linear polarisation percentage of 50\\% (the exact \npercentage is irrelevant to the analysis), \nand a linear intrinsic PA variation across the pulse.\\footnote{M15 in fact attempted a statistical fit of a linear intrinsic PA variation to their data, \nwith limited success. This was attributed to substructure in the intrinsic pulse beyond the linear model.} \nThe adopted model uniquely corresponds to the simulated observations if the PA does not \nvary by more than $2\\pi$ within the sampling time. Although the most rapid PA variation observed by M15 was by $\\sim20^{\\circ}$ over $\\sim2$\\,ms, \nwe find that the intrinsic pulse PA may have varied by $\\sim40^{\\circ}$ over this time. We also show a case where an intrinsic PA variation of \n20$^{\\circ}$ over 2\\,ms is assumed (the dashed line and crosses in the top panels of Figure~1).

In this case, both the mixing and the delayed observation of rays that have undergone \ndifferent amounts of Faraday rotation would change the intrinsic PA of the burst. M15 inferred the presence \nof a dense magnetised circum-burst medium, which contributes significantly to the DM of the burst and dominates the Faraday rotation measure (RM). \nThe total Faraday rotation over a distance interval between $d_{1}$ to $d_{2}$ is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\rm RM} & = & 2.6\\times10^{-9} \\int_{d_{1}}^{d_{2}}n_{e}(s)B_{\\parallel}(s)ds \\\\\n& = & 80{\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel}\\,{\\rm rad\\,m}^{-2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $n_{e}$ is the electron number density, $B_{\\parallel}$ is the parallel component of the magnetic field (expressed \nin units of Gauss), $ {\\rm DM}_{12}$ is the dispersion measure between $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ in the units of cm$^{-3}$\\,pc, and $\\bar{B}_{\\parallel}$ is the \nmean magnetic field over this interval, where the averaging is after weighting by the local electron density, $n_{e}(s)$. For the frequency band in which FRB~110523 was \nobserved, two rays propagating over different paths $A$ and $B$ with DM-magnetic field products $({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{A}$ and \n$({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{B}$ respectively would have a frequency-averaged polarisation PA difference of \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 8193, "prevtext": "\n\nAdditionally, GHz radiation from compact sources is often observed to be scattered by free-electron density inhomegeneities \\citep{barney90}. \nScattering results in a single impulse propagating over multiple paths to the observer, with delays, $t$, relative to the shortest path that are \ntypically distributed proportionally to \\citep{w72}\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\ng(t) = e^{-t/\\tau_{s}}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"g(t)=e^{-t/\\tau_{s}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06131.tex", "nexttext": "\nNow, the 1.6\\,ms scattering time reported by M15 implies a characteristic angular difference between rays of $36[D_{\\rm scr}/(1\\,{\\rm kpc})]^{-1}$\\,mas, \nwhere $D_{\\rm scr}$ is the distance of the scattering screen from the source. M15 suggest that $D_{\\rm scr}<44$\\,kpc based on the \nscattered image being unresolved by a Milky Way scattering screen. \n\nLet us assume, as M15 conclude, that some of the DM and most of the RM arises close to the burst progenitor. \nThen, to produce the observed PA variation of $\\sim20^{\\circ}$ over approximately \nthe scattering timescale, we require that $|({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{A}-({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{B}|\\sim0.12$\\,cm$^{-3}$\\,pc\\,G. \nFor typical interstellar magnetic fields of order microGauss, or even for the extreme milliGauss magnetic fields found in dense star-forming regions, \nthis requires unrealistic DM differences between the propagation paths of $1.2\\times10^{2}$\\,cm$^{-3}$\\,pc to  $1.2\\times10^{5}$\\,cm$^{-3}$\\,pc. \nHowever, if we assign a DM of 100\\,cm$^{-3}$\\,pc to the circum-burst medium, a parallel magnetic field variation between the propagation paths of only 1.2\\,mG is \nrequired to explain the PA variation across the burst.

We therefore proceed \nto consider the polarisation PA variation of FRB~110523 in the context of the RVM, but with the caveat that the possible origin of the burst \nin a dense star-forming region or galactic-centre environment could also cause the observed PA variation. \n\n\n\\section{The rotating vector model: neutron star constraints}\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we apply the RVM to calculate the maximum allowed ranges of the obliquity, $\\alpha$, and the magnetic inclination, $\\beta$, of the \nburst progenitor for different rotation periods. Even if we assume that the RVM applies to FRB~110523, the rotation period is coupled to the \nvalues of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Qualitatively, to produce the observed PA variation, tighter upper bounds on \n$\\beta$ are expected for larger rotation periods, whereas the range of $\\alpha$ remains relatively unconstrained. For these constraints, the exact pulse phase \nrange assumed for the PA variation is not important. \n\n\nWe consider two cases for the PA variation: one that is due to the interpretation of M15 (20$^{\\circ}$ in 2\\,ms), and \none that corresponds to our expectation from \\S2 for the intrinsic PA variation before scattering (40$^{\\circ}$ in 2\\,ms). We show our results in Figure~2 for \neach case. The maximum allowed ranges displayed for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are calculated from Equation~(1); values outside these ranges \nfor each rotation period are not geometrically possible. Rotation periods shorter than 4\\,ms are forbidden by the RVM.\n\nWe do not attempt to present probabilistic constraints on the angles because our \nlack of prior knowledge of the system makes this of negligible value. We note that for each specific value of the spin period, there is a \none-to-one mapping between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. For periods between $\\sim5$\\,ms and $\\sim14$\\,ms, $\\alpha$ is \nmildly constrained because values of $\\alpha$ close to $90^{\\circ}$ \nwould imply too rapid a PA variation for any $\\beta$. For larger rotation periods, as expected, the upper bound on $\\beta$ decreases. For rotation \nperiods $>1$\\,s, $\\beta\\lesssim2^{\\circ}$ or $\\beta\\lesssim1^{\\circ}$ depending on the assumed PA variation. \n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\n\\subsection{Constraints on neutron-star progenitor models}\n\nIf FRB~110523 has a neutron-star progenitor, the polarisation profile is consistent with the RVM for a wide range of rotation periods. Although our analysis \nis rudimentary, being based only on the total PA variation over 2\\,ms, the constraints we obtain on $\\beta$ \nare interesting. However, we emphasise that we cannot distinguish between different progenitor periods, because in our analysis all periods have \ncombinations of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that reproduce the data equally well. We are not bold enough to statistically fit the two-parameter RVM to the three \nhighly significant PA measurements for FRB~110523, and this precludes us from undertaking model selection on the progenitor rotation period. \n\nA number of models for FRB progenitors posit magnetospheric emission from rotating neutron stars. \\citet{cw15} suggest that \nan extreme form of giant pulse emission from young pulsars at modest distances of a few hundred Mpc could explain the observed FRB population. \nMatching FRB rates to classes of astrophysical explosions has led multiple authors to associate FRBs with magnetar \nhyper-flares \\citep{tsb+13,pp10,pp13,kon15}. However, existing magnetar models for FRBs \\citep{l14,katz15} do not naturally predict a polarisation \nPA swing across the pulse in any circumstance. This is because the magnetic pulses expected during hyper-flares from magnetars are predicted to result in \nradio bursts upon interaction with magnetar wind nebulae, which do not co-rotate with the star. On the other hand, \nif we remain agnostic about the actual FRB emission mechanism associated with magnetar hyper-flares, then another option is that emission comes \nfrom near the surface of the star and is associated with the fireball \\citep{td95}. As the rotation periods of known magnetars are all $\\gtrsim 1$\\,s \\citep{ok14}, \nour results may provide stringent constraints on the magnetic field geometry associated with FRBs from hyper-flares, as explained below.\n\nAn arbitrarily chosen pulsar or magnetar is more likely to be slow-spinning than fast-spinning, owing to magnetic spin-down. For example, a rotating star with a \ndipole field strength at the pole of $B_{p}$ has a rotation period that evolves with time, $t$, proportionally to $(1+KB_{p}t)^{1/2}$, where $K$ is a constant \n\\citep{st86}. \nThe majority of radio pulsars have rotation periods $\\gtrsim0.1$\\,s \\citep{mht+05}, and all Galactic magnetars, which have estimated ages of tens of kyr, have even \nlarger rotation periods \\citep{ok14}. Our constraints on $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ indicate that, if FRB~110523 represents pulsar-like emission that \ncan be modelled with the RVM, one of two possibilities is allowed:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item the burst originates from a fast-rotating (and hence likely young) neutron star, in which case we cannot constrain the emission geometry, or\n\\item the burst originates from a more slowly rotating neutron star, consistent with the bulk of the pulsar population and the entire observed magnetar population. In \nthis case, if the rotation period of the progenitor is $>0.1$\\,s,  we constrain the emission to originate from within $20^{\\circ}$ of the magnetic pole, and likely within \n$10^{\\circ}$ after accounting for the effects of scattering. It is also possible that the emission originates from a magnetic field structure that is more complex, \nand hence possesses greater curvature, than the global dipole field. Such structures are expected as a result of the magnetohydrodynamical \ninstabilities that may trigger magnetar hyper-flares \\citep[e.g.,][]{td95,lzk+11}. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFurther inferences can be drawn by considering our results in the context of RVM analyses of the emission geometries of pulsars and magnetars. \nRadio emission from fast-rotating pulsars with large spin-down luminosities, including young and millisecond pulsars, is expected to cover large fractions of \n$4\\pi$ steradians, and to originate from high in the magnetosphere \\citep{rmh10}. Older, more slowly rotating pulsars are generally found to have narrower \nemission beams tied to one or both magnetic poles \\citep{lm88,r90,tm98}. Our constraints on $\\beta$ for different rotation periods are consistent with, but cannot \ndistinguish between, both scenarios. However, it is also found that pulsars are born with large values of $\\alpha$ that exhibit secular decreases with age \n\\citep{lm88}; this effect has indeed been observed in `real time' for the Crab pulsar \\citep{lgw+13}. Hence, if a neutron star progenitor of FRB~110523 \nwere to rotate slowly, it is possible that it is an aligned rotator, with small values of both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. \n\n\\subsection{Possible contaminating effects}\n\nAlthough we only have one burst of emission from the progenitor of FRB~110523, this does not imply a stochastic bias in our analysis. On the contrary, \nour single-pulse analysis is less susceptible to contamination by the orthogonally polarised modes (OPMs) commonly observed in pulsars \\citep{br80,nv82}. \nSingle pulses from many pulsars are observed to switch between two OPMs, which have varying predominance at different pulse longitudes. Such behaviour \nis also observed in rotating radio transients \\citep[e.g.,][]{khv+09}. Some care is required to account for OPMs in RVM fits to integrated \npulse profiles \\citep[e.g.,][]{nv82,ew01}. However, our analysis of a single pulse is indeed more optimal than analyses of integrated pulse profiles as the PA \nmeasurements are not the averages of pulses in different polarisation modes. \n\nHowever, even if the progenitor of FRB~110523 is a neutron star, other effects may contaminate our RVM inferences. We have already noted the possibility \nthat if the burst originates in a dense, highly magnetised environment, the observed polarisation PA variation could be induced by varying magnetic fields \nalong multiple propagation paths (\\S2.2). Further, the emission at different times likely \ntraverses different paths through the magnetosphere which may result in different degrees of Faraday rotation \\citep{km98}. \n\nIf the emission originates at $\\lesssim20$\\,km from the neutron-star surface, Lense-Thirring precession results in additional observed curvature of \nmagnetic field lines \\citep{mt92}, and \naberration and retardation can also cause distortions in the observed field-line geometry for polar-cap emission \\citep[e.g.,][]{gg01}. \nPropagation effects in the magnetosphere could also play a role in mimicking PA swings \\citep{cr79}. \n\nPerhaps of more relevance are \nthe polarisation properties of giant pulses from pulsars, and individual radio pulses from magnetars. \\citet{jpk+10} reported on the polarisation \nproperties of nanosecond-timescale giant pulses from the Crab pulsar, which have been considered as direct analogues of FRBs by \\citet{cw15}. Although substantial pulse-to-pulse \nvariation is seen, some giant pulses show tens of degree PA variations on timescales of a few nanoseconds. Such extreme PA swings are either indicative of \nemission from incredibly close to the magnetic pole, or of the relativistic effects mentioned above or proper motion of the emitting structures. \nFurthermore, evidence of magnetospheric \npropagation-related mixing of linear and circular polarisation is observed in some magnetars \\citep{ksj+07}. \n\n\\subsection{Generalising our results to the FRB population}\n\nClearly, caution is required in generalising our results to the full FRB population. In analogy with the different gamma-ray burst populations observed by \ninstruments with different sensitivities and spectral responses, different radio telescopes may be sensitive to different \npopulations of FRBs. Besides the Parkes telescope, FRB candidates have only been detected at the Arecibo Observatory (FRB~121102) and the Green Bank \ntelescope (FRB~110523). However, we note that the lower limit on the fluence of FRB~110523 reported by M15 of 1.9\\,Jy\\,ms is comparable \nto the Parkes and Arecibo FRBs. Further, the fluence of FRB~110523 will be attenuated by free-free absorption in the circum-burst medium. The free-free \noptical depth, assuming a temperature of 8000\\,K for the circum-burst medium, is \\citep[][and references therein]{kon15}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 14638, "prevtext": "\nHere, $\\tau_{s}$ is the characteristic propagation delay caused by the scattering, which is frequency dependent (that is, \n$\\tau_{s}\\propto \\nu^{-\\alpha}$).

In a few cases \n\\citep[M15;][]{tsb+13,rsj15}, the FRB pulse profile has been best modelled by the pulse-broadening function in Equation~(4) convolved with \nnarrower profiles. In other events, the pulse width was found to strongly increase with decreasing frequency.  For FRB~110523, the effects of \nboth pulse broadening and frequency scintillation were observed. A characteristic scattering propagation delay of $\\tau_{s}$ implies a \nscintillation bandwidth of $\\sim(2\\pi\\tau_{s})^{-1}$. Hence, the observation of a scatter broadening timescale of 1.66\\,ms at 800\\,MHz, combined \nwith a scintillation decorrelation bandwidth of 1.2\\,MHz was interpreted by M15 as suggestive of two instances of scattering, each \nimparting different characteristic propagation delays. \n\n\n\nThe effects of scatter broadening on the polarisation properties of pulsar pulse profiles have been investigated by \\citet{lh03} and \\citet{k09}. \nUnlike scintillation, the observation of pulse broadening caused by scattering implies that each time-frequency element of the pulse corresponds to the \nincoherent sum of many different scattered rays, with different propagation delays. Each scattered ray preserves its intrinsic polarisation properties. \nHowever, because scatter broadening causes signals corresponding to different parts of the intrinsic pulse to be mixed into each \ntime-frequency element, a pulse that has intrinsically varying polarisation properties will be (\\textit{a}) depolarised and (\\textit{b}) appear to have a \nless-variable polarisation PA. These effects are exacerbated by dispersion smearing caused by incoherent dedispersion. \n\nWe demonstrate these effects in Figure~1, where we attempt to match the observed polarisation PA measurements for FRB~110523 to the intrinsic emission \nproperties given the effects of scatter broadening and incoherent dedispersion. The left panel shows our adopted intrinsic pulse, and the right panel \nshows the simulated measurements of this pulse, after scatter broadening, using the M15 spectrometer system \n(4096 channels between 600\\,MHz and 800\\,MHz) and sampling time (1.024\\,ms). The simulated observations approximately match the PA measurements \npresented in Figure~3 of M15, with the exception of one egregious datum that has large uncertainty. We used the \nscatter broadening timescale and frequency-dependency ($\\tau_{s}=1.66$\\,ms at 800\\,MHz, $\\alpha=3.6$), and the intrinsic pulse full-width \nhalf-maximum of 1.73\\,ms, reported by M15. We assumed a Gaussian intrinsic pulse profile, a linear polarisation percentage of 50\\% (the exact \npercentage is irrelevant to the analysis), \nand a linear intrinsic PA variation across the pulse.\\footnote{M15 in fact attempted a statistical fit of a linear intrinsic PA variation to their data, \nwith limited success. This was attributed to substructure in the intrinsic pulse beyond the linear model.} \nThe adopted model uniquely corresponds to the simulated observations if the PA does not \nvary by more than $2\\pi$ within the sampling time. Although the most rapid PA variation observed by M15 was by $\\sim20^{\\circ}$ over $\\sim2$\\,ms, \nwe find that the intrinsic pulse PA may have varied by $\\sim40^{\\circ}$ over this time. We also show a case where an intrinsic PA variation of \n20$^{\\circ}$ over 2\\,ms is assumed (the dashed line and crosses in the top panels of Figure~1). The propagated PA variation in this case clearly \ndoes not match the data of M15. \n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.9,angle=-90]{fig2.ps}\n\\caption{Upper bounds on the possible range of magnetic field inclinations, $\\alpha$, and impact parameters, $\\beta$, \nfor a pulsar-like progenitor of FRB~110523.

In this case, both the mixing and the delayed observation of rays that have undergone \ndifferent amounts of Faraday rotation would change the intrinsic PA of the burst. M15 inferred the presence \nof a dense magnetised circum-burst medium, which contributes significantly to the DM of the burst and dominates the Faraday rotation measure (RM). \nThe total Faraday rotation over a distance interval between $d_{1}$ to $d_{2}$ is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\rm RM} & = & 2.6\\times10^{-9} \\int_{d_{1}}^{d_{2}}n_{e}(s)B_{\\parallel}(s)ds \\\\\n& = & 80{\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel}\\,{\\rm rad\\,m}^{-2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $n_{e}$ is the electron number density, $B_{\\parallel}$ is the parallel component of the magnetic field (expressed \nin units of Gauss), $ {\\rm DM}_{12}$ is the dispersion measure between $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ in the units of cm$^{-3}$\\,pc, and $\\bar{B}_{\\parallel}$ is the \nmean magnetic field over this interval, where the averaging is after weighting by the local electron density, $n_{e}(s)$. For the frequency band in which FRB~110523 was \nobserved, two rays propagating over different paths $A$ and $B$ with DM-magnetic field products $({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{A}$ and \n$({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{B}$ respectively would have a frequency-averaged polarisation PA difference of \n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta{\\rm PA} = 170\\times|({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{A}-({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{B}|\\,{\\rm deg}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta{\\rm PA}=170\\times|({\\rm DM}_{12}\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{A}-({\\rm DM}_{12}%&#10;\\bar{B}_{\\parallel})_{B}|\\,{\\rm deg}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>PA</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>170</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>DM</mi><mn>12</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>\u2225</mo></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>DM</mi><mn>12</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>\u2225</mo></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>B</mi></msub></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>deg</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06131.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\bar{n}_{e}$ is the mean electron density along the line of sight, and $z$ is the cosmological redshift. This implies an attenuation factor of \n$\\sim1.6$. \n\nThe PA variation exhibited by FRB~110523 implies that the burst is temporally resolved even after accounting for \nscatter broadening. This is consistent with the unscattered pulse full-width half-maximum  of 1.7\\,ms reported by M15, which is \nsignificantly greater than the maximum dispersion smearing timescale within the frequency band (Equation~3) of $\\Delta t_{d} = 0.74$\\,ms. \nIn contrast, neither of the Parkes FRBs for which a pulse broadening function (Equation~4) was fit \\citep[FRB~110220, FRB~131104;][]{tsb+13,rsj15} \nwere temporally resolved after the scattering was accounted for. For FRB~110220, the upper limit on the intrinsic width set by dispersion smearing was \n1\\,ms, and the corresponding upper limit for FRB~131104 was 0.5\\,ms. This may indicate a difference between FRB~110523 and the Parkes FRB sample. \n\nBesides FRB~110523, the only reported polarisation measurement for an FRB (140514) is from Parkes \\citep{pbb+15}, where \nthe burst was found to be 21\\% circularly polarised with no linear polarisation. Although nanosecond-timescale structures in giant pulses from the Crab pulsar \ncan be highly circularly polarised, the even split between left and right circular polarisation means that the sum of these structures usually shows only \nlinear polarisation \\citep{jpk+10}. Circular polarisation in pulsars is also commonly associated with magnetospheric propagation effects \\citep{cr79}. Further,  \nlinear polarisation can be depolarised if Faraday rotation causes rapid wrapping of the phase between Stokes Q and U over individual spectrometer channels; \nhowever, an RM in excess of $10^{5}$\\,rad\\,m$^{-2}$ is required for FRB~140514 to be completely depolarised \\citep{pbb+15}. Hence, \nas a minimum, further polarisation measurements are required for FRBs from multiple telescopes in order to understand whether the implications \nof our RVM analysis can be generalised to all FRBs. Coherent dedispersion will also likely enable intrinsic pulse widths to be resolved. \nIf FRBs represent pulsar-like bursts from rotating, magnetised neutron stars, it is likely that at least some will repeat on observable timescales \\citep{cw15}. \n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have examined the variation in the polarisation PA within FRB~110523 in the context of a rotating, magnetised neutron star \nprogenitor for the burst. We account for the effects of the observed scattering of the burst by considering two cases for the PA variation: \n$20^{\\circ}$ in 2\\,ms as reported by M15, and $40^{\\circ}$ in 2\\,ms, which we demonstrate to approximately correspond to the intrinsic PA variation before scattering. \nBy analysing these PA variations with the rotating vector model commonly used to ascertain pulsar emission geometries \\citep{rc69}, we find that \nif a neutron-star progenitor of FRB~110523 were slowly-rotating (e.g., with rotation period $>0.1$\\,s), the emission must originate from close to \na magnetic pole (magnetic inclination $\\beta<20^{\\circ}$, and $<10^{\\circ}$ after accounting for scattering). We conclude that\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item FRB~110523 is consistent with the RVM, given empirical results for pulsars in the Milky Way.\n\\item If the burst represents pulsar-like emission from a rapidly rotating (and hence likely young) neutron star, we cannot constrain the emission geometry. \n\\item If the burst represents pulsar-like emission from a more slowly rotating (and hence likely older) neutron star, the emission may either originate \nfrom close to a magnetic pole, or from a complex local field structure. In the former case, given the typical alignment between the rotation and \nmagnetic axes of older neutron stars, the progenitor may be an aligned rotator. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nHowever, even if the progenitor of FRB~110523 is a rotating, magnetised neutron star, various effects may bias our RVM analysis. For example, the \nobserved PA variation could be caused by (\\textit{a}) varying magnetic fields along different propagation paths if the burst originates in a dense, highly \nmagnetised region, or (\\textit{b}) magnetospheric propagation effects or intrinsic motion of the emitting region. Additionally, we also cannot ascertain whether our \nconclusions apply to some or all FRBs. That is, it is unclear whether all FRBs have the same origin and whether that origin is pulsar-like. To aid in generalising \nour conclusions, further high-quality polarisation measurements with coherent dedispersion instruments are required from multiple telescopes. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nVR acknowledges enlightening discussions with S.

We therefore proceed \nto consider the polarisation PA variation of FRB~110523 in the context of the RVM, but with the caveat that the possible origin of the burst \nin a dense star-forming region or galactic-centre environment could also cause the observed PA variation. \n\n\n\\section{The rotating vector model: neutron star constraints}\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, we apply the RVM to calculate the maximum allowed ranges of the obliquity, $\\alpha$, and the magnetic inclination, $\\beta$, of the \nburst progenitor for different rotation periods. Even if we assume that the RVM applies to FRB~110523, the rotation period is coupled to the \nvalues of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Qualitatively, to produce the observed PA variation, tighter upper bounds on \n$\\beta$ are expected for larger rotation periods, whereas the range of $\\alpha$ remains relatively unconstrained. For these constraints, the exact pulse phase \nrange assumed for the PA variation is not important. \n\n\nWe consider two cases for the PA variation: one that is due to the interpretation of M15 (20$^{\\circ}$ in 2\\,ms), and \none that corresponds to our expectation from \\S2 for the intrinsic PA variation before scattering (40$^{\\circ}$ in 2\\,ms). We show our results in Figure~2 for \neach case. The maximum allowed ranges displayed for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are calculated from Equation~(1); values outside these ranges \nfor each rotation period are not geometrically possible. Rotation periods shorter than 4\\,ms are forbidden by the RVM.\n\nWe do not attempt to present probabilistic constraints on the angles because our \nlack of prior knowledge of the system makes this of negligible value. We note that for each specific value of the spin period, there is a \none-to-one mapping between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. For periods between $\\sim5$\\,ms and $\\sim14$\\,ms, $\\alpha$ is \nmildly constrained because values of $\\alpha$ close to $90^{\\circ}$ \nwould imply too rapid a PA variation for any $\\beta$. For larger rotation periods, as expected, the upper bound on $\\beta$ decreases.

Although our analysis \nis rudimentary, being based only on the total PA variation over 2\\,ms, the constraints we obtain on $\\beta$ \nare interesting. However, we emphasise that we cannot distinguish between different progenitor periods, because in our analysis all periods have \ncombinations of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ that reproduce the data equally well. We are not bold enough to statistically fit the two-parameter RVM to the three \nhighly significant PA measurements for FRB~110523, and this precludes us from undertaking model selection on the progenitor rotation period. \n\nA number of models for FRB progenitors posit magnetospheric emission from rotating neutron stars. \\citet{cw15} suggest that \nan extreme form of giant pulse emission from young pulsars at modest distances of a few hundred Mpc could explain the observed FRB population. \nMatching FRB rates to classes of astrophysical explosions has led multiple authors to associate FRBs with magnetar \nhyper-flares \\citep{tsb+13,pp10,pp13,kon15}. However, existing magnetar models for FRBs \\citep{l14,katz15} do not naturally predict a polarisation \nPA swing across the pulse in any circumstance. This is because the magnetic pulses expected during hyper-flares from magnetars are predicted to result in \nradio bursts upon interaction with magnetar wind nebulae, which do not co-rotate with the star. On the other hand, \nif we remain agnostic about the actual FRB emission mechanism associated with magnetar hyper-flares, then another option is that emission comes \nfrom near the surface of the star and is associated with the fireball \\citep{td95}. As the rotation periods of known magnetars are all $\\gtrsim 1$\\,s \\citep{ok14}, \nour results may provide stringent constraints on the magnetic field geometry associated with FRBs from hyper-flares, as explained below.\n\nAn arbitrarily chosen pulsar or magnetar is more likely to be slow-spinning than fast-spinning, owing to magnetic spin-down. For example, a rotating star with a \ndipole field strength at the pole of $B_{p}$ has a rotation period that evolves with time, $t$, proportionally to $(1+KB_{p}t)^{1/2}$, where $K$ is a constant \n\\citep{st86}. \nThe majority of radio pulsars have rotation periods $\\gtrsim0.1$\\,s \\citep{mht+05}, and all Galactic magnetars, which have estimated ages of tens of kyr, have even \nlarger rotation periods \\citep{ok14}. Our constraints on $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ indicate that, if FRB~110523 represents pulsar-like emission that \ncan be modelled with the RVM, one of two possibilities is allowed:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item the burst originates from a fast-rotating (and hence likely young) neutron star, in which case we cannot constrain the emission geometry, or\n\\item the burst originates from a more slowly rotating neutron star, consistent with the bulk of the pulsar population and the entire observed magnetar population. In \nthis case, if the rotation period of the progenitor is $>0.1$\\,s,  we constrain the emission to originate from within $20^{\\circ}$ of the magnetic pole, and likely within \n$10^{\\circ}$ after accounting for the effects of scattering. It is also possible that the emission originates from a magnetic field structure that is more complex, \nand hence possesses greater curvature, than the global dipole field. Such structures are expected as a result of the magnetohydrodynamical \ninstabilities that may trigger magnetar hyper-flares \\citep[e.g.,][]{td95,lzk+11}. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFurther inferences can be drawn by considering our results in the context of RVM analyses of the emission geometries of pulsars and magnetars. \nRadio emission from fast-rotating pulsars with large spin-down luminosities, including young and millisecond pulsars, is expected to cover large fractions of \n$4\\pi$ steradians, and to originate from high in the magnetosphere \\citep{rmh10}. Older, more slowly rotating pulsars are generally found to have narrower \nemission beams tied to one or both magnetic poles \\citep{lm88,r90,tm98}. Our constraints on $\\beta$ for different rotation periods are consistent with, but cannot \ndistinguish between, both scenarios. However, it is also found that pulsars are born with large values of $\\alpha$ that exhibit secular decreases with age \n\\citep{lm88}; this effect has indeed been observed in `real time' for the Crab pulsar \\citep{lgw+13}. Hence, if a neutron star progenitor of FRB~110523 \nwere to rotate slowly, it is possible that it is an aligned rotator, with small values of both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. \n\n\\subsection{Possible contaminating effects}\n\nAlthough we only have one burst of emission from the progenitor of FRB~110523, this does not imply a stochastic bias in our analysis. On the contrary, \nour single-pulse analysis is less susceptible to contamination by the orthogonally polarised modes (OPMs) commonly observed in pulsars \\citep{br80,nv82}. \nSingle pulses from many pulsars are observed to switch between two OPMs, which have varying predominance at different pulse longitudes. Such behaviour \nis also observed in rotating radio transients \\citep[e.g.,][]{khv+09}. Some care is required to account for OPMs in RVM fits to integrated \npulse profiles \\citep[e.g.,][]{nv82,ew01}. However, our analysis of a single pulse is indeed more optimal than analyses of integrated pulse profiles as the PA \nmeasurements are not the averages of pulses in different polarisation modes. \n\nHowever, even if the progenitor of FRB~110523 is a neutron star, other effects may contaminate our RVM inferences. We have already noted the possibility \nthat if the burst originates in a dense, highly magnetised environment, the observed polarisation PA variation could be induced by varying magnetic fields \nalong multiple propagation paths (\\S2.2). Further, the emission at different times likely \ntraverses different paths through the magnetosphere which may result in different degrees of Faraday rotation \\citep{km98}. \n\nIf the emission originates at $\\lesssim20$\\,km from the neutron-star surface, Lense-Thirring precession results in additional observed curvature of \nmagnetic field lines \\citep{mt92}, and \naberration and retardation can also cause distortions in the observed field-line geometry for polar-cap emission \\citep[e.g.,][]{gg01}. \nPropagation effects in the magnetosphere could also play a role in mimicking PA swings \\citep{cr79}. \n\nPerhaps of more relevance are \nthe polarisation properties of giant pulses from pulsars, and individual radio pulses from magnetars. \\citet{jpk+10} reported on the polarisation \nproperties of nanosecond-timescale giant pulses from the Crab pulsar, which have been considered as direct analogues of FRBs by \\citet{cw15}. Although substantial pulse-to-pulse \nvariation is seen, some giant pulses show tens of degree PA variations on timescales of a few nanoseconds. Such extreme PA swings are either indicative of \nemission from incredibly close to the magnetic pole, or of the relativistic effects mentioned above or proper motion of the emitting structures. \nFurthermore, evidence of magnetospheric \npropagation-related mixing of linear and circular polarisation is observed in some magnetars \\citep{ksj+07}. \n\n\\subsection{Generalising our results to the FRB population}\n\nClearly, caution is required in generalising our results to the full FRB population. In analogy with the different gamma-ray burst populations observed by \ninstruments with different sensitivities and spectral responses, different radio telescopes may be sensitive to different \npopulations of FRBs. Besides the Parkes telescope, FRB candidates have only been detected at the Arecibo Observatory (FRB~121102) and the Green Bank \ntelescope (FRB~110523). However, we note that the lower limit on the fluence of FRB~110523 reported by M15 of 1.9\\,Jy\\,ms is comparable \nto the Parkes and Arecibo FRBs. Further, the fluence of FRB~110523 will be attenuated by free-free absorption in the circum-burst medium. The free-free \noptical depth, assuming a temperature of 8000\\,K for the circum-burst medium, is \\citep[][and references therein]{kon15}\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\tau_{\\rm ff} = 0.47 \\frac{\\rm DM}{100\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}\\,{\\rm pc}}\\frac{\\bar{n}_{e}}{5000\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}}\\left[\\frac{\\nu(1+z)}{700\\,{\\rm MHz}}\\right],\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\tau_{\\rm ff}=0.47\\frac{\\rm DM}{100\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}\\,{\\rm pc}}\\frac{\\bar{n}_{e}%&#10;}{5000\\,{\\rm cm}^{-3}}\\left[\\frac{\\nu(1+z)}{700\\,{\\rm MHz}}\\right],\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>ff</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>0.47</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mi>DM</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>100</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mi>cm</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>pc</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>e</mi></msub><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>5000</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>cm</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>700</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>MHz</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
