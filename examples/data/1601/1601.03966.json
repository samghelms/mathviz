One can thus conclude that  Bell's Hypothesis (BH), i.e. the physical and mathematical assumptions leading to BI, do not correspond to an acceptable description of nature. \n\nThe precise implications of this statement remain open, especially if one asks about the resulting description of physical reality, as offered by Quantum Mechanics (QM). Quoting for instance Scott Aaronson \\cite{Scott}, one would have to choose between ``to describe the ``reality\" behind quantum processes via the Many-Worlds Interpretation, Bohmian mechanics, or following Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation, refuse to discuss the ``reality'' at all''.\n\nHere we want to move away from this apparent dilemma, by considering  that there is little to change to Bohr's Copenhagen Interpretation to obtain a fully consistent  ``quantum realism\", compatible with QM and with the above experiments, but also with physical realism, defined as the statement that {\\it the goal of physics is to study entities of the natural world, existing independently from any particular observer's perception, and obeying universal and intelligible rules} (see also \\cite{philo}). \n\nThis {\\bf quantum realism} has been presented in ref. \\cite{FooP},  under the acronym CSM, standing for Contexts, Systems and Modalities. Here we will briefly summarize its main features, and discuss in more details how to use it to better understand the failure of BH. As it is well known, this failure of BH corresponds to a rejection of local realism, but not - as we will show - of physical realism. It can rather be considered as an evidence for a quantum realism, which is clearly different from classical realism, and which has some specific non-local feature - however, these features have nothing to do with any ``spooky action a distance\".  We will thus assume that  (i) the quantum formalism is correct, and (ii) physical realism as defined above can be used to describe  the natural world. Then the dilemma appearing in the quotation above finds its roots in the difficulty to make (i) and (ii) compatible, as it has been much debated in the literature \\cite{EPR,Bohr,Heisenberg,Bell,Moon,Contextuality,pg2,Mermin,PBR}, giving rise to many different interpretations of QM \\cite{Frank}. \n\nHere we want to make the quantum formalism (i) and physical realism (ii) both correct  and compatible, so that many different views and practices about QM can stay essentially unchanged. As usual, there is a price to pay, but the currency will be ontological:  it will be a subtle but deep change in  what is meant by physical properties, which should not any more be considered as properties of the system itself, but jointly attributed to the system, and to the context in which it is embedded (precise definitions will be given below). We will show also that this ontological change has strong links with quantization as a basic physical phenomenon, and that this combination can explain why QM must be a probabilistic theory. \n\nThis article is closely related to \\cite{FooP}, with some parts condensed and others expanded, in order to spell out how the CSM approach explains quantum non-locality. \n\n\n\\section{System, context, and modalities}\n\nTo define an ontology  within the physical framework we are interested in, we will start with the question: which phenomena can we predict with certainty, and obtain repeatedly~?  Here certainty and repeatability of  \nphenomena will be  used to provide necessary conditions to be able to define a ``state''. Such an approach, supported by quantum experiments, has a clear relationship with the criteria for physical reality given by EPR \\cite{EPR} -- but the ``object\" to which it applies will be quite different. \n\nOur quantum ontology involves three different entities. First comes the \\textbf{system}, that is a subpart of the world that is  isolated well enough to be studied. The system is in contact with other systems, that can be a measuring device, an environment - no need to be more specific at this point. The ensemble of these other systems will be called a \\textbf{context}. A given context corresponds to a given set of questions, that can be asked together to the system about its physical properties. A set of answers that can be predicted with certainty and obtained repeatedly within such a context will be called a \\textbf{modality}.  \n\nGiven these definitions, let us bind them together by the following rule: {\\bf In QM, modalities are attributed jointly to the system and the context. } This principle will be called ``CSM\", referring to the combination of Context, System, and Modality.  As a set of certain and repeatable phenomena, a modality fulfills  the above conditions for the objective definition of a quantum state, and within the usual QM formalism (which is not here yet), a modality corresponds to a pure state. On the other hand,  the context is classical, in the sense that no other context has to be specified to define its state, and within the usual QM formalism, it corresponds to the parameters defining the observables as operators.  We note that here neither size, nor a quantitative criterium has been made to draw the quantum-classical boundary:  the quantum vs classical behavior is only related to the CSM principle itself, i.e., to the very definition of a modality. \n\nTaking a single polarized photon as an example, the system is the photon, the $\\theta$-oriented polarizer is the context, and the two mutually exclusive modalities in this context are either ``transmitted\", or ``reflected\".  In the CSM perspective, a photon does not ``own\" a polarization, but the ensemble photon-polarizer does.  If the context is known, and if the system is available, a modality defined in this same context can be recovered without error. This property has been exploited for years by quantum communication technologies, and provides the core of quantum cryptography protocols \\cite{BB84}. Here, we draw the consequences of this behavior in ontological terms. \n\nThe resulting ontology is clearly different from the classical one,  where it is expected that a state should ``exist\" independently of any context.\nBut even if CSM is fundamentally non-classical, physical realism is not lost: it still pertains to the ensemble made of context, system, and modality. Objectivity, defined as the independence from any particular observer's perception, is still guaranteed, but {\\it the ``object\" comprises both the system and the context, and its ``properties\" are modalities \\cite{Contextuality,pg2}}.\n\nFinally, after quoting EPR at the beginning of this section, let us emphasize that the CSM principle is not foreign to  Bohr's view, as expressed in his answer to the EPR argument \\cite{EPR,Bohr}: {\\it ``The very conditions which define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior of the system constitute an inherent element of the description of any phenomenon to which the term {\\bf physical reality}  can be properly attached\". } \nHere Bohr explicitly states that despite being classical, the ``very conditions\" (i.e., the context) must appear together with the system in the description of quantum phenomena. \n\n\\section{Quantization and probabilities}\n\nNow, a basic feature  is that in a given context, the modalities are ``mutually exclusive'', meaning that if one modality is true, the others are wrong. On the other hand, modalities obtained in different contexts are generally not mutually exclusive: they are said to be ``incompatible\", meaning that if one modality is true, one cannot tell whether the others are true or wrong.\nThis terminology applies to modalities, not to contexts, that are classically defined: changing the context results from changing the measurement apparatus at the macroscopic level, that is, ``turning the knobs''. \nThese definitions allow us to state the following quantization principle:\n\n{\\bf \n(i) For each well-defined system and context, there is a discrete number $N$ of mutually exclusive modalities; the value of $N$ is a property of the system within the set of all relevant contexts, but does not depend on any particular context. \n\n(ii) Modalities defined in different contexts are generally not mutually exclusive, and they are said to be ``incompatible''.}\n\nOtherwise stated, whereas infinitely many questions can be asked, corresponding to all possible contexts, only a finite number $N$ of mutually exclusive modalities can be obtained in any of them\\footnote{This principle is reminiscent of other approaches which bound the information extractable from a quantum system  \\cite{Rovelli,AZ}. However, in the realist perspective we chose, quantization has not a purely informational character, but characterizes reality itself.}. \nAn essential consequence is that it is impossible to get more details on a given system by combining several contexts, because this would create a new context with more than $N$ mutually exclusive modalities, contradicting the above quantization principle. As shown in \\cite{FooP}, this makes that quantum mechanics must be a probabilistic theory, not due to any ``hidden variables\", but due to the ontology of the theory.  Looking for instance at photon polarization, the number $N=2$ makes it  impossible to define a  (certain and repeatable) modality corresponding to  the photon being transmitted through a polarizer oriented at $0^{\\circ}$, {\\bf and} through a polarizer oriented at $45^{\\circ}$, because then there would be 4 such modalities, in contradiction with $N=2$. \nTherefore the only relevant question to be answered by the theory is: given an initial modality  in context $C_1$, what is the {\\it conditional probability} for obtaining another modality when the context is changed from $C_1$ to $C_2$ ? This probabilistic description is the unavoidable consequence of the impossibility to define a unique context making all modalities mutually exclusive, as it would be done in classical physics. It is therefore a joint consequence of the quantization and CSM principles, i.e. that modalities are quantized, and require a context to be defined. \n\n\\section{About the EPR-Bell argument}\n\nWe can now discuss in more details the EPR argument \\cite{EPR} and Bell's theorem  \\cite{aaview,Bell-EPR}. To do so,  let us consider two spin 1/2 particles in the singlet state, shared between Alice and Bob. The singlet state is a modality among four mutually exclusive modalities defined in a context relevant for the two spins, where measurements of the total spin \n(and any component of this spin)  will certainly and repeatedly give a zero value. On the other hand, the singlet state \nis incompatible with any modality attributing definite values to the spin components of the two separate particles in their own (spatially separated) contexts.\nAccording to the previous section, the singlet modality is thus certain and repeatable in its own context (e.g., measurement of the total spin), but can only provide probabilities for the values of the spin components of the two separate particles. \n\nNow, let us assume that Alice performs a measurement on her particle, far from Bob's particle. Alice's result is random as expected, but what happens on Bob's side? Since Bob's particle is far away, the answer is simply that nothing happens. How to explain the strong correlation between measurements on the two particles? By the fact that after her measurement, Alice can predict with certainty the state of Bob's particle; however, this certainty applies jointly to the new context (owned by Alice) and to the new system (owned by Bob). The so-called ``quantum non-locality\" arises from this separation, and the hidden variables from the impossible attempt to attribute properties to Bob's particle only, whereas properties must be attributed jointly to Alice's context and Bob's system. Getting them together is required for any further step, hence the irrelevance of any influence on Bob's system following Alice's measurement. Here the separation between context and system is particularly obvious and crucial, since they are in different places. \n\nAccording to the above reasoning, after Alice's measurement on one particle from a pair of particles in a singlet state, the ``reality\" is a modality for Bob's particle, within Alice's context.  But Bob may also do a measurement, independently from Alice, and then  the ``reality\" will be a modality for Alice's particle, within Bob's context.   Does that mean that we have two ``contradictories\" realities ?  Actually no, because these realities are contextual \\cite{Contextuality,pg2}:  for instance Alice's modality tells that if Bob uses the same context as Alice, he will find with certainty a result opposite to Alice's one (given the initial singlet state). This statement is obviously true, as well as the one obtained by exchanging Alice and Bob. \nBut if Bob does a measurement in another context (different from Alice's), then one gets  a probabilistic change of context for a $N=2$ system,  as described before.\n\nIf Alice and Bob both do measurements with different orientations of their analyzers, the simplest reasoning is to consider \nthe complete context for both particles,  which is initially a joint context (with a modality being the singlet state) and finally two separated contexts, \nagain with 4 possible modalities due to the quantization postulate. Then this is now a probabilistic change of context for a $N=4$ system, \nagain with the same result. \n\nIt is interesting to write a few equations about these initial,  ``intermediate\" and final  modalities,  \nbecause this allows us to see more explicitly where CSM differs from Bell's hypothesis, even before the quantum formalism is introduced. \nSo let us denote $a_i$, $b_j$  the modalities with results $i, \\; j = \\pm 1$ for some orientation (context)  $a$ for Alice, and $b$ for Bob. Given some ``hidden variables\" $\\lambda$, and using the vertical bar ``|\"  as the usual notation for conditional probabilities $p(X|Y)$, Bell's hypothesis are :\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "$$p(a_i, b_j | \\lambda) = p(a_i | \\lambda) \\; p(b_j | \\lambda) $$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"p(a_{i},b_{j}|\\lambda)=p(a_{i}|\\lambda)\\;p(b_{j}|\\lambda)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>p</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo rspace=\"5.3pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>p</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03966.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhereas they are for Bob, who knows $\\mu$ and $b_j$\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15517, "prevtext": "\nThe equivalent CSM equations, given the initial joint modality $\\mu$, are for Alice,  who knows $\\mu$ and $a_i$\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "$$p(a_i, b_j | \\mu) = p(a_i | \\mu) \\; p(b_j | \\mu, a_i)$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"p(a_{i},b_{j}|\\mu)=p(a_{i}|\\mu)\\;p(b_{j}|\\mu,a_{i})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>p</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>p</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo rspace=\"5.3pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>p</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>b</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03966.tex", "nexttext": "\nSo these equations clearly differ from Bell's hypothesis, though there is no action at a distance, and no faster than light signalling.

This equivalence between an entanglement scheme and a ``prepare and measure\" scheme has been extensively used in security proofs of quantum cryptography. \n\nSo we get a simple explanation about  the famous ``peaceful coexistence\" between QM and relativity, i.e. why quantum correlations are non-local, but also ``no signalling\" (they  don't allow one to transmit any faster than light signal): this is because when Alice makes a measurement, the change from \n $\\mu$ to  $(\\mu, a_i)$ corresponds to a change of context, and not to any influence at a distance. This change of context (from joint to separate) redefines a new modality, which always involve both a system and a context. Such a situation, though strongly non-classical, does not conflict with physical realism  or causality: in the CSM perspective, quantum non-locality is a direct consequence of the  bipartite nature of quantum reality.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe shall conclude with a few remarks, see also  ref. \\cite{FooP}. \n\nFirst, contextual objectivity \\cite{Contextuality,pg2} allows for an ontology to QM, as the joint reality of the context, system, and modalities (CSM). This leads to reinterpret quantum nonlocality as the situation where the context and the system are separated in space: though the certainty (modality) is present, it cannot be ``verified\"  as long as the context and the system are not put together again. Such a situation has no conflict with physical realism, but never happens in classical physics, where the physical properties are carried by the system alone. \n\n\nSecond, let us note that for many physicists, putting the context in the very heart of the theory implied an unacceptable ``shifty split\" \\cite{Bell,Mermin} between the quantum world (attributed to the system) and the classical world (of the context). A lot of efforts have been made to get rid of it, especially to make the classical world emerge from the quantum world, by attempts to describe  contexts within the quantum formalism. Such attempts may exploit the fact that there is a lot of  flexibility for defining the boundaries of the system, especially when considering that (weak or strong) measurements can be done by entangling the initial system with more and more ``ancillas\", leading to the so-called ``Von Neumann regression\" \\cite{JvN}. \nBut in our approach, extending measurements to include the context is self-contradictory: even by adding many ancillas, \nthe system can never grow up to the point of including the context, simply because without the context, modalities cannot be defined. In other words, looking at  the system as a fuzzy object including everything is not consistent with our physically  realist ontology. \n\nThe quantum-classical boundary has therefore a fundamental character, both from a physical and from a philosophical point of view \\cite{FooP}. \nFrom this, the CSM approach does not restrict the generality nor the applicability of QM, but acknowledges  that, as a scientific discipline, QM ``can explain anything, but not everything\" \\cite{Peres-Zurek}.\n\n\nThird, it is clear that in its practical consequences CSM is close to the usual Copenhagen point of view (CPV), so it may be interesting to discuss also the differences.  A first one is that quantum reality as defined in CSM deviates from CPV, where reality is rather a word to be avoided \\cite{Scott}.  Whereas CPV may be accused of dogmatism (hidden behind mathematical formulas), the ontological claims of CSM have some flavor of empiricism: their goal is to provide a physically realist view of QM ``as it is done\", including in all the recent BI tests. \n\nThis can also be illustrated by considering ``decoherence theory\" \\cite{Zurek, Fine,PhT}, which has made a lot of progress during recent years. Considering that in an actual measurement, the system interacts with ancillas, entanglement is created, and observations are made, decoherence theory provides criteria to decide when and why a ``big\" ancilla does not behave as a quantum system any more. But  this is done by using QM, and thus - in the CSM view - only makes sense with respect to an external context, always required for defining modalities and using the quantum formalism \\cite{PhT}. Said otherwise, starting from a vector $|\\psi \\rangle$ in an Hilbert space, and then trying to ``deduce\" the classical world,  appears as circular by construction, because (from the beginning) $|\\psi \\rangle$ is a mathematical object associated with a modality, i.e. with a phenomenon involving both the ``classical\" and ``quantum\" worlds. Therefore decoherence theory perfectly fits  within CSM, being admitted that the goal is not to reconstruct the classical world -- it is already there -- but  to show  that quantum mechanics is a consistent theory. Said otherwise, QM is extraordinarily efficient for managing the ``split\", but cannot get rid of it, because it is built within the formalism - loosely speaking, as the difference between observables (contexts) and states (modalities). \n\nAs a final remark, Bohr's arguments in \\cite{Bohr} were quite right, but perhaps failed to answer a major question asked in essence by EPR in  \\cite{EPR}: can a physical theory be ``complete\" if it does not provide an ontology that should be clearly compatible with physical realism~? Unveiling such an ontology is what we propose to do here.\n\\\\ \n\n\n\\noindent{\\bf Acknowledgements:} \nThe authors thank Nayla Farouki for essential contributions, and Franck Lalo\\\"e, Francois Dubois, Anthony Leverrier, \nMaxime Richard,  Augustin Baas, Cyril Branciard for many useful discussions. \n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{Delft}   B.

Everything will be fine as far as relativistic causality is concerned, but a fully non-classical form of non-locality will remain, due to the fact \nthat the context and the system can be in different places.

However, there is some non-locality, in the sense that the result on one side depends on the result on the other side; but this is only through a (local) redefinition of the context, not through any influence at a distance onto the remote particle. Again, it is essential  to consider that the modality belongs jointly to the particle(s) {\\bf and} to the context, and not to the particle(s) only, otherwise one would be lead to Bell's hypothesis  \\cite{M-W}. \n\nAnother important consequence is that  if Alice and Bob both do measurements, their realities must ultimately agree together, since there will be a unique final modality $(a_i, b_j)$.
