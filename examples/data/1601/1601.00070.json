Space Communication Complex (CDSCC) located in the Australian Capital Territory (hereafter referred to as `Tid-70m').\nA small fraction of its time is devoted to radio astronomy and it is important to maximise the scientific return on this time. \nAs such developments have been under way to implement On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping capabilities, to allow for an efficient survey option.\nFollowing the preliminary work of \\cite{young}, we present full details of the implementation of OTF mapping at the telescope allowing for greater mapping efficiency.\nMore efficient spatial mapping of the ammonia inversion transitions in the 17--27\\,GHz K-band is a strong driver of the implementation of OTF on the Tid-70m, but the technique may be used to map other radio lines, such as radio recombination lines (RRLs) that fall in\nthe cm-wave bands.\nWe used OTF mapping with Tid-70m to observe the H92$\\alpha$ RRL at 8.3\\,GHz towards the prominent Galactic {\\sc Hii} region Orion\\,A (Ori\\,A) and the Galactic Centre feature Sagittarius\\,A (Sgr\\,A).\n\nOTF mapping involves sampling the sky while the antenna is moving at a constant rate, rather than integrating at a discrete position on the sky, then moving to the next position. The technique is widely used by mm- and submm-wave telescopes to produce large-scale maps in molecular transitions and the greybody continuum, such as CO~3--2 mapping towards M\\,83 \\citep{aste_co}, maps of CO and 1.1\\,mm continuum emission towards Ori\\,A  \\citep{cont}, and 90\\,GHz maps of star-forming clumps \\citep{jackson}. Detailed descriptions of the technique have been presented by \\citet{mang} and \\citet{saw}. \nImplementation of OTF mapping at the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) Mopra telescope has yielded several large mapping surveys \\citep[e.g.][]{magma, jones, mopragal}.\n\n\\cite{2012MNRAS.425.2352P} reviewed the physics of hydrogen RRL emission: the populations depart significantly from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) over frequency ranges that depend on the electron density. \\citeauthor{2012MNRAS.425.2352P} consider ALMA and EVLA observations of compact high-density \\textsc{Hii} regions, but also show that for the larger, less dense \\textsc{Hii} regions that might be mapped with a single-dish telescope, non-LTE effects are important in the centimetre-wavelength range. \\cite{RRL_book} used a non-LTE analysis to show how the line brightness varies with frequency and electron density. We may therefore estimate the electron density from the frequency dependence of line brightness.\nThe line brightness depends on electron temperature and density, so RRL maps can be used to infer the structure of ionised gas \\citep[e.g.][]{1978ApJ...226..869J}.\n\n\\section{Observing process}\n\\label{obs_pro}\n\nWhile many OTF scan patterns can be implemented, we have used the simplest, the raster (Fig.~\\ref{pattern}), which is optimised for mapping rectangular regions.\nRaster scanning moves the telescope on-source, `ON', in a straight line, then offsets by a fraction of a beam, perpendicular to the scan direction, before moving the telescope in the opposite direction.\nAn emission-free reference position, `OFF', is also observed to correct for the bandpass. \nAs the telescope moves across the source, the spectrometer samples data at regular intervals.\n\nOur implementation is a variation of the raster geometry, where the order of observing on-source or reference position is flexible: an OFF can be observed before or after an ON, or after multiple ON scans (see \\S\\ref{sec:ant} and \\ref{sec:spec} for details).\nMaps can be made in either ($\\alpha\\cdot\\cos\\,\\delta_{0}$, $\\delta$) or (\\textit{a}$\\cdot\\cos e_0$, $e$) coordinate systems, with the scan direction parallel to either coordinate axis \\footnote{$a, e$ are azimuth and elevation. $\\delta_{0}$ is the declination of the starting position of the observation. The longitudinal coordinates are referred to as cross-Dec and cross-El in the telescope control system.}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.46\\textwidth]{OTF_raster_pattern}\n\\caption{\nThe sequence of steps in an OTF observation.\nThe target region to be mapped is shown as a shaded rectangle.  \nThe solid line indicates telescope movement, starting and stopping at the crosshairs, during which the spectrometer is continuously sampling. \nThe dashed line shows telescope movement without spectrometer sampling. \nIn this example, every scan row is observed before making an OFF measurement, shown as a shaded circle.\n}\n\\label{pattern}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Software Architecture}\n\\label{sec:ctrl_sw}\nThe OTF observing mode was implemented on the control software \\textsc{auto\\_spec}, a \\textsc{perl} based script that acts as an interface to the telescope and spectrometer.\nThis software sends commands via two \\textsc{perl} modules: network monitor control (\\textsc{nmc.pm}) and correlator (\\textsc{corr.pm}). \nThese commands are sent to the antenna pointing control (\\textsc{apc}) and the user interface (\\textsc{tkcor}) respectively.\nThe \\textsc{nmc} module interacts with NASA controlled modules of the telescope.\nThe commands the \\textsc{nmc} module sends are: setting position; offset; slew rate; stop and stow. \nThe module also retrieves information on the current {\\it a} and {\\it e} coordinates, offsets, slew rate and supplementary information (temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation and time).\nThe antenna logs that are generated by the \\textsc{nmc} module contain telescope commands and records of the position.\nThe \\textsc{corr} module interacts with the user interface \\textsc{tkcor}, a \\textsc{Perl/Tk} module that is the interface of the process \\textsc{dummsy}.\n\\textsc{dummsy} sends commands to the physical correlator.\nLogs from the spectrometer are generated from \\textsc{corr.pm}.\nFig.~\\ref{schematic}. is a schematic illustration of the architecture of the software control system.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{OTF_schematic}\n\\caption{Schematic illustration of the telescope system. \nThe rounded rectangles are processes involved with OTF, rectangles are individual instruments and cylinders represent data storage and files.}\n\\label{schematic}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Antenna}\n\\label{sec:ant}\n\nThe commands to move the telescope come from the schedule file, setting the parameters of the observation, containing positional information for the reference position and starting position on source, time on source and frequency.\nScanning axis and direction for on-source scanning are programmed into the control software \\textsc{auto\\_spec} before observations begin.\nIn a typical OTF mapping observation, where a reference position is taken, first, then a single on source observation:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\t\\item OTF mapping begins with integrating on an emission-free reference position;\n\t\\item the telescope slews to the start position of the target source;\n\t\\item the OTF scan starts with \\textsc{auto\\_spec} commanding the telescope control to settle on the $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ starting point before moving the telescope in a set direction at a constant rate with a timer starting;\n\t\\item the scan rate of the telescope is calculated based on the beam size, and sampling rate:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \nR =

recorded both circular polarisations with 64~MHz bandwidth, sampling at a quarter FWHM with the minimum three second intervals.\nThe beam has FWHM 1.8\\arcmin, and individual scans (map rows) were spaced by 30\\arcsec\\ in Dec, while the telescope scanned along the $\\alpha\\cdot\\cos\\,\\delta_{0}$ axis.\nA schedule file parameter set the time taken for the telescope to complete each scan: \nThese observations used 120s-long scans with 30s integrations on the reference position.\nThe Hanning function was not applied for the maps presented, as RRLs are broad spectral features, so Hanning is not required.\nOpacity correction was not applied to our maps, but attenuation due to opacity would be within 5\\% at the lowest elevation during the 8\\,GHz observations.\nThere was no comparison to a flux calibrator source, but our observations agree within 10\\% with those of \\cite{Cesarsky}.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\caption{Table showing the different sources observed, the date observed, the

Observations at these frequencies therefore present an opportunity to probe the electron density directly through RRLs, and large-scale mapping of RRLs at these frequencies may allow us to map electron density structure.\n\nThe data points in Fig.~\\ref{fig:OrionA_soro_lit} generally lie near the model curves for electron densities of 100 and 200~cm$^{-3}$. \nPoints lying significantly away from these tracks are at an uncertain position (7.8\\,GHz) or an upper limit (24.5\\,GHz). Estimates of the electron density towards Ori\\,A generally lie at least an order of magnitude higher:\n\\cite{1984A&A...135..116S} calculated an electron density of (1$\\pm$ 0.3)$\\times 10^{4}$~cm$^{-3}$, based on Stark broadening of RRLs, and \\cite{2007AJ....133..952G} suggest the electron density is generally around 2000~cm$^{-3}$ throughout Ori\\,A, based on optical spectroscopy.\n\n\\citet{2007AJ....133..952G} found a layer of low-electron-density emission towards \nOri\\,A, lying in front of the main ionised region, and blueshifted. Fig.~\\ref{fig:OrionA_soro_lit} shows that low-electron-density gas emits very strongly around 10\\,GHz, so it is possible\nthat much of the H92$\\alpha$ emission that we see arises in lower-density material.\n\\cite{1995ApJ...438..784W} modelled the dense layer of ionised material in Ori\\,A as being 0.1--0.2~pc thick, so the denser gas might account for less than half of the \n$4\\times 10^{6}$\\,cm$^{-6}$pc emission measure; hence there could be a large amount of \nlow-density gas to generate the RRLs.\nTo confirm this possibility,  a full spatial analysis of RRLs across frequencies and comparison to continuum maps would be required, falling outside the scope of this paper.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm ,clip=true, width=0.5\\textwidth]{OrionA_spectra}\n\\caption{H92$\\alpha$ spectrum towards Ori\\,A at the position of peak $T_L$ (coordinates top right).} \n\\label{fig:OrionA_spectra}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\caption{\nTable containing Hydrogen RRL transition, rest frequency, peak brightness temperature (T$_{A}$), beam efficiency, line brightness temperature corrected for beam efficiency (T$_{L}$) and available publications with single dish observation towards Ori\\,A in the H\\textit{n}{$\\alpha$} RRL.\nThe H109$\\alpha$ T$_{L}$ appears to be have already been corrected for beam efficiency \\citep{1978ApJ...226..869J}.

A}\n\nSgr\\,A has been mapped interferometrically in the H92$\\alpha$ RRL using the VLA \\citep{1993ApJ...418..235Z, 1993ApJS...86..133R, 2001AJ....121.2681L, 1997ApJ...481.1016L}, but the high resolution of these maps rules out simple comparisons to our data.\n\n\\cite{1976A&A....46..407P} and \\cite{1980A&A....85...26P} used the 100-m Effelsberg telescope to map H85$\\alpha$ and H109$\\alpha$ RRL emission towards the Sgr\\,A region. \nContinuum subtraction was applied on the Sgr\\,A data set, although due to the strong Sgr\\,A non-thermal emission affecting the entire band profile, there still remains some continuum emission seen in the maps as broadband emission in the southern peak ($\\delta<-28^{\\circ}55\\arcmin$).\nHowever, we see a `peanut' shape in our H92$\\alpha$ map (Fig~\\ref{fig:SGA}) similar to that seen by \\citet{1976A&A....46..407P} in H85$\\alpha$ (10\\,GHz, 1.3$\\arcmin$ beam);\nour channel map (Fig~\\ref{fig:SGA_channel}) and the spectrum towards the emission peak (Fig.~\\ref{fig:SgrA_spectra}) are consistent with the finding of \\citeauthor{1980A&A....85...26P} that the dominant H109$\\alpha$ (5\\,GHz, 2.6$\\arcmin$ beam) emission occurs at $V_{LSR}\\sim -40$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[trim = 0cm 0cm 0cm 0cm ,clip=true,

mapping on the 70-m}\n\nOur maps use a 30\\arcsec\\ row spacing, more finely-sampled than the Nyquist row spacing criteria suggested by \\citet{mang}, resulting in oversampling of the rows.\nOur scan rate implies an oversampling factor \\citep[$n_{os}$ in Eq.\\,10,][]{mang} close to 1.5 for Sgr\\,A and 2 for Ori\\,A.\n\n\nMapping a region the size of Ori\\,A (18.9$\\arcmin \\times$17.5$\\arcmin$ map) by position switching would take  about 25~hours, an order of magnitude more than the time taken to map it with OTF (Table~\\ref{tab:regionInfo}).\nThe major contributor to the time requirement for position switching is the telescope motion overhead, as the telescope moves back and forth between the map position and the reference. \nFrom OTF mapping logs, each such movement takes 12--32\\,s, 25\\,s on average. \nMost of this time is required to accelerate, decelerate and settle the telescope, so it is likely not to be strongly dependent on the distance to the reference position.\nBecause mapping of the bright hydrogen RRLs only requires a few seconds' integration (compared to the tens of seconds of movement overhead), RRL mapping probably gains the most efficiency from OTF.\n\nThe ammonia inversion transitions in the 17--27\\,GHz K-band are widely used to probe the temperature of cold dense gas; OTF may be used to map these lines.\nA $10\\arcmin\\times 10\\arcmin$ position-switching map with 60\\,s integration on-source per position, mapped at half-beam spacing will take $\\sim 29$~h and reach rms noise of $\\sim 0.07$\\,K. This sensitivity is likely to be useful for ammonia analysis. To map a similar area with OTF, spacing map rows by half a beam and sampling each row every third of a beam, using the minimum 3\\,s integration time, takes 1.4~hours, achieving an estimated rms noise of 0.3~K.\nCo-adding 12 repeated maps (taking into account that the OTF map is more densely sampled than the position-switched map), will yield an rms of $\\sim 0.07$\\,K in $\\sim 17$~hours, about 0.6 of the time required for the position-switching map. \nEach row of the OTF map takes 150\\,s, so the reference position is checked every 3.5\\,min; 4\\,min is the approximate maximum time between reference spectra at K-band.\nK-band observations will require opacity and gain-curve corrections for the corrected temperature scale (T$_{A}^{*}$) which is applied after importing into \\textsc{casa}. \nSmoothing using the Hanning function can be applied at a later stage.\n\nFor compact ammonia sources, observing efficiency can be increased by averaging the ends of the scan rows as an OFF spectrum in the data processing, removing the need for a reference scan.\nThis approach will require reformatting the raw file to allow \\textsc{casa} to separate on-source spectra from OFF spectra for processing. \n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:concl}\nThe 70-m Tidbinbilla radio telescope is now capable of on-the-fly (OTF) spectral line mapping. We have tested the new observing mode by mapping radio recombination line emission towards Orion~A and Sagittarius~A: Our data are consistent with published data towards these regions.\n\nWe have combined our measurement of the peak brightness towards Orion~A with other measurements from the literature over a wide range of frequency, and plotted the line brightnesses over the theoretical curves of \\citet{soro}. The line brightness measurements are most consistent with electron densities of \n100--200\\,cm$^{-3}$, much lower than usual estimates of the electron density of the Orion nebula. This discrepancy may reflect the more efficient RRL emission from lower-density gas. Comparison of RRL brightness over a wide frequency range has the potential to constrain the electron density of large ionised regions, but this requires large-scale mapping to allow different beams to be compared as well as to analyse spatial structure. OTF mapping, which is highly efficient at mapping RRLs, can enable this analysis.\n\nBecause of the long times required for the Tid-70m to switch between source and reference, large maps of bright lines (such as RRLs) are very efficiently mapped by OTF, while smaller maps of fainter lines (requiring longer integration times) do not gain as much. At K-band, the requirement to go to a reference position every $\\sim 4$\\,min sets a limit to the mapping efficiency that can be achieved. Even so, maps of ammonia inversion transitions should be significantly more efficient using OTF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\nDSS-43 is part of the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex (CDSCC), which is managed by CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science.\nG.W. thanks the director of CDSCC Dr. E.
