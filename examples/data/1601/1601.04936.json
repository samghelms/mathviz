The initial velocities of the particles are chosen randomly within the low velocity regime such that their initial kinetic energies are small compared to the potential height of both lattices. In this section, we present the main results and discuss the underlying physical mechanisms in the following sections. \n\nIn the case of only a substrate lattice being present, we do not observe directed transport (case I in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}). This is to be expected, because the corresponding equation of motion (Eq.~(\\ref{eq2}) with $\\gamma_V=0$) is invariant under time reversal: $t\\rightarrow -t$, thus preventing directed particle motion in unbiased systems \\cite{Flach2000}. Applying the carrier lattice additionally ($\\gamma_V=1$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq2})) and choosing appropriate `phase shifts' to the substrate ($\\phi \\neq 0, \\pi$ and $\\delta \\neq 0, \\pi$) allows one to break both time reversal and parity symmetry which leads indeed to directed transport (case II in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}). This transport slowly accelerates and finally saturates at $\\bar v_{\\text{II}}\\simeq -1.25$ which is comparable to the spread of the velocity distribution of the particles. This constitutes an unusually high efficiency for a Hamiltonian ratchet, where the mean drift velocity is typically one or two orders of magnitude less than the standard deviation of the particle velocity distribution. We now consider the same situation, but switch off the carrier lattice, instantaneously, at $t=0.11 t_{\\rm tot}$ (blue dot; case III in Fig.~\\ref{fig2})). Interestingly, after switching off the carrier lattice the transport persists. Rather than decaying back towards zero, as one might expect for a symmetric setup, it does not decay but is frozen at its value of the time of the switch. That is, our atomic ensemble travels with constant average speed through the symmetrically oscillating lattice. Remarkably, this allows for an intriguingly simple real time control of the transport velocity: Once the desired transport is achieved one simply needs to switch off the carrier lattice.\n\nWe now consider a similar case, but switch the carrier lattice subsequently on and off (case IV in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}). Once the transport has been frozen for a while we can accelerate it by switching on the carrier lattice again (second green dot on case IV curve). Switching it off, for a second time (second blue dot), freezes also this enhanced transport at a constant strength. Clearly, to achieve a highly flexible real time control of the transport it would be desirable to be able to slow it down. This can in fact be achieved by switching on the carrier lattice again, but this time with a phase difference of $\\phi=-\\pi/2$ to the substrate (red dot). \nWe see in Fig.~\\ref{fig2} that this indeed slows the transport systematically down. Overall, we demonstrated a remarkably simple protocol allowing to enhance, freeze or slowdown the transport of atomic ensembles in two optical lattices on demand. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.072]{fig_3.pdf}\n\\caption{\\small The position (mod L) and velocity of all the $N$ particles (green) at (a) $t=0.04 t_{\\rm tot}$ in case I superposed on the PSOS P1(black dots and lines) of the substrate lattice (b) $t=0.42 t_{\\rm tot}$ in case III superposed on the PSOS P2(black dots) corresponding to both the substrate and the carrier lattices and (c) $t=0.95 t_{\\rm tot}$ in case IV superposed on the PSOS P3(black dots) corresponding to both the lattices but with  $\\phi=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

Hence to understand it we perform a systematic analysis of its microscopic composition and analyze its dynamical occupation by the considered particle ensemble. First, to understand the structure of the phase space itself, we take `stroboscopic' snapshots of particles with different initial conditions leading to Poincar\\'{e} surfaces of sections (PSOS) which provide a representative overview of the structure of the complete 3D phase space \\cite{Tabor1989}. We also exploit the spatial periodicity of our setup and project the particle position back to the first unit cell $x \\in [0,L)$ of the lattice. The PSOS of the substrate lattice (henceforth referred to as P1) is symmetric about $v=0$ (Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a black dots) and contains a large central `chaotic sea' $\\mathcal{C}^1_{\\rm C}$ between $v\\simeq \\pm 1.6$. On top of the PSOS, we show the snapshot of the particle coordinates, at a given time, used to determine $\\bar{v}$ in case I of Fig.~\\ref{fig2} (green dots in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a) illustrating the uniform symmetric chaotic diffusion of particles through the lattice resulting in no transport. The chaotic sea is bounded by the first invariant spanning curves (FISC; red lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a) which prevents acceleration of our low velocity initial conditions beyond $|v| > 1.6$. Contrarily, a particle with initial condition on one of the regular invariant curves at $|v| \\gtrsim 1.6$ (black lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a) shows ballistic unidirectional motion through the lattice. \n\n\nLet us now explore how the phase space structure changes in presence of the carrier lattice. Most prominently, the two lattice PSOS (black dots in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b), henceforth referred to as P2, is not mirror symmetric about the $v=0$ axis. Besides the chaotic sea $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm C}$ at small velocities, it exhibits two additional chaotic layers at higher velocities: the upper layer $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm U}$ at $v \\gtrsim 2.2$ and the lower layer $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$ at $v \\lesssim -2.2$. The crucial point now is that the choice of an appropriate value for $\\gamma_V$ allows one to connect $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm C}$, asymmetrically, only with $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$ through a `cantorus' structure (red dashed line in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b) which is a hierarchical chain of stable and unstable fixed points, while it remains separated from $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm U}$ by a regular invariant curve (red solid line in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b). This allows particles to enter $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$ but not $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm U}$. This can be easily seen from the fixed time snapshot of the particle distribution onto P2 corresponding to case III denoted by the green dots in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b. These particles in  $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$ still move irregularly but now only in one direction through the lattice, which is the origin of the transport we observed in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}. The fact that the transport velocity does not quickly converge to a constant velocity, but accelerates very slowly, on time scales of $10^5$ driving periods towards its asymptotic value (case II in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}) is owed to the cantorus linking $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm C}$ and $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$, which effectively acts as a semi-permeable barrier to the particles approaching it and slows down the uniform filling of the accessible parts of the phase space. \n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Conversion between diffusive and ballistic motion} \nTo understand how switching the carrier lattice subsequently on and off allows to freeze, accelerate and revert the directed transport, we now analyse the \nimpact of lattice switches on the population of phase space structures (green dots in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a-c).\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig2}, case III, when we froze the directed transport by switching off the carrier lattice, the phase space changed suddenly from P2 to P1.\nThe crucial observation is now that particles located in $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$ of P2 at the instance of the lattice switch (green dots below $v\\sim -1.6$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b) are located in the regular domain of spanning curves in P1 (see Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a) after the switch. As usual, particles which are located on regular spanning curves after the switch (black lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}a), are confined to these structures and travel with almost constant velocity through the lattice. Hence, also the ensemble averaged velocity, i.e. the directed transport, remains approximately constant or `frozen' which explains our observation in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}, case III (the particles in the chaotic sea $\\mathcal{C}^1_{\\rm C}$ of P1 do not contribute to the transport as P1 is symmetric around $v=0$). In conclusion, the instantaneous switch of the dynamical system has caused a conversion from diffusive to regular motion for some particles, which is reminiscent to the conversion processes between regular and ballistic dynamics observed in driven superlattices \\cite{Wulf2012,Petri2011}.\n\nIt is now straightforward to see how switching the carrier lattice for a second time (case IV in Fig.~\\ref{fig2}) accelerates the transport again. This switch suddenly changes the underlying phase space from P1 to P2 and connects, again, $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm C}$ with $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$. Hence, since the particle density in $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm C}$ is (still) higher than the density in $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$ (Fig.~\\ref{fig3}b), particles continue penetrating through the cantorus into $\\mathcal{C}^2_{\\rm L}$ which stops only for a uniform particle distribution over the phase space. Furthermore, there is now a natural way to slow down the transport. Choosing an inverse phase difference of $\\phi=-\\pi/2$ (instead of $+\\pi/2$), mirrors P2 around $v=0$ and the particles now slowly redistribute from the central chaotic layer $\\mathcal{C}^3_{\\rm C}$ into the upper chaotic layer $\\mathcal{C}^3_{\\rm U}$ as shown in the PSOS P3 (black dots in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}c). This creates a `counterweight' to the particles in $\\mathcal{C}^3_{\\rm L}$ which slowly, but continuously grows (for a snapshot see green dots in Fig.~\\ref{fig3}c), which explains the observed decrease of the directed transport. \n\nHow long can we proceed to accelerate, slowdown and revert the transport?  The timescale is set by the uniform filling of the entire chaotic sea of P2. This limiting timescale depends crucially on the flux through the cantorus which in turn can be tuned by  varying the relative strengths of both lattices i.e. by changing $\\gamma_V$. For $\\gamma_V=1$ (the value we used), at about $t \\sim 4\\times 10^5T$ the entire chaotic sea of the two lattice setup (lower, central and upper sea) is uniformly filled with particles. At this point, no further modulation of the transport is possible within our scheme. \n\n\n\\paragraph{Experimental realization}\nWe believe that our dynamical control of directed currents can be realized in experimental setups using cold atoms in driven optical lattices where the periodic potential is generated by counterpropagating laser beams of perpendicular polarization \\cite{Schiavoni2003,Gommers2005,Wickenbrock2012,Renzoni2009}. The resulting lattice can be driven by phase modulation using acousto-optical modulators and radio frequency generators . Translating our parameters to experimentally relevant quantities for rubidium atoms, we obtain $V_S =V_C \\sim 0.197 E_r$, $\\omega \\sim \\omega_r$ and the product $dk\\sim \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $E_r$ and $\\omega_r$ are the recoil energy and recoil frequency of the atom respectively. In contrast to Brownian ratchets, our mechanism does not depend on noise and we explicitly checked that it is robust to noise of strengths in the regime typical for cold atom ratchet experiments \\cite{Cubero2010}. Beyond this typical regime, the enhanced particle flux through the cantori and other regular structures significantly decreases both the maximally achievable transport velocity and the operational timescale of our scheme.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Conclusions} \nWe provide a scheme offering the real-time control of directed currents in superimposed driven lattices. It can be straightforwardly implemented in ac-driven optical lattices and allows to design directed currents of cold thermal atomic ensembles which can be consecutively accelerated, slowed and reverted on demand. The mechanism underlying our scheme operates in phase space and depends only on large scale structures like the presence of different chaotic layers and cantori structures and should therefore be applicable more generally, e.g. as a design principle for targeted delivery of molecules or colloids in optical devices, or possibly on other vibrating substrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Acknowlegdements}\nB.L. gratefully acknowledges funding by a\nMarie Sk\\l{}odowska-Curie Intra European Fellowship (G.A. no 654908)\nwithin Horizon 2020.

A recent exception is \\cite{Arzola2011} which requires, however, dissipation and is restricted to `flipping' the directed current at fixed strength.\n\nHere, we exemplify a generic route towards the real-time control of directed currents. This allows not only to dynamically control both direction and strength of the transport, up to unusually high efficiencies, but also to freeze the transport velocity on demand.  \nUsing one non-transporting and symmetric oscillating lattice as a `substrate' for particles (Fig.~\\ref{fig1}, upper panel), we subsequently switch a second oscillating lattice, \ncalled the `carrier' lattice, \non and off. In particular, switching the carrier lattice on breaks the parity and time-reversal symmetries of our setup and induces a directed particle current (middle panel) \naccelerating the transport in a direction which can be\ncontrolled by the phase difference between the carrier and the substrate lattice. \nSwitching the carrier lattice off does not lead to a decay of the transport towards zero but `freezes' it at constant velocity (lower panel).\nThis can be repeated many times and allows one to design transport in real time. \nAs the underlying mechanism, we identify \na systematic opening and closing of cantorus structures, acting as barriers between transporting and non-transporting phase space structures upon switching.\nThereby, the timescale on which the current can be manipulated is set by the flux through the cantorus and we show that manipulations are, in fact, possible for up to $\\sim 10^5$\ndriving periods.\n\n\n\nOur scheme does not require noise, but is robust to it, and is designed for straightforward implementation with cold thermal atoms in \nsuperimposed driven optical lattices where state of the art technologies allow to avoid \ninterference terms between both lattices. Here, our scheme can be applied to guide atomic ensembles through optical lattices\non paths which can be designed in real time. The underlying working principle should be of more general relevance, for example, \nas a design principle for real time controlled targeted delivery of molecules or colloids in optical lattices or, possibly, also on other vibrated substrates. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.06]{fig_1.pdf}\n\\caption{\\small Schematic diagram of the setup and real time control of directed transport. \nUpper panel: Non-transporting state in the oscillating substrate lattice.
