Mott insulating phases in which \ncharge degrees of freedom are gapped have been argued to potentially host several families of quantum\nspin liquids ranging from Resonating Valence Bond $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids~\\cite{RokhsarKivelson1988,MoessnerSondhi2001,Ralko2005} to $U(1)$ algebraic spin liquids~\\cite{AffleckMarston1988,Ran2007,Corboz_honeycomb_2011}\nand chiral spin liquids~\\cite{Kalmeyer1987,Wen1989a,Wen1989b,Greiter2007,Messio2012,He2014,Gong2014,Bauer2014}. The topological properties of these phases have attracted a lot of attention due to \ntheir potential impact on the implementation of quantum computers\\cite{NayakRevModPhys.80.1083}. \n\nCold atoms open new perspectives in that respect. In particular, alkaline rare earths allow\nto realize $SU(N)$ Mott phases with $N$ as large as 10~\\cite{gorshkov2010,Scazza2014,Pagano2014,Zhang2014}, and if a chiral phase can be stabilized, its low-energy \ntheory is expected to be the $SU(N)$ level $k=1$ Chern-Simons theory. \nThe first proposal of a chiral phase in this context goes back to the work of Hermele et al \\cite{HermelePRL2009,HermeleGurarie2011}, \nwho showed that a mean-field approach leads to the stabilization of chiral\nphases on the square lattice in the limit of large $N$ and large number of particles per site $m$ with \n$N/m$ integer and $\\geq 5$. The same mean-field applied to $SU(6)$ on the honeycomb lattice with\none particle per site has also led to the prediction of a chiral state,  with a competing plaquette\nstate very close in energy \\cite{SzirmaiPRA2011}. More recently Ref.~\\cite{Chen2015} suggested the stabilization\nof $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquids on the square lattice using static synthetic gauge fields, based on a slave-rotor\nmean-field approach. In all theses cases, the results call for further investigation with methods that go\nbeyond mean-field theory. \n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Figs/EnergyPanel}\n\\caption{Panel (a): Ground state energy per site as a function of $\\theta$ for various $N$ and $N_s$.

We will discuss the experimental prospects of\nrealizing this Hamiltonian towards the end of the manuscript. It is interesting to note that parent Hamiltonians for $SU(N)$ chiral \nspin liquids have been proposed recently~\\cite{Tu2014328,Bondesan2014483}. They include both the two-site permutations and the\nimaginary part of the cyclic three-site permutations, but also in addition the real part of the cyclic three-site permutations, which\nwe omit. The range of the terms in the parent Hamiltonians are however not restricted to nearest neighbor or the elementary\ntriangular plaquette only, but the amplitudes depend in a power-law fashion on the distances among the two or three spins. While\nthere are some structural similarities, it is not obvious that the spatially compact Hamiltonian~\\eqref{eqn:Heisenberg} features CSL phases.  \nIt is the goal of this Letter to provide compelling numerical evidence, based on large-scale Exact Diagonalizations (ED) and Gutzwiller\nprojected parton wave functions, that the above Heisenberg Hamiltonian indeed features extended regions of $SU(N)$ CSLs for all\nvalues of $N=3$ to $9$ considered here.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Exact diagonalizations --} \n\n\nWe start by investigating finite periodic triangular lattice clusters as a function of $\\theta$ for\nvarious values of $N$.\nWe focus on the range $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi/2]$ in the following. $\\theta >\\pi/2$ is likely to be dominated\nby ferromagnetism, while $\\theta<0$ yields the time-reversed, but otherwise identical physics as $-\\theta$. \nFor small values of $N=3,4$ we used the standard ED approach employing\nall the space group symmetries, while only considering the individual color conservation, corresponding to an abelian subgroup of $SU(N)$.\nFor all other $N$ a recently developed ED approach by two of the authors~\\cite{NatafMilaPRL2014}, exploiting the $SU(N)$ symmetry at the expense of spatial symmetries,\nis currently the only way to address these systems within ED. Depending on $N$, the largest system sizes $N_s$ range from 21 to 27 lattice sites.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:energy_spectra}(a) we plot the ED results for the energy per site of the ground state as a function of $\\theta$ for all considered $N$ (open symbols). While the\ncurves for $N\\lesssim 5$ look rather smooth at first sight, it is visible that the energy per site displays kinks around $\\theta/\\pi\\sim 0.05-0.1$ and at\n$\\theta/\\pi\\sim 0.35-0.4$ for $N=6$ to $9$. For comparison we plot the energy expectation value of parameter-free Gutzwiller projected \nchiral spin liquid model wave functions for all values of $N$ (full lines). We will discuss the properties of these wave functions in a moment.\nInterestingly, these model wave functions have very competitive energies, especially in the $\\theta$ region slightly above the first kink. \nFor a quantitative comparison we show in Fig.~\\ref{fig:energy_spectra}(b) the ratio of the variational energy divided by the ED ground state \nenergy. It is impressive that for $N$ beyond 3 the best ratio exceeds $0.98$ for the system sizes considered. So the picture so far is that the\nsmall and large $\\theta$ regimes for all considered $N$ are most likely other phases, while the intermediate region could harbour chiral spin liquids. \n\n$SU(N)$ chiral spin liquids are intrinsically topologically ordered: They exhibit a non-trivial ground state degeneracy on the torus~\\cite{HermeleGurarie2011}\nand fractional excitations. The ground state degeneracy on the torus is expected to be $N$ for these particular states \nwith $N$ different abelian anyons~\\cite{HermelePRL2009,HermeleGurarie2011}. In our numerical simulations, we can detect this degeneracy by investigating\nthe low-energy spectrum on samples with a total number of lattice sites $N_s$ that is an integer multiple of $N$. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:energy_spectra}(c) we display\nthe energy spread $\\Delta_\\mathrm{GS}$ of these $N$ expected ground states for different $N$ as a function of $\\theta$. As a general trend we observe that the splitting reduces \nsignificantly as we increase $N$. On the other hand several samples still show a substantial splitting. Naively one would expect a simple exponential suppression\nof the splitting with system size, however in the related context of fractional Chern insulators a more subtle dependence of the ground space splitting \non the actual shape of the clusters has been observed and rationalized~\\cite{AML_FCI_2013}. We think that similar considerations apply here as well.\n\nFinally we also measure the gap $\\Delta_\\mathrm{singlet}$ from the absolute ground state to the first singlet level that is not part of the expected ground state \nmanifold. This is a measure for the excitation gap in the gapped chiral spin liquid states. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:energy_spectra}(d), one observes an approximate dome-shaped\nbehaviour of this gap for all $N$, and furthermore this gap seems to depend only weakly on $N$. The approximate region in $\\theta$ where the $N$-fold \nground state degeneracy splitting is small compared to the excitation gap (for large $N$) is indicated as a shaded region in all the panels, and indicates a rough \nstability region for the $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquids on the triangular lattice. One should note however that the precise extent of the chiral spin liquids for small $N$ is an open question at this point.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Variational~parton~approach --}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\linewidth]{Figs/VMC_GS_degeneracy}}\n\\caption{VMC ground space degeneracy: ordered sequence of eigenvalues of the overlap\nmatrix of Gutzwiller projected wave functions with 30 different values of threaded flux. \nThe overlap matrix has precisely $N$ large eigenvalues for an $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquid.}\n\\label{fig:vmc_subspace}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nAn appealing way to describe the $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquids is to use a parton-based mean field approach~\\cite{Baskaran1987973,baskaran1988gauge,PhysRevB.38.745,PhysRevB.38.2926,PhysRevLett.76.503,senthil2000z,HermelePRL2009,HermeleGurarie2011}, complemented\nwith a Gutzwiller projection. The idea is to fractionalize the elementary spin degree\nof freedom into fermionic spinons (partons) with $N$ flavors. For an exact description a dynamical gauge field needs to enforce the physical constraint\nof one fermion per site. At the mean-field level however it is sufficient to specify the band structure and filling of the fermionic spinons.\nIn the $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquids of interest here, the spinon band structure consists of $N$ bands, where the lowest band is completely filled for all \n$N$ flavors and separated by a gap from the other bands. In addition this band is required to have Chern number $\\pm1$. For the triangular lattice \nwe use a Hofstadter-type tight-binding Hamiltonian with a uniform flux of $\\pi/N$ per triangular plaquette~\\footnote{Note that at this stage the flux per \nplaquette is unrelated to the flux per plaquette in the original Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian~\\eqref{eqn:Hubbard}}, fulfilling the requirements on the band\nstructure. This mean-field state can now be turned into a valid spin wave function by the application of an exact Gutzwiller projection, enforcing the \npresence of exactly one fermionic spinon per site. Such a wave function can be handled by Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques, and in particular\none can easily calculate the energy of the Hamiltonian~\\eqref{eqn:Heisenberg} on rather large lattices. The VMC energies displayed in \nFig.~\\ref{fig:energy_spectra}(a),(b) have been obtained this way. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\linewidth]{Figs/Overlaps_SU_3_N_12}}\n\\caption{Summed squared overlaps of the VMC model wave functions with ED eigenstates for $N=3$ and $N_s=12$. The\nblue crossed denote ED eigenstates, while the diameter of the filled red circles denotes the total squared overlap on those\neigenstates. In the best case the summed overlaps on the lowest three ED eigenstates (degeneracy $1+2$) account for over 90\\% of the total weight.}\n\\label{fig:overlap_vmc_ed}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe next question is how the VMC approach is able to account for the non-trivial ground\nstate degeneracy on the torus.  It turns out that by threading flux through the non-contractible loops around the torus, \none is able to span an $N$-dimensional subspace of Gutzwiller projected wave-functions, with almost identical local properties on finite\nlattices. From the viewpoint of topological order this corresponds to a charge pumping procedure, where one cycles through the $N$ different ground states\nby threading different anyonic flux through the interior of the torus. These concepts have recently been explored in the context of $SU(2)$ CSL on several\nlattices~\\cite{PhysRevB.84.075128,Tu2013,WietekLaeuchli2015}. We have checked in Fig.~\\ref{fig:vmc_subspace} that the subspace of wave functions \nspanned by using $30$ different boundary conditions at the mean-field level leads to a robust rank-$N$ overlap matrix, therefore corroborating the expectation\nof an $N$-fold degenerate ground state manifold in the thermodynamic limit also at the VMC level.\n\nSince the variational energies for $SU(3)$ turned out not to be very competitive, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:energy_spectra}(a)/(b),\nwe explicitly calculated the overlaps of individual ED eigenstates of the Hamiltonian~\\eqref{eqn:Heisenberg} with the three orthogonal\nGutzwiller wave functions obtained on the same system size. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:overlap_vmc_ed}  we plot the summed squared overlap of all three wave functions \n(diameter of filled circles) with the ED eigenstates (crosses) as a function of $\\theta$. Here we consider a $N_s=12$ site system, where the\nmomenta of the three ED ground states in the chiral spin liquid phase are at the zone center (one) and at the corners of the Brillouin zone (twofold degenerate). Around $\\theta=0$\nthe SU(3) triangular lattice Heisenberg model is in a three-sublattice flavor ordered state~\\cite{Lauchli2006,Bauer2012}, however in the region around $\\theta/\\pi\\sim 0.25$, the three lowest ED eigenstates indeed have sizeable overlap with the VMC model wave functions, thereby underlining the presence of an\n$SU(3)$ chiral spin liquid for sufficiently large values of $\\theta$ also for $N=3$.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Figs/EdgeModesPanel}\n\\caption{Edge states in  $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquids: the leftmost panel displays the $N_s=19$ sites triangular cluster with\nopen boundary conditions used. In the various other panels we exhibit the low energy spectrum as a function of the angular momentum around\nthe central site ($\\l_0$ denotes the ground state angular momentum). The chiral edge states are clearly visible, with a characteristic $SU(N)$\nmultiplet structure, which corresponds to a particular sector of a chiral $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten conformal field theory.\nThe analytical predictions are indicated by the dimensions of the $SU(N)$ multiplets and can be found in Tab.~\\ref{tab:counting_sun_1_Ns_19} of\nthe supplementary material.}\n\\label{fig:edge_spectra}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Edge states --}\n\nAnother hallmark of chiral topological phases is the presence of chiral edge modes in the energy spectrum of systems with a boundary.\nIt has been understood that the characteristic energy level structure of the edge excitations as a function of the momentum along the \nboundary serves as a fingerprint of the type of topological order realised in the bulk~\\cite{Wen2004}. The $SU(N)$\nCSLs considered here are expected to exhibit a chiral edge energy spectrum described by the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) \nconformal field theory (CFT)~\\cite{HermeleGurarie2011}. This is the same CFT that governs the low-energy spectrum of well-studied \none-dimensional critical $SU(N)$ spin chains~\\cite{Sutherland1975,Affleck1986409,Tu2014328,Bondesan2014483}. \n\nIn order to test this hypothesis numerically, one has to design a setup where one can detect the edge modes in a clean way. Starting from a torus\na natural way would be to cut the torus open into a cylinder. This geometry however has two independent, counter-propagating edges, making\na clean analysis difficult, given the system sizes $N_s$ accessible to ED. We therefore choose to emulate a disk geometry by considering the\nspecific $N_s=19$ site triangular lattice with open boundary conditions depicted in the left panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:edge_spectra}. Such a lattice might\nactually be built in future ultracold atom experiments with optical lattices and a tight confining potential. This sample still has a sixfold rotation axis \nabout the central site, yielding an angular momentum quantum number which we use to plot the energy spectrum. The energy spectrum of the disc \nhas no topological ground state degeneracy,\nbut features gapless edge modes which typically propagate only in one direction. The precise multiplet structure of the edge modes depends on the\nanyonic sector. In our setup this sector can be simply labeled as $a=(N_s\\mod{N})$. In Tab.~\\ref{tab:counting_sun_1_Ns_19} of the supplementary material\nwe have compiled \nthe $SU(N)_1$ WZNW CFT predictions for the different irreducible representations of $SU(N)$ which appear at a given excitation energy, here qualitatively\nlabeled by the excess angular momentum $l-l_0$. In the remaining panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:edge_spectra} we display the actual ED energy spectrum of the\nHamiltonian~\\eqref{eqn:Heisenberg} for a fixed value of $\\theta/\\pi=0.25$ for $N=3$ up to $8$ as a function of the angular momentum $l-l_0$. For\nall $N$ one can clearly identify a branch of chiral excitations propagating to the right. The analytical predictions are indicated by the dimensions of the\n$SU(N)$ irreducible representations. For all $N$ the numerical data for the first three sectors ($l-l_0=0,1,2$) is in full agreement with the analytical \npredictions. The splitting between the multiplets at a given value of $l$ is expected to vanish as $N_s$ grows, and the spectrum should become linear \nwith a certain edge state velocity. In summary the analysis of the structure of the edge excitations performed here confirms the $SU(N)_1$ WZNW CFT predictions\nand thus strengthens the case for abelian $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquids in the model Hamiltonian~\\eqref{eqn:Heisenberg}.\n\n\\paragraph{Experimental considerations --}\nWith the recent realization of the Mott-crossover regime in 3D optical lattices with fermionic Ytterbium atoms~\\cite{Taie2012,Hofrichter2015}\nthe prospect for the realization of strongly correlated $SU(N)$ quantum magnetism is becoming bright. Our proposal for triangular lattices\nbuilds on ingredients which have been demonstrated separately: the possibility to realize Mott insulators in optical lattices, and to create static artificial gauge \nfields in an optical lattice (for alkaline atoms)~\\cite{PhysRevLett.111.185301,PhysRevLett.111.185302}. Beside, working with the triangular lattice is a big advantage because the 3-site permutation term is the first and only term to appear to third order perturbation theory starting from the Hubbard model with one particle per site, by contrast to e.g. the square and honeycomb\nlattice, where they appear at order 4 and 6 respectively, and are not the first corrections. The chiral phase typically appears for \n$\\theta \\simeq 0.3$, which, using the perturbation expressions of $J=2t^2/U$ and $K_3=6t^3/U^2$, corresponds to $t/U \\simeq 0.1$. This \nmight be small enough to be still in the Mott insulating phase, and to ensure that higher order corrections are negligible. In future studies one\nmight also relax the $\\pi/2$ flux per plaquette condition, and explore the extent of the expected stability region of the $SU(N)$ CSL phases.\n\nSeveral interesting questions need to be addressed in future work. For example, is it possible to directly engineer the required three\nsite exchange terms in Hamiltonian~\\eqref{eqn:Heisenberg} using sophisticated quantum optics schemes? There is hope that the\ncurrent activity on lattice gauge-theory implementations will bring techniques to address this question. Another intriguing question regards\nthe detection of $SU(N)$ chiral spin liquid edge states in actual experiments, for example using spectroscopic techniques for small droplets,\nor braiding protocols for the abelian anyons~\\cite{HermeleGurarie2011}.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}  \nThe authors acknowledge P.~Corboz, M.~Hermele, T.~Quella, A.~Sterdyniak, H.-H.~Tu and Hongyu Yang for useful discussions.

The primary field for each $N$ is dictated by the open boundary clusters size $N_s=19$ \nvia the length $(N_s \\mod N)$ of the single-column young diagram at $l=0$. We have derived these results using\na successive $SU(N)$ coupling sequence with the adjoint representation starting from the irreducible representation at $l=0$ \nand subsequent the null-vector elimination based on the $SU(N)$ counting rule restrictions listed in Tab.~\\ref{tab:counting}.\nThis simplified procedure uses the fact that the $SU(N)_1$ CFT can also be seen as particular $SU(N)$ invariant combination \nof $N-1$ Luttinger liquid CFTs (thus the $SU(N)_1$ WZNW CFT central charge $c=N-1$).\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}[b]\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nSU(N) &  counting rule & OEIS identifier\\\\\n\\hline\n\\hline\nSU(2) & $1, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$  &\\href{https://oeis.org/A000041}{A000041}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(3) &  $1, 2, 5, 10, \\ldots$ &\\href{https://oeis.org/A000712}{A000712}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(4) & $1, 3, 9, 22, \\ldots$ &\\href{https://oeis.org/A000716}{A000716}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(5) & $1, 4, 14, 40, \\ldots$ &\\href{https://oeis.org/A023003}{A023003}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(6) & $1, 5, 20, 65, \\ldots$ &\\href{https://oeis.org/A023004}{A023004}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(7) & $1, 6, 27,98, \\ldots$ &\\href{https://oeis.org/A023005}{A023005}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(8) & $1, 7, 35, 140,\\ldots$ &\\href{https://oeis.org/A023006}{A023006}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(9) & $1, 8, 44, 192,\\ldots$ &\\href{https://oeis.org/A023007}{A023007}\\\\\n\\hline\nSU(10)&$1, 9, 54, 255,\\ldots$&\\href{https://oeis.org/A023008}{A023008}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{$SU(N)$ counting rules used to derive the results in Tab.~\\ref{tab:counting_sun_1_Ns_19}.}\n\\label{tab:counting}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 5728, "prevtext": "\nwhere the phases $\\phi_{ij}$ are chosen in a such a way that the (gauge-invariant) flux through each\ntriangular plaquette is equal to $\\pi/2$.
