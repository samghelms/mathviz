In this expression, $\\Lambda$ is a cutoff energy, which is typically the band width of the Landau band; $a$ and $c$ are the lattice parameters and $g$ is the electron-electron interaction strength, which is estimated to be $1 \\sim 2$ eV.\nThe Fermi wave vector along $c$-axis $k_{F}=\\sqrt{\\frac{A_{F}}{\\pi}}$ and the Fermi velocity $v_{F}$ are estimated as $0.017$~{\\AA}$^{-1}$ and $1.31 \\times 10^{5}$ m/s respectively by the analysis of the SdH oscillations.\nThe characteristic magnetic field $B^{*}=(\\frac{\\hbar}{e}) \\frac{\\hbar v_{F}}{ga^{2}c}$ from Eq.(\\ref{CDW}) is estimated as $\\sim 195 - 390 $ T.\nThis estimation is consistent with $B^{*} \\sim 220$ T from the linear fit on the experimental data when $\\Lambda \\sim 10^4$ K.\n\nIn this expression, $T_{C}$ exponentially decays when $B\\ll B^{*} $.\nAs shown in Fig. 4 Panel (B), both temperatures for $\\beta$ and $\\beta'$ deviate from a linear relationship between $ln T_{\\beta}$, $ln T_{\\beta'}$ and the inverse magnetic field.\nThe linear relationship of $ln(T_{C})$ vs. $1/\\mu_{0}H$ was reported in pristine graphite, while for neutron-irradiated graphite the relation deviates from linearity which is similar as that for $\\beta$ or $\\beta'$ \\cite{Iye-graphite-impurity, Tokunaga-graphite-excitonic}.\nIn neutron-irradiated graphite, the deviation is due to the pairing breaking effect by the charged impurities of the lattice defects which significantly affect its $T_{C}$.\nTaAs has much more complicated band structure including two different types of pockets near the Weyl points and one trivial hole pocket.\nThe effect of the trivial hole pocket on the change of $ \\rho _{zz}$ is not clear, but we anticipate that $ \\rho _{zz}$ will not show a strongly insulating behavior due to the existence of trivial hole conducting channel.\nFuture experiments such as Nernst signal and magnetic torque measurements in a strong magnetic field will help to elaborate the instabilities for $\\alpha $ and $\\beta$.\n\n\nFinally we show that the most plausible instability happening in TaAs is the SDW transitions with the nesting vector {\\bf Q} between the two Weyl pockets with opposite chirality.\nIf the screened Coulomb interaction is responsible for the instability, the interaction should be stronger at smaller nesting vector.\nAccording to the previous band structure calculations and ARPES measurements, the nesting within each pair of Weyl points has the shortest distance from each other in the momentum space.\nAs shown in Fig. 1 (A), for a pair of W1 near the Brillouin zone boundary located at $(k_{0x}, \\pm k_{0y}, 0)$, the nesting vector {\\bf Q} equals $(0, 2k_{0y}, 0)$ where $k_{0y} = 0.014\\pi/a $ if W1 is initially located at the Fermi level ~\\cite{Weng-TaAs}.\nIn our samples whose Fermi level is away from the Weyl points, the Fermi points of the zeroth Landau level are shifted to $(k_{0x},\\pm\nk_{0y},\\pm k_{0z})$, where $k_{0z}$ can be estimated from the SdH oscillation as $k_{0z}\\approx 0.2\\pi/c$, assuming that the chemical potential is fixed.\nThe nesting vector is given by ${\\bf Q}=(0,2k_{0y},2k_{0z})\\approx (0, 0.03\\pi/a, 0.2\\pi/c)$.\nDue to the opposite spin quantum numbers at the two Fermi points, the instability will generates (see SI) a helical spin density wave ~\\cite{WangZhong-Weyl-helix}.\nThe cases of other three pairs of W1 Weyl points are similar.\nThe same analysis is also applicable to the W2 Weyl points, whose instability generates helical spin density waves of different forms\n(see SI).\nFrom our transport data at hand, it is difficult to distinguish the W1 instability from the W2 instability, and other experimental\ntools such as spin-resolved STM may be useful in further investigations.\n\nIn summary, we observed anomalies in the electrical transport properties for TaAs in its ultraquantum region.\nThese strongly temperature-dependent anomalies suggest the signs of the instability of Weyl electrons.\nThe helical SDWs between the pairs of the Weyl electron pockets with opposite chiralities are the most plausible instability.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nWe would like to thank Fa Wang, Haiwen Liu and

Weyl semimetal TaAs in an intense magnetic field.\nSeries of anomalies occur in the longitudinal magnetoresistance and Hall signals at ultra-low temperatures when the Weyl electrons are confined into the lowest Landau level.\nThese strongly temperature-dependent anomalies are ascribed to the electron-hole pairing instability.\nOur measurements show that the Weyl semimetal TaAs in the ultraquantum regime provides a good platform for studying electron-electron interaction in topological nontrivial  semimetals.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nA Weyl semimetal (WSM) is a novel topological material whose low energy excited states host the quasiparticles which obey the Hamiltonian for Weyl fermions \\cite{Balents-Weyl, Qi-Weyl}.\nA WSM provides a unique opportunity for studying the Weyl fermions which are well-known in particle physics literature but have not been observed as fundamental particles in nature.\nWeyl semimetals can be realized by breaking a time-reversal symmetry for Dirac semimetals in a magnetic environment, but the semimetals without an inversion center on crystal lattices are possible to host Weyl nodes as well \\cite{Wan-Weyl-2011, Burkov-multiWeyl}.\nFor the type of inversion symmetry breaking Weyl semimetals, the Weyl nodes are the crossing points of a spin-splitted bulk band in momentum space. Weyl fermions appear as quasiparticles of their low-energy excitations near the nodes.\nRecently, the first non-magnetic, non-central symmetric WSM tantalum mono-arsenide (TaAs) has been verified in experiments ~\\cite{huang_weyl_2015, Weng-TaAs, Xu-TaAs-Weyl, DingHong-TaAs}.\nAngle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments for TaAs observed Fermi arcs in its surface electronic states which connect the bulk Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities~\\cite{Xu-TaAs-Weyl, DingHong-TaAs}.\nElectrical transport measurements in low magnetic fields detected negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) which is ascribed to the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly between the pairs of Weyl nodes ~\\cite{Spivak-ABJ, 2015arXiv150302630Z, Chen-Chiral-TaAs}.\nSingle crystals of TaAs also exhibit ultra-high carrier mobilities and extremely large, linear transversal MR \\cite{2015arXiv150200251Z, Chen-Chiral-TaAs}.\nAll these experimental and theoretical studies on the isostructural family of TaAs open up a new area for the research of topological materials.\n\nIn this paper we focus on the electrical transport properties for TaAs in an intense magnetic field ($B$ or $\\mu_{0} H$).\nFor a semimetal with small electron and hole pockets, a strong magnetic field beyond the quantum limit (QL) confines the electrons into the lowest Landau level (LLL) ~\\cite{Halperin_QL, Yakovenko-QL, Behnia-graphite-express}.\nThe LLL for a WSM possesses two linear dispersive subbands which are separated in the momentum space.\nWhen an electric field is applied in the same direction as the magnetic field in this extremity, the charge in each chiral Landau subband is not conserved and chiral anomaly occurs \\cite{NielsenABJ, Gorbar-Chiral, Burkov-Weyl-2012, Qi-Weyl}.\nIf the electron interaction induced phases are not considered, a positive longitudinal magneto-conductivity will occur due to the charge pumping effect between the Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities \\cite{NielsenABJ, Qi-Weyl}.\nHowever, a three-dimensional electron system in its LLL exhibits one-dimensional metal characteristic effects \\cite{Halperin_QL, Yakovenko-QL}.\nAny small interactions will easily induce instabilities of the electrons in such highly degenerate states.\nDifferent types of instabilities in strong magnetic fields have been observed in topologically trivial semimetals \\cite{Behnia-graphite-express, Behnia-Bi-Science, Li-Bi-Science}.\nThe examples include charge density wave (CDW) -like phase transitions and excitonic phases in graphite \\cite{Iye-graphite-PRB1982, Yoshioka-graphite-1981, Behnia-graphite-longitudinal,Singleton-graphite, Goto-graphite-1998}.\nElectron interaction induced CDW, spin density wave (SDW), and excitonic phases are predicted for Weyl semimetals in theory as well, but the magnetic catalytic phase transitions were less considered \\cite{WangZhong-axion,Aji-Weyl-excitonic, Aji-Weyl-PRB2014, Sau-Weyl-QL, RanYing-iridate, WangZhong-Weyl-helix}.\nThe experiments for the WSM TaAs family are rarely reported in a magnetic field stronger than that in superconducting magnets \\cite{shekhar_NbP_2015, 2015arXiv150706301Z}.\nAll the referred complexity motivates us to study the electrical transport properties of the WSM TaAs beyond its QL.\n\nBand structure calculations and ARPES experiments confirmed that TaAs has two types of Weyl nodes, four pairs of Weyl nodes-1 (W1) on $k_z$ = 2$\\pi$/$c$ ($c$ is the lattice constant) plane and the other eight pairs of Weyl nodes-2 (W2) that are away from this plane \\cite{huang_weyl_2015, Weng-TaAs, Xu-TaAs-Weyl, DingHong-TaAs}.\nIn relation to the other three members (NbAs, NbP and TaP) in the isostructural family \\cite{Luo-NbAs-PRB, TaPZhanglowfield}, the single crystals of TaAs grown in our lab in general have smaller Weyl electron pockets with the minimal cross section area less than 10 Tesla (T).\nThe anisotropic Weyl electron pockets close to W1 have the minimal cross section area along the crystallographic $c$ direction, which is three times smaller than that along the $a$ direction.\nAccording to the band structure calculations and ARPES experiments, there also exists trivial pockets which have $2\\sim 5$ times larger extremal cross section area than that of the pockets near W1 and W2 \\cite{huang_weyl_2015, Xu-TaAs-Weyl}.\nThe proper chemical potentials for the samples of TaAs provide small enough Fermi pockets which are convenient for exclusively exploring the Weyl electrons' behaviors beyond the QL.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{TaAs_arxiv_FIG1.eps}\n \\caption{(Color online) (A): a schematic for the projection of all the Weyl points on the $(001)$ surface of Brillouin zone for TaAs.
