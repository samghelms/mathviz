Wilson suggested that \nstrong electric fields in thunderclouds might \naccelerate free electrons present in the atmosphere\nto high energies\\cite{Wilson1924}. \n\n\nSince then, radiation associated with thunderstorms \nattracted the interest \nas natural particle-acceleration process\nand many experiments have been attempted \nto detect these radiations in various environments.\n\nFor instance, bursts of $\\gamma$-rays were observed on orbiting satellites with energy up to tens of MeV\nand with duration of less than 1 ms.\nThey are called Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes(TGF's)\\cite{TGF}. \n\nRecently, Dwyer {\\it et al.}~\\cite{Dwyer2015} reported unexpected observation of \npositron bursts, lasting about 0.2\\, s,\nby an airborne detector when the aeroplane flew into a thundercloud.\n\nOn the other hand, $\\gamma$-ray flux enhancements of longer duration of order 100 s\nwere reported in limited environments like high mountains~\\cite{Suszcynsky1996, Brunetti2000, Chubenko2000,\nChubenko2003, Alexeenko2002, Torii2009, Tsuchiya2009, Tsuchiya2012, Chilingarian2010, Chilingarian2012} and  sea level locations in the coastal area of the Japan Sea.\nThey are also called Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements(TGE's)~\\cite{Chilingarian2012}.\nJapanese groups found that \nradiation monitoring posts or dedicated scintillation counters in and near nuclear power plants signaled \nan increase of $\\gamma$-ray dose \nwhich seemed to originate from low altitude winter thunderclouds\\cite{Yamazaki2002,Torii2002,Enoto2007,Tsuchiya2007,Tsuchiya2011,Tsuchiya2013}.\nEspecially, Torii {\\it et al.}~\\cite{Torii2011} found that area of $\\gamma$-ray flux enhancements\nwas moving as the associated thundercloud passed across the observation site.\n\nGurevich {\\it et al.}~\\cite{Gurevich1992,Gurevich2005} developed\nthe runaway electron model to explain the electron acceleration \nin the electric field of the thunderclouds.\nThe stopping power of air for electrons decreases with increasing electron energy and goes up again by relativistic effects.\nTherefore, electric field in the thundercloud may accelerate electrons if the the electric force is larger than the minimum stopping power and\nthe electron energy is in the region where the electric force exceeds the stopping power.  \nSuch electrons are called runaway electrons. \nBy generating knock-on electrons successively, the runaway electrons can cause an avalanche multiplication process called\nrelativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA).\n\nNumerical simulations\\cite{Torii2004a, Babich2010a, DwyerPR2014} \nwith models of thundercloud electric field\nsuggested that the avalanche can be produced \ncontinuously \nif energetic seed electrons are provided, for example, by cosmic ray secondaries.\nA significant flux of relativistic runaway electrons in the lower parts of thunderclouds\nis capable of producing intensive bremsstrahlung which can reach the\nEarth's surface or the mountain top to account for the observed flux enhancement.\n\nRecently, the neutron bursts associated with thunderstorms were\nalso observed in various experiments~\\cite{Shyam1999,Chilingarian2010,Martin2010,Gurevich2012,Starodubtsev2012}.\nThe generation of neutrons is most probably by photoproduction by $\\gamma$-rays with\nair nuclei as the detected $\\gamma$ ray spectrum extends \nabove the photonuclear reaction threshold for nitrogen ($\\sim 10.5 {\\rm MeV}$)~\\cite{Babich2010}.\nIt may have a significant effect on \n${}^{14}{\\rm C}$ dating~\\cite{Libby1973,Fleischer1974} through the neutron capture reaction\n${}^{14}{\\rm N}(n,p) {}^{14}{\\rm C}$.\n\nOur research group have developed prototypes of \na reactor neutrino detector ``PANDA'',\nwhich stands for Plastic Anti-Neutrino Detector Array~\\cite{LesserPANDA,PANDA36}.\nWe have originally targeted PANDA at presenting\nthe feasibility of reactor monitoring using neutrinos\nwith a tonne-size detector.\n$\\gamma$-rays and neutrons can also be detected by PANDA by Compton scattering\nand the delayed coincidence of proton recoil and neutron captures.\nWe installed the PANDA detector \noutside of the reactor building of Ohi power station, which stands near the Japan Sea in Fukui,\nand tried to watch the reactor operating status\nvia detecting and analyzing the anti-electron neutrinos produced in the reactor core.\n\nWe accidentally found that\nthere were intensive increases of $\\gamma$-ray flux\ncorrelated with the winter thunder-storm activity\nduring the measurement.\nIn this paper, we report the\ninvestigated properties of these burst events\ntaking advantages of the unprecedented features of the detector\nincluding high statistics, good energy response,\ndirection sensitivity and neutron identification.\n\n\\section{Experimental setup}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur prototype detector ``PANDA36'' consists of thirty-six (six by six) stacked modules~\\cite{LesserPANDA,PANDA36}.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe module was made of \na plastic scintillator bar($10 {\\rm cm} \\times 10 {\\rm cm} \\times 100 {\\rm cm}$) with effective mass of about 10kg wrapped \nwith aluminized Mylar films and gadolinium (Gd) coated Mylar films (4.9 mg of Gd per ${\\rm cm}^2$).\nEach bar was connected to acrylic light guides and photomultipliers on \nboth ends (Figure~\\ref{fig:PANDA_module}).\n\n\n\nThe light intensity ratio seen by each PMT pair allows one \nto estimate the position of the hit along the module~\\cite{LesserPANDA}.\nUsing the position of the hit and the charge outputs from each PMT,\none can estimate the energy deposit of the hit.\nThe position and energy resolutions\nwere 16\\,cm and 300\\,keV for\n4\\,MeV hit on the center, respectively.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{figures/PANDA-module.eps}\n    \\caption{Structure of the PANDA module}\n    \\label{fig:PANDA_module}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nEach PMT signal was divided into two:\nabout $15\\%$ of the original charge was sent\nto CAEN V792 multi-event Charge-to-Digital-Converters (QDCs)\nand the other $85\\%$ was passed to\nCAEN V895 leading edge discriminators.\n\nThe discriminator outputs were sent to CAEN V1495 general purpose VME board,\nwhich has customizable FPGA unit (Altera Cyclone EP1C20).\n\nThe logic counted the number of pairs of fired PMTs seeing the same scintillator.\nWhenever the number of the pairs was greater than\nor equal to two, the logic generated the gate pulses of 400\\,ns duration\nfor the QDCs.\n\nThe timing of the gate pulses and busy signals from the QDCs were\nrecorded by the same FPGA.\nWe used these time stamps to select neutrino events \nby delayed coincidence method offline.\n\nThe PANDA36 detector was loaded on and transported by a 2-tonne dry van.\nThe detector was deployed beside the Unit 2 of Ohi Power Station \n($35^{\\circ}32'32''{\\rm N}, 135^{\\circ}39'14''{\\rm E}$\nand about 10~m above the sea level)\nof Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc on November 18th, 2011.\nWe continued the measurement for 62 days.\n\nEnergy calibrations were carried out before the deployment using the Compton edge of  $^{60}$Co $\\gamma$-rays.\nTime drifting of gains of each PMT and QDC was corrected using the peak of through-going cosmic muons in the spectrum of the events.\n\n\n\n\\section{Event-rate increase}\n\nIn the data acquired \nby the PANDA36 detector through the neutrino detection experiment,\nwe found unexpected increases of event rate.\nThe trigger rate got twice or higher for a few minutes\nfor the events with total energy deposit larger than 3\\,MeV\nindependently of the reactor operation.\n\nTemporal variation of the event rate are shown in \nFigure~\\ref{fig:eventrates}.\nBurst duration is defined as an interval whose event rates are\n5$\\sigma$ greater than average event rate.\nThe date and time, duration and peak event rate are summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:features}.\nWe hereafter call each burst by the name defined in the table.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n    \n    \\mbox{\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figures/burst20111225-eventrate.large.eps}}\n    \\mbox{\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figures/burst20120102-eventrate.large.eps}}\n    \\mbox{\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figures/burst20120105-eventrate.large.eps}}\n    \\caption{Temporal variation of the event rates of three bursts}\n    \\label{fig:eventrates}\n\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe searched for the association between thunderclouds and the radiation bursts\nvia ``Kaminari Nowcast'' data provided by Japan Meteorological Agency.\nKaminari Nowcast provides the thunder activity information\nanalyzed from lightning discharges detected by Lightning Detection Network System (LIDEN) and\nradar observations for every $\\sim1\\,{\\rm km}$ grid~\\cite{JapanMeteorologicalAgency}.\n\nKaminari Nowcast data show that there were more than one grid \nwhich have level 2 thunder activity of five levels around the experimental site for all three bursts\nat almost the same time that the radiation bursts have been observed.\n\n\nConversly, we found 22 time-consecutive data sets of level 2 or higher \nin 20 $\\times$ 20 grids around the detector.\nNevertheless, radiation bursts are observed only three times.\nIt is not strange since the $\\gamma$-ray emitting region is conceivably much smaller than the above area.\n\n\n\\section{The energy and the height of the source electrons}\\label{sec:source}\n\nWe performed Monte Carlo simulations to estimate\nthe energy and the height of the source electrons using Geant4 toolkit~\\cite{Agostinelli2003},\nassuming the $\\gamma$-rays are caused by high energy electrons emitted downwards from\nthunderclouds.\n\nAt first, \nwe simulated the numbers and spectra of bremsstrahlung photons at the ground level\ninitiated by mono-energetic electrons projected vertically downward from the sky.\nThe height and energy of the source electrons were chosen to be combinations of\n100\\,m, 500\\,m, 900\\,m, 1300\\,m,\nand 17\\,MeV, 23\\,MeV, 29\\,MeV, 35\\,MeV.\nAs a generic spectral shape of the source electrons,\nwe estimated it as a sum of these four components.\nLower-energy electron components were ignored \nfor the moment since they would be inappropriate to the\nquantitative discussion.\n\n\n\nIt does not necessarily exclude the theoretically expected exponential electron energy distribution~\\cite{Dwyer2011}.  Lower-energy components of electrons, if exist, are less efficient in producing bremsstrahlung $\\gamma$-rays on the ground, and therefore flux of those lower-energy electrons could only be determined with poor accuracy.\n\nThen we calculated the detector response to those $\\gamma$-rays.\nNext, we calculated the weighted sum of the spectra of the detector responses\nto the simulated bremsstrahlung $\\gamma$-rays from four energies of electrons\nprojected from each height. \n\nThe summed spectra were compared with the observed spectra of the bursts\nafter background subtraction.\nThe background data were taken in two ten-minute intervals\nstarting\nthirteen minutes before and three minutes after the burst periods.\nIt is seen that the observed spectra extend up to 15 MeV or more.\nWe fitted the weights to minimize the $\\chi^2$\nfor each projection height.\nThe analyses were done for all the three bursts and the \nfit results with the heights and the weights\nwhich minimize $\\chi^2$ are shown in \nFigure\\,\\ref{fig:bremss_spectrum}.\nAlthough we have ignored the lower-energy electrons,\nthe fittings yielded reasonable $\\chi^2/\\mathrm{d.o.f}$ values,\nwhich are 1.080, 1.208 and 1.093, for burst-20111225, burst-20120102\nand burst-20120105, respectively.\nThe source electron spectra with the weights at the projection heights are shown in \nFigure\\,\\ref{fig:electron_spectrum}.\n\nThey indicate that the observed energy spectra of the bursts on the ground\ncan be explained by the almost monochromatic electrons with small energy spreads at the projection height.\nPeak flux of the source electrons of each burst is \n$(1.9\\pm 0.1)\\times 10^{5}{\\rm m}^{-2}{\\rm s}^{-1}$, \n$(2.0\\pm 0.1)\\times 10^{5}{\\rm m}^{-2}{\\rm s}^{-1}$ and \n$(8.8\\pm 0.5)\\times 10^{4}{\\rm m}^{-2}{\\rm s}^{-1}$,\nfor burst-20111225, burst-20120102 and burst-20120105, respectively.  \nIt should be noted that the estimated heights are the lower limits.  If lower-energy electron components were added in the source energy spectrum, source had to be higher so that resulting lower-energy shower does not affect the fitting much.  In the same sense, the estimated source electron fluxes are also the lower limits.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\n    \\mbox{\\includegraphics[width=7cm]\n    {figures/900m-target.burst-20111225.6MeV_bin.from17MeV.result.fit.eps}}\n    \\mbox{\\includegraphics[width=7cm]\n    {figures/500m-target.burst-20120102.6MeV_bin.from17MeV.result.fit.eps}}\n    \\mbox{\\includegraphics[width=7cm]\n    {figures/100m-target.burst-20120105.6MeV_bin.from17MeV.result.fit.eps}}\n    \\caption{Simulated spectra which match the observed burst spectra best.

However, the present analysis has little power to examine the theoretically favored model~\\cite{Dwyer2011} in which the spectrum becomes exponential shape independent of the electric field or the air density.\n\nThe duration of the bursts may depend on\nthe movement or the development stage of the clouds.\nFor example, the duration of the burst-20120105, $\\sim180\\,{\\rm s}$\ncan be explained by a thundercloud which have\ntypical velocity of 50\\,km/h and diameter of 2.5\\,km, \nwhich is somewhat smaller than typical echo size of thunderclouds \n(which is 4-6\\,km~\\cite{Kitagawa1994}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, due to the low temperature,\nthe altitude of the thunderclouds at midwinter\nis low in the coastal area of the Japan Sea~\\cite{Kitagawa1994},\nwhich explains the result that \nthe observed energy spectra implies the low altitude electron source.\nSimilar winter thunderclouds are relatively rare, but are also observed in the west coast of Norway\nand toward the east coast from the Great Lakes of North America.\n\nRREA and resulting electromagnetic shower may exist also in more common high altitude thunderclouds in summer.\nHowever, $\\gamma$-rays and electrons of shower may totally absorbed by the thick air under the clouds. \nIt is also consistent with the observations that long duration bursts are reported in summer on high mountains,\nwhere the relative altitude of the clouds are very low.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe observed three $\\gamma$-ray bursts in winter\nwith the PANDA detector made of 360-kg plastic scintillator\nat Ohi Power Station\nwhich stands on the coastal area of the Japan Sea.\nTable.~\\ref{tab:features} summarizes the features of the observed bursts.\nThe maximum rate of the events with $E_{\\rm total} \\ge 3\\,{\\rm MeV}$\nwas $(5.5 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^2 {\\rm /s}$ \nof burst-20120105.\n\nWe found that \nfor all the bursts periods,\nthere were active thunderclouds near the detector.\n\nIn addition,\nwe found that $\\gamma$-rays of the bursts entered into the \ndetector from the direction close to the zenith.\nThe arrival direction stayed constant during the burst.\n\nThese results indicated that the bursts originated in thunderclouds.\nMonte Carlo simulation showed that\nthe observed $E_{\\rm total}$ spectra of the bursts\nare well described by the bremsstrahlung $\\gamma$-rays by\nelectrons with more or less monochromatic energy shown in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:electron_spectrum}\nfrom low altitudes.\n\nThe arrival direction of the $\\gamma$-rays and\nthe estimated energy of the source electrons of over $10\\,{\\rm MeV}$\ncan be described by relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA).\nNamely, the secondary cosmic-ray electrons, which act as seed,\nwere accelerated and amplified in electric field of thunderclouds.\nThe estimated approximately monochromatic nature of the source electrons needs some sort of explanation.\n\nAdditionally, neutrons were detected in one of the bursts\nat the maximum rate of $\\sim 14\\pm5\\, {\\rm /s}$\nwith high confidence by the delayed coincidence method.\nThere is probability the event rate increase\nincludes neutrons emitted by the photonuclear reactions\non the nitrogen atoms in the air.\nIt could be due to the large flux of bremsstrahlung $\\gamma$-ray \nwith energy greater than the photonuclear reaction threshold for nitrogen.\nThe observation of fast neutrons on the ground implies\nthat more neutrons are produced in the air between a thundercloud and the ground\nand even in the cloud itself.\nThose neutrons, however, would not reach the ground because of the short absorption length\nin the air. \n\n\\begin{table*}[tbp]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\caption{Features of the three $\\gamma$-ray bursts}\n    \\label{tab:features}\n    \\begin{tabular}{p{6cm}|p{2.5cm}p{2.5cm}p{2.5cm}}\\hline\n      burst name& burst-20111225 & burst-20120102 & burst-20120105\\\\ \\hline\n      date of the burst & \n      2011, Dec. 25 & 2012, Jan. 2 & 2012, Jan. 5\\\\\n      time(JST)& \n      05:07 & 09:19 & 06:46\\\\\n      duration [s] &\n      90 & 60 & 180 \\\\\n      peak event rate ($E_{\\rm tot} > 3{\\rm MeV}$) [s$^{-1}$] & \n      $(2.3\\pm0.1)\\times 10^2$ & $(5.1\\pm0.1)\\times 10^2$\n      & $(5.5\\pm0.1)\\times 10^2$\\\\\n      correlated(neutron) events&\n      not-detected & not-detected & detected\\\\\n      estimated  majority energy of the source electrons [MeV] &\n      $17 $ & $17 $ & $17 $ \\\\\n      estimated height of the source electrons [m]&\n      900& 500& 100\\\\\n      estimated source electron flux[m$^{-2} $ s$^{-1}$]&\n      $(1.9\\pm 0.1) \\times 10^5$ & $(2.0\\pm 0.1) \\times 10^5$ & $(8.8\\pm 0.5)\\times10^4$\\\\\n      \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThe authors thank the Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. for its cooperation for our experiment on site of Ohi Power Station.\nThe authors wish to acknowledge useful discussions with Dr. T.
