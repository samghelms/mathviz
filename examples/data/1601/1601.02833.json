No craters are evident\nin this data set, giving a conservative result\nthat no craters larger than 2~km\nexist in SP (using 5~pixels conservatively\nas the detection limit).\nA small fraction of SP, amounting to\naround 0.13\\% of the surface of Pluto,\nhas been imaged at the relatively high\nresolution of 125~m/pixel. No craters are\nevident in this data set either, giving\na conservative result that no craters\nlarger than $\\sim$625~m\nexist in this\nsmall region of SP.\nWe correct the impact interval above\nby this surface coverage fraction\n(1/2.5\\% and 1/0.13\\%, respectively).\n\nRecent detailed work on the cratering behavior\non Pluto \\cite{beau} predicts that\n$D$, the final crater\ndiameter, is proportional to $d^{0.783}$, where\n$d$ is the impactor diameter.\nThe 2~km\ncrater detection limit in the low resolution\ndata corresponds roughly to 400~m\nimpactors, while\nthe 625~m\ncrater detection limit in the\nhigh resolution imagery corresponds \nroughly to\n90~m\nimpactors.\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Results and discussion}\n\nThe imagery requires \nthat no craters caused by 400~m (low resolution)\nor 90~m (high resolution)\nimpactors exist in SP. Given the known\nimpact interval as a function of size (from above),\nwe can estimate the maximum surface age\nof SP.\nThe results are shown in Fig~\\ref{rate}.\n\n\n\n\nThe (black, red) lines show the constraints\nprovided by the (low, high) resolution\nimages.\nIn both cases, the conclusion is that\nthe surface age of SP must be less\nthan around 10~million years.\n\nThis maximum surface age is surprisingly\nyoung and implies that\nthis area of Pluto must be undergoing\nactive resurfacing, presumably\nthrough some\ncryo-geophysical process.\nThere are at least three potential\nmechanisms by which craters could be erased\nfrom SP.\nThe following discussion\nis largely adapted from \\cite{melosh}.\n\nIt is possible that craters in SP undergo\n{\\em viscous relaxation}, in which the surface\nmaterial flows to relieve any topographic\nfeatures and horizontal and vertical stresses.\nThe viscous relaxation timescale $\\tau_R$ --- the time\nit takes for the height of a surface feature to\ndiminish by a factor of $1/e$ --- is\ngiven approximately by $3 \\eta / \\rho g w$,\nwhere $\\eta$ is the effective viscosity,\n$\\rho$ is the density, \n$g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and\n$w$ is the breadth of the depression (in this case,\na crater).\nThe density of Pluto's nitrogen ice is\naround 1000~kg/m$^3$ \\cite{scott}\nand \nthe gravitational acceleration on Pluto is \naround 0.66~m/s$^2$. To cause a \n625~meter crater (the smallest \nsize detectable in the data)\nto relax over $10^7$~years\ntherefore requires an effective viscosity of\nthe SP surface layer material, which is largely\nnitrogen ice,\nof around\n$4\\times10^{19}$~Pa-s.\nBecause the relaxation timescale is\nan upper limit (the surface must be\nyounger than $10^7$~years), the actual\neffective viscosity must be equal to or\nless than this value.\nThis is a relatively loose constraint on viscosity;\na tighter constraint arises\nfrom the next interpretation.\n\nA second possibility is that craters in SP are\nerased and the surface reset through {\\em convective\noverturn}. The physics of this anomaly correction\nis similar to that of viscous relaxation, except that\nthe proximate cause is now a temperature \ndifference from the bottom to the top of the \nconvective cell. This temperature difference\ncauses a density anomaly $\\Delta \\rho$.\nThe overturn timescale \n$\\tau_{overturn}$ is therefore\napproximately\n$\\eta / \\Delta \\rho g L$, where $L$\nis now the vertical dimension.\nThe difference in density between nitrogen\nice at 40~K (Pluto surface temperature)\nand 60~K (the temperature\nnear the base of the ``cryo-lithosphere''\njust below the nitrogen melting temperature)\nis around 5\\% \\cite{scott},\nso we use this value for $\\Delta \\rho$.\nWe assume\nthat the \n``cell boundaries'' seen in the images\nindicate the horizontal extent of the \nconvection cells --- around 30~km ---\nand that the vertical size of a convection\ncell is around three times smaller than the \nhorizontal extent, or around \n10~km.\nWe find \na viscosity of equal to or less than\naround $10^{17}$ Pa-s.\nWe have not taken\ninto account the stress dependence of \nthe effective viscosity, which would lower\nour estimate somewhat. Nevertheless,\nthis result is consistent with the viscosity of\nnitrogen ice at 45~K derived by \\cite{yamashita}\nof around $10^8$~Pa-s,\nand indicates that convective overturn is \na plausible mechanism for removing craters\nof this size on SP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA third possible mechanism to erase craters\non SP is through {\\em cryovolcanism}\nthat conveys melt\nfrom a subsurface reservoir. The assumption\nhere is that at the base of the SP surface layer,\nwhich we again take to be on the order of 10~km,\nthere is (perhaps partial) melting of nitrogen ice. \nThis liquid material, which is under pressure,\ncould be extruded to the surface\nthrough local cracks (presumably the \nsame cell boundaries described above) and fill\nin any negative topography before freezing.\nThis mechanism requires that \nthe temperature at the base of the SP surface\nlayer be around 63~K, at which temperature solid\nnitrogen melts, compared to the surface temperature\nof 38~K.\nThis implies a temperature difference\nof around 25~K\n(the temperature difference across\nthe SP surface layer) over a vertical\ndistance of around 10~km, for a thermal\ngradient of around 2.5~K/km.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe volume\nof infill material extruded in $10^7$~years\nmust equal the volume of the crater that is\nerased, which is roughly\n$\\pi D^3 / 80$, where the factor\nof~10 in the denominator arises from\nthe typical depth/diameter ratio of~1:10.\nThe melt production rate must therefore\nbe around 1~m$^3$/year or\n$10^7$~m$^3$\n(0.01~km$^3$)\nin ten million years\nin order to erase a single crater of\norder 625~meters in diameter.\n\nA last uncertainty in the above constraints\nis that the size distribution of KBOs\nat 100~meters is not well known. In our\nestimate here we have used a reasonable\nextrapolation from \\cite{B04}. However,\nthe number of KBOs at that size range \ncould plausibly be a factor of ten\ngreater \\cite{schlichting},\nwhich makes the surface age of SP younger\nby that same factor. Alternately, if \nthe number of small KBOs is less than\nwe assumed (for instance, as in\n\\cite{fraser}), then the surface\nage increases by the same factor.\nThe estimate used here\nis an appropriate middle ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Conclusions and future work}\n\nWe have used knowledge of\nthe Kuiper Belt from telescopic observations\nto constrain the age of Sputnik Planum, Pluto.\nIn the future, additional high-resolution\nimaging of SP as well as well-characterized\ncrater counting on Pluto's surface could be\nused to constrain the small size\nend of the KBO population. In particular, \na better understanding \nof the crater detection limit in SP\nwill help constrain the number\nof KBOs smaller than 100~meters.\nAlternately, very deep and well-characterized\nsurveys for small KBOs might place interesting\nconstraints on the cryo-geophysics of Pluto.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\caption{\n{\\bf Impact interval onto Sputnik Planum, Pluto, in Earth\nyears as a function of impactor size.}\nThe black line shows the constraint from\nthe low resolution imaging (400~m/pixel),\nwhich has greater areal coverage; the red line\nshows the constraint from the small amount\nof high resolution (125~m/pixel) imaging\navailable at the time of writing.\nThe size distribution of KBOs larger than\n10~km is taken from \\cite{parker}.\nFor sizes smaller than 10~km, estimates and\nextrapolations from \\cite{B04}\nare used.\nImpactors of size 400~m and 90~m\nwould create craters with the indicated\nsizes (as derived from scaling laws presented in\n\\cite{beau}),\nwhich would be at the resolution limit\nof the low and high resolution imaging,\nrespectively.\nWe conclude that the surface of Sputnik Planum\nmust be younger than around 10~million Earth\nyears. \nThis conclusion is drawn both\nfrom the fact that\nno craters 2~km in diameter have\nbeen detected in the low resolution\ndata and no craters 625~meters\nin diameter have been detected\nin the smaller amount of high resolution imagery.\nThe two measurements give\nthe same constraint for the maximum\nsurface age of Sputnik Planum.\n}\n\\label{rate}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nI thank Will Grundy\nfor many helpful conversations and\nJohn Compton for suggestions\nabout geophysical possibilities.\nTwo anonymous referees provided\nhelpful comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\n\\bibitem{science}\nStern, SA,\nBagenal, F,\nGladstone, GR,\nGrundy, WM,\nMcKinnon, WB,\nMoore, JM,\net al.\nThe Pluto system: Initial results from\nits exploration by New Horizons.\nScience.\n2015; 350: aad1815\n\n\\bibitem{beau}\nBierhaus, EB, Dones, L.\nCraters and ejecta on Pluto and Charon: Anticipated results from the New Horizons flyby.\nIcarus.\n2015; 246: 165\n\n\\bibitem{deelia}\nde El\\'ia, GC, Di Sisto, RP,\nBrunini, A.\nImpactor flux and cratering on the Pluto-Charon system.\nAstronomy \\& Astrophysics.\n2010; 521: A23\n\n\\bibitem{greenstreet}\nGreenstreet, S, Gladman, B, \\& McKinnon, WB.\nImpact and cratering rates onto Pluto.\nIcarus.\n2015; 258: 267\n\n\\bibitem{parker}\nParker, AH,\nBuie, M,\nFraser, W,\nPorter, SB,\nWeaver, H, \nStern, SA,\net al.\nUpdating the Kuiper Belt luminosity function with the \nHST search for a New Horizons post-Pluto target.\n2015.\nLunar Planet.\\ Sci.\\ Conf.\\\nabstract \\#2614\n\n\\bibitem{fraser2014}\nFraser, WC,\nBrown, ME,\nMorbidelli, A,\nParker, A,\nBatygin, K\nThe Absolute Magnitude Distribution of Kuiper Belt Objects.\nAstrophysical Journal. 2014;\n782:100\n\n\\bibitem{B04}\nBernstein, GM,\nTrilling, DE,\nAllen, RL,\nBrown, ME,\nHolman, M,\nMalhotra, R.\nThe Size Distribution of Trans-Neptunian Bodies.\nAstronomical Journal.\n2004; 128: 1364\n\n\\bibitem{melosh}\nMelosh, H.

Gravitational\nfocusing for Pluto is negligible. The volume\noccupied by the Kuiper Belt is\n$C_{KB} \\pi R^2$, where $C_{KB}$ is\napproximately 40~AU, and $R$ is the \nwidth of the main part of the Kuiper Belt,\naround 2~AU. Thus, the fraction of the Kuiper\nBelt that Pluto sweeps out is simply\n$(r/R)^2$, which is around $1.5\\times 10^{-11}$.\nThis fraction must be reduced by the ratio\nof the mean impact velocity (estimated to be around 2~km/sec by \\cite{beau})\nto\nPluto's orbital velocity of 4.7~km/sec to\naccount for the fact that Pluto is not orbiting\nin a static field of impacting KBOs, but \nrather that the surrounding KBO swarm\nis also orbiting the Sun.\n\nThe number of impacts onto Pluto per Pluto\nyear as a function of size (that is, $H$), on average, is therefore given by\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nN(<H)~{\\rm deg^{-2}} \\times 3600~{\\rm deg}^2 \\times \\frac{2.0~{\\rm km/sec}}{4.7~{\\rm km/sec}} \\times 1.5\\times10^{-11}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N(&lt;H)~{}{\\rm deg^{-2}}\\times 3600~{}{\\rm deg}^{2}\\times\\frac{2.0~{}{\\rm km/sec%&#10;}}{4.7~{}{\\rm km/sec}}\\times 1.5\\times 10^{-11}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>N</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>H</mi><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><msup><mi>deg</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u00d7</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>3600</mn></mpadded><msup><mi>deg</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u00d7</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>2.0</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>km</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>sec</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>4.7</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>km</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>sec</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u00d7</mo><mn>1.5</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>11</mn></mrow></msup><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
