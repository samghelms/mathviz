All \nobservations utilized a 1\\arcsec$\\times$180\\arcsec\\ longslit aligned at a \nposition angle of $-12.2^{\\circ}$ in order to capture both quasar candidates. \nThe objects were dispersed with the 270~mm$^{-1}$ grating at a \nresolution of $R\\sim640$. For the 2014 Jan 9 observations the central\nwavelength was set to 7500~\\AA, providing wavelength coverage from\n5670\\AA\\ to 9290\\AA, and the total integration time was 70\\,min.\nFor the 2014 Jan 10 and 2014 Aug 28 observations the central wavelength\nwas 8500\\AA~(6600\\AA\\ $\\la \\lambda \\la$ 1$\\mu$m) and the total \nintegration times were 45\\,min.\\ and 60\\,min., respectively. In all cases \nthe seeing was marginal (1{\\farcs}5 -- 2\\arcsec) with non-photometric \nconditions.\n\nThe spectra were processed in a standard fashion with Pyraf-based\nscripts; details of the processing method are given in \\citet{McGreer13}.\nWavelength calibration was provided by an internal HeNeAr lamp, and an\napproximate flux calibration was obtained from observations of the \nspectrophotometric standard star Feige 110. The calibrations were taken\nimmediately before the science spectra. The processed spectra from\neach of the three nights were interpolated onto a common linear wavelength\ngrid and combined using inverse-variance weighting. The final spectra\nare displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:spectra}.\n\nThe spectroscopy immediately confirmed that both candidates are quasars \nat $z\\sim5$. In Section~\\ref{sec:pairorlens} we interpret the spectra and\nother available data in order to determine whether they represent two\nquasars at a similar redshift or gravitationally lensed images of a\nsingle source quasar.\n\nWe have obtained a total of 19 MMT spectra out of the 47 candidates with\n$i<23$ in W1 and W3. A more complete analysis of this sample will be \npresented in a future work. Relevant to this work, we note that {\\em all} \nof the observed objects are quasars at $z \\ga 4.5$, indicating that the\ncolor selection is highly pure. In addition, our simulations show that\nthe color selection is highly complete ($>90$\\%) in the range \n$4.75 < z \\la 5.15$, with a tail to $\\sim50\\%$ completeness out to $z\\sim5.4$ \n\\citep[see][for details on the simulation method]{McGreer13}. Although we\nhave spectra for only 40\\% of our candidates, we consider it highly\nlikely that any similar pair of small-separation quasars would be included\nin our target list, and thus we conclude that only one such pair lies within\nthe 90~deg$^2$ search area to the flux limit of $i<23$\\footnote{We searched\nour candidate list for additional pairs and found two quasars with a\nseparation of 80\\arcsec; however, they have a redshift difference of\n$\\Delta{z}=0.15$.}. This estimate of the area of our survey (90~deg$^2$) will \nbe used in \\S\\ref{sec:clustering} to infer the clustering strength of quasars \nat $z\\sim5$.\n\n\n\\subsection{Additional Observations}\n\n{CFHTLS J0221-0342}\\ lies within the XMM-LSS \\citep{xmmlss} survey region, and thus has a \nwide array of multiwavelength observations. Table~\\ref{tab:photometry} lists \nphotometric observations of the quasar pair, including deep near-IR photometry \nfrom the UKIDSS Deep eXtragalactic Survey \\citep[DXS;][]{ukidss} and deep \nSpitzer photometry from the SWIRE survey \\citep{swire}. \nThe brighter quasar is also an X-ray source in the XMM-XXL survey and was \nincluded as an ancillary quasar target in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 \\citep{DR12}. This ancillary \nprogram\\footnote{{\\url{http://www.sdss.org/dr12/algorithms/ancillary/boss/xmmfollowup/}}} targeted XMM-XXL sources for spectroscopy; \n{QSO-A}\\ was the highest redshift X-ray source in the sample, with a redshift \nof $z=5.011$.\n\nIt is important to note that although {CFHTLS J0221-0342}\\ happens to lie within a deep \nextragalactic survey field, for our survey it was selected based on optical \ncolors from the CFHTLS-Wide alone. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{J0221ABsed}\n\\caption{SEDs for {QSO-A}\\ and {QSO-B}\\ obtained from the CFHTLS-Wide imaging\n ($griz$; the $g$-band measurements are below the plot boundary in the upper\n panel), UKIDSS DXS ($JK$), and Spitzer/SWIRE (3.6$\\mu$m and 4.5$\\mu$m).\n The upper panel compares the photometric measurements for the two objects;\n the SED for QSO-A is shifted downward so that the $\\chi^2$ difference\n between the two SEDs is minimized.

Because lensing \nis achromatic, if they are lensed images the two objects should present \nsimilar colors at all wavelengths. There are two important effects that can\naffect the observed colors: 1) differential reddening along the independent \nlight paths to the two images, and 2) time delays between the lensed images\ncombined with intrinsic source variability. Figure~\\ref{fig:seds} presents\nthe multiwavelength SEDs of {CFHTLS J0221-0342}, where deviations as large as\n$\\sim$30\\% from the mean flux offset are present across a wide range of\nwavelengths. These differences are far greater than the photometric \nuncertainties, which are $<1$\\% from $g$-band to $K$-band. The statistical\nuncertainties are appropriate here since the photometry represents \n{\\em relative} flux measurements between the two objects, as the same \ncalibrations have been applied to both objects. In addition, because of their \nproximity, the photometry of the two objects is always simultaneous, \nminimizing any differences arising from intrinsic source variability. We apply \nthe $\\chi^2$ statistic given by  \\citet[][their equation 2]{Hen06} to the two \nSEDs as a test of the hypothesis that a simple flux scaling combined with \nphotometric scatter accounts for their differences (i.e., they are lensed \nimages) and rule this out at high significance, obtaining $\\chi^2/\\nu$ = 223/7 \nfrom the multiwavelength SEDs\\footnote{\\citet{Hen06} obtain a median value of \n$\\chi^2/\\nu$ = 33.1/4 for a sample of SDSS quasars at $2.4 < z < 2.45$; the \nexpectation for lensed images in the absence of differential reddening is \n$\\chi^2/\\nu \\sim 1$. To compute this value we use the photometry from $g$ \nthrough 4.5$\\mu$m where both objects are well detected, hence the 7 degrees of \nfreedom. If we restrict the data to the $griz$ bands to better compare with \nthe SDSS data, we obtain $\\chi^2/\\nu$ = 212/3.}. Finally, there is no trend in \nthe flux differences that would be consistent with reddening.\n\nThe MMT spectra of the two objects are highly similar to the level of the \n$S/N$ and resolution available. We obtain a small redshift difference from \nfitting the \\ion{O}{1} emission line in the MMT spectra; Gaussian fits with \nthe IRAF {\\it splot} command return $z({\\rm A})=5.016$ and $z({\\rm B})=5.019$, \na difference of $\\approx160${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}. However, the \\ion{O}{1} line is weakly \ndetected in the {QSO-B}\\ spectrum and the uncertainty on the line centroid is \n$\\approx 300${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}, thus this difference is not significant. The Ly$\\alpha$ \nlines are detected at high $S/N$ in both spectra and the line profiles in the \nwings are nearly identical (Fig.~\\ref{fig:lyacompare}), agreeing to within \ntwo spectral pixels, or $\\la270${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}. As it is difficult to conclusively\nstate the velocity offset between the two spectra, in the rest of this work\nwe adopt the difference obtained from the \\ion{O}{1} fits, \n$\\Delta{z} \\la 0.03$.\n\nThere are differences between the two spectra that indicate they are not \nlikely to originate from a single source quasar. {QSO-B}\\ has a clear absorption \nfeature just blueward of Ly$\\alpha$ at $\\sim$7286\\AA\\ while {QSO-A}\\ has a \ntransmission peak at $\\sim$7170\\AA; both of these features are significantly \nweaker in the opposite spectrum (Figure~\\ref{fig:lyacompare}). Also, the \n\\ion{N}{5} emission from {QSO-A}\\ is greater than that from {QSO-B}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{J0221_lyacompare}\n\\caption{Ly$\\alpha$ emission line profiles for {QSO-A}\\ (blue) and {QSO-B}\\ \n (dark gray). The rms noise is shown as shaded regions (for {QSO-A}\\ it is\n roughly the same as the line width). The\n {QSO-A}\\ spectrum has been rescaled by the continuum flux ratio between\n the two objects at 8200\\AA. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission from {QSO-A}\\ has\n larger equivalent width, as does the \\ion{N}{5} emission line at\n 7440\\AA\\ (note that the {QSO-B}\\ spectrum has a redder continuum slope, \n consistent with its redder $r-i$ color, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:colors}).\n The Ly$\\alpha$ emission of {QSO-B}\\ has stronger absorption\n features. The wings of the two lines are nearly identical, indicating\n that the velocity offset is extremely small; it is $\\la 2$ pixels or\n $\\la 270~{\\rm km}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$.\n \\label{fig:lyacompare}} \n\\end{figure}\n\nAnother consideration is that a configuration that produces a large separation \n(21\\arcsec) image pair of a $z=5$ quasar is highly unlikely; only three\nlarge-separation lensed quasar systems are known in the entire SDSS \n\\citep{Inada03,Dahle13,Rusu13}. Large separations can arise from group- or \ncluster-scale lens masses. For this configuration, the peak in the expected \nlens redshift distribution is at $z\\sim0.7$ and the probability of a source \nquasar at $z=5$ with an image separation $>20$\\arcsec\\ is extremely small \n\\citep{Hen07,Li07}. Furthermore, the CFHTLS imaging is sufficiently deep that \na group-scale overdensity at $z<1$ should be immediately apparent in the \noptical imaging, but as Figure~\\ref{fig:colorim} shows, there are no galaxies \ndetected between {QSO-A}\\ and {QSO-B}, and no obvious overdensity of galaxies in \nthe vicinity.\n\nIn conclusion, the mismatched SEDs of the two objects and the lack of any\nobvious foreground mass to generate a wide separation lens configuration\nstrongly argue against the lens hypothesis for this pair of objects. We\nproceed to interpret them as a binary quasar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Implications for Quasar Clustering at $z > 5$}\n\\label{sec:clustering}\n\nQuasars peak as a luminous population near $z\\sim2.5$, and bright quasars at higher redshift are increasingly\nrare \\citep{Ric06}. Combining the depth and area necessary\nto survey large numbers of $z\\sim5$ quasars is therefore taxing. Due to the difficulty in studying a significant\nquantity of\nquasars at high redshift, quasar clustering has only been measured in a statistical fashion out to $z\\sim4$, by \\citet{She07}, who found\na correlation length of $r_{\\rm 0} \\sim24${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. This level of clustering is considered ``large,'' in the sense that\nit is at the limits of what might be predicted by theoretical models that use the luminosity function to infer quasar clustering \\citep[e.g.][]{Hop07}\nand in the sense that clustering measurements at $z\\sim2.5$ typically obtain significantly smaller values of \n$r_{\\rm 0} \\sim8${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ \\citep[e.g.][]{Whi12,Eft15}. That $r_{\\rm 0}$ seems large at\n$z\\sim4$ motivates further measurements of quasar clustering to determine if $r_{\\rm 0}$ remains large\nat comparable or higher redshifts.\n\nA small number of close quasar pairs can be used as an alternative method\nfor quantifying the clustering of high redshift quasars. In the absence\nof clustering it would be extraordinarily unlikely to find multiple quasars \nwithin a small cosmological volume, hence pairs can be used to infer the \nclustering strength required to increase the likelihood of companion quasars\nwith small separations.\nAn example of this approach is that of \\citet{Sch00}, who used a single binary quasar at $z=4.25$ separated by $\\Delta\\theta=33.4$\\arcsec\\ on \nthe plane of the sky to infer $r_{\\rm 0} \\sim12$--30\\,Mpc for the correlation length of $z\\sim4$ quasars, presaging the \n \\citet{She07} estimate of $r_{\\rm 0} \\sim24${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. In our chosen cosmology, the transverse projected separation of the \\citet{Sch00}\nquasar pair is 160{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ compared to 90{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ ($\\Delta\\theta=21$\\arcsec; $z=5.02$) for the pair we have discovered. \n\nIn this section we use our binary quasar to estimate $r_{\\rm 0}$ for quasars at $z\\sim5$. It may be helpful \nto remember that at $z=5$, an angle of 1\\arcsec\\ subtends a transverse separation of 26{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ comoving (4.35{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ proper).\n\n\n\\subsection{The luminosity function}\\label{qlf}\n\nThe significance of observing a close pair of quasars relative to random\nchance is determined from the QLF. We adopt the recent measurement of the QLF \nat $z=5$ from \\citet{McGreer13} based on quasars drawn from the SDSS Stripe 82 \nregion, extending to a depth of $i=22$. Although {CFHTLS J0221-0342}\\ is drawn from a \ndeeper survey ($i<23$) and thus requires extrapolation from the \n\\citet{McGreer13} results, it is worth noting that both quasars have $i<22$ \nand are thus within the range of the Stripe 82 measurement.\n\nThe QLF is typically fit with a double power-law form,\n\\begin {equation}\\label{phi}\n\\Phi(M,z)=\\frac{\\Phi^{*}(z)}{10^{0.4(\\alpha+1)(M-M^{*})}+10^{0.4(\\beta+1)(M-M^{*})}} ~.\n\\end{equation} \n\\citet{McGreer13} estimate the characteristic luminosity to be \n$M^{*}=-27.21$ and the faint and bright end slopes to be $\\alpha=-2.03$ and \n$\\beta=-4.0$, respectively. The parameter $\\Phi^{*}$ is best described by \na term that evolves with redshift, \n$\\log \\Phi^{*}(z)=\\log \\Phi^{*}(z=6)+k(z-6)$, with \n$\\log \\Phi^{*}(z=6)=-8.94$ and $\\rm k=-0.47$ (see \\S 6 of \\citealt{McGreer13} \nfor a detailed discussion on the fitting procedure and redshift evolution of \nthe QLF parameters). \n\nAs noted in \\S\\ref{sec:observations}, our survey of $z\\sim5$ quasars has \nprogressed such that it is reasonable to assume our binary quasar is drawn \nfrom a complete survey covering 90{\\,deg$^{2}$}\\ to a flux limit of $i < 23$. The \nnumber density of quasars brighter than $i'=23$ in our survey is calculated \nby taking  the integral of the QLF between the $k$-corrected absolute \nmagnitudes,  $M_{i}^{\\rm bright}$ and $M_{i'}$, corresponding to the bright \nand faint end of the apparent magnitude range of our survey:\n\\begin {equation}\\label{phist}\nn(z,i<i')=\\int_{M_{i}^{\\rm bright}}^{M_{i'}} dM_{i} ~ \\Phi(M_{i},z).\n\\end{equation} \n\nWe use a constant $k$-correction of $k_{\\rm corr}=-2.2$, which is reasonable \nover the full redshift range of interest \\citep[see Fig.\\ 6 of][]{McGreer13}.\nThe number densities obtained from the QLF are relatively insensitive to the \nbright limit (in apparent magnitude) adopted for the integration. We ignore\nthe incompleteness due to our selection efficiency, which would reduce the \nobserved number densities. We stress that this makes our measurements more\nconservative, in that any incompleteness in our survey would {\\em increase}\nthe inferred clustering signal, as we would be more likely to have missed\nadditional close pairs. The QLF predicts $\\sim0.9${\\,deg$^{2}$}\\ quasars over the \nredshift range $4.7<z<5.2$, which already hints that a quasar pair separated \nby 21\\arcsec\\ at $z\\sim5$ would be highly unusual if quasars were not\nsignificantly clustered at high redshift.\n \n\n\\subsection{Estimating the Correlation Length Using the \\citet{Sch00} Formalism}\\label{clsres}\n\nFollowing \\citet{Sch00} we determine the correlation length of quasars by \ncomparing the single pair we have found to the number of pairs we would \nexpect to find in the volume enclosing our pair. The mean number expected in \na given volume can be determined from the QLF. The odds of finding two quasars \nin that volume (corresponding to our binary quasar) can then be determined \nfrom the Poisson distribution, as Poisson statistics are an excellent model \nfor quasar clustering on small scales where the pairs are independent \n\\citep[e.g.][]{Mye06}. The correlation length can be related to the excess \nclustering over random as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 9091, "prevtext": "\n\n\\title{A Constraint on Quasar Clustering at $z=5$ from a Binary Quasar}\n\n\\slugcomment{Accepted for publication by AJ}\n\n\\thanks{Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.}\n\n\\author{\nIan~D.~McGreer\\altaffilmark{1},\nSarah~Eftekharzadeh\\altaffilmark{2},\nAdam~D.~Myers\\altaffilmark{2}, and\nXiaohui~Fan\\altaffilmark{1}\n}\n\n\\altaffiltext{1}{\nSteward Observatory, 933 North Cherry Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA.\n}\n\\email{imcgreer@as.arizona.edu}\n\n\\altaffiltext{2}{\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, \nUniversity of Wyoming, \nLaramie, WY 82071, USA.\n}\n\n\\shortauthors{McGreer et al.}\n\\shorttitle{A $z=5$ Binary Quasar}\n\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nWe report the discovery of a quasar pair at $z=5$ separated by 21\\arcsec.\nBoth objects were identified as quasar candidates using simple color selection\ntechniques applied to photometric catalogs from the CFHT Legacy Survey \n(CFHTLS). Spectra obtained with the MMT present no discernible offset in \nredshift between the two objects; on the other hand, there are clear \ndifferences in the emission line profiles and in the multiwavelength spectral \nenergy distributions that strongly disfavor the hypothesis that they are\ngravitationally lensed images of a single quasar. Both quasars are \nsurprisingly bright given their proximity (a projected separation of \n$\\sim135$~kpc), with $i=19.4$ and $i=21.4$. Previous measurements of the \nluminosity function demonstrate that luminous quasars are extremely rare at \n$z=5$; the existence of this pair suggests that quasars have strong \nsmall-scale clustering at high redshift. Assuming a real-space correlation \nfunction of the form $\\xi(r) \\propto (r/r_0)^{-2}$, this discovery implies a \ncorrelation length $r_0 \\ga 20${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}, consistent with a rapid strengthening \nof quasar clustering at high redshift as seen in previous observations and \npredicted by theoretical models where feedback effects are inefficient at \nshutting down black hole growth at high redshift.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\keywords{quasars: general --- quasars: individual (CFHTLS J022112.61-034252.1, CFHTLS J022112.31-034231.6) --- galaxies: halos }\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nThe discovery that luminous quasars cluster strongly at redshifts approaching \n$z\\sim 4$ \\citep[with a scale length of $r_0\\sim25$\\,{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$};][]{She07} \npotentially poses an interesting cosmological challenge. It could be that \nquasar clustering strongly declines with luminosity at high redshift, meaning\nthat current samples only trace the most strongly clustered sources. But, \nfaint quasars do not appear to cluster significantly more weakly than bright \nquasars at $z\\sim2.5$ \\citep{Whi12,Eft15} or below \n\\citep[e.g.][]{daA08,She09,She13}. Thus, if quasar clustering is highly \nluminosity-dependent at $z\\sim4.5$, then quasars (as a population) would have \nto alter rapidly over 10\\% of the Hubble Time, then change more quiescently\nover the final 80\\% of cosmic history. Further, most models invoke a narrow \nrange of halo mass for a wide range of quasar luminosity in order to \nreproduce the quasar luminosity function (e.g., \\citealt{Lid06}; see also \nthe discussion in Appendix B of \\citealt{Whi12}).\n\nAlternatively, quasars at high redshift could simply trace the growth of \ntheir parent dark matter halos while they are actively accreting. \nSuch a scenario essentially represents the maximal possible increase in \nclustering amplitude with redshift; under scenarios other than this ``maximal \ngrowth'' model the correlation length of quasars should eventually diminish\nat high redshift. Fig.\\ 13 of \\citet{Hop07} illustrates this point --- \nquasar clustering should decrease at $z>4$ for scenarios in which quasars \nare efficiently quenched.\n\nObservations of quasar clustering at $z>4$ are currently limited to \nrelatively small samples of highly luminous quasars \\citep{She07}. Improving\nthis situation is a significant challenge, given that it requires expensive\nspectroscopic campaigns targeting faint candidates at low sky density\n($\\sim$1~deg$^{-2}$). One promising avenue is the study of pairs of quasars \nthat are separated by both a small angle on the plane of the sky and by a \nsmall velocity window in redshift space. Such pairs, often called ``binary \nquasars'' in the literature, are sufficiently rare to confirm with dedicated \nspectroscopic follow-up, but have a very strong clustering strength. Binary \nquasars can therefore be used to estimate the correlation length of quasar\nclustering even using small samples \\citep[e.g.][]{Hen06,Mye08,She10}. Of \norder a dozen $z\\sim4$ binary quasars with proper separations of less than \n$\\sim1$~Mpc are currently known \\citep[e.g.][]{Hen10}.\n\nThe highest redshift binary quasar discovered to date is a quasar pair at \n$z=4.26$ separated by 33\\arcsec, or about 230\\,kpc proper, on the plane of \nthe sky \\citep{Sch00}. The pair was discovered serendipitously---while \nspectroscopically confirming an $i=20.4$ quasar candidate a second $i=21.3$ \nquasar at the same redshift happened to be located in the slit. This single \nquasar pair was sufficient to ascertain that $z \\sim4.25$ quasars cluster with \na correlation length of $r_0\\sim10$--30\\,Mpc, an observation later confirmed \nusing much larger samples by \\citet{She07}. In this paper, we present a \nsimilar find. During a survey of $4.7~\\la\\,z~\\la\\,5.2$ quasar candidates, we \nhave discovered a quasar pair separated by 21\\arcsec, or about 135\\,kpc \nproper. In this paper, we discuss the discovery of this pair, our reasoning \nfor why it is a binary quasar (rather than a gravitational lens) and the \nimplications of such a pair for quasar clustering at $z\\sim5$. All quoted\nmagnitudes are on the AB system \\citep{OkeGunn83} and corrected for Galactic \nextinction using the dust maps of \\citet{Sch98}. We adopt a cosmology of \n($\\Omega_{\\rm m}, \\Omega_\\Lambda, \n h\\equiv H_0/100\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}) = \n (0.307,0.693,0.677)$ \nconsistent with recent results from {\\em Planck} \\citep[][]{Planck15}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\\label{sec:observations}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{colorsel}\n\\caption{Color-color plot displaying the color cuts used to select \n $z\\sim5$ quasar candidates (magenta line).

We are extending this work to fainter quasars using the \nCFHTLS-Wide survey \\citep{Gwyn12}. The full CFHTLS-Wide encompasses four fields \nwith a total area of 150~deg$^2$ and includes five optical bands, $ugriz$. We \ndownloaded the publicly available stacked images\\footnote{{\\url{http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/megapipe/cfhtls/index.html}}} and \ngenerated object catalogs using {SExtractor}\\ \\citep{sextractor}. The catalogs \ninclude PSF photometry derived from the {PSFEx}\\ models provided by the CFHTLS. \nWe included two of the CFHT-Wide fields in the selection described here; W1 at \n02:18~-07:00 and W3 at 14:18~+54:30.\n\nFull details of our faint $z\\sim5$ quasar selection will be provided in a \nfuture work. Briefly, we use the difference between the elliptical Kron \naperture magnitude (MAG\\_AUTO) flux measurements and the PSF flux measurement \n(MAG\\_PSF) from {SExtractor}\\ to obtain a rough star/galaxy separation. Through \nvarious tests we found that requiring \n${\\rm MAG\\_AUTO} - {\\rm MAG\\_PSF} > -0.15$ is highly complete to point sources \nto a limit of $i<23$, while greatly reducing contamination from compact \ngalaxies. We further apply a number of quality cuts. First, we require clean \nphotometry {SExtractor}\\ FLAGS $<=$ 4. Second, we remove objects lying within \nthe masked regions (generally due to bright stars) as provided by the CFHTLS; \nthis reduces our effective area by $\\sim1$\\%. Finally, we remove CFHTLS fields \nfor which the stellar locus is poorly matched to a reference locus derived from \nthe CFHTLS-Deep survey, indicating issues with the photometric calibration. \nThis reduces the areas of both W1 and W3 to 45~deg$^2$ (the full areas are \n72~deg$^2$ and 49~deg$^2$, respectively). \n\nAfter applying the morphological and quality cuts and a loose color cut\nof $r-i > 0.8$ the resulting density of objects is $\\sim$130~deg$^{-2}$\nin the two CFHTLS fields. In order to select $z\\sim5$ quasar candidates\nwe adapt the color criteria employed in \\citet{McGreer13} to account \nfor the bandpass differences between the SDSS and CFHT photometric systems.\nThis results in the following color cuts:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align*}\n  S/N(u) &< 2.2 \\\\\n  S/N(g) &< 2.2 ~~ {\\rm OR} ~~ g-r > 1.8 \\\\\n  r-i &> 1.3 \\\\\n  i-z &< 0.625((r-i) - 1.0) \\\\\n  i-z &< 0.55 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle S/N(u)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle&lt;2.2\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>2.2</mn></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle S/N(g)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex2.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle&lt;2.2~{}~{}{\\rm OR}~{}~{}g-r&gt;1.8\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+6.6pt\"><mn>2.2</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+6.6pt\"><mi>OR</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow><mo>&gt;</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>1.8</mn></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle r-i\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle&gt;1.3\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1.3</mn></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle i-z\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex4.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle&lt;0.625((r-i)-1.0)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>&lt;</mo><mrow><mn>0.625</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1.0</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle i-z\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex5.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle&lt;0.55\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0.55</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03056.tex", "nexttext": "\n\\noindent where we have adopted a power-law form of $\\xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\\gamma}$ \nwith $\\gamma=2$ for the slope of the correlation function, as used in many \nstudies of the clustering of quasars at high redshift on large and small scales \n\\citep[e.g.][]{She10,Whi12,Eft15}.\n\nAs it is unclear {\\it a priori} to what degree the redshift difference between the \ncomponents of our binary quasar is due to line-of-sight separation versus \ninfall, we will calculate ``minimum,'' ``medium'' and ``maximum'' separations \nbased on the transverse and line-of-sight comoving separations of our pair \n\\citep[again following][]{Sch00}. Our quasar pair is at $z=5.02$, is separated \nby 21\\arcsec\\ on the plane of the sky, and has a redshift difference of \n$\\Delta z \\la 0.03$. If the separation of the quasars is entirely in the \ntransverse direction, then  the components of our pair are separated by \n810\\,kpc comoving (the ``minimum'' separation). If the full redshift \ndifference is also due to physical separation, then the components of our pair \nare separated by 16.1\\,Mpc comoving (the ``maximum'' separation). If half of \nthe redshift difference is attributable to physical separation, then the \ncomponents of our pair are separated by 8.08\\,Mpc comoving (the ``medium'' \nseparation).\n\nIntegrating the \\citet{McGreer13} QLF to a limit of $i=23$ over the redshift\nrange $4.7<z<5.2$ results in a number density of \n$\\approx 1.75\\times10^{-7}\\, \\rm Mpc^{-3}$, ignoring selection completeness.\nOur ``minimum'' separation of 810\\,kpc implies a quasar pair embedded in a\nvolume of 2.25\\,Mpc$^{3}$. Multiplying this by the number density yields an \nexpectation of $3.9 \\times 10^{-7}$ quasars in the volume of interest. Assuming\na Poisson distribution, the probability of two quasars lying within this \nvolume is $7.3\\times 10^{-3}$ for an all-sky survey. As our survey only\nencompasses 90{\\,deg$^{2}$}, the odds of finding the binary quasar within our survey \nare 1 in 62{,}400, implying that this discovery would have been extremely \nunlikely in the absence of clustering. Substituting \n$N/N_{\\rm rand} = 62{,}400$ and $R = 810$\\,kpc into Eqn.~\\ref{schr} implies \n$r_0 = 117$\\,Mpc, or $r_0 = 74${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}.\n\nSimilar logic implies $r_0 = 25${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ for our ``medium'' separation case \nand $r_0 = 18${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ for our ``maximum'' separation case. Thus our \nexpectation is that $r_0 \\sim 25${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ for quasars at $z\\sim5$, with a \nlower-bound of $r_0 \\sim 18${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. If we adopt a shallower slope for the \npower law index the correlation length would need to be even greater; e.g.,\nfor $\\gamma=1.8$ the ``medium'' separation case results in \n$r_0 \\sim 33${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. Our measurement implies that the amplitude of quasar \nclustering at $z\\sim5$ is similar to that measured at $z\\sim4$ by \n\\citet{She07}.\n\n\\subsection{Estimating the Correlation Length Using the \\citet{Hen06} Formalism}\n\nThe \\citet{Sch00} formalism is simple and straightforward. However, by \nselecting ``minimum'' and ``maximum'' extremes for the distribution of \npeculiar velocities in the redshift-space direction this method ignores \nour expectation for this distribution. In particular, the ``minimum'' case\napplies if the two quasars are at the same distance and any redshift \ndifference is due to the local velocity field. This is a reasonable \nassumption in our case; however, it is useful to characterize the uncertainty\non that difference, and for that we turn to the method of \\citet{Hen06}. This\nmethod accounts for a realistic peculiar velocity distribution for the \nquasars so that we can place a more formal (Poisson) error on the correlation \nlength we infer from the existence of the binary.\n\nFollowing the method described in \\citet{Hen06}, we assume that binary \nquasars are well-described by a maximum possible peculiar velocity of \n$|v_{\\rm max}| =  2000${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}. We then project the redshift-space correlation\nfunction over this velocity interval,\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 28884, "prevtext": "\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{CFHT_RIZ}\n\\caption{Color image of {CFHTLS J0221-0342}\\ generated from the CFHTLS $riz$ images.

All \nobservations utilized a 1\\arcsec$\\times$180\\arcsec\\ longslit aligned at a \nposition angle of $-12.2^{\\circ}$ in order to capture both quasar candidates. \nThe objects were dispersed with the 270~mm$^{-1}$ grating at a \nresolution of $R\\sim640$. For the 2014 Jan 9 observations the central\nwavelength was set to 7500~\\AA, providing wavelength coverage from\n5670\\AA\\ to 9290\\AA, and the total integration time was 70\\,min.\nFor the 2014 Jan 10 and 2014 Aug 28 observations the central wavelength\nwas 8500\\AA~(6600\\AA\\ $\\la \\lambda \\la$ 1$\\mu$m) and the total \nintegration times were 45\\,min.\\ and 60\\,min., respectively. In all cases \nthe seeing was marginal (1{\\farcs}5 -- 2\\arcsec) with non-photometric \nconditions.\n\nThe spectra were processed in a standard fashion with Pyraf-based\nscripts; details of the processing method are given in \\citet{McGreer13}.\nWavelength calibration was provided by an internal HeNeAr lamp, and an\napproximate flux calibration was obtained from observations of the \nspectrophotometric standard star Feige 110. The calibrations were taken\nimmediately before the science spectra. The processed spectra from\neach of the three nights were interpolated onto a common linear wavelength\ngrid and combined using inverse-variance weighting. The final spectra\nare displayed in Figure~\\ref{fig:spectra}.\n\nThe spectroscopy immediately confirmed that both candidates are quasars \nat $z\\sim5$. In Section~\\ref{sec:pairorlens} we interpret the spectra and\nother available data in order to determine whether they represent two\nquasars at a similar redshift or gravitationally lensed images of a\nsingle source quasar.\n\nWe have obtained a total of 19 MMT spectra out of the 47 candidates with\n$i<23$ in W1 and W3. A more complete analysis of this sample will be \npresented in a future work. Relevant to this work, we note that {\\em all} \nof the observed objects are quasars at $z \\ga 4.5$, indicating that the\ncolor selection is highly pure. In addition, our simulations show that\nthe color selection is highly complete ($>90$\\%) in the range \n$4.75 < z \\la 5.15$, with a tail to $\\sim50\\%$ completeness out to $z\\sim5.4$ \n\\citep[see][for details on the simulation method]{McGreer13}. Although we\nhave spectra for only 40\\% of our candidates, we consider it highly\nlikely that any similar pair of small-separation quasars would be included\nin our target list, and thus we conclude that only one such pair lies within\nthe 90~deg$^2$ search area to the flux limit of $i<23$\\footnote{We searched\nour candidate list for additional pairs and found two quasars with a\nseparation of 80\\arcsec; however, they have a redshift difference of\n$\\Delta{z}=0.15$.}. This estimate of the area of our survey (90~deg$^2$) will \nbe used in \\S\\ref{sec:clustering} to infer the clustering strength of quasars \nat $z\\sim5$.\n\n\n\\subsection{Additional Observations}\n\n{CFHTLS J0221-0342}\\ lies within the XMM-LSS \\citep{xmmlss} survey region, and thus has a \nwide array of multiwavelength observations. Table~\\ref{tab:photometry} lists \nphotometric observations of the quasar pair, including deep near-IR photometry \nfrom the UKIDSS Deep eXtragalactic Survey \\citep[DXS;][]{ukidss} and deep \nSpitzer photometry from the SWIRE survey \\citep{swire}. \nThe brighter quasar is also an X-ray source in the XMM-XXL survey and was \nincluded as an ancillary quasar target in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 \\citep{DR12}. This ancillary \nprogram\\footnote{{\\url{http://www.sdss.org/dr12/algorithms/ancillary/boss/xmmfollowup/}}} targeted XMM-XXL sources for spectroscopy; \n{QSO-A}\\ was the highest redshift X-ray source in the sample, with a redshift \nof $z=5.011$.\n\nIt is important to note that although {CFHTLS J0221-0342}\\ happens to lie within a deep \nextragalactic survey field, for our survey it was selected based on optical \ncolors from the CFHTLS-Wide alone. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{J0221ABsed}\n\\caption{SEDs for {QSO-A}\\ and {QSO-B}\\ obtained from the CFHTLS-Wide imaging\n ($griz$; the $g$-band measurements are below the plot boundary in the upper\n panel), UKIDSS DXS ($JK$), and Spitzer/SWIRE (3.6$\\mu$m and 4.5$\\mu$m).\n The upper panel compares the photometric measurements for the two objects;\n the SED for QSO-A is shifted downward so that the $\\chi^2$ difference\n between the two SEDs is minimized.

Because lensing \nis achromatic, if they are lensed images the two objects should present \nsimilar colors at all wavelengths. There are two important effects that can\naffect the observed colors: 1) differential reddening along the independent \nlight paths to the two images, and 2) time delays between the lensed images\ncombined with intrinsic source variability. Figure~\\ref{fig:seds} presents\nthe multiwavelength SEDs of {CFHTLS J0221-0342}, where deviations as large as\n$\\sim$30\\% from the mean flux offset are present across a wide range of\nwavelengths. These differences are far greater than the photometric \nuncertainties, which are $<1$\\% from $g$-band to $K$-band. The statistical\nuncertainties are appropriate here since the photometry represents \n{\\em relative} flux measurements between the two objects, as the same \ncalibrations have been applied to both objects. In addition, because of their \nproximity, the photometry of the two objects is always simultaneous, \nminimizing any differences arising from intrinsic source variability. We apply \nthe $\\chi^2$ statistic given by  \\citet[][their equation 2]{Hen06} to the two \nSEDs as a test of the hypothesis that a simple flux scaling combined with \nphotometric scatter accounts for their differences (i.e., they are lensed \nimages) and rule this out at high significance, obtaining $\\chi^2/\\nu$ = 223/7 \nfrom the multiwavelength SEDs\\footnote{\\citet{Hen06} obtain a median value of \n$\\chi^2/\\nu$ = 33.1/4 for a sample of SDSS quasars at $2.4 < z < 2.45$; the \nexpectation for lensed images in the absence of differential reddening is \n$\\chi^2/\\nu \\sim 1$. To compute this value we use the photometry from $g$ \nthrough 4.5$\\mu$m where both objects are well detected, hence the 7 degrees of \nfreedom. If we restrict the data to the $griz$ bands to better compare with \nthe SDSS data, we obtain $\\chi^2/\\nu$ = 212/3.}. Finally, there is no trend in \nthe flux differences that would be consistent with reddening.\n\nThe MMT spectra of the two objects are highly similar to the level of the \n$S/N$ and resolution available. We obtain a small redshift difference from \nfitting the \\ion{O}{1} emission line in the MMT spectra; Gaussian fits with \nthe IRAF {\\it splot} command return $z({\\rm A})=5.016$ and $z({\\rm B})=5.019$, \na difference of $\\approx160${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}. However, the \\ion{O}{1} line is weakly \ndetected in the {QSO-B}\\ spectrum and the uncertainty on the line centroid is \n$\\approx 300${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}, thus this difference is not significant. The Ly$\\alpha$ \nlines are detected at high $S/N$ in both spectra and the line profiles in the \nwings are nearly identical (Fig.~\\ref{fig:lyacompare}), agreeing to within \ntwo spectral pixels, or $\\la270${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}. As it is difficult to conclusively\nstate the velocity offset between the two spectra, in the rest of this work\nwe adopt the difference obtained from the \\ion{O}{1} fits, \n$\\Delta{z} \\la 0.03$.\n\nThere are differences between the two spectra that indicate they are not \nlikely to originate from a single source quasar. {QSO-B}\\ has a clear absorption \nfeature just blueward of Ly$\\alpha$ at $\\sim$7286\\AA\\ while {QSO-A}\\ has a \ntransmission peak at $\\sim$7170\\AA; both of these features are significantly \nweaker in the opposite spectrum (Figure~\\ref{fig:lyacompare}). Also, the \n\\ion{N}{5} emission from {QSO-A}\\ is greater than that from {QSO-B}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\epsscale{1.15}\n\\plotone{J0221_lyacompare}\n\\caption{Ly$\\alpha$ emission line profiles for {QSO-A}\\ (blue) and {QSO-B}\\ \n (dark gray).

The Ly$\\alpha$ emission from {QSO-A}\\ has\n larger equivalent width, as does the \\ion{N}{5} emission line at\n 7440\\AA\\ (note that the {QSO-B}\\ spectrum has a redder continuum slope, \n consistent with its redder $r-i$ color, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:colors}).\n The Ly$\\alpha$ emission of {QSO-B}\\ has stronger absorption\n features. The wings of the two lines are nearly identical, indicating\n that the velocity offset is extremely small; it is $\\la 2$ pixels or\n $\\la 270~{\\rm km}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$.\n \\label{fig:lyacompare}} \n\\end{figure}\n\nAnother consideration is that a configuration that produces a large separation \n(21\\arcsec) image pair of a $z=5$ quasar is highly unlikely; only three\nlarge-separation lensed quasar systems are known in the entire SDSS \n\\citep{Inada03,Dahle13,Rusu13}. Large separations can arise from group- or \ncluster-scale lens masses. For this configuration, the peak in the expected \nlens redshift distribution is at $z\\sim0.7$ and the probability of a source \nquasar at $z=5$ with an image separation $>20$\\arcsec\\ is extremely small \n\\citep{Hen07,Li07}. Furthermore, the CFHTLS imaging is sufficiently deep that \na group-scale overdensity at $z<1$ should be immediately apparent in the \noptical imaging, but as Figure~\\ref{fig:colorim} shows, there are no galaxies \ndetected between {QSO-A}\\ and {QSO-B}, and no obvious overdensity of galaxies in \nthe vicinity.\n\nIn conclusion, the mismatched SEDs of the two objects and the lack of any\nobvious foreground mass to generate a wide separation lens configuration\nstrongly argue against the lens hypothesis for this pair of objects. We\nproceed to interpret them as a binary quasar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Implications for Quasar Clustering at $z > 5$}\n\\label{sec:clustering}\n\nQuasars peak as a luminous population near $z\\sim2.5$, and bright quasars at higher redshift are increasingly\nrare \\citep{Ric06}. Combining the depth and area necessary\nto survey large numbers of $z\\sim5$ quasars is therefore taxing. Due to the difficulty in studying a significant\nquantity of\nquasars at high redshift, quasar clustering has only been measured in a statistical fashion out to $z\\sim4$, by \\citet{She07}, who found\na correlation length of $r_{\\rm 0} \\sim24${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. This level of clustering is considered ``large,'' in the sense that\nit is at the limits of what might be predicted by theoretical models that use the luminosity function to infer quasar clustering \\citep[e.g.][]{Hop07}\nand in the sense that clustering measurements at $z\\sim2.5$ typically obtain significantly smaller values of \n$r_{\\rm 0} \\sim8${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ \\citep[e.g.][]{Whi12,Eft15}. That $r_{\\rm 0}$ seems large at\n$z\\sim4$ motivates further measurements of quasar clustering to determine if $r_{\\rm 0}$ remains large\nat comparable or higher redshifts.\n\nA small number of close quasar pairs can be used as an alternative method\nfor quantifying the clustering of high redshift quasars. In the absence\nof clustering it would be extraordinarily unlikely to find multiple quasars \nwithin a small cosmological volume, hence pairs can be used to infer the \nclustering strength required to increase the likelihood of companion quasars\nwith small separations.\nAn example of this approach is that of \\citet{Sch00}, who used a single binary quasar at $z=4.25$ separated by $\\Delta\\theta=33.4$\\arcsec\\ on \nthe plane of the sky to infer $r_{\\rm 0} \\sim12$--30\\,Mpc for the correlation length of $z\\sim4$ quasars, presaging the \n \\citet{She07} estimate of $r_{\\rm 0} \\sim24${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. In our chosen cosmology, the transverse projected separation of the \\citet{Sch00}\nquasar pair is 160{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ compared to 90{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ ($\\Delta\\theta=21$\\arcsec; $z=5.02$) for the pair we have discovered. \n\nIn this section we use our binary quasar to estimate $r_{\\rm 0}$ for quasars at $z\\sim5$. It may be helpful \nto remember that at $z=5$, an angle of 1\\arcsec\\ subtends a transverse separation of 26{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ comoving (4.35{$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}$}\\ proper).\n\n\n\\subsection{The luminosity function}\\label{qlf}\n\nThe significance of observing a close pair of quasars relative to random\nchance is determined from the QLF. We adopt the recent measurement of the QLF \nat $z=5$ from \\citet{McGreer13} based on quasars drawn from the SDSS Stripe 82 \nregion, extending to a depth of $i=22$. Although {CFHTLS J0221-0342}\\ is drawn from a \ndeeper survey ($i<23$) and thus requires extrapolation from the \n\\citet{McGreer13} results, it is worth noting that both quasars have $i<22$ \nand are thus within the range of the Stripe 82 measurement.\n\nThe QLF is typically fit with a double power-law form,\n\\begin {equation}\\label{phi}\n\\Phi(M,z)=\\frac{\\Phi^{*}(z)}{10^{0.4(\\alpha+1)(M-M^{*})}+10^{0.4(\\beta+1)(M-M^{*})}} ~.\n\\end{equation} \n\\citet{McGreer13} estimate the characteristic luminosity to be \n$M^{*}=-27.21$ and the faint and bright end slopes to be $\\alpha=-2.03$ and \n$\\beta=-4.0$, respectively. The parameter $\\Phi^{*}$ is best described by \na term that evolves with redshift, \n$\\log \\Phi^{*}(z)=\\log \\Phi^{*}(z=6)+k(z-6)$, with \n$\\log \\Phi^{*}(z=6)=-8.94$ and $\\rm k=-0.47$ (see \\S 6 of \\citealt{McGreer13} \nfor a detailed discussion on the fitting procedure and redshift evolution of \nthe QLF parameters). \n\nAs noted in \\S\\ref{sec:observations}, our survey of $z\\sim5$ quasars has \nprogressed such that it is reasonable to assume our binary quasar is drawn \nfrom a complete survey covering 90{\\,deg$^{2}$}\\ to a flux limit of $i < 23$. The \nnumber density of quasars brighter than $i'=23$ in our survey is calculated \nby taking  the integral of the QLF between the $k$-corrected absolute \nmagnitudes,  $M_{i}^{\\rm bright}$ and $M_{i'}$, corresponding to the bright \nand faint end of the apparent magnitude range of our survey:\n\\begin {equation}\\label{phist}\nn(z,i<i')=\\int_{M_{i}^{\\rm bright}}^{M_{i'}} dM_{i} ~ \\Phi(M_{i},z).\n\\end{equation} \n\nWe use a constant $k$-correction of $k_{\\rm corr}=-2.2$, which is reasonable \nover the full redshift range of interest \\citep[see Fig.\\ 6 of][]{McGreer13}.\nThe number densities obtained from the QLF are relatively insensitive to the \nbright limit (in apparent magnitude) adopted for the integration. We ignore\nthe incompleteness due to our selection efficiency, which would reduce the \nobserved number densities. We stress that this makes our measurements more\nconservative, in that any incompleteness in our survey would {\\em increase}\nthe inferred clustering signal, as we would be more likely to have missed\nadditional close pairs. The QLF predicts $\\sim0.9${\\,deg$^{2}$}\\ quasars over the \nredshift range $4.7<z<5.2$, which already hints that a quasar pair separated \nby 21\\arcsec\\ at $z\\sim5$ would be highly unusual if quasars were not\nsignificantly clustered at high redshift.\n \n\n\\subsection{Estimating the Correlation Length Using the \\citet{Sch00} Formalism}\\label{clsres}\n\nFollowing \\citet{Sch00} we determine the correlation length of quasars by \ncomparing the single pair we have found to the number of pairs we would \nexpect to find in the volume enclosing our pair. The mean number expected in \na given volume can be determined from the QLF. The odds of finding two quasars \nin that volume (corresponding to our binary quasar) can then be determined \nfrom the Poisson distribution, as Poisson statistics are an excellent model \nfor quasar clustering on small scales where the pairs are independent \n\\citep[e.g.][]{Mye06}. The correlation length can be related to the excess \nclustering over random as\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{multline}\\label{schr}\n  \\frac{N}{N_{\\rm rand}}=\n     \\frac{\\int_{0}^{R} 4\\pi r^2 \\xi(r)~dr}{\\int_{0}^{R}4{\\pi}r^2~dr} \\\\\n     = \\frac{3}{3-\\gamma}\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)^{-\\gamma}|_{\\gamma=2}\n     = 3\\left(\\frac{R}{r_0}\\right)^{-2} \\ ,\n\\end{multline}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\frac{N}{N_{\\rm rand}}=\\frac{\\int_{0}^{R}4\\pi r^{2}\\xi(r)~{}dr}{%&#10;\\int_{0}^{R}4{\\pi}r^{2}~{}dr}\\\\&#10;\\displaystyle=\\frac{3}{3-\\gamma}\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right)^{-\\gamma}|_{%&#10;\\gamma=2}=3\\left(\\frac{R}{r_{0}}\\right)^{-2}\\ ,\" display=\"block\"><mtable displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mfrac><mi>N</mi><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>rand</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mi>R</mi></msubsup><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03be</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mi>R</mi></msubsup><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"right\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>R</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><mo fence=\"true\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>R</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03056.tex", "nexttext": " \n\\noindent where $H(z)$ is the expansion rate at redshift $z$ and $\\xi_{s}$ \nis the redshift-space quasar correlation function.

Our quasar pair is at $z=5.02$, is separated \nby 21\\arcsec\\ on the plane of the sky, and has a redshift difference of \n$\\Delta z \\la 0.03$. If the separation of the quasars is entirely in the \ntransverse direction, then  the components of our pair are separated by \n810\\,kpc comoving (the ``minimum'' separation). If the full redshift \ndifference is also due to physical separation, then the components of our pair \nare separated by 16.1\\,Mpc comoving (the ``maximum'' separation).

Multiplying this by the number density yields an \nexpectation of $3.9 \\times 10^{-7}$ quasars in the volume of interest. Assuming\na Poisson distribution, the probability of two quasars lying within this \nvolume is $7.3\\times 10^{-3}$ for an all-sky survey. As our survey only\nencompasses 90{\\,deg$^{2}$}, the odds of finding the binary quasar within our survey \nare 1 in 62{,}400, implying that this discovery would have been extremely \nunlikely in the absence of clustering. Substituting \n$N/N_{\\rm rand} = 62{,}400$ and $R = 810$\\,kpc into Eqn.~\\ref{schr} implies \n$r_0 = 117$\\,Mpc, or $r_0 = 74${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}.\n\nSimilar logic implies $r_0 = 25${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ for our ``medium'' separation case \nand $r_0 = 18${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ for our ``maximum'' separation case. Thus our \nexpectation is that $r_0 \\sim 25${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ for quasars at $z\\sim5$, with a \nlower-bound of $r_0 \\sim 18${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. If we adopt a shallower slope for the \npower law index the correlation length would need to be even greater; e.g.,\nfor $\\gamma=1.8$ the ``medium'' separation case results in \n$r_0 \\sim 33${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. Our measurement implies that the amplitude of quasar \nclustering at $z\\sim5$ is similar to that measured at $z\\sim4$ by \n\\citet{She07}.\n\n\\subsection{Estimating the Correlation Length Using the \\citet{Hen06} Formalism}\n\nThe \\citet{Sch00} formalism is simple and straightforward. However, by \nselecting ``minimum'' and ``maximum'' extremes for the distribution of \npeculiar velocities in the redshift-space direction this method ignores \nour expectation for this distribution. In particular, the ``minimum'' case\napplies if the two quasars are at the same distance and any redshift \ndifference is due to the local velocity field. This is a reasonable \nassumption in our case; however, it is useful to characterize the uncertainty\non that difference, and for that we turn to the method of \\citet{Hen06}. This\nmethod accounts for a realistic peculiar velocity distribution for the \nquasars so that we can place a more formal (Poisson) error on the correlation \nlength we infer from the existence of the binary.\n\nFollowing the method described in \\citet{Hen06}, we assume that binary \nquasars are well-described by a maximum possible peculiar velocity of \n$|v_{\\rm max}| =  2000${\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}. We then project the redshift-space correlation\nfunction over this velocity interval,\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{wp}\nw_p(R,z)=\\int_{-v_{\\rm max}/aH(z)}^{v_{\\rm max}/aH(z)} \\xi_{s}(R, s, z) ds ~,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"w_{p}(R,z)=\\int_{-v_{\\rm max}/aH(z)}^{v_{\\rm max}/aH(z)}\\xi_{s}(R,s,z)ds~{},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>max</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>max</mi></msub><mo>/</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></msubsup><mrow><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>R</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>s</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03056.tex", "nexttext": "\n\\noindent where $V_{\\rm shell}$, the volume of a cylindrical shell in \nredshift space, is given by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 33982, "prevtext": " \n\\noindent where $H(z)$ is the expansion rate at redshift $z$ and $\\xi_{s}$ \nis the redshift-space quasar correlation function.

By \nvarying the correlation length in Eqn.~\\ref{wpbarfinal} we obtain a \nrange of model values for the number of companions we expect at a separation \nof 21\\arcsec\\ within our survey volume at $z=5.02$. We then compare the\npredicted number of companions to the discovery of a single binary out of \na sample of 47 quasar candidates,\\footnote{We ignore the fact that we do \nnot have spectroscopic confirmation for all of our candidates. First, as \nmentioned in \\S\\ref{sec:mmtspec}, we consider our survey to be highly \ncomplete to small-separation pairs. Second, our spectroscopy has shown \nthat our color selection is highly pure, so that we expect nearly all of \nthe 47 candidates to be $z\\sim5$ quasars. It is more conservative to use \nthe full candidate sample, as including only the objects with spectroscopy \nwould greatly {\\em increase} the implied clustering signal. In addition, \nthe binary reported here was prioritized for observation, so it is \nmore correct to adopt the full sample.} i.e., within our sample of 47 \nquasars there are two objects within the cylindrical shell defined by \n$V_{\\rm shell}$. Thus we are seeking a model for the correlation function \nthat results in the expected number of companions to be \n$N_c = 2/47 = 0.04255$.\n\nWe find the correlation length that best describes our binary quasar is \n$86${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}, with a 1$\\sigma$ lower bound of $25${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}. The lower bound\nhas been determined using the confidence interval for a single measurement \nprovided by \\citet{Geh86}.\n\nAs with the analysis in \\S\\ref{clsres}, this result depends on our \nadopted QLF and that our assumed form of the correlation function is valid \nand non-evolving across our redshift range of interest. In particular, in\ncalculating an $r_0$ that is significantly larger than the scales probed\nby our pair, we are implicitly assuming that clustering at small scales \ncan be extrapolated to large scales\\footnote{It is worth noting that the\nprojected separation of our binary is just at the scale at which the two-halo\nterm begins to contribute to the projected correlation function in the HOD\nmodels of \\citet{Kayo+12}; see their Fig.~6.} (as was found to be the case \nfor low-$z$ quasars by \\citealt{Kayo+12} and consistent with results at \n$z\\sim3\\mbox{--}4$ from \\citealt{She10}). Whether we employ the \\citet{Hen06} \nformalism or the \\citet{Sch00} formalism, we find that the existence of this \nbinary quasar implies a correlation length $r_0 > 20${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}, consistent with \nthe $r_0 \\sim 25${$h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$}\\ measured at $z\\sim4$ by \\citet{She07}. This strongly \nsuggests that quasars are at least as clustered at $z\\sim5$ as has been found \nat $z\\sim4$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\nWe have discovered a pair of quasars with apparently identical redshifts of\n$z=5.02$ and a separation of 21\\arcsec\\ on the sky. A number of factors \nargue against the pair being gravitationally lensed images of a single \nsource quasar. These include differences in spectral profiles and SED \nshapes, and the fact that no deflector is present between the two quasars \nin relatively deep optical imaging. Assuming the quasar pair is a binary, \nthe small projected separation (135 kpc proper) and lack of a clear redshift \noffset implies their physical separation is quite small, within a factor of \n$\\sim2\\mbox{--}3$ of the virial radius of a typical quasar-hosting dark matter \nhalo at high redshift \n\\citep[$\\sim 10^{12}\\mbox{--}10^{13}~M_\\sun$,][]{Hop07,She07,Whi12,Eft15}. \nThis single detection of a binary at $z=5$ favors models where quasars are \nstrongly clustered at high redshift, at least on small scales.\n\nThe clustering of quasars is sensitive not only to the triggering \nmechanism(s), but also feedback effects that terminate black hole growth.\nGlobally, the quasar population experiences a ``downsizing'' trend at\n$z\\la3$, as activity shifts to lower mass and lower luminosity systems\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Ross+13}.\nThis is often thought to be due to feedback, as the most massive systems\nform early but rapidly shut down after their quasar phase, freezing their\nblack hole mass while the host halos continue to grow. At high redshift\nthe picture is murkier, with few constraints on the black hole mass and\nEddington ratio distributions. This is demonstrated by \\citet{Hop07}, who\ncompare three disparate models for the continued growth of black holes at\nhigh redshift after their luminous quasar phase. If feedback is efficient\nat high redshift, the correlation length should decrease strongly with\nincreasing redshift. If feedback is inefficient such that the black holes \ngrow continuously until $z\\sim2$, the correlation length flattens out at \nhigh redshift. If quasars grow at the same rate as their host halos at $z>3$ \n(the ``maximal'' growth model), the correlation length rises sharply, \nimplying that quasars at $z=5$ are more strongly clustered by a factor of a \nfew compared to the measurements at $z\\sim2.5$.\n\nWhile repeating the caveat that we have only measured small-scale clustering \nfrom a single, high-luminosity binary at $z=5$, this observation is most \nconsistent with a large correlation length, favoring the models in which \nfeedback is highly inefficient. Indeed, \\citet{Willott+10} find that the \nEddington ratios of $z\\sim6$ quasars are near unity across a range of \nluminosities, suggesting that fainter quasars are not in a ``decaying'' phase\nof black hole growth. \n\nIt is surprising to have found two highly luminous quasars --- presumably \npowered by $>10^8~M_\\sun$ black holes and situated in massive dark matter \nhalos --- in such close proximity at this redshift. Previous searches have \nrelied on wide-area surveys such as the SDSS, whereas we surveyed only \n$\\sim0.1$\\%\\ of the sky and yet discovered a $z=5$ binary quasar {\\em bright \nenough to have been selected from SDSS imaging}. Whether this was simply\na chance find will await a more comprehensive search for quasar pairs at\n$z \\ga 5$.\n\nMeasurements of high-redshift quasar clustering on large scales are crucial to \ndiscriminating between feedback models and better understanding the early \ngrowth of the most massive black holes in the universe. Such measurements are \njust possible today with wide-area, medium-depth fields such as SDSS Stripe 82 \nand the CFHTLS, and ongoing surveys such as the DES, the DESI Imaging Surveys \n(DECaLS, BASS, and MzLS), and KIDS also provide the requisite combination of \ndepth and area. Obtaining a fully three-dimensional clustering measurement \ndemands a considerable investment in spectroscopic follow-up given the low sky \ndensity; however, if quasars do cluster strongly at high redshift (as implied \nby our observations), a dense survey over a relatively small area could \nproduce a statistically meaningful result.\n\n\\vspace{24pt}\nIDM and XF acknowledge support from NSF grants 11-06682 and NSF 15-15115.\nADM and SE were supported in part by NASA ADAP award NNX12AE38G and by NSF \nawards 12-11112 and 15-15404.\nThis research made use of Astropy, a community-developed core Python package \nfor Astronomy \\citep{astropy}.\nObservations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint \nfacility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.\nAlso based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.
