A transversal in $H$ is\na subset of vertices in $H$ that has a nonempty intersection with\nevery edge of $H$. A vertex hits an edge if it belongs to that edge.\nThe transversal game played on $H$ involves of two players,\n\\emph{Edge-hitter} and \\emph{Staller}, who take turns choosing a\nvertex from $H$. Each vertex chosen must hit at least one edge not\nhit by the vertices previously chosen. The game ends when the set of\nvertices chosen becomes a transversal in $H$. Edge-hitter wishes to\nminimize the number of vertices chosen in the game, while Staller wishes\nto maximize it. The \\emph{game transversal number}, $\\tau_g(H)$, of\n$H$ is the number of vertices chosen when Edge-hitter starts the\ngame and both players play optimally.\n\nWe compare the game transversal number of a hypergraph\n with its transversal number, and also\n present an important fact concerning the monotonicity of $\\tau_g$,\n that we call the Transversal Continuation Principle.\n\n\n\n\nIt is known that if $H$ is a hypergraph with all edges of size at\nleast~$2$,  and $H$ is not a $4$-cycle, then $\\tau_g(H) \\le\n\\frac{4}{11}({n_{_H}}+{m_{_H}})$;  and if $H$ is a (loopless) graph, then\n$\\tau_g(H) \\le \\frac{1}{3}({n_{_H}} + {m_{_H}} + 1)$.

A \\emph{hypergraph} $H = (V(H),E(H))$ is a\nfinite set $V(H)$ of elements, called \\emph{vertices}, together with\na finite multiset $E(H)$ of nonempty subsets of $V(H)$, called\n\\emph{hyperedges} or simply \\emph{edges}. If the hypergraph $H$ is\nclear from the context, we may write $V = V(H)$ and $E = E(H)$. We\nshall use the notation ${n_{_H}} =|V(H)|$ and ${m_{_H}}=|E(H)|$, and sometimes\njust $n$ and $m$ without subscript if the actual $H$ need not be\nemphasized, to denote the {order} and the {size} of $H$,\nrespectively.  We say that two edges in $H$ \\emph{overlap} if\nthey intersect in at least two vertices. A   hypergraph is\n\\emph{linear} if it has no overlapping edges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $k$-\\emph{edge} in $H$ is an edge of cardinality~$k$.  The\nhypergraph $H$ is said to be $k$-\\emph{uniform} if every edge of $H$\nis a $k$-edge. Every loopless graph is a $2$-uniform hypergraph.\nThus graphs are special hypergraphs. The \\emph{degree} of a vertex\n$v$ in $H$, denoted by $d_H(v)$,\n\n is the number of edges of $H$ which contain $v$.\n The maximum degree among the vertices of $H$ is denoted by $\\Delta(H)$.\n\n\nTwo vertices $x$ and $y$ of $H$ are \\emph{adjacent} if there is an\nedge $e$  of $H$ such that $\\{x,y\\}\\subseteq e$. The\n\\emph{neighborhood} of a vertex $v$ in $H$, denoted $N_H(v)$ or\nsimply $N(v)$ if $H$ is clear from the context, is the set of all\nvertices different from $v$ that are adjacent to $v$. A vertex in\n$N(v)$ is a \\emph{neighbor} of $v$.\n\n\nA subset $T$ of vertices in a hypergraph $H$ is a \\emph{transversal}\n(also called  \\emph{hitting set} or \\emph{vertex cover} or\n\\emph{blocking set} in many papers) if $T$ has a nonempty\nintersection with every edge of $H$. A vertex \\emph{hits} or\n\\emph{covers} an edge if it belongs to that edge.  The\n\\emph{transversal number} ${\\mbox{$\\tau({H})$}}$ of $H$ is the minimum size of a\ntransversal in $H$.  In hypergraph theory the concept of transversal\nis  fundamental and well studied. The major monograph \\cite{Berge89}\nof hypergraph theory gives a detailed introduction to this topic. We\nrefer to~\\cite{BuHeTu12,BuHeTuYe14,DoHe14,HeLo12,HeLo14,HeYe13,\nHeYe13b,LoWa13}\n for recent results and further references.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{The Game Transversal Number.} The transversal game\nbelongs to the   growing family of \\emph{competitive optimization}\ngraph and hypergraph games. Competitive optimization variants of\ncoloring~\\cite{Bod91,DZ99,Gar81,KK09,KT94,TZ15},\nlist-colouring~\\cite{BST07,Sch09,Zhu09}, matching~\\cite{CKOW13},\ndomination~\\cite{BKR10,KWZ-2013}, total\ndomination~\\cite{hkr-2015,hkr-2015+}, disjoint\ndomination~\\cite{BuTu15}, Ramsey theory~\\cite{BGKMSW11,GHK04,GKP08},\nand more~\\cite{BKP14} have been extensively investigated.\n\n\n\nThe transversal game played on a hypergraph $H$ involves two\nplayers, \\emph{Edge-hitter} and \\emph{Staller}, who take turns\nchoosing a vertex from $H$. Each vertex chosen must hit at least one\nedge not hit by the vertices previously chosen. We call such a\nchosen vertex a \\emph{legal move} in the transversal game. The game\nends when the set of vertices chosen becomes a transversal in $H$.\nEdge-hitter wishes to end the game with the smallest possible\n  number of vertices\nchosen, and Staller wishes to end the game with as many vertices\nchosen as possible. The \\emph{game transversal number} (resp.\\\n\\emph{Staller-start game transversal number}), $\\tau_g(H)$ (resp.\\\n$\\tau_g'(H)$), of $H$ is the number of vertices\n\nchosen when Edge-hitter (resp.\\ Staller) starts the game and both\nplayers play  optimally.\n\n\n\nA \\emph{partially covered hypergraph} is a hypergraph  together with\na declaration that some edges are already covered; that is, they\nneed not be covered in the rest of the game.\n Once an edge has been covered, it plays no role\nin the remainder of the game and can be deleted from the partially\ncovered hypergraph, as can all isolated vertices.\n   Therefore, after those deletions we obtain a hypergraph\n    being equivalent, from the transversal game viewpoint,\n    to the partially covered hypergraph\n    from which it has been derived;\n     we call it a \\emph{residual hypergraph}.\n  We will also say that the original hypergraph $H$,\nbefore any move has been made in the game, is a residual\n  (and also partially covered)\n hypergraph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven a hypergraph $H$ and a subset $S$ of edges of $H$,  we denote\nby $H|S$ the residual hypergraph\\footnote{In the context of games\n we prefer to use the notation $H|S$, although its edge set coincides\n  with that of the hypergraph denoted by $H-S$ in many\n   hypergraph-theoretic papers.}\n   in which the edges contained in $S$ do not appear anymore.\n We use ${\\tau_g}(H|S)$ (resp.\\ ${\\tau_g^\\prime}(H|S)$)\nto denote the number of turns remaining in the transversal game on\n$H|S$ under optimal play when {Edge-hitter } (resp.\\ Staller) has the next\nturn.\n\n We will use the standard notation $[k] = \\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$.\n\n\n\n\\section{Known Results}\n\nLet $H_1$ be the hypergraph with vertex set $V(H_1) =\n\\{x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2,y_4\\}$  and edge set $E(H_1) =\n\\{\\{x_1,x_2,x_3\\},  \\{y_1,y_2,y_3\\}, \\{x_1,y_1\\}, \\{x_2,y_2\\},\n\\{x_3,y_3\\}\\}$.

We state\nthis fact formally as follows.\n\n\n\\begin{ob}\nFor every hypergraph $H$, the following holds. \\\\\n\\indent {\\rm (a)} $\\tau(H) \\le {\\tau_g}(H) \\le 2\\tau(H)-1 $. \\\\\n\\indent {\\rm (b)} $\\tau(H) \\le {\\tau_g^\\prime}(H) \\le 2\\tau(H)$.\n\\label{obser1}\n\\end{ob}\n\n\n It is easy to see that the equalities\n$\\tau(H) = {\\tau_g}(H) = {\\tau_g^\\prime}(H)$ hold if $H$  is the disjoint\nunion of complete $k$-uniform hypergraphs. Further,\n$\\tau_g(H)=2\\tau(H)-1$ and ${\\tau_g^\\prime}(H)=2\\tau(H)$ are valid if\n$\\tau(H) = 1$ and $H$ contains at least two different edges. In\nSection~\\ref{S:family} we present an infinite family of hypergraphs\n$H$ with $\\tau_g(H) = 2\\tau(H)-1$ and $\\tau_g'(H)= 2\\tau(H)$. These\nshow that the lower and upper bounds given in Observation\n\\ref{obser1} cannot be improved even when $\\tau(H)$ is large.\n\nWe next present a  simple but fundamental and widely applicable\n lemma, named the \\emph{Transversal Continuation\nPrinciple}, that expresses the monotonicity of ${\\tau_g}$ and\n ${\\tau_g^\\prime}$ with respect to subhypergraphs.\n Its proof is given in Section~\\ref{S:TCP}.\n\n\\begin{lem}\n\\label{lem:continuation}\n{\\rm (Transversal Continuation Principle)}\nLet $H$ be a hypergraph and let $A,B \\subseteq E(H)$.  If $B \\subseteq A$, then ${\\tau_g}(H|A) \\le {\\tau_g}(H|B)$ and ${\\tau_g^\\prime}(H|A) \\le {\\tau_g^\\prime}(H|B)$.\n\\end{lem}\n\nLet us mention without quoting the formal definitions that in any graph $G$ the\n dominating sets are in one-to-one correspondence with the transversals of the\n hypergraph whose edges are the closed neighborhoods of the vertices in $G$;\n and similarly, the total dominating sets in a graph without isolated vertices\n  are in one-to-one correspondence with the transversals of the\n   open neighborhoods of the vertices.\n (These facts are immediate by definition.)\nIn this way our Transversal Continuation Principle includes, as particular\n cases, the assertions called `Continuation Principle' for the domination\n game in \\cite{KWZ-2013} and for the total domination game in \\cite{hkr-2015},\n hence putting them on a higher level of generality.\n\nAs another consequence of the Transversal Continuation Principle,  the\nnumber of moves in the Edge-hitter-start transversal game and the\nStaller-start transversal game when played optimally can differ by\nat most one.

In this\nsection, we present an infinite family of hypergraphs $H$ with\n${\\tau_g}(H) = 2\\tau(H)-1$ and  ${\\tau_g^\\prime}(H)= 2\\tau(H)$. For this\npurpose, we define a \\emph{$k$-corona} of a hypergraph $H$  to be a\nhypergraph obtained by attaching $k$ hyperedges (each of size at\nleast~$2$) to each vertex of $H$, where the hyperedges attached to a\nvertex $v \\in V(H)$ contain only degree-$1$ vertices apart from~$v$.\n\n\\begin{prop}\nFor every positive integer $k$ and for every hypergraph $H$ of order\nat most $2^{k-1}-1$, every $k$-corona $H^k$ of $H$ satisfies\n$\\tau_g(H^k) = 2\\tau(H^k)-1$ and ${\\tau_g^\\prime}(H^k) = 2\\tau(H^k)$.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nLet us denote the vertices of $H$ by $v_1, \\dots, v_n$ and the\nhyperedges attached to $v_i$ by $e(1,i), \\dots, e(k,i)$. By our\nassumption, $n <2^{k-1}$. Since $\\tau(H^k)=n$, the inequalities\n$\\tau_g(H^k)\\le 2n-1$ and $ {\\tau_g^\\prime}(H^k) \\le 2n$ are valid by\nObservation~\\ref{obser1}.\n  Therefore, it suffices to prove that\nStaller has a strategy to achieve at least $2n-1$ turns if\nEdge-hitter starts the game, and at least $2n$ turns if Staller\nstarts.\n\nFirst, we associate a weight ${\\rm w}(e)$ with each hyperedge $e$ of\n$H^k$ as follows. If $e$ is a hyperedge of $H$, then we let ${\\rm w}(e) =\n0$. If $e = e(j,i)$ is a hyperedge attached to $H$ for some $j \\in\n[k]$ and $i \\in [n]$, then we let ${\\rm w}(e) = 2^{j-1}$. As the game is\nplayed, when a hyperedge is hit by a played vertex, the weight of\nsuch a hyperedge becomes zero. Hence, if ${\\rm w}(H^k)$ denotes the sum\nof the weights of the edges in the residual hypergraph $H^k$, then\nthe game starts with\n", "index": 1, "text": "\n\\[\n{\\rm w}(H^k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^k 2^{j-1} = n(2^k-1),\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\rm w}(H^{k})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{k}2^{j-1}=n(2^{k}-1),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">w</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msup><mi>H</mi><mi>k</mi></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>k</mi></munderover><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mi>k</mi></msup><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04856.tex", "nexttext": "\nand, together with Staller's previous move which decreases the weight by~$2^s$, their two moves combined decrease the weight by at most~$2^k$.\n\nIf {Edge-hitter } begins the game, his first move decreases the weight of the residual hypergraph by at most\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17847, "prevtext": "\nand is completed when ${\\rm w}(H^k) = 0$; that is, the game is completed when the sum of the weights of the edges in the residual hypergraph $H^k$ equals zero.

If $B \\subseteq A$, then ${\\tau_g}(H|A) \\le {\\tau_g}(H|B)$ and ${\\tau_g^\\prime}(H|A) \\le {\\tau_g^\\prime}(H|B)$.}\n\n\\medskip\n\\begin{proof} Two games will be played, Game A on the hypergraph $H|A$ and Game B on the hypergraph $H|B$. The first of these will be the real game, while Game B\nwill only be imagined by Edge-hitter. In Game A, {Staller } will play optimally while in Game B, {Edge-hitter } will play optimally.\n\nWe claim, by induction on the number of moves played,  that in each stage of the games, the set of edges that are covered in Game~B is a subset of the edges that are covered in Game~A. Since $B \\subseteq A$, this is true at the start of the games. Suppose now that {Staller } has (optimally) selected vertex $u$ in Game~A. This move of {Staller } hits at least one new edge, say $e_u$, in Game~A. By the induction assumption, the edge $e_u$ is not yet hit in Game~B, and so the vertex $u$ is a legal move in Game~B. {Edge-hitter } now copies the move of {Staller } and plays vertex $u$ in Game~B, and then replies with an optimal move in Game~B. If this move is legal in Game A, {Edge-hitter } plays it in Game~ A as well. Otherwise, if the game is not yet over, {Edge-hitter } plays any other legal move in Game A. In both cases the claim assumption is preserved, which by induction also proves the claim.\n\nWe have thus proved that Game~A finishes no later than Game~B. Suppose thus that $k$ moves are played in Game~B. Since {Edge-hitter } was playing optimally in Game~B, $k \\le {\\tau_g}(H|B)$. On the other hand, because {Staller } was playing optimally in Game~A and {Edge-hitter } has a strategy to finish the game in $k$ moves, ${\\tau_g}(H|A) \\le k$. Therefore, ${\\tau_g}(H|A) \\le k \\le {\\tau_g}(H|B)$. Thus, if {Edge-hitter } is the first to play, the desired bound holds.

With this assumption, every component of\n$H$ is one of the following three types:\n\n\\indent\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Type-A:} A $3$-regular, linear hypergraph. \\\\\n\\indent\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Type-B:} A hypergraph with maximum degree~$2$. \\\\\n\\indent\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Type-C:} A hypergraph consisting of a single edge.\n\nWe remark that a Type-A component of $H$ consists entirely of white\nvertices, while a type-B component consists only of green and blue\nvertices, with at least one green vertex. A type-C component\nconsists of three blue vertices. Since a type-B component contains\nonly green and blue vertices, a move played in such a component\ndecreases the weight by at least~$11 + 15 + 2 \\cdot 3 = 32$, since\nat least one vertex and one edge is recolored red, and at least two\nfurther vertices are recolored.  A move played in a Type-C component\ndecreases the weight by $3 \\cdot 11 + 1 \\cdot 15 = 48$, since three\nblue vertices and one edge are recolored red. We state this formally\nas follows.\n\n\\begin{unnumbered}{Claim~\\ref{3unif}.F}\nA move played in a type-B component decreases the weight by at\nleast~$32$,  while a move played in a Type-C component decreases the\nweight by~$48$.\n\\end{unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\\begin{unnumbered}{Claim~\\ref{3unif}.G}\nIf $H$ contains a white vertex, then {Edge-hitter } can achieve a $48$-target.\n\\end{unnumbered}\n\\begin{proof}  Suppose that $H$ contains a white vertex, $v$,\nthat belongs to a component $F$. We note that $F$ is a type-A\ncomponent.   {Edge-hitter } plays the vertex $v$ as his move $m_1$ in the\nresidual hypergraph $H$, which results in  ${\\rm w}_1 \\ge 1 \\cdot 15 + 3\n\\cdot 15 + 6 \\cdot 1 = 66 > 48\\cdot 1$ since after the move is\nplayed, the vertex~$v$ and three edges are recolored red, while all\nsix neighbors of $v$ are recolored green.\n\n\n Then {Staller } responds by playing her move $m_2$. We note\nthat $F - v$ is a linear (possibly disconnected) hypergraph that\ncontains six green vertices with all other vertices colored white.\nIf {Staller } plays her move $m_2$ in $F - v$ or in a Type-A component,\nthen ${\\rm w}_2 \\ge 14 + 2 \\cdot 15 + 4 \\cdot 1 = 48$ since her played\nvertex (colored either white or green) and at least two edges are\nrecolored red, while at least four further vertices are recolored.\nIf {Staller } plays her move $m_2$ in a Type-B component, then, by\nClaim~\\ref{3unif}.F, ${\\rm w}_2 \\ge 32$. If {Staller } plays her move $m_2$ in a\nType-C component, then, by Claim~\\ref{3unif}.F, ${\\rm w}_2 \\ge 48$. In\nall cases, ${\\rm w}_2 \\ge 32$. Therefore, ${\\rm w}_1 + {\\rm w}_2 \\ge 66 + 32 = 98 >\n48 \\cdot 2$, and so Inequality~(\\ref{Eq1}) is satisfied with $k =\n2$.~{\\tiny ($\\Box$)}\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\\medskip\nBy Claim~\\ref{3unif}.G, we may assume that every vertex is colored\ngreen or blue; that is, every component of $H$ is of Type-B or\nType-C. We have seen in Claim~\\ref{3unif}.F that in this situation\n{Staller } can never make a decrease smaller than $32$. Thus, we obtain:\n\n\\begin{unnumbered}{Claim~\\ref{3unif}.H}\nIf {Edge-hitter } can play a vertex that results in a weight decrease of at least~$64$, then he can achieve a $48$-target.\n\\end{unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{unnumbered}{Claim~\\ref{3unif}.I}\nIf $H$ contains two overlapping edges, then {Edge-hitter } can achieve a $48$-target.\n\\end{unnumbered}\n\\begin{proof}\n\n\n Let $e$ and $f$ be two overlapping edges, with $e \\cap f = \\{v_1,v_2\\}$.\n {Edge-hitter } plays the vertex $v_1$ as his move\n$m_1$ in the residual hypergraph $H$, which results in ${\\rm w}_1 \\ge 2\n\\cdot 14 + 2 \\cdot 15 + 2 \\cdot 3 = 64$ since after the move is\nplayed, both vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ (currently colored green) and\ntwo edges are recolored red, while at least two further vertices are\nrecolored (from green to blue, or from blue to red). Thus, by\nClaim~\\ref{3unif}.H, {Edge-hitter } can achieve a $48$-target.~{\\tiny ($\\Box$)}\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\medskip\nBy Claim~\\ref{3unif}.I, we may assume that every Type-B component is linear.

Thus, by Claim~\\ref{3unif}.H, {Edge-hitter } can achieve a\n$48$-target.~{\\tiny ($\\Box$)}\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\medskip\nBy Claim~\\ref{3unif}.J, we may assume that each component of $H$ is\neither a $2$-regular linear hypergraph (consisting entirely of green\nvertices) or an isolated edge (consisting of three blue vertices).\nPlaying a vertex from an isolated edge decreases the weight by $48$,\ntherefore we obtain:\n\n\n\\begin{unnumbered}{Claim~\\ref{3unif}.K}\nIf every component in the residual hypergraph is an isolated edge, then {Edge-hitter } can achieve a $48$-target.\n\\end{unnumbered}\n\n\n\n\\medskip\nBy Claim~\\ref{3unif}.K, we may assume that at least one component,\nsay $F$, of $H$ is a $2$-regular, linear hypergraph. Edge-hitter now\nplays in such a way as to restrict his moves to vertices in $V(F)$,\nindependently of Staller's responses to his moves, as long as a\ngreen vertex in $V(F)$ exists. Further, among all green vertices in\n$V(F)$ at each stage of the game, {Edge-hitter } selects a green vertex with as\nmany blue neighbors as possible.\n\n\nSuppose that a total of $\\ell$ green vertices in $V(F)$ are played\nby Edge-hitter.  The first move, $m_1$, of {Edge-hitter } results in ${\\rm w}_1 = 1\n\\cdot 14 + 2 \\cdot 15 + 4 \\cdot 3 = 56$.

Again, we consider colored hypergraphs,\nwhere each edge and vertex is associated with a color.\n\n The colors of edges and vertices\n  may change as the set $D$ of chosen vertices is\nextended during the game.\n\nAn edge is colored \\emph{white} if it is not covered by a vertex of\n$D$, and is colored \\emph{red} otherwise.  From the partially\ncovered hypergraph  red edges and isolated vertices are deleted.\nThis way we obtain the residual hypergraph.\n\nEach vertex of  the  hypergraph is associated with one from the\nfollowing five colors:  white, yellow, green, blue, and red. This\ncoloring reflects to the degree of the vertex in the residual\nhypergraph; that is, the number of white edges incident to it.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{white} if it has degree at least~$4$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{yellow} if it has degree~$3$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{green} if it has degree~$2$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{blue} if it has degree~$1$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{red} if it is not incident with any\nwhite edges or equivalently, if it is deleted from the residual\nhypergraph.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nWe now define the parameter $\\Delta^*(H)$ of the residual hypergraph\n$H$  of the game as follows. If Edge-hitter is the next player to\nmake a move on $H$, then $\\Delta^*(H)$ is the maximum degree,\n$\\Delta(H)$, of $H$. Otherwise, if Staller is the next player to\nmake a move on $H$, then $\\Delta^*(H)$ denotes the maximum degree of\nthe residual hypergraph before Edge-hitter made his previous move.\nWe associate a weight with every vertex in the residual hypergraph\n$H$ that depends on $\\Delta^*(H)$ and on the color of the vertex in\n$H$.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}  \\hline\n\\emph{Color of vertex} & \\emph{Degree in $H$} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\emph{Weight of vertex}} \\vline \\\\\n\\cline{3-6}\n   & &$\\Delta^*(H) \\ge 5$ & $\\Delta^*(H) =4$ & $\\Delta^*(H) =3$ & $\\Delta^*(H)\n    \\le 2$ \\\\ \\hline\nwhite & $\\ge 4$ &$852$ & $852$ & -- & -- \\\\\nyellow & $3$ & $852$ & $845$ & $845$ & -- \\\\\ngreen & $2$ & $852$  & $838$ & $750$ & $750$ \\\\\nblue & $1$ & $852$  & $831$ & $655$ & $543$ \\\\\nred & --- & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$  \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n\\textbf{Table~2.} The weights of vertices according to their color\nand $\\Delta^*(H)$.\n\\end{center}\n\nFurther, the weight of an edge is $852$ if it is white, and $0$ if it is red.

In order to achieve a $3024$-target, {Edge-hitter } must guarantee that a sequence of moves $m_1, \\ldots, m_k$ are played, starting with his first move $m_1$, and with moves alternating between {Edge-hitter } and {Staller } such that if ${\\rm w}_i$ denotes the decrease in weight after move $m_i$ is played, then\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 46768, "prevtext": "\n\\end{thm}\n\nSince the right side is at most $15 {n_{_H}} + 15{m_{_H}}$,\nTheorem~\\ref{3uniform} is an immediate consequence of\nTheorem~\\ref{3unif} and Theorem~\\ref{3uniformA}.

Again, we consider colored hypergraphs,\nwhere each edge and vertex is associated with a color.\n\n The colors of edges and vertices\n  may change as the set $D$ of chosen vertices is\nextended during the game.\n\nAn edge is colored \\emph{white} if it is not covered by a vertex of\n$D$, and is colored \\emph{red} otherwise.  From the partially\ncovered hypergraph  red edges and isolated vertices are deleted.\nThis way we obtain the residual hypergraph.\n\nEach vertex of  the  hypergraph is associated with one from the\nfollowing five colors:  white, yellow, green, blue, and red. This\ncoloring reflects to the degree of the vertex in the residual\nhypergraph; that is, the number of white edges incident to it.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{white} if it has degree at least~$4$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{yellow} if it has degree~$3$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{green} if it has degree~$2$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{blue} if it has degree~$1$.\n\\item A vertex is colored \\emph{red} if it is not incident with any\nwhite edges or equivalently, if it is deleted from the residual\nhypergraph.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\nWe now define the parameter $\\Delta^*(H)$ of the residual hypergraph\n$H$  of the game as follows. If Edge-hitter is the next player to\nmake a move on $H$, then $\\Delta^*(H)$ is the maximum degree,\n$\\Delta(H)$, of $H$. Otherwise, if Staller is the next player to\nmake a move on $H$, then $\\Delta^*(H)$ denotes the maximum degree of\nthe residual hypergraph before Edge-hitter made his previous move.\nWe associate a weight with every vertex in the residual hypergraph\n$H$ that depends on $\\Delta^*(H)$ and on the color of the vertex in\n$H$.\n\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}  \\hline\n\\emph{Color of vertex} & \\emph{Degree in $H$} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\emph{Weight of vertex}} \\vline \\\\\n\\cline{3-6}\n   & &$\\Delta^*(H) \\ge 5$ & $\\Delta^*(H) =4$ & $\\Delta^*(H) =3$ & $\\Delta^*(H)\n    \\le 2$ \\\\ \\hline\nwhite & $\\ge 4$ &$852$ & $852$ & -- & -- \\\\\nyellow & $3$ & $852$ & $845$ & $845$ & -- \\\\\ngreen & $2$ & $852$  & $838$ & $750$ & $750$ \\\\\nblue & $1$ & $852$  & $831$ & $655$ & $543$ \\\\\nred & --- & $0$ & $0$ & $0$ & $0$  \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\begin{center}\n\\textbf{Table~2.} The weights of vertices according to their color\nand $\\Delta^*(H)$.\n\\end{center}\n\nFurther, the weight of an edge is $852$ if it is white, and $0$ if it is red.

In order to achieve a $3024$-target, {Edge-hitter } must guarantee that a sequence of moves $m_1, \\ldots, m_k$ are played, starting with his first move $m_1$, and with moves alternating between {Edge-hitter } and {Staller } such that if ${\\rm w}_i$ denotes the decrease in weight after move $m_i$ is played, then\n\n", "index": 25, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{i = 1}^k {\\rm w}_i \\ge 3024 \\cdot k\\,, \\label{Eq2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\sum_{i=1}^{k}{\\rm w}_{i}\\geq 3024\\cdot k\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>k</mi></munderover><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">w</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo>\u2265</mo><mrow><mn>3024</mn><mo>\u22c5</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>k</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04856.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\noindent\nThus, Inequality~(\\ref{Eq2}) is satisfied with $k = 2s - 1$ and the game is completed after move $m_k$.

We now consider a vertex, $u'$, from $e_1$ that is different from $u$ and $v$. We note that $u'$ is a green vertex. Let $e'$ be the edge incident with $u'$ that is different from $e$. After Edge-hitter's $s$th move, all remaining vertices are colored blue. In particular, the three vertices in $e' \\setminus \\{u'\\}$ are all colored blue.\n Moreover, by the linearity of $C$, at most one of them belongs to $e_1 \\cup e_2$. Hence, before Edge-hitter's $s$th move, the green vertex $u'$ had at least two blue neighbors\n (in fact at least three together with $u$, but we don't need this now),\n which contradicts the rule that {Edge-hitter } plays a green vertex with the largest number of blue neighbors. Therefore, the vertex $v$ had at least two blue neighbors. Thus, ${\\rm w}_{2s-1} \\ge 750 + 2 \\cdot 852 + 2 \\cdot 543 + 4 \\cdot 207 = 4368$.

We note that subsequent to his\nfirst move, as long as a green vertex in $V(C)$ exists, {Edge-hitter } can play\na green vertex having at least one blue neighbor.\n\n\nSuppose that a total of $s$ green vertices in $V(C)$ are played by Edge-hitter. The first move, $m_1$, of {Edge-hitter } results in ${\\rm w}_1 = 750 + 2 \\cdot 852 + 6 \\cdot 207 = 3696$. Thereafter, each subsequent move $m_{2j+1}$ of Edge-hitter, where $j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,s - 1\\}$, results in ${\\rm w}_{2j+1} \\ge 750 + 2 \\cdot 852 + 543 + 5 \\cdot 207 = 4032$.\n\nEvery move played by Staller decreases the weight by at least~$543 + 852 + 3 \\cdot 207 = 2016$, since with each of her moves at least one edge and a vertex are recolored red,\n and the degree sum of the remaining vertices is decreased by at least~$3$. In particular, each of Staller's moves $m_{2j}$, where $j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,s-1\\}$, results in ${\\rm w}_{2j} \\ge 2016$.
