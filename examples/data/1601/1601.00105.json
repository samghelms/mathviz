Our numerical studies of the ``dynamical order parameter'' in Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glasses and random ferromagnets indicate that the influence of the initial state decays as dimension increases. Similarly, this same order parameter for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick infinite-range spin glass indicates that this information decays as the number of spins increases. Based on these results, we conjecture that the influence of the initial state on the final state decays to zero in finite-dimensional random-bond spin systems as dimension goes to infinity, regardless of the presence of frustration. We also study the rate at which spins ``freeze out'' to a final state as a function of dimensionality and number of spins; here the results indicate that the number of ``active'' spins at long times increases with dimension (for short-range systems) or number of spins (for infinite-range systems). We provide heuristic arguments to support these conjectures, and also analyze theoretically several mean-field models: the random energy model, the uniform Curie-Weiss ferromagnet, and the disordered Curie-Weiss ferromagnet. We find that for these models, the information contained in the initial state does {\\it not\\/} decay in the thermodynamic limit--- in fact, it {\\it fully determines\\/} the final state. Unlike in short-range models, the presence of frustration in mean-field models dramatically alters the dynamical behavior with respect to the issue of predictability.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nThe dynamical properties of Ising spin systems far from equilibrium, and in particular those following a deep quench, continue to be a major focus of research.\nThere are multiple directions along which this research has been pursued, including the general areas of phase-ordering kinetics~\\cite{Bray94,Stauffer94,SKR118,SKR119,KKR}, persistence~\\cite{DBG,J99,MS96,MR00,DHP96},\nand damage spreading~\\cite{Kauffman,Creutz,SSKH,Grassberger}, among many others. \nIn~\\cite{NS99} another line of investigation was proposed: the problem \nof {\\it predictability\\/} and retention of information\nin discrete spin systems evolving far from equilibrium.  \n\nFollowing a deep quench an Ising spin system will be in a random configuration.\nOne can then ask, how rapidly does this information in the initial state decay over time, as a function of dimension, lattice type, model (uniform ferromagnet, random ferromagnet, spin glass, and so on), \nand other characteristics of the system under study? The nature of information \nretention or decay depends on two sources of randomness: that contained in the \ninitial configuration and that generated through the dynamical realization \ngoverning an individual history. This dynamical randomness is present even at zero temperature, in the order that spins are chosen to attempt to flip (and in the tie-breaking rule for homogeneous systems when a spin flip would cost zero energy). Disordered Ising models such \nas random ferromagnets and spin glasses bring in a third source of \nrandomness, namely in the couplings determining the local environment of an \nindividual spin. We are interested in the question of how much information \ncontained in the configuration at time $t$ depends on the initial configuration and \nhow much depends on the specific dynamical path the system has followed. \nWe will formalize these remarks in Sect.~\\ref{sec:preliminaries} below.  We have colloquially referred to the above as the ``nature vs.~nurture'' problem, where nature represents the information contained in the initial configuration and (quenched) random couplings, while nurture refers to the history (i.e., dynamical realization) of the subsequent evolution of the system. \n\nIt was shown in early work that this problem can be solved exactly for $1D$ random\nferromagnets and spin glasses~\\cite{NNS00}. Preliminary numerical studies on the $2D$~{\\it homogeneous\\/}\nferromagnet on the square lattice were reported in~\\cite{ONSS06}. \nMore recently, extensive numerical studies~\\cite{YMNS13} have \nlargely solved the nature vs.~nurture problem for the uniform~$2D$ ferromagnet, so that\nthe rate of decay of initial information for this model is now understood quantitatively. These results will be briefly reviewed in the next section.\n\nIn this paper we turn our attention to {\\it disordered\\/} Ising models in dimensions greater than one.\nOur particular focus will be on the behavior of the random ferromagnet \nand the Edwards-Anderson~(EA) spin glass~\\cite{EA75}\nas a function of dimension. We will also consider the infinite-range Sherrington-Kirkpatrick~(SK) spin glass~\\cite{SK75}\nas a function of system size $N$. Our conclusions will be based on numerical studies, but in Sect.~\\ref{sec:discussion} we\nalso present an analytical discussion of these models, as well as the random energy model (REM)~\\cite{Derrida80} and the uniform and disordered Curie-Weiss ferromagnets.\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\n\\label{sec:preliminaries}\n\nConsider a set of Ising spins $S_i=\\pm 1$ on the sites $i$ of the Euclidean lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with periodic boundary conditions.

Here and throughout this work, time  $t$ is measured in sweeps, where one sweep corresponds to $N$ spin-flip attempts.\nThe overlap is initially unity: $q_0(N)=1$ and, on average, decays in time. For each finite realization, it reaches a final value when both twins are in absorbing states; we are therefore interested, in addition to $q_\\infty$ defined above, \nin the $N$ (equivalently, $L$) dependence of $q_t(N)$ for the three models.  We also study the time to reach the absorbing state and the fraction of active or flippable spins as a function of time.  \n\nWe use the algorithm introduced in~\\cite{YMNS13}.  For the first $t_0$ sweeps we implement Glauber dynamics directly: A spin $S_i$ is randomly selected,  the energy change $\\Delta E_i$ is computed, and the spin is flipped ($S_i \\rightarrow -S_i$) if $\\Delta E_i < 0$ and not flipped otherwise.  After each attempted spin flip, time is incremented by $1/N$ sweeps.  After $t_0$ sweeps, only a few active spins (such that $\\Delta E_i < 0$) remain and the dynamics is  significantly accelerated using kinetic Monte Carlo methods. To implement kinetic Monte Carlo, a list of active spins is maintained.   A single step of kinetic Monte Carlo consists of selecting a spin at random from the active list and then carrying out the flip.   The time is incremented by 1/${f_t(N)}$,  where ${f_t(N)}$ is the number of active spins before the spin flip.  After the spin flip the active list is updated: the spin at $i$ is removed from the list and its neighbors are all checked to see if they must be added to or removed from the active list. Kinetic Monte Carlo dramatically improves the run time for the $d$-dimensional models.

How can we reconcile these disparities? In fact, these observations are not in contradiction. The most likely scenario is that ${\\tau}(N)$ approaches a finite dimension-dependent constant for all finite $d$, and our simulations simply have not gone to sufficiently large $N$. But other possibilities are also consistent with observations. The fact that each spin flips finitely often of course does {\\it not\\/} necessarily imply that the survival time, or (roughly) equivalently, the mean number of spin flips per site, is finite: it could be the case that a small number of spins continue to flip long after most of the others have reached their final state. This would also be consistent with the overlap saturating while the survival time is still increasing with $N$. A more detailed numerical study is needed to determine whether this is indeed happening.\n\nHowever, our main interest here is the dependence on $d$ of the mean number of spin flips per site at fixed $N$.  This is not the same quantity as ${\\tau}(N)$, for the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph; nevertheless, the two are related, and the clear increase in~${\\tau}(N)$ with dimension $d$ that can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:CT} provides reasonable supporting (more accurately, necessary but not sufficient) evidence that the typical number of spin flips per site increases with $d$, and we will take this as one of our conjectures in Sect.~\\ref{sec:discussion}.\t\n\n\\subsection{Random Ferromagnet in 2D}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:RF} is a plot ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N)}}$ vs. $N$ for the $d=2$ random ferromagnet.  Similarly to the EA spin glass, ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N)}}$ quickly saturates to a constant and it is reasonable to assume that at the largest system size, ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N_{\\rm max})}} \\approx \\overline{q_\\infty(N\\rightarrow\\infty)}$.  We note that ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N_{\\rm max})}} = 0.4198(1)$ for $N_{\\rm max} =  100^2$, and it is interesting to compare this result to that obtained for the $d=2$  \nEA spin glass, where ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N_{\\rm max})}} = 0.4166(1)$ for the same largest size $N_{\\rm max} = 100^2$.   The two results are very close, within 1\\% of each other, though they differ by many standard errors.  Since the error bar accounts only for statistical errors, and not finite-size systematic errors, it is possible that $\\overline{q_\\infty(N\\rightarrow\\infty)}$  is identical for spin glasses and random ferromagnets, though we believe it is more likely that they differ.  In either case, the closeness of the two values of $\\overline{q_\\infty(N\\rightarrow\\infty)}$ suggest that frustration, which is present in the spin glass but not the random ferromagnet, plays little or no role in the nature vs.~nurture problem for finite dimensions.\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centering  \n\\includegraphics[scale=1]{RF.eps}\n\\caption{ $q_\\infty(N)$ vs.\\ $N$ for the $d=2$ random ferromagnet. } \n\\label{fig:RF} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model}\nThis section presents  results for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, the Ising spin glass on the complete graph.\nFigure \\ref{fig:FIT} is a plot of ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N)}}$  \nas a function of $N$.  While it is clear that ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N)}}$ is decreasing with $N$ it is not obvious whether $\\overline{q_\\infty(N\\rightarrow\\infty)}$ is zero or greater than zero.  \n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centering \n\\includegraphics[scale=1.2]{QFN.eps}\n\\caption{The points are simulation results for ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N)}}$ vs.\\ $N$ for the SK model.

Nonetheless, the second functional form also provides a reasonable fit and implies that $\\overline{q_\\infty(N\\rightarrow\\infty)} >0$.  It is also noteworthy that the leading coefficient, $a$ of the first functional form is stable with respect to changing the fitting range while this is not true of the second functional form.  Although the numerics are not definitive, we believe that it is most likely that ${\\overline{q_\\infty(N)}}$ converges very slowly, i.e.\\ as $1/\\log(N)^{1/3}$, to $\\overline{q_\\infty(N\\rightarrow\\infty)}=0$.  Since, in some sense, the SK model is believed to correspond to the EA model at $d=\\infty$, these results provide further support to the conjecture that $q_\\infty\\rightarrow 0$ in the EA~model as dimensionality goes to infinity.\n\nNext we consider the survival time as a function of $N$.\nFor the SK model, we define ${\\tau}(N)$ as the median survival time for a system of $N$~spins.  We note that distribution of survival times is well described by a lognormal and obtain the median by fitting the data to a lognormal.   Figure \\ref{fig:CTN} is a log-log plot of ${\\tau}(N)$  vs.\\ $N$.\nA power law fit with a $1/N$ correction to scaling, ${\\tau}(N) = a N^b (1 + c/N)$ does a reasonable job of fitting the data for $N \\geq 800$.  The fitted exponent is  $b=0.69$.   A pure power law is a worse fit and yields a smaller value of the exponent, $b=0.64$. The pure power law with $b=0.64$ is shown as the solid curve in Fig. \\ref{fig:CTN}.  Although we have low confidence in the value of the exponent describing ${\\tau}$, in contrast to the finite-dimensional models, it seems clear that the survival time diverges in $N$, most likely as a power near $2/3$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centering  \n\\includegraphics[scale=1]{CTN.eps}\n\\caption{The median time for reaching the absorbing state, ${\\tau}(N)$ vs.\\ number of spins, $N$ for the SK model.} \n\\label{fig:CTN} \n\\end{figure}\n\nFinally, we study the fraction of active (flippable) spins ${f_t(N)}$ as a function of time $t$. \nFigure \\ref{fig:FLS} is a log-log plot of ${f_t(N)}$ vs.\\ $t$. We find that for the first 10 sweeps, ${f_t(N)}$ has a power law decay.   At longer times the curves fall much more steeply.  However, for intermediate times and the larger system sizes there appears to be a flattening before the steep fall-off.   Thus the asymptotic behavior in time for  ${f_t(N)}$ in the limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ is not clear.  A power law  ${f_t(N)} = (1/2)(t +1)^{-1.52}$ in the range $0 \\leq t \\leq 10$ is a good fit to the data for all values of $N$.  \n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centering  \n\\includegraphics[scale=1]{FLS.eps}\n\\caption{Log-log plot of the fraction of active spins ${f_t(N)}$ vs.\\ $t$ for the SK model for different sizes $N$ with sizes increasing from left to right. } \n\\label{fig:FLS} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\nIn this section we summarize the numerical results presented above, and discuss them within the context of the theory of the nature vs.~nurture problem. We also examine\nsome other mean-field models for which rigorous conclusions can be stated, and whose dynamical behavior is surprising given our knowledge of the behavior of \nfinite-dimensional systems and the SK model.\n\nThe numerical results discussed above focused on three disordered systems: the EA~spin glass and random ferromagnet as a function of dimension~$d$, and the SK~spin glass as a function of the number of spins~$N$.\nWhile no firm conclusions can yet be drawn for these models, the results suggest several broad conclusions, which for now remain as conjectures:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item In the numerical simulations of the EA model and random ferromagnet on~$\\mathbb{Z}^d$ reported in Sect.~\\ref{sec:results},\nthe survival time is seen to increase with dimension~$d$; based on this (see the discussion at the end of Sect.~\\ref{subsec:EA}), we conjecture that the number of spin flips per site diverges as $d\\to\\infty$.\n\n\\item The dynamical order parameter $q_\\infty$ in the EA~model and random ferromagnet on $\\mathbb Z^d$ is nonzero for any fixed $d<\\infty$ but tends to zero as $d\\to\\infty$, and similarly in the SK~model as $N\\to\\infty$.  \n\n\\item In short-range models, the dynamical behavior studied here is relatively insensitive to frustration, in that the spin glass and random ferromagnet behave similarly. However,  frustration appears to play an important role in mean-field models, as discussed below.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nWhile we do not as yet have analytical results on these conjectures, we can provide heuristic arguments in their support. We first do so for short range models, then present some analytical results for mean field models and a corresponding heuristic for the SK model.\n\n\\subsection{Short-range models}\n\nWe begin with some relevant rigorous results obtained in an earlier paper~\\cite{NS99}.   These are the following: first, for both the EA~spin glass and the random ferromagnet on the infinite Euclidean lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ for any finite~$d$, there \nis an {\\it uncountable\\/} infinity of $k$-spin-flip stable states, for any finite $k\\ge 1$ (states with $k=1$ comprise the set of final possible \nstates for the dynamics described in this paper). The overlap distribution for the set of such states is a $\\delta$-function at 0. \n\nRelated to the above result is that if one begins with two independently chosen random initial configurations for either the spin glass or random ferromagnet in any finite dimension, and lets their respective (zero-temperature Glauber) dynamics proceed independently, then the two dynamical runs will almost surely ``land'' in separate 1-spin-flip stable states with overlap zero. However, the nature vs.~nurture question focuses on a {\\it single\\/} randomly chosen initial configuration and asks for the spin overlap between the final states obtained through different runs under independent dynamical realizations. In~\\cite{NS99}, it was proved that with probability~one the spin overlap between final states obtained under two independent dynamical runs starting from the {\\it same\\/} initial configuration is none other than $q_\\infty>0$.\n\nThe question then becomes how, given this perspective on the problem, we would expect this overlap to change with dimension. To address this, we note another relevant result from~\\cite{NS99}. This\nasserts that the union of the basins of attraction of all $k$-spin flip stable states in any of these models has measure zero in the space of all randomly chosen initial conditions. Moreover, \nany initial condition (except for a set of measure zero) is on the boundary of an uncountably infinite number of basins of attraction of 1-spin-flip stable states. It follows that two dynamical realizations starting from the same initial condition have probability zero of landing in the same 1-spin-flip state for any fixed $d$.\n\nSo far all of our arguments are rigorously supported, but at this point we need to turn to heuristic arguments. It seems reasonable, and is (weakly) supported by the numerical results in \nSect.~\\ref{sec:results} that\nthe number of spin flips per site in a typical dynamical run diverges as $d\\to\\infty$. As a consequence, it is reasonable to expect that the system can access an increasingly large subset of the set of all 1-spin-flip stable states. One would then expect the overlap of the 1-spin flip stable states within reach of a typical initial configuration to decay to zero as the dimension increases. This would then lead to $q_\\infty\\to 0$ as $d\\to \\infty$. \nSuch an argument, of course, is only suggestive, and a fully rigorous approach will be pursued elsewhere. \n\n\\subsection{Mean-field models}\n\nIt is also of interest to consider \nsome mean-field models which have not previously been studied from the nature vs.~nurture perspective. The previous discussion may lead one to\nsuppose that for a mean field model, $q_\\infty\\to 0$ as $N\\to\\infty$ should be normally expected. However, as we will see below, this is not the case. \n\nWe consider the random energy model~(REM)~\\cite{Derrida80}, the Curie-Weiss ferromagnet, and (briefly) the random ferromagnet. While the results described below can be proved, we will present them here informally.  We begin with the REM. Although the REM is not typically thought of as a dynamical model, there is a natural dynamics associated with it. \nFor any $N$-spin system there are $2^N$ corresponding spin configurations, which are the corners of the hypercube. The REM assigns a random energy independently to each corner (or site) of the hypercube.\nThe distribution of the energies could be Gaussian, as in the original formulation of the REM, or flat, or some similar distribution; the results are independent of the specific form, as long as the variance of the\ndistribution is finite. A local minimum then corresponds to a site whose $N$ neighboring sites \non the hypercube all have larger energy. (This corresponds to a 1-spin flip stable state, because the spin configuration corresponding to each neighbor on the hypercube differs from that corresponding to the original site by a single spin flip.)\n\nConsider now a random walk starting at an arbitrary site, corresponding to a uniformly chosen point on the hypercube. If the starting site is a local minimum the walk goes no farther.\nOtherwise, if the site has $k$ (out of $N$) neighbors with lower energy, the walk chooses one uniformly at random among the $k$.\nThis is equivalent to the usual zero-temperature Glauber or Metropolis dynamics on the Ising spin system formulation of the REM. One then continues the process until it ends at a local minimum.\n\nWe can then ask a number of well-posed questions; in particular, how long is the length of a typical walk? If such a walk does not proceed, on average, macroscopically far in the hypercube (i.e., has $o(N)$ steps), then  $q_\\infty$ should go to 1. \nBut this is precisely the case for the REM. In fact, this problem was solved in a different context by Kauffman and Levin~\\cite{KL87}, who found that, on average, such a walk takes only $O(\\log N)$ steps. Consequently, $q_\\infty\\ge 1 - O(\\log N/N)$.  Therefore, as $N\\to\\infty$, $q_\\infty\\to 1$: nature always wins! This is an unusual result, which we have not seen for any nontrivial short-range model. (The largest $q_\\infty$ found for other models is 1/2, for a random Ising chain in one dimension~\\cite{NNS00}.) The REM is of great interest because, despite its simplicity, it mimics  much (though certainly not all) of the thermodynamics of the far more complex SK model. These arguments demonstrate, though, that the dynamics of the two models, at least from the viewpoint espoused in this paper, are very different.\n\nWe turn now to the mean-field ferromagnetic models. In the case of the homogeneous Curie-Weiss model with $N$ spins, a typical initial condition will have an excess of spins \n(of order $\\sqrt{N}$) in one state (say the plus state) over the other. Given the usual Glauber dynamics, it's clear that the final state will then be all plus, so the \ntypical initial condition completely determines the final configuration. The only initial condition in which this will not be true is when exactly half the spins (assuming $N$ is even) in the initial condition are plus and half minus. It is easy to see that the contribution to $q_\\infty$ from such configurations goes to zero as $N\\to \\infty$. \n\nFor disordered Curie-Weiss models, in which the couplings are i.i.d.~nonnegative random variables, it can be shown that $q_\\infty$ still goes to $1$ as $N\\to \\infty$, but more extensive arguments are required. A brief sketch of such an argument is as follows. A typical initial spin configuration will have on order $\\sqrt N$ excess of plus or minus spins. Without loss of generality suppose the initial spin configuration has a positive magnetization of order $\\sqrt{N}$. It is not hard to show, after taking into account the effect of fluctuations in the magnitudes of the couplings, that the difference between the number of sites with positive and negative effective field at time $0$ is thus of order $\\sqrt{N}$ with probability going to one as $N\\to\\infty$.\nNow letting the time increase from 0 to a time $t=o(\\sqrt N)$ later, one can use standard arguments based on the law of large numbers and central limit theorem to show that the magnetization increases by order $t$ during this time interval. This continues for all times of order $N^{\\frac 12-\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon>0$ during which, with probability approaching $1$, no site's effective field changes sign. \nBut once $O(\\sqrt N)$ flips have taken place, the magnetization has shifted on order $O(\\sqrt N)$ causing a corresponding shift, of the same order as the fluctuations in the effective field, in the effective field at every site. Thus every site's effective field after a time of order $\\sqrt{N}$ is shifted in the positive direction by a quantity converging to a point mass at $c>0$; consequently, some sites that had previously had negative effective fields now have positive ones.\n\nRepeating this until a time $t=O(N^{\\frac 12+\\epsilon})$ (for any $\\epsilon>0$) leads, with high probability, to every site having positive effective field. Since the dynamics of the disordered Curie-Weiss model are monotone, then from that time on, spins flip only from minus to plus and the system steadily drifts to the all plus state. The conclusion is that as $N\\to \\infty$, with probability approaching $1$, the system (thought of as a random walker on the $2^N$ hypercube) avoids all local minima and rapidly descends down the energy landscape to the all plus 1-spin flip stable state.  \n\nWe conclude with a heuristic argument suggesting that the behavior of the SK model is very different: for this case we conjecture that $q_\\infty(N)\\to 0$ as $N\\to\\infty$. The SK model has exponentially many local minima as $N\\to \\infty$, and they are believed to be uniformly distributed on the hypercube (i.e., have \ntypical overlap $0$). Unlike the random ferromagnet, however, there is no natural ``downward drift'' toward a global energy minimum in the SK model owing to the randomness in the signs of the couplings. Moreover, unlike in the REM model, the energies assigned to vertices of the hypercube are highly correlated: the difference in energy of neighbors on the hypercube should be distributed as~$\\sim N(0,1)$ (where $N(0,V)$ is the normal, or Gaussian, distribution of mean zero and variance $V$), while the energy of a typical site is distributed as~$\\sim N(0,N)$. \n\nThe numerics (Fig.~\\ref{fig:CTN} ) also suggest that the SK spin glass dynamics take more than $O(N)$ steps on the hypercube before reaching a local minimum, implying that a typical dynamical realization can traverse most of the hypercube as $N\\to \\infty$. Thus it should be the case that as $N\\to\\infty$, the set of accessible local minima approaches the set of all local minima, suggesting that $q_\\infty(N)\\to 0$ as $N\\to \\infty$.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements} \n\nJM was supported in part by NSF DMR-1208046 and DMR-1507506.
