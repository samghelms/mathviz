We present HARPS observations of sunlight scattered off the bright asteroid 4/Vesta, from which we deduced the Sun's activity-driven RV variations. In parallel, the HMI instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous high spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and continuum images of the Sun in the Fe {\\sc I} 6173\\AA~line. \nWe determine the RV modulation arising from the suppression of granular blueshift in magnetised regions and the flux imbalance induced by dark spots and bright faculae. The rms velocity amplitudes of these contributions are 2.40~m~s$^{-1}$ and 0.41~m~s$^{-1}$, respectively, which\nconfirms that the inhibition of convection is the dominant source of activity-induced RV variations at play, in accordance with previous studies.\nWe find the Doppler imbalances of spot and plage regions to be only weakly anticorrelated. Lightcurves can thus only give incomplete predictions of convective blueshift suppression. We must instead seek proxies that track the plage coverage on the visible stellar hemisphere directly. The chromospheric flux index $R'_{HK}$ derived from the HARPS spectra performs poorly in this respect, possibly because of the differences in limb brightening/darkening in the chromosphere and photosphere. \nWe also find that the activity-driven RV variations of the Sun are strongly correlated with its full-disc magnetic flux density, which may become a useful proxy for activity-related RV noise.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\\begin{keywords}\ntechniques: radial velocities -- Sun: activity -- Sun: faculae, sunspots, granulation\n\n\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{intro}\n\nThe surface of a star is constantly bustling with magnetic activity. Starspots and faculae/plage\\footnote{Plages are formed in the upper photosphere, chromosphere and upper layers of the stellar atmosphere \\citep{Lean1997,Murdin:2002td}. They are not part of the lower photosphere, where the continuum absorption lines originate, from which the RV of a star is measured; however, plage regions do map closely to faculae and sunspots \\citep{Hall:2008uga,Schrijver:2002ht}.} \ninhibit convective motions taking place at the stellar surface, thus suppressing part of the blueshift naturally resulting from granulation. In addition, dark starspots \n(and bright faculae, to a lesser extent)\ncoming in and out of view as the star rotates induce an imbalance between the redshifted and blueshifted halves of the star, which translates into an RV variation. Stellar activity, through the perturbation of photospheric convection, induces RV variations on much longer timescales of the order of years, in tune with their magnetic cycles (\\emph{eg.} see \\citet{2010A&A...511A..54S, 2011A&A...535A..55D, 2015arXiv151006446D}).\n\nShort-term activity-induced RV variations are quasi-periodic: they are modulated by the star's rotation and change as active regions (starspots and faculae) emerge, evolve and disappear.\nThe amplitude of these variations is 1-2 m~s$^{-1}$ in ``quiet\" stars \\citep{2010ApJ...725..875I}, but they are often larger than this and can mimic or conceal the Doppler signatures of orbiting planets.\nThis has resulted in several false detections (see \\citet{Queloz:2001be,Bonfils:2007cz,Huelamo:2008bk,Boisse:2009gl,Boisse:2011bw,Gregory:2011vg,Haywood:2014hsa,Santos:2014ho,Robertson:2014iz} and many others). \n\n\n\nUnderstanding the RV signatures of stellar activity, especially those at the stellar rotation timescale, is essential to develop the next generation of more sophisticated activity models and further improve our ability to detect and characterise (super-)Earths and even small Neptunes in orbits of a few days to weeks. \nIn particular, identifying informative and reliable proxies for the activity-driven RV variations is crucial.\n\\cite{Desort:2007dt} found that the traditional spectroscopic indicators (the bisector span (BIS) and full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the cross-correlation profile) and photometric variations do not give enough information for slowly rotating, Sun-like stars (low $v\\sin i$) to disentangle stellar activity signatures from the orbits of super-Earth-mass planets. \n\nThe Sun is a unique test case as it is the only star whose surface can be resolved at high resolution, therefore allowing us to investigate directly the impact of magnetic features on RV observations. Early attempts to measure the RV of the integrated solar disc did not provide quantitative results about the individual activity features responsible for RV variability.\n\\cite{1986AdSpR...6...89J} measured integrated sunlight using a resonant scattering spectrometer and found that the presence of magnetically active regions on the solar disc led to variations of up to 15~m~s$^{-1}$. They also measured the disc-integrated magnetic flux but did not find any significant correlation with RV at the time due to insufficient precision.\nAt about the same time, \\cite{Deming:1987jj} obtained spectra of integrated sunlight with an uncertainty level below 5~m~s$^{-1}$, enabling them to see the RV signature of supergranulation. The trend they observed over the 2-year period of their observations was consistent with suppression of convective blueshift from active regions on the solar surface.\nA few years later, \\cite{Deming:1994he} confirmed the findings of both \\cite{1986AdSpR...6...89J} and \\cite{Deming:1987jj}, only with a greater statistical significance. \nNot all studies were in agreement with each other, however; \\cite{1993ApJ...403..801M} recorded spectra of sunlight scattered off the Moon over a 5-year period and found that any variations due to solar activity were smaller than 4~m~s$^{-1}$. \n\nMore recently, \\cite{Molaro:2010kq} obtained HARPS spectra of the large and bright asteroid Ceres to construct a wavelength atlas for the Sun. They found that these spectra of scattered sunlight provided precise disc-integrated solar RVs, and proposed using asteroid spectra to calibrate high precision spectrographs used for planet hunting, such as HIRES and HARPS (see a recent paper by \\citet{Lanza2015}).  \n\n\nIn parallel, significant discoveries were made towards a precise quantitative understanding of the RV impact of solar surface features.\n \\cite{Lagrange:2010ija} and \\cite{Meunier:2010hc} used a catalogue of sunspot numbers and sizes and MDI/SOHO magnetograms to simulate integrated-Sun spectra over a full solar cycle and deduce the impact of sunspots and faculae/plage on RV variations. \nThe work of \\cite{Meunier:2010hc} also relied on the amplitude of convection inhibition derived by  \\citet{1990A&A...231..221B}, based on spatially-resolved magnetogram observations of plage and quiet regions on the Sun (\\emph{i.e.}, independently of full-disc RV measurements).\n\n\nSunspot umbrae and penumbrae are cooler and therefore darker than the surrounding quiet photosphere, producing a flux deficit at the local rotational velocity. Faculae, which tend to be spatially associated with spot groups, are slightly brighter than the quiet photosphere, producing a spectral flux excess at the local rotational velocity. Spots have large contrasts and small area coverage, while faculae have lower contrasts but cover large areas.\nWe thus expect their rotational Doppler signals to be of opposite signs (due to the opposite sign of their flux) and of roughly similar amplitudes. However, facular emission also occurs independently of spot activity  in the more extended  solar magnetic network \\citep{2001ApJ...555..462C}, so their contributions do not cancel out completely. \\citet{Meunier:2010hc} found that the residual signal resulting from the rotational Doppler imbalance of both sunspots and faculae is comparable to that of the sunspots on their own.\n \\citet{Lagrange:2010ija} estimated the rotational perturbation due to sunspot flux deficit to be of the order of 1~m~s$^{-1}$. \nIn a complementary study, \\citet{Meunier:2010hc} also investigated on the effect of sunspots and faculae on the suppression of convective blueshift by magnetic regions. Sunspots occupy a much smaller area than faculae, and as they are dark, they contribute little flux, so their impact on the convective blueshift is negligible. Facular suppression of granular blueshift, however, can lead to variations in RV of up to 8-10 m~s$^{-1}$ \\citep{Meunier:2010hc}.\n\\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M} estimated the disc-integrated solar RV variations expected from the suppression of convective blueshift, directly from MDI/SOHO Dopplergrams and magnetograms (in the 6768 \\AA~Ni {\\sc I} line). Their reconstructed RV variations, over one magnetic cycle agree with the simulations of \\citet{Meunier:2010hc}, establishing the suppression of convective blueshift by magnetic features as the dominant source of activity-induced RV variations. \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M} also found that the regions where the convective blueshift is most strongly attenuated correspond to the most magnetically active regions, as was expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, \\cite{Pesnell:2012ik}) in 2010, continuous observations of the solar surface brightness, velocity and magnetic fields have become available with image resolution finer than the photospheric granulation pattern. This allows us to probe the RV variations of the Sun in unprecedented detail. \nIn the present paper, we deduce the activity-driven RV variations of the Sun based on HARPS observations of the bright asteroid Vesta (Section~\\ref{harps}). In parallel, we use high spatial resolution continuum, Dopplergram and magnetogram images of the Fe {\\sc I} 6173\\AA~line from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI/SDO, \\cite{Schou:2012cz}) to model the RV contributions from sunspots (and pores), faculae and granulation via inhibition of granular blueshift and flux blocking (Section~\\ref{sdo}). This allows us to create a model which we test against the HARPS observations (Section~\\ref{reproduce}). Finally, we discuss the implications of our study for the effectiveness of various proxy indicators for activity-driven RV variations in stars. We show that the disc-averaged magnetic flux could become an excellent proxy for activity-driven RV variations on other stars (Section~\\ref{proxy}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{geometry.png}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Schematic representation of the Sun, Vesta and Earth configuration during the period of observations (not to scale).}\n\\label{geometry}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{HARPS observations of sunlight scattered off Vesta}\\label{harps}\n\\subsection{HARPS spectra}\nThe HARPS spectrograph, mounted on the ESO 3.6\\,m telescope at La Silla was used to observe sunlight scattered from the bright asteroid 4/Vesta (its average magnitude during the run was 7.6). Two to three measurements per night were made with simultaneous Thorium exposures for a total of 98 observations, spread over 37 nights between 2011 September 29 and December 7. The geometric configuration of the Sun and Vesta relative to the observer is illustrated in Figure~\\ref{geometry}.\n\nAt the time of the observations, the Sun was just over three years into its 11-year magnetic cycle; the SDO data confirm that the Sun showed high levels of activity. \n\nThe spectra were reprocessed using the HARPS DRS pipeline \\citep{Baranne:1996tb,Lovis:2007cp}. Instead of applying a conventional barycentric correction, the wavelength scale of the calibrated spectra was adjusted to correct for the \n Doppler shifts due to the relative motion of the Sun and Vesta, and the relative motion of Vesta and the observer (see Section~\\ref{relativistic}). \n \nThe FWHM and BIS (as defined in \\citet{Queloz:2001be}) and $\\log R'_{\\rm HK}$ index were also derived by the pipeline.\nThe median, minimum and maximum signal to noise ratio of the reprocessed HARPS spectra at central wavelength 556.50 nm are 161.3, 56.3 and 257.0, respectively.\nOverall, HARPS achieved a precision of 75 $\\pm$ 25 cm~s$^{-1}$ (see Table~A1). The reprocessed HARPS cross-correlation functions and derived RV measurements are available in the Supplementary Files that are available online.\n\n\n\nWe account for the RV modulation induced by Vesta's rotation in Section~\\ref{axial}, and investigate sources of intra-night RV variations in Section~\\ref{instrument}. We selected the SDO images in such a way as to compensate for the different viewing points of Vesta and the SDO spacecraft: Vesta was trailing SDO, as shown in Figure~\\ref{geometry}. This is taken into account in Section~\\ref{timelag}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{book2}\n\\centering\n\\caption{\\emph{Panel (a):} HARPS RV variations in the solar rest-frame, corrected for relativistic Doppler effects (but not yet corrected for Vesta's axial rotation). \\emph{Panel (b):} HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star (after removing the RV contribution of Vesta's axial rotation). \\emph{Panel (c):} Nightly binned HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star -- note the change in scale on the $y$-axis.

The spacecraft is at position (0, 0, $r_{\\rm sc}$).\nThe $w, n, r$ components of the spacecraft's position relative to each element $ij$ can thus be written as:\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\delta w_{ij} = w_{ij} - 0 \\\\\n\\delta n_{ij} = n_{ij} - 0 \\\\\n\\delta r_{ij} = r_{ij} - r_{\\rm sc}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9X.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\delta w_{ij}=w_{ij}-0\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>w</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>w</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9Xa.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\delta n_{ij}=n_{ij}-0\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9Xb.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\delta r_{ij}=r_{ij}-r_{\\rm sc}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>sc</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05651.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 29333, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spacecraft's motion and the rotation of the Sun introduce velocity perturbations, which we determine in Sections~\\ref{spacecraft} and~\\ref{sunrot}, respectively.

The final model is shown in Figure~\\ref{all}. \n\n\n\nWe list the best-fit values of the scaling parameters for each of the basis functions in Table~\\ref{table}. We note that the values of $A$ and $B$, which represent the difference in response of HARPS and SDO to the Doppler imbalance and the suppression of convective blueshift, differ from unity.\nThe HMI/SDO images are based on measurements of a single spectral line, namely the Fe {\\sc I} 6173\\AA~line, which may not be representative of the several thousand lines from which the HARPS RVs are derived. \nThe value of $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ is determined by the contrast between the magnetic elements (spots, faculae) and the quiet-Sun photosphere. Most of the lines in the HARPS mask lie blueward of Fe {\\sc I} 6173\\AA\\ where the contrast is greater for both types of feature. We therefore expect to have to scale the SDO-derived $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ by a factor of order, but greater than, unity. We measure it to be $2.45 \\pm 2.02$; the amplitude of $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ is so small that $A$ cannot be distinguished from unity when the additional variance $s$ is taken into account.\nThe strength of the convection inhibition changes with line depth (\\emph{cf.} \\citet{2009ApJ...697.1032G} and \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M}). We find that the HARPS response to suppression of granular blueshift is $1.85 \\pm 0.27$ times greater than we predict from SDO.\n\n \n We show a plot of the observed HARPS RVs ($\\Delta RV_{\\mathrm{Sun}}$) \\emph{vs.} our SDO-modelled RVs ($\\Delta RV_{\\mathrm{model}}$) in Figure~\\ref{comparison}, in a similar fashion to Figure 9 of \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M}. We see good agreement between the data and the model. The Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.64 for the full dataset and 0.87 when considering only the second part of the run. This is close to, although not as good as the correlation coefficient of 0.94 found by \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M} between simulated velocities of \\cite{Meunier:2010hc} and MDI/SOHO Dopplergrams.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 0.35\\textwidth]{comparison}\n\\centering\n\\caption{HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star \\emph{vs.} our model derived from SDO/HMI images.

The predicted Doppler imbalance was much smaller than the observed activity-driven RV variations. The associated suppression of convective blueshift was of larger amplitude than, and partially correlated with, the observed RVs. The residuals, however, had a similar amplitude and shared the covariance properties of the star's (simultaneous) lightcurve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present study provides a natural explanation of this mismatch: on the Sun, the faculae are not perfectly co-spatial with sunspot groups.

In other words, the resolution of HARPS is not adequate to fully resolve the BIS variations in a star rotating as slowly as the Sun, which could reduce the correlation coefficients computed with the BIS. \n\n \\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 0.485\\textwidth]{book3}\n\\centering\n\\caption{\\emph{Panel (a):} HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star; \\emph{panels (b) and (c):} time series of the disc-averaged line-of-sight magnetic flux $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$ and filling factor $f$, respectively, determined from the SDO/HMI magnetograms; \\emph{panels (d), (e) and (f):} time series of the FWHM, BIS and $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$, respectively, determined from the HARPS DRS reduction pipeline.

Foreshortening and limb darkening affect the Ca {\\sc II} HK emission cores and the brightness-weighted line-of-sight granular velocities in different ways. Near the limb, the Ca {\\sc II} emission in plages originates in higher, hotter regions of the chromosphere and remains bright. The limb darkening of facular pixels is less than that of quiet-sun pixels, but near the limb the line-of-sight component of the radial motion of bright granule cores is reduced by foreshortening. The disc-averaged line-of-sight magnetic field strength is attenuated by both foreshortening and limb darkening in approximately the same way as the radial motion of the granular flow. This may explain why, even though the RVs and $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ values were measured simultaneously from the same spectra, the correlation between the variations in $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ and suppression of granular blueshift appears weak. \nIn their study of long-term solar RV variations spanning over 8 years, \\citet{Lanza2015} \nfind a stronger correlation between $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ and RV variations, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.357. This positive correlation is in agreement with previous studies of quiet late-type stars \\citep{2012A&A...541A...9G,Lovis:2011vq}, and shows that the $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ may be a more useful proxy for long-term RV variations induced the stellar magnetic cycle.\n\nWe note that in Figure~\\ref{correlation}, the variations in $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ look similar to the variations in RV, except that they are shifted by a few days (this is especially noticeable towards the end of the run). The reality and origin of this shift will be the subject of future studies, thanks to the wealth of Sun as-a-star RV observations that are currently being gathered by the solar telescope at HARPS-N.\n\n\n\\subsection{Disc-averaged observed magnetic flux $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$}\nWe compute the full-disc line-of-sight magnetic flux of the Sun, by summing the intensity-weighted line-of-sight unsigned magnetic flux in each pixel:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 50818, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{book1.pdf}\n\\centering\n\\caption{\\emph{Panel (a):} HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star, $\\Delta RV_{\\mathrm{Sun}}$; \\emph{Panel (b):} Scaled basis function for the suppression of convective blueshift, $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{conv}}$, derived from SDO/HMI images; \\emph{Panel (c):} Scaled basis function for the rotational Doppler imbalance due to spots and faculae, $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{phot}}$; \\emph{Panel (d):} total RV model, $\\Delta RV_{\\mathrm{model}}$ (red/lighter shade, with errors including additional variance $s$), overlaid on top of the HARPS RV variations (blue/darker shade points); \\emph{Panel (e):} residuals obtained after subtracting the model from the observations.

The SDO/HMI images were exposed for 45 seconds each, while the HARPS observations were exposed for 15 minutes and binned nightly. We expect these differences to result in a small night-to-night uncorrelated noise contribution. In addition, this variance term will absorb any residual signal of Vesta's axial rotation, which will naturally not be completely sinusoidal. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each value of $s$, the basis functions are orthogonalised by subtracting their inverse-variance weighted means prior to performing the scaling.\nWe determine the maximum likelihood via a procedure similar to the one described in \\citet{CollierCameron:2006fx}, whereby we maximise the likelihood $\\mathcal{L}$ of the solution:\n\n", "index": 57, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\ln \\mathcal{L}  = - \\frac{n}{2} \\ln(2\\pi) -\\frac{1}{2} \\, \\chi^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\, \\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} \\ln(\\sigma^2_i+s^2)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E29.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\ln\\mathcal{L}=-\\frac{n}{2}\\ln(2\\pi)-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\chi^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\sum_{%&#10;i=1}^{i=n}\\ln(\\sigma^{2}_{i}+s^{2})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2112</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mfrac><mi>n</mi><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>\u03c7</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></munderover><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>i</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>s</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05651.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nThe values at the time of each HARPS observation are listed in Table~A1. \nThe variations in $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$ are shown in panel (b) of Figure~\\ref{variations}, together with the nightly-averaged HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star, in panel (a). We see that the variations in the disc-averaged magnetic flux are in phase with the RV variations, despite the scatter in RV in the first part of the run (discussed in Section~\\ref{instrument}). If we only consider the observations in the second part of the run, the Spearman correlation coefficient between $\\Delta RV_{{\\rm Sun}}$ and $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$ is 0.80 (see Figure~\\ref{correlation}).\nThe correlation is stronger between $\\hat{v}_{{\\rm conv}}$ and $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$, with a correlation coefficient of 0.87. This is expected since magnetised areas are known to suppress convective blueshift (see \\citet{Meunier:2010hc, 2010A&A...519A..66M}). \n\n We note that these observations were taken close to the solar cycle maximum, during which the solar photosphere was mostly dominated by a few large sunspot groups (surrounded by facular networks).  \\cite{2010A&A...519A..66M} found that the convective shift attenuation is greater in larger structures, since they contain a stronger magnetic field. The relationship between convective shift attenuation and magnetic field, however, is not linear. We thus expect larger RV variations for a few large active regions than when the Sun is in a phase of lower magnetic activity, when the photosphere might be dominated by several smaller structures, even though they would still give the same total flux.\nIn fact, \\citet{Lanza2015} find a much weaker correlation between the mean total magnetic flux measured by the SOLIS VSM instrument and RV (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.131) over their 8-year dataset, which spans both active and less active phases of the solar cycle.\n\n\nWhen compared against correlations with the traditional spectroscopic activity indicators (the FWHM, BIS and $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$), we see that the disc-averaged magnetic flux $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$ is a much more effective predictor of activity-induced RV variations, over the timescale of a few rotation periods.\nThe averaged magnetic flux may therefore be a useful proxy for activity-driven RV variations as it should map onto areas of strong magnetic fields, which suppress the Sun's convective blueshift. \nThe line-of-sight magnetic flux density and filling factor on the visible hemisphere of a star can be measured from the Zeeman broadening of magnetically-sensitive lines \\citep{Robinson:1980dm, Reiners:2013kr}. Their product gives the disc-averaged flux density that we are deriving from the solar images.\nWe note that such measurements are still very difficult to make for other stars than the Sun, because the Zeeman splitting of magnetically sensitive lines is so small that the technique can only be applied to bright, slowly rotating stars. Fortunately, such stars are also the best targets for planet searches.\n\n\\subsection{Magnetic filling factor $f$}\nIn addition to the disc-averaged observed magnetic flux, we also computed the filling factor of magnetic regions on the solar disc. It is weighted by the foreshortening at the location of each pixel, and counted as a fraction of the total pixel count:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 65002, "prevtext": "\nwith respect to $s$, where $\\chi^2$ is the chi-squared value of the $n$ HARPS data points, with uncertainties $\\sigma_i$.\nThis procedure is applied to the unbinned (not nightly-averaged) HARPS dataset, in order to determine the appropriate scaling coefficients ($C$ and $S$) for Vesta's axial rotation (see Equation~\\ref{eqn6}). The total amplitude of the modulation induced by Vesta's rotation is equal to 2.39~m~s$^{-1}$, which is of the same order as the amplitude we estimated in Section~\\ref{axial}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Agreement between HARPS observations and SDO-derived model}\nAfter all the scaling coefficients were determined, we grouped the observations in each night by computing the inverse variance-weighted average for each night. The final model is shown in Figure~\\ref{all}. \n\n\n\nWe list the best-fit values of the scaling parameters for each of the basis functions in Table~\\ref{table}. We note that the values of $A$ and $B$, which represent the difference in response of HARPS and SDO to the Doppler imbalance and the suppression of convective blueshift, differ from unity.\nThe HMI/SDO images are based on measurements of a single spectral line, namely the Fe {\\sc I} 6173\\AA~line, which may not be representative of the several thousand lines from which the HARPS RVs are derived. \nThe value of $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ is determined by the contrast between the magnetic elements (spots, faculae) and the quiet-Sun photosphere. Most of the lines in the HARPS mask lie blueward of Fe {\\sc I} 6173\\AA\\ where the contrast is greater for both types of feature. We therefore expect to have to scale the SDO-derived $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ by a factor of order, but greater than, unity. We measure it to be $2.45 \\pm 2.02$; the amplitude of $\\Delta \\hat{v}_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ is so small that $A$ cannot be distinguished from unity when the additional variance $s$ is taken into account.\nThe strength of the convection inhibition changes with line depth (\\emph{cf.} \\citet{2009ApJ...697.1032G} and \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M}). We find that the HARPS response to suppression of granular blueshift is $1.85 \\pm 0.27$ times greater than we predict from SDO.\n\n \n We show a plot of the observed HARPS RVs ($\\Delta RV_{\\mathrm{Sun}}$) \\emph{vs.} our SDO-modelled RVs ($\\Delta RV_{\\mathrm{model}}$) in Figure~\\ref{comparison}, in a similar fashion to Figure 9 of \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M}. We see good agreement between the data and the model. The Spearman correlation coefficient is 0.64 for the full dataset and 0.87 when considering only the second part of the run. This is close to, although not as good as the correlation coefficient of 0.94 found by \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M} between simulated velocities of \\cite{Meunier:2010hc} and MDI/SOHO Dopplergrams.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 0.35\\textwidth]{comparison}\n\\centering\n\\caption{HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star \\emph{vs.} our model derived from SDO/HMI images.

Foreshortening and limb darkening affect the Ca {\\sc II} HK emission cores and the brightness-weighted line-of-sight granular velocities in different ways. Near the limb, the Ca {\\sc II} emission in plages originates in higher, hotter regions of the chromosphere and remains bright. The limb darkening of facular pixels is less than that of quiet-sun pixels, but near the limb the line-of-sight component of the radial motion of bright granule cores is reduced by foreshortening. The disc-averaged line-of-sight magnetic field strength is attenuated by both foreshortening and limb darkening in approximately the same way as the radial motion of the granular flow. This may explain why, even though the RVs and $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ values were measured simultaneously from the same spectra, the correlation between the variations in $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ and suppression of granular blueshift appears weak. \nIn their study of long-term solar RV variations spanning over 8 years, \\citet{Lanza2015} \nfind a stronger correlation between $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ and RV variations, with a Spearman coefficient of 0.357. This positive correlation is in agreement with previous studies of quiet late-type stars \\citep{2012A&A...541A...9G,Lovis:2011vq}, and shows that the $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ may be a more useful proxy for long-term RV variations induced the stellar magnetic cycle.\n\nWe note that in Figure~\\ref{correlation}, the variations in $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$ look similar to the variations in RV, except that they are shifted by a few days (this is especially noticeable towards the end of the run). The reality and origin of this shift will be the subject of future studies, thanks to the wealth of Sun as-a-star RV observations that are currently being gathered by the solar telescope at HARPS-N.\n\n\n\\subsection{Disc-averaged observed magnetic flux $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$}\nWe compute the full-disc line-of-sight magnetic flux of the Sun, by summing the intensity-weighted line-of-sight unsigned magnetic flux in each pixel:\n\n", "index": 59, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}| = \\frac{\\sum_{ij} |B_{{\\rm obs}, ij}| \\, I_{ij}}{\\sum_{ij} I_{ij}}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E30.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|=\\frac{\\sum_{ij}|B_{{\\rm obs},ij}|\\,I_{ij}}{\\sum_{ij}I_{ij}}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>obs</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mrow><mi>obs</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></mrow></msub><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mi>I</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05651.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $N_{\\rm pix}$ is the total number of pixels in the solar disc and the weight $W_{ij}$ is set to 1 in magnetically active regions, and 0 in the quiet Sun. The variations of the filling factor are shown in panel (c) of Figure~\\ref{variations}. As expected, they follow the disc-averaged magnetic flux closely. The correlation with the predicted $\\Delta RV_{{\\rm conv}}$ and the observed $\\Delta RV_{{\\rm Sun}}$ is nonetheless weaker than that found for the brightness-weighted line-of-sight magnetic field $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$, since no correction is made for limb darkening. \n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn the present analysis, we decomposed activity-induced radial-velocity (RV) variations into identifiable contributions from sunspots, faculae and granulation, based on Sun as-a-star RV variations deduced from  HARPS spectra of the bright asteroid Vesta and high spatial resolution images in the Fe {\\sc I} 6173~\\AA~line taken with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). \nWe find that the RV variations induced by solar activity are mainly caused by the suppression of convective blueshift from magnetically active regions, while the flux deficit incurred by the presence of sunspots on the rotating solar disc only plays a minor role. We further compute the disc-averaged line-of-sight magnetic flux and show that although we cannot yet measure it with precision on other stars at present, it is a very good proxy for activity-driven RV variations, much more so than the full width at half-maximum and bisector span of the cross-correlation profile, and the Ca II H\\&K activity index. These findings are in agreement with the previous works of \\citet{Meunier:2010hc} and \\citet{2010A&A...519A..66M}.\n\nIn addition to the existing 2011 HARPS observations of sunlight scattered off Vesta, there will soon be a wealth of direct solar RV measurements taken with HARPS-N, which will be regularly fed sunlight through a small 2-inch telescope developed specifically for this purpose. A prototype for this is currently being commissioned at HARPS-N (see \\citet{2015ApJ...814L..21D}, \\citeauthor{Glenday2015} \\citetext{in prep.}).\nGaining a deeper understanding of the physics at the heart of activity-driven RV variability will ultimately enable us to better model and remove this contribution from RV observations, thus revealing the planetary signals.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nWe wish to thank the referee for their thoughtful comments, which have greatly helped improve the analysis presented in this paper.\nRDH gratefully acknowledges STFC studentship grant number\nST/J500744/1, and a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.

observation are listed in Table~A1. \nThe variations in $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$ are shown in panel (b) of Figure~\\ref{variations}, together with the nightly-averaged HARPS RV variations of the Sun as-a-star, in panel (a). We see that the variations in the disc-averaged magnetic flux are in phase with the RV variations, despite the scatter in RV in the first part of the run (discussed in Section~\\ref{instrument}). If we only consider the observations in the second part of the run, the Spearman correlation coefficient between $\\Delta RV_{{\\rm Sun}}$ and $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$ is 0.80 (see Figure~\\ref{correlation}).\nThe correlation is stronger between $\\hat{v}_{{\\rm conv}}$ and $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$, with a correlation coefficient of 0.87. This is expected since magnetised areas are known to suppress convective blueshift (see \\citet{Meunier:2010hc, 2010A&A...519A..66M}). \n\n We note that these observations were taken close to the solar cycle maximum, during which the solar photosphere was mostly dominated by a few large sunspot groups (surrounded by facular networks).  \\cite{2010A&A...519A..66M} found that the convective shift attenuation is greater in larger structures, since they contain a stronger magnetic field. The relationship between convective shift attenuation and magnetic field, however, is not linear. We thus expect larger RV variations for a few large active regions than when the Sun is in a phase of lower magnetic activity, when the photosphere might be dominated by several smaller structures, even though they would still give the same total flux.\nIn fact, \\citet{Lanza2015} find a much weaker correlation between the mean total magnetic flux measured by the SOLIS VSM instrument and RV (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.131) over their 8-year dataset, which spans both active and less active phases of the solar cycle.\n\n\nWhen compared against correlations with the traditional spectroscopic activity indicators (the FWHM, BIS and $\\log(R'_{\\rm HK})$), we see that the disc-averaged magnetic flux $|\\hat{B}_{\\rm obs}|$ is a much more effective predictor of activity-induced RV variations, over the timescale of a few rotation periods.\nThe averaged magnetic flux may therefore be a useful proxy for activity-driven RV variations as it should map onto areas of strong magnetic fields, which suppress the Sun's convective blueshift. \nThe line-of-sight magnetic flux density and filling factor on the visible hemisphere of a star can be measured from the Zeeman broadening of magnetically-sensitive lines \\citep{Robinson:1980dm, Reiners:2013kr}. Their product gives the disc-averaged flux density that we are deriving from the solar images.\nWe note that such measurements are still very difficult to make for other stars than the Sun, because the Zeeman splitting of magnetically sensitive lines is so small that the technique can only be applied to bright, slowly rotating stars. Fortunately, such stars are also the best targets for planet searches.\n\n\\subsection{Magnetic filling factor $f$}\nIn addition to the disc-averaged observed magnetic flux, we also computed the filling factor of magnetic regions on the solar disc. It is weighted by the foreshortening at the location of each pixel, and counted as a fraction of the total pixel count:\n\n", "index": 61, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nf = \\frac{1}{N_{\\rm pix}} \\, \\sum_{ij} W_{ij},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E31.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f=\\frac{1}{N_{\\rm pix}}\\,\\sum_{ij}W_{ij},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>pix</mi></msub></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></munder><msub><mi>W</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
