The emission spectra, dominated by excitonic effects, display the expected in plane\nanisotropy. The emission energy depends on the type of substrate on which the flake is placed due to the different\ndielectric screening. Finally, the blue shift of the emission with increasing temperature is well described using a two\noscillator model for the temperature dependence of the band gap.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\nBlack phosphorus, the most stable of all the allotropes of phosphorus, has been intensively studied by different\nexperimental methods from the early fifties of the last\ncentury.\\cite{Keyes53,warschauer1963electrical,Maruyama81,Asahina83,Jamieson63,Wittig68,Sugai85} Bulk black phosphorus\nis a semiconductor, with a band gap of about \\SI{0.335}{\\eV}.\\cite{Keyes53,Asahina83} The orthorombic bulk crystal has\na layered structure, with atomic layers bound by weak van der Waals interactions. A single atomic layer is puckered,\nwith the phosphorous atoms being parallel in the (010) plane.\\cite{Narita83,Takao81,Maruyama81} Atomically thin\nmonolayers have been recently isolated using mechanical exfoliation,\\cite{Castellanos14} adding black phosphorus to the\nrapidly growing family of emerging two dimensional materials. The band gap of black phosphorus is always direct and can\nbe tuned from \\SI{0.3}{\\eV} to the nearly visible part of the spectrum\\cite{Tran14,ling2015}. In contrast, graphene is\ngapless,\\cite{Novoselov05} and the transition metals dichalcogenides (TMDs) have an indirect gap in bulk phase and only\nmonolayer TMDs have a direct gap.\\cite{Wang12} Moreover, black phosphorus exhibits a strong in-plane\nanisotropy\\cite{Tran14,Low14,xia14,Qiao14,ling2015}, absent in graphene and TMDs. Additionally, the relatively high\nmobilities measured at room temperature combined with the direct band gap result in an on/off ratio for FET transistors\nof the order of 10$^{5}$. \\cite{ling2015,li14,Liu14}\n\nAlthough black phosphorus has a wide range of possible applications, including tunable photodetectors\\cite{Buscema15},\nfield effect transistors\\cite{xia14,ling2015,li14,Liu14} or photon polarizers\\cite{Tran14,Low14,xia14,Qiao14,ling2015},\nmany of its electronic properties are not yet fully understood. The main difficulty arises from the sensitivity of\nblack phosphorus to its environment, notably its high reactivity when exposed to air and laser\nlight.\\cite{Castellanos14,Koenig14,Gan15} Theoretical calculations predict a band gap of few layer black phosphorus\nranging from \\SI{1}{\\eV} \\cite{Liu14,Tran14} to \\SI{2.15}{\\eV} \\cite{Castellanos14,Tran14}, with a binding energy of\nthe neutral exciton of \\SI{0.8}{\\eV} in vacuum \\cite{Tran14} and of \\SI{0.38}{\\eV} when placed on a Si/SiO$_{2}$\nsubstrate \\cite{Castellanos14}. The measured photoluminescence (PL) emission energy from bi-layers black phosphorus is\nbetween \\SI{1.2}{\\eV} \\cite{Zhang14} and \\SI{1.6}{\\eV} \\cite{Castellanos14}, while monolayer black phosphorus shows\nneutral exciton emission around \\SI{1.3}{\\eV} \\cite{wang2015highly}, \\SI{1.45}{\\eV} \\cite{Liu14} or \\SI{1.76}{\\eV}\n\\cite{Yang15}. The latter value was related to the simultaneous observation of charged exciton emission at around\n\\SI{1.62}{\\eV}.\\cite{Yang15} Using scanning tunneling microscopy the band gap of a single layer of black phosphorus was\nestimated to be \\SI{2.05}{\\eV}.\\cite{liang2014electronic} The exciton binding energy and consequently the emission\nenergy strongly depend on the dielectric environment (substrate) \\cite{Castellanos14,Woomer15}. This could partially\nexplain the wide range of values for the black phosphorus emission energy found in the literature, possibly related\nalso to a slightly different composition of the SiO$_2$ substrates employed.\n\nMoreover, owing to the limited life time of the samples, the various\ncharacterization techniques used to identify monolayer black phosphorus (\\emph{e.g.\\ }atomic force microscopy, Raman\nspectroscopy) could not always be performed \\emph{on the same flake} where the optical response was investigated.\n\n\n\nIn this paper we present a systematic investigation of the optical properties of monolayer of black phosphorus. We\nanalyze the properties of the emission as a function of the dielectric constant of the substrate, excitation power,\npolarization and temperature. The single layer character of the investigated flakes is demonstrated using \\emph{in\nsitu} Raman measurements on the same flake used for the PL. We show that the PL emission energy of monolayer black\nphosphorus depends on the substrate used. The PL spectra, dominated by excitonic effects, exhibit the expected in plane\nanisotropy. Finally, the blue shift of the emission energy with an increasing temperature is well described with a\ntwo-oscillator model for the temperature dependence of the band gap.\n\n\nSingle and few layer black phosphorus flakes have been obtained by mechanical exfoliation of a bulk crystal, purchased\nfrom Smart Elements (99.998\\% nominal purity). The mechanical exfoliation was performed in a glove box filled with\nargon (Ar) gas ($<\\SI{1}{ppm}$ O$_2$, $<\\SI{1}{ppm}$ H$_2$O). The flakes were subsequently transferred onto a Si\nsubstrate, in most cases capped with a \\SI{300}{\\nano\\m} thick layer of SiO$_2$ (Si/SiO$_2$ hereafter). The samples\nwere stored in vials, in the glove box, before their transfer to the cryostat under an Ar atmosphere.\n\nFor the optical measurements, the samples were mounted on the cold finger of a He-flow cryostat, which was then rapidly\npumped to a pressure below $\\SI{1e-4}{\\milli\\bar}$, minimizing the exposure of the black phosphorus to air. The\nexcitation was provided by a frequency-doubled diode laser, emitting at \\SI{532}{\\nano\\m} and focused on the sample by\na 50$\\times$ microscope objective (0.55 numerical aperture), yielding a spot size of $\\sim\\SI{1}{\\micro\\m}$. The PL and\nRaman signals were collected through the same objective and analyzed by a spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen\ncooled Si CCD camera.\n\n\n\nRaman spectroscopy, which has been shown to be a very precise tool for the determination of the number of layers in\nTMDs \\cite{Lee10,Gutierrez13,Li12a,Li12,Wang12} and in graphene, \\cite{Ferrari06,Gupta06} can also be used to identify\nmonolayer black phosphorus. Bulk black phosphorus belongs to the $D_{2h}^{18}$ space group. Of the 12 normal modes at\nthe $\\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone, six are Raman active.\\cite{Sugai81,Sugai85} The two B$_{3g}$ modes are\nforbidden in back scattering configuration and the B$_{1g}$ mode at \\SI{194}{\\centi\\m^{-1}} is very weak. Therefore,\nonly three Raman modes are expected for bulk black phosphorus: A$_{g}^{1}$, A$_{g}^{2}$ and B$_{2g}$ at around\n\\SI{365}{\\centi\\m^{-1}}, \\SI{470}{\\centi\\m^{-1}} and \\SI{442}{\\centi\\m^{-1}}, respectively.\\cite{Sugai81,Sugai85} The\nA$_{g}^{2}$ and B$_{2g}$ modes are related to the in plane vibrations of the atoms, while A$_{g}^{1}$ mode is related\nto the out of plane movement of the atoms~\\cite{Sugai81,Sugai85}.\n\nTypical calibrated micro Raman (\\si{\\micro}Raman) spectra of the bulk and single layer black phosphorus are presented\nin Fig.\\ \\ref{Figure_Raman}. For the bulk crystal three strong peaks are observed at \\SI{363.7}{\\centi\\m^{-1}},\n\\SI{440.3}{\\centi\\m^{-1}} and \\SI{467.5}{\\centi\\m^{-1}} corresponding well to the expected main Raman modes. A further\npeak was systematically observed at \\SI{520}{\\centi\\m^{-1}} (Raman mode of the Si substrate, not shown here),\nconfirming the correct calibration of our Raman setup. The slight shift towards lower frequencies can be related to the\nlow temperature (\\SI{4}{\\K}) at which our measurements have been carried out, which shifts the characteristic Raman\nfeatures towards lower frequencies \\cite{Zhang14}. Under low excitation power (\\SI{17}{\\micro\\W}), initially used to\navoid any risk of inducing damage by exposure to the laser light, the Raman spectrum of the monolayer flake is similar\nto that of the bulk crystal. This suggests that the monolayer black phosphorus remains crystalline and no oxidization\noccurred during the transfer of the sample from the glove box to the cryostat. Compared to bulk, the A$_{g}^{1}$ mode\ndoes not shift within experimental error. In contrast, the position of A$_{g}^{2}$ and B$_{2g}$ Raman modes shift to\nhigher frequencies in the monolayer flake. The A$_{g}^{2}$ mode shifts by $1.7\\pm$\\SI{0.2}{\\centi\\m^{-1}} while the\nB$_{2g}$ shifts by 1.0$\\pm$\\SI{0.2}{\\centi\\m^{-1}}. The change of the energy of the Raman modes as a function of the\nnumber of layers in black phosphorus has been already shown for both high \\cite{Favron15,Castellanos14,Liu14} and low\nfrequency modes \\cite{Luo15}. The shifts we measure are in good agreement with the reported values for single layer\nblack phosphorus ($\\sim\\SI{1.9}{\\centi\\m^{-1}}$ and between $\\sim\\SI{1.0}{\\centi\\m^{-1}}$ and\n$\\sim\\SI{1.6}{\\centi\\m^{-1}}$ for A$_{g}^{2}$ \\cite{Favron15,Castellanos14,Liu14,lu2014plasma} and B$_{2g}$\n\\cite{Favron15,Castellanos14}, respectively) demonstrating the single layer character of the investigated flake. Raman\nmeasured at high excitation power (\\SI{260}{\\micro\\W}, the same as used for the bulk crystal) does not show any\nadditional features; the peak positions remain the same as for the data obtained for low excitation power. Thus there\nis no sign of laser induced chemical modification of our samples,\\cite{Castellanos14} which is important since the\nexcitation intensity used here is comparable to that used in our micro PL (\\si{\\micro}PL) spectroscopy measurements.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{FigureRamanDotted}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{(Color online) Typical \\si{\\micro}Raman spectra of bulk and single layer black phosphorus measured at $T=\\SI{4}{\\K}$\nfor different excitation powers as indicated.

The measurement was performed without removing the flake from the\ncryostat, which was maintained under vacuum. The spectrum is dominated by a very strong emission line centered at\naround \\SI{2}{\\eV} identified with neutral exciton recombination. This line is consistently observed at this energy for\nall flakes transferred to Si/SiO$_2$ substrates. The typical full width at half maximum is of\n$\\lesssim\\SI{90}{\\milli\\eV}$ (line broadening induced by scattering with vacancies and impurities in the exfoliated\nflakes). The observed value of the exciton recombination energy is relatively high as compared to the theoretical band\ngap of $2.15$\\,eV computed for black phosphorus single layer \\cite{Castellanos14,Tran14} and is somewhat larger than\nthe values already reported for black phosphorus single layers of $\\eqsim\n1.3-\\SI{1.76}{\\eV}$ \\cite{Liu14,Yang15,wang2015highly}. This could be partly ascribed to the different stoichiometry of the\nSiO$_2$ layers used as a substrate, which induces a shift in the emission because of the different dielectric constant\nof the surrounding medium.\\cite{choi2007solvatochromism} To verify this hypothesis, we have transferred black\nphosphorus flakes onto a Si substrate covered by a thin ($\\sim\\SI{2}{\\nano\\m}$) layer of native oxide. Such a substrate\nhas a larger dielectric constant than the standard Si/SiO$_2$ substrates. Thus, the exciton binding energy is expected\nto be lower and the emission energy should be blue shifted. A typical \\si{\\micro}PL spectrum of a flake transferred onto a Si\nsubstrate is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:PL_substrate}(a). While the main spectral features resemble those of a flake on a\nSi/SiO$_2$ substrate, there is a large shift of the emission energy of $\\sim\\SI{80}{\\milli\\eV}$. This confirms the\ndependence of the emission energy on the dielectric environment, in agreement with previous\nresults.\\cite{Castellanos14,Woomer15} The effect of the dielectric environment seems to be stronger than for atomically\nthin TMDs, in agreement with theory and experiment.\\cite{Lin14}\n\nIn the spectrum measured on a standard Si/SiO$_2$ substrate, in addition to the neutral exciton recombination, we\nobserved additional features at $\\sim\\SI{1.84}{\\eV}$, which can be attributed to charged exciton recombination\n(systematically present in all the investigated flakes)\\cite{Yang15} together with a low energy peak, typically at\n$\\sim\\SI{1.72}{\\eV}$, and possibly related to excitons bound to impurities. The low energy feature is not always\npresent, see \\emph{e.g.\\ }the \\si{\\micro}PL spectrum on a Si substrate in Fig.~\\ref{fig:PL_substrate}(a).\n\nBecause of the low symmetry of the crystal structure and the screening in black phosphorus,\\cite{Tran14,\nli2014electrons} the exciton wave function is expected to be squeezed along the armchair direction, resulting in a\npolarization dependent PL emission.\\cite{wang2015highly} The linear polarization dependence of the emission of our\nflakes was investigated by mounting polarizers/analyzers in both the excitation and the detection paths. Regardless of\nthe polarization of the excitation beam, whenever the analyzer in the detection path was set to vertical (V), the\nintensity of the detected signal was a maximum, which is consistent with the strongly anisotropic nature of the exciton\nin black phosphorus \\cite{wang2015highly}. For example, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:PL_substrate}(b), we show \\si{\\micro}PL spectra\nexcited with a horizontally (H) polarized laser light and detected with either H or V direction of the analyzer.\nMoreover, for any fixed orientation of the analyzer in the detection path, the detected signal is always stronger when\nthe analyzer in the excitation path was set to the H direction. This stems from the polarization dependent absorption\nproperties of black phosphorus \\cite{xia14}.\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{PLsubstratesPolarization}\n    \\end{center}\n\\caption{(Color online) (a) Low temperature \\si{\\micro}PL spectra of black phosphorus flakes on Si/SiO$_2$ and Si substrates.\nX labels the neutral exciton transition, T the charged exciton and L the localized exciton.

We have measured the power dependence of the \\si{\\micro}PL spectra for several black\nphosphorus monolayer flakes. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:Pdependence}(a) we show representative spectra measured at low,\nintermediate, and high excitation powers $P$ at $T=\\SI{4.2}{\\K}$. Even after exciting with $P>\\SI{1}{\\milli\\W}$, the\nemission efficiency did not decrease for any of the investigated samples, suggesting that our preparation method helps\nimprove the stability of the exfoliated black phosphorus flakes. Two peaks appear in the spectra of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:Pdependence}(a) for all excitation powers used. The neutral exciton peak slightly blue shifts at high\nexcitation powers ($\\lesssim\\SI{2}{\\milli\\eV}$), possibly due to a localized heating effect induced by the high power\nof the incoming laser beam (see also below for a discussion of temperature dependence of the black phosphorus PL).\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:Pdependence}(b) we present the dependence of the integrated PL intensity of neutral and charged\nexcitons as a function of the excitation power. At low excitation power, both intensities increase linearly with the\npower, as demonstrated by the fits to the power law $I\\propto P^n$, with $n=0.97\\pm0.03$ for the neutral exciton and\n$n=0.93\\pm0.03$ for the charged exciton. At higher excitation power (not shown), both excitonic lines saturate at\napproximately the same level of excitation power ($P=\\SI{1}{\\milli\\W}$), confirming that the two observed transitions\nare related to the recombination of a single electron-hole pair.\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n    \\begin{center}\n        \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{Pdependence}\n    \\end{center}\n\\caption{(Color online) (a) \\si{\\micro}PL spectra of a black phosphorus single layer measured at different excitation powers.\n(b) Integrated intensity of the charged (T) and neutral (X) exciton emission versus excitation power. The solid lines\nare fits to a power law described in the text.} \\label{fig:Pdependence}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nIn view of the potential use of black phosphorus in a wide variety of electronic and optoelectronic applications, we\nhave investigated the temperature dependence of its optical properties. In Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:Tdependence}(a) we show\nnormalized \\si{\\micro}PL spectra measured at different temperatures. With increasing temperature the charged exciton\npeak broadens. The neutral exciton emission blue shifts (measured ${\\mathop{}\\!\\text{d}} E_{\\text{g}}/{\\mathop{}\\!\\text{d}} T\\sim\\SI{3.1e-4}{\\eV/\\K}$\nbetween \\SI{40}{\\K} and \\SI{160}{\\K}), which is consistent with earlier reports of the temperature dependence of the\nband gap of bulk black phosphorus (${\\mathop{}\\!\\text{d}} E_{\\text{g}}/{\\mathop{}\\!\\text{d}} T=\\SI{2.8e-4}{\\eV/\\K}$ \\cite{warschauer1963electrical} or\n\\SI{2.33e-4}{\\eV/\\K} \\cite{baba1991photoconduction}). The behavior of the emission energy of the excitonic peak is\nshown more in detail in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Tdependence}(b). In bulk semiconductors, the variation of the band gap as a\nfunction of the temperature is direct consequence of the renormalization of the band gap via the electron-phonon\ninteraction and of the thermal expansion of the lattice.\\cite{cardona2005isotope} In general, the resulting effect is a\ndecrease of the band gap with increasing temperature. Exceptions to this general behavior include lead salts\n\\cite{laff1965photoeffects,dai2010size,dey2013origin} and copper halides.\\cite{gobel1998effects,cardona2014temperature}\nWhile the role of thermal expansion\\cite{allen1983temperature} is often neglected\\cite{dey2013origin}, a variety of\napproaches has been proposed to fit the temperature dependence of the band gap\\cite{o1991temperature}, which sometimes\nfail to provide physical insight for the extracted fitting parameters. A more useful approach to the fit the\ntemperature dependence of the band gap requires in principle the knowledge of the details of the phonon density of\nstates and of the electron-phonon coupling constants, which makes this treatment somewhat cumbersome.  In a simplified\napproach, the essential features of the electron-phonon interaction are accounted for by considering contributions only\nat energies where the phonon density of states displays sharp peaks (two-oscillator\nmodel).\\cite{vina1984temperature,cardona2014temperature,dey2013origin,lian2006effects} In this framework, the band gap\n$E_{\\text{g}}$ is approximated by\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nE_{\\text{g}}(T)=E_0+E_1\\left(\\frac{2}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{e}}^{\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_1}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}} T}}-1}+1\\right) +\nE_2\\left(\\frac{2}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{e}}^{\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_2}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}} T}}-1}+1\\right), \\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"E_{\\text{g}}(T)=E_{0}+E_{1}\\left(\\frac{2}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{e}}^{\\frac{\\hbar%&#10;\\omega_{1}}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{k_{\\mathrm{B}}}}T}}-1}+1\\right)+E_{2}\\left(%&#10;\\frac{2}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{e}}^{\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{2}}{{\\mathop{}\\!\\mathrm{k%&#10;_{\\mathrm{B}}}}T}}-1}+1\\right),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mtext>g</mtext></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"-1.7pt\"><mi/></mpadded><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u210f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"-1.7pt\"><mi/></mpadded><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">k</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mrow></mfrac></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"-1.7pt\"><mi/></mpadded><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u210f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"-1.7pt\"><mi/></mpadded><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">k</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mrow></mfrac></msup></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
