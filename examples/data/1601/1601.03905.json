The most widely considered is the Symanzik\nstrategy~\\cite{Symanzik}, where irrelevant operators of increasing dimension are added\nto the standard action, with coefficients determined perturbatively or not.\nAnother, less common, strategy is motivated by the observation that the\napproach to the continuum behavior is faster for weaker fields: suppressing\nstrong fields will improve the action in a non-parametric way. Indeed,\nthe Manton action~\\cite{Manton}, or renormalization-group improved actions like the\n``perfect'' action~\\cite{perfect} all suppress large fields.\n\nA radical implementation of this second strategy consists of imposing\na cutoff on the amount of local excitation, the earliest example being\nthe positive-plaquette action~\\cite{positive}. Recently, a combination of Wilson-type\naction and cutoff constraint has been shown to display much improved scaling\nin a spin model~\\cite{Bern_XY}. Very recently, a similar approach has been\napplied to a gauge theory~\\cite{Bern_SU2}. \n\nThis leaves open the question of the approach to the continuum limit of\na constraint-only action, namely an action $S$ such that $\\exp(-S) = 1$\nif every local constraint is satisfied, $0$ otherwise. Such an action,\nwhich is invariant under small deformations of the field, is for this\nreason called ``topological''. While it is intuitively clear that the\ncorrelation length will keep increasing as the constraint selects \nweaker and weaker fields, it is not at all obvious which continuum theory\nwill be approached: a gradient expansion of the lattice action is not\npossible, since the action is either zero or infinite.\nNevertheless, it has been shown numerically~\\cite{top_XY} that in a \n$2d$ $XY$ spin model,\nthe same Coulomb phase is obtained as with the standard  action.\nHere, we study the case of a $4d$ $U(1)$ gauge theory, and compare\nthe Wilson action $S_W = - \\beta \\sum_P \\cos \\theta_P$ with the \ntopological action \n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\exp(-S_{\\rm top}) = \\prod_P \\Theta(\\delta - |\\theta_P|)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\exp(-S_{\\rm top})=\\prod_{P}\\Theta(\\delta-|\\theta_{P}|)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>top</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u220f</mo><mi>P</mi></munder><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0398</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>P</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03905.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $f$ is the free energy density and $\\phi_{\\mu\\nu}$ is an external flux through the $(\\mu,\\nu)$ planes.\nIn a massive (confining) phase, $h$ goes to zero exponentially with the system size.\nIn a massless (Coulomb) phase, it can be non-zero in the thermodynamic limit.\nThus, it can be used as an order parameter in the $4d$ $U(1)$ theory, as shown\nin \\cite{Vetto}. \nWhile $h$ can be expressed as a simple expectation value with the Wilson action,\nwith the topological action it cannot.

In the Coulomb phase, monopoles\nare exponentially suppressed: the density of monopole current behaves\nas $\\exp(-\\beta_R M)$, where $M$ can be considered as the monopole mass.\nFig.~3 (left) shows this exponential suppression, for both actions.\nWith the topological action, monopoles are much heavier, i.e. more suppressed.\nThis is evidence that the topological action is {\\em improved}: for a given\nvalue of the renormalized coupling, lattice artifacts are reduced considerably.\n\nActually, as explained in Sec.~2, with the topological action monopoles\ncannot exist if the cutoff $\\delta$ on the plaquette angle is $\\pi/3$ or less.\nThus, the density of monopole current vanishes, and is singular at \n$\\delta = \\pi/3$. We tried to monitor this singular behavior. As $\\delta$\napproaches $\\pi/3$, the density of monopole current deviates from the \nexponential behavior of Fig.~3 (left) and seems to obey a power law,\nbeing proportional to $(\\cos(\\pi/3) - \\cos(\\delta))^\\gamma$.\nSee Fig.~3 (right). We measure a large value $\\sim 12$ for \nthe ``critical exponent'' $\\gamma$, which can be explained heuristically.\n\nConsider first a $2d$ $XY$ model, with topological action\n$\\exp(-S_{\\rm top}) = \\prod_{\\langle ij \\rangle} \\Theta(\\delta - |\\theta_i - \\theta_j|)$. Vortices in this model come from the spin orientation $\\theta_i$\nwinding by $2\\pi$ as one goes around an elementary plaquette. Thus,\nvortices cannot exist if $\\delta < \\pi/2$. When $\\delta$ just exceeds $\\pi/2$,\neach angle $|\\theta_i - \\theta_j|$ around a vortex must be near $\\pi/2$,\nwithin an angle $(\\delta - \\pi/2)$ of it. The phase space for this is\n$\\propto (\\delta - \\pi/2)$. Since there are 4 links around a vortex,\nrelated by one constraint (the sum of the four $(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$\nis $2\\pi$), the phase space for a vortex is $\\propto (\\delta - \\pi/2)^3$.\nNow, on a periodic lattice a vortex is always accompanied by an anti-vortex.\nThus, the probability of finding a vortex anti-vortex pair should be\n$\\propto (\\delta - \\pi/2)^6$. This is remarkably consistent with the\nmeasurements shown Fig.~4 (right). \nWe can then apply a similar argument to the $U(1)$  monopole density. \nThe smallest monopole current loop is dual to 4 cubes. \nEach cube contains 6 plaquettes, which together obey a Bianchi constraint\nso that the total outgoing flux through the 6 plaquettes is $2\\pi$.\nThus, the probability of finding such a monopole loop is\n$\\propto (\\delta - \\pi/3)^{4\\times 5}$. Our data, shown Fig.~4 (left), is\nmore consistent with an exponent $\\sim 12$, indicating that our heuristic\nargument is too crude.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\linewidth]{./u1_dens_helicity.pdf} \n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\linewidth]{./nmonop-3.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Monopole density in the Coulomb phase. {\\em Left}: The monopole\ndensity decreases exponentially as a function of the inverse renormalized \ncoupling $\\beta_R = 1/e_R^2$, both for the Wilson action and for the \ntopological action, with a steeper decrease for the latter. {\\em Right}:\nusing the topological action, the monopole density vanishes when the\nplaquette angles cannot exceed $\\pi/3$. \nAs one approaches this critical value,\nthe monopole density vanishes as a power law of the distance to the\ncritical constraint angle, with a critical exponent $\\sim 12$.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\linewidth]{./nmonop_u1.pdf} \n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\linewidth]{./nmonop_cos.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{{\\em Left}: monopole density in the Coulomb phase, for the \ntopological action, as a function of the distance to the critical constraint:\na power law is clearly visible on this log-log plot.\n{\\em Right}: similar figure showing the density of vortices in the massless\nphase of the $2d$ XY model, using a topological action.

Therefore, $Z(\\delta_2)/Z(\\delta_1)$, with $\\delta_2 < \\delta_1$,\nis the proportion of configurations satisfying the constraint $\\delta_1$ which also satisfy the\ntighter constraint $\\delta_2$. These configurations can be counted as the Monte Carlo\nsampling of $Z(\\delta_1)$ proceeds, giving the variation of the free energy $f(\\delta)$\n``for free''. \n\nWe have applied this simple strategy near the phase transition, in the $2d$ $XY$ model\nand in the $4d$ $U(1)$ gauge theory. The phase transition is of infinite order (BKT) in\nthe former case, of first-order in the latter. The results for $\\partial f(\\delta)/\\partial\\delta$,\nshown Fig.~5, make this difference clear: for the first-order transition (left), the first\nderivative of the free energy develops a discontinuity as the system size increases, \nwhile it remains smooth for the infinite-order transition.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centerline{\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\linewidth]{./dfe.pdf} \n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\linewidth]{./dfe_xy.pdf}\n}\n\\caption{Derivative of the free energy density with respect to the constraint \nangle,\nacross the confinement-Coulomb phase transition marked by the vertical line, for the $4d$ $U(1)$ gauge\ntheory ({\\em left}) and for the $2d$ $XY$ model ({\\em right}).\nAs the system size is increased, a discontinuity is clearly visible in \nthe former case, signaling a first-order transition. In contrast, the\nderivative of the free energy remains smooth in the $XY$ model, as\nexpected from a transition of infinite order.\nWith a topological action, the free energy is obtained by simply counting\nthe number of configurations which survive a tighter constraint (see text).\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nA topological action takes only two values: $0$ and $+\\infty$, where the latter removes any configuration\nwhich violates a local smoothness constraint. We have studied the properties of the topological action\n$S(\\delta) = -\\sum_P \\log \\Theta(\\delta - |\\theta_P|)$ in the $4d$ $U(1)$ gauge theory, as a function of\nthe constraint angle $\\delta$. As $\\delta\\to 0$, all plaquettes $P$ are forced to approach the identity.\nYet the approach to the continuum action $\\int d^4x F_{\\mu\\nu}^2$ is not clear a priori.\nNevertheless, we have shown that the phase diagram of this lattice theory is very similar to that obtained\nwith the Wilson action, with a confining, disordered phase at large $\\delta$, separated from a\nCoulomb, ordered phase at small $\\delta$ by a first-order transition. \nThis transition is associated with a jump in the density of magnetic monopoles, which condense\nin the confining phase and are exponentially suppressed in the Coulomb phase. \nWith the topological action, the monopole density is smaller in the Coulomb phase, which\nreflects the improvement of the action.\nThe helicity modulus serves\nboth as an order parameter for the phase transition, and as a renormalized coupling in the Coulomb\nphase.\n\nA feature specific to the topological action is the total suppression of monopoles, or of topological\ndefects in general, for a particular value of the constraint (here, $\\delta_c=\\pi/3$). This threshold\nis analogous to L\\\"uscher's ``admissibility condition'', which guarantees that topological sectors\nare distinct, even on the lattice~\\cite{Luscher}. Here, the monopole density is singular at $\\delta_c$: we observe\nthat it decreases as a high power of $(\\delta - \\delta_c)$ when $\\delta\\to\\delta_c^+$, then is\nidentically zero for $\\delta < \\delta_c$. Other effects of this phase transition, if any, remain\nto be elucidated.\n\nFinally, a topological action provides a simple means to measure the free energy, as the fraction\nof configurations in a given ensemble which continue to satisfy the constraint as this constraint\nis tightened. This might be useful in some attempts to tackle the sign problem, where the\nfree energy must be convoluted with a complex phase factor~\\cite{Langfeld}.\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{Symanzik}\n\n  K.~Symanzik,\n  \n  Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ B {\\bf 226}, 187 (1983).\n\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{Manton}\n\n  C.~Michael and M.~Teper,\n  \n  Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ B {\\bf 305}, 453 (1988).\n\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{perfect}\n\n  P.~Hasenfratz and F.~Niedermayer,\n  \n  Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ B {\\bf 414}, 785 (1994)\n\n  [hep-lat/9308004].\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{positive}\n\n  J.~Fingberg, U.~M.~Heller and V.~K.~Mitrjushkin,\n  \n  Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ B {\\bf 435}, 311 (1995)\n\n  [hep-lat/9407011].\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{Bern_XY}\n\n  J.~Balog, F.~Niedermayer, M.~Pepe, P.~Weisz and U.-J.~Wiese,\n  \n  JHEP {\\bf 1211}, 140 (2012)\n\n  [arXiv:1208.6232 [hep-lat]].\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{Bern_SU2}\n\n  D.~Banerjee, M.~B\\\"ogli, K.~Holland, F.~Niedermayer, M.~Pepe, U.~Wenger and U.~J.~Wiese,\n  \n  arXiv:1512.04984 [hep-lat].\n  \n\n\\bibitem{top_XY}\n\n  W.~Bietenholz, M.~B\\\"ogli, F.~Niedermayer, M.~Pepe, F.~G.~Rejon-Barrera and U.~J.~Wiese,\n  \n  JHEP {\\bf 1303}, 141 (2013)\n\n  [arXiv:1212.0579 [hep-lat]].\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{top_U1}\n\n  O.~Akerlund and P.~de Forcrand,\n  \n  JHEP {\\bf 1506}, 183 (2015)\n\n  [arXiv:1505.02666 [hep-lat]].\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{DeG_T}\n\n  T.~A.~DeGrand and D.~Toussaint,\n  \n  Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 22}, 2478 (1980).\n\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{Vetto}\n\n  M.~Vettorazzo and P.~de Forcrand,\n  \n  Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ B {\\bf 686}, 85 (2004)\n\n  [hep-lat/0311006].\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{Borgs}\n\n  C.~Borgs and R.~Kotecky,\n  \n  Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\  {\\bf 68}, 1734 (1992).\n\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{Luscher}\n\n  M.~Luscher,\n  \n  Commun.\\ Math.\\ Phys.\\  {\\bf 85}, 39 (1982).\n\n  \n  \n\n\\bibitem{Langfeld}\n\n  K.~Langfeld and B.~Lucini,\n  \n  Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 90}, no.9, 094502 (2014)\n\n  [arXiv:1404.7187 [hep-lat]].\n  \n  \n\n\\end{thebibliography}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 10587, "prevtext": "\nwhere $f$ is the free energy density and $\\phi_{\\mu\\nu}$ is an external flux through the $(\\mu,\\nu)$ planes.\nIn a massive (confining) phase, $h$ goes to zero exponentially with the system size.\nIn a massless (Coulomb) phase, it can be non-zero in the thermodynamic limit.\nThus, it can be used as an order parameter in the $4d$ $U(1)$ theory, as shown\nin \\cite{Vetto}. \nWhile $h$ can be expressed as a simple expectation value with the Wilson action,\nwith the topological action it cannot.
