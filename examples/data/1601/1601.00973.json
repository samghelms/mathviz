Our prediction obtained with a \nQCD-based kernel agrees with the data on $x\\gtrsim 0.4$, and a similar \nconclusion can be inferred from the contact interaction result. On the other \nhand, both curves disagree markedly with the data at infrared momenta. This is \nexplained by the similarity between these predictions and the bare result \ndetermined using the Sato-Lee (SL) dynamical meson-exchange \nmodel~\\cite{JuliaDiaz:2006xt}. The SL result supports a view that the \ndiscrepancy owes to omission of meson-cloud effects in the DSEs' computations. \nAn exploratory study of the effect of pion-cloud contributions to the mass of \nthe nucleon and the $\\Delta$-baryon has been performed within a DSEs' framework \nin Ref.~\\cite{Sanchis-Alepuz:2014wea}.\n\nPresentations of the experimental data associated with the magnetic transition \nform factor typically use the Ash convention. This comparison is depicted in \nthe upper-right panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:NucDel}. One can see that the difference \nbetween form factors obtained with the QCD-kindred and CI frameworks increases \nwith the transfer momentum. Moreover, the normalized QCD-kindred curve is in \nfair agreement with the data, indicating that the Ash form factor falls \nunexpectedly rapidly mainly for two reasons. First: meson-cloud effects provide \nup-to $35\\%$ of the form factor for $x \\lesssim 2$; these contributions are very \nsoft; and hence they disappear quickly. Second: the additional kinematic factor \n$\\sim 1/\\sqrt{Q^2}$ that appears between Ash and Jones-Scadron conventions and \nprovides material damping for $x\\gtrsim 2$.\n\nOur predictions for the ratios in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:REMSM}) are depicted in the \nlower panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:NucDel}. The left panel displays the Coulomb \nquadrupole ratio. Both the prediction obtained with QCD-like propagators and \nvertices and the contact-interaction result are broadly consistent with \navailable data. This shows that even a contact-interaction can produce \ncorrelations between dressed-quarks within Faddeev wave-functions and related\nfeatures in the current that are comparable in size with those observed \nempirically. Moreover, suppressing the dressed-quark anomalous magnetic moment \n(DqAMM) in the transition current has little impact. These remarks highlight \nthat $R_{SM}$ is not particularly sensitive to details of the Faddeev kernel \nand transition current.\n\nThis is certainly not the case with $R_{\\rm EM}$. The differences between the \ncurves displayed in the lower-right panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NucDel} show that \nthis ratio is a particularly sensitive measure of diquark and orbital angular \nmomentum correlations. The contact-interaction result is inconsistent with \ndata, possessing a zero that appears at a rather small value of $x$. On the \nother hand, predictions obtained with QCD-like propagators and vertices can be \nviable. We have presented four variants, which differ primarily in the location \nof the zero that is a feature of this ratio in all cases we have considered. \nThe inclusion of a DqAMM shifts the zero to a larger value of $x$. Given the \nuniformly small value of this ratio and its sensitivity to the DqAMM, we judge \nthat meson-cloud affects must play a large role on the entire domain that is \ncurrently accessible to experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[clip,height=0.18\\textheight,width=0.40\\textwidth]\n{figNR_NucWFU.eps}\n\\hspace*{1.00cm}\n\\includegraphics[clip,height=0.18\\textheight,width=0.40\\textwidth]\n{figNR_RopWFU.eps}\n\n\\caption{\\label{fig:NucRop_v1} \\emph{Left panel}.

It has also attracted much theoretical \nattention; but Ref.~\\cite{Segovia:2015hra} provides the first continuum \ntreatment of this problem using the power of relativistic quantum field theory. \nThat study begins with a computation of the mass and wave function of the \nproton and its first radial excitation. The masses are (in GeV): $M_{\\rm \nnucleon\\,(N)} = 1.18$ and $M_{\\rm nucleon-excited\\,(R)}=1.73$.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese values correspond to the locations of the two lowest-magnitude $J^P=1/2^+$ \npoles in the three-quark scattering problem. The associated residues are the \nFaddeev wave functions, which depend upon $(p^2,p\\cdot P)$, where $p$ is the \nquark-diquark relative momentum. Fig.~\\ref{fig:NucRop_v1} depicts the zeroth \nChebyshev moment of all $S$-wave components in that wave function. The \nappearance of a single zero in $S$-wave components of the Faddeev wave function \nassociated with the first excited state in the three dressed-quark scattering \nproblem indicates that this state is a radial excitation.\n\nThe empirical values of the pole locations for the first two states in the \nnucleon channel are~\\cite{Suzuki:2009nj}: $0.939\\,{\\rm GeV}$ and $1.36 - i \n\\, 0.091\\,{\\rm GeV}$, respectively. At first glance, these values appear \nunrelated to those obtained within the DSEs framework.\n\nHowever, deeper consideration reveals~\\cite{Eichmann:2008ae, Eichmann:2008ef} \nthat the kernel in the Faddeev equation omits all those resonant contributions \nwhich may be associated with the meson-baryon final-state interactions that are \nresummed in dynamical coupled channels models in order to transform a \nbare-baryon into the observed state~\\cite{Suzuki:2009nj, Kamano:2013iva}. This \nFaddeev equation should therefore be understood as producing the dressed-quark \ncore of the bound-state, not the completely-dressed and hence observable \nobject. Crucial, therefore, is a comparison between the quark-core mass and the \nvalue determined for the mass of the meson-undressed bare-Roper in \nRef.~\\cite{Suzuki:2009nj} which is $1.76\\,{\\rm GeV}$.\n\nThe transition form factors are displayed in Fig.~\\ref{fig:NucRop_v2}. The \nresults obtained using QCD-derived propagators and vertices agree with the data \non $x\\gtrsim 2$. The contact-interaction result simply disagree both \nquantitatively and qualitatively with the data. Therefore, experiment is \nevidently a sensitive tool with which to chart the nature of the quark-quark \ninteraction and hence discriminate between competing theoretical hypotheses.\n\nThe mismatch between the DSE predictions and data on $x\\lesssim 2$ is due to \nMeson-cloud contributions that are expected to be important on this domain. An \ninferred form of that contribution is provided by the dotted (green) curves in \nFig.~\\ref{fig:NucRop_v2}. These curves have fallen to just 20\\% of their \nmaximum value by $x=2$ and vanish rapidly thereafter so that the DSE \npredictions alone remain as the explanation of the data. Importantly, the \nexistence of a zero in $F_{2}^{\\ast}$ is not influenced by meson-cloud effects, \nalthough its precise location is.\n\n\n\n\\vspace*{-0.50cm}\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclusions}\n\\vspace*{-0.20cm}\n\nWe described a unified study of Nucleon, Delta and Roper elastic and transition \nform factors that compares predictions made by a QCD-kindred framework with \nresults obtained using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a \nvector$\\,\\otimes\\,$vector contact-interaction. The comparison emphasises \nthat experiment is sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running \ncoupling and masses in QCD. Amongst our results, the following are of \nparticular interest:\n\nthe presence of strong diquark correlations within the nucleon is sufficient to \nunderstand empirical extractions of the flavour-separated form factors.\n\nIn connection with the $\\gamma^{\\ast}N\\to \\Delta$ transition, the \nmomentum-dependence of the magnetic transition form factor, $G_M^\\ast$, matches \nthat of $G_M^n$ once the momentum transfer is high enough to pierce the \nmeson-cloud; and the electric quadrupole ratio is a keen measure of diquark and \norbital angular momentum correlations, the zero in which is obscured by \nmeson-cloud effects on the domain currently accessible to experiment.\n\nFinally, the Roper resonance is at heart of the nucleon's first radial \nexcitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a meson cloud that \nreduces its mass by approximately $20\\%$. Our analysis shows that a meson-cloud \nobscures the dressed-quark core from long-wavelength probes, but that it is \nrevealed to probes with $Q^2 \\gtrsim 3 m_N^2$.\n\n\n\n\\vspace*{-0.30cm}\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nThe material described in this contribution is drawn from work completed in \ncollaboration with numerous excellent people, to all of whom I am greatly \nindebted.\n\nI would also like to thank V.

Primary amongst them is a \nneed to chart the behaviour of QCD's running coupling and masses into the \ndomain of infrared momenta. Contemporary theory is incapable of solving this \nproblem alone but a collaboration with experiment holds a promise for progress. \nThis effort can benefit substantially by exposing the structure of nucleon \nexcited states and measuring the associated transition form factors at large \nmomentum transfers~\\cite{Aznauryan:2012ba}. Large momenta are needed in order \nto pierce the meson-cloud that, often to a significant extent, screens the \ndressed-quark core of all baryons~\\cite{Roberts:2011rr, Kamano:2013iva}; and it \nis via the $Q^2$ evolution of form factors that one gains access to the running \nof QCD's coupling and masses from the infrared into the \nultraviolet~\\cite{Cloet:2013gva,Chang:2013nia}.\n\nA unified QCD-based description of elastic and transition form factors \ninvolving the nucleon and its resonances has acquired additional significance \nowing to substantial progress in the extraction of transition electrocouplings, \n$g_{{\\rm v}NN^\\ast}$, from meson electroproduction data, obtained primarily \nwith the CLAS detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility \n(JLab). The electrocouplings of all low-lying $N^\\ast$ states with mass \nless-than $1.6\\,{\\rm GeV}$ have been determined via independent analyses of \n$\\pi^+ n$, $\\pi^0p$ and $\\pi^+ \\pi^- p$ exclusive \nchannels~\\cite{Agashe:2014kda,Mokeev:2012vsa}; and preliminary results for the \n$g_{{\\rm v}NN^\\ast}$ electrocouplings of most high-lying $N^\\ast$ states with \nmasses below $1.8\\,{\\rm GeV}$ have also been obtained from CLAS meson \nelectroproduction data~\\cite{Aznauryan:2012ba,Mokeev:2013kka}.\n\nMany new insights have been revealed in a series of recent \narticles~\\cite{Segovia:2013rca, Segovia:2013uga, Segovia:2014aza, \nSegovia:2015ufa, Segovia:2015hra} focused on the calculation of the Nucleon, \nDelta and Roper elastic and transition form factors using a widely-used \nleading-order (rainbow-ladder) truncation of QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations and \ncomparing results between a QCD-based framework and a vector$\\,\\otimes\\,$vector \ncontact interaction. It is our purpose here reviewing some of the most important \noutcomes and refer to the interested reader to the original works for details.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\hspace*{0.50cm}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.40\\textwidth,height=0.18\\textheight]\n{figNN_Faddeev.eps} \n\\hspace*{1.00cm}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.40\\textwidth,height=0.20\\textheight]\n{figNN_Nucleon.eps}\n\n\\caption{\\label{fig:Faddeev} {\\it Left panel:} Poincar\\'e covariant \nFaddeev equation. $\\Psi$ is the Faddeev amplitude for a baryon of total \nmomentum $P= p_q + p_d$, where $p_{q,d}$ are, respectively, the momenta of the \nquark and diquark within the bound-state.

This exchange ensures that diquark \ncorrelations within the baryon are fully dynamical: no quark holds a special \nplace because each one participates in all diquarks to the fullest extent \nallowed by its quantum numbers. Attending to the quantum numbers of the nucleon \nand Roper, scalar and pseudovector diquark correlations are dominant whereas \nonly pseudovector ones are present inside the $\\Delta$-baryon.\n\nThe quark$+$diquark structure of the nucleon is elucidated in the right panel \nof Fig.~\\ref{fig:Faddeev}, which depicts the leading component of its Faddeev \namplitude: with the notation of Ref.~\\cite{Segovia:2014aza}, \n$S_1(|p|,\\cos\\theta)$, computed using the Faddeev kernel described therein. \nThis function describes a piece of the quark$+$scalar-diquark relative momentum \ncorrelation. Notably, in this solution of a realistic Faddeev equation there is \nstrong variation with respect to both arguments. Support is concentrated in \nthe forward direction, $\\cos\\theta >0$, so that alignment of $p$ and $P$ is \nfavoured; and the amplitude peaks at $(|p|\\simeq M_N/6,\\cos\\theta=1)$, whereat \n$p_q \\sim p_d \\sim P/2$ and hence the natural relative momentum is zero. In the \nantiparallel direction, $\\cos\\theta<0$, support is concentrated at $|p|=0$, \ni.e. $p_q \\sim P/3$, $p_d \\sim 2P/3$.\n\nThe strong diquark correlations must be evident in many physical observables. \nWe focus our attention on the flavour separated versions of the Dirac a Pauli \nform factors of the nucleon. Figure~\\ref{fig:F1F2fla1} displays the proton's \nflavour separated Dirac and Pauli form factors. The salient features of the \ndata are: the $d$-quark contribution to $F_1^p$ is far smaller than the \n$u$-quark contribution; $F_2^d/\\kappa_d>F_2^u/\\kappa_u$ on $x<2$ but this \nordering is reversed on $x>2$; and in both cases the $d$-quark contribution \nfalls dramatically on $x>3$ whereas the $u$-quark contribution remains roughly \nconstant. Our calculations are in semi-quantitative agreement with the \nempirical data.\n\nIt is natural to seek an explanation for the pattern of behaviour in \nFig.~\\ref{fig:F1F2fla1}. We have mentioned that the proton contains scalar and \npseudovector diquark correlations. The dominant piece of its Faddeev wave \nfunction is $u[ud]$; namely, a $u$-quark in tandem with a $[ud]$ scalar \ncorrelation, which produces $62\\%$ of the proton's normalisation. If this were \nthe sole component, then photon--$d$-quark interactions within the proton would \nreceive a $1/x$ suppression on $x>1$, because the $d$-quark is sequestered in a \nsoft correlation, whereas a spectator $u$-quark is always available to \nparticipate in a hard interaction. At large $x=Q^2/M_N^2$, therefore, scalar \ndiquark dominance leads one to expect $F^d \\sim F^u/x$.  Available data are \nconsistent with this prediction but measurements at $x>4$ are necessary for \nconfirmation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.40\\textwidth]{figNN_F1.eps}\n\\hspace*{1.00cm}\n\\includegraphics[clip,width=0.40\\textwidth]{figNN_F2.eps}}\n\n\\caption{\\label{fig:F1F2fla1} {\\it Left panel:} Flavour separation of the \nproton's Dirac form factor as a function of $x=Q^2/M_N^2$.
