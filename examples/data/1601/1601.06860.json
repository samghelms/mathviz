The first factor in\neach term describes the dependence of the interaction energy on the\ndistance between the centers of mass of the two laths under\nconsideration, and the three other factors describe the dependence on\ntheir relative orientations. The explicit expressions are as follows\n\\begin{eqnarray} \\nonumber V_d(r_{kj}) &=& \n\\frac{1}{2}\n\\left(\\frac{\\tanh \\left(a\\left(r_{kj} -\\frac{\\sigma}{2} \\right)\\right)}{\\tanh \\left(\\frac{a \\sigma}{2} \\right)} -1 + \\frac{A_{excl}}{(r-r_{excl})^4}\\right)\\\\ \n\\nonumber\n     V_{o}({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}},{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_j}}) &=& ({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}} \\cdot\n     {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_j}})^{2}\\\\ \\nonumber V_{cn}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_{k}, {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}}}_{kj})\n     &=& \\begin{cases} ({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_{k} \\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}}}_{kj})^{2} & \\mbox{\n         if } {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_{k} \\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}}}_{kj} > 0 \\\\ 0 &\\mbox{ else\n     } \\end{cases}.  \\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe second factor, $V_{o}({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}},{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_j}})$, favors a parallel orientation\nfor the long axis of the two laths. The last two factors, $V_{cn}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k \\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj})$ and $V_{cn}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j \\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj})$,\nminimize the energy when the two vectors ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j$ are\nboth parallel to the connector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}$, thereby favoring the\ntwo faces of the laths to be parallel. The reason for distinguishing\nbetween positive and negative values of ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j \\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}$\nwill be explained below. Expression $V_d(r_{kj})$ is plotted in\nFig.\\ref{Vdist.pdf}. The minimum is seen to be at a distance\nbetween two laths of about $0.4*L_{lath}$. This implies that the\nthickness of the lath plus the face-to-face distance is about equal to\nthis value. In the simulations, the potential is linearized\nbelow a $0.3*L_{lath}$ to allow for acceptable time steps. The values\nof the various parameters in $V_d(r_{kj})$ are given in\n{[\\ref{{table:parameters}}]}.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Vdist.pdf} \n\\caption{\n  \\label{Vdist.pdf}\n  The dependence of the potential with the\n  distance,$V_d(r_{k,j})$, is a narrow function with its center close\n  to $0.4$ $L_{lath}$. Below a certain cutoff, $r_{cutoff}=0.3$  $L_{lath}$, it is replaced\n  with a linear extension. The threshold for sticking and\n  unsticking is close to the bottom of the well, that is $0.2\n  \\epsilon$ above the absolute bottom of the well, in the dash-dotted red\n  line.  (\\textit{Color online.}) }\n\\end{figure}\n\nWithin a whisker, a lath is strongly bound to one; or, more commonly,\nto two other laths. In order to complete the description of the\npotential energy, we must define when this binding within two laths\nhappens. This will be the case when their interaction energy is less\nthan a threshold energy $V_{thr}$ for which we choose $V_{thr}=-0.8\n\\epsilon$. Then, two laths which are strongly bound to each other,\nwhile none of the two laths is strongly bound to another lath,\ninteract like a pair of free laths.\n\n\n\\subsection{Propagator and refinement of potential} \n\nIn general there is no qualitative difference between the dynamics of\n${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$ and that of ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$, a simulation shall treat both with the\nsame methods and precision. Notice, however, that ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ is by\ndefinition perpendicular to ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$, so that ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$ has three degrees\nof freedom and ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ has one less. In the case of lath-like\nparticles, rotations around the long axes will be much faster than\nreorientations of ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$ or displacements of the laths as a whole; in\nother words, the dynamics of ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ will be much faster than that\nof ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$. We will therefore assume that during one time step the\nlath has fully explored all possible orientations around its long axis\nand has settled into the corresponding energetic minimum. This means\nthat during the simulation the vector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ will be determined by\nthe configuration described by $\\left\\{ {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_k, {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}} \\right\\}$ and\nits recent history (see below). We are then left with two equations of\nmotion for each particle: \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:equmotion}\n  d\\mathbf{r}_k\n    & = & - \\frac{1}{\\xi_0}\n             \\nabla_k \\Phi_C dt +  \\nabla_k \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{\\xi_0} \\right) dt\n      +   \\pmb{\\Theta}_k^t \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 k_B T dt}{\\xi_0} }.  \\\\\n d{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k & = & \n\\frac{L_{lath}^2}{9 \\xi_0} {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{T}}} \\times {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k dt + \\pmb \\Theta_k^r\\frac {L_{lath}}{3}\\sqrt{ \\frac{2 k_B T dt}{\\xi_0} }\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nHere $\\pmb{\\Theta}_k^t$ is a three dimensional random vector with\ncomponents which have zero mean and unit variance, uncorrelated among\neach other. Similarly $\\pmb{\\Theta}_k^r$ is a two dimensional\nrandom vector with uncorrelated components having zero mean and unit\nvariance. The two random rotations are applied around two\nperpendicular axes orthogonal to ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k$. After each time step the\nlength of the vector ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k$ is brought back to unity by a shortening\nalong the original orientation \\cite{COBB05,so55984}. $\\xi_0$ is the\naverage translational friction of the lath; we have chosen the\nrotational friction to be related to the translational friction as for\ninfinitely long rods \\cite{Doi,so55984}.\n\nLet us now describe how we update ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$. First, consider two\nlaths $k$ and $j$, neither of whom is interacting with any other\nlath. We choose ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k={\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}-({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}\\cdot\n{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k){\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k$, and similarly for ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j$, since these are the\norientations assumed to correspond to the minimum interaction between\nthe two laths for the given configuration $\\left\\{ {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj},\n{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k, {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_j \\right\\}$; unit vector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ is ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k /\n\\sqrt{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k\\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k}$. This choice will drive the two laths\nto become parallel and have their centers of mass connector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}$ perpendicular to both ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_j$. Substituting\nthese expressions for ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j$ into the potential\nabove leaves us with a simple pair potential as commonly used in\nsimulations of hard convex bodies.\n\nThe situation is different when a free lath $j$ interacts with a lath\n$k$, which is strongly interacting with another lath ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k) \\neq\nj$. In this case lath $j$ may still freely reorient along its long\naxis, but lath $k$ is restricted to do so by its strong interaction\nwith ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k) \\neq j$. We therefore choose ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j$ as above, but\nset ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ equal to the normalized ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k}} = {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} - ({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} \\cdot\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k) {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k$. The ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k)$ is strongly bound to lath $k$. We\nare now in the situation where we need to distinguish between two\ncases in the definition of $V_{cn}$. Only when lath $j$ is situated on\nthe positive side of lath $k$ it may bind to lath $k$; on the negative\nside lath $k$ is already bound to lath ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k)$ and cannot bind to\nthe newly arriving lath $j$ anymore. Notice that this treatment of the\nre-orientations of the laths around their long axes turns the\npotential in this case into a three body potential. Moreover the\npotential becomes history dependent. This is similar to coarse grain\nsimulations of linear polymers \\cite{0953-8984-23-23-233101}, where\nthe entangling of polymers is not fully determined by the\nconfiguration of the beads, but depends on how the beads came to that\nparticular configuration.\n\nA third situation occurs when two laths $k$ and $j$ approach each\nother, but are already bound to ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k) \\neq j$ and ${\\ensuremath{s}}(j) \\neq\nk$ respectively. In this case we have ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k}} = {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} - ({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} \\cdot\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k) {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k$ and similarly for ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_j}}$. Only when lath $j$ is on\nthe positive side of lath $k$, determined by lath ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k)$, and lath\n$k$ is on the positive side of lath $j$, determined by ${\\ensuremath{s}}(j)$,\nwill the interaction be non-zero. This treatment turns the interaction\ninto a four-body interaction. The description given above is summarized in Fig.\\ref{threebodypot.pdf}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm,bb=0 0 899 395]{threebodypot.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{threebodypot.pdf}\nSketch of the vectors used in the\n  three body potential.

With\nthis choice, the unit of time is $L_{Lath}^2/D_0$, the unit of\nvelocity is $D_0/L_{Lath}$, and the unit of pressure is\n$k_BT/L_{Lath}^3$. However, SI units are used in the description of\nthe results of this paper.\n\nAll model parameters used in this study are given in\n{[\\ref{{table:parameters}}]}, once in reduced units and once in SI\nunits. The latter are only used in a few occasions to show that with\nreasonable parameters the model gives results that are comparable to\nthose found experimentally. The SI parameter settings are meant to be\nreasonably close to those that apply to P3HT solutions.\n\nWe emphasize that the important characteristics of the model are that\nbonding can only occur in one-dimensional structures and that the\nbonding is very strong, $i.e.$ $\\epsilon=100k_BT_0$.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\\footnotesize \\caption{Parameters used in the model}\\label{table:parameters}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\resizebox{7cm}{!}{\n      \\begin{tabular}{| p{3.2cm}|  c|  p{3.2cm}| }\n        \\hline\n        Parameter& Symbol & Value \\\\ \\hline\\hline\n        Strength of the alignment potential.  & $\\epsilon$ & $4.04 \\times 10^{-19} J$ $=100 k_B \\times T_0$\\\\ \\hline\n        Length of the laths, unit of distance &$L_{lath}$ & $68.44$ $nm$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Length of the size of the squared shaped simulation box& $L_{box}$ &  $ 8\\times L_{lath} = 0.5452$ $\\mu m$\\\\ \\hline\n        Laths in the simulation box & $N_{laths,total}$ &   $512$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Inflection point of $V_d$ & $\\sigma/2$ &   $34.22$ $nm$\\\\ \\hline\n        Cutoff for the linear extension of $V_d$ &  $r_{cutoff}$  & $0.3  L_{lath}\\approx 20.53 nm$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Threshold for sticking/unsticking of laths. &  $V_{thr.}$ & $-0.8\\epsilon$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Slope (sharpness) of potential $V_d$ & $a$ & $ 20 m^{-1}$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Excluded volume distance constant &  $r_{excluded}$  & $0.22 L_{lath}\\approx 15.05 nm$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Excluded volume amplitude &  $A_{excluded}$  & $0.0001$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Power of the orientational potential  & $l$ & $1$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Time-step & $\\Delta_t$ & $1 \\times 10^{-5} s$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Initial Temperature & $T_0$ & $293$ $K$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Solvent friction (translational) & $\\xi_0$ & $8.66 \\times 10^{-7} kg / s$ \\\\\\hline \n        Solvent friction (rotational) & $\\xi_{0t} = \\frac{\\xi_0}{9}$ & $9.62 \\times 10^{-8} kg / s$ \\\\\\hline \n    \\end{tabular}}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\nResults from a typical run with these parameters and at temperature\n$T=40$ $K$ are shown in Fig.\\ref{495_T_40_three_plots.png}. In the\nleft panel a box is shown at the beginning of the run. All laths are\ncolored blue indicating that none of them is strongly bound to any of\nthe others. In the middle panel the same box is shown at time $t=\n50000 $, which corresponds to $0.5$ $seconds$ in SI units. It is\nclearly seen that several laths have collected into short chains, also\ncalled whiskers from now on. Laths which are connected through a\nsequence of consecutive strong bonds are given the same\ncolor. Different colors correspond to different whiskers. In the right\npanel, the same box is shown at $t= 20000000$, which corresponds to\n$200$ $seconds$ in SI units. The box has now reached equilibrium and\nseveral long whiskers are observed.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\nIn this section we describe the results of our simulations. First we\ndescribe the approach to equilibrium of simulations boxes which were\ninitially either fully disordered or fully ordered. This gives\ninformation about typical time scales in the system. We also briefly\nanalyze the structure of final equilibrium boxes. In a second\nsubsection we describe the rheological properties of our systems, with\nspecial attention being given to the gel transition.\n\n\\subsection{Time evolution of formation of whiskers and equilibrium distributions of lengths}\n\nAs we have seen in the previous section, the model parameters chosen\nin this study lead to the formation of whiskers during simulations\nstarting at time zero with completely disordered boxes. In this\nsection we analyze how this structure evolves with time. To fully\ncharacterize the structure of the whiskers we studied several\ncharacteristics: its length as a function of time,in number of laths\nper whisker; the number of whiskers formed in the simulation box, as a\nfunction of time; the total material in whiskers as function of time,\nand the histogram of distribution of whisker sizes.\n\nIn\n\\ref{848_847_846_845_844_843_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several.pdf}\nwe present, for various temperatures, the time evolution of the number\nof whiskers in our boxes. The left panel corresponds to those that\nstarted with randomly distributed laths, while the right hand side\npanel presents data for boxes starting from fully ordered boxes,\n\\textit{i.e.} boxes in which all laths were collected in one long\nwhisker. Only the first five seconds are shown.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm,bb=0 0 842 595]{FIG5.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{848_847_846_845_844_843_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several.pdf}\n  Number of whiskers as function of time, for 6 different\n  temperatures (in Kelvin); first $5$ $s$; average over 20 simulations.  \\textit{(Left)}\n  initially disordered configuration, the number of whiskers reaches a\n  higher plateau for higher temperatures. \\textit{(Right)} initially ordered\n  configuration. The only discernible difference between ordered and\n  disordered initial configurations after a few seconds is a lower\n  plateau for the high temperature average number of whiskers in the\n  case of initially ordered simulation.  (\\textit{Color online.})}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor temperatures substantially larger than $T_0$, large numbers of\nwhiskers (necessarily small) are observed after the first one tenth of a\nsecond. In boxes starting from disorder these are obtained by\naggregation of laths, while in boxes starting from the ordered\nstructure these are obtained by disintegration of the initially\navailable very long whisker. After the first one tenth of a second\nhardly any changes occur in the number of whiskers in these\nboxes. Notice that the various plateau values are not equal for\ncorresponding temperatures in the left and right hand side\npanels. This is due to the fact that with our code the identification\nof whiskers is history dependent, as already mentioned in the previous\nsection. This somewhat unrealistic aspect only affects the numbers of\nvery short whiskers.\n\nFor temperatures of the order of $T_0$ or less, in boxes starting from\ndisorder, again a large number of whiskers is formed within the first\nfew tenths of a second. From then on the number of whiskers start to\ngradually decrease with increasing time. This is due to the fact that\ninitially only very small whiskers are formed, which then start to\nmerge into longer whiskers. Eventually, equilibrium distributions of\nlengths occur, depending on the temperature. For these temperatures,\nboxes starting from ordered configurations behave slightly different\nthan those starting from disorder. Again, as in the high temperature\ncase, the long initial whiskers start to disintegrate, but this time\nincreasingly slower with decreasing temperatures. There are still\novershoots in the numbers of whiskers after which the distributions of\nwhiskers begin to rearrange in order to approach the appropriate\nequilibrium distributions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm,bb=0 0 439 583]{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several_long.pdf} \n\\caption{\n  \\label{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several_long.pdf}\nNumber\n  of whiskers as function of time, for different temperatures; average\n  over 20 simulations; initially ordered configuration. After the\n  initial sharp growth in number of whiskers there is a decay to a\n  plateau value that depends on the temperature.  (\\textit{Color online.})}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn\n\\ref{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several_long.pdf}\nwe again present the time evolution of the number of stickers for the\nsame temperatures as above, but this time for a much longer time span\nof $40$ $s$. Since there is no difference after the first five seconds\nbetween the simulations starting from disorder and those starting from\norder, except for the very high temperatures, we restrict the data\nhere to those of boxes starting from ordered structures. The main\nconclusion from theses runs is that it is safe to assume that\nequilibrium distributions have developed only after about twenty to\ntwenty five seconds, depending on temperature.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm,bb=0 0 842 595]{FIG7.pdf} \n\\caption\n        {\n\\label{FIG7.pdf}\nAverage number of laths per whisker, as function of temperature; first\n$5$ $s$; for 20 simulations.

(\\textit{Color online.})}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\ref{FIG7.pdf} shows the transient behavior, initial $4$\nseconds, of the average number of laths per whisker,\n$<N_{laths/whisker}>$, for both initially disordered and ordered\nconfigurations. Notice that the vertical axes are on log scales to\nmore easily span a broad range of values.  Both plots show the\nexpected behavior: a steady increase of the number of laths per\nwhisker, for the initially disordered configurations; a breaking up of\nthe initially available whisker spanning the whole box, followed by a\nsteady increase of the number of laths per whisker for the initially\nordered simulations. Again, the lower the temperature, the slower is\nthe time evolution of the towards the final plateau\nvalues. \\ref{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanRODSinWHISKER_b.pdf}\nshows the long time behavior, up to $40$ $s$, for the initially\nordered simulations. As before we notice that up to twenty five\nseconds are needed before the systems reach equilibrium. Notice also\nthat the high temperature systems reach only average values of two\nlaths per whisker, the minimum value to form a whisker; as the\ntemperature decreases the plateau values grow to values of about ten\nfor the lowest temperature.\n\nIt is interesting to have a look at the time evolution of the total\nnumber of laths taking part in whiskers. These results are shown in\n\\ref{FIG10.pdf}. Again, in the left panel results refer to\nsystems starting from disorder, while the right panel refers to\nsystems starting from order. It is seen that in systems starting from\ndisorder the total material in whiskers is monotonically increasing,\nwhile with systems starting from ordered boxes the total material in\nwhiskers is almost constant; an initial large whisker may split into\nsome whiskers, but does not result into individual laths. It is\ninteresting to notice that after five seconds all simulations have\nreached their steady state values. This means that after this time the\nonly thing that happens is a rearrangement of the laths in the\nwhiskers in order to approach the appropriate equilibrium\ndistributions. This process takes about twenty seconds.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf}\nHistogram of laths per whisker; for $10$ different seeds of the random\nnumber generator; previously equilibrated by $40$ $s$, and continued\nby $40$ $s$; at a temperature of $80$ $K$; each simulation having\n$512$ laths.

The total number of sampled whiskers for this plot is $23835$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNext, we are interested in the length-distributions of the whiskers in\nequilibrium. In \\ref{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf} we present the\ndistribution of lengths in boxes with temperature $T=80$ $K$. The plot\nis based on the results of $10$ simulations, starting with different\nseeds for the random number generators and equilibrated for $40$ $s$,\nafter which production runs of $40$ $s$ each were started. As is clear\nfrom the plot, the lengths of whiskers are exponentially distributed,\nwith a mean value of $8.28$ laths per whisker. This results in a slope\nin \\ref{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf} of $\\lambda = 1/8.28 \\approx\n0.121$. The exponential distribution allows for only very few long\nwhiskers; in the present case the longest whiskers found have lengths\nof about $90$ laths. Nevertheless, such long whiskers quickly deplete\nthe pool of laths, which leads to severe finite size effects for\ntemperatures of about $80$ $K$ or less. This is clearly seen in\n\\ref{836__LOGlathsINwhiskerAFO_invTEMP.pdf} and \\ref{836__RodsINwhiskerAFO_TEMP.pdf} where we have plotted the average lengths of\nwhiskers as a function of inverse temperature. The distribution\nroughly behaves as described in the paper by Cates and Candau on\nworm-like micelles \\cite{0953-8984-2-33-001}. In this case the expressions relating the average number of laths per whisker and the temperature are:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nonumber  \\ln\\left(N_{laths/whisker} -2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\phi +\\frac{\\epsilon}{2k_BT} \\ \\ \\mbox{ for low temperatures }\\\\\n  \\ln\\left(N_{laths/whisker} -2\\right) =  \\ln \\phi +\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_BT} \\ \\ \\mbox{ for high temperatures }\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nOur system recovers, quantitatively, the expected trend for low\ntemperatures.  The discrepancy with the theory may come from the fact\nthat the boxes have very low number of laths in the simulation box\ncompared to the real system; with only 512 of them, so there may be\nsize effects. This effect is also amplified if we take into the fact\nthat appearance of large whiskers is a rare event.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering \\includegraphics[width=14cm,bb=0 0 842 595]{FIG10.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{FIG10.pdf} \nTotal material in whiskers (as the product of the average number of\nwhiskers and the average laths per whisker), for different\ntemperatures (in Kelvin); as a function of time and for the first $5$\n$s$ of the evolution. \\textit{(Left)} Initially disordered\nconfiguration. \\textit{(Right)} Initially ordered configuration.

In\nparticular we will investigate how the shear relaxation modulus varies\nwith temperature, and how these variations are related to changes of\nthe distribution of whiskers.\n\n\nIn \\ref{862_GofTIMEseveral.pdf} we present the shear relaxation\nmodulus $G(t)$ as a function of time for various temperatures. Since\nwe are not aiming to study rheological properties like the shear\nstorage and loss moduli, $G'$ and $G\"$ respectively, in great detail,\nwe did not push calculations of the shear relaxation modulus to\nconvergence for times larger than a few seconds. It is clear from\nFig.\\ref{862_GofTIMEseveral.pdf} that the plateau value at early times\nquickly increases with decreasing temperature.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{835_GofTEMPseveral.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{835_GofTEMPseveral.pdf}\nPlateau value for $G$, as\n  function of $T$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{835_GofN_avseveral.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{835_GofN_avseveral.pdf}\nPlateau value for $G$, as\n  function of the number length.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn \\ref{835_GofTEMPseveral.pdf} we present these plateau values\nas a function of temperature. As is clear from this plot, the zero\nshear plateau values smoothly increase with decreasing time, up to\ntemperatures of about 200 K. At lower temperatures they fluctuate\naround an average value of about $170$ kPa. This is probably due to\nfinite size effects as the exponential length distribution becomes\nseverely perturbed since the box can not accommodate sufficiently long\nwhiskers. This has already been noticed above when discussing the\naverage whisker length as function of temperature.\n\nIn \\ref{835_GofN_avseveral.pdf} we plot the same data, but now\nagainst the average number of laths per whisker. For small values of\n$<N_{laths/whisker}>$, $G_{t\\rightarrow 0}$ smoothly increases with\nincreasing $<N_{laths/whisker}>$. For large values of the latter, the\nzero shear plateau fluctuates around a constant value. \n\n\nNext we recall that the experimental determination of the gel\ntransition is usually based on values of $G'$ and $G''$ at a frequency\nof one Hertz. If we now return to the shear relaxation modulus as a\nfunction of time (see \\ref{862_GofTIMEseveral.pdf}), we notice\nthat at times less than about one second high temperature $G(t)'s$\nhave decayed to very small values, while low temperature $G(t)'s$ have\nnot decayed at all. At intermediate temperatures the shear relaxation\nmodulus for $t=1 s$ sharply rises. Therefore, in\n\\ref{compare_791_with_812_fitGpGppAFOT.pdf} we plot the\nstorage and loss moduli at one Hertz as a function of temperature.  It\nis clear from this plot that for temperatures below about $400 K$ the\nsystem behaves basically elastic, while for temperatures above $400 K$\nthe system is predominantly viscous. We therefore conclude that\naccording to the usual rheological definition a gel transition occurs\nat about $400 K$. A similar behavior has been reported in rheological experiments of gelation of P3HT \\cite{doi:10.1021/ma202564k}.\n\nFrom the above results we come to the conclusion that the gel\ntransition in whisker forming systems is not a real transition, but\ndepends very much the definition being used. Moreover, being used to\ndifferent strengths of everyday forces and times will define the gel\ntransition using a different frequency, and arrive at much lower gel\ntransition temperatures.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{compare_791_with_812_fitGpGppAFOT.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{compare_791_with_812_fitGpGppAFOT.pdf}\nOscillatory\n  shear numerical experiment.

It is inspired in\nthe $\\pi - \\pi$ stacking interaction between polythiophenes.  In the\ncrystallized state the planes defined by the backbone of this\nmolecules lie parallel to each other forming long threads (up to the\n$\\mu m$ scale), called \\emph{whiskers} in the literature.  (For\nexample, a P3HT molecule of of contour length of 65 nm, produces\nwhiskers of $15 \\sim 20$ nm width, 5nm thick -two or three chain\nlayers-, and $10 \\mu m$ long \\cite{Lim201014}).\n\nWe propose to model the molecule as a long slender plane, i.e., with a\nhigh aspect ratio between the two in-plane directions; which we call a\n\\emph{lath}. A lath is defined to remain \\emph{free} if the energy of\ninteraction with all its neighbors is above some minimum threshold\n(small in absolute value or positive). On the contrary a lath within a\nwhisker is \\emph{stuck} to its two closest neighbors and does not\ninteract with the others.\n\nThe potential energy depends on a single energetic parameter, and also\non the history of the system; having slightly different expressions\nfor two, three and four body interactions. This allows for a very fast\nalgorithm, that can be used to study the rheology of the system.\n\nGiven our choice of the parameters, we obtain a whisker formation\nprocess that reaches an equilibrium state in matter of twenty to\ntwenty five seconds, depending on the temperature. The distribution\nof number of laths per whisker, which depends on the temperature, has\nan exponential shape. For $T=80$ $K$, this gives a mean of $8.28$ laths\nper whisker; similar to the case of worm-like micelles.\n\nOur system, while being very simple, does reproduce the gel transition\nthat happens in the case of P3HT in solution. An oscillatory shear\nexperiment that measures $G'$ and $G''$ while slowly decreasing the\ntemperature $8$ $K$ each $1$ $s$, gives rise to a transition from\nliquid to gel. As the transition is the product of the formation of\nthe whiskers, we conclude that part of the rheological changes can be\naccounted only to the fact of the whisker formation. \n\nIt has been reported in the literature an hysteresis between the\nramping up and down of the gelation process\n\\cite{doi:10.1021/ma202564k}. Our system does not show this\nbehavior. A possible reason is the absence of branching in our\nsystem. Not having this possibility makes the system pseudo-one\ndimensional; and since there are no phase transitions for one\ndimensional structures, while for higher dimensional there are both\npercolation and phase transitions, it is expected that branching would\nprovide such transitions.\n\nFurther improvements to the present model include the study of the\ninteraction between sphere-like particles, like the PCBM or C60, with\nthe laths. It could also be important to study the effect on the\nalignment that can be obtained by including a second kind of lath,\nthat not necessarily shares the aromatic interaction; as for instance\n gold nanorods \\cite{doi:10.1021/ma402179w}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have investigated the gel transition in $\\pi$-stacking long laths,\nbeing prototype for moderately long stiff aromatic polymers. The\n$\\pi$-stacking bonds allow for the creation of long whiskers of\nconsecutively stacked laths.  We did not allow for branching of such\nwhiskers, thereby preventing the occurrence of extended\nthree-dimensional networks.  In particular, the pseudo one-dimensional\ncharacter of the whiskers does not allow for structural transitions\nwith varying temperatures that could depend on the direction of the\ntemperature gradient; in other words, hysteresis is not present in the\ngel-sol transition. This character also forces their length\ndistribution to be exponential.  As a result, only very few long\nwhiskers occur amidst a see of many smaller whiskers.  Chances of\nhaving mechanically percolating structures are therefore very low.\nNevertheless, we have found that with the usual definition of gel\ntransition, occurring at a temperature where the ratio of the storage\nand loss moduli at a frequency of one Hertz changes from values larger\nthan one to values lower than one, such a transition indeed does\noccur. Our main conclusion therefore is that the occurrence of a gel\ntransition does not necessarily imply that percolating three\ndimensional structures have developed in the system.\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\n\nSome of the simulations for this paper used computational time from\nthe ``Centro de Informatica y Biolog\\'\\i a Computacional BIOS'', and\nran through the ``Red Nacional Acad\\'emica de Tecnolog\\'\\i a Avanzada,\nRENATA''.

The system under consideration consists of long slender laths who interact mostly in the direction perpendicular to their areas; self-assembling into ordered aggregates. An example of such system, which inspired this project, is the poly 3 hexylthiophene (P3HT); a polymer used in the construction of solar cells. In this context, the ordered aggregates are known as whiskers. In order to do the numerical oscillatory shear experiments, we have developed a Brownian dynamics model, in which the potential depends on the orientation of the particles, Brownian Orientational Lath moDel (BOLd).  It is characterized by a potential energy that depends both on the angle between orientation vectors, along the long axis of the laths, as well as the vectors normal to the plane of the laths; and which has only one energetic parameter. The storage and loss modulus measured here shown the gel transition, even though there are no mechanically percolating structures. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\date{\\today}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe strong forces between molecules (or macromolecules) who have a\n$\\pi$ structure is known in the literature as \\emph{aromatic}, or\nsimply $\\pi-\\pi$ interaction \\cite{doi:10.1021/ja00170a016}. In the\ncase of some of semi-flexible polymers, it is known to cause stacking\nof the aromatic groups; which in turn drives a self-assembly process\nthat creates structures orders of magnitude larger than the length of\nthe original particles\\cite{Lim201014,POLB:POLB22310}.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=7cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{modelMolecule.pdf}\n  \\caption{\n    \\label{modelMolecule.pdf} \n    Model of the molecule.

One particularly clever experimental\nset-up consists in probing this network by comparing measurements of\nthe electrical conductivity and the rheology of such gels\n\\cite{doi:10.1021/ma202564k,doi:10.1021/ma2000515}.\n\nPrevious computational studies (Langevin coarse grained and MD\nsimulations) have studied both the self-assembly process of the P3HT\nmolecules into whiskers,\n\\cite{C3NR33324H,lee2012ellipsoid,doi:10.1021/jp907338j}; as well as\nthe gel formation \\cite{doi:10.1021/ma302343e}. Although successful,\nthese models have the drawback of relying in complex force fields; \nwhich are both computationally expensive and difficult to interpret\nby isolating the individual interactions.\n\nIn the present letter we propose a new coarse grained model that aims\nto capture the basic aspects of the phenomenon, using just one\nenergetic parameter. To do so we coarse grain the whole molecule into\na lath, a slender plane, profiting from the plane geometry of the\nsemi-flexible polymer. Two kind of interactions model the forces \nbetween laths: a potential that depends on the relative orientation and\ndistance to other laths, and represents the $\\pi-\\pi$ interaction; and\nan excluded volume contribution. In combination with a Brownian\ndynamics method, this allows to produce a fast and simple model which\ngenerates and allows to study the aggregation of the laths into\nwhiskers.\n\n\n\\section{Model and simulations}\n\\subsection{Configurations and interactions}\nAs already emphasized above, our goal is to investigate the gel\ntransition of strongly interacting lath-like objects of colloidal\nsizes. Although the basic system to which we apply our model will be\nthat of $\\pi$-stacking polythiophenes in solution, we will keep the model\nitself as generic as possible. We therefore consider as basic object\nof our simulations a lath as depicted in\nFig.\\ref{modelMolecule.pdf}. We describe its position the three\nCartesian coordinates ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}=\\left\\{x, y, z\\right\\}$ of its center\nof mass, and its orientation in space by and the two perpendicular\nunit vectors ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}$. Subscripts will indicate the\nparticular lath under consideration. The vector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}$ specifies the\ndirection of the long axis of the lath while ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}$ is chosen to be\nperpendicular to the plane spanned by the two longest edges of the\nlath. In all that follows it is assumed that the shortest of the three\nedges is much shorter than the others, as is the case in P3HT.\n\nWe propose to describe the potential of a given configuration as  \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:totalALIGpot} \\Phi_{S} = \\epsilon\n\\sum_{j,k} V_{d}(r_{kj})V_{o}({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}},{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_j}}) V_{cn}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k \\cdot\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj})V_{cn}({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j \\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}), \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Phi_{S}=\\epsilon\\sum_{j,k}V_{d}(r_{kj})V_{o}({{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}_{k}},{{%&#10;\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}_{j}})V_{cn}({\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}_{k}\\cdot{\\mathbf{r}}_{kj})V%&#10;_{cn}({\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}_{j}\\cdot{\\mathbf{r}}_{kj}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>S</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>\u03f5</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></munder><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>d</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>o</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\ud835\udc2e</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>k</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\ud835\udc2e</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>k</mi></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc2b</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\ud835\udc27</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>j</mi></msub><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc2b</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06860.tex", "nexttext": " \n\\noindent or \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": " \n\n\\noindent where ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}={\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_k - {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_j$, is connector\nbetween two laths, and $r_{kj}$ is its length.

Expression $V_d(r_{kj})$ is plotted in\nFig.\\ref{Vdist.pdf}. The minimum is seen to be at a distance\nbetween two laths of about $0.4*L_{lath}$. This implies that the\nthickness of the lath plus the face-to-face distance is about equal to\nthis value. In the simulations, the potential is linearized\nbelow a $0.3*L_{lath}$ to allow for acceptable time steps.

Then, two laths which are strongly bound to each other,\nwhile none of the two laths is strongly bound to another lath,\ninteract like a pair of free laths.\n\n\n\\subsection{Propagator and refinement of potential} \n\nIn general there is no qualitative difference between the dynamics of\n${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$ and that of ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$, a simulation shall treat both with the\nsame methods and precision.

In the case of lath-like\nparticles, rotations around the long axes will be much faster than\nreorientations of ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$ or displacements of the laths as a whole; in\nother words, the dynamics of ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ will be much faster than that\nof ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}}$. We will therefore assume that during one time step the\nlath has fully explored all possible orientations around its long axis\nand has settled into the corresponding energetic minimum. This means\nthat during the simulation the vector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ will be determined by\nthe configuration described by $\\left\\{ {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_k, {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}_k}} \\right\\}$ and\nits recent history (see below). We are then left with two equations of\nmotion for each particle: \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:equmotion}\n  d\\mathbf{r}_k\n    & = & - \\frac{1}{\\xi_0}\n             \\nabla_k \\Phi_C dt +  \\nabla_k \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{\\xi_0} \\right) dt\n      +   \\pmb{\\Theta}_k^t \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 k_B T dt}{\\xi_0} }.  \\\\\n d{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k & = & \n\\frac{L_{lath}^2}{9 \\xi_0} {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{T}}} \\times {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k dt + \\pmb \\Theta_k^r\\frac {L_{lath}}{3}\\sqrt{ \\frac{2 k_B T dt}{\\xi_0} }\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nHere $\\pmb{\\Theta}_k^t$ is a three dimensional random vector with\ncomponents which have zero mean and unit variance, uncorrelated among\neach other. Similarly $\\pmb{\\Theta}_k^r$ is a two dimensional\nrandom vector with uncorrelated components having zero mean and unit\nvariance. The two random rotations are applied around two\nperpendicular axes orthogonal to ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k$. After each time step the\nlength of the vector ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k$ is brought back to unity by a shortening\nalong the original orientation \\cite{COBB05,so55984}. $\\xi_0$ is the\naverage translational friction of the lath; we have chosen the\nrotational friction to be related to the translational friction as for\ninfinitely long rods \\cite{Doi,so55984}.\n\nLet us now describe how we update ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$. First, consider two\nlaths $k$ and $j$, neither of whom is interacting with any other\nlath. We choose ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k={\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}-({\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}\\cdot\n{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k){\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k$, and similarly for ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j$, since these are the\norientations assumed to correspond to the minimum interaction between\nthe two laths for the given configuration $\\left\\{ {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj},\n{\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_k, {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{{u}}}}}}}_j \\right\\}$; unit vector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ is ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k /\n\\sqrt{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k\\cdot {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k}$. This choice will drive the two laths\nto become parallel and have their centers of mass connector ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{kj}$ perpendicular to both ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_j$. Substituting\nthese expressions for ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j$ into the potential\nabove leaves us with a simple pair potential as commonly used in\nsimulations of hard convex bodies.\n\nThe situation is different when a free lath $j$ interacts with a lath\n$k$, which is strongly interacting with another lath ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k) \\neq\nj$. In this case lath $j$ may still freely reorient along its long\naxis, but lath $k$ is restricted to do so by its strong interaction\nwith ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k) \\neq j$. We therefore choose ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_j$ as above, but\nset ${\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}}}_k$ equal to the normalized ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k}} = {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} - ({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} \\cdot\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k) {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k$. The ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k)$ is strongly bound to lath $k$. We\nare now in the situation where we need to distinguish between two\ncases in the definition of $V_{cn}$. Only when lath $j$ is situated on\nthe positive side of lath $k$ it may bind to lath $k$; on the negative\nside lath $k$ is already bound to lath ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k)$ and cannot bind to\nthe newly arriving lath $j$ anymore. Notice that this treatment of the\nre-orientations of the laths around their long axes turns the\npotential in this case into a three body potential. Moreover the\npotential becomes history dependent. This is similar to coarse grain\nsimulations of linear polymers \\cite{0953-8984-23-23-233101}, where\nthe entangling of polymers is not fully determined by the\nconfiguration of the beads, but depends on how the beads came to that\nparticular configuration.\n\nA third situation occurs when two laths $k$ and $j$ approach each\nother, but are already bound to ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k) \\neq j$ and ${\\ensuremath{s}}(j) \\neq\nk$ respectively. In this case we have ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_k}} = {\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} - ({\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_{{\\ensuremath{s}}(k),k}}} \\cdot\n{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k) {\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{\\hat{u}}}}_k$ and similarly for ${\\ensuremath{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{n}}}_j}}$. Only when lath $j$ is on\nthe positive side of lath $k$, determined by lath ${\\ensuremath{s}}(k)$, and lath\n$k$ is on the positive side of lath $j$, determined by ${\\ensuremath{s}}(j)$,\nwill the interaction be non-zero. This treatment turns the interaction\ninto a four-body interaction. The description given above is summarized in Fig.\\ref{threebodypot.pdf}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm,bb=0 0 899 395]{threebodypot.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{threebodypot.pdf}\nSketch of the vectors used in the\n  three body potential.

With\nthis choice, the unit of time is $L_{Lath}^2/D_0$, the unit of\nvelocity is $D_0/L_{Lath}$, and the unit of pressure is\n$k_BT/L_{Lath}^3$. However, SI units are used in the description of\nthe results of this paper.\n\nAll model parameters used in this study are given in\n{[\\ref{{table:parameters}}]}, once in reduced units and once in SI\nunits. The latter are only used in a few occasions to show that with\nreasonable parameters the model gives results that are comparable to\nthose found experimentally. The SI parameter settings are meant to be\nreasonably close to those that apply to P3HT solutions.\n\nWe emphasize that the important characteristics of the model are that\nbonding can only occur in one-dimensional structures and that the\nbonding is very strong, $i.e.$ $\\epsilon=100k_BT_0$.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\\footnotesize \\caption{Parameters used in the model}\\label{table:parameters}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\resizebox{7cm}{!}{\n      \\begin{tabular}{| p{3.2cm}|  c|  p{3.2cm}| }\n        \\hline\n        Parameter& Symbol & Value \\\\ \\hline\\hline\n        Strength of the alignment potential.  & $\\epsilon$ & $4.04 \\times 10^{-19} J$ $=100 k_B \\times T_0$\\\\ \\hline\n        Length of the laths, unit of distance &$L_{lath}$ & $68.44$ $nm$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Length of the size of the squared shaped simulation box& $L_{box}$ &  $ 8\\times L_{lath} = 0.5452$ $\\mu m$\\\\ \\hline\n        Laths in the simulation box & $N_{laths,total}$ &   $512$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Inflection point of $V_d$ & $\\sigma/2$ &   $34.22$ $nm$\\\\ \\hline\n        Cutoff for the linear extension of $V_d$ &  $r_{cutoff}$  & $0.3  L_{lath}\\approx 20.53 nm$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Threshold for sticking/unsticking of laths. &  $V_{thr.}$ & $-0.8\\epsilon$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Slope (sharpness) of potential $V_d$ & $a$ & $ 20 m^{-1}$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Excluded volume distance constant &  $r_{excluded}$  & $0.22 L_{lath}\\approx 15.05 nm$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Excluded volume amplitude &  $A_{excluded}$  & $0.0001$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Power of the orientational potential  & $l$ & $1$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Time-step & $\\Delta_t$ & $1 \\times 10^{-5} s$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Initial Temperature & $T_0$ & $293$ $K$ \\\\ \\hline\n        Solvent friction (translational) & $\\xi_0$ & $8.66 \\times 10^{-7} kg / s$ \\\\\\hline \n        Solvent friction (rotational) & $\\xi_{0t} = \\frac{\\xi_0}{9}$ & $9.62 \\times 10^{-8} kg / s$ \\\\\\hline \n    \\end{tabular}}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\nResults from a typical run with these parameters and at temperature\n$T=40$ $K$ are shown in Fig.\\ref{495_T_40_three_plots.png}. In the\nleft panel a box is shown at the beginning of the run. All laths are\ncolored blue indicating that none of them is strongly bound to any of\nthe others. In the middle panel the same box is shown at time $t=\n50000 $, which corresponds to $0.5$ $seconds$ in SI units. It is\nclearly seen that several laths have collected into short chains, also\ncalled whiskers from now on. Laths which are connected through a\nsequence of consecutive strong bonds are given the same\ncolor. Different colors correspond to different whiskers. In the right\npanel, the same box is shown at $t= 20000000$, which corresponds to\n$200$ $seconds$ in SI units. The box has now reached equilibrium and\nseveral long whiskers are observed.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\nIn this section we describe the results of our simulations. First we\ndescribe the approach to equilibrium of simulations boxes which were\ninitially either fully disordered or fully ordered. This gives\ninformation about typical time scales in the system. We also briefly\nanalyze the structure of final equilibrium boxes. In a second\nsubsection we describe the rheological properties of our systems, with\nspecial attention being given to the gel transition.\n\n\\subsection{Time evolution of formation of whiskers and equilibrium distributions of lengths}\n\nAs we have seen in the previous section, the model parameters chosen\nin this study lead to the formation of whiskers during simulations\nstarting at time zero with completely disordered boxes. In this\nsection we analyze how this structure evolves with time. To fully\ncharacterize the structure of the whiskers we studied several\ncharacteristics: its length as a function of time,in number of laths\nper whisker; the number of whiskers formed in the simulation box, as a\nfunction of time; the total material in whiskers as function of time,\nand the histogram of distribution of whisker sizes.\n\nIn\n\\ref{848_847_846_845_844_843_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several.pdf}\nwe present, for various temperatures, the time evolution of the number\nof whiskers in our boxes. The left panel corresponds to those that\nstarted with randomly distributed laths, while the right hand side\npanel presents data for boxes starting from fully ordered boxes,\n\\textit{i.e.} boxes in which all laths were collected in one long\nwhisker. Only the first five seconds are shown.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm,bb=0 0 842 595]{FIG5.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{848_847_846_845_844_843_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several.pdf}\n  Number of whiskers as function of time, for 6 different\n  temperatures (in Kelvin); first $5$ $s$; average over 20 simulations.  \\textit{(Left)}\n  initially disordered configuration, the number of whiskers reaches a\n  higher plateau for higher temperatures. \\textit{(Right)} initially ordered\n  configuration. The only discernible difference between ordered and\n  disordered initial configurations after a few seconds is a lower\n  plateau for the high temperature average number of whiskers in the\n  case of initially ordered simulation.  (\\textit{Color online.})}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor temperatures substantially larger than $T_0$, large numbers of\nwhiskers (necessarily small) are observed after the first one tenth of a\nsecond. In boxes starting from disorder these are obtained by\naggregation of laths, while in boxes starting from the ordered\nstructure these are obtained by disintegration of the initially\navailable very long whisker. After the first one tenth of a second\nhardly any changes occur in the number of whiskers in these\nboxes. Notice that the various plateau values are not equal for\ncorresponding temperatures in the left and right hand side\npanels. This is due to the fact that with our code the identification\nof whiskers is history dependent, as already mentioned in the previous\nsection. This somewhat unrealistic aspect only affects the numbers of\nvery short whiskers.\n\nFor temperatures of the order of $T_0$ or less, in boxes starting from\ndisorder, again a large number of whiskers is formed within the first\nfew tenths of a second. From then on the number of whiskers start to\ngradually decrease with increasing time. This is due to the fact that\ninitially only very small whiskers are formed, which then start to\nmerge into longer whiskers. Eventually, equilibrium distributions of\nlengths occur, depending on the temperature. For these temperatures,\nboxes starting from ordered configurations behave slightly different\nthan those starting from disorder. Again, as in the high temperature\ncase, the long initial whiskers start to disintegrate, but this time\nincreasingly slower with decreasing temperatures. There are still\novershoots in the numbers of whiskers after which the distributions of\nwhiskers begin to rearrange in order to approach the appropriate\nequilibrium distributions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm,bb=0 0 439 583]{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several_long.pdf} \n\\caption{\n  \\label{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several_long.pdf}\nNumber\n  of whiskers as function of time, for different temperatures; average\n  over 20 simulations; initially ordered configuration. After the\n  initial sharp growth in number of whiskers there is a decay to a\n  plateau value that depends on the temperature.  (\\textit{Color online.})}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn\n\\ref{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanNwhisker_several_long.pdf}\nwe again present the time evolution of the number of stickers for the\nsame temperatures as above, but this time for a much longer time span\nof $40$ $s$. Since there is no difference after the first five seconds\nbetween the simulations starting from disorder and those starting from\norder, except for the very high temperatures, we restrict the data\nhere to those of boxes starting from ordered structures. The main\nconclusion from theses runs is that it is safe to assume that\nequilibrium distributions have developed only after about twenty to\ntwenty five seconds, depending on temperature.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm,bb=0 0 842 595]{FIG7.pdf} \n\\caption\n        {\n\\label{FIG7.pdf}\nAverage number of laths per whisker, as function of temperature; first\n$5$ $s$; for 20 simulations.

(\\textit{Color online.})}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\ref{FIG7.pdf} shows the transient behavior, initial $4$\nseconds, of the average number of laths per whisker,\n$<N_{laths/whisker}>$, for both initially disordered and ordered\nconfigurations. Notice that the vertical axes are on log scales to\nmore easily span a broad range of values.  Both plots show the\nexpected behavior: a steady increase of the number of laths per\nwhisker, for the initially disordered configurations; a breaking up of\nthe initially available whisker spanning the whole box, followed by a\nsteady increase of the number of laths per whisker for the initially\nordered simulations. Again, the lower the temperature, the slower is\nthe time evolution of the towards the final plateau\nvalues. \\ref{842_841_840_839_838_837_bigRUNS__meanRODSinWHISKER_b.pdf}\nshows the long time behavior, up to $40$ $s$, for the initially\nordered simulations. As before we notice that up to twenty five\nseconds are needed before the systems reach equilibrium. Notice also\nthat the high temperature systems reach only average values of two\nlaths per whisker, the minimum value to form a whisker; as the\ntemperature decreases the plateau values grow to values of about ten\nfor the lowest temperature.\n\nIt is interesting to have a look at the time evolution of the total\nnumber of laths taking part in whiskers. These results are shown in\n\\ref{FIG10.pdf}. Again, in the left panel results refer to\nsystems starting from disorder, while the right panel refers to\nsystems starting from order. It is seen that in systems starting from\ndisorder the total material in whiskers is monotonically increasing,\nwhile with systems starting from ordered boxes the total material in\nwhiskers is almost constant; an initial large whisker may split into\nsome whiskers, but does not result into individual laths. It is\ninteresting to notice that after five seconds all simulations have\nreached their steady state values. This means that after this time the\nonly thing that happens is a rearrangement of the laths in the\nwhiskers in order to approach the appropriate equilibrium\ndistributions. This process takes about twenty seconds.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf}\nHistogram of laths per whisker; for $10$ different seeds of the random\nnumber generator; previously equilibrated by $40$ $s$, and continued\nby $40$ $s$; at a temperature of $80$ $K$; each simulation having\n$512$ laths.

The total number of sampled whiskers for this plot is $23835$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNext, we are interested in the length-distributions of the whiskers in\nequilibrium. In \\ref{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf} we present the\ndistribution of lengths in boxes with temperature $T=80$ $K$. The plot\nis based on the results of $10$ simulations, starting with different\nseeds for the random number generators and equilibrated for $40$ $s$,\nafter which production runs of $40$ $s$ each were started. As is clear\nfrom the plot, the lengths of whiskers are exponentially distributed,\nwith a mean value of $8.28$ laths per whisker. This results in a slope\nin \\ref{770_LOGhistoLATHS.pdf} of $\\lambda = 1/8.28 \\approx\n0.121$. The exponential distribution allows for only very few long\nwhiskers; in the present case the longest whiskers found have lengths\nof about $90$ laths. Nevertheless, such long whiskers quickly deplete\nthe pool of laths, which leads to severe finite size effects for\ntemperatures of about $80$ $K$ or less. This is clearly seen in\n\\ref{836__LOGlathsINwhiskerAFO_invTEMP.pdf} and \\ref{836__RodsINwhiskerAFO_TEMP.pdf} where we have plotted the average lengths of\nwhiskers as a function of inverse temperature. The distribution\nroughly behaves as described in the paper by Cates and Candau on\nworm-like micelles \\cite{0953-8984-2-33-001}. In this case the expressions relating the average number of laths per whisker and the temperature are:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nonumber  \\ln\\left(N_{laths/whisker} -2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\phi +\\frac{\\epsilon}{2k_BT} \\ \\ \\mbox{ for low temperatures }\\\\\n  \\ln\\left(N_{laths/whisker} -2\\right) =  \\ln \\phi +\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_BT} \\ \\ \\mbox{ for high temperatures }\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nOur system recovers, quantitatively, the expected trend for low\ntemperatures.  The discrepancy with the theory may come from the fact\nthat the boxes have very low number of laths in the simulation box\ncompared to the real system; with only 512 of them, so there may be\nsize effects. This effect is also amplified if we take into the fact\nthat appearance of large whiskers is a rare event.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering \\includegraphics[width=14cm,bb=0 0 842 595]{FIG10.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{FIG10.pdf} \nTotal material in whiskers (as the product of the average number of\nwhiskers and the average laths per whisker), for different\ntemperatures (in Kelvin); as a function of time and for the first $5$\n$s$ of the evolution. \\textit{(Left)} Initially disordered\nconfiguration. \\textit{(Right)} Initially ordered configuration.

(\\textit{Color online.})}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn this section we study the rheological properties of our system. In\nparticular we will investigate how the shear relaxation modulus varies\nwith temperature, and how these variations are related to changes of\nthe distribution of whiskers.\n\n\nIn \\ref{862_GofTIMEseveral.pdf} we present the shear relaxation\nmodulus $G(t)$ as a function of time for various temperatures. Since\nwe are not aiming to study rheological properties like the shear\nstorage and loss moduli, $G'$ and $G\"$ respectively, in great detail,\nwe did not push calculations of the shear relaxation modulus to\nconvergence for times larger than a few seconds. It is clear from\nFig.\\ref{862_GofTIMEseveral.pdf} that the plateau value at early times\nquickly increases with decreasing temperature.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{835_GofTEMPseveral.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{835_GofTEMPseveral.pdf}\nPlateau value for $G$, as\n  function of $T$.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{835_GofN_avseveral.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{835_GofN_avseveral.pdf}\nPlateau value for $G$, as\n  function of the number length.}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn \\ref{835_GofTEMPseveral.pdf} we present these plateau values\nas a function of temperature. As is clear from this plot, the zero\nshear plateau values smoothly increase with decreasing time, up to\ntemperatures of about 200 K. At lower temperatures they fluctuate\naround an average value of about $170$ kPa. This is probably due to\nfinite size effects as the exponential length distribution becomes\nseverely perturbed since the box can not accommodate sufficiently long\nwhiskers. This has already been noticed above when discussing the\naverage whisker length as function of temperature.\n\nIn \\ref{835_GofN_avseveral.pdf} we plot the same data, but now\nagainst the average number of laths per whisker. For small values of\n$<N_{laths/whisker}>$, $G_{t\\rightarrow 0}$ smoothly increases with\nincreasing $<N_{laths/whisker}>$. For large values of the latter, the\nzero shear plateau fluctuates around a constant value. \n\n\nNext we recall that the experimental determination of the gel\ntransition is usually based on values of $G'$ and $G''$ at a frequency\nof one Hertz. If we now return to the shear relaxation modulus as a\nfunction of time (see \\ref{862_GofTIMEseveral.pdf}), we notice\nthat at times less than about one second high temperature $G(t)'s$\nhave decayed to very small values, while low temperature $G(t)'s$ have\nnot decayed at all. At intermediate temperatures the shear relaxation\nmodulus for $t=1 s$ sharply rises. Therefore, in\n\\ref{compare_791_with_812_fitGpGppAFOT.pdf} we plot the\nstorage and loss moduli at one Hertz as a function of temperature.  It\nis clear from this plot that for temperatures below about $400 K$ the\nsystem behaves basically elastic, while for temperatures above $400 K$\nthe system is predominantly viscous. We therefore conclude that\naccording to the usual rheological definition a gel transition occurs\nat about $400 K$. A similar behavior has been reported in rheological experiments of gelation of P3HT \\cite{doi:10.1021/ma202564k}.\n\nFrom the above results we come to the conclusion that the gel\ntransition in whisker forming systems is not a real transition, but\ndepends very much the definition being used. Moreover, being used to\ndifferent strengths of everyday forces and times will define the gel\ntransition using a different frequency, and arrive at much lower gel\ntransition temperatures.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm,bb=0 0 585 441]{compare_791_with_812_fitGpGppAFOT.pdf} \n\\caption{\n\\label{compare_791_with_812_fitGpGppAFOT.pdf}\nOscillatory\n  shear numerical experiment.

It is inspired in\nthe $\\pi - \\pi$ stacking interaction between polythiophenes.  In the\ncrystallized state the planes defined by the backbone of this\nmolecules lie parallel to each other forming long threads (up to the\n$\\mu m$ scale), called \\emph{whiskers} in the literature.  (For\nexample, a P3HT molecule of of contour length of 65 nm, produces\nwhiskers of $15 \\sim 20$ nm width, 5nm thick -two or three chain\nlayers-, and $10 \\mu m$ long \\cite{Lim201014}).\n\nWe propose to model the molecule as a long slender plane, i.e., with a\nhigh aspect ratio between the two in-plane directions; which we call a\n\\emph{lath}. A lath is defined to remain \\emph{free} if the energy of\ninteraction with all its neighbors is above some minimum threshold\n(small in absolute value or positive). On the contrary a lath within a\nwhisker is \\emph{stuck} to its two closest neighbors and does not\ninteract with the others.\n\nThe potential energy depends on a single energetic parameter, and also\non the history of the system; having slightly different expressions\nfor two, three and four body interactions. This allows for a very fast\nalgorithm, that can be used to study the rheology of the system.\n\nGiven our choice of the parameters, we obtain a whisker formation\nprocess that reaches an equilibrium state in matter of twenty to\ntwenty five seconds, depending on the temperature. The distribution\nof number of laths per whisker, which depends on the temperature, has\nan exponential shape. For $T=80$ $K$, this gives a mean of $8.28$ laths\nper whisker; similar to the case of worm-like micelles.\n\nOur system, while being very simple, does reproduce the gel transition\nthat happens in the case of P3HT in solution. An oscillatory shear\nexperiment that measures $G'$ and $G''$ while slowly decreasing the\ntemperature $8$ $K$ each $1$ $s$, gives rise to a transition from\nliquid to gel. As the transition is the product of the formation of\nthe whiskers, we conclude that part of the rheological changes can be\naccounted only to the fact of the whisker formation. \n\nIt has been reported in the literature an hysteresis between the\nramping up and down of the gelation process\n\\cite{doi:10.1021/ma202564k}. Our system does not show this\nbehavior. A possible reason is the absence of branching in our\nsystem. Not having this possibility makes the system pseudo-one\ndimensional; and since there are no phase transitions for one\ndimensional structures, while for higher dimensional there are both\npercolation and phase transitions, it is expected that branching would\nprovide such transitions.\n\nFurther improvements to the present model include the study of the\ninteraction between sphere-like particles, like the PCBM or C60, with\nthe laths. It could also be important to study the effect on the\nalignment that can be obtained by including a second kind of lath,\nthat not necessarily shares the aromatic interaction; as for instance\n gold nanorods \\cite{doi:10.1021/ma402179w}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have investigated the gel transition in $\\pi$-stacking long laths,\nbeing prototype for moderately long stiff aromatic polymers. The\n$\\pi$-stacking bonds allow for the creation of long whiskers of\nconsecutively stacked laths.  We did not allow for branching of such\nwhiskers, thereby preventing the occurrence of extended\nthree-dimensional networks.  In particular, the pseudo one-dimensional\ncharacter of the whiskers does not allow for structural transitions\nwith varying temperatures that could depend on the direction of the\ntemperature gradient; in other words, hysteresis is not present in the\ngel-sol transition. This character also forces their length\ndistribution to be exponential.  As a result, only very few long\nwhiskers occur amidst a see of many smaller whiskers.  Chances of\nhaving mechanically percolating structures are therefore very low.\nNevertheless, we have found that with the usual definition of gel\ntransition, occurring at a temperature where the ratio of the storage\nand loss moduli at a frequency of one Hertz changes from values larger\nthan one to values lower than one, such a transition indeed does\noccur. Our main conclusion therefore is that the occurrence of a gel\ntransition does not necessarily imply that percolating three\ndimensional structures have developed in the system.\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\n\nSome of the simulations for this paper used computational time from\nthe ``Centro de Informatica y Biolog\\'\\i a Computacional BIOS'', and\nran through the ``Red Nacional Acad\\'emica de Tecnolog\\'\\i a Avanzada,\nRENATA''.
