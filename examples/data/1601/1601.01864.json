e.g., carbon nanotubes, quantum dots,\nnano particles, has been done \nowing  to  its technological  importance\n\\cite{wolf2008nanophysics,ozin2009nanochemistry}.\nAs is well known, nano particles play a key role for applications \nsuch as catalytic reactions in fuel cells \n\\cite{Haruta1987AuCatalyst,Haruta:2005fk}.\nThough these nano size materials are widely manipulated and synthesized, \nit has been unclear how the materials are dynamically organized microscopically.\nIn other words, fundamental dynamical aspects of nano materials such as\ntransport mechanisms of atoms in small and \nfinite materials have not been fully understood yet.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the {\\em rapid diffusion}  which is a \ncharacteristic dynamical behavior peculiar to nano materials\nhas been found experimentally in nano metal and alkali halide particles \n\\cite{yasuda1994csd,yasuda1992sos,yasuda1992saz,kimura2000AHSM,kimura2002smb}.\nThe experimental results reveal that \nthe solid diffusion in nano clusters occurs considerably faster \nthan the diffusion in bulk solids, \nand that such a rapid diffusion is \nenhanced by the smallness of the system.\nElucidation of the atomistic process \nunderlying this phenomenon lead us to \na deeper understanding \nof the atomic motion in nano size material with a surface. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rapid diffusion in metal nano particles, which is called \n{\\em Spontaneous Alloying} (SA), \nhas been experimentally observed {\\it in situ}, for the first time, \nusing transmission electron microscopy by Yasuda and Mori \n\\cite{yasuda1994csd,yasuda1992sos,yasuda1992saz}.\nAccording to their observations,\n{{SA}} is the phenomenon that\nnano size core-shell type bimetallic clusters prepared \nby vacuum deposition of metal atoms onto \na cluster of another kind of metal,\ne.g., gold clusters covered with copper atoms,\nquickly transform into homogeneous alloy clusters \nwithout melting even at room temperature.\nThe time needed for the clusters to be alloyed\nis much shorter than that of bulk bimetals.\nA rough estimation tells that\nthe diffusion of Au in nano clusters is nine orders of magnitude \nfaster than that in bulk systems.\n\n\nShimizu and his coworkers have studied this very peculiar diffusion\nphenomenon by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using \ntwo dimensional Morse models.\nThey suggested that surface melting peculiar to nano metal clusters\nplays a crucial role in the onset of {{SA}} \\cite{shimizu1998cds,shimizu2001sab}.\nIt is well-known that the surface melting in a nano particle occurs even \nat a temperature considerably \nlower than its melting point.\nIn their MDs, the surface melting was observed as \nfrequent rearrangements of the surface atoms \n\\cite{garrigos1989mlp,PhysRevB.57.13430}.\nThey paid particular attention to the motion of core atoms \nwhich were initially encapsulated \ninside the cluster.\nThey found that surface melting\nenables these core atoms to move collectively\nwithout breaking into pieces \nand thus expose themselves to the surface. \nThe collection of core atoms is dispersed by the surface melting \nwhen it becomes part of the surface.  \nThe mixing process of the core atoms with the surface atoms caused\nby such an atomic motion is called\nas {\\em Surface Peeling Mechanism (SPM)}\n\\cite{shimizu1998cds,shimizu2001sab}.\nMoreover, it has been verified that the SPM similarly \noccurs in many-body potential models different\nfrom Morse type models.\n\\cite{kobayashi2002ids,kobayashi2003akt,sawada2003mds}.\nRestructuring of cluster shapes by complex collective motions\nhas also been reported in growth simulations of binary metal clusters\nwith  many-body potential \\cite{Baletto:2003fk}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{AHSM-concept.eps}\n \\caption{\\footnotesize\n Schematic

coworkers,\nand they called it {\\em Spontaneous Mixing (SM) phenomenon}\n\\cite{kimura2000AHSM,kimura2002smb}.\nAs shown by the schematic pictures of \nthe phenomenon in figure \\ref{fig:SM-concept},\n{{SM}} is rapid intermixing of AH clusters covered with\nanother pair of alkali halide at room temperature.\nKimura {\\it et al.} found that\n{{SM}} occurs even in {{AH}} clusters as large as about\n$200$ nano meter (nm) in size.\nThis is much larger than the maximum size of metal clusters\nfor which {{SA}} is observed.\nThey pointed out the similarities between {{SA}} and {{SM}}, \nsince they are both considered as a manifestation of rapid diffusion \nof constituent atoms peculiar to small clusters.\nHowever, there exists an essential difference between them.  \nKimura{\\it et al} concluded that one of the most important \ncontrolling factors\nof {{SM}} is the minimum ratio of ionic radii contained in \n{{AH}} clusters \\cite{kimura2000AHSM,kimura2002smb}.\nHowever, at a microscopic level, the rapid \ndiffusion mechanism of constituent atoms has not been clarified yet.\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, we investigate\nthe similarities and the essential differences between {{SM}} \nin AH clusters and {{SA}} in metal clusters at an atomistic level.\nIn particular, we are much interested in whether the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}}, \nwhich plays the key role in {{SA}}, is similarly important for {{SM}}, or not.\n\nIn section \\ref{Sec:Method}, our numerical model together with \nour method of research are described, and the initial configurations and \nan indicator of intermixing, which are employed in the MD simulation,\nare introduced.\nIn Sec.~\\ref{Sec:results-1}, \nwe show the results for the direct observation of the MDs, and \nquantitative analyses for the intermixing process, namely, \nthe dependence upon temperature, cluster size, and the\nspecies of ions forming AH clusters are examined, paying\nparticular care to checking whether the cluster is melting or not.\nWe investigate the diffusion mechanism in Sec~\\ref{Sec:results-2}\nby observation of the motion of ions and vacancies inside the clusters,\nthen show that ions in the clusters diffused by the Vacancy Mechanism.\nFinally, in Sec~\\ref{Sec:discussion}, \nwe  discuss the rate of the diffusion observed in our MDs,\nand the reason for the rapidness of diffusion in small {{AH}} clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Model and Numerical

guest anions are\nshown by grey, white and black circles, respectively.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Initial configurations and numerical method}\n\\label{Subsec:init-conf}\n\n\nNext we explain the configurations of\nions in a cluster at the initial time ($t=0$).\nWe employed the configurations\nin which several ions were removed from the cubic cluster\nwith simple cubic lattice, specifically\n$(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 - 3)$,\n$(7 \\times 7 \\times 7 - 3)$ and \n$(9 \\times 9 \\times 9 - 3)$ structure (see Fig \\ref{fig:init-conf}),\nwhere $(n \\times n \\times n - \\alpha)$ denotes the resultant \nstructure where $\\alpha$ ions were removed from \nan edge of a cluster forming cubic\nstructure composed of $n \\times n \\times n$ atoms.\nThe reason for such a choice of initial configuration\nis that atomic vacancies and their migration are indispensable\nfor intermixing in AH clusters to be initiated, as will be\ndescribed later.\n\nIt is a difficult problem to prepare an ``ideal'' structure of\nthe initial configuration for rapid diffusion, because\nthe natural configurations of atoms in the initial stage \nhas not been clarified in any experiments.\nIf one chooses a {\\it close-packed structure} as the initial\nconfiguration, [the $(n \\times n \\times n)$ cubic structure\nis one of the close-packed structures of AH nano particles which is\nquite stable], it is easily expected that no intermixing\nphenomenon will be observed.\nDue to the stability of the closed-packed structure\none has to wait a very long time for any atom to migrate \neven to its nearest neighbor site.\nFor this reason, we employed non-close-packed structures.\n(The stability and reliability of this type of non-close-packed structure\nhas been discussed in experiments and ab initio calculations \n\\cite{Aguado2001AbInitioClusters}.)\n\n\nTo constitute an initial configuration, we firstly took \na $[(n-2) \\times (n-2) \\times (n-2)]$ cubic cluster\nwhich is constituted of host anions and cations. Next, \nwe cover the cluster with a mono layer of alkali halides\nwhich consist of guest anions and cations.\nFinally some ions ( the total number is $\\alpha$ ) were removed from \none of the twelve edges of the cubic cluster.\nWe chose $\\alpha = 3$ in this study.\nAs a result, we prepared an initial configuration \nwith three neighboring vacancies on a surface edge,\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:init-conf}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{init-confs.eps} \n\\caption{\\footnotesize \nTypical initial configurations for the MD simulations of AH clusters.\nThree ions were removed from one of the edges of \n$(n \\times n \\times n)$ shape AH clusters, i.e.,\nthere are three atomic vacancies on the edge,\nwhere guest, host anions and common cations are colored \nblue, yellow and grey.\n}\n\\label{fig:init-conf}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\label{Subsec:method}\n\n\n\nWe executed MDs under the isoenergetic condition\nby the velocity form of the Verlet algorithm,\nwhere the time step was typically $10$ femto seconds.\nNumerical results described below are mainly based \non the simulation of KCl-KBr clusters.\nWe also mention some results of the simulation for \nNaCl-NaBr, RbCl-RbBr and KBr-KI clusters.\nNote that Cl and Br are respectively\nhost and guest anions in KCl-KBr, NaCl-NaBr and RbCl-RbBr experiments, \nand that Br and I  are respectively host and guest anions in KBr-KI experiments.\n\n\nFirst of all, employing the velocity scaling method in time evolution\nwe raised the temperature of a cluster\nhaving the initial configuration shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:init-conf}\nfrom ground state to a desired temperature.\nHere, we used the micro canonical kinetic temperature $T$ defined by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 9681, "prevtext": "\nwhere $r_{ij}$ is the distance between $i$-th and $j$-th ions,\n$|{\\mathbf}{q}_i -

Next, \nwe cover the cluster with a mono layer of alkali halides\nwhich consist of guest anions and cations.\nFinally some ions ( the total number is $\\alpha$ ) were removed from \none of the twelve edges of the cubic cluster.\nWe chose $\\alpha = 3$ in this study.\nAs a result, we prepared an initial configuration \nwith three neighboring vacancies on a surface edge,\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:init-conf}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{init-confs.eps} \n\\caption{\\footnotesize \nTypical initial configurations for the MD simulations of AH clusters.\nThree ions were removed from one of the edges of \n$(n \\times n \\times n)$ shape AH clusters, i.e.,\nthere are three atomic vacancies on the edge,\nwhere guest, host anions and common cations are colored \nblue, yellow and grey.\n}\n\\label{fig:init-conf}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\label{Subsec:method}\n\n\n\nWe executed MDs under the isoenergetic condition\nby the velocity form of the Verlet algorithm,\nwhere the time step was typically $10$ femto seconds.\nNumerical results described below are mainly based \non the simulation of KCl-KBr clusters.\nWe also mention some results of the simulation for \nNaCl-NaBr, RbCl-RbBr and KBr-KI clusters.\nNote that Cl and Br are respectively\nhost and guest anions in KCl-KBr, NaCl-NaBr and RbCl-RbBr experiments, \nand that Br and I  are respectively host and guest anions in KBr-KI experiments.\n\n\nFirst of all, employing the velocity scaling method in time evolution\nwe raised the temperature of a cluster\nhaving the initial configuration shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:init-conf}\nfrom ground state to a desired temperature.\nHere, we used the micro canonical kinetic temperature $T$ defined by\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{align}\nT = \\frac{2 \\left< {K} \\right>}{(3N-6) k_B},\n\\label{kinetic-temperature-def}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle T=\\frac{2\\left&lt;{K}\\right&gt;}{(3N-6)k_{B}},\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>=</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\u27e8</mo><mi>K</mi><mo>\u27e9</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>B</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mstyle></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01864.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere ${\\mathbf}{e}_1$, ${\\mathbf}{e}_2$ and ${\\mathbf}{e}_3$\nare the three independent vectors\nwhich are along the crystal axis and\nperpendicular to three surfaces of a cubic cluster.\nWe shall call this the ``principal radial distance''.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{inv-layer-model-mono.eps}\n \\caption{\\footnotesize\n A schematic figure of an AH cluster is represented \n by a two-dimensional square cluster.\n (a) A guest anion is colored by black, \n and host anions and common cations are represented \n by grey and white circles, respectively.\n In the case that the guest anion which is initially located \n at $(x^c,y^c)=(4d,4d)$ occasionally hops along the surface\n to the lattice site $(x_c,y_c)=(0,4d)$ (surface diffusion),\n the distance, ${r_i^c}$, keeps the constant value \n $4d$  during the hopping process.\n However, the distance, ${r_i^c}$ decreases to $3d$, when \n the initial guest anion hops to an inside site, e.g., $(x_c,y_c)=(3d,3d)$.\n (b) \n We intentionally introduce atomic vacancies \n on the cluster surface by removing some atoms.  \n The white lines indicate the layers which virtually decompose \n a cluster into parts. \n We define the index for the layers, which is allocated \n by ascending order from the surface, \n because it is helpful for a simple indication for the penetration depth of \n the guest anions (See SubSec.~\\ref{Subsec:T-depend}).\n}\n \\label{fig:invade100-model}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:invade100-model}~(b),\na typical two dimensional example is shown.\nEach layer is denoted by  $0$th, $1$st,\n$\\cdots$, $\\ell$-th, $\\cdots$, $L$-th layer \nfrom the center to the surface.

that all the values of the averaged distance ${R_g}$s \ndecrease monotonically and their behaviors are similar to that of KCl-KBr ones.\nIn fact, one can verify that \n${R_g}$ for {(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(NaCl)$_{14}$(NaBr)$_{47}$} and {(KBr)$_{14}$(KI)$_{47}$}  exhibits\na common decreasing rate, while \n{(RbCl)$_{14}$(RbBr)$_{47}$} shows a rather slow decreasing trend.\nNote that ${R_g}$ does not reach the ideal value,\n$\\left< {{R_g}} \\right> = 0.885$, in all cases.\n\nTypical time evolutions of Lindemann's index,\n$\\delta$, are depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ions-comp}~(b),\nwhere the points are plotted with $200$ ps interval.\nDuring {{SM}}, all the values of $\\delta $ are about $0.05$ \nwhich is smaller than the melting criterion $0.1$.\nTherefore, these clusters similarly show full intermixing \nin solid phase without exception. \n\n\nAccording to the experiment for AH clusters by Kimura {\\it et al.}, \none of the dominantly controlling\nfactors of {{SM}} is the minimum ratio \nof ionic radii of alkali halide constituent of clusters.\nMore precisely, the intermixing occurred in the clusters whose minimum ratio of\nthe ionic radii is larger than 68 \\%\n\\cite{kimura2000AHSM,kimura2002smb}.\nAccording to this criterion, KCl-KBr and RbCl-RbBr clusters\nshould exhibit intermixing,\nbecause the ratios of radii between cation and anion \nare (K/Br = $0.68$), (Rb/Br = $0.76$) and (K/Cl = $0.73$), respectively.\nOn the contrary, \none should expect the absence of intermixing\nin NaCl-NaBr and KBr-KI clusters (Na/Br = $0.5$ and K/I = $0.62$), \nwhere the ratio of the radii of anions, Cl/Br and Br/I are $0.93$ and $0.90$,\nrespectively.\nHowever, the present simulation results predict that there exists\nintermixing in NaCl-NaBr cluster like in other AH clusters. \nThis discrepancy suggests that\nthe dependence will be reversed in smaller AH clusters\nsuch as in our MD's results,\nbecause the clusters employed in the experiments\nare much larger than those used in our simulations\n(the size of clusters in the experiments was several hundred nano meters).\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Temperature-dependence}\n\\label{Subsec:T-depend}\n\n\n\nAccording to Yasuda and Mori, {{SA}} is enhanced for metal clusters,\nas the temperature is raised.\nHowever, no experimental observation showing\nthe role of temperature is known for {{SM}} in AH clusters.\nIn this subsection, we probe the temperature-dependence\nof intermixing in AH clusters.\nWe calculated the time for ${R_g}(t)$ \nto reach a certain value for various initial temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{inv-deg-T-depend-KClBr-122.eps}\n\n\n

as the temperature is raised.\nIn short, raising temperature promotes the diffusion in\nbinary AH clusters.\nThis dependence on temperature is quantitatively consistent with\nthe conventional  diffusion process and other studies of\nmetal nano particles \n\\cite{shimizu1998cds,shimizu2001sab,\nkobayashi2002ids,kobayashi2003akt,sawada2003mds}.\nArrhenius law for a diffusion of atoms in solid

{(NaCl)$_{14}$(NaBr)$_{47}$} and {(KBr)$_{14}$(KI)$_{47}$}  exhibits\na common decreasing rate, while \n{(RbCl)$_{14}$(RbBr)$_{47}$} shows a rather slow decreasing trend.\nNote that ${R_g}$ does not

are plotted with $200$ ps interval.\nDuring {{SM}}, all the values of $\\delta $ are about $0.05$ \nwhich is smaller than the melting criterion $0.1$.\nTherefore, these clusters similarly show full intermixing \nin solid phase without exception. \n\n\nAccording to the experiment for AH clusters by Kimura {\\it et al.}, \none of the dominantly controlling\nfactors of {{SM}} is the minimum ratio \nof ionic radii of alkali halide constituent of clusters.\nMore precisely, the intermixing occurred in the clusters whose minimum ratio of\nthe ionic radii is larger than 68 \\%\n\\cite{kimura2000AHSM,kimura2002smb}.\nAccording to this criterion, KCl-KBr and RbCl-RbBr clusters\nshould exhibit intermixing,\nbecause the ratios of radii between cation and anion \nare (K/Br = $0.68$), (Rb/Br = $0.76$) and (K/Cl = $0.73$), respectively.\nOn the contrary, \none should expect the absence of intermixing\nin NaCl-NaBr and KBr-KI clusters (Na/Br = $0.5$ and K/I = $0.62$), \nwhere the ratio of the radii of anions, Cl/Br and Br/I are $0.93$ and $0.90$,\nrespectively.\nHowever, the present simulation results predict that there exists\nintermixing in NaCl-NaBr cluster like in other AH clusters. \nThis discrepancy suggests that\nthe dependence will be reversed in smaller AH clusters\nsuch as in our MD's results,\nbecause the clusters employed in the experiments\nare much larger than those used in our simulations\n(the size of clusters in the experiments was several hundred nano meters).\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Temperature-dependence}\n\\label{Subsec:T-depend}\n\n\n\nAccording to Yasuda and Mori, {{SA}} is enhanced for metal clusters,\nas the temperature is raised.\nHowever, no experimental observation showing\nthe role of temperature is known for {{SM}} in AH clusters.\nIn this subsection, we probe the temperature-dependence\nof intermixing in AH clusters.\nWe calculated

focusing attention on the core of the cluster.\nThe results of these observations imply that the diffusion mechanism \nof intermixing is the so-called {{Vacancy Mechanism}}

conditions for the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}} to work.\nIndeed, the previous results based on 2D Morse model show how \nsurface melting enhances {{SA}} \nby the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}} \\cite{shimizu1998cds,shimizu2001sab}.\nTherefore, it is plausible to expect that the same mechanism similarly works \nin  {{SM}} of AH clusters.\nIn this subsection, we verify the absence\nof surface

> 16\\ \\AA$ is significantly small.\nTherefore, the large value of  $\\delta_i$, which is attributed \nto exceptional atomic motion, has to be ignored \nwhen judging the presence of the surface melting.\n\nThus, the numerical results concerning the individual Lindemann's index\nclearly show that the surface of {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}  \nis not in a melting state during {{SM}}.\nThe

\\label{fig:evolve-Ri}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn this subsection, we illustrate the characteristic motion of core ions \nin {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$} during intermixing by observing the radial distance and \nby visualizing the projected positions of the ions.\nWe will come to the following fact: \nBoth results demonstrate that diffusion of the ions \nis dominated by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}}.\n\nLet us summarize how the diffusion mechanism manifests \nin a characteristic motion of ions.\nIf either vacancy or interstitial mechanism is \nresponsible for the intermixing of AH clusters, \nthen core ions of the cluster have to diffuse individually and separately.\nIn contrast, the core ions tend to move simultaneously \nin case that the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}} is responsible for {{SM}}, \nbecause the cluster core is solid-like in the present simulation.\nThus, we can identify the  diffusion mechanism that governs the {{SM}}  \nby focusing on the motion of core ions in AH cluster.\n\n\nNext, we pick up the $27$ core ions which are initially located on \n$(3 \\times 3 \\times 3)$ lattice sites at the center of the cluster.\nThe initial configuration of $27$ core atoms is shown \nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:proj-snap-KClBr726}~(a).\nThe radial distance between the $27$ core ions and the center, say ${r_i^c}$, \nis computed during {{SM}}.\nNotice that ${r_i^c}$ was previously introduced \nin Subsec.~\\ref{Subsec:direct-observation}.\nThe time evolution of ${r_i^c}$ for {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$} is\ndepicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:evolve-Ri}.\n\n\nIt is obvious that the plots corresponding to ${r_i^c}=0\\ \\AA$ \nat $t=0$  keeps on the horizontal line during $t = 0 - 11$ and $17 - 36$ ns.\nThis means that the center ion yielding ${r_i^c}=0\\ \\AA$ keeps its position\nduring these two periods.\nIn contrast, the plots corresponding to ${r_i^c}=2.8\\ \\AA$ at $t=0$ \ntend to jump among the various horizontal lines. \nThat indicates that $26$ ions which are initially belonging to core ions \noften move around from site to site. \nIn other words, a single ion at the center stays \nat the same site for a long time, \nwhile the surrounding $26$ atoms often hop from one layer to another\nindividually and separately.\nThe present  behavior of the core 27 ions and the absence of surface melting\nare incompatible with the description of {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}}.\nConsequently, it strongly suggests that the diffusion inducing {{SM}} \nis caused by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{KClBr-726-800K-all.eps}\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize\n  The snapshots of the ions of

are depicted by black circles, whilst \nthe other 699 ions surrounding 27 core ions are colored yellow.\n\nThe results show that several core ions (black solid circles)\ndiffuse and reach the cluster surface.\nBut most initial core ions remain at the center.\nMoreover, there are no correlated motions of core ions in the snapshots.\nThese snapshots also support the previous observation indicating that \nthe {{Vacancy Mechanism}} is responsible for accomplishing {{SM}} in AH clusters. \nThus, {{SM}} seems to originate from the combined effect\nof the individual diffusion of ions realized by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Visualization of the vacancy

form three zigzag lines.\nOne longer entangled line forms a single loop, and \nthe other two relatively short lines are overlapped with the longer line\n(the two shorter lines cannot be distinguished from the longer line).\nThe dots mean that ions stay for a long time on their lattice points.\nThe broken lines indicates the single hop of an ion from \none occupied site to its second-neighbor unoccupied site,\nwhich is nothing more than the so-called vacancy site.\nConversely, one can say\nthat each of the broken lines indicates a hopping of a vacancy \nin a direction opposite to the ion.\nOne can conclude from Fig.~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms}~(a) that \nsome ions hop from one site to another site \nso as to fill the vacancy created by a prior jump of  \nan another ion. On the other hand,\nalmost all ions remain on the same lattice sites.\nOne can reconfirm this picture by comparing\nFigs~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms}~(a) and (b).\nThe circles in the latter figure indicate the lattice points occupied\nby a vacancy in a particular period $t = 38.1 - 39.4$ ns.\nThe atomic trajectories depicted by the zigzag lines in the former\nfigure correspond to the vacancy sites depicted by circles\nin the latter figure.\nThis figure makes manifest that\nthe atomic trajectory is equivalent to the vacancy trajectory.\n\n\nIt is hard to see the detail,\nbut there coexist three zigzag lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms},\ncorresponding to the trajectories of three vacancies \nin the cluster.\nThe starting points of the vacancies are located on\nthe edge of the initial configuration having a simple cubic structure.\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:init-conf}, \nthese three vacancies are initially aligned along an edge.\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms},\nthis vacancy trajectory forms a round trip loop ---\nit starts from one of the surface vacancy sites,\nwanders deep inside the cluster, and eventually reaches the surface again.\n\n\n\nIt takes a relatively short period of time for a vacancy to travel \nalong the loop.\nDuring the simulation time over $50$ ns, \nthere appear many loops corresponding to the frequent\nmotion of vacancies everywhere inside of {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}.\nThe formation of vacancy hopping paths inside the cluster,\nis quite important to realize  intermixing in {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}.\nIn this way, we are convinced that the {{SM}} is dominated\nby the {\\em Vacancy Mechanism}.\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\section{{Discussions}}}\n\\label{Sec:discussion}\n\n\n\nThe above numerical results gave evidence that\nbinary AH clusters can spontaneously intermix even below their melting points.\nAt a microscopic level, this intermixing is governed by \nmigration of vacancies.\nThe vacancies mediated diffusion is by no means a process specific\nto nanoclusters, but an ordinary process observed\nalso in bulk AH crystal. Although the transport process \nis the same, why is the mixing process in an AH cluster\nmuch faster than in bulk AH? \nBy analyzing the dominant factor controlling the diffusion rate \nin an AH cluster, we discuss the reason why the vacancy mechanism induces \nunexpectedly rapid diffusion in AH clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Diffusion rate in AH clusters}\n\\label{Subsec:diffusion-rate}\n\n\n\nFirstly, to demonstrate how rapid {{SM}} is,\nwe roughly evaluate the diffusion rate in {{AH}} clusters\nby using MD data \\cite{yasuda1992saz,yasuda1992sos}.\nComparing the diffusion rate in cluster to that in bulk crystal\nshows how fast the {{SM}} is.\nBy comparing the diffusion rate in cluster to that in bulk crystal,\none might realize how fast the {{SM}} is.\nIn general, it is difficult to estimate the diffusion rate in finite systems, \nwhere the surface diffusion coexists with bulk diffusion. \nNeglecting the spatial inhomogeneity  \ndue to the presence of the boundary, \nlet us assume that diffusion rate is the same everywhere in the cluster.\nThis simplification enables us to estimate the diffusion rate\nby $\\tau$, which is the time \nspent by the guest atoms migrating over a distance, say $\\Delta r_g'$.\nNote, however, that such a crude estimation often\nleads to  an underestimation.\nThe times required to diffuse over a distance \n$\\Delta r_g' = 0.076 d\\ \\AA = 0.024\\ \\text{nm}$ \nat $700$ K in {(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}\nare evaluated as $\\tau=$18.9, 42.1 and 668 ns, according to\nthe data in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ave-inv-T-depend-KClBr}.\nThe resultant diffusion rates of the clusters are\n$D = 3.1 \\times 10^{-14},\n1.4 \\times 10^{-14}$ and \n$8.6 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$, respectively.\n\n\nSecondly, we estimate the rate of lattice diffusion \nin bulk AH crystal for comparison.\nThe diffusion rate by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}} in solids is usually represented by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 43149, "prevtext": "\nLet us recall that\n{(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$} clusters\nform $({{5} \\times {5} \\times {5} - {3}})$, $({{7} \\times {7} \\times {7} - {3}})$ and $({{9} \\times {9} \\times {9} - {3}})$ \nstructures, and the number of their layers is $L = 2,\\ 3$ and $4$,\nso the corresponding values of ${R_g}^*$ for $\\Delta r_g = 0.076 d \\ \\AA$\nare ${R_g}^* = 0.962,\\ 0.975$ and $0.981$, respectively.\nTherefore, $\\tau_g$ can be translated as the time when ${R_g}(t)$ reaches\n$0.962,\\ 0.975$ and $0.981$ \nfor {(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$},{(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}, respectively.\n\n\n\nFor evaluating $\\tau_g$, we chose the MD results at $700$ K \nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ave-inv-T-depend-KClBr}.\nWith these data we obtained \n$\\tau_g = 18.9$,\\ \n$42.1$,\\ \nand $668$ ns \nfor {(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$} clusters, respectively.\nThus, the time required by guest anions to diffuse \nover the distance increases very rapidly with an increase \nin the size of the cluster, which means that the {{SM}}\nis inhibited in larger clusters.\nIn this sense, we verified the similarities \nin the size-dependence between {{SM}} and {{SA}}.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth to emphasize that \nwe also confirm the same aspect of \nthe size-dependence in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Arrhenius-plot}. \nAs mention in the previous subsection, \nthe activation energy introduced in Eq.~(\\ref{Arrhenius-tau})\nbecomes larger for the larger AH cluster. \nIn both cases, we ascertain that the size of AH cluster affects \nthe mobility of guest anions\nentering the center of the cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\section{{Diffusion mechanism}}}\n\\label{Sec:results-2}\n\n\n\nWe showed that intermixing in AH clusters\noccurred spontaneously in solid phase.\nIn this section, we explore some details of\nthe atomistic diffusion mechanism of the intermixing. \nFirstly, we attempt to quantify the onset of \nsurface melting which is considered to be a necessary condition \nfor the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}}.\nThen we characterize the motion of atoms inside a cluster \nby focusing attention on the core of the cluster.\nThe results of these observations imply that the diffusion mechanism \nof intermixing is the so-called {{Vacancy Mechanism}}  \\cite{shewmon:gds}.\nFinally, by visualizing trajectories of all ions of an {{AH}} cluster\nwe present direct evidence indicating that the diffusion \nis governed by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Surface melting}\n\\label{Subsec:surface-melting}\n\n\nSurface melting of metal clusters\nwhich occurs even at temperatures considerably lower than \ntheir melting points has been\nreported in some experimental studies\n\\cite{Kofman1989630,PhysRevB.57.13430,garrigos1989mlp}.\nAs mentioned in Sec.~\\ref{Sec:Intro}, the surface melting \nis one of the necessary conditions for the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}} to work.\nIndeed, the previous results based on 2D Morse model show how \nsurface melting enhances {{SA}} \nby the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}} \\cite{shimizu1998cds,shimizu2001sab}.\nTherefore, it is plausible to expect that the same mechanism similarly works \nin  {{SM}} of AH

$E_m$ is the activation energy of vacancy diffusion\n$E_{act}$.\nFor instance, the energies in bulk KCl and NaCl crystals are\napproximately $E_f^S \\simeq 2$ eV and $E_m \\simeq 0.9$ eV, \nrespectively \\cite{Kittel2005ed8th}.\nSince $E_f^S$ is Schottky vacancy formation energy \nfor an anion-cation pair,\nthe formation energy of a single vacancy on an anion site \nis roughly estimated to be a half of $E_f^S$, i.e., $E_f \\simeq 1$ eV.\nFor {\\it binary} AH crystals containing two different types of\nanions such as KCl-KBr, only a limited number of experimental \nstudies

diffusion rate in AH cluster is significantly\nmore rapid than in  AH bulk has not been clarified.\nAt first sight, there seems to be no qualitative \ndifference between the diffusion in bulk and that in a cluster.\nIn this subsection, we discuss the factor enhancing\nthe diffusion in AH clusters from the viewpoint of \nthe size-dependence of {\\em vacancy formation energy} $E_f$.\nIn particular, we will demonstrate a decreasing trend of the formation \nenergy with reducing size of AH cluster. \nThis provides evidence\nthat reduction of the cluster size makes it energetically\neasier to generate vacancies causing SM.\n\n\nThe diffusion rate controlling the {{SM}} is determined \nby the vacancy formation energy and the migration energy\nas shown in Eq.~(\\ref{vacancy-diff-const-eq}).\nIt is plausible to expect that the values of these energies\ndepend upon the cluster size like other \nphysical properties exhibiting the size effect.\nIn fact, there are several theoretical studies which point out \nthat the vacancy formation energy $E_f$ in metal clusters depends on the size\nin the metal clusters \\cite{PhysRevB.50.2775,qi2003sdv,muller2007ctv}.\nBut it has not been well studied\nhow the size effect manifests itself in AH clusters.\nIn order to compute the value $E_m$, \nit is necessary to enumerate the reaction paths along which the vacancy hops.\nSince there also exists a large variety of the saddle points\nwhich may contribute to the numerical estimation for $E_m$,\nit is practically hard to calculate $E_m$.\nRather than pursuing the role of $E_m$, in this paper\nwe concentrate on the numerical estimation of $E_f$.\nHere we would like to\nextract an insight about the effect of size\nupon the enhancement of diffusion \nby focusing on the size-dependent feature of $E_f$.\n\n\n\nAccording to the definition of the vacancy formation energy,\n$E_f$ is the energy which is spent for the process \nsuch that a single constituent atom is removed from the target system \nto the surface.\nLet us apply that definition to calculate $E_f$ of\nclusters which have the same number of atoms but different cluster shapes.\nThe value $E_f$ would depend on the shapes\neven if the number of the constituent atoms is the same,\nbecause the energy needed to put a single atom on the surface\ndepends upon the detailed structure of the surface.\nTo avoid the difficulty of accounting for the complicated \nshape-dependence of the cluster,\nwe evaluated $E_f$ of KCl-KBr clusters for a series of the clusters\nforming a simple cubic structure represented by $(n \\times n \\times n)$,\nlocating the vacancy at the center of a cluster.\nIn addition, we applied the following convenient relation \nto evaluate $E_f$ in a cluster composed of $N$ atoms:  \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 57273, "prevtext": "\nand called it {\\em the individual Lindemann's index}.\nThis index is an

absence of surface melting in alkali halide systems\nis consistent with the result by Zykova-Timan {\\it et.~al.}\n\\cite{Zykova-Timan:2005lr}.\nIt strongly suggests that the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}} does not contribute to \nthe intermixing of {{AH}} clusters, unlike metal clusters.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Characteristic motion of core

\\label{fig:evolve-Ri}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn this subsection, we illustrate the characteristic motion of core ions \nin {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$} during intermixing by observing the radial distance and \nby visualizing the projected positions of the ions.\nWe will come to the following fact: \nBoth results demonstrate that diffusion of the ions \nis dominated by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}}.\n\nLet us summarize how the diffusion mechanism manifests \nin a characteristic motion of ions.\nIf either vacancy or interstitial mechanism is \nresponsible for the intermixing of AH clusters, \nthen core ions of the cluster have to diffuse individually and separately.\nIn contrast, the core ions tend to move simultaneously \nin case that the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}} is responsible for {{SM}}, \nbecause the cluster core is solid-like in the present simulation.\nThus, we can identify the  diffusion mechanism that governs the {{SM}}  \nby focusing on the motion of core ions in AH cluster.\n\n\nNext, we pick up the $27$ core ions which are initially located on \n$(3 \\times 3 \\times 3)$ lattice sites at the center of the cluster.\nThe initial configuration of $27$ core atoms is shown \nin Fig.~\\ref{fig:proj-snap-KClBr726}~(a).\nThe radial distance between the $27$ core ions and the center, say ${r_i^c}$, \nis computed during {{SM}}.\nNotice that ${r_i^c}$ was previously introduced \nin Subsec.~\\ref{Subsec:direct-observation}.\nThe time evolution of ${r_i^c}$ for {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$} is\ndepicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:evolve-Ri}.\n\n\nIt is obvious that the plots corresponding to ${r_i^c}=0\\ \\AA$ \nat $t=0$  keeps on the horizontal line during $t = 0 - 11$ and $17 - 36$ ns.\nThis means that the center ion yielding ${r_i^c}=0\\ \\AA$ keeps its position\nduring these two periods.\nIn contrast, the plots corresponding to ${r_i^c}=2.8\\ \\AA$ at $t=0$ \ntend to jump among the various horizontal lines. \nThat indicates that $26$ ions which are initially belonging to core ions \noften move around from site to site. \nIn other words, a single ion at the center stays \nat the same site for a long time, \nwhile the surrounding $26$ atoms often hop from one layer to another\nindividually and separately.\nThe present  behavior of the core 27 ions and the absence of surface melting\nare incompatible with the description of {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}}.\nConsequently, it strongly suggests that the diffusion inducing {{SM}} \nis caused by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n\\centering\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{KClBr-726-800K-all.eps}\n  \\caption{\\footnotesize\n  The snapshots of the ions of

are depicted by black circles, whilst \nthe other 699 ions surrounding 27 core ions are colored yellow.\n\nThe results show that several core ions (black solid circles)\ndiffuse and reach the cluster surface.\nBut most initial core ions remain at the center.\nMoreover, there are no correlated motions of core ions in the snapshots.\nThese snapshots also support the previous observation indicating that \nthe {{Vacancy Mechanism}} is responsible for accomplishing {{SM}} in AH clusters. \nThus, {{SM}} seems to originate from the combined effect\nof the individual diffusion of ions realized by the

form three zigzag lines.\nOne longer entangled line forms a single loop, and \nthe other two relatively short lines are overlapped with the longer line\n(the two shorter lines cannot be distinguished from the longer line).\nThe dots mean that ions stay for a long time on their lattice points.\nThe broken lines indicates the single hop of an ion from \none occupied site to its second-neighbor unoccupied site,\nwhich is nothing more than the so-called vacancy site.\nConversely, one can say\nthat each of the broken lines indicates a hopping of a vacancy \nin a direction opposite to the ion.\nOne can conclude from Fig.~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms}~(a) that \nsome ions hop from one site to another site \nso as to fill the vacancy created by a prior jump of  \nan another ion. On the other hand,\nalmost all ions remain on the same lattice sites.\nOne can reconfirm this picture by comparing\nFigs~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms}~(a) and (b).\nThe circles in the latter figure indicate the lattice points occupied\nby a vacancy in a particular period $t = 38.1 - 39.4$ ns.\nThe atomic trajectories depicted by the zigzag lines in the former\nfigure correspond to the vacancy sites depicted by circles\nin the latter figure.\nThis figure makes manifest that\nthe atomic trajectory is equivalent to the vacancy trajectory.\n\n\nIt is hard to see the detail,\nbut there coexist three zigzag lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms},\ncorresponding to the trajectories of three vacancies \nin the cluster.\nThe starting points of the vacancies are located on\nthe edge of the initial configuration having a simple cubic structure.\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:init-conf}, \nthese three vacancies are initially aligned along an edge.\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:traj-all-atoms},\nthis vacancy trajectory forms a round trip loop ---\nit starts from one of the surface vacancy sites,\nwanders deep inside the cluster, and eventually reaches the surface again.\n\n\n\nIt takes a relatively short period of time for a vacancy to travel \nalong the loop.\nDuring the simulation time over $50$ ns, \nthere appear many loops corresponding to the frequent\nmotion of vacancies everywhere inside of {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}.\nThe formation of vacancy hopping paths inside the cluster,\nis quite important to realize  intermixing in {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}.\nIn this way, we are convinced that the {{SM}} is dominated\nby the {\\em Vacancy Mechanism}.\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\section{{Discussions}}}\n\\label{Sec:discussion}\n\n\n\nThe above numerical results gave evidence that\nbinary AH clusters can spontaneously intermix even below their melting points.\nAt a microscopic level, this intermixing is governed by \nmigration of vacancies.\nThe vacancies mediated diffusion is by no means a process specific\nto nanoclusters, but an ordinary process observed\nalso in bulk AH crystal. Although the transport process \nis the same, why is the mixing process in an AH cluster\nmuch faster than in bulk AH? \nBy analyzing the dominant factor controlling the diffusion rate \nin an AH cluster, we discuss the reason why the vacancy mechanism induces \nunexpectedly rapid diffusion in AH clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Diffusion rate in AH clusters}\n\\label{Subsec:diffusion-rate}\n\n\n\nFirstly, to demonstrate how rapid {{SM}} is,\nwe roughly evaluate the diffusion rate in {{AH}} clusters\nby using MD data \\cite{yasuda1992saz,yasuda1992sos}.\nComparing the diffusion rate in cluster to that in bulk crystal\nshows how fast the {{SM}} is.\nBy comparing the diffusion rate in cluster to that in bulk crystal,\none might realize how fast the {{SM}} is.\nIn general, it is difficult to estimate the diffusion rate in finite systems, \nwhere the surface diffusion coexists with bulk diffusion. \nNeglecting the spatial inhomogeneity  \ndue to the presence of the boundary, \nlet us assume that diffusion rate is the same everywhere in the cluster.\nThis simplification enables us to estimate the diffusion rate\nby $\\tau$, which is the time \nspent by the guest atoms migrating over a distance, say $\\Delta r_g'$.\nNote, however, that such a crude estimation often\nleads to  an underestimation.\nThe times required to diffuse over a distance \n$\\Delta r_g' = 0.076 d\\ \\AA = 0.024\\ \\text{nm}$ \nat $700$ K in {(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}\nare evaluated as $\\tau=$18.9, 42.1 and 668 ns, according to\nthe data in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ave-inv-T-depend-KClBr}.\nThe resultant diffusion rates of the clusters are\n$D = 3.1 \\times 10^{-14},\n1.4 \\times 10^{-14}$ and \n$8.6 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$, respectively.\n\n\nSecondly, we estimate the rate of lattice diffusion \nin bulk AH crystal for comparison.\nThe diffusion rate by the {{Vacancy Mechanism}} in solids is usually represented by\n\n", "index": 25, "text": "\\begin{align}\nD = D_0 \\exp \\left[ - {(E_f + E_m)}/{k_B T} \\right],\n

\\cite{PhysRevB.50.2775,muller2007ctv}.\n\n\nThere are some issues about the applicability \nof the above formula to a cluster. \nStrictly speaking, the formation energy of a vacancy, $E_f$, should be \ndefined as the difference between the energy of a cluster with a vacancy \non the most stable surface position and the energy with the vacancy\nat a position inside the cluster.\nHowever, the latter energy depends on the vacancy's position inside the cluster.\nThus, the effective vacancy formation energy should be estimated \nby averaging $E_f$s over all the lattie points inside the cluster.\nThe

RbCl-RbBr and KBr-KI clusters.\nIt is obvious that $E_f$ for all kind of AH clusters decreases\nremarkably with decreasing size \\cite{Niiyama2011SASMLett}.\nThus the diffusion by vacancies is further\nenhanced as the size decreases.\nThis is the origin of the size-dependence of activation\nenergy and it is an underlying reason why the Vacancy \nMechanism effectively accelerates the SM in a smaller cluster.\nIt is expected that this size-dependence results from\nthe Coulomb long range force interacting between ions in {{AH}} clusters.\nMore details for the origin of the size-dependence of vacancy \nformation energy will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\section{{Conclusion}}}\n\n\n\n\n\nRapid diffusion in AH nano clusters,\nso-called {\\em Spontaneous Mixing},\nand its atomistic mechanism were investigated \nby Molecular Dynamics simulations employing a three dimensional\nmodel for ternary alkali halides: KCl-KBr, NaCl-NaBr, RbCl-RbBr and KBr-KI. \n\nTo quantify the atomistic mixing process \nwe introduced an indicator, ${R_g}$, which is a good indicator of\nthe degree of intermixing in a cubic shape cluster.\nApplying this indicator to the time evolutions of \n{(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}\nand observing their snapshots, \nwe confirmed that the SM is surely reproduced in our model clusters.\nOn the other hand, by computing Lindemann's\nindex, which measures the relative fluctuation\nof the distance between any two atoms,\nwe proved that the intermixing process proceeds in the solid phase.\nSimilar results were also\nobtained for AH clusters with different combination of species\nsuch as {(NaCl)$_{14}$(NaBr)$_{47}$}, {(RbCl)$_{14}$(RbBr)$_{47}$} and {(KBr)$_{14}$(KI)$_{47}$}.\n\n\nThe analysis of MD simulations at $600$-$900$ K indicated the \nArrhenius type temperature-dependence of the time required\nfor the intermixing.\nBy fitting with Arrhenius law, we also estimated \nthe activation energy: $E_{act} = 0.98, 1.1$ and $1.4$ eV\nfor {(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}, respectively.\nIt was also confirmed that\nthe activation energy as well as \nthe intermixing time depend on the size of the clusters.\n\nTo clarify the atomistic mechanism of the diffusion,\nwe scrutinized surface melting \nand the dynamics of ions inside the AH clusters during the intermixing.\nA detailed evaluation of individual Lindemann's index $\\delta_i$\nreveals a very important fact: in contrast to the metal nano clusters \nthe surface melting, which is the necessary condition \nfor Surface Peeling Mechanism, was not observed at all in {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$}.\nAt the same time, we observed that the time evolutions of radial \ndistance ${r_i^c}$ of inner ions together with the snapshots of \nthe position of all ions projected onto three planes also \ndo not show any indication of collective motions peculiar to the {{Surface Peeling Mechanism}}.\nAll the examples studied in our simulations \nindicate individual diffusive motions \nrather than collective motions dominate the mixing process.\nBy visualizing the trajectories of ions \nwe found the {{Vacancy Mechanism}} is responsible for the intermixing in AH clusters.\n\nThe rough estimation of the diffusion rate $D$ of the intermixing\nin {(KCl)$_{14}$(KBr)$_{47}$}, {(KCl)$_{62}$(KBr)$_{108}$} and {(KCl)$_{172}$(KBr)$_{191}$} at $700$ K\ngave $D= 3.1 \\times 10^{-14}$, $1.4 \\times 10^{-14}$, \nand $8.6 \\times 10^{-16}$ m$^2/$s.\nThese rates are much larger than the diffusion constant\nof bulk alkali halide crystals $\\sim 4 \\times 10^{-19}$ m$^2/$s. \nThese facts support the conclusion \nthat the intermixing observed in our MDs is \nrapid diffusion peculiar to nano particles.\n\n\nFinally, evaluation of vacancy formation energy $E_f$ for \nAH clusters with different species and sizes showed that \n$E_f$ definitely decreases as the size of the clusters becomes small, \nwhich is consistent with the size dependence of activation energy.\nThis decrease of vacancy formation energy with size is the principal\norigin of the rapidness of {{SM}} in AH clusters.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThe authors thank M.
