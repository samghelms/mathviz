The corresponding results are\npresented in Online Table \\ref{data} and Figs. \\ref{VRI} and \\ref{colours_VRI}. The errors quoted here are representative of the differential photometry process, and do not include the uncertainty in the\nabsolute calibration of the comparison stars ($\\sim 0.02$ mag).\nMain flaring events in Fig. \\ref{VRI} are labelled from 1 to 6 for later discussion.\n \n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=9.3cm]{VRI_20150626.eps}\n

\n  \nThe light curves in Fig. \\ref{VRI} and \\ref{colours_VRI} clearly show how \\object{V404 Cygni} varied and flared intensively\nduring the observation. The amplitude of variation was as large as one magnitude and several tenths of a magnitude\n in brightness and colour, respectively. These variations occurred \non timescales as short as 10 minutes. \nThe significance and intrinsic origin\nof these flares is ensured given that the comparison stars\nremained practically flat within a few hundreds of a magnitude.\nThis agrees well with the behaviour reported by different observers at other times\nduring the intensive coverage of the outburst   \\citep[e.g.][]{2015ATel.7677....1H}.\nFrom causality arguments, our data puts a coarse upper limit of $\\sim 1$ AU to the region from where the optical emission arises in the vicinity\nof the accretion disk around the \\object{V404 Cygni} black hole.\n\n\n\n\nIt is also very interesting that\nthe observed variability apparently followed a clear pattern in colour-colour diagrams.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. \\ref{colourevol} where the pattern becomes more evident as the source evolved in a very restricted\nregion of the diagram. A simple regression fit yields a correlation coefficient as high as 0.89, thus suggesting that a strong connection between the source colours existed during the flaring events.\nThe modelling of such behaviour is beyond the observational scope of this paper, and we limit ourselves here\nto state this observational fact. Nevertheless, we speculate that it could be intimately linked to\nthe source spectral evolution discussed below.\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=8.3cm]{VRvsVI_20150626.eps}\n      \\caption{Evolution of \\object{V404 Cygni} in the colour-colour plane during a few hours on 26 June 2015 as observer with the UJT.\n      The dotted line is a linear regression fit guiding the eye to better appreciate the colour-colour correlation suggested in the text.\n    }\n         \\label{colourevol}\n   \\end{figure} \n\n \n \n \n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=9.0cm]{VRI_dered_20150626.eps}\n      \\caption{Dereddened light curves of \\object{V404 Cygni} in outburst as observed with the UJT on 26 June 2015  in the $V$, $R_c$ and $I_c$ bands\n      assuming an interstellar extinction of $A_V=4.0$ mag.

The interstellar extinction law in  \\citet{2000asqu.book.....C} was used for de-reddening purposes.\nThis is presented in Fig. \\ref{VRIdered}, where two isolated flares (\\#3 and \\#4) are easily visible with their peaks separated by nearly a half hour. \nOther flaring events  both at the beginning  (\\#1 and \\#2) and the end (\\#5 and \\#6) of the observation are also present\nwithin comparable time intervals. However, their individual evolution\ncannot be so easily disentangled because they are close in time or not well sampled.\n\n\nBy analogy with other similar flaring behaviours,\n such as in the LMXB \\object{GRS 1915+105} at radio and near-infrared wavelengths \\citep{1998A&A...330L...9M},\none is tempted to interpret\nthis recursive flare pattern as episodes of replenishment and\nemptying of the inner accretion disk. These kind of events \ncome accompanied by the ejection of plasmons along collimated jets as a result of accretion disk instabilities.\nThese plasma clouds typically have a\ncharacteristic non-thermal, synchrotron\nemission mechanism. Their spectrum spans from radio to much shorter wavelengths depending on the energy cut-off of relativistic electrons and the strength of magnetic field.\nThe fact that strong radio emission from \\object{V404 Cygni} was detected  in 1.4 GHz observations carried out just six hours before ours, peaking at $0.364 \\pm 0.030$ Jy\n\\citep{2015ATel.7733....1T}, would be naturally understood in this context.\nThe similarity between \\object{V404 Cygni} and \\object{GRS 1915+105} has already been noted by \\citet{2015ATel.7658....1M}.\n\nThe observed optical flares appeared superimposed onto an average pedestal emission level likely due to hot \n accretion disk in \\object{V404 Cygni}. From Fig. \\ref{VRIdered}, the \naverage de-reddened flux densities were found to be\n$2.27 \\pm 0.16$, $2.02 \\pm 0.11$, and $1.10\\pm 0.04$ Jy in the $V$, $R_c$ and $I_c$ bands, respectively. By fitting a simple power law,\nthe average spectral energy distribution (SED) of \\object{V404 Cygni} \ndepends on frequency roughly as $\\propto \\nu^{2.1\\pm0.3}$. No correction for the contribution of the H$\\alpha$ emission line\nto $R_c$-band data has been attempted here.\nThe resulting power law index is consistent with the UJT data sampling the Raleigh Jeans $\\nu^2$ part of the accretion disk spectrum.\nExtrapolation of this power law to the radio band falls orders of magnitude below the reported radio flux densities. \nTherefore, an additional emission component must exist to explain the \\citet{2015ATel.7733....1T} radio detection.\nAs stated before, this component is most naturally interpreted as originating in plasma ejection events. \n \n\n\n\n\nIn the scenario outlined here, one would expect the peak time of an individual flare to be dependent on the wavelength of observation.\nAccording to the simple \\citet{1966Natur.211.1131L} model of a synchrotron-emitting expanding plasmon, the light curve observed\nat a  wavelength $\\lambda$ reaches its maximum after a time given by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 7101, "prevtext": " \n\n\n   \\title{Multi-colour optical photometry of \\object{V404 Cygni} in outburst}\n\n   \\subtitle{}\n\n   \\author{Josep Mart\\'{\\i}\n          \\inst{1}\n          \\and\n          Pedro L.

Intensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of this historical event\nyielded an orbital period of about 6.5 d and remarkably concluded with the presence of a massive stellar black hole in the system\n\\citep{1992Natur.355..614C,1992ApJ...401L..97W}. The companion star of \\object{V404 Cygni} has been proposed to be  an object of a late-type\nK0($\\pm$1) III-V spectral type\n\n \\citep{1993MNRAS.265..834C}.\nRadio detections using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)  enabled an accurate parallax measurement that places \\object{V404 Cygni}\nat a distance of $2.39 \\pm 0.14$ kpc \\citep{2009ApJ...706L.230M}. These VLBI observations also constrained the size of any quiescent jets to less than 1.4 AU.\nThe quiescent X-ray spectrum has a power-law photon index $\\Gamma \\simeq 2.0$ seen through a \na total column density of $N_H = (1.0 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ (see e.g. \\citet{2014MNRAS.441.3656R} and references therein).\nThe unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV  luminosity approaches several times $10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$, thus making \\object{V404 Cygni} the brightest black hole LMXB in quiescence.\n\nOn 16 June 2015, \\object{V404 Cygni} was reported to be in outburst by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope  \\citep{GCN_circ}, and soon confirmed by the\nMonitor of All-sky X-ray Image on board the International Space Station \\citep{2015ATel.7646....1N}.\nAfter these early warnings, an intensive observational effort was deployed by many observers that was quickly reflected in an intense\nflow of tens of related electronic telegrams. Soon, it became evident that this was an extraordinary outburst event after decades of quiescence.\nOptical, infrared, radio, X-ray and gamma-ray telescopes have so far collected an impressive amount of data that will emerge in the scientific literature\nin the upcoming months. But the extraordinary thing was that even small optical telescopes could join this endeavor since \\object{V404 Cygni}\nbecame a bright and highly variable source at visible wavelengths \\citep{2015ATel.7677....1H, 2015ATel.7681....1H, 2015ATel.7688....1W, 2015ATel.7721....1S}.\n\nIn this work, we present the optical data acquired using the educational astronomical facilities available \nat the University of Ja\\'en (UJA). Our aim is to contribute to the wealth of public astronomical data about this transient event while, at the same time, attempting\nto better constrain the nature of this phenomenon.\n\n\n\\section{Observations}\n\nThe observations were carried out on  26 June 2015 from the UJA Astronomical Observatory. The observatory is located\nin an urban area inside the Campus of Las Lagunillas, and hosts an automated 41 cm Schmidt-Cassgrain with f/8 focal ratio. \nThe UJA telescope, heareafter UJT, operates using a ST10-XME commercial CCD camera with $2184 \\times 1472$ pixels of 6.8 $\\mu$m size. The pixel scale is 0{${\\rlap.}^{\\prime \\prime}$} 42 pixel$^{-1}$.\nThe camera is  equipped with a wheel of $UBVR_cI_c$ Johnson-Cousins filters \\citep{1953ApJ...117..313J,  1974MNRAS.166..711C, 1974MNSSA..33..149C} manufactured \naccording to the Bessell filter prescription \\citep{1979PASP...91..589B}. The seeing average was typically of about $2^{\\prime\\prime}$, and therefore $2\\times2$ binning was used.\n \nDifferential $VR_cI_c$ photometry was performed on \\object{V404 Cygni} during 3 h\nwith exposure times of 60 s in each filter. The total number of measurements acquired per filter was $N_{\\rm obs} = 51$. Four \ncomparison stars in the field were used\nwhose photometric behaviour, within 0.01-0.02 mag,  was found to be very stable in all bands. Their \n$VR_c I_c$ magnitudes were retrieved from the AAVSO database\\footnote{American Association of Variable Stars Observers, http://www.aavso.org\n and references therein.},\nand are given in Online Table \\ref{comparisons}. Photometry in $U$ and $B$ bands was not acquired because of very low source counts.\nFor each observed photometric band, here generically indicated by an effective wavelength $\\lambda$, the magnitudes of the variable target $m^{\\rm var}_{\\lambda}$\n were derived with respect to the comparison stars according to:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nm^{\\rm var}_{\\lambda} = m^{\\rm com}_{\\lambda} + \\Delta m_{\\lambda, {\\rm ins}} + T_{\\lambda, C_{\\lambda}} \\Delta C_{\\lambda, {\\rm ins}}, \\\\  \\label{trans}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"m^{\\rm var}_{\\lambda}=m^{\\rm com}_{\\lambda}+\\Delta m_{\\lambda,{\\rm ins}}+T_{%&#10;\\lambda,C_{\\lambda}}\\Delta C_{\\lambda,{\\rm ins}},\\\\&#10;\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>var</mi></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>m</mi><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>com</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>m</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>ins</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mi>\u03bb</mi></msub></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>C</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>ins</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01941.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $t_{m,\\lambda_0}$ is the time of maximum at a reference wavelength $\\lambda_0$, and $p$ is the power-law index of the energy distribution\nof relativistic electrons. \n\nIn the absence of contemporaneous high time resolution radio photometry, where a $\\lambda$-dependent delay  would be easier to measure, \nwe searched our optical data for possible time lags between the different light curves at $V$, $R_c$ and $I_c$ bands.\nTaking, for instance, the isolated flare \\#3, \nwhich peaks around MJD 57199.965 in Figs. \\ref{VRI} and \\ref{VRIdered}, the rising time from the pedestal emission level\nto the flare peak in the $V$-band is $t_{m,V} \\simeq 0.01$ d. \nAssuming $p\\simeq 1.0$, and given that the central effective wavelengths of our photometric filer set \n($\\lambda_V =0.545$ $\\mu$m, $\\lambda_{R_c}=0.641$ $\\mu$m, and $\\lambda_{I_c}=0.798$ $\\mu$m), we can estimate the expected time delays\nin the UJT observations. Using Eq. \\ref{delays}, and taking the $V$ band as reference, the predicted delays are 1.2 min and 3.0 min for the $R_c$ and $I_c$ band, respectively.\nSimilarly, a 1.8 min delay would be expected between $I_c$ and $R_c$ data. Assuming other reasonable values of $p$ \ndoes not change significantly\nthese numbers. For instance, taking $p=2.5$ one gets delays of 1.0 min, 2.4 min, and 1.4 min, respectively.\n \n  \n\n What happens with real data? \n To answer this question, we performed a  cross-correlation function (CCF) exercise between the different UJT light curves.\n A problem arises here because the data are not evenly spaced in time.\n The CCF calculation  was then  carried out in two different ways. The first calculation was specially designed for such irregular time series and is based on averaging\ndata products with similar time lags within a user defined binning \\citep{1988ApJ...333..646E}. The second calculation simply makes a linear\ninterpolation to obtain a regular sampling of the data from which the traditional estimator of the CCF is computed. In our case, this second\napproach is justified because our observations were nearly evenly spaced.\nWhen applying the first method, the resulting CCFs do not have enough resolution to clearly establish a non-zero time lag although hints \nof delay between the longer and shorter wavelength filters were obtained.\nIn contrast, the interpolation method provided well-defined CCF maxima shifted from zero (Online Figs. \\ref{correlos_a} and \\ref{correlos_b}).\n\n\n\n\nHere, the key fact is that all maxima occur with a clearly negative lag, i.e. consistent with the longer wavelength light curves\nthat are delayed with respect to the shorter wavelength curves, as expected. Interestingly, similar negative time lags have also been observed in some of the \\object{V404 Cygni} \nflares seen by the {\\it INTEGRAL} satellite \\citep{2015A&A...581L...9R}, where the optical $V$-band emission was delayed with respect  to hard X-rays and soft $\\gamma$-rays\nfrom 1.5 to 20-30 min. However, these lags correspond to extremely different energy bands in contrast to our\nresults here reported within the optical domain.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe measured offset of the maxima with respect to the origin  (in Online Figs. \\ref{correlos_a} and \\ref{correlos_b})\nindicates that the $I_c$ band light curve is delayed with respect to $V$ band \nby $108 \\pm 1$ s, while the $R_c$ band lags it by $34\\pm1$ s.  \n\n\nConcerning the two reddest filters, $I_c$ band also lags the $R_c$ band by $34\\pm1$ s.\nThe uncertainties in the estimates of the CCF peak positions were derived using the \\citet{1994PASP..106..879W} formula\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 23462, "prevtext": "\nwhere $ m^{\\rm com}_{\\lambda}$ is the  magnitude of the comparison star being used, and\n$\\Delta m_{\\lambda, {\\rm ins}}$ \nand\n$\\Delta C_{\\lambda, {\\rm ins}}$ \nare the instrumental differences in magnitude and colour between the target and comparison star, respectively. \nThe factor $T_{\\lambda, C_{\\lambda}}$ is the colour transformation coefficient that was separately determined using standards in clusters and other fields.\n\nThe colour $(V-R_c)$ was used in Eq. \\ref{trans} for $V$- and $R_c$-band observations, while the colour $(V-I_c)$ was preferred for $I_c$-band observations instead.\nThe system photometric properties are approximately stable from night to night and we typically obtain $|T_{\\lambda, C_{\\lambda}}| <  0.1$.\nFinally, the different measurements of $m^{\\rm var}_{\\lambda}$ were weighted according to their respective uncertainty and then averaged. The corresponding results are\npresented in Online Table \\ref{data} and Figs. \\ref{VRI} and \\ref{colours_VRI}. The errors quoted here are representative of the differential photometry process, and do not include the uncertainty in the\nabsolute calibration of the comparison stars ($\\sim 0.02$ mag).\nMain

\n  \nThe light curves in Fig. \\ref{VRI} and \\ref{colours_VRI} clearly show how \\object{V404 Cygni} varied and flared intensively\nduring the observation. The amplitude of variation was as large as one magnitude and several tenths of a magnitude\n in brightness and colour, respectively. These variations occurred \non timescales as short as 10 minutes. \nThe significance and intrinsic origin\nof these flares is ensured given that the comparison stars\nremained practically flat within a few hundreds of a magnitude.\nThis agrees well with the behaviour reported by different observers at other times\nduring the intensive coverage of the outburst   \\citep[e.g.][]{2015ATel.7677....1H}.\nFrom causality arguments, our data puts a coarse upper limit of $\\sim 1$ AU to the region from where the optical emission arises in the vicinity\nof the accretion disk around the \\object{V404 Cygni} black hole.\n\n\n\n\nIt is also very interesting that\nthe observed variability apparently followed a clear pattern in colour-colour diagrams.\nThis is illustrated in Fig. \\ref{colourevol} where the pattern becomes more evident as the source evolved in a very restricted\nregion of the diagram. A simple regression fit yields a correlation coefficient as high as 0.89, thus suggesting that a strong connection between the source colours existed during the flaring events.\nThe modelling of such behaviour is beyond the observational scope of this paper, and we limit ourselves here\nto state this observational fact. Nevertheless, we speculate that it could be intimately linked to\nthe source spectral evolution discussed below.\n\n\n\n \\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=8.3cm]{VRvsVI_20150626.eps}\n      \\caption{Evolution of \\object{V404 Cygni} in the colour-colour plane during a few hours on 26 June 2015 as observer with the UJT.\n      The dotted line is a linear regression fit guiding the eye to better appreciate the colour-colour correlation suggested in the text.\n    }\n         \\label{colourevol}\n   \\end{figure} \n\n \n \n \n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=9.0cm]{VRI_dered_20150626.eps}\n      \\caption{Dereddened light curves of \\object{V404 Cygni} in outburst as observed with the UJT on 26 June 2015  in the $V$, $R_c$ and $I_c$ bands\n      assuming an interstellar extinction of $A_V=4.0$ mag. The brightness level has been converted from magnitudes to a flux density scale, in mJy units.\n      Flares are labelled as in Fig. \\ref{VRI}.\n    }\n         \\label{VRIdered}\n   \\end{figure} \n  \n\n\nThe intrinsic amplitudes of the observed flares become more obvious when de-reddening the photometric observations, \nand expressing them in terms of flux density. The interstellar extinction law in  \\citet{2000asqu.book.....C} was used for de-reddening purposes.\nThis is presented in Fig. \\ref{VRIdered}, where two isolated flares (\\#3 and \\#4) are easily visible with their peaks separated by nearly a half hour. \nOther flaring events  both at the beginning  (\\#1 and \\#2) and the end (\\#5 and \\#6) of the observation are also present\nwithin comparable time intervals. However, their individual evolution\ncannot be so easily disentangled because they are close in time or not well sampled.\n\n\nBy analogy with other similar flaring behaviours,\n such as in the LMXB \\object{GRS 1915+105} at radio and near-infrared wavelengths \\citep{1998A&A...330L...9M},\none is tempted to interpret\nthis recursive flare pattern as episodes of replenishment and\nemptying of the inner accretion disk. These kind of events \ncome accompanied by the ejection of plasmons along collimated jets as a result of accretion disk instabilities.\nThese plasma clouds typically have a\ncharacteristic non-thermal, synchrotron\nemission mechanism. Their spectrum spans from radio to much shorter wavelengths depending on the energy cut-off of relativistic electrons and the strength of magnetic field.\nThe fact that strong radio emission from \\object{V404 Cygni} was detected  in 1.4 GHz observations carried out just six hours before ours, peaking at $0.364 \\pm 0.030$ Jy\n\\citep{2015ATel.7733....1T}, would be naturally understood in this context.\nThe similarity between \\object{V404 Cygni} and \\object{GRS 1915+105} has already been noted by \\citet{2015ATel.7658....1M}.\n\nThe observed optical flares appeared superimposed onto an average pedestal emission level likely due to hot \n accretion disk in \\object{V404 Cygni}. From Fig. \\ref{VRIdered}, the \naverage de-reddened flux densities were found to be\n$2.27 \\pm 0.16$, $2.02 \\pm 0.11$, and $1.10\\pm 0.04$ Jy in the $V$, $R_c$ and $I_c$ bands, respectively. By fitting a simple power law,\nthe average spectral energy distribution (SED) of \\object{V404 Cygni} \ndepends on frequency roughly as $\\propto \\nu^{2.1\\pm0.3}$. No correction for the contribution of the H$\\alpha$ emission line\nto $R_c$-band data has been attempted here.\nThe resulting power law index is consistent with the UJT data sampling the Raleigh Jeans $\\nu^2$ part of the accretion disk spectrum.\nExtrapolation of this power law to the radio band falls orders of magnitude below the reported radio flux densities. \nTherefore, an additional emission component must exist to explain the \\citet{2015ATel.7733....1T} radio detection.\nAs stated before, this component is most naturally interpreted as originating in plasma ejection events. \n \n\n\n\n\nIn the scenario outlined here, one would expect the peak time of an individual flare to be dependent on the wavelength of observation.\nAccording to the simple \\citet{1966Natur.211.1131L} model of a synchrotron-emitting expanding plasmon, the light curve observed\nat a  wavelength $\\lambda$ reaches its maximum after a time given by\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nt_{m,\\lambda} = t_{m,\\lambda_0} [\\lambda / \\lambda_0]^{-\\frac{p+4}{4p+6}},  \\label{delays}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"t_{m,\\lambda}=t_{m,\\lambda_{0}}[\\lambda/\\lambda_{0}]^{-\\frac{p+4}{4p+6}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01941.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $W_{\\rm CCF}$ is the full width at half maximum of the CCF peak with $r_{\\rm max}$ amplitude, and $N_{\\rm total}= (N_{\\rm obs}-1) N $ the full number\nof available points, where $N$ is the amount of sampling points.\n In our case, $W_{\\rm CCF} \\simeq 1000$ s, $r_{\\rm max}\\simeq 1$, \nand we interpolated up to $N=10^4$ points.\n \n\nAlthough these numbers are not identical to the values anti\\-cipated using Eq. \\ref{delays}, \nall of them appear to be in the expected sense and with the expected order of magnitude.\n\nSuch agreement is remarkable given the simplicity of the Van der Laan model and the limitation of our data.\n\nIn order to assess the robustness of our finding, we performed a sensitivity analysis of how interpolated sampling affects the results.\nAs seen in Online Fig. \\ref{correlos_c}, the derived lags always reach a constant level after a sufficiently large number of interpolated points.\nComputing the rms dispersion of the latest 1000 points provides values of  $\\sim1$ s comparable to the uncertainty estimates\nderived with Eq. \\ref{ccf_error}. Online Fig. \\ref{correlos_c} also shows that, even with coarse interpolation, the $V$ vs $I_c$ time lag  still \nremains significant although at a lower level. \nThe $V$ vs $I_c$ time lag amounts to $86 \\pm 16$ s for $N=10$ interpolated sampling points. The other filter combinations,\n $V$ vs $R_c$ and $R$ vs $I_c$, which are closer in wavelength,  remain consistent with zero both amounting to $22\\pm 16$ s.\n\n\nMoreover, to further ensure the confidence on the lag estimates with interpolated light curves,\n\nwe conducted a series of simulations by cross-correlating the observed light curves with themselves\nafter introducing different artificial time lags (see Online Table \\ref{artificial_lag}).\n Our procedure was able to confidently recover these time lags, within a few seconds, but always with a systematic negative bias that\n results as an intrinsic effect of the interpolation method used. In our case this is not expected to introduce \n a severe effect because of the lack of skewness in the time sampling distribution \\citep{npg-18-389-2011}.\n Therefore, the measured lag values quoted\n above should be actually interpreted as lower limits.\n  These two consistency checks reinforce our\nconfidence in the lag detection provided that interpolation is actually a good approximation.\n\n\nAnother test that could be performed is the dependence of the maximum flux densities $S_{m, \\lambda}$ as a function of wavelength.\nFollowing \\citet{1966Natur.211.1131L}, the expected dependence is:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 27143, "prevtext": "\nwhere $t_{m,\\lambda_0}$ is the time of maximum at a reference wavelength $\\lambda_0$, and $p$ is the power-law index of the energy distribution\nof relativistic electrons. \n\nIn the absence of contemporaneous high time resolution radio photometry, where a $\\lambda$-dependent delay  would be easier to measure, \nwe searched our optical data for possible time lags between the different light curves at $V$, $R_c$ and $I_c$ bands.\nTaking, for instance, the isolated flare \\#3, \nwhich peaks around MJD 57199.965 in Figs. \\ref{VRI} and \\ref{VRIdered}, the rising time from the pedestal emission level\nto the flare peak in the $V$-band is $t_{m,V} \\simeq 0.01$ d. \nAssuming $p\\simeq 1.0$, and given that the central effective wavelengths of our photometric filer set \n($\\lambda_V =0.545$ $\\mu$m, $\\lambda_{R_c}=0.641$ $\\mu$m, and $\\lambda_{I_c}=0.798$ $\\mu$m), we can estimate the expected time delays\nin the UJT observations. Using Eq. \\ref{delays}, and taking the $V$ band as reference, the predicted delays are 1.2 min and 3.0 min for the $R_c$ and $I_c$ band, respectively.\nSimilarly, a 1.8 min delay would be expected between $I_c$ and $R_c$ data. Assuming other reasonable values of $p$ \ndoes not change significantly\nthese numbers. For instance, taking $p=2.5$ one gets delays of 1.0 min, 2.4 min, and 1.4 min, respectively.\n \n  \n\n What happens with real data? \n To answer this question, we performed a  cross-correlation function (CCF) exercise between the different UJT light curves.\n A problem arises here because the data are not evenly spaced in time.\n The CCF calculation  was then  carried out in two different ways. The first calculation was specially designed for such irregular time series and is based on averaging\ndata products with similar time lags within a user defined binning \\citep{1988ApJ...333..646E}. The second calculation simply makes a linear\ninterpolation to obtain a regular sampling of the data from which the traditional estimator of the CCF is computed. In our case, this second\napproach is justified because our observations were nearly evenly spaced.\nWhen applying the first method, the resulting CCFs do not have enough resolution to clearly establish a non-zero time lag although hints \nof delay between the longer and shorter wavelength filters were obtained.\nIn contrast, the interpolation method provided well-defined CCF maxima shifted from zero (Online Figs. \\ref{correlos_a} and \\ref{correlos_b}).\n\n\n\n\nHere, the key fact is that all maxima occur with a clearly negative lag, i.e. consistent with the longer wavelength light curves\nthat are delayed with respect to the shorter wavelength curves, as expected. Interestingly, similar negative time lags have also been observed in some of the \\object{V404 Cygni} \nflares seen by the {\\it INTEGRAL} satellite \\citep{2015A&A...581L...9R}, where the optical $V$-band emission was delayed with respect  to hard X-rays and soft $\\gamma$-rays\nfrom 1.5 to 20-30 min. However, these lags correspond to extremely different energy bands in contrast to our\nresults here reported within the optical domain.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe measured offset of the maxima with respect to the origin  (in Online Figs. \\ref{correlos_a} and \\ref{correlos_b})\nindicates that the $I_c$ band light curve is delayed with respect to $V$ band \nby $108 \\pm 1$ s, while the $R_c$ band lags it by $34\\pm1$ s.  \n\n\nConcerning the two reddest filters, $I_c$ band also lags the $R_c$ band by $34\\pm1$ s.\nThe uncertainties in the estimates of the CCF peak positions were derived using the \\citet{1994PASP..106..879W} formula\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta \\tau = \\frac{0.38 W_{\\rm CCF}}{1+r_{\\rm max} (N_{\\rm total}-2)^{1/2}},  \\label{ccf_error}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta\\tau=\\frac{0.38W_{\\rm CCF}}{1+r_{\\rm max}(N_{\\rm total}-2)^{1/2}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>0.38</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>W</mi><mi>CCF</mi></msub></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>max</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>total</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01941.tex", "nexttext": "\nConsidering the same isolated flare as above, and removing the pedestal flux density with a simple linear fit, we estimate the \n\n$V$-band maximum\nas $S_{m,V} \\simeq 1480$ mJy.

This agrees with the idea, already expressed before, that the optical light curve of \\object{V404 Cygni} \nin outburst during our observation consists of the\nsuperposition of  flares that appear every half hour on average. \n\nFlaring behaviour with a similar timescale is also present in\noptical light curves reported by other observers just  before and after\nour UJT observations  \\citep{2015ATel.7721....1S, 2015ATel.7737....1S}.\n\n  \n\n\nThe energy involved in each ejection event can also be derived based on simple equipartition arguments using the \\citet{pacholczyk1970radio} formulation.\nLooking at Fig. \\ref{VRIdered}, \n the  flare incremental flux density  with respect to the pedestal value is in the range $\\sim 0.5$-1.0 Jy, and this occurs typically \n $\\sim 10^3$ s after the estimated onset of the flares.\nSuch flux density increments are comparable to the 1.4 GHz emission levels  reported near the time of\nour observations within a factor of a few. This renders the possibility of a nearly flat synchrotron component from radio to optical wavelengths conceivable.\nAssuming an expansion velocity of $\\sim 0.5c$, the plasmon size at the time of maximum would be $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{13}$ cm.\nThis is  equivalent to 0.4 milli-arcsec\nat the \\object{V404 Cygni} distance and consistent with previous size upper limits. \nUsing this dimension, the radio/optical flux densities quoted before, and assuming relativistic electrons with Lorentz\nfactor $\\gamma \\leq 10^4$, the total energy content is estimated to be $2\\times 10^{40}$ erg, with a magnetic field of 12 G. The source brightness\ntemperature does not exceed a few  $10^{12}$ K. Under all such assumptions,\nthe corresponding non-thermal luminosity, from the radio to optical domain, amounts to $2.2 \\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which implies a synchrotron life-time\nof about 2 h for individual flaring events. This is only four times their observed recurrence interval, thus flare superposition should become negligible after a few flaring events.\nFinally, the plasmon mass involved in the ejection is found to be $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{20}$ g provided that there is one proton per relativistic electron.\nThese numbers do not differ by more than one order of magnitude when compared with the reference case of \\object{GRS 1915+105}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have reported new optical photometric data for the LMXB \\object{V404 Cygni} during its 2015 June  outburst obtained with a small educational telescope. The time interval\ncovered by our observations complements and contributes to the multi-wavelength campaign carried out  as a world-wide effort by many observers.\nFrom the analysis of our data alone, some interesting findings can already be advanced and we summarize them as follows.\n\n\n\nThe UJT optical light curves  consisted of consecutive and partially overlapping  flaring events,  appearing about every half hour and\nwith very large amplitudes  ($\\sim 1$ mag).\nTimescales of  variability as short as 10 minutes could be clearly detected both in brightness and colour.\nThe optical variability observed appears to display a correlation pattern in the colour-colour plane, \nwhose interpretation will deserve future\ntheoretical work.\n\nThe de-reddened optical continuum had an average positive spectral index close the $+2$ value. \nThus, for  most of the time\nthe observed photometric bands  ($VR_cI_c$) were mainly sampling the Rayleigh Jeans part of the accretion disk spectrum.\nThe \\object{V404 Cygni} flares, superposed on this continuum, are tentatively interpreted as non-thermal flaring events.\nWith all caution, we suggest that the flares are due to \nrelativistic plasmons ejected following successive replenishing and emptying episodes of the inner accretion disk.\nThe fact that non-thermal, synchrotron emission appears to contribute to optical wavelengths renders \\object{V404 Cygni} a very interesting system\nto better study the energetics of black hole LMXBs.\n\n\n\nFrom a CCF analysis, we have found a systematic time lag between the UJT optical light curves acquired with the different  filters during our observations.\nThese lags are such that emission at  shorter wavelengths precedes emission at longer wavelengths by $\\sim 1$ min.\nThis finding was most evident when light curves were resampled and evenly interpolated, which we believe is a reasonable approach \nwhen dealing with nearly evenly spaced data.\nThis delay is in qualitative agreement with a simple Van der Laan model for the expansion of a synchrotron emitting plasmon,  \nand the relative amplitude of flare maxima is also consistent.\nAn estimate of the plasmon physical parameters required for the non-thermal spectrum to extend from radio to optical wavelengths \nappears to be similar to other well-known systems, such as \\object{GRS 1915+105}.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\n    This work was supported by grant AYA2013-47447-C3-3-P from the Spanish Ministerio de Econom\\'{\\i}a y Competitividad (MINECO),\nand by the Consejer\\'{\\i}a de Econom\\'{\\i}a, Innovaci\\'on, Ciencia y Empleo of Junta de Andaluc\\'{\\i}a\n\nunder research group FQM-322, as well as FEDER funds.  \n    \n\\end{acknowledgements}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{aa} \n\\bibliography{references} \n     \n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 29829, "prevtext": "\nwhere $W_{\\rm CCF}$ is the full width at half maximum of the CCF peak with $r_{\\rm max}$ amplitude, and $N_{\\rm total}= (N_{\\rm obs}-1) N $ the full number\nof available points, where $N$ is the amount of sampling points.\n In our case, $W_{\\rm CCF} \\simeq 1000$ s, $r_{\\rm max}\\simeq 1$, \nand we interpolated up to $N=10^4$ points.\n \n\nAlthough these numbers are not identical to the values anti\\-cipated using Eq. \\ref{delays}, \nall of them appear to be in the expected sense and with the expected order of magnitude.\n\nSuch agreement is remarkable given the simplicity of the Van der Laan model and the limitation of our data.\n\nIn order to assess the robustness of our finding, we performed a sensitivity analysis of how interpolated sampling affects the results.\nAs seen in Online Fig. \\ref{correlos_c}, the derived lags always reach a constant level after a sufficiently large number of interpolated points.\nComputing the rms dispersion of the latest 1000 points provides values of  $\\sim1$ s comparable to the uncertainty estimates\nderived with Eq. \\ref{ccf_error}. Online Fig. \\ref{correlos_c} also shows that, even with coarse interpolation, the $V$ vs $I_c$ time lag  still \nremains significant although at a lower level. \nThe $V$ vs $I_c$ time lag amounts to $86 \\pm 16$ s for $N=10$ interpolated sampling points. The other filter combinations,\n $V$ vs $R_c$ and $R$ vs $I_c$, which are closer in wavelength,  remain consistent with zero both amounting to $22\\pm 16$ s.\n\n\nMoreover, to further ensure the confidence on the lag estimates with interpolated light curves,\n\nwe conducted a series of simulations by cross-correlating the observed light curves with themselves\nafter introducing different artificial time lags (see Online Table \\ref{artificial_lag}).\n Our procedure was able to confidently recover these time lags, within a few seconds, but always with a systematic negative bias that\n results as an intrinsic effect of the interpolation method used. In our case this is not expected to introduce \n a severe effect because of the lack of skewness in the time sampling distribution \\citep{npg-18-389-2011}.\n Therefore, the measured lag values quoted\n above should be actually interpreted as lower limits.\n  These two consistency checks reinforce our\nconfidence in the lag detection provided that interpolation is actually a good approximation.\n\n\nAnother test that could be performed is the dependence of the maximum flux densities $S_{m, \\lambda}$ as a function of wavelength.\nFollowing \\citet{1966Natur.211.1131L}, the expected dependence is:\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nS_{m,\\lambda} = S_{m,\\lambda_0} [\\lambda / \\lambda_0]^{-\\frac{7p+3}{4p+6}},  \\label{ratios}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S_{m,\\lambda}=S_{m,\\lambda_{0}}[\\lambda/\\lambda_{0}]^{-\\frac{7p+3}{4p+6}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mn>7</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
