observational efforts to understand galaxy evolution\nhave been focused on determining the history of cosmic star formation, \ngas density evolution, metallicity evolution\nand mass growth of the Universe \\citep{daddi04,mannucci10,madau14,tomczak14,bouwens15}.\nThese multiwavelength observational constraints \nhave been usually summarized as galaxy scaling relations \nthat might change or not with redshift \\citep{mannucci10,elbaz11,bouwens14,troncoso14},\nin high or low density environments, in extreme physical conditions (starburst, AGN galaxies),\nand in spatially resolved data due to internal variations of the galaxy properties \\citep{sanchez13}.\nIn parallel, theoretical works and simulations\nhave tried to explain the physical mechanisms that reproduce the measured global properties\n\\citep{daddi10,dave11,lilly13,lagos14,padilla14}.\n\nDespite these efforts, \nthe completeness and cleanness of the sample\nare still challenging issues \nthat depend on the sample selection-method, instruments limit, and telescope time.\nThe aforementioned issues make the comparison \nbetween observational and theoretical works even more difficult.\n\nFor example, \\cite{campbell14} compared the stellar mass of GALFORM galaxies\npredicted by the model with the ones obtained via the fit of their predicted broad-band colors.\nThey find that, for an individual galaxy, both quantities differ, \nhence the clustering of mass-selected samples can be affected by systematic biases.\nTherefore, mass-selected samples might provide erroneous conclusions regarding their progenitors and descendants.\n\nBesides, the evolution of scaling relations is constrained with observations \nof galaxy samples, selected with luminosity or stellar-mass thresholds,\nlocated at different redshifts,\nwhich does not necessarily constitute causally connected populations\n(i.e. do not follow a progenitor-to-descendant relationship).\nClustering selected samples overcome this issue because,\nin a hierarchical clustering scenario,\na correlation analysis allows us to estimate the bias \nand hence statistically determine the progenitors and descendants of galaxy samples.\nThe bias parameter measures the clustering difference between the galaxy spatial distribution \nand underlying dark-matter distribution.\nThus, it relates the typical mass of haloes hosting the galaxies \\citep{sheth_mo_tormen01}.\nHence, measuring it in galaxy samples at different redshifts,\ndetermines whether we are following the evolution of baryonic processes occurring on haloes of similar masses or not.\nThis fact is of extreme importance because once it is determined\nwe can use the multiwavelength data to study the evolution \nof the baryonic processes at certain halo mass,\nestablishing a direct link between observations and galaxy formation models.\n\\cite{padilla10} selected early-type galaxies according to their clustering and \nluminosity function in the MUSYC survey.\nSo far, no study that selects star-forming galaxies according their clustering and luminosity function has been reported.\n\nStar-forming galaxies are of particular interest,\nbecause they allow us to study the mechanisms that switch on/off the star formation \nand its evolution with redshift.\nConsidering the lack of wide spectroscopic surveys,\nin the sense of wavelength coverage and surveyed area,\nthe majority of the star-forming galaxy samples \nhave been chosen using two-color selection techniques.\nThe so-called ``dropout'' technique is based on recording \nthe difference between two distinct parts of the spectrum,\nwhich generate a break on it (e.g. the 912\\AA~Lyman break, the 3646\\AA~Balmer jump).\nThis difference is strong enough that it has been measured in broad bands, \nselecting star-forming galaxies at early periods of the Universe ($z>1.4$), \n\nsuch as the BzK, BX, BM, DOGs and LBGs \\citep{steidel96,daddi04,steidel04,dey08,infante15}.\nSeveral authors have measured the bias \\citep{gawiser07,blanc08,guaita10}  determining the mass of the halo where each galaxy sample resides\nand connecting the progenitors and descendants of these galaxy samples.\nOther works selected the samples trusting\nfully on their photometric-redshift and\nthe physical properties determined via SED-fitting \\citep{tomczak14},\nfar-IR luminosity \\citep{rodighiero11}\nor Bayesian approaches such as {\\tt iSEDfit} \\citep{moustakas13}.\n\nRecently, \\cite{viironen15} implemented a method in the ALHAMBRA survey\nto select galaxy samples using\nthe probability distribution of the photometric redshift (zPDF).\nThe quality of the detailed SED distribution,\nprovided by the medium bands of the ALHAMBRA survey,\nallowed them to perform an accurate statistical analysis.\nIndeed, they include our lack of knowledge on the precise galaxy redshift and select the sample according to {\\it certain probability threshold} defined by the authors.\nTherefore, by definition this method selects a clean but not a {\\it complete} sample.\n\n\nIn this work, we aim to develop a technique,\n{\\it base purely on photometric data},\nto select star-forming galaxies.\nThis kind of selection allows us to directly compare with\nthe previously mentioned works that also use a dropout technique\nto select their BzK, LBG, etc. samples.\nWe use the uniform separation between two contiguous medium-bands\nof the ALHAMBRA survey to register the redshifted position of the \n3646\\AA~ Balmer jump within the optical domain, \nallowing us to select galaxy samples in the redshift range $0.5 < z < 2$. \n\n\nWe base our two-color selection technique on the \\cite{bc03} models\nand apply it to the GOLD ALHAMBRA catalogs \\citep{molino13}.\nIn the following, the galaxies selected by this method are dubbed \nBalmer jump Galaxies (BJGs) and their physical properties are investigated.\nBased on a clustering study, \nwe find the progenitors and descendants of galaxies in these samples,\nallowing us to study the evolution of the SED fit derived properties \nas a function of redshift on haloes of certain mass.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows:\nin section \\S\\ref{s_alh}, we summarize the ALHAMBRA observations and\nintroduce the nomenclature of the ALHAMBRA filter system used throughout the paper.\nIn section \\S\\ref{s_sample}, the selection method is described and attested with the \\cite{bc03} models.\nThe $BJG$ samples are defined here.\nIn section \\S\\ref{s_pp}, each galaxy SED is modeled using {\\tt iSEDfit} \\citep{moustakas13}\nand the physical properties of each sample are characterized as a whole.\nIn section \\S\\ref{s_clustering}, the clustering properties are calculated.\nIn section \\S\\ref{s_discussion}, the main results are discussed.\nFinally, in section \\S\\ref{s_conclusions} our conclusions are exposed.\nThroughout the paper, we use a standard flat cosmology\nwith $H_0=100

(ALHAMBRA\\footnote[1]{\\tt http://www.alhambrasurvey.com})\nsurvey provides a kind of {\\it cosmic tomography} for the evolution of \nthe contents of the Universe over most of the cosmic history. \n\\cite{benitez09} have especially designed a new optical photometric system for the ALHAMBRA survey,\nwhich maximizes the number of objects with an accurate classification by the\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED) and photometric redshift.\nIt employs 20 contiguous, equal-width $\\sim$ 310 \\AA, \nmedium-band covering the wavelength range from 3500 \\AA$\\,$ to 9700 \\AA,\nplus the standard $JHK$ near-infrared bands. \n\\cite{moles08}, and \\cite{apariciovillegas} presented an extensive description of the survey\nand filter transmission curves.\nThe observations were taken in the Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA, Spain)\nwith the 3.5-m telescope using \nthe two wide-field imagers in the optical (LAICA) and NIR (Omega-2000).\nThe total surveyed area is 2.8deg$^2$ distributed in eight fields that overlap areas \nof other surveys such as SDSS, COSMOS, DEEP-2, and HDF-N.\nThe typical seeing of the optical images is 1.1arcsec,\nwhile for the NIR images is 1.0arcsec.  \nFor details about the survey and data release, \nplease refer to \\cite{molino13}, and \\cite{ch09}.\nIn this work, we use the public GOLD catalogs\n\\footnote[2]{\\tt http://cosmo.iaa.es/content/ALHAMBRA-Gold-catalog},\nwhich contains data of seven, out of the eight, ALHAMBRA fields. \nThe magnitude limits of these catalogues are $ \\langle m_{AB} \\rangle \\sim 25$ for the four blue bands and \nfrom $ \\langle m_{AB} \\rangle \\sim 24.7$ mag to $23.4$ mag for the redder ones. \nThe NIR limits at AB magnitudes are $J\\approx$ 24 mag, $H \\approx$ 23 mag, \n$K$ $\\approx$ 22 mag.\nIn the following, the filter nomenclature presented in Table \\ref{table_fname} is used\nand the ALH-4 and ALH-7 fields are excluded from our analysis.\nPrevious authors have shown that overdensities reside in these fields \nand they might alter the redshift distribution of the selected samples \nas well as the clustering measurements (see section \\S\\ref{s_clustering}).\n\n\\cite{arnalte-mur14} obtained the clustering properties of ALHAMBRA galaxies \nand studied the sample variance using the seven independent ALHAMBRA fields.\nThey quantified the impact of individual fields on the final clustering measurements,\nusing the \\cite{norberg11} method, they determined two ``outliers regions'', i.e. ALH-4 and ALH-7 fields.\n\nBesides, part of the ALH-4 field spatially corresponds to the COSMOS field.\nPrevious works have shown that this region is dominated by\nsome large-scale structures (LSS), \nthe most prominent are peaking at $z\\sim 0.7$, and $0.9$ \\citep{scoville07}. \nThese structures have X-ray counterparts and a probability higher than 30$\\%$ of being LSS. \n\\cite{guzzo07} studied the clusters located at the center of the LSS (at $z\\sim$0.7),\nwhile \\cite{finoguenov07} found diffuse X-ray emission in the most compact structures.  \nThere are other LSS found in the COSMOS field,\nbut they fall out of the redshift range of the samples studied in this paper.\n\n\n\\section{Sample selection} \\label{s_sample}\n\n\nTo exclude the stars from the original ALHAMBRA Gold catalog we use \nthe stellarity index given by SExtractor (CLASS-STAR parameter $C(K)$) and \nthe statistical star/galaxy separation \\cite[Section 3.6]{molino13} \nencoded in the variable Stellar-Flag ($S_{alh}$) of the catalogs.\nThroughout the present paper, we define as galaxies those ALHAMBRA sources with $ C(K) \\le 0.8$ and $S_{alh} \\le$ 0.5.\nThe ALHAMBRA Gold catalog is an $F814W$ (i.e. almost an I-band)\nselected catalog. \nThis band was created by the ALHAMBRA team as a linear combination of\nALHAMBRA bands (see Eq. 5 in \\cite{molino13}) ,\nand it was used for their source detection. \nObjects with faint features in this band are not detected,\nit might affect the completeness of the selected samples as will be discussed further in sections \\S \\ref{s_ bjgcomparison} and \\S \\ref{s_discussion_st}.\nThis catalogue is complete up to $F814W =23$ \\citep{molino13},\nhence we use this limit to build our complete sample.\nOn the other hand, the NIR completeness has been studied previously \\citep{ch09}.\nUsing the early release of the first ALHAMBRA field,\nthey determined a change in the slope of the $K$-band number counts in the magnitude range $18.0<K_{Vega}<20.0$ \nand that the data is complete until $K_{VEGA}=20$ or $K_{AB}=21.8$. \nWe have checked the $K$-band numbers counts of the 48 individual pointing that compose the ALHAMBRA GOLD catalog.\nEvery single pointing tends to falls at $K_{AB}\\sim$ 22.\nHereafter, we use the $K_{AB}$=22 limit to define our complete samples. \n\n\\subsection{Selection of star-forming galaxies} \\label{ss_sfg} \n\nWe use the models of \\cite{bc03} convolved with the ALHAMBRA filter system to define a \ntwo-color criteria to select star-forming galaxies analogously to the work of \\cite{daddi04}.\nThey created the $BzK$ color-selection technique \nto cull star-forming galaxies at z>1.4.\nThis technique is based on the Balmer jump,\nwhich is an indicator of recent star formation.\nThey used the models of \\cite{bc03} to identify\nthe redshifted Balmer jump in the z-band,\ncreating the color selection criteria $BzK \\equiv (z-K)_{AB}-(B-z)_{AB} = -0.2$; where\n$BzK \\ge -0.2$ selects star-forming galaxies at $z>1.4$.\nOur approach is analogue to the $BzK$ method,\nin the sense that we also use the \\cite{bc03} models, \nwhereas we record redshifted Balmer jumps in various (diverse) medium-bands \nselecting galaxies at different redshifts. \nIn Fig.\\ref{fig1}, this situation is illustrated, the \ntypical spectrum of a star-forming galaxy redshifted to $z\\sim$0.5,\n$z\\sim$1.0 and $z\\sim$1.5 is shown. \nThe ALHAMBRA bands are overplotted from the optical to NIR ranges.\nWe choose the $U_2$-band to sample the region before the Balmer jump instead of the $B$-band.\nWe select the $U_2$ band because it reaches a higher completeness level with respect to U1.\nObjects that are not detected in the $U_2$ band are also considered in our selection and its magnitude limit is used.\nRedder bands might sample weak features bluewards to the Balmer jump of low redshift galaxies $z < 0.4$.\nThe $K$ band is exactly the same used by \\cite{daddi04}.\nWhile, the z-band is replaced with the variable $X_n$-band, \nwhich covers the optical range from 613\\AA~ to 954\\AA,\ni.e. $X_n$ can be any ALHAMBRA filter from $R_9$ to $z_{20}$ (see Table \\ref{table_fname}).\nThe $X_n$-band samples the region directly red-wards to the Balmer jump,\nhence the $U_2 - X_n$ color indicates the galaxy redshift range depending on the selected $n$.\nOn the other hand, the $X_n - K$ color registers \nthe duration of the star-formation age.\nThe different panels in Fig.\\ref{fig2} and Fig.\\ref{fig3} show the theoretical evolution \\citep{bc03}\nof the $U_2X_nK \\equiv (X_n-K)-(U_2-X_n)$ color as a function of \nredshift with $9<n<20$ ($X_n= R_9,...., z_{20})$.\nThe red, green and blue solid lines show the $U_2X_nK$-color evolution \nof constant star-formation rate models for ages $0.2$, $1$, \nand $2$~Gyr and reddening $E(B-V)=0.3$.\nThe red, green and blue dashed lines show the $U_2X_nK$-color evolution \nof passively evolving models for formation redshift of  $z_f=2,3$ and $6$. \nIn each panel, the star-forming models always lie in the region $U_2X_nK>0$.\nConsequently, in order to select a sample at redshift higher than $z\\sim$0.5, \na combination that involves a $X_n$ filter redder than $R_9$\nmust be used, as it is shown in the bottom panels of Fig. \\ref{fig2} and Fig. \\ref{fig3}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.42,angle=0,trim=5.0cm -1.cm 5.cm 0cm]{shifted_alh_red.eps}\n\n\\caption{ALHAMBRA filter transmission curve covering from

position of the ALHAMBRA filters $R_8$, $I_{14}$, and $z_{20}$, \nlightening the position of the Balmer jump.\nTo select the $BJG$ samples, \nwe use the filter directly redwards to the gray filter to sample the ending position of the Balmer jump.\n}\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{$BJG$ samples} \\label{ss_bbg} \n\nWe use the condition $U_2 X_n K \\equiv (U_2-X_n)-(X_n-K) > 0$\nand the homogeneous coverage in the optical range of the ALHAMBRA filter system,\nwhere $n$ is ranging from $9$ to $20$ ($X_n= R_9,.. ,z_{20}$),\nto select galaxies at redshift $z> 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.85, 0.95, 1.05, 1.1, 1.2, 1.25, 1.3$, respectively.\nIn each ALHAMBRA filter set $U_2 X_n K$, \nthis color condition selects star-forming \nand passive galaxies in the \\emph{wide} mentioned redshift range.\nTheoretically, these selected passive galaxies lie always at higher \nredshift (i.e., $\\Delta z > 0.25$) with respect to the selected star-forming galaxies.\nIn order to select galaxies in a \\emph{narrow} redshift range,\nwe use more than one color condition; first the $(U_2-X_{n})-(X_{n}-K) > 0$ condition with $n=j$,\nto select all galaxies above certain redshift $z_j$\nand secondly we subtract the higher-redshift \nsamples, selected with $n \\ge j+1$ (passive and star-forming), from the first galaxy selection. \nFor example, our lowest redshift sample was selected by imposing the condition\n$U_2R_9K = 0$ (i.e. select galaxies at $z > 0.5$)\nand subtracting the galaxy samples selected by $U_2X_{n}K > 0$ with $n \\ge 10$,\nwhich select all galaxies at $z > 0.6$.\nIn this way, only the star-forming galaxies in the \nredshift range $0.5<z<0.6$ were selected (see yellow shaded region in Fig.\\ref{fig2} and Fig. \\ref{fig3}).\nFollowing this method and using the homogeneous separation between each ALHAMBRA band, \nwe select eleven star-forming galaxy samples peaking at \n$z\\sim 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9,  1.0, 1.05, 1.15, 1,2, 1.25$, and $z\\sim1.4$.\nIt by culling the galaxies that satisfy the star-forming criteria \n$U_2 X_n K \\equiv (U_2-X_n)-(X_n-K) > 0$, \nwhere $X_n= R_9,..., z_{19}$\nand ``cleaned'' of higher redshift galaxies by subtracting the samples that satisfy\n$U_2X_{n}K> 0$, with $n \\ge 10, ..., 20$, respectively.\nTable \\ref{table_sample} summarizes the properties \nof the selected samples using the method described above.\nWe ensure that all samples are roughly independent of each other\nby removing the high redshift samples, whose are selected using the $X_n$ filters\nwith $n \\geq j+1$ (see column 3 of Table \\ref{table_sample}), \nfrom the sample selected with the filter $X_{n=j}$.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Properties of the $BJG$ selected samples.}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\hline\\hline

subsection, we aim to compare the properties, derived from SED fitting, \nof the $BJG$ samples for galaxies of similar $K$-band absolute magnitude, i.e. similar stellar mass.\nTherefore, in addition to restricting the $BJG$ samples within the magnitude survey limit\n(see section \\S\\ref{s_sample}) we also apply an absolute magnitude limit for all samples.\nIn the following, we search for the most appropriate absolute magnitude limit \nthat allows us to build these samples.\nFig.\\ref{fig_completitud} shows the $K$-band absolute magnitude,\nobtained via {\\tt iSEDfit}, as a function of BPZ redshift.\nThe red, orange, green, cyan, light blue and blue dots indicate the galaxies\nin the $BJG_1$, $BJG_4$, $BJG_6$, $BJG_7$, $BJG_9$, and $BJG_{11}$ \nsamples with apparent magnitude brighter than the magnitude survey limit $K=22$, respectively.\nWe can note that {\\it partly} due to Malquist bias,\nthe farthest sample $BJG_{11}$ is roughly complete only until $K_{abs}=-22.5$ (blue dots).\nHowever, by choosing this bright absolute limit to compare all $BJG$ samples \nwe restrict our study only to the most massive and bright objects\nas well as enormously reduce the statistics for each sample, specially at low redshift.\nHence, we decide to study all objects brighter than $K_{abs} = -21.2$,\nwhich correspond to the absolute limit where the $BJG_5$ sample at $z\\sim$1\nis complete and comparable, in terms of $K_{abs}$ luminosity, \nto the other lower redshift $BJG_{n<6}$ samples.\nIn Fig.\\ref{fig_completitud} the black solid line shows the absolute magnitude limit $K_{abs}=-21.2$.\nWe have chosen the $z\\sim1$ limit because the ALHAMBRA Gold data is an $F814W$ (i.e. almost an I-band) selected catalog and\nthus less sensitive to galaxies at $z\\geq$1 with a pronounced Balmer jump.\nFor galaxies at $z\\geq$ 1, the spectral region directly bluewards of the Balmer jump is barely or not detected in the $F814W$\nbecause the Balmer jump falls in the $I_{13}$ and the region directly bluewards to it falls in the $R_{12}$ band.\nSince the $F814W$ image detection is a linear combination involving the $R_{12}$ band, this kind of galaxies are barely or not detected as sources in the final catalog.\nWe expect a deeper selection of galaxies with a pronounced Balmer jump at $z<$1.\nSaid that, the $BJG$ samples at $z\\leqslant1$ selected from $X_{n \\leq 13}$ bands \nare optimized to be complete according to the $F814W$ selection, whereas the samples at $z\\geq$1 are incomplete.\nThe level of incompleteness of the $BJG_{n\\geq6}$ samples is difficult to quantify because there may be many effects \nworking together (e.g. the $F814W$ is a linear combination of ALHAMBRA bands, \nundetectable bluewards regions of the Balmer jump due to intrinsic galaxy properties such as redshift, dust excess, etc.).\nTo minimize the incompleteness of our samples\nin the comparison of the physical properties at different redshifts, \nin the following we re-define the first five $BJG$ samples selecting \nall galaxies brighter than $K_{abs}=-21.2$. \nFurthermore, the $BJG_{n}$ samples, with $n\\ge6$, are not considered in the following analysis.  \nTable~\\ref{table_ppK} presents the properties of the final sample definition ($BJGK_n$, with $n<6$), \nwhich takes into account the absolute luminosity cut ($K_{abs}=-21.2$).\n\nIn Fig.\\ref{fig_ppevol}, the comparison of the physical properties \nof galaxies with similar $K-$band luminosity is shown.\nRed squares show the properties of the $BJGK_n$ (with $n<6$),\nthe dashed lines show the results of \\cite{vandokkum13} \nfor galaxies of similar stellar mass.\nThe colored areas indicate the dispersion of each sample,\nwhile the error bars show the median error of the physical properties derived  via {\\tt iSEDfit}. \nIn section \\S \\ref{s_discussion_pp} these results are discussed.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1.\\linewidth,angle=0,trim=0.5cm .5cm .5cm .5cm, clip=true]{Kabs_z_11.ps}\n\n\\caption{Absolute magnitude as a function of

analysis}\\label{s_clustering}\n\n\n\n\nIn hierarchical clustering, structures build up in time from small \ndensity fluctuations. Small structures agglomerate to build large \nstructures. \nDark matter haloes are biased tracers of the underlying matter density field.\nMassive haloes lie in higher and rarer density peaks and are more clustered than lower mass haloes.\nIf a galaxy population is hosted by haloes of a given mass, \nthen the clustering amplitude of the galaxy population, \ncompared to the expected dark matter clustering at the same redshift, \ncan be used to derive the typical halo mass corresponding to that galaxy population. \nThis is encapsulated in the bias parameter, $b$, defined as $b^2=\\xi_{gal}(r)/\\xi_{DM}(r)$,\nwhere $\\xi_{gal}$ and $\\xi_{DM}$ are the 2-point spatial correlation function for \ngalaxies and dark matter, respectively.\nThe correlation function at a certain redshift, $\\xi(r,z)$,\ncan be characterized with a power law and a correlation length, $r_0$, \nthrough $\\xi(r,z)=(r/r_0(z))^\\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the power index.\nFor sparse samples and at small scales this representation is typically used.\nIn larger surveys and simulations the correlation function is usually\nmodelled combining terms for galaxies in the same halo \nand in different ones \\citep{zehavi11,contreras13}.\n\nIn the following, we measure the bias and \nmasses of the halos that host the $BJGK_{n<6}$ samples.\nSpecifically, for each $BJGK_{n<6}$ sample,\nwe calculate the 2-point angular correlation \nfunction, and then, using Limbers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 de-projection,\ngiven a redshift distribution and a cosmological model,\nwe calculate the correlation length.\nThe bias parameter follows from $r_0$ through $b^2\\simeq \\sigma_{8,gal}^2(r_0,z)/\\sigma_{8,DM}^2(z)$,\nwhere $\\sigma_{8,gal}$ ($\\sigma_{8,DM}$) is the root mean square fluctuation amplitude \nin 8$h^{-1}$~Mpc spheres of galaxies (dark matter).\nThe halo mass is obtained from the bias by using the models of \\cite{sheth_mo_tormen01}.\nWe have chosen this procedure and the 8~$h^{-1}$Mpc scale, \nin order to directly compare our results with previous works\nthat connected progenitors and descendants of samples of star-forming galaxies\n\\citep[see Fig. \\ref{fig_bias},][]{adelberger05,ouchi05,kashikawa06,gawiser07,hildebrandt07,hayashi07,blanc08,hartley08,yoshida08,guaita10,mccracken10,lin12}.\nMore detailed treatments, such as considering both halo terms and different scales,\nare beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n\\begin{table*} \\label{table_clustering}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Clustering properties of the $BJGK$

and mass measurements} \\label{ss_biashalomass}\n\nIn turn we estimate the bias parameter, $b$, from the correlation length.\nAs pointed out above, $b$ is related to $r_0$ through the spatial correlation function by \n$b^2 \\approx \\xi_{gal}(r,z)/\\xi_{DM}(r,z)$ or $b^2 \\approx \\sigma^2_{gal}(r,z)/\\sigma^2_{DM}(r,z)$. \nThe numerator $\\xi_{gal}(r,z) \\approx J_2 \\sigma^2_{gal}(r,z)$\nis taken from \\cite{peebles80}{(Eq. 59.3)}, where $J_2$ is a \nparameter defined in terms of $\\gamma$ as  $J_2=72/[(3-\\gamma)(4-\\gamma)(6-\\gamma)2^\\gamma]$.\nWe fix the spatial scale at 8 $h^{-1}$ Mpc such \nthat $\\xi_{gal}(8,z)=(r_0(z)/8 h^{-1}Mpc)^\\gamma$.\nThe evolution of the dark matter density variance \nin a comoving sphere of radius $8h^{-1}$~Mpc is $\\sigma_{DM}^2(8,z)=\\sigma_8D(z)$,\nwhere $D(z)$ is the linear growth factor at redshift z.\nThe bias measured for each $BJGK$ sample, at the scale of $8h^{-1}$~Mpc, \nis reported in Table~\\ref{table_clustering}.\n\nThe figure \\ref{fig_bias} shows the evolution of the bias factor as a function of redshift for the $BJGK$ samples (red squares).\nThe lines show the bias evolution for different halo masses \\citep{sheth_mo_tormen01}, \nwhose are indicated below of each line in the right side of the panel.\nApproximately, the $BJGK$ samples follows the bias evolution of haloes of masses $\\sim 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\\sun}$.\nFinally, we calculate the halo mass using equation (8) of \\cite{sheth_mo_tormen01} \nthat relates the bias with the peak height, $\\nu = \\delta_{sc}(z)/\\sigma(M,z)$, \nwhere $\\delta_{sc}$ is the critical overdensity computed using the spherical collapse model.\nHere we assume $\\delta_{sc} = 1.69$. \nThen, the halo mass $M_h$ is obtained through $\\sigma(M,z)$ evaluated at \nthe redshifts of the $BJGK$ samples listed in table \\ref{table_ppK}. \n\nIn fig.~\\ref{fig_ivan} the halo mass of the $BJGK$ samples as a function of

\\label{s_discussion_st}\n\nThe new two-color selection technique $U_2X_nK$ based on ALHAMBRA medium-bands,\nallows us to extract eleven samples of star-forming galaxies at $z>$0.5\nin narrower redshift ranges with respect to previous studies \\citep{daddi04,steidel04,adelberger05}.\nThis selection method is based purely on the ALHAMBRA photometric data\nand it does not depends on the models assumptions, methodology \nor templates used to determine the photometric redshifts \nor properties derived from SED fit.\nWe have validated this technique with the \\cite{bc03} models as well as \nchecked with other stellar population synthesis models giving consistent results.\n\n\nThe ALHAMBRA GOLD data is an $F814W$-selected catalog,\nthus is less sensitive to detect the regions bluewards of the Balmer jump of galaxies at $z>$1. \nThe $R_{12}$ band contributes only to $10\\%$ of the final $F814W$ detection image, while  the $I_{13}$,  and $I_{14}$ bands contribute 18$\\%$ each one.\nHence, the detection in the $F814W$ image becomes worse for galaxies at $z\\ge$1 with a pronounced Balmer jump.\n\n\nIn order to avoid any contamination of low-redshift galaxies in our samples, we are inclined to use the bluest band available to sample the region bluewards of the Balmer jump.\nHence, we studied the detection level of the $U_1$ and $U_2$ that reaches $97\\%$ and $99.7\\%$, respectively.\nSince the $U_2$ has a higher detection level with respect to $U_1$, we have tailored the selection technique using the $U_2$ band.\n\n\nTo select samples at $z<$0.5, we tried to use filters bluer than the $R_9$, whose central wavelength is lower than 613.5\\AA.\nNevertheless, the theoretical evolution of the color $U_2X_{n<9}K$ of passive and star-forming galaxies,\nbased on the \\cite{bc03} models, tend to occupy the same locus in the color-redshift ($U_2X_{n<9}K -\\, z$) plane.\nHence, it does not allow to separate the star-forming from the passive galaxies as clear as for the $U_2X_nK$ selection with $n>9$ (see Fig. \\ref{fig2} and Fig. \\ref{fig3}).\n\nThe number density of each $BJG$ sample decreases with redshift,\nprobably due to the nature of these objects or \nalso related to a non-considered Malquist-bias selection effect in the $U_2$-band. \nBesides, we verify our selection method with the BPZ photometric redshifts, \nwhose uncertainty increase with redshift,\nand therefore the number densities might be underestimated according to $\\delta_z(BPZ) = 0.014\\, z(BPZ)$.\n\nAccording to this colour technique (visual inspection of Fig.\\ref{fig2}, and Fig.\\ref{fig3}),\nthe redshift distributions should be narrower than in Fig. \\ref{fig_bpz}.\nThe distributions can become wider if the errors of the photometric redshifts\nare properly taken into account.\nThe mean formal BPZ error of the $BJG_1$ and $BJG_{11}$ samples are 0.02 and 0.03,\ncorresponding to 20$\\%$ and 30$\\%$ of the total expected width ($\\leq$ 0.1), respectively.\nWe performed simulations considering Gaussian redshift distributions\nfilled randomly using the same amount of galaxies found in each sample,\nthe expected width (0.1) and the formal BPZ error $\\delta_z(BPZ) = 0.014(1+z(BPZ))$.\nBy perturbing the photometric redshift with its corresponding error,\nand choosing randomly a positive or negative variance\nthe width of the distributions increase by a factor of 1.5 for the first $BJG_1$ sample,\nand up to 2 times this value for the $BJG_{11}$ sample, with increasing redshift.\nClearly, higher photometric redshift errors increase the distribution width.\nIn the AHAMBRA data, BPZ tends to decrease its precision at I < 24.5 AB (Molino et al. 2014).\nThe global redshift distribution shows a mean of <z>$=0.86$ at this magnitude limit.\nHence the distributions at $z\\geq 0.9$ tend to broaden even more because the \nphotometric redshift errors are bigger than $0.014(1+z)$.\nConsidering a distribution at $z\\sim1$ with an original width of 0.1 and $\\delta_z(BPZ) = 0.03(1+z(BPZ))$, \nthe width increase up to three times.\nOutlayers due to either photometric redshift or\nthe color selection technique can also contribute to the tails \nas well as broader the photometric redshift distributions.\n\n\nWe have also investigated the selection method creating an $X_n$ band composed of two, \nthree and four consecutive ALHAMBRA bands.\nIndeed, it increases the statistics, accuracy, and width of the redshift distribution of each sample. Nevertheless, \nin order to fully exploit the capabilities of a multi-medium band survey in selecting galaxies in small redshift ranges,\nwe choose to use an unique band in our selection method.\n\n\\cite{viironen15} have shown that using the redshift probability distributions is possible to obtain a clean galaxy sample, \nwhich is by definition (intrinsically) not complete.\nThe fact of choosing certain probability threshold implies that\nsome galaxies will be not considered in the final sample. \nTo overcome the purity versus completeness issue, \nthey suggest to use the information of the whole zPDF to select each sample.\nIn this work we aim to tailor and use a two-color criteria that considers all the observational data available,\nselecting a \\emph{complete} sample, but at the same time is probably more \\emph{contaminated} than \nthe samples selected via the redshift probability distributions.\nWe have used the zBPZ-$BJG$ distributions to calculate this contamination,\nby estimating how many objects have a BPZ redshift lower/higher than 3-$\\sigma$\nof its corresponding redshift distribution. \nThus, it encompasses from 1$\\%$ to 15$\\%$ of each sample depending on redshift.\nSpecifically, 1$\\%$, 2$\\%$, 2$\\%$, 3$\\%$, 4$\\%$, 5$\\%$, 6$\\%$, 7$\\%$, 8$\\%$, 10$\\%$, 12$\\%$,\nand 15$\\%$ of the sample $BJG_1$, $BJG_2$, $BJG_3$, $BJG_4$, $BJG_5$,\n$BJG_6$, $BJG_7$, $BJG_8$, $BJG_9$, $BJG_{10}$, and $BJG_{11}$, respectively.\n\n\n\\subsection{Progenitors and descendants}  \\label{s_discussion_c}\nWe have obtained the masses of the haloes where our $BJGK$ samples reside (see Fig.\\ref{fig_ivan}).\nThe galaxy samples of similar $K$-band absolute magnitude \nreside on haloes of $10^{12.5 \\pm 0.2} M_{\\sun}$.\nIn terms of progenitors and descendants for the median halo mass, \nthe progenitors are the LBGs with $R < 25$ at $z\\sim$3 \\citep{adelberger05,hildebrandt07}, \nthe $sBzK$ galaxies with $K\\leq23$ at $z\\sim$2 \\citep{hayashi07,hartley08,mccracken10,lin12} \nand the descendants in the local Universe are ``elliptical'' galaxies\nwith luminosities around 2 $L_*$ (see Fig.\\ref{fig_bias}).\nFor haloes around the upper limit $10^{12.7} M_{\\sun}$,\nwe find as progenitors at $z\\sim$3 the LBGs \\citep{hildebrandt07} with $R\\leq 24$,\nwhile at $z\\sim$2 the sBzK galaxies with $K \\leq 23$ \\citep{hartley08,lin12} and\nthe descendants are elliptical galaxies with luminosities around 3 $L_*$.\nFor the haloes around the lower limit $10^{12.3 }  M_{\\sun}$, \nthe progenitors are the LBGs at $z\\sim$4 \\citep{kashikawa06,ouchi05} with I or z$\\leq 27$,\nthe LAE galaxies at $z\\sim$3 \\citep{gawiser07},\nthe sBzK galaxies \\citep{hayashi07} with $K<23$ at $z\\sim$2,\nthe descendants are ``elliptical'' with luminosities around 1 $L_*$.\n\nThe {\\it increment} of the median halo mass of $\\sim$ 0.4~dex, between $z=1.0$ and $z=0.5$,\nfollows the observed mass increment in numerical simulations \\citep[Millennium,][]{fakhouri10}.\nIt suggests that we are tracing the evolution of the haloes of masses around \n$\\sim 10^{12.5}$ from $z=1.0$ to $z=0.5$,\nand hence the evolution of the physical properties as it is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig_ppevol}.\nSo far, via clustering measurements, we have argued that our five sets of galaxies $BJGK_{n<6}$ \nrepresent a coeval and homogeneous population of star-forming galaxies.\n\n\nThe bias and hence halo mass of the $BJGK$ samples are on average higher\nthan the one's found in \\cite{hurtado15} for star-forming galaxies.\nFor all redshift ranges studied, our correlation lengths are ~$20\\%$ higher \nwith respect to their work \nsuggesting that we are selecting more massive galaxies.\nIt might be due to the different galaxy selection methods as well as\nthe absolute magnitude thresholds used to define complete samples.\nNevertheless, the main difference relies on the method and\nthe scale that we have chosen to calculate the bias, and hence the halo mass.\nIn \\cite{hurtado15}, they calculate the bias for the scale range $1.0 <r<10~$Mpc,\nwhile in this work we evaluate the bias in the scale 8~$h^{-1}$Mpc in order to compare with previous works that also studied the progenitors and descendants of star-forming galaxies.\nBy taking this approach, we obtain halo masses 0.7~dex higher than in \\citep{hurtado15}.\n\n\\subsection{Physical properties} \\label{s_discussion_pp}\n\nWe perform an accurate estimation of the physical properties derived from SED fitting \n(e.g. absolute magnitude, stellar mass, star formation rate, etc.) \nand characterize each sample as a whole with the median of each properties.\n\nFigure \\ref{fig_ppevol} shows the median values of the probability distribution of stellar mass, \nabsolute magnitude, star formation rate for the $BJGK_{n<6}$ (red squares)\nsamples as a function of redshift.\n\nIn the stellar mass panel, \nthe dashed line shows the evolution of the stellar mass for galaxies \nwith present-day stellar masses of $log(M_*)\\approx 10.7$, as our Milky way galaxy,\ntaken from the analysis of the CANDELS survey by \\cite{vandokkum13}.\nThere is a good agreement between the observed mass growth determined by \\cite{vandokkum13},\nwhich slightly increase by a factor of 0.1~dex from $z=1$ to $z=0.5$ \nand the flat behavior found in this work.\nIn the star formation rate panel, \nthe dashed line shows the evolution of the implied star formation rate \ndue to the evolution of the stellar mass of galaxies \nwith present-day stellar masses of $log(M_*)\\approx 10.7$,\nas our Milky way, also taken from \\cite{vandokkum13}.\nOur results falls slightly below suggesting that $SFR$ is sufficient to \naccount for the increment in stellar mass between $z=1$ and $z=0.5$ \nas well as major mergers play a minor role in the mentioned redshift range.\n\nYet, the evolution of the $SFR$ and $sSFR$ resembles the expected ``main-sequence'' behavior\nof star-forming galaxies \\citep{rodighiero11}.\n\nThe $BJGK$ evolution, from $z\\sim$1 to z=0, of the $B$-band absolute luminosity agrees with the \nevolution measured by \\cite{zcosmos}. \nThey found that the contribution of disks to the total $B$-band luminosity decreases by 30$\\%$ \nfrom $z\\sim$1 to z=0, while the $BJGs$ decrease their median $B$-band luminosity by a factor of 0.5~dex. \nThe distribution of galaxy ages obtained by {\\tt iSEDfit} has a large dispersion,\neven so, its increment between two epochs corresponds to the Universe age increment indicated by the redshift.\nAccording to the models of \\cite{lagos14}, galaxies of properties similar to the $BJG$s host most of the neutral gas at $0.5<z<1.5$. \nHence the $BJG$ samples contain tentative targets to sample the neutral gas with sub-millimeter surveys.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\\label{s_conclusions}\n\n\nWe have selected eleven samples of star-forming galaxies by using a two-color technique \nbased on the \\cite{bc03} models convolved with the ALHAMBRA filters.\nUsing clustering arguments, we have confirmed that \nfive out of the eleven sets of galaxies, i.e. the $BJGK_{n<6}$,\nrepresent a coeval and homogeneous population of star-forming galaxies.\nThe properties derived from SED fitting, such as stellar mass, star formation rate, age, absolute luminosity,\nof each $BJGK_{n<6}$ sample are characterized as a\nwhole allowing us to study their putative evolution as a function of redshift.\nThe main results can be summarized as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item We tailor a two-color selection technique, \n based on the \\cite{bc03} models and the Balmer jump that select star-forming galaxies in the redshift range $0.5<z<1.5$.\n We select eleven samples composed of Balmer jump Galaxies, dubbed $BJG$. \n The amount of photometric-redshift outliers in these color-selected samples increases with redshift ranging from 1$\\%$ to 15$\\%$.\n \\item We create a sub-sample of $BJG$, dubbed $BJGK_n$ with $n<6$, \n which considers only the $BJG_{n<6}$ galaxies brighter than $K_{abs}\\sim-21.2$.\n The stellar mass of the $BJGK$ samples nearly does not change with redshift,\n suggesting that major mergers played a minor role on the evolution of the $BJGK$ galaxies.\n The SFR evolution accounts for the small variations of the stellar mass, \n from $z \\sim 1$ to $z \\sim 0.5$,\n suggesting that star formation and minor mergers are the main channels of mass assembly.\nAlthough the distribution of galaxy ages obtained by {\\tt iSEDfit} has a large dispersion, the evolution of the galaxy age agrees with the evolution of the Universe age.\n  \n \\item The $BJGK_{n<6}$ samples reside on haloes of $10^{12.5 \\pm 0.2} M_{\\sun}$,\nwhich progenitors are the LBGs with $R \\leq 24$ at $z\\sim$3 \\citep{hildebrandt07}, \nthe $sBzK$ galaxies \\citep{lin12,hartley08,mccracken10} with $K\\leq23$ at $z\\sim$2\nand descendants are elliptical galaxies with luminosities around 1-3 $L_*$ \n(for details see Fig.\\ref{fig_bias}).\n\n \\item The similar increment of the median halo mass between $z=1.0$ and $z=0.5$\nof our observational results and numerical simulations \\citep[Millennium,][]{fakhouri10}\nsuggest that we are tracing the evolution of haloes of masses around $\\sim 10^{12.5}$ from $z=1.0$ to $z=0.5$, and hence the putative evolution of the physical properties \nof the galaxies hosted by these haloes (see Fig. \\ref{fig_ppevol}).\n \\end{itemize}\n\nThe homogeneous coverage of the ALHAMBRA optical bands from $R_9$ to $z_{20}$,\nallows us to trace the evolution of the baryonic processes occurring on star-forming galaxies,\nfrom $z\\sim 1.0$ to $z\\sim 0.5$, which reside on haloes of masses $\\sim 10^{12.5} h^{-1} M_{\\sun}$.\nIt corresponds roughly to a stellar mass upper (lower) limit of $\\sim 10^{11} M_{\\sun} (10^{10} M_{\\sun})$.\nDeeper ALHAMBRA data as well as {\\it near-infrared selected catalogs}, \nwould allow us to study the evolution of the physical properties on haloes of masses lower\nthan $10^{12.5} M_{\\sun}$ from $z\\sim 0.5$ to $z\\sim 1.5$.
