In a number of books and textbooks \nsuch fast electrons are called the $\\delta-$electrons. The velocity of these $\\delta-$electron is less, but always comparable with the velocity of the $\\beta-$electron. Sudden \nacceleration to large and very large velocities proceeds when the emitted $\\beta^{-}-$electron interact with slow electron from Eq.(\\ref{eq1}) and transfers to that electron a \nsubstantial part of its incident momentum. It is clear that the probability of such a process is small. In the lowest-order approximation such a probability is evaluated as $P \n\\approx \\alpha^4 P_e$, where $P_e$ is the probability of the free-electron emission in the process, Eq.(\\ref{eq1}) and $\\alpha = \\frac{e^2}{\\hbar c} \\approx \\frac{1}{137}$ is the \ndimensionless fine-structure constant. More accurate evaluation leads to the formula which contain an additional factor which increases the numerical value of $P$. The main goal \nof this study is to obtain the more accurate formulas to evaluate the overall probability of emission of the fast $\\delta-$electrons during $\\beta^{-}$ decay in few-electron atoms \nand ions. In addition to this, we also want to predict some properties of the fast $\\delta-$elelctrons, Eq.(\\ref{eq2}), e.g., their energy distribution.      \n\nIt is clear that the emission of the fast $\\delta-$electron during nuclear $\\beta^{-}$ decay in few-electron atoms/ions is a pure QED process. The source of the fast $\\delta-$electrons \nis the electromagnetic interaction between the fast $\\beta^{-}$-particle (electron) and atomic electrons. Briefly, we need to consider the non-elastic electron-electron scattering \nwhere one of the incident electrons was very fast, while another electron was at rest. First, consider the case when $\\beta^{-}$-decaying atom has one bound electron only. In actual \nexperiments this case corresponds to the tritium atom ${}^{3}$H. In this case we can write the following formula known from QED (see, e.g, \\cite{Grein}, \\cite{AB}) for the \ncross-section of the $(e^{-},e^{-})$-scattering: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n d\\sigma = 2 \\pi \\alpha^4 a^{2}_{0} \\Bigl(\\frac{\\gamma_1 + 1}{\\gamma^{2}_1 v^{4}_1}\\Bigr) \\Bigl[ \\frac{4}{\\tau^{4}} - \\frac{3}{\\tau^{2}} + \\frac{(\\gamma^{2}_1 - 1)^{2}}{4 \\gamma^{2}_1} \n \\Bigl(1 + \\frac{4}{\\tau^{2}}\\Bigr)\\Bigr] \\sin\\theta d\\theta  \\label{eq3}\n\\end{eqnarray}  \nwhere $\\gamma_1 = \\frac{E_1}{m c^2}$ is the Lorentz $\\gamma-$factor of the $\\beta-$electron, $\\alpha = \\frac{e^{2}}{\\hbar c} \\approx 7.2973525664 \\cdot 10^{-3}$ is the dimensionless \nfine-structure constant and $a_0 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \\approx 5.2917721092(17) \\cdot 10^{-9}$ $cm$ is the Bohr radius. In Eq.(\\ref{eq3}) the factor $\\tau^{2}$ is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  \\tau^{2} = 1 - \\Bigl[\\frac{2 - (\\gamma_1 + 3) \\sin^{2}\\theta}{2 + (\\gamma_1 - 1) \\sin^{2}\\theta}\\Bigr]^{2} \\label{eq4}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\theta$ is the azimuthal angle, or scattering angle, if we take into account the cylindrycal symmetry of the scattering problem formulated above. The formulas, Eqs.(\\ref{eq3}) \nand (\\ref{eq4}) allow one to determine the angular distribution (or $\\theta-$distribution) of the fast secondary electrons ($\\delta-$electrons) emitted during the nuclear $\\beta^{-}$ \ndecay of the one-electron tritium atom ${}^{3}$H, or an arbitrary one-electron ion. \n\nNow, by using the formulas, Eqs.(\\ref{eq3}) and (\\ref{eq4}), we can represent the differential cross-section, Eq.(\\ref{eq3}) in a different form. First, let us introduce the dimensionless \nparameter $\\Delta = \\frac{\\gamma_2 - 1}{\\gamma_1 - 1}$ ($0 \\le \\Delta \\le 1$) which equals to the ratio of energies of the $\\delta-$ and $\\beta-$electrons emitted in the process, \nEq.(\\ref{eq2}). The parameters $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ in this formula are the $\\gamma-$factors of the $\\beta$- and $\\delta$-electrons, respectively. Here and everywhere below, we \nassume that the $\\delta-$electron from Eq.(\\ref{eq3}) was at rest before nuclear $\\beta^{-}$-decay (atomic velocities are negligible in comparison to $v_{\\beta}$). By using a \nstandard set of the conservation laws one can transform the formula for the parameter $\\Delta$ to the following (equivalent) form(s): $\\Delta = \\frac{\\gamma_1 - \n\\gamma^{\\prime}_1}{\\gamma_1 - 1} = \\frac12 (1 - \\tau)$, where $\\gamma^{\\prime}_1$ is the Lorentz $\\gamma-$factor of the $\\beta^{-}$ electron at the final stage (after the scattering)\nand parameter $\\tau$ is defined by Eq.(\\ref{eq4}). Substitution of the last expression in Eq.(\\ref{eq3}) leads to the following formula for the differential cross-section:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  d\\sigma &=& \\frac{2 \\pi \\alpha^4 a^{2}_{0} \\gamma^{2}_1}{(\\gamma^{2}_1 - 1) (\\gamma_1 - 1)} \\cdot \\frac{d\\Delta}{\\Delta^2 (1 - \\Delta)^2} \\Bigl\\{ 1 - \\Bigl[ 3 - \\Bigl(\\frac{\\gamma_1 \n - 1}{\\gamma_1}\\Bigr)^2 \\Bigr] \\Delta ( 1 - \\Delta) \\nonumber \\\\\n\n &+& \\Bigl(\\frac{\\gamma_1 - 1}{\\gamma_1}\\Bigr)^2 \\Delta^2 (1 - \\Delta)^2 \\Bigr\\} \\label{eq5}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nThis formula gives the energy distribution for the secondary electrons (or delta-electrons) from the process, Eq.(\\ref{eq2}). For small $\\Delta$ one finds from Eq.(\\ref{eq5}): $d\\sigma = \n\\frac{2 \\pi \\alpha^4 a^{2}_{0} \\gamma^{2}_{1}}{(\\gamma^{2}_1 - 1) (\\gamma_1 - 1)} \\cdot \\frac{d\\Delta}{\\Delta^2}$. \n\nThe formula, Eq.(\\ref{eq5}), can be used to determine the final state probabities of the emission of the fast secondary electrons (or $\\delta-$electrons) during nuclear $\\beta^{-}$-decay \nin few-electron atoms. Being renormalized in a special way the same formula can be used to describe the energy spectrum of the fast $\\delta-$electrons emitted in the process, Eq.(\\ref{eq2}). \nHowever, in actual applications to few-electron atoms and ions the formula, Eq.(\\ref{eq5}), must include an additional factor which represents a correction to the finite electron-electron \ndistances of the electron-electron scattering in any actual $\\beta^{-}$-decaying atom. Derivation of the formula, Eq.(\\ref{eq5}), in QED is based on the assumption that the incident \nelectron-electron distance is infinite. Evaluation of the finite-distance correction can be based on the fact that in actual atoms the distance $2 a_{0}$ can be considered as `infinte' \ndistance, while actual atomic electrons are located at the distance $\\langle r_{eN} \\rangle \\ll 2 a_0$ from the atomic nucleus which emits the fast $\\beta^{-}$ electron. By comparing the \ncorresponding solid angles in both cases one finds that the additional factor which must be included in the formula, Eq.(\\ref{eq5}), is written in the form $\\langle \\frac{8}{r^{2}_{eN}} \n\\rangle$. The final form of the equations, Eq.(\\ref{eq5}), is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  d\\sigma &=& \\zeta \\frac{16 N_e \\pi \\alpha^4 a^{2}_{0} \\gamma^{2}_1}{(\\gamma^{2}_1 - 1) (\\gamma_1 - 1)} \\cdot \\langle \\frac{a^{2}_0}{r^{2}_{eN}} \\rangle \\cdot \\frac{d\\Delta}{\\Delta^2 (1 \n  - \\Delta)^2} \\Bigl\\{ 1 - \\Bigl[ 3 - \\Bigl(\\frac{\\gamma_1 - 1}{\\gamma_1}\\Bigr)^2 \\Bigr] \\Delta ( 1 - \\Delta) \\nonumber \\\\\n\n  &+& \\Bigl(\\frac{\\gamma_1 - 1}{\\gamma_1}\\Bigr)^2 \\Delta^2 (1 - \\Delta)^2 \\Bigr\\} \\label{eq55}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nwhere the $N_e$ is the total number of bound electrons in the incident atom/ion, while $\\langle \\frac{a^{2}_0}{r^{2}_{eN}} \\rangle$ is the atomic expectation value which must be computed \nwith the use of accurate atomic wave functions. Additional factor $\\zeta$ in the formula, Eq.(\\ref{eq55}), is used to produce the `best' approximation of the formula, Eq.(\\ref{eq55}) to the \nexperimental results known for the fast $\\delta-$electrons. Now, the expression, Eq.(\\ref{eq55}), can be used for actual atoms and ions. For instance, for the beta-decaying two-electron \nNa$^{9+}$ ion (in its ground $1^1S-$state) we have $N_e = 2$ and $\\langle \\frac{1}{r^{2}_{eN}} \\rangle \\approx$ 230.2388870075436700 $\\approx$ 230.239 $a.u.$ \\cite{Fro2015} ($a_0 = 1$ in \n$a.u.$). Therefore, the coefficient $16 N_e \\pi \\alpha^4 a^{2}_{0} \\cdot \\langle \\frac{1}{r^{2}_{eN}} \\rangle$ in the right-hand side of this equation is 1.83799$\\cdot 10^{-21}$ $cm^{2}$ (at \n$\\zeta = 1$). For analogous Co$^{25+}$ ion (in its ground $1^1S-$state) we have $\\langle \\frac{1}{r^{2}_{eN}} \\rangle \\approx$ 1428.872976503642391 $\\approx$ 1428.873 $a.u.$ \\cite{Fro2015}, \nand therefore, this coefficient is 1.140662$\\cdot 10^{-20}$ $cm^{2}$. For the four-electron Be atom in its ground $2^1S-$state we have found that 2.299034$\\cdot 10^{-22}$. These examples \nindicate clearly that the factor $16 N_e \\pi a^{2}_{0} \\cdot \\langle \\frac{1}{r^{2}_{eN}} \\rangle$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq55}) is a relatively large value (even for light atoms and ions). Finally, it \nis possible to say that the overall probability to observe fast $\\delta-$electrons is $\\approx \\alpha^3$ (or even $\\approx \\alpha^2$). In turn, this unambiguously leads to the conclusion that \nthe emission of the fast secondary electrons (or $\\delta-$electrons) can be observed in modern experiments. \n\nFor actual $\\beta^{-}-$decaying atoms the formulas, Eqs.(\\ref{eq4}), (\\ref{eq5}) and (\\ref{eq55}), must be integrated (over the variable $\\gamma_1$) with the actual spectrum of the emitted \n$\\beta^{-}$ electrons \\cite{Fermi} (see also \\cite{Long} - \\cite{Mei}, \\cite{Konop} and references therein). For instance, the explicit formula for the probability to detect the final \n$\\delta-$electron with the Lorentz $\\gamma-$factor $\\gamma_2$ is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  P(\\gamma_2) = \\int_{1}^{\\gamma_{max}} \\Bigl(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d \\Delta}\\Bigr) \\Bigl(\\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\gamma_1}\\Bigr) S_{\\beta}(\\gamma_1) d\\gamma_1 = (\\gamma_2 - 1) \\int_{1}^{\\gamma_{max}} \n  \\Bigl(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d \\Delta}\\Bigr) S_{\\beta}(\\gamma_1) \\frac{d\\gamma_1}{(\\gamma_1 - 1)^2} \\label{eq7}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nwhich can formally be considered as an integral transformation of the spectra of $\\beta^{-}$ electrons (primary fast electrons). The kernel of this integral transformation equals \n$\\Bigl(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d \\Delta}\\Bigr) \\Bigl(\\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\gamma_1}\\Bigr) = \\frac{1}{(\\gamma_1 - 1)^2} \\Bigl(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d \\Delta}\\Bigr)$. In this equation the derivative \n$\\frac{d\\sigma}{d \\Delta}$ is the differential cross-section defined by Eq.(\\ref{eq55}), while another derivative $\\frac{d\\Delta}{d\\gamma_1}$ is determined from the definition of $\\Delta$ \n(see above). The spectral function $S_{\\beta}(\\gamma_1)$ takes the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  S_{\\beta}(\\gamma_1) d\\gamma &=& {\\cal C}_{\\gamma} \\cdot F(Q + 1, (\\gamma - 1) m_e c^2) \\cdot \\Bigl[ \\frac{\\Delta E^{\\prime} +  m_e c^{2}}{m_e c^{2}} - \\gamma \\Bigr]^2 \n  (\\gamma^2 - 1)^{\\frac12} \\cdot \\gamma d\\gamma \\label{eq65} \\\\\n\n  &=& {\\cal C}^{\\prime}_{\\gamma} \\cdot F(Q + 1, \\gamma - 1) \\cdot \\Bigl[ \\frac{\\Delta E^{\\prime}}{m_e c^{2}} - \\gamma \\Bigr]^2 (\\gamma^2 - 1)^{\\frac12} \\cdot \\gamma d\\gamma \\nonumber \n\\end{eqnarray} \nThis expression almost excatly coincides with the formula, Eq.(210), derived in \\cite{Bethe}, which, however, contains no Fermi function introduced in \\cite{Fermi}. In general, the assumption \nthat $F(Q + 1, \\gamma - 1) = 1$ works well for light atoms, but for intermedium ($Q \\ge 40$) and heavy ($Q \\ge 75$) atoms the actual Fermi factor is needed. Accurate numerical evaluations of \nthe Fermi function have been performed in a large number of papers (see, e.g., \\cite{Long}, \\cite{Mei}). Experimental energy spectra of the emited primary $\\beta^{-}$ electrons can be found, \ne.g., in \\cite{Cook} and \\cite{Neary}, where the $\\beta^{-}$ decays of the ${}^{64}$Cu and ${}^{210}$Bi atoms were studied in detail. As follows from Eq.(\\ref{eq65}), the upper limit in the\nformula, Eq.(\\ref{eq65}), equals $\\gamma_{max} = \\frac{\\Delta E^{\\prime}}{m_e c^{2}}$. The velocity/energy spectra of the fast $\\delta-$electrons are determined from the equations which are\nsimilar to Eq.(\\ref{eq65}).   \n\nTo conclude our analysis let us note that emission of the fast secondary electrons can also be observed during nuclear $\\beta^{+}$-decay in few-electron atoms. Most of the formulas derived  \nabove can also be applied to description of such process. However, there are some differences which are quite obvious. A detalied analysis of this process will be performed in our next study.   \n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{01}\n\n\\bibitem{Fro1} A.M. Frolov and D.M.
