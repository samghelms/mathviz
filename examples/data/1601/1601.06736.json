projection onto the lowest Landau level.\nThe method essentially replaces lowest Landau level projection by projection onto the $M$ lowest eigenstates of a suitably chosen hamiltonian acting within the lowest Landau level.\nThe resulting ``energy projection'' is a controlled approximation to the exact lowest Landau level projection which improves with increasing $M$.\n It allows us to study projected trial wave functions for system sizes close to the maximal sizes that can be reached by exact diagonalization and can be straightforwardly applied in any geometry.\n As a first application and test case, we study a class of trial wave functions first proposed by Girvin and Jach\\cite{Girvin84}, which are modifications of the Laughlin states involving a single real parameter.\n While these modified Laughlin states probably represent the same universality class exemplified by the Laughlin wave functions, we show by extensive numerical work for systems on the sphere and torus that they provide a significant improvement of the variational energy, overlap with the exact wave function and properties of the entanglement spectrum.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section {INTRODUCTION}\n\\label{sec:Introduction}\n\nMuch of our understanding of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) and other strongly correlated systems comes from trial wave functions which describe the ground state and low lying excitations of the various phases of these systems.\nA crucial step in constructing most of these trial wave functions is restriction of the Hilbert space of the system so that only single particle states in a low lying band can be occupied.\nIn the case of the FQHE, the single particle states are usually restricted to the lowest Landau level (LLL).\nSometimes it is possible to get a simple closed form expression for the trial states which satisfies this requirement,\nas in the case of Laughlin's trial wave functions\\cite{Laughlin83}, for the Hall conductance plateau at filling $\\nu=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nHowever, more often, trial wave functions are constructed from some physical intuition without taking this restriction into account and then explicitly projected onto the LLL.\nThis is most famously the case for Jain's composite fermion (CF) wave functions\\cite{Jain89,Jain_CF},\nwhich give a good description of the physics of the Hall effect at fillings\nthroughout the region of the LLL where it is observed.\nThe simplest of these wave functions are of the form \n\n\n", "index": 1, "text":

the external field.\nHowever, for other values of $d$, there is no such interpretation and the projection is not straightforward to perform even on the plane.\nA torus version of these states can also be constructed and has been examined for up to $N=4$ particles in {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Fremling13}}}. Using EP, we are able to study these wave functions in any geometry (we focus on sphere and torus here) and\n\nat much larger sizes. \n\n\n\n \n\\section{Energy Projection}\n\nIn our projection scheme, we find a number of low energy eigenstates of some reasonable hamiltonian (most commonly the Coulomb hamiltonian) acting within the LLL.\nWe then project the trial wave function onto this set of low energy states.\nThe idea is that for any reasonable trial wave function, we will find nearly the entire projection onto the LLL using a number of eigenstates of the hamiltonian which is very small compared to the size of the LLL.\nBefore we analyze whether this approach really works, a rough analysis of the computation time involved is useful.\nParticularly, we should compare the time it takes to calculate the energy\nprojection of a state to the time taken to calculate the exact projection. \n\nWe will assume that the real space form of the trial wave function $\\psi$ before LLL-projection can be easily calculated.\nThe exact LLL-projection of $\\psi$ can then be found by calculating its overlaps $\\left\\langle {\\phi_{\\vec{n}}} | {\\psi} \\right\\rangle$ with the Fock states $\\phi_{\\vec{n}}$ labeled by the occupation numbers $\\vec{n}$ of the LLL-orbitals.\nCalculation of these overlaps can be done by Monte Carlo integration.\nThe number of orbitals in the LLL equals $N_{\\Phi}$ (up to small geometry dependent corrections) and hence for a fermionic system, the number of Fock states spanning the LLL is $\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nThe evaluation of a single Fock state (using Gaussian elimination to evaluate the determinant) scales as $N^3$, where $N$ is the number of particles.\nIf we denote by $N_{MC}$ the average number of evaluations per Fock state necessary to find the overlaps with $\\psi$ to the desired accuracy, then the total time needed for the LLL-projection of $\\psi$ scales as $N^3 N_{MC} \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nThe factor $\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$ clearly increases very fast with both $N$ and $N_{\\phi}$.\nAt fixed filling fraction $\\nu$, we have $N_{\\phi}\\approx\\nu^{-1}N$ and, defining $\\xi=\\nu^{-1}$ we see that

$\\prod_{i<j}(z_{i}-z_{j})^{2p}$ can be thought of as attaching $2p$ magnetic flux quanta to each of the electrons, or more naively, we can think of it as just lowering the correlation energy by keeping the electrons well separated.\nThe factor $\\chi^{(CF)}$ is a Slater determinant built from single particle wave functions for a system at effective flux $N_{\\Phi}^{(eff)}=N_{\\Phi}- 2pN$.\nThis factor usually has nonzero occupation of states in higher Landau levels which means its polynomial part will depend on $\\bar{z}_{i}$ as well as $z_{i}$.\nThe explicit orthogonal projection $P_{LLL}$ onto the LLL is then needed to bring the trial state back into the LLL Fock space.\n\nThe projection $P_{LLL}$ is hard to implement exactly.\nThe simplest method is to calculate the overlap of the unprojected trial states with the LLL Fock states by Monte Carlo integration, but this is only feasible for small system sizes.\nAlternatively, one may use algebraic methods based on normal ordering and converting occurrences of $\\bar{z}_{i}$ to derivatives $\\partial_{z_{i}}$ (see \\eg {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Girvin84}}}), but this too can only be done for small system sizes.\nIn

diagonalization of the exact hamiltonian and then only for composite fermion type wave functions on a plane or sphere.\nThere is considerable interest now in studying systems on a torus, because this

have nonzero overlaps of comparable size with a significant fraction of the Fock states in the LLL.\nHence, if we define $f=|\\left\\langle {\\psi} | {P_{LLL}\\psi} \\right\\rangle|^2$, then the Monte Carlo integration has to resolve overlaps of typical size $\\sqrt{f/\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}}$.\nThis means that the allowable error on a given overlap should also be very small.\nIn fact, if the typical error on the overlaps is $\\epsilon$, then if we are very optimistic and take the errors on the overlaps to be independent of each other, we expect an overall error on the projection of $\\psi$ which is of order $\\sqrt{\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}}\\epsilon$.\nTo bring this back to something of order $\\sqrt{f}$, we require that $\\epsilon\\sim \\sqrt{f/\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}}$.\nThe statistical error in the Monte Carlo integration will normally be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of independent Monte Carlo samples generated, and we expect that the number of independent samples will be (at most) of order $\\frac{N_{MC}}{N}$.\nHence for the desired accuracy, we require that $N_{MC}\\sim N\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}/f$.\nThis yields an (optimistic) estimate of the scaling of computation effort for exact LLL-projection as $f^{-1}N^4 \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}^2$. \n\nClearly, this is problematic in studying large systems.\nNevertheless naively, it would seem that obtaining exact states for comparison to these trial states may be even more onerous, as numerical diagonalization scales naively as the third power the Hilbert space dimension, \\ie $\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}^3$.\nIn practice however, the hamiltonians of interest are relatively sparse, usually have a high degree of symmetry and we are normally only interested in a small number of low lying eigenstates.\nAs a result, the LLL-projection of the trial wave functions as described here nearly always becomes impossible at system sizes considerably smaller than those accessible to exact diagonalization methods. \n\nNow consider the computational effort needed to perform energy projection.\nWe will assume first of all that we can get a good approximation of the exact\nprojection using the lowest $M$ eigenstates of the chosen hamiltonian.\nHere $M$ should be a number that does not grow quickly with $N$, in particular, $M\\ll \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nWe will ignore the computational effort needed to obtain the $M$ lowest eigenstates of the hamiltonian -- we will usually work at system sizes where this is not the bottleneck of the computation.\nThe energy projection is simply the projection onto the $M$-dimensional\nsubspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the $M$ lowest eigenstates.\nIt involves calculating the overlaps $\\left\\langle {i} | {\\psi} \\right\\rangle$, where $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$, $i\\in\\{1,...M\\}$ labels the lowest $M$ eigenstates of the hamiltonian.\nEach state $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$ involves up to $\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$ Fock states. Hence a single evaluation of the state $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$ in real space takes effort of order $N^3\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nOnce the Fock states have all been evaluated, we can keep their values (subject to memory constraints) and use them to evaluate the other $M-1$ eigenstates of the hamiltonian.\nEvaluation of the $M$ overlaps needed for the energy projection then takes effort of order $(N^3 +M-1)\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N} N'_{MC}$, where $N'_{MC}$ is the average number of evaluations of the states $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$ needed to get good Monte Carlo estimates of the overlaps.\nThe main advantage of energy projection is that the individual overlaps involved should now be much larger than the overlaps with individual Fock states.\nWe now expect the average overlap to be $\\sqrt{f/M}$ and to get the error on the projection of $\\psi$ to be of order $\\sqrt{f}$, we will need $N'_{MC}\\sim N M/f$, giving an estimate for the total computational effort involved in energy projection as $f^{-1}M N (N^3 + M-1) \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nThis is clearly much better scaling than exact projection, as long as $M\\ll  \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$ and $M<N^3$ which usually the case, or in any event if  $M^2\\ll  \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$. \nThis scaling can be further improved if the trial wave function is an eigenstate of some symmetry of the hamiltonian, because in that case, we only need to consider overlaps with eigenstates with the same symmetry, reducing $M$.  \nIt turns out that energy projection usually allows us to work with trial wave functions at system sizes  close to the largest sizes accessible to exact diagonalization. \nOf course, it must be remembered that energy projection is an approximation, as we are throwing away components of the trial wave function at higher energies.\nFor reasonable trial wave functions we can hope that these components are small.\nIn the next sections we will investigate in some detail whether this is actually the case. \n\n\\section{Testing the projection}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n      Sphere & Torus\\\\\n\t\\includegraphics[width= {8.5cm}]{sphere_LaughlinVsd0_Overlap_Energy_f_N_10_3pane.pdf} \n\t&\n\t\\includegraphics[width= {8.5cm}]{torus_LaughlinVsd0_Overlap_Energy_f_N_10_3pane.pdf}       \n     \\end{tabular}\n\\caption{{\\small \n{\\bf Left Panels (Sphere):} Overlaps and variational energies for $N=10$ electrons on a sphere (full Hilbert space dimension  is of order $10^7$, after use of symmetries 319), using $1.2\\times 10^8$ MC samples.\\\\\n\\emph{Upper:} Exact and approximate (indicated by $d=0$) overlaps of the $ \\nu = 1/3$ Laughlin wave function with consecutive LLL-Coulomb eigenstates (with the Coulomb ground state on the left). \\\\\n\\emph{Middle:} Cumulative square overlap $f$ and energy estimate.

scheme, we find a number of low energy eigenstates of some reasonable hamiltonian (most commonly the Coulomb hamiltonian) acting within the LLL.\nWe then project the trial wave function onto this set of low energy states.\nThe idea is that for any reasonable trial wave function, we will find nearly the entire projection onto the LLL using a number of eigenstates of the hamiltonian which is very small compared to the size of the LLL.\nBefore we analyze whether this approach really works, a rough analysis of the computation time involved is useful.\nParticularly, we should compare the time it takes to calculate the energy\nprojection of a state to the time taken to calculate the exact projection. \n\nWe will assume that the real space form of the trial wave function $\\psi$ before LLL-projection can be easily calculated.\nThe exact LLL-projection of $\\psi$ can then be found by calculating its overlaps $\\left\\langle {\\phi_{\\vec{n}}} | {\\psi} \\right\\rangle$ with the Fock states $\\phi_{\\vec{n}}$ labeled by the occupation numbers $\\vec{n}$ of the LLL-orbitals.\nCalculation of these overlaps can be done by Monte Carlo integration.\nThe number of orbitals in the LLL equals $N_{\\Phi}$ (up to small geometry dependent corrections) and hence for a fermionic system, the number of Fock states spanning the LLL is $\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nThe evaluation of a single Fock state (using Gaussian elimination to evaluate the determinant) scales as $N^3$, where $N$ is the number of particles.\nIf we denote by $N_{MC}$ the average number of evaluations per Fock state

with $N$.\nWave functions for strongly interacting systems tend to have nonzero overlaps of comparable size with a significant fraction of the Fock states in the LLL.\nHence, if we define $f=|\\left\\langle {\\psi} | {P_{LLL}\\psi} \\right\\rangle|^2$, then the Monte Carlo integration has to resolve overlaps of typical size $\\sqrt{f/\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}}$.\nThis means that the allowable error on a given overlap should also be very small.\nIn fact, if the typical error on the overlaps is $\\epsilon$, then if we are very optimistic and take the errors on the overlaps to be independent of each other, we expect an overall error on the projection of $\\psi$ which is of order $\\sqrt{\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}}\\epsilon$.\nTo bring this back to something of order $\\sqrt{f}$, we require that $\\epsilon\\sim \\sqrt{f/\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}}$.\nThe statistical error in the Monte Carlo integration will normally be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of independent Monte Carlo samples generated, and we expect that the number of independent samples will be (at most) of order $\\frac{N_{MC}}{N}$.\nHence for the desired accuracy, we require that $N_{MC}\\sim N\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}/f$.\nThis yields an (optimistic) estimate of the scaling of computation effort for exact LLL-projection as $f^{-1}N^4 \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}^2$. \n\nClearly, this is problematic in studying large systems.\nNevertheless naively, it would seem that obtaining exact states for comparison to these trial states may be even more onerous, as numerical diagonalization scales naively as the third power the Hilbert space dimension, \\ie $\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}^3$.\nIn practice however, the hamiltonians of interest are relatively sparse, usually have a high degree of symmetry and we are normally only interested in a small number of low lying eigenstates.\nAs a result, the LLL-projection of the trial wave functions as described here nearly always becomes impossible at system sizes considerably smaller than those accessible to exact diagonalization methods. \n\nNow consider the computational effort needed to perform energy projection.\nWe will assume first of all that we can get a good approximation of the exact\nprojection using the lowest $M$ eigenstates of the chosen hamiltonian.\nHere $M$ should be a number that does not grow quickly with $N$, in particular, $M\\ll \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nWe will ignore the computational effort needed to obtain the $M$ lowest eigenstates of the hamiltonian -- we will usually work at system sizes where this is not the bottleneck of the computation.\nThe energy projection is simply the projection onto the $M$-dimensional\nsubspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the $M$ lowest eigenstates.\nIt involves calculating the overlaps $\\left\\langle {i} | {\\psi} \\right\\rangle$, where $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$, $i\\in\\{1,...M\\}$ labels the lowest $M$ eigenstates of the hamiltonian.\nEach state $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$ involves up to $\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$ Fock states. Hence a single evaluation of the state $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$ in real space takes effort of order $N^3\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nOnce the Fock states have all been evaluated, we can keep their values (subject to memory constraints) and use them to evaluate the other $M-1$ eigenstates of the hamiltonian.\nEvaluation of the $M$ overlaps needed for the energy projection then takes effort of order $(N^3 +M-1)\\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N} N'_{MC}$, where $N'_{MC}$ is the average number of evaluations of the states $\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle$ needed to get good Monte Carlo estimates of the overlaps.\nThe main advantage of energy projection is that the individual overlaps involved should now be much larger than the overlaps with individual Fock states.\nWe now expect the average overlap to be $\\sqrt{f/M}$ and to get the error on the projection of $\\psi$ to be of order $\\sqrt{f}$, we will need $N'_{MC}\\sim N M/f$, giving an estimate for the total computational effort involved in energy projection as $f^{-1}M N (N^3 + M-1) \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$.\nThis is clearly much better scaling than exact projection, as long as $M\\ll  \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$ and $M<N^3$ which usually the case, or in any event if  $M^2\\ll  \\binom{N_{\\Phi}}{N}$. \nThis scaling can be further improved if the trial wave function is an eigenstate of some symmetry of the hamiltonian, because in that case, we only need to consider overlaps with eigenstates with the same symmetry, reducing $M$.  \nIt turns out that energy projection usually allows us to work with trial wave functions at system sizes  close to the largest sizes accessible to exact diagonalization. \nOf course, it must be remembered that energy projection is an approximation, as we are throwing away components of the trial wave function at higher energies.\nFor reasonable trial wave functions we can hope that these components are small.\nIn the next sections we will investigate in some detail whether this is actually the case. \n\n\\section{Testing the projection}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n      Sphere & Torus\\\\\n\t\\includegraphics[width= {8.5cm}]{sphere_LaughlinVsd0_Overlap_Energy_f_N_10_3pane.pdf} \n\t&\n\t\\includegraphics[width= {8.5cm}]{torus_LaughlinVsd0_Overlap_Energy_f_N_10_3pane.pdf}       \n     \\end{tabular}\n\\caption{{\\small \n{\\bf Left Panels (Sphere):} Overlaps and variational energies for $N=10$ electrons on a sphere (full Hilbert space dimension  is of order $10^7$, after use of symmetries 319), using $1.2\\times 10^8$ MC samples.\\\\\n\\emph{Upper:} Exact and approximate (indicated by $d=0$) overlaps of the $ \\nu = 1/3$ Laughlin wave function with consecutive LLL-Coulomb eigenstates (with the Coulomb ground state on the left). \\\\\n\\emph{Middle:} Cumulative square overlap $f$ and energy estimate.

we test whether the energy projection is stable against changing the hamiltonian.\nFor the energy projection to be generically useful, its success should not depend crucially on which hamiltonian is used.\nWhile the low energy sector of the hamiltonian should capture the state that is being projected, the detailed structure of the low energy states should not be important.\n We would expect that hamiltonians with completely different ground states should be viable, as long as they incorporate \\eg repulsive interactions between the particles.    \n\nHere, we compare the energy projection using the lowest LL and second LL Coulomb hamiltonians obtained by extracting pseudopotentials a la Haldane\\cite{Haldane83} from the real space Coulomb hamiltonian using the lowest and second LL orbital wave functions.\n It is well known that these hamiltonians provide a completely different set of ground states at most accessible values of the flux and electron number.\n In particular, $\\psi_{L}$ is an excellent trial wave function for the ground state of the LLL but not for the second LL Coulomb hamiltonian, where it has squared overlap of order at most $0.4$ with the ground state for systems of up to $15$ particles\\cite{Ambrumenil88,Balram13}.\n  Significant efforts have recently been made to determine whether the ground state of the SLL Coulomb hamiltonian even represents the same topological order as the Laughlin wave function\\cite{Zaletel15,Johri14,Balram13} and there is also recent work on alternative wave functions which may improve the overlap\\cite{Jeong16}. \nIn addition to $\\psi_{L}$ we show the $d=1$, $d=2$ and $d=6$ (torus) and $d=7$ (sphere) modified Laughlin states introduced in {Eq.~\\eqref{{eq:alt-L_basic}}}.\nExplicit expressions for the modified wave functions on the sphere and torus are given in \\eqref{eq:Mod_Laughlin_Sphere} and {Eq.~\\eqref{{eq:Mod_Laughlin_Torus}}}.\n Note that these $d\\neq0$ wave functions are not entirely contained within the LLL so the energy projection is not redundant for these.\n\n\n\nIn {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:LLL_v_SLL_torus_d_0126_f}}} we show results for $N_e=6$ particles\non the torus (right panels, the small system size is chosen for illustrative\npurposes) and for $N_e=10$ particles on a sphere (left panels). \nThe upper panels in each subfigure again show the overlap for the $n$:th eigenstates and the lower panels show the cumulative content $f$ for the LLL (red) and SLL (blue) hamiltonians.\n Looking first at $d=0$ (or $\\psi_L$, upper panels) we see that, just as in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:d_0_Ef}}}, the LLL overlap falls off rapidly with increasing $n$ and that $f$ converges to good precision with only a few terms.\nComparing this to the SLL hamiltonian (blue), we see that the SLL ground state\nand $\\psi_L$ have a small overlap (zero within error on the torus and squared overlap of less than $0.4$ on the sphere).\nOn the other hand, practically all of $\\psi_L$ is still captured by the low energy states.\nIn the toroidal system, after including as little as $n=15$ states (out of a\ntotal of $1038$ states with the same total momentum), projection using the LLL and SLL hamiltonians both give $f=1$ to within $10^{-3}$.\n The spherical system also clearly gives projections from the two hamiltonians which are in close agreement, although at this system size more eigenstates of the SLL hamiltonian are needed. \n\nTurning our attention to $d=1$ (middle panels), we see qualitatively the same behavior.\nHowever -- as for all $d\\neq0$ -- the modified Laughlin wave functions are not contained within the LLL anymore,\nso $f<1$ and we find limiting values of $f\\approx0.8$ (torus) and $f\\approx0.74$ (sphere). \nNevertheless, it is clear from the figures that the energy projection still works, both with the LLL hamiltonian and with the SLL hamiltonian, as the $c_i$ decrease with $n$ and the low lying $c_i$ are still large enough to be accurately determined.\nIf the LLL content of the unprojected wave function is very small, then the accuracy will also be reduced as the smaller $c_j$ incur larger  relative errors in the MC-projection.\n Nevertheless, it is still possible to extract perfectly viable energy projections for considerably higher values of $d$. \\Eg the lower left panel shows the $d=6$ system on the torus, where $f$ is only about $0.12$ and the lower right panel shows the $d=7$ system on the sphere, with $f\\approx0.022$.\nBoth of these panels show that the SLL hamiltonian is more competitive with the LLL hamiltonian at larger values of $d$.\nFor the $d=6$ torus state, the SLL hamiltonian actually manages to capture the LLL content faster than the LLL hamiltonian at larger $n$.\nIn fact $f^{(\\mathrm{SLL})}_n\\gtrsim f^{(\\mathrm{LLL})}_n$ for $3<n<10$, which shows that it is not always best to have good overlap with the ground state,\nsince it may sacrifice weight in the other low energy states and lead to a lower value of the total weight $f$.\n For the $d=7$ system on the sphere, the LLL hamiltonian wins out over the SLL hamiltonian throughout,\n but we can nevertheless observe that the overlaps are considerably closer than at $d=0$ or $d=1$. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n      Sphere & Torus\\\\\n    \\includegraphics[width=

in all {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:LLL_v_SLL_torus_d_0126_f}}} shows that the energy projection method is stable to appreciable changes of the projecting hamiltonian as long as the low energy content is preserved and the state has reasonable weight in the LLL.\nWe can also comment briefly on the suitability of the modified Laughlin wave functions as improved trial wave functions for the $\\nu=7/3$ quantum Hall plateau.\n We find that the overlap with the ground state of the $SLL$ Coulomb hamiltonian on the sphere does improve when $d>0$ (as compared to $d=0$), but the improvement is not spectacular.\n The highest overlap we obtained was $0.603(2)$ for a system of $N=10$ particles on a sphere at $d=7$ (shown in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:d_1_d_2_Ef}}}).\n On the torus the overlap is always found to be zero within error, which appears to signal that  the ground state of the SLL hamiltonian is in a different $C_4$ symmetry sector from that of the LLL hamiltonian.\n\nNext we examine the speed of convergence for modified Laughlin states, as well as the LLL--content $f$ of these states, using the LLL Coulomb hamiltonian. \nResults for the limiting value of $f$ as a function of $d$ and $N$ are shown in figure~{FIG.~\\ref{{fig:LLL_content_vs_d_N}}}. \nAs expected, the value of $f$ decreases both with increasing $N$ and with increasing $d$.\n However, this decrease is perhaps not as fast as might be naively expected, with appreciable LLL--content still remaining even at the largest system sizes probed, especially at low values of $d$.\n Results on the convergence of $f$ and of the variational energy for $d=1$ and $d=2$ with $N=10$ electrons are shown in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:d_1_d_2_Ef}}}. \nOn the sphere (left panels), both $f$ and the energy stabilize very quickly at $f\\approx0.74$ for $d=1$ and $f\\approx0.425$ for $d=2$.\nSimilarly, on the torus, we find $f\\approx0.72$ for $d=1$ and $f\\approx0.397$\nfor $d=2$. Table \\ref{tab:convergence} shows how fast the energy estimate\nand cumulative overlap converges for $d=1$ and $d=2$.

$E_L$ and $f=1$ are included.\nSince $f_n$ measures the $LLL$ content, it increases monotonically with $n$ and\nsaturates quickly for $n \\ll N$ (note that these panels do not use a logarithmic

we test whether the energy projection is stable against changing the hamiltonian.\nFor the energy projection to be generically useful, its success should not depend crucially on which hamiltonian is used.\nWhile the low energy sector of the hamiltonian should capture the state that is being projected, the detailed structure of the low energy states should not be important.\n We would expect that hamiltonians with completely different ground states should be viable, as long as they incorporate \\eg repulsive interactions between the particles.    \n\nHere, we compare the energy projection using the lowest LL and second LL Coulomb hamiltonians obtained by extracting pseudopotentials a la Haldane\\cite{Haldane83} from the real space Coulomb hamiltonian using the lowest and second LL orbital wave functions.\n It is well known that these hamiltonians provide a completely different set of ground states at most accessible values of the flux and electron number.\n In particular, $\\psi_{L}$ is an excellent trial wave function for the ground state of the LLL but not for the second LL Coulomb hamiltonian, where it has squared overlap of order at most $0.4$ with the ground state for systems of up to $15$ particles\\cite{Ambrumenil88,Balram13}.\n  Significant efforts have recently been made to determine whether the ground state of the SLL Coulomb hamiltonian even represents the same topological order as the Laughlin wave function\\cite{Zaletel15,Johri14,Balram13} and there is also recent work on alternative wave functions which may improve the overlap\\cite{Jeong16}. \nIn addition to $\\psi_{L}$ we show the $d=1$, $d=2$ and $d=6$ (torus) and $d=7$ (sphere) modified Laughlin states introduced in {Eq.~\\eqref{{eq:alt-L_basic}}}.\nExplicit expressions for the modified wave functions on the sphere and torus are given in \\eqref{eq:Mod_Laughlin_Sphere} and {Eq.~\\eqref{{eq:Mod_Laughlin_Torus}}}.\n Note that these $d\\neq0$ wave functions are not entirely contained within the LLL so the energy projection is not redundant for these.\n\n\n\nIn {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:LLL_v_SLL_torus_d_0126_f}}} we show results for $N_e=6$ particles\non the torus (right panels, the small system size is chosen for illustrative\npurposes) and for $N_e=10$ particles on a sphere (left panels). \nThe upper panels in each subfigure again show the overlap for the $n$:th eigenstates and the lower panels show the cumulative content $f$ for the LLL (red) and SLL (blue) hamiltonians.\n Looking first at $d=0$ (or $\\psi_L$, upper panels) we see that, just as in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:d_0_Ef}}}, the LLL overlap falls off rapidly with increasing $n$ and that $f$ converges to good precision with only a few terms.\nComparing this to the SLL hamiltonian (blue), we see that the SLL ground state\nand $\\psi_L$ have a small overlap (zero within error on the torus and squared overlap of less than $0.4$ on the sphere).\nOn the other hand, practically all of $\\psi_L$ is still captured by the low energy states.\nIn the toroidal system, after including as little as $n=15$ states (out of a\ntotal of $1038$ states with the same total momentum), projection using the LLL and SLL hamiltonians both give $f=1$ to within $10^{-3}$.\n The spherical system also clearly gives projections from the two hamiltonians which are in close agreement, although at this system size more eigenstates of the SLL hamiltonian are needed. \n\nTurning our attention to $d=1$ (middle panels), we see qualitatively the same behavior.\nHowever -- as for all $d\\neq0$ -- the modified Laughlin wave functions are not contained within the LLL anymore,\nso $f<1$ and we find limiting values of $f\\approx0.8$ (torus) and $f\\approx0.74$ (sphere). \nNevertheless, it is clear from the figures that the energy projection still works, both with the LLL hamiltonian and with the SLL hamiltonian, as the $c_i$ decrease with $n$ and the low lying $c_i$ are still large enough to be accurately determined.\nIf the LLL content of the unprojected wave function is very small, then the accuracy will also be reduced as the smaller $c_j$ incur larger  relative errors in the MC-projection.\n Nevertheless, it is still possible to extract perfectly viable energy projections for considerably higher values of $d$. \\Eg the lower left panel shows the $d=6$ system on the torus, where $f$ is only about $0.12$ and the lower right panel shows the $d=7$ system on the sphere, with $f\\approx0.022$.\nBoth of these panels show that the SLL hamiltonian is more competitive with the LLL hamiltonian at larger values of $d$.\nFor the $d=6$ torus state, the SLL hamiltonian actually manages to capture the LLL content faster than the LLL hamiltonian at larger $n$.\nIn fact $f^{(\\mathrm{SLL})}_n\\gtrsim f^{(\\mathrm{LLL})}_n$ for $3<n<10$, which shows that it is not always best to have good overlap with the ground state,\nsince it may sacrifice weight in the other low energy states and lead to a lower value of the total weight $f$.\n For the $d=7$ system on the sphere, the LLL hamiltonian wins out over the SLL hamiltonian throughout,\n but we can nevertheless observe that the overlaps are considerably closer than at $d=0$ or $d=1$. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n  \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n      Sphere & Torus\\\\\n    \\includegraphics[width=

in all {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:LLL_v_SLL_torus_d_0126_f}}} shows that the energy projection method is stable to appreciable changes of the projecting hamiltonian as long as the low energy content is preserved and the state has reasonable weight in the LLL.\nWe can also comment briefly on the suitability of the modified Laughlin wave functions as improved trial wave functions for the $\\nu=7/3$ quantum Hall plateau.\n We find that the overlap with the ground state of the $SLL$ Coulomb hamiltonian on the sphere does improve when $d>0$ (as compared to $d=0$), but the improvement is not spectacular.\n The highest overlap we obtained was $0.603(2)$ for a system of $N=10$ particles on a sphere at $d=7$ (shown in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:d_1_d_2_Ef}}}).\n On the torus the overlap is always found to be zero within error, which appears to signal that  the ground state of the SLL hamiltonian is in a different $C_4$ symmetry sector from that of the LLL hamiltonian.\n\nNext we examine the speed of convergence for modified Laughlin states, as well as the LLL--content $f$ of these states, using the LLL Coulomb hamiltonian. \nResults for the limiting value of $f$ as a function of $d$ and $N$ are shown in figure~{FIG.~\\ref{{fig:LLL_content_vs_d_N}}}. \nAs expected, the value of $f$ decreases both with increasing $N$ and with increasing $d$.\n However, this decrease is perhaps not as fast as might be naively expected, with appreciable LLL--content still remaining even at the largest system sizes probed, especially at low values of $d$.\n Results on the convergence of $f$ and of the variational energy for $d=1$ and $d=2$ with $N=10$ electrons are shown in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:d_1_d_2_Ef}}}. \nOn the sphere (left panels), both $f$ and the energy stabilize very quickly at $f\\approx0.74$ for $d=1$ and $f\\approx0.425$ for $d=2$.\nSimilarly, on the torus, we find $f\\approx0.72$ for $d=1$ and $f\\approx0.397$\nfor $d=2$. Table \\ref{tab:convergence} shows how fast the energy estimate\nand cumulative overlap converges for $d=1$ and $d=2$.

In other geometries these states would all have\nnon-zero overlap and could contain important information on the\nreconstruction of the state being projected.\n\nMany other tests of the energy projection could be devised.\n Most obviously one may apply it to other classes of well known wave functions.\n We have done this for example for a number of composite fermion or hierarchy states and the results are qualitatively similar to those for the (modified) Laughlin wave functions.\n One may also calculate the overlap of the unprojected trial wave function with high energy eigenstates of the hamiltonian, to make sure no important components of the LLL-projection at high energy are missed.\n Clearly for large systems this can only be done for a number of eigenstates that is much smaller than Hilbert space dimension, so one would need to have an idea where to look for the potential missing overlap.\n Generally one would observe the behavior for smaller systems to see if there is such high energy overlap and hope that, if there is none, it does not appear in large systems either.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n  Sphere & Torus\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width= {8.5cm}]{sphere_ModifiedLaughlin_LLL_CoulombGSOverlap.pdf}&\n\\includegraphics[width= {8.5cm}]{torus_ModifiedLaughlin_LLL_CoulombGSOverlap_Inset.pdf}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{{\\small \nSquared overlap of the modified Laughlin states with the Coulomb ground state, as a function of $d$ and $N$ on the sphere (left) and torus (right).

functions}\n\nWe now turn from testing the energy projection\nto using it as a tool to analyze the modified Laughlin states as trial wave functions for the LLL Coulomb problem.\n  Since we will be working on the sphere and torus we give explicit expressions for the sphere and torus versions of the states below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then go on and study the variational energies and overlaps with the exact Coulomb ground state as a function of $d$ and $N$, as well as two-point correlation functions and entanglement spectra.\n We will find that by letting $1<d<2$, we can significantly improve on the $d=0$ Laughlin wave function.\n\nThe explicit form of the modified Laughlin wave functions on the sphere are obtained by directly generalizing the planar wave function from {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Girvin84}}} to the spherical geometry {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Haldane83}}}.\nThe wave functions on the sphere are \n\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n

\\eqref{eq:Mod_Laughlin_Torus} are the same as those of the planar version in \\eqref{eq:CF_basic}.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Coulomb overlap}\n\nWe start by considering the overlap with the Coulomb ground state as a function of $d$ and $N$.\n In {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:ground_state_overlap_scaling}}} this is shown for both the sphere (left) and torus (right).\nThe main feature of interest is that the overlap of the standard Laughlin state is systematically improved for all system sizes by tuning $d>0$.\n Values of $d$ between $d=1$ and $d=2$ give the best overlap with the Coulomb ground state.\n While the optimal value of $d$ is not completely independent of system size,\n this dependence is weak (especially on the sphere) and we note that near the optimal value of $d$ the overlap decreases only very slowly with increasing system size.\n For values of $d$ with lower overlaps (and notably for the standard Laughlin wave function at $d=0$), the overlap also decreases much faster with system size.\n The optimal squared overlap is above $0.998$ on the torus for all system sizes considered (up to $N=10$).\n On the sphere the system sizes go even to $N=11$ and we still obtain optimal squared overlap of $0.999$.\n\nNote that these figures show results for many fractional values of $d$.\nThat we are able to project wave functions that have a fractional value of $d$ is a powerful feature of the energy projection method.\nIn many other methods this kind of projection would be difficult as it would be unclear how to handle fractional powers on the Jastrow factors.\nHere the projection is no more difficult than that of integer $d$, and the only extra effort lies in generating the unprojected wave functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Variational energy}\n\n\n\nAnother measure of the quality of a trial ground state is its variational energy.\nResults for the variational energy of the modified Laughlin states for various values of $d$ and $N$ are shown in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:energy_scaling}}}.\nThe energy per particle is plotted against $1/N$ to detect scaling behavior for $N\\rightarrow \\infty$.\nTo obtain the correct scaling we perform the usual background subtractions and density corrections on the sphere (see \\eg {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Jain_CF}}}, appendix I) and background subtractions on the torus\\cite{Yoshioka83,Bonsall59}.\n\nOn the sphere we find energies lower than that of the Laughlin state in the region $0<d<3$ (for all $N$).\nThe minimal energies at these finite system sizes are found around $d=1.3$.\nThe energies for $0<d<3$ appear to be in a scaling region for systems from size $N=7$ upwards, enabling an attempt at computing the thermodynamic ground state energy density.\nFor the modified Laughlin state at $d=1.3$ we thus obtain a variational energy per particle $E_{d=1.3}=-0.410149(6)$.\nThis should be compared to the scaled Coulomb energy at $E_C=-0.410179(3)$ and the scaled Laughlin energy at $E_L=-0.40984(1)$.\nLimiting values of the variational energy for other values of $d$ are given in the figure. \nThe reported errors give one standard deviation, and only reflect the uncertainty that comes from MC estimation and the linear fit.\nThis leaves out effects from the cutoff in energy eigenstates used in the projection and more importantly any finite size effects which may still occur at larger system sizes.\nNevertheless, it is clear that the modified Laughlin state at $d=1.3$ has an excess energy which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the standard Laughlin state at all finite sizes considered and we expect this will continue to be true at larger sizes.\n\nOn the torus, finite size effects are larger and we have not performed fits of the energy for $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, except for the Coulomb and standard Laughlin states, which we calculated out to larger sizes than the energy projected modified Laughlin states.\nBecause the points jump around more we have only included $d=1$, $d=3$ and $d=5$ results in this plot, to keep it readable.\nNevertheless, the general picture is more or less the same as on the sphere, in that modified Laughlin states with $1<d<2$ can very significantly reduce the variational energy from that of the standard Laughlin wave function at all system sizes examined.\nFor example at $N=10$, the energy obtained for $d=1.3$ is $E_{d=1.3}=-0.41061$ as compared to the Coulomb energy at $E_C=-0.41063$ and the Laughlin energy of $E_L=-0.4104$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n  Sphere &

{FIG.~\\ref{{fig:GS_energy_scan_of_d}}}, we show the variational energy on the sphere (left) and torus (right) as a function of $d$, for $N=10$ (upper panels).\nIt is clear that the energy is a smooth function of $d$ which is very well fit by a low order polynomial.\nWe use the value of $d$ where this fit takes its minimum as a good estimate for the optimal $d$ at a given $N$.\nThese optimal values of $d$ were plotted against $1/N$ (lower panels) to get an idea of the best possible value of $d$ in the thermodynamic limit.\nOn the sphere there is again what appears to be excellent scaling behavior from $N=7$ upwards, leading to an estimated limit value $d_{\\infty}=1.487\\pm 0.009$. On the torus, finite size effects again appear larger, but a linear scaling fit can still be attempted leading in this case to $d_{\\infty}=1.655\\pm 0.12$.\nAgain, the errors on these numbers represent a single standard deviation and do not take into account finite size effects which may manifest when considering larger sizes.\nIt is encouraging that there appears to be proper scaling behavior of $d$, as this supports the idea that $d$ is a physical parameter of the system in the thermodynamic limit. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n  Sphere &

Girvin and Jach\\cite{Girvin84} to introduce the modified Laughlin wave functions was that a nonzero $d$ would ``discourage close encounters of the particles\".\nWhile this seems obvious for the unprojected wave function, it is less obvious after projection.\nFor example we may observe that the planar wave functions (\\ref{eq:alt-L_basic}) are all the same for $N=2$ (after projection).\nAlso, our results on the variational energy show that while close encounters may be discouraged for $1<d<3$, this is not so clear for large $d$, where the variational energy increases again.\n\nTo directly investigate the matter we have calculated the $2$-particle correlation functions of the modified Laughlin states. \n\nCorrelation functions are shown in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:correlation}}} both for the sphere (left panels)  and for the torus (right panels). \nThe correlation  function on the sphere depends only on the distance between the particles.\nWe can think of it as a density plot for a system with one particle fixed at the north pole.\nThe plot for the (square) torus has the first particle fixed at $z=0$ and is showing a diagonal cut to $z=\\frac{1+i}2L$ (the diametrically opposed point of the square),\nwith a density plot of the full 2D correlation function in the inset.\nIn the upper panels of the figures, the correlations for the unprojected wave functions are shown as dashed lines for $d\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$.\nIn these plots we see two very clear trends with increasing $d$:\nthe correlation hole around $z=0$ widens, showing directly that close encounters are discouraged before projection,\nand the oscillations at larger distances increase, showing increasing signs of the local onset of crystallization. \nWe note that the wave length of the oscillations appears to be fairly independent of $d$ and is approximately $1.5\\ell_B$.\nThe correlation functions after projection are shown as solid lines in the same figures.\nWe see that almost the entire effect observed before projection is reversed.\nThis is likely due to the fact that the basis functions of the LLL only allow particles to be localized to within about a magnetic length,\nwhich limits the sharpness of any peaks in the correlation function.\nIn order to see the remaining modifications clearly,\nwe plot the difference between the correlation functions for the same $d$'s and the standard Laughlin wave function in the lower panels,\nas well as the difference between the correlation function for the Coulomb ground state and the Laughlin state.\nWe see that the remaining effects still echo the effects observed before projection.\nAs $d$ increases the correlation functions have increasing oscillatory behavior at the same wave length as before projection.\nThe widening of the correlation hole is now seen to be simply part of this oscillatory behavior.\nOn the sphere we note that the strongest effects of the modification are at longer distances with the correlation hole less affected.\nNote that the use of chord length in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:correlation}}}, instead of arc length,\nmakes the oscillations at larger $r_{12}$ on the sphere appear to have shorter wavelength than is actually the case.\nWe also see, in good agreement with what we know from the overlap and energy,\nthat the best fit to the Coulomb correlation function lies somewhere in between $d=1$ and $d=2$.\nThe Coulomb ground state clearly has stronger long range oscillations than $\\psi_L$,\nwhich fits with intuition, since $\\psi_{L}$ is the ground state of an ultra short ranged interaction,\nwhile the Coulomb interaction is long ranged.\nWe can think of the introduction of a nonzero $d$ as a way to reintroduce these longer range oscillations. \n\nFor the sphere we have also added the curve for $g_{d=1.3}$.\nWe see that for small $r$ then $g_{d=1.3}\\approx g_C$ to very good accuracy,\nespecially at shorter distances, where the difference is imperceptible in the plot. \nAt the longest distances, $g_C$ is closer to $g_{d=2}$.\nPerhaps this is related to the fact that $d$ drifts towards $1.5$ at large $N$, where longer distances can be probed.\nFinally, we note that while close encounters may be discouraged for $1<d<3$, For large d, the correlation functions start to show an increased probability to find pairs of particles at a distance of approximately $1$ magnetic length (where each particle would\nbe inside the other's ``correlation hole'').\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{cc}\n      \\includegraphics[width=

the entanglement spectrum\\cite{Li08} (ES) of the modified Laughlin states, using the orbital cut introduced in {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Haque07}}}.\nThe entanglement spectrum is a powerful tool for the determination of the topological order of gapped systems.\nFor Hall states, the low lying part of the ES of a system on the sphere often resembles the spectrum of the chiral conformal field theory (CFT) describing the modes propagating along the circular edge of the corresponding state on a disk\\cite{Li08}. \n\nFor Hall systems on the torus, the ES will resemble the edge spectrum on a cylinder, where the edge consists of two circles governed by counterpropagating versions of the same chiral CFT\\cite{Lauchli10}.\nThe Laughlin state has the special property that \\emph{all} states in its orbital ES correspond to states in its edge CFT.\nThe ES of the exact Coulomb ground state on the other hand has a clearly identifiable low lying branch corresponding to the ES of the Laughlin state, but in addition has many other states in higher branches.\nThese states can be attributed to components of the Coulomb ground state which can be thought of as neutral bulk excitations of the Laughlin state\\cite{Sterdyniak11_NewJPhys}. \n\nIn {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:ES_sphere}}} we show the orbital ES of a number of systems of $N=10$ particles on a sphere.\nIn all four panels, we show the ES of the Coulomb ground state (blue dashes) with superimposed on it the ES of the energy projected state (red crosses).\nThe top left figure shows the ES of the Laughlin state as determined from its energy projection (we can think of it as the $d=0$ state).\nWe clearly see from the graph that the Laughlin state indeed reproduces the lowest branch of the Coulomb ES but not the higher ones.\nWe also see that at values of the entanglement energy $\\xi$ above $20$ there are many spurious states in the $d=0$ ES which would not appear if we had used the exact Laughlin state rather than its energy projection.\nThese states appear purely due to the error of the energy projection.\nThe scale at which they first appear can in principle be shifted upward by taking more MC samples.\nIt is clear that with the amount of MC samples we have taken here, states with $\\xi>20$ can be safely discarded as noise and we have therefore cut off the scale at this level in the other panels of {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:ES_sphere}}}.\nIn the upper right panel, we consider the ES of the $d=0.5$ modified Laughlin state.\nWe see that there is still a good fit to the $d=0$ branch of the ES but additional branches of states are swooping down from above as a result of setting $d>0$.\nIn the bottom left panel we consider $d=1.3$ which gives more or less the optimal fit to the Coulomb energy as well as the highest overlap at this system size.\nWe see that the branches of the ES have now settled very closely to the location where they are in the Coulomb ES.\nThe fit of the low lying ES (in the Laughlin branch) is also noticeably improved for $d=1.3$\nfor entanglement energies up to $\\xi\\approx10$.\n While the detailed positioning of the individual levels within the higher branches does not always match very well, we stress that the structure of these branches,\n\\ie the counting of levels at each angular momentum, is identical to that of the Coulomb ES, even though this may not always be obvious from the plot.\nWe also notice that while the overall trend in raising $d$ has been to bring levels down out of the noise, there are some exceptions at low angular momentum, where the entanglement energies of some levels have risen from values below to values above those of the Coulomb ES.\nThese trends continue for higher values of $d$.\nThe ES for $d=5$ is shown in the bottom right panel.\nEven at $d=5$ the lower part of the Laughlin branch of the ES is still mostly in place, except for some levels at low angular momentum which seem to have migrated up into the noise.\nOn the other hand the higher branches visible at large angular momenta have now all descended well below the corresponding Coulomb branches.   \n\nEntanglement spectra for $N=10$ electrons on the torus are shown {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:ES_torus}}}.\nIn the left panel we again compare the energy projected $d=0$ state to the exact Laughlin state to give an idea of the Monte Carlo noise on the data for the modified Laughlin wave functions. Any disagreement between the $d=0$ and exact Laughlin states' ES is due to the error in the determination of the $d=0$ state, which would be exactly equal to the Laughlin state if this error was zero. We see that the noise in the ES in this case becomes severe above entanglement energy $\\xi\\approx 12$. This more severe noise, as compared to the sphere ES, is due to the fact that the data is based on fewer MC samples. \nIn the middle panel, we show the exact Laughlin ES superimposed on the ES for the exact Coulomb ground state.\nAs on the sphere, there is good matching of the low lying levels, but many\nhigher lying levels from $\\xi\\approx 8$ upwards are completely missing from the\nLaughlin ES. In the right hand panel, we show the ES for $d=1.5$, which is close\nto optimal.  We find that all levels in the Coulomb ES are now reproduced with\nexcellent matching of the entanglement energies. The entanglement energies\nobtained for levels that were already present in the Coulomb ES is also visibly\nimproved.  Overall, the ES for the torus shows similar feature to those for the sphere.\nAs $d$ is increased, levels which come from the higher branches of the Coulomb ES come down.\nThere is also a tendency for levels that are far from the center of the conformal towers of states to be shifted up, which is analogous to the shifting up of high angular momentum states on the sphere.   \n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\n\nWe have introduced the energy projection (EP) as a method for projecting quantum Hall trial wave functions to the lowest Landau level.\nIn effect we replace the LLL projection by projection onto the low lying spectrum of a suitable hamiltonian acting in the LLL, carefully checking convergence of this projection to what should be the full LLL projection.\nThe method works well for all states we have considered, up to system sizes where a few hundred states are accessible by exact diagonalization.\nWe have shown this here in some detail for the Laughlin state and for the modified Laughlin states proposed by Girvin and Jach in {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Girvin84}}}. \n\nWe have also applied EP to investigate the modified Laughlin states as trial wave functions for the Coulomb ground state at filling $\\nu=\\frac{1}{3}$.\nIt turns out that these states allow for significant improvements over the standard Laughlin state.\nFor example the squared overlap with the Coulomb ground state of a system of $N=11$ electrons on the sphere is improved from $\\sim0.98$ for the Laughlin state to $\\sim0.999$ for the modified state at $d=1.3$.\nOn the torus at $N=10$, there is a similar improvement from $\\sim0.97$ for the Laughlin state to values above $0.998$ for the modified states with $1.4<d<1.9$.\nThe variational energy per particle can also be improved from that of the Laughlin state at the finite sizes we considered and likely also in the thermodynamic limit as can be seen from the scaling results in {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:energy_scaling}}}.\nWe also investigated the two particle correlation functions of the modified states and found that, compared to the standard Laughlin state, the states at $d>0$ exhibit more pronounced medium range oscillations, which allows them to better mimic the Coulomb ground state.\nWhile close encounters of the particles are to some extent discouraged at $d>0$\n(as expected by Girvin and Jach), the much improved matching with the Coulomb\nground state's longer range oscillations is at least as striking. \nTurning to the entanglement spectrum, we find that introducing even a small nonzero $d$ brings forward the branches of the Coulomb ES at higher entanglement energies that are completely missing from the Laughlin ES.\nUsing the optimal values of $d$ allows for a very good qualitative fit of the entire Coulomb ES as well as a good quantitative fit at low entanglement energy. \n\nThere can be little argument that the modified Laughlin states describe the same universality class as the usual Laughlin state.\nAll observables we have calculated show very smooth behavior as a function of $d$.\nOf course we are limited to small system sizes, but, especially on the sphere, we appear to nevertheless reach the scaling region at least for the energy and for the optimal value of $d$ (see {FIG.~\\ref{{fig:GS_energy_scan_of_d}}}).\nThe entanglement spectra also show a stable low lying Laughlin type branch for a broad range of $d$-values. \n\nA natural extension of this work is a study of modified Laughlin states with excitations, such as quasiholes,\nquasiparticles and excitons.\nTrial wave functions for these can be constructed by applying modification factors similar to those in \\eqref{eq:alt-L_basic} to the Laughlin state with excitations.\nHowever, this is not the only possible way.\nOne may also introduce additional variational parameters modifying the quasihole profile or construct excitations using a CF construction based on reverse flux attachment (\\eg at $d=1$).\nWe can also consider different filling fractions, especially $\\nu=1/5$.\nEarly indications are that improvements over the Laughlin state similar to those at $\\nu=1/3$ can be obtained there but at substantially higher values of $d$.\nThe energy projection can be used to study all these possibilities and we intend to report on a number of them shortly\\cite{FremlingWIP}.\n\nThe fact that the energy projection is a controlled approximation allows one also to use it to test the Jain-Kamilla (JK) type projections used for numerical work on composite fermion and BS--hierarchy\\cite{Bonderson08} wave functions against exact projection for larger system sizes than were possible up to now.  We are in the process of doing this as part of a larger study of reverse flux CF wave functions\\cite{FulsebakkeWIP}.\n\n\nThe EP can also be used to evaluate the CF wave functions on the torus. Work on\nthese was recently done by Hermanns\\cite{Hermanns13_PRB} but the wave functions\ncould only be evaluated for a very small number of particles. Using EP the wave\nfunctions could be tested at larger system sizes.\nWe have some hope that the EP may also help alleviate computational difficulties other than the LLL-projection, notably explicit symmetrization and antisymmetrization of trial wave functions. \n\nOther ways to improve the Laughlin wave function include the fixed phase quantum Monte Carlo method of {Ref.~\\onlinecite{{Ortiz93}}}, which can find the optimal wave function when the phase of the function is given.\nIt would be interesting to compare the results from this method to the best results obtained using the single parameter family of states considered here, and also potentially to try and further improve the modified Laughlin states using this method.\nWe have checked by direct analytic calculation for small systems that the phase of the modified Laughlin wave functions does depend on $d$ and in particular that it is not the same as the phase of the standard Laughlin wave function. \nRecently there has been much interest also in modifications of Hall states (including the Laughlin state) by the introduction of geometric anisotropy\\cite{Haldane11,Qiu12,Yang12} and it would be interesting to generalize the modified Laughlin states to this context also. \n\nGoing beyond the Laughlin states, modifications similar to those in \\eqref{eq:alt-L_basic} can be made to any planar or spherical trial wave function.\nThis could thus be used to massage the CF wave functions of the Jain series, but can also be applied to more exotic wave functions such as \\eg the Moore-Read Pfaffian wave function\\cite{Moore91} at $\\nu=5/2$ or its generalizations such as the Read-Rezayi\\cite{Read99} or BS--hierarchy\\cite{Bonderson08} wave functions. \n\nThe modification made to the Laughlin wave functions can also be easily generalized. In fact, the modified Laughlin states are only the simplest type of modified states in a large class of wave functions which can be described uing Wen's $K$-matrix formalism\\cite{Wen92a}. For any such wave function, one may split the $K$-matrix into a chiral and an antichiral part, writing $K=\\kappa-\\bar{\\kappa}$, where $\\kappa$ and $\\bar{\\kappa}$ are both positive definite\\cite{Suorsa11_PRB,Suorsa11_NewJPhys,Hansson16}. For the Laughlin state at filling $\\nu=\\frac{1}{3}$, we simply have the $1\\times 1$ matrix $K=3$, with the modified states obtained using $\\kappa=3+d$ and $\\bar{\\kappa}=d$. For multi-layer states or states based on CF constructions with multiple Landau levels, the $K$-matrix will be higher dimensional and many more modifications become possible. States with counterpropagating edge modes  must be realized with nonzero $\\kappa$ and $\\bar{\\kappa}$ and in such cases the EP may be the only way to evaluate them at reasonable system sizes. Such non-chiral states would include for example the $\\nu=2/3$ state, especially on the torus where other approximate projection methods are not available.\n\n\\section{Computations}\n\\label{sec:computations} \nThis project entailed significant numerical computations using a mix of freely\navailable codes as well as codes developed in-house by the authors. \n\nA set of codes, christened Hammer\\footnote{Public release of Hammer in preparation.} were\ndeveloped by the authors and were used for the majority of the computations.\nThese codes have many notable features. They provide a diagonalisation code with\nthe ability to accurately resolve large numbers of eigenstates for large sparse\nmatrices by employing the Krylov subspace methods provided by SLEPc\n\\cite{Hernandez:2005:SSF} and taking advantage of large distributed memory\nmachines. This code can exploit many symmetries of the hamiltonian to reduce the\ncomputational effort and provide additional quantum numbers. It includes\nutilities to calculate many other quantities including entanglement spectra, \ncorrelation functions and Hall viscosities. There is a significant functionality\nfor performing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations on both the sphere and torus, with\nutilities that can efficiently evaluate many trial wave-functions.  \n\nThe DiagHam package \\footnote{http://nick-ux.lpa.ens.fr/diagham/wiki} is a freely available set of utilities for performing\ncalculations of FQH systems. This package was used for the following\ncomputations on the sphere: initial diagonalization calculations for small systems,\nreal space evaluation of Fock space wave-functions\nand the calculation of entanglement spectrum and correlation functions.\n\n\n\n\\vspace*{2mm}\n\\acknowledgments\n\\noindent \nWe thank Hans Hansson for pointing us in the direction of the modified Laughlin wave functions and Steve Simon for useful discussions.\nJKS thanks Nordita for its hospitality during the program on Physics of\nInterfaces and Layered Structures (2015), when part of this work was done.
