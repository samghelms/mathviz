Recently observed P13 system is an extra-galactic X-ray \nsource. This X-ray source is unique because it is the first ULX with the reliable mass \nestimate of compact object: apparently a stellar-origin black hole (Motch et al. 2014). \nPietrzynski et al. (2010) have determined distance to NGC7793 (P13 host galaxy) using \nCepheids from variable stars discovered in Wide-Field Imaging Survey. P13 is a high mass \nX-ray binary (HMXB) hosting a  stellar-origin black hole (5-15$\\MS$) in 64 day orbit \naround a massive (18-23$\\MS$) B9Ia star. The companion is in the mass range for neutron \nstar formation (Belczynski et al. 2008). We select this system to investigate a population \nof potential Gravitational Wave (GW) sources: Black Holes + Neutron Star (BH-NS) mergers. \nOver the past few years three studies have been published in which authors examined value \nof emipiral merger rate for BH-NS systems. In 2011, Belczynski et al. (2011) obtained the \nBH-NS merger rate of $\\sim$0.001 yr$^{-1}$ for Cyg X-1 system. In 2013, Belczynski et al.\n(2013) obtained the BH-NS empirical merger rate of$\\sim$0.1 yr$^{-1}$ for Cyg X-3 system. \nAnd in 2015, Grudzinska et al. (2015) calculated empirical BH-NS merger rate of \n$\\sim$0.2 yr$^{-1}$ for MWC 656 system. These systems host BHs with masses in range \n$5-15\\MS$ and companion stars with mass range from $7\\MS$ to $20\\MS$. P13 is therefore \nrather similar. \n\n\n\n\\section{ESTIMATES}\n\n\\subsection{The evolution of P13}\n\nTo investigate the future evolution of P13 system we employ the binary population \nsynthesis code, $\\textbf{StarTrack}$ (Belczynski et al. 2008a). We use average values  \nof estimated orbital parameters: $P_{\\rm orb} = 64d$ and eccentricity $e=0.34$. \nWe investigate three cases of binary configurations (dependent on component masses) which \nundergo different evolutionary paths. In case 1, binary system experiences only common \nenvelope phase (CE) while donor is a Hertzsprung gap star. In case 2, binary system \nexperiences only Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF) while donor is a Hertzsprung gap star. In \ncase 3, binary system experiences both CE and RLOF phase; CE is encountered while\ndonor is a Hertzsprung gap star and RLOF occurs while donor is a naked evolved Helium \nstar. \n\n{\\bf Case 1.}\nWe start evolutionary calculation, while the more massive star in binary has already \nformed a BH with mass $M_{\\rm BH} = 10\\MS$. This takes about 5 Myr. Therefore, we \nassume that the massive companion in P13 is a Main Sequence (MS) star that has already \nundergone significant nuclear burning and its mass is $M_{\\rm comp} = 25\\MS$.  \nFollowing observations we assume orbit with $P_{\\rm orb} = 64d$ ($a=220\\RS$) and \neccentricity $e=0.34$.\n\nAt $t=7.4$ Myr the companion evolves off MS. At this point companion star lost \n$\\sim0.7\\MS$ and orbit became wider ($P_{\\rm orb} = 66d$, $a=224\\RS$), but tidal\nforces were not able to reduce eccentricity ($e=0.34$).\n\nDuring Hertzsprung Gap (HG) phase the system undergoes CE phase. Here we treat CE phase \nwith standard energy balance (Webbink 1984). We assume the efficient conversion of orbital \nenergy into the envelope ejection ($\\alpha_{\\rm CE} = 1$). The binding energy of star \nenvelope is obtained with physical stellar models (binding energy parameter $\\lambda = \n0.05$; Dominik et al. 2012). During the CE phase part of envelope is accreted onto BH \n(it increases its mass from $10\\MS$ to $10.15\\MS$) and the rest is ejected from the binary \nsystem. Companion star loses a significant fraction of its mass $M_{\\rm comp} = 7.2\\MS$\nafter CE and becomes a massive helium core or Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. Orbital period\ndecays to just $P_{\\rm orb} = 0.24d$ ($a=4.2\\RS$) and becomes circular. \n\nAfter CE, from $t=7.4$ Myr to $t=8.38$ Myr the WR star wind is accreted onto BH and \nthe system enters HMXB phase. The WR star mass decreases to $6.15\\MS$ and\nin response $P_{\\rm orb} = 0.32d$ ($a=4.5\\RS$).\n\nEvolution ends at $t=8.38$ Myr with supernova explosion (SN) and NS formation: \n$M_{\\rm NS} = 1.56\\MS$. We adopt natal kicks with uniform distribution of orientations \nand with a 1D Maxwellian velocity distribution with $\\sigma$ = 265 km s$^{-1}$. This \ndistribution was measured for Galactic single pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005). Due to the \nfact that binary is on close orbit during the SN ($P_{\\rm orb} = 0.32d$, $a=4.5\\RS$) \nthe system has significant chance ($\\sim 38\\%$) to form close binary system which will \nmerge within Hubble time. During evolution the BH has accreted $\\Delta M = 0.15\\MS$. \nIf the birth BH spin was $a=0.0$, $0.5$, $0.9$ then it was increased to $a = 0.055$, \n$0.531$ and $0.909$, respectively. \n\n\n{\\bf Case 2.} \nWe start evolutionary calculation, while the more massive star in binary has already \nformed a BH with mass $M_{\\rm BH} = 15\\MS$. This takes about 4.49 Myr. Therefore, we \nassume that the massive companion in P13 is a MS star that has already \nundergone significant nuclear burning and its mass is $M_{\\rm comp} = 22.5\\MS$.  \nFollowing observations we assume orbit with $P_{\\rm orb} = 64d$ ($a=225\\RS$) and \neccentricity $e=0.34$.\n\nAt $t=8.28$ Myr companion star evolves off MS. At this point companion \nstar lost $\\sim0.5\\MS$ and orbit became wider ($P_{\\rm orb} = 65d$, $a=228\\RS$), but \ntidal forces were not able to reduce eccentricity $e=0.34$.\n\nDuring HG phase companion star expands and fills its Roche Lobe ($R_{\\rm 2} = R_{\\rm 2, lobe} = 63\\RS$) \nand the RLOF proceeds. This time due to less extreme mass ratio (as contrasted with \ncase 1) the mass transfer is stable (no CE evolution). RLOF starts at $t=8.29$ Myr \nand lasts about $0.005$ Myr. We assume non-conservative evolution throughout the \nRLOF with accretion onto BH Eddington limited. We assume that the lost material takes \naway angular momentum specific to the accretor. During the RLOF phase part of mass is \nacreted onto BH (it increases its mass from $15\\MS$ to $17.75\\MS$). Companion star mass \ndecreases from $22\\MS$ to $6.44\\MS$ and it becomes a massive helium core or WR star. \nOrbit period expands to $P_{\\rm orb} = 213d$ ($a=434\\RS$) and becomes circular.\n\nThe WR star mass decreases to $5.6\\MS$ ($P_{\\rm orb} = 328d$, $a=571\\RS$) due to \nintensive wind mass loss. Evolution ends at $t=9.32$ Myr with SN and NS formation: \n$M_{\\rm NS} = 1.46\\MS$. Due to the fact that binary is on wide orbit during the SN \n($P_{\\rm orb} = 328d$, $a=571\\RS$) the system has only a small chance ($\\sim 0.01\\%$) \nto form close binary system which will merge within Hubble time. During evolution \nthe BH has accreted a total of $\\Delta M = 2.75\\MS$. If the birth BH spin was $a=0.0$, \n$0.5$, $0.9$ then it was increased to $a = 0.487$, $0.771$ and $0.97$, respectively. \n\n{\\bf Case 3.}\nWe start evolutionary calculation, while the more massive star in binary has already \nformed a BH with mass $M_{\\rm BH} = 10\\MS$. This takes about 5 Myr. Therefore, we \nassume that the massive companion in P13 is a MS star that has already \nundergone significant nuclear burning and its mass is $M_{\\rm comp} = 22.5\\MS$.  \nWe assume orbit with $P_{\\rm orb} = 64d$ ($a=214\\RS$) and $e=0.34$.\n\nAt $t=8.28$ Myr the companion evolves off MS. At this point companion star lost \n$\\sim0.5\\MS$ and orbit became wider ($P_{\\rm orb} = 66d$, $a=217\\RS$) with \n$e=0.34$.\n\nDuring HG phase the system undergoes CE phase. During the CE phase part of envelope is \naccreted onto BH (it increases its mass from $10\\MS$ to $10.17\\MS$) and the rest is \nejected from the binary system. Companion star loses a significant fraction of its \nmass $M_{\\rm comp} = 6.31\\MS$ after CE and becomes a massive WR star. Orbital period\nreduces to just $P_{\\rm orb} = 0.24d$ ($a=4.2\\RS$) and the orbit becomes circular.\n\nNext, the WR star mass decreases to $5.37\\MS$ due to wind mass loss and in response \norbit changes to $P_{\\rm orb} = 0.27d$ ($a=4.4\\RS$). At $t=9.32$ Myr WR star expands \nslightly and fills its Roche Lobe ($R_{\\rm 2} = R_{\\rm 2, lobe} = 1.45\\RS$). \nThe stable RLOF lasts about $0.001$ Myr. During the RLOF phase part of mass is acreted \nonto BH (it increases its mass from $10.17\\MS$ to $10.47\\MS$). WR star mass decreases \nfrom $5.37\\MS$ to $3.93\\MS$. Orbit period expands to $P_{\\rm orb} = 0.61d$ ($a=6.95\\RS$).\n\nEvolution ends at $t=9.33$ Myr (just after RLOF) with SN and NS formation: $M_{\\rm NS} = 1.45\\MS$. \nDue to the fact that binary is on close orbit during the SN ($P_{\\rm orb} = 0.61d$, \n$a=6.95\\RS$) the system has significant chance ($\\sim 22\\%$) to form close binary system \nwhich will merge within Hubble time. During evolution the BH has accreted $\\Delta \nM = 0.47\\MS$. If the birth BH spin was $a=0.0$, $0.5$, $0.9$ then it was increased \nto $a = 0.15$, $0.59$ and $0.92$, respectively.\n\n\n\\subsection{Rate Estimates}\n\nP13 has been observed because of its unusually strong X-ray emission. Such systems are X-ray \nactive as long as evolution of the secondary component has not come to the end and it can feed \nmass to a compact object. Entire evolution of the secondary object lasts for about 9 Myr \n(e.g., case 3). We employ this as the upper limit, i.e. conservative estimate for the BH-NS \ndetection rate. More reliable estimate for X-ray phase is only 4 Myr (since it takes about \n5 Myr to form BH). Such reduced estimate would have resulted in higher (by factor of $\\sim 2$) \ndetection rate.\n\nDistance within which LIGO/VIRGO can detect GW from a given source (e.g. BH-NS merger) is \ngiven by\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{1}\nd_{\\rm dco} = d_{\\rm 0} \\bigg(\\frac{M_{\\rm c,dco}}{M_{\\rm c,nsns}}\\bigg)^{5/6},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"d_{\\rm dco}=d_{\\rm 0}\\bigg{(}\\frac{M_{\\rm c,dco}}{M_{\\rm c,nsns}}\\bigg{)}^{5/6},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mi>dco</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>d</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>dco</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>nsns</mi></mrow></msub></mfrac><mo maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>5</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>6</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02551.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $f_{\\rm close}$ is a probability that system survives SN explosion and form close binary system\n which merge within Hubble Time, $t_{\\rm life}$ is an evolution time for P13, $d_{\\rm c,dco}$ is a \ndistance within which LIGO/VIRGO can detect GW from a given source, $f_{\\rm pos} = 2.26$ is a \ncorrection factor that takes into account the non-uniform pattern of detection and random \nsky location and orientation of sources (Finn, 1996), and $d_{\\rm P13}$ is a distance to\nP13 system.

In case 1 and 3 (progenitor systems undergo CE phase) detection rates are\nmuch higher $0.1\\div0.6$ yr$^{-1}$. The highest value of detection rate was obtained for \nblack hole mass $5\\MS$ and companion star mass $22.5\\MS$. In previous papers authors \nobtained value of emipirical merger rate for BH-NS progenitors at level $R_{\\rm LIGO} = \n2.8 \\times 10^{-2} \\div 0.4$ yr$^{-1}$ for Cyg X-1 system (Belczynski et al. 2011), \n$R_{\\rm LIGO} = 0.09 \\div 0.15$ yr$^{-1}$ for Cyg-X3 system (Belczynski et al. 2013), \nand $R_{\\rm LIGO} = 0.0 \\div 0.187$ yr$^{-1}$ for MWC 656 system (Grudzinska et al. 2015).\nOur results are consistent with the previous estimates.\n\nFor our cases 1 and 3, where we find small, but significant, detection rates\nthe increase of BH spin is negligible due to low mass accretion in CE.\nTherefore, if BH-NS are detected, and if they were formed in P13-channel the\nBH spins are birth spins. \nIn case 2 we expect significant accretion onto BH during stable RLOF, but\nthe detection rates are negligibly small. \nThis is similar to the evolution of BH-BH binaries, for which BH spins are\nexpected to be very close to birth spins as well (Belczynski et al. 2015). \n\nThe nature of compact object in P13 is not established. It was {\\em assumed}\nby Motch et al. (2014) that the compact object is more massive than $5\\MS$ and\ntherefore it must be a BH. However, it cannot be excluded that the mass is\nlower. If the compact object in P13 is a NS and not a BH then evolution follows \nquite a different path. \nIf we replace BH with NS in P13 system, then it will be imposible to get a close \nbinary system with two NSs which will merge within Hubble Time. Close NS-NS\nformation is not expected as the supernova mass loss will be greater than half of \nthe P13 total binary mass before SNa. This would cause the binary disruption\neven without any natal kick. Such evolution {\\em always} results in a null \ndetection rate.\n\nEvolutionary channels that generate high detection rates ($>0.1$ yr$^{-1}$)\ninvolve CE phase. However, it is not at all clear whether CE can be\ninitiated (Pavlovskii and Ivanova 2014/2015) or survived (Belczynski et al. 2007) \nif a donor star is a Hertzsprung gap star: as in {\\em all} our evolutionary\nscenarios that result in high detection rates (cases 1 and 3). If this is taken \ninto account then our major BH-NS formation sequences from P13-like progenitors \nwill not produce any BH-NS mergers. \n\nTo summarize, we have considered consequences of the future evolution of ULX P13. \nWe have shown that it is potentially possible that such binary may form\nBH-NS merger and that associated detection rate with advanced LIGO/Virgo\nis small, but significant. \nHowever, we cannot exclude the possibility, that this type of binary will not \nform a double compact object merger. Therefore, our predicted detection\nrate of BH-NS mergers varies from no detections to $0.6$ yr$^{-1}$. This is the \nfourth empirical estimate of BH-NS merger detection rate.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{references}\n\\refitem{Belczynski, K., et al.}{2007}{ApJ}{662}{504-511}\n\\refitem{Belczynski, K., et al.}{2008}{ApJS}{174}{223-260}\n\\refitem{Belczynski, K., Bulik, T., Bailyn, C.}{2011}{ApJ}{742}{}\n\\refitem{Belczynski, K., et al.}{2013}{ApJ}{764}{}\n\\refitem{Dominik, M., et al.}{2012}{ApJ}{759}{}\n\\refitem{Finn, L.
