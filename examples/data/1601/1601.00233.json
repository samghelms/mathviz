IAMs are designed to\nexplore how best to optimize societal well-being while mitigating climate\nchange. The calculations of human behaviors are made on a regional and\nsectoral basis and can be quite complex, possibly with hundreds of equations\nto account for the interplay between human decisions, technological change,\nand economic growth \\citep{moss2010,IPCC_WG32014}.\n\nPeriodically, model scenarios are updated to account for observed emissions\ntrajectories. For example, it has been noted that the global carbon dioxide\n(CO$_{2}$) emission rate has not only grown along a\n``business-as-usual''~(BAU) trajectory but has in fact slightly exceeded it\n\\citep{Raupach2007,Peters2013}, in spite of a series of international accords\naimed at achieving the opposite \\citep{Nordhaus2010}.\n\nWhat stability in emissions growth might suggest is that the human system has\ninertia, much like physical systems. Current variability reflects an\naccumulation of prior events, so persistent forces from the past tend to have\nthe greatest influence on the present. Such large-scale trends tend to\ncontinue to persist into the future because they are the least responsive to\ncurrent small-scale rapid forces that become diluted in the history of\nactions that preceded them \\citep{Hasselman1976}. It may be that it is\ndifficult to wean ourselves from fossil fuels today because we have spent at\nleast a century accumulating a large global infrastructure for their\nconsumption. It is not that current efforts to move civilization towards\nrenewables cannot change this trajectory of carbon dependency but rather\nthat it will take considerable effort and time.\n\nInertia offers plausibility to a BAU trajectory, particularly\nfor something as highly integrated in the space and time as CO$_{2}$\nemissions by civilization as a whole. Still, assuming persistence in trends\nis something that should only be taken so far. By analogy to meteorological\nforecasts, it is reasonable to assume that clearing skies will lead to\na sunny day. However, prognostic weather models are based on fundamental\nphysical principles that tell us that it cannot keep getting sunnier. Even\na very simple set of equations dictates that at some point a front will pass,\nclouds will form, and a high-pressure system will decay. It is by getting the\nunderlying physics right that we are able to achieve some level of\n\\textit{positive skill} in any forecast attempt (Fig.~\\ref{fig:skill}).\n\nThe macroeconomic components of IAMs do not offer true forecasts that can be\nassigned a skill score. Rather they reflect expert opinions \\citep{moss2010}\nand are mostly unconstrained by external physical forces since they are\npolicy-driven and mathematically constructed so as to allow for an extremely\nbroad range of possible futures \\citep{Pindyck2013}. They consider labor,\nphysical capital, and human inspired technological change to be the motive\nforces for economic production and growth. The focus is on individuals,\nnations, and economic sectors. The model equations describe how physical\ncapital and human prosperity grow with time, and how energy choices tie in\nwith greenhouse gas emissions \\citep{Solow1956,Nordhaus2013DICE}.\n\nPart~1 of this study (\\citealp{GarrettEF2014}, hereafter referred to as Part~1)\ndescribed a second, more deterministic approach. CO$_{2}$ is considered\nto be long-lived and well mixed in the atmosphere, so the magnitude of\ngreenhouse forcing is almost entirely unrelated to the national origin of\nanthropogenic emissions. Then, civilization can be described as a whole, one\nwhere small-scale details at personal, regional, or sectoral levels are not\ntreated explicitly. The only quantity in the model that needs to be resolved\nis an aggregated global economy that is inclusive of all civilization\nelements, including human and physical capital combined.\n\nAs an alternative to IAMs, this new approach offers a means for integrating\nhuman systems and physical systems under a common framework, one where the\ngoverning equations are consistently derived from first thermodynamic\nprinciples. Much like the primitive equations of a prognostic weather model,\nglobal economic growth is expressed as a non-equilibrium response to external\ngradients driving energy dissipation and material flows. There is no explicit\nrole for human decisions; physics does not readily allow for mathematical\nexpressions of policy. Rather, economic innovation and growth is treated\nprimarily as a geophysical phenomenon, in other words the totality of\ncivilization is expressed as an emergent response to available reserves of\nraw materials and energy supplies.\n\nWhatever the approach that is applied, it is important that any societal\nmodel be evaluated for performance. Weather, climate, and financial models\nare regularly evaluated through hindcasts or backtesting. Economic models\nthat simulate the long-run development of humanity need not be an exception.\nA good model, even one that includes policy, should be able to reproduce\ncurrent events with positive skill starting at a point some decades in the\npast. To beat the zero-skill hindcast of persistence, the model would invoke\nfits to concurrent trends to the minimum extent possible.\n\nIn the period following World War II, an economic ``front'' passed that\npropelled civilization towards unprecedented levels of prosperity and, by\nproxy, greenhouse gas emissions. This paper examines whether the theoretical\nmodel introduced in Part~1 can explain the evolution of this front. Section~2\noutlines the philosophical and thermodynamic basis for describing economic\nevolution with physics. Section~3 evaluates this model from hindcasts.\nSections~4 and~5 discuss and summarize the results.\n\n\\section{Forces for economic growth}\n\n\\subsection{The relationship of energy dissipation to human wealth}\n\nA formal framework for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of civilization\ngrowth was laid out in Part~1 \\citep{GarrettEF2014}. The basis for a model\nlinking economics to physics is a fundamental identity that relates a\nmonetary expression for wealth to the rate at which civilization powers\nitself with primary energy sources \\citep{GarrettCO2_2009}. We all have some\nsense of the difference between civilization and its uncivilized surroundings\nsince we have farms, buildings, human population, vehicles, and communication\nnetworks. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:reversible-irreversible} and discussed in\nAppendix~A, this difference implies the existence of a gradient between\ncivilization and its environment. Gradients allow for irreversible\nthermodynamic flows. A consumption and dissipation of potential energy by\ncivilization sustains internal reversible circulations within civilization\nthat characterize all its activities.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{esd-2015-10-f01.png}\n\\caption{Positive skill in forecasts (black line) requires doing better than\npersistence in predicting future evolution of a quantity (red line).\\label{fig:skill}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe hypothesis that was made in Part~1 is that civilization is effectively a\nheat engine whose power can be represented in more human terms as economic\nwealth. Absent any energy consumption, civilization would necessarily decay\ntowards an uncivilized, worthless equilibrium where the gradient ceased to\nexist and all internal circulations stopped. Wealth is able to grow only when\nnet work is done to grow into the environment. Real economic production\noccurs when raw materials can be incorporated into civilization's structure\nfaster than civilization decays (Fig.~\\ref{fig:reversible-irreversible}).\nGrowth at a net positive rate expands civilization's interface with reserves\nof energy. It enlarges civilization, creating new wealth and a greater\noverall capacity of civilization to consume and sustain internal\ncirculations. Expressed as an integral, current economic wealth is the net\naccumulation of past net physical work and real economic production.\n\n\n\nIn effect, there is no intrinsic wealth in and of itself. Rather, as\ndiscussed in Part~1, wealth is built from a network of connections, from the\nproduct of a material length density and an energetic potential. Connections\nare what enable dissipative flows insofar as there exist potential energy\ngradients to drive the flows. For civilization as a whole, wealth is\nsustained by primary power consumption through the connections we have to\nreserves of fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy sources. Within\ncivilization, the interpretation is that wealth is due to the connections\nbetween and among ourselves and our ``physical capital'', and from the\ncirculations along transportation, telecommunications, and social networks.\nAll aspects of civilization, whether social or material, compete for globally\navailable potential energy. Financial expressions of any element's value\nreflect the relative extent to which its connections enable civilization to\nirreversibly consume potential energy in order to sustain the reversible\ncirculations of the global economy.\n\nWhile energy consumption is required to economically produce and grow, a\ngenerally much greater amount is required to sustain circulations within the\nnetworks of connections that have accumulated from prior production in the\npast. An analog is an adult human. People's bodies are also a network of\nconnections that have grown through childhood and adolescence. Far more of\ncurrent daily food consumption goes towards maintaining life than to any\nextra weight gain. Similarly, value added to civilization through\nconstruction of a house decades ago still contributes to value today, by\nbeing part of a larger network that supports the daily rhythms of its inhabitants.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{esd-2015-10-f02.png}\n\\caption{Thermodynamic representation of an open system. Reversible\ncirculations within a system that lies along a constant potential have\na characteristic time $\\tau_\\textrm{circ}$. Circulations are sustained by\na dissipation of a potential energy source that heats the system. The system\nmaintains a steady state (left panel) because energetic (blue) and material (green)\nflows enter and leave the system at the same rate. Where there is a positive\nimbalance (right panel), the system grows irreversibly with timescale\n$\\tau_\\textrm{growth}$\\,$\\gg$\\,$\\tau_\\textrm{circ}$. See Appendix~A for details.\\label{fig:reversible-irreversible}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe analytical formulation of this hypothesis is that instantaneous power\ndissipation, or the rate of primary energy consumption~$a$ by all of\ncivilization (expressible in units of energy per time or power), is linked through a constant~$\\lambda$\n(expressible in units of power per currency) to civilization's inflation-adjusted economic value\n(or civilization wealth) $C$ (expressible in units of currency). Wealth is defined as an\naccumulation of the gross world product~(GWP) $Y$, adjusted for inflation at\nmarket exchange rates~(MER) \\citep{GarrettCO2_2009}.

There do not appear to be other macroeconomic\nforecast models that are equally successful, and in any case, macroeconomic\nmodels are not normally evaluated through comparisons to multi-decadal\nhistorical data. If a comparison with data is made, it is not in the form of\na true hindcast. The model is judged by the extent to which a sufficiently\ncomplex production function can be tuned to provide an accurate fit to prior\nobservations \\citep[e.g.,][]{WarrAyres2006}.\n\nUsing only a fixed value for $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ as input to the model\npresented here appears to work very well, at least for global scales. Still,\na more fully deterministic model would not rely on an assumed value for\n$\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$, even if it is a fit to data prior to the date of model\ninitialization. It is reasonable to anticipate that future rates of resource\ndiscovery and material longevity will evolve with time. Accounting for such\ntechnological change might prove an important consideration for economic and\nclimate forecasters over the coming century.\n\nTo this end, the third test is to try to quantify the thermodynamic\nforces outlined in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:eta_tech}) that would enable a more first-principles estimation of the value of $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$. Methods and\ndata sets for estimating a time series for the sizes of energy reserves, the\nrate of energy consumption, the rate of raw material consumption, and\neconomic inflation during the period between 1950 and 2010 are described in\nAppendix~C and summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:Technologicalchangestatistics}. Average rates are shown for\nthree successive 20-year periods beginning in 1950, and for the 1950\nto 2010 period as a whole.\n\nWhat stands out in Table 2 is how there was unusually rapid technological change between\n1950 and 1970. This period was characterized by rapidly growing access to\nreserves of oil, gas, and raw materials. It was followed by an abrupt\nslowdown in 1970 with no clear long-term recovery since. Summing over these\nforces, and averaged over the entire 1950 to 2010 period, rates of\ntechnological change $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ are estimated to have been\na respectable 3.5\\,\\% per year. Most of this growth took place in the\nfirst 20~years, when it achieved 7.0\\,\\% per year. The latest\n20-year period averaged just 1.4\\,\\% per year.\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\\centering\n\\caption{Components of technological change expressed as 20- and 60-year\naverages of growth rates.

(As a consequence of $\\lambda$ being\na constant, calculated rates of return~$\\eta$ are similar whether they are\ncalculated from available energy statistics using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:eta}) or from\nGWP statistics using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:etaYintY}).

Whether the residual 1.6\\,\\% per year\nis due to data uncertainties or theoretical considerations is unknown.\n\nThe hindcasts in Sect.~3.2 assumed a constant value for $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$,\nwhereas the observed rates summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:Economicgrowthrates}\npoint towards much higher variability. Perhaps the reason a constant value\nnonetheless leads to hindcasts with high skill scores is because there is\na timescale of decades for externally forced technological change to diffuse\nthroughout the global economy \\citep[e.g.,][]{rogers2010diffusion}. Assuming\na fixed value for $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ represents this timescale by smoothing\nthe economy-wide impacts of a large impulse of innovative forces that\noccurred between 1950 and 1970.\n\n\\section{Positive skill in economic forecasts}\n\nA logistic equation forms the basis of the prognostic model \nthat provides hindcasts for civilization growth as a whole. At the level of empires, there have been similar\nwaves of logistic or sigmoidal growth throughout history. An initial phase of\nexponential growth tends to be followed by slower rates of expansion. Ancient\nRome's empire increased to cover 3\\,500\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ in its first\n300~years, but only a further 1\\,000\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ in its\nsecond; the Mongol empire extended to 20\\,000\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ within\n50~years, adding an additional 4\\,000\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ in the next\n\\citep{Marchetti2012}. Growth at declining rates has also been noted in the\nadoption of new technologies \\citep{rogers2010diffusion}, the size of oil\ntankers \\citep{Smil2006}, bacteria \\citep{zwietering1990modeling}, and\nsnowflakes \\citep{PruppacherKlett1997}.\n\nIn a very general way, these common emergent behaviors might be viewed as the\nresponse of a system to available reserves of potential energy and matter.\nConsumption of resources allows for expansion into more resources and hence\nmore consumption. Eventually, new consumption becomes increasingly diluted by\npast consumption in which case growth slows. The mathematical expression of\nthe dynamics is fairly simple \\citep{GarrettEF2014}, and it has been shown\nhere how it can serve as a foundation for making 50-year hindcasts of\nthe global economy (Fig.~\\ref{fig:IVP}).\n\nThe accuracy of the hindcasts shown here appears to be due in part to a remarkable\nburst of technological change that occurred between 1950 and 1970.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:gasandoil} encapsulates its magnitude. From available\nstatistics, oil and gas reserves expanded faster than they were consumed.\nThis changed around 1970. Reserves continued to be uncovered, but they only\nbarely kept pace with increasing demand. Early innovation and growth began to\nact as a drag on future innovation.\n\nHow rapid resource discovery played out is captured mathematically by\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:innovation_expression}), at least assuming a fixed value for\n$\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ of about 5.1\\,\\% per year. Forecasting future scenarios may not be so easy because\nthe evolutionary behavior is most clear when $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ is large.\nCivilization growth rates~$\\eta$ have nearly completed their adjustment to\nthe asymptotic value of $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}/2$ that is predicted by\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:logistic_solution-1}). What this implies is that, because\ninnovation appears to have dropped to relatively low levels in recent\ndecades, there is no longer a clear past signal that can be relied upon to\npropel civilization forward in a prognostic model; the post-war impulse has\nlargely run its course.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{esd-2015-10-f08.png}\n\\caption{Discovered, consumed, and remaining global reserves of gas and oil\nsince 1950 \\citep[source:][]{IHS}.\\label{fig:gasandoil}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThis does not mean that the model described here lacks utility looking\nforward; rather, it implies that $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ must be derived from\nsomething more than a fit to the past. To this end, three forces for\ntechnological change were identified (Eq.~\\ref{eq:eta_tech}). One is how fast\ncivilization networks fray from such externalities as natural disasters. The\nothers address the accessibility of raw materials and how fast new energy\nreserves are discovered relative to their rates of depletion. Predictions of\nhow these three factors combine may provide a basis for future scenarios for\nhumanity, based more on external physical forces than internal human policies.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nIn Lewis Carroll's \\textit{Through the Looking Glass}, Alice was urged by the\nRed Queen to run with her ever faster. But, ``however fast they went, they\nnever seemed to pass anything''. As the Red Queen put it, ``Now,\n\\textit{here}, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the\nsame place''. In the 1950s and 1960s, civilization made exceptionally rapid\ngains in energy reserve discovery and resource extraction efficiency. This\nspurred a rapid acceleration of growth in global wealth that required an\nequal demand for energy. What followed post-1970 was more constrained growth\nbecause diminishing returns settles in for any large system and because\nfossil fuel resource discovery only just kept up with increasing demand \\citep{Bardi2009,Murray2012}.\n\n\n\nFurther along, we might anticipate that decay from natural disasters and\nenvironmental degradation will also play an important role in civilization's growth trajectory\n\\citep{arrow1995economic}. Statistics presented here suggest that decay has\nthus far been a comparatively weak player. This may change if, as expected, atmospheric CO$_{2}$\nconcentrations reach ``dangerous'' levels and decay rates increase\n\\citep{HansenDangerous2007,Matthews2009,Garrettcoupled2011,Mora2013}.\n\nShould diminishing returns, resource depletion, and decay combine to cause\ncivilization growth to stall, then simulations described in Part~1 suggest\nthat external forces may have the potential to push civilization into a phase\nof accelerating decline. Civilization lacks the extra energy required to\ncompensate for continued natural disasters, much less grow, and so it tips\ntowards collapse.\n\nContraction of wealth implies a rate of return~$\\eta$ that is negative\n(Eq.~\\ref{eq:eta}). From Eq.~(\\ref{eq:eta_P/C}), this suggests a global economy with\na positive nominal GWP but, in effect, a negative real GWP. Fortunately,\nrecent history does not provide a guide for such a global economic disaster.\nStill, one might imagine a scenario where historically accumulated global\nwealth shrinks because, at regional or sectoral levels, an ever smaller\nfraction of civilization remains involved in gross economic production. A\nnominal GWP remains to be tallied, but it is increasingly offset elsewhere by\nsome combination of wars, a degrading environment, growing unemployment,\ninflation, death, and decay. Energy consumption is still required to support\nsociety -- after all, we must always eat. But a diminishing portion\nof society is able to add net value calculated with monetary instruments that\noffer promises of future returns.\n\nThe silver lining of a contracting civilization might be slowing\nCO$_{2}$ emissions, and eventually slower climate change. The model\nintroduced in Part~1 for making multi-decadal hindcasts of civilization\nevolution allows for both positive and negative feedbacks to be represented\nin the coupled evolution of the human--climate system. This paper shows that\nthe economic side of this model is successful at reproducing the past\n50~years of economic growth. The next step will be to use the model to\nprovide a range of physically constrained forecasts for the evolution of\ncivilization and the atmosphere for the remainder of this century.\n\n\n\n\\appendix\n\\section{Reversible cycles and irreversible flows}\n\nAn implicit consideration with the approach taken here is that it separates\nsmall, short-term, ``micro-'' economic behaviors from larger, longer-term,\n``macro-'' economic evolution. From the perspective of thermodynamics,\nshort-term equilibrium, reversible, cyclic behaviors that are not explicitly\nresolved are separated from longer-term non-equilibrium, irreversible dynamics\nthat are resolved. This is a common strategy, one illustrated in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:reversible-irreversible}, as familiar as the separation of the\ntachometer and speedometer in a car. One represents reversible engine cycles,\nwhereas the other expresses the rate of irreversible travel down the road.\n\nIn general, reversible and irreversible processes are linked. This is because\nthe second law of thermodynamics prescribes that all processes are irreversible. Introducing\nthe concept of reversible circulations within a system is a useful\nidealization. However, such circulations can only be sustained by an\nexternal, irreversible flow of energy and matter through the system. When\nopen systems are near a balance or a steady state, then reversible\ncirculations can be represented as a four-step Carnot cycle or heat engine\nwhereby external heating raises the system potential so that raw materials\ndiffuse from outside the system to inside the system \\citep{Zemanksy1997}.\nWaste heat is dissipated to the environment so that the system can relax to\nits ground potential state where it releases exhaust or undergoes decay.\nAveraged over time, the circulations within the system maintain a fixed\namplitude and period $\\tau_\\textrm{circ}$.\n\nFor example, the dynamic circulations of a hurricane are sustained by\na inflow of oceanic heat and an outflow of thermal radiation to space\n\\citep{Emanuel1987}. In the case of civilization, we consume energy in order\nto sustain circulations and extract raw materials from the environment,\nleaving behind material waste and radiated heat. Petroleum in a car propels\nour material selves to and from work, where we consume carbohydrates,\nproteins,\nand fats to propel electrical signals to and from our brains so that we can\nconsume electricity from coal in order to propel charge along copper wires to\nand from our computers. Through radiation, frictional losses, and other\ninefficiencies, all potential energy is ultimately dissipated as waste heat\nto the atmosphere and ultimately through radiation to space at the mean\nplanetary blackbody temperature of 255\\,K. Over short timescales,\nconsumption approximately equals dissipation, and civilization circulations\nmaintain a steady state.\n\nOver longer timescales, any small imbalance between consumption and\ndissipation by civilization becomes magnified. Raw materials are slowly\nincorporated into civilization's fabric at rate $1/\\tau_\\textrm{growth}$\n(Fig.~\\ref{fig:reversible-irreversible}). Further, at the same time that\ncivilization grows, resources are discovered and depleted, and perhaps as\na consequence of climate change, decay rates increase too. The focus shifts\nfrom the short-term reversible circulations associated with our daily lives\nto the longer-term timescales associated with the non-equilibrium,\nirreversible growth of civilization as a whole.\n\n\\section{Comparisons with traditional economic frameworks}\n\nThe definition for innovation d$\\ln\\eta/$d$t$ that has been\nintroduced here is very similar to definitions that have been made elsewhere.\nTraditional neoclassical growth models calculate the nominal growth of\n``physical capital''~$K$ (in units of currency) from the difference between the\nportion~$s$ of production $P$ that is a savings or investment and capital\ndepreciation at rate~$\\delta$\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 40718, "prevtext": "\nWithin the stated uncertainty, the observed slope relating innovation to\nrates of return is consistent with the theoretically expected value of~$-$2\nthat comes from a law of diminishing returns. The implied rate of\ntechnological discovery for this time period $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ is the\nintercept of the fit, or about 6\\,\\% per year. The magnitude of the\ndifference of the fit from the anticipated slope might be an indication that\n$\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ has not in fact been a strict constant but rather has declined with slowly with time, as discussed below.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Hindcasts of long-run civilization growth}\n\nThe second test is to approach the problem as a hindcast.

There do not appear to be other macroeconomic\nforecast models that are equally successful, and in any case, macroeconomic\nmodels are not normally evaluated through comparisons to multi-decadal\nhistorical data. If a comparison with data is made, it is not in the form of\na true hindcast. The model is judged by the extent to which a sufficiently\ncomplex production function can be tuned to provide an accurate fit to prior\nobservations \\citep[e.g.,][]{WarrAyres2006}.\n\nUsing only a fixed value for $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ as input to the model\npresented here appears to work very well, at least for global scales. Still,\na more fully deterministic model would not rely on an assumed value for\n$\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$, even if it is a fit to data prior to the date of model\ninitialization. It is reasonable to anticipate that future rates of resource\ndiscovery and material longevity will evolve with time. Accounting for such\ntechnological change might prove an important consideration for economic and\nclimate forecasters over the coming century.\n\nTo this end, the third test is to try to quantify the thermodynamic\nforces outlined in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:eta_tech}) that would enable a more first-principles estimation of the value of $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$. Methods and\ndata sets for estimating a time series for the sizes of energy reserves, the\nrate of energy consumption, the rate of raw material consumption, and\neconomic inflation during the period between 1950 and 2010 are described in\nAppendix~C and summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:Technologicalchangestatistics}. Average rates are shown for\nthree successive 20-year periods beginning in 1950, and for the 1950\nto 2010 period as a whole.\n\nWhat stands out in Table 2 is how there was unusually rapid technological change between\n1950 and 1970. This period was characterized by rapidly growing access to\nreserves of oil, gas, and raw materials. It was followed by an abrupt\nslowdown in 1970 with no clear long-term recovery since. Summing over these\nforces, and averaged over the entire 1950 to 2010 period, rates of\ntechnological change $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ are estimated to have been\na respectable 3.5\\,\\% per year. Most of this growth took place in the\nfirst 20~years, when it achieved 7.0\\,\\% per year. The latest\n20-year period averaged just 1.4\\,\\% per year.\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\\centering\n\\caption{Components of technological change expressed as 20- and 60-year\naverages of growth rates.

Since 1970, energy\nconsumption and raw material consumption have grown at nearly equivalent rates,\nimplying no associated force for technological change.\n\nAs a check on the first-principles estimate that the average value of\n$\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ between 1950 and 2010 was 3.5\\,\\% per year,\nTable~\\ref{tab:Economicgrowthrates} shows the 20- and 60-year averages\nof $\\eta$ and d$\\ln\\eta/$d$t$, and it uses these to derive a\nrate of technological change $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ from\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:innovation_expression}). (As a consequence of $\\lambda$ being\na constant, calculated rates of return~$\\eta$ are similar whether they are\ncalculated from available energy statistics using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:eta}) or from\nGWP statistics using Eq.~(\\ref{eq:etaYintY}).

Thus, the estimated average rate of technological change derived from\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:innovation_expression}) (i.e., $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$\\,$=$\\,d$\\ln\\eta/$d$t$\\,$+$\\,2$\\eta$) is 5.1\\,\\%\nper year, similar to what was derived for the 1950 to 1960 time period as\ndiscussed in Sect.~3.2. In comparison, the rate of technological change\nestimated from the physical parameters described in\nTable~\\ref{tab:Technologicalchangestatistics} averages 3.5\\,\\% per\nyear, or about one-third lower. Whether the residual 1.6\\,\\% per year\nis due to data uncertainties or theoretical considerations is unknown.\n\nThe hindcasts in Sect.~3.2 assumed a constant value for $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$,\nwhereas the observed rates summarized in Table~\\ref{tab:Economicgrowthrates}\npoint towards much higher variability. Perhaps the reason a constant value\nnonetheless leads to hindcasts with high skill scores is because there is\na timescale of decades for externally forced technological change to diffuse\nthroughout the global economy \\citep[e.g.,][]{rogers2010diffusion}. Assuming\na fixed value for $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ represents this timescale by smoothing\nthe economy-wide impacts of a large impulse of innovative forces that\noccurred between 1950 and 1970.\n\n\\section{Positive skill in economic forecasts}\n\nA logistic equation forms the basis of the prognostic model \nthat provides hindcasts for civilization growth as a whole. At the level of empires, there have been similar\nwaves of logistic or sigmoidal growth throughout history. An initial phase of\nexponential growth tends to be followed by slower rates of expansion. Ancient\nRome's empire increased to cover 3\\,500\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ in its first\n300~years, but only a further 1\\,000\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ in its\nsecond; the Mongol empire extended to 20\\,000\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ within\n50~years, adding an additional 4\\,000\\,000\\,km$^{2}$ in the next\n\\citep{Marchetti2012}. Growth at declining rates has also been noted in the\nadoption of new technologies \\citep{rogers2010diffusion}, the size of oil\ntankers \\citep{Smil2006}, bacteria \\citep{zwietering1990modeling}, and\nsnowflakes \\citep{PruppacherKlett1997}.\n\nIn a very general way, these common emergent behaviors might be viewed as the\nresponse of a system to available reserves of potential energy and matter.\nConsumption of resources allows for expansion into more resources and hence\nmore consumption. Eventually, new consumption becomes increasingly diluted by\npast consumption in which case growth slows. The mathematical expression of\nthe dynamics is fairly simple \\citep{GarrettEF2014}, and it has been shown\nhere how it can serve as a foundation for making 50-year hindcasts of\nthe global economy (Fig.~\\ref{fig:IVP}).\n\nThe accuracy of the hindcasts shown here appears to be due in part to a remarkable\nburst of technological change that occurred between 1950 and 1970.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:gasandoil} encapsulates its magnitude. From available\nstatistics, oil and gas reserves expanded faster than they were consumed.\nThis changed around 1970. Reserves continued to be uncovered, but they only\nbarely kept pace with increasing demand. Early innovation and growth began to\nact as a drag on future innovation.\n\nHow rapid resource discovery played out is captured mathematically by\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:innovation_expression}), at least assuming a fixed value for\n$\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ of about 5.1\\,\\% per year. Forecasting future scenarios may not be so easy because\nthe evolutionary behavior is most clear when $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ is large.\nCivilization growth rates~$\\eta$ have nearly completed their adjustment to\nthe asymptotic value of $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}/2$ that is predicted by\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:logistic_solution-1}). What this implies is that, because\ninnovation appears to have dropped to relatively low levels in recent\ndecades, there is no longer a clear past signal that can be relied upon to\npropel civilization forward in a prognostic model; the post-war impulse has\nlargely run its course.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{esd-2015-10-f08.png}\n\\caption{Discovered, consumed, and remaining global reserves of gas and oil\nsince 1950 \\citep[source:][]{IHS}.\\label{fig:gasandoil}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThis does not mean that the model described here lacks utility looking\nforward; rather, it implies that $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ must be derived from\nsomething more than a fit to the past. To this end, three forces for\ntechnological change were identified (Eq.~\\ref{eq:eta_tech}). One is how fast\ncivilization networks fray from such externalities as natural disasters. The\nothers address the accessibility of raw materials and how fast new energy\nreserves are discovered relative to their rates of depletion. Predictions of\nhow these three factors combine may provide a basis for future scenarios for\nhumanity, based more on external physical forces than internal human policies.\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nIn Lewis Carroll's \\textit{Through the Looking Glass}, Alice was urged by the\nRed Queen to run with her ever faster. But, ``however fast they went, they\nnever seemed to pass anything''. As the Red Queen put it, ``Now,\n\\textit{here}, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the\nsame place''. In the 1950s and 1960s, civilization made exceptionally rapid\ngains in energy reserve discovery and resource extraction efficiency. This\nspurred a rapid acceleration of growth in global wealth that required an\nequal demand for energy. What followed post-1970 was more constrained growth\nbecause diminishing returns settles in for any large system and because\nfossil fuel resource discovery only just kept up with increasing demand \\citep{Bardi2009,Murray2012}.\n\n\n\nFurther along, we might anticipate that decay from natural disasters and\nenvironmental degradation will also play an important role in civilization's growth trajectory\n\\citep{arrow1995economic}. Statistics presented here suggest that decay has\nthus far been a comparatively weak player. This may change if, as expected, atmospheric CO$_{2}$\nconcentrations reach ``dangerous'' levels and decay rates increase\n\\citep{HansenDangerous2007,Matthews2009,Garrettcoupled2011,Mora2013}.\n\nShould diminishing returns, resource depletion, and decay combine to cause\ncivilization growth to stall, then simulations described in Part~1 suggest\nthat external forces may have the potential to push civilization into a phase\nof accelerating decline. Civilization lacks the extra energy required to\ncompensate for continued natural disasters, much less grow, and so it tips\ntowards collapse.\n\nContraction of wealth implies a rate of return~$\\eta$ that is negative\n(Eq.~\\ref{eq:eta}). From Eq.~(\\ref{eq:eta_P/C}), this suggests a global economy with\na positive nominal GWP but, in effect, a negative real GWP. Fortunately,\nrecent history does not provide a guide for such a global economic disaster.\nStill, one might imagine a scenario where historically accumulated global\nwealth shrinks because, at regional or sectoral levels, an ever smaller\nfraction of civilization remains involved in gross economic production. A\nnominal GWP remains to be tallied, but it is increasingly offset elsewhere by\nsome combination of wars, a degrading environment, growing unemployment,\ninflation, death, and decay. Energy consumption is still required to support\nsociety -- after all, we must always eat. But a diminishing portion\nof society is able to add net value calculated with monetary instruments that\noffer promises of future returns.\n\nThe silver lining of a contracting civilization might be slowing\nCO$_{2}$ emissions, and eventually slower climate change. The model\nintroduced in Part~1 for making multi-decadal hindcasts of civilization\nevolution allows for both positive and negative feedbacks to be represented\nin the coupled evolution of the human--climate system. This paper shows that\nthe economic side of this model is successful at reproducing the past\n50~years of economic growth. The next step will be to use the model to\nprovide a range of physically constrained forecasts for the evolution of\ncivilization and the atmosphere for the remainder of this century.\n\n\n\n\\appendix\n\\section{Reversible cycles and irreversible flows}\n\nAn implicit consideration with the approach taken here is that it separates\nsmall, short-term, ``micro-'' economic behaviors from larger, longer-term,\n``macro-'' economic evolution. From the perspective of thermodynamics,\nshort-term equilibrium, reversible, cyclic behaviors that are not explicitly\nresolved are separated from longer-term non-equilibrium, irreversible dynamics\nthat are resolved.

However, such circulations can only be sustained by an\nexternal, irreversible flow of energy and matter through the system. When\nopen systems are near a balance or a steady state, then reversible\ncirculations can be represented as a four-step Carnot cycle or heat engine\nwhereby external heating raises the system potential so that raw materials\ndiffuse from outside the system to inside the system \\citep{Zemanksy1997}.\nWaste heat is dissipated to the environment so that the system can relax to\nits ground potential state where it releases exhaust or undergoes decay.\nAveraged over time, the circulations within the system maintain a fixed\namplitude and period $\\tau_\\textrm{circ}$.\n\nFor example, the dynamic circulations of a hurricane are sustained by\na inflow of oceanic heat and an outflow of thermal radiation to space\n\\citep{Emanuel1987}. In the case of civilization, we consume energy in order\nto sustain circulations and extract raw materials from the environment,\nleaving behind material waste and radiated heat. Petroleum in a car propels\nour material selves to and from work, where we consume carbohydrates,\nproteins,\nand fats to propel electrical signals to and from our brains so that we can\nconsume electricity from coal in order to propel charge along copper wires to\nand from our computers. Through radiation, frictional losses, and other\ninefficiencies, all potential energy is ultimately dissipated as waste heat\nto the atmosphere and ultimately through radiation to space at the mean\nplanetary blackbody temperature of 255\\,K. Over short timescales,\nconsumption approximately equals dissipation, and civilization circulations\nmaintain a steady state.\n\nOver longer timescales, any small imbalance between consumption and\ndissipation by civilization becomes magnified.

What\nis normally assumed is the reverse \\citep{PacalaSocolow2004,Raupach2007}.\nWhile the concept of ``backfire'' has been reached within more traditional\neconomic contexts \\citep{Saunders2000,Alcott2005}, it is a conclusion that\nremains highly disputed, at least where economies are viewed at purely\nsectoral levels \\citep{Sorrell_UKERC2007,Sorrell2014}.\n\nHere, increased production efficiency $f$\\,$=$\\,$Y/a$ leads to an acceleration of\nenergy consumption at rate $\\eta$\\,$=$\\,$\\lambda{f}$ because it expands civilization's\nboundaries with new and existing energy reservoirs \\citep{GarrettEF2014}.\nEnergy reservoirs may eventually be depleted, but at any given point in time efficiency\npermits the positive feedback that leads to ever faster rates of consumption.\n\n\n\nA simple example is to contrast a sick child with a healthy child. Without\nhaving to know the ``sectoral'' level details of cellular function, it is\nclear that a healthy child will grow fastest. Health here is an implicit\nrepresentation of the child's ability to efficiently convert current food\nconsumption to growth and increased future consumption. Food contains the\nenergy and matter that the child requires to grow to adulthood. At this\npoint, hopefully, a law of diminishing returns takes over so that weight is\nable to maintain a steady state.\n\n\\section{Estimated rates of technological change}\n\nEstimates of technological change rates $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$ require global-scale statistics for the size of energy reserves, the rate of energy\nconsumption, the rate of raw material consumption, and economic inflation.\nA challenge is that the reliability and availability of statistics diminishes\nthe further back one goes in time. Accurate record keeping can be a challenge\neven for the most developed nations, much less for every nation. While global\nstatistics for inflation might be available since 1970, they are given for\nonly for a few countries in the 1950s \\citep[United][]{UNstats}.\n\nIt is also not obvious how to sensibly represent raw material consumption.\nCement, steel, copper, and wood may be among the more obviously important\ncomponents of the material flow to civilization, but their proportionate\nweights are far from clear. Steel is consumed in much greater volume than\ncopper since it is a basic building material. But copper is an efficient\nconduit for electricity and equally important for civilization development.\n\nWith respect to energy reserves, the focus here is on fossil fuels since they\nremain the primary component of the global energy supply. Energy resources\nrepresent a total that may ultimately prove recoverable. Energy reserves\nrepresent the fraction of resources that is considered currently accessible\ngiven existing political and technological considerations. Unfortunately,\nthere is no precise definition of what this means. Moreover, reserve and\nresource estimates are provided by countries and companies that may have\npolitical reasons to misrepresent the numbers \\citep{Hook2010,Sorrell2010}.\n\nThe thermodynamic term $\\Delta{H}_\\textrm{R}$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:discovery})\nrepresents the potential energy that is available to drive civilization\nflows. It would seem to be most obviously represented by reserves rather than\nresources since reserves are what are most accessible and they most directly\nexert an external pressure on civilization. A question that arises is how to\nprovide some self-consistent way to add reserves of solid coal to reserves of\nnatural gas and oil that diffuse to civilization as a fluid.\nThermodynamically, any form of fossil fuel extraction requires some energy\nbarrier to be crossed, or an amount of work that must be done, in order to\nmake the potential energy immediately available so that it can diffuse to the\neconomy. The rate of diffusion is proportional to a pressure gradient (in units\nenergy density).\n\nFor example, well pressure forces a fluid fuel to the surface. Once the\nenergy barrier of building the well is crossed, the magnitude of the pressure\ncan be related to the well reserve size $\\Delta{H}_\\textrm{R}$\n\\citep{Hook2014}. In contrast, coal reserves must be actively mined with\na continuous energy expenditure. Even if the coal reserve is discovered,\nthere remains a clear energetic cost in order to obtain an energetic return\n\\citep{Murphy2010,kiefer2013energy}. A hint at the importance of this energy\nbarrier is that new fluid fuel reserves like oil and gas appear to affect\neconomies much more rapidly than coal \\citep{Bernanke1997,Stijns2005,Hook2010,Hook2014}, perhaps because they are\nmore easily extracted and consumed.\n\nIn what is hopefully a defensible first step, the aforementioned concerns are\naddressed as follows for the purpose of calculating rates of technological\nchange $\\eta_\\textrm{tech}$. Rates of growth of energy reserves\n(Eq.~\\ref{eq:discovery}) are determined assuming that coal consumption is not\nreserve-constrained, and rather that the closest solid equivalent to reserves\nof oil and gas in terms of accessibility is coal-fired power plants. Like\ndiscovering and exploiting an oil well, a power plant must be constructed,\nand it is only at this point that the coal reserve can be accessed to power\ncivilization. Total reserves are then the production weighted sum of the\nrates of growth of coal production capacity, oil reserves, and gas reserves \\citep{Rutledge2011,IHS}.\n\n\n\nChanges in civilization longevity are estimated using\nEq.~(\\ref{eq:eta-delta-inflation}), which expresses decay in terms of\ninflation. Global inflation statistics since 1970 are readily available\n\\citep[United][]{UNstats}. For the period before 1970, an estimate is an\naverage is taken of the respective inflation rates from the USA, Great\nBritain, Japan, Germany, Italy, and France \\citep{Inflationstats}.\n\nRates of change in the specific energy of raw material extraction\n$e_\\textrm{s}^\\textrm{tot}$\\,$=$\\,$a/j_\\textrm{a}$ (Eq.~\\ref{eq:etae}) are\nderived from statistics for global rates of energy consumption from all\nsources~$a$ \\citep{AER2011}, and from statistics for the consumption of iron\nand steel, copper, wood (excluding fuelwood), and cement\n\\citep{FAOwoodstats2012,CDIAC_CO2emissions2013,Copperstats2014,Ironandsteelstats2014}.\nWood and cement are treated as substitutable construction materials and are\nadded according to their respective volumes. The total rate of change in\n$j_\\textrm{a}$ is then a simple average of the three rates of change: wood\nand cement, copper, and iron and steel.\n\nStatistics for the components of technological change are provided in\nTable~\\ref{tab:Technologicalchangestatistics}.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThis work was supported by the Kauffman Foundation, whose views it does not\nclaim to represent.
