Building large telescopes is mechanically and economically challenging. Several schools, colleges and community astronomy clubs have optical telescopes, however, radio telescopes are not as famous due to their cost, the size and complexity of the data. We have developed a small, affordable radio telescope and data analysis tools to do amateur radio astronomy at such levels.\\\\\n\nFor demonstrating the usefulness of such a set-up, we have measured the brightness temperature of the sun. We present how this can be used to measure the flux density of the sun and correlate them with presently available data. Modifications in the observation techniques, which improved the sensitivity and enabled us to detect point sources such as Saturn and extended sources such as the galactic arm, is also discussed here.\n\n\\section{Aims and Set-up}\nThe prime motivation behind this project was to assemble and operationalize a low-cost radio telescope for amateur radio astronomy, study the properties of the telescope components and finally establish an undergraduate level experiment in radio astronomy. One that teaches the rudiments of this very well established technology by providing the necessary experiments.\\\\\n\nThe setup has been proposed and assembled previously from NCRA(ASRT)\\cite{ASRT}, MIT(VSRT)\\cite{VSRT}, NRAO(IBT)\\cite{NRAO}, which was initially motivated by the works of Cleary et. al(1993) \\cite{Cleary}. This provided the groundwork to build on. A block diagram of our assembled setup is shown in \\autoref{setupcircuit}. The key components of the set up are:\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./setup_circuit.png}\n\\caption{Block diagram of the setup.}\n\\label{setupcircuit}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Satellite Antenna: Satellite dish antenna consisting of a 68 cm parabolic dish reflector and an LNB (Low Noise Block). The LNB receives the radio signal from the satellite reflected by the dish and amplifies it. A set-top box powers the satellite finder and the LNB.\n\\item Satellite Finder: A satellite signal meter is commonly used for orienting satellite dishes towards geostationary satellites. We have used a commercially available analog satellite finder (\\textbf{GC SF-02}). Such a device acts as a square law detector and is used to read directly the intensity.\n\\item Arduino Uno: Arduino is a microcontroller board with a 10 bit Analog to Digital Converter for us. Using this board, we digitize the intensity from the satellite finder at 10Hz sampling rate. \n\\end{enumerate}\nThe python pipeline for data acquisition and visualization can be found online.\\cite{pipeline}\n\n\\section{Analysis}\n\\label{analysis}\nGeostationary satellites emit polarized radiation, after pointing in the direction of satellites, the LNB was rotated to align the monopole inside in the direction of polarized radiation maximizing the detected signal intensity. Pointing was done manually in all the cases, by firstly looking at the source Altitude and Azimuth in the local sky at that time, using Stellarium and then rotating the dish about the two axes individually to point at the source location. The telescope was calibrated with geostationary satellites and power per unit voltage was calculated. For the temperature calculation, power density was calculated given aperture efficiency followed by the flux calculation. By assuming the sun's radiation to be thermal, the temperature was calculated following Rayleigh-Jeans law.\\cite{stix} See \\autoref{appendix1} for detailed calculations.\\\\\n\nFor beam-width calculation, the voltage data (in dBV) was fitted with a Gaussian ($f\\left(t\\right) = a e^{- { \\frac{(t-b)^2 }{ 2 c^2} } }$) using python and Full Width at Half Maxima (FWHM) was calculated using the variance ($\\mathrm{FWHM} = 2 \\sqrt{2 \\ln 2}\\ c$). \\autoref{table3} provides the obtained values. \\autoref{driftscan}, shows the drift scan of the sun. A Gaussian was fit to the data and beam width of our telescope was characterized to be $ \\sim 3.5^{\\circ} $ with less than 1\\% error. These are in agreement with standard online beam width calculators\\cite{beamwidth} which estimate beam width of our system to be $ \\sim 3.4^{\\circ}$.\n\\begin{table}[!h]\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\nEpoch(MJD) &Beam width(degree) \\\\\n\\hline\n57111&3.357 $\\pm$ 0.021\\\\\n\\hline\n57108&3.501 $\\pm$ 0.007\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Beam width calculated from graphs}\n\\label{table3}\n\\end{table}\nFor the noise analysis, the dish was pointed at the cold sky. By cold sky, we refer to the continuous radiation coming from the sky in absence of a source in the field of view of the telescope. This signal is predominantly due to the presence of Cosmic Microwave Background. A Fourier fit was performed, and residuals were termed as noise and taken forward for FFT in MATLAB. To evaluate the system generated noise, the LNB was shielded with thick aluminium foils to block any external radiation from reaching the system, and the same procedure was repeated.\\\\\n\nThe noise in the signal (from the cold sky) is dominated by the system generated noise. The features in the FFT spectra (like a bump near $\\sim$ 0.5 Hz) of system generated noise gets carried forward in the FFT spectra of the cold sky. The FFT spectra also revealed a difference in the power levels of the signal and the system generated noise. The signal had a higher  noise power, which was likely to be observed.\nA difference in power levels of FFT spectrum for various days during day and night time was also noticed. This difference could be ascribed to temperature variations during the period of observation. \\autoref{fig:my_label1} and \\autoref{fig:my_label2} show the FFT spectrum during night and day time respectively.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{./fft_dec.pdf}\n\\caption{FFT of the daytime data.

The flux received from these satellites and their corresponding voltages used in the calculation are shown in \\autoref{table1} and \\autoref{table2}. The brightness temperature of the sun was calculated to near 10,000 K with a maximum error of 3.23 \\%, which is slightly lower than the values reported by Zirin et. al (1991)\\cite{Zirin}.
