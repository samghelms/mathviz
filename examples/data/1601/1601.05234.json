A single semiconductor quantum dot represents the two level\nsystem and is resonantly excited either with coherent laser light, or excited\nwith chaotic light, with photon statistics corresponding to that of thermal\nradiation. Experimentally, we observe a reduced absorption cross-section under\nchaotic excitation in the steady-state. In the transient regime, the Rabi\noscillations observable under coherent excitation disappear under chaotic\nexcitation. Likewise, in the emission spectrum the well-known Mollow triplet,\nwhich we observe under coherent drive, \ndisappears under chaotic excitation. Our observations are fully consistent\nwith theoretical predictions based on the semi-classical Bloch equation\napproach. They represent a landmark in the resonant excitation of the quantum\nmechanical two level system.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle  \n\nThe fermionic two level system (TLS) is the prototype of a quantum system. \nAs a realization of the quantum bit it finds a plethora of applications in\nquantum information\nprocessing\\,\\cite{Devoret2013a,0953-8984-18-21-S08,Nielsen2010}.\nHence it is not surprising that two level systems under coherent excitation, e.g. under excitation \nwith laser light or microwaves, are vastly studied and constitute a principal\ntopic in any textbook on quantum physics.\nToday, the interaction of individual TLSs with coherent radiation or even single photons is routinely studied \nin many experiments with single atoms and ions in the gas phase, defect centers in wide band-gap materials\nor semiconductor quantum dots\\,\\cite{Leibfried2003,Meyer2015,Wolters2013a}.\nThese experiments form the basis of many exciting applications in quantum technology.\nInterestingly, until now the influence of the excitation statistics on TLSs\nhas not been experimentally explored, neither in atomic nor in solid state\nsystems.\nThe underlying physics of this open question is of great interest from a fundamental point of\nview and is also motivated by the fact that coherent excitation conditions are rather artificial as virtually all\n radiation occurring in nature, e.g.  black-body radiation or bremsstrahlung, is\nof chaotic nature.\\\\\nIn this letter we set out to experimentally investigate\nthe resonant excitation of single semiconductor quantum dots in\nthe so far unexplored regime of resonant driving with chaotic light. \nIn our comprehensive studies we compare fluorescence intensity, emission spectra \nand dynamics of a two level system represented by a semiconductor quantum\ndot (QD) under excitation with coherent and chaotic light.\nIn the steady-state, we find a reduced absorption cross-section under chaotic\nexcitation.\n\n\nIn addition, in the emission spectrum the well-known Mollow triplet present\nunder coherent drive of the TLS disappears under chaotic excitation, and likewise no signatures of Rabi oscillations\n are observed in the time domain.\nAt the same time, the non-classical character of the photon emission of the TLS\nis preserved under chaotic excitation, as shown in second order auto-correlation measurements.\nAll of these experimental findings are in excellent agreement with a\nquantum mechanical description of the experimental condition.\n\nCoherent light exhibits a Poissonian photon number distribution, where the\nprobability $p_{\\textrm{pd}}(n)$ to observe a certain photon number $n$ is given\nby\n\\begin{eqnarray}\np_{\\textrm{pd}}(n)&=&\\frac{{\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}^{n}\\exp(-{\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle})}{n!},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the mean photon number is ${\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}={\\langle{{\\hat a^{\\dag}\\hat a}}\\rangle}$,\nwith the conventional creation (annihilation) operator $\\hat a^{\\dag}$ ($\\hat a$). \nThe standard deviation of the photon number is given by $\\Delta\nn=\\sqrt{{\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}}$ and for\n large ${\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}$ the intensity fluctuations become negligible.\nAssuming stationarity, the second order auto-correlation function   \n\\begin{eqnarray}\ng^{(2)}(\\tau)&=&\\frac{{\\langle{{:\\hat n(0)\\hat n(\\tau):}}\\rangle}}{{\\langle{{\\hat n(0)}}\\rangle}^{2}},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $:...:$ indicating normal ordering, is constant $g^{(2)}(\\tau)=1$.\nConventional laser radiation well above the laser threshold is a very accurate\nrealization of such coherent light.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\center  \n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Aufbau_skizze.eps}  \n\\caption{(Color online) (a) Sketch of the implemented Martienssen lamp.\n(b) Sketch of experimental setup: Polarization filtering\nused to distinguish resonant fluorescence (RF) from light source (LS).  \n Akronyms used in sketch: \nEOM \\textit{electro optical modulator},\n\nLP \\textit{linear polariser},\nMO \\textit{microscope objective}\nPBS \\textit{polarising beam splitter}\n\nSPCM \\textit{single photon counting module}   \n(c) Measured $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$-function of the chaotic light source.\nThe red, solid line is a fit of\n$f(\\tau)=~1~+~A~\\textrm{exp}(-\\pi(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{\\textrm{corr}})^2})$ to\nthe data giving a correlation time of 0.9\\,$\\mu$s.

For large \n${\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}$ the fluctuations of the photon number are on the order of the average photon number ${\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}$. Assuming stationarity, the Fourier transform of the spectrum\n$g^{(1)}(\\tau)={\\langle{{\\hat a^{\\dag}(0)\\hat a(\\tau)}}\\rangle}/{\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}$ of a\nchaotic light field determines its second order auto-correlation function:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\ng^{(2)}(\\tau)&=&1+|g^{(1)}(\\tau)|^{2}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nObviously  $g^{(2)}(0) = 2$, i.e. chaotic light shows photon bunching leading to considerable effects\n in non-linear spectroscopy, e.g. an enhanced two-photon\n absorption probability\\,\\cite{Carmele2009,Kazimierczuk2015,Boitier2009}.\nIdeal black-body radiation, or emission from an infinite number of independent emitters are natural sources \nof chaotic light\\,\\cite{Loudon2001}. \nHowever, as these sources have limited spectral brightness and \\'etendue, their\nuse in nonlinear spectroscopy is very restricted.\nTo circumvent these limitations, we implement a chaotic light source with a\nGaussian spectrum, also known as Martienssen \nlamp\\,\\cite{Martienssen1964,Arecchi1965, Martienssen1966}, by reflecting a\nfocused laser beam on a circular diffuser (1500\\,Grit) moving with a constant\nvelocity of $v \\approx  10$\\,m/s at a radius of 10\\,mm (see Fig.\\,1\\,(a)).\nThe diffuse reflection on the multitude of moving scatterers introduces Doppler\nbroadening of the spectrum and chaotic intensity fluctuations.\nFig.\\,1\\,(c) shows the measured second-order autocorrelation function of the\nused source, exhibiting a second-order correlation time of $\\tau^{(2)}_{\\textrm{corr}} =\n(901.8 \\pm 0.9)$\\,ns according to a Gaussian fit (red trace) of the correlation function. \nFurthermore, the $g^{(2)}(0)$ value of 2.05 shows that the source produces light\nwith almost perfect thermal statistics at an emission linewidth of 1.1 MHz,\nwhere the slight deviations can be attributed to mechanical instabilities of the setup leading to an increased\nbunching. \n\nAs TLS we use single self assembled InGaAs quantum dots grown by molecular beam\nepitaxy (MBE) embedded in a planar low-Q distributed Bragg reflector (DBR)\ncavity consisting of 24 lower and 5 upper mirror pairs. The presence of\nnaturally occurring, micron sized photonic defects on the sample enhances the\nbrightness of the photon flux\\,\\cite{Maier2014}.\nThe sample is mounted inside a helium flow cryostat and kept at a constant\ntemperature of 5.5\\,K.  \nFor experiments with coherent excitation light, we use a commercial continuous wave\n(cw) external cavity diode laser, while simultaneously a low\npower, non-resonant He-Ne laser ($<$\\,0.1\\,nW, 637\\,nm) is used to stabilize \nthe quantum dot fluorescence\\,\\cite{Nguyen2012}.\nDirectly reflected light is filtered by a combination of polarization and\nspatial filtering prior to detection, while photons scattered by the QD are\ndetected by a single photon counting module (SPCM) (cf. Fig.\\,1\\,(b)).\n\n\nFor simulating the coherent excitation experiments, we follow the\nsemi-classical Bloch equation approach\\,\\cite{Allen1975}.\nThis is well justified, as for laser powers $P$ on the order of a\nfew nW, the average photon numbers of the excitation ${\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}$ are large\nand the relative photon number fluctuations $\\delta  n= \\Delta n/{\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}$ vanish.\nIn this limit, the Rabi frequency $\\Omega \\sim \\sqrt{{\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle}}$ is fix, i.e. not subject to quantum fluctuations. \nIn this regime the resonance fluorescence intensity is directly\nproportional to the average exciton population\n${\\langle{{\\rho_{\\textrm{X}}(t)}}\\rangle}_{\\textrm{pd}}$. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]  \n\\center\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{Saett.eps} \n\\caption{(Color online) Blue (Black) dots: Saturation behaviour of\nTLS under coherent (chaotic) excitation.

It is a consequence of the interaction of a two level system\nwith an intense coherent light field and can be handily interpreted in\nthe framework of dressed states as was first proposed by Cohen-Tannoudji et al.\\,\\cite{Cohen-Tannoudji1977}.\nHowever, this picture only holds in the the case of ${\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle} \\gg\n{\\langle{{\\Delta \\hat{n}}}\\rangle} \\gg 1$, which is true for a coherent state but not\nfor chaotic light where ${\\langle{{\\hat n}}\\rangle} = {\\langle{{\\Delta \\hat{n}}}\\rangle}$. \nThus, for the chaotic case, it has been predicted that the two satellite peaks\nshould disappear\\,\\cite{Avan1977,Georges1979}.\n\n\n\nTo experimentally observe the satellite peaks which \nare purely part of the incoherently scattered fraction of the total fluorescence\nat high excitation power we use a scanning Fabry-Perot resonator with a free\nspectra range of 26.4\\,GHz (109.4\\,$\\mu eV$) and a resolution of 175.4\\,MHz\n(725.4\\,neV).\nPlotted in Fig.\\,4\\,(a) is the  right wing of the Mollow triplet (T-line) under\nstrict resonant excitation for three different average Rabi frequencies.\nThe satellite peak is clearly visible under coherent excitation.\nThe experimental data is in good agreement with the predicted power spectrum\nincluding pure dephasing \\cite{Matthiesen2012}.\nExcitation induced dephasing which leads to a broadening of the Mollow\nsidepeaks at high excitation power \\cite{Ulrich2011}, is not included in the\ntheory and therefore likely to cause the deviations between theory and experiment at higher\nRabi frequencies.\n\nIn contrast, under chaotic excitation (Fig.\\,4\\,(b)) the Mollow triplet cannot\nbe observed under otherwise identical excitation conditions.\nThis is again a direct consequence of the large intensity fluctuations present\nin the chaotic light field and can be quantitatively explained\nby averaging the power dependent spectra over the  photon number distribution given in Eq.

Superimposed onto the antibunching dip at $\\tau=0$, as is expected for a single TLS, pronounced bunching is observed for larger $\\tau$.\nThis is typical for resonance fluorescence experiments on QDs and is attributed\nto blinking of the QD\\,\\cite{Ulhaq2012}.   \nIn Fig.\\,5\\,(b) the same measurement is shown for chaotic excitation. Here, the\nantibunching is visible with an increased bunching compared to the coherent case.\nThus, as intuitively expected, the\nnon-classical nature of the emitted radiation is unaffected by the photon\nstatistics of the exciting light field.\nIn this regard, it is also noteworthy that without careful renormalisation of\nthe autocorrelation data no direct difference between the two types\nof excitation would be observable.\n \nIn conclusion, our experiments show that the response of a quantum mechanical two level system is very sensitive\nto the photon statistics of the exciting light field. While differences are already visible\nin the saturation behavior of the TLS, the more striking differences occur in\nthe transient regime, where Rabi oscillations are suppressed under chaotic\nexcitation.\nFurthermore, the emission spectrum under strong excitation depends dramatically\non the higher order correlation functions of the exciting light field. Thus, the\niconic Mollow triplet disappears under chaotic excitation.\nWith its nonlinear nature, the fermionic TLS is an ideal probe for the fluctuations present in the light field.\nFuture experiments will be directed towards exploring the regime of short correlation times in the excitation field,\nbeing on the order of or even shorter than the coherence time of the TLS. Also,\nextending photon-statistics excitation spectroscopy to non-classical light\nsources will be highly interesting.\n\nWe thank M. A\\ss mann and A.
