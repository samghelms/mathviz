Through joint membership matching, we deconstruct the \nmain Gaussian velocity component into its halo contributions, finding that the top-ranked halo contributes $\\sim 60\\%$ of the stacked signal. \nThe halo mass scale inferred by applying the virial scaling of \\cite{Evrard:2008} to the velocity\nnormalization matches, to within a few percent, the log-mean halo mass derived through galaxy membership matching.  We apply this approach, along with mis-centering and galaxy velocity bias corrections, to estimate the log-mean matched halo mass at $z=0.2$ of SDSS redMaPPer clusters.  Employing the velocity bias constraints of \\citet{GuoII:2015}, we find ${\\langle {\\ln(M_{200c})|\\lambda} \\rangle} = \\ln(M_{30}) + \\alpha_m \\ln(\\lambda/30)$ with $M_{30} = 1.56 \\pm 0.35 \\times 10^{14} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$ and $\\alpha_m = 1.31 \\pm 0.06_{stat} \\pm 0.13_{sys}$. \nSystematic uncertainty in the velocity bias of satellite galaxies overwhelmingly dominates the error budget.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\nmethods: statistical - galaxies: clusters: general - galaxies: haloes\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:Introduction}\n\nThe most massive dark matter halos to emerge in the universe host clusters of galaxies.  \nOngoing and near-future cosmological surveys are dedicated to identifying clusters for the purpose of studying cosmology and fundamental physics through spatiotemporal counts and other statistical properties of the cluster population \\citep[][]{Allen:2011}.   \nThe largest cluster samples are identified using photometric data, through color-based \\citep{GladdersYee:2005, Koester:2007, Dong:2008, Murphy:2012, Oguri:2014, Stanford:2014, Bleem:2015, Licitra:2016} or photometric redshift-based \\citep{Milkeraitis:2010, Durret:2011, Soares-Santos:2011} algorithms. \n\nPredicting such cluster counts for a given cosmology requires convolving the halo mass function (spatial number density as a function of mass and redshift) with a likelihood function linking observable cluster properties to total halo mass. As a result, the true halo mass of clusters is a crucial element in the methodology of cluster count cosmology.  \n\nBecause photometric data provides only coarse resolution in redshift, projection of galaxies along the line of sight to a massive halo limits the ability of cluster-finding algorithms to uniquely identify the galaxies that are members of a particular massive halo.  Spectroscopic data provides improved distance and mass estimators for group and cluster selection \\citep[e.g.,][]{Robotham:2011}, but projection and mis-centering still pose challenges for these methods \\citep[see e.g.][and references therein]{Duarte:2014}.  \n\nThese sources of confusion are fundamentally rooted in the fact that clusters and halos are identified in different spaces: sky-redshift or sky-color space for clusters and 3D real space or 6D phase space for halos.\nPeculiar velocities can blend distinct halos in real space into a single structure in redshift space \\citep[{\\sl e.g.},][]{vandenBosch:2004, Biviano:2006, Wojtak:2007, Saro:2013, Duarte:2014}.  In addition, the fact that high mass halos in cold dark matter cosmologies are dynamically evolving at late times means that substructure and mergers can create complex, transient phase-space structure.  In simulations, this complexity can confuse assignment of subhalos hosting galaxies to their parent halos \\citep{Knebe:2011}.  \n\nIn practice, assigning galaxies as members of either clusters or halos is a matter of convention, defined by application of specific, algorithm-dependent rules to galaxy samples.  Regardless of the particulars, the joint likelihood, $P_{\\alpha,i}(k)$ that a galaxy, $k$, is a member of both cluster $\\alpha$ and halo $i$ offers a means to map from one space to the other \\citep{Gerke:2005}.  \n\nThe total galaxy content, or \\emph{richness}, of a cluster can then be considered as a sum of partial contributions from halos closely aligned along a common sightline.  In this work, we apply such a membership-matching approach in simulations to build a network linking clusters to halos, with network edges weighted by fractional cluster membership.  \n\nWe investigate the membership properties of the redMaPPer cluster finding algorithm \\citep{Rykoff:2014}.  The method, which identifies clusters through their red sequence galaxy population, outputs background-corrected membership probabilities \\citep{Rozo:2009, Rykoff:2012} to each galaxy in a cluster as well as central galaxy probabilities for up to four cluster members.  The method is designed to make optimal use of data from large, multi-color photometric surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \\citep[SDSS,][]{SDSS-York:2000} and the Dark Energy Survey \\citep[DES,][]{DES-Flaugher:2005}.   \nThe SDSS redMaPPer cluster catalog \\citep{Rykoff:2014} has been extensively studied with multiwavelength data, including comparisons to existing X-ray and Planck satellite Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogs \\citep{Sadibekova:2014, RozoRykoff:2014, Rozo:2015, PlanckXXVII:2015}.\n\nThe latest study in the redMaPPer series uses stacked spectroscopic analysis of cluster member pairwise velocities to investigate photometrically assigned membership probabilities \\citep[][hereafter RMIV]{Rozo:2014}.  In that work, very good agreement was found between spectroscopic and photometric definitions of cluster membership after a small number of modest corrections for blue cluster members, correlated line-of-sight structure, and photometric noise.  \n\nUsing only SDSS data, the RMIV study could not study membership from the perspective of the underlying halo population.  \nInstead, spectroscopic members are defined in velocity space using an assumed Gaussian form for the pairwise velocity \nprobability density function (PDF) of central and satellite cluster members. In this work, we use simulations to link spectroscopic cluster members to the underlying halo population, leading to an estimate of the log-mean matched halo mass. \n\nIn \\S\\ref{sec:simulation}, we apply the redMaPPer algorithm to a 10,000 deg$^2$ synthetic photometric galaxy catalog derived from lightcone outputs of N-body simulations.  We then employ a membership-based matching algorithm, described in \\S\\ref{sec:matching}, to build bipartite graphs\\footnote{A bipartite graph links two disjoint sets of nodes, {\\sl U} and {\\sl V}, with edges, each of which connects a node in {\\sl U} with one in {\\sl V}.  In our case {\\sl U} is the set of clusters and {\\sl V} the set of halos.}\nin which each cluster links to a set of halos ranked by their fractional member contribution to that cluster, a measure we term membership {\\sl strength}. This method is used to deconstruct the stacked pairwise velocity distribution of central-satellite galaxies in \\S\\ref{sec:Halos-spectroscopic}.   \n\nIn \\S\\ref{sec:massCalibration}, we apply the N-body simulation-based virial scaling of \\citet{Evrard:2008} to estimate the total mass at fixed cluster richness from the velocity dispersion model of \\S\\ref{sec:Halos-spectroscopic}.  We show that this dynamical mass recovers the log-mean mass of halos matched by cluster membership to better than one percent. Confounding effects of mis-centering and velocity bias are then discussed.  Using current estimates for the magnitudes of these sources of systematic error, in \\S\\ref{sec:RMIVmass} we estimate the halo mass scale of the RMIV sample using their stacked velocity dispersion measurements.  \nOur results are summarized in \\S\\ref{sec:conclusion}.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, our convention for the mass of a halo is $M_{200c}$,  the mass contained within a spherical region encompassing a mean density equal to $200$ times the critical density of the universe, $\\rho_c(z)$. We also test the robustness of our results to the details of the synthetic galaxy population by implementing our analysis on an independent, higher-resolution simulation, populated with a different galaxy prescription.  Appendix \\ref{app:Bolshoi} summarizes these results.\n\n   \n\n\n\n\\section{Simulation samples and synthetic cluster catalog} \\label{sec:simulation}\n\nWe employ N-body simulations produced with a lightweight version of the Gadget code developed for the Millennium Simulation \\citep{Springel:2005}.  Three simulations, of $1.05$, $2.6$ and $4.0 {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm Gpc}}}$ volumes, are used to produce a sky survey realization covering 10,000 deg$^2$ that resolves all halos above $10^{13} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$ within $z \\le 2$.   We refer to this suite of runs as the Aardvark simulation.  \n\nThe resultant sky catalog is built by concatenating continuous lightcone output segments from the three different N-body volumes using the method described in \\citet{Evrard:2002}.  The smallest volume maps $z < 0.35$, the intermediate maps $0.35 \\le z < 1.1$ and the largest volume covers $1.1 \\le z < 2$.  The simulations employ $2048^3$ particles, except for the $1.0 {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm Gpc}}}$ volume which uses $1400^3$, and corresponding particle masses are $0.27$, $1.3$ and  $4.8 \\times 10^{11} {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$.   The Aardvark suite assumes a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with cosmological parameters: $\\Omega_m = 0.23$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.77$, $\\Omega_{b} = 0.047$, $\\sigma_8 = 0.83$, $h = 0.73$, and $n_s = 1.0$.  The Rockstar algorithm is used for halo finding \\citep{Behroozi:2013}.  \n\n\\subsection{Galaxy population and halo membership}\n\nGalaxy properties are assigned to particles using the ADDGALS algorithm \\citep{addgals1, addgals2,Chang2015,addgals3}.  The algorithm is empirical, using the observed $r$-band luminosity function and trend of galaxy color with local environment as input.  The method assigns central galaxies to resolved halos, but satellites as well as centrals in unresolved halos are assigned to dark matter particles in a probabilistic manner weighted by a local dark matter density estimate.  This density assignment scheme is tuned to match the clustering properties of a sub-halo assignment matching (SHAM) approach applied to a $400 {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}}{\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm Mpc}}}$ simulation using $2048^3$ particles.  \n\n\nCentral galaxies are placed at the center of resolved halos and assigned a velocity at rest relative to the halo's mean dark matter velocity within ${R_{\\rm 200c}}$.  We explore the issue of non-zero central galaxy velocities in the analysis below.  \nAll other galaxies are assigned the positions and velocities of the corresponding particles to which they are assigned.  Note that no particle can host more than one galaxy.   The velocity assignment implies that the velocity dispersion of central--satellite pairs is expected to follow the same scaling with halo mass as that identified in the simulation ensemble of \\citet{Evrard:2008}.  \n\nRegarding halo membership, our convention is that a galaxy, $n$, is assigned to one and only one halo.  Thus, if galaxy $n$ is assigned to halo $j$, then the probability that galaxy $n$\nbelongs to halo $i$ is ${P_{{\\rm halo},i} }(n) = \\delta_{ij}$.  A spherical region of radius ${R_{\\rm 200c}}$ is used when defining halo membership.  \nThis region approximately defines the hydrostatic region of massive halos but it does not extend to the \nouter caustic, or backsplash, edge which contains a mix of infalling and outgoing material \\citep{Busha:2005, Cuesta:2008, More:2015}. \nWe note that ${R_{\\rm 200c}}$ is similar in scale to the search radius used by the {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} cluster finding algorithm. In regions where two or more halos spatially overlap, the galaxy is assigned to the nearest halo.  \nIn the ADDGALS algorithm, galaxies can reside outside of a resolved N-body halo; $13\\%$ of $m_i < 19$ galaxies reside beyond ${R_{\\rm 200c}}$ of a resolved halo. \n\nWhile not strictly a halo occupation distribution (HOD) method, ADDGALS produces an effective HOD for which intrinsic richness scales as a power law with halo mass.  At low redshift, $\\lambda_{\\rm int}$, defined as the number of galaxies with $M_r - 5 \\log h \\le  -19$ within ${R_{\\rm 200c}}$, scales with halo mass in a sub-linear fashion, $\\lambda_{\\rm int} \\propto M^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha \\sim 0.8$.  To test the robustness of our conclusions to the intrinsic HOD structure of massive halos, we repeat the analysis on the galaxy catalogs of \\citet{Hearin:2013} extracted from the Bolshoi simulation, which have a slightly steeper slope, $\\alpha \\sim 1.0$, and smaller intrinsic scatter in $\\lambda_{\\rm int}$ compared to the Aardvark galaxy catalog.  Further details are provided in Appendix~\\ref{app:Bolshoi}.  \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n   \\centering\n   \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{plots/colMag-diag-Aardvark.pdf}\n \\caption{Color--magnitude diagram for Aardvark simulation galaxies occupying halos of mass ${M_{\\rm 200c}} > 10^{14} {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}}{\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$ in the redshift interval $0.19 < z < 0.21$.  The line indicates the red sequence ridge-line, $g-r = 1.65 - 0.32 \\, m_r$; $78\\%$ of galaxies brighter than $m_i = 19$ lie within 0.2 mag of this ridge-line.  } \n   \\label{fig:colorMag} \n\\end{figure}\n\nThe {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} algorithm assumes that red galaxies are the prominent population occupying high mass halos.  In \nFigure~\\ref{fig:colorMag}, we show the distribution of $g-r$ color as a function of $r$-band magnitude, $m_r$, for Aardvark galaxies in halos of mass ${M_{\\rm 200c}} > 10^{14} {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}}{\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$, and in the narrow redshift interval, $0.19 < z < 0.21$.   A red sequence is evident, containing $78\\%$ of galaxies brighter than $19^{\\rm th}$ magnitude. The line shows the ridge-line approximate red sequence population. The slope and intercept are consistent with those found in SDSS analysis of \\citet[][see their Fig.~11]{Hao:2009} for the same redshift range. \n \nWhile the ADDGALS method uses a local dark matter density to assign galaxy luminosity to particles, the smoothing scale employed to calculate the local density leaves the inner $\\sim 100 {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm kpc}}}$ of high mass halos relatively devoid of galaxies other than the central.  As a result of this and possibly other factors, the frequency of mis-centered clusters is larger in the Aardvark {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} cluster catalog than in the observed SDSS sample.  We therefore work with two different cluster samples, consisting of the correctly centered subset (denoted CEN) as well as the full set of identified {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} clusters (ALL). \nThe exact definition of these two samples is given in \\S\\ref{sec:specSamples}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Cluster finding with redMaPPer} \\label{sec:redMaPPer-cluster-finder}\n\nCluster finding methods that use only optical photometry fall into two main categories based on whether the method uses colors directly or photometric redshifts derived from those colors.  The {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} algorithm is in the former category; it uses colors, along with training spectroscopy, to track the multi-band location of the red sequence as a function of redshift \\citep{Rykoff:2014}.  \nWe note that {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }}\\ is continuously updated, so there is no unique {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }}\\ catalog.  Here, we rely on the {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }}\\ v5.10 SDSS catalog, as this constitutes the most recently\npublicly available version. \n\n\nThe {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} cluster finder is a matched filter algorithm with components that characterize the luminosity function, red-sequence color, and projected number density of cluster galaxies.  Writing the projected galaxy distribution in sky-magnitude space as a sum of cluster members and a locally-uniform background component, the algorithm works iteratively to eventually tag each galaxy in the vicinity of a cluster, $\\alpha$, with a probability, ${P_{\\rm mem, \\alpha}}$ of being a member of that cluster.   The richness, $\\lambda$, is defined as the sum of the membership probabilities over the set, $G_\\alpha$, of all member galaxies\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \n  \\lambda_{\\alpha} = \\sum\\limits_{n \\in G_{\\alpha}} {P_{\\rm mem, \\alpha}}(n) .\n\\label{eq:lambda}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\lambda_{\\alpha}=\\sum\\limits_{n\\in G_{\\alpha}}{P_{\\rm mem,\\alpha}}(n).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bb</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msub></mrow></munder><mrow><msub><mi>P</mi><mrow><mi>mem</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05773.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $G_{\\alpha} \\equiv \\{ID\\}_{\\alpha}$ is the list of galaxy ID's associated with cluster $\\alpha$, $P_{halo,i}(n)$ is a boolean set to 1 if galaxy $n$ is a member of halo $i$, as described in \\S~\\ref{sec:simulation}.

That work uses age distribution matching, a method for predicting how galaxies of magnitude $r$ and color $g-r$ occupy haloes, to populate halos with galaxies at redshift $z=0$.  \nWhen using the galaxy catalog from the Bolshoi simulation, we rely on a $z=0$ snapshot rather than a properly constructed lightcone.  We note the \\citet{Hearin:2013} catalog has only $g$ and $r$\ndata available, rather than the full 5-band photometry available in the SDSS and Aardvark.\n\nResults of this exercise, details of which are given in Appendix~\\ref{app:Bolshoi}, produce a velocity PDF of similar shape to the Aardvark CEN sub-sample. The best-fit parameters show a similar Gaussian magnitude, $p=0.89$, but a shallower slope, $\\alpha = 0.30$, that reflects the steeper HOD slope in the Bolshoi galaxy catalog compared to the Aardvark galaxy catalog.  \n\n\n\nAs found by RMIV, the best-fit model does not have an acceptable $\\chi^2$, as reflected by the deviations seen in the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters}.   \nWe show below that the deviations from the simple flat-plus-Gaussian model arise from galaxies lying along the line of sight in halos outside the matched halo.\n \n\n\\subsection{Halo-ranked contributions to the velocity PDF} \\label{sec:Halos-contribution}\n \nThe cluster--halo membership network allows us to determine what fraction of pairs in the main Gaussian PDF component arise from the matched halo.  For the CEN sample, we find that, on average, $62 \\%$ of galaxy pairs arise from within the matched halo.  For the full sample, the mean value decreases somewhat, to $58\\%$.  For the Bolshoi catalog, in which all clusters are correctly centered by construction, the mean is somewhat larger, $70\\%$. \n \nThe middle panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters} shows only the matched halo's contribution to the pairwise velocity PDF of the CEN sample.  As before, error bars are produced via bootstrap resampling of the cluster sample using $50$ bins between $-5$ and $5$ in $v/\\sigma_v$. The black line shows a Gaussian with dispersion given by the best fit to the entire spectroscopic sample (left panel), listed in Table~\\ref{tab:specBestFit}.  The principal \ndifference with the left panel is that we force $p=1$, meaning no background component. While there exists moderate kurtosis in this distribution, the high velocity wings of the PDF are not well populated.  \n\nThe good match seen in the middle panel is important in that it indicates that the best-fit velocity derived from the  spectroscopic data set accurately recovers the velocity dispersion of the top-ranked halo.  This finding offers leverage for a mean dynamical mass estimate as a function of cluster richness that we explore in the next section.  \n \nThe right hand panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters} shows the contribution from satellite galaxies outside of the matched halo.  Clearly, a constant background does not adequately capture this component, which is a sum over second and higher-ranked halos.  \nFor the CEN sample, an average of $38\\%$ of spectroscopic pairs are not contributed by the top-ranked halo.  Of this total, an average of $10\\%$ and $5\\%$ come from the second- and third-ranked halo, respectively.  The remaining $23\\%$ is contributed by fourth and higher ranked halos, with $12\\%$ in unresolved halos below our mass resolution limit. \n\n\nFor the full sample (ALL), the overall non-matched halo fraction is slightly higher, $42\\%$, with $12\\%$ and $6\\%$ arising from the second and third halo terms.   \n\nSimilar results have been found in prior simulation studies.  \nUsing a spectroscopic group finder based on a Voronoi-Delaunay tesselation, \\citet{Gerke:2005} and \\citet{Gerke:2012} find that $70\\%$ of cluster galaxies truly belong to the matched host halo, on average. \nThough they use a completely different group finder algorithm, their conclusion regarding the level of interloper galaxies is consistent with the results of our spectroscopic analysis. \nIn a different study, \\citet{Mamon:2010}\nfinds the density of interloping dark matter particles in redshift space around massive halos takes the form of a constant component plus a quasi-Gaussian component, similar to the structure seen in the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters}.  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\\section{Mass Estimation} \n\\label{sec:massCalibration}\n\n\nIn this section we derive a scaling relation between total mass and optical richness by applying the virial velocity scaling of massive halos to the pairwise velocity dispersion model described above. We compare this stacked dynamical mass to that derived from membership matching to halos, and find excellent agreement with the log-mean matched mass at fixed richness.  \n\nWe begin by using the CEN sample to avoid uncertainties caused by mis-centering, then investigate mis-centering in \\S\\ref{sec:miscentering}.  \n\n\\subsection{Cluster mass from dark matter virial scaling} \\label{sec:virialScaling}\n\nThe classical virial theorem balances the kinetic energy with (modulo surface terms) half the gravitational potential energy of a halo, thereby offering a scaling law between velocity dispersion and mass within an enclosed radius.  In a study of multiple, independent N-body and adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations, \\citet[][hereafter, E08]{Evrard:2008} calibrated the dark matter virial relation. \n\nIn that work, the one-dimensional velocity dispersion of a halo, $\\sigma_h$, is defined in an orientation-averaged fashion using particles within ${R_{\\rm 200c}}$.  The dispersion is measured with respect to the mean dark matter velocity within that radius. \n\nE08 showed that the halo velocity dispersion of the population follows a power-law form with approximately log-normal scatter, meaning the conditional probability, $P(\\ln (\\sigma_h) | M,z) = {\\cal{N}} (\\ln (\\sigma_{\\rm DM}(M,z)),0.046)$, where $\\cal{N}$ denotes a normal distribution, $\\sigma_{\\rm DM}(M,z)$ is the log-mean velocity dispersion at fixed mass and redshift, and $0.046$ is the scatter in $\\ln (\\sigma_h)$ at fixed mass.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\includegraphics[width=0.65\\textwidth]{plots/lam-M200-calib.pdf}\n   \\caption{The mass--richness scaling relationship derived from application of the virial relation to stacked central satellite velocities, Equation~(\\ref{eq:VTmass}), (solid black line) at redshift $0.2$ is compared to halo masses of correctly-centered redMaPPer clusters derived from galaxy membership matching in the redshift range $[0.1,0.3]$ (circles).

That work uses age distribution matching, a method for predicting how galaxies of magnitude $r$ and color $g-r$ occupy haloes, to populate halos with galaxies at redshift $z=0$.  \nWhen using the galaxy catalog from the Bolshoi simulation, we rely on a $z=0$ snapshot rather than a properly constructed lightcone.  We note the \\citet{Hearin:2013} catalog has only $g$ and $r$\ndata available, rather than the full 5-band photometry available in the SDSS and Aardvark.\n\nResults of this exercise, details of which are given in Appendix~\\ref{app:Bolshoi}, produce a velocity PDF of similar shape to the Aardvark CEN sub-sample. The best-fit parameters show a similar Gaussian magnitude, $p=0.89$, but a shallower slope, $\\alpha = 0.30$, that reflects the steeper HOD slope in the Bolshoi galaxy catalog compared to the Aardvark galaxy catalog.  \n\n\n\nAs found by RMIV, the best-fit model does not have an acceptable $\\chi^2$, as reflected by the deviations seen in the left panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters}.   \nWe show below that the deviations from the simple flat-plus-Gaussian model arise from galaxies lying along the line of sight in halos outside the matched halo.\n \n\n\\subsection{Halo-ranked contributions to the velocity PDF} \\label{sec:Halos-contribution}\n \nThe cluster--halo membership network allows us to determine what fraction of pairs in the main Gaussian PDF component arise from the matched halo.  For the CEN sample, we find that, on average, $62 \\%$ of galaxy pairs arise from within the matched halo.  For the full sample, the mean value decreases somewhat, to $58\\%$.  For the Bolshoi catalog, in which all clusters are correctly centered by construction, the mean is somewhat larger, $70\\%$. \n \nThe middle panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters} shows only the matched halo's contribution to the pairwise velocity PDF of the CEN sample.  As before, error bars are produced via bootstrap resampling of the cluster sample using $50$ bins between $-5$ and $5$ in $v/\\sigma_v$. The black line shows a Gaussian with dispersion given by the best fit to the entire spectroscopic sample (left panel), listed in Table~\\ref{tab:specBestFit}.  The principal \ndifference with the left panel is that we force $p=1$, meaning no background component. While there exists moderate kurtosis in this distribution, the high velocity wings of the PDF are not well populated.  \n\nThe good match seen in the middle panel is important in that it indicates that the best-fit velocity derived from the  spectroscopic data set accurately recovers the velocity dispersion of the top-ranked halo.  This finding offers leverage for a mean dynamical mass estimate as a function of cluster richness that we explore in the next section.  \n \nThe right hand panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters} shows the contribution from satellite galaxies outside of the matched halo.  Clearly, a constant background does not adequately capture this component, which is a sum over second and higher-ranked halos.  \nFor the CEN sample, an average of $38\\%$ of spectroscopic pairs are not contributed by the top-ranked halo.  Of this total, an average of $10\\%$ and $5\\%$ come from the second- and third-ranked halo, respectively.  The remaining $23\\%$ is contributed by fourth and higher ranked halos, with $12\\%$ in unresolved halos below our mass resolution limit. \n\n\nFor the full sample (ALL), the overall non-matched halo fraction is slightly higher, $42\\%$, with $12\\%$ and $6\\%$ arising from the second and third halo terms.   \n\nSimilar results have been found in prior simulation studies.  \nUsing a spectroscopic group finder based on a Voronoi-Delaunay tesselation, \\citet{Gerke:2005} and \\citet{Gerke:2012} find that $70\\%$ of cluster galaxies truly belong to the matched host halo, on average. \nThough they use a completely different group finder algorithm, their conclusion regarding the level of interloper galaxies is consistent with the results of our spectroscopic analysis. \nIn a different study, \\citet{Mamon:2010}\nfinds the density of interloping dark matter particles in redshift space around massive halos takes the form of a constant component plus a quasi-Gaussian component, similar to the structure seen in the right panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:velocityDispersionClusters}.  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\\section{Mass Estimation} \n\\label{sec:massCalibration}\n\n\nIn this section we derive a scaling relation between total mass and optical richness by applying the virial velocity scaling of massive halos to the pairwise velocity dispersion model described above. We compare this stacked dynamical mass to that derived from membership matching to halos, and find excellent agreement with the log-mean matched mass at fixed richness.  \n\nWe begin by using the CEN sample to avoid uncertainties caused by mis-centering, then investigate mis-centering in \\S\\ref{sec:miscentering}.  \n\n\\subsection{Cluster mass from dark matter virial scaling} \\label{sec:virialScaling}\n\nThe classical virial theorem balances the kinetic energy with (modulo surface terms) half the gravitational potential energy of a halo, thereby offering a scaling law between velocity dispersion and mass within an enclosed radius.  In a study of multiple, independent N-body and adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations, \\citet[][hereafter, E08]{Evrard:2008} calibrated the dark matter virial relation. \n\nIn that work, the one-dimensional velocity dispersion of a halo, $\\sigma_h$, is defined in an orientation-averaged fashion using particles within ${R_{\\rm 200c}}$.  The dispersion is measured with respect to the mean dark matter velocity within that radius. \n\nE08 showed that the halo velocity dispersion of the population follows a power-law form with approximately log-normal scatter, meaning the conditional probability, $P(\\ln (\\sigma_h) | M,z) = {\\cal{N}} (\\ln (\\sigma_{\\rm DM}(M,z)),0.046)$, where $\\cal{N}$ denotes a normal distribution, $\\sigma_{\\rm DM}(M,z)$ is the log-mean velocity dispersion at fixed mass and redshift, and $0.046$ is the scatter in $\\ln (\\sigma_h)$ at fixed mass.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\includegraphics[width=0.65\\textwidth]{plots/lam-M200-calib.pdf}\n   \\caption{The mass--richness scaling relationship derived from application of the virial relation to stacked central satellite velocities, Equation~(\\ref{eq:VTmass}), (solid black line) at redshift $0.2$ is compared to halo masses of correctly-centered redMaPPer clusters derived from galaxy membership matching in the redshift range $[0.1,0.3]$ (circles).

Differences are less than $1 \\%$ at the pivot point and within $\\sim 5\\%$ over a broad range in richness.

The normalizations at the $\\lambda=30$ pivot are consistent, while the slopes are in mild tension at the level of 0.13 in their central value.  An ensemble of simulated samples would be useful to reduce the statistical error on the membership matched slope. \n\n\nWe turn next to discuss sources of systematic uncertainty before applying this method to derive a constraint the matched halo masses of RMIV clusters.\n\n\n\\subsection{Sources of Systematic Uncertainty}\n\nThe good agreement between stacked dynamical mass and membership-matched masses offers strong incentive to combine large photometric and spectroscopic galaxy samples to relate cluster richness to halo mass.  \n\nApplying this method to survey data introduces several sources of systematic error that must be modeled.  The Aardvark synthetic sky realization is idealized in several respects; central galaxies are at rest with respect to their underlying halo and satellite galaxies trace the kinematics of the dark matter.  Also, the differences in stacked pairwise velocity model parameters for the CEN and ALL samples indicate that mis-centering plays an additional role.  In addition, variance in the velocity dispersion of clusters of fixed richness, reflective of the variance in matched halo mass, can introduce bias.  \n\nThe following sections address these issues in turn, finding that the first two are more important than the third. How satellite galaxies trace dark matter kinematics is the key source of systematic error.  \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Central galaxy velocities and satellite galaxy velocity bias} \\label{sec:velocityBias}\n\nThe degree to which galaxy velocities trace the kinematics of dark matter particles in halos is a central issue for virial mass calibration. \nBy construction, the central galaxy is at rest with respect to its host halo in our simulations. In reality, central galaxies are measured to have a non-zero velocity dispersion with respect to their host clusters.  \n\nIn cases of actively merging systems the rest frame of a cluster is often difficult to define.  In the post-merger phase, the central galaxy will settle to the center of cluster due to dynamical friction on a timescale on the order of $1 {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm Gyr}}}$ \\citep{White:1976, Bird:1994}, during which time the central galaxy will have a net velocity with respect to the full halo. \nBased on a sample of nearly 500 Abell clusters with 10 or more redshifts, \\citet{Cozoil:2009} find that brightest cluster galaxies have velocities with root mean square magnitude $\\sim 0.3 \\sigma_{\\rm cl}$, with $\\sigma_{\\rm cl}$ the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the host cluster.  A similar ratio of $0.25$ is found by \\citet{Lauer:2014} using 178 clusters with 50 or more member spectra.  \\citet{Martel:2014} find a similar thermal motion for central galaxies in a sample of 18 massive halos extracted from a large cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation.  \n\nRedshift-space distortion studies also support non-zero values for central galaxy velocities \\citep{skibba:2011,Guo:2015,GuoII:2015}. If the central galaxy population has velocity dispersion scaling as some fraction, $\\alpha_{\\rm c}$, of the host halo dispersion, \n$\\sigma_{\\rm cen} = \\alpha_{\\rm c} \\sigma_{\\rm halo}$, then the central--satellite pairwise velocity normalization, $\\sigma_p$, will be enhanced by a factor $(1+\\alpha_{\\rm c}^2)^{1/2} \\simeq 1+ \\alpha_{\\rm c}^2/2$, the latter if $\\alpha_{\\rm c}$ is small compared to unity. Mass estimates derived from virial scaling will be boosted by a factor $(1+\\alpha_{\\rm c}^2)^{3/2} \\simeq 1+ 3\\alpha_{\\rm c}^2/2$ relative to the case of cold centrals ($\\alpha_c=0$).  These factors assume that the satellite galaxy velocities are unbiased with respect to the dark matter. \n\nThe velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies relative to the halo rest frame may also biased  \\citep{Carlberg:1994}, so that  \n$\\sigma_{\\rm sat} \\ = \\ \\alpha_{\\rm s}  \\ \\sigma_{\\rm DM}$,\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\rm s}$ is the satellite galaxy velocity bias. \nThe simulation study of \\citet{Wu:2013} that combines N-body and hydrodynamic models indicates that $\\alpha_{\\rm s}$ lies near unity, with brighter galaxies tending to have values less than one and fainter galaxies slightly above unity, asymptotically reaching a value of $1.05$.  This pattern is not seen in the redshift-space distortion work of \\citet{Guo:2015}, discussed below.\n\nLet $\\sigma_{p,0}$ be the normalization of the central--satellite pairwise velocity dispersion determined through the simulation analysis presented in \\S\\ref{sec:CSresults}.  Recall that the simulations are constructed to have $\\alpha_{\\rm c} = 0$ and $\\alpha_{\\rm s} = 1$.

The Aardvark synthetic sky realization is idealized in several respects; central galaxies are at rest with respect to their underlying halo and satellite galaxies trace the kinematics of the dark matter.  Also, the differences in stacked pairwise velocity model parameters for the CEN and ALL samples indicate that mis-centering plays an additional role.  In addition, variance in the velocity dispersion of clusters of fixed richness, reflective of the variance in matched halo mass, can introduce bias.  \n\nThe following sections address these issues in turn, finding that the first two are more important than the third. How satellite galaxies trace dark matter kinematics is the key source of systematic error.  \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Central galaxy velocities and satellite galaxy velocity bias} \\label{sec:velocityBias}\n\nThe degree to which galaxy velocities trace the kinematics of dark matter particles in halos is a central issue for virial mass calibration. \nBy construction, the central galaxy is at rest with respect to its host halo in our simulations. In reality, central galaxies are measured to have a non-zero velocity dispersion with respect to their host clusters.  \n\nIn cases of actively merging systems the rest frame of a cluster is often difficult to define.  In the post-merger phase, the central galaxy will settle to the center of cluster due to dynamical friction on a timescale on the order of $1 {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm Gyr}}}$ \\citep{White:1976, Bird:1994}, during which time the central galaxy will have a net velocity with respect to the full halo. \nBased on a sample of nearly 500 Abell clusters with 10 or more redshifts, \\citet{Cozoil:2009} find that brightest cluster galaxies have velocities with root mean square magnitude $\\sim 0.3 \\sigma_{\\rm cl}$, with $\\sigma_{\\rm cl}$ the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the host cluster.  A similar ratio of $0.25$ is found by \\citet{Lauer:2014} using 178 clusters with 50 or more member spectra.  \\citet{Martel:2014} find a similar thermal motion for central galaxies in a sample of 18 massive halos extracted from a large cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation.  \n\nRedshift-space distortion studies also support non-zero values for central galaxy velocities \\citep{skibba:2011,Guo:2015,GuoII:2015}. If the central galaxy population has velocity dispersion scaling as some fraction, $\\alpha_{\\rm c}$, of the host halo dispersion, \n$\\sigma_{\\rm cen} = \\alpha_{\\rm c} \\sigma_{\\rm halo}$, then the central--satellite pairwise velocity normalization, $\\sigma_p$, will be enhanced by a factor $(1+\\alpha_{\\rm c}^2)^{1/2} \\simeq 1+ \\alpha_{\\rm c}^2/2$, the latter if $\\alpha_{\\rm c}$ is small compared to unity. Mass estimates derived from virial scaling will be boosted by a factor $(1+\\alpha_{\\rm c}^2)^{3/2} \\simeq 1+ 3\\alpha_{\\rm c}^2/2$ relative to the case of cold centrals ($\\alpha_c=0$).  These factors assume that the satellite galaxy velocities are unbiased with respect to the dark matter. \n\nThe velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies relative to the halo rest frame may also biased  \\citep{Carlberg:1994}, so that  \n$\\sigma_{\\rm sat} \\ = \\ \\alpha_{\\rm s}  \\ \\sigma_{\\rm DM}$,\nwhere $\\alpha_{\\rm s}$ is the satellite galaxy velocity bias. \nThe simulation study of \\citet{Wu:2013} that combines N-body and hydrodynamic models indicates that $\\alpha_{\\rm s}$ lies near unity, with brighter galaxies tending to have values less than one and fainter galaxies slightly above unity, asymptotically reaching a value of $1.05$.

The mis-centering correction to the slope, $\\alpha$, is smaller than $0.01$ and is not applied below.  \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Velocity dispersion variance at fixed richness} \\label{sec:scatterEffect}\n\n\nThe satellite--central velocity likelihood model employs a single Gaussian of width $\\sigma_p(\\lambda,z)$ at fixed richness, $\\lambda$, but there is non-zero variance in velocity dispersion values of a fixed-$\\lambda$ population that reflects the variance in matched halo mass.  Scatter in halo mass at fixed lambda is already incorporated into the simulations; the scatter in matched halo masses shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:calMass} is $0.85$ in $\\ln M$.   We perform here an explicit test, independent of the simulated samples, to confirm that this scatter does not strongly affect the recovered velocity PDF parameters.  \n\nWe create ensembles of 10,000 galaxy pairs drawn from Gaussian distributions with dispersion values log-normally distributed about a scaling mean relation, $\\sigma_p(\\lambda,z)$, equation~\\ref{eq:velocityDispersion} with variance $\\sigma_{\\ln \\sigma}^2$. Sampling in $\\lambda$ and redshift uniformly covers the observed ranges of $[20,200]$ and $[0.1,0.3]$, respectively.  We then perform the stacked velocity PDF analysis on each simulated pair ensemble.  \n\nWe find that the model parameters remain unbiased until $\\sigma_{\\ln \\sigma} > 0.2$, after which the tails of the velocity distribution begin to affect the normalization $p$ at the one percent or greater level. The recovered values of $\\sigma_p$ and $\\alpha$, the key parameters involved in mass estimation, are unaffected up to values of $\\sigma_{\\ln \\sigma} = 0.5$, or $1.5$ scatter in $\\ln M$. This degree of mass scatter is larger than either the simulated or observed \\citep{redMaPPerII:2014} values.  \nVariance in host halo velocity dispersion at fixed richness is therefore a negligible source of systematic error in the velocity PDF modeling and resultant mass estimates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Stacked Dynamical Mass Scaling of SDSS redMaPPer Clusters }\\label{sec:RMIVmass}\n\nThe above analysis indicates that the mass determined through virial scaling of the pairwise velocity PDF normalization offers an unbiased estimate of the log-mean mass of halos matched via joint gaalxy membership.  \n\nWe now turn to estimate the characteristic $M_{200c}$ mass scale of correctly centered {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} clusters as a function of richness $\\lambda$ at the pivot redshift $z_p=0.2$. Recall from \\S\\ref{sec:velocityBias} and \\ref{sec:miscentering} that the pairwise velocity normalization depends on the mis-centering frequency and the velocity bias of central and satellite galaxies.  We need to estimate the magnitudes of these effects, and their uncertainties, into our mass estimate. \n\nThe normalization correction for mis-centering, assuming $f_{\\rm cen} = 0.85 \\pm 0.05$ for the SDSS {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} sample, is already incorporated into the correctly-centered estimate given in equation~(\\ref{eq:sigmaRMIVCC}).   \n\nTo estimate the velocity dispersion of the underlying dark matter from the pairwise satellite--central galaxy measurements, we need to divide the latter by the quadrature sum of the respective velocity bias factors, \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 56067, "prevtext": "\n\nIf these effects alone are responsible for the normalization difference between the SDSS and Aardvark CEN samples (see Table~\\ref{tab:specBestFit}), then we would require $(\\alpha_{\\rm s}^2 + \\alpha_{\\rm c}^2)^{1/2} = 1.13$.   \n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Cluster mis-centering} \\label{sec:miscentering}\n\nWhile the analysis of \\S\\ref{sec:CSresults} focused on the well-centered  subsample of clusters, the pairwise velocity PDF of the full sample has a similar form.

Scatter in halo mass at fixed lambda is already incorporated into the simulations; the scatter in matched halo masses shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:calMass} is $0.85$ in $\\ln M$.   We perform here an explicit test, independent of the simulated samples, to confirm that this scatter does not strongly affect the recovered velocity PDF parameters.  \n\nWe create ensembles of 10,000 galaxy pairs drawn from Gaussian distributions with dispersion values log-normally distributed about a scaling mean relation, $\\sigma_p(\\lambda,z)$, equation~\\ref{eq:velocityDispersion} with variance $\\sigma_{\\ln \\sigma}^2$. Sampling in $\\lambda$ and redshift uniformly covers the observed ranges of $[20,200]$ and $[0.1,0.3]$, respectively.  We then perform the stacked velocity PDF analysis on each simulated pair ensemble.  \n\nWe find that the model parameters remain unbiased until $\\sigma_{\\ln \\sigma} > 0.2$, after which the tails of the velocity distribution begin to affect the normalization $p$ at the one percent or greater level. The recovered values of $\\sigma_p$ and $\\alpha$, the key parameters involved in mass estimation, are unaffected up to values of $\\sigma_{\\ln \\sigma} = 0.5$, or $1.5$ scatter in $\\ln M$. This degree of mass scatter is larger than either the simulated or observed \\citep{redMaPPerII:2014} values.  \nVariance in host halo velocity dispersion at fixed richness is therefore a negligible source of systematic error in the velocity PDF modeling and resultant mass estimates. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Stacked Dynamical Mass Scaling of SDSS redMaPPer Clusters }\\label{sec:RMIVmass}\n\nThe above analysis indicates that the mass determined through virial scaling of the pairwise velocity PDF normalization offers an unbiased estimate of the log-mean mass of halos matched via joint gaalxy membership.  \n\nWe now turn to estimate the characteristic $M_{200c}$ mass scale of correctly centered {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} clusters as a function of richness $\\lambda$ at the pivot redshift $z_p=0.2$.

The matched halo of a cluster maximizes this strength.  \n  \nWe then study pairwise velocities, and derived masses, from stacked spectroscopic analysis of clusters patterned after the \nspectroscopic analysis of SDSS redMaPPer clusters developed by RMIV.  The structure in the simulated data is similar to that of the observations, with galaxy pairwise velocities having a main Gaussian provisionally identified as cluster members.  We employ a sub-sample of correctly centered clusters --- those for which the central cluster galaxy is also the central galaxy of the matched halo --- as well as studying the full simulated cluster sample.  \n\nWe then use our findings to estimate the log-mean, membership-matched mass of SDSS {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} clusters at $z=0.2$.  Our detailed results are as follows.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The pairwise velocity PDF has a main component that is reasonably well modeled as a Gaussian, with richness and redshift dependent width, plus a constant.  Decomposing this main  component into halo contributions, we find that the top-ranked, matched halo contributes an average of $62 \\%$ ($58\\%$) of pairs in the correctly centered (full) cluster samples.  The second-ranked halo contributes $\\sim 10\\%$, the third $\\sim 5 \\%$, and the remainder contribute $\\sim 20\\%$, in the mean.  The projected component, consisting of all galaxy pairs not contributed by the top-ranked matched halo, has a pairwise velocity PDF described roughly by a Gaussian plus constant form.\n\n\\item Converting the velocity dispersion--richness relation to a mass--richness relation using the dark matter virial relation calibrated by independent simulations  \\citep{Evrard:2008}, we find this stacked dynamical mass recovers, to within a few percent, the log-mean mass determined from membership matching between clusters and halos. \n\n\\item We model effects of cluster mis-centering and galaxy velocity bias in order to correct the measured {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} cluster velocity dispersion to reflect that of correctly centered, dark matter halos.  Using central and satellite velocity bias parameters $\\alpha_c=0.30 \\pm 0.05$ and $\\alpha_c=1.05 \\pm 0.08$, respectively \\citep{Guo:2015}, we infer a log-mean matched halo mass of $M_{200,p} = (1.56 \\pm 0.35) \\times 10^{14} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$ at the pivot richness, $\\lambda_p = 30$, and redshift $z_p = 0.2$, and a slope with richness of $1.31 \\pm 0.06_{stat} \\pm 0.13_{sys} $ for SDSS {\\ifthenelse{\\equal{\\arabic{RMDone}}{0}}{redMaPPer \\setcounter{RMDone}{1}}{redMaPPer }} clusters.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nKinematic biases of central and, especially, satellite galaxies, are the dominant source of systematic error.  Further work is needed, both empirically and through hydrodynamic simulations, to better constrain the relationship between galaxy velocities and dark matter. One possible approach is to invert the analysis presented here; comparing the stacked dynamical masses with stacked weak lensing masses of the same sample with the aim of constraining velocity bias. \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgment}\n\nWe acknowledge support from the DOE Office of Science grant DE-SC0007859.

The method relates galaxy luminosity to sub-halo size, and assigns color to formation epoch at fixed size, with older systems being redder. Table~\\ref{tab:HODtable} compares the HOD properties of the Aardvark and Bolshoi catalogs.  The slope and intrinsic scatter for a luminosity cut, $M_r -5\\log h = -19$, are given for halo samples limited in mass above $M_{200c} = 2 \\times 10^{14} {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$ (Aardvark) and $M_{vir} = 10^{14} {\\ensuremath{\\, h^{-1}}} {\\ensuremath{\\, {\\rm M}_\\odot}}$ (Bolshoi).
