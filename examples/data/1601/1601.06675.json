In this letter we use first principles density functional theory based electronic structure of Cu interconnects to find the lower limits of their line resistance for metal linewidths corresponding to future technology nodes. We find that even in the absence of scattering due to grain boundaries, edge roughness or interfaces, quantum confinement causes a severe reduction in current carrying capacity of Cu. We discuss the causes of transport orientation dependent anisotropy of quantum confinement in Cu. We also find that when the simplest scattering mechanism in the grain boundary scattering dominated limit is added to otherwise coherent electronic transmission in monocrystalline nanowires, the lower limits of line resistance are significantly higher than projected roadmap requirements in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n                             \n\n                              \n\\maketitle\n\nDamascene deposited Copper has been the Back End of Line (BEOL) interconnect conductor of choice for semiconductor technology nodes since 2000. Copper has several desirable features, including a low bulk resistivity ($\\approx$ 1.68 $\\mu \\Omega$ cm at room temperature, second only to Ag among elemental metals \\cite{giancoli2008physics}) and the ability to easily be electro-deposited and annealed at temperatures compatible with semiconductor processing. \nDamascene deposited Copper has been the Back End of Line (BEOL) interconnect conductor of choice for semiconductor technology nodes since 2000. Copper has several desirable features, including a low bulk resistivity ($\\approx$ 1.68 $\\mu \\Omega$ cm at room temperature, second only to Ag among elemental metals \\cite{giancoli2008physics}) and the ability to easily be electro-deposited and annealed at temperatures compatible with semiconductor processing. \n\nWith metal linewidth scaling proceeding in sync with technology scaling, it should be expected that the resistance per unit length (henceforth referred to as $R/l$ with units in $\\Omega/\\mu$m) of BEOL Cu metallization will increase. It has been known for some time, however, that metal resistivity also increases with a decrease in metal dimensionality \\cite{sondheimer1952mean}. This adds to the increase in $R/l$ that is expected from a simple reduction in dimensions. This increase in metal resistivity has been attributed to an increase in electron scattering due to grain boundaries \\cite{mayadas1970electrical}, surfaces and interfaces \\cite{fuchs1938conductivity}. Consequently, the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) has projected an increase in roadmap effective metal resistivity (for the lowest BEOL metallization level or M1) from 4.77 $\\mu \\Omega$-cm in 2016 to 11.41 $\\mu \\Omega$-cm by the year 2028 \\cite{wilson2013international}. This corresponds to a significant increase in projected $R/l$ requirement from approximately 35 $\\Omega/\\mu$m in the year 2016 to 1180 $\\Omega/\\mu$m in the year 2028.\n\nTo determine if Cu can meet this requirement, we use first principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) based electronic structure simulations of Cu to find the lower limits of its line resistance $R/l$ for metal linewidths corresponding to future technology nodes. These lower limits are then compared to ITRS projected requirements for the lowest Back End of Line metallization level (M1)\\cite{wilson2013international}. \n\nThe motivation for a lower limits investigation is that if the $R/l$ lower limits are sufficiently below projected requirements, then they can be achieved through continued improvements in BEOL resistance engineering. If the lower limits themselves are significantly above projected requirements, it serves to re-evaluate if Cu is suitable for future nodes. Our investigation is similar in spirit to previous calculations on the lower limits of contact resistivity in Si \\cite{maassen2013full, hegde2014effect}. \n\nWhile realistic DFT simulations of interconnect structures are often difficult to achieve due to cumbersome computational requirements of size (millions of atoms), structure (potentially infinite combinations of grain orientations) and time (DFT does not scale linearly with system size), DFT calculations of electronic structure are especially useful for the calculation of lower limits of electrical figures-of-merit for metals. DFT has been shown to accurately reproduce the bulk Fermi Surface and resistivity of metal nanostructures\\cite{feldman2010simulation, CuModel, CuConfinement, kim2010large, ke2009resistivity, timoshevskii2008influence, zhou2010ab}. DFT calculations of metal electronic structure also do not suffer from the 'band gap problem' that prevents an accurate determination of semiconductor electronic structure.\n\nWe wish to state explicitly what we mean by 'lower limits of line resistance' in this letter. In the absence of any electron scattering mechanism such as that due to phonons, impurities, interfaces and grain boundaries, conductance is decided simply by the number of conducting channels available. If we translate this definition for the case of Cu interconnects, we infer that the ballistic/Landauer limit of conductance ($G = \\frac{2e^2}{h}T$ where T is the Fermi-broadened number of conducting modes and $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$ is the quantum of conductance) of monocrystalline nanowires in the coherent transport regime represents the upper limit of Cu interconnect conductance and their corresponding resistance represents the lower limit \\cite{datta2005quantum}. While the resistance of monocrystalline nanowires represents the theoretical lower limit, they do not (yet) represent a practically achievable lower limit. The processes involved in the formation of Cu interconnects result in, at best, structures with a high concentration of low specific resistivity [111]/[111] $\\Sigma 3$ twin boundaries of Coincidence Site Lattice (CSL) type \\cite{lu2004ultrahigh}. A practically achievable lower limit would therefore consist of nanowires with such twin boundaries along the direction of transport.\n\nIn this letter we therefore report both theoretical and practical lower $R/l$ limits. The rest of this letter is organized as follows. We first report the ballistic conductance versus cross sectional area for monocrystalline nanowires oriented along 6 different transport directions. This is followed by a brief discussion on the physical reasons for the anisotropy in ballistic conductance of monocrystalline nanowires. Ballistic conductance information is then converted to $R/l$ versus cross sectional area within the Landauer-Buttiker formalism \\cite{datta2005quantum} and is compared to ITRS requirements. Next, the simplest grain boundary scattering mechanism - twin [111]/[111] $\\Sigma$3 boundaries are added to [111] oriented nanowires and their $R/l$ versus cross sectional area is compared to ITRS requirements. \n\nIn order to compute ballistic conductance, monocrystalline Cu nanowire structures oriented along six transport orientations - [100], [110], [111], [112], [120] and [122] - were first created. Since aspect ratio (AR) increase is usually used in the damascene process to lower Cu resistance, three nanowire cross sectional AR's - 1$\\times$1, 1$\\times$1.5 and 1$\\times$2 were investigated. The cross sectional areas of the structures ranged from 20 to 100 nm$^2$. The choice of orientations was motivated by the dominant orientations of grains seen in the direction of transport in damascene deposited Cu interconnects \\cite{ganesh2012effect}.\nFirst principles DFT calculations of the band structure of these nanowires was then carried out. Oriented Cu nanowires with cross sectional areas up to 100 nm$^2$ contain about 5 to 15000 atoms. Computing the self consistent band structure of such a large number of atoms in DFT is computationally cumbersome. To enable scaling of DFT calculations to the required system size, a recently published $ab$ $initio$ s-orbital approximation to the basis of Cu was used to compute the self consistent band structure of the nanowires \\cite{hegde2015feasibility}. For additional details of the computational procedure, we refer the interested reader to this work.\n\nHaving computed the band structure, simple mode counting was used to determine their ballistic conductance (upper limit of conductance) in the coherent transport regime. In order to compare the conductance of these nanowires with that of bulk Cu, the ballistic transmission in bulk Cu was averaged over its Fermi surface and plotted alongside nanowire transmission. This comparison is shown in figure \\ref{fig:G_v_A_limits}. The figure indicates that a severe reduction in ballistic conductance is observed across orientations when Cu is confined, in agreement with previous DFT and Tight Binding (TB) calculations on Cu nanowires \\cite{fonseca2013efficient, CuModel, jones2015electron}. It can also be seen that an anisotropy exists in the extent to which quantum confinement affects ballistic conductance of individual orientations. To a good approximation, the effect of quantum confinement on ballistic conductance can also be seen to be independent of AR variation.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=7in, height=3.5in]{G_v_A_limits.eps}\n\t\\caption{Ballistic conductance of Cu nanowires versus orientation and cross sectional area for three aspect ratios.}\n\t\\label{fig:G_v_A_limits}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo determine the physical reason for the quantum confinement-induced anisotropy in ballistic conductance for a prototypical metal such as Cu that has an approximately spherical bulk Fermi surface, we examined the planar averaged electrostatic potential in the nanowires along the direction of confinement. We then contrasted this for nanowires oriented along different transport directions but having the same cross sectional area in order to ensure a fair comparison. An example of this comparison is seen in figure \\ref{fig:Potential_Profiles}. It is evident that the confining potential varies quite strongly for the nanowires oriented differently. This anisotropy in quantum confinement potential leads to an anisotropy in modes available for conduction under confinement and consequently to the anisotropy in ballistic conductance.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{Potential_profiles.eps}\n\t\\caption{Planar averaged electrostatic potential profile for nanowires having a cross sectional area of 1 nm$^2$ oriented along [100], [110] and [111]. A and B represent the orthogonal directions of confinement and are mutually orthogonal to the direction of transport indicated in the figure legend}\n\t\\label{fig:Potential_Profiles}\n\\end{figure}  \n\nBallistic conductance is independent of the length of the cross section in the transport direction. While it does provide insights into electronic transport, ballistic conductance is not a commonly used and measured metric. A more commonly used metric for BEOL purposes is the line resistance $R/l$ of the interconnect. To introduce a length scale corresponding to a scattering event we assume a scattering length equal to bulk inelastic mean free path in Cu - 400\\AA. It has been shown \\cite{datta2005quantum} that an introduction of a scattering mean free path in the Landauer formalism modifies the ballistic conductance to\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nG = \\frac{2e^2}{h}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+l}T\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"G=\\frac{2e^{2}}{h}\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda+l}T\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mi>h</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mi>\u03bb</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06675.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nUsing the bulk mean free path is a rather generous assumption, given that the width of the nanowires investigated is a maximum of 10 nm. It is thus safe to say that the $R/l$ numbers for monocrystalline Cu nanowires represent the lower limit of line resistance in Cu interconnects.\n \nTo facilitate comparison with simulation data, we use projected Cu requirements for resistivity data available in the 2013 ITRS table (see MPU Interconnect Technology requirements for M1 level in the roadmap \\cite{wilson2013international}) and calculate projected $R/l$ requirements for cross sectional areas between 20 to 100 nm$^2$. We subtracted the barrier/cladding thickness from the trench bottom and from each sidewall to obtain the effective Cu cross sectional area $A$. The $R/l$ was then computed by dividing the conductor effective resistivity $\\rho$ (obtained from aforementioned table) by $A$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=7in, height=3.5in]{R_lower_limits_paper_modified.eps}\n\t\\caption{Comparison of $R/l$ lower limits for different Cu orientations with ITRS requirements. Bulk $R/l$ computed with the Fermi surface averaged transmission is also shown for reference.}\n\t\\label{fig:R_lower_limits_paper}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:R_lower_limits_paper} shows a comparison of $R/l$ lower limits for different Cu orientations obtained from DFT and $R/l$ ITRS projected requirements for Cu cross sectional areas (i.e. without liner and barrier) between 20 and 100 nm$^2$. For the sake of reference, the bulk $R/l$ lower limit (obtained from the Fermi Averaged bulk ballistic transmission) is also plotted. The anisotropy evident in the ballistic conductance plot in figure \\ref{fig:G_v_A_limits} translates to an equivalent anisotropy in $R/l$ limits versus transport orientations. It is evident that the lowest $R/l$ limit in Cu is determined by [110] oriented monocrystalline nanowires. It can also be seen that this lowest $R/l$ limit in Cu [110] is well below ITRS projected requirements for all cross sectional areas shown.\n\nAs mentioned previously, while the calculation of $R/l$ for monocrystalline nanowires may indicate a theoretical limit that is lower than ITRS projected requirements, we are unaware of a practical method to pattern perfectly monocrystalline metal interconnects on a large scale required for semiconductor technology. Existing techniques such as electrodeposition used in the damascene process result in interconnects that are polycrystalline with a wide variation in the grain orientation distribution \\cite{ganesh2012effect}. It has, however, been demonstrated that Cu nanowires with a high degree of 'twinning' along the [111] transport direction can be fabricated \\cite{lu2004ultrahigh}. Recent DFT calculations of the specific resistivity of grain boundaries also indicate that the [111]/[111] $\\Sigma$3 Coincidence Site Lattice (CSL) or twin boundary has the least specific resistivity among all grain boundaries \\cite{cesar2014calculated}. This has been attributed to negligible bond-orientational disorder seen at such boundaries compared to other grain boundaries. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the $R/l$ values of nanowires with [111]/[111] $\\Sigma$3 twin boundaries along transport direction represent a more practically achievable lower limit.\n\nThe calculations performed on monocrystalline nanowires were therefore repeated for nanowires consisting of [111]/[111] twin boundaries along the direction of transport. Since a significant impact of AR was not seen for monocrystalline nanowires, we limited the calculations to an AR of 1$\\times$1. Figure \\ref{fig:R_111_lower_limits_and_structure_paper} shows an example of such a structure. In keeping with data from recent experiments and other simulation studies of the Cu interconnect system \\cite{roberts2015resistivity, pyzyna2015resistivity}, linewidth was assumed to equal grain size. As shown in figure \\ref{fig:R_111_lower_limits_and_structure_paper}, the eventual structure simulated consists of 1nm twin grains infinitely repeated along the direction of transport. $R/l$ values for cross sectional areas up to 60 nm$^2$ (system size of up to 25000 atoms) were fit and projected up to cross sectional areas of 100 nm$^2$. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth,height=3in]{R_111_lower_limits_and_structure_paper_modified.eps}\n\t\\caption{(left) Example of a relaxed [111]/[111] twin boundary structure having aspect ratio of 1$\\times$1 and grain size equal to linewidth (right) $R/l$ values for [111]/[111] twin boundary nanowires compared with ITRS projected requirements and bulk lower limit.}\n\t\\label{fig:R_111_lower_limits_and_structure_paper}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:R_111_lower_limits_and_structure_paper} also shows the comparison of $R/l$ values for such structures and ITRS requirements. It is very clear that a change from [111] oriented monocrystalline to the simplest boundary - [111]/[111] twin structures results in an increase in $R/l$ values to the extent that these are now higher than projected ITRS requirements. This is even after discounting the fact that we used the bulk scattering mean free path for the twin boundary structures even though the grain size was significantly smaller than the mean free path used.\n\nIt must be emphasized that the twin boundary structures considered in this study are rather idealistic and highly ordered. Process related nonidealities such as grain orientation anisotropy (GOA), line edge roughness, and the presence of a Cu-liner interface will result in actual $R/l$ values that are higher than this ideal case. GOA, especially, will result in a significant resistance penalty owing to increased anisotropy in conductance for different orientations when Cu is quantum confined as discussed previously. It is conceivable that a reduction in GOA affected by an increase in grain size through process improvements will decrease $R/l$ values. Cu interconnects, however, require the use of a diffusion barrier and a liner, and it is unclear how these sources of scattering can be eliminated. \n\nIn conclusion, we reported the results of our investigation into the lower limits of line resistance in Cu interconnects. We found that simple confinement results in a significant reduction in Cu's bulk current carrying capacity. Contrary to what the nearly spherical bulk Fermi surface of Cu leads us to expect, we also found that this confinement effect is sensitive to the confinement and transport orientation. When the simplest grain boundary scattering mechanism - scattering at highly ordered [111]/[111] $\\Sigma$3 twin boundaries - was introduced into otherwise ballistic monocrystalline [111] interconnects, we found that the $R/l$ limits increase beyond ITRS projected requirements. Scattering due to grain boundaries and other imperfections such as interfaces and line edge roughness will further add to these $R/l$ lower limits due to quantum confinement. The resultant increase in BEOL resistance may present a significant obstacle to the continued use of Cu interconnects in future technology nodes. We believe that the results of this investigation warrant increased attention on schemes that mitigate the potentially rapid rise in BEOL resistance in future technology nodes.    \n\nWe thank Titash
