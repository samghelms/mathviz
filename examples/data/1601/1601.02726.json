Each block-diagonal subsector has a definite eigen\nvalue of $J_z$,\nand thus no mixing is allowed between different subsectors.\nFurthermore, \nusing the other commutation relations, $[J_{x,y}, {\\cal H}({\\bm k})]=0$,\none also finds that the $J_z=-1$ subsector are essentially the same as the\n$J_z=1$ subsector. Therefore, it is enough to consider only the $J_z=1$\nsector.\nActually, the BdG Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:BdG_matrix}) is rewritten in\nterms of the following reduced Hamiltonian in the $J_z=1$ sector,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\sum_{{\\bm k}} \\psi^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})h({\\bm k})\\psi({\\bm k}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nh({\\bm k})\n=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\epsilon({\\bm k}) & \\psi({\\bm k})\\\\\n\\psi({\\bm k}) & -\\epsilon^{t}({\\bm k})\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\quad \n\\psi({\\bm k})\n=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\\\\nc_{\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})\n\\end{array}\n\\right), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\epsilon({\\bm k})$ and $\\psi({\\bm k})$ are defined as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal E}({\\bm k})=\\epsilon({\\bm k})s_0,\n\\quad \n\\epsilon^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})=\\epsilon({\\bm k}),\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\Delta({\\bm k})=i\\psi({\\bm k})s_y,\n\\quad\n\\psi^t({\\bm k})=\\psi(-{\\bm k}).\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\nWe should note here that the reduced Hamiltonian $h({\\bm k})$ does not\nhave the original\nparticle-hole symmetry: Because of the\nanticommutation relation\n$\\{{\\cal C}, J_i\\}=0$, the particle-hole symmetry maps a state $|u({\\bm\nk})\\rangle$ with $J_z=1$ to ${\\cal C}|u({\\bm k})\\rangle$ with a\ndifferent eigenvalue, i.e. $J_z=-1$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nJ_z {\\cal C}|u({\\bm k})\\rangle=-{\\cal C}J_z|u({\\bm\n k})\\rangle=-{\\cal C}|u({\\bm k})\\rangle.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSo the $J_z=1$ sector cannot keep the original particle-hole symmetry. \n \n\nAlthough $h({\\bm k})$ cannot retain the original particle-hole\nsymmetry, it has a its own alternative one:\n\n\nBecause of the commutation relation $[J_x{\\cal C}, J_z]=0$,\nthe combination of $J_x$ and ${\\cal C}$\nmaps the $J_z=1$ sector to itself, which defines the ``spin-rotaion\nparticle-hole symmetry'' ${\\cal C}_J\\equiv J_x{\\cal C}$ in the $J_z=1$ sector. \n(One can also consider $J_y{\\cal C}$ as a combined particle-hole\nsymmetry, but it eventually defines the same symmetry as $J_x{\\cal C}$\nin the $J_z=1$ sector).\nIn terms of the reduced Hamiltonian $h({\\bm k})$, the spin-rotation\nparticle-hole symmetry is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal C}_J h({\\bm k}){\\cal C}_J^{-1}=-h(-{\\bm k}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\cal C}_J=i\\tau_y K$.\nWhile the original particle-hole symmetry that obeys\n${\\cal C}^2=1$, the spin-rotation particle-hole symmetry satisfies\n${\\cal C}_J^2=(J_x{\\cal C})^2=-1$.\nIn the Altland-Zirnbauer scheme, systems having such particle-hole\nsymmetry is called as class C.\n\nIf ${\\cal H}({\\bm k})$ is time-reversal invariant, so is the reduced\nHamiltonian $h({\\bm k})$, but in a manner similar to the particle-hole\nsymmetry, its\ntime-reversal transformation is\ndifferent from the original one:\nSince the original time-reversal transformation flips the spin of\nelectrons,  $h({\\bm k})$ defined in the $J_z=1$ sector does\nnot keep the original time-reversal symmetry. \n\nInstead, \nthe $J_z=1$\nsector has the ``spin-rotation time-reversal symmetry'' ${\\cal T}_J\\equiv\nJ_x{\\cal T}$ as a combination of $J_x$ and ${\\cal T}$. \nCorrespondingly, $h({\\bm k})$ satisfies\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal T}_J h({\\bm k}) {\\cal T}_J^{-1}=h(-{\\bm k}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\cal T}_J=K$. \nDifferent from the original time-reversal symmetry\n${\\cal T}$, which satisfies ${\\cal T}^2=-1$, the spin-rotation\ntime-reversal symmetry ${\\cal T}_J$ obeys ${\\cal T}_J^2=1$.\nSystems with ${\\cal C}_J$ and ${\\cal T}_J$ are called as class CI.\n\nTopological numbers for class C and class CI systems are summarized in\nTable \\ref{table:Periodic}. Note that only even numbers are possible in\nthe topological numbers.\nFrom the bulk-boundary correspondence, \nthis means that only even numbers of surface gapless states are possible\nin these classes of topological superconductors.\nTherefore, to realize locally unpaired Majorana fermions in topological\nsuperconductors, we need the strong spin-orbit interaction or\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs which break the SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry.\n\n\\subsection{Spinless superconductors}\n\\label{subsec:spinless}\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry must be\nbroken in order to realize locally unpaired Majorana fermions.\nA simple system with broken SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry is\nfully spin-polarized electrons.    \nFully spin-polarized electrons can be regarded as spinless\nelectrons since the spin degrees of freedom are completely locked in a\nparticular direction.  \nSuperconducting states of fully spin-polarized electrons are called\nas spinless superconductors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping only up-spin electrons and up-spin holes in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdG_matrix}), one can obtain\nthe BdG Hamiltonian for spinless superconductors,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{\\bm k}}\n\\psi_{\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\psi_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}),\n\\quad\n\\psi_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\\\\nc_{\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})\n\\end{array}\n\\right) \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nh_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n{\\cal E}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k}) & \\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\\\\n\\Delta^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k}) &-{\\cal\n E}^t_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k})   \n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere ${\\cal E}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})={\\cal E}^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\n$, and $\\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}^t({\\bm\nk})=-\\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k})$.\nAs well as the original BdG Hamiltonian, the spinless BdG Hamiltonian\n$h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})$ has the particle-hole symmetry,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal C}h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}){\\cal C}^{-1}=-h_{\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k}), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nand thus it is classified as class D.\n\nSpinless superconductors cannot be invariant under ${\\cal T}$\nsince the ordinary time-reversal operation flips the spin of electrons, \nNevertheless, they may be invariant under a combination of the spin-flip\nand the time-reversal, which we denote ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}$\nIn term of the spinless BdG Hamiltonian, the\ncombined time-reversal symmetry reads\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal T}_{\\rm s} h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}){\\cal T}_{\\rm s}^{-1}=h_{\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k}), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}=K$. ${\\cal E}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})$ and\n$\\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})$ should be real in order to have the ${\\cal\nT}_{\\rm s}$-invariance.\nThe time-reversal invariant spinless superconductors are characterized\nby ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}$ and ${\\cal C}$ obeying ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}^2=1$ and ${\\cal\nC}^2=1$, being classified as class BDI in the Altland-Zirnbauer\nclassification.  \nClass BDI can be topologically non-trivial in one-dimension, but cannot\nin two and three-dimensions. \nLike class DIII, class BDI has the chiral symmetry as a combination of\n${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}$ and ${\\cal C}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Gamma_{\\rm s} h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\Gamma_{\\rm\n s}^{-1}=-h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}),\n\\quad \n\\Gamma_{\\rm s}={\\cal T}_{\\rm s}{\\cal C}. \n\\end{eqnarray} \nThe one-dimensional topological number in class BDI is given\nby\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nw^{\\rm BDI}_{\\rm 1D}=\\frac{i}{4\\pi} \\int_{\\rm BZ}dk{\\rm tr}\\left[\\Gamma_{\\rm s}\nh_{\\uparrow}^{-1}\\partial_k h_{\\uparrow}\\right].\n\\label{eq:1dW}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\subsection{Topological defect}\n\\label{subsec:topodefect}\n\nIn the presence of a defect like a vortex, the BdG Hamiltonian depends\non the distance ${\\bm R}$ from the defect, ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$,\nas well as the momentum ${\\bm k}$.\nConsidering topology of ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$ away from the\ndefect, we can examine the topological stability of the defect and\ngapless defect modes at the same time.\\cite{teo-kane2} \n\nFor this purpose, consider a $D$-dimensional sphere $S^D$ \nsurrounding the defect in $d$-dimensions. \nFor instance, consider $D=1$ ($D=2$) dimensional sphere $S^1$ $(S^2)$ for a line\n(point) defect in $d=3$ dimensions.\nThe BdG Hamiltonina ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$ is now defined on the\nbase space $({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})\\in T^d\\times S^D$ with the\n$d$-dimensional Brillouine zone $T^d$.\nAway from the defect, the system is gapped, so in a manner similar to\nuniform superconductors, one can define various nontrivial topological\nnumbers for ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$.\n\nAmong the topological numbers for ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$, some do\nnot change their value even when one neglects either the\n${\\bm k}$-dependence  or ${\\bm R}$-dependence of ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$. \nThe former ${\\bm k}$-independent topological numbers are topological\nnumbers of the defect itself, which ensures the stability of the defect,\nwhile the latter ${\\bm R}$-independent ones are nothing\nbut the bulk topological numbers without the defect. \nFrom the rest topological numbers, we can predict the existence of gapless modes\nlocalized on the defect.\n\nFor instance, away from the core, a vortex in a two dimensional\nsuperconductor is well-described by the following BdG Hamiltonian,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n{\\cal E}({\\bm k}) \n& \\Delta({\\bm k})e^{i\\theta}\\\\\n\\Delta^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})e^{-i\\theta} \n& -{\\cal E}^{-t}(-{\\bm k})  \n\\end{array}\n\\right) \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\bm k}=(k_x, k_y)$ and ${\\bm R}=(R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta)$.\nHere $\\theta$ is the angle around the vortex.\nThe vortex can host a Majorana zero mode localized on the core, which\nexistence is ensured by the topological invariant\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nu=\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2}\\int_{T^2\\times S^1}\\epsilon^{ijk}{\\rm tr}\n\\left[{\\cal A}_i\\partial_j{\\cal A}_k+i\\frac{2}{3}{\\cal A}_i{\\cal\n A}_j{\\cal A}_k\\right]\n\\quad {\\rm mod.} 2,  \n\\label{eq:CS}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the gauge field matrix $({\\cal A}_i)_{mn}({\\bm k}, \\theta)$ is defined as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n({\\cal A}_i)_{mn}({\\bm k},\\theta)=-i\\langle u_m({\\bm k},\n \\theta)|\\partial_i u_n({\\bm k},\\theta)\\rangle, \n\\quad \n(i=k_x, k_y, \\theta), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith negative energy states $|u_n({\\bm k},\\theta)\\rangle$ of ${\\cal H}({\\bm\nk},\\theta)$. \nHere the trace in Eq.(\\ref{eq:CS}) is taken for all the negative energy states.\n\nA systematic classification of topological defects and their gapless\nmodes has been performed based on the K-theory. \n\n\\subsection{Topological crystalline superconductor}\n\\label{subsec:TCS}\n\nIn addition to the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries,\nsuperconductors may have crystal symmetries.\nSuch material dependent symmetries also influence on their topological\nproperties.\\cite{mizushima-sato,teo,ueno,chui,zhang1,fang,liu-law,benalcazar,mizushima-sato1,morimoto}\n\nFor instance, consider the mirror reflection symmetry\nwith respect to the $xy$-plane,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal M}_{xy}{\\cal H}({\\bm k}){\\cal M}^{-1}_{xy}={\\cal H}(k_x, k_y, -k_z), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere ${\\cal M}_{xy}$ is the mirror reflection operator. \nSince the BdG Hamiltonian ${\\cal\nH}(k_x, k_y, 0)$ on the mirror invariant plane at $k_z=0$ commutes with ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$, ${\\cal\nH}(k_x, k_y, 0)$ is block diagonal in the diagonal basis of ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$. \nFor each block-diagonal subsector with a definite eigenvalue of\n${\\cal M}_{xy}$, the mirror Chern number can be introduced as a Chern number\nof the subsector. \nWhen the mirror Chern number is nonzero, gapless states appears on\nsurfaces preserving the mirror reflection symmetry. \nThe gapless states are stable as far as the mirror symmetry is retained.\n\nWhereas a similar mirror-protected topological surface state exists in\ninsulators,\\cite{CTI-fu, CTI-ex1, CTI-ex2, CTI-ex3}  superconductors have their own novel properties.\\cite{ueno} \nIn superconductors, two different mirror reflection symmetries\nare possible for the same crystal structure:\nA superconducting state keeps the mirror reflection symmetry of the\nnormal state when the gap function is invariant under the mirror reflection,\nbut this is not only possibility.\nEven when the gap function changes it sign under the mirror reflection, \nthe superconducting state may support a mirror reflection symmetry as a\ncombination of the original mirror reflection and a U(1) gauge rotation\nfor the gap function. \nFor the former (latter), mirror-even (mirror-odd) gap function, ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$ is given by ${\\cal M}_{xy}^{+}=is_z\\tau_z$ (${\\cal\nM}^-_{xy}=is_z\\tau_0$). \n\n\n\n\nThe two different mirror reflection\nsymmetries realize different mirror-protected surface state:\nFor the mirror-even case, the mirror reflection operator ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}^+$ commutes with the charge conjugation operator ${\\cal\nC}$. Thus by applying ${\\cal C}$ on an eigenstate $|\\lambda\\rangle$ with the\neigenvalue $\\lambda=\\pm i$ of ${\\cal M}_{xy}^+$, we have an eigenstate\nwith an opposite eigenvalue $-\\lambda$. (Note that ${\\cal C}$ is anti-unitary.)\nTherefore, the particle-hole symmetry merely interchanges the two mirror\nsubsectors, so each mirror subsector does not have its own\nparticle-hole symmetry. \nAs a result, a surface state in each mirror subsector is not\nself-conjugate, and thus it is a Dirac fermion. \nOn the other hand, for the mirror-odd case, ${\\cal M}_{xy}^-$\nanticommutes with ${\\cal C}$. In this case, the charge conjugation operator\n${\\cal C}$ maps a mirror eigensector into itself, so each mirror\nsubsector has its own particle-hole symmetry. \nTherefore, a surface state or a vortex state in each mirror subsector can be\na self-conjugate Majorana fermion.\nThe non-Abelian statistics of the mirror protected Majorana fermions\nis discussed in Ref.\\citen{sato-yamakage-mizushima} \n\nCrystal symmetries other than mirror reflection symmetry also\nprotect topological states.\n\nA complete classification of topological crystalline\ninsulators/superconductors and topological defects protected by\norder-two space group symmetries is given in\nRefs.\\citeonline{shiozaki-sato,shiozaki-sato-gomi}. \n\n\\subsection{Majorana Ising property}\n\\label{subsec:Ising}\n\nCrystals may have an anti-unitary symmetry ${\\cal T}_G$ as a combination of\ntime-reversal ${\\cal T}$ and a crystal symmetry $G$. \nSuch an anti-unitary symmetry, which is called magnetic symmetry, can\nsurvive even when both ${\\cal T}$ and ${\\cal G}$ are broken.\nFor example, the magnetic mirror reflection symmetry with respect to the\n$xy$-plane is obtained by combining the mirror reflection ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$ with the time-reversal ${\\cal T}=is_y K$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}{\\cal H}({\\bm k}){\\cal\n T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}^{-1} \n={\\cal H}(-k_x, -k_y, k_z),\n\\end{eqnarray} \nwith ${\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}={\\cal T}{\\cal M}_{xy}$.\nWhen we apply a magnetic field normal to the $z$-direction, both of the mirror\nreflection and time-reversal symmetries are explicitly broken, but the magnetic\nmirror reflection symmetry ${\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}$ remains.\nAs is shown below, \nthe magnetic symmetry also stabilizes topological\nphases,\\cite{sato-fujimoto1, mizushima-sato, mizushima-sato1, fang} in which \nMajorana fermions show a unique anisotropic response to magnetic\nfields.\\cite{sato-fujimoto1, chung1, higashitani, shindou, mizushima-sato}\n\nFirst, we note that \nthe magnetic symmetry\n${\\cal T}_G$ results in\na chiral crystal symmetry $\\Gamma_G$,\nby combining it with the particle-hole symmetry.\nThen, along a one-dimensional line in the momentum subspace invariant under $G$,\nwe can define a one-dimensional winding number in a similar manner as\nEq.(\\ref{eq:windingnumber_1D}).\nAs a result, we may have gapless state ensured by the one-dimensional\nwinding number:\nFor the magnetic mirror reflection symmetry ${\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}$, we\nhave the chiral mirror symmetry, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}} {\\cal H}({\\bm k})\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}^{-1}\n=-{\\cal H}(k_x, k_y, -k_z),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}=e^{i\\alpha}{\\cal C}{\\cal T}{\\cal M}_{xy}$\n(Here the phase $\\alpha$ is determined so as $\\Gamma_{{\\cal\nM}_{xy}}^2=1$.)\nThen, say, for a line with a fixed $k_x$ in the mirror invariant plane at\n$k_z=0$, we can define the topological invariant \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nw_{\\rm 1D}(k_x)=\\frac{i}{4\\pi}\\oint d k_y \n{\\rm tr}\\left[\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}{\\cal H}^{-1}(k_x, k_y, 0)\n\\partial_{k_y} {\\cal\n\t H}(k_x, k_y, 0)\\right]. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nWhen $w_{\\rm 1D}(k_x)\\neq 0$, from the bulk-boundary correspondence,\nthere exist $|w_{\\rm 1D}(k_x)|$ zero modes on a surface normal to the $y$-axis.\n\n\nOne can show that the zero modes $|u_0\\rangle$ protected by the magnetic\nsymmetry ${\\cal T}_{G}$ are eigenstates of the chiral crystal operator\n$\\Gamma_{G}$.\nAt the same time, from the particle-hole symmetry, \n$|u_0\\rangle$ satisfies\n${\\cal C}|u_0\\rangle=|u_0\\rangle$ by choosing its phase properly.\nThe latter condition implies that the zero modes are self-conjugate\nMajorana fermions, and the former one determines the spin and/or orbital\nstructure of the Majorana zero mode. \nIn particular, for spinful systems with the magnetic mirror reflection\nor the magnetic $C_2$ rotation, \nfrom these two conditions, one can show that the density operator of the\nMajorana zero modes is identically zero, and the spin density operator of the\nMajorana zero modes is nonzero only in a particular\ndirection.\\cite{mizushima-sato, shiozaki-sato} \nTherefore, the Majorana zero modes can couple to a magnetic field only in a\nparticular direction, resulting in an anisotropic magnetic\nresponse.\n\n\\section{Realization of topological superconductors supporting Majorana fermions}\n\\label{sec:realization}\n\nIn this section,we explain basic properties of topological superconductors, \nparticularly, focusing on class D systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, for which typical features\nsuch as the existence of Majorana fermions are demonstrated.\nWe also discuss how the class D topological superconductors can be realized in real systems.\n\n\\subsection{Chiral $p$-wave superconductor}\n\\label{subsec:chiralp}\n\nA prototype of topological superconductors supporting Majorana fermions is a\nspinless chiral $p$-wave superconductor in two dimensions.\\cite{read-green} \nThe Bogoliubov de Genne (BdG) Hamiltonian is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\sum_{\\bm k}\n(c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bm k}}, c_{-{\\bm k}})\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{\\bm k}\\\\\nc^{\\dagger}_{-{\\bm

& -\\frac{k_x^2+k_y^2}{2m}+\\mu_0\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\label{eq:BdGchiralp}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nNow, following the original argument by Read and Green,\\cite{read-green} we consider the case\nof small $\\mu_0$.\nUnder this assumption, the Fermi momentum becomes small so we can\nneglect the ${\\bm k}^2$ term in the Hamiltonian.\nEquation (\\ref{eq:BdGchiralp}) reduces to \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})\\rightarrow\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\mu_0 & \\Delta_0(k_x+ik_y)\\\\\n\\Delta_0^*(k_x-ik_y) & \\mu_0\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\label{eq:BdGchiralp2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nUsing this simplified Hamiltonian, we first examine the edge state.\nFor this purpose, \nconsider a two dimensional semi-infinite system which extends to the\npositive $x$ direction, with the boundary at $x=0$.\nTo realize such a system \nwe replace $k_i$ and $\\mu_0$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdGchiralp2}) as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nk_i\\rightarrow -i\\partial_i,\n\\quad\n\\mu_0\\rightarrow \\mu(x), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mu(x)=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n-\\mu_0 <0,&\\mbox{for

semi-infinite system with $x>0$. \nThe edge state is examined by solving the BdG equation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\mu(x) &

(\\ref{eq:Majoranacond}) and (\\ref{eq:Majoranaanticommu}) show that $\\gamma$ is a Majorana\nzero mode. \n\nIn a similar manner, one can show that $N$ well-separated vortices\nsupport $N$ Majorana zero modes satisfying\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i^2=1,\n\\quad\n\\gamma_i\\gamma_j=-\\gamma_j\\gamma_i,  \n\\end{eqnarray} \nfor $i\\neq j$.\nLater, we will argue that this relation is an important ingredient to\nrealize the non-Abelian statistics \n\n\\subsection{Dirac systems}\n\nMajorana zero modes and thus non-Abelian statistics can be realized\neven in an $s$-wave superconducting state. \nThis possibility was first pointed out in 2003.\\cite{sato} \nHere we will review the idea of this paper.\n\nThe basic idea is to consider a two-dimensional bulk Dirac fermion\nsystem instead of an ordinary electron one. \nAs was discussed in Sec.\\ref{subsec:Majorana}, quasiparticles in superconducting states\nmay satisfy the Majorana condition.\nThus, if we consider bulk Dirac fermions, they automatically realize\nMajorana fermions even in an $s$-wave superconducting state.    \nIn the Nambu representation with the basis $\\Psi'({\\bm x})=(c^{\\uparrow}({\\bm x}),\nc_{\\downarrow}({\\bm x}), c^{\\dagger}_{\\downarrow}({\\bm x}),\n-c^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow}({\\bm x}))$, the BdG Hamiltonian of the Majorana\nfermions is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-i\\sigma_i\\partial_i & \\Phi^*\\\\\n\\Phi & i\\sigma_i\\partial_i\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:BdGDirac} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\sigma_{i=x,y}$ is the Pauli matrices, and $\\Phi$ is an $s$-wave\ngap function.\nNote that the diagonal term is not the Hamiltonian for ordinary electrons \nbut that for Dirac fermions.\n\nNow we will show that there exists a Majorana zero mode in a vortex of\nthis system. \nWhen the system support a vortex, $\\Phi$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdGDirac}) becomes\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Phi=\\Phi(r)e^{i\\theta},\n\\quad\n\\Phi(\\infty)=\\Phi_0, \n\\end{eqnarray} \nwhere $r$ is the distance from the vortex, and $\\theta$ is the angle\naround the vortex.\nThe BdG Hamiltonian for the zero mode\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-i\\sigma_i\\partial_i & \\Phi(r)^{-i\\theta}\\\\\n\\Phi(r)e^{i\\theta} & i\\sigma_i\\partial_i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n{\\bm u} \\\\\n{\\bm v}\n\\end{array}\n\\right) =0 \n\\end{eqnarray}\nis easily solved and the solution is\\cite{jackiw-rossi,callan-harvey} \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\bm u}\n=N\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\ni^{1/2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\exp\\left[-\\int_0^r dr'\\Phi(r')\n\\right],\n\\quad \n{\\bm v}=i\\sigma_y{\\bm u}^{*}. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe quantum operator $\\gamma$ for this solution in the mode expansion\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Psi'({\\bm x})=\\sqrt{2}\\gamma \n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n{\\bm u} \\\\\n{\\bm v}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)+\\cdots \n\\end{eqnarray}\ndefines the Majorana operator with $\\gamma^{\\dagger}=\\gamma$ and\n$\\gamma^2=1$.\nAs a result, vortices in this system obey the non-Abelian anyon statistics.\n\nA challenge of this idea is how to realize\nDirac fermions in condensed matter systems:\n\n\nIn general, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem tells us that such a single species\nof 2D Dirac fermions is impossible to exist in bulk periodic systems\nlike solid states.\\cite{nielsen-ninomiya}\nIndeed, no condensed matter realization of a single Dirac fermion had\nbeen known in 2003.\nTo avoid this difficulty, an application to high energy physics was\ndiscussed in Ref.\\citen{sato}.\nIn 2007, however, it was discovered that such a 2D Dirac fermion may exist\nas a surface state of topological insulators.\nBecause the surface state is not a real 2D state but spreads to\nthe bulk as well, it can be escaped \nfrom the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. \nThus, if one puts an $s$-wave superconductor on the top of\na topological insulator, one can realize the Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:BdGDirac}), as Fu and Kane discussed in Ref.\\citen{fu-kane}. \nIn the interface between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological insulator, the chemical potential is not zero, and thus the BdG\nHamiltonian is slightly modified as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-i\\sigma_i\\partial_i-\\mu & \\Phi^* \\\\\n\\Phi & i\\sigma_i\\partial_i+\\mu\n\\end{array}\n\\right). \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe chemical potential, however, does not affect on the existence of\nthe Majorana zero mode.  \nThe zero mode in the presence of the chemical potential is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\bm u}&=&N i^{3/2}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\ne^{-i\\theta} J_1(\\mu r)\\\\\ni^{-1}J_0(\\mu r)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\exp\\left[-\\int_0^r dr'\\Phi(r')\\right],\n\\nonumber\\\\\n{\\bm v}&=&i\\sigma_y {\\bm

unusual systems like\nchiral $p$-wave superconductors or superconducting Dirac fermions are\nneeded to realize non-Abelian anyons.\nIf we take into account the spin-orbit interaction, however, we may

physics has a long history.\nIt plays an important role in the classification of topological defects in condensed matter systems, such as vortices, dislocations, and disclinations etc., i.e.\nnon-trivial textures in real space configurations.\nIn 1982, a milestone was achieved by Thouless, Kohmoto, den Nijs and\nNightingale, who found an intimate relation between topological invariants and the Hall conductivity  \nin the quantum Hall effect.\\cite{thouless, kohmoto}\nThis is the first example of topological non-triviality realized in bulk quantum solid state systems, which is the origin of the notion of topological phases.\nIn contrast to topological textures in real space mentioned above, topological phases\nare characterized by non-triviality in the Hilbert space of quantum states.\nIn the last decade, remarkable advances have been achieved in this direction.\n\nSucceeding pioneering works by Haldane\\cite{haldane} and Volovik\\cite{volovik}, Kane-Mele's celebrated papers stimulated exploration of topological phases\nin band insulators.\\cite{kane-mele1,kane-mele2}\nSince then, \nthe notion of topological phases was extended to various other systems,\nincluding superconductors, superfluids, magnets, and correlated electron\nsystems.\\cite{hasan-kane,zhang, tanaka-review}\n\nFor topological superconductors, a nontrivial structure arises from phase winding of superconducting order parameters\nin momentum space. This can be regarded as a natural extension of a vortex of the superconducting order \nto momentum space.\nOne of the most important consequence of such topologically nontrivial structures in superconductors is the existence of Majorana fermions, which are \nzero-energy Bogoliubov quasiparticles.\\cite{read-green,beenakker-review,alicea-review,review-flensberg}\n\nBecause of particle-hole symmetry of superconducting states, a zero-energy single-particle state must be the equal-weight superposition of \nan electron and a hole. This implies that the hermit conjugate of this state is the same as its own; i.e. a particle is identical to an anti-particle,\nwhich is a signature of a Majorana fermion.\nIn topological superconductors, the Majorana zero-energy state realizes as an Andreev bound state at the surface of samples\nand in vortex cores. An important point here is that the Majorana zero-energy state is protected by the bulk topological non-triviality \nof the Hilbert space (the momentum space), and is not affected by extrinsic factors such as conditions of surfaces, impurities, and crystal imperfection.\nThis is in contrast to Andreev zero-energy bound state realized at the surface of d-wave superconductors, which is sensitive to the direction of the surface.\n\n\n\nMajorana fermions in topological superconductors give rise to various exotic phenomena.\nIn this review, we pick up several representative ones: (i) non-Abelian statistics, (ii) $4\\pi$-Josephson effect, (iii) non-local correlation, and (iv) thermal responses. \nThe non-Abelian statistics is novel quantum statistics remarkably distinct from Fermi and Bose statistics.\\cite{moore-read,nayak-wilczek,ivanov,stone-chung}\nThus, Majorana fermions in this context are not usual fermions.\nAlso, it is different from Abelian anyons in the fractional quantum Hall effect, which are characterized by\nfractional charge.\nThe most important feature of the non-Abelian statistics is that exchange operations of particles\nare not commutative, and the state depends on order of the exchange operations.\nThis peculiar property stems from topological degeneracy associated with Majorana fermions. \nIt has been proposed that particles obeying the non-Abelian statistics can be utilized for realization of fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation, which is dramatically robust against decoherence from environment. This scheme is called topological quantum computation.\\cite{TQC-rev} \nBecause of the possible technological application in the future as well as its importance of\nthe fundamental concept,\nthe non-Abelian statistics is one of the most intriguing features of Majorana fermions. However, its experimental realization and detection are still the most important open issue. \n\nMajorana fermions in topological superconductors behaves as if they emerge from splitting of electrons into two parts.\\cite{semenoff}\nIn fact, in the second quantized language, an electron field is complex, while a Majorana field is real, and two Majorana\nreal field can be combined into a complex fermion field for an electron (or a hole).\nThus, the emergence of Majorana fermions in topological superconductors can be regarded as \"fractionalization\" of electrons.\nActually, the fractionalized character of Majorana fermions appears as the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect.\\cite{kitaev-majorana-chain,yakovenko}\nIn this effect, the Josephson tunnel current mediated via two Majorana fermions\ncarries charge $e$, not $2e$; i.e. a Cooper pair with charge $2e$ splits into two Cooper pairs of Majorana fermions\nwith charge $e$.\nThe fractionalized character also results in non-local correlation of two Majorana fermions.\\cite{bolech,tewari,nilsson,fu-majorana}\n Two Majorana fermions spatially well separated exhibit a certain type of long-range correlation which is independent of the distance between the two Majorana fermions, and a phenomenon similar\nto teleportation can occur.\nThese distinct features of Majorana fermions, fractionalization and non-local correlation, have not yet been experimentally established.\n\nAs mentioned before, a Majorana fermion in topological superconductors is realized as the equal-weight \nsuperposition of an electron and a hole. Thus, its topological character does not appear\nin charge transport. However, since energy is conserved, heat transport phenomena can be\nused for characterization of topological responses. In fact, the quantum thermal Hall effect is possible to occur\nin topological superconductor with broken time reversal symmetry. The heat current is carried by Majorana surface states.\nAt sufficiently low temperatures, the $T$-linear coefficient of the thermal Hall conductivity is quantized, reflecting\nthe total number of chiral Majorana modes carrying heat currents.\n\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. \nIn section \\ref{sec:top}, we introduce basic concepts of topological superconductors, and \nin section \\ref{sec:symmetry} we discuss classificaiton of topological phases of superconductors based on\nsymmetry of systems, and present topological invariants characterizing distinct topological phases.\nWe also discuss classification of topological defects such as a vortex which plays an important role in superconductors.\nIn section \\ref{sec:realization}, we explain fundamental properties of topological superconductors, \nparticularly, focusing on the case with broken time-reversal symmetry, for which typical features\nsuch as Majorana surface states emerge. We also present various scenario for realization of topological superconductors in real materials.\nIn section \\ref{sec:materials}, we overview candidate materials of topological superconductors, mentioning\ncurrent experimental situations. From section \\ref{sec:non-abelian} to section \\ref{sec:thermal}, we \ndiscuss exotic phenomena raised by Majorana fermions.\nIn section \\ref{sec:non-abelian}, we review the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions in topological superconductors.\n\nWe introduce basic ideas of the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana fermions, and discuss \npossible experimental detection schemes for this intriguing phenomenon.\nIn section \\ref{sec:4pi-josephson}, we consider  the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, and \nin section \\ref{sec:non-local}, we overview non-local correlation effects of Majorana fermions such as \"teleportation\".\n\n\n\nIn section \\ref{sec:thermal}, thermal responses of Majorana fermions are discussed.\n\n\nIn section \\ref{sec:TQC}, we present an elementary introduction to topological quantum computation utilizing Majorana fermions.\nIn section \\ref{sec:interaction}, recent development of our understanding on interaction effects in topological superconductors is reviewed. \nIn section \\ref{sec:weyl},  we overview basic properties of Weyl superconductivity, which is another topological phase of superconductors,\ncharacterized by the existence of Weyl fermions as bulk gapless quasiparticles. The chiral anomaly associated with Weyl fermions raises various exotic phenomena.\n\n\\section{Topological superconductor}\n\\label{sec:top}\n\n\\subsection{Andreev bound state}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Various Andreev bound states and corresponding topological\n numbers.} \n\\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c}\n\\hline\\hline\nEnergy dispersion & Chiral& Helical& Conical &Flat\\\\ \n &($E=c k_y$) &($E=\\pm c k_y$) & ($E=\\pm c\\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$)& ($E=0$)\\\\ \\hline\nTopological number & TKNN number & $Z_2$ number & 3D winding number & 1D\n\t\t winding number \\\\ \\hline\nRelated materials & Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ & Noncentrosymmetric SCs & $^3$He-B &\nHigh-$T_{\\rm c}$ cuprates \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular} \n\\label{table:1}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{edge_mode.eps}\n\\caption{Edge and surface states in topological superconductors. (a)\nChiral Majorana edge mode. (b) Helical Majorana edge mode. (c) Helical\nsurface Majorana fermion. (d) Flat edge mode.}\n\\label{fig:edge_mode}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\nThrough the study of unconventional superconductivity, it has been recognized\nthat some unconventional superconductors may support surface\nbound states called Andreev bound state.\\cite{kashiwaya-review}\nFor instance, chiral $p$-wave superconductors, which are supposed to be realized\nin Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, host Andreev bound states with liner dispersion, as\nillustrated in Fig.\\ref{fig:edge_mode}(a).\n\n\nBefore recent study of topological superconductors, however, such Andreev bound\nstates had been understood, on a case-by-case basis, as a result of\ninterference between quasiparticles due to the Andreev reflection. \nRecent development of topological superconductors provides a unified\ntopological viewpoint for these Andreev bound states, which  \nhas been obtained by using  \nanalogy between the Andreev bound states and edge states in quantum\nHall effects.\nIndeed, it has been known that quantum Hall states also have gapless edge\nstates similar to the Andreev bound states in chiral $p$-wave\nsuperconductors.\\cite{volovik,read-green}\n\nFor quantum Hall states, the existence of edge states has been\nunderstood as a consequence of intrinsic topology of the\nsystem.\\cite{hatsugai} \nFirst, for a bulk quantum Hall state without boundary, the Hall\nconductance $\\sigma_{xy}$ is given  by a topological number $\\nu_{\\rm\nTKNN}$ called\nThouless-Kohmoto-den Nijs- Nightingale (TKNN) number (or\nthe first Chern number in mathematics),\\cite{thouless, kohmoto} \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{xy}=\\frac{e^2}{h}\\nu_{\\rm TKNN}, \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $e$ is the unit charge of electron and $h$ is the Planck constant.\nOn the other hand, if the quantum Hall state has a boundary, the Hall\nconductance is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{xy}=\\frac{e^2}{h}N, \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $N$ the number of edge states on the boundary.\\cite{halperin1}\nBecause these two different equations express the same quantum\nHall effect,  the bulk topological number $\\nu_{\\rm TKNN}$ should be the same as $N$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nu_{\\rm TKNN}=N. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus we can understand the existence of edge states, i.e., a nonzero value\nof $N$ as a result of a nonzero value of $\\nu_{\\rm TKNN}$.\n\n\nGenerally, such relations between bulk topological numbers and gapless\nboundary states are called ``bulk-boundary correspondence''.\n\nRemembering the similarity between Andreev bound states and edge states\nin quantum Hall states,\none can naturally expect a similar correspondence for the Andreev bound\nstates. \nActually, even for chiral $p$-wave superconductors, we can define the\nTKNN number for the bulk systems without boundary, which yields to\n$|\\nu_{\\rm TKNN}|=1$\n(or $|\\nu_{\\rm TKNN}|=2$ if the spin-degree of freedoms is taken into account).\nLike quantum Hall states, the existence of the edge state in\nchiral $p$-wave superconductors can be explained by the intrinsic\ntopology of the bulk systems.\\cite{volovik,read-green}  \n\nDepending on symmetry of the system, Andreev bound states may\nhave different energy dispersions other than that in\nFig.\\ref{fig:edge_mode}(a).   \nFrom the viewpoint of the bulk-boundary correspondence, these\ndifferences result from differences in the corresponding\ntopological numbers.\nFor instance, there exist Andreev bound states with flat dispersion on\nthe $(110)$ surface of high-$T_{\\rm c}$ cuprates\n(Fig.\\ref{fig:edge_mode}(d)).\\cite{hu,tanaka-kashiwaya,ryu-hatsugai}\nIn this case, the corresponding topological number is not the TKNN\nnumber but the one-dimensional winding number.\\cite{sato-tanaka}\nFurthermore, on surfaces of the superfluid $^3$He-B, there appear\nAndreev bound states with conical dispersion\n(Fig.\\ref{fig:edge_mode}(c)),\\cite{hara-nagai} which corresponding topological number is the \nthree-dimensional winding number.\\cite{grinevich, schnyder, sato2009} \nWe summarize the relation between various Andreev bound states and the\ncorresponding topological numbers in Table \\ref{table:1}.\n\nSuperconductors with non-zero bulk topological numbers are called\ntopological superconductors.\nThe existence of gapless Andreev bound states on their surfaces is one of\ndirect evidences for topological superconductivity.\n\n\n\\subsection{Majorana fermion}\n\\label{subsec:Majorana}\n\nAs mentioned above, there is a similarity between Andreev bound states\nand edge states in quantum Hall states. \nWhat is a difference between them?\n\nThe most important difference between them is that Andreev bound states\ndo not carry definite charges, whereas edge states in quantum Hall states\ndo. \nIn superconducting states, an electron can become a hole by the\nformation of a Cooper pair.\n(See Fig.\\ref{fig:Cooper}.)\nTherefore, fermionic excitations in the superconducting state are\nnaturally expressed as a superposition of an electron $c_\\sigma({\\bm\nx})$ and a hole $c^{\\dagger}_\\sigma({\\bm x})$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Psi({\\bm x})=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{\\uparrow}({\\bm x}) \\\\\nc_{\\downarrow}({\\bm x})\\\\\nc_{\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}({\\bm x})\\\\\nc_{\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}({\\bm x})\n\\end{array}\n\\right). \n\\label{eq:nambu}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nSince an electron and a hole have an opposite charge, \nthe quasiparticle cannot have a\ndefinite charge.\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=2cm]{Cooper.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{A electron (black circle) becomes a hole (white circle) by\n formation of a Cooper pair.}\n\\label{fig:Cooper}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\n\nThe wave function in Eq.(\\ref{eq:nambu}) satisfies\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Psi^*({\\bm x})=\\tau_x \\Psi({\\bm x}), \n\\quad\n\\tau_x=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n0 & {\\bm 1}_{2\\times 2}\\\\\n{\\bm 1}_{2\\times 2} & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:Majorana_condition}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich implies that the quasiparticle $\\Psi({\\bm x})$ is essentially\nthe same as its antiparticle $\\Psi^{*}({\\bm x})$. Such a self-conjugate\nproperty is not seen in ordinary fermions. \nThis self-conjugate condition is called the Majorana condition because\na class of fermions named Majorana fermions satisfies this condition.\n\nMajorana fermions are Dirac fermions satisfying the self-conjugate\nproperty. Originally, they were introduced as an elementary particle.\\cite{majorana}\nAs discussed in the above, any quasiparticles in\nsuperconductors, i.e. \neven those in conventional $s$-wave superconductors satisfy the Majorana\ncondition, but they are not Majorana fermions in general since most of\nthem are not Dirac fermions.    \nSurface Andreev bound states, however, may have linear dispersions, and\nthus their effective Hamiltonian are given by the Dirac\nHamiltonian. \nHence, the Andreev bound states naturally can be considered as Majorana\nfermions in condensed matter physics.\\cite{read-green, stone-roy}  \n\n\\section{Symmetry and Topology}\n\\label{sec:symmetry}\n\nIn this section, we discuss classification of topological superconductors based on symmetry of systems.\\cite{schnyder,kitaev-class,ryu-furusaki,altland}\nAs will be seen below, particle-hole symmetry and time-reversal symmetry play crucial roles.\nWe also present topological invariants which characterize distinct topological phases.\nIn subsections \\ref{subsec:PHS} and \\ref{subsec:TRS}, we discuss generic spinful cases, \nand consider the case with spin-rotation symmetry in section \\ref{subsec:spin-rot} and \nthe spinless (or fully-spin-polarized) case in section \\ref{subsec:spinless}.\nThe case with additional crystal symmetry such as mirror reflection symmetry\nis discussed in sections \\ref{subsec:TCS} and \\ref{subsec:Ising}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\caption{Symmetry of SC and the relevant topological numbers.

superconductors is given by  \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta{\\bm k}}\n{\\cal E}_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\bm k})c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}c_{{\\bm k}\\beta}\n+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha\\beta{\\bm k}}\\left(\n\\Delta_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\bm k})\nc^{\\dagger}_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}c^{\\dagger}_{{-\\bm k}\\beta}\n+{\\rm h.c.}\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $c_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}$ ($c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}$)\nis the annihilation (creation) operator of electron with momentum ${\\bm\nk}$, and the suffix $\\alpha$ labels internal degrees of freedom for fermion\nsuch as spin, orbit, and so on.\nThe first term in the right hand side is the Hamiltonian of electron in the\nnormal state, and the second one is added in the superconducting state by the formation of Cooper\npair with a gap function $\\Delta_{\\alpha\\beta}({\\bm k})$.\nHere the anticommutation relation of $c_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}^{\\dagger}$\nyields $\\Delta({\\bm k})=-\\Delta^t(-{\\bm k})$. \nThe above Hamiltonian is called as the Bogoliubov de Genne (BdG)\nHamiltonian.\n\nThe BdG Hamiltonian can be written in the following matrix form,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{\\bm k}}\\Psi^{\\dagger}({\\bm k}){\\cal H}({\\bm\n k})\\Psi({\\bm k}), \n\\label{eq:BdG_matrix}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n{\\cal E}({\\bm k})& \\Delta({\\bm k})\\\\\n\\Delta^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})& -{\\cal E}^t(-{\\bm k})\n\\end{array}\n\\right)_{\\alpha\\beta}\n,\\quad\n\\Psi({\\bm k})=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}\\\\\nc^{\\dagger}_{-{\\bm k}\\alpha}\n\\end{array}\n\\right), \n\\label{eq:BdG_matrix3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the summation for the index $\\alpha$ is implicit in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdG_matrix}).   \nWe have neglected the constant term caused by the anticommutation relation\nbetween $c_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}$ and $c_{{\\bm k}\\alpha}^{\\dagger}$ since it\nmerely shifts the origin of the energy.\nPerforming the Fourier transformation, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Psi({\\bm k})=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}}\n\\sum_{\\bm x}e^{i{\\bm k}{\\bm x}}\\Psi({\\bm x}),\n\\quad \n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})=\n\\sum_{\\bm x}e^{i{\\bm k}{\\bm x}}{\\cal H}({\\bm x}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwe also have the BdG Hamiltonian\nin the coordinate space,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{\\bm x}{\\bm y}}\\Psi^{\\dagger}({\\bm x}){\\cal\n H}({\\bm x}-{\\bm y})\\Psi({\\bm y}) \n\\label{eq:BdG_matrix2}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nThis form indicates that  fermionic excitations of\na superconductor are given as a superposition of an electron and hole,\n$\\Psi({\\bm x})$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq:nambu}),\nas mentioned in Sec.\\ref{subsec:Majorana}.\nThe quasi-particle spectrum in the superconducting state is obtained by solving\nthe eigen equation of the BdG Hamiltonian\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})|u_n({\\bm k})\\rangle=E_n({\\bm k})|u_n({\\bm k})\\rangle. \n\\label{eq:BdG_equation}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Particle-hole symmetry (Charge-conjugation symmetry)}\n\\label{subsec:PHS}\n\nAs discussed in Sec.\\ref{subsec:Majorana}, the wave function $\\Psi({\\bm\nx})$ satisfies the self-conjugate condition in \nEq.(\\ref{eq:Majorana_condition}). \nCorrespondingly, the BdG Hamiltonian in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdG_matrix2}) should\nbe invariant \nunder the replacement of $\\Psi^{\\dagger}({\\bm x})$ and $\\Psi({\\bm\nk})$ with their conjugates $\\Psi^t({\\bm x})\\tau^t_x$ and $\\tau_x\n\\Psi^*({\\bm x})$.\nBecause ${\\cal H}$ transforms as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&&{\\cal H}\\rightarrow\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{\\bm x}, {\\bm y}}\\Psi^{t}({\\bm\n x})\\tau_x^t {\\cal H}({\\bm x}-{\\bm y})\\tau_x\\Psi^{*}({\\bm y})\n\\nonumber\\\\\n&&= -\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{\\bm x},{\\bm y}}\\Psi^{\\dagger}({\\bm x})\\left[\n\\tau^t_x \n{\\cal H}({\\bm y}-{\\bm x})\\tau_x\n\\right]^t\n\\Psi({\\bm y})\n\n\n+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\bm x}{\\rm tr}{\\cal H}({\\bm x})\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\label{eq:BdG_PH}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nunder the replacement, this requirement imposes a constraint on ${\\cal\nH}({\\bm x})$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\tau_x^t {\\cal H}({\\bm x})\\tau_x=-{\\cal H}^t(-{\\bm x}).\n\\label{eq:PHS_coordinate}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere note that the last term in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdG_PH}) vanishes\nif ${\\cal H}({\\bm x})$ satisfies Eq.(\\ref{eq:PHS_coordinate}).\nIn the momentum space, the constraint is given as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\tau_x^t {\\cal H}({\\bm k})\\tau_x=-{\\cal H}^t(-{\\bm k}).\n\\label{eq:PHS_momentum}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nUsing the hermiticity of ${\\cal H}({\\bm k})$, Eqs.(\\ref{eq:PHS_coordinate}) and (\\ref{eq:PHS_momentum}) are also\nwritten as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal C}{\\cal H}({\\bm x}){\\cal C}^{-1}=-{\\cal H}({\\bm x}),  \n\\quad\n{\\cal C}{\\cal H}({\\bm k}){\\cal C}^{-1}=-{\\cal H}(-{\\bm k}),  \n\\label{eq:PHS}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere ${\\cal C}=\\tau_x K$ with the complex conjugate operator $K$. \nThe constraint of the BdG Hamiltonian in Eq. (\\ref{eq:PHS}) is\ncalled as the particle-hole symmetry. \nWe can check directly that ${\\cal H}({\\bm k})$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdG_matrix3}) actually has the\nparticle-hole symmetry.\nThe particle-hole symmetry is one of the fundamental symmetries in the\nAltland-Zirnbauer classification scheme,\\cite{altland} and \nsystems supporting the particle-hole symmetry are classified as class D.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the particle-hole symmetry, one can show that a positive energy\nstate is always paired with a negative energy state.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, from a solution $|u_n({\\bm k})\\rangle$ of Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdG_equation}) with a\npositive (negative) energy $E_n({\\bm k})>0$ ($E_n({\\bm k})<0$), one can obtain a solution with\nmomentum $-{\\bm k}$ as\n\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n|u_{-n}(-{\\bm k})\\rangle ={\\cal C}|u_n({\\bm k})\\rangle,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich has a negative (positive) energy $-E_n({\\bm\nk})$. \n\nIn one-dimension, the paired structure of the\nspectrum enables us to\ndefine a topological number:\\cite{Qi-Hughes-Zhang}\nThe paired structure implies that the gauge filed constructed from\nnegative energy states, \n$\nA^{(-)}(k)=i\\sum_{E_n(k)<0}\\langle u_n(k)|\\partial_k u_n(k)\\rangle, \n$\nis not independent of that from positive energy states,\n$\nA^{(+)}(k)=i\\sum_{E_n(k)>0}\\langle u_n(k)|\\partial_k u_n(k)\\rangle, \n$\nwhich leads to the relation $A^{(-)}(k)=A^{(+)}(-k)$.\nTherefore, the geometrical phase of $A^{(-)}(k)$ along the one-dimensional\nBrillouine zone (BZ)\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_{\\rm geom}=\\oint_{\\rm BZ} dk A^{(-)}(k) \n\\label{eq:Z2_PHS}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nis recast into\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_{\\rm geom}&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\oint_{\\rm BZ} dk \\left[\nA^{(+)}(k)+A^{(-)}(k)\n\\right]\n\\nonumber\\\\\n&=&\\frac{i}{2}\\oint_{\\rm BZ} dk \n\\sum_{n}\\langle u_n(k)|\\partial_k u_n(k)\\rangle \n\\nonumber\\\\\n&=& \\frac{i}{2}\\oint_{\\rm BZ}dk {\\rm tr}\\left[U^{-1}(k)\\partial_k U(k)\\right]\n\\nonumber\\\\\n&=& \\frac{i}{2}\\oint_{\\rm BZ}dk \\partial_k\\ln\\left[{\\rm det}U(k)\\right], \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $U_{mn}(k)$ is given by the $m$-th\ncomponent of $|u_n(k)\\rangle$. \nThe U(1) phase of ${\\rm det}U(k)$ contributes to the line\nintegral, and thus \nthe uniquness of ${\\rm det}U(k)$ on BZ yields $\\gamma_{\\rm geom}=\\pi\nN$ with an integer $N$.\nFinally, taking into account the $2\\pi$ ambiguity of $\\gamma_{\\rm geom}$, we have two\nphysically defferent values of $\\gamma_{\\rm geom}$, i.e. $\\gamma_{\\rm geom}=0$ and $\\pi$, \nwhich define the ${\\bm Z}_2$ topological invarint for one-dimensional\nsuperconductors.  \nThe system is topologically trivial (non-trivial) if $\\gamma_{\\rm\ngeom}=0$ ($\\gamma_{\\rm geom}=\\pi$).\n\nAs mentioned in Sec.\\ref{sec:top}, in two-dimensions, class D superconductors\nare topologically characterized by the TKNN integer,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nu_{\\rm TKNN}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{\\rm BZ}d^2k {\\cal F}_{xy}^{(-)}({\\bm k}), \n\\label{eq:TKNN}\n\\end{eqnarray} \nwhere ${\\cal F}_{xy}^{(-)}({\\bm k})$ is the field strength of the gauge field \n${\\cal A}_\\mu^{(-)}({\\bm k})=i\\sum_{E_n({\\bm k})<0}\\langle u_n({\\bm\nk})|\\partial_{k_{\\mu}} u_n({\\bm k})\\rangle$.\nOn the other hand, no topologically nontrivial class D superconductor\nexists in three dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Time-reversal symmetry and chiral symmetry}\n\\label{subsec:TRS}\n\nLike topological insulators, the presence of time-reversal symmetry also\nenriches the topological strucuture in superconductors. \n\n\n\n\nThe quasiparticle state $|u({\\bm k})\\rangle$ has a Kramers partner ${\\cal\nT}|u(-{\\bm k})\\rangle$ with time-reversal operator ${\\cal T}$, and \nwe can define various topological numbers, \nusing the Kramers degeneracy.\nThe Kane-Mele's\n${\\bm Z}_2$ \ninvariant for quantum spin\nHall states also characterizes topology of two-dimensional time-reversal\ninvariant superconductors, but the coexistence of particle-hole symmetry gives\nother topological numbers as well.\n\nIn one-dimension, we can generalize the ${\\bm Z}_2$ topological\ninvariant introduced in Sec.\\ref{subsec:PHS}.\\cite{sato2010} \nAlthough $\\gamma_{\\rm geom}$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq:Z2_PHS}) itself is always trivial \nbecause the Kramers doublet equally contributes to $\\gamma_{\\rm geom}$, \none can avoid it by taking only one state for each Kramers pair to\ncalculate the geometric phase.\nNamely, for the Kramers pair $\\left(|u_{2n-1}(k)\\rangle,\n|u_{2n}(k)\\rangle\\equiv {\\cal T}|u_{2n-1}(-k)\\rangle\\right)$,\nthe geometrical phase $\\gamma_{{\\rm geom}/2}$ of $|u_{2n-1}(k)\\rangle$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_{{\\rm geom}/2}=\\oint_{\\rm BZ} A_{1/2}^{(-)}(k),\n\\label{eq:Z2_DIII}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nA_{1/2}^{(-)}(k)=i\\sum_{E_{2n-1}(k)<0}\\langle u_{2n-1}(k)|\\partial_k u_{2n-1}(k)\\rangle \n\\end{eqnarray}\nis quantized as $\\gamma_{{\\rm geom}/2}=0,\\pi$ $({\\rm mod.} 2\\pi)$.\nTherefore, $\\gamma_{{\\rm geom}/2}$ defines a ${\\bm Z}_2$ topological invariant in\none-dimension.\nThat is, when $\\gamma_{{\\rm geom}/2}=\\pi \\,({\\rm mod}. 2)$, the system is topologically non-trivial.  \nHere note that the geometrical phase $\\gamma'_{{\\rm geom}/2}$ of\nthe remaining state $|u_{2n}(k)\\rangle$ is equal to $\\gamma_{{\\rm geom}/2}$ up the $2\\pi$-ambiguity,\nand thus it does not define an independent topological invariant.\n\nAs a combination of the time-reversal symmetry ${\\cal T}$ and the\nparticle-hole symmetry ${\\cal C}$, time-reversal BdG Hamiltonians have\nso-called chiral symmetry,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Gamma {\\cal H}({\\bm k}) \\Gamma^{-1}=-{\\cal H}({\\bm k}), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Gamma=i{\\cal T}{\\cal C}$ is a unitary operator with $\\Gamma^2=1$.\nUsing the chiral symmetry $\\Gamma$, one can define a topological\ninvariant as the winding number in\nthree-dimensions,\\cite{schnyder} \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align}\nw_{\\rm 3D}\n=\\frac{1}{48\\pi^2}\\int_{\\rm BZ}  d^3k \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}{\\rm

$\\varepsilon({\\bm k})$ is the energy of electrons in the normal\nstate, which is measured from the Fermi level, and \n$\\mu_{\\rm B}H_z\\sigma_z$ is the Zeeman term. \n${\\bm g}({\\bm k})\\cdot{\\bm

a property similar to chiral $p$-wave superconductors. \n\nTo see the similarity between this system and a chiral $p$-wave\nsuperconductor, we perform the following unitary

the Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction. \nWhereas it is not always the case in reality because the diagonal term\nof the dual Hamiltonian is not the standard electron energy but a\nconstant term $\\Delta-\\mu_{\\rm B}H_z \\sigma_z$, if we apply the Zeeman\nfield beyond a critical value, there appears a topological\nsuperconducting state similar to the chiral $p$-wave superconductors.

(\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}).\nThis means that it is difficult for usual bulk $s$-wave superconductors\nto meet this condition: \nIn general, such a strong magnetic field may\ndestroy $s$-wave Cooper pairs by the Pauli depairing effect or the orbital\ndepairing effect.  \nIn the present case, the Pauli depairing can be avoided\nbecause the Fermi surface is split by the Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction so the Zeeman splitting is strongly suppressed when the Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction is strong enough.\\cite{fujimoto1}\nOn the other hand, the orbital depairing effect cannot be avoided for\nusual bulk superconductors.\n\n\nIt has been know that, however, this difficulty can be solved in\nvarious ways:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item If one consider $s$-wave superfluids of cold atoms,\n       instead of superconductors, one can avoid this\n       problem.\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto1,Zhang-Sarma} \nThis is because Cooper pairs in superfluids are charge neutral so no Lorentz\n       force for the orbital depairing does not arise.\nThe spin-orbit interaction in cold atoms can be created\n       artificially by using a sophisticated laser technique.\\cite{spielman}\n\n\\item A superconducting state of heavy fermions also may not suffer this\n      problem.\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto2}\nBecause the effective mass of heavy fermions can be about a hundred times the\n      electron mass in the vacuum,\n      the Lorentz force is strongly suppressed so the orbital depairing\n      effect does not work. In particular, heavy fermion noncentrosymmetric\n      superconductors have the Rashba spin-orbit interaction at the same\n      time.\n\\item A widely adapted solution is to use proximity induced\n      superconductivity, instead of bulk superconductivity. By putting\n      a semiconductor on the top of an $s$-wave superconductor, $s$-wave\n      superconductivity can be induced in the semiconductor.\\cite{fujimoto,sau,alicea}\nThe Zeeman field in the semiconductor can be\n      given in two different manners. \nThe first one is to consider a heterostructure illustrated in\n      Fig.\\ref{fig:JDSau}.\n\n\n\nIn this case, the electron energy in the semiconductor is\n      Zeeman-split by proximity effects of the exchange interaction\n      of the attached magnet.\n\nSince no direct magnetic field is applied,\n      no Lorentz force for the orbital depairing is induced.\nThe other way is to apply in-plane Zeeman fields, instead of Zeeman\n      fields in the $z$-direction.\\cite{alicea}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the two-dimensional system, the motion of Cooper pairs in the perpendicular direction\n      is severely restricted, so the orbital depairing becomes ineffective if\n      one applies Zeeman fields in the parallel direction.\nIn both cases, the topological superconductivity in a\n      semiconductor with small $\\varepsilon({\\bm 0})$ is considered in\n      order to met the condition (\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}) easily.\nNote that the heterostructure breaks the inversion symmetry so it\n      naturally induces the Rashba spin-orbit interactions.\n\nThe last idea was generalized to one-dimensional\nnanowires on the top of an $s$-wave superconductor.\\cite{lutchyn,oreg} \nThe Hamiltonian of this system is the same as  Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdGRashba}) with $k_y=0$, \nand Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of the nanowires when the\nsame condition (\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}) is met. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nIn these systems, one can control the topological superconductivity by\nchanging model parameters such as $\\varepsilon({\\bm 0})$\n(namely, the chemical potential) and $H_z$.\nActually, the quantum operation by controlling the topological\nsuperconductivity was proposed in Ref.\\citen{alicea2}.  \n\nSo far, we have considered $s$-wave pairing as the\nsuperconducting gap $\\Delta$. We should note that, however, Majorana\nfermions may appear even for other unconventional pairings.\nIndeed, the details of the gap function does not matter for the argument\nusing the dual Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:dualHamiltonian}) since the \nspin-triplet gap function is induced in the dual Hamiltonian even for\nunconventional pairing. The only difference is that because the gap\nfunction vanishes at ${\\bm k}={\\bm 0}$ for many unconventional pairings,   \nthe condition (\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}) can change like\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n(\\mu_{\\rm B}H_z)^2>\\varepsilon({\\bm 0}). \n\\end{eqnarray} \nTherefore, for systems with small $\\varepsilon({\\bm 0})$, one can\nrealize Majorana fermions even for weak Zeeman fields that do not cause\nthe orbital depairing. \nMajorana fermions in $p$-wave superconductors and $d$-wave\nsuperconductors were discussed in\nRefs.\\citen{sato-fujimoto1, potter}, and\nRefs.\\citen{linder,sato-takahashi-fujimoto2, sato-fujimoto2,law1},\nrespectively.   \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{hetero.eps}\n\\caption{Realization of the Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:BdGRashba}) in a\n heterostrucutre.

From a different point of view,\nthe Majorana zero mode found in this scenario can be associated with the Shiba state which is\nthe bound state formed around a magnetic impurity in a superconductor.\\cite{shiba}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Candidate Materials}\n\\label{sec:materials}\n\nThere are several compounds for candidates of topological superconductors.\nOne of promising materials for time-reversal symmetry broken topological superconductors in class D is Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ which is a candidate of a quasi-two dimensional chiral $p+ip$ superconductor.\\cite{maeno1}\nA representative candidate for time-reversal symmetric topological superconductors in class DIII in three dimensions\nis  Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which is a carrier-doped topological insulator, and is expected to realize\nan odd-parity pairing\nstate.\\cite{CuBiSe1,CuBiSe2,CuBiSe3,CuBiSe4,CuBiSe5,hao-lee,CuBiSe6,yamakage,CuBiSe7,yamakage1,\nhashimoto1,nagai,takami,mizushima,hashimoto2, nematic,matano}\nSince there are already several nice reviews on these materials,\n\\cite{maeno1,maeno2,ando,sasaki-mizushima} we will not discuss them here.\nInstead, we discuss some other possible candidate materials in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Proximity-induced superconductivity in nanowire:\n\n Time-reversal-symmetry-broken (TRSB) superconductor in class D}\n\\label{sec:nanowire}\n\nIn 2012, three experimental research groups independently reported the observation of zero-bias conductance peak in nanowire-superconductor systems,\nwhich may be associated with Majorana zero energy modes at open ends of the nanowire.\\cite{mourik,das,deng}\nIn such nanowire systems, a class D topological superconducting state which harbors Majorana zero-energy states at its open ends realizes for $E_z>\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+\\mu^2} $,\nwhere $E_z$ is the Zeeman energy, $\\Delta$ is the proximity-induced s-wave superconducting gap, and \n$\\mu$ is a chemical potential in the nanowire.\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto1,sau,lutchyn,oreg} \n\n\n\n\n\nThese groups used InSb and InAs for the nanowire, as proposed in refs.\\cite{lutchyn,oreg}.\nZero-bias conductance peak appears when the Zeeman energy $E_Z$ satisfies the above condition, which strongly suggests\nthe realization of Majorana end states.\nAccording to previous theoretical studies,\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto1} \nthe topological phase transition occurs at $E_z=\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+\\mu^2}$, and the bulk energy gap closes at this critical value of $E_z$.\nHowever, in the experimental data of these conductance measurements, gap-closing behaviors were not clearly observed. \nIt was argued by Stanescu et al.\\cite{stanes} that the absence of clear gap-closing behaviors is due to dominant contributions from non-topological\nsuperconducting bands which stem from multi-band character of the nanowires, and do not exhibit gap-closing at $E_z=\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+\\mu^2}$.\nNevertheless, as discussed by several theoretical studies,\\cite{stanes,liu-potter,rainis} \nthe interpretation of these experimental observations is still intricate, and \nit has not yet been established whether the observed zero-bias peaks correspond to signature of Majorana fermions or not.\nFor instance, Liu et al.\\cite{liu-potter} and Rainis et al.\\cite{rainis} argued that disorder effects give rise to low-energy peak of conductance which is due to sub-gap states originating from trivial bands, even in trivial superconducting states.\nWe need further experimental and theoretical investigations to establish the existence of Majorana zero modes in nanowire superconducting systems\nwith strong spin-orbit interactions.\n\n\n\\subsection{Li$_2$Pt$_3$B: time reversal symmetric (TRS) superconductor in class DIII}\n\nIt is expected that the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Li$_2$Pt$_3$B, which has the cubic crystal structure $P4_332$ and $T_c\\sim 2.7$ K,\nmay realize TRS topological superconductor similar to the B phase of the superfluid Helium 3.\nIt is known that the B phase of the superfluid $^3$He is a typical example of TRS topological superfluidity in class DIII.\nThe $\\bm{d}$-vector of this spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing state which characterizes\nthe nontrivial topology is given by $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{k}$ with $\\bm{k}$ a wave number.  \nSince the crystal structure of Li$_2$Pt$_3$B breaks inversion symmetry, the pairing state can not be classified by the parity of Cooper pairs.\nHowever, if the spin-triplet pair component dominates over the spin-singlet component, the system can be a TRS topological superconductor. \nThe NMR measurement for this material suggests the existence of the dominant spin-triplet component.\\cite{zheng}\nFurthermore, the form of the $\\bm{d}$-vector is constrained by the anti-symmetric spin-orbit interaction, the form of which is\n$\\sim \\lambda_{\\rm SO}\\bm{\\sigma}\\cdot\\bm{k}$, respecting the symmetry $P4_332$.\nThis spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the $\\bm{d}$-vector similar to that of the B phase of $^3$He.\nUnfortunately, single crystals of this material have not been synthesized so far, and thus topological properties of Li$_2$Pt$_3$B\nhave not yet been clarified.\n\n\\subsection{In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te: TRS superconductor in class DIII or topological crystalline superconductor}\n\nThere have been extensive studies on crystalline topological insulators (CTI) which are protected by crystalline symmetry in addition to time-reversal symmetry.\\cite{CTI-fu}\nA promising material is the semiconductor SnTe, for which surface Dirac cone bands protected by mirror symmetry\nare observed via ARPES measurements.\\cite{SnTe-ando} \nThe partial substitution of Sn with In induces carrier-doping, rendering the system metallic. \nThe doped CTI In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te exhibits superconductivity with $T_c\\sim 1$ K.\nRemarkably, the zero energy bias peak of the conductance was observed for $x=0.045$, which implies the topological superconducting state\nwith surface zero energy Majorana modes.\\cite{InSnTe}\nThe possible pairing state may be deduced by the group theoretical\nargument.\\cite{InSnTe}\nCorresponding surface states have been investigated\ntheoretically.\\cite{hashimoto}\nThe fermi surfaces of In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te are located around $L$ points in the fcc Brillouin zone.\nIn the vicinity of the $L$ point, the band has $D_{3d}$ point group symmetry, which imposes the constraint on pairing symmetry.\nThere are two possible odd-parity pairing state allowing the Majorana surface states; i.e. $A_{1u}$ and $A_{2u}$.\nThe $A_1u$ state has full energy gap, and thus, it is a TRS topological superconducting state in class DIII.\nOn the other hand, the $A_{2u}$ state has gap-node, and the bulk topological invariant can not be defined.\nHowever, in this gapless superconducting state, a weak topological invariant can be defined in two-dimensional plane crossing\nfully gapped region of the fermi surfaces. Thus, this state is a weak topological superconductor.\n\nFor larger $x$, the superconducting state of In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te is changed to a conventional one, which may be an $s$-wave pairing state.\\cite{InSnTe2,InSnTe3}\nIf the surface Dirac bands protected by mirror symmetry still exist for this case, a vortex in the superconducting state can possess\nthe Majorana zero energy bound state at the intersection between the vortex core and the surface of the system.\\cite{jackiw-rossi}\nAn interesting feature of these Majorana modes is that they are protected by magnetic group symmetry: \nthe symmetry of the system under the combination of time-reversal symmetry operation and mirror reflection \nresults in the enhancement of topological protection of the Majorana zero modes.\\cite{fang}\nAccording to the $K$-theory argument, zero modes in a vortex of two-dimensional superconductor in class D are classified as $Z_2$, which is protected\nby the particle-hole symmetry as discussed in sec. \\ref{subsec:topodefect}.\nThus, multiple Majorana zero modes in the vortex core are not stable, and\nthere is only one topologically protected Majorana bound state.\nHowever, a vortex penetrating the surface of In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te also has the above-mentioned magnetic group symmetry when the vortex line\nis parallel to the mirror plane of the system, the existence of which guarantees the topological protection of the surface Dirac cone.\nThen, the mirror Chern number on this mirror plane leads to $Z$ classification of the vortex core zero-energy bound states.\nThe existence of multiple Majorana zero-energy modes are allowed in this case.\nThis state is regarded as a topological crystalline superconducting vortex state.\n\n\n\\subsection{URu$_2$Si$_2$: Weyl superconductor}\n\nThe heavy fermion system URu$_2$Si$_2$ exhibits the superconducting\ntransition at $T_c=1.45$ K. \nAccording to thermal transport measurements which detect nodal structure of the gap function, a possible pairing state consistent with\nthe space group symmetry is the spin-singlet $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ pairing state.\\cite{URu2Si2-1} \nThe gap function of this state for small $|\\bm{k}|$ is proportional to\n$k_z(k_x+ik_y)$, which is regarded as the $p+ip$-wave symmetry multiplied with the $k_z$ factor.\nThis pairing state breaks time-reversal symmetry in the orbital degrees of freedom, and thus this material\nis a promising candidate of three-dimensional chiral superconductor.\nThe gap function has point nodes for $k_x=k_y=0$ at the north and south poles of the Fermi surface, for which $k_z=k_0$ and $k_z=-k_0$,\nrespectively. Here $\\pm k_0$ is the Fermi momentum at the $\\bm{k}$-points with $k_x=k_y=0$, and for simplicity, we assume a nearly spherical Fermi surface centered\naround the $\\Gamma$ point.\nThese points nodes are Weyl points, which possess monopole charge in the momentum space, and\nthus this system is a Weyl\nsuperconductor.\\cite{sumiyoshi-berry-phase,URu2Si2-2,gos, goswami, kobayashi}\nBasic properties of Weyl superconductors are reviewed in section \\ref{sec:weyl}.\nFor $-k_0< k_z <0$ and $0<k_z<k_0$, the spin-singlet $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ pairing state has \nthe nonzero Chern number $C$ on the $xy$-plane for fixed value of $k_z$, which is equal to $2$. Here the factor $2$ is due to spin degeneracy.\nOn the other hand, $C=0$ for $|k_z|>k_0$. This implies that the point-nodes of the gap function possesses the monopole charge $\\pm 2$ \nin the momentum space.\nThus, the situation is similar to Weyl semimetals for which the Chern number on the two-dimensional $\\bm{k}$-plane between two Weyl points is nonzero.\nFor Weyl superconductors, it is expected that anomalous thermal Hall effect occurs because of the nonzero Chern number, as discussed in sec.\\ref{sec:thermal}. See section \\ref{sec:weyl} for details.\n\nThe spin-singlet $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ pairing state hosts a line in the\n$k_z=0$ plane, and correspondingly, it has a surface zero energy flat\nband on the $(001)$ surface.\\cite{gos, goswami, kobayashi}\nHowever, its associated topological invariant is an accidental chiral\nsymmetry, and the surface flat band is fragile against the surface\nmis-orientation.\\cite{kobayashi} On other surfaces, there exit\ntopological surface arc associated with the coexistence of line and\npoint nodes.\\cite{kobayashi}\n\nTime-reversal symmetry breaking of the chiral pairing state of URu$_2$Si$_2$ was recently examined by the measurement of the Kerr effect.\\cite{kapi} \nFurthermore, the recent measurement of the Nernst effect strongly supports the chiral pairing state of this Material.\\cite{URu2Si2-2,sumiyoshi-berry-phase}\nThe Nernst effect is a transverse thermoelectric  responses akin to the Hall effect, and a good probe for superconducting fluctuations. \nColossal Nernst signal was observed for URu$_2$Si$_2$ just above the transition temperature $T_c$.\\cite{URu2Si2-2} Surprisingly, this signal becomes larger for cleaner samples, which is not consistent with\nthe prediction of conventional theories of superconducting fluctuations. Also, the strong enhancement of the Nernst signal appears in the temperature region where the vortex liquid state is not realized. Thus, the dependence on the purity of samples is not due to pinning effect of vortices.\nThis remarkable experimental result is understood by considering the chiral character of Cooper pair \nfluctuations.\\cite{sumiyoshi-berry-phase}\nChiral superconducting fluctuations give rise to asymmetric skew-scattering of electrons, leading\nto the giant Nernst effect, which is akin to the anomalous Hall effect.\nThis scenario successfully explains the above-mentioned experimental observation, confirming \nthe realization of chiral Cooper pairs in URu$_2$Si$_2$.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{UPt$_3$: crystalline topological superconductor or Weyl superconductor}\n\n\nUPt$_3$ is a heavy fermion superconductor with $T_c\\sim 0.5 $ K.\nThe NMR measurement supports that a spin-triplet pairing state is realized in this system.\\cite{toh}\nUnder applied magnetic fields, three different superconducting phases appear.\nThe pairing symmetries of these phases are still controversial.\nHowever, recent experimental studies strongly suggest that there are two promising candidates for the pairing state\nin the low temperature and low field region, which is so-called the B phase.\\cite{izawa,kerr}\nOne is expressed in terms of the $E_{1u}$ representation of the space group symmetry of this compound\\cite{izawa} and the other one is the $E_{2u}$ representation.\\cite{kerr}\nAlso, even within the $E_{1u}$ representation, there are two possible pairing states; \nthe $E_{1u}$ planar $f$-wave state and the $E_{1u}$ chiral $f$-wave states.\\cite{izawa2}\nThe $E_{1u}$ planar pairing state is characterized by the $\\bm{d}$ vector of the form\n$\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\lambda_a\\bm{b}+\\lambda_b\\bm{c}$ where\n$\\bm{b}$ and $\\bm{c}$ are the lattice vectors of the hexagonal lattice of UPt$_3$, and\n$\\lambda_{a(b)}=k_{a(b)}(5k_c^2-k^2)$ with $a$, $b$, and $c$ the axes of the hexagonal lattice.\nAlso, for higher magnetic fields parallel to the $c$-axis, the $\\bm{d}$ rotates, and changes\nto $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\lambda_a\\bm{b}+\\lambda_b\\bm{a}$ within the $B$ phase.\nOn the other hand, the $E_{1u}$ chiral pairing state and the $E_{2u}$ pairing state break time-reversal symmetry, \nand their $\\bm{d}$ vectors are, respectively, given by\n$\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b) (5k_c^2-k^2)$, \n\nand $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b)^2k_c$.\n\n\n\nWe, first, consider the $E_{1u}$ planar $f$-wave state.\nThe gap function of this state has line and points nodes which give rise to gapless excitations, and thus, it is not a bulk topological superconducting state in the usual sense. However, as elucidated by Tsutsumi et al.\\cite{tsutsumi}, \nfor fixed $k_b=0$,\nthe $E_{1u}$ pairing state has chiral symmetry $\\Gamma$ defined by the product of time reversal symmetry operation $\\mathcal{T}$,\nparticle-hole symmetry operation $\\mathcal{C}$, and mirror symmetry operation with respect to $ac$-plane $\\mathcal{M}_{ac}$: i.e. $\\Gamma=\\mathcal{T}\\mathcal{C}\\mathcal{M}_{ac}$ and the BdG Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}(\\bm{k})$ satisfies\n$\\{\\Gamma,\\mathcal{H}(\\bm{k})\\}=0$ for $k_b=0$.\nThen, using this chiral symmetry, we can define a one-dimensional winding number $w(k_c)$ for $k_b=0$\nwhich characterize the $Z$ non-triviality. For the $E_{1u}$ state, we have $w(k_c)=\\pm 2$ for $k_c\\leq k_F$, and zero\nfor other $k_c$.\nThat is, Majorana modes appear on a surface normal to the $a$-axis, with the energy dispersion $\\sim \\pm vk_b$.\nThese surface Majorana modes is protected by the combination of time reversal symmetry,\nparticle-hole symmetry, and mirror symmetry, and thus it is a crystalline topological superconducting state.\n\nOn the other hand, the $E_{1u}$ and $E_{2u}$ chiral pairing states\n\n\nbreak time-reversal symmetry.\nSince there are point nodes of the gap at $k_a=k_b=0$, and the Fermi surface of UPt$_3$ is three dimensional,\\cite{upt3-fermi} a single-particle excitation from these point nodes behaves as a Weyl fermion, as in the case of URu$_2$Si$_2$.\nThe point node of the $E_{1u}$ chiral state, $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b) (5k_c^2-k^2)$, has the monopole charge $q_m=\\pm 1$, while the $E_{2u}$ state, $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b)^2k_c$, has $qm=\\pm 2$.\nThen, the Chern number on the $k_a-k_b$ plane for fixed $k_c$ between the two point nodes of the $E_{1u(2u)}$ chiral state\nis equal to $2$ ($4$).

Because of the nonzero Chern number, \nthere are Majorana arcs on the surface Brillouin zone for surfaces parallel to the $c$-axis.\nAs in the case of URu$_2$Si$_2$, the anomalous thermal Hall effect, the Kerr effect, and the Nernst effect due to chirality fluctuation are expected to occur.\n\nFor the $E_{2u}$ state, there exists a line node on the $k_c$ plane,\nwhich may result in a surface flat band in the $(001)$ surface.\nA line node in an odd parity superconductor is, however, topologically\nunstable.\\cite{kobayashi-shiozaki}\nCorrespondingly, the surface flat band on the (001) surface is fragile\nagainst the surface mis-orientation and the surface Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction.\\cite{kobayashi}  \n\n\\subsection{Cd$_3$As$_2$: Superconducting Dirac semimetal}\nDirac semimetals are three dimensional materials\nthat possess gapless Dirac points in the bulk Brillouin\nzone, whose low-energy excitations are effectively\ndescribed as Dirac fermions.\nCd$_3$As$_2$ is one of recently discovered Dirac\nsemimetals,\\cite{cd3as21, cd3as22, cd3as23, cd3as24, cd3as25, cd3as26,\ncd3as27, cd3as28} \nin which a superconducting phase transition has been\nreported.\\cite{supercd3as21, supercd3as22, supercd3as23}\nBecause of a zero bias conductance peak in the tunneling\nconductance\\cite{supercd3as22} topological\nsuperconductivity has been expected.\nActually a recent theoretical analysis indicates that unique orbital\ntexture of Dirac points favors topological superconductivity with a\nquartet of surface Majorana fermions.\\cite{kobayashi-sato}\n\n\\section{Non-Abelian statistics}\n\\label{sec:non-abelian}\n\n\\subsection{Exchange operation of Majorana zero-energy modes}\n\\label{sec:exch}\n\nOne of the most intriguing and remarkable features of Majorana zero-energy modes in superconductors is that they obey non-Abelian statistics, which is drastically different from Fermi statistics and Bose statistics.\\cite{moore-read,nayak-wilczek,read-green,ivanov}\nThis novel quantum statistics is a variant of anyon statistics which is realized in fractional quantum Hall effect states, and\nbasically realized in two-dimensional (2D) systems.\nHowever, we note that it is also possible to generalize the non-Abelian statistics to three dimensions, which will be discussed in the next subsections.\nAs is well-known, the conventional quantum statistics is characterized by change of a $U(1)$ phase of a many-body wave function raised \nby exchange of identical particles,\nand hence the many-body state does not depend on the order of the exchange processes.\nIn other words, the exchange operations constitute an Abelian group.\nIn contrast, for the non-Abelian statistics, exchange operations of particles is non-commutative, i.e.\ndifferent order of exchange operations of particles leads to different many-body states.\nAs a matter of fact, the particle-exchange operations (or more precisely, braiding operations\\cite{com1}) \nare described by non-Abelian unitary operators which act on the (topological) ground state space.\nOriginally, it was discussed by Read, Green, and Ivanov that a vortex with a Majorana zero mode in its core obeys\nthe non-Abelian statistics.\\cite{read-green,ivanov} \nHowever, we would like to stress that the non-Abelian statistics is a more general property of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors,\nirrespective of whether they realize in vortex cores or at open boundary edges of a sample.\n\nTo be concrete, let us consider $N$ Majorana zero-energy modes located at the spatial positions denoted by $1$, $2$, $3$, ... , $N$ in a topological superconductor, whose fields are, respectively, give by\n$\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, ...,  $\\gamma_N$.\nHere, all Majorana fields satisfy,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i^2&=&1, \\\\\n\\gamma_i\\gamma_j&=& -\\gamma_j\\gamma_i \\quad\\mbox{for} \\quad i\\neq j.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nA key factor of the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana modes is the following rule for the exchange (braiding) of any pairs of two Majorana fields, $\\gamma_i$\nand $\\gamma_j$.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i\\rightarrow\\gamma_j, \\quad \\gamma_j\\rightarrow -\\gamma_i.\n\\label{eq:rule1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe will see in the next subsection that the exchange (braiding) rule (\\ref{eq:rule1}) gives rise to the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero-energy modes.\nNote that in Eq. (\\ref{eq:rule1}) one Majorana field changes its sign, while the other does not.\nThis peculiar behavior is often understood as an effect of phase-winding of a vortex where a Majorana fermion exists: i.e.\nvortices with Majorana modes accompany branch cut at which the phase jumps by $2\\pi$, and thus, the braiding of two vortices lead\nto phase change $\\pi$ of one of the Majorana fields when the Majorana fermion traverses the branch cut.\\cite{ivanov,stone-chung}\nHowever, as mentioned before, the non-Abelian statistics realizes even for Majorana edge states in a nanowire, \nand Eq.(\\ref{eq:rule1}) holds also in such cases without vortices.\\cite{clarke,halperin-alicea}\nTo see this, let us consider the braiding of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ more precisely.\nTo proceed the argument, we assume that the topological ground state is separated from the first excited state by a finite energy gap,\nand the exchange is carried out adiabatically within this ground state manifold. Then, the Majorana zero modes are\nstill Majorana zero modes after the exchange operation. This exchange operation is described by a unitary operator $U_{1,2}$.\nWe recall that all Majorana fields are expressed by linear combinations of fields of electrons with coefficients given by\nthe wave function of the BdG Hamiltonian.\nThus, according to the adiabatic theorem, after the braiding operation, $\\gamma_{1(2)}$ is moved to $\\gamma_{2(1)}$ with an additional phase factor \ndenoted by $s_{2(1)}$.\nThen, we obtain,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\ns_2\\gamma_2=U_{1,2}\\gamma_1U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}, \\quad \ns_1\\gamma_1=U_{1,2}\\gamma_2U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}.\n\\label{eq:u12}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince $s_1^2\\gamma_1^2=1$, and $\\gamma_1^2=1$, we have $s_1=1$ or  $-1$. Similarly, $s_2=1$ or  $-1$.\nCombining the Majorana zero modes $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, we can construct a complex fermion field \n$\\psi_{12}=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$.\nThe occupation number of the complex fermion $n_{12}=\\psi^{\\dagger}_{12}\\psi_{12}$ is $1$ or $0$.\nThus, the state that consists of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ only is doubly-degenerate.\nMore generally, if $N=2m$ with $m$ an integer, we can construct $m$ complex fermion fields from $2m$ Majorana fields,\nand each complex fermion state is occupied or un-occupied, which leads to the total degeneracy $2^m$. \nThis is so-called topological degeneracy.\nWe note that this degeneracy can not be lifted by local perturbations as long as the system is isolated. This property is important\nin connection with the application to topological quantum computation, which we will mention later.\nSince Majorana fields are given by the superposition of original electron fields, \nthe total number of the complex fermions is nothing but the number of quasiparticles\nwhich arises from breaking up Cooper pairs in a superconductor. \nThis implies that the parity of the total occupation number must be preserved for an isolated system, since  destruction or creation of a Cooper pair changes\nthe number of quasiparticles only by $2$.\nHence, the degeneracy is reduced to $2^{m-1}$ for each parity sector.\nKeeping this in mind, now, we consider how the occupation number,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nn_{12}=\\psi^{\\dagger}_{12}\\psi_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}(1+i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2),\n\\label{eq:n12}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nis affected by the exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$. Operating $U_{1,2}$ on $n_{12}$, we obtain,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{1,2}n_{12}U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i}{2}U_{1,2}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i}{2}s_1s_2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2.\n\\label{eq:un12}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, we used Eq.(\\ref{eq:u12}).\nIn the case of $N=2$, i.e. there are only two Majorana zero modes $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, the parity of the occupation number $n_{12}$ must not be changed by the exchange operation. Then, we have $s_1s_2=-1$. On the other hand, in the case of $N>2$, it is not so trivial whether the parity of $n_{12}$\nis changed or not by $U_{12}$. However, if each Majorana zero modes are spatially well separated, \nthe exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ can not affect the occupation numbers of complex fermion states composed of the other\nMajorana zero modes, i.e.\n$n_{ij}=\\psi_{ij}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{ij}$ with $\\psi_{ij}=(\\gamma_i+i\\gamma_j)/2$ for $i$, $j=3,4,5, ..., N$, and $i\\neq j$.\n\nOtherwise, the exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ can affect fermion states infinitely far away from them ! \nThus, $n_{12}=U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}n_{12}U_{1,2}$ holds, and we obtain $s_1s_2=-1$.\nThis leads to the rule (\\ref{eq:rule1}). Depending on the gauge choice and the choice of the left-handed or right-handed rotation, \nwe have $s_1=1$, $s_2=-1$, or $s_1=-1$, $s_2=1$.\n Note that in the above argument, the presence or absence of vortices does not play any role, and hence\n Eq.(\\ref{eq:rule1}) holds for any Majorana zero modes realized in topological superconductors.\\cite{clarke,halperin-alicea}\n \n The unitary operator $U_{i,j}$ for the exchange operation of $\\gamma_i$ and $\\gamma_j$ can be conveniently \n expressed as,\\cite{ivanov}\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n U_{i,j}=\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_i\\gamma_j\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1-\\gamma_i\\gamma_j).\n \\label{eq:uij}\n \\end{eqnarray} \n It is easy to verify that Eq. (\\ref{eq:uij}) leads to the following exchange rule.\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_j=U_{i,j}\\gamma_iU_{i,j}^{\\dagger}, \\quad \n-\\gamma_i=U_{i,j}\\gamma_jU_{i,j}^{\\dagger}.\n\\label{eq:uij2}\n\\end{eqnarray} \n \n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{Majorana-review-fig-1.eps}\n\\caption{Moving the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_3$ around the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-abe1}\n\\end{figure} \n \n\\subsection{Non-Abelian statistics} \n\\label{sec:non-abe}\n\nAs mentioned above, the non-Abelian statistics is characterized by non-commutativity of the exchange operation of identical particles.\\cite{moore-read,ivanov,read-green}\nTo demonstrate this, we consider a simple system which consists of four Majorana fermions, $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$,\n$\\gamma_3$, and $\\gamma_4$. \nLet us see what happens when the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_3$ is moved adiabatically around the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$, and returns\nto the initial position; i.e. the trajectory encircles $\\gamma_1$, which amounts to twice exchange operation of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$.(Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe1})\n An important observation is that the Majorana fields $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, and\n$\\gamma_3$ constitute the Pauli matrices,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n-i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=\\sigma_z, \\quad -i\\gamma_2\\gamma_3=\\sigma_x, \\quad -i\\gamma_3\\gamma_1=\\sigma_y.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe can verify that $\\sigma_{x,y,z}$ defined above actually satisfy the commutation relation for the Pauli matrices,\n$[\\sigma_{\\mu}, \\sigma_{\\nu}]=2i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\sigma_{\\lambda}$ with $\\mu,\\nu,\\lambda=x,y,z$.\nIt is also noted that from eq. (\\ref{eq:n12}), the occupation number of the complex fermion $\\psi_{12}=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$ \nis expressed by the eigen value of $\\sigma_z$, i.e. $n_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\sigma_z)$.\nWe denote the state vector with the occupation number $n_{12}$ as $| n_{12} \\rangle$, which is also the eigen state of $\\sigma_z$; i.e.\n$\\sigma_z=1$ for $|0\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_z=-1$ for $|1\\rangle$. \nThen, since twice operation of exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$ is expressed as $(U_{3,1})^2=e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\gamma_3\\gamma_1}=-\\gamma_3\\gamma_1=-i\\sigma_y$,\nthe resulting states after the operation are\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n(U_{3,1})^2|0\\rangle =|1 \\rangle, \\quad\n(U_{3,1})^2|1\\rangle =-|0 \\rangle.\n\\label{eq:u31-2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus, this operation changes the parity of the occupation number of $\\psi_{12}$; i.e.\nan electron state $|1 \\rangle $ is transformed into a hole state $| 0\\rangle$ and vice versa. \n\nIn the next section, we will see that this property can be utilized for experimental detection of the non-Abelian statistics.\nIt is noted that, as mentioned before, the parity of the total number of quasiparticles should not change in the superconducting state.  \nIn fact, under the above operation the parity of the occupation number $n_{34}$ of $\\psi_{34}=(\\gamma_3+i\\gamma_4)/2$  \nis also changed, and the total parity change cancels. \nThe state composed of the four Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, and $\\gamma_4$ is completely specified by the occupation numbers $n_{12}$ and $n_{34}$.\nWe denote this state as $|n_{12}, n_{34}\\rangle=(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{12})^{n_{12}}(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{34})^{n_{34}}|0,0\\rangle$.\nSince the parity of $n_{12}+n_{34}$ must be preserved, there are two sets of doubly-degenerate states, i.e.\n$\\{|1, 1\\rangle,  |0, 0\\rangle \\}\n$, and\n$ \\{|1, 0\\rangle,  |0, 1\\rangle \\}\n$. \nThe exchange of any two of the four Majorana fermions operates on these doubly-degenerate states.\nFor instance, the exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$ results in,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|1,1\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,1\\rangle -|0,0\\rangle), \\label{eq:exch1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|0,0\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,1\\rangle +|0,0\\rangle),\\label{eq:exch2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|1,0\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,0\\rangle -|0,1\\rangle), \\label{eq:exch3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|0,1\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,0\\rangle +|0,1\\rangle).\\label{eq:exch4}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThese transformation rules are obtained as follows.\nWe, first, note that from $\\psi_{12}|0,0\\rangle=\\psi_{34}|0,0\\rangle=0$, and $\\psi_{12}|0,1\\rangle=\\psi_{34}|1,0\\rangle=0$,\nit follows $\\gamma_1|0,0\\rangle=-i\\gamma_2|0,0\\rangle$, $\\gamma_3|0,0\\rangle=-i\\gamma_4|0,0\\rangle$, \n$\\gamma_1|01\\rangle=-i\\gamma_2|0,1\\rangle$, and $\\gamma_3|1,0\\rangle=-i\\gamma_4|1,0\\rangle$.\nThen, we have\n$|1, 1\\rangle=\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}\\psi^{\\dagger}_{34}|0,0\\rangle=\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|0,0\\rangle$,   $|0, 0\\rangle=-\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|1,1\\rangle$,\n$|1, 0\\rangle=\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}|0,0\\rangle=\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|0,1\\rangle$, and \n$|0, 1\\rangle=\\psi^{\\dagger}_{34}|0,0\\rangle=-\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|1,0\\rangle$.\nUsing these relations and eq.(\\ref{eq:uij}),\n\nwe obtain eqs.(\\ref{eq:exch1})-(\\ref{eq:exch4}).\n\nAs seen in eqs.(\\ref{eq:exch1})-(\\ref{eq:exch4}), the exchange operation $U_{31}$  is the unitary transformation in the two-dimensional degenerate spaces.\nMore generally, the exchange operations of Majorana fermions defined by (\\ref{eq:uij}) are non-Abelian unitary transformation.\nThe non-commutativity  of $U_{ij}$ can be easily verified as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{i,j}U_{j,k}-U_{j,k}U_{i,j}=-\\gamma_i\\gamma_k=i(2n_{ik}-1). \\label{eq:noncom}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince $n_{ik}=1$ or $0$, the operation of eq.(\\ref{eq:noncom})  on any states leads to a non-zero eigen value.\nThus, Majorana zero-energy states in superconductors obey the non-Abelian statistics characterized by non-commutativity of particle exchange.\n\n\nThere are several proposals on how to realize the braiding operation of Majorana fermions in real systems.\nWe will discuss some of these ideas briefly in the end of section \\ref{sec:TQC}.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\\subsection{Non-Abelian statistics in three dimensions}\n\nIn standard textbooks of quantum mechanics, it is explained that\nin three spatial dimensions, exchanging the positions of two identical point-like particles twice times results in the same state as the original one.\nIn other words, in three dimensions, the exchange of two particles is trivial, and only Bose or Fermi statistics is possible.\nHowever, as explained in the section \\ref{sec:exch}, the exchange rule (\\ref{eq:rule1}), which is the basis of the non-Abelian statistics,\nholds for Majorana zero modes in superconductors irrespective of spatial dimensions.\nIn fact, it was clarified by Teo and Kane that the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero modes is possible even in three-dimensional systems,\nwhen there are point-like defects with Majorana zero modes in a superconductor.\\cite{teo-kane1} \nThey demonstrated that such a defect realizes in heterostructure systems; e.g. the intersection of a vortex of the $s$-wave pairing and the interface between a topological insulator and\na trivial superconductor.  Suppose that there is a vortex line perpendicular to the interface between the superconductor and\nthe topological insulator. The vortex line is terminated at the interface, and the zero-energy Majorana mode appears at this end point of the vortex, behaving as a non-Abelian anyon.\nAn important point here is that the point defect is not really a point-like object, but spatially extended, because of the texture structure composed \nof the spatially-varying order parameter of the superconductor and the band gap which spatially varies from a negative value in the topological insulator region to a positive one in the trivial superconductor region.\nBecause of such additional degrees of freedom, the exchange of two particles can be non-trivial in contrast to conventional quantum statistics.\nIt was also elucidated by Freedman et al. that the non-Abelian statistics of spatially-extended defects with zero modes is associated with \nprojective ribbon permutation statistics, where a texture accompanying a zero mode is intuitively regarded as a ribbon, at the open edge of which\nthere is a localized zero mode.\\cite{freedman}\nAlso, the non-Abelian statistics in three dimensions is possible in three-dimensional network of nanowires in which Majorana zero modes appear\nat boundaries between a topological sector and a trivial sector. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Proposal for experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics}\n\nThere are several proposals for experimental schemes of detection of non-Abelian statistics.\nA remarkable feature of non-Abelian statistics is the non-commutativity of particle exchanges.\nThus, an important issue is how one can detect the non-commutativity in experimentally observable quantities.\nMost of these proposals utilize certain kinds of interferometers, in which the exchange of Majorana fermions can be achieved when\na Majorana edge mode travels encircling a vortex Majorana zero mode inside the bulk of a superconductor.\\cite{law,akhmerov,fu-kane-majorana,butiker} (see Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe2})\nThe signature of the non-commutativity appears in transport properties of the interferometers.\nA simplest example is a class D topological superconductor attached with a single metallic lead (Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe2}).\nA more sophisticated approach proposed by Grosfeld and Stern\\cite{grosfeld} is to utilize the interplay between the Aharonov-Bohm effect and Aharonov-Casher effect.\n\n\\subsubsection{One-lead conductance measurement}\n\\label{sec:one-lead}\n\nWe consider the setup shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:non-abe2}, in which the bulk is a class D topological superconductor in two-dimensions.\\cite{law} \nFor simplicity, we assume that \nthere is only one chiral Majorana gapless mode on the one-dimensional edge of the system.\nThere is a finite tunneling amplitude between\nelectrons (or holes) in the lead  and the gapless edge state.\nThe Hamiltonian for this tunneling process with the amplitude $t$ is given by\\cite{flensberg}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_{\\rm tun}=i\\frac{t}{2}\\gamma(0)\\sum_{\\sigma}[c_{\\sigma}(0)+c_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(0)], \\label{eq:tun}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\gamma(0)$ is a Majorana field for the edge state at $\\bm{r}=0$ where the lead is attached,\nand $c_{\\sigma}(0)$, $c_{\\dagger}^{\\dagger}(0)$ are electron annihilation and creation operators with spin $\\sigma$ at the same point.\nEq.(\\ref{eq:tun}) implies that only one of real fields, $\\gamma_1$, which constitute the complex field $\\psi=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$\ncouples with the Majorana edge state, and the other one $\\gamma_2$ is decoupled.\nLet us consider the situation that there is one vortex inside the bulk superconductor which contains one Majorana zero mode.\nWe denote the Majorana field for the vortex core state as $\\gamma_3$.\nThe tunneling between the lead and the superconductor induce the injection of $\\gamma_1$ into the Majorana edge state. \nThe injected Majorana fermion travels along the circumference of the superconductor encircling the Majorana zero mode $\\gamma_3$ in the vortex core, and returns to the lead, constituting the electron (or hole) field $\\psi^{\\dagger}$ ($\\psi$) with $\\gamma_2$ again.\nIn this process, twice exchange operation of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$ occurs, which is expressed by $(U_{31})^2$ as explained in the section \\ref{sec:non-abe}. Then, from eq.(\\ref{eq:u31-2}), the occupation number of an electron $n=\\psi^{\\dagger}\\psi$ in the lead is changed by\nthis process; i.e. the electron state in the lead is completely converted into the hole state and vice versa.\nWe can generalize this consideration to the case that there are multiple vortices inside the bulk superconductor.\nIf the number of vortices with a single Majorana zero mode in each vortex core is odd,  \nthe conversion between the electron state $|1\\rangle$ and the hole state $|0\\rangle$ occurs with probability of unity\nafter the above process.\nHence, we arrive at a remarkable consequence that the conductance for the attached lead is quantized as $2e^2/h$ when\nthe number of enclosed vortices is odd.\\cite{law}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figure-5-2.eps}\n\\caption{Setup of an interferometer for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics.

mode $\\gamma_1$ propagates along the circumference of the disk,\nencircling the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_3$.\nThis setup realizes the braiding of the Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-abe2}\n\\end{figure} \n\nThe quantized conductance can be derived explicitly by using scattering theory.\nWe, here, follow a sophisticated argument presented by Li, Fleury, and B\\\"uttiker.\\cite{butiker}\nFor simplicity, we consider the case that there are only one chiral Majorana zero mode on the edge of the superconductor \nand one channel of conduction electrons in the lead, and that there are also $n_v$ vortices with Majorana zero modes in the core in the bulk of the superconductor.\nHereafter, it is assumed that the vorticity of each vortex is unity.\n$n_v$ must be odd, since the total number of Majorana fermions including the edge state and the vortex core states, which emerge\nfrom splitting original electrons into two parts, should be even.\nThen, the scattering matrix for electrons and holes at the junction connects\nthe incoming state of electrons and holes $(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm in},\\psi_{\\rm in} )$ and the outgoing state of them \n$(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm out},\\psi_{\\rm out} )$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\psi_{\\rm out} \\\\\n\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm out}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n=S\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\psi_{\\rm in} \\\\\n\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm in}\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, spin indices are omitted.\nIn fact, for any realistic proposals of realizing non-Abelian statistics in\nclass D topological superconductors, \nspin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect split the Fermi surface into two parts, and only one of them is relevant\nto the topological superconducting state.\\cite{sato-fujimoto1,sato-takahashi-fujimoto1,sau,alicea} \nThus, there is only one type of fermions which is the superposition of an up-spin state and a down-spin state.\n$\\psi$ and $\\psi^{\\dagger}$ can be expressed in terms of Majorana fields $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ via,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\psi \\\\\n\\psi^{\\dagger}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n=\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & i \\\\\n1 & -i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\gamma_1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n\\gamma_2/\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus, transforming into the Majorana basis, we obtain the scattering matrix for Majorana modes,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_M=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n-i & i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)S\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & i \\\\\n1 & -i\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\label{eq:sm-s}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs mentioned above, only $\\gamma_1$ couples to the chiral Majorana edge mode, leaving $\\gamma_2$ unaffected.\nThen, $S_M$ is expressed as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_M=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nr_{M1} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $r_{M1}$ is the reflection amplitude for the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$.\n$r_{M1}$ can be derived in the following manner.\nAt the junction between the lead and the superconductor, the Majorana state $\\gamma_1$ tunnels into\nthe chiral Majorana edge state $\\gamma$ with tunneling amplitude $\\sqrt{1-r_0^2}$, where\n$r_0$ is the bare reflection amplitude of $\\gamma_1$ at the junction.\nTraveling around the superconducting region, the Majorana state acquires\nthe phase change $\\theta=n_v\\pi+\\pi+kL$ with $k$ the wave number of the chiral Majorana mode, and $L$ the length of the circumference of \nthe superconductor.\nThe second term of $\\theta$, $pi$, arises from\nthe Berry phase due to the rotation of spin.\nNote that for realistic proposals mentioned before, spin-orbit interaction combined with the Zeeman effect gives rise to\nspin texture structure on the Fermi surface.\nFor instance, in the case of a superconductor with the Rashba spin-orbit interaction $\\lambda\\bm{\\sigma}\\cdot(k_y,-k_x,0)$, the direction of spin is in the $xy$-plane and perpendicular to\nthe propagating direction.\nHence, the motion of a Majorana fermion along the circumference accompanies the rotation\nof spin by $2\\pi$, resulting in the Berry phase $\\pi$.\nAfter traveling around the edge, the Majorana mode tunnels into the $\\gamma_1$ state in the lead again with probability $\\sqrt{1-r_0^2}$.\nThen,  the amplitude for this one turn process is\n$-(1-r_0^2)e^{i\\theta}$, where the total minus sign arises from backward scattering.\nIn a similar manner, the amplitude for the Majorana mode moving around the circumference of the superconductor $n$-times with successive\ntunneling into the lead is given by $-(1-r_0^2)r_0^{n-1}e^{in\\theta}$.\nThen, the total amplitude for the reflection

\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{1+r_0^2-2r_0\\cos\\theta},\n\\label{eq:she}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $V$ is bias-voltage applied to the lead, and $E=v_Mk$ with $v_M$ velocity of the chiral Majorana edge state. \nNote that when $n_v$ is odd and $\\theta=2\\pi\\times\\mbox{integer}$, $|s^{eh}|^2=1$ in the limit of $E\\rightarrow0$, irrespective of the value of $r_0$,\nas seen from eq.(\\ref{eq:she}).\nThus, we obtain the quantized conductance $G=dI/dV|_{V\\rightarrow 0}=2e^2/h$.\nOn the other hand, when $n_v$ is even, i.e. $\\theta=\\pi\\times\\mbox{(odd integer)}$, $|s^{eh}|^2=0$, and hence, $G=0$ irrespective of $r_0$.\nIn fact, in the case of even $n_v$, there is no chiral Majorana zero mode on the edge of the superconductor,\nbecause, as mentioned before, the total number of Majorana fermions including the edge state and the vortex core states, which emerge\nfrom splitting original electrons into two parts, must be even.\nThe vanishing zero-bias conductance $G=0$ for even $n_v$ is consistent with this physical picture.\nThe quantized conductance $G=2e^2/h$ irrespective of the coupling strength between the lead and the superconductor in the case of odd $n_v$\nis very remarkable, characterizing the non-Abelian character which leads to the perfect conversion between an electron and a hole, i.e. eq.(\\ref{eq:u31-2}).\nThe above argument can be generalized to more realistic cases with multiple conducting channels in the lead.\nIn such cases, one of Majorana fermion fields from electrons (or holes) in the lead couples to the chiral Majorana edge mode, if there is only one chiral edge mode, leading to the quantized conductance for this channel.\nHowever, because of contributions from other channels which are not involved with perfect Andreev reflection mediated via a Majorana zero mode, \nthe total conductance is not quantized generally. Thus, the observation of the non-Abelian character of Majorana fermions using the one-lead conductance measurement is rather difficult for realistic experimental setup.\nWe need more sophisticated interference experiments for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics, which will be discussed in the next \nsubsection.\n\nIt is noted that the above calculation for odd $n_v$ can be also applicable to the case of nanowire, for which a Majorana edge state is localized at\nthe junction between the normal lead and the superconducting wire.\nIn this case, $\\theta=0$, and thus we obtain the quantized conductance $G=2e^2/h$.\nHowever, underlying physics for the origin of the quantized conductance here is a bit different from that in the case of 2D systems.\nIn 2D cases considered above, the quantized conductance is a result of the braiding of Majorana fermions, featuring the non-Abelian character,\nwhile in the case of nanowires, it is due to perfect conversion of electrons and holes raised by the Andreev reflection mediated via a Majorana zero mode.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Aharonov-Bohm effect and Aharonov-Casher effet}\n\nAs seen in the previous section, the conductance does not depend on the number of vortices $n_v$ encircled by the trajectory of the propagating chiral Majorana edge mode when $n_v$ is odd.\nThis implies that in the case of odd $n_v$, there is no Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect with respect to the magnetic flux threaded in the superconductor.\nWe note that this remarkable feature is not due to charge-neutrality of Majorana fermions: in fact,\nthere is a sign change of a Majorana field, when it encircles a single vortex, as seen from the expression of a Majorana field in  terms of electron fields:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i=\\sum_{\\sigma}\\int d\\bm{r} [u_{0\\sigma i}(\\bm{r})e^{i\\frac{\\phi}{2}}c_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(\\bm{r})+v_{0\\sigma i}(\\bm{r})e^{-i\\frac{\\phi}{2}}c_{\\sigma}(\\bm{r})],\n\\label{eq:mf-f}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $\\phi$ is the phase of the superconducting gap.\nInstead, however, the absence of the AB effect is understood as a result \nof the non-commutativity of Majorana fermions, i.e. the non-Abelian character.\\cite{stern,bonderson}\nWhen a Majorana fermion travels along the surface edge of the superconductor, the braiding of the Majorana edge mode and a Majorana bound state\nin a vortex core in the superconductor occurs, and the Majorana edge state acquires a phase. \nAnother incoming quasiparticle gives rise to another braiding. However, this does not commute with the previous one because of eq.(\\ref{eq:noncom}), and hence\nthe resulting state cannot be an eigen state of both of these two braiding operators. This results in dephasing of the interference.\nThus, the absence of the AB effect signifies the non-Abelian statistics.\nA scheme utilizing this property for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics was proposed by Grosfeld and Stern.\\cite{grosfeld}\nThey consider Josephson-coupled superconductors threaded by a magnetic flux, in which there is a Josephson vortex at the junction, and furthermore\nelectric charge $Q$ is put in a hole of the superconductor as well as the magnetic flux $\\Phi$. (see Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe3}) \nA key idea is to use the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect associated the Josephson vortex  which carries a Majorana zero mode. \nThe AC effect is realized by changing the role of a charged particle and a magnetic flux in the AB effect; i.e. a quantum mechanical particle with a magnetic dipole moving around a charge flux (an electric field) acquires a phase due to the gauge field associated with the electric field.\nThus, the vortex current $J_v$ carried by the conventional Josephson vortex without a Majorana fermion exhibits\nthe periodic-dependence on the charge $Q$ in the hole of the system, $J_v\\sim J_{v0}+J_{v1}\\cos(2\\pi \\frac{Q}{2e})$. \nHowever, in the setup considered here, the Josephson vortex harbors a Majorana zero mode, and hence\nthe AC effect of the moving Josephson vortex disappears when the number of vortices in\nthe center hole $n_v$ is odd; i.e. there are odd number of Majorana fermions in the inner part of the junction system encircled by the trajectory of the Josephson vortex.\nThe absence of the AC effect is due to the above-mentioned mechanism of dephasing raised by non-commutativity of Majorana fermions in the Josephson vortex and in the inner part\nof the junction.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{AC-effect1-2.eps}\n\\caption{Setup for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics based on the AC effect.\nThe system consists of three part of topological superconductors, which are connected  via Josephson junction regions.\nThe Josephson vortices with Majorana zero modes can propagate along the junction, encircling \nthe charge $Q$ at the center of the system, which leads to the AC effect.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-abe3}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\\section{\"Fractionalization\"-- $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect}\n\\label{sec:4pi-josephson}\n\nAs seen in previous sections, a Majorana fermion field of superconductors emerges from separating the real or imaginary parts of a complex fermion field of an electron.\nIn this sense, an electron fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions.\nIt should be noted that this is not fractionalization raised by intrinsic topological order which is realized in the fractional quantum Hall effect states,\nand leads to fractionalized quasiparticles.\nIn fact, there is no intrinsic topological order in topological superconductors.\nHowever, the \"fractionalization\" into Majorana fermions gives rise to some interesting electromagnetic properties.\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena is the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson \neffect.\\cite{kitaev-majorana-chain,yakovenko,jiang}\nTo explain this, let us consider a Josephson junction system with a ring geometry shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:frac-jose}, where a magnetic flux $\\Phi$ threads the hole of the ring.\nThis is a superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction, and the phase difference between two junction separated via the small insulating region\nis $\\phi=\\frac{2e}{\\hbar}\\Phi$.\nThen, the single-electron tunneling Hamiltonian is\n$H_{1t}=-te^{i\\phi}\\psi_{\\sigma 1}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{\\sigma 2}+h.c.$, where $\\psi_{\\sigma 1}$ and $\\psi_{\\sigma 2}$ are electron fields at two junctions.\nAlso, in the case with Majorana zero-energy modes, the mode expansion of the electron fields is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\psi_{\\sigma i}=u_{\\sigma i}(x)\\gamma_i+\\mbox{(non-zero energy modes)},\n\\label{eq:psimode0}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $i=1$, $2$.\nThus, the single-electron tunneling Hamiltonian reads,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_{1t}=J_Mi\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\cos \\frac{\\phi}{2},\n\\label{eq:h1t}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_M$ is a real constant.\nIn addition to this, there is also a usual Josephson coupling term for Cooper pair tunneling, which is expressed as $H_{2t}=J\\cos\\phi$ with $J$\na Josephson tunneling amplitude.\nSince the system is isolated, the total charge number is conserved, and hence, it\nis an eigen state of the fermion parity (\\ref{eq:n12}); i.e. $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=1$ or $-1$.\nAs seen from (\\ref{eq:h1t}), these parity-eigen state exhibits $4\\pi$-periodicity of the Josephson current as\na function of $\\phi$. This implies that the Josephson current is not carried by Cooper pairs with charge $2e$, but rather by\nparticles with charge $e$; i.e. \"fractionalizaion\" of Cooper pairs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{frac-jose.eps}\n\\caption{(Upper panel) Setup for the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect.

This observation may be a signature of the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. \nHowever, to this date, no other experimental groups have succeeded to confirm this observation.\n\n\\section{Non-local correlation of Majorana fermions and teleportation}\n\\label{sec:non-local}\n\nAs mentioned before, we can interpret the emergence of a Majorana fermion in a superconductor as splitting up a complex fermion field of an electron into real and imaginary parts. From this point of view, one may expect non-local correlation between two spatially separated Majorana fermions.\nThis is, indeed, the case for certain situations.\\cite{ bolech, tewari,semenoff,nilsson,fu-majorana}\nTo deal with this issue, we consider a simple toy model of one-dimensional topological superconductor with a Majorana zero-energy mode localized at\nthe open boundaries of the system. (See Fig.\\ref{fig:non-local})\nWe denote Majorana fields for these edge states at $x=0$ and $L$ as $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, respectively.\nFor this system, the mode expansion of an electron operator with spin $\\sigma$ at $x$, $\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)$, is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)=\\sum_{i=1,2} u_{\\sigma i}(x)\\gamma_i+\\mbox{(non-zero energy modes)}.\n\\label{eq:psimode}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe non-local correlation can be immediately seen from long-distance behaviors of correlation function $\\langle\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)\\psi_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(y)\\rangle$.  \nSince $u_{\\sigma 1(2)}$ is localized around $x=0$ $(L)$, and there are no low-energy excitations other than the Majorana edge states, we have, \nfor $x\\sim 0$ and $y\\sim L$,\\cite{tewari,semenoff,nilsson}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\langle\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)\\psi_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(y)\\rangle \\sim u_{\\sigma 1}(x)u_{\\sigma 2}^{*}(y)\\langle \\gamma_1\\gamma_2 \\rangle.\n\\label{eq:psi-cor}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs mentioned in the previous sections, the topological superconducting phase is the eigen state of the parity operator\n $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=2n-1$ with $n_{12}=\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{12}$,\n as long as the system is isolated.\nThus, the correlation function (\\ref{eq:psi-cor}) is non-zero even for $|x-y|\\rightarrow \\infty$, which signifies non-local correlation raised by\nthe existence of Majorana zero modes.\nThis non-local correlation affects tunneling probability of electrons mediated via Majorana zero modes in an interesting way.\nLet us consider electron tunneling from one end at $x=0$ to the other end at $x=L$.\nThe tunneling amplitude is proportional to the correlation function (\\ref{eq:psi-cor}), which is \nindependent of the distance between two edges $L$.\nThis remarkable $L$-independent behavior of the tunneling  is referred to as \"teleportation\".\nHowever, the experimental detection of this \"teleportation\" is a bit tricky issue, because of the following reason.\nTo distinguish whether an electron detected at $x=L$ comes from the opposite edge at $x=0$ via tunneling or is created from\nbreaking up a Cooper pair in the superconductor, we need to detect the parity state of $\\psi_{12}$ simultaneously.\nAlso, we note that this \"teleportation\" does not break causality, because the information of the one end state, say at $x=0$, must be transferred\nto the observer at $x=L$ in a classical way to detect the above-mentioned tunneling process.\nFurthermore, to probe the Majorana end state, one needs to couple the boundary edge with a lead which allow electrons coming in and going out, resulting\nin the failure of parity conservation.\\cite{budich}  Then, the systems is no longer the eigen state of $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2$, and the average of this operator leads\nto vanishing of correlation eq.(\\ref{eq:psi-cor}).\\cite{bolech}\nConcerning the last point, however, the situation is changed, when there is finite overlap of wave functions of two Majorana edge modes, \nand the topological degeneracy associated with the fermion number parity $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=\\pm 1$ is lifted.\nIn this case, the value of $\\langle \\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\rangle$ is determined by the lowest one of the two state with $n_{12}=0$ and $1$.\nIf the energy splitting between these levels is sufficiently larger than typical excitation energy of electrons in the attached lead,\nthe transition between the states with $n_{12}=0$ and $1$ is suppressed, and non-local correlation eq.(\\ref{eq:psi-cor}) survives.\\cite{nilsson}\nWe note that the correlation eq.(\\ref{eq:psi-cor}) is still independent of the distance between two edges $L$, though the overlap between the two Majorana end states depends on $L$.\n\nThe non-local correlation may be detected by tunneling experiments. The Hamiltonian for tunneling processes between \nthe Majorana end state of the 1D topological superconductor and external leads is expressed by,\\cite{bolech,flensberg}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T&=&\\sum_{k,\\sigma}\\int dx[t_k(x)c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)+h.c.] \\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\\sum_{k,\\sigma}\\sum_{i=1,2}[V_{k\\sigma i}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}-V^{*}_{k\\sigma i}c_{k\\sigma}]\\gamma_i, \n\\label{eq:tun-g}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $c_{k\\sigma}$ ($c_{k\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$) is an annihilation (creation) operator for an electron in the leads, \n$V_{k\\sigma i}=\\int dx t_{k}(x)u_{\\sigma i}(x)$, and $t_k(x)$ is a tunneling amplitude.\nWe have used eq.(\\ref{eq:psimode}) to derive (\\ref{eq:tun-g}).\n$V_{k\\sigma 1}$ and  $V_{k\\sigma 2}$ are the effective tunneling amplitudes between electrons in the leads and Majorana fermions in the superconductor at $x=0$  and $x=L$, respectively. \nUsing $\\psi_{12}=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$, we rewrite the above equation into the form,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T&=&\\sum_{k,\\sigma}[V_{k\\sigma}^{(-)}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}+V_{k\\sigma}^{(-)*}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}c_{k\\sigma} \\nonumber \\\\\n&&+V_{k\\sigma}^{(+)}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}+V_{k\\sigma}^{(+)*}\\psi_{12}c_{k\\sigma}],\n\\label{eq:tunneling2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n$V_{k\\sigma}^{(\\pm)}=V_{k\\sigma 1}\\pm i V_{k\\sigma 2}$.\nThe first line of the right-hand side of eq.(\\ref{eq:tunneling2}) corresponds to the normal tunneling processes between electrons in the leads and\nthe non-local fermion $\\psi_{12}$.\nOn the other hand, the second line of eq.(\\ref{eq:tunneling2}) expresses the Andreev scattering processes mediated via the non-local fermion. \nIn the case that the two Majorana fermions are well separated, and the the level splitting $E_M$ of the two Majorana modes induced by finite overlapping\nis  sufficiently smaller than bias voltage $V$ applied to the lead, local Andreev reflection at each junction dominates, and the non-local correlation does not\nappear.\\cite{bolech} \nIn fact, by integrating out the $\\psi_{12}$ fermion, we obtain the term of the form $(V_{k\\sigma 1}V_{-k\\sigma'1}+V_{k\\sigma 2}V_{-k\\sigma'2})c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}c^{\\dagger}_{-k\\sigma'}$ which corresponds to the local Andreev reflection, and domiantes over \nthe crossed Andreev reflection term of the form $V_{k_{\\sigma}1}V_{-k\\sigma' 2}c_{k\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger}_{-k\\sigma'}$.\nHowever, in the case of the opposite situation, i.e. $E_M \\gg V$, crossed Andreev reflection mediated via $\\psi_{12}$ occurs;\nan electron injected to one end of the superconducting wire is converted to a hole emitted from the other end, characterizing\nthe non-local correlation.\\cite{nilsson}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{non-local-majorana-1.eps}\n\\caption{1D topoogical superconductor with Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ at \nthe edges $x=0$ and $L$, respectively. Metallic leads are attached to the open edges in the lower panel.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-local}\n\\end{figure} \n\nA more remarkable non-local correlation effect appears in a mesoscopic topological superconductor in which the charging energy effect is not negligible.\nThis sophisticated idea was first proposed and examined by Fu.\\cite{fu-majorana,egger1,egger2} An important point of this idea is that \nfor sufficiently large Coulomb energy, the charge conservation yields\nthe phase fluctuation of the superconducting gap, which suppresses the local Andreev reflection mentioned above. \n\nLet us consider a 1D mesoscopic-size superconductor which is not grounded, but a capacitor is inserted between the system and the ground.\nNote that the zero energy states with $n_{12}=0$ and $n_{12}=1$ are still degenerate, \nthough the total number of Cooper pairs $_{\\rm pair}$ are constrained by the charging energy.\nThus, for sufficiently large charging energy, and with a proper bias voltage, which controls\nthe total number of electrons in the superconductor, \nthe lowest energy states are doubly degenerate corresponding to $n_{12}=0$ and $1$.\nThere are two possibility of the doubly-degenerate states; i.e.\n(i) $(N_{\\rm pair}, n_{12})=(N,0)$, and $(N,1)$, \n(ii)  $(N_{\\rm pair},n_{12})=(N-1,1)$, and $(N,0)$. \nIn the case (i), the number of Cooper pairs is not changed, while, in the case (ii), the change of $n_{12}$ \nfrom $0$ to $1$ accompanies\nbreaking of a Cooper pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo take into account the phase fluctuation explicitly, we include the phase operator $\\phi$ in the mode expansion of an electron field (\\ref{eq:psimode}),\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)=\\sum_{i=1,2} u_{\\sigma i}(x)\\gamma_ie^{-i\\frac{\\phi}{2}}+\\mbox{(non-zero energy modes)},\n\\label{eq:psimode2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThen, for the case (i), the tunneling Hamiltonian between normal metal leads and the superconductor \nwhich couple at $x=0$ and $L$\nis,\\cite{egger1}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T=\\sum_{k,\\sigma}[V_{k\\sigma 1}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}+iV_{k\\sigma 2}^{*}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}c_{k\\sigma}+h.c.]\n\n\\label{eq:tun-tele}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nTo derive eq.(\\ref{eq:tun-tele}), we have applied a gauge transformation to $\\psi_{12}$ field.\nEq.(\\ref{eq:tun-tele}) implies that the single-electron tunneling from the terminal 1 to the terminal 2 mediated via the non-local fermion $\\psi_{12}$ occurs, in spite of the absence of single-particle excitations in the bulk of the\nsuperconductor at sufficiently low temperatures. \nRemarkably, this tunneling process is independent of the length of the superconductor.\nIt may be legitimate to call this process \"teleportation\" of single electron mediated via Majorana fermions.\nThis effect is a result of non-local correlation of Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$.\nOn the other hand, for the case (ii), we have,\\cite{egger1}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T=\\sum_{k,\\sigma}[V_{k\\sigma 1}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}e^{-i\\phi}+iV_{k\\sigma 2}^{*}\\psi_{12}c_{k\\sigma}e^{i\\phi}+h.c.].\n\n\\label{eq:tun2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince $e^{i\\phi}$ ($e^{-i\\phi}$) is the raising (lowering) operator for the number of Cooper pairs,\nthe first (second) term of eq.(\\ref{eq:tun2}) creates (annihilates) the $\\psi_{12}$ fermion accompanying \nbreaking (formation) of a Cooper pairs, preserving the total electron charge.\nEq.(\\ref{eq:tun2}) also induces the single-electron tunneling from the terminal 1 to the terminal 2 mediated\nvia $\\psi_{12}$, causing \"teleportation\" of electrons.\nAs a matter of fact, after integrating over $\\psi_{12}$ field in eq.(\\ref{eq:tun-tele}) or (\\ref{eq:tun2}), we obtain\nthe term of the form $V_{k\\sigma 1}V_{k'\\sigma' 2}^{*}c_{k\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{k'\\sigma'}$, and there is no\nAndreev scattering term. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above results are understood as follows.\nThe phase fluctuation suppresses the Andreev reflection mediated via Majorana bound states at open edges, \nin contrast to the case without charging energy expressed by eq.(\\ref{eq:tunneling2}). \nAs a result, only normal single-particle tunneling processes survive because of the charge conservation, leading to the tunneling between\nelectrons at two open edges mediated via the Majorana modes. \n\n\n\nWe stress that this \"teleportation\" does not break causality because of the above-mentioned reason.\nThis effect can be experimentally detected as the AB effect.\nLet us consider the setup shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:tele}, \nwhich consists of a topological superconducting wire with Majorana zero modes at boundary edges\nattached with a normal metal lead, constituting a ring geometry threaded by a magnetic flux.\nBecause of the single-electron resonant tunneling mediated via Majorana modes, at sufficiently low temperatures for which\nquantum coherence of electrons in the normal metal lead is retained, \nthe AB effect with the periodicity $2\\phi_0$ with $\\phi_0=h/2e$ appears.\nThis is remarkably contrasted with the case without Majorana zero modes, for which the AB effect is absent, since\nsingle-electron coherence is suppressed by the superconducting gap, and coherence of Cooper pairs does not survive in the normal metal lead.\n\nThe above result also implies that the charge transport of the topological superconducting nanowire\nvia the two Majorana end states leads to the quantized conductance $G=e^2/h$, which is a half of \nthe conductance in the case of the Andreev scattering mediated via the Majorana zero mode discussed in sec.\\ref{sec:one-lead}. This is due to the suppression of the Andreev scattering at the two ends as mentioned above.\nThe conductance $G=e^2/h$ also characterizes \"teleportation\" of an electron through the superconducting nanowire\nvia the Majorana end states.\\cite{fu-majorana,egger1}\n\nWe close this section by mentioning that non-local correlation also appears as entanglement of spin states of Majorana fermions.\\cite{flensberg-spin,pascal-spin}\nFor instance, for a topological superconducting wire in the class D, \nthe spin density of a Majorana end state is correlated with that at the other open end. \nThe detection of the spin correlation at two open ends may signify the existence of Majorana fermions.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{tele.eps}\n\\caption{Setup for \"teleportation\" of electrons via Majorana fermions.

From their analysis, \nthe thermal Hall conductivity for transport currents reads as\\cite{niu,cooper,streda}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 59732, "prevtext": "\nwhere ${\\rm BZ}$ is the three-dimensional BZ.\nThis topological invariant characterizes three-dimensional time-reversal\ninvaraint topological superconductors/superfluids such as $^3$He B-phase.\n\n\nUsing the chiral symmetry, we can also define the topological invariant\\cite{wen-zee}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nw_{\\rm 1D}=\\frac{i}{4\\pi}\\oint_C  dk_{\\mu}{\\rm tr}\n\\left[\\Gamma{\\cal H}^{-1}\\partial_{k_{\\mu}}{\\cal H}\n\\right],\n\\label{eq:windingnumber_1D}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith a closed loop $C$ in BZ.\nWhereas $w_{\\rm 1D}$ is found to be zero for one-dimensional\ntime-reversal invariant superconductors, \nit can be nonzero when $C$ encloses a line (point)\nnode of superconductors in three (two) dimensions.\\cite{sato2006, beri,\nyada,schnyder-ryu1, sato-tanaka}\nFor instance, nodes in the high-$T_{\\rm c}$ cuprate have nonzero $w_{\\rm\n1D}$.

Each block-diagonal subsector has a definite eigen\nvalue of $J_z$,\nand thus no mixing is allowed between different subsectors.\nFurthermore, \nusing the other commutation relations, $[J_{x,y}, {\\cal H}({\\bm k})]=0$,\none also finds that the $J_z=-1$ subsector are essentially the same as the\n$J_z=1$ subsector. Therefore, it is enough to consider only the $J_z=1$\nsector.\nActually, the BdG Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:BdG_matrix}) is rewritten in\nterms of the following reduced Hamiltonian in the $J_z=1$ sector,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\sum_{{\\bm k}} \\psi^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})h({\\bm k})\\psi({\\bm k}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nh({\\bm k})\n=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\epsilon({\\bm k}) & \\psi({\\bm k})\\\\\n\\psi({\\bm k}) & -\\epsilon^{t}({\\bm k})\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\quad \n\\psi({\\bm k})\n=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\\\\nc_{\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})\n\\end{array}\n\\right), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\epsilon({\\bm k})$ and $\\psi({\\bm k})$ are defined as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal E}({\\bm k})=\\epsilon({\\bm k})s_0,\n\\quad \n\\epsilon^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})=\\epsilon({\\bm k}),\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\Delta({\\bm k})=i\\psi({\\bm k})s_y,\n\\quad\n\\psi^t({\\bm k})=\\psi(-{\\bm k}).\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\nWe should note here that the reduced Hamiltonian $h({\\bm k})$ does not\nhave the original\nparticle-hole symmetry: Because of the\nanticommutation relation\n$\\{{\\cal C}, J_i\\}=0$, the particle-hole symmetry maps a state $|u({\\bm\nk})\\rangle$ with $J_z=1$ to ${\\cal C}|u({\\bm k})\\rangle$ with a\ndifferent eigenvalue, i.e. $J_z=-1$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nJ_z {\\cal C}|u({\\bm k})\\rangle=-{\\cal C}J_z|u({\\bm\n k})\\rangle=-{\\cal C}|u({\\bm k})\\rangle.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSo the $J_z=1$ sector cannot keep the original particle-hole symmetry. \n \n\nAlthough $h({\\bm k})$ cannot retain the original particle-hole\nsymmetry, it has a its own alternative one:\n\n\nBecause of the commutation relation $[J_x{\\cal C}, J_z]=0$,\nthe combination of $J_x$ and ${\\cal C}$\nmaps the $J_z=1$ sector to itself, which defines the ``spin-rotaion\nparticle-hole symmetry'' ${\\cal C}_J\\equiv J_x{\\cal C}$ in the $J_z=1$ sector. \n(One can also consider $J_y{\\cal C}$ as a combined particle-hole\nsymmetry, but it eventually defines the same symmetry as $J_x{\\cal C}$\nin the $J_z=1$ sector).\nIn terms of the reduced Hamiltonian $h({\\bm k})$, the spin-rotation\nparticle-hole symmetry is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal C}_J h({\\bm k}){\\cal C}_J^{-1}=-h(-{\\bm k}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\cal C}_J=i\\tau_y K$.\nWhile the original particle-hole symmetry that obeys\n${\\cal C}^2=1$, the spin-rotation particle-hole symmetry satisfies\n${\\cal C}_J^2=(J_x{\\cal C})^2=-1$.\nIn the Altland-Zirnbauer scheme, systems having such particle-hole\nsymmetry is called as class C.\n\nIf ${\\cal H}({\\bm k})$ is time-reversal invariant, so is the reduced\nHamiltonian $h({\\bm k})$, but in a manner similar to the particle-hole\nsymmetry, its\ntime-reversal transformation is\ndifferent from the original one:\nSince the original time-reversal transformation flips the spin of\nelectrons,  $h({\\bm k})$ defined in the $J_z=1$ sector does\nnot keep the original time-reversal symmetry. \n\nInstead, \nthe $J_z=1$\nsector has the ``spin-rotation time-reversal symmetry'' ${\\cal T}_J\\equiv\nJ_x{\\cal T}$ as a combination of $J_x$ and ${\\cal T}$. \nCorrespondingly, $h({\\bm k})$ satisfies\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal T}_J h({\\bm k}) {\\cal T}_J^{-1}=h(-{\\bm k}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\cal T}_J=K$. \nDifferent from the original time-reversal symmetry\n${\\cal T}$, which satisfies ${\\cal T}^2=-1$, the spin-rotation\ntime-reversal symmetry ${\\cal T}_J$ obeys ${\\cal T}_J^2=1$.\nSystems with ${\\cal C}_J$ and ${\\cal T}_J$ are called as class CI.\n\nTopological numbers for class C and class CI systems are summarized in\nTable \\ref{table:Periodic}. Note that only even numbers are possible in\nthe topological numbers.\nFrom the bulk-boundary correspondence, \nthis means that only even numbers of surface gapless states are possible\nin these classes of topological superconductors.\nTherefore, to realize locally unpaired Majorana fermions in topological\nsuperconductors, we need the strong spin-orbit interaction or\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs which break the SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry.\n\n\\subsection{Spinless superconductors}\n\\label{subsec:spinless}\n\nAs discussed in the previous section, the SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry must be\nbroken in order to realize locally unpaired Majorana fermions.\nA simple system with broken SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry is\nfully spin-polarized electrons.    \nFully spin-polarized electrons can be regarded as spinless\nelectrons since the spin degrees of freedom are completely locked in a\nparticular direction.  \nSuperconducting states of fully spin-polarized electrons are called\nas spinless superconductors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping only up-spin electrons and up-spin holes in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdG_matrix}), one can obtain\nthe BdG Hamiltonian for spinless superconductors,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{{\\bm k}}\n\\psi_{\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\psi_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}),\n\\quad\n\\psi_{\\uparrow}({\\bm

E}^t_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k})   \n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere ${\\cal E}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})={\\cal E}^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\n$, and $\\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}^t({\\bm\nk})=-\\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k})$.\nAs well as the original BdG Hamiltonian, the spinless BdG Hamiltonian\n$h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})$ has the particle-hole symmetry,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal C}h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}){\\cal C}^{-1}=-h_{\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k}), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nand thus it is classified as class D.\n\nSpinless superconductors cannot be invariant under ${\\cal T}$\nsince the ordinary time-reversal operation flips the spin of electrons, \nNevertheless, they may be invariant under a combination of the spin-flip\nand the time-reversal, which we denote ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}$\nIn term of the spinless BdG Hamiltonian, the\ncombined time-reversal symmetry reads\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal T}_{\\rm s} h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}){\\cal T}_{\\rm s}^{-1}=h_{\\uparrow}(-{\\bm k}), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}=K$. ${\\cal E}_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})$ and\n$\\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}({\\bm k})$ should be real in order to have the ${\\cal\nT}_{\\rm s}$-invariance.\nThe time-reversal invariant spinless superconductors are characterized\nby ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}$ and ${\\cal C}$ obeying ${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}^2=1$ and ${\\cal\nC}^2=1$, being classified as class BDI in the Altland-Zirnbauer\nclassification.  \nClass BDI can be topologically non-trivial in one-dimension, but cannot\nin two and three-dimensions. \nLike class DIII, class BDI has the chiral symmetry as a combination of\n${\\cal T}_{\\rm s}$ and ${\\cal C}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Gamma_{\\rm s} h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k})\\Gamma_{\\rm\n s}^{-1}=-h_{\\uparrow}({\\bm k}),\n\\quad \n\\Gamma_{\\rm s}={\\cal T}_{\\rm s}{\\cal C}. \n\\end{eqnarray} \nThe one-dimensional topological number in class BDI is given\nby\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nw^{\\rm BDI}_{\\rm 1D}=\\frac{i}{4\\pi} \\int_{\\rm BZ}dk{\\rm tr}\\left[\\Gamma_{\\rm s}\nh_{\\uparrow}^{-1}\\partial_k h_{\\uparrow}\\right].\n\\label{eq:1dW}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\\subsection{Topological defect}\n\\label{subsec:topodefect}\n\nIn the presence of a defect like a vortex, the BdG Hamiltonian depends\non the distance ${\\bm R}$ from the defect, ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$,\nas well as the momentum ${\\bm k}$.\nConsidering topology of ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$ away from the\ndefect, we can examine the topological stability of the defect and\ngapless defect modes at the same time.\\cite{teo-kane2} \n\nFor this purpose, consider a $D$-dimensional sphere $S^D$ \nsurrounding the defect in $d$-dimensions. \nFor instance, consider $D=1$ ($D=2$) dimensional sphere $S^1$ $(S^2)$ for a line\n(point) defect in $d=3$ dimensions.\nThe BdG Hamiltonina ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$ is now defined on the\nbase space $({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})\\in T^d\\times S^D$ with the\n$d$-dimensional Brillouine zone $T^d$.\nAway from the defect, the system is gapped, so in a manner similar to\nuniform superconductors, one can define various nontrivial topological\nnumbers for ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$.\n\nAmong the topological numbers for ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$, some do\nnot change their value even when one neglects either the\n${\\bm k}$-dependence  or ${\\bm R}$-dependence of ${\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})$. \nThe former ${\\bm k}$-independent topological numbers are topological\nnumbers of the defect itself, which ensures the stability of the defect,\nwhile the latter ${\\bm R}$-independent ones are nothing\nbut the bulk topological numbers without the defect. \nFrom the rest topological numbers, we can predict the existence of gapless modes\nlocalized on the defect.\n\nFor instance, away from the core, a vortex in a two dimensional\nsuperconductor is well-described by the following BdG Hamiltonian,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k}, {\\bm R})=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n{\\cal E}({\\bm k}) \n& \\Delta({\\bm k})e^{i\\theta}\\\\\n\\Delta^{\\dagger}({\\bm k})e^{-i\\theta} \n& -{\\cal E}^{-t}(-{\\bm k})  \n\\end{array}\n\\right) \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith ${\\bm k}=(k_x, k_y)$ and ${\\bm R}=(R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta)$.\nHere $\\theta$ is the angle around the vortex.\nThe vortex can host a Majorana zero mode localized on the core, which\nexistence is ensured by the topological invariant\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\nu=\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2}\\int_{T^2\\times S^1}\\epsilon^{ijk}{\\rm tr}\n\\left[{\\cal A}_i\\partial_j{\\cal A}_k+i\\frac{2}{3}{\\cal A}_i{\\cal\n A}_j{\\cal A}_k\\right]\n\\quad {\\rm mod.} 2,  \n\\label{eq:CS}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the gauge field matrix $({\\cal A}_i)_{mn}({\\bm k}, \\theta)$ is defined as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n({\\cal A}_i)_{mn}({\\bm k},\\theta)=-i\\langle u_m({\\bm k},\n \\theta)|\\partial_i u_n({\\bm k},\\theta)\\rangle, \n\\quad \n(i=k_x, k_y, \\theta), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith negative energy states $|u_n({\\bm k},\\theta)\\rangle$ of ${\\cal H}({\\bm\nk},\\theta)$. \nHere the trace in Eq.(\\ref{eq:CS}) is taken for all the negative energy states.\n\nA systematic classification of topological defects and their gapless\nmodes has been performed based on the K-theory. \n\n\\subsection{Topological crystalline superconductor}\n\\label{subsec:TCS}\n\nIn addition to the particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries,\nsuperconductors may have crystal symmetries.\nSuch material dependent symmetries also influence on their topological\nproperties.\\cite{mizushima-sato,teo,ueno,chui,zhang1,fang,liu-law,benalcazar,mizushima-sato1,morimoto}\n\nFor instance, consider the mirror reflection symmetry\nwith respect to the $xy$-plane,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal M}_{xy}{\\cal H}({\\bm k}){\\cal M}^{-1}_{xy}={\\cal H}(k_x, k_y, -k_z), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere ${\\cal M}_{xy}$ is the mirror reflection operator. \nSince the BdG Hamiltonian ${\\cal\nH}(k_x, k_y, 0)$ on the mirror invariant plane at $k_z=0$ commutes with ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$, ${\\cal\nH}(k_x, k_y, 0)$ is block diagonal in the diagonal basis of ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$. \nFor each block-diagonal subsector with a definite eigenvalue of\n${\\cal M}_{xy}$, the mirror Chern number can be introduced as a Chern number\nof the subsector. \nWhen the mirror Chern number is nonzero, gapless states appears on\nsurfaces preserving the mirror reflection symmetry. \nThe gapless states are stable as far as the mirror symmetry is retained.\n\nWhereas a similar mirror-protected topological surface state exists in\ninsulators,\\cite{CTI-fu, CTI-ex1, CTI-ex2, CTI-ex3}  superconductors have their own novel properties.\\cite{ueno} \nIn superconductors, two different mirror reflection symmetries\nare possible for the same crystal structure:\nA superconducting state keeps the mirror reflection symmetry of the\nnormal state when the gap function is invariant under the mirror reflection,\nbut this is not only possibility.\nEven when the gap function changes it sign under the mirror reflection, \nthe superconducting state may support a mirror reflection symmetry as a\ncombination of the original mirror reflection and a U(1) gauge rotation\nfor the gap function. \nFor the former (latter), mirror-even (mirror-odd) gap function, ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$ is given by ${\\cal M}_{xy}^{+}=is_z\\tau_z$ (${\\cal\nM}^-_{xy}=is_z\\tau_0$). \n\n\n\n\nThe two different mirror reflection\nsymmetries realize different mirror-protected surface state:\nFor the mirror-even case, the mirror reflection operator ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}^+$ commutes with the charge conjugation operator ${\\cal\nC}$. Thus by applying ${\\cal C}$ on an eigenstate $|\\lambda\\rangle$ with the\neigenvalue $\\lambda=\\pm i$ of ${\\cal M}_{xy}^+$, we have an eigenstate\nwith an opposite eigenvalue $-\\lambda$. (Note that ${\\cal C}$ is anti-unitary.)\nTherefore, the particle-hole symmetry merely interchanges the two mirror\nsubsectors, so each mirror subsector does not have its own\nparticle-hole symmetry. \nAs a result, a surface state in each mirror subsector is not\nself-conjugate, and thus it is a Dirac fermion. \nOn the other hand, for the mirror-odd case, ${\\cal M}_{xy}^-$\nanticommutes with ${\\cal C}$. In this case, the charge conjugation operator\n${\\cal C}$ maps a mirror eigensector into itself, so each mirror\nsubsector has its own particle-hole symmetry. \nTherefore, a surface state or a vortex state in each mirror subsector can be\na self-conjugate Majorana fermion.\nThe non-Abelian statistics of the mirror protected Majorana fermions\nis discussed in Ref.\\citen{sato-yamakage-mizushima} \n\nCrystal symmetries other than mirror reflection symmetry also\nprotect topological states.\n\nA complete classification of topological crystalline\ninsulators/superconductors and topological defects protected by\norder-two space group symmetries is given in\nRefs.\\citeonline{shiozaki-sato,shiozaki-sato-gomi}. \n\n\\subsection{Majorana Ising property}\n\\label{subsec:Ising}\n\nCrystals may have an anti-unitary symmetry ${\\cal T}_G$ as a combination of\ntime-reversal ${\\cal T}$ and a crystal symmetry $G$. \nSuch an anti-unitary symmetry, which is called magnetic symmetry, can\nsurvive even when both ${\\cal T}$ and ${\\cal G}$ are broken.\nFor example, the magnetic mirror reflection symmetry with respect to the\n$xy$-plane is obtained by combining the mirror reflection ${\\cal\nM}_{xy}$ with the time-reversal ${\\cal T}=is_y K$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}{\\cal H}({\\bm k}){\\cal\n T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}^{-1} \n={\\cal H}(-k_x, -k_y, k_z),\n\\end{eqnarray} \nwith ${\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}={\\cal T}{\\cal M}_{xy}$.\nWhen we apply a magnetic field normal to the $z$-direction, both of the mirror\nreflection and time-reversal symmetries are explicitly broken, but the magnetic\nmirror reflection symmetry ${\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}$ remains.\nAs is shown below, \nthe magnetic symmetry also stabilizes topological\nphases,\\cite{sato-fujimoto1, mizushima-sato, mizushima-sato1, fang} in which \nMajorana fermions show a unique anisotropic response to magnetic\nfields.\\cite{sato-fujimoto1, chung1, higashitani, shindou, mizushima-sato}\n\nFirst, we note that \nthe magnetic symmetry\n${\\cal T}_G$ results in\na chiral crystal symmetry $\\Gamma_G$,\nby combining it with the particle-hole symmetry.\nThen, along a one-dimensional line in the momentum subspace invariant under $G$,\nwe can define a one-dimensional winding number in a similar manner as\nEq.(\\ref{eq:windingnumber_1D}).\nAs a result, we may have gapless state ensured by the one-dimensional\nwinding number:\nFor the magnetic mirror reflection symmetry ${\\cal T}_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}$, we\nhave the chiral mirror symmetry, \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}} {\\cal H}({\\bm k})\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}^{-1}\n=-{\\cal H}(k_x, k_y, -k_z),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}=e^{i\\alpha}{\\cal C}{\\cal T}{\\cal M}_{xy}$\n(Here the phase $\\alpha$ is determined so as $\\Gamma_{{\\cal\nM}_{xy}}^2=1$.)\nThen, say, for a line with a fixed $k_x$ in the mirror invariant plane at\n$k_z=0$, we can define the topological invariant \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nw_{\\rm 1D}(k_x)=\\frac{i}{4\\pi}\\oint d k_y \n{\\rm tr}\\left[\\Gamma_{{\\cal M}_{xy}}{\\cal H}^{-1}(k_x, k_y, 0)\n\\partial_{k_y} {\\cal\n\t

$y$-axis.\n\n\nOne can show that the zero modes $|u_0\\rangle$ protected by the magnetic\nsymmetry ${\\cal T}_{G}$ are eigenstates of the chiral crystal operator\n$\\Gamma_{G}$.\nAt the same time, from the particle-hole symmetry, \n$|u_0\\rangle$ satisfies\n${\\cal C}|u_0\\rangle=|u_0\\rangle$ by choosing its phase properly.\nThe latter condition implies that the zero modes are self-conjugate\nMajorana fermions, and the former one determines the spin and/or orbital\nstructure of the Majorana zero mode. \nIn particular, for spinful systems with the magnetic mirror reflection\nor the magnetic $C_2$ rotation, \nfrom these two conditions, one can show that the density operator of the\nMajorana zero modes is identically zero, and the spin density operator of the\nMajorana zero modes is nonzero only in a particular\ndirection.\\cite{mizushima-sato, shiozaki-sato} \nTherefore, the Majorana zero modes can couple to a magnetic field only in a\nparticular direction, resulting in an anisotropic magnetic\nresponse.\n\n\\section{Realization of topological superconductors supporting Majorana fermions}\n\\label{sec:realization}\n\nIn this section,we explain basic properties of topological superconductors, \nparticularly, focusing on class D systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, for which typical features\nsuch as the existence of Majorana fermions

of topological superconductors supporting Majorana fermions is a\nspinless chiral $p$-wave superconductor in two dimensions.\\cite{read-green} \nThe Bogoliubov de Genne (BdG) Hamiltonian is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\sum_{\\bm k}\n(c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bm k}}, c_{-{\\bm k}})\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc_{\\bm k}\\\\\nc^{\\dagger}_{-{\\bm k}}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{k_x^2+k_y^2}{2m}-\\mu_0 & \\Delta_0(k_x+ik_y)\\\\\n\\Delta_0^*(k_x-ik_y) & -\\frac{k_x^2+k_y^2}{2m}+\\mu_0\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\label{eq:BdGchiralp}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nNow, following the original argument by Read and Green,\\cite{read-green} we consider the case\nof small $\\mu_0$.\nUnder this assumption, the Fermi momentum becomes small so we can\nneglect the ${\\bm k}^2$ term in the Hamiltonian.\nEquation (\\ref{eq:BdGchiralp}) reduces to \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}({\\bm k})\\rightarrow\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\mu_0 & \\Delta_0(k_x+ik_y)\\\\\n\\Delta_0^*(k_x-ik_y) & \\mu_0\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\label{eq:BdGchiralp2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nUsing this simplified Hamiltonian, we first examine the edge state.\nFor this purpose, \nconsider a two dimensional semi-infinite system which extends to the\npositive $x$ direction, with the boundary at $x=0$.\nTo realize such a system \nwe replace $k_i$ and $\\mu_0$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdGchiralp2}) as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nk_i\\rightarrow -i\\partial_i,\n\\quad\n\\mu_0\\rightarrow \\mu(x), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mu(x)=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n-\\mu_0 <0,&\\mbox{for $x<0$} \\\\\n\\mu_0 >0,&\\mbox{for $x>0$}\n\\end{array}\n\\right. .\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe latter equation implies that no electron exists in the $x<0$ region,\nso it effectively realizes a semi-infinite system with $x>0$. \nThe edge state is examined by solving the BdG equation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\mu(x) & \\Delta_0[-i\\partial_x+\\partial_y]\\\\\n\\Delta_0[-i\\partial_x-\\partial_y] & \\mu(x)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nu \\\\\nv\n\\end{array}\n\\right)=E\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nu \\\\\nv\n\\end{array}\n\\right). \n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe can find a solution localized at x=0:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nu_{k_y} \\\\\nv_{k_y}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)=\nN\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\ni^{1/2} \\\\\ni^{-i/2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\exp\\left[\nik_y y-\\int_0^x dx'\\frac{\\mu(x')}{\\Delta_0}\\right], \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $N$ is a real normalization constant. The energy spectrum of this\nedge state is linear in the momentum $k_y$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nE=\\Delta_0 k_y. \n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nTo see that the edge state is a Majorana fermion, consider the mode\nexpansion,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc(x) \\\\\nc^{\\dagger}(x)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)=\\sum_{k_y}\\gamma_{k_y}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nu_{k_y} \\\\\nv_{k_y}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)+\\cdots. \n\\end{eqnarray} \nThen, from the relation $u_{k_y}=v_{-k_y}^*$, one finds that\n$\\gamma_{k_y}$ satisfies the Majorana condition in the momentum space,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_{k_y}=\\gamma^{\\dagger}_{-k_y}. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nAlso, for $\\gamma_{k_y}$, the time-dependent BdG equation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\ni\\partial_t c(x)=[c(x), {\\cal H}] \n\\end{eqnarray}\nreduces to the one-dimensional Dirac equation in the momentum space,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\ni\\partial_t \\gamma_{k_y}=\\Delta_0 k_y \\gamma_{k_y}. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus, $\\gamma_{k_y}$ is a Majorana fermion.\n\nA vortex in this system also supports a Majorana zero\nmode. The BdG Hamiltonian with a vortex is obtained by replacement  \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nk_i\\rightarrow (-i\\partial_i+eA_i)\\equiv -i{\\cal D}_i,\n\\quad\n\\Delta_0 \\rightarrow \\Delta e^{-i\\theta},\n\\quad \\mu_0\\rightarrow \\mu(r)\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray} \nin Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdGchiralp2}).\nHere $r$ is the distance from the vortex core, and $\\theta$ is the angle\naround the vortex.\n$A_i$ is the gauge potential of the vortex flux which can be\napproximated as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nA_i=-\\partial_i\\theta/2e. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis gauge potential is singular at $r=0$, but the singularity can be\navoided by taking $\\mu(r)$ as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mu(r)=\\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n-\\mu_0<0, & \\mbox{for $r\\rightarrow 0$}\\\\\n\\mu_0>0, & \\mbox{for $r\\rightarrow\\infty$ }\n\\end{array}\n\\right. .\n\\end{eqnarray}\nBecause the chemical potential is negative near the vortex core,\nelectrons cannot approach there, so the\nsingularity becomes harmless.\nThe zero mode is obtained by solving the BdG equation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\mu(r) & \\Delta e^{-i\\theta}(-i{\\cal D}_x+{\\cal D}_y)\n\\\\\n\\Delta (-i{\\cal D}_x-{\\cal D}_y)e^{i\\theta}\n& \\mu(r)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nu_0 \\\\\nv_0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)=0, \n\\end{eqnarray}\nand the solution is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nu_0 \\\\\nv_0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)=N \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\ni^{1/2} \\\\\ni^{-1/2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\exp\\left[-\\int_0^r dr'\\frac{\\mu(r')}{\\Delta}\\right], \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith a real normalization constant $N$. \nThe quantum operator of the zero mode $\\gamma$,\nwhich is defined as the coefficient of the expansion\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nc({\\bm x})\\\\\nc^{\\dagger}({\\bm x})\n\\end{array}\n\\right)=\n\\sqrt{2}\\gamma\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\nu_0 \\\\\nv_0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)+\\cdots , \n\\end{eqnarray}\nsatisfies the Majorana condition\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma=\\gamma^{\\dagger} \n\\label{eq:Majoranacond}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand the anticommutation relation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\{\\gamma^{\\dagger}, \\gamma\\}=1/2.\n\\label{eq:Majoranaanticommu}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere we have used  \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma=\\int dxdy\\left[u_0^*({\\bm x})c({\\bm x})+\nv_0^*({\\bm x})c^{\\dagger}({\\bm x})\n\\right]/\\sqrt{2} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nand\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\{c^{\\dagger}({\\bm x}), c({\\bm x}')\\}=\\delta({\\bm x}-{\\bm x}'),\n\\nonumber\\\\\n\\{c({\\bm x}), c({\\bm x}')\\}\n=\\{c^{\\dagger}({\\bm x}), c^{\\dagger}({\\bm x}')\\}\n=0,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nto derive these relations.\nEquations (\\ref{eq:Majoranacond}) and (\\ref{eq:Majoranaanticommu}) show that $\\gamma$ is a Majorana\nzero mode. \n\nIn a similar manner, one can show that $N$ well-separated vortices\nsupport $N$ Majorana zero modes satisfying\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i^2=1,\n\\quad\n\\gamma_i\\gamma_j=-\\gamma_j\\gamma_i,  \n\\end{eqnarray} \nfor $i\\neq j$.\nLater, we will argue that this relation is an important ingredient to\nrealize the non-Abelian statistics \n\n\\subsection{Dirac systems}\n\nMajorana zero modes and thus non-Abelian statistics can be realized\neven in an $s$-wave superconducting state. \nThis possibility was first pointed out in 2003.\\cite{sato} \nHere we will review the idea of this paper.\n\nThe basic idea is to consider a two-dimensional bulk Dirac fermion\nsystem instead of an ordinary electron one. \nAs was discussed in Sec.\\ref{subsec:Majorana}, quasiparticles in superconducting states\nmay satisfy the Majorana condition.\nThus, if we consider bulk Dirac fermions, they automatically realize\nMajorana fermions even in an $s$-wave superconducting state.    \nIn the Nambu representation with the basis $\\Psi'({\\bm x})=(c^{\\uparrow}({\\bm x}),\nc_{\\downarrow}({\\bm x}), c^{\\dagger}_{\\downarrow}({\\bm x}),\n-c^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow}({\\bm x}))$, the BdG Hamiltonian of the Majorana\nfermions is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-i\\sigma_i\\partial_i & \\Phi^*\\\\\n\\Phi & i\\sigma_i\\partial_i\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:BdGDirac} \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\sigma_{i=x,y}$ is the Pauli matrices, and $\\Phi$ is an $s$-wave\ngap function.\nNote that the diagonal term is not the Hamiltonian for ordinary electrons \nbut that for Dirac fermions.\n\nNow we will show that there exists a Majorana zero mode in a vortex of\nthis system. \nWhen the system support a vortex, $\\Phi$ in Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdGDirac}) becomes\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Phi=\\Phi(r)e^{i\\theta},\n\\quad\n\\Phi(\\infty)=\\Phi_0, \n\\end{eqnarray} \nwhere $r$ is the distance from the vortex, and $\\theta$ is the angle\naround the vortex.\nThe BdG Hamiltonian for the zero mode\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-i\\sigma_i\\partial_i & \\Phi(r)^{-i\\theta}\\\\\n\\Phi(r)e^{i\\theta} & i\\sigma_i\\partial_i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n{\\bm u} \\\\\n{\\bm v}\n\\end{array}\n\\right) =0 \n\\end{eqnarray}\nis easily solved and the solution is\\cite{jackiw-rossi,callan-harvey} \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\bm u}\n=N\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\ni^{1/2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\exp\\left[-\\int_0^r dr'\\Phi(r')\n\\right],\n\\quad \n{\\bm v}=i\\sigma_y{\\bm u}^{*}. \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe quantum operator $\\gamma$ for this solution in the mode expansion\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Psi'({\\bm x})=\\sqrt{2}\\gamma \n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n{\\bm u} \\\\\n{\\bm v}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)+\\cdots \n\\end{eqnarray}\ndefines the Majorana operator with $\\gamma^{\\dagger}=\\gamma$ and\n$\\gamma^2=1$.\nAs a result, vortices in this system obey the non-Abelian anyon statistics.\n\nA challenge of this idea is how to realize\nDirac fermions in condensed matter systems:\n\n\nIn general, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem tells us that such a single species\nof 2D Dirac fermions is impossible to exist in bulk periodic systems\nlike solid states.\\cite{nielsen-ninomiya}\nIndeed, no condensed matter realization of a single Dirac fermion had\nbeen known in 2003.\nTo avoid this difficulty, an application to high energy physics was\ndiscussed in Ref.\\citen{sato}.\nIn 2007, however, it was discovered that such a 2D Dirac fermion may exist\nas a surface state of topological insulators.\nBecause the surface state is not a real 2D state but spreads to\nthe bulk as well, it can be escaped \nfrom the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. \nThus, if one puts an $s$-wave superconductor on the top of\na topological insulator, one can realize the Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:BdGDirac}), as Fu and Kane discussed in Ref.\\citen{fu-kane}. \nIn the interface between an $s$-wave superconductor and a topological insulator, the chemical potential is not zero, and thus the BdG\nHamiltonian is slightly modified as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal H}=\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-i\\sigma_i\\partial_i-\\mu & \\Phi^* \\\\\n\\Phi & i\\sigma_i\\partial_i+\\mu\n\\end{array}\n\\right). \n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe chemical potential, however, does not affect on the existence of\nthe Majorana zero mode.  \nThe zero mode in the presence of the chemical potential is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\bm u}&=&N i^{3/2}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\ne^{-i\\theta} J_1(\\mu r)\\\\\ni^{-1}J_0(\\mu r)\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\exp\\left[-\\int_0^r dr'\\Phi(r')\\right],\n\\nonumber\\\\\n{\\bm v}&=&i\\sigma_y {\\bm u}^* ,\n\\end{eqnarray}  \nwith the Bessel function $J_n(x)$.\\cite{fukui-fujiwara}\n\n\n\\subsection{System with Rashba spin-orbit interaction}\n\\label{sec:system_rashba}\n\n\n\nUp to this time, unusual systems like\nchiral $p$-wave superconductors or superconducting Dirac fermions are\nneeded to realize non-Abelian anyons.\nIf we take into account the spin-orbit interaction, however, we may realize\nMajorana fermions and non-Abelian anyons even for ordinary electron\nsystems with an $s$-wave\npairing.\\cite{fujimoto,sato-takahashi-fujimoto1,sato-takahashi-fujimoto2,sau,alicea} \nBelow, we explain this realization scheme, following\nRef.\\citen{sato-takahashi-fujimoto1},\nwhich provides a compete topological analysis and establishes this scheme\nfor the first time.\n\nThe model BdG

(\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}).\nThis means that it is difficult for usual bulk $s$-wave superconductors\nto meet this condition: \nIn general, such a strong magnetic field may\ndestroy $s$-wave Cooper pairs by the Pauli depairing effect or the orbital\ndepairing effect.  \nIn the present case, the Pauli depairing can be avoided\nbecause the Fermi surface is split by the Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction so the Zeeman splitting is strongly suppressed when the Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction is strong enough.\\cite{fujimoto1}\nOn the other hand, the orbital depairing effect cannot be avoided for\nusual bulk superconductors.\n\n\nIt has been know that, however, this difficulty can be solved in\nvarious ways:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item If one consider $s$-wave superfluids of cold atoms,\n       instead of superconductors, one can avoid this\n       problem.\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto1,Zhang-Sarma} \nThis is because Cooper pairs in superfluids are charge neutral so no Lorentz\n       force for the orbital depairing does not arise.\nThe spin-orbit interaction in cold atoms can be created\n       artificially by using a sophisticated laser technique.\\cite{spielman}\n\n\\item A superconducting state of heavy fermions also may not suffer this\n      problem.\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto2}\nBecause the effective mass of heavy fermions can be about a hundred times the\n      electron mass in the vacuum,\n      the Lorentz force is strongly suppressed so the orbital depairing\n      effect does not work. In particular, heavy fermion noncentrosymmetric\n      superconductors have the Rashba spin-orbit interaction at the same\n      time.\n\\item A widely adapted solution is to use proximity induced\n      superconductivity, instead of bulk superconductivity. By putting\n      a semiconductor on the top of an $s$-wave superconductor, $s$-wave\n      superconductivity can be induced in the semiconductor.\\cite{fujimoto,sau,alicea}\nThe Zeeman field in the semiconductor can be\n      given in two different manners. \nThe first one is to consider a heterostructure illustrated in\n      Fig.\\ref{fig:JDSau}.\n\n\n\nIn this case, the electron energy in the semiconductor is\n      Zeeman-split by proximity effects of the exchange interaction\n      of the attached magnet.\n\nSince no direct magnetic field is applied,\n      no Lorentz force for the orbital depairing is induced.\nThe other way is to apply in-plane Zeeman fields, instead of Zeeman\n      fields in the $z$-direction.\\cite{alicea}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the two-dimensional system, the motion of Cooper pairs in the perpendicular direction\n      is severely restricted, so the orbital depairing becomes ineffective if\n      one applies Zeeman fields in the parallel direction.\nIn both cases, the topological superconductivity in a\n      semiconductor with small $\\varepsilon({\\bm 0})$ is considered in\n      order to met the condition (\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}) easily.\nNote that the heterostructure breaks the inversion symmetry so it\n      naturally induces the Rashba spin-orbit interactions.\n\nThe last idea was generalized to one-dimensional\nnanowires on the top of an $s$-wave superconductor.\\cite{lutchyn,oreg} \nThe Hamiltonian of this system is the same as  Eq.(\\ref{eq:BdGRashba}) with $k_y=0$, \nand Majorana zero modes appear at the ends of the nanowires when the\nsame condition (\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}) is met. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\nIn these systems, one can control the topological superconductivity by\nchanging model parameters such as $\\varepsilon({\\bm 0})$\n(namely, the chemical potential) and $H_z$.\nActually, the quantum operation by controlling the topological\nsuperconductivity was proposed in Ref.\\citen{alicea2}.  \n\nSo far, we have considered $s$-wave pairing as the\nsuperconducting gap $\\Delta$. We should note that, however, Majorana\nfermions may appear even for other unconventional pairings.\nIndeed, the details of the gap function does not matter for the argument\nusing the dual Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:dualHamiltonian}) since the \nspin-triplet gap function is induced in the dual Hamiltonian even for\nunconventional pairing. The only difference is that because the gap\nfunction vanishes at ${\\bm k}={\\bm 0}$ for many unconventional pairings,   \nthe condition (\\ref{eq:Hzcondition}) can change like\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n(\\mu_{\\rm B}H_z)^2>\\varepsilon({\\bm 0}). \n\\end{eqnarray} \nTherefore, for systems with small $\\varepsilon({\\bm 0})$, one can\nrealize Majorana fermions even for weak Zeeman fields that do not cause\nthe orbital depairing. \nMajorana fermions in $p$-wave superconductors and $d$-wave\nsuperconductors were discussed in\nRefs.\\citen{sato-fujimoto1, potter}, and\nRefs.\\citen{linder,sato-takahashi-fujimoto2, sato-fujimoto2,law1},\nrespectively.   \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=4.5cm]{hetero.eps}\n\\caption{Realization of the Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:BdGRashba}) in a\n heterostrucutre.

From a different point of view,\nthe Majorana zero mode found in this scenario can be associated with the Shiba state which is\nthe bound state formed around a magnetic impurity in a superconductor.\\cite{shiba}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Candidate Materials}\n\\label{sec:materials}\n\nThere are several compounds for candidates of topological superconductors.\nOne of promising materials for time-reversal symmetry broken topological superconductors in class D is Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ which is a candidate of a quasi-two dimensional chiral $p+ip$ superconductor.\\cite{maeno1}\nA representative candidate for time-reversal symmetric topological superconductors in class DIII in three dimensions\nis  Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which is a carrier-doped topological insulator, and is expected to realize\nan odd-parity pairing\nstate.\\cite{CuBiSe1,CuBiSe2,CuBiSe3,CuBiSe4,CuBiSe5,hao-lee,CuBiSe6,yamakage,CuBiSe7,yamakage1,\nhashimoto1,nagai,takami,mizushima,hashimoto2, nematic,matano}\nSince there are already several nice reviews on these materials,\n\\cite{maeno1,maeno2,ando,sasaki-mizushima} we will not discuss them here.\nInstead, we discuss some other possible candidate materials in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Proximity-induced superconductivity in nanowire:\n\n Time-reversal-symmetry-broken (TRSB) superconductor in class D}\n\\label{sec:nanowire}\n\nIn 2012, three experimental research groups independently reported the observation of zero-bias conductance peak in nanowire-superconductor systems,\nwhich may be associated with Majorana zero energy modes at open ends of the nanowire.\\cite{mourik,das,deng}\nIn such nanowire systems, a class D topological superconducting state which harbors Majorana zero-energy states at its open ends realizes for $E_z>\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+\\mu^2} $,\nwhere $E_z$ is the Zeeman energy, $\\Delta$ is the proximity-induced s-wave superconducting gap, and \n$\\mu$ is a chemical potential in the nanowire.\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto1,sau,lutchyn,oreg} \n\n\n\n\n\nThese groups used InSb and InAs for the nanowire, as proposed in refs.\\cite{lutchyn,oreg}.\nZero-bias conductance peak appears when the Zeeman energy $E_Z$ satisfies the above condition, which strongly suggests\nthe realization of Majorana end states.\nAccording to previous theoretical studies,\\cite{sato-takahashi-fujimoto1} \nthe topological phase transition occurs at $E_z=\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+\\mu^2}$, and the bulk energy gap closes at this critical value of $E_z$.\nHowever, in the experimental data of these conductance measurements, gap-closing behaviors were not clearly observed. \nIt was argued by Stanescu et al.\\cite{stanes} that the absence of clear gap-closing behaviors is due to dominant contributions from non-topological\nsuperconducting bands which stem from multi-band character of the nanowires, and do not exhibit gap-closing at $E_z=\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+\\mu^2}$.\nNevertheless, as discussed by several theoretical studies,\\cite{stanes,liu-potter,rainis} \nthe interpretation of these experimental observations is still intricate, and \nit has not yet been established whether the observed zero-bias peaks correspond to signature of Majorana fermions or not.\nFor instance, Liu et al.\\cite{liu-potter} and Rainis et al.\\cite{rainis} argued that disorder effects give rise to low-energy peak of conductance which is due to sub-gap states originating from trivial bands, even in trivial superconducting states.\nWe need further experimental and theoretical investigations to establish the existence of Majorana zero modes in nanowire superconducting systems\nwith strong spin-orbit interactions.\n\n\n\\subsection{Li$_2$Pt$_3$B: time reversal symmetric (TRS) superconductor in class DIII}\n\nIt is expected that the noncentrosymmetric superconductor Li$_2$Pt$_3$B, which has the cubic crystal structure $P4_332$ and $T_c\\sim 2.7$ K,\nmay realize TRS topological superconductor similar to the B phase of the superfluid Helium 3.\nIt is known that the B phase of the superfluid $^3$He is a typical example of TRS topological superfluidity in class DIII.\nThe $\\bm{d}$-vector of this spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing state which characterizes\nthe nontrivial topology is given by $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{k}$ with $\\bm{k}$ a wave number.  \nSince the crystal structure of Li$_2$Pt$_3$B breaks inversion symmetry, the pairing state can not be classified by the parity of Cooper pairs.\nHowever, if the spin-triplet pair component dominates over the spin-singlet component, the system can be a TRS topological superconductor. \nThe NMR measurement for this material suggests the existence of the dominant spin-triplet component.\\cite{zheng}\nFurthermore, the form of the $\\bm{d}$-vector is constrained by the anti-symmetric spin-orbit interaction, the form of which is\n$\\sim \\lambda_{\\rm SO}\\bm{\\sigma}\\cdot\\bm{k}$, respecting the symmetry $P4_332$.\nThis spin-orbit interaction stabilizes the $\\bm{d}$-vector similar to that of the B phase of $^3$He.\nUnfortunately, single crystals of this material have not been synthesized so far, and thus topological properties of Li$_2$Pt$_3$B\nhave not yet been clarified.\n\n\\subsection{In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te: TRS superconductor in class DIII or topological crystalline superconductor}\n\nThere have been extensive studies on crystalline topological insulators (CTI) which are protected by crystalline symmetry in addition to time-reversal symmetry.\\cite{CTI-fu}\nA promising material is the semiconductor SnTe, for which surface Dirac cone bands protected by mirror symmetry\nare observed via ARPES measurements.\\cite{SnTe-ando} \nThe partial substitution of Sn with In induces carrier-doping, rendering the system metallic. \nThe doped CTI In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te exhibits superconductivity with $T_c\\sim 1$ K.\nRemarkably, the zero energy bias peak of the conductance was observed for $x=0.045$, which implies the topological superconducting state\nwith surface zero energy Majorana modes.\\cite{InSnTe}\nThe possible pairing state may be deduced by the group theoretical\nargument.\\cite{InSnTe}\nCorresponding surface states have been investigated\ntheoretically.\\cite{hashimoto}\nThe fermi surfaces of In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te are located around $L$ points in the fcc Brillouin zone.\nIn the vicinity of the $L$ point, the band has $D_{3d}$ point group symmetry, which imposes the constraint on pairing symmetry.\nThere are two possible odd-parity pairing state allowing the Majorana surface states; i.e. $A_{1u}$ and $A_{2u}$.\nThe $A_1u$ state has full energy gap, and thus, it is a TRS topological superconducting state in class DIII.\nOn the other hand, the $A_{2u}$ state has gap-node, and the bulk topological invariant can not be defined.\nHowever, in this gapless superconducting state, a weak topological invariant can be defined in two-dimensional plane crossing\nfully gapped region of the fermi surfaces. Thus, this state is a weak topological superconductor.\n\nFor larger $x$, the superconducting state of In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te is changed to a conventional one, which may be an $s$-wave pairing state.\\cite{InSnTe2,InSnTe3}\nIf the surface Dirac bands protected by mirror symmetry still exist for this case, a vortex in the superconducting state can possess\nthe Majorana zero energy bound state at the intersection between the vortex core and the surface of the system.\\cite{jackiw-rossi}\nAn interesting feature of these Majorana modes is that they are protected by magnetic group symmetry: \nthe symmetry of the system under the combination of time-reversal symmetry operation and mirror reflection \nresults in the enhancement of topological protection of the Majorana zero modes.\\cite{fang}\nAccording to the $K$-theory argument, zero modes in a vortex of two-dimensional superconductor in class D are classified as $Z_2$, which is protected\nby the particle-hole symmetry as discussed in sec. \\ref{subsec:topodefect}.\nThus, multiple Majorana zero modes in the vortex core are not stable, and\nthere is only one topologically protected Majorana bound state.\nHowever, a vortex penetrating the surface of In$_x$Sn$_{1-x}$Te also has the above-mentioned magnetic group symmetry when the vortex line\nis parallel to the mirror plane of the system, the existence of which guarantees the topological protection of the surface Dirac cone.\nThen, the mirror Chern number on this mirror plane leads to $Z$ classification of the vortex core zero-energy bound states.\nThe existence of multiple Majorana zero-energy modes are allowed in this case.\nThis state is regarded as a topological crystalline superconducting vortex state.\n\n\n\\subsection{URu$_2$Si$_2$: Weyl superconductor}\n\nThe heavy fermion system URu$_2$Si$_2$ exhibits the superconducting\ntransition at $T_c=1.45$ K. \nAccording to thermal transport measurements which detect nodal structure of the gap function, a possible pairing state consistent with\nthe space group symmetry is the spin-singlet $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ pairing state.\\cite{URu2Si2-1} \nThe gap function of this state for small $|\\bm{k}|$ is proportional to\n$k_z(k_x+ik_y)$, which is regarded as the $p+ip$-wave symmetry multiplied with the $k_z$ factor.\nThis pairing state breaks time-reversal symmetry in the orbital degrees of freedom, and thus this material\nis a promising candidate of three-dimensional chiral superconductor.\nThe gap function has point nodes for $k_x=k_y=0$ at the north and south poles of the Fermi surface, for which $k_z=k_0$ and $k_z=-k_0$,\nrespectively. Here $\\pm k_0$ is the Fermi momentum at the $\\bm{k}$-points with $k_x=k_y=0$, and for simplicity, we assume a nearly spherical Fermi surface centered\naround the $\\Gamma$ point.\nThese points nodes are Weyl points, which possess monopole charge in the momentum space, and\nthus this system is a Weyl\nsuperconductor.\\cite{sumiyoshi-berry-phase,URu2Si2-2,gos, goswami, kobayashi}\nBasic properties of Weyl superconductors are reviewed in section \\ref{sec:weyl}.\nFor $-k_0< k_z <0$ and $0<k_z<k_0$, the spin-singlet $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ pairing state has \nthe nonzero Chern number $C$ on the $xy$-plane for fixed value of $k_z$, which is equal to $2$. Here the factor $2$ is due to spin degeneracy.\nOn the other hand, $C=0$ for $|k_z|>k_0$. This implies that the point-nodes of the gap function possesses the monopole charge $\\pm 2$ \nin the momentum space.\nThus, the situation is similar to Weyl semimetals for which the Chern number on the two-dimensional $\\bm{k}$-plane between two Weyl points is nonzero.\nFor Weyl superconductors, it is expected that anomalous thermal Hall effect occurs because of the nonzero Chern number, as discussed in sec.\\ref{sec:thermal}. See section \\ref{sec:weyl} for details.\n\nThe spin-singlet $d_{xz}+id_{yz}$ pairing state hosts a line in the\n$k_z=0$ plane, and correspondingly, it has a surface zero energy flat\nband on the $(001)$ surface.\\cite{gos, goswami, kobayashi}\nHowever, its associated topological invariant is an accidental chiral\nsymmetry, and the surface flat band is fragile against the surface\nmis-orientation.\\cite{kobayashi} On other surfaces, there exit\ntopological surface arc associated with the coexistence of line and\npoint nodes.\\cite{kobayashi}\n\nTime-reversal symmetry breaking of the chiral pairing state of URu$_2$Si$_2$ was recently examined by the measurement of the Kerr effect.\\cite{kapi} \nFurthermore, the recent measurement of the Nernst effect strongly supports the chiral pairing state of this Material.\\cite{URu2Si2-2,sumiyoshi-berry-phase}\nThe Nernst effect is a transverse thermoelectric  responses akin to the Hall effect, and a good probe for superconducting fluctuations. \nColossal Nernst signal was observed for URu$_2$Si$_2$ just above the transition temperature $T_c$.\\cite{URu2Si2-2} Surprisingly, this signal becomes larger for cleaner samples, which is not consistent with\nthe prediction of conventional theories of superconducting fluctuations. Also, the strong enhancement of the Nernst signal appears in the temperature region where the vortex liquid state is not realized. Thus, the dependence on the purity of samples is not due to pinning effect of vortices.\nThis remarkable experimental result is understood by considering the chiral character of Cooper pair \nfluctuations.\\cite{sumiyoshi-berry-phase}\nChiral superconducting fluctuations give rise to asymmetric skew-scattering of electrons, leading\nto the giant Nernst effect, which is akin to the anomalous Hall effect.\nThis scenario successfully explains the above-mentioned experimental observation, confirming \nthe realization of chiral Cooper pairs in URu$_2$Si$_2$.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{UPt$_3$: crystalline topological superconductor or Weyl superconductor}\n\n\nUPt$_3$ is a heavy fermion superconductor with $T_c\\sim 0.5 $ K.\nThe NMR measurement supports that a spin-triplet pairing state is realized in this system.\\cite{toh}\nUnder applied magnetic fields, three different superconducting phases appear.\nThe pairing symmetries of these phases are still controversial.\nHowever, recent experimental studies strongly suggest that there are two promising candidates for the pairing state\nin the low temperature and low field region, which is so-called the B phase.\\cite{izawa,kerr}\nOne is expressed in terms of the $E_{1u}$ representation of the space group symmetry of this compound\\cite{izawa} and the other one is the $E_{2u}$ representation.\\cite{kerr}\nAlso, even within the $E_{1u}$ representation, there are two possible pairing states; \nthe $E_{1u}$ planar $f$-wave state and the $E_{1u}$ chiral $f$-wave states.\\cite{izawa2}\nThe $E_{1u}$ planar pairing state is characterized by the $\\bm{d}$ vector of the form\n$\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\lambda_a\\bm{b}+\\lambda_b\\bm{c}$ where\n$\\bm{b}$ and $\\bm{c}$ are the lattice vectors of the hexagonal lattice of UPt$_3$, and\n$\\lambda_{a(b)}=k_{a(b)}(5k_c^2-k^2)$ with $a$, $b$, and $c$ the axes of the hexagonal lattice.\nAlso, for higher magnetic fields parallel to the $c$-axis, the $\\bm{d}$ rotates, and changes\nto $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\lambda_a\\bm{b}+\\lambda_b\\bm{a}$ within the $B$ phase.\nOn the other hand, the $E_{1u}$ chiral pairing state and the $E_{2u}$ pairing state break time-reversal symmetry, \nand their $\\bm{d}$ vectors are, respectively, given by\n$\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b) (5k_c^2-k^2)$, \n\nand $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b)^2k_c$.\n\n\n\nWe, first, consider the $E_{1u}$ planar $f$-wave state.\nThe gap function of this state has line and points nodes which give rise to gapless excitations, and thus, it is not a bulk topological superconducting state in the usual sense. However, as elucidated by Tsutsumi et al.\\cite{tsutsumi}, \nfor fixed $k_b=0$,\nthe $E_{1u}$ pairing state has chiral symmetry $\\Gamma$ defined by the product of time reversal symmetry operation $\\mathcal{T}$,\nparticle-hole symmetry operation $\\mathcal{C}$, and mirror symmetry operation with respect to $ac$-plane $\\mathcal{M}_{ac}$: i.e. $\\Gamma=\\mathcal{T}\\mathcal{C}\\mathcal{M}_{ac}$ and the BdG Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}(\\bm{k})$ satisfies\n$\\{\\Gamma,\\mathcal{H}(\\bm{k})\\}=0$ for $k_b=0$.\nThen, using this chiral symmetry, we can define a one-dimensional winding number $w(k_c)$ for $k_b=0$\nwhich characterize the $Z$ non-triviality. For the $E_{1u}$ state, we have $w(k_c)=\\pm 2$ for $k_c\\leq k_F$, and zero\nfor other $k_c$.\nThat is, Majorana modes appear on a surface normal to the $a$-axis, with the energy dispersion $\\sim \\pm vk_b$.\nThese surface Majorana modes is protected by the combination of time reversal symmetry,\nparticle-hole symmetry, and mirror symmetry, and thus it is a crystalline topological superconducting state.\n\nOn the other hand, the $E_{1u}$ and $E_{2u}$ chiral pairing states\n\n\nbreak time-reversal symmetry.\nSince there are point nodes of the gap at $k_a=k_b=0$, and the Fermi surface of UPt$_3$ is three dimensional,\\cite{upt3-fermi} a single-particle excitation from these point nodes behaves as a Weyl fermion, as in the case of URu$_2$Si$_2$.\nThe point node of the $E_{1u}$ chiral state, $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b) (5k_c^2-k^2)$, has the monopole charge $q_m=\\pm 1$, while the $E_{2u}$ state, $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b)^2k_c$, has $qm=\\pm 2$.\nThen, the Chern number on the $k_a-k_b$ plane for fixed $k_c$ between the two point nodes of the $E_{1u(2u)}$ chiral state\nis equal to $2$ ($4$).

Because of the nonzero Chern number, \nthere are Majorana arcs on the surface Brillouin zone for surfaces parallel to the $c$-axis.\nAs in the case of URu$_2$Si$_2$, the anomalous thermal Hall effect, the Kerr effect, and the Nernst effect due to chirality fluctuation are expected to occur.\n\nFor the $E_{2u}$ state, there exists a line node on the $k_c$ plane,\nwhich may result in a surface flat band in the $(001)$ surface.\nA line node in an odd parity superconductor is, however, topologically\nunstable.\\cite{kobayashi-shiozaki}\nCorrespondingly, the surface flat band on the (001) surface is fragile\nagainst the surface mis-orientation and the surface Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction.\\cite{kobayashi}  \n\n\\subsection{Cd$_3$As$_2$: Superconducting Dirac semimetal}\nDirac semimetals are three dimensional materials\nthat possess gapless Dirac points in the bulk Brillouin\nzone, whose low-energy excitations are effectively\ndescribed as Dirac fermions.\nCd$_3$As$_2$ is one of recently discovered Dirac\nsemimetals,\\cite{cd3as21, cd3as22, cd3as23, cd3as24, cd3as25, cd3as26,\ncd3as27, cd3as28} \nin which a superconducting phase transition has been\nreported.\\cite{supercd3as21, supercd3as22, supercd3as23}\nBecause of a zero bias conductance peak in the tunneling\nconductance\\cite{supercd3as22} topological\nsuperconductivity has been expected.\nActually a recent theoretical analysis indicates that unique orbital\ntexture of Dirac points favors topological superconductivity with a\nquartet of surface Majorana fermions.\\cite{kobayashi-sato}\n\n\\section{Non-Abelian statistics}\n\\label{sec:non-abelian}\n\n\\subsection{Exchange operation of Majorana zero-energy modes}\n\\label{sec:exch}\n\nOne of the most intriguing and remarkable features of Majorana zero-energy modes in superconductors is that they obey non-Abelian statistics, which is drastically different from Fermi statistics and Bose statistics.\\cite{moore-read,nayak-wilczek,read-green,ivanov}\nThis novel quantum statistics is a variant of anyon statistics which is realized in fractional quantum Hall effect states, and\nbasically realized in two-dimensional (2D) systems.\nHowever, we note that it is also possible to generalize the non-Abelian statistics to three dimensions, which will be discussed in the next subsections.\nAs is well-known, the conventional quantum statistics is characterized by change of a $U(1)$ phase of a many-body wave function raised \nby exchange of identical particles,\nand hence the many-body state does not depend on the order of the exchange processes.\nIn other words, the exchange operations constitute an Abelian group.\nIn contrast, for the non-Abelian statistics, exchange operations of particles is non-commutative, i.e.\ndifferent order of exchange operations of particles leads to different many-body states.\nAs a matter of fact, the particle-exchange operations (or more precisely, braiding operations\\cite{com1}) \nare described by non-Abelian unitary operators which act on the (topological) ground state space.\nOriginally, it was discussed by Read, Green, and Ivanov that a vortex with a Majorana zero mode in its core obeys\nthe non-Abelian statistics.\\cite{read-green,ivanov} \nHowever, we would like to stress that the non-Abelian statistics is a more general property of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors,\nirrespective of whether they realize in vortex cores or at open boundary edges of a sample.\n\nTo be concrete, let us consider $N$ Majorana zero-energy modes located at the spatial positions denoted by $1$, $2$, $3$, ... , $N$ in a topological superconductor, whose fields are, respectively, give by\n$\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, ...,  $\\gamma_N$.\nHere, all Majorana fields satisfy,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i^2&=&1, \\\\\n\\gamma_i\\gamma_j&=& -\\gamma_j\\gamma_i \\quad\\mbox{for} \\quad i\\neq j.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nA key factor of the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana modes is the following rule for the exchange (braiding) of any pairs of two Majorana fields, $\\gamma_i$\nand $\\gamma_j$.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i\\rightarrow\\gamma_j, \\quad \\gamma_j\\rightarrow -\\gamma_i.\n\\label{eq:rule1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe will see in the next subsection that the exchange (braiding) rule (\\ref{eq:rule1}) gives rise to the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero-energy modes.\nNote that in Eq. (\\ref{eq:rule1}) one Majorana field changes its sign, while the other does not.\nThis peculiar behavior is often understood as an effect of phase-winding of a vortex where a Majorana fermion exists: i.e.\nvortices with Majorana modes accompany branch cut at which the phase jumps by $2\\pi$, and thus, the braiding of two vortices lead\nto phase change $\\pi$ of one of the Majorana fields when the Majorana fermion traverses the branch cut.\\cite{ivanov,stone-chung}\nHowever, as mentioned before, the non-Abelian statistics realizes even for Majorana edge states in a nanowire, \nand Eq.(\\ref{eq:rule1}) holds also in such cases without vortices.\\cite{clarke,halperin-alicea}\nTo see this, let us consider the braiding of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ more precisely.\nTo proceed the argument, we assume that the topological ground state is separated from the first excited state by a finite energy gap,\nand the exchange is carried out adiabatically within this ground state manifold. Then, the Majorana zero modes are\nstill Majorana zero modes after the exchange operation. This exchange operation is described by a unitary operator $U_{1,2}$.\nWe recall that all Majorana fields are expressed by linear combinations of fields of electrons with coefficients given by\nthe wave function of the BdG Hamiltonian.\nThus, according to the adiabatic theorem, after the braiding operation, $\\gamma_{1(2)}$ is moved to $\\gamma_{2(1)}$ with an additional phase factor \ndenoted by $s_{2(1)}$.\nThen, we obtain,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\ns_2\\gamma_2=U_{1,2}\\gamma_1U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}, \\quad \ns_1\\gamma_1=U_{1,2}\\gamma_2U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}.\n\\label{eq:u12}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince $s_1^2\\gamma_1^2=1$, and $\\gamma_1^2=1$, we have $s_1=1$ or  $-1$. Similarly, $s_2=1$ or  $-1$.\nCombining the Majorana zero modes $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, we can construct a complex fermion field \n$\\psi_{12}=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$.\nThe occupation number of the complex fermion $n_{12}=\\psi^{\\dagger}_{12}\\psi_{12}$ is $1$ or $0$.\nThus, the state that consists of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ only is doubly-degenerate.\nMore generally, if $N=2m$ with $m$ an integer, we can construct $m$ complex fermion fields from $2m$ Majorana fields,\nand each complex fermion state is occupied or un-occupied, which leads to the total degeneracy $2^m$. \nThis is so-called topological degeneracy.\nWe note that this degeneracy can not be lifted by local perturbations as long as the system is isolated. This property is important\nin connection with the application to topological quantum computation, which we will mention later.\nSince Majorana fields are given by the superposition of original electron fields, \nthe total number of the complex fermions is nothing but the number of quasiparticles\nwhich arises from breaking up Cooper pairs in a superconductor. \nThis implies that the parity of the total occupation number must be preserved for an isolated system, since  destruction or creation of a Cooper pair changes\nthe number of quasiparticles only by $2$.\nHence, the degeneracy is reduced to $2^{m-1}$ for each parity sector.\nKeeping this in mind, now, we consider how the occupation number,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nn_{12}=\\psi^{\\dagger}_{12}\\psi_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}(1+i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2),\n\\label{eq:n12}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nis affected by the exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$. Operating $U_{1,2}$ on $n_{12}$, we obtain,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{1,2}n_{12}U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{i}{2}U_{1,2}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{i}{2}s_1s_2\\gamma_1\\gamma_2.\n\\label{eq:un12}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, we used Eq.(\\ref{eq:u12}).\nIn the case of $N=2$, i.e. there are only two Majorana zero modes $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, the parity of the occupation number $n_{12}$ must not be changed by the exchange operation. Then, we have $s_1s_2=-1$. On the other hand, in the case of $N>2$, it is not so trivial whether the parity of $n_{12}$\nis changed or not by $U_{12}$. However, if each Majorana zero modes are spatially well separated, \nthe exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ can not affect the occupation numbers of complex fermion states composed of the other\nMajorana zero modes, i.e.\n$n_{ij}=\\psi_{ij}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{ij}$ with $\\psi_{ij}=(\\gamma_i+i\\gamma_j)/2$ for $i$, $j=3,4,5, ..., N$, and $i\\neq j$.\n\nOtherwise, the exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ can affect fermion states infinitely far away from them ! \nThus, $n_{12}=U_{1,2}^{\\dagger}n_{12}U_{1,2}$ holds, and we obtain $s_1s_2=-1$.\nThis leads to the rule (\\ref{eq:rule1}). Depending on the gauge choice and the choice of the left-handed or right-handed rotation, \nwe have $s_1=1$, $s_2=-1$, or $s_1=-1$, $s_2=1$.\n Note that in the above argument, the presence or absence of vortices does not play any role, and hence\n Eq.(\\ref{eq:rule1}) holds for any Majorana zero modes realized in topological superconductors.\\cite{clarke,halperin-alicea}\n \n The unitary operator $U_{i,j}$ for the exchange operation of $\\gamma_i$ and $\\gamma_j$ can be conveniently \n expressed as,\\cite{ivanov}\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n U_{i,j}=\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_i\\gamma_j\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1-\\gamma_i\\gamma_j).\n \\label{eq:uij}\n \\end{eqnarray} \n It is easy to verify that Eq. (\\ref{eq:uij}) leads to the following exchange rule.\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_j=U_{i,j}\\gamma_iU_{i,j}^{\\dagger}, \\quad \n-\\gamma_i=U_{i,j}\\gamma_jU_{i,j}^{\\dagger}.\n\\label{eq:uij2}\n\\end{eqnarray} \n \n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{Majorana-review-fig-1.eps}\n\\caption{Moving the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_3$ around the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-abe1}\n\\end{figure} \n \n\\subsection{Non-Abelian statistics} \n\\label{sec:non-abe}\n\nAs mentioned above, the non-Abelian statistics is characterized by non-commutativity of the exchange operation of identical particles.\\cite{moore-read,ivanov,read-green}\nTo demonstrate this, we consider a simple system which consists of four Majorana fermions, $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$,\n$\\gamma_3$, and $\\gamma_4$. \nLet us see what happens when the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_3$ is moved adiabatically around the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$, and returns\nto the initial position; i.e. the trajectory encircles $\\gamma_1$, which amounts to twice exchange operation of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$.(Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe1})\n An important observation is that the Majorana fields $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, and\n$\\gamma_3$ constitute the Pauli matrices,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n-i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=\\sigma_z, \\quad -i\\gamma_2\\gamma_3=\\sigma_x, \\quad -i\\gamma_3\\gamma_1=\\sigma_y.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe can verify that $\\sigma_{x,y,z}$ defined above actually satisfy the commutation relation for the Pauli matrices,\n$[\\sigma_{\\mu}, \\sigma_{\\nu}]=2i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\sigma_{\\lambda}$ with $\\mu,\\nu,\\lambda=x,y,z$.\nIt is also noted that from eq. (\\ref{eq:n12}), the occupation number of the complex fermion $\\psi_{12}=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$ \nis expressed by the eigen value of $\\sigma_z$, i.e. $n_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\sigma_z)$.\nWe denote the state vector with the occupation number $n_{12}$ as $| n_{12} \\rangle$, which is also the eigen state of $\\sigma_z$; i.e.\n$\\sigma_z=1$ for $|0\\rangle$ and $\\sigma_z=-1$ for $|1\\rangle$. \nThen, since twice operation of exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$ is expressed as $(U_{3,1})^2=e^{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\gamma_3\\gamma_1}=-\\gamma_3\\gamma_1=-i\\sigma_y$,\nthe resulting states after the operation are\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n(U_{3,1})^2|0\\rangle =|1 \\rangle, \\quad\n(U_{3,1})^2|1\\rangle =-|0 \\rangle.\n\\label{eq:u31-2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus, this operation changes the parity of the occupation number of $\\psi_{12}$; i.e.\nan electron state $|1 \\rangle $ is transformed into a hole state $| 0\\rangle$ and vice versa. \n\nIn the next section, we will see that this property can be utilized for experimental detection of the non-Abelian statistics.\nIt is noted that, as mentioned before, the parity of the total number of quasiparticles should not change in the superconducting state.  \nIn fact, under the above operation the parity of the occupation number $n_{34}$ of $\\psi_{34}=(\\gamma_3+i\\gamma_4)/2$  \nis also changed, and the total parity change cancels. \nThe state composed of the four Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, and $\\gamma_4$ is completely specified by the occupation numbers $n_{12}$ and $n_{34}$.\nWe denote this state as $|n_{12}, n_{34}\\rangle=(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{12})^{n_{12}}(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{34})^{n_{34}}|0,0\\rangle$.\nSince the parity of $n_{12}+n_{34}$ must be preserved, there are two sets of doubly-degenerate states, i.e.\n$\\{|1, 1\\rangle,  |0, 0\\rangle \\}\n$, and\n$ \\{|1, 0\\rangle,  |0, 1\\rangle \\}\n$. \nThe exchange of any two of the four Majorana fermions operates on these doubly-degenerate states.\nFor instance, the exchange of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$ results in,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|1,1\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,1\\rangle -|0,0\\rangle), \\label{eq:exch1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|0,0\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,1\\rangle +|0,0\\rangle),\\label{eq:exch2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|1,0\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,0\\rangle -|0,1\\rangle), \\label{eq:exch3}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{3,1}|0,1\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|1,0\\rangle +|0,1\\rangle).\\label{eq:exch4}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThese transformation rules are obtained as follows.\nWe, first, note that from $\\psi_{12}|0,0\\rangle=\\psi_{34}|0,0\\rangle=0$, and $\\psi_{12}|0,1\\rangle=\\psi_{34}|1,0\\rangle=0$,\nit follows $\\gamma_1|0,0\\rangle=-i\\gamma_2|0,0\\rangle$, $\\gamma_3|0,0\\rangle=-i\\gamma_4|0,0\\rangle$, \n$\\gamma_1|01\\rangle=-i\\gamma_2|0,1\\rangle$, and $\\gamma_3|1,0\\rangle=-i\\gamma_4|1,0\\rangle$.\nThen, we have\n$|1, 1\\rangle=\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}\\psi^{\\dagger}_{34}|0,0\\rangle=\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|0,0\\rangle$,   $|0, 0\\rangle=-\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|1,1\\rangle$,\n$|1, 0\\rangle=\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}|0,0\\rangle=\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|0,1\\rangle$, and \n$|0, 1\\rangle=\\psi^{\\dagger}_{34}|0,0\\rangle=-\\gamma_1\\gamma_3|1,0\\rangle$.\nUsing these relations and eq.(\\ref{eq:uij}),\n\nwe obtain eqs.(\\ref{eq:exch1})-(\\ref{eq:exch4}).\n\nAs seen in eqs.(\\ref{eq:exch1})-(\\ref{eq:exch4}), the exchange operation $U_{31}$  is the unitary transformation in the two-dimensional degenerate spaces.\nMore generally, the exchange operations of Majorana fermions defined by (\\ref{eq:uij}) are non-Abelian unitary transformation.\nThe non-commutativity  of $U_{ij}$ can be easily verified as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{i,j}U_{j,k}-U_{j,k}U_{i,j}=-\\gamma_i\\gamma_k=i(2n_{ik}-1). \\label{eq:noncom}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince $n_{ik}=1$ or $0$, the operation of eq.(\\ref{eq:noncom})  on any states leads to a non-zero eigen value.\nThus, Majorana zero-energy states in superconductors obey the non-Abelian statistics characterized by non-commutativity of particle exchange.\n\n\nThere are several proposals on how to realize the braiding operation of Majorana fermions in real systems.\nWe will discuss some of these ideas briefly in the end of section \\ref{sec:TQC}.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\\subsection{Non-Abelian statistics in three dimensions}\n\nIn standard textbooks of quantum mechanics, it is explained that\nin three spatial dimensions, exchanging the positions of two identical point-like particles twice times results in the same state as the original one.\nIn other words, in three dimensions, the exchange of two particles is trivial, and only Bose or Fermi statistics is possible.\nHowever, as explained in the section \\ref{sec:exch}, the exchange rule (\\ref{eq:rule1}), which is the basis of the non-Abelian statistics,\nholds for Majorana zero modes in superconductors irrespective of spatial dimensions.\nIn fact, it was clarified by Teo and Kane that the non-Abelian statistics of Majorana zero modes is possible even in three-dimensional systems,\nwhen there are point-like defects with Majorana zero modes in a superconductor.\\cite{teo-kane1} \nThey demonstrated that such a defect realizes in heterostructure systems; e.g. the intersection of a vortex of the $s$-wave pairing and the interface between a topological insulator and\na trivial superconductor.  Suppose that there is a vortex line perpendicular to the interface between the superconductor and\nthe topological insulator. The vortex line is terminated at the interface, and the zero-energy Majorana mode appears at this end point of the vortex, behaving as a non-Abelian anyon.\nAn important point here is that the point defect is not really a point-like object, but spatially extended, because of the texture structure composed \nof the spatially-varying order parameter of the superconductor and the band gap which spatially varies from a negative value in the topological insulator region to a positive one in the trivial superconductor region.\nBecause of such additional degrees of freedom, the exchange of two particles can be non-trivial in contrast to conventional quantum statistics.\nIt was also elucidated by Freedman et al. that the non-Abelian statistics of spatially-extended defects with zero modes is associated with \nprojective ribbon permutation statistics, where a texture accompanying a zero mode is intuitively regarded as a ribbon, at the open edge of which\nthere is a localized zero mode.\\cite{freedman}\nAlso, the non-Abelian statistics in three dimensions is possible in three-dimensional network of nanowires in which Majorana zero modes appear\nat boundaries between a topological sector and a trivial sector. \n\n\n\n\\subsection{Proposal for experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics}\n\nThere are several proposals for experimental schemes of detection of non-Abelian statistics.\nA remarkable feature of non-Abelian statistics is the non-commutativity of particle exchanges.\nThus, an important issue is how one can detect the non-commutativity in experimentally observable quantities.\nMost of these proposals utilize certain kinds of interferometers, in which the exchange of Majorana fermions can be achieved when\na Majorana edge mode travels encircling a vortex Majorana zero mode inside the bulk of a superconductor.\\cite{law,akhmerov,fu-kane-majorana,butiker} (see Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe2})\nThe signature of the non-commutativity appears in transport properties of the interferometers.\nA simplest example is a class D topological superconductor attached with a single metallic lead (Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe2}).\nA more sophisticated approach proposed by Grosfeld and Stern\\cite{grosfeld} is to utilize the interplay between the Aharonov-Bohm effect and Aharonov-Casher effect.\n\n\\subsubsection{One-lead conductance measurement}\n\\label{sec:one-lead}\n\nWe consider the setup shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:non-abe2}, in which the bulk is a class D topological superconductor in two-dimensions.\\cite{law} \nFor simplicity, we assume that \nthere is only one chiral Majorana gapless mode on the one-dimensional edge of the system.\nThere is a finite tunneling amplitude between\nelectrons (or holes) in the lead  and the gapless edge state.\nThe Hamiltonian for this tunneling process with the amplitude $t$ is given by\\cite{flensberg}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_{\\rm tun}=i\\frac{t}{2}\\gamma(0)\\sum_{\\sigma}[c_{\\sigma}(0)+c_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(0)], \\label{eq:tun}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\gamma(0)$ is a Majorana field for the edge state at $\\bm{r}=0$ where the lead is attached,\nand $c_{\\sigma}(0)$, $c_{\\dagger}^{\\dagger}(0)$ are electron annihilation and creation operators with spin $\\sigma$ at the same point.\nEq.(\\ref{eq:tun}) implies that only one of real fields, $\\gamma_1$, which constitute the complex field $\\psi=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$\ncouples with the Majorana edge state, and the other one $\\gamma_2$ is decoupled.\nLet us consider the situation that there is one vortex inside the bulk superconductor which contains one Majorana zero mode.\nWe denote the Majorana field for the vortex core state as $\\gamma_3$.\nThe tunneling between the lead and the superconductor induce the injection of $\\gamma_1$ into the Majorana edge state. \nThe injected Majorana fermion travels along the circumference of the superconductor encircling the Majorana zero mode $\\gamma_3$ in the vortex core, and returns to the lead, constituting the electron (or hole) field $\\psi^{\\dagger}$ ($\\psi$) with $\\gamma_2$ again.\nIn this process, twice exchange operation of $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$ occurs, which is expressed by $(U_{31})^2$ as explained in the section \\ref{sec:non-abe}. Then, from eq.(\\ref{eq:u31-2}), the occupation number of an electron $n=\\psi^{\\dagger}\\psi$ in the lead is changed by\nthis process; i.e. the electron state in the lead is completely converted into the hole state and vice versa.\nWe can generalize this consideration to the case that there are multiple vortices inside the bulk superconductor.\nIf the number of vortices with a single Majorana zero mode in each vortex core is odd,  \nthe conversion between the electron state $|1\\rangle$ and the hole state $|0\\rangle$ occurs with probability of unity\nafter the above process.\nHence, we arrive at a remarkable consequence that the conductance for the attached lead is quantized as $2e^2/h$ when\nthe number of enclosed vortices is odd.\\cite{law}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{figure-5-2.eps}\n\\caption{Setup of an interferometer for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics.

mode $\\gamma_1$ propagates along the circumference of the disk,\nencircling the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_3$.\nThis setup realizes the braiding of the Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_3$.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-abe2}\n\\end{figure} \n\nThe quantized conductance can be derived explicitly by using scattering theory.\nWe, here, follow a sophisticated argument presented by Li, Fleury, and B\\\"uttiker.\\cite{butiker}\nFor simplicity, we consider the case that there are only one chiral Majorana zero mode on the edge of the superconductor \nand one channel of conduction electrons in the lead, and that there are also $n_v$ vortices with Majorana zero modes in the core in the bulk of the superconductor.\nHereafter, it is assumed that the vorticity of each vortex is unity.\n$n_v$ must be odd, since the total number of Majorana fermions including the edge state and the vortex core states, which emerge\nfrom splitting original electrons into two parts, should be even.\nThen, the scattering matrix for electrons and holes at the junction connects\nthe incoming state of electrons and holes $(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm in},\\psi_{\\rm in} )$ and the outgoing state of them \n$(\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm out},\\psi_{\\rm out} )$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\psi_{\\rm out} \\\\\n\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm out}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n=S\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\psi_{\\rm in} \\\\\n\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\rm in}\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere, spin indices are omitted.\nIn fact, for any realistic proposals of realizing non-Abelian statistics in\nclass D topological superconductors, \nspin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect split the Fermi surface into two parts, and only one of them is relevant\nto the topological superconducting state.\\cite{sato-fujimoto1,sato-takahashi-fujimoto1,sau,alicea} \nThus, there is only one type of fermions which is the superposition of an up-spin state and a down-spin state.\n$\\psi$ and $\\psi^{\\dagger}$ can be expressed in terms of Majorana fields $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ via,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\psi \\\\\n\\psi^{\\dagger}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n=\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & i \\\\\n1 & -i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n\\gamma_1/\\sqrt{2} \\\\\n\\gamma_2/\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus, transforming into the Majorana basis, we obtain the scattering matrix for Majorana modes,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_M=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n-i & i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)S\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & i \\\\\n1 & -i\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\label{eq:sm-s}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs mentioned above, only $\\gamma_1$ couples to the chiral Majorana edge mode, leaving $\\gamma_2$ unaffected.\nThen, $S_M$ is expressed as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nS_M=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nr_{M1} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $r_{M1}$ is the reflection amplitude for the Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$.\n$r_{M1}$ can be derived in the following manner.\nAt the junction between the lead and the superconductor, the Majorana state $\\gamma_1$ tunnels into\nthe chiral Majorana edge state $\\gamma$ with tunneling amplitude $\\sqrt{1-r_0^2}$, where\n$r_0$ is the bare reflection amplitude of $\\gamma_1$ at the junction.\nTraveling around the superconducting region, the Majorana state acquires\nthe phase change $\\theta=n_v\\pi+\\pi+kL$ with $k$ the wave number of the chiral Majorana mode, and $L$ the length of the circumference of \nthe superconductor.\nThe second term of $\\theta$, $pi$, arises from\nthe Berry phase due to the rotation of spin.\nNote that for realistic proposals mentioned before, spin-orbit interaction combined with the Zeeman effect gives rise to\nspin texture structure on the Fermi surface.\nFor instance, in the case of a superconductor with the Rashba spin-orbit interaction $\\lambda\\bm{\\sigma}\\cdot(k_y,-k_x,0)$, the direction of spin is in the $xy$-plane and perpendicular to\nthe propagating direction.\nHence, the motion of a Majorana fermion along the circumference accompanies the rotation\nof spin by $2\\pi$, resulting in the Berry phase $\\pi$.\nAfter traveling around the edge, the Majorana mode tunnels into the $\\gamma_1$ state in the lead again with probability $\\sqrt{1-r_0^2}$.\nThen,  the amplitude for this one turn process is\n$-(1-r_0^2)e^{i\\theta}$, where the total minus sign arises from backward scattering.\nIn a similar manner, the amplitude for the Majorana mode moving around the circumference of the superconductor $n$-times with successive\ntunneling into the lead is given by $-(1-r_0^2)r_0^{n-1}e^{in\\theta}$.\nThen, the total amplitude for the reflection

\\frac{1+\\cos\\theta}{1+r_0^2-2r_0\\cos\\theta},\n\\label{eq:she}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $V$ is bias-voltage applied to the lead, and $E=v_Mk$ with $v_M$ velocity of the chiral Majorana edge state. \nNote that when $n_v$ is odd and $\\theta=2\\pi\\times\\mbox{integer}$, $|s^{eh}|^2=1$ in the limit of $E\\rightarrow0$, irrespective of the value of $r_0$,\nas seen from eq.(\\ref{eq:she}).\nThus, we obtain the quantized conductance $G=dI/dV|_{V\\rightarrow 0}=2e^2/h$.\nOn the other hand, when $n_v$ is even, i.e. $\\theta=\\pi\\times\\mbox{(odd integer)}$, $|s^{eh}|^2=0$, and hence, $G=0$ irrespective of $r_0$.\nIn fact, in the case of even $n_v$, there is no chiral Majorana zero mode on the edge of the superconductor,\nbecause, as mentioned before, the total number of Majorana fermions including the edge state and the vortex core states, which emerge\nfrom splitting original electrons into two parts, must be even.\nThe vanishing zero-bias conductance $G=0$ for even $n_v$ is consistent with this physical picture.\nThe quantized conductance $G=2e^2/h$ irrespective of the coupling strength between the lead and the superconductor in the case of odd $n_v$\nis very remarkable, characterizing the non-Abelian character which leads to the perfect conversion between an electron and a hole, i.e. eq.(\\ref{eq:u31-2}).\nThe above argument can be generalized to more realistic cases with multiple conducting channels in the lead.\nIn such cases, one of Majorana fermion fields from electrons (or holes) in the lead couples to the chiral Majorana edge mode, if there is only one chiral edge mode, leading to the quantized conductance for this channel.\nHowever, because of contributions from other channels which are not involved with perfect Andreev reflection mediated via a Majorana zero mode, \nthe total conductance is not quantized generally. Thus, the observation of the non-Abelian character of Majorana fermions using the one-lead conductance measurement is rather difficult for realistic experimental setup.\nWe need more sophisticated interference experiments for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics, which will be discussed in the next \nsubsection.\n\nIt is noted that the above calculation for odd $n_v$ can be also applicable to the case of nanowire, for which a Majorana edge state is localized at\nthe junction between the normal lead and the superconducting wire.\nIn this case, $\\theta=0$, and thus we obtain the quantized conductance $G=2e^2/h$.\nHowever, underlying physics for the origin of the quantized conductance here is a bit different from that in the case of 2D systems.\nIn 2D cases considered above, the quantized conductance is a result of the braiding of Majorana fermions, featuring the non-Abelian character,\nwhile in the case of nanowires, it is due to perfect conversion of electrons and holes raised by the Andreev reflection mediated via a Majorana zero mode.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Aharonov-Bohm effect and Aharonov-Casher effet}\n\nAs seen in the previous section, the conductance does not depend on the number of vortices $n_v$ encircled by the trajectory of the propagating chiral Majorana edge mode when $n_v$ is odd.\nThis implies that in the case of odd $n_v$, there is no Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect with respect to the magnetic flux threaded in the superconductor.\nWe note that this remarkable feature is not due to charge-neutrality of Majorana fermions: in fact,\nthere is a sign change of a Majorana field, when it encircles a single vortex, as seen from the expression of a Majorana field in  terms of electron fields:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\gamma_i=\\sum_{\\sigma}\\int d\\bm{r} [u_{0\\sigma i}(\\bm{r})e^{i\\frac{\\phi}{2}}c_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(\\bm{r})+v_{0\\sigma i}(\\bm{r})e^{-i\\frac{\\phi}{2}}c_{\\sigma}(\\bm{r})],\n\\label{eq:mf-f}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nwhere $\\phi$ is the phase of the superconducting gap.\nInstead, however, the absence of the AB effect is understood as a result \nof the non-commutativity of Majorana fermions, i.e. the non-Abelian character.\\cite{stern,bonderson}\nWhen a Majorana fermion travels along the surface edge of the superconductor, the braiding of the Majorana edge mode and a Majorana bound state\nin a vortex core in the superconductor occurs, and the Majorana edge state acquires a phase. \nAnother incoming quasiparticle gives rise to another braiding. However, this does not commute with the previous one because of eq.(\\ref{eq:noncom}), and hence\nthe resulting state cannot be an eigen state of both of these two braiding operators. This results in dephasing of the interference.\nThus, the absence of the AB effect signifies the non-Abelian statistics.\nA scheme utilizing this property for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics was proposed by Grosfeld and Stern.\\cite{grosfeld}\nThey consider Josephson-coupled superconductors threaded by a magnetic flux, in which there is a Josephson vortex at the junction, and furthermore\nelectric charge $Q$ is put in a hole of the superconductor as well as the magnetic flux $\\Phi$. (see Fig.\\ref{fig:non-abe3}) \nA key idea is to use the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect associated the Josephson vortex  which carries a Majorana zero mode. \nThe AC effect is realized by changing the role of a charged particle and a magnetic flux in the AB effect; i.e. a quantum mechanical particle with a magnetic dipole moving around a charge flux (an electric field) acquires a phase due to the gauge field associated with the electric field.\nThus, the vortex current $J_v$ carried by the conventional Josephson vortex without a Majorana fermion exhibits\nthe periodic-dependence on the charge $Q$ in the hole of the system, $J_v\\sim J_{v0}+J_{v1}\\cos(2\\pi \\frac{Q}{2e})$. \nHowever, in the setup considered here, the Josephson vortex harbors a Majorana zero mode, and hence\nthe AC effect of the moving Josephson vortex disappears when the number of vortices in\nthe center hole $n_v$ is odd; i.e. there are odd number of Majorana fermions in the inner part of the junction system encircled by the trajectory of the Josephson vortex.\nThe absence of the AC effect is due to the above-mentioned mechanism of dephasing raised by non-commutativity of Majorana fermions in the Josephson vortex and in the inner part\nof the junction.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{AC-effect1-2.eps}\n\\caption{Setup for the detection of the non-Abelian statistics based on the AC effect.\nThe system consists of three part of topological superconductors, which are connected  via Josephson junction regions.\nThe Josephson vortices with Majorana zero modes can propagate along the junction, encircling \nthe charge $Q$ at the center of the system, which leads to the AC effect.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-abe3}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\n\\section{\"Fractionalization\"-- $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect}\n\\label{sec:4pi-josephson}\n\nAs seen in previous sections, a Majorana fermion field of superconductors emerges from separating the real or imaginary parts of a complex fermion field of an electron.\nIn this sense, an electron fractionalizes into two Majorana fermions.\nIt should be noted that this is not fractionalization raised by intrinsic topological order which is realized in the fractional quantum Hall effect states,\nand leads to fractionalized quasiparticles.\nIn fact, there is no intrinsic topological order in topological superconductors.\nHowever, the \"fractionalization\" into Majorana fermions gives rise to some interesting electromagnetic properties.\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena is the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson \neffect.\\cite{kitaev-majorana-chain,yakovenko,jiang}\nTo explain this, let us consider a Josephson junction system with a ring geometry shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:frac-jose}, where a magnetic flux $\\Phi$ threads the hole of the ring.\nThis is a superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction, and the phase difference between two junction separated via the small insulating region\nis $\\phi=\\frac{2e}{\\hbar}\\Phi$.\nThen, the single-electron tunneling Hamiltonian is\n$H_{1t}=-te^{i\\phi}\\psi_{\\sigma 1}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{\\sigma 2}+h.c.$, where $\\psi_{\\sigma 1}$ and $\\psi_{\\sigma 2}$ are electron fields at two junctions.\nAlso, in the case with Majorana zero-energy modes, the mode expansion of the electron fields is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\psi_{\\sigma i}=u_{\\sigma i}(x)\\gamma_i+\\mbox{(non-zero energy modes)},\n\\label{eq:psimode0}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $i=1$, $2$.\nThus, the single-electron tunneling Hamiltonian reads,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_{1t}=J_Mi\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\cos \\frac{\\phi}{2},\n\\label{eq:h1t}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $J_M$ is a real constant.\nIn addition to this, there is also a usual Josephson coupling term for Cooper pair tunneling, which is expressed as $H_{2t}=J\\cos\\phi$ with $J$\na Josephson tunneling amplitude.\nSince the system is isolated, the total charge number is conserved, and hence, it\nis an eigen state of the fermion parity (\\ref{eq:n12}); i.e. $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=1$ or $-1$.\nAs seen from (\\ref{eq:h1t}), these parity-eigen state exhibits $4\\pi$-periodicity of the Josephson current as\na function of $\\phi$. This implies that the Josephson current is not carried by Cooper pairs with charge $2e$, but rather by\nparticles with charge $e$; i.e. \"fractionalizaion\" of Cooper pairs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{frac-jose.eps}\n\\caption{(Upper panel) Setup for the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect.

This observation may be a signature of the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson effect. \nHowever, to this date, no other experimental groups have succeeded to confirm this observation.\n\n\\section{Non-local correlation of Majorana fermions and teleportation}\n\\label{sec:non-local}\n\nAs mentioned before, we can interpret the emergence of a Majorana fermion in a superconductor as splitting up a complex fermion field of an electron into real and imaginary parts. From this point of view, one may expect non-local correlation between two spatially separated Majorana fermions.\nThis is, indeed, the case for certain situations.\\cite{ bolech, tewari,semenoff,nilsson,fu-majorana}\nTo deal with this issue, we consider a simple toy model of one-dimensional topological superconductor with a Majorana zero-energy mode localized at\nthe open boundaries of the system. (See Fig.\\ref{fig:non-local})\nWe denote Majorana fields for these edge states at $x=0$ and $L$ as $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, respectively.\nFor this system, the mode expansion of an electron operator with spin $\\sigma$ at $x$, $\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)$, is given by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)=\\sum_{i=1,2} u_{\\sigma i}(x)\\gamma_i+\\mbox{(non-zero energy modes)}.\n\\label{eq:psimode}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe non-local correlation can be immediately seen from long-distance behaviors of correlation function $\\langle\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)\\psi_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(y)\\rangle$.  \nSince $u_{\\sigma 1(2)}$ is localized around $x=0$ $(L)$, and there are no low-energy excitations other than the Majorana edge states, we have, \nfor $x\\sim 0$ and $y\\sim L$,\\cite{tewari,semenoff,nilsson}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\langle\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)\\psi_{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}(y)\\rangle \\sim u_{\\sigma 1}(x)u_{\\sigma 2}^{*}(y)\\langle \\gamma_1\\gamma_2 \\rangle.\n\\label{eq:psi-cor}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs mentioned in the previous sections, the topological superconducting phase is the eigen state of the parity operator\n $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=2n-1$ with $n_{12}=\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}\\psi_{12}$,\n as long as the system is isolated.\nThus, the correlation function (\\ref{eq:psi-cor}) is non-zero even for $|x-y|\\rightarrow \\infty$, which signifies non-local correlation raised by\nthe existence of Majorana zero modes.\nThis non-local correlation affects tunneling probability of electrons mediated via Majorana zero modes in an interesting way.\nLet us consider electron tunneling from one end at $x=0$ to the other end at $x=L$.\nThe tunneling amplitude is proportional to the correlation function (\\ref{eq:psi-cor}), which is \nindependent of the distance between two edges $L$.\nThis remarkable $L$-independent behavior of the tunneling  is referred to as \"teleportation\".\nHowever, the experimental detection of this \"teleportation\" is a bit tricky issue, because of the following reason.\nTo distinguish whether an electron detected at $x=L$ comes from the opposite edge at $x=0$ via tunneling or is created from\nbreaking up a Cooper pair in the superconductor, we need to detect the parity state of $\\psi_{12}$ simultaneously.\nAlso, we note that this \"teleportation\" does not break causality, because the information of the one end state, say at $x=0$, must be transferred\nto the observer at $x=L$ in a classical way to detect the above-mentioned tunneling process.\nFurthermore, to probe the Majorana end state, one needs to couple the boundary edge with a lead which allow electrons coming in and going out, resulting\nin the failure of parity conservation.\\cite{budich}  Then, the systems is no longer the eigen state of $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2$, and the average of this operator leads\nto vanishing of correlation eq.(\\ref{eq:psi-cor}).\\cite{bolech}\nConcerning the last point, however, the situation is changed, when there is finite overlap of wave functions of two Majorana edge modes, \nand the topological degeneracy associated with the fermion number parity $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2=\\pm 1$ is lifted.\nIn this case, the value of $\\langle \\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\rangle$ is determined by the lowest one of the two state with $n_{12}=0$ and $1$.\nIf the energy splitting between these levels is sufficiently larger than typical excitation energy of electrons in the attached lead,\nthe transition between the states with $n_{12}=0$ and $1$ is suppressed, and non-local correlation eq.(\\ref{eq:psi-cor}) survives.\\cite{nilsson}\nWe note that the correlation eq.(\\ref{eq:psi-cor}) is still independent of the distance between two edges $L$, though the overlap between the two Majorana end states depends on $L$.\n\nThe non-local correlation may be detected by tunneling experiments. The Hamiltonian for tunneling processes between \nthe Majorana end state of the 1D topological superconductor and external leads is expressed by,\\cite{bolech,flensberg}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T&=&\\sum_{k,\\sigma}\\int dx[t_k(x)c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)+h.c.] \\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\\sum_{k,\\sigma}\\sum_{i=1,2}[V_{k\\sigma i}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}-V^{*}_{k\\sigma i}c_{k\\sigma}]\\gamma_i, \n\\label{eq:tun-g}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $c_{k\\sigma}$ ($c_{k\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$) is an annihilation (creation) operator for an electron in the leads, \n$V_{k\\sigma i}=\\int dx t_{k}(x)u_{\\sigma i}(x)$, and $t_k(x)$ is a tunneling amplitude.\nWe have used eq.(\\ref{eq:psimode}) to derive (\\ref{eq:tun-g}).\n$V_{k\\sigma 1}$ and  $V_{k\\sigma 2}$ are the effective tunneling amplitudes between electrons in the leads and Majorana fermions in the superconductor at $x=0$  and $x=L$, respectively. \nUsing $\\psi_{12}=(\\gamma_1+i\\gamma_2)/2$, we rewrite the above equation into the form,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T&=&\\sum_{k,\\sigma}[V_{k\\sigma}^{(-)}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}+V_{k\\sigma}^{(-)*}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}c_{k\\sigma} \\nonumber \\\\\n&&+V_{k\\sigma}^{(+)}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}+V_{k\\sigma}^{(+)*}\\psi_{12}c_{k\\sigma}],\n\\label{eq:tunneling2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere \n$V_{k\\sigma}^{(\\pm)}=V_{k\\sigma 1}\\pm i V_{k\\sigma 2}$.\nThe first line of the right-hand side of eq.(\\ref{eq:tunneling2}) corresponds to the normal tunneling processes between electrons in the leads and\nthe non-local fermion $\\psi_{12}$.\nOn the other hand, the second line of eq.(\\ref{eq:tunneling2}) expresses the Andreev scattering processes mediated via the non-local fermion. \nIn the case that the two Majorana fermions are well separated, and the the level splitting $E_M$ of the two Majorana modes induced by finite overlapping\nis  sufficiently smaller than bias voltage $V$ applied to the lead, local Andreev reflection at each junction dominates, and the non-local correlation does not\nappear.\\cite{bolech} \nIn fact, by integrating out the $\\psi_{12}$ fermion, we obtain the term of the form $(V_{k\\sigma 1}V_{-k\\sigma'1}+V_{k\\sigma 2}V_{-k\\sigma'2})c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}c^{\\dagger}_{-k\\sigma'}$ which corresponds to the local Andreev reflection, and domiantes over \nthe crossed Andreev reflection term of the form $V_{k_{\\sigma}1}V_{-k\\sigma' 2}c_{k\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger}_{-k\\sigma'}$.\nHowever, in the case of the opposite situation, i.e. $E_M \\gg V$, crossed Andreev reflection mediated via $\\psi_{12}$ occurs;\nan electron injected to one end of the superconducting wire is converted to a hole emitted from the other end, characterizing\nthe non-local correlation.\\cite{nilsson}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{non-local-majorana-1.eps}\n\\caption{1D topoogical superconductor with Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ at \nthe edges $x=0$ and $L$, respectively. Metallic leads are attached to the open edges in the lower panel.\n}\n\\label{fig:non-local}\n\\end{figure} \n\nA more remarkable non-local correlation effect appears in a mesoscopic topological superconductor in which the charging energy effect is not negligible.\nThis sophisticated idea was first proposed and examined by Fu.\\cite{fu-majorana,egger1,egger2} An important point of this idea is that \nfor sufficiently large Coulomb energy, the charge conservation yields\nthe phase fluctuation of the superconducting gap, which suppresses the local Andreev reflection mentioned above. \n\nLet us consider a 1D mesoscopic-size superconductor which is not grounded, but a capacitor is inserted between the system and the ground.\nNote that the zero energy states with $n_{12}=0$ and $n_{12}=1$ are still degenerate, \nthough the total number of Cooper pairs $_{\\rm pair}$ are constrained by the charging energy.\nThus, for sufficiently large charging energy, and with a proper bias voltage, which controls\nthe total number of electrons in the superconductor, \nthe lowest energy states are doubly degenerate corresponding to $n_{12}=0$ and $1$.\nThere are two possibility of the doubly-degenerate states; i.e.\n(i) $(N_{\\rm pair}, n_{12})=(N,0)$, and $(N,1)$, \n(ii)  $(N_{\\rm pair},n_{12})=(N-1,1)$, and $(N,0)$. \nIn the case (i), the number of Cooper pairs is not changed, while, in the case (ii), the change of $n_{12}$ \nfrom $0$ to $1$ accompanies\nbreaking of a Cooper pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo take into account the phase fluctuation explicitly, we include the phase operator $\\phi$ in the mode expansion of an electron field (\\ref{eq:psimode}),\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\psi_{\\sigma}(x)=\\sum_{i=1,2} u_{\\sigma i}(x)\\gamma_ie^{-i\\frac{\\phi}{2}}+\\mbox{(non-zero energy modes)},\n\\label{eq:psimode2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThen, for the case (i), the tunneling Hamiltonian between normal metal leads and the superconductor \nwhich couple at $x=0$ and $L$\nis,\\cite{egger1}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T=\\sum_{k,\\sigma}[V_{k\\sigma 1}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}+iV_{k\\sigma 2}^{*}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}c_{k\\sigma}+h.c.]\n\n\\label{eq:tun-tele}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nTo derive eq.(\\ref{eq:tun-tele}), we have applied a gauge transformation to $\\psi_{12}$ field.\nEq.(\\ref{eq:tun-tele}) implies that the single-electron tunneling from the terminal 1 to the terminal 2 mediated via the non-local fermion $\\psi_{12}$ occurs, in spite of the absence of single-particle excitations in the bulk of the\nsuperconductor at sufficiently low temperatures. \nRemarkably, this tunneling process is independent of the length of the superconductor.\nIt may be legitimate to call this process \"teleportation\" of single electron mediated via Majorana fermions.\nThis effect is a result of non-local correlation of Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$.\nOn the other hand, for the case (ii), we have,\\cite{egger1}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH_T=\\sum_{k,\\sigma}[V_{k\\sigma 1}c^{\\dagger}_{k\\sigma}\\psi_{12}^{\\dagger}e^{-i\\phi}+iV_{k\\sigma 2}^{*}\\psi_{12}c_{k\\sigma}e^{i\\phi}+h.c.].\n\n\\label{eq:tun2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince $e^{i\\phi}$ ($e^{-i\\phi}$) is the raising (lowering) operator for the number of Cooper pairs,\nthe first (second) term of eq.(\\ref{eq:tun2}) creates (annihilates) the $\\psi_{12}$ fermion accompanying \nbreaking (formation) of a Cooper pairs, preserving the total electron charge.\nEq.(\\ref{eq:tun2}) also induces the single-electron tunneling from the terminal 1 to the terminal 2 mediated\nvia $\\psi_{12}$, causing \"teleportation\" of electrons.\nAs a matter of fact, after integrating over $\\psi_{12}$ field in eq.(\\ref{eq:tun-tele}) or (\\ref{eq:tun2}), we obtain\nthe term of the form $V_{k\\sigma 1}V_{k'\\sigma' 2}^{*}c_{k\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{k'\\sigma'}$, and there is no\nAndreev scattering term. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above results are understood as follows.\nThe phase fluctuation suppresses the Andreev reflection mediated via Majorana bound states at open edges, \nin contrast to the case without charging energy expressed by eq.(\\ref{eq:tunneling2}). \nAs a result, only normal single-particle tunneling processes survive because of the charge conservation, leading to the tunneling between\nelectrons at two open edges mediated via the Majorana modes. \n\n\n\nWe stress that this \"teleportation\" does not break causality because of the above-mentioned reason.\nThis effect can be experimentally detected as the AB effect.\nLet us consider the setup shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:tele}, \nwhich consists of a topological superconducting wire with Majorana zero modes at boundary edges\nattached with a normal metal lead, constituting a ring geometry threaded by a magnetic flux.\nBecause of the single-electron resonant tunneling mediated via Majorana modes, at sufficiently low temperatures for which\nquantum coherence of electrons in the normal metal lead is retained, \nthe AB effect with the periodicity $2\\phi_0$ with $\\phi_0=h/2e$ appears.\nThis is remarkably contrasted with the case without Majorana zero modes, for which the AB effect is absent, since\nsingle-electron coherence is suppressed by the superconducting gap, and coherence of Cooper pairs does not survive in the normal metal lead.\n\nThe above result also implies that the charge transport of the topological superconducting nanowire\nvia the two Majorana end states leads to the quantized conductance $G=e^2/h$, which is a half of \nthe conductance in the case of the Andreev scattering mediated via the Majorana zero mode discussed in sec.\\ref{sec:one-lead}. This is due to the suppression of the Andreev scattering at the two ends as mentioned above.\nThe conductance $G=e^2/h$ also characterizes \"teleportation\" of an electron through the superconducting nanowire\nvia the Majorana end states.\\cite{fu-majorana,egger1}\n\nWe close this section by mentioning that non-local correlation also appears as entanglement of spin states of Majorana fermions.\\cite{flensberg-spin,pascal-spin}\nFor instance, for a topological superconducting wire in the class D, \nthe spin density of a Majorana end state is correlated with that at the other open end. \nThe detection of the spin correlation at two open ends may signify the existence of Majorana fermions.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{tele.eps}\n\\caption{Setup for \"teleportation\" of electrons via Majorana fermions.

From their analysis, \nthe thermal Hall conductivity for transport currents reads as\\cite{niu,cooper,streda}\n\n", "index": 5, "text":

result mentioned above up to the sign. The sign of $\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}$ is determined by the detail of the band structure, i.e. the Berry curvature.\n\nThe above result is directly applicable to real materials showing chiral superconducting state.\nFor instance. in the case of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$,  which is one of the most promising candidate of a $p+ip$ chiral superconductor,\nthere are three bands with spin degeneracy, and the Fermi surfaces of two of them have positive curvature leading to the positive Berry curvature,\nwhile the other one has the negative Berry curvature.\nThus, the total contributions to the thermal Hall conductivity is\n$\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}=\\frac{\\pi T}{12}(2+2-2)=\\frac{\\pi T}{6}\\sim 10^{-4} ~T$ (W/K$\\cdot$m).\nAlthough this magnitude is quite small, rendering its experimental detection highly challenging, we believe that it is still possible\nto observe this effect by precise measurements.\nRecently, a detailed analysis of the gap function for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ suggests\nthe existence of higher harmonics of the gap function which leads to large Chern number,\nand the thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_{xy}=\\frac{7}{12}\\pi T$.\\cite{s-simon}\n\n\\subsection{Cases of TRS topological superconductors}\n\nFor class DIII time-reversal-symmetric topological superconductors in three dimensions, \nthere are Majorana surface states, which carry heat currents. \nFor this class, \nthe bulk topological invariant is defined as a winding number which takes any integer values, as explained in section \\ref{subsec:TRS},\nand the winding number $w_{\\rm 3D}$ is precisely equal to the total number of topologically protected surface gapless  Majorana modes. \nThis topological invariant appears in thermal transport coefficient, as in the case of chiral superconductors.\nHowever, an important difference is that, in this case, one needs to break time-reversal symmetry to realize quantum thermal Hall effect\nby adding external perturbations to the system.\nPerturbations which break time-reversal symmetry (more precisely chiral symmetry, as will be elucidated later),\ninduce mass gap of the Majorana surface state, and hence, the 2D surface state exhibit the quantum thermal Hall effect,\nas in the case of 2D chiral superconductors. \nAn effective theory for the surface state is described by $M$-species of 2D free Majorana fermions with mass gaps $m_i$ ($i=1, 2,..., M$).\nWe can apply the formula (\\ref{thermalHall}) to these Majorana fermion systems.\nSince the first Chern number for a massive Majorana fermion \nis given by the sign of the mass ${\\rm sgn}(m_i)/2$,\nthe thermal Hall conductivity of this system is given by,\\cite{nomura}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}=\\sum_i{\\rm sgn}(m_i)\\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T}{24\\hbar}=(N_{+}-N_{-})\\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T}{24\\hbar},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $N_{+(-)}$ is the number of Majorana surface modes with positive (negative) mass.\nAn important question is how $N_{+}-N_{-}$ is related to the bulk topological invariant $w_{\\rm 3D}$.\nThis is by no means trivial, because signs of mass gaps ${\\rm sgn}(m_i)$ crucially depend on characters of perturbations\nwhich generate the mass gaps.\n\n\nNevertheless, it is possible that for an appropriate perturbation, $N_{+}-N_{-}=w_{\\rm 3D}$ holds.\nIndeed, for class DIII topological superconductors in three dimensions,\nsuch a perturbation is realized as a chiral-symmetry breaking field.\\cite{shiozaki,wang-zhang}\nThe Hamiltonian of this perturbation is given by,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\Gamma}=\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\int d\\bm{r}\\Psi^{\\dagger}(\\bm{r})\\Gamma\\Psi(\\bm{r}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Psi(\\bm{r})$ is the Nambu spinor, and $\\Gamma$ is the chiral symmetry operation, which acts \non the BdG Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm BdG}$ as\n$\\Gamma\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm BdG}\\Gamma^{-1}=-\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm BdG}$; i.e. \n$\\Gamma$ anti-commutes with the Hamiltonian. $\\gamma$ is a coupling constant.\nIt is obvious that since $\\Gamma$ commutes with itself, $\\mathcal{H}_{\\Gamma}$ breaks chiral symmetry.\nFor class DIII topological superconductors, chiral symmetry is realized as combination of time-reversal symmetry and particle-hole symmetry.\nIn the representation of the Nambu spinor, $\\Psi=(\\psi_{\\uparrow}, \\psi_{\\downarrow},\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\downarrow},-\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow})^T$,\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\Gamma}=-i\\gamma \\int d{\\bm{r}} (\\psi_{\\uparrow}\\psi_{\\downarrow}-\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\downarrow}\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow})$;

We note that $\\bm{B}_g$ is related to the existence of circulating particle flow, and thus,\nit is expected that the rotation of the system around the symmetric axis may raise $\\bm{B}_g$ parallel to the axis.\nThen, $\\bm{B}_g$ gives rise to gravitomagnetoelectric effect, inducing heat polarization $\\bm{P}_g$ along the axis.\nFurthermore, the response function of this effect is characterized by the winding number:\\cite{shiozaki}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\bm{P}_g=\\pm \\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T^2}{24\\hbar v}w_{\\rm 3D}\\bm{B}_g,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $v$ is the fermi velocity of the surface Majorana fermions.\nThe heat polarization $\\bm{P}_g$ can be detected as temperature difference between the top and bottom surface of the system shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:gra}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{graviME.eps}\n\\caption{Setup for thermal analogue of magnetoelectric effect.

The state is represented by $|n_{12}n_{34}\\rangle$ with $n_{12}$ and $n_{34}$, respectively, the occupation numbers of the fermion operators $\\psi_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{1}+i\\gamma_{2})$  and $\\psi_{34}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{3}+i\\gamma_{4})$.\nFor the even (odd) parity sector, the doubly-degenerate states are $|11\\rangle$ and $|00\\rangle$ ($|10\\rangle$ and $|01\\rangle$).\nIn the two-dimensional space spanned by these states, the braiding operators (\\ref{eq:uij}) are respresented with the use of the Pauli matrices:\n$U_{1,2}=(1-i\\sigma_z)/\\sqrt{2}$, $U_{2,3}=(1-i\\sigma_x)/\\sqrt{2}$, $U_{3,1}=(1-i\\sigma_y)/\\sqrt{2}$.  \nThus, the braidings of two Majorana fermions lead to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$-rotations around $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes.\nThe NOT gate is given by $(U_{2,3})^2=-i\\sigma_x$, and the phase gate is,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{1,2}=\ne^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nup to phase factors.\nAlso, the Hadamard gate $H$ is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH\\equiv (U_{2,3})^2U_{3,1}=\n\\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAny one-qubit gates except the $\\pi/8$-gate can be constructed from the above operations. \n\n\n\nThe $\\pi/8$-gate may be realized by topologically-unprotected operations such as the fusion of two Majorana fermions which yields dynamical phase\nchange.\\cite{bravyi,freedman2} The dynamical phase can be tuned to be equal to $\\pi/8$. \nAn alternative method for realizing the $\\pi/8$-gate is to change the genus of the shape of the system during the brading of Majorana modes,\nthough the implementation in real systems  is technically highly challenging.\n\nWe, now, consider two-qubit operations. \nThe following argument is based on the seminal papaers by Kitaev and Bravyi.\\cite{bravyi-kitaev,bravyi-kitaev2,bravyi} \nFor brevity, we change the notation of one qubit state as $|00\\rangle$  ( or $|01\\rangle$ )  $\\rightarrow |0\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$  ( or $|10\\rangle$ )  $\\rightarrow |1\\rangle$.\nThe basis of the two-qubit state space is $\\{ |0\\rangle |0\\rangle, |0\\rangle |1\\rangle,|1\\rangle |0\\rangle,|1\\rangle |1\\rangle\\}$,\nwhere the first qubit consists of Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, $\\gamma_4$, and\nthe second qubit consists of $\\gamma_5$, $\\gamma_6$, $\\gamma_7$, $\\gamma_8$.\nThe CNOT gate for this two-qubit space is expressed in terms of the Hadamard gate $H$ and the controlled $\\sigma_z$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Lambda(\\sigma_x)&\\equiv&\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbb{I} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sigma_x\n\\end{array}\n\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nH & 0 \\\\\n0 & H\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\Lambda(\\sigma_z)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nH^{\\dagger} & 0 \\\\\n0 & H^{\\dagger}\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:CNOT}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the controlled $\\sigma_z$ gate,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Lambda(\\sigma_z)\\equiv \\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbb{I} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sigma_z\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand $\\mathbb{I}$ a $2\\times 2$ identity matrix. \nNote that $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ for the first (second) qubit are the eigen states of $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2$ \n($i\\gamma_5\\gamma_6$) with the eigen values $-1$ and $1$, respectively.\nThen, the controlled $\\sigma_z$ gate is expressed as,\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n &&\\Lambda (\\sigma_z)=\\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{4}(1-i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2)(1-i\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)) \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)U_{1,2}U_{5,6}, \\label{eq:Csigmaz}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $U_{1,2}$  and $U_{5,6}$ are the braiding operators for $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, and $\\gamma_5$, $\\gamma_6$,\nrespectively.\nFurthermore, the operation $\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)$ can be implemented \nin the following way. We prepare two ancillary Majorana fermions $\\gamma_9$ and $\\gamma_{10}$\nin addition to the two Majorana qubits. We also prepare a state satisfying $(\\gamma_9+i\\gamma_{10})|\\psi\\rangle=0$;\ni.e. the vaccum state for a complex fermion operator $\\psi_{9,10}=(\\gamma_9+i\\gamma_{10})/2$. \nThen, it follows,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&&\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)|\\psi\\rangle=2U_{10,6}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{+}\\Pi^{(4)}_{+}|\\psi\\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=2i(U_{2,1})^2(U_{5,6})^2\nU_{10,6}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{+}\\Pi^{(4)}_{-}|\\psi\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=2i(U_{2,1})^2(U_{5,6})^2\nU_{6,10}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{-}\\Pi^{(4)}_{+}|\\psi\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=2U_{6,10}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{-}\\Pi^{(4)}_{-}|\\psi\\rangle,\n\\label{eq:exp1256}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere $\\Pi^{(2)}_{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}(1\\mp i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9)$ and $\\Pi^{(4)}_{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}(1\\pm \\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9)$.\n$\\Pi^{(2)}_{+(-)}$ is the projection operator for the measurement of the eigenvalue of $-i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9$\nwhich results in the eigenvalue $+1$ ($-1$).\n$\\Pi^{(4)}_{+(-)}$ is the projection to the state with $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9=+1$ ($-1$).\nThus, the measurement of the eigenvalues of $i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9$ and $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9$\ncombined with the braiding operations in eq.(\\ref{eq:exp1256}) realizes\nthe operation $\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)$.\nFor instance, if the measurement of $-i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9$ and $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9$\ngives the eigenvalues $-i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9=1$ and $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9=1$,\nthen, the braiding operation $U_{10,6}$ combined with $U_{1,2}$ and $U_{5,6}$ leads to  \nthe controlled $\\sigma_z$ gate $\\Lambda(\\sigma_z)$, eq.(\\ref{eq:Csigmaz}). \nThis completes the realization scheme of the CNOT gate (\\ref{eq:CNOT}).\nThere is also a  different approach for the realization of the CNOT gate, which\nutilizes two-qubit states composed of six Majorana fermions.\\cite{georg}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above scenarios, it is crucially important for the readout scheme of the Majorana qubit to carry out the non-demolition measurement of the fermion parity. \nThe direct measurement of the Majorana qubit state via the coupling with electronic probes such as STM results in decoherence of the qubit state, \\cite{budich} since, as mentioned before, the coupling with external electron leads breaks the conservation of the fermion parity.\nA promising approach for the non-demolition measurement of the fermion parity is \nto use the Aharonov-Casher effect.\\cite{hassler}\nWhen vortex currents flow encircling an isolated superconducting island which contains Majorana qubits, \nthe interefence of vortex currents is affected by the fermion parity of Majorana qubits. \nThis detection scheme does not destroy the fermion parity in the island.\n\n\nThe braiding operation of Majorana fermions which demonstrates the non-Abelian statistics\nis the most important factor in all the above schemes.\nThis operation may be carried out by using interferometer-type setup considered in Sec.4.4, and also \nby controlling a bias voltage in nanowire superconductors, which transport the position of the Majorana end state of the wire.\\cite{alicea-fisher}\nAnother promising proposal is to utilize Coulomb-blockaded quantum dots coupled to Majorana end states of superconducting nanowires.\\cite{flensberg-non-abelian} In this approach, the change of the occupation number\nof electrons in the dot induces the flip of Majorana qubits. Although this operation is not topologically protected \nbut requires tuning of parameters of the system, its feasibility and controllability are fascinating.\nThe braiding operation is also carried out by controlling the tunneling amplitude between two Majorana fermions.\\cite{braiding1,braiding2} For instance, when there are three Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$, \n$\\gamma_2$, and $\\gamma_3$ with the tunneling Hamiltonian, $\\mathcal{H}=t_{12}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2+t_{23}\\gamma_2\\gamma_3$,\n ($t_{12}>0$, $t_{23}>0$),\nthe Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$ is transferred to $\\gamma_3$ by changing the parameter $t_{12}/t_{23}$ \nfrom $0$ to $\\infty$. The tuning of the tunneling amplitude can be implemented by controlling a gate voltage,\\cite{braiding1} or also by controlling the charging energy via the change of a magnetic flux penetrating a Josephson junction system.\\cite{braiding3,braiding4}\n \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Interaction effects}\n\\label{sec:interaction}\n\nTo this date, most of studies on topological phases have been focused on non-interacting fermion system, \nthough there are some important research works on quantum spin systems and boson systems, \nwhere strong interactions play an important role for the realization of topological phases.\\cite{pollmann,wen} \nEffects of electron-electron interaction on topological insulators and superconductors have not yet been fully understood.\nHowever, recently, significant progress has been achieved for topological classification of\ninteraction systems in certain symmetry classes. \nInteraction between electrons can change the topological classification obtained for free-fremion systems.\nAn important example is a time-reversal symmetric 1D topological superconductor in class BDI.\\cite{fidkow1,fidkow2} \nIn the absence of interactions, this class allows multiple numbers of Majorana zero modes, signifying\nthe $Z$ nontriviality\ncharacterized by the winding number.\nFidkowski and Kitaev showed that mutual interactions between fermions preserving time-reversal symmetry\ncan change the $Z$ non-triviality of the 1D BDI class to the $Z_8$ non-triviality,\ngapping out eight Majorana modes.\nAnother important example is a class DIII superconductor in three dimensions, which is also characterized by the winding number taking any integer values.\nInteractions between electrons can change the $Z$ non-triviality to the $Z_{16}$ non-triviality.\\cite{fidkow3,wang,metlitski}\n\n\n\\subsection{1D class BDI : $Z \\rightarrow Z_8$ }\n\nThe topological phase of the 1D BDI class is characterized by the winding number which takes any integer values; \ni.e. it has $Z$ non-triviality. \nThus, it is possible that there are multiple Majorana zero modes at open edges of the system.\nThe essential features of this class are ingeniously described by the Kitaev Majorana chain model,  which\nis a simple model for 1D spinless $p$-wave superconductor.\\cite{kitaev-majorana-chain}\nLet us consider an $N$-channel Kitaev chain model, the Hamiltonian of which is,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}&=&\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^L[-w(a^{\\dagger}_{j\\alpha}a_{j+1\\alpha}+h.c.)\n-\\mu (a^{\\dagger}_{j\\alpha}a_{j\\alpha}-\\frac{1}{2}) \\nonumber \\\\\n&&+\\Delta a_{j\\alpha}a_{j+1\\alpha}\n+\\Delta a^{\\dagger}_{j+1\\alpha}a^{\\dagger}_{j\\alpha}].\n\\label{eq:kitaev-chain}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $a_{j\\alpha}$ ($a^{\\dagger}_{j\\alpha}$) is an annihilation (a creation) operator for a spinless fermion at $j$-site and in the $\\alpha$-th channel,\nand $L$ is the total number of lattice sites along the chain direction.\nIntroducing Majorana fields $\\gamma_{2j-1\\alpha}$ and $\\gamma_{2j\\alpha}$ satisfying\n\\begin{eqnarray}\na_{j\\alpha}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{2j-1\\alpha}+i\\gamma_{2j\\alpha}), \n\\end{eqnarray}\nwe can rewrite the Hamiltonian into the form,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}&=&\\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^N\\sum_{j-1}^{L-1}[-\\mu \\gamma_{2j-1\\alpha}\\gamma_{2j \\alpha}+ (w+\\Delta)\\gamma_{2j\\alpha}\\gamma_{2j+1\\alpha}\n\\nonumber \\\\\n&&+(-w+\\Delta)\\gamma_{2j-1\\alpha}\\gamma_{2j+2\\alpha}].\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe can deform continuously the parameters of the non-trivial phase with $\\Delta\\neq 0$ \nto the case with $\\Delta=w>0$ and $\\mu=0$ without closing the energy gap. The topological character is maintained by this deformation. \nThe deformed Hamiltonian is,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm D}=iw\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N}\\sum_{j-1}^{L-1}\\gamma_{2j\\alpha}\\gamma_{2j+1\\alpha}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThen, the Majorana fermions $\\gamma_{1\\alpha}$ at the site $j=1$ and $\\gamma_{2L\\alpha}$ at the site $j=L$ are decoupled.\nThere are $N$ Majorana zero modes at each end of the chain, characterizing the $Z$ non-triviality of the 1D BDI class.\nTime-reversal symmetry characterized by the invariance under the complex conjugate operation $K$ prohibits terms like $i \\gamma_{1\\alpha_1}\\gamma_{1\\alpha_2}$ which generates mass gap for the Majorana modes. \nHowever, mutual interactions between fermions change the situation drastically.\nFor the case of $1\\leq N \\leq 3$, $N$ Majorana zero modes are still protected by time-reversal symmetry.\nFor the case of $N=4$, there are four Majorana zero modes at one end in the absence of interactions.\nWe denote the four Majorana fermions at the $j=1$ site as $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, and $\\gamma_4$\nomitting the site index for brevity. \nThen,  time-reversal symmetry allows the interaction term\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm int}=U\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}.\n\\label{eq:majo-int} \n\\end{eqnarray} \nIn the absence of the interaction $U=0$, there are $2\\times 2=4$ degeneracy at the $j=1$ site,\nexpressed by the pseudo-spin operators $\\sigma_{z1}=-i\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}$ and\n$\\sigma_{z2}=-i\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}$.\nThe interaction (\\ref{eq:majo-int}) lifts this four-fold degeneracy to the double degeneracy, \n$(\\sigma_{z1},\\sigma_{z2})=(1,-1), (-1,1)$ or $(-1,-1), (1,1)$.\nThe case with $5\\leq N \\leq 7$ can be understood as the combination of the $N=4$ case and the $N-4$ case.\nThus, the cases of $1\\leq N \\leq 7$ are still non-trivial, though the topological degeneracy is changed by\nthe interaction effect.\nIn contrast, for the case with $N=8$, the topological degeneracy is completely lifted by mutual interactions, and the system becomes trivial.\nTo see this, we consider eight Majorana fermions at the site $j=1$, $\\gamma_{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha=1, 2, 3, ..., 8$.\nWe divide them into two groups $\\alpha=1\\sim 4$ and $\\alpha=5\\sim 8$, and introduce the interaction term,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm int}=U_1\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}+U_2\\gamma_{5}\\gamma_{6}\\gamma_{7}\\gamma_{8},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich lifts the 16-fold degeneracy in the absence of interactions to the four-fold degeneracy (two sets of the doubly-degenerate state).\nLet us assume $U_{1,2}<0$, and restrict the argument within a lower energy state $|0\\rangle$ which satisfies\n$\\gamma_1\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}|0\\rangle=|0\\rangle$ and\n$\\gamma_{5}\\gamma_{6}\\gamma_{7}\\gamma_8|0\\rangle=|0\\rangle$. \n(For the case of the opposite signs of $U_{1,2}$, we can use a lower energy state satisfying\n$\\gamma_1\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}|0\\rangle=-|0\\rangle$ and\n$\\gamma_{5}\\gamma_{6}\\gamma_{7}\\gamma_8|0\\rangle=-|0\\rangle$)\nWe, now, introduce two sets of auxiliary spin operators,\\cite{kitaev-model}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{x}^{(1)}=i\\gamma_1\\gamma_4, \\quad \\sigma_{y}^{(1)}=i\\gamma_2\\gamma_4,\n\\quad \\sigma_{z}^{(1)}=i\\gamma_3\\gamma_4,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{x}^{(2)}=i\\gamma_5\\gamma_8, \\quad \\sigma_{y}^{(2)}=i\\gamma_6\\gamma_8,\n\\quad \\sigma_{z}^{(2)}=i\\gamma_7\\gamma_8.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe can easily see that $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{(1)}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{(2)}$ satisfy \nthe commutation relations $\\sigma^{(1)}_{\\mu}\\sigma^{(1)}_{\\nu}=i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{(1)}$\nand $\\sigma^{(2)}_{\\mu}\\sigma^{(2)}_{\\nu}=i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{(2)}$ ($\\mu,\\nu,\\lambda=x,y,z$)\nwithin the lower energy state $|0\\rangle$.\nThe eigen states of $\\sigma_z^{(1)}$ and $\\sigma_z^{(2)}$ represent the four-fold degeneracy of\n$|0\\rangle$.\nThus, introducing the \"exchange interaction\" between these spins,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm ex}&=&J\\bm{\\sigma}^{(1)}\\cdot\\bm{\\sigma}^{(2)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&=&-J(\\gamma_1\\gamma_4\\gamma_5\\gamma_8+\\gamma_2\\gamma_4\\gamma_6\\gamma_8+\\gamma_3\\gamma_4\\gamma_7\\gamma_8),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwe can lift the four-fold degeneracy.\nFor $J>0$, the lowest energy state is \"spin-singlet\", i.e. a trivial state with no topological degeneracy.\nThis implies that the $Z$ non-triviality for non-interacting 1D BDI class is reduced to the $Z_8$ non-triviality\nfor interacting systems.\nThere are only seven distinguished topological phases. \nThe above argument is rather heuristic. More sophisticated argument is presented in refs.\\cite{fidkow1,fidkow2}\n\n\n\\subsection{3D class DIII : $Z\\rightarrow Z_{16}$ }\n\nInteraction effects on the 3D topological superconductors in class DIII have been studied by Fidkowski et al., Wang and Senthil, and Metlitski et al.\\cite{fidkow3, wang, metlitski}\nIt was shown by these authors that interaction effects changes the $Z$ non-triviality for non-interacting systems to the $Z_{16}$ non-triviality, and thus, 16 Majorana surface states are gapped out by interaction effects without breaking symmetry of the systems, which leads to a trivial phase.\nTo see this, let us consider 16 surface Majorana states on the (001)-surface of a 3D topological superconductor. \nWe assume that energies of all the Majorana fermions cross zero at $\\bm{k}=0$ for simplicity. \nThen, in the absence of the mutual interaction between electrons, the Hamiltonian is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}=\\int d{\\bm{r}}\\sum_{i=1}^{16}\\chi_i^{T}(\\bm{r})(\\hat{k}_x\\sigma_z+\\hat{k}_y\\sigma_x)\\chi_i(\\bm{r}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\hat{k}_{\\mu}=-i\\partial_{\\mu}$, $\\bm{r}=(x,y)$, and $\\chi_i^T=(\\gamma_{i\\uparrow},\\gamma_{i\\downarrow})$. \n$\\gamma_{i\\sigma}$ is the $i$-th Majorana field with spin $\\sigma$. \nUsing complex fermion fields $\\psi_i(\\bm{r})=\\chi_{2i-1}(\\bm{r})+i\\chi_{2i}(\\bm{r})$,\nwe rewrite the Hamiltonian into that of Dirac fermions,\n\\begin{eqnarray}  \n\\mathcal{H}=\\int d\\bm{r}\\sum_{i=1}^8\\psi^{\\dagger}_i(\\bm{r})(\\hat{k}_x\\sigma_z+\\hat{k}_y\\sigma_x)\\psi_i(\\bm{r}).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHowever, the Dirac fermion field $\\psi_i$ obeys unusual time-reversal symmetry operation.\nSince, under time-reversal $\\mathcal{T}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\chi_{i\\uparrow}\\rightarrow \\chi_{i\\downarrow}, \\qquad\n\\chi_{i\\downarrow}\\rightarrow -\\chi_{i\\uparrow},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nthe $\\psi_i$ field transforms as,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&&\\psi_{i\\uparrow}\\rightarrow \\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\downarrow}, \\qquad\n\\psi_{i\\downarrow}\\rightarrow -\\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\uparrow}, \\nonumber \\\\\n&&\\psi_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\rightarrow \\psi_{i\\downarrow}, \\qquad\n\\psi_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}\\rightarrow -\\psi_{i\\uparrow}.\n\\label{eq:psi-tr}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe, now, add a spin-singlet $s$-wave pairing interaction term for the Dirac fermion to the free-fermion Hamiltonian,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm pair}=\\sum_{i=1}^8\\int d\\bm{r}\\Delta(\\bm{r})\\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\uparrow}(\\bm{r})\\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\downarrow}(\\bm{r})+h.c..\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThis pairing term breaks time reversal symmetry as well as $U(1)$ symmetry, because, as seen from (\\ref{eq:psi-tr}), under $\\mathcal{T}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta \\rightarrow -\\Delta^{*}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus, the surface Majorana fermions protected by time reversal symmetry are gapped out by the pairing term.\nTo recover time reversal symmetry, we introduce many vortices of the phase of $\\Delta$, which are not in the Abrikosov lattice state, but fluctuate; i.e. spatial correlation of the phase decays exponentially. \nWe consider the situation that vortices exist only for the surface pairing state, and not in the bulk of the 3D topological superconductor.\nIt is known that there is no thermodynamics phase transition between the normal state and a vortex liquid state.\nThus, in this surface vortex liquid state, time reversal symmetry as well as $U(1)$ symmetry is preserved, though\nthe surface Dirac fermion $\\psi_{i}$ acquires an energy gap.\nHowever,  we need to be careful about vortex core states, because there is a Majorana zero mode \nin a vortex core of the superconducting state of Dirac fermions.\\cite{jackiw-rossi}\nFor our system with eight Dirac fermions, there are eight Majorana zero modes in a single vortex core.\nThis situation is similar to the case discussed in the previous subsection.\nWe can apply the same argument as that for the 1D BDI model to the eight Majorana zero modes in the vortex core,\nand find that eight Majorana fermions are gapped out by interaction effects, and not topologically protected.\nThus, there is no gapless mode in vortex cores of the surface vortex liquid state.\nThe surface state with 16 Majorana cones is fully gapped by interaction effects, preserving symmetry of the system; i.e. \nthe bulk and the surface states are topologically equivalent to a trivial superconducting state.\nThis implies that the $Z$ non-triviality of the 3D class DIII superconductors for non-interacting systems\nis reduced to the $Z_{16}$ non-triviality for interacting systems.\n \n \n\\section{Weyl superconductor}\n\\label{sec:weyl}\n\n\\subsection{Basic features}\n\nIn this section, we briefly review a novel topological superconducting state referred to as a Weyl superconductor, which \nis different from, but deeply related to topological superconductors. \nWeyl superconductors are characterized by nodal excitations from point-nodes of the superconducting gap, where the amplitude of the gap function is\nzero.\\cite{volovik,balents1} \nTo illustrate the basic idea, we use a simple toy model of a spinless chiral $p+ip$ wave superconductor in three dimensions.\nThe Hamiltonian is,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{\\bm{k}^2-k_F^2}{2m} & \\Delta_0 (k_x-ik_y) \\\\\n\\Delta_0 (k_x+ik_y) & -\\frac{\\bm{k}^2-k_F^2}{2m}\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:weyl0}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $k_F$ the Fermi wave-number, and $\\Delta_0 >0$.\nThere are two point nodes of the superconducting gap at $(0,0,k_F)$ and $(0,0,-k_F)$.\nThe Bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations from the point nodes have $\\bm{k}$-linear energy dispersion which mimics \nmassless Dirac fermions in three dimensions. \nA low-energy effective Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})$ for the nodal excitation from the point node at $(0,0,k_F)$ can be written in the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})=v_xk_x\\tau_x+v_yk_y\\tau_y+v_z(k_z-k_{F})\\tau_z, \n\\label{eq:weyl1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\bm{\\tau}=(\\tau_x,\\tau_y,\\tau_z)$  are the Pauli matrices for the particle-hole space, $v_{x,y,z}$ is the velocity in the $x,y,z$ direction. \nIt noted that $v_{x,y,z}>0$,\nThus, we can adiabatically change the values of $v_{x,y,z}$ to satisfy $v_{x}=v_y=v_z=1$ without changing the topological features explained below. \nThen, eq.(\\ref{eq:weyl1}) is recast into \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 146657, "prevtext": "\nwhere

The sign of $\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}$ is determined by the detail of the band structure, i.e. the Berry curvature.\n\nThe above result is directly applicable to real materials showing chiral superconducting state.\nFor instance. in the case of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$,  which is one of the most promising candidate of a $p+ip$ chiral superconductor,\nthere are three bands with spin degeneracy, and the Fermi surfaces of two of them have positive curvature leading to the positive Berry curvature,\nwhile the other one has the negative Berry curvature.\nThus, the total contributions to the thermal Hall conductivity is\n$\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}=\\frac{\\pi T}{12}(2+2-2)=\\frac{\\pi T}{6}\\sim 10^{-4} ~T$ (W/K$\\cdot$m).\nAlthough this magnitude is quite small, rendering its experimental detection highly challenging, we believe that it is still possible\nto observe this effect by precise measurements.\nRecently, a detailed analysis of the gap function for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ suggests\nthe existence of higher harmonics of the gap function which leads to large Chern number,\nand the thermal Hall conductivity $\\kappa_{xy}=\\frac{7}{12}\\pi T$.\\cite{s-simon}\n\n\\subsection{Cases of TRS topological superconductors}\n\nFor class DIII time-reversal-symmetric topological superconductors in three dimensions, \nthere are Majorana surface states, which carry heat currents. \nFor this class, \nthe bulk topological invariant is defined as a winding number which takes any integer values, as explained in section \\ref{subsec:TRS},\nand the winding number $w_{\\rm 3D}$ is precisely equal to the total number of topologically protected surface gapless  Majorana modes. \nThis topological invariant appears in thermal transport coefficient, as in the case of chiral superconductors.\nHowever, an important difference is that, in this case, one needs to break time-reversal symmetry to realize quantum thermal Hall effect\nby adding external perturbations to the system.\nPerturbations which break time-reversal symmetry (more precisely chiral symmetry, as will be elucidated later),\ninduce mass gap of the Majorana surface state, and hence, the 2D surface state exhibit the quantum thermal Hall effect,\nas in the case of 2D chiral superconductors. \nAn effective theory for the surface state is described by $M$-species of 2D free Majorana fermions with mass gaps $m_i$ ($i=1, 2,..., M$).\nWe can apply the formula (\\ref{thermalHall}) to these Majorana fermion systems.\nSince the first Chern number for a massive Majorana fermion \nis given by the sign of the mass ${\\rm sgn}(m_i)/2$,\nthe thermal Hall conductivity of this system is given by,\\cite{nomura}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}=\\sum_i{\\rm sgn}(m_i)\\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T}{24\\hbar}=(N_{+}-N_{-})\\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T}{24\\hbar},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $N_{+(-)}$ is the number of Majorana surface modes with positive (negative) mass.\nAn important question is how $N_{+}-N_{-}$ is related to the bulk topological invariant $w_{\\rm 3D}$.\nThis is by no means trivial, because signs of mass gaps ${\\rm sgn}(m_i)$ crucially depend on characters of perturbations\nwhich generate the mass gaps.\n\n\nNevertheless, it is possible that for an appropriate perturbation, $N_{+}-N_{-}=w_{\\rm 3D}$ holds.\nIndeed, for class DIII topological superconductors in three dimensions,\nsuch a perturbation is realized as a chiral-symmetry breaking field.\\cite{shiozaki,wang-zhang}\nThe Hamiltonian of this perturbation is given by,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\Gamma}=\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\int d\\bm{r}\\Psi^{\\dagger}(\\bm{r})\\Gamma\\Psi(\\bm{r}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Psi(\\bm{r})$ is the Nambu spinor, and $\\Gamma$ is the chiral symmetry operation, which acts \non the BdG Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm BdG}$ as\n$\\Gamma\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm BdG}\\Gamma^{-1}=-\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm BdG}$; i.e. \n$\\Gamma$ anti-commutes with the Hamiltonian. $\\gamma$ is a coupling constant.\nIt is obvious that since $\\Gamma$ commutes with itself, $\\mathcal{H}_{\\Gamma}$ breaks chiral symmetry.\nFor class DIII topological superconductors, chiral symmetry is realized as combination of time-reversal symmetry and particle-hole symmetry.\nIn the representation of the Nambu spinor, $\\Psi=(\\psi_{\\uparrow}, \\psi_{\\downarrow},\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\downarrow},-\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow})^T$,\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\Gamma}=-i\\gamma \\int d{\\bm{r}} (\\psi_{\\uparrow}\\psi_{\\downarrow}-\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\downarrow}\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\uparrow})$; \n i.e. an imaginary part of a spin-singlet pairing field.\n\n\n\n\nHence, for a heterostructure system composed of a topological superconductor with a surface on which \na conventional spin-singlet superconductor with a nonzero imaginary gap is placed, \nthe bulk topological invariant $N$ appears in \nthe quantized thermal Hall conductivity given by,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}=w_{\\rm 3D}\\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T}{24\\hbar}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAn important point here is that signs of \nmass gaps of Majorana surface states generated the $\\Gamma$ perturbation exactly coincide with those of the winding number\ncorresponding to the Majorana surface states, which guarantees the relation $\\sum_i{\\rm sgn}(m_i)=w_{\\rm 3D}$.\\cite{shiozaki,wang-zhang}\n\n\n\nThermal responses characterized by the winding number also appear in thermal analogue of magnetoelectric effects, \nwhich are referred to as gravitomagnetoelectric effects.\\cite{shiozaki}\nTo explain such effects, let us consider a system with cylindrical geometry composed of a topological superconductor and an imaginary spin-singlet superconductor,\nas shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:gra}.\nWe, here, introduce a gravitomagnetic field $\\bm{B}_g$, which is associated circulating heat (or energy) currents, in analogy with a magnetic field\nrelated to circulating charge currents. We note that $\\bm{B}_g$ is related to the existence of circulating particle flow, and thus,\nit is expected that the rotation of the system around the symmetric axis may raise $\\bm{B}_g$ parallel to the axis.\nThen, $\\bm{B}_g$ gives rise to gravitomagnetoelectric effect, inducing heat polarization $\\bm{P}_g$ along the axis.\nFurthermore, the response function of this effect is characterized by the winding number:\\cite{shiozaki}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\bm{P}_g=\\pm \\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T^2}{24\\hbar v}w_{\\rm 3D}\\bm{B}_g,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $v$ is the fermi velocity of the surface Majorana fermions.\nThe heat polarization $\\bm{P}_g$ can be detected as temperature difference between the top and bottom surface of the system shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:gra}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=9cm]{graviME.eps}\n\\caption{Setup for thermal analogue of magnetoelectric effect.

The state is represented by $|n_{12}n_{34}\\rangle$ with $n_{12}$ and $n_{34}$, respectively, the occupation numbers of the fermion operators $\\psi_{12}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{1}+i\\gamma_{2})$  and $\\psi_{34}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\gamma_{3}+i\\gamma_{4})$.\nFor the even (odd) parity sector, the doubly-degenerate states are $|11\\rangle$ and $|00\\rangle$ ($|10\\rangle$ and $|01\\rangle$).\nIn the two-dimensional space spanned by these states, the braiding operators (\\ref{eq:uij}) are respresented with the use of the Pauli matrices:\n$U_{1,2}=(1-i\\sigma_z)/\\sqrt{2}$, $U_{2,3}=(1-i\\sigma_x)/\\sqrt{2}$, $U_{3,1}=(1-i\\sigma_y)/\\sqrt{2}$.  \nThus, the braidings of two Majorana fermions lead to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$-rotations around $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes.\nThe NOT gate is given by $(U_{2,3})^2=-i\\sigma_x$, and the phase gate is,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nU_{1,2}=\ne^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & i\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\end{eqnarray}\nup to phase factors.\nAlso, the Hadamard gate $H$ is \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nH\\equiv (U_{2,3})^2U_{3,1}=\n\\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -1\n\\end{array}\n\\right).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAny one-qubit gates except the $\\pi/8$-gate can be constructed from the above operations. \n\n\n\nThe $\\pi/8$-gate may be realized by topologically-unprotected operations such as the fusion of two Majorana fermions which yields dynamical phase\nchange.\\cite{bravyi,freedman2} The dynamical phase can be tuned to be equal to $\\pi/8$. \nAn alternative method for realizing the $\\pi/8$-gate is to change the genus of the shape of the system during the brading of Majorana modes,\nthough the implementation in real systems  is technically highly challenging.\n\nWe, now, consider two-qubit operations. \nThe following argument is based on the seminal papaers by Kitaev and Bravyi.\\cite{bravyi-kitaev,bravyi-kitaev2,bravyi} \nFor brevity, we change the notation of one qubit state as $|00\\rangle$  ( or $|01\\rangle$ )  $\\rightarrow |0\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$  ( or $|10\\rangle$ )  $\\rightarrow |1\\rangle$.\nThe basis of the two-qubit state space is $\\{ |0\\rangle |0\\rangle, |0\\rangle |1\\rangle,|1\\rangle |0\\rangle,|1\\rangle |1\\rangle\\}$,\nwhere the first qubit consists of Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, $\\gamma_4$, and\nthe second qubit consists of $\\gamma_5$, $\\gamma_6$, $\\gamma_7$, $\\gamma_8$.\nThe CNOT gate for this two-qubit space is expressed in terms of the Hadamard gate $H$ and the controlled $\\sigma_z$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Lambda(\\sigma_x)&\\equiv&\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbb{I} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sigma_x\n\\end{array}\n\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&=&\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nH & 0 \\\\\n0 & H\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\Lambda(\\sigma_z)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nH^{\\dagger} & 0 \\\\\n0 & H^{\\dagger}\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:CNOT}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the controlled $\\sigma_z$ gate,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Lambda(\\sigma_z)\\equiv \\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbb{I} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sigma_z\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand $\\mathbb{I}$ a $2\\times 2$ identity matrix. \nNote that $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ for the first (second) qubit are the eigen states of $i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2$ \n($i\\gamma_5\\gamma_6$) with the eigen values $-1$ and $1$, respectively.\nThen, the controlled $\\sigma_z$ gate is expressed as,\n \\begin{eqnarray}\n &&\\Lambda (\\sigma_z)=\\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{4}(1-i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2)(1-i\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)) \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)U_{1,2}U_{5,6}, \\label{eq:Csigmaz}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $U_{1,2}$  and $U_{5,6}$ are the braiding operators for $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, and $\\gamma_5$, $\\gamma_6$,\nrespectively.\nFurthermore, the operation $\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)$ can be implemented \nin the following way. We prepare two ancillary Majorana fermions $\\gamma_9$ and $\\gamma_{10}$\nin addition to the two Majorana qubits. We also prepare a state satisfying $(\\gamma_9+i\\gamma_{10})|\\psi\\rangle=0$;\ni.e. the vaccum state for a complex fermion operator $\\psi_{9,10}=(\\gamma_9+i\\gamma_{10})/2$. \nThen, it follows,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&&\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)|\\psi\\rangle=2U_{10,6}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{+}\\Pi^{(4)}_{+}|\\psi\\rangle   \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=2i(U_{2,1})^2(U_{5,6})^2\nU_{10,6}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{+}\\Pi^{(4)}_{-}|\\psi\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=2i(U_{2,1})^2(U_{5,6})^2\nU_{6,10}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{-}\\Pi^{(4)}_{+}|\\psi\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&&=2U_{6,10}\n\\Pi^{(2)}_{-}\\Pi^{(4)}_{-}|\\psi\\rangle,\n\\label{eq:exp1256}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere $\\Pi^{(2)}_{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}(1\\mp i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9)$ and $\\Pi^{(4)}_{\\pm}=\\frac{1}{2}(1\\pm \\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9)$.\n$\\Pi^{(2)}_{+(-)}$ is the projection operator for the measurement of the eigenvalue of $-i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9$\nwhich results in the eigenvalue $+1$ ($-1$).\n$\\Pi^{(4)}_{+(-)}$ is the projection to the state with $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9=+1$ ($-1$).\nThus, the measurement of the eigenvalues of $i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9$ and $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9$\ncombined with the braiding operations in eq.(\\ref{eq:exp1256}) realizes\nthe operation $\\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_6)$.\nFor instance, if the measurement of $-i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9$ and $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9$\ngives the eigenvalues $-i\\gamma_6\\gamma_9=1$ and $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\gamma_5\\gamma_9=1$,\nthen, the braiding operation $U_{10,6}$ combined with $U_{1,2}$ and $U_{5,6}$ leads to  \nthe controlled $\\sigma_z$ gate $\\Lambda(\\sigma_z)$, eq.(\\ref{eq:Csigmaz}). \nThis completes the realization scheme of the CNOT gate (\\ref{eq:CNOT}).\nThere is also a  different approach for the realization of the CNOT gate, which\nutilizes two-qubit states composed of six Majorana fermions.\\cite{georg}\n\n\n\n\nIn the above scenarios, it is crucially important for the readout scheme of the Majorana qubit to carry out the non-demolition measurement of the fermion parity. \nThe direct measurement of the Majorana qubit state via the coupling with electronic probes such as STM results in decoherence of the qubit state, \\cite{budich} since, as mentioned before, the coupling with external electron leads breaks the conservation of the fermion parity.\nA promising approach for the non-demolition measurement of the fermion parity is \nto use the Aharonov-Casher effect.\\cite{hassler}\nWhen vortex currents flow encircling an isolated superconducting island which contains Majorana qubits, \nthe interefence of vortex currents is affected by the fermion parity of Majorana qubits. \nThis detection scheme does not destroy the fermion parity in the island.\n\n\nThe braiding operation of Majorana fermions which demonstrates the non-Abelian statistics\nis the most important factor in all the above schemes.\nThis operation may be carried out by using interferometer-type setup considered in Sec.4.4, and also \nby controlling a bias voltage in nanowire superconductors, which transport the position of the Majorana end state of the wire.\\cite{alicea-fisher}\nAnother promising proposal is to utilize Coulomb-blockaded quantum dots coupled to Majorana end states of superconducting nanowires.\\cite{flensberg-non-abelian} In this approach, the change of the occupation number\nof electrons in the dot induces the flip of Majorana qubits. Although this operation is not topologically protected \nbut requires tuning of parameters of the system, its feasibility and controllability are fascinating.\nThe braiding operation is also carried out by controlling the tunneling amplitude between two Majorana fermions.\\cite{braiding1,braiding2} For instance, when there are three Majorana fermions $\\gamma_1$, \n$\\gamma_2$, and $\\gamma_3$ with the tunneling Hamiltonian, $\\mathcal{H}=t_{12}\\gamma_1\\gamma_2+t_{23}\\gamma_2\\gamma_3$,\n ($t_{12}>0$, $t_{23}>0$),\nthe Majorana fermion $\\gamma_1$ is transferred to $\\gamma_3$ by changing the parameter $t_{12}/t_{23}$ \nfrom $0$ to $\\infty$.

The topological character is maintained by this deformation. \nThe deformed Hamiltonian is,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm D}=iw\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{N}\\sum_{j-1}^{L-1}\\gamma_{2j\\alpha}\\gamma_{2j+1\\alpha}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThen, the Majorana fermions $\\gamma_{1\\alpha}$ at the site $j=1$ and $\\gamma_{2L\\alpha}$ at the site $j=L$ are decoupled.\nThere are $N$ Majorana zero modes at each end of the chain, characterizing the $Z$ non-triviality of the 1D BDI class.\nTime-reversal symmetry characterized by the invariance under the complex conjugate operation $K$ prohibits terms like $i \\gamma_{1\\alpha_1}\\gamma_{1\\alpha_2}$ which generates mass gap for the Majorana modes. \nHowever, mutual interactions between fermions change the situation drastically.\nFor the case of $1\\leq N \\leq 3$, $N$ Majorana zero modes are still protected by time-reversal symmetry.\nFor the case of $N=4$, there are four Majorana zero modes at one end in the absence of interactions.\nWe denote the four Majorana fermions at the $j=1$ site as $\\gamma_1$, $\\gamma_2$, $\\gamma_3$, and $\\gamma_4$\nomitting the site index for brevity. \nThen,  time-reversal symmetry allows the interaction term\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm int}=U\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}.\n\\label{eq:majo-int} \n\\end{eqnarray} \nIn the absence of the interaction $U=0$, there are $2\\times 2=4$ degeneracy at the $j=1$ site,\nexpressed by the pseudo-spin operators $\\sigma_{z1}=-i\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}$ and\n$\\sigma_{z2}=-i\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}$.\nThe interaction (\\ref{eq:majo-int}) lifts this four-fold degeneracy to the double degeneracy, \n$(\\sigma_{z1},\\sigma_{z2})=(1,-1), (-1,1)$ or $(-1,-1), (1,1)$.\nThe case with $5\\leq N \\leq 7$ can be understood as the combination of the $N=4$ case and the $N-4$ case.\nThus, the cases of $1\\leq N \\leq 7$ are still non-trivial, though the topological degeneracy is changed by\nthe interaction effect.\nIn contrast, for the case with $N=8$, the topological degeneracy is completely lifted by mutual interactions, and the system becomes trivial.\nTo see this, we consider eight Majorana fermions at the site $j=1$, $\\gamma_{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha=1, 2, 3, ..., 8$.\nWe divide them into two groups $\\alpha=1\\sim 4$ and $\\alpha=5\\sim 8$, and introduce the interaction term,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm int}=U_1\\gamma_{1}\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}+U_2\\gamma_{5}\\gamma_{6}\\gamma_{7}\\gamma_{8},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich lifts the 16-fold degeneracy in the absence of interactions to the four-fold degeneracy (two sets of the doubly-degenerate state).\nLet us assume $U_{1,2}<0$, and restrict the argument within a lower energy state $|0\\rangle$ which satisfies\n$\\gamma_1\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}|0\\rangle=|0\\rangle$ and\n$\\gamma_{5}\\gamma_{6}\\gamma_{7}\\gamma_8|0\\rangle=|0\\rangle$. \n(For the case of the opposite signs of $U_{1,2}$, we can use a lower energy state satisfying\n$\\gamma_1\\gamma_{2}\\gamma_{3}\\gamma_{4}|0\\rangle=-|0\\rangle$ and\n$\\gamma_{5}\\gamma_{6}\\gamma_{7}\\gamma_8|0\\rangle=-|0\\rangle$)\nWe, now, introduce two sets of auxiliary spin operators,\\cite{kitaev-model}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{x}^{(1)}=i\\gamma_1\\gamma_4, \\quad \\sigma_{y}^{(1)}=i\\gamma_2\\gamma_4,\n\\quad \\sigma_{z}^{(1)}=i\\gamma_3\\gamma_4,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{x}^{(2)}=i\\gamma_5\\gamma_8, \\quad \\sigma_{y}^{(2)}=i\\gamma_6\\gamma_8,\n\\quad \\sigma_{z}^{(2)}=i\\gamma_7\\gamma_8.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe can easily see that $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{(1)}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mu}^{(2)}$ satisfy \nthe commutation relations $\\sigma^{(1)}_{\\mu}\\sigma^{(1)}_{\\nu}=i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{(1)}$\nand $\\sigma^{(2)}_{\\mu}\\sigma^{(2)}_{\\nu}=i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda}\\sigma_{\\lambda}^{(2)}$ ($\\mu,\\nu,\\lambda=x,y,z$)\nwithin the lower energy state $|0\\rangle$.\nThe eigen states of $\\sigma_z^{(1)}$ and $\\sigma_z^{(2)}$ represent the four-fold degeneracy of\n$|0\\rangle$.\nThus, introducing the \"exchange interaction\" between these spins,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm ex}&=&J\\bm{\\sigma}^{(1)}\\cdot\\bm{\\sigma}^{(2)} \\nonumber \\\\\n&=&-J(\\gamma_1\\gamma_4\\gamma_5\\gamma_8+\\gamma_2\\gamma_4\\gamma_6\\gamma_8+\\gamma_3\\gamma_4\\gamma_7\\gamma_8),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwe can lift the four-fold degeneracy.\nFor $J>0$, the lowest energy state is \"spin-singlet\", i.e. a trivial state with no topological degeneracy.\nThis implies that the $Z$ non-triviality for non-interacting 1D BDI class is reduced to the $Z_8$ non-triviality\nfor interacting systems.\nThere are only seven distinguished topological phases. \nThe above argument is rather heuristic. More sophisticated argument is presented in refs.\\cite{fidkow1,fidkow2}\n\n\n\\subsection{3D class DIII : $Z\\rightarrow Z_{16}$ }\n\nInteraction effects on the 3D topological superconductors in class DIII have been studied by Fidkowski et al., Wang and Senthil, and Metlitski et al.\\cite{fidkow3, wang, metlitski}\nIt was shown by these authors that interaction effects changes the $Z$ non-triviality for non-interacting systems to the $Z_{16}$ non-triviality, and thus, 16 Majorana surface states are gapped out by interaction effects without breaking symmetry of the systems, which leads to a trivial phase.\nTo see this, let us consider 16 surface Majorana states on the (001)-surface of a 3D topological superconductor. \nWe assume that energies of all the Majorana fermions cross zero at $\\bm{k}=0$ for simplicity. \nThen, in the absence of the mutual interaction between electrons, the Hamiltonian is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}=\\int d{\\bm{r}}\\sum_{i=1}^{16}\\chi_i^{T}(\\bm{r})(\\hat{k}_x\\sigma_z+\\hat{k}_y\\sigma_x)\\chi_i(\\bm{r}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\hat{k}_{\\mu}=-i\\partial_{\\mu}$, $\\bm{r}=(x,y)$, and $\\chi_i^T=(\\gamma_{i\\uparrow},\\gamma_{i\\downarrow})$. \n$\\gamma_{i\\sigma}$ is the $i$-th Majorana field with spin $\\sigma$. \nUsing complex fermion fields $\\psi_i(\\bm{r})=\\chi_{2i-1}(\\bm{r})+i\\chi_{2i}(\\bm{r})$,\nwe rewrite the Hamiltonian into that of Dirac fermions,\n\\begin{eqnarray}  \n\\mathcal{H}=\\int d\\bm{r}\\sum_{i=1}^8\\psi^{\\dagger}_i(\\bm{r})(\\hat{k}_x\\sigma_z+\\hat{k}_y\\sigma_x)\\psi_i(\\bm{r}).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHowever, the Dirac fermion field $\\psi_i$ obeys unusual time-reversal symmetry operation.\nSince, under time-reversal $\\mathcal{T}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\chi_{i\\uparrow}\\rightarrow \\chi_{i\\downarrow}, \\qquad\n\\chi_{i\\downarrow}\\rightarrow -\\chi_{i\\uparrow},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nthe $\\psi_i$ field transforms as,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&&\\psi_{i\\uparrow}\\rightarrow \\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\downarrow}, \\qquad\n\\psi_{i\\downarrow}\\rightarrow -\\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\uparrow}, \\nonumber \\\\\n&&\\psi_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}\\rightarrow \\psi_{i\\downarrow}, \\qquad\n\\psi_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}\\rightarrow -\\psi_{i\\uparrow}.\n\\label{eq:psi-tr}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe, now, add a spin-singlet $s$-wave pairing interaction term for the Dirac fermion to the free-fermion Hamiltonian,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm pair}=\\sum_{i=1}^8\\int d\\bm{r}\\Delta(\\bm{r})\\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\uparrow}(\\bm{r})\\psi^{\\dagger}_{i\\downarrow}(\\bm{r})+h.c..\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThis pairing term breaks time reversal symmetry as well as $U(1)$ symmetry, because, as seen from (\\ref{eq:psi-tr}), under $\\mathcal{T}$,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta \\rightarrow -\\Delta^{*}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus, the surface Majorana fermions protected by time reversal symmetry are gapped out by the pairing term.\nTo recover time reversal symmetry, we introduce many vortices of the phase of $\\Delta$, which are not in the Abrikosov lattice state, but fluctuate; i.e. spatial correlation of the phase decays exponentially. \nWe consider the situation that vortices exist only for the surface pairing state, and not in the bulk of the 3D topological superconductor.\nIt is known that there is no thermodynamics phase transition between the normal state and a vortex liquid state.\nThus, in this surface vortex liquid state, time reversal symmetry as well as $U(1)$ symmetry is preserved, though\nthe surface Dirac fermion $\\psi_{i}$ acquires an energy gap.\nHowever,  we need to be careful about vortex core states, because there is a Majorana zero mode \nin a vortex core of the superconducting state of Dirac fermions.\\cite{jackiw-rossi}\nFor our system with eight Dirac fermions, there are eight Majorana zero modes in a single vortex core.\nThis situation is similar to the case discussed in the previous subsection.\nWe can apply the same argument as that for the 1D BDI model to the eight Majorana zero modes in the vortex core,\nand find that eight Majorana fermions are gapped out by interaction effects, and not topologically protected.\nThus, there is no gapless mode in vortex cores of the surface vortex liquid state.\nThe surface state with 16 Majorana cones is fully gapped by interaction effects, preserving symmetry of the system; i.e. \nthe bulk and the surface states are topologically equivalent to a trivial superconducting state.\nThis implies that the $Z$ non-triviality of the 3D class DIII superconductors for non-interacting systems\nis reduced to the $Z_{16}$ non-triviality for interacting systems.\n \n \n\\section{Weyl superconductor}\n\\label{sec:weyl}\n\n\\subsection{Basic features}\n\nIn this section, we briefly review a novel topological superconducting state referred to as a Weyl superconductor, which \nis different from, but deeply related to topological superconductors. \nWeyl superconductors are characterized by nodal excitations from point-nodes of the superconducting gap, where the amplitude of the gap function is\nzero.\\cite{volovik,balents1} \nTo illustrate the basic idea, we use a simple toy model of a spinless chiral $p+ip$ wave superconductor in three dimensions.\nThe Hamiltonian is,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{\\bm{k}^2-k_F^2}{2m} & \\Delta_0 (k_x-ik_y) \\\\\n\\Delta_0 (k_x+ik_y) & -\\frac{\\bm{k}^2-k_F^2}{2m}\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\n\\label{eq:weyl0}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $k_F$ the Fermi wave-number, and $\\Delta_0 >0$.\nThere are two point nodes of the superconducting gap at $(0,0,k_F)$ and $(0,0,-k_F)$.\nThe Bogoliubov quasiparticle excitations from the point nodes have $\\bm{k}$-linear energy dispersion which mimics \nmassless Dirac fermions in three dimensions. \nA low-energy effective Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})$ for the nodal excitation from the point node at $(0,0,k_F)$ can be written in the form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})=v_xk_x\\tau_x+v_yk_y\\tau_y+v_z(k_z-k_{F})\\tau_z, \n\\label{eq:weyl1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\bm{\\tau}=(\\tau_x,\\tau_y,\\tau_z)$  are the Pauli matrices for the particle-hole space, $v_{x,y,z}$ is the velocity in the $x,y,z$ direction. \nIt noted that $v_{x,y,z}>0$,\nThus, we can adiabatically change the values of $v_{x,y,z}$ to satisfy $v_{x}=v_y=v_z=1$ without changing the topological features explained below. \nThen, eq.(\\ref{eq:weyl1}) is recast into \n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})=\\bm{\\tau}\\cdot(\\bm{k}-\\bm{k}_p),\n\\label{eq:h-weyl1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})=\\bm{\\tau}\\cdot(\\bm{k}-\\bm{k}_{p}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u210b</mi><mo>+</mo></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udf49</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc8c</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02726.tex", "nexttext": "\nIn this form, the direction of \"the magnetic field\" in the momentum space is reversed compared to eq.(\\ref{eq:h-weyl1}), and then,\nthe monopole charge at $\\bm{k}=-\\bm{k}_p$ is $q_m=-1$.\nWe would like to stress again that the monopole charge, which is a topological quantity, is not changed as long as the signs of the velocity\n$v_{x,y,z}$ are not changed.\nIf these point nodes are not degenerated, and the point nodes have the definite monopole charge, we call the nodal excitations from the point nodes\nas Weyl fermions. A Weyl fermion is a gapless Dirac fermion with a definite chirality. The monopole charge mentioned above \ncorresponds to the chirality of the Weyl fermion.\nWeyl superconductors are characterized by the existence of Weyl fermions as nodal excitations, which carry monopole charges\nin the momentum space.\nThis state is a superconducting analogue of the Weyl semimetal state, for which \nWeyl fermions are realized by closing the energy gap of a topological insulator via time-reversal-symmetry breaking \nor inversion-symmetry breaking fields.\\cite{balents2,balents3}\n\nGenerally, Weyl fermions with opposite chirality (i.e. opposite sign of the monopole charge) should appear in pair in Weyl superconductors,\nbecause, in the periodic Brillouin zone, the \"magnetic flux\" generated from the monopole with $q_m=+1$ must be absorbed\ninto the anti-monopole with $q_m=-1$.\\cite{nielsen-ninomiya}\n\nThe nonzero monopole charge associated with the Weyl point leads to a remarkable consequence; the existence of Fermi arc on \na surface of a sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n\nTo explain this phenomenon, we note again that\nthe  \"magnetic flux\" generated from the monopole at $\\bm{k}=\\bm{k}_p$ is absorbed into the anti-monopole at $\\bm{k}=-\\bm{k}_p$.\nThis implies that there is a \"magnetic field\" oriented in the direction $-\\bm{k}_p$ in the momentum space. \nThe \"magnetic field\" in the momentum space is the Berry curvature, and its integral over the two-dimensional Brillouin zone on\na plane perpendicular to  $\\bm{k}_p $ is the 1st Chern number (TKNN number). \nThe nonzero Chern number in the 2D momentum space results in\nthe existence of gapless chiral edge states on the surface of the system. Thus, there is a gapless chiral excitation on the surface of\nthe sample parallel to $\\bm{k}_p $  (see Figure \\ref{fig:weyl}). This chiral zero-energy state exists on a line segment connecting two $\\bm{k}$-points on\nthe surface Brillouin zone, which are the projection of the points $\\pm \\bm{k}_p$ onto the surface Brillouin zone.\nThe line segment of the surface zero-energy state is called the Fermi arc.\nThis chiral state consists of Bogoliubov quasiparticles, and hence the zero energy states are Majorana fermions.\nSince the chiral state is in analogy with chiral edge state of the quantum Hall effect state and two-dimensional chiral superconductors, \nit gives rise to distinct transport phenomena such as thermal Hall effect without applied magnetic field,\nas discussed in section \\ref{sec:thermal}. \nThe anomalous thermal Hall conductivity for the above model of a Weyl superconductor, (\\ref{eq:weyl0}), is given by three-dimensional version of eq.(\\ref{thermalHall});\nthe sum $\\sum_{k}$ is taken over the three-dimensional Brillouin zone.\nIn the low temperature limit $k_{\\rm B}T \\ll \\Delta$, it is given by,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}=\\sum_{k_z}C_1(k_z)\\frac{\\pi k_{\\rm B}^2T}{12\\hbar},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $C_1(k_z)$ is the 1st Chern number defined on the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane for a fixed $k_z$.\nAs mentioned in section \\ref{sec:thermal}, its magnitude is very small $\\kappa_{xy}^{tr}\\sim 10^{-4} T$ (W/Km).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{weyl-figure.eps}\n\\caption{\nPoint nodes at the north and south poles on the spherical Fermi surface are Weyl points, which possess\nthe monopole charges $q_m=+1$ and $-1$, respectively. \n There appears the Majorana Fermi arc in the surface Brillouin zone which is parallel to $k_z$-axis. \nThe Fermi arc is terminated at\ntwo points which are the projection of the bulk Weyl points onto the surface Brillouin.\nIn the bulk, the 1st Chern number on the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane for fixed $k_z$ satisfying $-k_F < k_z <k_F$ is nonzero, $C=1$.\nOn the other hand that for fixed $k_z$ with $|k_z|>k_F$ is zero, $C=0$.\n}\n\\label{fig:weyl}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Particle-hole symmetry}\n\nWeyl superconductors are different from Weyl semimetals in that they possess particle-hole symmetry. Here, we will discuss\nhow the particle-hole symmetry imposes constraints on Weyl fermions.\nLet us suppose that a Weyl fermion is realized as a nodal excitation of a spin-triplet superconductor.\nThe particle-hole transformation operator for spin-triplet pairing states is $\\mathcal{C}=\\tau_xK$ with $K$ the complex conjugate operation.\nThen, we see,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n-\\mathcal{C}\\mathcal{H}_{+}(-\\bm{k})\\mathcal{C}^{-1}=\\mathcal{C}\\bm{\\tau}\\mathcal{C}^{-1}\\cdot (\\bm{k}+\\bm{k}_p).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nNote that $\\mathcal{C}\\bm{\\tau}\\mathcal{C}^{-1}\\cdot \\bm{k}=-\\bm{\\tau}\\cdot\\bm{k}$ up to the\ngauge transformation changing the phase of the superconducting gap by $\\pi$, which flips the sign of the off-diagonal component of \n$\\bm{\\tau}\\cdot\\bm{k}$.\nThus, the particle-hole tranformation changes $\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})$ to $\\mathcal{H}_{-}(\\bm{k})$; i.e.\nthe particle-hole symmetry partners of the monopole in Weyl superconductors is the anti-monopole.\n\nIn the case of spin-singlet superconductors, the particle-hole transformation operator is changed to $i\\tau_y K$.\nHowever, the above result also holds for the spin-singlet pairing case.\n\n\\subsection{Breaking time-reversal symmetry is necessary}\n\nWe now consider a role of time-reversal symmetry for the realization of Weyl superconductors.\nApplying time-reversal symmetry operation $\\mathcal{T}=i\\sigma_y K$ to $\\mathcal{H}_{+}(\\bm{k})$ which possesses\nthe monopole charge $qm=+1$ at $\\bm{k}=\\bm{k}_p$, we obtain,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{T}\\mathcal{H}_{+}(-\\bm{k})\\mathcal{T}^{-1}=-\\bm{\\tau}^{*}\\cdot (\\bm{k}+\\bm{k}_p).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nNote that the right-hand side has the monopole charge $q_m=+1$ at $\\bm{k}=-\\bm{k}_p$,  because \nthe complex conjugate operation of $\\bm{\\tau}$\nchange the sign of the monopole charge. \nAlso, as shown above, the particle-hole symmetry ensures the existence of Weyl fermions with the monopole charge $qm=-1$ at $\\bm{k}=-\\bm{k}_p$,\nwhich is expressed by $\\mathcal{H}_{-}(\\bm{k})$.\nThus, there are two Weyl fermions with opposite chiralities at $\\bm{k}=-\\bm{k}_p$; i.e.\nthey form a Dirac fermion represented by a four-component spinor.\nSimilarly, the time-reversal symmetry operation of $\\mathcal{H}_{-}(\\bm{k})$\nleads to a Weyl fermion with the monopole charge $q_m=-1$ at $\\bm{k}=\\bm{k}_p$.\nHence,\nthe nodal excitations from the point nodes are not Weyl but Dirac fermions.\nIt is necessary to break time-reversal symmetry for the realization of Weyl superconductors.\n\nIt is noted that in the case with time-reversal symmetry, there are helical Fermi arc on the surface of the system, which consists of\ntwo chiral Fermi arc with opposite chiralities.  \nThis state may be referred to as a Dirac superconductivity.\\cite{fang}\n\n\n   \n\\subsection{Candidate materials}\n\nAs already discussed in section \\ref{sec:materials}, there are several candidate systems for Weyl superconductors. \n\n{\\it (i) A-phase of $^3$He :}  The model Hamiltonian (\\ref{eq:weyl0}) is realized in the A-phase of the superfluid Helium 3 up to the spin degeneracy; i.e. $\\Delta_{\\uparrow\\uparrow}(\\bm{k})=\\Delta_{\\downarrow\\downarrow}(\\bm{k})=\\Delta_0 (k_x+ik_y)$.\n The spin degeneracy is trivial in this case, and the monopole charge at each Weyl points is simply doubled.\n The chiral anomaly associated with Weyl fermions in the A-phase of $^3$He was verified by  the measurement of forces acting on vortices.\\cite{bevan,volovik}\n\n{\\it (ii) URu$_2$Si$_2$ : } As discussed in section \\ref{sec:materials}, the heavy fermion superconductor  URu$_2$Si$_2$ has the gap\nfunction with chiral $d_{zx}+id_{yz}$ wave symmetry;  $\\Delta (\\bm{k})=\\Delta_0 k_z(k_x+ik_y)$.\nIt has point nodes at the north and south poles on the Fermi surface. \nOn the surface of the system parallel to the $z$-axis, there appears Majorana arc which connects the projected points\nof the two Weyl points at the north and south poles on the Fermi surface.\nAlthough there is a horizontal line node at $k_z=0$, it does not affect the Majorana arc except just at $k_z=0$.\nSince this is a spin-singlet pairing state, there is spin degeneracy, which gives a trivial $2$ factor to the monopole charge.\nUp to the spin degeneracy, the monopole charges at the nodal points are $q_m=\\pm 1$.\\cite{URu2Si2-2,gos}\n\n{\\it (iii) B-phase of UPt$_3$ : } As mentioned in section \\ref{sec:materials}, there is controversy on the pairing state of\nthe B-phase of the heavy fermion superconductor UPt$_3$. There are three candidate pairing state; $E_{1u}$ planar state, $E_{1u}$ chiral state, and $E_{2u}$ chiral state. Among them, the $E_{1u}$ and $E_{2u}$ chiral states realize Weyl superconducting states.\nThe $E_{1u}$ chiral state is characterized by the $\\bm{d}$-vector, $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b) (5k_c-k^2)$, \nthe chiral part of which is the same as the chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry.\nOn the other hand,  the $\\bm{d}$-vector of the $E_{2u}$ chiral state is $\\bm{d}(\\bm{k})\\propto \\bm{c}(k_a+ik_b)^2k_c$,\nthe chiral part of which is equivalent to the chiral $d$-wave pairing symmetry.\nThere is also trivial spin degeneracy in both cases.\nUp to the spin degeneracy, the point nodes of the $E_{1u}$ ( $E_{2u}$ ) chiral state have the monopole charges $q_m=\\pm 1$ ($2$).\nIn the case of the $E_{2u}$ chiral state, there are two Majorana arcs on the surface of the system parallel to the $c$-axis.\\cite{goswami}\n\n{\\it (iv) UCoGe :} In the heavy fermion system UCoGe, spin-triplet superconductivity coexists with ferromagnetism below $T_c\\sim 0.6 $K.\\cite{UCoGe1,UCoGe2,UCoGe3,UCoGe4}\nAccording to group theoretical argument, there are two possible spin-triplet pairing states in the ferromagnetic phase of UCoGe : \n(a) The $A$-phase with the $\\bm{d}$-vector $\\bm{d}\\sim (a_1k_a+ia_2k_b, a_3k_b+ia_4 k_a,0)$, which possesses\npoint nodes of the superconducting gap at $k_a=k_b=0$, (b) The $B$-phase with the $\\bm{d}$-vector $\\bm{d}\\sim (b_1k_c+ib_2k_ak_bk_c, ib_3k_c+b_4 k_ak_bk_c,0)$ which possesses a line node of the gap.\\cite{mineev}\nThe NMR measurement carried out by Hattori et al. revealed that the pairing glue of this system is the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation.\\cite{hattori}\nA microscopic calculation of the upper critical field for the $A$-phase successfully explains unusual behaviors of the upper critical fields\nof this system, supporting strongly the realization of the $A$-phase in UCoGe.\\cite{hattori}\nThe $A$-phase of this system is indeed the Weyl superconducting state, in which time-reversal symmetry is broken by the $\\bm{d}$-vector; i.e. the non-unitary pairing state. The spin degeneracy is completely lifted by the exchange splitting of the Fermi surface.\nThus, the point-nodal quasiparticle excitations of the $A$-phase behave as genuine Weyl fermions.\n\n\\subsection{Supercondcuting doped Weyl semimetals}\n \nAn interesting realization of a Weyl superconductor is a superconducting\ndoped Weyl semimetal.\\cite{cho,bolu,yi} \nUpon slight doping, Weyl semimetals have disconnected Fermi\nsurfaces, each of which surrounds one of the band-touching\nWeyl points.\nFor time-reversal breaking Weyl semimetals,\na uniform superconducting state on the Fermi surface is found to support\nbulk gap point nodes even for a constant $s$-wave pairing state.\\cite{cho}\nThe existence of point nodes in an $s$-wave state is due to the non-zero\nChern number of Weyl points in the normal state:\\cite{bolu,yi,murakami}\nFor time-reversal breaking Weyl semimetals, \na surface Fermi arc does not have a partner arc with opposite surface\nmomentum, so it cannot participate in a Cooper pair even in an $s$-wave\nsuperconducting state. As a result, the Fermi arc remains gapless in the\nsuperconducting state, so there must be point nodes at which the Fermi\narc terminates.\\cite{bolu}  \nThe Fermi arc in the normal state make it possible to support an exotic\nsurface state with symmetry protected crossed flat bands in the\nsuperconducting state.\\cite{bolu} \n\n\\section{Concluding remarks}\n \nWe make some remarks on recent development which is not discussed in the main text.      \nExperimental exploration for Majorana fermions in topological superconductors is still an important open issue.\nIn particular, the experimental realization of the non-Abelian statistics, which opens a door to future application to topological quantum computation, is one of the most crucial and challenging subjects.\nToward this goal, we still need to develop our theoretical understanding on distinct phenomena\nraised by Majorana fermions in topological superconductors, which can be utilized for experimental detection.\nFrom this perspective, it is important to investigate non-adiabatic\ndynamics of Majorana fermions and related decoherence phenomena of\nMajorana qubits. Recently, there are some advances in this\ndirection.\\cite{majorana-dynamics1,majorana-dynamics2,majorana-dynamics3,majorana-dynamics4,majorana-dynamics5,amorim,\nmajorana-dynamics6}\n\nEffects of superconducting fluctuations on Majorana fermion states have been also studied recently.\\cite{fid-fisher,halperin,altman}\nIt was revealed that the topological degeneracy associated with Majorana fermions is maintained even for the case of quasi-long-range order with power law decay of superconducting correlation, for which the total electron charge is conserved, and the phase of the superconducting gap fluctuates.\n\nAnother important issue is the investigation on interaction effects which is discussed in sec. \\ref{sec:interaction}.\nIn particular, it is possible that novel topological phases emerge on surface of topological superconductors because of interaction effects.\\cite{fidkow3,wang, metlitski}\nExploration for such novel states arising from interaction effects, which can not be realized\nin non-interacting systems, is an important future issue.\n\nIn sec. \\ref{sec:thermal} of this paper, we discussed thermal responses in topological superconductors.\nThis subject is related to the issue of effective field theories which describe topological responses of superconductors.\n It is known that \nfor three-dimensoinal topological insulators, topological field theory is the Axion electromagnetism action.\\cite{Qi-Hughes-Zhang}\nIt was proposed that thermal responses of topological superconductors are described by gravitational field theory analogous to the Axion action.\\cite{ryu-ludwig,wang-zhang}\nHowever, it has turned out that the bulk gravitational field theory can not describe the thermal Hall effect of topological superconductors\ncorrectly, and that thermal responses characterizing topological features are attributed to the existence of gapless edge states; i.e. bulk-edge correspondence is not apparent in thermal responses\\cite{stone,read-grav}\nAlso, it was recently clarified that thermal responses are successfully described by gravitational theory with torsion,\nwhich is not included in the conventional theory of gravity.\\cite{shitade,abanov}\n\n\\begin{acknowledgment}\n\n\nThe authors thank Y.
