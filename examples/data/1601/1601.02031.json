piezoelectric sensors~\\cite{Yun02p447,Chen07p553,Buessem66p33,Karaki07p7035}.\nTherefore, it is of great significance to investigate and understand the structural and electronic properties of BaTiO$_3$ for designed material optimization and device engineering. \nFirst--principles density functional theory (DFT) has served as a powerful method to understand the electronic structures of ferroelectric materials~\\cite{Cohen92p65,Gonze97p10355,Saha00p8828,Kolpak08p036102,Martirez12p256802,Morales14p4465}.\nDue to the expensive computational cost, the application of DFT methods is currently limited to system of fairly small size at zero Kelvin. \nMany important dynamical properties, such as domain wall motions and temperature--driven phase transitions, are beyond the capability of conventional first--principles methods. \nAn effective Hamiltonian method was developed to study finite--temperature properties of BaTiO$_3$~\\cite{Zhong94p1861,Zhong95p6301,Nishimatsu08p104104,Fu03p257601}.\nTo apply this method, the subset of dynamical modes that determine a specific property should be known {\\em a priori}. \nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations with an atomistic potential accounting for all the modes offer distinct advantages,\nespecially in providing detailed information about atomic positions, velocities and modifications of chemical bonds due to a chemical reaction or thermal excitation. \nThe shell model for BaTiO$_3$ has been developed~\\cite{Tinte99p9679,Tinte01p235403,Tinte00p41,Zhang10p015701,Zhang09p405703}. \nHowever, due to the low mass assigned to the shell, a small time step in MD simulations is required to achieve accurate results, which limits the time and length scales of the simulations. \\\\\n\nRecently, we developed a bond--valence (BV) model potential for oxides based on the bond valence theory~\\cite{Grinberg02p909,Shin08p015224,Shin05p054104,Liu13p102202,Liu13p104102}.\nThe force fields for many technologically important ferroelectric materials, PbTiO$_3$, PbZrO$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$~\\cite{Liu13p102202,Liu13p104102,Shin05p054104,Grinberg02p909,Chen15p6371},\nhave been parameterized based on results from DFT calculations. \nA typical force field requires no more than 15 parameters and can be efficiently implemented, \nwhich enables simulations of systems with thousands of atoms under periodic boundary conditions~\\cite{Liu13p232907,Xu15p79}. \nThe development of an accurate classical potential for BaTiO$_3$ has proven to be difficult, \nmainly due to the small energy differences among the four phases (rhombohedral, orthorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic)~\\cite{Kwei93p2368,Dieguez04p212101,Von50p221}. \nIn this paper, we apply the bond--valence model to BaTiO$_3$ and parameterize the all--atom interatomic potential to first--principles data. \nOur model potential for BaTiO$_3$ is able to reproduce the rhombohedral--orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic (R-O-T-C) phase transition sequence in isobaric--isothermal ensemble ($NPT$) MD simulations. \nThe phase transition temperatures agree reasonably well with previous theoretical results~\\cite{Tinte99p9679}.  \nWe further examine the temperature dependence of the local displacements of Ti atoms and discover several features of the phase transitions of BaTiO$_3$:\nthe phase transitions of BaTiO$_3$ involve both order--disorder and displacive characters;\nat the moment that the phase transition of the crystal occurs, all the polarization components undergo phase transitions, even for the nonpolar ones;\nand temperature increase can also cause bond--hardening for a certain component. \n\n\\section{Methods}\n\nThe bond--valence model potential is developed based on the conservation principles of bond valence and bond--valence vector. \nThe bond valence, $V_{ij}$, reflects the bonding strength and can be calculated based on the bond length, $r_{ij}$, with~\\cite{Brown09p6858,Grinberg02p909,Brown73p266,Brown76p1957,Liu13p102202,Liu13p104102,Shin08p015224,Shin05p054104}\n\n", "index": 1, "text":

The final average difference between DFT energy and model--potential energy is 1.35 meV/atom.\n\n\n\\section{Performance of the classical potential}\n\nThe optimized parameters are listed in TABLE~\\ref{t1}. \nThe performance of the obtained force field is examined by investigating the temperature dependence of lattice constants ($a$, $b$ and $c$), \ncomponent--resolved local displacements of Ti atoms ($d_x$, $d_y$, and $d_z$), and the three components of the total polarization ($P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$).\nWe carry out $NPT$ MD simulations using a 10$\\times$10$\\times$10 supercell (5000 atoms) with the temperature controlled via the Nos{\\'e}--Hoover thermostat\nand the pressure maintained at 1 atm via the Parrinello--Rahman barostat~\\cite{Parrinello80p1196}.\nAs shown in FIG.~\\ref{f2}, the simulations clearly reveal four distinct phases under different temperature ranges and three first--order phase transitions. \nBelow 100~K, the displacements of Ti atoms and the overall polarization of the supercell are along [111] direction ($P_x=P_y=P_z$), characteristic of the rhombohedral phase. \nAt 100~K, the $z$ component of the total polarization, $P_z$, becomes approximately 0, indicating a phase transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic ($P_x=P_y>0$, $P_z=0$).\nAs the temperature increases further to 110 K, the total polarization aligns preferentially along $x$ direction ($P_x>0$, $P_y=P_z=0$) and the lattice constants have $b=c<a$. \nThe supercell stays tetragonal until 160 K at which point the ferroelectric--paraelectric phase transition occurs. \nThe phase transition temperatures match well with those predicted by the shell model~\\cite{Tinte99p9679} (TABLE~\\ref{t2}).\nThe underestimation of Curie temperature $T_C$ in MD simulations has been observed previously and is likely due to the systematic error of density functional used for force field optimization~\\cite{Liu13p102202,Sepliarsky05p014110}. \nWe extract the averaged lattice constants at finite temperatures from MD simulations and find that they are in good agreement (error less than 1$\\%$) with the PBEsol values (TABLE~\\ref{t3}). \n\nDomain walls are interfaces separating domains with different polarities. They are important topological defects and can be moved by applying external stimulus~\\cite{Liu13p232907,Xu15p79}. \nThe domain wall energy for a 180$^{\\circ}$ wall obtained from our MD simulations is 6.63 mJ/m${^2}$, \nwhich is comparable to PBEsol value, 7.84 mJ/m$^2$. This indicates that our atomistic potential can be used for studying the dynamics of ferroelectric domain walls in BaTiO$_3$.\nAll these results demonstrate the robustness of this developed classical potential.\n\n\\section{Atomistic features of different phases}\n\nTo provide an atomistic description of the different phases of BaTiO$_3$, \nwe analyze the distribution of local displacements of Ti atoms in each phase.\nTi displacement is defined as the distance between the Ti atom and the center of the oxygen octahedral cage of a unit cell,\nwhich scales with the magnitude of polarization.\n\nIn FIG.~\\ref{f3} (a), we plot the distributions of Ti displacements ($d=\\sqrt{d_x^2+d_y^2+d_z^2}$). \nIt can be seen that in all four phases, the distribution is approximately a Gaussian curve whose peak shifts toward lower values as the temperature increases. \nThis suggests that the temperature--driven phase transition has a displacive character. \nIt is noted that the distribution of magnitudes is peaked at non--zero value even in the paraelectric cubic phase, \nsuggesting that most Ti atoms are still locally displaced at high temperature, and that the overall net zero polarization is the result of an isotropic distribution of local dipoles along different directions.\nThis confirms the order--disorder character for BaTiO$_3$ at high temperature. \n\nWe can categorize the phase of each unit cell based on the local displacement of Ti atom. The categorization criteria are\\\\\n(1) If $d<0.1$ \\AA, the unit cell is considered to be paraelectric cubic;\\\\\n(2) For a ferroelectric unit cell, the $k$--th component is considered to be ferroelectric if $d_k > d/\\sqrt{6}$. The rhombohedral, orthorhombic, and tetragonal unit cells have three, two, and one ferroelectric component(s), respectively. \\\\\n\\noindent The results are shown in FIG.~\\ref{f3} (b). \nAt 30 K, the supercell is made only from rhombohedral unit cells, showing that the rhombohedral phase is the ground--state structure. As the temperature increases, the supercell becomes a mixture of the four phases. \nIt should be noted that the cubic unit cell with nearly--zero local Ti displacement seldom appears, because a cubic unit cell is energetically less favorable. \nThe relative energies of the four phases of BaTiO$_3$ from PBEsol DFT calculations are listed in TABLE~\\ref{t5}. \nIt can be seen that the energy differences between the tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral unit cells are small (within several meV per unit cell)~\\cite{Cohen90p6416,Cohen92p65}. \nDue to the thermal fluctuations, the populations of higher--energy ferroelectric phases (tetragonal and orthorhombic) increase as temperature increases.\nAbove the ferroelectric--paraelectric  transition temperature,  locally ferroelectric unit cells are still favored over paraelectric due to the relatively high energy of cubic, the high--symmetry structure.  \n\nIn FIG.~\\ref{f4}, the distributions of Ti displacements along the three axes are plotted. \nAt 100 K, BaTiO$_3$ is at the rhombohedral phase and the distributions of Ti displacements are Gaussian--like.\nAs the temperature increases, the phase changes to orthorhombic.\nThe average of the $x$ polarization component shifts to zero, indicating a displacive phase transition.\nBesides, the standard deviation increases and the center of the distribution curve becomes flatter.\nFor the cubic phase, the center of the Ti displacement distribution curve is also flat.\nAs shown in FIG.~\\ref{fadd}, the center--flat curve is a summation of a Gaussian curve centering at zero, \nand a double--peak curve. The latter is characteristic of order--disorder transition~\\cite{Liu13p232907}.\nThese results further demonstrate that phase transitions of BaTiO$_3$ have a mix of order--disorder and displacive characters~\\cite{Gaudon15p6,Ehses81p507,Jun88p2255,Comes68p715,Itoh85p29,Stern04p037601,Kwei93p2368}. \n\n\\section{Features of the phase transitions}\nTo investigate the structural dynamics during phase transitions in more detail, we conducted MD simulations with varying temperatures. \nIn three different sets of simulations, the temperatures were increased from 100 K to 110 K (R to O), 110 K to 120 K (O to T) and 155 K to 165 K (T to C) respectively.\nThe temperature was controlled by the Nos{\\'e}--Hoover thermostat with a thermal inertia parameter $M_s$=10 and the 10 K temperature change was accomplished in 60 ps.\nWe analyze the temperature dependence of Ti displacement distributions along three axes.\nThe dynamics of Ti displacement distributions during the phase transitions are plotted in FIG.~\\ref{f5}.\nThe time evolution of the average and standard deviation of the Ti displacement distributions are shown in FIG.~\\ref{f6}.\n\nPhase transition occurs when one component undergoes polar--nonpolar transition.\nThe first column (from 100 K to 110 K) shows the changes of Ti displacement distributions during the rhombohedral to orthorhombic phase transition.\nIn the $x$ and $y$ direction, the averages of the distribution shift up, which is a characteristic of displacive transition. \nMeanwhile, in the $z$ direction, the average becomes zero and the variance becomes significantly larger, indicating that the transition is a mix of displacive and bond--softening characters~\\cite{Gaffney07p1444}.\nFor the orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition (second column), \nthe transition of the $y$ component, which is a polar--nonpolar transition, includes both displacive and bond--softening features.\nFor the $x$ component, the transition involves both an increase of the average\nand a decrease of the standard deviation.\nFor the $z$ direction, even though the Ti displacement distribution is centered at zero above and below the transition,\nthe Ti displacements are located closer to zero, indicating an increase in bond hardness. \nFrom 155 K to 165 K, there is also a bond--hardness--changing transition for the components ($x$ and $y$) with zero averages.\nWe collectively refer to `bond--softening' and `bond--hardening' as `bond--hardness--changing'.\n\nBased on the features of the Ti displacement distributions at different phases,\nthe schematic representation of the thermal excitation between different energy surfaces is presented in FIG.~\\ref{f7}.\nFrom our results, the characteristics of BaTiO$_3$ phase transition can be summarized as:\n(1) For BaTiO$_3$, the mechanisms of phase transitions include both bond--hardness--changing and displacive transition.\nThe sudden shifts of the average and standard deviation correspond to displacive with some order--disorder contribution and bond--hardness--changing transitions respectively;\n(2) Unlike the conventional understanding that thermal excitation usually causes bond--softening, \nincreasing temperature can also cause bond hardening.\nThe $x$ component of polarization during the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition is an example of this case.\n\n(3) When the phase transition occurs, each component of polarization undergoes a change,\neven for the component(s) which is(are) non--polar before and after the transition.\nThe transition(s) that each component undergoes are listed in TABLE~\\ref{t6}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIn this work, we develop a classical atomistic potential for BaTiO$_3$ based on the bond valence model. \nMolecular dynamics simulation with this optimized potential can not only reproduce the temperature--driven phase transitions, \nbut can also be a powerful tool in studying the phase transition process with high temporal and spatial resolutions.  \nThe detailed analysis of the local displacements of Ti atoms reveals that in each phase (including the paraelectric phase),\nthe majority of Ti atoms are locally displaced, and the phase transitions in BaTiO$_3$ exhibit a mixture of order--disorder and displacive character.\nThe distribution of Ti displacement is a Gaussian curve or a curve involving a Gaussian and a double peak one. \nBoth the average and standard deviation are features of each specific phase, and they can be the order parameters for describing the Gibbs free energy. \nBy analyzing the dynamics of Ti displacement distributions during phase transition, we discover several rules of BaTiO$_3$ phase transitions:\nthe global phase transition is associated with significant changes in each component, even for the components which are nonpolar, \nand the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition exhibits a bond--hardening character in the $z$ component, \nwhich is opposite to the conventional understanding that temperature increase generally causes bond--softening transition. \n\n\n\\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}\nY.Q. was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, under
