Among them the nucleon-dueteron (Nd) scattering has been widely investigated. Experiments at KVI in Groningen, at KUTL/RIKEN/RCNP in Japan, and at IUCF in USA have provided large sets of high-precision data \\cite{nass} (and references therein), not only for the cross-sections but also for the polarization observables. Tremendous progress has been made to understand the 3N dynamics. With the new high-precision data, covering a large phase-space, it has become possible to pin-down the effects as subtle as three-nucleon forces (3NF) \\cite{glock, epel}. The experimental program at KVI has been carried out to extent those studies to the breakup reaction. It used initially the SALAD detector \\cite{salad} later upgraded to the BINA detector setup \\cite{bina}, covering even larger phase-space and with better detection capabilities. The experiments with SALAD and BINA alone filled up a large gap in the 3N data-base, not only Nd elastic scattering but also breakup reaction~\\cite{nass, kistryn2013}. The next step for the experimental program was to move forward in the sector of four-nucleon (4N) system, where the knowledge is scarce in both the theoretical as well as the experimental domains \\cite{deltu2}. The 3NF effect is expected to be enhanced in 4N system, that makes the study of 4N even more attractive. \n\n\\section{Experiment}\nThe BINA detector is a 4$\\pi$ apparatus designed for few-nucleon scattering \nexperiments at intermediate energies. BINA is divided into two main parts, \nforward wall ($\\theta$: 13$^\\circ$- 40$^\\circ$) and backward ball \n($\\theta$: 40$^\\circ$- 165$^\\circ$). The forward wall consists of (a) multi-wire \nproportional chamber (for reconstruction of angles of the scattered charged \nparticles), (b) 24 vertical thin plastic scintillator \\lq stripes\\rq, and (c) 10 \nhorizontal thick plastic scintillator \\lq slabs\\rq. The plastic stripes and slabs \nform 240 $\\Delta$E-E telescopes for particle identification. The backward ball \nis nearly spherically symmetric, and made up of 149 triangular phoswich \ndetector elements. These elements are arranged in such a way that the formed geometry of the ball resembles to that of a soccer ball. The ball at the same time plays the role of the reaction chamber\n as well as the detector. The work presented here is based on the experiment performed at KVI in Groningen, the Netherlands, with BINA detector, where an unpolarized beam of deuterons with an energy of 160 MeV was provided from AGOR cyclotron to impinge upon liquid hydrogen and liquid deuterium targets.\n\\section{Data Analysis and Sample Results}\nThe most basic data analysis steps, in forward scattering (wall) region of BINA, such as particle identification, energy calibration and cross-section evaluation were already described in our previous work~\\cite{khatri_fb, khatri_epj, parol_epj}. For the data collected in the backward scattering (ball) region, the analysis task was difficult and challenging. This was mainly due to the lack of light tightness of the ball elements, which resulted in additional contributions from the neighboring elements to the registered signal, i.e. a particle was registered in the ball with more than one element responding. Contribution of such events was significant and could not be neglected.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{relative_phi}}\n\\caption[]{The distribution of elastically scattered wall-ball coincident deuterons is presented as a function of their relative azimuthan angle. The peaks are centered around $\\pm$180$^{\\circ}$ and the width of the peaks represents the angular resolution of the detector. Clusterization (the gray/red curve) led to an improvement in the angular resolution as compared to analysis performed without clusterization (the black curve).}\n\\label{cluster_angle}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}{.5\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{noclust_BW2}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}{.5\\textwidth}\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{clust_BW2}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{A correlation between polar angles of wall ($\\theta_{wall}$) and ball ($\\theta_{ball}$) is presented for the wall-ball coincidence of the two elastically scattered deuterons. Left panel represents before applying the clusterization and the right after. \n}\\label{wb_theta_clust}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTherefore to reconstruct a particle emission angle and energy, a cluster instead of a single element was considered in the further analysis. In an ideal situation, where the ball elements would have been perfectly light-tight, the emission angles ($\\theta$, $\\phi$) of a detected charged particle in the i$^{th}$ ball element would be taken at the centroid of that ball element, i.e. $\\theta$ = $\\theta_{i}$  and $\\phi$ = $\\phi_{i}$ --- these are the angles before applying clusterization. A given cluster is characterized with its azimuthal $\\phi_{c}$ and polar $\\theta_{c}$ angles and its energy $E_{c}$. The $\\phi_{c}$ and $\\theta_{c}$ are calculated as weighted average of the angles of the cluster elements as follows:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{clust_eqn1}\n\\phi_{c}=\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\phi_{i}E_{i}}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n E_{i}}\\hspace{1cm} and,\\hspace{1cm} \n\n\n\\theta_{c}=\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\theta_{i}E_{i}}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n E_{i}}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\phi_{c}=\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\phi_{i}E_{i}}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}E_{i}}%&#10;\\hskip 28.452756ptand,\\hskip 28.452756pt\\par&#10;\\par&#10;\\theta_{c}=\\frac{\\sum\\limits%&#10;_{i=1}^{n}\\theta_{i}E_{i}}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}E_{i}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><mrow><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003\u2003\u2002\u2003</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"31pt\">,</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></munderover><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06846.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $n$ and $i$ have the same meaning as in the Eq.~\\ref{clust_eqn1} and the $E_{max}$ is the energy deposited in a central cluster element where the particle is detected (deposits the largest part of its energy). The estimation of $\\alpha$ was done by looking at cluster events where only two adjacent ball elements responded to the detection of an elastically scattered deuteron, since the deuteron energy was well known (on the basis of the second deuteron angle measured in wall). Investigation performed for several sample elements showed that the $\\alpha$ value is approximately 10\\%.

They were subsequently normalized with the use of existing \\textit{dd} elastic scattering data from BBS experiment~\\cite{bailey}. So far we have obtained the cross sections for 147 kinematical configurations (about 4500 data points) in the dd$\\rightarrow$dpn breakup reaction near to quasi-free scattering limit (neutron acting as a spectator). The data, when compared to the state-of-the-art calculations based on Single Scattering Approximation (SSA)~\\cite{deltuva_private_comun}, are well described when the neutron energy is close to zero. We present here only sample cross section distributions, see Fig.~\\ref{sample_results}. The normalization procedure and the full set of obtained cross section results can be found in ~\\cite{khatri_phd}. \n\\section{Conclusion and outlook}\nWe presented a first attempt to precise data analysis of events registered in the ball part of the BINA detector. The obtained cross sections in QFS limit are fairly well described when the spectator neutron energy is small enough. The precise experimental data, so obtained, in a wide phase-space region, can serve as valid tool for verification of rigorous theoretical calculations which have been and are being developed.\\\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\bf{Acknowledgments}}\\\\\nThe author would likes to thank Dr. A.
