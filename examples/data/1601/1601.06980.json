Introduction:}\n\n\n\nThe identification, classification and characterization of \ncollective dynamical states in a population of nonlinearly \ncoupled oscillators is an interesting and old problem\\cite{fermi,strogatz1,waller}. For many of such systems, we are concerned about only the phases of the individual oscillators, especially if the system is composed of limit cycle oscillators. In that case, the phase space dynamics of a single oscillator takes place mainly near a limit cycle and so the amplitude of oscillation can be considered to be practically constant during the time evolution. If we couple a number of such oscillators, then, under certain coupling conditions, these systems may show complete phase-synchronized state. Starting from a random distribution of phases, when the total system synchronizes, its individuals oscillate in time in such a way that their phases are almost equal or distributed over a very narrow range\\cite{strogatz2,rosin,bonilla}. \nApart from being of mathematical interest, these systems are often used \nto model many natural systems which admit spontaneous synchronization by the interaction of their individuals. Some notable examples include collective dynamics of pulse-coupled excitable neurons\\cite{masuda,mirollo}, cardiac dysrhythmias\\cite{supru,Guevara} and spontaneous synchronization of the flashes of fireflies\\cite{strogatz2,strogatz3} among many. \n\nA special class of such problems, the Kuramoto model \nfor coupled phase oscillators is an well-studied problem in nonlinear dynamics\\cite{kuramoto1}.\n The model consists of $N$ coupled phase oscillators whose \nphases $\\theta_{i}$ obey the set of $N$ first-order ordinary \ndifferential equation \n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "$$\\dot{\\theta_{i}}= \\omega_{i}+\\Sigma_{j=1}^{N}K_{ij}sin(\\theta_{j}-\\theta_{i}) \\eqno(1.1)$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\dot{\\theta_{i}}=\\omega_{i}+\\Sigma_{j=1}^{N}K_{ij}sin(\\theta_{j}-\\theta_{i})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a3</mi><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06980.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the floor function $f(x)=\\lfloor x\\rfloor $ implies the greatest integer not exceeding $x$\nand for any $P_i(t+1) > 50$, \n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 8179, "prevtext": "\n\nwith $i=1,2,..,N$ where $\\omega_{i}$ is the natural frequency of oscillation \nof the $i$-th oscillator and the matrix $K$ denotes the coupling between \nthe oscillators.

We have also distinguished the single chimera and multichimera\nstates by the discontinuity measure plot and shown in Fig-3(b). In both plots, the sharp transition to synchronization with varying coupling radius is evident and it is also seen to be independent of the coupling strength $\\epsilon$ for sufficiently large values of $\\epsilon$. Thus the behavior of the order parameter as seen in Fig-2 is generic, for a large range of values of $\\epsilon$. Furthermore, the plots reveal that as the system undergoes the synchronizing transition from the asynchronous state with increasing coupling radius, at first, most of the systems form chimeras, which fragment into multichimeras and then global synchronization sets in. This sequence is perhaps not very counter-intuitive, especially if one considers the fact that the multichimera states have less broken global translational symmetry from the synchronized states when compared to chimera states.\n\nThe phase plot shows some further interesting behavior of the system. In both plots, a fine yet prominent band of chimera and multichimera states are observed near $\\epsilon=0.1$ for almost all, even small values of $r$ which is surrounded by completely asynchronous states. The mechanism for this exceptional clustering of phases at extremely small values of the coupling radius for a very specific coupling strength is yet unknown to us. However, using lattices of various sizes, we have ensured that this behavior is present in all cases, irrespective of lattice sizes and they occur at the same value of $\\epsilon$ in all of them.\n\n\\newpage\n\n\n\nThe phase plot shows some further interesting behavior of the system. In both plots, a fine yet prominent band of chimera and multichimera states are observed near $\\epsilon=0.1$ for almost all, even small values of coupling radius which is surrounded by completely asynchronous states. The phase level population distribution plot Fig-4 reveals this behavior by showing a peak in population for some specific phase levels. Fig-4 also shows that this peakedness of the distribution occurs at a specific value of $\\epsilon$ and is absent at other nearby values, where the almost uniform distribution implies incoherence.  As is evident from the phase plots (Fig-3), this behavior is less prominent for larger values of the coupling radius. The mechanism for this exceptional clustering of phases at extremely small values of the coupling radius for a very specific coupling strength is yet unknown to us. However, using lattices of various sizes, and varied random initial conditions we have ensured that this behavior is present in all cases, irrespective of lattice sizes and they occur at the same value of $\\epsilon$ in all of them. More interestingly, for $l=50$, irrespective of lattice sizes, initial conditions and number of iteration steps, the oscillator phases always tend to take values mostly between two phase levels only, namely, the $10$th and the $20$th level.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c}\n        \\resizebox{10cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=0]{figure8.eps}}\n        \n          \\end{tabular}\n \\caption{Phase Level population Distributions for coupling strengths $\\epsilon=0.05$ (boxes), $\\epsilon=0.12$ (triangles) and $\\epsilon=0.2$ (circles) showing the exceptional multichimera formation at a specific value of the coupling strength, represented by a sharp peak in the distribution.

As the defining property of a cluster in our context, we have demanded that the nearest-neighbor phase deviation $Z_{i}$ inside a cluster cannot have absolute value larger than $0$. With this definition, the clusters size distribution is seen to be a power law with exponent nearly equal to 1.5, as is shown in Fig-5. Furthermore, the power law exponent is independent of the values of the parameters $\\epsilon$ and $r$ as is seen from Fig-5. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c}\n        \\resizebox{10cm}{!}{\\includegraphics[angle=0]{figure9.eps}}\n        \n          \\end{tabular}\n \\caption{Cluster size Distribution of Multichimera states for $\\epsilon=1.0,r=0.4$ (bullets) and $\\epsilon=0.9,r=0.42$ (boxes).

Summary and Future Extensions:}\n\n\n\nIn this article, we have developed a simple cellular automata model of \nnonlinearly coupled oscillators which reveals all essential features of\nsynchronization phenomena. In our simulation, we have observed that\ndepending on the values of coupling strength and radius of coupling we observed\nfour phases namely: asynchronous, where all the oscillators oscillate \nincoherently, chimera, where a single group of connecting oscillators \noscillates coherently and rest oscillates incoherently, the \nmultichimera and synchronized, where all\noscillators oscillates coherently. We have plotted the phase diagram in the\nplane described by strength of coupling and the radius of coupling using the\nstrength of incoherence. Furthermore, the chimera and multichimera \nwere distinguished by discontinuity measure.\n\nThis model can be more generalized to include non-homogeneous coupling strengths and/or extended to other kinds (e.g. quadratic, cubic, broken linear etc.) of nonlinearity in the coupling term. The effect of time-delay in the coupling term can also be studied. The time needed by the system to organize into a chimera state starting from random initial conditions can be studied. Determination of the fate of the chimera state, i.e., whether or not the chimera state synchronizes globally after a sufficiently long time is also an interesting problem. Furthermore, one can also test the model in higher dimensions and other network geometries to explore its dynamical behavior. \n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\begin{center}{\\bf References}\\end{center}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\bibitem{fermi} E.
