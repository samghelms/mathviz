We study\nthe dynamical mass ejection from both quasi-circular and dynamical-capture eccentric\nmergers.  We systematically vary the level of our treatment of the microphysics\nto isolate the effects of neutrino cooling and heating and we compute the\nnucleosynthetic yields of the ejecta. We find that eccentric binaries can eject\nsignificantly more material than quasi-circular binaries and generate bright\ninfrared and radio emission. In all our simulations the outflow is composed of a\ncombination of tidally- and shock-driven ejecta, mostly distributed over a broad\n$\\sim 60^\\circ$ angle from the orbital plane, and, to a lesser extent, by\nthermally driven winds at high latitudes.  Ejecta from eccentric mergers are\ntypically more neutron rich than those of quasi-circular mergers. This is the\neffect of the strong tidal torques exerted on the neutron stars during their\nperiastron passages which leads to the ejection of cold, neutron-rich material.\nWe find neutrino cooling and heating to affect, quantitatively and\nqualitatively, composition, morphology, and total mass of the outflows. This is\nalso reflected in the infrared and radio signatures of the binary. The final\nnucleosynthetic yields of the ejecta are robust and insensitive to input physics\nor merger type in the regions of the second and third r-process peaks. The\nyields for elements on the first peak vary between our simulations, but none of\nour models is able to explain the Solar abundances of first-peak elements\nwithout invoking additional first-peak contributions from either neutrino and\nviscously-driven winds operating on longer timescales after the mergers, or from\ncore-collapse supernovae.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\begin{keywords}\nstars: neutron -- neutrinos -- hydrodynamics -- nuclear reactions,\nnucleosynthesis, abundances -- gravitational waves --  methods: numerical\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nBinary neutron star (BNS)\\acused{BNS}\\acused{NS} and black-hole neutron-star\n(BHNS) \\acused{BH}\\acused{BHNS} mergers can result in the dynamical ejection of\n\\ac{NS} matter due to tidal torques and/or, in the \\ac{BNS} case, shocks during\nthe merger. This neutron-rich material has long been proposed as a possible\norigin for the elements with atomic mass number $A\\gtrsim 120$\n\\citep{lattimer:74, meyer:89, eichler:89, freiburghaus:99}. As the ejecta expand\nand cool they realize the right conditions for the activation of the so-called\nrapid neutron capture process (\\emph{r-process}), synthesizing neutron-rich\nnuclei.\n\nThis scenario has received renewed attention in recent years. On the one hand,\ndetailed calculations have shown that core-collapse supernovae, once considered\nto be the main candidate for the production of the r-process elements, do not\nappear to host the right conditions to create the most neutron-rich nuclei\n\\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{roberts:10, hudepohl:10, fischer:10}. On the other hand, the most\nrecent \\ac{GR} simulations of the mass ejection occurring during \\ac{BNS}\n\\citep{hotokezaka:13, bauswein:13, wanajo:14, sekiguchi:15, kastaun:15,\npalenzuela:15, foucart:15b} and \\ac{BHNS} \\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{foucart:14, kyutoku:15}\nmergers, as well as in the later evolution of the post-merger remnant\n\\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{dessart:09, metzger:14, fernandez:15, foucart:15a, just:15a,\nmartin:15}, suggest that mergers are likely to eject a large amount of r-process\nmaterial \\citep{korobkin:12, wanajo:14, just:15a, martin:15}.\n\nNevertheless, there are some potential problems for galactic chemical evolution\nif compact object binary mergers are the primary source of the r-process.  The\nlarge amount of material ejected per event predicts a larger spread in r-process\nenrichment of metal poor halo stars than what is observed, when using simple\nmodels of galactic chemical evolution \\citep{qian:00, argast:04}.  Additionally,\nthe delay time between binary formation and merger can result in r-process\nnucleosynthesis only occurring at somewhat higher metallicity than it is\nobserved to begin at \\citep{argast:04}.  More recent models of galactic chemical\nevolution performed within cosmological zoom-in simulations \\citep{shen:15,\nvan-de-voort:15}  or by accounting for accretion of sub-halos into the Milky Way\nhalo \\citep{ishimaru:15} find better agreement with the observed distribution of\nr-process elements in the Milky Way, but the results of these models are\nsensitive to numerical resolution and their treatment of mixing.\n\nOn the other hand, the idea that compact binary mergers could be the site of the\nr-process is also tentatively supported by the recent discovery of an infrared\ntransient associated with Swift \\ac{SGRB} 130603B \\mbox{\\citep{berger:13,\ntanvir:13}} that might be explained by the radioactive decay of by-products of\nthe r-process in a \\emph{macronova} (sometimes also called \\emph{kilonova})\n\\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{Li:98, kulkarni:05, metzger:10, roberts:11, kasen:13, barnes:13,\ntanaka:13, rosswog:14, grossman:14, lippuner:15}. Other evidence includes the\nSolar system abundance of $^{244}$Pu \\citep{wallner:15, hotokezaka:15} and\nrecent observations of r-process enriched stars in a metal-poor ultra-faint\ndwarf galaxy \\citep{ji:15}. Both of these observations suggest that r-process\nelements might be preferentially produced in rare/high-yield events such as\nmergers instead of common/low-yield occurrences such as core-collapse\nsupernovae.\n\nBeside powering macronovae, the outflows from \\ac{BNS} and \\ac{BHNS} mergers\ncould also generate radio flares over timescales of months to years as their\nkinetic energy is deposited in the interstellar medium \\citep{nakar:11}, and\ncould explain the extended X-ray emission observed in some \\acp{SGRB}\n\\citep{rezzolla:14, ciolfi:14}. Mergers are also very loud \\ac{GW} sources and\nare among the most promising sources for laser-interferometer \\ac{GW} detectors\n\\citep{sathyaprakash:09} such as advanced LIGO \\citep{advligo}, advanced Virgo\n\\citep{accadia:11}, and KAGRA \\citep{somiya:12}. Finally, \\ac{BNS} and \\ac{BHNS}\nmergers are also thought to create the central engines of \\ac{SGRB}\n\\citep{nakar:07, berger:14, rosswog:15}.  This makes \\ac{BNS} and \\ac{BHNS}\nmergers ideal candidates for multi-messenger astronomy \\citep{metzger:12,\nnissanke:13} and motivates the systematic study of their observational\nsignatures.\n\nMost previous studies of \\ac{BNS} and \\ac{BHNS} mergers focused on the case of\n``primordial'' binaries ({\\textit{i.e.}}, formed in an already bound state) which merge\nunder the effect of \\ac{GW} losses at zero eccentricity. However,\nhigh-eccentricity mergers might also occur in dense stellar environments such as\n\\acp{GC}. About $10\\%$ of all observed \\acp{SGRB} show offsets larger than $20$\nkiloparsecs from the bulge of their host galaxies \\citep{berger:05, berger:14}.\nIn comparison, no long-GRBs have been found with an offset of more than 10\nkiloparsecs from their host galaxies \\citep{berger:14}.  These offsets could be\nthe result of kicks imparted to the binaries at birth, or they could be\nexplained by $10\\%$ of SGRB progenitors being located in \\acp{GC} around their\nhost galaxies \\citep{berger:14}. \\acp{GC} are dense environments (especially\nwhen they undergo the core collapse phase) in which tidal captures, collisions,\nand dynamically formed binaries from two- or three-body interactions become a\nmore viable channel for \\ac{BNS} and \\ac{BHNS} mergers than in the galactic\nstellar field \\citep{lee:10}.\n\nCurrent estimates for the rates of eccentric \\ac{BNS} mergers in \\acp{GC} are\nunfortunately plagued by many uncertainties stemming from unknown properties of\n\\acp{GC}, such as the number of \\acp{NS} in the \\ac{GC} core \\citep{murphy:11}.\nRecently, \\citet{tsang:13} reviewed the estimates for binary collisions and\ntidal captures in \\ac{GC} and arrived at a conservative estimate of $0.5 \\;\n\\text{yr} ^{-1} \\; \\text{Gpc}^{-3}$. However, \\citet{tsang:13} leaves open the\npossibility that neglected contributions, such as the interaction of a single\n\\ac{NS} with a binary system or rarer binary-binary interactions, might increase\nthese rates.  In any case, even under the most optimistic assumptions,\ndynamical-capture \\ac{BNS} mergers would account for only a few percent of the\ntotal \\ac{BNS} merger rate.\n\nNevertheless, eccentric mergers might eject significantly larger amounts of mass\nthan non-eccentric, quasi-circular, mergers \\citep{east:12b, rosswog:13}. As a\nconsequence, they could be contributing an important fraction of the overall\nr-process element abundances, despite being rarer. For the same reason,\neccentric \\ac{BNS} mergers would also give birth to particularly bright \\ac{EM}\nemissions in the infrared and radio bands compared with quasi-circular binaries.\nAdditionally, eccentric \\ac{BNS} mergers produced by dynamical captures in dense\nstellar environments can potentially produce r-process nuclei at very low\nmetallicity and account for the r-process enhancements seen in some carbon\nenhanced metal poor stars \\citep{ramirez-ruiz:15}.\n\nTo date, only few \\ac{GR} studies considered eccentric \\ac{BNS} \\citep{gold:12,\neast:12b, paschalidis:15, east:15b} and \\ac{BHNS} \\citep{stephens:11, east:12a,\neast:15a} mergers. Eccentric mergers were also considered in Newtonian physics\nby \\citet{lee:10} and  \\citet{rosswog:13}. All of these studies, apart from the\nNewtonian simulations of \\citet{rosswog:13}, employed idealized equations of\nstate. No previous study considered eccentric mergers in full-\\ac{GR}, with a\nmicrophysical temperature- and composition-dependent equation of state, and with\nthe inclusion of neutrino emission and absorptions. GR, microphysical \\ac{EOS},\nand neutrinos are three ingredients that are necessary to accurately model the\nmass ejection and the nucleosynthetic yields from these events. Neutrino\ntransport, in particular, has been recently suggested to have an important role\nin shaping the composition of the ejecta by \\citet{wanajo:14, sekiguchi:15,\nfoucart:15a, foucart:15b}.  This, in turn, might affect the nucleosynthetic\nyields \\citep{wanajo:14, goriely:15} and, possibly, the properties of the\nmacronova emission \\citep{metzger:14, lippuner:15}.\n\nThe goal of this paper20160111 is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the\nphysics driving dynamical mass ejection in \\ac{BNS} mergers. On the one hand, we\nquantify the impact of weak reactions and neutrino radiation on the properties\nof the ejecta, including composition and geometry, extending the works of\n\\citet{wanajo:14, sekiguchi:15, foucart:15a, foucart:15b}. On the other hand, we\nstudy, for the first time in full-\\ac{GR} and including a microphysical equation\nof state and neutrino cooling/heating, the mass ejection in eccentric mergers.\n\nToward these goals we perform a series of full-\\ac{GR} simulations of merging\n\\ac{BNS} in eccentric and quasi-circular orbits. For the eccentric mergers, we\nconsider $5$ possible configurations leading to a variety of different outcomes,\nincluding prompt and delayed \\ac{BH} formation, while all our quasi-circular\nsimulations show delayed \\ac{BH} formation. We systematically vary the level of\nsophistication of our microphysical description to isolate the effects of local\nweak reactions (mainly captures on neutrons) and neutrino irradiation from the\nmerger remnant.\n\nThe remainder of this paper20160111 is organized as follows. We discuss our numerical\nmodels, simulation methods, and initial data in Section \\ref{sec:method}. We\npresent our main results in Section~\\ref{sec:results}, while Section\n\\ref{sec:conclusions} is dedicated to discussion and conclusions. Appendix\n\\ref{sec:M0} describes our treatment of neutrino radiation. Finally, Appendix\n\\ref{sec:coupling} contains some non-standard implementation details of the\noperator split technique we use to treat the weak source/sink terms in the\nhydrodynamics equations.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, we use a system of units such that $c = G = M_\\odot\n= 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $G$ is the gravitational\nconstant,  and $M_\\odot$ is the mass of the Sun. We use Einstein's convention of\nsummation over repeated indices. Latin indices run over $1,2,3$, while Greek\nindices run over $0,1,2,3$. The spacetime metric signature we adopt is\n$(-,+,+,+)$.\n\n\n\\section{Numerical Model}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\n\\subsection{General-Relativistic Hydrodynamics}\n\\label{sec:grhydro}\nWe simulate the merging \\acp{NS} using the equations of \\ac{GR} hydrodynamics\n\\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{Rezzolla_book:2013}.

In\naddition, \\texttt{WhiskyTHC} also implements a variant of the \\ac{CMA} method\noriginally proposed by \\citet{plewa:99}. This scheme minimizes advection errors\nnear strong density and compositional gradients, such as at the surface of a\n\\ac{NS}. We find the use of the \\ac{CMA} scheme to be crucial for quasi-circular\nbinaries that otherwise accumulate significant advection errors close to the\nsurface during their inspiral. On the other hand, the \\ac{CMA} method does not\nseem to be critical for eccentric binaries. The latter have a relatively short\napproaching phase and, in the case of models undergoing multiple encounters,\ngenerate a dense, well-resolved, ``envelope'' after their first encounter (see\nSect. \\ref{sec:results.dynamics}). For this reason, we employ the \\ac{CMA}\nscheme only for the quasi-circular binaries. However, we verify the robustness\nof our results by simulating one of the eccentric models using the \\ac{CMA}\nscheme.\n\nFinally, we evolve the spacetime with the \\mbox{BSSNOK} formulation of the\nEinstein equations \\citep{Nakamura87, Shibata95, Baumgarte99}, using the\n\\texttt{Mclachlan} code \\citep{Brown:2008sb}, which is part of the\n\\texttt{Einstein Toolkit} \\citep{Loffler:2011ay}, and a fourth-order accurate\nfinite-difference scheme.\n\n\\subsection{Neutrino Treatment}\n\\label{sec:leakage}\nOur neutrino treatment is based on a so-called gray (energy-averaged) leakage\nscheme, which is a parametrized neutrino cooling scheme that has been widely\nused for both core-collapse supernovae and \\ac{BNS} simulations\n\\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{vanriper:81, ruffert:96, rosswog:03, oconnor:10, perego:15}. Our\nleakage scheme is an evolution of the scheme presented in \\citet{galeazzi:13}.\nIt follows very closely the method used in \\citet{ruffert:96}, with the\nadditional simplification that we use the local thermodynamical equilibrium\nchemical potential for the neutrinos while computing opacities as done in\n\\citet{rosswog:03}. Finally, for the calculation of the optical depth, we adopt\nthe prescription presented in \\citet{neilsen:14}, which is well suited for\ncomplex geometries as the ones encountered in \\ac{BNS} mergers.\n\nHere, we limit our discussions to the aspects of our leakage scheme that differs\nfrom theirs. The basic idea of the leakage scheme is to compute a series of\neffective emissivities $R^{{\\mathrm{eff}}}$ and $Q^{{\\mathrm{eff}}}$ for electron neutrinos $\\nu_e$,\nanti-electron neutrinos $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ and the heavy-lepton neutrinos, which we\ncollectively label as $\\nu_x$. These rates are reduced with respect to the\nintrinsic emissivities in a way that mimics the diffusion of radiation from the\nhigh optical depth region.

The way we compute $R$ and $Q$ is described in Sect. \\ref{sec:leakage}.\n\nEquations \\eqref{eq:tmunu} and \\eqref{eq:composition} are discretized in\nflux-conservative form using the \\texttt{WhiskyTHC} code \\citep{radice:12b,\nradice:14a, radice:15b}. \\texttt{WhiskyTHC} implements both finite-volume and\nhigh-order finite-differencing high-resolution shock-capturing methods. For the\nsimulations presented in this work, we use the high-order MP5 primitive\nreconstruction scheme \\citep{suresh:97} in combination with 2nd order numerical\nfluxes computed with the HLLE flux formula \\citep{HLLE:88}. In all simulations\nwe employ the positivity preserving limiter presented in \\citet{radice:14b},\nwhich minimizes errors related to the numerical density floor.\n\n\\texttt{WhiskyTHC} directly evolves the proton $n_e$ and neutron $n-n_e$ number\ndensities thereby guaranteeing the local conservation of both species. In\naddition, \\texttt{WhiskyTHC} also implements a variant of the \\ac{CMA} method\noriginally proposed by \\citet{plewa:99}. This scheme minimizes advection errors\nnear strong density and compositional gradients, such as at the surface of a\n\\ac{NS}. We find the use of the \\ac{CMA} scheme to be crucial for quasi-circular\nbinaries that otherwise accumulate significant advection errors close to the\nsurface during their inspiral. On the other hand, the \\ac{CMA} method does not\nseem to be critical for eccentric binaries. The latter have a relatively short\napproaching phase and, in the case of models undergoing multiple encounters,\ngenerate a dense, well-resolved, ``envelope'' after their first encounter (see\nSect. \\ref{sec:results.dynamics}). For this reason, we employ the \\ac{CMA}\nscheme only for the quasi-circular binaries. However, we verify the robustness\nof our results by simulating one of the eccentric models using the \\ac{CMA}\nscheme.\n\nFinally, we evolve the spacetime with the \\mbox{BSSNOK} formulation of the\nEinstein equations \\citep{Nakamura87, Shibata95, Baumgarte99}, using the\n\\texttt{Mclachlan} code \\citep{Brown:2008sb}, which is part of the\n\\texttt{Einstein Toolkit} \\citep{Loffler:2011ay}, and a fourth-order accurate\nfinite-difference scheme.\n\n\\subsection{Neutrino Treatment}\n\\label{sec:leakage}\nOur neutrino treatment is based on a so-called gray (energy-averaged) leakage\nscheme, which is a parametrized neutrino cooling scheme that has been widely\nused for both core-collapse supernovae and \\ac{BNS} simulations\n\\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{vanriper:81, ruffert:96, rosswog:03, oconnor:10, perego:15}. Our\nleakage scheme is an evolution of the scheme presented in \\citet{galeazzi:13}.\nIt follows very closely the method used in \\citet{ruffert:96}, with the\nadditional simplification that we use the local thermodynamical equilibrium\nchemical potential for the neutrinos while computing opacities as done in\n\\citet{rosswog:03}. Finally, for the calculation of the optical depth, we adopt\nthe prescription presented in \\citet{neilsen:14}, which is well suited for\ncomplex geometries as the ones encountered in \\ac{BNS} mergers.\n\nHere, we limit our discussions to the aspects of our leakage scheme that differs\nfrom theirs. The basic idea of the leakage scheme is to compute a series of\neffective emissivities $R^{{\\mathrm{eff}}}$ and $Q^{{\\mathrm{eff}}}$ for electron neutrinos $\\nu_e$,\nanti-electron neutrinos $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ and the heavy-lepton neutrinos, which we\ncollectively label as $\\nu_x$. These rates are reduced with respect to the\nintrinsic emissivities in a way that mimics the diffusion of radiation from the\nhigh optical depth region. In addition to this, our scheme also estimates\nheating and lepton-deposition from the absorption of free-streaming neutrinos.\nThe inclusion of neutrino absorption is motivated by the recent works of\n\\citet{wanajo:14, sekiguchi:15, foucart:15a, foucart:15b}, which showed, using\ngray two-moment schemes \\citep{shibata:12}, that neutrino absorption can alter\nthe composition of the ejecta.

For that, we use a closure adapted\nto the post-merger geometry discussed in detail in Appendix~\\ref{sec:M0}.  Our\nscheme is simpler than the two-moment gray method recently used by\n\\citet{wanajo:14, sekiguchi:15, foucart:15a, foucart:15b}. However, since it\ntracks both neutrino density and average energies, it allows us to model a\nnumber of important effects that cannot be easily incorporated into gray\nschemes.  In particular, our scheme takes gravitational redshift, velocity\ndependence and non local-thermodynamical equilibrium effects into account,\nalbeit with some major approximations. More details of our radiation transport\nscheme are given in Appendix~\\ref{sec:M0}, while some technical details of the\ncoupling with the hydrodynamics are discussed in Appendix~\\ref{sec:coupling}.\nNote that heating in the M0 code is switched-on only shortly before the merger,\nbecause our prescription is not suitable for the phase when the two \\ac{NS}s are\nstill separated and heating is obviously not relevant. After \\ac{BH} formation,\nwe also excise the area inside and close to the apparent horizon in the M0\nscheme.

One describing two \\acp{NS}\non Newtonian parabolic orbits with varying (Newtonian) periastron radius $r_p$,\nand another family describing binaries in quasi-circular (low eccentricity)\norbits. In both cases, we fix the mass ratio to one (equal mass binaries). A\nsummary of all evolved models is presented in Tab. \\ref{tab:models}.\n\nWe construct the eccentric initial data using binaries where each star has\ngravitational mass at infinite separation $M_\\infty = 1.389\\ M_\\odot$ and\nbaryonic mass $M_b = 1.522\\ M_\\odot$. We setup the initial data by superimposing\ntwo \\ac{TOV} \\citep{tolman:39, oppenheimer:39} solutions in neutrino-less beta\nequilibrium at the initial separation of $100\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 148\\ \\mathrm{km}$.\nWe set the orbital velocity of the two stars according to Newton's law to have a\nNewtonian periastron radius of $0, 5\\, M_\\odot, 7.5\\, M_\\odot, 10\\, M_\\odot$,\nand $15\\, M_\\odot$ ($\\simeq 0, 7.38\\, \\mathrm{km}, 11.08\\, \\mathrm{km}, 14.76\\,\n\\mathrm{km}$, and $22.15\\,\\mathrm{km}$).\n\nSince this construction does not yield an exact solution to Einstein equations,\nit results in violations of the Hamiltonian constraint equations that are\nbetween $1$ and $2$ orders of magnitude larger than for quasi-circular binary\ninitial data. These values are within an acceptable range in that the\nconstraints remain well behaved during the evolution. On the other hand, since\nwe do not solve for the hydrostatic equilibrium of the \\acp{NS} after boosting\nthem, this triggers oscillations in the two \\acp{NS} with typical amplitudes\n$\\delta \\rho_{\\max}/\\rho_{\\max} \\sim 0.15$. More accurate initial data could be\nobtained using the methods described in \\citet{east:12c} or\n\\citet{moldenhauer:14}. Alternatively, the errors in the constraint could be\nmitigated adopting constraint-damping formulations of the Einstein equations\n\\citep{bernuzzi:10, weyhausen:11, alic:11a, hildich:13, alic:13, kastaun:13}.\nNote, however, that none of these methods, with the exception of\n\\citet{moldenhauer:14}, solves for the hydrostatic equilibrium and can remove\nall of the oscillations. We leave the investigation of these methods to future\nwork.\n\nWe construct the quasi-circular (low eccentricity) initial data using the\n\\texttt{LORENE} pseudo-spectral elliptic solver \\citep{gourgoulhon:01}. We setup\nirrotational initial data at a separation of $45\\ \\mathrm{km}$ consisting of\n\\acp{NS} each having gravitational mass at infinite separation $M_\\infty =\n1.384\\ M_\\odot$ and baryonic mass $M_b = 1.515\\ M_\\odot$.\n\nFor the evolution we make use of the \\ac{AMR} capabilities provided by the\n\\texttt{Carpet} \\citep{schnetter:03b} mesh refinement driver for \\texttt{Cactus}\n\\citep{goodale:03}. During the inspiral, we employ a grid composed of 5\nrefinement levels with the finest ones composed of boxes that move to follow the\ncenters of the two \\acp{NS}. After merger, we switch to a fixed grid, also\ncomposed of 5 refinement levels. In both cases, the finest grid, which covers\nthe two neutron stars and the merger remnant, has a grid spacing of $h = 0.145\\\nM_\\odot \\simeq 215\\ \\mathrm{m}$. We also perform a simulation at lower\nresolution with $h = 0.25\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 369\\ \\mathrm{m}$ to estimate\nfinite-resolution effects on our simulations. To reduce the computational cost,\nwe exploit the symmetries of the problem to restrict our calculations to $x \\geq\n0$, $z \\geq 0$: rotational symmetry is used across the $yz-$plane and reflection\nsymmetry is uses across the $xz-$plane.\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\n\n\\subsection{Overall Dynamics}\n\\label{sec:results.dynamics}\nEccentric and quasi-circular \\ac{BNS} mergers have rich dynamics that can lead\nto a number of outcomes depending on the \\ac{EOS}, masses, and orbital\nparameters of the binary \\citep{shibata:06, baiotti:08, rezzolla:10, gold:12,\neast:12b, paschalidis:15, east:15b}. This is also reflected in the dynamics of\nour simulations. Binaries with small Newtonian periastron radii (\\texttt{RP0} --\nhead-on collision -- and \\texttt{RP5}) result in prompt \\ac{BH} formation and\nnegligible amount of unbound mass. Binaries with larger Newtonian periastron\nradii, {\\textit{e.g.}}, \\texttt{RP7.5}, and quasi-circular binaries (\\texttt{QC}) result in\nthe formation of \\acp{HMNS} \\citep{baumgarte:00}, meta-stable massive remnants\ntemporarily supported against gravitational collapse by a large degree of\ndifferential rotation \\citep{baiotti:08, kaplan:14}. Binaries with\nlarger Newtonian periastron radii (models \\texttt{RP10} and \\texttt{RP15})\nresult in multiple close encounters.  The \\texttt{RP10} model, in particular,\nhas a very complex dynamics and undergoes three close encounters, before finally\nmerging after the third encounter. The \\texttt{RP15} model is also expected to\nundergo multiple encounters, however the timescales between successive\nencounters is too long to be simulated with our methods, so we only consider its\nfirst close passage.\n\nThe orbital dynamics of the \\texttt{RP10} model appears to be very sensitive to\nsmall changes in the simulation inputs and, in our preliminary tests, we\nobserved differences in the timing and number of encounters with changes in the\nnumerical parameters ({\\textit{e.g.}}, resolution). A similar behavior is also observed in\neccentric binary \\ac{BH}s encounters \\citep{damour:14, guercilena:15}. For this\nreason, the \\texttt{RP10} simulations should be considered as particular\nrealizations of the dynamics close to the threshold between direct merger and\nmultiple encounters and not necessarily as the outcomes of encounters with $r_p$\nexactly equal to $10\\ M_\\odot$. Indeed, the precise \\emph{value} of this\nthreshold is probably the imprint of our numerical setup and is likely to change\nonce this setup is varied. On the other hand, the \\emph{existence} of such a\nthreshold will not depend on the numerical details.  The orbital dynamics of the\nother binaries, instead, appears robust.  The accuracy of numerical relativity\nsimulations of quasi-circular \\ac{BNS} inspirals has been studied in detail in\nthe past (\\mbox{\\citealt{baiotti:09};} \\citealt{baiotti:10, bernuzzi:12,\nradice:14a, radice:14b, radice:15b}).\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig01.pdf}\n  \\caption{Rest-mass density (equation \\ref{eq:rmd}) in the orbital plane for\n  the parabolic encounter simulation \\texttt{LK\\_RP10} at six different times.\n  The \\ac{NS}s undergo three close encounters before merging.

During the periastron passage strong tidal torques and shocks result\nin episodic outflow events. Part of the ejected neutron-rich matter is unbound\nfrom the system (more on this in Sect. \\ref{sec:results.ejecta}), while the rest\nsettles in a thick atmosphere around the \\ac{NS}s. The atmosphere is mostly\nthermally supported in the purely hydrodynamic \\texttt{HY\\_RP10} simulation, but\nnot in the simulations which include neutrino cooling. In the latter cases, the\n``envelope'' around the binary has time to cool and partly accrete back onto the\n\\ac{NS}s in the time between successive encounters.  This results in the\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP10} simulation undergoing its last encounter $\\sim 2\\ \\mathrm{ms}$\nbefore \\texttt{HY\\_RP10}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig02.pdf}\n  \\caption{Real part of the $\\ell = 2,\\ m = 2$ spin-weighted spherical harmonics\n  component of the Weyl scalar $\\Psi_4$ for the \\texttt{LK\\_RP10}, extracted at\n  $r_\\star = 400\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 590\\ \\mathrm{km}$.

They showed that tidal interactions during close\nencounters can excite the fundamental modes of oscillation of the two \\acp{NS}.\nThis is apparent in our \\texttt{RP10} model whose curvature \\ac{GW} signal, the\nWeyl scalar $\\Psi_4$\\footnote{We remind the reader that the complex scalar\n$\\Psi_4$ combines the second time derivatives of the two strain polarizations\n\\mbox{$\\Psi_4 = \\ddot{h}_+ - \\mathrm{i}\\, \\ddot{h}_\\times$}.}, is shown in Fig.\n\\ref{fig:psi4}. The first encounter is accompanied by a burst in \\acp{GW}\nfollowed by a quasi-periodic signal lasting about $\\sim 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, {\\textit{i.e.}},\nup to the time of the second encounter. For all of the \\texttt{RP10}\nsimulations, we find the interaction between the two \\acp{NS} during the second\nencounter to suppress the oscillations of the two stars leading to a sudden\nshutdown of the \\ac{GW} emission. This is an effect that has not been reported\nbefore. However, it may be a consequence of the $\\pi-$symmetry imposed during\nthe evolution.  More simulations would be required to address this question. A\nsecond, sudden, burst in \\acp{GW} appears at the time of merger.\n\nLike the orbital dynamics of the binaries before the merger, also their\npost-merger evolution shows a large variety. As discussed above, the merger can\nresult in prompt \\ac{BH} formation for binaries with little angular momentum\n(\\texttt{RP0}, \\texttt{RP5}) or in the formation of a \\ac{HMNS}.  Furthermore,\nsince different models merge with different amount of residual angular momentum\nand mass, the structure and rotational configuration of the \\ac{HMNS} can vary\nsignificantly leading to different evolutionary paths.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig03.pdf}\n  \\caption{Maximum rest-mass density (equation \\ref{eq:rmd}) as a function of\n  time for the simulations with neutrino cooling, \\texttt{LK} runs. The\n  \\texttt{LK\\_RP} runs are with eccentric binaries, while the \\texttt{LK\\_QC} is\n  quasi-circular. Although all of the models have almost the same mass and we\n  use a single \\ac{EOS}, there is significant variability in the outcome of the\n  merger due to the differences in the amount of angular momentum of the binary\n  at merger.}\n  \\label{fig:rhoc}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThis is summarized in Fig. \\ref{fig:rhoc}, where we show the maximum rest-mass\ndensity as a function of time for a group of representative simulations. The\n\\texttt{RP5} model exhibits prompt collapse: the central density rapidly grows\nuntil an apparent horizon is formed. After the formation of the apparent\nhorizon, $\\rho_{\\max}$ appears to drop, because we exclude the region inside the\n\\ac{BH} in the calculation of the maximum density. The \\texttt{RP7.5} model\nexperiences a rather violent merger: the two stellar cores collide, slightly\novershoot each other, and then merge again after $\\sim 2\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. In\ncomparison, the quasi-circular model \\texttt{QC} experiences a much milder\nmerger, with a smaller initial jump in the density. However, since the\n\\texttt{QC} binaries merge with smaller residual total angular momentum than the\n\\texttt{RP7.5} binaries, the resulting \\ac{HMNS} contracts and oscillates\nviolently before collapsing to a \\ac{BH} within $\\sim 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ after\nmerger. Finally, the \\texttt{RP10} binary merges with a large amount of residual\nangular momentum, which sustains the hypermassive merger remnant over the entire\nsimulated time ($\\gtrsim 20\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ after merger).\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig04.pdf}\n  \\caption{Neutrino luminosity for runs \\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5}, \\texttt{LK\\_RP10},\n  and \\texttt{LK\\_QC}. \\emph{Left panel:} electron neutrino luminosity.\n  \\emph{Middle panel:} electron anti-neutrino luminosity. \\emph{Right panel:}\n  total luminosity from heavy lepton ($\\mu, \\bar{\\mu}, \\tau, \\bar{\\tau}$)\n  neutrinos.  Models with small periastron radius, such as \\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5},\n  result in violent mergers with very bright neutrino bursts.}\n  \\label{fig:luminosity}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe diversity in the merger dynamics is also reflected in the neutrino signals\nshown in Fig. \\ref{fig:luminosity}. The violent merger in the\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5} simulation results in neutrino luminosities in excess of\n$10^{54}\\ \\mathrm{erg}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ sustained over multiple milliseconds.\nThese luminosities are comparable to those reported by \\citet{rosswog:13}, who,\nhowever, performed simulations using Newtonian gravity and a different nuclear\n\\ac{EOS}. These luminosities are almost an order of magnitude larger than for\nour fiducial quasi-circular simulation (model \\texttt{QC\\_LK}). The\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP10} simulation displays sudden rises in its neutrino emissions in\ncoincidence with each close encounter, followed by cooling phases where the\nluminosity drops exponentially in time. Finally, the \\texttt{QC\\_LK} run shows a\nsingle burst in its neutrino emission at the time of merger, followed by a rapid\ndecay in its luminosity as soon as the \\ac{HMNS} collapses to a \\ac{BH}. The\nearly time, $t \\lesssim 12\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, neutrino emissions from the\n\\texttt{QC\\_LK} simulation are due to the spurious heating of the surface of the\ntwo \\acp{NS} caused by our numerical scheme. These early-time neutrino energy\nlosses might appear large, but they are actually not dynamically important as\nthey are $\\sim 2$ orders of magnitude smaller than the \\ac{GW} luminosity, which\npeaks at $\\sim 2\\times 10^{55}\\ \\mathrm{erg}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at the time of\nmerger.\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical Ejecta}\n\\label{sec:results.ejecta}\n\\subsubsection{Ejected Mass}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig05.pdf}\n  \\caption{Dynamically ejected mass for all simulations as a function of the\n  Newtonian periastron radius $r_p$. The ejecta mass is computed integrating in\n  time the flux of unbound matter (with $u_t \\leq -1$) across the surface of a\n  spherical sphere with radius $r = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$. The\n  horizontal lines denote the ejected mass from the quasi-circular runs. The\n  ejecta for models with $r_p = 0$ and $r_p = 15\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 14.78\\\n  \\mathrm{km}$ are under-resolved and should not be taken at face value.\n  Overall, eccentric binaries can eject up to $2$ orders of magnitude more mass\n  than quasi-circular binaries.}\n  \\label{fig:ejecta.mass}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\noindent Being on Newtonian parabolic orbits, our eccentric \\ac{BNS} binaries\nare only weakly bound. For this reason, it is not surprising to find that they\ncan unbind a significantly larger amount of matter compared to quasi-circular\nmergers.  Figure \\ref{fig:ejecta.mass} shows the total amount of unbound matter\nfor each of our simulations (also reported in Tab. \\ref{tab:models}). The total\nejected rest mass is computed integrating in time the flux of matter with $u_t\n\\leq -1$\\footnote{See \\citet{kastaun:15} for a discussion of possible\nalternative criteria to identify unbound fluid elements.} across a spherical\ncoordinate surface with radius $200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$.  Note\nthat these estimates do not include late-time mass ejection driven by neutrino,\nviscous heating, and/or magnetic pressure, which would take place on longer\ntimescales \\citep{dessart:09, fernandez:13, siegel:14, metzger:14, fernandez:14,\nrezzolla:14, ciolfi:14, fernandez:15, just:15a, martin:15, kiuchi:15a}. The\ndynamical mass ejection in our simulations is impulsive and concentrated in one\nor, in the \\texttt{RP10} models, three ejection events lasting only several\nmilliseconds. For this reason, our measure of the dynamically ejected mass is\nrobust with respect to the physical time covered by our simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome interesting trends can be observed from Fig. \\ref{fig:ejecta.mass}.  First\nof all, we find that eccentric mergers, and in particular mergers with impact\nparameters close to the threshold between prompt merger and multiple-encounters,\nseem to be those resulting in the largest mass ejection.  This is similar to\nwhat was found by \\citet{east:12b}. Note that the \\texttt{RP15} model is likely\nto experience more mass ejection in its successive encounters, which will happen\nover timescales that we cannot simulate directly.  Nevertheless, we still expect\nencounters such as that of the \\texttt{LK\\_RP15} run to yield lower ejecta mass\ncompared to encounters resulting in mergers over a short dynamical timescale,\nsuch as \\texttt{RP7.5} and \\texttt{RP10}. The reason for this is that model\n\\texttt{RP15} will undergo merger in a more gravitationally bound state than\nmodel \\texttt{RP7.5} or model \\texttt{RP10}. As a consequence, we conjecture on\nthe basis of our data that eccentric \\ac{BNS} mergers can yield up to $\\sim 0.1\\\nM_\\odot$ of ejecta, slightly less than what can be achieved with \\ac{BHNS}\nmergers \\citep{foucart:14, kyutoku:15}, but almost two orders of magnitude\nlarger than what is ejected by mergers of BNSs in quasi-circular orbits.\n\nWe find significant differences between the \\texttt{LK} results, which include\nneutrino cooling, and the \\texttt{HY}, which neglect it. For all our models we\nfind that neglecting neutrino cooling results in an overestimate of the unbound\nmass by a factor $\\gtrsim 2$. This hints at the importance of neutrino-radiation\nprocesses in shaping the outflows from these mergers. As documented in detail by\n\\citet{hotokezaka:13} and \\citet{bauswein:13}, a significant fraction of the\nejecta in \\ac{GR} simulations is driven by shocks.  In our simulations neutrino\nlosses in the optically thin outflows are rapid and sufficient to cause part of\nthe material to become gravitationally bound again by removing part of its\ninternal energy. In addition, the total amount of mass ejected by the\n\\texttt{RP10} binaries is also affected by the cooling of the thick atmosphere\ngenerated during the first encounter of the two \\acp{NS}, which is suppressed in\nthe \\texttt{HY\\_RP10} run, as discussed in Sect.  \\ref{sec:results.dynamics}.\n\nThe differences between models including only cooling (\\texttt{LK}) and models\nalso including heating (\\texttt{M0}) are also important, but less striking. We\nfind that, for most models, the inclusion of heating results in a slight\nincrease of the total ejected mass. The only exception is the quasi-circular\nbinary (\\texttt{QC}), for which turning on heating results in an reduction of\nthe ejected mass by a factor $\\sim 2$. At first, immediately after the merger,\nthe \\texttt{M0\\_QC} simulation shows a slightly larger outflow rate than the\n\\texttt{LK\\_QC} run. However, by the time the outflow rate of \\texttt{LK\\_QC}\npeaks, the \\texttt{M0\\_QC} shows a sudden decrease in the ejection rate.  The\nreason seems to be that, in the latter, part of the shock-driven outflow ends up\ncolliding with the gravitationally bound part of the tidal tail. This tail has a\nlarger vertical extent when heating is turned on and the interaction between it\nand the shock-driven outflows prevents the latter from being ejected. This is\nreflected by the lack of ejecta at intermediate latitudes ($45^\\circ \\lesssim\n\\theta \\lesssim 80^\\circ$) in the \\texttt{M0\\_QC} run (see Fig.\n\\ref{fig:histograms}; bottom row). Note that we do not necessarily expect this\nto be a generic feature in quasi-circular \\ac{BNS} mergers. This is also\ndifferent from what was reported by \\citet{sekiguchi:15}, who always found an\nincrease in the total ejected mass when heating was included. It is, however, a\nclear indication that neutrino radiation likely plays an important role also in\nshaping the non-linear dynamics of the bulk of these outflows and not just their\ncomposition.\n\n\\subsubsection{Properties of the Outflow}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07a.pdf}\\[1em]\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07b.pdf}\\[1em]\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07c.pdf}\\[1em]\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07d.pdf}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{Electron fraction (\\emph{top row}), specific entropy per baryon\n  (\\emph{second row}), asymptotic velocity (\\emph{third row}), and angular\n  distribution (\\emph{bottom row}) of the ejecta. $\\theta$ is the angle from the\n  orbital plane. The first, second, and third columns show results from models\n  \\texttt{RP7.5}, \\texttt{RP10}, and \\texttt{QC} respectively. For each\n  configuration we consider three different levels of microphysical description:\n  pure hydrodynamics (\\texttt{HY}), neutrino cooling (\\texttt{LK}), or neutrino\n  cooling and heating (\\texttt{M0}). The histograms are computed from the mass\n  fraction of the matter crossing a spherical surface at radius $r = 200\\\n  M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$ with positive specific energy ({\\textit{i.e.}}, with $u_t\n  \\leq -1$). The bump in the angular distribution at $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ is a\n  numerical artefact generated by our Cartesian simulation grid.}\n  \\label{fig:histograms}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent We collect composition, specific entropy, asymptotic velocity and\nangular distribution of the ejecta for the three most interesting models,\n\\texttt{RP7.5} (representative of a violent collision), \\texttt{RP10}\n(representative of the dynamics with multiple encounters), and \\texttt{QC} (our\nfiducial quasi-circular binary) in Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}. The histograms are\ngenerated by binning the properties of the unbound matter (with $u_t \\leq -1$)\nflowing through a coordinate sphere with radius $r = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\\n\\mathrm{km}$. As can be seen from Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}, morphology and\nthermodynamical properties of the ejecta show large variations with binary\nconfiguration and neutrino treatment. This is a consequence of the complex\ninterplay, between radiation and hydrodynamics, that controls the mass ejection.\n\nThe electron fraction of the ejecta is one of the most important quantities\ndetermining both the outcome of the nucleosynthesis (more in Sect.\n\\ref{sec:results.nucleosynthesis}) and the properties of the \\ac{EM} signature\nof the merger (see Sect. \\ref{sec:results.EM}). It is also the quantity showing\nthe greatest variation. Simulations neglecting all weak interactions are,\nunsurprisingly, characterized by extremely neutron-rich ejecta. In these\nsimulations, $Y_e$ is simply advected with the flow and unchanged. On the other\nhand, when weak interactions are included, $Y_e$ can evolve due to electron or\npositron captures in shock-heated material (in the \\texttt{LK} and \\texttt{M0}\nsimulations) and due to neutrino absorption (in the \\texttt{M0} simulations). As\na consequence, simulations accounting for weak interactions show a much wider\nrange of electron fractions.\n\nIndependent of binary parameters, we find the ejecta to have a clear bi-modal\ndistribution in $Y_e$. Part of the outflow, driven by tidal torques, is cold and\nneutron rich, while another component, launched by shocks during merger,\nexperiences high-temperatures and rapid protonization with values of $Y_e$\npeaking at $\\sim 0.16$. The \\texttt{M0} simulations also show a relatively\nproton-rich $Y_e \\simeq 0.4$ component of the outflow, predominantly at high\nlatitudes (more on this later). The final mass distribution of $Y_e$ depends on\nthe relative importance of these different components.\n\nThe composition of the ejecta from our simulations is somewhat more neutron rich\nthan that of \\citet{wanajo:14} and \\citet{sekiguchi:15}. These studies appear to\nbe lacking any cold component in their outflows. This might be a consequence of\nthe different treatment of the neutrino radiation or of the choice of \\ac{EOS}.\nInstead, we find good qualitative agreement between our \\texttt{LK\\_QC} results\nand those of \\citet{palenzuela:15}, who adopted different \\ac{EOS}, but a\nneutrino cooling treatment very similar to ours. Our ejecta are also\nsignificantly more proton-rich than those typically found in Newtonian\nsimulations \\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{rosswog:13}, where the tidal component is enhanced\nwith respect to \\ac{GR} simulations \\citep{bauswein:13}.\n\nThe composition of the ejecta differs between eccentric and quasi-circular\nmergers. The reason for this is that eccentric mergers producing large ejecta\nmass do so mostly as a consequence of the enhanced tidal interaction between the\ntwo \\ac{NS}s during close passages. As a consequence, only nearly head-on\ncollisions (model \\texttt{RP5}) result in more proton-rich ejecta than the\n\\texttt{QC} binaries (see Tab. \\ref{tab:models}). This trend is the\n\\emph{opposite} of what has been reported in Newtonian simulations, where\nquasi-circular binaries are dominated by tidal ejecta with low-$Y_e$ and\neccentric binaries by shock-heated, high-$Y_e$, ejecta \\citep{rosswog:13}. The\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5} simulation has ejecta composition that is very similar to\nthat of the quasi-circular \\texttt{LK\\_QC}, while the multiple encounter\nsimulation \\texttt{LK\\_RP10} has significantly more neutron rich ejecta than\nboth.\n\nThe effect of neutrino absorption on the electron fraction is non-negligible, as\nalso found by \\citet{wanajo:14}, \\citet{sekiguchi:15}, and \\citet{foucart:15b},\nalthough in our simulations the impact is less significant than in these\nprevious studies. The \\texttt{M0} runs have more proton rich ejecta than the\n\\texttt{LK} simulations, but the differences appear to be mostly confined to the\ntail of the ejecta distribution in $Y_e$, while the mass-weighted average of the\nelectron fraction $\\langle Y_e \\rangle$ is not strongly affected ({\\textit{cf.}}, Tab.\n\\ref{tab:models} and Fig.  \\ref{fig:histograms}).\n\nAs can be seen from the second row of Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}, the specific\nentropy per baryon of the ejecta shows somewhat smaller differences between\nsimulations than $Y_e$. The overall trend is that runs that include neutrino\ncooling effects (\\texttt{LK} and \\texttt{M0}) display lower specific entropies\nthan purely hydrodynamical models, which overestimate the final entropy of the\nshock-heated ejecta.\n\nWe find the bulk of the outflow to be sub-relativistic with asymptotic\nvelocities $v_\\infty \\lesssim c/3$ (third row of Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}) for\nboth eccentric and quasi-circular models. This is in contrast with Newtonian\nsimulations \\citep{rosswog:13}, but is similar to other \\ac{GR} studies\n\\citep{east:12b, sekiguchi:15, east:15b}. There are some differences in the\nasymptotic velocities between \\texttt{HY}, \\texttt{LK}, and \\texttt{M0}\nsimulations, but there is no clear trend.\n\nWe show the angular distribution of the ejecta in the bottom row of panels in\nFig. \\ref{fig:histograms}. We find the outflow of the \\texttt{RP10} model, which\nejects matter mostly due to tidal torques during its multiple encounters, to be\nmostly contained in a narrow angle around the orbital plane. This is similar\nwhat found for the ejecta of \\ac{BHNS} mergers \\citep{foucart:14, kyutoku:15}.\nThe other models show a larger angular spread of the outflow with the bulk of\nthe ejecta appearing to be contained within an angle $\\theta \\lesssim 60^\\circ$\nof the orbital plane.  The bump in the ejecta distribution function at $\\theta =\n45^\\circ$ is a numerical artefact associated with our Cartesian simulation grid\nthat tends to funnel flows along its symmetry directions.\n\nThe amount of ejected material at high latitudes ($\\theta \\gtrsim 60^\\circ$) is\nalso strongly dependent on the included physics in our simulations. Runs that do\nnot include neutrino cooling tend to overestimate, by a factor of a few, the\namount of matter in the polar region of the post-merger remnant. Conversely,\nsimulations that include neutrino cooling, but not heating, underestimate the\nbaryon contamination of the poles by a similar factor. These differences might\nhave an impact for the simulation of \\ac{SGRB} engines, because baryon\ncontamination of the polar regions might prevent the launch of relativistic jets\nin some \\ac{SGRB} models \\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{just:15b}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Ejection Mechanisms}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig08.pdf}\n  \\caption{Angular distribution (\\emph{upper half of each panel}) and\n  composition (\\emph{lower half of each panel}) of the ejecta for the\n  \\texttt{LK\\_QC} (\\emph{upper panel}) and \\texttt{M0\\_QC} (\\emph{lower panel})\n  simulations as a function of time. The data is collected on a coordinate\n  sphere at radius $r = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$ and only considers\n  the unbound part of the outflow ({\\textit{i.e.}}, with $u_t \\leq -1$). The gray shaded\n  areas refer to times/angles for which we do not measure any outflow of unbound\n  matter ({\\textit{i.e.}}, where $u_t > -1$). The ejection event is of very short duration\n  and the outflow is confined within a broad $\\sim 60^\\circ$ angle from the\n  equator.  The material at low altitudes is typically more neutron rich than at\n  higher altitudes, suggesting a different ejection mechanisms for the different\n  components of the outflow.}\n  \\label{fig:ejecta.profile}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent In Fig. \\ref{fig:ejecta.profile}, we show the angular density and\n$Y_e$ distribution of the ejecta for two of the quasi-circular \\ac{BNS}\nsimulations: \\texttt{LK\\_QC} and \\texttt{M0\\_QC}. These profiles hint at the\ninterplay between a few distinct mechanism for the dynamical ejection of \\ac{NS}\nmatter. A first component of the outflow is driven by tidal interactions between\nthe \\acp{NS}. It is very neutron rich, with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.1$, and confined in\na narrow $\\sim 20^\\circ$ angle from the orbital plane. In our simulations, this\nis the first component to reach the fiducial outflow surface at $t \\simeq 16\\\n\\mathrm{ms}$ ({\\textit{i.e.}}, $\\simeq 3\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ after the merger; consistent with an\noutflow velocity of $\\sim c/3$). This component is present in all of our\nsimulations, regardless of their level of microphysical description.\n\nA second component is driven by shocks launched during merger. It is less\nneutron rich, with $Y_e \\sim 0.15$, and more isotropic, spanning an angular\nregion of about $60^\\circ$ from the orbital plane. Shock driven ejecta lag the\ntidal tails by a few ms. As previously discussed, the quasi-circular binary with\nneutrino cooling, but not heating (\\texttt{LK\\_QC}), is able to unbind more\nmaterial than the one with also heating included (\\texttt{M0\\_QC}). This is a\nconsequence of the different non-linear hydrodynamics evolution of the two\noutflows.\n\nFinally, a third component is constituted by a high-latitude wind driven by a\ncombination of shock and neutrino heating. This component is relatively proton\nrich with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.25$. It is mostly absent in the \\texttt{LK\\_QC}\nsimulation, but becomes the dominant outflow component after $t \\simeq 21\\\n\\mathrm{ms}$ in the \\texttt{M0\\_QC} run.\n\nThe interplay between low-$Y_e$ (close to the equator) and high-$Y_e$ (at high\nlatitudes) ejecta is what determines the final electron fraction distribution of\nthe ejecta (Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}) and the r-process yields (more in Sect.\n\\ref{sec:results.nucleosynthesis}).\n\n\\subsection{Nucleosynthesis}\n\\label{sec:results.nucleosynthesis}\nAs the material ejected during merger expands, it undergoes neutron capture\nnucleosynthesis, which may produce r-process elements.  In order to estimate the\nfinal nucleosynthetic yields of our simulations, we map our ejecta data onto the\ngrid of parametrized r-process calculations presented in \\citet{lippuner:15}.\nFirst, we extract $Y_e$, $s$, $v$, and $\\rho$ for all of the unbound matter\n(with $u_t \\leq -1$) as it flows across the surface of a coordinate sphere of\nradius $r_E = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$.  To estimate the\nnucleosynthesis in the outflow using our nucleosynthesis grid, the dynamical\ntimescale, $\\tau$, of each ejected fluid element is required.  To estimate\n$\\tau$, we assume that the material crossing our extraction surface is expanding\nhomologously.  This assumption should be relatively well satisfied by our data\ngiven that, by the time the ejecta reach the detection surface, their density\nhas already dropped by $\\sim 3$ orders of magnitude.  Then, the density history\nfor a particular element of the ejecta is given by $\\rho(t) = \\rho_E (v_E\nt/r_E)^{-3}$, where $\\rho_E$ and $v_E$ are the density and velocity of the fluid\nelement when it crosses a sphere of radius $r_E$.  At late times, the density\nhistory used in \\citet{lippuner:15} has the form $\\rho(t)=\\rho(s, Y_e, T=6 \\,\n\\textrm{GK}) (3\\tau/et)^3$, where $e$ is Euler's number.  We match these two\nprofiles to extract $\\tau$. The final yields are then found by multiplying the\nyields computed by \\citet{lippuner:15} at each point in their nucleosynthesis\ngrid with the total mass associated with it.  Such a procedure is necessarily\napproximate, but it enables the rapid calculation of the abundance distribution\nin the ejecta without the need for tracer particles.  Future work should\ndirectly compare this method of yield estimation to more detailed\ntracer-particle based methods.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig09.pdf}\n  \\caption{Final abundances in the ejecta for the \\texttt{RP7.5}, \\texttt{RP10}\n  and \\texttt{QC} configurations.

For each configuration we\n  consider three different levels of microphysical description (pure\n  hydrodynamics, \\texttt{HY} or leakage with only cooling, \\texttt{LK}, or with\n  heating/absorption included, \\texttt{M0}). The abundance pattern for elements\n  with $A\\gtrsim 120$ is very robust and in overall good agreement with the\n  Solar r-process abundances taken from \\citet{arlandini:99}.} \\label{fig:ejecta.yields}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig10.pdf}\n  \\caption{Joint distribution of composition and entropy for the \\texttt{M0\\_QC}\n  simulation. The material to the left of the dashed contour line produces second\n  and third r-process nucleosynthesis, while material to the left of the solid\n  contour line only produces first peak r-process nucleosynthesis. The figure\n  also hints at the existence of a correlation between $Y_e$ and $s$ as larger\n  proton fractions are typically found in combination with high entropies.}\n  \\label{fig:ejecta.corr}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe show the results of this procedure in Fig. \\ref{fig:ejecta.yields}, where we\nplot the relative abundances of different elements in the final composition of\nthe ejecta for three of our models (\\texttt{RP7.5}, \\texttt{RP10}, and\n\\texttt{QC}) and with three different levels of microphysical description\n(\\texttt{HY}, \\texttt{LK}, and \\texttt{M0}).  The dynamical ejecta from all our\nsimulations is neutron rich with mass-averaged electron fractions $\\langle Y_e\n\\rangle \\lesssim 0.2$ (see Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}).  We show the joint\ndistribution of $Y_e$ and specific entropy per baryon $s$ for simulation\n\\texttt{QC\\_M0} in Fig.  \\ref{fig:ejecta.corr}.  There is an approximate\ncorrelation between $Y_e$ and $s$, due to the fact that shock heated material\nundergoes more weak processing. However, the critical electron fraction for\nproducing third-peak r-process elements is relatively insensitive to $s$ (see\nthe contour lines in Fig.  \\ref{fig:ejecta.corr}).  The bulk of the ejecta lies\nin a region of parameter space where a robust r-process will occur.  In fact, we\nfind that fission cycling occurs in most of the material.  As a result, we find\nthe relative abundances for $A \\gtrsim 120$ to be robust and close to Solar,\nregardless of the merger type (eccentric vs.~quasi-circular) and of the neutrino\ntreatment. The only minor difference we find is that eccentric mergers show a\nslight increase in the production of third-peak region nuclei, due to their more\nneutron-rich ejecta.\n\nThe yields for $50 \\lesssim A \\lesssim 90$, referred to here as the first-peak\nregion, show greater variability than the yields at larger $A$.  Material in\nthis atomic mass range is produced in ejecta with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.22$, where an\nincomplete r-process occurs.  Material quickly builds up in the first and second\npeaks and then gets left there due to early neutron exhaustion.  The amount of\nmaterial with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.22$ is sensitive to both the binary parameters and\nthe treatment of neutrinos.  Without weak interactions, in the \\texttt{HY}\nmodels, almost all of the ejected material undergoes a complete r-process for\nall of the binaries.  In the models including electron and positron captures but\nnot neutrino captures (\\texttt{LK}), there is less first peak region material\nfor the eccentric \\ac{BNS} mergers, which have slightly more neutron rich ejecta\nthan the quasi-circular mergers.  The further inclusion of neutrino captures in\nthe \\texttt{M0} models has the largest impact on the yields of the \\texttt{QC}\nmodel. This is likely due to its low average ejecta velocity compared with the\neccentric mergers.  Nonetheless, neutrino captures only have a moderate impact\non the final yields for all simulated binaries.\n\nBecause of the small amount of mass in the high $Y_e$ tail of our ejecta,\nfirst-peak nuclei are underproduced with respect to the Solar abundances (when\nnormalizing to the second r-process peak).  Therefore, we cannot account for all\nof the r-process yields in the dynamical ejecta of binary neutron star mergers.\nThis is in contrast with the results of \\cite{wanajo:14}, who found first-peak\nregion nuclei to be produced in approximately Solar proportion.  Their\nsimulations yield a much wider distribution of $Y_e$ than ours and a larger\nfraction of their ejecta undergoes an incomplete r-process.  The reasons for\nthis discrepancy are unclear, but they could be due to differences in the\n\\ac{EOS} or in the treatment of neutrinos.\n\n\\subsection{Electromagnetic Counterparts}\n\\label{sec:results.EM}\nThe energy released by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei powers\ntransients in the optical or near-infrared band that could potentially be\ndiscovered through \\ac{GW} or \\ac{SGRB} detection follow-up observations and by\nuntargeted transient surveys.\n\nWe use a simple analytical model developed by \\citet{grossman:14} to describe\nthe basic features of the macronova emission that would be produced by the ejecta\nfrom our simulations. \\citet{grossman:14} estimate the time at which the optical\nor near-infrared signal peaks as the time when the radiation diffusion timescale\nis equal to the dynamical timescale of the ejecta\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 19954, "prevtext": "\nand\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:cooling.rhs}\n  Q = (\\kappa_{\\nu_e} n_{\\nu_e} E_{\\nu_e}\n    + \\kappa_{\\bar{\\nu}_e} n_{\\bar{\\nu}_e} E_{\\bar{\\nu}_e})\n    - (Q^{\\mathrm{eff}}_{\\nu_e} + Q^{\\mathrm{eff}}_{\\bar{\\nu}_e} + Q^{\\mathrm{eff}}_{\\nu_x})\\,,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Q=(\\kappa_{\\nu_{e}}n_{\\nu_{e}}E_{\\nu_{e}}+\\kappa_{\\bar{\\nu}_{e}}n_{\\bar{\\nu}_{%&#10;e}}E_{\\bar{\\nu}_{e}})-(Q^{\\mathrm{eff}}_{\\nu_{e}}+Q^{\\mathrm{eff}}_{\\bar{\\nu}_%&#10;{e}}+Q^{\\mathrm{eff}}_{\\nu_{x}})\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03ba</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03ba</mi><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>e</mi></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>e</mi></msub></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>e</mi></msub></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>Q</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mi>eff</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>Q</mi><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>e</mi></msub><mi>eff</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>Q</mi><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>x</mi></msub><mi>eff</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02426.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $M_{\\mathrm{ej}}$ is the ejected mass, $\\kappa$ is an effective opacity of\nthe ejecta, and $\\langle v_\\infty \\rangle$ is the mass-averaged asymptotic\nvelocity of the outflow.

One describing two \\acp{NS}\non Newtonian parabolic orbits with varying (Newtonian) periastron radius $r_p$,\nand another family describing binaries in quasi-circular (low eccentricity)\norbits. In both cases, we fix the mass ratio to one (equal mass binaries). A\nsummary of all evolved models is presented in Tab. \\ref{tab:models}.\n\nWe construct the eccentric initial data using binaries where each star has\ngravitational mass at infinite separation $M_\\infty = 1.389\\ M_\\odot$ and\nbaryonic mass $M_b = 1.522\\ M_\\odot$. We setup the initial data by superimposing\ntwo \\ac{TOV} \\citep{tolman:39, oppenheimer:39} solutions in neutrino-less beta\nequilibrium at the initial separation of $100\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 148\\ \\mathrm{km}$.\nWe set the orbital velocity of the two stars according to Newton's law to have a\nNewtonian periastron radius of $0, 5\\, M_\\odot, 7.5\\, M_\\odot, 10\\, M_\\odot$,\nand $15\\, M_\\odot$ ($\\simeq 0, 7.38\\, \\mathrm{km}, 11.08\\, \\mathrm{km}, 14.76\\,\n\\mathrm{km}$, and $22.15\\,\\mathrm{km}$).\n\nSince this construction does not yield an exact solution to Einstein equations,\nit results in violations of the Hamiltonian constraint equations that are\nbetween $1$ and $2$ orders of magnitude larger than for quasi-circular binary\ninitial data. These values are within an acceptable range in that the\nconstraints remain well behaved during the evolution. On the other hand, since\nwe do not solve for the hydrostatic equilibrium of the \\acp{NS} after boosting\nthem, this triggers oscillations in the two \\acp{NS} with typical amplitudes\n$\\delta \\rho_{\\max}/\\rho_{\\max} \\sim 0.15$. More accurate initial data could be\nobtained using the methods described in \\citet{east:12c} or\n\\citet{moldenhauer:14}. Alternatively, the errors in the constraint could be\nmitigated adopting constraint-damping formulations of the Einstein equations\n\\citep{bernuzzi:10, weyhausen:11, alic:11a, hildich:13, alic:13, kastaun:13}.\nNote, however, that none of these methods, with the exception of\n\\citet{moldenhauer:14}, solves for the hydrostatic equilibrium and can remove\nall of the oscillations. We leave the investigation of these methods to future\nwork.\n\nWe construct the quasi-circular (low eccentricity) initial data using the\n\\texttt{LORENE} pseudo-spectral elliptic solver \\citep{gourgoulhon:01}. We setup\nirrotational initial data at a separation of $45\\ \\mathrm{km}$ consisting of\n\\acp{NS} each having gravitational mass at infinite separation $M_\\infty =\n1.384\\ M_\\odot$ and baryonic mass $M_b = 1.515\\ M_\\odot$.\n\nFor the evolution we make use of the \\ac{AMR} capabilities provided by the\n\\texttt{Carpet} \\citep{schnetter:03b} mesh refinement driver for \\texttt{Cactus}\n\\citep{goodale:03}. During the inspiral, we employ a grid composed of 5\nrefinement levels with the finest ones composed of boxes that move to follow the\ncenters of the two \\acp{NS}. After merger, we switch to a fixed grid, also\ncomposed of 5 refinement levels. In both cases, the finest grid, which covers\nthe two neutron stars and the merger remnant, has a grid spacing of $h = 0.145\\\nM_\\odot \\simeq 215\\ \\mathrm{m}$. We also perform a simulation at lower\nresolution with $h = 0.25\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 369\\ \\mathrm{m}$ to estimate\nfinite-resolution effects on our simulations. To reduce the computational cost,\nwe exploit the symmetries of the problem to restrict our calculations to $x \\geq\n0$, $z \\geq 0$: rotational symmetry is used across the $yz-$plane and reflection\nsymmetry is uses across the $xz-$plane.\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\n\n\\subsection{Overall Dynamics}\n\\label{sec:results.dynamics}\nEccentric and quasi-circular \\ac{BNS} mergers have rich dynamics that can lead\nto a number of outcomes depending on the \\ac{EOS}, masses, and orbital\nparameters of the binary \\citep{shibata:06, baiotti:08, rezzolla:10, gold:12,\neast:12b, paschalidis:15, east:15b}. This is also reflected in the dynamics of\nour simulations. Binaries with small Newtonian periastron radii (\\texttt{RP0} --\nhead-on collision -- and \\texttt{RP5}) result in prompt \\ac{BH} formation and\nnegligible amount of unbound mass. Binaries with larger Newtonian periastron\nradii, {\\textit{e.g.}}, \\texttt{RP7.5}, and quasi-circular binaries (\\texttt{QC}) result in\nthe formation of \\acp{HMNS} \\citep{baumgarte:00}, meta-stable massive remnants\ntemporarily supported against gravitational collapse by a large degree of\ndifferential rotation \\citep{baiotti:08, kaplan:14}. Binaries with\nlarger Newtonian periastron radii (models \\texttt{RP10} and \\texttt{RP15})\nresult in multiple close encounters.  The \\texttt{RP10} model, in particular,\nhas a very complex dynamics and undergoes three close encounters, before finally\nmerging after the third encounter. The \\texttt{RP15} model is also expected to\nundergo multiple encounters, however the timescales between successive\nencounters is too long to be simulated with our methods, so we only consider its\nfirst close passage.\n\nThe orbital dynamics of the \\texttt{RP10} model appears to be very sensitive to\nsmall changes in the simulation inputs and, in our preliminary tests, we\nobserved differences in the timing and number of encounters with changes in the\nnumerical parameters ({\\textit{e.g.}}, resolution). A similar behavior is also observed in\neccentric binary \\ac{BH}s encounters \\citep{damour:14, guercilena:15}. For this\nreason, the \\texttt{RP10} simulations should be considered as particular\nrealizations of the dynamics close to the threshold between direct merger and\nmultiple encounters and not necessarily as the outcomes of encounters with $r_p$\nexactly equal to $10\\ M_\\odot$. Indeed, the precise \\emph{value} of this\nthreshold is probably the imprint of our numerical setup and is likely to change\nonce this setup is varied. On the other hand, the \\emph{existence} of such a\nthreshold will not depend on the numerical details.  The orbital dynamics of the\nother binaries, instead, appears robust.  The accuracy of numerical relativity\nsimulations of quasi-circular \\ac{BNS} inspirals has been studied in detail in\nthe past (\\mbox{\\citealt{baiotti:09};} \\citealt{baiotti:10, bernuzzi:12,\nradice:14a, radice:14b, radice:15b}).\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig01.pdf}\n  \\caption{Rest-mass density (equation \\ref{eq:rmd}) in the orbital plane for\n  the parabolic encounter simulation \\texttt{LK\\_RP10} at six different times.\n  The \\ac{NS}s undergo three close encounters before merging.

During the periastron passage strong tidal torques and shocks result\nin episodic outflow events. Part of the ejected neutron-rich matter is unbound\nfrom the system (more on this in Sect. \\ref{sec:results.ejecta}), while the rest\nsettles in a thick atmosphere around the \\ac{NS}s. The atmosphere is mostly\nthermally supported in the purely hydrodynamic \\texttt{HY\\_RP10} simulation, but\nnot in the simulations which include neutrino cooling. In the latter cases, the\n``envelope'' around the binary has time to cool and partly accrete back onto the\n\\ac{NS}s in the time between successive encounters.  This results in the\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP10} simulation undergoing its last encounter $\\sim 2\\ \\mathrm{ms}$\nbefore \\texttt{HY\\_RP10}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig02.pdf}\n  \\caption{Real part of the $\\ell = 2,\\ m = 2$ spin-weighted spherical harmonics\n  component of the Weyl scalar $\\Psi_4$ for the \\texttt{LK\\_RP10}, extracted at\n  $r_\\star = 400\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 590\\ \\mathrm{km}$. The curvature \\ac{GW} signal\n  shows a burst after the first encounter that excites violent oscillations in\n  the two \\ac{NS}s. These oscillations are then suppressed by tidal interactions\n  during the second encounter. The \\ac{GW} signal turns on again at merger.}\n  \\label{fig:psi4}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe encounters also excite oscillations of the two \\acp{NS}, which result in\ncopious \\ac{GW} emission. This phenomenon has been previously reported in\nsimulations employing idealized \\ac{EOS} \\citep{gold:12, east:12b} and studied\nin detail by \\citet{gold:12}. They showed that tidal interactions during close\nencounters can excite the fundamental modes of oscillation of the two \\acp{NS}.\nThis is apparent in our \\texttt{RP10} model whose curvature \\ac{GW} signal, the\nWeyl scalar $\\Psi_4$\\footnote{We remind the reader that the complex scalar\n$\\Psi_4$ combines the second time derivatives of the two strain polarizations\n\\mbox{$\\Psi_4 = \\ddot{h}_+ - \\mathrm{i}\\, \\ddot{h}_\\times$}.}, is shown in Fig.\n\\ref{fig:psi4}. The first encounter is accompanied by a burst in \\acp{GW}\nfollowed by a quasi-periodic signal lasting about $\\sim 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, {\\textit{i.e.}},\nup to the time of the second encounter. For all of the \\texttt{RP10}\nsimulations, we find the interaction between the two \\acp{NS} during the second\nencounter to suppress the oscillations of the two stars leading to a sudden\nshutdown of the \\ac{GW} emission. This is an effect that has not been reported\nbefore. However, it may be a consequence of the $\\pi-$symmetry imposed during\nthe evolution.  More simulations would be required to address this question. A\nsecond, sudden, burst in \\acp{GW} appears at the time of merger.\n\nLike the orbital dynamics of the binaries before the merger, also their\npost-merger evolution shows a large variety. As discussed above, the merger can\nresult in prompt \\ac{BH} formation for binaries with little angular momentum\n(\\texttt{RP0}, \\texttt{RP5}) or in the formation of a \\ac{HMNS}.  Furthermore,\nsince different models merge with different amount of residual angular momentum\nand mass, the structure and rotational configuration of the \\ac{HMNS} can vary\nsignificantly leading to different evolutionary paths.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig03.pdf}\n  \\caption{Maximum rest-mass density (equation \\ref{eq:rmd}) as a function of\n  time for the simulations with neutrino cooling, \\texttt{LK} runs. The\n  \\texttt{LK\\_RP} runs are with eccentric binaries, while the \\texttt{LK\\_QC} is\n  quasi-circular. Although all of the models have almost the same mass and we\n  use a single \\ac{EOS}, there is significant variability in the outcome of the\n  merger due to the differences in the amount of angular momentum of the binary\n  at merger.}\n  \\label{fig:rhoc}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThis is summarized in Fig. \\ref{fig:rhoc}, where we show the maximum rest-mass\ndensity as a function of time for a group of representative simulations. The\n\\texttt{RP5} model exhibits prompt collapse: the central density rapidly grows\nuntil an apparent horizon is formed. After the formation of the apparent\nhorizon, $\\rho_{\\max}$ appears to drop, because we exclude the region inside the\n\\ac{BH} in the calculation of the maximum density. The \\texttt{RP7.5} model\nexperiences a rather violent merger: the two stellar cores collide, slightly\novershoot each other, and then merge again after $\\sim 2\\ \\mathrm{ms}$. In\ncomparison, the quasi-circular model \\texttt{QC} experiences a much milder\nmerger, with a smaller initial jump in the density. However, since the\n\\texttt{QC} binaries merge with smaller residual total angular momentum than the\n\\texttt{RP7.5} binaries, the resulting \\ac{HMNS} contracts and oscillates\nviolently before collapsing to a \\ac{BH} within $\\sim 10\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ after\nmerger. Finally, the \\texttt{RP10} binary merges with a large amount of residual\nangular momentum, which sustains the hypermassive merger remnant over the entire\nsimulated time ($\\gtrsim 20\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ after merger).\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig04.pdf}\n  \\caption{Neutrino luminosity for runs \\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5}, \\texttt{LK\\_RP10},\n  and \\texttt{LK\\_QC}. \\emph{Left panel:} electron neutrino luminosity.\n  \\emph{Middle panel:} electron anti-neutrino luminosity. \\emph{Right panel:}\n  total luminosity from heavy lepton ($\\mu, \\bar{\\mu}, \\tau, \\bar{\\tau}$)\n  neutrinos.  Models with small periastron radius, such as \\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5},\n  result in violent mergers with very bright neutrino bursts.}\n  \\label{fig:luminosity}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe diversity in the merger dynamics is also reflected in the neutrino signals\nshown in Fig. \\ref{fig:luminosity}. The violent merger in the\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5} simulation results in neutrino luminosities in excess of\n$10^{54}\\ \\mathrm{erg}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ sustained over multiple milliseconds.\nThese luminosities are comparable to those reported by \\citet{rosswog:13}, who,\nhowever, performed simulations using Newtonian gravity and a different nuclear\n\\ac{EOS}. These luminosities are almost an order of magnitude larger than for\nour fiducial quasi-circular simulation (model \\texttt{QC\\_LK}). The\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP10} simulation displays sudden rises in its neutrino emissions in\ncoincidence with each close encounter, followed by cooling phases where the\nluminosity drops exponentially in time. Finally, the \\texttt{QC\\_LK} run shows a\nsingle burst in its neutrino emission at the time of merger, followed by a rapid\ndecay in its luminosity as soon as the \\ac{HMNS} collapses to a \\ac{BH}. The\nearly time, $t \\lesssim 12\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, neutrino emissions from the\n\\texttt{QC\\_LK} simulation are due to the spurious heating of the surface of the\ntwo \\acp{NS} caused by our numerical scheme. These early-time neutrino energy\nlosses might appear large, but they are actually not dynamically important as\nthey are $\\sim 2$ orders of magnitude smaller than the \\ac{GW} luminosity, which\npeaks at $\\sim 2\\times 10^{55}\\ \\mathrm{erg}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at the time of\nmerger.\n\n\\subsection{Dynamical Ejecta}\n\\label{sec:results.ejecta}\n\\subsubsection{Ejected Mass}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig05.pdf}\n  \\caption{Dynamically ejected mass for all simulations as a function of the\n  Newtonian periastron radius $r_p$. The ejecta mass is computed integrating in\n  time the flux of unbound matter (with $u_t \\leq -1$) across the surface of a\n  spherical sphere with radius $r = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$. The\n  horizontal lines denote the ejected mass from the quasi-circular runs. The\n  ejecta for models with $r_p = 0$ and $r_p = 15\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 14.78\\\n  \\mathrm{km}$ are under-resolved and should not be taken at face value.\n  Overall, eccentric binaries can eject up to $2$ orders of magnitude more mass\n  than quasi-circular binaries.}\n  \\label{fig:ejecta.mass}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\noindent Being on Newtonian parabolic orbits, our eccentric \\ac{BNS} binaries\nare only weakly bound. For this reason, it is not surprising to find that they\ncan unbind a significantly larger amount of matter compared to quasi-circular\nmergers.  Figure \\ref{fig:ejecta.mass} shows the total amount of unbound matter\nfor each of our simulations (also reported in Tab. \\ref{tab:models}). The total\nejected rest mass is computed integrating in time the flux of matter with $u_t\n\\leq -1$\\footnote{See \\citet{kastaun:15} for a discussion of possible\nalternative criteria to identify unbound fluid elements.} across a spherical\ncoordinate surface with radius $200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$.  Note\nthat these estimates do not include late-time mass ejection driven by neutrino,\nviscous heating, and/or magnetic pressure, which would take place on longer\ntimescales \\citep{dessart:09, fernandez:13, siegel:14, metzger:14, fernandez:14,\nrezzolla:14, ciolfi:14, fernandez:15, just:15a, martin:15, kiuchi:15a}. The\ndynamical mass ejection in our simulations is impulsive and concentrated in one\nor, in the \\texttt{RP10} models, three ejection events lasting only several\nmilliseconds. For this reason, our measure of the dynamically ejected mass is\nrobust with respect to the physical time covered by our simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome interesting trends can be observed from Fig. \\ref{fig:ejecta.mass}.  First\nof all, we find that eccentric mergers, and in particular mergers with impact\nparameters close to the threshold between prompt merger and multiple-encounters,\nseem to be those resulting in the largest mass ejection.  This is similar to\nwhat was found by \\citet{east:12b}. Note that the \\texttt{RP15} model is likely\nto experience more mass ejection in its successive encounters, which will happen\nover timescales that we cannot simulate directly.  Nevertheless, we still expect\nencounters such as that of the \\texttt{LK\\_RP15} run to yield lower ejecta mass\ncompared to encounters resulting in mergers over a short dynamical timescale,\nsuch as \\texttt{RP7.5} and \\texttt{RP10}. The reason for this is that model\n\\texttt{RP15} will undergo merger in a more gravitationally bound state than\nmodel \\texttt{RP7.5} or model \\texttt{RP10}. As a consequence, we conjecture on\nthe basis of our data that eccentric \\ac{BNS} mergers can yield up to $\\sim 0.1\\\nM_\\odot$ of ejecta, slightly less than what can be achieved with \\ac{BHNS}\nmergers \\citep{foucart:14, kyutoku:15}, but almost two orders of magnitude\nlarger than what is ejected by mergers of BNSs in quasi-circular orbits.\n\nWe find significant differences between the \\texttt{LK} results, which include\nneutrino cooling, and the \\texttt{HY}, which neglect it. For all our models we\nfind that neglecting neutrino cooling results in an overestimate of the unbound\nmass by a factor $\\gtrsim 2$. This hints at the importance of neutrino-radiation\nprocesses in shaping the outflows from these mergers. As documented in detail by\n\\citet{hotokezaka:13} and \\citet{bauswein:13}, a significant fraction of the\nejecta in \\ac{GR} simulations is driven by shocks.  In our simulations neutrino\nlosses in the optically thin outflows are rapid and sufficient to cause part of\nthe material to become gravitationally bound again by removing part of its\ninternal energy. In addition, the total amount of mass ejected by the\n\\texttt{RP10} binaries is also affected by the cooling of the thick atmosphere\ngenerated during the first encounter of the two \\acp{NS}, which is suppressed in\nthe \\texttt{HY\\_RP10} run, as discussed in Sect.  \\ref{sec:results.dynamics}.\n\nThe differences between models including only cooling (\\texttt{LK}) and models\nalso including heating (\\texttt{M0}) are also important, but less striking. We\nfind that, for most models, the inclusion of heating results in a slight\nincrease of the total ejected mass. The only exception is the quasi-circular\nbinary (\\texttt{QC}), for which turning on heating results in an reduction of\nthe ejected mass by a factor $\\sim 2$. At first, immediately after the merger,\nthe \\texttt{M0\\_QC} simulation shows a slightly larger outflow rate than the\n\\texttt{LK\\_QC} run. However, by the time the outflow rate of \\texttt{LK\\_QC}\npeaks, the \\texttt{M0\\_QC} shows a sudden decrease in the ejection rate.  The\nreason seems to be that, in the latter, part of the shock-driven outflow ends up\ncolliding with the gravitationally bound part of the tidal tail. This tail has a\nlarger vertical extent when heating is turned on and the interaction between it\nand the shock-driven outflows prevents the latter from being ejected. This is\nreflected by the lack of ejecta at intermediate latitudes ($45^\\circ \\lesssim\n\\theta \\lesssim 80^\\circ$) in the \\texttt{M0\\_QC} run (see Fig.\n\\ref{fig:histograms}; bottom row). Note that we do not necessarily expect this\nto be a generic feature in quasi-circular \\ac{BNS} mergers. This is also\ndifferent from what was reported by \\citet{sekiguchi:15}, who always found an\nincrease in the total ejected mass when heating was included. It is, however, a\nclear indication that neutrino radiation likely plays an important role also in\nshaping the non-linear dynamics of the bulk of these outflows and not just their\ncomposition.\n\n\\subsubsection{Properties of the Outflow}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07a.pdf}\\[1em]\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07b.pdf}\\[1em]\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07c.pdf}\\[1em]\n    \\includegraphics[width=2\\columnwidth]{fig07d.pdf}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{Electron fraction (\\emph{top row}), specific entropy per baryon\n  (\\emph{second row}), asymptotic velocity (\\emph{third row}), and angular\n  distribution (\\emph{bottom row}) of the ejecta. $\\theta$ is the angle from the\n  orbital plane. The first, second, and third columns show results from models\n  \\texttt{RP7.5}, \\texttt{RP10}, and \\texttt{QC} respectively. For each\n  configuration we consider three different levels of microphysical description:\n  pure hydrodynamics (\\texttt{HY}), neutrino cooling (\\texttt{LK}), or neutrino\n  cooling and heating (\\texttt{M0}). The histograms are computed from the mass\n  fraction of the matter crossing a spherical surface at radius $r = 200\\\n  M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$ with positive specific energy ({\\textit{i.e.}}, with $u_t\n  \\leq -1$). The bump in the angular distribution at $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ is a\n  numerical artefact generated by our Cartesian simulation grid.}\n  \\label{fig:histograms}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent We collect composition, specific entropy, asymptotic velocity and\nangular distribution of the ejecta for the three most interesting models,\n\\texttt{RP7.5} (representative of a violent collision), \\texttt{RP10}\n(representative of the dynamics with multiple encounters), and \\texttt{QC} (our\nfiducial quasi-circular binary) in Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}. The histograms are\ngenerated by binning the properties of the unbound matter (with $u_t \\leq -1$)\nflowing through a coordinate sphere with radius $r = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\\n\\mathrm{km}$. As can be seen from Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}, morphology and\nthermodynamical properties of the ejecta show large variations with binary\nconfiguration and neutrino treatment. This is a consequence of the complex\ninterplay, between radiation and hydrodynamics, that controls the mass ejection.\n\nThe electron fraction of the ejecta is one of the most important quantities\ndetermining both the outcome of the nucleosynthesis (more in Sect.\n\\ref{sec:results.nucleosynthesis}) and the properties of the \\ac{EM} signature\nof the merger (see Sect. \\ref{sec:results.EM}). It is also the quantity showing\nthe greatest variation. Simulations neglecting all weak interactions are,\nunsurprisingly, characterized by extremely neutron-rich ejecta. In these\nsimulations, $Y_e$ is simply advected with the flow and unchanged. On the other\nhand, when weak interactions are included, $Y_e$ can evolve due to electron or\npositron captures in shock-heated material (in the \\texttt{LK} and \\texttt{M0}\nsimulations) and due to neutrino absorption (in the \\texttt{M0} simulations). As\na consequence, simulations accounting for weak interactions show a much wider\nrange of electron fractions.\n\nIndependent of binary parameters, we find the ejecta to have a clear bi-modal\ndistribution in $Y_e$. Part of the outflow, driven by tidal torques, is cold and\nneutron rich, while another component, launched by shocks during merger,\nexperiences high-temperatures and rapid protonization with values of $Y_e$\npeaking at $\\sim 0.16$. The \\texttt{M0} simulations also show a relatively\nproton-rich $Y_e \\simeq 0.4$ component of the outflow, predominantly at high\nlatitudes (more on this later). The final mass distribution of $Y_e$ depends on\nthe relative importance of these different components.\n\nThe composition of the ejecta from our simulations is somewhat more neutron rich\nthan that of \\citet{wanajo:14} and \\citet{sekiguchi:15}. These studies appear to\nbe lacking any cold component in their outflows. This might be a consequence of\nthe different treatment of the neutrino radiation or of the choice of \\ac{EOS}.\nInstead, we find good qualitative agreement between our \\texttt{LK\\_QC} results\nand those of \\citet{palenzuela:15}, who adopted different \\ac{EOS}, but a\nneutrino cooling treatment very similar to ours. Our ejecta are also\nsignificantly more proton-rich than those typically found in Newtonian\nsimulations \\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{rosswog:13}, where the tidal component is enhanced\nwith respect to \\ac{GR} simulations \\citep{bauswein:13}.\n\nThe composition of the ejecta differs between eccentric and quasi-circular\nmergers. The reason for this is that eccentric mergers producing large ejecta\nmass do so mostly as a consequence of the enhanced tidal interaction between the\ntwo \\ac{NS}s during close passages. As a consequence, only nearly head-on\ncollisions (model \\texttt{RP5}) result in more proton-rich ejecta than the\n\\texttt{QC} binaries (see Tab. \\ref{tab:models}). This trend is the\n\\emph{opposite} of what has been reported in Newtonian simulations, where\nquasi-circular binaries are dominated by tidal ejecta with low-$Y_e$ and\neccentric binaries by shock-heated, high-$Y_e$, ejecta \\citep{rosswog:13}. The\n\\texttt{LK\\_RP7.5} simulation has ejecta composition that is very similar to\nthat of the quasi-circular \\texttt{LK\\_QC}, while the multiple encounter\nsimulation \\texttt{LK\\_RP10} has significantly more neutron rich ejecta than\nboth.\n\nThe effect of neutrino absorption on the electron fraction is non-negligible, as\nalso found by \\citet{wanajo:14}, \\citet{sekiguchi:15}, and \\citet{foucart:15b},\nalthough in our simulations the impact is less significant than in these\nprevious studies. The \\texttt{M0} runs have more proton rich ejecta than the\n\\texttt{LK} simulations, but the differences appear to be mostly confined to the\ntail of the ejecta distribution in $Y_e$, while the mass-weighted average of the\nelectron fraction $\\langle Y_e \\rangle$ is not strongly affected ({\\textit{cf.}}, Tab.\n\\ref{tab:models} and Fig.  \\ref{fig:histograms}).\n\nAs can be seen from the second row of Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}, the specific\nentropy per baryon of the ejecta shows somewhat smaller differences between\nsimulations than $Y_e$. The overall trend is that runs that include neutrino\ncooling effects (\\texttt{LK} and \\texttt{M0}) display lower specific entropies\nthan purely hydrodynamical models, which overestimate the final entropy of the\nshock-heated ejecta.\n\nWe find the bulk of the outflow to be sub-relativistic with asymptotic\nvelocities $v_\\infty \\lesssim c/3$ (third row of Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}) for\nboth eccentric and quasi-circular models. This is in contrast with Newtonian\nsimulations \\citep{rosswog:13}, but is similar to other \\ac{GR} studies\n\\citep{east:12b, sekiguchi:15, east:15b}. There are some differences in the\nasymptotic velocities between \\texttt{HY}, \\texttt{LK}, and \\texttt{M0}\nsimulations, but there is no clear trend.\n\nWe show the angular distribution of the ejecta in the bottom row of panels in\nFig. \\ref{fig:histograms}. We find the outflow of the \\texttt{RP10} model, which\nejects matter mostly due to tidal torques during its multiple encounters, to be\nmostly contained in a narrow angle around the orbital plane. This is similar\nwhat found for the ejecta of \\ac{BHNS} mergers \\citep{foucart:14, kyutoku:15}.\nThe other models show a larger angular spread of the outflow with the bulk of\nthe ejecta appearing to be contained within an angle $\\theta \\lesssim 60^\\circ$\nof the orbital plane.  The bump in the ejecta distribution function at $\\theta =\n45^\\circ$ is a numerical artefact associated with our Cartesian simulation grid\nthat tends to funnel flows along its symmetry directions.\n\nThe amount of ejected material at high latitudes ($\\theta \\gtrsim 60^\\circ$) is\nalso strongly dependent on the included physics in our simulations. Runs that do\nnot include neutrino cooling tend to overestimate, by a factor of a few, the\namount of matter in the polar region of the post-merger remnant. Conversely,\nsimulations that include neutrino cooling, but not heating, underestimate the\nbaryon contamination of the poles by a similar factor. These differences might\nhave an impact for the simulation of \\ac{SGRB} engines, because baryon\ncontamination of the polar regions might prevent the launch of relativistic jets\nin some \\ac{SGRB} models \\citep[{\\textit{e.g.}},][]{just:15b}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Ejection Mechanisms}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig08.pdf}\n  \\caption{Angular distribution (\\emph{upper half of each panel}) and\n  composition (\\emph{lower half of each panel}) of the ejecta for the\n  \\texttt{LK\\_QC} (\\emph{upper panel}) and \\texttt{M0\\_QC} (\\emph{lower panel})\n  simulations as a function of time. The data is collected on a coordinate\n  sphere at radius $r = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$ and only considers\n  the unbound part of the outflow ({\\textit{i.e.}}, with $u_t \\leq -1$). The gray shaded\n  areas refer to times/angles for which we do not measure any outflow of unbound\n  matter ({\\textit{i.e.}}, where $u_t > -1$). The ejection event is of very short duration\n  and the outflow is confined within a broad $\\sim 60^\\circ$ angle from the\n  equator.  The material at low altitudes is typically more neutron rich than at\n  higher altitudes, suggesting a different ejection mechanisms for the different\n  components of the outflow.}\n  \\label{fig:ejecta.profile}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent In Fig. \\ref{fig:ejecta.profile}, we show the angular density and\n$Y_e$ distribution of the ejecta for two of the quasi-circular \\ac{BNS}\nsimulations: \\texttt{LK\\_QC} and \\texttt{M0\\_QC}. These profiles hint at the\ninterplay between a few distinct mechanism for the dynamical ejection of \\ac{NS}\nmatter. A first component of the outflow is driven by tidal interactions between\nthe \\acp{NS}. It is very neutron rich, with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.1$, and confined in\na narrow $\\sim 20^\\circ$ angle from the orbital plane. In our simulations, this\nis the first component to reach the fiducial outflow surface at $t \\simeq 16\\\n\\mathrm{ms}$ ({\\textit{i.e.}}, $\\simeq 3\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ after the merger; consistent with an\noutflow velocity of $\\sim c/3$). This component is present in all of our\nsimulations, regardless of their level of microphysical description.\n\nA second component is driven by shocks launched during merger. It is less\nneutron rich, with $Y_e \\sim 0.15$, and more isotropic, spanning an angular\nregion of about $60^\\circ$ from the orbital plane. Shock driven ejecta lag the\ntidal tails by a few ms. As previously discussed, the quasi-circular binary with\nneutrino cooling, but not heating (\\texttt{LK\\_QC}), is able to unbind more\nmaterial than the one with also heating included (\\texttt{M0\\_QC}). This is a\nconsequence of the different non-linear hydrodynamics evolution of the two\noutflows.\n\nFinally, a third component is constituted by a high-latitude wind driven by a\ncombination of shock and neutrino heating. This component is relatively proton\nrich with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.25$. It is mostly absent in the \\texttt{LK\\_QC}\nsimulation, but becomes the dominant outflow component after $t \\simeq 21\\\n\\mathrm{ms}$ in the \\texttt{M0\\_QC} run.\n\nThe interplay between low-$Y_e$ (close to the equator) and high-$Y_e$ (at high\nlatitudes) ejecta is what determines the final electron fraction distribution of\nthe ejecta (Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}) and the r-process yields (more in Sect.\n\\ref{sec:results.nucleosynthesis}).\n\n\\subsection{Nucleosynthesis}\n\\label{sec:results.nucleosynthesis}\nAs the material ejected during merger expands, it undergoes neutron capture\nnucleosynthesis, which may produce r-process elements.  In order to estimate the\nfinal nucleosynthetic yields of our simulations, we map our ejecta data onto the\ngrid of parametrized r-process calculations presented in \\citet{lippuner:15}.\nFirst, we extract $Y_e$, $s$, $v$, and $\\rho$ for all of the unbound matter\n(with $u_t \\leq -1$) as it flows across the surface of a coordinate sphere of\nradius $r_E = 200\\ M_\\odot \\simeq 295\\ \\mathrm{km}$.  To estimate the\nnucleosynthesis in the outflow using our nucleosynthesis grid, the dynamical\ntimescale, $\\tau$, of each ejected fluid element is required.  To estimate\n$\\tau$, we assume that the material crossing our extraction surface is expanding\nhomologously.  This assumption should be relatively well satisfied by our data\ngiven that, by the time the ejecta reach the detection surface, their density\nhas already dropped by $\\sim 3$ orders of magnitude.  Then, the density history\nfor a particular element of the ejecta is given by $\\rho(t) = \\rho_E (v_E\nt/r_E)^{-3}$, where $\\rho_E$ and $v_E$ are the density and velocity of the fluid\nelement when it crosses a sphere of radius $r_E$.  At late times, the density\nhistory used in \\citet{lippuner:15} has the form $\\rho(t)=\\rho(s, Y_e, T=6 \\,\n\\textrm{GK}) (3\\tau/et)^3$, where $e$ is Euler's number.  We match these two\nprofiles to extract $\\tau$. The final yields are then found by multiplying the\nyields computed by \\citet{lippuner:15} at each point in their nucleosynthesis\ngrid with the total mass associated with it.  Such a procedure is necessarily\napproximate, but it enables the rapid calculation of the abundance distribution\nin the ejecta without the need for tracer particles.  Future work should\ndirectly compare this method of yield estimation to more detailed\ntracer-particle based methods.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{fig09.pdf}\n  \\caption{Final abundances in the ejecta for the \\texttt{RP7.5}, \\texttt{RP10}\n  and \\texttt{QC} configurations. The yields are normalized with the total\n  abundance of elements with $63 \\leq A \\leq 209$. For each configuration we\n  consider three different levels of microphysical description (pure\n  hydrodynamics, \\texttt{HY} or leakage with only cooling, \\texttt{LK}, or with\n  heating/absorption included, \\texttt{M0}). The abundance pattern for elements\n  with $A\\gtrsim 120$ is very robust and in overall good agreement with the\n  Solar r-process abundances taken from \\citet{arlandini:99}.} \\label{fig:ejecta.yields}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{fig10.pdf}\n  \\caption{Joint distribution of composition and entropy for the \\texttt{M0\\_QC}\n  simulation. The material to the left of the dashed contour line produces second\n  and third r-process nucleosynthesis, while material to the left of the solid\n  contour line only produces first peak r-process nucleosynthesis. The figure\n  also hints at the existence of a correlation between $Y_e$ and $s$ as larger\n  proton fractions are typically found in combination with high entropies.}\n  \\label{fig:ejecta.corr}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe show the results of this procedure in Fig. \\ref{fig:ejecta.yields}, where we\nplot the relative abundances of different elements in the final composition of\nthe ejecta for three of our models (\\texttt{RP7.5}, \\texttt{RP10}, and\n\\texttt{QC}) and with three different levels of microphysical description\n(\\texttt{HY}, \\texttt{LK}, and \\texttt{M0}).  The dynamical ejecta from all our\nsimulations is neutron rich with mass-averaged electron fractions $\\langle Y_e\n\\rangle \\lesssim 0.2$ (see Fig. \\ref{fig:histograms}).  We show the joint\ndistribution of $Y_e$ and specific entropy per baryon $s$ for simulation\n\\texttt{QC\\_M0} in Fig.  \\ref{fig:ejecta.corr}.  There is an approximate\ncorrelation between $Y_e$ and $s$, due to the fact that shock heated material\nundergoes more weak processing. However, the critical electron fraction for\nproducing third-peak r-process elements is relatively insensitive to $s$ (see\nthe contour lines in Fig.  \\ref{fig:ejecta.corr}).  The bulk of the ejecta lies\nin a region of parameter space where a robust r-process will occur.  In fact, we\nfind that fission cycling occurs in most of the material.  As a result, we find\nthe relative abundances for $A \\gtrsim 120$ to be robust and close to Solar,\nregardless of the merger type (eccentric vs.~quasi-circular) and of the neutrino\ntreatment. The only minor difference we find is that eccentric mergers show a\nslight increase in the production of third-peak region nuclei, due to their more\nneutron-rich ejecta.\n\nThe yields for $50 \\lesssim A \\lesssim 90$, referred to here as the first-peak\nregion, show greater variability than the yields at larger $A$.  Material in\nthis atomic mass range is produced in ejecta with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.22$, where an\nincomplete r-process occurs.  Material quickly builds up in the first and second\npeaks and then gets left there due to early neutron exhaustion.  The amount of\nmaterial with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.22$ is sensitive to both the binary parameters and\nthe treatment of neutrinos.  Without weak interactions, in the \\texttt{HY}\nmodels, almost all of the ejected material undergoes a complete r-process for\nall of the binaries.  In the models including electron and positron captures but\nnot neutrino captures (\\texttt{LK}), there is less first peak region material\nfor the eccentric \\ac{BNS} mergers, which have slightly more neutron rich ejecta\nthan the quasi-circular mergers.  The further inclusion of neutrino captures in\nthe \\texttt{M0} models has the largest impact on the yields of the \\texttt{QC}\nmodel. This is likely due to its low average ejecta velocity compared with the\neccentric mergers.  Nonetheless, neutrino captures only have a moderate impact\non the final yields for all simulated binaries.\n\nBecause of the small amount of mass in the high $Y_e$ tail of our ejecta,\nfirst-peak nuclei are underproduced with respect to the Solar abundances (when\nnormalizing to the second r-process peak).  Therefore, we cannot account for all\nof the r-process yields in the dynamical ejecta of binary neutron star mergers.\nThis is in contrast with the results of \\cite{wanajo:14}, who found first-peak\nregion nuclei to be produced in approximately Solar proportion.  Their\nsimulations yield a much wider distribution of $Y_e$ than ours and a larger\nfraction of their ejecta undergoes an incomplete r-process.

We considered both mergers\nof binaries in quasi-circular orbits and of eccentric binaries produced through\ndynamical capture in dense stellar environments. We systematically varied the\nlevel of our treatment of weak reactions in our simulations to isolate the\nimpact of neutrino emission and absorption on the composition and morphology of\nthe outflows.\n\nWe identify three main components of the dynamical ejecta in our simulations.  A\nfirst component, driven by tidal interactions between the two \\acp{NS}, is cold\nand very neutron rich (with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.1$), and it is confined within $\\sim\n20^\\circ$ of the orbital plane. A second component is driven by shocks formed\nduring the merger and is less neutron rich with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.15$, but more\nisotropic, being spread over an angle of $\\sim 60^\\circ$ from the orbital plane.\nA third, relatively proton-rich, with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.25$, but very tenuous,\ncomponent is observed at high-latitudes, especially in simulations that include\nneutrino heating. The relative importance of each of these components varies\nbetween the simulations and is the result of the interplay between the bulk\ndynamics and the effects of neutrino transport. All of the ejecta are\nsub-relativistic with $\\langle v_\\infty \\rangle \\lesssim c/3$ for all but the\nmost extreme, nearly head-on, configurations, which, however, result in very\nlittle ejecta, because of prompt \\ac{BH} formation.\n\nIn agreement with previous work \\citep{east:12b, rosswog:13}, we find that\neccentric binaries can eject orders of magnitude more mass than binaries in\nquasi-circular orbits and only slightly less than \\ac{BHNS} binaries. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, and different from Newtonian results \\citep{rosswog:13}, we find\nthat the ejecta from eccentric mergers are typically more neutron rich than\nthose of quasi-circular mergers. The reason for this is that the ejecta in\neccentric mergers is increasingly dominated by the tidal component. This trend\nis the opposite of what is found in Newtonian simulations by \\citet{rosswog:13},\nwhich found eccentric mergers to yield more proton-rich outflows than\nquasi-circular mergers. The reason for this difference is that, on the one hand,\nNewtonian calculations tend to overestimate the relative ratio of tidally- to\nshock-driven ejecta for quasi-circular binaries \\citep{bauswein:13}. On the\nother hand, Newtonian studies also overestimate the amount of shocked ejecta for\neccentric binaries.\n\nOur results also indicate that neutrino cooling and heating have an important\nimpact on the composition, morphology, and total mass of the outflows.\nSimulations performed neglecting neutrino cooling and heating consistently\noverestimate ejecta masses by a factor of $\\sim 2$ or more. They also\nover-predict the amount of mass ejected at high-latitudes by a factor of a few.\nGiven the impact that baryonic pollution in the polar regions of \\ac{SGRB}\nengines may have \\citep{just:15b}, this suggests that \\ac{SGRB} engine studies\nshould use initial data from mergers simulations that included both cooling and\nheating from neutrinos.\n\nThe effect of neutrino heating on the total unbound mass is less clear, because\nit impacts different simulations in different ways. However, we find the\ndifferences between simulations including or neglecting neutrino heating to be\nsignificant enough to suggest that neutrino heating should also be accounted\nfor. The differences between simulations including heating and those neglecting\nit are particularly significant for the quasi-circular models where neutrino\nabsorption leads to qualitative changes in the outflow.\n\nThe absorption of neutrinos in the ejecta can also contribute to the\nprotonization of the outflow. We find this effect to be appreciable in our\nsimulations, although not as significant as reported by \\citet{sekiguchi:15} and\n\\citet{foucart:15b}. The absorption of neutrinos seems to be affecting the\nmass-distribution of the ejecta at high-$Y_e$, and it is especially significant\nat high latitudes. At the same time, we find the variation in the average\nelectron fraction of the ejecta to be small and, in some cases, insignificant.\nThe differences between our results and those of \\citet{sekiguchi:15} and\n\\citet{foucart:15b} could be due to the different treatments of neutrino\nradiation and hydrodynamics, or of the methodology employed in the analysis. We\nnote that we find significant discrepancies in the composition of the ejecta\nwith \\citet{sekiguchi:15}, even when comparing simulations that did not include\nheating. Instead, we find good agreement with \\citet{palenzuela:15}, who,\nhowever, used a different nuclear \\ac{EOS}.\n\nWe also find neutrino physics to have a significant impact on the basic\ncharacteristics of the \\ac{EM} counterparts from \\ac{BNS} mergers. Switching on\nneutrino cooling and heating can result in differences in the macronova peak\ntimes of several tens of percent and up to factors of a few in some cases. Even\nmore drastic is the impact of the neutrino treatment on the properties of the\nradio remnants created by the mergers. For instance, the radio fluence at $1.4\\\n\\mathrm{GHz}$ for one of our models changes by almost a factor of ten when\nneutrino cooling is switched on. This is a consequence of the fact that the\nproperties of the radio emission depend crucially on the asymptotic kinetic\nenergy of the ejecta, which, is affected by the cooling.\n\nWe estimate the nucleosynthetic yields of our simulations using the tabulated\nyields of \\citet{lippuner:15}. We find that, despite their very diverse nature,\nall considered \\ac{BNS} mergers (eccentric or quasi-circular) robustly produce\nr-process elements with atomic mass number $A\\gtrsim 120$, with relative\nabundances close to the Solar r-process abundance distribution. At the same\ntime, our yields show a deficit at lower $A$ compared to the Solar abundances.\nThis is different from what was reported by \\citet{wanajo:14}.  If confirmed,\nour results would suggest that either core-collapse supernovae or late-time\nneutrino, magnetically, and/or viscously driven winds \\citep{dessart:09,\nfernandez:13, siegel:14, metzger:14, fernandez:14, rezzolla:14, ciolfi:14,\nfernandez:15, just:15a, martin:15, kiuchi:15a} would still be needed to produce\nthe least massive of the r-process nuclei.\n\nImportant limitations of the present study are that we restricted ourselves to a\nsingle \\ac{EOS} and to equal mass binaries. We also ignored the effects of\n\\ac{NS} spin and of magnetic fields. Mass ejection may change quantitatively and\npossibly qualitatively with different \\ac{EOS} and with unequal mass binaries\n\\citep{rezzolla:10, hotokezaka:13, bauswein:13, sekiguchi:15, dietrich:15,\npalenzuela:15, foucart:15b}, or with the inclusion of spin \\citep{kastaun:15,\neast:15b}. While the pre-merger magnetic fields are probably too weak to impact\nthe dynamical ejecta in quasi-circular binaries, this might change for eccentric\nbinaries undergoing multiple encounters. This is so because magnetic fields\nmight be significantly amplified by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities\ntriggered when the two \\acp{NS} come into contact at their periastron\n\\citep{obergaulinger:10, zrake:13, kiuchi:15b}. In this way magnetic fields\ncould become dynamically relevant even before merger.  Finally, given the\nqualitative and quantitative impact that neutrino radiation has on the ejecta,\nit will be necessary to validate or replace currently employed neutrino\ntreatments with full multi-group (spectral) \\ac{GR}\nneutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics simulations.

We considered both mergers\nof binaries in quasi-circular orbits and of eccentric binaries produced through\ndynamical capture in dense stellar environments. We systematically varied the\nlevel of our treatment of weak reactions in our simulations to isolate the\nimpact of neutrino emission and absorption on the composition and morphology of\nthe outflows.\n\nWe identify three main components of the dynamical ejecta in our simulations.  A\nfirst component, driven by tidal interactions between the two \\acp{NS}, is cold\nand very neutron rich (with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.1$), and it is confined within $\\sim\n20^\\circ$ of the orbital plane. A second component is driven by shocks formed\nduring the merger and is less neutron rich with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.15$, but more\nisotropic, being spread over an angle of $\\sim 60^\\circ$ from the orbital plane.\nA third, relatively proton-rich, with $Y_e \\gtrsim 0.25$, but very tenuous,\ncomponent is observed at high-latitudes, especially in simulations that include\nneutrino heating. The relative importance of each of these components varies\nbetween the simulations and is the result of the interplay between the bulk\ndynamics and the effects of neutrino transport. All of the ejecta are\nsub-relativistic with $\\langle v_\\infty \\rangle \\lesssim c/3$ for all but the\nmost extreme, nearly head-on, configurations, which, however, result in very\nlittle ejecta, because of prompt \\ac{BH} formation.\n\nIn agreement with previous work \\citep{east:12b, rosswog:13}, we find that\neccentric binaries can eject orders of magnitude more mass than binaries in\nquasi-circular orbits and only slightly less than \\ac{BHNS} binaries. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, and different from Newtonian results \\citep{rosswog:13}, we find\nthat the ejecta from eccentric mergers are typically more neutron rich than\nthose of quasi-circular mergers. The reason for this is that the ejecta in\neccentric mergers is increasingly dominated by the tidal component. This trend\nis the opposite of what is found in Newtonian simulations by \\citet{rosswog:13},\nwhich found eccentric mergers to yield more proton-rich outflows than\nquasi-circular mergers. The reason for this difference is that, on the one hand,\nNewtonian calculations tend to overestimate the relative ratio of tidally- to\nshock-driven ejecta for quasi-circular binaries \\citep{bauswein:13}. On the\nother hand, Newtonian studies also overestimate the amount of shocked ejecta for\neccentric binaries.\n\nOur results also indicate that neutrino cooling and heating have an important\nimpact on the composition, morphology, and total mass of the outflows.\nSimulations performed neglecting neutrino cooling and heating consistently\noverestimate ejecta masses by a factor of $\\sim 2$ or more. They also\nover-predict the amount of mass ejected at high-latitudes by a factor of a few.\nGiven the impact that baryonic pollution in the polar regions of \\ac{SGRB}\nengines may have \\citep{just:15b}, this suggests that \\ac{SGRB} engine studies\nshould use initial data from mergers simulations that included both cooling and\nheating from neutrinos.\n\nThe effect of neutrino heating on the total unbound mass is less clear, because\nit impacts different simulations in different ways. However, we find the\ndifferences between simulations including or neglecting neutrino heating to be\nsignificant enough to suggest that neutrino heating should also be accounted\nfor. The differences between simulations including heating and those neglecting\nit are particularly significant for the quasi-circular models where neutrino\nabsorption leads to qualitative changes in the outflow.\n\nThe absorption of neutrinos in the ejecta can also contribute to the\nprotonization of the outflow. We find this effect to be appreciable in our\nsimulations, although not as significant as reported by \\citet{sekiguchi:15} and\n\\citet{foucart:15b}. The absorption of neutrinos seems to be affecting the\nmass-distribution of the ejecta at high-$Y_e$, and it is especially significant\nat high latitudes. At the same time, we find the variation in the average\nelectron fraction of the ejecta to be small and, in some cases, insignificant.\nThe differences between our results and those of \\citet{sekiguchi:15} and\n\\citet{foucart:15b} could be due to the different treatments of neutrino\nradiation and hydrodynamics, or of the methodology employed in the analysis. We\nnote that we find significant discrepancies in the composition of the ejecta\nwith \\citet{sekiguchi:15}, even when comparing simulations that did not include\nheating. Instead, we find good agreement with \\citet{palenzuela:15}, who,\nhowever, used a different nuclear \\ac{EOS}.\n\nWe also find neutrino physics to have a significant impact on the basic\ncharacteristics of the \\ac{EM} counterparts from \\ac{BNS} mergers. Switching on\nneutrino cooling and heating can result in differences in the macronova peak\ntimes of several tens of percent and up to factors of a few in some cases. Even\nmore drastic is the impact of the neutrino treatment on the properties of the\nradio remnants created by the mergers. For instance, the radio fluence at $1.4\\\n\\mathrm{GHz}$ for one of our models changes by almost a factor of ten when\nneutrino cooling is switched on. This is a consequence of the fact that the\nproperties of the radio emission depend crucially on the asymptotic kinetic\nenergy of the ejecta, which, is affected by the cooling.\n\nWe estimate the nucleosynthetic yields of our simulations using the tabulated\nyields of \\citet{lippuner:15}. We find that, despite their very diverse nature,\nall considered \\ac{BNS} mergers (eccentric or quasi-circular) robustly produce\nr-process elements with atomic mass number $A\\gtrsim 120$, with relative\nabundances close to the Solar r-process abundance distribution. At the same\ntime, our yields show a deficit at lower $A$ compared to the Solar abundances.\nThis is different from what was reported by \\citet{wanajo:14}.  If confirmed,\nour results would suggest that either core-collapse supernovae or late-time\nneutrino, magnetically, and/or viscously driven winds \\citep{dessart:09,\nfernandez:13, siegel:14, metzger:14, fernandez:14, rezzolla:14, ciolfi:14,\nfernandez:15, just:15a, martin:15, kiuchi:15a} would still be needed to produce\nthe least massive of the r-process nuclei.\n\nImportant limitations of the present study are that we restricted ourselves to a\nsingle \\ac{EOS} and to equal mass binaries.
