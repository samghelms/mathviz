In the regime 2$\\times$10$^6 \\lesssim z \\lesssim$ 3$\\times$10$^{5}$, the efficiency of double Compton and Bremsstrahlung processes in controlling the number of CMB photons gradually reduces while photons are still efficiently redistributed in energy by the Compton process. In this case, where thermalization stops being complete, electrons and photons are in kinetic equilibrium with respect to Compton scattering, and any energy injection produces a chemical potential characterized by $\\mu(\\nu)$. At lower redshifts, $z \\lesssim$ 10$^{4}$, up-scattering of photons by electrons also becomes inefficient and photos diffuse only little in energy, creating a $y$-type distortion $y(\\nu)$ which is an early-universe analogue of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.\nBoth types of distortions are tightly constrained by COBE/FIRAS measurements, with upper limits of $|\\mu|$ $<$ 9$\\times$10$^{-5}$ and $|y|$ $<$ 1.5$\\times$10$^{-5}$ at 95\\% confidence \\citep{1996ApJ...473..576F}. \n\n\n\n\nThe amplitude of these signals, predicted within the standard cosmological paradigm, is expected to fall below the bounds set by COBE-FIRAS measurements. The average amplitude of the $y$-parameter, due to the large-scale structure and the reionization epoch, is expected to be $y \\simeq$ 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-6}$, with the most recent computations predicting $y \\simeq$ 2$\\times$10$^{-6}$ \\citep{1994PhRvD..49..648H,2000PhRvD..61l3001R,2003MNRAS.342L..20O,2015arXiv150701583H}. \nThe $\\mu$-distortion signal is expected to be even weaker, with the damping of small-scale acoustic modes giving rise to $\\mu \\simeq$ 2$\\times$10$^{-8}$ in the standard slow-roll inflation scenario \\citep{1991ApJ...371...14D,1994ApJ...430L...5H,2012MNRAS.425.1129C}. Although these distortions are small, significant progress in technology in the last two decades promises to detect these spectral distortions. Experimental concepts, like the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE; \\citealt{2011SPIE.8146E..0TK}) and Polarized Radiation Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (PRISM; \\citealt{2014JCAP...02..006A}), could possibly improve the absolute spectral sensitivity limits of COBE/FIRAS by 2-3 orders of magnitude and detect the aforementioned signals at the 5$\\sigma$ level, providing measurements at sensitivities $\\mu$ = 5$\\times$10$^{-8}$ for a chemical potential distortion and $y$ = 10$^{-8}$ for a Compton distortion \\citep{2002ApJ...581..817F, 2011SPIE.8146E..0TK,2013MNRAS.436.2232C,2014MNRAS.438.2065C}.\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear what the foreground limitations to measuring these primordial spectral distortions will be. When considering the large angular scales of interest to PIXIE, focus has been geared towards the foreground subtraction of polarized emission from the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM) which is dominated by synchrotron radiation from cosmic ray electrons accelerated in the Galactic magnetic field, and thermal emission from dust grains. \\citet{2011JCAP...07..025K} claim that the CMB emission can be distinguished from Galactic foregrounds based on their different frequency spectra, as long as the number of independent frequency channels equals or exceeds the number of free parameters to be derived from a multi-frequency fit. \n\nBut in addition to these Galactic foregrounds, there is another contaminant which has been primarily neglected in the literature, and that is the diffuse background of CO emission lines from external galaxies.  Until recently, \\citet{2008A&A...489..489R} provided the only estimate of this redshift-integrated CO emission signal. Assuming star formation is driven by major mergers, they calculated the resulting star-formation rate (SFR) and then converted it to a CO luminosity, $L_{CO}$, using the measured ratio of $L_{CO}$ to SFR in M82, a low-redshift starburst galaxy. The CO background they found, integrated over all redshifts, is expected to contribute $\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$K at $\\nu \\gtrsim$ 100 GHz with an almost flat spectrum.\n\\citet{2015arXiv151204816D} also include estimates of the background contributed by CO lines from star-forming galaxies when they consider the Galactic and extragalactic foreground intensity compared with the CMB spectra. Using the $L_{\\text{IR}}$-$L_{\\text{CO}}$ relations presented in \\citet{2014ApJ...794..142G} for the CO rotational ladder from $J$ = 1$\\rightarrow$ 0 to $J$ = 5$\\rightarrow$ 4, they find that the CO signal is substantially higher than the PIXIE sensitivity, with the CO(4-3) line alone contributing $\\sim$ 3$\\times$10$^{-24}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at sub-mm wavelengths.\n\n\nIn this paper, we apply the formalism and machinery presented in \\citet{2015JCAP...11..028M} to predict the total CO emission signal generated by a population of star-forming halos with masses $M\\geq$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ from the present-day, to redshifts as early as $z \\sim$ 15. \nOur comprehensive approach is based on large-velocity gradient (LVG) modeling, a radiative transfer modeling technique that produces the full CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) for a specified set of parameters characterizing the emitting source. By linking these parameters to the global properties of the host halos, we calculate the CO line intensities emitted by a halo of mass $M$ at redshift $z$, and then further integrate these CO luminosities over the range of halo masses hosting CO-luminous galaxies to derive the average surface brightness of each rotational line. We find that over a range of frequencies (30-300 GHz) spanned by a PIXIE-like mission, the signal strength of this diffuse background is 1-3 orders of magnitude larger than the spectral distortion limits PIXIE aims to provide. The CO foreground must be removed in order for the more subtle distortion signals from the earlier universe to be detected.\n\nThis Letter is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the formalism and key ingredients of our CO-signal modeling technique. Section 3 presents the results and Section 4 summarizes the main conclusions. We adopt a flat, $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\\Omega_m$ = 0.3, $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ = 0.7, $\\Omega_b$ = 0.045, $H_0$ = 70 km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ (i.e. $h$ = 0.7), $\\sigma_8$ = 0.82, and $n_s$ = 0.95, consistent with the most recent measurements from Planck \\citep{2015arXiv150201589P}.\n\n\\section{The Formalism}\n\nIn \\citet{2015JCAP...11..028M}, we developed a novel approach to estimating the line intensity of any CO rotational transition emitted by a host halo with mass $M$ at redshift $z$ in the early universe, $z \\geq$ 4.

To carry out these computations, we use the Mark \\& Sternberg LVG radiative transfer code described in \\citet{dave}.\n\n We showed previously that the LVG parameters, \\{$T_{\\rm{kin}}$, $n_{\\rm{H_2}}$, $dv/dr$, $\\chi_{\\rm{CO}}$, and $N_{\\rm{H_2}}$\\} , which drive the physics of CO transitions and ultimately dictate both the shape and amplitude of the resulting CO SLED, can be linked to the emitting galaxy's global star formation rate, $SFR$, and the star formation rate surface density, $\\Sigma_{SFR}$. The analytic expressions for these quantities can be found in Section 2.3 of \\citet{2015JCAP...11..028M}, and will not be rederived here. \nThe final ingredient in our model is thus a $SFR-M$ relation that allows us to express these LVG parameters solely as functions of the global properties of the host halo, i.e. the halo mass $M$ and redshift $z$.\n\nFor high redshifts, $z \\geq$ 4, we adopt the average $SFR-M$ relation derived in \\citet{2016MNRAS.455.2101M} via abundance-matching.

This emission is dominated by star-forming halos with masses 10$^{11}$-10$^{12}$ M$_\\odot$, hosting molecular clouds that are characterized by a gas kinetic temperature $T_{\\rm{kin}} \\sim$ 40 K and H$_2$ number densities $n_{\\rm{H_2}} \\sim$ 100 - 1000 cm$^{-3}$.\nThe higher-$J$ ($J >$ 5) CO signal is dominated by emission from 10$^{11}$-10$^{12}$ M$_\\odot$ host halos residing at $z \\gtrsim$ 4; in the star-forming galaxies at these high redshifts, the physical conditions in the emitting molecular clouds are extreme enough to thermalize the higher-order CO transitions, with gas kinetic temperatures of $\\sim$ 60 K and number densities of order 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. \nIntegrating over the population of CO luminous halos between redshifts 0 $\\leq z\\leq$ 15, we find that the total emission (black curve) predicted by our LVG-based model is not completely spectrally smooth, but rather has a prominent bump in the frequency interval $\\sim$ 100 - 200 GHz with a characteristic peak intensity of $\\sim$ 2$\\times$10$^{-23}$ W\\,m$^{-2}$\\,Hz$^{-1}$\\,sr$^{-1}$, i.e. $\\Delta I_\\nu/I_\\nu \\simeq$ (5$\\pm$2)$\\times$10$^{-6}$. \nThis is the frequency range within which the most prominent redshifted CO line emissions, originating from sources at redshifts $z \\sim$ 2 - 5, fall and accumulate to form the peak in the cumulative signal depicted in Figure 1.\nThe total CO intensity is $\\sim$ 0.01\\% of the far-infrared background intensity computed in \\citet{1998ApJ...508..123F} and \\citet{2014ARA&A..52..373L}, where the former computes a total 125-2000 $\\mu$m background of $\\sim$ 14 nW\\,m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$ and the latter computes a total 8-1000 $\\mu$m background of $\\sim$ 27 nW\\,m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$.\nThe uncertainty in our estimates of the CO signal, represented by the shaded regions in Figures 1-3, primarily stems from the uncertainty in the average $SFR-M$ relations we adopt to express the LVG parameters as functions of the global properties of the host halos. \n\n\nIn the case where we assume that local sources of CO emission can be identified and subtracted from observations, we find that the predicted foreground signal not only drops in magnitude as expected, but the shape of the CO spectrum is modified as well. These results are clearly demonstrated in Figure 2, where each curve is computed by integrating the CO intensity emitted by galaxies from some minimum redshift, $z_{\\rm{min}}$, out to redshift $z \\simeq$ 15. Starting off with $z_{\\rm{min}}$ = 0, which corresponds to the original results shown in Figure 1 where emission from local sources is included in the calculations (black curve), we vary the minimum redshift to values as high as $z_{\\rm{min}}$ = 8.  We find that excluding the emission from the population of lower redshift sources results in a sawtooth modulation of the cumulative CO spectrum, with the modulation appearing at the observed frequencies, $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} = \\nu_J/(1+z_{\\rm{min}})$, at which the contribution from a given CO transition, $J \\rightarrow J-1$, drops out. For example, in the case where emission sources at redshifts $z <$ 4 can be subtracted and thus no longer contribute to the CO foreground (blue curve), the total CO signal strength plummets at $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} \\simeq$ 23 GHz when the CO(1-0) line contribution disappears, and then again at $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} \\simeq$ 46 GHz when the CO(2-1) contribution dies out; this pattern continues out to $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} \\simeq$ 922 GHz, at which point the redshifted CO($J$ = 40 $\\rightarrow$ 39) line vanishes and no trace of the CO signal emitted by the galaxy population at $z \\geq$ 4 is left. This sawtooth-shaped form of the resulting CO spectrum highlights both the discrete nature of CO rotational transitions at frequencies, $\\nu_J = J\\nu_{\\rm{CO(1-0)}}$, with $\\nu_{\\rm{CO(1-0)}}$ = 115.3 GHz and $J$ = 1, 2, ..., 40, as well as the significant contribution by modest redshift sources to the overall CO foreground signal. \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace{-.8cm}\\includegraphics[width=105mm,height=80mm]{Fig2.eps}\n\\caption{$\\mu$-type and $y$-type spectral distortions corresponding to the current COBE/FIRAS limits (2$\\sigma$; dotted curves) and the anticipated PIXIE sensitivity limits (5$\\sigma$; dashed curves).

Therefore, although this foreground is expected to peak in the range of frequencies spanned by COBE/FIRAS, the signal has eluded detection to date.

This emission is dominated by star-forming halos with masses 10$^{11}$-10$^{12}$ M$_\\odot$, hosting molecular clouds that are characterized by a gas kinetic temperature $T_{\\rm{kin}} \\sim$ 40 K and H$_2$ number densities $n_{\\rm{H_2}} \\sim$ 100 - 1000 cm$^{-3}$.\nThe higher-$J$ ($J >$ 5) CO signal is dominated by emission from 10$^{11}$-10$^{12}$ M$_\\odot$ host halos residing at $z \\gtrsim$ 4; in the star-forming galaxies at these high redshifts, the physical conditions in the emitting molecular clouds are extreme enough to thermalize the higher-order CO transitions, with gas kinetic temperatures of $\\sim$ 60 K and number densities of order 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$. \nIntegrating over the population of CO luminous halos between redshifts 0 $\\leq z\\leq$ 15, we find that the total emission (black curve) predicted by our LVG-based model is not completely spectrally smooth, but rather has a prominent bump in the frequency interval $\\sim$ 100 - 200 GHz with a characteristic peak intensity of $\\sim$ 2$\\times$10$^{-23}$ W\\,m$^{-2}$\\,Hz$^{-1}$\\,sr$^{-1}$, i.e. $\\Delta I_\\nu/I_\\nu \\simeq$ (5$\\pm$2)$\\times$10$^{-6}$. \nThis is the frequency range within which the most prominent redshifted CO line emissions, originating from sources at redshifts $z \\sim$ 2 - 5, fall and accumulate to form the peak in the cumulative signal depicted in Figure 1.\nThe total CO intensity is $\\sim$ 0.01\\% of the far-infrared background intensity computed in \\citet{1998ApJ...508..123F} and \\citet{2014ARA&A..52..373L}, where the former computes a total 125-2000 $\\mu$m background of $\\sim$ 14 nW\\,m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$ and the latter computes a total 8-1000 $\\mu$m background of $\\sim$ 27 nW\\,m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$.\nThe uncertainty in our estimates of the CO signal, represented by the shaded regions in Figures 1-3, primarily stems from the uncertainty in the average $SFR-M$ relations we adopt to express the LVG parameters as functions of the global properties of the host halos. \n\n\nIn the case where we assume that local sources of CO emission can be identified and subtracted from observations, we find that the predicted foreground signal not only drops in magnitude as expected, but the shape of the CO spectrum is modified as well. These results are clearly demonstrated in Figure 2, where each curve is computed by integrating the CO intensity emitted by galaxies from some minimum redshift, $z_{\\rm{min}}$, out to redshift $z \\simeq$ 15. Starting off with $z_{\\rm{min}}$ = 0, which corresponds to the original results shown in Figure 1 where emission from local sources is included in the calculations (black curve), we vary the minimum redshift to values as high as $z_{\\rm{min}}$ = 8.  We find that excluding the emission from the population of lower redshift sources results in a sawtooth modulation of the cumulative CO spectrum, with the modulation appearing at the observed frequencies, $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} = \\nu_J/(1+z_{\\rm{min}})$, at which the contribution from a given CO transition, $J \\rightarrow J-1$, drops out. For example, in the case where emission sources at redshifts $z <$ 4 can be subtracted and thus no longer contribute to the CO foreground (blue curve), the total CO signal strength plummets at $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} \\simeq$ 23 GHz when the CO(1-0) line contribution disappears, and then again at $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} \\simeq$ 46 GHz when the CO(2-1) contribution dies out; this pattern continues out to $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}} \\simeq$ 922 GHz, at which point the redshifted CO($J$ = 40 $\\rightarrow$ 39) line vanishes and no trace of the CO signal emitted by the galaxy population at $z \\geq$ 4 is left. This sawtooth-shaped form of the resulting CO spectrum highlights both the discrete nature of CO rotational transitions at frequencies, $\\nu_J = J\\nu_{\\rm{CO(1-0)}}$, with $\\nu_{\\rm{CO(1-0)}}$ = 115.3 GHz and $J$ = 1, 2, ..., 40, as well as the significant contribution by modest redshift sources to the overall CO foreground signal. \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\hspace{-.8cm}\\includegraphics[width=105mm,height=80mm]{Fig2.eps}\n\\caption{$\\mu$-type and $y$-type spectral distortions corresponding to the current COBE/FIRAS limits (2$\\sigma$; dotted curves) and the anticipated PIXIE sensitivity limits (5$\\sigma$; dashed curves).

The relative CMB distortion due to this CO foreground is not spectrally smooth, but rather peaks in the frequency range $\\nu \\sim$ 100 - 200 GHz with an amplitude of $\\Delta I_\\nu/I_\\nu \\simeq$ 5$\\times$10$^{-6}$. Exploring cases where nearby sources of CO emission can be identified and subtracted from observations, we find that the dominant contributors to the CO signal originate from star-forming halos with masses $M \\sim$ 10$^{11}$-10$^{12}$ M$_\\odot$ at modest redshifts of $z \\sim$ 2 - 5. \nWhile the intensity of this cumulative CO foreground is at least 2-100 times weaker than the current COBE/FIRAS upper limits, and has thus far evaded detection, it falls well above the detection limit of future instruments, such as PIXIE, which promise to measure CMB spectral distortions with sensitivity improved by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to COBE/FIRAS. \n\nIn standard cosmology, there are a number of different heating/cooling processes in the early Universe which may have given rise to CMB spectral distortions of varying magnitudes and shapes. \nSilk damping of small-scale perturbations in the primordial baryon-electron-photon fluid is one of them, resulting in CMB distortions with magnitudes of $\\Delta I_\\nu/I_\\nu \\simeq$ 10$^{-8}$ - 10$^{-10}$, depending on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power spectrum at scales 50 $\\leq k \\leq$ 10$^4$ Mpc$^{-1}$\\citep{1991ApJ...371...14D,1994ApJ...430L...5H,2012MNRAS.425.1129C}. \nResidual annihilation of dark matter particles throughout the history of the Universe is another, releasing energy that leads to $\\mu$ and $y$ distortions of amplitude $\\mu \\approx$ 3$\\times$10$^{-9}$ ($z >$ 5$\\times$10$^4$) and $y \\approx$ 5$\\times$10$^{-10}$ ($z <$ 5$\\times$10$^4$), respectively \\citep{2012MNRAS.419.1294C,2014MNRAS.438.2065C}. The cosmological recombination of hydrogen and helium is expected to have introduced distortions as well, with amplitudes of $\\Delta I_\\nu/I_\\nu \\simeq$ 10$^{-9}$ at redshifts $z \\sim$ 1100 - 6000 \\citep{2006A&A...458L..29C,2006MNRAS.371.1939R,2008A&A...485..377R}. \nSimilar magnitude but opposite sign distortions, $\\mu \\sim$ -2.7$\\times$10$^{-9}$ and $y \\sim$ -6$\\times$10$^{-10}$, are expected from energy losses of the CMB to baryons and electrons as they cool adiabiatically faster than radiation with the expansion of the Universe \\citep{ChlubaPhD,2012MNRAS.419.1294C,2012A&A...540A.124K}.\n\nExperiments like PIXIE will be able to constrain these spectral distortions in the CMB at the 5$\\sigma$ level, providing measurements at sensitivities $\\mu$ = 5$\\times$10$^{-8}$ and $y$ = 10$^{-8}$. However, as demonstrated above, the cumulative CO foreground is an important contaminant to these cosmological distortions, with a signal strength, $\\Delta I_\\nu^{\\rm{CO}}/I_\\nu \\sim$ 5$\\times$10$^{-6}$- 10$^{-7}$, that is 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than PIXIE's sensitivity limits in the frequency range $\\nu \\sim$ 20 - 360 GHz.\nBased on the results depicted in Figure 2, CO luminous sources at redshifts $z <$ 8 need to be identified and subtracted in order to reduce this cumulative signal to levels that are at least comparable to the $\\mu$- and $y$-type spectral distortions one hopes to constrain. Removing all such sources is challenging, both in terms of exposure time and in terms of field coverage. Even with ten hours of integration time, instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will miss CO emission from host halos with masses $M \\lesssim$ 5$\\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, which contribute tens of percent of the cumulative CO signal at redshifts $z \\gtrsim$ 4. (In this paper, we integrate over the population of CO luminous halos with masses $M \\geq$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ and thus present conservative estimates of the total CO foreground which do not account for contributions from lower mass halos, $M \\lesssim$ 10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$.) \nRemoving the aggregate line emission from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history poses its own difficulties.\nUnlike the spectrally smooth synchrotron and thermal dust foregrounds which can be approximately described by power laws, the CO foreground fluctuates in frequency due to the clustering of sources over restricted regions on the sky; accurate foreground subtraction therefore requires knowledge of the emission spectrum to high order of precision, challenging our ability to fully exploit PIXIE's sensitivity to constrain CMB spectral measurements.\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nThis research was also supported by the Raymond and Beverly Sackler Tel Aviv University - Harvard/ITC Astronomy Program.
