In the following, we will first explain the experimental setup and measurements, then we will give the results of our measurements and show how well they fit the expected relationship.\n\n\\section{Experimental Setup}\nEMMA is an accelerator to demonstrate and study in detail the properties of a linear non-scaling FFAG. Its lattice consists of 42 identical doublet cells with focusing and defocusing quadrupole magnets. A beam traverses the quadrupoles off-axis by design and obtains a net bending. It was designed to accelerate a single bunch of 10.5~MeV/$c$ electrons to 20.5~MeV/$c$ through the serpentine channel~\\cite{Berg2001,Johnstone2003}. The circumference is about 16.5~m and the orbital period is about 55.3~ns. Although the horizontal orbit does not stay constant during acceleration because of the fixed field lattice magnets, the dispersion function had been minimized and the normalized physical acceptance should be at least 3000~$\\pi$\\,mm\\,mrad in both horizontal and vertical direction within a vacuum chamber whose diameter is about 40~mm.\n\n\\subsection{Measurement of Orbital Period}\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{fig1}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{The raw BPM signal (dots) and a function of the form $f(x)=(c_0+c_1x)\\exp[-x^2/(2\\sigma^2)]$ fit to that signal (dashed line).}\n  \\label{fig:1}\n\\end{figure}\nThe orbital period is about 55.3~ns, while the shift due to amplitude dependence is the order of ps. The arrival time of the bunch for each pass was obtained by fitting a measured beam position monitor (BPM) signal, which is a filtered differential of the bunch current, recorded on a 40~GS/s oscilloscope, to a function of the form $f(x)=(c_0+c_1x)\\exp[-x^2/(2\\sigma^2)]$ and determining the zero crossing, which was used as the arrival time, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:1}. The orbital period was then obtained to high precision by averaging over a number of turns. When we began studying EMMA, we used the internal clock of the oscilloscope as a reference time, but this proved problematic since the oscilloscope appeared to occasionally drop a sample, resulting in orbital period fluctuations corresponding to the oscilloscope sample period. Instead, we simultaneously recorded a high precision 1.3~GHz reference waveform used for timing the entire facility, and performed our timing measurements by finding the phase of the BPM signal with respect to that reference waveform.\n\n\\subsection{Measurement of Tunes and Computation of Chromaticity}\nAll the momentum dependent parameters in EMMA were measured not by changing the beam momentum, but by equivalently changing the excitation current of the lattice magnets, while keeping the beam momentum fixed at 12.5~MeV/$c$. The dynamics of a beam with a momentum of $p$ with magnet currents at their reference values for 12.5~MeV/$c$ are identical to the dynamics of a 12.5~MeV/$c$ beam with the magnets' currents scaled by a factor of 12.5/$p$, with the exception of a change in the particle velocity. We refer to this lattice as having an ``equivalent momentum'' of $p$~MeV/$c$.\n\n\\begin{table}[!tbp]\n  \\caption{\\label{tab:4}Measured vertical cell tunes and their uncertainties computed using a discrete Fourier transform of 10 turns of data.

Since all the cells are designed to be identical, we defined the cell tune to be the betatron phase advance through each cell divided by $2\\pi$ (the tune for a full turn is obtained by multiplying this number by 42). We performed a discrete Fourier transform of the BPM data for 10 turns (420 cells) and chose the maximum amplitude from that to be the cell tune, the resulting values for which are given in Table~\\ref{tab:4}. To determine the chromaticity per cell at the equivalent momentum $p_0= 17.6\\text{ MeV}/c$, we first make a weighted least-squares fit of the cosines of $2\\pi$ times the cell tunes to a polynomial in the inverse of the equivalent momentum. The chromaticity per cell at $p_0$ can then be determined evaluating the polynomial and its derivative at $1/p_0$, applying the appropriate derivative composition formulas to find the derivative of the tune with respect to momentum, then multiplying the result by $p_0$. Linear error propagation then gives the uncertainty in the chromaticity. The momenta, tunes, and the uncertainties in the vertical tunes are given in Table~\\ref{tab:4}. Horizontally, the best fit is with a cubic polynomial, resulting in a chromaticity per cell of $-0.158\\pm0.014$, with a chi-squared per degree of freedom of 0.7. Vertically, the best fit is with a quadratic polynomial, resulting in a chromaticity per cell of $-0.204\\pm0.006$, with a chi-squared per degree of freedom of 1.5. To obtain chromaticities per turn, multiply the chromaticity per cell by 42.\n\n\\subsection{Measurement of Betatron Amplitude}\nIn order to set the betatron oscillation amplitude in the vertical direction, we varied the deflection angle at a vertical orbit corrector in the injection beam line. The transverse beam emittance from the pre-accelerator is small compared with the acceptance of EMMA so that the whole bunch oscillates coherently as a single particle until tune spread gradually damps the coherent signal.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{fig2}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{Measured beam position signal over a number of turns, showing the reduction of signal amplitude due to tune spread arising from chromaticity and energy spread in the beam.}\n  \\label{fig:2}\n\\end{figure}\nThis tune spread arises because EMMA was designed to eliminate nonlinearity as much as possible to ensure a large dynamic aperture. The natural chromaticity remains and induces tune spread as a result of the finite momentum spread. For example, a momentum spread of 0.2\\% leads to a tune spread of roughly $2\\times10^{-2}$ per turn. A point-like beam injected off axis in the transverse phase space ends up as a ring in phase space within 25 turns. Since the BPM detects only the charge center of particles, measured betatron oscillations appear to damp in the same time scale, as can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:2}.\n\nWe measured beam positions at monitors located at both ends of three different straight sections in EMMA. The beam position monitors were far enough from the adjacent quadrupole magnets that the intervening straight could be treated as a drift; thus we could infer position and angle of the beam orbit in phase space at the center of the drift from the beam position data at the two ends of each straight. Were it not for the decoherence of the BPM signal due to energy spread in the beam and the nonzero chromaticity, these data could be used to directly reconstruct the action value.\n\nTo compute the action in the presence of the chromaticity-driven decoherence, a somewhat more involved procedure is required, which is outlined here and described in more detail in~\\cite{Edmonds2014}.

The variation is negligible in ordinary particle accelerators with relatively small beam emittance. In an accelerator for large emittance beams like muons and unstable nuclei, however, this effect cannot be ignored. We measured orbital period in a linear non-scaling fixed-field alternating-gradient (FFAG) accelerator, which is a candidate for muon acceleration, and compared with the theoretical prediction. The good agreement between them gives important ground for the design of particle accelerators for a new generation of particle and nuclear physics experiments.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n\\thispagestyle{headings}\n\\section{Introduction}\nA linear non-scaling Fixed-Field Alternating-Gradient (FFAG) accelerator~\\cite{Symon1956,Kolomensky1966,Johnstone1999} was proposed to accelerate muon beams for a neutrino factory~\\cite{Machida2003,Apollonio2009}. The fixed field nature makes very rapid acceleration possible so that short-lived particles such as muons can be accelerated. FFAG accelerators also have large acceptance, which is another essential requirement for acceleration of muons whose normalized emittance is a few 10,000 $\\pi$ mm mrad even after ionization cooling. In addition, a proposed experiment for the search of charged lepton flavor violation called PRISM (Phase Rotated Intense Slow Muon source) utilizes a FFAG ring to convert a short bunch of muons with large momentum spread to a monochromatic long bunch~\\cite{Kuno2000}. Although the FFAG of PRISM is a storage ring rather than an accelerator, large acceptance is one of the key ingredients of that experiment.\n\nThis paper describes the measurement of the time of flight in a linear non-scaling FFAG as a function of transverse amplitude. That the time of flight depends on transverse amplitude, and to lowest order the time of flight dependence is quadratic in the transverse phase space variables, is an obvious result of orbit geometry for a straight beamline. One of the first places it was identified as an important effect was in particle sources~\\cite{Helm1968}, due to the large angular acceptances possible in a source that captures with solenoid focusing (see~\\cite{Sayed2014} for the importance of the same effect in a high-intensity muon source). When using a small momentum compaction to get short bunches in an electron storage ring, this effect can be significant with respect to the energy-dependent time of flight, and thus can have an impact on longitudinal dynamics~\\cite{Bruck1973,Deacon1980,Deacon1981,Emery1993}. In free electron lasers, this effect can cause particles with higher transverse amplitudes to lose synchronism with the coherent bunch structure~\\cite{Deacon1980,Deacon1981,Artamonov1989}. Ionization cooling channels for muons also require very large angular acceptances; the dependence of the time of flight on transverse amplitude requires an introduction of a correlation between beam energy and transverse amplitude to avoid unwanted longitudinal emittance growth~\\cite{Lebrun1998,Fernow1999,Ankenbrandt1999}. Finally, and of particular interest for this work, this phenomenon is important for non-scaling FFAGs, which typically operate on both sides of the time of flight minimum, and for some important applications, particularly muon acceleration, accelerate beams with large transverse emittances~\\cite{Machida2006,Berg2007}.\n\nTo achieve extremely large transverse acceptances, a linear non-scaling FFAG relies on the exclusive use of linear magnets. The chromaticity of the machine is thus the uncorrected natural chromaticity. Introduction of sextupoles to correct the chromaticity results in a significant reduction in the transverse acceptance~\\cite{Berg2010}.\n\nThere is a simple relationship between this time of flight dependence on the transverse amplitude and the chromaticity, given by\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta t = -\\dfrac{2\\pi}{c}(\\xi_hJ_h+\\xi_vJ_v),\n  \\label{eq:1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta t=-\\dfrac{2\\pi}{c}(\\xi_{h}J_{h}+\\xi_{v}J_{v}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\dfrac</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mi>h</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>J</mi><mi>h</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03be</mi><mi>v</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>J</mi><mi>v</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02901.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $y_n$ and $p_{y,n}$ are respectively the transverse position and momentum of the bunch centroid at the observation point on the $n^{\\text{th}}$ turn.

For example, a momentum spread of 0.2\\% leads to a tune spread of roughly $2\\times10^{-2}$ per turn. A point-like beam injected off axis in the transverse phase space ends up as a ring in phase space within 25 turns. Since the BPM detects only the charge center of particles, measured betatron oscillations appear to damp in the same time scale, as can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:2}.\n\nWe measured beam positions at monitors located at both ends of three different straight sections in EMMA. The beam position monitors were far enough from the adjacent quadrupole magnets that the intervening straight could be treated as a drift; thus we could infer position and angle of the beam orbit in phase space at the center of the drift from the beam position data at the two ends of each straight. Were it not for the decoherence of the BPM signal due to energy spread in the beam and the nonzero chromaticity, these data could be used to directly reconstruct the action value.\n\nTo compute the action in the presence of the chromaticity-driven decoherence, a somewhat more involved procedure is required, which is outlined here and described in more detail in~\\cite{Edmonds2014}.

The line is a linear fit to the data.}\n  \\label{fig:3}\n\\end{figure}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:3} shows the measured orbital period as a function of vertical betatron oscillation amplitudes at the equivalent momentum of 17.6~MeV/$c$. In performing the measurement, we first set our injection magnets to minimize the betatron oscillation amplitude in the ring for both the horizontal and vertical planes. Then we applied 15 different settings for the vertical corrector in the injection line to create vertical betatron oscillations in the ring of varying amplitudes. The corrector currents were applied in a random order to reduce any effects of secular drifts in machine parameters, such as beam energy. \n\nFor each vertical corrector setting, we performed 50 measurements of the vertical action $J_v$, using the average for the result and the standard deviation in the average for the uncertainty. For each setting of the vertical orbit corrector, the initial amplitude was measured at three locations in the ring. Corrector settings resulting in the smallest amplitudes are omitted because we could not obtain accurate action values for them.\n\nThe time of flight for each setting was obtained by averaging the time of flight for the first 50 turns, then taking the average over 20 injections. The uncertainty is computed as the standard deviation of the latter average, and is at or below 0.1~ps for every setting.\n\nTo assess the agreement between our data and the predicted chromaticity, we perform a linear fit to the orbital period and action data. We first assign a single action value and uncertainty for each vertical corrector setting, since the measurements at the three different ring positions cannot be treated as uncorrelated for the purposes of the linear fit. We then perform the linear fit to the resulting points, but must address larger-than-expected fluctuations in the data as described below.\n\nTo compute the value for the action for a particular corrector setting, we first compute the uncertainty-weighted average. For some settings, the chi-squared per degree of freedom in that average is large, indicating systematic effects that were not accounted for. To avoid overweighting settings where that was the case, the uncertainty assigned is a weighted average of the uncertainty computed through error propagation and the uncertainty from the weighted average, with the weighting factor being the chi-squared distribution function. \n\nWhen we perform a weighted least-squares linear fit to the resulting points, the result of which is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:3}, we find a chi-squared per degree of freedom of 9, indicating either unaccounted-for uncertainties or that the linear model is poor. Qualitatively, the figure indicates that the linear model is a good representation of the data. To account for the excessive uncertainties, we increase the underlying uncertainties by a factor of the square root of the chi-squared per degree of freedom. The resulting slope is $0.201\\pm0.017$~ps/$\\mu$m, which from Eq.~(\\ref{eq:1}), would correspond to a chromaticity per cell of $-0.229\\pm0.019$. This is consistent with the chromaticity per cell of $-0.204\\pm0.006$ predicted from the tune measurements as discussed above.\n\nIn summary, for several betatron amplitudes, we have made direct measurements of the time of flight and the betatron amplitude. Using measured tune values to compute the chromaticity, we have shown that Eq.~(\\ref{eq:1}) is consistent with our experimental results, though unaccounted-for measurement uncertainties complicate the analysis. This effect, the time of flight dependence on transverse amplitude, is of great importance~\\cite{Machida2006,Berg2007} for proposed accelerators requiring large transverse amplitudes, such as muon accelerators~\\cite{Lebrun1998,Fernow1999,Ankenbrandt1999,Machida2003,Apollonio2009,Sayed2014}, where chromaticities are generally large, as well as for PRISM~\\cite{Kuno2000}, should its chromaticity be imperfectly corrected or a non-scaling FFAG option be considered. The large transverse acceptance of the non-scaling FFAG EMMA~\\cite{Barlow2010,Machida2012} enabled this direct measurement to be made straightforwardly.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nThe work is supported by the BASROC/CONFORM project under the EPSRC grant No. EP/E032869, the US Department of Energy under contract Nos.
