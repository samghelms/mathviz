[{"file": "1601.07637.tex", "nexttext": "\nHere $i,j=1,2,\\ldots,90$ and $i\\neq j$ (note that $A_{ii}=0$ because \nwe do not consider self-connections of nodes, i.e., self-interactions \nof genes). Consequently, there are biological regulatory \nrelationships between genes $i$ and $j$ when $A_{ij}=1$. In such a \nway, we have constructed the pathway-based network of \nhypertension-related genes, which contains $90$ nodes (genes) and \n$482$ edges (connections), as shown in Fig.~\\ref{gene network}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.5cm]{Fig1.eps}\n\n\\caption{Illustration of the pathway-based gene network of \nhypertension for the SS rat with all $90$ nodes and $482$ edges. \nThe large red nodes represent the seven hub genes. \n(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, \nthe reader is referred to the web version of this article.)}\n\\label{gene network}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Statistical and topological characteristics of the gene network}\n\\label{sec:3}\n\nIn this section, we analyze the pathway-based gene network of \nhypertension by calculating the following indices: degree (and \naverage degree), degree distribution, average path length, \nclustering coefficient, assortativity coefficient, and four \ncentrality indices (degree centrality, betweenness centrality, \ncloseness centrality and integrated centrality), which can provide \nus with statistical and topological characteristics of the gene \nnetwork.\n\n\\subsection{Degree and degree distribution}\n\\label{subsec:3.1}\n\nThe degree $k_{i}$ of a node $i$ is the number of edges connecting \nto the node. The average of $k_{i}$ over all nodes is called the \naverage degree of the network, and is denoted as \n$\\langle k\\rangle =\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{{N}} k_{i}$. \nThe degree distribution function $P(k)$ gives the probability that a \nrandomly selected node has exactly $k$ edges~\\cite{S2001n,N2003sr}. \nThe degree distribution is one of the most basic quantitative \nproperties of a network.\n\nFor the pathway-based gene network of hypertension, the degree \n$k_{i}$ of a node $i$ is just the number of other genes which are \ninvolved in the same pathway(s) as gene $i$. \nFig.~\\ref{degree and distribution} plots the degree and degree \ndistribution of the gene network. Here, the values of the degree of \n$90$ nodes are ranked in a descending order (with $n_{g}(k)$ \ndenoting the rank of genes in degree values), and it is found that \nthe gene {\\it Jun} of $n_{g}=1$ has the highest degree $30$. The average \ndegree $\\langle k \\rangle$ of this network is about $10.71$. The \nillustration of degree distribution shows that the probability that \na gene can link with $k$ other genes does not decay as a power-law, \nsuggesting that the gene network does not have a scale-free topology.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\\linewidth}\n\\centering\\hspace{0.0cm}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8.05cm]{Fig2_left.eps}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\\linewidth}\n\\centering\\hspace{-0.45cm}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=8.03cm]{Fig2_right.eps}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{Degree and degree distribution of the pathway-based gene \nnetwork: (left) The values of the degree of $90$ nodes are shown in \ndescending order; (right) The degree distribution is not scale-free.}\n\\label{degree and distribution}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Average path length and clustering coefficient}\n\\label{subsec:3.2}\n\nIn a network, a path from node $i$ to node $j$ is a sequence of \nadjacent nodes starting at $i$ and ending at $j$. The path with the \nsmallest number of edges between the two selected nodes is called the \nshortest path. The distance $d_{ij}$ between two nodes $i$ and $j$ \nis defined as the number of edges along the shortest path connecting \nthem. The diameter $D$ is the maximum distance between any pair of \nnodes in the network, i.e., $D=\\max\\{d_{ij}\\}$. The average path \nlength $L$ is defined as the mean distance between two nodes, \naveraged over all pairs of nodes, i.e. \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nL=\\frac{1}{N(N-1)}\\sum_{i\\neq j} d_{ij},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhich offers a measure of the overall navigability of a \nnetwork~\\cite{X2003tag}.\n\nA clustering coefficient can be used to describe the cohesiveness of \nthe neighborhood of a node~\\cite{WS1998n,N2003sr}. In a network, the \nclustering coefficient $c_{i}$ is defined as the ratio between the \nnumber $e_{i}$ of edges that actually link the $k_{i}$ neighbors of \nnode $i$ to each other and the total possible number of edges among \nthem, i.e. \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nc_{i}=\\frac{2e_{i}}{k_{i}(k_{i}-1)} & (k_{i}\\geqslant 2).\n\\label{clustering coef}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe clustering coefficient $C$ of the whole network is the average \nof $c_{i}$ over all $i$, $C=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{{N}} c_{i}$, \nwhich characterizes the overall tendency of nodes to form clusters, \nclearly, $C\\leqslant 1$.\n\nThe pathway-based gene network has a very short average path length: \n$L$ is about $2.331$, and $\\log(\\log N)<L<\\log N$. The diameter $D$ \nis only $5$ (i.e., the distance between genes {\\it Gcgr} and \n{\\it Gnpat}), which implies at most five hops separate any two genes \nin the $482$ connections of the network. The clustering coefficient \nis calculated to be $C=0.6403$, which is relatively high. Therefore, \nthe pathway-based gene network has the small-world property (short \n$L$ and high $C$).\n\n\\subsection{Assortativity}\n\\label{subsec:3.3}\n\nThe concept of assortativity is introduced to describe degree \ncorrelations between neighboring nodes in a network~\\cite{N2002prl}. \nA network is assortative if high (low) degree nodes tend to be \nconnected to other high (low) degree nodes; otherwise, it is \ndisassortative if high (low) degree nodes tend to be connected to \nother low (high) degree nodes. The assortativity can be described by \nthe correlation between the degrees of neighboring nodes in terms of \nthe mean Pearson correlation coefficient. Let $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ \nbe the degrees of the end nodes of the $i$th edge, with \n$i=1,2,\\ldots,E$ ($E$ is the number of edges in the network), then \nthe assortativity coefficient of the network is given \nby~\\cite{N2002prl}: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr=\\frac{E^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i}x_{i}y_{i}\n  -\\left[E^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i}\\frac{1}{2}(x_{i}+y_{i})\\right]^{2}}\n  {E^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i}\\frac{1}{2}(x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2})\n  -\\left[E^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i}\\frac{1}{2}(x_{i}+y_{i})\\right]^{2}}.\n\\label{assortativity coef}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe network is assortative if $r>0$, and disassortative if $r<0$. \nThe assortativity coefficient of the pathway-based gene network is \ncalculated to be $r=0.2178$, exhibiting an assortative behavior. This \nis different from most biological networks which show negative $r$.\n\n\\subsection{Centrality}\n\\label{subsec:3.4}\n\n\\subsubsection{Definitions of four centrality indices}\n\\label{subsubsec:3.4.1}\n\nThe degree centrality $C_{d}$, betweenness centrality $C_{b}$ and \ncloseness centrality $C_{c}$ are three centrality indices commonly \nused in finding out the centralization nodes of the \nnetwork~\\cite{B1965bs,F1979sn}. Recently, we also introduced an \nintegrated centrality $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}$ to fully reflect the \ncontribution of three centrality indices \n$\\{C_{d},C_{b},C_{c}\\}$~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}.\n\nThe degree centrality of a given node $i$ is the proportion of other \nnodes that are adjacent to node $i$~\\cite{F1979sn}, i.e. \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nC_{d}(i)=\\frac{k_{i}}{N-1},\n\\label{degree centrality}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nhere $N-1$ is the maximum possible degree of the network.\n\nThe betweenness centrality of a node $i$ is defined as the proportion \nof all shortest paths (geodesics) between pairs of other nodes that \ninclude this node $i$~\\cite{F1979sn}: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nC_{b}(i)=\\sum_{j(<k)}^{N}\\sum_{k}^{N}\\frac{g_{jk}(i)}{g_{jk}},\n\\label{betweenness}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $g_{jk}$ is the number of shortest paths between nodes $j$ and \n$k$, and $g_{jk}(i)$ the number of shortest paths containing node \n$i$ between nodes $j$ and $k$.\n\nThe closeness centrality of a node $i$ is the number of other nodes \ndivided by the sum of the distances between node $i$ and all \nothers~\\cite{B1965bs,F1979sn}: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nC_{c}(i)=(L_{i})^{-1}=\\frac{N-1}{\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N}d_{ij}},\n\\label{closeness}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nhere $L_{i}$ is the average distance between node $i$ and all other \nnodes.\n\nTo comprehensively and quantitatively reflect the contribution of the \nabove three centrality indices $\\{C_{d},C_{b},C_{c}\\}$, we can also \nintroduce the integrated centrality $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}$ of node $i$, \ndefined as follows~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nC_{\\mathrm{intgr}}(i)=\\frac{1}{3}\\left[\\frac{C_{d}(i)}{C_{d,\\max}}+\n\\frac{C_{b}(i)}{C_{b,\\max}}+\\frac{C_{c}(i)}{C_{c,\\max}}\\right],\n\\label{intgr.centrality}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $C_{d,\\max}$, $C_{b,\\max}$ and $C_{c,\\max}$ are the maximums \nof $\\{C_{d}\\}$, $\\{C_{b}\\}$ and $\\{C_{c}\\}$, respectively. \nObviously, $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}(i)$ has a value between $0$ and $1$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Centrality analysis and hub genes}\n\\label{subsubsec:3.4.2}\n\nFor the pathway-based gene network of hypertension, the four \ncentrality indices are calculated based on the above definitions, \nand the top $25$ values of each centrality index are listed in \nTable~\\ref{centrality data}. In the following, we will determine hub \ngenes in the network through centrality analysis.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\scriptsize\n\\caption{Top $25$ values of degree centrality $C_{d}$, betweenness \ncentrality $C_{b}$, closeness centrality $C_{c}$ and integrated \ncentrality $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}$ in the pathway-based gene network of \nhypertension.

We \ncan see in Fig.~\\ref{CdCc and CbCc} that $C_{c}$ of most of the \nnodes is distributed in the range of $(0.25,0.51)$. In this range of \n$C_{c}$, we also observe that in Fig.~\\ref{CdCc and CbCc} (left) \nthe distribution of $C_{d}$ is roughly uniform in the range of \n$(0.01,0.34)$; while in Fig.~\\ref{CdCc and CbCc} (right) $C_{b}$ \nis non-uniformly distributed in the range of $[0,0.094)$, here \nmost of the nodes have very small $C_{b}$, and only a few nodes \nhave large $C_{b}$ which also have relatively large $C_{c}$. \nFig.~\\ref{3D-CdCbCc} combines the three centrality indices \n$\\{C_{d},C_{b},C_{c}\\}$ in the three-dimensional space. It can be \nseen from Fig.~\\ref{3D-CdCbCc} that a small number of nodes have \nhigh values of three centrality indices, which can be viewed as hubs \nof the network. Generally speaking, each of these three centrality \nindices has its own focus on an influence of a node on other nodes \nin the network, thus one can identify hubs according to that focus. \nHowever, in order to fully reflect the contribution of all these \nthree centrality indices, we will simply determine key hub genes \nusing integrated centrality $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}$, as in \nRef.~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=15.1cm]{Fig3.eps}\n\n\\caption{Correspondence among degree centrality $C_{d}$, betweenness \ncentrality $C_{b}$ and closeness centrality $C_{c}$ of nodes in the \npathway-based gene network: (left) $C_{d}$ versus $C_{c}$; \n(right) $C_{b}$ versus $C_{c}$.

From \nTable~\\ref{centrality data} and Fig.~\\ref{Cintgr.vs.ng}, seven nodes \nare determined as important hub genes: \n{\\it Jun}, {\\it Rps6kb1}, {\\it Cycs}, {\\it Creb3l2}, {\\it Cdk4}, \n{\\it Actg1} and {\\it RT1-Da}. \nThese seven genes have the integrated centrality of \n$C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}>0.71$, which is about $77\\%$ of its maximum \n($0.9280$).

Here, we also \nprovide a brief biological description of the first hub gene. The \ngene {\\it Jun} is ranked first in $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}$ because it has the \nhighest $C_{d}$ and $C_{c}$, as well as the second highest $C_{b}$. \n{\\it Jun} encodes a protein that exhibits double-stranded DNA binding, \ninvolved in aging, angiogenesis, endothelin and Rho/Rac/Cdc42 \nmediated signaling pathways. It is associated with kidney neoplasms \nand spinal cord injuries. Recent studies have confirmed that {\\it Jun} is \nclosely related to low potassium reaction and cell renal cell \ncarcinoma. A low potassium diet might induce hypertension, which is \nalways accompanied by hypokalemia. The incidence of renal cell \ncarcinoma coupled with hypertension is up to \n$14\\%$--$40\\%$~\\cite{KKSS2012jccr}.\n\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\n\\caption{Biological descriptions of seven hub genes in the \npathway-based gene network.}\n\\label{hubs descriptions}\n\n\\centering\n\n\\scriptsize\n\n\\begin{tabular*}{{1\\textwidth}}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lp{5.2cm}lp{6.3cm}}\n\\hline\nGene    & Official full name & Gene ID         & Description\\\\\n\\hline \n{\\it Jun}     & jun proto-oncogene & {\\;\\,}24{\\,}516 & \nEncodes a protein that exhibits double-stranded DNA binding\\\\\n{\\it Rps6kb1} & ribosomal protein S6 kinase, polypeptide 1 & {\\;\\,}83{\\,}840 & \nEncodes a protein that exhibits ATP binding; peptide binding\\\\\n{\\it Cycs}    & cytochrome c, somatic & {\\;\\,}25{\\,}309 & \nEncodes a protein that exhibits electron carrier activity\\\\\n{\\it Creb3l2} & cAMP responsive element binding protein 3-like 2 & 362{\\,}339 & \nEncodes a protein that exhibits cAMP response element binding\\\\\n{\\it Cdk4}    & cyclin-dependent kinase 4 & {\\;\\,}94{\\,}201 & \nRelated to circadian rhythm; organ regeneration\\\\\n{\\it Actg1}   & actin, gamma 1 & 287{\\,}876 & \nInvolved in response to calcium ion\\\\\n{\\it RT1-Da}  & RT1 class \\Rmnum{2}, locus Da & 294{\\,}269 & \nInvolved in antigen processing\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular*}\n\n\n\\end{table}\n\nAmong the seven hub genes, we note that the gene {\\it Cdk4} is the \nonly common hub gene in both the pathway-based gene network here and \nthe gene co-expression network of our previous \nstudy~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}. Besides {\\it Cdk4}, we also see in \nTable~\\ref{centrality data} that the three genes \n{\\it Shc1}, {\\it Fzd2} and {\\it Col4a1}, which have relatively high \nintegrated centrality $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}>0.60$, are the hub genes \nidentified in the gene co-expression network of \nRef.~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}. These four genes have been confirmed by \nbiological and medical research to play important roles in \nhypertension. Moreover, we also observe that although the gene \n{\\it Sdhb} is ranked only joint 17th in $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}$ \n($=0.5678$), it has the highest betweenness centrality $C_{b}$. Since \n$C_{b}$ is based on the shortest paths and reflects the ability of a \nnode to influence other related nodes in the network, {\\it Sdhb} \nshould also be a key gene in hypertension. If we lower the threshold \nof integrated centrality to $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}>0.50$, then these four \ngenes ({\\it Shc1}, {\\it Fzd2}, {\\it Col4a1} and {\\it Sdhb}) can also \nbe included in hub genes. In this paper, we do not take this lower \nthreshold of $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}>0.50$ because, in view of the \nrelatively large range of variation of $C_{b}$, we do not want the \ngenes of small $C_{b}$ to be included in hub genes. In a wider view, \nhowever, these four genes ({\\it Shc1}, {\\it Fzd2}, {\\it Col4a1} and \n{\\it Sdhb}), together with the above seven hub genes, are worthy of \nfurther study in the future.\n\n\n\\section{Modular structure of the gene network}\n\\label{sec:4}\n\nMany networks are found to divide naturally into modules or \ncommunities, i.e., groups of nodes within which the connections are \nrelatively dense but between which they are \nsparser~\\cite{GN2002pnas,N2006pnas}. In this section, we explore the \nmodular structure of the pathway-based gene network of hypertension.\n\n\\subsection{Structural equivalence of nodes}\n\\label{subsec:4.1}\n\nTwo nodes are structural equivalent if they have identical \nconnections with all other nodes. We can use a dissimilarity index \n$d_{s}$ to measure the equivalence of two nodes $i$ and $j$ as \nfollows~\\cite{dNMB2005esnap}: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nd_{s}(i,j)=\\frac{|V(i)+V(j)|}{k_{1}+k_{2}}.\n\\label{dissimilarity index}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $i,j=1,2,\\ldots,90$, $V(i)$ are all neighbors of node \n$i$, $|\\cdot |$ stands for set cardinality, $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ \nstand for the largest and the second largest degree in the network, \nrespectively. Obviously, $d_{s}(i,j)$ has a value between $0$ \n(completely similar) and $1$ (completely different). In \nTable~\\ref{dissimilarity scores} we list the dissimilarity scores of ten \ngenes distributed in different modules (cf. Fig.~\\ref{modules}).\n\n\\begin{table}[!tbp]\n\\caption{Dissimilarity scores $d_{s}(i,j)$ of ten nodes (genes) in \nthe pathway-based gene network.

Having examined \nthe number of pathways in which each gene is involved, we find that \nthere are nine genes involved in more than 10 pathways: \n{\\it Jun} ($30$), {\\it RT1-Da} ($21$), {\\it Cdk4} ($17$), \n{\\it Cycs} ($17$), {\\it Creb3l2} ($16$), {\\it Actg1} ($15$), \n{\\it Pdgfra} ($14$), {\\it Tgfbr1} ($14$) and {\\it Shc1} ($13$), \nhere the number of pathways involved is shown in parentheses. These \nnine genes (red nodes in Fig.~\\ref{modules}) are a basis of dense \nconnections within the largest module \\Rmnum{1}. We also note that \namong these nine genes, there are six hub genes (large nodes marked \nred); another hub gene {\\it Rps6kb1} (large node marked green) is \ninvolved in nine pathways.\n\nWe can examine the robustness of the network based on modular \nstructure~\\cite{N2006pnas,CNSW2000prl}. The nodes within a module \n(except \\Rmnum{4} and \\Rmnum{5} in this paper) are relatively robust \nagainst mutation because there are multiple paths between any two \nnodes and thus the network will not be easily broken when mutation \noccurs. Nevertheless, the parts of fewer connections between modules \nshould be the weaknesses of the network system. Fig.~\\ref{modules} \nvisualizes the weak links of the network. The removal of these weak \nconnections and relevant nodes would result in the breaking of the \nnetwork. Thus, the modular structure analysis can facilitate the \nexploration of the relationship between weak connections of the \nnetwork and drug targets of hypertension.\n\nThe genes in the largest connected part (i.e., core modules \\Rmnum{1} \nand \\Rmnum{2}) are involved in multiple pathways, and contribute to \na variety of biological functions. It is difficult to assign each of \nthese genes to a single biological function because of pleiotropy, \nnamely, one gene might influence many different biological processes \nin organisms~\\cite{HZ2012g}. However, the genes in the small non-core \nmodule \\Rmnum{3} with six nodes are involved in only two specific \npathways, rno03013 (RNA transport) and rno04141 (protein processing \nin endoplasmic reticulum (ER)), which indicates that the non-core \nmodule \\Rmnum{3} corresponds to clearly identified pathways and \nfunctions relatively independently. \n\nIn the pathway rno03013, the different RNA species produced in the \nnucleus are exported through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to the \ncytoplasm via mobile export receptors, which is fundamental for gene \nexpression. In the pathway rno04141, newly synthesized peptides enter \nthe ER via the sec61 pore and are glycosylated; correctly folded \nproteins are packaged into transport vesicles and misfolded proteins \nare retained within the ER lumen (cf. KEGG PATHWAY Database).\n\n\n\\section{Summary and concluding remarks}\n\\label{sec:5}\n\nHypertension is a cardiovascular disease associated with long-term \ninteraction between genetic and environmental factors. In this study, \nwe use pathways data to obtain backwards the relationships between \nthe hypertension-related genes, try to extract the complex \ninteractions between genes through calculating statistical \ncharacteristics and analyzing modular structure of the network.\n\nThe pathway-based gene network has the following characteristics: \n({\\romannumeral {1}}) The network does not obey a power-law degree distribution \nand thus is not of a scale-free property. The seven hub genes that \nare identified by integrated centrality $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}>0.71$ are: \n{\\it Jun}, {\\it Rps6kb1}, {\\it Cycs}, {\\it Creb3l2}, {\\it Cdk4}, \n{\\it Actg1} and {\\it RT1-Da}; they are key (feature) genes involved \nin the formation of hypertension. \n({\\romannumeral {2}}) The network shows the small-world property (i.e., a small \n$L$ and a large $C$), which reveals the direct influence of these hub \ngenes on hypertension from another perspective. \n({\\romannumeral {3}}) The network has a modular structure. The weak connections \nof the network can be visualized by its modular structure, which can \nhelp to screen out key hypertension-related genes or pathways.\n\nIn this paper, we construct the network model of hypertension-related \ngenes based on biological pathways. Among the seven hub genes \nidentified in this network, only {\\it Cdk4} is also a hub gene in the \ngene co-expression network of our previous study~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}. \nBesides {\\it Cdk4}, the three genes {\\it Shc1}, {\\it Fzd2} and \n{\\it Col4a1} with $C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}>0.60$ in the pathway-based gene \nnetwork are identified as the hub genes in the gene co-expression \nnetwork of Ref.~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}. Although we can see that more \nnodes will become hub genes and thus there will be more hub genes \noverlapped in the both networks if we lower the threshold of \n$C_{\\mathrm{intgr}}$, the hub genes in the two networks are impossible \nto be completely overlapped because the two networks are constructed \nfrom the different perspectives, i.e., based on the different \ncharacters of the genes. The results from this paper and the \ntheoretical analysis in Ref.~\\cite{WXHC2014pa} would complement each \nother. The seven hub genes in the pathway-based gene network, together \nwith the above-mentioned {\\it Shc1}, {\\it Fzd2} and {\\it Col4a1}, \nas well as {\\it Sdhb} of the highest $C_{b}$, can be regarded as \ncandidate genes or drug targets for further biological and medical \nresearch on their functions; in particular, the common hub gene \n{\\it Cdk4} of the both networks would be worth more attention.\n\nMoreover, the network may also be analyzed based on other functional \ncorrelation methods, such as GO analysis~\\cite{CGBC2011itbe}, to get \nmore molecular mechanisms about hypertension. In the next study, we \nwill develop weighted network models and explore the mutual \nregulatory relationships between genes of complex diseases using \ndynamical analysis. These studies will provide another perspective on \nexpounding the differentially expressed genes and finding new drug \ntargets for other serious diseases. Finally, we expect that the \ncomplex network approach can provide clues for exploring the \npathogenesis of critical illness from molecular perspective.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science \nFoundation of China (NSFC) (Grant Nos. 11365023 and 61263043), \nthe Projects of the Science and Technology Research and Development \nProgram of Baoji City (Grant Nos. 15RKX-1-5-14 and 15RKX-1-5-6), \nthe Key Project of Baoji University of Arts and Sciences (Grant No. \nZK14035), and the Joint Fund of Department of Science and Technology \nof Guizhou Province, Bureau of Science and Technology of Qiandongnan \nPrefecture, and Kaili University (Grant No. LH-2014-7231).

Hypertension is a complex disease caused by many \nreasons including genetic, physiological, psychological and even \nsocial factors. In this paper, based on the information of biological \npathways, we construct a network model of hypertension-related genes \nof the salt-sensitive rat to explore the interrelationship between \ngenes. Statistical and topological characteristics show that the \nnetwork has the small-world but not scale-free property, and \nexhibits a modular structure, revealing compact and complex \nconnections among these genes. By the threshold of integrated \ncentrality larger than $0.71$, seven key hub genes are found: \n{\\it Jun}, {\\it Rps6kb1}, {\\it Cycs}, {\\it Creb3l2}, {\\it Cdk4}, \n{\\it Actg1} and {\\it RT1-Da}. These genes should play an important \nrole in hypertension, suggesting that the treatment of hypertension \nshould focus on the combination of drugs on multiple genes.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keyword}\nComplex network; Hypertension; Hub gene; Pathway; Modular structure\n\n\n\\end{keyword}\n\n\\end{frontmatter}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:1}\n\nThe study of complex systems clearly shows that the global behavior \nof systems is determined by their structure rather than by the \nproperties of their individual parts. The complex network approach \nhas become a powerful tool for studying complex systems, and the \nglobal properties of systems are usually studied by abstracting \nindividual elements of systems into nodes and reducing interactions \nbetween elements to edges between \nnodes~\\cite{WS1998n,BA1999s,S2001n,N2003sr,WYY2006pre}. Such an \napproach has been widely applied to understanding gene functions in \nbiological and medical \nresearch~\\cite{JTA2000n,BO2004nrg,KH2007pa,TSP2009pa,D2011pa}.\n\nEssential hypertension, which accounts for about $90\\%$--$95\\%$ of \nall cases of hypertension~\\cite{CO2000c}, is a disease caused by \nlong-term interaction between genetic and environmental factors, and \nsalt is one of the important environmental factors~\\cite{CNB2012h}. \nThe blood pressure response to salt loading or salt restriction is \nheterogeneous among individuals, which is known as salt \nsensitivity~\\cite{WFF2001h,A2002ije,RIV2007ndt}. Salt sensitivity is \nthe genetic susceptibility of individual blood pressure response to \nsalt, and is an intermediate phenotype of essential \nhypertension~\\cite{R2000pr,C2006nrg}. The people who suffer the \nsalt-sensitive (SS) hypertension account for about $50\\%$ of \nhypertensive patients~\\cite{RIV2007ndt}. Although the clinical \nresearch and treatment of hypertension have improved \ndramatically~\\cite{CCDN2000c,WMCK2004h,SJJ2011chr}, its molecular \nmechanisms and pathologies involved are still difficult to ascertain.\n\nMany omic data have been obtained and become available through \nadvanced high-throughput technologies, which provide the basis for \nstudying the relationship of biological data by network \napproach~\\cite{BO2004nrg,D2011pa}. Various biomolecular networks \nhave been constructed to discover essential functions and mechanisms \nof biological phenomena~\\cite{JTA2000n,KH2007pa,TSP2009pa}. For \ninstance, Censi et al. studied the gene regulatory networks induced \nin heart tissue by atrial fibrillation~\\cite{CGBC2011itbe}. \nDemicheli and Coradini analyzed breast cancer behavior using gene \nregulatory networks~\\cite{DC2011ao}. Therefore, it is of \nsignificance to understand hypertension disease at system level using \nthe complex network approach.\n\nIn our previous study~\\cite{WXHC2014pa}, we constructed a \nhypertension-related gene co-expression network by focusing on the \nanalysis of gene expression data (GED)~\\cite{LLW2008pg} among the \nDahl SS rat~\\cite{DHT1962jem,R1982h} and two consomic rat \nstrains~\\cite{D1998jh,CRJ2004jp}, where the $335$ nodes are \nindividual genes and the connections are derived from the expression \ncorrelations. This is a theoretical analysis based on GED to \ndetermine the key hub genes (nodes) and explore the relationship \nbetween these hub genes and hypertension. However, to get more \nbiologically relevant information about hypertension, a pathway-based \ngene network should also be constructed using the actual biological \ncorrelations.\n\nIn the present work, we attempt to study the genes that are involved \nin SS hypertension based on the information of biological pathways. \nA biological pathway is a series of actions among molecules in a cell \nthat leads to a certain product or a change in a \ncell~\\cite{K2002s,DGvH2003bb}. Such a pathway can trigger the \nassembly of new molecules or turn genes on and off. Since biological \npathways such as metabolic and signal transduction pathways can \ndirectly be viewed as interconnected processes of molecular species \nin the cell~\\cite{K2002s,DGvH2003bb}; therefore, constructing a \npathway-based gene network could help to disentangle the actual \nbiological interactions between genes. \n\nIn this paper, we will construct the network model of \nhypertension-related genes according to whether these genes are \ninvolved in the same pathways in the KEGG\\footnote{\nKEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) website: \nhttp://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/.} \ndatabase. Network approach will be employed to investigate the \npossible relations between network structure and hypertension-related \ngenes based on these data. Through calculating several statistical \nindices and analyzing topological characteristics of the network, we \nfind that the pathway-based gene network exhibits the small-world but \nnot scale-free property. Meanwhile, the network also exhibits a \nmodular structure: the nodes of the network can be properly divided \ninto groups within which the nodes are highly connected, but between \nwhich they are much less connected. The modular structure analysis \ncan visualize the weak connections of the network, and thus help us \nto study drug targets of hypertension. The results from this paper \nand the analysis in Ref.~\\cite{WXHC2014pa} would complement each other.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In \nSection~\\ref{sec:2}, we introduce the data source and construct the \npathway-based gene network model of hypertension. In \nSection~\\ref{sec:3}, we analyze the statistical and topological \ncharacteristics of the gene network. The modular structure of the \nnetwork is presented in Section~\\ref{sec:4}, while \nSection~\\ref{sec:5} presents summary and concluding remarks.\n\n\n\\section{Data source and network construction}\n\\label{sec:2}\n\nThe Dahl SS rat, proposed by Dahl et al. in the early \n1960s~\\cite{DHT1962jem,R1982h}, is a widely used genetic model of \nhuman hypertension. The consomic rat strains, used as the \nnormotensive control for the Dahl SS rat, are generated by \nsubstituting a chromosome or a part of a chromosome from a normal \nrat strain for the corresponding genomic region of the SS \nrat~\\cite{LLW2008pg,D1998jh,CRJ2004jp}. Previous research has \nshown that substitution of chromosome 13 or 18 can attenuate \nhypertension~\\cite{JLG2005pg,LLW2008pg}. Our study will focus on the \nhypertension-related genes listed in Ref.~\\cite{LLW2008pg} by \nanalysis of biological pathways.\n\nLet us consider an undirected network $G_{H}=(V_{H},E_{H})$, where \n$V_{H}=\\{v_{i}\\}$ $(i=1,2,\\ldots,N)$ denotes the set of $N$ nodes, \nand $E_{H}=\\{v_i,v_j\\}$ the set of edges or connections between \nnodes. We will use the following notation: $A_{ij}=1$ indicates that \nthere is an edge between nodes $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$; and $A_{ij}=0$ \notherwise. Our pathway-based gene network model is constructed in \ntwo steps.\n\n{\\it Step 1. Selection of genes according to pathways}\n\nWe first extract nodes from the $335$ different hypertension-related \ngenes\\footnote{\nAll these genes are given in Table S2 (Excel file) of Supplemental \nFigures and Tables of Ref.~\\cite{LLW2008pg}, which can be readily \naccessed from the website: \nhttp://physiolgenomics.physiology.org/content/34/1/54/suppl/DC1.} \ngiven in Ref.~\\cite{LLW2008pg} based on the KEGG PATHWAY Database. \nFrom this Database, we can easily obtain the information of whether \na gene is involved in single or multiple pathways. Here, we only \nconsider the pathways including hypertension-related genes, and the \ngenes not involved in any pathway are excluded from our study. Thus, \nthe $N=90$ hypertension-related genes, which are involved in $157$ \npathways in the KEGG Database~\\cite{W2013DScD}, are extracted to \nserve as nodes of the network model, where each node represents an \nindividual gene shown as gene symbol or CloneID. Examples of ten \ngenes involved in one or more pathways are shown in \nTable~\\ref{gene.vs.pathway}; here, a pathway is represented by the \nentry name of the Database, called the KEGG object identifier \nconsisting of a database-dependent prefix and a five-digit number \n(such as rno04066, where the prefix ``rno'' designates the species \nto be rat).\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\scriptsize\n\\caption{Examples of the correspondence between genes and pathways.}\n\\label{gene.vs.pathway}\n\\begin{tabular}[c]{llrll}\n\\hline\nGene  & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad & Gene ID  & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad & Pathway(s)\\\\\n\\hline\n{\\it Timp1}     && 116{\\,}510{\\ } && rno04066\\\\\n{\\it Casp6}     &&  83{\\,}584{\\ } && rno04210\\\\\n{\\it Ank3}      && 361{\\,}833{\\ } && rno05205\\\\\n{\\it Aqp1}      &&  25{\\,}240{\\ } && rno04964, rno04976\\\\\n{\\it Kcnj1}     &&  24{\\,}521{\\ } && rno04960, rno04971\\\\\n{\\it Ctsd}      && 171{\\,}293{\\ } && rno04142, rno05152\\\\\n{\\it Hist1h2ai} && 502{\\,}129{\\ } && rno05034, rno05322\\\\\n{\\it Sdc1}      &&  25{\\,}216{\\ } && rno04512, rno04514, rno05144, rno05205\\\\\n{\\it Col4a1}    && 290{\\,}905{\\ } && rno04151, rno04510, rno04512, rno04974, rno05146, rno05200, rno05222\\\\\n{\\it Fzd2}      &&  64{\\,}512{\\ } && rno04310, rno04390, rno04916, rno05166, rno05200, rno05205, rno05217\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n{\\it Step 2.
