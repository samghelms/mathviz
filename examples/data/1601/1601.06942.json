The discovery of the wonder\nmaterial graphene in conjunction with the large band gap insulator hexagonal\nboron nitride (h-BN) has raised new hopes for realization of this new\ncollective many body state.\nRecently, superconductivity at temperatures above liquid Helium\nhas been reported in doped monolayer graphene\nby four groups, amplifying  interest in\nquantum coherent phenomena in graphene. \\cite{SuperGr}\n\nMonolayer graphene is an atomically flat, gapless semiconductor with near\nidentical conduction and valence bands.\nSpatially separated electron-doped and hole-doped\nmonolayers can be completely insulated from each other with just a few atomic layers of h-BN \\cite{Gorbachev2012,Geim2013}.  With such small spatial\nseparations,\nelectron-hole pairing by direct Coulomb attraction\nwould be expected to be strong \\cite{Mink,Min2008,comment}.  However\nthe linear dispersion of the monolayer graphene\nenergy bands results in very strong Coulomb screening of the electron-hole pairing\nattraction, and this suppresses superfluidity in coupled electron-hole graphene monolayers  \\cite{Lozovik2012,Gorbachev2012}.\nTo overcome the strong screening,  Refs.\\  {\\hspace{-1 ex} \\nocite{{Perali2013}}\\citenum{{Perali2013}}}\nand {\\hspace{-1 ex} \\nocite{{Zarenia2014}}\\citenum{{Zarenia2014}}} proposed using coupled electron-hole\ngraphene multilayers.  Using multilayers takes advantage of the  nonlinear dispersion\nof their energy bands  \\cite{McCann,Min2008b},  and the\nexistence of a  gap between the conduction and valence bands when a gate potential is applied.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{fig1.eps}\n\\caption{(a)  Lowest single-particle energy subbands $\\epsilon_j(k_y), j=1,2,\\dots$ in an armchair graphene nanoribbon of width $W=2$ nm.\n(b) Corresponding density of states DOS$(E)$ in  nanoribbon. Van Hove singularities are visible at  bottom of each subband.}\n\\label{DOS}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nHere we propose a new design to boost electron-hole pairing and the\nonset of superfluidity using nanoribbons etched in monolayer\ngraphene.\nMonolayer sheets of graphene are promising candidates for applications in transparent conductive\nfilms, electronic and opto-electronic devices, actuators, sensors, composites,\nand more.  However a serious limitation of graphene monolayers is that field-effect transistor (FET) devices are not possible because the massless nature of the electrons prevents electron\nconfinement in graphene.\nQuasi-one-dimensional graphene nanoribbons with tuneable  band gaps  resolve this  issue, with important implications for the fabrication of novel and ultrafast\nelectronic nanodevices.   For example, FET devices with 100 GHz switching frequencies\nhave been fabricated using graphene nanoribbons \\cite{Lin2010}.\nThe nanoribbon edges can be terminated using a variety of different atoms, which opens up application opportunities, in particular for nanoribbons in polymer hosts for\nfabrication of novel composite materials \\cite{Dimiev2011,Dimiev2013}.\nFinally, graphene nanoribbons are showing great promise  as electrode materials for batteries and supercapacitors \\cite{Li2013}.\n\nThe electronic properties of graphene nanoribbons depend on the type of edge\ntermination \\cite{Kim2007}. We focus on armchair-edge terminated nanoribbons since (i) their subbands\nare parabolic around their minima (Fig.\\ \\ref{DOS}(a)), (ii) there is a sizeable semiconductor-like\nenergy gap between the conduction\nand valence bands, and (iii) the valley degeneracy of monolayer graphene is lifted.\nThese properties combine to greatly reduce the strength of screening of the  electron-hole pairing\ninteraction. Note that uniform armchair graphene nanoribbons of\nwidths  $W\\ll 10$ nm have recently been fabricated \\cite{Cai}.\n\nFigure  \\ref{schematic} shows the device we are proposing.  It consists of two armchair-edge terminated monolayer graphene nanoribbons, one electron-doped and the other hole-doped,    separated by a few atomic layers of a h-BN insulating barrier. The nanoribbons are independently contacted, and\ntop and back metal gates control the carrier densities.\n\n \\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{fig2.eps}\n\\caption{Proposed device.

Figure\n\\ref{DOS}(b)  shows the corresponding density of states DOS$(E)$.\nThe van Hove singularities coincide with the bottom of each subband.\n\nNot only the  finite width of the nanoribbons but also their multiple occupied subbands make the system only\nquasi-one-dimensional.  In addition, in the superfluid state the energy gap mixes close-by subbands.  The quasi-one-dimensionality together with the subband mixing  will\nsuppress order parameter fluctuations that are responsible for\ndestroying superfluidity in a pure one-dimensional system.  For these reasons we can\ncalculate  properties of the superfluid ground state\nusing mean field theory.\n\nRecently Ref.\\ {\\hspace{-1 ex} \\nocite{{Abergel}}\\citenum{{Abergel}}} discussed a quasi-condensate of excitons\nin coupled electron-hole one-dimensional wires using the weak-coupled BCS\ngap equation in the low density limit with only the lowest subband\ncontributing to the pairing, and with screening neglected.  Since only one\nchannel was considered, there are no shape resonance effects\nat finite densities.  Also, because of the one dimensionality, fluctuations of the order parameter\nshould be severe  and would strongly suppress\nsuperfluidity.   Interestingly, Ref.\\ {\\hspace{-1 ex} \\nocite{{Abergel}}\\citenum{{Abergel}}} argues that even in the one-channel case, the finite size of the\nnanoribbons would allow for short range superfluid correlations.\nIn our case the many available channels due to the multiple subbands involved\nin the pairing  allow for a  suppression of the critical\nfluctuations and it should be straightforward to observe conventional long range superfluidity.\n\nOur calculations are for coupled electron-hole armchair graphene\nnanoribbons of equal width $W$ and equal  (two-dimensional) electron and hole densities $n=( r_0W)^{-1}$, where $r_0$ is the average  inter-particle spacing  along the\nnanoribbon.   The\nsubbands $\\epsilon_j(k_y),\\  j=1,2,\\dots$ are identical for the  electrons and holes.\n\nBecause of the multiple subband structure, the zero temperature mean field equations for the superfluid state acquire an additional index for the subband $j$.

When $E_F$ enters a subband,\n$\\mu$ has a dip.  This is in contrast to the peak seen in the superfluid gap, and it is a shape antiresonance\ncaused by the shape-resonance-generated peak in the gap.\nAs $d$ is decreased and the pairing strength weakens, $\\mu$ increases towards  $E_F$ and the shape (anti)resonances become sizeable, indicating\nthat the system has entered the BCS-BEC crossover regime.\nIn the case of $d=2$nm,  $\\mu\\ll E_F$ and the shape (anti)resonances are completely  smoothed out.  This is a result\nof  large superfluid gaps and it signals that the system is in the  strong pairing BEC regime.\nWhen the density increases, the system always\nevolves towards the weaker pairing BCS regime for all values of $d$, with $\\mu$ eventually arriving at $E_F$.\n\nThe average pair size of the Cooper pairs $\\xi_j$ in\nsubband $j$ is defined as the expectation value of the square of the\nrelative coordinate of the Cooper pairs with respect to the square of the\nBCS wave function projected in the subband.

The quasi-one-dimensional confinement and the superfluid shape resonances due to quantum size\neffects both play an important role here.  The van Hove singularities in the densities of states act\nnon-linearly through the gap\nequation to significantly enhance the magnitude of the superfluid gaps.\nIn the range of nanoribbon densities and barrier separations considered, we find that the electron-hole superfluid is for the most part in the strongly coupled pairing regime, and so Coulomb screening effects are expected to be weak.\n\nWhen the superfluid gaps are comparable to the subband energy separations, the gaps\nmix the subbands and this results in a rounding of the shape resonances. This effect is most pronounced for small separations between the nanoribbons where  the  electron-hole coupling is particularly strong.\nFor larger separations, the electron-hole coupling is weaker and the superfluid gaps are smaller.  This results in weaker\nsubband mixing.  When this is the case, the shape resonances are sharper which strengthens the\nlocal amplification of the gaps.\n\nIn our quasi-one-dimensional system there is no direct\nlink between the superfluid transition temperature and\nthe size of the superfluid gaps calculated within mean field.\nIn our proposed device the zero temperature superfluid gaps are comparable\nto the Fermi energy, and can be of order of hundreds of meV.\nThus high transition temperature electron-hole superfluidity\ncould be expected, with  properties that are tuneable by changing the density.  The device configurations we propose are experimentally realizable with currently available technologies.  A superlattice formed of such nanoribbon devices\ncould further stabilize the electron-hole superfluid phase over  large areas.\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{Lozovik} Lozovik, Yu.

When $E_F$ enters a subband,\n$\\mu$ has a dip.  This is in contrast to the peak seen in the superfluid gap, and it is a shape antiresonance\ncaused by the shape-resonance-generated peak in the gap.\nAs $d$ is decreased and the pairing strength weakens, $\\mu$ increases towards  $E_F$ and the shape (anti)resonances become sizeable, indicating\nthat the system has entered the BCS-BEC crossover regime.\nIn the case of $d=2$nm,  $\\mu\\ll E_F$ and the shape (anti)resonances are completely  smoothed out.  This is a result\nof  large superfluid gaps and it signals that the system is in the  strong pairing BEC regime.\nWhen the density increases, the system always\nevolves towards the weaker pairing BCS regime for all values of $d$, with $\\mu$ eventually arriving at $E_F$.\n\nThe average pair size of the Cooper pairs $\\xi_j$ in\nsubband $j$ is defined as the expectation value of the square of the\nrelative coordinate of the Cooper pairs with respect to the square of the\nBCS wave function projected in the subband.
