Proposals to recover\ngauge-invariant charge-carrying matter fields in terms of such formal\nexpressions appeared already a long time before renormalization theory \\cite\n{Jor}. They played no role in the discovery of renormalized perturbation\ntheory, but they re-appeared later in Mandelstam's proposal to replace the\nperturbative gauge theoretic setting of QED by one which uses solely Hilbert\nspace gauge-invariant field strengths instead of Krein space vector\npotentials \\cite{Mand}. Attempts to obtain mathematical control of such\nnon-linear and non-local composites as (\\ref{com}) within renormalized\nperturbation theory remained without success.\n\nThe present paper solves this old problem by using massive string-local\nvector potentials which are defined as semi-infinite spacelike\nline-integrals over field strengths. They are covariant fields which\nmaintain the Hilbert space positivity and in contrast to the Proca\npotentials permit, as aforementioned, smooth $m\\rightarrow 0$ limits of\ntheir vacuum expectation values. Their use opens new areas of exploration\nwhich are outside the physical range of gauge theory.\n\nIn the new setting the lowest order perturbative interaction densities are\ndefined in terms of Wick products of string-local covariant free vector\npotentials $A_{\\mu }(x,e)$ (obtained by integrating point-local field\nstrengths along spacelike semi-lines) with point-local free $s<1$ matter\nfields. The higher order interactions spread the string-localization of the\npotentials to the $s<1\\ $matter fields so that their zero order pl fields\nturn into higher order (in a certain sense even stronger sl than the\npotentials) sl $\\Psi (x,e)~$fields. These sl matter fields are the\nelementary interacting matter fields of perturbation theory which replace\nthe composite expressions in the Krein fields (\\ref{com}).\n\nThe problem is then to extend renormalization theory from pl to sl fields.\nThe feasibility of such a project relies on the observation that sl fields\nhave a better short distance behavior than their pl counterparts. Whereas\nthe short distance dimension $d_{sd~}$of pl free field tensor-potentials\nincreases with spin as $d_{sd}^{s}=s+1,$ that of their string-local siblings\nremains at $d_{sd}^{s}=1$ \\textit{independent of} $s.~$This implies that\nthere is no problems to construct interaction densities \\textit{for any spin\nwithin the power-counting bound (PCB)} $d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4$ of\nrenormalizability$.~$In the present paper the spin of the $s\\geq 1~$higher\nspin fields will be integer; for spinor fields there are corresponding\nresults.\n\nHowever in contrast to interactions between $s<1~$pl fields, for which the\nfirst order PCB is the only restriction, there is an additional requirement\nfor sl fields which has no pl counterpart and bears no relation to short\ndistance properties. Higher order terms will in general not remain sl but\nrather lead to a \\textit{total delocalization}; such situations turn out to\nbe inconsistent with the principles of QFT. Heuristically this new\nphenomenon can be understood in terms of the $x$-integration in inner\npropagator lines which, in case of $x$ being the starting point of a\nsemi-infinite spacelike line $x+\\mathbb{R}_{+}e$ converts the\nstring-localization into a complete delocalization. The avoidance of this\ntotal delocalization imposes a severe conditions on the interaction density.\nIn contrast to the PCB short distance renormalizability requirement the new\nrestriction maintains the sl of those fields whose vacuum expectation values\none wants to computes but prevents the dependence on \"inner\" $e^{\\prime }s.$\nThe maintenance of string-localization is important for the physical\nlong-distance properties.\n\nIt vaguely corresponds to the requirement of gauge invariance. But whereas\nthe latter bears no direct relation to the foundational principles of QFT\n(The pl localization of gauge-dependent fields in a Krein space is not the\nphysical localization !), the prevention of total delocalization is directly\nrelated to the causal localization principles of QFT. Whereas the Krein\nspace asymptotic short distance properties probably agree with those in the\nsl Hilbert space setting\\footnote{\nThis would be necessary in order to secure the asymptotic freedom as a\nproperty which is consistent with positivity of QFT..}, the understanding of\nlong distance properties requires the use of sl fields. It is well-known\nthat in a Hilbert space setting there are no renormalizable interaction\ndensities involving pl $s\\geq 1~$fields.\n\nSome of these nonrenormalizable pl interactions turn out to be\nrenormalizable in terms of $s\\geq 1~$covariant sl fields. This is in\nparticular the case if one allows higher order short distance compensations\nbetween couplings containing fields of different spins (reminiscent of\ncompensations between different spin components in supersymmetry\nmultiplets). Those which are not renormalizable in the sl sense are in all\nlikelihood not models of QFT. This points to an interesting connection\nbetween perturbative renormalizability and causal localization properties.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to illustrate these new ideas in their\nsimplest possible low order perturbative context. Technically more demanding\ntasks, as the elaboration of an $n^{th}$ order Epstein-Glaser\nrenormalization theory which includes causal string-crossings, will be left\nto future publications.\n\nQuantum gauge theory also achieves a reduction from $d_{sd}=2$ to $\\dot{d}\n_{sd}=1$ in case of $s=1,$ but it accomplishes this not with a Hilbert space\npositivity maintaining weakening of localization from pl to sl, but rather\nwith the help of indefinite metric which permits compensations in\nintermediate states between positive and negative contributions by brute\nforce. If it were not be for the existence of a subset of gauge invariant\noperators (which includes the S-matrix), an indefinite metric setting would\nremain without physical content.\n\nThe Hilbert space setting of QT is the basis of its probabilistic\ninterpretation. It has no counterpart in the classical theory and hence one\ncannot rely on \"quantization\" to solve conceptual problems of interactions\ninvolving $s=1~$fields. Quantum gauge theory is the result of keeping pl $\ns\\geq 1$ fields at the prize of sacrificing positivity. Gauge symmetry is a\nlocal symmetry in classical electromagnetism; it bears no relation to the\nprinciples of QFT but rather enters QFT through the \"quantization\"\nparallelism to classical field theory\\footnote{\nThere are however classical limits of pl or sl free quantum fields in terms\nof expectation values in coherent states.}. Perturbative QFT needs no\nreference to Lagrangian quantization; it can be defined in terms of\ninteraction densities formed from covariant pl or sl free fields which can\nbe directly obtained from Wigner's positive energy representation theory of\nthe Poincar\\'{e} group.\n\nPerturbative gauge invariance is a way to extend the pl formalism to $s=1$\ninteractions in a Krein space in order to extract those quantities which do\nnot \"feel\" the presence of negative metric states (namely the local\nobservables and the S-matrix). It has been \"an amazingly successful\nplaceholder\" (Stora) for an unknown Hilbert space formulation within the\nstandard setting of perturbative QFT. The new sl Hilbert space setting\nextends the Hilbert space Wightman formulation for interacting $s<1$ pl\nfields to $s\\geq 1~$sl fields for which the test-function smearing amounts\nto smearing in $x,$ using the smooth rapidly deceasing test functions $f(x))$\n\\textit{and} smearing in $e,$ using smooth compact supported functions $h(e)$\nin the $d=1+2$ de Sitter space of spacelike directions $e,~e^{2}=-1$\n\\footnote{\nThe present experience with perturbation theory suggests that interacting\nWightman fields with $s\\geq 1$ exist only in the form of sl fields.}$.$ The\nmain purpose of the present work is to convince the reader that the\nbeginnings of a theory for which gauge theory is the placeholder already\nexist.\n\nThe idea of constructing string-localized fields in Hilbert space can be\ntraced back to the solution of the localization properties of Wigner's zero\nmass infinite spin representation class \\cite{BGL} \\cite{MSY} in terms of\nthe \\textit{modular localization theory} of algebraic QFT (a\nhistoric/philosophical view can be found in \\cite{SHPMP}). But, as it is\noften the case, the historic context which led to a new view of QFT may turn\nout to be less important for its use in actual problems; the construction of\nstring-local fields and their use in a new perturbative setting does not\nrequire knowledge about modular localization.\n\nA prior result from algebraic QFT (AQFT) which highlighted the \\textit{\nnaturalness of string-localization} was obtained by Buchholz and Fredenhagen\nin \\cite{Bu-Fr}. Their theorem was formulated and proven in the\noperator-algebraic setting; re-expressing its physical content in terms of\nquantum fields it states:\n\n\\textbf{Theorem: }\\textit{The field theoretic content of an asymptotically\ncomplete QFT with a mass gap and local observables can be fully accounted\nfor in terms of string-local covariant fields}$~\\Psi (x,e)$\\textit{\\\nlocalized on spacelike semi-lines}$~x+R_{+}e~e^{2}=-1.$\\textit{\\ Point-local\nobservable fields correspond to the special case of }$e$\\textit{-independent \n}$\\Psi ^{\\prime }s$. \\textit{QFT does not need fields with weaker than\nstringlike localization properties (as e.g. localization on spacelike\nhypersurfaces)}.\n\nThe Hilbert space of such a theory can be described as a Wigner-Fock Hilbert\nspace spanned by those particle states which the (LSZ or Haag-Ruelle)\nscattering theory associates asymptotically with the string-local fields.\nSince functional analytic and operator-algebraic tools are not available in\nindefinite metric Krein spaces, the gauge theoretic setting is strictly\nlimited to the combinatorial rules of finite order renormalized perturbation\ntheory whereas nonperturbative theorems (TCP, Spin\\&Statistics, scattering\ntheory,...) cannot be derived. On the other hand most mathematical tools of\n(Wightman) QFT\\ remain valid for string-local fields; hence large parts of\ntextbook presentation of nonperturbative QFT can be adjusted to the new\nsituation.\n\nMore specific results come from the new perturbation theory of sl fields.\nWhereas positivity-preserving renormalizable interactions between\npoint-local fields are limited to low spins $s<1,$ renormalizable\ninteractions containing $s\\geq 1$ fields in a Hilbert space setting require\na weakening of localization from point- to string-local fields \\cite{Rio} \n\\cite{vector}. Couplings which even remain nonrenormalizable in a\nstring-local setting are not expected to represent models of QFT.\n\nThe a priory knowledge that the Hilbert space in models with a mass gap can\nbe identified with a Wigner-Fock particle space turns out to be very useful\nin the perturbative construction\\footnote{\nIt is important that this Fock spaces refers to asymptotic fields\n(particles); the use of a Fock space at finite times is forbidden by \"Haag's\ntheorem\" \\cite{Haag}.}. This well understood situation is also a good\nstarting point for investigating massless limits in which the standard\nWigner particle structure is lost (which manifests itself in terms of\ninfrared divergencies) and the appropriate Hilbert space has to be\nconstructed from the massless limit of the massive correlation functions \n\\cite{St-Wi}. Most deep unsolved problems of QFT, in particular a spacetime\nunderstanding of infrared properties which account for the conceptual\nchanges of large time scattering properties in QED and are responsible for\nconfinement in QCD, are connected with interactions involving massless\nvector potentials. Already for free fields the massless field is most\nconveniently constructed through the massless limit of the free massive sl\ncorrelation functions.\n\nIn view of the strong relation between causal localization and Hilbert space\npositivity one cannot expect that GT accounts for the correct causal\nlocalization properties. The absence of of positivity (unitarity) is not\nonly affecting issues of Hermitian adjoints and unitarity, but also spoils\nthe foundational causality property of QFT. The positivity and the ensuing\nstring-localization is particularly important for large distance properties\nwhich usually announce their presence through infrared divergencies. Long\ndistance problems do not occur in $s<1$ interactions; their physical\nunderstanding is inexorably related to properties of $s\\geq 1$ interacting\nsl fields. Although not yet established, one expects that the short distance\nasymptotic freedom behavior of the gauge dependent matter fields will be\nconfirmed in the sl Hilbert space theory.\n\nThe role of sl fields will be illustrated in two problems. One problem, the\nso-called \"violation of Haag duality\", is closely related to the\nAharonov-Bohm effect. It shows that the use of Hilbert space string-local\nvector potentials in a Wilson loop leads to a topological effect which is\nabsent for gauge theoretic point-like potentials in Krein space and has\ngeneralizations to all massless $s\\geq 1$ fields. The somewhat \"eery\nfeelings\" about an apparent causality violation (which partially account for\nthe popularity of the A-B effect) can be traced back to the use of the\npoint-local potentials of gauge theory; they disappear once one uses instead\ntheir covariant string-local counter-part which perceive the difference\nbetween Haag suality and the more general Einstein causality.\n\nThe main problem posed by string-local fields is the construction of the\ncorrect first order interaction densities. It is well-known that the\nrequirement of PCB $d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4~$(the prerequisite for\nrenormalizability) only permits pl couplings between fields of low spin $s<1$\nwith $d_{sd}=1$ or $3/2~$(for $s=1/2$).~String-local fields, whose short\ndistance dimension is $d_{sd}=1$ for bosons (and $3/2$ for fermions \\textit{\nindependent of }$s),$ permit PCB couplings for any spin.\n\nBut, as already mentioned before, there exists an additional rather severe\nrestriction on sl interaction-densities which has no counterpart for\nrenormalizable interactions between $s<1$ pl fields. Most string-local\ninteractions within $d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4~$lead to a \\textit{total\ndelocalization in higher orders}, which removes them from the list of\npotential candidates for a QFT model. This restriction will be exemplified\nfor three models: couplings of massive string-local vector mesons to complex\nfields (massive QED), to Hermitian fields (the Higgs model) and self-coupled\nmassive vector mesons.\n\nThe presence of self-coupled massive vector mesons lead to a new phenomenon;\nit is the only known coupling for which the first order PCB does not imply\nrenormalizability; or to formulate it in a historical context: passing from\nthe 4-Fermi interaction to intermediate self-interacting massive vector\nmesons improves the short distance properties so that the coupling leads to\nfirst order PCB, but fails in second order. The culprit is a second order\n\"induced\" $d_{sd}=5$ self-coupling which can only be compensated by\nenlarging the first order coupling by a $A\\cdot AH$ coupling with a scalar\nHermitian $H$ field whose second order iteration contains a compensating $H$\n-independent term. Whereas the massive (scalar, spinor) vector mesons of QED\ndo not require the presence of a (or several) $H,~$the second order PCB of\nstring-local massive Y-M and QCD cannot be maintained without a compensating \n$H$-coupling$.~$\n\nThe combination of a shift in the complex field space of a massless scalar\nQED (SSB \"breaking of gauge symmetry\") and a subsequent reality adjustment\nby an operator gauge transformation (no counterpart in SSB) leads also to\nthe correct interaction density, but this \"Higgs mechanism\" bears no\nphysical relation with the intrinsic origin of the second order induced (not\npostulated !) Mexican hat potential of a $H$ self-interaction (section 4).\nA\\ \\ genuine physical SSB breaking on the other hand leaves its intrinsic\n(i.e. independent of by what prescription it was obtained) physical mark on\nthe final model and there is simply none. The identically conserved Maxwell\ncurrent $j_{\\mu }=\\partial ^{\\nu }F_{\\mu \\nu }~$of an abelian massive vector\nmeson leads to a screened (and not to spontaneously broken) charge \\cite\n{vector}. Interactions between Hermitian fields and massive vector mesons\nare (as their complex counterparts) fully accounted for by the BRST gauge\ninvariance of the S-matrix $\\mathfrak{s}S=0~$or its spacetime Hilbert space\ncounterpart namely the independence of $S$ on string directions $d_{e}S=0.$\n\nThe perturbative string-local field theory (SLFT) shares many \\textit{formal}\nsimilarities with gauge theory (GT). This is particularly evident if one\nformulates GT not in terms of Feynman rules but instead uses the so-called\ncausal gauge invariant operator setting (CGI) \\cite{Scharf}. The reason is\nthat gauge invariance must hold on-shell but is violated off-shell. This\nmakes it difficult to discuss properties as positivity (unitarity), whose\nvalidity in gauge theories is \\textit{limited to the on-shell restrictions}\nof correlation functions (i.e. the S-matrix). In the CGI operator\nformulation of the BRST gauge formalism \\cite{Scharf} \\cite{Aste} \\cite{BDSV}\nthe perturbative implementation is focussed on the construction on the\nS-operator which fulfills $\\mathfrak{s}S=0$ where $\\mathfrak{s}$ is the\nnilpotent BRST s-operation; in this way the construction of the\ngauge-invariant S-operator is separated from the construction of the less\ninteresting gauge dependent correlation functions.\n\nThe implementation of the string-independence of the S-matrix and the\nindependence of \"inner\" strings of correlation functions of string-local\nfields is achieved with the help of a differential form calculus on the $\nd=1+2~$de Sitter space of string directions. Unlike GT with its\ncohomological BRST formalism based on a nilpotent $\\mathfrak{s}$-operation,\nwhose physical range is restricted to local observables and the perturbative\nS-matrix, the SLFT is a full QFT which contains the important string-local\nphysical matter fields whose LSZ limits connect the causal localization\nprinciples implemented in terms of fields and their charge-carrying local\nequivalence classes with the observable world of individual particles just\nas in point-local Hilbert space QFTs. But the appearance of the $e$\n-dependence in going from on- to off-shell complicates the analytic\nconnection between scattering amplitudes and correlation functions.\n\nIt is interesting to use some hindsight from this new developments for\nlooking back at the origin of modern GT. In the 't Hooft-Veltman paper on\nthe renormalization of nonabelian gauge theory the important issue was the\nverification of the unitarity of the S-matrix (ignoring infrared problems).\nWhat they achieved with the help of lengthy \"by hand\" calculations was\nafterwards \"streamlined\" by adding formal tools. Starting with\nFaddeev-Popov, being enriched by Slavnov, the formal polishing finally\nreached its present perfection in the hands of Becchi, Rouet, Stora and\nTuytin. It would be impossible for scholars of QFT to derive the BRST gauge\nformalism from the principles of QFT; they remain useful inventions for\nextracting a physical subtheory (in particular the S-matrix) from an\nunphysical description in Krein space.\n\nThe SLFT Hilbert space setting contains only physical degrees of freedom.\nBut this conceptual economy leads to new and even somewhat surprising\nconcepts. The massive pl Proca field $A_{\\mu }^{P}(x)$ turns out to lead to\na \\textit{pair} of sl fields, a sl vector potential $A_{\\mu }(x,e)~$\\textit{\nand} an sl scalar field $\\phi (x,e)$. Both fields appear in the interaction,\nbut in the zero mass limit only the sl $A_{\\mu }~$survives$.$This has a\nsurprising analogy with the appearance of short range vector potentials in\nthe BCS theory of superconductivity. In this analogy the bosonic $\\phi $\nfield corresponds to the Cooper pairs. As the $\\phi $ field, the Cooper\npairs result from a reorganization of existing degrees of freedom.\n\nNeither in the many-body quantum mechanical description of BCS\nsuperconductivity which leads to London's short range vector potentials, nor\nfor the description of QFT interactions of massive abelian vector mesons\nwith matter one needs new (e.g. Higgs) degrees of freedom. The QFT\ncounterpart of the Cooper pair regrouping are the $\\phi $ fields; it will be\nshown that they are an indispensable epiphenomenon of interacting massive\nvector mesons in a Hilbert space. This clears the way for asking the\nquestion why one needs $H$-fields in the presence of self-interacting\nmassive vector mesons. The answer has already been given in \\cite{vector}\nand will receive additional attention in section 4.\n\nWhereas the SLFT Hilbert space formalism has many formal similarities with\nthe implementation of on-shell BRST gauge invariance (section 5) in the\noperator formulation of \"causal gauge invariance\" (CGI) of the University of\nZ\\\"{u}rich group published during the 90s \\cite{Scharf} \\cite{Aste}, its\nconceptual and calculational power reaches beyond when it comes to long\ndistance infrared problems which cannot be described in terms of an\nS-matrix. The correct analog of the long-range Coulomb interaction of\nquantum mechanics are the long distance properties of physical matter fields\ninteracting with massless sl vector potentials. In such cases the structure\nof a Wigner-Fock Hilbert space and an S-matrix acting in it breaks down and\nthe remaining objects from which the theory has to be reconstructed are the\nmassless limits of the sl correlation functions.\n\nThe next section presents the kinematics of SLFT i.e. relations between the\nstring-local free fields and their use in interaction densities for which\none does not need perturbative calculations. The third section addresses\nwhat the title of this paper promises. Some second order perturbative\nresults and their interpretation are presented in section 4; this section\nalso contains educated guesses about physical manifestations of infrared\nproperties. Section 5 presents formal analogies with the CGI operator\nformulation of the BRST formalism. The outlook contains comments about\nongoing calculations and conjectures about what one hopes to accomplish in\nthe future.\n\nMany of the ideas arose in extensive discussions over several years with\nJens Mund, but the responsibility for possible errors and less than perfect\npresentations rest on my shoulders.\n\n\\section{A Hilbert space alternative to local gauge theory, kinematical\naspects}\n\nMassive free spin $s\\geq 1$ fields are commonly described in terms of degree \n$s$ tensor potentials.

One usually resolves this\nproblem by abandoning positivity and maintaining the point-local field\nformalism which leads to gauge theory (GT). The prize to pay is well-known\nfrom quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the standard indefinite metric\n(Gupta-Bleuler) gauge setting: positivity can be recovered for local\nobservables, whereas charge-carrying fields remain outside its physical\nrange. The separation between physical and unphysical quantum fields is done\nin terms of gauge symmetry which is not a physical symmetry but a formal\ndevice to extract a physical subtheory.\n\nAlthough the standard gauge formalism is restricted to vector potentials,\nthe clash between zero mass point-local fields and positivity is a general\nphenomenon for all $s\\geq 1~$zero mass tensor potentials. It does not affect\nthe corresponding field strengths, but the short distance dimension of the\nlatter ($d_{sd}=2$ for $s=1)~$would prevent their use in renormalizable\ninteractions. For semi-integer spin the borderline is $s\\geq 3/2;$ such\nfields will play no role in this paper.\n\nAnother possibility is to keep the Hilbert space, but allow a weaker\nlocalization. The tightest covariant localization of fields beyond\npoint-like is causal localization on semi-infinite spacelike \"strings\"\n\\footnote{\nBeware that strings in String Theory are not string-local in the sense of\nlocal quantum physics.} $x+\\mathbb{R}_{+}e,~e^{2}=-1.~$It~is easy to\nconstruct $m>0~$covariant fields $\\Psi (x,e)~$in terms of semi-infinite line\nintegrals. Whereas the point-local (pl) Proca vector-potentials have no\nmassless limit, the correlation functions of their string-local (sl)\nsiblings pass without problems to their massless counterpart. The\nconstruction of free massive sl potentials in the same Hilbert space as\ntheir point-local counterparts guaranties that both belong to the same\nrelative localization class. They represent two different \"field\ncoordinatizations\" of the same theory, which (in the presence of\ninteractions) implies that their particle content and S-matrix are identical.\n\nThe perturbative use of string-local elementary matter fields $\\Psi (x,e)$\nin Hilbert space quantum field theory\\footnote{\nUnless stated otherwise, QFT refers to the Hilbert space setting of quantum\ntheory. $\\ $Gauge theory, which contains a Hilbert space subtheory, will be\nreferred to as GT.} (QFT) correspond to formally gauge invariant\nstring-local composites in terms of pl fields in GT\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\psi ^{K}(x)e^{ig\\int_{0}^{\\infty }A_{\\mu }^{K}(x+\\lambda e)e^{\\mu }d\\lambda\n}  \\label{com}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\psi^{K}(x)e^{ig\\int_{0}^{\\infty}A_{\\mu}^{K}(x+\\lambda e)e^{\\mu}d\\lambda}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msup><mi>\u03c8</mi><mi>K</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"false\"><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></msubsup></mstyle><mrow><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>K</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></msup></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04528.tex", "nexttext": "\n~To\n\nTo this point-local field one may associate two string-local fields, a\nvector potential $A_{\\mu }(x,e)$ and a scalar field $\\phi (x,e)~$\\cite{MSY},\nas well as two \"field-valued differential forms\" in $e$-space namely a\none-form $u(x,e)$ and a two-form $\\hat{u}(x,e)$ \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 27315, "prevtext": "\nwhere the superscript $K~$refers to the pl indefinite metric (Krein space\ninstead of Hilbert space) setting of GT.

They played no role in the discovery of renormalized perturbation\ntheory, but they re-appeared later in Mandelstam's proposal to replace the\nperturbative gauge theoretic setting of QED by one which uses solely Hilbert\nspace gauge-invariant field strengths instead of Krein space vector\npotentials \\cite{Mand}. Attempts to obtain mathematical control of such\nnon-linear and non-local composites as (\\ref{com}) within renormalized\nperturbation theory remained without success.\n\nThe present paper solves this old problem by using massive string-local\nvector potentials which are defined as semi-infinite spacelike\nline-integrals over field strengths. They are covariant fields which\nmaintain the Hilbert space positivity and in contrast to the Proca\npotentials permit, as aforementioned, smooth $m\\rightarrow 0$ limits of\ntheir vacuum expectation values.

Whereas\nthe short distance dimension $d_{sd~}$of pl free field tensor-potentials\nincreases with spin as $d_{sd}^{s}=s+1,$ that of their string-local siblings\nremains at $d_{sd}^{s}=1$ \\textit{independent of} $s.~$This implies that\nthere is no problems to construct interaction densities \\textit{for any spin\nwithin the power-counting bound (PCB)} $d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4$ of\nrenormalizability$.~$In the present paper the spin of the $s\\geq 1~$higher\nspin fields will be integer; for spinor fields there are corresponding\nresults.\n\nHowever in contrast to interactions between $s<1~$pl fields, for which the\nfirst order PCB is the only restriction, there is an additional requirement\nfor sl fields which has no pl counterpart and bears no relation to short\ndistance properties. Higher order terms will in general not remain sl but\nrather lead to a \\textit{total delocalization}; such situations turn out to\nbe inconsistent with the principles of QFT. Heuristically this new\nphenomenon can be understood in terms of the $x$-integration in inner\npropagator lines which, in case of $x$ being the starting point of a\nsemi-infinite spacelike line $x+\\mathbb{R}_{+}e$ converts the\nstring-localization into a complete delocalization. The avoidance of this\ntotal delocalization imposes a severe conditions on the interaction density.\nIn contrast to the PCB short distance renormalizability requirement the new\nrestriction maintains the sl of those fields whose vacuum expectation values\none wants to computes but prevents the dependence on \"inner\" $e^{\\prime }s.$\nThe maintenance of string-localization is important for the physical\nlong-distance properties.\n\nIt vaguely corresponds to the requirement of gauge invariance. But whereas\nthe latter bears no direct relation to the foundational principles of QFT\n(The pl localization of gauge-dependent fields in a Krein space is not the\nphysical localization !), the prevention of total delocalization is directly\nrelated to the causal localization principles of QFT. Whereas the Krein\nspace asymptotic short distance properties probably agree with those in the\nsl Hilbert space setting\\footnote{\nThis would be necessary in order to secure the asymptotic freedom as a\nproperty which is consistent with positivity of QFT..}, the understanding of\nlong distance properties requires the use of sl fields. It is well-known\nthat in a Hilbert space setting there are no renormalizable interaction\ndensities involving pl $s\\geq 1~$fields.\n\nSome of these nonrenormalizable pl interactions turn out to be\nrenormalizable in terms of $s\\geq 1~$covariant sl fields. This is in\nparticular the case if one allows higher order short distance compensations\nbetween couplings containing fields of different spins (reminiscent of\ncompensations between different spin components in supersymmetry\nmultiplets). Those which are not renormalizable in the sl sense are in all\nlikelihood not models of QFT. This points to an interesting connection\nbetween perturbative renormalizability and causal localization properties.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to illustrate these new ideas in their\nsimplest possible low order perturbative context. Technically more demanding\ntasks, as the elaboration of an $n^{th}$ order Epstein-Glaser\nrenormalization theory which includes causal string-crossings, will be left\nto future publications.\n\nQuantum gauge theory also achieves a reduction from $d_{sd}=2$ to $\\dot{d}\n_{sd}=1$ in case of $s=1,$ but it accomplishes this not with a Hilbert space\npositivity maintaining weakening of localization from pl to sl, but rather\nwith the help of indefinite metric which permits compensations in\nintermediate states between positive and negative contributions by brute\nforce. If it were not be for the existence of a subset of gauge invariant\noperators (which includes the S-matrix), an indefinite metric setting would\nremain without physical content.\n\nThe Hilbert space setting of QT is the basis of its probabilistic\ninterpretation. It has no counterpart in the classical theory and hence one\ncannot rely on \"quantization\" to solve conceptual problems of interactions\ninvolving $s=1~$fields. Quantum gauge theory is the result of keeping pl $\ns\\geq 1$ fields at the prize of sacrificing positivity. Gauge symmetry is a\nlocal symmetry in classical electromagnetism; it bears no relation to the\nprinciples of QFT but rather enters QFT through the \"quantization\"\nparallelism to classical field theory\\footnote{\nThere are however classical limits of pl or sl free quantum fields in terms\nof expectation values in coherent states.}. Perturbative QFT needs no\nreference to Lagrangian quantization; it can be defined in terms of\ninteraction densities formed from covariant pl or sl free fields which can\nbe directly obtained from Wigner's positive energy representation theory of\nthe Poincar\\'{e} group.\n\nPerturbative gauge invariance is a way to extend the pl formalism to $s=1$\ninteractions in a Krein space in order to extract those quantities which do\nnot \"feel\" the presence of negative metric states (namely the local\nobservables and the S-matrix). It has been \"an amazingly successful\nplaceholder\" (Stora) for an unknown Hilbert space formulation within the\nstandard setting of perturbative QFT. The new sl Hilbert space setting\nextends the Hilbert space Wightman formulation for interacting $s<1$ pl\nfields to $s\\geq 1~$sl fields for which the test-function smearing amounts\nto smearing in $x,$ using the smooth rapidly deceasing test functions $f(x))$\n\\textit{and} smearing in $e,$ using smooth compact supported functions $h(e)$\nin the $d=1+2$ de Sitter space of spacelike directions $e,~e^{2}=-1$\n\\footnote{\nThe present experience with perturbation theory suggests that interacting\nWightman fields with $s\\geq 1$ exist only in the form of sl fields.}$.$ The\nmain purpose of the present work is to convince the reader that the\nbeginnings of a theory for which gauge theory is the placeholder already\nexist.\n\nThe idea of constructing string-localized fields in Hilbert space can be\ntraced back to the solution of the localization properties of Wigner's zero\nmass infinite spin representation class \\cite{BGL} \\cite{MSY} in terms of\nthe \\textit{modular localization theory} of algebraic QFT (a\nhistoric/philosophical view can be found in \\cite{SHPMP}). But, as it is\noften the case, the historic context which led to a new view of QFT may turn\nout to be less important for its use in actual problems; the construction of\nstring-local fields and their use in a new perturbative setting does not\nrequire knowledge about modular localization.\n\nA prior result from algebraic QFT (AQFT) which highlighted the \\textit{\nnaturalness of string-localization} was obtained by Buchholz and Fredenhagen\nin \\cite{Bu-Fr}. Their theorem was formulated and proven in the\noperator-algebraic setting; re-expressing its physical content in terms of\nquantum fields it states:\n\n\\textbf{Theorem: }\\textit{The field theoretic content of an asymptotically\ncomplete QFT with a mass gap and local observables can be fully accounted\nfor in terms of string-local covariant fields}$~\\Psi (x,e)$\\textit{\\\nlocalized on spacelike semi-lines}$~x+R_{+}e~e^{2}=-1.$\\textit{\\ Point-local\nobservable fields correspond to the special case of }$e$\\textit{-independent \n}$\\Psi ^{\\prime }s$. \\textit{QFT does not need fields with weaker than\nstringlike localization properties (as e.g. localization on spacelike\nhypersurfaces)}.\n\nThe Hilbert space of such a theory can be described as a Wigner-Fock Hilbert\nspace spanned by those particle states which the (LSZ or Haag-Ruelle)\nscattering theory associates asymptotically with the string-local fields.\nSince functional analytic and operator-algebraic tools are not available in\nindefinite metric Krein spaces, the gauge theoretic setting is strictly\nlimited to the combinatorial rules of finite order renormalized perturbation\ntheory whereas nonperturbative theorems (TCP, Spin\\&Statistics, scattering\ntheory,...) cannot be derived. On the other hand most mathematical tools of\n(Wightman) QFT\\ remain valid for string-local fields; hence large parts of\ntextbook presentation of nonperturbative QFT can be adjusted to the new\nsituation.\n\nMore specific results come from the new perturbation theory of sl fields.\nWhereas positivity-preserving renormalizable interactions between\npoint-local fields are limited to low spins $s<1,$ renormalizable\ninteractions containing $s\\geq 1$ fields in a Hilbert space setting require\na weakening of localization from point- to string-local fields \\cite{Rio} \n\\cite{vector}. Couplings which even remain nonrenormalizable in a\nstring-local setting are not expected to represent models of QFT.\n\nThe a priory knowledge that the Hilbert space in models with a mass gap can\nbe identified with a Wigner-Fock particle space turns out to be very useful\nin the perturbative construction\\footnote{\nIt is important that this Fock spaces refers to asymptotic fields\n(particles); the use of a Fock space at finite times is forbidden by \"Haag's\ntheorem\" \\cite{Haag}.}. This well understood situation is also a good\nstarting point for investigating massless limits in which the standard\nWigner particle structure is lost (which manifests itself in terms of\ninfrared divergencies) and the appropriate Hilbert space has to be\nconstructed from the massless limit of the massive correlation functions \n\\cite{St-Wi}. Most deep unsolved problems of QFT, in particular a spacetime\nunderstanding of infrared properties which account for the conceptual\nchanges of large time scattering properties in QED and are responsible for\nconfinement in QCD, are connected with interactions involving massless\nvector potentials. Already for free fields the massless field is most\nconveniently constructed through the massless limit of the free massive sl\ncorrelation functions.\n\nIn view of the strong relation between causal localization and Hilbert space\npositivity one cannot expect that GT accounts for the correct causal\nlocalization properties. The absence of of positivity (unitarity) is not\nonly affecting issues of Hermitian adjoints and unitarity, but also spoils\nthe foundational causality property of QFT. The positivity and the ensuing\nstring-localization is particularly important for large distance properties\nwhich usually announce their presence through infrared divergencies. Long\ndistance problems do not occur in $s<1$ interactions; their physical\nunderstanding is inexorably related to properties of $s\\geq 1$ interacting\nsl fields. Although not yet established, one expects that the short distance\nasymptotic freedom behavior of the gauge dependent matter fields will be\nconfirmed in the sl Hilbert space theory.\n\nThe role of sl fields will be illustrated in two problems. One problem, the\nso-called \"violation of Haag duality\", is closely related to the\nAharonov-Bohm effect. It shows that the use of Hilbert space string-local\nvector potentials in a Wilson loop leads to a topological effect which is\nabsent for gauge theoretic point-like potentials in Krein space and has\ngeneralizations to all massless $s\\geq 1$ fields. The somewhat \"eery\nfeelings\" about an apparent causality violation (which partially account for\nthe popularity of the A-B effect) can be traced back to the use of the\npoint-local potentials of gauge theory; they disappear once one uses instead\ntheir covariant string-local counter-part which perceive the difference\nbetween Haag suality and the more general Einstein causality.\n\nThe main problem posed by string-local fields is the construction of the\ncorrect first order interaction densities. It is well-known that the\nrequirement of PCB $d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4~$(the prerequisite for\nrenormalizability) only permits pl couplings between fields of low spin $s<1$\nwith $d_{sd}=1$ or $3/2~$(for $s=1/2$).~String-local fields, whose short\ndistance dimension is $d_{sd}=1$ for bosons (and $3/2$ for fermions \\textit{\nindependent of }$s),$ permit PCB couplings for any spin.\n\nBut, as already mentioned before, there exists an additional rather severe\nrestriction on sl interaction-densities which has no counterpart for\nrenormalizable interactions between $s<1$ pl fields. Most string-local\ninteractions within $d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4~$lead to a \\textit{total\ndelocalization in higher orders}, which removes them from the list of\npotential candidates for a QFT model. This restriction will be exemplified\nfor three models: couplings of massive string-local vector mesons to complex\nfields (massive QED), to Hermitian fields (the Higgs model) and self-coupled\nmassive vector mesons.\n\nThe presence of self-coupled massive vector mesons lead to a new phenomenon;\nit is the only known coupling for which the first order PCB does not imply\nrenormalizability; or to formulate it in a historical context: passing from\nthe 4-Fermi interaction to intermediate self-interacting massive vector\nmesons improves the short distance properties so that the coupling leads to\nfirst order PCB, but fails in second order. The culprit is a second order\n\"induced\" $d_{sd}=5$ self-coupling which can only be compensated by\nenlarging the first order coupling by a $A\\cdot AH$ coupling with a scalar\nHermitian $H$ field whose second order iteration contains a compensating $H$\n-independent term. Whereas the massive (scalar, spinor) vector mesons of QED\ndo not require the presence of a (or several) $H,~$the second order PCB of\nstring-local massive Y-M and QCD cannot be maintained without a compensating \n$H$-coupling$.~$\n\nThe combination of a shift in the complex field space of a massless scalar\nQED (SSB \"breaking of gauge symmetry\") and a subsequent reality adjustment\nby an operator gauge transformation (no counterpart in SSB) leads also to\nthe correct interaction density, but this \"Higgs mechanism\" bears no\nphysical relation with the intrinsic origin of the second order induced (not\npostulated !) Mexican hat potential of a $H$ self-interaction (section 4).\nA\\ \\ genuine physical SSB breaking on the other hand leaves its intrinsic\n(i.e. independent of by what prescription it was obtained) physical mark on\nthe final model and there is simply none. The identically conserved Maxwell\ncurrent $j_{\\mu }=\\partial ^{\\nu }F_{\\mu \\nu }~$of an abelian massive vector\nmeson leads to a screened (and not to spontaneously broken) charge \\cite\n{vector}. Interactions between Hermitian fields and massive vector mesons\nare (as their complex counterparts) fully accounted for by the BRST gauge\ninvariance of the S-matrix $\\mathfrak{s}S=0~$or its spacetime Hilbert space\ncounterpart namely the independence of $S$ on string directions $d_{e}S=0.$\n\nThe perturbative string-local field theory (SLFT) shares many \\textit{formal}\nsimilarities with gauge theory (GT). This is particularly evident if one\nformulates GT not in terms of Feynman rules but instead uses the so-called\ncausal gauge invariant operator setting (CGI) \\cite{Scharf}. The reason is\nthat gauge invariance must hold on-shell but is violated off-shell. This\nmakes it difficult to discuss properties as positivity (unitarity), whose\nvalidity in gauge theories is \\textit{limited to the on-shell restrictions}\nof correlation functions (i.e. the S-matrix). In the CGI operator\nformulation of the BRST gauge formalism \\cite{Scharf} \\cite{Aste} \\cite{BDSV}\nthe perturbative implementation is focussed on the construction on the\nS-operator which fulfills $\\mathfrak{s}S=0$ where $\\mathfrak{s}$ is the\nnilpotent BRST s-operation; in this way the construction of the\ngauge-invariant S-operator is separated from the construction of the less\ninteresting gauge dependent correlation functions.\n\nThe implementation of the string-independence of the S-matrix and the\nindependence of \"inner\" strings of correlation functions of string-local\nfields is achieved with the help of a differential form calculus on the $\nd=1+2~$de Sitter space of string directions. Unlike GT with its\ncohomological BRST formalism based on a nilpotent $\\mathfrak{s}$-operation,\nwhose physical range is restricted to local observables and the perturbative\nS-matrix, the SLFT is a full QFT which contains the important string-local\nphysical matter fields whose LSZ limits connect the causal localization\nprinciples implemented in terms of fields and their charge-carrying local\nequivalence classes with the observable world of individual particles just\nas in point-local Hilbert space QFTs. But the appearance of the $e$\n-dependence in going from on- to off-shell complicates the analytic\nconnection between scattering amplitudes and correlation functions.\n\nIt is interesting to use some hindsight from this new developments for\nlooking back at the origin of modern GT. In the 't Hooft-Veltman paper on\nthe renormalization of nonabelian gauge theory the important issue was the\nverification of the unitarity of the S-matrix (ignoring infrared problems).\nWhat they achieved with the help of lengthy \"by hand\" calculations was\nafterwards \"streamlined\" by adding formal tools. Starting with\nFaddeev-Popov, being enriched by Slavnov, the formal polishing finally\nreached its present perfection in the hands of Becchi, Rouet, Stora and\nTuytin. It would be impossible for scholars of QFT to derive the BRST gauge\nformalism from the principles of QFT; they remain useful inventions for\nextracting a physical subtheory (in particular the S-matrix) from an\nunphysical description in Krein space.\n\nThe SLFT Hilbert space setting contains only physical degrees of freedom.\nBut this conceptual economy leads to new and even somewhat surprising\nconcepts. The massive pl Proca field $A_{\\mu }^{P}(x)$ turns out to lead to\na \\textit{pair} of sl fields, a sl vector potential $A_{\\mu }(x,e)~$\\textit{\nand} an sl scalar field $\\phi (x,e)$. Both fields appear in the interaction,\nbut in the zero mass limit only the sl $A_{\\mu }~$survives$.$This has a\nsurprising analogy with the appearance of short range vector potentials in\nthe BCS theory of superconductivity. In this analogy the bosonic $\\phi $\nfield corresponds to the Cooper pairs. As the $\\phi $ field, the Cooper\npairs result from a reorganization of existing degrees of freedom.\n\nNeither in the many-body quantum mechanical description of BCS\nsuperconductivity which leads to London's short range vector potentials, nor\nfor the description of QFT interactions of massive abelian vector mesons\nwith matter one needs new (e.g. Higgs) degrees of freedom. The QFT\ncounterpart of the Cooper pair regrouping are the $\\phi $ fields; it will be\nshown that they are an indispensable epiphenomenon of interacting massive\nvector mesons in a Hilbert space. This clears the way for asking the\nquestion why one needs $H$-fields in the presence of self-interacting\nmassive vector mesons. The answer has already been given in \\cite{vector}\nand will receive additional attention in section 4.\n\nWhereas the SLFT Hilbert space formalism has many formal similarities with\nthe implementation of on-shell BRST gauge invariance (section 5) in the\noperator formulation of \"causal gauge invariance\" (CGI) of the University of\nZ\\\"{u}rich group published during the 90s \\cite{Scharf} \\cite{Aste}, its\nconceptual and calculational power reaches beyond when it comes to long\ndistance infrared problems which cannot be described in terms of an\nS-matrix. The correct analog of the long-range Coulomb interaction of\nquantum mechanics are the long distance properties of physical matter fields\ninteracting with massless sl vector potentials. In such cases the structure\nof a Wigner-Fock Hilbert space and an S-matrix acting in it breaks down and\nthe remaining objects from which the theory has to be reconstructed are the\nmassless limits of the sl correlation functions.\n\nThe next section presents the kinematics of SLFT i.e. relations between the\nstring-local free fields and their use in interaction densities for which\none does not need perturbative calculations. The third section addresses\nwhat the title of this paper promises. Some second order perturbative\nresults and their interpretation are presented in section 4; this section\nalso contains educated guesses about physical manifestations of infrared\nproperties. Section 5 presents formal analogies with the CGI operator\nformulation of the BRST formalism. The outlook contains comments about\nongoing calculations and conjectures about what one hopes to accomplish in\nthe future.\n\nMany of the ideas arose in extensive discussions over several years with\nJens Mund, but the responsibility for possible errors and less than perfect\npresentations rest on my shoulders.\n\n\\section{A Hilbert space alternative to local gauge theory, kinematical\naspects}\n\nMassive free spin $s\\geq 1$ fields are commonly described in terms of degree \n$s$ tensor potentials.

The result is that the operator representing a\nregularized magnetic flux through a surface $D~$does not change under\ndeformations of $D$ as long as its boundary $\\partial D~$stays the same.

The authors refer to such a situation as the \"breakdown of Haag\nduality\".\n\nRecall that Einstein causality states that two operators commute if their\nlocalization regions are spacelike separated. In terms of operator algebras\nthis means\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mathcal{A(O}) &\\subseteq &\\mathcal{A(O}^{\\prime })^{\\prime\n},~~Einstein~causality \\\\\n\\mathcal{A(O}) &=&\\mathcal{A(O}^{\\prime })^{\\prime },~~Haag~duality\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the dash on the region refers to the causal complement and that on the\noperator algebra to its commutant. Our intuitive understanding of causal\nlocalization is however in terms of Haag duality \\cite{Haag}; we expect that\nan operator which commutes with \\textit{all }algebras which are localized in\nthe causal complement of a region $\\mathcal{O}$ is really localized in $\n\\mathcal{O}~$ i.e. is a member of $\\mathcal{A(O})$.\n\nHaag duality holds for all algebras which are generated by \\textit{massive}\nfree fields and is believed to remain valid for observable subalgebras\nlocalized in multiply connected regions. But the properties of magnetic\nfluxes in QED show that Haag duality is broken for multiply connected\nsubalgebras generated by point-local $s\\geq 1~$massless field strengths ($\nF_{\\mu \\nu },R_{\\mu \\nu \\lambda \\kappa },..$). In other words there are\noperators in $\\mathcal{A(O}^{\\prime })^{\\prime }$ which do not belong to $\n\\mathcal{A(O})$ and the Wilson loop operator with its topological $e$\n-dependence is an example.$~$Interestingly these breakdowns of Haag duality\nhappen in theories in which the potentials are necessarily string-local.\n\nIn the gauge theoretic setting the point-local nature of vector-potentials\n\"feigns\" a localization on $\\partial D$ and in this way misses the breakdown\nof Haag duality. \\textit{The causal localization in gauge theories is not\nthe physical localization.} What is missing for the case at hand is a\nproperty of the integrand of a Wilson loop which indicates that the\nregularized loop operator has the same Haag-duality breaking property as the\nmagnetic flux operator.\n\nThe violation of Haag duality is basically a classical phenomenon.

The authors refer to such a situation as the \"breakdown of Haag\nduality\".\n\nRecall that Einstein causality states that two operators commute if their\nlocalization regions are spacelike separated.

Our intuitive understanding of causal\nlocalization is however in terms of Haag duality \\cite{Haag}; we expect that\nan operator which commutes with \\textit{all }algebras which are localized in\nthe causal complement of a region $\\mathcal{O}$ is really localized in $\n\\mathcal{O}~$ i.e. is a member of $\\mathcal{A(O})$.\n\nHaag duality holds for all algebras which are generated by \\textit{massive}\nfree fields and is believed to remain valid for observable subalgebras\nlocalized in multiply connected regions. But the properties of magnetic\nfluxes in QED show that Haag duality is broken for multiply connected\nsubalgebras generated by point-local $s\\geq 1~$massless field strengths ($\nF_{\\mu \\nu },R_{\\mu \\nu \\lambda \\kappa },..$). In other words there are\noperators in $\\mathcal{A(O}^{\\prime })^{\\prime }$ which do not belong to $\n\\mathcal{A(O})$ and the Wilson loop operator with its topological $e$\n-dependence is an example.$~$Interestingly these breakdowns of Haag duality\nhappen in theories in which the potentials are necessarily string-local.\n\nIn the gauge theoretic setting the point-local nature of vector-potentials\n\"feigns\" a localization on $\\partial D$ and in this way misses the breakdown\nof Haag duality. \\textit{The causal localization in gauge theories is not\nthe physical localization.} What is missing for the case at hand is a\nproperty of the integrand of a Wilson loop which indicates that the\nregularized loop operator has the same Haag-duality breaking property as the\nmagnetic flux operator.\n\nThe violation of Haag duality is basically a classical phenomenon.

Such anomaly terms\nwill be referred to as \\textit{induced} \\textit{interactions}. They\noriginate \\textit{from the implementation of the }$e$\\textit{-independence\nof the S-matrix} and hence they have no analog in $s<1$ point-local\ninteractions.\n\nThe calculation of the S-matrix requires only the calculation of $N.$ In\nthat case it is more convenient to use a weaker formulation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&&dL-\\partial ^{\\mu }Q_{\\mu }=0,~Q_{\\mu }:=d_{e}V_{\\mu }~  \\label{Q} \\\\\n&&dTLL^{\\prime }-\\partial ^{\\mu }TQ_{\\mu }L^{\\prime }-\\partial ^{\\prime \\mu\n}TLQ_{\\mu }^{\\prime }=0  \\notag\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAs will be seen later, this \"$Q$-formulation\" is closely related to the\nimplementation of the gauge invariant S-matrix in the $sS=0$ in the CGI BRST\nsetting.\n\nThe $V$-formalism, which leads to the definition of pointlocal interactions\ndensities (\\ref{indep}), turns out to be indispensable for the construction\nof interacting string-local fields. It permits to define higher order\npoint-local interaction densities in terms of the renormalizable\nstring-local formalism. Together with the formal relation between point- and\nstring-local matter fields (\\ref{psi}) it can be used for the perturbative\nconstruction of renormalized correlation functions of string-local fields.\nThe point-local higher order interaction densities (\\ref{indep}) play the\nrole of the $e$-independence of string-local field correlations from the $\ne^{\\prime }s$ of internal propagators. This construction of interacting\nstring-local fields has been initiated by Jens Mund and will be the subject\nof a forthcoming publication.\n\nAssuming that these string-local fields remain renormalizable (Wightman\nfields in $x$) in every order, the results of Jaffe \\cite{Jaffe} on the\nsingular nature of exponentials of scalar free fields suggest that $\\psi\n^{P}(x)=\\psi (x,e)e^{-ig\\phi }$ is a singular (not Wightman-localizable)\nfield in a well-defined theory. As previously mentioned it shares its bad\nshort distance properties (unbounded increase of $d_{sd}$ with the\nperturbative order) with that of the field in the point-local setting, but\nat least its singular behavior is not accompanied by a (with perturbative\norder) growing number of coupling parameters. The bad high enery behavior of\nthe off-shell vacuum expectation of the nonrenormalizable pl Hilbert space\nsetting remains, but the numerical coefficients of the worsening pl\ncounterterms do not introduce new parameters.\n\nIn this situation one expects that there are high energy on-shell\ncancellations which permit the scattering amplitudes of the singular pl\nfiels to be the same as those obtained from the renormalizable sl\ncorrelations.

That the classical\ncausality principles of Faraday, Maxwell and Einstein become such powerful\nin the context of Hilbert space positivity of interacting higher spin $s\\geq\n1$ quantum matter is truly surprising.\n\nA much richer second order induction occurs in the $gA\\cdot AH~$coupling of\nmassive vector mesons to a Hermitian matter field $H~$(\\ref{H})$.$ In this\ncase the requirement of second order $e$-independence (\\ref{indep}) of $S$\nfor the more involved first order $L,\\partial V$ leads to a larger number\n(no charge symmetry) of induced interactions which includes the $H^{4}$\nself-interaction and even requires the presence of a first order\nmodification by $H^{3}~$self-interactions. The sum of both contributions has\nthe form of a Mexican hat \\cite{vector} just as in the CGI setting in \\cite\n{Scharf}, where the numerical coefficients contain besides the coupling\nstrength $g~$also mass ratios of the two physical masses $m_{H},m.$\n\nThese\\textit{\\ induced} \"Mexican hat\" terms would also appear in the BRST\ngauge formalism but, as already mentioned before, in a diagrammatic Feynman\nformalism it is difficult to be aware of the differences between on- and\noff-shell properties. Implementing the on-shell BRST $\\mathfrak{s}$\n-invariance $\\mathfrak{s}S=0,$ or the $e$-independence $dS=0~$in the SLF\nHilbert space setting, it is impossible to overlook the \\textit{induction}\nof a Mexican hat like self-interaction or confuse it with an off-shell SSB\nmechanism; it is the massive vector meson which is in the driver's seat and\nnot the scalar matter coupled to it \\cite{Scharf}. Apart from the richer\nstructure of the induced Mexican hat potentials (related to the absence of\nthe charge selection rule for $H$-couplings), this is analog to the second\norder induction of the quadratic $A$-dependence\\footnote{\nThere is no reason to refer to the $\\partial \\rightarrow \\partial -ieA$\nclassical \\ gauge connection, the quadratic $A~$term results solely from the\nquantum principles of QFT..} in massive scalar QED. In both cases the only\nconserved current is the \"massive Maxwell current\" $j_{\\mu }^{Max}=\\partial\n^{\\nu }F_{\\mu \\nu }$ and its charge is always screened ($Q^{Max}=0$) and not\nspontaneously broken ($Q^{SSB}=\\infty $)~\\cite{vector} (and references\ntherein).\n\nIt is interesting to note that unitarity properties of tree graphs and a bit\nof common sense, ignoring classical gauge structures, led some authors \\cite\n{Tik} \\cite{Corn} to the correct result already in the early 70's; including\nthe idea that the Lie-algebraic structure of self-interacting vector-mesons\nmay be a natural property of self-interacting massive vectormesons and needs\nno imposition of gauge symmetry. If they had formulated their unitarity\nrequirements directly in terms of interactions of massive vector mesons with\nHermitian matter fields they would have noticed that there is no need to\ninvoke a SSB Higgs mechanism. Pushing a bit harder they could have seen that\nthe reason why massive QCD or just Y-M (as opposed to massive QED) requires\nthe presence of a $H$ coupling just in order to avoid violations of the\nsecond order PCB (and not for implementing SSB). The present work on\ninteractions of $s=1$ vector mesons in a Hilbert space setting can be seen\nas a field theoretic confirmation of these on-shell unitarity arguments\nwhich need neither the invocation of gauge symmetries nor that of SSB.\n\nIt is certainly true that the formalistic \"breaking of gauge invariance\" by\na shift in field space of scalar QED combined with an hermiticity-restoring\ngauge transformation\\ leads to the abelian Higgs model (what else could it\ndo?). \\textit{But this bears no relation to the intrinsic properties of the\nresulting model}.\n\nIn any renormalizable model the form of the local interaction density is\nuniquely determined in terms of the field content (including the physical\nmasses of the free fields) and the imposed internal symmetries.\nRenormalization theory leads to additional contributions in the form of\ncounter-terms with new coupling parameters. The new insight is that the\npreservation of Hilbert space positivity in the presence of $s=1\\ $\nvector-potentials leads to the phenomenon of \\textit{induced} interactions;\nin contrast to the free parameters of counter-terms (which are only subject\nto the imposed inner symmetries), \\textit{induced contributions do not\nenlarge the number of free parameters}. In particular the numerical\ncoefficients of the induced Mexican hat potential are determined in terms of\nthe $A\\cdot AH$ coupling strength $g$ and the two masses $m,m_{H}.$\n\nSSB in the sense of Goldstone ($\\partial ^{\\mu }j_{\\mu }=0\\,\\ $but $Q=\\infty \n$) requires an \\textit{interaction density which contains massive as well as\nmassless scalar free fields in a precisely tuned proportion}. A helpful way\nto obtain such a situation is to start from the conserved current of a\nsymmetrically coupled self-interacting scalar multiplet with a symmetric\nmass term of the opposite sign (so the potential takes the form of a Mexican\nhat). It is well known that a suitable shift in field space brings the\nminimum back to the value zero. One then checks that this shift\nmanipulations changes the form of the field equation but the conservation of\nthe current (which uses the field equation) remains intact. The new field\nequations contain mass terms which depend on the choice of the direction of\nthe field shift in the multi-component field space, but there always will be\nsome zero mass particles (the Goldstone bosons).\n\nAfter the semiclassical preparation of the model, QFT (in the form of\nrenormalized perturbation theory) takes over. It maintains the physical\nmasses of the interaction density defining free fields and the conservation\nof the current in every order of perturbation theory. Some of the integrals\ndefining the conserved charges (the would be global symmetry generators) are\nprevented from converging by long range manifestation of the Goldstone\nbosons. This (and not the quasiclassical manipulations to obtain such a QFT)\nis the \\textit{definition of SSB} (the non-invertibility of the Noether\ntheorem i.e. $\\partial j=0$ but $Q=\\int j_{0}=\\infty $). An alternative more\ngeneral picture is to say that there are \"partial\" charges localized in a\ncausally closed spacetime regions whose exponentiated unitary symmetry\noperators implement the full symmetries on observables in a smaller\nspacetime region. Some of these partial charges fail to be extendible to\ncharges which implement global unitary symmetries. For a model-independent\nstructural theorem about SSB see \\cite{E-S}.\n\n\\textit{QFT is not a theory which says anything about the masses of\nelementary free fields} which enter the definition of a model. Masses of\nbound states interpolated by composite fields on the other hand are expected\nto be computable (although there is no known consistent perturbative method\nto implement this. The terminology \"SSB creation of masses\" is still within\nthe range of tolerable metaphors of particle physics. The danger of\nmisunderstandings starts if these manipulations are applied outside their\nrange of validity.\n\nAs explained previously for interactions involving higher spin fields there\nare restrictions (gauge invariance, directional independence of $S$) which\nlead to the induction of $H~$selfinteraction. Starting from $A\\cdot AH~$\ninteractions between a massive vector meson and a Hermitian field one\nobtains the same Higgs models as from the SSB Higgs mechanism which starts\nfrom a massless gauge theory of a complex field. Which is the correct\nderivation i.e. the derivation which is consistent with the physical\nprinciples? The answer is that the one based on the gauge invariance of the\nS-matrix or even better on $e$-independence of $S$ is consistent with QFT\nprinciples. The reason is obvious since SSB, even there where it is\nmeaningful is an option whereas gauge invariance or the properties of SLFT\nare part of the conceptual structure of interacting massive vector mesons.\n\nQFT is a foundational quantum theory which reveals its intrinsic properties\nindependent of by what computational tricks or thoughts the acting physicist\nobtained a model. In case of SSB the integral over the charge density of the\nconserved current diverges (the definition of SSB) and in models involving\nmassive vector mesons the charge is \"screened\" i.e. the $Q$ vanishes. This\nis obviously a generic property of an identically conserved Maxwell current $\nj_{\\mu }=\\partial ^{\\nu }F_{\\mu \\nu }$ \\cite{vector}. One should not allow\nto confuse such opposite situations by metaphors as: \"photons fattened by\neating Goldstones\".\n\nOne obtains a better understanding of the history of the Higgs model when\none recalls that QED resulted from a natural adaptation of the classical\nMaxwell's theory to the requirements of charge-carrying (complex) quantum\nmatter. That classical theory contains however no suggestion of how to\ncouple vector potentials to \\textit{Hermitian} matter. As we know nowadays\nsuch couplings vanish in the limit $m\\rightarrow 0$ i.e. they only exist in\nthe presence of massive vector mesons. Therefore the SSB prescription of a\nshift in field space was a helpful formal device to become aware of a new\ncoupling to Hermitian matter which disappears in the Maxwell limit. The\nproblem started when this prescription was misinterpreted as a physical SSB\nof gauge symmetry which \"creates\" masses. This does not only reveal a\nmisunderstanding of the role of the quantum gauge formalism (a method to\nrecover physical properties from an unphysical Krein space setting), but\nalso of SSB (a conserved current with a \\textit{diverging} charge).\n\nHowever in \\textit{massive} \\textit{QCD} or just massive \\textit{Y-M} one \n\\textit{really needs a coupling to a }$H$\\textit{-field,} so the important\nremaining problem (the most important of the entire section) is to\nunderstand why for self-interacting massive vectormesons the consistency of\nthe model requires the presence of $H^{\\prime }s,~$whereas in massive\n(spinor or scalar) QED they play no role.\n\nGT and the Hilbert space based SLFT lead to the same answer to this\nquestion, though the details of the second order calculations are somewhat\ndifferent. The gauge theoretic requirement $\\mathfrak{s}S=0$ \\cite{Scharf},$\n~ $as well as the $dS=0$ formalism derived from first principles of QFT\ninduce nonrenormalizable second order self-interactions of $d_{sd}=5.$ \n\\textit{This is the only known case in which a first order interaction\nwithin the power-counting restriction }$d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4\\,\\ $\\textit{turns\nnonrenormalizable in second order! }When in the old days the 4-Fermion model\nof weak interactions was replaced by the short-distance improved\nintermediate massive vector meson model in the setting of massive nonabelian\ngauge theory, it was at first overlooked that this model fails to preserve\nsecond order renormalizability. Hence the massive vector meson exchange\nconverted Fermi's 4-Fermi coupling first-order PCB whereas the second order\ncompensation with $A$-$H$ interactions maintains this in second order.\n\nThe compensatory mechanism is reminiscent of compensations of short distance\nsingularities between contributions from different spins in supermultiplets.\nThe compensating field coupled to the self-interacting massive vector mesons\nshould have a lower spin (a higher spin would make sense worse) and the same\nHermiticity properties as the $A_{\\mu }$, hence it must be a $H$-field.\n\nIt turns out that the only way to preserve the second order power-counting\nrestriction is to \\textit{enlarge the first order }$A$\\textit{\n~self-interaction by a nonabelian }$A\\cdot AH$\\textit{\\ coupling\\footnote{\nThe short distance compensation does nit fix the number of $H^{\\prime }s.$\nIn case of one $H$ (which seems to be favored by LHC) the coupling is unique.\n}}. Its second order contribution contains in addition to those term\nexpected from the analogy with the abelian model an additional $d_{sd}=5$\ncontribution which can be used to compensate the incriminated\nnonrenormalizable term from the self-interaction. The net result is that,\napart from the induced Mexican hat potential, all non-compensating anomaly\ncontributions can be absorbed into modified time-ordered products\n(propagators) $T_{0}\\rightarrow T\\,.~$There is no physical role for the $H$\nfield to play in the understanding of massive abelian gauge theories, but\ntheir compensatory role in the presence of \\textit{self-interacting} massive\nvectormesons is indispensable.\n\nThis preservation of renormalizability by short distance compensations is\nreminiscent of cancellations between different spins contributions in\nsupersymmetric interactions. The difficulty that one does not know how to\nformulate a supersymmetry-preserving renormalization theory is absent in\ncase of gauge invariance or $e$-independence. The formal manipulations\nwithin a \"Higgs mechanism\" give the complete interaction in one swoop but\nfail to realize that behind the scene there is a new type of compensation\nbetween different spin contributions which different from those of\nsupersymmetry. For the GT presentation of this compensation the reader\nshould consult \\cite{Scharf}, some remarks about its SLFT derivation can be\nfound in \\cite{vector} and the details will be contained in joint work with\nJens Mund.\n\nThe reason why it could be important to understand the correct physical\ncause for the presence of the $H$ (apart from the fact that in a\nfoundational theory as QFT it is always good to know the intrinsic reasons\nfor a new phenomenon) is that the construction of $L,V_{\\mu }$ pairs may\nlead to compensatory situations involving higher spin fields as $g_{\\mu \\nu\n}(x,e)~$together with compensatory $s=1$ and $s=0$ contributions. It would\nnot be necessary that $V_{\\mu }$ has $d_{sd}\\leq 4~$as long as the higher\nshort distance dimensions compensate in higher orders.\n\nIn the Higgs paper \\cite{Higgs} one finds the remark that the $H$-field is\nneeded to generate a mass. In this context there are references to works in\ncondensed matter physics as the phenomenological Landau-Ginsberg description\nof superconductivity and its microscopic BCS refinement (also Anderson's\nwork on energy gaps from a gap-less situation). In all those works already \n\\textit{existing degrees of freedom regroup themselves} (the Cooper pairs)\nand in this way lead to new physical manifestations. But this is precisely\nthe mechanism by which the Hilbert space description of \\textit{massive} QED\nrequires the introduction of a scalar string-local field $\\phi $ (the $\nA_{\\mu }^{\\prime }s$ \"escort\") which depends on the same degrees of freedom\n(namely the $s=1$ Wigner creation/annihilation operators) as the massive\nvector potential.\n\nAs the BCS superconductivity cannot be described without the regroupment of\ncondensed matter degrees of freedom in the form of Cooper pairs, massive QED\nin a Hilbert space setting needs the presence of the (degrees of freedom\nmaintaining) escort field $\\phi .~$Gauge theory in Krein space is a physical\nincomplete theory (no physical substitute for gauge-dependent fields) which\nhas many additional unphysical degrees of freedom (negative metric fields,\nghost fields) but no physical $\\phi $-field. The degree of freedom issue and\nthe appearance of additional fields is a quantum phenomenon which has no\nclassical counterpart. Whereas the perturbative structure of $s<1$ QFT\nmaintains formal relations to classical FT, these links are lost in the\npresence of $s\\geq 1$ fields.\n\nPrecisely for this reason it is important to understand the physical cause \n\\textit{why additional }$H$\\textit{-degrees of freedom are needed in the\npresence of self-interacting massive vector mesons}. It turns out that the\nfirst order modification of the 4-Fermi interaction by intermediate massive\nvector mesons leading a nonabelian massive gauge theory only secured the\nfirst order PCB but that the second order leads to a\nrenormalizability-violating $d_{sd}=5~$term. Since in all previous studied\nmodels of QFT the first order PCB bound $d_{sd}\\leq 4$ always implied\nrenormalizability\\footnote{\nHigher order short distance compensation between fields of different spin\nare only expected in SUSY QFTs.}, this phenomenon was overlooked. The\ninterpretation of the nonabelian Higgs model as resulting from a SSB\nbreaking of gauge invariance obscured this problem since the \\textit{physical\n} understanding of a second order short distance compensation mechanism\ncannot be delegated to formal description of a model as arising from SSB of\ngauge symmetry (a physical symmetry ?). In the more physical SLFT Hilbert\nspace setting for $s=1~$interactions there is no gauge symmetry, so what is\nthe S to which the SSB prescription should be applied ?\n\nOne rather has to realize that the coupling of $H$ fields to massive vector\nmesons defines autonomous theories and that the $H$-selfineractions (the\nMexican hat potential) is \"induced\" and not the result of an imposed SSB.\nThe induction phenomenon, which was explained in the beginning of this\nsection, does not exist for point-local $s<1$ interactions but is\ncharacteristic for interactions involving string-local $s\\geq 1$ fields.\nAnother phenomenon which appears only for $s\\geq 1$ is that a massive model\nwithin first order PCB may violate second order PCB. In such a case one has\nto look for an extension of the model by adding an interaction with an\nadditional field which leads to a second order compensation of the\nrenormalizability threatening second order terms. Precisely this happens for\nself-interacting massive vector mesons in which the compensating fields are $\nH$ fields; this, and not the alleged role of a mass creating midwife, is the\nfoundational purpose of the $H.$\n\nAs far as the classification of all second order compensation of\nself-interacting massive vector mesons of different masses couples with $H$\n-multiplets with different mass is concerned the recipe based on SSB\nbreaking schemes turns out to be quite efficient because the SSB formalism\nleads to the same family of models as the classification of compensations \n\\cite{BDSV}. Nature does not follow the logic of ostensible simplicity of\ncalculational prescriptions of particle theorists but rather sticks to her\nown principles. The relation of pertubative renormalizability with causal\nlocalization in a Hilbert space setting is certainly one of her deep but\nstill insufficiently understood conceptual messages.\n\nThat important discoveries have been made by less than correct reasons is\nnot new; even Dirac's argument in favor of anti-particles was based on the\ninconsistent hole theory. For the experimental discovery of the Higgs\nparticle this made no difference; one may even speculate that the somewhat\nmysterious appeal of the SSB explanation (creating the masses of all\nparticles, including its own) may have been a more important motivating\nforce for the enormous mental and material effort which went into its\ndiscovery at LHC than the preservation of second order renormalizability\n(which to many particle physicists may appear as a d\\`{e}j\\'{a} vu of the\n4-Fermi past).\n\nWhat is a bit worrisome (as compared to the history of antiparticles and\nother important discoveries originally made for less than correct reasons)\nis that the SSB Higgs mechanism still dominates the scene after 4 decades.\nThis raises the question whether explanations which found acceptance within\na globalized community (apart from the tiny group of scholars who noticed\nconceptual inconsistencies) can be still be corrected in times of \"Big\nScience\". In any case the main purpose of the present work is not to address\nsociological problems but rather the presentation of a surprising new look\nat one of QFT's oldest problems: how to formulate $s\\geq 1$ interactions in\na quantum theoretical Hilbert space setting.\n\nThis includes in particular problems involving massless vector potentials.\nThe perturbative infrared divergencies for scattering of electric\ncharge-carrying particles signal the breakdown of the spacetime\nunderstanding of the field-particle relation in terms of (LSZ, Haag-Ruelle)\nscattering theory. Successful momentum space recipes (the Bloch-Nordsieck\nprescription and its Yennie-Frautschi-Suura refinement \\cite{YFS}) for\nphoton-inclusive cross sections cannot hide the fact that GT, as a result of\nabsence of charge-carrying matter fields, is not able to solve this problem.\n\nOne expects that the new SLFT theory sheds new light on this age-old\nproblem. After all passing form point-local fields in GT to covariant\nstring-local interacting fields is not the result of a playful attitude to\ntry out something else (as in ST), but rather the inevitable consequence of\nupholding one of quantum theory's most cherished principles: the positivity\nof the Hilbert space.\n\nThe correct analog of quantum mechanical long-range Coulomb potentials are\nstring-local charge-carrying matter fields. The associated particles are\nstill registered in compact localized counters; the only influence of\nnoncompact field localization on particle counting events are spread over a\nlarger spacetime region. As previously mentioned there exist rigorous\nresults based on the quantum Gauss law which show the noncompactness of\ncharge localization and the \"stiffness\" of string-local charge-carrying\nstates whose directions (different from that of their massive counterparts)\ncause a spontaneous breaking of Lorentz-invariance \\cite{Bu} \\cite{Froe} and\nleads to a radical structural change of the Fock space (see end of previous\nsection).\n\nThe only objects which remain relatively unaffected by the structural\nchanges in the massless limit are the expectation values of string-local\nfields. Their calculation in the massive case requires the use of the\npoint-local interaction densities $(TL..L)^{P}$ (\\ref{indep}) as well as the\nrelation (\\ref{psi}) between point- and string-local matter fields. The\nextension of the on-shell S-matrix formalism to off-shell string-local\nfields is an ambitious program which has been initiated by Jens Mund. One\nexpects that its leads to both renormalizable (Wightman-localizable)\nstring-local and singular (Jaffe class) point-local matter fields. Only the\nstring-local correlations are expected to possess a massless limit; they\naccount for the properties of the \"rigid\" (SSB L-invariance-breaking)\nelectric charge-carrying strings.\n\nThe QED Hilbert space and the string-local operators acting in it are then\ndetermined in terms of Wightman's reconstruction theorem \\cite{St-Wi}. They\nshould provide the spacetime explanation for the change of the electron\nmass-shell into a milder cut-like singularity and the momentum space recipes\nwhich replace the vanishing scattering amplitudes of charge-carrying\nparticles by the recipe for photon-inclusive cross sections.\n\nA more radical behavior is expected in the massless limit of\nself-interacting vector mesons. The conjectured confinement means that only\ncorrelations which contain solely point-local hadron and gluonium composites\nas well as \"string-bridged\" $q-\\bar{q}$ pairs will survive this limit\nwhereas correlation containing string-local gluon or quark fields vanish.\nFrom the analogy with the vanishing QED scattering amplitudes for\nelectrically charged particles with a finite number of participating photons\none expects that there will be logarithmic infrared divergencies in the\npresence of gluon or quark operators whose summation of leading perturbative\ncontributions for $m<<1$ will lead to functions which vanish in the massless\nlimit.\n\nBut does this conjecture have a chance to be confirmed by perturbative\ncalculations? Certainly not in GT, since off-shell correlation functions in\ncovariant gauges are known to remain infrared finite \\cite{Hollands}. But\nthe directional fluctuations of string-local fields have stronger infrared\nramifications than the point-local fields in covariant gauges of GT. They\nare expected to be especially strong in the presence of self-interacting\nvector potentials. The lowest order candidate for testing the possible\npresence of an off-shell logarithmic divergence for $m\\rightarrow 0~$would\nbe the $e$-dependent second order $F$-$F~$propagator. The off-shell\nperturbation theory for string-local fields is presently under construction.\n\n\\section{Gauge theory and local quantum physics}\n\nDespite significant conceptual differences between GT and SLFT there are\nalso formal analogies. A comparison between these two ways of describing QFT\nof $s=1$ fields leads to a better understanding of their mutual relation. In\nthe absence of interactions the differences only affects a fine point in the\ninterpretation of causality in gauge invariant Wilson loops (section 3), but\nthey increase in the presence of interactions. The construction of the\nglobally gauge invariant S-matrix is a good illustration.\n\nThe CGI BRST operator formalism handles this problem in the following way.\nInstead of (\\ref{lin}) one writes \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 80117, "prevtext": "\nFor more details we refer to \\cite{vector}.\n\nThis is similar to gauge theory where it results from BRST gauge invariance\nof the S-matrix\\footnote{\nIn the naive formulation the quadratic term arises from the replacement of $\n\\partial \\rightarrow \\partial -igA$ in order to preserve gauge invariance of\nthe classical Lagrangian.} $\\mathfrak{s}S=0,~$except that the independence\nof the S-matrix from string directions is a natural physical consequence of\nlarge time scattering theory \\cite{Bu-Fr} for string-local fields in the\npresence of a mass-gap.

An understanding of QED within the principles of QFT (causal\nlocalization of fields in a Hilbert space) is still missing.\n\nWhereas the application of the SLFT Hilbert space formalism is still in its\ninitial stages, the CGI gauge approach exists since the early 90s \\cite\n{Scharf} (see \\cite{BDSV} for a recent account).

Any attempt to interpret the independently\nfluctuating $e^{\\prime }s$ as gauge parameters by equating them in\ncontributions from different fields causes the renormalization-resistent\ninfinities of the abandoned axial gauge formalism to return with full\nvengeance.\n\nIt is important to notice that the second order $A\\cdot A\\varphi ^{\\ast\n}\\varphi ~$contribution is induced by the principles of QFT (causal\nlocalization in Hilbert space), there is no reference to a classical gauge\nstructure. This is even more remarkable in models of self-interacting vector\nmesons in which the Lie-algebra structure, unlike classical gauge theory,\nbears no relation to an imposed symmetry but rather results from only\nimplementing the spacetime causality principles. That the classical\ncausality principles of Faraday, Maxwell and Einstein become such powerful\nin the context of Hilbert space positivity of interacting higher spin $s\\geq\n1$ quantum matter is truly surprising.\n\nA much richer second order induction occurs in the $gA\\cdot AH~$coupling of\nmassive vector mesons to a Hermitian matter field $H~$(\\ref{H})$.$ In this\ncase the requirement of second order $e$-independence (\\ref{indep}) of $S$\nfor the more involved first order $L,\\partial V$ leads to a larger number\n(no charge symmetry) of induced interactions which includes the $H^{4}$\nself-interaction and even requires the presence of a first order\nmodification by $H^{3}~$self-interactions. The sum of both contributions has\nthe form of a Mexican hat \\cite{vector} just as in the CGI setting in \\cite\n{Scharf}, where the numerical coefficients contain besides the coupling\nstrength $g~$also mass ratios of the two physical masses $m_{H},m.$\n\nThese\\textit{\\ induced} \"Mexican hat\" terms would also appear in the BRST\ngauge formalism but, as already mentioned before, in a diagrammatic Feynman\nformalism it is difficult to be aware of the differences between on- and\noff-shell properties. Implementing the on-shell BRST $\\mathfrak{s}$\n-invariance $\\mathfrak{s}S=0,$ or the $e$-independence $dS=0~$in the SLF\nHilbert space setting, it is impossible to overlook the \\textit{induction}\nof a Mexican hat like self-interaction or confuse it with an off-shell SSB\nmechanism; it is the massive vector meson which is in the driver's seat and\nnot the scalar matter coupled to it \\cite{Scharf}. Apart from the richer\nstructure of the induced Mexican hat potentials (related to the absence of\nthe charge selection rule for $H$-couplings), this is analog to the second\norder induction of the quadratic $A$-dependence\\footnote{\nThere is no reason to refer to the $\\partial \\rightarrow \\partial -ieA$\nclassical \\ gauge connection, the quadratic $A~$term results solely from the\nquantum principles of QFT..} in massive scalar QED. In both cases the only\nconserved current is the \"massive Maxwell current\" $j_{\\mu }^{Max}=\\partial\n^{\\nu }F_{\\mu \\nu }$ and its charge is always screened ($Q^{Max}=0$) and not\nspontaneously broken ($Q^{SSB}=\\infty $)~\\cite{vector} (and references\ntherein).\n\nIt is interesting to note that unitarity properties of tree graphs and a bit\nof common sense, ignoring classical gauge structures, led some authors \\cite\n{Tik} \\cite{Corn} to the correct result already in the early 70's; including\nthe idea that the Lie-algebraic structure of self-interacting vector-mesons\nmay be a natural property of self-interacting massive vectormesons and needs\nno imposition of gauge symmetry. If they had formulated their unitarity\nrequirements directly in terms of interactions of massive vector mesons with\nHermitian matter fields they would have noticed that there is no need to\ninvoke a SSB Higgs mechanism. Pushing a bit harder they could have seen that\nthe reason why massive QCD or just Y-M (as opposed to massive QED) requires\nthe presence of a $H$ coupling just in order to avoid violations of the\nsecond order PCB (and not for implementing SSB). The present work on\ninteractions of $s=1$ vector mesons in a Hilbert space setting can be seen\nas a field theoretic confirmation of these on-shell unitarity arguments\nwhich need neither the invocation of gauge symmetries nor that of SSB.\n\nIt is certainly true that the formalistic \"breaking of gauge invariance\" by\na shift in field space of scalar QED combined with an hermiticity-restoring\ngauge transformation\\ leads to the abelian Higgs model (what else could it\ndo?). \\textit{But this bears no relation to the intrinsic properties of the\nresulting model}.\n\nIn any renormalizable model the form of the local interaction density is\nuniquely determined in terms of the field content (including the physical\nmasses of the free fields) and the imposed internal symmetries.\nRenormalization theory leads to additional contributions in the form of\ncounter-terms with new coupling parameters. The new insight is that the\npreservation of Hilbert space positivity in the presence of $s=1\\ $\nvector-potentials leads to the phenomenon of \\textit{induced} interactions;\nin contrast to the free parameters of counter-terms (which are only subject\nto the imposed inner symmetries), \\textit{induced contributions do not\nenlarge the number of free parameters}. In particular the numerical\ncoefficients of the induced Mexican hat potential are determined in terms of\nthe $A\\cdot AH$ coupling strength $g$ and the two masses $m,m_{H}.$\n\nSSB in the sense of Goldstone ($\\partial ^{\\mu }j_{\\mu }=0\\,\\ $but $Q=\\infty \n$) requires an \\textit{interaction density which contains massive as well as\nmassless scalar free fields in a precisely tuned proportion}. A helpful way\nto obtain such a situation is to start from the conserved current of a\nsymmetrically coupled self-interacting scalar multiplet with a symmetric\nmass term of the opposite sign (so the potential takes the form of a Mexican\nhat). It is well known that a suitable shift in field space brings the\nminimum back to the value zero. One then checks that this shift\nmanipulations changes the form of the field equation but the conservation of\nthe current (which uses the field equation) remains intact. The new field\nequations contain mass terms which depend on the choice of the direction of\nthe field shift in the multi-component field space, but there always will be\nsome zero mass particles (the Goldstone bosons).\n\nAfter the semiclassical preparation of the model, QFT (in the form of\nrenormalized perturbation theory) takes over. It maintains the physical\nmasses of the interaction density defining free fields and the conservation\nof the current in every order of perturbation theory. Some of the integrals\ndefining the conserved charges (the would be global symmetry generators) are\nprevented from converging by long range manifestation of the Goldstone\nbosons. This (and not the quasiclassical manipulations to obtain such a QFT)\nis the \\textit{definition of SSB} (the non-invertibility of the Noether\ntheorem i.e. $\\partial j=0$ but $Q=\\int j_{0}=\\infty $). An alternative more\ngeneral picture is to say that there are \"partial\" charges localized in a\ncausally closed spacetime regions whose exponentiated unitary symmetry\noperators implement the full symmetries on observables in a smaller\nspacetime region. Some of these partial charges fail to be extendible to\ncharges which implement global unitary symmetries. For a model-independent\nstructural theorem about SSB see \\cite{E-S}.\n\n\\textit{QFT is not a theory which says anything about the masses of\nelementary free fields} which enter the definition of a model. Masses of\nbound states interpolated by composite fields on the other hand are expected\nto be computable (although there is no known consistent perturbative method\nto implement this. The terminology \"SSB creation of masses\" is still within\nthe range of tolerable metaphors of particle physics. The danger of\nmisunderstandings starts if these manipulations are applied outside their\nrange of validity.\n\nAs explained previously for interactions involving higher spin fields there\nare restrictions (gauge invariance, directional independence of $S$) which\nlead to the induction of $H~$selfinteraction. Starting from $A\\cdot AH~$\ninteractions between a massive vector meson and a Hermitian field one\nobtains the same Higgs models as from the SSB Higgs mechanism which starts\nfrom a massless gauge theory of a complex field. Which is the correct\nderivation i.e. the derivation which is consistent with the physical\nprinciples? The answer is that the one based on the gauge invariance of the\nS-matrix or even better on $e$-independence of $S$ is consistent with QFT\nprinciples. The reason is obvious since SSB, even there where it is\nmeaningful is an option whereas gauge invariance or the properties of SLFT\nare part of the conceptual structure of interacting massive vector mesons.\n\nQFT is a foundational quantum theory which reveals its intrinsic properties\nindependent of by what computational tricks or thoughts the acting physicist\nobtained a model. In case of SSB the integral over the charge density of the\nconserved current diverges (the definition of SSB) and in models involving\nmassive vector mesons the charge is \"screened\" i.e. the $Q$ vanishes. This\nis obviously a generic property of an identically conserved Maxwell current $\nj_{\\mu }=\\partial ^{\\nu }F_{\\mu \\nu }$ \\cite{vector}. One should not allow\nto confuse such opposite situations by metaphors as: \"photons fattened by\neating Goldstones\".\n\nOne obtains a better understanding of the history of the Higgs model when\none recalls that QED resulted from a natural adaptation of the classical\nMaxwell's theory to the requirements of charge-carrying (complex) quantum\nmatter. That classical theory contains however no suggestion of how to\ncouple vector potentials to \\textit{Hermitian} matter. As we know nowadays\nsuch couplings vanish in the limit $m\\rightarrow 0$ i.e. they only exist in\nthe presence of massive vector mesons. Therefore the SSB prescription of a\nshift in field space was a helpful formal device to become aware of a new\ncoupling to Hermitian matter which disappears in the Maxwell limit. The\nproblem started when this prescription was misinterpreted as a physical SSB\nof gauge symmetry which \"creates\" masses. This does not only reveal a\nmisunderstanding of the role of the quantum gauge formalism (a method to\nrecover physical properties from an unphysical Krein space setting), but\nalso of SSB (a conserved current with a \\textit{diverging} charge).\n\nHowever in \\textit{massive} \\textit{QCD} or just massive \\textit{Y-M} one \n\\textit{really needs a coupling to a }$H$\\textit{-field,} so the important\nremaining problem (the most important of the entire section) is to\nunderstand why for self-interacting massive vectormesons the consistency of\nthe model requires the presence of $H^{\\prime }s,~$whereas in massive\n(spinor or scalar) QED they play no role.\n\nGT and the Hilbert space based SLFT lead to the same answer to this\nquestion, though the details of the second order calculations are somewhat\ndifferent. The gauge theoretic requirement $\\mathfrak{s}S=0$ \\cite{Scharf},$\n~ $as well as the $dS=0$ formalism derived from first principles of QFT\ninduce nonrenormalizable second order self-interactions of $d_{sd}=5.$ \n\\textit{This is the only known case in which a first order interaction\nwithin the power-counting restriction }$d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4\\,\\ $\\textit{turns\nnonrenormalizable in second order! }When in the old days the 4-Fermion model\nof weak interactions was replaced by the short-distance improved\nintermediate massive vector meson model in the setting of massive nonabelian\ngauge theory, it was at first overlooked that this model fails to preserve\nsecond order renormalizability. Hence the massive vector meson exchange\nconverted Fermi's 4-Fermi coupling first-order PCB whereas the second order\ncompensation with $A$-$H$ interactions maintains this in second order.\n\nThe compensatory mechanism is reminiscent of compensations of short distance\nsingularities between contributions from different spins in supermultiplets.\nThe compensating field coupled to the self-interacting massive vector mesons\nshould have a lower spin (a higher spin would make sense worse) and the same\nHermiticity properties as the $A_{\\mu }$, hence it must be a $H$-field.\n\nIt turns out that the only way to preserve the second order power-counting\nrestriction is to \\textit{enlarge the first order }$A$\\textit{\n~self-interaction by a nonabelian }$A\\cdot AH$\\textit{\\ coupling\\footnote{\nThe short distance compensation does nit fix the number of $H^{\\prime }s.$\nIn case of one $H$ (which seems to be favored by LHC) the coupling is unique.\n}}. Its second order contribution contains in addition to those term\nexpected from the analogy with the abelian model an additional $d_{sd}=5$\ncontribution which can be used to compensate the incriminated\nnonrenormalizable term from the self-interaction. The net result is that,\napart from the induced Mexican hat potential, all non-compensating anomaly\ncontributions can be absorbed into modified time-ordered products\n(propagators) $T_{0}\\rightarrow T\\,.~$There is no physical role for the $H$\nfield to play in the understanding of massive abelian gauge theories, but\ntheir compensatory role in the presence of \\textit{self-interacting} massive\nvectormesons is indispensable.\n\nThis preservation of renormalizability by short distance compensations is\nreminiscent of cancellations between different spins contributions in\nsupersymmetric interactions. The difficulty that one does not know how to\nformulate a supersymmetry-preserving renormalization theory is absent in\ncase of gauge invariance or $e$-independence. The formal manipulations\nwithin a \"Higgs mechanism\" give the complete interaction in one swoop but\nfail to realize that behind the scene there is a new type of compensation\nbetween different spin contributions which different from those of\nsupersymmetry. For the GT presentation of this compensation the reader\nshould consult \\cite{Scharf}, some remarks about its SLFT derivation can be\nfound in \\cite{vector} and the details will be contained in joint work with\nJens Mund.\n\nThe reason why it could be important to understand the correct physical\ncause for the presence of the $H$ (apart from the fact that in a\nfoundational theory as QFT it is always good to know the intrinsic reasons\nfor a new phenomenon) is that the construction of $L,V_{\\mu }$ pairs may\nlead to compensatory situations involving higher spin fields as $g_{\\mu \\nu\n}(x,e)~$together with compensatory $s=1$ and $s=0$ contributions. It would\nnot be necessary that $V_{\\mu }$ has $d_{sd}\\leq 4~$as long as the higher\nshort distance dimensions compensate in higher orders.\n\nIn the Higgs paper \\cite{Higgs} one finds the remark that the $H$-field is\nneeded to generate a mass. In this context there are references to works in\ncondensed matter physics as the phenomenological Landau-Ginsberg description\nof superconductivity and its microscopic BCS refinement (also Anderson's\nwork on energy gaps from a gap-less situation). In all those works already \n\\textit{existing degrees of freedom regroup themselves} (the Cooper pairs)\nand in this way lead to new physical manifestations. But this is precisely\nthe mechanism by which the Hilbert space description of \\textit{massive} QED\nrequires the introduction of a scalar string-local field $\\phi $ (the $\nA_{\\mu }^{\\prime }s$ \"escort\") which depends on the same degrees of freedom\n(namely the $s=1$ Wigner creation/annihilation operators) as the massive\nvector potential.\n\nAs the BCS superconductivity cannot be described without the regroupment of\ncondensed matter degrees of freedom in the form of Cooper pairs, massive QED\nin a Hilbert space setting needs the presence of the (degrees of freedom\nmaintaining) escort field $\\phi .~$Gauge theory in Krein space is a physical\nincomplete theory (no physical substitute for gauge-dependent fields) which\nhas many additional unphysical degrees of freedom (negative metric fields,\nghost fields) but no physical $\\phi $-field. The degree of freedom issue and\nthe appearance of additional fields is a quantum phenomenon which has no\nclassical counterpart. Whereas the perturbative structure of $s<1$ QFT\nmaintains formal relations to classical FT, these links are lost in the\npresence of $s\\geq 1$ fields.\n\nPrecisely for this reason it is important to understand the physical cause \n\\textit{why additional }$H$\\textit{-degrees of freedom are needed in the\npresence of self-interacting massive vector mesons}. It turns out that the\nfirst order modification of the 4-Fermi interaction by intermediate massive\nvector mesons leading a nonabelian massive gauge theory only secured the\nfirst order PCB but that the second order leads to a\nrenormalizability-violating $d_{sd}=5~$term. Since in all previous studied\nmodels of QFT the first order PCB bound $d_{sd}\\leq 4$ always implied\nrenormalizability\\footnote{\nHigher order short distance compensation between fields of different spin\nare only expected in SUSY QFTs.}, this phenomenon was overlooked. The\ninterpretation of the nonabelian Higgs model as resulting from a SSB\nbreaking of gauge invariance obscured this problem since the \\textit{physical\n} understanding of a second order short distance compensation mechanism\ncannot be delegated to formal description of a model as arising from SSB of\ngauge symmetry (a physical symmetry ?). In the more physical SLFT Hilbert\nspace setting for $s=1~$interactions there is no gauge symmetry, so what is\nthe S to which the SSB prescription should be applied ?\n\nOne rather has to realize that the coupling of $H$ fields to massive vector\nmesons defines autonomous theories and that the $H$-selfineractions (the\nMexican hat potential) is \"induced\" and not the result of an imposed SSB.\nThe induction phenomenon, which was explained in the beginning of this\nsection, does not exist for point-local $s<1$ interactions but is\ncharacteristic for interactions involving string-local $s\\geq 1$ fields.\nAnother phenomenon which appears only for $s\\geq 1$ is that a massive model\nwithin first order PCB may violate second order PCB. In such a case one has\nto look for an extension of the model by adding an interaction with an\nadditional field which leads to a second order compensation of the\nrenormalizability threatening second order terms. Precisely this happens for\nself-interacting massive vector mesons in which the compensating fields are $\nH$ fields; this, and not the alleged role of a mass creating midwife, is the\nfoundational purpose of the $H.$\n\nAs far as the classification of all second order compensation of\nself-interacting massive vector mesons of different masses couples with $H$\n-multiplets with different mass is concerned the recipe based on SSB\nbreaking schemes turns out to be quite efficient because the SSB formalism\nleads to the same family of models as the classification of compensations \n\\cite{BDSV}. Nature does not follow the logic of ostensible simplicity of\ncalculational prescriptions of particle theorists but rather sticks to her\nown principles. The relation of pertubative renormalizability with causal\nlocalization in a Hilbert space setting is certainly one of her deep but\nstill insufficiently understood conceptual messages.\n\nThat important discoveries have been made by less than correct reasons is\nnot new; even Dirac's argument in favor of anti-particles was based on the\ninconsistent hole theory. For the experimental discovery of the Higgs\nparticle this made no difference; one may even speculate that the somewhat\nmysterious appeal of the SSB explanation (creating the masses of all\nparticles, including its own) may have been a more important motivating\nforce for the enormous mental and material effort which went into its\ndiscovery at LHC than the preservation of second order renormalizability\n(which to many particle physicists may appear as a d\\`{e}j\\'{a} vu of the\n4-Fermi past).\n\nWhat is a bit worrisome (as compared to the history of antiparticles and\nother important discoveries originally made for less than correct reasons)\nis that the SSB Higgs mechanism still dominates the scene after 4 decades.\nThis raises the question whether explanations which found acceptance within\na globalized community (apart from the tiny group of scholars who noticed\nconceptual inconsistencies) can be still be corrected in times of \"Big\nScience\". In any case the main purpose of the present work is not to address\nsociological problems but rather the presentation of a surprising new look\nat one of QFT's oldest problems: how to formulate $s\\geq 1$ interactions in\na quantum theoretical Hilbert space setting.\n\nThis includes in particular problems involving massless vector potentials.\nThe perturbative infrared divergencies for scattering of electric\ncharge-carrying particles signal the breakdown of the spacetime\nunderstanding of the field-particle relation in terms of (LSZ, Haag-Ruelle)\nscattering theory. Successful momentum space recipes (the Bloch-Nordsieck\nprescription and its Yennie-Frautschi-Suura refinement \\cite{YFS}) for\nphoton-inclusive cross sections cannot hide the fact that GT, as a result of\nabsence of charge-carrying matter fields, is not able to solve this problem.\n\nOne expects that the new SLFT theory sheds new light on this age-old\nproblem. After all passing form point-local fields in GT to covariant\nstring-local interacting fields is not the result of a playful attitude to\ntry out something else (as in ST), but rather the inevitable consequence of\nupholding one of quantum theory's most cherished principles: the positivity\nof the Hilbert space.\n\nThe correct analog of quantum mechanical long-range Coulomb potentials are\nstring-local charge-carrying matter fields. The associated particles are\nstill registered in compact localized counters; the only influence of\nnoncompact field localization on particle counting events are spread over a\nlarger spacetime region. As previously mentioned there exist rigorous\nresults based on the quantum Gauss law which show the noncompactness of\ncharge localization and the \"stiffness\" of string-local charge-carrying\nstates whose directions (different from that of their massive counterparts)\ncause a spontaneous breaking of Lorentz-invariance \\cite{Bu} \\cite{Froe} and\nleads to a radical structural change of the Fock space (see end of previous\nsection).\n\nThe only objects which remain relatively unaffected by the structural\nchanges in the massless limit are the expectation values of string-local\nfields. Their calculation in the massive case requires the use of the\npoint-local interaction densities $(TL..L)^{P}$ (\\ref{indep}) as well as the\nrelation (\\ref{psi}) between point- and string-local matter fields. The\nextension of the on-shell S-matrix formalism to off-shell string-local\nfields is an ambitious program which has been initiated by Jens Mund. One\nexpects that its leads to both renormalizable (Wightman-localizable)\nstring-local and singular (Jaffe class) point-local matter fields. Only the\nstring-local correlations are expected to possess a massless limit; they\naccount for the properties of the \"rigid\" (SSB L-invariance-breaking)\nelectric charge-carrying strings.\n\nThe QED Hilbert space and the string-local operators acting in it are then\ndetermined in terms of Wightman's reconstruction theorem \\cite{St-Wi}. They\nshould provide the spacetime explanation for the change of the electron\nmass-shell into a milder cut-like singularity and the momentum space recipes\nwhich replace the vanishing scattering amplitudes of charge-carrying\nparticles by the recipe for photon-inclusive cross sections.\n\nA more radical behavior is expected in the massless limit of\nself-interacting vector mesons. The conjectured confinement means that only\ncorrelations which contain solely point-local hadron and gluonium composites\nas well as \"string-bridged\" $q-\\bar{q}$ pairs will survive this limit\nwhereas correlation containing string-local gluon or quark fields vanish.\nFrom the analogy with the vanishing QED scattering amplitudes for\nelectrically charged particles with a finite number of participating photons\none expects that there will be logarithmic infrared divergencies in the\npresence of gluon or quark operators whose summation of leading perturbative\ncontributions for $m<<1$ will lead to functions which vanish in the massless\nlimit.\n\nBut does this conjecture have a chance to be confirmed by perturbative\ncalculations? Certainly not in GT, since off-shell correlation functions in\ncovariant gauges are known to remain infrared finite \\cite{Hollands}. But\nthe directional fluctuations of string-local fields have stronger infrared\nramifications than the point-local fields in covariant gauges of GT. They\nare expected to be especially strong in the presence of self-interacting\nvector potentials. The lowest order candidate for testing the possible\npresence of an off-shell logarithmic divergence for $m\\rightarrow 0~$would\nbe the $e$-dependent second order $F$-$F~$propagator. The off-shell\nperturbation theory for string-local fields is presently under construction.\n\n\\section{Gauge theory and local quantum physics}\n\nDespite significant conceptual differences between GT and SLFT there are\nalso formal analogies. A comparison between these two ways of describing QFT\nof $s=1$ fields leads to a better understanding of their mutual relation. In\nthe absence of interactions the differences only affects a fine point in the\ninterpretation of causality in gauge invariant Wilson loops (section 3), but\nthey increase in the presence of interactions. The construction of the\nglobally gauge invariant S-matrix is a good illustration.\n\nThe CGI BRST operator formalism handles this problem in the following way.\nInstead of (\\ref{lin}) one writes \n\n", "index": 51, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nA_{\\mu }^{K}(x)-\\partial _{\\mu }\\phi ^{K}=:A_{\\mu }^{P,K}(x)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E23.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"A_{\\mu}^{K}(x)-\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi^{K}=:A_{\\mu}^{P,K}(x)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>K</mi></msubsup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mo>\u2202</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi></msub><msup><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>K</mi></msup><mo>=</mo><mo>:</mo><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>K</mi></mrow></msubsup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04528.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith arbitrary real coupling coefficient $f_{abc}$, the implementation of\noperator gauge invariance (\\ref{gauge}) up to second order requires these\ncoefficients to satisfy the Lie-algebra relation of the adjoint\nrepresentation. This continues to hold if one allows the masses to be\ndifferent and uses the most general first order couplings within the\npower-counting restriction, including the $H$-coupling which one needs for\nthe preservation of second order renormalizability. One obtains the same\nrelations between couplings and masses as those obtained by imposing the\nformal SSB prescription on the massless gauge invariant Lagrangian \\cite\n{BDSV} but this time from merely imposing the BRST gauge invariance (\\ref\n{gauge}) on the tree approximation up to third order.\n\nAt first sight I found this very impressive, but in phone conservations and\nemail exchanges Raymond Stora (who sadly passed away in June this year)\nconvinced me that one should not be surprised but rather view this as the\nimprint of classical gauge symmetry (connections,fibre bundles) on the BRST\nformalism. The real challenge, according to Stora, is the derivation of this\nLie algebra structure from first principles of QFT.\n\nIn the new SLFT setting which is based on only first principles it is easy\nto formally derive the Lie-algebraic structure in the zero mass limit \\cite\n{vector}. But since the Hilbert space $Q^{\\prime }s~$diverge in the massless\nlimit the result is at best a consistency argument. Only a derivation in the\npresence of self-interacting massive vector mesons can settle this problem\n(the computations have not been finished), but the formal analogies between\nthe two methods leaves little doubts about its validity.\n\nA Lie-algebra structure of mutual couplings between self-interacting vector\nmesons from first principles would mean a symmetry relation between coupling\nstrengths which is not imposed but rather the result of the spacetime\nquantum causality properties of QFT without any support through quantization\nfrom classical gauge theory. This is very different from our usual\nunderstanding of inner symmetries according to which every symmetric theory\ncan be converted into a less symmetric model (more coupling parameters)\nwhile maintaining its field content.\n\nAt this point it is helpful to recall the standard conceptual relation\nbetween the causal localization principles underlying QFT and internal\nsymmetries. If one starts from a QFT in which local fields transforms under\na unitary compact group which leaves the vacuum state invariant, the\nobservable algebra associated with the field algebra is simply the fixed\npoint algebra of the field algebra under the action of the symmetry group.\n\nThe important conceptual enrichment through the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts\nsuperselection theory was that starting from an observable algebra with a\ncausal localization structure (a \"net of spacetime localized algebras\" \\cite\n{Haag}) one can reconstruct a \"field algebra\" with a nontrivial compact\ngroup acting on it from the superselection structure of its inequivalent\nunitary representations. Observable algebras are defined solely in terms of\nspacetime causality concepts of operator algebras; no other group than the\nspacetime Poincar\\'{e} transformations play a role in their definition. Yet\nan observable algebra always leads in a rather canonical way to a field\nalgebra together with a compact group acting on it!\n\nThis construction is somewhat astonishing since at first glance the causal\nlocalization properties of local observables seem to have no connection with\ngroup representation theory; the net of localized observable algebras is\ncovariant under the Poincar\\'{e} group (including the TCP operation) but it\nis no relation to gauge symmetry, be it global or local. Yet the\nclassification of unitarily inequivalent local representations of the\nspacetime-indexed set of local algebras (the local superselection sectors of\nthe observable algebra) leads indeed to a field algebra and a compact groups\nacting on it.\n\nThere is no analog in classical physics, all the classical Lagrangians with\ninternal symmetries are obtained by reading back QFT into the classic realm;\nclassical Maxwell theory and Einstein's field theory of gravitation do not\ncontain internal symmetries. The quantum concept of inner symmetry entered\nparticle physics through Heisenberg's introduction of isospin into nuclear\nphysics.\n\nIn a perturbative view of QFT with inner symmetries one can always think\nabout keeping the same field content but using a less symmetric coupling\n(more independent coupling parameters). In fact the terminology \"symmetry\"\nis only meaningful in contrast with less or no symmetry. The apparent high\nsymmetry of self-interacting $s=1$ vector potentials has no analog for\ninteractions between $s<1$ fields.\n\nThe construction uses only the spacetime causal localization properties; the\ngroup theory is hidden in the composition structure (\"fusion rules\") of the\nlocalization-preserving inequivalent representations (endomorphisms) of the\nobservable algebra \\cite{Haag}. In this way the origin of global symmetries\n(inner symmetries) is fully accounted for in terms of spacetime quantum\nlocalization concepts.\n\nThis is very different for local gauge symmetries. Using our insight into\nthe relation between localization and Hilbert space positivity for\ninteractions involving $s\\geq 1~$interactions we may say local gauge theory\nis the result of forcing a $s=1~$Hilbert space setting which requires to use\nstring-local fields, into a point-local setting. The prize for this is that\nthe pointlike fields act in a Krein space and that we can extract physical\nobjects by noticing that the pointlike formalism comes with an unphysical\nbut useful symmetry which acts in Krein space and whose fixed point algebra\nis the physical algebra of \\textit{local observables} which is generated by\npoint-local physical fields. Although the SLFT Hilbert space setting has no\ngauge symmetry it contains a Lie-algebraic structure in its $f_{abc}$\ncouplings between string-local fields.\n\nThis explains why theoreticians using methods of algebraic QFT had \\cite\n{Haag} problems with gauge symmetries and why a foundational understanding\nrequires new ideas \\cite{Bu-Ro}. The hope is that perturbative observation\nin a Hilbert space setting can be combined with nonperturbative algebraic\nresults from LQP in order to obtain further clarification. It would be very\ninteresting to see whether the perturbative results in this paper can be\nbacked up by structural theorems about possible connection between\ninteracting QFTs involving $s=1$ fields and the need to go beyond the\npoint-local setting of Wightman fields.\n\n\\section{An Outlook}\n\nAs stated in the introduction the principle motivation for writing this\npaper is to direct attention to the beginnings of a new development in QFT,\nwhose aim is preserve renormalizability within a Hilbert space setting for\ninteractions involving $s=1$ fields. In the present attempt we omitted\nmathematical details focused on those conceptual properties which\ndistinguish the new setting from that of gauge theory.\n\nThe clash between zero mass point-local vector potentials and Hilbert space\npositivity, which is resolved by the use of covariant string-local\npotentials, suggests to use such potentials also in the massive case. In\nthis way one constructs string-local siblings of the point-local Proca\npotentials which pass smoothly to their massless counterpart. The important\ngain of such a construction is that the short distance behavior is lowered\nfrom $d_{sd}^{P}=2$ to $d_{sd}^{{}}=1,~$a reduction which gauge theory\nachieves at the prize of abandoning Hilbert space positivity and working\ninstead in a Krein space.\n\nThe use of this observation leads to an extension of renormalization theory\nto interacting string-local vector mesons. Since $d_{sd}=1$ for all $s\\geq\n1, $ the mere fulfillment of the $d_{sd}^{int}\\leq 4~$power counting\nrestriction is easy, but the danger is now that the interaction leads to \n\\textit{completely delocalized} fields in higher orders. In order to avoid\nthis the first order string-local interaction density $L$ must be part of a\nso-called $L,V_{\\mu }~$pair which turns out to be a strong restriction and\nwhose fulfillment in every order leads to normalization conditions which\nmust be fulfilled in all orders of $s=1$ interactions. This has a formal\nsimplicity with the fulfillment of BRST invariance $\\mathfrak{s}S=0$ in\nevery order of perturbation theory.\n\nThe new setting does not invalidate gauge theory but it highlights its\nrestricted physical range. GT permits a correct description of the S-matrix\nof interaction massive vector mesons and local observables, but the physics\nbehind gauge-variant fields remain outside its physical range. This includes\nthe problem of quark confinement and also the spacetime understanding of\nscattering problems in QED. Within the confines of gauge invariance gauge\ntheory is a very successful placeholder of a QFT of $s=1~$particles.\n\nDisregarding structural theorems (TCP, Spin\\&Statistics, derivation of large\ntime scattering,...) whose proof requires Hilbert space positivity, the BRST\nperturbative formulation accounts for the perturbative gauge-invariant local\nobservables (field strength, currents) and (in case of massive vector\nmesons) for the perturbative unitary S-matrix. What is missing are the\nmatter fields which relate the worlds of the causal localization principles\nof QFT with the measurable world of Wigner particles.\n\nIn order to go beyond gauge theory the SLFT Hilbert space setting for the\nS-matrix must be extended to the calculation of string-local correlation\nfunctions, a task which goes significantly beyond the construction of the\nstring-independent S-matrix. Here consistency demands that the counterpart\nof the on-shell string independence should be the independence of vacuum\nexpectation values of string-local fields on $e^{\\prime }s$ of \\textit{inner}\npropagator lines. The perturbative formulation of this idea is presently\nbeing studied.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgement}\nThis work is part of an ongoing project with Jens Mund; its main purpose is\nto strengthen historical roots and interconnections with other results.

Whereas $\\phi ^{K}$ adds unphysical degrees of freedom (which,\nsimilar to a catalyzer in chemistry, have to be removed in physical\noperators and states), the SLFT string-local $\\phi ~$only regroups existing\ndegrees of freedom (as the Cooper pairs in superconductivity); together with\nthe string-local $A_{\\mu }^{P}~$it disappears in the massless limit.\n\nThe $u^{K}$ and $\\hat{u}^{K}$ in (\\ref{Krein}) are added \"ghost\" degree of\nfreedom which serve to formalize the unitarity argument of 't Hooft and\nVeltman but, together with $\\phi ^{K},$ have no physical interpretation.\n\nAs noticed by Mund (private communication), the would-be Krein space Proca\nfield has indeed the same two-point function as its Hilbert space\ncounterpart; but being an object in a larger Krein space (the tensor product\nof two Krein spaces ($s=1$ $~$with $s=0$) extended by the ghosts it \"leaks\"\ninto the tensor-product Krein space, i.e. its \"one-particle vector\" $\n\\left\\vert p\\right\\rangle ^{K}~$is not a Wigner particle but represents the\n\"best Krein space approximation\" of one.\n\nUsing the ghost rules (\\ref{Krein}) one defines a $L^{K},Q_{\\mu }^{K}$ pair\nwhich fulfills \\cite{Scharf} \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n&&\\mathfrak{s}L^{K}-\\partial ^{\\mu }Q_{\\mu }^{K}=0,\\text{ }hence~\\mathfrak{s}\nS^{(1)}=0  \\label{gauge} \\\\\n&&\\mathfrak{s}TL^{K}L^{K\\prime }-\\partial ^{\\mu }TQ_{\\mu }^{K}L^{\\prime\nK}-\\partial ^{\\prime \\mu }TL^{K}Q_{\\mu }^{\\prime K}=0,~hence~\\mathfrak{s}\nS^{(2)}=0  \\notag\n\\end{eqnarray}\nIn analogy to the $e$-independence (\\ref{Q}) with the significant conceptual\ndifference that, whereas $d~$\\textit{acts on the individual spacetime string\ndirections}, the globally acting BRST nilpotent $\\mathfrak{s}~$has has no\nphysical interpretation of its own but only serves to extract a physical\nS-matrix from an unphysical point-local Krein space description.\n\nThe $V~$formalism of SLFT breaks down in the massless limit, but the $Q~$\nformalism (\\ref{Q}), which uses the $u$ instead of the infrared divergent $\n\\phi ,$ remains valid. But since the arguments based on the adiabatic limit\n(the vanishing of divergence terms) break down, one can not use this\nformalism to prevent the infrared divergence of the S-matrix; and with the\nloss of the S-matrix one is left with the recipes for photon-inclusive cross\nsections of GT. An understanding of QED within the principles of QFT (causal\nlocalization of fields in a Hilbert space) is still missing.\n\nWhereas the application of the SLFT Hilbert space formalism is still in its\ninitial stages, the CGI gauge approach exists since the early 90s \\cite\n{Scharf} (see \\cite{BDSV} for a recent account). Its main purpose has been a\nclarification of the Higgs issue. It is the formulation of the BRST GT which\nis closest to the present Hilbert space setting. An attempt in \\cite{Du-S}\nto use it as a platform for Hilbert space formulation of Wigner particles\nturned out to be premature; the central role of the clash between point-like\nlocalization and Hilbert space positivity and its resolution in terms of\nstring-local fields was only recognized in \\cite{MSY} \\cite{P-Y} \\cite{Rio}\nand more recently in \\cite{vector}.\n\nThe formal similarities between CGI and SLFT end when it comes to the\nconstruction of the $e$-independent interaction densities $(TL..L)^{P}$ in\nterms of their string-local counterparts (\\ref{indep}) which together with (\n\\ref{psi}) enter in the construction of off-shell vacuum expectation values\nof string-local fields and their limits for zero mass vector potentials.\nThis is still virgin territory outside the range of GT but within the reach\nof SLFT.\n\nThere are some puzzling observation which came from the CGI perturbative\nimplementation of on-shell gauge invariance $\\mathfrak{s}S=0.$ Quite\nunexpectedly one finds that if one start with the most general ansatz of an\ninteraction density of mutually self-interacting massive vector mesons of\nthe same mass (omitting the superscript $K$)\n\n", "index": 53, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nL=\\sum f_{abc}F^{a.\\mu \\nu }A_{\\mu }^{b}A_{\\nu }^{c}  \\label{f}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E24.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"L=\\sum f_{abc}F^{a.\\mu\\nu}A_{\\mu}^{b}A_{\\nu}^{c}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>.</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi></mrow></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi><mi>b</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>A</mi><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>c</mi></msubsup></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
