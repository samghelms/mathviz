I prove a theorem similar\n  to Lovelock's, with a physically modified assumption: that the\n  geometric object representing curvature in the Einstein field\n  equation ought to have the physical dimension of stress-energy.  The\n  theorem is stronger than Lovelock's in two ways: it holds in all\n  dimensions, and so supports a generalized argument for uniqueness;\n  it does not assume that the desired tensor depends on the metric\n  only up second-order partial-derivatives, that condition being a\n  consequence of the proof.  This has consequences for understanding\n  the nature of the cosmological constant and theories of\n  higher-dimensional gravity.  Another consequence of the theorem is\n  that it makes precise the sense in which there can be no\n  gravitational stress-energy tensor in general relativity.  Along the\n  way, I prove a result of some interest about the second jet-bundle\n  of the bundle of metrics over a manifold.\n\\end{quote}\n\n{\\vspace*{1\\baselineskip}}\n\n\nThe Einstein field equation, $G_{ab} = 8 \\pi \\gamma T_{ab}$ (where\n$\\gamma$ is Newton's gravitational constant) consists of an object\nrepresenting the curvature of spacetime (the Einstein tensor,\n$G_{ab}$) equated with the stress-energy tensor of material fields\n($T_{ab}$).

This guarantees that\nunits of mass and length scale in precisely the same manner as the\ntime-unit when new units of time are chosen by multiplying the\ntime-unit by some fixed real number $\\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$.  (The\nreason for the inverse square-root will become clear in a moment).\nThus, a duration of $t$ time-units would become\n$t\\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ of the new units; an interval of $d$ units\nof length would likewise become $d\\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ in the new\nunits, and $m$ units of mass would become $m\\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ of\nthe new units.  This justifies treating all three of these units as\n``the same'', and so expressing acceleration, say, in inverse\ntime-units.  To multiply the length of all timelike vectors\nrepresenting an interval of time by $\\lambda^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, however,\nis equivalent to multiplying the metric by $\\lambda$ (and so the\ninverse metric by $\\lambda^{-1}$), and indeed such a multiplication is\nthe standard way one represents a change of units in general\nrelativity.  This makes physical sense as the way to capture the idea\nof physical dimension: all physical units, the ones composing the\ndimension of any physical quantity, are geometrized in general\nrelativity in the most natural formulation, and so depend only on the\nscale of the metric itself.  By Weyl's theorem, however, a metric\ntimes a constant represents exactly the same physical phenomena as the\noriginal metric \\cite[ch.~2, \\S1]{malament-fnds-gr-ngt}.\n\nNow, the proper dimension of a stress-energy tensor can be determined\nby the demand that the Einstein field-equation,\n$G_{ab} = 8 \\pi \\gamma T_{ab}$, remain satisfied when one rescales the\nmetric by a constant factor.  $\\gamma$ has dimension\n$\\frac{\\mbox{(length)}^3} {\\mbox{(mass)(time)}^2}$, and so in\ngeometrized units does not change under a constant rescaling of the\nmetric.  Thus $T_{ab}$ ought to transform exactly as $G_{ab}$ under a\nconstant rescaling of the metric.  A simple calculation shows that\n$G_{ab} \\space (= R_{ab} - {\\frac{1}{2}} R g_{ab})$ remains unchanged under\nsuch a rescaling.  Thus, a necessary condition for a tensor to\nrepresent stress-energy is that it remain unchanged under a constant\nrescaling of the metric.  It follows that the concomitant at issue\nmust be homogeneous of weight 0 in the metric, whatever order it may\nbe.\n\nWe must still determine the order of the required concomitant.  In\nfact, the weight of a homogeneous concomitant of the metric suffices\nto fix the differential order of that concomitant.\\footnote{I thank\n  Robert Geroch for pointing this out to me.}  This can be seen as\nfollows, as exemplified by the case of a two covariant-index,\nhomogeneous concomitant $S_{ab}$ of the metric.  A simple calculation\nbased on definition~\\ref{defn:nth-concoms} and on the fact that the\nconcomitant must be homogeneous shows that the value at a point\n$p \\in \\mathcal{M}$ of an $n^{\\text{th}}$-order concomitant $S_{ab}$\ncan be written in the general form\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 10335, "prevtext": "\nbut $\\nabla_b \\nabla_c \\xi^a - \\nabla_c \\nabla_b \\xi^a = 2 R^a\n{}_{bcn} \\xi^n$ and $C^a {}_{bc} = 0$, so expanding the only remaining\nterm gives\n", "index": 11, "text": "\n\\[\n\\xi^n \\nabla_a C^c {}_{bn} = 0\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\xi^{n}\\nabla_{a}C^{c}{}_{bn}=0\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msup><mi>\u03be</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><msub><mo>\u2207</mo><mi>a</mi></msub><msup><mi>C</mi><mi>c</mi></msup><mmultiscripts><mo>=</mo><mprescripts/><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><none/></mmultiscripts><mn>0</mn></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03032.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere: $\\widetilde{\\nabla}_a$ is any derivative operator at $p$\n\\emph{other} than the one naturally associated with $g_{ab}$; `$x$' is\na dummy abstract index; `$\\widetilde{\\nabla}_x^{(n_i)}$' stands for\n$n_i$ iterations of that derivative operator (obviously each with a\ndifferent abstract index); $\\alpha$ takes its values in the set of all\npermutations of all sets of positive integers $\\{ n_1, \\ldots, n_i \\}$\nthat sum to $n$, so $i$ can range in value from 1 to $n$; the\nexponents of the derivative operators in each summand themselves take\ntheir values from $\\alpha$, \\emph{i}.\\emph{e}., they are such that\n$n_1 + \\cdots + n_i = n$ (which makes it an $n^{\\text{th}}$-order\nconcomitant); for each $\\alpha$, $k_\\alpha$ is a constant; and there\nare just enough of the inverse metrics in each summand to contract all\nthe covariant indices but $a$ and $b$.\n\nNow, a combinatorial calculation shows\n\\begin{prop}\n  \\label{prop:nth-concom-factor}\n  If, for $n \\geq 2$, $S_{ab}$ is an $n^{\\text{th}}$-order homogeneous\n  concomitant of $g_{ab}$, then to rescale the metric by the constant\n  real number $\\lambda$ multiplies $S_{ab}$ by $\\lambda^{n - 2}$.\n\\end{prop}\nIn other words, the only such homogeneous $n^{\\text{th}}$-order\nconcomitants must be of weight $\\lambda - 2$.\\footnote{The exponent\n  $(n - 2)$ in this result depends crucially on the fact that $S_{ab}$\n  has only two indices, both covariant.  One can generalize the result\n  for tensor concomitants of the metric of any index structure.  A\n  slight variation of the argument, moreover, shows that there does\n  not in general exist a homogeneous concomitant of a given\n  differential order from a tensor of a given index structure to one\n  of another structure---one may not be able to get the number and\n  type of the indices right by contraction and tensor multiplication\n  alone.}  So if one knew that $S_{ab}$ were multiplied by, say,\n$\\lambda^4$ when the metric was rescaled by $\\lambda$, one would know\nthat it had to be a sixth-order concomitant.  In particular, $S_{ab}$\ndoes not rescale when $g_{ab} \\rightarrow \\lambda g_{ab}$ only if it\nis a second-order homogeneous concomitant of $g_{ab}$,\n\\emph{i}.\\emph{e}., (by theorem~\\ref{thm:1-2-jet-metric} and\nproposition~\\ref{prop:0-concoms-riemann}) a zeroth-order concomitant\nof the Riemann tensor.  There follows from\nproposition~\\ref{prop:con-composition}\n\\begin{lemma}\n  \\label{lem:riem-0th-concom-0-homog}\n  A 2-covariant index concomitant of the Riemann tensor is homogeneous\n  of weight zero if and only if it is a zeroth-order concomitant.\n\\end{lemma}\nThus, such a tensor has the physical dimension of stress-energy if and\nonly if it is a zeroth-order concomitant of the Riemann tensor.  It is\nstriking how powerful the physically motivated assumption that the\nrequired object have the physical dimensions of stress-energy: it\nguarantees that the required object will be a second-order concomitant\nof the metric.\n\nNow, it follows from proposition~\\ref{prop:0-concoms-riemann} that the\nonly possibilities for geometrical objects to place on the lefthand\nside of a field equation that would play the role of the Einstein\nfield equation are linear combinations of the Ricci tensor and the\nscalar curvature multiplied by the metric.  The only covariantly\ndivergence-free, linear combinations of those two quantities, however,\nare constant multiples of the Einstein tensor $G_{ab}$.  (To see this,\nnote that if there were another, say $k_1 R_{ab} + k_2 R g_{ab}$ for\nconstants $k_1$ and $k_2$, then\n$k_1 R_{ab} + k_2 R g_{ab} - 2k_2 G_{ab}$ would also be divergence\nfree, but that expression is just a constant multiple of the Ricci\ntensor.)  This proves theorem~\\ref{thm:only-einstein-tens}.  A benefit\nof the proof is that it gives real geometrical and physical insight\ninto the result, insight not provided by Lovelock's original proof of\ntheorem~\\ref{thm:lovelock}, which consists of several pages of\nunilluminating coordinate-based, brute-force calculation.\n\nTheorem~\\ref{thm:only-einstein-tens} shows the uniqueness of the\nEinstein field equation in all dimensions.  The theorem is similar to\nLovelock's result, but different in four important ways. The first\ndifference is that I require the concomitant of the metric to be\nhomogeneous of weight zero.  The physical interpretation of this is\nthat the desired tensor has the physical dimensions of stress-energy,\nas is the case for the Einstein tensor, and as must be the case for\nany tensor that one would equate to a material stress-energy tensor to\nformulate a field equation.  This provides a physical interpretation\nto the conditions of the theorem that Lovelock's theorem lacks.  It\nalso leads to the second difference: one does not need to assume that\nthe desired concomitant is second-order; that property falls naturally\nout of the proof.\n\nThe third difference is that the theorem holds in all dimensions, not\njust in four.  It follows that, in dimensions other than four, the\nso-called Lovelock tensors ar not homogeneous of weight zero, and so\ndo not have the physical dimension of stress-energy.  Thus, if one\nwants to construct a field equation that equates a linear combination\nof them to the stress-energy tensor of ordinary matter, as Lovelock\ntheories of gravity do, then the coupling constants cannot be\ndimensionless like Newton's gravitational constant; the physical\ndimension of each coupling constant will be determined by the physical\ndimension of the Lovelock tensor it multiplies.\n\nThe fourth difference is that the addition of constant multiples of\nthe metric is not allowed. I interpret that to mean that any\ncosmological-constant term must be construed as part of the total\nstress-energy tensor of spacetime, and so, in particular, the\ncosmological constant itself must have the physical dimensions of\n(mass)$^2$.\n\nFinally, theorem~\\ref{thm:only-einstein-tens} has another natural\ninterpretation: it shows in a precise and rigorous sense the\nnonexistence of a gravitational stress-energy tensor.  If there were\nsuch a thing, we would expect it to depend on curvature, and so be\nzero in and only in flat spacetimes.  Constant multiples of the\nEinstein tensor, however, are not appropriate candidates for the\nrepresentation of gravitational stress-energy: the Einstein tensor\nwill be zero in a spacetime having a vanishing Ricci tensor but a\nnon-trivial Weyl tensor; such spacetimes, however, can manifest\nphenomena, \\emph{e}.\\emph{g}., pure gravitational radiation in the\nabsence of ponderable matter, that one naturally wants to say possess\ngravitational energy in some (necessarily non-localized) form or\nother.\\footnote{This argument, by the way, obviates the criticism of\n  the claim that gravitational stress-energy ought to depend on the\n  curvature.  The critics point out that that would make gravitational\n  stress-energy depend on second-order partial derivatives of the\n  field potential, whereas all other known forms of stress-energy\n  depend only on terms quadratic in the first partial derivatives of\n  the field potential.  It is, however, exactly second-order,\n  homogeneous concomitants of the metric that possess terms quadratic\n  in the first partials.  The rule is that the order of a homogeneous\n  concomitant is the sum of the exponents of the derivative operators\n  when the concomitant is represented in the form of\n  equation~\\eqref{eq:Sab-form}.}  (See\n\\citeNP{curiel-geom-objs-nonexist-sab-uniq-efe} for extended\ndiscussion of this and other intpretational issues raised in this\npaper.)\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem[\\protect\\citeauthoryear{Curiel}{Curiel}{2015}]{curiel-geom-objs-nonexist-sab-uniq-efe}\nCuriel, E.

By Weyl's theorem, however, a metric\ntimes a constant represents exactly the same physical phenomena as the\noriginal metric \\cite[ch.~2, \\S1]{malament-fnds-gr-ngt}.\n\nNow, the proper dimension of a stress-energy tensor can be determined\nby the demand that the Einstein field-equation,\n$G_{ab} = 8 \\pi \\gamma T_{ab}$, remain satisfied when one rescales the\nmetric by a constant factor.  $\\gamma$ has dimension\n$\\frac{\\mbox{(length)}^3} {\\mbox{(mass)(time)}^2}$, and so in\ngeometrized units does not change under a constant rescaling of the\nmetric.  Thus $T_{ab}$ ought to transform exactly as $G_{ab}$ under a\nconstant rescaling of the metric.  A simple calculation shows that\n$G_{ab} \\space (= R_{ab} - {\\frac{1}{2}} R g_{ab})$ remains unchanged under\nsuch a rescaling.  Thus, a necessary condition for a tensor to\nrepresent stress-energy is that it remain unchanged under a constant\nrescaling of the metric.  It follows that the concomitant at issue\nmust be homogeneous of weight 0 in the metric, whatever order it may\nbe.\n\nWe must still determine the order of the required concomitant.  In\nfact, the weight of a homogeneous concomitant of the metric suffices\nto fix the differential order of that concomitant.\\footnote{I thank\n  Robert Geroch for pointing this out to me.}  This can be seen as\nfollows, as exemplified by the case of a two covariant-index,\nhomogeneous concomitant $S_{ab}$ of the metric.  A simple calculation\nbased on definition~\\ref{defn:nth-concoms} and on the fact that the\nconcomitant must be homogeneous shows that the value at a point\n$p \\in \\mathcal{M}$ of an $n^{\\text{th}}$-order concomitant $S_{ab}$\ncan be written in the general form\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eq:Sab-form}\n  S_{ab} = \\sum_\\alpha k_\\alpha \\, g^{qx} \\ldots g^{xr} \\left(\n    \\widetilde{\\nabla}_x^{(n_1)} g_{qx} \\right) \\ldots \\left(\n    \\widetilde{\\nabla}_x^{(n_i)} g_{xr} \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S_{ab}=\\sum_{\\alpha}k_{\\alpha}\\,g^{qx}\\ldots g^{xr}\\left(\\widetilde{\\nabla}_{x%&#10;}^{(n_{1})}g_{qx}\\right)\\ldots\\left(\\widetilde{\\nabla}_{x}^{(n_{i})}g_{xr}\\right)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi></munder><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msub><mi>k</mi><mi>\u03b1</mi></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mo>\u2207</mo><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>x</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mo>\u2207</mo><mo>~</mo></mover><mi>x</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>g</mi><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>r</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
