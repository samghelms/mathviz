Collective behaviors make  social systems interesting for \nthe physicist and, reciprocally, the physicist might contribute with a new perspective \nto the comprehension of social phenomena. \n\nOne of the basic ingredients to be taken into account \nfor modeling people's interactions is imitation, or social contagion. \nIn fact, imitation is  observed in diverse social contexts, \nsuch as in the dynamics of language learning or decision making. \nThe recurrent conformity to the attitudes,  opinions or decisions  \nof other individuals, or groups of individuals, has \nled to the formulation of models based on social contagion as \nthe primary rule of opinion dynamics, e.g., the voter~\\cite{voter}, Sznajd~\\cite{sznajd} and \nmajority rule~\\cite{majority} models, to give just a few examples. \nHowever, aside from imitation, individuals also \ndissent and resist to be influenced, in several ways.  \n\nIn the present work, we study the effect of nonconformity attitudes   \nthrough a kinetic exchange model~\\cite{sen_book,sen,lccc,biswas}. \nWithin this modeling, the influences that an individual exerts over \nanother are modulated by a coupling strength. \nThe coupling strength between connected individuals typically takes positive values but also, \nwith certain probability,  it can adopt negative ones.  \n\nNegative values represent negative influences that, instead of imitation, promote dissent. \nNotice that this kind of dissent is not a characteristic of the individual but of the tie \n(or link) between each pair of individuals. \n\nThere are also other types of nonconformity, which are not associated to the links \n   but to the individuals (or nodes in the network of contacts), as taken into account in \nseveral models~\\cite{galam,lalama,sznajd_indep1,sznajd_indep2,sznajd_indep3,nuno_indep,javarone,bagnoli}. \n\nOne of these types  is  anticonformity~\\cite{willis,nail}. \nAn anticonformist actively dissents from other people's opinions, \nwhich is the case contemplated, for example, by  Galam's contrarians~\\cite{galam_book,galam_review}. \nActually,  although these anticonformists defy other people's opinions or the group norm, \nthey are similar to conformists in the sense that they take into account other's opinions too. \n\nA different kind of nonconformity is independence, such that the individual tends to resist the influences of other \nagents or groups of agents, ignoring their choices in the adoption process. \nIt can be thought either as an attribute of the agent, that acts as independent with certain probability, \nor an attitude that any individual can assume with certain frequency. It is in the latter sense \nthat we will incorporate independence into the model. \n\nAnother important ingredient for modeling  opinion dynamics is \nconviction or persuasion (a kind of stubbornness or resistance \nto change mind)~\\cite{galam_book,sen_book,sen,deffuant2,nuno_celia,brugna,nuno_pmco_jstat,xiong,nuno_jstat,\nsibona,marlon}. \nWe will consider the heterogeneity of the individuals in that respect. \nEach agent will be characterized by a parameter that measures its level of conviction \nabout the opinion it supports. This parameter, typically defined positive, \nwill be allowed to take also negative values  to represent  volatile individuals \nthat change mind easily.   \n\n \nHeterogeneities and disorder can act on  opinion dynamics as  stochastic drivings \nable to promote a phase transition,   \nplaying  the role of a source of randomness or noise similar \nto a social temperature~\\cite{lalama,sznajd_indep2,sznajd_indep3,nuno_indep,nuno_celia,victor}. \n\nWe will focus on the impact of all the abovementioned sources of disorder on the steady state \ndistribution of opinions in the population, \nand investigate the occurrence of nonequilibrium phase transitions. \n\n \n\n\n\n\\section{Modeling}\n\n\\qquad \nOur model belongs to the class of kinetic exchange opinions models~\\cite{sen,lccc,biswas}. \n\nWe consider a fully-connected population of size $N$ participating in a public debate. \nEach agent $i$ in this artificial society has an opinion $o_{i}$.  \nMost models of opinion dynamics deal with a  discrete state \nspace~\\cite{loreto_rmp,galam_review,pawel}, \nwhich may be enough to tackle certain problems that involve binary or several particular choices. \nHowever,  to investigate, for instance, the emergence of extreme opinions, \nit seems to be  more suitable to represent opinions by means of a continuous \nvariable,  to reflect the  possible shades of peoples' attitudes about a given \nsubject~\\cite{deffuant2,sibona,marlon,fan,hk,deffuant,deffuant3,lorenz,coda,wu}.  \n\nThen, we will consider a continuous state space, where opinions can take values  \nin the real range $[-1,1]$. \n\nPositive (negative) values indicate that the position is favorable (unfavorable) to the topic under discussion. \nOpinions tending to $1$ and $-1$ indicate extremist individuals. \nFinally, opinions near $0$ mean neutral or undecided agents. \n\n\n\nAt a given step  $s$, the following microscopic rules control the opinion dynamics:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item We choose two random agents $i$ and $j$. \n\n\\item With probability $q$, the agent $i$ acts as independent. \nIn this case, the agent chooses a position about the subject under discussion, \ni.e., $o_{i}(s+1)$ is randomly selected from a uniform distribution $[-1,1]$, \nindependently of the current states $o_{i}(s)$ and $o_{j}(s)$. \nThat is, as commented above, we consider that independence is not an attribute of the individual \nbut an attitude that any individual  \ncan occasionally assume with certain probability.  In that opportunity,  individuals choose their own position (state) \nindependently of the other individuals~\\cite{sznajd_indep1,sznajd_indep2,sznajd_indep3,nuno_indep}. \n\n\n \n\\item Otherwise, with probability $1-q$, the agent $i$ acts as a partially conformist individual, \nand will be influenced by agent $j$ by means of a kinetic exchange. \nIn this case, the opinion of agent $i$ will be updated according to  the rule \\cite{lccc,biswas}\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \\label{eq1}\no_{i}(s+1) = c_i o_{i}(s)+\\mu_{ij}\\,o_{j}(s) ~,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math

However, the population does not reach the state $O=1$  anymore, \ndifferently to the case $p=0$ of Figure~\\ref{fig1}. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure5.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Order parameter $O$ versus the independence probability $q$, \nfor several values of the fraction $w$ of negative convictions, when $p=0$.\nOne can observe order-disorder transitions at different points $q_{c}(w)$, \nbut the transition is suppressed for  sufficiently large values of $w$. \nThe population size is $N=10^{4}$ and data are averaged over $100$ simulations. \n }\n\\label{fig5}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n \nIn addition, one observes that the critical values $q_{c}(w)$ \nare much smaller than in Sec.~\\ref{case1},  \nwhere   $c_{i}=1$ for all $i$ but negative pairwise interactions $\\mu_{ij}$ (i.e., $p>0$) were allowed. \n\nWe estimated the values of the critical points $q_{c}(w)$ \nby means of the crossing of the Binder cumulant curves, \nas well as the critical exponents, as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig6} for the \ncase $w=0.2$. \n\nThese exponents are the same as the ones of the previous section, \nnamely $\\beta\\approx 1/2$, $\\gamma\\approx 1$ and $\\nu\\approx 2$. \nThus, the universality class of the model is not changed by the presence of disorder \nin the convictions, as expected.\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure6a.eps}\n\\hspace{0.5cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure6b.eps}\n\\\\\n\\vspace{1.0cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure6c.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Finite-size scaling analysis of the transition for $w=0.2$ and $p=0.0$. \nThe best data collapse  was found for $q_{c}\\approx 0.079$, $\\beta\\approx 1/2$, $\\gamma\\approx 1$ and $\\nu\\approx 2$.}\n\\label{fig6}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig7} shows the resulting phase diagram in the plane $q$ versus $w$, \nusing the values of $q_{c}(w)$ obtained from FSS.\n\nThe boundary separates the ordered and disordered phases. \n\nFollowing the same analysis of Sec.~\\ref{case1}, we estimated the \nqualitative behavior of the order-disorder frontier by means of Eq.~(\\ref{eq5}), \nwith the change $p\\to w$.  \nThe result is plotted in Figure~\\ref{fig7} together with the critical points obtained \nfrom FSS analysis. \n\nOne can see a good agreement between the data and the qualitative frontier. \nIn this case,  $c\\approx 0$ and the extreme critical values   are \n$q_{c}(w=0)=b\\approx 0.12$ and $w_{c}(q=0)=-b/a\\approx 0.63$.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure7.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Phase diagram of the model  in the plane $q$ (probability of independence) versus $w$ (probability of negative convictions), when $p=0$.

We characterized the critical transitions, \nas well as the emerging phases, in terms of moderate and extremist individuals.\n\nParameters  $p$, $w$ and $q$ rule microscopic disorder in the system, and their increase triggers  \ntransitions from collective order to disorder.\nThese transitions are characterized by mean-field exponents and their critical curves are shown in Figures ~\\ref{fig3} and ~\\ref{fig7}. \n\nWhen only one source of heterogeneity is present, like in the case of Sec.~\\ref{case1}, \nwhere the convictions are given by $c_i=1$ for all $i$, but there is a probability $p>0$ of negative couplings, \npatterns of opinions like those shown in Figure~\\ref{fig4} occur. \nQualitatively similar patterns arise when the pairwise interactions are $\\mu_{ij}=1$ for all $i,j$ but convictions are random.\n\nIn the disordered phase, opinions are evenly distributed. \nIn the ordered ones,   extremists dominate.\n\nThe steady states show the presence of a large number of extremists with opinions either $o=1$ or $o=-1$. \nThe fraction of these extremists decreases for increasing values \nof the independence parameter $q$, and the system tends to become disordered, indicating \nthat independent attitudes reduce extreme opinions.\n\nDifferent patterns emerge when there are two sources of heterogeneity, with negative values or not, \nlike in the case of  Sec.~\\ref{case2}, \nwhere the couplings and the convictions are random. \n\nIn the disordered phase, opinions are not evenly distributed, but moderate opinions dominate, with a peak around the neutral state. In the ordered phases, one of the opinion sides disappears. When a second source of heterogeneity is present, the increase of volatile individuals (increasing $w$) or of dissent interactions (positive $p$), reduces, even extinguishes, the fraction of extremists and also prevents the arrival to consensus. \n\nThe models considered in this work contribute to the analysis of the role of the diverse features that characterize individuals and their interactions. \nAs can be seen in this paper, each modification yields phase diagrams of order parameters that seem similar, however a quite different phenomenology arises in terms of the distribution of opinions. This hinders unification, justifying a separate analysis of different versions of the model. These versions  shed light on the origin and role of undecided individuals and extremism uprise, and the effect of realistic characteristics like conviction and independence in the dynamics of opinion formation and evolution. In particular, the models contribute to understand the circumstances which favor the emergence and development of extremism in a fraction of the population, relating that emergence with the existence of individuals with strong positive convictions in the population. On the other hand, the presence of negative convictions, that represent volatile individuals that have a propensity to change mind, as well as nonconformity represented in the model by the independent behavior, lead to the dominance of moderate individuals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThe authors acknowledge financial support from the Brazilian funding agencies CNPq and FAPERJ.\n\n\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{30}\n\n \n\\bibitem{loreto_rmp}\nC.

The population size is $N=10^{4}$ \nand data are averaged over $100$ simulations.}\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n \n\n\nThe transition occurs even when couplings are all positive ($p=0$),   \nthen the mere presence of independence  leads the system to undergo  a phase transition. \n\nA similar effect was observed in the discrete version of the present model, \nconsidering only opinions $o=-1$, $0$, $1$, \nalthough the critical point $q_c(p=0)$ has a  different value (1/4 in the discrete case~\\cite{nuno_indep}). \n \n\n\nWhen we introduce negative interaction strengths ($p>0$),  states characterized by $O=1$, \nmeaning consensus of extreme opinions, become unlikely (see Figure~\\ref{fig1}). \nMoreover,  the critical values $q_{c}$ decrease with $p$ and, above sufficiently large $p$, \nthe system becomes  disordered  for any $q$. \nThe critical value $p_{c}(q=0)\\approx 0.34$ is in accord  with that found in Ref.~\\cite{biswas}. \n  \n\nTo estimate the critical points $q_{c}(p)$, we performed a finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis. \nAs a typical example, we exhibit in Figure~\\ref{fig2} the results of FSS for $p=0.1$. \nThe critical exponents  are $\\beta\\approx 1/2$, $\\gamma\\approx 1$ and $\\nu\\approx 2$. \nThus, as expected, the universality class known for the mean-field implementation of the model when $q=0$~\\cite{biswas} \nis not altered by the presence of the microscopic disorder introduced by independence. \n \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\vspace{0.5cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure2a.eps}\n\\hspace{0.5cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure2b.eps}\n\\\\\n\\vspace{1.0cm}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.3\\textwidth,angle=270]{figure2c.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Finite-size scaling analysis of the transition as a function of $q$, for $p=0.1$ and \n$c_i=1$ for all $i$. \nThe best data collapse  was found for $q_{c}\\approx 0.173$, $\\beta\\approx 1/2$, \n$\\gamma\\approx 1$ and $\\nu\\approx 2$.}\n\\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FSS analysis also provides the critical values $q_{c}(p)$, \nthat allow to build a phase diagram in the plane $q$ versus $p$, depicted in  Figure~\\ref{fig3}. \nThe boundary separates the ordered and disordered phases. \nIn the ordered phase, for $q<q_{c}(p)$, \none of the sides (positive or negative opinions) \nwill win the debate, while in the disordered phase, there will be balance of opposite opinions and/or \ndominance of moderate ones. \n\n\nFollowing the analytical expression found for the discrete kinetic exchange opinion \nmodels~\\cite{nuno_celia},  namely a quotient of two first order polynomials in $p$, \nwe propose  a qualitative description of the phase boundary through\n\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq5}\nq_{c}(p)=\\frac{a\\,p+b}{c\\,p+1}  ~,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"q_{c}(p)=\\frac{a\\,p+b}{c\\,p+1}~{},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>q</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>p</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>a</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>c</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
