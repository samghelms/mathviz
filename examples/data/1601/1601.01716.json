It is able to naturally explain several questions like the particle horizon or the flatness problems of early cosmology, among others \\cite{liddle}. Remarkably, this paradigm also explains the origin of the large scale structure. It requires, however, the quantum principles for this mechanism to work \\cite{lang,muk-brandng}. Then, it is one of the most favorable situations where quantum gravity phenomena can potentially be detected. Among the different candidates for a quantum theory of gravity, Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is one of the most developed approaches \\cite{thiem}. Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), the application of LQG techniques to cosmological scenarios, has demonstrated to be a trustworthy formalism \\cite{revLQC}, where the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, as well as it preserves upon evolution the semiclassicality of quantum states \\cite{aps}. This formalism provides an extension of the inflationary scenarios to the Planck era, opening the possibility of potentially studying high energy physics and quantum gravity phenomena.\n\nAmong the different proposals to study cosmological models that include small inhomogeneities in the framework of LQC so far, there is a well known proposal that adopts the so-called {\\it dressed metric} approach \\cite{AAN1}. There, the equations of motion of the perturbations evolving on a quantum geometry are influenced by (not all but some of) the fluctuations of the background quantum state. This proposal is based on the {\\it hybrid quantization} \\cite{hybrid}, that assumes that the main contributions of quantum geometry are incorporated in the background degrees of freedom, while the inhomogeneities are described by means of a standard representation (for instance a Fock quantization). This is a regime between full quantum gravity and quantum field theories on curved spacetimes. It was originally applied to Gowdy cosmologies, providing a consistent and successful quantization free of singularities. Afterwards, this quantization was extended to other models, like Gowdy cosmologies coupled to matter \\cite{LRS-gowdy}. It was also adopted for the study of cosmological inflationary models with small scalar inhomogeneities, where it was provided a full quantization \\cite{hybr-inf1,hybr-inf1b}. However, the dynamics has not been fully understood yet. In Ref. \\cite{hybr-inf2} the quantum dynamics was partially solved, assuming a Born--Oppenheimer ansatz for the solutions to the homogeneous scalar constraint, allowing one to recover a dressed metric regime (under certain approximations) from a more general formalism. Finally, in Ref. \\cite{hybr-inf3}, a generally covariant formalism for scalar perturbations has been developed in order to strengthen the predictions of this hybrid approach. There, after a canonical transformation in the phase space (of the perturbed theory), the authors are able to explicitly identify the true physical degrees of freedom (Mukhanov--Sasaki variables) without carrying out any gauge fixing. They adopt a Born--Oppenheimer ansatz, derive the dressed metric regime within this fully covariant formalism and provide the effective equations of motion. \n\nThe genuine (loop) quantum dynamics of the background spacetime is a key issue for the dressed metric approach, since all its richness lays in the quantum fluctuations. It is very well known for a free massless scalar field \\cite{aps}, but, whenever a potential is added, the dynamics becomes sufficiently intricate that only an effective description has been considered so far \\cite{sloan}. Nevertheless, one can restrict the study to those states for which the dressed metric and the effective dynamics are in agreement (assuming that they exist). Within this approximation, the only relevant magnitude to be provided is the value of the scalar field at the bounce (once its mass has been fixed) for the homogeneous model. For the inhomogeneities, nevertheless, one specifies the initial data by choosing a suitable vacuum state (usually) at that time. However, this is the most important conceptual question to be understood. In previous studies \\cite{AAN1, AAN2}, there have been proposed some candidates, the so-called adiabatic states \\cite{adiab-LR,adiab-reg-PF,adiab-reg-AP}, mainly focusing in the fourth order ones. On the one hand, the physical predictions obtained from these adiabatic initial conditions for the perturbations at the bounce seem to be in good agreement with observations whenever the scales for which one obtains large corrections are beyond the observable ones in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In those situations the main quantum corrections only affect the amplitude of the large scale temperature anisotropies of the CMB, i.e. the range of modes that are either not observable or just entering today the horizon. On the other hand, considering adiabatic states of high order (fourth order or more), a ultraviolet renormalization scheme is available for the stress-energy tensor in order to compute the physical energy density of the perturbations \n\\cite{adiab-LR,adiab-reg-PF,adiab-reg-AP}. Nonetheless, it is not completely clear that such family of states (or equivalently initial conditions) is the physically preferred choice, at least for those values of the scalar field at the bounce that do not give primordial power spectra where the scales with strong corrections are at the limit of the range of observability or beyond (usually those that do not produce large number of e-foldings).\n\nThe purpose of this manuscript is to study different primordial power spectra for scalar perturbations that can be obtained from the hybrid quantized model commented above \\cite{hybr-inf2,hybr-inf3}, and qualitatively confront the obtained physical predictions with observations provided by Planck mission \\cite{planck, planck-inf}. We will assume that the states of the background are highly peaked on the effective geometry, so that it is in good agreement with the dressed metric regime of the hybrid approach.\\footnote{It is worth to mention that the quantum corrections obtained for the dynamics of the scalar perturbations in the hybrid quantization approach are expected to be different from the ones obtained with the dressed metric approach because of the different implementation of the polymeric (and inverse volume) corrections.} This consideration allows us to determine the dynamics of the background and the perturbations by means of a set of differential equations that incorporate quantum geometry corrections. For convenience, we will consider initial data at the bounce, since the background dynamics is fully determined by one parameter: the value of the homogeneous mode of the scalar field. In order to face the question of the vacuum state of the perturbations at the bounce, i.e. their initial conditions, we have investigated a genuine algorithm to compute an initial vacuum state in such a way that the time variation of the amplitude of the Mukhanov--Sasaki variable from the bounce to the end of the kinematically dominated epoch is relieved. This method provides a vacuum state at the bounce that produces a primordial power spectrum at the end of inflation that is in good agreement with the current observations of Planck mission. Remarkably, it is suppressed at large scales, as it seems to be favored by current observations. It does not present the highly oscillating region and averaged enhancement at large scales typical of adiabatic states in this scenario. For the sake of completeness, we have also considered as initial vacuum states the analogous adiabatic ones studied in Refs. \\cite{AAN2} and \\cite{adiab-LR} of 0th, 2nd and 4th order. For them, we found that they agree with observations if there is sufficient inflation, but none of the adiabatic states considered in this manuscript provides a suppression of the power spectrum, but an enhancement, for the observable large scale modes. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section \\ref{sec:eff-dyn} we specify the (semi)classical setting  and its dynamics by means of a set of effective equations of motion within the hybrid quantization approach. The initial value problem is studied in section \\ref{sec:init-state}, where we consider several choices of initial vacuum state for scalar perturbations. There we provide a new constructive method to select a suitable initial vacuum state. We also consider adiabatic states to different order. In section \\ref{sec:PS-ATPS} we compute the primordial power spectrum at the end of inflation for these vacuum states. We also provide several examples of the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies for the new vacuum state and compare with observations. We conclude and discuss our results in section \\ref{sec:dis-conc}. \n\n\\section{Effective dynamics of the hybrid approach}\\label{sec:eff-dyn}\n\nThe system we will study here is a flat Friedmann--Robertson--Walker spacetime with $T^3$ topology. It is endowed with a spacetime metric characterized by a homogeneous lapse $N_0(t)$ and a scale factor $a(t)$ multiplying the auxiliary three-metric $^0h_{ij}$ of the three-torus. The angular coordinates in this spatial manifold are $\\theta_i$ such that $2\\pi \\theta_i/ l_0 \\in S^1$, where $l_0$ is the period in each orthonormal direction (for simplicity the three periods have been chosen to be equal). The auxiliary three-metric $^0h_{ij}$ induces a Laplace-Beltrami operator whose eigenfunctions $\\tilde Q_{\\vec n,\\pm} (\\vec\\theta)$ and eigenvalues $-\\omega_n^2=-4\\pi^2\\vec n\\cdot\\vec n/l_0^{2}$ are well known (see e.g. Ref. \\cite{hybr-inf1b}). Here $\\vec n=(n_1,n_2,n_3)\\in\\mathbb Z^3$ is any tuple whose first component is a strictly positive integer. \n\nWe will adopt a description of this homogeneous geometry in terms of LQG variables. There, one starts with an su(2)-connection and a densitized triad  as basic canonical variables. However, the connection itself is not well defined in the full quantum theory but holonomies of the connection. Besides, in the context of LQC, we will adhere to the improved dynamics scheme \\cite{aps}. This choice is motivated by the fact that such cosmologies bounce whenever the energy density achieves a universal critical value $\\rho_c\\sim\\, 0.41 \\rho_{\\rm Pl}$ for semiclassical states, where $\\rho_{\\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy density. In this situation, the classical homogeneous canonical variables of the geometry are the volume $v=l_0^3 a^3$ and the canonically conjugated variable $\\beta$ (which is proportional to the Hubble parameter). These variables satisfy the classical algebra $\\{\\beta,v\\}=4\\pi G\\gamma$, where $G$ is the Newton constant and $\\gamma\\simeq0{.}2375$ the Immirzi parameter \\cite{thiem}. We will couple to this model a massive scalar field $\\phi$ fulfilling, with its canonical momentum, $\\{\\phi,\\pi_\\phi\\}=1$. \n\nFollowing the analysis of Ref. \\cite{hybr-inf3}, we will introduce scalar perturbations around the classical homogeneous variables. We will then apply a canonical transformation in the phase space, in order to separate the gauge invariant Mukhanov--Sasaki potential $V_{\\vec n,\\epsilon}$, and its conjugated momentum $\\tilde{\\pi}_{V_{\\vec{n},\\epsilon}}$, with respect to the remaining gauge variables. We will then adopt a hybrid quantization approach, combining a loop quantization for the homogeneous connection, and a standard representation for the scalar field and the inhomogeneities. Since we do not know yet how to solve the quantum constraint, we will compute approximate solutions by adopting first a Born--Oppenheimer ansatz for them, and then additional approximations (see Ref. \\cite{hybr-inf3} for further details) that are expected to be fulfilled for instance by semiclassical states with small dispersions. In addition, among them we choose those ones where the effective equations of motion of the expectation values of the basic observables agree with the effective dynamics of loop quantum cosmology (though we do not know yet if this family of states really exists, it seems natural to assume it does).\n\nUnder these assumptions, the dynamics is generated by the effective Hamiltonian constraint \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:total-const}\nH(N_0)=\\frac{N_0}{16\\pi G}\\Big(C_0+\\sum_{\\vec n,\\epsilon} C_2^{\\vec n,\\epsilon}\\Big),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H(N_{0})=\\frac{N_{0}}{16\\pi G}\\Big{(}C_{0}+\\sum_{\\vec{n},\\epsilon}C_{2}^{\\vec{%&#10;n},\\epsilon}\\Big{)},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mrow><mn>16</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u2192</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03f5</mi></mrow></munder><msubsup><mi>C</mi><mn>2</mn><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u2192</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03f5</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow></mrow><mo maxsize=\"160%\" minsize=\"160%\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01716.tex", "nexttext": "\nIn the last expression, $m$ denotes the mass of the massive scalar field and $\\Delta=3/(8\\pi \\gamma^2 G\\rho_c)$ the minimum non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator in LQG.

One can also consider initial data close to the classical singularity, but keeping in mind that Einstein's theory breaks down there and any physical prediction cannot be fully trusted. Nevertheless, one expects that quantum gravity effects will become relevant there, and the emergent preinflationary scenario can potentially change the traditional picture. This is indeed the case of our model. In the present scenario the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce whenever the energy density of the system reaches a critical value $\\rho_c$ of the order of the Planck energy density.  In LQC usually one considers initial data when the energy density reaches $\\rho_c$. This is so because there the Hubble parameter vanishes, the value of the scale factor is chosen equal to the unit (its concrete value is in fact irrelevant for open flat topology), and the momentum conjugated to the field is determined by the scalar constraint (i.e. the Friedmann equation). Therefore, any solution to the effective equations of motion is completely determined by the value of the homogeneous mode of the scalar field at the bounce, i.e. $\\phi_B$.

In addition, one can also allow for different values for the mass of the scalar field $m$, and then consider it as an additional (homogeneous) free parameter.\n\nHowever, the specification of initial data for the perturbations is not fully understood yet, though there are several natural candidates as initial state of the inhomogeneous sector. \nThis freedom in the choice of initial vacua is tantamount to the fact that quantum field theories in general curved spacetimes do not possess a sufficient number of symmetries allowing to choose a unique vacuum state \\cite{uniq-pert, uniq-t3}.

One can also consider initial data close to the classical singularity, but keeping in mind that Einstein's theory breaks down there and any physical prediction cannot be fully trusted. Nevertheless, one expects that quantum gravity effects will become relevant there, and the emergent preinflationary scenario can potentially change the traditional picture. This is indeed the case of our model. In the present scenario the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce whenever the energy density of the system reaches a critical value $\\rho_c$ of the order of the Planck energy density.  In LQC usually one considers initial data when the energy density reaches $\\rho_c$. This is so because there the Hubble parameter vanishes, the value of the scale factor is chosen equal to the unit (its concrete value is in fact irrelevant for open flat topology), and the momentum conjugated to the field is determined by the scalar constraint (i.e. the Friedmann equation). Therefore, any solution to the effective equations of motion is completely determined by the value of the homogeneous mode of the scalar field at the bounce, i.e. $\\phi_B$. In conclusion, concerning initial conditions of the background variables, we consider $\\phi_{B}$ as the only free dynamical parameter. In addition, one can also allow for different values for the mass of the scalar field $m$, and then consider it as an additional (homogeneous) free parameter.\n\nHowever, the specification of initial data for the perturbations is not fully understood yet, though there are several natural candidates as initial state of the inhomogeneous sector. \nThis freedom in the choice of initial vacua is tantamount to the fact that quantum field theories in general curved spacetimes do not possess a sufficient number of symmetries allowing to choose a unique vacuum state \\cite{uniq-pert, uniq-t3}.

Nonetheless, it is well known that this is essentially equivalent to consider the limit of infinitely large $k$.}. It is important to remark that those adiabatic solutions are suitable approximated solutions in the limit of large $k$ but it is also well known that they do not provide in general a good approximation for small $k$. However, we are not interested in analytical approximations to the exact solutions but instead in using these adiabatic states to obtain suitable initial conditions for our equations of motion. Actually, from equation \\eqref{eq:adiab-sol} one can define initial conditions associated to an adiabatic solution (absorbing an irrelevant global phase) by choosing $D_{k} = W_{k}$ and $C_{k} = -W^{\\prime}_{k}/{(2W^{2}_{k})}$, with both expressions in the right hand sides evaluated at $\\eta = \\eta_{0}$.\n\nNow, we are going to introduce two different procedures that we will use in this work to obtain specific adiabatic initial conditions of different orders. The first procedure mimics the one explained in the reference \\cite{adiab-LR}. One obtains an adiabatic solution of order $(\\mathfrak{n} + 2)$, $W^{(\\mathfrak{n}+2)}_{k}$, by plugging in the right hand side of the equation \\eqref{eq:adiab-sol-W} the $(\\mathfrak{n})$ order solution $W^{(\\mathfrak{n})}_{k}$, starting with $W^{(0)}_{k} = k$ (the solution naturally associated to a free massless scalar field). The other procedure that we use to select specific adiabatic initial conditions for each order is to consider the above mentioned solutions and perform an asymptotic expansion in the limit of large $k$ and then truncating it at the considered order. This method is equivalent to the one used in Ref. \\cite{AAN2}. The functions obtained by means of this last procedure will be denoted as $\\mathfrak{W}^{(\\mathfrak{n})}_{k}$. In the following we will consider these two specific adiabatic initial conditions until 4th order. To show some instances of the functions considered here, obviously both cases lead to the same initial conditions for the 0th order, $W^{(0)}_{k} = \\mathfrak{W}^{(0)}_{k} = k$, whereas for the 2nd order we have $W^{(2)}_{k}=\\sqrt{k^{2}+s}$ and $\\mathfrak{W}^{(2)}_{k} = k + \\frac{s}{2k}$. It is worth noting that it is not guaranteed that these two procedures give meaningful initial conditions (and therefore solutions) since they can lead to functions $W^{(\\mathfrak{n})}_{k}$ that are negative or even complex for some values of $k$. \n\nIn addition, to the above mentioned potential problems of the two procedures to obtain initial conditions associated to adiabatic states, it is easy to realize that, in general, both of them give different sets of ``positive frequency'' solutions when considering different initial times. This may not be seen as a big drawback but it is important to stress that, for instance, in de Sitter spacetimes the privileged Bunch--Davies vacuum is selected by one specific set of solutions irrespectively to the time selected to define the corresponding initial conditions. In summary, these adiabatic conditions allow us to reduce the possible initial states for the inhomogeneities, but from the different definitions of adiabatic states, it is clear that there still exist infinitely many choices of adiabatic states of any order. Recently, it has been proposed a new criterion to select a unique set of initial conditions in the context of adiabatic vacua \\cite{pref-inst-vac-AAN}. The criterion selects those initial conditions for which the expectation value of the adiabatically regularized stress-energy tensor at the initial time vanishes.\n\t\nIn this work we will use a different criterion to select a set of initial conditions.

However, we are not interested in analytical approximations to the exact solutions but instead in using these adiabatic states to obtain suitable initial conditions for our equations of motion. Actually, from equation \\eqref{eq:adiab-sol} one can define initial conditions associated to an adiabatic solution (absorbing an irrelevant global phase) by choosing $D_{k} = W_{k}$ and $C_{k} = -W^{\\prime}_{k}/{(2W^{2}_{k})}$, with both expressions in the right hand sides evaluated at $\\eta = \\eta_{0}$.\n\nNow, we are going to introduce two different procedures that we will use in this work to obtain specific adiabatic initial conditions of different orders. The first procedure mimics the one explained in the reference \\cite{adiab-LR}. One obtains an adiabatic solution of order $(\\mathfrak{n} + 2)$, $W^{(\\mathfrak{n}+2)}_{k}$, by plugging in the right hand side of the equation \\eqref{eq:adiab-sol-W} the $(\\mathfrak{n})$ order solution $W^{(\\mathfrak{n})}_{k}$, starting with $W^{(0)}_{k} = k$ (the solution naturally associated to a free massless scalar field). The other procedure that we use to select specific adiabatic initial conditions for each order is to consider the above mentioned solutions and perform an asymptotic expansion in the limit of large $k$ and then truncating it at the considered order. This method is equivalent to the one used in Ref. \\cite{AAN2}. The functions obtained by means of this last procedure will be denoted as $\\mathfrak{W}^{(\\mathfrak{n})}_{k}$. In the following we will consider these two specific adiabatic initial conditions until 4th order. To show some instances of the functions considered here, obviously both cases lead to the same initial conditions for the 0th order, $W^{(0)}_{k} = \\mathfrak{W}^{(0)}_{k} = k$, whereas for the 2nd order we have $W^{(2)}_{k}=\\sqrt{k^{2}+s}$ and $\\mathfrak{W}^{(2)}_{k} = k + \\frac{s}{2k}$. It is worth noting that it is not guaranteed that these two procedures give meaningful initial conditions (and therefore solutions) since they can lead to functions $W^{(\\mathfrak{n})}_{k}$ that are negative or even complex for some values of $k$. \n\nIn addition, to the above mentioned potential problems of the two procedures to obtain initial conditions associated to adiabatic states, it is easy to realize that, in general, both of them give different sets of ``positive frequency'' solutions when considering different initial times. This may not be seen as a big drawback but it is important to stress that, for instance, in de Sitter spacetimes the privileged Bunch--Davies vacuum is selected by one specific set of solutions irrespectively to the time selected to define the corresponding initial conditions. In summary, these adiabatic conditions allow us to reduce the possible initial states for the inhomogeneities, but from the different definitions of adiabatic states, it is clear that there still exist infinitely many choices of adiabatic states of any order. Recently, it has been proposed a new criterion to select a unique set of initial conditions in the context of adiabatic vacua \\cite{pref-inst-vac-AAN}. The criterion selects those initial conditions for which the expectation value of the adiabatically regularized stress-energy tensor at the initial time vanishes.\n\t\nIn this work we will use a different criterion to select a set of initial conditions. It focuses on the behavior of the relevant quantity in our computations: the primordial power spectrum of the comoving curvature perturbation ${\\cal R}$. It is defined, in terms of the ``positive frequency'' solutions of the gauge invariant Mukhanov--Sasaki potential, as\n\n", "index": 23, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:PS}\n{\\cal P}_{\\cal R}(k) =\\frac{k^3}{2\\pi^2}\\frac{|v_{k}|^2}{z^2}\\bigg|_{\\eta=\\eta_{\\rm end}},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E12.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\cal P}_{\\cal R}(k)=\\frac{k^{3}}{2\\pi^{2}}\\frac{|v_{k}|^{2}}{z^{2}}\\bigg{|}_{%&#10;\\eta=\\eta_{\\rm end}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcab</mi><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u211b</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><msub><mrow><mrow><mfrac><msup><mi>k</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>\u03c0</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><msup><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></mrow><mo fence=\"true\" maxsize=\"210%\" minsize=\"210%\">|</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b7</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>\u03b7</mi><mi>end</mi></msub></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01716.tex", "nexttext": "\nthat clearly depends on the specific solution $v_{k}$, and therefore on the initial conditions, and also in the considered temporal integration limits.

This choice is justified by the fact that other natural vacuum states in quantum field theories, like the Poincar\\'e-invariant vacuum for time-independent scenarios or the Bunch--Davies vacuum for de Sitter spacetimes, are absent of such fast (and large) time-dependent oscillations\\footnote{In fact, for time-independent scenarios this criterion selects the Poincar\\'e-invariant vacuum and preliminary computations suggest that for de Sitter spacetimes it also obtains the Bunch--Davies vacuum in good approximation whenever the integration time interval is large enough.}. They are reflected in the corresponding primordial power spectra, showing strong oscillations in $k$. We understand that this behavior should be weakened if one is selecting a more suitable vacuum state (at least approximately). However, apart from the fact that the primordial power spectrum obtained by means of this method is non-highly oscillating and provides the lowest power when averaging in smalls bins of $k$ for $k > 10^{-3}$ (among the states considered in our study), we have not found yet other strong physical argument to justify our selection and we will simply regard it as a good choice of initial data.

We have carried out the computation employing the \\textsf{CLASS} code \\cite{class} and the cosmological parameters provided by the Planck Collaboration \\cite{planck} for the best fits of both the simple power-law and cut-off models \\cite{planck-inf}. In Fig. \\ref{fig:anist} we plot the Planck Collaboration observational data for the temperature correlations, the Planck best fit and the predictions of the primordial power spectra obtained for the ``non-oscillating'' initial conditions. We choose a particular value of the mass of the scalar field equal to $m=1.20\\cdot10^{-3}$ and several choices of its homogeneous mode at the bounce. We observe that our ``non-oscillating'' initial conditions can explain the power suppression for small angular momenta (large cosmological scales) of the anisotropies of the CMB. This suppression is stronger in those cases where there is not enough inflation, but for a sufficiently high number of e-foldings we still recover the simple power-law primordial power spectrum statistically preferred by Planck. For the left graph in Fig. \\ref{fig:anist} we have used the best-fit cosmological parameters provided by the Planck collaboration whereas for the right graph we use the cosmological parameters for the best fit of cut-off models \\cite{planck-inf}. We observe that the peaks of the baryonic resonances are quite sensible to the two sets of cosmological parameters provided by Planck collaboration, mainly because the values of $\\phi_B$ and $m$ must be accurately selected according to the change of the matching scale at the pivot mode, but in both cases they still share the same qualitative properties. Indeed we have not carried out a rigorous statistical analysis in order to determine the best fit parameters for the primordial power spectrum predicted by the ``non-oscillating'' initial conditions. It will be a matter of future research. It is also interesting to notice that it seems that our ``non-oscillating'' vacuum produces a strong suppression of the primordial power spectrum that is not able to explain the anomalies around $\\ell=22$, without strongly suppressing the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies at larger scales. Although we have not carried out a detailed analysis, one possible explanation is that the small oscillations that precede the strong suppression of the primordial power spectrum of the ``non-oscillating'' vacuum be responsible of those anomalies  if the amplitude of these oscillations is big enough. However, it is not clear to us by now which physical process could be behind it.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\t\\centering     \n\t\\includegraphics[width = 0.49\\textwidth]{ProvDlTT-PL-BF.eps}  \\includegraphics[width = 0.49\\textwidth]{ProvDlTT-CO-BF.eps}\n\t\\caption{Temperature angular power spectrum provided by Planck best fit and the one computed for the ``non-oscillating'' vacuum state for different values of the scalar field at the bounce and the mass fixed to $m=1.20\\cdot10^{-3}$.

Since the genuine quantum dynamics has not been fully solved yet, we have considered the effective equations coming from such hybrid quantization (simply replacing operators by expectation values). Additionally, we have neglected the backreaction of the perturbations to the background dynamics. It simplifies the dynamics and allows us to compare the results of the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches. With these assumptions we have computed the primordial power spectrum obtained for different choices of initial vacuum states at the time of the bounce for the Mukhanov--Sasaki variables. More specifically, we have considered two different procedures to obtain specific adiabatic-like initial conditions of arbitrary order and computed the primordial power spectra for 0th, 2nd and 4th orders. They are in good agreement with the ones obtained within the dressed metric approach \\cite{AAN2,agu-morr}. Therefore, it is remarkable that the predictions of loop quantum cosmology seem to be robust, since these two formalisms, constructed following different strategies, provide qualitatively similar predictions under the same physical conditions. Note that, although we have neglected backreaction contributions and consider the LQC effective dynamics, the effective equations of motion of the perturbation are different in the two approaches mainly due to the way in which polymeric corrections are included. These power spectra show three distinct behaviors at different scales: (i) smooth slow-roll-like behavior (with small oscillations) for $k \\gtrapprox 10$, (ii) large oscillations with an averaged power enhancement for $10^{-3} \\lessapprox k \\lessapprox 10$ and (iii) strong power suppression for $k \\lessapprox 10^{-3}$, except for the expanded adiabatic vacuum of order four $(\\mathfrak{W}^{(4)}_{k})$ for which the power remains large and constant. It is worth to mention that this kind of primordial power spectra, though they can be in good agreement with observations if the most important corrections correspond to scales that are not currently observable in the CMB, are not able to successfully explain the suppression of the temperature anisotropy power spectrum at large scales, without further considerations \\cite{revab,non-gauss}. Let us also comment that, at first glance, neither our results nor the ones of the dressed metric proposal are in agreement with the ones obtained within the \\emph{deformed algebra} approach, that leads to highly oscillatory (with large amplitude) primordial power spectra even at small scales \\cite{bib:def-al}.\n\nIn addition to adiabatic-like initial conditions for the perturbations at the bounce, we have also provided a new criterion to select a suitable initial vacuum state. Such criterion picks up the initial conditions for each mode in such a way that it minimizes the time variation of the amplitude of the Mukhanov--Sasaki variable from the bounce to the beginning of inflation. We have shown that such ``non-oscillating'' initial conditions yield a primordial power spectrum where the large oscillations with the averaged enhanced power are not present, obtaining instead for that range of scales a behavior compatible with the one obtained from the slow-roll formula. Remarkably, it presents a strong power suppression for large scales. Consequently, it may provide a better fitting to the current observations than the spectrum obtained from a quadratic potential considering only the slow-roll regime or from the usual simple power-law primordial power spectrum. Nonetheless, although a rigorous statistical analysis is necessary, it seems that the obtained strong power suppression is not enough to explain the observed anomaly around the multipole $\\ell \\sim 22$ in the temperature anisotropy angular spectrum. One appealing possibility is to consider initial conditions for the Mukhanov--Sasaki variables that slightly deviate from the ones obtained with the considered criterion. Such initial conditions would lead to a primordial power spectrum with slightly larger oscillations around $k\\sim 10^{-3}$ that might explain the above mentioned anomaly. Those slightly differently initial conditions might be obtained by different physical processes. One possibility is, for instance, by minimizing the time integrated (in conformal time) value of the energy density for each mode from the bounce to the beginning of inflation. On the other hand, since we expect that the set of complex solutions selected by ``non-oscillating'' initial conditions give approximately similar physical results to the ones obtained by giving Minkowski-like initial conditions in the kinematically dominated period, another possible way to obtain a primordial power spectrum with larger (but still small) oscillations around $k\\sim 10^{-3}$ is defining Minkowski-like initial conditions around the end of the superinflationary era after the bounce. Indeed, it is not clear to us that the quantum dynamics of the Universe is fully determined by our approach but, instead, there is a decoupling scale right after the bounce where the hybrid quantization (and so the dressed metric approach) is valid and where it is natural to give Minkowski-like initial conditions. Finally, another possibility is to break the hypothesis of isotropy before inflation \\cite{bianchi1,bianchi2}, being the anisotropies the main source of oscillations at scales of the order of $k\\sim 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe assumption of isotropy of the universe together with the truncation of the perturbations to second order in the action allow us to focus our attention on scalar perturbations, since they decouple dynamically from the vector and tensor modes. In these circumstances, the vector inhomogeneities are non-dynamical degrees of freedom. However, the tensor modes cannot be neglected if one wants a complete physical picture of the system (under the previous hypotheses). Although the hybrid quantization approach is still incomplete at this respect, our preliminary calculations suggest that it is possible to incorporate tensor modes in this formalism without further considerations. The effective equations of motion are well defined at the Planck regime and have a well behaved ultraviolet limit. Our purpose in the future is to compute the tensor primordial spectra for several initial adiabatic vacuum states (as well as for the \"non-oscillatory\" one) within this hybrid quantization approach. Although it is soon to draw any conclusion within this formalism, the analyses by Planck collaboration suggest that a quadratic potential is statistically disfavored since it predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio slightly higher than the upper bound $r_{0{.}002}<0{.}11$ (95\\%CL). However, whether this is true in the hybrid formalism and the possible physical phenomena that could deal with this question is something that we will discuss in a forthcoming publication.\n\nOur results are mainly based on the selection of the ``non-oscillating'' vacuum state, which has been obtained by following a particular algorithm whose main purpose is to minimize the oscillations of the primordial power spectrum. But additional considerations can be further investigated. For instance, the quantity inside the integral in Eq. \\eqref{eq:IO} is the absolute value of the derivative of $|v_{k}|^{2}$ with respect to conformal time. Although the algorithm works very well eliminating most of the oscillations in this physical quantity (let us recall that it is related with the 2-point function), one could instead consider minimizing these type of oscillations in other physical quantities like either the total, kinetic or potential time-dependent energy of each mode. Besides, it would be interesting to apply this algorithm to different cosmological settings. In particular, there are some situations where this method can be tested since the natural vacuum state is already known. This is the case, for instance, of time-independent scenarios or de Sitter spacetimes. If we consider arbitrary initial conditions, like in Eq. \\eqref{eq:gen-ini-cond}, it would be very interesting to see if this algorithm is able to reconstruct the privileged initial conditions of the Poincar\\'e-invariant vacuum or Bunch-Davies vacuum, respectively. A preliminary study for a test, massive scalar field in a Minkowski spacetime shows that the algorithm is able to find in a good approximation the initial conditions for the Poincar\\'e-invariant vacuum state. All these aspects will be addressed in future publications.\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nThe authors are greatly thankful to L. Castell\\'o Gomar, M. Mart\\'in Benito, G. A. Mena Marug\\'an and T.
