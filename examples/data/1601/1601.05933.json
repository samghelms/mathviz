optics. \n\nWith the advent of the chirped pulse amplification technique which can deliver ultrashort, intense laser pulses\\;\\cite{strickland}, filament generation in gaseous media became possible for the first time\\;\\cite{A.1995}.\n\nSince the optical power in femtosecond pulses can easily exceed the threshold for nonlinear self-focusing,\n\nthey can be used to study the catastrophic nonlinear wave collapse\\;\\cite{Gaeta2000}.\n\nUnder loose focusing conditions, however,  the onset of plasma defocusing  may avoid the collapse and lead to the formation of longitudinally extended filaments.\n\nSince filaments have highly directional beam characteristics,  they are theoretically described by the forward Maxwell equation\\;\\cite{Husakou2001} or the unidirectional pulse propagation equation\\;\\cite{Kolesik2002}.\n\nUsually, polarization density and current density are plugged into the propagation equation to account for the optical response of the medium.\n\nIn the standard model of femtosecond filamentation these quantities are treated phenomenologically\\;\\cite{L.2007}:\n\nIt is assumed that the nonlinear part of the polarization density is governed by the $\\chi^{(3)}$-nonlinearity, while the current density due to ionization is described by the Drude model.\n\nNeglecting third harmonic generation, the standard model can be boiled down to a formula for the field-dependent refractive index change according to\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eq:stdmod}\n  \\Delta n(t)= n_2 I(t)-\\frac{\\rho

ac-Stark effect shifts the energy levels of the dressed Rydberg states by the ponderomotive potential, $U_p=E^2/(4\\omega_0^2)$.\n\nEventually, a Freeman resonance arises when the energy difference between a Rydberg state and the ground state is a multiple of the photon energy.\n\nThese resonances are usually preceded by a channel closure, which occurs when the ground state is in multiphoton resonance with the ponderomotively up-shifted continuum threshold.\n\nIn consequence, we expect an enhanced population of the participating Rydberg state at a Freeman resonance.\n\nIndeed, above the 9-photon channel closure at {\\ensuremath{\\unit[{5.5}]{TW/cm^2}}} in figure~\\ref{fig:nri_vs_rho}, we observe an increase and successive peaks in the occupation probability of the excited states.\n\nInterestingly, this seems to be anticorrelated to the ionization probability, which is decreased at the same intensities, most likely due to interference stabilization\\;\\cite{Popov2003}.\n\nThis stabilization vanishes for peak intensities $\\ge{\\ensuremath{\\unit[{15}]{TW/cm^2}}}$, where transitions into both bound and continuum states are

states is similar to that of free electrons\\;\\cite{Fedorov1997}.\n\nAdditionally, electrons which are freed during the pulse may be captured back into Rydberg states when the field is gone.\n\nHere, we consider all states above the ninth excited state as Rydberg states since their corresponding Floquet energies shift with the ponderomotive potential (cf. figure~1 in~\\cite{Hofmann2015}). \n\nThe probability to find the atom in a Rydberg state is then given by $\\beta_{\\text{Ryd}}=\\sum_{k>9} \\beta_k$.\n\nThe overall population of excited states, however, is small compared to the ionization

with the exact TDSE calculation~(\\ref{eq:refindex}), for different pulse shapes and lengths.\n\nFirst, we employed the 80-cycle flat-top pulse.\n\nFor low peak intensities shown in panel~(a), the refractive index for both model (A: green, B: orange, C: red) and simulation (purple, dashed) follow the Kerr-nonlinearity $n_2I$ (grey, dash-dotted) until enhanced ionization becomes non-negligible.\n\nAs an interesting side note, the TDSE result is obviously superlinear, indicating that the next coefficient in a perturbative description, $n_4$, has to be positive.\n\nAlthough there is a small deviation above {\\ensuremath{\\unit[{10}]{TW/cm^2}}} between model and simulation, the agreement between the two is astounding close.\n\nOnly for the {\\ensuremath{\\unit[{15}]{TW/cm^2}}} resonance, the drop in the refractive index is significantly larger than predicted by case A and B (which overlap in this panel).\n\nCase C, on the other hand, is closer to the simulation result.\n\nThis observation also holds for resonances at {\\ensuremath{\\unit[{22}]{TW/cm^2}}} and {\\ensuremath{\\unit[{29.8}]{TW/cm^2}}} in panel~(b) which shows the full intensity range on a larger scale for the same flat-top pulse.\n\nAll in all the deviation remains small.\n\nAfter the 10-photon channel closure, the increased population of Rydberg states (cf. figure~\\ref{fig:population}) becomes noticeable in the refractive index.\n\nAs expected, case A (ionization only) diverges from the simulation while case B and C are in good agreement.\n\nModel and simulation astonishingly coincide even for a purely $\\cos^2$-pulse as shown in panel~(c) and (d), where the total pulse duration is 96 cycles ($T_\\text{FWHM}=\\unit[93.3]{fs}$) and 24 cycles ($T_\\text{FWHM}=\\unit[23.3]{fs}$), respectively.\n\nAgain, we notice deviations in case A for peak intensities larger than {\\ensuremath{\\unit[{30}]{TW/cm^2}}}, but case B and C are close to the numerical result.\n\nOverall, our modification of the standard model is in remarkable agreement with the nonlinear refractive index from pure TDSE calculations, manifesting the conclusion that

the optical response in femtosecond filaments. \n\nOur AFR model maintains the structure of the standard model, which is written as a sum of the Kerr-induced refractive index change and a plasma-induced one, where the time-dependence of the plasma generation is governed by an ionization rate $w[I]$. \n\nHowever, instead of an ionization rate derived from Keldysh theory, we employ an ionization rate obtained from non-Hermitian Floquet theory. \n\nThe development of our model was led by numerical experiments which clearly showed that resonantly enhanced ionization has a strong impact on the nonlinear refractive index modifications. \n\nInterestingly, drops in the nonlinear susceptibility or polarizability have already been noted  in~\\cite{Nurhuda2002,Kohler2013,Richter2013}.\n\nAlthough, in the above-mentioned works, the link to resonances was made, the role of multiphoton transitions between field-dressed states and the resulting enhanced ionization was not discussed.\n\nOur numerical results showed that the optical response is dominated by the ordinary Kerr effect and the ground-state depletion, i.e., the plasma-like response of Rydberg and free electrons. \n\nWe were thus led to the conclusion that an augmented standard model may be obtained by replacing the Keldysh-like ionization rate in the plasma term by an ionization rate derived from non-Hermitian Floquet theory -- since in the adiabatic regime, Floquet theory accurately captures ionization enhancements due to multiphoton resonances.\n\nThe AFR model yielded excellent results in agreement with the ab initio TDSE calculation of the nonlinear refractive index. \n\nOur results also seem to rule out the necessity to introduce higher-order Kerr terms, since our modified standard model only contains the lowest order Kerr term $\\propto n_2 I$. \n\nWe therefore suggest that it is mainly resonance-enhanced ionization which led to the discrepancies between the experimental results of~\\cite{Loriot2009} and the standard model predictions.\n\nFor a conclusive proof of our suggestion, though, it is essential to numerically reenact the experimental protocol of~\\cite{Loriot2009}, which utilized a non-collinear pump-probe setup to detect the Kerr-induced birefringence. \n\nThis requires full three-dimensional simulations of the TDSE and offers the chance for a detailed understanding of what was actually measured in the experiment. \n\nA further issue which has to be deepened in further research is the transition from adiabatic to non-adiabatic pulse envelopes, i.e., few-cycle pulses. \n\nAs our calculations have shown, the ionization rate $\\Gamma_0$ from the AFR calculations is not strictly valid in this regime due to smearing-out of internal resonances. \n\nWhile in the adiabatic regime the atomic population remains in the ground-state resonance, in the non-adiabatic case, transitions to higher-lying resonances have to be considered. \n\nAltogether, we expect that a promising path towards an efficient model of light-matter interaction consists of analyzing the interaction in a basis of complex-scaled Floquet resonances. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n  We thank Albert Ferrando, Felipe Morales and Maria Richter for valuable remarks on resonances in the nonlinear optical response.\n  \n  We
