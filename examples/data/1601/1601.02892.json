However,\nsince the grid does not contain models in the pre-main-sequence phase, not all these combinations correspond to existing pairs in the grid. \nFor example, a 1.6 $M_{\\sun}$ model at relative age 0.1 is too young\n to be matched by any model of 0.8 $M_{\\sun}$, which is\nstill in the pre-main-sequence phase. \n \nIn conclusion, we found that a total number of 1087\nbinary systems are possible, and we estimated the corresponding critical values $W_{1-\\alpha}$ for each of them.\n  \n\\paragraph{Step 2}\n\nTo simulate observational uncertainties, the 1087 synthetic binary systems were subjected to a Gaussian perturbation of all the observed quantities \nwith standard deviations of 100 K in $T_{\\rm eff}$, 0.1 dex in [Fe/H], 1\\% in mass, and 0.5\\% in radius. To simulate realistic uncertainties, \nwe assumed a correlation of 0.95 between the primary and secondary effective temperatures, 0.95 between the metallicities, 0.8 between the masses, \nand no correlation between the radii. A detailed discussion of these choices and their effect on the final results, also including the motivations for the zero correlation between the radii, can be found in \\citet{binary}. \n\nAs a result, for each of these 1087 cases we produced a set of $N$ perturbed systems, where the actual value of $N$ was properly evaluated in steps 4 and 5. \n\n\n\\paragraph{Step 3}\n\nFor each of the 1087 analysed systems, we computed the $N$ values of the statistic $W$ corresponding to all the perturbed objects.

To check the effect of the \nuncertainties affecting observations on the (non-)coevality assessment, the chosen observational constraints were subjected to a Gaussian perturbation before applying the \n SCEPtER code. We defined the statistic $W$ computed as the ratio of the absolute difference of estimated ages for the two stars over the age of the older one.

This was already pointed out in the literature;\nas an example, \\citet{Gennaro2012} conducted some tests for nine combinations of stellar masses on pre-main-sequence stars. More recently, \\citet{binary} presented some basic results about the expected\ndifferences in the age estimates of the two coeval members in double-lined detached binary\nsystems, obtained by the grid-based technique SCEPtER \\citep{scepter1, eta}. We found that \nthe differences are large and reach a median value of 60\\% for a mass ratio of 0.5.\n\nTherefore, given the relevance of the coevality hypothesis, it is of paramount importance to set out accurate methods for evaluating  whenever a detected difference in ages of the two stars in an observed system is \n\"too high\" to be coeval on statistical grounds. Unfortunately, the recent literature is quite inhomogeneous with regard to this problem. It is common practice to compare the observed system to sets of isochrones to determine the system age, while the best-fit ages for a single star are seldom provided. In most cases the details of the fitting techniques are scarcely discussed. Moreover, it is common to individually obtain the system age estimates  for a set of different metallicities, compatible with the error on the observed [Fe/H], and then to assess the error caused by the metallicity uncertainty by considering the obtained age spread \\citep[see among many][]{Clausen2008, Lacy2008, Torres2009, Clausen2010, Rozyczka2011,Sowell2012}. The drawback of this method is that it cannot account for possible error correlations among masses, metallicities, and effective temperatures of the stars.\nFor age estimation purposes, stellar tracks for the precise observed masses were calculated in other cases \\citep[e.g.][]{Vos2012}.\nThe literature also reports a two-stage fitting method,  which first estimates the best-fit stellar model metallicity that is compatible with the spectroscopic determination, and then finds the best-fitting isochrone for this fixed metallicity \\citep[see e.g.][]{ Lacy2010, Welsh2012}. \nOverall, each author relies on different methods and different stellar tracks, computed with chemical and physical input that results in age estimates that sometimes are vastly different. The worst problem is that a reliable and consistent treatment of the errors, at least those arising from the uncertainties in the observed quantities adopted in the fitting, is generally lacking, and a reliable error on the age estimates is rarely\nprovided.  This makes evaluating the reliability of the deviation from coevality and comparing the results of different authors\nvery challenging. \n\n\nThe aim of this paper is to partially alleviate this problem\nby  providing a statistical test of the coevality hypothesis  that supplements the currently adopted techniques. Our intent is to develop a reliable method that consistently treats the observational errors, and to show its usage in practice.  To this aim, we evaluate\nthe dependence of the expected age differences on the mass of the two stars,\non their metallicity, and on their relative age\\footnote{The relative age is defined as the ratio between the age of the star and the age of \nthe same star at central hydrogen depletion (the age is conventionally set to\n0 at the ZAMS position).} on the main sequence. \nWe provide the critical values of the expected differences in age to be used to asses \nif the reconstructed non-coevality is simply the result of a\nrandom fluctuation.\nWe also show the differences between the coevality test and the commonly adopted comparison of the age confidence interval of the observed stars. \n\nThe work developed in this paper is framed in the theory of the frequentistic statistical hypothesis testing \\citep[see among many][for details]{snedecor1989,Feigelson2012}. In the present-day formulation, this sound mathematical theory  is rooted in the first decades of the nineteenth century and is mainly based on the theoretical studies of Pearson, Gosset (Student), Neyman, and Fisher \\citep[see e.g.][]{Fisher1925, Neyman1933}. Without any claim at completeness, we recall that the theory requires formulating a scientific hypothesis to check (in our case the stellar coevality) that is often referred to as the null hypothesis $H_0$, to define a parent population on which the hypothesis should be verified, to define a statistic $\\cal{T}$ to be adopted in the hypothesis testing, and to derive the distribution of $\\cal{T}$ under $H_0$. From this distribution is then identified a rejection region of $H_0$; for an unilateral test (as the one in the present paper) this traditionally corresponds to values of the statistics above the 95th quantile of the distribution (the value corresponding to the 95th quantile is called critical value). By this choice the experimenter sets the so-called level $\\alpha$ of the test to a value of 0.05, corresponding to the probability of type I errors (i.e. rejecting $H_0$ when it is indeed true).     \nAfter these theoretical derivations, the test can be applied to a random sample drawn from the parent population to verify $H_0$. The reference statistic $\\cal{T}$ is computed on this sample and compared with the chosen quantile of its distribution. A sample value of $\\cal{T}$ above the critical value leads to rejecting $H_0$.\n\n\\section{Methods}\\label{sec:method}\n\nStellar ages were determined by means of the SCEPtER pipeline, a maximum-likelihood technique \nrelying on a pre-computed grid of stellar models and a set of observational constraints \\citep[see e.g.][]{eta}. \nA first application to eclipsing binary systems has been extensively described in\n\\citet{binary}. The grid of models covers the evolution from the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) \nup to the central hydrogen depletion of stars with masses in the range [0.8; 1.6] $M_{\\sun}$ and initial metallicities [Fe/H] from $-0.55$ dex to 0.55 dex. The grid was computed by means of the FRANEC stellar evolutionary code \\citep{scilla2008, tognelli2011}, in the same\nconfiguration adopted to compute the Pisa Stellar\nEvolution Data Base\\footnote{\\url{http://astro.df.unipi.it/stellar-models/}} \nfor low-mass stars \\citep{database2012, stellar}. \nThe details of the standard grid of stellar models, the sampling procedure, and the age estimation technique are fully described in \n\\citet{eta} and \\citet{binary}, while the adopted input and the related uncertainties are discussed in  \\citet{cefeidi, incertezze1, incertezze2}.\n\nTo test the ability of grid-based maximum-likelihood techniques of assessing \nthe coevality of binary components within random error fluctuation, we chose the most favourable \nscenario, that is, the case in which stellar models perfectly agree \nwith observations and the binary members are coeval by construction. \nTo achieve this optimistic situation, we built a synthetic dataset by sampling the artificial \nbinary systems from the same grid of stellar models as was used in the recovery procedure. \nThe effect on the coevality assessment of the current typical observational errors was \nsimulated by adding random Gaussian perturbations -- with $ \\sigma $ equal to the uncertainty --\n  to the chosen observational constraints. \n\nAs already mentioned, the binary components are coeval by construction\nbecause they have been generated with the same age \nin the sampling stage. However, as a consequence of the perturbation procedure mimicking the observational errors, \nthe recovery might provide two different age estimates for the binary members. \n\nOur aim is to devise a criterion founded on statistics to evaluate the likelihood that the recovered \nnon-coevality is genuine and not merely the result of observational errors. \nMore formally, the null hypothesis $H_0$ for which we wish to develop a statistical test is that the stars are coeval within the random variability caused by the observational errors.\nWe aim to define a statistics to test $H_0$, obtaining a\nrejection region at level $\\alpha,$ and \nthus a critical value identifying it. We define $A_1$ and $A_2$ as the estimated ages of the \ntwo members, with $A_1 > A_2$.

Each table collects -- for\nvalues of the primary relative age $r$ from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step of 0.2 -- the\ncritical values $W_{0.95}$ in dependence on the masses of the stars and their\ninitial metallicity [Fe/H]. \n\nTo use the test in practice, after\nestimating the ages of the two stars and computing the value of the statistics $W$, this must be compared \nwith the appropriate critical value in the tables. If the computed $W$ is lower than the critical value $W_{0.95}$, the null hypothesis of coevality cannot be rejected.\n\nOne complication arises because the values in Tables~\\ref{tab:crit0.1} -\n\\ref{tab:crit0.9} depend on  the observationally unknown primary\nrelative age $r$. The problem can be solved by estimating $r$, for example \nby means of the same grid technique as adopted for age estimates (more details on this topic are provided in Sect.~\\ref{sec:Wint}).  \n\nOur main result here is that the critical values -- and thus the \ncritical age relative differences on age estimates of two stars that are coeval by construction -- are  indeed high despite the high precision reached by the observations.\nThe overall median of the critical values is 0.36, with an interquartile range of [0.16; 0.61]. \nRestricting the test to binary systems of low or intermediate relative age of the primary star ($r \\leq 0.5$) results in a median critical value of 0.60 with an interquartile range of [0.45; 0.65]. \nThis shows a general behaviour, which is that the closer the primary star is to the ZAMS, the higher is the critical value $W_{0.95}$ and hence the expected \ndifference between the ages of the two binary components.\n \nSome trends in the critical values presented in Tables~\\ref{tab:crit0.1} - \\ref{tab:crit0.9} are apparent and easily understandable. The lowest values of $W_{0.95}$ in each\nrow or column of the tables are usually found for binary systems composed by equal-mass stars. These\nare the only combinations for which the relative age of the two stars are the\nsame, all the others provide a lower relative age for the secondary. Since it is\nknown \\citep[see the extensive discussion in][]{eta} that \nthe relative error in age decreases with relative age, it is straightforward to\nconclude that the $W_{0.95}$ values on the diagonal of the tables should be the lowest.\nFrom the same argument it follows that an increase of the critical values is expected farther down in the\ncolumns -- that is, increasing the mass of the primary star -- and leftward in the rows  -- that is, decreasing the mass of the secondary star. \nHowever, closer to the border of the\ntables, the trend is less clear since here some edge effects\n\\citep[see][for a discussion]{scepter1, eta} become dominant.\n\nThe discussed trend of the critical values with\nthe mass of the primary star is shown in the left panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:crit-m1-pcage}. The medians of the boxes increase monotonically\nfrom the 0.8 $M_{\\sun}$ models to those with 1.6 $M_{\\sun}$. The large spread of\nthe boxes is due to the variability of the other parameters, that is, the\nsecondary mass, the metallicity, and the relative age of the primary star.  \nThe strong effect of the primary relative age $r$ on critical\nvalues $W_{0.95}$ is shown in the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:crit-m1-pcage}. For\nlow values of $r$ both stars are at a young relative age, which leads to a large\ndispersion of single-age estimates. Conversely, at high values of\n$r$ we find \nsystems of equal masses with high $r$, whose age estimates are more precise\nand lead to lower critical values, and\nunbalanced systems for which the age errors and the critical values are greater.\n\nFrom the analysis of the tables in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appcrit}, it appears that\nthe effect \nof the initial metallicity [Fe/H] is modest, with a mean variation of $W_{0.95}$\nby about 0.03 for a change of 1.0 dex in [Fe/H]. This explains the choice \nof grouping the binary systems according to their initial metallicity, neglecting  the change in chemical composition owing to the microscopic diffusion. \n\nSome words of caution are needed. First of all, the computed critical values directly depend on the assumed magnitude of the\nobservational uncertainties. \nA larger uncertainty produces a stronger fluctuation in age estimates and thus critical values higher than those presented here. Therefore we calibrated \nthe uncertainties we adopted here by assuming realistic values, which are slightly higher than the average of the quoted uncertainties \nin some recent determinations \\citep[e.g.][]{Yildiz2007,Clausen2009,Clausen2010,Southworth2013,Torres2014}. \n\nMoreover, we provide an on-line tool\\footnote{\\url{http://astro.df.unipi.it/stellar-models/W/}.} that allows computing the required critical value for the supplied masses, \nmetallicity, evolutionary phase, and observational uncertainties. This calculator can be useful when the uncertainties on the binary system observables are larger than those adopted here. \n\nAnother aspect that is worth discussing is whether the critical values strongly depend on the adopted stellar models. If there is no dependence, \nthe critical values we computed here can be readily used regardless of the stellar models used for the age estimation. If the values\ndo depend on the models, these critical values \ncan be safely adopted only when stellar ages are determined by means of the SCEPtER grid. To answer this question, it is not possible to simply use the stellar model grids \ncurrently available in literature because they are too sparse. The only way is to compute fine grids of models covering the same parameter space \nas that of SCEPtER by means of different evolutionary codes. Unfortunately, only one code is freely available: the code MESA \\citep{MESA2013}. \nWe therefore computed a grid of stellar models assuming default MESA input with the following exceptions: solar heavy-element mixtures from \\citet{AGSS09}; \nsolar-calibrated mixing-length $\\alpha_{\\rm ml}$ = 1.8; including the element diffusion with the coefficients by \\citet{thoul94} with radiation turbulence by \\citet{Morel2002}; and the $^{14}$N$(p,\\gamma)^{15}$O rate from \\citet{Imbriani2004}. \nThen we repeated the previously described steps (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema1}) to compute the MESA-based critical values. \n\nThe comparison between FRANEC- and MESA-based critical values is quite encouraging because it shows only small variations. The median \nof the differences between FRANEC and MESA was 0.009, with 16th to 84th quantile range [$-0.002$; 0.032]. \nAlthough a more systematic exploration with other widely used stellar evolution codes would be worthwhile, this first comparison \nsuggests that the critical values provided by our procedure are generally applicable. \n\nSCEPtER age estimates for single stars and binary systems can\nbe easily obtained  from the R libraries {\\it SCEPtER}\\footnote{\\url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SCEPtER}} and {\\it SCEPtERbinary}\\footnote{\\url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SCEPtERbinary}} that are accessible on CRAN.  \n\n\n\n\\section{Comparison of the $W$ test with the individual age confidence intervals}\\label{sec:Wint}\n\nThe classical way to asses the stellar coevality in a binary system is to \nfit the observations with isochrones of different ages and claim coevality whenever a single isochrone is able to fit -- within the errors -- the whole system. \nEquivalently, it is possible to estimate the two stellar ages and their errors and establish the coevality by the overlap of the two error intervals. \n\nA natural question is therefore how the $W$ test performs with respect to the more intuitive approach of adopting the age error intervals to claim system coevality. \nThe purpose of this section is to verify whether the two techniques are equivalent. In other words, does the rejection of the coevality \nby the $W$ test imply that the ages of the single members are not compatible with each other within the errors and vice versa?\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=17.5cm,angle=0]{fig/schema2.eps}\n        \\caption{Outline of the comparison between the coevality tests based on $W$ and confidence intervals (see text).}\n        \\label{fig:schema2}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe outline of the procedure is presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema2}. It required a huge amount of Monte Carlo simulations, lasting for 12 days on a Intel Xenon machine with 32 cores. To reduce the computational burden, we restricted the calculations to solar metallicity; 217 binary systems from the possible 1087 of Sect.~\\ref{sec:sampling} were entered in the analysis. \n\nAs a first step, we generated $N = 5\\,000$ Monte Carlo perturbed systems for each of the 217 possible couples (step 2 in Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema2})\nfor the selected 217 ideal binary systems. We estimated the ages of the two stars for each of these $N$ systems and computed the $W$ values (step 3). For the 5\\% of these perturbed systems whose values were greater than the critical $W$ (i.e. 250 systems for each of the 217 ideal binaries) we computed the Monte Carlo 95\\% confidence interval for the age. That is, for each of these critical systems we generated $n = 10\\,000$ newly perturbed systems, estimated the two stellar ages, and obtained the 95\\% confidence interval on the ages by computing the 2.5th and the 97.5th quantiles of the age estimates \\citep[see][for details]{eta}. The same procedure was repeated for a random set (about 15\\% of the total, for computational reasons) of systems with $W$ lower than the critical values (steps 4 and 5 in Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema2}).\nThe procedure required a total of $5.4 \\times 10^8$ binary age estimates.\n \nThe results of these computations showed only a few systems for which the $W$ was lower than the critical values, but the age confidence intervals did not overlap. We can therefore safely disregard these cases.  \nThis means that whenever the coevality of the binary components cannot be rejected by the $W$ test, the individual stellar ages are compatible with each other within the errors. \n\n\\begin{table*}[ht]\n        \\centering\n        \\caption{Medians and ranges from the 16th to 84th quantiles (in parentheses) of the percentages of non-overlapping 95\\% confidence intervals for age estimates for systems with $W$ greater than the corresponding critical value, classified according to the relative age of the primary star and the mass ratio of the system.}\n        \\label{tab:W-intconf}\n        \\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n                \\hline\\hline\n                \\multicolumn{5}{c}{relative age}\\\\      \n                0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.7 & 0.9\\\\\n                \\hline\n                0.0 & 1.6 & 1.2 & 1.2 & 0.4\\\\\n                (0.0; 2.8) &  (0.0; 5.2) &  (0.0; 9.2) &  (0.0; 14.8) & (0.0; 10.4)\\\\\n                \\hline\n                \\multicolumn{5}{c}{mass ratio}\\\\        \n                $[0.5; 0.6]$ & $[0.6; 0.7]$ & $[0.7; 0.8]$ & $[0.8; 0.9]$ & $[0.9; 1.0]$\\\\\n                \\hline\n                16.2   &   11.0   &   4.4   &   0.4  &     0.0\\\\\n                (9.5;19.6) & (9.1; 18.8) & (2.0; 7.6) & (0.0; 1.2) & (0.0; 0.0)\\\\\n                \\hline\n        \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\nConversely, we found a striking lack of agreement between the two techniques for systems with $W$ greater than the critical values. Only in a small fraction of cases the comparison of the age confidence intervals revealed a significant difference in the two stellar ages. \nIn the vast majority of cases in which the W test allows rejecting coevality, the estimates of the individual ages are still compatible with each other within the errors. \nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, the confidence interval approach is therefore more conservative for the coevality assessment than the $W$ test, and adopting it results in a severe underestimation of the fraction of systems for which the coevality hypothesis is questionable.  \nIn summary, the $W$ test and the confidence interval computation have a different scope of applicability. Whenever the former is specifically developed for the task of a coevality check, the confidence interval computation lack of statistical power when adopted for this aim and its actual level is about an order of magnitude lower than the nominal $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n \nThe results for the 217 considered systems are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:W-intconf}, which contains the median and the 16th and 84th quantiles of the percentage of systems for which the $W$ test and the confidence interval techniques concordantly report a significant difference between the ages of the two stars.      \n\nWe found decreasing trends with increasing mass ratio of the system; while for systems with $0.5 \\leq q \\leq 0.6$ the confidence interval method rejects the coevality hypothesis for a median fraction of 16.2\\%  of the systems that are significant according\nto the $W$ test, this percentage drops to zero for systems with near equal masses. This trend is expected and is mainly due to the assumed correlations in the perturbation step. Systems with $q \\approx 1$ , which are very near in the grid before the perturbation, will still be near after the perturbation. Therefore their age confidence intervals will always overlap.   \n\n\\section{Toward the $W$ test application on real binary systems}\n\nAnother problem deserving a detailed analysis before adopting the $W$ test for real binary systems concerns measurement errors. The empirically determined values $\\hat{\\cal{S}} = \\{ \\hat{T}_{\\rm eff}^{1,2}, \\hat{{\\rm [Fe/H]}^{1,2}}, \\hat{M}^{1,2}, \\hat{R}^{1,2}\\}$ of the physical quantities of the two stellar components \nused in the age estimate procedure are in principle different from the real ones ${\\cal{S}} = \\{ T_{\\rm eff}^{1,2}, {\\rm [Fe/H]^{1,2}}, M^{1,2}, R^{1,2} \\}$. \nMoreover, the evolutionary stage $r$ of the primary star is not observable and has to be estimated. \nOn the other hand, we showed in Sect.~\\ref{sec:results} that the critical values ${W}_{0.95}$ depends on the true values of stellar masses, metallicity, and primary relative age $ r $. \nAs a consequence, the critical value $\\hat{W}_{0.95}$ computed following the five steps described in Sect.~\\ref{sec:method} starting from the empirically \ndetermined values $\\hat{\\cal{S}} $ of the binary members is in principle different from the true critical value ${W}_{0.95}$ computed from the real $\\cal{S}$ values. \nBecause of this situation, the recovered $W$ value for the observed system should not \nbe compared with $\\hat{W}_{0.95}$ but with ${W}_{0.95}$. The true $\\cal{S}$ values are not observables, however, and thus ${W}_{0.95}$ \ncannot be directly computed. Which values of masses, metallicity, and evolutionary stage $ r $ should be adopted to properly \ncompute a critical value that is a satisfactory approximation of the true ${W}_{0.95}$? \nThis is a crucial question; the $W$ test can only be applied to real systems if the correct critical value to be adopted in the age comparison can be accurately recovered.\n   \nThe problem is equivalent to finding the most probable true binary system associated with the observed one, or in other words, a system \ncomposed of two coeval members that maximizes the likelihood of generating the observed binaries after a perturbation caused\nby the \nobservational uncertainties. \\citet[][]{binary} showed that the best solution to this problem is provided by \nimposing the coevality of the two stars in the grid-based recovery procedure. Let $\\tilde{\\cal{S}}= \\{ \\tilde{T_{\\rm eff}}^{1,2}, \\tilde{{\\rm [Fe/H]}^{1,2}}, \\tilde{M}^{1,2}, \\tilde{R}^{1,2} \\}$ \nbe the best estimate of $\\cal{S}$ under this assumption. We therefore performed a new set of Monte Carlo simulations to compute the \ncritical values $\\tilde{{W}_{0.95}}$ from $\\tilde{\\cal{S}}$. To check the goodness of this approach, we tested it on a sample  \nof synthetic binary systems for which the true values $\\cal{S}$ and ${W}_{0.95}$ are known. Then the comparison\nbetween ${W}_{0.95}$ and $\\tilde{{W}}_{0.95}$ will prove the performance of the adopted procedure.  \n\nAdopting the same framework as described above,  we obtained the best estimates $\\tilde{\\cal{S}}$ and \nthe corresponding critical values $\\tilde{{W}}_{0.95}$ for all the systems\nrelevant to the $W$ test (critical systems in the step 4 of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:schema2}). A possible complication arises whenever the two stars have age estimates so different that no grid-based coeval solutions exist, respecting the observational constraints. \nFor these extreme cases the single-star estimates can be adopted. It is clear, however, that the impossibility of obtaining a grid-based coeval solution strongly advises against this hypothesis.     \n\nAs a result, we found that the the proposed estimator of the true critical value computed starting from the most probable coeval \nbinary system associated with the observed one is good, that\nis, unbiased and with a small variance. The differences between $\\tilde{W}_{0.95}$ and ${W}_{0.95}$ are small because overall the median \ndifference is $-0.004$ (16th and 84th quantile, $-0.019$ and $0.018, $ respectively). No relevant trends with the mass of the stars, the evolutionary phase, or the mass ratio were found. To quantify these variations in terms of the level of the test, they correspond to a median $\\alpha$ of 0.048, (16th and 84th quantiles, 0.033 and 0.066).\n\nIn conclusion, the Monte Carlo simulations showed that the test can be safely applied to real systems and is more sensitive in rejecting the coevality than the simple computation of the individual age confidence intervals. To adopt the test in practice, it is\ntherefore necessary to \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item compute the two single-age estimates and the $W$ value; \n\\item obtain the best coeval solution of the system; \n\\item adopt the masses, metallicity, and relative age of the primary stars obtained in the preceding step to find the critical value $W_{0.95}$ by interpolating the Tables~\\ref{tab:crit0.1} to  \\ref{tab:crit0.9}; and \n\\item  compare the $W$ value with $W_{0.95}$. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\n\\section{Analytical approximation of the $W$ distribution}\\label{sec:distrib}  \n\nFor all the combinations of masses, metallicities, and relative ages described in\nSect.~\\ref{sec:method}, the \nGaussian perturbations -- added to the values of the observables before the age\nestimation -- cause a scatter of the values of $W$. The actual distribution of\nthese values ultimately depends on the position in the estimation grid of the\nunperturbed values. Since the grid is irregular and the differences among near\nmodels change with the models evolutionary stage \\citep[see][for a detailed\n  discussion]{scepter1}, it is impossible to explicitly derive  the exact\ndistributions of $W$ for all the examined cases.\n\nNevertheless, we were able to find an empirical approximation suitable for all these distributions. \nIn this section we show that these distributions are closely\napproximated by beta distributions and discuss the validity and limits\nof this \napproximation.

This test allows assessing on statistical grounds \n whether the apparent non-coevality of binary members is merely \n the consequence of observational uncertainties. We also provided an on-line tool \n to be used for real systems. \n\nWe introduced the statistics $W$, defined as the absolute value of the\ndifference between the two estimated ages and the age of the older star. \nWe studied how the $W$ values are scattered\nas a result of the uncertainty on the observational constraints adopted in the age\nestimation procedure.  \nWe assumed a level of the statistical test $\\alpha = 0.05$, corresponding to critical values $W_{0.95}$. \nThe coevality hypothesis is rejected when $W > W_{0.95}$. We analysed the dependence of $W_{0.95}$ on \nthe masses of the two stars, the initial metallicity [Fe/H], and the relative age of the primary star. \n\nWe found that the values $W_{0.95}$ range in median from 0.65 for relative age\n$r = 0.1$ to 0.2 at relative age $r = 0.9$, meaning that the younger the system, the larger \nthe expected difference between the estimated ages of the two components that is due to the observational uncertainties. \nMoreover, $W_{0.95}$, and thus the expected age discrepancy, also increases with the mass of the primary\nstar. The dependence on the initial metallicity is negligible. \n\nWe also verified that the results are robust to a change of the adopted stellar evolution code. \nTo this purpose,  we repeated the process by using a grid of stellar models computed by the MESA evolutionary code \\citep{MESA2013}. The median difference in the critical values was about 0.01.\n\nThe magnitude of the critical values, in particular for systems near the ZAMS, should\nbe taken into account in the analysis of observational data before concluding that the\ncoevality of the stars cannot be accounted for by standard stellar models without changes in the input\nphysics and/or in the adopted calibration of the free parameters, such as the mixing-length or the convective core overshooting. \n\nWe demonstrated how the test can be adapted to real binary systems in presence of measurements errors on the observed quantities. We showed that the true critical values, computed with perfect knowledge of the observables, are closely approximated by the corresponding values derived by assuming the grid-based best estimates of the masses   imposing the coevality of the solution.\nWe compared the performance of the $W$ test in assessing the (non-)coevality of the binary components \nwith the common approach, which relies on confidence intervals of the individual age estimates. \nWe found that the latter approach is too conservative for the assumed level $\\alpha$, meaning that most of the systems \nsignalled to be non-coeval by the $W$ test have estimated individual ages that are compatible with each other within the errors. In\ncontrast to the $W$ test, which is specifically developed for the task of a coevality check, the confidence interval comparison is not statistically powerful when adopted for this aim, and it has an actual level of about an order of magnitude lower than the nominal $\\alpha = 0.05$.\nMore in detail, the common approach gives significant differences ranging from about 16\\% of the systems with a significant $W$ value at $q \\approx 0.5$ to 0\\% for systems at $q \\approx 1$. \n\nFinally, we showed that the distributions of $W$ for the various combinations of\nstar masses, metallicities, and primary relative ages are approximated by beta\ndistributions with appropriate shape parameters. The approximation is very\ngood for systems with a mass ratio higher than 0.7, while it is less accurate for\nmore unbalanced systems.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nWe thank our referee for the useful comments that helped us in clarifying and improving this paper.\nThis work has been supported by PRIN-MIUR 2010-2011 ({\\em Chemical and dynamical evolution \n        of the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies}, PI F.

Each table collects -- for\nvalues of the primary relative age $r$ from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step of 0.2 -- the\ncritical values $W_{0.95}$ in dependence on the masses of the stars and their\ninitial metallicity [Fe/H]. \n\nTo use the test in practice, after\nestimating the ages of the two stars and computing the value of the statistics $W$, this must be compared \nwith the appropriate critical value in the tables. If the computed $W$ is lower than the critical value $W_{0.95}$, the null hypothesis of coevality cannot be rejected.\n\nOne complication arises because the values in Tables~\\ref{tab:crit0.1} -\n\\ref{tab:crit0.9} depend on  the observationally unknown primary\nrelative age $r$. The problem can be solved by estimating $r$, for example \nby means of the same grid technique as adopted for age estimates (more details on this topic are provided in Sect.~\\ref{sec:Wint}).  \n\nOur main result here is that the critical values -- and thus the \ncritical age relative differences on age estimates of two stars that are coeval by construction -- are  indeed high despite the high precision reached by the observations.\nThe overall median of the critical values is 0.36, with an interquartile range of [0.16; 0.61]. \nRestricting the test to binary systems of low or intermediate relative age of the primary star ($r \\leq 0.5$) results in a median critical value of 0.60 with an interquartile range of [0.45; 0.65]. \nThis shows a general behaviour, which is that the closer the primary star is to the ZAMS, the higher is the critical value $W_{0.95}$ and hence the expected \ndifference between the ages of the two binary components.\n \nSome trends in the critical values presented in Tables~\\ref{tab:crit0.1} - \\ref{tab:crit0.9} are apparent and easily understandable. The lowest values of $W_{0.95}$ in each\nrow or column of the tables are usually found for binary systems composed by equal-mass stars. These\nare the only combinations for which the relative age of the two stars are the\nsame, all the others provide a lower relative age for the secondary. Since it is\nknown \\citep[see the extensive discussion in][]{eta} that \nthe relative error in age decreases with relative age, it is straightforward to\nconclude that the $W_{0.95}$ values on the diagonal of the tables should be the lowest.\nFrom the same argument it follows that an increase of the critical values is expected farther down in the\ncolumns -- that is, increasing the mass of the primary star -- and leftward in the rows  -- that is, decreasing the mass of the secondary star. \nHowever, closer to the border of the\ntables, the trend is less clear since here some edge effects\n\\citep[see][for a discussion]{scepter1, eta} become dominant.\n\nThe discussed trend of the critical values with\nthe mass of the primary star is shown in the left panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:crit-m1-pcage}. The medians of the boxes increase monotonically\nfrom the 0.8 $M_{\\sun}$ models to those with 1.6 $M_{\\sun}$. The large spread of\nthe boxes is due to the variability of the other parameters, that is, the\nsecondary mass, the metallicity, and the relative age of the primary star.  \nThe strong effect of the primary relative age $r$ on critical\nvalues $W_{0.95}$ is shown in the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{fig:crit-m1-pcage}. For\nlow values of $r$ both stars are at a young relative age, which leads to a large\ndispersion of single-age estimates. Conversely, at high values of\n$r$ we find \nsystems of equal masses with high $r$, whose age estimates are more precise\nand lead to lower critical values, and\nunbalanced systems for which the age errors and the critical values are greater.\n\nFrom the analysis of the tables in Appendix~\\ref{sec:appcrit}, it appears that\nthe effect \nof the initial metallicity [Fe/H] is modest, with a mean variation of $W_{0.95}$\nby about 0.03 for a change of 1.0 dex in [Fe/H]. This explains the choice \nof grouping the binary systems according to their initial metallicity, neglecting  the change in chemical composition owing to the microscopic diffusion. \n\nSome words of caution are needed. First of all, the computed critical values directly depend on the assumed magnitude of the\nobservational uncertainties. \nA larger uncertainty produces a stronger fluctuation in age estimates and thus critical values higher than those presented here. Therefore we calibrated \nthe uncertainties we adopted here by assuming realistic values, which are slightly higher than the average of the quoted uncertainties \nin some recent determinations \\citep[e.g.][]{Yildiz2007,Clausen2009,Clausen2010,Southworth2013,Torres2014}. \n\nMoreover, we provide an on-line tool\\footnote{\\url{http://astro.df.unipi.it/stellar-models/W/}.} that allows computing the required critical value for the supplied masses, \nmetallicity, evolutionary phase, and observational uncertainties. This calculator can be useful when the uncertainties on the binary system observables are larger than those adopted here. \n\nAnother aspect that is worth discussing is whether the critical values strongly depend on the adopted stellar models. If there is no dependence, \nthe critical values we computed here can be readily used regardless of the stellar models used for the age estimation. If the values\ndo depend on the models, these critical values \ncan be safely adopted only when stellar ages are determined by means of the SCEPtER grid. To answer this question, it is not possible to simply use the stellar model grids \ncurrently available in literature because they are too sparse. The only way is to compute fine grids of models covering the same parameter space \nas that of SCEPtER by means of different evolutionary codes. Unfortunately, only one code is freely available: the code MESA \\citep{MESA2013}. \nWe therefore computed a grid of stellar models assuming default MESA input with the following exceptions: solar heavy-element mixtures from \\citet{AGSS09}; \nsolar-calibrated mixing-length $\\alpha_{\\rm ml}$ = 1.8; including the element diffusion with the coefficients by \\citet{thoul94} with radiation turbulence by \\citet{Morel2002}; and the $^{14}$N$(p,\\gamma)^{15}$O rate from \\citet{Imbriani2004}. \nThen we repeated the previously described steps (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema1}) to compute the MESA-based critical values. \n\nThe comparison between FRANEC- and MESA-based critical values is quite encouraging because it shows only small variations. The median \nof the differences between FRANEC and MESA was 0.009, with 16th to 84th quantile range [$-0.002$; 0.032]. \nAlthough a more systematic exploration with other widely used stellar evolution codes would be worthwhile, this first comparison \nsuggests that the critical values provided by our procedure are generally applicable. \n\nSCEPtER age estimates for single stars and binary systems can\nbe easily obtained  from the R libraries {\\it SCEPtER}\\footnote{\\url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SCEPtER}} and {\\it SCEPtERbinary}\\footnote{\\url{http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SCEPtERbinary}} that are accessible on CRAN.  \n\n\n\n\\section{Comparison of the $W$ test with the individual age confidence intervals}\\label{sec:Wint}\n\nThe classical way to asses the stellar coevality in a binary system is to \nfit the observations with isochrones of different ages and claim coevality whenever a single isochrone is able to fit -- within the errors -- the whole system. \nEquivalently, it is possible to estimate the two stellar ages and their errors and establish the coevality by the overlap of the two error intervals. \n\nA natural question is therefore how the $W$ test performs with respect to the more intuitive approach of adopting the age error intervals to claim system coevality. \nThe purpose of this section is to verify whether the two techniques are equivalent. In other words, does the rejection of the coevality \nby the $W$ test imply that the ages of the single members are not compatible with each other within the errors and vice versa?\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n        \\centering\n        \\includegraphics[width=17.5cm,angle=0]{fig/schema2.eps}\n        \\caption{Outline of the comparison between the coevality tests based on $W$ and confidence intervals (see text).}\n        \\label{fig:schema2}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe outline of the procedure is presented in Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema2}. It required a huge amount of Monte Carlo simulations, lasting for 12 days on a Intel Xenon machine with 32 cores. To reduce the computational burden, we restricted the calculations to solar metallicity; 217 binary systems from the possible 1087 of Sect.~\\ref{sec:sampling} were entered in the analysis. \n\nAs a first step, we generated $N = 5\\,000$ Monte Carlo perturbed systems for each of the 217 possible couples (step 2 in Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema2})\nfor the selected 217 ideal binary systems. We estimated the ages of the two stars for each of these $N$ systems and computed the $W$ values (step 3). For the 5\\% of these perturbed systems whose values were greater than the critical $W$ (i.e. 250 systems for each of the 217 ideal binaries) we computed the Monte Carlo 95\\% confidence interval for the age. That is, for each of these critical systems we generated $n = 10\\,000$ newly perturbed systems, estimated the two stellar ages, and obtained the 95\\% confidence interval on the ages by computing the 2.5th and the 97.5th quantiles of the age estimates \\citep[see][for details]{eta}. The same procedure was repeated for a random set (about 15\\% of the total, for computational reasons) of systems with $W$ lower than the critical values (steps 4 and 5 in Fig.~\\ref{fig:schema2}).\nThe procedure required a total of $5.4 \\times 10^8$ binary age estimates.\n \nThe results of these computations showed only a few systems for which the $W$ was lower than the critical values, but the age confidence intervals did not overlap. We can therefore safely disregard these cases.  \nThis means that whenever the coevality of the binary components cannot be rejected by the $W$ test, the individual stellar ages are compatible with each other within the errors. \n\n\\begin{table*}[ht]\n        \\centering\n        \\caption{Medians and ranges from the 16th to 84th quantiles (in parentheses) of the percentages of non-overlapping 95\\% confidence intervals for age estimates for systems with $W$ greater than the corresponding critical value, classified according to the relative age of the primary star and the mass ratio of the system.}\n        \\label{tab:W-intconf}\n        \\begin{tabular}{ccccc}\n                \\hline\\hline\n                \\multicolumn{5}{c}{relative age}\\\\      \n                0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.7 & 0.9\\\\\n                \\hline\n                0.0 & 1.6 & 1.2 & 1.2 & 0.4\\\\\n                (0.0; 2.8) &  (0.0; 5.2) &  (0.0; 9.2) &  (0.0; 14.8) & (0.0; 10.4)\\\\\n                \\hline\n                \\multicolumn{5}{c}{mass ratio}\\\\        \n                $[0.5; 0.6]$ & $[0.6; 0.7]$ & $[0.7; 0.8]$ & $[0.8; 0.9]$ & $[0.9; 1.0]$\\\\\n                \\hline\n                16.2   &   11.0   &   4.4   &   0.4  &     0.0\\\\\n                (9.5;19.6) & (9.1; 18.8) & (2.0; 7.6) & (0.0; 1.2) & (0.0; 0.0)\\\\\n                \\hline\n        \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\nConversely, we found a striking lack of agreement between the two techniques for systems with $W$ greater than the critical values. Only in a small fraction of cases the comparison of the age confidence intervals revealed a significant difference in the two stellar ages. \nIn the vast majority of cases in which the W test allows rejecting coevality, the estimates of the individual ages are still compatible with each other within the errors. \nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, the confidence interval approach is therefore more conservative for the coevality assessment than the $W$ test, and adopting it results in a severe underestimation of the fraction of systems for which the coevality hypothesis is questionable.  \nIn summary, the $W$ test and the confidence interval computation have a different scope of applicability. Whenever the former is specifically developed for the task of a coevality check, the confidence interval computation lack of statistical power when adopted for this aim and its actual level is about an order of magnitude lower than the nominal $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n \nThe results for the 217 considered systems are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:W-intconf}, which contains the median and the 16th and 84th quantiles of the percentage of systems for which the $W$ test and the confidence interval techniques concordantly report a significant difference between the ages of the two stars.      \n\nWe found decreasing trends with increasing mass ratio of the system; while for systems with $0.5 \\leq q \\leq 0.6$ the confidence interval method rejects the coevality hypothesis for a median fraction of 16.2\\%  of the systems that are significant according\nto the $W$ test, this percentage drops to zero for systems with near equal masses. This trend is expected and is mainly due to the assumed correlations in the perturbation step. Systems with $q \\approx 1$ , which are very near in the grid before the perturbation, will still be near after the perturbation. Therefore their age confidence intervals will always overlap.   \n\n\\section{Toward the $W$ test application on real binary systems}\n\nAnother problem deserving a detailed analysis before adopting the $W$ test for real binary systems concerns measurement errors. The empirically determined values $\\hat{\\cal{S}} = \\{ \\hat{T}_{\\rm eff}^{1,2}, \\hat{{\\rm [Fe/H]}^{1,2}}, \\hat{M}^{1,2}, \\hat{R}^{1,2}\\}$ of the physical quantities of the two stellar components \nused in the age estimate procedure are in principle different from the real ones ${\\cal{S}} = \\{ T_{\\rm eff}^{1,2}, {\\rm [Fe/H]^{1,2}}, M^{1,2}, R^{1,2} \\}$. \nMoreover, the evolutionary stage $r$ of the primary star is not observable and has to be estimated. \nOn the other hand, we showed in Sect.~\\ref{sec:results} that the critical values ${W}_{0.95}$ depends on the true values of stellar masses, metallicity, and primary relative age $ r $. \nAs a consequence, the critical value $\\hat{W}_{0.95}$ computed following the five steps described in Sect.~\\ref{sec:method} starting from the empirically \ndetermined values $\\hat{\\cal{S}} $ of the binary members is in principle different from the true critical value ${W}_{0.95}$ computed from the real $\\cal{S}$ values. \nBecause of this situation, the recovered $W$ value for the observed system should not \nbe compared with $\\hat{W}_{0.95}$ but with ${W}_{0.95}$. The true $\\cal{S}$ values are not observables, however, and thus ${W}_{0.95}$ \ncannot be directly computed. Which values of masses, metallicity, and evolutionary stage $ r $ should be adopted to properly \ncompute a critical value that is a satisfactory approximation of the true ${W}_{0.95}$? \nThis is a crucial question; the $W$ test can only be applied to real systems if the correct critical value to be adopted in the age comparison can be accurately recovered.\n   \nThe problem is equivalent to finding the most probable true binary system associated with the observed one, or in other words, a system \ncomposed of two coeval members that maximizes the likelihood of generating the observed binaries after a perturbation caused\nby the \nobservational uncertainties. \\citet[][]{binary} showed that the best solution to this problem is provided by \nimposing the coevality of the two stars in the grid-based recovery procedure. Let $\\tilde{\\cal{S}}= \\{ \\tilde{T_{\\rm eff}}^{1,2}, \\tilde{{\\rm [Fe/H]}^{1,2}}, \\tilde{M}^{1,2}, \\tilde{R}^{1,2} \\}$ \nbe the best estimate of $\\cal{S}$ under this assumption. We therefore performed a new set of Monte Carlo simulations to compute the \ncritical values $\\tilde{{W}_{0.95}}$ from $\\tilde{\\cal{S}}$. To check the goodness of this approach, we tested it on a sample  \nof synthetic binary systems for which the true values $\\cal{S}$ and ${W}_{0.95}$ are known. Then the comparison\nbetween ${W}_{0.95}$ and $\\tilde{{W}}_{0.95}$ will prove the performance of the adopted procedure.  \n\nAdopting the same framework as described above,  we obtained the best estimates $\\tilde{\\cal{S}}$ and \nthe corresponding critical values $\\tilde{{W}}_{0.95}$ for all the systems\nrelevant to the $W$ test (critical systems in the step 4 of\nFig.~\\ref{fig:schema2}). A possible complication arises whenever the two stars have age estimates so different that no grid-based coeval solutions exist, respecting the observational constraints. \nFor these extreme cases the single-star estimates can be adopted. It is clear, however, that the impossibility of obtaining a grid-based coeval solution strongly advises against this hypothesis.     \n\nAs a result, we found that the the proposed estimator of the true critical value computed starting from the most probable coeval \nbinary system associated with the observed one is good, that\nis, unbiased and with a small variance. The differences between $\\tilde{W}_{0.95}$ and ${W}_{0.95}$ are small because overall the median \ndifference is $-0.004$ (16th and 84th quantile, $-0.019$ and $0.018, $ respectively). No relevant trends with the mass of the stars, the evolutionary phase, or the mass ratio were found. To quantify these variations in terms of the level of the test, they correspond to a median $\\alpha$ of 0.048, (16th and 84th quantiles, 0.033 and 0.066).\n\nIn conclusion, the Monte Carlo simulations showed that the test can be safely applied to real systems and is more sensitive in rejecting the coevality than the simple computation of the individual age confidence intervals. To adopt the test in practice, it is\ntherefore necessary to \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item compute the two single-age estimates and the $W$ value; \n\\item obtain the best coeval solution of the system; \n\\item adopt the masses, metallicity, and relative age of the primary stars obtained in the preceding step to find the critical value $W_{0.95}$ by interpolating the Tables~\\ref{tab:crit0.1} to  \\ref{tab:crit0.9}; and \n\\item  compare the $W$ value with $W_{0.95}$. \n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\n\\section{Analytical approximation of the $W$ distribution}\\label{sec:distrib}  \n\nFor all the combinations of masses, metallicities, and relative ages described in\nSect.~\\ref{sec:method}, the \nGaussian perturbations -- added to the values of the observables before the age\nestimation -- cause a scatter of the values of $W$. The actual distribution of\nthese values ultimately depends on the position in the estimation grid of the\nunperturbed values. Since the grid is irregular and the differences among near\nmodels change with the models evolutionary stage \\citep[see][for a detailed\n  discussion]{scepter1}, it is impossible to explicitly derive  the exact\ndistributions of $W$ for all the examined cases.\n\nNevertheless, we were able to find an empirical approximation suitable for all these distributions. \nIn this section we show that these distributions are closely\napproximated by beta distributions and discuss the validity and limits\nof this \napproximation. This result is particularly useful since it\ncould be used to estimate the critical\nvalues at different levels $\\alpha$.\n\nThe beta density function $f(x,a, b)$ is defined on the interval $x \\in [0, 1]$ and is parametrised by \ntwo positive parameters, $a$ and $b$, controlling the shape of the\ndistribution. The density has the expression\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nf(x,a, b) = \\frac{\\Gamma(a + b)}{\\Gamma(a)\n  \\Gamma(b} x^{a -1} \\left(1-x\\right)^{b-1}, \n\\label{eq:beta}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f(x,a,b)=\\frac{\\Gamma(a+b)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b}x^{a-1}\\left(1-x\\right)^{b-1},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
