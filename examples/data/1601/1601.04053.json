We provide evidence in favour of the conventional\n  scaling picture, where the susceptibility scales as $O(L^2)$ inside\n  a critical scaling window of width $O(1/L^2)$. Our results are based\n  on Monte Carlo data gathered on system sizes up to $L=79$ (ca. three\n  billion spins) for a wide range of temperatures near the critical\n  point. We analyse the magnetisation distribution, the susceptibility\n  and also the scaling and distribution of the size of the\n  Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster containing the origin.  The probability of\n  this cluster reaching the boundary determines the correlation\n  length, and its behaviour agrees with the mean field critical\n  exponent $\\delta=3$, that the scaling window has width $O(1/L^2)$.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{Ising model, finite-size scaling, boundary, cluster}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe Ising model in dimension $d=5$ is of particular interest since it\nis the first case where the model is strictly above its upper critical\ndimension $d_c=4$.  Rigorous results \\cite{aizenman:82, sokal:79}\nestablish that the critical exponents of the model assume their mean\nfield values. Here the specific heat exponent $\\alpha=0$, and the\nresults of \\cite{sokal:79} also imply that the specific heat is\nbounded at the critical point.  Recent simulation results\n\\cite{lundow:15a} also indicate that, just as for the mean field case,\nthe specific heat is discontinuous at the critical point.\n\nIn contrast to these asymptotic results there has been a long running\ndebate over the finite size scaling for the model with free boundary\nconditions. We'll refer the reader to \\cite{berche:12} for a fuller\noverview of the history and stick to the presently most relevant parts\nhere. For $d=5$ and cyclic boundary conditions there is agreement that\ne.g. $\\chi \\propto L^{5/2}$ for a lattice of side $L$.  The\nconventional picture for the free boundary case is that $\\chi \\propto\nL^{2}$. However, it has also been suggested \\cite{berche:12}\nthat the free boundary case should scale in the same way as the cyclic\nboundary case near the finite size susceptibility maximum.  A computational \nstudy \\cite{boundarypaper} of the,\nthen, largest lattices possible supported the conventional picture,\nbut in \\cite{berche:12} it was suggested this was due to an\nunderestimate of the influence of the large boundaries of the used\nsystems.  For systems exactly at the critical coupling this issue was\nresolved in \\cite{lundow:14} where a study of systems up to\n$L=160$ demonstrated an increasingly good agreement with the\nconventional picture as the system size was increased. But, this left \nthe behaviour in the rest of the critical scaling window open.\n \n\n\nThe aim of the current paper is to extend the study of large systems\nfrom \\cite{lundow:14} to the full critical window, including the\nlocation of the maximum of $\\chi$, and give the best possible estimates\nfor the scaling behaviour in the coupling region discussed by all the\nprevious papers.  Apart from the susceptibility we also study\nproperties of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster containing the origin  and \nuse those to estimate both the susceptibility and the correlation length \nof the model.\n\nTo concretize, the predictions from \\cite{berche:12} are that the\nlocation of the maximum for $\\chi$ will scale as $L^{-2}$ and the\nmaximum value as $L^{5/2}$.  The more recent \\cite{WY2014} agrees \nwith these predictions, and also the prediction from \\cite{Ru85} that the \nlocation of the maximum of the susceptibility should scale as $L^2$, as does\n\\cite{Berche2015}, but both are based on smaller system sizes than \nthose considered in the present work.\n\n\nIn short, our conclusion is that the data is well fitted by the\nconventional scaling picture, both for the location and value of the\nsusceptibility, and location of the finite size critical point for the\nmagnetization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Definitions and details}\nFor a given graph $G$ on $N$ vertices the Hamiltonian with\ninteractions of unit strength along the edges is\n$\\mathcal{H}=-\\sum_{ij} s_i s_j$ where the sum is taken over the edges\n$ij$. Here the graph $G$ is a $5$-dimensional grid graph of linear\norder $L$ with free boundary conditions, i.e. a cartesian product of\n$5$ paths on $L$ vertices, so that the number of vertices is $N=L^5$\nand the number of edges is $5L^5(1-1/L)$.  We use $K=1/k_BT$ as the\ndimensionless inverse temperature (coupling) and denote the thermal\nequilibrium mean by $\\left\\langle {\\cdots} \\right\\rangle$. The critical coupling $K_c$ was\nrecently estimated by us~\\cite{lundow:15a} to $K_c=0.11391498(2)$. We\nwill define a rescaled coupling as $\\kappa=L^2(K-K_c)$ which gives a\nscaling window of width $O(1/L^2)$.  The standard definitions apply;\nthe magnetisation is $M=\\sum_i S_i$ (summing over the vertices $i$)\nand the energy is $E=\\sum_{ij}S_iS_j$ (summing over the edges\n$ij$). We let $m=M/N$, $U=E/N$ and ${\\mathcal U}=\\left\\langle {U} \\right\\rangle$.\n\n\nThe susceptibility is $\\chi=\\left\\langle {M^2} \\right\\rangle/N$ while we define the modulus\nsusceptibility as $\\bar\\chi=\\mathrm{var}\\!\\left( {|M|} \\right)/N$.  The standard deviation is\ndenoted $\\sigma$, as is customary.  We will refer to the point where\nthe distribution of $M$ changes from unimodal to bimodal as\n$K^*_c(L)$, or, in its rescaled form, $\\kappa^*_c(L)$.  Recall also\nthat thermodynamic derivatives of e.g. $\\log\\chi$ can be obtained\nthrough correlation measurements\n$\\partial\\log\\left\\langle {|M|^{\\ell}} \\right\\rangle/\\partial K=\\left(\\langle E\\,\n|M|^{\\ell}\\rangle/\\langle |M|^{\\ell}\\rangle\\right) - \\langle\nE\\rangle$.\n\nLet $\\langle S \\rangle$ denote the average size of a flipped cluster\nand recall~\\cite{wolff:89} that $\\chi=\\langle S\\rangle$. We use the\nsubscript $o$ to denote the origin (i.e. centre) vertex of the grid\n$G$ so that $\\langle S_o \\rangle$ is the average size of a cluster\ncontaining the origin.  The event that a cluster containing the origin\nalso reaches the boundary $\\partial G$ of the graph is denoted\n$o\\leftrightarrow\\partial G$.\n\nWe have collected data using Wolff-cluster spin updating for $L=15$,\n$19$, $23$, $31$, $39$, $47$, $55$, $63$, $79$ for a wide and dense\nset of $\\kappa$-values in $0\\le \\kappa \\le 0.92$. The data include\ne.g. magnetisation, energy ($L\\le 63$), size and radius of the origin\ncluster. The total number of measurements range from about $300000$\nfor the small systems ($L\\le 39$) down to $100000$ for $L=63$ and\n$50000$ for $L=79$.\n\n\n\\section{The width of the scaling window and the shift exponents}\nWe begin by establishing the natural width of the scaling window,\ni.e. the form of a natural rescaled temperature.  We have already\ndefined the rescaled coupling as $\\kappa=L^2(K-K_c)$ with the\nexpectation that this will be the relevant scaling.  In principle, the\nlocation of different effective finite size critical points could\nscale with different exponents and we will compare a number of such\npossibilities.\n\nWe used a 2nd order interpolation of the data points to estimate the\nlocation of the maximum for three different parameters: $\\bar{\\chi}$,\n$\\partial\\log\\left\\langle {|m|} \\right\\rangle/\\partial K$ and $\\partial\\log\\chi/\\partial K$.\nFor the last two we only have these data for $L\\le 63$.  The locations\nare plotted versus $1/L$ in Figure~\\ref{fig:barchikcL}.  The values\nclearly point to three different limit $\\kappa$-values.  Based on\n$L\\ge 19$ we estimate the limit values and an error bar by removing\neach of the data points in turn and fitting a line to the remaining\npoints.  Thus we find $\\kappa_c(L) = 0.8763(5) - 1.21(2)/L$ for the\n$\\bar\\chi$-maximum, $\\kappa_c(L) = 0.8742(5) - 1.49(1)/L$ for the\nmaximum $\\partial\\left\\langle {|m|} \\right\\rangle/\\partial K$ and $0.8725(3) - 1.50(1)/L$\nfor the maximum $\\partial\\log\\chi/\\partial K$. We conclude that our\nrescaled coupling $\\kappa$ is the correct scaling, and each of the\neffective critical points scale with the same exponent. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.483\\textwidth]{barchikcL.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{(Colour on-line) Location $\\kappa_c(L)$ of the maximum\n    $\\bar{\\chi}$, $\\partial\\log\\left\\langle {|m|} \\right\\rangle/\\partial K$ and\n    $\\partial\\log\\chi/\\partial K$ plotted against $1/L$ for $L=19$,\n    $23$, $31$, $39$, $47$, $55$, $63$ and $79$ ($L=79$ only for\n    $\\bar\\chi$). Fitted lines are respectively $0.8763-1.21x$,\n    $0.8742-1.49x$ and $0.8725-1.50x$ (downwards in figure) where\n    $x=1/L$.}\\label{fig:barchikcL}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{The low and high-temperature regions}\nNext we estimate the location of the point where the magnetisation\ndistribution switches from unimodal to bimodal, denoted\n$\\kappa^*_c(L)$.  This point will be seen as the effective finite size\nseparator between the high and low-temperature regions of the model.\n\nTo do this we note that near this point the standardised distribution\nof $M$ (i.e. of $M/\\sigma$ where $\\sigma^2=\\mathrm{var}\\!\\left( {M} \\right)$) is well-fitted by\nthe simple formula $f(x)=c_0 \\exp(c_2 x^2 + c_4 x^4)$. The lower inset\nof Figure~\\ref{fig:kcL} shows the distribution of $M/\\sigma$ for\n$L=23$ at $\\kappa=0.76$ ($K=0.11535165$) together with the fitted\nformula. The binning of the data was done with Mathematica's built-in\nprocedures but the results are not very sensitive to this choice. At\nthis $\\kappa$ (i.e. for $L=23$) the distribution is very close to\nshifting from unimodal to bimodal, as is indicated by the very small\ncoefficient $c_2=-0.002735$. The distribution has kurtosis $2.2217$\nand when $c_2=0$ the kurtosis becomes $\\Gamma(1/4)^4/8\\pi^2\\approx\n2.1884$. In fact, it works equally well to simply measure the kurtosis\nand then estimate through interpolation at which point the kurtosis is\n$2.1884$.  All this suggests that the distribution's shape is well\ncaptured by $f(x)$. See also \\cite{lundow:15a} where we apply this\nformula to 5D grids with periodic boundary conditions.\n\nThe upper inset of Figure~\\ref{fig:kcL} shows the measured\ncoefficient $c_2$ plotted against $\\kappa$ for a range of $L$. The\nvalue of $c_4$ (not shown) at $\\kappa^*_c(L)$ is somewhat noisy but it\nseems to converge to $-0.114(3)$.  For a cyclic boundary this value is\nclose to $-0.602$~\\cite{pqpaper2}.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:kcL} shows $\\kappa^*_c(L)$ (where $c_2=0$) versus\n$1/L$. The fitted 2nd degree polynomial suggests $\\kappa^*_c(L) =\n0.8561(6) - 2.52(3)/L + 7.6(4)/L^2$, with error bars obtained as\nabove, so that $\\kappa^*_c\\approx 0.856$. This point then represents\nwhere the true low-temperature region begins.\n\nThe point $\\kappa^*_c(L)$ constitutes an effective critical\ntemperature but its scaling rule appears to depend strongly on the\nboundary conditions. Note that for periodic boundary conditions the\ncorresponding point $K^*_c(L)$ converges to $K_c$ with rate $1/L^3$\n\\cite{brezin:85}, i.e. faster than the width of the scaling window,\nwhich is $1/L^{5/2}$ in that case. For free boundary conditions we\ninstead see that $K^*_c(L)\\to K_c$ with the {\\emph same} rate as the\nwidth of the scaling window, i.e. $1/L^2$.\n\nWe note that in \\cite{WY2014} an estimate based in the kurtosis was\nused, but instead of using the universal kurtosis-value given at the\npoint where $c_2=0$ they hand picked a value for the kurtosis and then\nused the fact that all fixed such values should give the same scaling,\nwith larger or smaller corrections to the scaling.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.483\\textwidth]{kcLinset.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{(Colour on-line) Effective critical temperature\n    $\\kappa^*_c(L)$ (where $c_2=0$) versus $1/L$ for $L=15$, $19$,\n    $23$, $31$, $39$, $47$, $55$, $63$, $79$.

With the onset of the low-temperature region at\n(asymptotically) $\\kappa^*_c=0.856$ we look at the scaling behaviour\nof $\\chi$ at fixed $\\kappa$ below and above this point.  Consider\nFigure~\\ref{fig:chiL2a} where we show $\\chi/L^2$ versus $L$ for six\ndifferent fixed $\\kappa$-values. Lines are fitted on $L\\ge 31$ to\ndemonstrate the presence of correction terms.  The behaviour is\nclearly linear for larger $L$, with the possible exception of\n$\\kappa=0.86$, i.e. above $\\kappa^*_c=0.856$ where we have entered the\nlow-temperature region and have a bimodal magnetization, but even here\nthe correction term is still rather weak. However, higher\n$\\kappa$-values render us stronger corrections.  The normalised\nsusceptibility was also used in \\cite{WY2014}, but there the\nestimates, which lead to scaling proportional to $L^{5/2}$ were based\non much smaller lattices $L\\leq 36$, where finite size effects are\nmuch stronger.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.483\\textwidth]{chiL2a.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{(Colour on-line) Normalised susceptibility $\\chi/L^2$ at\n    fixed $\\kappa$ versus $1/L$ for $L=23$, $31$, $39$, $47$, $55$,\n    $63$, $79$ at $\\kappa=0.70$, $0.75$, $0.80$, $0.83$, $0.85$,\n    $0.86$ (upwards). The lines are fitted on $L\\ge 31$. Error bars\n    are smaller than the points.}\\label{fig:chiL2a}\n\\end{figure}\n\nMoving on to the modulus susceptibility $\\bar\\chi/L^2$ the corrections\nbecome clear and present, even for $\\kappa\\le 0.856$, but never more\nthan can be captured by a simple 2nd degree polynomial.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:barchiL2a} shows this effect. Note also that once we\nhave gone beyond the maximum at $\\kappa=0.876$ the behavior quickly\nbecomes linear again as is clearly seen at $\\kappa=0.92$, which is\nwhere our data end.  Combining all the measured $\\bar\\chi/L^2$ with\ntheir asymptotic values, based on 2nd degree polynomials fitted on\n$L\\ge 31$, we now obtain Figure~\\ref{fig:barchiL2vk}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.483\\textwidth]{barchiL2a.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{(Colour on-line) Normalised modulus susceptibility\n    $\\bar\\chi/L^2$ at fixed $\\kappa$ versus $1/L$ for $L=23$, $31$,\n    $39$, $47$, $55$, $63$, $79$ at $\\kappa=0.82$, $0.84$, $0.86$,\n    $0.88$, $0.90$ and $0.92$.

But, as we can see in\nFigure~\\ref{fig:barchiL2vk}, the $L^2$ scaling gives values that\ndecrease to their limit value for a large range of $\\kappa$, possibly\nall $\\kappa$ below $\\kappa^*_c$, making an even larger power of $L$ seem\nunlikely here.\n\n\n\n\\section{The FK-cluster at the origin}\nOur next object of study is the Fortuin-Kasteleyn cluster containing the\norigin.  This is the cluster which the Wolff random cluster algorithm\nbuilds when started at the central vertex of our lattice, and is one\nof the clusters in the FK-random cluster representation of the Ising\nmodel.  From the FK-model the usual susceptibility can be computed as\nthe expected cluster size, and with free boundary the expected size of\nthe origin cluster will be larger than the average cluster size,\nthereby giving an upper bound on the susceptibility.  This observation\nwas used in \\cite{lundow:14} to give a susceptibility estimate\nwhich was hoped to be less affected by the effects of the free\nboundary, in part as a response to the truncation method of \\cite{berche:12}.\n\nAs described we expect $\\langle S_o\\rangle$ to place an upper bound on\n$\\chi$, but we do not expect them to be of different scaling\norders. Plotting $\\langle S_o\\rangle/L^2$ versus $1/L$ demonstrates a\nsimilar behaviour to that of $\\chi/L^2$.  In Figure~\\ref{fig:SoL2a} we\nshow the scaling at a number of different $\\kappa$-values below\n$\\kappa^*_c$. In fact, a strong correction enters the picture already\nat $\\kappa=0.85$ (not shown in the figure). This is to be expected\nsince above $\\kappa^*_c$ there are additional terms from the FK-model\naffecting the Ising susceptibility, and those are not included in our\nsampled data.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.483\\textwidth]{SoL2a.eps}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\caption{(Colour on-line) Normalised size of origin cluster $\\langle\n    S_o\\rangle/L^2$ at fixed $\\kappa$ versus $1/L$ for $L=23$, $31$,\n    $39$, $47$, $55$, $63$, $79$ at $\\kappa=0.70$, $0.75$, $0.78$,\n    $0.80$, $0.82$, $0.83$ and $0.84$ (upwards).

Now, apart from this fact\nwe believe that there are good reasons for expecting distinct\nbehaviour from the free and cyclic boundary cases.  As is well known\nthe Ising model is equivalent to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster\nmodel for $q=2$. The case $q=1$ corresponds to ordinary percolation\nand $q\\rightarrow 0$ gives the random spanning tree for the\nlattice. \n\nFor the random spanning tree Pemantle \\cite{MR1127715} proved\nthat for large enough $d$ the distance between two points in the tree\nscales as $L^2$ with free boundary and as $L^{d/2}$ with cyclic\nboundary.  For percolation, Aizenmann \\cite{aizenman:97} conjectured\nthat for large enough $d$ the size of the largest cluster should scale\nas $L^4$ with free boundary and $L^{2d/3}$ with cyclic boundary. This\nconjecture was later proven in \\cite{HH:07,HH:11}. So, for both $q=0$\nand $q=1$ we have rigorous results showing that free and cyclic\nboundary conditions lead to distinct scalings. \n\nAizenman's conjectured scaling $L^{2d/3}$ came from the fact that the\ncyclic boundary case was expected to behave like the critical Erd\\H\nos-Renyi random graph, where the maximum cluster has size $N^{2/3}$,\nwhere $N$ is the number of vertices, which would be $L^d$ for the\nlattice.  Again, there are detailed rigorous results \\cite{luczak:06}\nconcerning the random cluster model on the complete graph and in\n\\cite{lundow:15b} it was demonstrated that Monte Carlo data for the\nFK-model with $q=2$ and $d=5$ with cyclic boundary gives a detailed\nagreement with the scaling for the complete graph.  In particular, the\nsize of the largest cluster has the same scaling for both graphs for several\ndifferent rescaled coupling ranges.\n\nNow, the $L^2$ scaling observed in this paper for the origin cluster\ncan be seen as an indicator of the correct scaling of the largest\ncluster as well. This would give a scaling which is different for the\nfree and cyclic boundary cases, just as one would expect from the\nknown results for lower $q$.  In \\cite{boundarypaper} the authors\nconjectured that for every $q$ there is a $d(q)$ such that above this\ndimension the FK-model with cyclic boundary behaves like the model on\na complete graph, giving a partial generalisation of Aizenmann's\nconjecture for all $q$.  In fact, we also expect the model with free\nboundary to follow a simpler mean-field scaling, similar to that seen\non an infinite tree, or Bethe lattice.  The fact that there are\nseveral distinct basic model systems, e.g. the complete graphs and the\nBethe lattices, which on one hand have mean field critical exponents\nbut on the other hand differ on more detailed properties is probably\nunder-appreciated in the older literature.\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n  The simulations were performed on resources provided by the Swedish\n  National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) at High Performance\n  Computing Center North (HPC2N) and at Chalmers Centre for\n  Computational Science and Engineering (C3SE).\n\\end{acknowledgments}\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{19}\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname natexlab\\endcsname\\relax\\def\\natexlab#1{#1}\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname bibnamefont\\endcsname\\relax\n  \\def\\bibnamefont#1{#1}\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname bibfnamefont\\endcsname\\relax\n  \\def\\bibfnamefont#1{#1}\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname citenamefont\\endcsname\\relax\n  \\def\\citenamefont#1{#1}\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname url\\endcsname\\relax\n  \\def\\url#1{\\texttt{#1}}\\fi\n\\expandafter\\ifx\\csname urlprefix\\endcsname\\relax\\def\\urlprefix{URL }\\fi\n\\providecommand{\\bibinfo}[2]{#2}\n\\providecommand{\\eprint}[2][]{\\url{#2}}\n\n\\bibitem[{\\citenamefont{Aizenman}(1982)}]{aizenman:82}\n\\bibinfo{author}{\\bibfnamefont{M.}~\\bibnamefont{Aizenman}},\n  \\bibinfo{journal}{Comm.
