[{"file": "1601.00059.tex", "nexttext": "\nHowever, an infinitesimal itself is a finite quantity (i.e., it is not\ninfinite).  How can it be smaller than \\emph{each finite quantity}?\nIn other words, how can a quantity be smaller than its own half, its\nown quarter, etc.?  There seems to be a logical inconsistency involved\nin Schubring's summary of the definition of an infinitesimal.  The\ninconsistency is identical to the one claimed by Moigno and endorsed\nby Schubring; see Section~\\ref{43}.\n\nIn fact, Leibniz is guiltless here, and it is Schubring who\nmisinterprets Leibniz's discussion of infinitesimals.  Leibniz wrote:\n\\begin{quote}\nI agree with Euclid Book V Definition 5 that only those homogeneous\nquantities are comparable, of which the one can become larger than the\nother if multiplied by a number, that is, a \\emph{finite number}.  I\nassert that entities, whose difference is not such a quantity, are\nequal.  [\\ldots] This is precisely what is meant by saying that the\ndifference is smaller than any given quantity.\n\n\\footnote{Leibniz uses the term \\emph{finite} in his paraphrase of\nEuclid's definition V.5 (or V.4, as discussed in footnote~\\ref{V4}),\nbut here he is dealing with a finite \\emph{integer} $n$ (which, in\nmodern terminology, is tending to infinity), so that $n\\epsilon$\nalways stays less than $1$ thereby violating the Archimedean property,\nif $\\epsilon$ is infinitesimal.}\n\n(Leibniz as quoted in \\cite[p.~169]{Sc05})\n\\end{quote}\nThis passages deals both with comparable quantities and\ninfinitesimals, but \\emph{finite numbers} appear only in Leibniz's\ncharacterisation of comparable quantities, not of infinitesimals.  We\ninterpret Leibniz's reference to Euclid V.5 as a reference to the\nArchimedean axiom\n\n\\footnote{\\label{V4}Leibniz lists number V.5 for Euclid's definition\ninstead of V.4.  In some editions of the \\emph{Elements} this\ndefinition does appear as V.5.  Thus, \\cite{Eu} as translated by\nBarrow in 1660 provides the following definition in V.V (the notation\n``V.V'' is from Barrow's translation): \\emph{Those numbers are said to\nhave a ratio betwixt them, which being multiplied may exceed one the\nother}.  For our interpretation of this, see Section~\\ref{two},\nAxiom~E1.}\n\n(see Section~\\ref{two}).\n\nThe way Schubring uses \\emph{finite quantity} in his erroneous\nparaphrase of Leibniz has the effect of endowing infinitesimals with\ncontradictory properties.  Schubring's erroneous paraphrase is not an\nisolated incident, for it is consistent with his endorsement of\nMoigno's flawed critique of infinitesimals analyzed in\nSection~\\ref{43}.\n\n\n\\subsection{Schubring endorsing Moigno}\n\\label{43}\n\nIt is no accident that Schubring gives a favorable evaluation of\nMoigno's critique of the infinitely small.  Moigno wrote in the\nintroduction to his 1840 book that infinitesimals are contradictory,\narguing that it is impossible for something be less than its own half,\nits own quarter, etc.~(see Section~\\ref{ban}) Schubring endorses\nMoigno's critique of infinitesimals in the following terms:\n\\begin{quote}\n[Moigno] not only fails to use [the \\emph{infiniment petits}] as a\nbasic concept, but also even explains explicitly why they are\ninappropriate as such.  This makes Moigno the first writer to pick\napart the traditional claim in favor of their purported\n\\emph{simplicit\\'e} \\cite[p.~445]{Sc05}\n\\end{quote}\nAttributing such alleged \\emph{picking apart} to Moigno involves a\nfundamental misunderstanding on Schubring's part, closely related to\nhis misreading of Leibniz (see Section~\\ref{s5}).  Without properly\nunderstanding infinitesimals first, a scholar can't properly evaluate\nhistorical criticisms of infinitesimals, either.  Schubring similarly\nignores an important aspect of the relevant \\emph{external} history,\nnamely the Jesuit context of Moigno's remarks on infinitesimals (see\nSection~\\ref{ban}).\n\nGiven Schubring's endorsement of Moigno's claim that infinitesimals\nare self-contradictory, it is no wonder that he should seek to save\nCauchy's reputation by attempting to minimize the significance of\ninfinitesimals in Cauchy's work.\n\n\n\n\\section{Schubring vs Laugwitz}\n\nSchubring's analysis of Laugwitz's Cauchy scholarship contains\nnumerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations.\n\n\\subsection{Were Cauchy's theorems always correct?}\n\\label{s51}\n\nSchubring comments as follows on Laugwitz's work on Cauchy's sum\ntheorem (a series of continuous functions under suitable conditions\nconverges to a continuous function):\n\\begin{quote}\n[Giusti's 1984 article] spurred Laugwitz to even more detailed\nattempts to banish the error and confirm that Cauchy had used\nhyper-real numbers.  On this basis, he claims, the errors vanish and\nthe theorems become correct, or, rather, \\emph{they always were\ncorrect} (see Laugwitz 1990, 21).  \\cite[p.~432]{Sc05} (emphasis\nadded)\n\\end{quote}\nSchubring is making two separate claims here:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\nthat Laugwitz sought to show that Cauchy used hyper-real numbers; and\n\\item\nthat Laugwitz asserted that Cauchy's sum theorem was always correct\n(including its 1821 version in the \\emph{Cours d'Analyse}).  \n\\end{enumerate}\nClaim (1) will be examined in Section~\\ref{s10}.  Here we will examine\nclaim~(2).  Did Laugwitz assert that the theorems were always correct?\nLet us consider the relevant passage from Laugwitz's text in\n\\emph{Historia Mathematica}:\n\\begin{quote}\nRather late in his life Cauchy [1853] admitted that the statement of\nhis theorem (but not its proof) was \\emph{incorrect}: ``Au reste, il\nest facile de voir comment on doit modifier l'\\'enonc\\'e du\nth\\'eor\\`eme, pour qu'il n'y [ait] plus lieu \\`a aucune exception''\n[Cauchy 1853, 31-32].  \\cite[p.~265]{La87} (emphasis added)\n\\end{quote}\nThus, Laugwitz acknowledges that the 1821 formulation of the sum\ntheorem was \\emph{incorrect} as stated, and moreover that Cauchy\nhimself had recognized its incorrectness.  This is contrary to the\nclaim concerning Laugwitz's position made by Schubring.  Schubring's\nclaim amounts to a misrepresentation - indeed a caricature - of\nLaugwitz's position.\n\nMisrepresenting another scholar's work is, in Schubring's phrase,\n``contrary to a style appropriate for a reasoned scientific\ndiscussion.'' \\cite[Section~5 `The Climax']{Sc15} In addition,\nSchubring frequently conflates Laugwitz's position with that of\nD.~Spalt.\n\n\\footnote{Schubring repeats the performance in 2015 when he claims:\n``I am analysing at length the methodological approach of Laugwitz\n(and Spalt), which consists in attributing to Cauchy (his) own\n`universe of discourse.'\\,'' \\cite[Section~3]{Sc15}.  But Spalt's\napproach is not identical to Laugwitz's!}\n\nSpalt's analysis was already criticized in \\cite{KK11}.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Didactic component}\n\\label{s6}\n\nSchubring makes the following three successive claims concerning\nLaugwitz's Cauchy scholarship:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\nthe controversy basically centers on such fundamental concepts as\ncontinuity and convergence;\n\\item\nLaugwitz himself talks about the `essentially didactic components of\nthe infinitesimals in Cauchy' (ibid., 18) (cf. \\cite [p. 18] {La90});\n\\item\nit is in textbooks that we find these basic terms and not in\nisolated research memoirs\n\\end{enumerate}\n(see \\cite[p.~433]{Sc05}).  Schubring's claim (3) concerning `basic\nterms' apparently refers to the terms \\emph{continuity},\n\\emph{convergence}, and \\emph{infinitesimal} that he mentioned earlier\nin (1) and (2).  In his claim~(3), Schubring appears to assert that\nthese terms are found only in Cauchy's textbooks rather than in\nCauchy's research memoirs.  Schubring claims that Laugwitz describes\nCauchy's infinitesimals as `essentially didactic.'  Schubring does not\ncite the relevant sentence from Laugwitz, who states:\n\\begin{quote}\nDas Beispiel gibt Gelegenheit, auf die wesentlich didaktische\nKomponente des Infinitesimalen bei Cauchy hinzuweisen.\n\\cite[p.~18]{La90}\n\\end{quote}\nThis can be translated as follows:\n\\begin{quote}\nThe example affords us the opportunity to point out the essentially\ndidactic component of Cauchy's infinitesimals.\n\\end{quote}\nLaugwitz's use of the singular \\emph{Komponente} suggests that, among\n\\emph{other} components (i.e., aspects) of infinitesimals, there is\n\\emph{also} a didactic component.  Schubring makes it appear as if\nLaugwitz views Cauchy's infinitesimals as being \\emph{limited} to\ntheir didactic role (this interpretation is motivated by Schubring's\ncontention that Cauchy was forced by a curricular committee to include\ninfinitesimals in his textbook).  Schubring further reveals that he\nhimself adheres to such a view when he claims in (3) that Cauchy's\ninfinitesimals are found in textbooks but not in research memoirs.  We\nwill now show that both of Schubring's positions are untenable.\n\nNeither Schubring's view of Cauchy's infinitesimals as being limited\nto their didactic role, nor Schub\\-ring's interpretation of Laugwitz's\ncomment stand up to scrutiny.  Note that Schubring's claim (3) amounts\nto the extraordinary contention that Cauchy only used infinitesimals\nin textbooks only but not in research articles, something Laugwitz\nnever claimed.\n\nWas Cauchy's use of infinitesimals indeed limited to his textbooks, as\nSchubring claims?  Certainly not.  The article \\cite{Ca53} on the\ncorrected version of the sum theorem is a research article.  It deals\nwith a property closely related to uniform convergence of series of\nfunctions, which was the cutting edge of research in analysis at the\ntime.\n\nThe 1853 article happens to deal with all three notions that Schubring\nmentions in this paragraph, namely, \\emph{continuity, convergence},\nand \\emph{infinitesimal}.  Indeed, continuity and convergence are\nmentioned already in Cauchy's title, while infinitesimals are\nexploited in the definition of continuity given already at the\nbeginning of the article:\n\\begin{quote}\n\\ldots{} une fonction~$u$ de la variable r\\'eelle~$x$ sera\n\\emph{continue}, entre deux limites donn\\'ees de~$x$, si, cette\nfonction admettant pour chaque valeur interm\\'ediaire de~$x$ une\nvaleur unique et finie, un accroissement \\emph{infiniment petit}\nattribu\\'e \\`a la variable produit toujours, entre les limites dont il\ns'agit, un accroissement \\emph{infiniment petit} de la fonction\nelle-m\\^eme.\n\n\\footnote{Translation: ``A function $u$ of a real variable $x$ will be\n\\emph{continuous} between two given bounds on $x$ if this function,\ntaking for each intermediate value of $x$ a unique finite value, an\ninfinitely small increment given to the variable always produces,\nbetween the bounds in question, an infinitely small increment of the\nfunction itself.''}\n\n\\cite{Ca53} [emphasis on \\emph{infiniment petit} added]\n\\end{quote}\nFurthermore, the 1853 version of the sum theorem cannot even be\nformulated without infinitesimals, and Cauchy's proof procedure uses\nthem in an essential way, as analyzed in \\cite[pp.~264-266]{La87}.\n\nCauchy wrote many other research articles exploiting infinitesimals in\nan essential way.  An example is his memoir \\cite{Ca32}, where he\nexpresses the length of a curve in terms of the average of its\nprojections to a variable axis.  His proof procedure involves\ndecomposing the curve into infinitesimal portions and proving the\nresult for each portion.  This article is considered by specialists in\ngeometric probability to be a foundational text in that field; see\ne.g., \\cite{Hy12}.\n\n\\footnote{Another example of Cauchy's use of infinitesimals in\nresearch is his foundational text on elasticity \\cite{Ca23} where ``un\n\\'el\\'ement infiniment petit'' is exploited on page 302.  The article\nis mentioned in \\cite[p.~378]{Fr71}.}\n\n\nThus Schubring's claim (3) to the effect that Cauchy's infinitesimals\nappear only in textbooks is not merely inaccurate, revealing an\nincomplete knowledge of the original documents on his part, but more\nimportantly it obscures the fundamental role of infinitesimals in\nCauchy's thinking.\n\nAfter mentioning the \\emph{essentially didactic component of Cauchy's\ninfinitesimals} in \\cite[p.~18]{La90}, Laugwitz goes on to discuss the\ncorrected sum theorem three pages later, starting at the bottom of\npage~21.  Laugwitz was well aware that Cauchy's infinitesimals are not\nlimited to their didactic function, contrary to Schubring's claim~(2).\nThree years earlier, Laugwitz had discussed Cauchy's corrected sum\ntheorem in detail in his article in \\emph{Historia Mathematica}\n\\cite[pp.~264-266]{La87}.\n\nIn conclusion, Schubring both misrepresents Laugwitz's position on\nCauchy's infinitesimals, and reveals his (Schubring's) own\nmisconceptions regarding the latter.\n\n\n\n\\section{Cauchy, Laugwitz, and hyperreal numbers}\n\\label{s10}\n\nIn this section we examine the relationship between Cauchy's\ninfinitesimals and modern infinitesimals as seen by Laugwitz, and the\nrelated comments by Fraser, Grabiner, and Schubring.\n\n\\subsection{Schubring--Grabiner spin on Cauchy and hyperreals}\n\nSchubring's opposition to Laugwitz's interpretation of Cauchy found\nexpression in the following comment, already quoted in\nSection~\\ref{s51}:\n\\begin{quote}\n[Giusti's article] spurred Laugwitz to even more detailed attempts to\nbanish the error and \\emph{confirm that Cauchy had used hyper-real\nnumbers}.  On this basis, he claims, the errors vanish and the\ntheorems become correct, or, rather, they always were correct (see\nLaugwitz 1990, 21).  \\cite[p.~432]{Sc05} (emphasis added)\n\\end{quote}\nThe matter of Schubring's misrepresentation of Laugwitz's position\nwith the regard to the correctness of the statement of Cauchy's\ntheorems was already dealt with in Section~\\ref{s51}.  In this\nsection, we will examine Schubring's contention that Laugwitz claimed\nthat Cauchy used the hyperreals.  In this passage, Schubring is\n\\emph{referring to} the article \\cite{La90}, but he is most decidedly\nnot \\emph{quoting} it.  In fact, there is no mention of the hyperreals\non page 21 in \\cite{La90}, contrary to Schubring's claim.  What we do\nfind there is the following comment:\n\\begin{quote}\nThe ``mistakes'' show rather, as \\emph{experimenta crucis} that one\nmust understand Cauchy's terms/definitions [\\emph{Begriffe}], in the\nspirit of the motto,\n\n\\footnote{Here Laugwitz is referring to Cauchy's motto to the effect\nthat ``Mon but principal a \\'et\\'e de concilier la rigueur, dont je\nm'\\'etais fait une loi dans mon \\emph{Cours d'analyse} avec la\nsimplicit\\'e que produit la consideration directe des quantit\\'es\ninfiniment petites.''}\n\nin an infinitesimal-mathematical sense.  \\cite[p.~21]{La90}\n(translation ours)\n\\end{quote}\nWe fully endorse Laugwitz's comment to the effect that Cauchy's\nprocedures must be understood in the sense of infinitesimal\nmathematics, rather than paraphrased to fit the \\emph{epsilontik}\nmode.  Note that we are dealing with an author, namely Laugwitz, who\npublished Cauchy studies in the leading periodicals \\emph{Historia\nMathematica} \\cite{La87} and \\emph{Archive for History of Exact\nSciences} \\cite{La89}.\n\n\\footnote{The fact that Laugwitz had published articles in leading\nperiodicals does not mean that he could not have said something wrong.\nHowever, it does suggest the existence of a strawman aspect of\nSchubring's claims against him.}\n\nThe idea that Laugwitz would countenance a claim that Cauchy ``had\nused hyper-real numbers'' whereas both the term \\emph{hyper-real} and\nthe relevant construction were not introduced by E. Hewitt until 1948\n\\cite[p.~74]{He48}, strikes us as far-fetched.  Meanwhile, in a\ncolorful us-against-``them'' circle-the-wagons passage, J.~Grabiner\nopines that\n\\begin{quote}\n[Schubring] effectively rebuts the partisans of nonstandard analysis\nwho wish to make Cauchy one of \\emph{them}, using the work of Cauchy's\ndisciple the Abb\\'e Moigno to argue for Cauchy's own intentions.\n\\cite[p.~415]{Gr06}. (emphasis added)\n\\end{quote}\nGrabiner's comment betrays insufficient attention to the\nprocedure/ontology distinction, while her endorsement of Moigno's\ncritique of infinitesimals is as preposterous as Schubring's.\nSchubring indeed uses the work of Moigno in an apparent attempt to\nrefute infinitesimals (see Section~\\ref{43}).  Moigno's confusion on\nthe issue of infinitesimals is dealt with in Section~\\ref{ban}.\n\n\n\n\nContrary to Schubring's claim, Laugwitz did not attribute 20th century\nnumber systems to Cauchy.  Rather, Laugwitz sought to understand\nCauchy's inferential moves in terms of their modern proxies.  May we\nsuggest that Schubring's mocking misrepresentation of Laugwitz's\nposition is, again, ``contrary to a style appropriate for a reasoned\nscientific discussion.''  \\cite[Section~5 `The Climax']{Sc15}\n\n\n\\subsection\n{What charge is Laugwitz indicted on exactly?}\n\\label{s55}\n\nIn the abstract of his 1987 article in \\emph{Historia Mathematica},\nLaugwitz is careful to note that he interprets Cauchy's sum theorem\n``with his [i.e., Cauchy's] own concepts\":\n\\begin{quote}\nIt is shown that the famous so-called errors of Cauchy are correct\ntheorems when interpreted with his own concepts. \\cite[p.~258]{La87}\n\\end{quote}\nIn the same abstract, Laugwitz goes on to emphasize: \n\\begin{quote}\n\\emph{No assumptions} on uniformity or on nonstandard numbers are\nneeded. (emphasis added)\n\\end{quote}\nIndeed, in section 7 on pages 264--266, Laugwitz gives a lucid\ndiscussion of the sum theorem in terms of Cauchy's infinitesimals,\nwith not a whiff of modern number systems.  In particular this section\ndoes not mention the article \\cite{SL58}.  In a final section 15\nentitled ``Attempts toward theories of infinitesimals,\" Laugwitz\npresents a rather general discussion, with no specific reference to\nthe sum theorem, of how one might formalize Cauchyan infinitesimals in\nmodern set-theoretic terms.  A reference to \\cite{SL58} appears in\nthis final section only.  Thus, Laugwitz carefully distinguishes\nbetween his analysis of Cauchy's procedures, on the one hand, and the\nontological issues of possible implementations of infinitesimals in a\nset-theoretic context, on the other.\n\nAlas, all of Laugwitz's precautions went for naught.  In 2008, he\nbecame a target of damaging innuendo in the updated version of\n\\emph{The Dictionary of Scientific Biography}.  Here C.~Fraser writes\nas follows in his article on Cauchy:\n\\begin{quote}\nLaugwitz's thesis is that certain of Cauchy's results that were\ncriticized by later mathematicians are in fact valid \\emph{if one is\nwilling to accept certain assumptions} about Cauchy's understanding\nand use of infinitesimals.  These assumptions reflect a theory of\nanalysis and infinitesimals that was worked out by Laugwitz and \\ldots\nSchmieden during the 1950s.\n\n\\footnote{Fraser repeats the performance in 2015 when he claims that\n``Laugwitz, \\ldots{} some two decades following the publication by\nSchmieden and him of the $\\Omega$-calculus commenced to publish a\nseries of articles arguing that their non-Archimedean formulation of\nanalysis is well suited to interpret Cauchy's results on series and\nintegrals.''  \\cite[p.~27]{Fr15} What Fraser fails to mention is that\nLaugwitz specifically separated his analysis of Cauchy's\n\\emph{procedures} from attempts to account \\emph{ontologically} for\nCauchy's infinitesimals in modern terms.}\n\n\\cite[p.~76]{Fr08} (emphasis added)\n\\end{quote}\nFraser and Schubring both claim that Laugwitz's interpretation of\nCauchy depends on assumptions that reflect a modern theory of\ninfinitesimals.  While Schubring charges Laugwitz with relying on\nRobinson's hyperreals (see Section~\\ref{s10}), Fraser's indictment is\nbased on the Omega-theory of Schmieden--Laugwitz.  Both Schubring and\nFraser are off the mark, as we showed above.\n\n\n\\section{Of infinitesimals and limits}\n\nSchubring claims to distance himself from scholars like Grabiner, who\nattribute to Cauchy a conceptual framework in the tradition of the\n\\emph{great triumvirate} of Cantor, Dedekind, and Weierstrass (see\n\\cite[p.~298]{Boy}):\n\\begin{quote}\nI am criticizing historiographical approaches like that of Judith\nGrabiner where one sees epsilon-delta already realized in Cauchy\n\\cite[Section~3]{Sc15}.\n\\end{quote}\nYet, when Schubring explains the so-called `compromise concept' that\nhe attributes to Cauchy, the infinitely small is governed by a\nconception of limits in the context of ordinary (real) values.  While\nSchubring is not guilty, like Grabiner, of ignoring the role of\ninfinitesimals in Cauchy's thinking, it is clear that Schubring\nbelieves that it is the limit concept, rather than the infinitesimal\nconcept that is primary in this relationship.  A more detailed\nanalysis of such a Cauchy--Weierstrass tale appears in \\cite{BK}.\n\nSchubring's section (6.4), discussing the connection between limits\nand the infinitely small, reveals that Schubring is a cheerleader for\nthe triumvirate team.  Thus, he writes that the infinitely small is\n``\\emph{subjugated to} \\ldots the limit concept'' \\cite[p.~454]{Sc05}\n(emphasis added); furthermore, ``the \\emph{infiniment petits}\nrepresent only a subconcept of the \\emph{limite} concept in Cauchy's\ntextbooks'' \\cite[p.~455]{Sc05}.  Both claims seem to be based on\nCauchy's remark that ``a variable of this type has zero as a limit.''\nHowever, this comment in Cauchy is not truly a part of the definition\nof an infinitesimal, but rather a consequence of the definition which\nprecedes it.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Indivisibles banned by the Jesuits}\n\\label{ban}\n\nMost scholars agree that infinitesimal analysis was a natural\noutgrowth of the indivisibilist techniques as developed by Galileo and\nCavalieri, and in fact Galileo's work may be closer to the\ninfinitesimal techniques of their contemporary Kepler.\n\n\\footnote{Note that the term \\emph{infinitesimal} itself was not\ncoined until the 1670s, by either Mercator or Leibniz; see\n\\cite[p.~63]{Le99}.}\n\nIndivisibles were perceived as a theological threat and opposed on\ndoctrinal grounds in the 17th century \\cite{Fe03}.  The opposition was\nspearheaded by clerics and more specifically by the Jesuits.  Tracts\nopposing indivisibles were composed by Jesuits Paul Guldin, Mario\nBettini, and Andr\\'e Tacquet \\cite[p.~291]{Re87}.  P.~Mancosu writes:\n\\begin{quote}\nGuldin is taking Cavalieri to be composing the continuum out of\nindivisibles, a position rejected by the Aristotelian orthodoxy as\nhaving atomistic implications. \\ldots{} Against Cavalieri's\nproposition that ``all the lines\" and ``all the planes\" are magnitudes\n- they admit of ratios - Guldin argues that ``all the lines \\ldots{}\nof both figures are infinite; but an infinite has no proportion or\nratio to another infinite.\"  \\cite[p.~54]{Ma96}\n\\end{quote}\nTacquet for his part declared that the method of indivisibles ``makes\nwar upon geometry to such an extent, that if it is not to destroy it,\nit must itself be destroyed.'' \\cite{Al14}\n\nIn 1632 (the year Galileo was summoned to stand trial over\nheliocentrism) the Society's Revisors General led by Jacob Bidermann\nbanned teaching indivisibles in their colleges \\cite{Fe90},\n\\cite[p.~198]{Fe92}.  Referring to this ban, Feingold notes:\n\\begin{quote}\nSix months later, General Vitelleschi formulated his strong opposition\nto mathematical atomism in a letter he dispatched to Ignace Cappon in\nDole: ``As regards the opinion on \\emph{quantity made up of\nindivisibles}, I have already written to the Provinces many times that\nit is in no way approved by me and up to now I have allowed nobody to\npropose it or defend it. If it has ever been explained or defended, it\nwas done without my knowledge. Rather, I demonstrated clearly to\nCardinal Giovanni de Lugo himself that I did not wish our members to\ntreat or disseminate that opinion.''  \\cite[p.~28-29]{Fe03} (emphasis\nadded)\n\\end{quote}\nIndivisibles were placed on the Society's list of \\emph{permanently}\nbanned doctrines in 1651 \\cite{He96}.  In the 18th century, most\nJesuit mathematicians adhered to the methods of Euclidean geometry (to\nthe exclusion of the new infinitesimal methods):\n\\begin{quote}\n\\ldots le grand nombre des math\\'ematiciens de [l'Ordre] resta\njusqu'\\`a la fin du XVIII$^e$ si\\`ecle profond\\'ement attach\\'e aux\nm\\'ethodes euclidiennes.  \\cite[p.~77]{Bo27}\n\\end{quote}\nEchoes of such bans were still heard in the 19th century.  Thus, in\n1840, Moigno wrote:\n\\begin{quote}\nIn effect, either these magnitudes, smaller than any \\emph{given}\nmagnitude, still have substance and are \\emph{divisible}, or they are\nsimple and \\emph{indivisible}: in the first case their existence is a\nchimera,\n\n\\footnote{Moigno's \\emph{chimerical} anti-infinitesimal thread has not\nremained without modern French adherents; see \\cite{KKM}.}\n\nsince, necessarily greater than \\emph{their half, their quarter},\netc., they are not actually less than any \\emph{given} magnitude; in\nthe second hypothesis, they are no longer mathematical magnitudes, but\ntake on this quality, this would renounce the idea of the continuum\ndivisible to infinity, a necessary and fundamental point of departure\nof all the mathematical sciences \\ldots{} (as quoted in\n\\cite[p.~456]{Sc05}) [emphasis added]\n\\end{quote}\nIt is to be noted that Moigno formulates his objections to\ninfinitesimals specifically in the terminology of\nindivisible/divisible which had been obsolete for nearly two\ncenturies.  Moigno saw a contradiction where there is none.  Indeed,\nan infinitesimal is smaller than any \\emph{assignable}, or\n\\emph{given} magnitude; and has been so at least since Leibniz.\n\n\\footnote{Leibniz's dichotomy between assignable and inassignable\nquantity, on which his concept of infinitesimal was based, finds a\nrigorous mathematical treatment in the hyperreal number system (where\nan assignable number is a standard real number).  Yet the mathematics\nof earlier times allowed an adequate intuitive understanding of the\nissue, sufficient to effectively and fruitfully use infinitesimals in\nmathematical practice, even though a semantic base (accounting for the\nontology of a number) acceptable by modern standards was as yet\nunavailable.  For further details on Leibniz's theoretical strategy in\ndealing with infinitesimals see \\cite{KS2}, \\cite{KS1}, \\cite{SK}.}\n\nThus, infinitesimals need not be less than ``their half, their\nquarter, etc.,'' because the latter are not given/assignable.\n\nIn fact, Moigno's dichotomy is reminiscient of the dichotomy contained\nin a critique of Galileo's indivisibles penned by Moigno's fellow\nJesuit Orazio Grassi some three centuries earlier.  P.~Redondi\nsummarizes it as follows:\n\\begin{quote}\nAs for light - composed according to Galileo of indivisible atoms,\nmore mathematical than physical - in this case, logical contradictions\narise.  Such indivisible atoms must be finite or infinite.  if they\nare finite, mathematical difficulties would arise.  If they are\ninfinite, one runs into all the paradoxes of the separation to\ninfinity which had already caused Aristotle to discard the atomist\ntheory \\ldots{} \\cite[p.~196]{Re87}.\n\\end{quote}\nThis criticism appeared in the first edition of Grassi's book\n\\emph{Ratio ponderum librae et simbellae}, published in Paris in 1626.\nAccording to Redondi, this criticism of Grassi's\n\\begin{quote}\nexhumed a discounted argument, copied word-for-word from almost any\nscholastic philosophy textbook. \\ldots{} The Jesuit mathematician\n[Paul] Guldin, great opponent of the geometry of indivisibles, and an\nexcellent Roman friend of [Orazio] Grassi, must have dissuaded him\nfrom repeating such obvious objections.  Thus the second edition of\nthe \\emph{Ratio}, the Neapolitan edition of 1627, omitted as\nsuperfluous the whole section on indivisibles.  \\cite[p.~197]{Re87}.\n\\end{quote}\nAlas, unlike Father Grassi, Father Moigno had no Paul Guldin to\ndissuade him.  Schubring fails to take into account the pertinent\nJesuit background of Moigno's rhetorical flourishes against\ninfinitesimals.  Schubring's endorsement (see Section~\\ref{43}) of\nMoigno's myopic anti-infinitesimal stance is nothing short of comical.\n\nWhile we agree with Schubring on the importance of considering\ncontext, we observe that he fails to consider the Jesuit context of\nMoigno's flawed critique.  Schubring seeks to exploit Moigno's\n\\emph{text} in trying to prove a point about Cauchy.  However,\nescaping the need of a genuine hermeneutic effort, Schubring ignores\nthe \\emph{context} of Moigno's still being a Jesuit at the time he\nwrote his 1840 \\emph{text}.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Gilain on records from the Ecole}\n\nCauchy wrote in the introduction to his 1821 \\emph{Cours d'Analyse}:\n\\begin{quote}\nIn speaking of the continuity of functions, I could not dispense with\na treatment of the principal properties of infinitely small\nquantities, properties which serve as the foundation of the\ninfinitesimal calculus. (translation from \\cite{BS})\n\\end{quote}\nWhen Cauchy writes that he was unable to dispense with infinitesimals,\nwas he complaining about being forced to teach infinitesimals, or was\nhe emphasizing the crucial importance of infinitesimals?\n\\cite[p.~436]{Sc05} asserts that Cauchy is complaining.  Schubring\nbases his claim on the \\emph{context} of Gilain's analysis of teaching\nrecords from the \\emph{Ecole} in \\cite{Gi89}.  However, Gilain makes\nthe following points:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\nUnlike Cauchy's later textbooks, his 1821 book was not commissioned by\nthe \\emph{Ecole} but was rather written upon the personal request of\nLaplace and Poisson.\n\\item\nWhen the portion of the curriculum devoted to \\emph{Analyse\nAlg\\'ebrique} was reduced in 1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the\ntopic of continuous functions [and therefore also the topic of\ninfinitesimals exploited in Cauchy's definition of continuity] at the\nbeginning of the Differential Calculus.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThus, Gilain writes:\n\\begin{quote}\n\\ldots rien ne montre, dans les documents utilis\\'es, qu'il y ait eu\nune hostilit\\'e de principe de la part de Cauchy \\`a la suppression de\nl'analyse alg\\'ebrique, en tant que partie autonome situ\\'ee au\nd\\'ebut du cours d'analyse.  Ce qui lui importait, par contre,\nc'\\'etait la pr\\'esence de plusieurs articles de cette partie, et les\nm\\'ethodes utilis\\'ees pour les pr\\'esenter. \\ldots{} Notons, sur deux\npoints importants pour Cauchy, que les fonctions continues sont\nplac\\'ees au d\\'ebut du calcul diff\\'erentiel et que l'\\'etude de la\nconvergence des s\\'eries trouve sa place au voisinage de la formule de\nTaylor, dans le calcul diff\\'erentiel et int\\'egral.\n\n\\footnote{Translation: ``Nothing indicates, in the documents used, any\nprincipled hostility on the part of Cauchy to the elimination of\nalgebraic analysis as an autonomous part placed at the beginning of\nthe analysis course.  What was important to him, on the other hand,\nwas the presence of several items from this part, and the methods used\nin presenting them. \\ldots{} Note two particular points important to\nCauchy, namely that continuous functions be placed at the beginning of\ndifferential calculus, and that the study of the convergence of series\nshould find its place in the vicinity of Taylor's formula, in\ndifferential and integral calculus.''}\n\n\\cite[end of \\S\\,131]{Gi89}\n\\end{quote}\n\nThe fact that Cauchy insisted on retaining continuity/infinitesimals\nin 1825, as Gilain documents, indicates that the importance of\ninfinitesimals to Cauchy goes beyond their pedagogical value.  Also,\nthe fact that the \\emph{Cours d'Analyse} was written on personal\nrequest from Poisson and others, rather than being commissioned by the\n\\emph{Ecole}, indicates that the pressures of the type Schubring\nclaims are unlikely to have played a role in the writing of this\nparticular book.\n\nLater texts were indeed commissioned by the \\emph{Ecole}, but in 1821\nCauchy was free to write as he felt, and he felt that infinitesimals\nwere of crucial importance for analysis.  In painting a dim picture of\nCauchy's attitude toward infinitesimals, Schubring misjudges the\nhistorical \\emph{context} of the \\emph{Cours d'Analyse} and ignores\nthe fact that decades after finishing his teaching stint at the\n\\emph{Ecole}, Cauchy exploits infinitesimals in an essential way in\nhis research article \\cite{Ca53}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nShoddy scholarship sometimes parades under the dual banner of\n\\emph{sophisticated historiographic analysis} and \\emph{genuine\nhermeneutical effort}.  As we have shown, Schubring's ``sophisticated\nhistoriographical analysis\" \\cite[Section 5 `The Climax']{Sc15}\ncollapses in the face of simple historical facts and straightforward\nmathematical arguments.  Moreover, Schubring's repeated\nmisrepresentation of Laugwitz's position is indeed ``contrary to a\nstyle appropriate for a reasoned scientific discussion.''

The author,\nG.

Here we defend our original analysis of\nvarious misconceptions and misinterpretations concerning the history\nof infinitesimals and, in particular, the role of infinitesimals in\nCauchy's mathematics.  We show that Schubring misinterprets Proclus,\nLeibniz, and Klein on non-Archimedean issues, ignores the Jesuit\n\\emph{context} of Moigno's flawed critique of infinitesimals, and\nmisrepresents, to the point of caricature, the pioneering Cauchy\nscholarship of D.~Laugwitz.\n\nKeywords: Archimedean axiom, Cauchy, Felix Klein, horn-angle,\ninfinitesimal, Leibniz, ontology, procedure\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\nIn our article \\cite{BKS} in the \\emph{Foundations of Science}, we\nsought to place Cauchy's work within an uninterrupted line of an\ninfinitesimalist tradition, and to vindicate his infinitesimal\ndefinitions of concepts like continuity, convergence, and the Dirac\ndelta function (see also \\cite{KT}).  We also sought to champion the\npioneering work of D.~Laugwitz from the 1980s that challenges the\nreceived views on Cauchy as a precursor of the Weierstrassian\n\\emph{epsilontik}.  We developed an approach to the history of\nanalysis as evolving along separate, and sometimes competing, tracks.\nThese are the A-track, based upon an Archimedean continuum; and\nB-track, based upon what we called a Bernoullian (i.e.,\ninfinitesimal-enriched) continuum.\n\n\\subsection{Punctiform and non-punctiform continua}\n\nHistorians often view the work in analysis from the 17th to the middle\nof the 19th century as rooted in a background notion of continuum that\nis not punctiform.  This necessarily creates a tension with modern,\npunctiform theories of the continuum, be it the A-type set-theoretic\ncontinuum as developed by Cantor, Dedekind, Weierstrass, and others,\nor a B-type continuum as developed by Hewitt, {\\L}o{\\'s}, Robinson, and\nothers.  How can one escape a trap of presentism in interpreting the\npast from the viewpoint of set-theoretic foundations commonly accepted\ntoday, whether of type A or B?  \n\nIn analyzing Cauchy's work one must be careful to distinguish between\nits \\emph{syntactic} aspects, i.e., procedures and inferential moves,\non the one hand, and \\emph{semantic} aspects related to the actual\nconstruction of the entities such as points of the continuum, i.e.,\nissues of the \\emph{ontology} of mathematical entities such as points.\nWe found that in his work on Cauchy, Laugwitz was careful not to\nattribute modern set-theoretic constructions to work dating from\nbefore the heroic 1870s, and focused instead of Cauchy's procedures\n(see also Section~\\ref{s55}).\n\n\\subsection{Rebuttals}\n\nIn keeping with its tradition of fostering informed debate,\n\\emph{Foundations of Science} recently published a response to a\nportion of our essay.  The author, G.~Schubring, argues that our\nattempt to show that Cauchy is part of a long infinitesimalist\ntradition confuses \\emph{text} with \\emph{context} and thereby\nmisunderstands the significance of Cauchy's use of infinitesimals.\nSchubring urges, instead, that Cauchy's intentions must be\n``reconstructed according to the contemporary conceptual horizon of\nthe related conceptual fields'' \\cite[Section~3]{Sc15}.\n\nHe further insinuates that our analysis is ``contrary to a style\nappropriate for a reasoned scientific discussion'' (ibid., Section~5).\n\n\nWe grant that we dealt too briefly with Schubring's treatment of\nCauchy.  Here we develop more fully our thesis that the book\n\\emph{Conflicts} \\cite{Sc05}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\nmisinterprets both Leibniz and Felix Klein on infinitesimals;\n\\item\nescapes the need of a genuine hermeneutical effort by ignoring the\nhistorical \\emph{context} of Moigno's flawed critique of\ninfinitesimals;\n\\item\nunderestimates the role of infinitesimals in Cauchy's work;\n\\item\n misrepresents Laugwitz's Cauchy scholarship, e.g., by alleging that\n Laugwitz tried to ``prove'' that Cauchy used hyper-real numbers; and\n\\item conflates Laugwitz's analysis with D.~Spalt's.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe issue of modern interpretation of historical mathematics is a deep\nand important one.  Much recent scholarship has argued that modern\nconceptions shed little light on historical mathematics.  For example,\nscholars have criticized late 19th and early 20th century attempts to\nattribute a geometrical algebra to Euclid's Elements (e.g., Szabo\n1969, Unguru 1975 and 1979).  More recently the nonsequiturs and\nunwarranted assumptions of these critiques have been brought to light\n\\cite{Bl16}, and the present article attempts to accomplish something\nsimilar.  It continues a program of re-evaluation of the history of\nmathematical analysis undertaken in \\cite{BKS}, \\cite{B11},\n\\cite{Ba14}, and other texts.  Thus, we highlight the significance of\nSimon Stevin's approach to undending decimals in \\cite{KK12b}.  The\ntext \\cite{KSS13} re-evaluates Fermat's contribution to the genesis of\nthe infinitesimal calculus via his technique of \\emph{adequality}.\nThe articles \\cite{KS2}, \\cite{KS1}, and \\cite{SK} argue that\nLeibniz's theoretical strategy for dealing with infinitesimals was\nmore soundly based than critiques by George Berkeley and others.\nEuler's infinitesimal analysis is defended against A-track re-writings\nin the articles \\cite{KKKS} and \\cite{Ba16} .  Cauchy's infinitesimal\nlegacy is championed in the articles \\cite{KK11}, \\cite{BK},\n\\cite{KK12a}, \\cite{TK}.\n\n\n\\section{Conceptual horizons}\n\nSchubring has repeatedly emphasized the importance of context and\nexternal history (as opposed to what he calls \\emph{immanent\nhistory}).  We may agree with Schubring that\n\\begin{quote}\nThe meaning [of Cauchy's infinitesimals] has to be reconstructed\naccording to the contemporary conceptual horizon of the related\nconceptual fields. Thus, a genuine hermeneutical effort is\ninescapable.  \\cite[Section~3]{Sc15}\n\\end{quote}\nIndeed, Cauchy's \\emph{contemporary conceptual horizon} needs to be\ntaken into account.  However, it is equally true that the meaning of\nCauchy's infinitesimals cannot be reconstructed, as Schubring attempts\nto do, while at the same time ignoring the context of the broader\n\\emph{conceptual horizon} that surely incorporated an awareness of\nArchimedean and non-Archimedean issues stretching all the way back to\nEuclid.  \n\nWe will show that Schubring misinterprets both Leibniz and Felix Klein\non both the Archimedean property and infinitesimals, and ends up\nendorsing Moigno's flawed critique of infinitesimals; see\nSections~\\ref{s4} and \\ref{s5}.  Moreover, Schubring himself ignores\nthe contemporary historical \\emph{context} of Moigno's critique; see\nSection~\\ref{ban}.\n\n\n\\section{Axioms for Archimedean quantities}\n\\label{two}\n\nThe notion of infinitesimal is related to the axiom of Archimedes,\ni.e., Euclid's \\emph{Elements}, Definition V.4 (see\n\\cite[Section~II.3]{De15} for more details).  The theory of magnitudes\nas developed in Book V of the \\emph{Elements} can be formalized as an\nordered additive semigroup $M$ with a total order, characterized by\nthe five axioms given below.\n\n\\cite{Bec} and \\cite[pp.~101-122]{BM} provide detailed sources for\nthe axioms below in the primary source (Euclid).  See also\n\\cite[pp.~118-148]{Mue} which mostly follows Beckmann's development.\nAxiom E1 below interprets Euclid~V.4:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[E1] $(\\forall x, y\\in M)(\\exists n\\in {\\mathbb N})(nx > y)$,\n\\item[E2] $(\\forall x, y\\in M)(\\exists z\\in M)(x < y \\Rightarrow x + z=y)$,\n\\item[E3] $(\\forall x, y, z\\in M)(x < y \\Rightarrow x + z < y + z)$,\n\\item[E4] $(\\forall x\\in M)(\\forall n \\in {\\mathbb N})(\\exists y\\in M)(x =ny)$,\n\\item[E5] $(\\forall x, y, z\\in M)(\\exists v\\in M)(x : y :: z : v).$\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Schubring's pseudohistory}\n\nWe find multiple problems with Schubring's analysis of authors ranging\nfrom Proclus and Leibniz to Moigno and Klein.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we present several examples.\n\n\\subsection{Klein's horn-angles misunderstood by Schubring}\n\\label{s4}\n\nIt is well known that infinitesimals form a \\emph{proper} subset of a\nnon-Archimedean structure.  Now to formulate what it might mean for a\nstructure to be \\emph{NON-Archimedean}, one needs first to make up\none's mind as to what \\emph{Archimedean} itself might mean.\nSurprisingly, the book \\cite{Sc05} provides \\emph{no formulation\nwhatsoever} concerning the so-called Archimedean axiom\n\n\\footnote{On page 17, Schubring cites Proclus' correct reading of\nEuclid V.4, but as soon as Schubring attempts to paraphrase this in\nhis own terms, he immediately gets it wrong by describing\ninfinitesimals in terms of \\emph{incommensurability}.  The term\n\\emph{incommensurability} is used to describe phenomena related to\nirrationality, including both previous occurrences of the term in\n\\cite{Sc05} on pages 12 and 16.}\n\n(the term was introduced in \\cite{St83}).  More importantly,\nSchubring's remarks on Klein's horn-angles reveal a misconception on\nSchubring's part concerning non-Archimedean systems:\n\\begin{quote}\n[Felix] Klein has shown [sic] in detail that the hornlike angles form\na model of non-Archimedean quantities.  \\cite[p.~17]{Sc05}\n\\end{quote}\nBut is that really what Klein had shown?  In Klein's approach,\nhorn-angles form an ordered structure isomorphic to~${\\mathbb R}_+$ (when\nparametrized by the curvature), which can hardly be said to be\nnon-Archimedean.  Klein goes on to form a broader structure\nincorporating both horn-angles and rectilinear angles.  That structure\nis non-Archimedean (see Section~\\ref{two} for a discussion of the\nterm), and a horn-angle constitutes an infinitesimal within this\nstructure.  More precisely, a horn-angle is an infinitesimal\n\\emph{relative} to rectilinear angles.  Thus, it is incorrect to\nassert, as Schubring does, that ``hornlike angles form a model of\nnon-Archimedean quantities.''  Klein writes:\n\\begin{quote}\nThus multiplication of the angle of a tangent circle [i.e.,\nhorn-angle] by an integer [$n$] always yields another angle of a\ntangent circle, and every multiple $n$ is necessarily smaller, by our\ndefinition, than, say, the angle of a fixed intersecting line, however\nlarge we take~$n$. Thus the axiom of Archimedes is not satisfied; and\nthe angles of tangent circles must be looked upon, accordingly, as\nactually infinitely small \\emph{with respect to} the angle of an\nintersecting straight line.  \\cite[p.~205]{Kl25} (emphasis added)\n\\end{quote}\nThus, Klein's horn-angles are only infinitely small \\emph{with respect\nto} rectilinear angles.  Schubring's imperfect understanding of even\nthe basic issues involving infinitesimals leads to errors of judgment\non his part with regard to both Leibniz and Cauchy, as we show in\nSections~\\ref{s5} and~\\ref{43}.\n\n\n\\subsection\n{Leibniz's infinitesimals misinterpreted by Schubring}\n\\label{s5}\n\nA quotation from Leibniz on infinitesimals in \\cite{Sc05} is\naccompanied by the following claim:\n\\begin{quote}\n[Leibniz] declared two homogeneous quantities to be equal that\ndiffered only by a quantity that was arbitrarily smaller than a\n\\emph{finite quantity}.  \\cite[p.~169]{Sc05} (emphasis added)\n\\end{quote}\nSchubring takes two homogeneous quantities $x,y$ to be equal if their\ndifference $x-y$ is a quantity that is arbitrarily smaller than a\nfinite quantity, or in symbols\n", "index": 1, "text": "\n\\[\nx=y \\iff x-y< \\text{each finite quantity}.\n\\]\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"x=y\\iff x-y&lt;\\text{each finite quantity}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><mo>\u21d4</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mtext>each finite quantity</mtext></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
