(\\ref{eq:EKK}) \nand intermediate excitations up to $17~{\\hbar\\omega}$\nare included to guarantee convergence in the sum over intermediate\nstates.  Three-nucleon forces are included through the Fujita-Miyazawa\nterm with its strength given by a standard $\\pi$-$N$-$\\Delta$ coupling  \n\\cite{greenRepProgPhys}. \nThis term is in turn  transformed into a medium-dependent two-body\ninteraction, see  \nRefs.~\\cite{PhysRevLett.105.032501,Holt:2013jk,Holt:2014uc} for details. \n \nThe single-particle energies (SPEs) in the $sdpf$ space are input too.  \nPresent chiral interactions result in too large shell gaps for the single-particle energies. \nIn this work we employ $^{16}$O as the closed-shell core and fit the values of SPEs to selected \nobservables such as ground-state energies of $N<20$, $^{34}$Si 2$_1^+$ level, {\\it etc}.  \nThe energies of the 2p$_{1/2}$ and the 1f$_{5/2}$ orbits are constrained\nby the GXPF1 Hamiltonian of Ref.~\\cite{PhysRevC.65.061301}, due to lack of \nappropriate data.\n\nThese SPE values will be shown to produce \nreasonable results for single-particle levels for $^{40}$Ca.\nBecause of the $^{16}$O core, the SPEs are isospin invariant.\n\n\nIn this work we study Ne ($Z$=10), Mg ($Z$=12) and Si ($Z$=14) isotopes\nfor even $N$ from 10 to 40 with the full $sdpf$ shell.\n\n\n\n\nEigenvalues and eigenstates are obtained via standard Lanczos diagonalization method, \nlimiting ourselves up to 4 ${\\hbar\\omega}$\nexcitations from the $sd$-shell to the $pf$-shell. This reduces the dimension of\nthe matrices to diagonalize.\nIf the dimensionality exceeds $3\\times 10^{10}$,\nwe switch to a Monte Carlo Shell Model calculation \\cite{Otsuka:2001gx,Shimizu:2012dh}. This \n\nallows us to include much larger shell-model spaces.\n\nThe TBMEs vary gradually as a function of $A$ because ${\\hbar\\omega}$ changes.  \nAlthough they can be calculated for each nucleus explicitly,  \nwe introduce an overall scaling factor for the TBMEs as $(A/A_0)^{-0.2}$ with  \n$A_0=28$.  The value of the power is determined so that TBMEs calculated\nexplicitly for several nuclei can be best reproduced by this simple parametrization. \n\n\n\n{\\it Results and discussions.} --  Figure~\\ref{fig:GE} shows the ground-state energies of Ne, Mg and Si isotopes.\n\n\n\nSince we do not include the Coulomb force in the effective interaction,\nits contribution is subtracted from experimental data.\n\nThe results without 3NF are also plotted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:GE}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n \\includegraphics[width=8.5725cm,angle=0,clip]{fig1.eps}\n \\caption{(Color online)\n Ground-state energies of Ne, Mg and Si isotopes.

This is \nconsistent with earlier studies~\\cite{PhysRevLett.105.032501,Holt:2014uc}.\nWe point out that this repulsion becomes stronger as $Z$ increases,\nsuggesting that the present 3NF contribution is repulsive also in the proton-neutron \nchannel. \nFrom Fig.~\\ref{fig:GE}  we see that the drip lines for the three chains of isotopes are predicted at ${}^{{36}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Ne}}$, ${}^{{42}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Mg}}$\nand ${}^{{52}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$~\\cite{koura2005,Erler:2012cc}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n \\includegraphics[width=8.5725cm,angle=0,clip]{fig2.eps}\n \\caption{(Color online)\n (a) Excitation energies of first $2^{+}$\n  and $4^{+}$ states and (b) $\\mathrm{B(E2}: 0_1^{+}\\rightarrow 2_1^{+}$) values \n  of Ne, Mg and Si isotopes.\n Experimental data (symbols) ~\\cite{NationalNuclearDataCenter:2008tv,Takeuchi:2012ch} \n and present calculations (lines) are compared.}\n  \\label{fig:E2_BE2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:E2_BE2} (a) shows the $2^{+}$ and $4^{+}$ energy levels.\n\n\n\n\nThese excited states are well reproduced by the present calculation, including \nboth smooth and sudden changes as a function of $N$.\nThe 2$^+_1$ level drops down from $N=16$ to 20 with $\\Delta N=4$ for Ne isotopes, \nwhereas for the  Mg isotopes it remains rather constant up to $N=18$ and a similar \namount of the drop occurs in one step to $N=20$.  \nThe $4^{+}_1$ level varies differently as a function of $N$.\nFor instance, in Mg isotopes, it starts to come down from $N=16$ to $N=18$, implying that \nnot only the degree of deformation but also the shape is changing.\nOn the other hand, in Si isotopes, the 2$^+_1$ level jumps up at $N=20$.  \n\n\nAll these behaviors of excited levels are reproduced quantitatively \nby the present calculation.  \nThe low excitation energy of the $2^{+}_1$ levels in ${}^{{30}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Ne}}$ and \n${}^{{32}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Mg}}$ indicates that the $N=20$ shell gap is not dominant over $sd$-to-$pf$ excitations \nin these nuclei.  In contrast, the higher-lying $2^{+}_1$ level of ${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$\nsuggests that the gap restores its function.   \n\nWe point out here that the $2^{+}$ level comes down \nagain in Si isotopes with $N > 20$ as low as in Ne/Mg isotopes for $N > 20$.  \nIn fact, the $N = 20$ closure is broken again in these nuclei.\nThe probability of no $sd$-$pf$ excitations in the ground state is decreased \nbelow 30\\% in the present calculation for $N \\geq$18, 20 and 22 for Ne, Mg and Si isotopes, respectively.\nThus, the boundary of the island of inversion is not so simple. This may trigger further experimental studies. \n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:E2_BE2} (b) we show the \n$\\mathrm{B(E2}: 0_1^{+}\\rightarrow 2_1^{+}$) reduced transition probabilities. \nIn these calculations we fix effective charges to $(e_p,e_n)=(1.25, 0.25)e$. \n\n\nOur  $B(E2)$ values exhibit a good agreement with experiment. This agreement is however not as good as \nthat obtained for the energy levels.  This probably indicates the need to compute E2 operators using the same microscopic theory. \nThis will be presented elsewhere. \nNevertheless, we observe many interesting properties.\nWhile the $N=20$ shell closure in Si isotopes is evident, \n\n\n\nin Ne and Mg isotopes, the B(E2) values are larger at $N=20$ \nthan at $N=18$, a feature which is consistent with growing deformation.\nIn Si isotopes, large B(E2) values are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:E2_BE2} (b), \nin better agreement with recent unpublished data (not shown in the figure) ~\\cite{gade_priv}.\nFurther comparisons and insights will be of interest.\nNote that the B(E2) values become larger as $Z$ in Fig.~\\ref{fig:E2_BE2} (b), and \nthis is ascribed to larger charge for protons.\n\nWe discuss next the effective single particle energy (ESPE). The ESPE represents\nthe combined effect of the single-particle contribution from the inert core and monopole effects from other valence nucleons,\nproducing important effects on exotic nuclei \\cite{PhysRevLett.95.232502,Otsuka:2009qs,PhysRevLett.105.032501,nobel_otsuka}.   \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:ESPE} shows the ESPEs of the\n$N=20$ isotones, calculated in the filling scheme, with and without  3NF and tensor force components.\nHere the tensor force component is extracted from a spin-tensor decomposition\nof the $NN$ effective interaction generated by the EKK method \\cite{Tsunoda:2014hj}.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:ESPE} (a) shows that the effect of 3NF is primarily to raise all orbits by \nsimilar amounts \\cite{PhysRevLett.105.032501}.  \nWithout 3NF effect, the neutron orbits are bound too deeply, yielding excessive binding energies,  \nas seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:GE}.\nOn the other hand, \nFig.~\\ref{fig:ESPE} (b) demonstrates that the tensor-force effect can lower or raise the ESPEs, and thereby \nchange, rather rapidly, the spacing between orbits \\cite{PhysRevLett.95.232502}.   \nThe ESPEs obtained at $N=20$, including other $sdpf$ orbits, appear to be reasonable for $^{40}$Ca, \nsuggesting the validity of input SPEs being used. \n\n \n \\begin{figure*}[tbp]\n  \n \\includegraphics[width=17.1450cm,angle=0,clip]{fig3.eps}\n \n \n \n \n

the neutron $sd$-$pf$ gap grows \nrapidly as $Z$ increases\nfrom $Z=8$ to $Z=14$, and stays relatively constant after $Z=14$ up to $Z=20$ \nas being the $N=20$ magic gap.\nThis gap, however, disappears around $Z=8$, and the $N=16$ magic gap arises instead\n~\\cite{brownN16,ozawaPRL84,magic}.  \nThis is consistent with the trend shown by the simplified interaction, called VMU \\cite{Otsuka:2009qs}, \nwhere the central force gives a steady enlargement of the gap from $Z=8$ to $Z=20$, \nwhile the tensor force makes the change more rapid for $Z < 14$ but cancels the change for  \n$Z >14$.  \n\n\n\nWe demonstrate thus, for the first time, what type of shell evolution a chiral $NN$ interaction \nsuch as the ${\\chi\\mathrm{N}^3\\mathrm{LO} }$ interaction produces in medium-mass exotic nuclei.   \nIt is seen also that the lowering as a function of $Z$ is dampened  by three-nucleon forces.\nThe resulting trend is similar to that obtained  with the VMU interaction of Ref.~\\cite{Otsuka:2009qs} as well as\nother interactions fitted to experiment \n\\cite{PhysRevC.60.054315,Caurier:2013aoa,RevModPhys.77.427}.\n\n\n\nThe ground-state energy of Si  isotopes with $N > 20$ is lowered faster as a function of $N$ \nthan what can be expected from the ESPE in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ESPE}.\nThis seems to point to growing deformation in these isotopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:ESPE} (c,d), the proton shell evolution is shown as a function \nof $Z$.\nIn the case of ${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$, which is a doubly magic nucleus, \nthe proton gap between $d_{5/2}$ and $s_{1/2}$ \nplays also an important role in achieving $Z=14$ shell closure.\nWe note that 3NF enlarges this gap by $\\sim1.5$ MeV in this case.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tbp]\n \\includegraphics[width=8.5725cm,angle=0,clip]{fig4.eps}\n \\caption{(Color online) $2^{+}_1$ level of $N=20$ isotones.\n Solid line implies results of the full

\\label{fig:ant}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:ant} shows the $2^{+}$ level of the\n$N=20$ isotones ${}^{{30}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Ne}}$, ${}^{{32}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Mg}}$ and ${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$.\nThe solid line shows the results with the original full Hamiltonian.\nThe dashed (dot-dashed) line represents the calculation where \nthe tensor-force (3NF) is removed.\nIt is clear that both the tensor force and 3NF\ncontribute substantially to the excitation energy of\n${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$, while their absence does not change the $2^{+}$ level \nof ${}^{{30}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Ne}}$ and ${}^{{32}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Mg}}$.  \nIn fact, the tensor force (3NF)  changes the shell\nstructure so as to suppress the mixing across the $N=20$ ($Z=14$ sub-shell) gap and \nits effect is sizable for ${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$.\nLet us assume for simplicity that six protons fill the $d_{5/2}$ orbit in ${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$.\nThe tensor force between the proton $d_{5/2}$ and the neutron\n$f_{7/2}$ (or $p_{3/2}$) orbits is repulsive, whereas it is attractive \nbetween the proton $d_{5/2}$ and the neutron $d_{3/2}$ orbits.  \nThe tensor force thus enlarges the $N=20$ gap of\n${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$ with this assumed configuration.\n\n\nAs seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:ESPE} (c)\nthe proton gap between $d_{5/2}$ and $s_{1/2}$ is smaller\nwithout 3NF.\nThus, the proton sub-shell closure is weakened and\nprotons excited from the $d_{5/2}$ orbit to the $s_{1/2}$ orbit reduce the $N=20$ neutron gap.  \nAs a result, the $2^{+}$ energy of ${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$ is lowered if the tensor force or 3NF \nis switched off.\nIn ${}^{{30}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Ne}}$ and ${}^{{32}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Mg}}$, however, the $N=20$ gap is smaller, and proton \nconfigurations are more mixed due to stronger deformations.\nTherefore, in those states, configuration-dependent monopole effects cancel mutually, \nreducing the sensitivity of the $2^{+}$ excitation energy to nuclear forces.\n\n{\\it Summary.} --We have presented a unified description of neutron-rich nuclei around $N=20$ and\n$10\\leq Z \\leq 14$, as the first application of EKK method.  \nThe shell-model Hamiltonian \nis derived from the ${\\chi\\mathrm{N}^3\\mathrm{LO} }$ NN interaction. Three-nucleon forces are accounted for by the  Fujita-Miyazawa 3NF term.\n\nWe have succeeded in reproducing \nbinding energies, $2^{+}$ and $4^{+}$ excitation energies and B(E2) values of even-even\nnuclei, in good agreement with experiment.\nThus, the  nuclei in and around the ``island of inversion'' can be described without \nTBMEs fitted to experiment.\n\n\n\n\nThe present study confirms that chiral ${\\chi\\mathrm{N}^3\\mathrm{LO} }$ interactions with\nthree-nucleon forces lead to a comprehensive and precise description\nof nuclei in the region of the island of inversion, including the shell evolution.  \nBased on our findings and formalism, we foresee thus a wide variety of future\nperspectives, emergent phenomena and research directions for exotic\nnuclei.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nWe thank Dr. Y.~Utsuno for useful discussions.\nThe Lanczos shell-model calculation is performed with the code\n``KSHELL''~\\cite{Shimizu:1613378}.\nThis work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (23244049,15K05090). \nIt was supported in part by HPCI Strategic Program (hp140210,hp150224), in part by MEXT and JICFuS \nas a priority issue (Elucidation of the fundamental laws and evolution of the universe) \nto be tackled by using Post 'K' Computer, \nand also by CNS-RIKEN joint project for large-scale nuclear structure calculations.\n\\end{acknowledgments}\n\n\n\n\n\\bibliography{text}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 8280, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apsrev}\n\n\\title{Exotic neutron-rich medium-mass nuclei with realistic nuclear forces}\n\n\\author{Naofumi Tsunoda}\n\\affiliation{Center for Nuclear study, the University of Tokyo, 7-3-1\nHongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan}\n\\author{Takaharu Otsuka}\n\\affiliation{Center for Nuclear study, the University of Tokyo, 7-3-1\nHongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan}\n\\affiliation{Department of physics and Center for Nuclear Study,  \nthe University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan}\n\\affiliation{National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory,\nMichigan State University, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA}\n\\affiliation{Instituut voor Kern- en Stralingsfysica, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium}\n\\author{Noritaka Shimizu}\n\\affiliation{Center for Nuclear study, the University of Tokyo, 7-3-1\nHongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan}\n\n\\author{Morten Hjorth-Jensen}\n\\affiliation{National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and Department of Physics and Astronomy,\nMichigan State University, East Lansing, MI, 48824, USA}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics, University of Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway}\n\\author{Kazuo Takayanagi}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics, Sophia University, 7-1 Kioi-cho,\nChiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102, Japan}\n\\author{Toshio Suzuki}\n\\affiliation{Department of Physics, College of Humanities and Sciences,\nNihon University, Sakurajosui 3, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 156-8550, Japan}\n\n\\date{\\today}\n\n \\begin{abstract}\n  We present the first application of the newly developed theory of\n  effective nucleon-nucleon interactions to the structure of exotic nuclei. \n  This theory, a novel revision of many-body perturbation theory, \n  enables us to perform shell-model calculations with several major shells ({\\it e.g.} $sd$+$pf$). \n  Using the Entem-Machleidt QCD-based ${\\chi\\mathrm{N}^3\\mathrm{LO} }$ interaction and the Fujita-Miyazawa three-body force, \n  exotic neutron-rich Ne, Mg and Si isotopes are studied systematically, with a good description of \n  ground-state energies, 2$_1^+$ and 4$_1^+$ levels, and E2 transitions,\n  as the first shell-model calculation for the ``island of inversion'' \n  without two-body matrix elements fitted to experiment.    \n  The drip lines are predicted.\n  We show effective single-particle energies from this interaction, exhibiting the shell evolution\n  produced by the ${\\chi\\mathrm{N}^3\\mathrm{LO} }$ interaction + three-body force.   \n  The doubly-magic structure of ${}^{{34}}_{{}}\\mathrm{{Si}}$ is demonstrated.\n \\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{21.30.Fe, 21.60.Cs, 27.30.+t}\n\\keywords{Effective interaction, shell model, island of inversion, shell evolution, exotic nuclei}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\it Introduction.} -- The nuclear shell model \\cite{Mayer:1949,Jensen:1949} provides a\nunified and successful description of the structure of a large number\nof atomic nuclei. \n\n\n\n\nIt plays an\nimportant role in analyzing and predicting properties of both stable\nand exotic nuclei, as a many-body framework which can be related \ndirectly to nuclear forces.  Exotic nuclei are located far from   \n\nthe $\\beta$-stability line on the Segr\\`e chart, exhibiting very short life times, mainly due to an\nunbalanced ratio of proton ($Z$) and neutron ($N$) numbers.  Exotic\nnuclei differ remarkably in some other aspects from their stable\ncounterparts, \nproviding us with new insights in understanding atomic nuclei and nuclear forces \n\n~\\cite{Sorlin:2008er,Gade:2008we,nobel_otsuka}.  As experimental data\non exotic nuclei are, in general, less abundant compared to stable\nnuclei, theoretical calculations, interpretations and predictions play\nan ever increasing role.\n\nShell-model calculations handle the\nnuclear forces in terms of two-body matrix elements (TBME).  \nIn the early days, TBMEs were empirically\ndetermined in order to reproduce certain observables.  \nA well-known example is the effective interaction for\n$p$-shell nuclei by Cohen and Kurath~\\cite{Cohen:1965kz}.  A\nbreakthrough towards more microscopically derived TBMEs was\nachieved by Kuo and Brown for $sd$-shell nuclei~\\cite{KuoBrown}.\nAlthough basic features of the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) force for the shell-model calculation \nare included in these effective interactions, empirical adjustments and/or systematic fits of TBMEs\nwere needed in order to reproduce various observables \n\\cite{Brown1988191,RevModPhys.77.427,PhysRevC.65.061301}.\n\nThese effective interactions are all derived for a Hilbert\nspace represented by the degrees of freedom of one major (oscillator) \nshell. However, as we move towards exotic nuclei,\nmore complicated degrees of freedom start prevailing.   A\nnotable example is represented by the shell evolution due to\nnuclear forces between a proton and a neutron in different shells \n\\cite{PhysRevLett.95.232502,Otsuka:2009qs,nobel_otsuka}.\nThis leads to significant particle-hole excitations between two shells in for example  \nthe so-called $sd$-shell nuclei  \n\\cite{PhysRevLett.95.232502,Otsuka:2009qs,nobel_otsuka,Sorlin:2008er,Gade:2008we,Campi:1975un,Warburton:1990vw,Fukunishi:1992ic,PhysRevC.60.054315,Caurier:2013aoa,RevModPhys.77.427}. \nA microscopic understanding of many of these phenomena requires the degrees of\nfreedom of at least two major shells. For the description of the\nabovementioned $sd$-shell nuclei, this means that at least the degrees\nof freedom represented by the $sd$ and $pf$ shells need to be considered.\n\nTo derive effective Hamiltonians for shell model studies of exotic\nnuclei is a challenge to nuclear theory. Several attempts have\nbeen made recently in this direction\n\\cite{LisetskiyPhysRevC78,Bogner.PhysRevLett113,PhysRevLett.113.142502,Coraggio:2013dm,Coraggio:2014cf,Simonis2015,Jansen2015},\nwhile the issue of two major shells has been kept open. \n\nThe aim of this work is to present a systematic derivation of\nshell-model interactions for model spaces spanning more than\none major shell.  Based on the so-called Extended Kuo-Krenciglowa\n(EKK) method \\cite{Takayanagi201161,Takayanagi:2011dv,Tsunoda:2014hj}, \nwhich enables us to derive effective $NN$ interactions\nfor more than one major shell,  we\npresent in this Letter the first applications of this method  to the exotic\nneutron-rich isotopes Ne, Mg and Si. These are nuclei in and around\nthe so-called ``island of inversion'' \\cite{Warburton:1990vw}, \n\nwhere the degrees of freedom of at least\ntwo major shells are needed in order to obtain reliable descriptions of\ntheir low-energy properties.  We include also three-nucleon\nforces (3NF) since they have been shown to play an important role in\nreproducing basic features of nuclei  \n~\\cite{PhysRevLett.105.032501,Holt:2012gc,hagen2012a,hagen2012b,Ekstrom:2015gw}.\n\n{\\it Hamiltionan and model spaces.} -- \n\nThe many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) has been the\nstandard many-body method for deriving effective interactions, as discussed in\nRefs.~\\cite{Kuo:1971em,Krenciglowa1974171, Krenciglowa1977381,Kuo_springer,HjorthJensen1995125}.  \nThe conventional MBPTs, for instance, Kuo-Krenciglowa (KK) method \n~\\cite{Kuo:1971em,Krenciglowa1974171, Krenciglowa1977381}, are constructed \nfor degenerate single-particle states in the model space, of which one major shell is a typical case\n~\\cite{Kuo:1971em,Krenciglowa1974171, Krenciglowa1977381,Kuo_springer,HjorthJensen1995125}.   \nThe present model space, however, includes all single-particle states of the\n$sd$ and the $pf$ shells, labeled $sdpf$ hereafter.  \nThis leads to possible divergencies when\nconstructing an effective interaction with conventional MBPTs due to non-degeneracies of the \nsingle-particle states.\n\nA practical, but not satisfactory way to\ncircumvent such divergencies has been to enforce in an {\\em ad hoc} way degenerate\nsingle-particle energies for all involved single-particle\nstates spanning a model space, see for example\nRefs.~\\cite{Holt:2012gc,Holt:2013en,Holt:2014uc}.  \nEmploying the EKK method as done in this work, removes the\nabovementioned divergency problems and allows for a correct treatment of\nthe different single-particle energies \\cite{Tsunoda:2014hj}.\nStarting from a Hamiltonian which contains kinetic energy and a two-body $NN$ interaction and\nfollowing the formalism described in Ref.~\\cite{Tsunoda:2014hj}, we can define  an effective Hamiltonian through\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:EKK}\n{H_{\\mathrm{eff}}}={H_{\\mathrm{BH}}}(\\xi)+\n \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k!}\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}^k \\hat{Q}(\\xi)}{{\\mathrm{d}} \\xi^k}\\{{H_{\\mathrm{eff}}} -\\xi\\}^k, \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{H_{\\mathrm{eff}}}={H_{\\mathrm{BH}}}(\\xi)+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k!}\\frac%&#10;{{\\mathrm{d}}^{k}\\hat{Q}(\\xi)}{{\\mathrm{d}}\\xi^{k}}\\{{H_{\\mathrm{eff}}}-\\xi\\}^%&#10;{k},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>eff</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>BH</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03be</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></munderover><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo lspace=\"0pt\" rspace=\"3.5pt\">!</mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi><mi>k</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03be</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>\u03be</mi><mi>k</mi></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>eff</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03be</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><mi>k</mi></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
