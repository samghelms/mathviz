structures are often associated with\nrelativistic jets and the jet to counter-jet ratios are used to obtain\nquantitative estimates of relativistic beaming.\nHere, unfortunately a large fraction of sources are non-detected\n($\\sim$51\\% in FIRST and $\\sim$67\\% in NVSS survey images) and\na majority of the rest of the detected sources are unresolved\n(22 objects out of 30).\nThe FIRST survey images probes structures on scales smaller than\nthe NVSS survey images (see Section~\\ref{data}).\nTherefore, we assume any difference of\nthe emissions between NVSS and FIRST images\nas extended emission, which is not Doppler boosted;\nand instead, if beaming is present, the emission detected in FIRST image\nwould possibly be Doppler boosted \\citep{Laletal2011}.\nHence, the ratio of the possibly boosted and the extended radio flux densities,\nor the $R$-parameter\ncould be used here to investigate relativistic beaming. \nSince a majority of sources are not detected,\nwe focus only on the detected sources (see also Section~\\ref{det-rate}). \nThe ratio of flux density for these detected (20 of 61) sources in\nboth, FIRST and NVSS survey images is close to 1.0\nwith mean and median being $1.06\\pm0.04$ and 1.02, respectively.\nClearly, much higher resolution, scales of milli-arcsecond would be required to\naddress relativistic beaming.\nAdditionally, the use of $R$-parameter as measure of relativistic beaming\ncomes with a caveat.\n\\citet{Laletal2011} have shown that Seyfert galaxies show radio variability\nand the FIRST and the NVSS\ndata for the FHIL-emitting Seyfert sample are not simultaneous.\nTherefore, here we have made an assumption that\nthese sample objects do not show radio variability \\citep[see also][]{Mundeletal2009}.\n\nAdditionally, \\citet{FSP96} showed that Lorentz factors of $\\gamma$ = 2--4 in\nradio-quiet AGNs are sufficient to boost the radio emission\ninto the radio-intermediate regime or into the radio-loud regime.\nFive objects from FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample\nare of radio-intermediate kind:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[--] one (out of 11) NLS1,\n\\item[--] one (out of 14) Seyfert~1.0,\n\\item[--] one (out of two) Seyfert~1.9 and\n\\item[--] two (out of 18) Seyfert~2.0.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAlthough this is a small number statistics,\nmajority are non-type~1 Seyfert galaxies,\nand it is well known that Seyfert~2 galaxies being edge-on counterparts\nof beamed population, which are not expected to show relativistic beaming.\nTherefore, it is possible that FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample are\nradio-quiet and there is no evidence of relativistic beaming consistent\nwith the predictions of unified scheme hypothesis,\nwhich is further supported by other Seyfert galaxy samples \\citep{Laletal2011}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.5cm]{fig4a.ps} \\hspace{2mm}\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.5cm]{fig4b.ps}

of\n[Fe\\,X] (top-left panel),\n[Fe\\,XI] (top-right panel),\n[Fe\\,VII] (middle-left panel),\n[O\\,III] (middle-right panel),\n[O\\,I] (bottom-left panel), and\nH$_{\\alpha}$ (bottom-right panel.\n[O\\,III] and H$_{\\alpha}$ line luminosities\ncorrespond to combined core and wing components and combined narrow and\nbroad H$_{\\alpha}$ model components, respectively (GMW09).\nIn Section 2.1, we discussed inherent biases in the sample\nand hence possible difference between NLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies\nare seen in H$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] lines.\nBarring, correlation between radio power and\nH$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity, X-ray luminosity and ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] lines,\nwhich we discuss below (Section~\\ref{rad-halp}, \\ref{rad-xray},\n\\ref{rad-xray-rat}, respectively), none suggest that the distribution of\nNLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies are dissimilar.\nWe therefore find no observational evidence against the unified\nscheme hypothesis.  The K--S test gives a significance level of 0.031 or\nbetter that the Seyfert types, Seyfert~1 galaxies along with NLS1 galaxies\nand Seyfert~2 galaxies\nare drawn from the same parent population,\nand there is no significant differences between Seyfert~1 galaxies along with NLS1 galaxies\nand Seyfert~2 galaxies, based on the distributions of\n[Fe\\,X], [Fe\\,XI], [Fe\\,VII], [O\\,III], and [O\\,I],\n\nwhich was also independently concluded by GMW09.\n\nBelow we discuss those cases where we clearly see segregation between\nthe Seyfert types and their implications on the unified scheme\nhypothesis.\n\n\\subsubsection{Radio and H$_{\\alpha}$ Luminosities}\n\\label{rad-halp}\n\nThe radio luminosity versus H$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity correlation plot in\nFigure~\\ref{fe-o-h-corr} (bottom-right panel) show that, both types\nof Seyfert galaxies have similar radio powers, but Seyfert~2 galaxies have\nsystematically lower H$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity than Seyfert~1 galaxies along with NLS1\ngalaxies.\nthe latter is because the broad component of H$_{\\alpha}$\nin Seyfert~2 galaxies is obscured by the obscuring torus\nand is always not detected, which is more evident in Figure~A2b\n(from supplementary material) of GMW09.\nSince the sample is selected on FHIL emission,\nlines with ionization potential $\\gtrsim$100~eV (GMW09), their radio emission\nis expected to have similar distributions of radio powers\nwithin the framework of unified scheme hypothesis.\nThis is indeed the case, i.e., both types of Seyfert galaxies have similar radio powers,\nconsistent with the predictions of unified scheme.\n\n\\subsubsection{Radio and X-ray Luminosities}\n\\label{rad-xray}\n\nThere are only 32 sample sources with \\textit{ROSAT} detections,\nof which only three are Seyfert~2 galaxies,\n\nwhich on average have lower X-ray luminosities but their radio powers\nare similar to rest of the sample sources.\nIn Figure~\\ref{xray-corr}, we show the correlation\nbetween radio and soft X-ray luminosities fitted to Seyfert galaxy populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, \\textit{Chandra}/\\textit{XMM}-\\textit{Newton} data\ndo not exist for the sample.\nSeyfert~1 along with NLS1 galaxies and Seyfert~2 galaxies are known to\nhave, on average, steeper soft X-ray spectra and flatter hard X-ray spectra,\nrespectively\n\\citep{KCU1990,MasHessetal1994,Boller2000,Dadina2008}.\nHere, we used single uniform photon index,\n$\\Gamma$ = 1.5 as well as steeper photon index ($\\Gamma$ = 3.0)\ndata from GMW09 for Seyfert~1 along with NLS1 galaxies\nto convert \\textit{ROSAT} count rates to fluxes\n\\citep[GMW09;][]{Cappietal2006,Dadina2008}.\nWe find that the same correlation function applies between\nradio and soft X-ray luminosities for all types of Seyfert galaxies\nwith no systematic differences between them.\nWe therefore conclude that there is no difference between radio luminosities of\nNLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies, consistent with unified scheme.\n\n\\subsubsection{Radio Luminosity, and Ratio of\\[0pt] [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] Lines}\n\\label{rad-xray-rat}\n\nDifferences between the two types of Seyfert galaxies for\nthe ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] provide evidence that in Seyfert~2 galaxies\nthere exist partially obscured [Fe\\,X] emission and hence low ratio\nof these two lines (GMW09).\nThis is consistent within the stratified wind model framework discussed below\n(Section~\\ref{core-det}), that\nthe [Fe\\,X] is emitted on size scales that is comparable to the size of\nthe dusty molecular torus, and hence obscuration may be important.\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{flux-ratio-rad},\nNLS1 galaxies, Seyfert~1 galaxies and Seyfert~2 galaxies show\ndifference in the ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII]\nwhich are possibly because of (i) absorption of the [Fe\\,X]\nor (ii) different ionizing continuum (GMW09),\nwhere the latter is perhaps due to the bias in the sample.\nBriefly, in Seyfert~1 galaxies,\nthe line width of the [Fe\\,X] line profiles is broader, and\nthe ratios of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] tend to be higher,\nwhereas it is in opposite sense for the Seyfert~2 galaxies (GMW09).\nThese facts suggest that [Fe\\,X]-emitting clouds lie close to the radio\ncore and in certain lines of sights, some fraction of the [Fe\\,X] flux\n(i.e., the broad component) may be hidden by the obscuring torus (GMW09).\nHence, there is possibly an excess of ionizing photons from active nucleus and\nwe expect an over-production of [Fe\\,X] or the higher ratio of\n[Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] in the NLS1 galaxies and also in the Seyfert~1 galaxies,\nwhereas this would again be in opposite sense for Seyfert~2 galaxies\ndue to the obscured view of active nucleus by the obscuring torus.\nThese are in line with the expectations of the unified scheme hypothesis.\nHence, in Figure~\\ref{flux-ratio-rad},\nwe find all types of Seyfert galaxies to have similar radio powers,\nbut the Seyfert~2 galaxies on average have less [Fe\\,X] power per unit of\n[Fe\\,VII] power than the Seyfert~1 galaxies or NLS1 galaxies,\nwhich is again consistent with the predictions of unified scheme.\n\n\\subsection{Starburst vs. AGN Nature of FHIL-Emitting Seyfert Nuclei}\n\\label{core-det}\n\nWe first investigate if the radio emission from 8\\% radio-intermediate\nsources in the sample been enhanced due to intense star formation.\nQuantitatively, the mean radio power of radio-intermediate sources,\n$P^{\\rm tot}_{\\rm 1.4\\,GHz} \\simeq 8.5 \\times 10^{30}$\n{erg s$^{-1}$}\\ {Hz$^{-1}$}\\, implying a star formation rate (SFR)\nof $\\sim 220$ $M_{\\odot}\\, {\\rm yr^{-1}}$ for stars massive enough to form\nsupernovae, i.e., $M \\ge 5 M_{\\odot}$.\n\\citet{Mainierietal2005,Vignalietal.2009} and \\citet{Rosarioetal2012}\nshowed that such high rates of star formation are seen in high-$z$ AGNs,\nbut they are more than the SFR inferred for\n(i) typical nearby Seyfert galaxies \\citep{Alonso-Herrero}\nby an order of magnitude \\citep{Laletal2011},\nand also for (ii) the most luminous AGNs in the SDSS \\citep{Liuetal2009}.\nTherefore, it seems that the enhanced radio emission in radio-intermediate sources\nas compared to radio-quiet sources in the sample\nis unlikely to be due to intense star formation.\n\nSecondly,\nthe radio spectra of most Seyfert galaxies are known to be steep\npower laws near 1.4\\,GHz, $<\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 37837, "prevtext": "\n\\jkashead \n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nSpiral galaxies, having bright star-like nuclei covering a wide\nrange of ionization, are known as Seyfert galaxies.\nThey are generally classified into type~1 and type~2,\nwhich depends only on relative nuclear emission-line widths\n\\citep{KW74}.\nThe Seyfert~2 galaxies have relatively narrow permitted hydrogen lines and\nnarrow forbidden lines,\nwhereas Seyfert~1 galaxies have broad permitted hydrogen lines\nand narrow forbidden lines.\nThe widths of narrow lines and of broad lines in terms of full width\nat half maximum (FWHM) are ~$\\approx$~300--1,000~km~s$^{-1}$ and\n$\\ge$~1,000~km~s$^{-1}$ for type~2 and type~1, respectively.\nAn orientation based unified scheme\nis often used in explaining the\nclassification of a Seyfert galaxy, where\nthe Seyfert~2 represent edge-on source and\nthe Seyfert~1 galaxy is its pole-on equivalent\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{antonucci,Urry,Deoetal2007,Netzer2015}.\n\nObservational evidence for and against this unified scheme\nhypothesis exist on various scales and in all wavebands\n\\citep[see][for a brief summary]{Singhetal2013}.\nIn all these studies, sample selection is the key; for example,\nbiases against obscured sources, and biases towards dusty sources\nare suggested for the Optical-/UV-selected samples; whereas\nbiases towards sources with higher level of nuclear star formation are suggested\nfor the infrared-selected sources \\citep{Schmittetal2001,Masonetal2012}.\nSimilarly, optical-/UV-/X-ray selected flux limited samples, are all\nlikely to have intrinsically more luminous Seyfert~2 galaxies\nthan Seyfert~1 galaxies \\citep{Heckmanetal2005,WMW2009}.\nIn short, issues pertaining to sample selection are key\nand new efforts to test the unified scheme hypothesis with superior\nand well-chosen samples continue to be made\n\\citep[][and see also Section~\\ref{sample}]{Laletal2011,Urry}.\n\nThis paper tests the validity and limitations of the unified scheme\nhypothesis for Seyfert galaxies.\nHere, we present results for a Seyfert galaxy sample\ndefined by \\citet[][hereafter GMW09]{GMW2009},\nusing Very Large Array (VLA) survey images.\nThis large sample contains a diverse types of Seyfert galaxies.\nBelow, we first explain classifications of Seyfert galaxies\n(Section~\\ref{kinds}) and\ngive a brief description of the sample\n(Section~\\ref{sample}). We use the radio maps from\nFaint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty--Centimeters\n\\citep[FIRST;][]{becketetal} and\nNRAO VLA Sky Survey \\citep[NVSS;][]{Condonetal1998}\nfor the sample objects (Section~\\ref{data}), and interpret our\nresults (Section~\\ref{result}) and their\nimplications on the unified scheme hypothesis (Section~\\ref{discuss}).\nFinally, we summarize our conclusions in Section~\\ref{summary}.\n\nFollowing GMW09, we also adopt the same cosmological parameters\nfrom \\textit{Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe}.  Hence,\ndistance-dependent quantities are calculated assuming $H_0$ = 71\nkm~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ = 0.27, and $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ = 0.73\n\\citep{Spergeletal2003}.\nWhen archive radio data is available at other frequencies, we determine\nradio spectral index, $\\alpha$ which we define in the sense that\n$S_\\nu$ $\\propto$ $\\nu^\\alpha$, where $S_\\nu$ is the flux density\nand $\\nu$ is the frequency.\nAll coordinates mentioned below are for J2000 epoch.\n\n\\section{Background}\n\n\\subsection{Classifications of Seyfert Galaxies} \\label{kinds}\n\nIn addition to Seyfert galaxies of type~1 and type~2;\n\\citet{Osterbrock81} and \\citet{OP85}\nintroduced additional fractional classifications;\nthese appear to have a mix of properties from both types,\nas the broad component\nof H$\\beta$ becomes weaker as compared to the narrower component,\nthe Seyfert type changes from 1.2 $\\rightarrow$ 1.5 $\\rightarrow$ 1.8 $\\rightarrow$ 1.9.\nSeyfert~1.2 and 1.5 galaxies have composite spectra,\nwith both broad and narrow components easily recognizable\nand the former have broad component being stronger than narrow component,\nwhereas the latter have both components that are comparable.\nIn Seyfert~1.8 and 1.9 galaxies, in addition to the\nnarrow components, very weak but recognizable broad components of\nH$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$, or of H$\\alpha$ alone, respectively are present\n\\citep{Osterbrock81}.\nIn terms of the unified scheme hypothesis\nthese intermediate Seyfert types are thought to lie at a varying angles between\npole-on and edge-on views,\nwith Seyfert 1.2 galaxies being close to pole-on, whereas Seyfert 1.9 galaxies\nbeing close to edge-on.\n\\citet{OP85} proposed yet another type of Seyfert galaxies,\nthe narrow-line Seyfert~1 (NLS1) galaxies \\citep{Valencia2012}.\nThese objects have permitted line-widths much smaller than typical\nSeyfert~1 galaxies.  However, they differ from Seyfert~2 galaxies, in\nthe sense that optical spectra of NLS1 galaxies show several characteristics\nnormally associated with Seyfert~1 galaxies, such as [O\\,III]/H$\\beta$ ratios\nof less than 3, permitted lines are broader than forbidden lines,\nand blends of lines such as Fe\\,II or [Fe\\, VII] or [Fe\\,X].\nAgain, in the unified scheme frame-work,\nNLS1 galaxies could be sources with views very close to pole-on\n\\citep{Urry}.\n\n\\subsection{FHIL-Emitting Seyfert Galaxy Sample} \\label{sample}\n\nOur goal is to study the radio properties of Seyfert galaxies\nand their implications on the unified scheme hypothesis, and\nwe use Seyfert galaxies listed in GMW09, with strong forbidden high-ionization line\n(FHIL) emission.\nThis sample contains a diverse types of Seyfert galaxies,\nincluding NLS1 galaxies.\nIt has\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[--] 12 NLS1,\n\\item[--] 14 type~1.0,\n\\item[--] 16 type 1.5,\n\\item[--] 2 type 1.9, and\n\\item[--] 18 type~2.0 Seyfert galaxies. \n\\end{itemize}\nAlmost all known nearby, $z$ $\\lesssim$ 0.1 Seyfert galaxy samples, e.g.,\nthe bright Seyfert galaxies sample \\citep{giuricinetal},\nthe CfA Seyfert sample \\citep{HB92},\nthe 12~{$\\mu$}m Seyfert sample \\citep{RMS1993,HuntMalkan99},\nthe far-infrared selected Seyfert galaxy sample \\citep{royetal},\nthe matched Seyfert sample \\citep{Laletal2011}, etc.\nrarely have NLS1 galaxies in them and do not have appropriate proportion of Seyfert types\ndiscussed above.\nOther FHIL-emitting samples of Seyfert galaxies in the literature\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{DO1984,EAW97,MT1998,Veilleux1998,NTM2000}\nare all relatively small and heterogeneous.\nInstead, the GMW09 sample of Seyfert galaxies with strong FHILs is\none of the largest containing nearly equal proportion of diverse Seyfert types\nand hence, by far the most homogeneous to date.\nIn order to discuss differences between NLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies\nand its implications on the unified scheme hypothesis,\nwe henceforth address Seyfert~1.0 and 1.5, and Seyfert~1.9 and~2.0\nas Seyfert~1, and Seyfert~2 galaxies, respectively.\nNote that GMW09 found one galaxy with an unusual spectrum\nthat is not Seyfert-like (object 45, spectral type\n``gal'' in GMW09), which was neither included by GMW09\nnor it is included in the rest of this paper.\nWe also do not include radio galaxy 3C\\,234 (object 22, spectral\ntype ``Seyfert~1.9''), though it was included by GMW09,\nbecause it is a radio-loud active galactic nucleus \\citep[AGN;][]{LRL1983}.\nOne another source (object 53, spectral type ``NLS1\") is not covered by the FIRST survey\nand is not detected in NVSS image;\nthis too is excluded.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\\centering\n\\caption{Map parameters for the extended sources from the FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccclr}\n\\toprule\n{Object} & {Restoring}

magnitude\nlower than that of our X-band survey (Lal \\& Ho 2010).\nFurthermore, the sensitivity of NVSS survey images\nat 1.4 GHz with {45{$^{\\prime\\prime}$}}~resolution is $\\sim$0.45 mJy~beam$^{-1}$\n\\citep{Condonetal1998},\na factor of three lower than the FIRST survey images and\nsurprisingly the detection rate was again identical.\nSince, the sample of 61 Seyfert galaxies with FHIL-emitting features also come from\nSDSS, we believe that deeper new observations may not be necessary\nto understand basic radio properties.\nWe therefore use FIRST survey images (at 1.4\\,GHz, $\\sim$5$^{\\prime\\prime}$\nresolution) together with NVSS images (at 1.4\\,GHz, $\\sim$45$^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution),\nand archive VLA data, when available\nalong with published optical and X-ray (GMW09) data\nextensively to draw our conclusions.\n\n\\section{Results} \\label{result}\n\n\\subsection{Maps and Source

\\label{det-rate}\n\nOf the 61 FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxies in the sample, 30 (49\\%)\nhave been detected down to the FIRST survey {r.m.s.} sensitivity limit of\n0.15 mJy beam$^{-1}$ \\citep{becketetal}.\nThis detection rate further lowers, 34\\% (21/61)\nif we instead consider NVSS data.\nFurthermore, this detection rate is:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item{lower than the detection rate of type~2 SDSS quasars sample\n\\citep[][median redshift = 0.427]{LalHo2010},\n$\\sim$59\\% (35/59) and 63\\% (35/56)\nusing X-band images and using FIRST survey images, respectively;}\n\\item{lower than the detection rate of complete sample of local Seyfert galaxies\n\\citep[][median redshift = 0.003]{PanessaGiorletti2013}: 74\\% (17 of 23, milliarcsec-scale resolution)\nand 100\\% (23 of 23, VLA, arcsec-scale resolutions);}\n\\item{lower than the detection rate of matched sample of Seyfert galaxies\n\\citep[][median redshift = 0.019]{Laletal2011}: 100\\% (20 of 20; both, milliarcsec-scale and\narcsec-scale resolutions);}\n\\item{lower than the detection rate of extended 12~{$\\mu$}m Seyfert galaxy sample\n\\citep[][median redshift =

redshift = 0.0141]{HB92,Kukulaetal95}:\n81\\% (39 of 48; VLA $A$-array configuration, sub-arcsec-scale resolutions) and\n88\\% (42 of 48; VLA $C$-array configuration, arcsec-scale

far-infrared selected\nSeyfert galaxy sample: $\\sim$39\\% \\citep[][median redshift = 0.031]{royetal}.}\n\\end{enumerate}\nNote that barring type~2 SDSS quasar sample \\citep{LalHo2010},\nall other Seyfert galaxy samples are nearby (redshift $\\lesssim$ 0.03),\nand except\nradio observations of two Seyfert galaxy samples,\n\\citet{royetal} and \\citep{PanessaGiorletti2013}, which are\nat higher angular resolutions, the radio data of all other samples\nare at similar, arcsecond-scale resolutions.\nAmong these nearby Seyfert galaxy samples,\nthe detection rates of FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy and\nfar-infrared selected samples are similar.\nLooking more closely only at the detected sources,\nthe sample size of 21 objects; namely,\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[--] three (out of 11) NLS1,\n\\item[--] four (out of 14) Seyfert~1.0,\n\\item[--] four (out of 16) Seyfert~1.5,\n\\item[--] one (out of 2) Seyfert~1.9 and\n\\item[--] nine (out of 18) Seyfert~2.0.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThus, the detection rates of NLS1, Seyfert 1 and Seyfert~2\ngalaxies are $0.25\\pm0.16$, $0.27\\pm0.11$, and $0.50\\pm0.07$, respectively.\nAlternatively, the radio detection rate of compact radio structure\nfor NLS1, Seyfert 1 and Seyfert~2 is consistent with the unified scheme hypothesis.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.5cm]{fig2a.ps}\\hspace{3mm}\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.5cm]{fig2b.ps}\n\\caption{Histograms showing distributions of total detected radio\nluminosity (erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$) for the FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxies from\nSDSS at 1.4 GHz using VLA $B$-array \\citep[left panel, FIRST:][]{becketetal} and\nthe radio luminosity (erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$) at 1.4 GHz using VLA\n$D$-array \\citep[right panel, NVSS:][]{Condonetal1998}.\nThe undetected sources are not explicitly denoted,\nthey all lie at

Seyfert~1.9 = magenta, and Seyfert~2.0 = red.\nThe overlapping lines are marginally shifted with respect to\neach other for clarity.}\n\\label{first-nvss}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\citet{UWS81}, \\citet{Whittleetal86}, \\citet{Evansetal91} and \\citet{FWS98}\nnoted that compact radio emission is closely\nassociated with individual narrow-line region clouds,\nand \\citet[][and see also Norris {et~al.} 1992]{royetal} first invoked a model that\nfree--free absorption by these clouds may explain\nthe low detection rate in FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxies.\nIn particular, when observing Seyfert galaxies\nshowing very low radio emission from the nucleus,\neither (i) the narrow-line region or\n(ii) the individual narrow-line region clouds would absorb radio emission; i.e.,\nif the optical depths are above unity due to free--free absorption then\neither the narrow-line region or\nthe individual narrow-line clouds will block our view of the core and we would not\ndetect it in radio band.\nAlthough this model involve optical depth effects in the narrow-line region,\nits geometry and filling factor, it reconciles our low radio detection rate.\n\nFurthermore, in this model, the narrow-line region clouds\nwould become optically thin at higher frequencies and\noptically thick at further lower frequencies \\citep{Norrisetal1992}.\nSo new radio observations at a sufficiently high frequencies should find higher\ndetection rates and similarly, at sufficiently low frequencies should find\nlower detection rates, which is a possible test\nif free--free absorption by these clouds\nis indeed responsible for the low detection rate at 1.4\\,GHz for the FHIL-emitting\nSeyfert galaxies in the sample.\n\n\\subsubsection{Projected Linear Sizes}\n\nTwenty-two of 30 ($\\sim$73\\%) detected objects\nare classified as ``U'' or ``S'', unresolved or slightly resolved\nand the radio emission in these is largely from the central active nucleus.\nThis result shows that a significant fraction of Seyfert galaxies\ndo not have double/triple radio sources, instead they have unresolved\nstructures on a scale of several hundred parsecs to a few kiloparsecs.\nThe double radio sources that have been found in Seyfert galaxies generally\nhave angular separations smaller than the resolution of the present data\n\\citep{Kukulaetal95,Theanetal00,Laletal2004}.\nAlthough the exact number must await high-resolution radio maps\nof the complete FHIL-emitting Seyfert sample,\neight (out of detected 30 = 27\\%) sources (Figure~\\ref{rad-images}) have\nmarginally extended, about a few kiloparsec scale to a few tens of\nkiloparsec scale structures.\nThe largest projected linear sizes ({l.l.s.}),\ndetermined from largest-angular-sizes ({l.a.s.}) listed in Table~\\ref{map-param},\nfor eight extended sources shown in Figure~\\ref{rad-images}\ncorresponding to the 3$\\sigma$ contour level\nof the 1.4\\,GHz maps are listed in Table~\\ref{rad_sum}.\n\nClearly Seyfert~1 and NLS1 galaxies have larger range in projected linear\nsizes as compared to Seyfert~2 galaxies.\nUnfortunately with only eight sources, three Seyfert~1, three NLS1 and\ntwo Seyfert~2, this is small number statistics.\nThe statistical test\\footnote{Since, we are dealing with small number\nstatistics, we use instead Mann--Whitney U test, a non-parametric\nstatistical hypothesis test for small sample sizes \\citep{SiegelCastellan}.}\ngives a poor significance level\nof 0.25 that the distribution of projected linear sizes of\nNLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies are same.\nHigher-resolution observations are therefore needed to resolve the FIRST survey\nimages into structures with physical sizes less than a kiloparsec,\nas often seen in nearby Seyfert galaxies\n\\citep[{e.g.,}][]{Kukulaetal95,Theanetal00,Laletal2004}.\nThese resolved morphologies would provide improved statistics and\ntest the distribution of projected linear sizes at a higher significance level.\n\n\\subsubsection{Kiloparsec-Scale Radio Luminosities}\n\\label{kpc-rad-lum}\n\nFigure~\\ref{first-nvss} shows the distribution of the radio luminosity\ndetected on 5$^{\\prime\\prime}$-scales (FIRST images) and\n45$^{\\prime\\prime}$-scales (NVSS images) for all Seyfert sub-classes.\nRadio luminosities for our sample sources are $K$-corrected,\nrest-frame values determined\nfrom observed flux densities at 1.4\\,GHz and\ncorresponding luminosity distances \\citep{LalHo2010}.\nSince majority (22 of the 30 confirmed detections) of the sources are unresolved\nand correspond to core emission, we assume\na typical spectral index, $\\alpha$ = $+$0.5 from cores of Seyfert galaxies\n\\citep{KellermannOwen}.\nWe have also chosen the radio luminosity bin widths sufficiently larger than\nthe {r.m.s.} noise in the maps to account for\nupper limits for undetected sources, which are not explicitly denoted in\nFigure~\\ref{first-nvss}.\nAlthough non-detections lie in the luminosity-bins corresponding\nto the low end of radio powers in both panels,\nthe distribution of radio powers at 1.4 GHz is continuous,\nshowing no separation between the detected and the non-detected objects.\nFurthermore,\nchanging the radio luminosity bin size does not make the distribution\nbimodal (or multimodal).\nThis suggests that the detected and undetected sources from the\nFHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample irrespective of Seyfert class\ndenote a single population as a whole.\n\nIn addition, the radio power distributions are not significant different between\nNLS1 galaxies, Seyfert~1 galaxies and Seyfert~2 galaxies.\nThe K--S test gives a significance level\nof 0.026 or better that the distribution of Seyfert~1 along with NLS1 galaxies\nand Seyfert 2 galaxies are same for the FIRST and NVSS data.\nThus, we conclude that the radio power distributions\nof Seyfert galaxy types are similar\nand are consistent with the expectations of the unified scheme.\n\n\\subsubsection{Nature of Radio Emission}\n\n\\citet{baumheckman} and \\citet{RawlingsSaunders1991} showed that a\ncorrelation exists between the radio luminosity at 5\\,GHz\nand the [O\\,III]\\,$\\lambda$\\,5007\\,\\AA\\ narrow-line luminosity.\nFigure~\\ref{xu-gel-samp} illustrates the distribution of\nintegrated radio power (at 5 GHz) versus\n[O\\,III] luminosity for the large,\nheterogeneous sample of AGNs compiled by \\citet{XuLivioBaum1999},\nafter correcting for the cosmology.\nThe data for FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxies come from 1.4 GHz;\nand to be consistent with \\citet{XuLivioBaum1999},\nwe converted these measurements to 5~GHz assuming a flat spectrum\nspectral index of $\\alpha$ = 0 and determine the monochromatic power.\nThese monochromatic powers change at the most by a factor of 12\\%,\nif instead we assume a slightly inverted or steep spectra\n(see also Section~\\ref{kpc-rad-lum}) and\nit does not change our interpretations below.\nNote that we have computed [O\\,III] luminosities using\ncombined fluxes of [O\\,III] core and [O\\,III] wing components\n(supplementary material: Table~A4, Column~8; GMW09).\nIt is clear that AGNs separate\ninto the two families of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs with a\nsignificant gap between them; i.e., the\nradio luminosities are different by a factor of 10$^3$--10$^4$\nbetween the two groups at a given [O\\,III] luminosity.\nAll the objects in FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample are of radio-quiet nature,\nwith $\\sim$8\\% that lie in between the two families of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs,\nalso called radio-intermediate AGNs.\nIt is not surprising that all the non-detected sources are radio-quiet.\nLinear fits to the FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample excluding the\nradio-intermediate objects yield\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "$$\n\\log L_{\\rm 5~GHz} = (0.45\\pm0.11) \\log L_{\\rm

the presence of ionized gas\nthat could contribute significant thermal emission at frequencies\n$\\ge$1.4 GHz.\nIt is thus important to compare the expected thermal emission and the\ntotal radio flux densities observed from Seyfert galaxies in the sample.\nWe now test and demonstrate that both, radio-quiet\nand radio-intermediate Seyfert galaxies in the sample have low-levels of\nexpected star formation rates, lower than\nthe limits that is needed to account for the observed radio emission.\nFollowing \\citet{Ho2005,Ho2008} and also \\citet{LalHo2010},\nthe [O\\,II]-derived SFRs are estimated to be\n$\\sim$0.2--10~M$_{\\odot}\\, {\\rm yr^{-1}}$,\nwith a mean ($\\approx$ median) value of $\\sim$0.6~M$_{\\odot}\\, {\\rm yr^{-1}}$\nfor the Seyfert galaxies in the sample;\nwe use the ratios of ionisation potentials between [O\\,I], [O\\,II] and [O\\,III] emission lines\nand [O\\,I] and [O\\,III] fluxes,\nand thereby determine [O\\,II] fluxes.\nUsing Equation 6 of \\citet{Bell2003},\nthe predicted radio emission from SFR is\n$\\sim1.1\\times 10^{28}$ {erg s$^{-1}$}\\ {Hz$^{-1}$}\\ at 1.4 GHz,\nwhich is at least an order of magnitude less than the mean radio luminosity\nof the sample sources (Figure~\\ref{xu-gel-samp} and \\ref{fe-o-h-corr}).\nAlternatively, assuming all lines of sight through the broad line region\nare optically thick in the radio, an upper limit to the thermal\nemission at the mean distance of $\\sim$400~Mpc for objects in the sample\ngives a flux density of $\\lesssim$ 0.004 mJy, quite undetectable for\ntypical values of densities of protons and electrons,\n$n_{\\rm p} = n_{\\rm e} \\simeq 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ in broad line clouds,\nof size $\\simeq$ 0.1~pc having a temperature $\\simeq$ 1.5 $\\times 10^4$

erg~s$^{-1}$\n\\citep{UWS81}.\nOn similar lines we calculate radio power $\\lesssim 10^{27}$ erg~s$^{-1}$~Hz$^{-1}$,\nusing canonical $n_{\\rm e} \\simeq$ 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$,\ntemperature $\\simeq$ 1.5 $\\times 10^4$ K, filling factor $\\simeq$ a few times\n10$^{-2}$ for narrow line clouds of size $\\simeq$ 0.1--1.0~kpc\nat mean distance for objects in the sample.\nClearly, it is the narrow line region that has relatively larger\nthermal emission contribution\nto the observed radio emission as compared to the broad line region.\nBut the derived thermal contributions at 1.4\\,GHz are small,\nat a level of 10\\% or less of the observed flux density for objects\nin the FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample.\nAlso, \\citet{Guetal2006}\nused the observed emission-line ratios along with population synthesis models\nand concluded that although there is a contribution of starbursts to the\nnuclear emission in a radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies,\nthe contribution of the hidden active nucleus always dominates.\nTheir conclusion compares well for the FHIL-emitting sources studied here.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.35cm]{fig6.ps}\n\\caption{Radio power at 1.4~GHz from VLA~$B$-array configuration\nversus [Fe\\,X]/[Fe\\,VII] flux

the light of a stratified wind model,\nfirst proposed by \\citet{Osterbrock1991},\noutflowing photoionized clouds produce [Fe\\,XI], [Fe\\,X],\n[Fe\\,VII] and possibly [O\\,III] (GMW09),\nwith high-ionization lines are produced preferentially\nat small distances from the core,\nwhile low-ionization lines are preferentially produced at larger radii.\nMore specifically\n[Fe\\,XI]- and [Fe\\,X]-emitting clouds lie closest to the radio core and\nare on the scale of broad-line region or of obscuring torus,\n[Fe\\,VII]-emitting clouds are more extended and may approach\nthe scale of narrow-line region, and\nfinally [O\\,III]- and [O\\,II]-emitting clouds,\nwhich do not show a velocity shift with respect to [S\\,II] (GMW09),\nlie farthest from the radio core and more likely are the decelerated part\nof the stratified wind outflow model \\citep{Colbertetal1996a,Colbertetal1996b}.\nIf this model is correct, we expect to find a strong correlation between\nemission-line shifts and ionization potential of the line-emitting species;\nimplying density and ionization stratification \\citep{Komossaetal2008}.\nSuch correlations were indeed reported by GMW09\nfor some of the ion species.\nThus, there is a ionization stratification associated with clouds,\nand possibly clouds on scales of narrow-line region, which\nhave relatively the least amount of ionization stratification,\nhave large optical depths at 1.4\\,GHz.\nThese clouds are responsible for free--free absorption of radio emission\nfrom the core, leading to inferred low radio detection rate irrespective of\nSeyfert types, which is consistent with orientation based unified scheme hypothesis.\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Future Directions} \\label{summary}\n\nThis paper presents radio properties of a sample of\n61 sources containing a diverse range of Seyfert galaxies.  This is\none of the largest, homogeneous samples of Seyfert galaxies with strong FHIL\nemission selected from the SDSS to date (GMW09).  Here we used high-resolution FIRST data\n\\citep[5{{$^{\\prime\\prime}$}} resolution images,][]{becketetal}\nalong with low-resolution NVSS radio data\n\\citep[45{{$^{\\prime\\prime}$}} resolution images,][]{Condonetal1998}, both at 1.4 GHz.\nOur main results are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item{Our detection rate of 49\\% at 1.4 GHz is lower than many other\nSeyfert galaxy samples, except far-infrared selected sample compiled by \\citet{royetal}.}\n\n\\item{A high fraction (76\\%) of compact cores are seen within confirmed\ndetected sources.  The radio emission within these compact cores is confined\nto physical sizes $\\lesssim$8~kpc.\nThe remaining 24\\% objects contain extended, core-jet structures,\ntypical of nearby Seyfert galaxies.}\n\n\\item{The detection rate of compact radio structure in NLS1, Seyfert 1\nand Seyfert~2 galaxies is consistent with the unified scheme hypothesis.}\n\n\n\n\\item{The distributions of radio power for Seyfert~1 along with NLS1 galaxies and\nSeyfert~2 galaxies for the sample are not significantly different.\nThis is possibly consistent with the unified scheme hypothesis.\nHowever, given the size of the sample with several upper limits,\nit is difficult to uncover any subtle differences that might exist between\nthe types of Seyfert galaxies.}\n\n\\item{There is possibly no evidence of relativistic beaming in nuclei for objects\nin our sample.}\n\n\\item{Approximately 8\\% of the sample sources have ratio of radio luminosity\nand [O\\,III]\\,$\\lambda$\\,5007\\,\\AA\\ luminosity such\nthat they qualify as radio-intermediate sources and the remaining are\nradio-quiet.}\n\n\\item{The distributions of line luminosities and\nthe X-ray luminosities for the two Seyfert types are also consistent with\nthe unified scheme hypothesis.}\n\n\\item{These sample objects clearly show AGN activities with $\\le$10\\% contribution\nfrom thermal emission, and they show poor \\mbox{($\\sim0.6$ {$M_\\odot$}\\ {yr$^{-1}$})} SFRs,\ntypical of Seyfert galaxies.}\n\n\\item{It seems that there is ionization stratification associated with clouds,\nand possibly clouds on scales of 0.1--1.0~kpc have large optical depths at 1.4\\,GHz,\nwhich are responsible for free--free absorption of radio emission from the core,\npossibly, leading to low radio detection rate for these objects.}\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nHowever, a weakness remains with the data; these survey images are\nsensitive to extended emission from starburst activity around the nucleus\nin addition to the compact emission with the Seyfert core.\nFuture deeper, high-resolution and high-sensitivity radio observations at both,\nhigh and low radio frequencies are needed to\n(i) test and understand the low detection rate,\n(ii) resolve the FIRST survey images into structures of sizes less than a kiloparsec,\n(iii) test the predictions of free--free absorption of radio core emission\nby the narrow-line region clouds, and\n(iv) understand if these objects have AGN-like, high-brightness\ntemperature flat-spectrum cores,\nor these have steep-spectrum diffuse emission.\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nThe author thanks the anonymous referee for suggestions and criticisms which improved\nthe paper.\nHe also thanks Prof. M.

10$^8$~K for our sample objects, which is\nagain typical of Seyfert galaxies \\citep{BF2011}.\n\n\\subsubsection{Relativistic Beaming} \\label{beaming}\n\nIn radio galaxies, one-sided structures are often associated with\nrelativistic jets and the jet to counter-jet ratios are used to obtain\nquantitative estimates of relativistic beaming.\nHere, unfortunately a large fraction of sources are non-detected\n($\\sim$51\\% in FIRST and $\\sim$67\\% in NVSS survey images) and\na majority of the rest of the detected sources are unresolved\n(22 objects out of 30).\nThe FIRST survey images probes structures on scales smaller than\nthe NVSS survey images (see Section~\\ref{data}).\nTherefore, we assume any difference of\nthe emissions between NVSS and FIRST images\nas extended emission, which is not Doppler boosted;\nand instead, if beaming is present, the emission detected in FIRST image\nwould possibly be Doppler boosted \\citep{Laletal2011}.\nHence, the ratio of the possibly boosted and the extended radio flux densities,\nor the $R$-parameter\ncould be used here to investigate relativistic beaming. \nSince a majority of sources are not detected,\nwe focus only on the detected sources (see also Section~\\ref{det-rate}). \nThe ratio of flux density for these detected (20 of 61) sources in\nboth, FIRST and NVSS survey images is close to 1.0\nwith mean and median being $1.06\\pm0.04$ and 1.02, respectively.\nClearly, much higher resolution, scales of milli-arcsecond would be required to\naddress relativistic beaming.\nAdditionally, the use of $R$-parameter as measure of relativistic beaming\ncomes with a caveat.\n\\citet{Laletal2011} have shown that Seyfert galaxies show radio variability\nand the FIRST and the NVSS\ndata for the FHIL-emitting Seyfert sample are not simultaneous.\nTherefore, here we have made an assumption that\nthese sample objects do not show radio variability \\citep[see also][]{Mundeletal2009}.\n\nAdditionally, \\citet{FSP96} showed that Lorentz factors of $\\gamma$ = 2--4 in\nradio-quiet AGNs are sufficient to boost the radio emission\ninto the radio-intermediate regime or into the radio-loud regime.\nFive objects from FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample\nare of radio-intermediate kind:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[--] one (out of 11) NLS1,\n\\item[--] one (out of 14) Seyfert~1.0,\n\\item[--] one (out of two) Seyfert~1.9 and\n\\item[--] two (out of 18) Seyfert~2.0.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAlthough this is a small number statistics,\nmajority are non-type~1 Seyfert galaxies,\nand it is well known that Seyfert~2 galaxies being edge-on counterparts\nof beamed population, which are not expected to show relativistic beaming.\nTherefore, it is possible that FHIL-emitting Seyfert galaxy sample are\nradio-quiet and there is no evidence of relativistic beaming consistent\nwith the predictions of unified scheme hypothesis,\nwhich is further supported by other Seyfert galaxy samples \\citep{Laletal2011}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.5cm]{fig4a.ps} \\hspace{2mm}\n\\includegraphics[angle=270,width=8.5cm]{fig4b.ps}

of\n[Fe\\,X] (top-left panel),\n[Fe\\,XI] (top-right panel),\n[Fe\\,VII] (middle-left panel),\n[O\\,III] (middle-right panel),\n[O\\,I] (bottom-left panel), and\nH$_{\\alpha}$ (bottom-right panel.\n[O\\,III] and H$_{\\alpha}$ line luminosities\ncorrespond to combined core and wing components and combined narrow and\nbroad H$_{\\alpha}$ model components, respectively (GMW09).\nIn Section 2.1, we discussed inherent biases in the sample\nand hence possible difference between NLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies\nare seen in H$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity, X-ray luminosity, and ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] lines.\nBarring, correlation between radio power and\nH$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity, X-ray luminosity and ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] lines,\nwhich we discuss below (Section~\\ref{rad-halp}, \\ref{rad-xray},\n\\ref{rad-xray-rat}, respectively), none suggest that the distribution of\nNLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies are dissimilar.\nWe therefore find no observational evidence against the unified\nscheme hypothesis.  The K--S test gives a significance level of 0.031 or\nbetter that the Seyfert types, Seyfert~1 galaxies along with NLS1 galaxies\nand Seyfert~2 galaxies\nare drawn from the same parent population,\nand there is no significant differences between Seyfert~1 galaxies along with NLS1 galaxies\nand Seyfert~2 galaxies, based on the distributions of\n[Fe\\,X], [Fe\\,XI], [Fe\\,VII], [O\\,III], and [O\\,I],\n\nwhich was also independently concluded by GMW09.\n\nBelow we discuss those cases where we clearly see segregation between\nthe Seyfert types and their implications on the unified scheme\nhypothesis.\n\n\\subsubsection{Radio and H$_{\\alpha}$ Luminosities}\n\\label{rad-halp}\n\nThe radio luminosity versus H$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity correlation plot in\nFigure~\\ref{fe-o-h-corr} (bottom-right panel) show that, both types\nof Seyfert galaxies have similar radio powers, but Seyfert~2 galaxies have\nsystematically lower H$_{\\alpha}$ luminosity than Seyfert~1 galaxies along with NLS1\ngalaxies.\nthe latter is because the broad component of H$_{\\alpha}$\nin Seyfert~2 galaxies is obscured by the obscuring torus\nand is always not detected, which is more evident in Figure~A2b\n(from supplementary material) of GMW09.\nSince the sample is selected on FHIL emission,\nlines with ionization potential $\\gtrsim$100~eV (GMW09), their radio emission\nis expected to have similar distributions of radio powers\nwithin the framework of unified scheme hypothesis.\nThis is indeed the case, i.e., both types of Seyfert galaxies have similar radio powers,\nconsistent with the predictions of unified scheme.\n\n\\subsubsection{Radio and X-ray Luminosities}\n\\label{rad-xray}\n\nThere are only 32 sample sources with \\textit{ROSAT} detections,\nof which only three are Seyfert~2 galaxies,\n\nwhich on average have lower X-ray luminosities but their radio powers\nare similar to rest of the sample sources.\nIn Figure~\\ref{xray-corr}, we show the correlation\nbetween radio and soft X-ray luminosities fitted to Seyfert galaxy populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, \\textit{Chandra}/\\textit{XMM}-\\textit{Newton} data\ndo not exist for the sample.\nSeyfert~1 along with NLS1 galaxies and Seyfert~2 galaxies are known to\nhave, on average, steeper soft X-ray spectra and flatter hard X-ray spectra,\nrespectively\n\\citep{KCU1990,MasHessetal1994,Boller2000,Dadina2008}.\nHere, we used single uniform photon index,\n$\\Gamma$ = 1.5 as well as steeper photon index ($\\Gamma$ = 3.0)\ndata from GMW09 for Seyfert~1 along with NLS1 galaxies\nto convert \\textit{ROSAT} count rates to fluxes\n\\citep[GMW09;][]{Cappietal2006,Dadina2008}.\nWe find that the same correlation function applies between\nradio and soft X-ray luminosities for all types of Seyfert galaxies\nwith no systematic differences between them.\nWe therefore conclude that there is no difference between radio luminosities of\nNLS1, Seyfert~1 and Seyfert~2 galaxies, consistent with unified scheme.\n\n\\subsubsection{Radio Luminosity, and Ratio of\\[0pt] [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] Lines}\n\\label{rad-xray-rat}\n\nDifferences between the two types of Seyfert galaxies for\nthe ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] provide evidence that in Seyfert~2 galaxies\nthere exist partially obscured [Fe\\,X] emission and hence low ratio\nof these two lines (GMW09).\nThis is consistent within the stratified wind model framework discussed below\n(Section~\\ref{core-det}), that\nthe [Fe\\,X] is emitted on size scales that is comparable to the size of\nthe dusty molecular torus, and hence obscuration may be important.\nAs shown in Figure~\\ref{flux-ratio-rad},\nNLS1 galaxies, Seyfert~1 galaxies and Seyfert~2 galaxies show\ndifference in the ratio of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII]\nwhich are possibly because of (i) absorption of the [Fe\\,X]\nor (ii) different ionizing continuum (GMW09),\nwhere the latter is perhaps due to the bias in the sample.\nBriefly, in Seyfert~1 galaxies,\nthe line width of the [Fe\\,X] line profiles is broader, and\nthe ratios of [Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] tend to be higher,\nwhereas it is in opposite sense for the Seyfert~2 galaxies (GMW09).\nThese facts suggest that [Fe\\,X]-emitting clouds lie close to the radio\ncore and in certain lines of sights, some fraction of the [Fe\\,X] flux\n(i.e., the broad component) may be hidden by the obscuring torus (GMW09).\nHence, there is possibly an excess of ionizing photons from active nucleus and\nwe expect an over-production of [Fe\\,X] or the higher ratio of\n[Fe\\,X] and [Fe\\,VII] in the NLS1 galaxies and also in the Seyfert~1 galaxies,\nwhereas this would again be in opposite sense for Seyfert~2 galaxies\ndue to the obscured view of active nucleus by the obscuring torus.\nThese are in line with the expectations of the unified scheme hypothesis.\nHence, in Figure~\\ref{flux-ratio-rad},\nwe find all types of Seyfert galaxies to have similar radio powers,\nbut the Seyfert~2 galaxies on average have less [Fe\\,X] power per unit of\n[Fe\\,VII] power than the Seyfert~1 galaxies or NLS1 galaxies,\nwhich is again consistent with the predictions of unified scheme.\n\n\\subsection{Starburst vs. AGN Nature of FHIL-Emitting Seyfert Nuclei}\n\\label{core-det}\n\nWe first investigate if the radio emission from 8\\% radio-intermediate\nsources in the sample been enhanced due to intense star formation.\nQuantitatively, the mean radio power of radio-intermediate sources,\n$P^{\\rm tot}_{\\rm 1.4\\,GHz} \\simeq 8.5 \\times 10^{30}$\n{erg s$^{-1}$}\\ {Hz$^{-1}$}\\, implying a star formation rate (SFR)\nof $\\sim 220$ $M_{\\odot}\\, {\\rm yr^{-1}}$ for stars massive enough to form\nsupernovae, i.e., $M \\ge 5 M_{\\odot}$.\n\\citet{Mainierietal2005,Vignalietal.2009} and \\citet{Rosarioetal2012}\nshowed that such high rates of star formation are seen in high-$z$ AGNs,\nbut they are more than the SFR inferred for\n(i) typical nearby Seyfert galaxies \\citep{Alonso-Herrero}\nby an order of magnitude \\citep{Laletal2011},\nand also for (ii) the most luminous AGNs in the SDSS \\citep{Liuetal2009}.\nTherefore, it seems that the enhanced radio emission in radio-intermediate sources\nas compared to radio-quiet sources in the sample\nis unlikely to be due to intense star formation.\n\nSecondly,\nthe radio spectra of most Seyfert galaxies are known to be steep\npower laws near 1.4\\,GHz, $<\n",
