Only eight viable models survive out of an initial set of\n32 local minima in the parameter space. These models clearly indicate\nthat the lens is a stellar binary system possibly located within the\nbulge of our Galaxy, ruling out the planetary alternative. We argue\nthat several types of discrete degeneracies can be broken via such\nspace-based parallax observations.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{gravitational lensing: micro, planets and satellites: detection, binaries: general, galaxy: bulge, space vehicles}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}}\n\nStrong discrete degeneracies appear generically in the solutions\nto microlensing light curves.  Very often these have little practical\nimportance, either because they are adequately broken by high quality\ndata or they prove to have very similar scientific implications.\nNevertheless, there are many cases for which an unbroken degeneracy\nhas serious consequences and thus is quite frustrating, and some\ncases (including the one reported here) where it has major\nimplications for the event in question.  Therefore, any new methods\nfor breaking these degeneracies deserve the greatest consideration.\n\nTo be clear, by ``strong'' degeneracies, we mean those that lead\nto very similar light curves over the whole event (or the great\nmajority of the event).  There is another class of ``accidental''\ndegeneracies in which the two solutions have very different features\nduring gaps in the data.  The obvious remedy for the latter is to ensure a full coverage of the microlensing event even in the wings, something that with the advent of new, near-continuous surveys (or combinations of surveys) will become a standard for the great majority of the events. We will therefore concentrate on strong degeneracies, which produce light curves that are indistinguishable from ground-based observatories and thus cannot be solved just by increasing the sampling rate or the coverage.\n\nFrom theoretical considerations, there is good reason to expect that\nobservations from a ``microlens parallax satellite'' in solar orbit\nmight play a powerful role in breaking such degeneracies.  We\nillustrate this expectation by considering the most deeply understood\ndegeneracy: the so-called ``wide/close'' binary degeneracy.  This is\na degeneracy between binary solutions for which the companion lies\noutside the Einstein ring ($s>1$, where $s$ is the projected\nseparation normalized to the angular Einstein radius $\\theta_{\\rm E}$) and\nsolutions for which the companion is inside the ring $(s<1)$.  This\n$(s\\leftrightarrow s^{-1})$ degeneracy was discovered empirically in\ndata for MACHO-98-SMC-1\n(Figure~8 from \\citealt{ms9801}) at roughly the same time that\n\\citet{griest98} and \\citet{dominik99} derived its fundamental cause:\na deep symmetry between a tidal expansion of the lens equation in the\nlimit $s\\gg 1$ and a quadrupole expansion in the limit $s\\ll 1$.\nNevertheless, even though this symmetry is exact in these limits, in\nthe practical example of MACHO-98-SMC-1 it was already clear that the\nfull two dimensional (2-D) caustic structure differed significantly\nfor the two cases. That is, even though the 2-D caustic structures\nlooked manifestly different, the light curves generated by 1-D tracks\nthrough this structure were virtually identical.  After this same\nbehavior was noticed for MACHO-99-BLG-47 \\citep{mb9947} (see\nespecially their Figure~4), \\citet{an05} was able to explain the\napparent relative ``rotation'' of the two caustics by pursuing the\nexpansion of the lens equation in each limit to second order (see\nalso \\citealt{Boz00}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe potential for a parallax satellite to break such degeneracies\n{bf can be} recognized by considering Figure~8 of \\citet{ms9801} or\nFigure~4 of \\citet{mb9947}.  This degeneracy arises because the\nmagnification patterns of the two solutions differ only by an overall\nscale factor along the source trajectory, but deviate considerably from\nthis single scale factor away from this trajectory.  Observing the\nevent from a satellite introduces a second source trajectory that\nprobes a different part of the magnification pattern.\nFor simplicity, consider first that the satellite is not moving with\nrespect to Earth.  Then the apparent source trajectory through the\ncaustic structure as seen from the satellite is perfectly parallel to\nthat seen from Earth but is offset by a 2-D vector that (together\nwith the known Earth-satellite separation) essentially determines the\nparallax vector ${{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\pi$}}}_{\\rm E}$. Then any physical offset between observatories\nwill produce caustic crossings in the second trajectory\nat distinctly different times for each caustic, exactly because they\nare rotated, thereby distinguishing between the solutions. The only\nexception would be if the offset were exactly along the trajectory (i.e.,\nthe source motion is along the Earth-satellite axis), so that there\nwould be identical lightcurves, just displaced in time.  The same\nargument\napplies even though the Earth-satellite projected separation changes\nwith time.  In this more general case, the trajectories are not\nperfectly parallel, but they are still rigidly determined (and\nseparated) for\nany fixed choice of ${{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\pi$}}}_{\\rm E}$.\n\nWhen the source does not experience caustic crossings, the effect of\nthe binary (or planetary) nature of the lens on the lightcurve is\nprimarily via cusp approaches.  These can create dramatic bumps\nif the source passes close to one or several cusps, but can also\ngenerate weak, longterm distortions for distant passages.\nFor roughly equal mass binaries, these caustics are\nroughly symmetric (concave) quadrilaterals, so that a source can\npass at most two cusps (see Fig. \\ref{fig:caust}).  For planets\n(with mass ratios $q\\ll 1$),\nthe caustics assume a kite-like form, with three cusps at one end and\none at the other (Fig. \\ref{fig:caust}).  On the three-cusp side,\nthe two outer cusps protrude much further than the central cusp\n(which is close to the host).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{Figcaust.eps}\n\\caption{Caustics of the best binary model (in black) and the best planetary model (in blue). Also displayed are the source trajectories for the two models: in solid style for the binary and dashed for the planetary; grey for the source as seen from ground observatories, red as seen from Spitzer. In order to compare the two models, the planetary one has been rotated and re-scaled so as to make the source trajectories match as seen from ground  (in practice, they are on top of each other). The corresponding light curves are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:lc} and \\ref{fig:compare}. This figure also illustrates the degeneracy discussed by \\citet{han08}.}\n\\label{fig:caust}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIf, for example, the lightcurve experiences two bumps near its\noverall peak, these could in principle be due either to the source\npassing two neighboring cusps from a binary caustic or the two outer\ncusps from a planetary caustic \\citep{han08,choi12,Park14}.  As shown by \\citet{han08}, however,\nif the passage is close enough, then the shape of the lightcurve\nclearly distinguishes between these two cases: for the binary caustic\nthe interval is rounded, while for planetary caustics, the effect of\nthe central cusp tends to flatten the intervening lightcurve.\nHowever, for more distant passages, these weaker cusp approaches\nopen up the possibility of a new\nclass of degeneracy between central caustics due to binaries and\nplanets.\n\nHere we present ground and {\\it Spitzer} observations of\nOGLE-2015-BLG-1212. The ground observations show exactly two such\nbumps near peak, which could be due either to a binary or a planet.\nIn contrast to the cases analyzed by \\citet{han08}, however, the\npassage is too distant for the central cusp to create obvious\nfeatures that would distinguish between the planetary and binary\nsolutions.  While there remain subtle differences in the models that\npermit the ground-based data to distinguish between them at a\nmoderate level, these are at the level of occasional systematic\neffects in microlensing data.  However, the lightcurve obtained by\n{\\it Spitzer} from its vantage point well displaced from Earth\ndecisively confirms the preference of ground-based data for the\nbinary solution.\n\nThis result directly impacts the ability of {\\it Spitzer}\nobservations to measure the Galactic distribution of planets, which\nis one of the major goals of the {\\it Spitzer} microlensing program\n\\citep{spitzer2015prop}.  As shown by \\citet{21event} and\n\\citet{yee15}, one can determine the relative frequency of planets as\na function of distance from the Galactic center by comparing the\ncumulative distribution of planet sensitivity of microlensing events\nin the {\\it Spitzer} (or other space-based parallax samples) to that\nof the planets detected in these surveys.  An implicit assumption of\nthis approach is, however, that it is known whether a planet is\ndetected or not, given some specified criteria (e.g.,\n$\\Delta\\chi^2$).  In the present case, the event OGLE-2015-BLG-1212\nis high-magnification (and therefore has substantial\nsensitivity to planets, \\citealt{griest98,gould10}), and has strong\ndeviations from a \\citet{pac86} point-lens lightcurve (meaning that\n``something'' has clearly been detected).  However, without breaking\nthe planet/binary degeneracy, it would not be known whether this\n``something'' was a planet.  While it is possible in principle to\ntake statistical account of such ambiguous cases, they significantly\ndegrade the statistical power of the experiment, particularly because\nthe total number of planets detected in space-based microlensing\nsurveys is small.  Therefore, the fact that {\\it Spitzer} itself can\nresolve this degeneracy, at least in some cases, adds to its power to\ninvestigate the Galactic distribution of planets.\n\n\n\n{\\section{Observations}\n\\label{sec:obs}}\n\n\\subsection{OGLE Alert and Observations}\n\nOn 2015 June 1, the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment \\citep[OGLE,][]{OGLE}\nalerted the community to a new microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1212\nbased on observations with the 1.4 deg$^2$ camera on its\n1.3m Warsaw Telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile\nusing its Early Warning System (EWS) real-time event detection\nsoftware \\citep{ews1,ews2}.  Most observations were in $I$ band, but\nwith eight $V$ band observations during the magnified portion of the\nevent to determine the source color. At equatorial coordinates\n(17:52:24.79, $-29$:10:52.0), and Galactic coordinates\n$(0.56,-1.40)$, this event lies in OGLE field BLG500, which implies\nthat it is observed at roughly hourly cadence.\n\n\n\\subsection{{\\it Spitzer} Observations}\n\n\\citet{ob150966} have reviewed how the {\\it Spitzer} team applied\nthe strategy outlined in \\citet{yee15} to select {\\it Spitzer}\ntargets, so we do not repeat those discussions here.  We just summarize\nthat OGLE-2015-BLG-1212 was ``subjectively'' chosen for observations\non June 7 UT 23:49 (HJD=7181.498), shortly before the Monday upload.  It was\nassigned daily cadence but was observed about twice per day that week\n(beginning Thursday) due to a general shortage of targets near the\nbeginning of the program.  The following Monday (June 15) it was\nfound to meet the objective criteria for a rising event\n(\\citealt{yee15} criteria ``B''), meaning that all planets discovered\nfrom before the ``subjective'' alert could be incorporated into the\nsample, provided that a microlens parallax could be measured from the\npost-objective-alert observations. At this time, the $1\\,\\sigma$\nlower limit for the magnification during the next observing interval\nwas predicted to be $A>80$, which triggered an increase in the\ncadence to 8-per-day.  The following week, the\nevent returned to normal cadence, after which {\\it Spitzer}\nobservations were halted under provisions (``C'') specified by\n\\citet{yee15}, essentially that the ground-based lightcurve was well\noutside the Einstein ring. In fact, this decision was triggered by an\nerroneous estimate of the Einstein timescale $t_{\\rm E}\\sim 8\\,$days based\non automated point-lens fits to what was in fact a subtly anomalous\nlightcurve.  Nevertheless, since the erroneous fit reflected the true\nbrightness evolution (even though the wrong Einstein-ring position),\nit accurately foretold when the target would be too faint to usefully\nobserve, so that there was no loss of useful observations.\nAltogether, {\\it Spitzer} observed this event a total of 90 times,\neach with 6 dithered 30 s exposures \\citep{170event}\n\n\\subsection{Other Survey Observations}\n\n\\subsubsection{MOA Observations}\n\nMicrolensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA) independently\nidentified this event on 16 June and monitored it as MOA-2015-BLG-268\nusing their 1.8m telescope with $2.2\\,\\rm deg^2$ field at Mt.\\ John\nNew Zealand.  In contrast to most other observatories, which observe\nin $I$ band, MOA observes in a broad $R$-$I$ bandpass.  The MOA\ncadence for this field is 15 minutes.\n\n\\subsubsection{KMTNet Observations}\n\nThe event lies in one of four $4\\,\\rm deg^2$ fields monitored by\nKorea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet \\citep{KMTNet}) with roughly 15 minute\ncadence from its three 1.6m telescopes at CTIO/Chile, SAAO/South\nAfrica, and SSO/Australia.  Most KMTNet observations are in $I$\nband, although some $V$-band observations are taken to determine the\nsource color. The latter are not used in the present case, as being of poorer quality.\n\n\\subsubsection{Wise Observations}\n\n\nThe event lies inside the Wise microlensing survey footprint,\nwhich typically uses the 1m telescope at Wise Observatory, Israel \\citep{ShvMao12}.\nDue to readout electronics problems with the 1m telescope camera,\nas an alternative the Wise group used the Wise C18 0.46m telescope\nto monitor the survey fields, including OGLE-2015-BLG-1212.\nObservations were in $I$-band, with a cadence of $\\sim$1/hour.\n\n\\subsection{Followup Observations}\n\nIn general, the protocols of \\citet{yee15} discourage followup\nobservations of events with the extremely dense survey coverage\nlisted above, simply because there are more {\\it Spitzer}\nevents without dense survey coverage than can be adequately covered\nby available followup telescopes.  However, the high magnification\n(hence, high planet sensitivity) of OGLE-2015-BLG-1212 attracted\ndense coverage from several followup groups, particularly over the double peak.\n\n\\subsubsection{$\\mu$FUN CTIO Observations}\n\nThe Microlensing Follow Up Network ($\\mu$FUN) observed\nOGLE-2015-BLG-1212 using the dual channel ANDICAM camera mounted on\nthe 1.3m SMARTS telescope at CTIO. Observations started with one point at HJD=7186.9 and ended at 7190.8, concentrating on the last two nights covering the double peak hourly. Most of the optical-channel observations were in $I$ band, with 4 $V$-band observations taken\nnear peak in order to determine the source color.  All of the\ninfra-red channel data were in $H$-band. These, again, are primarily\nintended for source characterization and are not included in the\nfit.\n\n\\subsubsection{MiNDSTEp Observations}\n\nThe MiNDSTEp consortium observed OGLE-2015-BLG-1212 using the first\nroutinely operated multi-color instrument mounted on the Danish 1.54\nm telescope at La Silla and providing Lucky Imaging photometry. The\ninstrument itself consists out of two Andor iXon+ 897 EMCCDs and two\ndichroic mirrors splitting the signal into a red and a visual part\n\\citep{skottfelt15}. Observations started at HJD=7189.6 and were continued until 7194.8 with 90 minutes cadence.\n\n\\subsection{Data Reduction}\n\nAll ground based data were reduced using image subtraction\n\\citep{alard98} except for the $\\mu$FUN CTIO data, which was reduced\nwith DoPhot \\citep{dophot}. The {\\it Spitzer} data were reduced with\na new algorithm specifically developed for the {\\it Spitzer}\nmicrolensing campaign \\citep{170event}. For the analysis of this event, we used the light curve generated by method 3, as explained in that paper.\n\n{\\section{Lightcurve Analysis}\n\\label{sec:anal}}\n\nThe basic code used for the calculation of binary microlensing light\ncurves is the optimized contour integration routine developed by\n\\citet{Bozza10}. Since there is no caustic crossing, a detailed limb\ndarkening treatment is unnecessary for this event, and we can proceed\nassuming a uniform brightness profile (we have also explicitly checked that the conclusions are unchanged including limb darkening). A preliminary wide search in\nthe parameter space has been performed by the RTModel software\n\\footnote{http://www.fisica.unisa.it/gravitationAstrophysics/RTModel.htm},\ndesigned so as to interpret events in real time. After the best\npreliminary model has been obtained, we have re-normalized all error\nbars so that the total $\\chi^2$ equals the number of degrees of\nfreedom in the fit. More in detail, each dataset has been\nre-normalized so that its individual contribution to the $\\chi^2$\nis proportionate to the number of data points. We remind that the underlying assumption of this procedure is that the noise of all datasets is gaussian in nature.\n\nThe light curve of OGLE-2015-BLG-1212 can be obtained by several lens\nconfigurations. In particular, we have identified several solutions\nin the planetary regime ($q \\lesssim 0.01$) and others in the stellar\nbinary regime ($q \\gtrsim 0.01$). Figure~\\ref{fig:lc} shows the light curves\nobtained from all the observatories together with the best binary\nand planetary models.  The\nmagnitude scale corresponds to the calibrated $I$-band\nmagnitudes of the OGLE data. For all other observatories the\nmagnitudes shown actually represent the magnification, i.e.,\nequal ``magnitudes'' at different observatories represent equal\ninferred magnifications. Fig. \\ref{fig:caust} shows the corresponding caustic structures and\nsource trajectories\n(as seen from Earth and {\\it Spitzer}) for the two cases.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{Fig1fin.eps}\n\\caption{Lightcurve of OGLE-2015-BLG-1212 together with the best\nbinary (solid) and planetary (dashed) models, whose parameters are given in Table 1.\n}\n\\label{fig:lc}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nTable 1 gives the model parameters for the two solutions shown in\nthese figures. $u_0$ and $t_0$ are referred to the closest approach to the center of mass of the lens. Note that the planetary solution comes with a mass ratio of 0.002, which, depending on the primary mass, would correspond to a giant planet similar to Saturn. This fact makes this event an extremely interesting study case to test the ability of Spitzer to distinguish between a possible planetary discovery and a simple stellar binary.  As we explain below, each of the these two solutions\nis representative of a group of possible solutions, but it is\nimportant to begin by understanding these representative solutions\nfirst.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\hline & Binary & Planetary \\\\\n\\hline\n$s$ & 0.1760 & 1.5463 \\\\\n$q$ & 0.174 & 0.002423 \\\\\n$u_0$ & -0.01487 & -0.01488 \\\\\n$\\theta$ & 2.1386 & 1.4454 \\\\\n$\\rho$ & 0.0025 & 0.0019 \\\\\n$t_E$ & 40.22 & 43.6 \\\\\n$t_0$ & 7190.1980 & 7190.2313 \\\\\n$\\pi_\\perp$ & -0.0639 & -0.0575 \\\\\n$\\pi_\\parallel$ & -0.0043 & -0.00776 \\\\\n$\\chi^2$ & 7952.7 & 8066.1 \\\\\n\\hline\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Comparison of the best binary and the best planetary\nsolutions. $s$ is the separation between the two lenses in units of the Einstein radius; $q$ is the mass ratio; $u_0$ is the impact parameter to the lens center of mass in Einstein radii; $t_0$ (in HJD) is the time of closest approach to the center of mass, $\\theta$ is the angle (in radians) between the source velocity at time $t_0$ and the lens axis, $t_E$ (in days) is the Einstein time; $\\rho$ is the source radius in units of the Einstein radius.}\n\\end{table}\n\nModeling a caustic-crossing binary (or planet) requires at least\nseven geometric parameters to specify the magnification $A(t)$ as a\nfunction of time.

As illustrated in Figure~1 of\n\\citet{gould94}, the four-fold degeneracy\ncorresponds to (1) the source passing the lens on its right as seen\nfrom both Earth and the satellite\n($\\Delta\\beta_{++} = |u_{0,\\oplus}|-|u_{0,\\rm sat}|$), (2) both\npassing on its left\n($\\Delta\\beta_{--} = -|u_{0,\\oplus}|- (-|u_{0,\\rm sat}|)$), and (3,4)\npassing on opposite sides\n$(\\Delta\\beta_{+-}, \\Delta\\beta_{-+})$.  Note that the amplitude of\nthe parallax is the same for (1,2), and also the same for (3,4), but\ndifferent between the two pairs.  These identities are exact in the\napproximation of Equation~(\\ref{eqn:pieframe}) but broken (usually\nweakly) by higher order effects \\citep{gould95}.  In the case of\ncaustic-crossing binaries, this degeneracy can be strongly broken\nin some cases \\citep{graff02,ob151285}, although it may also\npersist,\nparticularly if there is only one caustic crossing observed from\nspace\n\\citep{ob141050}.  In the present case, since there are no caustic\ncrossings,\nwe do not expect these degeneracies to be strongly broken.  That is,\nthe situation is qualitatively similar to the point-lens case.\n\nFor the planetary model, there is also the close/wide degeneracy,\nwhich is very common for central caustics as first discussed by\n\\citet{griest98}.  Hence, for the planetary model, there are a total\nof $4\\times 2=8$ solutions.  For the binary model, the situation\nis more complicated.  As in the planetary case, there are both\nclose and wide models \\citep{dominik99,Boz00}.  However, because\nthe light curve features are in this case due to passage of\nconsecutive (rather than ``opposite'') cusps of the quadrilateral\ncaustic, there are in principle four possible orientations for the\ncaustic for the wide solutions  (compared to one in the planetary\ncase), and two possible orientations for the close solutions.  See\nFigures~2 and 4 of \\citet{liebig15}.\n\nIn the wide case, these four orientations may be thought of as either\nhaving the companion mass on the same side of the source trajectory\n(external cusp approach) or the opposite side (internal cusp\napproach), and in each case the companion mass may be passed by the\nsource either before or after the mass associated with the perturbing\ncaustic.\n\nIn the close case, there are in principle the same four orientations\nfor the caustic, but the companion mass is always on the same side of\nthe source trajectory.   Hence, two of these ``different''\norientations actually just represent different mass ratios (i.e.,\n$q\\rightarrow q^{-1}$), rather than different topologies.  Hence,\nthere are a total of $4\\times 2=8$ close solutions and $4\\times 4=16$\nwide solutions, and thus $8+8+16=32$ solutions altogether.\nThese are all shown in Table~\\ref{tab:allminima}, with cusp-approach\nnotation from\n\\citep{liebig15}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline\\hline\n \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Close Binary models} \\\\ \\hline  Cusps involved &\n $\\Delta\\beta_{\\pm\\pm}$ & $\\chi^2$ & $\\chi^2$ w/o Spitzer \\\\ \\hline\nA--C & $--$ & 7952.7 & 7846.2 \\\\\nA--C & $-+$ & 7955.1 & 7845.8 \\\\\nA--C & $++$ & 7953.0 & 7846.0 \\\\\nA--C & $+-$ & 7953.3 & 7845.7 \\\\\nC--A & $--$ & 8040.5 & 7912.8 \\\\\nC--A & $-+$ & 8040.3 & 7913.3 \\\\\nC--A & $++$ & 8040.3 & 7915.6 \\\\\nC--A & $+-$ & 8040.6 & 7915.9 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Wide Binary models} \\\\ \\hline  Cusps involved &\n $\\Delta\\beta_{\\pm\\pm}$ & $\\chi^2$ & $\\chi^2$ w/o Spitzer \\\\ \\hline\nA--B & $--$ & 7954.9 & 7858.0 \\\\\nA--B & $-+$ & 7958.6 & 7853.6 \\\\\nA--B & $++$ & 7954.7 & 7851.9 \\\\\nA--B & $+-$ & 7954.1 & 7857.3 \\\\\nB--A & $--$ & 8175.5 & 8042.2 \\\\\nB--A & $-+$ & 8172.0 & 8040.1 \\\\\nB--A & $++$ & 8166.6 & 8053.0 \\\\\nB--A & $+-$ & 8168.5 & 8046.4 \\\\\nD--B & $--$ & 8087.5 & 7984.5 \\\\\nD--B & $-+$ & 8099.8 & 7991.0 \\\\\nD--B & $++$ & 8088.2 & 7986.1 \\\\\nD--B & $+-$ & 8105.2 & 7991.1 \\\\\nB--D & $--$ & 8216.9 & 8100.1 \\\\\nB--D & $-+$ & 8225.8 & 8087.5 \\\\\nB--D & $++$ & 8211.7 & 8089.3 \\\\\nB--D & $+-$ & 8223.5 & 8096.8 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Planetary models} \\\\ \\hline  Topology &\n $\\Delta\\beta_{\\pm\\pm}$ & $\\chi^2$ & $\\chi^2$ w/o Spitzer \\\\ \\hline\nClose & $--$ & 8066.8 & 7926.0 \\\\\nClose & $-+$ & 8107.1 & 7926.1 \\\\\nClose & $++$ & 8066.8 & 7926.3 \\\\\nClose & $+-$ & 8108.4 & 7925.5 \\\\\nWide & $--$ & 8066.1 & 7901.5 \\\\\nWide & $-+$ & 8080.0 & 7898.1 \\\\\nWide & $++$ & 8066.3 & 7901.3 \\\\\nWide & $+-$ & 8083.9 & 7898.0 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{All relevant minima found with a comparison of the $\\chi^2$\nobtained including or excluding Spitzer data.

This would be regarded as significant evidence for\nthe binary solution, but not completely compelling due to the\npossibility of correlated errors in microlensing data.  See for\nexample the detailed investigation of one high-magnification event by\n\\citet{mb10311}, which they argued, are particularly prone to such\nsystematic errors.  However, {\\it Spitzer} data provide independent\nevidence of the correctness of the binary solution, raising the total\ndifference to $\\Delta\\chi^2=114$.  This seals the case.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{Figcompare.eps}\n\\caption{Comparison between the binary model (solid curve) and the planetary model (dashed curve) for the data acquired by ground observatories.\n}\n\\label{fig:compare}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Figdeltachi.eps}\n\\caption{$\\Delta\\chi^2$ between the planetary and the binary model as a function of time.\n}\n\\label{fig:deltachi}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:lc} the planetary model for the ground light-curve is practically indistinguishable from the binary one. However, we can clearly see that the Spitzer lightcurve is different in the two models. While the binary model predicts a smooth slightly asymmetric peak, the planetary model still preserves a concave structure between a main peak and a shoulder. The data point at HJD=7192, however, contradicts the existence of a main peak as suggested by the planetary model. This model also predicts lower magnification during the rising part, being further disfavored.\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:compare} zooms in the peak region as seen from ground observatories comparing the best binary and planetary models. In the double peak region, both models perform quite well. However, we note that before the peak, during the\nnight $7187.5<HJD<7188$, the data from OGLE,\nand KMTNet SAAO are too high above the planetary model, while\nafter the peak, during the night $7191.5<HJD<7192$, the points from OGLE, Danish and KMTNet CTIO are too low. The binary model fits the data much better.\nThis discrepancy is the primary origin of\nthe $\\Delta\\chi^2=53$ using ground data only. This is also evident from the plot of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ between the planetary and binary model (Fig. \\ref{fig:deltachi}), which shows big steps corresponding to these two nights.\nWe deduce that the planetary model forces the light curve to have an\nasymmetry not reproduced by the data. Nevertheless, the deviations\nfrom the model are still of the order of one sigma and could still be the outcome of some unknown systematics. The contribution by the Spitzer observations is decisive to\ndiscriminate between the two solutions. This\nexample clearly shows how observations from a different vantage point of the same event are extremely important to correctly classify an\nambiguous microlensing event.\n\nWe finally note that the best model fits the data so well that if any systematics are present they are well below the statistical error, thus supporting the work hypothesis of uncertainties dominated by random gaussian noise.\n\n{\\section{Physical Character of System}\n\\label{sec:phys}}\n\nThe principal goal of our investigation is to determine whether\nthe system is planetary or binary in nature because if the\nambiguity remained, this would degrade the measurement of the\nGalactic distribution of planets.  That is, the event is very\nsensitive to planets, so it is important to determine whether\nor not one was detected. As discussed in the previous section, this ambiguity is resolved by the Spitzer data in favor of the binary interpretation.\n\nHowever, the remaining degeneracies within the binary solution are\nquite severe and limit the complete characterization of the system.\nTables 3 and 4 contain full details of the four best close binary\nsolutions and the four best wide binary solutions respectively. The\nclose binary solutions arise from the source approaching cusp $A$\n(along the lens axis) and then cusp $C$ (off-axis cusp) of the\ncentral caustic. The wide solutions arise from the approach to cusp\n$A$ (on-axis) and then $B$ (off-axis) of the perturbed caustic of the\nheavier component. These caustics are very similar\n\\citep{dominik99,Boz00} and generate practically undistinguishable\nlight curves. In principle, continuing Spitzer observations for some\ntime after the main event would have probably helped constraining the\nexistence of a second bump at the closest approach with the caustic\nof the secondary object in the wide configuration.\n\n\nApart from the wide/close degeneracy, we also have the four-fold\nparallax degeneracy discussed in Section \\ref{sec:anal}. The symbols\n$--$, $-+$, $++$, $+-$ indicate the signs of $u_0$ for the source as\nseen from Earth and Spitzer respectively. All these eight solutions\nyield a nearly equal $\\chi^2$, as can be read from the last lines of\nTables \\ref{tab:close} and \\ref{tab:wide}, with a very slight\npreference for the close models by $\\Delta\\chi^2 \\sim 1$.\nInterestingly, all models provide an upper limit for the source\nradius parameter $\\rho=\\theta_*/\\theta_E$ of the order of 0.003,\nwhile only those solutions in which the source passes the caustic\nfrom the same side as seen from the Earth and Spitzer (indicated by\nthe symbols $++$ and $--$) are able to provide a lower limit as well. The\nresulting uncertainty is of the order $50\\%$, which, combined with\nthe $4\\%$ accurate parallax measurement obtained with Spitzer, is\nenough to constrain the lens mass and distance significantly. Note\nthat both components of the parallax vector are accurately measured,\nsomething that is seldom possible from Earth.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n\\hline\n &

the\nbasic microlensing parameters, we need a complete characterization of\nthe source involved in the microlensing event. A calibrated $(V,I)$\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD) has been obtained by CTIO observations, as\nshown in Fig. \\ref{fig:cmd}. In particular, the source magnitude is\none of the parameters of the fit, reported in Tables \\ref{tab:close}\nand \\ref{tab:wide}. The source color is obtained by linear regression\non CTIO observations, which have been taken in both colors on the\nnight $HJD=7189$. We have $V-I=1.54$. After locating the red clump\ncentroid in the CMD of Fig. \\ref{fig:cmd} at $(V-I,I)_{clump} =\n(1.93, 18.62)$ and calibrating with $(V-I,I)_{clump,0} = (1.06,\n14.42)$ from \\citet{nataf13}, we obtain a de-reddened source\n$(V-I,I)_{source,0} = (0.67, 17.87)$. This color index translates to\n$V-K=1.435$, using the relations in \\citet{bb88}. Finally, from\n\\citet{kervella04}, we find an angular radius $\\theta_*\\simeq 0.81\n\\mu$as for the best model. For each point in the Markov chains we can update this value with the parameters of each calculated model and\nderive accurate distributions for all secondary physical parameters.\n\nOnce we have the angular source radius, we can derive the Einstein\nangle, the proper motion, the total mass and the distance from the\nformulae\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 32170, "prevtext": "\nThe numerator of $\\pi_{\\rm E}$ gives the amplitude reflex deflection\nof the lens-source apparent position due to displacement by the observer of\n1 AU, while the denominator tells the size of\nthis deflection relative to the Einstein radius, which is what\ndetermines the impact on the light curve.

In any case, the lens distance distribution still peaks\n as far as 7.375 kpc, which suggests that the lens belongs to the bulge\nof our Galaxy.

Furthermore, prior expectations favor low-mass lenses, which\nare numerically more abundant than higher mass stars.\n\n\n\n{\\section{Conclusions}\n\\label{sec:conclude}}\n\nObservations by the Spitzer satellite are rapidly revolutioning the\nmicrolensing field. Traditional ground-based campaigns are\nplagued with degeneracies that often remain unsolved with\nobservations from our planet alone. As a consequence, for some\nmicrolensing events we cannot give a closed scientific\ninterpretation and we must\ncomplement the models by statistical arguments that combine prior\nexpectations from our knowledge of the Galaxy. The information on\nthe presence of planets in microlensing datasets can then be expressed\nin terms of probability, which weakens the impact of the potential\ndiscoveries.\n\nWith the advent of Spitzer, the situation has radically changed. In\nthis paper we have seen a clear example in which observations from a\nspacecraft far enough from the Earth provide the key to break even\nsome of the hardest degeneracies in microlensing. Thanks to Spitzer\ndata, for OGLE-2015-BLG-1212 we have been able to definitely exclude\nthe presence of a planet, which would have been allowed by ground\ndata alone. In the path toward the construction of a map of the\nplanets in our Galaxy, it is crucial that we have the highest\nconfidence in the interpretation of the microlensing events that we\naccept as basic bricks. We have shown that the combination of the ground-based and Spitzer observations is able to establish the nature of\nindividual microlensing events with unprecedented confidence.\n\nComing to the details of the modeling of this specific event, we also\nnote that the measure of such a weak parallax is only possible thanks\nto Spitzer and would be impossible using Earth observatories only.\nFurthermore, even though the source is not crossing any caustics, it\nis very interesting to note that we obtain an upper and a lower limit\nfor the source size for those models in which the source passes on\nthe same side of the caustic as seen from Earth and from Spitzer\n(models \"++\" and \"--\"). This is an unexpected bonus from the presence\nof a second probe of the lens plane. Although Spitzer goes further\nfrom the caustic, its light curve still constrains the model in a region of the parameter space in which the ground light curve is better fitted by requiring a minimal size of the source. Summing up, even in the limiting case\nof an event far in the bulge with a non-caustic crossing source\ntrajectory, Spitzer has been able to provide a parallax and an\nindication of the source size sufficient to have a clear and complete\nidea of the lens system. This is a unique occurrence in the history\nof microlensing observations.\n\nWith Spitzer observation campaigns, a new era has been opened for the microlensing field. This era is continuing in the next few years with the addition of precious observations by some more satellites already orbiting the Sun or that are being designed at present. In 2016 we will have the Campaign 9 of the K2 mission that will observe the bulge for three months \\citep{white}. The separation from Earth is a fraction of AU, thus being comparable to Spitzer's, but this satellite will operate in survey mode, with more than a hundred microlensing events expected. The presence of a sufficiently long baseline for some events will provide an important additional constraint that will be extremely useful in the analysis. If some events will be simultaneously observed from ground, K2 and Spitzer, we will have the incredible possibility to analyze events from three different points of view, which will dramatically reduce the possibilities for degeneracies to survive \\citep{SCNScarpetta}. All these observations are a stimulating anticipation of the WFIRST mission\\footnote{http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov}, which is specifically designed to perform microlensing searches ten years from now and that will likely yield several hundreds of microlensing planets \\citep{Yee14,ZhuGould}. The current design considers a geosynchronous orbit or the Lagrangian point L2. These options would provide a shorter baseline with respect to Spitzer or K2, which would be compensated by a much higher quality of the photometry. The era of microlensing from space has just begun.\n\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nOGLE Team thanks Profs. M. Kubiak and G.

satellite and\n$D_\\perp$ is the Earth-satellite separation projected on the sky.\n\nAs is well known, Equation~(\\ref{eqn:pieframe}) implies that for\neach geometry (as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:caust}), there are three other candidate solutions\n\\citep{refsdal66,gould94}. As illustrated in Figure~1 of\n\\citet{gould94}, the four-fold degeneracy\ncorresponds to (1) the source passing the lens on its right as seen\nfrom both Earth and the satellite\n($\\Delta\\beta_{++} = |u_{0,\\oplus}|-|u_{0,\\rm sat}|$), (2) both\npassing on its left\n($\\Delta\\beta_{--} = -|u_{0,\\oplus}|- (-|u_{0,\\rm sat}|)$), and (3,4)\npassing on opposite sides\n$(\\Delta\\beta_{+-}, \\Delta\\beta_{-+})$.  Note that the amplitude of\nthe parallax is the same for (1,2), and also the same for (3,4), but\ndifferent between the two pairs.  These identities are exact in the\napproximation of Equation~(\\ref{eqn:pieframe}) but broken (usually\nweakly) by higher order effects \\citep{gould95}.  In the case of\ncaustic-crossing binaries, this degeneracy can be strongly broken\nin some cases \\citep{graff02,ob151285}, although it may also\npersist,\nparticularly if there is only one caustic crossing observed from\nspace\n\\citep{ob141050}.  In the present case, since there are no caustic\ncrossings,\nwe do not expect these degeneracies to be strongly broken.  That is,\nthe situation is qualitatively similar to the point-lens case.\n\nFor the planetary model, there is also the close/wide degeneracy,\nwhich is very common for central caustics as first discussed by\n\\citet{griest98}.  Hence, for the planetary model, there are a total\nof $4\\times 2=8$ solutions.  For the binary model, the situation\nis more complicated.  As in the planetary case, there are both\nclose and wide models \\citep{dominik99,Boz00}.  However, because\nthe light curve features are in this case due to passage of\nconsecutive (rather than ``opposite'') cusps of the quadrilateral\ncaustic, there are in principle four possible orientations for the\ncaustic for the wide solutions  (compared to one in the planetary\ncase), and two possible orientations for the close solutions.  See\nFigures~2 and 4 of \\citet{liebig15}.\n\nIn the wide case, these four orientations may be thought of as either\nhaving the companion mass on the same side of the source trajectory\n(external cusp approach) or the opposite side (internal cusp\napproach), and in each case the companion mass may be passed by the\nsource either before or after the mass associated with the perturbing\ncaustic.\n\nIn the close case, there are in principle the same four orientations\nfor the caustic, but the companion mass is always on the same side of\nthe source trajectory.   Hence, two of these ``different''\norientations actually just represent different mass ratios (i.e.,\n$q\\rightarrow q^{-1}$), rather than different topologies.  Hence,\nthere are a total of $4\\times 2=8$ close solutions and $4\\times 4=16$\nwide solutions, and thus $8+8+16=32$ solutions altogether.\nThese are all shown in Table~\\ref{tab:allminima}, with cusp-approach\nnotation from\n\\citep{liebig15}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline\\hline\n \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Close Binary models} \\\\ \\hline  Cusps involved &\n $\\Delta\\beta_{\\pm\\pm}$ & $\\chi^2$ & $\\chi^2$ w/o Spitzer \\\\ \\hline\nA--C & $--$ & 7952.7 & 7846.2 \\\\\nA--C & $-+$ & 7955.1 & 7845.8 \\\\\nA--C & $++$ & 7953.0 & 7846.0 \\\\\nA--C & $+-$ & 7953.3 & 7845.7 \\\\\nC--A & $--$ & 8040.5 & 7912.8 \\\\\nC--A & $-+$ & 8040.3 & 7913.3 \\\\\nC--A & $++$ & 8040.3 & 7915.6 \\\\\nC--A & $+-$ & 8040.6 & 7915.9 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Wide Binary models} \\\\ \\hline  Cusps involved &\n $\\Delta\\beta_{\\pm\\pm}$ & $\\chi^2$ & $\\chi^2$ w/o Spitzer \\\\ \\hline\nA--B & $--$ & 7954.9 & 7858.0 \\\\\nA--B & $-+$ & 7958.6 & 7853.6 \\\\\nA--B & $++$ & 7954.7 & 7851.9 \\\\\nA--B & $+-$ & 7954.1 & 7857.3 \\\\\nB--A & $--$ & 8175.5 & 8042.2 \\\\\nB--A & $-+$ & 8172.0 & 8040.1 \\\\\nB--A & $++$ & 8166.6 & 8053.0 \\\\\nB--A & $+-$ & 8168.5 & 8046.4 \\\\\nD--B & $--$ & 8087.5 & 7984.5 \\\\\nD--B & $-+$ & 8099.8 & 7991.0 \\\\\nD--B & $++$ & 8088.2 & 7986.1 \\\\\nD--B & $+-$ & 8105.2 & 7991.1 \\\\\nB--D & $--$ & 8216.9 & 8100.1 \\\\\nB--D & $-+$ & 8225.8 & 8087.5 \\\\\nB--D & $++$ & 8211.7 & 8089.3 \\\\\nB--D & $+-$ & 8223.5 & 8096.8 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n \\multicolumn{4}{c}{Planetary models} \\\\ \\hline  Topology &\n $\\Delta\\beta_{\\pm\\pm}$ & $\\chi^2$ & $\\chi^2$ w/o Spitzer \\\\ \\hline\nClose & $--$ & 8066.8 & 7926.0 \\\\\nClose & $-+$ & 8107.1 & 7926.1 \\\\\nClose & $++$ & 8066.8 & 7926.3 \\\\\nClose & $+-$ & 8108.4 & 7925.5 \\\\\nWide & $--$ & 8066.1 & 7901.5 \\\\\nWide & $-+$ & 8080.0 & 7898.1 \\\\\nWide & $++$ & 8066.3 & 7901.3 \\\\\nWide & $+-$ & 8083.9 & 7898.0 \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{All relevant minima found with a comparison of the $\\chi^2$\nobtained including or excluding Spitzer data.

This would be regarded as significant evidence for\nthe binary solution, but not completely compelling due to the\npossibility of correlated errors in microlensing data.  See for\nexample the detailed investigation of one high-magnification event by\n\\citet{mb10311}, which they argued, are particularly prone to such\nsystematic errors.  However, {\\it Spitzer} data provide independent\nevidence of the correctness of the binary solution, raising the total\ndifference to $\\Delta\\chi^2=114$.  This seals the case.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=16cm]{Figcompare.eps}\n\\caption{Comparison between the binary model (solid curve) and the planetary model (dashed curve) for the data acquired by ground observatories.\n}\n\\label{fig:compare}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=10cm]{Figdeltachi.eps}\n\\caption{$\\Delta\\chi^2$ between the planetary and the binary model as a function of time.\n}\n\\label{fig:deltachi}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig. \\ref{fig:lc} the planetary model for the ground light-curve is practically indistinguishable from the binary one. However, we can clearly see that the Spitzer lightcurve is different in the two models. While the binary model predicts a smooth slightly asymmetric peak, the planetary model still preserves a concave structure between a main peak and a shoulder. The data point at HJD=7192, however, contradicts the existence of a main peak as suggested by the planetary model. This model also predicts lower magnification during the rising part, being further disfavored.\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:compare} zooms in the peak region as seen from ground observatories comparing the best binary and planetary models. In the double peak region, both models perform quite well. However, we note that before the peak, during the\nnight $7187.5<HJD<7188$, the data from OGLE,\nand KMTNet SAAO are too high above the planetary model, while\nafter the peak, during the night $7191.5<HJD<7192$, the points from OGLE, Danish and KMTNet CTIO are too low. The binary model fits the data much better.\nThis discrepancy is the primary origin of\nthe $\\Delta\\chi^2=53$ using ground data only. This is also evident from the plot of $\\Delta\\chi^2$ between the planetary and binary model (Fig. \\ref{fig:deltachi}), which shows big steps corresponding to these two nights.\nWe deduce that the planetary model forces the light curve to have an\nasymmetry not reproduced by the data. Nevertheless, the deviations\nfrom the model are still of the order of one sigma and could still be the outcome of some unknown systematics. The contribution by the Spitzer observations is decisive to\ndiscriminate between the two solutions. This\nexample clearly shows how observations from a different vantage point of the same event are extremely important to correctly classify an\nambiguous microlensing event.\n\nWe finally note that the best model fits the data so well that if any systematics are present they are well below the statistical error, thus supporting the work hypothesis of uncertainties dominated by random gaussian noise.\n\n{\\section{Physical Character of System}\n\\label{sec:phys}}\n\nThe principal goal of our investigation is to determine whether\nthe system is planetary or binary in nature because if the\nambiguity remained, this would degrade the measurement of the\nGalactic distribution of planets.  That is, the event is very\nsensitive to planets, so it is important to determine whether\nor not one was detected. As discussed in the previous section, this ambiguity is resolved by the Spitzer data in favor of the binary interpretation.\n\nHowever, the remaining degeneracies within the binary solution are\nquite severe and limit the complete characterization of the system.\nTables 3 and 4 contain full details of the four best close binary\nsolutions and the four best wide binary solutions respectively. The\nclose binary solutions arise from the source approaching cusp $A$\n(along the lens axis) and then cusp $C$ (off-axis cusp) of the\ncentral caustic. The wide solutions arise from the approach to cusp\n$A$ (on-axis) and then $B$ (off-axis) of the perturbed caustic of the\nheavier component. These caustics are very similar\n\\citep{dominik99,Boz00} and generate practically undistinguishable\nlight curves. In principle, continuing Spitzer observations for some\ntime after the main event would have probably helped constraining the\nexistence of a second bump at the closest approach with the caustic\nof the secondary object in the wide configuration.\n\n\nApart from the wide/close degeneracy, we also have the four-fold\nparallax degeneracy discussed in Section \\ref{sec:anal}. The symbols\n$--$, $-+$, $++$, $+-$ indicate the signs of $u_0$ for the source as\nseen from Earth and Spitzer respectively. All these eight solutions\nyield a nearly equal $\\chi^2$, as can be read from the last lines of\nTables \\ref{tab:close} and \\ref{tab:wide}, with a very slight\npreference for the close models by $\\Delta\\chi^2 \\sim 1$.\nInterestingly, all models provide an upper limit for the source\nradius parameter $\\rho=\\theta_*/\\theta_E$ of the order of 0.003,\nwhile only those solutions in which the source passes the caustic\nfrom the same side as seen from the Earth and Spitzer (indicated by\nthe symbols $++$ and $--$) are able to provide a lower limit as well. The\nresulting uncertainty is of the order $50\\%$, which, combined with\nthe $4\\%$ accurate parallax measurement obtained with Spitzer, is\nenough to constrain the lens mass and distance significantly. Note\nthat both components of the parallax vector are accurately measured,\nsomething that is seldom possible from Earth.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n\\hline\n &

the\nbasic microlensing parameters, we need a complete characterization of\nthe source involved in the microlensing event. A calibrated $(V,I)$\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD) has been obtained by CTIO observations, as\nshown in Fig. \\ref{fig:cmd}. In particular, the source magnitude is\none of the parameters of the fit, reported in Tables \\ref{tab:close}\nand \\ref{tab:wide}. The source color is obtained by linear regression\non CTIO observations, which have been taken in both colors on the\nnight $HJD=7189$. We have $V-I=1.54$. After locating the red clump\ncentroid in the CMD of Fig. \\ref{fig:cmd} at $(V-I,I)_{clump} =\n(1.93, 18.62)$ and calibrating with $(V-I,I)_{clump,0} = (1.06,\n14.42)$ from \\citet{nataf13}, we obtain a de-reddened source\n$(V-I,I)_{source,0} = (0.67, 17.87)$. This color index translates to\n$V-K=1.435$, using the relations in \\citet{bb88}. Finally, from\n\\citet{kervella04}, we find an angular radius $\\theta_*\\simeq 0.81\n\\mu$as for the best model. For each point in the Markov chains we can update this value with the parameters of each calculated model and\nderive accurate distributions for all secondary physical parameters.\n\nOnce we have the angular source radius, we can derive the Einstein\nangle, the proper motion, the total mass and the distance from the\nformulae\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\theta_E=\\frac{\\theta_*}{\\rho}; \\;\\; \\mu=\\frac{\\theta_E}{t_E}; \\;\\;\nM= \\frac{AU c^2}{4G} \\frac{\\theta_E}{\\pi_E}; \\; \\; D_L=\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_E\\pi_E}{AU} + \\frac{1}{D_S} \\right)^{-1}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\theta_{E}=\\frac{\\theta_{*}}{\\rho};\\;\\;\\mu=\\frac{\\theta_{E}}{t_{E}};\\;\\;M=%&#10;\\frac{AUc^{2}}{4G}\\frac{\\theta_{E}}{\\pi_{E}};\\;\\;D_{L}=\\left(\\frac{\\theta_{E}%&#10;\\pi_{E}}{AU}+\\frac{1}{D_{S}}\\right)^{-1}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>E</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>*</mo></msub><mi>\u03c1</mi></mfrac></mrow><mo rspace=\"8.1pt\">;</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>E</mi></msub><msub><mi>t</mi><mi>E</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo rspace=\"8.1pt\">;</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>U</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>E</mi></msub><msub><mi>\u03c0</mi><mi>E</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"8.1pt\">;</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>L</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>E</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c0</mi><mi>E</mi></msub></mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>U</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>S</mi></msub></mfrac></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
