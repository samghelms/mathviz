The scope of this work is to investigate the different and generalized cell association (CAS) strategies for Device-to-Device (D2D) communications in a cellular network infrastructure. To realize this,  we optimize D2D-based cell association by using the notion of uplink and downlink decoupling that was proven to offer significant performance gains. We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization framework to achieve efficient D2D cell association that minimizes the interference caused by D2D devices onto cellular communications in the uplink as well as improve the D2D resource utilization efficiency. Simulation results based on Vodafone's LTE field trial network in a dense urban scenario highlight the performance gains and render this proposal a candidate design approach for future 5G networks.  \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\begin{IEEEkeywords}\nCell association, decoupling, Device-to-Device, optimization, interference, resource utilization.\n\\end{IEEEkeywords}\n\n\n\\IEEEpeerreviewmaketitle\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe ever increasing cellular network traffic has led to a shift from single-tier homogeneous networks to multi-tier heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in an attempt to increase the network capacity in hotspots in an efficient and scalable way. The HetNet solution helps in improving the capacity of cellular networks and bringing the network closer to the user equipments (UEs). Device-to-Device (D2D) communication introduces similar benefits arising from the proximity of UEs to each others that is exploited by enabling direct communication between UEs without the need for the data to be routed via the fixed infrastructure network \\cite{Lin2014}.\n\nUntil the fourth generation of cellular networks, cell association has been based on the downlink (DL) received signal power only. It was shown in \\cite{Hisham2014} that associating both uplink (UL) and DL based on the DL received power in a HetNet is highly suboptimal and that the decoupling of both UL and DL results in substantial gains in the UL. D2D UEs are expected to have cellular and direct D2D communications in subsequent time instants or subframes. Therefore, D2D cell association needs to take the nature of cellular transmission into account. As per 3GPP \\cite{3gpp.36.843}, D2D communication will take place in the UL licensed band which makes the decoupled association strategy very relevant to the D2D cell association problem. To the best of our knowledge, cell association has been extensively studied in macro-cellular systems, but only recently in heterogeneous networks \\cite{Liu2014}. However, D2D-aware cell association is still an open issue for research and needs to be well investigated \\cite{Vlachos2015}.     \n\nThe aim of this proposal is to study the different cell association (CAS) strategies for inband D2D communications  in a heterogeneous network. D2D technology is expected to yield numerous overall benefits that mainly arise from the proximity gain they offer. Therefore, meticulous enhancements need to be included that will make full use of its merits. We focus on the inband overlay communication where D2D and cellular communications take part in the licensed frequency band and there is no overlap in resource block (RB) usage between D2D and cellular communication. The contribution of this work is the optimization of D2D-based cell association using the decoupled UL and DL association concept developed in prior art\\cite{Hisham2014}. To this end, integer linear programming (ILP) optimization tools are applied to introduce efficient D2D cell association that aims at minimizing the interference caused by D2D devices onto cellular communications as well as improve the efficiency of D2D resources usage.    \n\nConsidering the D2D communication paradigm, the interference management among D2D and cellular transmissions in inband is very challenging. Furthermore, commonly applied power control and interference management solutions within the literature usually resort to high complexity resource allocation methods, as stated in \\cite{Asadi2014}. D2D and decoupled uplink and downlink have been identified as main building blocks of future 5G networks in \\cite{BocHea14}. To this end, effective interference limitation with respect to resource utilization needs to be devised in order to improve the overall network welfare.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth,trim = 0 1cm 0 1cm, clip = true]{case_scenarios_2.pdf}\n  \\caption{Considered cell association scenarios: (a) Joint-Coupled, (b) Joint-Decoupled, (c) Disjoint-Decoupled. }\n\\label{CA_scenarios}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\section{Problem Description}\n\\label{Prob_form}\nThe principle aim of this section is to firstly give a glimpse of the investigated cell association techniques and then dive into detailed analysis of their realization.  \nAbiding by the milestones of LTE Release 12 and the prospective integration of D2D notion as a technological component to current and emerging networks, we present a number of general design assumptions according to up-to-date standardization working documents \\cite{3gpp.36.843}:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item D2D connections will utilize the uplink (UL) resources.\n\\item The inband scenario of D2D communications is taken into consideration, where the interference from D2D devices onto cellular links in a neighbouring cell (either Macro-eNB (MeNB) or Small-eNB (SeNB)) could be substantial.\n\\item The transmit power of D2D devices will be controlled by the serving cell (MeNB or SeNB) based on fractional path-loss compensation power control \\cite{3gpp.36.213} as done with cellular users.\nFormally speaking, the transmit power of a D2D device $u$ associated with BS $b$ is given by\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:tx_power}\nP_t^{lu} = min\\{P_{Max}, 10\\log_{10}(M) + P_0 + \\alpha L_{blu}\\},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"P_{t}^{lu}=min\\{P_{Max},10\\log_{10}(M)+P_{0}+\\alpha L_{blu}\\},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>u</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub><mo>,</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>10</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msub><mi>log</mi><mn>10</mn></msub><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>P</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>u</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05603.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nFurther, in order to view the problem of interference minimization caused by D2D UEs' potential transmissions, we need to define as $I_{bl} = mean\\big\\{I_{blu_1}, I_{blu_2} \\big\\}$ the average of the maximum interference generated by the two paired devices ($u_1$ and $u_2$ of link $l$) which are both associated with BS $b$.

Constraints \\eqref{eq:hybrid_decoupled_con1} and \\eqref{eq:hybrid_decoupled_con2} are defined as in problem \\eqref{eq:dis_decoupled_opt}. In \\eqref{eq:hybrid_decoupled_con3}, a threshold that constrains the levels of interference if the devices of a link are jointly connected to a BS is added. This threshold can act as a weighting factor to decide if the focus of the algorithm should be interference (low $I_{th}$) or resource efficiency (high $I_{th}$). For this constraint, we limit the search to the $n$ closest BSs to reduce the search space and consequently the complexity and size of the inequality matrix. Furthermore, constraint \\eqref{eq:hybrid_decoupled_con4} indicates that only if both devices of a link $l$ will be associated with the same BS $b$, the value of $z_{bl}$ variable equals to one (joint case). Lastly, \\eqref{eq:hybrid_decoupled_con5} stands for the restriction that each link's users can be associated with only one BS in the case of joint connection ($z_{bl} = 1$). Differently, they are disjointly connected to two separate BSs ($z_{bl} = 0$).\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Simulation setup}   \nAs deployment setup, we use the Vodafone LTE small cell test bed network deployment shown in Fig. \\ref{topology}. The test network covers an area of approximately one square kilometre and includes two Macro sites and 21 SeNBs represented by the black shapes and red dots respectively. We use this existing test bed to simulate a relatively dense HetNet scenario. The propagation model is based on a high resolution 3D ray tracing pathloss prediction model. This model takes into account clutter, terrain and building data and it guarantees a realistic and accurate propagation model. The user distribution is based on real traffic data extracted from the live network. \nWe assume an inband operation of D2D where D2D UEs use the same UL frequency band assigned for cellular transmission. However, D2D and cellular UEs are scheduled on different resources which is termed as 'overlay' operation in the literature.\nThe results are based on Monte Carlo simulations where the results are averaged over 100 simulation runs.\n\nThe operating frequency is 2.6 GHz. The maximum transmit powers of Mcells, Scells and UEs are 46, 30 and 23 dBm respectively. The fractional pathloss compensation power control algorithm in (\\ref{eq:tx_power}) is assumed with $P_0 = -90 $ dBm and $\\alpha = 0.8$. An average number of links of 336 is considered. $I_{th}$ is set to -130 dB. The next section features a set of results evaluating the proposed cell association methodologies proposed in Section \\ref{Prob_form}. Finally, we assume that each D2D pair is allocated one resource block (RB) per base station.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{map_2.jpg}\n\\caption{Vodafone Small cell LTE test network.}\n\\label{topology}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Simulation results}\nIn this section, a set of numerical evaluations is presented to investigate the proposed optimization schemes.  Fig. \\ref{mean_interf} shows the mean UL interference exerted by the D2D UEs onto cellular UL transmission against the D2D link length. The interference  values are normalized relative to the DD case to show the different interference levels compared to this interference optimal scheme. The JC and JD schemes show an increasing interference trend with the link length where the interference levels are around 3 dB (twice) and almost 6 dB (4 times) more than the DD scheme at 100 m and 150 m link length respectively. This is logical as the more the link length increases the more suboptimal the joint association schemes are as forcing distant devices to connect to the same BS results in a higher transmit power of these devices and a higher interference to neighbouring cells. The HD scheme introduces a trade-off between the Joint and DD schemes as it maintains an almost constant interference level that is around 1 dB higher than the DD scheme. This is due to the intelligence in the HD scheme that allows it to jointly/dis-jointly allocate D2D pairs depending on the interference level.\n\nAs explained earlier, if a D2D pair is served by one BS it is assumed to use only one RB over the whole network as this resource is reserved for this D2D pair in this BS only. However, if the devices of a pair are associated to different BSs then it is assumed that this pair is using two RBs over all the network since one RB has to be allocated for that pair in both BSs.\nFig. \\ref{resource_u} illustrates the average D2D resource usage per BS against the link length. The figure shows a constant resource usage for the JC and JD association schemes. This trend can be explained by the fact that the D2D pairs are jointly associated to the same BS regardless of the link length. Hence each D2D link uses 1 RB independent of the link length. However, the DD scheme shows an increasing RB usage with the link length.  This can be explained by the fact that the probability of disjoint association increases with the link length and so as the D2D resource usage in the whole network since the disjoint D2D link uses twice as much RBs as the joint one. The HD scheme -again- offers a compromise between the joint and disjoint schemes as the main scope of the optimization problem is to improve the resource usage efficiency with a constraint on the interference. The HD method achieves a reduction of resource usage of about 45\\% at 150 m link length compared to DD.\nThus, it can be noted that the HD scheme offers a trade-off between the UL interference and resource efficiency which can be controlled by setting the $I_{th}$ accordingly.\n \n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{mean_interf_newest.eps}\n\\caption{Mean UL interference from D2D devices onto cellular transmissions.}\n\\label{mean_interf}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the D2D UEs transmit power is shown in Fig. \\ref{Power_CDF}. The figure shows that the JC and DD schemes have the highest and lowest transmit power distributions with a difference of more than 5 dB at 50\\% of the CDF which increases the higher the transmit power is. The HD has a distribution that fits mid-way between the JC and JD distribution and that gets closer to the DD the higher the transmit power is. This shows that the HD scheme can result in a reduction of transmit power that varies between 3-5 dBs which is deemed crucial for battery powered devices.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{mean_resource_utilization_newest.eps}\n\\caption{Mean resource utilization for D2D per base station.}\n\\label{resource_u}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Power_CDF_newest.eps}\n\\caption{CDF of the devices' transmit power.}\n\\label{Power_CDF}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\nIn this paper, we presented different cell association strategies for D2D communications in cellular networks. Based on the notion of decoupled UL and DL connections, we proposed an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization framework that aimed at achieving efficient D2D cell association with respect to interference reduction as well as resource utilization. Extensive simulations show the significant gains of the applied methods. The Disjoint-Decoupled (DD) optimization technique achieves more than twice in UL interference reduction as well as more than 5 dBs reduction in devices transmit power compared to baseline cell association methods. However, DD results in an inefficient use of D2D resources.  Therefore, we introduced the Hybrid-Decoupled (HD) technique which achieves a balance between the interference reduction and resource utilization efficiency. HD results in a slightly worse interference performance than the DD scheme but with a 45\\% improvement in resource usage efficiency. We deem HD to be a strong candidate for future 5G cell association algorithms.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgment}\n\nThis research is co-funded by Vodafone Group R\\&D and CROSSFIRE MITN Marie Curie project (FP7-PEOPLE-317126). \n\n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}\n\n\\bibliography{decoupledD2D_references}\n\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17202, "prevtext": "\n Therefore, we propose a resource usage optimization problem that considers interference and formulate it as follows\n\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:hybrid_decoupled}\n\\text{max} \\:\\: \\sum_{b \\in B} \\sum_{l \\in \\mathcal{L}} z_{bl}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\text{max}\\&gt;\\&gt;\\sum_{b\\in B}\\sum_{l\\in\\mathcal{L}}z_{bl}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mpadded width=\"+4.4pt\"><mtext>max</mtext></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></munder><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u2112</mi></mrow></munder><msub><mi>z</mi><mrow><mi>b</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
