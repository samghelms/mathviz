We focused on a sample of 29 TeV $\\gamma$-ray\nemitting blazars with the best signal-to-noise X-ray observations\ncollected with {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV during  \n10\\,years of {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ operations. \\\\\nWe investigate the X-ray spectral shapes and the effects of different\ncorrections for neutral hydrogen absorption and decompose \nthe synchrotron and inverse Compton components.\nIn the case of 5 sources (3C\\,66A, S5\\,0716+714, W\\,Comae, 4C\\,+21.35 and BL\\,Lacertae) a superposition of both components is observed in the X-ray band,\npermitting simultaneous, time resolved studies of both ends of the electron\ndistribution.\nThe analysis of multi-epoch observations revealed that the break\nenergy of X-ray spectrum varies only by a small factor with flux changes.\nFlux variability is more pronounced in\nthe synchrotron domain (high-energy end of the electron distribution)\nthan in the Compton domain (low energy end of the electron distribution).\nThe spectral shape of the Compton domain is stable,  while the\nflux of the synchrotron domain is variable.\n These changes cannot be described by\nsimple variations of the cut-off energy, suggesting that the high-energy\nend of the electron distribution is not generally well-described by cooling\nonly.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\nRadiation mechanisms: non$-$thermal $--$ Galaxies: active $--$ BL Lacertae objects: general $--$ Galaxies: jets\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{intro}\nBL Lacertae (BL Lac) type objects as well as Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQ) constitute a class of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). \nIn a unified model,  these are the sources  characterized by polarized and highly variable non-thermal continuum emission observed from the jet pointing at small angles to the line of sight \\citep[e.g.,][]{begelman84}.  The radiation observed extends from radio wavelengths up to the X-ray regime, or even - in the case of the most energetic sources -  up to high and  very high energy $\\gamma$-ray range \\citep[e.g.][]{Wagner2009, Vercellone,  Aharonian13_0301, Abramowski2014}.\nThe emission observed from blazars is known to be variable at all wavelengths on different timescales down to hours or even minutes in the most extreme cases \\citep[e.g.][]{wagner,2155flare,Gopal-Krishna11,saito, Liao15}. Also, flux changes in blazars are often associated with spectral variability \\citep[e.g.][]{Xue06, Bottcher10, Gaur14}. \n\nThe spectral energy distribution (SED), in $\\nu$-$\\nu F_{\\nu}$ representation, shows in most cases two broad emission components. The  low energy peak is usually attributed to synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons from the jet, while the origin of the high-energy peak still remains  matter of debate. \nIn the most common leptonic scenarios, the high-energy bump is explained as inverse Compton radiation from  the same population of relativistic electrons scattering either the synchrotron photons \\citep[SSC, Synchrotron Self Compton models; e.g.][]{Maraschi92, Kirk98} or external photons from the surroundings, e.g. accretion disc, broad lines region or dust \\citep[EC, External Compton models: e.g.][]{Dermer92, Sikora94}. Alternatively, the high-energy peak can be explained in the framework of hadronic scenarios. \nIn this case  the high-energy radiation is produced in processes such   a proton synchrotron emission, synchrotron and Compton emission from secondary decay products of charged pions, or $\\pi_0$ decay \\citep{Aharonian00, Atoyan03, Mucke13, Bottcher13}.\nAdditionally,  \\cite{Petropoulou2015} have shown that Bethe-Heitler emission can explain SED of blazars in the case when the  typical double-humpted structure is not clearly visible. \n\n\n\nDepending on the frequency of the low-energy peak, BL Lac type blazars can be subdivided into high-, intermediate- and low-energy peaked objects: HBL, IBL, LBL, respectively \\citep[see, e.g.,][]{padovani95,fossati98,Abdo2010}. For LBL type blazars the synchrotron peak is located in the infrared regime  ($\\nu_{s}\\leq10^{14}$\\,Hz), for IBL blazars in the optical-UV range ($10^{14}$\\,Hz$<\\nu_{s}\\leq10^{15}$\\,Hz), while for HBL blazars in the X-ray domain ($\\nu_{s}>10^{15}$\\,Hz) \\citep{Abdo2010}. It has been proposed  and connected with decreasing bolometric luminosities and $\\gamma$-ray dominance by \\cite{fossati98}. According to the blazar sequence, HBL blazars are  synchrotron dominated, while FSRQs are $\\gamma$-ray dominated. In the later work the concept of the blazars sequence has been updated with a large sample of radio-loud AGNs to the blazars envelope \\citep{Meyer11}.\n\nThe different classes of blazars could also be distinguished according to the location of the X-ray spectrum in SED. \nFor HBL type blazars the X-ray spectrum is usually located in the synchrotron domain.\nWhile in the case of  IBL type sources the X-ray emission usually covers both synchrotron and inverse Compton component. For several IBL type sources the upturn of SED located in the X-ray domain has been reported e.g.  BL~Lacertae \\citep{Tanihata00,Ravasio02,Donato05}, W~Comae \\citep{Tagliaferri00, Donato05}, S5~0716+71 \\citep{Cappi94,Giommi99,Tagliaferri03,Donato05,Ferrero06, Wierzcholska_s5_2015}, AO~0235+16 \\citep{Raiteri06}, OQ~5310 \\citep{Tagliaferri03}, 3C~66A \\citep{Donato05}. LBL type objects are usually characterised with the X-ray spectrum covering the inverse Compton bump.\n\n\n\nThe X-ray observations of the brightest HBL type blazars unfolded strong variability often  with large amplitude of variations, observed on long as well as on short timescales \\citep{Sembay93, Tanihata00, Sembay02, Zhang02, Zhang2005}. In several mentioned cases HBLs variability amplitudes have been also found to be correlated with the energy. Furthermore, HBL blazars are known for ``harder-when-brighter'' behaviour manifested in hardening of spectral index with the increasing flux level observed \\citep[e.g.][]{Pian98, Zhang2005, Zhang06b, Abramowski2012_2155}.\n\nThe X-ray variability studied in different energy bands seem to be correlated, often with  time-lags of a few hours. Usually variations observed in lower energies have lags behind those at higher energies (so-called soft time-lags), but the opposite (so-called hard time-lags) are also observed \\citep[e.g.][]{Zhang06b,Fossati2000}.\nFurthermore, the comparison of X-ray spectral index ($\\alpha$) and flux intensity (I) presented in a $\\alpha$-I plots reveals clockwise (for soft time-lags) or counter-clockwise (for hard time-lags) patterns \\citep[e.g.][]{Takahashi96, Ravasio04, Brinkmann05}. The time-lags are directly related with changes of acceleration and cooling time scales \\citep{Kirk98}.\n\nThe X-ray variability observed in the case of IBL and LBL type objects show similar behaviour according  to the variability time scales and amplitudes observed for HBL type blazars.  But, for these classes of blazars, as opposed to HBL type ones, the variability amplitudes seem to be anticorrelated with the emission energy \\citep[e.g.][]{Giommi99, Ravasio02}. \nFurthermore, in mentioned studies no time-lags between  the low and the high energy X-ray emission has been observed. \n\nPrevious studies focusing on the nature of the X-ray spectra disclosed its complex nature and several authors discussed features of blazars behaviour in this domain.\n\\cite{Worrall90} analysed  large sample of BL Lac type blazars observed with \\textit{Einstein} which were well described with the single {power-law}\\ model with a wide range of spectral indices. This model as well as  the {broken power-law}\\ one were also successfully used to describe the X-ray spectra in the later works for data collected with  different  instruments like  ASCA \\citep[e.g.][]{Kubo98}, \\textit{Beppo}SAX \\citep[e.g.][]{Wolter98,Padovani01, Padovani04}, HEAO-1 \\citep[e.g.][]{Sambruna94} and ROSAT observations \\citep[e.g.][]{Perlman96b, Urry96, Sambruna96}.\n\nAlternatively, in a several works  the X-ray spectra are well described with the curved {log-parabola}\\ model.\n\\cite{Inoue96, Tavecchio98, Giommi02, Donato05} studied the X-ray observations of blazars performed with \\textit{Beppo}SAX and  found this model as preferable for at least 50$\\%$ of the sources analysed. \nIn the later studies   \\cite{Massaro04b, Massaro04a, Massaro06} analysed the X-ray spectra for Mrk\\,421 and Mrk\\,501  and found the {log-parabola}\\ as the best model for characterization of their spectra in different activity states. The authors also suggested a possible interpretation of the mentioned model in term of statistical  particle acceleration with the assumption that the probability of the increase of particles energy is a decreasing function of an energy. \nFurthermore \\cite{Massaro08} enlarged their sample to 15 objects and found the {log-parabola}\\ as the best model for most of the blazars spectra studied.\n\nThe mentioned studies revealed that the X-ray spectra are characterized with a wide range of spectral indices.\nFollowing the distributions presented by \\cite{Donato05}, which are consistent with the previous and the later studies by e.g. \\cite{Perlman05, Tramacere07, Massaro08}, the X-ray spectral indices of HBL type blazars are between $\\Gamma_X=1.8$ and $\\Gamma_X=3.0$, for LBL type objects this quantity is between  $\\Gamma_X=1.5$ and $\\Gamma_X=1.8$, while in the case of FSRQs, spectra are best described with the spectral indices between $\\Gamma_X=1.0$ and $\\Gamma_X=2.0$.\n\nThe motivation of this work is to test if the X-ray spectra observed with {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV are well described with the single {power-law}\\ model or the continuously curved {log-parabola}. Both characteristics are reasonable and widely discussed in the context of models used for description of synchrotron ageing and acceleration processes \\citep[e.g.][]{Leahy91, Massaro04b, Massaro04a}. Also, we would like to check for how many of selected TeV emitting blazar the X-ray regime is a place, where the low- and the high-energy spectral component meet or if the X-ray spectral shape allows us to predict where this point for particular blazars is located in broadband SED. \nFinally, different values of the Galactic column absorption provided in several surveys \\citep[][]{Dickey90, Kalberla05, Willingale13} give us reason to study, which values are preferable and how changes in the Galactic column density values influence the X-ray spectral properties. \n\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission is described in Sect.~\\ref{swift}, while Sect.~\\ref{sample} gives information about the sample selection and data analysis. All selected sources are described in Sect.~\\ref{catalogue}. Sect.~\\ref{variabilitysl} focusses on 5 blazars, for which an upturn point is visible in the X-ray regime. The work is summarized in Sect.~\\ref{discussion}.\n\n\\section{The Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission}\\label{swift}\nThe Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission (hereafter \\textit{Swift})  \\citep{Gehrels04}, launched in November 2004, is a multi-wavelength space observatory, equipped with three instruments: the Burst Alert Telescope \\citep[BAT,][]{Barthelmy05}, the X-ray Telescope \\citep[XRT,][]{Burrows05} and the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope \\citep[UVOT,][]{Roming05}.  {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ operates in the energy range of  0.3-10\\,keV.\n\nThe XRT detector can be operated in different modes: the Windowed Timing (WT), the Photon Counting (PC) and the Imaging (IM); the forth - Photo-Diode mode - is not working since May 2005. In the PC mode the full CCD chip is read out every 2.5 seconds and it is used for sources with count rate smaller than 1\\,count per second. Observations provided in this mode have full imaging and spectroscopic resolution.\nThe WT mode is characterized by 1.7\\,ms time resolution and full energy resolution. The mode is usually used to observe the sources with count rate larger than 1\\,count per second. During the monitoring of a chosen source, the detector can switch between the PC and the WT mode, to optimize the observations.\nThe third, Imaging mode is used only to obtain the first X-ray position of a newly detected Gamma Ray Burst. \n\n\\section{Sample selection and data analysis}\\label{sample}\nThe catalogue of TeV sources (TeVCat\\footnote{\\url{http://tevcat.uchicago.edu/}}) includes 161\\footnote{The number of objects collected in catalogue up to June 2015.} objects and 58 of them are classified as blazars. All of the blazars were observed several times with {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}. The main properties of the TeV blazars, as well as the total exposure in the PC mode and integrated flux for the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV obtained using the online analysis of {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ data \\citep{Evans09} are collected in Table\\,\\ref{table_tevblazars}. Since the aim of this work is to focus on properties of the average  X-ray spectra for particular blazars,  the further analysis has been limited to objects with the best {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ data  for which\nthe product of the integrated flux and the exposure is greater than 3.0\\,$\\cdot$10$^{-10}$\\,erg\\,cm$^{-2}$. \n\nThis allowed to single out 29 objects with high signal-to-noise level, and for which {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ data allow to obtain good-quality spectra. The sources chosen are marked in the last column in Table\\,\\ref{table_tevblazars}. One object, namely, IC\\,310, fullfilled our criteria but it is not included in our sample, since in the literature it is not classified as a blazar, but as a radio-galaxy or a transition object between radio galaxy and BL Lac type source \\citep[e.g.][]{Kadler_2012, Aleksic_ic310_2014}.\n\nThis study is limited to  observations taken in the PC mode, since data taken in the WT mode are affected by charge redistribution problems inherently related to the way in which the CCD of the instrument is read. These depend on the position of the source on the CCD before\nbinning the read out on a 10\\,pixel basis and makes the response position-dependent.\nThe effect is small for mildly absorbed sources, but in this study we focus on long time integrated spectra, so  a number of photons is huge and it can be seen as an  impact on the residuals in spectra.\\footnote{Private communication by Sergio Campana.}\nThe effect was also noticed in {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ observation in WT mode by e.g. \\cite{Massaro08}. \n\nFor 29 selected blazars {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ data were analysed using HEASoft package v.\\,6.16 software\\footnote{\\url{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft}} with CALDB v.\\,20140120. \nAll events are cleaned and calibrated  using the \\verb|xrtpipeline| task. Data in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV with grades 0-12 are analysed. \nFor the spectral studies, data are grouped using the \\verb|grappha| tool to have a minimum 20 counts per bin  and the co-added spectra are fitted using XSPEC v.\\,12.8.2 \\citep{Arnaud96}.\n\nIn the first step two models were used to fit {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ spectrum:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item a single power-law defined as\n \n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dN}{dE}=N_p  \\left( \\frac{E}{E_0}\\right)^{-{\\Gamma}},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{dN}{dE}=N_{p}\\left(\\frac{E}{E_{0}}\\right)^{-{\\Gamma}},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>E</mi><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07493.tex", "nexttext": "\n with the Galactic absorption.\n \\end{itemize}\nHere, the {power-law}\\ model is characterized by the normalization $N_p$ and the spectral index $\\Gamma$ (at energy  $E_0$), while the {log-parabola}\\ model is described with the normalization $N_l$ and the curvature parameter $\\beta$ and the spectral index $\\alpha$ (at energy  $E_0$). \nIn both cases the scale energy $E_0$ is fixed at 1\\,keV. \nIn each case  four different values of the Galactic absorption parameter are tested:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item N$_{H}^{LAB}$ taken from the Leiden Argentine Bonn Survey \\citep[LAB,][]{Kalberla05}.

This parameter is important in the case of blazars for which the X-ray spectrum covers both synchrotron and inverse Compton components. \nSince BL\\,Lacertae is known to have a spectral upturn located in the X-ray domain \\citep[e.g.][]{Tanihata00, Ravasio02}, we also decided to fit the spectrum of this blazars with the {broken power-law}\\ model. \n\nFor  all the models mentioned the fitting method in XSPEC is set to \\verb|leven|, a minimization\nmethod using the modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm \\citep{Marquardt63, bevington2003data}.\n\n\n\\section{The  {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ spectral catalogue}\\label{catalogue}\nFollowing the procedure described in Sect.~\\ref{sample} for 29 selected objects {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ spectra has been fitted with log-parabola and power-law models. The fit parameters for the {log-parabola}\\ and the {power-law}\\ fits are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fitpar_lp} and Table~\\ref{table_fitpar_po} (in the online material), respectively. Since the {log-parabola}\\ and the {power-law}\\ are nested models, the goodness of both fitted models  is compared using the F-test \\citep[e.g.][]{bevington2003data}. The test statistics value as well as the corresponding probability are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fitpar_po} (in the online material).\nFor the additional analysis with the {broken power-law}\\ model the spectral fit parameters are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fitpar_bk} (in the online material).\n\nSpectral fits for the {log-parabola}\\ and the {power-law}\\ models are presented in Fig.~\\ref{seds_lp} and  Fig.~\\ref{seds_po} (in the online material). Both figures presents data points fitted with  {N$_H$}\\ value from the LAB survey. Four  models are presented for each blazar with colours denoting four different {N$_H$}\\ values: red is used for the {N$_H$}\\ value taken from \\cite{Kalberla05} survey, blue for the one from \\cite{Dickey90}, magenta for the {N$_H$}\\ value from \\cite{Willingale13} and green for the free {N$_H$}\\ value. Figures  \\ref{spec_1}--\\ref{spec_5} (in the online material) show  spectra for all selected 29 objects and data shown in the figures are always fitted with the {log-parabola}\\ model with the {N$_H$}\\ value taken from the LAB survey.\n\nDifferent models and {N$_H$}\\ values tested lead to the conclusion that in the most cases of TeV $\\gamma$-ray emitting blazars studied the preferable description of the X-ray spectrum is the {log-parabola}\\ model. Only in the cases 1ES\\,1101-232, Mrk\\,180 and PKS\\,2005-489,  the F-test values imply that the average spectrum is best fitted  with a single {power-law}\\ model.\n\nThe preferable fits do not allow us to distinguish a best, universal {N$_H$}\\ value, which could be used in all cases. \nIn the sample of 29 sources we found that the values taken from LAB, \\cite{Willingale13}, \\cite{Dickey90} are preferable in 6, 8, 5 sources, respectively, \n while in the other 10 cases, a free {N$_H$}\\ value provides the best {$\\chi_{red}^2$} result. The selection of the preferable model and {N$_H$}\\ value was based not only on the fit to the X-ray data characterised with  $\\chi_{red}^2$, but also in divergent cases we investigate the shape of the fitted spectrum in the context of the overall broadband spectral energy distribution built from archival data\\footnote{\\url{http://www.asdc.asi.it/}}.\nIn the sample studied there are a few objects (such like PKS\\,0548-322, H\\,1426+428 or PKS 2155-304) for which   different {N$_H$}\\ value  result in a very similar X-ray spectral curvature. But there are also several cases for which different surveys provide different Galactic column density values, which result in very different spectral curvatures. \nAn  extreme example is  1ES\\,0033+595 (see in Fig.~\\ref{seds_lp}).\nIn several cases spectra with very different characterisations are fitted with very similar values of {$\\chi_{red}^2$}.\n\n\nIn our collection of 29 X-ray spectra we found that the shape of spectra is characterised with $\\alpha$ or $\\Gamma$ (depending on the preferred model of the spectrum) in the range  1.3-2.6. \nFor the fit with a {log-parabola}\\ model the curvature parameter $\\beta$ lies between $-0.100$ and $-0.347$ for the concave curved spectra and between 0.066 and 0.477 for the convex curved spectra. \nBelow, main properties of the X-ray spectra for the selected 29 objects in the context  of our and previous studies are discussed: \n\n\\subsection{Notes on individual objects}\n\n\\paragraph*{1ES\\,0033$+$595:}\nThe {X-ray spectrum}\\ of this blazar is well described with the {log-parabola}\\ model ($\\chi_{red}^2\\sim1.0$). The {power-law}\\ fits result in $\\chi_{red}^2\\sim1.8$ and it is less favoured. Comparing different values of the Galactic column density, we conclude that the best fit to data is obtained using fixed {N$_H$}\\ value provided by \\cite{Willingale13} or with free {N$_H$}\\  value. A low value of {N$_H$}, e.g. from \\cite{Kalberla05} or \\cite{Dickey90}, causes an artificial bump in the synchrotron component in SED. 1ES\\,0033+595 is an extreme example of a source for which different {N$_H$}\\ values used result in significant changes in the spectral shapes, while $\\chi_{red}^2$ values differ only slightly. \n\nPrevious studies of the X-ray observations of 1ES\\,0033$+$595 with \\textit{Beppo}SAX by \\cite{Giommi02} also favour the  {log-parabola}\\ model for the description of the {X-ray spectrum}, with $\\alpha=1.4$ and $\\beta=0.4$. These results are consistent with the ones obtained in this paper in the case of {log-parabola}\\ fit with {N$_H$}\\ value taken from \\cite{Willingale13}.\n\\cite{Donato05} claimed a {power-law}\\ as a good model for later \\textit{Beppo}SAX observations with spectral index of $\\Gamma=2.1$ and free {N$_H$}\\ value significantly smaller than {N$_H$}\\ values from discussed surveys. \n\n\\paragraph*{RGB\\,J0136$+$391:}\nThe X-ray spectrum of the blazar is well characterized with the {log-parabola}\\ model with all {N$_H$}\\ values tested or with the {power-law}\\ with free {N$_H$}\\ value and the one provided by \\cite{Willingale13}. The preferable fits result in {$\\chi_{red}^2$}\\ of about 0.9, while in the latter case {$\\chi_{red}^2$}\\ is about 1.3.\n\\cite{Donato01} found single {power-law}\\ with free {N$_H$}\\ value as the favourable model for this source.   \n\n\n\\paragraph*{3C\\,66A:} \nThe X-ray spectrum for the blazar is best described with the {log-parabola}\\ model ($\\chi_{red}^2\\sim$0.95). For the comparison the {power-law}\\ model fitted to data result in $\\chi_{red}^2\\sim$1.1-1.2.\n Negative values of the $\\beta$ parameter in all {log-parabola}\\ fits confirm the concave curvature of the fitted model and indicate that the turning point of SED is located in the {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ energy range.

The results mentioned suggest that PKS\\,2155$-$304 can be a rare example of HBL type blazar for which possible up-turn point of SED is found in soft X-ray regime. \nHowever previous studies with  \\textit{Beppo}SAX observations of the source were well  described with the single {power-law}\\ or the convex {broken power-law}\\ model \\citep[e.g.][]{Zhang99, Chiappetti99, Zhang02}.\n\nAlso during the  multi-wavelength studies targeting the low state of the blazar X-ray spectrum was well characterized with the {broken power-law}\\ model \\citep{Aharonian09_2155}. \nDetailed, longterm spectral studies, including observations of the blazar obtained during the period of 2005-2012 with XMM-Newton has been successfully described with the {log-parabola}\\ model \\citep{Kapanadze14}.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph*{BL\\,Lacertae:}\nThe X-ray  spectrum of this blazars can be well fitted with the {power-law}\\ as well as with the {log-parabola}\\ model, but in both cases with free value of the Galactic absorption parameter and the one provided by \\cite{Willingale13}.\nIn the case of the X-ray spectrum of BL\\,Lacertae different values of {N$_H$}\\ tested, for the {power-law}\\ as well as the {log-parabola}\\ models, result in diametrically different values of the spectral and curvature parameters.\n Visual inspection of data suggests the curvature in the X-ray domain, but it is difficult to quantify, due to the high dispersion of data points in low energy part of the spectrum. For the preferable fits {$\\chi_{red}^2$} is about 1.1-1.2. \n\nPrevious studies on this blazar's spectrum in the X-ray energy band disentangle synchrotron and inverse Compton components in this range. \\cite{Tanihata00} found that for the blazar in the energy range below 1\\,keV a soft and steep spectrum is dominating, in contrast to hard component otherwise.\n\\cite{Ravasio02} reported two periods of observations of the blazar in 1999.

The synchrotron peak frequency during such events is at 10\\,keV or above, which classifies the source as the so-called extreme HBL.\n\n\n\\section{Blazars with upward-curved X-ray spectra}\\label{variabilitysl}\n\nIn the further studies we focus on five blazars for which a concave curvature of the spectrum suggests that  both synchrotron and inverse Compton components are located in the X-ray regime. This gives a perfect opportunity to study spectral and temporal variability of both components contemporaneously. \n\n\n\nIn the first step the longterm background-subtracted light curves for each source were inspected (upper panels of Fig.~\\ref{lc_3c66a}-\\ref{lc_4c2135}). In each case the presented light curves  show observations from 2005 up to October 2014 collected with {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ in the PC mode in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV. Each light curve is binned in observation-length intervals.\n\n\nIn order to separate synchrotron and inverse Compton components we define the upturn energy (E$_{upt}$)  being identical to the break energy value taken from the {broken power-law}\\ fit, which is given in Table~\\ref{table_fitpar_bk}. We define two energy bands for each source. The soft band in the energy range (0.3\\,keV, $E_\\textit{upt}$) and the hard energy band ($E_\\textit{upt}$, 10\\,keV). \nNote that $E_\\textit{upt}$ is kept constant for each source throughout the 10 years period. The variations in both bands and of the hardness ratio (HR), defined as the proportion of the count rate in the  hard and the soft band, are shown in Fig.~\\ref{lc_3c66a}-\\ref{lc_4c2135}.\n\n\n\n\\paragraph*{3C\\,66A:}\nThe light curve (see upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{lc_3c66a}) shows variability manifested mainly in one outburst in 2008. \nThe flux changes are characterized by a fractional variability amplitude \\citep[][]{Edelson88}  $F_\\textit{var}=(67 \\pm 2) \\%$ with the uncertainty calculated following \\cite{Vaughan03}. Except for this outburst (with a count rate of $\\sim0.7$\\,count/s) the source flux level observed in different epochs  is about 0.1-0.2 counts/s. \nThe soft and the hard X-ray light curves  in the energy bands of 0.3-3.4\\,keV and 3.4-10\\,keV, respectively are shown in Fig~\\ref{lc_3c66a}. \nThe fractional variability amplitudes  for the soft and hard bands are following: $F_\\textit{var}=(69 \\pm 2) \\%$ and $F_\\textit{var}=(56 \\pm 1) \\%$, respectively. \nThe hardness ratio is characterized by a fractional variability amplitude of $F_\\textit{var}=(28 \\pm 1) \\%$.\nHence, the most pronounced variability is observed in the soft energy band. \n\n\nTo investigate the spectral variability of 3C\\,66A in detail, spectra have been obtained during\nthree intervals, shown in Fig.~\\ref{lc_3c66a}. \nThe division  takes into account the exposure for spectral analysis in  each interval and the range of different flux levels for the source. \nThe assumes a monotonous change of spectral properties with the total flux even if several distinct flares are coadded. \nIn the first interval there are only two observations performed in 2005, but the second one has an exposure of 52\\,ks.\nFor each of the selected intervals, data are fitted with the {broken power-law}\\ model with the Galactic absorption ({N$_H$}\\ value taken from LAB survey), which  describe the overall spectrum well.\nThe spectral parameters are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fits}.\nThe  plots presenting SEDs for all intervals are shown in Fig.~\\ref{seds_breaks}.\nIn Sect.~\\ref{catalogue} it was shown that  the average spectrum  is characterised by concave curvature and an  upturn energy of about 3.4\\,keV. This value is an average one and the soft and hard intervals selected in Fig.~\\ref{lc_3c66a} do not reflect precisely the synchrotron and the inverse Compton components for all times\nThe concave shape of the spectrum is clearly visible in the first interval. For the other intervals the upturn is not visible and the spectrum in the energy band  presents only a synchrotron component. Since the third epoch display the source at a fainter state compared to the first one, the absence of an upturn implies flux variability of the inverse Compton component. \n\nFigure~\\ref{flux_hr} presents the comparison of the hardness ratio and the total count rate. \nThere is no clear trend between these quantities. The soft spectral state is observed in bright or faint, while\nthe hard state of the  source is for faint state. \n\n \n\n\n\\paragraph*{S5\\,0716+714:}\nThe source, known for its variability, clearly manifests this feature in the longterm light curve presented in the upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{lc_s50716}.\nThe middle panels of Fig.~\\ref{lc_s50716}  shows the  hard and soft light curves, for which the energy bands are defined as 1.1-10\\,keV and 0.3-1.1\\,keV, respectively.\nThe longterm variability is  characterized by fractional variability amplitude for the total, soft and hard bands resulting in $F_\\textit{var}=(61 \\pm 1) \\%$, $F_\\textit{var}=(75 \\pm 1) \\%$ and $F_\\textit{var}=(52 \\pm 1) \\%$, respectively. For the comparison the hardness ratio light curve (see bottom panel in Fig.~\\ref{lc_s50716}) results in $F_\\textit{var}=(22 \\pm 2) \\%$. Then, the most prominent variability is observed in the soft energy range.  \n\nTo study the spectral variability we divide the light curve into four intervals (see Fig.~\\ref{lc_s50716}).\nThe first interval includes only two observations, but the first one has the time exposure of 19\\,ks. \nEach of the spectrum, for selected intervals, can be well characterized with the {broken power-law}\\ model with the Galactic absorption {N$_H$}\\ value from DL survey. The spectral parameters are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fits} and the corresponding plots are shown in Fig.~\\ref{seds_breaks}. All the selected intervals have similar value of the break energy, between 0.9 and 1.4\\,keV.\nThe overall the {broken power-law}\\ fit to data results in the break energy of 1.1\\,keV.\nThis indicates that division into the soft and the hard intervals with a good approximation reflects synchrotron and inverse Compton components.\nWe also investigate the spectral variability in the context of flux variation. Hardness ratio - total count rate comparison, presented in Fig.~\\ref{flux_hr} indicates behaviour similar to the one observed in the case of 3C\\,66A. \nIt is also worth mentioning that in the case of this source we do not see clear harder-when-brighter trend or the opposite softer-when-brighter one. \nWhile the anticorrelation of the hardness ratio and the flux count rate in the case of S5\\,0716+714 was previously reported in the X-ray regime by e.g. \\cite{Foschini06, Ferrero06}.\nThe values of the spectral indices indicate significant spectral variability of the synchrotron component, which is not observed in the case of the inverse Compton part of the spectrum. \n\n\\paragraph*{W~Comae:}\nThe observed count flux rate (see the upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{lc_wcomea}) changes in the range of 0.1-0.7\\,counts/s. The figure shows also the  soft (0.3-2.0\\,keV) and the hard (2.0-10.0\\,keV) energy band light curve as well as the hardness ratio evolution. \nThe longterm variability of the blazar can be characterized with fractional variability amplitude resulting in $F_\\textit{var}=(94 \\pm 1) \\%$, $F_\\textit{var}=(69 \\pm 2) \\%$, $F_\\textit{var}=(56 \\pm 6) \\%$, and $F_\\textit{var}=(28 \\pm 9) \\%$  for the total, the soft, the hard and hardness ratio light curve respectively. These results show that the highest variability is observed in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV.\n\nAs in the case of previously discussed sources, separate intervals are distinguished to investigate spectral features in the different states. In the case of W\\,Comae two intervals are considered representing the low (the second interval) and the elevated (the first interval) flux level (see Fig.~\\ref{lc_wcomea}). \nData collected during both periods are fitted with the {broken power-law}\\ model with the Galactic absorption {N$_H$}\\ taken from the survey provided by \\cite{Willingale13}. \nThe spectral fit parameters are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fits}, while all corresponding plots are shown in Fig.\\ref{seds_breaks}. In both intervals the spectral shapes reveal a concave curvature. \nThe selected intervals are characterized with different values of the break energy: 4.1\\,keV and 1.2\\,keV for the first and the second interval, respectively. It is worth reminding here that the crossing point in the {broken power-law}\\ fit to all data is determined as 2.0\\,keV. Because of this fact the soft and the  hard energy bands used for the light curves do not indicate clearly the synchrotron and inverse Compton components.\nThe values of the spectral indices reveal larger spectral variability in the soft energy band.\nThe comparison of the hardness ratio and the total count rate, presented in Fig.~\\ref{flux_hr} exhibit similar behaviour as in the case of 3C\\,66A and S5\\,0716+714. \n\n\\paragraph*{4C\\,$+$21.35:}\nThe light curve presenting the longterm variability of the blazar (see the  upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{lc_4c2135}) shows smaller changes in the observed count rate than in the case of other blazars discussed here. The variability observed in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV can be described with fractional variability amplitude as high as $F_\\textit{var}=(39 \\pm 1) \\%$.\nThe soft and the  hard energy bands, presented in the middle panels of Fig.~\\ref{lc_4c2135}, are defined as: 0.3-1.2\\,keV and 1.2-10\\,keV.\nThe value of 1.2\\,keV is the break energy point found in the average spectrum of this blazar.\nTo check whether the fractional variability amplitude depends on the energy band considered, this quantity has been also calculated for the soft and the hard energy bands resulting in: $F_\\textit{var}=(56 \\pm 1) \\%$ and  $F_\\textit{var}=(31 \\pm 1) \\%$, respectively. The bottom panel in Fig.~\\ref{lc_4c2135}  show hardness ratio light curve, which is characterized by  $F_\\textit{var}=(23 \\pm 1) \\%$. \n\nThree intervals have been distinguished for detailed spectral studies.\nThe spectral analysis has been repeated for each of the interval. Since in the case  of set of all observations data are well described with {broken power-law}\\ model with the Galactic absorption, here also this model has been used. For this case {N$_H$}\\ value taken from \\cite{Willingale13} survey is used. Reduced $\\chi^2$ values show that this model works well also for shorter intervals. \nAll the spectral parameters of the {broken power-law}\\ fit and the corresponding plots are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fits} and shown in Fig.~\\ref{seds_breaks}.\nFor the intervals selected the {broken power-law}\\ fit results in the break energy of value 1.0-1.2\\,keV. We can then conclude that the soft and the hard energy bands with a good approximation correspond to the synchrotron and the inverse Compton spectral components, respectively.\nThe comparison of the hardness ratio and the total count rate, presented in Fig.~\\ref{flux_hr} shows complex behaviour, with individual substructures and indication for hysteresis effects visible within each.\n \n\n\\paragraph*{BL~Lacertae:}\nThe light curve of BL Lacertae (see upper panel of Fig.~\\ref{lc_bllac}) in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV shows significant variability exhibited in several outbursts. The longterm variability is characterized using fractional variability amplitude with the value of \n$F_\\textit{var}=(52 \\pm 1) \\%$. As in the previous cases, we also consider the soft and the hard energy bands defined as 0.3-1.1\\,keV and 1.1-10.0\\,keV, respectively, as well as the hardness ratio.\nThe variability in the soft and the hard energy ranges is then given by $F_\\textit{var}=(47 \\pm 1) \\%$ and $F_\\textit{var}=(58 \\pm 1) \\%$, respectively. The variability amplitude is more pronounced in the higher energies. For the comparison the hardness ratio variability is quantified by $F_\\textit{var}=(13 \\pm 1) \\%$.\n\nTo check if the crossing point, disentangling the synchrotron and the  inverse Compton components, is shifting for the  different flux states of the source, four intervals are distinguished (see the light curve in Fig.~\\ref{lc_bllac}).\nEach of the intervals represents different the X-ray behaviour of BL~Lacertae. Data in each interval are then fitted with the {broken power-law}\\ model with the Galactic absorption {N$_H$}\\ taken from the survey provided by \\cite{Willingale13}. The fit parameters are collected in Table~\\ref{table_fits} and the corresponding plots are shown in Fig.~\\ref{seds_breaks}. Let us here remind that the {broken power-law}\\ fit to all data results in the break energy of 1.1\\,keV. \nFor the shorter intervals the break energy is oscillating between 1.1-1.2\\,keV. \nA clear upturn of the spectrum, disentangling two spectral components is visible in the case of the three intervals discussed. \n\nFurthermore, there is no significant shift of the crossing point to the higher energies with the increasing flux, which is observed in the other blazars discussed.\nHence, for this blazar the soft and hard energy bands in a good approximation correspond to the synchrotron and the inverse Compton components.  The synchrotron component is then characterized by larger spectral variability comparing to the inverse Compton one.\nThe hardness ratio seem to be correlated with the total count rate (see Fig.~\\ref{flux_hr}), which is not surprising in the case of HBL type blazars, but it is not a common feature of the IBL ones.\n\n\\section{Summary and conclusions}\\label{discussion}\nIn this paper we study spectra of 29 TeV~$\\gamma$-ray emitting blazars including 22 HBL, 4 IBL type blazars, and 3 FSRQs observed with {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ in the energy range of 0.3-10\\,keV. \nThe only one LBL blazar detected in  TeV $\\gamma$-ray regime, (AP\\,Librae) is not part of  the sample presented here.\nSince only TeV blazars are included in the sample and HBL type objects are known to be the brightest in this regime, three groups of blazars included are not distributed uniformly. \n\nThe spectra studied are averaged, which means that they include observations in the low and the high states, for data collected since the mission start up to October 2014. We focus only on the PC mode observations, which implicates that the highest outbursts are not included in the averaged spectra. \nThis is the first spectral survey including 10\\,years of observations of TeV emitting blazars collected with {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}. \n\n\nWe conclude that the most of the spectra are well described using the curved {log-parabola}\\ model. Only in a few cases we get better characteristics with the {power-law}\\ model. These are 1ES\\,1101$-$232, Mrk\\,180, and PKS\\,2005$-$489. There are also a few cases of objects for which we got acceptable {power-law}\\ fit only if the free {N$_H$}\\ value is used. These are mainly cases for which free value of the Galactic absorption is much higher than the ones provided in the  discussed surveys. \n \n\nThe curved {log-parabola}\\ model has been used to describe the shape of radio-optical blazars spectra for the first time by \\cite{Landau86}.\nThe first X-ray studies involving the {log-parabola}\\ as the best model for spectral fits have been performed by \\cite{Giommi02} who found this model as the preferable one for 50$\\%$ of blazars studied. Also \\cite{Massaro04a, Massaro04b, Tramacere07, Massaro08} successfully used this model in their X-ray spectral studies. \n\nThe observed convex curvature in the X-ray spectra is likely to result from a single accelerated particle distribution\n \\citep[e.g.][]{Massaro04b}.\nThe concave curvature observed may be caused by the fact that the X-ray range is a place, where synchrotron and inverse Compton components meet  and the curvature is a consequence of the spectral upturn. In the latter case the X-ray observations enable simultaneous study  of the low and the high  energy ends of the particle distribution function. \n\nDifferent values of {N$_H$}\\ tested do not allow us to find one universal set. On the other hand we cannot conclude that any of mentioned {N$_H$}\\ surveys can be used in each case to obtain good fit. But we can then summarize that each case should be treated separately, often including wider view on spectral features also in different wavelengths, see an example of two blazars presented in Fig.~\\ref{xrt_bat}, where the {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ observations are combined with the {\\textit{Swift}/BAT}\\ ones.\nFurthermore, our studies has shown that the Galactic column density value influence the overall spectral fit. In general larger {N$_H$}\\ values result in softer spectral index, i.e.  larger value of $\\Gamma$ or $\\alpha$ parameter in the {power-law}\\ and the {log-parabola}\\ model, respectively.\nAlso in  most cases for the {log-parabola}\\ model fitted the curvature parameter is larger for smaller {N$_H$}\\ values. \nHence, we can summarize that the choice has significant influence on the X-ray spectral features. It is also worth  mentioning that {$\\chi_{red}^2$}\\ is not a good indicator, which could be used to distinguish the most accurate value of the Galactic column density. Let us here remind the example of  1ES\\,0033+595, for which very different values of {N$_H$}\\  result in the significantly different spectral fit parameters and very similar values of {$\\chi_{red}^2$}\\ (see Fig.~\\ref{seds_lp} and \\ref{seds_po} (in the online material), and Table~\\ref{table_fitpar_lp} and \\ref{table_fitpar_po} (in the online material) for plots and spectral fit parameters for the {log-parabola}\\ and the {power-law}\\ models). In the mentioned case too small value of {N$_H$}\\ e.g. the one taken from LAB survey result in the spectral shape with the artificial bump which cannot be easily explained.\nVery similar situation take place for the cases of blazars such like 1ES\\,0502+675, 1ES\\,0647+250 or 1ES\\,1959+650.\n\n\n\nThe {log-parabola}\\ model is described by the $\\alpha$ parameter, which corresponds to the spectral index and $\\beta$ one, which characterize the spectral curvature. We found the spectral indices $\\alpha$ in the range of  1.4-2.6.  \n\n\n\nThe performed spectral studies of 29 $\\gamma$-ray emitting blazars allow us to distinguish only 5 blazars for which the concave spectral shape indicates that in the X-ray regime synchrotron and inverse Compton components meet. \nSince the spectral upturn is expected in all blazar SEDs and we focused on the energy range of one magnitude,  we then conclude that the spectral upturns are distributed in the broad range of energies\nThe second part of the paper includes detailed  temporal and spectral studies  focused on 5 sources for which concave shape of the spectrum indicates that  the synchrotron and the inverse Compton components meet in the X-ray regime.\nThe mentioned sources are: 4C\\,$+$21.35, S5\\,0716+714, BL\\,Lacertae, 3C\\,66A, and W~Comae.\nFor each  of the objects  the preferable model to describe the spectral shape is  the {log-parabola}\\ with a concave curvature.  \nFor these five blazars with the upturn, we fit spectra with the {broken power-law}\\ model, which helps us to find the crossing point for the average spectrum, disentangling the synchrotron and the inverse Compton components.\nFor all sources the upturn point is clearly visible in the averaged spectrum for the dataset including all data analysed. \nBut for the case of shorter time intervals synchrotron and inverse Compton components are not always visible.\nFor example 3C\\,66A for A and B intervals two components are clearly visible, while for the case of the third distinguished interval, the spectral shape reveals only the synchrotron part of the spectrum.\nIt is also worth  underlining that the upward curvature was previously reported for S5\\,0716+714 \\citep{Cappi94,Giommi99,Tagliaferri03,Donato05,Ferrero06}, BL\\,Lacertae \\citep{Tanihata00,Ravasio02,Donato05}, 3C\\,66A \\citep{Donato05}, and W~Comae \\citep{Tagliaferri00, Donato05}, \nwhile this is the first case when the upturn between the synchrotron and the inverse Compton component is found for 4C\\,$+$21.35.\nUsing {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ observations of blazars we found five objects with the spectral upturn. Also, there are objects for which single {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ observations do not reveal this feature, but joint spectrum, that include {\\textit{Swift}/XRT}\\ and {\\textit{Swift}/BAT}\\ data show such an upturn. But since {\\textit{Swift}/BAT}\\ spectra are longterm-averaged it is difficult to quantify the number of such objects. As an example Fig.~\\ref{xrt_bat} show joint fits for PKS\\,0548-322 and PKS\\,2005-489.\n\nThe longterm variability of those five blazars has been characterized with fractional variability amplitude. This quantity is also calculated for the distinguished the  soft and the  hard energy bands as well as for the hardness ratio evolution. \nThe soft and the hard energy band corresponds to the synchrotron and the  inverse Compton components in the average spectral fit. \nFor 4C\\,$+$21.35, S5\\,0716+714, 3C\\,66A, and W~Comae the largest value of $F_\\textit{var}$ is obtained for the soft energy range, while the lowest variability is observed for the hardness ratio light curve. \nOnly for BL\\,Lacertae the largest value of $F_{var}$ is for the hard energy range. \n\nWe also investigate the spectral variability by dividing the light curves into shorter intervals and performing spectral analysis for smaller data sets. In this case only the {broken power-law}\\ model with the Galactic absorption value taken from LAB survey is tested. \nIn the case of S5\\,0716+714, 4C\\,$+$21.35 and BL\\,Lacertae the energy break value are consistent within errors with the value obtained for the average spectrum. Hence, we conclude that the distinguished soft and the hard energy bands corresponds to the  synchrotron and the inverse Compton components, respectively.\nIn the case of 3C\\,66A, and W~Comae the break energy values for the short intervals and the average spectrum are different, so the soft and the hard bands can not be unambiguously associated with the synchrotron and the inverse Compton components.\nFurthermore the comparison of the spectral indices for the {broken power-law}\\ fit for the shorter intervals revealed significant variability in the soft energy range, while in the hard one the variability is not noticed in the case of 3C\\,66A.\n\n\nWe also compared the hardness ratio, calculated as a ratio of count rates in the  hard and the  soft energy bands, with the total intensity. \nThis comparison revealed different behaviours of in  HR-total intensity diagrams.\nFor three of studied blazars, namely 3C\\,66A, W\\,Comae and S5\\,0716+714 for the soft spectrum (smaller values of HR) total intensity of the sources changes in the whole range of brightness.\nWhile when the source is faint, different values of HR can be observed. \nSuch a behaviour suggests that in the faint state of the source the influence of the  inverse Compton component is more significant.\nFor BL\\,Lacertae HR-total intensity diagram exhibit harder-when-brighter trend. \nSuch a behaviour is a common feature for HBL type blazars \\citep[e.g.][]{Pian98, Zhang2005, Zhang06b, Abramowski2012_2155}, while IBL and LBL ones often exhibits softer-when-brighter pattern \\citep[e.g.][]{Giommi99, Ravasio02, Ferrero06}. \nThe case of 4C\\,21.35 is the most complex one with individual substructures and an indication for hysteresis effects visible within each. Such a hysteresis trend visible in HR-flux diagram can be related to the  changes of the  acceleration and cooling time scales \\citep{Kirk98}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering{\\includegraphics[width=0.92\\textwidth]{graph/sed-multi-lp-new-objs-1.pdf}}\n\\caption{The X-ray spectral energy distributions of 29 selected blazars sorted by increasing flux density.
