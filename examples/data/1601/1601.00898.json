In this paper, we present kinetic modelling of scenarios with time-dependent plasma parameters; in particular, we investigate hot-tail runaway generation during a rapid drop in plasma temperature. With the goal of studying runaway-electron generation with a self-consistent electric-field evolution, we also discuss the implementation of a conservative collision operator and demonstrate its properties. An operator for avalanche runaway-electron generation, which takes the energy dependence of the scattering cross section and the runaway distribution into account, is investigated. We show that the simpler avalanche model of Rosenbluth \\& Putvinskii \\cite{RosPut} can give very inaccurate results for the avalanche growth rate (either lower or higher) for many parameters, especially when the average runaway energy is modest, such as during the initial phase of the avalanche multiplication. The developments presented pave the way for an improved modelling of runaway-electron dynamics during disruptions or other dynamic events.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nRunaway electrons, a phenomenon made possible by the decrease of the collisional friction with particle energy \\cite{Dreicer}, are common in plasmas in the presence of strong external electric fields or changing currents. The tightly focused beam of highly relativistic particles can be a serious threat to the first wall of a fusion reactor, due to the possibility of localized melting or halo current generation \\cite{ITER_DMS}. In the quest for avoidance or mitigation of the harmful effects of runaway-electron losses, a greater understanding of the runaway-electron phenomenon is required \\cite{Boozer}. Improved knowledge of runaway-electron formation mechanisms, dynamics and characteristics will benefit the fusion community and contribute to a stable and reliable operation of reactor-scale tokamaks.\n\nKinetic simulation is the most accurate and useful method for investigating runaway-electron dynamics, and we recently developed a new tool called {\\textsc{CODE}}{} (COllisional Distribution of Electrons \\cite{CODE}) for fast and detailed study of these processes. {\\textsc{CODE}}{} solves the spatially homogeneous kinetic equation for electrons in 2-D momentum space, including electric-field acceleration, collisions, avalanche runaway generation and synchrotron-radiation-reaction losses \\cite{CODE,PRL,Bump_ana}. In {\\textsc{CODE}}{}, momentum space is discretized using finite differences in momentum and a Legendre-mode decomposition in pitch-angle cosine. Often, the time evolution of the distribution is the desired output, but a (quasi-)steady-state solution can also be efficiently obtained through the inversion of a single sparse system (in the absence of an avalanche source). CODE has been used to study the spectrum of the synchrotron emission emitted by runaways \\cite{CODE}, the corresponding influence of the emission on the distribution function \\cite{PRL,Bump_ana,Bump_num}, and the factors influencing the critical electric field for runaway-electron generation \\cite{PRL,Paz-Soldan}. \n\nIn this paper we describe improvements to {\\textsc{CODE}}{} which enable us to investigate the effect of hot-tail runaway generation on the distribution (Section~\\ref{sec:td}). This process can be the dominant mechanism in rapidly cooling plasmas. We also discuss the implementation of a full linearized collision operator, and demonstrate its conservation properties (Section \\ref{sec:coll_op}). The use of this operator is necessary in cases where the correct plasma conductivity is required, and our implementation indeed reproduces the Spitzer conductivity \\cite{SpitzerHarm} for weak electric fields. In addition, an improved model for the large-angle (knock-on) Coulomb collisions leading to avalanche multiplication of the runaway population \\cite{Chiu}, is described in Section \\ref{sec:knock-on}. This model takes the energy dependence of the runaway distribution into account, and uses the complete energy-dependent M\\o ller scattering cross section \\cite{Moller}. We find that its use can in some cases lead to significant modifications to the avalanche growth rate, compared to a more simple model \\cite{RosPut}. \n\nThe improvements described in this work enable the detailed study of runaway processes in dynamic situations such as disruptions, and the conservative collision operator makes self-consistent calculations of the runaway population and current evolution in such scenarios feasible \\cite{PappEPS15}.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Time-dependent plasma parameters}\n\\label{sec:td}\n\nTo be able to investigate the behavior of the electron population in dynamic scenarios such as disruptions or sawtooth crashes, it is necessary to follow the distribution function as the plasma parameters change. To this end, {\\textsc{CODE}}{} has been modified to handle time-dependent background-plasma parameters. Since the kinetic equation is treated in linearized form, the actual temperature and density of the distribution are determined by the background Maxwellian used in the formulation of the collision operator. This allows for a scheme where the kinetic equation is normalized to a \\emph{reference} temperature ${\\ensuremath{\\tilde{{T}}}}$ and number density ${\\ensuremath{\\tilde{{n}}}}$, so that the discretized equation can be expressed on a fixed \\emph{reference grid} in momentum space. (Throughout this paper, we will use a tilde to denote a reference quantity.) By changing the properties of the Maxwellian equilibrium around which the collision operator is linearized, plasma-parameter evolution can be modelled on the reference grid without the need for repeated interpolation of the distribution function to new grids. \n\nAnalogously to {Ref.~\\cite{{CODE}}}, the kinetic equation in 2D momentum space for the electron distribution function $f$ experiencing an electric field $E$ (parallel to the magnetic field) and collisions, can be expressed as\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\t{\\ensuremath{\\frac{\\partial {F}}{\\partial {{\\ensuremath{\\hat{t}}}}}}} + \n\t{\\ensuremath{\\hat{E}}}  \\left(  \\xi{\\ensuremath{\\frac{\\partial {F}}{\\partial {{y}}}}} + \\frac{1-\\xi^{2}}{{y}}{\\ensuremath{\\frac{\\partial {F}}{\\partial {\\xi}}}}  \\right)\n\t=\\hat{C}\\left\\{ F\\right\\} +\\hat{S}_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize }}}\\left\\{ F\\right\\}.\n\\label{eq:kinetic}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\frac{\\partial{F}}{\\partial{{\\hat{t}}}}}+{\\hat{E}}\\left(\\xi{\\frac{\\partial{F}%&#10;}{\\partial{{y}}}}+\\frac{1-\\xi^{2}}{{y}}{\\frac{\\partial{F}}{\\partial{\\xi}}}%&#10;\\right)=\\hat{C}\\left\\{F\\right\\}+\\hat{S}_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize}}}\\left\\{F\\right\\}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03be</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><msup><mi>\u03be</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mi>y</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>\u03be</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>}</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow/></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mi>F</mi><mo>}</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00898.tex", "nexttext": "\nHere (and throughout the rest of this paper), a bar denotes a quantity normalized to its reference value (i.e, ${{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{v}}}}_e}=v_e/{{\\ensuremath{\\tilde{{v}}}}_e}$), ${x}={y}/\\gamma=v/{{\\ensuremath{\\tilde{{v}}}}_e}$ is the normalized speed, $c_C = 3\\sqrt{\\pi}{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{\\nu}}}}_{ee}/4$, $c_\\xi = {Z_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize eff}}}+\\Phi-\\Psi+{{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{v}}}}_e}^2{\\delta}^4{x}^2/2$, ${Z_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize eff}}}$ is the effective ion charge, $\\Phi = \\Phi({x}/{{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{v}}}}_e})$ and $\\Psi \\!=\\! \\Psi({x}/{{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{v}}}}_e})\\!=\\!{{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{v}}}}_e}^2[\\Phi-{{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{v}}}}_e}^{-1}{x}\\mbox{d}\\Phi/\\mbox{d}({x}/{{\\ensuremath{\\bar{{v}}}}_e})]/2{x}^2$ are the error and Chandrasekhar functions, respectively, and ${\\delta}\\!=\\!{{\\ensuremath{\\tilde{{v}}}}_e}/c$ (with $c$ the speed of light) is assumed to be a small parameter (i.e the thermal population is assumed to be non-relativistic). \n\nChanges to the plasma temperature manifest as shifts in the relative magnitude of the various terms in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:C}})} (through ${\\delta}$ and the quantities with a bar), as well as a change in the overall magnitude of the operator, whereas changes in density only have the latter effect.

The initially slightly more energetic electrons, although part of the original bulk population, thermalize less efficiently.

C^l\\{f\\} \\!=\\! {C^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {tp}}}}}  \\!+\\! {C^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {fp}}}}}$. The so-called \\emph{test-particle term}, ${C^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {tp}}}}} = {C^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {nl}}}}}\\{f_1,f_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {M}}}}\\}$, describes the perturbation colliding with the bulk of the plasma, whereas the \\emph{field-particle term}, ${C^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {fp}}}}}={C^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {nl}}}}}\\{f_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {M}}}},f_1\\}$, describes the reaction of the bulk to the perturbation. Here ${C^{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {nl}}}}}$ is the non-linear Fokker-Planck-Landau operator, $f_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {M}}}}$ denotes a Maxwellian, and $f_1\\!=\\!f\\!-\\!f_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {M}}}}$ the perturbation to it ($f_1\\! \\ll\\! f_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {M}}}}$). Collisions described by $C\\{f_1,f_1\\}$ are neglected since they are second order in $f_1$. The full linearized operator $C^l$ conserves particles, momentum and energy. Since it is proportional to a factor $\\exp(-y^2)$, the field-particle term mainly affects the bulk of the plasma, and is therefore commonly neglected when studying runaway-electron kinetics. The test-particle term in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:C}})} only ensures the conservation of particles, however, not momentum or energy.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, it is necessary to use a fully conservative treatment also for the runaway problem, in particular when considering processes where the conductivity of the plasma is important. In the study of runaway dynamics during a tokamak disruption using a self-consistent treatment of the electrical field, accurate plasma current evolution is essential, and the full linearized collision operator must be used. A non-linear collision operator valid for arbitrary particle (and bulk) energy has been formulated \\cite{BelBud,BraamsKarney}. The collision operator originally implemented in {\\textsc{CODE}}{} is the result of an asymptotic matching between the highly relativistic limit of the test-particle term of the linearized version of that operator, with the usual non-relativistic test-particle operator \\cite{Papp2011}, and is given in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:C}). The relativistic field-particle term is significantly more complicated, however, and its use would be computationally more expensive. Here we instead implemented the non-relativistic field-particle term, as formulated in Refs.~\\cite{CattoTsang,LiErnst}. As will be shown, this operator (together with the non-relativistic limit of Eq.~\\ref{eq:C}) accurately reproduces the Spitzer conductivity for sufficiently weak electric fields and temperatures where the bulk is non-relativistic.

Note that the amount of numerical noise is significantly reduced for the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})}. In order to avoid double-counting the small-angle collisions described by the Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator $C$, the knock-on source must be cut off at some value of momentum sufficiently far from the thermal bulk. As can be seen from the figure, however, the magnitude of both sources increases with decreasing momenta, and the avalanche growth rate is therefore sensitive to the specific choice of momentum cut-off. Since our particular interest is the generation of runaway electrons, we choose to place the cut-off at $y\\!=\\!y_c$, so that the sources are non-vanishing only in the runaway region \\cite{CODE,Harvey}. Secondary particles deposited just below the threshold -- although not technically runaways -- could eventually diffuse into the runaway region, thereby potentially increasing the Dreicer growth rate. In Ref.~\\cite{Nilsson}, such effects were however shown to be negligible for the operator in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:RP}})}, indicating that the vast majority of particles deposited at $y\\! < \\! y_c$ are slowed down rather than accelerated (as expected). This reduces the sensitivity of the avalanche growth rate to the choice of momentum cut-off (as long as $y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {cut-off}}}}\\!\\leq\\!y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {c}}}}$), and reaffirms our choice $y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {cut-off}}}}\\!=\\!y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {c}}}}$.  \n\n\n\n {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:sources}}}c shows the source magnitudes integrated over pitch-angle, and as expected, the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})} extends only up to $y \\simeq y_{\\max}/2$, whereas the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:RP}})} is non-vanishing also for larger momenta. The amount of secondary runaways generated by the two sources agree well at low energies, but less so further away from the bulk. In this particular case, the total source magnitude $\\int\\! \\hat{S}\\, y^2\\mbox{d}y\\mbox{d}\\xi$ agrees to within 25\\%, as most of the secondaries are created close to the boundary of the runaway region. \n\n\\subsection{Avalanche growth rates for the different operators}\nIn general, the avalanche growth rate produced by the two sources can differ substantially. We will illustrate this point by considering the M\\o ller cross section in more detail. We choose to quantify the source magnitude for an arbitrary distribution by computing the cross section, integrated over the energy of the outgoing (secondary) particle and normalized to $r_0^2$, with $r_0$ the classical electron radius. In other words, we look at the total normalized cross section for an incoming particle with ${\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}$ to participate in a knock-on collision resulting in avalanche \\cite{Aleynikov}: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\tK_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {Ch}}}}({\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}) &= \\int_{{\\gamma}_c}^{({\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-1)/2+1} &\\Sigma({\\gamma},{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}})\\mbox{d}{\\gamma} \\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t&= ({\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}^2-1)^{-1}\n\t\t\t\t&\\left[\n\t\t\t\t\t\\frac{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}^2}{{\\gamma}_c-1} + \\frac{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}^2}{{\\gamma}_c-{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}} \\right. \\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t\t\t&&\\ + \\left. \\frac{2{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-1}{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-1}\\ln\\left( \\frac{{\\gamma}_c-1}{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-{\\gamma}_c} \\right)\n\t\t\t\t\t+ \\frac{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}+1}{2} - {\\gamma}_c\n\t\t\t\t\\right],\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere ${\\gamma}_c = \\sqrt{(E/E_c)/(E/E_c-1)}$ corresponds to the critical momentum for runaway generation and the upper integration boundary stems from the condition leading to $\\xi_{\\max}$.\nThis expression is relevant to the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})}, which uses the complete cross section (\\ref{eq:Moller}), whereas for the more simple source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:RP}})}, only the leading order term in ${\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}$ in the scattering cross section is taken into account.

As expected, the two expressions agree very well at high primary momenta. At somewhat lower momenta, of the order ${\\gamma}\\!\\approx\\! p\\! {\\apprle}\\! 5$, two distinct regions are discernible. For $E/E_c\\! {\\apprle}\\! 10$ (the orange region), the simplified cross section is larger than the full expression, and the Rosenbluth-Putvinski operator (\\ref{eq:RP}) is likely to overestimate the avalanche generation. For $E/E_c\\! {\\apprge}\\! 10$, the opposite is true, and the operator in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})} has a significantly larger cross section for $E/E_c\\! {\\apprge}\\! 30$ (the blue region). The more accurate operator (\\ref{eq:Ch}) should thus be expected to produce more runaways when the runaway population is at predominantly low energies, and $E/E_c$ is large. For both of these conditions to be fulfilled simultaneously (and at the same time avoid a slide-away scenario), the temperature must be low so that $E/E_D\\ll 1$ even for large $E/E_c$. The effect is also likely to be most apparent at relatively early times, before the runaway tail has extended to multi-MeV energies. \n\nCODE simulations support the above conclusions and show excellent qualitative agreement, as shown in {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}b. The figure shows the ratio of final avalanche growth rates $(\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {Ch}}}}-\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {D}}}})/(\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {RP}}}}-\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {D}}}})$, with $\\Gamma_i \\!=\\! n_r^{-1}({\\mbox{d}} n_r/{\\mbox{d}}{\\ensuremath{\\hat{t}}})$ the growth rate obtained in a CODE run using source $i$ (here the subscript D denotes pure Dreicer generation). Each marker in the figure is thus computed from three separate CODE runs. As a proxy for $p_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}$, the average runaway momentum $p_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {r,av}}}}$ in the final time step $t_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {f}}}}$ of the simulation without a source was used. The simulations were run for $t_{\\max}\\!=\\!5000$ collision times, and $t_f$ was set to either $t_{\\max}$, the first time step for which $n_r\\!>\\!5\\%$, or the the first time step in which the growth rate started to become affected by the proximity of the runaway tail to the end of the simulation grid, whichever occurred first. The parameters of the scan where chosen to focus on the most interesting region of {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}a -- by performing longer simulations on larger momentum grids, the upper part of the figure could also be studied. Exact agreement between Figs. \\ref{fig:K_ratio}a and b can not be expected, since the source, in addition to the cross section, depends on the details of the runaway distribution. Figure \\ref{fig:K_ratio}a should thus be viewed as a simplified analytical estimate for {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}b. The different regions identified in {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}a are still apparent in {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}b, however they are somewhat shifted in parameter space. In particular, the region where the Rosenbluth-Putvinski operator produces a higher growth rate is larger, whereas the opposite region -- where the operator in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})} dominates -- is smaller, or at least shifted to higher values of $E/E_c$.  \n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth, trim={0cm 0cm 0.9cm 0.2cm},clip]{fig7}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Ratio of avalanche growth rates ($[\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {Ch}}}}\\!-\\!\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {D}}}}]/[\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {RP}}}}\\!-\\!\\Gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {D}}}}]$) in CODE simulations, as a function of temperature. The same parameters as in {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}} were used.}\n\\label{fig:Growth_vs_temp}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:Growth_vs_temp} shows all the data points in {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}b, as a function of temperature. The figure confirms that the region where the more accurate operator produces a significantly higher growth rate is only accessible at temperatures $T < 100\\,$eV (in the domain of validity of a linearized treatment). As is evident in the figure, however, regions where the Rosenbluth-Putvinski operator significantly overestimates the avalanche growth rate (points below 1 on the vertical axis) are present at all temperatures. The operator in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})} is thus of general interest. \n\nSince the electric field spike responsible for the acceleration of runaways during a tokamak disruption is induced by the temperature drop, and therefore occurs slightly later than the drop itself, the temperature is low during the majority of the acceleration process. For significant runaway acceleration, $E/E_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {c}}}}\\! \\gg\\! 1$ is therefore required, and during the initial part of the acceleration process, parameters are likely those corresponding to the blue region of {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}a, where the improved avalanche source produces a significantly higher growth rate than the Rosenbluth-Putvinski operator. Post-thermal-quench temperatures in ITER are expected be as low as 10 eV and peak electric fields in disruptions can reach 80 V/m or more \\cite{Papp}. Towards the end of the thermal quench, the normalized electric field is then $E/E_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {c}}}}\\! \\approx\\! 1300$ (with $E\\!=\\!80\\,$V/m, $T\\!=\\!50\\,$eV and $n\\!=\\!1{\\!\\cdot\\! 10^{{20}}}\\,$m$^{-3}$). A typical ITER disruption would thus (at least initially) be firmly in the blue region of {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}b, and the avalanche growth should be significantly higher than what the Rosenbluth-Putvinski source predicts. As the temperature is low, the runaways will also spend a comparatively long time at low momenta ($p\\! \\ll\\! 1$), where the disagreement between the operators is most pronounced. Since the electric field changes rapidly, however, the runaways may experience parameters corresponding to both the orange and blue regions in {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:K_ratio}}}b, and once the runaways reach high energies, the difference between the operators decreases. Further work is therefore needed to assess the overall impact on the avalanche growth of using the improved operator (\\ref{eq:Ch}), although it is clear that its use is essential for accurate analysis.\n\n \n\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\nRunaway electrons are intimately linked to dynamic scenarios, as they predominantly occur during disruptions and sawtooth events in tokamaks. An accurate description of their dynamics in such scenarios requires kinetic modelling of rapidly changing plasma conditions, and mechanisms such as hot-tail runaway generation add to the already interesting set of phenomena of importance to the evolution of the runaway population. \n\nIn this paper we have described the modelling of several such processes, using the numerical tool {\\textsc{CODE}}{} to calculate the momentum space distribution of runaway electrons. In particular, we have investigated rapid-cooling scenarios where hot-tail runaway-electron generation is dominant. Good agreement with previous theoretical work was observed, but {\\textsc{CODE}}{} simulations also allow for flexible study of a variety of parameter regimes not readily accessible in analytical treatments, and involving other processes such as avalanche generation or synchrotron radiation. \n\nFurthermore, the full linearized non-relativistic Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator was discussed, and its implementation described. The operator was found to reproduce the expected Spitzer conductivity in the relevant parameter regime and showed excellent conservation properties. The use of such an operator is essential for the correct current evolution in self-consistent modelling, and in particular when studying the interplay between current and electric field evolution and runaway-electron generation during a disruption. \n\nThe process of avalanche multiplication of the runaway population via close Coulomb collisions was also considered, and an improved operator, relaxing some of the approximations of the commonly used Rosenbluth-Putvinski operator, was discussed. It was found that the avalanche growth rate can be significantly affected -- increased for low temperatures and high $E/E_c$ and decreased for low $E/E_c$ -- by the use of the new operator. The change to the growth rate can be especially large during the early stages of the runaway acceleration process, thus potentially affecting the likelihood of a given runaway seed transforming into a serious runaway beam, and use of the improved operator is of particular relevance in disruption scenarios. \n\nThe work presented in this paper paves the way for a better understanding of runaway electron dynamics in rapidly changing scenarios, for instance during tokamak disruptions. It enables more accurate assessment of the risks posed by runaway electrons in situations of experimental interest, particularly in view of future tokamaks such as ITER.\n\n\n\n\\ack\nThe authors are grateful to I.

(This relation is analogous to the parabola $\\xi_2$ in the case of the operator in Eq.~\\ref{eq:RP}.)

Curves corresponding to the ellipse $\\xi_2$, as well as the limits $\\xi_{\\min}$ and $\\xi_{\\max}$ are also included. Note that the amount of numerical noise is significantly reduced for the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})}. In order to avoid double-counting the small-angle collisions described by the Fokker-Planck-Landau collision operator $C$, the knock-on source must be cut off at some value of momentum sufficiently far from the thermal bulk. As can be seen from the figure, however, the magnitude of both sources increases with decreasing momenta, and the avalanche growth rate is therefore sensitive to the specific choice of momentum cut-off. Since our particular interest is the generation of runaway electrons, we choose to place the cut-off at $y\\!=\\!y_c$, so that the sources are non-vanishing only in the runaway region \\cite{CODE,Harvey}. Secondary particles deposited just below the threshold -- although not technically runaways -- could eventually diffuse into the runaway region, thereby potentially increasing the Dreicer growth rate. In Ref.~\\cite{Nilsson}, such effects were however shown to be negligible for the operator in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:RP}})}, indicating that the vast majority of particles deposited at $y\\! < \\! y_c$ are slowed down rather than accelerated (as expected). This reduces the sensitivity of the avalanche growth rate to the choice of momentum cut-off (as long as $y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {cut-off}}}}\\!\\leq\\!y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {c}}}}$), and reaffirms our choice $y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {cut-off}}}}\\!=\\!y_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {c}}}}$.  \n\n\n\n {Fig.~\\ref{{fig:sources}}}c shows the source magnitudes integrated over pitch-angle, and as expected, the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})} extends only up to $y \\simeq y_{\\max}/2$, whereas the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:RP}})} is non-vanishing also for larger momenta. The amount of secondary runaways generated by the two sources agree well at low energies, but less so further away from the bulk. In this particular case, the total source magnitude $\\int\\! \\hat{S}\\, y^2\\mbox{d}y\\mbox{d}\\xi$ agrees to within 25\\%, as most of the secondaries are created close to the boundary of the runaway region. \n\n\\subsection{Avalanche growth rates for the different operators}\nIn general, the avalanche growth rate produced by the two sources can differ substantially. We will illustrate this point by considering the M\\o ller cross section in more detail. We choose to quantify the source magnitude for an arbitrary distribution by computing the cross section, integrated over the energy of the outgoing (secondary) particle and normalized to $r_0^2$, with $r_0$ the classical electron radius. In other words, we look at the total normalized cross section for an incoming particle with ${\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}$ to participate in a knock-on collision resulting in avalanche \\cite{Aleynikov}: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\tK_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {Ch}}}}({\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}) &= \\int_{{\\gamma}_c}^{({\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-1)/2+1} &\\Sigma({\\gamma},{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}})\\mbox{d}{\\gamma} \\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t&= ({\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}^2-1)^{-1}\n\t\t\t\t&\\left[\n\t\t\t\t\t\\frac{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}^2}{{\\gamma}_c-1} + \\frac{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}^2}{{\\gamma}_c-{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}} \\right. \\nonumber\\\\\n\t\t\t\t\t&&\\ + \\left. \\frac{2{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-1}{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-1}\\ln\\left( \\frac{{\\gamma}_c-1}{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}-{\\gamma}_c} \\right)\n\t\t\t\t\t+ \\frac{{\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}+1}{2} - {\\gamma}_c\n\t\t\t\t\\right],\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere ${\\gamma}_c = \\sqrt{(E/E_c)/(E/E_c-1)}$ corresponds to the critical momentum for runaway generation and the upper integration boundary stems from the condition leading to $\\xi_{\\max}$.\nThis expression is relevant to the source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:Ch}})}, which uses the complete cross section (\\ref{eq:Moller}), whereas for the more simple source in {Eq.~(\\ref{{eq:RP}})}, only the leading order term in ${\\gamma_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {in}}}}}$ in the scattering cross section is taken into account. This corresponds to taking the high-energy limit of the above equation, so that\n\n", "index": 29, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\tK_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize {RP}}}} = \\frac{1}{{\\gamma}_c -1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E15.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"K_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize{RP}}}}=\\frac{1}{{\\gamma}_{c}-1}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mtext>RP</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
