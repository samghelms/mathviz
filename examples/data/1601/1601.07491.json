This question\nhas raised the research field of molecular electronics, see \\cite{Cuevas2010} and references therein\nfor an overview. One approach is based on carbon nanotubes, which for certain geometric parameters\n(i.e. tube diameter or number of windings) show a band gap and hence, can be used as transistors\n\\cite{Tans1998, Javey2003, Martel1998, Charlier2007}. A recent milestone has been the realization of\na carbon nanotube computer \\cite{Shulaker2013}. However, a drawback of this approach is that after\nthe grows of the nanotubes the metallic carbon nanotubes have to be separated from the\nsemi-conducting ones. An alternative approach could be to use individual polyacetylene chains, see a\nsketch in {figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}}~(a,b), which are predicted to have a band gap \\cite{Su1979, Heeger1988,\n  Heeger2001, Schnurpfeil2007, Nozaki2008, Nozaki2010}. The development and the discovery of these\nconducting polymers has been awarded with a Nobel prize in 2000. However, most of the experimental\nwork has been done with thin films of polyacetylene chains \\cite{Shirakawa1995,\n  Shirakawa2001}. Transport experiments with \\textit{individual} polyacetylene chains have, to the\nbest of our knowledge, not been performed yet. However, new developments in microwave experiments\nallow to emulate experimentally a tight-binding model, which has proven successful in studies of\ngraphene \\cite{Bellec2013, Bellec2013b, Stegmann2016}. These microwave experiments, which are\nperformed here for the first time on molecular structures, can measure the transport of microwaves\nthrough one or two dimensional tight-binding systems. The microwave transmission corresponds to the\nballistic single electron transport in mesoscopic physics or in molecules. Electron-electron\ninteraction, which is present to some extend in real molecules cannot be emulated by the microwave\nexperiment. The setup, which we use to emulate both the \\textit{cis}- (armchair) and\n\\textit{trans}-(zigzag) geometry of polyacetylenes of various lengths, is shown in {figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}}~(c,d).\n\nThe studied chains consist of $N_d$ dimers, which we here define via the double bonds, with $N_c$\nadditional edge atoms at the chain ends, which do not belong to dimers. The chains have altogether\n$N=2N_d+N_c$ atoms. For example, a cis-chain consisting of $N_d=11$ dimers with $N_c=2$ additional\nedge atoms at both chain ends is shown in {figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}}~(a). A trans-chain of $N_d= 9$ dimers with a\nsingle edge atom on the left end can be seen in {figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}}~(b). In this paper we explore the transport\nin polyacetylene like systems. In long chains a transport gap is observed, which is expected due to\nthe dimerization of the chain. We also discuss the effect of additional edge atoms, which is\nimportant in short chains.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n  \\centering\n  \\raisebox{0cm}{(a)}\\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth,angle=180]{fig1a}\\[2mm]\n  \\raisebox{0cm}{(b)}\\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth,angle=180]{fig1b}\\[3mm]\n  \\raisebox{1.1cm}{(c)}\\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{fig1c}\\[4mm]\n  \\raisebox{1.1cm}{(d)}\\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{fig1d}\n  \\caption{Structure of polyacetylene chains in \\textit{cis}-geometry (a) with $N_d=11$ dimers and\n    $N_c=2$ additional edge atoms, which are not part of the dimers, and in \\textit{trans}-geometry\n    (b) with $N_d=9$ dimers and a single edge atom ($N_c=1$) at the left chain end.

The larger gray spheres\n    correspond to the carbon atoms and the smaller white spheres to the hydrogen atoms, which\n    saturate the dangling bonds of the carbon atoms.}\n  \\label{fig:2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt first, we have calculated the optimal structure of the molecule by means of density functional\ntheory (DFT). Polyacetylenes consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms, which saturate the dangling bonds\nof the carbon atoms (see {figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}} and {figure~\\ref{fig:{2}}}). Due to this the contribution of the hydrogen to the\nconductance can be neglected and will not be taken into account in the tight-binding model or the\nmicrowave experiment.  We have used the GAUSSIAN 09 program \\cite{Frisch2009} with the hybrid\nfunctional B3LYP \\cite{Becke1988}. To perform calculations of periodic chains we have selected the\n6-311g(d) \\cite{Ditchfield1971} basis set, which uses linear combinations of Gaussian functions for\nthe orbitals. Additionally, we have added d-functions to the carbon atoms to improve the basis\nset. In both cases, the dimerization of the chain gives the most stable structure.  For the\ncis-chain, the horizontal bonds have a length of $1.37 {\\textup{\\AA}}$ while the diagonal bonds have a\nlength of $1.43 {\\textup{\\AA}}$ with an angle of $126.7$ degree, see {figure~\\ref{fig:{2}}} (upper). For the\ntrans-chain, the bond lengths are $1.37 {\\textup{\\AA}}$ and $1.43 {\\textup{\\AA}}$ with an angle of $127$\ndegree, see {figure~\\ref{fig:{2}}} (lower). Our findings agree with other ab initio studies of these molecules\n\\cite{Teramae1986, Rodriguez1995}. This dimerization, which is also known as Peierls distortion\n\\cite{Peierls1955}, is indicated in {figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}} and {figure~\\ref{fig:{2}}} by alternating single and double bonds\nbetween the carbon atoms.\n\nUsing the techniques, developed to investigate the band structure of graphene \\cite{Bellec2013,\n  Bellec2013b} and to emulate relativistic systems \\cite{Franco2013, Sadurni2013}, we have performed\nan analogous experiment with microwave resonators to study the transport properties of these\nchains. A set of identical dielectric cylindrical disks ($5\\un{mm}$ height, $4\\un{mm}$ radius, and a\nrefractive index of about 6) is placed between two metallic plates. The nearest neighbor distance of\nthe disks is typically around $12\\un{mm}$. Close to the chain ends, see the blue shaded disks in\n{figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}}, antennas are placed through which microwaves (transverse electrical (TE-)modes) can be\ninjected and detected. The individual disks have an isolated resonance at $6.65\\un{GHz}$. We\nrestrict our investigation to frequencies around this value, where each disk contributes only one\nresonance. The electromagnetic field for this TE mode is mostly confined within the disks and\nspreads evanescently outside. Photos of the experimental setup (without the second metallic plate on\ntop) are shown in {figure~\\ref{fig:{1}}} (c,d), and a detailed description can be found in \\cite{Bellec2013b}.\n\nTheoretically, we model the polyacetylene chains by the tight-binding Hamiltonian\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eq:1}\n  H= \\sum_{i,j\\leq \\text{2nn}} t_{ij}\\ensuremath{\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle}\\ensuremath{\\left\\langle{j}\\right|}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H=\\sum_{i,j\\leq\\text{2nn}}t_{ij}\\left|{i}\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle{j}\\right|\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mtext>2nn</mtext></mrow></munder><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo fence=\"true\">|</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\u27e8</mo><mi>j</mi><mo fence=\"true\">|</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07491.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $d_{ij}$ is the distance between disk $i$ and disk $j$, leading to a good agreement between\nthe microwave experiments and the tight-binding model.

The band gap exists in the cis- as well as in the trans-chains but\nit is more pronounced in the former configuration.

The Green's function calculations (red dashed\ncurves) agree qualitatively with the experimental data (blue solid curves), in particular for short\nchains.\n\nThe short chains still show individual resonance peaks, which are located approximately at the\neigenenergies of the tight-binding Hamiltonian {(\\ref{eq:{1}})}. When the chain length is increased, these\nresonances are less pronounced and two conduction bands arrise, which are separated by a band gap\naround the frequency $\\omega=0$. The band gap exists in the cis- as well as in the trans-chains but\nit is more pronounced in the former configuration. This can simply attributed to the fact that the\nnumber of atoms and hence the chain length is much larger in the cis- than in the\ntrans-chains. Numerical calculations confirm that the band gap becomes more pronounced also in the\ntrans-configuration when the chain length is increased.\n\nAdditionally, {figure~\\ref{fig:{4}}} shows the measured transmission through dimerized chains (blue-solid curves)\nand homogenous chains (red-dashed curves), where the bond lengths are all equal. The homogenous\nchain does not show a band-gap but conduction band ranging from $-70 \\un{MHz}$ to $90\\un{MHz}$ and\nhence, confirms that the opening of the band gap is due to the dimerization of the chain. The\nopening of the band gap due to the dimerization can be understood by considering an infinitely long\nchain with first nearest neighbor interaction only.

Note that the above equations are also valid for the homogenous chain ($t=t'$),\nwhere the band gap $2 \\Delta=0$ disappears.\n\n{Figure~\\ref{fig:{5}}} shows the calculated transmission through the short chains sketched in the inset. When the\nchain consists only of dimers without any additional edge atom (i.e. $N_c=0$) also in short chains a\nband gap or at least a broad transmission minimum can be observed (black-dotted curves). When an\nadditional edge atom is attached to one of the chain ends $N_c=1$, a distinct resonance peak is\ninduced in the center of the band gap around ${\\omega}=0$ (red-dashed curves). This resonance peak\nbelongs to an exponentially decreasing edge state which is localized at the chain end. Due to its\nlocalization this edge state is non-conductive in long chains and the corresponding resonance peak\ndisappears. When edge atoms are attached to both chain ends, two peaks are observed in the\ntransmission (blue-solid curves). These peaks belong to two states which are localized symmetrically\nor anti-symmetrically at both ends.  With increasing chain length the splitting of these peaks and\ntheir height decrease, until they finally do not contribute to the transmission any more. The\nadditional resonance peaks due to edge atoms can be seen clearly in {figure~\\ref{fig:{3}}} (first two rows). Our\nnumerical calculations show that the same effects appear also in pure dimer chains (shown at the\nbottom of the inset of {figure~\\ref{fig:{5}}}) if the contacts (or antennas) are not coupled to the blue shaded\natoms but moved one atom inside the chain. Note that the observed resonance peaks are not an\neven-odd parity effect of the chain length, which can be observed also in molecular chains\n\\cite{Kim2002}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb]\n  \\centering\n  \\mbox{\\includegraphics[scale=0.52]{fig5a}  \\hspace*{-2mm} \\includegraphics[scale=0.52]{fig5b}}\n  \\caption{Calculated transmission through the short chains sketched in the inset.

The experiments have been accompanied with tight-binding transport calculations using the\nNEGF method. Both, our experiments and calculations confirm that dimerization produces a band gap in\nthese chains. If the chains are sufficiently long, a band gap appears for cis- and trans-chains for\nall possible configurations of edge atoms and contact positions. This has been seen experimentally\nfor a single non-dimerized edge and has been confirmed numerically for other edge and contact\nconfigurations. Thus, returning to the motivation given at the beginning of this article, long\npolyacetylene chains might indeed replace carbon nanotubes in molecular transistors. Moreover, we\nhave also shown that short dimer chains have a pronounced transmission minimum, if no additional\nedge atoms are attached and the contacts are at the chain ends. Thus, at the expense of having to\nknow precisely the geometry of the molecule and the way how it is coupled to the contacts, it may\nwell be possible to use rather short chains for novel molecular transistors. While this is probably\nthe first microwave emulation of a molecule that is not largely made up of benzene rings, the actual\nscope for such microwave emulations is very wide. A first option would be to study local defects,\nfor example, a missing double bond (e.g. due to a substitution of a hydrogen atom) \\cite{Su1979,\n  Heeger1988, Nozaki2010}. Such defects produce resonances within the band gap, similar to the\nobserved resonances due to edge atoms. A single defect has been used recently to establish a robust\ntopological mode, which could be used for quantum computation \\cite{Schomerus2013,\n  Poli2015}. Studies of other conjugated carbon systems using similar experimental methods are in\nprocess. The successful emulation of boron--nitrogen sheets \\cite{Barkhofen2013} suggest that a\nlarger variety of molecules can be studied with similar techniques.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n  Financial support from CONACyT research grant 219993 and PAPIIT-DGAPA-UNAM research grants\n  IG100616 and IN114014 is acknowledged.
