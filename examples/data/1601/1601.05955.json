At late times,\n  SNe~Iax have generally similar spectra, all with a similar continuum\n  shape and strong forbidden-line emission.  However, there is also\n  significant diversity where some SN~Iax spectra display narrow\n  P-Cygni features from permitted lines and a continuum indicative of\n  a photosphere at late times in addition to strong narrow forbidden\n  lines, while others have no obvious P-Cygni features, strong broad\n  forbidden lines, and weak narrow forbidden lines.  Finally, some\n  SNe~Iax have spectra intermediate to these two varieties with weak\n  P-Cygni features and broad/narrow forbidden lines of similar\n  strength.  We find that SNe~Iax with strong broad forbidden lines\n  also tend to be more luminous and have higher-velocity ejecta at\n  peak brightness.  We find no evidence for dust formation in the SN\n  ejecta or the presence of circumstellar dust, including for the\n  infrared-bright SN~2014dt.  Late-time SN~Iax spectra have strong\n  [\\ion{Ni}{II}] emission, which must come from stable Ni, requiring\n  electron captures that can only occur at the high densities of a\n  (nearly) Chandrasekhar-mass WD.  Therefore, such a star is the\n  likely progenitor of SNe~Iax.  We estimate blackbody and kinematic\n  radii of the late-time photosphere, finding the latter an order of\n  magnitude larger than the former for at least one SN~Iax.  We\n  propose a two-component model that solves this discrepancy and\n  explains the diversity of the late-time spectra of SNe~Iax.  In this\n  model, the broad forbidden lines originate from the SN ejecta,\n  similar to the spectra of all other types of SNe, while the\n  photosphere, P-Cygni lines, and narrow forbidden lines originate\n  from a wind launched from the remnant of the progenitor white dwarf\n  and is driven by the radioactive decay of newly synthesised material\n  left in the remnant.  The relative strength of the two components\n  accounts for the diversity of late-time SN~Iax spectra.  This model\n  also solves the puzzle of a long-lived photosphere and slow\n  late-time decline of SNe~Iax.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\n  {supernovae---general, supernovae---individual (PTF09ego, PTF09eiy,\n    PTF10bvr, SN~2002cx, SN~2004cs, SN~2005P, SN~2005hk, SN~2007J,\n    SN~2008A, SN~2008ge, SN~2008ha, SN~2010ae, SN~2011ay, SN~2011ce,\n    SN~2012Z, SN~2014dt)}\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\defcitealias{Foley13:iax}{F13}\n\\defcitealias{Jha06:02cx}{J06}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{s:intro}\n\nType Iax supernovae (SNe~Iax) are a newly defined class of stellar\ndeath \\citep[][hereafter \\citetalias{Foley13:iax}]{Foley13:iax}.\nThese thermonuclear explosions are observationally similar to, but\ndistinct from, SNe~Ia.  The main observational differences between the\ntwo classes are related to energetics: SNe~Iax have peak luminosities,\nintegrated luminosity, and near-maximum ejecta velocities that are\nsubstantially lower than that of SNe~Ia\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Filippenko03:02cx, Li03:02cx, Jha06:02cx}, with the\nmost extreme members of the class having peak luminosities and ejecta\nvelocities 1\\% and 20\\% those of typical SNe~Ia, respectively\n\\citep{Foley09:08ha, Foley10:08ha, Stritzinger14:10ae}.\n\nWhile SNe~Ia and Iax have somewhat similar spectra near maximum\nbrightness \\citep[e.g.,][]{Li03:02cx, Branch04, Chornock06,\n  Jha06:02cx, Phillips07, Sahu08, Foley10:08ha, Foley13:iax,\n  Stritzinger14:10ae, Stritzinger15}, the late-time ($t \\gtrsim\n200$~d) spectra of SNe~Iax are more distinct from SNe~Ia and SNe of\nall other classes (\\citealt{Jha06:02cx}; \\citetalias{Foley13:iax};\n\\citealt{McCully14:iax}).  Specifically, even a year after explosion,\nSNe~Iax lack the strong forbidden Fe lines at blue optical wavelengths\n([\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 4200$, [\\ion{Fe}{III}] $\\lambda 4700$, and\n[\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 5270$) and still have a continuum and P-Cygni\nprofiles with very low velocities \\citep[{$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 500~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$};][hereafter\n\\citetalias{Jha06:02cx}]{Jha06:02cx}.\n\nThe large differences at late times likely point to different\nexplosion mechanisms and progenitors for SNe~Ia and Iax.  Since the\nprobable progenitor system of one SN~Iax (SN~2012Z) has been detected\nin pre-explosion images \\citep{McCully14:12z}, while no progenitor\nsystem has yet been detected for SNe~Ia even in deep pre-explosion\nimages \\citep[e.g.,][]{Li11:11fe, Kelly14}, there is additional\nevidence that SNe~Ia and Iax have different progenitor systems,\nalthough this difference may be primarily constrained to the companion\nstars.\n\nCurrently, the leading progenitor model for SNe~Iax is a C/O white\ndwarf (WD) accreting material from a He-star donor \\citep[although see\n\\citealt{Kromer15}]{Foley09:08ha, Foley13:iax, Liu15}.  This model is\nconsistent with all current observational data\n\\citepalias{Foley13:iax} including the probable progenitor detection\nof SN~2012Z \\citep[][and the nondetection of the progenitor system for\nSN~2014dt; \\citealt{Foley15:14dt}]{McCully14:12z}.\n\nBecause of the low ejecta masses required for some SNe~Iax\n\\citep[perhaps as low as 0.1~M$_{\\sun}$; e.g.,][]{Foley09:08ha,\n  Foley10:08ha, McCully14:iax, Valenti09}, there is indirect evidence\nthat the progenitor star is not completely disrupted.  Models of a C/O\nWD undergoing a deflagration that does not fully disrupt the\nprogenitor WD \\citep[e.g.,][]{Jordan12, Kromer13, Kromer15} can\nexplain most of the observations including the low luminosity, low\nejecta velocities, and slow late-time luminosity decline.  However,\nadditional constraints on the explosion mechanism are required for\nfurther progress.  The potential detection of the remnant WD years\nafter SN~2008ha exploded \\citep{Foley14:08ha} would be the most direct\nindication that some SNe~Iax do not completely disrupt their\nprogenitor stars.\n\nHere, we examine the late-time spectra of a sample of 10 SNe~Iax to\nfurther understand the physical mechanisms of this class of SNe.  The\ndiverse spectra at $t > 200$~d after peak brightness provide multiple\nclues about the explosion and the final fate of the progenitor star.\n\nWe describe our sample and data, which includes new observations of\nSN~2014dt, in Section~\\ref{s:sample}. Section~\\ref{s:measure} presents\nvarious physical quantities for the late-time spectra of SNe~Iax and\nthe measurements are analysed in Section~\\ref{s:analysis}.  We discuss\nour findings in Section~\\ref{s:disc} and conclude in\nSection~\\ref{s:conc}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Sample}\\label{s:sample}\n\nFor our sample, we begin with the data presented by\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax}, which represents the largest sample of\nSNe~Iax to date.  This sample contains 25 SNe~Iax, of which 7 have\nlate-time ($t \\gtrsim 200$~d) spectra.  In addition to the data\npresented by \\citetalias{Foley13:iax}, \\citet{Sahu08},\n\\citet{Foley10:08ge}, \\citet{Stritzinger14:10ae}, and\n\\citet{Stritzinger15} present late-time spectra for SNe~2005hk,\n2008ge, 2010ae, and 2012Z, which we include here.  In addition, we use\nthe updated light-curve parameters for SNe~2010ae and 2012Z\n\\citep[respectively]{Stritzinger14:10ae, Stritzinger15}.\n\nWe add to this sample SN~2014dt, the closest SN~Iax yet discovered\n\\citep{Foley15:14dt}.  Below, we present late-time spectra of\nSN~2014dt.\n\nWe also examined the sample of \\citet{White15}, which includes a\ncompilation of six SNe identified as SNe~Iax that are not in the\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax} sample.  In Appendix~\\ref{a:ptf}, we\ndetermine that while four are genuine SNe~Iax, two are most likely not\nSNe~Iax.  Of the genuine \\citet{White15} SNe~Iax, two have spectra at\n$t > 100$~d.  However, none is at $t > 125$~d nor has sufficiently\nhigh quality for inclusion in this analysis.\n\nThe combined sample has 10 SNe~Iax with late-time spectra.  We give\nlight-curve parameters and maximum-light photospheric velocity\nmeasurements for these objects in Table~\\ref{t:max}.  We present the\nphases of our primarily examined spectra in Table~\\ref{t:neb_fit}.\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{llll}\n\n\\tabletypesize{\\footnotesize}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\hspace{-3in}\\tablecaption{SN~Iax Maximum-light Parameters\\label{t:max}}\n\\tablehead{\n\\colhead{SN} &\n\\colhead{$M_{V, {\\rm peak}}$ (mag)} &\n\\colhead{$\\Delta m_{15}(V)$ (mag)} &\n\\colhead{$v_{\\rm ph}$ ({\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$})}}\n\n\\startdata\n\n2002cx & $-17.52$ (0.18) & 0.84 (0.09) & $-5550$ (20) \\\\\n2005P  & \\nodata         & \\nodata     & \\nodata \\\\\n2005hk & $-18.07$ (0.25) & 0.92 (0.01) & $-4490$ (430) \\\\\n2008A  & $-18.16$ (0.15) & 0.82 (0.06) & $-6350$ (160) \\\\\n2008ge & $-17.60$ (0.25) & 0.34 (0.24) & \\nodata \\\\\n2010ae & $-15.33$ (0.54) & 1.15 (0.04) & $-4390$ (60) \\\\\n2011ay & $-18.40$ (0.16) & 0.75 (0.12) & $-5560$ (80) \\\\\n2011ce & \\nodata         & \\nodata     & \\nodata \\\\\n2012Z  & $-18.50$ (0.09) & 0.89 (0.01) & $-6030$ (180) \\\\\n2014dt & $-17.40$ (0.50) & \\nodata     & \\nodata\n\n\\enddata\n\n\\vspace{-0.7cm}\n\\tablecomments{Uncertainties listed in parentheses.}\n\n\\end{deluxetable}\n\n\n\\subsection{SN~2014dt}\n\nThe newest addition to our sample is SN~2014dt, which was detected in\nM61 on 2014 October 29.8 (all dates are UT) at $V = 13.6$~mag by\n\\citet{Nakano14} and promptly classified as a SN~Iax by\n\\citet{Ochner14} from a spectrum obtained 2014 October 31.2.  The SN\nwas past peak at discovery and there are no recent nondetections which\nconstrain the date of explosion.\n\n\\citet{Foley15:14dt} present a spectrum from 2014 November 18.6, 19.6\nrest-frame days after discovery.  Using SNID \\citep{Blondin07}, we\ndetermine that SN~2014dt was at a phase of $+23 \\pm 7$~d for that\nspectrum.  The classification spectrum, taken at 1.4 rest-frame days\nafter discovery, yields a phase of $+15 \\pm 19$~d.  Using both\nconstraints, we estimate that SN~2014dt was discovered $+4 \\pm 7$~d\nafter maximum brightness, consistent with the photometry.  This puts\nmaximum light for SN~2014dt on 2014 October 25 ($\\pm$7~d).\n\nAt discovery, SN~2014dt had an absolute magnitude $M_{V} = -16.9 \\pm\n0.3$~mag, where we use a distance modulus to M61 of $30.45 \\pm\n0.24$~mag\\footnote{\\citet{Fox15} use a distance modulus of 31.43~mag,\n  which is inconsistent with the Tully-Fisher distance \\citep[$\\mu =\n  30.21 \\pm 0.70$~mag;][]{Schoeniger97}, the redshift-derived distance\n  (corrected for Virgo infall; $\\mu = 30.59 \\pm 0.16$~mag), and an\n  expanding photosphere method distance using the SN~II~2008in\n  \\citep[$\\mu = 30.45 \\pm 0.10$~mag or $\\mu = 30.81 \\pm 0.20$~mag,\n  with the difference resulting from different prescriptions and the\n  former being more consistent with external distances for a large\n  sample]{Bose14}.  Their assumed distance comes from a separate\n  analysis of SN~2008in \\citep{Rodriguez14}.  While that distance may\n  be correct, the authors specifically point out that their analysis\n  yields a significant negative extinction for SN~2008in, the only\n  such outlier of their sample.} \\citep{Foley15:14dt}.\n\nSince SN~2014dt was discovered close to peak brightness, the discovery\nmagnitude is a reasonable upper limit on the peak magnitude.  For the\nlower limit, we examine the light curves of other SNe~Iax, which have\na maximum $\\Delta m_{15} (V) = 1$~mag \\citepalias{Foley13:iax}.  Since\nthe SN was discovered before +15~d, a reasonable lower limit is $M_{V}\n= -17.9$~mag.  We use these limits to set the range of peak absolute\nmagnitudes, $M_{V} = -17.4 \\pm 0.5$~mag.\n\nWe obtained a series of low-resolution spectra of SN~2014dt.  Here we\nfocus on the late-time spectra obtained from 2015 April 10 through\nJuly 24, corresponding to phases of 172 to 270~d after $B$-band\nmaximum brightness.  The remainder of our dataset will be presented by\nJha et~al. (in prep.).  The data were obtained with the Goodman\nspectrograph \\citep{Clemens04} on the 4~m SOAR telescope, the Robert\nStobie spectrograph \\citep{Smith06} on the 10~m SALT telescope, the\nKast double spectrograph \\citep{Miller93} on the Shane 3~m telescope\nat Lick Observatory, and the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\n\\citep[LRIS;][]{Oke95} on the 10~m Keck~I telescope.\n\nFor most data, standard CCD processing and spectrum extraction were\naccomplished with IRAF\\footnote{IRAF: the Image Reduction and Analysis\n  Facility is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy\n  Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities\n  for Research in Astronomy, Inc.\\ (AURA) under cooperative agreement\n  with the National Science Foundation (NSF).}.  The SALT spectra were\npartially reduced with PySALT \\citep{Crawford10}. The data were\nextracted using the optimal algorithm of \\citet{Horne86}.  Low-order\npolynomial fits to calibration-lamp spectra were used to establish the\nwavelength scale, and small adjustments derived from night-sky lines\nin the object frames were applied.  We employed our own IDL routines\nto flux calibrate the data and remove telluric lines using the\nwell-exposed continua of spectrophotometric standards \\citep{Wade88,\n  Foley03}.  Details of our spectroscopic reduction techniques are\ndescribed by \\citet{Silverman12:bsnip}.\n\nA log of spectral observations is presented in Table~\\ref{t:spec}, and\nthe spectra are shown in Figure~\\ref{f:14dt_spec}.\n\n\\setcounter{figure}{0}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2014dt_spec}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SN~2014dt.

If a\nlow-velocity SN~Iax spectrum is shifted and smoothed to mimic having a\nhigher ejecta velocity, the result will resemble that of a\nhigher-velocity SN~Iax spectrum.\n\nAt late times, all SN~Iax spectra share certain characteristics.\nThere is always a continuum, and the general shapes of the spectra are\nsimilar.  The spectra all have similar permitted features such as the\n\\ion{Ca}{II} near-infrared (NIR) triplet and \\ion{Na}{I}~D.\nSimilarly, every late-time spectrum has at least some indication of\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission.\n\nHowever, the late-time spectra of SNe~Iax show significant diversity,\nand variance beyond that seen near peak brightness.  While some\nlate-time spectra have obvious low-velocity ({$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 500~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}) P-Cygni\nprofiles \\citepalias[e.g., SN~2002cx;][]{Jha06:02cx}, others have\nhigher velocities blending these lines \\citep[e.g.,\nSN~2008ge;][]{Foley10:08ge}.  In addition to the difference in\nvelocities, there are differences in the strength of forbidden lines.\nIn particular, the [\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$, [\\ion{Ca}{II}]\n$\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324, and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$\nfeatures have significantly different line strengths and widths.\n\nExample spectra of objects having (1) high velocity, strong\n[\\ion{Ni}{II}], and weak [\\ion{Ca}{II}] (SN~2008ge), (2) low velocity,\nweak [\\ion{Ni}{II}], and strong [\\ion{Ca}{II}] (SN~2002cx), and (3)\nintermediate properties (SN~2008A) are displayed in\nFigure~\\ref{f:example}.  These three spectra are indicative of the\nmain differences among late-time SN~Iax spectra.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=6.8in]{example}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SNe~2002cx at a phase of +227~d, (red\n    curve), 2008A at a phase of +220~d (black curve), and 2008ge at a\n    phase of +225~d (blue curve).  The left panel shows the entire\n    optical region, while the right panel displays the region\n    containing the [\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$, [\\ion{Ca}{II}]\n    $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324, and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$\n    features (all labeled).  The SN~2002cx spectrum has a relatively\n    high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), and the small-amplitude features\n    in the SN~2002cx spectrum are mostly real \\citepalias{Jha06:02cx}.\n    This figure displays the heterogeneous late-time spectra of\n    SNe~Iax.}\\label{f:example}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nSN~2002cx has low velocities at late times resulting in numerous\nP-Cygni features being visible at all optical wavelengths.  It has no\nobvious [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$ emission, but relatively strong\n[\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$ and [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda\n7291$, 7324.  SN~2008ge has lines broad enough such that individual\nP-Cygni profiles are not obvious except for the strongest lines (e.g.,\nNa~D and the Ca NIR triplet).  None the less, its continuum is\nconsistent with that of SN~2002cx, perhaps indicating that the main\ndifference between SNe~2002cx and 2008ge at late phases is that the\nlatter has higher-velocity material.  The [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda\n7378$ and [\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$ features for SN~2008ge are\nvery strong and somewhat strong, respectively, while its\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324 emission is barely\nnoticeable as small notches on the wings of the [\\ion{Ni}{II}]\n$\\lambda 7378$ profile.\n\nSN~2008A is intermediate to SNe~2002cx and 2008ge.  It has broad\nfeatures similar to SN~2008ge, but there are weak, low-velocity\nP-Cygni profiles superimposed on the broader features.  Its\n[\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$ emission is similar to that of both\nSNe~2002cx and 2008ge, but noticeably narrower than that of SN~2008ge.\nIts [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324 emission is relatively\nstrong.  The [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$ emission is sufficiently\nstrong to produce a pronounced ``shoulder'' on the [\\ion{Ca}{II}]\nprofile, but is not strong enough to have a defined peak.\n\nFurthermore, there are obvious line shifts between the different\nspectra.  The peaks of the forbidden lines are progressively shifted\nfurther to the blue from SN~2008ge to SN~2008A to SN~2002cx.\n\nWhile there are additional differences between these spectra, as well\nas for other spectra in our sample, these are the most obvious.  They\nshape the initial investigations discussed below.\n\n\\subsection{Forbidden-Line Diversity}\\label{ss:for}\n\nAs noted above, the [\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$, [\\ion{Ca}{II}]\n$\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324, and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$\nforbidden lines show significant diversity in the late-time spectra of\nSNe~Iax.  Here we fit these features to measure line strengths,\nvelocity shifts, and velocity widths.\n\nWe fit multiple Gaussian profiles to all late-time SN~Iax spectra in\nthe region 6900 -- 7700~\\AA.  Although this ignores other spectral\nfeatures in this region, the emission in this region is typically well\ndescribed by emission from only the four features listed above.  For\nsome spectra, it was obvious that two components (a ``broad''\ncomponent with a velocity width of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 8000~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ full width at\nhalf-maximum intensity (FWHM), and a ``narrow'' component with a\nvelocity width of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 1000~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ FWHM) were necessary, with each\nnarrow/broad feature having the same kinematic properties (velocity\nshift and velocity width) as the other narrow/broad features.  No\nspectrum has obvious broad [\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission.\n\nWe fit the spectra with 4 kinematic parameters (2 each for the narrow\nand broad components), 5 parameters to describe the line strengths\n(fixing each [\\ion{Ca}{II}] line to have the same flux), and a\nconstant flux offset, for a total of 10 parameters.  For a subset, the\nfitting procedure could not distinguish between a constant flux offset\nand low-flux, extremely broad, often extremely offset emission\nfeatures; in such cases (SNe~2002cx, 2010ae, and 2011ce), we fixed\nthese broad features to have zero flux, effectively removing the broad\ncomponents from the fit.  We also tried fitting each feature\nseparately, but found the parameters for the features from each\nkinematic component to be essentially identical.  The best-fitting\nmodels are shown in Figure~\\ref{f:neb_fit} and the parameters are\nlisted in Table~\\ref{t:neb_fit}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=6.8in]{neb_fit}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SNe~Iax (black).

The blue\n    dotted curves and the gold dashed curves correspond to the\n    individual narrow and broad components,\n    respectively.}\\label{f:neb_fit}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nIn each case, the 10-parameter fit is generally a good description of\nthe data.  In some cases (particularly SNe~2002cx, 2005hk, 2010ae,\n2011ce, and 2014dt), there are additional features, mostly\ncorresponding to permitted \\ion{Fe}{II} lines \\citepalias{Jha06:02cx},\nwhich are not well fit by this model.  We do not attempt to account\nfor these features.  In particular, we note that as seen in the\nspectral sequence of SN~2014dt (Section~\\ref{ss:evol};\nFigure~\\ref{f:14dt_diff}), there appears to be a feature at roughly\nthe position of [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda 7324$ which is unlikely to be\nthat line.  This feature is present in the 172-day spectrum of\nSN~2014dt, but there is no similar line at 7291~\\AA.  In all later\nepochs (from +203~d onward), the [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda 7291$ line is\npresent and of similar strength to [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda 7324$,\nthough we caution that the other, contaminating line may result in\nsuboptimal fitting of these features, but should not significantly\naffect our results for the spectra we examine.  None the less, future\ninvestigations may employ a more detailed analysis where other lines,\nincluding permitted features, are also fitted.\n\nFrom the fitting, we can see at least three types of behaviour.  There\nare SNe~Iax where the narrow components dominate, corresponding to\nSNe~2002cx, 2005hk, 2010ae, and 2011ce; SNe~Iax where the broad\ncomponents dominate, corresponding to SNe~2008ge, 2011ay, and 2012Z;\nand SNe~Iax where the narrow and broad components are roughly similar\nin strength, corresponding to SNe~2005P, 2008A, and 2014dt.  These\ncorrespond to the rough characterisation made at the beginning of\nSection~\\ref{s:measure} and in Figure~\\ref{f:example}.\n\nWhile several SNe have no discernible broad components, all SNe have\nat least some narrow emission.  We can remove the need for narrow\ncomponents in SN~2011ay if we do not require that the broad components\nhave the same velocity shifts and velocity widths.  However, the broad\ncomponents appear to have the same widths and shifts for all other\nSNe~Iax, and all other SNe~Iax require at least some narrow emission\nfor a reasonable fit.  As such, we include the narrow lines in its\nfit, but caution overinterpretation of the strength of these features.\n\nBelow, we analyze the correlations between these parameters.\n\n\\subsection{Spectral Evolution with Time}\\label{ss:evol}\n\nOnly a few SNe~Iax have multiple late-time spectra.  Of these objects,\nSN~2002cx has two spectra separated by only 50~d \\citepalias[+227 and\n+277~d;][]{Jha06:02cx}.  SN~2005hk has at least 4 late-time spectra,\nspanning a period of +230~d to +455~d \\citep[although the last\nspectrum with a detected continuum is at +403~d;][]{McCully14:iax}.\nSN~2008A has four late-time spectra spanning +200~d to +283~d\n\\citep{McCully14:iax}.  SN~2012Z has two spectra at +215 and +248~d\n\\citep[a difference of only 33~d;][]{Stritzinger15}.  Finally,\nSN~2014dt has multiple late-time spectra spanning +172 to +410~d.  For\nSNe~2002cx and 2012Z, the time spans are relatively short, and there\nis no obvious difference in the spectra at our disposal.  Therefore,\nthere are three SNe worth further investigation: SNe~2005hk, 2008A,\nand 2014dt.\n\nFor SN~2005hk, there is very little difference in the spectral\nappearance between +230 and +403~d (Figure~\\ref{f:sn2005hk}).\nAlthough roughly 6 months has passed between these epochs, and the SN\nis nearly twice as old in the second epoch as in the first and has\nfaded significantly, the spectra are nearly identical.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2005hk_spec}\n  \\caption{{\\it Top panel}: Late-time spectra of SN~2005hk at phases\n    of roughly $+230$ (top, black curve) and $+403$~d (bottom, blue\n    curve), respectively.  The spectra are nearly identical in\n    appearance despite the SN fading significantly between these\n    epochs.  {\\it Bottom panel}: Residual spectrum for these two\n    spectra where the earlier spectrum is subtracted from the later\n    spectrum.  The main difference is in the [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda\n    \\lambda 7291$, 7324 feature.  This difference is the result of the\n    lines becoming somewhat narrower with time (see\n    Figure~\\ref{f:sn2005hk2}).}\\label{f:sn2005hk}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nExamining the differences between the two spectra\n(Figure~\\ref{f:sn2005hk}), we note that there is a slight difference\nin the continuum strength, which may be the result of small errors in\nflux calibration or a slight change to the temperature of the\nphotosphere.  Additionally, the [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$,\n7324 lines have a smaller equivalent width (EW) in the later spectrum\n(Figure~\\ref{f:sn2005hk}).  This difference is caused by the\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}] lines becoming narrower, with the FWHM decreasing from\n290~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ to 230~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}, and moving slightly to the red (as determined\nby simultaneously fitting both lines with Gaussians), with the\nvelocity shift increasing from $-360$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ to $-180$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ (where a\nnegative velocity indicates a blueshifted feature;\nFigure~\\ref{f:sn2005hk2}).  Similar behaviour is seen in the permitted\nlines.  The decrease in velocity for both the permitted and narrow\nforbidden lines suggests a physical connection.  We note that these\nvelocity shifts are unlikely to be caused by reddening from newly\nformed dust; in that case, we would expect the lines to shift to the\nblue \\citep[e.g.,][]{Smith08:06jc}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2005hk_spec2}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SN~2005hk at phases of roughly $+230$\n    (black curve) and $+403$~d (blue curve), respectively.

Again, SN~2008A has faded significantly between\nthese epochs.  While most of the spectrum is nearly identical during\nthis time (Figure~\\ref{f:sn2008a}), the strengths of the forbidden\nlines ([\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$, [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda\n7291$, 7324, and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$) change dramatically\nbetween the three epochs (at +200, +224, and +283~d).  Most of this\nevolution occurs between +224 and +283~d, with only minor changes to\nthe features between +200 and +224~d.  While the forbidden-line\nstrengths change, the SN does not transition to (or from) a spectrum\nmore similar to SN~2002cx or SN~2008ge; SN~2008A always has relatively\nstrong narrow and forbidden lines.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2008a_spec}\n  \\caption{{\\it Top panel}: Late-time spectra of SN~2008A at phases of\n    roughly $+200$ (bottom, black curve), $+224$~d (middle, blue\n    curve), and $+283$~d (top, red curve), respectively.  The spectra\n    are nearly identical, except for at wavelengths of 7000 --\n    7600~\\AA.  {\\it Bottom panel}: Residual spectra for these spectra\n    where the $+200$~d spectrum is subtracted from the later spectra.\n    The main differences are in [\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$,\n    [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324, and [\\ion{Ni}{II}]\n    $\\lambda 7378$, with the later spectra having generally stronger\n    lines.}\\label{f:sn2008a}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nExamining the forbidden lines in detail (Figure~\\ref{f:sn2008a2}), we\nsee that the narrow components (see Section~\\ref{ss:for}) of the lines\nall get stronger (in EW) by factors of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 2--5 between +224 and\n+283~d.  This is most obvious in the [\\ion{Ca}{II}] doublet, which\nincreases in strength by a factor of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 4 and is clearly the\ndominant feature in the +283~d spectrum.  The broad [\\ion{Fe}{II}]\nfeature is roughly the same strength in both spectra, but the broad\n[\\ion{Ni}{II}] feature is {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 50\\% stronger in the later spectrum.\nThis behaviour may be the result of the continuum fading while the\nnarrow features stay relatively constant in flux.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2008a_spec2}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SN~2008A at phases of roughly $+200$\n    (black curve) and $+283$~d (dark-blue curve), respectively.

The velocity widths of the broad\ncomponents do not significantly change either.  However, detailed\nmodeling of the full complex, including permitted-line emission, may\nreveal subtle shifts.\n\nFinally, SN~2014dt has the best spectral sequence of any SN~Iax at\nlate times.  The details of the spectral evolution will be presented\nby Jha et~al.\\ (in prep.); here we focus on the region around the\nforbidden lines already identified.  We display that spectral region\nin Figure~\\ref{f:14dt_diff}.  In Figure~\\ref{f:14dt_diff}, we also\nshow the residual spectra compared to the +270~d spectrum.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=6.8in]{sn2014dt_diff}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SN~2014dt from 172 to 270~d after\n    maximum brightness, focusing on the forbidden-line region.

The bottom panels of each row show\n    the residual spectrum relative to the +270~d spectrum after they\n    have been arbitrarily scaled to have their continua match just\n    blueward and redward of the forbidden-line complex.  The red\n    dashed lines represent zero residual flux.}\\label{f:14dt_diff}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nNotably, the spectra do not evolve from being similar to SN~2002cx\ninto being similar to SN~2008ge (or vice versa; see\nFigure~\\ref{f:example}).  The main changes are the continued decrease\nin a broad feature that is presumably [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$\nwith perhaps some contribution from [\\ion{Fe}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$, and\nthe strengthening of narrow [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$,\n7324.  Despite these noticeable differences between different phases,\nthere is very little spectral evolution between +203 and +410~d.  The\n172-day spectrum is less similar to the other spectra and likely is\nstill transitioning into being a true ``late-time'' spectrum.  This\nrelative stability implies that a single spectrum taken after about\n200~d relative to maximum brightness is sufficient to characterise the\nlate-time spectrum of a SN~Iax.  While this statement is consistent\nwith our findings for SNe~2005hk and 2014dt, more data will be\nnecessary to determine if the evolution seen in SN~2008A typically\noccurs primarily around +270~d or continues steadily between +230 and\n+270~d.\n\nDespite the evolutionary changes seen in SNe~2005hk, 2008A, and\n2014dt, they are all relatively small and any such late-time evolution\nshould not significantly affect our results below.\n\n\n\\subsection{Velocity Shifts}\n\nAs is evident from Figures~\\ref{f:example} and \\ref{f:neb_fit}, as\nwell as Table~\\ref{t:neb_fit}, there are large differences in the\nforbidden-line shifts in late-time SN~Iax spectra.  These shifts can\nbe caused by the motion of the progenitor system or asymmetries in the\nexplosion.\n\nIn addition to forbidden-line shifts, the permitted features are at\ndifferent velocities for different SNe.  To determine the relative\nvelocity shifts between spectra, we cross-correlated the SN~2005hk\nspectrum and other spectra.  From the measured lag, we can directly\nmeasure the velocity shift.  SN~2005hk was used since it has (1) a\nvery high-S/N spectrum; (2) relatively low-velocity features, allowing\nfor precise measurements of any shifts; and (3) both narrow and broad\nforbidden lines.\n\nPerforming the cross-correlation, we decided to examine different\nwavelength ranges.  We measured cross correlations using essentially\nall data (4600 -- 9000~\\AA), a blue region (4600 -- 6500~\\AA, limited\non the red side to avoid any possible correlation with galactic\nH$\\alpha$ emission), a red region (7600 -- 9000~\\AA, bounded on the\nblue side to avoid the strong forbidden lines discussed above), a\nforbidden-line region (6900 -- 7600~\\AA), as well as disjoint\n1000~\\AA\\ regions starting at 5000 -- 6000~\\AA\\ and ending at 8000 --\n9000~\\AA.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many of the derived cross-correlation velocities are\nstrongly correlated with each other.  Interestingly, the\nforbidden-line region is uncorrelated with all nonoverlapping regions.\nThe highest correlation is with the red region: a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.14.  The forbidden-line region has a higher\nanticorrelation with the 5000 -- 6000~\\AA\\ region (correlation\ncoefficient of $-0.51$).\n\nHowever, half of the SN~Iax sample (SNe~2002cx, 2005P, 2005hk, 2010ae,\n2011ce, and 2014dt) have forbidden-line shifts similar to that of the\npermitted lines.  Notably, these are the SNe~Iax with the weakest\nbroad emission lines and their forbidden-line shifts are primarily\ndetermined from the narrow forbidden lines.  The remaining SNe have\nforbidden-line shifts that are significantly offset from their\npermitted-line shifts, as determined by cross correlation.\n\nExamining the velocity shifts for the narrow forbidden lines as\ndetermined in Section~\\ref{ss:for}, the permitted line shifts are now\nrelatively correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.47.\nComparing these values, the outliers are SNe~2008A, 2008ge, and 2012Z.\nUnsurprisingly, these are 3/4 of the SNe~Iax with the weakest narrow\nforbidden lines.  Although a possible interpretation is that the\nnarrow-component forbidden-line velocity shifts are poorly measured\nfor these SNe, the narrow lines are clearly seen in SN~2008A.  Another\ninterpretation is that the physical regions producing the permitted\nand forbidden lines are essentially independent of each other for the\nSNe with strong broad forbidden lines.\n\nSince the velocity shifts for the broad forbidden lines and permitted\nlines, even when there are no narrow P-Cygni features visible, are\nuncorrelated, it is likely that the material from which the broad\nforbidden lines are formed and the photosphere, which is where the\ncontinuum originates, are physically distinct.  However, the\ncorrelation with the narrow forbidden lines and permitted lines\nsuggests that those components {\\it do} originate from the same\nmaterial.  These results favour the idea that late-time SNe~Iax are\ncomposed of two physically distinct regions.\n\nNone the less, the photosphere and the material generating the broad\nforbidden lines are somehow connected.  The SNe~Iax with the broadest\nforbidden lines also lack distinct low-velocity P-Cygni features,\nsuggesting that SNe~Iax with higher-velocity photospheres also have\nhigher-velocity, and more blueshifted, broad forbidden-line-forming\nregions.\n\n\\subsection{Principal-component Analysis}\\label{ss:pca}\n\nTo investigate the possibility that late-time SN~Iax spectra have\ndistinct physical components and to further examine correlations\nbetween spectral features, we perform a principal-component analysis\n(PCA) of the spectra.  To do this, we subtract the average flux from\neach spectrum and scale each spectrum to have a similar flux.  We also\nshift the spectra in velocity space by their narrow forbidden emission\nline velocity shift.  This last step reduces differences from small\nvelocity shifts and focuses the analysis on differences in\nemission-line strengths and widths.\n\nWe present the first 5 eigenvalues for each SN in Table~\\ref{t:eigen}.\nFigure~\\ref{f:pca} displays the first 5 eigenspectra for our sample\n(all normalised to have the same maximum amplitude).  The first 5\neigenspectra represent 40.8, 26.5, 11.0, 7.7, and 4.6\\% of the total\nvariance between spectra, respectively.  Cumulatively, this\ncorresponds to 40.8, 67.3, 78.3, 85.9, and 90.5\\% of the total\nvariance.\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{lrrrrr}\n\\centering\n\n\\tabletypesize{\\footnotesize}\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablecaption{Eigenvalues for Late-time SN~Iax Spectra\\label{t:eigen}}\n\\tablehead{\n\\colhead{SN} &\n\\colhead{1st} &\n\\colhead{2nd} &\n\\colhead{3rd} &\n\\colhead{4th} &\n\\colhead{5th}}\n\n\\startdata\n\n2002cx &    1.1  &  10.4  &  1.6 & $-11.2$ &  $-1.2$\\\\\n2005P  &   15.7  &  18.3  & 12.9 &  $-3.6$ &  $-9.9$\\\\\n2005hk &  $-9.2$ &  23.0  & 33.1 &  $-0.6$ &  $-1.2$\\\\\n2008A  &   32.2  &  31.2  & 15.2 &    1.4  & $-12.9$\\\\\n2008ge &   27.9  &  15.0  & 16.7 &    6.8  &  $-4.2$\\\\\n2010ae & $-14.8$ &  51.8  &  2.9 &    5.8  &  $-4.4$\\\\\n2011ay &   22.8  &  15.3  &  3.6 &    2.0  &  $-6.5$\\\\\n2011ce & $-10.8$ & $-0.8$ &  8.2 &   16.3  &  $-8.0$\\\\\n2012Z  &   32.9  &  25.7  &  9.6 &    8.4  &    8.9\\\\\n2014dt &    0.4  &   8.7  & 11.0 &  $-1.7$ &    0.3\n\n\\enddata\n\n\\end{deluxetable}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{pca_vec}\n  \\caption{First five eigenspectra for late-time SN~Iax spectra.  The\n    ``zero flux'' is annotated as a dotted line for each\n    eigenspectrum.}\\label{f:pca}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe eigenspectra show interesting correlations between features,\nincluding some correlations not identified in the previous sections.\nIn the first eigenspectrum, the main features are broad components to\nthe forbidden lines with anticorrelated narrow components.  That is,\nthe first eigenspectrum describes the relative strengths of the broad\nand narrow forbidden lines.  Additionally, the first eigenspectrum\nalso has a blue continuum correlated with stronger broad components.\nIt is unclear if the colour difference is the result of additional\nemission at these wavelengths or caused by (uncorrected) dust\nreddening (the latter is unlikely since the bluer continuum is\ncorrelated with narrow Na~D absorption that is likely ISM absorption;\nintriguingly, we are unable to detect any narrow Na~D within the broad\nNa~D associated with the SN, but the eigenspectra are able to isolate\nthis feature).  Finally, the first eigenspectrum shows a correlation\nbetween high-frequency permitted lines and the strength of the narrow\nforbidden lines.  Therefore, the first eigenspectrum suggests that\nSNe~Iax with relatively strong narrow forbidden lines (and weaker\nbroad forbidden lines) have more distinct permitted features.\n\nThe second eigenspectrum is basically a flat spectrum with mostly\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324 emission.  This component\nis essentially uncorrelated with any other feature, although there is\nweak, narrow [\\ion{Fe}{II}] emission correlated with the\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission.  The continuum is slightly negative at nearly\nevery wavelength, indicating that the overall continuum strength is\nanticorrelated with the strength of the [\\ion{Ca}{II}] feature.\n\nThe third eigenspectrum has correlated narrow and broad forbidden\nlines that are anticorrelated with a blue continuum.  This both\nconfirms the necessity of broad and narrow forbidden lines and is a\nkey discriminant for ``transition'' objects.  The fourth eigenspectrum\nshows a correlation between narrow [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7155$ and\nbroad \\ion{Ca}{II} NIR emission.  The fifth eigenspectrum exhibits\n``P-Cygni-like'' features for the broad emission lines, and is likely\nrelated to velocity shifts for the broad emission relative to the\nnarrow emission.\n\nFigure~\\ref{f:pca_example} displays the SNe~2002cx, 2008A, and 2008ge\nspectra (the same as in Figure~\\ref{f:example}) compared to their\nprogressively reconstructed spectra.  That is, the first comparison\nshows the first eigenspectrum multiplied by the first eigenvalue for\nthat spectrum, while the second comparison shows that same projected\nspectrum added to the second eigenspectrum multiplied by the second\neigenvalue for that spectrum.  If there were zero variance beyond the\nfifth eigenspectrum, the final comparison would be equivalent to both\nthe reconstructed spectrum and the true spectrum.  For these spectra,\na reconstruction using the first 5 eigenspectra results in reasonable\nreproductions of the data.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{pca_example}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SNe~2002cx (top panel), 2008A (middle\n    panel), and 2008ge (bottom panel) repeated in black.

Examining the eigenvalues for each\nspectrum, it is clear that the first eigenvalue is highly correlated\nwith the strength of the broad forbidden lines, with SNe~2008A,\n2008ge, 2011ay, and 2012Z having the largest (positive) eigenvalues\nand SNe~2005hk, 2010ae, and 2011ce having the smallest (negative)\neigenvalues.\n\nThe second eigenvalues are positive for all SNe except for SN~2011ce.\nWhile one might naively think that the second eigenvalue dictates the\nstrength of the observed [\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission, this is only\npartially correct.  Spectra having large (positive) first eigenvalues\nalso need large second eigenvalues to ``fill in'' the ``absorption,''\nwhile negative first eigenvalues result in some [\\ion{Ca}{II}]\nemission, and so the size of the second eigenvalue is not perfectly\ncorrelated with the observed [\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission.\n\nThe second eigenvalue more directly tracks the continuum strength.\nFor instance, the SNe with the largest second eigenvalue are\nSNe~2005hk, 2008A, 2010ae, and 2012Z, all of which have a small\ncontinuum level relative to their emission lines (see\nFigure~\\ref{f:example}).  However, SNe~2002cx, 2011ce, and 2014dt,\nwhich have small second eigenvalues, all have relatively high continua\nrelative to their emission lines.\n\nThe third eigenvalue provides some indication if a SN has a\n``transition'' spectrum with both narrow and broad components.  The\nSNe with the largest third eigenvalue, from strongest to weakest, are\nSNe~2005hk, 2008ge, 2008A, 2005P, and 2014dt.  While not a direct\ncorrespondence, this group does include our previously identified\ntransition objects and excludes the most extreme members of the class\non both ends (e.g., SNe~2010ae and 2011ay).\n\nAdditional eigenspectra have more complicated interpretations.\nHowever, we caution against overinterpretation of the eigenspectra.\nThe correlations, especially for less-significant eigenspectra, do not\nnecessarily correspond to a physical cause and effect rather than\nsimply correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Analysis}\\label{s:analysis}\n\nIn Section~\\ref{s:measure}, we described three different methods to\nexamine the late-time (($t \\gtrsim 200$~d) spectra of SNe~Iax:\nmodel-fitting of forbidden lines, cross-correlation to determine\nvelocity shifts, and a PCA.  Here, we combine measurements from these\nmethods along with other extant data to examine the causes of the\nspectroscopic diversity of SNe~Iax at late times.\n\nIn addition to the velocity shifts, velocity widths, line strengths,\nline ratios, and eigenvalues derived above, we examine other SN\nproperties as reported in other studies.  In particular, we\ninvestigate the peak luminosity, the light-curve shape, and the\nphotospheric velocity at maximum brightness.\n\n\\subsection{Spectral Comparisons}\n\nWe first examine the broad and narrow components of the forbidden\nlines individually.  For the broad components, there is a strong\ncorrelation between the velocity shift and the velocity width\n\\citepalias[Figure~\\ref{f:broad}; see also][]{Foley13:iax}.\nSpecifically, SNe~Iax with blueshifted broad components tend to be\nbroader than SNe with broad components that have no velocity shift or\nare redshifted.  The correlation coefficient for this relation is\n$-0.54$; however, the true relation appears to be stronger than this\nnumber suggests.  Performing a Bayesian Monte-Carlo linear regression\non the data \\citep{Kelly07}, we exclusively found non-negative slopes\nfor the fitted lines in all of 200,000 trials, making the results\nsignificant at $>$5.5~$\\sigma$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{broadvel_broadwidth}\n  \\caption{Line width as a function of velocity shifts for the broad\n    forbidden-line components as fitted in Section~\\ref{ss:for}.

However, some SNe~Iax appear to have truly\nblueshifted features (SNe~2008A and 2012Z).  While this may be caused\nby chance (such a distribution has a {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 13\\% chance of occurring),\nit is also possible that SNe~Iax tend to have their broad nebular\nemission blueshifted or do not have broad emission {\\it at all}.\n\nThis latter explanation is consistent with the correlation between\nwidth/strength and shift for these features.  In this scenario, a\nweaker ``broad'' component will be narrower and less blueshifted.  The\nextreme of this situation would be a ``broad'' component which is\neither too weak to be detected or too narrow to be distinguished from\na separate ``narrow'' component.\n\nWe also examined the similar measurements for the narrow components.\nHere the correlation between line shift and width was not strong ($r =\n-0.17$).  There may be some correlation for the narrow lines, but\nSNe~2008ge and 2011ay, which have the most blueshifted and redshifted\nlines (respectively), and thus highly influence any relation, pull the\nresult in opposite directions.  As both have weak narrow lines, either\ncould be a systemic outlier, but it is currently impossible to\ndetermine if either is.  Alternatively, the underlying physical\nrelation may be between the magnitude of the shift (i.e., the absolute\nvalue) and the width of the line, for which there is a strong\ncorrelation ($r = 0.88$).  With additional data, this relation should\nbe re-examined.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the strength of each individual broad/narrow component\nis (in general) highly correlated with each other.  The strength of\nthe two broad features have a correlation coefficient of 0.93, while\nthe narrow [\\ion{Fe}{II}] and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] ([\\ion{Ca}{II}]) features\nhave a correlation coefficient of 0.78 (0.46).  The [\\ion{Ca}{II}] and\nnarrow [\\ion{Ni}{II}] have a correlation coefficient of 0.61.\n\nNext, we compare the properties of the broad and narrow components of\nthe forbidden lines.  As seen above, and especially as determined from\nthe first eigenspectrum, the height of the (narrow) [\\ion{Ca}{II}]\n$\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324 emission is anticorrelated with the\nheight of the broad [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$ emission.  While the\nheights of these features are moderately anticorrelated ($r = -0.52$),\nthe EWs are uncorrelated ($r = -0.06$; Figure~\\ref{f:comparison}).\n\nThere is also no correlation between the velocity shifts of the narrow\nand broad components.  Figure~\\ref{f:comparison} compares these two\nvalues, showing no trend.\n\nThe broad and narrow components are generally uncorrelated.  While\nthere is some trend that SNe~Iax with ``stronger'' [\\ion{Ca}{II}]\nemission have ``weaker'' broad [\\ion{Ni}{II}] emission, this is not\nseen in the EW measurements for these features.  This may be partially\ncaused by the anticorrelation between the continuum flux and\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission (Section~\\ref{ss:pca}).  Again, the lack of a\nstrong connection between the broad and weak components indicates that\nthey come from physically distinct components and perhaps physically\ndistinct mechanisms.\n\nOur physical interpretation of the eigenspectra in\nSection~\\ref{ss:pca} is confirmed by comparing the eigenvalues of each\nspectrum to spectral parameters.  For instance, the first and second\neigenvalues predict the strength of the broad [\\ion{Ni}{II}] and\nnarrow [\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission, respectively\n(Figure~\\ref{f:eigen_ew}).  As such, the eigenvalues can be used as a\nproxy for these values when it is difficult to measure them directly.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.3in]{broad_eigen}\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.3in]{narrow_eigen}\n  \\caption{Broad [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$ (left) and narrow\n    [\\ion{Ca}{II}] $\\lambda \\lambda 7291$, 7324 (right) EWs as a\n    function of the first and second eigenvalues,\n    respectively.}\\label{f:eigen_ew}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFinally, we compare the late-time spectral properties to those at\nmaximum brightness.  \\citetalias{Foley13:iax} presented maximum-light\n\\ion{Si}{II} $\\lambda 6355$ velocities for SNe~2002cx, 2005hk, 2008A,\n2011ay, and 2012Z.  In addition, we use the spectrum of SN~2010ae\npresented by \\citet{Foley13:ca}, which was obtained at $+0.8$~d, to\nmeasure a maximum-light velocity of $-4390 \\pm 60$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}.  Therefore,\nsix members of our sample have maximum-brightness measurements of\ntheir ejecta velocity.\n\nWhile there is some correlation between maximum-brightness ejecta\nvelocities and properties of the broad forbidden lines, the\nstatistical significance (partially because SN~2010ae does not have a\nmeasured broad component) for any potential correlation is low.\n\nHowever, the photospheric velocity is highly correlated ($r = 0.93$)\nwith the first eigenspectrum (Figure~\\ref{f:vph_eigen}).  That is, the\nlargest portion of the variance in the late-time spectra of SNe~Iax is\nphysically connected to the ejecta velocity at maximum brightness.\nSpecifically, SNe with low measured ejecta velocities at maximum\nbrightness tend to have late-time spectra with weak/absent broad\nforbidden lines and strong narrow [\\ion{Ca}{II}] lines.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{vphot_eigen}\n  \\caption{Comparison of maximum-light \\ion{Si}{II} $\\lambda 6355$\n    velocity and first eigenspectrum of the late-time\n    spectrum.}\\label{f:vph_eigen}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Spectral--Photometric Comparisons}\n\nUsing the subsample of SNe~Iax that have both late-time spectra and\nphotometric properties such as $M_{V}$ and $\\Delta m_{15}$, we\nexamined potential correlations between the photometric properties and\nthose derived from the late-time spectra.\n\nThere are no strong correlations between $\\Delta m_{15} (V)$, the\ndecline-rate parameter observed for most SNe~Iax in our sample, and\nthe appearance of the late-time spectra.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between the the peak absolute magnitude\nin the $V$ band ($M_{V, {\\rm peak}}$) and both the velocity shift ($r\n= 0.83$; Figure~\\ref{f:broadmv}) and width ($r = -0.85$) of the broad\nforbidden lines.  While the first eigenvalue is also correlated with\n$M_{V, {\\rm peak}}$ ($r = 0.68$), it is not as highly correlated as\nthe direct measurements of the broad forbidden lines.  This is not\ncaused by the addition of SN~2010ae (which was excluded from the\nprevious comparisons because of a lack of an identifiable broad\ncomponent); excluding SN~2010ae decreases the correlation between the\nfirst eigenvalue and $M_{V, {\\rm peak}}$ to $r = 0.51$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{broadshift_mv}\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{broadwidth_mv}\n  \\caption{Peak absolute $V$ magnitude as a function of velocity\n    shifts (left) and velocity width (right) for the broad\n    forbidden-line components as fitted in Section~\\ref{ss:for}.

Two possible explanations for\nthis correlation are either (1) SNe~Iax that produce more $^{56}$Ni\n(and are thus more luminous at peak) also produce higher-velocity\nejecta at all layers of the ejecta, or (2) SNe~Iax explosions are\nasymmetric and lines of sight pointed along the ``high-velocity axis''\nare also more luminous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{s:disc}\n\n\\subsection{A Nearly Chandrasekhar-Mass Explosion}\n\nOur identification of the [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$ line in the\nlate-time spectra of SNe~Iax is a strong indication of the presence of\nstable nickel isotopes (e.g., $^{58}$Ni) in the ejecta, as by $>$200~d\nafter the explosion, radioactive $^{56}$Ni will have decayed to a\nfraction {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} $10^{-10}$ of its original abundance.\n\nExplosion models which produce a deflagration flame that fails to\nunbind the progenitor WD\\footnote{These models are sometimes referred\n  to as ``failed deflagration'' models, despite the fact that the\n  deflagration is successful.} can reproduce the rough spectral and\nphotometric properties of SNe~Iax \\citep{Jordan12, Kromer13,\n  Kromer15}.  These models employ a (nearly) $M_{\\rm Ch}$ WD\nprogenitor.  The burning is ignited in the core of this star, which\nhas a sufficiently high density that electron capture produces\nneutronised isotopes such as $^{54}$Fe and $^{58}$Ni\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Thielemann86}.\n\nContrastingly, detonations occurring in (or on) sub-Chandrasekhar WDs\nhave densities too low for electron capture to occur.  Although a\nsmall amount of $^{58}$Ni may be synthesised using the excess neutrons\nfrom high-neutron species in the progenitor \\citep[primarily\n$^{22}$Ne;][]{Timmes03}, it is expected that the amount of $^{58}$Ni\nis significantly less than that of all Fe species in such explosions.\n\nWhile detailed nebular spectrum calculations are needed to infer the\nnickel and iron abundances, the detection of strong [\\ion{Ni}{II}],\nespecially being much stronger than [\\ion{Fe}{II}], can be interpreted\nas strong evidence for a (nearly) $M_{\\rm Ch}$ progenitor star.\nAccordingly, this is further support for the deflagration models which\nfail to unbind their progenitor star.\n\nIf the progenitor stars at the time of explosion have masses of $1\n{\\rm M}_{\\sun} \\lesssim M \\lesssim M_{\\rm Ch}$, and in particular if\nthey are close to the Chandrasekhar mass, then the implied ejecta\nmasses of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 0.5~M$_{\\sun}$ (or less) for most SNe~Iax \\citep[see,\ne.g.,][]{Foley10:08ha, Foley13:iax, Narayan11, McCully14:iax} require\na bound remnant for nearly all SNe~Iax.\n\n\n\\subsection{Size of the Late-time Photosphere}\\label{ss:phot_size}\n\nAt late times ($t \\gtrsim 200$~d), some SNe~Iax still have permitted\nlines with P-Cygni features, indicative of persistent photospheres\n\\citepalias{Jha06:02cx}.  Although we cannot detect individual P-Cygni\nfeatures for some SNe~Iax, the continua of all SNe~Iax are similar.\nAdditionally, the bluer [\\ion{Fe}{II}] and [\\ion{Fe}{III}] features\nseen in late-time spectra of SNe~Ia are absent in all late-time SN~Iax\nspectra.  It is therefore likely that all SNe~Iax have a photosphere\nat late times.\n\nWe can measure the size of the photosphere in two independent ways.\nThe first is to measure the luminosity and temperature of a SN~Iax at\nlate times and determine the radius assuming that the emission comes\nfrom a blackbody.  The second is to assume that the velocity of the\nlate-time P-Cygni lines is characteristic of the velocity of the\nlate-time photosphere.  Assuming no acceleration, one can measure the\nradius knowing the time between explosion and the time of the\nspectrum.\n\nFor these measurements, we will emphasise the well-observed SN~2005hk\n\\citep{Phillips07, Sahu08, McCully14:iax}, focusing on the $+402$~d\nspectrum (417 days after explosion) presented by\n\\citet{Silverman12:bsnip}.  This is the last spectrum of SN~2005hk\nwhich still has a clear continuum.  At this time, the bolometric\nluminosity of SN~2005hk was {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} $10^{39.9}$~erg~s$^{-1}$\n\\citep{McCully14:iax}.  The bolometric luminosity was determined from\nbroad-band photometry, and may overestimate the continuum flux by as\nmuch as 40\\% because of line emission (as determined from the optical\nspectrum).  Fitting a blackbody spectrum to the continuum of SN~2005hk\nat this epoch, we find a best-fitting temperature of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 4500 --\n5500~K, consistent with the presence of both \\ion{Fe}{I} and\n\\ion{Fe}{II} in the spectrum \\citep{Hatano99:ion, McCully14:iax}.\nUsing the above values, we determine that the blackbody radius 417~d\nafter explosion is\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  R_{\\rm BB} = 1.3 \\times 10^{14} \\left ( \\frac{L}{10^{39.9}\n      {\\rm ~erg}} \\right )^{1/2} \\left ( \\frac{T}{5000 {\\rm ~K}} \\right\n  )^{-2} {\\rm ~cm}.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"R_{\\rm BB}=1.3\\times 10^{14}\\left(\\frac{L}{10^{39.9}{\\rm~{}erg}}\\right)^{1/2}%&#10;\\left(\\frac{T}{5000{\\rm~{}K}}\\right)^{-2}{\\rm~{}cm}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>BB</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>1.3</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>14</mn></msup></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>L</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>39.9</mn></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>erg</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>T</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>5000</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">K</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>cm</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05955.tex", "nexttext": "\na radius more than an order of magnitude {\\it higher} than the\nblackbody radius.  The uncertainty in this measurement is around 2\\%\nand primarily set by the uncertainty in the measured velocity.\n\nThese two discrepant estimates of the photospheric radius cannot be\nreconciled by any simple adjustment of the measured quantities.\nFirst, the late-time photospheric velocity would need to be\noverestimated such that the true velocity is $v_{\\rm ph} \\lesssim\n40$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}, which is much too low to be consistent with the spectrum.\nAlternatively, the bolometric luminosity could be {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n$10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, which is $>$2 orders of magnitude higher than\nmeasured.  Finally, a true temperature of 2500~K would sufficiently\nreduce the measured blackbody radius; however, at this temperature, we\nwould not expect to see any \\ion{Fe}{II} emission.  Furthermore, such\na low temperature would require that the continuum seen in the spectra\nbe caused by a nonblackbody component, making our luminosity\nassumption incorrect --- a lower blackbody luminosity with this lower\ntemperature is similarly inconsistent with the kinematic radius.  In\nsummary, it does not appear that a poor assumption or measurement\nerror has resulted in this discrepancy.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the different radius estimates is\nasymmetry, but this ultimately seems unlikely.  The kinematic radius\ndescribes the radius along the line of sight, while the blackbody\nradius describes the (average) radius in the plane of the sky.  A\nhighly asymmetric explosion could thus have very different\nmeasurements for the radius.  However, this would require an extreme\naspect ratio and very particular viewing angle.  This becomes even\nless likely considering the number of other SNe~Iax similar to\nSN~2005hk and the lack of strong polarization at early times for\nSN~2005hk \\citep{Chornock06, Maund10:05hk}.\n\nAlternatively, the photospheric material may not have been expanding\nsince the time of explosion.  If the material generating the\nphotosphere were launched at 410~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ 30--40~d before the time of the\nspectrum (with a shorter period if there is deceleration), this would\nplace the kinematic radius at the same radius as the blackbody radius.\nHowever, in this scenario, the material would not be caused by the\ninitial explosion and must be a wind from either the companion star or\na surviving remnant.\n\nIn the case of a wind, the velocity of the photosphere should be\nessentially the wind velocity; the SN explosion would have created a\ncavity and so there would be minimal deceleration.  (However, if there\nis a bound remnant, there may be infalling material even at late times\nwhich could decelerate the wind.)  Assuming that the photosphere seen\nat late times for SN~2005hk is the result of a 410~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ wind,\nequivalent to the escape speed of a compact remnant, this remnant\nwould have a radius at late times of\n\n\n\n\n$R = 8 \\times 10^{10} \\left ( M / 0.5 {\\rm M}_{\\sun} \\right ) {\\rm\n  ~cm} = 1.2 \\left ( M / 0.5 {\\rm M}_{\\sun} \\right ) {\\rm R}_{\\sun}$.\nFor this scenario, the mass-loss rate would need to be high enough\nsuch that the wind remains optically thick out to a radius of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n$10^{14}$~cm, or {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} $10^{3} {\\rm R}_{\\sun}$.\n\nThe velocity of the permitted lines seen in the SN~2005hk spectra\ndecreased by {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 100~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ between 245~d and 417~d after explosion,\ncorresponding to {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 0.5~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}~d$^{-1}$.  This incredibly slow\nchange in the photospheric velocity is also difficult to explain with\na single homologous expansion, thus favouring a wind interpretation.\n\n\\subsection{A Two-Component Ejecta Model}\n\nThe above radius estimates argue for a late-time wind from the\nprogenitor system.  Explosion models which match the early-time\nspectra and light curves of SNe~Iax also argue for a bound remnant\n\\citep{Jordan12, Kromer13, Kromer15}.  These models predict that a\nsignificant amount ({$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 0.02~M$_{\\sun}$) of $^{56}$Ni will remain\nin the remnant, providing an energy source that may be able to drive\ndynamical outflows.  It is reasonable to think that after a SN~Iax\nexplosion a bound remnant would expand to $R \\approx {\\rm R}_{\\sun}$\nand drive a super-Eddington wind (Bildsten et~al., in prep.).  This\nmodel also solves the problem of having low-velocity material from an\nexplosion that completely disrupted the star \\citep{McCully14:iax}.\n\nHowever, for our observations, we do not require that the wind comes\nfrom a bound remnant.  Rather, the wind could be caused by the remnant\nor the companion star.  While it is not yet possible to distinguish\nbetween these two possibilities, the significant $^{56}$Ni in the\nbound remnant would be a natural energy source to drive such a wind.\n\nIn the wind scenario, the photosphere is significantly smaller than\nthe forbidden-line emitting region, which is likely dominated by SN\nejecta.  For the case of SN~2005hk, assuming that nearly all of the\nluminosity comes from the photosphere at late times, the photosphere\nwas at $R \\approx 10^{14}$~cm at +402~d, while the forbidden-line\nemitting region should be at\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 61374, "prevtext": "\nThe uncertainty in the radius measurement is {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 20\\% given the\nuncertainties in the luminosity and temperature, and the range in\nradius is the result of different assumptions about the continuum\nluminosity and blackbody temperature.\n\nThe $+402$~d spectrum of SN~2005hk has a photospheric velocity (as\ndetermined from the P-Cygni absorption) of $-410$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}, similar to\nwhat was found for SN~2002cx at late times \\citep{Jha06:02cx}.

Similarly, the lack of broad Ca lines may be\nindicative of different compositions for the broad and narrow\ncomponents.

However, strong [\\ion{O}{I}] has not yet been observed\nin a SN~Iax (\\citetalias{Jha06:02cx}; \\citealt{McCully14:iax}), and\nsince both [\\ion{Ca}{II}] and \\ion{Ca}{II} are seen in the spectra,\nthe density is sufficiently high to suppress [\\ion{O}{I}] emission\n\\citep{McCully14:iax}.  None the less, this potential compositional\ndifference may explain the lack of broad [\\ion{Ca}{II}] lines.  The\n\\citet{Kromer13} model has 9.7 and 220 times as much (by mass) IGEs as\nCa in the remnant and SN ejecta, respectively.  This difference is\ngenerally consistent with having relatively strong/absent narrow/broad\nCa lines.\n\nIf the narrow forbidden lines are indicative of a wind, then nearly\nevery SN~Iax must have such a wind.  With the possible exception of\nSN~2011ay, which does not have an obviously distinct low-velocity\ncomponent, all SNe~Iax in our sample have some narrow lines.\n\nThere is significant diversity in the strength, width, and velocity\nshifts of the broad component of the forbidden lines.  These\nproperties are strongly correlated with maximum-light properties such\nas peak luminosity, but uncorrelated (or weakly correlated) with the\nnarrow forbidden lines, indicating two distinct kinematic components.\n\nIn the wind model, the narrow forbidden lines, the low-velocity\nP-Cygni lines, and the photosphere would be generated by a wind, while\nthe broad forbidden lines would be related to the SN ejecta, and thus\nto early-time SN properties.\n\n\\citet{Kromer13} modeled SN~2005hk with such a two-component model and\nwere able to separate the SN luminosity from the luminosity of the\nbound remnant.  In this model, the ejecta of SN~2005hk should have a\nluminosity of roughly $10^{39.3}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ at the time of the\nlate-time spectrum analyzed above (time since explosion of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n417~d).  This is roughly 20\\% of the total bolometric luminosity.\nExamining the SN~2005hk spectra, we find that the broad forbidden\nlines discussed in this work represent {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 5\\% of the optical\nluminosity.  For the SN~2012Z spectrum analyzed above, which had the\nstrongest broad absorption lines of our sample, the broad forbidden\nlines represent {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 45\\% of the total optical luminosity at late\ntimes.  Therefore, the broad forbidden lines, which one would\nnaturally associate with the SN emission, have roughly the predicted\nfractional flux of the SN ejecta in the \\citet{Kromer13} model.\n\nIn this two-component ejecta model, where one component is from the SN\nexplosion and the other is from the wind, there is not necessarily any\ndirect physical connection between the two components.  That is, the\namount of $^{56}$Ni left in the remnant and the mass of the remnant,\nwhich must be the primary variables for the strength of the wind and\nits velocity, may be essentially unrelated to the amount of $^{56}$Ni\nejected and the ejecta mass, which are likely the primary variables\nfor SN properties.  While a ``stronger'' explosion is expected to\nproduce more $^{56}$Ni, it is unclear what percentage of the\nprogenitor star is burned, what the initial mass of the progenitor\nstar is, or what fraction of $^{56}$Ni is ejected relative to that\nleft in the remnant.\n\n\\citet{Kromer15} produced a model explosion that roughly matches the\nobserved properties of SN~2008ha \\citep{Foley09:08ha, Foley10:08ha,\n  Valenti09}, the least-luminous SN~Iax yet discovered.  While the\n\\citet{Kromer13} model used a C/O WD progenitor, the \\citet{Kromer15}\nmodel used a hybrid C/O-Ne WD.  The composition of the WD accounts for\nthe different outcomes; however, the exact ignition conditions could\naffect the mass burned in the deflagration.  While SN~2008ha was not\ndetected at late times \\citep{Foley10:08ha}, this model may provide\ninsight into the diversity of ejecta for SNe~Iax having different\nluminosities. In this model, 46\\% of the ejecta is composed of IGEs,\nlower than for the \\citet{Kromer13} SN~Iax model, indicating a\npossible compositional difference for low- and high-luminosity\nSNe~Iax.\n\nUsing these two models as examples, there is a trend between peak\nluminosity and ejecta mass.  The \\citet{Kromer13} and \\citet{Kromer15}\nmodels have peak $V$-band absolute magnitudes of $-18.2$ and $-14.8$,\nrespectively (and a factor of 23 in luminosity), while they also\nproduce 0.372 and 0.014~M$_{\\sun}$ of ejecta, respectively (a factor\nof 27).  Based on these models, one may expect that peak luminosity is\nrelated to the relative strength of the broad forbidden-line emission,\nwhich would have some dependence on ejecta mass.\n\nTo examine this possibility, Figure~\\ref{f:mv_niew} displays the\ncorrelation between $M_{V, {\\rm ~peak}}$ and broad-component\n[\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$ EW.  There is a modest correlation\n(correlation coefficient of $-0.53$), where more-luminous SNe~Iax tend\nto have stronger broad emission lines.  However, there is no\ncorrelation between the narrow-component [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$\nEW and peak luminosity ($r = -0.15$), consistent with a wind that is\nrelatively independent of the SN ejecta.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{mv_niew}\n  \\caption{Peak absolute $V$ magnitude as a function of the\n    broad-component [\\ion{Ni}{II}] $\\lambda 7378$ EW.  The correlation\n    coefficient is $-0.53$.}\\label{f:mv_niew}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{An Asymmetric Explosion?}\n\nThe two-component model described above is insufficient for\nreproducing the correlation between peak luminosity and velocity\nshifts of the broad forbidden-line emitting region (i.e.,\nFigure~\\ref{f:broadmv}).  That model also does not explain the\npredominantly blueshifted broad forbidden lines regardless of any\ncorrelation with peak luminosity.\n\nThe latter is difficult to explain with a simple two-component model.\nFor a predominantly blueshifted population, one would expect that the\nredshifted emission be blocked by a photosphere.  However, above we\nfound that the broad forbidden-line emitting region is {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 10,000\ntimes larger than the photosphere (in projection) at {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 417~d\nafter explosion.  Even for the typical phases of the spectra analyzed\nin this work, the broad forbidden-line emitting region is likely\n{$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 3000 times larger than the photosphere.  In this scenario, the\nphotosphere would be unable to block most of the redshifted emission.\n\nIf we require a photosphere to block the redshifted emission of the\nbroad forbidden-line emitting region, it should have a projected area\n$\\lesssim$10$\\times$ that of the area of the photosphere.  One\nscenario is that the SNe with blueshifted forbidden lines also have\nmuch larger photospheres ($\\gtrsim 2 \\times 10^{15}$~cm) than that of\nSN~2005hk.  This photosphere, if at {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 5000~K, would have a large\nluminosity of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} $10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$.  This is much larger than\nany SN~Iax measured at late times \\citep[e.g.,][]{McCully14:iax} and\nnot significantly less than the peak SN luminosity.\n\nAlternatively, the broad emission, which should come from the SN\nejecta, may not be distributed symmetrically.  In fact, reasonable\nexplosion models expect few plumes, which could result in highly\nasymmetric ejecta \\citep{Jordan12, Kromer13}.  If, for instance, there\nis higher-velocity material ejected primarily along a single axis,\nthen when we see a large velocity, corresponding to a line of sight\nalong this axis, a smaller photosphere could block the redshifted\nemission.  Correspondingly, looking perpendicular to this axis would\nresult in no broad lines.  This is an intriguing model to describe the\ndiversity of SN~Iax late-time spectra, including the transition\nobjects, which would be viewed at an angle intermediate to the two\nexamples mentioned above.\n\nA downside of this model is that one would predict extremely large\nasymmetries in the SN ejecta and thus large polarization, which is\ninconsistent with measurements made for a single SN~Iax, SN~2005hk\n\\citep{Chornock06, Maund10:05hk}.  However, the photosphere at the\ntimes of polarization measurements might not have been dominated by\nthis asymmetric material or SN~2005hk may be an atypical object.  In\nfact, it may be the case that the blueshifted objects come from a\nsubpopulation that have strong asymmetries, while other SN~Iax\nexplosions are more spherical.  Additional spectropolarimetric\nobservations of SNe~Iax, and comparisons to other spectral and\nphotometric properties, will test this possibility.\n\n\\subsection{The ``Late-time'' SN~2008ha Spectra}\n\nSN~2008ha is an exceptional SN~Iax, being the least luminous member of\nthe class \\citep[$M_{V, {\\rm peak}} = -14.2$~mag;][]{Foley09:08ha,\n  Valenti09}, fading very quickly \\citep[$\\Delta m_{15}(B) =\n2.2$~mag;][]{Foley09:08ha}, and having very low-velocity ejecta at\npeak brightness \\citep[$v_{\\rm ph} = -3700$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$};][]{Foley10:08ha}.\nCombined, the data suggest that the SN ejected $M \\lesssim\n0.3$~M$_{\\sun}$ \\citep{Foley10:08ha}, significantly less than that\nexpected for a WD SN that completely unbinds its star.  Intriguingly,\nat $t \\approx +4$~yr, there is a very red star detected in {\\it HST}\nimages coincident with the position of SN~2008ha \\citep{Foley14:08ha}.\nWhile this may be a chance coincidence, it is also possibly the\nsurviving remnant of the WD.\n\nFor all of these reasons, SN~2008ha appears to be an extremely\ninteresting object for testing the wind model.  Unfortunately, the\nonly late-time spectrum of SN~2008ha, at $t = +231$~d, did not reveal\nany SN emission \\citep{Foley10:08ha}.  Therefore, the latest\nspectroscopic data for SN~2008ha extend to only {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 2~months after\npeak \\citep{Foley09:08ha, Valenti09}.  However, even at these early\ntimes, the spectrum exhibited strong [\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission\n\\citep{Foley09:08ha, Valenti09}.\n\nFor the first time here, we note that for phases of $t \\gtrsim +37$~d,\nthe spectra of SN~2008ha look remarkably similar to those of other\nSNe~Iax at $t > 200$~d.  Specifically, SN~2008ha has emission from\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}], [\\ion{Fe}{II}], and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] starting around a\nmonth after peak brightness.  We detect this emission in the +37~d\nspectrum, but it is absent in the +22~d spectrum.\n\n\nWe compare the +37~d and +63~d spectra of SN~2008ha to the +227~d\nspectrum of SN~2002cx in Figure~\\ref{f:08ha}.  The continua and\npermitted lines in the spectra of the two SNe are nearly identical.\nThe primary difference is the strength of the forbidden lines.  At\n+37~d, SN~2008ha has relatively stronger [\\ion{Ca}{II}] and weaker\n[\\ion{Fe}{II}] and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] than SN~2002cx.  However, at +63~d,\nSN~2008ha has [\\ion{Ca}{II}] emission that is roughly 10 times as\nstrong as for SN~2002cx (relative to the continuum emission).  At this\ntime, the [\\ion{Fe}{II}] and [\\ion{Ni}{II}] emission is similar in the\ntwo objects (again, relative to the continuum).\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2008ha}\n  \\caption{Optical spectra of SN~2008ha (black curves; top panel is at\n    $t = +37$~d; bottom panel is at $t = +63$~d) and SN~2002cx (blue\n    curves; $t = +227$~d).  The spectra are remarkably similar despite\n    their very different phases.}\\label{f:08ha}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFrom spectra alone, it appears that SN~2008ha has a ``late-time''\nappearance starting only {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 1~month after peak.  This is\nexceptionally fast evolution.  If our wind model is correct, we would\nexpect the wind to be launched before {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 50~d after explosion\n(since SN~2008ha had a rise time of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 10~d), placing a strong\nlower limit to this condition in at least the lowest-luminosity\nSNe~Iax.  Regardless, it appears that SN~2008ha transitioned to have\n``late-time'' behaviour at an incredibly early time.\n\nThe \\citet{Kromer15} model for SN~2008ha resulted in six times as much\n$^{56}$Ni in the bound remnant than in the SN ejecta.  As a result,\nthe instantaneous energy deposition is always larger for the remnant\nthan in the ejecta.  Depending on the distribution of $^{56}$Ni in the\nremnant, one could imagine the wind being the dominant component at\nthese early times.\n\nWe also examined the spectra of SN~2010ae, another low-luminosity,\nlow-velocity SN~Iax \\citep{Stritzinger14:10ae}.  Despite the other\nsimilarities to SN~2008ha, SN~2010ae does not exhibit any forbidden\nemission through +57~d.  There are no published spectra of SN~2010ae\nbetween +57~d and +252~d (we examine this late-time spectrum above);\ntherefore, we cannot assess if SN~2010ae transitioned to having a\n``late-time'' spectrum at a relatively early time.  None the less, we\ncan definitively say that this transition happened later in SN~2010ae\nthan in SN~2008ha.\n\nFinally, while the $>$1~month SN~2008ha spectra are extremely similar\nto those of SNe~Iax at $>$6~months, we have chosen to not include\nthese spectra in the other analysis presented here so as to examine\nonly SNe~Iax at late times rather than select objects based solely on\nspectral similarities.\n\n\\subsection{Lack of Dust in SN~2014dt}\n\n\\citet{Fox15} detected SN~2014dt as a relatively strong IR source at\nphases of +302 to +329~d after peak brightness.  The IR flux was\ninterpreted as dust emission either from pre-existing circumstellar\ndust or dust newly formed in the SN ejecta.  Fitting the two IR bands,\nthey infer a dust mass of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} $5 \\times 10^{-6}$~M$_{\\sun}$ (using\nour preferred distance) and a blackbody temperature of 700~K.\n\\citet{Fox15} measure an increase in IR luminosity during this month\nof observations, and while this is only significant at {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n1~$\\sigma$, it may be indicative of an increasing luminosity of an\nIR-bright component to SN~2014dt.\n\nAs noted by \\citet{Foley15:14dt} and \\citet{Fox15}, there is no\nindication of dust reddening for SN~2014dt at early times.\n\\citet{Fox15} notes that SN~2014dt becomes redder (in $B-V$) at {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n250~d after peak.  This claim is based on a single data point that is\ndiscrepant from other SN~Iax colour curves at {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 3~$\\sigma$.\nHowever, there is some indication of SN~2014dt becoming redder at\nthese times in our late-time spectra.  \\citet{Fox15} interpret the\nchange in colour as coming from additional flux of a redder component\nand not new dust reddening.  Using the light-curve data presented by\n\\citet{Fox15}, including the extrapolated optical light curves, we\nfind that based on the IR luminosity, a 2000~K blackbody can\ncontribute at most 0.3\\% of the $V$-band flux, with lower temperatures\ncontributing even less flux.  Therefore, it is unlikely that a single\nblackbody can both account for the IR flux and change the $B-V$\ncolour.\n\nGiven the low reddening at early times, it is unlikely that there was\nany significant amount of pre-existing circumstellar dust.  There are\nalso strong limits on narrow absorption lines in the spectra of\nSN~2014dt \\citep{Foley15:14dt}, indicating a gas-poor circumstellar\nenvironment.  Furthermore, there is no indication of any circumstellar\ninteraction in any spectra (Figure~\\ref{f:14dt_spec}), including the\n+410-day spectrum (Figure~\\ref{f:14dt_dust}).  The circumstellar dust\nscenario seems unlikely given existing data.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2014dt_spec_dust}\n  \\caption{Late-time spectra of SN~2005hk at phases of roughly\n    $+270$~d (black curve) and $+410$~d (blue curve).  The spectra are\n    very similar.  The slight difference in continuum shape is\n    inconsistent with dust reddening, but is consistent with slightly\n    different photospheric temperatures.  There is no indication for\n    circumstellar interaction in either spectrum.  {\\it Inset}:\n    Zoom-in of the region near the forbidden emission lines.  There is\n    no indication of preferential extinction for the red side of the\n    forbidden-line profiles.}\\label{f:14dt_dust}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe can also test the possibility of newly formed dust with data\npresented here.  Dust can form in the SN ejecta, and this will redden\nthe SN, produce an IR excess, and preferentially extinguish the\nredshifted light in forbidden lines \\citep[e.g.,][]{Smith08:06jc}.\nWith our +410-day spectrum of SN~2014dt, which was obtained after the\nIR data, we can rule out any significant newly formed dust.\n\nMost obviously, there are no clear changes to the forbidden-line\nshapes.  Figure~\\ref{f:14dt_dust} displays the late-time spectra of\nSN~2014dt from +270~d and +410~d.  While there is a slight change in\nthe strength of the [\\ion{Ni}{II}] emission (see\nSection~\\ref{ss:evol}), the forbidden lines are otherwise nearly\nidentical in strength, width, velocity shift, and profile.  In\nparticular, there is no preferential extinction of redshifted\nmaterial.  This is consistent for all spectra of SN~2014dt, including\nthe +410~d spectrum, which was taken after the IR observations.\n\nAdditionally, there is no obvious emission from a warm, {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 2000~K\n(corresponding to the dust deposition temperature) blackbody (see\nFigure~\\ref{f:14dt_spec}) as was seen for the dust-forming SN~2006jc\n\\citep{Smith08:06jc}.  However, given the IR luminosity, such a\ncomponent is not necessarily expected.  None the less, this is further\nindication that the change in $B-V$ colour is intrinsic to the SN and\nnot a result of an additional blackbody component.\n\nExamining the wavelength regions near hydrogen Balmer, \\ion{He}{I},\nand \\ion{He}{II} lines, we see no indication of narrow emission as\nwould be expected from circumstellar interaction.  While this does not\nrule out the presence of circumstellar material, it does constrain the\namount of such matter and the mechanism for heating potential\ncircumstellar dust.\n\nFinally, there is no indication of additional reddening.  While the\ncontinuum of SN~2014dt has slowly become redder with time, we are\nunable to deredden later spectra to match earlier spectra using normal\nreddening laws and reasonable reddening parameters.  While one can\nderedden later spectra to roughly match the continuum at either bluer\nor redder wavelengths, it is not possible to adequately match all\nwavelengths simultaneously.  Moreover, such a manipulation changes the\nstrengths of the spectral features.  While all observed spectra have\nroughly similar line strengths from +172 to +410~d, dereddening\nspectra causes bluer lines to become relatively stronger and redder\nlines to become relatively weaker.  For the SN to have additional\nreddening, it must be a particularly odd reddening law and the SN\nspectral features must evolve in a way to perfectly counteract the\neffects of reddening.  We find this behaviour to be highly unlikely.\n\nAn alternative explanation for the IR emission in SN~2014dt, which was\nnot explored by \\citet{Fox15}, is that it comes from a bound remnant\nwith a super-Eddington wind.  Such a mechanism is consistent with the\nSN~2014dt data, late-time data for all SNe~Iax, and the potential\ncounterpart seen for SN~2008ha \\citep{Foley14:08ha}.  Considering the\nlack of any obvious circumstellar material or dust, as well as the\nobserved long-lasting photosphere and low photospheric velocities, the\nbest model for the IR emission is that it is somehow related to the\nbound remnant, and most likely as an optically thick super-Eddington\nwind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\\label{s:conc}\n\nWe have presented an analysis of the late-time spectra of a sample of\n10 SNe~Iax.  We add 8 spectra of SN~2014dt, the closest SN~Iax yet\ndiscovered, to literature data to form our dataset.  We find that\nwhile there are some subtle changes to the spectra at $t \\gtrsim\n200$~d after peak brightness, a single late-time spectrum is generally\nsufficient to describe the late-time behaviour of a SN~Iax.  In\nparticular, we find SNe~Iax to be in a continuum between two extremes:\n(1) those having low-velocity ({$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 500~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}) permitted P-Cygni\nlines and strong/narrow forbidden [\\ion{Fe}{II}], [\\ion{Ni}{II}], and\n[\\ion{Ca}{II}], and weak (or absent)/broad [\\ion{Fe}{II}] and\n[\\ion{Ni}{II}]; and (2) those having relatively smooth continuum\nemission with a shape similar to that of other SNe~Iax, relatively\nweak (perhaps even absent in one case)/narrow forbidden\n[\\ion{Fe}{II}], [\\ion{Ni}{II}], and [\\ion{Ca}{II}], and strong/broad\n[\\ion{Fe}{II}] and [\\ion{Ni}{II}].\n\nBy fitting the forbidden lines, cross-correlating the spectra, and\nperforming a PCA, we have quantitatively shown that the spectral\ncontinuum described above is real, with the various correlated\nproperties listed being significant.  We further note that besides the\nrelative strength of the narrow/broad forbidden lines, the two\nkinematic components appear to be physically disconnected.  That is,\nthe velocity shifts and widths of the broad and narrow components are\nuncorrelated.\n\nWe find a strong correlation between the width/strength of the broad\nforbidden lines and their blueshift.  We also find no SNe~Iax that\nhave clearly redshifted broad forbidden lines, while there are several\nthat are significantly blueshifted.  It is unclear if this trend is\nsimply a result of a relatively small sample.\n\nWe find that SNe~Iax that have higher ejecta velocities measured at\nmaximum brightness also have stronger broad forbidden lines.  This can\nbe explained if explosions with higher kinetic energy per unit mass\nalso eject more material.  We also find that the more luminous (at\npeak) SNe~Iax have stronger, broader, and more blueshifted broad\nforbidden lines.  This requires that either SNe~Iax that produce more\n$^{56}$Ni (in their ejecta) also have higher-velocity ejecta, or that\nSNe~Iax are highly asymmetric and lines of sight that see\nhigher-velocity ejecta are also more luminous.  Such claims can be\ntested in the future with additional spectropolarimetry of SNe~Iax.\n\nThe strong [\\ion{Ni}{II}] lines in SN~Iax spectra at $>$200~d after\nexplosion must come from stable Ni, presumably $^{58}$Ni.  Producing\nsuch a large amount of stable Ni requires electron capture, which can\nonly occur at the high densities of a (nearly) $M_{\\rm Ch}$ WD.\nAlthough full nebular modeling is necessary to confirm the Ni (and Fe)\nabundances, this is further support for the idea that deflagrations of\n(nearly) $M_{\\rm Ch}$ WDs that fail to unbind their stars produce\nSNe~Iax \\citep{Jordan12, Kromer13, Kromer15}.\n\nWe found that the kinematic radius of SN~2005hk (determined from the\nvelocity of the photosphere at late times and the time since\nexplosion) is an order of magnitude higher than the blackbody radius\n(determined from the luminosity and temperature).  This discrepancy\nalong with others point to SN~2005hk and several other SNe~Iax --- and\nperhaps all SNe~Iax --- to have a wind component at late times.  A\ntwo-component model consisting of the SN ejecta and a wind, either\ndriven from a remnant or companion, solves the radius problem, the\nslow decline of the late-time light curve, the lack of velocity\nevolution of the photosphere from about 200~d to $>$400~d after peak\nbrightness, and the fact that SNe~Iax have a photosphere even at\nextremely late times.\n\nFor the two-component model, the photosphere, P-Cygni features, and\nnarrow forbidden lines are caused by the wind while the broad\nforbidden lines are from the SN ejecta.  In this case, the two\ncomponents would be relatively decoupled.  However, the details of the\nprogenitor and explosion likely affect both the SN ejecta (through the\namount of $^{56}$Ni generated, the ejecta mass, the ejecta velocity,\nand the ejecta composition) and the wind (through the amount of\n$^{56}$Ni trapped in the remnant, the mass of the remnant, and the\ncomposition of the remnant).  Such a model may have compositional\ndifferences, which can be tested with detailed modeling.\n\nWe consider if SNe~Iax are primarily asymmetric explosions.  While not\nfully explored in current SN~Iax models \\citep{Jordan12, Kromer13,\n  Kromer15}, it is possible that the explosion is highly asymmetric.\nHowever, the current spectroscopic data for a single SN~Iax disfavour\nlarge asymmetries \\citep{Chornock06, Maund10:05hk}.  Although such\nextreme asymmetries currently seem unlikely, additional data will test\nif SN~Iax explosions are generally symmetric.\n\nWe found that the low-luminosity SN~2008ha had a spectrum similar to\nthe $\\gtrsim$200~d spectra of other SNe~Iax only {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 1~month after\npeak brightness.  As SN~2008ha likely did not unbind its progenitor\nstar \\citep{Foley09:08ha, Foley10:08ha, Foley13:iax, Foley14:08ha}, it\nis an excellent candidate for having a bound remnant and wind.  This\nearly transition to a ``wind-dominant'' spectrum can possibly be\nexplained by the relative amounts of $^{56}$Ni in the remnant and\nejecta \\citep{Kromer15}.  Detailed spectral sequences, especially for\nlow-luminosity events are necessary to determine if the timing of this\ntransition is related to the explosion energetics.\n\nFinally, we examined the spectra of SN~2014dt in detail, focusing on\nthe possibility of there being dust and/or circumstellar material\n\\citep[as suggested by][]{Fox15}.  We find no evidence for newly\nformed or circumstellar dust, or any other circumstellar material, and\nthe existing data disfavour dust emission as the source of the IR\nflux.  As an alternative, the strong IR flux seen about 315~d after\npeak is perhaps caused by an extended optically thick super-Eddington\nwind.  Such a scenario is consistent with all existing data.  If this\nemission is dominated by the remnant, it may be the second such\ndetection after SN~2008ha \\citep{Foley14:08ha}.\n\nLate-time spectra of future SNe~Iax will continue to constrain their\nprogenitors and explosions.  Such data are critical for understanding\nthe potential remnant star and the properties of a possible\nremnant-blown wind.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\n\n\n  {\\it Facility:} SOAR (Goodman), Keck:I (LRIS), Shane (Kast Double\n  spectrograph), SALT (RSS)\n\n\\bigskip\n\nR.J.F.\\ gratefully acknowledges support from NSF grant AST-1518052 and\nthe Alfred P.\\ Sloan Foundation.

They then compared their spectra to those of previously\nclassified SNe using {\\tt superfit} \\citep{Howell05}, allowing the\nredshift to vary by $\\pm$0.02.  If one of the top 15 spectral matches\nwas a SN~Iax or SN~2002es, it was investigated further.  After\nsmoothing the spectrum, they measured the number of ``peaks'' seen in\nthe spectrum between 6000 and 8000~\\AA.  SNe with a large number of\nmeasured peaks were retained in the sample; however, the exact number\nnecessary for inclusion in the final sample is not mentioned and some\nspectra do not cover this full spectral range.  SNe that then have a\nstrong \\ion{Ti}{II} $\\lambda 4200$ line are considered SN~2002es-like\n(although one SN in their sample does not definitely have this\nfeature), while those lacking this line and having a ``peak'' near\n6200~\\AA\\ are considered SNe~Iax.  In total, \\citet{White15} presented\nsix new SNe classified as Type Iax and three new SNe classified as\nSN~2002es-like.\n\n\\citet{White15} also re-evaluated literature SNe to determine if they\nwere SNe~Iax and/or SN~2002es.  Their main conclusion from this\nadditional investigation is that SNe~2004cs and 2007J, which have\nprominent \\ion{He}{I} lines in their spectra but are otherwise very\nsimilar to other SNe~Iax \\citep{Foley09:08ha, Foley13:iax}, should be\nclassified as SNe~IIb instead of SNe~Iax.\n\nAs part of our study of late-time spectra of SNe~Iax, we examined the\n\\citet{White15} sample to determine if any members should be included\nin the current study.  While only one SN in their sample (PTF09ego)\nhas a spectrum at $>200$~d after peak brightness, we examined the\nentire sample for completeness.  Through this analysis, we found that\nfour SNe are likely SNe~Iax and two SNe are probably SN~2002es-like\nSNe.  However, we show below that two SNe were misclassified and that\none SN has insufficient data for a clear classification.  Below we\nexamine these misclassified and ambiguous SNe in detail.\n\nAdditionally, we re-evaluate the claim that SNe~2004cs and 2007J are\nSNe~IIb.  There is no strong evidence that SNe~2004cs and 2007J are\nSNe~IIb, but significant evidence against this claim.  In addition to\nother data, there is no evidence for hydrogen emission, arguing\nagainst the ``Type II'' designation.  While it is still unclear if\nSNe~2004cs and 2007J are physically linked to SNe~Iax (as discussed by\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax}), they do not appear to be SNe~IIb.\n\n\\subsection{PTF09ego}\n\nPTF09ego was discovered with PTF imaging and reported by\n\\citet{White15}; however, no discovery information is explicitly\nlisted.  Using two spectra, obtained on 23 September 2009 (at +13~d)\nand 15 May 2010 (at +225~d), \\citet{White15} classified PTF09ego as a\nSN~Iax.\n\nWe retrieved these spectra from WISERep \\citep{Yaron12}.  The later\nspectrum, although noisy, is consistent with being primarily or all\ngalaxy light.  Therefore, it cannot be included in the current study.\nFurthermore, the early-time spectrum, while similar to that of\nSN~2002cx (see Figure~\\ref{f:09ego}), is equally similar to that of\nthe high-luminosity SN~2009dc \\citep[e.g.,][]{Silverman11:09dc,\n  Taubenberger11}, sometimes referred to as a ``super-Chandrasekhar''\nSN~Ia.  While the peak luminosity of PTF09ego reported by\n\\citet[$M_{R} = -18.6$~mag]{White15} is more consistent with being a\nSN~Iax, their reported rise time of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 21~d is significantly\nlonger than that of any other SN~Iax ($t_{\\rm rise} \\approx 15$~d) and\nmore consistent with SN~2009dc \\citep[$t_{\\rm rise} \\approx 23$~d;\ne.g.,][]{Silverman11:09dc}.  Similarly, its relatively slow decline\nrate is similar to that of SN~2009dc and related objects.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{ptf09ego}\n  \\caption{Optical spectrum of PTF09ego (black curve) as presented by\n    \\citet{White15}.  Also shown are spectra of the SN~Iax~2002cx\n    \\citep[blue curve;][]{Li03:02cx} and the luminous SN~Ia~2009dc\n    \\citep[red curve;][]{Taubenberger11} at phases of $+20$ and\n    $+31$~d, respectively.  The spectra of SNe~2002cx and 2009dc have\n    had a galaxy template spectrum added to roughly match the\n    continuum seen in the spectrum of PTF09ego.}\\label{f:09ego}\n\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAlthough PTF09ego may be a SN~Iax, an alternative explanation is that\nit is similar to SN~2009dc with significant host-galaxy dust\nreddening.  We therefore consider PTF09ego to have an ambiguous\nclassification.  Regardless, its low-S/N late-time spectrum is not of\nadequate quality to be included in the current study.\n\n\\subsection{PTF09eiy}\n\nPTF09eiy was discovered with PTF imaging and reported by\n\\citet{White15}; however, no discovery information is explicitly\nlisted.  They present five spectra of the SN with phases of roughly\n(the time of maximum brightness is not well measured) +14, +33, +63,\n+100, and +121~d.  We present the three spectra having relatively high\nS/N in Figure~\\ref{f:09eiy}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{ptf09eiy}\n  \\caption{Optical spectra of PTF09eiy (black curve) as presented by\n    \\citet{White15}.  Also shown are spectra of the SN~Iax~2002cx\n    \\citep[blue curve;][]{Li03:02cx}, the SN~Iax~2008ge\n    \\citep{Foley10:08ge}, and the luminous SN~Ia~2009dc \\citep[red\n    curve;][]{Silverman11:09dc, Taubenberger11}.  The SN~2009dc\n    spectra have been reddened by $E(B-V) = 0.45$~mag (corresponding\n    to $A_{V} = 1.4$~mag).}\\label{f:09eiy}\n\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\citet{White15} classify this SN as a SN~Iax despite having high\nvelocities ($-9600$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}) in their first spectrum.  This spectrum\ndiffers from every other SN~Iax spectrum in the\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax} and \\citet{White15}\nsamples\\footnote{\\citet{White15} state that SN~2003gq, a SN~Iax in the\n  \\citetalias{Foley13:iax} sample, has a velocity of about\n  $-10$,000~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ a week before maximum brightness.  However,\n  \\citetalias{Foley13:iax} used this spectrum to measure a velocity of\n  $-5600$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}, which we verified during the present analysis.}.  The\nclassification appears to be mostly based on the later spectra, which\nare similar to spectra of SNe~Iax at comparable phases (assuming that\nthe SN was discovered near peak) and with the assumed redshift of\n0.06.\n\nExamining the PTF09eiy spectra in detail, we find that the later\nspectra are similar to those of other SNe~Iax.  However, the first\nspectrum is very different from any other SN~Iax.  This first spectrum\nis similar to those of typical SNe~Ia at similar phases, but the later\nspectra are unlike any spectra of typical SNe~Ia.\n\nAn alternative scenario is that PTF09eiy is not a SN~Iax, but rather\nan atypical SN~Ia similar to the high-luminosity SN~Ia SN~2009dc\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Silverman11:09dc, Taubenberger11}.\nFigure~\\ref{f:09eiy} presents spectral comparisons between PTF09eiy\nand both SNe~Iax and SN~2009dc at similar phases.  For this\ncomparison, SN~2009dc has been artificially extinguished by $A_{V} =\n1.4$~mag, corresponding to a reddening of $E(B-V) = 0.45$~mag.  After\napplying this reddening, SN~2009dc is similar to PTF09eiy at all\nphases.\n\nAccording to \\citet{White15}, PTF09eiy peaked at $M_{R} < -18.0$~mag.\nIf we correct for an extinction of $A_{V} = 1.4$~mag, this corresponds\nto $M_{R} < -19.1$~mag; however, SN~2009dc may itself have $A_{V}\n\\approx 0.9$~mag \\citep{Silverman11:09dc}, for which we did not\ncorrect in the spectral comparisons.  Adopting this additional\nextinction, PTF09eiy peaked at $M_{R} < -20.0$~mag, significantly\nbrighter than most SNe~Ia.\n\nGiven the spectral similarity at all available epochs as well as\nconsistent luminosities, we believe PTF09eiy is more likely to be\nsimilar to SN~2009dc than an atypical SN~Iax.\n\n\n\\subsection{PTF10bvr}\n\nPTF10bvr was discovered with PTF imaging and reported by\n\\citet{White15}; however, no discovery information is explicitly\nlisted.  Using a spectrum obtained 7.64 March 2010 (PI Kulkarni;\nProgram C247LA) with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\n\\citep[LRIS;][]{Oke95}, they classify PTF10bvr as a SN~2002es-like SN\nat $z = 0.015$.  SN~2002es is a peculiar Type I SN similar to\nSN~1991bg in many regards, but having significantly lower ejecta\nvelocity \\citep{Ganeshalingam12}.  Because of their low expansion\nvelocities, SNe~2002es-like objects may be physically related to\nSNe~Iax.\n\nWhile the nominal host galaxy of PTF10bvr, CGCG~224-067, is an\nearly-type galaxy at $z = 0.02954$, \\citet{White15} claim to detect a\nstrong Na~D absorption line at $z = 0.015$ and use that redshift to\nclassify the SN as having low velocities.  There is no other possible\nhost galaxy detected in any images presented by \\citet{White15},\nalthough presumably it would need to have a low luminosity in order to\nbe closer than CGCG~224-067 yet remain undetected.\n\nWe obtained the LRIS data from the Keck Observatory Archive and\nrereduced the data using our own data-reduction pipeline.  Standard\nCCD processing and spectrum extraction were accomplished with IRAF.\nThe data were extracted using the optimal algorithm of\n\\citet{Horne86}.  Low-order polynomial fits to calibration-lamp\nspectra were used to establish the wavelength scale, and small\nadjustments derived from night-sky lines in the object frames were\napplied.  We employed our own IDL routines to flux calibrate the data\nand remove telluric lines using the well-exposed continua of\nspectrophotometric standards \\citep{Wade88, Foley03,\n  Silverman12:bsnip}.\n\nThere were two standard-star observations obtained during the night:\nG191B2B and BD+33$^\\circ$2642.  We used the former and latter to\ncalibrate the blue and red data, respectively.  However, BD+33\\,2642\nis not an ideal standard as its absorption lines, particularly the\nPaschen series, make defining a continuum in regions of the spectrum\naffected by telluric absorption difficult.  We carefully removed these\nfeatures from our spectrum, but caution that the final result may\nstill have residual problems.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{ptf10bvr}\n  \\caption{Optical spectrum of PTF10bvr.  The black spectrum was\n    reduced by M.\\ Kasliwal and presented by \\citet{White15}.  The\n    blue spectrum is a rereduction of the same data by one of us\n    (R.J.F.).  We note that the \\citet{White15} version appears to\n    have been binned.  The red spectrum is a smoothed spectrum of\n    SN~2002fb, a SN~1991bg-like SN, at a phase of $+18$~d\n    \\citep{Silverman12:bsnip}, and shifted to be at the redshift of\n    CGCG 224-067, $z = 0.02954$.  The inset shows the region near the\n    claimed $z = 0.015$ Na~D absorption, which is only present in the\n    previous reduction and is likely an artifact.}\\label{f:10bvr}\n\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nBoth our reduction and the \\citet{White15} reduction of the spectrum\nare presented in Figure~\\ref{f:10bvr}.  Examining the two, it is clear\nthat the \\citet{White15} version suffers from several data-quality\nissues.  First, the wavelength solution near the dichroic (covering at\nleast (5500 -- 6150~\\AA) is incorrect by up to 40~\\AA.  Second, the\nflux beyond 9000~\\AA\\ is likely significantly underestimated; this was\nverified by independently reducing other spectra obtained during the\nnight.  The low flux at these wavelengths is perhaps partially caused\nby a lack of telluric correction, which is evident as the telluric ``A\nband'' near 7600~\\AA\\ is uncorrected.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=6.4in]{sn2007j}\n  \\caption{Optical spectra of SN~2007J (black curve).  The phase\n    ranges for the spectra are noted in each panel; the exact phase is\n    not known, but is constrained by a nondetection and the first\n    detection (see \\citealt{Foley09:08ha, Foley13:iax}).  The\n    left-side panels show the entire optical range, while the\n    right-side panels display in detail the area around H$\\alpha$.\n    There is no broad H$\\alpha$ from SN~2007J visible in any spectrum.\n    Comparison spectra of SN~Iax~2002cx and SN~IIb~1996cb are shown as\n    blue and red curves, respectively, with phases also noted.\n    SN~1996cb was specifically chosen as the SN~IIb with the weakest\n    H$\\alpha$ emission at late times (to match the lack of obvious\n    H$\\alpha$ in SN~2007J).  Regions corresponding to the strong\n    \\ion{He}{I} $\\lambda\\lambda$5876, 6678, 7065 lines are shaded\n    grey.}\\label{f:07j}\n\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWe further examine the claimed Na~D absorption.  This feature is\ncompletely absent in the new reduction.  Examining the two-dimensional\nimage, there is a cosmic ray near the position of the object at\nroughly the correct wavelength, although this is in a region where the\n\\citet{White15} wavelength calibration is highly suspect, so it is\ndifficult to confirm if that particular cosmic ray is causing the\n``absorption.''  Close examination of the profile of this feature\nreveals that it does not have a typical shape and that its noise\nproperties differ significantly from those of the continuum.  We\nconclude that there is no Na~D absorption, especially at $z = 0.015$,\nin the spectrum of PTF10bvr.  A nearby cosmic ray on the detector is\nalso a more likely scenario than PTF10bvr being hosted by a very\nlow-luminosity galaxy in the direct foreground of a more luminous\ngalaxy.\n\nIf we use the redshift of CGCG~224-067 as the redshift of PTF10bvr, it\nis clear that PTF10bvr is a SN~1991bg-like SN~Ia, not similar to\nSN~2002es (Figure~\\ref{f:10bvr}).  Allowing the redshift to be a free\nparameter does not change the classification; the spectrum of PTF10bvr\nis much more similar to SN~1991bg-like objects at $z = 0.03$ than to\nSN~2002es at $z = 0.015$.\n\n\\subsection{SN 2004cs and SN 2007J}\n\n\\citet{Foley09:08ha} first noticed that SN~2007J was spectroscopically\nsimilar to other SNe~Iax with the exception of strong \\ion{He}{I}\nlines present in the spectra of SN~2007J.  \\citetalias{Foley13:iax}\nidentified SN~2004cs as a similar object, being spectroscopically\nsimilar to SNe~Iax, but with strong \\ion{He}{I} lines.  The possible\nphysical association of these objects with the SN~Iax class has\nfar-reaching implications for the progenitors and explosions of\nSNe~Iax, and was one of the strongest reasons (but not the only one)\nthat \\citetalias{Foley13:iax} first suggested that SNe~Iax had\nWD/He-star progenitor systems.\n\n\\citet{White15} disagreed with this classification and claimed the\ndetection of hydrogen lines in the spectra of both SNe, reclassifying\nthese SNe as Type IIb.  We re-evaluate this claim here.\n\nSN~2007J was relatively well observed with four spectra at distinct\nphases (see Figure~\\ref{f:07j}).  Although the exact time of maximum\nbrightness was not measured, a nondetection was useful in constraining\nthat time to within 40~d \\citep{Foley09:08ha, Foley13:iax}.\n\nExamining these spectra, we do not detect any hydrogen lines in\nSN~2007J.  Comparisons to SN~2002cx and SN~IIb~1996cb, the SN~IIb with\nthe weakest H$\\alpha$ emission at late times in the \\citet{Modjaz14}\nsample and the best-matching SN~IIb found, show that SN~2007J is more\nsimilar to SN~2002cx --- even when considering the \\ion{He}{I} lines.\nThis is especially true at early times, where there are significant\ndeviations from SN~1996cb at bluer wavelengths.  In particular, there\nis a strong H$\\beta$ line in the earliest spectrum of SN~1996cb, but\nno corresponding feature for SN~2007J.  From this comparison alone,\nSN~2007J is highly discrepant with even the most similar SN~IIb known.\n\nIn addition to the lack of an H$\\beta$ line in SN~2007J, we note that\nthe feature \\citet{White15} identified as H$\\alpha$ in SN~2007J is\nalso present in SN~2002cx and identified as \\ion{Fe}{II} by\n\\citet{Branch04}.  For SN~2007J, this feature is more similar to that\nof SN~2002cx at early times and evolves in a similar way (at later\ntimes the feature is relatively weak in all spectra).  As SN~2002cx\n(and other SNe~Iax) never show any strong hydrogen emission, including\nat late times, it is unlikely that this feature is H$\\alpha$ in\nSN~2002cx, and similarly unlikely that it is H$\\alpha$ in SN~2007J.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no evidence that SN~2007J is a SN~IIb.  While\nSN~2007J may not be physically related to SNe~Iax, it is most similar\nto these objects, and we consider this classification the most prudent\nat this time.\n\nSN~2004cs does not have as much spectral data as SN~2007J; however, it\ndoes have a very constraining light curve presented by\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax}.  As presented by \\citetalias{Foley13:iax}\nand re-examined here (Figure~\\ref{f:04cs}), SN~2004cs is very similar\nto SN~2007J as well as SN~2002cx (besides the \\ion{He}{I} lines).  As\nwas seen for SN~2007J, there are no obvious hydrogen lines in the\nspectrum of SN~2004cs.  Based on the spectral data available,\nSN~2004cs is extremely similar to SN~2007J, and since SN~2007J is not\na SN~IIb, it is unlikely that SN~2004cs is a SN~IIb.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2004cs}\n  \\caption{Optical spectrum of SN~2004cs (black curve); there is no\n    obvious broad H$\\alpha$ in the spectrum.

In contrast, the prototypical\nSN~IIb~1993J \\citep{Richmond94}, the well-observed SN~IIb~2011dh\n\\citep{Arcavi11, Ergon14}, and the hydrogen-weak SN~IIb~1996cb\n\\citep{Qiu99} all have much broader light curves and a change in decay\nrate occurring between 20~d and 40~d after peak.  \\citet{White15}\nfound that the light curve of SN~2004cs was consistent with the SN~IIb\ntemplate light curve of \\citet{Arcavi12}; however, this comparison\nindicated that SN~2004cs declined faster than the template.  In\naddition, the comparison presented by \\citet{White15} is not ideal.\nThey used the start of the template light curve as the time of\nmaximum, but the \\citet{Arcavi12} template begins roughly 5~d after\nmaximum, when the light curve is declining much faster than right at\npeak.  The template also only covers {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 12 days of the light\ncurve, and so the comparison ignores all premaximum data and the later\ndata where SN~2004cs continues to quickly decline while SNe~IIb\ndecline slower at these phases.  Finally, this template was generated\nfrom only two light curves, with one having only 5 data points over 36\ndays (and 3 at maximum brightness or later), so this template is not\nthe best comparison when excellent data, such as those for SNe~1993J\nand 2011dh, exist.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\n\n  \\includegraphics[angle=0,width=3.2in]{sn2004cs_lc}\n  \\caption{Unfiltered KAIT light curve of SN~2004cs (blue circles, and\n    blue arrows indicating upper-limit nondetections).

While this has not been detected in all SNe~IIb\n(e.g., SN~1996cb; Figure~\\ref{f:04cs_lc}), it has for those SNe with\ndeep, high-cadence observations around the time of explosion, like\nwhat was obtained for SN~2004cs.  Therefore, the deep nondetections\nbefore the rise are highly constraining and indicate that SN~2004cs\nwas not a SN~IIb.  Furthermore, it is unclear if a SN~IIb progenitor\ncould produce such a rapidly evolving light curve (requiring very\nsmall ejecta mass).\n\nFinally, \\citet{Rajala05} measured a single epoch of multiband\nphotometry for SN~2004cs at {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 5~d before maximum brightness,\nfinding colours that were significantly inconsistent with those of\nSNe~IIb as well as all core-collapse SNe.  However, the colours were\nconsistent with those of a young SN~Ia, whose colours are similar to\nthose of SNe~Iax.\n\nIn summary, SN~2004cs has a spectrum similar to that of SN~2007J as\nwell as SN~2002cx (besides the prominent \\ion{He}{I} lines).  While\nSN~2004cs is spectroscopically similar to some SNe~IIb (although we\ncannot confirm any hydrogen in its spectrum), its light curve is\nunlike that of any SN~IIb, rising faster and declining faster than any\nknown SN~IIb.  Furthermore, SN~2004cs lacks the signature of a cooling\nenvelope seen in all SNe~IIb with similar-quality data.  From this, we\nconclude that it is highly unlikely that SN~2004cs is a SN~IIb, while\nbeing very similar to SNe~Iax.\n\n\n\\subsection{Summary and Discussion}\n\nAbove, we showed that PTF09ego may not be a SN~Iax, that PTF09eiy is\nunlikely to be a SN~Iax and more likely to be similar to SN~2009dc and\nother high-luminosity SNe~Ia, and that PTF10bvr is not a\nSN~2002es-like SN.  None the less, 6/9 of the \\citet{White15} sample\nappear to be likely SNe~Iax or SN~2002es-like objects.\n\nWe also re-examine the claims of \\citet{Foley09:08ha} and\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax} that SNe~2004cs and 2007J are SNe~Iax and not\nSNe~IIb as claimed by \\citet{White15}.  We find no evidence of these\nSNe being SNe~IIb and strong evidence against this classification.  We\nalso show that other than the presence of \\ion{He}{I} lines, they are\nvery similar to SNe~Iax.  We therefore continue to classify SNe~2004cs\nand 2007J as SNe~Iax, although we also caution that observations of\nsimilar SNe in the future may indicate that SNe~2004cs and 2007J are\nphysically distinct from SNe~Iax.\n\nOne of the main goals of \\citet{White15} was to measure the relative\nrate of SNe~Iax and SNe~Ia, finding 5.6 SNe~Iax (and SN~2002es-like\nobjects) per 100 SNe~Ia. This value was much smaller than that found\nby \\citetalias{Foley13:iax}, 31 SNe~Iax per 100 SNe~Ia (and not\ncounting SN~2002es-like objects).  While the reclassification of up to\n1/3 of the \\citet{White15} sample may point to an even lower rate, we\ncaution against this conclusion.\n\nWe first note that \\citet{White15} did not correct for the photometric\nand spectroscopic selection of their survey.  Considering that SNe~Iax\nare 1--5~mag fainter than typical SNe~Ia at peak and typically fade\ntwice as fast as SNe~Ia, there must be some photometric selection\nbias.  Additionally, the contrast of relatively faint SNe~Iax compared\nto their host galaxies likely makes detecting the SNe more difficult,\nand may (partially) explain the large fraction of relatively\nlow-surface brightness host galaxies in their sample.\n\nSimilarly, the \\citet{White15} sample almost certainly suffers from\nspectroscopic selection bias.  They mention nine SNe that have some\nspectroscopic similarities to SNe~Iax and SN~2002es, but most were\nrejected from the final sample because of low-S/N spectra.  These\nadditional objects alone could double the measured rate.\n\nWe further note that of the six \\citet{White15} SN~Iax candidates, the\nearliest spectra were obtained at +13, +14, +23, +25, +26, and +56~d\nrelative to maximum brightness, with the earliest spectra coming from\nPTF09ego (which is perhaps not a SN~Iax) and PTF09eiy (which is\nunlikely to be a SN~Iax).  However, 30--55\\% of the PTF SN~Ia sample\nhave at least one spectrum before +5~d \\citep{Maguire14}.  Assuming\nthat the PTF SN~Ia and SN~Iax spectroscopic selection functions are\nidentical and adopting the most favourable conditions, there is only a\n12\\% chance of having no SN~Iax in the \\citet{White15} sample with a\nspectrum before +5~d (0.8\\% assuming the higher fraction (55\\%) with\nearly-time spectra, and it is further unlikely to have no spectra\nbetween +5 and +13~d and extremely unlikely to have no spectra before\n+23~d, which is the earliest spectrum of a definitive SN~Iax in the\nsample).  Considering that SNe~Iax are less luminous than SNe~Iax, one\nwould expect relatively {\\it more} spectra near maximum light for this\nclass.\n\nOne likely reason for this discrepancy is the method for selecting\nmembers of the class.  \\citet{White15} make two decisions that\nprobably bias against selecting SNe~Iax near maximum brightness.  The\nfirst is that they only selected SNe where {\\tt superfit} returned a\nmatch with a SN~Iax in its top 15 matches.  However, it is well known\n(e.g., \\citealt{Li03:02cx}; \\citetalias{Jha06:02cx}) that near maximum\nbrightness, SN~Iax spectra are very similar to those of SNe~Ia except\nfor their velocity, which is degenerate with redshift when doing a\n$\\chi^{2}$ fit as {\\tt superfit} does.  In fact, 12 of the 25 SNe~Iax\nin the \\citetalias{Foley13:iax} sample were at some point\nmisclassified, often because of this effect.\n\nTo test this possibility, we classified the $-1$~d spectrum of\nSN~2002cx \\citep{Li03:02cx} using {\\tt SNID} \\citep{Blondin07}.\nAlthough {\\tt SNID} is a different algorithm than {\\tt superfit}, this\nexperiment is illustrative.  With no prior on the redshift, there were\nno SNe~Iax in the top 20 spectral matches.  Putting the correct prior\non the redshift, the SN is still not correctly classified, with no\nSNe~Iax in the top 15 spectral matches.  Therefore, SNe without\nhost-galaxy redshifts are particularly prone to misclassification.\nThis problem is likely amplified with noisy data.\n\nAn additional selection bias is the ``peak counting'' employed by\n\\citet{White15}.  Starting {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 2~weeks after maximum light, SNe~Iax\nhave very complex spectra with many distinct spectral features.\nHowever, this is not the case near maximum brightness.  While\n\\citet{White15} do not explicitly state how many peaks (in the range\n6000 -- 8000~\\AA) are necessary for inclusion in their final sample,\nit appears to be around 7 given the objects that were included.\nAlthough there is no description of exactly how significant a peak\nmust be to be counted, we attempted this analysis for SN~Iax~2011ay,\nwhich has one of the best spectral sequences between peak and +30~d\n\\citepalias{Foley13:iax}.  We find that the spectra spanning phases of\n$-2$ to +11~d all have $<$7 peaks, while the spectra after +26~d all\nhave $\\ge$7 peaks.  Therefore, if there were only a single\nmaximum-light spectrum of SN~2011ay, it would likely be excluded from\nthe \\citet{White15} analysis, even if it passes the {\\tt superfit}\ncriterion.\n\nWhile the smaller sample of genuine SNe~Iax in the \\citet{White15}\nsample may, at first glance, appear to make the relative rate even\nless consistent with the rate of \\citetalias{Foley13:iax}, the various\nphotometric biases, spectroscopic biases, sample-selection biases, and\nalready identified ambiguous objects are likely the reasons for the\ndifference.\n\nAs further confirmation of the ``high'' rate of\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax}, we recalculate the relative rate using only\nSNe within $D \\lesssim 20$~Mpc.  In the last 10~yr, there have been 5\nSNe~Iax discovered within this volume: SNe~2008ge\n\\citep{Foley10:08ge}, 2008ha \\citep{Foley09:08ha, Foley10:08ha,\n  Valenti09}, 2010ae \\citep{Stritzinger14:10ae}, 2010el, and 2014dt\n\\citep{Foley15:14dt}.  During this same time, there were {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n25~SNe~Ia discovered in this volume.  Without any additional\ncorrections, this places a very robust lower limit on the relative\nrate of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 24 SNe~Iax for every 100 SNe~Ia, consistent with the\n\\citetalias{Foley13:iax} rate and significantly inconsistent with the\n\\citet{White15} rate.\n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{mnras}\n\\bibliography{../astro_refs}\n\n\\onecolumn\n\n\\begin{deluxetable}{rllrl}\n\n\n\\tablewidth{0pt}\n\\tablecaption{Log of Spectral Observations of

radius.  The uncertainty in this measurement is around 2\\%\nand primarily set by the uncertainty in the measured velocity.\n\nThese two discrepant estimates of the photospheric radius cannot be\nreconciled by any simple adjustment of the measured quantities.\nFirst, the late-time photospheric velocity would need to be\noverestimated such that the true velocity is $v_{\\rm ph} \\lesssim\n40$~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}, which is much too low to be consistent with the spectrum.\nAlternatively, the bolometric luminosity could be {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n$10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, which is $>$2 orders of magnitude higher than\nmeasured.  Finally, a true temperature of 2500~K would sufficiently\nreduce the measured blackbody radius; however, at this temperature, we\nwould not expect to see any \\ion{Fe}{II} emission.  Furthermore, such\na low temperature would require that the continuum seen in the spectra\nbe caused by a nonblackbody component, making our luminosity\nassumption incorrect --- a lower blackbody luminosity with this lower\ntemperature is similarly inconsistent with the kinematic radius.  In\nsummary, it does not appear that a poor assumption or measurement\nerror has resulted in this discrepancy.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the different radius estimates is\nasymmetry, but this ultimately seems unlikely.  The kinematic radius\ndescribes the radius along the line of sight, while the blackbody\nradius describes the (average) radius in the plane of the sky.  A\nhighly asymmetric explosion could thus have very different\nmeasurements for the radius.  However, this would require an extreme\naspect ratio and very particular viewing angle.  This becomes even\nless likely considering the number of other SNe~Iax similar to\nSN~2005hk and the lack of strong polarization at early times for\nSN~2005hk \\citep{Chornock06, Maund10:05hk}.\n\nAlternatively, the photospheric material may not have been expanding\nsince the time of explosion.  If the material generating the\nphotosphere were launched at 410~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ 30--40~d before the time of the\nspectrum (with a shorter period if there is deceleration), this would\nplace the kinematic radius at the same radius as the blackbody radius.\nHowever, in this scenario, the material would not be caused by the\ninitial explosion and must be a wind from either the companion star or\na surviving remnant.\n\nIn the case of a wind, the velocity of the photosphere should be\nessentially the wind velocity; the SN explosion would have created a\ncavity and so there would be minimal deceleration.  (However, if there\nis a bound remnant, there may be infalling material even at late times\nwhich could decelerate the wind.)  Assuming that the photosphere seen\nat late times for SN~2005hk is the result of a 410~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ wind,\nequivalent to the escape speed of a compact remnant, this remnant\nwould have a radius at late times of\n\n\n\n\n$R = 8 \\times 10^{10} \\left ( M / 0.5 {\\rm M}_{\\sun} \\right ) {\\rm\n  ~cm} = 1.2 \\left ( M / 0.5 {\\rm M}_{\\sun} \\right ) {\\rm R}_{\\sun}$.\nFor this scenario, the mass-loss rate would need to be high enough\nsuch that the wind remains optically thick out to a radius of {$\\sim\\!\\!$~}\n$10^{14}$~cm, or {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} $10^{3} {\\rm R}_{\\sun}$.\n\nThe velocity of the permitted lines seen in the SN~2005hk spectra\ndecreased by {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 100~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}\\ between 245~d and 417~d after explosion,\ncorresponding to {$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 0.5~{\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$}~d$^{-1}$.  This incredibly slow\nchange in the photospheric velocity is also difficult to explain with\na single homologous expansion, thus favouring a wind interpretation.\n\n\\subsection{A Two-Component Ejecta Model}\n\nThe above radius estimates argue for a late-time wind from the\nprogenitor system.  Explosion models which match the early-time\nspectra and light curves of SNe~Iax also argue for a bound remnant\n\\citep{Jordan12, Kromer13, Kromer15}.  These models predict that a\nsignificant amount ({$\\sim\\!\\!$~} 0.02~M$_{\\sun}$) of $^{56}$Ni will remain\nin the remnant, providing an energy source that may be able to drive\ndynamical outflows.  It is reasonable to think that after a SN~Iax\nexplosion a bound remnant would expand to $R \\approx {\\rm R}_{\\sun}$\nand drive a super-Eddington wind (Bildsten et~al., in prep.).  This\nmodel also solves the problem of having low-velocity material from an\nexplosion that completely disrupted the star \\citep{McCully14:iax}.\n\nHowever, for our observations, we do not require that the wind comes\nfrom a bound remnant.  Rather, the wind could be caused by the remnant\nor the companion star.  While it is not yet possible to distinguish\nbetween these two possibilities, the significant $^{56}$Ni in the\nbound remnant would be a natural energy source to drive such a wind.\n\nIn the wind scenario, the photosphere is significantly smaller than\nthe forbidden-line emitting region, which is likely dominated by SN\nejecta.  For the case of SN~2005hk, assuming that nearly all of the\nluminosity comes from the photosphere at late times, the photosphere\nwas at $R \\approx 10^{14}$~cm at +402~d, while the forbidden-line\nemitting region should be at\n\n", "index": 5, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  R_{\\rm ej} \\approx 1.3 \\times 10^{16} \\left ( \\frac{v}{3500 {\\rm ~km~s}^{-1}} \\right ) \\left ( \\frac{t}{417 {\\rm ~d}} \\right ) {\\rm ~cm},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"R_{\\rm ej}\\approx 1.3\\times 10^{16}\\left(\\frac{v}{3500{\\rm~{}km~{}s}^{-1}}%&#10;\\right)\\left(\\frac{t}{417{\\rm~{}d}}\\right){\\rm~{}cm},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>ej</mi></msub><mo>\u2248</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>1.3</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>16</mn></msup></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>v</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>3500</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>km</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">s</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>t</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>417</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo rspace=\"5.8pt\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>cm</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
