Firstly, it portrays a {non-standard analysis}\\ as a functor, namely a functor ${^\\star}$ that maps any set $A$ to the set ${^\\star} A$ of its {non-standard}\\ elements. That functor, from the category of sets to itself, is postulated to be an equivalence on the full subcategory of finite sets onto itself and to preserve finite projective limits (equivalently, to preserve finite products and equalizers). Secondly, ``Local'' {non-standard analysis}\\ is introduced as a structure which we call {lim-rim}, in particular exact {lim-rim} s. The interplay between these, and ultrafilters and ultrapowers, and also cardinality relations and notions depending on a cardinality such as saturation and what we call ``confinement'' and ``exactness'', are investigated.\n\nIn particular, one constructs {non-standard}\\ analyses, with ``good'' kinds of {lim-rim}. In these one may say that ${^\\star} A$ -- ``the adjunction of all possible limits from $A$'' -- plays a role analogous to that of the algebraic closure of a field -- ``the adjunction of all roots of polynomials''. Then in the same spirit as with the latter, one has uniqueness up to isomorphism, and also universality and homogeneity, provided one has enough General Continuum Hypothesis. The cardinality of ${^\\star} A$ will be something like $2^{2^{|A|}}$ -- the same as that of the set of ultrafilters in $A$, and one has a high degree of saturation.\n\nAlso, one notes that the functor ${^\\star}$ can be applied again to ${^\\star} A$, giving ${^\\star}{^\\star} A$,\n${^\\star}{^\\star}{^\\star} A$, and so forth. In particular, we focus on the two different embeddings of ${^\\star} A$ into ${^\\star}{^\\star} A$ and prove some of their properties, with some applications.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\\setcounter{section}{-1}\n\nThis note is a sequel to the less formal \\cite{Levy}. Here I make things more precise, clarify and develop them, and add some material about iterated {non-standard analysis}. In particular, a {non-standard analysis}\\ (which here gives ``non-standard elements'' to any set) is approached as a functor (a connection between {non-standard analysis}\\ and category theory was given in \\cite{Saigo}). ``Local'' {non-standard analysis}\\ is introduced as a structure which I call {lim-rim}, in particular exact {lim-rim} s. The interplay between these, and ultrafilters and ultrapowers, and also cardinality relations and notions depending on a cardinality such as saturation and what I call ``confinement'' and ``exactness'', are investigated.{\\par\\medskip}\n \nIn the second section, dedicated to iterated {non-standard analysis}, the two embeddings $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$ of ${^\\star} A$ into ${^\\star}{^\\star} A$ are focused upon. These embeddings are highly distinct. In the last paragraph a simple criterion (Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:nunustar}) that the values they take satisfy a given standard relation is given, which has some interesting consequences and applications.\n\n\\section{Notations}\nDenote the cardinality of a set $A$ by $|A|$.\nFor a cardinality ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, denote by ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}^+$ the successor cardinality.\nDenote the power set of a set $A$ (the set of all subsets of $A$) by ${\\mathcal{P}} A$.\n\n\\section{{Non-Standard Analysis}}\n\n\\subsection{{Non-Standard Analysis}\\ as a Functor}\n\\begin{Def}\\label{Def:na}\nLet ${\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$ be the category of sets and maps between them, and let ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$ be its\nfull subcategory of finite sets and maps between them.\nA {{\\em\\bf}{non-standard analysis}} will be defined as a (covariant) functor ${^\\star}:{\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}\\to{\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$ which (i) maps ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$ to itself as a self-equivalence of ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$; (ii) preserves finite projective limits.\n\\end{Def}\n\n${^\\star}$ of a set $A$ will be denoted by ${^\\star} A$ and its elements will be referred to as the {{\\em\\bf}{non-standard}\\ elements} of $A$ (thus, if $A$ is, say, the set of integers, then the elements of ${^\\star} A$ will be called ${^\\star}$integers). Similarly the image by ${^\\star}$ of a map $f$ will be denoted by ${^\\star} f$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIn particular, for every $a$ the set $\\{a\\}$ is a singleton, thus an object of ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$, and ${^\\star}$ being an equivalence on ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$, ${^\\star}\\{a\\}$ is also a singleton and its sole element will be denoted by $\\nu(a)$ ($\\nu$ from ``new''). In many cases, we will tend to identify $a$ with $\\nu(a)$ (see below).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nAs for condition (ii), it is equivalent to ${^\\star}$ preserving finite products (equivalently products of two sets $A$ and $B$, being the projective limit of the diagram $A,B$ (no maps)\\NOT{, characterized by the appropriate universal property}) and equalizers $\\{c\\in C|f_1(c)=f_2(c)\\}$ of two maps $f_1,f_2:C\\to D$, (i.e.\\ the projective limit of the diagram $C{\\to\\atop\\to}D$ -- the maps are $f_1$ and $f_2$\\NOT{ -- characterized by the appropriate universal property}).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThis means that the images by ${^\\star}$ of the projections $A\\times B\\to A,\\,A\\times B\\to B$ make ${^\\star}(A\\times B)$ the product ${^\\star} A\\times{^\\star} B$; and if $E$ is the subset $\\{c\\in C\\,|\\,f_1(c)=f_2(c)\\}$, i.e., with the inclusion map $E\\to C$, the equalizer of $f_1$ and $f_2$, then ${^\\star}$ of the inclusion map makes ${^\\star} E$ the equalizer of ${^\\star} f_1,{^\\star} f_2:{^\\star} C\\to{^\\star} D$. But since any subset of $C$ is an equalizer, this means that ${^\\star}$ of any inclusion map $E\\to C$ is injective, and can be viewed as an inclusion ${^\\star} E\\subset{^\\star} C$, and in the above situation ${^\\star} E=\\{{^\\star} c\\in{^\\star} C\\,|\\,{^\\star} f_1({^\\star} c)={^\\star} f_2({^\\star} c)\\}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIn particular, ${^\\star}$ of the diagonal of $A\\times A$ -- the equalizer of the two projections -- can serve as the diagonal of ${^\\star} A\\times{^\\star} A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\begin{exm}\\label{exm:na}\n\nOf course, a trivial example for {non-standard analysis}\\ is the identity functor, where ${{^\\star}}A=A$ and all {non-standard}\\ elements are, in fact, standard -- of the form $\\nu(a)$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo get a non-trivial example, Let $S$ be a fixed set of indices and ${\\mathcal{U}}$ a fixed ultrafilter in $S$. For any set $A$ we have the {{\\em\\bf} ultrapower} $A_{\\mathcal{U}}:=A^S/{\\mathcal{U}}$, defined as the power $A^S$ modulo the equivalence relation: equality modulo ${\\mathcal{U}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe have here a covariant functor $A\\mapsto A_{\\mathcal{U}}$ (which depends on $S$ and ${\\mathcal{U}}$)\nfrom the category of sets to itself.  The image $f_{\\mathcal{U}}$ by the functor of a map $f:A\\to B$ between sets will map $[\\xi]\\in A_{\\mathcal{U}}$, where $\\xi:S\\to A$, to $[f\\circ\\xi]\\in B_{\\mathcal{U}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThis ultrapower functor satisfies (i) and (ii) of Definition \\ref{Def:na}. Indeed, (i) is immediate, because if $F$ is finite then for any $\\xi:S\\to F$ there is a unique $a\\in F$ such that $\\xi^{-1}(\\{a\\})\\in{\\mathcal{U}}$, and then $\\xi$ is, modulo ${\\mathcal{U}}$, the constant $a$. As for (ii), this functor preserves finite products - $(A\\times B)_{\\mathcal{U}}$ is identified with\n$A_{\\mathcal{U}}\\times B_{\\mathcal{U}}$ in an obvious manner, and if $f_1,f_2:C\\to D$, and\n$E=\\{c\\in C\\,|\\,f_1(c)=f_2(c)\\}$ is the equalizer, then the equalizer of $(f_1)_{\\mathcal{U}},(f_2)_{\\mathcal{U}}:C_{\\mathcal{U}}\\to D_{\\mathcal{U}}$ is\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&&\\{[\\xi]\\in C_{\\mathcal{U}}\\,|\\,(f_1)_{\\mathcal{U}}([\\xi])=(f_2)_{\\mathcal{U}}([\\xi])\\}=\\\\\n&&=\\{[\\xi]\\in C_{\\mathcal{U}}\\,|\\,[f_1\\circ\\xi]=[f_2\\circ\\xi]\\}=\\\\\n&&=\\{[\\xi]\\in C_{\\mathcal{U}}\\,|\\,\\exists U\\in{\\mathcal{U}},\\,\\,(f_1\\circ\\xi)|_U=(f_2\\circ\\xi)|_U\\}=\\\\\n&&=\\{[\\xi]\\in C_{\\mathcal{U}}\\,|\\,\\exists U\\in{\\mathcal{U}}\\,\\,\\xi(U)\\subset E\\}=\\\\\n&&=\\{[\\xi]\\in C_{\\mathcal{U}}\\,|\\,\\exists\\eta:S\\to E\\,\\,[\\xi]=[\\eta]\\},\n\\end{eqnarray*}\nwhich is identified with $E_{\\mathcal{U}}$.\\qed{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThis means that taking ${^\\star} A:=$ the ultrapower $A_{\\mathcal{U}}$, gives us a {non-standard analysis}, {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}.{\\par\\medskip}\n\\end{exm}\n\n\\subsection{{Non-Standard Analysis}\\ as a Functor, continued}\\label{S:NAFco}\nIf $A$ is a set and $a\\in A$, there is an inclusion map $\\{a\\}\\to A$, and its ${^\\star}$ is an injection ${^\\star}\\{a\\}\\to{^\\star} A$, i.e.\\ $\\{\\nu(a)\\}\\to{^\\star} A$, identifying $\\nu(a)$ with an element of ${^\\star} A$ (Consequently, if $A\\ne\\emptyset$ then ${^\\star} A\\ne\\emptyset$) -- if $a$ belongs to some (standard) set -- has some property -- then $\\nu(a)$ is one of the {non-standard}\\ elements of the set -- has the ${^\\star}$property. These $\\nu(a)$'s, with $a\\in A$, might be referred to as the {{\\em\\bf} standard elements} of $A$, but (if $A$ is infinite) $A$ may have other elements, not of the form $\\nu(a)$,\\,\\,$a\\in A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nSimilarly, $\\nu(a_1,\\ldots,a_n)$ is identified with $(\\nu(a_1),\\ldots,\\nu(a_n))$, and if $a_1\\,\\ldots,a_n$ satisfy some relation $R\\subset A_1\\times\\cdots\\times A_n$ then $\\nu(a_1),\\ldots,\\nu(a_n)$ satisfies ${^\\star} R$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe will sometimes loosely view any finite set $F$ as a set of a kind of {\\em truth-values} and any map between finite sets $f:F_1\\to F_2$ as a kind of {\\em logical operation}, \\`a la {\\bf AND}, {\\bf OR}, {\\bf NOT}. Then the equivalence that ${^\\star}$ induces on ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$ is used as an identification for these truth-values and logical operations. Maps $f:A_1\\times A_2\\times\\cdot\\times A_n\\to F$, where $A_i, i=1\\ldots n$ are sets and $F$ is finite, are viewed as {\\em predicates} on $A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_n$. Composing them with maps between finite sets defines a kind of {\\em logical operations among predicates}. But the fact that ${^\\star}$ preserves finite products and equalizers makes, e.g., a ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}^2$-valued predicate the same as a pair of ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued predicates, and if $F'\\subset F$ then $F'$-valued predicates embed into $F$-valued ones. Therefore the ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued predicates determine all others, while applying ${^\\star}$ to predicates commutes with all ``logical operations'', in other words, applying ${^\\star}$ to ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued predicates commutes with the propositional calculus operations {\\bf AND}, {\\bf OR}, {\\bf NOT} etc.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nAs said above, we identify $\\nu({\\textbf{True}})={\\textbf{True}}$,\\,\\,$\\nu({\\textbf{False}})={\\textbf{False}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nFor any ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued predicate $f$, if $E$ is the subset of\n$A_1\\times A_2\\times\\cdots\\times A_n$ where it holds, then $E$ is the equalizer of $f$ with the constant map $A_1\\times A_2\\times\\cdots\\times A_n\\to{\\textbf{True}}$, the latter being the composition of $\\{{\\textbf{True}}\\}\\to{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$ with the sole map\n$A_1\\times A_2\\times\\cdots\\times A_n\\to\\{{\\textbf{True}}\\}$. Hence its ${^\\star}$ is the constant\n${{^\\star}}A_1\\times{}{{^\\star}}A_2\\times\\cdots\\times{}{{^\\star}}A_n\\to{\\textbf{True}}$ and ${^\\star} E$, as a subset of\n${{^\\star}}A_1\\times{}{{^\\star}}A_2\\times\\cdots\\times{}{{^\\star}}A_n$, will be its equalizer with ${^\\star} f$, i.e.\\ the set where ${^\\star} f$ holds.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nAs for quantifiers, we shall show that the operation ${^\\star}$ on ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued predicates commutes with them too. Since it commutes with {\\bf NOT}, it suffices to show that it commutes with $\\exists$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nGiven a predicate $f:A_1\\times A_2\\times\\cdots\\times A_n\\to{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$, to which we apply $(\\exists x_1\\in A_1)$, we get the predicate $(\\exists x_1\\in A_1)f$, and we have to prove that the ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued functions (``predicates''):\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:exists}\n{^\\star}[(\\exists\\,x_1\\in A_1)\\,f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)]=\n(\\exists\\,{^\\star} x_1\\in{}{{^\\star}}A_1)\\,{^\\star} f({^\\star} x_1,\\ldots{^\\star} x_n).\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{{}^{\\star}}[(\\exists\\,x_{1}\\in A_{1})\\,f(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n})]=(\\exists\\,{{}^{%&#10;\\star}}x_{1}\\in{}{{{}^{\\star}}}A_{1})\\,{{}^{\\star}}f({{}^{\\star}}x_{1},\\ldots{%&#10;{}^{\\star}}x_{n}).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mmultiscripts><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">\u2203</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u2208</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>f</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mprescripts/><none/><mo>\u22c6</mo></mmultiscripts><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">\u2203</mo><mmultiscripts><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn><none/><mprescripts/><none/><mo>\u22c6</mo></mmultiscripts><mo>\u2208</mo><mmultiscripts><mi>A</mi><mn>1</mn><none/><mprescripts/><none/><mo>\u22c6</mo></mmultiscripts><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mmultiscripts><mi>f</mi><mprescripts/><none/><mo>\u22c6</mo></mmultiscripts><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mmultiscripts><mi>x</mi><mn>1</mn><none/><mprescripts/><none/><mo>\u22c6</mo></mmultiscripts><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mmultiscripts><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi><none/><mprescripts/><none/><mo>\u22c6</mo></mmultiscripts><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00488.tex", "nexttext": "\nis true, therefore\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 16578, "prevtext": "\nIf $A_1=\\emptyset$ this is immediate.

In his and\nfollowing treatments (see several treatises in the bibliography)\n\\footnote{In another direction, beginning with E.~Nelson \\cite{Nelson}, one\nconstructs a special Set Theory for {non-standard analysis}.}\nthe idea is to start with a ``big'' structure -- a set $V$, with the restriction to it of the membership relation $\\in$, which will be big enough so that usual mathematics could be done in it (should contain, e.g.\\ ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ (the natural numbers), ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ (the real numbers), sets of them, sets of these etc.) $V$ is to be provided with a ``mirror'' ``{non-standard}''\nstructure ${^\\star} V$ with a relation ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$, viewed as an ``interpretation'' of the $\\in$ of $V$ (Also, ``interpret'' ``$=$'' in $V$ by ``$=$'' in ${^\\star} V$), so that\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\n$V$ is embedded in ${^\\star} V$ -- identified with a subset of ${^\\star} V$. The members of\n$V$ (thus considered as members of ${^\\star} V$) are referred to as {\\em standard}\n(yet by ``{non-standard}'' elements we mean any members of ${^\\star} V$).\n\n\\item\nA {\\em Transfer Principle} holds: any (in some constructions one has to say:\n``bounded'') first-order logical expression with members of $V$ as constants which is a true sentence when quantifiers are interpreted relative to $V$ will remain a true sentence if (the constants -- members of $V$ -- are replaced by their identified images in ${^\\star} V$ and) $\\in$ is replaced by ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$ and the quantifiers are interpreted relative to ${^\\star} V$. In this sense ${^\\star} V$ is a model to the true in $V$ sentences of the first-order theory with $\\in$ and all elements of $V$ as constants.\n\n\\item\nBy Transfer, for any standard set $A$, a standard $a\\in V$ will be an ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-member of it if and only if it is a usual member, but in ${^\\star} V$\\,\\,$A$ may have other, {\\em{non-standard}} members. The set of all elements of ${^\\star} V$ which ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-belong to $A$ is denoted by ${^\\star} A$. Again by Transfer, ${^\\star} (A\\times B)$ is canonically identified with ${^\\star} A\\times\\,{^\\star} B$, thus for relations, functions etc.\\ we have the ${^\\star}$-relation, ${^\\star}$-function etc.\\ among members of ${^\\star} V$ (which for standard elements coincides with the original relation, function\netc.) When there is no danger of misunderstanding, one often uses the same\nsymbol (e.g.\\ $+$, $<$) for the ${^\\star}$-relation etc.\\ as for the original.\n\n\\item\n${^\\star} V$ is indeed ``{non-standard}'' -- it contains elements not in $V$, and one has features, usually some kind of ``saturation'' (see below), which will ensure, say, that there is an ${^\\star} n\\in{^\\star} V$ which ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-belongs to the set ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ of natural numbers, but such that for every standard $m\\in N$,\\,\\,$m\\;{{^\\star}\\!\\!}<{^\\star} n$ (i.e.\\ $(m,{^\\star} n)$ ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-belongs to the graph of $<$). Such ${^\\star} n$'s are naturally referred to as\n``infinite'' or ``unlimited''\n\\footnote{In fact, as in footnote \\ref{f:i}, for ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ the existence of ``infinite'' members needs only the existence of some not standard members -- one easily proves using Transfer that all ${^\\star}$-members of a finite standard $A$ are standard, hence any ${^\\star}$-member of ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ which is not standard is automatically bigger than all standard\nnumbers.}\nand by Transfer they have reciprocals in ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, referred to as ``infinitesimal''.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe ``philosophy'' here is to develop the theory from these properties, paying\nless attention to the way such ${^\\star} V$ is constructed (or proved to exist).\nThe usual construction is by an ultrapower or a modification of it.\nAnyway, one has to have a set $V$ to make the construction, hence only\nsubsets of it will have {non-standard}\\ members.\n{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\subsection{Ultrafilters of {Non-Standard}\\ Elements}\nLet us be given a {non-standard analysis}, {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}. For any set $A$, and any\n${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$, and for any $S\\subset A$, we have ${^\\star} S\\subset{^\\star} A$, thus either\n${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} S$ or ${^\\star} x$ is not in ${^\\star} S$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ it is in the complement\n${{^\\star}}A\\setminus{^\\star} S={^\\star} (A\\setminus S)$. Put otherwise: for any ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued predicate\n$f:A\\to{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$ we have ${^\\star} f:{}{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star}{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}={\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$ and ${^\\star} f({^\\star} x)$ is either ${\\textbf{True}}$ or ${\\textbf{False}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nHence any ${^\\star} x\\in{}{^\\star} A$ induces a map ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}^A\\to{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$, which is easily seen to be a Boolean-algebra homomorphism, i.e.\\ an ultrafilter in $A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIn fact, we may replace ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$ by any other finite set $F$, and view the set ${\\beta} A$ of the ultrafilters in $A$ as the set of natural mappings between the functor from ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$ to ${\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$\\,\\,$F\\mapsto F^A={\\text{Hom}}(A,F)$, and the inclusion functor ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}\\to{\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThen to a ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$ corresponds the ultrafilter: the mapping $[f\\mapsto{^\\star} f({^\\star} x)]:{\\text{Hom}}(A,F)\\to F$. This is clearly a natural mapping between the functors $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A$ and $A\\mapsto{\\beta} A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNote, that although the functor $A\\mapsto{\\beta} A$ is a canonically defined functor on sets, which maps injections to injections, it does not preserve finite products (hence is not a {non-standard analysis}\\ {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}). The projections $A\\times B\\to A$ and $A\\times B\\to B$ define onto mappings ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} A$ and ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} B$, hence induce a ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} A\\times{\\beta} B$, which is also onto, but is usually not one-to-one. Thus this functor does not satisfy (ii) of Definition \\ref{Def:na} (while it satisfies (i)).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nOne may view a {non-standard analysis}\\ as a quest to extend sets by adjoining all (or some) possible limits. This in close analogy in spirit to extending a field to its algebraic closure by adjoining all possible roots of algebraic equations. In the latter case one would like to simply define the adjoined elements as labeled by the irreducible polynomial they satisfy, but that is hampered by such facts as the polynomial whose roots are the sums of the roots of two irreducible polynomials being not irreducible.\n\\footnote{Which may be viewed as the ``reason'' for the existence of several\nconjugate roots: the polynomial $d(t)$ whose roots are the differences of the\nroots of the irreducible $f(t)$ has a factor $t$ but also other irreducible\nfactors, testifying to differences $\\ne0$.}\nThe algebraic closure thus contains conjugate elements with the same irreducible polynomial and for any such elements there is an automorphism of the algebraic closure exchanging them.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nSimilarly in our case we would like to label the adjoined ``{non-standard}\\ elements'' by\nthe ultrafilters on the original set. After all, these ultrafilters (and ultrafilters in finite products of sets) give all the possible ways properties (and relations) can conceivably hold or not. But that would not work precisely because the functor ${\\beta}$ does not preserve finite products. There is a naturally defined Cartesian product of filters, but the Cartesian product of two ultrafilters ${\\mathcal{U}}\\in{\\beta} A,{\\mathcal{V}}\\in{\\beta} B$ is in general not an ultrafilter -- it is the intersection of all ultrafilters in $A\\times B$ that map to $({\\mathcal{U}},{\\mathcal{V}})$ in the above mapping ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} A\\times{\\beta} B$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe too will have a construction (\\S\\ref{S:car}) where there will be ``conjugate'' {non-standard}\\ elements with the same ultrafilter and any such conjugate elements will be exchangeable by an automorphism, provided one has enough General Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), and then, in the same spirit as with algebraic closures, one has uniqueness (for fixed ``basis'' $B$ -- see below) up to isomorphism, and also universality and homogeneity.\n{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\n\\subsection{{Lim-Rim} s -- Local {Non-Standard Analysis}}\nGiven a {non-standard analysis}, one may focus on a particular set $B$ and try to extract what the {non-standard analysis}\\ says about this $B$ (hence about its subsets).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThe information telling which {non-standard}\\ elements satisfy which relations is encoded in the ultrafilters on $B^I$,\\,$I$ finite. The {non-standard analysis}\\ gives us a natural mapping $({^\\star} B)^I\\to{\\beta}(B^I)$ between these two (contravariant) functors on $I$ from ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$ to ${\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$. If for any set $I\\in{\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$ we will define ${\\beta}_c(A^I)$ as the set of ultrafilters on the {\\em cylinder Boolean algebra of $B^I$} (the members of the cylinder Boolean algebra are the subsets of $B^I$ that depend only on a finite number of coordinates. In case $I$ is finite this is just the power set of $B^I$), then any natural $({^\\star} B)^I\\to{\\beta}(B^I)$ on the finite sets $I$ extends in a unique way to a natural $({^\\star} B)^I\\to{\\beta}_c(B^I)$ on all sets $I$. Moreover, we can take $I={^\\star} B$ itself and then the image by the natural mapping of any element of $({^\\star} B)^I$ will be known if we know the image in ${\\beta}_c\\left( B^{{}{{^\\star}}B}\\right)$ of the identity family $\\in({^\\star} B)^{{^\\star} B}$.\n\n\\begin{Def}\nWe say that a set $E$ has the structure of a {{\\em\\bf}{lim-rim}} over a set\n\\footnote{we shall usually have $B$ infinite.}\n(basis) $B$ if either of the equivalent following is given. (i) An  ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}$ on the cylinder Boolean algebra of $B^E$, which will be referred to as the {{\\em\\bf} defining cylinder ultrafilter} of the {lim-rim}\\ (then we shall also speak of the {lim-rim}\\ $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$ over $B$). (ii) A natural mapping between the (contravariant) functors on sets $I$: $E^I$ and ${\\beta}_c(B^I)$, where the latter denotes the set of ultrafilters in the cylinder Boolean algebra. It will be referred to as the {{\\em\\bf} defining natural mapping} of the {lim-rim}. (Note that these functors and the natural mapping are defined for any $I$, yet they are determined by giving them for the finite $I$.)\n\\end{Def}\n\nHere, the defining cylinder ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}$ in $B^E$ can be recovered as the image, by the natural mapping, in ${\\beta}_c\\left( B^E\\right)$, of the identity family in $E^E$. On the other hand, if ${\\mathcal{L}}$ is given, what it does is deciding, for any (finite) family $\\eta\\in E^I$ indexed by a finite $I$ (pushing ${\\mathcal{L}}$, using the map $B^E\\to B^I$ induced by $\\eta:I\\to E$, to\nan ultrafilter in $B^I$) whether relations -- subsets of $B^I$ -- hold or\nnot, thus transferring such $I$-relations in $B$ (= subsets of $B^I$) into\n$I$-relations in $E$, as a {non-standard}\\ setting should. This new $I$-relation in $E$ will be referred to as the {\\em transfer} or ${^\\star}$ of the original $I$-relation in $B$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo put it otherwise: for an $n$-tuple $(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$ of elements of $E$, a\nrelation $R\\subset B^n$\\,\\,${^\\star}$-holds for $(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$ if and only if for $\\psi\\in B^E$,\n$(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})\\in R$ holds modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo conclude:{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\begin{Prop}\nGiven a {non-standard analysis}\\ {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}, it induces on any set $B$ a {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$, where $E={^\\star} B$.\n\\end{Prop}\nAnd as said above, this {lim-rim}\\ captures which relations about $B$, or its subsets, are satisfied by $n$-tuples of {non-standard}\\ elements $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$. We may say that a {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$ defines a ``local'' {non-standard analysis}, with $E$ the set of {non-standard}\\ elements of $B$, completely satisfactory as a {non-standard analysis}\\ as long as one restricts oneself only to $B$ or its subsets.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\begin{Rmk}\nThere can be sub-{lim-rim} s of a {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$ in two ways (or both combined):\nFirstly, any subset $E'\\subset E$ has the structure of a {lim-rim}\\ over $B$,\nand secondly for any $B'\\subset B$ the set ${^\\star} B'$ of the $e\\in E$ that satisfy\nthe ${^\\star} $ of `` belongs to $B'$ '' forms a {lim-rim}\\ over $B'$. Instead of\ntalking about sub-{lim-rim} s one may talk about embeddings. Isomorphisms and\nautomorphisms of {lim-rim} s are defined as expected (as those which respect the\nultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}$).\n\\end{Rmk}\n{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\subsection{Confined {Non-Standard Analysis}, Separated and Rectified {Lim-Rim} s}\n\\begin{Def}\nLet ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ be an infinite cardinality. Given a {non-standard analysis}\\ {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}, let $A$ be a set and ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$. We say that ${^\\star} x$ is {{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined} or has {{\\em\\bf} confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$} if there exists a (standard) set $A'\\subset A$ of cardinality $\\le{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ such that ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A'$. If ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ is a cardinality such that all {non-standard}\\ ${^\\star} x$'s in ${^\\star} A$ for all sets $A$ are ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined, we say that the {non-standard analysis}\\ is {{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined}, or that it has {{\\em\\bf} confinement} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$.\n\\end{Def}\n\nIt is clear that for any infinite cardinality ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, and any (standard) map $f:A\\to B$, $f$ maps {non-standard}\\ elements of confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ to {non-standard}\\ elements of confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ (if ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A'$ where $A'\\subset A$ and $|A'|\\le{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, then ${^\\star} f({^\\star} x)\\in{^\\star} f({^\\star} A')$. By Transfer ${^\\star} f({^\\star} A')={^\\star} (f(A'))$ and $|f(A')|\\le{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTherefore if for each set $A$ we define ${^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}:=$ the set of ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$ with confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, we get a functor $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}$. That functor is a {non-standard analysis}. Indeed, for finite sets $F$ every {non-standard}\\ element is standard, thus ${^\\star}$belongs to a standard singleton, hence is of all confinements. Therefore ${^\\star} F_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}={^\\star} F$; for a product $A\\times B$, an $({^\\star} x,{^\\star} y)\\in{^\\star} (A\\times B)={^\\star} A\\times{^\\star} B$ is ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined if and only if both ${^\\star} x$ and ${^\\star} y$ are so. Therefore\n${^\\star} (A\\times B)_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}={^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}\\times{^\\star} B_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}$;\nand for equalizers the required assertion is clear.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe call the {non-standard analysis}\\ $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}$: the {non-standard analysis}\\ $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A$\n{{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined}, or the {{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confinement} of the {non-standard analysis}\\ $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow suppose a {non-standard analysis}\\ is given which has confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, and let $B$ be some set of cardinality ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$. Suppose we know the {lim-rim}\\ $E={^\\star} B$ over $B$ that $A$ induces on $B$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIt seems evident that we can recover the {non-standard}\\ elements ${^\\star} A$ of any set (or class) $A$ using that {lim-rim}. Indeed, since the {non-standard analysis}\\ has confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, any {non-standard}\\ element ${^\\star} x$ of $A$ belongs to a set of the form $f(B)$ for some (standard) $f:B\\to A$, hence, by Transfer, is of the form ${^\\star} x=f(e)$ for some $e\\in E={^\\star} B$. We can take the pair $(f,e)$ as a kind of ``coordinates'' for ${^\\star} x$, and all we need is to determine when two pairs $(f_1,e_1)$\\,\\, $(f_2,e_2)$ define the same ${^\\star} x$ and how ${^\\star} g:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star} A'$, for some $g:A\\to A'$, is expressed using these ``coordinates''. But these characterisations are straightforward, since Transfer must hold. In fact, we use the ``template'' {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$ to define the {non-standard}\\ elements of any set by, in essence, ``carrying'' them over from $B$ in some analogy with the way tangent vectors may be defined in any smooth manifold by ``carrying'' them over from ${\\mathbb{{R}}}^n$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nBy this way we can start from any {lim-rim}\\ $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$ over $B$ and define a $|B|$-confined {non-standard analysis}\\, which will be (equivalent to) the {\\em $|B|$-confinement} of any {non-standard analysis}\\ which induces on $B$ a {lim-rim}\\ isomorphic to $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nStill, we can achieve that goal more ``neatly''.\n\n\\begin{Prop}\\label{Prop:lrna}\nLet $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$ be a {lim-rim}\\ over an infinite set (basis) $B$. For any set $X$, let\n${^\\star} X$ be defined as the ``cylindrical'' ultrapower of $X$ with respect to $B^E$ and ${\\mathcal{L}}$, namely, the set $\\left( X^{B^E}\\right)_c$ of all mappings from $B^E$ to $X$ which depend only on a finite set of coordinates in $B^E$ (that set of coordinates depending on the mapping), factored by the equivalence relation of equivalence modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$. (And the ${^\\star}$ of mappings between sets $f:X\\to Y$ defined by composing with a representant of ${^\\star} x$).\n\nThen: (i) $X\\mapsto{^\\star} X$ is a $|B|$-confined {non-standard analysis}. It is called: the ($|B|$-confined) {non-standard analysis}\\\n{{\\em\\bf} induced by the {lim-rim}}.\n\n(ii) If $X\\mapsto{}{{}^\\star_0} X$ is a $|B|$-confined {non-standard analysis}\\ which induces on $B$ a {lim-rim}\\ isomorphic to $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$, then $X\\mapsto{}{{}^\\star_0} X$ is equivalent to $X\\mapsto{^\\star} X$ via the two following natural mappings:\n\n${\\alpha}={\\alpha}_X:{^\\star} X\\to{}{{}^\\star_0} X$: let $\\phi:B^E\\to X$ be a representant of ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} X$. $\\phi$ depends only on a finite set of coordinates $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$. Hence we may write for $\\psi\\in B^E$, $\\phi(\\psi)=f(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$,\\,\\,$f:B^n\\to X$. We may assume $E={}{{}^\\star_0} B$, and define ${\\alpha}({^\\star} x):=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} X$.\n\n${\\gamma}={\\gamma}_X:{}{{}^\\star_0} X\\to{^\\star} X$: let ${{}^\\star_0} x\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} X$. Since the {non-standard analysis}\\ is $|B|$-confined, there is an $f:B\\to X$ such that ${{}^\\star_0} x\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} \\Big(f(B)\\Big)=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(E)$. Thus ${{}^\\star_0} x=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e)$ for some $e\\in E$. Define ${\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x)$ as $\\psi\\in B^E\\mapsto f(\\psi_e)$ modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$. This does not depend on the choice of $f$.\n\\end{Prop}\n\n\\begin{Prf}\nClearly $X\\mapsto{^\\star} X$ is a functor, and as in Example \\ref{exm:na} one sees that it satisfies (i) and (ii) of Definition \\ref{Def:na}. Therefore it is a {non-standard analysis}. Every ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} X$, with a representant\n$\\phi:B^E\\to X$ depending on the $n$ coordinates $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$,\n$\\phi(\\psi)=f(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$,\n${^\\star}$belongs to $f(B^n)$, of cardinality $\\le|B|$. This proves (i).{\\par\\medskip}\n\n${\\gamma}({{}^\\star_0} x)$ does not depend on the choice of $f$. Indeed, if\n${{}^\\star_0} x=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f_1\\Big)(e_1)=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f_2\\Big)(e_2)$, then $(e_1,e_2)$\\,\\,${{}^\\star_0} $belongs to the set $\\{(b_1,b_2)\\in B\\times B\\,|\\,f_1(b_1)=f_2(b_2)\\}$. This is the ${^\\star}$ of a $2$-relation in $B$, and by the way ${^\\star}$ is defined for a {lim-rim}, this means that for $\\psi\\in B^E$,\\,\\,$(\\psi_{e_1},\\psi_{e_2})$ is in that set modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$, i.e.\\ $f_1(\\psi_{e_1})=f_2(\\psi_{e_2})$ modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$. This means that the two definitions for ${\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x)$ coincide.\n\nClearly ${\\alpha}$ and ${\\gamma}$ are natural mappings.\n\n${\\alpha}\\circ{\\gamma}$ is the identity. Indeed, start from some ${{}^\\star_0} x\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} X$.\n${^\\star} x:={\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x)$ is $\\psi\\in B^E\\mapsto f(\\psi_e)$ modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$, where\n$f:B\\to X$ is such that ${{}^\\star_0} x=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e)$. Thus $\\psi\\in B^E\\mapsto f(\\psi_e)$ is a representant of ${^\\star} x$, and ${\\alpha}({\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x))={\\alpha}({^\\star} x):=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e)={}{{}^\\star_0} x$.\n\n${\\gamma}\\circ{\\alpha}$ is the identity. Indeed, start from some ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} X$ represented by\n$\\phi:B^E\\to X$ which depends on the coordinates $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$, i.e.\\\nfor $\\psi\\in B^E$,\\,\\,$\\phi(\\psi)=f(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$. Then\n${{}^\\star_0} x:={\\alpha}({^\\star} x):=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$.

In his and\nfollowing treatments (see several treatises in the bibliography)\n\\footnote{In another direction, beginning with E.~Nelson \\cite{Nelson}, one\nconstructs a special Set Theory for {non-standard analysis}.}\nthe idea is to start with a ``big'' structure -- a set $V$, with the restriction to it of the membership relation $\\in$, which will be big enough so that usual mathematics could be done in it (should contain, e.g.\\ ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ (the natural numbers), ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ (the real numbers), sets of them, sets of these etc.) $V$ is to be provided with a ``mirror'' ``{non-standard}''\nstructure ${^\\star} V$ with a relation ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$, viewed as an ``interpretation'' of the $\\in$ of $V$ (Also, ``interpret'' ``$=$'' in $V$ by ``$=$'' in ${^\\star} V$), so that\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item\n$V$ is embedded in ${^\\star} V$ -- identified with a subset of ${^\\star} V$. The members of\n$V$ (thus considered as members of ${^\\star} V$) are referred to as {\\em standard}\n(yet by ``{non-standard}'' elements we mean any members of ${^\\star} V$).\n\n\\item\nA {\\em Transfer Principle} holds: any (in some constructions one has to say:\n``bounded'') first-order logical expression with members of $V$ as constants which is a true sentence when quantifiers are interpreted relative to $V$ will remain a true sentence if (the constants -- members of $V$ -- are replaced by their identified images in ${^\\star} V$ and) $\\in$ is replaced by ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$ and the quantifiers are interpreted relative to ${^\\star} V$. In this sense ${^\\star} V$ is a model to the true in $V$ sentences of the first-order theory with $\\in$ and all elements of $V$ as constants.\n\n\\item\nBy Transfer, for any standard set $A$, a standard $a\\in V$ will be an ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-member of it if and only if it is a usual member, but in ${^\\star} V$\\,\\,$A$ may have other, {\\em{non-standard}} members. The set of all elements of ${^\\star} V$ which ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-belong to $A$ is denoted by ${^\\star} A$. Again by Transfer, ${^\\star} (A\\times B)$ is canonically identified with ${^\\star} A\\times\\,{^\\star} B$, thus for relations, functions etc.\\ we have the ${^\\star}$-relation, ${^\\star}$-function etc.\\ among members of ${^\\star} V$ (which for standard elements coincides with the original relation, function\netc.) When there is no danger of misunderstanding, one often uses the same\nsymbol (e.g.\\ $+$, $<$) for the ${^\\star}$-relation etc.\\ as for the original.\n\n\\item\n${^\\star} V$ is indeed ``{non-standard}'' -- it contains elements not in $V$, and one has features, usually some kind of ``saturation'' (see below), which will ensure, say, that there is an ${^\\star} n\\in{^\\star} V$ which ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-belongs to the set ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ of natural numbers, but such that for every standard $m\\in N$,\\,\\,$m\\;{{^\\star}\\!\\!}<{^\\star} n$ (i.e.\\ $(m,{^\\star} n)$ ${{^\\star}\\!\\!}\\in$-belongs to the graph of $<$). Such ${^\\star} n$'s are naturally referred to as\n``infinite'' or ``unlimited''\n\\footnote{In fact, as in footnote \\ref{f:i}, for ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ the existence of ``infinite'' members needs only the existence of some not standard members -- one easily proves using Transfer that all ${^\\star}$-members of a finite standard $A$ are standard, hence any ${^\\star}$-member of ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ which is not standard is automatically bigger than all standard\nnumbers.}\nand by Transfer they have reciprocals in ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, referred to as ``infinitesimal''.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe ``philosophy'' here is to develop the theory from these properties, paying\nless attention to the way such ${^\\star} V$ is constructed (or proved to exist).\nThe usual construction is by an ultrapower or a modification of it.\nAnyway, one has to have a set $V$ to make the construction, hence only\nsubsets of it will have {non-standard}\\ members.\n{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\subsection{Ultrafilters of {Non-Standard}\\ Elements}\nLet us be given a {non-standard analysis}, {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}. For any set $A$, and any\n${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$, and for any $S\\subset A$, we have ${^\\star} S\\subset{^\\star} A$, thus either\n${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} S$ or ${^\\star} x$ is not in ${^\\star} S$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ it is in the complement\n${{^\\star}}A\\setminus{^\\star} S={^\\star} (A\\setminus S)$. Put otherwise: for any ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$-valued predicate\n$f:A\\to{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$ we have ${^\\star} f:{}{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star}{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}={\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$ and ${^\\star} f({^\\star} x)$ is either ${\\textbf{True}}$ or ${\\textbf{False}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nHence any ${^\\star} x\\in{}{^\\star} A$ induces a map ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}^A\\to{\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$, which is easily seen to be a Boolean-algebra homomorphism, i.e.\\ an ultrafilter in $A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIn fact, we may replace ${\\{{\\textbf{True}},{\\textbf{False}}\\}}$ by any other finite set $F$, and view the set ${\\beta} A$ of the ultrafilters in $A$ as the set of natural mappings between the functor from ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$ to ${\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$\\,\\,$F\\mapsto F^A={\\text{Hom}}(A,F)$, and the inclusion functor ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}\\to{\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThen to a ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$ corresponds the ultrafilter: the mapping $[f\\mapsto{^\\star} f({^\\star} x)]:{\\text{Hom}}(A,F)\\to F$. This is clearly a natural mapping between the functors $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A$ and $A\\mapsto{\\beta} A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNote, that although the functor $A\\mapsto{\\beta} A$ is a canonically defined functor on sets, which maps injections to injections, it does not preserve finite products (hence is not a {non-standard analysis}\\ {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}). The projections $A\\times B\\to A$ and $A\\times B\\to B$ define onto mappings ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} A$ and ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} B$, hence induce a ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} A\\times{\\beta} B$, which is also onto, but is usually not one-to-one. Thus this functor does not satisfy (ii) of Definition \\ref{Def:na} (while it satisfies (i)).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nOne may view a {non-standard analysis}\\ as a quest to extend sets by adjoining all (or some) possible limits. This in close analogy in spirit to extending a field to its algebraic closure by adjoining all possible roots of algebraic equations. In the latter case one would like to simply define the adjoined elements as labeled by the irreducible polynomial they satisfy, but that is hampered by such facts as the polynomial whose roots are the sums of the roots of two irreducible polynomials being not irreducible.\n\\footnote{Which may be viewed as the ``reason'' for the existence of several\nconjugate roots: the polynomial $d(t)$ whose roots are the differences of the\nroots of the irreducible $f(t)$ has a factor $t$ but also other irreducible\nfactors, testifying to differences $\\ne0$.}\nThe algebraic closure thus contains conjugate elements with the same irreducible polynomial and for any such elements there is an automorphism of the algebraic closure exchanging them.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nSimilarly in our case we would like to label the adjoined ``{non-standard}\\ elements'' by\nthe ultrafilters on the original set. After all, these ultrafilters (and ultrafilters in finite products of sets) give all the possible ways properties (and relations) can conceivably hold or not. But that would not work precisely because the functor ${\\beta}$ does not preserve finite products. There is a naturally defined Cartesian product of filters, but the Cartesian product of two ultrafilters ${\\mathcal{U}}\\in{\\beta} A,{\\mathcal{V}}\\in{\\beta} B$ is in general not an ultrafilter -- it is the intersection of all ultrafilters in $A\\times B$ that map to $({\\mathcal{U}},{\\mathcal{V}})$ in the above mapping ${\\beta}(A\\times B)\\to{\\beta} A\\times{\\beta} B$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe too will have a construction (\\S\\ref{S:car}) where there will be ``conjugate'' {non-standard}\\ elements with the same ultrafilter and any such conjugate elements will be exchangeable by an automorphism, provided one has enough General Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), and then, in the same spirit as with algebraic closures, one has uniqueness (for fixed ``basis'' $B$ -- see below) up to isomorphism, and also universality and homogeneity.\n{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\n\\subsection{{Lim-Rim} s -- Local {Non-Standard Analysis}}\nGiven a {non-standard analysis}, one may focus on a particular set $B$ and try to extract what the {non-standard analysis}\\ says about this $B$ (hence about its subsets).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThe information telling which {non-standard}\\ elements satisfy which relations is encoded in the ultrafilters on $B^I$,\\,$I$ finite. The {non-standard analysis}\\ gives us a natural mapping $({^\\star} B)^I\\to{\\beta}(B^I)$ between these two (contravariant) functors on $I$ from ${\\mathcal{F}}{\\mathcal{I}}{\\mathcal{N}}$ to ${\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$. If for any set $I\\in{\\mathcal{S}}{\\mathcal{E}}{\\mathcal{T}}$ we will define ${\\beta}_c(A^I)$ as the set of ultrafilters on the {\\em cylinder Boolean algebra of $B^I$} (the members of the cylinder Boolean algebra are the subsets of $B^I$ that depend only on a finite number of coordinates. In case $I$ is finite this is just the power set of $B^I$), then any natural $({^\\star} B)^I\\to{\\beta}(B^I)$ on the finite sets $I$ extends in a unique way to a natural $({^\\star} B)^I\\to{\\beta}_c(B^I)$ on all sets $I$. Moreover, we can take $I={^\\star} B$ itself and then the image by the natural mapping of any element of $({^\\star} B)^I$ will be known if we know the image in ${\\beta}_c\\left( B^{{}{{^\\star}}B}\\right)$ of the identity family $\\in({^\\star} B)^{{^\\star} B}$.\n\n\\begin{Def}\nWe say that a set $E$ has the structure of a {{\\em\\bf}{lim-rim}} over a set\n\\footnote{we shall usually have $B$ infinite.}\n(basis) $B$ if either of the equivalent following is given. (i) An  ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}$ on the cylinder Boolean algebra of $B^E$, which will be referred to as the {{\\em\\bf} defining cylinder ultrafilter} of the {lim-rim}\\ (then we shall also speak of the {lim-rim}\\ $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$ over $B$). (ii) A natural mapping between the (contravariant) functors on sets $I$: $E^I$ and ${\\beta}_c(B^I)$, where the latter denotes the set of ultrafilters in the cylinder Boolean algebra. It will be referred to as the {{\\em\\bf} defining natural mapping} of the {lim-rim}. (Note that these functors and the natural mapping are defined for any $I$, yet they are determined by giving them for the finite $I$.)\n\\end{Def}\n\nHere, the defining cylinder ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}$ in $B^E$ can be recovered as the image, by the natural mapping, in ${\\beta}_c\\left( B^E\\right)$, of the identity family in $E^E$. On the other hand, if ${\\mathcal{L}}$ is given, what it does is deciding, for any (finite) family $\\eta\\in E^I$ indexed by a finite $I$ (pushing ${\\mathcal{L}}$, using the map $B^E\\to B^I$ induced by $\\eta:I\\to E$, to\nan ultrafilter in $B^I$) whether relations -- subsets of $B^I$ -- hold or\nnot, thus transferring such $I$-relations in $B$ (= subsets of $B^I$) into\n$I$-relations in $E$, as a {non-standard}\\ setting should. This new $I$-relation in $E$ will be referred to as the {\\em transfer} or ${^\\star}$ of the original $I$-relation in $B$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo put it otherwise: for an $n$-tuple $(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$ of elements of $E$, a\nrelation $R\\subset B^n$\\,\\,${^\\star}$-holds for $(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$ if and only if for $\\psi\\in B^E$,\n$(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})\\in R$ holds modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo conclude:{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\begin{Prop}\nGiven a {non-standard analysis}\\ {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}, it induces on any set $B$ a {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$, where $E={^\\star} B$.\n\\end{Prop}\nAnd as said above, this {lim-rim}\\ captures which relations about $B$, or its subsets, are satisfied by $n$-tuples of {non-standard}\\ elements $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$. We may say that a {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$ defines a ``local'' {non-standard analysis}, with $E$ the set of {non-standard}\\ elements of $B$, completely satisfactory as a {non-standard analysis}\\ as long as one restricts oneself only to $B$ or its subsets.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\begin{Rmk}\nThere can be sub-{lim-rim} s of a {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$ in two ways (or both combined):\nFirstly, any subset $E'\\subset E$ has the structure of a {lim-rim}\\ over $B$,\nand secondly for any $B'\\subset B$ the set ${^\\star} B'$ of the $e\\in E$ that satisfy\nthe ${^\\star} $ of `` belongs to $B'$ '' forms a {lim-rim}\\ over $B'$. Instead of\ntalking about sub-{lim-rim} s one may talk about embeddings. Isomorphisms and\nautomorphisms of {lim-rim} s are defined as expected (as those which respect the\nultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}$).\n\\end{Rmk}\n{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\subsection{Confined {Non-Standard Analysis}, Separated and Rectified {Lim-Rim} s}\n\\begin{Def}\nLet ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ be an infinite cardinality. Given a {non-standard analysis}\\ {as per Definition \\ref{Def:na}}, let $A$ be a set and ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$. We say that ${^\\star} x$ is {{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined} or has {{\\em\\bf} confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$} if there exists a (standard) set $A'\\subset A$ of cardinality $\\le{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ such that ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A'$. If ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ is a cardinality such that all {non-standard}\\ ${^\\star} x$'s in ${^\\star} A$ for all sets $A$ are ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined, we say that the {non-standard analysis}\\ is {{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined}, or that it has {{\\em\\bf} confinement} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$.\n\\end{Def}\n\nIt is clear that for any infinite cardinality ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, and any (standard) map $f:A\\to B$, $f$ maps {non-standard}\\ elements of confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ to {non-standard}\\ elements of confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ (if ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A'$ where $A'\\subset A$ and $|A'|\\le{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, then ${^\\star} f({^\\star} x)\\in{^\\star} f({^\\star} A')$. By Transfer ${^\\star} f({^\\star} A')={^\\star} (f(A'))$ and $|f(A')|\\le{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$).{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTherefore if for each set $A$ we define ${^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}:=$ the set of ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} A$ with confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, we get a functor $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}$. That functor is a {non-standard analysis}. Indeed, for finite sets $F$ every {non-standard}\\ element is standard, thus ${^\\star}$belongs to a standard singleton, hence is of all confinements. Therefore ${^\\star} F_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}={^\\star} F$; for a product $A\\times B$, an $({^\\star} x,{^\\star} y)\\in{^\\star} (A\\times B)={^\\star} A\\times{^\\star} B$ is ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined if and only if both ${^\\star} x$ and ${^\\star} y$ are so. Therefore\n${^\\star} (A\\times B)_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}={^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}\\times{^\\star} B_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}$;\nand for equalizers the required assertion is clear.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe call the {non-standard analysis}\\ $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A_{{\\mathfrak{{m}}}}$: the {non-standard analysis}\\ $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A$\n{{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined}, or the {{\\em\\bf} ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confinement} of the {non-standard analysis}\\ $A\\mapsto{^\\star} A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow suppose a {non-standard analysis}\\ is given which has confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, and let $B$ be some set of cardinality ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$. Suppose we know the {lim-rim}\\ $E={^\\star} B$ over $B$ that $A$ induces on $B$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIt seems evident that we can recover the {non-standard}\\ elements ${^\\star} A$ of any set (or class) $A$ using that {lim-rim}. Indeed, since the {non-standard analysis}\\ has confinement ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$, any {non-standard}\\ element ${^\\star} x$ of $A$ belongs to a set of the form $f(B)$ for some (standard) $f:B\\to A$, hence, by Transfer, is of the form ${^\\star} x=f(e)$ for some $e\\in E={^\\star} B$. We can take the pair $(f,e)$ as a kind of ``coordinates'' for ${^\\star} x$, and all we need is to determine when two pairs $(f_1,e_1)$\\,\\, $(f_2,e_2)$ define the same ${^\\star} x$ and how ${^\\star} g:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star} A'$, for some $g:A\\to A'$, is expressed using these ``coordinates''. But these characterisations are straightforward, since Transfer must hold. In fact, we use the ``template'' {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$ to define the {non-standard}\\ elements of any set by, in essence, ``carrying'' them over from $B$ in some analogy with the way tangent vectors may be defined in any smooth manifold by ``carrying'' them over from ${\\mathbb{{R}}}^n$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nBy this way we can start from any {lim-rim}\\ $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$ over $B$ and define a $|B|$-confined {non-standard analysis}\\, which will be (equivalent to) the {\\em $|B|$-confinement} of any {non-standard analysis}\\ which induces on $B$ a {lim-rim}\\ isomorphic to $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nStill, we can achieve that goal more ``neatly''.\n\n\\begin{Prop}\\label{Prop:lrna}\nLet $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$ be a {lim-rim}\\ over an infinite set (basis) $B$. For any set $X$, let\n${^\\star} X$ be defined as the ``cylindrical'' ultrapower of $X$ with respect to $B^E$ and ${\\mathcal{L}}$, namely, the set $\\left( X^{B^E}\\right)_c$ of all mappings from $B^E$ to $X$ which depend only on a finite set of coordinates in $B^E$ (that set of coordinates depending on the mapping), factored by the equivalence relation of equivalence modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$. (And the ${^\\star}$ of mappings between sets $f:X\\to Y$ defined by composing with a representant of ${^\\star} x$).\n\nThen: (i) $X\\mapsto{^\\star} X$ is a $|B|$-confined {non-standard analysis}. It is called: the ($|B|$-confined) {non-standard analysis}\\\n{{\\em\\bf} induced by the {lim-rim}}.\n\n(ii) If $X\\mapsto{}{{}^\\star_0} X$ is a $|B|$-confined {non-standard analysis}\\ which induces on $B$ a {lim-rim}\\ isomorphic to $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$, then $X\\mapsto{}{{}^\\star_0} X$ is equivalent to $X\\mapsto{^\\star} X$ via the two following natural mappings:\n\n${\\alpha}={\\alpha}_X:{^\\star} X\\to{}{{}^\\star_0} X$: let $\\phi:B^E\\to X$ be a representant of ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} X$. $\\phi$ depends only on a finite set of coordinates $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$. Hence we may write for $\\psi\\in B^E$, $\\phi(\\psi)=f(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$,\\,\\,$f:B^n\\to X$. We may assume $E={}{{}^\\star_0} B$, and define ${\\alpha}({^\\star} x):=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} X$.\n\n${\\gamma}={\\gamma}_X:{}{{}^\\star_0} X\\to{^\\star} X$: let ${{}^\\star_0} x\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} X$. Since the {non-standard analysis}\\ is $|B|$-confined, there is an $f:B\\to X$ such that ${{}^\\star_0} x\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} \\Big(f(B)\\Big)=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(E)$. Thus ${{}^\\star_0} x=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e)$ for some $e\\in E$. Define ${\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x)$ as $\\psi\\in B^E\\mapsto f(\\psi_e)$ modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$. This does not depend on the choice of $f$.\n\\end{Prop}\n\n\\begin{Prf}\nClearly $X\\mapsto{^\\star} X$ is a functor, and as in Example \\ref{exm:na} one sees that it satisfies (i) and (ii) of Definition \\ref{Def:na}. Therefore it is a {non-standard analysis}. Every ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} X$, with a representant\n$\\phi:B^E\\to X$ depending on the $n$ coordinates $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$,\n$\\phi(\\psi)=f(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$,\n${^\\star}$belongs to $f(B^n)$, of cardinality $\\le|B|$. This proves (i).{\\par\\medskip}\n\n${\\gamma}({{}^\\star_0} x)$ does not depend on the choice of $f$. Indeed, if\n${{}^\\star_0} x=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f_1\\Big)(e_1)=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f_2\\Big)(e_2)$, then $(e_1,e_2)$\\,\\,${{}^\\star_0} $belongs to the set $\\{(b_1,b_2)\\in B\\times B\\,|\\,f_1(b_1)=f_2(b_2)\\}$. This is the ${^\\star}$ of a $2$-relation in $B$, and by the way ${^\\star}$ is defined for a {lim-rim}, this means that for $\\psi\\in B^E$,\\,\\,$(\\psi_{e_1},\\psi_{e_2})$ is in that set modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$, i.e.\\ $f_1(\\psi_{e_1})=f_2(\\psi_{e_2})$ modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$. This means that the two definitions for ${\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x)$ coincide.\n\nClearly ${\\alpha}$ and ${\\gamma}$ are natural mappings.\n\n${\\alpha}\\circ{\\gamma}$ is the identity. Indeed, start from some ${{}^\\star_0} x\\in{}{{}^\\star_0} X$.\n${^\\star} x:={\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x)$ is $\\psi\\in B^E\\mapsto f(\\psi_e)$ modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$, where\n$f:B\\to X$ is such that ${{}^\\star_0} x=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e)$. Thus $\\psi\\in B^E\\mapsto f(\\psi_e)$ is a representant of ${^\\star} x$, and ${\\alpha}({\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x))={\\alpha}({^\\star} x):=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e)={}{{}^\\star_0} x$.\n\n${\\gamma}\\circ{\\alpha}$ is the identity. Indeed, start from some ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} X$ represented by\n$\\phi:B^E\\to X$ which depends on the coordinates $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$, i.e.\\\nfor $\\psi\\in B^E$,\\,\\,$\\phi(\\psi)=f(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$. Then\n${{}^\\star_0} x:={\\alpha}({^\\star} x):=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} f\\Big)(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$. But by the $|B|$-confinement there are $g:B\\to X$ and $e\\in E$ such that\n${{}^\\star_0} x=\\Big({}{{}^\\star_0} g\\Big)(e)$. Then $(e,e_1,\\ldots,e_n)$\\,\\,${{}^\\star_0} $belongs to the set\n$\\{(b,b_1,\\ldots,b_n)\\in B^{n+1}\\,|\\,g(e)=f(e_1,\\ldots,e_n)\\}$, meaning that for\n$\\psi\\in B^E$,\\,\\,$(\\psi_e,\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$ is in that set modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$,\ni.e.\\ $g(\\psi_e)=f(\\psi_{e_1},\\ldots,\\psi_{e_n})$ modulo ${\\mathcal{L}}$. Thus, ${^\\star} x$ is represented also by $\\psi\\mapsto g(\\psi_e)$, hence ${^\\star} x={\\gamma}({}{{}^\\star_0} x)={\\gamma}({\\alpha}({^\\star} x))$.\n\\end{Prf}\n\n\\begin{Cor}\\label{Cor:lrna}\nLet $(E,{\\mathcal{L}})$ be a {lim-rim}\\ over an infinite $B$.

His requirement that the {non-standard analysis}\\ be an {\\em enlargement} can be phrased, on the level of {lim-rim} s, as the requirement that for any ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{U}}$ on $B$ (or also on $B^I$,\\,\\,$I$ finite) there will be an element ${^\\star} x\\in{^\\star} B$ (or in $({^\\star} B)^I$) which is mapped to ${\\mathcal{U}}$ by the natural mapping that defines the {lim-rim}. But one may require slightly more:\n\n\\begin{Def}\\label{Def:ex}\nA {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over an infinite $B$ is called {{\\em\\bf} exact} if for any finite $I$, $J$ and\nfor any $\\xi:I\\to J$,\\,\\,the diagram expressing the naturality of the natural mapping between the (contravariant) functors $\\bullet\\to E^\\bullet$ and ${\\beta}(B^\\bullet)$ which defines the {lim-rim}, is ``exact'', in the sense that a member of $E^I$ and a member of ${\\beta}(B^J)$ which map to the same member of ${\\beta}(B^I)$ both come from some same member of $E^J$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNote, that for this to hold it suffices that it holds for inclusions ``adding one element'' $I\\to I\\cup\\{i\\}$ \\NOT{guaranteeing that the transfer of relations commutes with\nprojections $B^{I\\cup\\{i\\}}\\to B^I$} and for the map $\\{1,2\\}\\to\\{1\\}$\n(the latter guarantees, as easily seen, that the ${^\\star}$ of the relation of equality in $B$ will be the relation of equality in $E$ -- i.e.\\ that $E$ be separated).\n\\end{Def}\n\nNote that for $I=\\emptyset$ both $E^\\emptyset$ and ${\\beta}(B^\\emptyset)$ are singletons, $\\{\\emptyset\\}$ if you wish, with subsets naturally viewed as the truth-values ${\\textbf{True}}=\\{\\emptyset\\},{\\textbf{False}}=\\emptyset$ which the natural mapping always preserves.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIf $E$ is exact then, in particular, applying the exactness of the diagram for the map $\\emptyset\\to\\{1\\}$ (or $\\emptyset\\to I$,\\,\\,$I$ finite) we have that for every ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{U}}$ in $B$ there is an element $e\\in E$ whose ultrafilter, i.e.\\ whose image in the natural mapping $E\\to{\\beta} B$, is ${\\mathcal{U}}$, that is, $e$ ${^\\star}$belongs to all members of ${\\mathcal{U}}$ (and of course does not ${^\\star}$belong to non-members of ${\\mathcal{U}}$, which are the complements of members).\n\\footnote{This does not hold, in general, for {non-standard analysis}\\ constructed by an ultrapower\n(if the power in the ultrapower is countable, a countable set will have only\n$2^{\\aleph_0}$ {non-standard}\\ members but has $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$ ultrafilters.)}\nIf ${\\mathcal{U}}$ is fixed (principal) -- is the family of all subsets containing\nsome $a\\in B$ -- than $e$ is unique and is the element of $E$ to be identified with $a$ (i.e.\\ $e=\\nu(a)$). If ${\\mathcal{U}}$ is free (non-principal), however, one proves that (if $E$ is exact) $e$ is never unique and we have ``conjugate'' {non-standard}\\ elements with the same ultrafilter which, as we shall see below, will be exchangeable by an automorphism with\na favorable choice of the {lim-rim}.\n{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\begin{rmk}\\label{rmk:Ii}\nWe may express the exactness of the diagram for a map $I\\to I\\cup\\{i\\}$ as follows:\nFor every family $\\eta:I\\to E$ of elements of $E$, and any ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{U}}$\nin $B^{I\\cup\\{i\\}}$ which projects on $B^I$ to the ultrafilter pulled-back from ${\\mathcal{L}}$ by $\\eta$, one can find an element of $E$ as the image of $i$ so that the pull-back of ${\\mathcal{L}}$ by the extended $\\eta$ will be ${\\mathcal{U}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\\end{rmk}\n\nThis implies that for exact {lim-rim} s, ${^\\star}$ of relations will commute with projections $B^{I\\cup\\{i\\}}\\to B^I$ ($i\\notin I$), i.e.\\ with applying $\\exists$.

Therefore we may identify ${^\\star} B=E$.\n\nLet us be given a family of cardinality $<{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ of internal subsets of the ${^\\star}$ of some standard set $C$, where every finite subfamily has non-empty intersection.\n\nEvery member of the family of internal sets is the scope ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}$ of some ${^\\star} X_\\iota\\in{^\\star}{\\mathcal{P}} C$, and, the {non-standard analysis}\\ being $|B|$-confined, there is a standard subset $Y_\\iota\\subset{\\mathcal{P}} C$ of cardinality $\\le|B|$ such that ${^\\star} X\\in{^\\star} Y_\\iota$. Denoting by $R_\\iota$ the relation $\\in$ in $C\\times Y_\\iota$, ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}$ is the section parallel to ${^\\star} C$ of ${^\\star} R_\\iota$ through ${^\\star} X_\\iota$. As $|Y_\\iota|\\le|B|$, we may\nreplace the $Y_\\iota$'s with subsets of $B$, shifting the $R_\\iota$'s accordingly.\nThen the ${^\\star} X_\\iota$'s belong to $E={^\\star} B$, and they form an element of $E^I$ for the\nset $I$ of the $\\iota$'s, where $|I|<{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$.\n\nNow we distinguish between the two cases. If $|C|\\le|B|$, we may assume $C\\subset B$.\nIf we do not have $|C|\\le|B|$, replace ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ by $\\min({\\mathfrak{{m}}},|B|^+)$, that is, assume\n${\\mathfrak{{m}}}\\le|B|^+$. Then the cardinality of the family of internal sets is $\\le|B|$ and if we pick an element from every intersection of a finite subfamily, we get at most $|B|$ elements which, by $|B|$-confinement, all belong to some ${^\\star} C'$ for some (standard) $C'\\subset C$ with $|C'|\\le|B|$. And we proceed with ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}\\cap{^\\star} C'$ instead of ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}$ as in the first case.\n\nSo we assume $C\\subset B$; writing $B=B^{\\{0\\}}$, every $R_\\iota$ is a relation $=$ subset of $B^{\\{0,\\iota\\}}$. Which can be viewed as a ``cylinder'' in $B^{\\{0\\}\\cup I}$. We wish to have an ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{U}}$ in the cylinders of $B^{\\{0\\}\\cup I}$ which contains these $R_\\iota$'s and also all sets which depend only on a finite number of coordinates {\\em in $I$}, that the ${^\\star} X_\\iota$ satisfy. The fact that ${\\mathcal{U}}$ exists, i.e.\\ that any finite number of these intersect, follows from the fact that their ${^\\star}$ intersect because any finite subfamily of the ${^\\star} R_\\iota[{^\\star} X_\\iota]$ intersects. Now, ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-exactness finishes the task: it says that there is a ${^\\star} X_0\\in E$ such that the push of ${\\mathcal{L}}$ to $B^{\\{0\\}\\cup I}$ is ${\\mathcal{U}}$, that is, the family $({^\\star} X_0,({^\\star} X_\\iota))$ ${^\\star}$belongs to all members of ${\\mathcal{U}}$, meaning that ${^\\star} X_0$ is in the intersection of all the members of the family of internal sets.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n(ii) Denote $E={^\\star} B$. Let $I$ be such that $|I|={\\mathfrak{{m}}}'<{\\mathfrak{{m}}}_1$, let $\\eta:I\\to E$ be a family of elements of $E$, and ${\\mathcal{U}}$ an ultrafilter in the cylinders of $B^{I\\cup\\{0\\}}$ which projects on $B^I$ to the ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{U}}'$ pulled-back from ${\\mathcal{L}}$ by $\\eta$, and one wishes to find an element of $E$ as $\\eta(0)$ -- the image of $0$, so that the pull-back of ${\\mathcal{L}}$ by the extended $\\eta$ will be ${\\mathcal{U}}$.\n\nTo satisfy this, $\\eta(0)$, together with the $\\eta(\\iota),\\iota\\in I$, must ${^\\star}$belong to all the members $U$ of ${\\mathcal{U}}$. Belonging to each such $U$ requires $\\eta(0)$ to belong to a certain internal subset of ${^\\star} B=E$.

Therefore we may identify ${^\\star} B=E$.\n\nLet us be given a family of cardinality $<{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ of internal subsets of the ${^\\star}$ of some standard set $C$, where every finite subfamily has non-empty intersection.\n\nEvery member of the family of internal sets is the scope ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}$ of some ${^\\star} X_\\iota\\in{^\\star}{\\mathcal{P}} C$, and, the {non-standard analysis}\\ being $|B|$-confined, there is a standard subset $Y_\\iota\\subset{\\mathcal{P}} C$ of cardinality $\\le|B|$ such that ${^\\star} X\\in{^\\star} Y_\\iota$. Denoting by $R_\\iota$ the relation $\\in$ in $C\\times Y_\\iota$, ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}$ is the section parallel to ${^\\star} C$ of ${^\\star} R_\\iota$ through ${^\\star} X_\\iota$. As $|Y_\\iota|\\le|B|$, we may\nreplace the $Y_\\iota$'s with subsets of $B$, shifting the $R_\\iota$'s accordingly.\nThen the ${^\\star} X_\\iota$'s belong to $E={^\\star} B$, and they form an element of $E^I$ for the\nset $I$ of the $\\iota$'s, where $|I|<{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$.\n\nNow we distinguish between the two cases. If $|C|\\le|B|$, we may assume $C\\subset B$.\nIf we do not have $|C|\\le|B|$, replace ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$ by $\\min({\\mathfrak{{m}}},|B|^+)$, that is, assume\n${\\mathfrak{{m}}}\\le|B|^+$. Then the cardinality of the family of internal sets is $\\le|B|$ and if we pick an element from every intersection of a finite subfamily, we get at most $|B|$ elements which, by $|B|$-confinement, all belong to some ${^\\star} C'$ for some (standard) $C'\\subset C$ with $|C'|\\le|B|$. And we proceed with ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}\\cap{^\\star} C'$ instead of ${{\\buildrel{\\,\\,\\wedge}\\over{{{^\\star} X_\\iota}}}\\!}$ as in the first case.\n\nSo we assume $C\\subset B$; writing $B=B^{\\{0\\}}$, every $R_\\iota$ is a relation $=$ subset of $B^{\\{0,\\iota\\}}$. Which can be viewed as a ``cylinder'' in $B^{\\{0\\}\\cup I}$. We wish to have an ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{U}}$ in the cylinders of $B^{\\{0\\}\\cup I}$ which contains these $R_\\iota$'s and also all sets which depend only on a finite number of coordinates {\\em in $I$}, that the ${^\\star} X_\\iota$ satisfy. The fact that ${\\mathcal{U}}$ exists, i.e.\\ that any finite number of these intersect, follows from the fact that their ${^\\star}$ intersect because any finite subfamily of the ${^\\star} R_\\iota[{^\\star} X_\\iota]$ intersects. Now, ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-exactness finishes the task: it says that there is a ${^\\star} X_0\\in E$ such that the push of ${\\mathcal{L}}$ to $B^{\\{0\\}\\cup I}$ is ${\\mathcal{U}}$, that is, the family $({^\\star} X_0,({^\\star} X_\\iota))$ ${^\\star}$belongs to all members of ${\\mathcal{U}}$, meaning that ${^\\star} X_0$ is in the intersection of all the members of the family of internal sets.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n(ii) Denote $E={^\\star} B$. Let $I$ be such that $|I|={\\mathfrak{{m}}}'<{\\mathfrak{{m}}}_1$, let $\\eta:I\\to E$ be a family of elements of $E$, and ${\\mathcal{U}}$ an ultrafilter in the cylinders of $B^{I\\cup\\{0\\}}$ which projects on $B^I$ to the ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{U}}'$ pulled-back from ${\\mathcal{L}}$ by $\\eta$, and one wishes to find an element of $E$ as $\\eta(0)$ -- the image of $0$, so that the pull-back of ${\\mathcal{L}}$ by the extended $\\eta$ will be ${\\mathcal{U}}$.\n\nTo satisfy this, $\\eta(0)$, together with the $\\eta(\\iota),\\iota\\in I$, must ${^\\star}$belong to all the members $U$ of ${\\mathcal{U}}$. Belonging to each such $U$ requires $\\eta(0)$ to belong to a certain internal subset of ${^\\star} B=E$. To belong to any finite number of these internal subsets, is to satisfy the conjunction of these ${^\\star} U$'s with a finite number of $\\eta(\\iota)$'s, $\\eta_{\\iota_1},\\ldots,\\eta_{\\iota_n}$ as parameters. The set of these parameters belongs to the ${^\\star}$ of a any member $U'$ of ${\\mathcal{U}}'$. Hence, Transfer will tell us that there is such an $\\eta(0)$, if we can find a member $U'$ of ${\\mathcal{U}}'$ so that for any ``standard'' ``parameters'' $b_{\\iota_1},\\ldots,b_{\\iota_n}\\,\\in B$ there is a $b_{\\iota_0}\\in B$ which together with them belong to all the (finite number of) $U$'s. But for this just take as $U'$ the projection on $B^I$ of the intersection of these $U$'s.\n\nThus, every finite number of these internal subsets intersect.\n\nAlso, the cardinality of ${\\mathcal{U}}$ is at most the cardinality of the set of all ``cylinders'' in $B^I$, which is $\\le 2^{|B|}\\cdot{\\mathfrak{{m}}}'<{\\mathfrak{{m}}}$.\n\nHence, by saturation, all requirements for $\\eta(0)$ can be fulfilled.\n\\end{Prf}\n\n\\subsection{Regular {Lim-Rim} s, {Lim-Rim} s with Homogeneity and Universality}\n\\begin{Def}\nA {lim-rim}\\ $E$ over $B$ is called {{\\em\\bf} regular} if it is $|E|$-exact.\n\\end{Def}\n\nA regular {lim-rim}\\ is {\\em universal}, in the sense that any embedding in $E$ of a sub-{lim-rim}\\ $M'$ of cardinality $<|E|$ of a separated {lim-rim}\\ $M$ over $B$ of cardinality $|M|\\le|E|$ can be extended to an embedding of all $M$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIndeed, the embedding of $M'$ can be viewed as a family of elements of $E$ so that the pull-back of the defining cylinder ulterafilter in $B^E$ is the defining cylinder ultrafilter in $B^{M'}$, which is the projection of the defining cylinder ultrafilter in $B^M$, and one uses Remark \\ref{rmk:M}.

To this end we appropriately choose the ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}$ in the cylinders of $B^{E'\\cup\\{e\\}}$, of course one that projects on $B^{E'}$ to the previously constructed ${\\mathcal{L}}$.\n\nFor any $\\iota\\in\\Omega$, supposing we already have $E_\\iota$ and ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\iota$, we shall take care simultaneously of all possible $\\eta$ into $E'=E_\\iota$ and ${\\mathcal{U}}$'s, adding one $e$ for each of them, to get $E_{\\iota+1}$. If we assume as an induction hypothesis that $|E_\\iota|\\le2^{2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}}$, then there are at most\n$\\left( 2^{2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}}\\right)^{2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}}=2^{2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}}$ such $\\eta$'s, and for each $I\\subset 2^B$ the cardinality of the cylinder Boolean algebra of\n$B^I$ is $|I|\\cdot2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}\\le2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}$, hence the cardinality of all possible cylinder ultrafilters, these being subsets of this Boolean algebra, is $\\le2^{2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}}$.

Clearly we will preserve the fact $|E_\\iota|\\le2^{2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}}$.\n\nThe final $E$ will be $E_\\Omega$, after we had made it {\\em separated} by taking its factor set with respect to the equivalence relation on $e_1,e_2$: $\\{\\psi\\,|\\,\\psi_{e_1}=\\psi_{e_2}\\}\\in{\\mathcal{L}}$.\n(i) will be satisfied. (By the above $|E|\\le2^{2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}}$. the inverse inequality is Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:ExactCar}).\n(ii) will be satisfied too, since every $\\eta$ for $E_\\Omega$ concerns at most $2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}$ elements $e$, constructed at $2^{\\mathfrak{{b}}}$ $\\iota$'s, the set of these $\\iota$'s is bounded in $\\Omega$ by some $\\iota'$, and this $\\eta$ has been dealt with -- received its $\\eta(0)$ -- already in $E_{\\iota'}$.\n\nWe still have to prove that we can construct the cylinder ultrafilter ${\\mathcal{L}}_{\\iota+1}$ when we construct $E_{\\iota+1}$ above. ${\\mathcal{L}}_{\\iota+1}$ must: (a) Project to ${\\mathcal{L}}_\\iota$ on\n$B^{E_\\iota}$.

For every set $A$, we have ${^\\star} A$, but, of course, ${^\\star} A$ being again a set, we have ${^\\star}{^\\star} A$, also ${^\\star}{^\\star}{^\\star} A$ etc. The {non-standard analysis}\\ defines, for every set $A$, an injection $\\nu:A\\to{^\\star} A$ mapping $a\\in A\\mapsto\\nu(a)\\in{^\\star} A$. Therefore we have (again an injection, by Transfer) ${^\\star}\\nu:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star}{^\\star} A$. Note that we still have $\\nu:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star}{^\\star} A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nBoth $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$ are injective. Thus both ``embed'' ${^\\star} A$ in ${^\\star}{^\\star} A$. Yet they are highly different, as we shall see.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n$\\nu$, of course, satisfies Transfer. But by Transferring Transfer we find that also ${^\\star}\\nu$ satisfies a kind of Transfer. One just has to be careful with quantifiers -- on which set to take them.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nLet us note that\n\\begin{Prop}\nFor any (standard) set $A$, and any (standard) $a\\in A$, the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$A-elements $\\nu(\\nu(a))$ and $({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu(a))$ are the same.\n\\end{Prop}\n\\begin{Prf}\nFor any map $f:A\\to B$, ${^\\star} f:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star} B$ does to the $\\nu$ of elements of $A$ the same as $f$ does to the elements. This means ${^\\star} f(\\nu(a))=\\nu(f(a)),\\,a\\in A$. Now take $B={^\\star} A$ and $f:A\\to B$ to be $\\nu:A\\to{^\\star} A$.\n\\end{Prf}\nAnd one easily sees that $a\\mapsto\\nu(\\nu(a))$ and $a\\mapsto({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu(a))$ ``transfer'' relations and functions in the same way.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo clarify the relationship between these $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$ let us consider, as an example, the case $A={\\mathbb{{R}}}$, with its subset ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\subsection{{Non-Standard Analysis}\\ and Iterated {Non-Standard Analysis}\\ in ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ and ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$}\nWe place ourself in a {non-standard analysis}\\ which is $\\aleph_0^+$-saturated, and look at the {non-standard analysis}\\ inside ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$, in particular inside its subset ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n$\\aleph_0^+$-saturation implies that for a descending sequence ${^\\star} a_n$, (and an ascending sequence ${^\\star} b_n$) of ${^\\star}$members of ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ (or any other linearly ordered set), such that ${^\\star} a_n>{^\\star} b_m\\,\\forall n,m$  there is a ${^\\star}$member ${^\\star} c$ of ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ such that ${^\\star} a_n>{^\\star} c$ (and ${^\\star} c>{^\\star} b_m$)\\,$\\forall n,m$. In particular, there are ${^\\star}$reals, also ${^\\star}$natural numbers, that are bigger than all finite standard numbers. These are sometimes called (positive) {\\em infinite} or {\\em unlimited}, while a ${^\\star}$real whose absolute value is not unlimited will be called {\\em limited}. While for any $n\\in{\\mathbb{{N}}}$ the set $]\\leftarrow,n]$ in ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ is finite, therefore all its ${^\\star}$membrs are standard, and consequently all ${^\\star}$natural numbers are either standard or unlimited, there are ${^\\star}$real numbers $>0$ but smaller than any standard positive real. As is well-known, these are called (positive) {\\em infinitesimal} ${^\\star}$reals (and a positive or negative ${^\\star}$real is called infinitesimal if its absolute value is infinitesimal). As is well-known, and easily proved using the completeness of ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ (say, the existence of suprema and infima), for any {\\em limited} ${^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ there is a unique standard $\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a)\\in{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ so that ${^\\star} a-\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a)$ is infinitesimal. Two ${^\\star}$reals whose difference is infinitesimal are called {\\em near}.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow, as said above, ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ also has its ${^\\star}$members, forming the set ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ which may be referred to as the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals. And there is a $\\nu:{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\to{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ which maps each ${^\\star}$real to the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$real to be identified with it, and since there is $\\nu:{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\to{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, it gives rise to ${^\\star}\\nu:{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\to{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$. As said above, these are two\n``embeddings'' of ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ into ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nLet's take a look at the set of positive (thus nonzero) infinitesimal ${^\\star}$reals. Note that, by the above, for any ascending (resp.\\ descending) sequence of them there is a positive infinitesimal further bigger (resp. smaller) than all of them. The set of infinitesimals is external -- if it were internal it would have a ${^\\star}$supremum which is impossible. It has ${^\\star}$members, the ${^\\star}$infinitesimals -- thay are ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals. In particular, since for any set $A$\\,\\,$\\nu$ maps $A$ into ${^\\star} A$, $\\nu$ of infinitesimals are ${^\\star}$infinitesimals.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow, since the positive infinitesimals are the positive ${^\\star}$reals that are smaller than $\\nu(r)$ for all reals $r>0$, we have by Transfer: the positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimals are the positive ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals smaller than ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} r)$ for all ${^\\star}$reals ${^\\star} r>0$. But note that we can take here as ${^\\star} r$ a positive infinitesimal! Thus we have:{\\par\\medskip}\n\nAll positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimals, which include the $\\nu$ of positive infinitesimals, are smaller than all ${^\\star}\\nu$ of positive infinitesimals!{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTurning to the other end, there are the positive ${^\\star}$unlimited ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals, which include the $\\nu$ of unlimited ${^\\star}$reals. They are characterized as bigger than ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} r)$ for all ${^\\star} r\\in{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$. Thus they are bigger than the ${^\\star}\\nu$ of unlimited ${^\\star}$reals.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nConsider, in particular, ${^\\star}{^\\star}$natural numbers. We saw that the ${^\\star}$naural numbers are partitioned into two sets: $\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}})$ and the unlimited ${^\\star}$natural numbers, the latter all bigger than the former. This gives by Transfer: the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$natural numbers are partitioned into ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}})$ and the ${^\\star}$unlimited ${^\\star}{^\\star}$natural numbers, the latter all bigger than the former. The latter include the $\\nu$ of unlimited ${^\\star}$natural numbers. The former are, of course, partitioned into $\\nu(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))=({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))$, and the ${^\\star}\\nu$ of the unlimited, the latter all bigger than the former. To repeat: ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}}$ is partitioned into three parts: $\\nu(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))=({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))$, all smaller than ${^\\star}\\nu$ of the unlimited, these all smaller than the ${^\\star}$unlimited, which include the $\\nu$ of the unlimited.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIf we assume the {non-standard analysis}\\ is $\\aleph_0$-confined (or more generally, is ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined and ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}^+$-saturated for some infinite cardinal ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$), we will have: every positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimal ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\varepsilon}$\\,${^\\star}$belongs to a countable set of infinitesimals, the latter, by $\\aleph_0^+$-saturation, as said above, has a positive infinitesimal upper (resp.\\ lower) bound. Hence (the $\\nu$ value) of the bound is bigger (resp.\\ smaller) also than ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\varepsilon}$. Thus ``being less than (the $\\nu$-value of) a positive infinitesimal'' is the same as ``being less than a positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimal''. Similarly, in ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ or in ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}}$, every ${^\\star}$unlimited ${^\\star}{^\\star}$number has an upper (resp.\\ lower) bound which is $\\nu$ of an unlimited ${^\\star}$number.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe had the (equivalence) relation in ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ of ``being near'', i.e.\\ having an infinitesimal difference. In fact, it is an intersection $\\cap_n{^\\star} U_n$ of the ${^\\star}$'s of a decreasing sequence of standard relations $U_n\\subset{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\times{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, in this case a basis to the uniformity in ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$. We had: the equivalence class of a limited ${^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ contains a unique standard $\\nu(\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a))$,\\,\\,$\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a)$ called the {\\em standard part} of ${^\\star} a$. Moving from such a relation to a relation in ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, we have two options:{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThe ``strong'' (equivalence) relation ${^\\star}(\\cap_n{^\\star} U_n))$ -- the difference being a ${^\\star}$infinitesimal. The existence of the standard part implies by Transfer: the equivalence class of a ${^\\star}$limited ${^\\star}{^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ contains a unique element ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star}\\textrm{st}({^\\star}{^\\star} a))\\in{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}})$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThe ``weak'' (equivalence) relation $\\cap_n{^\\star}{^\\star} U_n)$, in our case saying that the difference being less than any $\\nu(\\nu(a))$,\\,\\,$a>0,a\\in{\\mathbb{{R}}}$. Lets call such ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals {\\em ``weakly infinitesimal''}. These are the elements equivalent to $0$, and they include all ${^\\star}\\nu$ of infinitesimals. In fact, any ${^\\star}{^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ with standard bounds is thus ``weakly'' equivalent to $\\nu(\\nu\\big(\\textrm{st}({^\\star}\\textrm{st}({^\\star}{^\\star} a))\\big))$, which is the only standard element in its equivalence class.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n(Note that we could start with only the rational numbers ${\\mathbb{{Q}}}$, consider ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{Q}}}$, define infinitesimals and being near as above, and then recover ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ as the set of equivalence classes of {\\em limited} ${^\\star}$rationals with respect to nearness. Transferring, ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ will be identified with the set of equivalence classes of ${^\\star}$limited ${^\\star}{^\\star}$rationals with respect to ${^\\star}$nearness, i.e.\\ having a ${^\\star}$infinitesimal difference.)\n\n\\subsection{A Criterion for $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$ of ${^\\star}$Elements to Satisfy Some Standard Relation, and Applications}\n\nReturn to general (standard) sets.\n\\begin{Prop}\\label{Prop:nunustar}\nLet $A$ and $B$ be (standard) sets and let $R\\subset A\\times B$ be a (standard) relation between elements of $A$ and elements of $B$.

In a well-known construction, one takes the space of elements of ${^\\star} X$ with {\\em limited} norm and quotient it by the subspace of infinitesimal vectors (i.e.\\ those with infinitesimal norm), (and denote equivalence classes modulo the infinitesimals by $[\\,\\,]$), to get an ordinary Banach (resp.\\ Hilbert) space, called the {\\em {non-standard}\\ hull} of $X$.

For example, if $X=\\ell^p$ then ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ consists of equivalence classes of ``sequences'' defined on ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}}$, and a sequence may have infinitesimal entries but finite nonzero norm, or can be supported on unlimited ${^\\star}$numbers, and then it is not in the image of $X$.){\\par\\medskip}\n\nAs for ${^\\star}{^\\star} X$, we have here, similarly to what we saw in ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$, the\n${^\\star}$infinitesimal vectors -- vectors with ${^\\star}$infinitesimal norm, which are part of the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$vactors with ``weakly infinitesimal'' norm. Call the latter ``weakly infinitesimal'' ${^\\star}{^\\star}$vactors. Factoring the space of ${^\\star}{^\\star}$vactors whose norm is bounded by a ($\\nu\\circ\\nu$ of a) standard number by the ``weakly infinitesimal'' ones one again gets an ordinary Banach space (resp.\\ Hilbert space) ${\\mathcal{H}}^{(2)}(X)$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow, $\\nu,{^\\star}\\nu:{^\\star} X\\to{^\\star}{^\\star} X$ will define two embeddings of ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ into ${\\mathcal{H}}^{(2)}(X)$, which by abuse of language we also refer to as $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo see an example of what Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:nunustar} would say here, take $X$ to be a Hilbert space. Suppose $[{^\\star} a]\\in{\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ and $[{^\\star} b]$ belong to the orthogonal complement of $X$ in ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$. Then for any (standard) ${\\varepsilon}>0$ the set of standard vectors $b$ with $|<b,{^\\star} a>|<{\\varepsilon}$ is everything. So by Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:nunustar} $|<{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} b),\\nu({^\\star} a)>|<{\\varepsilon}$. Consequently:{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIf $[{^\\star} a]\\in{\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ and $[{^\\star} b]$ belong to the orthogonal complement of $X$ in ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ then $[{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} b)]$ is always orthogonal to $[\\nu({^\\star} a)]$. (In particular, $[{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} b)]$ is orthogonal to $[\\nu({^\\star} b)]$.)\n\\end{itemize}\n\\bigskip\n\nAnother application of Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:nunustar},\n\\begin{Prop}\nAssume the {non-standard analysis}\\ is $\\aleph_0^+$-saturated.\n\nLet $A$ be linearly ordered.

For every set $A$, we have ${^\\star} A$, but, of course, ${^\\star} A$ being again a set, we have ${^\\star}{^\\star} A$, also ${^\\star}{^\\star}{^\\star} A$ etc. The {non-standard analysis}\\ defines, for every set $A$, an injection $\\nu:A\\to{^\\star} A$ mapping $a\\in A\\mapsto\\nu(a)\\in{^\\star} A$. Therefore we have (again an injection, by Transfer) ${^\\star}\\nu:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star}{^\\star} A$. Note that we still have $\\nu:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star}{^\\star} A$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nBoth $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$ are injective. Thus both ``embed'' ${^\\star} A$ in ${^\\star}{^\\star} A$. Yet they are highly different, as we shall see.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n$\\nu$, of course, satisfies Transfer. But by Transferring Transfer we find that also ${^\\star}\\nu$ satisfies a kind of Transfer. One just has to be careful with quantifiers -- on which set to take them.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nLet us note that\n\\begin{Prop}\nFor any (standard) set $A$, and any (standard) $a\\in A$, the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$A-elements $\\nu(\\nu(a))$ and $({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu(a))$ are the same.\n\\end{Prop}\n\\begin{Prf}\nFor any map $f:A\\to B$, ${^\\star} f:{^\\star} A\\to{^\\star} B$ does to the $\\nu$ of elements of $A$ the same as $f$ does to the elements. This means ${^\\star} f(\\nu(a))=\\nu(f(a)),\\,a\\in A$. Now take $B={^\\star} A$ and $f:A\\to B$ to be $\\nu:A\\to{^\\star} A$.\n\\end{Prf}\nAnd one easily sees that $a\\mapsto\\nu(\\nu(a))$ and $a\\mapsto({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu(a))$ ``transfer'' relations and functions in the same way.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo clarify the relationship between these $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$ let us consider, as an example, the case $A={\\mathbb{{R}}}$, with its subset ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\subsection{{Non-Standard Analysis}\\ and Iterated {Non-Standard Analysis}\\ in ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ and ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$}\nWe place ourself in a {non-standard analysis}\\ which is $\\aleph_0^+$-saturated, and look at the {non-standard analysis}\\ inside ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$, in particular inside its subset ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n$\\aleph_0^+$-saturation implies that for a descending sequence ${^\\star} a_n$, (and an ascending sequence ${^\\star} b_n$) of ${^\\star}$members of ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ (or any other linearly ordered set), such that ${^\\star} a_n>{^\\star} b_m\\,\\forall n,m$  there is a ${^\\star}$member ${^\\star} c$ of ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ such that ${^\\star} a_n>{^\\star} c$ (and ${^\\star} c>{^\\star} b_m$)\\,$\\forall n,m$. In particular, there are ${^\\star}$reals, also ${^\\star}$natural numbers, that are bigger than all finite standard numbers. These are sometimes called (positive) {\\em infinite} or {\\em unlimited}, while a ${^\\star}$real whose absolute value is not unlimited will be called {\\em limited}. While for any $n\\in{\\mathbb{{N}}}$ the set $]\\leftarrow,n]$ in ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ is finite, therefore all its ${^\\star}$membrs are standard, and consequently all ${^\\star}$natural numbers are either standard or unlimited, there are ${^\\star}$real numbers $>0$ but smaller than any standard positive real. As is well-known, these are called (positive) {\\em infinitesimal} ${^\\star}$reals (and a positive or negative ${^\\star}$real is called infinitesimal if its absolute value is infinitesimal). As is well-known, and easily proved using the completeness of ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ (say, the existence of suprema and infima), for any {\\em limited} ${^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ there is a unique standard $\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a)\\in{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ so that ${^\\star} a-\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a)$ is infinitesimal. Two ${^\\star}$reals whose difference is infinitesimal are called {\\em near}.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow, as said above, ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ also has its ${^\\star}$members, forming the set ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ which may be referred to as the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals. And there is a $\\nu:{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\to{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ which maps each ${^\\star}$real to the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$real to be identified with it, and since there is $\\nu:{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\to{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, it gives rise to ${^\\star}\\nu:{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\to{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$. As said above, these are two\n``embeddings'' of ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ into ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nLet's take a look at the set of positive (thus nonzero) infinitesimal ${^\\star}$reals. Note that, by the above, for any ascending (resp.\\ descending) sequence of them there is a positive infinitesimal further bigger (resp. smaller) than all of them. The set of infinitesimals is external -- if it were internal it would have a ${^\\star}$supremum which is impossible. It has ${^\\star}$members, the ${^\\star}$infinitesimals -- thay are ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals. In particular, since for any set $A$\\,\\,$\\nu$ maps $A$ into ${^\\star} A$, $\\nu$ of infinitesimals are ${^\\star}$infinitesimals.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow, since the positive infinitesimals are the positive ${^\\star}$reals that are smaller than $\\nu(r)$ for all reals $r>0$, we have by Transfer: the positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimals are the positive ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals smaller than ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} r)$ for all ${^\\star}$reals ${^\\star} r>0$. But note that we can take here as ${^\\star} r$ a positive infinitesimal! Thus we have:{\\par\\medskip}\n\nAll positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimals, which include the $\\nu$ of positive infinitesimals, are smaller than all ${^\\star}\\nu$ of positive infinitesimals!{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTurning to the other end, there are the positive ${^\\star}$unlimited ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals, which include the $\\nu$ of unlimited ${^\\star}$reals. They are characterized as bigger than ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} r)$ for all ${^\\star} r\\in{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$. Thus they are bigger than the ${^\\star}\\nu$ of unlimited ${^\\star}$reals.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nConsider, in particular, ${^\\star}{^\\star}$natural numbers. We saw that the ${^\\star}$naural numbers are partitioned into two sets: $\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}})$ and the unlimited ${^\\star}$natural numbers, the latter all bigger than the former. This gives by Transfer: the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$natural numbers are partitioned into ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}})$ and the ${^\\star}$unlimited ${^\\star}{^\\star}$natural numbers, the latter all bigger than the former. The latter include the $\\nu$ of unlimited ${^\\star}$natural numbers. The former are, of course, partitioned into $\\nu(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))=({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))$, and the ${^\\star}\\nu$ of the unlimited, the latter all bigger than the former. To repeat: ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}}$ is partitioned into three parts: $\\nu(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))=({^\\star}\\nu)(\\nu({\\mathbb{{N}}}))$, all smaller than ${^\\star}\\nu$ of the unlimited, these all smaller than the ${^\\star}$unlimited, which include the $\\nu$ of the unlimited.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIf we assume the {non-standard analysis}\\ is $\\aleph_0$-confined (or more generally, is ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$-confined and ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}^+$-saturated for some infinite cardinal ${\\mathfrak{{m}}}$), we will have: every positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimal ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\varepsilon}$\\,${^\\star}$belongs to a countable set of infinitesimals, the latter, by $\\aleph_0^+$-saturation, as said above, has a positive infinitesimal upper (resp.\\ lower) bound. Hence (the $\\nu$ value) of the bound is bigger (resp.\\ smaller) also than ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\varepsilon}$. Thus ``being less than (the $\\nu$-value of) a positive infinitesimal'' is the same as ``being less than a positive ${^\\star}$infinitesimal''. Similarly, in ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ or in ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}}$, every ${^\\star}$unlimited ${^\\star}{^\\star}$number has an upper (resp.\\ lower) bound which is $\\nu$ of an unlimited ${^\\star}$number.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nWe had the (equivalence) relation in ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ of ``being near'', i.e.\\ having an infinitesimal difference. In fact, it is an intersection $\\cap_n{^\\star} U_n$ of the ${^\\star}$'s of a decreasing sequence of standard relations $U_n\\subset{\\mathbb{{R}}}\\times{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, in this case a basis to the uniformity in ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$. We had: the equivalence class of a limited ${^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ contains a unique standard $\\nu(\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a))$,\\,\\,$\\textrm{st}({^\\star} a)$ called the {\\em standard part} of ${^\\star} a$. Moving from such a relation to a relation in ${^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$, we have two options:{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThe ``strong'' (equivalence) relation ${^\\star}(\\cap_n{^\\star} U_n))$ -- the difference being a ${^\\star}$infinitesimal. The existence of the standard part implies by Transfer: the equivalence class of a ${^\\star}$limited ${^\\star}{^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ contains a unique element ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star}\\textrm{st}({^\\star}{^\\star} a))\\in{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}})$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nThe ``weak'' (equivalence) relation $\\cap_n{^\\star}{^\\star} U_n)$, in our case saying that the difference being less than any $\\nu(\\nu(a))$,\\,\\,$a>0,a\\in{\\mathbb{{R}}}$. Lets call such ${^\\star}{^\\star}$reals {\\em ``weakly infinitesimal''}. These are the elements equivalent to $0$, and they include all ${^\\star}\\nu$ of infinitesimals. In fact, any ${^\\star}{^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}{^\\star}{\\mathbb{{R}}}$ with standard bounds is thus ``weakly'' equivalent to $\\nu(\\nu\\big(\\textrm{st}({^\\star}\\textrm{st}({^\\star}{^\\star} a))\\big))$, which is the only standard element in its equivalence class.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n(Note that we could start with only the rational numbers ${\\mathbb{{Q}}}$, consider ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{Q}}}$, define infinitesimals and being near as above, and then recover ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ as the set of equivalence classes of {\\em limited} ${^\\star}$rationals with respect to nearness.

Indeed, every point of $X$ is a limit of an ultrafilter in the dense subset, and an ultrafilter has a unique limit, hence there must be at least $2^{2^{|B|}}$ such ultrafilters.\n\nWe proceed to find such an $X$.\n\nDenote by $\\mathbf2=\\{0,1\\}$ the field, thus additive group, with two elements, endowed with the discrete topology.\n\nConsider the group $\\mathbf2^B$. By viewing the members of $\\mathbf2^B$ as characteristic functions of subsets of $B$, we can identify $\\mathbf2^B={\\mathcal{P}} B$. $\\mathbf2^B$ is a linear vector space over the field $\\mathbf2$. As such, it has a (Hamel) basis $W$, and since the vector space is the set of sums of finite subsets of $W$, we have $|W|=|\\mathbf2^B|=2^{|B|}$.\n\nLet $H$ be the group of all homomorphisms $h:\\mathbf2^B\\to\\mathbf2$. Since such a homomorphism is uniquely determined by giving its values on the members of $W$, which may be given arbitrarily, we may identify $H=\\mathbf2^W$. The product topology here, which is also the weakest topology such that all evaluation maps at elements of $\\mathbf2^B$ are continuous (hence does not depend on the choice of basis $W$), makes $H$ a compact (Hausdorff) topological group of cardinality $2^{2^{|B|}}$.\n\n$B$ can be viewed as a subset of $H$, identifying every $b\\in B$ with the homomorphism\n$h:\\mathbf2^B\\to\\mathbf2$ of evaluation at $b$. Let $<B>$ be the subgroup (also $\\mathbf2$-linear subspace) of $H$ generated by this $B$. Since $<B>$ is just the set of\nsums of finite subsets of $B$, we have $|<B>|=|B|$.\n\nThus, we shall be finished if we prove $<B>$ is dense in $H$.\n\nLet ${\\overline{{<B>}}}$ be the closure of $<B>$ in $H$, and suppose ${\\overline{{<B>}}}\\ne H$. Then there is a point $h_0\\in H\\setminus{\\overline{{<B>}}}$ and a neighborhood of $h_0$ disjoint from ${\\overline{{<B>}}}$. Thus there are $w_1,\\ldots w_n\\in W$ so that no element of ${\\overline{{<B>}}}$, in particular no element $\\sum_\\iota b_\\iota\\in<B>$, $(b_\\iota)_\\iota$ a finite subset of $B$, satisfies\n$\\sum_\\iota w_1(b_\\iota)=h_0(w_1),\\ldots,\\sum_\\iota w_n(b_\\iota)=h_0(w_n)$. This means that the set of all $\\sum_\\iota(w_1(b_\\iota),\\ldots,w_n(b_\\iota))\\in\\mathbf2^n$ for all finite subsets $(b_\\iota)_\\iota$, is not the whole of $\\mathbf2^n$. Since this set is a linear subspace of the $n$-dimensional vector space $\\mathbf2^n$ over $\\mathbf2$, and it is not the whole space, there is a non-zero linear functional which vanishes on it. Thus, there are ${\\varepsilon}_1,\\ldots,{\\varepsilon}_n\\in\\mathbf2$, not all of them $0$, so that $\\sum{\\varepsilon}_jw_j(b)=0$ for all $b\\in B$, that is $\\sum{\\varepsilon}_jw_j=0$, contradicting the linear independence of the basis $W$.\n\\end{Prf}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{MM10}\n\n\\bibitem[ChK]{ChangKeisler}\nC.~C.~Chang, H.~J.~Keisler, {\\em Model Theory} (3rd edition), North-Holland,\nAmsterdam 1992.\n\n\\bibitem[Cu88]{Cutland88}\nN.~J.~Cutland (ed.), {\\em Nonstandard Analysis and its Applications}.\nCambridge Univ.\\ Press, 1988.\n\n\\bibitem[Cu01]{Cutland01}\nN.~J.~Cutland, {\\em Loeb Measures in Practice: Recent Advances}.

Thus if ${^\\star} a$ is ``infinite'' in the sense of majorizing all standard elements, then the latter cone is everything so we always have ${^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} b)\\le\\nu({^\\star} a)$ (similarly to what we saw in ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$ and ${\\mathbb{{N}}}$ in the previous subsection).{\\par\\medskip}\n\n\\item Let $A$ be a (standard) set and $B$ a set of subsets of $A$, with the relation $a\\in b$.

Then on ${^\\star} X$ there is a ${^\\star} {\\mathbb{{R}}}$-valued norm (resp.\\ inner product and norm). In a well-known construction, one takes the space of elements of ${^\\star} X$ with {\\em limited} norm and quotient it by the subspace of infinitesimal vectors (i.e.\\ those with infinitesimal norm), (and denote equivalence classes modulo the infinitesimals by $[\\,\\,]$), to get an ordinary Banach (resp.\\ Hilbert) space, called the {\\em {non-standard}\\ hull} of $X$. Denote it by ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$. It is complete, provided we have $\\aleph_0^+$-saturation.\n\\footnote{Indeed, Suppose $[{^\\star} x_n]$ is a Cauchy sequence in ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$.

The $B_m$ are internal sets and any finite number of them intersect (since they all contains all ${^\\star} x_n$ from some $n$ onward). By $\\aleph_0^+$-Saturation they all intersect, and if ${^\\star} x_0$ is a member of the intersection, then clearly $[{^\\star} x_n]\\to[{^\\star} x_0]$.}\nThe $\\nu:H\\to{^\\star} H$, followed by the factoring by the infinitesimals, defines a (norm-preserving) embedding of $X$ into ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\n(In general, this embedding is not onto -- ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ has much more elements that $X$. For example, if $X=\\ell^p$ then ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ consists of equivalence classes of ``sequences'' defined on ${^\\star}{\\mathbb{{N}}}$, and a sequence may have infinitesimal entries but finite nonzero norm, or can be supported on unlimited ${^\\star}$numbers, and then it is not in the image of $X$.){\\par\\medskip}\n\nAs for ${^\\star}{^\\star} X$, we have here, similarly to what we saw in ${\\mathbb{{R}}}$, the\n${^\\star}$infinitesimal vectors -- vectors with ${^\\star}$infinitesimal norm, which are part of the ${^\\star}{^\\star}$vactors with ``weakly infinitesimal'' norm. Call the latter ``weakly infinitesimal'' ${^\\star}{^\\star}$vactors. Factoring the space of ${^\\star}{^\\star}$vactors whose norm is bounded by a ($\\nu\\circ\\nu$ of a) standard number by the ``weakly infinitesimal'' ones one again gets an ordinary Banach space (resp.\\ Hilbert space) ${\\mathcal{H}}^{(2)}(X)$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nNow, $\\nu,{^\\star}\\nu:{^\\star} X\\to{^\\star}{^\\star} X$ will define two embeddings of ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ into ${\\mathcal{H}}^{(2)}(X)$, which by abuse of language we also refer to as $\\nu$ and ${^\\star}\\nu$.{\\par\\medskip}\n\nTo see an example of what Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:nunustar} would say here, take $X$ to be a Hilbert space. Suppose $[{^\\star} a]\\in{\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ and $[{^\\star} b]$ belong to the orthogonal complement of $X$ in ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$. Then for any (standard) ${\\varepsilon}>0$ the set of standard vectors $b$ with $|<b,{^\\star} a>|<{\\varepsilon}$ is everything. So by Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:nunustar} $|<{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} b),\\nu({^\\star} a)>|<{\\varepsilon}$. Consequently:{\\par\\medskip}\n\nIf $[{^\\star} a]\\in{\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ and $[{^\\star} b]$ belong to the orthogonal complement of $X$ in ${\\mathcal{H}}(X)$ then $[{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} b)]$ is always orthogonal to $[\\nu({^\\star} a)]$. (In particular, $[{^\\star}\\nu({^\\star} b)]$ is orthogonal to $[\\nu({^\\star} b)]$.)\n\\end{itemize}\n\\bigskip\n\nAnother application of Prop.\\ \\ref{Prop:nunustar},\n\\begin{Prop}\nAssume the {non-standard analysis}\\ is $\\aleph_0^+$-saturated.\n\nLet $A$ be linearly ordered.

By $\\aleph_0^+$-saturation, there is a ${^\\star} a\\in{^\\star}\\{a_n\\}$ smaller than all the $a_n$. The set of (standard) members of\n$\\{a_n\\}$ that are $>{^\\star} a$ is the whole $\\{a_n\\}$, to which ${^\\star} a$ certainly ${^\\star}$belongs.
