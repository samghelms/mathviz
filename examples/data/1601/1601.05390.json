The pressure gradient would generate anisotropic expansion and final-state elliptic flow~\\cite{Ollitrault:1992bk}. Large elliptic anisotropy in momentum ($v_2$) has been measured, as large as hydrodynamic calculations predict~\\cite{Arsene:2004fa,Heinz:2013th}. \nThis suggests that the collision system is strongly interacting and nearly thermalized, dubbed sQGP~\\cite{Gyulassy:2004zy}. \n\nA hallmark of the hydrodynamic description of relativistic heavy ion collisions is the mass splitting of $v_2$ at a given, low transverse momentum (${p_{\\perp}}$)~\\cite{Heinz:2013th}. It is consistent with a common radial velocity field, whose azimuthal modulation gives rise to momentum-space azimuthal anisotropy, and whose effect on hadron ${p_{\\perp}}$ via the Cooper-Frye hadronization mechanism~\\cite{Cooper:1974mv} (commonly exploited in hydrodynamic calculations) gives rise to the mass splitting.\n\nIt is generally perceived that large $v_2$ can only be generated in large-system heavy ion collisions, and hydrodynamics is a highly plausible scenario for how the collision system evolves. Recent particle correlation data, however, hint at similar $v_2$ and mass splitting effects in small systems of high multiplicity \n$p$+$p$ and $p$+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider~\\cite{Khachatryan:2010gv} \nand {$d$+Au}\\ collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)~\\cite{Adare:2014keg}. \nHydrodynamics has been applied to these systems and seems to successfully describe the experimental data, including the mass splitting~\\cite{Bozek:2010pb}. \nThis could suggest that these small-system collisions create a sQGP as well, in contrast to general expectation. \n\nOn the other hand, parton transport models, such as A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT)~\\cite{Zhang:1999bd,Lin:2004en}, have also been widely used to describe experimental data. The string melting version of AMPT~\\cite{Lin:2001zk,Lin:2004en} reasonably reproduces particle yields, ${p_{\\perp}}$ spectra, and $v_2$ of low-${p_{\\perp}}$ pions and kaons in central and mid-central Au+Au collisions at 200A GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2760A GeV~\\cite{Lin:2014tya}. The small system data can be also satisfactorily described by AMPT~\\cite{Bzdak:2014dia}. The successful description by AMPT of experimental data, especially the heavy ion data, did not come as a surprise, because it has been thought that the transport models have approached hydrodynamic limit due to high energy densities and/or large parton-parton interaction cross sections. \n\nHowever, a recent study using AMPT shows that the azimuthal anisotropy is mainly generated by the so-called ``escape'' mechanism~\\cite{He:2015hfa}; \nhydrodynamics may play only a minor role. The escape mechanism would naturally and simultaneously explain the measured azimuthal anisotropies in both heavy ion and small system collisions. While the escape mechanism does not generate radial flow, $v_2$ mass splitting is also present in AMPT. This suggests that hydrodynamic radial flow may not be the only mechanism that can generate the mass splitting of $v_2$. The underlying reason for the mass splitting in AMPT is the question we address in this Letter. \n\n{\\em Model and Analysis.}\n\nWe employ the string melting version of AMPT~\\cite{Lin:2001zk,Lin:2004en} in our study. The model consists of fluctuating initial conditions, $2\\to2$ parton elastic scatterings~\\cite{Zhang:1997ej}, quark coalescence for hadronization, and hadronic interactions. \nWe use Debye screened differential cross-section $d\\sigma/dt\\propto\\alpha_s^2/(t-\\mu_D^2)^2$~\\cite{Lin:2004en}, with strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s=0.33$ and Debye screening mass $\\mu_D=2.265$/fm (the total cross section is then $\\sigma=3$~mb). \n\nWe simulate Au+Au collisions (impact parameter $b=6.6$-8.1~fm corresponding to 20-30\\% centrality~\\cite{Abelev:2008ab}) and {$d$+Au}\\ collisions at $b=0$~fm at 200A GeV by AMPT. The AMPT version and parameter values are the same as those used for RHIC collisions in earlier studies~\\cite{Lin:2014tya,He:2015hfa}.

The gluon degrees of freedom can be considered as being absorbed in the quark's. Figure~\\ref{fig:uds} shows the elliptic anisotropies of the $u$ and $d$ light (anti)quarks and the $s$ strange (anti)quarks by the solid curves. There is practically no difference between quark and antiquark $v_2$'s so they are combined; Likewise, the $u$ and $d$ quark $v_2$'s are combined. At low ${p_{\\perp}}$ the light quark $v_2$ is larger than the $s$ quark $v_2$. \nAlthough $v_2$ comes largely from the anisotropic escape mechanism, there does exist a contribution from hydrodynamics in AMPT~\\cite{He:2015hfa}. We thus also carry out the test calculation with no collective anisotropic flow by randomizing the outgoing parton azimuthal directions after each parton-parton scattering as in Ref.~\\cite{He:2015hfa}. When the parton azimuthal angles are randomized, the final-state parton anisotropy is entirely due to the anisotropic escape mechanism~\\cite{He:2015hfa}. However, difference between light and $s$ quark $v_2$'s is still observed as shown by the dashed curves. \nThe fact that this difference is similar between the normal and {$\\phi$-randomized}\\ AMPT~\\cite{prc} suggests that it may be caused by kinematic difference in the scattering processes due to their mass difference rather than collective flow. At high ${p_{\\perp}}$ their $v_2$'s approach to each other as expected because the mass difference becomes unimportant (and quark scattering cross-sections are all set to be the same).\n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{Fig1_PRL_v5.pdf}\n    \\caption{{\\em Parton $v_2$.} Mid-rapidity ($|\\eta|<1$) parton $v_2$ as a function of ${p_{\\perp}}$ for $u$+$d$ (thick curves) and $s$ (anti)quarks (thin curves) in the final state before hadronization in $b=6.6$-8.1~fm Au+Au collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}}=200$~GeV by normal AMPT (solid) and {$\\phi$-randomized}\\ AMPT (dashed). }\n    \\label{fig:uds}\n  \\end{center}\n\n\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{Fig2_PRL_v5.pdf}\n    \\caption{{\\em Mass splitting from coalescence.} Mid-rapidity ($|\\eta|<1$) constituent quark (c.q., dashed curves) and primordial hadron (solid curves) $v_2$ as a function of {\\em hadron} ${p_{\\perp}}$ right after hadronization before hadronic rescatterings in $b=6.6$-8.1~fm Au+Au collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}}=200$~GeV by normal AMPT (upper) and {$\\phi$-randomized}\\ AMPT (lower).}\n    \\label{fig:coal}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n{\\em Mass splitting from coalescence.}\nSince primordial (i.e.~directly formed by quark coalescence) pions and protons all come from light quarks, the difference between their $v_2$'s must come from the hadronization process and/or hadronic rescatterings. We study the effect of the former by examining $v_2$ of hadrons right after hadronization, before any hadronic rescatterings take place. Figure~\\ref{fig:coal} shows the $v_2$ of primordial charged pion, kaon, and (anti)proton as a function of ${p_{\\perp}}$ (solid curves). The difference observed between pion and proton $v_2$ can only come from the hadronization process. \nThe string melting AMPT model forms hadrons via quark coalescence~\\cite{Lin:2009tk}. \nThe pion and proton $v_2$ difference arises from the different numbers of constituent quarks they are made of and the kinematics of those coalescing (anti)quarks. At high ${p_{\\perp}}$ the hadron $v_2$ has been measured to exhibit a scaling in the number of constituent quarks after the hadron ${p_{\\perp}}$ is divided by the number of constituent quarks, $v_2^{\\rm baryon}({p_{\\perp}}/3)/3 \\approx v_2^{\\rm meson}({p_{\\perp}}/2)/2$. \nThis has a natural explanation in quark coalescence, where two or three relatively high ${p_{\\perp}}$ quarks are more or less collimated and coalesce into a meson or baryon. Mesons and baryons, respectively, take on twice and three times the quark $v_2$ (which are saturated at high ${p_{\\perp}}$ as seen in Fig.~\\ref{fig:uds}). Apparently, this quark coalescence picture cannot be extended to low ${p_{\\perp}}$~\\cite{Lin:2009tk}; if it could, then, because the quark $v_2$ is approximately linear at low ${p_{\\perp}}$ (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:uds}), the meson and baryon $v_2({p_{\\perp}})$ as a function of ${p_{\\perp}}$ would coincide with each other (the two or three constituent quark ${p_{\\perp}}$'s add to the hadron ${p_{\\perp}}$ and the quark $v_2$'s also add to the hadron $v_2$) and there would be no mass splitting. The mass splitting of $v_2$ at low ${p_{\\perp}}$ in AMPT comes from the dynamics in the coalescence process~\\cite{Lin:2009tk}, such as the finite opening angles or kinematics~\\cite{prc}.\nThe dynamical ``selections'' of constituent quarks into pions, kaons, and protons are manifest in the constituent quark $v_2$ distributions shown by the dashed curves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:coal}, plotted at the respective {\\em hadron} ${p_{\\perp}}$. The constituent quarks for a given hadron ${p_{\\perp}}$ value are spread in their parton ${p_{\\perp}}$'s and their $v_2$'s do not arithmetically add up to the hadron $v_2$ because of finite opening angles~\\cite{prc}.\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:coal} lower panel shows the $v_2$ results by {$\\phi$-randomized}\\ AMPT~\\cite{He:2015hfa} for primordial hadrons right after coalescence hadronization and the corresponding constituent quark $v_2$'s. No hydrodynamic anisotropic flow is present in the {$\\phi$-randomized}\\ case~\\cite{He:2015hfa}, however, mass splitting is still observed. This reinforces our conclusion that the mass splitting is mainly due to kinematics in the coalescence process; it is therefore not a unique signature of collective anisotropic flow or hydrodynamics.\n\n\n{\\em Effects of hadronic rescatterings.}\nShown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:coal} are $v_2$ of {\\em primordial} hadrons. After hadronization, particles interact both inelastically and elastically. Unstable particles decay. Measured in detectors are particles after interactions cease and after resonances decay. \nIn order to study effects of hadronic rescatterings on $v_2$, we ought to first evaluate the $v_2$ of hadrons before hadronic rescatterings but including effects of resonance decays. To this end, we run AMPT with the maximum time for hadronic scatterings set to 0.6~{fm/$c$}, and then analyze $v_2$ of the ``final-state'' hadrons. The final-state hadrons from such a setting do not have hadronic rescattering but include decay products. The results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rescatt} by the dashed curves.\nThe decay product $v_2$ is usually smaller than their parent $v_2$~\\cite{prc}. By including decay products, the hadron $v_2$'s (dashed curves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rescatt}) are reduced from those of primordial hadrons (solid curves in Fig.~\\ref{fig:coal}); so is the magnitude of mass-splitting in $v_2$.\n\nThe $v_2$ values before hadronic rescattering (including resonance decay effects) can be considered as the initial $v_2$ for the hadronic evolution stage. The final-stage freezeout hadron $v_2$'s (also including decay daughters) are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rescatt} by the solid curves. Pion $v_2$ increases while proton $v_2$ decreases from before to after hadronic rescatterings. This may be understood as follows. Because of interactions between pions and protons, they tend to flow together at the same velocity. Thus, the same-velocity pions and protons (i.e.~small ${p_{\\perp}}$ pions and large ${p_{\\perp}}$ protons) will tend to have the same anisotropy. This will yield lower $v_2$ for the protons and higher $v_2$ for the pions at the same ${p_{\\perp}}$ value. This should happen whether or not there is a net gain in the overall charged hadron $v_2$, which depends on the initial configuration geometry from which the hadronic evolution begins~\\cite{prc}.\nFigure~\\ref{fig:rescatt} also shows the results for {$d$+Au}\\ collisions. There, pion $v_2$ increases significantly due to hadronic scattering, while the proton $v_2$ remains roughly unchanged. This is a net effect of the splitting (i.e.~increase in pion $v_2$ and decrease in proton $v_2$) due to pion-proton interactions and an overall gain of $v_2$ for charged hadrons. The overall gain in the charged hadron $v_2$ is larger in {$d$+Au}\\ than Au+Au collisions, and this is due to a larger eccentricity in the {$d$+Au}\\ system at the start of hadron cascade~\\cite{prc}. \n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{Fig3_PRL_v5.pdf}\n    \\caption{{\\em Effects of hadronic rescatterings.} Mid-rapidity ($|\\eta|<1$) pion and (anti)proton $v_2$ before (dashed) and after (solid) hadronic rescatterings in $b=6.6$-8.1~fm Au+Au (upper) and $b=0$~fm {$d$+Au}\\ (lower) collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}}=200$~GeV by AMPT.}\n    \\label{fig:rescatt}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo summarize the origin of $v_2$ mass splitting, we plot in Fig.~\\ref{fig:summary} the $v_2$ of pions, kaons, and protons within $0.7<{p_{\\perp}}<0.8$~{GeV/$c$}, a typical region where the mass splitting is manifest, for different stages of the collision system evolution: (i) right after coalescence hadronization including only primordial hadrons (labeled ``prim.''); (ii) right after coalescence hadronization but including decay products (labeled ``w/ decay''); and (iii) at final freezeout (labeled ``w/ rescatt.~w/ decay). As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:summary}, most of the final-state hadron $v_2$ is built up in the partonic phase (more so in Au+Au than {$d$+Au}\\ collisions); additional gain in the overall $v_2$ magnitude from hadronic rescatterings is small. The $v_2$ mass splitting is modest between primordial hadrons (arising from kinematics in the coalescence procedure); this effect is reduced if including decay products. Despite of the little gain in the overall $v_2$, a significant mass splitting is built up during the hadronic rescattering stage. \n\\begin{figure}[hbt]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{Fig4_PRL_v5d.pdf}\n    \\caption{{\\em Origins of $v_2$ mass splitting.} Mid-rapidity ($|\\eta|<1$) $v_2$ of $\\pi$, K, p(${\\bar{p}}$) and charged hadrons ($h^\\pm$) at $0.7<{p_{\\perp}}<0.8$~{GeV/$c$}\\ at different stages of system evolution in $b=6.6$-8.1~fm Au+Au (upper) and $b=0$~fm {$d$+Au}\\ (lower) collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}}=200$~GeV by AMPT: right after coalescence hadronization and before hadronic rescatterings (initial $v_2$ of primordial hadrons), hadron initial $v_2$ including decays, and after hadronic rescatterings at freezeout (hadron final $v_2$).}\n    \\label{fig:summary}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n{\\em Summary.}\nPrevious studies have shown that the measured azimuthal anisotropies $v_n$ in heavy ion as well as small system collisions at low ${p_{\\perp}}$ can be well described by both hydrodynamics and parton transport model AMPT. The mass splitting of $v_n$ is considered as strong evidence for hydrodynamic collective flow. However, a recent study indicates that the major source of $v_n$ in AMPT is an anisotropic escape mechanism. In particular, it is the {\\em only} source of $v_n$ in the {$\\phi$-randomized}\\ test of AMPT.\n\n\n\nIn this Letter, we have studied the development of the $v_2$ mass splitting at different stages of nuclear collisions in AMPT. We find that, while the $v_2$ amplitude is dominantly developed during the parton cascade stage, the $v_2$ mass splitting is relatively small right after hadronization, especially when resonance decays are included. This mass splitting before hadronic rescatterings is produced by dynamics in the coalescence process such as kinematics. We demonstrate that the majority of the mass splitting is developed in the hadronic rescattering stage, although the gain in the overall charged particle $v_2$ magnitude is small. We found no qualitative difference between heavy ion collisions and small system collisions. We conclude that the mass splitting of $v_2$ cannot be considered as a unique signature of hydrodynamic collective flow.\n\n\n{\\em Acknowledgments.}\nThis work is supported in part by US~Department of Energy Grant No.~DE-FG02-88ER40412 (LH,FW,WX) and No.~DE-FG02-13ER16413 (DM).
