However, these studies have been performed largely under load-free conditions or with static load, while these cells function \\emph{in vivo} in a dynamic environment, receiving electrical energy to enhance mechanical oscillation in the inner ear.  This gap leaves uncertainties in addressing a key issue, how much mechanical energy an OHC provides. The present report is an attempt of bridging the gap by introducing a simple one-dimensional model for electromotility of OHC in a dynamic environment.  \nThis model incorporates a feedback loop involving the receptor potential and the mechanical load on OHC, and leads to an analytical expression for the membrane capacitance, which explicitly describes the dependence on the elastic load, viscous drag, and the mass. The derived equation of motion was examined in a mass-less model system with realistic parameter values for OHC. It was found that viscous drag is more effective than elastic load in enhancing the receptor potential that drives the cell. For this reason, it is expected that OHCs are more effective in counteracting viscous drag than providing elastic energy to the system.\n\\subsection*{key words:} amplifier, mammalian ear, membrane capacitance\n\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec:intro}\n A considerable progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of the mechanism of prestin-based somatic motility, or ``electromotility,'' of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea, both on cellular- \\cite{a1987,s1991,Dong2013} and the molecular levels~\\cite{zshlmd2000,oliv-fakl2001,Song2013}, as well as on its physical basis that it is based on electromechanical coupling \\cite{i1993,ts1995,i2001}. For example, experiments on isolated OHCs have determined load-free displacement~\\cite{a1987,s1991} and isometric force production \\cite{hal1995,ia1997}. These experimental observations can be described by static models \\cite{dhe1993,i2001}. Nonetheless, these are the conditions under which those cells do not provide energy. Some theoretical works have addressed energy production by OHCs  \\cite{Rabbitt2009,Ramamoorthy2012a} by extrapolating these \\emph{in vitro} conditions. However, these works do not provide an equation of motion, which is essential for understanding how OHCs work against the external load as the cochlear amplifier. \n\nThere are a number of issues to be addressed for describing OHCs in a dynamic environment. One such issue is the frequency dependence of the motile response. The amplitude of displacement in response to voltage changes rolls off at about 15 kHz under load-free condition, while force production near isometric condition remains flat up to 60 kHz~\\cite{fhg1999}. This difference likely indicates that the frequency response depends on the mechanical load, more specifically viscoelastic drag. \n\nAnother issue is attenuation of the receptor potential by the membrane capacitance at operating frequencies~\\cite{ha1992,Johnson2011,ospeck2012}. The membrane capacitance consists of two main components. One is structural and is proportional to the membrane area. Another is nonlinear component associated with the mobile charge of prestin, which flips in the electric field on conformational changes. Nonlinear capacitance has been described under load-free condition, at which it is expected to be the largest. Since constraint on the membrane area almost eliminates the nonlinear component~\\cite{ai1999}, it could be expected that constrains on the cell reduces this component and it in turn reduces the attenuation of receptor potential by RC filtering. This feedback would improve the performance OHCs, particularly at at high frequencies. This effect still needs to be described quantitatively. Previous treatments used either load-free capacitance~\\cite{ha1992,odi2003a,Mistrik2009,maoil2013} or the linear capacitance alone~\\cite{Johnson2011,ospeck2012}.\n\nHere a model is presented for describing the motion of a single OHC under elastic and viscous loads. The model should lead to the known behavior in the two limits: load-free displacement and force generation in the isomeric condition. In addition, the predicted membrane capacitance must lead to the known behavior in the load-free limit. \n\n\\section{The model}\\label{sec:model}\nHere a system involving an OHC is described by writing down the equations for the motile mechanism, the receptor potential, and the equation of motion. These equations are interrelated and they constitute a set of simultaneous equations, which are examined in the subsequent sections.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t] \n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{schemat4.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small{Mechanical connectivity and the equivalent electric circuit.

In the equivalent circuit (B) of the hair cell, the hair bundle resistance is $r_a$, the basolateral resistance $R_m$, and the total membrane capacitance of the basolateral membrane $C_m$.

Here a one-dimensional model is used instead of a membrane model~\\cite{i2001} for simplicity. Assume that the cell has $n$ motile elements, which has two discrete states, compact and extended, and transition from the compact state to the extended state, the cell length increases by $a$ and the electric charge $q$ flips across the plasma membrane. Let $P$ the fraction of the motile units in the extended state. Its equilibrium value $P_\\infty$ follows the Boltzmann distribution,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:distr}\nP_\\infty=\\frac{\\exp[-\\beta\\Delta G]}{1+\\exp[-\\beta\\Delta G]},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\beta=1/(k_BT)$, where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T$ the temperature, and \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta G=q(V-V_{1/2})-aF\n\\label{eq:G}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta G=q(V-V_{1/2})-aF\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01643.tex", "nexttext": " \nwhere $\\eta$ is the drag coefficient, and $m$ the mass.\n\nIf the rhs of Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:x} is small, the force applied to the external spring and that to the cell are nearly equal.

The sources of elastic and viscous loads will be elaborated in the beginning of Discussion (Section \\ref{subsection:loads}).\n\n\\subsection{Receptor potential}\nThe motile response of the cell is driven by the receptor potential, generated by the receptor current, which is, in turn, elicited by changes in the hair bundle resistance by mechanical stimulation.  This current is driven by the sum of two electromotive forces. One is  $e_K$, which is primarily determined by the K$^+$  conductance of the basolateral membrane of the cell. The other is the endocochlear potential $e_{ec}$, which is generated by the stria vascularis, a tissue that lines a part of the scala media  (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:system}B). \n\nThe magnitude of the receptor potential is determined not only changes in the hair bundle conductance but also the basolateral conductance because the electric current through the apical membrane must be equal to that through the basolateral membrane. Changes in the membrane potential produces not only ionic currents but also a capacitive current proportional to the regular capacitance in the basolateral membrane. In addition, they flip the charge of the motile units, produces an additional current, similar to the capacitive current. Thus, Kirchhoff's law leads to,\n\\begin{eqnarray} \\label{eq:potential}\n\\frac{e_a-V}{r_a}&=&\\frac{V-e_K}{R_m}+C_0\\frac{dV}{dt}-nq\\frac{dP}{dt}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $r_a$ is the apical membrane resistance, which is dominated by mechanotransducer channels in the hair bundle.

The apical membrane capacitance is ignored for simplicity. \n\nThe last term on the rhs of Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:potential} is an additional displacement current due to the charge movement in the motile elements.  It has the negative sign because a voltage increase results in an decrease in $P$ as mentioned earlier.

That corresponds to describing $P_\\infty$ as a function of $V$  under the condition of $K=0$. Thus, Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:distr} is accompanied by $\\Delta G=qV$ instead of Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:energy}. This equation has the same form as the one that has been used for fit experimental data~\\cite{a1987}.\n\n\\subsection{Isometric force generation}\nIsometric force generation per voltage changes can be obtained by evaluating $dF/dV$ from the equation $x=F/k+anP_\\infty$ with Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:distr} and $\\Delta G=[q(V-V_{1/2})-aF]$ for a given length $x$.

Because of mechanoelectric coupling, the load on the motile element reciprocally affects polarization $p$. Changes in polarization, therefore, contribute to the membrane capacitance, which attenuates the receptor potential $v$.

Because of mechanoelectric coupling, the load on the motile element reciprocally affects polarization $p$. Changes in polarization, therefore, contribute to the membrane capacitance, which attenuates the receptor potential $v$. For this reason, the total membrane capacitance $C_m$ must depend on the mechanical load. \n\nIn the following, special cases are examined.

In addition, experimental values are available for the maximal value of nonlinear capacitance $\\beta n q^2/4$, the axial stiffness of the cell $\\tilde{k}$, and isometric force production $dF/dV$. The parameter values are listed in Table \\ref{table:paramvals}.\n\nFor numerical examination, assume that the cell length of the OHC is 30 $\\mu$m and that the motor is 40 \\% in the elongated state in the natural length and the receptor potential is generated by 10\\% change in the resting hair bundle resistance $r_a$, which corresponds to the condition where 30\\% of the mechanotransducer channels are open.  \n\nHere we now examine the consistency with an assumption we made for deriving the equation of motion (Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:motion}). Recall that the minimal value of the stiffness of the motile element is $4/(\\beta a^2n)$ at $P_\\infty= 1/2$ (Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:k}). For the present set of the parameter values, the value for this stiffness is $0.27$ N/m, larger than $0.016$ N/m for the intrinsic stiffness $k$. Thus this set of parameter values is consistent with the assumption made earlier. \n\nThe consistency of the one-dimensional model is tested by comparing its predicted values and experimental values for force generation $dF/dV$ and the stiffness $\\tilde{k}$. The predicted values are within experimental errors (Table \\ref{table:paramvals}).\n\n\n\\section{Dependence on elastic load}\\label{sec:elastic_load} \n\nFrom here on, a mass-free system is examined ($m=0$) for simplicity, and numerical examination is performed using the parameter values in Table \\ref{table:paramvals}. Non-zero mass introduces an additional time constant, requiring examining a larger number of cases. In addition, the mass may depends on the frequency because it may include fluid mass \\cite{fw1988}, and hair cell mass may not constitute a major part of the mass \\emph{in vivo}.\n\n\\subsection{Membrane capacitance}\nThe factor with which an external elastic load $K$ affects the membrane capacitance is $ \\gamma a^2 n \\tilde{K}$ (See Eqs.\\ \\ref{eq:capK} and \\ref{eq:Cm@m=0}). Since $\\tilde{K}\\rightarrow k$  for $K\\rightarrow \\infty$, the maximum value of this factor is $(1/4) \\beta a^2 nk$ at $\\bar{P}=1/2$. For our set of parameter values, the maximum value of this factor is 0.11, indicating that this factor is rather small even though it is not negligible at low frequencies ($\\omega\\ll\\omega_{\\eta 0}$). For $\\omega\\gg\\omega_{\\eta 0}$, nonlinear capacitance diminishes and so does the effect of an elastic load on the membrane capacitance. \n\nIn the range where $\\omega$ is comparable to the viscoelastic characteristic frequency $\\omega_{\\eta 0}$, however, the effect of the elastic load $K$ appears mainly through the characteristic viscoelastic frequency $\\omega_{\\eta 0}(=\\tilde{K}/\\eta)$. For a given frequency $\\omega$, an increase in the elastic load $K$ increases $\\omega_{\\eta 0}$ through $\\tilde{K}$ and thus increases the capacitance $C_m$.\n\n\n\\subsection{Energy output}\nThe system has two characteristic frequencies, $\\omega_\\eta$ and $\\omega_{RC}$. Here the effect of the elastic load $K$ is examined.  The stiffness $k$ of the cell has been determined by experiments (Table \\ref{table:paramvals}). Two characteristic frequencies of the system leads to two cases, which are examined here: $\\tilde{\\omega}_\\eta \\gg \\omega_{RC}$ and $\\tilde{\\omega}_\\eta \\sim \\omega_{RC}$. It should be noticed, while $\\omega_{RC}$ is independent of $K$, $\\tilde{\\omega}_\\eta$ goes up as $K$ increases. The  energy $E_e$ conveyed to the external elastic load $K$ per half cycle can be obtained by evaluating $(1/2) K |x|^2=(1/2) K \\cdot |(\\tilde{K}/K) na p|^2$ and the work $E_d$  against viscous drag per half cycle is $(1/2)\\eta\\omega|x|^2=(1/2)\\eta\\omega\\cdot |(\\tilde{K}/K) na p|^2$.\n\n\\subsubsection{small viscous drag ($\\omega\\ll\\omega_{\\eta 0}$)}\\label{subsubsection:small_eta}\nHere examine a case in which the drag coefficient $\\eta$ is extremely small and viscous loss is negligible. Let $\\eta=10^{-10}$ Kg/s. This value satisfies the condition $\\omega_\\eta \\gg \\omega_{RC}$ except for diminishing $K$. This condition is satisfied even with increasing external elastic load $K$ to $\\sim10k$. At a given frequency, an increase in the amplitude of the receptor potential with increasing external elastic load $K$ is too small to notice in the plot (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:small_eta}A). With a given elastic load, the amplitude of the receptor potential monotonicaly decreases with increasing frequency (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:small_eta}A).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!] \n\\begin{center} \n\\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm}\\textbf{A}  \\end{minipage}  \\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm} \\textbf{B}  \\end{minipage}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{sd_rp.pdf} \\ \\ \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{sd_ew.pdf} \n\\caption{\\small{Small viscous drag ($\\omega_\\eta \\gg \\omega_{RC}$).

For a given frequency, elastic energy output per half cycle has a maximum with respect to the external elastic load $K$ at the load ratio $K/k\\approx1$ (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:small_eta}B). The optimal ratio is not significantly affected by the frequency. Work output monotonically decreases with the frequency (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:small_eta}B). The plot also shows that decrease of energy with frequency is less steep at larger load.\n Asymmetry increases with increasing frequency, while the peak ratio $K/k$ remains virtually unchanged.  \n\n\\subsubsection{larger viscous drag ($\\omega\\sim\\omega_{\\eta 0}$)}\n If the viscous drag is larger, the receptor potential decreases with increasing the stiffness ratio $K/k$ for a given frequency (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}A). This result may appear counterintuitive because it is the opposite an increase, be it rather small, under the condition of small drag. This reversal is due to a change in the time constant. The membrane capacitance increases with increasing elastic load, owing to decreasing $\\omega/\\omega_{\\eta 0}$ in Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:Cm@m=0}. An increase in the membrane capacitance increases RC attenuation, resulting in a reduction of the receptor potential. The frequency dependence of the receptor potential is monotonic. However, smallest elastic load makes the slope steeper at higher frequencies (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}A).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!] \n\\begin{center} \n\\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm}\\textbf{A}  \\end{minipage}  \\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm} \\textbf{B}  \\end{minipage}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{md_rp.pdf}\\ \\ \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{md_ew.pdf}\\\\\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm}\\textbf{C}  \\end{minipage}  \\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm} \\textbf{D}  \\end{minipage}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{md_vw.pdf}\\ \\ \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{md_po.pdf}\\\\\n\\caption{\\small{ The effect of elastic load ($\\omega_\\eta \\sim \\omega_{RC}$).

The load ratio $K/k$ that maximizes the work is close to two for low frequencies, unlike with lower viscous drag. In addition, for higher frequencies the ratio that maximizes energy output increases significantly (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}B). The maximal value at the frequency $f_0$(=4kHz) is about 0.23 aJ at $K/k=1.5$.\n\nThe work against viscous drag per half cycle decreases with increasing frequency (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}C). It also decreases monotonically with increasing stiffness ratio $K/k$ unlike the work against the elastic load. For this reason, the comparison of magnitude with elastic work heavily depends on the ratio $K/k$. The work against viscous drag is much larger than the work against elastic load if the elastic load is small. At $K/k=1.5$, the value at the frequency $f_0$ is 0.4 aJ, still larger than than the value 0.23 aJ for the elastic work.\n\nPower output can be obtained by multiplying the work against drug per half cycle by twice the frequency $2f$. It is less frequency dependent, even though it still decreases with increasing frequency (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}D). \n\n\\section{Dependence on viscous load}\nHere we examine the effect of the viscous load for fixed values of the elastic load.  Two values of the external load would be of interest: One of them is the case in which the the stiffness of the external elastic load is similar to the internal stiffness of the cell. The other is the case without an external elastic load. The former condition is presumably close to the physiological condition and the output in the form of elastic energy would be appreciable. The latter case is also of interest, even though it would not be physiological because it provides the maximal work against the viscous drag. Here we somewhat arbitrarily use $\\eta_0=10^{-6}$ kg/s as the unit of drag coefficient.\n\n\\subsection{$K=k$}\nThe receptor potential significantly increases with increasing viscous drag (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:drag_effect}A). A higher drag coefficient leads to less steep decline of the membrane potential with increasing frequency in the middle range of the plot  (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:drag_effect}A). \n\nThe work against the elastic load per per half cycle decreases with increasing drag as well as frequency  (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:drag_effect}B), as intuitively expected. At frequency $f_0$, it ranges from 0.4 aJ for low drag. At $\\eta=2\\eta_0$, the value is about 0.2 aJ.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm}\\textbf{A}  \\end{minipage}  \\begin{minipage}[b]{5cm} \\textbf{B}  \\end{minipage}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ml_rp.pdf} \\ \\ \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ml_ew.pdf}\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm}\\textbf{C}  \\end{minipage}  \\begin{minipage}[b]{5cm} \\textbf{D}  \\end{minipage}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ml_vw.pdf} \\ \\ \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{ml_po.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small{The effect of the drag coefficient $\\eta$ in the presence of elastic load.\n\\textbf{A:} The amplitude (in mV) of the receptor potential.\n\\textbf{B:} The work (in aJ) against the elastic load during a half cycle.\n\\textbf{C:} The work (in aJ) against the viscous drag during a half cycle.\n\\textbf{D:} Power output (in fW) working against the viscous drag.\n  $\\eta_0=1.0\\times 10^{-6}$ kg/s. $K/k=1$.\n}}\n\\label{fig:drag_effect}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe work against the viscous drag per half cycle monotonically decreases with the frequency.

The maximal output at the frequency $f_0$ is 5.2 fW.\n\n\\subsection{K=0}\nAt a given frequency, work against viscous drag is maximal at $K=0$, i.e. in the absence of an external elastic load (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}). For this reason it is interesting to examine the system without external elastic load to evaluate the limit even though such a condition may not be physiological.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm}\\textbf{A}  \\end{minipage}\\\\  \n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{nl_rp.pdf}\\\\\n\\begin{minipage}[b]{5cm} \\textbf{B}  \\end{minipage}\\ \\ \\begin{minipage}[b]{6cm}\\textbf{C}  \\end{minipage}  \\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=6cm]{nl_vw.pdf}\\ \\ \\includegraphics[width=6cm]{nl_po.pdf} \n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small{The effect of the drag coefficient $\\eta$ in the absence of elastic load.\n\\textbf{A:} The amplitude (in mV) of the receptor potential.\n\\textbf{B:} The work (in aJ) against viscous drag during a half cycle.\n\\textbf{C:} Power output (in fW) working against the viscous drag.\n  $\\eta_0=1.0\\times 10^{-6}$ kg/s.\n}}\n\\label{fig:drag_only}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nThe receptor potential increases with increasing viscous load and decreases with increasing frequency (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:drag_only}A).

The power output shows dependence on the drag and frequency similar to the work per half cycle does, even though the frequency dependence is less steep  (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:drag_only}C). The maximal power output is about 10 fW.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:disc}\nHere the sources of mechanical loads are briefly discussed at first.  That is followed by the effects of loads on the receptor potential and energy balance of an OHC.\n\n\\subsection{Elastic and viscous loads}\\label{subsection:loads}\nSo far we proceeded without identifying the sources of the mass $m$, the external elastic load $K$, or the drag coefficient $\\eta$. It is likely that the major part of the mass is external to the cell because an OHC is a small part of the organ of Corti, which moves with the basilar membrane on acoustic stimulation. The elements that can contribute to the external elastic load consist of the basilar membrane and local elastic elements in the organ of Corti. Contribution of these elements to the external load would depend on the mode of motion of this tissue and outside of the OHC. In the case of viscous drag $\\eta$, the sources can be within the cell, the outer surface of the cell, or other cells and structures outside of the OHC. Voltage-dependent displacement of OHC requires movement of internal fluid, which may incur viscous drag. \n\nFor obtaining an estimate of the internal drag, it would be reasonable to assume a cylindrical geometry for the OHC and the value $0.7$ kg/(m$\\cdot$s) of water for the viscosity of the internal fluid.  The velocity the fluid is null in the middle and linearly increase towards the two ends, where it reaches $(1/2)an\\cdot dP/dt$. A crude estimate could be obtained by using Poiseuille's law, which predicts the drag is $8\\pi v\\ell \\times(\\mathrm{viscosity})$, where $\\ell$ is the length of the cylinder and $v$ the velocity of the fluid. If we can use the mean fluid velocity,  the resulting drag coefficient  is $\\sim2\\times10^{-10}$ kg/s, somewhat larger than the value $10^{-10}$ kg/s used for our low drag condition (Section \\ref{subsubsection:small_eta}) and much smaller than $\\eta_0\\; (=10^{-6}$ kg/s) used elsewhere in the numerical examination.\n\nThis estimate, however, could still be an overestimate because the lateral membrane moves together with the fluid and unlikely to create a velocity gradient in the fluid as large as Poiseuille's law assumes. The internal drag could be less important than the drag on the outer surface, where the fluid motion can be more complex and should depend on the modes of motion of the whole tissue. In the following discussion, we assume that the major part of the drag $\\eta$ is external, for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Receptor potential}\nThe numerical examination shows that the receptor potential is affected by an increase of elastic load and that of drag quite differently. While an increase in drag always increase the receptor potential (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:drag_effect}A), an increase in the elastic load increases the receptor potential only slightly if drag is small (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:small_eta}A) but it decreases the receptor potential if drag is larger (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}A). These observations suggest that drag is more effective than elastic load in enhancing the receptor potential that powers the cell's motility. \n\n\\subsection{Amplifier gain}\nThe functional significance of OHCs as the cochlear amplifier depends on the balance between energy input and output. \nThe energy required for stimulating the hair bundle consists of two components. One is elastic and the other is dissipative. The elastic component is recovered in the next cycle of stimulation during sustained oscillation. The work against viscous drag cannot be recovered. Therefore the balance of this energy has been considered critical for the sensitivity and sharp tuning of the ear \\cite{g1948}. \n\nThe present model allows an evaluation of OHC's output, which compensates for the dissipated energy for hair bundle stimulation. Examination of force or energy balance in the cochlea, however, cannot be made without a certain assumption on the mode of motion in the cochlea \\cite{odi2003a,Ramamoorthy2012a}. \n\nIn the following, input and output of energy are compared on cellular level. For this comparison, output values obtained under the condition $K\\approx k$ and $\\eta \\approx 2 \\eta_0$ are used so that the two kinds of outputs can be realized at the same time.\n\n\\subsection{Amplifier gain -- dissipative energy}\nThe dissipative energy required for input has been evaluated only for frog hair saccular bundles \\cite{Bormuth2014}.  It is likely that the drag within the hair bundles of mammalian outer hair cells is much smaller than those of frogs.  Frog hair bundles are $\\sim10 \\mu$m tall, about 10 times taller than those of outer hair cells, and they are conical, consisting of tightly packed stereocilia of relatively similar lengths. Mammalian cochlear hair bundles consist of stair-like three rows of stereocilia with significantly different lengths. This morphological difference makes the gap area between stereocilia, in which shear is applied to the fluid during stimulation, much less in mammalian hair bundles than that in frog hair bundles. \n\nA crude estimation gives at least a 20-fold difference from this factor alone. In addition, stereocilia of mammalian hair bundles have larger root separations, further reducing internal drag. The tip displacement for full gating is $\\sim$100 nm \\cite{Bormuth2014} for frog hair bundles. A similar displacement is expected for mammalian hair bundles with uniform stimulation \\cite{Nam2015}.\n\nFor these reasons, a frog hair bundle should have a friction coefficient much larger than the hair bundle of an OHC. Nonetheless, it could be used as an interesting reference point.\nFull gating of frog hair bundle stimulated at 100 $\\mu$m/s with amplitude $\\sim$100 nm generates viscous force $\\sim$20 pN \\cite{Bormuth2014}. Thus energy dissipation is $10^{-19}$ J/half cycle for $f=500$ Hz for full gating. Thus 3\\% gating corresponds to $3\\times10^{-21}$ J/half cycle. If we extrapolate for higher frequencies, $2.4\\times10^{-20}$ J/half cycle for frequency of 4 kHz. This value is smaller than $0.6$ aJ (or $6\\times10^{-19}$ J)  by a factor 40 (See Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:drag_effect}B). Since frog hair bundles should have a much larger drag coefficient than mammalian ones, the the difference must be much larger. This discrepancy should allow OHCs to counteract drag generated elsewhere in the organ of Corti.\n\n\\subsection{Amplifier gain -- elastic energy}\nInput and output of elastic energy are readily compared. The observed stiffness of the hair bundle of outer hair cells is between 1 to 3 mN/m~\\cite{kenn-fet2005}. The hair bundle displacement required for 3 \\% change in the bundle conductance (or resistance) is $\\sim$0.03 nm \\cite{kenn-fet2005}. Thus the energy required for changing the conductance by 3\\% is $1.5$ aJ in the most efficient condition based on 1 mN/m bundle stiffness. The elastic energy output obtained from the model is $\\sim0.2$ aJ at 4 kHz (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:large_eta}B). It is 0.4 aJ even for small viscous drag (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:small_eta}B).\n\nIt is possible that the experimental value could be somewhat overestimated. It is extremely difficult to stimulate a hair bundle  with an experimental probe as coherently as under physiological conditions~\\cite{Nam2015}. If the gating of the channels in \\emph{in vitro} settings is less coherent than in physiological conditions, the hair bundle sensitivity is less, requiring a larger displacement for achieving a given change in the conductance.  This leads to a larger elastic energy for stimulation because a larger displacement more than compensates a smaller stiffness as explained in the following.  \n\nConsider that a hair bundle is an assembly of identical stereocilia pairs with a mechanotransducer channel between them. If an external force applied to the hair bundle is conveyed to stereocilia pairs evenly, the bundle stiffness is the sum of the pairs and the gating distance is the same as one of the pairs. The energy required to open all channels is the sum of energy required for moving the bundle along the distance to gate a single channel between every pair. If the external force is applied non-uniformly, the stiffness of the bundle as a whole is less than the sum of the pairs but the distance required for opening all channels is larger than that for a pair. That means a larger mechanical work because each pair with a given stiffness must be displaced more if the bundle is displaced non-uniformly.\n\nSince elastic energy is conserved it is unnecessary for the output of an amplifier to match the input. Oscillation would be facilitated if the output partially compensates the input. Nonetheless it is interesting to notice that the order of magnitudes of input and output are close.\n\n\\section{Concluding remarks}\nIn this paper, a simple model for electromotility of OHCs is proposed to describe its behavior in a dynamic environment. The model is consistent with the experimental data so far obtained from isolated OHCs. The model also extends the expression for the membrane capacitance, incorporating the effects of frequency, drag, elastic load, and an associated mass. \n\nThis model enables to describe the receptor potential and energy production by an OHC while its hair bundle is mechanically stimulated by sinusoidal waveform. It was found that the receptor potential is more significantly affected by the viscous drag than an elastic load.  The model predicts that the output of elastic energy is close to the input. However, the output of dissipative energy is much larger than input. These results are consistent with the biological role of the OHCs as an amplifier.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nDiscussion with Dr.\\ Charles Steele and Yanli Wang motivated to start the present work at Stanford, partially supported by NIH 5R01DC00791008 to Stanford University.
