In this article by subhalos we mean all halos within 400 kpc from the Galactic center (roughly the virial radius). We include all subhalos in VL-II that are well resolved in the VL-II simulation, i.e. those more massive than $\\sim 10^5 M_{\\odot}$.\nWe compare our predicted number of detectable subhalos to the number of dark matter subhalo candidate sources in 3FGL  identified in Ref. \\cite{bertoni} to place upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section.

In section \\ref{3fglsection}, we discuss the 3FGL source catalog of Fermi LAT and the energy flux thresholds we use to define subhalo detectability.

We make use in this paper of the Via Lactea II (VL-II) simulation \\cite{vl2}, which includes only dark matter particles and does not take into account baryonic effects.\nThe simulated MW halo contains numerous smaller substructures, as predicted by the $\\Lambda$CDM theory of hierarchical structure formation. The smallest subhalos resolved in VL-II are $\\sim 10^{5} M_{\\odot}$.\nWe discard all subhalos at a distance greater than 400 kpc (approximately the virial radius of the Milky Way) from the Galactic center, since small halos (compared to the host mass of $\\sim 10^{12} M_{\\odot}$) at larger radii are unlikely to produce interesting results.\n\nIn this work, we model the density profiles of the VL-II subhalos using a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)  \\cite{NFW} profile\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{nfw1}\n\\rho(r) = \\frac{\\rho_{s}}{\\left( \\frac{r}{r_{s}} \\right) \\left[ 1 + \\left( \\frac{r}{r_{s}} \\right) \\right]^{2}}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\rho(r)=\\frac{\\rho_{s}}{\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{s}}\\right)\\left[1+\\left(\\frac{r}{r_{%&#10;s}}\\right)\\right]^{2}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>s</mi></msub><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>r</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>r</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06781.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $ \\frac{d N}{d E_{\\gamma}} $ is the number of photons per photon energy produced per annihilation, $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ is the relative velocity of the particles times the annihilation cross-section, averaged over the velocity distribution, $m_{\\chi} $ is the dark matter particle mass, and $J$ (the ``astrophysical'' term) is given by\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 7056, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\rho_{s}$ and $r_{s}$, the scale density and scale radius, respectively, are characteristics of individual halos.

In total, this catalog contains 3034 sources, many of which are associated with Active Galactic Nuclei or pulsars, thanks to astronomical studies at other wavelengths. There are 992 sources, however, that have not been associated with emission at other wavelengths. A subset of these are expected to be pulsars and AGN that have {\\it not yet} been associated.  Sources that were not associated in earlier Fermi LAT catalogs have subsequently been associated with pulsars or AGN in 3FGL, and the same is expected to happen with more multi-wavelength data for many of the unassociated sources in 3FGL (see, e.g., the analysis of unassociated 2FGL sources in \\cite{Mirabal:2012em}). However, there remains the possibility that a subset of the unassociated sources might be dark matter subhalos.\n\nWe will compare our predicted number of detectable subhalos to the number of {\\it candidate} dark matter subhalos in 3FGL as found by \\citet{bertoni}. Discarding time-variable unidentified sources, they performed spectral tests to determine the compatibility of the spectra of the unidentified sources with WIMP annihilation spectra. For unidentified sources which they identified as spectrally compatible with dark matter subhalos, they provided dark matter mass ranges for which the annihilation spectra provide good fits to the data in the case of annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$, based on a chi-squared analysis.\nThe number of compatible unidentified sources as a function of dark matter mass, as found by \\cite{bertoni}, is shown in the right panel of Fig. \\ref{mdisflux_NFW}.\nThe relatively large number of candidate sources corresponding to dark matter masses of 20 $-$ 40~GeV are likely pulsars, as typical gamma-ray pulsar spectra are similar to those for a dark matter particle in that mass range annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$~\\cite{Baltz:2006sv}. \n\nOur aim is to predict the number of dark matter subhalos that might be present as unidentified point sources in the 3FGL catalog. Therefore, we want to define the detectability of a source according to the threshold for inclusion in 3FGL.\nIn the left panel of Fig.~\\ref{efluxhistscombined}, the energy flux distributions of sources in 3FGL at $|b|>10^{\\circ}$ are shown for the photon energy range 100 MeV $-$ 100 GeV and for the photon energy range 1 GeV $-$ 100 GeV. The peaks of the distribution are at $\\sim 4.0 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$ and $\\sim 1.35 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$, respectively.\nThe figure also shows that the energy flux above 1 GeV of the faintest source in 3FGL is $\\sim 4.0 \\cdot 10^{-13} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\n\nWe expect dark matter annihilation spectra to be harder than the gamma-ray spectra produced by pulsars and blazars, that is, we expect gamma rays from dark matter annihilations to have in general higher energies than gamma rays from blazars or pulsars \\cite{fermi3fgl}. Because many unidentified sources are expected to be blazars or pulsars, we choose not to use the detectability threshold inferred from the energy flux distribution in the range \\hbox{100 MeV $-$ 100 GeV}, but rather that inferred from the energy flux distribution in the range 1 GeV $-$ 100 GeV. \n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{paper2016_thesis_efluxhistscombined}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{paper2016_thesis_eflux10-100gev}\n\\caption{Energy flux distribution of sources at high Galactic latitude ($|b| > 10^{\\circ}$) in the Fermi LAT 3FGL source catalog, in different photon energy ranges: \\emph{Left:} 100 MeV to 100 GeV (blue) and 1 GeV to 100 GeV (green); \\emph{Right:} 10 GeV to 100 GeV.\\label{efluxhistscombined}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nAs a conservative detectability threshold, we will take the energy flux above 1 GeV corresponding to the peak of the distribution: $F_{\\text{cons}} \\equiv F_{> 1 \\: \\text{GeV}} = 1.35 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$. We expect the catalog to be complete down to the peak of the distribution, i.e., all sources with fluxes above the peak value have been detected regardless of their spectra. Therefore, we are confident this is a conservative detectability threshold.\nAs a (very) optimistic detectability threshold, we will take the energy flux above 1 GeV corresponding to the energy flux of the faintest source in 3FGL: $F_{\\text{opt}} \\equiv F_{> 1 \\: \\text{GeV}} = 4.0 \\cdot 10^{-13} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\n \nBecause the gamma-ray spectrum resulting from dark matter annihilations to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is harder than that produced in annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$, the energy flux in the range 10 $-$ 100 GeV is higher in the case of annihilations to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ than in the case of annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$. Therefore, we expect more detectable sources for dark matter annihilating to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ than for annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$ if we use a detectability threshold inferred from the energy flux distribution of sources in 3FGL in the energy range 10 $-$ 100 GeV. \nThe peak of the energy flux distribution of 3FGL sources in this energy range is \\hbox{$4.43 \\cdot 10^{-13}  \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$} (right panel of Fig. \\ref{efluxhistscombined}), and we will use this detectability threshold, denoted by $F_{\\text{cons}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}}$, in the case of annihilations to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$.\n\n\nWe exclude all subhalos in VL-II with latitudes smaller than 10 degrees, because a point source at lower latitude --- that is, closer to the Galactic Plane --- would be much harder to detect due to the strong Galactic background and would therefore have to have a higher energy flux than the threshold we inferred from the energy flux distribution of sources in 3FGL at latitudes above 10 degrees.\n\n\\section{Results}\\label{results-section}\n\\subsection{Number of detectable subhalos}\nThe VL-II halo provides a model of the Milky Way, but it cannot capture the orientation of the Galactic disk, much less the specific location of the Earth within this simulated halo. A realistic assumption is that the Galactic disk should be coinciding with the plane perpendicular to the major axis of the dark matter halo. Because the $z$-direction in VL-II is roughly coincident with the major axis of the halo, we assume the Galactic plane to be corresponding to $z = 0$. To generate multiple realisations of the dark matter subhalo population around Earth, we placed the observer at 8.5 kpc (roughly the distance from the Galactic center to Earth) from the center of the halo and rotate it around this point in the $x, y$-plane, keeping the distance to the Galactic center constant. \n\nFigure \\ref{goedgoed_M_N_40_3*10^(-25)_NFW_planck_tt} shows the number of detectable subhalos as a function of subhalo mass, in the case of annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$ and $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, respectively. In both plots, a relatively high annihilation cross-section of $3 \\cdot 10^{-25} \\: \\text{cm}^{3} \\: \\text{s}^{-1}$ is assumed, to illustrate the typical masses of detectable subhalos.

Fig. \\ref{goedgoed_M_N_40_3*10^(-25)_NFW_planck_tt} confirms this expectation: there are no detectable subhalos in the still well-resolved $10^{5} M_{\\odot}$ mass range. Using observable quantities in VL-II to define subhalo density distributions, we have not made assumptions regarding the effect of tidal stripping, as opposed to \\cite{bertoni}.\n\nIn our results we have also shown the number of spatially extended sources that would be detectable. However, this result should be critically assessed: in calculating this number, we have not performed a line-of-sight integral of the dark matter density squared, rather, we integrated the density squared out to the \\hbox{68 \\%} containment angle at 1 GeV of Fermi LAT. Moreover, we used a detectability threshold corresponding to the threshold for the inclusion of point sources in 3FGL, whereas spatially extended sources are less detectable than point sources due to the challenges of background modelling \\cite{fermi3fgl}.\n\nAdopting the peak of the energy flux distribution above 1 GeV of sources in 3FGL as the energy flux threshold for inclusion in 3FGL, we have found that $2.8 \\pm 0.8$ subhalos in a Milky Way-like halo would be detectable with Fermi LAT as a point source at 5-sigma level in the case of a 40 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$-quarks at a thermal cross-section. This is compatible with the findings of \\citet{pieri}.\nIf we instead take an optimistic approach by taking the energy flux above 1 GeV of the faintest source included in 3FGL as the threshold for inclusion in 3FGL, we find $9.8 \\pm 1.6$ detectable subhalos.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{paper_goed_bb_upperlimits_95}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{paper_goed_tt_upperlimits_95}\n\t\t\\caption{95 \\% confidence level upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section as function of the dark matter particle mass $m_{\\chi}$, in the case of $100 \\%$ annihilation into $b\\bar{b}$ (\\emph{left}) and $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ (\\emph{right}). The solid line represents the constraint that would have been obtained if there were no dark matter subhalo candidate sources in 3FGL. The dashed line represents the constraint taking into account the population of candidate sources as provided by \\cite{bertoni}. Candidate sources are compatible with dark matter annihilation spectra at 95 \\% confidence level. The dotted line corresponds to a thermal cross-section. Subhalos are considered detectable if their gamma-ray energy flux above 1 GeV exceeds $F_{\\text{cons}}$ (\\emph{left}) or if their gamma-ray energy flux above 10 GeV exceeds $F_{\\text{cons}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}}$ (\\emph{right}).\\label{upperlimits}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFor a 100 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ at a thermal cross-section, a scenario that has not yet been excluded by the most stringent upper limits on the annihilation cross-section set by Fermi LAT in their combined dwarf analysis (\\cite{fermidwarfs}), we predict $4.5 \\pm 0.8$ detectable point-like subhalos using the energy flux above 1 GeV of the faintest source in 3FGL as the threshold for detectability. Although this choice of threshold is probably too optimistic, this result does indicate that even though no significant gamma-ray emission was observed from dwarf galaxies, we might still expect to find dark matter subhalos among the unidentified sources of Fermi LAT.\n\nOur results are slightly in tension with the results of \\citet{bertoni}. Whereas we predicted $\\sim 3$ detectable subhalos for a 40 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$, \\citet{bertoni} predicted $\\sim$ 10 detectable subhalos for the same dark matter particle parameters and a slightly more conservative detectability threshold. For this reason, our upper limits on the annihilation cross-section using the dark matter subhalo candidate population in 3FGL from \\cite{bertoni} are slightly weaker than those presented in \\cite{bertoni}. We identify the origin of this discrepancy in their optimistic choice of dark matter density profile. As discussed in Ref. \\cite{berlinhooper}, the authors of Ref. \\citet{bertoni} describe halos with an Einasto profile, and by comparing the mass fraction in subhalos in the local volume with the mass fraction in subhalos at the virial radius of a halo in the Aquarius simulation, they assume the halos lose 99.5 \\% of their initial mass due to tidal stripping, without modifying the density profile within the tidal radius. This means that a $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ stripped halo has a scale radius corresponding to a $2 \\cdot 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ halo before tidal stripping. In Fig. \\ref{BHLeinasto} we compare the density profile of a $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ halo used in our analysis with the corresponding profile used in \\cite{bertoni}.\n\nIf we consider a $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ subhalo after tidal stripping, in the analysis of \\cite{bertoni} this subhalo had a mass of $2 \\cdot 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ before infall into the host halo. Following \\cite{bertoni} in adopting the concentration-mass relation presented in \\cite{sanchezconde}, a $2 \\cdot 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ halo with a density distribution described by the Einasto profile used by \\cite{bertoni} has a scale radius (the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the profile equals -2) of 0.42 kpc (using a NFW profile, the halo would have a scale radius of 0.33 kpc instead).\nThe radius within which $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ is contained is 0.056 kpc. Thus, the authors of Ref. \\cite{bertoni} assume that even the parts {\\it within} the scale radius of a halo get destroyed due to tidal effects. However, the tidal radii --- defined as the radius at which the density of the subhalo is equal to the density of the host halo \\cite{vl2} --- of the subhalos in VL-II are larger than their scale radii. This means that the matter within the scale radii of the subhalos in VL-II have survived tidal stripping, in contradiction with the assumption of \\cite{bertoni}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{paper_BHLeinasto10_7_python}\n\\caption{Comparison of the NFW profile we assigned to a $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ halo in VL-II with the Einasto profile \\citet{bertoni} assigned to the same halo before tidal stripping. \\label{BHLeinasto}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe main conclusions from our analysis can be summarised as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item{} In the case of a 40 GeV WIMP annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ at a thermal cross-section, we predict between $2.8 \\pm 0.8$ (using a conservative detectability threshold) and $9.8 \\pm 1.6$ (using an optimistic detectability threshold) dark matter subhalos among the unidentified sources of 3FGL. \n\n\\item{} For a 100 GeV WIMP annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ at a thermal cross-section, a scenario that is not excluded by current constraints, we predict $4.5 \\pm 0.8$ dark matter subhalos in 3FGL using an optimistic detection threshold.\n\n\\item{} We placed upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section using our results obtained for a conservative detectability threshold. These limits are competitive with constraints by other studies in the case that there are no dark matter subhalo candidates in 3FGL.\n\n\\item{} Our results are in tension with those of \\citet{bertoni}, due to their overly optimistic assumptions concerning the amount of tidal stripping.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nNote added: As we were finalising our work, a new analysis by \\citet{zhu} showed that the stellar disk of a Milky Way-size galaxy may substantially deplete subhalos near the central region. The total number of low-mass subhalos in their hydrodynamic simulation is roughly half the number that are in a dark-matter--only simulation. If confirmed, this effect would further reduce the detectability of dark matter subhalos.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nWe would like to thank Christoph Weniger, Mark Lovell, and Arianna di Cintio for useful discussions, and Francesca Calore, Dan Hooper, and Christoph Weniger for comments on the manuscript.

In total, this catalog contains 3034 sources, many of which are associated with Active Galactic Nuclei or pulsars, thanks to astronomical studies at other wavelengths. There are 992 sources, however, that have not been associated with emission at other wavelengths. A subset of these are expected to be pulsars and AGN that have {\\it not yet} been associated.  Sources that were not associated in earlier Fermi LAT catalogs have subsequently been associated with pulsars or AGN in 3FGL, and the same is expected to happen with more multi-wavelength data for many of the unassociated sources in 3FGL (see, e.g., the analysis of unassociated 2FGL sources in \\cite{Mirabal:2012em}). However, there remains the possibility that a subset of the unassociated sources might be dark matter subhalos.\n\nWe will compare our predicted number of detectable subhalos to the number of {\\it candidate} dark matter subhalos in 3FGL as found by \\citet{bertoni}. Discarding time-variable unidentified sources, they performed spectral tests to determine the compatibility of the spectra of the unidentified sources with WIMP annihilation spectra. For unidentified sources which they identified as spectrally compatible with dark matter subhalos, they provided dark matter mass ranges for which the annihilation spectra provide good fits to the data in the case of annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$, based on a chi-squared analysis.\nThe number of compatible unidentified sources as a function of dark matter mass, as found by \\cite{bertoni}, is shown in the right panel of Fig. \\ref{mdisflux_NFW}.\nThe relatively large number of candidate sources corresponding to dark matter masses of 20 $-$ 40~GeV are likely pulsars, as typical gamma-ray pulsar spectra are similar to those for a dark matter particle in that mass range annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$~\\cite{Baltz:2006sv}. \n\nOur aim is to predict the number of dark matter subhalos that might be present as unidentified point sources in the 3FGL catalog. Therefore, we want to define the detectability of a source according to the threshold for inclusion in 3FGL.\nIn the left panel of Fig.~\\ref{efluxhistscombined}, the energy flux distributions of sources in 3FGL at $|b|>10^{\\circ}$ are shown for the photon energy range 100 MeV $-$ 100 GeV and for the photon energy range 1 GeV $-$ 100 GeV. The peaks of the distribution are at $\\sim 4.0 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$ and $\\sim 1.35 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$, respectively.\nThe figure also shows that the energy flux above 1 GeV of the faintest source in 3FGL is $\\sim 4.0 \\cdot 10^{-13} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\n\nWe expect dark matter annihilation spectra to be harder than the gamma-ray spectra produced by pulsars and blazars, that is, we expect gamma rays from dark matter annihilations to have in general higher energies than gamma rays from blazars or pulsars \\cite{fermi3fgl}. Because many unidentified sources are expected to be blazars or pulsars, we choose not to use the detectability threshold inferred from the energy flux distribution in the range \\hbox{100 MeV $-$ 100 GeV}, but rather that inferred from the energy flux distribution in the range 1 GeV $-$ 100 GeV. \n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{paper2016_thesis_efluxhistscombined}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{paper2016_thesis_eflux10-100gev}\n\\caption{Energy flux distribution of sources at high Galactic latitude ($|b| > 10^{\\circ}$) in the Fermi LAT 3FGL source catalog, in different photon energy ranges: \\emph{Left:} 100 MeV to 100 GeV (blue) and 1 GeV to 100 GeV (green); \\emph{Right:} 10 GeV to 100 GeV.\\label{efluxhistscombined}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nAs a conservative detectability threshold, we will take the energy flux above 1 GeV corresponding to the peak of the distribution: $F_{\\text{cons}} \\equiv F_{> 1 \\: \\text{GeV}} = 1.35 \\cdot 10^{-12} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$. We expect the catalog to be complete down to the peak of the distribution, i.e., all sources with fluxes above the peak value have been detected regardless of their spectra. Therefore, we are confident this is a conservative detectability threshold.\nAs a (very) optimistic detectability threshold, we will take the energy flux above 1 GeV corresponding to the energy flux of the faintest source in 3FGL: $F_{\\text{opt}} \\equiv F_{> 1 \\: \\text{GeV}} = 4.0 \\cdot 10^{-13} \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\n \nBecause the gamma-ray spectrum resulting from dark matter annihilations to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ is harder than that produced in annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$, the energy flux in the range 10 $-$ 100 GeV is higher in the case of annihilations to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ than in the case of annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$. Therefore, we expect more detectable sources for dark matter annihilating to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ than for annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$ if we use a detectability threshold inferred from the energy flux distribution of sources in 3FGL in the energy range 10 $-$ 100 GeV. \nThe peak of the energy flux distribution of 3FGL sources in this energy range is \\hbox{$4.43 \\cdot 10^{-13}  \\: \\text{erg}/\\text{cm}^{2}/\\text{s}$} (right panel of Fig. \\ref{efluxhistscombined}), and we will use this detectability threshold, denoted by $F_{\\text{cons}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}}$, in the case of annihilations to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$.\n\n\nWe exclude all subhalos in VL-II with latitudes smaller than 10 degrees, because a point source at lower latitude --- that is, closer to the Galactic Plane --- would be much harder to detect due to the strong Galactic background and would therefore have to have a higher energy flux than the threshold we inferred from the energy flux distribution of sources in 3FGL at latitudes above 10 degrees.\n\n\\section{Results}\\label{results-section}\n\\subsection{Number of detectable subhalos}\nThe VL-II halo provides a model of the Milky Way, but it cannot capture the orientation of the Galactic disk, much less the specific location of the Earth within this simulated halo. A realistic assumption is that the Galactic disk should be coinciding with the plane perpendicular to the major axis of the dark matter halo. Because the $z$-direction in VL-II is roughly coincident with the major axis of the halo, we assume the Galactic plane to be corresponding to $z = 0$. To generate multiple realisations of the dark matter subhalo population around Earth, we placed the observer at 8.5 kpc (roughly the distance from the Galactic center to Earth) from the center of the halo and rotate it around this point in the $x, y$-plane, keeping the distance to the Galactic center constant. \n\nFigure \\ref{goedgoed_M_N_40_3*10^(-25)_NFW_planck_tt} shows the number of detectable subhalos as a function of subhalo mass, in the case of annihilations to $b\\bar{b}$ and $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, respectively.

We did not have this information for the case of annihilations to $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, and for this scenario we therefore only present the optimistic upper limits on the annihilation cross-section corresponding to the absence of any candidate dark matter subhalos in 3FGL, in the right panel of Fig. \\ref{upperlimits}.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{paper2_N_mchi_thermal_bbcons}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{paper2_N_mchi_thermal_ttcons}\n\\caption{Number of detectable point-like (blue) and spatially extended (green) subhalos plotted against dark matter particle mass $m_{\\chi}$, for a thermal cross-section and annihilation into $b\\bar{b}$ (\\emph{left}) and annihilation into $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ (\\emph{right}). The error bars correspond to 1 sigma due to rotating the observer position around the Galactic Center.\\label{paper2_N_mchi_thermal_bbcons}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\section{Discussion and conclusions}\\label{discussion-section}\nWhile other studies \\cite[e.g.][]{bertoni} have used a mass function and radial distribution of subhalos in the Milky Way as determined from numerical simulations and then extrapolated to masses below the resolution limits of these simulations, we avoid the uncertainties associated with these extrapolations by restricting our study to halos above the mass resolution limit --- we do not expect the subhalos below the mass resolution limit to be detectable anyway, since such halos would have to be unrealistically close; see the left panel of Fig. \\ref{mdisflux_NFW}. Fig. \\ref{goedgoed_M_N_40_3*10^(-25)_NFW_planck_tt} confirms this expectation: there are no detectable subhalos in the still well-resolved $10^{5} M_{\\odot}$ mass range. Using observable quantities in VL-II to define subhalo density distributions, we have not made assumptions regarding the effect of tidal stripping, as opposed to \\cite{bertoni}.\n\nIn our results we have also shown the number of spatially extended sources that would be detectable. However, this result should be critically assessed: in calculating this number, we have not performed a line-of-sight integral of the dark matter density squared, rather, we integrated the density squared out to the \\hbox{68 \\%} containment angle at 1 GeV of Fermi LAT. Moreover, we used a detectability threshold corresponding to the threshold for the inclusion of point sources in 3FGL, whereas spatially extended sources are less detectable than point sources due to the challenges of background modelling \\cite{fermi3fgl}.\n\nAdopting the peak of the energy flux distribution above 1 GeV of sources in 3FGL as the energy flux threshold for inclusion in 3FGL, we have found that $2.8 \\pm 0.8$ subhalos in a Milky Way-like halo would be detectable with Fermi LAT as a point source at 5-sigma level in the case of a 40 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$-quarks at a thermal cross-section. This is compatible with the findings of \\citet{pieri}.\nIf we instead take an optimistic approach by taking the energy flux above 1 GeV of the faintest source included in 3FGL as the threshold for inclusion in 3FGL, we find $9.8 \\pm 1.6$ detectable subhalos.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{paper_goed_bb_upperlimits_95}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{paper_goed_tt_upperlimits_95}\n\t\t\\caption{95 \\% confidence level upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section as function of the dark matter particle mass $m_{\\chi}$, in the case of $100 \\%$ annihilation into $b\\bar{b}$ (\\emph{left}) and $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ (\\emph{right}). The solid line represents the constraint that would have been obtained if there were no dark matter subhalo candidate sources in 3FGL. The dashed line represents the constraint taking into account the population of candidate sources as provided by \\cite{bertoni}. Candidate sources are compatible with dark matter annihilation spectra at 95 \\% confidence level. The dotted line corresponds to a thermal cross-section. Subhalos are considered detectable if their gamma-ray energy flux above 1 GeV exceeds $F_{\\text{cons}}$ (\\emph{left}) or if their gamma-ray energy flux above 10 GeV exceeds $F_{\\text{cons}, \\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}}$ (\\emph{right}).\\label{upperlimits}}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFor a 100 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ at a thermal cross-section, a scenario that has not yet been excluded by the most stringent upper limits on the annihilation cross-section set by Fermi LAT in their combined dwarf analysis (\\cite{fermidwarfs}), we predict $4.5 \\pm 0.8$ detectable point-like subhalos using the energy flux above 1 GeV of the faintest source in 3FGL as the threshold for detectability. Although this choice of threshold is probably too optimistic, this result does indicate that even though no significant gamma-ray emission was observed from dwarf galaxies, we might still expect to find dark matter subhalos among the unidentified sources of Fermi LAT.\n\nOur results are slightly in tension with the results of \\citet{bertoni}. Whereas we predicted $\\sim 3$ detectable subhalos for a 40 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$, \\citet{bertoni} predicted $\\sim$ 10 detectable subhalos for the same dark matter particle parameters and a slightly more conservative detectability threshold. For this reason, our upper limits on the annihilation cross-section using the dark matter subhalo candidate population in 3FGL from \\cite{bertoni} are slightly weaker than those presented in \\cite{bertoni}. We identify the origin of this discrepancy in their optimistic choice of dark matter density profile. As discussed in Ref. \\cite{berlinhooper}, the authors of Ref. \\citet{bertoni} describe halos with an Einasto profile, and by comparing the mass fraction in subhalos in the local volume with the mass fraction in subhalos at the virial radius of a halo in the Aquarius simulation, they assume the halos lose 99.5 \\% of their initial mass due to tidal stripping, without modifying the density profile within the tidal radius. This means that a $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ stripped halo has a scale radius corresponding to a $2 \\cdot 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ halo before tidal stripping. In Fig. \\ref{BHLeinasto} we compare the density profile of a $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ halo used in our analysis with the corresponding profile used in \\cite{bertoni}.\n\nIf we consider a $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ subhalo after tidal stripping, in the analysis of \\cite{bertoni} this subhalo had a mass of $2 \\cdot 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ before infall into the host halo. Following \\cite{bertoni} in adopting the concentration-mass relation presented in \\cite{sanchezconde}, a $2 \\cdot 10^7 M_{\\odot}$ halo with a density distribution described by the Einasto profile used by \\cite{bertoni} has a scale radius (the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the profile equals -2) of 0.42 kpc (using a NFW profile, the halo would have a scale radius of 0.33 kpc instead).\nThe radius within which $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ is contained is 0.056 kpc. Thus, the authors of Ref. \\cite{bertoni} assume that even the parts {\\it within} the scale radius of a halo get destroyed due to tidal effects. However, the tidal radii --- defined as the radius at which the density of the subhalo is equal to the density of the host halo \\cite{vl2} --- of the subhalos in VL-II are larger than their scale radii. This means that the matter within the scale radii of the subhalos in VL-II have survived tidal stripping, in contradiction with the assumption of \\cite{bertoni}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{paper_BHLeinasto10_7_python}\n\\caption{Comparison of the NFW profile we assigned to a $10^7 M_{\\odot}$ halo in VL-II with the Einasto profile \\citet{bertoni} assigned to the same halo before tidal stripping. \\label{BHLeinasto}}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe main conclusions from our analysis can be summarised as follows:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item{} In the case of a 40 GeV WIMP annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ at a thermal cross-section, we predict between $2.8 \\pm 0.8$ (using a conservative detectability threshold) and $9.8 \\pm 1.6$ (using an optimistic detectability threshold) dark matter subhalos among the unidentified sources of 3FGL. \n\n\\item{} For a 100 GeV WIMP annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ at a thermal cross-section, a scenario that is not excluded by current constraints, we predict $4.5 \\pm 0.8$ dark matter subhalos in 3FGL using an optimistic detection threshold.\n\n\\item{} We placed upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section using our results obtained for a conservative detectability threshold. These limits are competitive with constraints by other studies in the case that there are no dark matter subhalo candidates in 3FGL.\n\n\\item{} Our results are in tension with those of \\citet{bertoni}, due to their overly optimistic assumptions concerning the amount of tidal stripping.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nNote added: As we were finalising our work, a new analysis by \\citet{zhu} showed that the stellar disk of a Milky Way-size galaxy may substantially deplete subhalos near the central region. The total number of low-mass subhalos in their hydrodynamic simulation is roughly half the number that are in a dark-matter--only simulation. If confirmed, this effect would further reduce the detectability of dark matter subhalos.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nWe would like to thank Christoph Weniger, Mark Lovell, and Arianna di Cintio for useful discussions, and Francesca Calore, Dan Hooper, and Christoph Weniger for comments on the manuscript.
