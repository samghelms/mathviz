In the limit that $\\delta t\\to 0$, i.e.~the standard QZD scenario, this evolution becomes $\\exp(-i H_Z^{(1)} \\tau)$, with $H_Z^{(1)}$ being the standard Zeno Hamiltonian \\cite{facchi2008}, recovering the QZD result. However, when $\\delta t$ is small-but-finite, we have the more general QqZD scenario, where the quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians $H_Z^{(k)}$ mediate $k$th-order transitions where the initial and final states are in the measurement subspace ${\\mathcal{P}}$, but intermediate states are not. Because of the dependence of each quasi-Zeno Hamiltonian's contribution to the effective Hamiltonian on increasing powers of $\\delta t$, each one is less significant than that of the previous order, and the intimate dependence of QqZD on the measurement timestep is evident.\n\nIn the standard QZD regime, the effective Hamiltonian is simply the Zeno Hamiltonian $H_Z^{(1)}$, which, being Hermitian, leads to unitary dynamics. Contrastingly, the quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians are not. Due to the second-order quasi-Zeno Hamiltonian $H_Z^{(2)}$ being non-vanishing for any non-trivial Hamiltonian and measurement operator when $\\delta t$ is finite, in the quasi-Zeno regime the dynamics is non-unitary. Instead, the dynamics of the system will tend towards the eigenstate of $H_Z^{(2)}$ with lowest eigenvalue that can be accessed by the dynamics from the (quasi-)Zeno Hamiltonians. This state essentially minimises the rate of higher-order processes the system undergoes, and forms an effective steady-state of the dynamics. However, this state is fragile, as it requires the measurement value to be unchanging; while each individual measurement has a neglible probability of changing, after many, the transition probability across all measurements can become non-negligible.\n\n\\subsubsection{Interpretation}\nPhysically, the QqZD second-order terms involve a small-but-finite occupation of an intermediate state between measurements, which is then removed by the projection of the subsequent measurement, provided the locking of the measurement eigenvalue is maintained. While this intermediate state is occupied, it can transition to other states as usual for the non-measurement case. These transitions can either be to states also outside of the measurement subspace (in which case occupation of these states is also removed by the next measurement), or back in to the measurement subspace, but not necessarily into the original state. Higher-order terms involve transitions with additional intermediate states. When the time between measurements decreases, the maximum occupation of the intermediate states will also be decreased, and hence the rate of transitions out of these states will be lessened. This is reflected in the form of the effective Hamiltonians and their dependence on $\\delta t$. In the infinitely frequent measurement limit of QZD, there is no occupation of the intermediate states, and thus there are no transitions beyond first-order. \n\nBecause of the locking to the measurement subspace, occupation of the intermediate states is never directly observed. However, through the occurence of transitions that take place via these states, their temporary occupation may be indirectly inferred. As a result of this, and because the dynamics can be described by effective Hamiltonians acting only on the measurement subspace, allowing a description of the intermediate states to be omitted, these states outside of the measurement subspace can be viewed as virtual states, and consequently, that the transitions between states in the measurement subspace that pass through these virtual states can be seen as virtual processes. Similar transitions via such virtual states are also present in the continuous, non-projective measurement case \\cite{mazzucchi2015, kozlowski2015}, where they are compared with Raman-like processes.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure1.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\bf Transitions via virtual processes}: The quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians give rise to transitions that occur via states outside the measurement subspace, which can be viewed as virtual processes.

We can construct a similar picture for the virtual processes of QqZD, where the incoming and outgoing lines are the initial and final states in the measurement subspace, the vertices are the transitions between states, and the internal lines correspond to occupation of the intermediate states. In this representation, the number of vertices corresponds to the number of transitions, and hence the order of the quasi-Zeno process; transitions described by the Zeno Hamiltonian $H_Z^{(1)}$ have one vertex and no virtual states, as they do not require occupation of the intermediate states, whilst transitions from the second-order quasi-Zeno Hamiltonian $H_Z^{(2)}$ are represented by two vertices and one virtual state. Second-order processes that return back to the same initial state can be considered akin to self-interacting processes, giving rise to self-energy type contributions to the Hamiltonian. We note however, that this analogy is intended as a graphical aid to interpret the transitions within the QqZD framework, and we are not proposing that the mathematics of the processes described by Feynman diagrams be directly mapped onto QqZD.\n\nTo further illustrate these virtual processes, we use a very basic toy model consisting of the simplest system that can exhibit non-trivial QqZD: a three state system where two states possess a degenerate measurement eigenvalue.

The particle is subject to a transverse field of strength $\\lambda$, such that it has Hamiltonian $H=\\lambda S^X$, and frequent measurement is made of the magnitude of its spin value ($A=|S^Z|$). The Hamiltonian contains no direct transitions between the ${|{{-1}}\\rangle}$ and ${|{{1}}\\rangle}$ states, instead requiring two-step processes that go first via the ${|{{0}}\\rangle}$ state. Thus, in such a setup in the standard QZD scenario, the Zeno Hamiltonian vanishes; $H_Z^{(1)}=0$.

This effect has been extended to encompass the case of degenerate measurement subspaces, where multiple states of the system possess identical outcomes of the measured observable, such that evolution within this subspace is unhindered by the measurement, a phenomenon called quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD) \\cite{facchi2000, facchi2002, facchi2008}. The QZE and QZD have been observed in a range of experimental setups, including ions \\cite{itano1990}, photons \\cite{kwiat1995}, NMR \\cite{xiao2006}, atoms in microwave cavities \\cite{signoles2014}, Bose-Einstein condensates \\cite{streed2006,schafer2014}, and Rydberg atoms \\cite{patil2015}. There has also been much theoretical interest in the field, particularly because of the opportunities offered by measurement-based control of a system \\cite{nakazato2003, nakazato2004, erez2004, wu2004, compagno2004, militello2004, wang2008, erez2008, pazsilva2012, raimond2012, burgarth2013, everest2014, stannigel2014, elliott2015a, mazzucchi2015, elliott2015b}.\n\nIt has been shown that even when consecutive measurements are finitely spaced, the locking to a measurement subspace can still occur \\cite{layden2015}. However, in this case, the description of the system evolution solely in terms of this subspace is incomplete \\cite{dhar2015}; the finite time between measurements allows higher-order processes to occur, where the system first transitions away from the measurement subspace, and then subsequently back in to it before the next measurement, thus preserving the value of the measured observable. Similar effects have been predicted for continuous measurement in the quantum jump formalism \\cite{mazzucchi2015, kozlowski2015}.\n\nIn this article we demonstrate how these higher-order processes, which we call quantum quasi-Zeno dynamics (QqZD), arise from perturbative considerations of standard QZD. We find effective Hamiltonians to describe the evolution of the system, and suggest interpreting such processes as virtual transitions, providing a simple illustrative example using a three-level system. We extend the formalism to encompass time-dependent Hamiltonians, non-equally- and stochastically-spaced measurements, and discuss how transitions to different measurement subspaces may be incorporated into the treatment. We then apply this formalism to exhibit how this phenomena may manifest in two archetypal examples of many-body systems, spin chains and atoms in optical lattices, where we show that the higher-order processes correspond to correlated dynamics in the system.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsubsection{Fundamentals of QqZD}\nConsider a system evolving under Hamiltonian $H$. Between measurements, the evolution of the quantum state $\\rho$ after time $t$ is described by the unitary operator $U(t)=\\exp(-iHt)$,  through $\\rho\\to U\\rho U^\\dagger$ \\cite{dirac1967principles} (we use natural units $\\hbar=1$). This system is subject to measurement from an external source, and we model the effect of a measurement of the observable $A=\\sum_j A_j {\\mathcal{P}}_j$ with outcome $A_k$ to modify the state according to $\\rho\\to {\\mathcal{P}}_k \\rho {\\mathcal{P}}_k$, where ${\\mathcal{P}}_k$ is the projector for the subspace containing all states with measurement eigenvalue $A_k$ (see Methods).\n\nIn this formalism, we can describe the evolution of a system subject to frequent measurement. For two consecutive measurements a time $\\delta t$ apart, a state $\\rho$ initially in eigenspace ${\\mathcal{P}}$ of the measurement operator evolves $\\rho\\to{\\mathcal{P}}'U(\\delta t)\\rho U^\\dagger(\\delta t){\\mathcal{P}}'$, where ${\\mathcal{P}}'$ is the subspace of the measurement outcome. In the limit where $H\\delta t$ is small, we can calculate the probability that the measurement outcome changes. The probability that the measurement results in a value corresponding to subspace ${\\mathcal{Q}}\\neq{\\mathcal{P}}$ is given by $P({\\mathcal{Q}})={\\mathrm{Tr}}(H \\rho H {\\mathcal{Q}})\\delta t^2.$  Summing this over all measurement subspaces different to ${\\mathcal{P}}$, we have the condition that for the probability of a change in the measurement value to occur to be neglible, we require $\\sum_{{\\mathcal{Q}}} P({\\mathcal{Q}})\\ll 1$, which can be expressed over-strictly for any initial state in ${\\mathcal{P}}$ as $\\sum_{{\\mathcal{Q}}} {\\mathcal{P}} H {\\mathcal{Q}} H {\\mathcal{P}} \\delta t^2 \\ll 1$. This forms our `Zeno-locking' requirement on timescales for the periods between measurements. From here, we assume this condition is met.\n\nAfter $N\\gg1$ such measurements in a time $\\tau=N\\delta t$, each resulting in the same measurement value, with subspace ${\\mathcal{P}}$, the effective evolution operator can be written (see Methods for details)\n$U_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\tau)=\\exp(-i H_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\tau)$, with the corresponding effective Hamiltonian \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eqHeff}\nH_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-i\\delta t)^{k-1}}{k!}H_Z^{(k)},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-i\\delta t)^{k-1}}{k!}H_{Z}^{(k)},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>eff</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><munderover><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></munderover><mrow><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo lspace=\"0pt\" rspace=\"3.5pt\">!</mo></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>H</mi><mi>Z</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06624.tex", "nexttext": "\nand hence allows transitions between the $|S^Z|=1$ states, by sequentially undergoing two transitions, to and from state ${|{{0}}\\rangle}$, while this intermediate state is never observed to be occupied, and thus this transition appears as a virtual process.

Generalisation to non-equal timesteps between measurements is straightforward. The form of the quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians are unchanged, but the dependence on $\\delta t$ now leads to differing strengths of the $H_Z$ between each measurement in the effective Hamiltonian. We can modify the effective evolution to account for this by including a sum over all the different measurement timesteps.

This generalisation also allows for systems where the measurement timestep depends on a stochastic process (for example, the decay of a particle) to be described. If the variance in the timesteps for such a process is sufficiently narrow, an `average' trajectory could be considered by calculating the moments $\\langle\\delta t^n\\rangle$, with an average number of measurements $\\langle N\\rangle = \\tau/\\langle \\delta t\\rangle$.\n\nThus far, we have taken the measurements to occur sufficiently close together that the measurement outcome can be assumed to be constant. However, it is possible to relax this condition, still with measurement occuring much more frequently than changes to the measured value, and describe the system evolution by a straightforward extension to the QqZD formalism. Between changes in the measurement value, the system is described by the appropriate QqZD effective evolution operator for this subspace. When the measurement eigenvalue changes, from a value corresponding to subspace with projector ${\\mathcal{P}}$ to that of subspace with projector ${\\mathcal{P}}'$, the change in the state is $\\rho\\to{\\mathcal{P}}'H{\\mathcal{P}}\\rho{\\mathcal{P}} H{\\mathcal{P}}'$, from the leading term $\\mathcal{O}(\\delta t^2)$ allowing transitions out of the measurement subspace. After the measurement, the system is again described by a QqZD effective evolution operator, but now that corresponding to the new subspace. In an experimental run, one can simply determine when this change in subspace occurs by observing when the measurement value changes. \n\n\\subsubsection{Application to Many-Body Systems}\nMany-body systems often possess interesting properties that are described by observables dependent on the collective state of multiple particles. Different configurations of particles can still result in the same system-wide measurement value for this observable; such configurations hence correspond to the same measurement subspace. This makes many-body systems a suitable arena for QqZD, and we shall here provide examples of many-body systems, along with associated observables formed of linear functions of the occupation numbers of the system modes, showing how this can lead to correlated dynamics.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure2a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure2b.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\bf Correlated processes in spin chains}: Multiple configurations of spins (a) belong to the same measurement subspace.

Dynamics changing this magnetisation are forbidden by the Zeno-locking, and thus the standard Zeno Hamiltonian contains  only spin-exchange between neighbouring spins with either both, or neither, in the measured regions. \n\nHowever, the higher-order quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians mediate correlated spin-exchange events, where multiple pairs of spins flip approximately simultaneously between measurements, conserving the total magnetisation measured. In the second-order $H_Z^{(2)}$, these processes contain two such correlated exchanges, involving only pairs that straddle the measurement region boundaries, and can be of two forms: in the first, both exchanges happen between the same pair, but in opposite directions, thus leaving the individual spins unchanged; in the second, the two pairs are distinct, with one exchange increasing the total magnetisation of the measurement region, while the other decreases it. These processes are illustrated in {Fig.~\\ref{{figspins}}}(b). In the latter case, the there is no restriction on the spatial seperation of the two pairs, and hence these processes can be correlated over long distances; this then resembles a superexchange interaction \\cite{kramers1934, anderson1950}, but with the potential for longer seperation betwen the pairs.\n\nAnalogous processes can be considered for atoms in an optical lattice. In state-of-the-art setups, lattices containing bosonic atoms have been generated inside optical cavities \\cite{landig2015, klinder2015}, and these setups allow for functions of the atomic occupation of each site to be measured through the leakage of light from the cavity after having been scattered by the atoms \\cite{mekhov2007, elliott2015a}. In the absence of measurement, and with negligible cavity-backaction, the atoms behave according to the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian \\cite{jaksch1998} $H=\\sum_{i}-J(b^\\dagger_ib_{i+1}+h.c.) + Ub^\\dagger_ib^\\dagger_ib_ib_i$, where where $b_i$ is the bosonic annihilation operator for an atom localised at site $i$, $J$ parameterises the rate of atomic hopping between neighbouring sites, and $U$ is the strength of on-site interactions between atoms.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{./Figure3a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{./Figure3b.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure3c.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\bf Correlated atomic processes}: (a) Frequent, consistent measurement of the occupation of a set of sites facilitates correlated tunnelling of atoms over the boundaries of the measured region, while (b) measuring occupation number differences gives rise to pair process-like effects.

In {Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(a) we illustrate how measuring the total occupation of a central region mediates long-range correlated tunnelling events across the boundaries of the region. We also illustrate a scenario offered by considering the difference in occupation numbers; measurement of the difference in occupation of two sites/regions gives rise to correlated events resembling pair processes, where tunnelling events in to or out of a particular site/region can only occur in pairs, in order to preserve the measurement value, as shown in {Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(b). We demonstrate this with a small-scale simulation [{Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(c)] of four lattice sites showing the transfer of atoms across the measured region, a process forbidden in standard QZD, along with the single tunnelling events between the sites in the measured region as described by the standard Zeno Hamiltonian (see Methods for details). \n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nWe have shown how, beyond the freezing of the observed value of a frequently repeated measurement of a system manifest by QZE/QZD, it is possible for dynamics to still take place across different states in the measurement subspace, even in the absence of direct transitions between them, via higher-order virtual processes that arise through transitions that take the system temporarily out of the measurement subspace, without altering the consistent outcome of the measurement value. We developed this QqZD formalism, and derived effective Hamiltonians to describe the system evolution. We generalised to incorporate measurements with non-equal timesteps and time-dependent Hamiltonians, and how the state and evolution of the system change when the measurement value changes. We showed that this regime generates correlated dynamics in many-body systems.\n\nWhilst being relatively simple both mathematically and conceptually, this regime has previously been largely unexplored, despite the abundance of possibilities for which it lays the foundations. The field of dissipative dynamics, where the interactions between a system and its environment can be exploited to manipulate the dynamics of a system, and to prepare particular states of the system, has seen a lot of interest \\cite{beige2000, verstraete2009, yi2012, everest2014, stannigel2014}, as has the very related field of using designed measurement as the source of dissipation for quantum system engineering \\cite{mekhov2009, pedersen2014, elliott2015a, elliott2015b, mazzucchi2015b}. This work extends these ideas, as by eliminating particular processes at first-order only, whilst preserving them at second-order (or higher), can lead to the emergence of correlated dynamics, as demonstrated here. An experimental realisation of this regime would potentially be less taxing than similar experiments of standard QZE and QZD, as the requirement on the time between measurements is less stringent. The possible obstacles we foresee are the need to maintain the coherence of the system for sufficiently long times to witness the higher-order effects, and that for verification of these effects, a second observable must be measured at the start and end of the protocol that can distinguish states in the measurement subspace.\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure4a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure4b.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure4c.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\bf Comparison of effective Hamiltonian to exact evolution and QZD}: (a) Exact evolution of the system simulated in {Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(c). (b) Evolution under the Zeno Hamiltonian of QZD for the same system fails to capture correlated processes. (c) Difference between results for exact and effective evolution; the primary error is in capturing the first-order dynamics, and scales linearly with $\\delta t$ (see main text). Simulations use 4 sites, 10 atoms, $\\delta t J=10^{-3}$, $U=0$, with measurement imposing the constraint $N_2+N_3=5$.}\n\\label{figsims}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nHere we provide details on the derivation of QqZD, and clarify assumptions made about the system evolution. Firstly, we justify modelling the system as evolving under unitary evolution between measurements. This is true in general for an isolated, closed quantum system. Appealing to the so-called church of higher Hilbert space (CHHS) \\cite{vedral2006introduction}, an ancilla can be appended to the system to account for the effect of an environment, such that the total system-ancilla evolution is unitary, even if the system dynamics alone is not. If the measurement outcome depends only on the system state, and is independent of the ancilla state, then the inclusion of the ancilla does not affect the QqZD result - one has simply to trace out the ancilla from the QqZD evolution in the same manner as usual for recovering the system dynamics from a CHHS treatment. A second simplification made in our treatment is that we treat the measurement as von Neumann projections. This is in keeping with the simple derivations of QZE and QZD \\cite{misra1977, facchi2008}, which have subsequently been extended to more general settings, including coupling to external `measurement devices' \\cite{ruseckas2001}. These treatments that incorporate the measurement device recover QZE when the time taken for the external device to measure the system state is much shorter than the system dynamics. It has also been shown that even when the measurements are not perfectly projective, QZE can still persist \\cite{layden2015}. Thus, we expect when these realistic concerns are incorporated into our simplified picture of measurement, the results should be preserved.\n\nIn deriving the effective evolution for QqZD, we make use of some important properties of projectors; they are idempotent and mutually orthogonal (${\\mathcal{P}}_j{\\mathcal{P}}_k={\\mathcal{P}}_j\\delta_{jk}$), and together span the entire Hilbert space ($\\sum_j {\\mathcal{P}}_j={\\mathbb{I}}$) \\cite{nielsen2000quantum}. As noted in the Results, the effect on state $\\rho$ of unitary evolution followed by a projective measurement is described by $\\rho\\to{\\mathcal{P}} U(\\delta t)\\rho U^\\dagger(\\delta t){\\mathcal{P}}$. Defining $U_1(\\delta t) = {\\mathcal{P}} U(\\delta t)$, this can be written $\\rho\\to U_1(\\delta t)\\rho U_1^\\dagger(\\delta t)$. Following $N$ such sets of evolution and measurement in a total time $\\tau=N\\delta t$, where each measurement outcome was in the same subspace ${\\mathcal{P}}$, we can describe the resulting state by $U_N(\\tau)\\rho U^\\dagger_N(\\tau)$, where $U_N(\\tau)=U_1(\\delta t)^N=({\\mathcal{P}} U(\\delta t))^N$. Expanding $U(\\delta t)$ as a power series in terms of the Hamiltonian $H$, we hence have\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 18845, "prevtext": "\nWith the evolution written explicitly in terms of each measurement timestep, we can also clearly see how time-dependent Hamiltonians may be incorporated into the formalism, at least for cases where they can be treated as being approximately piecewise constant between measurements, by generalising the quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians $H_Z^{n}(t)={\\mathcal{P}} H(t)^n{\\mathcal{P}}$ in the above effective evolution, and imposing appropriate time-ordering. This generalisation also allows for systems where the measurement timestep depends on a stochastic process (for example, the decay of a particle) to be described. If the variance in the timesteps for such a process is sufficiently narrow, an `average' trajectory could be considered by calculating the moments $\\langle\\delta t^n\\rangle$, with an average number of measurements $\\langle N\\rangle = \\tau/\\langle \\delta t\\rangle$.\n\nThus far, we have taken the measurements to occur sufficiently close together that the measurement outcome can be assumed to be constant. However, it is possible to relax this condition, still with measurement occuring much more frequently than changes to the measured value, and describe the system evolution by a straightforward extension to the QqZD formalism. Between changes in the measurement value, the system is described by the appropriate QqZD effective evolution operator for this subspace. When the measurement eigenvalue changes, from a value corresponding to subspace with projector ${\\mathcal{P}}$ to that of subspace with projector ${\\mathcal{P}}'$, the change in the state is $\\rho\\to{\\mathcal{P}}'H{\\mathcal{P}}\\rho{\\mathcal{P}} H{\\mathcal{P}}'$, from the leading term $\\mathcal{O}(\\delta t^2)$ allowing transitions out of the measurement subspace. After the measurement, the system is again described by a QqZD effective evolution operator, but now that corresponding to the new subspace. In an experimental run, one can simply determine when this change in subspace occurs by observing when the measurement value changes. \n\n\\subsubsection{Application to Many-Body Systems}\nMany-body systems often possess interesting properties that are described by observables dependent on the collective state of multiple particles. Different configurations of particles can still result in the same system-wide measurement value for this observable; such configurations hence correspond to the same measurement subspace. This makes many-body systems a suitable arena for QqZD, and we shall here provide examples of many-body systems, along with associated observables formed of linear functions of the occupation numbers of the system modes, showing how this can lead to correlated dynamics.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure2a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure2b.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\bf Correlated processes in spin chains}: Multiple configurations of spins (a) belong to the same measurement subspace. Processes that ultimately preserve the measurement can take place, at (b$i$) first- or (b$ii$,$iii$) higher-order. Here, the measurement is signified by the total magnetisation of the green regions.}\n\\label{figspins}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor the first example, we consider an array of spins in a chain \\cite{mattis2006theory},  where each pair of neighbouring spins is coupled by an exchange interaction $S_i^+ S_{i+1}^-$, such that the full system Hamiltonian is\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "$$H=-J\\sum_i (S^+_iS^-_{i+1} + S_i^-S_{i+1}^+),$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex3.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H=-J\\sum_{i}(S^{+}_{i}S^{-}_{i+1}+S_{i}^{-}S_{i+1}^{+}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>J</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></munder><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>-</mo></msubsup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>-</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo>+</mo></msubsup></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06624.tex", "nexttext": "\nIn the full QZD limit, where $\\delta t\\to0$ and $N\\to\\infty$, this binomial expansion is exactly equal to the exponential of the Zeno Hamiltonian $U_N(\\tau)\\to\\exp(-iH_Z^{(1)}\\tau)$. Close to, but outside of this limit, we can still approximately describe this evolution by an exponential, but with the inclusion of the higher-order terms added perturbatively. These higher-order terms form the quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians, which manifest evolution between two states inside the measurement subspace, through transitions to states outside of it. The difference between these quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians and the simple products ${\\mathcal{P}} H^k {\\mathcal{P}}$ removes any processes that intermediately return to the measurement subspace, distinguishing between contributions from products of lower-order (quasi-)Zeno Hamiltonians, and their higher-order counterparts. This results in the description of the evolution by the effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ given in Eq.~\\eqref{eqHeff}. \n\nThe simulation of correlated tunnelling events shown in {Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(c) involves 10 atoms distributed across 4 sites, with the total occupation of the two central sites fixed (we use $N_2+N_3=5$). We take a measurement timestep $\\delta t J=10^{-3}$, well within the Zeno-locking regime. We have used the effective Hamiltonian Eq.~\\eqref{eqHeff}, applied to the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian with $U=0$, to describe the evolution, and here we will compare this to the exact evolution, and the standard QZD description with just the Zeno Hamiltonian [{Fig.~\\ref{{figsims}}}]. We see that qualitatively, the exact evolution and our effective evolution agree very well, with both displaying the single-body tunnelling between the central sites, the correlated tunnelling between the outer sites, and the convergence towards a steady-state. The standard QZD evolution completely fails to capture both the correlated processes and this steady-state. We also see that the primary quantitive disagreement between the exact and approximate effective evolution is in capturing the first-order processes. This is because of the discrepancy between the binomial expansion and exponential power series, and naively, can be argued to be $\\mathcal{O}({H_Z^{(1)}}^2t\\delta t)$ (up to a maximum of the largest occupation of the site), because for each quasi-Zeno Hamiltonian the discrepancy is in its associated second-order term in the evolution, thus making $H_Z^{(1)}$ responsible for the primary level of error. However, the convergence to a steady-state suppresses the dynamics, and so curtails this error to some maximum value due to the compressing of the accessible state space by $H_Z^{2}$.\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank Wojciech Kozlowski and Igor Mekhov for discussions.

We take the total magnetisation (the sum of $S^Z$ values) of a set of sites as our measurement, such that the subspaces are defined by states with the same magnetisation in this region [{Fig.~\\ref{{figspins}}}(a)]. Dynamics changing this magnetisation are forbidden by the Zeno-locking, and thus the standard Zeno Hamiltonian contains  only spin-exchange between neighbouring spins with either both, or neither, in the measured regions. \n\nHowever, the higher-order quasi-Zeno Hamiltonians mediate correlated spin-exchange events, where multiple pairs of spins flip approximately simultaneously between measurements, conserving the total magnetisation measured. In the second-order $H_Z^{(2)}$, these processes contain two such correlated exchanges, involving only pairs that straddle the measurement region boundaries, and can be of two forms: in the first, both exchanges happen between the same pair, but in opposite directions, thus leaving the individual spins unchanged; in the second, the two pairs are distinct, with one exchange increasing the total magnetisation of the measurement region, while the other decreases it. These processes are illustrated in {Fig.~\\ref{{figspins}}}(b). In the latter case, the there is no restriction on the spatial seperation of the two pairs, and hence these processes can be correlated over long distances; this then resembles a superexchange interaction \\cite{kramers1934, anderson1950}, but with the potential for longer seperation betwen the pairs.\n\nAnalogous processes can be considered for atoms in an optical lattice. In state-of-the-art setups, lattices containing bosonic atoms have been generated inside optical cavities \\cite{landig2015, klinder2015}, and these setups allow for functions of the atomic occupation of each site to be measured through the leakage of light from the cavity after having been scattered by the atoms \\cite{mekhov2007, elliott2015a}. In the absence of measurement, and with negligible cavity-backaction, the atoms behave according to the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian \\cite{jaksch1998} $H=\\sum_{i}-J(b^\\dagger_ib_{i+1}+h.c.) + Ub^\\dagger_ib^\\dagger_ib_ib_i$, where where $b_i$ is the bosonic annihilation operator for an atom localised at site $i$, $J$ parameterises the rate of atomic hopping between neighbouring sites, and $U$ is the strength of on-site interactions between atoms.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{./Figure3a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\linewidth]{./Figure3b.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure3c.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\bf Correlated atomic processes}: (a) Frequent, consistent measurement of the occupation of a set of sites facilitates correlated tunnelling of atoms over the boundaries of the measured region, while (b) measuring occupation number differences gives rise to pair process-like effects.

In {Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(a) we illustrate how measuring the total occupation of a central region mediates long-range correlated tunnelling events across the boundaries of the region. We also illustrate a scenario offered by considering the difference in occupation numbers; measurement of the difference in occupation of two sites/regions gives rise to correlated events resembling pair processes, where tunnelling events in to or out of a particular site/region can only occur in pairs, in order to preserve the measurement value, as shown in {Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(b). We demonstrate this with a small-scale simulation [{Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(c)] of four lattice sites showing the transfer of atoms across the measured region, a process forbidden in standard QZD, along with the single tunnelling events between the sites in the measured region as described by the standard Zeno Hamiltonian (see Methods for details). \n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nWe have shown how, beyond the freezing of the observed value of a frequently repeated measurement of a system manifest by QZE/QZD, it is possible for dynamics to still take place across different states in the measurement subspace, even in the absence of direct transitions between them, via higher-order virtual processes that arise through transitions that take the system temporarily out of the measurement subspace, without altering the consistent outcome of the measurement value. We developed this QqZD formalism, and derived effective Hamiltonians to describe the system evolution. We generalised to incorporate measurements with non-equal timesteps and time-dependent Hamiltonians, and how the state and evolution of the system change when the measurement value changes. We showed that this regime generates correlated dynamics in many-body systems.\n\nWhilst being relatively simple both mathematically and conceptually, this regime has previously been largely unexplored, despite the abundance of possibilities for which it lays the foundations. The field of dissipative dynamics, where the interactions between a system and its environment can be exploited to manipulate the dynamics of a system, and to prepare particular states of the system, has seen a lot of interest \\cite{beige2000, verstraete2009, yi2012, everest2014, stannigel2014}, as has the very related field of using designed measurement as the source of dissipation for quantum system engineering \\cite{mekhov2009, pedersen2014, elliott2015a, elliott2015b, mazzucchi2015b}. This work extends these ideas, as by eliminating particular processes at first-order only, whilst preserving them at second-order (or higher), can lead to the emergence of correlated dynamics, as demonstrated here. An experimental realisation of this regime would potentially be less taxing than similar experiments of standard QZE and QZD, as the requirement on the time between measurements is less stringent. The possible obstacles we foresee are the need to maintain the coherence of the system for sufficiently long times to witness the higher-order effects, and that for verification of these effects, a second observable must be measured at the start and end of the protocol that can distinguish states in the measurement subspace.\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure4a.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure4b.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{./Figure4c.pdf}\n\\caption{{\\bf Comparison of effective Hamiltonian to exact evolution and QZD}: (a) Exact evolution of the system simulated in {Fig.~\\ref{{figatoms}}}(c).

Firstly, we justify modelling the system as evolving under unitary evolution between measurements. This is true in general for an isolated, closed quantum system. Appealing to the so-called church of higher Hilbert space (CHHS) \\cite{vedral2006introduction}, an ancilla can be appended to the system to account for the effect of an environment, such that the total system-ancilla evolution is unitary, even if the system dynamics alone is not. If the measurement outcome depends only on the system state, and is independent of the ancilla state, then the inclusion of the ancilla does not affect the QqZD result - one has simply to trace out the ancilla from the QqZD evolution in the same manner as usual for recovering the system dynamics from a CHHS treatment. A second simplification made in our treatment is that we treat the measurement as von Neumann projections. This is in keeping with the simple derivations of QZE and QZD \\cite{misra1977, facchi2008}, which have subsequently been extended to more general settings, including coupling to external `measurement devices' \\cite{ruseckas2001}. These treatments that incorporate the measurement device recover QZE when the time taken for the external device to measure the system state is much shorter than the system dynamics. It has also been shown that even when the measurements are not perfectly projective, QZE can still persist \\cite{layden2015}. Thus, we expect when these realistic concerns are incorporated into our simplified picture of measurement, the results should be preserved.\n\nIn deriving the effective evolution for QqZD, we make use of some important properties of projectors; they are idempotent and mutually orthogonal (${\\mathcal{P}}_j{\\mathcal{P}}_k={\\mathcal{P}}_j\\delta_{jk}$), and together span the entire Hilbert space ($\\sum_j {\\mathcal{P}}_j={\\mathbb{I}}$) \\cite{nielsen2000quantum}. As noted in the Results, the effect on state $\\rho$ of unitary evolution followed by a projective measurement is described by $\\rho\\to{\\mathcal{P}} U(\\delta t)\\rho U^\\dagger(\\delta t){\\mathcal{P}}$. Defining $U_1(\\delta t) = {\\mathcal{P}} U(\\delta t)$, this can be written $\\rho\\to U_1(\\delta t)\\rho U_1^\\dagger(\\delta t)$. Following $N$ such sets of evolution and measurement in a total time $\\tau=N\\delta t$, where each measurement outcome was in the same subspace ${\\mathcal{P}}$, we can describe the resulting state by $U_N(\\tau)\\rho U^\\dagger_N(\\tau)$, where $U_N(\\tau)=U_1(\\delta t)^N=({\\mathcal{P}} U(\\delta t))^N$. Expanding $U(\\delta t)$ as a power series in terms of the Hamiltonian $H$, we hence have\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "$$U_N(\\tau)=\\left({\\mathcal{P}} \\left(1 - i H \\delta t - H^2 \\frac{\\delta t^2}{2}+\\mathcal{O}(\\delta t^3)\\right)\\right)^N.$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"U_{N}(\\tau)=\\left({\\mathcal{P}}\\left(1-iH\\delta t-H^{2}\\frac{\\delta t^{2}}{2}+%&#10;\\mathcal{O}(\\delta t^{3})\\right)\\right)^{N}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>U</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcab</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msup><mi>H</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcaa</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>t</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>N</mi></msup></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
