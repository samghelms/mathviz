[{"file": "1601.03647.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe concept of ``underlying Born'' phase space (${\\Phi_B}$) is central in\n{\\ttfamily POWHEG}, and we assume the reader to be familiar with it:\nonce a point in ${\\Phi_B}$ is picked, according to the weight $\\bar{B}$,\nthe hardest emission (a point in $({\\Phi_B},{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})$) is generated according\nto the {\\ttfamily POWHEG} Sudakov. The mapping ${\\Phi_B}\\to({\\Phi_B},{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})$ is\nthe same as the one used to perform the subtraction of singularities\nin $\\bar{B}$, and it depends on the singular region at\nhand~\\cite{Frixione:2007vw}. Two problems are\npresent:\\footnote{Extended explanations can be found in\n  refs.~\\cite{Campbell:2014kua,Jezo:2015aia}.}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item In the standard {\\ttfamily POWHEG BOX} algorithm, the phase\n  space region associated to final-state gluon emission off the\n  $b$-quark would be handled by a mapping that, for a generic\n  radiation, does not preserve the virtuality of the intermediate\n  resonance, \\emph{i.e.} $m^2_{Wb}({\\Phi_B})\\ne m^2_{Wbg}({\\Phi_B},{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})$. The\n  problem is manifest: unless $m^2_{bg} \\ll \\Gamma_t E_{bg}$, $R$ and\n  $B$ will not be on the resonance peak at the same time, hence the\n  ratio $R/B$ can become large when $R$ is on peak and $B$ is not,\n  yielding a ``Sudakov suppression'' that is spurious, since the\n  $({\\Phi_B},{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})$ kinematics would be far from the true QCD\n  singularity. Quantitatively, one expects the mass profile of the\n  $b$-jet to be distorted when $m^2_{jet}\\sim E_b\n  \\Gamma_t$.\n\\item A further problem can arise during the parton-showering stage:\n  from the second emission onward, the shower should be instructed to\n  preserve the mass of the resonances. This could be done easily if\n  there was an unique mechanism to ``assign'' the radiation to a given\n  resonance. For processes where interference is present, no obvious\n  choice is possible.\n\\end{enumerate}\n  \nAn intermediate solution to the previous issues was presented in\nref.~\\cite{Campbell:2014kua}, where a fully consistent NLO+PS\nsimulation for $W^+W^-b\\bar{b}$ production in the narrow-width limit\nwas obtained. Offshellenss and interference effects were implemented\nin an approximate way, as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[a.] By using matrix elements in the narrow-width limit, real and\n  virtual corrections for production and decay can be clearly\n  separated,~\\emph{i.e.} no interference arises. This also allows for\n  a non-ambiguous ``resonance assignment'' for final-state\n  radiation.\n\\item[b.] For radiation in the decay, ${\\Phi_{\\rm rad}}$ is generated by first\n  boosting momenta in the resonance rest-frame. In this way, the\n  intermediate virtuality is the same for ${\\Phi_{\\rm rad}}$ and $({\\Phi_B},{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})$.\n\\item[c.] The phase space integration, and the event generation, spans\n  also over the off-shell regions. A projection onto an on-shell\n  kinematics, tested extensively, allows to use the NLO on-shell\n  amplitudes (computed in refs.~\\cite{Campbell:2012uf,Badger:2011yu}).\n\\item[d.] From the off-shell phase space, a reweighting of the\n  $\\bar{B}$ function is performed using the LO exact results (where\n  finite width and non-double-resonant diagrams are fully included).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\\columnwidth}\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{plot_endpoint}}\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\\caption{Invariant mass distribution of the charged lepton and\n  $b$-flavored jet at NLO+PS including correction for production only\n  or for production and decay, with the method described in\n  ref.~\\cite{Campbell:2014kua}.

A further issue was\naddressed: by default in {\\ttfamily POWHEG} only the hardest emission\nis generated. However, for the $t\\bar{t}$ process, emissions from\ndecay are rarely the hardest, hence they would be dealt with by the\nshower most of the time, despite the previous improvements. In\nref.~\\cite{Campbell:2014kua} a procedure to keep, at the same time,\nthe initial state radiation as well as those from decaying resonances\nwas implemented, to alleviate the aforementioned issue. An example of\nthe results\nis illustrated in fig.~\\ref{fig:CENR14}, where the impact of the new\n{\\ttfamily POWHEG BOX} generator is shown on an ``endpoint''\nobservable typically used to extract $m_t$.\n\nFinally, I want to mention that, shortly after the conference, further\nsubstantial progress was presented in ref.~\\cite{Jezo:2015aia}. A\nmethod to handle exactly the complete matrix elements also at NLO was\ndeveloped, by partially using some of the improvements in\nref.~\\cite{Campbell:2014kua} but also generalizing substantially the\npartition of phase space into singular regions and the associated\nsubtraction scheme. Although results were published only for\nsingle-top, the method is fully general, and its application to\n$W^+W^-b\\bar{b}$ is in progress~\\cite{bb4lpaper}.\n\n\\subsection{Multijet merging at NLO}\n\\vspace{-0.05cm}\nAt large collision energies, a significant fraction of $t\\bar{t}$\nevents is produced in association with one or more jets. At times a\ntool describing several jet multiplicities in a single event sample is\nneeded. A typical example is when ``$H_T$'' variables are used, as is\noften the case in BSM searches.\n\nThe CKKW-L and MLM-merging methods succesfully address this issue at\nLO. Since this accuracy will become a limiting factor for precision\nstudies, it is desirable to extend these methods to NLO (``NLOPS\nmultijet merging''). Reaching such accuracy is a non-trivial\ntheoretical challenge, since it requires a detailed understanding of\nthe interplay among resummation and fixed order effects in NLO+PS\nsimulations. Several approaches were proposed in the literature over\nthe last three years. In the context of top-pair production, so far\nresults were published only using the {\\ttfamily\n  MEPS@NLO}~\\cite{Hoeche:2012yf,Hoeche:2014qda} and {\\ttfamily\n  FxFx}~\\cite{Frederix:2012ps} merging methods.\\footnote{A thorough\n  comparison where other approaches are also included will be\n  presented in the proceedings of the 2015 ``Physics at TeV\n  Colliders'' workshop~\\cite{LHproceedings}.} The measurement of QCD\nactivity in $t\\bar{t}$ events will allow to test these tools against data\nin ``SM dominated'' regions, thereby providing a robust assessment of\nthe accuracy that can be assumed when they are used for BSM searches.\n\n\\acknowledgments I would like to thank the organizers for the\ninvitation to the conference and the generous support to

The large value of the cross sections to produce top\nquarks at the LHC allows an experimentally accurate extraction of its\nproperties. On the other hand, the final state arising from its decay\nproducts makes top-quark production processes a background for several\nBSM searches. For these reasons it is extremely important to have\npredictions for total and differential cross sections that are precise\nenough to match the experimental accuracy. It is also crucial to model\nas accurately as possible subleading effects by including higher-order\ncorrections into event generator programs.\n\nIn this paper I review the state of the art of computations and\nsimulation tools for top-quark pair production, that is the dominant\nmechanism for producing top quarks at the LHC. In\nsection~\\ref{sec:partonic} I focus on results for total and differential\ncross sections at parton level, whereas section~\\ref{sec:MC} reviews the\ncurrent research activity devoted to the improvement of simulation\ntools.\n\n\\section{Recent improvements in the computation of total and differential cross sections}\n\\label{sec:partonic}\n\\vspace{-0.05cm}\nIn this section I will first summarize recent highlights in the\ncomputation of the $t\\bar{t}$ total and differential cross sections in\nQCD (sec.~\\ref{sec:fixed}-\\ref{sec:resum}). In the last part\n(sec.~\\ref{sec:differential}) I give the state of the art for fully\ndifferential predictions where top quark decay products are included.\n\n\\subsection{Fixed order results}\n\\label{sec:fixed}\n\\vspace{-0.05cm}\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.35\\columnwidth}\n\\vspace{-0.3cm}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{LHC8-P_Tavt-abs}}\n\\vspace{-0.1cm}\n\\caption{The top quark transverse momentum at LO, NLO and NNLO, and\n  the associated K-factors. Figure from ref.~\\cite{Czakon:2015owf}.}\n\\label{fig:Czakon15}\n\\vspace{-0.0cm}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\n\nA landmark result for top quark Physics at the LHC was obtained by the\nauthors of ref.~\\cite{Czakon:2013goa}, that have computed for the first\ntime the exact next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to\nthe total inclusive cross section $\\sigma_{tot}$, using the\nsubtraction scheme presented in ref.~\\cite{Czakon:2010td}. These\nresults show a fairly good\nconvergence of the perturbative series, with good overlap among\nuncertainty bands when going from one order to the next one. The\nagreement between theory and data is also remarkably good, as shown in\nseveral talks at this conference.\n\nDifferential distributions for $t\\bar{t}$ production are now also\nknown at NNLO in QCD. They were first published for the forward\nbackward top asymmetry in ref.~\\cite{Czakon:2014xsa}, and, very\nrecently, for other (more exclusive)\nobservables~\\cite{Czakon:2015owf}. The importance of the latter\nresults can not be underestimated. NNLO/NLO differential K factors are\ngenerally not flat, as illustrated for instance the plot in\nfig.~\\ref{fig:Czakon15}, where it is shown that NNLO corrections\nchange sizeably the shape of the top quark $p_T$ spectrum.\\footnote{\n  It has to be noticed though, that a fixed renormalization and\n  factorization scale is used in these results.} In the tail region\nseveral studies by ATLAS and CMS have shown an unsatisfactory\nagreement between data and NLO-matched event generators, with the\nlatter overshooting the measured cross section.  By including NNLO\ncorrections, the agreement is significantly improved, as also shown in\nref.~\\cite{Czakon:2015owf}.  An important refinement of these\ndifferential results will be its combination with the NNLO\ndifferential computation of the top decay, that was performed in\nrefs.~\\cite{Gao:2012ja,Brucherseifer:2013iv}.\n\nFor completeness I also recall that significant progress towards the\ncomputation of NNLO QCD corrections to total and differential\n$t\\bar{t}$ cross sections was also made by other\ngroups~\\cite{Abelof:2015lna,Bonciani:2015sha}. For instance the cross\nsection $d\\sigma/dp_{T,t\\bar{t}}$ for the transverse momentum of the\ntop pair is now known in the small $p_T$ limit at the\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic\norder~\\cite{Li:2013mia,Catani:2014qha}: steps towards a generalization\nof the ``$q_T$-subtraction'' method to perform a NNLO computation with\ncolored final states have started to be taken~\\cite{Bonciani:2015sha},\nthanks to the availability of these results.\n\n\\subsection{All-order results}\n\\label{sec:resum}\n\\vspace{-0.05cm}\nWhen the $t\\bar{t}$ system is produced just above threshold, effects\ndue to multiple soft-gluon radiation become relevant. In this\nphase-space region large logarithmically-enhanced corrections of the\nform $\\alpha_s^n \\log^m X_s$ appear, where $X_s$ is a kinematic\nfunction that vanishes when the $t\\bar{t}$ system is produced exactly\nat threshold.\nThanks to factorization properties of phase space and production\nmatrix elements in the soft region (the latter being not trivial for\n$t\\bar{t}$ due to color flow), the perturbative expansion can be\nreorganized suitably, by computing systematically the log-enhanced\nterms, and resumming them to all orders.\n\nSeveral groups performed soft-gluon threshold resummation at\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL)\naccuracy~\\cite{Czakon:2009zw,Kidonakis:2010dk,Ahrens:2010zv,Beneke:2011mq,Cacciari:2011hy},\nusing different formalisms, and in one case also resumming Coulomb\neffects~\\cite{Beneke:2011mq}. NNLL resummation has also been matched\nto the exact NNLO computation mentioned in sec.~\\ref{sec:fixed}: this\naccuracy represent the state of the art for $\\sigma_{tot}$, and is\navailable in public codes as {\\ttfamily TOP++}~\\cite{Czakon:2013goa}\nand {\\ttfamily TOPiXS}~\\cite{Beneke:2012wb}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResummed results can also be used to guess the size of the first\nunknown term at fixed order: until the exact NNLO result was\navailable, approximate NNLO results have been computed by several\ngroups.  Nowadays the natural development is to try and compute\n$\\sigma_{tot}$ at approximate N$^3$LO. This has been achieved, using\ndifferent approaches, in ref.~\\cite{Kidonakis:2014isa}, as well as in\nref.~\\cite{Muselli:2015kba} (in the latter paper, high-energy\nresummation was used together with threshold resummation).\n\n\\subsection{Fully differential computations, including top-quark decays}\n\\label{sec:differential}\n\\vspace{-0.05cm}\nSince top quarks can not be detected, $\\sigma_{tot}$ and differential\ndistributions for stable top quarks can not be directly compared with\ndata without some extrapolation. In this respect, differential results\nthat include also the final state decay products are of fundamental\nimportance, and are also a central ingredient for the latest\ndevelopments of modern event generators, to be discussed in\nsec.~\\ref{sec:MC}. The more accurate fixed-order results for\ndescribing the fully exclusive final state arising from ``top pair''\nproduction and decay are those presented, a while ago, in\nrefs.~\\cite{Denner:2012yc,Bevilacqua:2010qb,Heinrich:2013qaa,Frederix:2013gra,Cascioli:2013wga}. Despite\nthere being differences among the computations, all these papers\nessentially contain fully differential NLO results for the\nprocess\\footnote{Throughout the document with this notation it is\n  implied that leptonic $W$ decays are included exactly.}  $pp\\to W^+\nW^- b\\bar{b}$, where all offshellness effects as well as interference\namong double-, singly- and non-resonant diagrams are taken into\naccount exactly up to NLO in QCD. A remarkable result was recently\nobtained in ref.~\\cite{Bevilacqua:2015qha}, where the same effects\nwere also computed at NLO for the process $pp\\to W^+ W^- b\\bar{b} +1$\njet.\n\nIt is worth stressing that two of the aforementioned computations\n(namely~\\cite{Frederix:2013gra} and~\\cite{Cascioli:2013wga}) were\nperformed in the ``4-flavor'' scheme, \\emph{i.e.} the $b$ quarks are\nconsidered massive, hence results are finite also in the limit of\nvanishing $p_T$ for one (or both) $b$ quarks (as well as for\nunresolved $b$-tagged jets). Therefore these computations allow a\nclean comparison among theory predictions (at NLO) and data for the\nexperimental signature traditionally called ``single-top $Wt$''\nproduction: since arbitrary cuts can be safely placed on $b$ jets,\nconsistent results can be obtained for the same final state detected\nexperimentally (2 $b$-tagged jets vs.~\\emph{e.g.} 1 $b$-tag and 1\n$b$-veto), thereby avoiding the ambiguities intrinsically present when\na separation between top-pair and $Wt$ production is attempted\ntheoretically. An experimental analysis dedicated to a comparison\namong these computations and data would certainly be very valuable.\n\n\\section{Recent improvements in event generators}\n\\label{sec:MC}\n\\vspace{-0.05cm} Fully exclusive Monte Carlo event generators based on\nparton-shower algorithms are used ubiquitously in experimental\nsearches, hence their importance for LHC phenomenology doesn't need to\nbe stressed in this short review. A substantial step to improve the\naccuracy of these simulation tools has been made more than a decade\nago, when methods to consistently match NLO QCD computations with\nparton showers algorithms were devised (NLO+PS). Since then, an\nenormous progress took place in this field: all important processes of\nthe type $pp\\to t\\bar{t} +X$ can be simulated at NLO+PS, thanks to the\ndevelopments of fully- or partially-automated\nframeworks~\\cite{Alioli:2010xd,Alwall:2014hca,Hoeche:2011fd,Platzer:2011bc,Kardos:2011qa}. Among\nthem, {\\ttfamily MadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO}~\\cite{Alwall:2014hca} deserves to\nbe specially mentioned, being it the only one which is currently fully\nautomated in the strictest sense, to the point that essentially ``any\nprocess of interest'' can be simulated at NLO+PS accuracy by a generic\nuser, provided that enough computing power is available.\n\nThere are currently two very active research topics in the\ncommunity of Monte Carlo developers that are relevant for top pair\nproduction at hadron colliders: the consistent inclusion of\noffshellness effects in presence of intermediate resonances decaying\ninto colored particles, and the merging of NLO+PS simulations for\ndifferent jet multiplicities. I will review them in turn, with\nparticular emphasis on the former.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation of $pp\\to W^+W^-b\\bar{b}$ at NLO+PS accuracy}\n\\vspace{-0.05cm}\nBefore turning to the explanation of the theoretical issues presently\naddressed by the community, I want to recall that a major application\nwhere a NLO+PS simulation of of $pp\\to W^+W^-b\\bar{b}$ can have an\nimpact is in the determination of the top mass, at least for the\ntechniques where the kinematics of visible particles from top-decay is\nused for this purpose (see~\\cite{Corcella:2015kth} for a recent\nreview).\n\nThe problem with the simulation of $W^+W^-b\\bar{b}$ production can be\nstated as follows: unless special care is taken, when NLO correction\nto the decay are included in NLO+PS tools, the intermediate top-quark\nvirtuality is not preserved. If this happens, non-physical distortion\ncan potentially show up in kinematic distributions.\n\nAlthough there are issues also with the {\\ttfamily MC@NLO} method (see\nfor instance~\\cite{streview}), from this point onward I'll focus on\nthe {\\ttfamily POWHEG} approach.\n\nBefore entering into details, a remark is due: it is\nlegitimate to ask whether the\nissues discussed below are really relevant for practical purposes,\nespecially because NLO+PS results for the $W^+W^-b\\bar{b}$ final state\n(with offshellness and interference effects) were obtained with\n{\\ttfamily PowHel} in ref.~\\cite{Garzelli:2014dka}, and no particular\nproblems were noticed by the authors. The definitive answer can only\nbe given by developing more refined tools and performing careful\ncomparisons among them and against older approaches.\n\nThe {\\ttfamily POWHEG} ``master formula'' to generate a resolved\nemission reads\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\nonumber\n  d\\sigma = d{\\Phi_B} d{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}} \\bar{B}({\\Phi_B}) \\frac{R({\\Phi_B},{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})}{B({\\Phi_B})}\\exp{\\left[-\\int \\frac{R({\\Phi_B},{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})}{B({\\Phi_B})}d{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}}\\right]}\\,.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"d\\sigma=d{\\Phi_{B}}d{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}}\\bar{B}({\\Phi_{B}})\\frac{R({\\Phi_{B}},{%&#10;\\Phi_{\\rm rad}})}{B({\\Phi_{B}})}\\exp{\\left[-\\int\\frac{R({\\Phi_{B}},{\\Phi_{\\rm&#10;rad%&#10;}})}{B({\\Phi_{B}})}d{\\Phi_{\\rm rad}}\\right]}\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>rad</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>rad</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>rad</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mi>rad</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
