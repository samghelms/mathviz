We denote the vertex set and the edge set of $G$, by $V(G)$ and $E(G)$, respectively. For $v\\in V(G)$, $E_v$ denotes the set of\n all edges incident to $v$. A {\\it  $k$-vertex coloring} of $G$ is an assignment of $k$ colors to the vertices of $G$. This coloring is said to be {\\it proper} if no two adjacent vertices have the same color. In this paper, we only consider proper vertex colorings; thus, whenever we say \"vertex coloring\" we mean a proper vertex coloring even if it is not stated explicitly. A $k$-vertex coloring of a  graph $G$ is a partition $(V_1, \\ldots, V_k)$ of $V(G)$ into $k$ independent  sets called {\\it color classes}.  The {\\it chromatic number} $\\chi(G) $ of $G$ is the minimum $k$ for which $G$ is $k$-vertex colorable.  A {\\it $k$-edge coloring} of $G$ is an assignment of $k$ colors to the edges of $G$; it is said to be {\\it proper} if two edges with a common end-point do not have the same color, and {\\it improper} if it is not necessarily proper. The minimum $k$ such that $G$ admits a proper $k$-edge coloring is the {\\it chromatic index} of $G$ and denoted by $\\chi'(G)$. A {\\it $k$-clique} is a set of $k$ vertices inducing a complete graph. A {\\it walk} in $G$ is a  sequence $W=v_0e_1v_1e_2v_2 \\ldots, e_kv_k$, whose terms are alternately vertices and edges, such that $e_i=v_{i-1}v_i$, for $1\\leq i \\leq k$. The number $k$ is called the length of the walk. A walk is called a {\\it closed walk} if $v_0=v_k$.\nWe denote the path and the cycle of order $n$ by $P_n$ and $C_n$, respectively. Also, by $K_n$, we mean the complete graph of order $n$. The reader is referred to~\\cite{golumbic} for all definitions in graph theory which are not defined here.\n\n\n Let $G$ be a graph whose each component has order at least 3. Also let  $s : E(G) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_k$ for some integer $k\\geq 2$ be a proper edge coloring of $G$.

Set $c(x)=0$ for all $x \\in N(v)$ and set the colors of the vertices in each level of the tree rooted at $v$ alternatively by 1 and 0. Now, starting from the deepest level, color the edges of $T$ by 0 and 1 to ensure the colors set for vertices; note that this is always possible by choosing the colors appropriately. Let $a,b,c, \\ldots$ be the colors (among $0,1$ and $2$) of the edges $e_1, e_2,e_3, \\ldots$ incident to $v$.

Now,  $c(x_1)=c(x_2)=2$ and $c(v)=1$ and this is an improper twin $3$-edge coloring of $T$, where one part of the bipartition is colored by 1 and the other part by 0 except two vertices, namely $x_1$ and $x_2$ which are colored by 2.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{thm:bip3}\nLet $B=(X,Y,E)$ be a bipartite graph, then $\\chi'_{it}(B)\\leq 3$.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe first note that it suffices to prove the statement for connected graphs.

In particular, Theorem \\ref{thm:odd} of this section is the generalization of Theorems \\ref{thm:bip2} and  \\ref{thm:bip3} to general graphs. Indeed, for a connected bipartite graph $B=(X,Y,E)$, we have $\\chi(B)=2 \\pmod 4$ and Theorems \\ref{thm:bip2} and  \\ref{thm:bip3} imply that we have $\\chi'_{it}(B)=\\chi(B)+1$ if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ have odd cardinalities; this is exactly Theorem \\ref{thm:odd} (ii) for bipartite graphs. However, it should be noted that although the use of a spanning tree to set the colors of each vertex is the same as in the bipartite case, the technique of closed odd walk used in the general case requires that the graph is not bipartite. Therefore, the bipartite case in Section \\ref{sec:specialcases} is not directly implied by our general result and requires a separate proof.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{oddc} If $G$ is a graph with an odd vertex chromatic number more than $1$, then $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)$.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nWe assume without loss of generality that $G$ is connected since otherwise the same proof applies to every connected component. Let $f$ be a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$ where $k=\\chi(G)$. We show that there is an improper twin edge coloring $s$ of $G$ using exactly $k$ colors, where $c(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i=1,\\ldots, n$. Without loss of generality assume that $v_1$ is a vertex of $G$ such that $f(v_1)=0$ and  $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$ with root $v_1$. Now, color the edges of $T$ from deepest level to the first level so that the vertex coloring induced by this edge coloring ensures  $c(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i\\geq 2$; note that this is always possible since we are proceeding the edges from the last level to the first. Then, color all edges in $E(G)\\setminus E(T)$ by 0. Now, let $a,b,c, \\ldots$ be the colors (among $[0,k-1]$) of the edges in $E(T)$ incident to $v_1$. Then we have $c(v_1)= a+b+c+ \\cdots \\pmod k$. If $c(v_1) = 0 \\pmod k$, then this is an improper twin $k$-edge coloring of $G$. Otherwise, we apply the following technique to obtain a new  improper twin $k$-edge coloring $s'$ inducing a $k$-vertex coloring $c'$,  where $c'(v_i)=c(v_i), i=2,\\ldots, n$ and $c'(v_1)=0$.\n\nWe claim that there exists a closed walk of odd length passing by $v_1$. Since $\\chi(G)>2$, the graph $G$ contains an odd cycle. Consider an odd cycle $C$ in $G$. Since $G$ is connected, there exists a path between $v_1$ and $C$, say $P$. Traverse $P$ starting at $v_1$ and go to $C$ and then traverse $C$ and then come back to $v_1$ via $P$, to obtain an odd closed walk passing by $v_1$. Note that each edge of $P$ is traversed twice. The claim is proved.\n\n Now, add alternately $+x, -x \\pmod k$ to $s(e)$,  for each $e$ in this odd walk starting from $v_1$. All vertices except $v_1$ have $c'(v_i)=c(v_i)$ since the summation of the colors of edges incident to $v_i$ is the same for all $i=2,\\ldots, n $, and $c'(v_1)= 2x + c(v_1) \\pmod k$. Since $k$ is odd, the equation $2x + c(v_1)=0 \\pmod k$ has a solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_k$. The proof is complete.\n \\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{equal}\nLet $G$ be a graph with an even vertex chromatic number more than $2$. Then $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)$ if and only if there exists a $\\chi(G)$-vertex coloring $f:V(G) \\rightarrow \\{0, \\ldots, \\chi(G)-1\\}$ such that $\\sum_{v\\in V(G)}f(v)$ is even.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n$(\\Leftarrow)$  As in the previous theorem, we assume without loss of generality that $G$ is connected. Let $f$ be a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$ such that $\\sum_{i}^{n}f(v_i)$ is even, and $\\chi(G)=k$, where $n=|V(G)|$. Using exactly the same technique as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{oddc}, we show that there is an improper twin edge coloring $s$ of $G$ inducing either a vertex coloring $c$ such that  $c(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i=1,\\ldots, n$ (which concludes the proof), or a vertex coloring $c'$ such that  $c'(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i=2,\\ldots, n$, and $c'(v_1)=2x +c(v_1) \\pmod k$ (where $v_1$ is a vertex such that $f(v_1)=0$ and $c(v_1)$ is defined as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{oddc}).

We restrict ourselves to the class of instances for which a clique of size $\\chi(G)$ as well as a $\\chi(G)$-coloring are given, which allows as to guarantee the polynomial recognition of an instance, a usual assumption in the area of NP-hardness results. More formally we consider the following problem:\\\\\n\n {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} \\\\\nInput: A graph $G$ with a clique of size $k$ and a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$.\\\\\nQuestion: Is $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)$?\\\\\n\nFirst, we notice that from the definition of {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring}, an instance $G$ has $\\chi(G)=k$ and this is equal to the size of a largest clique of $G$. This problem is clearly in NP since, given a ``yes\" answer with an improper twin  $\\chi(G)$-edge coloring of $G$, it takes linear time to check whether the $\\chi(G)$-vertex coloring induced by this improper edge coloring is proper. In addition, we will show in the sequel that the following problem, called {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} is coNP-complete. This implies by Corollary \\ref{cor:final} that {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} is NP-complete for $k=2\\pmod 4$; indeed these are complementary problems in the sense that the answer is ``yes\" for one of them if and only if the answer is ``no\" for the other.\\\\\n\n {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings}\\\\\nInput: A graph $G$ with a clique of size $k$ and a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$.\\\\\nQuestion: Are all color classes of odd size in all $\\chi(G)$-vertex colorings of $G$?\\\\\n\nWe  need the following result for our reduction:\n\\begin{lem}\\label{lem:gadget}\nLet $\\mathcal J$ be the graph in Figure \\ref{fig:gadget} (a) and consider a 3-vertex coloring of $\\mathcal J$ with colors F, T and R where vertices $x,y,z$ and $X$ are colored either $T$ or $F$. Then the following hold:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[(i)] In any such 3-vertex coloring of $\\mathcal J$, where $X$ is colored $T$, at least one among $x,y,z$ should be colored $T$ and among $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_5$, there are $1T, 2F$ and $2R$ colors.\n\\item[(ii)] Similarly, in any such 3-vertex coloring of $\\mathcal J$, where $X$ is colored $F$, at least one among $x,y,z$ should be colored $F$ and among $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_5$, there are $1F, 2T$ and $2R$ colors.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{lem}\n\\begin{proof}\nWe only prove statement (i) since (ii) is obtained similarly. Let $f$ be a $3$-vertex coloring of $\\mathcal J$, where $f(X)=T$ and each one of  $f(x),f(y),f(z)$ is in $\\{T,F\\}$. Then at least one of $x,y,z$ has color $T$, since otherwise (that is if all of $x,y,z$ are colored $F$) we necessarily have $f(a_3)=F$, implying $c(a_4)=R$. Now, $a_5$ has all three colors in its neighbourhood, hence it is impossible to color $a_5$ with one of the three colors $T, F$ and $R$. Besides, $f(X)=T$ implies that we have either $c(a_5)=F, c(a_4)=R$ or $c(a_5)=R, c(a_4)=F$. In either case, among $a_1, a_2, a_3$ there are exactly one $T$, one $F$ and one $R$. Therefore, there are in total exactly $1T, 2F$ and $2R$ colors among $a_1,a_2, \\ldots, a_5$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=11cm]{clausegadget.pdf}\n\\vspace{-3,5cm}\n\\caption{The Clause Gadget $\\mathcal J$ and the instance $G$.}\\label{fig:gadget}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{coNP}\n For all $k\\geq 3$, {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} is coNP-complete.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nFirst,  {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} is in coNP, since one can verify the correctness of a ``no\" certificate in linear time; in other words, given a $k$-vertex coloring with at least one color class of even size, one can check whether it is a vertex coloring using at most $k$ colors and whether it contains a color class with even number of vertices. In the sequel, we show that 3-SAT can be polynomially reduced to the complement of {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} with $k=\\chi(G)=3$.\n\nLet $I$ be an instance of 3-SAT with $n$ variables and $m$ clauses. We assume without loss of generality that $n$ is even (if not, add a variable that appears in no clause). Consider a truth assignment (for instance where all variables are true) and let $m_T$ and $m_F$ be respectively the numbers of true and false clauses. Denote also by $M_T$ and $M_F$ the corresponding sets of clauses, respectively.  Assume without loss of generality that both  $m_T$ and $m_F$ are even (otherwise just double each clause in $I$). We construct an instance $G$ of the complement of  {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} with $k=\\chi(G)=3$ as follows (see Figure \\ref{fig:gadget} (b)). For every variable, consider an edge between vertices $x_i$ and $\\bar x_i$ representing the variable and its negation. Introduce two vertices $X_T$ and $X_F$ representing respectively clauses in $M_T$ and clauses in $M_F$. For every clause, consider a clause gadget $\\mathcal J$ as in Figure \\ref{fig:gadget} (a), whose $x,y,z$ vertices are identified with the variable vertices representing the tree literals (variables or their negations) in the related clause, and whose $X$ vertex is identified with $X_T$ if it is a clause in $M_T$ and with $X_F$ otherwise. Finally, add a vertex $R$ adjacent to all variable vertices and to $X_T$ and $X_F$. Clearly, this instance $G$ can be constructed in polynomial time in the size of the 3-SAT instance $I$. Moreover, it is $3$-vertex colorable; color vertex $R$ by color $R$, $X_T$ by $T$ and $X_F$ by $F$, color also all true literals by $T$ and all false literals by $F$. Now, one can check that this 3-vertex coloring can be extended to the clause gadgets corresponding to clauses in $M_T$ for all possible cases with 1, 2 or 3 true literals per clause. Similarly, it can be extended to the clause gadgets corresponding to clauses in $M_F$ and thus having all variable vertices colored $F$. Indeed, the only 3-vertex coloring of the three literals and $X_T$ (or $X_F$) with colors $T$ and $F$ which can not be extended to a 3-vertex coloring of the clause gadget is when the three literals are all assigned the color $F$ and $X_T$ is assigned $T$, or when the three literals are all assigned the color $T$ and $X_F$ assigned $F$; clearly, this never occurs in the 3-vertex coloring that we defined.\n\n\\begin{claim}\nLet $I$ be a 3-SAT instance and $G$ a graph constructed as described above. Then, $I$ is satisfiable if and only if $G$ has a 3-vertex coloring with $X_T,X_F$ and variable vertices colored with $T$ or $F$, where at least one color class has even size.\n\\end{claim}\n\\begin{proof}\nConsider a truth assignment satisfying all clauses of $I$. Then $G$ can be 3-colored with $T, F$ and $R$ as follows. Color $X_T, X_F$  and all vertices representing true literals by $T$. Color the vertex $R$ by color $R$. Now, one can check that for all possible cases with 1, 2 or 3 true literals per clause,  this coloring can be extended to a 3-vertex coloring of $G$. Moreover, by Lemma~\\ref{lem:gadget} and by the fact that in any such 3-vertex coloring of $G$ there are exactly $n$ variable vertices assigned color $T$, in this 3-vertex coloring there are in total $n+m+2$ vertices colored by $T$, which is an even number (remind that $n, m_T$ and $m_F$ are even and $m=m_T+m_F$).\n\nNow, consider a 3-vertex coloring $f$ of $G$ with $X_T, X_F$ and all variable vertices are colored with $T$ or $F$, where there is at least one color class of even size.   \nNote that in any such 3-vertex coloring of $G$, there are $n$ variable vertices of color $T$ and $n$ variable vertices of color $F$. If $X_T$ and $X_F$ are colored with different colors, say by $T$ and $F$, respectively, then the numbers of occurrences of $T, F$ and $R$ are, respectively $n+m_T+2m_F+1, n+m_F+2m_T+1$ and $2m+1$, where $m=m_T+m_F$. The other case, where $f(X_T)=F$ and $f(X_F)=T$ yields the following numbers of occurrences for $T, F$ and $R$, respectively: $n+m_F+2m_T+1, n+m_T+2m_F+1$ and $2m+1$. It can be seen that all these numbers are odd, a contradiction.  Therefore $f(X_T)=f(X_F)$, and, using Lemma~\\ref{lem:gadget}, a truth assignment satisfying all clauses can be obtained by giving the value true to the literals having the same color as $X_T$ and $X_F$. \n\\end{proof}\n\nSince 3-SAT is NP-complete~\\cite{gj}, deciding whether a given graph with a clique of size 3 and a 3-vertex coloring admits an optimal vertex coloring (with 3 colors) with at least one color class of even size is NP-complete. It follows that  {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} is coNP-complete for $\\chi(G)=k=3$. The coNP-completeness of  {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} for $\\chi(G)=k\\geq 3$ is obtained simply by adding a clique of size $k-3$ completely linked to the graph $G$ in the above reduction; clearly, the $k-3$ vertices of this clique should receive colors other than $T, F$ and $R$ and thus will not affect the above facts.\n\\end{proof}\n\nLet $G$ be an instance of {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} such that $k = 2 \\pmod 4$ (which can be checked in constant time). Now, it follows from Corollary \\ref{cor:final} that the answer to  {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} for $G$ is ``yes\" if and only if the answer to {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} is ``no\". In addition, we have already noticed that {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} is in NP. Therefore {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} and {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} are complementary problems and Theorem~\\ref{coNP} and Corollary~\\ref{cor:final} imply the following:\n\n\\begin{cor}\nFor all $k\\geq 6$, $k = 2 \\pmod 4$, {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} is NP-complete. It is polynomial for all other values of $k$.\n\\end{cor}\n\n\nThe proof of Theorem~\\ref{coNP} opens some natural questions about restricted hard and polynomial cases. We give first results in this direction that underline some open questions for future research. The first natural particular case is the class of graphs of bounded degree. The next proposition shows that, for any fixed $k\\geq 3$, {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} is still hard in these graphs and consequently so does {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} if $k\\geq 6$, $k = 2 \\pmod 4$.  \n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{prop:bounded_degree}\n\t\n\t\nFor all $k\\geq 3$, {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} is coNP-complete in graphs of maximum degree $k+\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{k-2}\\hspace{1pt}\\right\\rceil$.\\\\\nFor $k\\geq 6$, $k = 2 \\pmod 4$ {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $k$-Coloring} is NP-complete in graphs of maximum degree $k+\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{k-2}\\hspace{1pt}\\right\\rceil$.\t\n\\end{prop}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\nFor the sake of simplicity we denote $g(k)=k+\\left\\lceil\\sqrt{k-2}\\hspace{1pt}\\right\\rceil$.\n\nWe show that for $k\\geq 3$, {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} polynomially reduces to the same problem in graphs of maximum degree at most $g(k)$. \nConsider a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\\Delta$ as an instance of {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} for some $k\\geq 3$. If $\\Delta > g(k)$, then we use the following gadget  to construct a graph $G'$ where the number of vertices of degree~$\\Delta$ is one less (eventually 0) than in $G$ and there is no vertex of larger degree, such that $G$ is a $yes$-instance for {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} if and only if $G'$ is. \n\n\n Let $\\ell = 1+ \\left\\lceil\\sqrt{k-2}\\hspace{1pt}\\right\\rceil$. Let $p=2\\left\\lceil \\frac{\\Delta}{2\\ell}\\hspace{1pt}\\right\\rceil+2$. So, $p$ is even and $\\ell(p-1)\\geq \\Delta+1$.\n$H(p,\\ell)$ is defined as follows:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Consider $p$ independent copies of $(k-1)$-cliques $K_1, \\ldots, K_p$.\n\\item \\label{enum:s}Add an independent set $S$ of size $s\\geq \\Delta$ such that $s$ is odd and $\\ell(p-1)-1\\leq s\\leq \\ell(p-1)$. $S=\\{x_{ij}, i=1, \\ldots, p-1, j=1, \\ldots, \\ell\\}$ if $\\ell(p-1)=1  \\pmod 2$ and $S=\\{x_{ij}, i=1, \\ldots, p-1, j=1, \\ldots, \\ell\\}\\setminus \\{x_{p-1,\\ell}\\}$ if $\\ell(p-1)=0  \\pmod 2$. \n\\item For $i=1, \\ldots, p-1$, link by an edge every vertex of $K_i$ with vertices $x_{ij}, j\\leq \\ell$.\n\\item For $i=1, \\ldots, p-1$, partition $K_{i+1}$ into $\\ell$ parts of size at most $\\left\\lceil \\frac{k-1}{\\ell}\\right\\rceil$ and link by an edge vertex $x_{ij}$ with all vertices of part $j$, $j=1, \\ldots, \\ell$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nWithin this construction it is straightforward to verify that in any $k$-vertex coloring of $H(p,\\ell)$, all vertices of $S$ are of the same color and each of the other colors is used exactly once in each clique $K_i, i=1, \\ldots, p$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Fig-bound1.pdf}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Fig-bound2.pdf}\n\n\\caption{The Gadget $H(4,3)$ and how it replaces a vertex $x$ of degree 6. $k=4, \\ell=3, p=4$.}\\label{fig:bound}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n \n\nGiven the graph $G$ of maximum degree $\\Delta$, if $\\Delta > g(k)$, we consider a vertex $x$ of degree $\\Delta$ and number its neighbors $y_1, \\ldots, y_\\Delta$. Then we transform $G$ as follows. We first remove $x$ as well as all its adjacent edges; then we add a copy of $H(p,\\ell)$ and link by an edge $y_t$ with  $x_{\\lceil \\frac{t}{\\ell}\\rceil ,t-\\ell(\\lceil \\frac{t}{\\ell}\\rceil -1)}$, $t=1, \\ldots, \\Delta$, so as to create a matching $M$ of size $\\Delta$ between $S$ and the neighborhood of $x$. We denote by $G'$ the resulting graph (see Figure~\\ref{fig:bound}). We evaluate the degree of vertices of $H(p,\\ell)$ in the graph $G'$: vertices of the cliques $K_i$, $i=1, \\ldots, p$ are of degree at most $k-2+\\ell+1=g(k)$ and vertices of $S$ are (taking into account one possible edge of $M$) of degree at most  $k-1+\\left\\lceil \\frac{k-1}{\\ell}\\right\\rceil+1\\leq k+\\left\\lceil \\frac{k-2+1}{\\lceil\\sqrt{k-2}\\rceil+1}\\right\\rceil \\leq g(k)$. Since $g(k)<\\Delta$, $G'$ has one less vertex of degree $\\Delta $. \n\nUsing the property of $k$-vertex colorings of $H(p,\\ell)$, every $k$-vertex coloring of $G$ with $x$ of color $a$ can be transformed into a $k$-vertex coloring of $G'$ with $S$ colored $a$ and moreover, the number of vertices colored $a$ is increased by $s-1$ and the number of vertices in all other colors is increased by $p$. Conversely every $k$-vertex coloring of $G'$ with $S$ colored $a$ can be transformed into a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$ with $s-1$ vertices less colored $a$ and all other color classes have $p$ less vertices. Since $p$ and $s-1$ are both even, $G$ is a $yes$-instance for {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} if and only if $G'$ is. \n\nThe construction from $G$ to $G'$ can be performed in polynomial time and by repeating it while there are still vertices of degree greater than $g(k)$ we show that {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} polynomially reduces to the same problem in graphs of maximum degree $g(k)$. Corollary~\\ref{cor:final} allows to conclude the proof.\n\\end{proof}\n\nNote that the result of Proposition~\\ref{prop:bounded_degree} for $k=3$ could be obtained by using the gadgets $H_d$, $d\\geq 3$, used in~\\cite{gj}, page~86; however this gadget cannot be (easily) generalised for larger $k$. \n\nIn particular, Proposition~\\ref{prop:bounded_degree} for $k=3$ and for $k=6$ respectively implies that {\\sc All Odd Optimal $3$-Vertex Colorings} is still coNP-complete in graphs of maximum degree~4 and {\\sc Improper Twin Edge $6$-Coloring} is NP-complete in  graphs of maximum degree~8. It leaves open the cases with lower degrees. \n\nIn the rest of this section we exhibit few other graph classes for which the problems under consideration are polynomial.\nWe will say that a vertex coloring is {\\em  complete} if all colors are maximal independent sets. Equivalently, it means that all colors appear in the closed neighborhood of every vertex.\n\n\n \\begin{rmk}\\label{rem:maximal}\\mbox{}\\\\\n\t(1) If for a  graph $G$ all color classes have an odd size in all $\\chi(G)$-vertex colorings, then all $\\chi(G)$-vertex colorings of $G$ are complete;\\\\\n\t(2)  All $\\chi(G)$-vertex colorings of $G$ are complete if and only if for all connected component $H$ of $G$,  all $\\chi(G)$-vertex colorings of $H$ are complete (in particular $\\chi(H)=\\chi(G)$).\\\\\n\t(3) If all $\\chi(G)$-vertex colorings of $G$ are complete, then every vertex is of degree at least $\\chi(G)-1$.  \n\\end{rmk}\n\\begin{proof}\n(1) If a graph $G$ has a $\\chi(G)$-coloring such that one color class is not a maximal independent set, then if all colors are of odd size, it is possible to transfer one vertex from one color to a non-maximal color class so as to create two color classes of even size.\n\n(2)  It is clear that if one component $H$ has an incomplete $\\chi(G)$-vertex coloring (in particular if $\\chi(H)<\\chi(G)$), then $G$ has an incomplete $\\chi(G)$-coloring.\n\n(3) If $G$ has a complete vertex coloring, then the closed neighbourhood of every vertex has at least $k$ vertices of different colors.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nThe first polynomial case below, compared to   Proposition~\\ref{prop:bounded_degree}, emphasizes that, for bounded degree graphs, there is still a gap of value $O(\\sqrt{\\chi(G)})$ for the maximum degree  between hard cases and polynomial cases.\n\n\n\\begin{rmk}\n{\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} is polynomial in graphs of maximum degree $k-1$.\tThe graph is a $yes$-instance if and only if it is the disjoint union of an odd number of $k$-cliques.\n\\end{rmk}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\n\t\n\t Consider a graph $G$ of maximum degree $k-1$, with $k=\\chi(G)$. We distinguish three kinds of connected components of $G$: $k$-cliques (we denote by $p$ their number), odd cycles of length at least 5 (we denote by $q$ their number) and other components (we denote by $r$ their number). \n\t\n\tUsing Brook's theorem~\\cite{brook}, all components that are neither a $k$-clique nor an odd cycle of length at least~5 are $(k-1)$-vertex colorable. So, if $r>0$, Remark~\\ref{rem:maximal} allows to conclude that $G$ has a $\\chi(G)$-coloring with at least one color class of even size.   Odd cycles of size at least~5 are either $(k-1)$-vertex colorable as well if $k\\geq 4$ or have a $k$-vertex coloring which is incomplete if $k=3$ (one can ensure that one color is of size~1). In both cases, if $q>0$, Remark~\\ref{rem:maximal} also ensures that $G$ has a $\\chi(G)$-coloring with at least one color of even size.  \n\tThe only case where all color classes are of odd size in all $k$-vertex colorings is if $r+q=0$ and $p$ is odd.\n\t \\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe recall that a graph is a {\\em split graph} if its vertex set can be decomposed into a clique and an independent set. Also, a graph $G$ is called {\\em perfect} if every induced subgraph $G'$ of $G$ has a (maximum) clique of size~$\\chi(G')$. It is well known (see e.g.~\\cite{golumbic}) that a split graph $G$ can be decomposed into a maximum clique $K$  and an independent set $S$. Since split graphs are perfect, we have $|K|=\\chi(G)$.\n\n\\begin{prop}\n\tConsider a split graph $G$ decomposed into a maximum clique $K$ of size $k=\\chi(G)$ and an independent set $S$ of size $s$. Then all color classes are of odd size in all $k$-vertex colorings if and only if every vertex in the independent set has degree $(k-1)$ and the degree of every vertex in the clique is of the opposite parity as the number of vertices $(k+s)$.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nNote first that if $S=\\emptyset\t$, then the condition holds and in this case all color classes are singletons. Suppose now $S\\neq\\emptyset\t$.\nUsing Remark~\\ref{rem:maximal}, a necessary condition to have all color classes of odd size in all $k$-vertex colorings is that the degree of every vertex in  $S$ is equal to $k-1$ (it cannot be more since $K$ is a maximum clique). \nThen there is a unique $k$-vertex coloring (up to the permutation of colors); each color class has odd size if and only if every vertex in  $K$ is not adjacent to an even number of vertices in $S$. It follows that for every vertex  $x\\in K$ the number of adjacent vertices  in $S$ is of the same parity as $s$; moreover, $x$ is adjacent to all other $k-1$ vertices in $K$, this is equivalent to the fact that the degree of $x$ is of the opposite parity as the number of vertices $(k+s)$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA class of graphs is called {\\em hereditary} if whenever a graph belongs to the class all its induced subgraphs also belong to it.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{pro:cochordal}\nConsider a hereditary class of graphs $\\mathcal{G}$ for which all maximal independent sets and the chromatic number \n can be computed in polynomial time. Then {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} and {\\sc Minimum Improper Twin Edge Coloring} are polynomial in $\\mathcal{G}$.\n\\end{prop}\n\\begin{proof}\nFor any graph $G\\in \\mathcal{G}$, to decide whether $G$ admits an optimal coloring with at least one color class including an even number of vertices, we proceed in two phases. First enumerate all maximal independent sets with an even number of vertices and test  for each one whether the graph obtained by removing its vertices has chromatic number $\\chi(G)-1$. If it is the case for at least one independent set of even size,\n then this independent set is a color of even size in at least one optimal vertex coloring. \n Else consider all maximal independent sets $S_0$ with odd number of vertices  and for every $x\\in S_0$ remove $S_0\\setminus \\{x\\}$ and test whether the remaining graph has chromatic number $\\chi(G)-1$. If it is the case for some $S_0$, then there is also an optimal coloring with a color class of even size.\n\nSuppose now that the two phases failed to find  a coloring with an even color class. From the first phase, we know that every complete $\\chi(G)$-coloring has all color classes of odd size. Note finally that, if there is an incomplete optimal coloring, then by transferring some vertices from other colors to a non-maximal color class we can construct an optimal coloring where one color is a maximal independent set minus one vertex. This color class cannot be of odd size if the first phase failed.  If the second phase also failed, it cannot be of even size neither, and consequently all  optimal colorings are complete and thus all color classes are of odd size in  all optimal colorings. We conclude by Corollary \\ref{cor:final}. \\end{proof}\n\nA graph is {\\em chordal} (or triangulated) if every cycle of size greater than~3 has a {\\it chord}, that is an edge between two non consecutive vertices in the cycle. A graph is co-chordal if its complementary is chordal.\nIt is known that in chordal graphs all maximal cliques can be computed with complexity $O(|V|+|E|)$~(\\cite{golumbic}). Since co-chordal graphs are perfect, Proposition~\\ref{pro:cochordal} applies.\n\n\\begin{cor}\n{\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} and {\\sc Minimum Improper Twin Edge Coloring} are polynomial in co-chordal graphs.\t\n\\end{cor}\n\n\nWe finally consider the class of co-comparability graphs that includes for instance interval graphs and permutation graphs (see~\\cite{golumbic} for definitions of these classes). A graph is a {\\em comparability} graph if it has a transitive orientation of its edges, that is an orientation of edges such that, for every two adjacent edges  $xy$ and $yz$, if $xy$ is oriented from $x$ to $y$ and $yz$ is oriented from $y$ to $z$, then $xz$ is an edge and it is oriented from $x$ to $z$. A graph is a co-comparability graph if its complement is a comparability graph.  A co-comparability graph $G=(V,E)$ has a {\\em co-comparability order} that is an order of vertices $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ such that $\\forall a<b<c$, if $x_ax_b\\notin E$ and $x_bx_c\\notin E$, then $x_ax_c\\notin E$~\\cite{cocomparability}. \n\nFor any $k$-vertex coloring ($k\\geq \\chi(G)$) we will call the {\\em type} of this coloring the list $[n_1, \\ldots, n_{k}]$ of the sizes of the different colors (we may have $n_a=0$ for some $a$). Of course $\\sum_{a=1}^{k}n_a=|V|$. In order to avoid useless repetitions of types due to the order of colors, we systematically write a type with colors ordered in  non-decreasing order of their size.\n\n\\begin{prop}\\label{pro:cocomp}\n\tLet $G$ be a co-comparability graph of bounded chromatic number, then all possible types of $\\chi(G)$-colorings can be computed in polynomial time.\n\\end{prop}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe consider a co-comparability order $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ and process by dynamic programming. For a vertex $x_a$, $a$ will be called its {\\em rank}. We denote by $x_0$ a fictive vertex considered as isolated. For any $1\\leq \\ell\\leq n$, we denote by $G_\\ell$ the subgraph of $G$ induced by $x_1, \\ldots, x_\\ell$. The number $T$ of  possible types of $\\chi(G)$-vertex colorings of $G_\\ell$ is bounded by $O(\\ell^{\\chi(G)})$, which is  polynomial in $n$ since $\\chi(G)$ is bounded. For any coloring of type $[n_1, \\ldots, n_{\\chi(G)}]$ we denote the colors $c_1, \\ldots, c_{\\chi(G)}$ of size $n_1, \\ldots, n_{\\chi(G)}$, respectively. We define its {\\em state} as the list $[ (n_1,y_1), \\ldots, (n_{\\chi(G)},y_{\\chi(G))})]$, where $y_a$ is the vertex of  maximum rank in color $c_a$ if $n_a\\neq 0$ and $y_a=x_0$ if $n_a=0$.  Denoting by $S_\\ell$ the number of possible states of  $\\chi(G)$-colorings of $G_\\ell$, we have $S_\\ell\\leq  \t(\\ell+1) T$. \n\nNote that, using the key property of the co-comparability order, for any independent set $\\sigma$ of $G_\\ell$, $\\ell < n$, with  $x_a$ ($a\\leq \\ell$) the vertex of maximum rank in $\\sigma$, $x_{\\ell+1}\\cup \\sigma$ is independent if and only if $x_{\\ell+1}$ and $x_a$ are not adjacent. \nThus, from all possible states of  $G_\\ell$ we can compute in polynomial time all possible states in $G_{\\ell+1}$. Starting from the states $[(0,x_0), \\ldots, (0, x_0), (1, x_1)]$ we can compute in polynomial time all states of $\\chi(G)$-colorings of $G$. The set of all possible types can be trivially deduced.\n\\end{proof}\n\nThe list of types allows immediately to detect all odd colorings and yields the following result using Corollary \\ref{cor:final}.\n\n\\begin{cor}\n\t{\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} and {\\sc Minimum Improper Twin Edge Coloring} are polynomial in co-comparability graphs with bounded chromatic number.\n\\end{cor}\n\nThese simple examples of polynomial cases allow us to underline some specific situations leading to a polynomial algorithm. These algorithms are all based on an enumeration of  all possible color sizes. Cliques or connected bipartite graphs are uniquely colorable, which makes {\\sc All Odd Optimal $k$-Vertex Colorings} trivial. The case of split graphs also reduces to the case of a uniquely colorable graph. Proposition~\\ref{pro:cochordal} exhibits a situation where we can exhaustively look for one of the colors while  in the case of Proposition~\\ref{pro:cocomp} the sizes of all color classes can be computed in polynomial time. Remark~\\ref{rem:maximal} gives a completely different approach that does not require the explicit values of the sizes of color classes. It would be very interesting to find other classes where similar approaches can be applied as well as cases inducing completely new methods. \n\nIn terms of graph classes, these examples underline open cases we leave for future research. Let us mention in particular the complexity in perfect graphs and in planar graphs as well as the case of interval graphs or permutation graphs with unbounded chromatic number. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{0.2cm}\n\\bibliographystyle{abbrvwithurl}\n\\bibliography{}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\n\n\n\n\\bibitem{and} E.

Set $c(x)=0$ for all $x \\in N(v)$ and set the colors of the vertices in each level of the tree rooted at $v$ alternatively by 1 and 0. Now, starting from the deepest level, color the edges of $T$ by 0 and 1 to ensure the colors set for vertices; note that this is always possible by choosing the colors appropriately. Let $a,b,c, \\ldots$ be the colors (among $0,1$ and $2$) of the edges $e_1, e_2,e_3, \\ldots$ incident to $v$. If $a+b+c+ \\cdots = 1 \\mbox{ or } 2 \\pmod 3$, then this is an improper twin 3-edge coloring of $T$ where color 2 is used at most once, and therefore statements $(i)$ and $(ii)$ are satisfied.

Now,  $c(x_1)=c(x_2)=2$ and $c(v)=1$ and this is an improper twin $3$-edge coloring of $T$, where one part of the bipartition is colored by 1 and the other part by 0 except two vertices, namely $x_1$ and $x_2$ which are colored by 2.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{thm:bip3}\nLet $B=(X,Y,E)$ be a bipartite graph, then $\\chi'_{it}(B)\\leq 3$.\n\\end{thm}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe first note that it suffices to prove the statement for connected graphs.

Moreover, this can be checked in constant time if $B$ is given with its bipartition $(X,Y)$.\n\\end{cor}\n\nOne can also note that, it follows from Lemma \\ref{thm:tree3} that if $\\chi'_{it}(B) = 3$, then there is an improper twin 3-edge coloring of $B$ such that color 2 appears at most twice in one part and no color 0 (respectively 1) appears in different parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Bounds on the Improper Twin Edge Chromatic Index}\\label{sec:general}\n\nIn this section, we show that $\\chi(G) \\leq \\chi'_{it}(G)\\leq \\chi(G)+1$ holds for general graphs. In particular, Theorem \\ref{thm:odd} of this section is the generalization of Theorems \\ref{thm:bip2} and  \\ref{thm:bip3} to general graphs. Indeed, for a connected bipartite graph $B=(X,Y,E)$, we have $\\chi(B)=2 \\pmod 4$ and Theorems \\ref{thm:bip2} and  \\ref{thm:bip3} imply that we have $\\chi'_{it}(B)=\\chi(B)+1$ if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ have odd cardinalities; this is exactly Theorem \\ref{thm:odd} (ii) for bipartite graphs. However, it should be noted that although the use of a spanning tree to set the colors of each vertex is the same as in the bipartite case, the technique of closed odd walk used in the general case requires that the graph is not bipartite. Therefore, the bipartite case in Section \\ref{sec:specialcases} is not directly implied by our general result and requires a separate proof.\n\n\\begin{thm}\\label{oddc} If $G$ is a graph with an odd vertex chromatic number more than $1$, then $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)$.\n\\end{thm}\n\\begin{proof}\nWe assume without loss of generality that $G$ is connected since otherwise the same proof applies to every connected component. Let $f$ be a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$ where $k=\\chi(G)$. We show that there is an improper twin edge coloring $s$ of $G$ using exactly $k$ colors, where $c(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i=1,\\ldots, n$. Without loss of generality assume that $v_1$ is a vertex of $G$ such that $f(v_1)=0$ and  $T$ is a spanning tree of $G$ with root $v_1$. Now, color the edges of $T$ from deepest level to the first level so that the vertex coloring induced by this edge coloring ensures  $c(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i\\geq 2$; note that this is always possible since we are proceeding the edges from the last level to the first. Then, color all edges in $E(G)\\setminus E(T)$ by 0. Now, let $a,b,c, \\ldots$ be the colors (among $[0,k-1]$) of the edges in $E(T)$ incident to $v_1$. Then we have $c(v_1)= a+b+c+ \\cdots \\pmod k$. If $c(v_1) = 0 \\pmod k$, then this is an improper twin $k$-edge coloring of $G$. Otherwise, we apply the following technique to obtain a new  improper twin $k$-edge coloring $s'$ inducing a $k$-vertex coloring $c'$,  where $c'(v_i)=c(v_i), i=2,\\ldots, n$ and $c'(v_1)=0$.\n\nWe claim that there exists a closed walk of odd length passing by $v_1$. Since $\\chi(G)>2$, the graph $G$ contains an odd cycle. Consider an odd cycle $C$ in $G$. Since $G$ is connected, there exists a path between $v_1$ and $C$, say $P$. Traverse $P$ starting at $v_1$ and go to $C$ and then traverse $C$ and then come back to $v_1$ via $P$, to obtain an odd closed walk passing by $v_1$. Note that each edge of $P$ is traversed twice. The claim is proved.\n\n Now, add alternately $+x, -x \\pmod k$ to $s(e)$,  for each $e$ in this odd walk starting from $v_1$. All vertices except $v_1$ have $c'(v_i)=c(v_i)$ since the summation of the colors of edges incident to $v_i$ is the same for all $i=2,\\ldots, n $, and $c'(v_1)= 2x + c(v_1) \\pmod k$. Since $k$ is odd, the equation $2x + c(v_1)=0 \\pmod k$ has a solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_k$. The proof is complete.\n \\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{lem}\\label{equal}\nLet $G$ be a graph with an even vertex chromatic number more than $2$. Then $\\chi'_{it}(G)=\\chi(G)$ if and only if there exists a $\\chi(G)$-vertex coloring $f:V(G) \\rightarrow \\{0, \\ldots, \\chi(G)-1\\}$ such that $\\sum_{v\\in V(G)}f(v)$ is even.\n\\end{lem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n$(\\Leftarrow)$  As in the previous theorem, we assume without loss of generality that $G$ is connected. Let $f$ be a $k$-vertex coloring of $G$ such that $\\sum_{i}^{n}f(v_i)$ is even, and $\\chi(G)=k$, where $n=|V(G)|$. Using exactly the same technique as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{oddc}, we show that there is an improper twin edge coloring $s$ of $G$ inducing either a vertex coloring $c$ such that  $c(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i=1,\\ldots, n$ (which concludes the proof), or a vertex coloring $c'$ such that  $c'(v_i)=f(v_i)$ for all vertices $v_i \\in V(G), i=2,\\ldots, n$, and $c'(v_1)=2x +c(v_1) \\pmod k$ (where $v_1$ is a vertex such that $f(v_1)=0$ and $c(v_1)$ is defined as in the proof of Theorem \\ref{oddc}).
