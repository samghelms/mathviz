The least such integer is called the \\emph{${\\mathbf{F}}$-periodicity} of $G$.  \nIf $n=1$, $G$ is called \\emph{${\\mathbf{F}}$-stable}.\n\\end{definition}\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section \\ref{prelim} we give some basic results. \nIn later sections, using Zorn's lemma, transfinite induction, the well ordering principle and the theory of cardinal numbers, we study the number of ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots and determine the ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergence, ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergence, ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth and ${\\mathbf{F}}$-stability of any graph $G$. In particular we show that: \ni) A graph $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergent if and only if $G$ has at most one cycle of length 3. \nii) The ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of any graph $G$ different from $K_3$ and $K_1$ is finite. \niii) The ${\\mathbf{F}}$-stable graphs are precisely $K_3$ and $K_1$. \niv) A graph that has one ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root has innumerably many, but only some ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots are important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\\label{prelim}\n\nFor standard notation and terminology in graph theory we follow Diestel \\cite{diestel2005graph} and Prisner \\cite{prisner1995graph}.\n \nSome elementary properties of infinite cardinal numbers that we use are (see, e.g., Kamke \\cite{kamke1950theory}):\n \\begin{enumerate}[\\quad(1)]\n \\item $\\alpha+\\beta = \\alpha.\\beta = \\max(\\alpha,\\beta)$ if $\\alpha, \\beta$ are cardinal numbers and $\\beta$ is infinite.  In particular, $2.\\beta=\\aleph_0.\\beta=\\beta$.\n \\item $\\beta^n = \\beta$ if $\\beta$ is an infinite cardinal and $n$ is a positive integer.\n \\item $\\beta<2^\\beta$ for every cardinal number.\n \\item The number of finite subsets of an infinite set of cardinality $\\beta$ is equal to $\\beta$.\n \\end{enumerate}\n\nWe consider finite and infinite labeled graphs \\emph{without multiple edges or loops}.  An \\emph{isthmus} of a graph $G$ is an edge $e$ such that deleting $e$ divides one component of $G$ into two of $G-e$.  Equivalently, an isthmus is an edge that belongs to no cycle.  Each isthmus is in every maximal forest, but no non-isthmus is.\n\nLet  $\\mathfrak{C}(G)$ and ${\\mathfrak{N}}(G)$ denote the set of all possible cycles and the set of all maximal forests of a graph $G$, respectively.  \n\n\nNote that a maximal forest of $G$ consists of a spanning tree in each component of $G$.  A fundamental fact, whose proof is similar to that of the existence of a maximal forest, is the following forest extension lemma:\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{forest-extension}\nIn any graph $G$, every forest is contained in a maximal forest.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{l2.5}\nIf $G$ is a complete graph of infinite order $\\alpha$, then $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(G)| = 2^{\\alpha}$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G=(V,E)$ be a complete graph of order $\\alpha$ ($\\alpha$ infinite), i.e., $G=K_{\\alpha}$. \nLet $v_1$, $v_2$ be two vertices of $G$ and $V'=V\\setminus\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. Then for every $A\\subseteq V'$ there is a spanning tree $T_A$ such that every vertex of $A$ is adjacent only to $v_1$ and every vertex of $V'\\setminus A$ is adjacent only to $v_2$. \nIt is easy to see that $T_A \\neq T_B$ whenever $A\\neq B$. \nAs the cardinality of the power set of $V'$ is $2^\\alpha$, there are at least $2^\\alpha$ spanning trees of $G$.\nSince $G$ is connected, the maximal forests are the spanning trees; therefore $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(G)| \\geq 2^{\\alpha} $.\nSince the degree of each vertex is $\\alpha$ and $G$ contains $\\alpha$ vertices, the total number of edges in $G$ is $\\alpha.\\alpha = \\alpha$. \nThe edge set of a maximal forest of $G$ is a subset of $E$ and the number of all\npossible subsets of $E$ is $2^{\\alpha}$. Therefore, $G$ has at most\n$2^{\\alpha}$ maximal forests, i.e., $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(G)| \\leq 2^{\\alpha}$. Hence $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(G)| = 2^{\\alpha}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\nFor two maximal forests of $G$, $F_1$ and $F_2$, let $d(F_1,F_2)$ denote the distance between them in ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$.  We connect this distance to the number of edges by which $F_1,F_2$ differ; the result is elementary but we could not find it anywhere in the literature.  We say $F_1, F_2$ \\emph{differ by $l$ edges} if $|E(F_1) \\setminus E(F_2)|=|E(F_2) \\setminus E(F_1)|=l$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{l2.3}\nLet $l$ be a natural number.  For two maximal forests $F_1, F_2$ of a graph $G$, if $|E(F_1) \\setminus E(F_2)|=l$, then $|E(F_2) \\setminus E(F_1)|=l$.  \nFurthermore, $F_1$ and $F_2$ differ by exactly $l$ edges if and only if $d(F_1,F_2)=l$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\nWe cannot apply to an infinite graph the simple proof for finite graphs, in which the number of edges in a maximal forest is given by a formula.  Therefore, we prove the lemma by edge exchange.\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe prove the first part by induction on $l$.  Let $F_1, F_2$ be maximal forests of $G$ and let $E(F_1) \\setminus E(F_2)=\\{e_{1}',e_{2}',\\ldots,e_{k}'\\}$, $E(F_2) \\setminus E(F_1)=\\{e_{1},e_{2},\\ldots,e_{l}\\}$.  If $l=0$ then $k=0=l$ because $F_2 = F_1$.  Suppose $l>0$; then $k>0$ also.  Deleting $e_l$ from $F_2$ divides a tree of $F_2$ into two trees.  Since these trees are in the same component of $G$, there is an edge of $F_1$ that connects them; this edge is not $e_1$ so it is not in $F_2$; therefore, it is an $e_i'$, say $e_k'$.  Let $F_2' = F_2 - e_l + e_k'$.  Then $E(F_1) \\setminus E(F_2')=\\{e_{1}',e_{2}',\\ldots,e_{k-1}'\\}$, $E(F_2) \\setminus E(F_1)=\\{e_{1},e_{2},\\ldots,e_{l-1}\\}$.  By induction, $k-1=l-1$.\n\nWe also prove the second part by induction on $l$.  Assume $F_1,F_2$ differ by exactly $l$ edges and define $F_2'$ as above.  If $l=0,1$, clearly $d(F_1,F_2)=l$.  Suppose $l>1$.  \nIn a shortest path from $F_1$ to $F_2$, whose length is $d(F_1,F_2)$, each successive edge of the path can increase the number of edges not in $F_1$ by at most 1.  Therefore, $F_1$ and $F_2$ differ by at most $d(F_1,F_2)$ edges.  That is, $l\\leq d(F_1,F_2)$.\nConversely, $d(F_1,F_2')=l-1$ by induction and there is a path in ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ from $F_1$ to $F_2'$ of length $l-1$, then continuing to $F_2$ and having total length $l$.  Thus, $d(F_1,F_2)\\leq l$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above lemma we have two corollaries.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{l2.4}\nFor any graph $G$, ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is connected if and only if any two maximal forests of $G$ differ by at most a finite number of edges. \n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{l2.d}\nIf $G=K_\\alpha$, $\\alpha$ infinite, then ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is disconnected.\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{edge-count}\nLet $G$ be a graph with $\\alpha$ vertices and $\\beta$ edges and with no isolated vertices.  If either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ is infinite, then $\\alpha=\\beta$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe know that $|E(G)|\\leq|V(G)|^2$, i.e., $\\beta\\leq\\alpha^2$ so if $\\beta$ is infinite, $\\alpha$ must also be infinite.  We also know, since each edge has two endpoints, that $|V(G)|\\leq2|E(G)|$, i.e., $\\alpha\\leq2.\\beta$ so if $\\alpha$ is infinite, then $\\beta$ must be infinite.  \nNow assuming both are infinite, $\\alpha^2=\\alpha$ and $2.\\beta=\\beta$, hence $\\alpha=\\beta$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following lemmas are needed in connection with ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergence and ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergence in Section \\ref{convergence} and ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth in Section \\ref{depth}.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{l2.1}\nLet $G$ be a graph. If $K_n$ (for finite $n\\geq2$) is a subgraph of $G$, then $K_{\\lfloor{n^2}/{4}\\rfloor}$ is a subgraph of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a graph such that $K_n$ ($n\\geq2$, finite) is a subgraph of $G$ with vertex labels $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$. Then there is a path $L = v_1, v_2, \\ldots ,v_n$ of order $n$ in $G$. Let $F$ be a maximal forest of $G$ such that $F$ contains the path $L$. In $F$ if we replace the edge $v_{\\lfloor{n}/{2}\\rfloor}v_{\\lfloor{n}/{2}\\rfloor+1}$ by any other edge $v_iv_j$ where $i=1,\\ldots,\\lfloor{n}/{2}\\rfloor$ and $j=\\lfloor{n}/{2}\\rfloor+1,\\ldots, n$, we get a maximal forest $F_{ij}$.  Since there are $\\lfloor {n^2}/{4} \\rfloor$ such edges $v_iv_j$, there are $\\lfloor {n^2}/{4} \\rfloor$ maximal forests $F_{ij}$ (of which one is $F$).  Any two forests $F_{ij}$ differ by one edge.  It follows that they form a complete subgraph in ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$. Therefore $K_{\\lfloor{n^2}/{4}\\rfloor}$ is a subgraph of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{cycle-kn}\nIf $G$ has a cycle of (finite) length $n$ with $n\\geq3$, then ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ contains $K_n$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nSuppose that $G$ has a cycle $C_n$ of length $n$ with edge set $\\{e_1,e_2,\\ldots,e_n\\}$. \nLet $P_i=C_n - e_i$ for $i=1,2, \\dots, n$ and let $F_1$ be a maximal forest of $G$ containing the path $P_1$.  Define $F_i=F_1 \\setminus P_1 \\cup P_i$ for $i=2, 3, \\dots, n$.  \nThese $F_i$'s are maximal forests of $G$ and any two of them differ by exactly one edge, so they form a complete graph $K_n$ in ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$.  \n\\end{proof}\n\n\nIn particular, ${\\mathbf{F}}(C_n)=K_n$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{k-cayley}\nSuppose that $G$ contains $K_n$, where $n\\geq3$.  Then ${\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)$ contains $K_{n^{n-2}}$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nCayley's formula states that $K_n$ has $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees.  Cummins \\cite{cummins1966hamilton} proved that the tree graph of a finite connected graph is Hamiltonian.  Therefore, ${\\mathbf{F}}(K_n)$ contains $C_{n^{n-2}}$.  \nLet $F_{T_0}$ be a spanning tree of $G$ that extends one of the spanning trees $T_0$ of the $K_n$ subgraph.  Replacing the edges of $T_0$ in $F_{T_0}$ by the edges of any other spanning tree $T$ of $K_n$, we have a spanning tree $F_T$ that contains $T$.  \nThe $F_T$'s for all spanning trees $T$ of $K_n$ are $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees of $G$ that differ only within $K_n$; thus, the graph of the $F_T$'s is the same as the graph of the $T$'s, which is Hamiltonian.  That is, ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ contains $C_{n^{n-2}}$.  By Lemma \\ref{cycle-kn}, ${\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)$ contains $K_{n^{n-2}}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nWe do not know exactly what graphs ${\\mathbf{F}}(K_n)$ and ${\\mathbf{F}}^2(K_n)$ are.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{triangles-k9}\nIf $G$ has two edge disjoint triangles, then ${\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)$ contains $K_9$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nSuppose that $G$ has two edge disjoint triangles whose edges are $e_1,e_2,e_3$ and $f_1,f_2,f_3$, respectively.  The union of the triangles has exactly 9 maximal forests $F_{ij}'$, obtained by deleting one $e_i$ and one $f_j$ from the triangles.  Extend $F_{11}'$ to a maximal forest $F_{11}$ and let $F_{ij}$ be the maximal forest $F_{11}\\setminus E(F_{11}') \\cup F_{ij}$, for each $i,j=1,2,3$.  The nine maximal forests $F_{ij}'$, and consequently the maximal forests $F_{ij}$ in ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$, form a Cartesian product graph $C_3 \\times C_3$, which contains a cycle of length 9.  By Lemma \\ref{cycle-kn}, ${\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)$ contains $K_9$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\nWe now show that repeated application of the forest graph operator to many graphs creates larger and larger complete subgraphs.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{l2.2}\nIf $G$ has a cycle of (finite) length $n$ with $n\\geq4$ or it has two edge disjoint triangles, then for any finite $m\\geq1$, ${\\mathbf{F}}^{m}(G)$ contains $K_{m^{2}}$.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nWe prove this lemma by induction on $m$. \n\n\\textbf{Case 1:}  Suppose that $G$ has a cycle $C_n$ of length $n$ ($n \\geq 4$, $n$ finite).  \nBy Lemma \\ref{cycle-kn}, ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ contains $K_{n}$ as a subgraph, which implies that ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ contains $K_4$.  \nBy Lemma \\ref{k-cayley}, ${\\mathbf{F}}^3(G)$ contains $K_{16}$ and in particular it contains $K_{3^2}$.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2:}  Suppose that $G$ has two edge disjoint triangles.\nBy Lemma \\ref{triangles-k9} ${\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)$ contains $K_{9}$ as a subgraph.  \nIt follows by Lemma \\ref{l2.1} that ${\\mathbf{F}}^{3}(G)$ contains $K_{\\lfloor{9^2}/{4} \\rfloor}=K_{20}$ as a subgraph. This implies that ${\\mathbf{F}}^{3}(G)$ contains $K_{3^2}$ as a subgraph.\n\nBy Cases 1 and 2 it follows that the result is true for $m = 1, 2, 3$. \nLet us assume that the result is true for $m=l\\geq3$, i.e., that ${\\mathbf{F}}^{l}(G)$ contains $K_{l^{2}}$ as a subgraph.  \nBy Lemma \\ref{l2.1} it follows that ${\\mathbf{F}}({\\mathbf{F}}^{l}(G))$ has a subgraph $K_{\\lfloor{l^4}/{4}\\rfloor}$. Since ${\\lfloor{l^4}/{4}\\rfloor} > (l+1)^2$, it follows that ${\\mathbf{F}}^{l+1}(G)$ contains $K_{(l+1)^2}$. By the induction hypothesis ${\\mathbf{F}}^{m}(G)$ contains $K_{m^{2}}$ for any finite $m\\geq1$.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWith Lemma \\ref{k-cayley} it is clearly possible to prove a much stronger lower bound on complete subgraphs of iterated forest graphs, but Lemma \\ref{l2.2} is good enough for our purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{fg-order}\nA forest graph that is not $K_1$ has no isolated vertices and no isthmi.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G={\\mathbf{F}}(H)$ for some graph $H$.  Consider a vertex $F$ of $G$, that is, a maximal forest in $H$.  \nLet $e$ be an edge of $F$ that belongs to a cycle $C$ in $H$.  \nThen there is an edge $f$ in $C$ that is not in $F$ and $F'=F-e+f$ is a second maximal forest that is adjacent to $F$ in $G$.  Since $C$ has length at least 3, it has a third edge $g$.  If $g$ is not in $F$, let $F''=F-e+g$.  If $g$ is in $F$, let $F''=F-g+f$.  In both cases $F''$ is a maximal forest that is adjacent to $F$ and $F'$.  Thus, $F$ is not isolated and the edge $FF'$ in $G$ is not an isthmus.  \n\nSuppose $F,F'\\in{\\mathfrak{N}}(H)$ are adjacent in $G$.  That means there are edges $e\\in E(F)$ and $e'\\in E(F')$ such that $F'=F-e+e'$.  Thus, $e$ belongs to the unique cycle in $F+e'$.  As shown above, there is an $F''\\in{\\mathfrak{N}}(H)$ that forms a cycle with $F$ and $F'$.  Therefore the edge $FF'$ of $G$ is not an isthmus.\n\nLet $F\\in{\\mathfrak{N}}(H)$ be an isolated vertex in $G$.  If $H$ has an edge $e$ not in $F$, then $F+e$ contains a cycle so $F$ has a neighboring vertex in $G$, as shown above.  Therefore, no such $e$ can exist; in other words, $H=F$ and $G$ is $K_1$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Basic Properties of an Infinite Forest Graph}\\label{properties}\n\nWe now present a crucial foundation for the proof of the main theorem in Section \\ref{convergence}.  The \\emph{cyclomatic number} $\\beta_1(G)$ of a graph $G$ can be defined as the cardinality $|E(G)\\setminus E(F)|$ where $F$ is a maximal forest of $G$.\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{2.8}\nLet $G$ be a graph such that $|\\mathfrak{C}(G)| = \\beta$, an infinite cardinal number.  Then:\n \\begin{description}\n  \\item[i)] $\\beta_1(G) = \\beta$ and $\\beta_1({\\mathbf{F}}(G))=2^\\beta$.  \n  \n  \\item[ii)] Both the order of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ and its number of edges equal $2^{\\beta}$.  Both the order and the number of edges of $G$ equal $\\beta$, provided that $G$ has no isolated vertices and no isthmi.\n  \\item[iii)] ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $\\beta$-regular.  \n  \\item[iv)] The order of any connected component of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $\\beta$, and it has exactly $\\beta$ edges.  \n  \\item[v)]  ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has exactly $2^{\\beta}$ components.  \n  \\item[vi)] Every component of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has exactly $\\beta$ cycles.  \n  \\item[vii)] $|\\mathfrak{C}({\\mathbf{F}}(G))| = 2^{\\beta}$.  \n \\end{description}\n\\end{proposition}\n\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a graph with $|\\mathfrak{C}(G)|$ = $\\beta$ ($\\beta$ infinite).  \n\ni)  Let $F$ be a maximal forest of $G$.  The number of cycles in $G$ is not more than the number of finite subsets of $E(G)\\setminus E(F)$.  This number is finite if $E(G)\\setminus E(F)$ is finite, but it cannot be finite because $|\\mathfrak{C}(G)|$ is infinite.  \nTherefore $E(G)\\setminus E(F)$ is infinite and the number of its finite subsets equals $|E(G)\\setminus E(F)|=\\beta_1(G)$.  Thus, $\\beta_1(G) \\geq |\\mathfrak{C}(G)|$.  \nThe number of cycles is at least as large as the number of edges not in $F$, because every such edge makes a different cycle with $F$.  Thus, $|\\mathfrak{C}(G)| \\geq \\beta_1(G)$.  \nIt follows that $\\beta_1(G) = |\\mathfrak{C}(G)| = \\beta$.  Note that this proves $\\beta_1(G)$ does not depend on the choice of $F$.\n\nThe value of $\\beta_1({\\mathbf{F}}(G))$ follows from this and part (vii).\n\n\nii) For the first part, let $F$ be a maximal forest of $G$ and let $F_0$ be a maximal forest of $G\\setminus E(F)$.  \nAs $G\\setminus E(F)$ has $\\beta_1(G)=\\beta$ edges by part (i), it has $\\beta$ non-isolated vertices by Lemma \\ref{edge-count}.  $F_0$ has the same non-isolated vertices, so it too has $\\beta$ edges.\n\nAny edge set $A \\subseteq F_0$ extends to a maximal forest $F_A$ in $F\\cup A$.  Since $F_A\\setminus F=A$, the $F_A$'s are distinct.  Therefore, there are at least $2^\\beta$ maximal forests in $F_0 \\cup F$.  The maximal forest $F$ consists of a spanning tree in each component of $G$; therefore, the vertex sets of components of $F$ are the same as those of $G$, and so are those of $F_0 \\cup F$.  Therefore, a maximal forest in $F_0 \\cup F$, which consists of a spanning tree in each component of $F_0 \\cup F$, contains a spanning tree of each component of $G$.  \n\nWe conclude that a maximal forest in $F_0 \\cup F$ is a maximal forest of $G$ and hence that there are at least $2^\\beta$ maximal forests in $G$, i.e., $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(G)| \\geq 2^{\\beta}$. \nSince $G$ is a subgraph of $K_{\\beta}$, and since $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(K_{\\beta})| = 2^{\\beta}$ by Lemma \\ref{l2.5}, we have $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(G)|\\leq 2^{\\beta}$.  \nTherefore $|{\\mathfrak{N}}(G)|=2^{\\beta}$. That is, the order of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $2^{\\beta}$.  By Lemmas \\ref{fg-order} and \\ref{edge-count}, that is also the number of edges of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$.\n\nFor the second part, note that $G$ has infinite order or else $\\beta_1(G)$ would be finite.  If $G$ has no isolated vertices and no isthmi, then $|V(G)|=|E(G)|$ by Lemma \\ref{edge-count}.  By part (i) there are $\\beta$ edges of $G$ outside a maximal forest; hence $\\beta\\leq|E(G)|$.  \n\nSince every edge of $G$ is in a cycle, by the axiom of choice we can choose a cycle $C(e)$ containing $e$ for each edge $e$ of $G$.  Let $\\mathfrak{C}=\\{C(e) : e \\in E(G)\\}$.  The total number of pairs $(f,C)$ such that $f\\in C\\in \\mathfrak{C}$ is no more than $\\aleph_0.|\\mathfrak{C}| \\leq \\aleph_0.|\\mathfrak{C}(G)| = \\aleph_0.\\beta = \\beta$.  This number of pairs is not less than the number of edges, so $|E(G)|\\leq\\beta$.\nIt follows that $G$ has exactly $\\beta$ edges.\n\n\niii) Let $F$ be a maximal forest of $G$.  By part (i), $|E(G)\\setminus E(F)|=\\beta$. \nBy adding any edge $e$ from $E(G)\\setminus E(F)$ to $F$ we get a cycle $C$.  Removing any edge other than $e$ from the cycle $C$ gives a new maximal forest which differs by exactly one edge with $F$.  The number of maximal forests we get in this way is $\\beta_1(G)$ because there are $\\beta_1(G)$ ways to choose $e$ and a finite number of edges of $C$ to choose to remove, and $\\beta_1(G)$ is infinite.  Thus we get $\\beta$ maximal forests of $G$, each of which differs by exactly one edge with $F$.  Every such maximal forest is generated by this construction.  Therefore, the degree of any vertex in ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $\\beta$.\n\n\niv) Let $A$ be a connected component of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$.  As ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $\\beta$-regular by part (iii), it follows that $|V(A)|\\geq \\beta$.  \nFix a vertex $v$ in $A$ and define the $n^{\\text{th}}$ neighborhood $D_n=\\{v':d(v,v')=n\\}$ for each $n$ in $\\mathbb{N}$.  \nSince every vertex has degree $\\beta$, $|D_0|=1$, $|D_1|=\\beta$ and $|D_k|\\leq \\beta|D_{k-1}|$. Thus, by induction on $n$, $|D_n|\\leq \\beta$ for $n>0$. \n\nSince $A$ is connected, it follows that $V(A)=\\bigcup_{i\\in \\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{0\\}}D_i$, i.e., $V(A)$ is the countable union of sets of order $\\beta$.  Therefore $|A|=\\beta$, as $|\\mathbb{N}|.\\beta'=\\beta'$. Hence any connected component of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has $\\beta$ vertices.  By Lemma \\ref{edge-count} it has $\\beta$ edges.\n\n\nv) By parts (ii, iv) the order of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $2^{\\beta}$ and the order of each component of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $\\beta$.  \nSince $|{\\mathbf{F}}(G)|=2^{\\beta}$, ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has at most $2^{\\beta}$ components.  \nSuppose that ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has $\\beta'$ components where $\\beta'<2^{\\beta}$.  As each component has $\\beta$ vertices, it follows that ${\\mathbf{F}}(G$) has order at most $\\beta'.\\beta=\\max\\{\\beta',\\beta \\}$. \nThis is a contradiction to part (ii).  Therefore ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has exactly $2^{\\beta}$ components.\n\n\nvi) Let $A$ be a component of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$.  Since it is infinite, by part (iv) it has exactly $\\beta$ edges.  \nSuppose that $|\\mathfrak{C}(A)|=\\beta'$.  \nThen $\\beta'$ is at most the number of finite subsets of $E(A)$, which is $\\beta$ since $|E(A)|=\\beta$ is infinite; that is, $\\beta'\\leq\\beta$.  \nBy the argument in part (iii) every edge of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ lies on a cycle.  The length of each cycle is finite.  Thus $A$ has at most $\\aleph_0.\\beta'=\\max \\{ \\beta', \\aleph_0 \\}=\\beta'$ edges if $\\beta'$ is infinite and it has a finite number of edges if $\\beta'$ is finite.  Since $|E(A)|=\\beta$, which is infinite, $\\beta'\\geq\\beta$.  We conclude that $\\beta'=\\beta$.\n\nvii) By parts (v, vi) ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has $2^{\\beta}$ components and each component has $\\beta$ cycles.  Since every cycle is contained in a component, $|\\mathfrak{C}({\\mathbf{F}}(G))| = \\beta.2^{\\beta}=2^{\\beta}$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above proposition it follows that an infinite graph cannot be a forest graph unless every component has the same infinite order $\\beta$ and there are $2^{\\beta}$ components.  A consequence is that the infinite graph itself must have order $2^{\\beta}$.  Hence, \n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{not2power}\nAny infinite graph whose order is not a power of $2$, including $\\aleph_0$ and all other limit cardinals, is not a forest graph.\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{l2.14}\nFor a graph $G$ the following statements are equivalent.  \n \\begin{description}\n  \\item[i)]   ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is connected.\n  \\item[ii)]  ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is finite.\n  \\item[iii)] The union of all cycles in $G$ is a finite graph.\n \\end{description}\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n(i)$\\implies$(iii).  Suppose that ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is connected. If $G$ has infinitely many cycles then by Proposition \\ref{2.8}(v) ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is disconnected. Therefore $G$ has finitely many cycles. \nLet $A = \\{ e \\in E(G) : \\text{edge $e$ lies on a cycle in } G\\}$.  Then $|A|$ is finite because the length of each cycle is finite.  That proves (iii).  \n\n(iii)$\\implies$(ii).  As every maximal forest of $G$ consists of a maximal forest of $A$ and all the edges of $G$ which are not in $A$, $G$ has at most $2^n$ maximal forests where $n=|A|$. Hence ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ has a finite number of vertices and consequently is finite.\n\n(ii)$\\implies$(i).  By identifying vertices in different components (Whitney vertex identification; see Section \\ref{roots}) we can assume $G$ is connected so ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)={\\mathbf{T}}(G)$.  Cummins \\cite{cummins1966hamilton} proved that the tree graph of a finite graph is Hamiltonian; therefore it is connected.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{${\\mathbf{F}}$-Roots}\\label{roots}\n\nIn this section we establish properties of ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots of graphs.  We begin with the question of what an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root should be.\n\n\n\n\nSince any graph $H'$ that is isomorphic to an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root $H$ of $G$ is immediately also an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root, the number of non-isomorphic ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots is a better question than the number of labeled ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots.  \nWe now show in some detail that a still better question is the number of non-isomorphic ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots without isthmi.  \n\nLet $t_\\beta$ be the number of non-isomorphic rooted trees of order $\\beta$.  We note that $t_{\\aleph_0}\\geq2^{\\aleph_0}$, by a construction of Reinhard Diestel (personal communication, July 10, 2015).  \n(We do not know a corresponding lower bound on $t_\\beta$ for $\\beta>\\aleph_0$.)\nLet $P$ be a one-way infinite path whose vertices are labelled by natural numbers, with root 1; choose any subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{N}$ and attach two edges at every vertex in $S$, forming a rooted tree $T_S$ (rooted at 1).  Then $S$ is determined by $T_S$ because the vertices in $S$ are those of degree at least 3 in $T_S$.  (If $2\\in S$ but $1 \\notin S$, then vertex $1$ is determined only up to isomorphism by $T_S$, but $S$ itself is determined uniquely.)  The number of sets $S$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, hence $t_{\\aleph_0}\\geq2^{\\aleph_0}$.  \n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{l4.1}\nLet $G$ be a graph with an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root of order $\\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is finite, then $G$ has infinitely many non-isomorphic finite ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots.  \nIf $\\alpha$ is finite or infinite, then $G$ has at least $t_\\beta$ non-isomorphic ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots of order $\\beta$ for every infinite $\\beta \\geq \\alpha$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a graph which has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root $H$, i.e., ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)\\cong G$, and let $\\alpha$ be the order of $H$.  We may assume $H$ has no isthmi and no isolated vertices unless it is $K_1$.\n\nSuppose $\\alpha$ is finite; then let $T$ be a tree, disjoint from $H$, of any finite order $n$.  Identify any vertex $v$ of $H$ with any vertex $w$ of $T$.  The resulting graph $H_T$ also has $G$ as its forest graph since $T$ is contained in every maximal forest of $H_T$.  As the order of $H_T$ is $\\alpha+n-1$ and $n$ can be any natural number, the graphs $H_T$ are an infinite number of non-isomorphic finite graphs with the same forest graph up to isomorphism.\n\nSuppose $\\alpha$ is finite or infinite and $\\beta \\geq \\alpha$ is infinite.  Let $T$ be a rooted tree of order $\\beta$ with root vertex $w$; for instance, $T$ can be a star rooted at the star center.  Attach $T$ to a vertex $v$ of $H$ by identifying $v$ with the root vertex $w$.  Denote the resulting graph by $H_T$; it is an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root of $G$ and it has order $\\beta$ because it has order $\\alpha+\\beta$, which equals $\\beta$ because $\\beta$ is infinite and $\\beta\\geq\\alpha$.  \nAs $H$ has no isthmi, $T$ and $w$ are determined by $H_T$; therefore, if we have a non-isomorphic rooted tree $T'$ with root $w'$ (that means there is no isomorphism of $T$ with $T'$ in which $w$ corresponds to $w'$), $H_{T'}$ is not isomorphic to $H_T$.  (The one exception is when $H=K_1$, which is easy to treat separately.)  The number of non-isomorphic ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots of $G$ of order $\\beta$ is therefore at least the number of non-isomorphic rooted trees of order $\\beta$, i.e., $t_\\beta$.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\nProposition \\ref{l4.1} still does not capture the essence of the number of ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots.  Whitney's \\emph{2-operations} on a graph $G$ are the following \\cite{whitney1933-2isom}:\n\\begin{enumerate}[\\quad (1)]\n\\item \\emph{Whitney vertex identification.}  Identify a vertex in one component of $G$ with a vertex in a another component of $G$, thereby reducing the number of components by 1.  For an infinite graph we modify this by allowing an infinite number of vertex identifications; specifically, let $W$ be a set of vertices with at most one from each component of $G$, and let $\\{W_i: i\\in I\\}$ be a partition of $W$ into $|I|$ sets (where $I$ is any index set); then for each $i\\in I$ we identify all the vertices in $W_i$ with each other.  \n\\item \\emph{Whitney vertex splitting.}  The reverse of vertex identification.  \n\\item \\emph{Whitney twist.}  If $u,v$ are two vertices that separate $G$---that is, $G=G_1\\cup G_2$ where $G_1\\cap G_2=\\{u,v\\}$ and $|V(G_1)|, |V(G_2)|>2$, then reverse the names $u$ and $v$ in $G_2$ and then take the union $G_1\\cup G_2$ (so vertex $u$ in $G_1$ is identified with the former vertex $v$ in $G_2$ and $v$ with the former vertex $u$).  Call the new graph $G'$.  For an infinite graph we allow an infinite number of Whitney twists.  \n\\end{enumerate}\nIt is easy to see that the edge sets of maximal forests in $G$ and $G'$ are identical, hence ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ and ${\\mathbf{F}}(G')$ are naturally isomorphic.  It follows by Whitney vertex identification that every graph with an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root has a connected ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root, and it follows from Whitney vertex splitting that every graph with an $F$-root has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root without cut vertices.\n\nWe may conclude from Proposition \\ref{l4.1} that the most interesting question about the number of ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots of a graph $G$ that has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root is not the total number of non-isomorphic ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots (which by Proposition \\ref{l4.1} cannot be assigned any cardinality); it is not the number of a given order; it is not even the number that have no isthmi; it is the number of non-2-isomorphic, connected ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots with no isthmi and (except when $G=K_1$) no isolated vertices.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not know which graphs have ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots, but we do know two large classes that cannot have ${\\mathbf{F}}$-roots.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{t4.1}\nNo infinite connected graph has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nThis follows by Corollary \\ref{l2.14}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{l4.2}\nNo bipartite graph $G$ has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof} Let $G$ be a bipartite graph of order $p$ $(p\\geq2)$ and let $H$ be a root of $G$, i.e., ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)\\cong G$.\nSuppose $H$ has no cycle; then ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)$ is $K_{1}$, which is a contradiction. Therefore $H$ has a cycle of length $\\geq 3$. It follows by Lemma \\ref{cycle-kn} that ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)$ contains $K_{3}$, a contradiction. Hence no bipartite graph $G$ has a root.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{${\\mathbf{F}}$-Convergence and ${\\mathbf{F}}$-Divergence}\\label{convergence}\n\nIn this section we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergence of a graph.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{l3}\nLet $G$ be a finite graph that contains a $C_n$ (for $n\\geq4$) or at least two edge disjoint triangles; then $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a finite graph.\nBy Lemma \\ref{l2.2}, ${\\mathbf{F}}^m(G)$ contains $K_{m^2}$ as a subgraph. Therefore, as $m$ increases the clique size of ${\\mathbf{F}}^m(G)$ increases. Hence $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent. \n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{l3.4}\nIf $|\\mathfrak{C}(G)| = \\beta$ where $\\beta$ is infinite, then $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent.\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nAssume $|\\mathfrak{C}(G)|=\\beta$ ($\\beta$ infinite).  By Proposition \\ref{2.8}(vii), \nas $2^{\\beta}<2^{2^{\\beta}}<2^{2^{2^{\\beta}}}<\\cdots$, it follows that $|\\mathfrak{C}({\\mathbf{F}}(G))|<|\\mathfrak{C}({\\mathbf{F}}^2(G))|<|\\mathfrak{C}({\\mathbf{F}}^3(G))|<\\cdots$. Therefore, as $n$ increases $|\\mathfrak{C}({\\mathbf{F}}^n(G))|$ increases.  Hence $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{t3.1}\nLet $G$ be a graph. Then,\n\\begin{description}\n  \\item[i)] $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergent if and only if either $G$ is acyclic or $G$ has only one cycle, which is of length $3$.\n  \\item[ii)] If $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergent, then it converges in at most two steps.\n   \\end{description}\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\ni) If $G$ has no cycle, then it is a forest and ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $K_1$.  If $G$ has only one cycle and that cycle has length $3$, then ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ is $K_3$. Therefore in each case $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergent.\n\nConversely, suppose that $G$ has a cycle of length greater than $3$ or has at least two triangles.  \nIf G has infinitely many cycles, then it follows by Lemma \\ref{l3.4} that $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent.\nTherefore we may assume that $G$ has a finite number of cycles.  If $G$ has a finite number of vertices, then it is finite and by Lemma \\ref{l3} it is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent.  Therefore $G$ has an infinite number of vertices.  However, it can have only a finite number of edges that are not isthmi, because each cycle is finite.  Thus $G$ consists of a finite graph $G_0$ and any number of isthmi and isolated vertices.  Since ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ depends only on the edges that are not isthmi and the vertices that are not isolated, ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)={\\mathbf{F}}(G_0)$ (under the natural identification of maximal forests in $G_0$ with their extensions in $G$ by adding all isthmi of $G$).  Therefore, $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent.\n\nii) If $G$ has no cycle, then $G$ is a forest and ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)\\cong{\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)\\cong K_1$. If $G$ has only one cycle, which is of length 3, then ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)\\cong{\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)\\cong K_3$.  Therefore $G$ converges in at most 2 steps.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{c3.1}\nA graph $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-stable if and only if $G = K_1$ or $K_3$.\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{${\\mathbf{F}}$-Depth}\\label{depth}\n\nIn this section we establish results about the ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of a graph.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{l5.1}\nLet $G$ be a finite graph.  The ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of $G$ is infinite if and only if $G$ is $K_{1}$ or $K_{3}$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a finite graph.\nSuppose that $G$ is $K_1$ or $K_3$. Then by Corollary \\ref{c3.1}, it follows that $G$ is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-stable. Therefore, the ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of $G$ is infinite.\n\nConversely, suppose that $G$ is different from $K_{1}$ and $K_{3}$.\n\n\\textbf{Case 1:}  Let $|V|<4$.  \nThen $G$ has no ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root so its ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth is zero.\n\n\\textbf{Case 2:}  Let $|V|=4$.  \nSuppose $G$ has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root $H$ (i.e., ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)\\cong G$).  Then $H$ should have exactly $4$ maximal forests. That is possible only when $H$ has only one cycle, which is of length $4$.  By Lemma \\ref{cycle-kn} it follows that ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)$ contains $K_4$, hence it is $K_4$. Therefore $G$ has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root if and only if it is $K_4$.  Hence the ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of $G$ is zero, except that the depth of $K_4$ is 1. \n\n\\textbf{Case 3:}  Let $|V|=n$ where $n>4$.\nSuppose that $G$ has infinite ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth. Then for every $m$ there is a graph $H_{m}$ such that ${\\mathbf{F}}^{m}(H_{m})=G$.  If $H_{m}$ does not have two triangles or a cycle of length greater than $3$, then $H_{m}$ has only one cycle which is of length $3$, or no cycle and $H_{m}$ converges  to $K_{1}$ or $K_{3}$ in at most two steps, a contradiction. Therefore $H_{m}$ has two triangles or a cycle of length greater than $3$.  By Lemma \\ref{l2.2} it follows that ${\\mathbf{F}}^{m}(H_{m})$ contains $K_{m^{2}}$ for each $m\\geq2$, so that in particular ${\\mathbf{F}}^{n}(H_{n})$ contains $K_{n^{2}}$.  That is, $G$ contains $K_{n^2}$.\nThis is impossible as $G$ has order $n$.  Hence the ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of $G$ is finite.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{t5.2}\nThe ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of any infinite graph is finite.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nLet $G$ be a graph of infinite order $\\alpha$.  If $G$ has an ${\\mathbf{F}}$-root, then $G$ is without isthmi or isolated vertices.\n\nIf $G$ is connected, Theorem \\ref{t4.1} implies that $G$ has no root. Therefore its ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth is zero.\n\nIf $G$ is disconnected, assume it has infinite depth.  Then for each natural number $n$ there exists a graph $H_n$ such that $G\\cong{\\mathbf{F}}^n(H_n)$.  \nLet $\\beta_n$ denote the order of $H_n$.  Since ${\\mathbf{F}}(H_1)\\cong G$, by Proposition \\ref{2.8}(ii) $\\alpha=2^{\\beta_1}$, from which we infer that $\\beta_1<\\alpha$.  \nThis is independent of which root $H_1$ is, so in particular we can take $H_1={\\mathbf{F}}(H_2)$ and conclude that $\\beta_1=2^{\\beta_2}$, hence that $\\beta_2<\\beta_1$.  \nContinuing in like manner we get an infinite decreasing sequence of cardinal numbers starting with $\\alpha$.  The cardinal numbers are well ordered \\cite{kamke1950theory}, so they cannot contain such an infinite sequence.  It follows that the ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of $G$ must be finite.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgements} This work was supported by DST-CMS project Lr.No.SR/S4/MS:516/07, Dt.21-04-2008.\n\nT.~Zaslavsky also thanks the C.R.\\ Rao Advanced Institute of Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science for its hospitality during the initiation of this paper.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n{\\bibitem}{broersma1996connectivity}\n{H.J.~Broersma and Xueliang Li},\n{\\em The connectivity of the leaf-exchange spanning tree graph of a graph}.\n{Ars Combinatoria}, 43:225--231 (1996).\n\n{\\bibitem}{cummins1966hamilton}\n{R.~Cummins},\n{\\em Hamilton circuits in tree graphs}.\n{IEEE Transactions on Circuit Theory}, CT-13(1):82--90 (1966).\n\n{\\bibitem}{das2013number}\n{Kinkar~C.~Das, Ahmet~S.~Cevik, and Ismail~N.~Cangul},\n{\\em The number of spanning trees of a graph}.\n{Journal of Inequalities and Applications}, 2013(1):article 395, 13 pages (2013).\n\n{\\bibitem}{das2007sharp}\n{Kinkar~Ch.~Das},\n{\\em A sharp upper bound for the number of spanning trees of a graph}.\n{Graphs and Combinatorics}, 23(6):625--632 (2007).\n\n{\\bibitem}{diestel2005graph}\n{Reinhard Diestel},\n{Graph Theory}, Third edition. {Graduate Texts in Mathematics, volume 173}.\nSpringer, Heidelberg, {2005}.\n\n{\\bibitem}{fengTAmatching}\nLihua Feng, Kexiang Xu, Kinkar~Ch.~Das, Aleksandar Ili\\'c, and Guihai Yu, \n{\\em The number of spanning trees of a graph with given matching number}.\nInternational Journal of Computer Mathematics, in press.

The tree graph of a connected graph need not be connected. To obviate this difficulty we define the ``forest graph'': let $G$ be a labeled graph of order $\\alpha$, finite or infinite, and let ${\\mathfrak{N}}(G)$ be the set of all labeled maximal forests of $G$. The forest graph of $G$, denoted by ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$, is the graph with vertex set ${\\mathfrak{N}}(G)$ in which two maximal forests $F_1$, $F_2$ of $G$ form an edge if and only if they differ exactly by one edge, i.e., $F_2 = F_1 -e +f$ for some edges $e\\in F_1$ and $f\\notin F_1$.\n\nUsing the theory of cardinal numbers, Zorn's lemma, transfinite induction, the axiom of choice and the well-ordering principle, we determine the ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergence, ${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergence, ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth and ${\\mathbf{F}}$-stability of any graph $G$. In particular it is shown that a graph $G$ (finite or infinite) is ${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergent if and only if $G$ has at most one cycle of length 3. The ${\\mathbf{F}}$-stable graphs are precisely $K_3$ and $K_1$. The ${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth of any graph $G$ different from $K_3$ and $K_1$ is finite.  We also determine various parameters of ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$ for an infinite graph $G$, including the number, order, size, and degree of its components.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\textbf{Keywords:} Forest graph operator; Graph dynamics.\\\\\n\n\\textbf{Mathematics Subject Clasification 2010:} {Primary 05C76; Secondary 05C05, 05C63}\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\normalsize\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nA \\emph{graph dynamical system} is a set $X$ of graphs together with a mapping $\\phi: X\\rightarrow X$ (see Prisner \\cite{prisner1995graph}).  We investigate the graph dynamical system on finite and infinite graphs defined by the forest graph operator ${\\mathbf{F}}$, which transforms $G$ to its graph of maximal forests.  \n\nLet $G$ be a labeled graph of order $\\alpha$, finite or infinite. (All our graphs are labeled.) A \\emph{spanning tree} of $G$ is a connected, acyclic, spanning subgraph of $G$; it exists if and only if $G$ is connected. \nAny acyclic subgraph of $G$, connected or not, is called a \\emph{forest} of $G$. A forest $F$ of $G$ is said to be \\emph{maximal} if there is no forest $F'$ of $G$ such that $F$ is a proper subgraph of $F'$. \nThe tree graph ${\\mathbf{T}}(G)$ of $G$ has all the spanning trees of $G$ as vertices, and distinct such trees are adjacent vertices if they differ in just one edge \\cite{prisner1995graph, sureshdara2010icm}; i.e., two spanning trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ are adjacent if $T_2 = T_1 -e +f$ for some edges $e\\in T_1$ and $f\\notin T_1$. The \\emph{iterated tree graphs} of $G$ are defined by ${\\mathbf{T}}^0(G) =G$ and ${\\mathbf{T}}^n(G) = {\\mathbf{T}}({\\mathbf{T}}^{n-1}(G))$ for $n>0$. \nThere are several results on tree graphs. See \\cite{broersma1996connectivity, zhang1986connectivity, liu1988connectivities} for connectivity of the tree graph, \\cite{grimmett1976upper, rodpet1997sharp, teranishi2005number, zhang2005bound, das2007sharp, feng2008sharp, feng2010number, das2013number, fengTAmatching} for bounds on the order of ${\\mathbf{T}}(G)$ (that is, on the number of spanning trees of $G$), \\cite{cummins1966hamilton, shank1968note} for Hamilton circuits in a tree graph.\n\nThere is one difficulty with iterating the tree graph operator.  The tree graph of an infinite connected graph need not be connected \\cite{cummins1966hamilton, shank1968note}, so ${\\mathbf{T}}^2(G)$ may be undefined. For example, ${\\mathbf{T}}(K_{\\aleph_0})$ is disconnected (see Corollary \\ref{l2.d} in this paper; $\\aleph_0$ denotes the cardinality of the set $\\mathbb N$ of natural numbers); therefore ${\\mathbf{T}}^2(K_{\\aleph_0})$ is not defined. \nTo obviate this difficulty with iterated tree graphs, and inspired by the tree graph operator ${\\mathbf{T}}$, we define a forest graph operator. \nLet ${\\mathfrak{N}}(G)$ be the set of all maximal forests of $G$. The \\emph{forest graph} of $G$, denoted by ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)$, is the graph with vertex set ${\\mathfrak{N}}(G)$ in which two maximal forests $F_1$, $F_2$ form an edge if and only if they differ by exactly one edge. The \\emph{forest graph operator} (or \\emph{maximal forest operator}) on graphs, $G \\mapsto {\\mathbf{F}}(G)$, is denoted by ${\\mathbf{F}}$. \nZorn's lemma implies that every connected graph contains a spanning tree (see \\cite{diestel2005graph}); similarly, every graph has a maximal forest.  Hence, the forest graph always exists.  Since when $G$ is connected, maximal forests are the same as spanning trees, then ${\\mathbf{F}}(G)={\\mathbf{T}}(G)$; that is, the tree graph is a special case of the forest graph. \nWe write ${\\mathbf{F}}^2(G)$ to denote ${\\mathbf{F}}({\\mathbf{F}}(G))$, and in general ${\\mathbf{F}}^n(G) = {\\mathbf{F}}({\\mathbf{F}}^{n-1}(G))$ for $n \\geq 1$, with ${\\mathbf{F}}^0(G) = G$.\n\n\n\\begin{definition}\\label{d2}\nA graph $G$ is said to be \\emph{${\\mathbf{F}}$-convergent} if $\\{{\\mathbf{F}}^n(G): n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is finite; otherwise it is \\emph{${\\mathbf{F}}$-divergent}.\n\nA graph $H$ is said to be an \\emph{${\\mathbf{F}}$-root} of $G$ if ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)$ is isomorphic to $G$, ${\\mathbf{F}}(H)\\cong G$.\nThe \\emph{${\\mathbf{F}}$-depth} of $G$ is \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "$$\\sup \\{n \\in  \\mathbb{N} : G\\cong {\\mathbf{F}}^n(H) \\text{ for some graph } H\\}.$$\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\sup\\{n\\in\\mathbb{N}:G\\cong{\\mathbf{F}}^{n}(H)\\text{ for some graph }H\\}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">sup</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mi>\u2115</mi></mrow><mo>:</mo><mrow><mi>G</mi><mo>\u2245</mo><mrow><msup><mi>\ud835\udc05</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>\u00a0for some graph\u00a0</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>H</mi></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
