In working\ntoward a rather different understanding of quantum mechanics he has been\nforemost in my mind as a severe but honest critic of such attempts. We all\nwould love to know what Einstein would have made of Bell's theorem. I\nconfess the deep regret I feel that Bell cannot respond to this paper is\nsometimes assuaged by a sense of relief.\n\n\\section{Locality and Local Causality}\n\nIn his seminal 1964 paper, John Bell expressed locality as the requirement\n\n\\begin{quote}\nthat the result of a measurement on one system be unaffected by operations\non a distant system with which it has interacted in the past. [2004, p. 14]\n\\end{quote}\n\nThis seems to require that the result of a measurement would have been the\nsame, no matter what operations had been performed on such a distant system.\nBut suppose the result of a measurement were the outcome of an\nindeterministic process. Then the result of the measurement might have been\ndifferent even if exactly the same operations (if any) had been performed on\nthat distant system. So can no indeterministic theory satisfy the locality\nrequirement? Bell felt no need to address that awkward question in his 1964\npaper, since he took\\ the EPR argument to establish that any additional\nvariables needed to restore locality and causality would have to determine a\nunique result of a measurement. Indeterminism was not an option:\n\n\\begin{quote}\nSince we can predict in advance the result of measuring any chosen component\nof $\\mathbf{\\sigma }_{2}$ [in the Bohm-EPR\\ scenario], by previously\nmeasuring the same component of $\\mathbf{\\sigma }_{1}$, it follows that the\nresult of any such measurement must actually be predetermined. (\\textit{op.\ncit.}, p. 15)\n\\end{quote}\n\nAfterwards he repeatedly stressed that any theory proposed as an attempt to\ncomplete quantum theory while restoring locality and causality need not be \n\\textit{assumed} to be deterministic: to recover such perfect\n(anti)correlations it would \\textit{have} to be deterministic. This argument\nwarrants closer examination, and I'll come back to it. But in later work\nBell offered formulations of locality conditions tailored to theories that\nwere not deterministic.\n\n\\qquad An initial motivation may have been to facilitate experimental tests\nof attempted local, causal completions of quantum mechanics by suitable\nmeasurements of spin or polarization components on pairs of separated\nsystems represented by entangled quantum states. Inevitable apparatus\nimperfections would make it impossible to confirm a quantum prediction of\nperfect (anti)correlation for matched components, so experiment alone could\nnot require a local, causal theory to reproduce them. Einstein himself\nthought some theory might come to underlie quantum mechanics much as\nstatistical mechanics underlies thermodynamics. In each case there would be\ncircumstances in which the more basic theory (correctly) predicts deviations\nfrom behavior the less basic theory leads one to expect.\n\n\\qquad But by 1975 a second motivation had become apparent---the hope that\nby revising or reformulating quantum mechanics as a theory of local beables\none might remove ambiguity and arrive at increased precision. It is in this\ncontext that Bell now introduces a requirement of local causality. This\ndiffers in two ways from his earlier locality requirement. It is not a\nrequirement on the world, but on theories of local beables: and it applies\nto theories that are probabilistic, with deterministic theories treated as a\nspecial case in which all probabilities are 0 or 1 (and densities are delta\nfunctions).\\footnote{\nWhile Bell did not make this explicit in 1975, his 1990 paper also notes the\nanalogy with source-free Maxwellian electromagnetism, and there he does say:\n\\par\n\\begin{quote}\nThe deterministic case is a limit of the probabilistic case, the\nprobabilities becoming delta functions. [2004, p. 240]\n\\end{quote}\n} Bell ([1975], [1985]) designs his requirement of local causality as a\ngeneralization of a requirement of local determinism met by Maxwell's\nelectromagnetic theory. In source-free Maxwellian electromagnetism, the\nlocal beables are the values of the electric and magnetic fields at each\npoint $(\\mathbf{x},t)$. This theory is locally deterministic because the\nfield values in a space-time region are uniquely determined by their values\nat an earlier moment in a finite volume of space that fully closes the\nbackward light cone of that region.\n\n\\qquad Local causality arises by generalizing to theories in which the\nassignment of values to some beables $\\Lambda $ implies, not necessarily a\nparticular value, but a probability distribution $Pr(A|\\Lambda )$, for\nanother beable $A$. Here is how Bell ([2004, p. 54]) defines it (in my\nnotation):\n\n\\begin{quote}\nLet $N$ denote a specification of \\textit{all} the beables, of some theory,\nbelonging to the overlap of the backward light cones of space-like separated\nregions 1 and 2. Let $\\Lambda $ be a specification of some beables from the\nremainder of the backward light cone of 1, and $B$ of some beables in the\nregion 2. Then in a \\textit{locally causal theory} $Pr(A|\\Lambda\n,N,B)=Pr(A|\\Lambda ,N)$ whenever both probabilities are given by the theory.\n\\end{quote}\n\nIf $M$ is a specification of some beables from the backward light cone of 2\nbut not of 1, then (assuming the joint probability distribution $\nPr(A,B|\\Lambda ,M,N)$ exists)\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nPr(A,B|\\Lambda ,M,N) &=&Pr(A|\\Lambda ,M,N,B).Pr(B|\\Lambda ,M,N)  \\label{1} \\\\\n&=&Pr(A|\\Lambda ,N).Pr(B|\\Lambda ,M)  \\label{2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere (\\ref{1}) follows from the definition of conditional probability, and (\n\\ref{2}) follows for any locally causal theory. This means that any theory\nof local beables that is locally causal satisfies the condition\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nPr(A,B|\\Lambda ,M,N)=Pr(A|\\Lambda ,N).Pr(B|\\Lambda ,M)  \\label{3}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Pr(A,B|\\Lambda,M,N)=Pr(A|\\Lambda,N).Pr(B|\\Lambda,M)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo><mi>P</mi><mi>r</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039b</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>M</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00106.tex", "nexttext": "\nNot only did this proof not assume the theory of local beables was\ndeterministic, even this (Factorizability) condition was not assumed but\nderived from the reformulated local causality requirement.\n\nBell's formulation of local causality (LC) has been carefully analyzed by\nNorsen [2011], whose analysis has been further improved by Seevinck and\nUffink [2011].

But Bell himself said we should regard his step from (IP) to (LC)\nwith the utmost suspicion, and that is what I shall do. My grounds for\nsuspicion are my belief that quantum mechanics \\textit{itself} helps us to\nexplain the particular correlations violating CHSH inequalities that Bell\n[2004, pp. 151-2] claimed to be locally inexplicable without action at a\ndistance. Moreover, that explanation involves no superluminal action, and\nthere is even a sense in which it is local.\n\nTo assess the status of (LC) (or (LC)$_{SU}$) in quantum mechanics one needs\nto say first how it is applied to yield probabilities attached to values of\nlocal beables in a space-time region 1 and then what it would be for these\nto be altered by specification of values of local beables in a space-like\nseparated region 2. This is not a straightforward matter. The Born rule may\nbe correctly applied to yield more than one chance for the same event in\nregion 1, and there is more than one way to understand the requirement that\nthese chances be unaltered by what happens in region 2. As we'll see, the\nupshot is that while Born rule probabilities do violate (\\ref\n{Factorizability}) (or (\\ref{FactorizabilitySU})) here, this counts as a\nviolation of (LC) (or (LC)$_{SU}$) only if that condition is applied in a\nway that is not motivated by (IP)'s prohibition of space-like causal\ninfluences.\n\n\\section{Probability and chance}\n\nBell credited his formulation of local causality (LC) with avoiding the\n\"rather vague notions\" of cause and effect by replacing them with a\ncondition of probabilistic independence. The connection to (IP)'s motivating\ntalk of `cause' and `effect' is provided by the thought that a cause alters\n(and typically raises) the chance of its effect. But this connection can be\nmade only by using the general probabilities supplied by a theory to supply\nchances of particular events.\n\nBy chance I mean the definite, single-case probability of an individual\nevent such as rain tomorrow in Tucson. As in this example, its chance\ndepends on \\textit{when} the event occurs---afterwards, it is always 0 or 1:\nand it may vary up until that time as history unfolds. Chance is important\nbecause of its conceptual connections to belief and action. The chance of $e$\nprovides an agent's best guide to how strongly to believe that $e$ occurs,\nwhen not in a position to be certain that it does.\\footnote{\nI use the \\textquotedblleft tenseless present\\textquotedblright\\ rather than\nthe more idiomatic future tense here for reasons that will soon become clear.\n} And the comparison between $e$'s chances according as (s)he does or does\nnot do $D$ are critical in the agent's decision about whether to do $D$.\nThese connections explain why the chance of an event defaults to 0 or 1 when\nthe agent is in a position to be certain about it---typically, after it does\nor doesn't occur.\n\nProbabilistic theories may be useful guides to the chances of events, but\nwhat they directly yield are not chances but general probabilities of the\nform $\\Pr_{C}(E)$ for an event of type $E$ relative to reference class $C$.\nTo apply such a general probability to yield the chance of $e$, you need to\nspecify the type $E$ of $e$ and also the reference class $C$. A\nprobabilistic theory may offer alternative specifications when applied to\ndetermine the chance of $e$, in which case it becomes necessary to choose\nthe appropriate specifications. Actuarial tables may be helpful when\nestimating the chance that you will live to be 100, but you differ in all\nkinds of ways from every individual whose death figures in those tables.\nWhat you want is the most complete available specification of \\textit{your}\nsituation: this may include much irrelevant information, but it's not\nnecessary to exclude this since it won't affect the chance anyway. In\nMinkowski space-time, the conceptual connection between chance ($Ch$) and\nthe degree of belief ($Cr$) it prescribes is captured in this version of\nDavid Lewis's Principal Principle that implicitly defines chance:\\footnote{\nSee Ismael [2008]. I have slightly altered her notation to avoid conflict\nwith my own. Here `$e$' ambiguously denotes both an event and the\nproposition that it occurs. $Cr$ stands for credence: an agent's degree of\nbelief in a proposition, represented on a scale from 0 to 1 and required to\nconform to the standard axioms of probability.}\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThe chance of $e$ at $p$, conditional on any information $I_{p}$ about the\ncontents of $p$'s past light cone satisfies: $Cr_{p}(e/I_{p})=_{df}Ch_{p}(e)$\n.\n\\end{quote}\n\nNow consider an agent who accepts quantum theory and wishes to determine the\nchance of the event $e_{A}$ that the next photon detected by Alice registers\nas vertically polarized ($V_{A}$). Assuming that the state $\\left\\vert \\Phi\n^{+}\\right\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left( \\left\\vert H\\right\\rangle\n\\left\\vert H\\right\\rangle +\\left\\vert V\\right\\rangle \\left\\vert\nV\\right\\rangle \\right) $ was prepared and the settings $a,b$ chosen long\nbefore, the agent is also in a position to be certain what these were. The\nagent is then in a position to use the Born rule to determine the chance of $\ne_{A}$. But that chance must be relativized not just to a time, but\n(relativistically) to a space-time point.

But does that constitute a violation of local causality? (LC) and (LC$\n_{SU}$) are both conditions straightforwardly applicable to a theory whose\ngeneral probabilities yield a \\textit{unique} chance for each possible\noutcome in $\\mathbf{1}$ prior to its occurrence. In the case of quantum\ntheory, however, the general Born rule probabilities yield \\textit{multiple}\nchances for each possible outcome in $\\mathbf{1}$, each at the same time\\\n(in the laboratory frame): $Ch_{p}(e_{A})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$, but $Ch_{q}(e_{A})=1$ (assuming the outcome in $\\mathbf{2}$ is of type $\nV_{B}$). When (LC) speaks of \\textquotedblleft \\textit{the} probabilities\nattached to [$e_{A},\\bar{e}_{A}$] in a space-time region $\\mathbf{1}$ being\nunaltered by specification of [$V_{B}$] in a space-like separated region $\n\\mathbf{2}$\\textquotedblright\\ (my italics), which probabilities are these?\n\n\\qquad Since the connection to (IP)'s motivating talk of `cause' and\n`effect' is provided by the thought that a cause alters the chance of its\neffect, (LC) is motivated only if applied to the \\textit{chances} of $e_{A},\n\\bar{e}_{A}$ in region $\\mathbf{1}$. But $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$ is \\textit{not}\naltered by specification of $V_{B}$ in space-like separated region $\\mathbf{2\n}$: its value depends only on what happens in the backward light cone of $\n\\mathbf{1}$, in conformity\\ to its role in prescribing $Cr_{p}(e_{A})$.$\\ $\nOf course $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ does depend on the outcome in $\\mathbf{2}$. If it\ndid not, it could not fulfill its constitutive role of prescribing $\nCr_{q}(e_{A}/I_{q})$ no matter what information $I_{q}$ provides about the\ncontents of $q$'s past light cone. It follows that $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ is not\naltered but \\textit{specified} by specification of the result in $\\mathbf{2}$\n.\n\n\\qquad Only for a hypothetical agent whose world-line has entered the future\nlight cone of $\\mathbf{2}$ at $q$ is it true that specification of the\nresult in $\\mathbf{2}$\\ permits a 100\\% confident prediction of the\npreviously totally uncertain result on the other side.

That is why\nit is $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$, not $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$, that says what is certain at $p$\n. Newtonian absolute time fostered the illusion of the occurrence of future\nevents becoming certain for everyone at the same time---when they occur if\nnot sooner. Relativity requires certainty, like chance, to be relativized to\nspace-time points---idealized locations of hypothetical knowers.\n\n\\qquad So does ordinary quantum mechanics violate local causality? If\n\\textquotedblleft the probabilities\\textquotedblright\\ (LC) speaks of are $\nPr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A}),$ $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(H_{A})$, and the\ncondition that these be unaltered is understood to be that $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(V_{A})=Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A}|B),$ $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(H_{A})=Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(H_{A}|B)$, then ordinary quantum mechanics\nviolates (LC). But if this is all (LC) means, then it is not motivated by\n(IP) and its violation does not imply that the quantum world is non-local in\nthat there are superluminal causal relations between distant events. For\n(LC) to be motivated by causal considerations such as (IP),\n\\textquotedblleft the probabilities\\textquotedblright\\ (LC) speaks of must\nbe understood to be chances, including $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$ and $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$.\nBut neither of these would be altered by the specification of the outcome [$\nV_{B}$] in a space-like separated region, so local causality would then not\nbe violated. Although it remains unclear exactly how (LC) (or (LC$_{SU}$))\nis supposed to be applied to quantum mechanics, one way of applying it is\nunmotivated by (IP), while if it is applied in another way quantum mechanics\ndoes \\textit{not} violate this local causality condition.\n\n\\section{Chance and Causation}\n\nSuppose in the EPR-Bohm scenario that the outcome in region $\\mathbf{2}$ had\nbeen of type $H_{B}$ instead of $V_{B}$: then $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would have\nbeen 0 instead of 1. Suppose that the polarization axis for the measurement\nin region $\\mathbf{2}$ had been rotated through $60\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$: then $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would have been \n\n\n$\\frac14$\n\nor \n\n\n$\\frac34$\n\n, depending on the outcome in region $\\mathbf{2}$. Or suppose that no\npolarization measurement had been performed in region $\\mathbf{2}$: then $\nCh_{q}(e_{A})$ would have been \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n. This shows that $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ depends counterfactually on the\npolarization measurement in $\\mathbf{2}$ and also on its outcome. Another\nway to understand talk of \\textquotedblleft alteration\\textquotedblright\\ of\n\\textquotedblleft the\\textquotedblright\\ probability of an event of type $\nV_{A}$ is as the difference between the actual value of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ and\nwhat its value would have been had the polarization measurement in $\\mathbf{2\n}$ or its outcome been different. Don't such counterfactual\n\\textquotedblleft alterations\\textquotedblright\\ in $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$\\ amount\nto \\textit{causal} dependence between space-like separated events, in\nviolation of (IP)? There are several reasons why they do not.\n\nThe first reason is that while $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would be different in each of\nthese counterfactual scenarios, in none of them would $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$ differ\nfrom \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n, so the \"local\" chance of $e_{A}$ is insensitive to all such counterfactual\nvariations in what happens in $\\mathbf{2}$. If one wishes to infer causal\nfrom counterfactual dependence of \\textquotedblleft the\\textquotedblright\\\nchance of a result in $\\mathbf{1}$ on what happens in $\\mathbf{2}$, then\nonly one of two relevant candidates for \\textquotedblleft\nthe\\textquotedblright\\ chance displays such counterfactual dependence. For\nthose who think of chance as itself a kind of indeterministic cause---a\nlocalized physical propensity whose actualization may produce an effect---$\nCh_{p}(e_{A})$ seems better qualified for\\ the title of \\textquotedblleft\nthe\\textquotedblright\\ chance of $e_{A}$\\ than $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$.\n\nThe role of chance in decision provides the second reason. Just as the\nchance of $e$ tells you everything you need to\\ know to figure out how\nstrongly to believe $e$, the causal dependence of $e$ on $d$ tells you\neverything you need to know about $e$ and $d$ when deciding whether to do $d$\n(assuming you are not indifferent about $e$). As Huw Price [2012] put it,\n\\textquotedblleft causal dependence should be regarded as an analyst-expert\nabout the conditional credences required by an evidential decision\nmaker\\textquotedblright .\n\nConsider the situation of a hypothetical agent Bob at $p^{\\prime }$ deciding\nwhether to act by affecting what happens in $\\mathbf{2}$ to try to get\noutcome $e_{A}$ in $\\mathbf{1}$. Bob can choose not to measure anything, or\nhe can choose to measure polarization with respect to any axis $b$. If he\nwere to measure nothing, $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would be \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n. If he were to measure polarization with respect to the same axis as Alice,\nthen $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would be either 0 or 1, with an equal chance (at his\nmomentary location $p^{\\prime }$) of either outcome. Since he\\ can neither\nknow nor affect which of these chances it will be, he must base his decision\non his best estimate of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ in accordance with Ismael's [2008]\nIgnorance Principle:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\textquotedblleft Where you're not sure about the chances, form a mixture of\nthe chances assigned by different theories of chance with weights determined\nby your relative confidence in those theories.\\textquotedblright\n\\end{quote}\n\nFollowing this principle, Bob should assign $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ the estimated\nvalue $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.0+\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.1=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$, and base his decision on that. Since measuring polarization with respect\nto the same axis as Alice would not raise his estimated chance of securing\noutcome $e_{A}$ in $\\mathbf{1}$, he should eliminate this option \\textit{\nwhether or not he could execute it}. His estimated value of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$\nwere he to measure polarization with respect to an axis rotated $60\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$ from Alice's is also \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n($\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.\n\n\n{\\frac14}\n\n+\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.\n\n\n{\\frac34}\n\n=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$). Similarly for any other angle. This essentially recapitulates part of\nthe content of the no-signalling theorems, going back to Eberhard [1978].\nBell [2004, pp. 237-8] shows why manipulation of external fields at $\np^{\\prime }$ or in $\\mathbf{2}$ would also fail to alter Bob's estimated\nvalue of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$.\n\nBut what if Bob had simply arranged for the measurement in $\\mathbf{2}$ to\nhave had the different \\textit{outcome} $\\bar{e}_{B}$? Then $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$\nwould have been 0 instead of 1. No-one who accepts quantum mechanics can\ncountenance this counterfactual scenario. The Born rule implies that $\nPr_{b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(H_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$, and anyone who accepts quantum mechanics accepts the implication that $\nCh_{p^{\\prime }}(\\bar{e}_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$. So anyone who accepts quantum mechanics will have credence $Cr_{p^{\\prime\n}}(\\bar{e}_{B}/I_{p^{\\prime }})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$ no matter what he takes to happen in the backward light cone of $p^{\\prime\n}$ (as specified by $I_{p^{\\prime }}$).\\footnote{\nA unitary evolution $\\Phi ^{+}\\Rightarrow \\Xi ^{+}$\\ corresponding to a \n\\textit{local} interaction there would still yield $Pr_{b}^{\\Xi ^{+}}(H_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$.} If he accepts quantum mechanics, Bob will conclude that there is nothing\nit makes sense to contemplate doing to alter his estimate of $Ch_{p^{\\prime\n}}(\\bar{e}_{B})$, and so there \\ is no conceivable counterfactual scenario\nin which one in Bob's position arranges for the measurement in $\\mathbf{2}$\nto have had the different outcome $\\bar{e}_{B}$. In general, there is causal\ndependence between events in $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ only if it makes\nsense to speak of an intervention in one of these regions that would affect\na hypothetical agent's estimated chance of what happens in the other. Anyone\nwho accepts quantum mechanics should deny that makes sense.\n\nPerhaps the most basic reason why counterfactual dependencies between\nhappenings in region $\\mathbf{2}$ and the chance(s) of $e_{A}$ are no sign\nof causal dependence is that chances are not beables, and are incapable of\nentering into causal relations. That Bell thought they behaved like beables\nis suggested by the [1975] paper in which he introduced local causality as a\nnatural generalization of local determinism:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\textquotedblleft In Maxwell's theory, the fields in any space-time region $\n\\mathbf{1}$ are determined by those in any space region $V$, at some time $t$\n, which fully closes the backward light cone of $\\mathbf{1}$. Because the\nregion $V$ is limited, localized, we will say the theory exhibits \\textit{\nlocal determinism}. We would like to form some no[ta]tion of \\textit{local\ncausality} in theories which are not deterministic, in which the\ncorrelations prescribed by the theory, for the beables, are\nweaker.\\textquotedblright\\ [2004, p. 53]\n\\end{quote}\n\nIt seems Bell thought the chances prescribed by a theory that is not\ndeterministic were analogous to the beables of Maxwell's electromagnetism,\nso that while local determinism (locally) specified the local[ized] beables\n(e.g. fields), local causality should (locally) specify the local[ized] \n\\textit{chances} of beables, where those chances (like local beables) are\nthemselves localized physical magnitudes.\n\nOthers have joined Bell in this view of chances as localized physical\nmagnitudes. But quantum mechanics teaches us that chances are \\textit{not}\nlocalized physical propensities whose actualization may produce an effect.\nMaudlin says what he means by calling probabilities objective:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\textquotedblleft ...there could be probabilities that arise from\nfundamental physics, probabilities that attach to actual or possible events\nin virtue solely of their physical description and independent of the\nexistence of cognizers. These are what I mean by \\textit{objective\nprobabilities}.\\textquotedblright\\ (Beisbart and Hartmann eds., [2011, p.\n294])\n\\end{quote}\n\nAlthough quantum chances do attach to actual or possible events, they are\nnot objective in this sense. As we saw, the chance of outcome $e_{A}$ does\nnot attach to it in virtue solely of its physical description: the \\textit{\nchances} of $e_{A}$ attach also in virtue of its space-time relations to\ndifferent space-time locations. Each such location offers the epistemic\nperspective of a situated agent, even in a world with no such agents. The\nexistence of these chances is independent of the existence of cognizers. But\nit is only because we are not merely cognizers but physically situated\nagents that we have needed to develop a concept of chance tailored to our\nneeds as informationally deprived agents. Quantum chance admirably meets\nthose needs: an omniscient God could describe and understand the physical\nworld without it.\n\nWhile they are neither physical entities nor physical magnitudes, quantum\nchances are objective in a different sense. They supply an objective\nprescription for the credences of an agent in any physical situation. Anyone\nwho accepts quantum mechanics is committed to following that prescription.\n\n\\section{A view of quantum mechanics}\n\nAs I see it [2012], it is not the function of quantum states, observables,\nprobabilities or the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation to represent or describe the\ncondition or behavior of a physical system to which they are associated.\nThese elements function in other ways when a quantum model is applied in\npredicting or explaining physical phenomena such as non-localized\ncorrelations. Assignment of a quantum state may be viewed as merely the\nfirst step in a procedure that licenses a user of quantum mechanics to\nexpress claims about physical systems in descriptive language and then\nwarrants that user in adopting appropriate epistemic attitudes toward some\nof these claims. The language in which such claims are expressed is not the\nlanguage of quantum states or operators, and the claims are not about\nprobabilities or measurement results: they are about the values of physical\nmagnitudes, and I'll refer to them as \\textit{magnitude claims}. Magnitude\nclaims were made by physicists and others before the development of quantum\nmechanics and continue to be made, some in the same terms, others in terms\nnewly introduced as part of some scientific advance. But even though quantum\nmechanics represents an enormous scientific advance, claims about quantum\nstates, operators and probability distributions are not magnitude claims.\n\n\\qquad The quantum state has two roles. One is in the algorithm provided by\nthe Born Rule for assigning probabilities to significant claims of the form $\nM_{\\Delta }(s)$ : The value of $M$ on $s$ lies in $\\Delta $, where $M$ is a\nphysical magnitude, $s$ is a physical system and $\\Delta $ is a Borel set of\nreal numbers. In what follows, I will call a descriptive claim of the form $\nM_{\\Delta }(s)$ a\\textit{\\ canonical magnitude claim}. For two such claims\nthe formal algorithm may be stated as follows:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 23621, "prevtext": "\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation*}\nCh_{q}(e_{A})=Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A}|V_{B})\\equiv \\frac{Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(V_{A},V_{B})}{Pr_{b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{B})}=\\frac{\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\cos ^{2}\\angle ab}{\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n}=\\cos ^{2}\\angle ab\n\\end{equation*}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Ch_{q}(e_{A})=Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi^{+}}(V_{A}|V_{B})\\equiv\\frac{Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi^{+}}(%&#10;V_{A},V_{B})}{Pr_{b}^{\\Phi^{+}}(V_{B})}=\\frac{\\par&#10;\\par&#10;{\\frac{1}{2}}\\par&#10;\\cos%&#10;^{2}\\angle ab}{\\par&#10;\\par&#10;{\\frac{1}{2}}\\par&#10;}=\\cos^{2}\\angle ab\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>q</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>P</mi><msubsup><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></msubsup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2261</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>r</mi><mi>b</mi><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo>+</mo></msup></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msup><mi>cos</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2220</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mfrac><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>cos</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2220</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00106.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nHere $\\rho $ represents a quantum state as a density operator on a Hilbert\nspace $\\mathcal{H}_{s}$ and $\\hat{P}^{M}[\\Delta ]$ is the value for $\\Delta $\nof the projection-valued measure defined by the unique self-adjoint operator\non $\\mathcal{H}_{s}$ corresponding to $M$.\n\n\\qquad But the significance of a claim like $M_{\\Delta }(s)$ varies with the\ncircumstances to which it relates. Accordingly, a quantum state plays a\nsecond role by modulating the content of $M_{\\Delta }(s)$ or any other\nmagnitude claim by modifying its inferential relations to other claims.\nBecause I believe the nature of this modulation of content renders\ninappropriate the metaphor of magnitudes corresponding to elements of\nreality, I recommend against thinking of magnitudes that figure in canonical\nor other magnitude claims as beables, even though many such magnitude claims\nare true. But if one insists on calling magnitudes that figure in magnitude\nclaims beables, these magnitudes are not beables introduced by quantum\nmechanics---they are at most beables recognized in its applications.\n\\footnote{\nCompare Bell [2004, p. 55].}\n\n\\qquad The quantum state is not a beable in this view. Indeed, since none of\nthe distinctively quantum elements of a quantum model qualifies as a beable\nintroduced by the theory, quantum mechanics has no beables of its own.\nViewed this way, a quantum state does not describe or represent some new\nelement of physical reality.\\footnote{\nCompare Bell [2004, p. 53]: \"...this does not bother us if we do not grant\nbeable status to the wave-function.\"} But nor is it the quantum state's role\nto describe or represent the epistemic state of any actual agent. A quantum\nstate assignment is objectively true (or false): in that deflationary sense\na quantum state is objectively real. But its function is not to say what the\nworld is like but to help an agent applying quantum mechanics to predict and\nexplain what happens in it. It is physical conditions in the world that make\na quantum state assignment true (or false). True quantum state assignments\nare backed by true magnitude claims, though some of these are typically\nabout physical systems other than that to which the state is assigned.\n\n\\qquad Any application of quantum mechanics involves claims describing a\nphysical situation. While it is considered appropriate to make claims about\nwhere individual particles are detected contributing to the interference\npattern in a contemporary interference experiment, claims about through\nwhich slit each particle went are frequently alleged to be \\textquotedblleft\nmeaningless\\textquotedblright . In its second role the quantum state offers\nguidance on the inferential powers, and hence the content, of canonical\nmagnitude claims.\n\n\\qquad The key idea here is that even assuming unitary evolution of a joint\nquantum state of system and environment, delocalization of system state\ncoherence into the environment will typically render descriptive claims\nabout experimental outcomes and the condition of apparatus and other\nmacroscopic objects appropriate by endowing these claims with enough content\nto license an agent to adopt epistemic attitudes toward them, and in\nparticular to apply the Born Rule. But an application of quantum mechanics\nto determine whether this is so will not require referring to any system as\n\\textquotedblleft macroscopic\\textquotedblright , as an \\textquotedblleft\napparatus\\textquotedblright\\ or as an \\textquotedblleft\nenvironment\\textquotedblright . All that counts is how a quantum state of a\nsuper-system evolves in a model, given a Hamiltonian associated with an\ninteraction between the system of interest and the rest of that super-system.\n\n\\qquad It is important to note that since the formulation of the Born Rule\nnow involves no explicit or implicit reference to \\textquotedblleft\nmeasurement\\textquotedblright , Bell's ([2004, pp. 213-31]) strictures\nagainst the presence of the term `measurement' in a precise formulation of\nquantum mechanics are met. None of the other proscribed terms `classical',\n`macroscopic', `irreversible', or `information' appears in its stead.\n\n\\qquad Since an agent's assignment of a quantum state does not serve to\nrepresent a system's properties, her reassignment of a \\textquotedblleft\ncollapsed\\textquotedblright\\ state on gaining new information represents no\nchange in that system's properties. That is why collapse is not a physical\nprocess, in this view of quantum mechanics. Nor does the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation express a fundamental physical law: to assign a quantum state to a\nsystem is not to represent its dynamical properties. A formulation of\nquantum mechanics has no need to include a statement distinguishing the\ncircumstances in which physical processes of Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution and\n\\textquotedblleft collapse\\textquotedblright\\ occur. An agent can use\nquantum mechanics to track changes of the dynamical properties of a system\nby noting what magnitude claims are significant and true of it at various\ntimes. But quantum mechanics itself does not imply any such claim, even when\nan agent would be correct to assign a system a quantum state, appropriately\napply the Born Rule, and conclude that the claim has probability 1.\n\n\\qquad Quantum states are relational on this interpretation. When agents\n(actually or merely hypothetically) occupy relevantly different physical\nsituations they should assign different quantum states to one and the same\nsystem, even though these different quantum state assignments are equally\ncorrect. The primary function of Born probabilities is to offer a physically\nsituated agent authoritative advice on how to apportion degrees of belief\nconcerning contentful canonical magnitude claims that the agent is not\ncurrently in a position to check. That is why the Born rule should be\napplied by differently situated agents to assign different chances to a\nsingle canonical magnitude claim $M_{\\Delta }(s)$ about a system $s$ in a\ngiven situation. These different chance assignments will then be equally\nobjective and equally correct.\n\n\\qquad The physical situation of a (hypothetical or actual) agent will\nchange with (local) time. The agent may come to be in a position to check\nthe truth-values of previously inaccessible magnitude claims, some of which\nmay be taken truly to describe outcomes of measurements. If a quantum state\nis to continue to provide the agent with good guidance concerning still\ninaccessible magnitude claims, it must be updated to reflect these newly\naccessible truths. The required alteration in the quantum state is not a\nphysical process involving the system, in conflict with Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nevolution. What has changed is just the physical relation of the agent to\nevents whose occurrence is described by true magnitude claims. This is not\nrepresented by a discontinuous change in the quantum state of some model: it\ncorresponds to adoption of a \\textit{new} quantum model that incorporates\nadditional information, newly accessible to the user of quantum mechanics.\n\n\\qquad The preceding paragraphs contained a lot of talk of agents. To\nforestall misunderstandings, I emphasize that quantum mechanics is not about\nagents or their states of knowledge or belief: A precise formulation of\nquantum mechanics will not speak of such things in its models any more than\nit will speak of agents' measuring, observing or preparing activities. If\nquantum mechanics is about anything it is about the quantum systems, states,\nobservables and probability measures that figure in its models. Quantum\nmechanics, like all scientific theories, was developed by (human) agents for\nthe use of agents (not necessarily human: while insisting that any agent be\nphysically situated, I direct further inquiry on the constitution of agents\nto cognitive scientists). Trivially, only an agent can apply a theory for\nwhatever purpose. So any account of a predictive, explanatory or other\napplication of quantum mechanics naturally involves talk of agents.\\pagebreak\n\n\\section{How to use quantum mechanics to explain non-localized correlations}\n\nIn his [1981] Bell argued that\n\n\\begin{quote}\ncertain particular correlations, realizable according to quantum mechanics,\nare locally inexplicable. They cannot be explained, that is to say, without\naction at a distance. [2004, pp. 151-2]\n\\end{quote}\n\nThe particular correlations to which Bell refers arise, for example, in the\nEPR-Bohm scenario in which pairs of spin \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n\"particles\" are prepared in a singlet spin state, then at widely separated\nlocations each element of a pair is passed through a Stern-Gerlach magnet\nand detected either in the upper or in the lower part of a screen. By\ncalling them realizable rather than realized he acknowledged the\nexperimental difficulties associated with actually producing statistics\nsupporting them in the laboratory (or elsewhere). Enormous improvements in\nexperimental technique since 1981 have overcome most of the difficulties\nassociated with performing a \\textquotedblleft\nloophole-free\\textquotedblright\\ test of CHSH or other so-called Bell\ninequalities and at the same time provided very strong statistical evidence\nfor quantum mechanical predictions in analogous experiments. Since the\nimprovements have been most dramatic for experiments involving polarization\nmeasurements on entangled photons, it is appropriate to refer back to the\nexperimental scenario discussed by Bell in 1990 ([2004, pp. 232-248]).\n\n\\qquad Suppose photon pairs are prepared at a central source in the\nentangled polarization state $\\Phi ^{+}=1/\\sqrt{2}(|HH\\rangle +|VV\\rangle )$\n, and the photons in a pair are both subsequently detected in coincidence at\ntwo widely separated locations after each has passed through a polarizing\nbeam splitter (PBS) with axis set at $a,b$ respectively. If a photon is\ndetected with polarization parallel to this axis, a macroscopic record\nsignifies \\textquotedblleft yes\\textquotedblright : if it is detected with\npolarization perpendicular to this axis, the record signifies\n\\textquotedblleft no\\textquotedblright . Let the record \\textquotedblleft\nyes\\textquotedblright\\ at one location be the event of a magnitude $A$\ntaking on value $+1$, \\textquotedblleft no\\textquotedblright\\ the event of $\nA $ taking on value $-1$, and similarly for $B$ at the other location. Let $\na $ be a locally generated signal that quickly sets the axis of the PBS on\nthe $A $ side to an angle $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$ from some standard direction, and similarly for $b$ on the $B$ side.\nAssume this is done so that each of $a$ and $A$'s taking on a value is\nspace-like separated from each of $b$ and $B$'s taking on a value. In this\nscenario quantum mechanics predicts that, for $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n=0\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n,a^{\\prime }\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n=45\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n,b\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n=22\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n,b^{\\prime }\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n=-22\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 42287, "prevtext": "\nNote that the reference class used in calculating $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ is\nnarrower: it is further restricted by specification of the outcome as of\ntype $V_{B}$ in region $\\mathbf{2}$.\n\nAny agent who accepts quantum theory and is (momentarily) located at\nspace-time point $x$ should match credence in $e_{A}$ to $Ch_{x}(e_{A})$\nbecause it is precisely the role of chance to reflect the epistemic bearing\nof all information accessible at $x$ on facts not so accessible, and to\naccept quantum theory is to treat it as an\\ expert when assessing the\nchances.

Now\nin ordinary quantum mechanics there just \\textit{is} nothing but the\nwavefunction for calculating probabilities. There is then no question of\nmaking the result on one side redundant on the other by more fully\nspecifying events in some space-time region $\\mathbf{3}$. We have a\nviolation of local causality.\"\n\\end{quote}\n\n\\qquad It is true that (\\ref{Factorizability}) and (\\ref{FactorizabilitySU})\nfail here, since $Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A}|V_{B})=1$, $Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(H_{A}|V_{B})=0$, while $Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(A)=Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(B)=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$. But does that constitute a violation of local causality? (LC) and (LC$\n_{SU}$) are both conditions straightforwardly applicable to a theory whose\ngeneral probabilities yield a \\textit{unique} chance for each possible\noutcome in $\\mathbf{1}$ prior to its occurrence. In the case of quantum\ntheory, however, the general Born rule probabilities yield \\textit{multiple}\nchances for each possible outcome in $\\mathbf{1}$, each at the same time\\\n(in the laboratory frame): $Ch_{p}(e_{A})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$, but $Ch_{q}(e_{A})=1$ (assuming the outcome in $\\mathbf{2}$ is of type $\nV_{B}$). When (LC) speaks of \\textquotedblleft \\textit{the} probabilities\nattached to [$e_{A},\\bar{e}_{A}$] in a space-time region $\\mathbf{1}$ being\nunaltered by specification of [$V_{B}$] in a space-like separated region $\n\\mathbf{2}$\\textquotedblright\\ (my italics), which probabilities are these?\n\n\\qquad Since the connection to (IP)'s motivating talk of `cause' and\n`effect' is provided by the thought that a cause alters the chance of its\neffect, (LC) is motivated only if applied to the \\textit{chances} of $e_{A},\n\\bar{e}_{A}$ in region $\\mathbf{1}$. But $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$ is \\textit{not}\naltered by specification of $V_{B}$ in space-like separated region $\\mathbf{2\n}$: its value depends only on what happens in the backward light cone of $\n\\mathbf{1}$, in conformity\\ to its role in prescribing $Cr_{p}(e_{A})$.$\\ $\nOf course $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ does depend on the outcome in $\\mathbf{2}$. If it\ndid not, it could not fulfill its constitutive role of prescribing $\nCr_{q}(e_{A}/I_{q})$ no matter what information $I_{q}$ provides about the\ncontents of $q$'s past light cone. It follows that $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ is not\naltered but \\textit{specified} by specification of the result in $\\mathbf{2}$\n.\n\n\\qquad Only for a hypothetical agent whose world-line has entered the future\nlight cone of $\\mathbf{2}$ at $q$ is it true that specification of the\nresult in $\\mathbf{2}$\\ permits a 100\\% confident prediction of the\npreviously totally uncertain result on the other side. A hypothetical agent\nat $p$ is not in\\ a position to make a 100\\% confident prediction: for such\nan agent the result in $\\mathbf{1}$ remains totally uncertain: what happens\nin $\\mathbf{2}$ makes no difference to what (s)he should believe, since\nregion $\\mathbf{2}$ is outside the backward light cone of $p$. That is why\nit is $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$, not $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$, that says what is certain at $p$\n. Newtonian absolute time fostered the illusion of the occurrence of future\nevents becoming certain for everyone at the same time---when they occur if\nnot sooner. Relativity requires certainty, like chance, to be relativized to\nspace-time points---idealized locations of hypothetical knowers.\n\n\\qquad So does ordinary quantum mechanics violate local causality? If\n\\textquotedblleft the probabilities\\textquotedblright\\ (LC) speaks of are $\nPr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A}),$ $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(H_{A})$, and the\ncondition that these be unaltered is understood to be that $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(V_{A})=Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A}|B),$ $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(H_{A})=Pr_{a,a}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(H_{A}|B)$, then ordinary quantum mechanics\nviolates (LC). But if this is all (LC) means, then it is not motivated by\n(IP) and its violation does not imply that the quantum world is non-local in\nthat there are superluminal causal relations between distant events. For\n(LC) to be motivated by causal considerations such as (IP),\n\\textquotedblleft the probabilities\\textquotedblright\\ (LC) speaks of must\nbe understood to be chances, including $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$ and $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$.\nBut neither of these would be altered by the specification of the outcome [$\nV_{B}$] in a space-like separated region, so local causality would then not\nbe violated. Although it remains unclear exactly how (LC) (or (LC$_{SU}$))\nis supposed to be applied to quantum mechanics, one way of applying it is\nunmotivated by (IP), while if it is applied in another way quantum mechanics\ndoes \\textit{not} violate this local causality condition.\n\n\\section{Chance and Causation}\n\nSuppose in the EPR-Bohm scenario that the outcome in region $\\mathbf{2}$ had\nbeen of type $H_{B}$ instead of $V_{B}$: then $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would have\nbeen 0 instead of 1. Suppose that the polarization axis for the measurement\nin region $\\mathbf{2}$ had been rotated through $60\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$: then $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would have been \n\n\n$\\frac14$\n\nor \n\n\n$\\frac34$\n\n, depending on the outcome in region $\\mathbf{2}$. Or suppose that no\npolarization measurement had been performed in region $\\mathbf{2}$: then $\nCh_{q}(e_{A})$ would have been \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n. This shows that $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ depends counterfactually on the\npolarization measurement in $\\mathbf{2}$ and also on its outcome. Another\nway to understand talk of \\textquotedblleft alteration\\textquotedblright\\ of\n\\textquotedblleft the\\textquotedblright\\ probability of an event of type $\nV_{A}$ is as the difference between the actual value of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ and\nwhat its value would have been had the polarization measurement in $\\mathbf{2\n}$ or its outcome been different. Don't such counterfactual\n\\textquotedblleft alterations\\textquotedblright\\ in $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$\\ amount\nto \\textit{causal} dependence between space-like separated events, in\nviolation of (IP)? There are several reasons why they do not.\n\nThe first reason is that while $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would be different in each of\nthese counterfactual scenarios, in none of them would $Ch_{p}(e_{A})$ differ\nfrom \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n, so the \"local\" chance of $e_{A}$ is insensitive to all such counterfactual\nvariations in what happens in $\\mathbf{2}$. If one wishes to infer causal\nfrom counterfactual dependence of \\textquotedblleft the\\textquotedblright\\\nchance of a result in $\\mathbf{1}$ on what happens in $\\mathbf{2}$, then\nonly one of two relevant candidates for \\textquotedblleft\nthe\\textquotedblright\\ chance displays such counterfactual dependence. For\nthose who think of chance as itself a kind of indeterministic cause---a\nlocalized physical propensity whose actualization may produce an effect---$\nCh_{p}(e_{A})$ seems better qualified for\\ the title of \\textquotedblleft\nthe\\textquotedblright\\ chance of $e_{A}$\\ than $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$.\n\nThe role of chance in decision provides the second reason. Just as the\nchance of $e$ tells you everything you need to\\ know to figure out how\nstrongly to believe $e$, the causal dependence of $e$ on $d$ tells you\neverything you need to know about $e$ and $d$ when deciding whether to do $d$\n(assuming you are not indifferent about $e$). As Huw Price [2012] put it,\n\\textquotedblleft causal dependence should be regarded as an analyst-expert\nabout the conditional credences required by an evidential decision\nmaker\\textquotedblright .\n\nConsider the situation of a hypothetical agent Bob at $p^{\\prime }$ deciding\nwhether to act by affecting what happens in $\\mathbf{2}$ to try to get\noutcome $e_{A}$ in $\\mathbf{1}$. Bob can choose not to measure anything, or\nhe can choose to measure polarization with respect to any axis $b$. If he\nwere to measure nothing, $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would be \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n. If he were to measure polarization with respect to the same axis as Alice,\nthen $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ would be either 0 or 1, with an equal chance (at his\nmomentary location $p^{\\prime }$) of either outcome. Since he\\ can neither\nknow nor affect which of these chances it will be, he must base his decision\non his best estimate of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ in accordance with Ismael's [2008]\nIgnorance Principle:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\textquotedblleft Where you're not sure about the chances, form a mixture of\nthe chances assigned by different theories of chance with weights determined\nby your relative confidence in those theories.\\textquotedblright\n\\end{quote}\n\nFollowing this principle, Bob should assign $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$ the estimated\nvalue $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.0+\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.1=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$, and base his decision on that. Since measuring polarization with respect\nto the same axis as Alice would not raise his estimated chance of securing\noutcome $e_{A}$ in $\\mathbf{1}$, he should eliminate this option \\textit{\nwhether or not he could execute it}. His estimated value of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$\nwere he to measure polarization with respect to an axis rotated $60\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$ from Alice's is also \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n($\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.\n\n\n{\\frac14}\n\n+\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n.\n\n\n{\\frac34}\n\n=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$). Similarly for any other angle. This essentially recapitulates part of\nthe content of the no-signalling theorems, going back to Eberhard [1978].\nBell [2004, pp. 237-8] shows why manipulation of external fields at $\np^{\\prime }$ or in $\\mathbf{2}$ would also fail to alter Bob's estimated\nvalue of $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$.\n\nBut what if Bob had simply arranged for the measurement in $\\mathbf{2}$ to\nhave had the different \\textit{outcome} $\\bar{e}_{B}$? Then $Ch_{q}(e_{A})$\nwould have been 0 instead of 1. No-one who accepts quantum mechanics can\ncountenance this counterfactual scenario. The Born rule implies that $\nPr_{b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(H_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$, and anyone who accepts quantum mechanics accepts the implication that $\nCh_{p^{\\prime }}(\\bar{e}_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$. So anyone who accepts quantum mechanics will have credence $Cr_{p^{\\prime\n}}(\\bar{e}_{B}/I_{p^{\\prime }})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$ no matter what he takes to happen in the backward light cone of $p^{\\prime\n}$ (as specified by $I_{p^{\\prime }}$).\\footnote{\nA unitary evolution $\\Phi ^{+}\\Rightarrow \\Xi ^{+}$\\ corresponding to a \n\\textit{local} interaction there would still yield $Pr_{b}^{\\Xi ^{+}}(H_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$.} If he accepts quantum mechanics, Bob will conclude that there is nothing\nit makes sense to contemplate doing to alter his estimate of $Ch_{p^{\\prime\n}}(\\bar{e}_{B})$, and so there \\ is no conceivable counterfactual scenario\nin which one in Bob's position arranges for the measurement in $\\mathbf{2}$\nto have had the different outcome $\\bar{e}_{B}$. In general, there is causal\ndependence between events in $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ only if it makes\nsense to speak of an intervention in one of these regions that would affect\na hypothetical agent's estimated chance of what happens in the other. Anyone\nwho accepts quantum mechanics should deny that makes sense.\n\nPerhaps the most basic reason why counterfactual dependencies between\nhappenings in region $\\mathbf{2}$ and the chance(s) of $e_{A}$ are no sign\nof causal dependence is that chances are not beables, and are incapable of\nentering into causal relations. That Bell thought they behaved like beables\nis suggested by the [1975] paper in which he introduced local causality as a\nnatural generalization of local determinism:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\textquotedblleft In Maxwell's theory, the fields in any space-time region $\n\\mathbf{1}$ are determined by those in any space region $V$, at some time $t$\n, which fully closes the backward light cone of $\\mathbf{1}$. Because the\nregion $V$ is limited, localized, we will say the theory exhibits \\textit{\nlocal determinism}. We would like to form some no[ta]tion of \\textit{local\ncausality} in theories which are not deterministic, in which the\ncorrelations prescribed by the theory, for the beables, are\nweaker.\\textquotedblright\\ [2004, p. 53]\n\\end{quote}\n\nIt seems Bell thought the chances prescribed by a theory that is not\ndeterministic were analogous to the beables of Maxwell's electromagnetism,\nso that while local determinism (locally) specified the local[ized] beables\n(e.g. fields), local causality should (locally) specify the local[ized] \n\\textit{chances} of beables, where those chances (like local beables) are\nthemselves localized physical magnitudes.\n\nOthers have joined Bell in this view of chances as localized physical\nmagnitudes. But quantum mechanics teaches us that chances are \\textit{not}\nlocalized physical propensities whose actualization may produce an effect.\nMaudlin says what he means by calling probabilities objective:\n\n\\begin{quote}\n\\textquotedblleft ...there could be probabilities that arise from\nfundamental physics, probabilities that attach to actual or possible events\nin virtue solely of their physical description and independent of the\nexistence of cognizers. These are what I mean by \\textit{objective\nprobabilities}.\\textquotedblright\\ (Beisbart and Hartmann eds., [2011, p.\n294])\n\\end{quote}\n\nAlthough quantum chances do attach to actual or possible events, they are\nnot objective in this sense. As we saw, the chance of outcome $e_{A}$ does\nnot attach to it in virtue solely of its physical description: the \\textit{\nchances} of $e_{A}$ attach also in virtue of its space-time relations to\ndifferent space-time locations. Each such location offers the epistemic\nperspective of a situated agent, even in a world with no such agents. The\nexistence of these chances is independent of the existence of cognizers. But\nit is only because we are not merely cognizers but physically situated\nagents that we have needed to develop a concept of chance tailored to our\nneeds as informationally deprived agents. Quantum chance admirably meets\nthose needs: an omniscient God could describe and understand the physical\nworld without it.\n\nWhile they are neither physical entities nor physical magnitudes, quantum\nchances are objective in a different sense. They supply an objective\nprescription for the credences of an agent in any physical situation. Anyone\nwho accepts quantum mechanics is committed to following that prescription.\n\n\\section{A view of quantum mechanics}\n\nAs I see it [2012], it is not the function of quantum states, observables,\nprobabilities or the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation to represent or describe the\ncondition or behavior of a physical system to which they are associated.\nThese elements function in other ways when a quantum model is applied in\npredicting or explaining physical phenomena such as non-localized\ncorrelations. Assignment of a quantum state may be viewed as merely the\nfirst step in a procedure that licenses a user of quantum mechanics to\nexpress claims about physical systems in descriptive language and then\nwarrants that user in adopting appropriate epistemic attitudes toward some\nof these claims. The language in which such claims are expressed is not the\nlanguage of quantum states or operators, and the claims are not about\nprobabilities or measurement results: they are about the values of physical\nmagnitudes, and I'll refer to them as \\textit{magnitude claims}. Magnitude\nclaims were made by physicists and others before the development of quantum\nmechanics and continue to be made, some in the same terms, others in terms\nnewly introduced as part of some scientific advance. But even though quantum\nmechanics represents an enormous scientific advance, claims about quantum\nstates, operators and probability distributions are not magnitude claims.\n\n\\qquad The quantum state has two roles. One is in the algorithm provided by\nthe Born Rule for assigning probabilities to significant claims of the form $\nM_{\\Delta }(s)$ : The value of $M$ on $s$ lies in $\\Delta $, where $M$ is a\nphysical magnitude, $s$ is a physical system and $\\Delta $ is a Borel set of\nreal numbers. In what follows, I will call a descriptive claim of the form $\nM_{\\Delta }(s)$ a\\textit{\\ canonical magnitude claim}. For two such claims\nthe formal algorithm may be stated as follows:\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Pr (M_{\\Delta }(s),N_{\\Gamma }(s))=Tr(\\rho \\hat{P}^{M}[\\Delta ].\\hat{P}\n^{N}[\\Gamma ])  \\tag{Born Rule}  \\label{Born}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Pr(M_{\\Delta}(s),N_{\\Gamma}(s))=Tr(\\rho\\hat{P}^{M}[\\Delta].\\hat{P}^{N}[\\Gamma%&#10;]){}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>Pr</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>r</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c1</mi><msup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>M</mi></msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>.</mo><msup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>N</mi></msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00106.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere, for example, $E(a,b)\\equiv\n\\Pr_{a,b}(+1,+1)+\\Pr_{a,b}(-1,-1)-\\Pr_{a,b}(+1,-1)-\\Pr_{a,b}(-1,+1)$. This\nis in violation of the CHSH inequality\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 53328, "prevtext": "\n\nHere $\\rho $ represents a quantum state as a density operator on a Hilbert\nspace $\\mathcal{H}_{s}$ and $\\hat{P}^{M}[\\Delta ]$ is the value for $\\Delta $\nof the projection-valued measure defined by the unique self-adjoint operator\non $\\mathcal{H}_{s}$ corresponding to $M$.\n\n\\qquad But the significance of a claim like $M_{\\Delta }(s)$ varies with the\ncircumstances to which it relates. Accordingly, a quantum state plays a\nsecond role by modulating the content of $M_{\\Delta }(s)$ or any other\nmagnitude claim by modifying its inferential relations to other claims.\nBecause I believe the nature of this modulation of content renders\ninappropriate the metaphor of magnitudes corresponding to elements of\nreality, I recommend against thinking of magnitudes that figure in canonical\nor other magnitude claims as beables, even though many such magnitude claims\nare true. But if one insists on calling magnitudes that figure in magnitude\nclaims beables, these magnitudes are not beables introduced by quantum\nmechanics---they are at most beables recognized in its applications.\n\\footnote{\nCompare Bell [2004, p. 55].}\n\n\\qquad The quantum state is not a beable in this view. Indeed, since none of\nthe distinctively quantum elements of a quantum model qualifies as a beable\nintroduced by the theory, quantum mechanics has no beables of its own.\nViewed this way, a quantum state does not describe or represent some new\nelement of physical reality.\\footnote{\nCompare Bell [2004, p. 53]: \"...this does not bother us if we do not grant\nbeable status to the wave-function.\"} But nor is it the quantum state's role\nto describe or represent the epistemic state of any actual agent. A quantum\nstate assignment is objectively true (or false): in that deflationary sense\na quantum state is objectively real. But its function is not to say what the\nworld is like but to help an agent applying quantum mechanics to predict and\nexplain what happens in it. It is physical conditions in the world that make\na quantum state assignment true (or false). True quantum state assignments\nare backed by true magnitude claims, though some of these are typically\nabout physical systems other than that to which the state is assigned.\n\n\\qquad Any application of quantum mechanics involves claims describing a\nphysical situation. While it is considered appropriate to make claims about\nwhere individual particles are detected contributing to the interference\npattern in a contemporary interference experiment, claims about through\nwhich slit each particle went are frequently alleged to be \\textquotedblleft\nmeaningless\\textquotedblright . In its second role the quantum state offers\nguidance on the inferential powers, and hence the content, of canonical\nmagnitude claims.\n\n\\qquad The key idea here is that even assuming unitary evolution of a joint\nquantum state of system and environment, delocalization of system state\ncoherence into the environment will typically render descriptive claims\nabout experimental outcomes and the condition of apparatus and other\nmacroscopic objects appropriate by endowing these claims with enough content\nto license an agent to adopt epistemic attitudes toward them, and in\nparticular to apply the Born Rule. But an application of quantum mechanics\nto determine whether this is so will not require referring to any system as\n\\textquotedblleft macroscopic\\textquotedblright , as an \\textquotedblleft\napparatus\\textquotedblright\\ or as an \\textquotedblleft\nenvironment\\textquotedblright . All that counts is how a quantum state of a\nsuper-system evolves in a model, given a Hamiltonian associated with an\ninteraction between the system of interest and the rest of that super-system.\n\n\\qquad It is important to note that since the formulation of the Born Rule\nnow involves no explicit or implicit reference to \\textquotedblleft\nmeasurement\\textquotedblright , Bell's ([2004, pp. 213-31]) strictures\nagainst the presence of the term `measurement' in a precise formulation of\nquantum mechanics are met. None of the other proscribed terms `classical',\n`macroscopic', `irreversible', or `information' appears in its stead.\n\n\\qquad Since an agent's assignment of a quantum state does not serve to\nrepresent a system's properties, her reassignment of a \\textquotedblleft\ncollapsed\\textquotedblright\\ state on gaining new information represents no\nchange in that system's properties. That is why collapse is not a physical\nprocess, in this view of quantum mechanics. Nor does the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation express a fundamental physical law: to assign a quantum state to a\nsystem is not to represent its dynamical properties. A formulation of\nquantum mechanics has no need to include a statement distinguishing the\ncircumstances in which physical processes of Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution and\n\\textquotedblleft collapse\\textquotedblright\\ occur. An agent can use\nquantum mechanics to track changes of the dynamical properties of a system\nby noting what magnitude claims are significant and true of it at various\ntimes. But quantum mechanics itself does not imply any such claim, even when\nan agent would be correct to assign a system a quantum state, appropriately\napply the Born Rule, and conclude that the claim has probability 1.\n\n\\qquad Quantum states are relational on this interpretation. When agents\n(actually or merely hypothetically) occupy relevantly different physical\nsituations they should assign different quantum states to one and the same\nsystem, even though these different quantum state assignments are equally\ncorrect. The primary function of Born probabilities is to offer a physically\nsituated agent authoritative advice on how to apportion degrees of belief\nconcerning contentful canonical magnitude claims that the agent is not\ncurrently in a position to check. That is why the Born rule should be\napplied by differently situated agents to assign different chances to a\nsingle canonical magnitude claim $M_{\\Delta }(s)$ about a system $s$ in a\ngiven situation. These different chance assignments will then be equally\nobjective and equally correct.\n\n\\qquad The physical situation of a (hypothetical or actual) agent will\nchange with (local) time. The agent may come to be in a position to check\nthe truth-values of previously inaccessible magnitude claims, some of which\nmay be taken truly to describe outcomes of measurements. If a quantum state\nis to continue to provide the agent with good guidance concerning still\ninaccessible magnitude claims, it must be updated to reflect these newly\naccessible truths. The required alteration in the quantum state is not a\nphysical process involving the system, in conflict with Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nevolution. What has changed is just the physical relation of the agent to\nevents whose occurrence is described by true magnitude claims. This is not\nrepresented by a discontinuous change in the quantum state of some model: it\ncorresponds to adoption of a \\textit{new} quantum model that incorporates\nadditional information, newly accessible to the user of quantum mechanics.\n\n\\qquad The preceding paragraphs contained a lot of talk of agents. To\nforestall misunderstandings, I emphasize that quantum mechanics is not about\nagents or their states of knowledge or belief: A precise formulation of\nquantum mechanics will not speak of such things in its models any more than\nit will speak of agents' measuring, observing or preparing activities. If\nquantum mechanics is about anything it is about the quantum systems, states,\nobservables and probability measures that figure in its models. Quantum\nmechanics, like all scientific theories, was developed by (human) agents for\nthe use of agents (not necessarily human: while insisting that any agent be\nphysically situated, I direct further inquiry on the constitution of agents\nto cognitive scientists). Trivially, only an agent can apply a theory for\nwhatever purpose. So any account of a predictive, explanatory or other\napplication of quantum mechanics naturally involves talk of agents.\\pagebreak\n\n\\section{How to use quantum mechanics to explain non-localized correlations}\n\nIn his [1981] Bell argued that\n\n\\begin{quote}\ncertain particular correlations, realizable according to quantum mechanics,\nare locally inexplicable. They cannot be explained, that is to say, without\naction at a distance. [2004, pp. 151-2]\n\\end{quote}\n\nThe particular correlations to which Bell refers arise, for example, in the\nEPR-Bohm scenario in which pairs of spin \n\n\n$\\frac12$\n\n\"particles\" are prepared in a singlet spin state, then at widely separated\nlocations each element of a pair is passed through a Stern-Gerlach magnet\nand detected either in the upper or in the lower part of a screen. By\ncalling them realizable rather than realized he acknowledged the\nexperimental difficulties associated with actually producing statistics\nsupporting them in the laboratory (or elsewhere). Enormous improvements in\nexperimental technique since 1981 have overcome most of the difficulties\nassociated with performing a \\textquotedblleft\nloophole-free\\textquotedblright\\ test of CHSH or other so-called Bell\ninequalities and at the same time provided very strong statistical evidence\nfor quantum mechanical predictions in analogous experiments. Since the\nimprovements have been most dramatic for experiments involving polarization\nmeasurements on entangled photons, it is appropriate to refer back to the\nexperimental scenario discussed by Bell in 1990 ([2004, pp. 232-248]).\n\n\\qquad Suppose photon pairs are prepared at a central source in the\nentangled polarization state $\\Phi ^{+}=1/\\sqrt{2}(|HH\\rangle +|VV\\rangle )$\n, and the photons in a pair are both subsequently detected in coincidence at\ntwo widely separated locations after each has passed through a polarizing\nbeam splitter (PBS) with axis set at $a,b$ respectively. If a photon is\ndetected with polarization parallel to this axis, a macroscopic record\nsignifies \\textquotedblleft yes\\textquotedblright : if it is detected with\npolarization perpendicular to this axis, the record signifies\n\\textquotedblleft no\\textquotedblright .

Bell claims these correlations\nare realizable according to quantum mechanics but that they cannot be\nexplained without action at a distance. While it is generally acknowledged\nthat quantum mechanics successfully predicts Bell's particular correlations,\ndemonstrating this will illustrate the present view of quantum mechanics. To\ndecide whether it also explains them we need to ask what more is required of\nan explanation.\n\n\\qquad What we take to be a satisfactory explanation has changed during the\ndevelopment of physics, and we may confidently expect such change to\ncontinue. One who accepts quantum mechanics is able to offer a novel kind of\nexplanation. Nevertheless, explanations of phenomena using quantum mechanics\nmay be seen to meet two very general conditions met by many, if not all,\ngood explanations in physics.\n\n(i) They show that the phenomenon to be explained was to be expected, and\n\n(ii) they say what it depends on.\\newline\nQuantum mechanics enables us to give explanations meeting both conditions.\n\n\\qquad Meeting the first condition is straightforward. Anyone accepting\nquantum mechanics can use the \\ref{Born} applied to state $\\Phi ^{+}$ to\ncalculate joint probabilities such as $\\Pr_{a,b}(A,B)$ and go on to derive (\n\\ref{CHSH violation}). So for anyone who accepts quantum mechanics,\nviolation of the CHSH inequalities is to be expected. But it is worth\nshowing in more detail how quantum mechanics can be applied to derive (\\ref\n{CHSH violation}) because this will help to exhibit the relational nature of\nquantum states and probabilities while making it clear that a precise\nformulation of quantum mechanics need not use the word `measurement' or any\nother term on Bell's list of proscribed words [2004, p. 215].\\FRAME{fhF}{\n3.5916in}{3.039in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\\special{language \"Scientific Word\";type\n\"GRAPHIC\";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display \"USEDEF\";valid_file \"T\";width\n3.5916in;height 3.039in;depth 0pt;original-width 5.6611in;original-height\n4.7841in;cropleft \"0\";croptop \"1\";cropright \"1\";cropbottom \"0\";tempfilename\n'NDR1RI08.wmf';tempfile-properties \"XPR\";}}\n\n\\qquad Figure 4 is a space-time diagram depicting space-like separated\npolarization measurements by Alice and Bob in regions 1,2 respectively on a\nphoton pair. Time is represented in the laboratory frame. At $t_{1}$ each\ntakes the polarization state of the $L-R$ photon pair to be $\\Phi ^{+}=1/\n\\sqrt{2}(|HH\\rangle +|VV\\rangle )$. What justifies this quantum state\nassignment is their knowledge of the conditions under which the photon pair\nwas produced---perhaps by parametric down-conversion of laser light by\npassage through a non-linear crystal. Such knowledge depends on information\nabout the physical systems involved in producing the pair. This state\nassignment is backed by significant magnitude claims about such systems---if\nanything counts as a claim about beables recognized by quantum mechanics,\nthese do. Then Alice measures polarization of photon $L$ along axis $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$, Bob measures polarization of photon $R$ along axis $b\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$. Decoherence at the photon detectors licenses both of them to treat the\nBorn rule measure corresponding to state assignment $\\Phi ^{+}$\\ as a\nprobability distribution over significant canonical magnitude claims about\nthe values of $A,B$.\n\n\\qquad At $t_{1}$ Alice and Bob should both assign state $\\Phi ^{+}$ and\napply the \\ref{Born}\\ to calculate the joint probability $\\Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(A,B)$ assigned to claims about the values of magnitudes $A,B$---claims\nthat we may, but need not, choose to describe as records of polarization\nmeasurements along both $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n,b\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$ axes---and hence the (well-defined) conditional probability $\n\\Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(A,B)/\\Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(B)=|\\langle A|B\\rangle\n|^{2} $. Each will then expect the observed non-localized correlations\nbetween the outcomes of polarization measurements in regions 1,2 when the\ndetectors are set along the $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n,b\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$ axes. They will expect analogous correlations as these axes are varied,\nand so they will expect (\\ref{CHSH violation})\\ (violating the CHSH\ninequality) in such a scenario.\n\n\\qquad At $t_{2}$, after recording polarization $V_{B}$ for $R$, Bob should\nassign pure state $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $L$ and use the Born Rule to calculate\nthe probabilities $\\Pr_{a}^{|V_{B}>}(A)=|\\langle A|V_{B}\\rangle |^{2}$ for\nAlice to record polarization of $L$ with respect to the $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$-axis. At $t_{2}$, Alice should assign state $\\hat{\\rho}=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\hat{1}$ to $L$, and use the Born Rule to calculate probability $\n\\Pr_{a}^{\\rho }(A)=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$ that she will record either polarization of $L$ with respect to the $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$-axis. In this way each forms expectations as to the outcome of Alice's\nmeasurement on the best information available to him or her at $t_{2}$.\nAlice's statistics of her outcomes in many repetitions of the experiment are\njust what her quantum state $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\hat{1}$ for $L$ led her to expect, thereby helping to explain her results.\nBob's statistics for Alice's outcomes (in many repetitions in which his\noutcome is $V_{B}$) are just what his quantum state $|V_{B}\\rangle $ for $L$\nled him to expect, thereby helping him to explain Alice's results.\n\n\\qquad There is no question as to which, if either, of the quantum states $\n|V_{B}\\rangle $, $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\hat{1}$ was the \\textit{real} state of Alice's photon at $t_{2}$. Neither\nof the different probabilities $|\\langle A|V_{B}\\rangle |^{2}$ or $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$ represents a unique physical propensity at $t_{2}$ of Alice's\noutcome---even though neither its chance at $p$ nor its chance at $q$ is\nsubjective. This discussion applies independent of the time-order in Alice's\nframe of the regions 1, 2 in Figure 1: had she been moving away from Bob\nfast enough, she would have represented 1 as earlier than 2.\n\n\\qquad It is widely acknowledged that one cannot explain a phenomenon merely\nby showing that it was to be expected in the circumstances. To repeat a\nhackneyed counterexample, the falling barometer does not explain the coming\nstorm even though it gives one reason to expect a storm in the\ncircumstances. As a joint effect of a common cause, a symptom does not\nexplain its other independent effects. But a system's being in a quantum\nstate at a time is not a symptom of causes specified by the true magnitude\nclaims that back it since it is not an event distinct from the\\ conditions\nthose claims describe. Each event figuring in Bell's particular correlations\nis truly described by a canonical magnitude claim. We may choose to describe\nsome, but not all, such events as an outcome of a quantum measurement on a\nsystem: the probabilities of many of those events depend counterfactually on\nthe particular entangled state assigned at $t_{1}$---if that state had been\ndifferent, so would these probabilities. But this dependence is not causal.\nIn quantum mechanics, neither states nor probabilities are the sorts of\nthings that can bear causal relations: in Bell's terminology, they are not\nbeables.\n\n\\qquad When relativized to the physical situation of an actual or\nhypothetical agent, a quantum state assignment is objectively true or\nfalse---which depends on the state of the world. More specifically, a\nquantum state assignment is made true by the true magnitude claims that back\nit. One true magnitude claim backing the assignment of $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $\nL $ at $q$ reports the outcome of Bob's polarization measurement in region 2\nof Figure 1: but there are others, since this would not have been the\ncorrect assignment had the correct state assignment at $p^{\\prime }$ been $\n|H_{A}\\rangle |V_{B}\\rangle $. We also need to ask for the backing of the\nentangled state $\\Phi ^{+}$.\n\n\\qquad There are many ways of preparing state $\\Phi ^{+}$, and this might\nalso be the right state to assign to some naturally occurring photon pairs\nthat needed no preparation. In each case there is a characterization in\nterms of some set of true magnitude claims describing the systems and events\ninvolved: these back the state assignment $\\Phi ^{+}$. It may be difficult\nor even impossible to give this characterization in a particular case, but\nthat is just an epistemic problem which need not be solved even by\nexperimenters skilled in preparing or otherwise assigning this state. $\\Phi\n^{+}$ will be correctly assigned at $p^{\\prime }$ only if some set of true\nmagnitude claims backing that assignment is accessible from $p^{\\prime }$:\nevents making them true must lie in the backward light-cone of $p^{\\prime }$.\n\n\\qquad A quantum state counterfactually depends on the true magnitude claims\nthat back it in somewhat the same way that a dispositional property depends\non its categorical basis. The state $\\Phi ^{+}$ may be backed by alternative\nsets of true magnitude claims just as a person may owe his immunity to\nsmallpox to any of a variety of categorical properties. If Walt owes his\nsmallpox immunity to antibodies, his possession of antibodies does not cause\nhis immunity: it is what his immunity consists in. No more is the state $\n\\Phi ^{+}$ caused by its backing magnitude claims: a statement assigning\nstate $\\Phi ^{+}$ is true only if backed by some true magnitude claims of\nthe right kind. A quantum state is counterfactually dependent on whatever\nmagnitude claims back it because backing is a kind of determination or\nconstitution relation, not because it is a causal relation.\n\n\\qquad In this view, a quantum state causally depends neither on the\nphysical situation of the (hypothetical or actual) agent assigning it nor on\nany of its backing magnitude claims. The correct state $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to\nbe assigned to $L$ at $q$ is not causally dependent on anything about Bob's\nphysical situation even if he happens to be located at $q$: it is not\ncausally dependent on the outcome of Bob's polarization measurement in\nregion 2: and it is not causally dependent on how Bob sets his polarizer in\nregion 2. But a quantum state assignment is not just a function of the\nsubjective epistemic state of any agent: If Bob or anyone else were to\nassign a state other than $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $L$ at $q$ he or she would be\nmaking a mistake.\n\n\\qquad The quantum derivation of (\\ref{CHSH violation}) shows not only that\nBell's particular correlations were to be expected, but also what they\ndepend on. They depend counterfactually but not causally on the quantum\nstate $\\Phi ^{+}$, and they also depend counterfactually on that state's\nbacking conditions, as described by true magnitude claims. The status of the\nquantum state disqualifies it from participation in causal relations, but\ntrue magnitude claims may be taken to describe beables recognized by quantum\nmechanics. To decide which conditions backing any of the states involved in\ntheir explanation describe causes of Bell's particular correlations or the\nevents they correlate we need to return to the connection between causation\nand chance.\n\n\\qquad The intuition that, other things being equal, a cause raises (or at\nleast alters) the chance of its effect is best cashed out in terms of an\ninterventionist counterfactual: $c$ is a cause of $e$ just in case $c,e$ are\ndistinct actual events and there is some conceivable intervention on $c$\nwhose occurrence would have altered the chance of $e$. Such an intervention\nneed not be the act of an agent: it could involve any modification in $c$ of\nthe right kind. Woodward [2003, p. 98] is one influential attempt to say\nwhat kind of external influence this would involve. Note that Einstein's\nformulation of a principle of local action also appeals to intervention:\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThe following idea characterizes the relative independence of objects far\napart in space ($A$ and $B$): external influence on $A$ has no \\textit{\nimmediate} (\"unmittelbar\") influence on $B$; this is known as the `principle\nof local action' (Einstein [1948, pp. 321-2])\n\\end{quote}\n\nI used the idea of intervention to argue against any causal dependence\nbetween events in $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$: anyone who accepts quantum\nmechanics accepts that it makes no sense to speak of an intervention in one\nof these regions that would affect a hypothetical agent's estimated chance\nof what happens in the other. So even though the outcome $e_{B}$ in $\\mathbf{\n2}$ backs the assignment $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $L$ at $q$, the outcome\\ in $\n\\mathbf{1}$ does not depend causally on $e_{B}$: for similar reasons,\nneither does the outcome in $\\mathbf{2}$\\ depend on that in $\\mathbf{1}$.\nThe same idea can now be used to show that both these outcomes \\textit{do}\ndepend causally on whatever event $o$ in the overlap of the backward light\ncones of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$\\ warranted assignment of state $\\Phi\n^{+}$---an event truly described by magnitude claims that backed this\nassignment.\n\n\\qquad Assume first that the events $a,b$ at which the polarizers are set on\na particular occasion occur in the overlap of the backward light cones of $\n\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$: this assumption will later be dropped. Let $r$\nbe a point outside the future light cones of $e_{A},e_{B}$ but within the\nfuture light cone of the event $o$. Let $e_{A}\\uplus e_{B}$ be the event of\nthe joint occurrence of\\ $e_{A},e_{B}$. This is an event of a type to which\nthe Born rule is applicable: the application yields its chance $\nCh_{r}(e_{A}\\uplus e_{B})=$ $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A},V_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\cos ^{2}\\angle ab$. We already saw that $Ch_{r}(e_{A})=\\Pr\n{}_{_{a,b}{}}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n=\\Pr {}_{_{a,b}{}}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{B})=Ch_{r}(e_{B})$. The event $o$ affects\nall these chances: had a different event $o^{\\prime }$ occurred backing the\nassignment of a different state (e.g. $|H_{A}\\rangle |V_{B}\\rangle $), or no\nevent backing any state assignment, then any or all of these chances could\nhave been different. Since it makes sense to speak of an agent altering the\nchance of event $o$ at $s$ in its past light cone, we have\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 53618, "prevtext": "\nwhere, for example, $E(a,b)\\equiv\n\\Pr_{a,b}(+1,+1)+\\Pr_{a,b}(-1,-1)-\\Pr_{a,b}(+1,-1)-\\Pr_{a,b}(-1,+1)$.

Nevertheless $Ch_{q}(e_{A}|e_{B})\\neq Ch_{q}(e_{A}|\n\\bar{e}_{B})$: in this sense $e_{A}$ depends counterfactually but not\ncausally on $e_{B}$. Does such counterfactual dependence provide reason\nenough to conclude that $e_{A}$ is part of the explanation of $e_{B}$? An\nobvious objection is that because of the symmetry of the situation with $\n\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$ space-like separated there is an equally strong\nreason to conclude that $e_{B}$ is part of the explanation of $e_{A}$,\ncontrary to the fundamentally asymmetric nature of the explanation relation.\nBut one can see that this objection is not decisive by paying attention to\nthe contrasting epistemic perspectives associated with the different\nphysical situations of hypothetical agents Alice* and Bob* with world-lines\nconfined to interiors of the light cones of $\\mathbf{1}$, $\\mathbf{2}$\nrespectively.\n\n\\qquad As his world-line enters the future light cone of $\\mathbf{2}$ Bob*\ncomes into position to know the outcome at $\\mathbf{2}$ while still\nphysically unable to observe the outcome at $\\mathbf{1}$. His epistemic\nsituation is then analogous to that \\ of a hypothetical agent Chris in a\nworld with a Newtonian absolute time, in a position to know the outcome of\npast events but physically unable to observe any future event. Many have\nbeen tempted to elevate the epistemic asymmetry of Chris's situation into a\nglobal metaphysical asymmetry in which the future is open while the past is\nfixed and settled. It is then a short step to a metaphysical view of\nexplanation as a productive relation in which the fixed past gives rise to\nthe (otherwise) open future, either deterministically or stochastically.\n\\footnote{\nSee, for example, Maudlin [2007, pp. 173-8].}\n\n\\qquad Such a move from epistemology to metaphysics should always be treated\nwith deep suspicion. But in this case it is clearly inappropriate in a\nrelativistic space-time since the \"open futures\" of agents like Alice* and\nBob* cannot be unified into \\textit{the} open future. This prompts a retreat\nto a metaphysically drained view of explanation as rooted in cognitive\nconcerns of a physically situated agent, motivated by the need to unify,\nextend and efficiently deploy the limited information to which it has access.\n\n\\qquad For many purposes it is appropriate to regard the entire scientific\ncommunity as a (spatially) distributed agent, and to think of the provision\nof scientific explanations as aiding \\textit{our} collective epistemic and\npractical goals. This is appropriate insofar as localized agents share an\nepistemic perspective, with access to the same information about what has\nhappened. But Alice* and Bob* do not have access to the same information at\ntime $t_{2}$ or $t_{3}$ since they are then space-like separated. So it is\nentirely appropriate for Bob* to use $e_{B}$ to explain $e_{A}$ and for\nAlice* to use $e_{A}$ to explain $e_{B}$. This does not make explanation a\nsubjective matter for two reasons. There is an objective physical difference\nbetween the situations of Alice* and Bob* underlying the asymmetry of their\nepistemic perspectives: and by adopting either perspective in thought (as I\nhave encouraged the reader to do) anyone can come to appreciate how each\nexplanation can help make Bell's correlations seem less puzzling.\nAdmittedly, neither explanation is very deep, and I will end by noting one\npuzzle that remains.\n\n\\qquad By meeting both minimal requirements on explanation, the application\nof quantum theory enables us to explain Bell's correlations. But \n\\QTR{frametitle}{is} this explanation local? Several senses of locality are\nrelevant here. \\QTR{frametitle}{T}he explanation involves no superluminal\ncausal dependence. As stated, the condition of Local Causality is not\napplicable to the quantum mechanical explanation since it presupposes the\nuniqueness of the probability to which it refers. (\\ref{FactorizabilitySU})\n(and presumably also (\\ref{Factorizability})) are violated, but Bell ([2004,\np. 243]) preferred to see (\\ref{Factorizability}) as not a formulation but a\nconsequence of `local causality': I have argued that it is not. To retain\nits connection to (IP), a version of Local \\ Causality should speak of\nchances rather than general probabilities. A version that equates the\nunconditional chance of $e_{A}$ to its chance conditional on $e_{B}$ holds,\nno matter how these chances are relativized to the same space-time point.\nBut a version that is clearly motivated by the intuitive principle (IP)\nwould rather equate the unconditional chance of $e_{A}$ to its chance\nconditional on \\textit{an intervention that produces} $e_{B}$. However this\nversion is inapplicable since acceptance of quantum mechanics renders\nsenseless talk of interventions producing $e_{B}$.\n\n\\qquad The explanation one can give by applying quantum mechanics appeals to \n\\textit{chances} that are localized, insofar as they are assigned at\nspace-time points that may be thought to offer the momentary perspective of\na hypothetical idealized agent whose credences they would guide. But these\nchances are not quantum beables and they are not physical propensities\ncapable of manifestation at those locations (or anywhere else). The only\ncauses figuring in the explanation are localized where the physical systems\nare whose magnitudes back the assignment of state $\\Phi ^{+}$. That chances\nare not propensities becomes clear when one drops the assumption that $a,b$\noccur in the overlap of the backward light cones of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\n\\mathbf{2}$, as depicted in Figure 5. \\FRAME{fhF}{3.4549in}{3.039in}{0pt}{}{\n}{Figure}{\\special{language \"Scientific Word\";type\n\"GRAPHIC\";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display \"USEDEF\";valid_file \"T\";width\n3.4549in;height 3.039in;depth 0pt;original-width 5.8816in;original-height\n5.1673in;cropleft \"0\";croptop \"1\";cropright \"1\";cropbottom \"0\";tempfilename\n'NDR1RI09.wmf';tempfile-properties \"XPR\";}}\n\nIf $a,b$ are set at the last moment, the chance of $e_{A}\\uplus e_{B}$ that\nfigures in its explanation may be located \\textit{later} in the laboratory\nframe than $e_{A},e_{B}$.

They are a localized\nagent's objective guide to credence about epistemically inaccessible events.\n\n\\qquad I will conclude by noting one sense in which the explanation one\\ can\ngive using quantum mechanics is not local as it stands. Though it is a\n(non-factorizable) cause of \\ events of types $A,B$ in regions $\\mathbf{1,}$ \n$\\mathbf{2}$ respectively, the event $o$ is not connected to its effects by\nany spatiotemporally continuous causal process described by quantum\nmechanics. This puts the explanation in tension with the\\textit{\\ first }\nconjunct of Bell's ([2004, p. 239]) intuitive locality principle (IP):\n\\newline\n\\textit{\"The direct causes (and effects) of events are near by}, and even\nthe indirect causes (and effects) are no further away than permitted by the\nvelocity of light.\"\n\n$o$ is separated from both recording events in regions $\\mathbf{1,}$ $\n\\mathbf{2}$ in time, and from at least one in space. If $o$ is not merely a\ncause but a \\textit{direct} cause of these events then it violates the first\nconjunct of (IP) because it is \\textit{not} nearby. But if one adopts the\npresent view of quantum mechanics, the theory has no resources to describe\nany causes mediating between $o$ and these recording events. So while their\nquantum explanation is not explicitly inconsistent with the first conjunct\nof (IP), mediating causes could be found only by constructing a new theory.\nBell's work has clearly delineated the obstacles that would have to be\novercome on that path.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{1} Bell, J.S.

Bell claims these correlations\nare realizable according to quantum mechanics but that they cannot be\nexplained without action at a distance. While it is generally acknowledged\nthat quantum mechanics successfully predicts Bell's particular correlations,\ndemonstrating this will illustrate the present view of quantum mechanics. To\ndecide whether it also explains them we need to ask what more is required of\nan explanation.\n\n\\qquad What we take to be a satisfactory explanation has changed during the\ndevelopment of physics, and we may confidently expect such change to\ncontinue. One who accepts quantum mechanics is able to offer a novel kind of\nexplanation. Nevertheless, explanations of phenomena using quantum mechanics\nmay be seen to meet two very general conditions met by many, if not all,\ngood explanations in physics.\n\n(i) They show that the phenomenon to be explained was to be expected, and\n\n(ii) they say what it depends on.\\newline\nQuantum mechanics enables us to give explanations meeting both conditions.\n\n\\qquad Meeting the first condition is straightforward. Anyone accepting\nquantum mechanics can use the \\ref{Born} applied to state $\\Phi ^{+}$ to\ncalculate joint probabilities such as $\\Pr_{a,b}(A,B)$ and go on to derive (\n\\ref{CHSH violation}). So for anyone who accepts quantum mechanics,\nviolation of the CHSH inequalities is to be expected. But it is worth\nshowing in more detail how quantum mechanics can be applied to derive (\\ref\n{CHSH violation}) because this will help to exhibit the relational nature of\nquantum states and probabilities while making it clear that a precise\nformulation of quantum mechanics need not use the word `measurement' or any\nother term on Bell's list of proscribed words [2004, p. 215].\\FRAME{fhF}{\n3.5916in}{3.039in}{0pt}{}{}{Figure}{\\special{language \"Scientific Word\";type\n\"GRAPHIC\";maintain-aspect-ratio TRUE;display \"USEDEF\";valid_file \"T\";width\n3.5916in;height 3.039in;depth 0pt;original-width 5.6611in;original-height\n4.7841in;cropleft \"0\";croptop \"1\";cropright \"1\";cropbottom \"0\";tempfilename\n'NDR1RI08.wmf';tempfile-properties \"XPR\";}}\n\n\\qquad Figure 4 is a space-time diagram depicting space-like separated\npolarization measurements by Alice and Bob in regions 1,2 respectively on a\nphoton pair. Time is represented in the laboratory frame. At $t_{1}$ each\ntakes the polarization state of the $L-R$ photon pair to be $\\Phi ^{+}=1/\n\\sqrt{2}(|HH\\rangle +|VV\\rangle )$. What justifies this quantum state\nassignment is their knowledge of the conditions under which the photon pair\nwas produced---perhaps by parametric down-conversion of laser light by\npassage through a non-linear crystal. Such knowledge depends on information\nabout the physical systems involved in producing the pair. This state\nassignment is backed by significant magnitude claims about such systems---if\nanything counts as a claim about beables recognized by quantum mechanics,\nthese do. Then Alice measures polarization of photon $L$ along axis $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$, Bob measures polarization of photon $R$ along axis $b\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$. Decoherence at the photon detectors licenses both of them to treat the\nBorn rule measure corresponding to state assignment $\\Phi ^{+}$\\ as a\nprobability distribution over significant canonical magnitude claims about\nthe values of $A,B$.\n\n\\qquad At $t_{1}$ Alice and Bob should both assign state $\\Phi ^{+}$ and\napply the \\ref{Born}\\ to calculate the joint probability $\\Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi\n^{+}}(A,B)$ assigned to claims about the values of magnitudes $A,B$---claims\nthat we may, but need not, choose to describe as records of polarization\nmeasurements along both $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n,b\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$ axes---and hence the (well-defined) conditional probability $\n\\Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(A,B)/\\Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(B)=|\\langle A|B\\rangle\n|^{2} $. Each will then expect the observed non-localized correlations\nbetween the outcomes of polarization measurements in regions 1,2 when the\ndetectors are set along the $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n,b\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$ axes. They will expect analogous correlations as these axes are varied,\nand so they will expect (\\ref{CHSH violation})\\ (violating the CHSH\ninequality) in such a scenario.\n\n\\qquad At $t_{2}$, after recording polarization $V_{B}$ for $R$, Bob should\nassign pure state $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $L$ and use the Born Rule to calculate\nthe probabilities $\\Pr_{a}^{|V_{B}>}(A)=|\\langle A|V_{B}\\rangle |^{2}$ for\nAlice to record polarization of $L$ with respect to the $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$-axis. At $t_{2}$, Alice should assign state $\\hat{\\rho}=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\hat{1}$ to $L$, and use the Born Rule to calculate probability $\n\\Pr_{a}^{\\rho }(A)=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$ that she will record either polarization of $L$ with respect to the $a\n\n\n{{}^\\circ}\n\n$-axis. In this way each forms expectations as to the outcome of Alice's\nmeasurement on the best information available to him or her at $t_{2}$.\nAlice's statistics of her outcomes in many repetitions of the experiment are\njust what her quantum state $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\hat{1}$ for $L$ led her to expect, thereby helping to explain her results.\nBob's statistics for Alice's outcomes (in many repetitions in which his\noutcome is $V_{B}$) are just what his quantum state $|V_{B}\\rangle $ for $L$\nled him to expect, thereby helping him to explain Alice's results.\n\n\\qquad There is no question as to which, if either, of the quantum states $\n|V_{B}\\rangle $, $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\hat{1}$ was the \\textit{real} state of Alice's photon at $t_{2}$. Neither\nof the different probabilities $|\\langle A|V_{B}\\rangle |^{2}$ or $\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n$ represents a unique physical propensity at $t_{2}$ of Alice's\noutcome---even though neither its chance at $p$ nor its chance at $q$ is\nsubjective. This discussion applies independent of the time-order in Alice's\nframe of the regions 1, 2 in Figure 1: had she been moving away from Bob\nfast enough, she would have represented 1 as earlier than 2.\n\n\\qquad It is widely acknowledged that one cannot explain a phenomenon merely\nby showing that it was to be expected in the circumstances. To repeat a\nhackneyed counterexample, the falling barometer does not explain the coming\nstorm even though it gives one reason to expect a storm in the\ncircumstances. As a joint effect of a common cause, a symptom does not\nexplain its other independent effects. But a system's being in a quantum\nstate at a time is not a symptom of causes specified by the true magnitude\nclaims that back it since it is not an event distinct from the\\ conditions\nthose claims describe. Each event figuring in Bell's particular correlations\nis truly described by a canonical magnitude claim. We may choose to describe\nsome, but not all, such events as an outcome of a quantum measurement on a\nsystem: the probabilities of many of those events depend counterfactually on\nthe particular entangled state assigned at $t_{1}$---if that state had been\ndifferent, so would these probabilities. But this dependence is not causal.\nIn quantum mechanics, neither states nor probabilities are the sorts of\nthings that can bear causal relations: in Bell's terminology, they are not\nbeables.\n\n\\qquad When relativized to the physical situation of an actual or\nhypothetical agent, a quantum state assignment is objectively true or\nfalse---which depends on the state of the world. More specifically, a\nquantum state assignment is made true by the true magnitude claims that back\nit. One true magnitude claim backing the assignment of $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $\nL $ at $q$ reports the outcome of Bob's polarization measurement in region 2\nof Figure 1: but there are others, since this would not have been the\ncorrect assignment had the correct state assignment at $p^{\\prime }$ been $\n|H_{A}\\rangle |V_{B}\\rangle $. We also need to ask for the backing of the\nentangled state $\\Phi ^{+}$.\n\n\\qquad There are many ways of preparing state $\\Phi ^{+}$, and this might\nalso be the right state to assign to some naturally occurring photon pairs\nthat needed no preparation. In each case there is a characterization in\nterms of some set of true magnitude claims describing the systems and events\ninvolved: these back the state assignment $\\Phi ^{+}$. It may be difficult\nor even impossible to give this characterization in a particular case, but\nthat is just an epistemic problem which need not be solved even by\nexperimenters skilled in preparing or otherwise assigning this state. $\\Phi\n^{+}$ will be correctly assigned at $p^{\\prime }$ only if some set of true\nmagnitude claims backing that assignment is accessible from $p^{\\prime }$:\nevents making them true must lie in the backward light-cone of $p^{\\prime }$.\n\n\\qquad A quantum state counterfactually depends on the true magnitude claims\nthat back it in somewhat the same way that a dispositional property depends\non its categorical basis. The state $\\Phi ^{+}$ may be backed by alternative\nsets of true magnitude claims just as a person may owe his immunity to\nsmallpox to any of a variety of categorical properties. If Walt owes his\nsmallpox immunity to antibodies, his possession of antibodies does not cause\nhis immunity: it is what his immunity consists in. No more is the state $\n\\Phi ^{+}$ caused by its backing magnitude claims: a statement assigning\nstate $\\Phi ^{+}$ is true only if backed by some true magnitude claims of\nthe right kind. A quantum state is counterfactually dependent on whatever\nmagnitude claims back it because backing is a kind of determination or\nconstitution relation, not because it is a causal relation.\n\n\\qquad In this view, a quantum state causally depends neither on the\nphysical situation of the (hypothetical or actual) agent assigning it nor on\nany of its backing magnitude claims. The correct state $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to\nbe assigned to $L$ at $q$ is not causally dependent on anything about Bob's\nphysical situation even if he happens to be located at $q$: it is not\ncausally dependent on the outcome of Bob's polarization measurement in\nregion 2: and it is not causally dependent on how Bob sets his polarizer in\nregion 2. But a quantum state assignment is not just a function of the\nsubjective epistemic state of any agent: If Bob or anyone else were to\nassign a state other than $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $L$ at $q$ he or she would be\nmaking a mistake.\n\n\\qquad The quantum derivation of (\\ref{CHSH violation}) shows not only that\nBell's particular correlations were to be expected, but also what they\ndepend on. They depend counterfactually but not causally on the quantum\nstate $\\Phi ^{+}$, and they also depend counterfactually on that state's\nbacking conditions, as described by true magnitude claims. The status of the\nquantum state disqualifies it from participation in causal relations, but\ntrue magnitude claims may be taken to describe beables recognized by quantum\nmechanics. To decide which conditions backing any of the states involved in\ntheir explanation describe causes of Bell's particular correlations or the\nevents they correlate we need to return to the connection between causation\nand chance.\n\n\\qquad The intuition that, other things being equal, a cause raises (or at\nleast alters) the chance of its effect is best cashed out in terms of an\ninterventionist counterfactual: $c$ is a cause of $e$ just in case $c,e$ are\ndistinct actual events and there is some conceivable intervention on $c$\nwhose occurrence would have altered the chance of $e$. Such an intervention\nneed not be the act of an agent: it could involve any modification in $c$ of\nthe right kind. Woodward [2003, p. 98] is one influential attempt to say\nwhat kind of external influence this would involve. Note that Einstein's\nformulation of a principle of local action also appeals to intervention:\n\n\\begin{quote}\nThe following idea characterizes the relative independence of objects far\napart in space ($A$ and $B$): external influence on $A$ has no \\textit{\nimmediate} (\"unmittelbar\") influence on $B$; this is known as the `principle\nof local action' (Einstein [1948, pp. 321-2])\n\\end{quote}\n\nI used the idea of intervention to argue against any causal dependence\nbetween events in $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$: anyone who accepts quantum\nmechanics accepts that it makes no sense to speak of an intervention in one\nof these regions that would affect a hypothetical agent's estimated chance\nof what happens in the other. So even though the outcome $e_{B}$ in $\\mathbf{\n2}$ backs the assignment $|V_{B}\\rangle $ to $L$ at $q$, the outcome\\ in $\n\\mathbf{1}$ does not depend causally on $e_{B}$: for similar reasons,\nneither does the outcome in $\\mathbf{2}$\\ depend on that in $\\mathbf{1}$.\nThe same idea can now be used to show that both these outcomes \\textit{do}\ndepend causally on whatever event $o$ in the overlap of the backward light\ncones of $\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$\\ warranted assignment of state $\\Phi\n^{+}$---an event truly described by magnitude claims that backed this\nassignment.\n\n\\qquad Assume first that the events $a,b$ at which the polarizers are set on\na particular occasion occur in the overlap of the backward light cones of $\n\\mathbf{1}$ and $\\mathbf{2}$: this assumption will later be dropped. Let $r$\nbe a point outside the future light cones of $e_{A},e_{B}$ but within the\nfuture light cone of the event $o$. Let $e_{A}\\uplus e_{B}$ be the event of\nthe joint occurrence of\\ $e_{A},e_{B}$. This is an event of a type to which\nthe Born rule is applicable: the application yields its chance $\nCh_{r}(e_{A}\\uplus e_{B})=$ $Pr_{a,b}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A},V_{B})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n\\cos ^{2}\\angle ab$. We already saw that $Ch_{r}(e_{A})=\\Pr\n{}_{_{a,b}{}}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{A})=\n\n\n{\\frac12}\n\n=\\Pr {}_{_{a,b}{}}^{\\Phi ^{+}}(V_{B})=Ch_{r}(e_{B})$. The event $o$ affects\nall these chances: had a different event $o^{\\prime }$ occurred backing the\nassignment of a different state (e.g. $|H_{A}\\rangle |V_{B}\\rangle $), or no\nevent backing any state assignment, then any or all of these chances could\nhave been different. Since it makes sense to speak of an agent altering the\nchance of event $o$ at $s$ in its past light cone, we have\n\n", "index": 21, "text": "\\begin{gather*}\nCh_{r}(e_{A}\\uplus e_{B}|do-o)\\neq Ch_{r}(e_{A}\\uplus e_{B}) \\\\\nCh_{r}(e_{A}|do-o)\\neq Ch_{r}(e_{A}) \\\\\nCh_{r}(e_{B}|do-o)\\neq Ch_{r}(e_{B})\n\\end{gather*}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle Ch_{r}(e_{A}\\uplus e_{B}|do-o)\\neq Ch_{r}(e_{A}\\uplus e_{B})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>\u228e</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>o</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2260</mo><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo>\u228e</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex11.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle Ch_{r}(e_{A}|do-o)\\neq Ch_{r}(e_{A})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>o</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2260</mo><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>A</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex12.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle Ch_{r}(e_{B}|do-o)\\neq Ch_{r}(e_{B})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>d</mi><mi>o</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>o</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2260</mo><mi>C</mi><msub><mi>h</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>e</mi><mi>B</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
