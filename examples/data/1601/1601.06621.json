Comput. Phys. {\\bf 153} 101; Nabais F. {\\it et al} 2015 Plasma Sci. Technol. {\\bf 17} 89), which can rapidly evaluate the linear growth rate of an eigenmode.\nIt is found that the fastest growing instabilities in the aforementioned ITER scenario are core-localized, low-shear toroidal Alfv\\'en eigenmodes.\nThe largest growth-rates occur in the scenario variant with higher core temperatures, which has the highest alpha-particle density and density gradient, for eigenmodes with toroidal mode numbers $n\\approx30$.\nAlthough these eigenmodes suffer significant radiative damping, which is also evaluated, their growth rates remain larger than those of the most unstable eigenmodes found in the variant of the ITER baseline scenario with lower core temperatures, which have $n\\approx15$ and are not affected by radiative damping.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\noindent{\\it Keywords}: Alfv\\'en eigenmodes, alpha particles, linear stability, burning plasmas, ITER\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nIn ITER, the performance of burning plasmas will depend on the population of alpha particles being well confined within the plasma core, as the heating of the deuterium-tritium (DT) plasma will then rely mainly on the energy of these suprathermal particles that are produced by core fusion reactions.\nA phenomenon that can potentially hinder the successful operation of ITER is therefore the destabilization of Alfv\\'en eigenmodes (AEs) by alpha particles \\cite{Fu1989}, whereby an increased radial transport of the latter could degrade the conditions necessary to sustain the fusion process and lead to power fluxes that exceed the design values of the ITER plasma facing components \\cite{Fasoli2007, Kurki-Suonio2009, Sharapov2013}.\n\nWhile ITER scenario development is underway and in the absence of experimental results for guidance, a comprehensive modelling approach is mandatory to forecast the stability of Alfv\\'enic activity in ITER plasmas.\nIn this article the stability of AEs is systematically addressed for the 15 MA ELMy H-mode ITER baseline scenario \\cite{Polevoi2002, Pinches2015, Lauber2015, Rodrigues2015} making use of a recently introduced framework \\cite{Rodrigues2015} that is based on the hybrid MHD drift-kinetic code \\mbox{CASTOR-K} \\cite{Borba1999, Nabais2015}, which is the key element in our suite of numerical codes.\nGrowth rates are computed systematically for all possible eigenmodes taking into account the alpha-particle drive, the Landau damping due to the DT ions, the thermalized helium (He) ions and the electrons, and the interaction with the Alfv\\'en continuum.\nRadiative damping is calculated a posteriori for the most relevant modes.\n\nThe remainder of this article is organized in three main sections.\nThe ITER baseline scenario, our modelling workflow and the numerical codes on which it relies are described in section \\ref{section_scenario_and_workflow}. \nsection \\ref{section_results} is dedicated to a detailed discussion of the results.\nFinally, a summary and conclusions are provided in section \\ref{section_conclusions}.\n\n\\section{Scenario and workflow}\n\\label{section_scenario_and_workflow}\n\n\\subsection{ITER baseline scenario}\n\\label{section_scenario}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{Figure_scenario.pdf}\n\\caption{Kinetic profiles from ASTRA simulations \\cite{Polevoi2002,Pereverzev2008} for two variants of the 15 MA ITER baseline scenario. Compared with the {\\it LoPed} scenario variant (left), {\\it HiPed} (right) is characterised by higher pedestal temperatures and lower temperatures at the plasma core (dashed lines), which results in lower densities of the main fusion products, namely alpha particles and He ashes.}\n\\label{figure_scenario}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe two variants of the ITER scenario that are analysed here have been produced by ASTRA transport simulations \\cite{Polevoi2002,Pereverzev2008}.\nIn both variants the plasma current is $I_p$ = 15 MA, the toroidal magnetic field is $B_0$ = 5.3 T, and the plasma major and minor radii are $R_0$ = 6.2 m and $a$ = 2 m, respectively.\nThe position of the magnetic axis is $R_\\mathrm{m}$ = 6.4 m.\n\nFigure \\ref{figure_scenario} shows density and temperature profiles versus radial coordinate $s=\\sqrt{\\Psi/\\Psi_\\mathrm{b}}$, where the poloidal magnetic flux $\\Psi$ is normalized to its boundary value $\\Psi_\\mathrm{b}$.\nIt can be seen that both scenario variants have approximately the same electron density $n_\\mathrm{e}$ and impurity content $n_\\mathrm{Z}$, which is essentially due to beryllium coming from the first wall.\nThe main difference between the two variants is that in the one on the left of figure \\ref{figure_scenario}, hereafter referred to as {\\it LoPed}, electron ($T_\\mathrm{e}$) and ion ($T_\\mathrm{i}$) temperatures are much lower at the pedestal and much higher at the core than in the {\\it HiPed} variant on the right.\nIn fact, the {\\it LoPed} and {\\it HiPed} scenarios cover a 3 keV range of pedestal-top temperatures around the expected value for ITER, which is approximately 5 keV on the basis of edge MHD stability \\cite{Huijsmans2013}.\nNaturally, the higher (by roughly 10 keV) core temperatures in {\\it LoPed} go together with a higher density of alpha particles $n_\\alpha$ and of helium ashes (thermalized alpha particles) $n_\\mathrm{He}$ in {\\it LoPed} than in {\\it HiPed}.\nThis in turn is reflected on the fuel density $n_\\mathrm{DT} = n_\\mathrm{D} + n_\\mathrm{T}$ being lower at the plasma core in {\\it LoPed} than in {\\it HiPed}.\nThe mix of deuterium and tritium is optimal in both scenario variants, i.e., $n_\\mathrm{D} = n_\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nFor convenience, differences in the safety factor $q$ will be discussed later, apropos figure \\ref{figure_most_unstable_modes_in_gap} and figure \\ref{figure_q_detail}.\n\n\\subsection{Numerical codes and modelling workflow}\n\\label{section_modelling}\n\nOur workhorse is \\mbox{CASTOR-K}, which is used to assess the stability of AEs through the computation of their linear growth-rates.\nBesides \\mbox{CASTOR-K} our suite of numerical codes comprises HELENA \\cite{Huysmans1991} to obtain magnetic equilibria, and the incompressible ideal-MHD code MISHKA \\cite{Mikhailovskii1997} to compute the eigenmodes of a given equilibrium.\nThe extensive identification of all the AEs of an equilibrium is key to the success of our methodical stability-analysis approach.\nFor this reason MISHKA has been preferred to the resistive-MHD code CASTOR, which we also use to calculate radiative-damping rates, as reported in section \\ref{section_radiative_damping}.\nIn a simple performance test done by executing both MHD codes in the same CPU, with the same input, MISHKA calculated an eigenmode in around 2.5 s, while CASTOR took approximaely 23.5 s to compute the same eigenmode.\nMISHKA is therefore roughly 10 times faster than CASTOR, which makes it an adequate tool to solve for thousands of eigenmodes in a reasonably short time.\n\nWe focus on eigenmodes with toroidal mode number $n$ ranging from 1 to 50 in order to stay within the limits of the drift-kinetic ordering for alpha particles, i.e., $k_\\perp\\rho_\\alpha<1$ where $k_\\perp$ is the AE perpedicular wavenumber and $\\rho_\\alpha$ is the gyroradius of the alpha particles \\cite{Rodrigues2015}.\nWe further restrict our analysis to AEs whose eigenfrequency falls in one of the first three gaps of the ideal shear Alfv\\'en wave continuum, namely (ordered by increasing frequency) the Toroidicity induced AE (TAE) gap, the Ellipticity induced AE (EAE) gap, and the Non-circular triangularity-induced AE (NAE) gap \\cite{Fu1989, Betti1991, Kramer1998}.\nAll possible TAEs, EAEs, and NAEs with $n\\leq 50$ have been determined by scanning the mode frequency $\\omega/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$ from $0.01$ to $2.0$, a value higher than the top frequency of the NAE gap for the range of $n$ considered.\nThe scan step is $2.0\u00c3\u0097\\times10^{-5}$, which we have found to be sufficiently small not to miss eigenmodes.\nAt every step of the scan, the quantity $(\\omega/\\omega_\\mathrm{A})^2$ is input to MISHKA as a guess of the mode eigenvalue which, upon convergence, is returned together with the corresponding mode eigenfunction.\nValid AEs are subsequently collected from the large set of eigenmodes produced by the frequency scan. \nThe selection is based on two criteria, namely, the eigenfunction must be well-resolved radially \\cite{Rodrigues2015}, and the mode cannot be affected by continuum damping. \nWe account for the effect of continuum damping in a straightforward, binary way.\nA given AE is considered to be fully damped if its frequency matches the ideal Alfv\\'en continuum at any radial position where the mode amplitude exceeds 1\\% of its maximum, otherwise continuum damping is not taken into consideration at all for that mode.\nA total of 705 AEs have successfully passed this validation process for {\\it LoPed}, and 401 for {\\it HiPed}.\nThe selected AEs are then processed by \\mbox{CASTOR-K}, which calculates the energy $\\delta W_\\mathrm{p}$ exchanged between a mode and a given population p of plasma particles.\nThe associated contribution to the growth rate, $\\gamma_\\mathrm{p}=\\mathrm{Im}(\\delta W_\\mathrm{p})/(2\\omega W_\\mathrm{k})$, where $W_\\mathrm{k}$ is the kinetic energy of the mode perturbation \\cite{Borba1999} is computed by \\mbox{CASTOR-K} as well --- it is the basic quantity used in the stability analysis of eigenmodes.\n\nFour \\mbox{CASTOR-K} runs have been done for each mode to calculate the drive due to the alpha particles ($\\alpha$) and the Landau damping due to the interaction with the bulk ions (DT), the electrons (e) and the helium ashes (He).\nThe net growth rate of the AE is then obtained by summing these 4 contributions, i.e., \n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma =

systematic than the calculation of the other drive and damping terms,\nit is discussed separately in section \\ref{section_radiative_damping}. \nThe radial structure and frequency distribution of AEs within the TAE gap is discussed in section \\ref{section_TAE_gap}.\n\n\\subsection{AE stability}\n\\label{section_growth_rates}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{Figure_growth_rates_all_AE.pdf}\n\\caption{Linear growth rates $\\gamma$

TAEs appear in dark-blue patterns which correspond to frequencies around $\\omega_\\mathrm{A}/2$ and are the most unstable.}\n\\label{figure_growth_rates_all_AE}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe linear growth rates computed with \\mbox{CASTOR-K} for all the valid AEs found in both variants of the ITER baseline scenario are represented in figure \\ref{figure_growth_rates_all_AE}, where different symbols are used for TAEs, EAEs, and NAEs (notice the normalization to the Alfv\\'en frequency instead of the more common mode frequency).\nA quite noticeable feature of the growth rates in figure \\ref{figure_growth_rates_all_AE} is that they are larger in {\\it LoPed} than in {\\it HiPed}, which is consistent with the much higher alpha-particle density and density gradient in the {\\it LoPed} variant of the scenario --- see figure \\ref{figure_scenario}.\nMoreover, it is striking that although a large number of EAEs and NAEs have positive growth rates in {\\it LoPed}, clearly in both scenario variants all markedly unstable modes are TAEs.\nNo AEs have been found for $n<7$ in {\\it LoPed} and $n<13$ in {\\it HiPed}.\n\nFigure \\ref{figure_growth_rates_TAE} shows the TAEs from figure \\ref{figure_growth_rates_all_AE} with their radial location, which is defined as the position of the maximum amplitude of their strongest poloidal harmonic.\nIt is clear that the unstable modes are well localized at the core of the plasma, inside the region $s\\lesssim 0.48$ for {\\it LoPed} and $s\\lesssim 0.32$ for {\\it HiPed}.\nIt can further be seen from the radial profile of $q$ in figure \\ref{figure_most_unstable_modes_in_gap} that these modes exist within the low magnetic-shear region of the plasma --- they are in fact LSTAEs.\nOnly a few modes exist for $n\\gtrsim 20$ in {\\it HiPed}.\nThese are low-frequency modes sitting close to the bottom of the TAE gap which do not cross the continuous spectrum, as seen in figure \\ref{figure_TAE_gap_distribution}.\nSuch is not the case in {\\it LoPed} for which more modes exist for high $n$.\nThis is due to the extended low magnetic-shear region, within which LSTAEs with higher eigenfrequencies can exist without matching the top boundary of the TAE gap, as seen in figure \\ref{figure_most_unstable_modes_in_gap}, and because in {\\it LoPed} higher-$n$ modes are located at inner positions than lower-$n$ modes.\nIndeed, a difference in the evolution of the location of LSTAEs as $n$ increases can also be seen in figure \\ref{figure_growth_rates_TAE}.\nWhile in {\\it HiPed} modes become progressively located at positions farther from the core, the opposite occurs in {\\it LoPed}.\nThis contrast in behavior results from $q(s)$ being monotonically increasing (see figure \\ref{figure_most_unstable_modes_in_gap}) together with the fact that within the $0.2<s<0.37$ region $q$ is below 1 in {\\it HiPed} but above 1 in {\\it LoPed}, as shown in figure \\ref{figure_q_detail}.\nConsidering the TAE condition $q(s)=(m\\pm 1/2)/n$ \\cite{Cheng1986} and that $m\\approx n$ for LSTAEs we obtain $q(s)\\approx 1\\pm 1/(2n)$.\nTherefore, since $q>1$ in {\\it LoPed}, $q$ must decrease as $n$ increases so TAEs move towards lower $s$ values, whereas for $q<1$ in {\\it HiPed} TAEs move towards higher $s$ values as $q$ increases.\nMoreover, the higher magnetic shear in {\\it HiPed} does not allow the existence of LSTAEs beyond $s \\approx 0.3$, that is for $n\\gtrsim20$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{Figure_growth_rates_TAE.pdf}\n\\caption{In both scenarios analysed the most unstable TAEs are core-localized, as indicated by their reddish colors.

verify a well-known estimate for the toroidal mode number of the most driven AE \\cite{Pinches2015, Rodrigues2015}.\nThe estimate is based on matching the width of passing alpha-particle orbits and the TAE width, which leads to $n\\approx s/q^2\\times a/R_\\mathrm{m} \\times \\Omega_{\\alpha}/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$, where the cyclotron frequency of the alpha particles is $\\Omega_{\\alpha} \\approx 2.5\\times10^8$ rad/s and $q(s)$ is evaluated at the location $s$ of the AE with the highest drive.\nBy using $q(0.37) \\approx 1.016$ we arrive at $n \\approx 26$ in {\\it LoPed}, while $q(0.17) \\approx 0.968$ in {\\it HiPed} leads to $n \\approx 13$. \nConsidering the simplicity of the rationale behind them, these are reasonable guesses for the toroidal mode numbers of the most driven, and for that matter also of the most unstable AEs. \nHowever, it must be remarked that the above formula depends significantly on the location of the most driven modes, which could not have been known with accuracy beforehand.\n\n\\subsection{Radiative damping}\n\\label{section_radiative_damping}\n\nWith the introduction of finite gyroradius effects TAEs become coupled with Kinetic Alfv\\'en Waves (KAWs), which carry energy in the radial direction away from the eigenmode in an intrinsic TAE damping process known as radiative damping \\cite{Rosenbluth1975, Mett1992, Candy1994, Nyqvist2012, Pinches2015}.\nIn the case of LSTAEs only the symmetric modes suffer significant radiative damping, as the KAWs excited by the anti-symmetric LSTAEs interfere within the mode localization region resulting in a negligible net energy flux \\cite{Mett1992, Nyqvist2012}.\n\nRadiative damping has previously been shown to have a significant contribution to the net growth rate $\\gamma$ in {\\it LoPed} \\cite{Rodrigues2015}, namely for its most unstable mode, a symmetric LSTAE sitting very close to the bottom of the TAE gap.\nOn the contrary, the most unstable modes in {\\it HiPed} are anti-symmetric LSTAEs, so their radiative damping is expected to be very small \\cite{Nyqvist2012}.\nHere, the same approach that has been followed in \\cite{Rodrigues2015} is used to estimate $\\gamma_\\mathrm{rad}$, the radiative-damping contribution to the net growth rate of selected AEs from both scenario variants.\nThe method \\cite{Gorelenkov1992, Mett1992, Candy1994, Connor1994} relies on a formal equivalence between a non-ideal MHD model that accounts for finite parallel electric field and first-order ion-gyroradius effects, and the resistive MHD model that is implemented in the CASTOR eigenvalue code \\cite{Kerner1998}. \n\nIn order to compute non-ideal eigenmodes and determine their radiative-damping rates, in place of the (usually real) resistivity we input to CASTOR

electron collision frequency), which leads to an imaginary frequency component and to the corresponding damping rate $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}$.\nWe thus obtain the MHD growth-rate $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}$ as a function of $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$, from which $\\gamma_\\mathrm{rad}$ can be inferred.\n\nOur method is based on the fact that of the two components of non-ideal eigenmodes, KAWs suffer much stronger collisional damping than AEs \\cite{Hasegawa1976, Candy1994}.\nTherefore, as $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ is increased from zero $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}$ rises mainly due to the dominant damping of KAWs, up to a certain value of $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ for which all KAW energy is damped by collisional friction and only the much weaker damping of the AE remains.\nThis change of behavior is observed as a modification of the slope of the $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}$ versus $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ curve which shows a noticeable knee, as discussed below.\nAn indication of the scan limits can be taken from known expressions of $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$, for which $0<\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})\\ll 1$ \\cite{Candy1994, Connor1994}.\nIt should therefore not be necessary to extend the scan to $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})>1$ to observe the knee.\n\nThe right-hand side of equation \\ref{equation_complex_resistivity} is evaluated at the position of the eigenmode in question.\nAt the location of all the eigenmodes of interest the normalized ion gyroradius $\\rho_\\mathrm{i}/R_\\mathrm{m}$ has the value $6.25\u00c3\u0097\\times10^{-4}$ in {\\it LoPed} and $3.43\u00c3\u0097\\times10^{-4}$ in {\\it HiPed}, whereas $q$ is approximately $1.02$ in {\\it LoPed} and $0.97$ in {\\it HiPed}.\nFor the AE frequency $\\omega$ in equation \\ref{equation_complex_resistivity} we use the value given by MISHKA.\nNotice that this frequency would only be the same as the frequency of the eigenmode given by CASTOR if $\\eta=0$, i.e., in the ideal-MHD case if compressibility is negligible.\nIn our calculations we found that the CASTOR frequency is generally slightly higher, by up to 5\\%, than the MISHKA frequency.\nMoreover, as can be seen in figure \\ref{figure_radiative_damping} the frequency of the CASTOR eigenmode changes during a $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ scan --- except when radiative damping is very small.\nTo address these frequency changes and ensure that we are indeed analysing the intended AE, a scan is made not only in $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ but also in the guess frequency that is input to CASTOR.\nTo initiate a $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ scan we use a guess frequency that is close to the MISHKA eigenmode frequency. Subsequently, the guess frequency at every scan step is given by the frequency of the converged CASTOR eigenmode in the previous step of the scan.\nThis way it is guaranteed that the input given to CASTOR changes slowly and we are tracking the same eigenmode during the whole $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ scan, which considerably simplifies the process.\nBy scanning a range of initial guess-frequency values around the frequency of the MISHKA eigenmode we obtain a set of $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ scans.\nFrom this set we can then choose the scan for the non-ideal CASTOR eigenmode that corresponds to the desired ideal MISHKA eigenmode with coupled KAWs.\n\nThe $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ scan on the left of figure \\ref{figure_radiative_damping} is for the most unstable TAE in {\\it HiPed}, which we recall is anti-symmetric.\nThe constant slope of $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$ versus $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ exemplifies the outcome of a $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ scan for odd LSTAEs, which do not suffer noticeable radiative damping.\nAs discussed above, this is an expected result given the negligible energy carried away by the KAWs, and it has been observed for the other anti-symmetric and noticeably unstable modes in {\\it HiPed} as well.\nLoosely speaking, in this case the MHD damping rate is solely due to the weak damping of the ideal AE component of the non-ideal eigenmode, and it is therefore simply proportional to the wave dissipation-rate $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$.\nThe eigenfunctions calculated by CASTOR and by MISHKA are practically the same for these eigenmodes, as well as their frequencies which differ by no more than 1\\%.\n\nThe right side of figure \\ref{figure_radiative_damping} shows the $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ scan for the most unstable {\\it symmetric} TAE in {\\it HiPed} with the same $n=16$. \nThis eigenmode has a net growth-rate $\\gamma/\\omega_\\mathrm{A} \\approx 0.31\\%$.\nIt is localized at $s \\approx 0.15$ and its frequency is $\\omega/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}=0.481$.\nIn contrast with the TAE analysed on the left side of figure \\ref{figure_radiative_damping}, the CASTOR eigenmode frequency $\\omega/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$ now varies noticeably during the scan.\nSimultaneously, as $\\delta \\left(\\nu_\\mathrm{e}\\right)$ rises there is a significant change in the slope of the $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$ versus $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ curve, which eventually reaches a constant value as the curve asymptotically approaches a straight line.\nA break-in-slope (BIS) technique is used to pinpoint $\\delta_\\mathrm{rad}$, the value of $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ at the intersection of the two lines obtained by linear fitting the first and last few points of the curve, as shown by the green lines in figure \\ref{figure_radiative_damping}.\nFollowing the reasoning above, the ordinate at the knee of the curve (where its slope changes abruptly), which in this case is for the abscissa $\\delta_\\mathrm{rad}\\approx0.09$ is taken as the radiative-damping rate $\\gamma_\\mathrm{rad}/\\omega_\\mathrm{A} \\approx -0.57\\%$.\nAlthough the net growth rate calculated by \\mbox{CASTOR-K} for this particular AE is positive, the eigenmode is in fact stable when considering radiative damping, since $(\\gamma+\\gamma_\\mathrm{rad})/\\omega_\\mathrm{A} \\approx -0.26\\%$.\nNotice that these are somewhat rough estimates of the radiative-damping rate $\\gamma_\\mathrm{rad}$ that depend on several factors.\nIn particular they depend on the values of $T_\\mathrm{e}$ and $T_\\mathrm{i}$ used in equation \\ref{equation_complex_resistivity}, which are calculated at a particular value of $s$ chosen to represent the radial position of the eigenmode.\nThe uncertainty in $\\delta_\\mathrm{rad}$ must also be considered.\nEvidently, a different method could be used to determine the knee of the $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$ versus $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})$ curve.\nWe could for example choose the point where the slope of $\\gamma_\\mathrm{CASTOR}/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$ and the frequency $\\omega/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$ become practically stable, $\\delta(\\nu_\\mathrm{e})\\approx 0.15$. \nThe radiative-damping rate would in that case differ from the BIS value by approximately 20\\%.\nNevertheless, such a difference would not have a significant impact on the stability of the TAEs.\n\nTable \\ref{table_radiative_damping} summarizes the radiative-damping analysis that has been made for some of the most unstable eigenmodes in {\\it LoPed}, all of which are symmetric.\nThese modes have been chosen from the top of the two curves that can be seen on the left of figure \\ref{figure_growth_rates_TAE} peaking around $n=25$ and $n=31$. \nWhile the analysis confirms that radiative damping accounts for a significant fraction of the net growth-rate in {\\it LoPed}, it also shows that the most unstable eigenmode remains the same after taking radiative damping into account, as other unstable eigenmodes suffer a similar radiative-damping effect.

The $q=1$ surface is located at $s \\approx 0.2$ in {\\it LoPed} and $s \\approx 0.37$ in {\\it HiPed}.\n}\n\\label{figure_q_detail}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAt this point it is interesting to verify a well-known estimate for the toroidal mode number of the most driven AE \\cite{Pinches2015, Rodrigues2015}.\nThe estimate is based on matching the width of passing alpha-particle orbits and the TAE width, which leads to $n\\approx s/q^2\\times a/R_\\mathrm{m} \\times \\Omega_{\\alpha}/\\omega_\\mathrm{A}$, where the cyclotron frequency of the alpha particles is $\\Omega_{\\alpha} \\approx 2.5\\times10^8$ rad/s and $q(s)$ is evaluated at the location $s$ of the AE with the highest drive.\nBy using $q(0.37) \\approx 1.016$ we arrive at $n \\approx 26$ in {\\it LoPed}, while $q(0.17) \\approx 0.968$ in {\\it HiPed} leads to $n \\approx 13$. \nConsidering the simplicity of the rationale behind them, these are reasonable guesses for the toroidal mode numbers of the most driven, and for that matter also of the most unstable AEs. \nHowever, it must be remarked that the above formula depends significantly on the location of the most driven modes, which could not have been known with accuracy beforehand.\n\n\\subsection{Radiative damping}\n\\label{section_radiative_damping}\n\nWith the introduction of finite gyroradius effects TAEs become coupled with Kinetic Alfv\\'en Waves (KAWs), which carry energy in the radial direction away from the eigenmode in an intrinsic TAE damping process known as radiative damping \\cite{Rosenbluth1975, Mett1992, Candy1994, Nyqvist2012, Pinches2015}.\nIn the case of LSTAEs only the symmetric modes suffer significant radiative damping, as the KAWs excited by the anti-symmetric LSTAEs interfere within the mode localization region resulting in a negligible net energy flux \\cite{Mett1992, Nyqvist2012}.\n\nRadiative damping has previously been shown to have a significant contribution to the net growth rate $\\gamma$ in {\\it LoPed} \\cite{Rodrigues2015}, namely for its most unstable mode, a symmetric LSTAE sitting very close to the bottom of the TAE gap.\nOn the contrary, the most unstable modes in {\\it HiPed} are anti-symmetric LSTAEs, so their radiative damping is expected to be very small \\cite{Nyqvist2012}.\nHere, the same approach that has been followed in \\cite{Rodrigues2015} is used to estimate $\\gamma_\\mathrm{rad}$, the radiative-damping contribution to the net growth rate of selected AEs from both scenario variants.\nThe method \\cite{Gorelenkov1992, Mett1992, Candy1994, Connor1994} relies on a formal equivalence between a non-ideal MHD model that accounts for finite parallel electric field and first-order ion-gyroradius effects, and the resistive MHD model that is implemented in the CASTOR eigenvalue code \\cite{Kerner1998}. \n\nIn order to compute non-ideal eigenmodes and determine their radiative-damping rates, in place of the (usually real) resistivity we input to CASTOR the complex quantity \\cite{Candy1994, Connor1994}\n\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\eta = i 4 q^2 \\left\\{ \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{T_\\mathrm{e}}{T_\\mathrm{i}} \\left[ 1-i\\delta \\left(\\nu_\\mathrm{e}\\right) \\right] \\right\\} \\left( \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_\\mathrm{A}} \\right)^3 \\left(  \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{i}}{R_\\mathrm{m}} \\right)^2,\n\\label{equation_complex_resistivity}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\eta=i4q^{2}\\left\\{\\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{e}}}{T_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\left[1-i%&#10;\\delta\\left(\\nu_{\\mathrm{e}}\\right)\\right]\\right\\}\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{%&#10;\\mathrm{A}}}\\right)^{3}\\left(\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{i}}}{R_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)^{%&#10;2},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03b7</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>q</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>{</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>T</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi></msub><msub><mi>T</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>}</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>\u03c9</mi><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">A</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi></msub><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
