We developed a spectral imaging algorithm dedicated to the SZ observations of nearby galaxy clusters with {\\textit{Planck}{}}, with the aim of revealing gas density anisotropies related to the filamentary accretion of materials, or pressure discontinuities induced by the propagation of shock fronts. To optimize an unavoidable trade-off between angular resolution and precision of the SZ flux measurements, the algorithm performs a multiscale analysis of the SZ maps as well as of other extended components, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and the Galactic thermal dust. The demixing of the SZ signal is tackled through kernel weighted likelihood maximizations. The CMB anisotropies are further analyzed through a wavelet analysis, while the Galactic foregrounds and SZ maps are analyzed via a curvelet analysis that best preserves their anisotropic details. The algorithm performance has been tested against mock observations of galaxy clusters obtained by simulating the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ High Frequency Instrument and by pointing a few characteristic positions in the sky. These tests suggest that {\\textit{Planck}{}}~  should easily allow us to detect filaments in the cluster peripheries and detect large-scale shocks in colliding galaxy clusters that feature favorable geometry.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{Galaxy: clusters: general --- Galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium --- Shock waves}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nMost of the baryonic content of galaxy clusters is in the form of a hot ionized gas that is in pressure equilibrium with gravity. This intracluster medium (ICM) is detectable in X-rays via its bremsstrahlung emission, as well as in the millimetric band via the inverse Compton diffusion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, or the so-called Sunyaev-Zeldovich (hereafter SZ) effect. The excellent agreement between X-ray and SZ measurements of the central region of galaxy clusters, $r \\leq r_{500}$ \\footnote{$r_{\\Delta}$ is the radius of a ball whose density is $\\Delta$ times the critical density of the universe}, suggests that both observables accurately probe the integrated ICM thermal pressure \\citep[see, e.g.][]{Planck_early_XI_SZscaling}. Due to the quadratic dependence of the X-ray emission measure on the ICM density, X-ray observations mostly enlighten the physics of the innermost cluster regions ($r < r_{2500}$), while X-ray spectroscopy poorly constrains the outer regions. By contrast, the SZ Compton parameter is proportional to the integrated ICM pressure along the line of sight. Therefore, the SZ signal extends further out and enables us to explore the complex baryonic physics at play in the cluster outskirts.\n\n{\\textit{Planck}{}}~ is the third space satellite that has mapped the CMB over the full-sky. Its high sensitivity and unprecedented angular resolution allowed the detection of more than 1000 galaxy clusters classified in the Second {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ Catalogue SZ sources \\citep{Planck_2015_szcatalogue}. Releases of {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ data proved the strength of the SZ effect in detecting the ICM out to the cluster peripheries.  In particular, radially averaged measurements of the Compton parameter of 60 nearby massive clusters showed that their averaged pressure profile is similar to X-ray derived profiles below $r_{500}$, but slightly exceeds the theoretical predictions from cosmological simulations of cluster formation at $r \\ge r_{500}$ \\citep{Planck_2013_V_pressure}. A subsequent combination of  {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ and ROSAT data toward 18 of these clusters revealed the different natures of the hot gas entropy profiles of the cool core and non-cool core clusters at $r_{200}$ \\citep{Eckert_13a}, and also managed to discriminate between averaged gas fractions in the outer regions of the two cluster classes \\citep{Eckert_13b}. Complementary to radial profiles, maps of the Compton parameter provide us with a precious information that helps with the interpretation of these results.  Indeed, SZ maps allow us to identify merger shocks that locally raise the ICM entropy and accretion filaments that affect the ICM hydrostatic equilibrium via the anisotropic injection of turbulence. From an observational point of view, fine two-dimensional (2D) information helps with the identification of some sources of bias of the radially averaged SZ and X-ray flux measurements generated by structures projected along the line of sight. Furthermore, the detection of accretion filaments also identifies ICM regions that are likely inhomogeneous \\citep[e.g.][]{Vazza_13}, yielding nonlinear biases when assuming spherical symmetry in the inversion of the gas density from X-ray surface brightness profiles \\citep{Nagai_11}. The first analyses of Planck data have already allowed us to detect highly significant anisotropies in the cluster atmospheres, in particular two shock fronts in the Coma cluster \\citep{Planck_intermediate_X_coma} and a Mpc-scale filament connecting both components of the cluster pair A399-A401 \\citep{Planck_intermediate_VIII_filaments}. These results encourage us to develop an image restoration algorithm that could reveal SZ anisotropies down to a lower signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nThe SZ signal from galaxy clusters is a mixture of up to several extended emissions of Galactic and extragalactic origin that can be demixed through local likelihood maximizations. By taking advantage of kernel-weighted $\\chi^2$ minimisations, we propose to optimize the bias-variance trade-off of these estimates via a multi-scale analysis. Including a wavelet analysis of the CMB map and a curvelet analysis of the foreground maps, the proposed algorithm has been adapted to match the spectral responses and beams of the Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI), and includes, in particular, an iterative deconvolution of the frequency maps. After having detailed our algorithm in Section 2, we present mock HFI observations of galaxy clusters and discuss the algorithm performance in mapping the SZ signal from these simulations in Section 3. In the following analysis, intracluster distances are computed as angular diameter distances, assuming a $\\Lambda$-CDM cosmology with ${H}_\\mathrm{0} =70~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0.3$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.7$. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n   \\begin{center}\n  \\resizebox{\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{planck_gadget_f1.eps}}\n  \\caption{Left: Isotropic {$\\mathrm{{B}_{3}}$-spline{~}} wavelet function $\\psi$.

In order to take advantage of the angular\nresolution available at each frequency, we iteratively deconvolve\nall component maps from the HFI beams by means of a\nVan Cittert algorithm \\citep{VanCittert_1931}. More precisely, at each iteration $i$ we associate a set of denoised frequency maps with the component maps ${\\boldsymbol{{{A_{i}}}}}$ following {Equation~}(\\ref{equ:freq_maps}). We convolve these frequency maps with their specific beams and restore a new set of point-spread function (PSF)-convolved component maps $P*{\\boldsymbol{{{A_{n}}}}}$ via a new combination of WLS estimate and multi-scale denoising. Starting from a first guess ${\\boldsymbol{{{{A_{o}}}}}}(k,l) $, the Van Cittert iteration yields: \n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\t{\\boldsymbol{{{R_{n}(k, l)}}}} &=& {\\boldsymbol{{{{A_{o}}}}}}(k, l) - [P * {\\boldsymbol{{{{A_{n}}}}}} ](k, l) \\nonumber \\\\\n\t{\\boldsymbol{{{{A_{n+1}}}}}} &=& {\\boldsymbol{{{{A_{n}}}}}}+\\alpha {\\boldsymbol{{{R_{n}}}}}(k, l)\n\t\\label{equ:Van_cittert}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nAs proposed in \\citet{Murtagh_95}, the locus of the significant (i.e. nonzero) wavelet and curvelet coefficients of ${\\boldsymbol{{{{A_{o}}}}}}$ defines a `multiresolution support' that regularizes the algorithm. By reconstructing the residual ${\\boldsymbol{{{R_{n}(k, l)}}}}$ from the wavelet and curvelet coefficients located within this multiresolution support \\citep[see also][]{Starck_02}, we prevent any noise amplification during the Van Cittert iteration.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[h]\n   \\begin{center}\n  \\resizebox{.95\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{planck_gadget_f3.eps}}\n  \\caption{Compton parameter of two SPH simulated clusters presented in this work compared with real {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ measurements. {{Left panel: }} $y$ parameter obtained along an image cut intercepting both maxima of the \\textit{connected cluster} map displaced at $z=0.04$.

The hydro-simulations employed are carried out by the Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamic  code GADGET \\citep{springel05}.  The details of the simulations and the physics adopted are presented in \\cite{planelles.etal.14} and \\cite{rasia.etal.14}. Here, we briefly list the essential points and address the\nmentioned papers for a more exhaustive description. The\nclusters used in the present work come from two Lagrangian\nregions that were selected from a parent dark matter\ncosmological box. The regions are re-simulated at a higher-mass\nresolution, adding baryons either in gaseous or stellar\nform. The re-simulations treat processes such as radiative\ncooling; star formation and evolution; kinetic feedback by type\nIa and type II supernovae and from asymptotic Giant Branch\nstars; thermal feedback from active galactic nuclei resulting\nfrom gas accretion onto supermassive black holes \\citep[see also][]{ragone.etal.13}. Masses of dark matter and gas particles are equal to $m_{\\mathrm{dm}} = 8.47 \\times 10^8 h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{gas}}=1.53 \\times 10^8 h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, respectively. The adopted Plummer-equivalent softening length for computing the gravitational force is set to $\\epsilon = 5 h^{-1}$ kpc in comoving units up to $z=2$ then it is switched to the same value but in physical units. The minimum SPH smoothing length is $0.5 \\times \\epsilon$.\n\nTo prepare a few test cases that are representative of nearby clusters observed by {\\textit{Planck}{}}, we select three situations occuring in a rich and dense environment and displaced them at various distances from the observer. The first and second situations are two different time snapshots of the same Lagrangian region, referring to $z=0.25$ and $z=0$, respectively. The third case corresponds to a different region.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=.75cm,noitemsep]\n\\item A \\textit{massive accreting} cluster. \nWith a binding mass of $M_{200}= 7 \\times 10^{14} h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, this cluster exhibits a rather regular morphology in the innermost regions. However, the cluster periphery is more disturbed. In particular, the object has recently accreted a satellite that is currently lying at a projected distance of 2 Mpc. \nThe smaller object has a temperature of about $2$--$3$ keV, corresponding to a mass of a few $10^{14}  h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. Following its cosmic evolution, we see that it will orbit on the south to the main halo with a projected impact parameter of about $500$ kpc, and will lose most of its gas content. In the cosmic time selected, the satellite and main cluster are connected by a tenuous and irregular filament with Compton parameter of $y \\sim 10^{-5}$.\n\\item A \\textit{connected} cluster pair. \nAfter the merger described above and after having stripped most of the gas of the subclump, the main halo is approached by another massive object of comparable mass. At redshift zero the two systems lie on the same plane of the sky and are about $1.5$ Mpc apart. By studying their evolutions, we observed that they are moving toward each other and in the future they will merge. At the current epoch, they are connected by a bright filament with a Compton parameter of $y \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\\item A \\textit{colliding} cluster system. \nThis system is composed of multiple objects that are all located in the plane of the sky along a large-scale filamentary structure. The main cluster is at the center of the image and has a mass of $\\mathrm{M}_{500}\\sim 10^{15} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. It shows a prominent substructure at $\\sim$ 50 arcmin. This is the residual of a merger with two smaller groups. The violent merger with the main halo had an impact parameter of almost zero and the gas of one of the smallest systems has been completely stripped away.   The collision direction is witnessed by a prominent bow shock that is visible as a sharp SZ edge immediately to the west of the merged objects. A third cluster, connected by a filament, is located ahead of the shock outside the field of view. The snapshot shown corresponds to $z \\sim 0$, thus we cannot clearly see the future of this object. However, by looking at its past motion we presume that it will most likely produce a second major merger.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Galactic Dust and Instrumental Noise Properties Assumed at 350 GHz in the Mock HFI Frequency Maps. \\label{tab:bck_par}}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccc}\n\\tableline\\tableline\n \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Galactic}    &  Noise      & Median    &   Dust       & Median   \\\\\n \\multicolumn{2}{c}{coordinates} &  Standard   & Dust      &   Standard   & Dust to SZ   \\\\\n   $l$          &  $b$           &  Deviation  & Intensity &   Deviation & Intensity  \\\\\n   (deg)        &  (deg)         &  ($\\mu$K)   & ($\\mu$K)  &   ($\\mu$K)  & Ratio \\tablenotemark{a}  \\\\\n\\tableline\n   0& -15&   99.3&  923.6&  254.6&  8.6 \\\\\n   0& -30&   88.5&  591.8&  147.9&  5.8 \\\\\n  90& -60&   78.8&  397.0&   74.6&  3.5 \\\\\n   0& -60&   74.9&  104.8&   42.4&  1.0 \\\\\n  90& -30&   72.8&  612.1&  502.6&  6.7 \\\\\n  90& -15&   66.1& 1560.2&  422.3& 13.2 \\\\\n 270& -60&   64.3&  257.7&   70.2&  2.5 \\\\\n 270& -15&   60.8& 2229.5&  566.3& 22.4 \\\\\n 270& -30&   28.2&  550.5&  135.4&  4.7 \\\\\n\\tableline\n\\tableline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\tablecomments{Pixel areas are 1 square arcminute.

The SZ map of each cluster is also visible on the top panel of Fig. \\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_snr}. Fig. \\ref{Fig:a399_coma_vs_gadget} demonstrates, in particular, that displacing the \\textit{connected cluster} at $z=0.04$ yields an angular separation between the two cluster peaks that is comparable to the separation of both components of the cluster pair A399-A401. Moreover, displacing the  \\textit{colliding cluster} at $z=0.01$ leads to a Compton parameter decrement that matches its true analog that is measured across the most prominent shock front in Coma \\citep[see also][]{Planck_intermediate_X_coma}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Mock HFI frequency maps}\n\n\nTo emulate HFI observations of our simulated clusters, we choose a few characteristic regions of the sky in terms of thermal SZ signal-to-noise ratio and predict the 2D signal to be registered in each HFI channel by adding our tSZ maps to the expected specific intensities of the CMB and Galactic dust components. For each HFI channel and sky region, frequency maps $I(k, l, \\nu)$ are convolved with the HFI beam and added to a noise realization that matches the noise variance and power spectrum registered to the cluster scales in the raw data. The amplitude of the CMB SED is extracted from the Planck CMB map that is\nreconstructed using the Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis (SMICA) component separation algorithm \\citep{Planck_2013_XII_components}, while the amplitude of the Galactic dust SED accommodates the dust optical depth mapped at 353 GHz as a result of the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ all-sky model of thermal dust  \\citep{Planck_2013_XI_tdustmodel}. For simplicity, a constant spectral index, $\\beta$ = 1.8, is assumed for the dust SED, consistent with the first all-sky modeling from {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ and IRAS data \\citep{Planck_early_XIX_tdustmodel}. An example of mock HFI frequency maps of the \\textit{colliding} cluster system is shown for ($l=270^\\circ$, $b=-30^\\circ$) in Fig. \\ref{Fig:HFI_freqmaps}, while a few properties of the Galactic dust and instrumental noise included in the 350 GHz maps are summarized in Tab.\\ref{tab:bck_par} for each simulated sky position. The dust intensity in particular mostly depends on the Galactic latitude, and is shown to dominate the positive side of the thermal SZ signal ($f_{\\nu} > $ 217 GHz). \n\n\n\n\\subsection{SZ Map restoration}\n\n Figures \\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_snr}--\\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_redshift} present the restoration of simulated SZ maps for a soft thresholding, \n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17875, "prevtext": "\n\nTo further extract the curvelet coefficients of the component maps, we normalize wavelet coefficients to their standard deviation, ${\\mathscr{Wt}}' = {\\mathscr{Wt}}/d{\\mathscr{Wt}}$.

We convolve these frequency maps with their specific beams and restore a new set of point-spread function (PSF)-convolved component maps $P*{\\boldsymbol{{{A_{n}}}}}$ via a new combination of WLS estimate and multi-scale denoising.

The hydro-simulations employed are carried out by the Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamic  code GADGET \\citep{springel05}.  The details of the simulations and the physics adopted are presented in \\cite{planelles.etal.14} and \\cite{rasia.etal.14}. Here, we briefly list the essential points and address the\nmentioned papers for a more exhaustive description. The\nclusters used in the present work come from two Lagrangian\nregions that were selected from a parent dark matter\ncosmological box. The regions are re-simulated at a higher-mass\nresolution, adding baryons either in gaseous or stellar\nform. The re-simulations treat processes such as radiative\ncooling; star formation and evolution; kinetic feedback by type\nIa and type II supernovae and from asymptotic Giant Branch\nstars; thermal feedback from active galactic nuclei resulting\nfrom gas accretion onto supermassive black holes \\citep[see also][]{ragone.etal.13}. Masses of dark matter and gas particles are equal to $m_{\\mathrm{dm}} = 8.47 \\times 10^8 h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and $m_{\\mathrm{gas}}=1.53 \\times 10^8 h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, respectively. The adopted Plummer-equivalent softening length for computing the gravitational force is set to $\\epsilon = 5 h^{-1}$ kpc in comoving units up to $z=2$ then it is switched to the same value but in physical units. The minimum SPH smoothing length is $0.5 \\times \\epsilon$.\n\nTo prepare a few test cases that are representative of nearby clusters observed by {\\textit{Planck}{}}, we select three situations occuring in a rich and dense environment and displaced them at various distances from the observer. The first and second situations are two different time snapshots of the same Lagrangian region, referring to $z=0.25$ and $z=0$, respectively. The third case corresponds to a different region.\n\n\\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=.75cm,noitemsep]\n\\item A \\textit{massive accreting} cluster. \nWith a binding mass of $M_{200}= 7 \\times 10^{14} h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, this cluster exhibits a rather regular morphology in the innermost regions. However, the cluster periphery is more disturbed. In particular, the object has recently accreted a satellite that is currently lying at a projected distance of 2 Mpc. \nThe smaller object has a temperature of about $2$--$3$ keV, corresponding to a mass of a few $10^{14}  h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. Following its cosmic evolution, we see that it will orbit on the south to the main halo with a projected impact parameter of about $500$ kpc, and will lose most of its gas content. In the cosmic time selected, the satellite and main cluster are connected by a tenuous and irregular filament with Compton parameter of $y \\sim 10^{-5}$.\n\\item A \\textit{connected} cluster pair. \nAfter the merger described above and after having stripped most of the gas of the subclump, the main halo is approached by another massive object of comparable mass. At redshift zero the two systems lie on the same plane of the sky and are about $1.5$ Mpc apart. By studying their evolutions, we observed that they are moving toward each other and in the future they will merge. At the current epoch, they are connected by a bright filament with a Compton parameter of $y \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\\item A \\textit{colliding} cluster system. \nThis system is composed of multiple objects that are all located in the plane of the sky along a large-scale filamentary structure. The main cluster is at the center of the image and has a mass of $\\mathrm{M}_{500}\\sim 10^{15} \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. It shows a prominent substructure at $\\sim$ 50 arcmin. This is the residual of a merger with two smaller groups. The violent merger with the main halo had an impact parameter of almost zero and the gas of one of the smallest systems has been completely stripped away.   The collision direction is witnessed by a prominent bow shock that is visible as a sharp SZ edge immediately to the west of the merged objects. A third cluster, connected by a filament, is located ahead of the shock outside the field of view. The snapshot shown corresponds to $z \\sim 0$, thus we cannot clearly see the future of this object. However, by looking at its past motion we presume that it will most likely produce a second major merger.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Galactic Dust and Instrumental Noise Properties Assumed at 350 GHz in the Mock HFI Frequency Maps. \\label{tab:bck_par}}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccc}\n\\tableline\\tableline\n \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Galactic}    &  Noise      & Median    &   Dust       & Median   \\\\\n \\multicolumn{2}{c}{coordinates} &  Standard   & Dust      &   Standard   & Dust to SZ   \\\\\n   $l$          &  $b$           &  Deviation  & Intensity &   Deviation & Intensity  \\\\\n   (deg)        &  (deg)         &  ($\\mu$K)   & ($\\mu$K)  &   ($\\mu$K)  & Ratio \\tablenotemark{a}  \\\\\n\\tableline\n   0& -15&   99.3&  923.6&  254.6&  8.6 \\\\\n   0& -30&   88.5&  591.8&  147.9&  5.8 \\\\\n  90& -60&   78.8&  397.0&   74.6&  3.5 \\\\\n   0& -60&   74.9&  104.8&   42.4&  1.0 \\\\\n  90& -30&   72.8&  612.1&  502.6&  6.7 \\\\\n  90& -15&   66.1& 1560.2&  422.3& 13.2 \\\\\n 270& -60&   64.3&  257.7&   70.2&  2.5 \\\\\n 270& -15&   60.8& 2229.5&  566.3& 22.4 \\\\\n 270& -30&   28.2&  550.5&  135.4&  4.7 \\\\\n\\tableline\n\\tableline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\tablecomments{Pixel areas are 1 square arcminute.

The SZ map of each cluster is also visible on the top panel of Fig. \\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_snr}. Fig. \\ref{Fig:a399_coma_vs_gadget} demonstrates, in particular, that displacing the \\textit{connected cluster} at $z=0.04$ yields an angular separation between the two cluster peaks that is comparable to the separation of both components of the cluster pair A399-A401. Moreover, displacing the  \\textit{colliding cluster} at $z=0.01$ leads to a Compton parameter decrement that matches its true analog that is measured across the most prominent shock front in Coma \\citep[see also][]{Planck_intermediate_X_coma}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Mock HFI frequency maps}\n\n\nTo emulate HFI observations of our simulated clusters, we choose a few characteristic regions of the sky in terms of thermal SZ signal-to-noise ratio and predict the 2D signal to be registered in each HFI channel by adding our tSZ maps to the expected specific intensities of the CMB and Galactic dust components. For each HFI channel and sky region, frequency maps $I(k, l, \\nu)$ are convolved with the HFI beam and added to a noise realization that matches the noise variance and power spectrum registered to the cluster scales in the raw data. The amplitude of the CMB SED is extracted from the Planck CMB map that is\nreconstructed using the Spectral Matching Independent Component Analysis (SMICA) component separation algorithm \\citep{Planck_2013_XII_components}, while the amplitude of the Galactic dust SED accommodates the dust optical depth mapped at 353 GHz as a result of the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ all-sky model of thermal dust  \\citep{Planck_2013_XI_tdustmodel}. For simplicity, a constant spectral index, $\\beta$ = 1.8, is assumed for the dust SED, consistent with the first all-sky modeling from {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ and IRAS data \\citep{Planck_early_XIX_tdustmodel}. An example of mock HFI frequency maps of the \\textit{colliding} cluster system is shown for ($l=270^\\circ$, $b=-30^\\circ$) in Fig. \\ref{Fig:HFI_freqmaps}, while a few properties of the Galactic dust and instrumental noise included in the 350 GHz maps are summarized in Tab.\\ref{tab:bck_par} for each simulated sky position. The dust intensity in particular mostly depends on the Galactic latitude, and is shown to dominate the positive side of the thermal SZ signal ($f_{\\nu} > $ 217 GHz). \n\n\n\n\\subsection{SZ Map restoration}\n\n Figures \\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_snr}--\\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_redshift} present the restoration of simulated SZ maps for a soft thresholding, \n\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\bar{\\mathscr{Wt}} = \\text{sgn}({\\mathscr{Wt}}) \\left(|{\\mathscr{Wt}}| - \\lambda\\right)_{+}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\bar{\\mathscr{Wt}}=\\text{sgn}({\\mathscr{Wt}})\\left(|{\\mathscr{Wt}}|-\\lambda%&#10;\\right)_{+}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\ud835\udcb2</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\ud835\udcc9</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mrow><mtext>sgn</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\ud835\udcb2</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\ud835\udcc9</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\ud835\udcb2</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathscript\">\ud835\udcc9</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>+</mo></msub></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06323.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n{\\textit{Effect of the instrumental noise variance.\\\\ }}\nFig. 4 shows the tSZ maps of our test clusters positioned at low redshift, in a couple of sky regions corresponding to the lowest and highest variance of the instrumental noise in Tab. 1. In this figure, all characteristic features with a typical Compton parameter of $y \\ge10^{-5}$ are bright enough to be restored. More specifically, both components of the \\textit{accreting} cluster are recovered for each sky region, though the SNR decrement makes it difficult to recover the true shape of the tenuous filament connecting the two clusters at ($l=0^{\\circ}$, $b=-15^{\\circ}$). The extended bow shock escaping from the \\textit{colliding} clusters is also detectable for each sky region, together with the filament connecting these clusters to their third companion. \\\\\n\n{\\textit{Effect of the instrumental noise variance and dust intensity.\\\\ }}\nIn Fig. 5, the tSZ signal of the \\textit{connected cluster} displaced at $z=0.04$ is mapped for the sky positions detailed in Tab. 1. The cluster system is restored with an SNR larger than 14 for each sky region. In particular, the position of the cluster peaks and the orientation of the connecting filament are preserved in any case. The image SNR turns out to be roughly correlated with the instrumental noise variance regardless of the Galactic latitude, which suggests that it essentially depends on statistics. \\\\\n\n{\\textit{Effect of the angular distance\\\\ }}\nA few tSZ maps of our test clusters that were displaced at higher redshifts are finally shown on Fig. 6. The redshift values of 0.02, 0.04 and 0.07 correspond to two successive decrements of the angular distances by a factor of two. Separated by two PSF radii, both components of the \\textit{connected} and \\textit{accreting} clusters are well-resolved even at these redshifts. The shock front is also clearly visible at $z=0.02$, while its companion filament is detected up to $z=0.04$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n  \\resizebox{.95\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{planck_gadget_f7.eps}}\n  \\caption{Radially averaged Compton parameter of a nearby sample of galaxy clusters detected with a threshold higher than $S/N=5$ in the  {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ catalog.

As shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_snr}, the situation is more critical for $y$ values that are lower than $10^{-5}$, since the restoration depends on statistics and dust emissivity for a given region of the sky. In practice, a severe detection threshold (3$\\sigma$ or more) would allow us to isolate ICM features down to $y$ values of  $5\\times10^{-6}$ in most of the sky regions, in particular when they are extended enough to be analyzed and averaged out on several PSF sizes.\n\nThough not intended to be considered as absolute limits for each specific target, these values provide us with a coarse assessment of the potential of the presented algorithm in the 2015 release of {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ data. To predict a number of appropriate targets,  we selected a sample of galaxy clusters in the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ catalog of SZ sources whose $r_{500}$ radii exceed the PSF size of each HFI frequency map, and whose detection thresholds, S/N, are higher than 5 in the sense of the Multifrequency Matched Filter detection algorithm detailed in \\citet{Melin_06}. Fig. \\ref{Fig:yszcat_profiles} exhibits the radial profiles of the $y$ parameter expected toward these clusters if one assumes a pressure structure that follows the average profile measured for a representative sample of the X-ray cluster population \\citep{Arnaud_10}. The cluster radii, $r_{500}$, and integrated-pressure, $\\mathrm{Y}_{5r_{500}}$, follow the scaling relation proposed by the Planck collaboration to constrain cluster masses from SZ measurements \\citep{Planck_2013_XX_cosmo}. The radially averaged Compton parameter exceeds $10^{-5}$ for 57 clusters at a distance from the center that exceeds the PSF size of each HFI frequency map. Lowering our selection criterion, at variance, to a $y$ parameter of $7.5\\times10^{-6}$ would yield 81 clusters for which ICM anisotropies would be detectable beyond the PSF size of each HFI frequency map. \n\nBeyond the brightest central regions of clusters, matter filaments also connect the component of cluster systems, and might become detectable at a larger radii than expected within isolated, spherically symmetric clusters. A typical sample of targets for such studies is composed of 18 pairs of clusters from the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ catalog, detected with an S/N threshold that is higher 5, showing an angular separation that is lower than $1^{\\circ}$ and a redshift interval that is lower than 0.01. \n\n\n\\section*{Conclusion}\n\n\tWe presented a multi-scale algorithm aimed at restoring the thermal SZ maps of extended galaxy clusters observed with the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ HFI bolometer arrays.

In this figure, all characteristic features with a typical Compton parameter of $y \\ge10^{-5}$ are bright enough to be restored. More specifically, both components of the \\textit{accreting} cluster are recovered for each sky region, though the SNR decrement makes it difficult to recover the true shape of the tenuous filament connecting the two clusters at ($l=0^{\\circ}$, $b=-15^{\\circ}$). The extended bow shock escaping from the \\textit{colliding} clusters is also detectable for each sky region, together with the filament connecting these clusters to their third companion. \\\\\n\n{\\textit{Effect of the instrumental noise variance and dust intensity.\\\\ }}\nIn Fig. 5, the tSZ signal of the \\textit{connected cluster} displaced at $z=0.04$ is mapped for the sky positions detailed in Tab. 1. The cluster system is restored with an SNR larger than 14 for each sky region. In particular, the position of the cluster peaks and the orientation of the connecting filament are preserved in any case. The image SNR turns out to be roughly correlated with the instrumental noise variance regardless of the Galactic latitude, which suggests that it essentially depends on statistics. \\\\\n\n{\\textit{Effect of the angular distance\\\\ }}\nA few tSZ maps of our test clusters that were displaced at higher redshifts are finally shown on Fig. 6. The redshift values of 0.02, 0.04 and 0.07 correspond to two successive decrements of the angular distances by a factor of two. Separated by two PSF radii, both components of the \\textit{connected} and \\textit{accreting} clusters are well-resolved even at these redshifts. The shock front is also clearly visible at $z=0.02$, while its companion filament is detected up to $z=0.04$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n  \\resizebox{.95\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{planck_gadget_f7.eps}}\n  \\caption{Radially averaged Compton parameter of a nearby sample of galaxy clusters detected with a threshold higher than $S/N=5$ in the  {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ catalog.

As shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig:clusters_vs_snr}, the situation is more critical for $y$ values that are lower than $10^{-5}$, since the restoration depends on statistics and dust emissivity for a given region of the sky. In practice, a severe detection threshold (3$\\sigma$ or more) would allow us to isolate ICM features down to $y$ values of  $5\\times10^{-6}$ in most of the sky regions, in particular when they are extended enough to be analyzed and averaged out on several PSF sizes.\n\nThough not intended to be considered as absolute limits for each specific target, these values provide us with a coarse assessment of the potential of the presented algorithm in the 2015 release of {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ data. To predict a number of appropriate targets,  we selected a sample of galaxy clusters in the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ catalog of SZ sources whose $r_{500}$ radii exceed the PSF size of each HFI frequency map, and whose detection thresholds, S/N, are higher than 5 in the sense of the Multifrequency Matched Filter detection algorithm detailed in \\citet{Melin_06}. Fig. \\ref{Fig:yszcat_profiles} exhibits the radial profiles of the $y$ parameter expected toward these clusters if one assumes a pressure structure that follows the average profile measured for a representative sample of the X-ray cluster population \\citep{Arnaud_10}. The cluster radii, $r_{500}$, and integrated-pressure, $\\mathrm{Y}_{5r_{500}}$, follow the scaling relation proposed by the Planck collaboration to constrain cluster masses from SZ measurements \\citep{Planck_2013_XX_cosmo}. The radially averaged Compton parameter exceeds $10^{-5}$ for 57 clusters at a distance from the center that exceeds the PSF size of each HFI frequency map. Lowering our selection criterion, at variance, to a $y$ parameter of $7.5\\times10^{-6}$ would yield 81 clusters for which ICM anisotropies would be detectable beyond the PSF size of each HFI frequency map. \n\nBeyond the brightest central regions of clusters, matter filaments also connect the component of cluster systems, and might become detectable at a larger radii than expected within isolated, spherically symmetric clusters. A typical sample of targets for such studies is composed of 18 pairs of clusters from the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ catalog, detected with an S/N threshold that is higher 5, showing an angular separation that is lower than $1^{\\circ}$ and a redshift interval that is lower than 0.01. \n\n\n\\section*{Conclusion}\n\n\tWe presented a multi-scale algorithm aimed at restoring the thermal SZ maps of extended galaxy clusters observed with the {\\textit{Planck}{}}~ HFI bolometer arrays.
