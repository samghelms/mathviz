In addition to the positional centroids, 24{$\\mu$m}\\ photometry, and quality flags,  the table \nalso includes photometry from the nearest entry in the 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and WISE catalogs if the source positions from  these \ncatalogs fall within 2\\arcsec\\ of the MIPSGAL positional centroid. \nThe availability of source fluxes from the near to mid-infrared bands allows one to identify candidate young stellar objects based on the \nshape of the spectral energy distribution between 1-25{$\\mu$m}. \nIn this study, we are interested in the early \nstage YSOs that should still be located within the clumps from which they formed.  \nSuch early stage YSOs exhibit rising spectral energy distributions \nthrough the mid-IR bands \n(Class~I)\n\\citep{Lada:1992}.\n\nUsing the infrared color criteria for Class~I or \ndeeply embedded protostars \ndescribed by \\citet{Gutermuth:2009}, 13406 candidate early-stage YSOs \nare selected from the MIPSGAL catalog with $|l|< 60$ and $|b|<1$.  \nA fraction of these candidate YSO sources could be AGB stars, which exhibit similar colors as early stage YSOs.  \n\\citet{Robitaille:2008} estimated \n30-50\\% of the GLIMPSE-based red sources are AGB stars and proposed a magnitude and color threshold\nto distinguish between AGB stars and YSOs. \n\n In this study, we do not directly apply this \ncolor-magnitude cut since we are interested in the angular coincidence between \nATLASGAL clumps and YSOs.  It is \npossible, yet unlikely, that AGB stars are aligned with the small area subtended by such clumps.   \nNevertheless, an examination of the photometry \nfor the selected sources satisfies these magnitude and color requirements. \n\n\\subsection{Selection biases}\nTo address the biases generated by the respective selection requirements for ATLASGAL clumps and MIPSGAL YSOs, \nwe\ncompare our ATLASGAL sample and YSO populations to those used in previous studies.  \\citet{Urquhart:2014b} \ncompiled a complete sample of massive star forming clumps in the Galaxy by matching sources within \nthe ATLASGAL \ncatalog to various tracers of massive star formation.  These tracers include the Red MSX Source (RMS) Survey \\citep{Lumsden:2013}, \nthe Methonal Multibeam (MMB) Survey \\citep{Green:2009}, and compact HII regions extracted \nfrom the Cornish Survey \\citep{Purcell:2013}.  \nCross linking our sample of 3494 ATLASGAL clumps with those associated with these signatures of massive \nstar formation,\nwe find the following matched fractions: 23/329 (7\\%) to RMS, 63/529 (12\\%) to MMB, and \n21/556 (4\\%) to compact HII regions.   The low overlap fraction arises from both saturation within the \nMIPSGAL images and bright backgrounds in the vicinity of massive stars.  Specifically, 43\\%, 42\\%, and 58\\% of \nthe ATLASGAL sources examined by \\citet{Urquhart:2014b} are discarded in our study \n due to saturated pixels at 24{$\\mu$m}\\ for RMS, MMB, and compact HII regions \nrespectively.  Similarly, 50\\%, 46\\%, and 38\\% are removed from our sample of clumps owing to \nthe source completeness requirement. \nThe requirements imposed on our sample of ATLASGAL clumps introduces a bias that mostly excludes sites\nof massive star formation \nas traced by the RMS, MMB, and compact HII region CORNISH catalogs. \n\n\\citet{Robitaille:2008} constructed a list of 18337 red infrared objects based on the color selection [4.5]-[8.0] $>$ 1\nfor sources with $\\sim$6:1 signal to noise in these bands.  These red objects are comprised of unresolved planetary nebulae, \nAGB stars, YSOs, and background galaxies.  Using targeted MIPSGAL 24{$\\mu$m}\\ photometry on these sources, they further refined \ntheir sample of YSOs based on [4.5]$>$ 7.8 and [8.0]-[24] $\\ge$ 2.5. From these cuts, they estimate a total of 11473 YSOs.  \nWithin this sample, 2184 do not have 24{$\\mu$m}\\ photometry owing to bright background or local saturation of the \nMips detectors. \n\nThe candidate YSOs derived \nfrom the MIPSGAL catalog are matched to  2744 (23\\%) of the Glimpse-based YSOs.  If we impose the same IRAC \nselection criteria used by \\citet{Robitaille:2008},\nonly 4318 of the MIPSGAL-based YSOs would have been selected by \\citet{Robitaille:2008}.  From this subset, 2739 (63\\%) match the YSO list of \\citet{Robitaille:2008}.  \nHowever, the YSOs identified by \\citet{Robitaille:2008} include both early and intermediate stage systems. \nWe have classified the \\citet{Robitaille:2008} sample using the \\citet{Gutermuth:2009} criteria \nassuming 10:1 signal to noise ratio in the MIPSGAL fluxes (not tabulated in the \\citet{Robitaille:2008} table).\nThis classification results in 3887 Class~I, 39 deeply embedded, and \n4193 Class 2 objects.  Of the 3926 Class~I and deeply embedded set, 59\\% are matched to the YSO sample in \nthis study. \nWhen analyzed self-consistently, \nthere is $\\sim$60\\% overlap between the Class~I/embedded MIPSGAL-based sample of YSOs and those \nof \\citet{Robitaille:2008}. \nA large number (11091) of early stage MIPSGAL YSOs \nare not matched to the GLIMPSE-based YSO sample. \nThis mismatch suggests that the YSOs keyed \non 24{$\\mu$m}\\ detection represent a different population of YSOs than those defined \nby \\citet{Robitaille:2008}.  This population is likely to be more deeply embedded within the dense clump from which it \ncondensed and therefore, represents an earlier stage of YSO evolution. \n\n\\section{Linking young stellar objects to ATLASGAL clumps}\nTo evaluate the star formation activity within this sample of clumps, it is \nnecessary to associate early-stage YSOs to ATLASGAL sources. \nA candidate YSO is linked to an ATLASGAL clump if its l,b coordinate lies within the solid angle of the clump as \ndefined by its SExtractor mask.  A YSO located just outside of the mask area is not considered to be resident \nwithin the clump but may represent a later stage of YSO evolution. \nMore than one YSO may be linked to a single clump.   Examples of a star-forming clump and a non star-forming, \nquiescent clump, in which no YSO is linked, are \nshown in Figure~\\ref{link_examples}.   In many cases, a MIPSGAL point source is coincident with an ATLASGAL clump\nbut its infrared colors are consistent with a main-sequence star.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{link_examples.eps}\n\\caption{\n(left) Star forming ATLASGAL clump, AGAL007.166+00.131, associated with a MIPSGAL selected YSO.

The faint 24{$\\mu$m}\\ source projected onto the \ndust emission is not identified as a YSO. \n}\n\\label{link_examples}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe fraction of star-forming clumps, $f_*=N_*/N_T$, is 0.23, where \n$N_*$ is the number of ATLASGAL clumps with at least one early-stage YSO and $N_T$=3494, is \nthe total number clumps in the sample.\nThis fraction does not significantly change if the completeness \nlimit requirement is relaxed such that all 8007 ATLASGAL clumps within the searched \narea with no saturated pixels are examined.  In this case, 22\\% of the\n ATLASGAL clumps are associated with a \nMIPSGAL YSO.  While more star forming clumps are identified within this larger sample, the added ATLASGAL \nsources with brighter backgrounds (higher values of $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$) preclude \ndetections of fainter YSOs.  To maintain a well-defined sample, we only consider the 3494 \nclumps with the imposed background flux limit. \n\nThe offset, ${\\Delta}r$, between the YSO position and the position of \npeak 870{$\\mu$m}\\ \nintensity is calculated for each star forming clump.  This offset is \nnormalized by the clump radius.  The distribution of normalized \noffsets is strongly peaked between 0 and 0.1 and\naffirms the early-stage status\nof YSOs linked to these clumps. \n\nSeveral previous studies have examined the fraction of star forming ATLASGAL clumps using other star forming tracers. \n\\citet{Contreras:2013} used mid infrared, color-selected data from the MSX mission and found a fraction of star forming clumps of \n40\\% over the longitude range 330 $< l <$ 21.  \\citet{Csengeri:2014} compiled a list of compact ATLASGAL \nsources and linked both WISE and MSX based protostars based on angular proximity to the dust peak. \nThey found 30\\% of the compact clumps were linked to YSOs identified within the WISE source catalog with colors \nsimilar to those used in this study and 33\\% of star-forming clumps when including MSX sources in regions where WISE \nsaturates.\n\nThe discrepancy between the fraction of star-forming clumps found in these \nearlier studies and this MIPSGAL \nbased study, lies primarily in the sample of 1487 ATLASGAL clumps discarded due to saturation \nin the 24{$\\mu$m}\\ band.  Figure~\\ref{atlasgal_sources_select}\nshows the cumulative distributions of peak and integrated flux densities \nfor ATLASGAL sources with 24{$\\mu$m}\\ saturation (dotted line), \nwith bright backgrounds $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$ greater than 0.072~Jy (dashed line), \nand \nwith $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$ less than 0.072~Jy (solid line).\nClumps with 24{$\\mu$m}\\ saturation have larger 870{$\\mu$m}\\ peak flux densities \nthan the other groups.  \\citet{Csengeri:2014} demonstrate that clumps with large peak flux densities have a higher \nprobability of being associated with star formation activity.  The number of \nclumps discarded due to saturation that may be linked to YSOs, $N_{*,c}$, is estimated by the integral \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 11251, "prevtext": " \n\n\n   \\title{The rate and latency of star formation in dense, massive clumps \nin the Milky Way\n\\footnote{Tables 2,3 and 4 are only available in electronic form\nat the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5)\nor via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/}\n}\n   \\titlerunning{Rate and Latency of Star Formation}\n\n\n\n   \\author{M.Heyer  \n          \\inst{1,2}\n          \\and\n          R.

Single, newborn \nstars emerge from these localized cores \nwhile young stellar clusters are \ngenerated if the clump itself is gravitationally unstable \\citep{Bate:2003,Vazquez:2009}.\nUnderstanding how each step in this sequence limits the \nrate and yield of newborn stars is a key requirement to the development \nof a complete and predictive description of star formation in galaxies. \nIn this study, we address whether star formation \nis regulated by global, galaxy-wide processes, or by the local conditions \nof the gas from which stars condense. \n\nSeveral recent studies have addressed this issue using data that spans \na large range in spatial scales and environmental conditions\n\\citep{Krumholz:2012, Federrath:2013,Salim:2015}.\n\\citet{Krumholz:2012} analyzed star formation rates and molecular gas \nproperties for molecular clouds in the solar neighborhood, Local group \ngalaxies, unresolved disks, \nand starburst galaxies \nin the local and high-redshift \nuniverse.  With these data, they evaluated several \nproposed star \nformation relationships that describe the variation of star formation rates with \nthe amount of gas processed over key timescales, such as the orbital period \nand free-fall time.  The volumetric law, expressed as \n$\\Sigma_{SFR}=\\epsilon_{ff} \\Sigma_{H2}/\\tau_{ff}$, \nwhere \n$\\Sigma_{H2}$ is the molecular gas surface density, $\\tau_{ff}$ is the free-fall time, and \n$\\epsilon_{ff}$ is the star formation efficiency per free-fall time, \nprovided the best fit to the full range of data for \n$\\epsilon_{ff}$=0.01.  This value for the efficiency is supported by theoretical estimates\n\\citep{Krumholz:2005, Padoan:2012}. \n\n\\citet{Evans:2014} examined a more recent compilation of young \nstellar objects within the Gould's Belt star forming regions.\nThey identified a linear relationship between the star formation rate and the amount of dense gas mass that is consistent with a threshold for star formation, \n$\\Sigma_{SFR}=f_{dense}\\Sigma_{H2}/\\tau_{dense}$,\nwhere $f_{dense}$ is the fraction of dense gas within a molecular cloud,\nand $\\tau_{dense}$ is a characteristic timescale for this dense gas.\nMoreover, they found no correlation between the star formation rate and \nmass for cloud extinctions greater than 2 magnitudes and no correspondance \nwith the volumetric law. \n\nIn this study, we investigate the star formation rates and gas properties\nof \nhigh density clumps embedded within molecular clouds distributed \nthroughout the Milky Way.   \nThese data extend the number and environment \nof resolved, Galactic star forming regions with which to evaluate the star formation laws. \nThe ratio of star forming to quiescent clumps is determined to estimate the time required for a \ntypical clump to initiate star formation. \n\n\n\\section{Data and source selection}\nWe exploit the \ninformation within two surveys of the Galactic plane -- the\nAPEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy, (ATLASGAL) \\citep{Schuller:2009, Csengeri:2014} \nand the Spitzer MIPSGAL survey \nof 24{$\\mu$m}\\ emission \\citep{Carey:2009}.  These surveys respectively trace the location and properties of dense clumps and \ncolor-selected young stellar \nobjects in the Milky Way.\nATLASGAL imaged the 870{$\\mu$m}\\\nthermal dust continuum emission over longitudes 60{$^{\\circ}$}\\ $ > l > $ 280{$^{\\circ}$}\\  \nand latitudes $|b| < 1.5${$^{\\circ}$}\\ with more extended latitude coverage, -2 $< b <$ +1 between \n280{$^{\\circ}$}\\ and 300{$^{\\circ}$}. The angular resolution of the survey is 19.2\\arcsec\\ and the surface brightness sensitivity \nis typically 70~mJy/beam.  Two source catalogs have been constructed from the ATLASGAL image data. \n\\citet{Csengeri:2014} tabulated a list of compact objects based on the Gaussclump decomposition algorithm \nwhich samples localized emission peaks \\citep{Stutzki:1990}. \n\\citet{Urquhart:2014a} applied the  \nthe SExtractor algorithm to define spatially connected structures \\citep{Bertin:1996}.  Such objects are \ngenerally more extended and circumscribe the localized emission peaks.  In this study, we \nuse the \\citet{Urquhart:2014a} catalog, which includes a\nset of mask images \nthat define the set of pixels tagged to each ATLASGAL source. \n\nThe MIPSGAL Survey is a Legacy Program of the Spitzer Space Telescope that imaged the 24 and 70{$\\mu$m}\\ emission along the Galactic \nplane over the areas -68{$^{\\circ}$}\\ $< l <$ 69{$^{\\circ}$}, $|b| <$ 1{$^{\\circ}$} and -8{$^{\\circ}$} $< l <$ 9{$^{\\circ}$}, $< |b| <$ 3{$^{\\circ}$}\\ to a sensitivity depth of 1~mJy\n\\citep{Carey:2009}.  \\citet{Gutermuth:2015} constructed a 24{$\\mu$m}\\ point source catalog from the MIPSGAL images as well as a lower signal to noise\narchive set of point sources.  \nHere, we restrict our analysis to the more reliable set of catalog sources.  \nOwing to limited sensitivity in the MIPS detectors, the catalog does not include 70{$\\mu$m}\\ photometry. \nAn auxilary data product of the MIPSGAL source catalog used in this study is the set of \ndifferential completeness decay data cubes for each image tile that tabulate the \npoint source detection completeness within 1 arcmin$^2$ pixels \nas functions of flux and position given the local background \\citep{Gutermuth:2015}. \n\n\\subsection{Selecting ATLASGAL sources}\nWe examine dust sources (hereafter, clumps) from ATLASGAL within the Galactic longitudes \n60{$^{\\circ}$}\\ $> l >$ 300{$^{\\circ}$}\\\nand \nlatitudes, $|b|<$ 1{$^{\\circ}$}. \nThere are 9494 ATLASGAL sources located within these boundaries.\n\nThe effects of saturation and a spatially varying background within the MIPSGAL images \nmust be considered when \nevaluating star formation activity within a clump.  \nDepending on the local background level, the Mips 24{$\\mu$m}\\ detectors saturate for points sources with flux $\\sim>$2~Jy. \nThe MIPSGAL source catalog constructed by \\citet{Gutermuth:2015} excludes \nsuch positions from analysis \nand flags these locations within the differential completeness decay data cubes.  \nAny ATLASGAL clump whose solid angle \nsubtends any flagged, saturated MIPSGAL pixel is excluded from our analysis.  \nOf the original sample of 9494 ATLASGAL clumps, \n1487 overlap with \nsaturated MIPSGAL pixels and are removed from the clump list. \n\nThe second consideration in our selection of ATLASGAL clumps is source completeness. \nThe 24{$\\mu$m}\\ background measured by MIPSGAL exhibits large spatial variations \nthroughout the Galactic plane.  This variation arises from \nextended nebulosity excited by ultraviolet radiation that heats interstellar dust grains, which cool by reradiating \nthis energy in the mid and far infrared wavelength bands.  The effect of this background is to \nreduce the local sensitivity to faint 24{$\\mu$m}\\ point sources.  As ATLASGAL clumps can be embedded within such nebulosity, \nthe corresponding sensitivity to associated YSOs within the projected clump area is variable across the Galactic plane. \nTo characterize the 24{$\\mu$m}\\ background within an ATLASGAL clump and the sensitivity to point sources within its \narea, we define \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n<\\phi_{24,90}>=\\frac{\\int \\phi_{24,90} d\\Omega}{\\int d\\Omega}, \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"&lt;\\phi_{24,90}&gt;=\\frac{\\int\\phi_{24,90}d\\Omega}{\\int d\\Omega},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>&lt;</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mn>24</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>90</mn></mrow></msub><mo>\u2265</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mn>24</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>90</mn></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06875.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $P(S_{peak})$ is the probability of a star-forming core within bins of the peak flux density (see Figure~18 in \n\\citet{Csengeri:2014}). \nA corrected value for $f_{*,c}$ that accounts for star formation in these saturated zones is \n$f_{*,c}=\\frac{(791+755)}{(3494+1487)}$ = 0.31.

The set of 20,700 models span a range of stellar mass, radius, and surface temperature,\naccretion rates from the disk and envelope, \nand different stages of protostellar evolution.  \nFor each model, spectral energy distributions are calculated for 10 inclination angles relative to the disk axis. \nThe model SEDs \nare convolved to commonly used filter response functions to generate broadband fluxes within \n50 different sized apertures for each inclination angle at a fixed distance of 1~kpc. In our analysis, \nwe only consider model photometry in the largest aperture of 100,000 AU.  Using somewhat smaller apertures ($>$20,000 AU)\nprovided by \\citet{Robitaille:2006} did not affect our results. \n\nThe YSO model broad band fluxes are used to \ndetermine early-stage Class~I, Class~II, and late-stage, Class~III objects as applied to the MIPSGAL \ndata in \\S2.2.  \\citet{Robitaille:2006, Robitaille:2008} \ndefine 3 stages of YSO evolution based on the envelope and disk accretion rates relative to the stellar mass:\nStage~1 has $\\dot{M}_{env}/M_* > 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$; \nStage~2 has $\\dot{M}_{env}/M_* < 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ and ${M}_{disk}/M_* > 10^{-6}$;\nStage~3 has $\\dot{M}_{env}/M_* < 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ and ${M}_{disk}/M_* < 10^{-6}$. \nTable~\\ref{table1} shows the number of models in each YSO Stage that are classified as \nClass~I, Class~II, and Class~III spectral energy distributions.\nModel YSOs that are classified as Class~I objects are \nprimarily linked to Stage~1 YSO models.  \nHowever, a significant number of Stage~1 model YSOs \nare classified as Class~2 objects (37\\%).   These Stage~1 models exhibit blue infrared colors and follow \nthe locus of Stage 2 sources within a plot of IR spectral index and disk accretion date illustrated \nin Figure~11 of \\citet{Robitaille:2006}. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Protostellar stage vs color-based classification of \\citet{Robitaille:2006} models\n}     \n\\label{table1}      \n\\centering         \n\\begin{tabular}{c c c c}  \n\\hline\\hline              \n &  Stage 1 & Stage 2 & Stage 3 \\\\   \n\\hline                        \nClass I          & 54253  & 8055  & 639 \\\\   \nClass II         & 33940  & 52225 & 7804 \\\\\nClass III        &   72 & 3399 &  12784 \\\\\n\\hline                      \n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\nThe sensitivity of our YSO sample to stellar mass can be partially \nconstrained by examining the \ndistribution of 24{$\\mu$m}\\ flux density values.

A significant \nfraction of the protostellar \nbolometric luminosity is emitted at wavelengths longer than 50{$\\mu$m}. \nSince the YSO photometry from the MIPSGAL catalog \nis limited to wavelengths less than 25{$\\mu$m}, we restrict our analysis to the mid-infrared luminosity, $L_{IR}$, \nbetween 2 and 24{$\\mu$m}\\ from the available 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and MIPSGAL photometry. \nFigure~\\ref{lbol_yso_mc} shows the variation of \n$L_{IR}$, with \ncentral, stellar mass, $M_{Rob06}$, \nas a 2D-histogram, $\\zeta(M,L_{IR})$, for all models identified as Class~I objects with model disk accretion rates \nin the range,\n$10^{-8} < \\dot{M}_{disk} < 10^{-5}$ $M_\\odot yr^{-1}$ and integrated over all incidence angles.\nThe adopted range of $\\dot{M}_{disk}$ is taken from recent observational \nstudies of pre main sequence \nevolution that derive a comparable range of mass accretion rates for Class~I objects \\citep{Garatti:2012, Antoniucci:2014}. \nFor a given central, stellar mass, there is a large spread of $L_{IR}$ values  \nreflecting the varying \ndisk accretion rates and range of model time-steps.  \n\nDistances are available for 510 of the ATLASGAL clumps from \nthe study by \\citet{Wienen:2015} or cross-linking ATLASGAL sources with Bolocam Galactic plane dust sources with distances \n\\citep{Ellsworth-Bowers:2015}.  For the \\citet{Wienen:2015} sample, the measured velocity and positions \nand near/far side assignment for a given clump \nwere used to derive a distance using the \\citet{Reid:2009} rotation curve.\nOf this sample, there are 219 star forming clumps which are associated with \n290 Class~I YSOs.   The median distance for all clumps in our sample is 3.9~kpc.

The largest \nsource of luminosity error is due to the distance measurement rather than photometric uncertainties. \nThe fractional distance errors, $\\sigma_D/D$, for the ATLASGAL sources range from 0.1 to 1\n\\citep{Wienen:2015, Ellsworth-Bowers:2015}. \nThe cumulative probability distribution, $P(M,L_{IR}|L_*)$ is constructed \nfrom $\\zeta(M,L_{IR})$ for this set of Class I models,\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 22087, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\phi_{24,90}$ is the interpolated value from the differential completeness decay cubes to 90\\% and \nthe integral is over the solid angle of the ATLASGAL source.\nFigure~\\ref{d90} shows the distribution \nof $<\\phi_{24,90}>$ for 8007 ATLASGAL clumps without 24{$\\mu$m}\\ saturation.\nTo establish a base sensitivity to YSOs for all ATLASGAL clumps, a source completeness requirement is imposed such that \n$<\\phi_{24,90}>$ is less than 72~mJy ([24]=5). \nThis limit enables our analysis to be \nat least 90\\% complete to protostars with mass greater than 2~{M$_\\odot$}\\ at a distance of 3.9~kpc \n(see Section~4).\n A total of 3494 ATLASGAL sources satisfy this requirement \nand comprise our final sample of clumps.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{d90.eps}\n\\caption{Distribution of $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$ values for ATLASGAL clumps with $|b| <$ 1{$^{\\circ}$}\\ and containing no \nsaturated pixels at 24{$\\mu$m}.  \nThe vertical dotted line marks the maximum value of $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$ that defines the clump sample\nand reflects the flux at which the MIPSGAL source catalog is at least 90\\% complete in these areas. \n}\n\\label{d90}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Selecting young stellar objects from MIPSGAL}\nThe \\citet{Gutermuth:2015} MIPSGAL source catalog is a compilation of point sources extracted from 24{$\\mu$m}\\ image product.  In addition to the positional centroids, 24{$\\mu$m}\\ photometry, and quality flags,  the table \nalso includes photometry from the nearest entry in the 2MASS, GLIMPSE, and WISE catalogs if the source positions from  these \ncatalogs fall within 2\\arcsec\\ of the MIPSGAL positional centroid. \nThe availability of source fluxes from the near to mid-infrared bands allows one to identify candidate young stellar objects based on the \nshape of the spectral energy distribution between 1-25{$\\mu$m}. \nIn this study, we are interested in the early \nstage YSOs that should still be located within the clumps from which they formed.  \nSuch early stage YSOs exhibit rising spectral energy distributions \nthrough the mid-IR bands \n(Class~I)\n\\citep{Lada:1992}.\n\nUsing the infrared color criteria for Class~I or \ndeeply embedded protostars \ndescribed by \\citet{Gutermuth:2009}, 13406 candidate early-stage YSOs \nare selected from the MIPSGAL catalog with $|l|< 60$ and $|b|<1$.  \nA fraction of these candidate YSO sources could be AGB stars, which exhibit similar colors as early stage YSOs.  \n\\citet{Robitaille:2008} estimated \n30-50\\% of the GLIMPSE-based red sources are AGB stars and proposed a magnitude and color threshold\nto distinguish between AGB stars and YSOs. \n\n In this study, we do not directly apply this \ncolor-magnitude cut since we are interested in the angular coincidence between \nATLASGAL clumps and YSOs.  It is \npossible, yet unlikely, that AGB stars are aligned with the small area subtended by such clumps.   \nNevertheless, an examination of the photometry \nfor the selected sources satisfies these magnitude and color requirements. \n\n\\subsection{Selection biases}\nTo address the biases generated by the respective selection requirements for ATLASGAL clumps and MIPSGAL YSOs, \nwe\ncompare our ATLASGAL sample and YSO populations to those used in previous studies.  \\citet{Urquhart:2014b} \ncompiled a complete sample of massive star forming clumps in the Galaxy by matching sources within \nthe ATLASGAL \ncatalog to various tracers of massive star formation.  These tracers include the Red MSX Source (RMS) Survey \\citep{Lumsden:2013}, \nthe Methonal Multibeam (MMB) Survey \\citep{Green:2009}, and compact HII regions extracted \nfrom the Cornish Survey \\citep{Purcell:2013}.  \nCross linking our sample of 3494 ATLASGAL clumps with those associated with these signatures of massive \nstar formation,\nwe find the following matched fractions: 23/329 (7\\%) to RMS, 63/529 (12\\%) to MMB, and \n21/556 (4\\%) to compact HII regions.   The low overlap fraction arises from both saturation within the \nMIPSGAL images and bright backgrounds in the vicinity of massive stars.  Specifically, 43\\%, 42\\%, and 58\\% of \nthe ATLASGAL sources examined by \\citet{Urquhart:2014b} are discarded in our study \n due to saturated pixels at 24{$\\mu$m}\\ for RMS, MMB, and compact HII regions \nrespectively.  Similarly, 50\\%, 46\\%, and 38\\% are removed from our sample of clumps owing to \nthe source completeness requirement. \nThe requirements imposed on our sample of ATLASGAL clumps introduces a bias that mostly excludes sites\nof massive star formation \nas traced by the RMS, MMB, and compact HII region CORNISH catalogs. \n\n\\citet{Robitaille:2008} constructed a list of 18337 red infrared objects based on the color selection [4.5]-[8.0] $>$ 1\nfor sources with $\\sim$6:1 signal to noise in these bands.  These red objects are comprised of unresolved planetary nebulae, \nAGB stars, YSOs, and background galaxies.  Using targeted MIPSGAL 24{$\\mu$m}\\ photometry on these sources, they further refined \ntheir sample of YSOs based on [4.5]$>$ 7.8 and [8.0]-[24] $\\ge$ 2.5. From these cuts, they estimate a total of 11473 YSOs.  \nWithin this sample, 2184 do not have 24{$\\mu$m}\\ photometry owing to bright background or local saturation of the \nMips detectors. \n\nThe candidate YSOs derived \nfrom the MIPSGAL catalog are matched to  2744 (23\\%) of the Glimpse-based YSOs.  If we impose the same IRAC \nselection criteria used by \\citet{Robitaille:2008},\nonly 4318 of the MIPSGAL-based YSOs would have been selected by \\citet{Robitaille:2008}.  From this subset, 2739 (63\\%) match the YSO list of \\citet{Robitaille:2008}.  \nHowever, the YSOs identified by \\citet{Robitaille:2008} include both early and intermediate stage systems. \nWe have classified the \\citet{Robitaille:2008} sample using the \\citet{Gutermuth:2009} criteria \nassuming 10:1 signal to noise ratio in the MIPSGAL fluxes (not tabulated in the \\citet{Robitaille:2008} table).\nThis classification results in 3887 Class~I, 39 deeply embedded, and \n4193 Class 2 objects.  Of the 3926 Class~I and deeply embedded set, 59\\% are matched to the YSO sample in \nthis study. \nWhen analyzed self-consistently, \nthere is $\\sim$60\\% overlap between the Class~I/embedded MIPSGAL-based sample of YSOs and those \nof \\citet{Robitaille:2008}. \nA large number (11091) of early stage MIPSGAL YSOs \nare not matched to the GLIMPSE-based YSO sample. \nThis mismatch suggests that the YSOs keyed \non 24{$\\mu$m}\\ detection represent a different population of YSOs than those defined \nby \\citet{Robitaille:2008}.  This population is likely to be more deeply embedded within the dense clump from which it \ncondensed and therefore, represents an earlier stage of YSO evolution. \n\n\\section{Linking young stellar objects to ATLASGAL clumps}\nTo evaluate the star formation activity within this sample of clumps, it is \nnecessary to associate early-stage YSOs to ATLASGAL sources. \nA candidate YSO is linked to an ATLASGAL clump if its l,b coordinate lies within the solid angle of the clump as \ndefined by its SExtractor mask.  A YSO located just outside of the mask area is not considered to be resident \nwithin the clump but may represent a later stage of YSO evolution. \nMore than one YSO may be linked to a single clump.   Examples of a star-forming clump and a non star-forming, \nquiescent clump, in which no YSO is linked, are \nshown in Figure~\\ref{link_examples}.   In many cases, a MIPSGAL point source is coincident with an ATLASGAL clump\nbut its infrared colors are consistent with a main-sequence star.  \n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\hsize]{link_examples.eps}\n\\caption{\n(left) Star forming ATLASGAL clump, AGAL007.166+00.131, associated with a MIPSGAL selected YSO.

The faint 24{$\\mu$m}\\ source projected onto the \ndust emission is not identified as a YSO. \n}\n\\label{link_examples}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe fraction of star-forming clumps, $f_*=N_*/N_T$, is 0.23, where \n$N_*$ is the number of ATLASGAL clumps with at least one early-stage YSO and $N_T$=3494, is \nthe total number clumps in the sample.\nThis fraction does not significantly change if the completeness \nlimit requirement is relaxed such that all 8007 ATLASGAL clumps within the searched \narea with no saturated pixels are examined.  In this case, 22\\% of the\n ATLASGAL clumps are associated with a \nMIPSGAL YSO.  While more star forming clumps are identified within this larger sample, the added ATLASGAL \nsources with brighter backgrounds (higher values of $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$) preclude \ndetections of fainter YSOs.  To maintain a well-defined sample, we only consider the 3494 \nclumps with the imposed background flux limit. \n\nThe offset, ${\\Delta}r$, between the YSO position and the position of \npeak 870{$\\mu$m}\\ \nintensity is calculated for each star forming clump.  This offset is \nnormalized by the clump radius.  The distribution of normalized \noffsets is strongly peaked between 0 and 0.1 and\naffirms the early-stage status\nof YSOs linked to these clumps. \n\nSeveral previous studies have examined the fraction of star forming ATLASGAL clumps using other star forming tracers. \n\\citet{Contreras:2013} used mid infrared, color-selected data from the MSX mission and found a fraction of star forming clumps of \n40\\% over the longitude range 330 $< l <$ 21.  \\citet{Csengeri:2014} compiled a list of compact ATLASGAL \nsources and linked both WISE and MSX based protostars based on angular proximity to the dust peak. \nThey found 30\\% of the compact clumps were linked to YSOs identified within the WISE source catalog with colors \nsimilar to those used in this study and 33\\% of star-forming clumps when including MSX sources in regions where WISE \nsaturates.\n\nThe discrepancy between the fraction of star-forming clumps found in these \nearlier studies and this MIPSGAL \nbased study, lies primarily in the sample of 1487 ATLASGAL clumps discarded due to saturation \nin the 24{$\\mu$m}\\ band.  Figure~\\ref{atlasgal_sources_select}\nshows the cumulative distributions of peak and integrated flux densities \nfor ATLASGAL sources with 24{$\\mu$m}\\ saturation (dotted line), \nwith bright backgrounds $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$ greater than 0.072~Jy (dashed line), \nand \nwith $<\\Phi_{24,90}>$ less than 0.072~Jy (solid line).\nClumps with 24{$\\mu$m}\\ saturation have larger 870{$\\mu$m}\\ peak flux densities \nthan the other groups.  \\citet{Csengeri:2014} demonstrate that clumps with large peak flux densities have a higher \nprobability of being associated with star formation activity.

The set of 20,700 models span a range of stellar mass, radius, and surface temperature,\naccretion rates from the disk and envelope, \nand different stages of protostellar evolution.  \nFor each model, spectral energy distributions are calculated for 10 inclination angles relative to the disk axis. \nThe model SEDs \nare convolved to commonly used filter response functions to generate broadband fluxes within \n50 different sized apertures for each inclination angle at a fixed distance of 1~kpc. In our analysis, \nwe only consider model photometry in the largest aperture of 100,000 AU.  Using somewhat smaller apertures ($>$20,000 AU)\nprovided by \\citet{Robitaille:2006} did not affect our results. \n\nThe YSO model broad band fluxes are used to \ndetermine early-stage Class~I, Class~II, and late-stage, Class~III objects as applied to the MIPSGAL \ndata in \\S2.2.  \\citet{Robitaille:2006, Robitaille:2008} \ndefine 3 stages of YSO evolution based on the envelope and disk accretion rates relative to the stellar mass:\nStage~1 has $\\dot{M}_{env}/M_* > 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$; \nStage~2 has $\\dot{M}_{env}/M_* < 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ and ${M}_{disk}/M_* > 10^{-6}$;\nStage~3 has $\\dot{M}_{env}/M_* < 10^{-6}$ yr$^{-1}$ and ${M}_{disk}/M_* < 10^{-6}$. \nTable~\\ref{table1} shows the number of models in each YSO Stage that are classified as \nClass~I, Class~II, and Class~III spectral energy distributions.\nModel YSOs that are classified as Class~I objects are \nprimarily linked to Stage~1 YSO models.  \nHowever, a significant number of Stage~1 model YSOs \nare classified as Class~2 objects (37\\%).

Earlier studies \nconnecting embedded protostars from the IRAS Point Source Catalog to dense core regions\nidentified by NH$_3$ (1,1) or (2,2) line emission, found values of f$_*$ from 33-45\\% \\citep{Beichman:1986, Bourke:1995}.\nLess obscured T Tauri-like YSOs are linked to 1/3 of the dense cores examined by \\citet{Beichman:1986} \nindicating that star formation may have \nstarted at an earlier stage of the core lifetime.  \n\nWe can \nnot ignore the possibility that clumps without a MIPSGAL YSO may in fact\nharbor faint or highly obscured YSOs with fluxes below the local, \nsensitivity limit.

In this picture, the production \nof newborn stars begins \nvery early within dense substructures so most or all clumps with high density contrast with \nrespect to the cloud should contain \none or more recently formed stars within several free-fall times.

Adding these short-lived \nclumps to the population of clumps that do evolve to form stars violates our assumption of random \nsampling of clumps with mean lifetime, $\\tau_{cl}$, and biases our measure of $f_*$ to lower values.\nFurthermore, the clump lifetimes themselves could be much smaller than the lifetime \nof the overlying cloud \\citep{Heyer:2015}. \nIf $\\tau_{SF}=2\\tau_{ff}$, as implied by rapid star formation descriptions, then \nthe measured value of $f_{*,c}$ implies a mean clump lifetime of $\\sim$6.5$\\tau_{ff}$.\nFinally, if the earliest stars that \nform have low mass ($<$ 2~{M$_\\odot$}) and therefore, are not detected \nby MIPSGAL, then $f_*$ is underestimated.  \nSuch a skewed YSO mass distribution in the earliest stages of a clump may be \nan essential requirement \nfor the development of more massive stars \\citep{Krumholz:2008}. \nThe low mass stars generated in the inital stages of the clump provide a local \nheating source \nto the gas, which \nsuppresses fragmentation and enables the collapse of more massive and dense sub-structures\nthat ultimately form high mass stars. \n\n\\subsection{ATLASGAL clumps in the context of star formation laws} \nThe data compiled in the previous sections enable an examination of the \nproposed star formation laws within the dense gas regime of the ATLASGAL clumps distributed \nthroughout the Milky Way.\nPrevious studies have considered star forming regions within 1~kpc of the Sun that are limited in \nnumber ($\\sim$20) and lie within a sector of the Milky Way where the environmental \nconditions such as molecular gas surface density and ambient UV radiation field may be very \ndifferent than the inner Galaxy \\citep{Gutermuth:2009, Heiderman:2010, Gutermuth:2011, Lada:2012, Heyer:2015}.  \nThe study by \\citet{Wu:2005} evaluated the relationship between the far infrared luminosity \nand dense gas, as probed by HCN J=1-0 line emission for a sample of massive dense cores with infrared luminosities \nbetween 10$^3$ and 10$^7$ L$_\\odot$, many of which contain ultracompact HII regions, and a smaller sub-sample of lower luminosity objects with molecular outflows.\nThey found a linear correlation between $L_{FIR}$ and $L_{HCN}$ \nfor $L_{FIR} > 10^{4.5}$.\nIn our study, we have a more direct measure of {\\mbox{${\\rm H}_2$}}\\ column density gas distributed \nwithin  dense, compact configurations.

From this luminosity, the same Monte-Carlo method is applied \nto estimate a corresponding YSO mass and uncertainties using\nthe probability distributions, $P(M,L_{24}|L_*)$ similarly constructed from the \\citet{Robitaille:2006} Class~I models. \nWe assign the +2$\\sigma$ mass as an upper limit for the YSO mass within each unlinked ATLASGAL clump.  \nThe corresponding 2$\\sigma$ upper limits of $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ for these non-star forming clumps are reported in Table~\\ref{table4}. \n\nThe variation of $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ with {\\mbox{${\\rm H}_2$}}\\ mass surface density, $\\Sigma_{H2}$,  for these ATLASGAL \nsources is shown in Figure~\\ref{sflaws}a. The 2$\\sigma$ upper limits for the starless clumps are plotted as \ncrosses.  For context, \npoints for local star forming regions from \\citet{Gutermuth:2009}, \n\\citet{Lada:2012}, and \\citet{Evans:2014} are plotted.  The star formation relationships \ndetermined by \\citet{Kennicutt:1998} and \\citet{Bigiel:2008} for galaxies are also shown. \nThe detected ATLASGAL star formation rates \nlie well above the extragalactic relationships for the same value \nof $\\Sigma_{H2}$, as found by \\citet{Heiderman:2010} and \\citet{Gutermuth:2011}. \nThis \n displacement is reduced when including the star formation rate upper limits for non star forming clumps and \nsuggests that there is no large descrepancy of star formation rates for comparable gas surface density \nbetween resolved star forming regions and the extragalactic measurements.\n\nNo significant correlation between $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ and $\\Sigma_{H2}$ is present in this set of ATLASGAL clumps. \nFor most of these points, there is a limited \namount of dynamic range in $\\Sigma_{H2}$ and the scatter of $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ is large, which \nprecludes the identification of any relationship.  \nErrors in $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ surely contribute to some of this scatter but variance within the clump \npopulation is also a source.  The \ncloud of ATLASGAL points and the data from the local star forming regions do align along \nthe proposed linear relationship by \\citet{Wu:2005} (solid line in Figure~\\ref{sflaws}a) \nthat describes the star formation \nrates in dense gas.\n\nThe global star formation law posits that the production of stars is regulated by \nlarge scale, radial \nprocesses that affect the gas over an orbital time scale \\citep{Wyse:1989, Kennicutt:1998,\nTan:2000,Tan:2010, Suwannajak:2014}. \nThe variation of $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ with $\\Sigma_{H2}/\\tau_{orb}$ is shown \nin \nFigure~\\ref{sflaws}b.  \nOrbital periods for the solar neighborhood clouds and clumps compiled by \\citet{Gutermuth:2009}, \n\\citet{Lada:2012}, and \\citet{Evans:2014} \nare derived for $R_G$=8.4~kpc \\citep{Reid:2009}. \nThere is no correlation between these quantities \nwithin the set of ATLASGAL points owing in part, to \nthe limited range of $R_G$ values. 95\\% of the star-forming clumps are located between Galactic radii 2~kpc and 8~kpc.\nThe cloud of points is \naligned with those of the solar neighborhood clouds\nalong a linear line with $\\epsilon_{orb}$$\\sim$1.  This efficiency value is much larger \nthan the value of $\\sim$0.1 estimated by \\citet{Kennicutt:1998} for disk galaxies.\nWhile large scale processes may impact the formation of molecular \nclouds from the diffuse, atomic medium \\citep{Koda:2015}, these \ndo not impact the star formation rates within the dense clumps \nof molecular clouds. \n\nThe volumetric \nstar formation law considers a fixed fraction of a molecular cloud or clump, $\\epsilon_{ff}$,\nis converted into \nstars over a free-fall time based on the local volume density.  \nFigure~\\ref{sflaws}c shows the ATLASGAL star forming regions in context \nwith the volumetric law.  An error-weighted fit to the ATLASGAL points shows a linear relationship \nwith normalization $\\epsilon_{ff}=0.003\\pm0.001$, a power-law index\n1.02$\\pm$0.06, a reduced $\\chi^2$=0.89, and a root mean square of 0.4 dex. \nThe fitted value for $\\epsilon_{ff}$ is $\\sim$3-4 times lower than the value of 0.01 \nfound by \\citet{Krumholz:2012} that describes star formation rates from local \nclouds to high redshift galaxies.  We emphasize that these star formation \nrates are lower limits.  Repeating the fit using the total YSO mass assuming \na fully sampled IMF, the parameters are:\n$\\epsilon_{ff}=0.02\\pm0.01$, a power-law index\n1.14$\\pm$0.06, a reduced $\\chi^2$=1.2, and a root mean square of 0.5 dex. \nSince $\\Sigma_{SFR,imf}$ is an upper limit, the true value of $\\epsilon_{ff}$ lies somewhere \nbetween these two (0.003, 0.02) values.  On the other hand, inclusion of the 2$\\sigma$ upper limits  for \nnon-star forming clumps would bias the efficiency towards lower values.  \n\n\\begin{figure*} [htp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\hsize]{sflaws.eps}\n\\caption{Variation of star formation rate normalized by area, $\\Sigma_{SFR}$  \nwith a) $\\Sigma_{H2}$, b) $\\Sigma_{H2}/\\tau_{orb}$, \nc) $\\Sigma_{H2}/\\tau_{ff}$, and d) $\\Sigma_{H2}/\\tau_{cross}$ for resolved ATLASGAL clumps \nwith measured distances.

The production of new stars begins immediately after the structure has condensed \nfrom its overlying substrate and is completed within several crossing time scales. \nThe dependence of the star formation rate on the crossing time scale within this set of ATLASGAL clumps is \nexamined in Figure~\\ref{sflaws}d.  There are 59 star forming and 44 non-star forming \nATLASGAL clumps with velocity \ndispersions from NH$_3$ line emission that also satisfy the 24{$\\mu$m}\\ completeness and \nresolved clump size \nrequirements.  The star formation rate surface density, $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ is \nwell correlated with $\\Sigma_{H2}/\\tau_{cross}$.   An error-weighted power law fit to the \n59 points produces the following parameters:\n$\\epsilon_{cross}=0.03\\pm0.016$, a power-law index\n0.91$\\pm$0.09, a reduced $\\chi^2$=3.2, and a root mean square of 0.3 dex. \nWhile this is a lower limit to the efficiency of star forming clumps per crossing time,\ninclusion of the upper limits of non-star forming clumps would lower the overall efficiency \nwithin dense substructures of molecular clouds.  Based on these data, star formation is well \nlinked to the local crossing time of a clump but does not proceed rapidly or efficiently. \n\nOverall, the derived star formation rates within dense clumps traced by the thermal \ndust continuum emission favors the regulation \nof stellar production by local conditions or processes.  The strongest correlations \nare identified in Figures~\\ref{sflaws}c,d in which $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ depends on the dense, gas \nsurface density normalized by the free-fall and clump crossing times respectively.  The low \nefficiencies of 1\\% or less for $\\epsilon_{ff}$ and $\\epsilon_{cross}$ and \nthe long latency times implied by $f_*$, \npoint towards a localized process or state that slows the rate \nof star formation  or limits the amount of material that is transformed into stars \nwithin these dense gas configurations. \n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nWe have examined the ATLASGAL and MIPSGAL source catalogs to link Class~I young stellar objects to \ntheir natal, massive, dense clump from which these formed.  Only 23\\% of the 3494 clumps, selected \nto have low, 24{$\\mu$m}\\ backgrounds, are found to be associated with early-stage protostars.  Accounting \nfor clumps with saturated 24{$\\mu$m}\\ emission, this fraction increases to 31\\%. Using models of YSO \ncircumstellar environments, we estimate the central masses of YSOs linked to ATLASGAL sources with assigned \ndistances.  The YSO mass range is 1 to 10 {M$_\\odot$}, limited on the low side by background and on the high side \nby saturation of the Mips 24{$\\mu$m}\\ detectors.   Star formation rates are derived for ATLASGAL sources with \ndistances as well as upper limits for starless clumps.  These are compared to star formation regions in the \nsolar neighborhood and extragalactic relationships.  Star formation relationships that consider local gas conditions \nsuch as the free-fall and crossing times provide a reasonable description to this set of resolved star forming regions. \n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nThis work was supported by the NASA\nADAP grant NNX13AF08G (MH,RG), the\nCollaborative Research Center 956, funded by the \\emph{Deut\\-sche For\\-schungs\\-ge\\-mein\\-schaft, DFG\\/}  via the SPP (priority program) (MH)\nand the \\emph{Deut\\-sche For\\-schungs\\-ge\\-mein\\-schaft, DFG\\/}  via the SPP (priority program) \n1573 'Physics of the ISM' (TCs).
