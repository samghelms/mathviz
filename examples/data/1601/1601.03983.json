The random correlations produce, as expected, a constant background. The half-life is determined by a least squares fit to the data with the function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}. A $T_{1/2}$ = 32.9(8) ms is obtained for $^{56}$Zn.  A fit using a maximum likelihood minimization method gives very similar results. Additionally, we checked that the result is not affected by the choice of the fit range by performing the fit for several ranges.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.\\columnwidth]{Halflife56.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between each proton decay (DSSSD energy $>$ 0.8 MeV) and all the $^{56}$Zn implants.}\n\t\\label{T56p}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor comparison, if we use the Bateman equations \\cite{Bateman1910} to fit the $^{56}$Zn correlation-time spectrum containing all the decays (Fig. \\ref{T56all}), we have to include: the $\\beta$ decay of $^{56}$Zn to $^{56}$Cu, which partially goes to the ground state of $^{56}$Cu and partially undergoes proton emission to $^{55}$Ni; the $\\beta$ decay of $^{56}$Cu to $^{56}$Ni; and the $\\beta$ decay of $^{55}$Ni to $^{55}$Co. As expected, we get a similar result $T_{1/2}$ = 31.2(11) ms. We prefer the first method because it is independent of the $\\beta$ detection efficiency.\n\n\\subsubsection{\\label{bg}Background from the random correlations}\n\nVarious methods can be used to deal with the random-correlation background. As in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, we included a constant background in the fit function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}. This is a well-established method to be used in simple cases such as the present one, where the beam is continuous. If instead one subtracts the background before fitting, there is an additional source of uncertainty when fitting the final spectrum because of the fluctuations introduced by the subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, a method that is very useful when the beam is pulsed has been developed in Refs. \\cite{Molina2011,PhysRevC.91.014301}. There, a correlation-time spectrum for the background is constructed by performing the time correlations in the $opposite~pixel$, i.e., between decays in the pixel [$i$,$j$] and implants in the pixel [$j$,$i$] for $i \\neq j$. The background spectrum is then subtracted from the main correlation-time spectrum. By applying this method in our case we get consistent results but a larger uncertainty on $T_{1/2}$ caused by the subtraction. Besides, the background spectrum introduces many fluctuations because of its low statistics. Indeed in our case most of the ions produced were implanted in the same region of the DSSSD as $^{56}$Zn, thus the opposite pixel can have few events when far from the implantation region. This is not the case for the nuclei studied in Refs. \\cite{Molina2011,PhysRevC.91.014301}.\n\nIn order to increase the statistics of the background spectrum we have also considered an $extended$ background spectrum created by correlating the decays in the pixel [$i$,$j$] with the implants in all the pixels of the DSSSD but the 8 pixels surrounding the pixel [$i$,$j$] and the pixel [$i$,$j$] itself. In this way the statistics of the background spectrum are indeed improved, however when the beam is continuous we still prefer the first method because it avoids the introduction of additional fluctuations due to the background subtraction.\n\nIn summary, as expected the three methods give consistent results. The choice of the method depends on the details of the experiment carried out (beam properties and implantation pattern). \n\nFinally, in Ref. \\cite{Molina2011} a peculiar effect has been observed. Ideally the profile of the random-correlation background is expected to be a constant. However, there can be situations where the background profile is not flat, but has a shape. For example, the shape can be affected by pulsing of the beam, or by the limited duration of the runs. In the latter case the background assumes a triangular shape centred at $T_{1/2}$ = 0 \\cite{Molina2011}. This effect is more pronounced as the runs become shorter and it may affect the determination of $T_{1/2}$. The effect and the procedure to correct for it will be described in detail elsewhere.\n\nHere we performed the time correlations over a huge period $\\mathcal{T}$ to study the background profile. In the present case the duration of the runs is large enough that the background profile is not affected. We verified that the results for the half-life fit are the same both with and without applying the correction for this effect.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{eff}DSSSD detection efficiency}\n\nA DSSSD detection efficiency of 100\\% has been assumed for both implants and $\\beta$-delayed protons. A rather low efficiency value is expected for the $\\beta$ particles, also reflected in the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ emission, because of the combined effect of the small energy loss of the betas in the DSSSD detector (about 100-200 keV) and the electronic threshold. In contrast, the $\\beta$-delayed proton emission yields a much higher signal in the DSSSD so that the proton detection efficiency is not affected by the threshold and, if the implantation occurs in the middle of the DSSSD, it is close to 100\\%.\n\nA Monte Carlo simulation of the detection efficiency for protons is shown as a function of their energy in Fig. 5 of Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, where different implantation depths in a 300 $\\mu$m thick DSSSD detector are considered. It was found that the detection efficiency was symmetric with respect to the center of the detector. If the $^{56}$Zn ions are implanted in the center of the DSSSD (150 $\\mu$m), the efficiency for protons of 3.5 MeV is 100\\%. We simulated the implantation profile of the $^{56}$Zn ions in the DSSSD in realistic conditions using the simulation code LISE \\cite{Tarasov20084657}, obtaining a distribution centred in the DSSSD and having a width of 30 $\\mu$m FWHM. The experts from GANIL indicate that the differences in the implantation depth between the LISE simulations and the measurements are of the order of 10 $\\mu$m. We estimated that a reasonable systematic error of 20 $\\mu$m in the implantation depth would lead to a proton efficiency still very close to 100\\%. This systematic error is included in the quoted uncertainty.\n\nThe $\\beta$ detection efficiency of the DSSSD is determined by means of known $\\beta\\gamma$ emitters, i.e., the $T_z$ = -1 nuclei populated in the dataset focused on $^{58}$Zn. As distinct from the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei under study, $\\beta$-delayed proton emission is not present in these $T_z$ = -1 isotopes. Indeed their decay proceeds by either $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ emission or by $\\beta$ decay to the ground state, thus they can be used to estimate the $\\beta$ detection efficiency of the DSSSD from:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17424, "prevtext": " \n\n\n\\title{Beta decay of the exotic $T_z$ = -2 nuclei $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn}\n\n\\author{S.~E.~A.~Orrigo}\\email{sonja.orrigo@ific.uv.es}{\\affiliation{Instituto de F{\\'i}sica Corpuscular, CSIC-Universidad de Valencia, E-46071 Valencia, Spain}}\n\\author{B.~Rubio}{\\affiliation{Instituto de F{\\'i}sica Corpuscular, CSIC-Universidad de Valencia, E-46071 Valencia, Spain}}\n\\author{Y.~Fujita}{\\affiliation{Department of Physics, Osaka University, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-0043, Japan}}{\\affiliation{Research Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University, Ibaraki, Osaka 567-0047, Japan}}\n\\author{W.~Gelletly}{\\affiliation{Instituto de F{\\'i}sica Corpuscular, CSIC-Universidad de Valencia, E-46071 Valencia, Spain}}{\\affiliation{Department of Physics, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, UK}}\n\\author{J.~Agramunt}{\\affiliation{Instituto de F{\\'i}sica Corpuscular, CSIC-Universidad de Valencia, E-46071 Valencia, Spain}}\n\\author{A.~Algora}{\\affiliation{Instituto de F{\\'i}sica Corpuscular, CSIC-Universidad de Valencia, E-46071 Valencia, Spain}}{\\affiliation{Inst. of Nuclear Research of the Hung.

In all the cases we have extracted the half-lives and the total $\\beta$-delayed proton emission branching ratios. We have measured the individual $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays with their branching ratios. Decay schemes have been determined for the three nuclei, and new energy levels are identified in the corresponding daughter nuclei. Competition between $\\beta$-delayed protons and gammas is observed in the de-excitation of the $T$ = 2 Isobaric Analogue States in all three cases. Absolute Fermi and Gamow-Teller transition strengths have been determined. The mass excesses of the nuclei under study have been deduced.

The experimental challenge of exploring this $Terra\\ Incognita$ demands and has driven the construction of a new generation of facilities for the production and accelerations of radioactive ion beams. The steady improvement in the range of beams available and their intensities means that more and more proton-rich nuclei can be produced up to the proton drip-line, enabling one to perform detailed decay studies and explore new and exotic decay modes.\n\nBeta-decay spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate the structure of exotic nuclei. Beta decay is a weak interaction process mediated by the well-understood $\\tau$ and $\\sigma\\tau$ operators, responsible for the observed Fermi (F) and Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions, respectively. It provides direct access to the absolute values of the corresponding transition strengths, $B$(F) and $B$(GT).\n\nThe GT transitions are the most common weak interaction processes of $\\sigma\\tau$ type in atomic nuclei. They are characterized by an angular momentum transfer $\\Delta L$ = 0 and spin-isospin flip ($\\Delta S$ = 1 and $\\Delta T$ = 1), while $\\Delta S$ = 0 and $\\Delta T$ = 0 for F transitions. Due to the simple nature of the operator, the GT transitions are an important tool for the study of nuclear structure \\cite{Bohr1969,RevModPhys.64.491,Rubio2009,Fujita2011549}, providing information on the overlap between the wave-functions of the parent ground state and the states populated in the daughter nucleus. Moreover, they play an important role in nuclear astrophysics, especially in stellar evolution, supernovae explosions and nucleosynthesis \\cite{RevModPhys.75.819}. Since many heavy proton-rich elements are produced in the $rp$-process passing through proton-rich $fp$-shell nuclei, the study of GT transitions starting from unstable proton-rich nuclei is also of crucial importance. Our knowledge of GT transitions when approaching the proton drip-line is still rather incomplete \\cite{RevModPhys.75.819}, however, because the production of such nuclei becomes steadily more challenging.\n\nNormally in proton-rich nuclei proton decay is expected to dominate above the proton separation energy. In this contest proton-rich nuclei with the third component of isospin $T_z$ = -2 are of particular interest because their decay may present peculiarities such as the competition between $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501,Dossat200718}. Moreover recently a rare and exotic decay mode, the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay, has been observed for the first time in the $fp$-shell in the decay of $^{56}$Zn \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. \n\nIn this paper we present the results of a study of the $\\beta$ decay of the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn. The analysis of the data is described in detail using the $^{56}$Zn case as an example, expanding on some of the procedures already presented in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section \\ref{exp} describes the experiment performed at GANIL. Section \\ref{analysis} describes the data analysis procedures. Section \\ref{results} presents the experimental results for the $\\beta$ decays of $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn. The determination of the mass excess of the nuclei under study is addressed in Section \\ref{masses}. Finally, Section \\ref{concl} gives our conclusions.\n\n\\section{\\label{exp}Experimental set-up}\n\nThe experiment to study the decay of $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn was performed at the LISE3 facility of GANIL (France) \\cite{Mueller1991559} in 2010. A $^{58}$Ni$^{26+}$ primary beam, with an average intensity of 3.7 e$\\mu$A, was accelerated to 74.5 MeV/nucleon and fragmented on a natural Ni target, 200 $\\mu$m thick. The LISE3 separator \\cite{Anne1992276} was used to select the fragments, which were implanted into a Double-Sided Silicon Strip Detector (DSSSD), 300 $\\mu$m thick. The DSSSD had 16 X and 16 Y strips with a pitch of 3 mm, defining 256 pixels. Two parallel electronic chains were used having different gains to detect both the implanted heavy-ions and subsequent charged-particle (betas and protons) decays. The DSSSD was surrounded by four EXOGAM Ge clovers \\cite{exogam} used to detect the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays.\n\nThe experiment was focused on the study of some $T_z$ = -2 proton-rich nuclei. The energy of the $^{58}$Ni beam was optimized to implant $^{56}$Zn close to the middle of the DSSSD. Data were also taken by optimizing on $^{48}$Fe to increase the statistics for this ion. Further data were also recorded by focusing on the $T_z$ = -1, $^{58}$Zn nucleus, of astrophysics interest since it constitutes a waiting point in the $rp$-process. The results from this dataset were used for comparison with a previous experiment and to estimate the DSSSD $\\beta$ detection efficiency.\n\nThe Time-of-Flight (ToF) was defined as the time difference between the cyclotron radio-frequency and the signal in a silicon $\\Delta E$ detector located 28 cm upstream. Simultaneous signals in both the $\\Delta E$ detector and the DSSSD defined an implantation event. The implanted ions were identified by combining the energy loss signal in the $\\Delta E$ detector and the ToF signal. An example of the two-dimensional identification matrix obtained for the setting focused on $^{56}$Zn is shown in Fig. \\ref{ID1plot}, where the positions of the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn are indicated. The identification matrix obtained for the dataset optimized for $^{48}$Fe is shown in Fig. \\ref{ID2plot}, where the positions of $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni are indicated.\n\nA signal above threshold (typically 50-90 keV) in the DSSSD and no coincident signal in the $\\Delta E$ detector defined a decay event.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth,trim={0 0 0 5.3cm},clip]{ID1.pdf}\n\t\\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n \t\\caption{$\\Delta E$ versus ToF identification plot for the dataset optimized to implant $^{56}$Zn close to the middle of the DSSSD.

Here we also expand on some of the details already presented in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. The $^{56}$Zn case is used as an example for the discussion. $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni were analyzed following the same procedure; eventual differences are also discussed.\n\nThe $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni or $^{56}$Zn ions were selected by setting gates off-line on the $\\Delta E$-ToF matrix (see Figs. \\ref{ID1plot} and \\ref{ID2plot}). The total numbers of implanted nuclei detected, $N_{imp}$, were: $^{48}$Fe: 5.1x10$^{4}$, $^{52}$Ni: 5.3x10$^{5}$, $^{56}$Zn: 8.9x10$^{3}$.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{correl}Time correlations}\n\nIn decay-spectroscopy experiments performed with a continuous beam, no univocal correlation between a given implantation event and its corresponding decay event can be established \\cite{Dossat200718}. A widely-used approach \\cite{Dossat200718,PhysRevLett.112.222501,PhysRevC.91.014301} is to construct the correlations in time between all implantations and decay events. To this end, the 256 pixels defined in the DSSSD can be used as independent detectors. The $\\it{correlation~time}$ $t_{corr}$ is defined as the time difference between a decay event in a given pixel of the DSSSD and any implantation signal that occurred before or after it in the same pixel that satisfied the conditions required to identify the nuclear species. The correlation condition is $|t_{corr}|=|t_{decay} - t_{implant}|<\\mathcal{T}$, where $\\mathcal{T}$ is a chosen period of time. This means that a given decay event will be correlated with all the implantations happening in the same pixel within the time $\\mathcal{T}$, and viceversa. There will be a true correlation only when that decay event belongs to the implantation event under consideration. Otherwise correlations will be random because the decay event will be artificially correlated with an implantation happening before or after the implantation to which it really belongs.\n\nThis procedure ensures that all the true correlations are taken into account, at the price of including many random correlations. The correlation-time spectrum and the energy spectra resulting from this method will therefore contain both true and random correlations.\n\nIn the correlation-time spectrum the random events will form a constant background which can easily be taken into account, while the true correlations will form the typical exponential decay curve. As an example, the correlation-time spectrum for $^{56}$Zn including all the decays (betas and protons) is shown in Fig. \\ref{T56all}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Tcorr.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between each decay event and all the $^{56}$Zn implants (see text).}\n\t\\label{T56all}\n\\end{figure}\n\nBesides the truly-correlated decays, the energy spectra will contain decay events coming from either the same ion but a different implantation event, or from different nuclei. These randoms have to be carefully removed. The background subtraction procedure is described in Sections \\ref{DSSSD} and \\ref{gamma} for the charged-particle and gamma energy spectra, respectively.\n\nWe decided to correlate decays and implants in a period $\\mathcal{T}$ = 50 s, i.e., in the interval [-50 s, +50 s]. This is different from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718} where the correlations were formed in the interval [0, 5000 ms]. There are two motivations for this choice. The $\\it{correlations~in~the~past}$, [-50 s, 0], clearly have no physical meaning but they are useful in the background subtraction procedure (see Section \\ref{DSSSD}). The choice of a huge period $\\mathcal{T}$ allows one to check and limit another effect, which is described in Section \\ref{bg}.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{T}Determination of the half-life}\n\n\\subsubsection{\\label{Tfit}Half-life fits}\n\nFor each nucleus of interest, the correlation-time spectrum can be constructed as explained in Section \\ref{correl}. This spectrum includes all the decays (betas and protons) correlated with a given implant. Thus all the possible decays, from the parent nucleus or its daughters, have to be taken into account in the fit of the half-life $T_{1/2}$ with the Bateman equations \\cite{Bateman1910}.\n\nThe detection efficiency for a particular decay event will depend strongly on the decay mode of that event, i.e., either by $\\beta$-delayed protons or only by betas. Indeed the detection efficiency of the DSSSD is very different for protons (close to 1) and for $\\beta$ particles (much smaller than 1), see Section \\ref{eff}. Therefore for nuclei where the decay mode is only by betas, the integration of the parent contribution and descendents will depend on the rather limited $\\beta$ detection efficiency $\\epsilon_{\\beta}$ of the DSSSD. \n\n$^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn all emit $\\beta$-delayed protons. Thus in all these cases an additional condition can be imposed to select only the proton decays. This is achieved by setting an energy threshold in the DSSSD spectrum (Section \\ref{DSSSD}) which removes the pure $\\beta$ decays while keeping the $\\beta$-delayed protons, and selecting correlated implants for the desired nuclear species. The advantage is that the daughter activity (where no protons are present) is removed from the correlation-time spectrum. In this way the half-life can be fitted by using the simple exponential function:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  N(t)=N_p~exp(-ln2~t/T_{1/2})+C \\,,\n  \\label{Eq1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N(t)=N_{p}~{}exp(-ln2~{}t/T_{1/2})+C\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>l</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mn>2</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>C</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03983.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $N_{\\beta}$ is the number of $\\beta$ decays obtained by integrating the parent activity from the correlation-time spectrum for these nuclei, and $\\tau$ is the dead time.

We obtain $\\epsilon_{\\beta}$ = 13.6(6) \\%.\n\nAs explained in Section \\ref{exp}, the data acquisition system was triggered by either an implantation event or by a decay event (betas or protons). The $\\gamma$ rays were not included in the trigger. The $\\gamma$ emissions were acquired in coincidence with the decay events, which are affected by the corresponding DSSSD efficiency.

The random correlations produce, as expected, a constant background. The half-life is determined by a least squares fit to the data with the function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}. A $T_{1/2}$ = 32.9(8) ms is obtained for $^{56}$Zn.  A fit using a maximum likelihood minimization method gives very similar results. Additionally, we checked that the result is not affected by the choice of the fit range by performing the fit for several ranges.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.\\columnwidth]{Halflife56.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between each proton decay (DSSSD energy $>$ 0.8 MeV) and all the $^{56}$Zn implants.}\n\t\\label{T56p}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor comparison, if we use the Bateman equations \\cite{Bateman1910} to fit the $^{56}$Zn correlation-time spectrum containing all the decays (Fig. \\ref{T56all}), we have to include: the $\\beta$ decay of $^{56}$Zn to $^{56}$Cu, which partially goes to the ground state of $^{56}$Cu and partially undergoes proton emission to $^{55}$Ni; the $\\beta$ decay of $^{56}$Cu to $^{56}$Ni; and the $\\beta$ decay of $^{55}$Ni to $^{55}$Co. As expected, we get a similar result $T_{1/2}$ = 31.2(11) ms. We prefer the first method because it is independent of the $\\beta$ detection efficiency.\n\n\\subsubsection{\\label{bg}Background from the random correlations}\n\nVarious methods can be used to deal with the random-correlation background. As in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, we included a constant background in the fit function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}. This is a well-established method to be used in simple cases such as the present one, where the beam is continuous. If instead one subtracts the background before fitting, there is an additional source of uncertainty when fitting the final spectrum because of the fluctuations introduced by the subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, a method that is very useful when the beam is pulsed has been developed in Refs. \\cite{Molina2011,PhysRevC.91.014301}. There, a correlation-time spectrum for the background is constructed by performing the time correlations in the $opposite~pixel$, i.e., between decays in the pixel [$i$,$j$] and implants in the pixel [$j$,$i$] for $i \\neq j$. The background spectrum is then subtracted from the main correlation-time spectrum. By applying this method in our case we get consistent results but a larger uncertainty on $T_{1/2}$ caused by the subtraction. Besides, the background spectrum introduces many fluctuations because of its low statistics. Indeed in our case most of the ions produced were implanted in the same region of the DSSSD as $^{56}$Zn, thus the opposite pixel can have few events when far from the implantation region. This is not the case for the nuclei studied in Refs. \\cite{Molina2011,PhysRevC.91.014301}.\n\nIn order to increase the statistics of the background spectrum we have also considered an $extended$ background spectrum created by correlating the decays in the pixel [$i$,$j$] with the implants in all the pixels of the DSSSD but the 8 pixels surrounding the pixel [$i$,$j$] and the pixel [$i$,$j$] itself. In this way the statistics of the background spectrum are indeed improved, however when the beam is continuous we still prefer the first method because it avoids the introduction of additional fluctuations due to the background subtraction.\n\nIn summary, as expected the three methods give consistent results. The choice of the method depends on the details of the experiment carried out (beam properties and implantation pattern). \n\nFinally, in Ref. \\cite{Molina2011} a peculiar effect has been observed. Ideally the profile of the random-correlation background is expected to be a constant. However, there can be situations where the background profile is not flat, but has a shape. For example, the shape can be affected by pulsing of the beam, or by the limited duration of the runs. In the latter case the background assumes a triangular shape centred at $T_{1/2}$ = 0 \\cite{Molina2011}. This effect is more pronounced as the runs become shorter and it may affect the determination of $T_{1/2}$. The effect and the procedure to correct for it will be described in detail elsewhere.\n\nHere we performed the time correlations over a huge period $\\mathcal{T}$ to study the background profile. In the present case the duration of the runs is large enough that the background profile is not affected. We verified that the results for the half-life fit are the same both with and without applying the correction for this effect.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{eff}DSSSD detection efficiency}\n\nA DSSSD detection efficiency of 100\\% has been assumed for both implants and $\\beta$-delayed protons. A rather low efficiency value is expected for the $\\beta$ particles, also reflected in the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ emission, because of the combined effect of the small energy loss of the betas in the DSSSD detector (about 100-200 keV) and the electronic threshold. In contrast, the $\\beta$-delayed proton emission yields a much higher signal in the DSSSD so that the proton detection efficiency is not affected by the threshold and, if the implantation occurs in the middle of the DSSSD, it is close to 100\\%.\n\nA Monte Carlo simulation of the detection efficiency for protons is shown as a function of their energy in Fig. 5 of Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, where different implantation depths in a 300 $\\mu$m thick DSSSD detector are considered. It was found that the detection efficiency was symmetric with respect to the center of the detector. If the $^{56}$Zn ions are implanted in the center of the DSSSD (150 $\\mu$m), the efficiency for protons of 3.5 MeV is 100\\%. We simulated the implantation profile of the $^{56}$Zn ions in the DSSSD in realistic conditions using the simulation code LISE \\cite{Tarasov20084657}, obtaining a distribution centred in the DSSSD and having a width of 30 $\\mu$m FWHM. The experts from GANIL indicate that the differences in the implantation depth between the LISE simulations and the measurements are of the order of 10 $\\mu$m. We estimated that a reasonable systematic error of 20 $\\mu$m in the implantation depth would lead to a proton efficiency still very close to 100\\%. This systematic error is included in the quoted uncertainty.\n\nThe $\\beta$ detection efficiency of the DSSSD is determined by means of known $\\beta\\gamma$ emitters, i.e., the $T_z$ = -1 nuclei populated in the dataset focused on $^{58}$Zn. As distinct from the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei under study, $\\beta$-delayed proton emission is not present in these $T_z$ = -1 isotopes. Indeed their decay proceeds by either $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ emission or by $\\beta$ decay to the ground state, thus they can be used to estimate the $\\beta$ detection efficiency of the DSSSD from:\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\epsilon_{\\beta} = \\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_{imp}~(1-\\tau)} \\,,\n  \\label{Eq2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\epsilon_{\\beta}=\\frac{N_{\\beta}}{N_{imp}~{}(1-\\tau)}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03f5</mi><mi>\u03b2</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>\u03b2</mi></msub><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03c4</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03983.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $N_{\\gamma}$ represents the number of counts in the given $\\gamma$ line and $\\epsilon_{\\gamma}$ is the $\\gamma$ detection efficiency of the EXOGAM Ge clovers (see Section \\ref{gamma}).

The selection of the proton emission is achieved by setting an energy threshold in the DSSSD spectrum. As discussed in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, the systematics of this procedure can be estimated by repeating the determination of $B_p$ using a DSSSD threshold differing by $\\pm$100 keV.\n\nSince the dead time $\\tau$ could change in the different measurements, we calculated a weighted-averaged dead time in the same way as in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}. The dead time recorded in each run was weighted by the number of implants of a given ion in that run and divided by the total $N_{imp}$ of that isotope.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{DSSSD}Analysis of the charged-particle spectrum}\n\nA 300 $\\mu$m thick DSSSD detector was used to detect both the implanted heavy-ions and the following charged-particle (betas and protons) decays (see Section \\ref{exp}). The strips of the DSSSD were calibrated and aligned using an $\\alpha$-particle source and the peaks of known energy from the decay of $^{53}$Ni \\cite{Dossat200718}. The DSSSD spectrum summed the spectra obtained in all of the 256 pixels.\n\nThe charged-particle spectrum measured in the DSSSD for decays associated with implants of a given nuclear species was formed as follows (the figures shown as examples are related to $^{56}$Zn). A DSSSD spectrum was created by selecting time correlations from 0 to 1 s (red-dashed zone in Fig. \\ref{T56forBG}). This DSSSD spectrum, shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}a, contains both true and random correlations. A background DSSSD spectrum, containing only randoms and shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}b, was formed by setting a gate from -40 to -10 s on the time correlation spectrum (selecting the blue-dotted zone in Fig. \\ref{T56forBG}). The two spectra were then normalized to the time interval used and the spectrum derived from Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}b was subtracted from the spectrum in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}a. The resulting DSSSD spectrum is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}c.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Tcorr2.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between each decay event and all the $^{56}$Zn implants.

The removal of the randoms is achieved in spectrum (c), obtained by subtracting the spectrum (b) from (a).}\n\t\\label{dsssdbg}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nOur procedure is similar to that of Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, but there the gate for the background spectrum was chosen from 1 to 2 s. We chose a larger time gate, 30 s, to increase the statistics of the background spectrum. The advantage is a reduction in the fluctuations coming from the subtraction of the two spectra. This is important in cases such as $^{56}$Zn where the number of counts is limited. Moreover, we use the $\\it{correlations~in~the~past}$ to define a time interval on the left of the peak, which ensures that only randoms are included in the background spectrum.\n\nIn general, a DSSSD spectrum shows a bump at low energy, due to the detection of $\\beta$ particles. The discrete peaks visible above this bump are interpreted as being due to $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. The proportion of $\\beta$-delayed protons to $\\beta$ decay depends on the nucleus under study and it is reflected in the value of $B_p$ (Eq. \\ref{Eq5}). For example, for $^{56}$Zn the strength in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}c is dominated by $\\beta$-delayed proton emission and $B_p$ = 88.5(26) \\%.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{MonteCarlo.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_56Zn.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\caption{(a) Monte Carlo simulations of the level at $E_p$ = 1.1 MeV.

The achievable resolution in the experiment is limited by the summing with the coincident $\\beta$ particles, which also affects the lineshape of the peak. To study the lineshape we performed Monte Carlo simulations for a Silicon DSSSD strip using the 4.9.6 Geant4 code \\cite{geant2003,geant2006}. The radioactive sources (i.e., the implants) were located in an extended area in the middle of the detector, with an implantation profile obtained from LISE calculations \\cite{Tarasov20084657}. Protons of a given energy $E_p$ were emitted at the same time as $\\beta$ particles following a distribution determined by the Fermi function ($\\beta$-decay event generator), with end-point energy corresponding to $Q_{\\beta}-E_p-S_p$, where $S_p$ is the proton separation energy in the daughter nucleus. At the event generation level a widening of 70 keV FWHM was imposed to simulate the DSSSD experimental resolution.\n\nAs an example, Fig. \\ref{MC}a shows the result of the simulations for $\\beta$ decay to a single level with $E_p$ = 1.1 MeV and $E_X$ = 1.7 MeV in $^{56}$Cu. A Gaussian with an exponential high-energy tail describes the lineshape to a good approximation. This result is an additional justification for the procedure widely used in Ref \\cite{Dossat200718}. The lineshape obtained from the simulations was also checked by us with the well isolated $^{57}$Zn proton peak at $E_p$ = 4.6 MeV. We used this lineshape to fit the experimental DSSSD spectra, by keeping the shape fixed (i.e., the Gaussian+exponential and the slope of the exponential) and fitting the parameters of the Gaussian (height, mean, sigma) to the experimental proton peaks. The result for $^{56}$Zn is shown in Fig. \\ref{MC}b. The subroutine \\cite{Jerome}, which allows the use of the same function in a more automated way, was used to cross-check the fit of $^{56}$Zn and to perform the fits for $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni, where many small peaks overlap.\n\nThe procedures adopted allow for a proper determination of the proton centre-of-mass energy $E_p$ and the number of counts $N_p$ in each proton peak $i$.

This is done by taking all the $\\gamma$ decays in coincidence with the $\\beta$ decays. Then the $\\beta$-$\\gamma$ events are correlated with the implantation signals, in the same way as was done in Section \\ref{correl}. The background subtraction procedure is analogous to that adopted to create the DSSSD spectrum (Section \\ref{DSSSD}). An example of the procedure is shown in Fig.  \\ref{gammabg} for the $^{56}$Zn case. A $\\gamma$ spectrum was created by selecting ($\\beta$-$\\gamma$)-implant time correlations from 0 to 1 s, which contains both true and random correlations (Fig. \\ref{gammabg}a). A background $\\gamma$ spectrum, containing only randoms, was formed by setting a gate on the $\\it{correlations~in~the~past}$ (Fig. \\ref{gammabg}b). The two spectra were then normalized to the time interval used and the spectrum in Fig. \\ref{gammabg}b was subtracted from that in Fig. \\ref{gammabg}a to produce Fig. \\ref{gammabg}c.\n\nOnce obtained, the $\\gamma$ spectrum coincident with the decays correlated with a given ion is analyzed. The $\\gamma$ lines of this spectrum are good candidates for $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ transitions belonging to the ion of interest. The half-life associated with each $\\gamma$ line is determined from the fit of a correlation-time spectrum gated on that line, after subtraction of a background correlation-time spectrum obtained by setting an energy gate on the two sides of the $\\gamma$ line (mainly Compton background). This half-life is then compared to the half-life of the ion as a cross-check.\n\nGamma-proton coincidences are also obtained either by placing conditions on the proton peaks of the DSSSD spectrum or by putting gates on the $\\gamma$ lines. In cases such as $^{56}$Zn, where the $\\gamma$ decay is followed by a proton emission, the $\\gamma$-proton coincidences allow for the identification of weak $\\gamma$ lines and further confirm that these transitions belong to the decay of $^{56}$Zn.\n\nEach $\\gamma$ line was fitted by a Gaussian with a linear background to determine the energy centroid $E_{\\gamma}$ and the number of counts $N_{\\gamma}$. The intensity of the line, $I_{\\gamma}$, was then obtained according to either Eq. \\ref{Eq3} or \\ref{Eq4} depending on the case.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{strength}Determination of $B$(F) and $B$(GT)}\n\nFor the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei two kinds of state are expected to be populated in $\\beta$ decay: the $T$ = 2, $J^{\\pi}$ = 0$^{+}$ Isobaric Analogue State (IAS), fed by the Fermi transition, and a number of $T$ = 1, 1$^{+}$ states due to Gamow-Teller transitions. In the present section we describe the procedure used for the determination of the Fermi and GT transition strengths, $B$(F) and $B$(GT), respectively. The peculiarities observed in the decay of each nucleus will be addressed in the Section \\ref{results}.\n\nFor each nucleus, for the proton and $\\gamma$ peaks identified in the DSSSD and $\\gamma$ spectra respectively, we determined the following quantities: the energies of the peaks, from the centroids obtained in the fits; the intensities of the transitions, from the areas of the peaks. The $\\beta$ feeding $I_\\beta$ to the states populated in the daughter nucleus is then deduced.\n\nIn proton-rich nuclei the proton decay is expected to dominate for states well above ($>$1 MeV) the proton separation energy $S_p$ and so usually the $\\beta$ feeding is readily inferred from the intensities of the proton peaks. However, for $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn the de-excitation of the $T$ = 2, IAS via proton decay is isospin-forbidden and it can only happen because of a $T$ = 1 isospin impurity in the IAS. In such cases competition between $\\beta$-delayed proton emission and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ de-excitation from the IAS becomes possible, even at energies well above $S_p$.\n\nWe indeed observe such a competition in the decay of $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn. Thus the intensities of the proton and $\\gamma$ transitions from the IAS have to be added to get the correct $\\beta$ feeding to the IAS, and hence the right amount of Fermi strength. Furthermore, in the case of $^{56}$Zn we observed the exotic $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay in three branches \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. Therefore for a proper determination of $B$(GT) of a given level the intensity deduced from the proton transition has to be corrected for the amount of indirect feeding coming from the $\\gamma$ de-excitation.\n\nThe measured $T_{1/2}$ and $I_\\beta$ were used to determine the $B$(F) and $B$(GT) values according to the equations:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 34058, "prevtext": "\n\n$N_p$ is obtained, together with the half-life, from a fit of the correlation-time spectrum after selection of the proton decays (see Section \\ref{Tfit}). The selection of the proton emission is achieved by setting an energy threshold in the DSSSD spectrum. As discussed in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, the systematics of this procedure can be estimated by repeating the determination of $B_p$ using a DSSSD threshold differing by $\\pm$100 keV.\n\nSince the dead time $\\tau$ could change in the different measurements, we calculated a weighted-averaged dead time in the same way as in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}. The dead time recorded in each run was weighted by the number of implants of a given ion in that run and divided by the total $N_{imp}$ of that isotope.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{DSSSD}Analysis of the charged-particle spectrum}\n\nA 300 $\\mu$m thick DSSSD detector was used to detect both the implanted heavy-ions and the following charged-particle (betas and protons) decays (see Section \\ref{exp}). The strips of the DSSSD were calibrated and aligned using an $\\alpha$-particle source and the peaks of known energy from the decay of $^{53}$Ni \\cite{Dossat200718}. The DSSSD spectrum summed the spectra obtained in all of the 256 pixels.\n\nThe charged-particle spectrum measured in the DSSSD for decays associated with implants of a given nuclear species was formed as follows (the figures shown as examples are related to $^{56}$Zn). A DSSSD spectrum was created by selecting time correlations from 0 to 1 s (red-dashed zone in Fig. \\ref{T56forBG}). This DSSSD spectrum, shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}a, contains both true and random correlations. A background DSSSD spectrum, containing only randoms and shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}b, was formed by setting a gate from -40 to -10 s on the time correlation spectrum (selecting the blue-dotted zone in Fig. \\ref{T56forBG}). The two spectra were then normalized to the time interval used and the spectrum derived from Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}b was subtracted from the spectrum in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}a. The resulting DSSSD spectrum is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}c.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Tcorr2.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between each decay event and all the $^{56}$Zn implants.

Peaks from the $^{53}$Ni contaminant are observed between 1.5 and 2.5 MeV. The removal of the randoms is achieved in spectrum (c), obtained by subtracting the spectrum (b) from (a).}\n\t\\label{dsssdbg}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nOur procedure is similar to that of Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, but there the gate for the background spectrum was chosen from 1 to 2 s. We chose a larger time gate, 30 s, to increase the statistics of the background spectrum. The advantage is a reduction in the fluctuations coming from the subtraction of the two spectra. This is important in cases such as $^{56}$Zn where the number of counts is limited. Moreover, we use the $\\it{correlations~in~the~past}$ to define a time interval on the left of the peak, which ensures that only randoms are included in the background spectrum.\n\nIn general, a DSSSD spectrum shows a bump at low energy, due to the detection of $\\beta$ particles. The discrete peaks visible above this bump are interpreted as being due to $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. The proportion of $\\beta$-delayed protons to $\\beta$ decay depends on the nucleus under study and it is reflected in the value of $B_p$ (Eq. \\ref{Eq5}). For example, for $^{56}$Zn the strength in Fig. \\ref{dsssdbg}c is dominated by $\\beta$-delayed proton emission and $B_p$ = 88.5(26) \\%.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{MonteCarlo.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_56Zn.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\caption{(a) Monte Carlo simulations of the level at $E_p$ = 1.1 MeV.

The achievable resolution in the experiment is limited by the summing with the coincident $\\beta$ particles, which also affects the lineshape of the peak. To study the lineshape we performed Monte Carlo simulations for a Silicon DSSSD strip using the 4.9.6 Geant4 code \\cite{geant2003,geant2006}. The radioactive sources (i.e., the implants) were located in an extended area in the middle of the detector, with an implantation profile obtained from LISE calculations \\cite{Tarasov20084657}. Protons of a given energy $E_p$ were emitted at the same time as $\\beta$ particles following a distribution determined by the Fermi function ($\\beta$-decay event generator), with end-point energy corresponding to $Q_{\\beta}-E_p-S_p$, where $S_p$ is the proton separation energy in the daughter nucleus. At the event generation level a widening of 70 keV FWHM was imposed to simulate the DSSSD experimental resolution.\n\nAs an example, Fig. \\ref{MC}a shows the result of the simulations for $\\beta$ decay to a single level with $E_p$ = 1.1 MeV and $E_X$ = 1.7 MeV in $^{56}$Cu. A Gaussian with an exponential high-energy tail describes the lineshape to a good approximation. This result is an additional justification for the procedure widely used in Ref \\cite{Dossat200718}. The lineshape obtained from the simulations was also checked by us with the well isolated $^{57}$Zn proton peak at $E_p$ = 4.6 MeV. We used this lineshape to fit the experimental DSSSD spectra, by keeping the shape fixed (i.e., the Gaussian+exponential and the slope of the exponential) and fitting the parameters of the Gaussian (height, mean, sigma) to the experimental proton peaks. The result for $^{56}$Zn is shown in Fig. \\ref{MC}b. The subroutine \\cite{Jerome}, which allows the use of the same function in a more automated way, was used to cross-check the fit of $^{56}$Zn and to perform the fits for $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni, where many small peaks overlap.\n\nThe procedures adopted allow for a proper determination of the proton centre-of-mass energy $E_p$ and the number of counts $N_p$ in each proton peak $i$.

Each clover comprised four Ge crystals, giving a total of 16 Ge crystals. Two parallel electronic chains with different amplifiers were used to detect $\\gamma$ rays up to 2 MeV and $\\gamma$ rays of higher energy. The first electronic chain was used in the analysis of all the $\\gamma$ rays up to 2 MeV. In the spectra obtained by using the second electronic chain a problem was detected during the data analysis. As seen from known peaks, a regular deformation pattern was observed, i.e., a distortion of each peak in a interval of $\\approx$60 keV. This affected the analysis of the higher-energy $\\gamma$ rays, particularly for $^{48}$Fe because of the low statistics.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gamma_efficiency.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Calibration of the efficiency for $\\gamma$ detection.

The alignment between the spectra measured in the various crystals was cross-checked and a summed spectrum was constructed. The energy resolution was 4 keV FWHM for the $^{60}$Co line at 1.33 MeV. The $\\gamma$ detection efficiency was calibrated by using the $\\gamma$ lines from the $^{60}$Co, $^{137}$Cs, $^{133}$Ba and $^{207}$Bi sources. An efficiency curve, shown in Fig. \\ref{effg}, was fitted to the experimental data according to the efficiency energy dependence given in Ref. \\cite{Hu1998121}. The $\\gamma$ efficiency was $\\approx$10\\% at 1 MeV $\\gamma$-ray energy.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{h9.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{h10.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{h11.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\caption{$\\gamma$-ray spectra for decay events correlated with $^{56}$Zn implants.

This is done by taking all the $\\gamma$ decays in coincidence with the $\\beta$ decays. Then the $\\beta$-$\\gamma$ events are correlated with the implantation signals, in the same way as was done in Section \\ref{correl}. The background subtraction procedure is analogous to that adopted to create the DSSSD spectrum (Section \\ref{DSSSD}). An example of the procedure is shown in Fig.  \\ref{gammabg} for the $^{56}$Zn case. A $\\gamma$ spectrum was created by selecting ($\\beta$-$\\gamma$)-implant time correlations from 0 to 1 s, which contains both true and random correlations (Fig. \\ref{gammabg}a). A background $\\gamma$ spectrum, containing only randoms, was formed by setting a gate on the $\\it{correlations~in~the~past}$ (Fig. \\ref{gammabg}b). The two spectra were then normalized to the time interval used and the spectrum in Fig. \\ref{gammabg}b was subtracted from that in Fig. \\ref{gammabg}a to produce Fig. \\ref{gammabg}c.\n\nOnce obtained, the $\\gamma$ spectrum coincident with the decays correlated with a given ion is analyzed. The $\\gamma$ lines of this spectrum are good candidates for $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ transitions belonging to the ion of interest. The half-life associated with each $\\gamma$ line is determined from the fit of a correlation-time spectrum gated on that line, after subtraction of a background correlation-time spectrum obtained by setting an energy gate on the two sides of the $\\gamma$ line (mainly Compton background). This half-life is then compared to the half-life of the ion as a cross-check.\n\nGamma-proton coincidences are also obtained either by placing conditions on the proton peaks of the DSSSD spectrum or by putting gates on the $\\gamma$ lines. In cases such as $^{56}$Zn, where the $\\gamma$ decay is followed by a proton emission, the $\\gamma$-proton coincidences allow for the identification of weak $\\gamma$ lines and further confirm that these transitions belong to the decay of $^{56}$Zn.\n\nEach $\\gamma$ line was fitted by a Gaussian with a linear background to determine the energy centroid $E_{\\gamma}$ and the number of counts $N_{\\gamma}$. The intensity of the line, $I_{\\gamma}$, was then obtained according to either Eq. \\ref{Eq3} or \\ref{Eq4} depending on the case.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{strength}Determination of $B$(F) and $B$(GT)}\n\nFor the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei two kinds of state are expected to be populated in $\\beta$ decay: the $T$ = 2, $J^{\\pi}$ = 0$^{+}$ Isobaric Analogue State (IAS), fed by the Fermi transition, and a number of $T$ = 1, 1$^{+}$ states due to Gamow-Teller transitions. In the present section we describe the procedure used for the determination of the Fermi and GT transition strengths, $B$(F) and $B$(GT), respectively. The peculiarities observed in the decay of each nucleus will be addressed in the Section \\ref{results}.\n\nFor each nucleus, for the proton and $\\gamma$ peaks identified in the DSSSD and $\\gamma$ spectra respectively, we determined the following quantities: the energies of the peaks, from the centroids obtained in the fits; the intensities of the transitions, from the areas of the peaks. The $\\beta$ feeding $I_\\beta$ to the states populated in the daughter nucleus is then deduced.\n\nIn proton-rich nuclei the proton decay is expected to dominate for states well above ($>$1 MeV) the proton separation energy $S_p$ and so usually the $\\beta$ feeding is readily inferred from the intensities of the proton peaks. However, for $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn the de-excitation of the $T$ = 2, IAS via proton decay is isospin-forbidden and it can only happen because of a $T$ = 1 isospin impurity in the IAS. In such cases competition between $\\beta$-delayed proton emission and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ de-excitation from the IAS becomes possible, even at energies well above $S_p$.\n\nWe indeed observe such a competition in the decay of $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn. Thus the intensities of the proton and $\\gamma$ transitions from the IAS have to be added to get the correct $\\beta$ feeding to the IAS, and hence the right amount of Fermi strength. Furthermore, in the case of $^{56}$Zn we observed the exotic $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay in three branches \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. Therefore for a proper determination of $B$(GT) of a given level the intensity deduced from the proton transition has to be corrected for the amount of indirect feeding coming from the $\\gamma$ de-excitation.\n\nThe measured $T_{1/2}$ and $I_\\beta$ were used to determine the $B$(F) and $B$(GT) values according to the equations:\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  B(\\mathrm{F}) = K~\\frac{I_{\\beta}^{IAS}(E_{IAS})}{f_{IAS}~T_{1/2}} \\,,\n  \\label{Eq7}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"B(\\mathrm{F})=K~{}\\frac{I_{\\beta}^{IAS}(E_{IAS})}{f_{IAS}~{}T_{1/2}}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>B</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">F</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>K</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>I</mi><mi>\u03b2</mi><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03983.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the index $j$ indicates the daughter state at energy $E_j$, $f_j=f(Q_{\\beta} - E_j,Z)$ is the Fermi factor, $K$ = 6143.6(17) and $\\lambda$ = -1.270(3) are constants \\cite{Fujita2011549}.\n\n\\section{\\label{results}Experimental results}\n\nIn this section we show the experimental results for the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn.

The improved resolution, together with the increased statistics, allowed us to establish for the first time the decay scheme of $^{56}$Zn and to observe the exotic $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}.\n\nNew and detailed spectroscopic information has also been obtained on the $\\beta$ decays of $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni thanks to the improved experimental conditions. The decay schemes of $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni have been enriched with many new states identified in the corresponding daughter nuclei, and the $\\beta$-decay strengths have been extracted.\n\nThe details for each of the three nuclei under study are discussed in the following sections.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{48Fe}Beta decay of $^{48}$Fe}\n\nThe $^{48}$Fe nucleus was detected for the first time at GANIL \\cite{Pougheon1987}. Results from decay studies were presented in Refs. \\cite{Faux1996167,Dossat200718}.\n\nFig. \\ref{T48p} shows the correlation-time spectrum for $^{48}$Fe obtained in our experiment, where the proton decays with energy above 0.94 MeV have been selected in the DSSSD and the region corresponding to the $^{49}$Fe impurity (see below) has also been removed. The half-life is determined by a least squares fit to the data with the function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}, including the $\\beta$ decay of $^{48}$Fe and a constant background. A half-life $T_{1/2}$ = 52(2) ms is obtained.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.\\columnwidth]{Halflife48.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between all the $^{48}$Fe implants and each proton decay (DSSSD energy $E_p>$ 0.94 MeV, with the additional condition $E_p\\notin$[1.85,2.23] MeV to remove the $^{49}$Fe contaminant).}\n\t\\label{T48p}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe charged-particle spectrum measured in the DSSSD for decay events correlated with $^{48}$Fe implants is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssd48}a. The large bump observed at low energy is due to the detection of $\\beta$ particles not coincident with protons. Nine discrete peaks are identified above this bump and interpreted as being due to $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. They are fitted as explained in Section \\ref{DSSSD}. The fit is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssd48}b where the peaks are labelled according to the corresponding excitation energies in $^{48}$Mn, obtained as $E_X=E_p + S_p$ with $S_p$ = 2018(10) keV (see Section \\ref{masses}).

As explained in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, the background subtraction procedure cannot remove completely the activity of very strongly produced isotopes such as $^{49}$Fe. By imposing an increasingly restricted identification cut on $^{48}$Fe we can progressively get rid of the $^{49}$Fe contaminant, but at the price of poorer statistics. We have chosen the reasonable compromise of obtaining a good separation between the residual $^{49}$Fe peak and the $^{48}$Fe peaks. We have also checked that there is no visible contribution from $^{48}$Fe below the $^{49}$Fe peak. Therefore in the construction of the correlation-time spectrum, besides imposing a DSSSD threshold of 0.94 MeV, we have also removed the energy region corresponding to the $^{49}$Fe peak by imposing $E_p\\notin$[1.85,2.23] MeV. In this way we get a $B_p$ = 13.9(7)\\% which is slightly smaller than the value of 15.9(6)\\%, obtained in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718} without removing the residual $^{49}$Fe impurity. If we include the $^{49}$Fe peak we get 15.1(7)\\%, in agreement with Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\nThe $\\gamma$-ray spectrum measured in coincidence with all the decays correlated with the $^{48}$Fe implants is shown in Fig. \\ref{gamma48}. Three $\\gamma$ lines are observed at 90, 98 and 313 keV. The fourth line visible in Fig. \\ref{gamma48} at 261 keV comes from the residual $^{49}$Fe contaminant. A further $\\gamma$ ray of 2633 keV is expected in the decay of $^{48}$Fe \\cite{Dossat200718}, which we can only partially observe because of the problem affecting the low-amplification electronic chain (see Section \\ref{gamma}). Thus in this particular case we took $I_{\\gamma}$ = 30(5)\\% from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718} to calculate the $\\beta$-decay strength.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gamma_48Fe.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{$\\gamma$-ray spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{48}$Fe implants.}\n\t\\label{gamma48}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gp98_48Fe.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{DSSSD charged-particle spectrum correlated with $^{48}$Fe implants.

As expected, the $\\gamma$ lines at 90 and 313 keV are found to be coincident with the $\\beta$ bump. The 98 keV line comes from the decay of the first excited state to the ground state in the proton-daughter $^{47}$Cr \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\nThe DSSSD spectrum gated on the $\\gamma$ line at 98 keV, corrected by the corresponding $\\gamma$ efficiency, is shown in Fig. \\ref{gp98} (dashed-red histogram) and compared with the full DSSD spectrum (black-empty histogram). The 98 keV $\\gamma$ ray is found in coincidence with part of the 3.619 MeV proton peak, indicating that this part of the strength comes from the decay of the 3.713 MeV level to the first excited state of $^{47}$Cr. In addition, the energy difference between the two levels is consistent with the energy of the $\\gamma$ line. The intensities of the 3.619 and 3.713 MeV peaks have been corrected accordingly. In a similar way, the intensities of the triplet of peaks at around 4.4 MeV have also been corrected. Finally, the small peak at $E_p\\approx$ 0.91 MeV is attributed to the decay of the IAS to the first excited state in $^{47}$Cr, and the IAS intensity has been corrected accordingly.\n\nThe coincidence with the 98 keV $\\gamma$ ray selects proton-decay events only. The half-life associated with the $\\gamma$ line at 98 keV is 52(3) ms, which agrees well with the $^{48}$Fe half-life of 52(2) ms obtained in Fig. \\ref{T48p}. This is an additional confirmation that the fit in Fig. \\ref{T48p} is not affected by some possible residual contribution from the $\\beta$ tail in the region $E_p>$ 0.94 MeV.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{48Fe_decay_scheme.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Decay scheme of $^{48}$Fe deduced from the present experiment.}\n\t\\label{decay48}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\t\\caption{Summary of the results for the $\\beta^{+}$ decay of $^{48}$Fe.

Indeed barrier-penetration calculations give a partial proton half-life of $t_{1/2}\\sim10^{-17}$ s, an order-of-magnitude where the $\\gamma$ de-excitation can compete with the proton emission, which is also isospin-forbidden. From our data, each 100 decays from the IAS divide into 13(2) proton decays to the ground state of $^{47}$Cr, and 87(19) $\\gamma$ decays to the ground state of $^{48}$Mn. The two possible decay modes of the IAS give two independent determinations of the excitation energy of the IAS. From our measured proton energy and the experimental mass excess of the ground states in $^{47}$Cr and $^{48}$Mn \\cite{Audi2012} we get $E_X^{IAS}$ = 3.066(170) MeV, while from the summing of the energies of the de-exciting $\\gamma$ lines we obtain $E_X^{IAS}$ = 3.036(2) MeV. The two values agree well with each other and the second is more precise.\n\nThe total $\\beta$ feeding of the IAS is 34.7(50)\\% and $B$(F) = 2.8(4). In order to get the expected $B$(F) = $|N-Z|$ = 4 we calculated that the $\\beta$ feeding should be 50(13)\\%. A possible explanation for the missing IAS feeding could be that there are other weak $\\gamma$ branches which are not observed. In addition, we took the intensity of the 2633 keV $\\gamma$ line from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, where there is also missing IAS feeding and the authors considered the possibility of an overestimation of the $\\gamma$ efficiency at that energy. \n \nConsidering $B_p$ and the intensity of the 90 keV $\\gamma$ line, we get a total $\\beta$ feeding of 84(13)\\%, thus globally there is a missing $\\beta$ feeding of 16(13)\\%. This value is compatible with the missing feeding in the IAS, however the sizable uncertainty lets us explore an additional hypothesis. In the mirror nucleus $^{48}$V two 1$^{+}$ states are observed at 2.288 and 2.406 MeV, also seen in a recent measurement of the charge exchange (CE) reaction $^{48}$Ti($^{3}$He,$t$)$^{48}$V \\cite{Ela2015}. Due to the mirror symmetry, these states should also exist in $^{48}$Mn and they could explain part of the missing feeding. However we cannot make a conclusive statement about this hypothesis because we do not see any $\\gamma$ line compatible with their population or de-excitation, although the statistics expected for these weak lines may place them below our sensitivity limit. In addition the corresponding proton decay from these 1$^{+}$ states is expected at $E_p$ around 300-400 keV and so the corresponding peaks, if they exist, would lie beneath the $\\beta$ bump, making it impossible to identify them in the DSSSD spectrum. In Fig. \\ref{gp98}, however, the coincidence with the 98 keV $\\gamma$ ray suppresses the $\\beta$ bump and a group of peaks is visible in the region 200-500 keV, which are compatible with the expected energies. We calculated the barrier-penetration half-life for the expected protons and found it to be in the range 10$^{-10}$-10$^{-7}$ s, while the partial half-life for $\\gamma$ decay using Weisskopf estimation is around 10$^{-15}$-10$^{-14}$ s. Therefore the gamma decay should dominate unless additional reasons, lying in the structure of the nuclear states involved, would favour the proton decay. \n\n\\subsection{\\label{52Ni}Beta decay of $^{52}$Ni}\n\n$^{52}$Ni was observed for the first time in an experiment carried out at GANIL \\cite{Pougheon1987}. The decay of $^{52}$Ni was studied in Refs. \\cite{PhysRevC.49.2440,Dossat200718}.\n\nFig. \\ref{T52p} shows the correlation-time spectrum obtained for $^{52}$Ni in our experiment, where the proton decays have been selected by putting a threshold of 0.98 MeV on the energy in the DSSSD. The data are fitted with the function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}, including the $\\beta$ decay of $^{52}$Ni and a constant background. A half-life of 42.8(3) ms is obtained. The total proton branching ratio is determined as explained in Section \\ref{Bp}. We obtain $B_p$ = 31.1(5)\\%, in good agreement with the value 31.4(15)\\% from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.\\columnwidth]{Halflife52.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between each proton decay (DSSSD energy $>$ 0.98 MeV) and all the $^{52}$Ni implants.}\n\t\\label{T52p}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig. \\ref{dsssd52}a shows the DSSSD charged-particle spectrum obtained for decay events correlated with $^{52}$Ni implants. The bump observed below 1 MeV is attributed to $\\beta$ particles not coincident with protons. Ten discrete peaks are identified above this bump and interpreted as being due to $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. The fit to these peaks, performed as explained in Section \\ref{DSSSD}, is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssd52}b. The peaks are labelled according to the corresponding excitation energies in $^{52}$Co, obtained by adding $S_p$ = 1573(10) keV (see Section \\ref{masses}) to the measured proton energy $E_p$ in each case.\n\nThe DSSSD spectrum can be compared to the spectrum obtained from the mirror CE experiment, the reaction $^{52}$Cr($^{3}$He,$t$)$^{52}$Mn (see Fig. 45a in Ref. \\cite{Fujita2011549}). All the dominant transitions are observed in both spectra, showing a good isospin symmetry. In detail, the $^{52}$Mn peaks seen in the CE spectrum at $E_X$ = 2.636, 3.585, 4.390 and 5.090 MeV correspond to the $^{52}$Co peaks seen in the DSSSD spectrum at $E_X$ = 2.621, 3.523, 4.375 and 5.024 MeV. In addition we see other small peaks at $E_X$ = 3.148, 3.254, 3.410, 3.634 and 4.461 MeV which seem to be only very weakly populated in the mirror CE process.\n\nMoreover, we observe a strong peak at $E_X$ = 2.925 MeV which is identified as the proton decay of the $^{52}$Co IAS, as in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}. The higher energy resolution of the CE reaction allows the separation of two $^{52}$Mn states lying close in energy, at 2.875(1$^+$) and 2.938(0$^+$) MeV \\cite{Fujita2011549}. Therefore the peak seen in $^{52}$Co at 2.925 MeV could also contain a contribution from an unresolved 1$^+$ level, which is expected to be small since the 0$^+$ contribution is enhanced in the $\\beta$ decay in comparison to CE \\cite{Fujita2011549}. We neglect this contribution in the calculation of $B$(F).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_52Ni.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_52Ni_fit.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\caption{(a) DSSSD charged-particle spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{52}$Ni implants.

This line is found to be coincident with the $\\beta$ bump, as expected. Even if the shape of the 2407 keV peak is distorted, due to the problem affecting the low-amplification electronic chain (see Section \\ref{gamma}), the high statistics allowed us to extract an intensity $I_{\\gamma}$ = 42(10)\\% which agrees well with the value 38(5)\\% from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gamma_52Ni_a.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gamma_52Ni_b.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\caption{$\\gamma$-ray spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{52}$Ni implants.

The total $\\beta$ feeding of the IAS is 56(10)\\% and $B$(F) = 4.2(8), consistent with the expected $B$(F) = 4. The 2.621 MeV level takes most of the GT strength. From $B_p$ and the intensity of the 141 keV $\\gamma$ line we get a total $\\beta$ feeding of 74(8)\\%, thus globally there is a missing $\\beta$ feeding of 26(8)\\% which could belong to other unobserved weak $\\gamma$ or proton branches.\n\nThe IAS in $^{52}$Co decays 75(23)\\% of the time by $\\gamma$ rays and in 25(5)\\% by (isospin-forbidden) proton emission to the ground state in $^{51}$Fe ($J^{\\pi}$ = 5/2$^{-}$). The population of the first excited state at 253 keV ($J^{\\pi}$ = 7/2$^{-}$) in $^{51}$Fe via proton decay would require the observation of a $\\gamma$ ray at 253 keV that we do not see. The $\\gamma$ branch from the IAS proceeds via the $\\gamma$ rays of 2407 and 141 keV which populate the levels in $^{52}$Co at 518 and 378 keV, respectively, while no $\\gamma$ rays are observed from the level at 378 keV. As explained in detail in Section \\ref{masses}, the energy of the 2$^+$ level at 378 keV is assumed from the value in the mirror nucleus $^{52}$Mn, 377.749(5) keV \\cite{NDS2015}, and fixes the excitation energy scale for the $^{52}$Co levels. Barrier-penetration calculations give a partial proton half-life of $t_{1/2}\\sim10^{-15}$ s for the decay of the IAS to the ground state in $^{51}$Fe, and the calculated Weisskopf transition probability for the $\\gamma$ decay of the IAS to the 1$^{+}$ level at 518 keV is of the same order-of-magnitude. In the mirror nucleus $^{52}$Mn the 2$^+$ level at 378 keV is an isomer with a half-life of 21.1 min. Hence the 2$^+$ level in $^{52}$Co is also likely to be an isomeric state decaying by $\\beta$ emission to $^{52}$Fe.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{52Ni_decay_scheme.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Decay scheme of $^{52}$Ni deduced from the present experiment.

However, before the present experiment there was only a little information on the decay of $^{56}$Zn and the excited states of its daughter $^{56}$Cu. The observation of $\\beta$-delayed proton emission was reported in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, but only by improving the statistics and energy resolution it has been possible to perform a fine study of the energy levels in $^{56}$Cu. Moreover, $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays were reported for the first time in the present experiment \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}.\n\nThe correlation-time spectrum for $^{56}$Zn with selection of the proton decays (DSSSD energy above 0.8 MeV) is shown in Fig. \\ref{T56p}. It has already been discussed in Section \\ref{Tfit}. A least squares fit to the data using the function in Eq. \\ref{Eq1} gives a half-life of $T_{1/2}$ = 32.9(8) ms.\n\nFig. \\ref{dsssdbg}c shows the DSSSD charged-particle spectrum obtained for decay events correlated with $^{56}$Zn implants. In this case only a small number of $\\beta$ particles not coincident with protons are observed below 0.8 MeV, while above this energy the decay is dominated by $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. The fit of the six proton peaks identified, shown in Fig. \\ref{MC}b, was performed as explained in Section \\ref{DSSSD}. In the figure the peaks are labelled according to the corresponding excitation energies in $^{56}$Cu, obtained by adding $S_p$ = 560$^\\#$(140$^\\#$) keV \\cite{Audi2003} (see Section \\ref{masses}) to the measured proton energy $E_p$.\n\nThe total proton branching ratio, determined according to the procedure of Section \\ref{Bp}, is $B_p$ = 88.5(26)\\%. We obtain a $B_p$ slightly larger than the value 86.0(49)\\% \\cite{Dossat200718} because, thanks to the higher energy resolution, we were able to identify the first proton peak at $E_p$ = 0.831 MeV ($E_X$ = 1.391 MeV), while in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718} it was assumed proton emission only occurred above 0.9 MeV.\n\nThe comparison of the DSSSD spectrum with the mirror spectrum obtained in the $^{56}$Fe($^{3}$He,$t$)$^{56}$Co CE reaction \\cite{PhysRevC.88.054329} has been already discussed in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. There is a remarkable isospin symmetry. The $^{56}$Cu levels seen in the DSSSD spectrum at $E_X$ = 1.691, 2.537, 2.661 and 3.508 MeV correspond to the $^{56}$Co levels seen in the CE spectrum at 1.720, 2.633, 2.729 and 3.599 MeV. The broader $^{56}$Cu peak at 3.423 MeV contains, unresolved \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}, at least two of the three states seen in $^{56}$Co at 3.432, 3.496 and 3.527 MeV. In addition, the $^{56}$Cu level at 1.391 MeV is the 0$^+$ antianalogue state \\cite{Kampp1978} and corresponds to the $^{56}$Co level at 1.451 MeV, which is not populated in the CE reaction. The 2.633 MeV level is also very-weakly populated in the CE experiment. Thus we expect that the 1.391 and 2.537 MeV levels will only receive a small amount of feeding in the $\\beta$ decay and are populated only indirectly by $\\gamma$ decay from the levels above \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gammas_56Zn.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{$\\gamma$-ray spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{56}$Zn implants in coincidence with protons from the levels at (a) 1.691, (b) 2.661 and (c) 1.391 MeV.}\n\t\\label{gamma56}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nA $\\gamma$-ray spectrum for the decay of $^{56}$Zn has been measured for the first time. In the spectrum, shown in Fig. \\ref{gammabg}c, a $\\gamma$ ray at 1835 keV is observed. Two additional $\\gamma$ rays have been identified at 309 and 861 keV from $\\gamma$-proton coincidences. Fig. \\ref{gamma56} shows the three $\\gamma$ lines.\n\nThe $^{56}$Zn decay scheme is shown in Fig. \\ref{decay56}. Table \\ref{table56} summarizes our results on the $\\beta$ decay of $^{56}$Zn, giving the energies and intensities of the proton and $\\gamma$ peaks, the $\\beta$ feedings, the $B$(F) and $B$(GT) strengths (where we used $Q_{\\beta}$ = 12870$^\\#$(300$^\\#$) keV \\cite{Audi2003}, see Section \\ref{masses}).\n\nThe $^{56}$Zn ground state decays by a Fermi transition to its IAS in $^{56}$Cu. From there, two $\\gamma$ rays of 861 and 1835 keV are emitted, populating the 2.661 and 1.691 MeV levels in $^{56}$Cu, respectively. Due to the low $S_p$, these levels are still proton-unbound and thereafter they both decay by proton emission. Consequently the rare and exotic $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay has been detected for the first time in the $fp$ shell \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. Besides these two branches, there is a third case of a $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton sequence: the 1.691 MeV level emits a $\\gamma$ ray of 309 keV, going to the level at 1.391 MeV that is again proton-unbound and de-excites by proton emission.\n\nThe consequences of the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay on the determination of the $B$(GT) strength near the proton drip-line have been analyzed in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. These findings demonstrate that it is crucial to employ $\\gamma$ detectors in such studies, stressing in particular the importance of carefully correcting the $\\beta$ intensity extracted from the proton transitions for the amount of indirect feeding coming from the $\\gamma$ de-excitation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{56Zn_decay_scheme.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-10.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Decay scheme of $^{56}$Zn deduced from results of the present experiment. The dashed lines represent transitions observed in the mirror $^{56}$Co nucleus.}\n\t\\label{decay56}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nCompetition between $\\beta$-delayed proton emission and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ de-excitation is observed from the 3.508 MeV IAS in $^{56}$Cu. The $\\gamma$ decays represent 56(6)\\% of the total decays. The de-excitation of this $T$ = 2, $J^\\pi = 0^+$ IAS via proton decay to the ground state of $^{55}$Ni ($T$ = 1/2, $J^\\pi = 7/2^-$) is isospin-forbidden. Therefore the 44(6)\\% proton emission that we observe can only happen because of a $T$ = 1 isospin impurity. Moreover, we have found evidence for fragmentation of the Fermi strength due to strong isospin mixing with a 0$^{+}$ state lying inside the 3.423 MeV peak \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. The isospin impurity in the $^{56}$Cu IAS, $\\alpha^2$ = 33(10)\\%, and the off-diagonal matrix element of the charge-dependent part of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle{H_c}\\right\\rangle$ = 40(23) keV, responsible for the isospin mixing of the 3.508 MeV IAS ($T$ = 2, $J^\\pi = 0^+$) and the 0$^{+}$ part of the 3423 keV level ($T$ = 1), agrees with the values obtained in the mirror nucleus $^{56}$Co \\cite{PhysRevC.88.054329}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\t\\caption{Summary of the results for the $\\beta^{+}$ decay of $^{56}$Zn.

However, considering the quite large isospin mixing in $^{56}$Cu, the much faster proton decay ($t_{1/2}\\sim~10^{-18}$ s) should dominate on the $\\gamma$ de-excitation ($t_{1/2}\\sim~10^{-14}$ s in the mirror). This is not the case since we are still observing the $\\gamma$ decay of the IAS in competition with it. Knowledge of the nuclear structure of the three nuclei involved in the decay, {\\it i.e.}, $^{56}$Zn, $^{56}$Cu and $^{55}$Ni, may provide us with a possible explanation for the hindrance of the proton decay, as discussed in Ref. \\cite{Rubio}.\n\\\\\n\nShell model calculations are in progress to corroborate these ideas \\cite{Poves}. The preliminary results give a spectroscopic factor of 10$^{-3}$ for the proton decay of the $T$ = 1 component of the IAS to the ground state of $^{55}$Ni. They also confirm the amount of isospin mixing observed.\n\n\\section{\\label{masses}Determination of the masses}\n\nA knowledge of the masses of the proton-rich nuclei under study and their daughters is important for the determination of some key quantities. The difference between the mass excesses of the parent and $\\beta$-daughter nuclei gives the $Q_{\\beta}$ value of the decay, which enters in the determination of the $\\beta$-decay strengths (see Section \\ref{strength}). In addition, the information on the mass excess of the proton-daughter after the $\\beta$ decay and of the $\\beta$-daughter allows the calculation of the proton separation energy $S_p$ which, together with the measured proton energy $E_p$, provides the excitation energy of the levels populated in the daughter nucleus as $E_X=E_p + S_p$.  \n\nIf the mass excesses of at least three members of an isospin multiplet are known then the mass excess of the remaining member can be determined by the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation (IMME) \\cite{IMMEpaper,IMME,MacCormick201461}:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 41990, "prevtext": "\n\n\n", "index": 15, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  B_j(\\mathrm{GT}) = \\frac{K}{\\lambda^{2}}~\\frac{I_{\\beta}^{j}(E_j)}{f_j~T_{1/2}}\\,,\n  \\label{Eq8}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"B_{j}(\\mathrm{GT})=\\frac{K}{\\lambda^{2}}~{}\\frac{I_{\\beta}^{j}(E_{j})}{f_{j}~{%&#10;}T_{1/2}}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>B</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>GT</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mfrac><mi>K</mi><msup><mi>\u03bb</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>I</mi><mi>\u03b2</mi><mi>j</mi></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>j</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mfrac></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03983.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nIn the present section we determine the mass excesses of the $T_z$ = -2 nuclei $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn using the IMME with four members of each multiplet.\n\nFor the $A$ = 48, $T$ = 2, $J^{\\pi}$ = 0$^{+}$ mass multiplet we consider the following mass excesses: the $^{48}$Ti ground state (-48491.7(4) keV \\cite{Audi2012}); the IAS in $^{48}$V (-41458.8(14) keV), obtained from the ground state mass in Ref. \\cite{Audi2012} and the most recent measurement of the IAS excitation energy \\cite{Ela2015}; the IAS in $^{48}$Cr (-34067(17) keV \\cite{Audi2012,NDS2006}); the IAS in $^{48}$Mn (-26254(12) keV), which we determine from the mass excess of $^{47}$Cr \\cite{Audi2012} and our measured $E_p$ = 1018(10) keV (see Table \\ref{table48}).

We also take the mass excess of the IAS in $^{56}$Co (-52461(2) keV), obtained from the ground state mass in Ref. \\cite{Audi2012} and the high-resolution CE measurement \\cite{PhysRevC.88.054329}, where we have used the excitation energy of the unperturbed $T$ = 2 state taking into account the isospin mixing observed. Finally, we also use the mass excess of the IAS in $^{56}$Cu (-35128(66) keV), which we determine from the mass excess of $^{55}$Ni \\cite{Audi2012} and our measured $E_p$ = 2948(10) keV (see Table \\ref{table56}), where similarly we have calculated the unperturbed energy for the $T$ = 2 state considering the isospin mixing.

The comparison is also shown in Fig. \\ref{mass}, where we plot the differences between our IMME values and the 2003 AME and 2012 AME values. For all the nuclei, the values from the 2003 AME lie much closer to our IMME estimates than the 2012 AME ones, which agree only thanks to the larger error bars. A measurement of these masses would be important to constrain the future AME.

This is not possible for $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn, where no mass measurement for the daughter exists and therefore, in view of the rather large discrepancies observed in Fig. \\ref{mass}, we have to rely on mirror symmetry.\n\n$^{48}$Fe. Starting from the mass of the IAS in $^{48}$Mn (-26254(12) keV, see above), the ground state mass of $^{48}$Mn can be determined by subtracting the energies of the de-exciting $\\gamma$-ray cascade (see Table \\ref{table48}). We obtain -29290(12) keV, which agrees with the 2012 AME measured value of -29320(170) keV. Finally, using our derived (more precise) value, we calculate $Q_{\\beta}$ = 11202(19) keV for the decay of $^{48}$Fe and $S_p$ = 2018(10) keV in $^{48}$Mn.\n\n$^{56}$Zn. For $^{56}$Zn we presented in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501} the complete strength calculations for both AMEs. The difference in the $B$(F) and $B$(GT) strengths obtained with the two AMEs is tiny (see Table II of Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}) and the values agree well within the errors. However, we already noticed that the energies of the mirror levels in $^{56}$Cu and $^{56}$Co agree within 100 keV when the 2003 AME \\cite{Audi2003} is used, while they differ by $\\sim400$ keV if using the 2012 AME \\cite{Audi2012}. Therefore we argued that the 2003 AME gives a more reasonable value for the energy of the IAS. The IMME calculation for the mass excess of the $^{56}$Zn ground state corroborates that the systematic value from the 2003 AME lies closer to the $expected~value$ than the 2012 AME one. Hence in the present paper we continue to prefer the 2003 AME \\cite{Audi2003} values and so we use $Q_{\\beta}$ = 12870$^\\#$(300$^\\#$) keV for the decay of $^{56}$Zn and $S_p$ = 560$^\\#$(140$^\\#$) keV in $^{56}$Cu.\n\n$^{52}$Ni. In order to determine the ground state mass of $^{52}$Co, we can again start from the IAS in $^{52}$Co (-31561(13) keV, see above) and subtract the energies of the observed de-exciting $\\gamma$ rays (see Table \\ref{table52}) up to the first excited 2$^+$ state in $^{52}$Co. At this point we have assumed an energy for this 2$^+$ state, which we take from the value in the mirror nucleus $^{52}$Mn, 378 keV \\cite{NDS2015}. In this way we obtain a ground state mass excess of -34486(14) keV in $^{52}$Co. Based on this number and our deduced mass for $^{52}$Ni, we calculate $Q_{\\beta}$ = 11533(21) keV for the decay of $^{52}$Ni and $S_p$ = 1573(10) keV in $^{52}$Co.\n\n\\section{\\label{concl}Conclusions}\n\nIn the present paper we reported on a study of the $\\beta$ decays of  the $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn nuclei, performed at GANIL. These three exotic nuclei lie close to the proton drip-line and have a third component of isospin $T_z$ = -2.\n\nIn the first half of the paper we have extensively described the experiment and data analysis procedures, taking $^{56}$Zn as an example and discussing differences in the analysis of $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni. The results obtained for each of the three nuclei have been presented in the second half of the paper.\n\nWe have extracted the half-life and the total $\\beta$-delayed proton emission branching ratio for all of the nuclei under study. Individual $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays have been measured and the related branching ratios have been determined, most of them for the first time. Decay schemes have been determined for the three nuclei. The higher energy resolution achieved for protons, in comparison to a previous study, allowed us to identify new states populated in the decays of $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni and to establish for the first time the decay scheme of $^{56}$Zn. We have used the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation to deduce the mass excesses of the nuclei under study using information from our experimental data and the literature. Moreover we have determined the absolute Fermi and Gamow-Teller transition strengths. \n\nIn $^{48}$Fe, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn the de-excitation of the $T$ = 2 IAS via $\\beta$-delayed proton emission is isospin-forbidden, however it is observed in all cases. This is attributed to a $T$ = 1 isospin impurity in the IAS wave function. Furthermore, we have observed in all three nuclei competition between $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays. Nevertheless, while for $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ de-excitation of the IAS dominates (87\\% and 75\\%, respectively), in $^{56}$Zn the $\\gamma$ decays are only 56\\% of the total decays from the IAS.\n\nThe case of $^{56}$Zn is, indeed, peculiar for various reasons. The comparison with the mirror CE experiment shows, only for this nucleus, that there is another 0$^{+}$, $T$ = 1 state which mixes at 33\\% with the IAS, making the proton decay allowed. Another interesting feature is that in $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni the calculated partial proton half-lives are of the same order-of-magnitude of the $\\gamma$-decay Weisskopf transition probabilities. Differently, in $^{56}$Zn the proton decay is expected to be four orders-of-magnitude faster than the $\\gamma$ de-excitation. However, the latter is still observed. This indicates some hindrance of the proton decay. The explanation may lie on nuclear structure reasons, as explained in Ref. \\cite{Rubio}. Shell model calculations are in progress \\cite{Poves} and the preliminary results confirm the amount of isospin mixing experimentally observed and the hindrance of the proton decay.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThis work was supported by the Spanish MICINN grants FPA2008-06419-C02-01, FPA2011-24553; Centro de Excelencia Severo Ochoa del IFIC SEV-2014-0398; CPAN Consolider-Ingenio 2010 Programme CSD2007-00042; $Junta~para~la~Ampliaci\\acute{o}n~de~Estudios$ Programme (CSIC JAE-Doc contract) co-financed by FSE; ENSAR project 262010; MEXT, Japan 18540270 and 22540310; Japan-Spain coll. program of JSPS and CSIC; Istanbul University Scientific Research Projects, Num. 5808; UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) Grant No. ST/F012012/1; Region of Aquitaine.

The improved resolution, together with the increased statistics, allowed us to establish for the first time the decay scheme of $^{56}$Zn and to observe the exotic $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}.\n\nNew and detailed spectroscopic information has also been obtained on the $\\beta$ decays of $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni thanks to the improved experimental conditions. The decay schemes of $^{48}$Fe and $^{52}$Ni have been enriched with many new states identified in the corresponding daughter nuclei, and the $\\beta$-decay strengths have been extracted.\n\nThe details for each of the three nuclei under study are discussed in the following sections.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{48Fe}Beta decay of $^{48}$Fe}\n\nThe $^{48}$Fe nucleus was detected for the first time at GANIL \\cite{Pougheon1987}. Results from decay studies were presented in Refs. \\cite{Faux1996167,Dossat200718}.\n\nFig. \\ref{T48p} shows the correlation-time spectrum for $^{48}$Fe obtained in our experiment, where the proton decays with energy above 0.94 MeV have been selected in the DSSSD and the region corresponding to the $^{49}$Fe impurity (see below) has also been removed. The half-life is determined by a least squares fit to the data with the function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}, including the $\\beta$ decay of $^{48}$Fe and a constant background. A half-life $T_{1/2}$ = 52(2) ms is obtained.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.\\columnwidth]{Halflife48.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between all the $^{48}$Fe implants and each proton decay (DSSSD energy $E_p>$ 0.94 MeV, with the additional condition $E_p\\notin$[1.85,2.23] MeV to remove the $^{49}$Fe contaminant).}\n\t\\label{T48p}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe charged-particle spectrum measured in the DSSSD for decay events correlated with $^{48}$Fe implants is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssd48}a. The large bump observed at low energy is due to the detection of $\\beta$ particles not coincident with protons. Nine discrete peaks are identified above this bump and interpreted as being due to $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. They are fitted as explained in Section \\ref{DSSSD}. The fit is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssd48}b where the peaks are labelled according to the corresponding excitation energies in $^{48}$Mn, obtained as $E_X=E_p + S_p$ with $S_p$ = 2018(10) keV (see Section \\ref{masses}). The proton decay of the IAS is identified at $E_X$ = 3.036 MeV as in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_48Fe.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_48Fe_fit.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{(a) DSSSD charged-particle spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{48}$Fe implants.  (b) Fit of the peaks related to the proton emission following the $\\beta$ decay of $^{48}$Fe.

The peak labelled as $^{49}$Fe is due to a residual contamination from this isotope.}\n\t\\label{dsssd48}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe additional peak visible at $E_p\\approx$ 2 MeV is due to a residual contribution of the $^{49}$Fe contaminant. As explained in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, the background subtraction procedure cannot remove completely the activity of very strongly produced isotopes such as $^{49}$Fe. By imposing an increasingly restricted identification cut on $^{48}$Fe we can progressively get rid of the $^{49}$Fe contaminant, but at the price of poorer statistics. We have chosen the reasonable compromise of obtaining a good separation between the residual $^{49}$Fe peak and the $^{48}$Fe peaks. We have also checked that there is no visible contribution from $^{48}$Fe below the $^{49}$Fe peak. Therefore in the construction of the correlation-time spectrum, besides imposing a DSSSD threshold of 0.94 MeV, we have also removed the energy region corresponding to the $^{49}$Fe peak by imposing $E_p\\notin$[1.85,2.23] MeV. In this way we get a $B_p$ = 13.9(7)\\% which is slightly smaller than the value of 15.9(6)\\%, obtained in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718} without removing the residual $^{49}$Fe impurity. If we include the $^{49}$Fe peak we get 15.1(7)\\%, in agreement with Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\nThe $\\gamma$-ray spectrum measured in coincidence with all the decays correlated with the $^{48}$Fe implants is shown in Fig. \\ref{gamma48}. Three $\\gamma$ lines are observed at 90, 98 and 313 keV. The fourth line visible in Fig. \\ref{gamma48} at 261 keV comes from the residual $^{49}$Fe contaminant. A further $\\gamma$ ray of 2633 keV is expected in the decay of $^{48}$Fe \\cite{Dossat200718}, which we can only partially observe because of the problem affecting the low-amplification electronic chain (see Section \\ref{gamma}). Thus in this particular case we took $I_{\\gamma}$ = 30(5)\\% from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718} to calculate the $\\beta$-decay strength.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gamma_48Fe.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{$\\gamma$-ray spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{48}$Fe implants.}\n\t\\label{gamma48}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gp98_48Fe.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{DSSSD charged-particle spectrum correlated with $^{48}$Fe implants.

As expected, the $\\gamma$ lines at 90 and 313 keV are found to be coincident with the $\\beta$ bump. The 98 keV line comes from the decay of the first excited state to the ground state in the proton-daughter $^{47}$Cr \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\nThe DSSSD spectrum gated on the $\\gamma$ line at 98 keV, corrected by the corresponding $\\gamma$ efficiency, is shown in Fig. \\ref{gp98} (dashed-red histogram) and compared with the full DSSD spectrum (black-empty histogram). The 98 keV $\\gamma$ ray is found in coincidence with part of the 3.619 MeV proton peak, indicating that this part of the strength comes from the decay of the 3.713 MeV level to the first excited state of $^{47}$Cr. In addition, the energy difference between the two levels is consistent with the energy of the $\\gamma$ line. The intensities of the 3.619 and 3.713 MeV peaks have been corrected accordingly. In a similar way, the intensities of the triplet of peaks at around 4.4 MeV have also been corrected. Finally, the small peak at $E_p\\approx$ 0.91 MeV is attributed to the decay of the IAS to the first excited state in $^{47}$Cr, and the IAS intensity has been corrected accordingly.\n\nThe coincidence with the 98 keV $\\gamma$ ray selects proton-decay events only. The half-life associated with the $\\gamma$ line at 98 keV is 52(3) ms, which agrees well with the $^{48}$Fe half-life of 52(2) ms obtained in Fig. \\ref{T48p}. This is an additional confirmation that the fit in Fig. \\ref{T48p} is not affected by some possible residual contribution from the $\\beta$ tail in the region $E_p>$ 0.94 MeV.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{48Fe_decay_scheme.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Decay scheme of $^{48}$Fe deduced from the present experiment.}\n\t\\label{decay48}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\t\\caption{Summary of the results for the $\\beta^{+}$ decay of $^{48}$Fe.

Indeed barrier-penetration calculations give a partial proton half-life of $t_{1/2}\\sim10^{-17}$ s, an order-of-magnitude where the $\\gamma$ de-excitation can compete with the proton emission, which is also isospin-forbidden. From our data, each 100 decays from the IAS divide into 13(2) proton decays to the ground state of $^{47}$Cr, and 87(19) $\\gamma$ decays to the ground state of $^{48}$Mn. The two possible decay modes of the IAS give two independent determinations of the excitation energy of the IAS. From our measured proton energy and the experimental mass excess of the ground states in $^{47}$Cr and $^{48}$Mn \\cite{Audi2012} we get $E_X^{IAS}$ = 3.066(170) MeV, while from the summing of the energies of the de-exciting $\\gamma$ lines we obtain $E_X^{IAS}$ = 3.036(2) MeV. The two values agree well with each other and the second is more precise.\n\nThe total $\\beta$ feeding of the IAS is 34.7(50)\\% and $B$(F) = 2.8(4). In order to get the expected $B$(F) = $|N-Z|$ = 4 we calculated that the $\\beta$ feeding should be 50(13)\\%. A possible explanation for the missing IAS feeding could be that there are other weak $\\gamma$ branches which are not observed. In addition, we took the intensity of the 2633 keV $\\gamma$ line from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, where there is also missing IAS feeding and the authors considered the possibility of an overestimation of the $\\gamma$ efficiency at that energy. \n \nConsidering $B_p$ and the intensity of the 90 keV $\\gamma$ line, we get a total $\\beta$ feeding of 84(13)\\%, thus globally there is a missing $\\beta$ feeding of 16(13)\\%. This value is compatible with the missing feeding in the IAS, however the sizable uncertainty lets us explore an additional hypothesis. In the mirror nucleus $^{48}$V two 1$^{+}$ states are observed at 2.288 and 2.406 MeV, also seen in a recent measurement of the charge exchange (CE) reaction $^{48}$Ti($^{3}$He,$t$)$^{48}$V \\cite{Ela2015}. Due to the mirror symmetry, these states should also exist in $^{48}$Mn and they could explain part of the missing feeding. However we cannot make a conclusive statement about this hypothesis because we do not see any $\\gamma$ line compatible with their population or de-excitation, although the statistics expected for these weak lines may place them below our sensitivity limit. In addition the corresponding proton decay from these 1$^{+}$ states is expected at $E_p$ around 300-400 keV and so the corresponding peaks, if they exist, would lie beneath the $\\beta$ bump, making it impossible to identify them in the DSSSD spectrum. In Fig. \\ref{gp98}, however, the coincidence with the 98 keV $\\gamma$ ray suppresses the $\\beta$ bump and a group of peaks is visible in the region 200-500 keV, which are compatible with the expected energies. We calculated the barrier-penetration half-life for the expected protons and found it to be in the range 10$^{-10}$-10$^{-7}$ s, while the partial half-life for $\\gamma$ decay using Weisskopf estimation is around 10$^{-15}$-10$^{-14}$ s. Therefore the gamma decay should dominate unless additional reasons, lying in the structure of the nuclear states involved, would favour the proton decay. \n\n\\subsection{\\label{52Ni}Beta decay of $^{52}$Ni}\n\n$^{52}$Ni was observed for the first time in an experiment carried out at GANIL \\cite{Pougheon1987}. The decay of $^{52}$Ni was studied in Refs. \\cite{PhysRevC.49.2440,Dossat200718}.\n\nFig. \\ref{T52p} shows the correlation-time spectrum obtained for $^{52}$Ni in our experiment, where the proton decays have been selected by putting a threshold of 0.98 MeV on the energy in the DSSSD. The data are fitted with the function of Eq. \\ref{Eq1}, including the $\\beta$ decay of $^{52}$Ni and a constant background. A half-life of 42.8(3) ms is obtained. The total proton branching ratio is determined as explained in Section \\ref{Bp}. We obtain $B_p$ = 31.1(5)\\%, in good agreement with the value 31.4(15)\\% from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1.\\columnwidth]{Halflife52.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Spectrum of the time correlations between each proton decay (DSSSD energy $>$ 0.98 MeV) and all the $^{52}$Ni implants.}\n\t\\label{T52p}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFig. \\ref{dsssd52}a shows the DSSSD charged-particle spectrum obtained for decay events correlated with $^{52}$Ni implants. The bump observed below 1 MeV is attributed to $\\beta$ particles not coincident with protons. Ten discrete peaks are identified above this bump and interpreted as being due to $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. The fit to these peaks, performed as explained in Section \\ref{DSSSD}, is shown in Fig. \\ref{dsssd52}b. The peaks are labelled according to the corresponding excitation energies in $^{52}$Co, obtained by adding $S_p$ = 1573(10) keV (see Section \\ref{masses}) to the measured proton energy $E_p$ in each case.\n\nThe DSSSD spectrum can be compared to the spectrum obtained from the mirror CE experiment, the reaction $^{52}$Cr($^{3}$He,$t$)$^{52}$Mn (see Fig. 45a in Ref. \\cite{Fujita2011549}). All the dominant transitions are observed in both spectra, showing a good isospin symmetry. In detail, the $^{52}$Mn peaks seen in the CE spectrum at $E_X$ = 2.636, 3.585, 4.390 and 5.090 MeV correspond to the $^{52}$Co peaks seen in the DSSSD spectrum at $E_X$ = 2.621, 3.523, 4.375 and 5.024 MeV. In addition we see other small peaks at $E_X$ = 3.148, 3.254, 3.410, 3.634 and 4.461 MeV which seem to be only very weakly populated in the mirror CE process.\n\nMoreover, we observe a strong peak at $E_X$ = 2.925 MeV which is identified as the proton decay of the $^{52}$Co IAS, as in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}. The higher energy resolution of the CE reaction allows the separation of two $^{52}$Mn states lying close in energy, at 2.875(1$^+$) and 2.938(0$^+$) MeV \\cite{Fujita2011549}. Therefore the peak seen in $^{52}$Co at 2.925 MeV could also contain a contribution from an unresolved 1$^+$ level, which is expected to be small since the 0$^+$ contribution is enhanced in the $\\beta$ decay in comparison to CE \\cite{Fujita2011549}. We neglect this contribution in the calculation of $B$(F).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_52Ni.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{DSSSD_52Ni_fit.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\caption{(a) DSSSD charged-particle spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{52}$Ni implants.

Two $\\gamma$ lines are observed at 141 and 2407 keV, also seen in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}. We determine for the first time the intensity of the 141 keV line, $I_{\\gamma}$ = 43(8)\\%. This line is found to be coincident with the $\\beta$ bump, as expected. Even if the shape of the 2407 keV peak is distorted, due to the problem affecting the low-amplification electronic chain (see Section \\ref{gamma}), the high statistics allowed us to extract an intensity $I_{\\gamma}$ = 42(10)\\% which agrees well with the value 38(5)\\% from Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gamma_52Ni_a.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\begin{minipage}{1.0\\linewidth}\n\t  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gamma_52Ni_b.pdf}\n\t\\end{minipage}\n\t\\caption{$\\gamma$-ray spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{52}$Ni implants.

The total $\\beta$ feeding of the IAS is 56(10)\\% and $B$(F) = 4.2(8), consistent with the expected $B$(F) = 4. The 2.621 MeV level takes most of the GT strength. From $B_p$ and the intensity of the 141 keV $\\gamma$ line we get a total $\\beta$ feeding of 74(8)\\%, thus globally there is a missing $\\beta$ feeding of 26(8)\\% which could belong to other unobserved weak $\\gamma$ or proton branches.\n\nThe IAS in $^{52}$Co decays 75(23)\\% of the time by $\\gamma$ rays and in 25(5)\\% by (isospin-forbidden) proton emission to the ground state in $^{51}$Fe ($J^{\\pi}$ = 5/2$^{-}$). The population of the first excited state at 253 keV ($J^{\\pi}$ = 7/2$^{-}$) in $^{51}$Fe via proton decay would require the observation of a $\\gamma$ ray at 253 keV that we do not see. The $\\gamma$ branch from the IAS proceeds via the $\\gamma$ rays of 2407 and 141 keV which populate the levels in $^{52}$Co at 518 and 378 keV, respectively, while no $\\gamma$ rays are observed from the level at 378 keV. As explained in detail in Section \\ref{masses}, the energy of the 2$^+$ level at 378 keV is assumed from the value in the mirror nucleus $^{52}$Mn, 377.749(5) keV \\cite{NDS2015}, and fixes the excitation energy scale for the $^{52}$Co levels. Barrier-penetration calculations give a partial proton half-life of $t_{1/2}\\sim10^{-15}$ s for the decay of the IAS to the ground state in $^{51}$Fe, and the calculated Weisskopf transition probability for the $\\gamma$ decay of the IAS to the 1$^{+}$ level at 518 keV is of the same order-of-magnitude. In the mirror nucleus $^{52}$Mn the 2$^+$ level at 378 keV is an isomer with a half-life of 21.1 min. Hence the 2$^+$ level in $^{52}$Co is also likely to be an isomeric state decaying by $\\beta$ emission to $^{52}$Fe.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{52Ni_decay_scheme.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Decay scheme of $^{52}$Ni deduced from the present experiment.

However, before the present experiment there was only a little information on the decay of $^{56}$Zn and the excited states of its daughter $^{56}$Cu. The observation of $\\beta$-delayed proton emission was reported in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718}, but only by improving the statistics and energy resolution it has been possible to perform a fine study of the energy levels in $^{56}$Cu. Moreover, $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays were reported for the first time in the present experiment \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}.\n\nThe correlation-time spectrum for $^{56}$Zn with selection of the proton decays (DSSSD energy above 0.8 MeV) is shown in Fig. \\ref{T56p}. It has already been discussed in Section \\ref{Tfit}. A least squares fit to the data using the function in Eq. \\ref{Eq1} gives a half-life of $T_{1/2}$ = 32.9(8) ms.\n\nFig. \\ref{dsssdbg}c shows the DSSSD charged-particle spectrum obtained for decay events correlated with $^{56}$Zn implants. In this case only a small number of $\\beta$ particles not coincident with protons are observed below 0.8 MeV, while above this energy the decay is dominated by $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. The fit of the six proton peaks identified, shown in Fig. \\ref{MC}b, was performed as explained in Section \\ref{DSSSD}. In the figure the peaks are labelled according to the corresponding excitation energies in $^{56}$Cu, obtained by adding $S_p$ = 560$^\\#$(140$^\\#$) keV \\cite{Audi2003} (see Section \\ref{masses}) to the measured proton energy $E_p$.\n\nThe total proton branching ratio, determined according to the procedure of Section \\ref{Bp}, is $B_p$ = 88.5(26)\\%. We obtain a $B_p$ slightly larger than the value 86.0(49)\\% \\cite{Dossat200718} because, thanks to the higher energy resolution, we were able to identify the first proton peak at $E_p$ = 0.831 MeV ($E_X$ = 1.391 MeV), while in Ref. \\cite{Dossat200718} it was assumed proton emission only occurred above 0.9 MeV.\n\nThe comparison of the DSSSD spectrum with the mirror spectrum obtained in the $^{56}$Fe($^{3}$He,$t$)$^{56}$Co CE reaction \\cite{PhysRevC.88.054329} has been already discussed in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. There is a remarkable isospin symmetry. The $^{56}$Cu levels seen in the DSSSD spectrum at $E_X$ = 1.691, 2.537, 2.661 and 3.508 MeV correspond to the $^{56}$Co levels seen in the CE spectrum at 1.720, 2.633, 2.729 and 3.599 MeV. The broader $^{56}$Cu peak at 3.423 MeV contains, unresolved \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}, at least two of the three states seen in $^{56}$Co at 3.432, 3.496 and 3.527 MeV. In addition, the $^{56}$Cu level at 1.391 MeV is the 0$^+$ antianalogue state \\cite{Kampp1978} and corresponds to the $^{56}$Co level at 1.451 MeV, which is not populated in the CE reaction. The 2.633 MeV level is also very-weakly populated in the CE experiment. Thus we expect that the 1.391 and 2.537 MeV levels will only receive a small amount of feeding in the $\\beta$ decay and are populated only indirectly by $\\gamma$ decay from the levels above \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{gammas_56Zn.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{$\\gamma$-ray spectrum for decay events correlated with $^{56}$Zn implants in coincidence with protons from the levels at (a) 1.691, (b) 2.661 and (c) 1.391 MeV.}\n\t\\label{gamma56}\n  \\vspace{-5.0 mm}\n\\end{figure}\n\nA $\\gamma$-ray spectrum for the decay of $^{56}$Zn has been measured for the first time. In the spectrum, shown in Fig. \\ref{gammabg}c, a $\\gamma$ ray at 1835 keV is observed. Two additional $\\gamma$ rays have been identified at 309 and 861 keV from $\\gamma$-proton coincidences. Fig. \\ref{gamma56} shows the three $\\gamma$ lines.\n\nThe $^{56}$Zn decay scheme is shown in Fig. \\ref{decay56}. Table \\ref{table56} summarizes our results on the $\\beta$ decay of $^{56}$Zn, giving the energies and intensities of the proton and $\\gamma$ peaks, the $\\beta$ feedings, the $B$(F) and $B$(GT) strengths (where we used $Q_{\\beta}$ = 12870$^\\#$(300$^\\#$) keV \\cite{Audi2003}, see Section \\ref{masses}).\n\nThe $^{56}$Zn ground state decays by a Fermi transition to its IAS in $^{56}$Cu. From there, two $\\gamma$ rays of 861 and 1835 keV are emitted, populating the 2.661 and 1.691 MeV levels in $^{56}$Cu, respectively. Due to the low $S_p$, these levels are still proton-unbound and thereafter they both decay by proton emission. Consequently the rare and exotic $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay has been detected for the first time in the $fp$ shell \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. Besides these two branches, there is a third case of a $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton sequence: the 1.691 MeV level emits a $\\gamma$ ray of 309 keV, going to the level at 1.391 MeV that is again proton-unbound and de-excites by proton emission.\n\nThe consequences of the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay on the determination of the $B$(GT) strength near the proton drip-line have been analyzed in Ref. \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. These findings demonstrate that it is crucial to employ $\\gamma$ detectors in such studies, stressing in particular the importance of carefully correcting the $\\beta$ intensity extracted from the proton transitions for the amount of indirect feeding coming from the $\\gamma$ de-excitation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{56Zn_decay_scheme.pdf}\n  \\vspace{-10.0 mm}\n\t\\caption{Decay scheme of $^{56}$Zn deduced from results of the present experiment.

The $\\gamma$ decays represent 56(6)\\% of the total decays. The de-excitation of this $T$ = 2, $J^\\pi = 0^+$ IAS via proton decay to the ground state of $^{55}$Ni ($T$ = 1/2, $J^\\pi = 7/2^-$) is isospin-forbidden. Therefore the 44(6)\\% proton emission that we observe can only happen because of a $T$ = 1 isospin impurity. Moreover, we have found evidence for fragmentation of the Fermi strength due to strong isospin mixing with a 0$^{+}$ state lying inside the 3.423 MeV peak \\cite{PhysRevLett.112.222501}. The isospin impurity in the $^{56}$Cu IAS, $\\alpha^2$ = 33(10)\\%, and the off-diagonal matrix element of the charge-dependent part of the Hamiltonian, $\\left\\langle{H_c}\\right\\rangle$ = 40(23) keV, responsible for the isospin mixing of the 3.508 MeV IAS ($T$ = 2, $J^\\pi = 0^+$) and the 0$^{+}$ part of the 3423 keV level ($T$ = 1), agrees with the values obtained in the mirror nucleus $^{56}$Co \\cite{PhysRevC.88.054329}.\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\t\\caption{Summary of the results for the $\\beta^{+}$ decay of $^{56}$Zn.

However, considering the quite large isospin mixing in $^{56}$Cu, the much faster proton decay ($t_{1/2}\\sim~10^{-18}$ s) should dominate on the $\\gamma$ de-excitation ($t_{1/2}\\sim~10^{-14}$ s in the mirror). This is not the case since we are still observing the $\\gamma$ decay of the IAS in competition with it. Knowledge of the nuclear structure of the three nuclei involved in the decay, {\\it i.e.}, $^{56}$Zn, $^{56}$Cu and $^{55}$Ni, may provide us with a possible explanation for the hindrance of the proton decay, as discussed in Ref. \\cite{Rubio}.\n\\\\\n\nShell model calculations are in progress to corroborate these ideas \\cite{Poves}. The preliminary results give a spectroscopic factor of 10$^{-3}$ for the proton decay of the $T$ = 1 component of the IAS to the ground state of $^{55}$Ni. They also confirm the amount of isospin mixing observed.\n\n\\section{\\label{masses}Determination of the masses}\n\nA knowledge of the masses of the proton-rich nuclei under study and their daughters is important for the determination of some key quantities. The difference between the mass excesses of the parent and $\\beta$-daughter nuclei gives the $Q_{\\beta}$ value of the decay, which enters in the determination of the $\\beta$-decay strengths (see Section \\ref{strength}). In addition, the information on the mass excess of the proton-daughter after the $\\beta$ decay and of the $\\beta$-daughter allows the calculation of the proton separation energy $S_p$ which, together with the measured proton energy $E_p$, provides the excitation energy of the levels populated in the daughter nucleus as $E_X=E_p + S_p$.  \n\nIf the mass excesses of at least three members of an isospin multiplet are known then the mass excess of the remaining member can be determined by the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation (IMME) \\cite{IMMEpaper,IMME,MacCormick201461}:\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta m(\\alpha,T,T_z) = a + b~T_z + c~T_z^2\\,,\n  \\label{Eq9}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta m(\\alpha,T,T_{z})=a+b~{}T_{z}+c~{}T_{z}^{2}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>T</mi><mo>,</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>z</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>b</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>z</mi></msub></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+3.3pt\"><mi>c</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msubsup><mi>T</mi><mi>z</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
