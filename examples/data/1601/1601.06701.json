The instability of\nthe bcc structure in Li and Na at low temperatures is also reproduced,\nand, unusually, is not due to a soft T1N phonon mode. No forces or finite\ntemperature properties are included in the fit, so this demonstrates a\nsurprisingly high level of intrinsic transferrability in the simple\npotentials. Currently, thee are few potentials available for the alkali metals, so in, addition to demonstrating trends in\nbehaviour, we expect that the potentials will be of broad general use.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe thermodynamic properties of Group 1A metals vary systematically\ndown the group.  Cohesive energies and elastic constants decrease from\nLi-Cs, while lattice parameters increase. This makes them an ideal\ntestground for testing thermodynamic relationships between solid\nproperties and melting points.\n\nMelting points are impossible to calculate analytically, and it is\nwell known that different parameterizations of metal potentials can\ngive very different results for calculated melting points.  Thus to\nexamine trends down a group, we require an analytic description of \ninteratomic interactions.  This means creating an interatomic potential \nfully specified by a small number of materials properties. \n\nWe wish to derive a family of interatomic potentials describing the\nalkali metals which can be used in classical molecular dynamics.  To\nensure comparability, we aim for a form with a minimal number of\nparameters, fully determined by the fitting data. We choose to use the\nsimplest form which describes many-body metallic\ninteractions, the second-moment approximation to tight\nbinding\\cite{ducastelle1970moments,finnis1984simple}. \nThe motivation for this theory comes from the idea of a local density of states projected onto an atom, but the actual potentials are similar in form to  \nthe embedded atom method\\cite{daw1984embedded} (EAM).  This is based on the\nconceptual idea of embedding an atom into a preexisting charge\ndensity, and calculating the energy change.\n\nIn either case the energy is written as:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{U} = \\sum_i{F({\\rho}_i)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j\\neq i}{{V}_{ij}(r_{ij})}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathcal{U}=\\sum_{i}{F({\\rho}_{i})}+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j\\neq i}{{V}_{ij}(r_{ij%&#10;})}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcb0</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></munder><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><mo>\u2260</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></munder><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06701.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\nFor elements where binding comes from a\nsingle band, the second-moment approach to second moment potentials\ngives $F=\\sqrt{}$, although for materials where binding comes from two\nbands this is more complicated\\cite{ackland2003two,ackland2006two}.\nFor alloys, another subtle difference arises.

These properties are\nindependent of the final parameter $a_6$, which controls the short\nranged repulsion inside the perfect crystal nearest neighbour\ndistance.

The $r_k$ parameters were set\nto be the same for all elements, as a fraction of lattice parameter (see Table 1).\n\nThe square root dependence appears to make the fitting nonlinear,\nhowever this nonlinearity can be transferred from the fitting to the\ndata being fitted. Specifically, the many-body term's parameters\n$A_k$ can be fully determined by linear fit to two quantities which\nare explicitly zero for any pair potential, i.e.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\nthe difference between vacancy formation energy and cohesive energy $(E_{coh}-E_{vac})$\n\\item the Cauchy Pressure  $C_{12}-C_{44}$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe pair-potential parameters $a_i$ can then be determined by a linear\nfit to the difference between the required property and the\ncontribution from the many-body term.

A solid/liquid interface\nis present at the start of the simulation and the particle velocities\nare initialised to approximate the anticipated coexistence\ntemperature. The total enthalpy of the system is held constant, in an\nNPE ensemble, so that if the initial temperature is below (above)\n$T_m$ the phase boundary will move and some of the sample will freeze\n(melt).  The ``ringing mode'' is eliminated in an initial\nequilibration phase by setting the first time derivatives of the Nose\nand Parrinello-Rahman extended Lagrangian parameters to zero whenever\ntheir sign differs from the second derivative.  This algorithm does\nnot correspond to any Lagrangian, but very efficiently removes energy\nfrom ringing modes.  After a short equilibration period, when the\nenergy in the fictitious dynamic modes approaches kT, we continue\nproduction runs with the standard NPE Lagrangian.  This process proved\nnecessary because of the poor coupling between the fictitious degrees\nof freedom and the rest of the system.  We note that the same ringing\nbehaviour is present in the NVE ensemble, manifesting itself as an\noscillation in the internal pressure.\n     \nOn a timescale much longer than the\nringing mode equilibration, the latent heat released during the\ntransition increases (decreases) the temperature of the sample until\nit reaches $T_m$.  We used a supercell with 17576 atoms (initialised\nwith 8788 atoms of bcc: $13 \\times 13 \\times 26$, and a similar amount\nof melt).  Convergence was checked by comparing several runs\ninitialising the temperature above and below the expected melt point,\nand observing that in each case the simulation went to the same final\ntemperature.  The final configurations were visualized using VMD\n\\cite{VMD} to verify that both crystal and solid phases were still\npresent (Fig \\ref{FIG:Kcoexist}, inset).\n\nAll calculations reported here were carried out using the MOLDY\nmolecular dynamics package\\cite{moldy}.  The potentials were also\nconverted to LAMMPS format\\cite{lammps} and are available at the NIST\npotential database\\cite{NIST}.  These versions have adjustments at\nvery short range to fit to the Biersack-Ziegler\\cite{BZ} functions which are\npopular in radiation damage studies, but give identical results for\nthe problems considered here.\n\n\nFigure \\ref{FIG:Kcoexist} shows the changes in temperature for three\nconstant-energy simulations of a potassium supercell. \nConvergence times depend primarily on the atomic\nmass and on the system size and were typically on the order of hundreds of\npicoseconds.\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Kcoexist}\n\\caption{Temperature evolution of coexisting crystalline and liquid K\n  in the NPEp ensemble.

Thermal\nexpansion depends on third derivatives of the potentials, which are not\nfitted, nevertheless, both the values and trends across the group are\nin good agreement with experiment.  There is a weak temperature\ndependence, and in the absence of quantization of the phonons, calculated thermal expansions remain\nfinite to 0K.  The heating calculations also showed melting\ntransitions in all elements, and a martensitic transformation to a\nfaulted close-packed structure at low-T in Li and Na, also in accord\nwith experiment.  We observe that although this is an excellent test of\nphase stability, ``heat until it transforms'' is not a reliable way to determine transition\ntemperatures.\n\n\\subsection{Phase Coexistence Lines at pressure}\nIn order to generate coexistence lines on the PT phase diagram of the\nalkali metals the Clausius-Clapeyron equation was integrated using a\nfourth order predictor-corrector algorithm. The coexistence conditions\n($P$,$T$) were extrapolated over a range of several hundred degrees in\nintervals of 0.01 K. Shown in Figure \\ref{FIG:NaPTCurve} are the\nresults for sodium, others being similar.  \n\n\nAt high pressure, the alkali metals are known to exhibit a maximum in\nthe melting curve.  It is striking that none of the potentials\npresented here exhibits this feature: this tells us that physics\nbeyond that sampled in the ambient pressure state, where the fitting\nwas done, will be required.  Another high pressure phenomenon,\ntransformation to fcc, was observed in all the potentials, as a\nconsequence of the lower bulk modulus and higher packing density under\npressure.  In Na, and Li, there is a martensitic transition to a\ncomplex close-packed structure at low temperatures\\cite{LiNa9R,Sodiumfcc}\n\nIt is often assumed that the bcc-fcc transition and the melting point\nmaximum should be connected.  We find that the former can be deduced\nfrom extrapolation of low-T properties, while the latter cannot, which\nimplies that the physical mechanisms are likely to be different.\n\n\\subsection{Phonons}\nPhonon spectra can be calculated by lattice dynamics using the\nanalytic second derivatives of the potential.  For bcc, the symmetry\nconstraints and fit to elastic constants mean that agreement with\nexperiment is exact for the slope at the $\\Gamma$ point, so the\ngeneral similarity with neutron data is unsurprising and trends across\nthe group can be readily seen.  It is notable that Li and Na, which\nare unstable with respect to fcc at low temperature, have stable bcc\nphonon spectra, unlike other elements such as Ti and Zr, which are\ncalculated to have negative bcc shear moduli at 0K\\cite{Tegner,may1999,mendelev2007development}, and\ntransform to bcc at high temperatures due to soft T1N modes. Figures\n\\ref{FIG:Phonons} and \\ref{FIG:PhononsCs} show phonon spectra for Li\nand Cs, other elements being similar (Supplemental Figure 3).  The\nstable phases have real phonons throughout, but notably, fcc Cs is\nmechanically unstable with imaginary phonon modes along $\\Gamma-L$.\nAt higher pressures when Cs becomes thermodynamically stable, all\nphonons are stable.\n\nIt is also noticeable that the phonon frequencies are higher in fcc than in bcc.  This has the effect of stabilising the bcc phase\nat higher temperatures.  It is notable that\nthis feature is present in all cases, despite the properties of fcc elements being\nexcluded from the fitting process.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{Li2}\n\\caption{Phonon spectra calculated using lattice dynamics in\n  lithium in bcc (left, fitted) and fcc (right).\n\\label{FIG:Phonons}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{Cs2}\n\\caption{Phonon spectra calculated using lattice dynamics in Cs bcc\n  (left, as fitted) and fcc (unstable phase).\n\\label{FIG:PhononsCs}}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[H]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{expansiondata}\n\\caption{Volume against temperature for steady heating in NPT\n  molecular dynamics.

Although the potentials are fitted\nonly to crystal properties, they give a good description of the\nmelting point with the notable exception of lithium.  The very good\nagreement elsewhere suggests that for lithium our model is missing\nsome physics.  A reasonable candidate is the nuclear quantum effects,\nwhich are especially important for low mass effects.  The classical\nmolecular dynamics does not include the zero-point energy of lithium,\nwhich dominates the thermal energy below the Debye Temperature.  We\ncan expect that the zero point energy of the solid will be greater\nthan that of the liquid, such that the observed melting point will be \nlower than predicted by the classical coexistence simulations.\n\nThe potentials are fitted to fcc and bcc energy at 0K, and to\nproperties of bcc at ambient conditions, Consequently, the transition\ninto a higher temperature bcc state in Li and Rb is a successful\nprediction.  It is due to the lower phonon frequencies in bcc: the\nonly contributory factor which was fitted is the bcc elasticity\ntensor.  Heuristically, the fcc stability can be attributed to the\nappearance of a secondary minimum in the effective potential, which is\nmore pronounced in the lower Z-elements.  This minimum is not an input to the theory, it emerges from\nthe fitting process, implying that its existence manifests in some\nfeature of the fitted bcc elasticity.\n \nOverall, the work shows that a number of trends can be deduced from\nminimal fitted data.  Essentially, the input is that energies and\nelastic moduli are lower for higher-Z elements, while lattice\nparameters are larger.  From this we deduce that the thermal expansion\nand volume change on melting increases down the group, while the\nmelting point is reduced.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Acknowledgements}\nWe thank The University of Edinburgh for the CPU time allocation, EPSRC for support under EP/F010680/1.

These properties are\nindependent of the final parameter $a_6$, which controls the short\nranged repulsion inside the perfect crystal nearest neighbour\ndistance.  This was set to a constant value across all potentials,\nscaled by the cubed lattice parameter.  The $r_k$ parameters were set\nto be the same for all elements, as a fraction of lattice parameter (see Table 1).\n\nThe square root dependence appears to make the fitting nonlinear,\nhowever this nonlinearity can be transferred from the fitting to the\ndata being fitted. Specifically, the many-body term's parameters\n$A_k$ can be fully determined by linear fit to two quantities which\nare explicitly zero for any pair potential, i.e.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item\nthe difference between vacancy formation energy and cohesive energy $(E_{coh}-E_{vac})$\n\\item the Cauchy Pressure  $C_{12}-C_{44}$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe pair-potential parameters $a_i$ can then be determined by a linear\nfit to the difference between the required property and the\ncontribution from the many-body term.  The lattice parameter is fitted\nby setting the derivative of the energy to zero at the required value.\nThe fitting problem is then reduced to a simple 7x7 matrix problem.\n\nWe also attempted the fit using a genetic\nalgorithm\\cite{dieterich2010ogolem}, which converged immediately for\nthe linearly transformed problem, but failed to find the known\nsolution within required several weeks of CPU time when fitting the\nseven pieces of data directly.  The algorithm got ``stuck'' in many\nlocal minima, all of which are eliminated by transforming the fitting problem\nto linear algebra. \n\n\n For meaningful comparison, it is useful that the linear fit for all\n potentials gives a broadly similar solution: parameters are given in\n Table \\ref{TAB:Parametera}.  The best way to visualise these\n potentials is the ``effective pair potential'', which incorporates both\n attractive and repulsive parts, approximating $\\rho$ by its\n equilibrium value at the minimum bcc energy $\\rho_0$.\n\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nV_{eff}(r) =  V(r) + \\phi(r)/\\rho_0 \n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"V_{eff}(r)=V(r)+\\phi(r)/\\rho_{0}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>\u03c1</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
