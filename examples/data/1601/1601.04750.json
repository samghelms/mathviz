For M101 X-1, \\citet{Liu13} \nconfirmed that the system contains a Wolf-Rayet star and revealed that\nthe orbital period is 8.2 days. Based on this orbital period, they\nproposed that the black hole probably has a mass around\n$20-30 M_{\\sun}$. This is the first time to measure the black hole mass\nin a ULS by dynamic method. For another ULS, M81 ULS-1, \\citet{Liu15}\nfound blueshifted, broad H$\\alpha$ emission lines,\nwhich indicate that there exists a relativistic baryonic jet.\nMoreover, the blueshifted value reveals the inclination angle\n$\\theta < 60^{\\circ}$. Consequently,\nsince a white dwarf system is unable to launch such a relativistic jet,\nthe model based on a white dwarf can be ruled out.\n\nTwo well-known models for ULSs are related to intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) and stellar-mass black holes, respectively.\nThe model based on a standard thin disk \\citep{SS73} around an IMBH can\nexplain both high bolometric luminosity $L_{\\rm bol}$\nand low inner disk temperature $T_{\\rm in}$ due to the relation\n$T_{\\rm in} \\propto M_{\\rm BH}^{-1/4}$. However, compared with\nthe well-known behaviors of Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs),\nsuch a model may confront two difficulties.\nThe first one is related to the relative luminosity.\nUsually, the disk-dominated thermal state of a BHXB occurs\nfor $0.02L_{\\rm Edd} \\la L_{\\rm bol} \\la 0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$\n\\citep{Maccarone03,McClintock06}, where $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is\nthe Eddington luminosity. Such a range corresponds to\n$0.02 \\la \\dot m \\la 0.3$, where $\\dot m \\equiv \\dot M/\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$ \nis the dimensionless mass accretion rate, and $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$ is the\nEddington accretion rate defined as $L_{\\rm Edd}/(\\eta c^2)$.\nIn the present work we choose $\\eta = 1/16$ corresponding to\nthe well-known Paczy{\\'n}sky-Wiita potential \\citep{PW80}.\nFor the IMBH model, however, the relative luminosity $L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm Edd}$\nis generally far below the lower limit 0.02.\nThe second difficulty is related to the relativistic jet.\nThe existence of jet in M81 ULS-1 indicates that the jet may be a common\nphenomenon in ULSs. In Galactic BHXBs, there exist two\ntypes of jets, i.e., the steady jet in the low/hard state, and the episodic\njet during the transition between low/hard state and high/soft state\n\\citep{Fender04}.\nHowever, a standard thin disk around an IMBH should correspond to a purely\nsoft state, which disagrees with the conditions for the above two types of jets.\nThus, the IMBH model can be ruled out.\n\nThe other model, which is based on a stellar-mass black hole,\nmay also confront difficulties. First, for such a black hole, the accretion rate\nought to be around or super Eddington due to the high luminosity.\nIn our Galaxy, however, such a supersoft spectrum has never been found among\nthe around twenty identified BHXBs, some of which are likely to achieve or above\nEddington luminosity such as GRS~1915+105. Second, many ultraluminous\nX-ray sources (ULXs)\nhave been found in nearby galaxies, most of which are believed to be\nstellar-mass black holes with super-Eddington accretion\n\\citep[for a review, see][]{Feng11}. If ULSs are\nin the same scenario, then a question will arise: how can the super-Eddington\naccretion around stellar-mass black hole show the apparently different\nradiation characteristics?\n\nIn this $Letter$, we will propose a new model to understand ULSs, and try\nto unify ULSs and ULXs in the same frame. The remainder of this $Letter$\nis organized as follows. The thick accretion disk model is proposed\nin Section~2. Application of such a model to ULSs is presented in Section~3.\nConclusions and discussion are made in Section~4.\n\n\\section{Thick disk model}\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, ULSs are likely to be powered by\nsuper-Eddington accretion around stellar-mass black holes.\nThe classic model for super-Eddington accretion is the slim disk\n\\citep{Abram88}. The half-thickness $H$ of slim disks approaches the radius\n$R$, which are geometrically much thicker than the standard thin disks.\nRecent simulations have made great progress on the\nsuper-Eddington accretion process, including the identification of\nan important new energy transport mechanism in addition to the diffusion,\ni.e., the vertical advection of radiation \\citep{Jiang14,Sadow15b},\nthe radiation-powered baryonic jet \\citep{Sadow15a},\nthe strongly anisotropic feature of radiation \\citep{Sadow15b,Narayan15},\nand the presence of strong wind\n\\citep{Ohsuga11,Yang14,Sadow15a,Sadow15b,Moller15}.\nIn addition, such simulations showed that the disk is geometrically\nthick, i.e., the opening angle between the photosphere and the\nequatorial plane is quite large.\nFor example, \\citet{Narayan15} made global simulations for the case\n$\\dot m =11$ and showed a geometrically thick accretion disk, where the\npolar angle of the photosphere is around $25^{\\circ}$.\nAs a consequence, the inner disk will be invisible to\nan observer with an inclination angle $\\theta \\ga 25^{\\circ}$.\nOn the other hand, some analytic works also pointed out that the super-Eddington\naccretion disk, which is optically thick and probably advection dominated,\nis likely to be geometrically thick rather than slim if the gravitational force\nof the central black hole is well treated \\citep{Gu07,Gu09,Gu12}.\n\nIn the present work, we propose a geometrically thick,\nsuper-Eddington accretion model for ULSs, where the hot inner disk can\nbe shaded and the hard photons from this part cannot be observed\nif the inclination angle is not small.\nThe high bolometric luminosity and the low thermal temperature of ULSs\nsuggest a large photosphere radius,\n$R_{\\rm bb} \\ga 100 R_{\\rm g}$, where $R_{\\rm g} \\equiv 2GM_{\\rm BH}/c^2$\nis the Swarzschild radius.\nThus, the mass accretion rate ought to be extremely high such that\nthe flow can have a geometrically thick inner disk extended to\n$\\ga 100 R_{\\rm g}$.\nIn this scenario, there are two necessary conditions for ULSs, i.e.,\nhigh mass accretion rates and not small inclination angles.\nWe would stress that a basic assumption in our model is that\nan optically thick wind does not exist, which is unnecessary to\nexplain the observational properties of ULSs.\nA cartoon picture of such a model, which includes ULSs and ULXs,\nis shown in Figure~1. It is seen from this figure that the accretion disk\ncan be separated into two parts by a typical transition radius $R_{\\rm tr}$,\ni.e., an inner thick disk ($R \\la R_{\\rm tr}$) and an outer thin disk\n($R \\ga R_{\\rm tr}$).\nIn the classic theory for super-Eddington accretion, there exists a\ntransition radius which connects an inner slim disk and an outer\nthin disk \\citep[e.g.,][]{Abram88,Watarai00}.\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, for the super-Eddington accretion case,\nthe inner disk is more likely to be geometrically thick rather than slim.\nThat is why we propose a thick inner disk here.\nIn addition, the system may have a baryonic jet as revealed by \\citet{Liu15}.\nSuch a baryonic jet was also found in simulations with a relativistic speed\n$\\sim 0.3c$ \\citep{Sadow15a}.\nSince the jet can extend to a large distance, it may be observed\neven for large inclination angles. For the individual source\nM81 ULS-1, as mentioned in the first section, the blueshifted\nH$\\alpha$ emission lines indicate that the inclination angle\nought to be $\\theta < 60^{\\circ}$.\n\nOn the contrary, for a small inclination angle, an observer\nis able to see the hard photons from the inner disk. Moreover,\naccording to the simulation results \\citep[e.g., Figure~17 of][]{Narayan15},\nthe isotropic equivalent luminosity can be far beyond the Eddington one\n($\\sim 10L_{\\rm Edd}$ for $\\theta < 25^{\\circ}$,\nas shown by the filled red circles in their Figure~17).\nThus, a super-Eddington accreting stellar-mass black hole may appear as a normal\nULX to the observer with small inclination angles, as illustrated by Figure~1.\n\nIt is known that the spin of stellar-mass black hole can be measured\nthrough the X-ray continuum-fitting method \\citep{Zhang97}, which is\nbased on the standard thin disk theory.\nHowever, \\citet{McClintock06} found that the spin parameter $a_{*}$ of\nGRS~1915+105 decreases for high luminosity $L \\ga 0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$.\nObviously, the value of $a_{*}$ cannot have significant change in a relatively\nshort timescale. The reason is that the inner radius $R_{\\rm in}$\nmoves outward for $L \\ga 0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$, and therefore it is larger than\nthe radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $R_{\\rm ISCO}$.\nA possible physical explanation is that the disk will inflate\nfor $L \\ga 0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$\nand therefore the innermost region may be shaded \\citep{McClintock06}.\nWe would stress that such outward moving $R_{\\rm in}$ above $0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$ is\nnot a unique phenomenon for GRS~1915+105,\nwhich is verified as a near extreme Kerr black hole.\nFor another BHXB LMC~X-3 with low spin \\citep{Steiner14}, it was also found\nthat $R_{\\rm in}$ moves outward for $L \\ga 0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$ \\citep{Steiner10}.\nEven with a new spectral model ``slimbb\", which is based on theoretical\nworks on slim disks \\citep[e.g.,][]{Sadow11} and the energy advection\nis taken into account, $R_{\\rm in}$ still moves outward\nbeyond $0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$ \\citep{Straub11}.\nIn our opinion, the theoretical work \\citep{Sadow11} has achieved great\nprogress on the slim disk model, but may not be so accurate\ndue to the approximate vertical component of the gravitational force.\nAs discussed in \\citet{Gu12}, if the gravitational force is well treated\n(such as using the spherical coordinates), the inner disk will be much thicker,\nwhich may provide a clue to solve the inconsistent $a_{*}$ problem.\nMoreover, the outward moving $R_{\\rm in}$ was also found in neutron star\nX-ray binaries \\citep[e.g., XTE J1701-462,][]{Weng11}\nand ULXs \\citep[e.g., NGC 1313 X-2,][]{Weng14}.\nThus, we can regard $0.3L_{\\rm Edd}$ as a general upper limit luminosity for\nthe standard thin disk, beyond which such a model may be invalid. \n\nPrevious theoretical works \\citep[e.g.,][]{Watarai00,Kato08} showed that\nthe typical transition radius $R_{\\rm tr}$ is proportional to $\\dot m$,\nwe therefore assume the following equation:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nR_{\\rm tr} = \\lambda \\dot m R_{\\rm g} \\ ,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"R_{\\rm tr}=\\lambda\\dot{m}R_{\\rm g}\\ ,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>tr</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>m</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mi></msub></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04750.tex", "nexttext": "\nIt is interesting that the above equation implies that $L_{\\rm disk}^{\\rm thin}$\nis independent of $\\dot m$.\n\nAs shown by Figure~1, apart from the outer thin disk, the radiation from\nthe outer photosphere of the thick disk also has contribution to the total\nluminosity for a large inclination angle.\nSince the radiative force should be less than gravitational force\nat the photosphere, we may roughly assume that the former balances half of\nthe latter, i.e., $L_{\\rm disk}^{\\rm thick} \\sim 0.5 L_{\\rm Edd}$.\nBoth $L_{\\rm disk}^{\\rm thin}$ and $L_{\\rm disk}^{\\rm thick}$ are the thermal\nradiation, so we may simply calculate the total bolometric luminosity as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13384, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a dimensionless parameter.

For the other cases with super-Eddington\naccretion, the sources are likely to appear as normal ULXs.\nOur model can naturally explain the observational relation\n$R_{\\rm bb} \\propto T_{\\rm bb}^{-2}$ for ULSs.\nIn addition, we suggest that the black hole mass in ULSs can be estimated\nsimply from the total bolometric luminosity.\nBy comparing our model with the optically thick outflow model,\nwe find that less mass accretion rate is required in our model.\n\nWe would point out that there exists uncertainty for the value of $\\lambda$\nin Equation~(1). In the present work we adopt $\\lambda = 10$ according to\nprevious works on black hole spin measurement. From the theoretical point\nof view, \\citet{Watarai00} implies $\\lambda \\sim 2.4$ due to\ntheir result $R_{\\rm tr} \\approx R_{\\rm in}$ for $\\dot m = 1.25$ (note that\nthere exists different definition of $\\dot m$, thus their $\\dot m =20$\nis equivalent to our $\\dot m =1.25$). Since their analyses are based on a Taylor\nExpansion of the vertical component of the gravitational force, which is\nprobably magnified particularly for geometrically not thin disks\n\\citep{Gu07,Gu12}, the geometrically thickness may be underestimated and therefore\nthe real value of $R_{\\rm tr}$ may be larger. Actually, \\citet{Gu12}\ninvestigated this issue in spherical coordinates in order to avoid the\napproximation of gravity, and found that the disk can be geometrically thick\nat $10R_{\\rm g}$ for $\\dot m = 0.6$, which corresponds to $\\lambda \\approx 17$\nfrom Equation~(1).\nConsidering the Newtonian potential was adopted in \\citet{Gu12} and therefore\nthe viscous heating rate has been enlarged, $\\lambda$ should be less than 17.\nWith regard to the theoretical range $2.4 < \\lambda < 17$,\nit may be a reasonable assumption for $\\lambda = 10$.\nNevertheless, variation of $\\lambda$ by a small factor\nwill have only slight quantitative influence on the present results.\n\nOur model is based on the stellar-mass black hole system. For ULXs,\nhowever, we should mention the other two possibilities.\nOne possibility is neutron star X-ray binaries such as M82 X-2\n\\citep{Bachetti14}. The other one may be IMBH systems,\nparticularly for those sources with extremely high luminosity\n$L \\ga 10^{41}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, such as ESO 243-49 HLX-1 \\citep{Farrell09}.\n\nAs discussed in Section~2, the relation $L_{\\rm bol} \\approx 1.7 L_{\\rm Edd}$\nmay be used to estimate the black hole mass in ULSs.\nAlthough the inclination angle may have influence on the apparent luminosity,\nthe variation should not be essential due to the limit range of the angle.\nMoreover, such a relation indicates a saturated bolometric luminosity\nfor ULSs, or even more general, for super-Eddington accretion in different\nscale. In this scenario, for super-massive black holes in active galactic nuclei,\nif mass supply is sufficient, a similar supersoft state may be found.\nIf this is the case, such system may be regarded as another type\nof ``Standard Candle\" and will have potential application to\nthe study of cosmology.\n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Shan-Shan Weng for beneficial discussions,\nand the referee for constructive comments that improved the $Letter$.\nThis work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China\n(973 Program) under grants 2014CB845800 and 2014CB845705,\nthe National Natural Science Foundation of China under grants 11573023,\n11333004, 11373031, 11133005, 11573051, 11425313 and 11222328,\nthe CAS/SAFEA International Partnership Program for Creative Research Teams,\nand the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\nunder grant 20720140532.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem[Abramowicz et al.(1988)]{Abram88}\nAbramowicz, M.
