These edge modes \nhave been characterised in terms of transport and spectroscopic measurements, \nbut a thermodynamic description has been lacking. The challenge arises because \nin conventional thermodynamics the potentials are required to scale linearly with extensive variables like volume, which does not allow for a general treatment of \nboundary effects. In this paper, we overcome this challenge with Hill thermodynamics. In this extension of \nthe thermodynamic formalism, the grand potential is split into an extensive, conventional contribution, and the subdivision potential, \nwhich is the central construct of Hill's theory. For topologically non-trivial \nelectronic matter, the subdivision potential captures measurable contributions \nto the density of states and the heat capacity: it is the thermodynamic manifestation of the topological edge structure.\nFurthermore, the subdivision potential reveals phase transitions of the\nedge even when they are not manifested in the bulk, thus opening a variety of \nnew possibilities for investigating, manipulating, and characterizing \ntopological quantum matter solely in terms of equilibrium boundary physics.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nTopological insulators (TI's) are phases of electronic matter protected by \ntime-reversal symmetry \\cite{Kane2005QSHE,Kane2005Z2,Zhang2010,Hasan2010,Zhang2011}.\nHere, the topological part pertains to the presence of time-reversal conjugate\npairs of boundary states that are robust, that is, stable against perturbations \nthat do not break the protecting symmetry. In TI's, the transition between \na topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase is usually described in terms \nof band inversion, where the gap between two energy bands closes and creates \nan avoided crossing hosting the protected boundary states. This phenomenon is \nseen in HgTe quantum wells, for example, which undergo a topological phase\ntransition as a function of quantum well thickness \\cite{Bernevig2006}. \nThese edge modes have been detected through transport measurements \\cite{Konig2007}.\nIn the three dimensional case, the boundary modes are also conveniently described spectroscopically\nusing ARPES \\cite{Brune2011}. However, a thermodynamic description of topological boundary states is missing.\n\nA problem one encounters is that band topology is determined for infinite, translationally invariant systems\nin terms of Bloch Hamiltonians \\cite{Kitaev2009,Ryu2010}, whereas the \nedge states of the system are only found in finite systems with boundaries. \nThe bulk-boundary correspondence describes this connection between band \ntopology and edge states. If one tries to apply the thermodynamic formalism \nto topological phases of matter, one immediately discovers that there is \nno thermodynamic bulk-boundary correspondence. The thermodynamic potentials \nonly depend on the energy levels of the Hamiltonian and the density of states, \nwhile the topology of the bands depends on the eigenstates: two models can have \nthe same spectrum in the bulk, but different topological characteristics. \nSince in conventional thermodynamics the energy is additive with respect to \nthe extensive variables like entropy $S$, volume $V$, and particle number $N$,\nthe thermodynamic contribution of the edge states is lost in the \nconventional thermodynamic limit. \n\nIn this work, we show that the solution to this conundrum lies in Hill's refinement of conventional \nthermodynamics \\cite{Hill}. As computed from statistical mechanics, \nthe thermodynamic potentials (entropy or any of the various free energies) \ndo not typically scale linearly with the extensive variables of the system due to finite size and boundary effects.\nIn order to account for this feature within the thermodynamic framework, \nHill collects the deviations from linear scaling in a new state function, \nthe subdivision potential. To show how this works, we first give the necessary details from Hill's thermodynamics in Sec.~\\ref{HT}.\nWe then discuss in Sec.~\\ref{BE} how boundary effects can be described in terms of Hill's thermodynamics. Finally, in Sec.~\\ref{App} we apply the developed\ntheory to the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for HgTe quantum wells, to show how this works in practice. Our main results are presented in Sec.~\\ref{Res}: We show that the thermodynamic density of states and the specific heat signatures of the topological edge states can be experimentally detected. Moreover, we find that the topological phase transition is accompanied by a thermodynamic phase transition on the boundary of the system that has no counterpart in conventional thermodynamics. Our conclusions are summarised in Sec.~\\ref{Con}.\n\n\n\\section{Hill Thermodynamics}\\label{HT}\nLet us consider a finite system of size \\(V\\), in contact with an \nenvironment at temperature \\(T\\) and electronic chemical potential $\\mu$.\nWe take the extensive variable \\(V\\) to be the number of sites in the \nlattice associated to a tight-binding model of a TI. Formally, \n\\(V\\) must be a fluctuating parameter, which can be achieved by considering a reservoir of ions capable of becoming attached \nto the lattice. Then, conjugate to $V$ there is a variable $\\nu$ \ncharacterizing the thermodynamic response of the band structure to an \nincrease in the number of lattice sites \\footnote{One can also consider the dependence of the thermodynamics on $V$ if it is not a fluctuating parameter, but then one would formally be comparing different thermodynamic systems, which is experimentally more feasable, but theoretically inelegant.}.\n\nFor a system with these independent state variables, one uses the grand potential \\(\\Phi\\). In Hill's thermodynamics, it still obeys the conventional relation  \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{Tidentity}\nd\\Phi=-SdT-\\nu dV-Nd\\mu,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"d\\Phi=-SdT-\\nu dV-Nd\\mu,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>T</mi></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bd</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bc</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03745.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith $k_B$ denoting the Boltzmann constant and $H$ the Hamiltonian \nof the TI.

In Fig.~\\ref{F1}(a) and Fig.~\\ref{F1}(c) (Fig.~\\ref{F1}(b) and Fig.~\\ref{F1}(d)), we plot the $T=0$ ($\\mu=0$) density of states (heat capacity at constant volume) for the bulk (B) ${D^B:=-\\partial^2\\phi/\\partial\\mu^2}$ (${C^B_v:=-T \\partial^2\\phi/\\partial T^2}$) , and for the boundary (b) ${D^b:=-\\partial^2\\phi_0/\\partial\\mu^2}$ (${C^b_v:=-T \\partial^2\\phi_0/\\partial T^2}$)  in blue and in red, respectively. In Fig.~\\ref{F1}(a) (Fig.~\\ref{F1}(b)), the system is in the trivial phase $M=1$, whereas in Fig.~\\ref{F1}(c) (Fig.~\\ref{F1}(d)), the system is the topological phase $M=-1$. \n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{F1.pdf}\\\\\n\\caption{\\label{F1}(a) In blue, $D^{B}(\\mu)/W$ is shown for $M=1$; it has been shifted up by $0.1$ for greater visibility.

However, due to the presence of edges, there is also a non-vanishing contribution $D^b$. To interpret this contribution, it is important to note that $\\phi_0$ contains not just the topological edge states, but also other finite size effects, as evidenced by the finite value of $\\phi_0$ even if $M>0$. Outside the gap, non-topological finite size effects are dominated by the discreteness of the spectrum, and $D^b$ is essentially just noise. The noise becomes reduced in magnitude for non-zero temperatures, which smooths \nout the discreteness of the spectrum, or by fitting Eq.~(\\ref{HillPotential}) to \na larger range of $W$ values. \n\nOn the other hand, the energy spectrum of the edge states is much less dependent on the width $W$, and not subject to noise. Inside the gap, $D^B=0$ and the scaling of the density of states with $W$ vanishes, making $D^b$ the only term for all system sizes. In this case, it can be interpreted as the density of topological edge states, since finite-size effects only show up in combination with bulk behaviour. Indeed, the Dirac states at the edge disperse with $E=A k+\\mathcal{O}(k^3)$ \\cite{Hasan2010}, yielding a DOS of $1/(A\\pi)$ at $\\mu=0$ according to the Gibbs approach; the line $1/\\pi$ (obtained by putting $A=1$) has been added in yellow in Fig.~\\ref{F1}(c). \n\nTo first order in \\(T\\) \\cite{Kittel}, the heat capacity behaves as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13580, "prevtext": "\n\\end{widetext}\nHere, $k_i$ denotes momentum in the $i$ direction, $\\sigma_i$ are $2\\times2$ \nPauli matrices, with $i = x,y,z$, and $A,B$ and $M$ are parameters depending \non the thickness of the quantum well.

There is another situation where the derivatives of $\\hat \\nu$ fail to converge, which is if a phase transition occurs at the boundary.

The scheme is based on the idea that for topologically non-trivial\nsystems, a non-conventional thermodynamic limit exists: even though \nthe system becomes infinitely large, the boundary is always present. The \nboundary is taken into account as in Eq.~(\\ref{HillPotential}), in terms of the subdivision potential at the heart of Hill thermodynamics. The subdivision potential captures thermodynamic signatures unique to \ntopological insulators, including a DOS in the bandgap observable in\ntransport measurements \\cite{Konig2007}, and a contribution to \nthe electronic heat capacity, linear for the BHZ model. Most notably, this\ncontribution might be relevant for identifying topological phases in \nultracold-atom systems, where transport experiments are challenging\nand the absence of phonons makes the measurement of fermionic\nheat capacity easier. \n\nAlthough the edge contributions to the density of states and the specific heat can be captured by an effective model that artificially separates the bulk and the boundary contributions, the same does not hold when describing generic topological phase transitions.\nIf a system undergoes a phase \ntransition within the same symmetry class, the bandgap necessarily closes \nand a bulk phase transition takes place. The appearance/disappearance of\ntopologically protected edge states gives rise to an accompanying boundary \nphase transition, which can only be classified by the subdivision potential, and does not need to be of the same order as the one in the bulk.\nFurthermore, one also observes phase transitions between different symmetry classes, which occur without a \nclosing of the bulk gap. In this case, the topological phase transition \noccurs solely at the boundary. The fact that $\\phi_0$ detects a phase \ntransition even if the bulk gap does not close shows that the subdivision\npotential describes the edge behaviour of the system. This makes it a quantity of prime interest for investigating topological phase transitions, and allows for a classification of their order within the well known Ehrenfest scheme. These results open a new set \nof possibilities for experimentally detecting topological order by delicate\nbut standard thermodynamic methods, and provide a deeper understanding of \nthe effect of edges in the abstruse field of topological insulators.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nThe authors would like to acknowledge A.

Here, we provide a detailed description of the way these deviations depend on the various parameters in the system. The deviation, as a function of $W$, depends on $\\mu$ and $T$, and also on the gap size. Throughout this appendix, as well as in the main text, $A=B=1.$ We will vary the parameters $\\mu$, $T$, and $M$, and study the relative error $(\\Phi_W-\\Phi)/\\Phi$, where $\\Phi_W$ is given by Eq.~(\\ref{GibbsEnsemble}) for sample width $W$, and $\\Phi$ is the corresponding value after fitting to Eq.~(\\ref{HillPotential}). The range of $W$ along which we fitted to obtain $\\Phi$ will be mentioned for each specific case.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{UntopError.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{E1} (a) The relative error between $\\Phi_W$ and $\\Phi$, for $\\mu=T=0$ and $M=-1$. We have fitted along the interval $40\\leq W\\leq 100.$ (b) Same as in (a) but the range of $W$ has been changed. (c) Same as in (a) but for $\\mu=-4/3$. (d) Same as in (b) but for $\\mu=-4/3$.}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{E1}, the relative error has been plotted for the trivial phase $M=1$, at $T=0$, for small values of $W$, although the fitting was done for $40\\leq W\\leq 100,$ where the linear behaviour in $W$ has set in. In this way, one observes the small $W$ deviations from Eq.~\\ref{HillPotential} without including them in the fit. The results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{E1}(a) and (b) for $\\mu=0$, i.e. in the gap. Similarly, the results are shown in Fig.~\\ref{E1}(c) and (d) for $\\mu=-4/3$, i.e. in one of the bulk energy bands. We see that for very small system width, there is a large deviation from the linear relation in Eq.~(\\ref{HillPotential}), but the error quickly decreases. For $\\mu$ in the gap, the error quickly becomes negligible, while for $\\mu$ in one of the energy bands, the error is much larger , but also shows a clear structure (notice the unequal scales $10^{-16}$ in Fig.~\\ref{E1}(b) and $10^{-7}$ in Fig.~\\ref{E1}(d)). A likely cause of this error is the discreteness of the spectrum, which causes $\\Phi_W$ to deviate from $\\Phi$ as the system width is varied. This deviation occurs because varying the system width causes individual energies jump from above to below the chemical potential and vice versa. In the gap there are no states near the chemical potential, so this effect is absent, significantly reducing the error. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{LargeGap.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{E2} The relative error between $\\Phi_W$ and $\\Phi$, for $T=0$, $\\mu=-4/3$, and $M=-1$. We have fitted along the interval $500\\leq W\\leq 550.$}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{E2}, the relative error is plotted for $\\mu=-4/3$ at $T=0$ and $M=1$ for a fit along $500\\leq W\\leq 550.$ The relative error has decreased by two orders of magnitude compared to Fig.~\\ref{E1}(d), which means that the absolute error has decreased by one order of magnitude. This implies that the energy spectrum becomes less dependent on $W$ as $W$ increases. Furthermore, the behaviour of the relative error is qualitatively similar if one takes $M=-1$, which puts the system in the topological phase. This shows that the energy spectrum of the edge states is highly independent of $W$ even at small width, as can be expected from their strong localisation on the edge.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{SmallGap.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{E3} (a) The relative error between $\\Phi_W$ and $\\Phi$, for $T=0$, $\\mu=0$ and $M=0$. We have fitted along the interval $90\\leq W\\leq 100.$ It can be seen that the linear regime has not set in for this system size. (b) The same as in (a), but for $1000\\leq W\\leq 1010.$ The linear regime has set in, and the error is negligible.}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nWhen the gap becomes much smaller, the conclusions above still hold, but the width $W$ for which the error becomes negligible is larger. In Fig.~\\ref{E3}(a), the relative error has been plotted for $\\mu=T=0$ at $M=0$, for a fit along the values $90\\leq W\\leq 100.$ The errors show that the linear regime from Eq.~(\\ref{HillPotential}) has not set in yet. In contrast, Fig.~\\ref{E3}(b) shows a fit along $1000\\leq W\\leq 1010,$ for the same parameters, and here a linear scaling clearly holds.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Tdependence.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{E4} (a) The relative error between $\\Phi_W$ and $\\Phi$, for $k_B T=1/100$, $\\mu=-2$ and $M=1$. We have fitted along the interval $50\\leq W\\leq 100.$ The errors are of the same order as in Fig.~\\ref{E1}(d). (b) The same as in (a), but for $k_B T=1/10.$ The errors are significantly smaller, since the temperature effectively smooths out the energy spectrum.}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFinally, in Fig.~\\ref{E4}, the relative error is shown for $M=-1$, $\\mu=-2$ for a fitting interval of $50\\leq W\\leq 100$. In Fig.~\\ref{E4}(a), where $T=1/100$, the relative error is of the same order of magnitude as in Fig.~\\ref{E1}(d), indicating that the temperature is not yet high enough to suppress the fluctuations. In Fig.~\\ref{E4}(b), where $T=1/10$, the relative error has decreased by orders of magnitude, indicating that the smoothing of the Fermi-Dirac distribution at these temperatures suppresses the fluctuations in the energy spectrum.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{apsrev4-1}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{20}\n\\makeatletter\n\\providecommand \\@ifxundefined [1]{\n \\@ifx{#1\\undefined}\n}\n\\providecommand \\@ifnum [1]{\n \\ifnum #1\\expandafter \\@firstoftwo\n \\else \\expandafter \\@secondoftwo\n \\fi\n}\n\\providecommand \\@ifx [1]{\n \\ifx #1\\expandafter \\@firstoftwo\n \\else \\expandafter \\@secondoftwo\n \\fi\n}\n\\providecommand \\natexlab [1]{#1}\n\\providecommand \\enquote  [1]{``#1''}\n\\providecommand \\bibnamefont  [1]{#1}\n\\providecommand \\bibfnamefont [1]{#1}\n\\providecommand \\citenamefont [1]{#1}\n\\providecommand \\href@noop [0]{\\@secondoftwo}\n\\providecommand \\href [0]{\\begingroup \\@sanitize@url \\@href}\n\\providecommand \\@href[1]{\\@@startlink{#1}\\@@href}\n\\providecommand \\@@href[1]{\\endgroup#1\\@@endlink}\n\\providecommand \\@sanitize@url [0]{\\catcode `\\\\12\\catcode `\\$12\\catcode\n  `\\&12\\catcode `\\#12\\catcode `\\^12\\catcode `\\_12\\catcode `\\%12\\relax}\n\\providecommand \\@@startlink[1]{}\n\\providecommand \\@@endlink[0]{}\n\\providecommand \\url  [0]{\\begingroup\\@sanitize@url \\@url }\n\\providecommand \\@url [1]{\\endgroup\\@href {#1}{\\urlprefix }}\n\\providecommand \\urlprefix  [0]{URL }\n\\providecommand \\Eprint [0]{\\href }\n\\providecommand \\doibase [0]{http://dx.doi.org/}\n\\providecommand \\selectlanguage [0]{\\@gobble}\n\\providecommand \\bibinfo  [0]{\\@secondoftwo}\n\\providecommand \\bibfield  [0]{\\@secondoftwo}\n\\providecommand \\translation [1]{[#1]}\n\\providecommand \\BibitemOpen [0]{}\n\\providecommand \\bibitemStop [0]{}\n\\providecommand \\bibitemNoStop [0]{.\\EOS\\space}\n\\providecommand \\EOS [0]{\\spacefactor3000\\relax}\n\\providecommand \\BibitemShut  [1]{\\csname bibitem#1\\endcsname}\n\\let\\auto@bib@innerbib\\@empty\n\n\\bibitem [{\\citenamefont {Kane}\\ and\\ \\citenamefont\n  {Mele}(2005{\\natexlab{a}})}]{Kane2005QSHE}\n  \\BibitemOpen\n  \\bibfield  {author} {\\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {C.L.}~\\bibnamefont\n  {Kane}}\\ and\\ \\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {E.J.}~\\bibnamefont {Mele}},\\\n  }\\href@noop {} {\\bibfield  {journal} {\\bibinfo  {journal} {Phys.
