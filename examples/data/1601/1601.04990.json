EC is\nthe $e\\,p\\!\\to\\! \\nu\\,n$ weak-interaction process whereby an atomic electron interacts with a \nnucleus of charge $Z$ to produce a neutrino, leaving behind a nucleus of charge $Z-1$\nand a hole in the orbital of the daughter atom from which the electron was captured.\nThe optimal nuclide in this respect is $^{163}$Ho. The favoured experimental technique\nis ``calorimetric'' \\cite{ADR,ADRML,Nucciotti}.\nVarious experiments --ECHo \\cite{ECHo}, HOLMES \\cite{HOLMES} and \n NuMECS \\cite{NUMECS}-- are currently making progress in this direction.\n \n\n\n\nOnce upon a time it was argued that the calorimetric energy spectrum of $^{163}$Ho decay\n ought to be very well approximated by a simple theoretical expression: the sum\n over the Breit-Wigner-shaped contributions of the single holes left by electrons\n  weakly captured by the nucleus \\cite{ADRML}. In the\n extremely good approximation in which nuclear-size effects are neglected, \n the corresponding orbitals are the ones whose wave function at the origin is non-vanishing.\n In holmium EC decay to dysprosium the \n reaction's Q-value is smaller than the \n L (n=2) binding energies so that  \n  the potentially capturing orbitals (or resulting holes) are\n  H = M1, M2, N1, N2, O1, O2 and P1, after\n  which the 67th element (Ho) runs out of electrons.\n  \nRobertson has pointed out\nthat two-hole contributions should not be negligible \\cite{Robertson1,Robertson2}. \nIn an EC event, the wave functions of the spectator electrons in the mother and\ndaugther atoms are not identical, the small mismatch leading to an ``instantaneous''\ncreation of secondary holes, H'. An electron having been expelled from the\nH' orbital may have been ``shaken up'' to an unoccupied atomic level or\n``shaken off'' into the continuum.\n\nThe probabilities $P\\rm (H,H')$ for the production of two holes\nare much smaller than single-hole ones, $P\\rm (H)$. Yet, when the energy deficit\nof the two-hole state\n$E({\\rm H,H')}\\sim E({\\rm H)}+E({\\rm H')}$\nis not very close to that of a prominent --but narrow--\nsingle-hole peak, there is an observable feature in the\nspectrum, even if $P{\\rm (H,H')}\\ll P\\rm (H)$.\n\nRobertson argues that {\\it ``If the presence of the\ncurvature in the spectrum} [due to two-hole processes] \n{\\it near the endpoint were not known to an\nanalyst, fitting to the standard spectral shape would produce erroneous\nresults for Q and $m_\\nu$''}. The two-hole processes, if significant,\nwill be observed much before the analyst attempts to measure the cited parameters. Moreover,\ngiven the recently measured Q-value, \n$Q\\equiv M({\\rm ^{163}Ho})-M({\\rm ^{163}Dy})=2833\\,\\rm (30_{stat})\\,(15_{sys})$  eV  \\cite{Qval},\nthe dangerous possibility that $E({\\rm H,H')}\\sim Q$ for any given pair of holes is excluded.\n\nThe bad news is that the cited value of $Q$ is larger than the previously `recommended'' \nfigure, $Q=2.555\\pm 0.016$ keV \\cite{Audi}, which goes in the direction of making\na potential measurement of $m_\\nu$ more difficult. The good news, as we shall argue,\nis that the contribution of two-hole states close to the spectral endpoint may compensate\nfor the bad news, possibly in an overwhelming way.\n\nWe shall be specifically interested in calorimetric energies, $E_c$, in a domain hardly explored\nso far, extending from the M1 peak at  $E_c\\sim 2050$ eV to the endpoint at $E_c=Q-m_\\nu$.\nThough QED and the weak-interaction theory are well established to impressive levels of\nprecision, dealing with atoms containing up to 67 electrons is not entirely straightforward.\nThus, we shall need observational input to guide our course.\n\n\\section{Previous results}\n\n\\subsection{Data vs theory}\n\nSome of the preliminary data of ECHo \\cite{ECHo2} and NuMECS \\cite{NUMECS2} are \nshown in Figs.\\,(\\ref{fig:LG},\\ref{fig:Kunde}). There, they are compared with an elaborate\ntheory  of the calorimetric spectrum  \\cite{Faessler1,Faessler2},\n smeared with the experimental resolution \nand with the inclusion of one, two and three-hole\ncontributions. The agreement of theory and data is fairly good for the prominent M1, M2, N1 \nand N2 contributions. \n\nThere is in the ECHo data a significant peak at an\nenergy close to the expected position of a contribution from N1 capture accompanied\nby O1 shakeup (N1O1), much larger than the theoretical expectation of\n \\cite{Faessler1,Faessler2}. There is no evidence, at the predicted level, for \nthe contribution from N1 capture accompanied by N4/5 shakeup (N1N4/5) in either \nexperiment. An expected, sizeable M1N4/5 peak is also apparently absent in the NuMECS\ndata (it is tacitly assumed in these theoretical predictions \\cite{Faessler1,Faessler2} \nthat the computed probability for the production of a\nsecond hole corresponds entirely to electron shakeup).\nFinally, in both data sets, there is evidence for a\n ``shoulder'' above the theoretical expectations\nin the 480 eV $< E_c <$ 550 eV domain of calorimetric energy.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.50\\textwidth]{keVRegion.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Blue: calorimetric spectrum measured by ECHo \\cite{ECHo2}.\nMagenta: prediction of Faessler et al.\\,\\cite{Faessler2}.\nRed, dotted: added effect of the contributions N1O1\\{c,u\\}\n(arbitrarily multiplied by 2.5) and N1O1\\{c,o\\} \\cite{us}.\nThe notation \\{c,u(o)\\} indicates that one electron is captured,\none shaken up (off).\n}\n\\label{fig:LG}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{KundeNew.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Black:  calorimetric spectrum measured by NuMECS \\cite{NUMECS2}.\nRed: theoretical prediction of Faessler et al. \\cite{Faessler2}. \n}\n\\label{fig:Kunde}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn \\cite{us} we have interpreted the situation just described in terms of a simple theory\nof the production of ``second'' holes, described in the following chapter. The predictions,\nfor the region close to the N1, N2 single-hole peaks, are shown in Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:Us}).\nIn this and subsequent figures, the symbols \\{c,u\\} and \\{c,o\\} refer to one electron\nbeing captured (c), the other one being shaken up (u) or off (o). The curly brackets\nremind us that the electrons are indistinguishable and their wave functions \nanti-symmetrized.\n\nOnce again,  theory  \\cite{us}\n and data disagree. Our estimate of the height of the N1O1\\{c,u\\}\nshakeup peak is\na factor $\\sim\\! 2.5$ too low. It is possible to correct in similarly moderate\nways the other contributions\nsuch as to agree with the data.\nOne possibility, illustrated in Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:Us}), is to correct the\nN1O1\\{c,u\\} peak by the cited factor and\nto leave N1O1\\{c,o\\} \nshake-off shoulder --which snugly\ndescribes the observed one-- as predicted, while reducing the N1N4/5\nfeatures by a factor $\\sim 3$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.55\\textwidth]{TheoryAsItIsC.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The N-region.

Much less so is\nthe shape of a shakeoff feature which, computed in the customary sudden approximation, \ndepends on an overlap of bound and unbound wave functions.\n\nFinally, the predictions for the normalization\nof the various contributions, particularly the more elaborate ones \\cite{Faessler1,Faessler2},\nseem to be very untrustworthy. On the\nway to an analysis of the enpoint,  the size of the\nvarious spectral features will need to be adjusted to fit the data.\n\n\\section{A rough theoretical guidance}\n\\label{theory}\n\nIn this section  \nwe clone the simple theory of the production of one \\cite{ADRML}\nor more holes \\cite{us} in electron capture, adapting it to the region of calorimetric energies\nextending from the M1 and M2 holes to the spectral endpoint.\n\n\\subsection{The spectrum of single holes}\n\nIn its simplest approximation \\cite{ADRML} the spectrum of calorimetric energies, \n$E_c$, is a sum of Breit-Wigner (BW)\n peaks at the $E_c=E_{\\rm H}$ positions\\footnote{The daughter Dy* atom has a hole and an\n extra electron in the N7 ($4f_{7/2}$) level, of binding energy $\\sim 4.2$ eV, so that, more\n precisely, $E_c=E_{\\rm H}-E_{\\rm N7}$.

In comparisons with data the predictions for the peak positions\n will anyway be slightly adjusted to fit.}, \n with their natural hole widths, $\\Gamma_{\\rm H}$. \n The peak intensities are proportional to $\\varphi_{\\rm H}^2(0)$, the values in Ho of the\n squared wave functions at the origin \n of the electrons to be captured.

Recall here, and in what follows, that\n we have assumed that our ``experiment\" has a perfect resolution.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{KurieA.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{{\\bf Above}: The uppermost $\\sim 700$ eV of the spectrum, with an arbitrary\nvertical scale. {\\bf Below}: The corresponding Kurie plot (the square root of above-plotted\nspectral shape).\n}\n\\label{fig:KurieA}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe uppermost $\\sim 200$ (30) eV of the Kurie plot are shown in \nthe upper (lower) part of Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:KurieB}).

The ``problem\" is that\nthe precise shape and magnitude of  the HH'\\{c,o\\} double-hole contributions are not. \nEven if these contributions are measured to be significant as one approaches\nthe endpoint, we have argued, the use of one more parameter in the fits (the extra \ncoefficient in a quadratic function of energy) should solve this apparent problem.\n\nIt goes without saying that these theoretical conclusions would gain (or lose) \nweight if and when they are tested with adequate simulations of data in a\nrealistic observational environment. The advantages of a possibly increased\nstatistics in the endpoint region (compared with single-hole expectations) \nmay be a tempting reason to perform such an analysis.\n\n\\section{Pile-up}\n\nThe finite time required to record an EC event gives rise to the\ninescapable problem of pile-up: the additional contribution of the \nspectrum of two ``simultaneous\" events. If the ``singles\" spectrum (of single events)\nhas a sizable contribution of HH'\\{c,o\\} events towards its endpoint, the\nconcern with pile-up {\\it diminishes}.\n\nLet $d\\hat R/dE_c$ be the singles spectrum, with its integral in the\ninterval  $0<E_c<Q$ normalized to unity. \nThe pileup spectrum, also normalized to unity in the interval  $0<E_c<2\\,Q$, is:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 19843, "prevtext": "\n To first order in  $\\alpha$ the wave function of the\nN1 level in Dy* is then expressed as a linear combination of Ho eigenfunctions: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n|{\\rm Dy^*[N1]}\\rangle\\simeq |{\\rm Ho[N1]}\\rangle+\\sum_n B_n\\,|{\\rm Ho}[n]\\rangle\n\\qquad\\qquad\\nonumber\\\\\n+\\frac{1}{2\\,\\pi}\\int_0^\\infty dp_e \\; B_{\\rm off}(p_e)\\; |{\\rm Ho}[p_e]\\rangle,\\qquad\\qquad \n\\label{wave}\\\\\nB_n\\equiv {\\alpha \\over E_{_{\\rm N1}}-E_n}\\int d^3r\\,\n\\phi_n^* (r)\\phi_{_{\\rm N1}}(r)\\, b(r),\\qquad\\qquad \n\\label{B}\\\\\nB_{\\rm off}(p_e)\\equiv{\\alpha \\over E_{_{\\rm N1}}+T_e} \\int d^3r\\,\\phi^* (p_e,r)\\phi_{_{\\rm N1}}(r)\\, b(r)\\;\\quad\n\\label{BB}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $n$ in the wave functions $|{\\rm Ho[n]}\\rangle$ stands for the $l=0$ bound levels with $n \\neq 4$ and (positive) binding energy $E_n$, $\\phi (p_e,r)$ is the unbound wave function, defined as in \\cite{L&L}, of an $l=0$ electron with momentum $p_e$ and kinetic energy $T_e=p_e^2/(2\\,m_e)$.\n\n\nTo take into account Fermi statistics, one must --it goes without saying--\n also do the calculations encapsulated in \nEqs.\\,(\\ref{IP}-\\ref{BB}) with the exchange M1 $\\leftrightarrow$ N1, since the two-hole final state,\nat a given $T_e$, is the same independently of which electron is captured or ejected. \nThus, in the sudden approximation, the\nsquare of the (monopolar) matrix element\nfor an electron being shaken-off with energy $T_e$ results in:\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n{dM\\over dT_e}= {m_e\\over 4\\,\\pi^2\\,p_e}\\,|\\{1-\\Pi({\\rm M1,N1)}\\}\\,\\varphi_{\\rm M1}(0)\nB_{\\rm off}(p_e)|^2\n\\label{antiSym}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{dM\\over dT_{e}}={m_{e}\\over 4\\,\\pi^{2}\\,p_{e}}\\,|\\{1-\\Pi({\\rm M1,N1)}\\}\\,%&#10;\\varphi_{\\rm M1}(0)B_{\\rm off}(p_{e})|^{2}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><msub><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>4</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mi>\u03c0</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>M1</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>N1</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c6</mi><mi>M1</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>B</mi><mi>off</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04990.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{OldAndNewPileUp.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{``Singles\" \n\nand ``Pileup\" \n\nspectral shapes, with a $4\\times 10^{-5}$ pileup probability\nand an arbitrary (but common) vertical scale normalization.\n{\\bf Above}: Spectra with captures resulting only in single holes.\n{\\bf Below}: Spectra with the addition of events resulting in double holes.\n\nThe regions around $E_c=Q$ are significantly\ndifferent in the upper and lower plots.\n}\n\\label{fig:AllPileup}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor the sake of illustration, let the probability of pileup be $4\\times 10^{-5}$.\nIn the upper part of Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:AllPileup}) we show the corresponding\nsingles and pileup spectra for the case in which they are exclusively dominated\nby single-hole captures (the vertical scale is arbitrary, but the ratio of the\ntwo spectra is not, it corresponds to the assumed pileup probability).\nWith the same proviso\\footnote{A hawk-eyed reader may notice\nthat these spectra do not have the little wiggles visible in \nFig.\\,(\\ref{fig:FullMSpectrum}).

In the current exploratory phase \nof the experiments it would be tempting to subtract from the data the single-hole\nexpectation, to visualize directly the {\\it residuum}: the cited extra contributions. \nOne could, for instance,\nsubtract the blue curve in Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:FullMSpectrum}) from the black one, to\nextract the red one: the residual sum of double-hole contributions. We now address the\nquestion of the precision with which this  can be done. \n\nGiven the large statistics with which single-hole contributions will be measured at\nand around their peaks, there is no question that their individual parameters \n(position, height and width) will be exquisitely measured. But to obtain the residua\na BW shape in Eqs.\\,(\\ref{dRdEc},\\ref{BW}),\nextending up to very many widths above the peak, must be\nassumed. A Breit-Wigner is an approximation known to require, in certain cases,\npotentially large explicit corrections \\cite{PDG}.\n\nThe proof that in the calorimetric case at hand the simple standard BW shape\nwe have used is perfectly well suited is lengthy. We relegate it to  \nAppendix \\ref{AppTails}.\n\n\n\\section{The shortcomings of theory}\n\nThe precise treatment of a process in an atom with 67 electrons is obviously intricate. \nOne limitation, in the case of EC, is the use of the sudden approximation.\nWhile it is justified in the analysis of electrons captured from the inner orbitals, \nit is less so for captures from the $n\\geq 3$ levels of interest here. \n\nIn the sudden approximation (e.g.~in a $\\beta$-decay) and in estimating secondary-hole probabilities, \n the time required for the change of nuclear charge is assumed to be negligible relative to the typical atomic orbital times: the time it takes them to ``react'' to the new environment.\n In EC this assumption --used for decades without hardly a comment--\n  is extended to the comparison\n of the time required to propagate\n  the information that the captured electron has disappeared, relative to\n the rest of the characteristic atomic times: the former must be negligible.\n\nThe opposite to the sudden extreme is the adiabatic case, in which the electronic orbitals have time aplenty to slowly evolve from the parent-atom eigenstates to\nthe daughter-atom ones. In the extreme adiabatic limit the probability of\nmaking ``second holes'' would vanish.\n\n\\subsection{The nuclear capture time}\n\nThe characteristic time, $\\tau_{N}$, for the EC\n process $p+e\\to n+\\nu$ underlying the nuclear transition\nis the inverse of the energy transfer $q_0$. For a process with ${\\rm Q}\\ll m_e$, such as the\none under discussion, $q_0\\simeq m_e$ and $\\tau_{N}\\simeq 1/q_0$ is orders of magnitude\nsmaller than any characteristic atomic time. In the nuclear sense, EC is instantaneous.\n\n\\subsection{Our two-electron approach}\n\nIn the simple approach that we have discussed in \\S \\ref{theory}, two electrons (the captured one\nand the one that is potentially exiting its orbital) play a singular role. The rest of the\nelectrons are only there to imply some effective values of $Z$ or to forbid some transitions.\nBut once more, a non-relativistic\nCoulombic approximation\\footnote{We used the limit $v/c\\to 0$ everywhere but\nin allowing for the particularly large effect of EC from the $l=1,\\,j=1/2$\norbitals.}\nprovides guidance, which\nin the case of the adequacy of the sudden approximation turns out to be quite relevant.\n\nThe relativistic retardation of signals implies that the sudden nuclear\ntransition $Z\\!\\to\\! Z-1$ cannot be instantaneously felt by an electron\nin an orbital of mean radius $r$. It takes a time of order $r$ for the orbital\nto be ``informed''. Similarly, the absence of the electron that was captured is felt by\nanother atomic electron after a time of the order of the larger of the two mean\norbital radii.\n\nRecall that the mean radius and binding energy of a Coulombic eigenfunction, in the usual \nnotation, are:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr[n,l]&=&{[3\\,n^2-l(l+1)]/({2 \\,m_e}\\,Z\\,\\alpha)}\\label{radius}\\\\\nE[n]&=&{m_e\\,(Z\\,\\alpha)^2/ (2\\,n^2)}\\label{energy}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe quantum-mechanical characteristic time for a bound state to ``react'' to a perturbation is \nthe inverse of its binding energy. Thus,\ndeviations from the sudden approximation in a transition amplitude are, up to a factor of ${\\cal O}(1)$, governed by a figure of merit $\\delta$:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 34338, "prevtext": "\nfor the distribution function of Eq.\\,(\\ref{overlapfree}).\n\nA crucial point in estimating wave-function overlaps is to choose them with the correct\nspatial scale. To provide an estimate of the shape of $dM/dT_e$ we shall use \nnon-relativistic Coulomb \nwave functions\\footnote{These would give very poor estimates of the wave functions \nat the origin, for which we use instead \nthe values given by the accurate calculations in \\cite{Robertson2, Faessler1, Faessler2}.}  of Ho\nwith effective values of $Z$ chosen to reproduce the relevant\norbits' mean radii, as calculated with more precise Hartree-Fock methods \\cite{McLean}.\nLet $r_B\\equiv 1/(\\alpha \\, m_e)$ denote the Bohr radius. \nFor $\\langle r({\\rm M1})\\rangle=0.246\\,r_B$ and\n$\\langle r({\\rm N1})\\rangle=0.555\\,r_B$ \nthe effective charges are $Z_{\\rm eff}({\\rm M1})=54.9$, to be used in Eq.\\,(\\ref{IP}) and\n$Z_{\\rm eff}({\\rm N1})=43.2$ , to be used for the bound and free wave functions\nin Eq.\\,(\\ref{BB}).\n\n\\section{The M-hole region and beyond}\n\nIn what follows we present results for the spectral domain extending from the M2 and M1\nsingle-hole contributions to the spectral endpoint, assumed to be at Q = 2833 keV. First\nwe take at face value the results of the calculations described in the previous section.\nSince the results are very optimistic --in the sense of facilitating a potential constraint on\n$m_\\nu$-- we shall later discuss the possibility that our predictions are gross overestimates.\n\nIn Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:FullMSpectrum}) we show the separate contributions of the\none-hole spectrum, the dominant contribution to the two-hole spectrum \nin this energy domain (M2H plus M1H), and the one-plus-two-hole \nresult\\footnote {We did not include other two-hole contributions (like N1M4 and N1M5) \ngiving small structures below the M2 peak.}.\nThis is a {\\it theorist's spectrum}, \nwith an arbitrarily normalized vertical scale,\n$m_\\nu=0$ and an experimental width, $\\Gamma_{\\rm exp}$,\nwhose square is negligible relative to that of any of the hole's natural widths.\nAll the subsequent figures will also, in the same sense, depict \narbitrarily normalized spectral shapes,\noccasionally with $m_\\nu\\neq 0$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{FullMSpectrum.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The ``theorist's\" calorimetric spectrum in the M region\n(the normalization of the vertical scale is arbitrary).

Including the contribution to the two-hole spectrum the same quantity comes out to be 30.6 kg y even if Q = 2.833 keV. Gathering this amount of $^{163}$Ho is still a wee bit unrealistic. \n\nThe details contributing to the construction of Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:M12HHoles}) are given\nin Figs.\\,(\\ref{fig:M1HHoles},\\ref{fig:M2HHoles}), where, respectively, the various\nM1H and M2H double hole contributions are specified.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{M2HHoles.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{The M2H two-hole contributions in detail.

The triple-hole \ncontributions, contrariwise, are largest at $E_c$ values at which the shake-off contribution\nof double holes is relatively large.

The ``problem\" is that\nthe precise shape and magnitude of  the HH'\\{c,o\\} double-hole contributions are not. \nEven if these contributions are measured to be significant as one approaches\nthe endpoint, we have argued, the use of one more parameter in the fits (the extra \ncoefficient in a quadratic function of energy) should solve this apparent problem.\n\nIt goes without saying that these theoretical conclusions would gain (or lose) \nweight if and when they are tested with adequate simulations of data in a\nrealistic observational environment. The advantages of a possibly increased\nstatistics in the endpoint region (compared with single-hole expectations) \nmay be a tempting reason to perform such an analysis.\n\n\\section{Pile-up}\n\nThe finite time required to record an EC event gives rise to the\ninescapable problem of pile-up: the additional contribution of the \nspectrum of two ``simultaneous\" events.

But measurements of\nthe next-to-best electron-capturing isotope, \n$^{193}$Pt, could be of help in understanding the difficult theoretical\nissues associated with the\ntwo-hole contributions. The problem is simply one of QED, like in the case of holmium\nor the slightly harder problem of understanding  the human brain. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nThe current very preliminary data on the calorimetric spectrum of $^{163}$Ho decay,\n in the region of the N peaks,\nappear to be qualitatively described by the simplified theory we have discussed.\nA similarly preliminary conclusion is that the description of the observations \nbecomes quantitively satisfactory when the various theoretical single- and double-hole features \nare renormalized to fit the data. Once the data improve, we expect this conclusion to\nbecome more solid.\n\n\nOn the way to measure or limit the neutrino mass, the relevant energy domain is \nnot yet explored. It is the\none extending from the M2 and M1 single peaks towards the spectral endpoint,\nthe interval we have analized in detail. It is there that future data \nand the comparison of its features with theory will be of utmost interest.\n\nWe argued that,  relative to the ``old theory\" with only\nsingle-hole contributions,\ndouble-hole effects may enhance the spectral\nendpoint region by a factor of $\\sim \\! 40$. If this is correct, a given statistical goal\nmay be achieved $\\sim\\! 6$ times faster than previously foreseen.\nWe showed that the pileup problem would also be reduced by a similar factor.\n\nWe cannot indubitably trust the above optimistic conclusions. Thus, we have\nalso studied the possibility that double- and single-hole contributions be\nof similar magnitude close to the endpoint. This choice makes\nthe theoretical analysis of the data more challenging. \nBut we have argued that also in this\nvery pessimistic case the introduction of just one extra parameter --besides\nthe two in a linear function of energy, plus Q and $m_\\nu$-- should be enough\nto analyse the data along well-trodden paths.\n\nAn issue that remains to be investigated is the possible existence, in a given\ncalorimeter's substrate, of BEFS oscillations. These would be due \nto Ho-decay electrons undergoing reflections in the crystal lattice \\cite{BEFS}.\n\nThe possibility of a significant contribution of electron shake-ups,\nleading to double-hole spectral peaks, was originally presented as\nvery damning \\cite{Robertson1,Robertson2}. Somewhat ironically, the \nlikely existence of a significant contribution of electron shake-offs\nmay be a very welcome blessing.\n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\nWe are indebted to Loredana Gastaldo, Angelo Nucciotti and Michael Rabin for fruitful discussions.\nADR acknowledges partial support from the  European Union FP7  ITN INVISIBLES (Marie Curie Actions, PITN- GA-2011- 289442).\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section{Interferences}\n\\label{app:interferences}\n\nIn the single-hole spectrum of Eq.\\,(\\ref{dRdEc}) quantum interferences have been omitted.\nTo discuss how good an approximation this is, we concentrate on the potentially most significant\ninterference: the one between the M1 and N1 amplitudes. For them to interfere, the $j=\\rm M1,N1$\nholes must decay into the same (generally two-hole) final state $f$. Introduce the notation by\nwriting the corresponding amplitude\nand probability as:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nA_j^f &\\propto& \\phi_j(0) \\; \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_j / \\pi}}{ E-E_j + i\\;\\gamma_j}  \n\\sqrt{b(j \\to f)}\\;e^{{i\\psi_j^f}}\\;, \\label{int1} \\\\\n\\Gamma^f &\\propto& |\\sum_j A_j ^f|^2 = \n\\sum_j |A_j^f|^2\\;+\\; \\sum_{k\\neq j} A_k^f\\,(A_j^f)^*\\;,\n\\label{int2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\gamma_j\\equiv\\Gamma_j/2$ is the half-width, $b(j\\! \\to\\! f)$ is the branching fraction for this decay and $\\psi_j^f$ is the unknown phase. \nSumming over all possible $f$ in Eq.\\,(\\ref{int2}), the first (second) term is the single hole expression \n(the interference). The explicit expression for the latter is:\n \\begin{widetext}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 41667, "prevtext": "\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{OldAndNewPileUp.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{``Singles\" \n\nand ``Pileup\" \n\nspectral shapes, with a $4\\times 10^{-5}$ pileup probability\nand an arbitrary (but common) vertical scale normalization.\n{\\bf Above}: Spectra with captures resulting only in single holes.\n{\\bf Below}: Spectra with the addition of events resulting in double holes.\n\nThe regions around $E_c=Q$ are significantly\ndifferent in the upper and lower plots.\n}\n\\label{fig:AllPileup}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFor the sake of illustration, let the probability of pileup be $4\\times 10^{-5}$.\nIn the upper part of Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:AllPileup}) we show the corresponding\nsingles and pileup spectra for the case in which they are exclusively dominated\nby single-hole captures (the vertical scale is arbitrary, but the ratio of the\ntwo spectra is not, it corresponds to the assumed pileup probability).\nWith the same proviso\\footnote{A hawk-eyed reader may notice\nthat these spectra do not have the little wiggles visible in \nFig.\\,(\\ref{fig:FullMSpectrum}).

In the current exploratory phase \nof the experiments it would be tempting to subtract from the data the single-hole\nexpectation, to visualize directly the {\\it residuum}: the cited extra contributions. \nOne could, for instance,\nsubtract the blue curve in Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:FullMSpectrum}) from the black one, to\nextract the red one: the residual sum of double-hole contributions. We now address the\nquestion of the precision with which this  can be done. \n\nGiven the large statistics with which single-hole contributions will be measured at\nand around their peaks, there is no question that their individual parameters \n(position, height and width) will be exquisitely measured. But to obtain the residua\na BW shape in Eqs.\\,(\\ref{dRdEc},\\ref{BW}),\nextending up to very many widths above the peak, must be\nassumed. A Breit-Wigner is an approximation known to require, in certain cases,\npotentially large explicit corrections \\cite{PDG}.\n\nThe proof that in the calorimetric case at hand the simple standard BW shape\nwe have used is perfectly well suited is lengthy. We relegate it to  \nAppendix \\ref{AppTails}.\n\n\n\\section{The shortcomings of theory}\n\nThe precise treatment of a process in an atom with 67 electrons is obviously intricate. \nOne limitation, in the case of EC, is the use of the sudden approximation.\nWhile it is justified in the analysis of electrons captured from the inner orbitals, \nit is less so for captures from the $n\\geq 3$ levels of interest here. \n\nIn the sudden approximation (e.g.~in a $\\beta$-decay) and in estimating secondary-hole probabilities, \n the time required for the change of nuclear charge is assumed to be negligible relative to the typical atomic orbital times: the time it takes them to ``react'' to the new environment.\n In EC this assumption --used for decades without hardly a comment--\n  is extended to the comparison\n of the time required to propagate\n  the information that the captured electron has disappeared, relative to\n the rest of the characteristic atomic times: the former must be negligible.\n\nThe opposite to the sudden extreme is the adiabatic case, in which the electronic orbitals have time aplenty to slowly evolve from the parent-atom eigenstates to\nthe daughter-atom ones. In the extreme adiabatic limit the probability of\nmaking ``second holes'' would vanish.\n\n\\subsection{The nuclear capture time}\n\nThe characteristic time, $\\tau_{N}$, for the EC\n process $p+e\\to n+\\nu$ underlying the nuclear transition\nis the inverse of the energy transfer $q_0$. For a process with ${\\rm Q}\\ll m_e$, such as the\none under discussion, $q_0\\simeq m_e$ and $\\tau_{N}\\simeq 1/q_0$ is orders of magnitude\nsmaller than any characteristic atomic time. In the nuclear sense, EC is instantaneous.\n\n\\subsection{Our two-electron approach}\n\nIn the simple approach that we have discussed in \\S \\ref{theory}, two electrons (the captured one\nand the one that is potentially exiting its orbital) play a singular role. The rest of the\nelectrons are only there to imply some effective values of $Z$ or to forbid some transitions.\nBut once more, a non-relativistic\nCoulombic approximation\\footnote{We used the limit $v/c\\to 0$ everywhere but\nin allowing for the particularly large effect of EC from the $l=1,\\,j=1/2$\norbitals.}\nprovides guidance, which\nin the case of the adequacy of the sudden approximation turns out to be quite relevant.\n\nThe relativistic retardation of signals implies that the sudden nuclear\ntransition $Z\\!\\to\\! Z-1$ cannot be instantaneously felt by an electron\nin an orbital of mean radius $r$. It takes a time of order $r$ for the orbital\nto be ``informed''. Similarly, the absence of the electron that was captured is felt by\nanother atomic electron after a time of the order of the larger of the two mean\norbital radii.\n\nRecall that the mean radius and binding energy of a Coulombic eigenfunction, in the usual \nnotation, are:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr[n,l]&=&{[3\\,n^2-l(l+1)]/({2 \\,m_e}\\,Z\\,\\alpha)}\\label{radius}\\\\\nE[n]&=&{m_e\\,(Z\\,\\alpha)^2/ (2\\,n^2)}\\label{energy}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nThe quantum-mechanical characteristic time for a bound state to ``react'' to a perturbation is \nthe inverse of its binding energy.

The problem is simply one of QED, like in the case of holmium\nor the slightly harder problem of understanding  the human brain. \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\n\nThe current very preliminary data on the calorimetric spectrum of $^{163}$Ho decay,\n in the region of the N peaks,\nappear to be qualitatively described by the simplified theory we have discussed.\nA similarly preliminary conclusion is that the description of the observations \nbecomes quantitively satisfactory when the various theoretical single- and double-hole features \nare renormalized to fit the data. Once the data improve, we expect this conclusion to\nbecome more solid.\n\n\nOn the way to measure or limit the neutrino mass, the relevant energy domain is \nnot yet explored. It is the\none extending from the M2 and M1 single peaks towards the spectral endpoint,\nthe interval we have analized in detail. It is there that future data \nand the comparison of its features with theory will be of utmost interest.\n\nWe argued that,  relative to the ``old theory\" with only\nsingle-hole contributions,\ndouble-hole effects may enhance the spectral\nendpoint region by a factor of $\\sim \\! 40$. If this is correct, a given statistical goal\nmay be achieved $\\sim\\! 6$ times faster than previously foreseen.\nWe showed that the pileup problem would also be reduced by a similar factor.\n\nWe cannot indubitably trust the above optimistic conclusions. Thus, we have\nalso studied the possibility that double- and single-hole contributions be\nof similar magnitude close to the endpoint. This choice makes\nthe theoretical analysis of the data more challenging. \nBut we have argued that also in this\nvery pessimistic case the introduction of just one extra parameter --besides\nthe two in a linear function of energy, plus Q and $m_\\nu$-- should be enough\nto analyse the data along well-trodden paths.\n\nAn issue that remains to be investigated is the possible existence, in a given\ncalorimeter's substrate, of BEFS oscillations. These would be due \nto Ho-decay electrons undergoing reflections in the crystal lattice \\cite{BEFS}.\n\nThe possibility of a significant contribution of electron shake-ups,\nleading to double-hole spectral peaks, was originally presented as\nvery damning \\cite{Robertson1,Robertson2}. Somewhat ironically, the \nlikely existence of a significant contribution of electron shake-offs\nmay be a very welcome blessing.\n\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\nWe are indebted to Loredana Gastaldo, Angelo Nucciotti and Michael Rabin for fruitful discussions.\nADR acknowledges partial support from the  European Union FP7  ITN INVISIBLES (Marie Curie Actions, PITN- GA-2011- 289442).\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\appendix\n\n\\section{Interferences}\n\\label{app:interferences}\n\nIn the single-hole spectrum of Eq.\\,(\\ref{dRdEc}) quantum interferences have been omitted.\nTo discuss how good an approximation this is, we concentrate on the potentially most significant\ninterference: the one between the M1 and N1 amplitudes. For them to interfere, the $j=\\rm M1,N1$\nholes must decay into the same (generally two-hole) final state $f$. Introduce the notation by\nwriting the corresponding amplitude\nand probability as:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nA_j^f &\\propto& \\phi_j(0) \\; \\frac{\\sqrt{\\gamma_j / \\pi}}{ E-E_j + i\\;\\gamma_j}  \n\\sqrt{b(j \\to f)}\\;e^{{i\\psi_j^f}}\\;, \\label{int1} \\\\\n\\Gamma^f &\\propto& |\\sum_j A_j ^f|^2 = \n\\sum_j |A_j^f|^2\\;+\\; \\sum_{k\\neq j} A_k^f\\,(A_j^f)^*\\;,\n\\label{int2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\gamma_j\\equiv\\Gamma_j/2$ is the half-width, $b(j\\! \\to\\! f)$ is the branching fraction for this decay and $\\psi_j^f$ is the unknown phase. \nSumming over all possible $f$ in Eq.\\,(\\ref{int2}), the first (second) term is the single hole expression \n(the interference). The explicit expression for the latter is:\n \\begin{widetext}\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n2\\, \\phi_{M}(0) \\phi_{N}(0) {\\sqrt{\\gamma_{M} \\gamma_{N}}\\over\\pi}\\;\n\\beta\\,\n\\frac{[(E-E_{M})(E-E_{N})+\\gamma_{M} \\gamma_{N}] \\cos(\\psi)+ [\\gamma_{M}(E-E_{N})-\\gamma_{N}(E-E_{M})] \\sin(\\psi)} \n{[(E-E_{M})^2+\\gamma_{M}^2]\\;[(E-E_{N})^2+\\gamma_{N}^2]} \\, ,\n\\label{inter}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"2\\,\\phi_{M}(0)\\phi_{N}(0){\\sqrt{\\gamma_{M}\\gamma_{N}}\\over\\pi}\\;\\beta\\,\\frac{[%&#10;(E-E_{M})(E-E_{N})+\\gamma_{M}\\gamma_{N}]\\cos(\\psi)+[\\gamma_{M}(E-E_{N})-\\gamma%&#10;_{N}(E-E_{M})]\\sin(\\psi)}{[(E-E_{M})^{2}+\\gamma_{M}^{2}]\\;[(E-E_{N})^{2}+%&#10;\\gamma_{N}^{2}]}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>2</mn></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>M</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+2.8pt\"><mfrac><msqrt><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>M</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>N</mi></msub></mrow></msqrt><mi>\u03c0</mi></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>\u03b2</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>M</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>N</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>M</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>N</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c8</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>M</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>N</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>M</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03c8</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>M</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>M</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo rspace=\"5.3pt\" stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mrow><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>N</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>N</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04990.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere the square of the capture matrix element is $\\propto E_\\nu$.\nSince in this case $E_c=E_B$ one simply has:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 50634, "prevtext": "\n \\end{widetext}\nwhere we have suppressed the $c$ in $E_c$, the\n1 in M1 and N1, $\\beta$ stands for $\\sum_{f} \\sqrt{b(M \\to f)\\;b(N \\to f)}$ and $\\psi$ is the residual unknown phase. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{MaxInterferences.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Generous upper limits to the absolute value of the M1-N1 interferences,\nfor a hypothetical spectrum with only single M1 and N1 captures.\n{\\bf Above}:\nThe spectrum and the maximum interference.\n{\\bf Below}: The ratio of the maximum interference term to the non-interfering\nspectrum.\n}\n\\label{fig:Interferences}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn searching for an upper limit to the interference term, we substitute $\\beta$ by the larger\nnumber $[{\\sum_{f} b(M \\to f) \\times \\sum_{f} b(N \\to f)}]^{1/2}\\sim 0.088$,  where the numerical\nvalue is from \\cite{mac}.

The\ndominant decays consist of a series of Auger or Koster-Kroning transitions \n(in which the neutral Dy* emits electrons, becoming an increasingly charged ion),\nfollowed by transitions in which an outer atomic electron --or one coming from the  \nnegatively charged atomic neighborhood-- drops into the Dy-ion holes.

The corresponding \nphase space expression contains a factor $p_e$, the momentum of the outgoing electron.\nBut, at the relevant very non-relativistic energies, this factor, to a very good approximation,\nis compensated by the ``Fermi-function'', $F\\sim 1/p_e$, which reflects the fact that the \nwave function of the outgoing electron is not that of a free particle,\nbut the one of an electron subject to the field of a charged ion. For any of the soft photon emissions\nin Fig.(\\ref{fig:Auger}) the pertinent width may be modified by a remedial factor \n$E_\\gamma/E_\\gamma^{\\rm max}$, but that function differs very little from unity in its\nnarrow allowed range.\n\n  Finally, anyone of the outgoing photons in Fig.\\,(\\ref{fig:Auger}) may carry all of the energy $E_c\\simeq Q$, requiring a modified width in the corresponding Breit-Wigner. \n But in that case all the other emitted particles have  momenta $p\\simeq 0$\nand the phase space (multiply) vanishes. The multi-body phase space has a multidimensional\npole at the central energies of each of the transitions. At $E_c\\simeq Q$ the overwhelmingly\nmost likely situation corresponds to all energies being close to this multiple pole and adding up\nto $E_c\\simeq Q$. All in all the overall process is described by the naive two-body phase space\nexpression of Eq.~(\\ref{BW}), with its width unmodified.\n\nTo conclude: an event in the process we are discussing can \nbe viewed as the two-body decay of the calorimeter ``before'' to a neutrino and the \nunstable ``excited calorimeter''\nimmediately after. The calorimeter then releases its excess energy\n--which is calorimetrically recorded--\nto return to a new ground state (with one fewer Ho and one extra Dy atoms).\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{999}\n\n\\bibitem{Fermi}\nE.
