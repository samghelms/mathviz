It is\ndesigned to cover a wide energy range, from \\SI{5}{GeV} to\n\\SI{10}{TeV} for electrons and photons and from \\SI{10}{GeV} to\n\\SI{1}{PeV} for heavy ions, with unprecedented\nresolution(\\SI{1.5}{\\percent} for \\SI{100}{\\giga\\electronvolt} electrons).\n\nThe Plastic Scintillator Detector (PSD), located at the top of the\nsatellite, is a key component of DAMPE. It consists of two layers\nof plastic scintillator bars which are orthogonal to each other and\ncovers an effective area of\n$\\SI{820}{mm}\\times\\SI{820}{mm}$. The bars, with a dimension of\n$\\SI{884}{mm} \\times \\SI{28}{\\milli\\meter} \\times \\SI{10}{mm}$, are\nmade of EJ-200~\\cite{scintillator}, and readout at each end by a\nHamamatsu R4443 photomultiplier tub (PMT) , which is a\nlow noise PMT ruggedized for space usage~\\cite{r4443}. The EJ-560 optical pads are used for\ncoupling the bars and the PMTs, which will assure the proper transmission of the scintillation lights.\n\nBy measuring the deposited energy, the PSD serves as an\nanti-coincidence detector for e/$\\gamma$ discrimination as well as a\ncharge detector for heavy ions up to Z=20, and these requires the readout\nsystem of PSD to cover a wide range of signal amplitudes. On the other hand,\nthe limitations on available weight and power imposed by the satellite is also an\nextra constraint in the design of the readout unit.\n\n\nIn this paper, a large dynamic range readout unit with low power consumption for PSD is reported.\nVerification tests for the design have been carried out using cosmic ray and relativistic heavy ion beam, and the results are satisfactory.\nThe detailed description of the design is presented in Sec.\\ref{sec:requirement} and Sec.\\ref{sec:design}, and the test results are discussed in Sec.\\ref{sec:result}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Dynamic range requirement}\n\\label{sec:requirement}\n\nThe dynamic range of the detector maybe influenced by many different factors. To simplify the work, we define the mean light yield produced by a minimum ionizing particle (electron with $\\gamma$ = 5 for example) penetrating vertically through the center of the bar as one MIP, and use it as the unit for the dynamic range estimation.\n\nThe relationship between the response of the scintillator to a charged particle and its scintillation efficiency is one of the most important aspects, which will enlarge the dynamic range requirments. The light yield of organic scintillator is a nonlinear function of the specific energy loss $dE/dx$ due to the quenching effect.\nIt can be described precisely by the Birks' law~\\cite{birks_theory_2013} in the low energy range, while for heavy ions in the relativistic region, the scintillation mechanism is much more complicated and the Birks' law fails to apply directly. Several modified models~\\cite{chou_nature_1952,tarle_cosmic_1979,menchaca-rocha_response_1999,matsufuji_response_1999} have been proposed to extend the Birks law to the high energy region, nevertheless large discrepancy exists between them when extrapolating to the high-Z nuclides.\n\nDue to the theoretical difficulties mentioned above, our estimation of the light yield is based on the direct relativistic heavy ion beam test result of AMS-02 TOF prototype~\\cite{bindi2005performance}, which also uses EJ-200 as the detection material and has the same thickness.\nAccording to the parameters of~\\cite{bindi2005performance}, the light output of calcium (Z=20) is about 270 times larger than that of proton (Z=1).\nAs all minimum ionization particles with Z=1 have approximately the same specific energy loss in the organic material, it means that the light output for all the high energy particle species detected by PSD has a maximum of 270 times difference.\n\nThe second factor we considered is the broad field view of DAMPE, which asks for a maximum incidence angle of \\SI{60}{\\degree}. It indicates that the traversing length and the energy deposit in the bar is double to the perpendicular incident particle, and this expands the maximum light yield to \\SI{540}{MIPs}. Moreover, the statistical nature of the ionizing process should be also taken into account. Assuming the energy resolution of the fluctuation is \\SI{10}{\\percent} ($\\sigma$), an upper limit of the measurable energy deposition per scintillator bar up to 675 MIPs is required as a 5$\\sigma$ width is accepted. And the lower limit of measurement must be smaller than \\SI{0.75}{MIP} on the other hand.\n\nThe third factor is the special shape of the scintillator bar since the light attenuation along the bar could not be negligible in the transmission process.\nTo improve reflection efficiency, the bars are surface-polished and wrapped by the Tyvek paper~\\cite{tyvek}. A preliminary test shows that a reduction ratio in the intensity of the scintillation light can be controlled to \\SI{50}{\\percent} as the incident particle hit the center position perpendicularly. Thus, the light collected by the PMTs at two ends will vary between \\SI{0.375}{MIP} and \\SI{1350}{MIPs}.\n\nConsidered the noise from PMTs and electronics and to ensure the identification of even the smallest signal from noise clearly and leave some redundancy for the adjustment, the final dynamic range demand for the readout unit of PSD is determined to be \\SI{0.1}{MIP}$\\sim$\\SI{1400}{MIPs}.\n\n\\section{Design of the readout unit}\n\\label{sec:design}\n\n\\subsection{Readout scheme}\n\\label{sec:scheme}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=140mm]{readout_scheme}\n\\caption{PSD readout scheme with two measurement ranges.}\n\\label{fig:readout_scheme}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n An ASIC chip VA160, which is developed by IDEAS~\\cite{va160} and optimized for the DAMPE project, is adopted as the major signal processing circuit for the charge measurement of PSD.\n The VA160, with a dynamic range from \\SI{-3}{\\pico\\coulomb} to \\SI{13}{\\pico\\coulomb}, is a low power consumption and radiation harden chip, and optimized for positive input signals from the PMT dynodes output.\n\nTo measure the energy deposition in the range with 4 orders of magnitude at each scintillator bar, it's found that a single VA160 channel is not sufficient to cover the full dynamic range required by the PSD readout unit. A readout system that uses a PMT with double dynode outputs coupled to separate VA160 channels has been developed and performed by the PSD group. Two measurement ranges can be achieved in this way, with the high-gain dynode channel for small light output measurement and the low-gain dynode channel for large light output measurement. To reduce the crosstalk between low-gain and high-gain channels, signals from the two dynodes are connected to different VA160 chips as shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:readout_scheme}.\n\nThe FEE board of PSD which is based on VA160 has been developed and fully tested~\\cite{fee}. The analog to digital conversion is performed by a 14-bit ADC. A linear range up to \\SI{12}{\\pico\\coulomb} is guaranteed for each FEE channel. An input noise level of the whole PSD is expected to not greater than \\SI{6}{\\femto\\coulomb}. This implies the response of \\SI{0.1}{MIPs} shall be larger than \\SI{30}{\\femto\\coulomb} as a 5$\\sigma$ separation is required, i.e. 1 MIP$\\geq$\\SI{300}{\\femto\\coulomb}.\n Thus a dynamic range from \\SI{0.1}{MIPs}$\\sim$\\SI{40}{MIPs} can be achieved by the high-gain dynode channel, and the remaining range shall be covered by the low-gain dynode channel.\nThis constrains the gain ratio between the two dynodes should be larger than $\\geq$35.\n\n\\subsection{Selection of the dynode stages}\n\\label{sec:dynodes_selection}\nTo determine the appropriate dynode stages for readout, an estimation of the mean number of photon electrons (PE) generated by one MIP in the center of the bar is carried out.\n\nThe mean energy deposit of the MIP particle in a \\SI{10}{\\milli\\meter} plastic scintillator is about \\SI{2.0}{\\mega\\electronvolt}~\\cite{olive_review_2014}, and the scintillation efficiency of EJ-200 is \\SI[per-mode=symbol]{e4}{photons\\per\\mega\\electronvolt}~\\cite{scintillator}.\nLight is distributed to both ends of the bar equally.\nHowever, only \\SI{22.5}{\\percent} of the generated photons are within the total reflection angle and will undergo the transmission process to the end of the bar, due to the refraction on the boundary surface.\nThe final number of photon electrons is estimated as follows:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align}\n N_{PEs} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\SI[per-mode=symbol]{2}{\\mega\\electronvolt} \\times \\SI{e4}{\\per\\mega\\electronvolt} \\times 0.225\n           \\times \\varepsilon_{1} \\times \\varepsilon_{2} \\times \\varepsilon_{3} \\times \\varepsilon_{4} \\nonumber \\\\\n         &\\approx \\SI{48}{PEs\\per{MIP}}\n\\label{eq:pes}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle N_{PEs}\" display=\"inline\"><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex1.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\SI[per-mode=symbol]{2}{\\mega\\electronvolt}%&#10;\\times\\SI{e4}{\\per\\mega\\electronvolt}\\times 0.225\\times\\varepsilon_{1}\\times%&#10;\\varepsilon_{2}\\times\\varepsilon_{3}\\times\\varepsilon_{4}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mo>=</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u00d7</mo><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\SI</mtext></merror><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>p</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>r</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>m</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>d</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>s</mi><mi>y</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\mega</mtext></merror><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\electronvolt</mtext></merror><mo>\u00d7</mo><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\SI</mtext></merror><mi>e</mi><mn>4</mn><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\per</mtext></merror><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\mega</mtext></merror><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\electronvolt</mtext></merror><mo>\u00d7</mo><mn>0.225</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi>\u03b5</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi>\u03b5</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi>\u03b5</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>\u00d7</mo><msub><mi>\u03b5</mi><mn>4</mn></msub></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\approx\\SI{48}{PEs\\per{MIP}}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>\u2248</mo><mrow><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\SI</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>48</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>s</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\per</mtext></merror><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>I</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07234.tex", "nexttext": "\nWhere $G$ is the anode current amplification, and $n$ is the number of the dynodes.

Therefore, the total readout system could achieve the demanded wide range of 4 orders, and also provide a cross calibration between this two dynodes.\n\n\\subsection{Voltage divider circuit}\n\\label{sec:divider_design}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=130mm]{divider}\n\\caption{Circuit diagram of the voltage divider.}\n\\label{fig:divider}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nA cathode grouding voltage divider circuit, extracted charge pulses from double dynodes Dy5 and Dy8, is designed as shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:divider}.\nThe uniform voltage distribution ratio is adopted instead of the tapered one because the space charge effects is not an issue at the PSD light intensity level.\n\nIn this design, the parallel decoupling capacitors C1$\\sim$C7 are added to keep the last few interstage voltage stable. Two serial-chained capacitors (C8/C9 and C11/C12) are used in each branch to provide robustness, in case that one of them breaks down and the other can still protect the following circuits. The damp resistors R10/R11 and the bypass capacitors C10/C13 are added to better form the output pulse shape. To minimize the power consumption of the PSD, the power of each PMT divider is designed to less than 20 mW. Moreover,the coaxial cables are used to transmit  the signals from different dynodes but the same PMT to the FEE board to reduce the potential for signal interference.\n\n\n\\section{Verification tests}\n\\label{sec:result}\nBased on the design described above, a prototype of the PSD detector module has been developed and some tests with cosmic ray and high energy ion beams are carried out to check the performance of the readout unit.\n\n\\subsection{Results from cosmic ray tests}\n\\label{sec:cosmicray}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=130mm]{cosmic_test}\n\\caption{The experimental setup for the cosmic ray test.}\n\\label{fig:cosmic_test}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nCosmic ray muons are the most numerous energetic charged particles at the sea level, which are also minimum ionization particles. So they are broadly used to study the MIP response of detectors at the laboratory.\nWe have used the cosmic ray muons to test the PSD prototype also and the layout of the test setup is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cosmic_test}.\nTwo small plastic scintillator detectors ($\\SI{10}{mm} \\times \\SI{10}{mm} \\times \\SI{10}{mm}$) are used to tag the vertically incident cosmic ray, and they are fixed in a movable support to investigate the response difference at various positions along the bar.\n\nThe result from the right side of the prototype module is shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:mip}.\nThe spectrum follows the Landau distribution and the most probable value (MPV) is 396 ADC counts (\\SI{366}{\\femto\\coulomb}).\nBy fitting the lower half of the MIPs peak using Gaussian distribution, the relative resolution is found to be about \\SI{16.6}{\\percent}.\nThe pedestal spectrum of this readout channel is also shown in this figure, and the result of the linearity test from the FEE board is shown in Table ~\\ref{tab:summary}. The value of the RMS noise is 5.8 ADC counts (\\SI{5.4}{\\femto\\coulomb}), which implies the lower limit of the dynamic range for this readout unit is about \\SI{0.08}{MIPs} as a 5$\\sigma$ separation is adopted to distinguish signal to noise.\n\nThe MIPs measurements are then carried out every \\SI{10}{\\centi\\meter} along the bar to investigate the influence of the light attenuation in detail.\nThe relative light output at each position is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:attenuation}.\nThe data can be described precisely by the following model~\\cite{taiuti_measurement_1996}:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 11790, "prevtext": "\nWhere $Q_{n-1}$ is collected charge of the n-th dynode, $Q_{n}$ is emitted charge of the n-th dynode.

And the results from tests using cosmic ray and high energy beams match well with the estimation.\nHowever an adjustment of the PMT supplying voltage is required to obtain the optimal performance and make full use of the measurement range. Due to the large individual differences of PMT, it is also suggested that a detailed measurement of the readout PMTs should be performed to reject tubes with extreme characteristics before the massive production and installation.\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\n\\label{sec:acknowledgement}\n\nThis work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program on Space Science of the Chinese Academy of Science,\nGrant No. XDA04040202- 3.\nThe authors wish to thank all the people from DAMPE collaboration who helped make this work possible.\n\n\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\label{sec:reference}\n\\bibliographystyle{elsarticle-num}\n\n\n\\bibliography{mybib}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15960, "prevtext": "\nThe 8th dynode (Dy8), with a gain of $4.71\\times10^4$ from Eq.~\\ref{eq:dygain}, has a positive charge output \\SI{362} {\\femto\\coulomb} for one MIP signal. It's a little larger than our expectation 300 fC, and the difference can be eliminated easily by fine adjustment of the PMT supply high voltage. To cover the required upper dynamic range, an earlier stage 5th dynode (Dy5) is used to the larger signals measurements, as the maximum relative gain factor across three dynodes is \\SI{63} from a numerical calculation. Therefore, the total readout system could achieve the demanded wide range of 4 orders, and also provide a cross calibration between this two dynodes.\n\n\\subsection{Voltage divider circuit}\n\\label{sec:divider_design}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=130mm]{divider}\n\\caption{Circuit diagram of the voltage divider.}\n\\label{fig:divider}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nA cathode grouding voltage divider circuit, extracted charge pulses from double dynodes Dy5 and Dy8, is designed as shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:divider}.\nThe uniform voltage distribution ratio is adopted instead of the tapered one because the space charge effects is not an issue at the PSD light intensity level.\n\nIn this design, the parallel decoupling capacitors C1$\\sim$C7 are added to keep the last few interstage voltage stable. Two serial-chained capacitors (C8/C9 and C11/C12) are used in each branch to provide robustness, in case that one of them breaks down and the other can still protect the following circuits. The damp resistors R10/R11 and the bypass capacitors C10/C13 are added to better form the output pulse shape. To minimize the power consumption of the PSD, the power of each PMT divider is designed to less than 20 mW. Moreover,the coaxial cables are used to transmit  the signals from different dynodes but the same PMT to the FEE board to reduce the potential for signal interference.\n\n\n\\section{Verification tests}\n\\label{sec:result}\nBased on the design described above, a prototype of the PSD detector module has been developed and some tests with cosmic ray and high energy ion beams are carried out to check the performance of the readout unit.\n\n\\subsection{Results from cosmic ray tests}\n\\label{sec:cosmicray}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=130mm]{cosmic_test}\n\\caption{The experimental setup for the cosmic ray test.}\n\\label{fig:cosmic_test}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nCosmic ray muons are the most numerous energetic charged particles at the sea level, which are also minimum ionization particles. So they are broadly used to study the MIP response of detectors at the laboratory.\nWe have used the cosmic ray muons to test the PSD prototype also and the layout of the test setup is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:cosmic_test}.\nTwo small plastic scintillator detectors ($\\SI{10}{mm} \\times \\SI{10}{mm} \\times \\SI{10}{mm}$) are used to tag the vertically incident cosmic ray, and they are fixed in a movable support to investigate the response difference at various positions along the bar.\n\nThe result from the right side of the prototype module is shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:mip}.\nThe spectrum follows the Landau distribution and the most probable value (MPV) is 396 ADC counts (\\SI{366}{\\femto\\coulomb}).\nBy fitting the lower half of the MIPs peak using Gaussian distribution, the relative resolution is found to be about \\SI{16.6}{\\percent}.\nThe pedestal spectrum of this readout channel is also shown in this figure, and the result of the linearity test from the FEE board is shown in Table ~\\ref{tab:summary}. The value of the RMS noise is 5.8 ADC counts (\\SI{5.4}{\\femto\\coulomb}), which implies the lower limit of the dynamic range for this readout unit is about \\SI{0.08}{MIPs} as a 5$\\sigma$ separation is adopted to distinguish signal to noise.\n\nThe MIPs measurements are then carried out every \\SI{10}{\\centi\\meter} along the bar to investigate the influence of the light attenuation in detail.\nThe relative light output at each position is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:attenuation}.\nThe data can be described precisely by the following model~\\cite{taiuti_measurement_1996}:\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nA(x)=C_0(e^{-x/\\lambda} + \\alpha e^{(2L-x)/\\lambda})\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"A(x)=C_{0}(e^{-x/\\lambda}+\\alpha e^{(2L-x)/\\lambda})\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow></mrow></msup><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>L</mi></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>/</mo><mi>\u03bb</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
