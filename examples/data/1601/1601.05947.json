This has been investigated for a small sample of  local AGNs by Sobolewska and Papadakis, who found that slope variations are well correlated with flux variations, and that spectra are typically steeper in the bright phase (\\textit{softer when brighter} behaviour). Not much information is available for the spectral variability of high-luminosity AGNs and quasars. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we use data from the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue, Data Release 5, which contains X-ray observations for a large number of active galactic nuclei in a wide luminosity and redshift range, for several different epochs. This allows to perform an ensemble analysis of the spectral variability for a large sample of quasars. We quantify the spectral variability through the \\textit{spectral variability parameter} $\\beta$, defined as the ratio between the change in spectral slope and the corresponding logarithmic flux variation. We find that the spectral variability of quasars has a \\textit{softer when brighter} behaviour, similarly to local AGNs.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nActive galactic nuclei are very bright extragalactic objects, located in the dynamical center of their host galaxy, powered by the accretion of matter around a supermassive ($M_{BH}=10^6$-$10^9 M_{\\odot}$) black hole, along a geometrically thin, optically thick disk. This disk is believed to be responsible for the optical/UV emission, while a hot ($T\\simeq10^8$-$10^9$ K) corona is believed to produce hard X-ray photons by comptonization of the disk photons. This emission is responsible for the observed power-law like spectrum in the X-ray band.\\\\\nVariability can be a powerful instrument to probe this physical effect, because it can provide information about both shape and physical behaviour of the corona, which are far from being completely understood.\\\\\nIn addition to the study of amplitude variability, it is also interesting to investigate the spectral variability of active galactic nuclei. This feature has already been studied in the optical/UV band by many authors, (e.g.  [$1$-$3$]) and a \\textit{harder when brighter} behaviour of a power-law spectrum $F\\propto \\nu^{\\alpha}$ has been observed.

It should be stressed that this is an average ensemble estimate, and that the spectral variability behaviour can be different from source to source.\\\\\nGiven the absence of the photon index $\\Gamma$ from our catalogue, we proceeded with simulated data in order to numerically compute the denominator of Eq. \\ref{eq:betagamma} as a function of $\\Gamma$. We have made use of the \\verb|X-SPEC| v.12.9.0 software package [12] to generate some spectral models that could fit our typical sources, using the command \\verb|model zwabs*powerlaw|, that also takes redshift into account. According to the standard unified model of AGN [13], type-$1$ AGNs are unobscured, since they are face-on oriented, which means that the obscuring torus does not affect this kind of active galaxies. One of the spectral models we have considered, therefore, is the unobscured power-law model. Although this is the most likely scenario, one cannot exclude that X-ray obscuration processes are at work, indipendently from optical/UV obscuration processes. Thus, we have also studied some models that include a moderate absorption over a power-law spectrum. We have only considered models with $\\log{N_H}$=21 and $\\log{N_H}=22$.

It should be stressed that this is an average ensemble estimate, and that the spectral variability behaviour can be different from source to source.\\\\\nGiven the absence of the photon index $\\Gamma$ from our catalogue, we proceeded with simulated data in order to numerically compute the denominator of Eq. \\ref{eq:betagamma} as a function of $\\Gamma$. We have made use of the \\verb|X-SPEC| v.12.9.0 software package [12] to generate some spectral models that could fit our typical sources, using the command \\verb|model zwabs*powerlaw|, that also takes redshift into account. According to the standard unified model of AGN [13], type-$1$ AGNs are unobscured, since they are face-on oriented, which means that the obscuring torus does not affect this kind of active galaxies. One of the spectral models we have considered, therefore, is the unobscured power-law model. Although this is the most likely scenario, one cannot exclude that X-ray obscuration processes are at work, indipendently from optical/UV obscuration processes. Thus, we have also studied some models that include a moderate absorption over a power-law spectrum. We have only considered models with $\\log{N_H}$=21 and $\\log{N_H}=22$.
