It is now generally accepted that strong correlations among the \nelectrons lead to the stabilization of this state with such a small gap \\cite{Ueda:review}.\n\\par In the last decade a new group of insulators were discovered, which are gapped in the bulk, but \nthey have soft, topologically protected surface states \n\\cite{Moore2010,topological_insulators:review1,topological_insulators:review2}.  They are the \ntopological insulators whose basic properties can be understood within the framework of ordinary \nband theory. The question naturally arises how the correlation among the electrons affects the \nproperties of topological insulators. This aspect has attracted significant attention\n\\cite{Pesin2010,Maciejko:prl,Ruegg:prl,Tada:prb,Yoshida:prb,Budich:prb,Assaad:jphys,Gregory:prb} \nsince the existence of topological phases was suggested in strongly correlated systems \n\\cite{Nagaosa:prl,Chadov2010,Lin2010,Felser:prb}. These observations made it necessary to \nunderstand, inter alia, the theoretical properties of topological Mott \n\\cite{Pesin2010,LeHur2010,Yoshida2012,Yoshida2014,Ning2015} and Kondo insulators \n\\cite{Colemanprl2010,Coleman2014,Nikolic:2014,Galitskiprb2014,Alexandrov2015,Galitskiprx2015,\nColemanarxiv2015}. The most famous example of topological Kondo insulators is SmB$_6$, which was \ndiscovered more than four decades ago \\cite{Menth1969}. Recent experimental observations \n\\cite{Fiskprb2013,Paglioneprx2013,Kim2013} that SmB$_6$ can host robust conducting surface states \nrenewed the interest in this compound in particular and in Kondo insulators in general \n\\cite{Vojta2015prl,Sigrist2015prl,Balents2015}. The most important aspect of topological Kondo \ninsulators is that \nhybridization occurs between $d$ and $f$ bands whose parities are opposite to each other \n\\cite{Colemanarxiv2015}. This leads to the appearance of a symmetry-protected topological ground \nstate \\cite{Galitskiprx2015}.\n\\par To capture the effects of strong correlations and topology simultaneously, Alexandrov and \nColeman suggested a Kondo lattice model with a special form of the Kondo exchange \n\\cite{Coleman2014}. The model consists of a free one-dimensional electron gas coupled to an $S=1/2$ \nHeisenberg chain via a Kondo exchange with $p$-wave character.  In the conventional \nKondo lattice model, where the Kondo exchange is on-site, local singlets are formed in the \nstrong coupling limit and the boundaries do not play an important role. In contrast, in the present \ncase since they become nonlocal, these singlets are broken at the boundary, \nand edge states appear \\cite{Coleman2014}. This $p$-wave Kondo-Heisenberg model has been \ninvestigated with several methods. The large-$N$ expansion has revealed that magnetic end states \nappear at the boundaries \\cite{Coleman2014}. Analyzing the ground state with Abelian \nbosonization \\cite{Galitskiprx2015} and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm \n\\cite{Gazza2015arxiv}, it has turned out that the ground state is actually the Haldane phase \n\\cite{Haldane1,Haldane2}. \nIt is also interesting to mention that \nHaldane phase has been previously \nobserved in the ordinary Kondo lattice model with ferromagnetic Kondo coupling \\cite{Ueda1992} and \nin the extended periodic Anderson model with Hund's coupling \\cite{Hagymasi2015}.\nThe facts above clearly indicates that one has to apply sophisticated many-body techniques \nto accurately describe the ground state.\n\\par In this Letter our aim is to study the stability of the Haldane phase against \nperturbations.  The \nmost obvious and physically relevant choices are either to introduce anisotropy in the Kondo \ninteraction or the inclusion of a Coulomb interaction in the \nconduction band.  The role of the Coulomb interaction was explored in the case of the \nconventional \nKondo lattice model \\cite{Schork1999,Thalmeier2013}, but only the weak coupling limit of the \npresent model has been \nstudied so far with bosonization \\cite{Galitskiprx2015}. In contrast, the \nanisotropy was studied only in the conventional model and its phase diagram was \ndetermined \\cite{Ueda:anizotrop,Shibata1996363,Novais:anizotrop}. We address these\nproblems using the DMRG algorithm \n\\cite{White:DMRG1,White:DMRG2,schollwock2005,manmana2005,hallberg2006}, which is the \nstate-of-the-art tool to determine the ground state and it makes possible to go beyond the \nweakly interacting limit. Since the DMRG calculation is closely related to the quantum information \ntheory, we can determine the entanglement entropy \n\\cite{legeza2003b,vidallatorre03,calabrese04,legeza2006,rissler2006,luigi2008} and entanglement \nspectrum \\cite{Haldane2008}, which are very useful to detect quantum phase transitions \n\\cite{gu:prl2004,wu:prl2004,yang:pra2005,deng:prb2006} and symmetry-protected topological order \n\\cite{Pollmann2010prb,Pollmann2011prb,Pollmann2012prb}. Our analysis of the anisotropic model \nreveals that (i) a phase \ntransition occurs as the interaction is increased within the conduction band and the Haldane state \ntransforms into a N\\'eel state, and (ii) the entanglement spectrum can be used as a fingerprint to \nidentify a topological Kondo insulator in one dimension.\n\\par \\emph{Model.-} The Hamiltonian of the $p$-wave Kondo-Heisenberg model in one dimension can be \nwritten as:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \n\\label{eq:Hamiltonian}\nH=H_c+H_H+H_K,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H=H_{c}+H_{H}+H_{K},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>H</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>H</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>K</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04606.tex", "nexttext": "\ndescribes the interacting conduction band, with nearest-neighbor hopping $t$ and Hubbard repulsion \n$U$.

In our calculation the a priori value of the quantum information loss, \n$\\chi$, was set to $\\chi=10^{-5}$, and the truncation errors were in the order of magnitude of \n$10^{-7}$. We considered chains with open boundary conditions up to lengths $L=600$. The \nconventional one-dimensional Kondo lattice model was thoroughly investigated in the \nhalf-filled \nand in the metallic case \\cite{Ueda1992,Ueda1999} and no topological order was found. The role of \nthe correlation between the conduction electrons was also addressed and its effect can be \nconsidered as the renormalization of the spin and charge gaps \\cite{Ueda1999}. There are, however, \nonly a few studies available on the $p$-wave Kondo-Heisenberg model \n\\cite{Coleman2014,Galitskiprx2015,Gazza2015arxiv} and the role of the interaction between the \nconduction electrons has been studied only in the weakly interacting case. Furthermore, the effect \nof the anisotropy in the present model is a completely open question.\nTherefore here  we address these aspects using the elements of quantum information theory.\n In what follows we use the half bandwith $W=2t$ as the energy scale and set $J_H=0.5W$, $J_K=W$ and \nvary the anisotropy and the Hubbard interaction strength.

Namely, the \ndegeneracy of the entanglement spectrum, which is obtained from the Schmidt values, can be used to \ncharacterize the topological order. Therefore changes in the character of the whole entanglement\nspectrum must be accompanied by a phase transition, where either a level-crossing occurs or the \ncorrelation length diverges. \n\\par We study the entanglement between the two halves of the chain.
