If the latter includes the interaction between \nparticles, there appears a further complication due to their correlated motion. \nIn elucidating the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity, this intrinsic \ncomplexity in quantum mechanics cannot be avoided but is even more intensified, \nspecifically because superconductivity is a phenomenon in which an assembly of \nelectrons, negatively charged particles with one-half spin, goes into the \npair-condensed phase as a consequence of the dominance of some effective \nattractions between electrons mediated by either phonons, plasmons, \nspin-fluctuations, or orbital-fluctuations over the short-range Coulomb \nrepulsions, indicating the necessity of deeply understanding and carefully \ninvestigating the physics of this charge-spin-phonon(-orbital) complex \nbefore making a reliable evaluation of the transition temperature $T_c$ of \nthis second-order phase transition. Thus one would imagine that the task of \nreliably calculating $T_c$ must be formidably difficult, but the ultimate goal \nin the theoretical study of high-$T_c$ superconductivity should be to construct \na good theoretical framework for an accurate prediction of $T_c$; without such \na theoretical tool, we could never conduct a research directly and intimately \ntouched with the most salient feature of high-$T_c$ materials, namely, the very \nfeature that $T_c$ becomes very high in those materials. \n\nMcMillan was the first to provide a rather successful scheme for \npredicting $T_c$ in the phonon mechanism of superconductivity, starting from \nthe microscopic electron-phonon coupled Hamiltonian. The scheme is known as \nthe McMillan's formula~\\cite{McMillan68}, which was revised later by Allen and \nDynes~\\cite{Allen75,Allen82,Carbotte90}. The formulae, both original and \nrevised, are derived from the Eliashberg theory of \nsuperconductivity~\\cite{Eliashberg60} and the task of a microscopic calculation \nof $T_c$ in this framework is reduced to the evaluation of the so-called \nEliashberg function $\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$ from the first-principles Hamiltonian, \nwhere $F(\\omega)$ is the phonon density of states which may be observed by \nneutron diffraction. This function $\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$ enables us to obtain \nboth the nondimensional electron-phonon coupling constant $\\lambda$ and the \naverage phonon energy $\\omega_0$, through which we can give a first-principles \nprediction of $T_c$ with an additional introduction of a phenomenological \nparameter $\\mu^*$ (the Coulomb pseudopotential~\\cite{Morel62}) for the purpose \nof roughly estimating the effect of the short-range Coulomb repulsion between \nelectrons on $T_c$. \n\nAt present, this framework is usually regarded as the standard one for making \na first-principles prediction of $T_c$ and widely used. In fact, the \nsuperconducting mechanism of many (so-called weakly-correlated) superconductors \nis believed to be clarified by employing this scheme. The key phonon modes to \nbring about superconductivity are identified by investigating the structure of \n$\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$. We can mention that superconductivity in MgB$_2$ with \n$T_c=39$K provides a very good example~\\cite{Bohnen01,Kong01,Choi02a,Choi02b} \nto illustrate the power of this scheme. The case of CaC$_6$ with $T_c=11.5$K \nseems to constitute another recent example~\\cite{Mazin,Mauri}. \n\nIn spite of these and many other successful examples, however, this is not \nconsidered to be our ultimate scheme for calculating $T_c$ from first principles, \nprimarily because a phenomenological parameter $\\mu^*$ is included in the theory. \nActually, it cannot be regarded as the method of predicting $T_c$ in the true \nsense of the word, if the parameter $\\mu^*$ is determined so as to reproduce the \nobserved $T_c$. Besides, as long as $\\mu^*$ is employed to avoid a serious \ninvestigation of the effects of the Coulomb repulsion on superconductivity, this \nscheme cannot be applied to strongly-correlated superconductors such as the \nhigh-$T_c$ cuprates. Even in weakly- or moderately-correlated superconductors, \nthis scheme cannot treat superconductivity originating from the Coulomb repulsion \nvia charge, spin, and/or orbital fluctuations (namely, the electronic mechanism \nincluding the plasmon mechanism~\\cite{Takada78,Takada93a}). Furthermore, in \nthis scheme, we cannot investigate the competition or the coexistence (or even \nthe mutual enhancement due to the quantum-mechanical constructive interference \neffect) between the phonon and the electronic mechanisms. \n\nThe validity of the concept of $\\mu^*$ is closely related to that of the \nEliashberg theory itself; the theory is valid only if the Fermi energy \nof the superconducting electronic system, $E_{\\rm F}$, is much larger \nthan $\\omega_0$. Note that under the condition of $E_{\\rm F}\\gg \\omega_0$, the \ndynamical response time for the phonon-mediated attraction $\\omega_0^{-1}$ is \nmuch slower than that for the Coulomb repulsion $E_{\\rm F}^{-1}$, precluding \nany possible interference effects between two interactions, so that physically \nit is very plausible to separate them. After this separation, the Coulomb part \n(which was not anticipated to play a positive role in the Cooper-pair formation) \nhas been simply treated in terms of a single parameter $\\mu^*$. Thus, for the \npurpose of searching for some positive role of the Coulomb repulsion in \nsuperconductivity, the concept of $\\mu^*$ is irrelevant from the outset of the \nwhole theory. \n\nAs for the condition of $E_{\\rm F}\\gg \\omega_0$, it must also be noted that \nsuch a condition is violated in some recently discovered superconductors in \nthe phonon mechanism including the alkali-doped fullerenes with $T_c = \n18-38$K~\\cite{Hebard91,Takabayashi09,Gunnarsson97,Takada98}. Once it is \nviolated, we need to include higher-order corrections in the electron-phonon \ncoupling (or the so-called vertex corrections $\\Gamma$) in calculating the \nphonon-mediated attractive interaction~\\cite{Takada93b}. Then, it is by no \nmeans clear whether we can fully treat the overall effect of various phonons \nin terms of the sum of the contribution from each phonon. This implies that \nthe Eliashberg function $\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$ will not be appropriate enough to \ndescribe the phonon-mediated attraction because of possible interference \neffects among virtually-excited different phonon modes. As a consequence, \n$\\lambda$ will not be simply the sum of $\\lambda_i$ the contribution from \nthe $i$th phonon, unless $\\lambda_i$ is small enough to validate the whole \ncalculation in lowest-order perturbation. \n\nIf the condition of $E_{\\rm F}\\gg \\omega_0$ is violated, especially if \n$E_{\\rm F}$ is about the same as $\\omega_0$, another complication occurs in \ntreating the screening effect of the conduction electrons. In the usual \ncalculation scheme from first principles, the static screening is assumed in \ncalculating $\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$, but it does not reflect the actual screening \nprocess working during the formation of Cooper pairs. This subtle problem of \nscreening is, of course, also closely related to the problem of the \nfirst-principles determination of $\\mu^*$ and we will not be able to solve these \nproblems unambiguously without confronting with a difficult task of treating \nboth the Coulomb repulsion and the phonon-mediated attraction on the same \nfooting in the calculation of the microscopic {\\it dynamical} electron-electron \neffective interaction $V$. \n\nIn order to overcome the above-mentioned problems inherently associated with \nthe Eliashberg theory, the first and natural option would be to improve on it \nby considering both the gap equation and the electron-electron effective \ninteraction $V$ in entire energy- and momentum-space with properly including \nthe vertex corrections $\\Gamma$ in $V$ and without separating the Coulomb \nrepulsion from $V$. However, this will not be easily accomplished at least in \nthe near future, partly because the demand for computational resources becomes \ntoo much in the solution of the full {\\it nonlocal} and {\\it dynamical} gap \nequation and partly because no controlled approximation scheme has been known \nfor $\\Gamma$ for the superconducting state. (Note that the controlled scheme \nis known for the normal state~\\cite{Takada95,Takada01}.)\n\nFortunately, an alternative option has already been proposed by the extension \nof the density functional theory (DFT) to treating a superconducting \nstate~\\cite{Oliveira88,Kurth99}. This theory provides a formally {\\it exact} \nframework for calcualting $T_c$ from first principles by the solution of the gap \nequation only in momentum-space, setting aside the calculation of other physical \nquantities except for the one-electron density $n({\\bm r})$. Note that the \neffect of the Coulomb repulsion is properly included in this formulation without \nresort to the concept of $\\mu^*$. Therefore we shall begin with making a very \nbrief review of this density fuctional theory for superconductors (SCDFT) in \nSec.~\\ref{sec_takada.2}. We shall point out that the central quantity in this \nframework is the pairing interaction ${\\cal K}$. Then in Sec.~\\ref{sec_takada.3}, \nwe shall infer a concrete formula for ${\\cal K}$ defined in terms of the \nKohn-Sham orbitals in an inhomogeneous electron gas by reconsidering the gap \nequation for the homogeneous electron gas in the weak-coupling region with use \nof the Green's-function method. The formula has not been proposed so far in the \nliterature in SCDFT, but by its application to superconductivity in the alkali- \nand alkaline-earth intercalated graphites~\\cite{Takada09a,Takada09b}, it turns \nout that this is indeed a very good approximate functional form for ${\\cal K}$. \nA prediction for the optimum value of $T_c$ by using this functional form will \nbe given for this class of materials. In Sec.~\\ref{sec_takada.4}, we shall \nconsider a formula for ${\\cal K}$ in the opposite limit, namely, in the \nstrong-coupling region, especially for such superconductors with short coherence \nlengths as the alkali-doped fullerides~\\cite{Takada07}. By interpolating the \nformulae for ${\\cal K}$ in these two limits, we shall propose a new functional \nform for ${\\cal K}$ which is supposed to work well in the whole range of the \ncoupling strength. The results of $T_c$ obtained by its application to the \nfullerene superconductors and related materials will be shown in the last \nsubsection of this section. Finally in Sec.~\\ref{sec_takada.5} we shall conclude \nthis short article, together with discussing the direction of future research. \n\n\n\\section{Density Functional Theory for Superconductors (SCDFT)}\n\\label{sec_takada.2}\n\n\n\\subsection{Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham Theorem}\n\nAccording to the basic theorem in the density functional theory (DFT) due to \nHohenberg and Kohn~\\cite{Hohenberg64}, all the physical quantities of an \ninteracting electron system are uniquely determined, once its electronic density \nin the ground state $n({\\bm r})$ is specified. This implies that every quantity \nincluding the exchange-correlation energy $F_{xc}$ may be considered as a unique \nfunctional of $n({\\bm r})$. The ground-state density $n({\\bm r})$ itself can be \ndetermined by the calculation of the ground-state electronic density of the \ncorresponding noninteracting reference system that is stipulated in terms of \nthe Kohn-Sham (KS) equation~\\cite{Kohn65}. The concept of the noninteracting \nreference system is of central importance in the KS algorithm and the core \nquantity in the KS equation is the exchange-correlation potential \n$V_{xc}({\\bm r})$, which is formally defined as the first-order functional \nderivative of $F_{xc}[n({\\bm r})]$ with respect to $n({\\bm r})$, namely, \n$V_{xc}({\\bm r})=\\delta F_{xc}[n]/\\delta n({\\bm r})$. It must be noted that \n$V_{xc}({\\bm r})$ as well as each one-electronic wavefunction at $i$th level \n(usually called as ``$i$th KS orbital'') with its energy eigenvalue \n$\\varepsilon_i$ in the KS equation has no direct physical relevance; they are \nmerely introduced for the mathematical convenience so as to obtain the \n{\\it exact} $n({\\bm r})$ in the real many-electron system by exploitation of \nits one-to-one correspondence to the noninteracting reference system. \n\nThis basic Hohenberg-Kohn theorem can be applied not only to the normal ground \nstate but also to the ordered one on the understanding that the order parameter \nitself in the ordered state is regarded as a functional of $n({\\bm r})$. \nIn providing some approximate functional form for $F_{xc}[n]$ in actual \ncalculations, however, it would be more convenient to treat the order parameter \nas an additional independent variable. For example, in considering the system \nwith a collinear magnetic order, we usually employ the spin-dependent scheme in \nwhich the fundamental variable is not $n({\\bm r})$ but the spin-decomposed \ndensity $n_{\\sigma}({\\bm r})$, leading to the spin-polarized exchange-correlation \nenergy functional $F_{xc}[n_{\\sigma}]$, based on which the spin-dependent \nexchange-correlation potential is defined to specify the spin-dependent KS \nequation for determining $n_{\\sigma}({\\bm r})$ from first principles. \n\n\n\\subsection{Gap Equation in SCDFT}\n\nIn an essentially similar way, in treating superconductivity in the framework \nof DFT, it would be better to construct the energy functional with employing \nboth $n({\\bm r})$ and the electron-pair density (or the superconducting order \nparameter) $\\chi({\\bm r},{\\bm r'}) (\\equiv \\langle \\Psi_{\\uparrow}({\\bm r})\n\\Psi_{\\downarrow}({\\bm r'})\\rangle)$ as basic variables~\\cite{Oliveira88,Kurth99}, \nleading to the pair-density-dependent exchange-correlation energy functional \n$F_{xc}[n ({\\bm r}),\\chi({\\bm r,r'})]$, where $\\Psi_{\\sigma}({\\bm r})$ is the \nannihilation operator of $\\sigma$-spin electron field at position ${\\bm r}$. \nIn accordance with this addition of the order parameter as a fundamental \nvariable to DFT, not only the exchange-correlation potential $V_{xc}({\\bm r})$ \nbut also the exchange-correlation pair-potential $\\Delta_{xc}({\\bm r},{\\bm r'})\n=-\\delta F_{xc}[n,\\chi]/\\delta \\chi^*({\\bm r},{\\bm r'})$ appear in an extended \nKS equation. \nA beautiful point in this density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT) \nis that the extended KS equation can be written in the form of the Bogoliubov-de \nGennes equation appearing in the conventional theory for inhomogeneous \nsuperconductors~\\cite{deGennes66}. Just as is the case with $V_{xc}({\\bm r})$, \n$\\Delta_{xc}({\\bm r},{\\bm r'})$ has no direct physical meaning, but in principle, \nif the exact form of $F_{xc}[n,\\chi]$ is known, the solution of the extended \nKS equation gives us the exact result for $\\chi({\\bm r},{\\bm r'})$, containing all \nthe effects of the Coulomb repulsion including the one usually treated \nphenomenologically through the concept of $\\mu^*$. As a result, we can \ndetermine the exact $T_c$ by the calculation of the highest temperature below \nwhich a nonzero solution for $\\chi({\\bm r},{\\bm r'})$ can be found. \n\nIn this framework of SCDFT, we can formally write down the fundamental gap \nequation to determine $T_c$ {\\it exactly} as~\\cite{Units-here}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta_j = -\\sum_{j'} {\\Delta_{j'} \\over \n2\\varepsilon_{j'}} \\tanh {\\varepsilon_{j'} \n\\over 2T_c} \\, {\\cal K}_{jj'},\n \\label{eq:SCDFT}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\Delta_j$ is the gap function associated with $j$th KS orbital. In just \nthe same way as its energy eigenvalue $\\varepsilon_j$ (which is measured \nrelative to the chemical potential), $\\Delta_j$ is not the quantity to be observed \nexperimentally but just introduced for the mathematical convenience so as to \nobtain the exact $T_c$ by solving this BCS-type equation, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}). \nSimilarly, the pairing interaction ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$, defined as the second-order \nfunctional derivative of $F_{xc}[n ,\\chi]$ with respect to $\\chi^*$ and $\\chi$, \nhas not any direct physical meaning, either, although this is a quantity of \nprimary importance in this gap equation or even in the whole framework of SCDFT. \n\nThree comments are in order: (i) The functional derivatives of $F_{xc}[n ,\\chi]$ \nmight not be well defined, as anticipated by remembering the notorious \nenergy-gap problem in semiconductors and insulators~\\cite{Perdew83,Sham83,Sham85}, \nbut as is ordinally the case, we shall assume that ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ is a \nwell-defined quantity. (ii) In this formal derivation in SCDFT, the \ndynamical (or $\\omega$-dependent) nature in the electron-electron multiple \nscatterings does not manifest itself in either the gap equation or the pairing \ninteraction, in sharp contrast with the Eliashberg theory. For this reason, many \npeople cast doubt on whether the physics leading to $\\mu^*$ is actually taken \ninto account in SCDFT. However, due to the fact that there is a very good \ncorrespondence between this gap equation and the one in the $G_0W_0$ approximation \nto the Elishaberg theory, as will be shown in the next section, we find that \nit is possible to include the full dynamical processes in the Cooper-pair \nformation in the framework of SCDFT, as long as the form of ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ is \nproperly chosen. (iii) At $T=T_c$, ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ is evaluated at $\\chi=0$. \nThus ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ must be a functional of only the normal-state electronic \ndensity $n({\\bm r})$. Note that each KS orbital, $j$ or $j'$, determined in the \nnormal state may be regarded as a functional of $n({\\bm r})$, justifying the \nview that ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ at $T=T_c$ is eventually a functional of $n({\\bm r})$ \nin the normal state. \n\n\n\\subsection{Application and Discussion}\n\nThis formal framework of SCDFT was not applied to actual superconductors before \nthe year 2005 when an attempt was made to provide a concrete approximate form for \n$F_{xc}[n ,\\chi]$ in which the contribution from the phonon-mediated attraction \nwas explicitly included up to the level of the Eliashberg theory~\\cite{Luders05}. \nSince then many (but mostly weakly-correlated) superconductors have been \nanalyzed rather successfully in this \nframework~\\cite{Sanna07,Marques05,Floris05,Profeta06,Sanna06,Floris07}. \n\nIn the judgement of the present author, the presently available form for \n$F_{xc}[n ,\\chi]$ or the one for ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ contains the information \nequivalent to that included in the Eliashberg theory for the part of the \nphonon-mediated attraction, indicating that no vertex corrections are \nconsidered in this treatment (amounting to the very insufficient treatment \nof the strong polaronic effect), while for the part of the Coulomb repulsion, it \ncontains only very crude physics; the screening effect is treated in the Thomas-Fermi \nstatic-screening approximation, or the result in the random phase approximation \n(RPA) only in the static and the long-wavelength limit, neglecting both the \ndynamical and nonlocal feature in the effects of the Coulomb repulsion. This \nclearly indicates that the Coulomb repulsion is not treated on the same footing \nas the phonon-mediated attraction and this approximation for the Coulomb part \nwill be just good for describing the physics represented by $\\mu^*$ at usual \nmetallic densities (or $r_s \\approx 2$ with $r_s$ the conventional \nnondimensional density parameter) from first principles, but it fails to take \ncare of the detailed dynamical nature of the screening effect, especially, \nthe positive role of the plasmons in superconductivity for lower densities (or \nlarger $r_s$)~\\cite{Takada78,Takada93a}. Furthermore, the presently available \nform for $F_{xc}[n ,\\chi]$ or ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ does not allow to discuss other \ntypes of the electronic mechanisms such as the spin-fluctuation one, either. In \nview of these fundamental problems, it is absolutely necessary to derive a much \nbetter approximate functional form for ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ for the purpose of \ninvestigating the electronic mechanisms in the absence/presence of the phonon \nmechanism. \n\nIt would be appropriate here to make a rather general comment on numerical \nerrors. Currently, calculations of the normal-state properties are done \nin either the local-density approximation (LDA) or the generalized gradient \napproximation (GGA)~\\cite{Perdew96} to $F_{xc}[n({\\bm r})]$ in DFT. We usually \nanticipate that errors in the calculated results are of the order of 1eV and \n0.3eV for LDA and GGA, respectively, and those errors are much larger than that \nexpected in quantum chemistry ($\\approx 0.05$eV). Now in the usual procedure in \nSCDFT, the calculation of $T_c$ (which is of the order of 0.001eV in general) is \ndone simultaneously with that of the normal state and thus the error for $T_c$ \nmight be of the same order as that for the normal-state properties, implying \nthat it might become much larger than $T_c$ itself. \n\nThis unfavorable situation may be avoided, if we take the following two-stage \nstrategy for the calculation of $T_c$ for a family of superconducting materials \nin consideration; in the first stage, combined with available experimental \nresults on the normal state, we establish a good model system representing this \nfamily of superconductors by making a first-principles band-structure calculation \nand then in the second stage, we evaluate $T_c$ based on the model system not \nonly for reproducing the experimental $T_c$ but also for suggesting not yet \nsynthesized but promising superconductors with higher $T_c$ in this family. In \nthe rest of this article, we shall discuss two families of the carbon-based \nsuperconductors for which $T_c$s are calculated and predicted in accordance \nwith this two-stage strategy. \n\n\n\\section{G$_0$W$_0$ Approximation with Application to Graphite Intercalation Compounds}\n\\label{sec_takada.3}\n\n\n\\subsection{Pairing Interaction in the Weak-Coupling Region}\n\nThe three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous electron gas has been known to be a very \nuseful system in constructing a successful functional form for $V_{xc}({\\bm r})$ \nin either LDA or GGA by its study with use of various powerful many-body \ntechniques including quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In view of this success, \nwe shall study superconductivity in the same system with the conventional \nGreen's-function method in order to infer a good functional form for the \npairing interaction ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}) that will be exact \nin the weak-coupling limit. \n\nIn a homogeneous system, momentum ${\\bm p}$ is always a good quantum number and \nan electron can be specified by ${\\bm p}$ and spin $\\sigma$.

Since the KS \norbitals, $j$ and $j'$, can be specified by momenta, ${\\bm p}$ and ${\\bm p'}$, \nrespectively, in a homogeneous system and $\\varepsilon_{j'}=\\varepsilon_{\\bm p'}$, \nwe may regard that these two equations are esssentially the same, suggesting \nthat we may give a concrete functional form for ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ with use of \nenergies of the KS orbitals, $\\varepsilon_j$ and $\\varepsilon_{j'}$, as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal K}_{jj'} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\!{2 \\over \\pi}\\,d\\Omega\\,\n{|\\varepsilon_{j}|+|\\varepsilon_{j'}| \n\\over \\Omega^2+ \n(|\\varepsilon_{j}|+|\\varepsilon_{j'}|)^2}\\,V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)\\,.\n \\label{eq:F5a}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ is the dynamical effective interaction working for the \nscattering process from a pair of electrons in $(j,j^*)$ orbitals to another \npair in $(j',{j'}^*)$ orbitals, as schematically shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig1_takada} \n(By $j^*$ we mean the time-reversed KS orbital of $j$.) \nWe should calculate this $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ on the understanding that it must \nbe derived from the first-principles Hamiltonian expanded with use of a \ncomplete set of the KS orbitals as an orthnormal basis. Together with the gap \nequation, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}), and the KS orbitals obtained in the normal \nstate by the conventional DFT-based method, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F5a}) constitutes a \nbasic framework for a first-principles calculation of $T_c$ for inhomogeneous \nweak-coupling superconductors. \n\n\n\\subsection{Superconductivity in Polar Semiconductors}\n\nIn order to assess the quality of this basic framework in the G$_0$W$_0$ \napproximation for calculating $T_c$ from first principles, we have applied it \nto polar degenerate semiconductors, specifically, the doped SrTiO$_3$ and \ncompared the calculated results with experiments~\\cite{Takada80}. \n\nThis material is an insulator and exhibits ferroelectricity under a uniaxial \nstress of about 0.16GPa along the [100] direction, but it turns into an $n$-type \nsemiconductor by either Nb doping or oxygen deficiency, whereby the conduction \nelectrons are introduced in the 3d band of Ti around the $\\Gamma$ point with the \nband mass of $m^* \\approx 1.8m_e$ ($m_e$: the mass of a free electron). At low \ntemperatures, superconductivity appears and the observed $T_c$ shows interesting \nfeatures; $T_c$ depends strongly on the electron concentration $n$ and it is \noptimized with $T_c \\approx 0.3$K at $n \\approx 10^{20}$cm$^{-3}$. Its dependence \non the pressure is unsual; $T_c$ decreases rather rapidly with hydrostatic \npressures, but it increases with the [100] uniaxial stress, implying that \nthe superconductivity is brought about by the polar-coupling phonons associated \nwith the stress-induced ferroelectric phase transition, \n\nTaking those situations into account, we have assumed that the material is well \nrepresented by a model of the 3D electron-gas system coupled with polar-optical \nphonons in which a concrete form for $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ can be derived in RPA as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV({\\bm q},i\\Omega)={4\\pi e^2 \\over \\epsilon({\\bm q},i\\Omega)\\,{\\bm q}^2 },\n\\label{eq:F5b}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the dielectric function in the electron-optical phonon system as \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 29451, "prevtext": "\nThen, by making an analytic continuation on the $\\omega$ plane to transform \n$F({\\bm p},i\\omega_p)$ to the retarded function $F^{R}({\\bm p},\\omega)$ on the \nreal-$\\omega$ axis and using the general relation due to the causality principle as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV^R({\\bm q},\\omega)=V_0({\\bm q})\\!\n-\\!\\int_0^{\\infty}\\! \\frac{d\\Omega}{\\pi} \n\\frac{2\\Omega}{\\omega^2 \\!-\\! \\Omega^2 +i\\eta}\n\\, {\\rm Im}V^R({\\bm q},\\Omega),\n\\label{eq:F2b}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $\\eta$ a positive infinitesimal, we end up with a gap equation for \n$F^{R}({\\bm p},\\omega)$.

Among various kinds of GICs, special attention has \nbeen paid to the first-stage metal compounds, mainly because superconductivity \nis observed only in this class of GICs, the chemical formula of which is written \nas $M$C$_x$, where $M$ represents either an alkali atom (such as Li, K, Rb, and \nCs) or an alkaline-earth atom (such as Ca, Sr, and Yb) and $x$ is either $2$, \n$6$, or $8$. The crystal structure of $M$C$_x$ is shown in \nFig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(a), in which the metal atom $M$ occupies the same spot \nin the framework of a honeycomb lattice at every $(x/2)$ layers of carbon atoms. \n\nThe first discovery of superconductivity in GICs was made in KC$_8$ with the \nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of 0.15K in 1965~\\cite{Hannay65}. \nIn pursuit of higher $T_c$, various GICs were synthesized, mostly working with \nthe alkali metals and alkali-metal amalgams as intercalants, from the late 1970s \nto the early 1990s~\\cite{Koike78,Kobayashi79,Koike80,Alexander80,Iye,Belash89a,\nDresselhaus89,Belash90}, but only a limited success was achieved at that time; \nthe highest attained $T_c$ was around 2-5K in the last century. For example, \nit is 1.9K in LiC$_2$~\\cite{Belash89b}. \n\nA breakthough occurred in 2005 when $T_c$ went up to 11.5K in CaC$_6$~\\cite{CaC6,\nEmery} (and even to 15.4K under pressures up to 7.5GPa~\\cite{Takagi}). In other \nalkaline-earth GICs, the values of $T_c$ are 6.5K and 1.65K for \nYbC$_6$~\\cite{CaC6} and SrC$_6$~\\cite{Kim2}, respectively. Since then, \nvery intensive experimental studies have been made in those and related \ncompounds~\\cite{Emery,Kim2,Kim1,Kurter}. Theoretical studies have also been \nperformed mainly by making state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of \nthe electron-phonon coupling constant $\\lambda$ to account for the observed \nvalue of $T_c$ for each individual superconductor~\\cite{Mazin,Csanyi,Mauri,\nSanna07}. Those experimental/theoretical works have elucidated that, although \nthere are some anisotropic features in the superconducting gap, the conventional \nphonon-driven mechanism to bring about s-wave superconductivity applies to those \ncompounds. This picture of superconductivity is confirmed by, for example, the \nobservation of the Ca isotope effect with its exponent $\\alpha=0.50$, the \ntypical BCS value~\\cite{Hinks}. \n\nIn spite of all those efforts and the existence of such a generally accepted \npicture, we need to know more important and fundamental issues that include: \n\n\\noindent\n(i) Standard model: Can we understand the mechanism of superconductivity in \nboth alkali GICs with $T_c$ in the range $0.01-1.0$K and alkaline-earth GICs \nwith $T_c$ in the range $1-10$K from a unified point of view? In other words, \nis there any standard model for superconductivity in GICs with $T_c$ ranging \nover three orders of magnitude? \n\n\\noindent\n(ii) Key parameters to control $T_c$: What is the actual reason why $T_c$ is \nenhanced so abruptly (or by about a hundred times) by just substituting K by Ca \nthe atomic mass of which is almost the same as that of K? In terms of the \nstandard model, what are the key controlling physical parameters to bring about \nthis huge enhancement of $T_c$? This change of $T_c$ from KC$_8$ to CaC$_6$ is \nprobably the most important issue in exploring superconductivity across the \nentire family of GICs. \n\n\\noindent\n(iii) Optimum $T_c$: Is there any possibility to make a further enhancement of \n$T_c$ in GICs? If possible, what is the optimum value of $T_c$ expected in the \nstandard model and what kind of atoms should be intercalated to realize the \noptimum $T_c$ in actual GICs? \n\nRecently these three issues have been satisfactorily addressed by the present \nauthor~\\cite{Takada09a,Takada09b}, as shall be explained one by one in the \nfollowing three subsections. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.0cm]{fig3.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{(a) Crystal structure of $M$C$_x$\\ ($x$=$2,\\,6,\\,8$). The case of $x$\n=$6$ is illustrated here, in which the metal atoms, $M$s, are arranged in a rhombohedral \nstructure with the $\\alpha \\beta \\gamma$ stacking sequence, implying that \n$M$ occupies the same spot in the framework of a graphene lattice at every \nthree layers (or at the distance of $3d$ with $d$ the distance between the \nadjacent graphite layers). \n(b) Simplified model to represent $M$C$_x$ superconductors. \nWe consider the attraction between the 3D electrons in the interlayer band \ninduced by polar-coupled charge fluctuations of the cation $M^{Z+}$ and \nthe anion C$^{-\\delta}$. \n(c) Superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in the first-stage alkali- \nand alkaline-earth-intercalated graphites plotted as a function of $d$. \nThe solid circles show the experimental results, while the crosses the \ncalculated ones in the G$_0$W$_0$ approximation for the model represented \nin (b) with suitable values for the parameters such as $Z$, $m^*$, and $f$ \nfor each $M$C$_x$.}\n\\label{fig3_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Standard Model for Intercalated Graphite Superconductors}\n\nThe usual DFT-based self-consistent band-structure calculation is useful in \nelucidating the electronic structures of GICs in the normal state, basically \nbecause GICs are not strongly-correlated materials. According to such a \ncalculation, no essential qualitative difference is found between alkali and \nalkaline-earth GICs. The main common features among these GICs may be \nsummarized as follows: \n\nFirst of all, each intercalant metal atom in $M$C$_x$ acts as a donor and \nchanges from a neutral atom $M$ to an ion $M^{Z+}$ with valence $Z$. Then, \nthe valence electrons released from $M$ will transfer either to the graphite \n$\\pi$ bands or the three-dimensional (3D) band composed of the intercalant \norbitals and the graphite interlayer states~\\cite{Posternak84,Holzwarth84,\nKoma86}. We shall define the factor $f$ as the branching ratio between these \ntwo kinds of bands. Namely, $Zf$ and $Z(1-f)$ electrons will go to the $\\pi$ \nand the 3D bands, respectively. The electrons in the graphite $\\pi$ bands are \ncharacterized by the two-dimensional (2D) motion with a linear dispersion \nrelation (known as a Dirac cone in the case of graphene) on the graphite layer. \n\nThe dispersion relation of the graphite interlayer band is very similar to \nthat of the 3D free-electron gas, folded into the Brillouin zone of the \ngraphite~\\cite{Csanyi}. Thus its energy level is very high above the Fermi \nlevel in the graphite, because the amplitude of the wavefunction for this band \nis small on the carbon atoms. In $M$C$_x$, on the other hand, the cation \n$M^{Z+}$ is located in the interlayer position where the amplitude of the \nwavefunctions is large, lowering the energy level of the interlayer band \nbelow the Fermi level. The dispersion of the interlayer band is modified \nfrom that of the free-electron gas because of the hybridization with the \norbitals associated with $M$, but generally it is well approximated by \n$\\varepsilon_{\\bm p}={\\bm p}^2/2m^*-E_{\\rm F}$ with an appropriate choice of \nthe effective band mass $m^*$ and the Fermi energy $E_{\\rm F}$. Here the value \nof $m^*$ depends on $M$; in alkali GICs, the hybridization occurs with \ns-orbitals, allowing us to consider that $m^*=m_e$, while in alkaline-earth \nGICs, the hybridization with d-orbitals conrtibutes much, leading to \n$m^* \\approx 3m_e$ in both CaC$_6$ and YbC$_6$, as revealed by \nthe band-structure calculation~\\cite{Mazin,Mauri}. \n\nThe value of $f$, which determins the branching ratio $Zf:Z(1-f)$, can be \nobtained by the self-consistent band-structure calculation. In KC$_8$, for \nexample, it is known that $f$ is around $0.6$~\\cite{Ohno79,Wang91}. On the \nother hand, $f$ is about $0.16$ in CaC$_6$, making the electron density in \nthe 3D band $n$ increase very much~\\cite{Mauri}. This increase in $n$ is \neasily understood by the fact that the energy level of the interlayer band \nis much lower with Ca$^{2+}$ than with K$^+$. The concrete numbers for \n$n$ are $3.5 \\times 10^{21}$cm$^{-3}$ and $2.4 \\times 10^{22}$cm$^{-3}$ \nfor KC$_8$ and CaC$_6$, respectively, in which the difference in both $d$ and \n$x$ is also taking into account. \n\nAs inferred from experiments~\\cite{PhysToday2,Csanyi} and also from \nthe comparison of $T_c$ calculated for each band~\\cite{Takada82}, \nit has been concluded that only the 3D interlayer band is responsible for \nsuperconductivity. Note that LiC$_6$ does not exhibit superconductivity \nbecause no carriers are present in the 3D interlayer band, although the \nproperties of LiC$_6$ are generally very similar to those of other \nsuperconducting GICs in the normal state. \n\nWith the above-mentioned common features in mind, we can think of a simple \nmodel of a 3D electron gas coupled with phonons for the GIC superconductors, \nwhich is schematically shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(b). In order to give \nsome idea about the mechanism to induce an attraction between 3D electrons in \nthis model, let us imagine how each conducting 3D electron sees the charge \ndistribution of the system. First of all, there are posively charged metallic \nions $M^{Z+}$ with its density $n_M$, given by $n_M=4/3\\sqrt{3}\\,a^2dx$, where \n$a$ is the bond length between C atoms on the graphite layer (which is \n1.419\\AA). Note that with use of this $n_M$, the density of the 3D electrons \n$n$ is given by $(1-f)Zn_M$. There are also negatively charged carbon ions \nC$^{-\\delta}$ with $\\delta$ given by $\\delta=fZ/x$ on the average. Therefore \nthe 3D electrons will feel a large electric field of the polarization wave \ncoming from oscillations of $M^{Z+}$ and C$^{-\\delta}$ ions created by either \nout-of-phase optical or in-phase acoustic phonons. \n\nAlthough there are some additional complications originating from the combined \ncontributions from both optical and acoustic modes in the layered-lattice \nsystem, this coupling of an electron with the polar phonons is essentially \nsimilar to the one we have already considered in the previous subsection. Thus \nit is straightforward to derive the effective interaction $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ \nin RPA in which the bare Coulomb repulsion and the polar-phonon-mediated \nattraction are treated on the same footing with the screening effects of both \nthe 2D and 3D electrons. A concrete form for $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ will not be \ngiven here, but for its detailed derivation we refer to the original \npaper~\\cite{Takada82} in which exactly the same model as presented in \nFig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(b) was proposed in as early as 1982 by the present \nauthor for analyzing superconductivity in alkali GICs. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Key Physical Parameters to Control Superconductivity}\n\nWe have evaluated $T_c$ from first principles by using $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ \nthus obtained to solve the gap equation~(\\ref{eq:F3}). \nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(c), the calculated results of $T_c$ for various \n$M$C$_x$ are plotted by the crosses with the choice of suitable values for \nthe parameters such as $Z$, $m^*$, and $f$ for each material. As we see, the \nagreement between theory and experiment is quite excellent across the \nentire family of GICs, implying that our simple model may well be regarded as \nthe standard one for describing the mechanism of superconductivity in GICs. \n\nIn order to identify the controlling physical parameters to enhance $T_c$ \nin CaC$_6$ by a handred times from that in KC$_8$, let us compare the \nvalues for the physical parameters between the two materials: \n(i) The valence $Z$; because the valence changes from monvalence to divalence, \nthe value of $Z$ in CaC$_6$ is doubled to make the bare polar-phonon-mediated \nattraction (which is in proportion to $Z^2$) stronger by four times. \n(ii) The interlayer distance $d$; it decreases from $5.42$\\AA\\ to $4.524$\\AA, \nso that the 3D electron density $n$ increases in CaC$_6$. \n(iii) The factor $f$ to determine the branching ratio; it decreases from \nabout $0.6$ to $0.16$, which also makes a further increase in $n$. \n(iv) The effective band mass for the 3D interlayer band $m^*$; it increases \nfrom $m_e$ to about $3m_e$, leading to a large enhancement of the density \nof states at the Fermi level.\n(v) The atomic number of the ion $A$; it changes only from $39.1$ in K \nto $40.1$ in Ca. Thus the energies of phonons hardly change. \n\nWe have recalculated $T_c$ by shifting each parameter, one by one, from the \nabove-mentioned respective physical value and have found that two parameters, \nnamely, $Z$ and $m^*$, are very important in controlling the overall magnitude \nof $T_c$. In fact, $T_c$ is enhanced by one order of magnitude from that in \nKC$_8$ by doubling $Z$ from $Z=1$ to $Z=2$ with $m^*$ kept to be $m_e$. \nA further enhancement of $T_c$ by another one order is seen by tripling $m^*$ \nfrom $m_e$ to $3m_e$, with $Z$ kept to be $Z=2$. Thus we may conclude that the \nenhancement of $T_c$ in CaC$_6$ by about a hundred times from that in KC$_8$ is \nbrought about by the combined effects of doubling $Z$ and tripling $m^*$. In \nthis respect, the actual value of $m^*$ is very important. Appropriateness of \n$m^* \\approx 3m_e$ is confirmed not only from the band-structure \ncalculations~\\cite{Mazin,Mauri} but also from the measurement of the electronic \nspecfic heat~\\cite{Kim1} compared with the corresponding one for \nKC$_8$~\\cite{Mizutani78}.\n\nA note will be added here on the case of YbC$_6$; the basic parameters such \nas $Z$, $f$, and $m^*$ for YbC$_6$ are about the same as those for CaC$_6$, \naccording to the band-structure calculation. The only big difference can be seen \nin the atomic mass; Yb (in which $A=173.0$) is much heavier than that of Ca \nby about four times, indicating weaker couplings between electrons and polar \nphonons as just in the case of comparison between KC$_8$ and RbC$_8$ or CsC$_8$. \nIn fact, $T_c$ for YbC$_6$ becomes about one half of the corresponding result for \nCaC$_6$, which agrees well with experiment. One way to understand this difference \nis to regard it as an isotope effect with $\\alpha \\approx 0.5$~\\cite{Mazin}. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Prediction of Optimum $T_c$}\n\\label{sec:8}\n\nAs we have seen so far, our standard model could have predicted $T_c =11.5$K \nfor CaC$_6$ in 1982 and it is judged that its predictive power is very high. \nIncidentally, the author did not perform the calculation of $T_c$ for \nCaC$_6$ at that time, partly because he did not know a possibility to synthesize \nsuch GICs, but mostly because the calculation cost was extremely high in \nthose days; a rough estimate shows that there is acceleration in computers by \nat least a millon times in the past three decades. This huge improvement \non computational environments is surely a boost to making such a first-principles \ncalculation of $T_c$ in the G$_0$W$_0$ approximation. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6.0cm]{fig4.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Prediction of $T_c$ as a function of $m^*$ for various \nGICs in pursuit of optimum $T_c$. We assume the fractional factor $f=0$.}\n\\label{fig4_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe have explored the optimum $T_c$ in the whole family of GICs by widely \nchanging various parameters involved in the microscopic Hamiltonian of \nthe standard model. Examples of the calculated results of $T_c$ are shown in \nFig.~\\ref{fig4_takada}, in which $f$ is fixed to zero, the optimum \ncondition to raise $T_c$, and $d$ is tentatively taken as 4.0\\AA. From this \nexploration, we find that the most \nimportant parameter to enhance $T_c$ is $m^*$. In particular, we need $m^*$ \nlarger than at least $2m_e$ to obtain $T_c$ over 10K, irrespective of any \nchoice of other parameters, and $T_c$ is optimized for $m^*$ in the range \n$(10-20)m_e$. The optimized $T_c$ depends rather strongly on the parameters to \ncontrol the polar-coupling strength such as $Z$ and the atomic mass $A$; if we \nchoose a trivalent light atom such as boron to make $\\omega_t(0)$ large, the \noptimum $T_c$ is about 100K, but the problem about the light atoms is that $m^*$ \nwill never become heavy due to the absence of either d or f electrons. Therefore \nwe do not expect that $T_c$ would become much larger than 10K, even if BeC$_2$ or \nBC$_2$ were synthesized. From this perspective, it will be much better to \nintercalate Ti or V, rather than Be or B. Taking all these points into account, \nwe suggest synthesizing three-element GICs providing a heavy 3D electron system \nby the introduction of heavy atoms into a light-atom polar-crystal environment. \n\n\n\n\\section{Strong-Coupling Approach with Application to Fullerides}\n\\label{sec_takada.4}\n\n\n\\subsection{Coherence Length}\n\nIn the BCS theory for superconductivity which is applicable to superconductors \nin the weak-coupling region, $T_c$ is directly related to the coherence length \n$\\xi_0$ which characterizes the spatial extent of the wave function representing \nthe bound state of a Cooper pair at zero temperature. More concretely, the \nrelation between them is expressed as $T_c/E_F = 2e^{\\gamma}/\\pi^2 (p_F\\xi_0)^{-1} \n\\approx 0.361/p_F\\xi_0$ with $\\gamma\\,(=0.57721\\cdots)$ the Euler-Mascheroni \nconstant and $p_F$ the Fermi wave number. Because $p_F^{-1}$ is in proportion \nto the lattice constant $a_0$, the relation is rewritten into the form as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{T_c \\over E_F} \\ \\approx \\ 0.0735\\,{a_0 \\over \\xi_0}\n\\label{eq:F15}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nfor a monovalent metal in the fcc-lattice structure. (For other valence and/or \ncrystal structure, the coefficient of 0.0735 changes, but it always remains in \nthe same order of magnitude.) For usual elemental superconductors, $T_c/E_F$ is \nof the order of $10^{-4}$ and thus $\\xi_0$ is about a thousand times larger than \n$a_0$, validating the approach in momentum space. On the other hand, the relation \nin Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F15}) implies that high $T_c$ is inevitably associated with short \n$\\xi_0$. In fact, $\\xi_0$ is observed as only a few nm or less, i.e., of the \nsame order of $a_0$ in many of the recently synthesized high-$T_c$ \nsuperconductors~\\cite{Text} such as the cuprates, the alkali-doped C$_{60}$, \nand MgB$_2$. \n\nA similar message can be obtained through the so-called Uemura \nplot~\\cite{Uemura91a,Uemura91b,Takada92}, according to which there is a universal \nrelation of $T_c/E_F \\approx 0.04$ for a wide variety of strong-coupling \nsuperconductors. If this relation is put into Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F15}), we obtain \n$\\xi_0 \\approx 2\\,a_0$. Furthermore, if we think of the Bose-Einstein \ncondensation (BEC) for an assembly of very tightly-bound pairs of electrons, \nthe condensation temperature (which amounts to $T_c$ in such a system) is given \nby $T_c/E_F=(2/9\\pi\\, \\zeta(3/2)^2)^{1/3}\\approx 0.218$, where $\\zeta(3/2)\\,\n(=2.6124\\cdots)$ is the Riemann's zeta function $\\zeta(x)$ at $x=3/2$. This \nvalue of $T_c/E_F$ (which must be the optimum value for fermionic superconductors) \nsuggests $\\xi_0 \\approx 0.3\\,a_0$. Thus, in treating superconductivity in the \nstrong-coupling region, we need to consider a situation of extremely short $\\xi_0$, \nvalidating the approach in real space, which is totally different from that of \nvery long $\\xi_0$ in the weak-coupling superconductors. \n\n\n\\subsection{Pairing Interaction in the Strong-Coupling Region}\n\nIn view of the above-mentioned difference in $\\xi_0$, we shall exploit the \nshortness of $\\xi_0$ in reformulating the problem of making a quantitative \ncalculation of $T_c$ for strong-coupling superconductors in the Green's-function \napproach~\\cite{Takada07}. Let us start with this reformulation by considering \nthe dynamical correlation function for singlet pairing of two electrons in the \nnormal state $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)$, which is defined as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)=-i \\int_0^{\\infty}dt\\,e^{i\\omega t -\\eta t} \n\\langle[e^{iHt}\\Phi_{\\bm q}e^{-iHt},\\Phi_{\\bm q}^+]\\rangle,\n\\label{eq:F16}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $H$ is the Hamiltonian for a homogeneous electron system and $\\Phi_{\\bm q}$ \nis the electron-pair annihilation operator, defined by $\\Phi_{\\bm q}\\,\\equiv \n\\sum_{\\bm p}c_{{\\bm p}+{\\bm q}\\uparrow}c_{-{\\bm p}\\downarrow}$. In terms of the retarded \npairing correlation function $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)$, we can define $T_c$ as \nthe temperature at which $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)$ diverges at ${\\bm q} = {\\bm 0}$ \nin the static limit ($\\omega \\to 0$) with the decrease of $T$. \n\nAs shown schematically in Fig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(a), $Q_{sc}$ is conventionally \ndivided into a sum of terms classified by the number of $\\tilde{J}$s, where \n$\\tilde{J}$, which has already appeared in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2}), is the irreducible \nelectron-electron effective interaction including all vertex corrections. Using \n$\\Pi_{sc}({\\bm q},\\omega)$ the pairing polarization function composed of two \n{\\it full} electron Green's functions including all self-energy corrections, we \ncan express the infinite sum in Fig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(a) in a quite symbolical \nway as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}=-{\\Pi_{sc} \\over 1+{\\tilde J}\\,\\Pi_{sc}}.\n\\label{eq:F17}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThen, the divergence in $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm 0},\\omega \\to 0)$ occurs at the zero of \nthe denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F17}), which provides exactly the same $T_c$ as \nthat obtained through the solution of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2}). \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{fig5.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Pair correlation function $Q_{sc}$ described in terms of using either \n(a) the pairing polarization function $\\Pi_{sc}$ and the irreducible \nelectron-electron effective interaction $\\tilde{J}$ or (b) the noninteracting \npairing polarization function $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ and the effective interaction \n${\\tilde g}$. By the extension of the idea of expanding $Q_{sc}$ with use of \n$\\Pi_{sc,0}$, we show a scheme to express it in terms of Kohn-Sham \norbitals in (c), together with the schematic representation of ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ \nin (d).}\n\\label{fig5_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nNow, instead of using $\\Pi_{sc}$, we shall consider an alternative expansion \nwith use of $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ the pairing polarization function composed of two \n{\\it bare} electron Green's functions. As shown schematically in \nFig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(b), if we introduce the pairing interaction ${\\tilde g}$ \nby the definition of \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\tilde g} \\equiv {\\tilde J}+{1 \\over \\Pi_{sc}}-{1 \\over \\Pi_{sc,0}},\n\\label{eq:F19}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwe can rewrite $Q_{sc}$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F17}) into another exact form as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}=-{\\Pi_{sc,0} \\over 1+{\\tilde g}\\,\\Pi_{sc,0}}.\n\\label{eq:F18}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince we can always calculate $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ easily, the problem of estimating \n$T_c$ is reduced to the evaluation of ${\\tilde g}$ in the limit of $\\omega \\to\n 0$ at ${\\bm q}={\\bm 0}$. Note that ${\\tilde g}$ does not depend strongly on either \n${\\bm q}$ or $\\omega$, in sharp contrast with $\\Pi_{sc,0}^{R}({\\bm q},\\omega)$. \nIn the BCS theory, for example, ${\\tilde g}$ is taken as a constant which \nrepresents a weakly attractive and spatially local interaction working only \nin the vicinity of the Fermi level, given that the phonon energy $\\omega_0$ \nis much smaller than $E_F$. Then the zero of the denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F18}) \nat ${\\bm q}={\\bm 0}$ and $\\omega \\to 0$ provides the well-known BCS formula for $T_c$. \nNote also that the problem of finding the zero of $1+{\\tilde g}\\,\n\\Pi_{sc,0}^R({\\bm 0},\\omega \\to 0)$ is just the same as that of solving the \ngap equation in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2gap0}) with replacing $V({\\bm p}\\!-\\!{\\bm p'},\ni\\omega_p\\!-\\!i\\omega_{p'})$ by ${\\tilde g}$. \n\nIn the case of short $\\xi_0$, we may assume that the essential physics of \nelectron pairing can be captured even if we treat only a small-cluster system, \nas long as the system size is large enough in comparison with $\\xi_0$. Under this \nassumption, we can take the following procedure for determining ${\\tilde g}$: \nFirst, by representing the values for $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ and ${\\tilde g}$ in an \n$N$-site system as $\\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N)}$ and ${\\tilde g}_N$, respectively, we may \nwrite the pairing correlation function for the $N$-site system $Q_{sc}^{(N)}$ as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}^{(N)}=-\\,{\\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N)} \\over 1+{\\tilde g}_N\\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N)}},\n\\label{eq:F20}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nin accordance with Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F18}). In general, the exact bulk value \n${\\tilde g}$ will be obtained by taking the large-$N$ limit of ${\\tilde g}_N$, \nbut expecting that ${\\tilde g}_{N_0}$ with a small positive integer \n$N_0$ (for example, $N_0 \\approx 2$) is already close to ${\\tilde g}$, we may \nestimate ${\\tilde g}$ by the relation of \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\tilde g} = -{1 \\over Q_{sc,0}^{(N_0)}}-{1 \\over \\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N_0)}},\n\\label{eq:F21}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $Q_{sc}^{(N_0)}$ evaluated rigorously, for example, by exact diagonalization. \nOf course, we can determine a better value of ${\\tilde g}$ by checking the \nsaturation behavior of $\\{{\\tilde g}_{N_0}\\}$ with the increase of $N_0$. \n\n\n\\subsection{Interpolation Formula for the Pairing-Interaction Functional}\n\nBased on the knowledge so far obtained, let us speculate an appropriate \nfunctional form for the pairing interaction ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ in SCDFT. \nIt would be natural to expand the electron field operator in terms of the \nKohn-Sham orbitals $\\{|j\\rangle\\}$ in an inhomogeneous electron system, so that \nwe can define the electron-pair operator $\\Phi_j$ as $\\Phi_{j}\\,\\equiv \nc_{j}c_{{j}^*}$ with $|{j}^*\\rangle$ the time-reversed orbital of $|{j}\\rangle$. \nThen, we can introduce the pairing polarization function in terms of $\\Phi_j$ \nand $\\Phi_{j'}^+$. In particular, we can calculate this quantity in the \nnoninteractiong system $\\Pi_{sc,jj'}$ in analogy with $\\Pi_{sc,0}$, as \nschematically introduced in Fig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(c). At the same time, we can \ndefine a quantity ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ as schematically shown in \nFig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(d). \n\nIn the strong-coupling region, we do not expect that this ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ \nexhibits strong dependence on $i\\Omega$, because the Fermi energy, the scale \nfor the electron kinetic energy, must be much smaller than the energy scale \nrepresenting electron-electron interactions. In addition, ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ \ndoes not depend strongly on orbital variables, either, because the pairing \ninteraction should be short-ranged in real space in line with the shortness of \n$\\xi_0$. Thus we may regard ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ as a constant. Then, if we take \n${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}) as ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$, we can easily \nsee that both Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}) and the zero of $1+{\\tilde g}_{jj'}\\,\n\\Pi_{sc,jj'}^R$ provide the same $T_c$. \n\nIn a more general situation of the intermediate-coupling region, however, \n${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ will depend on both $i\\Omega$ and orbital variables. In order \nto treat such a situation and also by paying attention to the weak-coupling \nsituation examined in the previous section, we propose the functional form for \n${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ in exactly the same form as that in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F5a}) with \nreplacing $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ by ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$. Note that this \nfunctional form of ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ is reduced to ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(0)$, if \n${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ does not depend on $\\Omega$, assuring us that \nthe framework in SCDFT with this choice of ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ provides \nthe same $T_c$ as that in the usual Green's-function approach in the \nstrong-coupling region. This means that we can successfully take care of both \nself-energy and vertex corrections beyond the G$_0$W$_0$ approximation by \nupgrading $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ to ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F5a}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Alkali-Doped Fullerides}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Aims of This Subsection}\n\nThe fulleride is a molecular crystal with narrow threefold conduction bands \n(with the band width $W \\approx 0.5$eV) derived from the $t_{1u}$ electronic \nlevels of each C$_{60}$ molecule. With the doping of three alkali atoms per one \nC$_{60}$ molecule, we obtain the half-filled situation in which superconductivity \noccurs with $T_c$ in the range $18-38$K~\\cite{Hebard91,Takabayashi09}and the \nshort coherence length $\\xi_0$ of only a few molecular units. As for the \nmechanism of superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides, phonons are \nwidely believed to play an important role. This belief is based upon a crude \nestimate of $T_c$ in the conventional Eliashberg theory. In fact, analysis of \nvarious experiments with use of this theory has shown that many aspects of \nsuperconductivity in these fullerides are consistent with a picture of $s$-wave \nBCS superconductors with the Cooper pairs driven by the coupling to the \nintramolecular high-frequency phonons in $H_g$ symmetry (with the phonon energy \n$\\omega_0 \\approx 0.2$eV and the nondimensional electron-phonon coupling constant \n$\\lambda \\approx 0.6$ for Rb$_3$C$_{60}$)~\\cite{Gunnarsson97,Ramirez,Gelfand}. \n\nThe above picture, however, seems to be too much simplified and we may raise \nseveral fundamental questions. From a theoretical point of view, one \nof the serious problems is ill foundation to adopt the Eliashberg theory in the \nfullerides due to the importance of vertex corrections~\\cite{Takada93b,vertex}. \nFrom an experimental side, the following four experimental facts have been \nobserved which we cannot easily understand with use of the Eliashberg theory: \n(i) The relation between $T_c$ and the lattice constant $a_0$ changes remarkably \nwhen the crystal structure changes from the face centered cubic (fcc) to simple \ncubic (sc) lattice by the introduction of Na, a smaller ion compared to K, Rb, \nor Cs, as a dopant ion~\\cite{Tanigaki}. (ii) The antiferromagnetic (AF) \ninsulating behavior has been reported in ammoniated K$_3$C$_{60}$, which is \npeculiar in the sense that $s$-wave BCS superconductivity exists in the \nvicinity of an AF phase~\\cite{Iwasa}. A similar problem is also seen in the \nbody-centered cubic A15-structured Cs$_3$C$_{60}$~\\cite{Takabayashi09}. \n(iii) The anomalous $^{13}$C isotope effect on $T_c$ for 50\\% $^{13}$C \nsubstitution has been observed, reflecting the difference between the molecular \nand atomic mixture of $^{12}$C and $^{13}$C atoms~\\cite{Lieber}. (iv) With the \ndeviation of electron number per site $n$ from half-filling, $T_c$ decreases \nrapidly in both sides of the deviation~\\cite{Yildirim}. \n\nAlthough the experiment (i) may be reproduced in the Eliashberg theory with some \njudicious choice of parameters, the rest (ii)-(iv) cannot be explained even \nqualitatively in the theory. In addition, the behavior of $T_c$ as a function \nof $n$ observed in the experiment (iv) cannot be predicted either by those \ntheories proposed so far to account for the copper-oxide high-$T_c$ \nsuperconductivity based on some strong-correlation models, though such models \nmay be favorable for the explanation of the experiment (ii). \n\nA successful theory for the fullerene superconductors should not only reproduce \nthese experiments in a coherent fashion but also clarify the reason why the \neffect of vertex corrections, even if it is large, does not manifest itself \nin many superconducting properties. In quest of such a theory from a somewhat \ngeneral viewpoint, the present author made intensive studies of the \nHubbard-Holstein (HH) model and its extension in the past and successfully \nexplained all the issues (i)-(iv) raised above~\\cite{Takada98,Takada1,Takada2,\nTakada3,Hotta1,Hotta}. In the rest of this subsection, we shall focus on the \nfirst three issues in order to show how nicely the HH model applies to the \nfullerides, as far as $T_c$ is concerned. Then we shall explore a possibility \nto enhance $T_c$ in this class of superconductors by changing the parameters \ninvolved in the model. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{The Hubbard-Holstein Model}\n\nIn a molecular crystal, it is a very good approximation to regard each molecular \nunit as a ``site'' in a lattice. We shall adopt this approximation and describe \nthe electron-phonon system in the alkali-doped fullerides by a model Hamiltonian \n$H$ in site representation in which each site corresponds to each C$_{60}$ \nmolecular unit. Since the conduction band width is narrow, the intermolecular \nhopping integral $t$ must be small, indicating that only the nearest-neighbor \nhopping is relevant in modelling the kinetic energy of the system. Then, it \nwould be appropriate to decompose $H$ into the nearest-neighbor electron-transfer \nterm $H_t$ and the sum of site terms $\\sum_i H_i$ including both the \nelectron-electron and the electron-local phonon interactions. In order to \nfaithfully represent the threefold degenerate $t_{1u}$-conduction bands coupled \nwith eight $H_g$ intramolecular Jahn-Teller (JT) phonons, we would need to \ninclude the $t_{1u} \\otimes H_g$ JT structure in $H_i$, as has often been the \ncase~\\cite{Varma,Manini94a,Manini94b,Gunnarsson03}. In making a detailed study \non the stability of the AF insulating phase, it is known that this feature of \nband multiplicity plays a rather crucial role~\\cite{Gunnarsson00}, but in \ntreating superconductivity itself, the band multiplicity is not considered to \nbe of primary importance~\\cite{Cappelluti05}. Therefore we shall take a simplest \npossible model, namely, the {\\it one-band} HH model to discuss superconductivity \nfrom a more general viewpoint that will be applicable to the whole family of \nfullerene superconductors including not only electron-doped but also hole-doped \nmaterials with different JT structures. \n\nThe concrete form for $H$ in the HH model is given by \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  H = - t \\sum_{ \\langle i,i' \\rangle\\,\\sigma}\n  (c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{i'\\sigma}+{\\rm h.c.})+\\sum_i H_i,\n\\label{HHmodel-1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the site term $H_i$, written as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 35282, "prevtext": "\nWith use of ${\\cal K}_{\\bm p},{\\bm p'}$ thus derived, we can determine $T_c$ as \nan eigenvalue of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F3}), indicating that we have obtained a scheme \nin which $T_c$ is given directly from the microscopic one-electron \ndispersion relation $\\varepsilon_{\\bm p}$ and the effective electron-electron \ninteraction $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$. Because there is no need to separate the \nphonon-mediated attraction from the Coulomb repulsion in $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ \nand the dynamical nature of the interaction is fully taken into account, we \ncan properly treat the physics leading to $\\mu^*$ from first principles with \nuse of this scheme. \n\nThe very definition of the gap function $\\Delta_{\\bm p}$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F4}) \nindicates that $\\Delta_{\\bm p}$ does not correspond to the physical energy gap \nexcept in the weak-coupling limit. Similary, ${\\cal K}_{\\bm p},{\\bm p'}$ is not a \nphysical entity, although $V$ is the physical effective interaction. Both \nquantities are introduced for the mathematical convenience so as to make $T_c$ \ninvariant in transforming Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2}) into Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F3}). The key \npoint here is that we need not solve the full gap equation~(\\ref{eq:F2}) but \nmuch simpler one~(\\ref{eq:F3}) in order to obtain $T_c$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2}). \nOf course, if we want to know the physical gap function rather than \n$\\Delta_{\\bm p}$ to compare with experiment, we need to solve the full gap \nequation, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2}), with $T_c$ determined by Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F3}). \n\nAlthough the spin-singlet pairing has been assumed in the derivation of \nEq.~(\\ref{eq:F3}), no assumption is made on the dependence of the gap function \non angular valuables, so that this gap equation can treat any kind of the \npairing anisotropy in the gap function, indicating that it can be applied to \ns-wave, d-wave, $\\cdots$, and even their mixture like (s+d)-wave superconductors. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[hbtp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6.0cm]{fig1.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Schematic representation of the dynamical effective interaction \n$V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ as inferred from $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$.}\n\\label{fig1_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nNow, let us compare Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F3}) with Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}). Since the KS \norbitals, $j$ and $j'$, can be specified by momenta, ${\\bm p}$ and ${\\bm p'}$, \nrespectively, in a homogeneous system and $\\varepsilon_{j'}=\\varepsilon_{\\bm p'}$, \nwe may regard that these two equations are esssentially the same, suggesting \nthat we may give a concrete functional form for ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ with use of \nenergies of the KS orbitals, $\\varepsilon_j$ and $\\varepsilon_{j'}$, as\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\cal K}_{jj'} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\!{2 \\over \\pi}\\,d\\Omega\\,\n{|\\varepsilon_{j}|+|\\varepsilon_{j'}| \n\\over \\Omega^2+ \n(|\\varepsilon_{j}|+|\\varepsilon_{j'}|)^2}\\,V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)\\,.\n \\label{eq:F5a}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nHere $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ is the dynamical effective interaction working for the \nscattering process from a pair of electrons in $(j,j^*)$ orbitals to another \npair in $(j',{j'}^*)$ orbitals, as schematically shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig1_takada} \n(By $j^*$ we mean the time-reversed KS orbital of $j$.) \nWe should calculate this $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ on the understanding that it must \nbe derived from the first-principles Hamiltonian expanded with use of a \ncomplete set of the KS orbitals as an orthnormal basis. Together with the gap \nequation, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}), and the KS orbitals obtained in the normal \nstate by the conventional DFT-based method, Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F5a}) constitutes a \nbasic framework for a first-principles calculation of $T_c$ for inhomogeneous \nweak-coupling superconductors. \n\n\n\\subsection{Superconductivity in Polar Semiconductors}\n\nIn order to assess the quality of this basic framework in the G$_0$W$_0$ \napproximation for calculating $T_c$ from first principles, we have applied it \nto polar degenerate semiconductors, specifically, the doped SrTiO$_3$ and \ncompared the calculated results with experiments~\\cite{Takada80}. \n\nThis material is an insulator and exhibits ferroelectricity under a uniaxial \nstress of about 0.16GPa along the [100] direction, but it turns into an $n$-type \nsemiconductor by either Nb doping or oxygen deficiency, whereby the conduction \nelectrons are introduced in the 3d band of Ti around the $\\Gamma$ point with the \nband mass of $m^* \\approx 1.8m_e$ ($m_e$: the mass of a free electron). At low \ntemperatures, superconductivity appears and the observed $T_c$ shows interesting \nfeatures; $T_c$ depends strongly on the electron concentration $n$ and it is \noptimized with $T_c \\approx 0.3$K at $n \\approx 10^{20}$cm$^{-3}$. Its dependence \non the pressure is unsual; $T_c$ decreases rather rapidly with hydrostatic \npressures, but it increases with the [100] uniaxial stress, implying that \nthe superconductivity is brought about by the polar-coupling phonons associated \nwith the stress-induced ferroelectric phase transition, \n\nTaking those situations into account, we have assumed that the material is well \nrepresented by a model of the 3D electron-gas system coupled with polar-optical \nphonons in which a concrete form for $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ can be derived in RPA as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nV({\\bm q},i\\Omega)={4\\pi e^2 \\over \\epsilon({\\bm q},i\\Omega)\\,{\\bm q}^2 },\n\\label{eq:F5b}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the dielectric function in the electron-optical phonon system as \n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\epsilon({\\bm q},i\\Omega)=&\\epsilon_{\\infty}+{4\\pi e^2 \\over {\\bm q}^2}\n\\Pi_0({\\bm q},i\\Omega)\n\\nonumber \\\\\n&+\\left [ \\epsilon_0({\\bm q}) - \\epsilon_{\\infty} \\right ]\n{\\omega_t({\\bm q})^2 \\over \\omega_t({\\bm q})^2+\\Omega^2},\n\\label{eq:F5c}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\epsilon({\\bm{q}},i\\Omega)=\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03f5</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc92</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mi/></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex7.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\epsilon_{\\infty}+{4\\pi e^{2}\\over{\\bm{q}}^{2}}\\Pi_{0}({\\bm{q}},i\\Omega)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03f5</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><msup><mi>\ud835\udc92</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a0</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc92</mi><mo>,</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle+\\left[\\epsilon_{0}({\\bm{q}})-\\epsilon_{\\infty}\\right]{\\omega_{t}%&#10;({\\bm{q}})^{2}\\over\\omega_{t}({\\bm{q}})^{2}+\\Omega^{2}},\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03f5</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc92</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03f5</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></msub></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>t</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc92</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mi>t</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udc92</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mo>+</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a9</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac></mstyle></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03486.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\langle i,i' \\rangle$ represents the nearest-neighbor-site pair, \n$c_{i\\sigma}$ the operator to annihilate a spin-$\\sigma$ electron at site $i$, \n$\\mu$ the chemical potential, $n_{i\\sigma} \\equiv c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\nc_{i\\sigma}$, $U$ the on-site (or intramolecular) Coulomb repulsion, \n$\\alpha$ the nondimensional electron-phonon coupling constant which is related \nto the conventional electron-phonon coupling constant $\\lambda$ through \n$\\lambda=\\alpha \\omega_0 /tz$ with $\\omega_0$ the optical-phonon energy and \n$z$ the coordination number, and $a_i$ the operator to annihilate an optical \nphonon at site $i$.\n\nThe characteristic features of the fullerenes can be well captured by an \nappropriate choice of the parameters involved in this Hamiltonian. In fact, \nthe narrowness of the conduction band can be described by the smallness of $t$ \nof the order of 0.1eV. The difference in the crystal structure as well as the \neffect of band multiplicity can be well accounted for by a suitable choice of $z$. \nThe high-frequency intramolecular optical phonons coupled strongly to electrons \ncan be treated by considering the local phonons with the energy $\\omega_0\\, \n(\\approx 0.2$eV) at each site. The short-range Coulomb potential must be \nrelevant in the fullerenes due to the proximity to the AF state and it can be \nincluded by the introduction of $U$. Note that this $U$ is not the \ndirect Coulomb repulsion between electrons on a carbon atom $U_{\\rm atom}$ \nwhich is of the order of 5-10eV. Rather it is the sum of $U_{\\rm atom}$ and \nthe attraction $-U_{\\rm pol}$ due to the electronic polarization effect of 60 \n$\\pi$-electrons in the C$_{60}$ molecule~\\cite{Chakravarty}. Because of a strong \ncancellation between $U_{\\rm atom}$ and $-U_{\\rm pol}$, $U$ is expected to \nbe of the order of 0.1eV, which is about the same magnitude as that for the \nphonon-mediated attraction, $-U_{ph} \\equiv -2\\alpha\\omega_0$. \n\nIntensive studies on the ground state in this system by exact diagonalization \nof small-size clusters have revealed that the half-filled HH model exhibits \ninteresting competition among charge-density-wave (CDW), spin-density-wave (SDW), \nand superconducting states~\\cite{Takada2,Hotta1}. We may summarize the results \nin the following way: (a) If $U-U_{ph}$ is at least smaller than $-t$, the CDW \nstate composed of an array of immobile bipolarons is stabilized. (b) If \n$U-U_{ph}$ is larger than $t$, there appears the SDW state which is nothing but \nthe AF state in this case. (c) Superconductivity appears only in the CDW-SDW \ntransition region where $|U-U_{ph}|$ is less than $t$. In this offset situation \nof $U \\approx U_{ph}$, the state may be regarded as an assembly of nearly free \npolarons and the main effect of the strong electron-phonon vertex corrections \nis found to form a polaron from a bare electron. This implies that the \nEliashberg theory or even the BCS theory is expected to be accurate enough to \ndescribe superconductivity in this system, if it is applied on the basis of the \npolaron picture~\\cite{Takada2,Hotta1,Alexandrov1}. In any case, the intrisic \ncompetition of superconductivity with the AF state in the half-filled HH model \nresolves the issue (ii) raised previously.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.0cm]{fig6.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{$T_c$ as a function of the lattice constant $a_0$ in the\nalkali-doped fullerides and its dependence on the crystal structure.\nThe solid and the broken curves represent our theoretical results, while the \nexperimental results are given by square, triangle, diamond, and circle marks.}\n\\label{fig6_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to address the issue (i), we have applied our framework to calculate \n$T_c$ to the HH model by estimating ${\\tilde g}$ with use of a cluster as small \nas two molecules (i.e., $N_0=2$). We have evaluated the variation of $t$ with \nthe change of the lattice constant $a_0$ by fitting the change in the band width \nobtained by the band-structure calculation for each lattice \nstructure~\\cite{Satpathy,Saito}. More specifically, $t$ is determined by\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nt = t_{\\rm Rb}\\,{d \\over d_{\\rm Rb}}\\,\\exp \\left (-{d-d_{\\rm Rb} \\over \\Delta} \n\\right),\n\\label{t-1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $d=a_0/\\sqrt{2}-6.95$\\AA\\,, $\\Delta=0.55$\\AA\\,, and the corresponding \nparameters, $t_{\\rm Rb}$ and $d_{\\rm Rb}$, for Rb$_3$C$_{60}$. By choosing \n$t_{\\rm Rb}=1.70\\omega_0$ suitable for Rb$_3$C$_{60}$ and the common parameters \nsuch as $U=3.81\\omega_0$, $\\alpha=2$, and $\\omega_0=0.195$eV with reference to \nband-structure calculations and relevant experiments, we obtain the results \nfor $T_c$ as a function of $a_0$, which agrees remarkably well with \nexperiment as clearly demonstrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig6_takada} Note that in our \ncalculation, the difference in $T_c$ between fcc and sc structures arises mainly \nfrom that in the ``effective'' lattice coordination number $z$~\\cite{Gelfand}. \nThis indicates that $z$ is a key to the resolution of the issue (i). Note also \nthat the recent experimental result for Cs$_3$C$_{60}$ under pressure is also \non our theoretical curve, if we estimate an appropriate value of $a_0$ so as \nto reproduce the same volume per one C$_{60}$ molecule for this bcc A15 structure. \n\nThe competing feature between $U_{ph}$ and $U$ is also identified to be \na key to the resolution of the issue (iii)~\\cite{Takada3}. The observed \nanomalous isotope effect cannot be explained by either the phonon or the \nelectronic polarization mechanism alone. It can be reproduced, if both these \nmechanisms are included simultaneously. Namely, we need to consider the change \nin both $\\omega_0$ and $U$ induced by the isotope substitution. The sensitivity \nof $T_c$ to the local change in the Coulomb potential $U$ is due to the \nvery short-range nature of $\\xi_0$ of this superconductivity. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Prospect for Room-Temperature Superconductors}\n\nEncouraged by the success in reproducing $T_c$ for the alkali-doped fullerene \nsuperconductors by the application of our theoretical framework to the HH model \nat half-filling in the nearly offset situation of $U \\approx U_{ph}$, we have \nattempted to explore the optimum value of $T_c$ with the increase of the \nelectron-phonon coupling constant $\\alpha$, whereby $U$ is also increased to \nkeep the offset situation. Examples of the calculated results of $T_c$ are \nplotted in Fig.~\\ref{fig7_takada} As is seen, $T_c$ goes beyond 100K for \n$\\alpha=3$ and it reaches room temperature for $\\alpha=4$. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7.2cm]{fig7.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{$T_c$ as a function of the lattice constant $a_0$. For electron-doped \nC$_{60}$ with $\\alpha=2$, the theoretical curves are drawn, together with the \nexperimental results. We also give the results for both $\\alpha=3$ and $4$ \ncorresponding to (hypothetical) hole-doped C$_{60}$ and doped C$_{36}$.}\n\\label{fig7_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nBy the band-structure calculation~\\cite{Mazin3}, it is known that $\\alpha$ is \nabout three for the hole-doped C$_{60}$ in which hole carriers will be introduced \ninto the $h_u$-valence bands. On the other hand, in the crystal composed of \nC$_{36}$, $\\alpha$ will be about four~\\cite{Cohen}, if the C$_{36}$ solid is \nsuccessfully doped to have an enough number of mobile carriers in the system, \nalthough it seems to be a very difficult task~\\cite{Zettl}. \n\n\n\\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\n\\label{sec_takada.5}\n\nIn this chapter, we have proposed a new functional form for the pairing \ninteraction ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$, a key quantity in the gap equation, \nEq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}), to determine $T_c$ in the density functional theory \nfor superconductors. The functional form is given in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F5a}) \nwith the effective electron-electron interaction $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ replaced \nby ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ defined schematically in \nFig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(d). We have assessed the usefulness of this functional \nform by its applications to both the weak-coupling superconductors like the \nalkali- and alkaline-earth-intercalated graphites and the strong-coupling \nsuperconductors like the alkali-doped fullerides. We have also explored a \npossibility to enhance $T_c$ up to room temperature. \n\nThe proposed functional form has just opened a challenging frontier of the \nresearch on high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Although we need to improve on the \nfunctional form itself by utilizing the information obtained by its application \nto a much wider range of materials, we can think of several ways to make use of \nthis new theoretical tool. For example, we can make a quantitative assessment \nof the effectiveness of each superconducting mechanism, either phononic or \nelectronic, so far proposed by investigating how much $T_c$ is actually enhanced \nwith the introduction of the mechanism. The knowledge accumulated by such \ninvestigations will pave the way to reach a room-temperature superconductor. \n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\nThis work is supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) \n(No. 21540353) from MEXT, Japan. \n\n\n\\begin{references}\n\n\\bibitem{McMillan68} W.

Among various kinds of GICs, special attention has \nbeen paid to the first-stage metal compounds, mainly because superconductivity \nis observed only in this class of GICs, the chemical formula of which is written \nas $M$C$_x$, where $M$ represents either an alkali atom (such as Li, K, Rb, and \nCs) or an alkaline-earth atom (such as Ca, Sr, and Yb) and $x$ is either $2$, \n$6$, or $8$. The crystal structure of $M$C$_x$ is shown in \nFig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(a), in which the metal atom $M$ occupies the same spot \nin the framework of a honeycomb lattice at every $(x/2)$ layers of carbon atoms. \n\nThe first discovery of superconductivity in GICs was made in KC$_8$ with the \nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of 0.15K in 1965~\\cite{Hannay65}. \nIn pursuit of higher $T_c$, various GICs were synthesized, mostly working with \nthe alkali metals and alkali-metal amalgams as intercalants, from the late 1970s \nto the early 1990s~\\cite{Koike78,Kobayashi79,Koike80,Alexander80,Iye,Belash89a,\nDresselhaus89,Belash90}, but only a limited success was achieved at that time; \nthe highest attained $T_c$ was around 2-5K in the last century. For example, \nit is 1.9K in LiC$_2$~\\cite{Belash89b}. \n\nA breakthough occurred in 2005 when $T_c$ went up to 11.5K in CaC$_6$~\\cite{CaC6,\nEmery} (and even to 15.4K under pressures up to 7.5GPa~\\cite{Takagi}). In other \nalkaline-earth GICs, the values of $T_c$ are 6.5K and 1.65K for \nYbC$_6$~\\cite{CaC6} and SrC$_6$~\\cite{Kim2}, respectively. Since then, \nvery intensive experimental studies have been made in those and related \ncompounds~\\cite{Emery,Kim2,Kim1,Kurter}. Theoretical studies have also been \nperformed mainly by making state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of \nthe electron-phonon coupling constant $\\lambda$ to account for the observed \nvalue of $T_c$ for each individual superconductor~\\cite{Mazin,Csanyi,Mauri,\nSanna07}. Those experimental/theoretical works have elucidated that, although \nthere are some anisotropic features in the superconducting gap, the conventional \nphonon-driven mechanism to bring about s-wave superconductivity applies to those \ncompounds. This picture of superconductivity is confirmed by, for example, the \nobservation of the Ca isotope effect with its exponent $\\alpha=0.50$, the \ntypical BCS value~\\cite{Hinks}. \n\nIn spite of all those efforts and the existence of such a generally accepted \npicture, we need to know more important and fundamental issues that include: \n\n\\noindent\n(i) Standard model: Can we understand the mechanism of superconductivity in \nboth alkali GICs with $T_c$ in the range $0.01-1.0$K and alkaline-earth GICs \nwith $T_c$ in the range $1-10$K from a unified point of view? In other words, \nis there any standard model for superconductivity in GICs with $T_c$ ranging \nover three orders of magnitude? \n\n\\noindent\n(ii) Key parameters to control $T_c$: What is the actual reason why $T_c$ is \nenhanced so abruptly (or by about a hundred times) by just substituting K by Ca \nthe atomic mass of which is almost the same as that of K? In terms of the \nstandard model, what are the key controlling physical parameters to bring about \nthis huge enhancement of $T_c$? This change of $T_c$ from KC$_8$ to CaC$_6$ is \nprobably the most important issue in exploring superconductivity across the \nentire family of GICs. \n\n\\noindent\n(iii) Optimum $T_c$: Is there any possibility to make a further enhancement of \n$T_c$ in GICs? If possible, what is the optimum value of $T_c$ expected in the \nstandard model and what kind of atoms should be intercalated to realize the \noptimum $T_c$ in actual GICs? \n\nRecently these three issues have been satisfactorily addressed by the present \nauthor~\\cite{Takada09a,Takada09b}, as shall be explained one by one in the \nfollowing three subsections. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.0cm]{fig3.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{(a) Crystal structure of $M$C$_x$\\ ($x$=$2,\\,6,\\,8$). The case of $x$\n=$6$ is illustrated here, in which the metal atoms, $M$s, are arranged in a rhombohedral \nstructure with the $\\alpha \\beta \\gamma$ stacking sequence, implying that \n$M$ occupies the same spot in the framework of a graphene lattice at every \nthree layers (or at the distance of $3d$ with $d$ the distance between the \nadjacent graphite layers). \n(b) Simplified model to represent $M$C$_x$ superconductors. \nWe consider the attraction between the 3D electrons in the interlayer band \ninduced by polar-coupled charge fluctuations of the cation $M^{Z+}$ and \nthe anion C$^{-\\delta}$. \n(c) Superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in the first-stage alkali- \nand alkaline-earth-intercalated graphites plotted as a function of $d$. \nThe solid circles show the experimental results, while the crosses the \ncalculated ones in the G$_0$W$_0$ approximation for the model represented \nin (b) with suitable values for the parameters such as $Z$, $m^*$, and $f$ \nfor each $M$C$_x$.}\n\\label{fig3_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Standard Model for Intercalated Graphite Superconductors}\n\nThe usual DFT-based self-consistent band-structure calculation is useful in \nelucidating the electronic structures of GICs in the normal state, basically \nbecause GICs are not strongly-correlated materials. According to such a \ncalculation, no essential qualitative difference is found between alkali and \nalkaline-earth GICs. The main common features among these GICs may be \nsummarized as follows: \n\nFirst of all, each intercalant metal atom in $M$C$_x$ acts as a donor and \nchanges from a neutral atom $M$ to an ion $M^{Z+}$ with valence $Z$. Then, \nthe valence electrons released from $M$ will transfer either to the graphite \n$\\pi$ bands or the three-dimensional (3D) band composed of the intercalant \norbitals and the graphite interlayer states~\\cite{Posternak84,Holzwarth84,\nKoma86}. We shall define the factor $f$ as the branching ratio between these \ntwo kinds of bands. Namely, $Zf$ and $Z(1-f)$ electrons will go to the $\\pi$ \nand the 3D bands, respectively. The electrons in the graphite $\\pi$ bands are \ncharacterized by the two-dimensional (2D) motion with a linear dispersion \nrelation (known as a Dirac cone in the case of graphene) on the graphite layer. \n\nThe dispersion relation of the graphite interlayer band is very similar to \nthat of the 3D free-electron gas, folded into the Brillouin zone of the \ngraphite~\\cite{Csanyi}. Thus its energy level is very high above the Fermi \nlevel in the graphite, because the amplitude of the wavefunction for this band \nis small on the carbon atoms. In $M$C$_x$, on the other hand, the cation \n$M^{Z+}$ is located in the interlayer position where the amplitude of the \nwavefunctions is large, lowering the energy level of the interlayer band \nbelow the Fermi level. The dispersion of the interlayer band is modified \nfrom that of the free-electron gas because of the hybridization with the \norbitals associated with $M$, but generally it is well approximated by \n$\\varepsilon_{\\bm p}={\\bm p}^2/2m^*-E_{\\rm F}$ with an appropriate choice of \nthe effective band mass $m^*$ and the Fermi energy $E_{\\rm F}$. Here the value \nof $m^*$ depends on $M$; in alkali GICs, the hybridization occurs with \ns-orbitals, allowing us to consider that $m^*=m_e$, while in alkaline-earth \nGICs, the hybridization with d-orbitals conrtibutes much, leading to \n$m^* \\approx 3m_e$ in both CaC$_6$ and YbC$_6$, as revealed by \nthe band-structure calculation~\\cite{Mazin,Mauri}. \n\nThe value of $f$, which determins the branching ratio $Zf:Z(1-f)$, can be \nobtained by the self-consistent band-structure calculation. In KC$_8$, for \nexample, it is known that $f$ is around $0.6$~\\cite{Ohno79,Wang91}. On the \nother hand, $f$ is about $0.16$ in CaC$_6$, making the electron density in \nthe 3D band $n$ increase very much~\\cite{Mauri}. This increase in $n$ is \neasily understood by the fact that the energy level of the interlayer band \nis much lower with Ca$^{2+}$ than with K$^+$. The concrete numbers for \n$n$ are $3.5 \\times 10^{21}$cm$^{-3}$ and $2.4 \\times 10^{22}$cm$^{-3}$ \nfor KC$_8$ and CaC$_6$, respectively, in which the difference in both $d$ and \n$x$ is also taking into account. \n\nAs inferred from experiments~\\cite{PhysToday2,Csanyi} and also from \nthe comparison of $T_c$ calculated for each band~\\cite{Takada82}, \nit has been concluded that only the 3D interlayer band is responsible for \nsuperconductivity. Note that LiC$_6$ does not exhibit superconductivity \nbecause no carriers are present in the 3D interlayer band, although the \nproperties of LiC$_6$ are generally very similar to those of other \nsuperconducting GICs in the normal state. \n\nWith the above-mentioned common features in mind, we can think of a simple \nmodel of a 3D electron gas coupled with phonons for the GIC superconductors, \nwhich is schematically shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(b). In order to give \nsome idea about the mechanism to induce an attraction between 3D electrons in \nthis model, let us imagine how each conducting 3D electron sees the charge \ndistribution of the system. First of all, there are posively charged metallic \nions $M^{Z+}$ with its density $n_M$, given by $n_M=4/3\\sqrt{3}\\,a^2dx$, where \n$a$ is the bond length between C atoms on the graphite layer (which is \n1.419\\AA). Note that with use of this $n_M$, the density of the 3D electrons \n$n$ is given by $(1-f)Zn_M$. There are also negatively charged carbon ions \nC$^{-\\delta}$ with $\\delta$ given by $\\delta=fZ/x$ on the average. Therefore \nthe 3D electrons will feel a large electric field of the polarization wave \ncoming from oscillations of $M^{Z+}$ and C$^{-\\delta}$ ions created by either \nout-of-phase optical or in-phase acoustic phonons. \n\nAlthough there are some additional complications originating from the combined \ncontributions from both optical and acoustic modes in the layered-lattice \nsystem, this coupling of an electron with the polar phonons is essentially \nsimilar to the one we have already considered in the previous subsection. Thus \nit is straightforward to derive the effective interaction $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ \nin RPA in which the bare Coulomb repulsion and the polar-phonon-mediated \nattraction are treated on the same footing with the screening effects of both \nthe 2D and 3D electrons. A concrete form for $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ will not be \ngiven here, but for its detailed derivation we refer to the original \npaper~\\cite{Takada82} in which exactly the same model as presented in \nFig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(b) was proposed in as early as 1982 by the present \nauthor for analyzing superconductivity in alkali GICs. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Key Physical Parameters to Control Superconductivity}\n\nWe have evaluated $T_c$ from first principles by using $V({\\bm q},i\\Omega)$ \nthus obtained to solve the gap equation~(\\ref{eq:F3}). \nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig3_takada}(c), the calculated results of $T_c$ for various \n$M$C$_x$ are plotted by the crosses with the choice of suitable values for \nthe parameters such as $Z$, $m^*$, and $f$ for each material. As we see, the \nagreement between theory and experiment is quite excellent across the \nentire family of GICs, implying that our simple model may well be regarded as \nthe standard one for describing the mechanism of superconductivity in GICs. \n\nIn order to identify the controlling physical parameters to enhance $T_c$ \nin CaC$_6$ by a handred times from that in KC$_8$, let us compare the \nvalues for the physical parameters between the two materials: \n(i) The valence $Z$; because the valence changes from monvalence to divalence, \nthe value of $Z$ in CaC$_6$ is doubled to make the bare polar-phonon-mediated \nattraction (which is in proportion to $Z^2$) stronger by four times. \n(ii) The interlayer distance $d$; it decreases from $5.42$\\AA\\ to $4.524$\\AA, \nso that the 3D electron density $n$ increases in CaC$_6$. \n(iii) The factor $f$ to determine the branching ratio; it decreases from \nabout $0.6$ to $0.16$, which also makes a further increase in $n$. \n(iv) The effective band mass for the 3D interlayer band $m^*$; it increases \nfrom $m_e$ to about $3m_e$, leading to a large enhancement of the density \nof states at the Fermi level.\n(v) The atomic number of the ion $A$; it changes only from $39.1$ in K \nto $40.1$ in Ca. Thus the energies of phonons hardly change. \n\nWe have recalculated $T_c$ by shifting each parameter, one by one, from the \nabove-mentioned respective physical value and have found that two parameters, \nnamely, $Z$ and $m^*$, are very important in controlling the overall magnitude \nof $T_c$. In fact, $T_c$ is enhanced by one order of magnitude from that in \nKC$_8$ by doubling $Z$ from $Z=1$ to $Z=2$ with $m^*$ kept to be $m_e$. \nA further enhancement of $T_c$ by another one order is seen by tripling $m^*$ \nfrom $m_e$ to $3m_e$, with $Z$ kept to be $Z=2$. Thus we may conclude that the \nenhancement of $T_c$ in CaC$_6$ by about a hundred times from that in KC$_8$ is \nbrought about by the combined effects of doubling $Z$ and tripling $m^*$. In \nthis respect, the actual value of $m^*$ is very important. Appropriateness of \n$m^* \\approx 3m_e$ is confirmed not only from the band-structure \ncalculations~\\cite{Mazin,Mauri} but also from the measurement of the electronic \nspecfic heat~\\cite{Kim1} compared with the corresponding one for \nKC$_8$~\\cite{Mizutani78}.\n\nA note will be added here on the case of YbC$_6$; the basic parameters such \nas $Z$, $f$, and $m^*$ for YbC$_6$ are about the same as those for CaC$_6$, \naccording to the band-structure calculation. The only big difference can be seen \nin the atomic mass; Yb (in which $A=173.0$) is much heavier than that of Ca \nby about four times, indicating weaker couplings between electrons and polar \nphonons as just in the case of comparison between KC$_8$ and RbC$_8$ or CsC$_8$. \nIn fact, $T_c$ for YbC$_6$ becomes about one half of the corresponding result for \nCaC$_6$, which agrees well with experiment. One way to understand this difference \nis to regard it as an isotope effect with $\\alpha \\approx 0.5$~\\cite{Mazin}. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Prediction of Optimum $T_c$}\n\\label{sec:8}\n\nAs we have seen so far, our standard model could have predicted $T_c =11.5$K \nfor CaC$_6$ in 1982 and it is judged that its predictive power is very high. \nIncidentally, the author did not perform the calculation of $T_c$ for \nCaC$_6$ at that time, partly because he did not know a possibility to synthesize \nsuch GICs, but mostly because the calculation cost was extremely high in \nthose days; a rough estimate shows that there is acceleration in computers by \nat least a millon times in the past three decades. This huge improvement \non computational environments is surely a boost to making such a first-principles \ncalculation of $T_c$ in the G$_0$W$_0$ approximation. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6.0cm]{fig4.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Prediction of $T_c$ as a function of $m^*$ for various \nGICs in pursuit of optimum $T_c$. We assume the fractional factor $f=0$.}\n\\label{fig4_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe have explored the optimum $T_c$ in the whole family of GICs by widely \nchanging various parameters involved in the microscopic Hamiltonian of \nthe standard model. Examples of the calculated results of $T_c$ are shown in \nFig.~\\ref{fig4_takada}, in which $f$ is fixed to zero, the optimum \ncondition to raise $T_c$, and $d$ is tentatively taken as 4.0\\AA. From this \nexploration, we find that the most \nimportant parameter to enhance $T_c$ is $m^*$. In particular, we need $m^*$ \nlarger than at least $2m_e$ to obtain $T_c$ over 10K, irrespective of any \nchoice of other parameters, and $T_c$ is optimized for $m^*$ in the range \n$(10-20)m_e$. The optimized $T_c$ depends rather strongly on the parameters to \ncontrol the polar-coupling strength such as $Z$ and the atomic mass $A$; if we \nchoose a trivalent light atom such as boron to make $\\omega_t(0)$ large, the \noptimum $T_c$ is about 100K, but the problem about the light atoms is that $m^*$ \nwill never become heavy due to the absence of either d or f electrons. Therefore \nwe do not expect that $T_c$ would become much larger than 10K, even if BeC$_2$ or \nBC$_2$ were synthesized. From this perspective, it will be much better to \nintercalate Ti or V, rather than Be or B. Taking all these points into account, \nwe suggest synthesizing three-element GICs providing a heavy 3D electron system \nby the introduction of heavy atoms into a light-atom polar-crystal environment. \n\n\n\n\\section{Strong-Coupling Approach with Application to Fullerides}\n\\label{sec_takada.4}\n\n\n\\subsection{Coherence Length}\n\nIn the BCS theory for superconductivity which is applicable to superconductors \nin the weak-coupling region, $T_c$ is directly related to the coherence length \n$\\xi_0$ which characterizes the spatial extent of the wave function representing \nthe bound state of a Cooper pair at zero temperature. More concretely, the \nrelation between them is expressed as $T_c/E_F = 2e^{\\gamma}/\\pi^2 (p_F\\xi_0)^{-1} \n\\approx 0.361/p_F\\xi_0$ with $\\gamma\\,(=0.57721\\cdots)$ the Euler-Mascheroni \nconstant and $p_F$ the Fermi wave number. Because $p_F^{-1}$ is in proportion \nto the lattice constant $a_0$, the relation is rewritten into the form as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{T_c \\over E_F} \\ \\approx \\ 0.0735\\,{a_0 \\over \\xi_0}\n\\label{eq:F15}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nfor a monovalent metal in the fcc-lattice structure. (For other valence and/or \ncrystal structure, the coefficient of 0.0735 changes, but it always remains in \nthe same order of magnitude.) For usual elemental superconductors, $T_c/E_F$ is \nof the order of $10^{-4}$ and thus $\\xi_0$ is about a thousand times larger than \n$a_0$, validating the approach in momentum space. On the other hand, the relation \nin Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F15}) implies that high $T_c$ is inevitably associated with short \n$\\xi_0$. In fact, $\\xi_0$ is observed as only a few nm or less, i.e., of the \nsame order of $a_0$ in many of the recently synthesized high-$T_c$ \nsuperconductors~\\cite{Text} such as the cuprates, the alkali-doped C$_{60}$, \nand MgB$_2$. \n\nA similar message can be obtained through the so-called Uemura \nplot~\\cite{Uemura91a,Uemura91b,Takada92}, according to which there is a universal \nrelation of $T_c/E_F \\approx 0.04$ for a wide variety of strong-coupling \nsuperconductors. If this relation is put into Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F15}), we obtain \n$\\xi_0 \\approx 2\\,a_0$. Furthermore, if we think of the Bose-Einstein \ncondensation (BEC) for an assembly of very tightly-bound pairs of electrons, \nthe condensation temperature (which amounts to $T_c$ in such a system) is given \nby $T_c/E_F=(2/9\\pi\\, \\zeta(3/2)^2)^{1/3}\\approx 0.218$, where $\\zeta(3/2)\\,\n(=2.6124\\cdots)$ is the Riemann's zeta function $\\zeta(x)$ at $x=3/2$. This \nvalue of $T_c/E_F$ (which must be the optimum value for fermionic superconductors) \nsuggests $\\xi_0 \\approx 0.3\\,a_0$. Thus, in treating superconductivity in the \nstrong-coupling region, we need to consider a situation of extremely short $\\xi_0$, \nvalidating the approach in real space, which is totally different from that of \nvery long $\\xi_0$ in the weak-coupling superconductors. \n\n\n\\subsection{Pairing Interaction in the Strong-Coupling Region}\n\nIn view of the above-mentioned difference in $\\xi_0$, we shall exploit the \nshortness of $\\xi_0$ in reformulating the problem of making a quantitative \ncalculation of $T_c$ for strong-coupling superconductors in the Green's-function \napproach~\\cite{Takada07}. Let us start with this reformulation by considering \nthe dynamical correlation function for singlet pairing of two electrons in the \nnormal state $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)$, which is defined as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)=-i \\int_0^{\\infty}dt\\,e^{i\\omega t -\\eta t} \n\\langle[e^{iHt}\\Phi_{\\bm q}e^{-iHt},\\Phi_{\\bm q}^+]\\rangle,\n\\label{eq:F16}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $H$ is the Hamiltonian for a homogeneous electron system and $\\Phi_{\\bm q}$ \nis the electron-pair annihilation operator, defined by $\\Phi_{\\bm q}\\,\\equiv \n\\sum_{\\bm p}c_{{\\bm p}+{\\bm q}\\uparrow}c_{-{\\bm p}\\downarrow}$. In terms of the retarded \npairing correlation function $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)$, we can define $T_c$ as \nthe temperature at which $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm q},\\omega)$ diverges at ${\\bm q} = {\\bm 0}$ \nin the static limit ($\\omega \\to 0$) with the decrease of $T$. \n\nAs shown schematically in Fig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(a), $Q_{sc}$ is conventionally \ndivided into a sum of terms classified by the number of $\\tilde{J}$s, where \n$\\tilde{J}$, which has already appeared in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2}), is the irreducible \nelectron-electron effective interaction including all vertex corrections. Using \n$\\Pi_{sc}({\\bm q},\\omega)$ the pairing polarization function composed of two \n{\\it full} electron Green's functions including all self-energy corrections, we \ncan express the infinite sum in Fig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(a) in a quite symbolical \nway as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}=-{\\Pi_{sc} \\over 1+{\\tilde J}\\,\\Pi_{sc}}.\n\\label{eq:F17}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThen, the divergence in $Q_{sc}^R({\\bm 0},\\omega \\to 0)$ occurs at the zero of \nthe denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F17}), which provides exactly the same $T_c$ as \nthat obtained through the solution of Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2}). \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=6.5cm]{fig5.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Pair correlation function $Q_{sc}$ described in terms of using either \n(a) the pairing polarization function $\\Pi_{sc}$ and the irreducible \nelectron-electron effective interaction $\\tilde{J}$ or (b) the noninteracting \npairing polarization function $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ and the effective interaction \n${\\tilde g}$. By the extension of the idea of expanding $Q_{sc}$ with use of \n$\\Pi_{sc,0}$, we show a scheme to express it in terms of Kohn-Sham \norbitals in (c), together with the schematic representation of ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ \nin (d).}\n\\label{fig5_takada}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nNow, instead of using $\\Pi_{sc}$, we shall consider an alternative expansion \nwith use of $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ the pairing polarization function composed of two \n{\\it bare} electron Green's functions. As shown schematically in \nFig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(b), if we introduce the pairing interaction ${\\tilde g}$ \nby the definition of \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\tilde g} \\equiv {\\tilde J}+{1 \\over \\Pi_{sc}}-{1 \\over \\Pi_{sc,0}},\n\\label{eq:F19}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwe can rewrite $Q_{sc}$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F17}) into another exact form as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}=-{\\Pi_{sc,0} \\over 1+{\\tilde g}\\,\\Pi_{sc,0}}.\n\\label{eq:F18}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nSince we can always calculate $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ easily, the problem of estimating \n$T_c$ is reduced to the evaluation of ${\\tilde g}$ in the limit of $\\omega \\to\n 0$ at ${\\bm q}={\\bm 0}$. Note that ${\\tilde g}$ does not depend strongly on either \n${\\bm q}$ or $\\omega$, in sharp contrast with $\\Pi_{sc,0}^{R}({\\bm q},\\omega)$. \nIn the BCS theory, for example, ${\\tilde g}$ is taken as a constant which \nrepresents a weakly attractive and spatially local interaction working only \nin the vicinity of the Fermi level, given that the phonon energy $\\omega_0$ \nis much smaller than $E_F$. Then the zero of the denominator in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F18}) \nat ${\\bm q}={\\bm 0}$ and $\\omega \\to 0$ provides the well-known BCS formula for $T_c$. \nNote also that the problem of finding the zero of $1+{\\tilde g}\\,\n\\Pi_{sc,0}^R({\\bm 0},\\omega \\to 0)$ is just the same as that of solving the \ngap equation in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F2gap0}) with replacing $V({\\bm p}\\!-\\!{\\bm p'},\ni\\omega_p\\!-\\!i\\omega_{p'})$ by ${\\tilde g}$. \n\nIn the case of short $\\xi_0$, we may assume that the essential physics of \nelectron pairing can be captured even if we treat only a small-cluster system, \nas long as the system size is large enough in comparison with $\\xi_0$. Under this \nassumption, we can take the following procedure for determining ${\\tilde g}$: \nFirst, by representing the values for $\\Pi_{sc,0}$ and ${\\tilde g}$ in an \n$N$-site system as $\\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N)}$ and ${\\tilde g}_N$, respectively, we may \nwrite the pairing correlation function for the $N$-site system $Q_{sc}^{(N)}$ as \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nQ_{sc}^{(N)}=-\\,{\\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N)} \\over 1+{\\tilde g}_N\\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N)}},\n\\label{eq:F20}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nin accordance with Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F18}). In general, the exact bulk value \n${\\tilde g}$ will be obtained by taking the large-$N$ limit of ${\\tilde g}_N$, \nbut expecting that ${\\tilde g}_{N_0}$ with a small positive integer \n$N_0$ (for example, $N_0 \\approx 2$) is already close to ${\\tilde g}$, we may \nestimate ${\\tilde g}$ by the relation of \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n{\\tilde g} = -{1 \\over Q_{sc,0}^{(N_0)}}-{1 \\over \\Pi_{sc,0}^{(N_0)}},\n\\label{eq:F21}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith $Q_{sc}^{(N_0)}$ evaluated rigorously, for example, by exact diagonalization. \nOf course, we can determine a better value of ${\\tilde g}$ by checking the \nsaturation behavior of $\\{{\\tilde g}_{N_0}\\}$ with the increase of $N_0$. \n\n\n\\subsection{Interpolation Formula for the Pairing-Interaction Functional}\n\nBased on the knowledge so far obtained, let us speculate an appropriate \nfunctional form for the pairing interaction ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ in SCDFT. \nIt would be natural to expand the electron field operator in terms of the \nKohn-Sham orbitals $\\{|j\\rangle\\}$ in an inhomogeneous electron system, so that \nwe can define the electron-pair operator $\\Phi_j$ as $\\Phi_{j}\\,\\equiv \nc_{j}c_{{j}^*}$ with $|{j}^*\\rangle$ the time-reversed orbital of $|{j}\\rangle$. \nThen, we can introduce the pairing polarization function in terms of $\\Phi_j$ \nand $\\Phi_{j'}^+$. In particular, we can calculate this quantity in the \nnoninteractiong system $\\Pi_{sc,jj'}$ in analogy with $\\Pi_{sc,0}$, as \nschematically introduced in Fig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(c). At the same time, we can \ndefine a quantity ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ as schematically shown in \nFig.~\\ref{fig5_takada}(d). \n\nIn the strong-coupling region, we do not expect that this ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ \nexhibits strong dependence on $i\\Omega$, because the Fermi energy, the scale \nfor the electron kinetic energy, must be much smaller than the energy scale \nrepresenting electron-electron interactions. In addition, ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ \ndoes not depend strongly on orbital variables, either, because the pairing \ninteraction should be short-ranged in real space in line with the shortness of \n$\\xi_0$. Thus we may regard ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ as a constant. Then, if we take \n${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}) as ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$, we can easily \nsee that both Eq.~(\\ref{eq:SCDFT}) and the zero of $1+{\\tilde g}_{jj'}\\,\n\\Pi_{sc,jj'}^R$ provide the same $T_c$. \n\nIn a more general situation of the intermediate-coupling region, however, \n${\\tilde g}_{jj'}$ will depend on both $i\\Omega$ and orbital variables. In order \nto treat such a situation and also by paying attention to the weak-coupling \nsituation examined in the previous section, we propose the functional form for \n${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ in exactly the same form as that in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F5a}) with \nreplacing $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ by ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$. Note that this \nfunctional form of ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ is reduced to ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(0)$, if \n${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ does not depend on $\\Omega$, assuring us that \nthe framework in SCDFT with this choice of ${\\cal K}_{jj'}$ provides \nthe same $T_c$ as that in the usual Green's-function approach in the \nstrong-coupling region. This means that we can successfully take care of both \nself-energy and vertex corrections beyond the G$_0$W$_0$ approximation by \nupgrading $V_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ to ${\\tilde g}_{jj'}(i\\Omega)$ in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:F5a}).\n\n\n\\subsection{Alkali-Doped Fullerides}\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Aims of This Subsection}\n\nThe fulleride is a molecular crystal with narrow threefold conduction bands \n(with the band width $W \\approx 0.5$eV) derived from the $t_{1u}$ electronic \nlevels of each C$_{60}$ molecule. With the doping of three alkali atoms per one \nC$_{60}$ molecule, we obtain the half-filled situation in which superconductivity \noccurs with $T_c$ in the range $18-38$K~\\cite{Hebard91,Takabayashi09}and the \nshort coherence length $\\xi_0$ of only a few molecular units. As for the \nmechanism of superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides, phonons are \nwidely believed to play an important role. This belief is based upon a crude \nestimate of $T_c$ in the conventional Eliashberg theory. In fact, analysis of \nvarious experiments with use of this theory has shown that many aspects of \nsuperconductivity in these fullerides are consistent with a picture of $s$-wave \nBCS superconductors with the Cooper pairs driven by the coupling to the \nintramolecular high-frequency phonons in $H_g$ symmetry (with the phonon energy \n$\\omega_0 \\approx 0.2$eV and the nondimensional electron-phonon coupling constant \n$\\lambda \\approx 0.6$ for Rb$_3$C$_{60}$)~\\cite{Gunnarsson97,Ramirez,Gelfand}. \n\nThe above picture, however, seems to be too much simplified and we may raise \nseveral fundamental questions. From a theoretical point of view, one \nof the serious problems is ill foundation to adopt the Eliashberg theory in the \nfullerides due to the importance of vertex corrections~\\cite{Takada93b,vertex}. \nFrom an experimental side, the following four experimental facts have been \nobserved which we cannot easily understand with use of the Eliashberg theory: \n(i) The relation between $T_c$ and the lattice constant $a_0$ changes remarkably \nwhen the crystal structure changes from the face centered cubic (fcc) to simple \ncubic (sc) lattice by the introduction of Na, a smaller ion compared to K, Rb, \nor Cs, as a dopant ion~\\cite{Tanigaki}. (ii) The antiferromagnetic (AF) \ninsulating behavior has been reported in ammoniated K$_3$C$_{60}$, which is \npeculiar in the sense that $s$-wave BCS superconductivity exists in the \nvicinity of an AF phase~\\cite{Iwasa}. A similar problem is also seen in the \nbody-centered cubic A15-structured Cs$_3$C$_{60}$~\\cite{Takabayashi09}. \n(iii) The anomalous $^{13}$C isotope effect on $T_c$ for 50\\% $^{13}$C \nsubstitution has been observed, reflecting the difference between the molecular \nand atomic mixture of $^{12}$C and $^{13}$C atoms~\\cite{Lieber}. (iv) With the \ndeviation of electron number per site $n$ from half-filling, $T_c$ decreases \nrapidly in both sides of the deviation~\\cite{Yildirim}. \n\nAlthough the experiment (i) may be reproduced in the Eliashberg theory with some \njudicious choice of parameters, the rest (ii)-(iv) cannot be explained even \nqualitatively in the theory. In addition, the behavior of $T_c$ as a function \nof $n$ observed in the experiment (iv) cannot be predicted either by those \ntheories proposed so far to account for the copper-oxide high-$T_c$ \nsuperconductivity based on some strong-correlation models, though such models \nmay be favorable for the explanation of the experiment (ii). \n\nA successful theory for the fullerene superconductors should not only reproduce \nthese experiments in a coherent fashion but also clarify the reason why the \neffect of vertex corrections, even if it is large, does not manifest itself \nin many superconducting properties. In quest of such a theory from a somewhat \ngeneral viewpoint, the present author made intensive studies of the \nHubbard-Holstein (HH) model and its extension in the past and successfully \nexplained all the issues (i)-(iv) raised above~\\cite{Takada98,Takada1,Takada2,\nTakada3,Hotta1,Hotta}. In the rest of this subsection, we shall focus on the \nfirst three issues in order to show how nicely the HH model applies to the \nfullerides, as far as $T_c$ is concerned. Then we shall explore a possibility \nto enhance $T_c$ in this class of superconductors by changing the parameters \ninvolved in the model. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{The Hubbard-Holstein Model}\n\nIn a molecular crystal, it is a very good approximation to regard each molecular \nunit as a ``site'' in a lattice. We shall adopt this approximation and describe \nthe electron-phonon system in the alkali-doped fullerides by a model Hamiltonian \n$H$ in site representation in which each site corresponds to each C$_{60}$ \nmolecular unit. Since the conduction band width is narrow, the intermolecular \nhopping integral $t$ must be small, indicating that only the nearest-neighbor \nhopping is relevant in modelling the kinetic energy of the system. Then, it \nwould be appropriate to decompose $H$ into the nearest-neighbor electron-transfer \nterm $H_t$ and the sum of site terms $\\sum_i H_i$ including both the \nelectron-electron and the electron-local phonon interactions. In order to \nfaithfully represent the threefold degenerate $t_{1u}$-conduction bands coupled \nwith eight $H_g$ intramolecular Jahn-Teller (JT) phonons, we would need to \ninclude the $t_{1u} \\otimes H_g$ JT structure in $H_i$, as has often been the \ncase~\\cite{Varma,Manini94a,Manini94b,Gunnarsson03}. In making a detailed study \non the stability of the AF insulating phase, it is known that this feature of \nband multiplicity plays a rather crucial role~\\cite{Gunnarsson00}, but in \ntreating superconductivity itself, the band multiplicity is not considered to \nbe of primary importance~\\cite{Cappelluti05}. Therefore we shall take a simplest \npossible model, namely, the {\\it one-band} HH model to discuss superconductivity \nfrom a more general viewpoint that will be applicable to the whole family of \nfullerene superconductors including not only electron-doped but also hole-doped \nmaterials with different JT structures. \n\nThe concrete form for $H$ in the HH model is given by \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n  H = - t \\sum_{ \\langle i,i' \\rangle\\,\\sigma}\n  (c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{i'\\sigma}+{\\rm h.c.})+\\sum_i H_i,\n\\label{HHmodel-1}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith the site term $H_i$, written as\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{align}\nH_i&=   - \\mu \\sum_{\\sigma} n_{i\\sigma} + U\\, n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}\n\\nonumber \\\\\n&+\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\omega_0 \\sum_{\\sigma}n_{i\\sigma}(a_i+a_i^{\\dagger})\n+\\omega_0\\, a_i^{\\dagger}a_i,\n\\label{HHmodel-2}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex8.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle H_{i}\" display=\"inline\"><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.Ex8.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=-\\mu\\sum_{\\sigma}n_{i\\sigma}+U\\,n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></munder></mstyle><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>U</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2191</mo><mi/></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2193</mo><mi/></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle+\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\omega_{0}\\sum_{\\sigma}n_{i\\sigma}(a_{i}+a_{i}^{%&#10;\\dagger})+\\omega_{0}\\,a_{i}^{\\dagger}a_{i},\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><msqrt><mi>\u03b1</mi></msqrt><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></munder></mstyle><mrow><msub><mi>n</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2020</mo></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msub><mi>\u03c9</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2020</mo></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>a</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
