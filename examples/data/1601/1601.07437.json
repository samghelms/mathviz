At ultrarelativistic beam energies the interaction of the initial nuclei excites the vacuum and high energies are deposited in the reaction zone, creating a very hot medium of vanishing net-baryon density. At lower beam energies the incoming baryon currents are stopped and the medium is less hot but more dense than at highest beam energies. In these extreme regimes it is expected that a new state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma of colored partonic degrees of freedom is created. The success of models like statistical hadronization \\cite{Andronic:2011yq} and of fluid dynamical simulations \\cite{Song:2010mg,Schenke:2010rr,Gale:2012rq} in comparison to a variety of experimental data, indicates that the medium thermalizes locally and a connection to QCD thermodynamics is possible. \n\nExperimental efforts started at lower beam energies, from Bevalac and AGS to the CERN-SPS, mounting up to highest beam energies at RHIC and the LHC. Recent interest has focused on the possibility of scanning the QCD phase diagram by varying the beam energy in the lower energy region. The recent beam energy scan phase I has been completed at RHIC where ample data has been taken and analyzed \\cite{Kumar:2012fb,Adamczyk:2013dal,Adamczyk:2014fia,Adare:2015aqk}. Currently, the beam energy and system size scan with the NA61 experiment at the CERN-SPS has started and future programs include the beam energy scan phase II at RHIC and upcoming facilities like the CBM \\cite{CBMphysicsbook} experiment at FAIR, GSI Helmholtz Center and NICA \\cite{NICAwhitepaper} at JINR in Dubna. The main goal of these endeavors is the investigation of the QCD phase transition and the discovery of a conjectured critical point at finite net-baryon density.\n\nFrom lattice QCD calculations at zero baryo-chemical potential it is known that the phase change between a partonic and a hadronic medium is an analytic crossover \\cite{Aoki:2006we} in the temperature range of $T_c=145-165$~MeV depending on the respective thermodynamic quantity \\cite{Borsanyi:2010bp}. From universality considerations \\cite{Hatta:2002sj}, studies of effective models \\cite{Scavenius:2000qd,Schaefer:2004en,Ratti:2005jh,Schaefer:2007pw,Pawlowski:2005xe,Skokov:2010wb,Herbst:2010rf} and the nonperturbative Dyson-Schwinger approach \\cite{Fischer:2012vc,Fischer:2014ata} there are good arguments for the existence of a critical point and a subsequent line of first-order phase transition in the phase diagram at finite net-baryon density. The location of the critical point is strongly parameter-dependent, e.g. if a vector-coupling is included, and on the approach to solve the thermodynamics of the model. \n\nIn this overview, I will focus on the connection between the thermodynamics of QCD matter and the experimental data obtained from heavy-ion collisions. Thermodynamics deals with infinite, static and homogeneous systems, which reach equilibrium in the long-time limit according to a set of controlled thermodynamic variables. Systems created in heavy-ion collisions, however, are very dynamical and undergo a variety of stages, e.g. initial state, pre-equilibrium, quark-gluon plasma and the hadronic gas, each contributing various effects to the final particle spectra. It is therefore necessary to include dynamical effects of the phase transition in realistic modeling of heavy-ion collisions and identify further contributions that impact signals of the QCD critical point.\n\n\\section{Fluctuation observables at the phase transition}\n\\label{sec:observables}\nAt the phase transition thermodynamic quantities change characteristically. This is seen in lattice calculations \\cite{Borsanyi:2013bia,Bazavov:2014noa} by the increase of, for example, the energy density scaled by the temperature, $e/T^4$, due to the liberation of color degrees of freedom. The speed of sound, $c_s^2=(\\partial p/\\partial e)_S$, has a minimum around the crossover transition and vanishes at a first-order phase transition. Similarly, the compressibility, $\\kappa_S=-1/V(\\partial V/\\partial p)_S$, has a maximum around the crossover transition and diverges at the first-order phase transition. These quantities are related to an anomaly in the pressure. It is straight forward to describe the phase transition in heavy-ion collisions via fluid dynamical calculations on the level of the equation of state and transport coefficients. In early (ideal) fluid dynamical calculations, for example, a pronounced minimum in the slope of the directed flow $v_1$ was observed at a first-order phase transition compared to the absence of a phase transition \\cite{Stoecker:2004qu}. Since modern calculations \\cite{Steinheimer:2014pfa} with improved schemes for particle production find a substantial reduction of this signal and hardly see any difference between the equation of state of a crossover and of a first-order phase transition, there is currently no confirmed impact of the anomaly in the pressure in simulations of heavy-ion collisions. \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.19\\textwidth]{Sigflucs1d.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.19\\textwidth]{Sigflucs2d.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.19\\textwidth]{Sigflucs3d.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.19\\textwidth]{Sigflucs4d.eps}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.19\\textwidth]{Sigflucs5d.eps}\n\\caption{Sketch of the order parameter and its derivatives at a phase transition.}\n\\label{fig:derivatives}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Susceptibilities and event-by-event fluctuations}\nWhile the order parameter(s) change characteristically at the phase transition, more details are revealed by taking derivatives, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:derivatives} for illustration.

This implies that in a dynamical setup, a system which traverses the critical point in any finite amount of time is necessarily driven out of equilibrium, even if it reached thermal equilibrium in some state away from the critical point. This effect is called critical slowing down and known to weaken the phenomena of criticality. A phenomenological evolution equation of the correlation length has been studied in \\cite{Berdnikov:1999ph} and the maximal size of the correlation length was found to extend to $1.5-2.5$~fm.\n\nLow-energy effective models of QCD, like the quark-meson (QM) or Polyakov quark-meson model (PQM) include some aspects of the QCD phase transition, like the chiral $O(4)$ or the $Z(2)$ symmetry. Compared to lattice calculations they do not capture all the aspects of QCD but can easily be studied at finite $\\mu_B$, give an insight into the active degrees of freedom and real-time calculations can in principle be carried out.  \nTypically, mean-field critical exponents and critical phenomena do not describe the correct physics as mesonic fluctuations and thus important correlations are neglected. Functional renormalization group methods can go beyond the mean-field approximation and provide valuable information about the fluctuations in conserved-charge densities. In \\cite{Skokov:2012ds} it has been shown that $\\chi_4/\\chi_2$ has a prominent $T$-$\\mu_B$-dependence and the signal grows stronger as the critical point is approached.\n\n\\subsection{Fluctuations at a first-order phase transition}\nFluctuations at a first-order phase transition are of a very different nature. They occur only if a nonequilibrium situation is present. At the transition temperature the high and low temperature phase coexist. These two stable phases are separated by a potential barrier, the latent heat. At temperatures above and below $T_c$ metastable states exist as remnants of the phase coexistence, still separated by a barrier. Thus, a system which is in thermal equilibrium above the phase transition and cools to a temperature slightly below the phase transition needs a finite time to relax over this barrier into the new stable phase. If this nucleation rate is small and the expansion (cooling) is fast, parts of the system remain in the metastable phase until it becomes unstable at the lower spinodal. Here, the low-momentum modes are amplified by spinodal decomposition, which leads to domain formation of the two phases \\cite{Csernai:1995zn,Mishustin:1998eq,Scavenius:2000bb,Keranen:2002sw,Randrup:2009gp,Randrup:2010ax,Steinheimer:2012gc,Herold:2013qda}.\n \n \\subsection{Critical fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions}\n In order to obtain predictions for measurable particles, the work in \\cite{Stephanov:1998dy,Stephanov:1999zu,Stephanov:2008qz,Athanasiou:2010kw} applied the theory of critical phenomena to heavy-ion collisions by looking at a coupling of the order parameter $\\sigma$ to protons via $g_p \\bar{p}\\sigma p$ and derived expressions for the $n$-th order cumulants of proton multiplicity distributions including the leading-order critical contribution\n \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 9788, "prevtext": "\nare independent of the volume to zero-th order in volume fluctuations.\nThe mean $M$, the variance $\\sigma^2$, the skewness $S$ and the kurtosis $\\kappa$ are obtained from measured event-by-event multiplicity distributions and can via Eqs.

In order to separate the interesting fluctuations from the the non-critical contributions it is therefore indispensable to carefully identify and study further sources of fluctuations: \n \\begin{itemize}\n  \\item[\\textbullet] If the limited detector acceptance is smaller than the critical correlation length of the measured particles, the signal is diminished. Similarly, any detector efficiency which is smaller than $100$\\% due induces additional fluctuations to the finite probability that a certain particle is not detected. This washes out the critical fluctuation signal. Under the assumption that the detection of each particle is independent with constant efficiency, i.e. that the distribution of $n$ detected particles out of $N$ particles reaching the detector in acceptance is binomial, this effect can be corrected according to \\cite{Bzdak:2012ab,Bzdak:2013pha}. If the assumption of a binomial distribution is justified remains to be carefully checked by the experiments.\n  \\item[\\textbullet] Experimentally, it is not feasible to detect the neutrons. Quasielastic scatterings of protons or neutrons with pions via a delta resonance ($p(n)+\\pi\\to\\Delta\\to n(p)+\\pi$) in the hadronic phase wash out the critical fluctuations in net-baryon number.

In order to go beyond and achieve a quantitative statement about the connection between the thermodynamics of the QCD critical point and experimental observables the dynamics of fluctuations needs to be included in realistic modeling of heavy-ion collisions. \n  \n In \\cite{Mukherjee:2015swa} it is shown that the magnitude and sign of the critical contributions to the fluctuation signals can be different in non-equilibrium situations compared to equilibrium expectations due to the importance of memory effects. In this work, the real-time evolution of non-Gaussian cumulants is studied in the scaling regime, where \n$L_{\\rm micro}\\ll\\xi\\ll L_{\\rm sys}$ via an expansion of the Fokker-Planck dynamics of the order parameter.

This implies that in a dynamical setup, a system which traverses the critical point in any finite amount of time is necessarily driven out of equilibrium, even if it reached thermal equilibrium in some state away from the critical point. This effect is called critical slowing down and known to weaken the phenomena of criticality. A phenomenological evolution equation of the correlation length has been studied in \\cite{Berdnikov:1999ph} and the maximal size of the correlation length was found to extend to $1.5-2.5$~fm.\n\nLow-energy effective models of QCD, like the quark-meson (QM) or Polyakov quark-meson model (PQM) include some aspects of the QCD phase transition, like the chiral $O(4)$ or the $Z(2)$ symmetry. Compared to lattice calculations they do not capture all the aspects of QCD but can easily be studied at finite $\\mu_B$, give an insight into the active degrees of freedom and real-time calculations can in principle be carried out.  \nTypically, mean-field critical exponents and critical phenomena do not describe the correct physics as mesonic fluctuations and thus important correlations are neglected. Functional renormalization group methods can go beyond the mean-field approximation and provide valuable information about the fluctuations in conserved-charge densities. In \\cite{Skokov:2012ds} it has been shown that $\\chi_4/\\chi_2$ has a prominent $T$-$\\mu_B$-dependence and the signal grows stronger as the critical point is approached.\n\n\\subsection{Fluctuations at a first-order phase transition}\nFluctuations at a first-order phase transition are of a very different nature. They occur only if a nonequilibrium situation is present. At the transition temperature the high and low temperature phase coexist. These two stable phases are separated by a potential barrier, the latent heat. At temperatures above and below $T_c$ metastable states exist as remnants of the phase coexistence, still separated by a barrier. Thus, a system which is in thermal equilibrium above the phase transition and cools to a temperature slightly below the phase transition needs a finite time to relax over this barrier into the new stable phase. If this nucleation rate is small and the expansion (cooling) is fast, parts of the system remain in the metastable phase until it becomes unstable at the lower spinodal. Here, the low-momentum modes are amplified by spinodal decomposition, which leads to domain formation of the two phases \\cite{Csernai:1995zn,Mishustin:1998eq,Scavenius:2000bb,Keranen:2002sw,Randrup:2009gp,Randrup:2010ax,Steinheimer:2012gc,Herold:2013qda}.\n \n \\subsection{Critical fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions}\n In order to obtain predictions for measurable particles, the work in \\cite{Stephanov:1998dy,Stephanov:1999zu,Stephanov:2008qz,Athanasiou:2010kw} applied the theory of critical phenomena to heavy-ion collisions by looking at a coupling of the order parameter $\\sigma$ to protons via $g_p \\bar{p}\\sigma p$ and derived expressions for the $n$-th order cumulants of proton multiplicity distributions including the leading-order critical contribution\n \n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\langle\\Delta N_p^n\\rangle =  \\langle (\\Delta N_p^0)^n\\rangle_c  + \\,\\langle (V\\Delta\\sigma)^n\\rangle_c \\left(\\frac{-g_{p}d_p}{T}\\int_k \\frac{n_p^0(k)(1-n_p^0(k))}{\\gamma_p(k)}\\right)^n\\, ,\n  \\label{eq:hrgflucs}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\langle\\Delta N_{p}^{n}\\rangle=\\langle(\\Delta N_{p}^{0})^{n}\\rangle_{c}+\\,%&#10;\\langle(V\\Delta\\sigma)^{n}\\rangle_{c}\\left(\\frac{-g_{p}d_{p}}{T}\\int_{k}\\frac{%&#10;n_{p}^{0}(k)(1-n_{p}^{0}(k))}{\\gamma_{p}(k)}\\right)^{n}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi>p</mi><mn>0</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mi>c</mi></msub><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">+</mo><mrow><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e8</mo><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>V</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u27e9</mo></mrow><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><msub><mi>g</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>d</mi><mi>p</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mi>T</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mi>k</mi></msub><mfrac><mrow><msubsup><mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mn>0</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mn>0</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b3</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>n</mi></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07437.tex", "nexttext": "\n where the chiral potential $U$, the scalar density $\\rho_s$ and the damping coefficient $\\eta$ are obtained from a chiral effective model like the (P)QM model.

This washes out the critical fluctuation signal. Under the assumption that the detection of each particle is independent with constant efficiency, i.e. that the distribution of $n$ detected particles out of $N$ particles reaching the detector in acceptance is binomial, this effect can be corrected according to \\cite{Bzdak:2012ab,Bzdak:2013pha}.

For a consistent treatment of viscosities, of the baryon conductivity and the dissipation-fluctuation theorem the equations for fluctuating viscous fluid dynamics read \\cite{Kapusta:2011gt,Murase:2013tma}\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{align}\n T^{\\mu\\nu}&=T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\rm eq}+\\Delta T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\rm visc}+\\Xi^{\\mu\\nu} \\, ,\\\\\n N^{\\mu}&=N^{\\mu}_{\\rm eq}+\\Delta N^{\\mu}_{\\rm visc}+{\\rm I}^{\\mu}\\, .\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle T^{\\mu\\nu}\" display=\"inline\"><msup><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi></mrow></msup></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\rm eq}+\\Delta T^{\\mu\\nu}_{\\rm visc}+\\Xi^{\\mu\\nu}\\,,\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>T</mi><mi>eq</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>T</mi><mi>visc</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi></mrow></msubsup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u039e</mi><mrow><mi>\u03bc</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03bd</mi></mrow></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle N^{\\mu}\" display=\"inline\"><msup><mi>N</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msup></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E10.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=N^{\\mu}_{\\rm eq}+\\Delta N^{\\mu}_{\\rm visc}+{\\rm I}^{\\mu}\\,.\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi>eq</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msubsup><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi>visc</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msubsup></mrow><mo>+</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">I</mi><mi>\u03bc</mi></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07437.tex", "nexttext": "\nAssuming enhanced conductivities at the critical point, the nonlinear fluid dynamical equations produce enhanced correlator of fluid dynamical densities in a  simple Bjorken expansion \\cite{Kapusta:2012zb}.

Remaining unknown quantities can be tuned by comparing to experimental observables, which are not signals for the critical point. For noncritical bulk observables this procedure is well established in current fluid dynamical calculations for example. In order to search for the QCD critical point, it becomes necessary to include the dynamics of critical fluctuations and to develop appropriate interfaces of these fluctuations with the initial fluctuations and correlations and for particlization.\n  Such a framework is also capable to treat noncritical effects quantitatively. \n  This paper outlined a couple of recent approaches to address the dynamics of critical fluctuations and gave an outlook of important current and future developments, in particular, in form of fluid dynamical fluctuations and their integration into realistic descriptions of the space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma and the hadronic stage. With these tools the discovery of the QCD critical point and the investigation of its properties at current and future heavy-ion collision experiments will become possible.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nM.N. acknowledges support from a fellowship within the Postdoc-Program of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
