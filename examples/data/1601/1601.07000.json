\\citealt{Sguera2005}, \\citealt{Negueruela2005a}) \nare a sub-class of high mass X--ray binaries (HMXBs) that was unveiled after the discovery \nby the {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}\\ satellite of many short hard X--ray transients in the Galactic plane \n\\cite[the first {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}\\ source of this class was discovered by][]{Sunyaev2003}.\n\nSFXTs host a neutron star (NS, hereafter) accreting from the wind\nof either an O or B-type supergiant and display rare outbursts\npunctuated by short ($\\sim$1-2 ks) luminous flares reaching 10$^{36}$--10$^{37}$~erg~s$^{-1}$,\ncharacterized by a duty cycle lower than a few \\% \n(\\citealt[][hereafter PS14]{Paizis2014}; \\citealt{Lutovinov2013}, \\citealt{Romano2014a}).\n\nWhen observed at softer X--rays (1-10 keV) with more sensitive instruments, \nSFXTs are caught at X--ray luminosities below 10$^{34}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ most of the time  \n(\\citealt{Sidoli2008:sfxts_paperI}, \\citealt{Romano2014b}, \\citealt{Bozzo2015}).\nIn some members of the class, a luminosity as low as 10$^{32}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ (1-10 keV) has been\nobserved, leading to a very high observed dynamic range (ratio between luminosity during outburst and quiescence)\nup to six orders of magnitude, in the most extreme case of the SFXT {IGR\\,J17544--2619}\\ \\citep{zand2005, Romano2015}.\n\n\nThe mechanism responsible for the SFXT flaring behavior, associated with the accretion\nonto the NS by a fraction of the donor wind, has been discussed by many authors.\nSome of them explain the SFXT flares with the particular properties \nof the compact object  \n(e.g. propeller effect or magnetic gating mechanism \\citep{Grebenev2007,Bozzo2008}), \nothers invoke a variety of orbital geometries together with the clumpy properties of the wind of the massive star\n(\\citealt{zand2005,Walter2007,Sidoli2007,Negueruela2008,Ducci2009}).\nMore recently, an alternative model has been proposed to explain bright flares in SFXTs  \\citep{Shakura2014},  \nbased on the instability of the quasi-spherical shell of captured matter which accumulates \nabove the magnetosphere of a slowly rotating NS at low accretion rates \\citep{Shakura2012}.\n\n\nAfter more than ten years from the discovery of SFXTs with {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}, \nthe {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS public archive is providing us with an observational data-set of X--ray flares detected from SFXTs \nthat is large enough to enable a statistical investigation.\n\nPS14 have exploited the {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}\\ archive, \ninvestigating the cumulative distributions of the hard X--ray luminosity (17--100 keV) of SFXT flares,\nfinding  that they follow a power-law distribution, completely different with respect to the log-normal luminosity \ndistribution shown by the emission from persistent ``classical'' HMXBs (e.g., Vela X--1).\nThese SFXT properties were succesfully interpreted by PS14 and \\citet{Shakura2014} \nin terms of the model of unstable settling  accretion onto slowly rotating magnetized NS \\citep{Shakura2012}.\n\n\nHere we investigate other important properties of the same sample of SFXT flares reported by PS14: \nthe waiting-time between two consecutive flares and the duration \nof the brightest phase of the outbursts, as observed by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}, \nin order to get more insights into the nature of these transients.\nWe refer to PS14 for the summary of the SFXT properties adopted in the present paper.\n\n\n\n  \t \\section{Data Analysis  \\label{sec:data}}\n\n\n\n\nWe focus here on the hard X--ray flares caught by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS observations covering about 9 years, from December 2002 to April 2012 (see PS14). \nIn the present work we consider the three SFXTs  \nwhich show the highest dynamic range ({XTE\\,J1739--302}, {IGR\\,J17544--2619}\\ and {SAX\\,J1818.6--1703}) and are often referred to as ``prototypical SFXTs'' in the literature.\n\nData selection and analysis  have already been reported by PS14, \nadopting the data reduction procedure described \nin detail by \\cite{Paizis2013}. \nWe refer the reader to these papers for the technical details. \n\nIn brief, the data-sets of detected X--ray flares consist of all IBIS pointing images (the so-called Science Windows, hereafter ScWs, with a typical\nexposure time of $\\sim$2~ks) where the sources were within $12{^\\circ}$~from the image centre and found to be \nactive (detection significance $>$5$\\sigma$). Therefore, in this work we use the image deconvolution results (${\\textsl{IMA}}$~results) as reported by PS14.\n\nAs already discussed in PS14, since the typical time scale of flare duration is \nconsistent with a ScW exposure time, we consider that a single IBIS/ISGRI detection on ScW level \nis representative of an SFXT flare. \n\n\nThe characterization of the luminosity distributions in hard X-rays of the  SFXT flares and their energy release  \nhave been already discussed  by PS14  and \\citet{Shakura2014}, respectively. \n\n\nIn the present work, we consider the same data-set of X--ray flares selected and reported by PS14 for the three\nsources {XTE\\,J1739--302}, {IGR\\,J17544--2619}\\ and {SAX\\,J1818.6--1703}, \nwith the aim of further characterizing their temporal properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \t \\section{Results \\label{sec:res}}\n\n\n\nWe consider  the light curves of the X--ray flares (luminosity is in the energy band 17--50 keV) \ndetected from the three SFXTs during {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS observations spanning about 9 years.\nTypical light curves during SFXT outbursts are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:lc_ex} (where\neach detection corresponds to a flare on ScW timescale). \n\nWe define waiting-time (WT) between two consecutive flares, the difference \nbetween the start times of two subsequent ScWs where\na SFXT flare is detected. \nThe shortest waiting-time corresponds to the duration of a ScW (in case of flares detected in adjacent ScWs). \nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:wt} we show  the cumulative distribution of waiting-times between ``consecutive'' flares, for each of the three targets.\n\nThe highly populated vertical lines in Fig.~\\ref{fig:wt},  corresponding to the shortest waiting-time (below 0.1 days), \nare produced by flares detected in adjacent ScWs.\n\nAt the opposite side of the x-axis,  waiting-times larger than 100~days might be significantly affected by the\ndata gaps between two satellite visibility windows of the source sky position, as suggested by the steepening of\nthe waiting-time distribution above 100~days, particularly evident in  {XTE\\,J1739--302}\\ and  {IGR\\,J17544--2619}. \n\nOther biases due to gaps in the data are unlikely to severily affect the shape of the \ntrue distribution at intermediate waiting-times (between a few days and 100~days), given the low duty cycles of these three SFXTs.\n\nAn interesting feature present in all three waiting-time distributions is \na plateau just above $\\sim$1~day (i.e. missing waiting-times in that temporal range). \nThis strongly suggests that a waiting-time of $\\sim$1~day \n(1.4~day, to be precise, in order to include the last point of the plateau in {SAX\\,J1818.6--1703})\ncan be adopted as a timescale to separate the flaring \nactivity belonging to two  different and subsequent outbursts\n(each composed by a cluster of many flares). \n\nThis makes it  possible to derive the time duration of single outbursts and to study their \nstatistical properties (e.g., cumulative distribution) and correlations. \n\nIn order to determine the total duration of a bright X--ray flaring activity episode (a single outburst) \nas observed by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS, we adopt the following procedure: \nfor each SFXT, we start from the second X--ray flare detected in the {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS light curve and calculate its \nwaiting-time with respect to the first flare. \nIf this waiting-time is lower than 1~day, then the flare is assumed to belong to the\nsame bright outburst phase as the previous flare. \n\nPerforming this comparison with the following flares, at one point there will be a flare for which the waiting-time with respect\nto the immediatly previous flare is greater than 1 day. At this point the procedure stops and a list of clusters of flares (i.e. outburst) \nis produced for the three SFXTs.\n\nThis automatic process has led to the empirical determination of the duration of the SFXTs outbursts, as observed by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}.\nTo do this, we defined two different temporal quantities: \nthe {\\em total duration} (D) of the brightest phase of an outburst and the {\\em elapsed time interval} ($\\Delta $t) between the first and the last\nflare belonging to an outburst  (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:lc_ex}, upper panel and caption, for an example).\n\nMore in detail: for each source, for each single outburst, we calculated the total duration (D) simply by adding together\nthe durations, d$_i$, of single flares belonging to the same outburst (D=$\\sum _{i=1}^N d_i$, where N is the number \nof flares in a single outburst). \n\nSince the  flares composing an outburst can be either detected in adjacent pointings or not, \nD can be interpreted as the integrated time each SFXT spends in its brightest state during a single outburst as observed by IBIS.\n\nDurations D lower than 2-3~ks imply that only one isolated flare is caught by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}\\ during a supposed (although unobserved) longer outburst. \nVery likely, these single flares represent the brightest activity of outburts with average fainter luminosity, \nwhere {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}\\ detects only the brightest part. \n\nAnother temporal quantity that can be calculated from the light curves of X--ray flares, for each outburst, is\nthe elapsed time interval,  $\\Delta $t (where $\\Delta $t=tstop$_{N}$-tstart$_{1}$) between the first (``1'') and the last (``N'') \nflare belonging to\nthe same outburst (as previously defined). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n\\includegraphics[height=6.3cm, angle=0]{./fig1a.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=6.3cm, angle=0]{./fig1b.ps}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Examples of SFXT light curves during outbursts ({XTE\\,J1739--302}), as observed by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}\\  (17--50 keV): a longer ({\\em upper panel}) and a shorter outburst ({\\em lower panel}).

The upper panel clearly shows the difference between two timescales defined in the text (the total duration ``D'' of the active phase of this outburst is 16~ks, while the elapsed time ``$\\Delta$t'' between the last and the first flare of the same outburst is 10$^{5}$~s; see text for details). } \n\\label{fig:lc_ex}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Cumulative distributions}\n\nThe cumulative distributions of the durations D of the brightest phase in each single outburst\nfor the 3 SFXTs considered here are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:dur}.\n\nIn particular, an evident \nflattening at short durations is present in the {IGR\\,J17544--2619}\\ duration distribution, due to single flares.\n\nWhile the cumulative distribution of the outburst duration in {SAX\\,J1818.6--1703}\\ appears to be exponential, in the case of \n{IGR\\,J17544--2619}\\ and {XTE\\,J1739--302}, if we exclude the flatter region at low duration composed by single flares, they are power-law-like. \nAdopting a maximum-likelihood estimation  of the power-law slope (PS14) from a \nsubsample of data points above a truncation point of 2~ks and 3~ks (respectively for {XTE\\,J1739--302}\\ and {IGR\\,J17544--2619}), \nwe obtained a power-law slope, $\\beta$, of 1.6$\\pm${0.6} able to adequately describe \nthe cumulative distribution outburst duration in {IGR\\,J17544--2619}, while $\\beta$=0.5$\\pm{0.2}$ in {XTE\\,J1739--302}.\n\nWe note that in all three SFXTs, the cumulative distribution of the \ntotal durations of the outburst phases (in their brightest phase, the one that IBIS is able to detect) \ndisplay a cut-off above 10~ks. In particular, the maximum outburst durations observed in our data-set \n are 13~ks in {SAX\\,J1818.6--1703}, 26~ks in {IGR\\,J17544--2619}~and 29~ks in {XTE\\,J1739--302}.\n\n\nThe distributions of the  elapsed times, $\\Delta $t, for the three SFXTs are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:deltat}.\n\nNote that in case of outbursts made of a single isolated flare, again, $\\Delta $t is equal to the duration \nof the single flare. This causes the flattening of the distributions at low  $\\Delta $t around 1-2~ks (and below).\n\nAbove this timescale, the distribution of $\\Delta $t in {XTE\\,J1739--302}\\ shows a steepening (higher frequency of flares) \naround 5-6~ks, with a few outbursts composed by only 2-3 flares, \nwhile above 10~ks the cumulative distribution is power-law-like. \nIn {IGR\\,J17544--2619}\\ a power-law-like distribution of $\\Delta $t is present above around 5-6~ks, while in \n{SAX\\,J1818.6--1703}\\ a roll-over above about 30-40~ks emerges.\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig2a.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig2b.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig2c.ps}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cumulative distributions of the waiting-times (WT) between two consecutive  \nbright flares in the three SFXTs \nas observed by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS in about nine years of data (17--50\\,keV).}\n\\label{fig:wt}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig3a.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig3b.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig3c.ps}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cumulative distributions of the duration (D)\nof the outbursts  in the three SFXTs, as observed by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS (17--50\\,keV).}\n\\label{fig:dur}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig4a.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig4b.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig4c.ps}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cumulative distributions of elapsed times ($\\Delta$t) \nin the three SFXTs, as observed by {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS (17--50\\,keV).}\n\\label{fig:deltat}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:all},  we show the cumulative distribution of\nthe total durations (D$_{all}$, upper panel) and elapsed times ($\\Delta$t$_{all}$, lower panel), \nrespectively, taken from combining \ntimescales characterizing the outbursts from all three SFXTs.\nIt is remarkable that a power-law distribution is able to adequately describe the global \nbehaviour of the three prototypical\nSFXTs, with slopes, $\\beta$, of 0.9$\\pm{0.3}$ and 0.3$\\pm{0.1}$ for D$_{all}$ (above $\\sim$2~ks) \nand $\\Delta$t$_{all}$ (above $\\sim$6~ks), respectively.\n\nA roll-over is present at higher timescales (above $\\sim$10~ks for the overall \ndurations D$_{\\rm all}$, while above $\\sim$30-40~ks in the distribution of all elapsed times $\\Delta$t$_{\\rm all}$).\n\nThe overall regular shape of the two plots is suggestive of the fact that we\nare seeing the same phenomenology at work in the three sources, as if to say\nthat by merging the results from the three prototypical SFXTs, we are\nobserving a single SFXT with a broader coverage, where almost no timescale is\nmissed due to observability gaps.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig5a.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=5.3cm, angle=0]{./fig5b.ps}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Cumulative distributions of the durations (D$_{all}$, {\\em upper panel}) \nand elapsed times ($\\Delta$t$_{all}$, {\\em lower panel}) obtained from combining\nall outbursts observed from all the three SFXTs analysed here.}\n\\label{fig:all}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The energy released in the outburst versus its duration}\n \nThe procedure of separation of individual outburst (a collection of physically connected flares) \nfrom the $INTEGRAL$ data outlined above enables us to study their different statistical properties. \nIn Fig.~\\ref{lsfig:fit} we plot the total energy released in the j-th outburst, $\\Delta E_j$, \nas a function of its total duration, $\\Delta T_j$. \n\nIn Figs.~\\ref{lsfig:fit} the total energy is reported in units of ergs (left panels) \nand of total IBIS/ISGRI counts (17--50~keV; right panels),\nto clearly show that the main contribution to the uncertainty is the source distance \n(see PS14 for details on conversion factors from counts to physical units).\n\n\nHere\n$\\Delta E_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_j} \\delta t_i f_i$ which is the total energy\nreleased during the j-th outburst, $\\delta t_i$ is the\nduration of i-th flare in the outburst \n(which was taken to be the duration of an $INTEGRAL$\nScW) and $f_i$ is the mean luminosity (erg~s$^{-1}$) of a single flare (using a ``bin time'' of one ``ScW'').\n\nIn this plot, $\\Delta T_j$ is the outburst duration (in the sense of\nthe ``elapsed time'' interval \n$\\Delta$t shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:deltat}). \nIt should be taken into account \nthat the\nshortest $\\Delta T_j$ (2000 seconds and shorter) are actually the durations\nof a single ScW, when the ``outburst'' detected by $INTEGRAL$ is composed by a single flare.\n\n\nIt is seen from Figs.~\\ref{lsfig:fit} (summarized also in Figs.~\\ref{lsfig:allfit}) \nthat there is a correlation between the energy released in the outburst and its duration.\n\nWe will discuss this correlation below. \n\n\n\n\t      \n\t      \\section{Discussion}\\label{sec:discussion}\n\t      \n\n\n\nFor this study we have used the {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}/IBIS data-set of three SFXTs reported by PS14: {SAX\\,J1818.6--1703}, {IGR\\,J17544--2619}\\ and {XTE\\,J1739--302}.\n\nWe characterized the temporal properties of these flares calculating  the waiting-time between SFXT \nflares, the duration of the outburst phase as observed at hard X--rays\nby {\\textit{INTEGRAL}}, and the elapsed times between the first and the last flare belonging to the same oubturst.\nWe have observed a clustering of bright flares with waiting-times less than $\\sim$1~day, \nwhich was later used to quantify the effective duration of a bright phase of an ``outburst''. \n\nFinally, we have calculated the cumulative distribution of these time scales (durations and elapsed times) of \nall outbursts from all three SFXTs, finding a power-law-like behaviour.\n\nIn PS14 we concentrated on the cumulative distributions of the hard X--ray luminosity of a sample of SFXTs, compared\nto other three high mass X--ray binaries (HMXBs), while \\citet{Shakura2014} compared distribution of energy of SFXTs flares\nwith the quasi-spherical settling accretion model, suggesting that the reconnection of magnetic fields carried out by stellar wind from OB-supergiants can be \nthe physical mechanism able to trigger the opening of the NS magnetosphere, causing the sudden accretion of the captured matter, and \nproducing the X--ray flare. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n\\includegraphics[height=8.8cm, angle=-90]{fig6a.ps} & \n\\includegraphics[height=8.8cm, angle=-90]{fig6b.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=8.8cm, angle=-90]{fig6c.ps} & \n\\includegraphics[height=8.8cm, angle=-90]{fig6d.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=8.8cm, angle=-90]{fig6e.ps} & \n\\includegraphics[height=8.8cm, angle=-90]{fig6f.ps}  \n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Power-law fits  to the outburst energy (17--50\\,keV) versus elapsed times $\\Delta$t (i.e. outburst duration, as defined in the text) of the 3 SFXTs. \nOn the {\\em left} the panels showing the best-fit power-law to the energy versus elapsed times, on the {\\em right} the  best-fit power-law to the  IBIS/ISGRI counts \nversus elapsed times.\nLarge uncertainties are mainly due to the large uncertainty on the source distances ($\\pm{1}$~kpc in XTE~J1739--302  and IGR~J17544--2619;

We remind that the key feature of the model is the \nsettling accretion regime onto a slowly rotating magnetized NS (\\citealt{Shakura2012}, \\citealt{Shakura2015}). \n\nThis regime can set in if the X-ray luminosity from the NS is below a few times $10^{36}$~erg s$^{-1}$. At this stage, \na hot convective shell is formed around slowly rotating NS magnetosphere, and the plasma entry to the NS magnetosphere is mediated \nby plasma cooling (Compton at higher accretion rates and radiative at low accretion rates). \n\nWe argued that at the quiescent stage of SFXTs the accretion rate onto the NS is $\\dot M_a\\simeq \\dot M_B f(u)_\\mathrm{rad}^{1/3}$, \nwhere $\\dot M_B$ is the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton mass accretion rate \n(determined by the surrounding wind density $\\rho_w$ and velocity $v_w$) and $f(u)_\\mathrm{rad}\\sim 0.03-0.1$ is the reduction \nfactor due to radiation plasma cooling.  \n\nA magnetized stellar wind from the optical OB supergiant companion was proposed as trigger for an SFXT flare \ndue to reconnection of large-scale magnetic field carried by the wind (Shakura et al. 2014). \n\nIt was shown that the magnetic reconnection preferably occurs at small $f(u)$, which exactly corresponds to low states of SFXTs.\nAt higher $f(u)$ and, hence, higher plasma entry rate into magnetosphere, the reconnection time is higher than the plasma magnetospheric entry time \ndue to instabilities, so the magnetic field is admixed with plasma; this  may cause additional X--ray variability with temporal properties different from \nwhat is observed, for example, in steady-state accreting X-ray pulsars like Vela X-1 (\\citealt{Furst2010}, PS14). \n\nDuring each flare initiated by the appearance of open field magnetic lines due to reconnection, the entire mass of the shell around the magnetosphere is accreted onto NS over a time interval corresponding to the free-fall time form the outer boundary of the shell (around the Bondi gravitational capture radius $R_B\\approx 2GM/v_w^2$), typically of the order of 1000 s. \n\nIn this picture, the SFXT outburst is represented by a chain of flares which are physically connected to one large region of magnetized stellar wind. Therefore, the temporal properties of flares in the outburst should bear information about the magnetized wind structure. \n\nSolar wind studies suggest \\citep{Zelenyi2004}\nthat the equatorial magnetized wind agglomerates into a fractal structure with the Hausdorf dimension of $d_f\\approx 4/3$, i.e. the mass inside the \nregion of size $l$ grows as $M_l \\sim l^{d_f}$. \nIn the context of the present study, the size of the magnetized stellar wind region is related to the duration of the outburst, $l \\sim \\Delta t \\times v_w$, where $v_w\\sim 1000$~km s$^{-1}$ is the typical stellar wind velocity. \n\nTherefore, Fig.~\\ref{fig:all} \nsuggests that the longest outbursts $\\sim 10^5$ s correspond to the largest size of the magnetized wind clouds of about 100 $R_\\odot$, which is commensurable to the orbital separation in these sources.\n\nThe gravitational capture (Bondi) radius $R_B$ for the typical wind velocity from O-supergiants $\\sim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$ is about \n$2\\times 10^{10}$ cm, much smaller than the orbital separation. Therefore, during an outburst of duration $\\Delta t$, the volume of the wind captured by NS is $\\Delta V_0\\sim R_B^2\\times v_w\\times \\Delta t$. \n\nSuppose this volume to contain $N$ clumps with some mass distribution (which is actually not important for our purposes). \n\nWe stress once again here, while several authors in previous literature have discussed the possibility of direct accretion of wind clumps in SFXTs (e.g. \\citealt{Walter2007}), we adopt here the completely different scenario of settling accretion. This means that not only the wind dense clumps, which are present at all times, are responsible for the SFXT activity, but their special properties (e.g., temporarily ejected magnetized lamps of the O-supergiant clumpy wind) are needed to trigger SFXT outbursts.\n\nThe mass in the clumps is $\\Delta M=\\sum_{i=1}^N\\rho_i V_i$, where $\\rho_i$ and $V_i$ is the density and volume of the $i$-th\nclump, respectively. Assume the mean clump density $\\rho_1$ for all clumps, which is much larger than the \ndensity of the surrounding wind. Then the total mass within the volume $V_0$ reads $\\Delta M\\approx \\rho_1\\sum_{i=1}^NV_i$, \nneglecting the interclump mass. Therefore, the average density of the wind is $\\bar \\rho_w=\\Delta M/V_0$. \nIn the case of the magnetized wind, as we mentioned, during an outburst the magnetospheric instability due to reconnection effectively leads \nto the Bondi accretion regime, i.e. we expect that the total mass accreted onto NS in the entire outburst should be around $\\Delta M$. \nAs the accreted mass corresponds to the total energy $\\Delta E$ released in the outburst, it is expected that \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta E\\propto \\bar\\rho_w \\Delta t\\,.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta E\\propto\\bar{\\rho}_{w}\\Delta t\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>E</mi></mrow><mo>\u221d</mo><mrow><msub><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">\u00af</mo></mover><mi>w</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>t</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.07000.tex", "nexttext": "\nClearly, in the case of homogeneous (on average, although maybe clumpy) wind density with $d_f=3$ \nthe linear dependence of the released energy on the outburst duration, $\\Delta E\\sim \\Delta t$ is expected.\nNote that here we assumed a constant wind velocity, which seems to be reasonable in so far as the \nduration of the even longest outburst is much smaller than the orbital period of the binary system.\n\nIf we take into account the possible additional wind acceleration between the companion and the NS location, \nthe power-law index in \nthe above relation $\\Delta E \\sim \\Delta t^b$ will increase: $b> d_f-2$. \n\nEq.

Again, in the case of on average homogeneous wind with $d_f=3$,\na linear dependence is expected. In Fig. \\ref{f:DvDt} we plot these relation for three SFXTs under study (the straight line marks linearity in the three cases).\n\nAs it is unclear how to estimate errors in $D$ and $\\Delta t$, it is not possible to perfom a formal fit to the data.\nHowever, we note that in the worst case, on the y-axis the error on the ``D'' values could reach 10\\% at most, while on the x-axis \neach elapsed time $\\Delta t_i$ is, in the worst case, constrained in the range [$\\Delta t_i$, $\\Delta t_i$+1~day], by definition.\nSo, it is clearly seen that non-linearity appears with increasing outburst duration, in all sources. \\footnote{The strictly linear behaviour for  $Dt<3000$~s correspond to the 'outbursts' consisting of isolated flares, as mentioned in Section 3, for which $Dt=D$ by definition.}\n\nThis is indeed expected, since deviations from homogeneity for (physical) fractal structures are more prominent on large scales. \n\n\nObviously, increase in the outburst statistics would allow a more precise statistical analysis.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\includegraphics[height=7.3cm, angle=-90]{fig8a.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=7.3cm, angle=-90]{fig8b.ps} \\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=7.3cm, angle=-90]{fig8c.ps}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Total duration of outburst ($D$) versus elapsed times $\\Delta$t (i.e. outburst duration, as defined in the text) of the 3 SFXTs.
