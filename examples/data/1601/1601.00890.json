One particularly intriguing topological system is the \nthree-dimensional Weyl semimetal\\cite{mur07}. In the simplest possible realization\nof a Weyl semimetal, there are at least two \\textit{distinct} points in the Brillouin zone (BZ), \nwhere the conduction and the valence bands touch. These points are called Weyl points (WPs) and they always come in pairs.\nUsually these WPs are protected by some crystalline symmetry and the two WPs forming a pair represent \na source and a sink of Berry curvature\\cite{wan11,bur11a,bur11b,GalBal,zyu12,liu13,yan11,vol09}. \nExperimental realizations of WPs have been reported in $\\textrm{TaP}, \\textrm{NbP}, \\textrm{TaAs}, \\textrm{NbAs}$\\cite{xu15a, lv15a, lv15b, \nshe15, yan15, xu15b, zha15}. The topological nature of Weyl semimetals gives rise to \nFermi arc surface states, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and chiral-anomaly related negative magnetoresistance~\\cite{nie83,zyu12b,hos13,Burkov_rev,son13,zha15b,xio15,hua15}. \n\n\nMost recently, a new type of Weyl semimetal, with a tilted conical spectrum, such that the WP transforms to a Dirac line or a Fermi surface has been proposed~\\cite{vol14}. \nThese Weyl semimetals are now called type-II Weyl semimetals (WSM2s) and WTe$_2$ is a possible candidate for an experimental realization of such a phase~\\cite{sol15}. The various transport and\nthermodynamic properties of these WSM2 are very different from those of the usual type-I Weyl semimetal (WSM1), partially due to marked differences in the density \nof states of the type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals at the Fermi level. Ideal WSM1 has a conical spectrum and a point-like Fermi surface at the WP. Imagine this \nconical spectrum \\textit{getting} tilted towards some direction in the Brillouin zone (see Figs.~\\ref{fig:tiltconekz} and ~\\ref{fig:tiltconekx}). \nThis tilt can be attributed to strain or chemical doping of the original WSM1. If this tilt is small enough such that the Fermi surface remains point-like, the \nsystem is still classified as WSM1. However, large tilting of the conical spectrum results in a Lifshitz transition to a new phase classified as WSM2, \nwhere the Fermi surface is no longer point-like~\\cite{vol14,sol15}. Instead, now the density of states at the WP is \\textit{finite}. For a linearized \nmodel as shown in Figs.~\\ref{fig:tiltconekz} and ~\\ref{fig:tiltconekx}, the density of states at the Fermi level depends upon the cutoff $\\Lambda$ in momentum space, \nbeyond which a linear description of the excitations around the WP is no longer valid. As noted in Ref.~\\onlinecite{sol15}, it is possible to have a WSM2, where \none WP is of type-I and its partner (of opposite chirality) WP is of type-II.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{nfig1}\\caption{(color online) The tilted conical spectrum around the Weyl points (WPs).

In other words, the chiral-anomaly related negative magnetoresistance in WSM2\nis anisotropic.\n\nIn this article, we investigate the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in WSM2 and \ncompare our results with the AHE in WSM1. The AHE in WSM1 is fully determined by the location of the WPs in BZ~\\cite{bur14}. \nWe find that in addition to the location of the WPs in the BZ, the AHE in WSM2 depends crucially on the tilts of the conical spectrum around the two WPs. We explore two distinct \nregimes, one where the tilts are in the direction pointing along the line separating the two WPs (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:tiltconekz}) and the other where the tilts are in a direction perpendicular to the line \nseparating the two WPs (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:tiltconekx}). For each of these regimes, we consider various possible tilting angles for the two WPs.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{nfig2}\\caption{(color online) The tilted conical spectrum around the Weyl points (WPs).

II) we describe our model and the calculation of the AHE in WSM2. In Sec. III, we present a\ndiscussion of our results, highlighting the key differences between the AHE in WSM1 and WSM2, and finally in Sec. IV, we present a summary of our main results before \npresenting our concluding remarks.\n\n\\section{AHE in WSM2}\n\nConsider the simplest kind of Weyl semimetal state with only two WPs. To be classified as WSM2, at least one of these WPs should have a tilt in some direction in the \nBZ, such that the Fermi surface around that WP is no longer point-like. We analyze the AHE in two different regimes, the first where the direction of tilt is along the \ndirection in which the two WPs are separated and the second where the direction of tilt is orthogonal to the direction in which \nthe two WPs are separated. In both regimes the Hall conductivity is calculated using the Kubo formula.\n\n\\subsection{Splitting of Weyl points along the direction of tilt} \nThe low-energy model of two WPs of opposite chirality, at the same energy, and separated in the momentum space is described by the Hamiltonian\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\nonumber\nH_{1}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar C_{1} (k_z- Q) + \\hbar v {\\boldsymbol \\sigma} \\cdot (\\mathbf{k} - Q \\mathbf{e}_z),\\\\\nH_{2}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar C_{2} (k_z+ Q) - \\hbar v {\\boldsymbol \\sigma} \\cdot (\\mathbf{k} + Q \\mathbf{e}_z),\n\\label{eq:Hamkz}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $2Q$ is the distance between the WPs in momentum space along $\\mathbf{e}_z$, \n\n$v$ is the Fermi velocity when $C_1=C_2=0$, and ${\\boldsymbol \\sigma}$ \nis a vector composed of the three Pauli matrices.\nWe set $\\hbar =1$ throughout the intermediate steps of our calculation and restore it in the final expressions.\nThe type of the WP is defined by the parameter $C_{\\chi}$, $\\chi\\in\\{1,2\\}$. WP is of so-called type-II if $|C_{\\chi}|>v$. In this case the WP coexists with \nthe electron and hole Fermi pockets~\\cite{vol14,sol15}. The one-particle Green functions have the following form\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\nonumber\nG_{1}(\\omega_n,\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{s=\\pm 1} \\frac{(1-s{\\boldsymbol \\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_{\\mathbf{k}- Q\\mathbf{e}_z})/2}{i\\omega_n+\\mu -C_{1} (k_z- Q) +s v |\\mathbf{k}- Q\\mathbf{e}_z|},\\\\\n\\nonumber\nG_{2}(\\omega_n,\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{s=\\pm 1} \\frac{(1+s{\\boldsymbol \\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{N}_{\\mathbf{k}+ Q\\mathbf{e}_z})/2}{i\\omega_n+\\mu -C_{2} (k_z+ Q) +s v |\\mathbf{k}+ Q\\mathbf{e}_z|},\\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\omega_n$ is the fermionic Matsubara frequency, \n\n$\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\mathbf{N}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\mathbf{k}/k$ is the unit vector in the direction of wave-vector $\\mathbf{k}$.\nIn what follows we assume for concreteness that $\\mu\\geqslant 0$.\n\nThe anomalous Hall conductivity is given by the zero frequency and zero wave-vector limit of the current-current correlation function \n\\begin{eqnarray}\\nonumber\n\\Pi_{ij}(\\Omega,\\mathbf{q}) &=& T\\sum_{\\omega_n}\\sum_{\\chi=1,2}\\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} J_{i}^{(\\chi)} G_{\\chi}(\\omega_n+\\Omega_m,\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q})\\\\\n&\\times&J_{j}^{(\\chi)} G_{\\chi}(\\omega_n,\\mathbf{k})\\bigg|_{i\\Omega_m\\rightarrow \\Omega + i\\delta},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $T$ is the temperature (the Boltzmann constant is set to unity), as:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\sigma_{xy} = -\\lim_{\\Omega\\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\Pi_{xy}(\\Omega,0)}{i\\Omega}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe current operators are defined as follows\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nJ_{i}^{(1,2)} = e  \\left(C_{1,2}\\delta_{iz} \\pm v \\sigma_i \\right).\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"J_{i}^{(1,2)}=e\\left(C_{1,2}\\delta_{iz}\\pm v\\sigma_{i}\\right).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>J</mi><mi>i</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>C</mi><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03b4</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>\u00b1</mo><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00890.tex", "nexttext": "\nHere, we have restored the Planck constant $\\hbar$.

The total Hall \nconductivity of the Weyl semimetal is a sum of the Hall conductivity due to both WPs ($\\sigma_{xy}=\\sigma_{xy}^{(1)}+\\sigma_{xy}^{(2)}$). First we discuss the case, \nwhere the tilt is in $\\mathbf{e}_z$. If both WPs are of type-I, ($|C_1| < v$ and $|C_2| < v$) the Hall conductivity for $\\mu=0$ is universal (independent of the \nparameters $C_1$ and $C_2$) and is given by $\\sigma_{xy}=\\frac{e^2Q}{2\\pi^2\\hbar}$. If one of the WPs is of type-I and the other of type-II, for e.g., $|C_1| > v$ and $|C_2| < v$, \nthe total Hall conductivity for $\\mu=0$ is independent of $C_2$ but depends upon $C_1$, and is given by $\\sigma_{xy}=\\frac{e^2Q}{4\\pi^2\\hbar}(1+\\frac{v}{|C_1|})$. The \\textit{decreasing} \ncontribution from the WP of type-II can be understood as follows. Due to the tilting of the conical spectrum of the WP of type-II the Hall conductivity now has a contribution \nfrom both electron and hole like carriers. In fact the contribution of this type-II WP vanishes completely in the limit $|C_1|\\rightarrow\\infty$ and the total Hall conductivity \nbecomes $\\sigma_{xy}=\\frac{e^2Q}{4\\pi^2\\hbar}$. \nIf both WPs are of type-II, the Hall conductivity in general depends upon both parameters $|C_1|>v$ and $|C_2|>v$. A particularly interesting situation is reached if the tilts \nof the two WPs are opposite to each other. Fig.~\\ref{fig:Tilt_kz} shows the anomalous Hall conductivity in this situation for various values of $\\mu$ and $C_2=-C_1$. Note that when we \nhave a WSM2, the Hall conductivity changes sign as a function of $C_1$ (in the right half $C_1 > v$) for large values of $\\mu$. The decreasing contribution from the WP of type-II \nis also observed when the tilt is in $\\mathbf{e}_x$ [see Eq.(\\ref{eq:sigmaxy12kx})].\n\nIt is important to stress that our calculations are performed using a linear dispersion model of the excitations around \nthe WPs. An unbounded linear dispersion is not realistic for a solid state realization of WSM2. In a realistic case the linear dispersion will have a cut-off ($\\Lambda$) \nin momentum space, beyond which the excitations in WSM2 are no longer described by a linearized model. This cut-off $\\Lambda$ is also a measure of the density of states at the\nWP for a WSM2. The contribution of these large momentum ($>\\Lambda$) states is ignored in our calculation. Another crucial point to note is that the conduction and the valence \nbands for the two distinct WPs are connected in the BZ by these large momentum states. Figs.~\\ref{fig:tiltconekz} and ~\\ref{fig:tiltconekx} suggest that the electronic band-structure\nof the WSM2 can be drastically modified for large values of the parameters $C_1$ and $C_2$. Thus, in general the contribution of the large momentum states to the AHE will depend \nupon the details of the electronic band-structure of a specific realization of WSM2 and will not be universal. \n\nFinally, we estimate the value of the anomalous Hall conductivity considering $\\textrm{WTe}_2$ as a possible WSM2. \nAssuming the splitting between the two WPs to be $Q=(0.01) \\textrm{\\AA}^{-1}$\n, we obtain $\\sigma_{xy} = \\frac{e^2 Q}{2\\pi^2 \\hbar} \\approx 10 $ per Ohm per cm, which is of the same order as the anomalous Hall conductivity in magnetic conductors\\cite{AnomHall}. The dependence of $\\sigma_{xy}/(\\frac{e^2 Q}{2\\pi^2 \\hbar})$ on the Fermi energy \nis shown in Fig.\\ref{fig:Tilt_kz}.\n\n\n\\section{Summary}\nWe have investigated the anomalous Hall effect in type-II Weyl semimetal within a linear dispersion model using the Kubo formula. Our findings suggest that unlike in type-I Weyl semimetal, the \nanomalous Hall effect in type-II Weyl semimetal is not universal and in general \ndepends on the parameters quantifying the tilt of the conical spectrum around the Weyl points. So far there has been no experimental evidence for the existence of type-II Weyl semimetal. Thus, a measurement of \nthe anomalous Hall effect can help in categorizing the two different types of Weyl semimetals. If the Weyl semimetal is of type-II, the measurement of anomalous Hall effect can provide information about the tilt parameters \nassociated with these type-II Weyl semimetals. By applying strain and thereby changing the lattice constant for materials such as HgTe~\\cite{rua15}, one can potentially measure the anomalous Hall effect as a function of the tilt \nparameters and verify our predictions.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\n  We would like to acknowledge fruitful discussions with A.

Note that $\\sigma_{xy}$ does not depend on $C_{1,2}$ for $|C_{1,2}|<v$, while it becomes non universal at $|C_{1,2}|>v$ and decreases with an increase of $|C_{1}|$ or $|C_{2}|$. \nIn both limits $\\sigma_{xy}$ is proportional to the distance between the WPs\\cite{bur11a}. \nThe condition $|C_{\\chi}| = v$ describes the case when the Weyl cone touches the Fermi level. Thus the non analytic behaviour of the anomalous Hall conductivity \nis related to the van-Hove singularity in the density of states at the Fermi level.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{sxy1.pdf}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:Tilt_kz} \n(color online) Normalized anomalous Hall conductivity $\\sigma_{xy}/(\\frac{e^2 Q}{2 \\pi^2 \\hbar})$ as a function of the parameter $C_1/v$\nfor different values of the normalized chemical potential $\\mu/(\\hbar vQ)$, and fixed $C_2 = -C_1$.
