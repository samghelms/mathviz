In agreement with recent work, we find that discs with radially\ndecreasing temperature profiles and short thermal relaxation time-scales, are subject to \nthe axisymmetric VSI. In three dimensions, the resulting velocity perturbations give \nrise to quasi-axisymmetric potential vorticity perturbations that break-up into discrete \nvortices, in a manner that is reminiscent of the Rossby wave instability. \nDiscs with very short thermal evolution time-scales (i.e. $\\tau \\le 0.1$ local orbit periods) \ndevelop strong vorticity perturbations that roll up into vortices that have small aspect ratios \n($\\chi \\le 2$) and short lifetimes ($\\sim$ a few orbits). Longer thermal time-scales give \nrise to vortices with larger aspect ratios ($6 \\le \\chi \\le 10$), and lifetimes that depend \non the entropy gradient. A steeply decreasing entropy profile leads to\nvortex lifetimes that exceed the simulation run times of hundreds of orbital periods.\nVortex lifetimes in discs with positive or weakly decreasing entropy profiles are much \nshorter, being 10s of orbits at most, suggesting that the subcritical baroclinic instability \nplays an important role in sustaining vortices against destruction through the\nelliptical instability. Applied to the outer regions of protoplanetary discs,\nwhere the VSI is most likely to occur, our results suggest that vortices formed by \nthe VSI are likely to be short lived structures.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{keywords}\naccretion, accretion discs - \nhydrodynamics - \ninstabilities - \nprotoplanetary discs - \nturbulence\n\\end{keywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nThe presence of long-lived vortices in protoplanetary discs has long been considered\nas a means of enhancing the planet building process because of the ability\nof these anticyclonic structures to capture and concentrate dust grains\n\\citep{Weizsacker1944,BargeSommeria1995,Johansen2004}.\nThe presence of vortices in discs can also lead to significant transport of\nangular momentum through the excitation of spiral density waves \\citep{Johnson2005b}.\nIn spite of the potential importance of vortices for the evolution of protoplanetary discs\nand planet formation, however, the following questions do not yet have definitive answers:\nIf vortices exist in protoplanetary discs, what are their formation mechanisms?;\nWhich regions of protoplanetary discs can support the existence of vortices?;\nWhat are the lifetimes of vortices in protoplanetary discs?\n\nA number of hydrodynamic instabilities have been suggested as vortex formation\nmechanisms. The Rossby wave instability \\citep[RWI;][]{Lovelace99,Li2000,Li2001} has been shown to\nproduce large scale vortices from an initial axisymmetric state when { {a\nnon self-gravitating disc has a sufficiently strong local\nminimum in the potential vorticity \\citep{Umurhan2010,Lovelace2013,Yellin-Bergovoy_etal_2015}}}. \nThe extremum can be due to a local maximum in\nsurface density, such as can appear at the edge of the dead zone where a sharp\nchange in effective disc viscosity arises \\citep[e.g.][]{Varniere2006}, or because\na planet opens a gap in the disc \\citep{devalborro2007}.\nAnother way to produce vortices is through baroclinic instability.\n\\citet{Klahr2003} introduced the concept of the global baroclinic instability (GBI),\nand suggested that a disc with a global negative entropy gradient could form vortices.\nMore recently, \\citet{Petersen2007a} and \\citet{Petersen2007b} have shown that vortices can form when \nthe disc has an unstable radial stratification and undergoes thermal relaxation (or `cooling').\n\\citet{Lesur2010} showed in their study that this instability is actually a nonlinear \ninstability (requiring finite amplitude perturbations to be activated) and called it the \nsubcritical baroclinic instability (SBI). The nonlinearity of the instability means that\nthe finite amplitude perturbations need to be generated by another unspecified process.\nA linear instability that has been suggested as a possible source for these perturbations\nis the `convective overstability', in which the growth of epicyclic oscillations is \npowered by the same unstable stratification and thermal relaxation required for the \nsubcritical instability, leading to the formation of long-lived vortices \\citep{KlahrHubbard2014,\nLyra2014}. Finally, there have been recent suggestions that a zombie vortex instability\nmay arise in stably stratified flows by the formation of a critical layer \nwhich rolls up into vortices, which then excite new critical layers and\nvortices, leading eventually to space filling turbulence that is dominated\nby large vortices \\citep{Marcus2013b, Marcus2015}.\n\nIn this paper, we examine the possibility that vortices may be formed by\nthe vertical shear instability (VSI). This is a linear instability that was first\nstudied by \\citet{GoldreichSchubert1967} and \\citet{Fricke1968} in the\ncontext of differentially rotating stars. The presence of vertical shear\nin protoplanetary discs must arise when there is a radial temperature\ngradient, and this can lead to the destabilization of inertial-gravity waves\n(oscillations for which rotation and buoyancy provide restoring forces)\nwhen thermal time-scales are shorter than viscous time-scales, and\nare of the order of, or shorter than, dynamical time-scales \\citep{UrpinBrandenburg1998,\nUrpin2003, Nelson2013, BarkerLatter2015, Umurhan2015}. The recent \nstudy by \\citet{Nelson2013} adopted simple\nequations of state and cooling prescriptions, and showed that this \ninstability can lead to sustained hydrodynamic turbulence with a Shakura Sunyaev \nangular momentum transport parameter $\\alpha \\sim10^{-3}$ for very short cooling times.\n\\citet{StollKley2014} performed non-linear hydrodynamic simulations with radiation transport\nand showed that the instability operates in the presence of a more complete description of the\ngas thermal evolution, albeit with a reduced efficiency of\nangular momentum transport. The requirement for very short cooling times suggests \nthat this instability is most likely to operate in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs beyond\n$\\sim 10$ au \\citep{ Nelson2013,Umurhan2013}.\nAn analysis of linear growth rates in discs with energy transport in both the\noptically thick and thin regimes presented by \\citet{LinYoudin2015} suggests\nthat the VSI should operate at radii in the range 10 50 au.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect.~\\ref{sec:theory}, we review \nthe different processes and instabilities that can lead to the formation\nand destruction of vortices in discs, and in Sect.~\\ref{sec:numerics} \nwe describe the disc models that are the basis of our study and the\nnumerical scheme used in the simulations. The results of two-dimensional, \naxisymmetric simulations are presented in Sect.~\\ref{sec:2D}, and\nthe results of three-dimensional runs that examine the formation and evolution\nof vortices are presented in Sect.~\\ref{sec:3D}. Finally we discuss our results\nand draw conclusions in Sect.~\\ref{sec:discussion}\n \n\n\\section{Theoretical background and expectations}\n\\label{sec:theory}\nBefore presenting our simulation results we discuss a number of\ntheoretical results that are of relevance to this numerical study \nof the VSI.

The fact that the unstable\nVSI modes have radial wavelengths much shorter than vertical scales indicates\nthat high resolution simulations are required, leading inevitably to long \nsimulation run times. In light of this, most of the simulations presented\nin this paper adopted density and temperature power-law profiles $p=-1.5$\nand $q=-2$, where the adoption of the steep temperature profile reduces\nthe growth time scale for the VSI, hence allowing a suite of 3D simulations\nto be undertaken. We note that these disc models are stable according to\nthe Solberg-Hoiland criteria given by equations (\\ref{eqn:SH1}) and (\\ref{eqn:SH2})\nand have imaginary values of the radial Brunt-Vaisala frequency $N_R$.\nDepending on the adopted thermal relaxation time scale, these models \nmay be unstable to the SBI and the convective overstability. It is\ntherefore possible that any vorticity perturbations generated by the\nVSI may be amplified and sustained by the SBI, leading to long lived \nvortices.\n\nGiven that the parameters used for the simulations in this paper were not considered\nin the study presented by \\citet{Nelson2013}, we have undertaken a suite of 2D \naxisymmetric simulations to examine the growth times of the VSI in these models,\nand to also examine the critical cooling times that allow the VSI to operate.\nWe consider models with $h=0.2$, 0.1 and 0.05 with different thermal relaxation \ntimes.\n\nFollowing \\citet{Nelson2013}, the total kinetic energy is defined by the volume \nintegral of the sum of the radial and meridional kinetic energies, normalized by the \nvolume integral of the initial azimuthal kinetic energy:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 21706, "prevtext": "\nand we define the local disc aspect ratio $h=H/R$.\n\nIn the disc model considered here, the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the midplane is:\n\n", "index": 39, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nN_R^2={T  \\over \\gamma R^2}(p+q)(p(\\gamma-1)-q)\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E20.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N_{R}^{2}={T\\over\\gamma R^{2}}(p+q)(p(\\gamma-1)-q)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>N</mi><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mi>T</mi><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01921.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{fig1.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.05$ and different values of the cooling time.}\n\\label{2Dh=0.05}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{fig2.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.1$ and different values of the cooling time.}\n\\label{2Dh=0.1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{fig3.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.2$ and different values of the cooling time.}\n\\label{2Dh=0.2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort-034.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort-054.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort-064.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort4-034.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort4-054.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort4-064.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after 34, 54 and 64 orbital periods, \nwith $H/R=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.1$.}\n\\label{tau=0.1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe results of the 2D simulation are shown in Figs. \\ref{2Dh=0.05}, \\ref{2Dh=0.1} and \\ref{2Dh=0.2},\nwhich display the evolution of the total kinetic energy in the disc models with $h=0.05$, $0.1$ \nand $0.2$ respectively. For each value of $h$ the growth rate decreases when the cooling time \nincreases, in agreement with \\citet{Nelson2013}, and for a critical value of the cooling time\nthe disc becomes stable to the VSI. This critical value depends strongly on the scaleheight. \nFor $h=0.05$, the disc become stable for a cooling time $0.05<\\tau<0.1$, for $h=0.1$ it stabilizes\nfor $0.3<\\tau<0.5$, and for $h=0.2$ the disc remains unstable for a cooling time as large as one \norbital period.\n\nWe notice that the level of saturation also depends on the cooling time: the total kinetic \nenergy during the saturated state is higher for a shorter cooling time, and decreases for \nlonger cooling times. In other words, higher amplitude velocity and vorticity perturbations\nare expected for shorter cooling times when we consider 3D simulations below.\n\n\\section{3D simulations}\n\\label{sec:3D}\n\n\\subsection{Fiducial model}\nThe primary goal of this paper is to examine whether or not the nonlinear development of the\nVSI leads to the formation of vortices. Secondary goals include determining the range of\nconditions under which vortices form, understanding the nature of these vortices as a \nfunction of system parameters, and the possible roles of the RWI and the SBI in creating\nand maintaining vortices. Given our interest in the potential role of the SBI, we have\nchosen a disc model which in principle allows the development of the VSI and SBI.\nBoth instabilities are more efficient in thick discs, so we choose $h=0.2$. \nOur 2D runs described in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicate that this model remains unstable to the \nVSI even for relatively long cooling times, which are necessary for the SBI to operate \n\\citep{Lesur2010}.\n\nOur fiducial model has a thermal relaxation time $\\tau=0.1$ local orbits. The 2D simulations\ndescribed in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicate that the growth rate of the VSI should be quite large\nin this case, and that this cooling time is significantly shorter than the critical value \nfor which the VSI no longer operates.\nDuring the early phases the VSI in 3D remains axisymmetric and so develops very similarly \nto 2D simulations \\citep{Nelson2013}. The axisymmetric velocity perturbations correspond\nnaturally to axisymmetric vorticity perturbations which grow with time. When these axisymmetric \nvorticity bands reach a critical amplitude, they tend to destabilize and vortices are formed.\nThis evolution is illustrated by Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} which shows contours of the perturbed\nvertical component of the vorticity in the midplane (top panels) and in a slice along\nthe meridional plane (bottom panels). As discussed in \\citet{Nelson2013}, the VSI is\nfirst observed at high latitudes in the disc and descends down towards the midplane,\nas seen in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1}. \n\nThe bottom panels of Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} also show that the \nbreak-up of the initially axisymmetric vorticity\nperturbations into discrete vortices produces structures with relatively small length scales\nin the vertical direction. In other words, the vortices formed in this simulation are not\nlarge scale columnar structures, but instead appear to be coherent over vertical length scales\nthat are significantly shorter than the vertical scaleheight (i.e $\\sim 0.1 H$). \nAlthough we only plot the vorticity in the disc midplane, we find that vortices form at \nall heights in the disc.\n\nLooking in particular at the first and last of the top panels in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1}, we see \nthat the vortices have relatively small aspect ratios when projected in the $R$-$\\phi$ plane. \nDetailed measurements indicate that the \naspect ratio $\\chi \\sim 2$ for these vortices. As expected from our discussion of the elliptical\ninstability presented in Section~\\ref{sect:Elliptical}, these vortices do not survive for very long, \nand we measure a typical life time of between 2 and 3 orbits. Inspection of animations of the midplane \nvorticity indicates that this disc model develops a vigorous turbulent flow in which vortices \ncontinuously appear and disappear on time-scales of a few orbits.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/L_h=02_tau=01.png}\n\\caption{Profiles of the quantity ${\\mathcal L}$ demonstrating the\ndevelopment of extrema in this quantity and hence the conditions\nrequired for the RWI to operate and form vortices.}\n\\label{fig:L-RWI}\n\\end{figure}\n\nExamination of Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} indicates that the formation mechanism of the vortices\nis the creation of narrow, axisymmetric vorticity perturbations that then break up into discrete\nvortices when the perturbation amplitude becomes large enough. \nFrom our discussion of the\nRWI in Section~\\ref{sect:RWI}, we can see that perturbations to the vertical component of \nthe vorticity that are narrowly confined in radius correspond to the creation of extrema in \nthe quantity ${\\mathcal L}$ defined by equation~(\\ref{eqn:RWI}). As such, it appears \nthat vortices form in \nthis simulation because the VSI generates narrow vorticity perturbations and extrema in \n${\\mathcal L}$ that destabilize through the RWI. The SBI does not appear to play an \nimportant role in this particular simulation.\n\\par\n{{\nRegarding the mechanism of roll-up observed in our simulations, \nthe axisymmetric VSI is accompanied by radial\nazimuthally symmetric pressure perturbations which\ninduces jets in the zonal (azimuthal) direction.  Such jets are \ncharacterized by narrow abutting azimuthal strips of positive/negative vertical vorticity\n(recall vorticity anomalies are here understood to be with respect to the background Keplerian\nframe).  When the amplitude of the jet gets large enough, the RWI induces \nthe roll-up of the negative vorticity strip\nleaving the positive vorticity strip more or less intact since \npositive vorticity anomalies in non self-gravitating discs are stable\nto the RWI \\citep{Umurhan2010}.  \nAn examination of the top row of Fig.s in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} shows exactly\nthis pattern, where the negative vorticity anomalies created by the VSI eventually roll up into\nlocalized vorticity while leaving the positive vorticity strips alone.\nThe profile of ${\\mathcal L}$ at different \ntimes during this simulation is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:L-RWI}, illustrating the development\nof the secondary RWI as caused by the VSI throughout many stages\nand radial locations of the simulation. }}\n\n\n\\subsection{Dependence on viscosity}\n\nIn this section we investigate the role of viscosity in the \ndevelopment of the instability.\nWe have performed several simulations using the same disc model \ndescribed in the previous section, but adding viscous stresses \nand varying the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$.\nFig. \\ref{viscosity_grow} shows the growth of the instability for \ndifferent values of $\\nu$.\nAs expected, it shows that the viscosity has a stabilizing effect \non the VSI. The growth rate increases when the viscosity decreases \nuntil $\\nu=2.5 \\times 10^{-8}$, for which the behaviour is close to the \ninviscid case.\nA large viscosity totally inhibits the development of the VSI.\nThe vorticity contours for the different viscosities are plotted \nin Fig. \\ref{viscosity_profile} after simulation run times of\n26 orbits. For $\\nu=2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ the flow is still axisymmetric \nand the vortices have not yet formed, while for the lower viscosity \n($\\nu=2.5 \\times 10^{-8}$) the vorticity profile is very similar to the \ninviscid case. This suggests that the numerical diffusion is of\nthe order of $10^{-8}$. This value correspond to a Reynolds number \n$Re=Hc_s/\\nu\\approx 10^6$ and a Shakura-Sunyaev viscous stress \nparameter $\\alpha=2.5\\times 10^{-7}$ \\citep{Shakura73}.\nThis value is too small to be responsible of the short lifetimes of \nthe vortices, so we are  confident that the disappearance of the \nvortices has a physical origin rather than a numerical one.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{viscosity.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.2$, $\\tau=0.1$ and different viscosity.}\n\\label{viscosity_grow}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=25_10-6.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=25_10-7.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=25_10-8.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=0.png}\n\\caption{Vorticity in the midplane after 26 orbits and for $\\nu=2.5~\\times~ 10^{-6}$, $2.5~\\times~ 10^{-7}$, $2.5 ~\\times~10^{-8}$ and $0$.}\n\\label{viscosity_profile}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort-033.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort-041.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort-074.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort4-rz-033.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort4-rz-041.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort4-rz-074.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity contours in the midplane and meridional plane after 33, 41 and 74 orbital periods, \nwith $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.05$.}\n\\label{tau=0.05}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-201.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-317.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-401.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-rz-201.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-rz-317.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-rz-401.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after 201, 317 and 401 orbital periods, \nwith $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.5$.}\n\\label{tau=0.5}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Dependence on cooling time}\n\\label{sect:cool-time}\nIn this section, we investigate how vortex formation depends on the thermal relaxation\nby considering the cooling times $\\tau=0.05$ and $0.5$, while keeping all\nother disc parameters the same. Inspection of Fig.~\\ref{2Dh=0.2} shows that\nthe $\\tau=0.05$ run should lead to rapid growth of the VSI, and the generation\nof relatively large velocity of vorticity perturbations. A cooling time of\n$\\tau=0.5$ should lead to a longer growth time for the VSI and weaker velocity and\nvorticity perturbations.\n\nFig. \\ref{tau=0.05} shows contours of the vertical vorticity perturbations for the\n$\\tau=0.05$ run. Comparing the spectrum bars for the contours shown in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1}\nand \\ref{tau=0.05} shows that the latter run generates significantly larger vorticity \nperturbations. The consequence of this is that the vortices formed in the nonlinear\nsaturated state of this simulation have smaller aspect ratios, $\\chi$, and shorter\nlifetimes. Close inspection of the top panels in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.05} and of\nsequences of snapshots similar to these panels indicates that $\\chi\\sim 1.5$ for\nthis run, with vortex lifetimes being approximately one orbit.\n\nFig.~\\ref{tau=0.5} show the results of the simulations with $\\tau=0.5$.\nInspection of the spectrum bar that indicates the amplitude of the vorticity\nperturbations shows that this run produces significantly weaker vorticity \nperturbations than the runs with $\\tau=0.1$ and 0.05. \nConsequently, the nature of the flow is very different in this case,\nconsisting of elongated and long-lived vortices. We estimate that the\ntypical vortex aspect ratio in this run is $\\chi \\sim 6$ and the \naverage life time exceeds the simulation run times. Close inspection\nof the vortices indicates that they maintain a turbulent core\nthroughout the evolution, presumably due to the elliptical instability \noperating in this case. The long-lived nature of these vortices suggests\nthat their survival is due to the action of the SBI, that\ncontinuously attempts to increase the amplitude of the vortices in\nopposition to the elliptical instability which attempts to destroy them.\nNote, however, that this statement is somewhat speculative\nsince we may not be able to fully resolve the elliptical instability\nin this case.\n\nExamining the vertical structure of the vortices in this case, we note that\nthey occupy a greater height in the disc than those observed in the runs\nwith $\\tau=0.1$ and 0.05. The vortices shown in the upper panels of\nFig.~\\ref{tau=0.5} extend above and below the midplane by approximately\none scaleheight. \n\nIn summary, we find that the VSI gives rise to relatively large amplitude \naxisymmetric vorticity perturbations when the cooling time is short \n(i.e. $\\tau \\le 0.1$ orbits), and this leads to the formation of small \naspect ratio ($\\chi \\le 2$) vortices that form through the RWI \nand which extend only a small distance in height (approximately 10\\% of\nthe local scaleheight). The\nlifetimes of these vortices is found to be very short, being of the\norder of a few orbital periods. A longer cooling time of $\\tau=0.5$ orbits \ngives rise to lower amplitude vorticity perturbations, leading to the formation\nof elongated (i.e. $\\chi \\sim 6$) vortices that extend in height by approximately\n2 scaleheights and have lifetimes that exceed the\nsimulation run times. These vortices are observed to have turbulent cores,\npresumably due to the elliptical instability, suggesting that their long\nlifetimes are due to the action of the SBI maintaining the integrity\nof these structures. Table \\ref{Tab1} summarize the growth rate of the instability and the vorticity and the aspect ratio of the resulting vortices for each simulations.\n \n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nCooling time & Growth rate      & Vorticity         & Vortex aspect ratio \\\\\n(orbits)     &  (orbits)$^{-1}$ & $\\omega_z/\\Omega$ &      \\\\\n\\hline\n0.5 & 0.31 & -0.3 & 6 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.9 & -1.1 & 2 \\\\\n0.05 & 1.7 & -3 & 1.5\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{\\label{Tab1} Results for the $h=0.2$, $q=-2$, $p=-1.5$ simulations.\nFirst column shows cooling time, second column shows growth rate of the VSI,\nthird column shows peak vorticity\nperturbation (in units of the local orbital angular velocity), \nand fourth column shows mean aspect ratio of the emerging vortices.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Dependence on scaleheight}\nIn the previous simulations the scaleheight was set to $h=0.2$, which corresponds to a rather \nthick disc that may be unrealistic for a typical protoplanetary disc. Here, we investigate the \nevolution of two thinner disc models. As shown in Section \\ref{sec:2D}, for thinner discs we need \nshorter cooling times to trigger the VSI. We present a simulation with $h=0.1$ and $\\tau=0.2$.\nInspection of the results described in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicates that the growth time of\nthe VSI in this case will be quite long as the cooling time is relatively close to the critical\nvalue for which the VSI switches off. Thus, we might reasonably expect behaviour that is similar \nto that shown by the run with $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.5$ in this case. We also present a simulation\nwith $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$. The results presented in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicate that this\nmodel should experience rapid growth of the VSI as the cooling time is much shorter than the\ncritical thermal relaxation time scale. We might reasonably expect results similar to those\nobserved for the runs with $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.1$ and 0.05 in this case. In order to resolve\nthe smaller length scale features expected in this run the simulation was conducted with\ndouble the resolution in the radial direction.\n\nThe results of the simulation with $h=0.1$ and $\\tau=0.2$ are shown in Fig.~\\ref{h=0.1}.\nAs expected, the growth time of the instability is long in this case and the vorticity\nperturbations that arise are of relatively low amplitude. The vortices that form are\nobserved to have aspect ratios $\\chi \\sim 10$, smooth non-turbulent cores,\nand lifetimes that exceed the simulation run time of 695 orbits. The vertical heights of \nthe vortices formed near the disc midplane again appear to extend approximately plus-and-minus \none scaleheight about the midplane, as observed for the long-lived vortices formed\nin the run with $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.5$.\n\nThe results for the simulation with $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$ are shown in \nFig.~\\ref{h=0.05}. The short growth time of the VSI leads to the formation of\nvortices with small aspect ratios $\\chi \\sim 1.5$ with lifetimes of the order\nof one orbital period.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.1/vort-331.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.1/vort-555.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.1/vort-694.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=65mm]{h=0.1/vort-rz2-331.png}\n\\hspace{0mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=65mm]{h=0.1/vort-rz2-555.png}\n\\hspace{0mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=65mm]{h=0.1/vort-rz2-694.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n331, 555 and 694 orbital periods, with $h=0.1$ and $\\tau=0.2$.}\n\\label{h=0.1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-100.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-120.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-130.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-rz-100.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-rz-120.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-rz-130.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n100, 120 and 130 orbital periods, with $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$.}\n\\label{h=0.05}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Positive entropy gradient}\nOne of the original goals of this paper was to see if the VSI could produce strong\nenough vorticity perturbations to trigger the SBI. In their study of vortex growth\nin astrophysical discs, \\citet{Petersen2007a} showed that vortices can form in the \npresence of applied cooling, whether or not the radial entropy stratification was stable \nor unstable. They also showed that vortices are amplified and maintained over long time \nscales when the stratification is unstable, but decay when the stratification is stable.\nThey found that vortex amplification is more efficient for short cooling time, but vortex \nformation through the SBI is more efficient if the cooling time is long.\n\nIn the previous simulations, we observed the formation of vortices even for cooling \ntimes as short as $\\tau=0.01$. As discussed earlier in the paper, vortices appear \nto form from the axisymmetric perturbations to the vorticity that are generated \nby the VSI, indicating that vortex formation occurs as a secondary process driven \nby the RWI acting on the perturbations generated by the VSI. This suggests that the\nSBI is not responsible for vortex formation, but may nonetheless play a role in\namplifying and maintaining long lived vortices in the flow if appropriate conditions\nare present in the disc.\n\nIn an attempt to clarify this point, we present two simulations that have either a \npositive or negative midplane entropy gradient, respectively. The model with a positive \nentropy gradient has disc parameters $h=0.2$, $q=-1$, $p=-3$ and $\\tau=0.1$\n(note the shallower temperature profile). \nFig. \\ref{peg} shows the evolution of the vorticity in this simulation.\nThe results of this run are very similar to those described earlier in the\npaper (which all had negative entropy gradients in the midplane): the VSI develops \naxisymmetrically, and vortices are formed from the band of perturbed vorticity that\nis created by the VSI. We find that these vortices have quite large aspect ratios\n($\\chi \\sim 8$), but the vortex lifetimes measured in the simulation are typically\nin the range 15--20 orbital periods, considerably shorter than those measured\nin the runs discussed earlier in this paper where large aspect ratio vortices \nwere formed. \n\nThe simulation with a negative midplane entropy gradient that was run to compare with \nthe previous run with positive entropy gradient had identical parameters \n($h=0.2$, $q=-1$, $\\tau=0.1$) except\nfor the midplane density power law which was set to $p=-2$. \\citet{Nelson2013} \nshowed that the density power law index makes essentially no difference to the\ngrowth rate of the VSI, so we expect the VSI to develop in much the same way during\nthe early stages of these two runs. This is exactly what we observe, and in fact the\nlong term outcome of the simulation is very similar to the one with positive entropy\ngradient: vortices with aspect ratios $\\chi \\sim 8$ are formed, and these live for\napproximately 15 orbital periods before dissolving into that background flow.\nThis result indicates that for this particular set of disc parameters, the SBI has\nessentially no influence on the formation or amplification of vortices.\n\nThe results obtained in this section are somewhat puzzling as it is to be expected\nthat the SBI should cause the amplification of the vortices that are formed by\nthe VSI. Furthermore, the run described earlier in Section~\\ref{sect:cool-time}\nwith $h=0.2$, $p=-1.5$, $q=-2$ and $\\tau=0.5$ showed evidence that vortices formed \nby the VSI were maintained against decay by the action of the SBI. In order to explore \nthis issue further, we allowed\nthe simulation with negative entropy gradient described earlier in this section\nto evolve until it had reached a saturated state, and we then restarted it with \nlonger cooling times (both $\\tau=0.5$ and $\\tau=1$). In both cases we observed that\nthe vortices decayed and the VSI stopped operating, such that the disc evolved\ntowards a laminar state. This suggests that either the cooling time scale needs to\nbe fine-tuned in order to observe the SBI in this model, or perhaps a more likely\nexplanation is that the disc model with $h=0.2$, $p=-1.5$, $q=-2$ and\n$\\tau=0.5$ has a steeper entropy gradient which allows the SBI to operate more\nstrongly in that disc, whereas in a disc with weaker entropy gradient the SBI\nat best operates very weakly and has little influence on the formation and\nlifetimes of vortices.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{n2<0/vort3-207.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{n2<0/vort3-237.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{n2<0/vort3-295.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=60mm]{n2<0/vort3-rz-207.png}\n\\hspace{20mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=60mm]{n2<0/vort3-rz-237.png}\n\\hspace{20mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=60mm]{n2<0/vort3-rz-295.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n207, 237 and 295 orbital periods, in a disc with a positive entropy gradient in the midplane.}\n\\label{peg}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Disc with more realistic density and temperature profiles}\nIn this section, we investigate what might be thought of as a disc \nwith a more realistic density and temperature profile than the\nprevious models. We adopt $p=-1.5$, $q=-1$, $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$. \n\nIn the previous simulations the parameters of the disc were chosen to\nfavour rapid growth of the instability. The temperature power law was set \nto $q=-2$ because the growth rate of the VSI is proportional to $|q|$,\nand it gives a strong negative entropy gradient in the midplane.\nThe scaleheight was set to $h=0.2$ to obtain faster growth of the \nVSI and to increase the entropy gradient. These parameters also\nlead to a disc that is unstable to the VSI with a cooling time \nthat is long enough to also allow the development of the SBI.\nOur previous simulations, however, show that vortices more likely\nform due to the RWI rather than the SBI, so a strong entropy gradient\nand long cooling time is not necessary to form vortices.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{realistic_disc/vort2-198.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{realistic_disc/vort2-254.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{realistic_disc/vort2-291.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=55mm]{realistic_disc/vort-rz-198.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=55mm]{realistic_disc/vort-rz-254.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=55mm]{realistic_disc/vort-rz-291.png}\\\\\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n198, 254 and 291 orbital periods, with $H/R=0.05$, $q=-1$ and $\\tau=0.01$.}\n\\label{rd}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFig. \\ref{rd} shows the result of the simulation with $h=0.05$, $p=-1.5$, $q=-1$ \nand $\\tau=0.01$. As for the previous simulations with a thin disc, the radial \nresolution is doubled from $N_r=500$ to $N_r=1000$.\nAs usual, the VSI develops axisymmetrically. When the rings of vorticity destabilize, \nthey give rise to vortices that survive for approximately two orbits and the disc\ndisplays small scale turbulence. This turbulence tends to decay and after a few orbits\nthe disc relaminarizes. \nThen new VSI modes start to grow, and the process resumes, resulting in intermittent \nbehaviour in which turbulence and small scale vortices regularly appear and disappear.\n\n\\subsection{Transport properties}\n\nWe now investigate the accretion rate resulting from the turbulence generated by the VSI.\nWe defined the Reynolds stress through:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 24807, "prevtext": "\nthen the radial stratification is stable when $q<p(\\gamma-1)$ and unstable otherwise.\n\nThese equations are solved in spherical coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$\nusing a finite volume code using the MUSCL Hancok method \\citep{Richard2013}\nWe choose reflecting boundary conditions at the radial and vertical\nboundaries because of their ease of implementation, and because \n\\citet{Nelson2013} have shown that the boundary conditions appear to have no \neffect on the development of the VSI.\n\nThe computational domains of our simulations are as follows.

The fact that the unstable\nVSI modes have radial wavelengths much shorter than vertical scales indicates\nthat high resolution simulations are required, leading inevitably to long \nsimulation run times. In light of this, most of the simulations presented\nin this paper adopted density and temperature power-law profiles $p=-1.5$\nand $q=-2$, where the adoption of the steep temperature profile reduces\nthe growth time scale for the VSI, hence allowing a suite of 3D simulations\nto be undertaken. We note that these disc models are stable according to\nthe Solberg-Hoiland criteria given by equations (\\ref{eqn:SH1}) and (\\ref{eqn:SH2})\nand have imaginary values of the radial Brunt-Vaisala frequency $N_R$.\nDepending on the adopted thermal relaxation time scale, these models \nmay be unstable to the SBI and the convective overstability. It is\ntherefore possible that any vorticity perturbations generated by the\nVSI may be amplified and sustained by the SBI, leading to long lived \nvortices.\n\nGiven that the parameters used for the simulations in this paper were not considered\nin the study presented by \\citet{Nelson2013}, we have undertaken a suite of 2D \naxisymmetric simulations to examine the growth times of the VSI in these models,\nand to also examine the critical cooling times that allow the VSI to operate.\nWe consider models with $h=0.2$, 0.1 and 0.05 with different thermal relaxation \ntimes.\n\nFollowing \\citet{Nelson2013}, the total kinetic energy is defined by the volume \nintegral of the sum of the radial and meridional kinetic energies, normalized by the \nvolume integral of the initial azimuthal kinetic energy:\n\n\n", "index": 41, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nEc={\\int_V \\rho (v_{\\theta}^2 +v_{r}^2)dV \\over \\int_V \\rho v_{\\phi_0}^2dV}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E21.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"Ec={\\int_{V}\\rho(v_{\\theta}^{2}+v_{r}^{2})dV\\over\\int_{V}\\rho v_{\\phi_{0}}^{2}dV}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mi>V</mi></msub><mrow><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>\u03b8</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mi>V</mi></msub><mrow><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>v</mi><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mn>2</mn></msubsup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01921.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\delta v_r$ and $\\delta v_\\phi$ correspond to the local radial and azimuthal \nvelocity fluctuations:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\delta v_r & = & v_r-\\langle v_r\\rangle_\\phi  \\nonumber \\\\\n\\delta v_\\phi& = & v_\\phi-\\langle v_\\phi\\rangle_\\phi.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe local stress parameter $\\alpha$ is obtained by dividing the Reynolds stress \nby the density-weighted mean pressure :\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 50851, "prevtext": "\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{fig1.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.05$ and different values of the cooling time.}\n\\label{2Dh=0.05}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{fig2.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.1$ and different values of the cooling time.}\n\\label{2Dh=0.1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{fig3.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.2$ and different values of the cooling time.}\n\\label{2Dh=0.2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort-034.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort-054.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort-064.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort4-034.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort4-054.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/vort4-064.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after 34, 54 and 64 orbital periods, \nwith $H/R=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.1$.}\n\\label{tau=0.1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe results of the 2D simulation are shown in Figs. \\ref{2Dh=0.05}, \\ref{2Dh=0.1} and \\ref{2Dh=0.2},\nwhich display the evolution of the total kinetic energy in the disc models with $h=0.05$, $0.1$ \nand $0.2$ respectively. For each value of $h$ the growth rate decreases when the cooling time \nincreases, in agreement with \\citet{Nelson2013}, and for a critical value of the cooling time\nthe disc becomes stable to the VSI. This critical value depends strongly on the scaleheight. \nFor $h=0.05$, the disc become stable for a cooling time $0.05<\\tau<0.1$, for $h=0.1$ it stabilizes\nfor $0.3<\\tau<0.5$, and for $h=0.2$ the disc remains unstable for a cooling time as large as one \norbital period.\n\nWe notice that the level of saturation also depends on the cooling time: the total kinetic \nenergy during the saturated state is higher for a shorter cooling time, and decreases for \nlonger cooling times. In other words, higher amplitude velocity and vorticity perturbations\nare expected for shorter cooling times when we consider 3D simulations below.\n\n\\section{3D simulations}\n\\label{sec:3D}\n\n\\subsection{Fiducial model}\nThe primary goal of this paper is to examine whether or not the nonlinear development of the\nVSI leads to the formation of vortices. Secondary goals include determining the range of\nconditions under which vortices form, understanding the nature of these vortices as a \nfunction of system parameters, and the possible roles of the RWI and the SBI in creating\nand maintaining vortices. Given our interest in the potential role of the SBI, we have\nchosen a disc model which in principle allows the development of the VSI and SBI.\nBoth instabilities are more efficient in thick discs, so we choose $h=0.2$. \nOur 2D runs described in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicate that this model remains unstable to the \nVSI even for relatively long cooling times, which are necessary for the SBI to operate \n\\citep{Lesur2010}.\n\nOur fiducial model has a thermal relaxation time $\\tau=0.1$ local orbits. The 2D simulations\ndescribed in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicate that the growth rate of the VSI should be quite large\nin this case, and that this cooling time is significantly shorter than the critical value \nfor which the VSI no longer operates.\nDuring the early phases the VSI in 3D remains axisymmetric and so develops very similarly \nto 2D simulations \\citep{Nelson2013}. The axisymmetric velocity perturbations correspond\nnaturally to axisymmetric vorticity perturbations which grow with time. When these axisymmetric \nvorticity bands reach a critical amplitude, they tend to destabilize and vortices are formed.\nThis evolution is illustrated by Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} which shows contours of the perturbed\nvertical component of the vorticity in the midplane (top panels) and in a slice along\nthe meridional plane (bottom panels). As discussed in \\citet{Nelson2013}, the VSI is\nfirst observed at high latitudes in the disc and descends down towards the midplane,\nas seen in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1}. \n\nThe bottom panels of Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} also show that the \nbreak-up of the initially axisymmetric vorticity\nperturbations into discrete vortices produces structures with relatively small length scales\nin the vertical direction. In other words, the vortices formed in this simulation are not\nlarge scale columnar structures, but instead appear to be coherent over vertical length scales\nthat are significantly shorter than the vertical scaleheight (i.e $\\sim 0.1 H$). \nAlthough we only plot the vorticity in the disc midplane, we find that vortices form at \nall heights in the disc.\n\nLooking in particular at the first and last of the top panels in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1}, we see \nthat the vortices have relatively small aspect ratios when projected in the $R$-$\\phi$ plane. \nDetailed measurements indicate that the \naspect ratio $\\chi \\sim 2$ for these vortices. As expected from our discussion of the elliptical\ninstability presented in Section~\\ref{sect:Elliptical}, these vortices do not survive for very long, \nand we measure a typical life time of between 2 and 3 orbits. Inspection of animations of the midplane \nvorticity indicates that this disc model develops a vigorous turbulent flow in which vortices \ncontinuously appear and disappear on time-scales of a few orbits.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.1/L_h=02_tau=01.png}\n\\caption{Profiles of the quantity ${\\mathcal L}$ demonstrating the\ndevelopment of extrema in this quantity and hence the conditions\nrequired for the RWI to operate and form vortices.}\n\\label{fig:L-RWI}\n\\end{figure}\n\nExamination of Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} indicates that the formation mechanism of the vortices\nis the creation of narrow, axisymmetric vorticity perturbations that then break up into discrete\nvortices when the perturbation amplitude becomes large enough. \nFrom our discussion of the\nRWI in Section~\\ref{sect:RWI}, we can see that perturbations to the vertical component of \nthe vorticity that are narrowly confined in radius correspond to the creation of extrema in \nthe quantity ${\\mathcal L}$ defined by equation~(\\ref{eqn:RWI}). As such, it appears \nthat vortices form in \nthis simulation because the VSI generates narrow vorticity perturbations and extrema in \n${\\mathcal L}$ that destabilize through the RWI. The SBI does not appear to play an \nimportant role in this particular simulation.\n\\par\n{{\nRegarding the mechanism of roll-up observed in our simulations, \nthe axisymmetric VSI is accompanied by radial\nazimuthally symmetric pressure perturbations which\ninduces jets in the zonal (azimuthal) direction.  Such jets are \ncharacterized by narrow abutting azimuthal strips of positive/negative vertical vorticity\n(recall vorticity anomalies are here understood to be with respect to the background Keplerian\nframe).  When the amplitude of the jet gets large enough, the RWI induces \nthe roll-up of the negative vorticity strip\nleaving the positive vorticity strip more or less intact since \npositive vorticity anomalies in non self-gravitating discs are stable\nto the RWI \\citep{Umurhan2010}.  \nAn examination of the top row of Fig.s in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1} shows exactly\nthis pattern, where the negative vorticity anomalies created by the VSI eventually roll up into\nlocalized vorticity while leaving the positive vorticity strips alone.\nThe profile of ${\\mathcal L}$ at different \ntimes during this simulation is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:L-RWI}, illustrating the development\nof the secondary RWI as caused by the VSI throughout many stages\nand radial locations of the simulation. }}\n\n\n\\subsection{Dependence on viscosity}\n\nIn this section we investigate the role of viscosity in the \ndevelopment of the instability.\nWe have performed several simulations using the same disc model \ndescribed in the previous section, but adding viscous stresses \nand varying the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$.\nFig. \\ref{viscosity_grow} shows the growth of the instability for \ndifferent values of $\\nu$.\nAs expected, it shows that the viscosity has a stabilizing effect \non the VSI. The growth rate increases when the viscosity decreases \nuntil $\\nu=2.5 \\times 10^{-8}$, for which the behaviour is close to the \ninviscid case.\nA large viscosity totally inhibits the development of the VSI.\nThe vorticity contours for the different viscosities are plotted \nin Fig. \\ref{viscosity_profile} after simulation run times of\n26 orbits. For $\\nu=2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ the flow is still axisymmetric \nand the vortices have not yet formed, while for the lower viscosity \n($\\nu=2.5 \\times 10^{-8}$) the vorticity profile is very similar to the \ninviscid case. This suggests that the numerical diffusion is of\nthe order of $10^{-8}$. This value correspond to a Reynolds number \n$Re=Hc_s/\\nu\\approx 10^6$ and a Shakura-Sunyaev viscous stress \nparameter $\\alpha=2.5\\times 10^{-7}$ \\citep{Shakura73}.\nThis value is too small to be responsible of the short lifetimes of \nthe vortices, so we are  confident that the disappearance of the \nvortices has a physical origin rather than a numerical one.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=84mm]{viscosity.png}\n\\caption{Kinetic energy for a disc with a $h/r=0.2$, $\\tau=0.1$ and different viscosity.}\n\\label{viscosity_grow}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=25_10-6.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=25_10-7.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=25_10-8.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=35mm]{vort2-026_nu=0.png}\n\\caption{Vorticity in the midplane after 26 orbits and for $\\nu=2.5~\\times~ 10^{-6}$, $2.5~\\times~ 10^{-7}$, $2.5 ~\\times~10^{-8}$ and $0$.}\n\\label{viscosity_profile}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort-033.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort-041.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort-074.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort4-rz-033.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort4-rz-041.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.05/vort4-rz-074.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity contours in the midplane and meridional plane after 33, 41 and 74 orbital periods, \nwith $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.05$.}\n\\label{tau=0.05}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-201.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-317.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-401.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-rz-201.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-rz-317.png}\n\\hspace{10mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=70mm]{h=0.2_tau=0.5/vort4-rz-401.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after 201, 317 and 401 orbital periods, \nwith $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.5$.}\n\\label{tau=0.5}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Dependence on cooling time}\n\\label{sect:cool-time}\nIn this section, we investigate how vortex formation depends on the thermal relaxation\nby considering the cooling times $\\tau=0.05$ and $0.5$, while keeping all\nother disc parameters the same. Inspection of Fig.~\\ref{2Dh=0.2} shows that\nthe $\\tau=0.05$ run should lead to rapid growth of the VSI, and the generation\nof relatively large velocity of vorticity perturbations. A cooling time of\n$\\tau=0.5$ should lead to a longer growth time for the VSI and weaker velocity and\nvorticity perturbations.\n\nFig. \\ref{tau=0.05} shows contours of the vertical vorticity perturbations for the\n$\\tau=0.05$ run. Comparing the spectrum bars for the contours shown in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.1}\nand \\ref{tau=0.05} shows that the latter run generates significantly larger vorticity \nperturbations. The consequence of this is that the vortices formed in the nonlinear\nsaturated state of this simulation have smaller aspect ratios, $\\chi$, and shorter\nlifetimes. Close inspection of the top panels in Fig.~\\ref{tau=0.05} and of\nsequences of snapshots similar to these panels indicates that $\\chi\\sim 1.5$ for\nthis run, with vortex lifetimes being approximately one orbit.\n\nFig.~\\ref{tau=0.5} show the results of the simulations with $\\tau=0.5$.\nInspection of the spectrum bar that indicates the amplitude of the vorticity\nperturbations shows that this run produces significantly weaker vorticity \nperturbations than the runs with $\\tau=0.1$ and 0.05. \nConsequently, the nature of the flow is very different in this case,\nconsisting of elongated and long-lived vortices. We estimate that the\ntypical vortex aspect ratio in this run is $\\chi \\sim 6$ and the \naverage life time exceeds the simulation run times. Close inspection\nof the vortices indicates that they maintain a turbulent core\nthroughout the evolution, presumably due to the elliptical instability \noperating in this case. The long-lived nature of these vortices suggests\nthat their survival is due to the action of the SBI, that\ncontinuously attempts to increase the amplitude of the vortices in\nopposition to the elliptical instability which attempts to destroy them.\nNote, however, that this statement is somewhat speculative\nsince we may not be able to fully resolve the elliptical instability\nin this case.\n\nExamining the vertical structure of the vortices in this case, we note that\nthey occupy a greater height in the disc than those observed in the runs\nwith $\\tau=0.1$ and 0.05. The vortices shown in the upper panels of\nFig.~\\ref{tau=0.5} extend above and below the midplane by approximately\none scaleheight. \n\nIn summary, we find that the VSI gives rise to relatively large amplitude \naxisymmetric vorticity perturbations when the cooling time is short \n(i.e. $\\tau \\le 0.1$ orbits), and this leads to the formation of small \naspect ratio ($\\chi \\le 2$) vortices that form through the RWI \nand which extend only a small distance in height (approximately 10\\% of\nthe local scaleheight). The\nlifetimes of these vortices is found to be very short, being of the\norder of a few orbital periods. A longer cooling time of $\\tau=0.5$ orbits \ngives rise to lower amplitude vorticity perturbations, leading to the formation\nof elongated (i.e. $\\chi \\sim 6$) vortices that extend in height by approximately\n2 scaleheights and have lifetimes that exceed the\nsimulation run times. These vortices are observed to have turbulent cores,\npresumably due to the elliptical instability, suggesting that their long\nlifetimes are due to the action of the SBI maintaining the integrity\nof these structures. Table \\ref{Tab1} summarize the growth rate of the instability and the vorticity and the aspect ratio of the resulting vortices for each simulations.\n \n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nCooling time & Growth rate      & Vorticity         & Vortex aspect ratio \\\\\n(orbits)     &  (orbits)$^{-1}$ & $\\omega_z/\\Omega$ &      \\\\\n\\hline\n0.5 & 0.31 & -0.3 & 6 \\\\\n0.1 & 0.9 & -1.1 & 2 \\\\\n0.05 & 1.7 & -3 & 1.5\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{\\label{Tab1} Results for the $h=0.2$, $q=-2$, $p=-1.5$ simulations.\nFirst column shows cooling time, second column shows growth rate of the VSI,\nthird column shows peak vorticity\nperturbation (in units of the local orbital angular velocity), \nand fourth column shows mean aspect ratio of the emerging vortices.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Dependence on scaleheight}\nIn the previous simulations the scaleheight was set to $h=0.2$, which corresponds to a rather \nthick disc that may be unrealistic for a typical protoplanetary disc. Here, we investigate the \nevolution of two thinner disc models. As shown in Section \\ref{sec:2D}, for thinner discs we need \nshorter cooling times to trigger the VSI. We present a simulation with $h=0.1$ and $\\tau=0.2$.\nInspection of the results described in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicates that the growth time of\nthe VSI in this case will be quite long as the cooling time is relatively close to the critical\nvalue for which the VSI switches off. Thus, we might reasonably expect behaviour that is similar \nto that shown by the run with $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.5$ in this case. We also present a simulation\nwith $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$. The results presented in Section~\\ref{sec:2D} indicate that this\nmodel should experience rapid growth of the VSI as the cooling time is much shorter than the\ncritical thermal relaxation time scale. We might reasonably expect results similar to those\nobserved for the runs with $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.1$ and 0.05 in this case. In order to resolve\nthe smaller length scale features expected in this run the simulation was conducted with\ndouble the resolution in the radial direction.\n\nThe results of the simulation with $h=0.1$ and $\\tau=0.2$ are shown in Fig.~\\ref{h=0.1}.\nAs expected, the growth time of the instability is long in this case and the vorticity\nperturbations that arise are of relatively low amplitude. The vortices that form are\nobserved to have aspect ratios $\\chi \\sim 10$, smooth non-turbulent cores,\nand lifetimes that exceed the simulation run time of 695 orbits. The vertical heights of \nthe vortices formed near the disc midplane again appear to extend approximately plus-and-minus \none scaleheight about the midplane, as observed for the long-lived vortices formed\nin the run with $h=0.2$ and $\\tau=0.5$.\n\nThe results for the simulation with $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$ are shown in \nFig.~\\ref{h=0.05}. The short growth time of the VSI leads to the formation of\nvortices with small aspect ratios $\\chi \\sim 1.5$ with lifetimes of the order\nof one orbital period.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.1/vort-331.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.1/vort-555.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.1/vort-694.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=65mm]{h=0.1/vort-rz2-331.png}\n\\hspace{0mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=65mm]{h=0.1/vort-rz2-555.png}\n\\hspace{0mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=65mm]{h=0.1/vort-rz2-694.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n331, 555 and 694 orbital periods, with $h=0.1$ and $\\tau=0.2$.}\n\\label{h=0.1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-100.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-120.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-130.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-rz-100.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-rz-120.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{h=0.05/vort-rz-130.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n100, 120 and 130 orbital periods, with $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$.}\n\\label{h=0.05}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Positive entropy gradient}\nOne of the original goals of this paper was to see if the VSI could produce strong\nenough vorticity perturbations to trigger the SBI. In their study of vortex growth\nin astrophysical discs, \\citet{Petersen2007a} showed that vortices can form in the \npresence of applied cooling, whether or not the radial entropy stratification was stable \nor unstable. They also showed that vortices are amplified and maintained over long time \nscales when the stratification is unstable, but decay when the stratification is stable.\nThey found that vortex amplification is more efficient for short cooling time, but vortex \nformation through the SBI is more efficient if the cooling time is long.\n\nIn the previous simulations, we observed the formation of vortices even for cooling \ntimes as short as $\\tau=0.01$. As discussed earlier in the paper, vortices appear \nto form from the axisymmetric perturbations to the vorticity that are generated \nby the VSI, indicating that vortex formation occurs as a secondary process driven \nby the RWI acting on the perturbations generated by the VSI. This suggests that the\nSBI is not responsible for vortex formation, but may nonetheless play a role in\namplifying and maintaining long lived vortices in the flow if appropriate conditions\nare present in the disc.\n\nIn an attempt to clarify this point, we present two simulations that have either a \npositive or negative midplane entropy gradient, respectively. The model with a positive \nentropy gradient has disc parameters $h=0.2$, $q=-1$, $p=-3$ and $\\tau=0.1$\n(note the shallower temperature profile). \nFig. \\ref{peg} shows the evolution of the vorticity in this simulation.\nThe results of this run are very similar to those described earlier in the\npaper (which all had negative entropy gradients in the midplane): the VSI develops \naxisymmetrically, and vortices are formed from the band of perturbed vorticity that\nis created by the VSI. We find that these vortices have quite large aspect ratios\n($\\chi \\sim 8$), but the vortex lifetimes measured in the simulation are typically\nin the range 15--20 orbital periods, considerably shorter than those measured\nin the runs discussed earlier in this paper where large aspect ratio vortices \nwere formed. \n\nThe simulation with a negative midplane entropy gradient that was run to compare with \nthe previous run with positive entropy gradient had identical parameters \n($h=0.2$, $q=-1$, $\\tau=0.1$) except\nfor the midplane density power law which was set to $p=-2$. \\citet{Nelson2013} \nshowed that the density power law index makes essentially no difference to the\ngrowth rate of the VSI, so we expect the VSI to develop in much the same way during\nthe early stages of these two runs. This is exactly what we observe, and in fact the\nlong term outcome of the simulation is very similar to the one with positive entropy\ngradient: vortices with aspect ratios $\\chi \\sim 8$ are formed, and these live for\napproximately 15 orbital periods before dissolving into that background flow.\nThis result indicates that for this particular set of disc parameters, the SBI has\nessentially no influence on the formation or amplification of vortices.\n\nThe results obtained in this section are somewhat puzzling as it is to be expected\nthat the SBI should cause the amplification of the vortices that are formed by\nthe VSI. Furthermore, the run described earlier in Section~\\ref{sect:cool-time}\nwith $h=0.2$, $p=-1.5$, $q=-2$ and $\\tau=0.5$ showed evidence that vortices formed \nby the VSI were maintained against decay by the action of the SBI. In order to explore \nthis issue further, we allowed\nthe simulation with negative entropy gradient described earlier in this section\nto evolve until it had reached a saturated state, and we then restarted it with \nlonger cooling times (both $\\tau=0.5$ and $\\tau=1$). In both cases we observed that\nthe vortices decayed and the VSI stopped operating, such that the disc evolved\ntowards a laminar state. This suggests that either the cooling time scale needs to\nbe fine-tuned in order to observe the SBI in this model, or perhaps a more likely\nexplanation is that the disc model with $h=0.2$, $p=-1.5$, $q=-2$ and\n$\\tau=0.5$ has a steeper entropy gradient which allows the SBI to operate more\nstrongly in that disc, whereas in a disc with weaker entropy gradient the SBI\nat best operates very weakly and has little influence on the formation and\nlifetimes of vortices.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{n2<0/vort3-207.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{n2<0/vort3-237.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{n2<0/vort3-295.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=60mm]{n2<0/vort3-rz-207.png}\n\\hspace{20mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=60mm]{n2<0/vort3-rz-237.png}\n\\hspace{20mm}\n\\includegraphics[height=60mm]{n2<0/vort3-rz-295.png}\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n207, 237 and 295 orbital periods, in a disc with a positive entropy gradient in the midplane.}\n\\label{peg}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\n\\subsection{Disc with more realistic density and temperature profiles}\nIn this section, we investigate what might be thought of as a disc \nwith a more realistic density and temperature profile than the\nprevious models. We adopt $p=-1.5$, $q=-1$, $h=0.05$ and $\\tau=0.01$. \n\nIn the previous simulations the parameters of the disc were chosen to\nfavour rapid growth of the instability. The temperature power law was set \nto $q=-2$ because the growth rate of the VSI is proportional to $|q|$,\nand it gives a strong negative entropy gradient in the midplane.\nThe scaleheight was set to $h=0.2$ to obtain faster growth of the \nVSI and to increase the entropy gradient. These parameters also\nlead to a disc that is unstable to the VSI with a cooling time \nthat is long enough to also allow the development of the SBI.\nOur previous simulations, however, show that vortices more likely\nform due to the RWI rather than the SBI, so a strong entropy gradient\nand long cooling time is not necessary to form vortices.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{realistic_disc/vort2-198.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{realistic_disc/vort2-254.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=50mm]{realistic_disc/vort2-291.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[height=55mm]{realistic_disc/vort-rz-198.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=55mm]{realistic_disc/vort-rz-254.png}\n\\includegraphics[height=55mm]{realistic_disc/vort-rz-291.png}\\\\\n\n\\caption{Vorticity profile in the midplane and meridional plane after \n198, 254 and 291 orbital periods, with $H/R=0.05$, $q=-1$ and $\\tau=0.01$.}\n\\label{rd}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFig. \\ref{rd} shows the result of the simulation with $h=0.05$, $p=-1.5$, $q=-1$ \nand $\\tau=0.01$. As for the previous simulations with a thin disc, the radial \nresolution is doubled from $N_r=500$ to $N_r=1000$.\nAs usual, the VSI develops axisymmetrically. When the rings of vorticity destabilize, \nthey give rise to vortices that survive for approximately two orbits and the disc\ndisplays small scale turbulence. This turbulence tends to decay and after a few orbits\nthe disc relaminarizes. \nThen new VSI modes start to grow, and the process resumes, resulting in intermittent \nbehaviour in which turbulence and small scale vortices regularly appear and disappear.\n\n\\subsection{Transport properties}\n\nWe now investigate the accretion rate resulting from the turbulence generated by the VSI.\nWe defined the Reynolds stress through:\n\n\n", "index": 43, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nT_r(r,\\theta)={1\\over \\phi_{max}} \\int_0^{\\phi_{max}} \\rho \\delta v_r \\delta v_\\phi d\\phi\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E22.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"T_{r}(r,\\theta)={1\\over\\phi_{max}}\\int_{0}^{\\phi_{max}}\\rho\\delta v_{r}\\delta v%&#10;_{\\phi}d\\phi\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msub></msubsup><mrow><mi>\u03c1</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>r</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b4</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mi>\u03d5</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01921.tex", "nexttext": "\n \n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular*}{0.45\\textwidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}  c c c c c}\n\\hline\n$\\tau$ & $h$ & $q$ & $p$ & $\\alpha$ \\\\\n\\hline\n0.05 & 0.2 & -2 & -1.5 & $2.65 \\times 10^{-4}$\\\\\n0.1 & 0.2 & -2 & -1.5 & $5.33  \\times 10^{-5}$\\\\\n0.5 & 0.2 & -2 & -1.5 & $2.8  \\times 10^{-5}$\\\\\n0.2 & 0.1 & -2 & -1.5 & $2.8  \\times 10^{-6}$\\\\\n0.01 & 0.05 & -2 & -1.5 & \\\\\n0.1 & 0.2 & -1 & -3 & $2.8  \\times 10^{-6}$\\\\\n0.1 & 0.2 & -1 & -2 & $3.5  \\times 10^{-6}$\\\\\n0.01 & 0.05 & -1 & -1.5 & \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\label{Table_alpha}\nThe first column gives the cooling time, the second column the disc aspect ratio, \nthe third and fourth columns the temperature and density power law indices, and\nthe last column gives the effective viscous stress parameter $\\alpha$ obtained in\nthe simulations.}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe volume- and time-averaged $\\alpha$ value for each simulation is listed in\nTable~\\ref{Table_alpha}, where the time average was taken over the last 20 orbits\nof each run. There is a general tendency for the Reynolds stress to decrease as\nthe cooling time increases, due to the velocity fluctuations generated by the\nVSI decreasing with increasing cooling time.\nWe also note that the simulation with $h=0.1$, which sustains smooth long-lived\nvortices in a relatively quiet background flow without strong turbulence has\nthe lowest $\\alpha$ value.\n\nWe also plot the temporal evolution of the mean $\\alpha$ value for each of the\nsimulations with $h=0.2$, $q=-2$ and $p=-1.5$ in Fig.~\\ref{alphas}.\nThe simulation with $\\tau=0.05$ is shown in the top left panel, which displays\na peak value of $\\alpha=6 \\times 10^{-4}$.

The results of these simulations may be summarized as follows.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We find that the VSI readily leads to the formation of vortices in a broad range of\ndisc models.\n\\item \n{{The formation mechanism of the vortices is the generation of axisymmetric \nvorticity perturbations by the VSI that destabilize into discrete vortices\nthrough the RWI.  Specifically speaking, the VSI generates pressure perturbations\nthat induces the formation of narrow azimuthal jets.  These jets are characterized\nby azimuthally symmetric strips of positive/negative vertical vorticity.  As a given jet grows in amplitude,\nthat side of it with the negative vorticity\nanomaly becomes unstable to the RWI\nand rolls-up into localized\nvortices while the positive anomaly remains intact since it itself is not unstable to the RWI.  \nAs a given simulation\nprogresses and the VSI reaches out to larger radii, more and more unsteady vortices are produced\neventually spreading across the totality of the computational domain.}}\n\\item For steep temperature profiles and short cooling times ($h=0.2$, $q=-2$, $\\tau \\le 0.1$ orbits)\nwe observe that vortices form with small aspect ratios ($\\chi \\le 2$) and extend in height over \nlength scales much smaller than the local scaleheight ($\\sim 0.1 H$). These vortices\nhave short lifetimes of only a few orbital periods before dissolving into the background flow,\nafter which new generations of vortices form and dissolve in a repetitive cycle.\n\\item For longer cooling times and steep temperature (and entropy) profiles\n($h=0.2$, $q=-2$, $\\tau=0.5$ orbits) we observe the formation of elongated vortices ($\\chi \\sim 6$)\nthat live for hundreds of orbits (longer than the simulation run times). These vortices\nlive with a noticeably turbulent core, indicating that there is a balance between\nthe elliptical instability try to destroy the vortex and the SBI\nmaintaining the vortex over long time-scales. This suggests that the SBI can play an\nimportant role in maintaining long lived vortices when the negative entropy profile is \nsufficiently steep. \n\\item Similar behaviour is observed for thinner discs with $h=0.1$ and 0.05 when the\ntemperature profile has a steep power law index $q=-2$.\n\\item Changing the temperature power law index to $q=-1$ results in vortices that do not\nlive for more than a few tens of orbits at most. Simulations performed with either weakly\npositive or negative entropy profiles produce very similar results, indicating that the influence\nof the SBI is significantly diminished when the entropy profile is weaker than that obtained\nwith $q=-2$. \n\\item Analysis of the volume averaged Reynolds stresses associated with the VSI\nshows that the efficiency of angular momentum transport depends strongly on \nthe thermal relaxation time scale. In line with our observation that the VSI generates \nstronger velocity fluctuations for short cooling times, we obtain an effective Shakura-Sunyaev \n$\\alpha$ value \\citep{Shakura73} of \n$\\alpha_{\\rm SS} \\sim 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ when $\\tau=0.05$ for a model with $q=-2$ and $h=0.2$.\nWhen $\\tau=0.5$ we obtain $\\alpha_{\\rm SS} \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-5}$. These values \nshould be contrasted with the value $\\alpha_{\\rm SS} \\sim 10^{-3}$ obtained by \n\\citet{Nelson2013} for a locally isothermal disc model, indicating that the inclusion\nof a finite cooling time scale significantly reduces the strength of the VSI.\nThis point has also been noted by \\citet{StollKley2014}, who performed simulations\nwith radiation transport and obtained $\\alpha_{\\rm SS} \\sim 10^{-4}$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe requirement of short cooling times for the VSI to operate indicates that\nit is most likely to be present in the outer regions of protoplanetary\ndiscs, between $\\sim$ 10 and 50 au \\citep{Nelson2013, Umurhan2013, LinYoudin2015},\nalthough the short cooling times expected at higher disc latitudes may allow it\nto also operate there at smaller stellocentric radii \\citep{LinYoudin2015}.\nThe potential role of vortices in protoplanetary discs as sites for the\ntrapping of solids and growing planets has been well documented \\citep{BargeSommeria1995},\nand it is of interest to address the question of whether or not the vortices \nformed by the VSI are likely to play an important role in planet building.\nThe main difficulty with the VSI vortices trapping solids\nis their apparent short lifetimes in the absence of a sufficiently steep\nentropy profile. To assess the expected midplane entropy profiles in protoplanetary discs,\nwe assume that the disc surface density profile may be \nwritten as $\\Sigma(R) = \\Sigma_0 R^{\\delta}$, and that the requirement for\na negative entropy gradient to exist locally at the midplane\n(such that the SBI can play some role in extending vortex lifetimes) can be \nwritten as $q+p(1-\\gamma) < 0$. Then we can examine which values of $\\delta$ \narise for reasonable values of the temperature power-law index such that the \nradial Brunt-Vaisala frequency obeys $N_R^2 < 0$. We note that the requirement \nfor $N_R^2 <0$ can be written more conveniently as $p > q/(\\gamma-1)$.\n\nThe minimum mass solar nebula model has $T(R) = 280 {\\rm K} (R/ {\\rm au})^{-1/2}$\n\\citep{Hayashi1981}. The more sophisticated passively irradiated disc model of\n\\citet{ChiangGoldreich1997} has $T(R) = 120 K (R/{\\rm au})^{-3/7}$, i.e. the \ntemperature profile is slightly shallower than the $q=-1/2$ value obtained from \nthe Hayashi model. Observational constraints in the outer regions of discs \nindicate that $-0.7 \\le q \\le -0.4$ \\citep{AndrewsWilliams2005}, covering the \ntheoretically expected range. Adopting $q=-1/2$ and $\\gamma=7/5$, we require \n$p > -5/4$ for a negative entropy gradient at the midplane. Writing \n$\\Sigma \\sim H \\rho_{\\rm mid}$, where $H$ is the scaleheight\nand $\\rho_{\\rm mid}$ is the midplane density, and using $p=-5/4$ and\n$H(R) \\propto R^{(3+q)}/2$ (from the definition $H=c_{\\rm s}/v_{\\rm k}$),\nwe see that the power law index for the surface density $\\delta=0$ for this model.\nIn other words, a disc that has $q=-1/2$ and \\emph{just} supports a large scale \nnegative entropy gradient in its outer regions must have a flat or outwardly \nincreasing surface density profile. Observations suggest that surface density\npower law values in the outer regions of discs are typically $\\delta \\sim -1$\n\\citep{WilliamsCieza2011}, such that the entropy profile is increasing and\nnot decreasing outwards. Our simulations indicate that just having\na modestly decreasing entropy profile is unlikely to be sufficient for maintaining\nlong lived vortices, and that the entropy gradient needs to be reasonably\nsteep. The above discussion suggests that the globally inferred temperature and \nsurface density profiles in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs are unlikely \nto support the existence of long-lived vortices maintained by the SBI. We note,\nhowever, that we cannot rule out the possibility that shadowing or other effects\nmay increase the temperature gradient locally such that vortices can exist as\nlong-lived structures around the midplane.  \n{{We note recent work\n studying particle\ngrowth in evolving protoplanetary discs\n\\citep{Estrada2015}\nwherein \ndiscs with complex temperature and opacity profiles are found ones\nin which the VSI is likely to be active in several localized radial\nsections, including places near to various ice lines.}}\n\\par\nWe conclude that although the VSI may operate in the outer regions of discs,\nand produce vortices, these are likely to be relatively short lived structures\nthat at best play a moderate role in trapping solids and assisting in the\nbuilding of planets. The presence of a quasi-turbulent flow arising from the VSI\nmay indeed provide a source of stirring that could act to hinder the formation\nof planetesimals and planets \\citep{Gressel2011,Gressel2012} or perhaps\nrestrict it into places in the disc where the VSI is either weak or entirely absent.\n\nHaving presented a set of idealized models with simple cooling prescriptions\nto examine the evolution of the VSI in protoplanetary discs, the next step is\nto undertake multidimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with realistic\nopacities to examine the nonlinear outcome of the VSI in more realistic disc models.\nThese calculations will be the subject of future publications.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThis work used the DiRAC Complexity system, operated by the University of Leicester\nIT Services, which forms part of the STFC DiRAC HPC Facility (www.dirac.ac.uk).\nThe equipment is funded by BIS National E-Infrastructure capital grant ST/K000373/1\nand STFC Operations grant ST/K0003259/1.
