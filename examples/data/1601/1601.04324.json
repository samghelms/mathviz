The electronic gaps are found to be very sensitive to the atomic\nstructure in these systems. We have therefore optimised the geometry of\npolyyne by directly minimising the DMC energy with respect to the lattice\nconstant and the Peierls-induced carbon--carbon bond-length alternation. We\nfind the bond-length alternation of polyyne to be $0.136(2)$ {\\AA} and the\nexcitonic and quasiparticle gaps to be $3.30(7)$ and $3.4(1)$ eV,\nrespectively.  The DMC zone-centre longitudinal optical phonon frequency of\npolyyne is $2084(5)$ cm$^{-1}$, which is consistent with Raman spectroscopic\nmeasurements for large oligoynes.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nCarbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe and is fundamental\nto life as we know it. Carbon exists in a number of strikingly different\nforms, including famous examples such as $sp^3$-bonded diamond and\ntwo-dimensional $sp^2$-bonded graphene.  A less well-known form of pure carbon\nis polyyne, which is a one-dimensional $sp$-bonded chain of carbon atoms with\nalternating single and triple bonds. The observed presence of carbon chains in\ninterstellar space and circumstellar shells \\cite{Kroto_1987,Duley_2000} has\ninspired considerable effort to synthesise polyyne in the laboratory, leading\namong other things to the discovery of fullerenes \\cite{Kroto_1985}.  Recent\nexperiments have shown that it is possible to produce a long linear chain of\nmore than $200$ carbon atoms inside a protector such as a double-walled carbon\nnanotube (DWCNT) \\cite{Shi_2015} and also to synthesise stable oligoynes\n(short polyyne molecules) with up to 44 carbon atoms \\cite{Chalifoux_2010} and\na variety of terminal groups\n\\cite{Lagow_1995,Gibtner_2002,Tsuji_2002,Matsutani_2008,Mohr_2003,Samoc_2008,Chalifoux_2011}.\nPolyyne is of particular interest as the ideal interconnect in single-molecule\nnanoelectronic circuitry, including spintronic devices\n\\cite{Crljen_2007,Standley_2008,Hong_2008,Zeng_2010}, and has potential\napplications in nanomechanical devices\n\\cite{Baughman_2006,Liu_2013,Artyukhov_2014}. Unfortunately, the\ncharacterization of the optical and electronic properties of polyyne continues\nto present many challenges. Our aim in this work is to address the source of\nexperimental and theoretical discrepancies by establishing the structural and\nelectronic properties of polyyne with quantitative accuracy.\n\nThe band gap of polyyne is strongly dependent on the bond-length alternation\n(BLA) that arises from the so-called Peierls distortion of the linear carbon\nchain \\cite{Peierls_1955}. A carbon chain has a half-filled band structure\nwith degenerate $\\pi$ orbitals; therefore a small distortion can reduce the\ntranslational symmetry and introduce gaps into the energy bands at or near the\nFermi energy, thereby lowering the total energy.  Estimating the gap of\nextended polyyne by extrapolating from the measured absorption spectra of\noligoynes has been attempted in several studies\n\\cite{Eisler_2005,Gibtner_2002,Mohr_2003,Samoc_2008,Zheng_2006,Chalifoux_2010,Dembinski_2000};\nhowever, long oligoynes are needed to minimise the effects of terminal groups,\nand the interpretation of the absorption spectra of oligoynes is not always\nstraightforward.  Most first-principles studies of the electronic structure of\npolyyne to date are based on density functional theory (DFT) with different\nexchange--correlation functionals\n\\cite{Weimer_2005,Yang_2006,Peach_2007,Zhang_2004,Imamura_2013}.  The local\ndensity approximation (LDA) and Perdew--Burke--Ernzerhof \\cite{pbe} (PBE)\nfunctionals substantially underestimate the gap.  Hybrid exchange--correlation\nfunctionals such as the Becke (three-parameter) Lee--Yang--Parr\n\\cite{Becke_1993,Lee_1998} (B3LYP) and Heyd--Scuseria--Ernzerhof\n\\cite{Heyd_2003,Heyd_2006} (HSE06) functionals, which include a fraction of\nexact exchange, perform significantly better, but the predicted gaps still\nunderestimate the range of gaps indicated by experiment\n\\cite{Dembinski_2000,Gibtner_2002,Mohr_2003,Zhuravlev_2004,Eisler_2005,Zheng_2006,Samoc_2008,Chalifoux_2010}.\nOn the other hand, Hartree--Fock (HF) theory significantly overestimates gaps.\nPost-HF quantum-chemistry methods such as M{\\o}ller--Plesset second-order\nperturbation theory (MP2) and coupled-cluster singles and doubles with\nperturbative triples [CCSD(T)] offer a different and potentially far more\naccurate theoretical approach \\cite{Abdurahman_2002}; however the gap of\npolyyne has to be obtained by extrapolating the gaps of small,\nhydrogen-terminated oligoynes to infinite chain length, introducing\nsignificant uncertainty into the results.  Previous theoretical studies have\nreported the BLA of polyyne based on HF \\cite{Abdurahman_2002,Yang_2006},\nnonhybrid DFT \\cite{Abdurahman_2002,Yang_2006}, hybrid DFT \\cite{Yang_2006},\nMP2 \\cite{Poulsen_2001,Abdurahman_2002,Yang_2006}, and CCSD(T)\n\\cite{Abdurahman_2002,Zeinalipour_2008} calculations. However, there is no\nconsensus over either the BLA or the band gap of polyyne in the literature\n\\cite{Al-backri_2014,Lambert_2015}.\n\nIn this work, we use highly accurate quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods\n\\cite{Ceperley_1980,Foulkes_2001} to calculate ground-state and excited-state\ntotal energies of isolated hydrogen-terminated oligoynes (C$_{2n}$H$_2$) and\nsupercells of polyyne subject to periodic boundary conditions.  The structure\nof polyyne is defined by just two parameters, the lattice constant and the\nBLA, enabling us to carry out a brute-force optimisation of the structure by\nminimising the QMC total energy.  To the best of our knowledge this is the\nfirst QMC study of polyyne.  We compare our data with experimental and\ntheoretical results in the literature.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organised in three sections: in Section $2$ we\ndescribe the computational methodology.  Section $3$ contains our DFT and\nQMC results for the BLA and electronic gaps of oligoynes and extended polyyne,\nincluding the vibrational renormalisation. Finally, we present our conclusions\nin Section $4$. \n\\section{Computational methodology}\n\n\\subsection{DFT calculations}\n\nOur DFT calculations were performed using the \\textsc{castep} plane-wave-basis\ncode \\cite{castep}. We relaxed the geometries of hydrogen-terminated oligoynes\nconsisting of up to twelve pairs of carbon atoms using DFT-PBE and DFT-HSE06,\nand we relaxed the geometry of extended polyyne using DFT-HSE06. The widths\nand heights of our periodic unit cells were fixed at 20 Bohr radii and, for\noligoynes, the length was varied so that a constant amount of vacuum ($20$\nBohr radii) was maintained between images of the molecule. In our DFT\ncalculations for polyyne we used a grid of 30 $k$ points.  We used ultrasoft\npseudopotentials in our DFT-PBE calculations and norm-conserving\npseudopotentials in our DFT-HSE06 calculations.  The plane-wave cutoff energy\nin our DFT geometry optimisations was 25 Ha.\n\n\\subsection{QMC calculations}\n\nFor our QMC calculations we used the variational and diffusion quantum Monte\nCarlo (VMC and DMC) methods implemented in the \\textsc{casino} code\n\\cite{Needs_2010}.  The DMC method has previously been used to study the\nexcitation energies of a variety of molecules and solids\n\\cite{Mitas_1994,Williamson_1998,Towler_2000,Williamson_2002,Drummond_2005_dia}.\nThe many-body trial wave function was composed of Slater determinants\nmultiplied by a Jastrow correlation factor \\cite{Foulkes_2001}. We used\nDFT-PBE orbitals, which were generated by \\textsc{castep} using a plane-wave\ncutoff energy of 120 Ha, and we used Dirac--Fock pseudopotentials\n\\cite{Trail_2005a,Trail_2005b}. The plane-wave orbitals were re-represented in\na blip (B-spline) basis before they were used in the QMC calculations\n\\cite{Alfe_2004}, allowing the use of aperiodic (for oligoynes) and one\ndimensionally periodic (for polyyne) boundary conditions in our QMC\ncalculations.  \n\n\\begin{table*}[!ht]\n\\small\n\\caption{Number of MD terms and orbital occupancies in each determinant for\n  the neutral ground state, singlet and triplet excited states, cationic and\n  anionic states in each of our calculations. ``H'' and ``L'' denote the HOMO\n  and LUMO, respectively.

We have therefore studied the effect of multideterminant (MD)\nSlater--Jastrow trial wave functions for excited, cationic, and anionic states\nof oligoynes with $4$, $6$, $8$, $10$, and $24$ carbon atoms as well as a\nsupercell of polyyne composed of 8 primitive cells.  The Slater determinants\nin the MD wave functions contained all the orbital occupancies that are\ndegenerate at the single-particle level. In Table \\ref{table:md_expansion} we\nspecify the occupancy of the orbitals in the determinants used in our trial\nwave functions. We used linear-least-squares energy minimisation\n\\cite{Nightinga_2001,Toulous_2007,Umrigar_2007} and unreweighted variance\nminimisation \\cite{Umrigar_1988,Drummond_2005} to optimise the MD coefficients\nand the Jastrow factor, respectively. Using variance minimisation rather than\nenergy minimisation for the Jastrow factor improves the stability of\nsubsequent DMC simulations and reduces the DMC ground-state energy of a\nC$_4$H$_2$ molecule by $0.21(7)$ eV\\@.  A test for C$_4$H$_2$ showed that the\neffects of additional determinants containing promotions to the LUMO$+2$ are\nnegligible.\n\nThe free parameters in the Jastrow factor were optimised by unreweighted\nvariance minimisation \\cite{Umrigar_1988,Drummond_2005} and the determinant\nexpansion coefficients were optimised by energy minimisation\n\\cite{Nightinga_2001,Toulous_2007,Umrigar_2007}. The DMC energy was linearly\nextrapolated to zero time step and we verified that finite-population errors\nin our results are negligible.  Fermionic antisymmetry in DMC is imposed by\nthe fixed-node approximation \\cite{Anderson_1976}, in which the nodal surface\nis pinned at that of the trial wave function.  The fixed-node approximation\nallows us to study excited states by using trial wave functions with the\nappropriate nodal topology.  Because the Jastrow factor is strictly positive,\nthe nodal topology is purely determined by the Slater determinants.\n\nTwist-averaging is less important in one-dimensional systems than two- or\nthree-dimensional systems; for example momentum quantisation in a\none-dimensional homogeneous electron gas simply introduces a smooth,\n$O(n^{-2})$ error in the energy per particle \\cite{Lee_2011}.\n\n\\subsection{DMC quasiparticle and excitonic gaps}\n\nA crucial quantity that characterises the electronic structure of polyyne is\nthe quasiparticle gap, which is the difference between the electron affinity\nand the first ionisation potential.  The quasiparticle gap is the energy\nrequired to create an unbound electron--hole pair and was computed by the DMC\nmethod \\cite{Foulkes_2001}.

When a\nsingle particle is added to a finite simulation cell subject to periodic\nboundary conditions, a periodic lattice of quasiparticles is formed.  The\nenergy of this unwanted lattice of quasiparticles goes as the Madelung\nconstant of the supercell lattice. The one dimensional Madelung energy in\nHartree atomic units ($\\hbar=m_{\\rm e}=|e|=4\\pi\\epsilon_0=1$) is given by $v_M\n= [-0.2319-2{\\rm log}(an)]/(an)$, where $a$ is the lattice constant and $n$ is\nthe number of primitive cells. Ignoring logarithmic corrections in\none-dimensional systems, the Madelung constant falls off as the reciprocal of\nthe linear size of the supercell, i.e., as $1/n$. Additional finite-size\neffects in the exciton energy arise from the fact that the energy is evaluated\nusing the Ewald interaction rather than $1/r$.  However, by calculating the\nground-state energy of an exciton modelled by a single electron and a single\nhole moving strictly in one dimension in a periodic cell as a function of cell\nlength (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:finite_exciton}), we find that these finite-size errors\nfall off more rapidly, as $1/n^3$.

We have found that simpler levels of theory, such as DFT, do not\npredict either the BLA or the gap with quantitative accuracy. Our DMC\ncalculations show the Peierls-induced BLA of polyyne to be $0.136(2)$ {\\AA},\nwhich is significantly higher than DFT predictions.  The DMC quasiparticle gap\nof extended polyyne obtained using the DMC-optimised BLA is $3.4(1)$ eV\\@.\nThe static-nucleus DMC singlet excitonic gap of polyyne is $3.30(7)$\neV\\@. Vibrational contributions reduce the gap of polyyne by about $0.1$\neV\\@.  The DMC-calculated zone-centre LO phonon frequency of polyyne is\n$2084(5)$ cm$^{-1}$, which is significantly higher than those obtained by DFT,\nbut is consistent with experimental Raman measurements.  Our work represents\nthe first direct evaluation of the structural and electronic properties of\nextended one-dimensional carbon chains using a high-accuracy method.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nWe acknowledge financial support from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council (EPSRC)\\@.

The error bars in the Monte\nCarlo results correspond to the statistical uncertainty arising from the Monte\nCarlo integration. The band-gap corrections calculated using the quadratic\nmethod are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo results. In the quadratic\nmethod, the coupling of each vibrational normal mode to the electronic band\nextrema is treated individually, hence providing access to the microscopic\nbehaviour of the system. Within DFT-PBE, the largest phonon zero-point\ncorrection to the gap is found in the shortest oligoyne considered,\nC$_4$H$_2$, at about $-0.14$ eV\\@. The correction decreases with increasing\nchain length to about $-0.05$ eV for C$_{24}$H$_2$. The decrease in the\nstrength of electron--phonon coupling with increasing chain size in oligoynes\ncan be attributed to the decrease in the importance of the hydrogen atoms at\nthe terminations. Phonon renormalisation of gaps is clearly not as important\nin oligoynes as in either benzene or diamond.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=.45\\textwidth]{zp_correction.pdf}\n\\caption{DFT-PBE zero-point correction $\\Delta_{\\rm corr}$ to the excitonic\n  gaps of oligoynes as a function of the reciprocal of the number $n$ of pairs\n  of carbon atoms.
