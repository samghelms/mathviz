In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that an accurate treatment of NSBM remnant evolution is crucial not just for detailed models of electromagnetic transients \\citep{nakar2011, rosswog2014, kelley2013, metzner2012}  but also for models of heavy element enrichment \\citep{shen2014,  tsujimoto2014, vandevoort2015}. NSBMs are thought to play a predominant role in creating \\citep{metzger2010, roberts2011, korobkin2012, bauswein2013, grossman2014, ramirez-ruiz2015,goriely2015, vangioni2016} and dispersing $r$-process elements, yet modern cosmological simulations are still  not able to resolve  the expansion of SNRs. Motivated by this, we  have perform a series of  three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of isolated NSBM remnants expanding in  environments with thermodynamical properties  similar to those found in cosmological simulations (Section~\\ref{amb}).   Particularly important is the use of realistic merger simulations \\citep{roberts2011} for constructing the  initial conditions characterizing the structure of the ejected tidal debris (Section~\\ref{hydro}).  We have centered our attention  in particular on the evolution  of NSBM\nremnants during the well-known stages  that are commonly used to describe the evolution of SNRs.  \n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item First, a free expansion phase is observed, during which the mass of the\nejecta is larger than the mass of the swept up gas. This evolutionary phase is significantly shorter than that of a typical SNR due mainly  to the low mass content of the  ejecta ($5.8\\times10^{-2}~M_\\odot$) and, to a lesser degree,  the initial complex geometry. \n\n\\item Secondly, an energy conserving phase takes place, during which radiative losses\nare negligible (Figure~\\ref{fig:3d}). During this phase the rate of mass swept up by the blast wave is reduced when compared to a standard SNR but is then subsequently  increased as the\n NSBM remnant becomes progressively more spherical.  However, radiative losses  begin to influence the  NSBM remnant evolution before it is accurately described  by a standard spherical solution (Figure~\\ref{fig:ism}).  In addition, the overall evolution takes\nslightly longer, with the cooling time reaching its  critical value only when the shock has travelled a distance that is a  few times larger than in the spherical case. This is observed in all simulations listed in Table~\\ref{ta}.  \n \n \\item Thirdly, a pressure-driven snowplow phase sets in,  during which\nradiative losses begin to influence the evolution of the NSBM remnant \nand  shell formation is found to set in at a time when the swept up mass attains a value of $M_{\\rm s}\\approx 10^3 M_\\odot$, as it is commonly found in SNRs (Table~\\ref{table:rs}).  The radius, total  swept-up mass, kinetic energy and outward radial momentum at shell formation for NSBM remnants, we conclude,  are  close to the standard  estimates given for SNRs  \\citep{cox1974, mckee1977,blondin1998, joung2006}. \n\n\\item Finally, during the momentum conserving\nphase, the evolution of a NSBM remnant  is remarkably  similar to that of a  SNR. This implies that sub-resolution supernova feedback models \\citep[e.g.][]{martizzi2015,kim2015} can be accurately used in galaxy-scale simulations that are unable to resolve the early  evolutionary stages  of  a NSBM remnant.\n \\end{itemize}\n \nWhile our simulations of NSBM remnants have confirmed the similarities and highlighted  the differences of the well-known evolutionary stages of SNRs, \none of the key distinct processes affecting their structure  is the contribution of $r$-process material to the cooling of the swept-up material.   As complete atomic line lists for these heavy species are not available \\citep{kasen2013}, \nwe have thus simply assumed that the energy integral of the full radiative spectra of $r$-process material is similar to that of Fe. Under these conditions, we find that  metal cooling from $r$-process material is not expected  to influence the dynamics  of NSBM remnants   expanding into an ambient medium with  $Z \\gtrsim 10^{-3} Z_\\odot$.  The resulting NSBM remnant evolution in these environments  should solely be determined by the metal cooling of the swept-up material. Yet,  the mass fraction of $r$-process material  at shell formation  within the remnant is expected to be severely enhanced  to about $2.5 \\times 10^4\\; (Z/ 10 ^{-2} Z_\\odot)$, assuming a solar  abundance ratio.  In contrast,  with a  total $r$-process mass per supernova of $M_{\\rm p}\\approx  7.4 \\times10^{-5} M_\\odot$ \\citep{shen2014}, we expect a local enhancement of only about $31.9 \\; (Z/ 10 ^{-2} Z_\\odot)$ when a  Type II  SNR attains shell formation.\n \nOf particular relevance  in this case are the heavy element composition of  galactic halo stars with  metallicity regime $10^{-3} Z_\\odot \\lesssim Z \\lesssim 10 ^{-2} Z_\\odot$, which have been found to have  pure $r$-process products with a distribution that is characteristic of solar system matter but with a large star-to-star scatter in their  $r$-process  concentrations \\citep{Sneden08}.  In  some stars with $Z\\approx 10 ^{-2} Z_\\odot$, the $r$-process enrichment  can be as large as $10^2$, assuming a solar  abundance ratio.  The presence of $r$-process material in these stars with a distribution that is characteristic of solar abundance ratios  illustrates  that $r$-process enrichment  has operated in a fairly robust manner, while their abundance dispersions  further  suggests  that $r$-process production sites must be rare and locally very enhanced, as expected from NSBM enrichment \\citep[e.g.][]{shen2014}.  These localized inhomogeneities would then be smoothed out as  more NSBMs take place and $r$-process material is  given more time to be transported and mixed  throughout the early Milky Way. Metal feedback from NSBM remnants  is thus essential to understand  the formation of $r$-process enhanced stars  in  galaxies. Despite the initial differences, our conclusions regarding the efficacy of the  transport and mixing of $r$-process material  by NSBM remnants  in a cosmological context should be  similar to that expected from single SNRs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\acknowledgments \nWe thank R.

If NSBM are indeed solely responsible for the solar system $r$-process\nabundances, a galaxy like our own would require to host a few NSBM  per million years, with each event ejecting, on average,\nabout $5 \\times 10^{-2}M_\\sun$ of $r$-process material.   Because the ejecta velocities in the tidal tail are significantly  larger than in ordinary supernovae, NSBM deposit  a comparable amount of energy  into the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to  extensive   efforts studying  spherical models for supernova remnant  evolution,  calculations quantifying the impact of NSBM ejecta  in the ISM have been lacking.  To better understand their  evolution in  a cosmological context, we perform a suite of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with optically-thin radiative cooling  of isolated NSBM ejecta expanding in environments with conditions adopted  from  Milky Way-like galaxy simulations.  Although the  remnant  morphology is  highly complex at early times,\nthe subsequent radiative evolution that results  from thermal instability in atomic gas  is remarkably similar to that of a standard supernova  blast wave.  This implies that sub-resolution  supernova  feedback models can be used  in galaxy-scale simulations that  are unable to  resolve the key evolutionary phases of  NSBM  blast waves.  Among other quantities, we examine the radius, time, mass and  kinetic energy content  of the NSBM remnant  at shell formation as well as  the momentum injected to the ISM. We find that the shell formation epoch is attained when the swept-up mass is about $10^3\\;M_\\odot$, at this point the mass fraction of $r$-process material is drastically enhanced up to two orders of magnitude in relation  to a solar metallicity ISM. \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\keywords{hydrodynamics---nucleosynthesis, abundances---shock waves---stars: neutron---galaxies: ISM---ISM: supernova remnants}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe specific physical conditions and nuclear physics pathways  required for the $r$-process were originally identified in the pioneering work by \\citet{burbidge1957}. But the particular astrophysical site remains open to more than one interpretation \\citep{Sneden08}. Early  work on the subject identified  both type II supernovae \\citep{woosley1994, takahashi1994} and neutron-star binary mergers \\citep[NSBMs;][]{lattimer1977, freiburghaus1999} as likely candidate events to hold r-process. NSBMs are significantly  much rarer than type II supernovae \\citep[e.g.][]{{argast2004}} and take place far from their birth places, reaching distance up to a few~Mpc from their host halo \\citep[e.g.][]{kelley2010}. The two mechanisms  synthesize different quantities of $r$-process material, about $10^{-5}\\,\\rm{M_\\odot}$ and  $10^{-2}\\,\\rm{M_\\odot}$ for each type II supernovae and NSBM, respectively \\citep[e.g.][]{cowan2004}. \nThese differences should give rise to clear signatures  in the enrichment pattern of $r$-process elements in galaxies and  may ultimately help constrain the dominant production mechanism \\citep{shen2014}.\n\nWith many difficulties getting  the necessary conditions to produce the $r$-process in  type II supernova winds \\citep{qian1996, takahashi1994} ,\nthe NSBM  model has recently been extensively  studied and  shown to be a viable alternative.   The $r$-process nuclei have been found to be  robustly synthesized  \\citep{metzger2010, roberts2011, korobkin2012, bauswein2013, grossman2014, ramirez-ruiz2015,goriely2015, mendoza2015}\nand the  predicted galactic enrichment history of NSBMs  is consistent  with the abundance patterns observed in halo stars \\citep{shen2014,  tsujimoto2014, vandevoort2015, vangioni2016}.\nThis suggests that the injection of $r$-process material by  NSBMs   has been operating  in a fairly robust manner  over long periods of time in galactic  history, while the resultant  chemical abundance dispersions in $r$-process elements such as Eu  suggests an early, chemically unmixed and inhomogeneous early Milky \nWay galaxy. At later times, these localized inhomogeneities would fade out as  more events happen and $r$-process products are given more time to be transported  and mixed  throughout the galaxy. \n\nAn accurate treatment of the  evolution of the ejecta in NSBMs  is  thus crucial not only  for models of  electromagnetic transients \\citep{nakar2011, rosswog2014, kelley2013, metzner2012} following coalescence but also for  models of $r$-process enrichment in galaxies.  In contrast to the extensive efforts developing models for supernova  remnant evolution, \\citep{cox1974, mckee1977,blondin1998, joung2006,martizzi2015,kim2015} studies quantifying the impact of NSBM remnants   in a cosmological context  have not been carried out. The efficacy of transport and mixing of $r$-process in NSBM remnants has not been properly  quantified  mainly due to the highly inhomogeneous initial conditions  and  the  excessive radiative losses expected during the shock propagation.  \n\nIn this paper, we present the results of a series of controlled three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of NSBM remnants. \nTo calculate the ejected mass and initial structure of the tidal tails, we make use of three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations  \\citep[][]{roberts2011} of  NSBMs (Section~\\ref{mergers}).\n The resultant  homologous structure of the tidal tail is then mapped into an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulation with optically-thin radiative cooling (Section \\ref{hydro}).   Our goal is to understand  the evolution  of  single NSBM remnants,  which is quantified   in  Section~\\ref{dynamics},  and how it might  depend on  the properties of the surrounding medium,  which are derived using   a cosmological simulation of the formation of the Milky Way (Section~\\ref{amb}).  Our simulations of isolated NSBMs are used to construct  sub-resolution\nprescriptions for galaxy-scale simulations with inadequate resolution\nto properly define the the cooling radius of NSBM blast waves. Discussion of the results as well as detail comparisons with studies  from spherical models    are presented in Section~\\ref{dis}. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{Initial Conditions}\\label{mergers}\n\nTidal tails are a common feature formed during\nmergers and collisions between compact objects. These are typically a few thousand\nkilometers in size by the end of the merger event in the case of neutron star  disruptions by black holes  and NSBMs \\citep{lee2007, faber2012}.\nSome  small fraction of the material ($10^{-3} -10^{-2}M_\\odot$) in the tails\n is actually unbound and will escape to the surrounding medium. The  exact mass and  structure (density and velocity distribution) of the ejected material depends on the  mass ratio and  details of the equation of state \\citep[EoS; e.g.][]{roberts2011}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{fig1.pdf}\n \\caption{Cooling functions constructed using  the ion-by-ion cooling efficiencies for low-density gas derived by \\citet{gnat2012} and assuming that the full  radiative spectra  of $r$-process material  is similar to that of Fe.

The standard case of solar abundances is denoted here as $\\log (\\chi_{\\rm Fe} / \\chi_{\\rm Fe, \\odot})=0$. Once the cooling function is tabulated, the temperature variation within the expanding, cooling shocked  layer in the NSBM remnant can be calculated.}\t\n \\vspace{0.3cm}\n \\label{fig:coolingcurves}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo calculate the  density and velocity structure of the unbound tidal tails we use a similar method to the one described by \\citet{roberts2011}.  \nWe use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations \\citep{lee2007, lee2010} to follow the  merger of two neutron stars during which the geometry, densities, and timescales change violently \\citep{rasio1994, lee2000, rosswog2003}.  As a representative  example, we study the dynamics of the $M_{\\rm r}=0.05 M_\\odot$ material ejected during a NSBM with mass ratio $q = M_2 /M_1 =0.88$ \\citep{roberts2011}. A hybrid EoS, similar to that implemented  by \\citet{shibata2005}, is used which combines the cold Friedman-Pandharipande-Skyrme nuclear EoS with an ideal gas component. Once the initial dynamical interaction is realized, the fluid elements in the  unbound tails are verging on\nballistic trajectories, moving primarily under the influence of the central mass potential.   The hydrodynamical calculations are stopped only after the expansion of the unbound material becomes homologous. \nFigure 1 in \\citet{roberts2011} depicts the structure of the tidal tails at homology for a wide range of NSBMs. A clear progression is observed from equal mass tails formed in the $q = 1.0$ case to almost no secondary tail produced in the $q = 0.88$ case studied  here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Hydrodynamical  Evolution of NSBM Remnants}\\label{hydro}\n\nHere we follow the expansion of the tidal tail produced by  a NSBM with $q = 0.88$  in three dimensions with the parallel, adaptive-mesh, hydrodynamical code FLASH \\citep{fryxell2000}.  \nWe evolve the ideal  fluid  in three dimensional cartesian coordinates using a metallicity-dependent cooling function, which is  constructed using \nthe ion-by-ion cooling efficiencies for low-density gas derived by \\citet{gnat2012} for gas temperatures between $10^4$ and $10^8$ K. As it is generally adopted, we do not include metal fine structure transitions or molecular line cooling and so the cooling function is effectively truncated below $T\\approx  10^4$ K.\n\nFigure \\ref{fig:coolingcurves} shows\nthe cooling function for an optically thin thermal plasma with solar abundances assuming collisional equilibrium ({\\it blue} curve).\nThe full radiative spectra of $r$-process  material at the relevant densities and temperatures is not well known as complete atomic line lists for these heavy species are not available \\citep{kasen2013, tanaka2014, lippuner2015}. \nWe therefore simply assume that the energy integral of the full radiative spectra  of $r$-process material  is similar to that of Fe. The computed cooling  curves with enhanced Fe abundances are  plotted in Figure \\ref{fig:coolingcurves}.  This assumption is, however, of no consequence at all as  radiative losses begin to influence the NSBM remnant  evolution only when the metal content is almost exclusively  dominated by the swept up gas (see Section \\ref{dynamics} for specifics). As such,  the resulting evolution  is quantitatively \nsimilar to that computed using solar abundances, but note that we have implemented metal enhanced  cooling rates  here for completeness. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n  \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.38\\textwidth]{fig2.pdf}\n \\caption{The gas density, temperature and metallicity  at the NSBM injection\nsites in the Galaxy at redshifts $z=$ 2 and 3, as derived from the Eris simulation \\citep{shen2014, guedes2011}. \n The spatial distribution of \nNSBMs is assumed to broadly follow the stellar distribution of  the host\ngalaxy  while the injection rate is derived using the Eris star formation rate convolved  with a power-law delay-time distribution.

In Figure \\ref{fig:env} we show the expected properties of the  gas in and around  the  NSBM injection sites, derived using the  cosmological zoom-in simulation Eris,  which at redshift $z = 0$ is a close analog of the Milky Way \\citep{guedes2011}. The merger rate is inferred  by convolving the star formation history with a standard  delay-time distribution of mergers modeled by a power-law \\citep{piran1992, kalogera2001, shen2014}.  The resulting NSBM  history in the simulation is\nshown in Figure 1 of  \\citet{shen2014}.  The spatial distribution of NSBM\nmergers is  then assumed to  roughly follow the stellar distribution.  Using these two key model ingredients, the number and location of NSBMs\n can then be  estimated, which in turn can be used to infer the  density, temperature and metallicity  of the surrounding  ambient gas (Figure~\\ref{fig:env}). \nMotivated by this, we run three different types of simulations: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item isolated NSBM in a homogeneous ISM with $n_{\\rm H}=1\\;\\rm{cm^{-3}}$, $T=10^4$~K and $Z=Z_\\odot$;\n\\item  isolated NSBM in a homogeneous, dense   ISM with  $n_{\\rm H}=100 \\;\\rm{cm^{-3}}$,  $T=10^4$~K and $Z=Z_\\odot$;\n\\item isolated NSBM in a homogeneous, rarefied  ISM  with  $n_{\\rm H}=10^{-4}\\;\\rm{cm^{-3}}$, $T=10^6$~K and $Z=Z_\\odot$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe parameters of the different simulations are outlined in\nTable~\\ref{ta}. For comparison, standard blast wave simulations initiated by injecting the same  total energy in a spherical region are computed  in order to determine how the\nevolution of a NSBM is  initially altered by its non-uniform original structure. In all cases, we consider computational boxes filled\nwith an  ISM initially in pressure equilibrium and adopt\na refinement scheme based on pressure and density  gradients which refines\naround the expanding shock. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Hydrodynamical Evolution of NSBM Remnants}\\label{dynamics}\nThe evolution of an isolated NSBM remnant expanding  into  a uniform\nmedium can be broadly characterized by the well-known evolutionary stages of a supernova remnant (SNR):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the free expansion phase, during which the mass of the\ntidal ejecta is larger than the mass of the swept up ISM; \n\\item the energy conserving phase, during which radiative losses\nare not important; \n\\item the  cooling-modified pressure-driven snowplow phase, during which  shell formation occurs;\n\\item and  the  final momentum-conserving expansion phase.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n                   \\includegraphics[width=0.36\\textwidth]{fig3_lr.pdf}\n        \\caption{The evolution of a NSBM remnant expanding into a uniform ISM (fiducial run labelled {\\it ISM} in Table~\\ref{ta}). {\\it Top panel}: Density contours  (green) are plotted for 12 levels from $\\log(\\rho) = -23.4$ to $-20.8$ g cm${-3}$.

Levels of refinement are decreasing to reach a maximum level of eight with a maximum resolution of $1.203\\times10^{17}$~cm for the bottom snapshot.}\\label{fig:3d}\n\\end{figure}\nHowever, differences in ejected mass and  initial structure  modifies the evolution of a NSBM remnant relative to that  of a SNR, as \nillustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:3d} for our fiducial run (labelled {\\it ISM} in Table~\\ref{ta}).  The top panel shows the  evolution at time $t = 0.3$ kyr,  long after the free expansion phase and during the energy conserving phase. The kinetic energy of the NSBM $q=0.88$ tidal tail is $3.58 \\times 10^{51}$ erg. The ensuing strong blast wave converts much of this\nenergy into thermal energy, which leads to lateral expansion\\footnote{Similar to the case of remnants arising from  jet-driven supernova explosions \\citep{ramirez-ruiz2010,gonzalez2014} or from  the unbound debris of stars  disrupted by massive black holes \\citep{kasen2010,guillochon2015}.}.  As the NSBM remnant  ages, the thermal energy is lost\nto radiative cooling, the shock slows down, and shell formation is established. The bottom  panel in Figure~\\ref{fig:3d} shows the effect of the blast wave\npropagation at time $t = 0.07$ Myr, before  the onset of the remnant's  cooling-modified snowplow phase.\n\n\nThe top panel of Figure~\\ref{fig:ism} shows the evolution of the forward shock radius $R$ with\n time $t$  for the NSBM remnant  case shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:3d}. For comparison, the evolution \nof a spherical blast wave with the same initial mass and energy is also shown together with  the analytical Sedov-Taylor solution.  For spherical simulations, $R$ is identified by measuring\nspherically averaged  profiles, while for the NSBM simulations we approximate $R$ as the radius\nof the sphere enclosing 90\\% of the total energy (no significant difference in the measured radio was obtained from slightly different percentages). The radial  temperature $T$ and metal mass fraction $\\chi_{\\rm metal}$ profiles are then calculated  by measuring\nthe spherically averaged values of such quantities at $R$.  \n \n\n\nThe initial configuration of the ejected tidal tail material  is highly  inhomogeneous, as can be seen  in Figure~\\ref{fig:3d}, with shock expansion velocities being larger along the original orbital plane  of the NS binary. As a result, the rate of ambient  material  swept up by the blast wave is reduced relative to the spherical case until  lateral expansion  becomes important.  The Sedov-Taylor solution is an attractor and the NSBM remnant evolution slowly  adjust\nto match this spherical,  energy conserving solution. As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:ism}, the NSBM remnant becomes radiative  before matching   the Sedov-Taylor solution, which  increases  the local cooling time  and leads to\na decrease in  radiative losses when compared to the spherical case. Similar behavior is also seen in simulations \n of a NSBM remnant expanding into a dense ambient medium (Figure~\\ref{fig:dense}) and into a rarefied, hot  external environment (Figure~\\ref{fig:rarified}).\n\nIn a uniform medium, the shell formation epoch, which occurs when a SNR  becomes radiative,  is usually well characterized  by the time  the mass of swept up material  attains $M_{\\rm s}\\approx  10^3 M_\\odot$.
