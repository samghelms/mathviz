With only the\nacoustic-phonon-limited electron scattering, it is demonstrated that\na total growth rate of the plasmon instability,\nwith the terahertz/mid-infrared range of the frequency,\ncan exceed $4\\times10^{12}$ s$^{-1}$ at room temperature, \nwhich is an order of magnitude larger than in two-dimensional \nelectron gases based on usual semiconductors.\nBy comparing the simulation results with existing theory,\nit is revealed that the giant total growth rate originates from\nsimultaneous occurence of\nthe so-called Dyakonov-Shur and Ryzhii-Satou-Shur instabilities.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic, hydrodynamic, and electromagnetic properties of \ntwo-dimensional (2D) plasmons in channels of field-effect transistors\n(FETs) have been \ninvestigated extensively for their utilization to terahertz (THz) \n\ndevices~\\cite{Allen1977,Dyakonov1993,Dyakonov1996,Veksler2006,\nDyer2013,Rozhansky2015}\n(see also review \npapers~\\cite{Shur2003,Knap2009,Otsuji2014a,Otsuji2015a}\nand references therein).\nEspecially, plasmon instability is one of the most important \nproperties to realize compact, room-temperature operating THz \nsources. Self-excitation of plasmons due to instability induces \nac voltages in the gate electrodes and, in turn, leads to \nthe emission of THz waves.\n\nThe so-called Dyakonov-Shur (DS) \ninstability~\\cite{Dyakonov1993,Dmitriev1997,Dyakonov2005,Popov2008} \nand Ryzhii-Satou-Shur (RSS) \ninstability~\\cite{Ryzhii2005,Ryzhii2006e,Ryzhii2008c} \nin single-gate FETs were proposed theoretically\nas mechanisms of plasmon instability by dc current injection\nthrough the transistor channel.\nThe DS instability originates from the Doppler shift effect\nat asymmetric boundaries in the channel,\ni.e., zero time-variation of pontential at the source contact and \nzero time-variation of electron velocity near the drain contact,\nwhich are naturally realized by operating the FET in the\nsaturation regime.\nIn the same saturation regime, the RSS instability takes place due \nto the transit-time effect of fast-moving electrons in the \nhigh-field region in the drain side.\nAlternatively, the so-called dual-grating-gate structure\n(see Fig.~\\ref{FigSchematics}(a)),\nin which two types of interdigitately-placed gates form\na very efficient grating coupler between THz waves\nand 2D plasmons~\\cite{Otsuji2006a,Popov2011a}, \nhas been proposed for direct THz emission\nwithout antenna integration~\\cite{Otsuji2006a,Otsuji2008}.\nThe RSS instability in this structure\nhas been investigated analytically~\\cite{Ryzhii2008c}.\nIn addition, asymmetry of the gate placement expects to lead to \npartial realization of the asymmetric boundary conditions \nand, in turn, of the DS \ninstability~\\cite{Otsuji2014a,Otsuji2015a}.\n\nHowever, in FETs or high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs)\nbased on usual semiconductors (Si and compound semiconductors \nsuch as InGaAs and GaN), growth rates of\nthe instabilities are of the order of $10^{11}$ s$^{-1}$, \n\n\n\n\nwhich are limited by electron saturation velocities\n($\\lesssim 2\\times10^{7}$ cm/s in the GaAs channel).\nWith such low growth rates the plasmons are easily damped out \nat room temperature by a large damping rate \n($\\gtrsim 10^{12}$ s$^{-1}$) associated with electron scattering.\n\nPlasmons in graphene have then attracted much attention\nowning to its gapless energy\nspectrum and massless carriers\n~\\cite{Ryzhii2006c,Ryzhii2007a,Mikhailov2011,Dubinov2011,\nJu2011,Vicarelli2012,Wang2012a,Svintsov2012,Grigorenko2012,\nPopov2013a}.\nThe most straightfoward yet striking advantage of graphene\nplasmons over those in usual semiconductors is\nits ultimately low scattering rate at room temperature,\nif external scattering sources in graphene such as impurities and \ndefects and those induced by the substrate and gate insulator are \nexcluded and the electron scattering is limited only \nby the acoustic-phonon scattering~\\cite{Hwang2008b} in graphene. \nThen, the plasmon damping rate can be down to $10^{11}$ \ns$^{-1}$~\\cite{Satou2013}, together with the electron drift velocity \nup to $\\lesssim 10^{8}$ cm/s. These lead to an\nexpectation that the plasmon instabilities in graphene \nare very strong and can take place at room temperature.\nAlthough the technology of graphene fabrication with\nulitimately high quality still needs to be progressed, \na recent experimental report on \ngraphene encapsulated into hexagonal boron nitride \nlayers~\\cite{Wang2013a}, which demonstrated the \nelectron mobility at room temperature comparable to the \nacoustic-phonon-limited value, supports its feasibility.\n\n\nIn this Letter, we conduct simulations of the plasmon instabilities\nin the dual-grating-gate graphene FET with \ndc current injection, assuming the accoustic-phonon-limited\nscattering rate at room temperature,\nand demonstrate occurence of giant instabilities with their total \ngrowth rate (which we define as the growth rate subtracting\nthe damping rate) exceeding $4\\times10^{12}$ s$^{-1}$ and with\nthe plasmon frequency ranging in the THz/mid-infrared range.\nWe show the gate-length dependence of the plasmon frequency and \nthe total growth rate extracted from the simulations, and we\nfound distinct dependences of growth rates specific to\nthe DS and RSS instabilities~\\cite{Dyakonov1993,Ryzhii2005},\nthus identifying the giant total growth rate as simultaneous\noccurence, or more specifically, a linear superposition of \nthose instabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{schematics.eps}\n  \\caption{\\label{FigSchematics}\n    Schematic views of (a) a dual-grating-gate graphene FET\n    and (b) a profile of steady-state electron concentration\n    under consideration.}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nMechanisms of the DS and RSS instabilities and their features \nare summarized as follows.\nThe DS instability originates from the Doppler shift effect\nat asymmetric boundaries. In case of FETs in the saturation regime,\nthe potential is fixed at the source side (the short boundary),\nwhile the current, i.e., the electron velocity is fixed\nat the drain side (the open boundary). \nBetween these asymmetric boundaries, a resonant cavity for plasmons\nis formed. Then, the open boundary reflects traveling \nplasmons towards it with the current amplitude preserved,\nwhereas the short boundary reflects them with amplification.\nThe resonant frequency of the excited plasmons is determined by \ngeometrical factors (gate length, gate dielectric thickness, and \nlengths of ungated regions in the channel) and gate voltage \nthrough the electron concentration. The latter enables the tuning\nof the frequency. On the other hand,\nthe RSS instability takes place in the same saturation regime due \nto the transit-time effect of fast-moving electrons in the \nhigh-field region (i.e., the low-concentration region) in the \ndrain side. The electric field created by those electrons \nmodulates the concentration at the edge of the high-concentration\nregion and results in the bunching of electrons in the\nlow-concentration region. Depending on the length of the \nlow-concentration region and the electron velocity, \nit interferes with plasmons in the high-concentration region\neither constructively or destructively. The constructive\ninterference corresponds to the instability. The plasmon \nfrequency is again determined by the geometrical factors\nin the high-concentration region and the gate voltage.\n\nIn case of dual-grating-gate structures, both instabilities can be\nrealized by following configurations.\nFirst, the resonant plasmon cavity can be formed by modulating\nthe concentration profile through gate voltages in such a way that\nhigh- and low-concentration regions are created.\nThis also enables the occurence of the RSS instability.\nSecond, asymmetry of the gate placement leads to \npartial realization of the asymmetric boundary conditions\nand, in turn, of the DS instability. \n\nFigure~\\ref{FigSchematics}(a) shows a dual-grating-gate graphene \nFET under consideration. In our simulation model, we assume \nthat the number of periods of the grating gates is sufficiently \nlarge, i.e., the total channel length is longer than the \nTHz/mid-infrared wavelength, so that we can ignore effects of \nnonperiodicity such as the presence of the source and drain contacts \nand we can consider one period as a unit cell.\nWe fix the thickness of the gate dielectric, $W_{\\text{g}} = 50$ nm,\nthe left spacings of the gates 1 and 2,\n$s_{\\text{g}1} = 200$ nm, $s_{\\text{g}2} = 300$ nm, \nwhereas we vary the lengths of the gate 1 and 2, $L_{\\text{g}1}$\nand $L_{\\text{g}2}$, in the range between $100$ and $400$ nm\nin order to reveal characteristics of the instabilities\nobtained in this work by comparison with existing theory.\nThe values of those parameters were chosen such a way that \nfrequencies of self-excited plasmons fall into the THz/mid-infrared\nrange.\nThe dielectric constant of media surrounding the graphene channel \nis set to $\\epsilon = 4$.\nFigure~\\ref{FigSchematics}(b) is a profile of the steady-state \nelectron concentration without current flow, and it was calculated \nself-consistently \nwith a uniform electron doping $\\Sigma_{e} = 5\\times10^{11}$ \ncm$^{-2}$ together with certain gate voltages.\nThe slight electron doping is introduced to avoid plasmon damping\ndue to the electron-hole friction~\\cite{Svintsov2012};\neven at the point with the lowest electron concentration, the hole\nconcentration is negligibly low, $\\Sigma_{h} = 6.8\\times10^{9}$\ncm$^{-2}$. On the other hand, the highest electron concentration\nis set not so high that the difference between maximum and\nminimum Fermi energies ($166$ and $68.5$ meV, respectively) \ndoes not exceed optical-phonon energies in graphene and thus\nelectrons injected quasi-ballistically from the region with high\nelectron concentration do not experience\noptical-phonon emission, which would critically hinder \nthe RSS instability.\n\nWe use the quasi-classical Boltzmann equation to describe \nthe electron transport in the channel:\n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{EqBoltzmann}\n  \\frac{{\\partial} f}{{\\partial} t}+{v_{\\text{F}}}\\frac{p_{x}}{|\\bm{p}|}\\frac{{\\partial} f}{{\\partial} x}\n  -eE_{x}\\frac{{\\partial} f}{{\\partial} p_{x}} = J_{\\text{LA}}(f|\\bm{p}),\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{{\\partial}f}{{\\partial}t}+{v_{\\text{F}}}\\frac{p_{x}}{|\\bm{p}|}\\frac{{%&#10;\\partial}f}{{\\partial}x}-eE_{x}\\frac{{\\partial}f}{{\\partial}p_{x}}=J_{\\text{LA%&#10;}}(f|\\bm{p}),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mtext>F</mtext></msub><mfrac><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>x</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\ud835\udc91</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo></mrow></mfrac><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>-</mo><mi>e</mi><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>x</mi></msub><mfrac><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>\u2202</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><msub><mi>p</mi><mi>x</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>J</mi><mtext>LA</mtext></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">|</mo><mi>\ud835\udc91</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.08108.tex", "nexttext": "\n\nand an explicit expression of the transition probability\n$W_{\\text{LA}}$ can be found in Ref.~\\cite{Hwang2008b}.\n\n\nWe use the so-called weighted essentially nonoscillatory\nfinite-difference scheme~\\cite{Carrillo2003b, Galler2006} to\nsolve Eq.~(\\ref{EqBoltzmann}),\nwhich is demonstrated to be applicable for graphene transport \nsimulation~\\cite{Lichtenberger2011}.

First, the estimated\ndamping rate was around $1.2\\times10^{11}$ s$^{-1}$ in the \nlow-concentration region and $2.5\\times10^{11}$ s$^{-1}$\nin the high-concentration region; note that the electron \nscattering rate, and thus the plasmon damping rate, for\nthe acoustic-phonon scattering is proportional\nto the square root of the electron \nconcentration~\\cite{Hwang2008b,Satou2013}.\nSuch low values of the plasmon damping rate \ncan be achieved only at nitrogen temperature or lower\nin other materials.\n\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that \nthe low-concentration region with adjacent ungated regions \nacts as a better (passive) plasmon resonant cavity,\nwhile the instabilities take place primarily\nfor plasmons in the high-concentration region, as is evident\nfrom the dependence of the frequency on $L_{\\text{g}1}$ \nand its consistency with Eq.~(\\ref{EqFreq}),\nand the frequency is insensitve to the length of the gate 2\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{FigFreqGrowthRateLg2Dep}\n(in contrast, the total growth rate can vary with it).\nThis is similar to the situation \ndiscussed in Ref.~\\cite{Popov2008a},\nwhere the ungated plasmon resonance can be effectively tuned\nby the gated region of the channel.\nIn fact, it can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{FigPosDepVelocity} \nthat a higher harmonic oscillation with more than one nodes is \nexcited in the low-concentration region. This together with the \noscillation in the high-concentration region form the fundamental \nmode of the whole period.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\begin{center}\n    \\includegraphics[width=6.2cm]{freqGrowthRate-Lg2Dep.eps}\n  \\caption{\\label{FigFreqGrowthRateLg2Dep}\n    (a) Total growth rate and frequency of the fundamental \n    mode as functions of the length of the gate 2.}\n  \\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn addition,\nvalues of drift velocities obtained in the simulation,\n$\\simeq 4\\times10^{7}$ cm/s in the low-concentration region\nand $\\simeq 10^{7}$ cm/s in the high-concentration region,\nconfirm the factor (2) for the giant growth rate.\nEspecially the former is more than twice larger than the\nsaturation velocity in Si and InGaAs channels. However, \nthe velocities extracted by Eq.~(\\ref{EqGrowthRate}) as \nfitting parameters differ from these values by several factors.\nA reasonable explanation to this discrepancy is that \nthe DS instability also takes place not only in the \nhigh-concentration region but also in the low-concentration\nregion.\nFig.~\\ref{FigPosDepVelocity} exhibits waves propagating in \nopposite directions in the latter, suggesting the occurence\nof the DS instability there. This should add a constant term\nin Eq.~(\\ref{EqGrowthRate}), and then the fitting velocities\nshould become closer to the simulated values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we have conducted simulations of plasmon instability\ndriven by dc current injection in the \ndual-grating-gate graphene FET. We have obtained a giant \ntotal growth rate of the instability at room temperature \nexceeding $4\\times10^{12}$ s$^{-1}$.\nThrough the dependences of the total growth rate and frequency \non the gate lengths, we have revealed that the giant total \ngrowth rate originates from simulateneous occurence of the DS \nand RSS instabilities.\nThe result obtained strongly suggests that a graphene FET\nwith the dual-grating-gate structure is very promising for\nthe realization of a high-power, compact, room-temperature \noperating THz source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work was financially supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for \nYoung Researcher (\\#26820122), by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Specially \nPromoted Research (\\#23000008),\nand by JSPS and RFBR under Japan-Russia Research Cooperative \nProgram.
