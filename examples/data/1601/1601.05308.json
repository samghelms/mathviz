Black cupric oxide (CuO) surfaces are chemically grown in minutes on any copper surface, allowing for low-cost, rapid prototyping and production.  The reflective properties are measured to be comparable to commercially available products for creating optically black surfaces.  We describe a vacuum apparatus which uses multiple blackened copper surfaces for sensitive, low-background detection of molecules using laser-induced fluorescence. \\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n \n \\section{Introdution}\nLaser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection is a simple yet powerful technique frequently used in gas-phase atomic and molecular spectroscopy \\cite{Kinsey1977,Scoles1988,Pauly2000,Demtroder2015}.  In many interesting situations, LIF signals are fairly small. For example, in the gas phase, rovibrational branching from molecular electronic states may lead to LIF signals of $\\lesssim$\\,1 photon per molecule.  Modern experiments with atoms \\cite{Gross2015}, molecules \\cite{Moerner2003}, and ions \\cite{Leibfried2003} frequently aim to detect small numbers of particles---sometimes as few as one.  In such cases, scattered laser light (and the noise from it) can seriously degrade the signal-to-background and signal-to-noise ratios in LIF detection.\n\n\n   Blackened surfaces are often used to suppress scattered light in LIF detection experiments \\cite{Scoles1988, Hall1984, Pauly2000}.  Recently, we have investigated optically black materials for stray light suppression to facilitate efficient detection of molecules via LIF  (for use in experiments on laser slowing \\cite{Barry2012}, cooling \\cite{Shuman2010}, and trapping \\cite{Barry2014, McCarron2015,Norrgard2015} of SrF molecules).  Here, we present a method for producing ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatible low-reflectivity surfaces that is simple to implement and very flexible in its utility.  Our method, which we refer to as ``copper blackening'', uses a simple chemical treatment to produce black, dendritic cupric oxide (CuO) on the surfaces of any pre-formed copper part.  We describe the method and present measurements of the reflectance properties of these prepared surfaces.  Measurements on blackened copper surfaces are compared to measurements on well-characterized commercial surfaces.\n\n   Blackened copper has a number of attractive properties for stray light suppression solutions.  Copper is easily machined or formed, and the surfaces may be grown in minutes on parts of any manufactured geometry.  Vacuum components may be made of blackened copper, and undesired reflective surfaces may be covered with blackened copper foils or sheets formed into any desired shape.   Blackened copper is suitable in UHV from cryogenic temperatures up to 500\\,$^{\\circ}$C \\cite{Kirsch2001}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Blackening Method}\n\n Copper has two common oxidization states: the red $\\rm{Cu_2O}$ (cuprous oxide) and the black CuO (cupric oxide).  The black CuO is effectively grown on the surface of metallic copper by immersing the metal in a solution composed of 100 g of NaOH and 100 g of NaCl$\\rm{O_2}$ per liter of deionized water \\cite{Meyer1944}.

Values for $\\rho(\\theta_{\\rm{i}}$\\,=\\,0$^\\circ)$ are tabulated in Table \\ref{tab:material}.  To confirm that the calculated $F_{\\rm{r}}$ and $\\rho$ values were reliable, $\\rho$ was measured for a near-Lambertian, high-reflectivity surface (Bright White 98).  We measured \\mbox{$\\rho(\\theta_{\\rm{i}}$\\,=\\,0$^{\\circ})$\\,=\\,0.95} at 532\\,nm, compared to the manufacturer-specified value 0.96 typical at 550\\,nm (no test data at 1064\\,nm were available from the manufacturer).  For a commercial light-absorbing blackened surface provided on aluminum foil (Acktar Metal Velvet, AMV), we measure \\mbox{$\\rho (\\theta_{\\rm{i}}$\\,=\\,0$^\\circ$)\\,=\\,0.005} at 532\\,nm, also in fair agreement with the manufacturer's specified typical value of 0.006.\n\nIn all cases investigated at normal incidence, the AMV provided the blackest surface.   However, the blackened copper had only marginally higher reflectance than the AMV, and proved generally comparable to standard black felt cloth.   At normal incidence, no significant difference was measured between blackened copper starting with a stock finish and copper with its surface roughened by sandblasted prior to cleaning and blackening.  At $\\lambda$\\,=\\,532\\,nm, blackened copper is $\\approx$\\,50\\% more reflective than black felt, and  $\\approx$\\,75\\% more reflective than AMV.  At 1064\\,nm, blackened copper is $\\approx$\\,2$\\times$ less reflective than black felt, and $\\approx$\\,3$\\times$ more reflective than AMV.\n\n  In Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:angle}, we plot the measured BAIRDF as a function of reflected angle $\\theta_{\\rm{r}}$ for incident angle $\\theta_{\\rm{i}}$\\,=\\,0$^{\\circ}$ (left) and $\\theta_{\\rm{i}}$\\,=\\,70$^{\\circ}$ (right) for four common laser wavelengths $\\lambda$: 405, 532, 650, and 1064 nm.  The DHR for normal incidence is given in Table \\ref{tab:angle}.  As a consistency check of our BAIRDF data, we note that by reciprocity we expect $F_{\\rm{r}}(\\theta_{\\rm{i}}, \\theta_{\\rm{r}})\\,=\\,F_{\\rm{r}}(\\theta_{\\rm{r}}, \\theta_{\\rm{i}})$.  For all cases in Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:angle}, these values agree to within 20\\,\\%.\n\n\n  At normal incidence, the blackened stock and sandblasted copper display reflectance nearly independent of $\\theta_{\\rm{r}}$.  Both surface preparation methods produce comparable values of $\\rho(\\theta_{\\rm{i}}\\,=\\,0^{\\circ})$ for all wavelengths tested.\n\n\nBlackened copper produced from stock material was found to specularly reflect for $\\theta_{\\rm{i}}\\gtrsim 75^{\\circ}$, making it highly ineffective at reducing scattered light at near-grazing incidence.  Sandblasting (using sand with typical particle diameter $\\sim$\\,10\\,$\\mu$m) produces a diffuse surface over a much larger scale than the typical scale of the dendrites ($\\sim$\\,100\\,nm \\cite{Xia2014,Filipic2012}).  We expected that sandblasting would tend to randomize the surface normal, and indeed no specular reflection component was observed for blackened sandblasted copper for any angle of incidence we were able to test, $\\theta_{\\rm{i}} < 89^\\circ$.  However, the removed specular reflection is accompanied by increased forward (positive $\\theta_{\\rm{r}}$) diffuse scatter.  For $\\theta_{\\rm{i}}\\,=\\,70^{\\circ}$ (an incident angle just below the onset of significant specular reflection in blackened stock copper), the stock finish has less forward scatter than the sandblasted copper, while back scatter is lower for the sandblasted copper.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width= \\linewidth]{examplespng.eps}\n        \\caption{(Color online) Examples of blackened copper parts.

Excitation by the $\\approx$\\,660\\,mW of $\\lambda$\\,=\\,663\\,nm light in the center of the chamber induces fluorescence from the trapped molecules at the same wavelength.  Light is collected by a 2''-diameter, 150-mm-focal-length spherical singlet lens placed directly outside the vacuum chamber, followed by a 50-mm-focal-length, f/0.95 camera lens.   The magnification factor at the imaging position is $M$\\,=\\,0.45.  Directly opposite the camera is a blackened Cu screen against which the molecules are imaged.  The total light detection efficiency for our system (including geometry, optical losses, and camera quantum efficiency) is 0.4\\% \\cite{Barry2014}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scattering from the viewports is minimized by using high optical quality (10-5 scratch dig) glass with an anti-reflection V-coating at 663\\,nm. Standard vacuum nipples with blackened copper sheet inserts (Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:examples}b) reduce stray light in two ways.  First, they reduce the power of light scattered directly from viewport surface imperfections into the LIF detection region, simply by placing the viewports further from the imaging chamber ($\\approx$\\,10'') than they would be in the absence of the nipple ($\\approx$\\,5'').  Second, the blackened inserts increase the likelihood that light incident on the walls of the nipple (either directly or through scattering) is absorbed before reaching the imaging region. Background light is additionally reduced by baffles \\cite{Scoles1988} formed by blackened Cu rings with a knife-edged inner diameter machined to be 26\\,mm, which sit inside the imaging chamber flush with the vacuum-sealing Cu gasket.\n\n\nFig.\\,\\ref{fig:examples}c shows a blackened copper disk for stray light absorption (not shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:motchamber}) which covered the entire bottom of the molecule imaging chamber in \\cite{Barry2014, McCarron2015}. A hole in the center provides optical access for the two vertical passes of the 663\\,nm light.  For the work in Ref.\\,\\cite{Norrgard2015}, this disk was replaced with the assembly shown in Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:examples}d, where blackened copper rods serve as heat conduits (thick outer rods) for in-vacuum high-power circuit boards.  We found that the unmodified blackened surface does not allow for good thermal contact.  However, deliberately crushing the CuO dendrites on the thermally connected surface and applying a 0.004\"-thick indium thermal interface layer (TIL) gave nearly the same thermal conductivity as obtained with a typical method for making heat links with unblackened copper (sanding the copper surface with 2000 grit sandpaper and applying an indium TIL).  Using an indium TIL without crushing the dendrites gave reduced conductivity (roughly 2$\\times$ less), similar to that of sanded copper without indium present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring normal trap operation, we measure the maximum photon scattering rate per molecule to be $R_{\\rm{sc}}$\\,=\\,2.5$\\times$\\,10$^6$\\,s$^{-1}$.   Analysis is restricted to a region of interest of typically $50 \\times 50$ pixels ($3.2 \\times 3.2$\\,mm) where the majority of the LIF signal is imaged.  The background scattered light signal is typically $B = 1.5\\times 10^4$ e$^-$/pixel/s.  For a typical $t_{\\rm{e}}$\\,=\\,60\\,ms exposure, the noise is usually limited by shot noise in this background, at the level $N_{\\rm{B}} \\approx$\\,30\\,e$^-$/pixel.  Under these conditions, the laser intensity noise, camera read noise, and camera dark current are approximately 4, 8 and 10$^4$ times smaller than $N_{\\rm{B}}$, respectively. Integrating over the region of interest gives a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0.39 per molecule for a single trap loading shot.  With this system, we have observed MOTs of as few as 17 molecules \\cite{Norrgard2015}, with SNR\\,$\\approx$\\,110 when averaging over 300 successive shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion and Outlook}\nWe have used a procedure to produce blackened copper surfaces \\cite{Meyer1944}, suitable for use in UHV applications.  We measure these surfaces to be only a few times more reflective than commercial UHV light-absorbing foil.  While such foils are available with low-outgassing adhesives, they typically have strict temperature requirements (40\\,$^{\\circ}$C\\,$\\lesssim$\\,$T$\\,$\\lesssim$\\,150\\,$^{\\circ}$C).  Blackened copper requires no adhesive, can be baked at high temperature in vacuum, and can be applied chemically to complex surfaces as well as to flexible foils and sheets.  Sandblasting prior to blackening is found to decrease diffuse back scatter, increase diffuse forward scatter, and remove specular reflection.\n\nThe advantages of vacuum-compatibility, rapid prototyping, and low cost make this technique ideally suited for scattered light suppression in experiments with LIF signals from a gas-phase source.  Recently, blackened copper surfaces installed in our vacuum chamber reduced stray light noise to a level sufficient to detect a small handful of molecules via LIF \\cite{Norrgard2015}.  We also plan to use this technique to reduce scattered light background in various types of precision measurements using LIF from molecular beams \\cite{Baron2014,Cahn2014,Hunter2012}, and we expect this technology will be useful in similar experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nThe authors thank E.R.
