These are sufficiently bright and compact to permit direct imaging using existing very long baseline interferometers such as the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA).  We show that these events are relatively common, occurring at a rate of $\\approx40~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$ of which $1.3~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$ are associated with Galactic black holes.  Features in the associated images, e.g., the Einstein ring, are sufficiently well resolved to fully reconstruct the lens properties, enabling the measurement of mass, distance, and tangential velocity of the lensing object to a precision better than 15\\%. Future radio microlensing surveys conducted with upcoming radio telescopes combined with modest improvements in the VLBA could increase the rate of Galactic black hole events to roughly 10~${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, sufficient to double the number of known stellar mass black holes in a couple years, and permitting the construction of distribution functions of stellar mass black hole properties.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{gravitational lensing: micro --- masers --- radio lines: stars --- stars: black holes}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction} \n\nGravitational lensing presents one of a handful of current\nobservational windows on the dark universe.  The distortion of\nbackground galaxies by galaxy clusters has provided a striking\ndemonstration of general relativity \\citep{2010CQGra..27w3001B}. More importantly, it has\nenabled the unique reconstruction of the projected mass density of the\ncluster dark matter haloes \\citep{refregier,pac}.  While the dynamics of stars and gas\nprobe the dark matter halo within $10^2~{\\rm kpc}$ of the central\ngalaxy \\citep{sal}, gravitational lensing currently provides the only\nmeans to detect and study the halo on larger scales.  By combining\nsuch measurements, it has become possible to map the dark matter\ndistribution in the local universe \\citep{shan}.\n\nThe detailed structure of a gravitationally lensed image may be\nseparated into the intrinsic structure of the lensed object and a\ndistortion imposed by the lens that depends upon the lens location and\nmass distribution.  A typical scale is set by the Einstein angle,\nthis is exactly the angular scale of the Einstein ring cast by a point lens,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation} \n\\theta_E \n=\n\\sqrt{\\frac{4GM (D_S-D_L)}{c^2 D_S D_L} }\\,,\n\\label{thetae}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\theta_{E}=\\sqrt{\\frac{4GM(D_{S}-D_{L})}{c^{2}D_{S}D_{L}}}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b8</mi><mi>E</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msqrt><mfrac><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>G</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>S</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>L</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>S</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>L</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></msqrt></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05801.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\bm{\\mu}_S$ and $\\bm{\\mu}_L$ are the source and lens apparent\nangular velocities, respectively.

The relationship between $t_E$ and the lens structure implies a\ncharacteristic light curve, referred to as a microlensing event.\n\nThe rarity of serendipitous lens-source alignments require the monitoring of large numbers of potential sources to identify candidate microlensing events.  For this purpose optical surveys of dense star fields have been undertaken by a number of groups, both to constrain the contribution of stellar remnants to the Galactic dark matter budget \\citep{moniez2010} and more recently to find extrasolar planets which results in short time-scale features in the microlensing light curve \\citep{gaudi2012}.  These have successfully excluded remnants with masses between $10^{-7}M_\\odot$--$10M_\\odot$ as a candidate for dark matter within the Galactic halo \\citep{lasserre,alcock2001}.\n\n\nMotivated by the potential to detect extra-solar planets, recent years\nhave seen the initiation of high-cadence, large-area surveys.

As a direct consequence, the mass of the lens, and the\ndistances and velocities of the lens and source suffer from\na fundamental degeneracy.  Methods for breaking the mass-distance\ndegeneracy typically requires higher-order effects.  If the\nmicrolensing parallax can be measured -- an \nasymmetry in the light curve induced by the non-uniform motion of\nthe Earth -- the lens distance and the mass of the lens can be constrained \n\\citep{gould92,rah03}. \nParallax effect can also be employed by monitoring microlensing events from earth and space\nsimultaneously. Spitzer has been used to this end, measuring microlensing parallax and thus \nproviding an additional constrain \\citep{2015arXiv150807027S}.\nAlternatively the source finite-size effect could be used to break the degeneracy. If\nthe angular impact parameter is smaller than the source angular size the point source\napproximation is no longer valid and the finite-size effect becomes important.\nBy analyzing the light curve an additional relation between angular source size and angular Einstein \nradius could be found.\nIn both cases, the lens and the source apparent\nmotions must be subsequently measured after the event to remove these\nfrom consideration \\citep[see, e.g.,][]{2014JKAS...47..215G}, which is only possible for\nstellar lenses and explicitly excludes those associated with stellar\nremnants.\n\nDirectly resolving the image would greatly simplify the\nreconstruction of the lens parameters.

Since in the simulation we flag lenses that are either main sequence or remnants and, we can classify lenses based on lens type.  Here we compare the overall microlensing events with those produced by black holes specifically; the fraction of events with black hole lenses is $0.035$.\nThis fraction is comparable to the estimate of \\citet{gould2000}, which finds 0.01 assuming a 100\\% detection efficiency, and thus neglecting the higher detection efficiency of Mira events.\n\nAnother important point is the average $t_E$ for the overall events and black hole events are 38~days and 127~days, respectively.  This is unsurprising since the duration of events scales with lens mass as $M^{1/2}$, and is an immediate consequence of the fact that the average black hole mass is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that of the overall sample.  Hence, black hole lensing events are typically more than three times longer than the typical microlensing event, with important consequences for identification and parameter estimation.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure4.eps}\n\\caption{Distribution of lens positions in galaxy for various lens populations.

Events are dominated by lenses within the disk (65\\%) with the remainder from the bulge (35\\%); the spheroid contributes negligibly.  Of note is that the lens distribution within the disk is nearly evenly distributed between the bulge and a heliocentric distance of 2~kpc, implying that microlensing surveys necessarily probe the lens population throughout the intervening disk.  This remains true independent of the lens type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Radio-Bright Microlensing Event Rates} \\label{sec:rates}\n\nKey to the radio imaging of microlensing events is the identification of radio-bright lensed sources.  In the near term this requires the identification of candidate events based on their optical properties alone.  Here we discuss the rates implied by the previous section employing surveys that exploit optical counterparts of radio bright sources (i.e., Mira variables) and the potential rates from future radio microlensing surveys.  This is ultimately dependent on the population and distribution of candidate sources.\n\n\\subsection{Miras as Microlensing Sources}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure5.eps}\n\\caption{Color-Magnitude diagram for OGLE III Microlensing events.  Half of the stars in the red box are likely to be Mira variables. The small blue line inside the red box shows how much a MIII giant will move in HR diagram as a result of blending with a solar type (G2V) lens star located half way between the source and observer.}\n\\label{goodCMD}\n\\end{figure}\n\nMiras provide a natural class of optically bright sources with strong radio emission in the form of circumstellar SiO masers.  In most microlensing surveys Miras have already been identified due to their variable nature.  Where they have not, they are readily identified in the optical color magnitude diagram. (Figure \\ref{goodCMD}).  Importantly, there is little chance for source confusion -- blending of source and lens stars does not move objects appreciably within the region populated by Miras.\n\nThe variable nature of Miras provide an immediate impediment to their use as microlensing survey targets; typical Miras vary with periods of $\\approx 1~\\mathrm{yr}$, I-band variability amplitudes between $1.4~{\\rm mag}$ and $3~{\\rm mag}$ \\citep{Soszynski13}, and V-band variability amplitudes typically two--three times larger \\citep{1990gcvs.book.....K}.  However, black hole microlensing events can be easily distinguished from the intrinsic variability as a result of three important differences.  All of these may be exploited in part due to the high luminosity of Miras, and therefore the high photometric accuracy with which they may be monitored.\n\nFirstly, microlensing light curves have a well-understood and uniform structure set by the lens-source geometry and nature of gravitational lensing, characterized by a divergent rise as the source approaches the lens caustics (moderated by the finite source size).  This differs starkly from the smooth intrinsic variations of Miras.  Thus careful light curve fitting should be able to rapidly distinguish between microlensing and intrinsic variability.\n\nSecond, the amplitude of the flux variation during microlensing events is typically larger than that due to intrinsic variability.  Typical magnifications are of order 450\\%, while high-magnification events can exceed an 1000\\%.  These correspond to magnitude variations of $1.5~{\\rm mag}$ and $2.5~{\\rm mag}$, comparable the that caused by intrinsic variations in I-band.  Hence, the microlensing signal is an order unity modification of the underlying source variability in I-band.  At longer wavelengths the intrinsic variability decreases further, on average variations in the magnitude at 1.25~$\\mu$m are 20\\% of those at optical wavelengths \\citep{2002AJ....123..948S}\\footnote{ There are instances for which near-infrared variability is nevertheless sizable, e.g., R Cas, where the amplitude of variations at 1.25~$\\mu$m are as large as 1.42~mag.  However, the variability continues to drop rapidly with increasing wavelength.}.\n\nThirdly, the flux variations due to microlensing are achromatic.  Again this is in stark contrast to the intrinsic variability of Miras, which varies dramatically with wavelength. Thus, multi-band monitoring should be readily able to disentangle the two variability components.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Bulge Miras Microlensing Rates}\n\nThe OGLE III survey monitored approximately $150$ million stars in Galactic bulge from 2001 to 2009 in search for gravitational microlensing events and provided us with the largest catalogue of microlensing events available.  OGLE used the Early Warning System (EWS) to detect ongoing microlensing events \\citep{earlyw}. EWS uses Difference Image Analysis photometry and by analyzing all the stars in the field flags the potential microlensing events \\citep{alard}.  In doing so it currently identifies and filters out variable stars. The flagged stars go through several tests including a visual inspection of the light curve and after satisfying all the criteria they are announced as a microlensing candidate.\n\nWe used OGLE III microlensing alerts data (2002 - 2009) to find the relative number of Mira-type candidates, demonstrating their high detection efficiency (though note that all Miras will have been excluded). Of all the $4052$ events $2015$ had both V and I magnitudes available which were used for our analysis.  The events which only have I band measurements would not have a substantial contribution to M III stars, since they are mainly faint stars.  Figure \\ref{goodCMD} shows the CMD for these events together with the box to select type M III stars. \nThese are a few orders of magnitude brighter than M-dwarfs, increasing their representation in microlensing surveys.  An advantage of using bright stars is that blending by background and lens stars do not affect the brightness of the source star significantly (Figure \\ref{goodCMD}). Moreover, from the lens equation, and estimating the mass of the lens star, we can calculate the contribution of blending and correct the position of source star in CMD \\citep{muraki,miyake}.\n\nWithin the OGLEIII catalogue there are currently $6528$ Miras \\citep{Soszynski13}.  The larger number of Miras inferred in the bulge suggest that this can be readily enlarged by surveying the entire bulge region.  Estimates based on the OGLEII catalogue suggest as many as $\\approx 6 \\times 10^5 $ Miras in Galactic Bulge \\citep{Matsunaga05}.  The large luminosities of Miras implies a near unity detection efficiency, and thus as discussed around equation (\\ref{eq:Nevents}), we anticipate a total bulge-Mira microlensing event rate of $11~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$.  Therefore, monitoring the Galactic Bulge alone will produce $\\approx 0.4$  black hole microlensing events per year associated with a radio-bright source, enabling radio imaging.\n \n\n\\subsection{Current and Near-future Optical Survey Microlensing Rates}\nAt least two future microlensing surveys are underway, exceeding OGLE III in three ways: higher cadence, deeper magnitude limits, and increased sky coverage.  OGLE IV, in operation since 2010, has a bulge field of $\\approx 330~ \\mathrm{deg}^2$, 3.3 times larger than that of OGLE III.  The resulting OGLE IV EWS event rate is three times larger than that of OGLE III; OGLE III EWS detected about $650$ events in 2008 whereas OGLE IV EWS detected almost $2000$ events in 2013 and over $2000$ in 2014.  The forthcoming The Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) consists of three dedicated $1.6~\\mathrm{m}$ telescopes located in Australia, South Africa, and South America, each with $4~ \\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of view.  Thus, KMTNet anticipates detecting $\\approx 2300$ microlensing events per year with constant cadence of almost 10~min \\citep{kmt2014}.\n\nThe high luminosity of Miras and the long time-scales of black hole microlensing events imply that the first two, higher cadence and deeper magnitude limits, will at best produce modest improvements in the Mira microlensing rate.  High cadences will vastly over-sample black hole microlensing light curves, and thus while important for planet searches are unlikely to be helpful for the study of Galactic remnants.\n\nEven within the extincted region near the Galactic center Miras remain visible due to their high intrinsic luminosity.  Since optically dim stars do not produce strong radio emission (Stellar photospheres of dwarf stars are essentially\nundetectable with current radio telescopes), expanding the survey sample to less luminous objects provides little value for the study of black holes.  Nevertheless, the deeper magnitude limits of future surveys will permit the inclusion of regions of high extinction, i.e., dark areas of the bulge, in survey fields \\citep{extinction}, marginally increasing the number Miras that can be monitored.  This may be ameliorated by operating microlensing surveys in the infrared as well.\n\nMuch more important is the expanded sky coverage.  We have already assumed that the entire Galactic bulge will be monitored in our previous rate estimate.  Further increasing the number of monitored Miras substantially in an optical survey necessarily requires expanding the surveys beyond the bulge.  Moderate modifications to the observing strategies of existing optical surveys present an obvious way in which radio-bright microlensing event rates can be substantially increased.  Because Miras are intrinsically luminous, they lie well above the detection threshold of all ongoing microlensing surveys located anywhere within the Galaxy.  Therefore, the relative paucity of Miras does suggest an alternative strategy: broad and shallow instead of narrow and deep.\n\nIncluding the Galactic disk is expected to grow the Mira sample by a factor of $\\approx 6$-$7$ assuming the stellar population does not vary widely between the bulge and the disk.  Hence, we expect $\\approx 4 \\times 10^6$ Miras in total within Milky way.  Unfortunately, the microlensing optical depth in the disk is roughly a third of that of the bulge as a result of the former's smaller stellar density.  Taking into account the smaller optical depth in the disk a survey that monitors the entire Galactic plane to a magnitude limit of 15 would capture radio-bright microlensing events at a rate of $37~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$, corresponding to a radio-bright black hole microlensing events at a rate of $1.3~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$. This is sufficient to double the number of known Galactic black holes within less than two decades.\n\nImportantly, these survey strategies need not be exclusive.  Since the objects of primary interest for radio imaging, black holes, result in long-duration microlensing events, even sparse time sampling is sufficient (on the order of once per week).  The OGLE~IV survey has already adopted such a strategy, monitoring the entire Galactic disk with a cadence of 1-2 days and the bulge with a cadence $\\lesssim1$~hr \\citep{2015AcA....65....1U}.\n\n\\subsection{Far-future Optical Microlensing Surveys}\nThe LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) is a 8.4 meter telescope equipped with a wide field camera with 9.6 square degrees field of view. It will provide a deep survey of southern sky (over 20000 square degrees) giving 1000 exposures of each patch during 10 years of observations. The optimal cadence of the survey for different areas of the sky is yet to be determined.  The single exposure depth in r-filter will be $\\approx 24.5~ \\rm{mag}$ and it can yet go deeper ($\\approx 26.5~ \\rm{mag}$) by co-adding the images.   Being a ground base survey the angular resolution is limited by seeing (0''.7) and ultimately by its pixel size (0''.2) \\citep{2008arXiv0805.2366I}.\n\nThe mean cadence of $3-4~ \\rm{days}$ is much shorter than the typical time-scales of the long duration black hole lensing events. Furthermore the deep survey combined with the fact that Mira variables are bright stars guarantees that most of the Mira lensing events in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC will be detected by LSST.  Thus, for finding black hole lensing events amenable to radio imaging, the LSST presents a similar capability to current generation microlensing surveys operated with modified observation strategy.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Future Radio-Continuum  Microlensing Survey}\nWere a microlensing survey performed in the radio directly the need to identify optically-bright radio counterparts would be eliminated altogether, resulting in the finding of events that are amenable to radio imaging with a near 100\\% efficiency. Moreover such a radio survey would permit monitoring the much more numerous compact continuum radio sources. With the advent of a number of rapid-survey radio telescopes (e.g., the Square Kilometre Array \\citealt{taylor07}, Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment \\citealt{2014SPIE.9145E..22B}, etc.), enabling rapid nearly all-sky surveys, high-cadence radio transient searches will become common.  A radio microlensing survey is a natural byproduct of these.\n\nThe stringent requirements on source size ($\\lesssim 1~{\\rm mas}$) restricts the potential radio microlensing survey source targets to stars (e.g., Miras) or primarily extragalactic objects.  The details of the lens parameter estimation are only weakly dependent on the distance to the radio source; placing sources at extragalactic distances decreases the Einstein angle by at most 30\\%.  \n\nMore important is the over-all number of sources, which directly translates into the predicted rate enhancement.  These, in turn, depend on the flux limit and wavelength of interest, both set by the VLBA.  For a $10\\,M_\\odot$ black hole lens multiple image components are easily visible by the VLBA for frequencies above 3~GHz, providing a natural upper limit of 10~cm on the observation wavelength.  For 10~min integration times with 500~MHz bandwidths the VLBA flux limit should be near 20~$\\mu$Jy and 40~$\\mu$Jy at 22~GHz and 43~GHz, respectively; where required we adopt a flux limits of 30~$\\mu$Jy.\\footnote{We assume system-equivalent flux densities are roughly 500~Jy and 1000~Jy at 22~GHz and 43~GHz, respectively.}  Large-amplification events will reduce the effective flux limit further.  As we will see below, either improvements in the sensitivity of the VLBA or new radio-bright source classes will be necessary to leverage a radio microlensing survey.\n\nRadio-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide a natural class of sources, being both numerous, and more importantly compact.  Conveniently, they are also typically flat-spectrum radio sources, meaning that neither the source identification nor the subsequent microlensing survey need be performed at the same wavelengths at which the events are ultimately imaged.  Thus, to estimate the number of potential sources above the VLBA flux limit we employ the NRAO VLA Sky Survey at 1.4~GHz reported in \\citet{1998AJ....115.1693C} \\citep[though see also][]{1984ApJ...287..461C,2012ApJ...758...23C} finding roughly $1.6\\times10^7$ and $1.5\\times10^8$ radio-bright AGN in ellipticals and spirals, respectively, with fluxes above above 30~$\\mu$Jy.\n\nThese are distributed isotropically, and thus a large fraction of AGN will be visible at high Galactic latitude with correspondingly smaller lensing optical depth. As a result, the average lensing optical depth for an AGN survey to that for the optical surveys that monitor the Galactic bulge alone is approximately $0.01$.  Thus, despite having nearly 290 times the number of targets, a radio microlensing survey of objects above 30~$\\mu$Jy would produce a black hole microlensing event rate 1~${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, about the same as that from Mira-based optical surveys.  \n\nTo obtain an event rate of 10~${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, doubling the number of know black holes in two years, requires a flux limit of 3~$\\mu$Jy.  This is would require corresponding improvements in the VLBA.  However, in principle this may be achieved via an extended integration time combined with an expanded bandwidth.  Currently, 4~GHz bandwidths supported by 16~Gbps recorders are planned stations participating in millimetre-wavelength VLBI observations \\citep{2012arXiv1210.5961W}, and could be deployed to VLBA stations for use at centimetre wavelengths.  Combined with 2~hr integration times, these reach the 3~$\\mu$Jy flux limit needed.  Below 3~$\\mu$Jy the number of sources scale approximately as $N_{>S}\\propto S^{-0.5}$, and thus further growth in the number of sources is a slow function of flux limit.\n\n\n\\mbox{}\\\\\n\\section{Radio VLBI Event Reconstruction}\\label{sec:radio}\n\nMotivated by the prospect of substantial number of optical microlensing events amenable to radio imaging, we now present illustrative examples of what these may look like for typical event parameters, and discuss the precision with which the event parameters may be reconstructed.\n\n\\subsection{Models of Resolved Masers}\n\nSiO masers at $\\approx43$~GHz ($\\approx7$~mm) have routinely been detected\naround late-type giants in the central parsec of the Galaxy \\citep{2003ApJ...587..208R}.\nLocated within the extended atmospheres of Miras, these are typically\nwithin 8~AU of their parent, corresponding to an astrometric offset\nof 1~mas in the Galactic center.

For black hole lenses the angular sizes of these structures are typically smaller than $\\theta_E$, and thus multiple spots are likely to be strongly lensed simultaneously.  For less massive lenses the ring angular angular scale and $\\theta_E$ may be more similar.  Nevertheless, because the emission between maser spots remains incoherent\\footnote{This is distinct from, e.g., for pulsars, which produce many {\\em coherent} spots due to scintillation within the interstellar medium, and therefore require careful consideration of wave-optics effects \\citep{2014MNRAS.440L..36P}.}. the resulting lensed image is a linear superposition of a number of individual spots.   Thus, here we consider the simpler problem of a single masing spot to assess the size of the constraints that can be placed on the lens in principle.\n\nNet velocity offsets between the star and masing spots are systematically incorporated into the radio source velocities and thus do not present an additional systematic uncertainty.  However, the masing spots can also evolve in size and luminosity.  Both are unlikely to produce substantial complications since it doesn't impact the separation of the lense images (see Section \\ref{sec:pe}).  While the latter can complicate the determination of the radio light curve, this may be ameliorated via the optical light curve.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Generating Mock Images}\nTime sequences of mock images are generated via a multi-step process:\nbeginning with the specification of the positions of the source, lens,\nand observer, the mapping of the source to the image plane via the\nthin-lens equation, and convolution with a realistic beam.\n\nOver the duration of a lensing event, the position of the source and\nlens are assumed to evolve with a fixed velocity:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 47486, "prevtext": "\n  \\item A lens component (bulge, disk, spheroid) is randomly chosen according to the local densities of each at $D_L$.\n  \\item A lens component type (star, white dwarf, black hole) is randomly chosen according to the local fraction of each for the given component.\n  \\item A lens mass is selected according to the total mass function of the chosen component modified by the approximate lensing cross section; for a fixed observing time the probability of detecting a lens is $\\propto \\theta_E \\propto M^{1/2}$.\n  \\item A lens velocity is the sum of the bulk Galactic motion for the chosen component and a random contribution pulled from a Gaussian distribution with the appropriate dispersion (listed in Table \\ref{tabmodel}).\n  \\end{enumerate}\n\\item Detection efficiency cut: Given the lens mass, source and lens velocities, and source and lens positions $t_E$ is computed, and the event is accepted with a probability set by the OGLE detection efficiency.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe result is a set of lensing events with known intrinsic properties (source and lens masses, distances, velocities, and types) selected using a realistic microlensing survey biases.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure3.eps}\n\\caption{Distribution of microlensing events in Einstein \ncrossing time from Monte-Carlo simulation. The detection efficiency of OGLE IV survey is applied during event selection. The fraction of black hole events to the overall events is $0.035$ and weighted heavily towards long $t_{\\rm E}$.}\n\\label{te_sim}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nFigure \\ref{te_sim} shows the distribution in Einstein crossing time of simulated events.  Since in the simulation we flag lenses that are either main sequence or remnants and, we can classify lenses based on lens type.  Here we compare the overall microlensing events with those produced by black holes specifically; the fraction of events with black hole lenses is $0.035$.\nThis fraction is comparable to the estimate of \\citet{gould2000}, which finds 0.01 assuming a 100\\% detection efficiency, and thus neglecting the higher detection efficiency of Mira events.\n\nAnother important point is the average $t_E$ for the overall events and black hole events are 38~days and 127~days, respectively.  This is unsurprising since the duration of events scales with lens mass as $M^{1/2}$, and is an immediate consequence of the fact that the average black hole mass is roughly an order of magnitude larger than that of the overall sample.  Hence, black hole lensing events are typically more than three times longer than the typical microlensing event, with important consequences for identification and parameter estimation.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure4.eps}\n\\caption{Distribution of lens positions in galaxy for various lens populations.  Contributions of the disk (solid) and bulge (dashed) are shown separately; the spheroid contribution is negligible.}\n\\label{ND_sim}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigure \\ref{ND_sim} shows the distribution of lens locations in our simulated survey for each of the Galactic components and lens types.  Events are dominated by lenses within the disk (65\\%) with the remainder from the bulge (35\\%); the spheroid contributes negligibly.  Of note is that the lens distribution within the disk is nearly evenly distributed between the bulge and a heliocentric distance of 2~kpc, implying that microlensing surveys necessarily probe the lens population throughout the intervening disk.  This remains true independent of the lens type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Radio-Bright Microlensing Event Rates} \\label{sec:rates}\n\nKey to the radio imaging of microlensing events is the identification of radio-bright lensed sources.  In the near term this requires the identification of candidate events based on their optical properties alone.  Here we discuss the rates implied by the previous section employing surveys that exploit optical counterparts of radio bright sources (i.e., Mira variables) and the potential rates from future radio microlensing surveys.  This is ultimately dependent on the population and distribution of candidate sources.\n\n\\subsection{Miras as Microlensing Sources}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{Figure5.eps}\n\\caption{Color-Magnitude diagram for OGLE III Microlensing events.  Half of the stars in the red box are likely to be Mira variables. The small blue line inside the red box shows how much a MIII giant will move in HR diagram as a result of blending with a solar type (G2V) lens star located half way between the source and observer.}\n\\label{goodCMD}\n\\end{figure}\n\nMiras provide a natural class of optically bright sources with strong radio emission in the form of circumstellar SiO masers.  In most microlensing surveys Miras have already been identified due to their variable nature.  Where they have not, they are readily identified in the optical color magnitude diagram. (Figure \\ref{goodCMD}).  Importantly, there is little chance for source confusion -- blending of source and lens stars does not move objects appreciably within the region populated by Miras.\n\nThe variable nature of Miras provide an immediate impediment to their use as microlensing survey targets; typical Miras vary with periods of $\\approx 1~\\mathrm{yr}$, I-band variability amplitudes between $1.4~{\\rm mag}$ and $3~{\\rm mag}$ \\citep{Soszynski13}, and V-band variability amplitudes typically two--three times larger \\citep{1990gcvs.book.....K}.  However, black hole microlensing events can be easily distinguished from the intrinsic variability as a result of three important differences.  All of these may be exploited in part due to the high luminosity of Miras, and therefore the high photometric accuracy with which they may be monitored.\n\nFirstly, microlensing light curves have a well-understood and uniform structure set by the lens-source geometry and nature of gravitational lensing, characterized by a divergent rise as the source approaches the lens caustics (moderated by the finite source size).  This differs starkly from the smooth intrinsic variations of Miras.  Thus careful light curve fitting should be able to rapidly distinguish between microlensing and intrinsic variability.\n\nSecond, the amplitude of the flux variation during microlensing events is typically larger than that due to intrinsic variability.  Typical magnifications are of order 450\\%, while high-magnification events can exceed an 1000\\%.  These correspond to magnitude variations of $1.5~{\\rm mag}$ and $2.5~{\\rm mag}$, comparable the that caused by intrinsic variations in I-band.  Hence, the microlensing signal is an order unity modification of the underlying source variability in I-band.  At longer wavelengths the intrinsic variability decreases further, on average variations in the magnitude at 1.25~$\\mu$m are 20\\% of those at optical wavelengths \\citep{2002AJ....123..948S}\\footnote{ There are instances for which near-infrared variability is nevertheless sizable, e.g., R Cas, where the amplitude of variations at 1.25~$\\mu$m are as large as 1.42~mag.  However, the variability continues to drop rapidly with increasing wavelength.}.\n\nThirdly, the flux variations due to microlensing are achromatic.  Again this is in stark contrast to the intrinsic variability of Miras, which varies dramatically with wavelength. Thus, multi-band monitoring should be readily able to disentangle the two variability components.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Bulge Miras Microlensing Rates}\n\nThe OGLE III survey monitored approximately $150$ million stars in Galactic bulge from 2001 to 2009 in search for gravitational microlensing events and provided us with the largest catalogue of microlensing events available.  OGLE used the Early Warning System (EWS) to detect ongoing microlensing events \\citep{earlyw}. EWS uses Difference Image Analysis photometry and by analyzing all the stars in the field flags the potential microlensing events \\citep{alard}.  In doing so it currently identifies and filters out variable stars. The flagged stars go through several tests including a visual inspection of the light curve and after satisfying all the criteria they are announced as a microlensing candidate.\n\nWe used OGLE III microlensing alerts data (2002 - 2009) to find the relative number of Mira-type candidates, demonstrating their high detection efficiency (though note that all Miras will have been excluded). Of all the $4052$ events $2015$ had both V and I magnitudes available which were used for our analysis.  The events which only have I band measurements would not have a substantial contribution to M III stars, since they are mainly faint stars.  Figure \\ref{goodCMD} shows the CMD for these events together with the box to select type M III stars. \nThese are a few orders of magnitude brighter than M-dwarfs, increasing their representation in microlensing surveys.  An advantage of using bright stars is that blending by background and lens stars do not affect the brightness of the source star significantly (Figure \\ref{goodCMD}). Moreover, from the lens equation, and estimating the mass of the lens star, we can calculate the contribution of blending and correct the position of source star in CMD \\citep{muraki,miyake}.\n\nWithin the OGLEIII catalogue there are currently $6528$ Miras \\citep{Soszynski13}.  The larger number of Miras inferred in the bulge suggest that this can be readily enlarged by surveying the entire bulge region.  Estimates based on the OGLEII catalogue suggest as many as $\\approx 6 \\times 10^5 $ Miras in Galactic Bulge \\citep{Matsunaga05}.  The large luminosities of Miras implies a near unity detection efficiency, and thus as discussed around equation (\\ref{eq:Nevents}), we anticipate a total bulge-Mira microlensing event rate of $11~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$.  Therefore, monitoring the Galactic Bulge alone will produce $\\approx 0.4$  black hole microlensing events per year associated with a radio-bright source, enabling radio imaging.\n \n\n\\subsection{Current and Near-future Optical Survey Microlensing Rates}\nAt least two future microlensing surveys are underway, exceeding OGLE III in three ways: higher cadence, deeper magnitude limits, and increased sky coverage.  OGLE IV, in operation since 2010, has a bulge field of $\\approx 330~ \\mathrm{deg}^2$, 3.3 times larger than that of OGLE III.  The resulting OGLE IV EWS event rate is three times larger than that of OGLE III; OGLE III EWS detected about $650$ events in 2008 whereas OGLE IV EWS detected almost $2000$ events in 2013 and over $2000$ in 2014.  The forthcoming The Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) consists of three dedicated $1.6~\\mathrm{m}$ telescopes located in Australia, South Africa, and South America, each with $4~ \\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of view.  Thus, KMTNet anticipates detecting $\\approx 2300$ microlensing events per year with constant cadence of almost 10~min \\citep{kmt2014}.\n\nThe high luminosity of Miras and the long time-scales of black hole microlensing events imply that the first two, higher cadence and deeper magnitude limits, will at best produce modest improvements in the Mira microlensing rate.  High cadences will vastly over-sample black hole microlensing light curves, and thus while important for planet searches are unlikely to be helpful for the study of Galactic remnants.\n\nEven within the extincted region near the Galactic center Miras remain visible due to their high intrinsic luminosity.  Since optically dim stars do not produce strong radio emission (Stellar photospheres of dwarf stars are essentially\nundetectable with current radio telescopes), expanding the survey sample to less luminous objects provides little value for the study of black holes.  Nevertheless, the deeper magnitude limits of future surveys will permit the inclusion of regions of high extinction, i.e., dark areas of the bulge, in survey fields \\citep{extinction}, marginally increasing the number Miras that can be monitored.  This may be ameliorated by operating microlensing surveys in the infrared as well.\n\nMuch more important is the expanded sky coverage.  We have already assumed that the entire Galactic bulge will be monitored in our previous rate estimate.  Further increasing the number of monitored Miras substantially in an optical survey necessarily requires expanding the surveys beyond the bulge.  Moderate modifications to the observing strategies of existing optical surveys present an obvious way in which radio-bright microlensing event rates can be substantially increased.  Because Miras are intrinsically luminous, they lie well above the detection threshold of all ongoing microlensing surveys located anywhere within the Galaxy.  Therefore, the relative paucity of Miras does suggest an alternative strategy: broad and shallow instead of narrow and deep.\n\nIncluding the Galactic disk is expected to grow the Mira sample by a factor of $\\approx 6$-$7$ assuming the stellar population does not vary widely between the bulge and the disk.  Hence, we expect $\\approx 4 \\times 10^6$ Miras in total within Milky way.  Unfortunately, the microlensing optical depth in the disk is roughly a third of that of the bulge as a result of the former's smaller stellar density.  Taking into account the smaller optical depth in the disk a survey that monitors the entire Galactic plane to a magnitude limit of 15 would capture radio-bright microlensing events at a rate of $37~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$, corresponding to a radio-bright black hole microlensing events at a rate of $1.3~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$. This is sufficient to double the number of known Galactic black holes within less than two decades.\n\nImportantly, these survey strategies need not be exclusive.  Since the objects of primary interest for radio imaging, black holes, result in long-duration microlensing events, even sparse time sampling is sufficient (on the order of once per week).  The OGLE~IV survey has already adopted such a strategy, monitoring the entire Galactic disk with a cadence of 1-2 days and the bulge with a cadence $\\lesssim1$~hr \\citep{2015AcA....65....1U}.\n\n\\subsection{Far-future Optical Microlensing Surveys}\nThe LSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) is a 8.4 meter telescope equipped with a wide field camera with 9.6 square degrees field of view. It will provide a deep survey of southern sky (over 20000 square degrees) giving 1000 exposures of each patch during 10 years of observations. The optimal cadence of the survey for different areas of the sky is yet to be determined.  The single exposure depth in r-filter will be $\\approx 24.5~ \\rm{mag}$ and it can yet go deeper ($\\approx 26.5~ \\rm{mag}$) by co-adding the images.   Being a ground base survey the angular resolution is limited by seeing (0''.7) and ultimately by its pixel size (0''.2) \\citep{2008arXiv0805.2366I}.\n\nThe mean cadence of $3-4~ \\rm{days}$ is much shorter than the typical time-scales of the long duration black hole lensing events. Furthermore the deep survey combined with the fact that Mira variables are bright stars guarantees that most of the Mira lensing events in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC will be detected by LSST.  Thus, for finding black hole lensing events amenable to radio imaging, the LSST presents a similar capability to current generation microlensing surveys operated with modified observation strategy.\n\n\n\\subsection{A Future Radio-Continuum  Microlensing Survey}\nWere a microlensing survey performed in the radio directly the need to identify optically-bright radio counterparts would be eliminated altogether, resulting in the finding of events that are amenable to radio imaging with a near 100\\% efficiency. Moreover such a radio survey would permit monitoring the much more numerous compact continuum radio sources. With the advent of a number of rapid-survey radio telescopes (e.g., the Square Kilometre Array \\citealt{taylor07}, Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment \\citealt{2014SPIE.9145E..22B}, etc.), enabling rapid nearly all-sky surveys, high-cadence radio transient searches will become common.  A radio microlensing survey is a natural byproduct of these.\n\nThe stringent requirements on source size ($\\lesssim 1~{\\rm mas}$) restricts the potential radio microlensing survey source targets to stars (e.g., Miras) or primarily extragalactic objects.  The details of the lens parameter estimation are only weakly dependent on the distance to the radio source; placing sources at extragalactic distances decreases the Einstein angle by at most 30\\%.  \n\nMore important is the over-all number of sources, which directly translates into the predicted rate enhancement.  These, in turn, depend on the flux limit and wavelength of interest, both set by the VLBA.  For a $10\\,M_\\odot$ black hole lens multiple image components are easily visible by the VLBA for frequencies above 3~GHz, providing a natural upper limit of 10~cm on the observation wavelength.  For 10~min integration times with 500~MHz bandwidths the VLBA flux limit should be near 20~$\\mu$Jy and 40~$\\mu$Jy at 22~GHz and 43~GHz, respectively; where required we adopt a flux limits of 30~$\\mu$Jy.\\footnote{We assume system-equivalent flux densities are roughly 500~Jy and 1000~Jy at 22~GHz and 43~GHz, respectively.}  Large-amplification events will reduce the effective flux limit further.  As we will see below, either improvements in the sensitivity of the VLBA or new radio-bright source classes will be necessary to leverage a radio microlensing survey.\n\nRadio-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide a natural class of sources, being both numerous, and more importantly compact.  Conveniently, they are also typically flat-spectrum radio sources, meaning that neither the source identification nor the subsequent microlensing survey need be performed at the same wavelengths at which the events are ultimately imaged.  Thus, to estimate the number of potential sources above the VLBA flux limit we employ the NRAO VLA Sky Survey at 1.4~GHz reported in \\citet{1998AJ....115.1693C} \\citep[though see also][]{1984ApJ...287..461C,2012ApJ...758...23C} finding roughly $1.6\\times10^7$ and $1.5\\times10^8$ radio-bright AGN in ellipticals and spirals, respectively, with fluxes above above 30~$\\mu$Jy.\n\nThese are distributed isotropically, and thus a large fraction of AGN will be visible at high Galactic latitude with correspondingly smaller lensing optical depth. As a result, the average lensing optical depth for an AGN survey to that for the optical surveys that monitor the Galactic bulge alone is approximately $0.01$.  Thus, despite having nearly 290 times the number of targets, a radio microlensing survey of objects above 30~$\\mu$Jy would produce a black hole microlensing event rate 1~${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, about the same as that from Mira-based optical surveys.  \n\nTo obtain an event rate of 10~${\\rm yr}^{-1}$, doubling the number of know black holes in two years, requires a flux limit of 3~$\\mu$Jy.

However,\nthis scattering is highly localized, occurring only for sources in the\nimmediate vicinity of the Galactic center, and unlikely to limit the\nresolution attainable by efforts to image Miras throughout the\nGalactic bulge.  \n\nTypical intrinsic sizes for nearby SiO individual maser spots are\n1~AU, corresponding to $\\approx0.1$~mas at $\\approx8$~kpc distance, and therefore also unlikely\nto significantly limit the resolution of VLBA observations.  \nWe ignore the impact of intervening scatter broadening and model the\nintrinsic emission from an individual spot by a Gaussian intensity\nprofile with a FWHM of $0.1$~mas:\n\n", "index": 23, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nI_{\\rm int}(\\bm{\\beta}) = I_0 e^{-\\left|\\bm{\\beta}\\right|^2/2\\sigma_{\\rm spot}^2}\\,,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E12.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"I_{\\rm int}(\\bm{\\beta})=I_{0}e^{-\\left|\\bm{\\beta}\\right|^{2}/2\\sigma_{\\rm spot%&#10;}^{2}}\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mi>int</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\ud835\udf37</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>I</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mrow><msup><mrow><mo>|</mo><mi>\ud835\udf37</mi><mo>|</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>/</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><msubsup><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>spot</mi><mn>2</mn></msubsup></mrow></mrow></msup></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05801.tex", "nexttext": "\nrespectively.

For black hole lenses the angular sizes of these structures are typically smaller than $\\theta_E$, and thus multiple spots are likely to be strongly lensed simultaneously.  For less massive lenses the ring angular angular scale and $\\theta_E$ may be more similar.  Nevertheless, because the emission between maser spots remains incoherent\\footnote{This is distinct from, e.g., for pulsars, which produce many {\\em coherent} spots due to scintillation within the interstellar medium, and therefore require careful consideration of wave-optics effects \\citep{2014MNRAS.440L..36P}.}. the resulting lensed image is a linear superposition of a number of individual spots.   Thus, here we consider the simpler problem of a single masing spot to assess the size of the constraints that can be placed on the lens in principle.\n\nNet velocity offsets between the star and masing spots are systematically incorporated into the radio source velocities and thus do not present an additional systematic uncertainty.  However, the masing spots can also evolve in size and luminosity.  Both are unlikely to produce substantial complications since it doesn't impact the separation of the lense images (see Section \\ref{sec:pe}).  While the latter can complicate the determination of the radio light curve, this may be ameliorated via the optical light curve.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Generating Mock Images}\nTime sequences of mock images are generated via a multi-step process:\nbeginning with the specification of the positions of the source, lens,\nand observer, the mapping of the source to the image plane via the\nthin-lens equation, and convolution with a realistic beam.\n\nOver the duration of a lensing event, the position of the source and\nlens are assumed to evolve with a fixed velocity:\n\n", "index": 25, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\bm{x}_S = \\bm{x}_{s,0} + \\bm{v}_S t\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n\\bm{x}_L = \\bm{x}_{L,0} + \\bm{v}_L t\\,,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E13.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\bm{x}_{S}=\\bm{x}_{s,0}+\\bm{v}_{S}t\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\bm{x}_{L}=\\bm{x}_{L,0}%&#10;+\\bm{v}_{L}t\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi><mi>S</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc97</mi><mi>S</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>t</mi></mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mtext>and</mtext></mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi><mi>L</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc99</mi><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>,</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc97</mi><mi>L</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>t</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05801.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe lens geometry is then fully defined by the distances\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 49898, "prevtext": "\nrespectively.

A time-sequence of images for our fiducial\ncase is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:bhi}, covering nearly a year.  Since\nthe minimum impact parameter is small in comparison to $\\theta_E$,\nmultiple images are present.  Because $\\theta_E$ is also considerably\nlarger than the intrinsic source and beam sizes, these are well\nresolved, suggesting that detecting and interpreting the features of\nstrong lensing by black holes will be straightforward.  In particular,\na direct measurement of $\\theta_E$ is possible simply by fitting the\nspot separations, though we defer to how well this may be done in\npractice to Section \\ref{sec:pe}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{Figure7.eps}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{Example $1~M_\\odot$ stellar microlensing event.

Where these differ most dramatically is near peak\nmagnification (center panel in Figures \\ref{fig:bhi} and\n\\ref{fig:wdi}); the more massive lens produces correspondingly larger\ndistortions in the image as a result of the better resolution of the\nEinstein ring.  The microlensing event is also significantly shorter.\n\nThe effect of the accelerated observer frame, due to the Earth's\norbital motion, is evident in the asymmetric entrance and exist from\nthe microlensing event.  However, this effect may be confused with\nfeatures arising from the impact of the asymmetric beam and arbitrary\nevent orientation.  Thus in Figures \\ref{fig:bhi} and \\ref{fig:wdi} we\nhave also shown by the red contours the images with the Earth's\norbital motion neglected.  From these it is clear that asymmetry in\nthe temporal evolution of the image structure at early and late times\nis a robust indicator of parallax.\n\n\n\\subsection{Parameter Estimation} \\label{sec:pe}\n\n\nThe primary parameters of interest are those of the lens: mass,\nvelocity, distance.

As a result, radio imaging of microlensing events can\nprovide the novel ability to produce a large sample of stellar remnants with\nknown masses, positions (including distances), and velocities.  Importantly,\nthis sample would not suffer from the standard biases that plague studies\nbased on binaries; the selection effects associated with microlensing\nsurveys are well understood and can be modeled and removed.  This enables\na variety of probes of astrophysical phenomena, which we discuss here.\n\n\n\\subsection{Massive Star Evolution}\n\n\nThe large event rates enables the systematic\nconstruction of a black hole mass function over a decade.  For radio\nmicrolensing surveys (see below) this rate can be an order of\nmagnitude larger.  Unlike X-ray binaries, for microlensing the\nobserving biases are well understood and can be addressed via\ndirect modeling, resulting in an accurate representation of the mass\ndistribution of stellar mass black holes in the Milky Way.\n\nThe mass distribution of black holes would be immediately diagnostic\nof the dynamics of core collapse supernovae, the cataclysmic events\nsurrounding their formation.  Typically, accretion of fallback\nmaterial produces a mass gap between neutron stars and black holes, a\nregion of relative paucity in the black hole mass function extending\nto masses well above $2M_\\odot$\n\\citep{1996ApJ...457..834T,2002RvMP...74.1015W,2008ApJ...679..639Z}\n. In all cases, key uncertainties in the stellar evolution (e.g.,\nwind loss rates, supernovae energetics, etc.) impact the final mass\ndistributions \\citep{gallart05}. There have been studies on the effect of variations in neutrino \nmechanism for core collapse supernovae on the theoretical black hole mass function \n\\citep{2015ApJ...801...90P} and using the observed black hole mass function there already have been   \nconstraints on core collapse supernova \\citep{2015MNRAS.446.1213K}.  \nFor compact binary systems, the location and depth of the mass gap is\nfurther sensitive to the binary evolution history\n\\citep{2002ApJ...578..335F}.\nWhile tentative evidence for a mass gap has already been reported based on\nthe inferred masses of black holes in X-ray binaries\n\\citep{Ozel10}, this is necessarily subject to\nthe variety of strong selection effects and substantial uncertainties\nmentioned above.\nMoreover, studies of X-ray binaries are fundamentally limited by the\nsmall number of binaries currently known.\n\nIn contrast, radio-imaged microlensing events provide a means to\nsystematically accrue large, debiased samples of Galactic black holes,\nlimited only by survey duration.  Thus, it offers both a method to\nassess the poorly known biases inherent in X-ray binaries and\nultimately to directly access key elements of massive star evolution.\n\nFurthermore, radio-imaged microlensing events will produce estimates of the\nlens positions and tangential velocities.  Thus, together with the\nmass function it is possible in principle to construct a Galactic\nblack hole distribution function.  The velocity distribution will\nnecessarily be strongly impacted by the dynamics of core collapse\nsupernovae via supernova kicks \\citep{Willems05}, as well as the subsequent\nevolution of the Galactic remnant population.\\footnote{While the\n  dynamical relaxation time of   the Galaxy is of order \n  $10^4~{\\rm Gyr}$, black holes are much more  massive than the\n  typical Galactic object, and thus can have relaxed substantially.}\n\nGalactic black holes also serve as a fossil record of massive star\nformation.  Therefore, detailed comparisons of the\nlocal\\footnote{Necessarily accounting for potentially significant \ndifferences in relaxation rates.} densities of stellar mass black\nholes, white dwarfs, and sub-solar stars yield an estimate of the\npotentially temporally and spatially varying stellar initial mass\nfunction.  In particular, this provides a unique ability to constrain\nthe history of the high-mass end of the initial mass function.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Gravitational Wave Experiments}\n\nThe measurement of the mass of a single isolated stellar-mass black\nhole would provide an important calibration for population synthesis\ncomputations, performed primarily to produce rate estimates for\ngravitational wave detectors \\citep{belczynski02}.  This is the consequence of the\ntypical nature of lenses in contrast to the particular\nevolutionary history of X-ray binaries, currently used to calibrate\nthe variety of uncertainties in the rate estimates.  \n\nMore generally, the binarity rate and source distribution are key\ninputs into black hole binary gravitational wave source population\nestimates.\nHigh-mass X-ray binaries, the objects likely progenitors of the black\nhole-black hole binaries visible by experiments like LIGO \\citep{abadie10}, are\nnecessarily young by virtue of the large mass of the secondary,\nproviding a strong bias towards populations associated with the recent\nstar formation history of the Milky Way.  In stark contrast, binary\nmergers are expected to occur very long times after their formation,\nand therefore indicative of the integrated star formation history of\nthe Milky Way.\nThe detection of a black hole-black hole binary presents a\nmeans to study the binary black hole population over the entirety of\nthe Galactic history.  Unfortunately, the lower limit on the projected\nbinary separation for which radio-imaged microlensing events can\nefficiently detect binarity (roughly 1~mas at 8~kpc) corresponds to orbital\nperiods of years, and thus will not present candidate gravitational\nwave sources.  Nevertheless, it would provide a significant calibration\nof binary formation rates, and therefore black hole-black hole binary\npopulations.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Isolated Neutron Stars}\n\nThus far we have focused primarily on black hole lenses.  Nevertheless,\nit is possible to directly detect solar mass objects as well.  While we\nhave included a discussion of the white dwarf lensing rates we have\nlargely ignored lensing events from isolated neutron stars.  An estimate\nof the neutron star lensing rate is nevertheless possible using the black\nhole lensing rate.  The two key assumptions are that the massive stellar\nprogenitors of black holes and neutron stars follow a Salpeter initial mass\nfunction and that the neutron stars receive kicks during formations.\n\nFrom the first we estimate the ratio of the total number of Galactic neutron\nstars to the total number of Galactic black holes:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 65116, "prevtext": "\nAssuming the uncertainty in $\\theta_E$ is negligible and in $D_S$ is of order 10\\%, the fractional uncertainty in $M$ is given by that in $\\lambda$, and thus the mass can be estimated with an accuracy of roughly 14\\%.\nThe lens transverse velocity is given by\n\n", "index": 55, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\bm{v}_L = D_L \\bm{\\omega}_L\\,.\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E28.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\bm{v}_{L}=D_{L}\\bm{\\omega}_{L}\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc97</mi><mi>L</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mi>L</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msub><mi>\ud835\udf4e</mi><mi>L</mi></msub></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05801.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $M_{\\rm ZNS}\\approx8\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm ZBH}\\approx21\\,M_\\odot$\nare the minimum zero-age main-sequence masses of stars that form neutron\nstars and black holes, respectively \\citep{2002RvMP...74.1015W}.\n\nThe second assumption modifies the volume occupied by neutron stars.

Nevertheless,\nit is possible to directly detect solar mass objects as well.  While we\nhave included a discussion of the white dwarf lensing rates we have\nlargely ignored lensing events from isolated neutron stars.  An estimate\nof the neutron star lensing rate is nevertheless possible using the black\nhole lensing rate.  The two key assumptions are that the massive stellar\nprogenitors of black holes and neutron stars follow a Salpeter initial mass\nfunction and that the neutron stars receive kicks during formations.\n\nFrom the first we estimate the ratio of the total number of Galactic neutron\nstars to the total number of Galactic black holes:\n\n", "index": 57, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\frac{N_{\\rm NS}}{N_{\\rm BH}}\n  \\approx\n  \\left(\\frac{M_{\\rm ZNS}}{M_{\\rm ZBH}}\\right)^{-1.35}\n  \\approx\n  4\\,,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E29.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{N_{\\rm NS}}{N_{\\rm BH}}\\approx\\left(\\frac{M_{\\rm ZNS}}{M_{\\rm ZBH}}%&#10;\\right)^{-1.35}\\approx 4\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>NS</mi></msub><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>BH</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2248</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>ZNS</mi></msub><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>ZBH</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1.35</mn></mrow></msup><mo>\u2248</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mn>4</mn></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.05801.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere we have used typical values $v_{\\rm kick}\\approx400~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ and\n$v_{\\rm circ}\\approx200~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$.  Thus, neutron stars formed in the Galactic\nbulge will be distributed across a volume nearly 400 times larger than similarly\nformed black holes, and thus exhibit a number density 400 times smaller.\nThe net result is that for typical numbers the rate of neutron star microlensing\nevents is expected to be roughly 1\\% of that for the black holes, justifying our\nneglect of neutron stars.\n\nHowever, we caution that this conclusion is extremely sensitive to the typical\nkick velocities.  If the typical kick velocity is $300~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ the neutron\nstar lensing rate rises to 10\\% of the black hole lensing rate.  More importantly,\nif the neutron star kick velocity distribution contains a low-velocity tail or is\nbimodal, as suggested by the large number of known Galactic neutron stars\n\\citep[see, e.g.,][]{1998ApJ...496..333F,2005ASPC..328..327P}, the bulge may\nretain a large fraction of neutron stars originally formed within it.  In this\ncases the neutron star and black hole lensing rates can be comparable.  Thus, the\nrelative frequency of neutron star and black hole events provides an additional\nprobe of the distribution of neutron star formation kicks.\n\nIf large numbers of neutron star lensing events are observed, radio-imaged\nmicrolensing provides a novel way in which to directly measure the neutron star\nmass function, independent of the biases inherent in the study of neutron star\nbinaries.  Unfortunately, given their large typical age ($\\gtrsim1~{\\rm Gyr}$)\nthese are all likely to be exceedingly dim, with luminosities of\n$\\approx10^{-11}$-$10^{-9}L_\\odot$, and therefore not amenable to direct size\nmeasurements, complicating any effort to directly constrain the high-density\nnuclear equation of state.\n\nNominally, these objects would also fall below the death line for typical\npulsar magnetic field strengths ($10^{12}~{\\rm G}$) and periods (1~s).

Thus, radio imaging enables the reconstruction of the lens parameters to better than 15\\% accuracy.  The dominant source of this remaining uncertainty is due to the unknown distance and velocity of the lensed source, and thus these may be improved by roughly an order of magnitude by follow-up observations that constrain the source's proper motion and distance.  Furthermore, imaging provides an immediate method to detect binary lenses, albeit within a rather narrow range of orbital separations (corresponding to periods of roughly $2~{\\rm yr}$--$20~{\\rm yr}$.

Moderate modifications to existing survey strategies, some of which are already pursued by OGLE-IV, should produce events amenable to radio imaging at a rate of $\\approx~40~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$.  Of these, assuming the Galactic black hole population arises solely via the evolution of massive stars, roughly $1.3$ will due to black holes.  This rate will increase substantially if black holes compose a significant fraction of the Galactic dark matter budget.\n\nDetections of Galactic black holes via microlensing provides an unbiased sample of massive star remnants.  The existing sample of stellar mass black holes, obtained via observations of X-ray binaries, necessarily suffers from strong, uncertain biases associated with the formation and evolution of tight massive-star binaries.
