For a given $q$,\nthere is a minimal $R_c$ for which the instability has enough\ntime to act and change the components of the spins along $\\hat{L}$.\nWe call this minimal radius $R_{eff}$. By inserting $r/M=R_{eff}$ \ninto equation (\\ref{eq:Omega0}) we can solve the resulting\nquadratic equation for \n$\\alpha_2^B(q,\\alpha_{1L})=\\alpha_2^\\pm(q,\\alpha_{1L};R_{eff})$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:a2B}\n\\alpha_2^B(q,\\alpha_1)&=&\\frac{(1-q^2)\\sqrt{R_{eff}}-q(1+q^2)\\alpha_{1L}}{3-q^2}\\cr\n&&\\mp\\frac12\\frac{(1-q^2)}{(3-q^2)}\\sqrt{C},\\\\\nC&=&16q^2\\alpha_{1L}^2-2(1-q^2)R_{eff}+8(q^2-3),\\cr\n&&-8q\\sqrt{R_{eff}}(1+2q-q^2)\\alpha_{1L}/(1-q).\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray}\nApplying this formula to the border of the\ndepopulated regions in Fig.~\\ref{fig:qCases}\nleads to a simple fit to all $q$-cases studied giving \n\n$R_{eff}=(26.2-18.6\\,q)/(1-q)$.\nThis $R_{eff}$ is larger for $q\\sim1$ than for $q\\sim1/2$ since the\nsmaller the mass ratio the longer it takes radiation reaction to shrink\nthe binary as the energy radiated near merger \nscales roughly with $\\eta^2=q^2/(1+q)^4$ \\cite{Healy:2014yta}. \nThis shows that the instability acts on a radiation reaction time scale \n(bringing the binary towards merger) rather\nthan the shorter precession time scale (or the much shorter orbital scale).\nWe observe that above $q=0.85$ the second root $\\alpha_2^B$,\nbegins to also limit the upper part of the panel. \nIn the $q=1$ limit the two $\\alpha_2^\\pm$ roots agree, merging into\na diagonal straight line, representing the fact that there is no instability\nfor $q=1$, i.e. only flip-flop oscillations with \n$\\Omega_{ff}(q=1)=\\frac32\\frac{S_0}{r^3}$ (see Eq.~(\\ref{eq:Omega0})).\n\n\nWe thus obtain an analytic expression for the portion of\nthe aligned spin binaries parameter space that the instabilities remove from \nan initial uniform distribution.\nThese priors affect the conditional probability distribution and\nhave consequences for the determination\nof posteriors distributions of parameter estimation techniques applied to\nbinary black hole candidates to be observed by advanced LIGO \n\\cite{TheLIGOScientific:2014jea}.\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\it Full Numerical Evolutions:}\nPost-Newtonian evolutions do not accurately account for the\nfinal plunge, merger and ringdown of binary black holes.\nWe hence stopped our PN evolutions at a fiducial separation of $r=11M$.\nWe have then performed a few representative full numerical simulations\nusing the techniques in \\cite{Campanelli:2005dd} to follow \nup those post-Newtonian integrations.\nThe details of the five simulations are given in Table~\\ref{tab:ID}.\n\n\\begin{widetext}\n\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Initial data parameters and system details for full numerical\nevolutions.

Particularly challenging to model are highly\nprecessing effects near merger. These effects depend strongly\non the spin orientations and magnitudes of each individual black hole.\n\nThe strongest dynamical effect of the spins on the orbit of\nBBH is the hangup effect \\cite{Campanelli:2006uy}, that depending\non the spin components along the orbital angular momentum \n(aligned or counteraligned) delays\nor prompts the merger of BBH with respect to the nonspinning case.\n\nTwo recent studies shed light on interesting effects of spin precession:\ni) the individual spin of a black hole may totally flip directions\nalong the orbital angular momentum during the latest inspiral phase \nof the BBHs \\cite{Lousto:2014ida,Lousto:2015uwa} \nand ii) for certain antialigned configurations the black hole spin\ncomponents along the orbital angular momentum are unstable under\nangular perturbations \\cite{Gerosa:2015hba}.\n\nIn this letter we provide a unified description of these two \nphenomena which gives new insight on the origin of the misalignment\ninstability and confirms its existence in higher post-Newtonian\nexpansions and full numerical simulations. We also discuss some\nof the consequences of this phenomenon for astrophysical modeling,\ngravitational waves parameter estimation, and computation of\ngravitational recoils.\n\n\n{\\it Post Newtonian

found using\norbit averaging~\\cite{Schnittman:2004vq}, \nan effective low post-Newtonian order technique.\nHere we perform a study of these spin dynamics by numerically\nintegrating higher

integrations start from quasi-circular orbits at a large enough initial binary\nseparation such that the spins are stable, ie $r/M>R_c$ given in \nEq.~(\\ref{eq:Rc})  (with the total mass of the system $M=m_1+m_2$),\nand we stop at a fiducial $r=11M$.\nWe choose the spin of the large black hole $\\vec{S}_2=\\vec{\\alpha}_2m_2^2$\ninitially aligned with the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$

misalignments).\nThe instability occurs either when the larger or the smaller (or both) \nblack hole spin is slightly misaligned with $\\hat{L}$.\nThe instability depopulates the upper left corner of the spin parameter\nspace, with successively larger portions from $q=0.5$\nto $q=1$, and strongly changes the spin components along $\\hat{L}$\nbringing the binary system to strong precession.\n\nFrom the initial large separations, when the system is stable and\nspins oscillate at the flip-flop frequency, $\\Omega_{ff}$,\nthe binary separation shrinks due to gravitational radiation and eventually\nreaches a critical separation, see upper panel in Fig.~\\ref{fig:FFtoI}.\nAt this point the polar oscillations of the spin\nbegin to grow fast in an out-spiral fashion (see lower panels).\n\nAs seen in the middle panels of Fig.~\\ref{fig:FFtoI}, the spin\nmisalignment reaches large values\nat later times (and smaller separations), but the\ncosine of the angles $\\theta_{1L}$ and $\\theta_{2L}$ that\nthe spins form with $\\hat{L}$-direction bare a relation\nthat preserves (mostly) $\\vec{S}_0\\cdot\\hat{L}$\nas expected \\cite{Racine:2008qv}, i.e. $q\\cos\\theta_{1L}+\\cos\\theta_{2L}=1-q$. \n\nWe will show next\nthat the critical radii separating the two regimes can be described\nin terms of the vanishing of the {\\it flip-flop} frequency,
