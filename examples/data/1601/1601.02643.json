As the flux is varied, the smooth evolution of the rings' current is interrupted by abrupt transitions. These transitions correspond to discrete changes in the winding number of the superconducting order parameter. We find that the smooth evolution of the current and the locations of the abrupt transitions are in quantitative agreement with Ginzburg-Landau theory in the full magnetic field range and over a wide span of temperature and ring size. We also find that the transitions always correspond to unit changes in the winding number. The dynamics of these transitions is not well understood, but appears to reflect strong damping of the order parameter in nucleating phase slips.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{}\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\\email{ ivana.petkovic@yale.edu}\n\n\nSuperconductivity in reduced dimensions is strongly influenced by  fluctuations. One-dimensional superconducting wires acquire finite resistance through the process of phase slips, in which the order parameter goes temporarily to zero at some point along the wire, accompanied by a phase jump of  2$\\pi$ \\cite{little}. This type of fluctuation can be thermal close to the critical temperature \\cite{langer_ambegaokar} or quantum at low temperature \\cite{giordano,duan}. In some cases quantum phase slips can be coherent \\cite{buchler}. Coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) are a topic of fundamental interest as a dual to the Josephson effect \\cite{mooij_nazarov} and have potential applications in quantum computing \\cite{mooij_harmans}.\n\nThe majority of experiments on phase slips have focused on thermal and incoherent quantum phase slips and have used transport measurements of the subgap resistance of thin wires \\cite{giordano,taps_exp,qps_exp1,qps_exp2,qps_exp3,qps_exp4,qps_exp5,qps_exp6,qps_exp7,qps_exp8,qps_exp9,qps_exp10}. Some experiments have studied CQPS using microwave spectroscopy \\cite{astafiev1,astafiev2}, but have left a number of open questions. In contrast to these approaches, dispersively coupling a closed mesoscopic system to a high quality resonator can provide a non-invasive and well-characterized way to study  these phenomena, and allows access to the intrinsic behavior of equilibrium states  and their associated fluctuations.\n\nWe consider a uniform superconducting ring enclosing an externally imposed magnetic flux $\\Phi$. Within a mean-field picture, the state of the ring is described by the complex-valued order parameter $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r})$, whose phase acquires a $\\Phi$-dependence.\nIf the ring's lateral dimensions are smaller than the superconducting coherence length $\\xi$ and penetration depth $\\lambda$, then  $\\Psi$ will be a function only of $s$, the coordinate along the ring's circumference.\nThe boundary condition imposed by the ring requires that $\\Psi(s)= \\Psi(s + 2 n\\pi \\! R)$, where $R$ is the ring's radius and $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is the winding number of the order parameter.\nIn this one-dimensional limit and within the semiclassical description the ring's equilibrium states are uniquely specified by $n$ \\cite{little,tinkham}.\n\nThe equilibrium properties of such a system have three distinct temperature regimes, which are set by the ratio of the ring's radius $R$ to the temperature-dependent $\\xi$. For temperature $T$ only slightly below the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ such that $2R<\\xi$, the ring is in a superconducting state for some values of $\\Phi$ while for the other values it is in the normal state \\cite{little_parks}.\nThis is due to competition between the superconducting condensation energy and the flux-imposed kinetic energy of the supercurrent.\nAt slightly lower $T$ such that $\\xi<2R<\\sqrt{3}\\,\\xi$, the condensation energy is always larger than (but of the same order as) the kinetic energy and for each value of $\\Phi$ the ring has exactly one superconducting state.\nFinally, at even lower $T$ such that $2R>\\sqrt{3}\\,\\xi$, the condensation energy is many times larger than the kinetic energy and at a given $\\Phi$ several equilibrium states, each with different $n$, are available to the system.\n\nThese equilibrium states correspond to the local minima of the free energy functional $F[\\Psi(s)]$ and are separated from each other in the configuration space of $\\Psi(s)$ by barriers whose heights depend upon $\\Phi$  \\cite{langer_ambegaokar,mccumber_halperin}.\nThe presence of multiple local minima in the free energy landscape means that the ring's state depends upon its history.\nTransitions between equilibria (i.e., changes in $n$, or phase slips), may occur via thermal activation over a barrier \\cite{langer_ambegaokar}, quantum tunneling through a barrier \\cite{giordano,duan,matveev}, or by varying $\\Phi$ to tune the barrier height to zero \\cite{tarlie_elder}.\nThe first two processes have been measured in rings that incorporate weak links (such as Josephson junctions) \\cite{kurkijarvi,rouse,schwartz_lukens,corato}, but are not readily observed in uniform superconducting rings.\nThe third process, in which the barrier is made to vanish, is the focus of this paper. A detailed study of metastable current-carrying states and the barriers which separate them constitutes an important first step towards the study of thermal and quantum phase slips in uniform rings.\n\n\n\nThe Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expression for $ F[\\Psi(s)]$ was used to calculate the free energy of the equilibrium states $F_n$  \\cite{langer_ambegaokar,mccumber_halperin,zhang}, as well as the values of $\\Phi$ at which the barrier vanishes and the corresponding state becomes unstable \\cite{langer_ambegaokar,tuckerman,kramer_zimmermann}.\nThis calculation predicts that as $\\Phi$ is varied, the ring's equilibrium current $I_n = - \\partial F_n / \\partial\\, \\Phi$ and heat capacity $C_{V,n} = -T \\partial^2 F_n / \\partial T^2$ undergo sawtooth-shaped oscillations in which the smooth portions correspond to evolution at fixed $n$, while the sharp jumps correspond to changes in $n$.\nSince stationary GL theory does not describe the dynamics of the transition, it does not predict which state the ring will occupy after a transition if there is more than one possibility (i.e., in the lowest temperature regime described above).\nIn principle this question may be addressed by simulating the transition dynamics via the time-dependent GL equation or other methods \\cite{karttunen_tarlie, tarlie_elder, tarlie_shimshoni_goldbart,vodolazov_peeters,dulac,mckane_tarlie}.\n\t\n\n\nMeasurements of $I(\\Phi)$ \\cite{pedersen,vodolazov, unpublished_moler,bert_moler,koshnick_moler,bluhm_moler} and $C(\\Phi)$ \\cite{bourgeois,bourgeois_prb} have found qualitative agreement with the features described above.\nHowever, quantitative agreement was found only for $T$ very close to $T_c$ \\cite{bert_moler,bluhm_moler,koshnick_moler,zhang,bourgeois_prb}. For lower $T$ the detailed shape of $I(\\Phi)$ and the values of $\\Phi$ at which the irreversible jumps occur were found to disagree with the predictions of stationary GL theory \\cite{pedersen,vodolazov,unpublished_moler}, and the change in $n$ at each transition has not been reproduced by dynamical simulations  \\cite{karttunen_tarlie, tarlie_elder, tarlie_shimshoni_goldbart,vodolazov_peeters,dulac,mckane_tarlie}.\n\n\n\nHere we describe measurements of $I(\\Phi)$ in isolated one-dimensional aluminium rings. These measurements employ cantilever torque magnetometry, and cover a wide range of ring dimensions, applied flux, and temperature $T_{\\mathrm{c}}/2 < T < T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (the range over which GL theory is expected to be accurate). We find quantitative agreement between the data and GL theory regarding the form of $I(\\Phi)$ and the values of $\\Phi$ at which the winding number transitions occur. The parameters extracted from this analysis agree well with the known properties of microfabricated Al, and with the temperature dependence of $\\xi$ and $\\lambda$ described by the commonly-used empirical approximation \\cite{tinkham}.\n\nFour separate samples were measured. All of the samples were fabricated by depositing a single Al layer of thickness $d = 90$ nm onto a lithographic pattern. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements, each sample consisted of an array of $\\sim 10^3$ nominally identical rings. The sample properties are listed in Table \\ref{tabela}. Each array is fabricated on a Si cantilever of length $\\sim 400\\; \\mu$m, thickness 100 nm and width $\\sim 60 \\;\\mu$m, with resonant frequency $f \\sim 2$ kHz, spring constant $k \\sim 1$ mN/m and quality factor $ Q \\sim 10^5$.

A uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied normal to the rings' equilibrium orientation.

To examine the location of these phase slips quantitatively, we define $d\\phi_n=\\phi_n-\\phi_{\\mathrm{min},n}$, where $\\phi_n$ is the experimental value of the normalized flux $\\phi = \\Phi/\\Phi_0$ at which the transition $n \\rightleftarrows n+1$ occurs, and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{min},n}$ is the value of $\\phi$ at which $F_n$ reaches its minimum value. As defined, $d\\phi_n$ are positive when $B$ is increasing and negative when $B$ is decreasing. (In the following we normalize all flux values by $\\Phi_0$ and denote them by minuscule letter $\\phi$.)\n\nOur next step is to compare the experimental values of switching flux $d\\phi_n$ with theory. In the Langer-Ambegaokar picture, valid for a current-biased wire much longer than $\\xi$, the barrier between states $n$ and $n+1$ goes to zero when bias current reaches critical current $I_c$ \\cite{langer_ambegaokar}. In the case of a flux-biased ring, still for $R\\gg \\xi$, this occurs at normalized flux\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\n\n", "index": 3, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{c},n}=\\phi_{\\mathrm{min},n}+\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{3}\\,\\xi}+O\\left(\\left(\\frac{w}{R}\\right)^2\\right),\n\\label{lala}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E2.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\phi_{\\mathrm{c},n}=\\phi_{\\mathrm{min},n}+\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{3}\\,\\xi}+O\\left(\\left%&#10;(\\frac{w}{R}\\right)^{2}\\right),\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\u03d5</mi><mrow><mi>min</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub><mo>+</mo><mfrac><mi>R</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msqrt><mn>3</mn></msqrt></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03be</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>w</mi><mi>R</mi></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02643.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\n\\noindent These two switching fluxes are shown in Fig. \\ref{free_energy}(b)-(d) for an arbitrary $n$. To simplify comparisons with experiment  we define $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{c},n}=\\phi_{\\mathrm{c},n}-\\phi_{\\mathrm{min},n}$ and $d\\phi_n^*=\\phi_n^*-\\phi_{\\mathrm{min},n}$.\n\nFigure \\ref{switching} shows measured $d\\phi_n$ as function of $n$.\nThe vertical axis in Fig. \\ref{switching} is normalized to $d\\phi^*\\equiv d\\phi_{n=0}^*$. We chose this normalization because the limit $n=0$ is equivalent to neglecting the rings' width (i.e., taking $w\\rightarrow 0$), which simplifies the expression for $d\\phi_n^*$. As a result of this choice, the quantity shown in Figure \\ref{switching} ($d\\phi_n/d\\phi^*$) is expected to equal 1 for small $B$ and to diminish as $B$ approaches $B_{\\mathrm{c}3}$ (or as $n\\rightarrow n_{\\mathrm{max}}$).\n\nThe horizontal axis in Fig. \\ref{switching} is normalized to the experimentally observed maximum winding number $n_{\\mathrm{max}}$ (different for each sample), where $n_{\\mathrm{max}}\\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{3}R^2}{w \\xi}$. The ratio $n/n_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is very close to $B/B_{\\mathrm{c}3}$.\nEach panel shows data for a different $R$ at several temperatures. The data is given in four panels for clarity.\nIn the Supplemental Material we show this data in a single panel and demonstrate that with this scaling all of the data collapses together.\nThe bars represent the width of the steep portion of the sawtooth oscillations in Figs. \\ref{current} and \\ref{current_one}. As discussed in the Supplemental Material, this width is due to small inhomogeneities within the arrays.\n\nThe solid lines in Fig. \\ref{switching} show the theory prediction $d\\phi_{n}^*/d\\phi^*$ (see Eq. (\\ref{kz})), whereas dotted lines show $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{c},n}/d\\phi^*$ (Eq. (\\ref{lala})). The difference between the two increases with the ratio $\\xi(T)/R$ and is therefore the most pronounced for small rings (top panel) or at high temperature due to the increase of $\\xi(T)$ (all panels, high temperature).\nWe see that the prediction $d\\phi_{n}^*/d\\phi^*$, which includes the finite-circumference effect ($R\\gtrsim \\xi$), agrees well with the measured switching locations over the full range of $T$, $B$, and $R$. The largest disagreement occurs for the largest rings (bottom panel) at low temperature; this discrepancy is likely due to the increased importance of the rings' self inductance (which is ignored in our analysis) in this regime.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centerline{\\hbox{\n\\epsfig{figure=Petkovic_Figure6,width=85mm}}}\n\\caption{ Supercurrent per ring $I$ as function of magnetic field $B$ for rings with radius $R=288$ nm and temperature $T=861$ mK.\nRed points: increasing $B$; blue points: decreasing $B$.\nThe regions over which $I(B)$ diminishes at fixed winding number are indicated by black arrows. }\n\\label{pudding}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn addition to this quantitative impact, the finite-circumference effect can also be seen directly in Fig. \\ref{pudding}, which shows measured $I(B)$ over a narrow range of $B$ for the smallest rings. For both increasing $B$ (red) and decreasing $B$ (blue) each sawtooth oscillation reaches a maximum current, and then starts to diminish before the switching occurs. The regions over which $I(B)$ diminishes (at fixed $n$) are indicated by black arrows.\n\nIn these regions the velocity is super-critical (see Fig. \\ref{free_energy}(d)), but the diminishing density leads to the decrease of current. This effect is only accessible in the the ring configuration.\nBoth in a current-biased wire and in a flux-biased ring  the phase of the order parameter at equilibrium is $\\phi=k s$, where $k$ is a wave-vector, and current is $I\\propto k(1-k^2)$ \\cite{langer_ambegaokar,zhang}. The boundary condition for the wire is $kL=2\\pi n$, where $L$ is the wire length, and for a ring $kL+2\\pi \\phi=2\\pi n$, where $L=2\\pi R$. When biasing a wire with current $I<I_c$, $k$ is not uniquely determined  since $I \\propto k(1-k^2)$ has multiple solutions,  and the system will always chose the value of $k$ in the stable region (non-shaded area in Fig. \\ref{free_energy}(b)-(d)). (Here \"stable\" refers to the long wire/ring diameter limit). In contrast, when biasing a ring with flux, $k$ is uniquely  determined (through the boundary condition), and therefore it is possible to bias the system in the shaded region, which corresponds to the regions indicated by black arrows in Figure \\ref{pudding}.\n\nThe winding number transitions described above take place when the barrier confining an equilibrium state vanishes. When this occurs, $\\Psi(s)$ evolves dynamically until it relaxes to a new local minimum of $F[\\Psi(s)]$. Unless $T$ or $B$ is close to a critical value, there are typically multiple minima into which the system may relax. Despite this freedom, we measure that the winding number always changes as $|\\Delta n| = 1$. This is seen for all values of $R$, $B$, and $T$ (down to the lowest value $T=460$ mK). In contrast, previous experiments have all found $|\\Delta n| > 1$ for low $B$ and low $T$ \\cite{pedersen,vodolazov,unpublished_moler}. One notable feature of these previous experiments is that the rings had larger $R$ and $w$ than those studied here.\nFurthermore, the results of Refs. \\cite{pedersen,vodolazov,unpublished_moler} together with the results presented here show a clear trend in which $\\Delta n$ decreases as $R$ and $w$ are decreased at low temperature.\n\nWe note that transitions with small $\\Delta n$ would be expected when the order parameter is strongly damped, as strong damping will tend to cause the system to relax into a nearby equilibrium configuration. We speculate that the observed trend indicates that the damping of the order parameter is greater for thinner rings. We also speculate that the rings studied here are overdamped, ensuring that when a local minimum disappears the system relaxes to the adjacent minimum, i.e., such that $|\\Delta n| = 1$.\n\nIn conclusion, we have measured the transitions of the winding number in flux-biased uniform one-dimensional superconducting rings. We have shown that the instability is reached as predicted by stationary Ginzburg-Landau theory. This detailed knowledge of the instability condition should enable  systematic study of thermal and quantum phase slips near to the instability. This study can also be extended to rings formed from superconductor/normal metal bilayers \\cite{ora}, where the dynamics of quasiparticles created by phase slips is of interest for qubit decoherence \\cite{michel}.\n\nWe thank Michel Devoret, Zoran Radovi\\'{c}, Hendrik Meier, Richard Brierley, Konrad Lehnert, Amnon Aharony and Ora Entin-Wohlman for useful discussions, and Ania Jayich and Will Shanks for fabricating the samples.

An example of raw data taken for a ring with radius $R=406$ nm at temperature $T=762$ mK is shown in Figure \\ref{data_t}(a). Red trace corresponds to the sweep up of bias field and blue to the sweep down. In addition to the sawtooth oscillations associated with the rings' superconductivity, we observe that $f$ also undergoes a small drift as a function of time and of $B$. To remove this background, we fit the data above the rings' critical field to a third-order polynomial, which is shown as the black curve in Fig. \\ref{data_t}(a). We subtract this fit from $f$ to obtain the frequency shift $df$ due to the magnetic moment of the rings (Figure \\ref{data_t}(b)).\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n \\centerline{\\hbox{\n\\epsfig{figure=Petkovic_Supplemental_Material_Figure1,width=170mm}}\n}\n\\caption{(a)  Raw data, cantilever frequency shift as function of field for increasing $B$ (red) and decreasing $B$ (blue) for the rings with radius $R=406$ nm and $T=762$ mK. Third order polynomial background is shown as the black curve. (b) Cantilever frequency shift after background substraction and averaging. The signal is due to the magnetic moment of the supercurrent.\n}\n\\label{data_t}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Supercurrent as function of field}\n\n\n\nIn our measurement configuration  the magnetic field is perpendicular to the rings' surface and the frequency shift is related to supercurrent $I$ as $df(B)=\\kappa \\, I(B)\\, B R^2 \\pi$, where $\\kappa$ is a cantilever-specific constant \\cite{ania_science,wills_thesis}.  This constant depends on the cantilever's resonant frequency, spring constant, length and the number of rings on it. The resonant frequency is measured in the phase-locked loop, the length is measured by optical imaging, and the number of rings is known from the lithography pattern. The spring constant $k$ is obtained as a fitting parameter of the Ginzburg-Landau fit, as explained in the Main text and here in the following section. The best-fit value is within 20$\\%$ of the nominal value computed as $k=(2\\pi \\!f)^2 m_{\\rm eff}$, where $m_{\\rm eff} = m/4$ is the effective mass of the cantilever and $m$ is the cantilever's actual mass. The rings' radius is also obtained from the Ginzburg-Landau fits. It is highly constrained by the period of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, with the result that the statistical error on the best-fit value is $\\approx 1$ nm. The values returned by this fit agree well with the values measured by SEM observations.\n\nThe supercurrent obtained from the frequency shift as $I(B)=df(B)/( 2 \\pi \\kappa R^2 B)$ is shown in Figure \\ref{ib_cl}. Every panel shows data measured on a sample with a different ring size in the full available temperature range.\n\n\\begin{figure}[p]\n\\centerline{\\hbox{\n\\epsfig{figure=Petkovic_Supplemental_Material_Figure2,width=110mm}}}\n\\caption{Measured supercurrent per ring as function of field for different samples with  $R=780,538,406,288$ nm (top panel to bottom panel), in the full temperature range.\nLower curves of the same color correspond to increasing $B$ and upper ones to decreasing $B$. }\n\\label{ib_cl}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe signal becomes very noisy close to zero field, and is not displayed for $B$ very close to 0. This is because $I \\propto df/B$ and for fields close to zero, dividing the signal $df$ by $B$ leads to unreliable results.\n\n\\subsection{Ginzburg-Landau fit for a one dimensional ring with finite width}\n\nWe fit the data using one dimensional Ginzburg-Landau theory which includes the effects of finite ring width. More specifically, the expression for supercurrent is given as Eq. (7) in \\cite{zhang}. From this expression we compute the frequency shift and fit it to the $df$ data.\n\nTo do this, we first identify the winding number of each segment of $df(B)$. For the measurements taken with increasing $B$, we count the number of segments (i.e., the regions of smoothly varying $df$ between jumps) between $B_{\\rm c3}$ and $-B_{\\rm c3}$. This number is $2 n_{\\rm max}+1$, where $n_{\\rm max}$ is the maximum winding number. We thus determine $n_{\\rm max}$. Then we start from $B_{\\rm c3}$ and count down from $n_{\\rm max}$ to zero. We apply the equivalent process to measurements taken with decreasing $B$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n \\centerline{\\hbox{\n\\epsfig{figure=Petkovic_Supplemental_Material_Figure3,width=170mm}}\n}\n\\caption{Supercurrent per ring as function of perpendicular field for different ring sizes (columns) and temperatures (marked on each panel).

Thin black dotted curves: the Ginzburg-Landau fit, extended over the full field range of each winding number.\n}\n\\label{ifit1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\vspace{2mm}\n \\centerline{\\hbox{\n\\epsfig{figure=Petkovic_Supplemental_Material_Figure4,width=170mm}}\n}\n\\caption{Supercurrent per ring as function of perpendicular field for different ring sizes (columns) and temperatures (marked on each panel).

Thin black dotted curves: the Ginzburg-Landau fit, extended over the full field range of each winding number.\n}\n\\label{ifit2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs explained in the Main text, it is a global fit which fits the entire $I(B)$ measurement (i.e., for all winding numbers and for $B$ increasing and decreasing). The fitting parameters are: superconducting coherence length $\\xi$, penetration depth $\\lambda$, ring radius $R$, ring width $w$ and the spring constant $k$. Of these, we expect $R$, $w$ and $k$ to be fixed for each sample (i.e., to not change with temperature), so we first undertake a preliminary fit to determine these three parameters.\nIn these preliminary fits, there is a degeneracy between $\\lambda$ and $k$, since they both set the amplitude of the signal: $\\lambda$ affects the condensation energy, and therefore the amplitude of the current, while $k$ affects the proportionality constant $\\kappa$ between current and frequency shift. Therefore we first set the starting value $k_{\\rm in}$ to its calculated nominal value (using the expression given in the preceding section) and $\\lambda_{\\rm in}$ such that $B_{\\rm c0}$ (the zero temperature bulk critical field, set by the product of $\\xi_0$ and $\\lambda_0$, where zeroes denote the zero temperature value) is 0.01 T, as expected for aluminium \\cite{tinkham}. Then we run the fit for each of the $I(B)$ measurements (i.e., at different $T$) for that sample. We then fix $k$ to be the mean of the values returned by these preliminary fits. Values for $R$ and $w$ are fixed in the same way: by picking the mean of the values obtained from fits at different temperatures. The scatter between the obtained values for $k$, $R$ and $w$ at different temperatures is rather small (a few percent for $k$ and $w$ and less than 1 nm for $R$).\n\nIn the second round of the fit only two fitting parameters remain, $\\xi$ and $\\lambda$. Note that $\\xi$ also affects the condensation energy, and therefore the amplitude of the signal, but it is not degenerate with $k$ and $\\lambda$ since it is very accurately set by the rings' critical field $B_{\\rm c3}\\sim \\xi^{-1}$, as detailed in the Main text. This is in a sense lucky because our subsequent conclusions on the switching flux value hinge on the precise determination of $\\xi$. This can be seen from Eqs. (1) and (2) in the Main text which show that the switching flux criteria depend only on $R$ and $\\xi$.  Another remark is that here we simply take $\\lambda$ as the fitting parameter (a number at each temperature) and the subsequent analysis of its temperature dependence reveals that it is in fact the Pearl penetration depth $\\lambda_P$.\n\nWe have made measurements for $T > 400$ mK. We have tried fitting below 750 mK ($\\sim T_c/2$) but we have found that the values of $w$, $\\lambda_0$ and $\\xi_0$ don't converge to a fixed value like they do for $T>750$ mK. We expect the Ginzburg-Landau theory to be valid roughly above $T_c/2$ and this is confirmed by the fit.\n\nThe result of the measurement and the Ginzburg-Landau fit are shown in Figures \\ref{ifit1} and \\ref{ifit2}, where data is shown as points connected by thin curves and the fit is shown as thick curves. Three temperatures spanning the whole measured range are shown for each ring size. Red curves on each panel are for sweep up and blue for sweep down. The dotted black curves show the fit results extended over the full  field range for each winding number; note that the portion of the dotted black curve occupied when $B$ is increasing (red) is different from the part occupied for when $B$ is decreasing (blue) in the hysteretic part of $I(B)$.\n\n\nThe most pronounced discrepancy between the data and the fit is found for the biggest ring at the lowest temperatures, top left panel of Fig. \\ref{ifit1}, where the ring's self-inductance $L$ starts to play a role. In this regime, we estimate $L I \\sim 0.13\\, \\Phi_0$ in that case, which may lead to non-negligible skewing of the rings' current-phase relation \\cite{fink_grunfeld}. For the rest of the measurements considered here, the effects of  $L$ are unimportant, i.e. $LI \\ll \\Phi_0$. For smallest to largest ring size we have computed the expected $L = 0.5 - 2.3$ pH. This gives $L I \\sim 0.03, 0.05,0.07,0.13 \\,\\Phi_0 $  respectively at $ 750$ mK. At higher temperatures $LI$ is less since  $I$ decreases with temperature.\n\n\n\\subsection{Transition width}\n\nWe have also studied the width of the jumps from one winding number to another, which is non-zero since the measurement is performed on an array of rings. The result is shown in Figure \\ref{width} where the transition widths are given as function of the winding number $n$, proportional to $B$, for all ring sizes and temperatures.\nWe see that the transition widths have a non-zero value at $n=0$ and increase roughly linearly with $B$. The slope of the $B$-dependence is independent of $T$ and decreases with $R$.  It is consistent with lithographic imprecision of 1 - 2 nm (the exact number for radius variation $dR$ is given in the box of each graph) within each array of nominally identical rings.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centerline{\\hbox{\n\\epsfig{figure=Petkovic_Supplemental_Material_Figure5,width=160mm}}\n}\n\\caption{Observed transition width in units of normalized flux $d\\Phi/\\Phi_0$ as function of winding number $n$, for different ring sizes and temperatures. Solid lines indicate a linear fit to the whole data set at each ring size. Value $dR$ is the radius variation which would lead to the slope of the fit. Value $\\Phi_{n=0}$ is the extrapolated transition width at zero field, obtained from the fit. Radius sizes are: (a) $R=780$ nm, (b) $R=538$ nm, (c) $R=406$ nm and (d) $R=288$ nm.\n}\n\\label{width}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe transition width at zero field also shows no discernible temperature dependence. It is a factor of $5-10$ larger than expected from the rings' mutual inductance, which results in rings at the middle of an array seeing a slightly different field than those at the edge.\nExtrapolating the linear behavior of the transition width to zero field gives $\\Phi_{n=0}$, which is seen to increase with $R$.\n\t\nWe conclude from these observations the rings' temperature does not influence the transition widths in measurements of these arrays. This is consistent with the fact that the transition width expected for thermal switching across a barrier \\cite{mccumber_halperin} is estimated to be several times less than the observed width.\n\n\\subsection{Scaling of the phase slip flux}\n\nAs mentioned in the Main text, Figure 5 is divided into four panels for clarity. Here it is given as a single figure, which demonstrates that the chosen normalization leads to the scaling of all data. The dotted lines from Figure 5, which showed the prediction for the switching flux in the case of $R\\gg\\xi$, are omitted here, as well as the bars indicating the transition width. Full lines show the prediction for the switching flux in the relevant case of $R\\gtrsim \\xi$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centerline{\\hbox{\n\\epsfig{figure=Petkovic_Supplemental_Material_Figure6,width=100mm}}\n}\n\\caption{Switching flux as function of the winding number. Dots: experimental values; full lines: prediction for the switching flux $d\\phi_n^*$ (see Main text). Colors represent temperature in the same way as in Figure 5 of the Main text. Ring sizes are denoted as: squares $R=780$ nm, circles $R=538$ nm, upward triangles $R=406$ nm and downward triangles $R=288$ nm.\n}\n\\label{scaling}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{ania_science} A.C.
