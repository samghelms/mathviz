Sputter deposition results in an effective quenching rate greater than $10^{10}$ K/s, allowing a broad range of alloys to be obtained in the amorphous state.\n\nNanocalorimetry measurements were performed on thin-film samples of the binary alloys using micromachined calorimetry sensors \\cite{mccluskey2010combinatorial,mccluskey2010nano,lee2013scanning,lee2014low}. \nThe measurements were performed in vacuum at nominal heating rates ranging from 2000 to 8500 K/s, and cooling rates of approximately 5000 K/s. \nAll samples were repeatedly heated to 1300 K to evaluate the crystallization behavior both in the as-deposited state and after melt/quenching. \nNanocalorimetry measurements reveal the glass transition, crystallization and liquidus temperatures. These quantities allow us to estimate GFA.\n\n\\begin{figure}[htb!] \n  \\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.49\\textwidth]{fig4.pdf}}\n  \\vspace{-6mm}\n  \\caption{\\small \n    {\\bf (a)} Nanocalorimetry measurements for NiZr during heating at different compositions. \n    The first heating cycle measurements for each composition are shown in red, and subsequent measurements are shown in black.\n    {\\bf (b)} Number of phases (solid black line) as measured using XRD, and $\\gamma$ descriptor calculated for NiZr alloys (dashed brown line). \n    {\\bf (c)} Contour plot of the entropic factor as a function of formation enthalpy (zero corresponds to the ground state of the composition). \n    Note the sharp peaks both in the number of states observed in experiment and in the entropic factor at the Ni$_{35}$Zr$_{65}$ and Ni$_{65}$Zr$_{35}$ compositions.} \n  \\label{fig4}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFigures \\ref{fig3}(a) and (b) show the nanocalorimetry results for the CuZr binary alloy with compositions in the bulk glass forming region. \nEach measurement consisted of two thermal cycles in which the thin-film samples were heated to above the melting point and then quenched. \nAll samples show clear signals corresponding to glass transition, crystallization, and melting when first heated from the as-deposited state, indicating that they were deposited in the amorphous state, Figure \\ref{fig3}(a).\nA better glass former has a lower critical cooling rate, so the amount of amorphous phase recovered after melt/quenching should scale with GFA. \nWe observe in Figure \\ref{fig3}(a) that the magnitude of the crystallization peak after the first thermal cycle changes significantly with composition: Cu$_{48.5}$Zr$_{51.5}$ has the strongest crystallization peak \nand is thus expected to have the highest GFA among the samples tested; Cu$_{55.5}$Zr$_{44.5}$ on the other hand has no discernable crystallization peak. \nThis result is confirmed by calorimetry measurements obtained after cooling from the melted state: \nthe heat released upon solidification results in an exothermic peak in the cooling curve; \nthe magnitude of this peak scales with the amount of crystalline phase formed on quenching and should be inversely proportional to the GFA, Figure \\ref{fig3}(b). \nThe experimentally observed number of phases and the amorphous phase thickness obtained from the casting experiments are shown in Figure \\ref{fig3}(c). \nThe calculated entropic factor, Figure \\ref{fig3}(d), can be compared with these two quantities, and the results show very good agreement between all methods that Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$ is the best glass forming composition.\n\n\nFigure \\ref{fig4} shows similar measurements for the NiZr alloy system, which has been shown to be a weak glass former \\cite{altounian1983crystallization,fukunaga2006voronoi}. \nAlthough as-deposited samples were amorphous and showed distinct crystallization peaks, subsequent melt/quenching did not produce any amorphous samples,\nand no crystallization peaks are observed in scans obtained after melting (Figure \\ref{fig4}(a)). Instead, we use $\\gamma = {T_x}/{(T_g+T_l)}$, defined in Ref. \\onlinecite{lu2002new} and shown in Figure \\ref{fig4}(b), \nas a less direct measure of GFA. Figures \\ref{fig4}(b) and (c) show strong correlation between the experimental measurements and the entropic factor descriptor.\nThere is a very weak GFA peak around Ni$_{35}$Zr$_{65}$ according to the experimental measurements, which is predicted to be around Ni$_{30}$Zr$_{70}$ by the entropic factor descriptor. \nA more pronounced peak is measured around Ni$_{65}$Zr$_{35}$, which is also successfully predicted in the same region by the entropic factor descriptor. \nThus, the new proposed predictor correlates well with the traditional empirical indicators of glass formation in metallic alloys, with an accuracy of the order of $5\\%$ in  composition, which is quite satisfactory.\nIn addition, comparing Figures \\ref{fig3}(c) and \\ref{fig4}(c), it is clear that the entropic facor exhibited by the high GFA alloy CuZr is significantly higher\nthan that shown by the low GFA NiZr alloy, thus correctly pointing out the more favorable alloy system for glass formation.\n\nIn conclusion, in this article we propose a simple computational descriptor for GFA. It is based on the number and energy features\nof distinct but competing crystalline phases near the ground state of a given metallic alloy.\nThe descriptor successfully differentiates the two experimentally studied test cases: a good and a bad glass-former,\nCuZr and NiZr respectively.\nIt thus exhibits the capability of providing predictions of glass formation potential from first principles computer\ncalculations, which would allow\nlarge scale high-throughput screening of the very large composition space available for glass forming alloys.\nSuch large scale computational studies\nshould reveal correlations that will contribute to a better understanding of the physics underlying glass formation, as well as accelerate the development of new BMGs.\n\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation under DMREF Grants No. DMR-1436151, DMR-1436268, and DMR-1435820.\nExperiments were performed in part at the Center for Nanoscale Systems at Harvard University (supported by NSF under Award No. ECS-0335765), \nat the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at Harvard University (supported by NSF under Award No. DMR-1420570), and\nat the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at Yale University (supported by NSF under Award No. DMR-1119826).\nCalculations were performed at the Duke University - Center for Materials Genomics.\nE.P., C.T. and S.C. acknowledge partial support by the Department of Defense - Office of Naval Research (N00014-13-1-0635, N00014-14-1-0526).\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\n\\bibitem{chen2015does}\nW.~Chen, J.~Ketkaew, Z.~Liu, R.~M. {Ojeda~Mota}, K.~O'Brien, C.~S. {da~Silva},\n  and J.~Schroers, \\emph{Does the fracture toughness of bulk metallic glasses\n  scatter?}, Scr.\\ Mater. \\textbf{107}, 1--4 (2015).\n\n\\bibitem{schroers2006amorphous}\nJ.~Schroers and N.~Paton, \\emph{Amorphous metal alloys form like plastics},\n  Advanced Materials \\& Processes p.~61 (2006).\n\n\\bibitem{Schroers_blow_molding_2011}\nJ.~Schroers, T.~M.

In this article, we propose a\nheuristic descriptor quantifying such confusion. It is based on the ``thermodynamic density of competing crystalline states'', parameterized\nfrom high-throughput {\\it ab-initio} calculations.\nThe existence of highly enthalpy-degenerate but geometrically-different phases frustrates the crystallization process and promotes glass formation. \nTwo test beds are considered.\nA good and a bad glass-former, CuZr and NiZr, are experimentally characterized with high-throughput synthesis. \nThe experimental results corroborate the capability of the heuristic descriptor in predicting glass forming ability through the compositional space. \nOur analysis is expected to deepen the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and to accelerate the discovery of novel metallic glasses.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle \n\n\nUnderstanding and predicting the formation of multicomponent bulk metallic glasses (BMG) is crucial for fully leveraging their unique\ncombination of superb mechanical properties \\cite{chen2015does} and\nplastic-like processability \\cite{schroers2006amorphous, Schroers_blow_molding_2011} for potential\napplications \\cite{Johnson_BMG_2009,Greer_metallic_glasses_review_2009,Schroers_Processing_BMG_2010}. It is also essential for\nefficiently identifying the most promising candidates out of the vast propective compositional space \\cite{ding2014combinatorial}.\nThe process underlining the formation of BMGs is still to be fully understood.\nIt involves a multitude of topological fluctuations competing during\nsolidification across many length scales \\cite{kelton1991crystal, egami2006formation, egami2011atomic}.\nLong-range processes, required by the typical non-polymorphic nature of the crystallization, and\natomic-scale fluctuations, precursors of short-range ordered competing phases\n\\cite{Busch_kinetics_BMG_2007}, are all pitted against each other and against glass formation \\cite{kelton1991crystal, kelton2010nucleation, kelton1998new}.\nSimulations of amorphous phases have been attempted to disentangle the mechanism of glass formation\n\\cite{sheng2006atomic,zhang2015glass,zhang2015origin,lee2003criteria,cheng2008relationship,cheng2009atomic,wang2015asymmetric},\nwithin reasonable system sizes, using classical and semi-empirical potentials.\nAlthough they have been successful in investigating the influence of factors such as the atomic size and packing on the glass-forming\nability (GFA), questions about the dynamics of the process still remain, especially considering all the approximations demanded for\nperforming long molecular dynamics simulations.\nFurthermore, adopting {\\it ab-initio} methods has been challenging:\neven while the most relevant metastable crystalline phases can be calculated and sorted by their energies\n\\cite{curtarolo:calphad_2005_monster,monsterPGM,curtarolo:art67,curtarolo:art53},\nthe zero-temperature formalism, lacking vibrational free energy \\cite{curtarolo:art65}, and\nthe absence of an underlying lattice on which to build configurational thermodynamics \\cite{deFontaine_ssp_1994,curtarolo:art49}\nmake the problem impervious to direct computational analysis.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{fig1.pdf}} \n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\caption{\\small \n  Conceptual illustration of the proposed idea. \n  If a particular alloy composition exhibits many structurally different stable and metastable crystal phases which have similar energies, these phases will compete against each other during solidification, disrupting and frustrating the nucleation and crystallization processes and ultimately leading to an amorphous structure.} \n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[hbt]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.80\\textwidth]{fig2.pdf}} \n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\caption{\\small \n  Schematic of the adopted approach. \n  Multiple different structures for a given stoichiometry are built using the {\\sf AFLOW} prototype libraries \\cite{curtarolo:art65}, which are then optimized via VASP calculations adopting the {\\sf AFLOW} standard settings \\cite{curtarolo:art104}. \n  The resulting data is added to the open thermodynamic database {\\sf AFLOWLIB} \\cite{curtarolo:art92,aflowlibPAPER}. \n  This data is accessed and used to obtain statistics on the cumulative distribution of entries ($N_P$), Bravais lattices types ($N_{BL}$) and space groups ($N_{SG}$) within a given formation enthalpy range (starting at zero). \n  Contour map plots are created from these distributions, allowing the identification of the best glass forming alloys.
