We apply this method to characterize\n an Ag/Si interface relevant for\nphotovoltaic applications and study the rectifying-to-Ohmic transition as function of the semiconductor doping. We also demonstrate that the standard\n``Activation Energy\" method for the analysis of $I$-$V_{bias}$ data\nmight be inaccurate for non-ideal interfaces as it neglects\nelectron tunneling, and that finite-size atomistic models have problems in\ndescribing these interfaces in the presence of doping, due to a poor\nrepresentation of space-charge effects. Conversely, the present method\ndeals effectively with both issues, thus representing a valid\nalternative to conventional procedures for the accurate\ncharacterization of metal-semiconductor interfaces.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\pacs{72.10.-d, 73.30.+y, 73.40.-c,71.15.Mb}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:Introduction}Introduction}\n\nMetal-semiconductor (M-S) contacts play a pivotal role in almost any\nsemiconductor-based technology. They are an integral part of a broad range of devices with application as diverse as photovoltaics (PV) \\cite{Saga2010}, transistors and diodes \\citep{Sze,Kroemer2001}, and fuel-cells \\cite{Carrette2001,Fu2015}.\n\nThe requirement of M-S interfaces with tailored characteristics, such as a specific resistance at the contact, has fueled research on the topic for decades \\cite{Brillson1982,Tung2001}. Nevertheless, despite the high degree of sophistication of current semiconductor technology, the understanding of M-S interfaces at the microscopic level still constitutes a considerable challenge \\cite{Ratner2008,Tung2014}. Even the structure of the interface itself, which is buried in the macroscopic bulk metal and semiconductor materials, represent a serious impediment, as it makes the direct exploration of the interface properties cumbersome.\n\nA measure of the device current $I$ as a function of the applied bias $V_{bias}$ is a standard procedure to probe a M-S interface  \\citep{Sze}, despite the drawback that the measured $I$-$V_{bias}$ curves do not provide any direct information on the interface itself, but rather on the full device characteristics. As such, it is common practice to interpret the $I$-$V_{bias}$ curves by fitting the data with analytical models, which are then used to extract the relevant interface parameters such as the Schottky barrier height $\\Phi$  \\cite{Schroder}.\nAs no general analytical model exists, the accuracy of this procedure critically depends on whether the model describes well the physical regime of the interface under scrutiny. Furthermore, most models disregard the atomistic aspect of the interface, although it is nowadays accepted that chemistry plays a dominant role in determining the electronic characteristics of the interface \\cite{Tung1984,Schmitsdor1995,Tung2000,Tung2001,Tung2014}. These ambiguities complicate the assignment of the features observed in the measured spectra to specific characteristics of the M-S interface.\n\nConversely, atomistic electronic structure methods \\cite{Martin} are an ideal tool for the characterization of M-S interfaces, and have been successfully employed over the years for their analysis \\cite{Das1989,vanSchilfgaarde1990,Picozzi2000,Hoekstra1998,Tanaka2001,Ruini1997,Delaney2010,Hepplestone2014}. However, due to their computational cost, these studies have focussed on model interfaces described using finite-size models formed by few atomic layers  ({\\em e.g.}, slabs), the validity of which is justified in terms of the local nature of the electronic perturbation due to the interface. For similar reasons, most studies have considered non-doped interfaces, as the models required to describe  a statistically meaningful distribution of dopants in the semiconductor would be excessively demanding \\cite{Butler2012,Jiao2015}. Last but not least, these model calculations only describe the system at equilibrium ({\\em i.e.}, at $V_{bias}$ = 0 V), thereby missing a direct connection with the $I$-$V_ {bias}$ measurements.\n\nHere, we develop a general framework which attempts to overcome the limitations inherent in conventional electronic structure methods for simulating M-S interfaces. We employ density functional theory (DFT) \\cite{Payne1992} together with the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method \\cite{Brandbyge2002} to describe the infinite, non-periodic interface exactly. The DFT+NEGF scheme allows us to predict the  behavior of the M-S interface under working conditions by simulating the $I$-$V_{bias}$ characteristics of the interface at zero and at finite $V_{bias}$. To describe correctly the electronic structure of the doped semiconductor, we employ an exchange-correlation (xc) functional designed  {\\em ad-hoc} to reproduce the experimental semiconductor band gap \\cite{Tran2009}, and a novel spatially dependent effective scheme to account for the doping on the semiconductor side.\n\nWe apply this novel DFT+NEGF approach to study the characteristics of a Ag/Si interface relevant for PV applications  \\cite{Kim1998,Weitering1993,Schmitsdor1995,Ballif2003,Li2009,Horteis2010,Garramone2010,\nHilali2005,Pysch2009,Li2010,Butler2011,Butler2012,Balsano2013}. Specifically, we focus on the (100)/(100) interface \\cite{Kim1998,Butler2011} and on the dependence of $I$-$V_{bias}$ characteristics on the semiconductor doping -- notice that the method is completely general and can be used to describe other M-S interfaces with different crystalline orientations. We consider a range of doping densities for which the interface changes from rectifying to Ohmic. We demonstrate that the ``Activation Energy\" (AE) method routinely employed to analyse M-S contacts systematically overestimate the value of $\\Phi$, with an error that is both bias and doping dependent, due to the assumption of a purely thermionic transport mechanism across the barrier. Conversely, we show how an analysis of the $I$-$V_{bias}$ characteristics based on the DFT+NEGF electronic structure data provides a coherent picture of the rectifying-to-Ohmic transition as the doping is varied. Finally, we also show that a slab model does not provide a good representation of the interface electronic structure  when doping in the semiconductor is taken into account. This is due to the inability of the semiconductor side of the slab to screen the electric field resulting from the formation of the interface.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section \\ref{sec:Computational\n  methods} and Section \\ref{sec:System} describe the computational methods and the system models\nemployed in this work, respectively. Section \\ref{sec:Device characteristics and\n  validation of the activation energy model} presents the calculated\n$I$-$V_{bias}$ characteristics and the validation of the AE method\nbased on the calculated data. Section \\ref{sec:Electronic properties\n  of the interface} deals with the analysis of the $I$-$V_{bias}$\ncurves in terms of the electronic structure of the interface as\nobtained from the DFT+NEGF calculations. In Section\n\\ref{sec:Comparison of the two-probe with the slab model}, the\nsimulations are compared to finite-size slab models. The main conclusions are drawn in Section \\ref{sec:Conclusions}.\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:Computational methods}Computational methods}\n\nThe Ag(100)/Si(100) interface has been simulated using Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT as implemented in  \\textsc{atomistix toolkit} \\cite{ATK} (ATK). DFT \\cite{Payne1992} and DFT+NEGF \\cite{Brandbyge2002} simulations have been performed using a formalism based on a non-orthogonal pseudo-atomic orbitals \\cite{Soler2002} (PAOs) basis set.\n\nThe one-electron KS valence orbitals are expanded using a linear\ncombination of double-$\\zeta$ PAOs including polarization functions\n(DZP). The confinement radii $r_c$ employed are 4.39 Bohr,  7.16 Bohr,\n7.16 Bohr for the Ag 4$d$, 5$s$ and 5$p$ orbitals, and 5.40 Bohr,\n6.83 Bohr, 6.83 Bohr for the Si 3$s$, 3$p$, 3$d$ orbitals, respectively. The ionic cores have been described using Troullier-Martins \\cite{Troullier1991} norm-conserving pseudo-potentials \\cite{Hamann1979}. The energy cutoff for the real-space grid used to evaluate the Hartree and xc contributions of the KS Hamiltonian has been set to 150 Ry. Monkhorst-Pack \\cite{Monkhorst1976} grids of {\\em k}-points have been used to sample the 3D (2D) Brillouin zone in the DFT (DFT+NEGF) simulations. We have used an $\\mathrm{11\\times11\\times11}$ grid of {\\em k}-points for the bulk calculations, and a {\\em k}-points grid of $\\mathrm{18\\times9\\times1}$ ($\\mathrm{18\\times9}$) for the DFT (DFT+NEGF)  simulations of the interface. Geometry optimizations have been performed by setting the convergence threshold for the forces of the moving atoms to 2 $\\times$ 10$^{-2}$ eV/{\\AA}. In all the simulations, periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were used to describe the periodic structure extending along the directions parallel to the interface plane. In the slab DFT simulation, Dirichelet and Neumann boundary conditions were applied in the direction normal to the interface on the silver and silicon sides of the simulation cell, respectively, whereas in the DFT+NEGF simulations the same direction was described using Dirichelet boundary conditions at the two boundaries between the interface and the bulk-like electrodes.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:Spill-in terms}``Spill-in\" terms}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{figure1}\n    \\caption{Scheme showing the two-center ``{\\em spill-in}\" terms used for the evaluation of the Hamiltonian (a) and the electronic density (b) of the C region for a pair of $s$ type PAOs $\\phi_j$ and $\\phi_i$ located close to the L/C boundary.

Once the chemical potentials $\\mu_{L,R}$ of the reservoirs have been defined, a self-consistent (SCF) KS procedure is used to obtain the electronic density in the C region.

The reason is that the relevant integrals involved in  Eqs.  \\ref{eq:negf_1}-\\ref{eq:negf_2} are evaluated only in the region of space encompassing the C region, and only for the atoms localized in that region. As a consequence, the tails of the PAOs located close to both sides of the L/C and R/C boundaries, which penetrate into the neighboring regions, are not accounted for (see Fig. \\ref{fig:figure1}). To correct this behavior, we introduce additional corrective terms, that we name ``spill-in\". For the Hamiltonian, corrective terms are applied to both the two-center and three-center integrals.

In fact, a major problem affecting the description of metal-semiconductor interfaces is the severe underestimation of the semiconductor band gap in DFT calculations using (semi-)local xc-functionals based on the local density approximation (LDA) or on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) \\cite{Choen2012}. For model calculations based on few-layer thick fully periodic systems, such an underestimation has been shown to result in unrealistically low Schottky barriers at the interface \\cite{Das1989,Godby1990}. In order to remedy this drawback, we have  evaluated the electronic structure of the LDA-optimized interface geometries using the Tran-Blaha meta-GGA xc-functional (TB09) \\cite{Tran2009}. The TB09 xc-functional has been shown to provide band gaps in excellent agreement with the experiments for a wide range of semiconductors including silicon, at a computational cost comparable to that of conventional (semi-)local functionals. In the TB09 xc-functional, the exchange potential $\\upsilon^\\mathrm{TB09}_x(\\mathbf{r})$ depends explicitly on electron kinetic energy $\\tau(\\mathbf{r})$,\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15022, "prevtext": "\n\n\\noindent with $\\bar{S}^{CC}$ and $\\bar{H}^{CC}$ being the overlap and Hamiltonian matrices associated with the PAOs centered at the C region, and $\\bar{\\Sigma}^{RR}$ being the self-energy matrix of the R reservoir.\n\nHowever, even if the DFT+NEGF method provides an elegant scheme to evaluate $\\bar{D}^{CC}$, it should be noticed that solving Eqs. \\ref{eq:negf_1}-\\ref{eq:negf_2} is not sufficient to obtain the correct Hamiltonian and the electronic density of the C region.

In fact, a major problem affecting the description of metal-semiconductor interfaces is the severe underestimation of the semiconductor band gap in DFT calculations using (semi-)local xc-functionals based on the local density approximation (LDA) or on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) \\cite{Choen2012}. For model calculations based on few-layer thick fully periodic systems, such an underestimation has been shown to result in unrealistically low Schottky barriers at the interface \\cite{Das1989,Godby1990}. In order to remedy this drawback, we have  evaluated the electronic structure of the LDA-optimized interface geometries using the Tran-Blaha meta-GGA xc-functional (TB09) \\cite{Tran2009}. The TB09 xc-functional has been shown to provide band gaps in excellent agreement with the experiments for a wide range of semiconductors including silicon, at a computational cost comparable to that of conventional (semi-)local functionals.

As each atomic density $\\rho_{I}(\\mathbf{r})$ is a constant term, it can be  augmented with a localized ``compensation\" charge having the opposite sign of the desired doping density, which acts as a carrier attractor by modifying the electrostatic potential on the atom. Using these ``compensation\" charges, an effective doping can be achieved both in the DFT and in the DFT+NEGF simulations. In the former, the ``compensation\" charge added to each silicon atom is neutralized by explicitly adding a valence charge of the opposite sign, so that the system remains charge neutral. In the latter, the ``compensation\" charge is neutralized implicitly by the carriers provided by the reservoirs, and the system is maintained charge neutral under the condition that the intrinsic electric field in the system is zero. This effective doping scheme has the advantage of (i) not depending on the precise atomistic details of the doping impurities, and (ii) being completely independent on the size and exact geometry of the system.\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:System}System}\n\nIn order to obtain a reliable description of the Ag(100)/Si(100) interface, we have followed a stepwise procedure. Initially, we have carried out a preliminary screening of the interface geometries and bonding configurations by using a 2$\\times$1 slab model formed by a 6-layers Ag(100) slab interfaced with a 9-layers unreconstructed Si(100) slab. The calculated bulk lattice constants of silicon ($a_\\mathrm{Si}$ = 5.41 \\AA) and silver ($a_\\mathrm{Ag}$ = 4.15\\AA) are in good agreement with those reported in the literature \\cite{Butler2012}. To match the Ag(100) and the Si(100) surface, we have applied an isotropic compressive strain $\\epsilon_{xx}$ = $\\epsilon_{yy}$ = --0.793 along the surface lattice vectors $\\mathbf{v}_{1,2}$ of the Ag(100) surface. We have checked that in the compressed Ag(100) structure, the dispersion of the $s$-band and its position with respect to the $d$-band are very similar to those calculated using the equilibrium value of $a_\\mathrm{Ag}$. The Si(100) surface opposite to the interface has been passivated with hydrogen atoms. The geometry of the resulting 15-layers slab has then been optimized using the LDA by keeping the farthest (with respect to the interface plane) 4 layers of the Ag(100) surface frozen, and by allowing the farthest (with respect to the interface plane) 4 layers of the Si(100) slab to move as a rigid body, thereby freezing only the interatomic distances and angles. All the remaining atoms have been allowed to fully relax. Different starting guesses for the interface structure have been tested, corresponding to different configurations of the Si(100) dangling bonds with respect to the high symmetry {\\em fcc} sites of the Ag(100) surface. The lowest energy configuration among those considered, corresponding to the Si(100) dangling bonds sitting above the ``hollow\" {\\em fcc} sites of the Ag(100) surface, has then been used as a representative model of the interface.\n\nStarting from the lowest energy configuration obtained using the\n15-layers slab, we have then constructed more realistic models of the\ninterface. Specifically, we have expanded the bulk regions of the\n15-layer slab to create two-probe setups effectively describing the\ninfinite, non-periodic interface (Fig. \\ref{fig:figure3}a). A final\ngeometry optimization has been carried out using a two-probe setup in\nwhich the C region has been described by 8 Ag(100) layers and an\nundoped silicon layer having a total width $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ =\n47.84 \\AA. The optimized geometry has been used to construct two-probe\nsetups in which the doping of the silicon side has been taken into\naccount using the effective doping method described in Section\n\\ref{sec:Semiconductor doping}. We have considered doping densities of\n    {\\em n}-type carriers ($n_\\mathrm{d}$) in the experimentally\n    relevant range [10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ -- 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$]. As\n    discussed in more detail in Section \\ref{sec:Results}, the width\n    of the Si(100) layer needed to describe accurately the interface\n    in the two-probe simulations depends on the size of the\n    depletion region ($W_\\mathrm{D}$) on the silicon side of the\n    interface. The relation between $W_\\mathrm{D}$ and $n_\\mathrm{d}$\n    is 1/$W_\\mathrm{D}$ $\\propto$  n$_\\mathrm{d}^{1/2}$, so that\n    progressively narrower C regions can be used as the doping level is increased without any loss in accuracy. Therefore, in the following, the results presented for $n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, $n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ refer to calculations performed with C regions of widths $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ = 47.84 \\AA, $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ = 197.436 \\AA\\ and $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ = 447.92 \\AA, respectively. We have checked that reducing the width of the C region does not have any effect on the results, as long as all the space-charge effects due to the presence of the interface take place within the screening region. Furthermore, we notice how using a two-probe setup also allows to simulate the characteristics of the interface when the L and R reservoirs are set at two different chemical potentials $\\mu_L \\neq \\mu_R$ due to an applied bias voltage $qV_{bias} = \\mu_R - \\mu_L$. As will become clear later, this allows for a direct comparison to experiments and for  analyzing the electronic structure of the interface under working conditions.\n\nFinally, to understand to which extent the slab model is able to describe accurately the electronic structure of the infinite, non-periodic interface, we have also considered slab models having a similar interface geometry as that used in the two probe setup (Fig. \\ref{fig:figure3}b). Both short (S) and long (L) slab models have been constructed, in which the width of the Si(100) layer used to describe the silicon side of the interface has been set to either $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{slab(S)}$ = 38.33 \\AA\\, or $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{slab(L)}$ = 98.62 \\AA. Notice how these values of $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{slab}$ are many times larger than those used for similar studies of the Ag(100)/Si(100) interface reported in the literature \\cite{Butler2011}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{figure5}\n    \\caption{Calculated $I$-$V_\\mathrm{bias}$ (a) and forward bias $I/(1-e^{q|V_{bias}|/k_BT})$-$V_{bias}$ (b) characteristics at $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ (blue triangles), $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ (green squares), $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ (red dots).

A strong dependence on the doping concentration is evident. At low doping, the interface shows a well-defined Schottky diode-like behavior: the forward bias ($V_{bias}$ $>$ 0 V) current increases about six orders of magnitude in the range of $V_{bias}$ [0.02 V -- 0.5 V], whereas the reverse bias one (V$_\\mathrm{bias}$ $<$ 0 V) varies only within one order of magnitude in the corresponding range. The diode-like asymmetry in the $I$-$V_{bias}$ curves persists at intermediate doping, although it is less pronounced than at low doping; the current at forward bias and reverse bias varying within three and two orders of magnitude, respectively. The scenario changes qualitatively at high doping as the $I$-$V_{bias}$ curve becomes highly symmetric, suggesting an Ohmic behavior of the interface.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{figure6}\n    \\caption{(a,b) Empty dots: calculated $I$-$T$ data at different bias voltages for $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ (a) and $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ (b).

Using these ``compensation\" charges, an effective doping can be achieved both in the DFT and in the DFT+NEGF simulations. In the former, the ``compensation\" charge added to each silicon atom is neutralized by explicitly adding a valence charge of the opposite sign, so that the system remains charge neutral. In the latter, the ``compensation\" charge is neutralized implicitly by the carriers provided by the reservoirs, and the system is maintained charge neutral under the condition that the intrinsic electric field in the system is zero. This effective doping scheme has the advantage of (i) not depending on the precise atomistic details of the doping impurities, and (ii) being completely independent on the size and exact geometry of the system.\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:System}System}\n\nIn order to obtain a reliable description of the Ag(100)/Si(100) interface, we have followed a stepwise procedure. Initially, we have carried out a preliminary screening of the interface geometries and bonding configurations by using a 2$\\times$1 slab model formed by a 6-layers Ag(100) slab interfaced with a 9-layers unreconstructed Si(100) slab. The calculated bulk lattice constants of silicon ($a_\\mathrm{Si}$ = 5.41 \\AA) and silver ($a_\\mathrm{Ag}$ = 4.15\\AA) are in good agreement with those reported in the literature \\cite{Butler2012}. To match the Ag(100) and the Si(100) surface, we have applied an isotropic compressive strain $\\epsilon_{xx}$ = $\\epsilon_{yy}$ = --0.793 along the surface lattice vectors $\\mathbf{v}_{1,2}$ of the Ag(100) surface. We have checked that in the compressed Ag(100) structure, the dispersion of the $s$-band and its position with respect to the $d$-band are very similar to those calculated using the equilibrium value of $a_\\mathrm{Ag}$. The Si(100) surface opposite to the interface has been passivated with hydrogen atoms. The geometry of the resulting 15-layers slab has then been optimized using the LDA by keeping the farthest (with respect to the interface plane) 4 layers of the Ag(100) surface frozen, and by allowing the farthest (with respect to the interface plane) 4 layers of the Si(100) slab to move as a rigid body, thereby freezing only the interatomic distances and angles. All the remaining atoms have been allowed to fully relax. Different starting guesses for the interface structure have been tested, corresponding to different configurations of the Si(100) dangling bonds with respect to the high symmetry {\\em fcc} sites of the Ag(100) surface. The lowest energy configuration among those considered, corresponding to the Si(100) dangling bonds sitting above the ``hollow\" {\\em fcc} sites of the Ag(100) surface, has then been used as a representative model of the interface.\n\nStarting from the lowest energy configuration obtained using the\n15-layers slab, we have then constructed more realistic models of the\ninterface. Specifically, we have expanded the bulk regions of the\n15-layer slab to create two-probe setups effectively describing the\ninfinite, non-periodic interface (Fig. \\ref{fig:figure3}a). A final\ngeometry optimization has been carried out using a two-probe setup in\nwhich the C region has been described by 8 Ag(100) layers and an\nundoped silicon layer having a total width $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ =\n47.84 \\AA. The optimized geometry has been used to construct two-probe\nsetups in which the doping of the silicon side has been taken into\naccount using the effective doping method described in Section\n\\ref{sec:Semiconductor doping}. We have considered doping densities of\n    {\\em n}-type carriers ($n_\\mathrm{d}$) in the experimentally\n    relevant range [10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ -- 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$]. As\n    discussed in more detail in Section \\ref{sec:Results}, the width\n    of the Si(100) layer needed to describe accurately the interface\n    in the two-probe simulations depends on the size of the\n    depletion region ($W_\\mathrm{D}$) on the silicon side of the\n    interface. The relation between $W_\\mathrm{D}$ and $n_\\mathrm{d}$\n    is 1/$W_\\mathrm{D}$ $\\propto$  n$_\\mathrm{d}^{1/2}$, so that\n    progressively narrower C regions can be used as the doping level is increased without any loss in accuracy. Therefore, in the following, the results presented for $n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, $n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ refer to calculations performed with C regions of widths $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ = 47.84 \\AA, $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ = 197.436 \\AA\\ and $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{CC}$ = 447.92 \\AA, respectively. We have checked that reducing the width of the C region does not have any effect on the results, as long as all the space-charge effects due to the presence of the interface take place within the screening region. Furthermore, we notice how using a two-probe setup also allows to simulate the characteristics of the interface when the L and R reservoirs are set at two different chemical potentials $\\mu_L \\neq \\mu_R$ due to an applied bias voltage $qV_{bias} = \\mu_R - \\mu_L$. As will become clear later, this allows for a direct comparison to experiments and for  analyzing the electronic structure of the interface under working conditions.\n\nFinally, to understand to which extent the slab model is able to describe accurately the electronic structure of the infinite, non-periodic interface, we have also considered slab models having a similar interface geometry as that used in the two probe setup (Fig. \\ref{fig:figure3}b). Both short (S) and long (L) slab models have been constructed, in which the width of the Si(100) layer used to describe the silicon side of the interface has been set to either $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{slab(S)}$ = 38.33 \\AA\\, or $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{slab(L)}$ = 98.62 \\AA. Notice how these values of $W_\\mathrm{Si(100)}^\\mathrm{slab}$ are many times larger than those used for similar studies of the Ag(100)/Si(100) interface reported in the literature \\cite{Butler2011}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{figure5}\n    \\caption{Calculated $I$-$V_\\mathrm{bias}$ (a) and forward bias $I/(1-e^{q|V_{bias}|/k_BT})$-$V_{bias}$ (b) characteristics at $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ (blue triangles), $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ (green squares), $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ (red dots).

A strong dependence on the doping concentration is evident. At low doping, the interface shows a well-defined Schottky diode-like behavior: the forward bias ($V_{bias}$ $>$ 0 V) current increases about six orders of magnitude in the range of $V_{bias}$ [0.02 V -- 0.5 V], whereas the reverse bias one (V$_\\mathrm{bias}$ $<$ 0 V) varies only within one order of magnitude in the corresponding range. The diode-like asymmetry in the $I$-$V_{bias}$ curves persists at intermediate doping, although it is less pronounced than at low doping; the current at forward bias and reverse bias varying within three and two orders of magnitude, respectively. The scenario changes qualitatively at high doping as the $I$-$V_{bias}$ curve becomes highly symmetric, suggesting an Ohmic behavior of the interface.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\textwidth]{figure6}\n    \\caption{(a,b) Empty dots: calculated $I$-$T$ data at different bias voltages for $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ (a) and $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ (b).

Fully self-consistent simulations performed for selected temperatures show that this approach is valid within the range of $T$ considered, 250 K $\\leq T \\leq$ 400 K.\n\nIdeally, for a given doping the Schottky barrier depends exclusively\non the M-S energy level alignment at the interface and\ntherefore, disregarding image-force lowering effects, should remain\nconstant with $V_{bias}$ \\citep{Sze}. This implies that in\nEq. \\ref{eq:thermionic_3}, the left-hand side should equal the\nright-hand side at any value of $V_{bias}$. However, in the present\ncase this condition is not verified, as the variation of the\nright-hand side term with $V_{bias}$ is larger than that of the\nleft-hand side term (see Fig. \\ref{fig:figure6}c,d). Indeed, for\n$n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ ($n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{19}$\ncm$^{-3}$), a linear fit to the calculated values of the left-hand\nside of Eq. \\ref{eq:thermionic_3} gives a slope of --664 meV/V (--177\nmeV/V), whereas the slope associated to the variation of the\nright-hand side term is --917 meV/V (--549 meV/V).\n\nFollowing the procedure in the AE method we use the\nvalue of $n$ obtained from Fig.~\\ref{fig:figure5} to subtract the\nbias dependence. The result is shown in Fig.\n\\ref{fig:figure6}e,f and it can be seen that this leads to an\nunphysical increase of $\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ with $V_{bias}$. The error becomes more severe as $n_\\mathrm{d}$\nis increased. At low (intermediate) doping, $\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ varies\nfrom by 30$\\%$ (325$\\%$) in the range of V$_{bias}$ considered,\nleading to a change $\\Delta\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ = 3.73 $k_B T$\n($\\Delta\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ = 7.31 $k_B T$). Thus, the intrinsic\naccuracy of the AE method depends strongly on multiple factors. On the\none side, the non-linear increase in $\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ with\n$V_{bias}$ suggests that using a single value of $V_{bias}$ is not\nsufficient to obtain an accurate estimate of $\\Phi$. On the other\nside, the change in $\\Delta\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ with $n_\\mathrm{d}$ at a\ngiven $V_{bias}$ indicates that the AE method is unsuited for\ncomparative analyses of the variation of $\\Phi$ with doping. These\nfacts call for a more direct and general strategy for the\ncharacterization of M-S interfaces under working\nconditions.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:Electronic properties of the interface}Electronic properties of the interface}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figure7}\n    \\caption{(a) Scheme of the electronic structure of the Ag/Si interface at forward bias voltage.

However, in the present case $I(E)$ is finite also at $E-\\mu_L < \\Phi^\\mathrm{pot}$,  indicating that electron tunneling has a non-negligible contribution to $I$.

In agreement with the previous analyses, this deviation is considerably larger in the intermediate doping case, due to the much larger contribution of electron tunneling.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:Comparison of the two-probe with the slab model}Comparison of the two-probe with the slab model}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{figure8}\n    \\caption{Profile of $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ along the direction Z normal to the interface plane, calculated for the two-probe setup (blue solid line) and for the S (green dotted line) and L (red dashed line) slab models, at doping densities $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ (a), $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ (b) and $n_\\mathrm{d}$ = 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ (c).

Such models are integral parts of the\nband alignment method often used to evaluate $\\Phi$\nusing conventional DFT\n\\cite{VandeWalle1987,VandeWalle1989,Fraciosi1996,Peressi1998}. The\nmethod relies on aligning the electronic band structures of the two\nbulk materials forming the interface on an absolute energy scale by\nusing a reference quantity, often $\\langle V_H \\rangle$\n\\cite{Baldereschi1988}. The perturbation of the bulk electronic\nstructure in each materials due to the presence of the interface is\naccounted for by either a slab \\cite{Butler2011} or a fully periodic\n\\cite{Niranjan2006} model. $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ is then used as a common reference to align the electronic structure obtained from independent calculations of the two bulk materials. Despite its widespread use, this strategy relies on two drastic assumptions. Firstly, it is implicitly assumed that the electronic properties of the interface are independent on the doping level of the semiconductor. Moreover, it is assumed that the electronic properties in the central part of each side of the interface model are a good approximation to those of the two bulk materials.\n\nFig. \\ref{fig:figure8} shows a comparison between  $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ obtained at the different doping densities considered for the two slab models (S and L, see Section \\ref{sec:System}) and for the two-probe setup. We notice that introducing an effective doping in the slab model, which was not taken into account in previous slab models for Ag/Si interfaces \\cite{Butler2011}, attempts to better mimic the two-probe simulation in which silver is interfaced with n-doped silicon. The profiles of $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ of the three different systems have been aligned according to the value of $\\mu_L$, the side at which Dirichlet boundary conditions are used for the three systems. Irrespectively on the doping level, the doped S slab model provides a poor description of the variation of $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ at the interface. In particular, $\\langle V_H^\\mathrm{max} \\rangle$ is always $\\sim$200 meV higher that that obtained for the two-probe model. Furthermore, on the Si(100) side of the interface, $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ does not decay correctly with the distance from the interface for model S and, even more importantly, it does never converge to a constant value. The situation improves by increasing the width of the Si(100) layer. For the L model, at increasingly larger doping densities the profile of  $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ resembles more and more that of the two-probe model. Indeed, in the best case scenario, \\emph{i.e.}, at $n_\\mathrm{d} = $10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the profile of $\\langle V_H \\rangle$ evaluated using the L slab becomes constant in the center of the Si(100) region, albeit it is still higher than that of the reference by $\\sim$100 meV. The limitations of the slab model in reproducing the electronic structure at the interface are also evident by looking at the corresponding LDOS plots (see Fig. \\ref{fig:figure9}). Similarly to what is observed for $\\langle V_H \\rangle$, the S slab model fails to reproduce the band bending observed at low doping, as well as the correct trend in the decrease of W$_\\mathrm{D}$ as doping is increased. The latter is qualitatively reproduced using the L slab model. However, these modest improvements going from the S to the L slab model come at the expenses of a much higher computational cost. In fact, each DFT calculation for the L slab model takes on average 338.6 s/step. Conversely, each DFT+NEGF calculation using the two-probe model is approximatively one order of magnitude faster, taking on average 46.6 s/step. This suggests that, in addition to computational efficiency, there are also more fundamental reasons for making DFT+NEGF the method of choice for describing  M-S interfaces, as in the two-probe setup the two main assumptions of the band alignment method are naturally lifted. We emphasize that, although the results presented in this paper are specific to the Ag(100)/Si(100) interface only, similar conclusions are likely to hold true for all systems for which the poor screening on the semiconductor side of the interface results in space--charge effects that extend over widths of the order of several nanometers.\n\n\\section{\\label{sec:Conclusions} Conclusions}\n\nIn this work, we have presented an approach based on density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) for realistic metal-semiconductor (M-S) interfaces modeling. Our  approach is designed to deal effectively and correctly with the non-periodic nature of the interface, with the semiconductor band gap and with the doping on the semiconductor side of the contact, and allows for a direct theory-experiment comparison  as it can simulate $I$-$V_{bias}$ characteristics. Using a Ag/Si interface relevant for photovoltaic applications as a model system, we have shown that our approach is a better alternative to (i) analytical approaches such as the ``Activation Energy\" (AE) method to analyze the $I$-$V_{bias}$ characteristics of non-ideal rectifying system with non-negligible tunneling contribution, and (ii) finite-size slab models to describe the interface between metals and doped semiconductors. This DFT+NEGF approach could pave the way for a novel understanding of M-S interfaces beyond the limitations imposed by traditional analytical and atomistic methods.\n\n\\bibliography{biblio}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 43367, "prevtext": "\n\n\\noindent in which $n$ is the ideality factor extracted above.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{figure4}\n    \\caption{Local density of states (LDOS) of the two-probe setup at equilibrium for $n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ (a), $n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ (b) and $n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ (c).

The $I$-$T$ dependence has been evaluated in a linear response fashion, using the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker expression for the current, $I = \\frac{2q}{h}\\int T(E,\\mu_L,\\mu_R) [f(\\frac{E-\\mu_L}{k_B T}) - f(\\frac{E-\\mu_R}{k_B T})] dE$ with the transmission coefficient $T(E,\\mu_L,\\mu_R)$ evaluated self-consistently at an electron temperature of 300 K. Fully self-consistent simulations performed for selected temperatures show that this approach is valid within the range of $T$ considered, 250 K $\\leq T \\leq$ 400 K.\n\nIdeally, for a given doping the Schottky barrier depends exclusively\non the M-S energy level alignment at the interface and\ntherefore, disregarding image-force lowering effects, should remain\nconstant with $V_{bias}$ \\citep{Sze}. This implies that in\nEq. \\ref{eq:thermionic_3}, the left-hand side should equal the\nright-hand side at any value of $V_{bias}$. However, in the present\ncase this condition is not verified, as the variation of the\nright-hand side term with $V_{bias}$ is larger than that of the\nleft-hand side term (see Fig. \\ref{fig:figure6}c,d). Indeed, for\n$n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ ($n_\\mathrm{d}$ =  10$^{19}$\ncm$^{-3}$), a linear fit to the calculated values of the left-hand\nside of Eq. \\ref{eq:thermionic_3} gives a slope of --664 meV/V (--177\nmeV/V), whereas the slope associated to the variation of the\nright-hand side term is --917 meV/V (--549 meV/V).\n\nFollowing the procedure in the AE method we use the\nvalue of $n$ obtained from Fig.~\\ref{fig:figure5} to subtract the\nbias dependence. The result is shown in Fig.\n\\ref{fig:figure6}e,f and it can be seen that this leads to an\nunphysical increase of $\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ with $V_{bias}$. The error becomes more severe as $n_\\mathrm{d}$\nis increased. At low (intermediate) doping, $\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ varies\nfrom by 30$\\%$ (325$\\%$) in the range of V$_{bias}$ considered,\nleading to a change $\\Delta\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ = 3.73 $k_B T$\n($\\Delta\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ = 7.31 $k_B T$). Thus, the intrinsic\naccuracy of the AE method depends strongly on multiple factors. On the\none side, the non-linear increase in $\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ with\n$V_{bias}$ suggests that using a single value of $V_{bias}$ is not\nsufficient to obtain an accurate estimate of $\\Phi$. On the other\nside, the change in $\\Delta\\Phi^\\mathrm{AE}$ with $n_\\mathrm{d}$ at a\ngiven $V_{bias}$ indicates that the AE method is unsuited for\ncomparative analyses of the variation of $\\Phi$ with doping. These\nfacts call for a more direct and general strategy for the\ncharacterization of M-S interfaces under working\nconditions.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:Electronic properties of the interface}Electronic properties of the interface}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{figure7}\n    \\caption{(a) Scheme of the electronic structure of the Ag/Si interface at forward bias voltage.
