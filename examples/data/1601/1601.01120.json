For the case of longitudinal inhomogeneity of disorder we find that the statistics of the transmission channels is independent of the inhomogeneity and the system can be equivalent to a counterpart with homogeneous disorder strength, both of which have the same statistical distribution of the transmission channels. However, for the case of transverse inhomogeneity of disorder, such equivalence does not exist, moreover, the transmission eigenvalues are pushed to the two ends of the distribution and the distribution of the total transmission is broadened since the spatial structure gives rise to larger and smaller transmitted incident channels.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nCoherent transport of waves in random media at the the mesoscopic scale showing extraordinary characteristics has attracted much attention in recent decades. Wave interference during the multiple scattering leads to many amazing physical phenomena, such as Anderson localization, enhanced backscattering and universal conductance fluctuations\\cite{Anderson1958,Albada1985,Wolf1985,Lee1985,Scheffold1998}. In the theoretical framework of quantum transport, an incident wave (outgoing wave) can be decomposed into several transport channels, which correspond to the quantized directions in which the wave enters (exits) the random medium. \n\nThe transmission behaviour of the channels is governed by the $N \\times N$ field transmission matrix $t$, where $N$ is the number of the channels. With $t$ one can obtain the transmitted intensity, the total transmission for different incident channels as well as the transmittance. From the statistics of these quantities one can extract rich information about the transmitted wave\\cite{Rossum1999}. Eigenvalues $\\{\\tau_{n}\\}$ of the Hermitian matrix $t^{\\dagger}t$ together with the corresponding eigenchannels can also be extracted from $t$\\cite{Dorokhov1982,Dorokhov1984,Mello1988}, and researches on the so-called ``open channels'' with $\\tau_{n} \\simeq 1$ has realized focusing and imaging of light through turbid media\\cite{Vellekoop2007,Vellekoop2008,Popoff2010,Choi2012,Kim2012,Kim2013}. \n\nThe transmission matrix $t$ is determined by the configuration of disorder when the dimensions of the sample are fixed, and previous researches mostly focused on homogeneous disorder. However, inhomogeneous disorder exists widely in natural and artificial materials. The inhomogeneity may results from multilayer configurations or inhomogeneous doping, which are common in real experiments and can not be eliminated by ensemble averaging. \n\nThe additional degree of freedom introduced by the inhomogeneity of disorder will cause difficulties for theoretical investigations on transport properties and the behaviour of channels in such random media. Thus two fundamental questions are proposed. The first question is that, is there any equivalent treating method, which is analogous to the effective medium theory, and can be applied to deal with the inhomogeneity? And the subsequent question is that, if there is no such method, then how can we consider the influence of such inhomogeneity? \n\nIn this work, we investigate the influence of inhomogeneous disorder by numerical simulations and try to provide basic comprehension for the questions proposed above. \n\n\\section{Methods and Configurations}\nTo study the light transport properties and the behaviour of transmission channels in random media, we consider a 2D disordered waveguide with two semi-infinite free waveguides attached to its both sides.

Moreover, since the reflection probability per unit sample length is equal to the inverse of the mean free path $l$\\cite{Mello1991}, and thus is proportional to $[\\sigma(x)]^{2}$\\cite{xu2015}, then by taking the scattering effect of all length units into account one can obtain Eq. \\eqref{generaldis}, which is actually a reasonable extrapolation of the longitudinally position-dependent mean free path. \n\n\\subsection{Transverse inhomogeneity of disorder}\nWhen the two layers with different disorder strength are arranged along the transverse direction, as shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig:multi}(b), the situation is more complicated and interesting. First it is important to check whether there as well exists any strict equivalence between the cases of homogeneous and inhomogeneous disorder by comparing the respective distributions of the transmission eigenvalue density $\\rho(\\tau)$. \n\nThe random samples size $L$ and $W$ are fixed at $400d$ and $50d$, and the disorder strengths of the upper and lower layer are $\\sigma_{1}=0.5$ and $\\sigma_2=0.05$, respectively. Four samples are under consideration and labelled as $A1-A4$, with the width fraction of the upper layer $f=0.2,0.5,0.7,0.9$ in sequence. \n\nThe calculated conductance $g$ for the four samples are 6.33, 3.25, 1.61 and 0.59, respectively. To verify the above-mentioned equivalence, we calculated   conductance $g$ of a series of random samples with homogeneous disorder strength and same sample sizes, and finally obtained four random samples with identical respective conductance $g$ of $A1-A4$. The disorder strengths for the obtained four samples are approximately $\\sigma=0.152,0.221,0.305,0.454$, respectively, and we labeled these four samples as $B1-B4$. The calculated distributions of transmission eigenvalue density $\\rho(\\tau)$ for samples $A1-A4$ and $B1-B4$ are plotted in circles in Fig. \\ref{Fig:dtel2}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{FIG4.eps}\n\\caption{Distributions of eigenvalue density for samples with transversely inhomogeneous disorder and homogeneous disorder calculated for $f=0.2,0.5,0.7,0.9$ (empty circles, from top to bottom) in the former case and corresponding values of $\\sigma^{2}$ obtained for same $g$'s in the latter case (filled circles, from top to bottom).}\n\\label{Fig:dtel2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSince the solid lines in Fig. \\ref{Fig:dtel2} calculated theoretically using Eq. \\eqref{bimodal} with the corresponding $g$ fit well to the numerical results for homogeneous-disorder samples B1 and B2, therefore light transport in these two samples is in the diffusive regime. However, as a comparison, for the corresponding inhomogeneous-disorder samples A1 and A2, the distributions of eigenvalue density are obviously different from the theoretical values, especially for large and very small (close to 0) eigenvalues. Similar behaviour can be found by comparing $\\rho(\\tau)$ of samples A3 and B3.\n\nHowever, for samples A4 and B4 with the smallest conductance $g$ among these random samples, the difference in $\\rho(\\tau)$ almost disappears. Futher investigation on the total transmission for different incident channel $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ of samples A4 and B4, as shown in Fig.\\ref{Fig:ttt}(d), reveals obviously different transport properties between them.   \n\nAs a result, by the comparison among transmission eigenvalue distributions $\\rho(\\tau)$, it is found that when the width fraction $f$ is non-trivial, even though two random samples with homogeneous and inhomogeneous disorder give identical conductance $g$, the statistics of eigenchannels for them are probably different. Thus it can be concluded that random samples with transverse inhomogeneity of disorder definitely can not be equivalent to those with homogeneous disorder, which implies that the scaling theory is no longer valid under such situation. \n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FIG5.eps}\n\\caption{The ensemble-averaged total transmission $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ of different incident channels for samples with (a) $g=6.33$, (b) $g=3.25$, (c) $g=1.61$ and (d) $g=0.59$. The blue connected circles represent the samples with homogeneous disorder and the connected squares represent the samples with transversely inhomogeneous disorder. }\n\\label{Fig:ttt}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to shed light on the anomalous transport properties of random samples with transversely inhomogeneous disoder, here we consider an extreme case in which the disorder strength of the lower layer equals zero, i.e., the lower layer is scattering free. Light in incident channels with small incident angles may travel through the lower layer without experiencing any scattering, thus the status of different incident channels are totally different. \n\nIn this sense, it is more instructive to study the statistics of the total transmission  $T_{a}$ for different incident channels $a$. The incident channel index $a$ represents the transverse mode of the corresponding incident channel which corresponds to the incident angle $\\theta_{a} = \\cos ^{-1}(k_{a}/k)$ ($k_{a}$ is the longitudinal wave vector). \n\nThe dependence of the averaged total transmission $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ on the channel index $a$ is shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}. Here the average is only taken over different random configurations, and thus $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ represents the ratio of light that transmitted through the scattering region on average for a certain incident angle $\\theta_{a}$. For the case of homogeneous disorder (samples $B1-B4$), $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ hardly depends on the incident channel index $a$ in a wide range ($a\\lesssim 15$ herein), which means that in random samples with homogeneous disorder, the probability of light transport through relatively high transmission channels ($a<15$ or $\\theta<0.22\\pi$ for homegeneous disorder samples $B1-B4$) is nearly equal, regardless of the disorder strength of random samples.\n\nWhile for the case of transversely inhomogeneous disorder samples (i.e. $A1-A4$), $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ considerably depends on the incident channel $a$, which shows a relatively larger variation, and as well as a transmission peak corresponding to the most transmitted incident channel, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}. \n\nWhen the fraction of the weakly scattering layer is large enough, e.g. $f=0.2$ shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}(a), the highest transmission takes place at the incident channel with the smallest incident angle, i.e. $a=1$. When the fraction of the strongly scattering layer $f$ increases, the index of the most transmitted channel increases ($a=2,3,8$ shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}(b-d)), which means that the incident channel with the smallest incident angle is no longer the most transmitted channel, but replaced by another channel with a larger incident angle.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FIG6.eps}\n\\caption{Distributions of normalized total transmission $s_{a}$ for samples with (a) $g=6.33$, (b) $g=3.25$, (c) $g=1.61$ and (d) $g=0.59$.

For the case of an arbitrary conductance $g$, $P(s_{a})$ shows an exponentially decaying tail. When the conductance $g$ is large enough, e.g., $g=6.33$ in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:psa}(a), the shape of the probability $P(s_{a})$ is Gaussian-like in the vicinity of $s_{a} \\sim 1$, and becomes log-normal when $s_{a} \\ll 1$. When $g$ decreases, the transmission peak deviates from $s_{a} \\sim 1$ and locates at some value of $s_{a}<1$, and the Gaussian shape around the peak gradually vanishes. \n\nAs shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:psa}, the distributions of $s_{a}$ of the samples with inhomogeneous disorder are broader than those of the corresponding samples with homogeneous disorder (except for A4 and B4), even though they have the same conductance $g$. This phenomenon means that, when the fraction of the weakly scattering layer is large enough, light incident from different directions to occupy a larger range of transmittance. \n\nFor sample A1 with $f=0.2$, there is another peak of $P(s_{a})$ near $s_{a}=2.75$, which corresponds to the average transmission peak at $a=1$ in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}(a). Similarly, $s_{a}\\simeq 2.75$ in Fig.\\ref{Fig:psa}(b) corresponds to the peak at $a=2$ in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}(b). This means that some of the channels are hardly influenced by the upper layer with strong disorder. When $f$ increases, the extra peak gradually vanishes and the distribution of $s_{a}$ approaches that of the sample with homogeneous disorder. When $f$ is large enough, the effect of inhomogeneity nearly vanishes. \n\nNote that though the influence of the spatial structure is not revealed by considering the distribution of total transmission as shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:psa}(d), it still considerably affects the statistics of the light transmission which has been shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}(d). \n\n\\section{Conclusions}\nWe have carried out a detailed numerical investigation on how the inhomogeneity of disorder influence the light transport properties and the statistics of transmission channels in 2D disordered waveguides. For waveguides with longitudinal inhomogeneity of disorder, transmission channels are not modified and the transport of light can be equivalent to that in waveguides with effective homogeneous disorder. However, for waveguides with transverse inhomogeneity of disorder, the statistics of the transmission channels are considerably modified and the light transport reveals hybrid behaviours of different regimes, which leads to the additional repulsion of large and small transmission eigenvalues and broadening of the distributions of the total transmission. The results in the present paper may promote both the theoretical and experimental investigations on light transport in more extensive disordered materials. \n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 11374063, and 973 Program(No. 2013CAB01505).\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\n\\bibitem{Anderson1958}\nP.~W.

This hypothesis keeps valid as long as the disorder is homogeneous in the transverse direction, despite the inhomogeneity in the longitudinal direction. Moreover, since the reflection probability per unit sample length is equal to the inverse of the mean free path $l$\\cite{Mello1991}, and thus is proportional to $[\\sigma(x)]^{2}$\\cite{xu2015}, then by taking the scattering effect of all length units into account one can obtain Eq. \\eqref{generaldis}, which is actually a reasonable extrapolation of the longitudinally position-dependent mean free path. \n\n\\subsection{Transverse inhomogeneity of disorder}\nWhen the two layers with different disorder strength are arranged along the transverse direction, as shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig:multi}(b), the situation is more complicated and interesting. First it is important to check whether there as well exists any strict equivalence between the cases of homogeneous and inhomogeneous disorder by comparing the respective distributions of the transmission eigenvalue density $\\rho(\\tau)$. \n\nThe random samples size $L$ and $W$ are fixed at $400d$ and $50d$, and the disorder strengths of the upper and lower layer are $\\sigma_{1}=0.5$ and $\\sigma_2=0.05$, respectively. Four samples are under consideration and labelled as $A1-A4$, with the width fraction of the upper layer $f=0.2,0.5,0.7,0.9$ in sequence. \n\nThe calculated conductance $g$ for the four samples are 6.33, 3.25, 1.61 and 0.59, respectively. To verify the above-mentioned equivalence, we calculated   conductance $g$ of a series of random samples with homogeneous disorder strength and same sample sizes, and finally obtained four random samples with identical respective conductance $g$ of $A1-A4$. The disorder strengths for the obtained four samples are approximately $\\sigma=0.152,0.221,0.305,0.454$, respectively, and we labeled these four samples as $B1-B4$. The calculated distributions of transmission eigenvalue density $\\rho(\\tau)$ for samples $A1-A4$ and $B1-B4$ are plotted in circles in Fig. \\ref{Fig:dtel2}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{FIG4.eps}\n\\caption{Distributions of eigenvalue density for samples with transversely inhomogeneous disorder and homogeneous disorder calculated for $f=0.2,0.5,0.7,0.9$ (empty circles, from top to bottom) in the former case and corresponding values of $\\sigma^{2}$ obtained for same $g$'s in the latter case (filled circles, from top to bottom).}\n\\label{Fig:dtel2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSince the solid lines in Fig. \\ref{Fig:dtel2} calculated theoretically using Eq. \\eqref{bimodal} with the corresponding $g$ fit well to the numerical results for homogeneous-disorder samples B1 and B2, therefore light transport in these two samples is in the diffusive regime. However, as a comparison, for the corresponding inhomogeneous-disorder samples A1 and A2, the distributions of eigenvalue density are obviously different from the theoretical values, especially for large and very small (close to 0) eigenvalues. Similar behaviour can be found by comparing $\\rho(\\tau)$ of samples A3 and B3.\n\nHowever, for samples A4 and B4 with the smallest conductance $g$ among these random samples, the difference in $\\rho(\\tau)$ almost disappears. Futher investigation on the total transmission for different incident channel $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ of samples A4 and B4, as shown in Fig.\\ref{Fig:ttt}(d), reveals obviously different transport properties between them.   \n\nAs a result, by the comparison among transmission eigenvalue distributions $\\rho(\\tau)$, it is found that when the width fraction $f$ is non-trivial, even though two random samples with homogeneous and inhomogeneous disorder give identical conductance $g$, the statistics of eigenchannels for them are probably different. Thus it can be concluded that random samples with transverse inhomogeneity of disorder definitely can not be equivalent to those with homogeneous disorder, which implies that the scaling theory is no longer valid under such situation. \n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FIG5.eps}\n\\caption{The ensemble-averaged total transmission $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ of different incident channels for samples with (a) $g=6.33$, (b) $g=3.25$, (c) $g=1.61$ and (d) $g=0.59$. The blue connected circles represent the samples with homogeneous disorder and the connected squares represent the samples with transversely inhomogeneous disorder. }\n\\label{Fig:ttt}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to shed light on the anomalous transport properties of random samples with transversely inhomogeneous disoder, here we consider an extreme case in which the disorder strength of the lower layer equals zero, i.e., the lower layer is scattering free. Light in incident channels with small incident angles may travel through the lower layer without experiencing any scattering, thus the status of different incident channels are totally different. \n\nIn this sense, it is more instructive to study the statistics of the total transmission  $T_{a}$ for different incident channels $a$. The incident channel index $a$ represents the transverse mode of the corresponding incident channel which corresponds to the incident angle $\\theta_{a} = \\cos ^{-1}(k_{a}/k)$ ($k_{a}$ is the longitudinal wave vector). \n\nThe dependence of the averaged total transmission $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ on the channel index $a$ is shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}. Here the average is only taken over different random configurations, and thus $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ represents the ratio of light that transmitted through the scattering region on average for a certain incident angle $\\theta_{a}$. For the case of homogeneous disorder (samples $B1-B4$), $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ hardly depends on the incident channel index $a$ in a wide range ($a\\lesssim 15$ herein), which means that in random samples with homogeneous disorder, the probability of light transport through relatively high transmission channels ($a<15$ or $\\theta<0.22\\pi$ for homegeneous disorder samples $B1-B4$) is nearly equal, regardless of the disorder strength of random samples.\n\nWhile for the case of transversely inhomogeneous disorder samples (i.e. $A1-A4$), $\\left<T_{a}\\right>$ considerably depends on the incident channel $a$, which shows a relatively larger variation, and as well as a transmission peak corresponding to the most transmitted incident channel, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}. \n\nWhen the fraction of the weakly scattering layer is large enough, e.g. $f=0.2$ shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}(a), the highest transmission takes place at the incident channel with the smallest incident angle, i.e. $a=1$. When the fraction of the strongly scattering layer $f$ increases, the index of the most transmitted channel increases ($a=2,3,8$ shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig:ttt}(b-d)), which means that the incident channel with the smallest incident angle is no longer the most transmitted channel, but replaced by another channel with a larger incident angle.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{FIG6.eps}\n\\caption{Distributions of normalized total transmission $s_{a}$ for samples with (a) $g=6.33$, (b) $g=3.25$, (c) $g=1.61$ and (d) $g=0.59$. The blue circles represent the samples with homogeneous disorder, the squares represent the samples with transversely inhomogeneous disorder and the solid lines are the predictions of Eq.~\\eqref{psaphi}. }\n\\label{Fig:psa}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe distribution of the total transmission should also be modulated by the spatial structure of the transversely inhomogeneous disorder. The calculated probability densities of the normalized total transmission $s_{a}=T_{a}/\\overline{\\tau}$ (here the subscript ``$a$'' is maintained to distinguish with the transmittance $T$ and takes all the incident channels into account), i.e., $P(s_{a})$, are shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig:psa} for different conductance $g$. \n\nTheoretical prediction for $P(s_{a})$ depends on the single parameter $g$ as follows\\cite{Nieuwenhuizen1995},\n\\begin{subequations}\\label{psaphi}\n\n", "index": 23, "text": "\\begin{align}\nP(s_{a}) & =\\int_{-i\\infty}^{i\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{2\\pi i}\\exp \\left[ xs_{a}-\\Phi(x)\\right], \\label{psa}\\\\\n\\Phi(x) & =g \\mathrm{ln}^{2}\\left( \\sqrt{1+x/g}+\\sqrt{x/g} \\right). \\label{phi}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E12.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle P(s_{a})\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>a</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E12.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=\\int_{-i\\infty}^{i\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{2\\pi i}\\exp\\left[xs_%&#10;{a}-\\Phi(x)\\right],\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u221e</mi></mrow></msubsup></mstyle><mrow><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></mfrac></mstyle><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mi>exp</mi><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>s</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></mrow><mo>-</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E13.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\Phi(x)\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u03a6</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></math>\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E13.m2\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle=g\\mathrm{ln}^{2}\\left(\\sqrt{1+x/g}+\\sqrt{x/g}\\right).\" display=\"inline\"><mrow><mrow><mi/><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mi>ln</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></mrow></msqrt><mo>+</mo><msqrt><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
