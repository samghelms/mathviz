For eventual clinical application, the correct treatment of tissue mixtures and heterogeneities is an essential feature, as they naturally occur within a patient's CT. Here, we present how existing methods for DECT-based ion-range prediction can be modified in order to incorporate proper mixing behavior on several structural levels. Our approach is based on the factorization of the stopping-power ratio into the relative electron density and the relative stopping number. The latter is confined for tissue between about 0.95 and 1.02 at a therapeutic beam energy of 200 MeV/u and depends on the I-value. We show that convenient mixing and averaging properties arise by relating the relative stopping number to the relative cross section obtained by DECT. From this, a maximum uncertainty of the stopping-power ratio prediction below $1\\%$ is suggested for arbitrary mixtures of human body tissues. \n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{2pc}\n\\noindent{\\it Keywords}: proton and ion radiation therapy, treatment planning, computed tomography, volume averaging\n\n\n\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nAccurate prediction of ion ranges in tissue is essential in order to fully exploit the potential of proton and ion-beam therapy in terms of an efficient target coverage using the sharp distal dose fall-off of the Bragg peak. A large part of the uncertainties currently associated to this prediction is due to the conversion of photon attenuation from computed tomography (CT) to ion stopping-power ratios (SPRs) \\cite{Paganetti2012}. The present clinical standard for CT conversion is a one-to-one heuristic relation in the form of a Hounsfield look-up table (HLUT) \\cite{Schneider1996,Jaekel2001}. The difficulties in CT-number-to-SPR conversion arise from the linking of different physical regimes of the involved particles, i.e. photons and ions, with their associated energy-loss mechanisms in matter.\n\nDual-energy CT (DECT) provides possible improvement with an alternative prediction of SPRs.\nScanning the sample with two X-ray spectra, well-separated in energy by choosing different tube voltages, allows for the determination of radiological properties \\cite{Rutherford1976}. These can subsequently be used in a physics-based SPR prediction via the Bethe formula. The main challenge is the determination of the mean excitation energy (I-value), which enters logarithmically in the Bethe formula and has no analogue in the photon absorption regime. \\citeasnoun{Huenemohr2014a} established a two-step method of DECT-based SPR prediction. First, a relative electron density and an effective atomic number image are calculated using a proprietary algorithm (\\textsc{syngo.via} DE Rho/Z Maps, Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). Secondly, an empirical relation, established by \\citeasnoun{Yang2010}, is used to determine the I-value from the effective atomic number. The method was experimentally verified using a set of homogeneous tissue substitutes (electron-density calibration phantom 467, Gammex-RMI GmbH, Biebertal, Germany). A root-mean-square deviation of 0.6\\% was found in comparison with water-equivalent path lengths measured at a carbon-ion beam line.\n\nBuilding on these promising results for tissue substitutes, it remains to be studied how DECT-based stopping-power prediction performs in the case of real tissue and ultimately for a patient. One of the main issues going towards a more realistic situation are mixtures, which appear in CT imaging on several structural levels: chemical compounds consist of single elements in certain proportions; tissues are mixtures of different molecular base components like water, proteins, carbohydrates or lipids; and one CT voxel usually contains more than one type of tissue. All these types of mixtures are not necessarily accounted for correctly in the I-value calibration curve from \\citeasnoun{Yang2010}, where only unmixed tabulated tissues of well-defined elemental composition are considered \\cite{Woodard1986}. In particular, the calibration includes a gap in the effective atomic number between the soft and the bony tissue regions, which will be populated by CT voxels of a patient image due to volume averaging and therefore has to be dealt with \\cite{Huenemohr2014b}.\n\nHere, we present a mathematically rigorous approach for the coherent treatment of mixtures in DECT-based ion-range prediction by considering new quantities instead of the previously used I-value to effective atomic number calibration.\n\n\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{Photon attenuation}\n\nThe linear attenuation coefficient $\\mu$ of photon interaction in a medium factorizes into the electron density {\\ensuremath{n}\\xspace} and the photon absorption cross section per electron {\\ensuremath{\\sigma}\\xspace}.

According to \\eref{eq:attenuation}, it can be obtained by dividing the measured relative attenuation by the relative electron density, which is determined using DECT information beforehand.

Combining these, the point of a composite material in the variable space of relative cross sections and relative stopping numbers, ({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}), can be written as a linear combination of its set of base points, $\\{({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace})_i\\}$ according to\n\n", "index": 17, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}) = \\sum_i{{\\ensuremath{\\nu_i}\\xspace} ({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace})_i} \\, .\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E9.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"({\\widehat{\\sigma}},{\\widehat{L}})=\\sum_{i}{{\\nu_{i}}({\\widehat{\\sigma}},{%&#10;\\widehat{L}})_{i}}\\,.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>L</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mi>i</mi></munder><mrow><msub><mi>\u03bd</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>L</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mi>i</mi></msub></mpadded></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04601.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith $a=0.908 \\pm 0.012$, $b=(8.3 \\pm 3.4) \\cdot 10^{-5}$ and $m=3.48 \\pm 0.13$.\\footnote{The parameters $a$, $b$ and $m$ were calibrated with a data set of Gammex tissue substitutes from \\citeasnoun{Huenemohr2014a}, scanned in a \\textsc{Somatom Definition Flash} DECT scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany).

The second inset zooms into the region of tissue base components and displays body tissues on top. The dashed lines illustrate the calibration curves, described in \\sref{sec:uncertainties}.

On the first level, single elements are plotted. It would be straightforward to fit a unique function ${\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace})$ and use it as a calibration curve. The simple Bloch relation $I \\approx Z \\cdot 10$ eV, transformed via \\eref{eq:stopping_number} and \\eref{eq:cross_section_parameterization}, is shown for illustration purposes. However, such a calibration curve would be of very limited practical use, as a CT voxel will rarely be exclusively filled by a single element (this might nevertheless be the case for a pure one-atomic metal implant).\n\nIn the first zoomed inset of \\fref{fig:2}, elements as part of a compound up to calcium are plotted in addition. Their convex hull visualizes the variable space that can be reached admitting all possible combinations of compounds made up from elements up to calcium.\n\nIn humans, the space of possible relative stopping numbers can be drastically reduced by permitting only base components of tissue. A list of such base components with their elemental composition from \\citeasnoun[table II]{Woodard1986} was augmented with hydroxylapatite, which occurs in slight variations of the chemical composition Ca$_5$(PO$_4$)$_3$(OH) as the basis of the solid structure of bones. The convex hull of these tissue base components is shown in both insets of \\fref{fig:2}.\n\nOn the last level, the body tissues from \\citeasnoun{Woodard1986} and \\citeasnoun{White1987}\nare shown together with their convex hull. The roughly linear alignment within the groups of soft and bony tissues reflects the fact that they are mixtures of two dominating components each. In the soft tissue region, these are water and lipid, whereas proteins, carbohydrates and others, being rather close to water in the ({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace})-plane, have a smaller influence. The tabulated bony tissues are combinations of cortical bone, which is the tissue point with maximum {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace} and minimum {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}, and red or yellow marrow, respectively.\n\n\n\\subsection{Uncertainties}\\label{sec:uncertainties}\n\nFor the practical application of our approach, a specific calibration has to be defined, which assigns a unique relative stopping number to the measured relative cross section in each CT voxel. To this end, compromises have to be made, as a fixed calibration curve cannot represent all types of mixtures of tissue or other materials like implants equally well. Given a particular calibration curve, ${\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace})$, the knowledge about mixing properties can now be applied to assign a calibration uncertainty, by making use of the constraints set by the convex hull of a particular base set.\n\nWithout any weighting of particular points, we assume in a first approximation a probability distribution that is uniform within the convex hull and zero outside. With this condition, the roughly triangular shape of the convex hull of tissue base components and body tissues suggests to define a central calibration as the line outgoing from the base point with maximum {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace} and bisecting the long upper and lower borders of the convex hull (dashed lines in \\fref{fig:2}). The symmetric standard uncertainty of this calibration, $u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace})$, is accordingly defined as the difference of the upper edge and the central line divided by the square root of three \\cite{JCGM2008}. The resulting linear parameterizations of the relative stopping number and its associated standard uncertainty are summarized in \\tref{tab:calibration}.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{\\label{tab:calibration}Parameters for the calibration curves ${\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace})$ with standard uncertainties $u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace})$. The domain of definition, $D_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}}$, corresponds to the spread in {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace} of the respective convex hull (cf. \\fref{fig:2}). The linear parameterizations are of the form $X({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}) = a_X \\, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace} + b_X$ with $X = \\{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}, u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}\\}$. The maximum relative uncertainty, as stated in the last column, is reached at the lower limit of $D_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}}$ (soft tissue region).}\n\\footnotesize\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}ll|ll|ll|l}\n\\br\nclass & $D_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}}$ & $a_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}$ & $b_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}$ & $a_{u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}}$ & $b_{u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}}$ & $\\max\\limits_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}\\in D_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}}}{\\{u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}/{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}\\}}$ \\\\\n\\mr\nbody tissues           & [0.96, 1.68] & -0.0795 & 1.0861 & -0.0081 & 0.0136 & 0.6\\% \\\\\ntissue base components & [0.94, 2.26] & -0.0723 & 1.0766 & -0.0077 & 0.0175 & 1.0\\% \\\\\n\\br\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\\normalsize\n\nA maximum uncertainty of $0.6\\%$ ($1.0\\%$) is reached with this particular calibration considering body tissues (tissue base components) as the base materials. Additional sources of uncertainty are the limited validity of Bragg's additivity rule and the uncertainty of the calculated ({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace})-positions of the base points that are used for the calibration itself. Combining $u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}}$ with the uncertainty of the electron-density determination from \\citeasnoun{Huenemohr2014a}, $u_{{\\ensuremath{\\widehat{n}}\\xspace}} = 0.4\\%$, yields a maximum uncertainty of the stopping-power prediction of $0.7\\%$ ($1.1\\%$) for arbitrary mixtures of body tissues (tissue base components).\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion and outlook}\n\nHeterogeneities and tissue mixtures occur naturally in voxels of patient CT images and therefore have to be considered properly in any method for DECT-based ion-range prediction suitable for clinical application. We showed how this can be achieved by relating the I-value dependent relative stopping number to the relative cross section obtained from a DECT scan. Our approach makes a robust quantification of uncertainties possible by exploiting the mathematical structure of the considered ({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace}) variable space.\n\nThe presented results can be seamlessly complemented by experiments, performing a DECT scan of appropriate samples for electron-density determination and a range measurement at an ion-beam line. Experimental constraints are hereby relaxed to a certain degree by the electron density dropping out of the equations, allowing for more flexibility in the choice and handling of samples.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis work was partially funded by the National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology (NCRO) within the project of translation of dual-energy CT into application in particle therapy.\n\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\\bibliographystyle{jphysicsB_withTitles}  \n\\bibliography{./references}\n\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 14838, "prevtext": "\nWith the conditions of \\eref{eq:lambdai_conditions}, this linear combination is always convex. The part of the variable space that is filled by mixtures of a given set of base materials in all possible combinations thus mathematically constitutes the convex hull of those base materials.\n\nWith two measured CT numbers, DECT also provides two relative cross sections, which can principally be used interchangeably for our purpose, as they are linearly correlated \\cite{Moehler}. Without loss of generality for the conclusions drawn here, we choose the one resulting from the lower X-ray tube voltage, as it provides higher contrast between different materials due to the more pronounced $Z$-dependent photoelectric effect at lower photon energy.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Exploration of the ({\\ensuremath{\\widehat{\\sigma}}\\xspace}, {\\ensuremath{\\widehat{L}}\\xspace})-space}\n\nRelative cross sections and stopping numbers were calculated for a number of materials on different levels of complexity from chemical elements to tabulated real tissues, using the sum rules \\eref{eq:cross_section_sum_rule} and \\eref{eq:correction_factor_sum_rule} respectively.
