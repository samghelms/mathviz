They \nbelong to strongly correlated systems and are weak antiferromagnetic \n(AF) insulators, with a complex competition of local Coulomb \ninteractions, Hund's exchange coupling, crystal-field effects and very \nstrong spin-orbit interactions. The debate continues about whether \nthese systems are better viewed as a realization of:\n(i) spin-orbit Mott insulators \\cite{Moo09}, or\n(ii) an old idea of a Slater insulator with insulating behavior \nresulting from long-range AF order in a correlated electronic band \n\\cite{Car91} is also at work in iridates \\cite{Ari12,li13}, or finally  \n(iii) a mixture of both above scenarios interrelated with each other \nand contributing almost equally~\\cite{Hsi12}. \n\nThe electronic structure of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ (and to a lesser extent of\nBa$_2$IrO$_4$) was a subject of numerous investigations\n\\cite{Ari12,Moo06,Wat10,kim12} on a different level of sophistication.\nThe interest in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is motivated by its structural \nsimilarity to cuprates \\cite{Kimx2}, and indeed $d$-wave \nsuperconductivity was predicted in electron doped Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ by \nnumerical studies \\cite{Wat13}. Recently mapping of the three-band \n($d-p$) model to a single band was presented and it was shown that \nfurther neighbor hopping is necessary to describe the difference between \nhole and electron doped iridates \\cite{Ham15}. The recent experimental \nevidence seems to support the scenario that Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ is a close \nrealization of spin-orbit Mott insulator rather than a Slater system \n\\cite{Oka11,Mos14}, similar to Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ investigated using \nangle-resolved photoemission \\cite{Tor15}, optical conductivity, x-ray \nabsorption measurements, and first-principles band calculations \n\\cite{Kim08}. Recently it has been shown that strong spin-orbit \ncoupling changes radically the electronic states in Mott insulators \n\\cite{Jac09,Brz15}. Within this limit of an insulator, strong spin-orbit \ninteraction accompanied by large crystal-field effects split $t_{2g}$ \norbitals of Ir$^{4+}$ ions into fully filled manifold with effective \ntotal angular momentum $J_{\\rm eff}=3/2$ and singly occupied manifold \n$J_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ (half-filled ground state) \\cite{Bos13,Sal14}. \nConsequently, tight-binding model calculations were performed using a \nmodel for $t_{2g}$ orbitals which includes the above effects. It gives \nresults in agreement with the angle-resolved photoemission data for \nthe occupied electronic bands \\cite{Mos14}. \n\nThe origin of AF order in the ground state is more subtle. \nIt was shown by \\textit{ab initio} calculations that the Heisenberg \nsuperexchange is the largest low-energy scale but also Ising-like \ncompass interactions contribute \\cite{Kat14}. Therefore, individual \nBa$_2$IrO$_4$ layers provide a close realization of the quantum \nspin-1/2 compass-Heisenberg model \\cite{Tro10}. We note that similarly \ncomplex structure of the superexchange was established for the \nhoneycomb lattice compound Na$_2$TiO$_3$, where it takes the form of \nKitaev-Heisenberg model which is under intense discussion at present \n\\cite{Cha10}.\n\nHowever, there remain some serious doubts (supported by experimental \ndata) whether such a simplified scenario focused on $t_{2g}$ orbitals \nis indeed fully realistic \\cite{Uch14}. One has to admit that a simple \npicture and a model as simple as possible are useful tools when it \ncomes to interpretation of rather complicated experimental data. \nHowever, this is only one level of physical description. On the second \nlevel one requires much better understanding of what is going on. This \nis the aim of the present paper --- we wish to verify to what extent the \ncharge transfer from Ba ions to IrO$_4$ units is complete and whether \nthe ionic model could be used to describe the electronic structure of \nBa$_2$IrO$_4$. We are not satisfied with an idealistic picture of \nIr$^{4+}$ (with $e_g$ orbitals being empty) surrounded by O$^{2-}$ ions \nand we want to investigate the true charge densities and the magnetic \norder parameters realized in this system. To this end we constructed \na multiband $d-p$ model and performed unrestricted Hartree-Fock (HF) \ncomputations on a finite IrO$_4$ cluster which contains $4\\times 4$ Ir \nions and the accompanying $4\\times 4\\times 4$ oxygen ions --- half of \nthem located within the same plane as Ir ions, while the second half \nbeing in out-of-plane (apical) positions.\nThe model involves (per a single IrO$_4$ unit) five $5d$ orbitals at \neach Ir and $4\\times 3$ oxygen $2p$ orbitals per unit cell, and these \norbitals are occupied by:\n(i) $n_0=5+4\\times 6$ electrons, according to the formal and\nidealized ionic model, or\n(ii) a lower electron number by one electron, i.e., $n=4+4\\times 6$ \nelectrons, according to the realistic \\textit{ ab initio} computations \n\\cite{Sto12}.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. \\ref{sec:model} we introduce\nthe multiband model which includes all $5d$ states at iridium ions and \n$2p$ states at oxygen ions. The parameters of the model are specified \nin Sec. \\ref{sec:para}. The Hartree-Fock approximation for the Coulomb \ninteractions is explained in Sec. \\ref{sec:hf}, while in Sec. \n\\ref{sec:resu} we present the results of numerical calculations:\nfor the formal ionic model in \\ref{sec:ionic},\nand for the model with self-doping in Sec. \\ref{sec:self}. Here  \nwe also discuss the justification of finite self-doping (with respect \nto the electron densities in the ionic model) and the possible effect \nof electronic correlations. The paper is concluded with a short \ndiscussion and summary of the main results  in Sec. \\ref{sec:summa}.\n\n\n\\section{Model Hamiltonian}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\nThe $d-p$ Hamiltonian for IrO$_4$ plane reads, \n\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n{\\cal H}= H_{\\rm kin}+ H_{\\rm diag}+H_{\\rm so} +H_{\\rm int}.\n\\label{model}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"{\\cal H}=H_{\\rm kin}+H_{\\rm diag}+H_{\\rm so}+H_{\\rm int}.\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u210b</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>kin</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>diag</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>so</mi></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>int</mi></msub></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03985.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $c_{i\\nu,\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$ stands for the creation of an \nelectron at site $i$ in an orbital $\\nu$ with spin \n$\\sigma=\\uparrow,\\downarrow$.

They may be to a large extent \ndeduced from the previous \\textit{ab initio} studies. We have adopted \nthe values of in-plane hopping elements $(pd\\sigma)$ and $(pd\\pi)$ \nused in Ref. \\cite{kim12} for Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, and rescaled them \n(both for in-plane and out-of-plane bonds) using Harrison \nformulas \\cite{Har05} to fit the bond lengths in the structure of \nBa$_2$IrO$_4$ (reported by Moser \\textit{et al.} \\cite{Mos14}). \nThe elements $(pp\\sigma)$ and $(pp\\pi)$ were taken directly from \nRef. \\cite{rosc15} and were rescaled in a similar way.\n\nThe choice of the Coulomb elements is rather difficult due to their\nunknown screening. There are many reliable estimations for $U_d$ in \neffective models featuring only $5d$ Wannier orbitals at iridium ions \n($2p$ oxygen orbitals are absent, but effective iridium $5d$ orbitals \nare then renormalized by hybridization with oxygen $2p$ orbitals). No \nneed to say that such parameters would have to be completely different \nin the framework of the multiband $d-p$ model. A rather low value of \n$U_d\\in[1.0,2.0]$ eV was first suggested by Mazin \\textit{et al.} \n\\cite{Maz12}, but we argue that a more probable value is $U_d=3.0$ eV. \nThis value (and $J_d=0.6$ eV) were used in local density approximation \n(LDA+$U$) computations for Na$_2$IrO$_3$ \\cite{Com12,Li15} and also for \nBa$_2$IrO$_4$ \\cite{Mos14}. A similar value of \n$U_d=2.72$ eV was obtained by constrained random phase approximation in \nNa$_2$IrO$_3$ \\cite{Yam14}. Other estimates are: $U_d\\simeq 1.9$ eV \n\\cite{Ari12} and $U_d=2.5$ eV \\cite{Uch14,li13}. Following this \ndiscussion and arguments presented in Ref. \\cite{li13}, we decided to \nfix $U_d=2.5$ eV.\n\nHund's exchange elements are less screened than intraorbital Coulomb\nelements and are closer to their atomic values. For Hund's exchange \n$J_d$ between two $t_{2g}$ electrons we selected the value 0.5 eV, in\nagreement with the old semiempirical prescription ($J_d/U_d\\simeq 0.2$) \n\\cite{hunds}. The same value was used in Refs. \\cite{kim12,Maz12} while  \nslightly smaller ($J_d=0.4$ eV \\cite{Mos14}), \nvery small ($J_d=0.14$ eV \\cite{Ari12}), or larger \n($J_d=0.6$ eV \\cite{Com12,Li15}) values were also considered. For the \nsake of fixing precisely Hund's coupling tensor elements $J_{d,\\mu\\nu}$ \nwe use Table I from Ref. \\cite{Hor07} and in addition we use a \nsemiempirical formula $C\\simeq 4B$ for Racah parameters. With this \n\\textit{Ansatz} one finds $J_d=3B+C\\approx 7B$ for a pure $t_{2g}$ \nsystem \\cite{Ole12}. The $J_{d,\\mu\\nu}$ elements concerning $e_g$ \norbitals are finite and fixed again using the entries from \nTable I in Ref. \\cite{Hor07}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\vskip -2.7cm\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=14cm]{ddd.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\vskip -8.2cm\n\\caption{(Color online)\nArtist's view of the $5d$ orbital energies split by the elements \n$\\{D_1,D_2,D_3\\}$ at Ir ions in the absence of spin-orbit coupling \n($\\zeta=0$) (left), and the $d-p$ splitting $\\Delta$ Eq. \n(\\ref{Delta}) between the Ir($5d$) and O($2p$) orbitals (right).}\n\\label{fig:ddd}\n\\end{figure}\n\nUnfortunately, not much is known about the intraorbital Coulomb \nrepulsion $U_p$ at oxygen ions (in iridates). In Ref. \\cite{Kho03} \nthis parameter is estimated to be within $U_p\\in[4.0,6.0]$ eV. We \nrecall that in cuprates the values $U_p=4.5$ eV \\cite{Arr09} and \n$U_p\\simeq 4.0$ eV \\cite{Hyb89,Gra92} were considered; note that \nseveral other values were also suggested (all in the range 3-8 eV), \nwhile 6.0 eV was indicated by some experimental data \\cite{Esk91}. We \nuse below $U_p=4.4$ eV. For Hund's coupling $J_p$ at oxygen ions the \nvalues $J_p=0.6-0.8$ eV were suggested \\cite{Kho03}, while Grant and \nMcMahan computations in cuprates yield $J_p=0.8$ eV \\cite{Gra92}. \nFollowing these estimates we use below as well $J_p=0.8$ eV. \n\nTo complete the set of the Hamiltonian parameters we must provide \nestimates for the crystal-field splittings of Sec. \\ref{sec:cf}. \nThese are: $D_1=-0.07$ eV, $D_2=2.6$ eV, and  $D_3=2.0$ eV, and we \nadopted them from \\textit{ab initio} computations \\cite{Sto12}. The \n$5d$ orbital degeneracy is lifted by these terms and the orbital \nstates at Ir ions for $\\zeta=0$ are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:ddd}. \nThe $e_g$ orbitals are much higher than $t_{2g}$ ones, and the \nhighest orbital energy is found for $x^2-y^2$ orbital, similar to \nthe situation in cuprates for the corresdponding $3d$ orbital \n\\cite{Hyb89,Gra92}. \n\nThe charge-transfer gap $\\Delta$ (\\ref{Delta}) will be examined as a \ncontinuous parameter in the range from 1.0 eV up to 5.0 eV, and the \nrepresentative situation is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:ddd}. Indeed, oxygen \n$2p$ orbital energies are below the Fermi energy, but hybridization \nwith $5d$ orbitals is responsible for partial electron transfer towards \nIr($5d$) orbitals analyzed below in Sec. \\ref{sec:resu}. We have taken \n$\\Delta$ as a free parameter as its precise value is unknown. There are \nonly a few values for $\\Delta$ in the literature, and these data are \ninconclusive. In Refs. \\cite{Moo06,kim12} $\\Delta=3.3$ eV was used. \nAccording to \\textit{ab initio} computations \\cite{Sto12} of \ncharge-transfer excitations, the value of $\\Delta$ is about 2.0 eV or \nslightly larger --- this value however is not a bare parameter but \nincludes spin-orbit coupling plus strong correlation effects; thus the \nbare value could be significantly larger. In Ref. \\cite{Shi08} the \nvalue of $\\Delta=2.0$ eV is given for Na$_2$IrO$_3$. \n\nFinally, the spin-orbit coupling strength $\\zeta$ on Ir sites is large \n--- it modifies the orbital states and mixes the spin states at iridium \nions \\cite{Jac09}. It is usually assumed to be 0.4 eV \\cite{kim12}. \nA more accurate value is 0.43 eV \\cite{Sal14,Sto12} and we use it in \nthe present study. \n\nAll the parameters we use in the calculations below are collected in \nTable I. Note that during computations we are setting the value of \n$\\varepsilon_d$ to be zero as the reference energy. \nNote that the value of parameter $(pd\\sigma)$ which is involved in\nhopping processes from $t_{2g}$ to $e_g$ orbitals is $-1.69$ eV, see \nAppendix in Ref. \\cite{rosc15}, and the splitting between $t_{2g}$ \nand $e_g$ orbitals is $2.0 - 2.6$ eV. This suggests that the \nexpectation that $e_g$ levels are empty is unrealistic.\n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\caption{Parameters of the Hamiltonian (\\ref{model}) (all in eV) used \nin the HF calculations.

Frequently it is being assumed that $e_g$ orbitals are \nempty in Ba$_2$IrO$_4$. In the present paper we make an attempt to find \nthe electron densities in $e_g$ orbitals and in $2p$ oxygen orbitals. \nWe are motivated by the \\textit{ab initio} computations performed on a \nsmall cluster with embedding \\cite{Sto12}. According to Mullikan \npopulation analysis the $5d$-shell charge on Ir ions is about $6.5e$, \nthe effective ionic charge within $2p$ orbitals is about $5.2e$ on \nin-plane oxygens and about $5.6e$ on apical oxygens \\cite{Court}. Note \nhowever that the direct mapping of these entries to the $d-p$ model can \nnot be perfect as \\textit{ab initio} computations include in addition \noxygen valence $s$-orbitals, and also $s$, $p$ and $f$-orbitals at \niridium ions (absent in the $d-p$ model).\n\nNonetheless, it seems clear that the formal idealized ionic model with\n6 electrons occupying $2p$ levels of each oxygen and 5 electrons \noccupying $5d$ levels of each Ir ion can serve only as a rather crude \nstarting view for the electronic structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$. For the \nsake of convenience let us introduce the notion of \\textit{self-doping} \n$x$ for a single IrO$_4$ unit: with respect to the idealized formal \nionic model where we have $x=0$; instead for the real compound we shall \nconsider finite self-doping value $x=1.0$, i.e., one electron less per \nIrO$_4$ unit (according to Katukuri \\cite{Sto12} $x\\sim 0.8$; however \nwe shall use $x=1$ instead because our cluster is rather small and \nwhile the self-doping $x=1$ translates well into integer total electron \nnumber in the cluster, other fractional values of $x$ would not.)\n\n\n\\section{The unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation}\n\\label{sec:hf}\n\n\\subsection{The self-consistent Hartree-Fock problem}\n\nWe use the unrestricted HF approximation to investigate the\nIrO$_4$ cluster (with cyclic boundary conditions). The technical \nimplementation is the same as described in Refs. \n\\cite{Miz96a,Miz01,rosc15}. Namely, the local Coulomb interaction \nHamiltonian $H_{\\rm int}$ is replaced by mean field terms derived in \nHF approximation. The averages\n$\\langle d^\\dagger_{i\\mu,\\sigma}d_{i\\nu,\\sigma'}^{}\\rangle$ \n(which appear within this treatment) can be treated as order parameters \n(there is a similar set of order parameters for oxygens). For the \nnumerical calculations some initial values (some educated guess) have \nto be assigned to them to start the search for a self-consistent \nsolution of the HF equations. During HF iterations the order parameters \nare recalculated self-consistently until convergence.\n\n\\subsection{Hartree-Fock calculations}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.4cm]{spins11.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{(Color online) \nAntiferromagnetic spin alignment along (1,1,0) direction in  \na $4\\times 4$ IrO$_4$ cluster.

To \nobtain unbiased results, we have studied several different types \nof order, and compared the energies of the self-consistently found\nsolutions to establish the ground state. Consequently, during the \ncomputations the following scenarios were studied:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item nonmagnetic phase, the $x,y,z$ spin components at all atoms \n      were set to be zero;\n\\item ferromagnetic (FM) phase with spins aligned along (1,1,0) direction;\n\\item FM phase with spins aligned along (1,0,0) direction \n      (parallel to the $a$ axis);\n\\item FM phase with spins (at all atoms) aligned along \n      (0,0,1) direction (parallel to the $c$ axis);\n\\item AF phase with spins (at all atoms) aligned along (1,1,0) \n      direction according to the pattern shown in Fig. \\ref{fig1};\n\\item AF phase with spins (at all atoms) aligned along (1,0,0) direction \n      (like in Fig. \\ref{fig1} but with spins rotated by 45 degrees);\n\\item AF phase with spins (at all atoms) aligned along \n      (0,0,1) direction.\n\\item in addition, all the magnetic phases were studied again with an \n      additional constraint that the magnetic moments at oxygen ions \n      vanish, i.e., for nonmagnetic oxygens.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nLet us immediately comment on the the last scenario (magnetic iridiums \nand nonmagnetic oxygens): surprisingly, it yields too high HF energies \nand therefore it is never realized in the ground state. Therefore, we \nconclude that also oxygen ions contribute to the magnetic order by \ndouble exchange mechanism. \n\n\\begin{table*}[t!]\n\\caption{Results of the HF calculations for the $d-p$ model \n(\\ref{model}) concerning the magnetic order and degeneracy of HF ground \nstate for: ionic model without self-doping ($x=0$) (top), and realistic \nmodel at self-doping $x=1.0$ (bottom), as obtained for increasing \ncharge-transfer gap, $\\Delta$ (\\ref{Delta}).

The comparisons done afterwards lead us to believe that a  \npractical accuracy of our HF solutions (on convergence) is about 1-2 meV.\n\n\n\\section{Numerical results}\n\\label{sec:resu}\n\nNumerical studies of the multiband $d-p$ model (\\ref{model}) require\nnot only the parameters which were fixed in Sec. \\ref{sec:para}, but\nalso an assumption concerning the total electron number per unit cell.\nWe consider below two different scenarios:\n(i) the idealistic formal ionic model with $n_0=5+4\\times 6=29$ \nelectrons per IrO$_4$ unit, and\n(ii) the realistic model with a smaller total number of $n=29-x$ \nelectrons, where we consider only one \\textit{self-doping} namely\n$x=1.0$ \\cite{Sto12}.\nThereby we concentrate on the most important results obtained for \nrealistic values of Coulomb interactions within the framework of \nthese two different scenarios.\n\n\\subsection{Formal ionic model (self-doping $x=0$)}\n\\label{sec:ionic}\n\nTaking the formal ionic model as a starting configuration for the HF\niterations, we assume that each IrO$_4$ unit has a negative charge \n$Q=29 e$ (the two Ba$^{2+}$ ions are considered only as donors of $4e$ \nto the IrO$_4$ unit). The initial charge distribution assumed on start \nof HF iterations quickly redistributes to reach the uniform and stable  \ndistribution during the iteration process (this is achieved due to \nfinite $d-p$ hybridization).\nThe emerging ground states are shown in Table II:\nfor the ionic model with $x=0$ in the top part, and \nfor the realistic model with self-doping $x=1$ (for the discussion \nsee the next subsection) in the bottom part. \nFrom the data in the top part of Table II it follows that strong \nmagnetic degeneracy occurs for the resulting magnetic ground states \nobtained in HF approximation. It is remarkable that the values of  \ncharge densities as well as average magnetic moments and average \nangular momenta are almost the same for degenerate FM and AF HF states. \nOn the one hand, the experimentally observed antiferromagnet with \nmoments aligned along (1,1,0) direction is confirmed, but on the other \nhand its energy is degenerated with other magnetic phases. \n\nFinally, we present charge and magnetization densities obtained for the \nionic model, see Fig. \\ref{fig2}. As expected, increasing $\\Delta$ \nreduces the charge density within $5d$ Ir orbitals due to weaker \nhybridization. Notably, there is a considerable electron transfer to \n$e_g$ orbitals which contain typically more than one $e_g$ electron per \nIr ion. More precisely, the $e_g$ electron density decreases with \nincreasing $\\Delta$ from $\\sim 1.7$ to $\\sim 1.0$ in the investigated \nrange of $\\Delta$. Also charge transfer between $5d$ and $2p$ orbitals \nis found for increasing $\\Delta$, and the charge densities increase for \nboth nonequivalent oxygen positions, in-plane and apical. The density \nis closer to $\\langle n_p\\rangle=6$ obtained in the ionic picture for \napical positions, where the hybridization plays a minor role. However, \nthe most important feature is the observed disagreement of the results \nof Fig. \\ref{fig2}. with the available \\textit{ab initio} data \n\\cite{Sto12}. The charge occupations and the magnetisation densities \nfor AF (aligned along (1,1,0) direction) HF ground state are shown in \nFig. \\ref{fig2}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{q_x0.pdf}\n\\vskip .5cm\n\\includegraphics[width=8.1cm]{s_x0.pdf}\n\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{(Color online) Electron occupation and spins in the multiband \nmodel for increasing $\\Delta\\equiv-\\varepsilon_p$ obtained in the \nformal ionic model without self-doping ($x=0$).

Taking the total electron number \n$n=29-x$ with $x=1.0$ this corresponds to \\textit{self-doping} by one \nhole. The obtained ground states and their characteristics are shown \nin the bottom part of Table II while the corresponding charge and \nmagnetization densities are displayed in Fig. \\ref{fig3}. Altogether,\ntaking a representative value of $\\Delta=3.0$ eV one fnds enhanced \nelectron density in $e_g$ orbitals and all magnetic moments larger by\na factor close to 2 than those obtained in the ionic model, cf. Figs. \n\\ref{fig2} and \\ref{fig3}. \n\nFrom the lower part of Table II we conclude that AF1 is the true ground \nstate for a broad range of $\\Delta\\in [1.0,3.5]$ eV. For higher values\nof $\\Delta$ the identification of the true ground state is difficult \ndue to strong degeneracy of the lowest energy states obtained from HF \niterations for various magnetization distributions. Moreover, very \nsmall HOMO-LUMO gaps obtained frequently are direct evidence that\nmulticonfiguration HF computations would be necessary to establish the \nground state and its magnetic order in a reliable way. However, such  \nmulticonfiguration HF computations are prohibitively costly for the \nconsidered cluster, both in terms of computer power and computation \ntime. Therefore we present rather qualitative evidence which suggests \nthat the magnetic order obtained in this range of $\\Delta$ may compete \nwith other magnetic states.\n\nThus both for idealistic ionic ($x=0$) and for realistic model with \n$x=1$ it is difficult to reach definite conclusions about the nature \nof the true ground state. However one bright point are computations \nfor $x=1$ and $\\Delta=3.0$ eV. Here the HOMO-LUMO gap $G$ of 0.154 eV \nis large enough to believe that HF (without correlations) performs \nsatisfactorily. Moreover, this value is close to that reported in Ref. \n\\cite{Mos14}, and the electron occupation numbers are quite close to \nthe values reported in \\textit{ab initio} calculations \\cite{Sto12}. \nThe magnetization magnitude at iridium ions is also roughly that which\nwas found in the experiment \\cite{isobe12}.\n\n\\subsection{Sensitivity of the results to variation of Hubbard repulsion $U_d$}\n\nConsider first the electron distribution obtained for the self-doping \nmodel, see Table III. First of all, one finds almost one hole per ion\nfor O$_1$ oxygen postions in the IrO$_2$ planes, and roughly half \nof the hole at apical O$_3$ positions. This demonstrates a considerable \nhole delocalization over oxygen orbitals. Furthermore, also $e_g$ \norbitals are partly filled, as one finds the electron numbers: \n$n_{t2g}=5.42$ and $n_{eg}=1.24$ per one Ir ion. Large electron density \nin $e_g$ orbitals may be explained by a stronger $\\sigma$-bond between \n$x^2-y^2$ orbitals and O($2p_{\\sigma}$) orbitals within the IrO$_2$ \nplanes. These numbers suggest that even in the effective models which \nfeature only Ir($5d$) orbitals also $e_g$ orbitals have to be included. \n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\caption{ \nAverage electron densities $\\langle n\\rangle$, average magnetization\ndensities $\\langle S^{\\alpha}\\rangle$, and average orbital momenta \n$\\langle L^{\\alpha}\\rangle$, with $\\alpha=x,y,z$, as obtained for \n$x=1$ and $\\Delta=3.0$ eV for AF1 ground state.

However, a natural question \narises: Was this achieved by accident or are the obtained results \ngeneric (at least in some limited sense) ? To get a better insight into \nthe problem we performed numerous additional \ncomputations for different sets of Hamiltonian parameters (we could not \nafford the full study of the phase diagram as the number of parameters \ninvolved and already discussed technical issues make the computations \nrather expensive).\n\nThe results of these computations indicate that the obtained results \nare indeed generic and the selection of the parameters is quite \nrepresentative. To give an explicit example let us consider two\nadditional sets of Hamiltonian parameters:\nthe first set with  $U_d=2.$0 eV and $J_d=0.4$ eV with \nweaker correlations at iridium ions, and the second set with stronger \ncorrelations for $U_d=3.0$ eV and $J_d=0.6$ eV. All other Hamiltonian \nparameters remain unchanged (note that we keep the ratio $J_d/U_d=0.2$).\nWe make scans varying $\\Delta$ for realistic scenario when self-doping \n$x=1$ is selected. We made a search for and accepted results which give \nthe occupation numbers close to \\textit{ab initio} results, i.e., the \n$n_{t2g}+n_{eg}$ electron occupation on Ir close to 6.5. The collected \nresults are presented in Table IV (compare with Table III).\n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\caption{ \nAverage electron densities $\\langle n\\rangle$, average magnetization\ndensities $\\langle S^{\\alpha}\\rangle$, and average orbital momenta \n$\\langle L^{\\alpha}\\rangle$, with $\\alpha=x,y,z$, as obtained for \ndifferent atoms at self-doping $x=1$ and for two different sets of \nHamiltonian parameters:\\\\\n--- Top part --- for large $\\Delta=5.0$ eV, $E_{\\rm HF}=38.7174$ eV, \nHOMO-LUMO gap $G=0.138$ eV; the values of order parameters are \nalmost the same for both (energy degenerate) FM and AF ground states \n(for AF1 phase they alternate between the two sublattices); parameters: \n$U_d=2.0$ eV, $J_d=0.4$ eV.\\\\\n\n--- Lower part --- for small $\\Delta=1.5$ eV, $E_{\\rm HF}=124.8861$ eV, \nHOMO-LUMO gap $G=0.124$ eV; the ground state is FM (FM1) but the energy \nof nearly degenerate AF1 state is only by 50 meV higher; parameters: \n$U_d=3.0$ eV, $J_d=0.6$ eV.\n}\n\\begin{ruledtabular}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccccrrc}\n atom & $\\langle n\\rangle$ & $\\langle S^x\\rangle$ & $\\langle S^y\\rangle$ & $\\langle S^z\\rangle$ \n                           & $\\langle L^x\\rangle$ & $\\langle L^y\\rangle$ & $\\langle L^z\\rangle$ \\\\ \n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{8}{c}{ AF1 ground state  } \\\\\n\\hline\n  Ir   & 6.59 & 0.162 & 0.162 &  0.0  & $-0.20$ & $-0.22$ &  0.0  \\\\\n O$_1$ & 5.16 & 0.20  & 0.20  &  0.0  &  $0.03$ &  $0.03$ &  0.0  \\\\\n O$_3$ & 5.54 & 0.06  & 0.06  &  0.0  &  $0.0$  &  $0.0$  &  0.0  \\\\\n\\hline\\hline\n\\multicolumn{8}{c}{  FM1 ground state  } \\\\\n\\hline\n  Ir   & 6.58 & 0.169 & 0.169 &  0.0  & $-0.20$ & $-0.25$ &  0.0  \\\\\n O$_1$ & 5.18 & 0.19  & 0.19  &  0.0  &  $0.03$ &  $0.03$ &  0.0  \\\\\n O$_3$ & 5.53 & 0.07  & 0.07  &  0.0  &  $0.0$  &  $0.0$  &  0.0  \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{ruledtabular}\n\\label{tab:orderpar2-x1}\n\\end{table}\n\nWe emphasize that not only the electron densities and and magnetic\nmoments are similar for the two sets of parameters used in Table IV, \nbut also the populations of $t_{g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals at It ions.\nFor the first choice with $U_d=2.0$ eV, one finds: $n_{t2g}=5.38$ and\n$n_{eg}=1.22$. In the case of larger $U_d=3.0$ eV, one finds: \n$n_{t2g}=5.40$ and $n_{eg}=1.18$. Note that these densities are also \nquite close to the ones obtained for the parameters given in Table I.\n\nTo summarize, we remark that FM and AF ground states with magnetic \nmoments aligned along (1,1,0) direction are very close to each other. \nNonmagnetic ground state and states with the moments aligned along \n(0,0,1) direction are much higher in energy, thus they can be safely \nexcluded.\n\n\\subsection{Can magnetic moments in IrO$_4$ plane be aligned \nalong $z$ axis?  }\n\nThe next question one should try to answer is the magnetic anisotropy.\nWhy almost all magnetic states are aligned parallel to the plane, and \nwhat about alignments (if any) along the $z$ axis? In fact, there are \nalso ground states with magnetic moments aligned along the $z$ axis \n(perpendicular to the iridiums-oxygen plane). They occur both for the \nidealistic ionic model, (i.e., for $x=0$) and for the realistic model \n(with self-doping $x=1$). The conditions for them to appear are the \nfollowing: large $U_d$ and large $\\Delta$ (and what follows large \ncharge occupations on oxygens, close to 6$e$). \nHere we also present an example in Table V.\n\nThe electron densities obtained for large values of $\\Delta$ and the \nmagnetic states with magnetic oriented along the $z$ spin axis show\na much better hole localization at Ir ions. The hole densities at O$_1$\nand O$_3$ oxygen positions are reduced by more than a half with respect \nto their values obtained for the states presented in Tables III and IV.\nWith more holes within $5d$ orbitals, also electron densities are \nreduced to $n_{t2g}=4.41$ and $n_{eg}=1.00$, but again the density of \n$e_g$ electrons is large and also in this case it is necessary to \ninclude all five $5d$ orbitals at Ir ions.  \n\n\\begin{table}[t!]\n\\caption{ \nAverage charge occupations $\\langle n\\rangle$, average magnetic spin \ncomponents $\\langle S^{\\alpha}\\rangle$, and average orbital momenta \n$\\langle L^{\\alpha}\\rangle$, with $\\alpha=x,y,z$, obtained for different \nions the AF ground state with magnetic moments \\textit{aligned along \nthe $z$ axis}.

On the other hand, when charge densities \nwithin $2p$  oxygen orbitals become much closer to six (no holes), this \nblocks effective long-range hopping and only then the possibility of \nmagnetization along the z axis may become an option.\n\n\\subsection{Do correlations favor antiferromagnetic over ferromagnetic order ?}\n\nThe energy-degenerate ground states: FM and AF (see Table II) are a \npuzzle. The question arises which one is the true ground state. \nOn the HF level this can not be answered but only after one includes \nelectronic correlation one can get the final answer. In general the \ntask to compute the correlations is very difficult and costly. There \nis however a simple (though not rigorous) intuitive approach which \nsuggests that the AF order should be favored in the ground state.\n\nNamely let us consider configuration-interaction computations used \nin quantum chemistry to derive the correlation energy, as defined for \ninstance in Refs. \\cite{Fulde,Levine}. Let us limit ourselves only \nto double-excitions from the occupied to virtual states. For the \nHamiltonian (\\ref{model}) with the parameters from Table I \n(i.e., with large $U_d$ in the interaction part of the Hamiltonian) \nit is expected that singlet excitations are dominant and the triplet \nexcitions are probably much less important.\n\nNow consider intraatomic correlations (each of the double excitions is\ncoming out from occupied levels on some single ion \\cite{Fulde}). These \nare strictly local, i.e., for AF or FM ground state they look the same \nand most probably give the same contribution to the total correlation \nenergy. (Thus they do not differentiate between AF and FM order).\n\nIn contrast, interatomic correlations only involve excitions from \n\\textit{different} pairs of ions \\cite{Fulde}. The consequence is that, \nnaively speaking, the number of the occupied electron pairs of the \nsinglet-type (and located on different ions) is much bigger for AF \nground state. Each such occupied singlet-pair (in AF) during CI \ncomputations is annihilated (while the virtual singlet-pair is created \nat the same time) giving substantial contribution to the total singlet \ncorrelation energy. The number of occupied triplet-pairs of the \nelectrons is smaller and the triplet excitions give much smaller \ncorrelation contribution anyway (we remind that for the Hamiltonian \n(\\ref{model}) singlet excitations are probably dominant).\n\nFor the FM ground state we can apply a similar reasoning. Now, the \nnumber of occupied triplet pairs of the electrons (on different ions) \nis bigger. However, the annihilation of each such pair gives rise to \na much smaller triplet contribution to the total correlation energy.\n\nIn summary, one can expect that the total correlations contribution\nto the total ground state energy is mainly of the singlet-type\nand that the correlations contribution to the total energy is\nenhanced for AF ground state while being weaker for FM ground state.\nThus one expects that AF order should win in the ground state.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion and summary}\n\\label{sec:summa}\n\nWe have shown that the HF computational results for the assumed \nidealized ionic configuration do not describe properly the \nexperimental data for Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ for almost all studied values of \n$\\Delta$. Namely, the charge on iridium ions is 7$e$-7.5$e$, i.e., it\nis significantly higher than 6.5$e$ (as suggested by \\textit{ab initio}\n\\cite{Sto12}) and the HOMO-LUMO gap $G$ is also too large, so the \nsystem is a good insulator. Only for very large $\\Delta=5.0$ eV the \nagreement with \\textit{ab initio} calculations (charges on iridium \nand also on oxygens) improves but still the HOMO-LUMO gap is twice \nlarger than 0.14 eV expected from the experimental data \n\\cite{Oka11,Mos14}. Note that large insulating gap was found instead \nin Na$_2$IrO$_3$ \\cite{Com12}.\n\nIn contrast, the realistic model with self-doping $x=1$ is doing much\nbetter. The charges on iridium are generally smaller\n(in comparison to the $x=0$ case) and in  particular for $\\Delta=3.0$ \neV the charge occupations on both iridium and oxygens are very close \nto those indicated by \\textit{ab initio} \\cite{Sto12} and the ground \nstate:  \n(i) is antiferromagnetic aligned along (1,1,0);\n(ii) is weakly insulating (not far from being metal; $G=0.15$ eV, \ni.e., the value indicated by experimental data \\cite{Oka11,Mos14}); \n(iii) has magnetic moments with magnitude being close to the \nexperimental findings \\cite{Oka11,Mos14}; \n(iv) is characterized by some traces of weak orbital order.\n\nWe emphasize that the present treatment of the spin-orbit interaction\nis sufficient to break the SU(2) symmetry in the spin space and to \nrealize the experimentally observed type of antiferromagnetic phase. \nFurther justification to the self-doping concept comes from the hole\ndelocalization over oxygen orbitals, found practically for all \nconsidered parameter sets. This delocalization implies that also Ba\nions cannot be considered as Ba$^{2+}$ which would be the case of the \nidealistic ionic model. Furthermore, using the analogy to cuprates, we \nsuggest that also CuO$_2$ planes in the undoped high-$T_c$ materials \n\\cite{Arr09,Ole87,Lor02,Med09} cannot be considered as charged \nformally in the same way as predicted in the ionic model, i.e., \nCu$^{2+}$O$_2^{2-}$, but in agreement with recent results \\cite{Gas14}, \nself-doping is also here an important effect to include.\n\nNotably, in the Hartree-Fock analysis quantum fluctuations are \nneglected and thus both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases are \nenergetically degenerate. But by a simple reasoning one can come to \nconclusion that when including these effects and correlations beyond \nHartree-Fock, the antiferromagnetic order observed in experiment \nshould become more stable.\n\nThere are other important messages. Namely when describing IrO$_4$ \nplane in the framework of $d-p$ model numerous interesting physical \nfacts and electronic mechanisms become visible. In this respect the \n$d-p$ model is a very good supplement to simpler but more widely used \nfive-band model (featuring only Ir ions with five $5d$-type occupied \nWannier orbitals which are coming from hybridization of iridium $5d$ \nand oxygen $2p$ orbitals). Our results serve as a guideline that \neffective models such as the five-band model have to be constructed \nincluding their proper electron densities and thus indicate the \nimportance of self-doping. In other words, the formal ionic picture \n(with zero self-doping) most probably does not describe faithfully the \nelectronic states, and to introduce self-doping is a must. \nUnfortunately, in order to do it properly some preliminary \n\\textit{ ab initio} investigations (in a small cluster) are necessary.\n\nAfter completing this paper, we became aware of a very recent paper \nwhich presents a complete study of the superexchange model \\cite{Sol15}. \nThe AF phase obtained by us from the multiband model captures the \ninterplay between the spin-orbit coupling and charge excitations in \na charge-transfer insulator and agrees well with the one \nwhich follows from the low-energy superexchange model.   \n\n\\acknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to V.
