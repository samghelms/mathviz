Naturally, the same can be said about any other entropic functional, especially\nRenyi's entropy, which has withstood  very well the test of time and appears in several disciplines. We should notice that there are many aspects and relations of equilibrium \nthermodynamics that can be carried over, usually without or  with minor modifications, to the case of $\\mathcal{S}_q$, which among many things, claims \nto also describe some non-equilibrium phenomena \\cite{T-book}.  Moreover, there are numerous ongoing \nattempts to apply consequences stemming from $\\mathcal{S}_q$ to different disciplines that appear to have only minimal relation to Physics or Information Theory \n\\cite{T-book}.   Hence the scope of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ may transcend what is traditionally the domain of Physics, in essence following the case of $\\mathcal{S}_{BGS}$. \\\\\n\nSome of the above statements, however, may also be seen as possible shortcomings of $\\mathcal{S}_q$: the lack of a concrete set of thermodynamic laws\nobeyed by $\\mathcal{S}_q$ is somewhat unnerving. In particular, even definitions of basic concepts such as equilibrium,  \ntemperature etc. exist, but they appear, to us at least, to be somewhat artificial \\cite{T-book}. Also:  little is actually known about the nature and ab initio \ncalculation of the non-entropic parameter $q$ at both technical and conceptual levels. It is still quite unclear, for instance, what would be the value of $q$ \nwhen two or more systems having different values of $q$  interact with each other etc, \\cite{TT} nonwithstanding. One may have to resort to using the more general \nframework of superstatistics \\cite{BC}, rather than remain within the strict confines of the formalism of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ but this is still unclear. \\\\\n\n The dynamical foundations of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ are really not particularly well-understood. Whereas one can point out that ergodic theory and hyperbolic dynamical \n systems are underlying the use and widespread validity of $\\mathcal{S}_{BGS}$, something similar is not really known for $\\mathcal{S}_q$, or any of the other recently \n proposed  entropies. Notice that our comments  throughout this work refer only to Hamiltonian systems having many degrees of freedom. \n The accepted conjecture is that long (``fat-tailed\") spatial and temporal correlations in the underlying system should be responsible for a growth \n rate of the phase space volume which has a power law rather than exponential form, for the system to be described $\\mathcal{S}_q$ \\cite{HT}. \n However very little concrete evidence has been produced to  support or refute such claims. \n And on top of this, someone can always question why it should be $\\mathcal{S}_q$ that describes such systems, and not \nsome other entropic functional among the numerous ones that have been constructed which still has a power-law form.\n\n\n\n\\section{Occasional misunderstandings ...}\n\nIt may appear, from the above arguments, that applying the ideas and the formalism of non-additive entropies, such as $\\mathcal{S}_q$, to semi-Classical \nor Quantum Gravity may not be a  particularly fruitful endeavor. Indeed, most problems arising in the development of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ have become apparent for \nrelatively ``simple\" particle systems. Far less is known about how to apply such concepts to field theories, and even more so to Quantum Gravity candidates\nwhich have the additional conceptual and technical complications related to diffeomorphism invariance and background-independence.\\\\ \n\nIt is probably due to the numerous subtleties related to the indefinite signature of the space-time metric, to the diffeomorphism invariance of space-time and to the     \nbackground independence of Quantum Gravity that some misunderstandings have occurred in the part of the literature that attempts to \napply $\\mathcal{S}_q$ to General Relativity and Quantum Gravity. \\\\\n\nA typical case is that of the holographic nature of black hole entropy. This entropy\ndepends on the surface area of a space-like section of the event horizon for let's say the Schwarzschild solution. As a result  one might be lead to believe \nthat it the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole should somehow  be related to $\\mathcal{S}_q$ for $q\\neq 1$ since, after all, $\\mathcal{S}_{BGS}$ should be dependent on the \n``volume\" of the ``interior\" of a black hole rather than its  ``surface\" \\cite{CT}.  This apparently reasonable, but rather naive picture, is incorrect for multiple reasons. \nFirst, the volume of the interior of a black hole is not defined. The space-time metric is geodesically incomplete, something that really defines the singularity of a \nspace-time \\cite{GLG}. Second, even if one disregards the geodesic incompleteness of the metric , \nthe volume of the ``interior\" of a Schwarzschild solution depends on the choice of the space-like surface \\cite{DNM}. We could choose such a  ``volume\" to refer to a   \nminimal  space-like surface, but this would be an arbitrary and unjustified choice in the classical theory. By contrast, the surface area of any space-like section \nof the event horizon does not depend on the choice of such section and this is what is used in the entropy formulae.  \nThird, the Schwarzschild solution is static, so it has a Killing vector field which is space-like in the interior part of the solution. \nHence, trying to define the volume of the interior of such a solution is like trying to \ndetermine the volume of a cylinder: such a concept is physically meaningless due to the existence of the translation invariance along the axis of the cylinder \nwhich is an isometry; the volume of sections which are ``nice\" / ``equivariant\" under such isometries is what is actually physically relevant.  \n  \n\n\n\\section{Possible applications to Semi-classical and Quantum Gravity.}\n\nOne cannot help wondering about the possibility of applying $\\mathcal{S}_q$ to Gravity. After all, neither black hole entropy nor Quantum Gravity are particularly\nwell-understood, so it may pay off to find ``unusual\" paths toward resolving such problems.\nOur current attitude toward this is more favorable than not. \nSome of the reasons are: \n\\begin{romanlist}\n     \\item In the Newtonian framework, gravity is a long-range interaction (in 3 and 4 dimensions). Some studies and corresponding arguments involving long-range \n              interactions, such as in space plasmas, seem to point out, according to their authors at least \\cite{Liv}, that the equilibrium distributions that can be derived by applying \n              the Maximum Entropy Principle to $\\mathcal{S}_q$, the so-called q-exponentials $e_q(x)$, appear to be a good fit to recently obtained observation data. \n              So, it may be worth considering the possibility of Statistical Mechanics of gravitating systems that relies on $\\mathcal{S}_q$.      \n     \\item It seems that correlations have a significant role to play in understanding the statistical basis of the black hole, and more generally,  the holographic nature \n              of  ``gravitational\" entropy. If such correlations turn out to be strong enough to allow the phase space volume to grow in a power-law manner \\cite{HT}, \n              but not faster, power-law entropies, such as $\\mathcal{S}_q$, may be needed for thermodynamics.\n     \\item The naive path-integral approach to quantization, which was developed mostly during the 1960s, indicates that gravity is perturbatively (around a Minkowski \n              background, at least) non-renormalizable.

We should notice that there are many aspects and relations of equilibrium \nthermodynamics that can be carried over, usually without or  with minor modifications, to the case of $\\mathcal{S}_q$, which among many things, claims \nto also describe some non-equilibrium phenomena \\cite{T-book}.  Moreover, there are numerous ongoing \nattempts to apply consequences stemming from $\\mathcal{S}_q$ to different disciplines that appear to have only minimal relation to Physics or Information Theory \n\\cite{T-book}.   Hence the scope of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ may transcend what is traditionally the domain of Physics, in essence following the case of $\\mathcal{S}_{BGS}$. \\\\\n\nSome of the above statements, however, may also be seen as possible shortcomings of $\\mathcal{S}_q$: the lack of a concrete set of thermodynamic laws\nobeyed by $\\mathcal{S}_q$ is somewhat unnerving. In particular, even definitions of basic concepts such as equilibrium,  \ntemperature etc. exist, but they appear, to us at least, to be somewhat artificial \\cite{T-book}. Also:  little is actually known about the nature and ab initio \ncalculation of the non-entropic parameter $q$ at both technical and conceptual levels. It is still quite unclear, for instance, what would be the value of $q$ \nwhen two or more systems having different values of $q$  interact with each other etc, \\cite{TT} nonwithstanding. One may have to resort to using the more general \nframework of superstatistics \\cite{BC}, rather than remain within the strict confines of the formalism of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ but this is still unclear. \\\\\n\n The dynamical foundations of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ are really not particularly well-understood. Whereas one can point out that ergodic theory and hyperbolic dynamical \n systems are underlying the use and widespread validity of $\\mathcal{S}_{BGS}$, something similar is not really known for $\\mathcal{S}_q$, or any of the other recently \n proposed  entropies. Notice that our comments  throughout this work refer only to Hamiltonian systems having many degrees of freedom. \n The accepted conjecture is that long (``fat-tailed\") spatial and temporal correlations in the underlying system should be responsible for a growth \n rate of the phase space volume which has a power law rather than exponential form, for the system to be described $\\mathcal{S}_q$ \\cite{HT}. \n However very little concrete evidence has been produced to  support or refute such claims. \n And on top of this, someone can always question why it should be $\\mathcal{S}_q$ that describes such systems, and not \nsome other entropic functional among the numerous ones that have been constructed which still has a power-law form.\n\n\n\n\\section{Occasional misunderstandings ...}\n\nIt may appear, from the above arguments, that applying the ideas and the formalism of non-additive entropies, such as $\\mathcal{S}_q$, to semi-Classical \nor Quantum Gravity may not be a  particularly fruitful endeavor. Indeed, most problems arising in the development of $\\mathcal{S}_q$ have become apparent for \nrelatively ``simple\" particle systems. Far less is known about how to apply such concepts to field theories, and even more so to Quantum Gravity candidates\nwhich have the additional conceptual and technical complications related to diffeomorphism invariance and background-independence.\\\\ \n\nIt is probably due to the numerous subtleties related to the indefinite signature of the space-time metric, to the diffeomorphism invariance of space-time and to the     \nbackground independence of Quantum Gravity that some misunderstandings have occurred in the part of the literature that attempts to \napply $\\mathcal{S}_q$ to General Relativity and Quantum Gravity. \\\\\n\nA typical case is that of the holographic nature of black hole entropy. This entropy\ndepends on the surface area of a space-like section of the event horizon for let's say the Schwarzschild solution. As a result  one might be lead to believe \nthat it the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole should somehow  be related to $\\mathcal{S}_q$ for $q\\neq 1$ since, after all, $\\mathcal{S}_{BGS}$ should be dependent on the \n``volume\" of the ``interior\" of a black hole rather than its  ``surface\" \\cite{CT}.  This apparently reasonable, but rather naive picture, is incorrect for multiple reasons. \nFirst, the volume of the interior of a black hole is not defined. The space-time metric is geodesically incomplete, something that really defines the singularity of a \nspace-time \\cite{GLG}. Second, even if one disregards the geodesic incompleteness of the metric , \nthe volume of the ``interior\" of a Schwarzschild solution depends on the choice of the space-like surface \\cite{DNM}. We could choose such a  ``volume\" to refer to a   \nminimal  space-like surface, but this would be an arbitrary and unjustified choice in the classical theory. By contrast, the surface area of any space-like section \nof the event horizon does not depend on the choice of such section and this is what is used in the entropy formulae.  \nThird, the Schwarzschild solution is static, so it has a Killing vector field which is space-like in the interior part of the solution. \nHence, trying to define the volume of the interior of such a solution is like trying to \ndetermine the volume of a cylinder: such a concept is physically meaningless due to the existence of the translation invariance along the axis of the cylinder \nwhich is an isometry; the volume of sections which are ``nice\" / ``equivariant\" under such isometries is what is actually physically relevant.  \n  \n\n\n\\section{Possible applications to Semi-classical and Quantum Gravity.}\n\nOne cannot help wondering about the possibility of applying $\\mathcal{S}_q$ to Gravity. After all, neither black hole entropy nor Quantum Gravity are particularly\nwell-understood, so it may pay off to find ``unusual\" paths toward resolving such problems.\nOur current attitude toward this is more favorable than not. \nSome of the reasons are: \n\\begin{romanlist}\n     \\item In the Newtonian framework, gravity is a long-range interaction (in 3 and 4 dimensions). Some studies and corresponding arguments involving long-range \n              interactions, such as in space plasmas, seem to point out, according to their authors at least \\cite{Liv}, that the equilibrium distributions that can be derived by applying \n              the Maximum Entropy Principle to $\\mathcal{S}_q$, the so-called q-exponentials $e_q(x)$, appear to be a good fit to recently obtained observation data. \n              So, it may be worth considering the possibility of Statistical Mechanics of gravitating systems that relies on $\\mathcal{S}_q$.      \n     \\item It seems that correlations have a significant role to play in understanding the statistical basis of the black hole, and more generally,  the holographic nature \n              of  ``gravitational\" entropy. If such correlations turn out to be strong enough to allow the phase space volume to grow in a power-law manner \\cite{HT}, \n              but not faster, power-law entropies, such as $\\mathcal{S}_q$, may be needed for thermodynamics.\n     \\item The naive path-integral approach to quantization, which was developed mostly during the 1960s, indicates that gravity is perturbatively (around a Minkowski \n              background, at least) non-renormalizable. The corresponding questions about supergravities \\cite{Kal} or string-inspired ``low-energy\" actions are still unresolved. \n              So, one is tempted to try to consider path integrals/``partition functions\" based on $q$-exponentials and generalized curvature actions, such as      \n              \n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n                     \\mathcal{Z}_q \\ = \\  \\int_\\mathfrak{M} e_q^{S_q} \\  \\mathcal{D}_\\mathfrak{M}      \n              \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathcal{Z}_{q}\\ =\\ \\int_{\\mathfrak}{M}e_{q}^{S_{q}}\\ \\mathcal{D}_{\\mathfrak}{M}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcb5</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mpadded><mo rspace=\"7.5pt\">=</mo><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\mathfrak</mtext></merror></msub><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msubsup><mi>e</mi><mi>q</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></msubsup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udc9f</mi><merror class=\"ltx_ERROR undefined undefined\"><mtext>\\mathfrak</mtext></merror></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04701.tex", "nexttext": "\n              where the generalized scalar curvature \\ $\\mathrm{Scal}_q [\\mathbf{g}, \\phi]$ \\  is  given by \\cite{Lott}\n              \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 15041, "prevtext": "\n              where $\\mathfrak{M}$ is the space of pairs of (ultimately Euclidean signature) metrics of the background manifold $\\mathbf{M}$ and functions \n                  $\\phi: \\mathbf{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, with  $\\mathcal{D}_\\mathfrak{M}$ being a \n              judiciously chosen  measure (such as a $q$-Gaussian) on $\\mathfrak{M}$ and a measure on the space of functions $\\phi$ \n               determining a conformal deformation of the volume $d\\nu = \\ e^{-\\phi} dvol_\\mathbf{M}$. \\  \n              The action $S_q$, familiar as the action of the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theory of gravity in the Jordan frame, is \n              \n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n                     S_q \\ = \\ \\int_\\mathbf{M}  \\mathrm{Scal}_q [\\mathbf{g}, \\phi]  \\  e^{-\\phi} \\  dvol_\\mathbf{M}\n              \\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S_{q}\\ =\\ \\int_{\\mathbf{M}}\\mathrm{Scal}_{q}[\\mathbf{g},\\phi]\\ e^{-\\phi}\\ dvol%&#10;_{\\mathbf{M}}\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mpadded><mo rspace=\"7.5pt\">=</mo><mrow><msub><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mi>\ud835\udc0c</mi></msub><mrow><msub><mi>Scal</mi><mi>q</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>\ud835\udc20</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi><mo rspace=\"7.5pt\" stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>-</mo><mi>\u03d5</mi></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>v</mi></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>o</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>l</mi><mi>\ud835\udc0c</mi></msub></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.04701.tex", "nexttext": "\n              as is suggested by arguments based on optimal transport \\cite{S-LV}.
