The chlorosomes are self-assembled structures of hundreds of thousands bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. They differ from other light-harvesting complexes by the {absence} of a\nprotein matrix {which} supports the {photosynthetic} pigments and their very large size with lengths up to 200 nm \\cite{Holzwarth90}.\nChlorosomes usually function in extremely low light conditions and are thus probably the most efficient light-harvesting\nantenna complexes in nature \\cite{Blankenship_book}.\nThese special properties {makes the chlorosome} a potential candidate for use in biomimetic light-harvesting devices \\cite{Modesto10,Sridharan09}.\nDue to the heterogeneity of chlorosomes their structure cannot be determined by crystallographic methods and structural information is scarce. However, thanks to recent advances in different areas, a structural model has been put forward for cholorosomes of the green sulfur bacterium {\\em Chlorobaculum tepidum} \\cite{Ganapathy09}. This model is based\non a {\\em syn-anti} array of BChl c pigments in tubular shape. One of the methods that were used to determine\nthe structure of the chlorosome was to study mutant bacteria with three genes whose expression was prevented. The mutant bacteria have a more ordered structure of BChls which allowed X-ray crystallographic studies and showed the presence of an helical structure. Interestingly enough, the mutant bacteria growth was much slower than the wild type bacteria. This observation together with the fact that the function of three genes was suppressed in order to make the structure less disordered hints to the possibility that disorder plays a biological function in chlorosomes and\na disordered structure is favored by evolution. The obvious role for disorder is the broadening of the optical spectra that in an ordered structure would be too narrow as observed in similar artificial supramolecular structures \\cite{Ganapathy09}.\n\n\n\nHowever, these results are paradoxical since disorder is also expected to localize the excitonic wave functions and inhibit energy diffusion according to the theory of Anderson localization. Since the seminal paper of Anderson on the absence of diffusion for disordered quantum lattices \\cite{Anderson58}, wave localization due to interference has been a central theme in condensed matter physics. One of the main tools\nfor studying localization phenomena and, in general, disordered quantum systems has been Random Matrix Theory (RMT)\n\\cite{Mehta_Book}. The RMT approach has also been applied to probe thermodynamic properties of closed systems as well as transport properties of open systems. One of the important results in the field is the statistical relationship between the spectral repulsion\nparameter $\\beta$ and the wave function localization. The $\\beta$ parameter can be used to locate the metal-insulator transtion in three dimensions \\cite{Evers08} and it has been shown that there are specific scaling laws between localization and the repulsion parameter in finite, disordered one-dimensional systems \\cite{Izrailev89,Izrailev90,Casati93,Sorathia12}. Localization in systems with dipolar interactions like the natural light-harvesting complexes have been shown to be much weaker than for the Anderson model with only nearest neighbor coupling \\cite{Rodriguez03}. Quantum transport in disordered networks has been extensively studied in connection with its relevance for efficient energy transfer in light-harvesting systems. Centrosymmetry and a dominant doublet spectral structure has been stablished as a general mechanism for highly efficient quantum transport even in the presence of disorder and the natural implementation of this mechanism in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) { complex} of green sulfur \nbacteria has also been explored \\cite{Walschaers13}.  \n\nThe extraordinary energy transfer properties of chlorosomes are attributed to cooperative phenomena in the BChl aggregates, which are known otherwise as superradiance and supertransfer. Superradiance occurs when a group of emitters, situated at a distance from each other shorter than the wave length of the light, emits coherently with a very high intensity, and was discovered by Dicke in the context of radiating atoms \\cite{Dicke54}. It has\nbeen studied for supramolecular complexes and in the light-harvesting apparatus of bacterial photosynthesis \\cite{Meier97,Zhao99}.\nIn the presence of disorder, static or dynamic,\nsuperradiance is quenched, although, \nin a tight-binding model in a ring superradiance persists for disorder strengths below a critical value even in a regime with strong coupling to the external environment {\\cite{Celardo14}}.  The optical properties of\none-dimensional disordered excitonic systems have been studied extensively, specially in the context of applications to J-aggregates {\\cite{Knapp84,aggregates_book}}. The localization length of the system has been shown to limit the number of monomers contributing to the superradiance {\\cite{Fidder91}}. These results should also apply to\nsupertransfer, a coined term describing non-radiative excitonic transfer of a superradiant patch {\\cite{Strek77,Lloyd2010, Abasto12}}. {Supertransfer has been ascribed to play a crucial role in the efficiency enhancement of light-harvesting systems, and in the chlorosome in particular \\cite{Kassal2013, Huh2014}. Photosynthetic systems are arranged in hierarchical structures where energy funnelling from the chlorosome antenna towards the reaction center proceeds throughout a network of superradiant units. Supertransfer refers to the excitation energy transfer (EET) between these superradiant patches}. The properties of cylindrical chlorosomes have been studied before in the homogeneous case \\cite{Didraga02} and in the disordered case \\cite{Didraga04}. Attempts have also been made at describing the excitonic dynamics in the presence of a bath using a high-temperature, stochastic treatment attributed to Haken and Strobl \\cite{Fujita12,Yejun12,Moix13}.\n\nIn this paper, we study the effects of disorder on the localization properties, the spectral statistics and the optical properties, in particular, superradiance, of chlorosomes. We try to give an answer to the previously\nmentioned paradox. The long range properties of the dipolar interaction between chromophores make the excitonic\nwave functions more robust against localization. { However}, for realistic values of disorder and size, there appears a localization-delocalization crossover as a function of the excitonic energy as monitored by the inverse participation ratio and the spectral statistics. Precisely in the low-energy region where\nthere { appears} more collectiveness in the optical behavior of the states for the clean system, {the exciton is} more localized when disorder is included. { In the presence of static disorder, there} is {thus a} compromise between {the collective but localized }low energy {states} ({with }less nodes in the wave function) and delocalization which happens at\nhigh energy. { We find that the} maximum of superradiance appears at the localization-delocalization crossover\nand moves to the high energy side of the spectrum as disorder increases. An optimal value of disorder depending on the environmental conditions exists between sufficient superradiance and a wide spectrum that could help explain the energy transfer properties\nof chlorosomes. The plan of the paper is the following: we present the realistic model for a single rod in Sec. \\ref{sec:model}, the results for the spectral statistics, wave function localization and optical properties are shown in Sec. \\ref{sec:results} and, finally, some conclusions are drawn in Sec. \\ref{sec:conclusions} with some comments on the possibility of probing experimentally these theoretical results.\n\n\n\n\\section{Model for a single rod}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{fig1.eps}\n\\caption{\\label{fig:structure} Sketch of the arrangement of pigments in the chlorosome complex of {\\em Cf. aurantiacus}.

For example, the superradiance size is quickly reduced to one with rising temperature. It was also shown that the effect of exciton-phonon coupling on the superradiance size closely resembles that of the static disorder \\cite{Meier97}.\nHere, considering only static disorder, the superradiance size is limited by two factors: 1) it cannot be larger than the localization length; and 2)\nit cannot be larger than the typical size of the nodal structure (the inverse of the absolute value of the momentum for systems with translational symmetry). In the pristine system when the states are delocalized over the entire system, the localization length is\nnot a limiting factor, and most of the {oscillator} strength is concentrated in the state with zero momentum. In the disordered\ncase as the localization length increases with energy while the nodal size decreases with energy there will be a maximum of {superradiance} when the localization length is approximately equal to the nodal size and there is a state\nwith coherence along the whole localization region.

We have studied the effect of disorder in superradiance of chlorosomes of {\\em Cf.~aurantiacus} using the excitonic model developed recently by Ganapathy {\\em {et} al.} \\cite{Ganapathy09}. The dipolar long-range interaction makes disorder not very effective for localizing the excitonic states for cylindrical chlorosomes. However, using tools of Anderson localization theory and spectral statistics such as the IPR and the repulsion parameter $\\beta$ we have shown that there is a localization-delocalization crossover as a function of the excitonic energy that is seen both in the wave function statistics and in the spectral statistics. This kind of supramolecular aggregates concentrate the optical active energy region at low energies were the collective effects of the coupled molecular dipoles are most important. There is, then, a\ncompetition between localization and collectiveness (or state coherence) and the more optical active region where superradiance occurs coincides with the crossover region between localization and delocalization. The results found in this work should be applicable to other different supramolecular aggregates \\cite{Zhao00,Hu07}. These states where the absorption is largest are also the ones expected to dominate the energy transfer. The collective supertransfer effect is still important in spite of disorder and should increase dramatically the single dipole transfer rates. There has been experiments that have shown level repulsion via analysis of\nthe fluoresence spectra in J-aggregates \\cite{Malyshev07,Augulis10}. Similar experiments as a function of the size could be performed for chlorosomes to probe the level repulsion\nin the optically active region and as a consequence the localization of the wave functions with respect to the total size of the chloromeses. The results should be different in the wild type case, more disordered, than for less disordered mutants. \n\nIt would also be very interesting to extend the results obtained to the case of coupling to a thermal environment. Studying the transport and absorption properties of the one-dimensional Anderson model coupled to a bath, it has been shown that the maximal diffusion rate occurs at intermediate coupling strength \\cite{Moix13}. These results are reminiscent of our results as a function of the energy. These theoretical observations have been linked to the phenomenom of {\\em momentum rejuventation} apart from the role of dephasing in the destruction of destructive interference leading to Anderson localization \\cite{Li15}. The momentum rejuvenation occurs when classical noise counteracts the depletion of high momentum components of the wave-packet suistaining a broad momentum distribution. Realistic models, such as the one explored in this work, in the presence of a thermal bath should be explored in order to understand better the role of these general design principles \\cite{Walschaers13} in the actual behavior \nof chlorosomes as light-harvesting complexes.    \n\n\n\nThis work was supported in part by Spanish MINECO project FIS2012-34479, CSIC project I-Link0938, CAM research consortium QUITEMAD+ S2013/ICE-2801, and the Singapore National Research Foundation through the Competitive Research Programme under Project No.~NRF-CRP5-2009-04.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{xx}\n\n\n\\bibitem{Frigaard06} Frigaard, N.U.
