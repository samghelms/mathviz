This coupling is manifested in dynamical effects such as the modification of transition probabilities and cross sections for the excitation of the PDR. This has been observed in the past in the context of the excitation of double giant dipole resonances (DGDR) \\cite{BB88,ABE98,BP99}. The observation of the DGDR in experiments is a consequence of higher-order effects in relativistic Coulomb excitation and arises because the large excitation probabilities of giant resonances in heavy ion collisions at small impact parameters. The dynamical coupling between the usual giant resonances and the DGDR is very strong, as shown, e.g., in Ref. \\cite{Bert96}.   In the present work we make an assessment of this effect on the excitation of the PDR using the relativistic coupled channels (RCC) equations introduced in Ref. \\cite{Ber05}.  As we do not want to dwell with the microscopic properties of the pygmy and giant resonances, we will assume that they are described by  Lorentzian functions  centered at the energies  $E_{PDR}$ for pygmy dipole resonances and $E_{GDR}$ ($E_{GQR}$) for the isovector (isoscalar) giant dipole (quadrupole)  resonances. Their respective widths are denoted by $\\Gamma_{PDR}$, $\\Gamma_{GDR}$ and $\\Gamma_{GQR}$. Further, this strength function is subdivided into 35 energy bins  bins centered around the PDR energy and  the same number of energy bins centered around the GDR and GQR resonances.  \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.34]{cc1.pdf}\n\\caption{Coulomb excitation cross section as a function of the excitation energy of 600 MeV/nucleon  $^{68}$Ni projectiles incident on $^{197}$Au targets.

The reactions $^{68}{\\rm Ni}+^{197}{\\rm Au}$ and  $^{68}{\\rm Ni}+^{208}{\\rm Pb}$ are taken as a practical examples. Our goal is to address the question of the influence of giant resonances on the PDR as the dynamics of the collision evolves. We show that the coupling to the giant resonances affects considerably the excitation probabilities of the PDR, a result that indicates the need of an improved theoretical treatment of the reaction dynamics at these bombarding energies.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n \\pacs{}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\nThe existence of collective vibrations in neutron-rich nuclei at low energies was suggested by Kubono, Nomura,  and collaborators in a 1987 proposal for the Japanese Hadron project which eventually became the J-PARC facility \\cite{NS87}. This proposal was later given theoretical support by Ikeda \\cite{Ike88} and collaborators. It took nearly two decades for experimental evidences of the existence of a collective low energy response to be found in neutron-rich nuclei, far from the valley of stability.  It is worthwhile mentioning that  direct breakup of light and loosely-bound projectiles, such as $^{11}$Be and $^{11}$Li were initially thought to be indicative of a collective nuclear response but it was shown to be a direct Coulomb dissociation of the weakly-bound  valence nucleons  \\cite{BM90}.  The fragmentation of the nuclear response in the low-lying energy is  now called Pygmy Dipole Resonances (PDR) \\cite{Lei01}. The energy spectrum is typically obtained with the experimental probe of choice, i.e., relativistic Coulomb excitation of projectiles  produced and accelerated in radioactive beam facilities  (for related reviews, see Refs. \\cite{Aum05, AN13}).  In such a process,   the identification of pygmy resonances is done via their decay modes, usually via gamma or neutron emission, and the energy spectrum is obtained by invariant mass reconstruction from the energy of the fragments \\cite{Lei01}.  PDRs are typically interpreted as due to the oscillation of the excess neutrons against a more tightly bound core.  \n\nTheories for giant resonances date back to when a simple hydrodynamical interpretation of protons  oscillating against the neutrons was used \\cite{Gold48,Stein50}. Later on  microscopic calculations were developed based on the linear response theory \\cite{Bar60}. Nowadays, an effort is being undertaken to describe nuclear collective motion with more elaborated models such as the time-dependent superfluid local density approximation \\cite{Bul13,Ste15}.   Similarly, theoretical studies of the pygmy resonances have been developed based on the improvements of the hydrodynamical model \\cite{Suz90,Ber07}, and with microscopic theories such as the random phase approximation (RPA) and its variants \\cite{Paa07,Kre09,Pon14,Pap14}. When reactions with radioactive beams became the focus of nuclear research in the last decades, it was soon realized that slight modifications of the linear response theory predict  a considerable concentration at low energies of the excitation strength in neutron-rich nuclei \\cite{BF90,Ter91}.  As a word of caution, the amount of the sum rule exhausted by the nuclear response at low energies strongly depends on how the nuclear interaction, pairing, and other physical phenomena are incorporated in the theory \\cite{Paa07,Kre09,Pon14,Pap14,BF90,Ter91}.

In this work our objective is to study the effects of the coupling between the several giant resonances with the PDR, and therefore we will only calculate the excitation function d$\\sigma$/dE without concern for the decay channels. We use $E_{PDR}=11$ MeV, consistent with Refs. \\cite{Wie09,Ros13}, but a full width at half maximum of 2 MeV, which is more in line with theoretical calculations \\cite{Vret01,Ber07,Paa07,Kre09,Pon14,Pap14,BF90,Ter91}  than with the experimental data \\cite{Wie09,Ros13}. The larger PDR width also allows us to better determine the higher-order effects on the modification of the tails of the PDR. \n\nFor the (isovector) 1$^-$ giant dipole resonance (GDR) we assume $E_{GDR}= 17.2$ MeV and $\\Gamma_{GDR}=4.5$ MeV and for the (isoscalar) 2$^+$ giant quadrupole resonance (GQR) we take $E_{GQR}=15.2$ MeV and $\\Gamma_{GQR}=4.5$ MeV.

The calculations are CPU intensive but can be reduced for the practical purposes because the major dynamical effect arises from the coupling of the PDR with the GQR via the dominant E1 interaction at relativistic bombarding energies.  The number of channels can also be reduced by a factor of 2 by means of a coarser binning of the PDR and GQR states with a loss of accuracy at the level of 10\\%.

The sum runs over the relevant multipoles, here E1 and E2 stand for $1^-$ and $2^+$ excitations, respectively. It is quite evident from the figure that the coupling between these states has a visible impact on the energy dependence of the cross sections. We notice that according to the Brink-Axel hypothesis, a giant resonance can be excited on top of any other state in a nucleus \\cite{Bri55,Axe62}. Therefore, the couplings are in fact a manifestation of (PDR$\\otimes$GQR)$_{1^-}$, (PDR$\\otimes$PDR)$_{2^+}$, (PDR$\\otimes$GDR)$_{2^+}$ and (GDR$\\otimes$GQR)$_{1^-}$ states which are of our interest, as they build up components of the PDR, GDR and GQR. The importance of our findings lies on the reliability of the  experimental extraction of the PDR strength relative to that of the GDR. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{pigmycomp.pdf}\n\\caption{Coulomb excitation cross section as a function of the excitation energy of 600 MeV/nucleon  $^{68}$Ni projectiles incident on $^{197}$Au targets.

In Figure  \\ref{cc1}  the modification of the population of PDR and GQR states are shown separately.  Because the $1^-$ states in the GDR region  are very weakly affected by the coupling to the other states, we left them out of the figure as we want to concentrate on the PDR excitation spectrum.  The GDR excitation dominates  in  the high energy region by a factor of $2-3$ times that of the 2$^+$ states. The main modifications in the excitation spectrum comes from the couplings ${\\rm PDR} \\longleftrightarrow {\\rm GQR} \\longleftrightarrow {\\rm PDR}$ by E1 fields, while the couplings ${\\rm PDR}  \\longleftrightarrow {\\rm GDR}  \\longleftrightarrow  {\\rm PDR}$ by E2 fields contribute very little to the 1$^-$ states in the PDR energy region. We also see in Figure \\ref{cc1} that the tails of the PDR, and to a minor extent those of the GQR, are appreciably modified. A small shift of the peaks also occurs, although barely visible for the PDR, it is evident for the GQR. \n\nIn Figure \\ref{cc2} we singled out the energy region of the pygmy resonance and we plot the results of our calculations for two different bombarding energies: 100 MeV/nucleon and 2 GeV/nucleon, with the same notation as in Figure \\ref{cc1}. The coupling effects change dramatically. At the lower energy the influence of the giant resonances is to increase appreciably the response in the energy region of the PDR, while at the higher energy the effect of coupling is much smaller and the tendency is to slightly decrease the PDR excitation cross section. This result is expected because at  energies around 100 MeV/nucleon the E2 field is dominant, with an appreciable increase of  the excitation of the GQR and a consequently strong feedback to the PDR via subsequent E1 transitions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.38]{CS.pdf}\n\\caption{Coulomb excitation cross sections of the PDR as a function of the bombarding energy of   $^{68}$Ni projectiles incident on $^{197}$Au targets.

The filled circles represent the calculations using first-order perturbation theory, while the filled squares are the results of coupled-channel calculations. At lower energies the deviation is clearly more pronounced. At 600 MeV/nucleon the cross section for excitation of the PDR changes from 80.9 mb obtained with the virtual photon method to 92.2 mb with the coupled-channels calculation. If this is reflected in the extracted PDR strength from the experimental data, it amounts to an appreciable change of 14\\%. It implies a reduction by approximately the same amount of the strength needed to reproduce the experimental data.  \n\nWe have also performed calculations for  $^{68}{\\rm Ni}+^{208}{\\rm Pb}$ at 503 MeV/nucleon, corresponding to the experiment of Ref. \\cite{Ros13}. The Coulomb excitation cross section for the PDR in $^{58}$Ni to first-order is  found to be 57.1 mb, while when couplings to the giant resonances are included, the cross section increases to 61.4 mb, i.e., a rather small but still important 7.5\\% correction.

If a linear relationship between the dipole polarizability and the neutron skin is assumed \\cite{Pie11},  a reduction of the neutron skin from 0.17 fm, as reported in Ref. \\cite{Ros13}, to 0.16 fm is to be expected. Such a correction still lies within the experimental error \\cite{Ros13}. \n\nWe conclude that due to the large Coulomb excitation probabilities of giant resonances in heavy ion collisions at energies around and above 100 MeV/nucleon,  the excitation of the PDR is also appreciably modified due to the coupling between the $1^-$ and $2^+$ states. Our calculations are simplified with the use of a Lorentz-like distribution of the electromagnetic response and sum-rules, without a detailed nuclear structure model. In the future it might be possible to carry out nearly ``ab-initio\" calculations based on a microscopic theory, coupled with a proper reaction mechanism. A known alternative, already used in previous studies of multiphonon  resonances \\cite{PB98}, is to  use individual states calculated with the RPA or other microscopic together with higher order perturbation theory. Finally,  one might also use advanced mean-field time-dependent method such as that developed in Ref. \\cite{Ste15}. The relevance to derive rather accurate dipole strength distributions from electromagnetic  excitation of the PDR is mainly due to the extraction of the dipole polarizability \\cite{Ros13}, which is an important observable to constrain the symmetry energy, and is thus also important for the understanding of neutron-star properties. The low-energy response is particularly important for the polarizability due to the inverse weighting with energy. This opens really exciting possibilities for the studies of the pygmy resonance in nuclei and use it as a tool for applications in nuclear astrophysics.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement} \n\nThis work was supported in part by the U.S. DOE grants DE-FG02-08ER41533 and  the U.S. NSF Grant No. 1415656.\n\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{NS87} T.

The sum runs over the relevant multipoles, here E1 and E2 stand for $1^-$ and $2^+$ excitations, respectively. It is quite evident from the figure that the coupling between these states has a visible impact on the energy dependence of the cross sections. We notice that according to the Brink-Axel hypothesis, a giant resonance can be excited on top of any other state in a nucleus \\cite{Bri55,Axe62}. Therefore, the couplings are in fact a manifestation of (PDR$\\otimes$GQR)$_{1^-}$, (PDR$\\otimes$PDR)$_{2^+}$, (PDR$\\otimes$GDR)$_{2^+}$ and (GDR$\\otimes$GQR)$_{1^-}$ states which are of our interest, as they build up components of the PDR, GDR and GQR. The importance of our findings lies on the reliability of the  experimental extraction of the PDR strength relative to that of the GDR. \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.47]{pigmycomp.pdf}\n\\caption{Coulomb excitation cross section as a function of the excitation energy of 600 MeV/nucleon  $^{68}$Ni projectiles incident on $^{197}$Au targets.

In Figure  \\ref{cc1}  the modification of the population of PDR and GQR states are shown separately.  Because the $1^-$ states in the GDR region  are very weakly affected by the coupling to the other states, we left them out of the figure as we want to concentrate on the PDR excitation spectrum.  The GDR excitation dominates  in  the high energy region by a factor of $2-3$ times that of the 2$^+$ states. The main modifications in the excitation spectrum comes from the couplings ${\\rm PDR} \\longleftrightarrow {\\rm GQR} \\longleftrightarrow {\\rm PDR}$ by E1 fields, while the couplings ${\\rm PDR}  \\longleftrightarrow {\\rm GDR}  \\longleftrightarrow  {\\rm PDR}$ by E2 fields contribute very little to the 1$^-$ states in the PDR energy region. We also see in Figure \\ref{cc1} that the tails of the PDR, and to a minor extent those of the GQR, are appreciably modified. A small shift of the peaks also occurs, although barely visible for the PDR, it is evident for the GQR. \n\nIn Figure \\ref{cc2} we singled out the energy region of the pygmy resonance and we plot the results of our calculations for two different bombarding energies: 100 MeV/nucleon and 2 GeV/nucleon, with the same notation as in Figure \\ref{cc1}. The coupling effects change dramatically. At the lower energy the influence of the giant resonances is to increase appreciably the response in the energy region of the PDR, while at the higher energy the effect of coupling is much smaller and the tendency is to slightly decrease the PDR excitation cross section. This result is expected because at  energies around 100 MeV/nucleon the E2 field is dominant, with an appreciable increase of  the excitation of the GQR and a consequently strong feedback to the PDR via subsequent E1 transitions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.38]{CS.pdf}\n\\caption{Coulomb excitation cross sections of the PDR as a function of the bombarding energy of   $^{68}$Ni projectiles incident on $^{197}$Au targets.

The filled circles represent the calculations using first-order perturbation theory, while the filled squares are the results of coupled-channel calculations. At lower energies the deviation is clearly more pronounced. At 600 MeV/nucleon the cross section for excitation of the PDR changes from 80.9 mb obtained with the virtual photon method to 92.2 mb with the coupled-channels calculation. If this is reflected in the extracted PDR strength from the experimental data, it amounts to an appreciable change of 14\\%. It implies a reduction by approximately the same amount of the strength needed to reproduce the experimental data.  \n\nWe have also performed calculations for  $^{68}{\\rm Ni}+^{208}{\\rm Pb}$ at 503 MeV/nucleon, corresponding to the experiment of Ref. \\cite{Ros13}. The Coulomb excitation cross section for the PDR in $^{58}$Ni to first-order is  found to be 57.1 mb, while when couplings to the giant resonances are included, the cross section increases to 61.4 mb, i.e., a rather small but still important 7.5\\% correction.
