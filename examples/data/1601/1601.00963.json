Research has also shown that both variance\nand autocorrelation of time series voltage data tend to increase as\na power system approaches a critical transition. This paper presents\nevidence suggesting that a system's participation factors predict\nthe relative bus voltage variance values for all nodes in a system.\nAs a result, these participation factors can be used to combine PMU\ndata from various locations dispersed throughout a power network into\na single, coherent measure of global stability. This paper first describes\nthe method of computing the participation factors. Next, two methods\nfor using these factors in conjunction with dynamic time series data\nare presented. The method is tested using a dynamic model of a 2383-bus\ntest case. Results from these tests indicate that system wide cross-correlation\nand system wide weighted variance ratios can both be effective early\nwarning signs of a looming transition.\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{IEEEkeywords}\nPower system stability, phasor measurement units, time series analysis,\nstochastic processes, autocorrelation, cross-correlation, critical\nslowing down, modal analysis.\n\\end{IEEEkeywords}\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nAs a result of the Arizona and Southern California Blackout of September\n8, 2011, over 2.7 million customers lost power for a period of up\nto 12 hours. In the incident\\textquoteright s official report \\cite{FERCStaff2012},\ntwo sources were cited as the causes of the failure: inadequate operations\nplanning and poor situational awareness. A high level of situational\nawareness is primarily achieved through constant monitoring of a system's\n(a) contingency resilience and (b) dynamic stability. Because power\nsystems are frequently operated close to critical or bifurcation points\n(in order to optimize limited infrastructure), estimating the proximity\nto voltage collapse is an essential tool grid operators could use\nto gauge dynamic stability.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that as a dynamical system approaches\na bifurcation, early warning signs (EWSs) of the looming transition\nappear in the statistical properties of the system's time series data.\nThis fact has been evidenced in many complex systems, including ecological\nnetworks, financial markets, the human brain, and power systems \\cite{Scheffer:2012,Ghanavati2014}.\nResearchers have even found that human depression onset can be predicted\nby these same statistical properties \\cite{VandeLeemput2014}. In\nthe statistical physics literature this phenomenon is known as Critical\nSlowing Down (CSD) \\cite{Wissel:1984}. When stressed, systems experiencing\nCSD require longer periods to recover from stochastic perturbations.\nSpecifically, CSD is evidenced as state variable signals begin to\nshow increased variance, autocorrelation, and cross-correlation statistics\n\\cite{Scheffer:2012}. \n\nReal power systems are burdened with highly stochastic loads and an\nincreasing level of renewable energy penetration. Consequently, researchers\nhave begun to quantify the presence of CSD in large scale power system\nnetworks. Voltage collapse in such a system can be understood as a\ncritial transition (via Saddle Node bifurcation) \\cite{Dobson1992}.\nWhen close to such a transition, reference \\cite{Cotilla2012} has\nquantified increases in variance and autocorrelation in bus voltage.\nSimilarly, reference \\cite{podolsky2013} computes the power system\nstate vector auto-correlation function to gauge collapse probability.\nFinally, variance and autocorrelation are measured in an unstable\npower system in \\cite{Ghanavati2014} across many state variables.\nThe results indicate that variance of bus voltages and autocorrelation\nof line currents show the most useful signals of CSD. Current angles,\nvoltage angles, generator rotor angles, and generator speeds did not\nyield strong CSD signs capable of indicating proximity to a bifurcation. \n\nAlthough typically a useful indicator, not all variables in a complex\nsystem exhibit CSD sufficiently early enough to be useful early warning\nsigns \\cite{Boerlijst2013}. For instance, reference \\cite{Ghanavati2014}\ndestabilized a simulated power system by over stressing all load buses.\nSignals were then collected from many nodes in this system, and certain\nnodes conclusively did not show early and strong CSD warning signs.\nIn order to mitigate this problem, we employ power flow matrix modal\nanalysis to determine which variables will show the strongest CSD\nindicators. By understanding which variables are the best dynamic\ninstability indicators, we can make stability assessments which are\nhighly representative of the entire system.\n\nWhen performing power flow calculations, the presence of voltage collapse\nresults in the Newton Raphson AC Power Flow equations failing to converge\nto a solution. Reference \\cite{Gao1992} shows that when the eigenvalues\nof the reduced power flow matrix are positive, the system is voltage\nstable. Formally, voltage stability implies that, for each bus in\nthe the system, if reactive power is injected into a bus, voltage\nmagnitude increases. If the system reaches a voltage collapse, the\nreduced power flow matrix becomes singular and at least one eigenvalue\nis driven to zero. Therefore, the eigenvalues can be a useful indicator\nof proximity to instability, but more importantly, through spectral\ndecomposition of this matrix, the eigenvectors can be used to pinpoint\nhow strongly voltages at different nodes contribute to the most unstable\nmodes of system operation.\n\nThrough a combination of modal analysis and CSD theory, this paper\nseeks to identify and evaluate new statistical early warning signs\nof voltage instability. This is accomplished by weighting and filtering\nreal time dynamic data (bus voltages) with participation factors derived\nfrom the decomposition of a static matrix composed of algebraic equations.\nSection \\ref{sec:Method} of this paper outlines the mathematical\nmethods for forming and decomposing the reduced power flow Jacobian\nalong with calculating system wide cross-correlation increases and\nCSD induced variance changes. Section \\ref{sec: Experimental_Results}\nillustrates these methods by presenting simulated results from the\n2383-bus Polish system. Finally, our conclusions are presented in\nSection \\ref{sec: Conclusions}.\n\n\n\\section{Mathematical Methods for Modal Analysis and CSD Statistical Calculations\\label{sec:Method}}\n\nThis section presents a method for using a spectral decomposition\nof the reduced power flow Jacobian to identify and weight variables\nthat will most clearly show evidence of CSD. (Further information\non this spectral decomposition method can be found in \\cite{Gao1992}).\nUsing this analysis, unstable modes can be identified in the system,\nand participation factors can pinpoint exactly which nodes are the\nmost unstable. Next, the participation factors are used to divide\nthe system into two groups and system wide bus voltage cross-correlation\nis examined. Finally, we introduce a stability metric which is based\non comparing the variance increases of the most unstable nodes to\nthe variance increases of the rest of the system.\n\n\n\\subsection{Reduced Power Flow Matrix Construction and Decomposition\\label{sub: Modal Analysis}}\n\nThe standard power flow Jacobian matrix, based on the linearization\nof steady state power system equations, is given by:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta P\\\\\n\\Delta Q\n\\end{array}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nJ_{P\\theta} & J_{PV}\\\\\nJ_{Q\\theta} & J_{QV}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta\\theta\\\\\n\\Delta V\n\\end{array}\\right]\\label{eq: PF_Jacob}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\begin{array}[]{c}\\Delta P\\\\&#10;\\Delta Q\\end{array}=\\left[\\begin{array}[]{cc}J_{P\\theta}&amp;J_{PV}\\\\&#10;J_{Q\\theta}&amp;J_{QV}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}[]{c}\\Delta\\theta\\\\&#10;\\Delta V\\end{array}\\right]\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mtable displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>P</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>Q</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mtable columnspacing=\"5pt\" displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><msub><mi>J</mi><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></msub></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><msub><mi>J</mi><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></msub></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><msub><mi>J</mi><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></msub></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><msub><mi>J</mi><mrow><mi>Q</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></msub></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>]</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mtable displaystyle=\"true\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"center\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00963.tex", "nexttext": "\n\n\nAssuming the system is voltage stable, the matrix $J_{R}$ can be\nassumed non singular and written as the product of its right eigenvector\nmatrix $\\xi$, its left eigenvector matrix $\\eta$, and its diagonal\neigenvalue matrix $\\Lambda$, such that:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 8613, "prevtext": "\n\n\nIn order to perform V-Q sensitivity analysis (an important aspect\nof voltage stability analysis), we assume that the incremental change\nin real power $\\Delta P$ is equal to 0.

For a\nsequence of $T+1$ bus voltage magnitude measurements, at each time\nstep $t$, the mean of the voltage signal ($\\mu_{V_{k}}$) is subtracted,\nand the residual voltage is weighted by that node's participation\nfactor and summed with all of the other weighted residual voltages.\nTwo aggregate vectors are computed:\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\underline{X_{1}}(t)=\\stackrel[k=1]{N}{\\sum}(V_{k}(t)-\\mu_{V_{k}})P_{ki}\\quad\\forall t\\in(0,T)\\label{eq: X1}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\underline{X_{1}}(t)=\\stackrel{[}{k}=1]{N}{\\sum}(V_{k}(t)-\\mu_{V_{k}})P_{ki}%&#10;\\quad\\forall t\\in(0,T)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><munder accentunder=\"true\"><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>\u00af</mo></munder><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mover><mi>k</mi><mo maxsize=\"142%\" minsize=\"142%\">[</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo><mi>N</mi><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mi>P</mi><msub><mi/><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mo>\u2200</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00963.tex", "nexttext": "\nFinally, 0 lag cross-correlation can be computed between $\\underline{X_{1}}(t)$\nand $\\underline{X_{2}}(t)$:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 14881, "prevtext": "\n\n", "index": 13, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\underline{X_{2}}(t)=\\stackrel[k=N+1]{K}{\\sum}(V_{k}(t)-\\mu_{V_{k}})P_{ki}\\quad\\forall t\\in(0,T)\\label{eq: X2}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E7.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\underline{X_{2}}(t)=\\stackrel{[}{k}=N+1]{K}{\\sum}(V_{k}(t)-\\mu_{V_{k}})P_{ki}%&#10;\\quad\\forall t\\in(0,T)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><munder accentunder=\"true\"><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u00af</mo></munder><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mover><mi>k</mi><mo maxsize=\"142%\" minsize=\"142%\">[</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mi>N</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo><mi>K</mi><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\u03bc</mi><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mi>P</mi><msub><mi/><mrow><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo mathvariant=\"italic\" separator=\"true\">\u2003</mo><mo>\u2200</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>\u2208</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00963.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are the signals' mean and standard deviation.\nAs system load increases, it will be shown that, in a sufficiently\nlarge system, the cross-correlation between two such vectors constantly\nincreases as it approaches the upper limit of unity.\n\n\n\\subsection{Using Variance Ratios as an EWS\\label{sub: Variance}}\n\nCSD theory also predicts that the variance ($\\sigma^{2}$) of signals\nwill begin to increase as the system approaches a critical event \\cite{Ghanavati2014}.\nNot all variables will show an extreme increase in variance, and not\nall increases will be sufficiently early to serve as an effective\nEWS.

The\nincrease, though, begins to grow sufficiently early (well before bifurcation),\nmaking it a useful EWS. In total, the variance ratio increases only\nby a factor of 3.4. Comparatively, the variance in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Bus_466_Var}\nincreases by a factor of over 200.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth,height=0.27\\textheight,keepaspectratio]{Var_Ratio_Plot}\n\n\\protect\\caption{\\label{fig:Var_Ratio}The ratio of the sum of weighted voltage variances\nfor two groups of buses is plotted against load factor values.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions\\label{sec: Conclusions}}\n\nThis paper presents evidence that participation factors from a spectral\ndecomposition of the power flow Jacobian can be used to design methods\nfor combining sychrophasor measurements to produce system-wide indicators\nof instability in power systems. This method uses model-based information\nfrom the power flow Jacobian, which can be updated every few minutes\nthrough the SCADA network, along with high sample-rate voltage magnitude\nmeasurements, which can be collected from synchronized phasor measurement\nsystems deployed throughout the system. This combination of power\nflow results and dynamic real time data is used to develop two different\nglobal stability metrics. In particular, we find that the cross-correlation\nof combined weighted voltage measurements is a particularly useful\nearly warning sign of proximity to instability. When the correlation\nof these signals approaches unity, bifurcation is near. System wide\nweighted variance ratios are also shown to be an effective EWS. Because\nthese variance ratios begin to increase far from the bifurcation point,\ngrid operators would have ample time to respond to these signals and\ntake appropriate mitigating actions, such as to re-dispatch generation\nor (as a last resort) reduce demand.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}\n\\bibliography{PES_Paper}\n\n\n\n\\section*{Author biographies}\n\n\\vphantom{}\n\n\\begin{spacing}{0.9}\n\\noindent \\textbf{\\small{}Samuel C.
