For a given metallicity, it is straightforward to calculate the\nrate for various events from our binary evolution grids. We use\nsimple, standard assumptions about the initial binary parameters: we\nassume that (1) the orbital period distribution is flat in $\\log P$\nand covers the range ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{d}-1\\,\\mathrm{yr}$), (2) the\nprimary mass distribution is described by a Salpeter power law\n($dN/d\\log M\\propto M_1^{-1.35}$), (3) the mass-ratio distribution is\nflat, (4) stars more massive than $8\\,M_\\odot$ produce a core-collapse\nSN, and (5) that there is one binary system for every 3~core-collapse\nSNe {(i.e. two out of three massive stars are formed in close binaries)}.\n\nGuided by the results from our grids, we require that the initial mass-ratio has to be larger than 0.8 to ensure chemically homogeneous\nevolution for both stars. With these assumptions we can calculate the fraction of systems that produce BH+BH mergers relative to the\ncore-collapse SN rate. These are shown in the first two rows in Table~\\ref{table:rates} for various metallicities for BH+BH mergers\nbelow and above the PISN gap. These number imply that for, $Z<Z_\\odot/10$, there is typically one BH+BH merger event for $\\sim 1000$ core-collapse SNe. \nTo relate these numbers to a rate for a MWEG, we need to multiply these fractions by the core-collapse rate for a MWEG. \nAdopting a typical rate of 0.01\\,yr$^{-1}$, this implies, e.g., that in a MWEG with $Z=Z_\\odot/50$, the BH+BH merger rates are\n$6.7\\,{\\rm Myr}^{-1}$ and $2.7\\,{\\rm Myr}^{-1}$ below and above the PISN gap, respectively. Note that our model only predicts BH+BH\nmergers above the PISN gap at the lowest metallicity.\n\n\\subsection{Accounting for the star-forming history and the galactic metallicity distribution throughout the Universe}\\label{subsubsec:mapping}\n\nThe actual aLIGO detection rate depends on two main factors: \n(1) the detection volume within which a particular event can be detected, and\n(2) the cosmological distribution of the sources which depends on the star formation history and the chemical evolution of the Universe.\nThe detection volume can be estimated using Eq.~\\ref{eq:Ngal} where $d_{\\rm horizon}$ depends on the aLIGO sensitivity and the BH masses. \nHowever, Eq.~\\ref{eq:Ngal} is only a good approximation for $d_{\\rm horizon}{\\mathrel{\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{\\lower4pt\\hbox{$\\sim$}}}\\hbox{$<$}}}} 1\\,$Gpc as it ignores cosmological expansion. \nTo take this into account (in a very approximate way), we introduce a simple cut-off of $N_{\\rm gal}=10^{10}$ in Eq.~\\ref{eq:Ngal}. \nFor reference, this implies that our simple model assumes that there are about 3 core-collapse SNe per second in the Universe. \nScaling the horizon distance of the BH+BH masses produced in our grids to the design sensitivity of aLIGO, we start by calculating the aLIGO \ndetection rate assuming that all galaxies have a particular metallicity. These rates are shown in the last two rows of Table~\\ref{table:rates},\nin columns 2--5.\n\nOne of the main problems is that our rates are a strong function of metallicity and therefore depend on the evolution of metallicity with\ntime and the spread of the metallicity distribution at a given redshift. For example, the mean metallicity of galaxies will only be\nless than $Z_\\odot/50$ at redshifts larger than $5-7$ (A.~Fruchter; private communication). On the other hand, even in the local Universe\nthere are some galaxies (mostly dwarf galaxies) with extremely low metallicities. A proper calculation of this is beyond the scope of\nthis paper. However, we can derive lower and upper limits using a local and a global approximation to the metallicity distribution.\n\nFor the former, we follow \\cite{LangerNorman06} who computed the formation rate of stars with a metallicity below a threshold\nmetallicity $Z^{\\ast}$ in the local universe. For their fiducial parameters, they found fractions compared to the local total star\nformation rate of 0.61, 0.01, 0.0025, and 0.0004 for the four metallicities used in our binary evolution models \n(${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/4$; ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/10$; ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/20$; and ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/50$; respectively). If the merger delay times were negligible (which they are not; see below), \nand the detection volume were restricted to the low-redshift Universe -- which, from the point of view of the statistics mentioned above \nremains roughly true for redshifts up to $2\\sim3$ -- the above factors would need to be applied to obtain local detection rates for the various\nmetal-poor sources.\n\nA global upper limit to the rates can be obtained by considering the metallicity distribution of all massive stars that have ever formed \nin the Universe. Using the global metallicity distribution provided to us by C.~Kobayashi (based on the simulations presented in \\citealt{Taylor15}),\nwe estimate the fraction of massive stars that have formed with metallicities of ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/10$, ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/20$ and ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/50$ as 0.086, 0.052 and 0.068, \nrespectively (using appropriate linear binning).\n\n\\subsection{Resulting predictions for aLIGO detection rates}\n\nUsing these metallicity weightings, we can estimate ranges for the\naLIGO detection rates (at the design sensitivity) of $19-550\\,{\\rm\n  yr}^{-1}$ for BH+BH mergers below the PISN gap and of $2.1-370\\,{\\rm\n  yr}^{-1}$ above the PISN gap, cf. last column in\nTable~\\ref{table:rates}. Here, the first quoted number of the ranges\ncorresponds to the local approximation, the second one to the global\napproximation.  Even for the ongoing first science run (O1) of aLIGO\nthe prospects for detection should be promising. Given that the\nsensitivity of aLIGO is currently about 1/3 of the design sensitivity,\nthe expected detection rate is $\\sim\\!4\\,\\%$ of our calculated values\n(see last column of Table~\\ref{table:rates}).\n\nAs the lower-mass BH+BH mergers are more likely to sample the\nlow-redshift Universe, the lower limit may be more applicable for the\nmergers below the PISN gap. On the other hand, as the most massive\nBH+BH mergers can be detected throughout most of the visible Universe,\nthe upper limit may be more appropriate for the mergers above the PISN\ngap. Note that for those, the redshift factor $1/(1+z)$ has not yet\nbeen taken into account, as we did not compute the redshift\ndistribution of events.  In any case, even our lower limits suggest\nthat aLIGO should detect BH+BH mergers from the MOB scenario. In fact,\nthe most massive mergers, which probe a large fraction of\nthe whole Universe, could well be the dominant source for aLIGO\ndetections {\\citep{FlanaganHughes1998,Abadie10}}.\n\nAnother factor that helps the detection of BH+BH mergers from\nlow-metallicity populations, that is not taken into account in the\nabove estimates, is that, because of the possibly long merger delay\ntimes (see Figure~\\ref{fig:delay}), even systems which were formed in the early Universe may merge at low redshift (cf.,\n\\citealt{MandelMink16}).\n\nA remaining caveat of concern for our estimated detection rates is\nrelated to the relatively low gravitational-wave frequencies of the\nmore massive BH+BH binaries. The emitted frequencies during in-spiral\nare expected to peak approximately at the innermost stable circular\norbit (ISCO) before the plunge-in phase and the actual\nmerging. However, even determining the ISCO for a merging binary\nsystem is non-trivial and depends, for example, on the spins of the\nBHs \\citep{balmelli+damour2015}, which requires numerical or\nsophisticated (semi-)analytical calculations within general relativity\nand cannot simply be estimated using a test particle in a Kerr field.\nFor the BH+BH mergers above the PISN gap, the emitted frequencies are\nmost likely $\\le 100\\,{\\rm Hz}$, and with redshift corrections the\nfrequencies to be detected are easily smaller by a factor of two or\nmore. Such a low frequency is close to the (seismic noise) edge of the\ndetection window of aLIGO. However, the waveform amplitudes of the\nmore massive BH+BH binaries are larger (for a given distance) and are\nalso enlarged further by a factor of $(1+z)$.  Finally, it may be\npossible that higher frequency signals from the ringdown of the\nsingle, rapidly spinning BH produced could be detectable, despite\ntheir expected smaller wave amplitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important question to address is whether the first generation of\nLIGO should have detected such massive BH+BH merger events. Given that\nthe sensitivity of the first generation of LIGO was about 10 times\nlower, the number of detections should have been 1000 times lower.\nTherefore even for our upper limits, it is not surprising that there\nhave been no detections during the previous science runs of the first\ngeneration LIGO detectors \\citep{Abadie12}.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n\t\\center\n\t\\caption{Fraction of systems per SN that result in double BHs that would merge in less than $13.8\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$ (upper 2 rows),\n\t\tand aLIGO detection rates (lower 2 rows), assuming that all galaxies have the corresponding metallicity (columns 2--5)\n\t\tor are distributed according to our applied integrated metallicity distributions (last column `Integrated Z').\n                Here, the first number of the quoted range corresponds to our local approximation, the second one to the\n                global approximation, which form lower and upper limits (see text).\n\t\tNumbers are given for merging BH+BH binaries both below and above the PISN gap.\n\t\tThe uncertainties in aLIGO detections rates are mainly caused by mapping the galactic metallicity distribution \n\t\t\n\t\tthroughout the Universe (Sect.~\\ref{subsubsec:mapping}).}\n\t\\label{table:rates}\n\t\\begin{tabular}{rccccr}\n\t\t\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\t\tMetallicity $\\longrightarrow$            & $Z_{\\odot}/50$      & $Z_{\\odot}/20$      & $Z_{\\odot}/10$      & $Z_{\\odot}/4$       & Integrated Z \\\\\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\t\t$N_{\\rm BHBH}/N_{\\rm SN}$ below PISN gap & $6.7\\times 10^{-4}$ & $1.3\\times 10^{-3}$ & $3.4\\times 10^{-4}$ & 0                   & $(0.69-13)\\times 10^{-5}$ \\\\ \n\t\t$N_{\\rm BHBH}/N_{\\rm SN}$ above PISN gap & $2.7\\times 10^{-4}$ & 0                   & 0                   & 0                   & $(0.011-1.8)\\times 10^{-5}$ \\\\ \n\t\t\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\t\taLIGO rate (yr$^{-1}$) below PISN gap    & 3539                & 5151                & 501                 & 0                   & 19--550 \\\\ \n\t\taLIGO rate (yr$^{-1}$) above PISN gap    & 5431                & 0                   & 0                   & 0                   & 2.1--370 \\\\ \n\t\t\\hline\n\t\t\\noalign{\\smallskip}\n\t\\end{tabular}\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\\vspace{0.7cm}\n\t\\label{table:rates}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\\section{Concluding remarks}\n\\label{sect:finish}\n\nWe emphasize that -- unlike other channels -- the MOB channel for the\nformation of merging BH binaries is quite robust, relying on\nreasonably well understood stellar-evolution physics; the main\nuncertainty is the treatment of the mixing in rapidly rotating stars,\nbut even here we can derive some confidence from the fact that our\nmodels are able to reproduce {observed} local counterparts of various stages in\nthe MOB scenario (see Figure~\\ref{fig:cartoon}), such as HD\\,5980,\nIC10\\,X-1 and NGC\\,300\\,X-1. The MOB channel predicts the formation of\nvery massive compact BH+BH binaries with a BH mass-ratio close to 1 and a\nbimodal BH-mass distribution from BHs formed below and above the\nPISN regime.\n\nThe detection of GWs from BH+BH mergers with LIGO (and potentially\nother current/future GW detectors) will not only start a revolution in\nobservational astronomy, testing general relativity in its highly dynamic strong-field regime, but will also have a major impact on our understanding of very\nmassive stars throughout the Universe, including their fate as\ngamma-ray bursts or pair-instability supernovae.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nPM and NL are grateful to Bill Paxton for his continuous help in\nextending the MESA code to contain all the physics required for this\nproject over the last years.

The initial pre-SN system contains two\n\t\t$50\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ stars in a binary with an orbital period of\n\t\t$2.0\\,{\\rm days}$.

The lower panels show the distributions\n\t\tin orbital period and eccentricity of the post-SN binaries.\n\t\tThe case of a purely symmetric SN (no kick) is marked with a\n\t\tblack dot in all panels.}\n\t\n\t\\label{fig:BHkick}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOnce a tight binary system with two BHs is formed, the\ncontinuous radiation of gravitational waves will give rise to loss of\norbital energy and a resulting shrinkage of the orbit~\\citep{Einstein18}. \nThe timescale until the two binary components\nfinally merge depends on the BH masses, the orbital period and the\neccentricity of the system \\citep{Peters64}.  The initial parameters\nof BH+BH binaries depend not only on the stellar evolution of the\nprogenitor stars, but also on the physics of the BH-formation process\nitself.\n\nThe formation of BHs may be accompanied by a momentum kick, similar in\nnature to those imparted onto newborn NSs \\citep{Janka12}, in\nparticular if the core of the progenitor does not collapse directly to\na BH but in a two-step process \\citep{Brandt95}.  However, whereas\nthe magnitude of such kicks for NSs is fairly well constrained from\npulsar observations \\citep{Hobbs+05}, the magnitude of kicks\nimparted onto a BH during its formation is rather uncertain. So far,\nthe measured masses of observed stellar-mass BHs are all relatively\nsmall: $4-16\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ for all the Galactic sources\n\\citep{McClintock+14}, $\\sim\\!16\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ for M33~X-7\n\\citep{Orosz+07} and $24-33\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ for IC~10~X1\n\\citep{Prestwich+07}. Their inferred BH kicks from observations and\ntheoretical arguments span from basically no kicks\n\\citep{Nelemans+99} to BH kicks of several 100 km/s\n\\citep{Janka13} based on hydrodynamical kicks associated with\nasymmetric mass ejection and subsequent BH acceleration. \n\n\nFor massive stellar-mass BHs, the situation is different since their\nprogenitor stars more likely collapse directly to form a BH without a\nSN explosion, leading to BHs with very low kick velocities.  Thus, a\nbimodality of the BH kick velocity distribution seems possible\n\\citep{Janka13}.  Another, and possibly related, issue is the amount\nof mass loss during BH formation (ejected baryonic mass and rest mass\nenergy carried away by neutrinos) which also affects the orbital\nperiod and the eccentricity of the post-collapse system.\n\nTo quantify the combined effects of mass loss and kicks, we assume in\nthe following example that a $50\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) star \ncollapses to form a BH with a gravitational mass of $40\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$\ni.e. we assume that $10\\,M_\\odot$ of mass is lost by a combination of\nbaryonic mass loss and/or losses through neutrinos from outside \nthe event horizon. A large amount of baryonic mass loss may be expected\nif the progenitor core is rapidly rotating and the collapse is associated\nwith a LGRB and an LGRB supernova.\n\nWe first consider the no-kick case for a circular pre-collapse system\nwith two $50\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ stars and an orbital period of $2.0\\,{\\rm\n\tdays}$.  If there is no mass loss and no kick imparted to the\nnewborn BH, the orbital parameters of the binary system remain\nunchanged, and the system would merge in $550\\,{\\rm Myr}$.  The result of an instantaneous mass loss of\n$10\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ during the BH formation produces a post-collapse\nsystem with an orbital period of 2.52~days and an eccentricity of 0.11\n(and stellar masses of $40\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ and $50\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$,\nrespectively), which will merge in $1180\\,{\\rm Myr}$. If BH formation is accompanied by an\nadditional momentum kick, however, the outcome can change\nsignificantly.\n\nIn Figure~\\ref{fig:BHkick}, we have plotted the dynamical consequences\nfor a surviving binary system, using the same initial parameters as\nbefore, in which a BH is produced with an asymmetric kick velocity and\ninstantaneous mass loss, following the recipe of\n\\cite{Hills83}.  In a BH+BH binary, two kicks may be imparted,\nbut here we restrict our example to just one kick in order to better\nillustrate the principal dynamical effects -- the analysis can easily\nbe generalized to two kicks without changing the main conclusions. We\nperformed 10\\,000 trials, assuming a flat distribution of the BH kick\nmagnitudes between $0-300\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$ and an isotropic (random)\ndistribution of directions.  If a randomly orientated kick of a fixed\nmagnitude of $300\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$ ($600\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$) were\napplied in all cases, it would result in the disruption of about\n7.3~per~cent (43~per~cent) of the cases. Using a flat distribution\nbetween $0-300\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$, only 0.4~per~cent of all systems\nare disrupted.  Thus even for a wide range of assumed BH kick values,\nthe survival rate of BH+BH binaries only changes with less than a\nfactor of two.\n\nMore important for our investigation here is the merger timescale due\nto gravitational-wave radiation.  Figure~\\ref{fig:BHkick} shows that the\neffect of a kick can either widen or shorten the post-collapse orbit.\nHowever, the merger timescale for a binary with given component masses\nis a function of both orbital period and eccentricity. Given that\nsystems which widen more during BH formation (as a consequence of\ninstantaneous effective mass loss and a kick) are also the systems\nattaining the larger eccentricities, the net effect of a kick on the\nresulting merger time is surprising small.  For the case of BH\nformation with no kick, the merger timescale of the resulting binary\nis 1180~Myr.  Using a flat kick distribution between\n$0-300\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$ results in roughly half (47~per~cent) of the\nsurviving systems to merge on a shorter timescale, and the other half\nto merge on a longer timescale (and only 2.5~per~cent exceeding a\nHubble time).\n\nApplying a strong kick of $600\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$ actually causes a\nlarger fraction of surviving systems to merge (67~per~cent) on a shorter\ntimescale ($<1180\\,{\\rm Myr}$) compared to the symmetric case with no\nkick. Therefore, we can safely conclude that although BH kicks may, in\ngeneral, widen a number of systems, the resulting merger timescale\ndistribution will not change one of the main findings of this paper,\nnamely that the LIGO detection rate is likely to be dominated by quite\nmassive BH+BH mergers.\n\n\\section{Comparison to the standard BH+BH formation scenario}\\label{sec:BHstd}\n\nThe standard formation scenario of BH+BH binaries involves a number of\nhighly uncertain aspects of binary interactions\n(Figure~\\ref{fig:BHstd}, {\\citealt{Tauris2006}}). The main uncertainties include, in particular,\nthe treatment of common-envelope (CE) evolution \\citep{Ivanova13}\nand the efficiency of accretion and spin-up from mass transfer.  These\nlead to uncertainties in the expected merger rates of several orders\nof magnitude \\citep{Abadie10}. In contrast, the MOB scenario presented here\nrelies mostly on reasonably well understood physics of the evolution\nof massive stars, although there are still significant uncertainties\nin the treatment of, e.g., stellar winds \\citep{Langer12},\nrotational mixing \\citep{MaederMeynet12} and the BH formation itself\n\\citep{Heger+13,Ugliano+12,PejchaThompsom15}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\columnwidth, angle=0]{fig_vdh_LIGO_BH_std.png}\n\t\\end{center}\n\t\\caption{ Illustration of the binary stellar evolution leading to\n\t\ta BH+BH binary according to the standard scenario.

The problem with such a model is that\nsuch systems would mostly be expected to merge early during their\nevolution when the more massive star evolves off the main sequence,\nexpands and starts to transfer mass to its companion star. Although\nother models have been proposed which evolve without a CE phase,\ne.g. to explain the formation of IC~10~X-1 \\citep{Mink09} and\nM33~X-7 \\citep{Valsecchi+10}, they often require some degree of\nfine-tuning to work and did not follow the evolution to the end to\nproduce a binary with two BHs.\n\nTo avoid this problem, it has been common practice to model the\nformation of BH+BH systems starting from relatively wide systems and\nlet the systems evolve through a CE phase following the high-mass\nX-ray binary (HMXB) phase after the formation of the first BH (see\nFigure~\\ref{fig:BHstd}). There are presently no self-consistent\nhydrodynamical simulations for modelling the spiral-in of BHs inside a\nmassive envelope; in particular, it is unclear whether the BH will\nexperience hypercritical accretion, and under what conditions the\nsystems will merge completely; all of this leads to large\nuncertainties in the number of post-CE systems and their separations\n\\citep{Ivanova13}.\n\nAnother problem that is often ignored is the fact that the fate of a\nmassive star in a binary depends on when it loses its hydrogen-rich\nenvelope. As first pointed out by Brown \\citep{Brown99} and confirmed in later\ncalculations \\citep{Brown01} (see also Petermann, Langer \\& Podsiadlowski;\nin preparation), if a massive star loses its hydrogen-rich envelope before or\nearly during helium core burning, it ends its evolution with a much\nsmaller iron core and is more likely to produce a NS than a\nBH.  This means that the formation of a BH in a close binary\nmay require that its progenitor loses its envelope only after helium\ncore burning.  In order to produce not just one but two BHs,\nthis may require extreme fine-tuning and may even be impossible in the\nstandard scenario in Figure~\\ref{fig:BHstd}. The problem may be avoided\nin the so-called double-core scenario \\citep{Brown95,Dewi06} where the BH\nprogenitors both evolve beyond helium core burning before experiencing a\nCE phase in which the cores of both stars spiral in, producing a close\nbinary of two helium stars that subsequently collapse to form BHs. However, this scenario requires significant fine-tuning since\nthe initial masses of the two stars have to be very close to each\nother ($q_\\mathrm{i}>0.96$), and it may be impossible to produce quite massive BHs as very massive stars tend to avoid mass transfer after helium core burning\n(although at sufficiently low metallicity ($Z{\\mathrel{\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{\\lower4pt\\hbox{$\\sim$}}}\\hbox{$<$}}}} 0.1\\,Z_\\odot$)\nthis may be possible).\n\n\nGiven that all measured stellar-mass BHs in the Milky~Way have masses\nin the range of $4-16\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$, most population-synthesis models\nused for estimating LIGO detection rates were previously \nrestricted to initial progenitor stellar masses up to about\n$100\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$.  The discovery of very massive stars\n\\citep{Crowther10,Hainich+14} in the R136 region of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud with masses up to $300\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$, however,\nsuggests that BH+BH binaries may form with significantly more massive\ncomponents, thus enabling LIGO to detect the merger of such massive\nBH+BH binaries, with chirp masses easily exceeding $30\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$,\nout to long distances (see discussion in section \\ref{sect:rates}).\n\nIt had previously been argued \\citep{Belczynski+14,Rodriguez15}\nthat massive BH+BH binaries to be potentially detected by LIGO can\nonly form via dynamical channels in dense stellar environments. In\nthis letter, we have demonstrated that close binaries in the Galactic\ndisk with very massive stars undergoing chemically homogeneous evolution \n(and which therefore do\nnot expand after leaving the main sequence) can form massive BH+BH\nbinaries that merge within a Hubble time at sufficiently low\nmetallicity.  An important consequence of our scenario is that\nmassive BHs of a given mass can be produced from stars with a lower\nZAMS mass -- especially at low metallicity -- compared to the standard\nBH+BH formation scenario.\n\nSo far, no stellar-mass BH+BH binaries have been discovered anywhere,\nand, in the Milky~Way, there is only one known potential progenitor\nsystem, Cyg~X-3. The nature of the compact component in this system is\nstill uncertain; \\cite{Belczynski13} have\nargued that it contains a $2-4.5\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ BH and a\n$7.5-14.2\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ WR-star, making it a potential progenitor for a\nBH+BH system. However, the final destiny of this system is unclear, and\nit could also become a BH-NS binary or even NS+NS binary (if the\nfirst-formed compact object is a neutron star); it is also possible\nthat the system is disrupted as a result of the explosion of the WR-star.\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 44070, "prevtext": "\n\t\n\\title{A new route towards merging massive black holes} \n\t\n\\author{Pablo Marchant\\inst{1}\\thanks{Email: pablo@astro.uni-bonn.de}\n\\and Norbert Langer\\inst{1} \n\\and Philipp Podsiadlowski\\inst{2,1}\n\\and Thomas M.

Merging double-white-dwarf systems are thought\nto provide one potential channel to produce so called Type\\,Ia\nsupernovae, which are the main producers of iron and through which the\naccelerated expansion of the Universe was discovered.\n\n\nAlso, various double-neutron-star systems have been found, most\nimportantly the Hulse-Taylor system {\\citep{HulseTaylor1975,Weisberg2010}} and more recently the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039\n{\\citep{Burgay2003,Kramer2006}}, whose orbital decay has\nconfirmed Einstein's gravitational-wave prediction immaculately.\nDouble-black-hole binaries have not yet been detected, which is\nobviously difficult since they do not emit electromagnetic radiation.\nHowever, as they are the most massive of the double compact binaries,\ntheir gravitational-wave radiation would be much stronger than that of\nwhite-dwarf or neutron-star systems.\n\nThe evolution of a binary system from the initial stage of two\norbiting main-sequence stars to the double compact binary stage is\nbelieved to require, in most scenarios, at least one so called\ncommon-envelope phase. This is essential as stars tend to expand dramatically after their main-sequence evolution, and as an early merging of\nthe binary is to be avoided, a large orbital separation is required to\naccommodate this. The common-envelope stage is then necessary to\nshrink the system to a compact final configuration. Whereas the\nphysics of this process is not yet well understood \\citep{Ivanova13},\nsome observational constraints exist for low-mass binaries (e.g., \\citealt{Han2003,Zorotovic2011}).\nFor massive binaries, observational evidence is much scarcer, and the\ncommon-envelope process is much less well understood theoretically\n\\citep{Taam2000}.  For double-neutron-star systems, the\nincreased number of observed systems is beginning to provide some\nconstraints {\\citep{Kalogera2004}}.  For double-black-hole systems, however, the\nuncertainties are so large that the predicted rates of black-hole\nbinaries from the common-envelope channel are uncertain by several\norders of magnitude \\citep{Abadie10}.\n\nA completely different route towards double compact binaries\nis explored in this paper, which does not involve a common-envelope phase\nand may work only for very massive stars: it involves the chemically\nhomogeneous evolution of rapidly rotating stars in tidally locked binaries.\n\n\n\nUsually the stabilizing effects of entropy and composition gradients\nprevent the efficient mixing of gas once composition gradients have\nbeen established. However, the more massive a star is, the less this\nis the case due to the increased importance of radiation pressure.\nIt has been found that mixing induced by rapid rotation can, in\nprinciple, keep massive stars chemically homogeneous\nthroughout core hydrogen burning \\citep{Maeder87,Langer92,Heger00}. \nDetailed studies of this type of\nevolution through large grids of stellar models\n\\citep{Yoon05,Woosley06,Brott11,Kohler15,Szecsi15} have shown that \nthis works only at low\nmetallicity where strong angular-momentum loss due to stellar winds\ncan be avoided such that the stars remain fully mixed until core\nhydrogen exhaustion.  Since, in this case, rapidly spinning iron cores\nare produced at the end of the stars' lives, such single-star models\nhave been suggested as progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts\n(LGRBs) \\citep{Woosley06,Yoon06}.\n\nChemically homogeneously evolving stars avoid the strong post-main\nsequence expansion as they do not maintain a massive hydrogen-rich \nenvelope. \\citet{Mink09} therefore suggested that massive\nclose binaries, where rapid rotation and thus chemically homogeneous\nevolution can be enforced through the tidal interaction of\nboth stars, could evolve towards black holes without ever\nencountering contact or mass transfer (see also \\citet{MandelMink16, Song16}).\n\nIn this paper, we explore the evolution of close binaries with\ncomponent masses above $\\sim 20{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ by computing large grids of\ndetailed binary evolution models.  For this purpose, we use the\npublicly available code MESA, which we extended to allow the inclusion\nof contact binaries with mass-ratios close to one (Sect.\\,2). Against\nour initial expectation, we find that contact-free evolution occurs\nonly very rarely.  Instead, when computing the evolution of massive\novercontact binaries (MOBs), we find many systems which avoid merging\nduring core hydrogen burning.\nWe compute the final configurations of these binaries in Sect.\\,3,\nincluding the black-hole masses, separations, and their mass-ratios.\nIn Sect.\\,4 we discuss the predicted black-hole Kerr parameters,\npotential explosive mass loss and momentum kicks, and the connection\nof the MOB scenario with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and\npair-instability supernovae (PISNe).  We discuss event rates and\npotential LIGO detection rates in Sect.\\,5, before giving our\nconclusions in Sect.\\,6.\n\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\\label{sect:methods}\n\nIn this paper, we provide the first detailed binary stellar evolution models\nwhich are followed until the double-black-hole stage.  \nTo obtain those, we apply the\nMESA code \\citep{Paxton15,Paxton13,Paxton11}, which now includes all the physics required\nfor such calculations, in particular, tidal interactions and\ndifferential rotation. We have computed $\\sim 2000$ detailed\nbinary-evolution sequences in 6 model grids for different initial\nmetallicities and mass-ratios, thereby\nachieving a complete coverage of the relevant parameter space.  Our\nmodel calculations include the overcontact phase which occurs in\nthe closest simulated binaries, which\nconstitutes the main channel for providing \nmassive close black-hole binaries.\n\n\\subsection{Physics implemented in MESA and initial parameters}\n\\label{sect:mesa}\n\nTo model the evolution of our systems, we have used the {\\it binary}\nmodule in version r8118 of the MESA code.\\footnote{The necessary input files to reproduce\n\tour results with this MESA version will be provided at \\url{http://mesastar.org/}.}\nOpacities are calculated\nusing CO-enhanced opacity tables from the OPAL project\n\\citep{Iglesias96}, computed using solar-scaled abundances based on\n\\cite{Grevesse96}. Convection is modelled using the standard\nmixing-length theory \\citep{BohmVitense58} with a mixing length\nparameter $\\alpha=1.5$, adopting the Ledoux criterion. Semiconvection\nis modelled according to \\cite{Langer83} with an efficiency\nparameter $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sc}}=1.0$. We include convective core\novershooting during core hydrogen burning following \\cite{Brott11}.\nThe effect of the centrifugal force is implemented as in\n\\cite{Heger00}. Composition- and angular-momentum transport due to\nrotation includes the effects of Eddington-Sweet circulation, secular\nand dynamical shear instabilities and the GSF instability, with an\nefficiency factor $f_c=1/30$. This corresponds to the\ncalibrations of the mixing efficiency in stellar models based on the\nVLT FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars (\\citealt{Brott11}, and references\ntherein).  We include the effect of magnetic fields on the transport\nof angular momentum as in \\cite{Petrovic05}. Tidal effects are\nimplemented as in \\cite{Hurley+02} and \\cite{Detmers08} for the\ncase of stars with a radiative envelope. As we are not interested in\nfollowing the nucleosynthesis in detail, we use the simple networks\nprovided with MESA \\texttt{basic.net} for H and He burning,\n\\texttt{co\\_burn.net} for C and O burning and \\texttt{approx21.net}\nfor later phases.\n\nOur implementation of stellar winds follows that of \\cite{Yoon06},\nwith mass loss rates for hydrogen-rich stars (with a surface helium abundance $Y_\\mathrm{s}<0.4$)\ncomputed as in \\cite{Vink01}, while for hydrogen-poor stars\n($Y_{\\mathrm{s}}>0.7$) we use the recipe of \\cite{Hamann95}\nmultiplied by a factor of one tenths. In the range\n$0.4<Y_{\\mathrm{s}}<0.7$, the rate is interpolated between the two. For\nboth rates we use a metallicity scaling of\n$(Z/Z_\\odot)^{0.85}$. We also include the enhancement of winds through\nrotation as in \\cite{Heger00}, and, when the rotation rate exceeds a\ngiven threshold $\\Omega/\\Omega_\\mathrm{crit}>0.98$, we implicitly compute\nthe mass-loss rate required for the rotation rate to remain\njust below this value.\n\nWhenever one component in the system attempts to overflow its Roche\nlobe, we implicitly compute the mass-transfer rate necessary for it to\nremain just within the Roche volume (computed as in \\citealt{Eggleton83}). The treatment of mass transfer in over-contact systems is\ndescribed in the following section.\n\nWe consider four different metallicities, $Z_\\odot/4$, $Z_\\odot/10$,\n$Z_\\odot/20$ and $Z_\\odot/50$, with $Z_\\odot=0.017$ as in \\cite{Grevesse96},\nand the helium abundance is set in such a way that it\nincreases linearly from its primordial value $Y=0.2477$ \\citep{Peimbert07}\nat $Z=0$ to $Y=0.28$ at $Z=Z_\\odot$. For all metallicities,\nwe compute grids for mass-ratios $q_\\mathrm{i}=M_2/M_1=1$; for $Z_\\odot/50$, we also compute grids at\n$q_\\mathrm{i}=0.9,0.8$. The initial orbital periods are chosen from the range\n($P_{\\rm i}=0.5-3.0$) days, with an interval of $0.1$ days, while the initial\nprimary masses are taken from the range ($\\log\\;M_1/M_\\odot=1.4-2.7$) in\nintervals of $0.1$ dex.\n\n\\subsection{The computation of massive overcontact systems}\n\\label{sect:contact}\n\nVery close binaries may evolve into contact where both binary\ncomponents fill and even overfill their Roche volumes.  The evolution\nduring the over-contact phase differs from a classical common-envelope\nphase as co-rotation can, in principle, be maintained as long as\nmaterial does not overflow the L2 point. This means that a spiral-in\ndue to viscous drag can be avoided, resulting in a stable system\nevolving on a nuclear timescale.\n\nAs a simple approximation to the modelling of over-contact systems with\na 1D code, we consider the photosphere of such an object to lie on a\nRoche equipotential $\\Phi$ and divide it into two distinct volumes for each\nstar, $V_1(\\Phi)$ and $V_2(\\Phi)$, separated by a plane crossing\nthrough $L_1$ perpendicular to the line joining both stars. We then\nassociate a volume-equivalent radius to each of these, $R_1(\\Phi)$ and\n$R_2(\\Phi)$, with the radii corresponding to the potential at $L_1$\nas the Roche-lobe radius $R_{\\mathrm{RL}}$ of each.  When both\nstars overfill their Roche-lobes, the amount of overflow of one\ncomponent is a function of the mass-ratio, and the amount of overflow\nof the other component, i.e.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{R_2(\\Phi)-R_{\\mathrm{RL},2}}{R_\\mathrm{RL,2}}=\nF\\left(q,\\frac{R_1(\\Phi)-R_{\\mathrm{RL},1}}{R_\\mathrm{RL,1}}\\right),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the function $F(q,x)$ must satisfy the conditions $F(q,0)=0$ and\n$F(1,x)=x$. By numerically integrating $V_1(\\Phi)$ and $V_2(\\Phi)$ for\ndifferent $q$ ratios and potential values between those at $L_1$ and\n$L_2$, we find the fit $F(q,x)=q^{-0.52}x$, with the Roche-lobe radius\ncomputed as in \\cite{Eggleton83}, that approximates $F(q,x)$ with a few percent error\nin the range $0.1\\le q\\le 1$. During an over-contact phase,\nmass transfer is then adjusted in such a way that the amount of\noverflow from each component satisfies this relationship.\n\nOnce both stars overflow past the outer Lagrangian point, we expect\nthe system to merge rapidly, either due to mass loss from $L_2$\ncarrying a high specific angular momentum or due to a spiral-in due\nto the loss of co-rotation. We find that, given the volume equivalent radii\nfor the potential at the L2 point $R_{\\mathrm{L2},i}$, the amount of overflow of the\nleast massive star in a system that reaches $L_2$ approximately satisfies\nthe relationship\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{L2},2}-R_{\\mathrm{RL},2}}{R_\\mathrm{RL,2}}=0.299\\;\\tan^{-1}(1.84q^{0.397})\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwith an error smaller than $2\\%$ in the range $0.02\\le q\\le1$. At\n$q=1$ this means that a star needs to expand up to $1.32$ times its\nRoche-lobe radius before reaching L2, leaving a significant amount of\nspace for a binary to survive through an over-contact phase.  Note\nthat, for the moment, we ignore the effects of energy and element\ntransfer through the shared envelope. However, since the systems we\nmodel in this work undergo contact as rather unevolved stars with mass\nratios not far from one, we expect these effects to be of minor\nimportance for our present study.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that VFTS352 is a massive ($\\sim\n30{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}+30{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$), short-period ($P_{\\rm orb}=1.12$\\,d) over-contact\nbinary, evolving on the nuclear timescale, which has a mass-ratio of\n$q=1.008$ and is thought to undergo chemically homogeneous evolution\n\\citep{Almeida15}.  This system therefore provides direct support for\nthe MOB scenario and for our treatment of this phase.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sect:results}\n\nBefore looking at the wider parameter space, we provide an example\nof a typical MOB evolution in the following section.\n\n\\subsection{Exemplary MOB evolution}\n\\label{sect:examplestar}\n\nWe show in Fig.\\ref{fig:spiral} the evolutionary tracks of both\ncomponents of a $79+64{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ binary at $Z={\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/50$ with an initial\nperiod of 1.1\\,d, from the zero-age main sequence until core helium\nexhaustion. This system enters an overcontact phase early during core\nhydrogen burning, during which it swaps mass back and forth several\ntimes. Each time, the mass-ratio becomes closer to one, such that\neventually contact is avoided and the system evolves as a detached\nbinary with two stars of about $71{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ furtheron.\n\nCore hydrogen burning ends at an effective temperature of  \n$\\log T_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 4.9$, after which both stars contract to even smaller radii.\nDue to the different initial evolution, both stars do not evolve exactly\nsynchronously during the late evolutionary stages. \n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:cartoon} illustrates the different evolutionary stages \nof a typical binary in our grid from the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) to the black-hole\nmerger stage.  While chemically homogeneous evolution is maintained during all of core hydrogen\nburning, again, mass is transferred back and forth\nbetween the two binary components in a succession of contact stages,\nwhich eventually leads to a mass-ratio very close to one.  During the\nmain-sequence phase and the post-core-hydrogen-burning phase, where\nboth stars are compact detached helium stars, stellar-wind mass loss\nleads to a widening of the orbit. As the winds are metallicity\ndependent \\citep{Mokiem07,Vink05}, metal-rich systems are found to\nwiden strongly, which limits the tidal interaction such that the homogeneous evolution\nmay end. Furthermore, if the orbital period is too long, any BH+BH\nbinary that may be produced will not merge in a Hubble time.\nThe depicted case corresponds to case with a metallicity of $Z={\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/20$,\nwhich provides a black hole merger after 2.6\\,Gyr. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\hsize]{HR_spiral.pdf}\n        \\end{center}\n        \\caption{Evolutionary tracks of both stars in\n                a MOB in the HR diagram.

Since the initial binary periods have\nto be very short in order to enforce the rapid rotation required for\nhomogeneous evolution, the final properties lie in a narrow strip for\neach metallicity, but these are distinctly different for different\nmetallicities. For the highest considered masses, \nthis is mainly due to the metallicity dependence of the\nstellar wind mass loss which has the effect of widening the systems and reducing\nthe mass of the stars, thus producing systems with longer orbital\nperiods and lower masses at higher metallicity. \n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:MP}\nalso indicates the merger times for these systems, assuming that the\nmasses and periods do not change in the black-hole formation process\n(cf., Sect.\\,\\ref{sect:kick}). All models with ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot} /4$ and all but\nthe lowest-mass ones with ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot} /10$ produce binaries which are too\nwide to lead to black-hole mergers within a Hubble time.  \nThe more metal-poor models, on\nthe other hand, produce very tight He-star binaries below as well as\nabove the mass regime where pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are\nexpected to lead to the complete disruption of the stars rather than\nthe formation of black holes \\citep{Heger02,Chatzopoulos12}.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\hsize]{mass_period.pdf}\n        \\end{center}\n        \\caption{\nTotal masses and {orbital} periods at core helium depletion for systems with $q_\\mathrm{i}=1$ at four\ndifferent metallicities. Dashed lines are for constant merger times assuming\ndirect collapse into a black hole, and the shaded region indicates the mass\nrange at which PISNe would occur, resulting in the total disruption of the stars\ninstead of black-hole formation. The colored bands represent for each\nmetallicity the relative number of objects formed.\n                \n                \\label{fig:MP}\n        }\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe trend of shorter merger times for lower metallicities is expected to continue\ntowards the lowest metallicities found in the Universe. As stellar wind mass loss\nbecomes more and more negligible, the initial stellar radii determine the smallest\npossible orbital periods. As an example, stars of $60{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ have ZAMS radii of\n$12{\\,{\\rm R}_\\odot}$, $10.5{\\,{\\rm R}_\\odot}$, $10{\\,{\\rm R}_\\odot}$, and $3.5{\\,{\\rm R}_\\odot}$, at $Z={\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}$, ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/10$, ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/50$\nand $Z=0$, respectively. This implies that the merger times for the lowest metallicities,\nin particular for Population\\,III stars, become extremely short. While the expected number\nof such objects is small, this opens the exciting possibility of eventually observing primordial\nblack hole mergers at high redshift.\n\n\\subsection{Mass distribution and mass-ratios}\n\\label{sect:masses}\n\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:chirp} shows the predicted intrinsic chirp-mass\ndistribution for BH+BH mergers for our different metallicity grids,\nagain assuming no mass loss in the BH-formation process.  The most\nprominent feature is the prediction of a clear gap in this\ndistribution, which occurs because systems which would otherwise\npopulate this gap do not appear since the stars explode as\npair-instability supernovae without leaving a stellar remnant. The BH\nprogenitors in the systems above the gap also become pair unstable,\nbut the explosive burning can not reverse the collapse which leads\nstraight to the formation of a black hole \\citep{Heger02,Langer12}.\n\nThere is a\nstrong general trend towards higher chirp masses with decreasing\nmetallicity. At the lowest metallicity ($Z=Z_\\odot/50$) we \nproduce also BHs above the PISN gap. While obviously their number is\nsmaller than the number of BH systems below the gap, they may still be\nsignificant as the amplitude of the gravitational-wave signal\nis a strong function of the chirp mass (cf. Sect.\\,\\ref{sect:rates}).\n\nAs indicated in Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:chirp}, the vast\nmajority of merging systems have passed through a contact phase. Since both stars are relatively\nunevolved when they undergo contact, these contact phases result in\nmass transfer back and forth until a mass-ratio $q\\simeq 1$ is\nachieved. This is depicted in Figure \\ref{fig:mratios}, where final\nmass-ratios are shown for systems with $q_\\mathrm{i}=0.9,0.8$ and $Z=Z_\\odot/50$. For each mass-ratio,\ntwo distinct branches are visible, corresponding to systems that\nundergo contact and evolve to $q\\simeq 1$, and systems that avoid\ncontact altogether. Owing to the strong dependence of mass-loss rates\nwith mass, at high masses, even systems that avoid contact altogether\nevolve towards $q=1$. \n\n{\\cite{MandelMink16} model this channel without including contact systems \nand find an important number of binaries forming double BHs from progenitors \nbelow the PISN gap, with final mass-ratios in the range of 0.6 to 1,\nreflecting just a small shift from the initial mass-ratio distribution\ndue to mass loss. \nHowever, \\cite{MandelMink16} do not perform detailed stellar evolution calculations.\nThey check whether their binary components underfill their Roche-radii at the ZAMS,\nand then assume that this will remain so in the course of the quasi-homogeneous evolution\nof both stars. When considered in detail, however, in particular the more massive and\nmore metal-rich stars undergo some expansion during core hydrogen burning, even on the\nquasi-homogeneous path \\citep{Brott11,Kohler15,Szecsi15}, likely due to the increase\nof their luminosity-to-mass-ratio and the related approach to the Eddington limit\n\\citep{Sanyal2015}. As a result, the vast majority of the binaries\nconsidered by \\cite{MandelMink16} enter contact when computed in detail. Therefore,\nour final mass-ratio distribution is much more strongly biased towards $q=1$.\n} \n\n\\begin{figure}\n        \\begin{center}\n\n                \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\hsize]{merger_chirpmass.pdf}\n        \\end{center}\n        \\caption{{Stacked} distribution of chirp masses of BH+BH\n                systems formed at different metallicities, such that\n                they merge in less than $13.8\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$.

Fig.~\\ref{fig:delay} shows the distribution of the merger\ndelay times for the different metallicities in our grids (assuming a\nuniform metallicity distribution). While the typical delay time is\nseveral Gyr, which helps detecting these events at lower redshift (see\nSect.~\\ref{sect:rates}), at the lowest metallicity, the delay time can\nbe as short as $0.4$\\,Gyr for BH+BH mergers below the PISN\ngap. \n\n{The decrease in delay times with smaller metallicity is not found in the\nmodels of \\citet{MandelMink16}, who conclude that  no high-redshift mergers are expected. \nThe reason is that they consider effectively only\none metallicity, namely the threshold metallicity for chemically homogeneous\nevolution by \\citet{Yoon06} of $Z=0.004$. However, the components of\nlower-metallicity binaries are more compact, allowing tighter binaries\nat zero age, and have weaker winds, which produces tighter double-black-hole binaries.\nTherefore, while \\citet{MandelMink16} predict delay times to be larger than\n3.5\\,Gyr, we find up to 10-times smaller values at our lowest metallicity\n(Figure \\ref{fig:delay}). Since the minimum delay time depends on the metallicity-dependent\nstellar radii, and stellar radii of massive metal-free stars are less than half\ncompared to those at ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/50$ \\citep{Yoon2012,Szecsi15},\neven orders of magnitude shorter merger times can be expected. Therefore, even though \nmuch rarer, we argue that massive BH mergers could occur up to the redshift of\nPopulation~III stars.} If such mergers were detected, it would allow us to probe\nthe evolution of massive stars in the very early Universe.\n\nWe also note that, if the black holes receive kicks at birth,\neven higher-metallicity systems may merge very rapidly if the kick\nreduces the pericenter distance (see Appendix ~\\ref{sec:BHkick}).\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\hsize]{tmerge_dist.pdf}\n\t\\end{center}\n\\caption{{Stacked} distribution of merger delay times for different metallicities\n\t(as indicated). The meaning of the hatching is as in Figure \\ref{fig:chirp}}\\label{fig:delay}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Observational counterparts}\n\\label{sect:obs}\n\nOur choice to include models of up to 500${\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ in our grids is\nsupported by the evidence for stars of such high masses in the LMC\n\\citep{Crowther10}.  \n\nVarious evolutionary stages of the MOB scenario are\nobservationally confirmed by massive binary systems in nearby\ngalaxies. As mentioned in Sect.\\,2, the MOB VFTS352 \n\\citep{Almeida15} supports the idea of\nhomogeneous evolution of overcontact binaries, even though it is not expected\nto lead to a black-hole merger due to the rather high metallicity\nof the LMC (cf., Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:MP}). It corresponds to\nthe first stage of our cartoon in Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:cartoon}.\n\nThe SMC binary HD\\,5980 corresponds well to the second stage of\nFig.\\,\\ref{fig:cartoon}. It consists of two $\\sim 60\\,{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ stars\nwhich are both very hydrogen-poor, in a $\\sim$19\\,d orbit.\n\\citet{Koenigsberger14} concluded that this system most likely emerged\nfrom homogeneous evolution. This system is well recovered in our grid\nat ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/10$.\n\nFinally, IC10\\,X-1\nand NGC\\,300\\,X-1 are binaries which may correspond well to stage~3\nof Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:cartoon}. Both have a short orbital period\n($P_{\\rm orb}\\simeq 1.5$\\,d for both) and contain very massive\nblack-hole primaries ($> 23{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ and $20{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$) and similar-mass,\nhydrogen-free companions ($\\sim 35{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$ and $26{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$;\n\\citet{Barnard08,Bulik11}).  Both systems have close-matching\ncounterparts in our ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}/20$ binary-evolution grids, \n{with life times of up to several 10$^4$\\,yr.}\n\n\\subsection{Spins}\n\\label{sect:spins}\n\nTo test the possibility of producing LGRBs according to the\n``collapsar'' scenario \\citep{Woosley93} from our MOB models, we\ncompare in Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:am} angular-momentum profiles at the point\nof core helium depletion for a few systems that fall below the PISN\ngap. A significant amount of mass ejected during an LGRB event could\nmodify the final orbital periods of double BHs, although we find that\nthis should not play a determining role in our rate estimates (as\ndiscussed further in Sect.~4).\n\nAs Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:am} shows, \nmodels at a metallicity of $Z_\\odot/10$ experience\nsignificant braking due to winds, and thus they are unlikely to\nproduce LGRBs. In contrast, several systems at $Z_\\odot/50$ that\nresult in helium stars below the PISN gap have specific\nangular-momentum profiles above the values for the last stable orbit,\nassuming all mass collapses into a critically rotating black hole.\nThe results at $Z_\\odot/20$ are more ambiguous, and it is not clear\nwhether the stars would produce an LGRB or not. For systems forming\nblack holes above the PISN gap, even for low metallicity wind braking\nis strong enough to avoid the formation of LGRBs.\n\nThis picture is confirmed when considering the Kerr parameters of our models\nin Fig.\\,\\ref{fig:kerr} in the different mass and metallicity regimes.  \n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\hsize]{am.pdf}\n        \\end{center}\n        \\caption{Angular-momentum profiles at core helium depletion for\n                the primary stars of binaries from our grid \n                that result in double-helium-star binaries.

In the $90\\,M_\\odot$ model, the core\ncollapses during oxygen burning, resulting in explosive burning which\ninjects enough energy to halt the collapse and drive an explosion.  At the\nhighest mass, the oxygen core also undergoes collapse, but explosive\nburning is not sufficient to stop it, and in the end burning proceeds\nvery fast up to silicon depletion, resulting in an iron core with an\ninfall velocity $>1000\\,\\mathrm{km\\;s^{-1}}$.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n        \\begin{center}\n                \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\hsize]{rhoT.pdf}\n        \\end{center}\n        \\caption{ The evolution in the $T_c - \\rho_c$-diagram for the\n                three stellar models at $Z=Z_\\odot/50$ (with the masses at helium depletion as indicated)\n                calculated to the final evolutionary stage.

If the whole star collapses without ejecting\nany mass or energy, the masses and periods in Figure~\\ref{fig:MP}\nwould also represent the masses of the final black holes and the\npost-collapse orbital periods. On the other hand, as our helium stars\ntend to be rapidly rotating, some of them may go through a collapsar\nphase \\citep{Woosley93}, producing LGRBs, in which part of the collapsing star is ejected, and the\nbinary orbit may receive a supernova kick. The effect of the mass loss\nwould be to reduce the final black-hole masses (and to reduce the\nstrength of any eventual gravitational-wave signal) and widen the\nsystem (and increase the merger time), while the effect of a kick can\nbe to either increase or decrease the orbital period and the merger\ntime (see Appendix\\,\\ref{sec:BHkick} for a more detailed\ndiscussion). While the details of the collapse phase are still very\nuncertain, which may have an effect on the BH+BH detection\nrates, our main conclusions are not dependent on these. \n\nIn any case,\nthe final angular-momentum profiles of our models\n(see Sect.\\,\\ref{sect:spins}) suggest that only the lowest-mass models\n($M_{\\rm final} {\\mathrel{\\hbox{\\rlap{\\hbox{\\lower4pt\\hbox{$\\sim$}}}\\hbox{$<$}}}} 40{\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot}$) at the two lowest metallicities ($Z={\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot}\n/20$, ${\\,{\\rm Z}_\\odot} /50$) may retain enough angular momentum in the core to be\ngood LGRB candidates. Nevertheless, because of the large amount of\navailable angular momentum, we expect many of the BHs formed in this\nscenario to be rapidly rotating, with the spin parameter\nroughly scaling inversely with the final orbital period shown in\nFig.~\\ref{fig:MP} (i.e.\\ the largest spins are expected for the\nlowest-mass BHs at the lowest metallicity).  Finally, we note that,\nbelow the disruptive PISN regime, there is a regime of pulsational\nPISNe \\citep{Chatzopoulos12}, where substantial mass loss is expected\nbut a BH is nevertheless ultimately formed \\citep{Woosley07}.\n\n\\section{Merger rates}\\label{sect:rates}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{Concerning the conventional scenario to produce close double compact binaries involving common envelope evolution (see Appendix\\,B),} except for a few cases \\citep{VossTauris03,Belczynski+10,Dominik+15}, the far majority of published population synthesis studies predict a much higher NS+NS merger rate per Milky~Way equivalent galaxy (MWEG) compared to the rate of BH+BH mergers. Based on a detailed comparison study of published models \\citep{Abadie10}, the NS+NS merger rate was estimated to be $100\\,{\\rm MWEG}^{-1}\\,{\\rm Myr}^{-1}$, which is about 100 times larger than the rate predicted for BH+BH binaries. However, given the more massive compact objects in BH+BH binaries, compared to those of NS+NS binaries, their emitted gravitational-wave amplitudes are significantly larger {such that the LIGO detection rates of both come out to be approximately equal. The so-called 'realistic' rates\tquoted by \\citet{Abadie10} are 40 and 20$\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ for NS and BH mergers, respectively, but the uncertainty in these numbers is larger than three orders of magnitude.}\n\n\\subsection{Chirp masses and MOB evolution}\nTwo important things should be kept in mind with regard to these\nquoted rates.  First, the BH+BH binaries are assumed to be composed of\n$10\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$~BHs (even $5\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$~BHs in all LIGO result papers\npublished before 2010), corresponding to an intrinsic chirp mass,\n$\\mathcal{M}_0$ of $\\sim\\!8.7\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ (for equal mass binaries,\n$\\mathcal{M}_0=(1/4)^{3/5}\\,M\\simeq 0.435\\,M$, where the total mass,\n$M$ is twice the BH mass, $M_{\\rm BH}$). For low metallicities, our\nMOB scenario predicts formation of BHs with masses of\n$25-60\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and $130-230\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ (i.e. below and above the\nPISN mass range, respectively), resulting in very large intrinsic\nchirp masses of about $20-50\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and $115-200\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$,\nrespectively (cf. Fig.~\\ref{fig:chirp}).  Such mergers can be seen\nthroughout a significant fraction of the Universe, since the distance\nluminosity, $d_L \\propto \\mathcal{M}_0^{5/6}$.  Note, the detected\nchirp masses will be redshifted to $\\mathcal{M}_0\\,(1+z)$, where $z$\nis the BH+BH system's redshift with respect to the detector on Earth\n\\citep{Finn96}.\n\nSecondly, all previously published rates were based on CE-evolution (cf., App.\\,\\ref{sec:BHstd}),\nwhich creates uncertainties in the rates by more than two orders of\nmagnitude as a result of our poor understanding of the CE physics \\citep{Dominik+12}. The new BH+BH formation scenario (MOB evolution) \npresented in this work does not involve any CE phase. Instead, it is based on much less uncertain physics (as discussed in the previous section).\nEqually important, it leads to the formation of much more massive BHs compared to previous studies.\n\nAssuming, as a first approximation, that the detection rate,\n$\\mathcal{R}$, scales with $d_L^{\\;3}\\propto \\mathcal{M}_0^{5/2}$, we\nconclude that the expected LIGO detection rates for these massive\nBH+BH binaries could easily dominate the overall rates; they are\ntherefore excellent candidates for the first LIGO source detection\n(see the more detailed discussion below).  It should be noted that\nsome previous studies \\citep{Belczynski+10,Dominik+15,Rodriguez15}\nhave already alluded to a dominance of relatively massive BH+BH\nmergers in a low-metallicity environment (or, in particular, via\ndynamical channels in dense clusters), although without a specific\ndetailed model for the binary case.\n\nThe expected LIGO detection rate of BH+BH binary mergers has been estimated in the following manner, \n$\\mathcal{R}=r_{\\rm MW}\\times N_{\\rm gal}$, where $r_{\\rm MW}$ is the expected merger rate in a MWEG, and\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nN_{\\rm gal} = \\frac{4}{3}\\,\\pi\\,\\left(\\frac{d_{\\rm horizon}}{{\\rm Mpc}}\\right)^3 \n\\,(2.26)^{-3}\\,(0.0116)\n\\label{eq:Ngal}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"N_{\\rm gal}=\\frac{4}{3}\\,\\pi\\,\\left(\\frac{d_{\\rm horizon}}{{\\rm Mpc}}\\right)^{%&#10;3}\\,(2.26)^{-3}\\,(0.0116)\" display=\"block\"><mrow><msub><mi>N</mi><mi>gal</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>\u03c0</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>d</mi><mi>horizon</mi></msub><mi>Mpc</mi></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mn>3</mn></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>2.26</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>0.0116</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
