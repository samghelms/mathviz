For example, the barrier height for \nnuclear fusion depends on the orientation of colliding nuclei if a deformed\nnucleus is involved \\cite{Reisdorf(1994),Hagino(2012)}. In the synthesis\nof superheavy elements (SHEs), shell effects are crucially important, since\nthey reduce excitation energy of a compound nucleus, and enhancing its\nsurvival probability. A remarkable example is the successful synthesis of\nSHEs by the cold-fusion reactions, where $^{208}$Pb or $^{209}$Bi\ntarget is utilized \\cite{Munzenberg(1988),Hofmann(1998)}. Recently,\nshell effects on multinucleon transfer (MNT) and quasifission (QF)\nprocesses have also been extensively discussed. These reactions are\nexpected to be useful to produce neutron-rich unstable nuclei around\n$N=126$ (see, e.g., Refs.~\\cite{Zagrebaev(2008)1,Kozulin(136Xe+208Pb),\nZagrebaev(2013)IQF,Watanabe(2015),Zagrebaev(2014)light_N-rich,\nZagrebaev(2006),Zagrebaev(2008)2,Feng(2009),DNS(2015),Dasso(1994),\nDasso(1995),Mun(2014),Mun(2015)} and references therein).\n\nThe present study aims to elucidate reaction mechanisms of\nthe MNT and QF processes in nuclear reactions involving a heavy\ndeformed nucleus. Specifically, we focus on $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U\nreaction for which abundant experimental data of both MNT and QF\nprocesses are available. Since this system has a large $N/Z$\nasymmetry [$N/Z=1.29$ ($^{64}$Ni) and 1.59 ($^{238}$U)],\nMNT processes toward the charge equilibrium of the total system\nare expected. A precise measurement of cross sections of the\nMNT processes was carried out by L.~Corradi et~al.~\\cite{Corradi(64Ni+238U)}.\nMoreover, $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction has been expected\nas a possible candidate for synthesizing a SHE with $Z=120$.\nTo examine this possibility, E.M.~Kozulin~et~al.~measured\nfragment mass and total kinetic energy (TKE) distributions at\nseveral incident energies \\cite{Kozulin(64Ni+238U)}. In\nRef.~\\cite{Kozulin(64Ni+238U)}, it was shown that mass-symmetric\nfragments are hardly produced in $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction.\nThis fact indicates a strong suppression of the fusion reaction by\nQF processes. Mass-angle and mass-TKE distributions including\n$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U were reported by J.~T{\\\"o}ke\net~al.~\\cite{Toke(QF1985)}.\n\nTo investigate MNT and QF processes theoretically, various\nmodels have been developed. For MNT reactions, semiclassical\nmodels called {\\mbox{\\small GRAZING }} \\cite{GRAZING,GRAZING-code,GRAZING-online}\nand Complex WKB \\cite{CWKB} have been developed with great\nsuccesses \\cite{Corradi(review)}. The {\\mbox{\\small GRAZING }} has recently\nbeen extended to incorporate transfer-induced fission, which is\nreferred to as {\\small GRAZING-F} \\cite{GRAZING-F}. To describe\ndamped collisions, a dynamical model based on Langevin-type \nequations \\cite{Zagrebaev(2005),Zagrebaev(2007)1,Zagrebaev(2008)1,\nZagrebaev(2013)IQF,Zagrebaev(2014)light_N-rich,Zagrebaev(2006),\nZagrebaev(2008)2,Zagrebaev(2007)2,EXP2015(136Xe+208Pb)},\nthe dinuclear system (DNS) model \\cite{Antonenko(1995),\nAdamian(1997)1,Adamian(1997)2,Adamian(1998),Adamian(2003),\nFeng(2009),Adamian(2010)1,Adamian(2010)2,Adamian(2010)3,\nMun(2014),Mun(2015),DNS(2015)}, and the improved quantum\nmolecular dynamics model (ImQMD) \\cite{ImQMD(2002),ImQMD(2004),\nImQMD(2008),ImQMD(2013),ImQMD(2015)1,ImQMD(2015)2}\nhave been extensively developed. Despite numerous successes\nin describing measurements, they are to some extent empirical,\ncontaining adjustable parameters. This fact limits their predictive\npower. To further extend our understanding of reaction mechanisms\nand to improve reliability to predict cross sections, we apply the\nmicroscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory to\nMNT and QF processes.\n\nThree-dimensional simulations based on the TDHF theory for\nlow-energy nuclear reactions started around 70's. They have\nbeen successful to describe various phenomena such as fusion\nreactions and deep inelastic collisions \\cite{Negele(review),Simenel(review)}.\nApplications of the TDHF theory to MNT and QF processes are\nrather new. In Ref.~\\cite{KS_KY_MNT}, we applied the TDHF\ntheory to investigate MNT processes in $^{40,48}$Ca+$^{124}$Sn,\n$^{40}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb, and $^{58}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb reactions\nat energies near the Coulomb barrier, for which precise experimental\ndata are available \\cite{Corradi(40Ca+124Sn),Corradi(48Ca+124Sn),\nCorradi(58Ni+208Pb),Szilner(40Ca+208Pb)2}. Applying the particle-number\nprojection (PNP) method \\cite{Projection} to the TDHF wave function\nafter collision, we evaluated transfer probabilities and cross sections\nfor each channel specified by the number of neutrons and protons\nin the reaction products. From the comparison with measurements,\nwe showed that the TDHF theory reproduces measured cross sections in\nan accuracy comparable to other existing models. In Ref.~\\cite{KS_KY_PNP},\nwe have extended the PNP method to evaluate expectation values of\noperators. Recently, we applied our method to an asymmetric system,\n$^{18}$O+$^{206}$Pb, at energies above the barrier \\cite{Bidyut(2015)}.\n\nRecently, QF processes have been investigated by the TDHF theory\n\\cite{TDHF(2009)238U-238U,TDHF(2010)IQF,Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay,\nUO(QF2014),MyPhD,Hammerton(2015),Washiyama(2015),UO(QF2015)}.\nFirst, QF dynamics in collisions of two actinide nuclei such as $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U\n\\cite{TDHF(2009)238U-238U} and $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf \\cite{TDHF(2010)IQF}\nwas investigated. In these studies, it has been suggested that QF dynamics\ndepends sensitively on the nuclear orientations, incident energies, and\nimpact parameters. In Ref.~\\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay} in which\nQF processes of $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U were reported, it has been indicated\nthat shell effects reflecting $Z=82$ and $N=126$ magic numbers have\nstrong influence in tip collisions, while no shell effect is seen in side collisions.\nIn that work, it has also been recognized that contact time is much longer\nin side collisions than that in tip collisions. The mass-angle distributions,\nwhich are one of the characteristic observables of QF processes, were\ncalculated and compared with experimental data, showing reasonable\nagreements \\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay,Hammerton(2015)}. \n\nIn this article, we report systematic investigations of MNT and QF\nprocesses in $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Making use of the PNP\nmethod, we are able to make detailed comparisons with measurements,\nincluding cross sections. In the studies reported so far \\cite{TDHF(2009)238U-238U,\nTDHF(2010)IQF,Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay,UO(QF2014),Hammerton(2015),\nWashiyama(2015),UO(QF2015)}, sensitive dependence of QF dynamics\non nuclear structure has been suggested. From our detailed analyses of\nthis system, we expect to elucidate clearly those effects of deformation\nand quantum shells on QF processes.\n\nThe article is organized as follows: In Sec.~\\ref{Sec:method},\nwe briefly explain the theoretical framework of the TDHF theory\nand present computational settings. In Sec.~\\ref{Sec:results},\nwe present the results of our TDHF calculations. In Sec.~\\ref{Sec:Elab390},\nwe investigate $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\nIn Sec.~\\ref{Sec:Edep}, incident energy, impact parameter,\nand orientation dependence of QF dynamics is investigated.\nIn Sec.~\\ref{Sec:comparison}, we compare the TDHF results\nwith measurements. In Sec.~\\ref{Sec:summary}, summary\nand conclusion are presented. A part of the results of the\npresent analyses was reported in Ref.~\\cite{MyPhD}.\n\n\n\\section{METHOD}{\\label{Sec:method}}\n\n\\subsection{TDHF theory}\n\nWe briefly explain our theoretical framework.

In the code, the TDHF equation is solved in real\nspace and real time. Single-particle wave functions are represented\non a three-dimensional uniform grid without any symmetry restrictions.\nThe mesh spacing is set to be 0.8~fm. We employ the 11-point\nfinite-difference formula for spatial derivatives. The fourth-order\nTaylor expansion method is utilized for the time-evolution operator\nwith a single predictor-corrector step. The time step is set to be\n$\\Delta t=0.2$~fm/$c$. Hockney's method \\cite{Hockney}\nis used to calculate the Coulomb potential in the isolated\nboundary condition.\n\nA box with $30 \\times 30 \\times 30$ grid points is used to calculate\nthe ground state of the projectile and target nuclei. A box with\n$70 \\times 70 \\times 30$ grid points is used for reaction calculations.\nWe set the incident direction parallel to the $x$-axis and set the impact\nparameter vector parallel to the $y$-axis. The initial separation distance\nbetween centers of the projectile and the target is set to be 24~fm along\nthe incident direction. We stop TDHF calculations when the distance\nbetween centers of the reaction products reaches 26~fm.\n\nWe use Skyrme SLy5 parameter set \\cite{Chabanat} for the EDF.\nThe ground state of $^{64}$Ni has an oblate shape with $\\beta\n\\sim 0.12$, while that of $^{238}$U has a prolate shape with\n$\\beta \\sim 0.27$. We perform TDHF calculations for three initial\norientations of $^{238}$U: The symmetry axis of $^{238}$U is\nset parallel to the incident direction ($x$-axis), set parallel to the\nimpact parameter vector ($y$-axis), and set perpendicular to the\nreaction plane ($xy$-plane). We call these three cases as $x$-,\n$y\\mbox{-},$ and $z$-direction cases, respectively. Since\ndeformation of $^{64}$Ni is not very large, we always set the\nsymmetry axis of $^{64}$Ni perpendicular to the reaction plane,\nassuming that the reaction is not affected much by the direction\nof the deformed of $^{64}$Ni. Figure~\\ref{FIG:schematic_xyz}\nschematically shows three cases of initial configurations. Since\nnuclear rotational motion is very slow, we assume that the nuclear\norientation at the contact of two nuclei can be well specified by\nthe configurations at the beginning of the TDHF calculations.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=6.3cm]{figure01.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   Three initial configurations used for our TDHF calculations of $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U\n   reaction.

The calculations are performed for an\nimpact parameter range, 0~fm~$\\le b \\le 12$~fm. The incident energy\nof $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV corresponds to about 27~\\% and 16~\\%\nabove the frozen HF barrier for the $x$- and $y$-direction cases,\nrespectively, for $b=0$~fm. In our TDHF calculations at this incident\nenergy, we always found binary reaction products and no fusion reaction\nwas observed even in head-on collisions.\n\nWe will show scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame, $\\theta_\n{\\rm c.m.}$, TKEL, and contact time. The scattering angle and the\nTKEL are evaluated from the translational motion of reaction products\nas described in Ref.~\\cite{KS_KY_MNT}. The contact time is defined\nas the duration in which the lowest density between colliding nuclei\nexceeds a half of the nuclear saturation density, $\\rho_0/2=0.08$~fm$^{-3}$.\nThe same definition was also used by other authors \\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}, we show $\\theta_{\\rm c.m.}$,\nTKEL, and contact time in (a), (b), and (c), respectively, as functions of \nthe impact parameter. Results for $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction cases are\nshown by red circles, green crosses, and blue open triangles connected\nwith dotted lines, respectively. The same symbols will be used in\nFigs.~\\ref{FIG:Nave}, \\ref{FIG:Wilczynski}, \\ref{FIG:MAD}, and \\ref{FIG:TKE-A}.\nIn (a), the scattering angle for the Rutherford trajectory is shown by a dotted\ncurve. In (c), contact time is shown in zeptosecond ($1$~zs~$=10^{-21}$~sec).\n\nWe first investigate behavior which does not depend much on the initial\norientation of $^{238}$U. When the impact parameter is sufficiently large\n($b \\gtrsim 7$~fm), the reaction is governed by the Coulomb interaction,\nand the scattering angle coincides with that of the Rutherford trajectory.\nAt this impact parameter region, TKEL is very small and contact time is\nzero. As the impact parameter decreases ($b \\lesssim$~7~fm), TKEL\nincreases rapidly taking maximum values at $b \\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm.\nSurfaces of two nuclei also start to touch gently, and the nuclear attractive \ninteraction distorts trajectory toward forward angles.\n\nAt a small-$b$ region ($b \\lesssim 5$~fm), the contact time becomes\nsubstantially long. This indicates a formation of a dinuclear system\nconnected by a thick neck. Because the dinuclear system rotates for a \ncertain period, the scattering angle decreases noticeably as shown in (a). \nAs the impact parameter decreases further, the scattering angle increases \nmonotonically, reaching $180^\\circ$ (backward scattering) in head-on\ncollisions. In this small-$b$ region, TKEL is roughly constant.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=6.6cm]{figure02.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\n   Scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame, $\\theta_{\\rm c.m.}$, total kinetic\n   energy loss (TKEL), and contact time are shown in (a), (b), and (c), respectively,\n   as functions of the impact parameter, $b$.

In (a), the scattering angle for the Rutherford\n   trajectory is shown by a dotted curve.\n   }\n   \\label{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe next look at dependence on the orientation of $^{238}$U\nseen in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}. As the impact parameter\ndecreases from $b\\sim 6$~fm, we observe a rapid decrease of the\nscattering angle in (a). Contrary, we observe a rapid increase of the\ncontact time in (c). The decrease (increase) of the scattering angle\n(contact time) is steepest for the $x$-direction case and becomes\nmoderate as the orientation changes from $x$- to $y$- and from\n$y$- to $z$-direction. This difference can be understood as follows.\nIn the $x$-direction case, the symmetry axis of $^{238}$U is set\nparallel to the collision axis (Fig.~\\ref{FIG:schematic_xyz}~(a)).\nIn this geometry, two nuclei collide substantially at a large impact\nparameter, $b \\sim 5$~fm, compared to the other cases. In the\n$z$-direction case, $^{64}$Ni always collides with the side of\n$^{238}$U  (Fig.~\\ref{FIG:schematic_xyz}~(c)). This results\nin the slowest change of $\\theta_{\\rm c.m.}$ and contact time.\nResults of the $y$-direction case (Fig.~\\ref{FIG:schematic_xyz}~(b))\nlocates between those of the $x$- and $z$-direction cases.\n\nThe contact time shown in (c) has a strong orientation\ndependence at a small-$b$ region ($b \\lesssim 4$~fm).\nIn the $y$- and $z$-direction cases, contact time increases\nmonotonically as the impact parameter decreases, reaching\n10--11~zs in head-on collisions. On the other hand, in the\n$x$-direction case, contact time takes almost a constant\nvalue (about 4--5~zs), even decreases slightly as the impact\nparameter decreases. Because of the shorter contact time,\nthe combined dinuclear system does not rotate much. This\nexplains larger scattering angles for the $x$-direction case\ncompared with the other cases at small impact parameters\n($b \\lesssim 3$~fm), seen in (a). The observed orientation \ndependence of the contact time is consistent with the TDHF \ncalculations for $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U reported in\n\\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=17.2cm]{figure03.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   Snapshots of the density in the reaction plane in TDHF calculations for\n   $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\n   Results for two impact parameters, $b=0.5$~fm and 2~fm, and two\n   initial orientations of $^{238}$U, the $x$- and $y$-direction cases,\n   are shown.

At $b=5.5$~fm, we find a formation of a thin neck\nthrough which a few nucleons are exchanged. The reaction dynamics\ndoes not show much difference between the $x$- and $y$-direction\ncases at this impact parameter.\n\nContrarily, we find quite different reaction dynamics at a small-$b$\nreaction, $b=2$~fm, for different orientations of $^{238}$U. Let us\nfirst look at reaction dynamics in the $x$-direction case at\n$b=2$~fm shown in (c). As time evolves, $^{64}$Ni collides with\n$^{238}$U at a position close to the tip of the $^{238}$U ($t=0.67$~zs).\nThen a thick and long neck is developed in the course of the collision,\nforming an elongated dinuclear system ($t=0.67$--2.67~zs). After\nthis stage, the neck becomes thinner ($t=3.33$--4~zs) and eventually\nruptures ($t=4.77$~zs), producing binary reaction products ($t=5.34$~zs).\nThe produced fragments roughly correspond to $_{40}^{100}$Zr$_{60}^{}$\nand $_{80}^{202}$Hg$_{122}^{}$. We note that we find very similar\nshape evolution dynamics to that shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:rho(t)}~(c) in\na wide impact parameter range of $b=0 \\mbox{--}4$~fm, where the contact\ntime was almost constant as shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}~(c).\n\nFigure~\\ref{FIG:rho(t)}~(d) shows reaction dynamics in the $y$-direction\ncase at $b=2$~fm. In this case, $^{64}$Ni collides with $^{238}$U at\na position close to the side of the $^{238}$U ($t=0.67$~zs). After the\ntouch, a somewhat compact composite system with a thick neck structure\nis formed ($t=2$~zs) (Note that the time of each snapshot is not the same\nas that shown in (c)). The dinuclear system with a thick neck structure is\nmaintained for a long period and rotates in the reaction plane ($t=2\n\\mbox{--}6.67$~zs). When the neck ruptures ($t=8.89$~zs), fragments\nwith more symmetric masses are generated compared with those of the\n$x$-direction case shown in (c). The produced fragments roughly correspond\nto $_{47}^{116}$Ag$_{69}^{}$ and $_{73}^{185}$Ta$_{112}^{}$.\n\nWe next investigate average numbers of nucleons in the reaction\nproducts as functions of the impact parameter. Figure~\\ref{FIG:Nave}~(a)\nand (b) show average numbers of neutrons and protons in the lighter\nfragment, which we denote as $N_{\\rm L}$ and $Z_{\\rm L}$, respectively.\nThose in the heavier fragment, which we denote as $N_{\\rm H}$ and\n$Z_{\\rm H}$, are shown in (c) and (d), respectively. $N/Z$ ratios of\nthe lighter and the heavier fragments are also shown in (e). In (e),\nthe fully equilibrated value of the system, 1.52, is indicated by\na horizontal dotted line. \n\nWhen the impact parameter is sufficiently large ($b \\gtrsim7$~fm),\nthe average numbers of neutrons and protons coincide with those\nof the projectile and target nuclei. As the impact parameter decreases\n($b\\sim 5\\mbox{--}6$~fm), we find that protons are transferred\nfrom $^{64}$Ni to $^{238}$U, while neutrons tend to be transferred\nin the opposite direction. These directions of transfers correspond\nto those expected form the initial $N/Z$ asymmetry. We show a\nmagnified plot for this impact parameter range as insets in (a-d).\nThe snapshots of the density shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:rho(t)}~(a,~b)\ncorrespond to reactions in this impact parameter range.\n\nAs the impact parameter decreases further, we find a drastic change\nat around $b\\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm. Inside this impact parameter,\na mass equilibration process toward the direction increasing the\nmass symmetry, which we call the mass-drift mode, is observed.\nIn the mass-drift mode, both neutrons and protons are transferred\ntoward the same direction, from the heavier nucleus to the lighter one.\nWhile the fragment masses show substantial changes at $b\\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm,\nthe $N/Z$ ratios approach monotonically to the fully equilibrated value.\nFrom the density profile during the reaction, we find that the shape evolution \nand the neck rupture are responsible for the mass-drift mode. Once\na dinuclear system is formed in the course of collision, the system\nquickly reaches the charge equilibrium, and the position of the neck\nrupture determines the amount of transfers of neutrons and protons.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{KS_KY_MNT}, we reported similar transfer dynamics\nin lighter systems.\n\nThe mass-drift mode observed at $b \\lesssim 5$~fm shows noticeable\ndependence on the initial orientation. In the $z$-direction case (blue open\ntriangles), we find a gradual change of the average number of nucleons.\nIn contrast, in the $x$- and $y$-direction cases, we observe an abrupt\nchange at $b \\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm. In the $x$-direction case\n(red open circles), the average number of nucleons exhibits a prominent\nplateau which persists within 0~fm~$\\le b \\lesssim 4$~fm. In this\nimpact parameter region, $N_{\\rm H} \\sim 120\\mbox{--}126$ and\n$Z_{\\rm H}\\sim 78\\mbox{--}82$ are observed. We consider that\nthe quantum shells of $^{208}$Pb make a significant contribution\nto this behavior. A similar shell effect of $^{208}$Pb has also been\nreported in the tip collisions of $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U in TDHF\ncalculations \\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}. We note that, in our\ncalculations, the lighter partner has $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 55\\mbox{--}60$\nand $Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 37\\mbox{--}42$. A production of similar fragments\nhas also been observed in TDHF calculations for the side collisions\nof $^{40,48}$Ca+$^{238}$U at $b=0$~fm \\cite{UO(QF2014)}.\nA possible influence of stabilization by strongly bound Zr isotopes\nwith large prolate deformation in this mass region has been\nadvocated \\cite{UO(QF2014)}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{figure04.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\n   Average numbers of nucleons in lighter (a,~b) and heavier (c,~d) fragments\n   are shown as functions of the impact parameter, $b$.

As in the $x$-direction case, we observe an abrupt change\nof the average number of nucleons at $b \\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm.\nHowever, the plateau around $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 126$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\n\\sim 82$ does not appear. The composite system tends to split into\nmore mass-symmetric fragments. It indicates that the quantum shells\nof $^{208}$Pb are not significant in this case. A similar interplay\nbetween the quantum shells and the nuclear orientation was reported\nin $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U \\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}, it was reported that quantum\nshells do not contribute in the side collisions of $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U.\nContrarily to it, we find another plateau behavior in the $y$- and\n$z$-direction cases. In the $y$-direction case, at a small-$b$ region,\n0~fm~$\\lesssim b \\lesssim 2$~fm, we observe a plateau at around\n$N_{\\rm H}\\sim 110$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\\sim 72$ for the heavier\nfragment and $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 70$ and $Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 48$ for\nthe lighter fragment. This behavior may be influenced by the shell\neffect of $Z=50$ in the QF process. In the $z$-direction case,\na plateau is seen at around $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 127$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\n\\sim 83$ for the heavier fragment and $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 54$ and\n$Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 37$ for the lighter fragment. This behavior indicate\nthe effect of quantum shells around $^{208}$Pb. We note that\ninfluence of quantum shells in QF processes has been routinely\nobserved experimentally \\cite{Itkis(2004),Nishio(36S+238U),\nNishio(34S+238U),Nishio(4048Ca+238U),Kozulin(2014)1,\nKozulin(2014)IOP,Kozulin(2014)2} and discussed theoretically\n\\cite{Zagrebaev(2005),Zagrebaev(2007)1,Zagrebaev(2013)IQF,\nZagrebaev(2006),Zagrebaev(2007)2,Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay,\nAritomo(2004),Aritomo(2005),Aritomo(2009),Aritomo(2012)}.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that, in the $y$-direction case, the average\nnumber of nucleons changes dramatically when the impact parameter\nbecomes a tiny but a finite value. For instance, from $b=0$ to 0.25~fm,\nthe average number of nucleons changes as large as 25. We consider\nthat the observed behavior is related to the symmetry that appears\nonly at $b=0$ fm in which the colliding system has a rotational symmetry\naround the collision axis. This symmetry disappears once the impact\nparameter becomes finite.\n\nWe note that the behavior at around $b=0$ fm is different\nbetween $y$- and $z$-direction cases. To understand the\norigin of the difference, let us consider reaction dynamics\nviewed from a frame rotating with the vector connecting\ncenters of the two colliding nuclei, ${\\bf R}(t)$. In the\n$z$-direction case, it is recognized that the reaction can be\ncharacterized by the distance between two nuclei irrespective\nof the impact parameter. The system always persists a reflection\nsymmetry with respect to the plane which contains ${\\bf R}(t)$\nand is perpendicular to the reaction plane. On the other hand,\nin the $y$-direction case at a nonzero impact parameter, the\nsystem does not have the symmetry mentioned above due\nto the deformed shape of $^{238}$U. Thus the system may\ngo through more complex shape evolution dynamics. In fact,\nonce the impact parameter becomes nonzero in the $y$-direction\ncase, we find the projectile-like subsystem moving along the\nelongated direction of the $^{238}$U-like subsystem forming\na very thick neck, which results in the abrupt change of the\naverage number of transferred nucleons.\n\nThe orientation dependence is also clearly seen in the TKEL at\na small-$b$ region ($b \\lesssim 4$~fm) in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}~(b).\nIn the $y$- and $z$-direction cases, TKEL takes almost constant\nvalues, $\\sim 70\\mbox{--}80$~MeV. We observe somewhat larger\nvalues of TKEL in the $y$-direction case compared with those of the\n$z$-direction case. This difference may reflect the reflection symmetry\nmentioned above which restricts reaction dynamics in the $z$-direction case.\nIn the $x$-direction case, we observe smaller values, $\\sim 50\\mbox{--}60$~MeV.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{Guillaume(2015)258Fm}, fission dynamics of $^{258}$Fm\nwas investigated by TDHF+BCS approach. It was shown that the TKE\nexhibits clear dependence on the shape of the fissioning nucleus,\nand that the different shape evolution dynamics is associated with\ndifferent valleys in the potential energy surface (PES). Although\nwe have not conducted PES calculations of $_{120}^{302}$Ubn$_{182}^{}$\ncomposite system, we expect that there exists a valley in the PES\nof the composite system associated with the doubly magic $^{208}$Pb\nand that the valley causes the small TKEL and the small contact time.\n\nWe note that an experimentally measured TKE distribution of \n$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at a smaller incident energy, \n$E_{\\rm c.m.}\\sim 282.13$~MeV, was reported \\cite{Kozulin(64Ni+238U)}. \nIn the measurement, a two-peaked structure of TKE was observed. \nAlthough the plot was constructed from selected fragments having\n$A_{\\rm CN}/2 \\pm 20$, it is expected that different dynamics \nassociated with the large deformation of $^{238}$U affects the\nmeasured trends.\n\n\n\\subsection{Incident energy dependence}{\\label{Sec:Edep}}\n\nIn this Subsection, we examine incident energy dependence of QF\nprocesses in $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. We investigate reactions\nat two impact parameters, $b=0.5$~fm and 2~fm, for two orientations\nof $^{238}$U, $x$- and $y$-direction cases.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{figure05.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $b=0.5$ and 2~fm\n   for $x$- and $y$-direction cases.

Those in the\nheavier fragment are shown in (c) and (d). In (e), contact time is also\npresented. The horizontal axis is the center-of-mass energy, $E_{\\rm c.m.}$.\n\nFirst, we consider the $x$-direction case (open symbols). As\nthe center-of-mass energy increases, we find an abrupt change\nin the fragment masses when the energy exceeds the barrier height,\n$V_{\\rm B}\\sim 242.93$~MeV. Just above the barrier, the fragment\nmasses are about $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 58$ and $Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 40$\nand $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 124$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\\sim 80$ for both\n$b=0.5$- and 2-fm cases.\n\nFor $b=2$~fm case (red open circles), the fragment masses are\nalmost independent of the center-of-mass energy for an energy\nrange, 290~MeV~$\\lesssim E_{\\rm c.m.}\\lesssim$~500~MeV.\nIt indicates a significant influence of the quantum shells around\n$^{208}$Pb, even above barrier energies. On the other hand,\nfor $b=0.5$~fm case (green open squares), the amount of\ntransferred nucleons decreases as the center-of-mass energy\nincreases. This behavior implies that the shell effect is weakened\nas the incident energy increases. We consider that the difference\nbetween $b=0.5$- and 2-fm cases originates from the different\nexcitation energies. In the $x$-direction case, an elongated dinuclear\nsystem is formed as seen in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:Nave_vs_E}~(e).\nNo fusion reaction was observed for whole incident energies\nexamined here in the $x$-direction case.\n\nNext, we consider the $y$-direction case (filled symbols).\nFor both $b=0.5$- and 2-fm cases, we observed similar behavior\nas a function of the center-of-mass energy. As in the $x$-direction\ncase, we find an abrupt change in the fragment masses when the\ncenter-of-mass energy exceeds the barrier height, $V_{\\rm B}\\sim\n263.97$~MeV. In contrast to the $x$-direction case, the fragment\nmasses continue to change as the center-of-mass energy increases, \nup to $E_{\\rm c.m.}\\sim 300$ (350)~MeV for $b=0.5$ (2)~fm.\nWe also find an abrupt change in the contact time, as shown in (e).\nIn the $y$-direction case, the composite system shows a compact\nshape, which becomes a mononuclear shape as the center-of-mass\nenergy increases.\n\nWe note that, in the $y$-direction case at higher center-of-mass\nenergies, $E_{\\rm c.m.}\\gtrsim 300$ (350)~MeV for $b=0.5$ (2)~fm,\na capture process takes place, forming a superheavy composite system with\n$Z=120$. We continued time-evolution calculations up to about $13$~zs\n(20,000 time steps). In this period, the composite system exhibits a\ncompact mononuclear shape. In Ref.~\\cite{Kozulin(64Ni+238U)},\nmeasured fragment mass distributions in $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U\nreaction were reported at several incident energies. They showed\nthat mass-symmetric fragments are hardly produced in the reaction. \nOur results are consistent with the experimental observation, since\nthe highest incident energy of the experiment was $E_{\\rm c.m.}\n\\sim 301.05$~MeV, and is much smaller than the present\nthreshold energy for fusion in our TDHF calculations. Our results\nindicate that more mass-symmetric fragments will be produced\nafter forming a mononuclear system at higher incident energies,\nalthough it should accompany substantial excitation energy.\n\n\n\\section{Comparison with measurements}{\\label{Sec:comparison}}\n\n\\subsection{Production cross sections}\\label{Sec:NTCS}\n\nTo compare with measured cross sections of MNT processes,\nwe employ the PNP method \\cite{Projection,KS_KY_MNT,KS_KY_PNP}.\nWe use the PNP operator,\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 11431, "prevtext": "\nwhere ${\\bf r}$ and $\\sigma$ are spatial and spin coordinates,\nrespectively. $q$ ($=n$ or $p$) denotes the isospin of $i$-th nucleon.\nSingle-particle wave functions, $\\psi_i({\\bf r}\\sigma q,t)$ ($i=1,\\cdots,A$),\nsatisfy the orthonormal relation, $\\sum_\\sigma\\int \\psi_i^*({\\bf r}\\sigma q,t)\n\\psi_j({\\bf r}\\sigma q,t)\\,d{\\bf r}=\\delta_{ij}$.

We call these three cases as $x$-,\n$y\\mbox{-},$ and $z$-direction cases, respectively. Since\ndeformation of $^{64}$Ni is not very large, we always set the\nsymmetry axis of $^{64}$Ni perpendicular to the reaction plane,\nassuming that the reaction is not affected much by the direction\nof the deformed of $^{64}$Ni.

The incident energy\nof $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV corresponds to about 27~\\% and 16~\\%\nabove the frozen HF barrier for the $x$- and $y$-direction cases,\nrespectively, for $b=0$~fm. In our TDHF calculations at this incident\nenergy, we always found binary reaction products and no fusion reaction\nwas observed even in head-on collisions.\n\nWe will show scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame, $\\theta_\n{\\rm c.m.}$, TKEL, and contact time. The scattering angle and the\nTKEL are evaluated from the translational motion of reaction products\nas described in Ref.~\\cite{KS_KY_MNT}. The contact time is defined\nas the duration in which the lowest density between colliding nuclei\nexceeds a half of the nuclear saturation density, $\\rho_0/2=0.08$~fm$^{-3}$.\nThe same definition was also used by other authors \\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}, we show $\\theta_{\\rm c.m.}$,\nTKEL, and contact time in (a), (b), and (c), respectively, as functions of \nthe impact parameter. Results for $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction cases are\nshown by red circles, green crosses, and blue open triangles connected\nwith dotted lines, respectively. The same symbols will be used in\nFigs.~\\ref{FIG:Nave}, \\ref{FIG:Wilczynski}, \\ref{FIG:MAD}, and \\ref{FIG:TKE-A}.\nIn (a), the scattering angle for the Rutherford trajectory is shown by a dotted\ncurve. In (c), contact time is shown in zeptosecond ($1$~zs~$=10^{-21}$~sec).\n\nWe first investigate behavior which does not depend much on the initial\norientation of $^{238}$U. When the impact parameter is sufficiently large\n($b \\gtrsim 7$~fm), the reaction is governed by the Coulomb interaction,\nand the scattering angle coincides with that of the Rutherford trajectory.\nAt this impact parameter region, TKEL is very small and contact time is\nzero. As the impact parameter decreases ($b \\lesssim$~7~fm), TKEL\nincreases rapidly taking maximum values at $b \\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm.\nSurfaces of two nuclei also start to touch gently, and the nuclear attractive \ninteraction distorts trajectory toward forward angles.\n\nAt a small-$b$ region ($b \\lesssim 5$~fm), the contact time becomes\nsubstantially long. This indicates a formation of a dinuclear system\nconnected by a thick neck. Because the dinuclear system rotates for a \ncertain period, the scattering angle decreases noticeably as shown in (a). \nAs the impact parameter decreases further, the scattering angle increases \nmonotonically, reaching $180^\\circ$ (backward scattering) in head-on\ncollisions. In this small-$b$ region, TKEL is roughly constant.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=6.6cm]{figure02.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\n   Scattering angle in the center-of-mass frame, $\\theta_{\\rm c.m.}$, total kinetic\n   energy loss (TKEL), and contact time are shown in (a), (b), and (c), respectively,\n   as functions of the impact parameter, $b$. Results for $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction\n   cases are shown by red circles, green crosses, and blue open triangles connected\n   with dotted lines, respectively. In (a), the scattering angle for the Rutherford\n   trajectory is shown by a dotted curve.\n   }\n   \\label{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nWe next look at dependence on the orientation of $^{238}$U\nseen in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}. As the impact parameter\ndecreases from $b\\sim 6$~fm, we observe a rapid decrease of the\nscattering angle in (a). Contrary, we observe a rapid increase of the\ncontact time in (c). The decrease (increase) of the scattering angle\n(contact time) is steepest for the $x$-direction case and becomes\nmoderate as the orientation changes from $x$- to $y$- and from\n$y$- to $z$-direction. This difference can be understood as follows.\nIn the $x$-direction case, the symmetry axis of $^{238}$U is set\nparallel to the collision axis (Fig.~\\ref{FIG:schematic_xyz}~(a)).\nIn this geometry, two nuclei collide substantially at a large impact\nparameter, $b \\sim 5$~fm, compared to the other cases. In the\n$z$-direction case, $^{64}$Ni always collides with the side of\n$^{238}$U  (Fig.~\\ref{FIG:schematic_xyz}~(c)). This results\nin the slowest change of $\\theta_{\\rm c.m.}$ and contact time.\nResults of the $y$-direction case (Fig.~\\ref{FIG:schematic_xyz}~(b))\nlocates between those of the $x$- and $z$-direction cases.\n\nThe contact time shown in (c) has a strong orientation\ndependence at a small-$b$ region ($b \\lesssim 4$~fm).\nIn the $y$- and $z$-direction cases, contact time increases\nmonotonically as the impact parameter decreases, reaching\n10--11~zs in head-on collisions. On the other hand, in the\n$x$-direction case, contact time takes almost a constant\nvalue (about 4--5~zs), even decreases slightly as the impact\nparameter decreases. Because of the shorter contact time,\nthe combined dinuclear system does not rotate much. This\nexplains larger scattering angles for the $x$-direction case\ncompared with the other cases at small impact parameters\n($b \\lesssim 3$~fm), seen in (a). The observed orientation \ndependence of the contact time is consistent with the TDHF \ncalculations for $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U reported in\n\\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=17.2cm]{figure03.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   Snapshots of the density in the reaction plane in TDHF calculations for\n   $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\n   Results for two impact parameters, $b=0.5$~fm and 2~fm, and two\n   initial orientations of $^{238}$U, the $x$- and $y$-direction cases,\n   are shown. Elapsed time measured from the initial configuration is\n   indicated in each panel in zeptosecond ($1$~zs~$=10^{-21}$~sec).\n   }\n   \\label{FIG:rho(t)}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\nTo obtain intuitive understanding of the reaction dynamics,\nwe show in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:rho(t)}~(a-d) snapshots of the density\nin the reaction plane for two impact parameters, 5.5~fm and 2~fm,\nand two orientations of $^{238}$U, the $x$- and $y$-direction cases.\nElapsed time measured from the initial configuration is indicated in\nzeptosecond. At $b=5.5$~fm, we find a formation of a thin neck\nthrough which a few nucleons are exchanged. The reaction dynamics\ndoes not show much difference between the $x$- and $y$-direction\ncases at this impact parameter.\n\nContrarily, we find quite different reaction dynamics at a small-$b$\nreaction, $b=2$~fm, for different orientations of $^{238}$U. Let us\nfirst look at reaction dynamics in the $x$-direction case at\n$b=2$~fm shown in (c). As time evolves, $^{64}$Ni collides with\n$^{238}$U at a position close to the tip of the $^{238}$U ($t=0.67$~zs).\nThen a thick and long neck is developed in the course of the collision,\nforming an elongated dinuclear system ($t=0.67$--2.67~zs). After\nthis stage, the neck becomes thinner ($t=3.33$--4~zs) and eventually\nruptures ($t=4.77$~zs), producing binary reaction products ($t=5.34$~zs).\nThe produced fragments roughly correspond to $_{40}^{100}$Zr$_{60}^{}$\nand $_{80}^{202}$Hg$_{122}^{}$. We note that we find very similar\nshape evolution dynamics to that shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:rho(t)}~(c) in\na wide impact parameter range of $b=0 \\mbox{--}4$~fm, where the contact\ntime was almost constant as shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}~(c).\n\nFigure~\\ref{FIG:rho(t)}~(d) shows reaction dynamics in the $y$-direction\ncase at $b=2$~fm. In this case, $^{64}$Ni collides with $^{238}$U at\na position close to the side of the $^{238}$U ($t=0.67$~zs). After the\ntouch, a somewhat compact composite system with a thick neck structure\nis formed ($t=2$~zs) (Note that the time of each snapshot is not the same\nas that shown in (c)). The dinuclear system with a thick neck structure is\nmaintained for a long period and rotates in the reaction plane ($t=2\n\\mbox{--}6.67$~zs). When the neck ruptures ($t=8.89$~zs), fragments\nwith more symmetric masses are generated compared with those of the\n$x$-direction case shown in (c). The produced fragments roughly correspond\nto $_{47}^{116}$Ag$_{69}^{}$ and $_{73}^{185}$Ta$_{112}^{}$.\n\nWe next investigate average numbers of nucleons in the reaction\nproducts as functions of the impact parameter. Figure~\\ref{FIG:Nave}~(a)\nand (b) show average numbers of neutrons and protons in the lighter\nfragment, which we denote as $N_{\\rm L}$ and $Z_{\\rm L}$, respectively.\nThose in the heavier fragment, which we denote as $N_{\\rm H}$ and\n$Z_{\\rm H}$, are shown in (c) and (d), respectively. $N/Z$ ratios of\nthe lighter and the heavier fragments are also shown in (e). In (e),\nthe fully equilibrated value of the system, 1.52, is indicated by\na horizontal dotted line. \n\nWhen the impact parameter is sufficiently large ($b \\gtrsim7$~fm),\nthe average numbers of neutrons and protons coincide with those\nof the projectile and target nuclei. As the impact parameter decreases\n($b\\sim 5\\mbox{--}6$~fm), we find that protons are transferred\nfrom $^{64}$Ni to $^{238}$U, while neutrons tend to be transferred\nin the opposite direction. These directions of transfers correspond\nto those expected form the initial $N/Z$ asymmetry. We show a\nmagnified plot for this impact parameter range as insets in (a-d).\nThe snapshots of the density shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:rho(t)}~(a,~b)\ncorrespond to reactions in this impact parameter range.\n\nAs the impact parameter decreases further, we find a drastic change\nat around $b\\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm. Inside this impact parameter,\na mass equilibration process toward the direction increasing the\nmass symmetry, which we call the mass-drift mode, is observed.\nIn the mass-drift mode, both neutrons and protons are transferred\ntoward the same direction, from the heavier nucleus to the lighter one.\nWhile the fragment masses show substantial changes at $b\\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm,\nthe $N/Z$ ratios approach monotonically to the fully equilibrated value.\nFrom the density profile during the reaction, we find that the shape evolution \nand the neck rupture are responsible for the mass-drift mode. Once\na dinuclear system is formed in the course of collision, the system\nquickly reaches the charge equilibrium, and the position of the neck\nrupture determines the amount of transfers of neutrons and protons.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{KS_KY_MNT}, we reported similar transfer dynamics\nin lighter systems.\n\nThe mass-drift mode observed at $b \\lesssim 5$~fm shows noticeable\ndependence on the initial orientation. In the $z$-direction case (blue open\ntriangles), we find a gradual change of the average number of nucleons.\nIn contrast, in the $x$- and $y$-direction cases, we observe an abrupt\nchange at $b \\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm. In the $x$-direction case\n(red open circles), the average number of nucleons exhibits a prominent\nplateau which persists within 0~fm~$\\le b \\lesssim 4$~fm. In this\nimpact parameter region, $N_{\\rm H} \\sim 120\\mbox{--}126$ and\n$Z_{\\rm H}\\sim 78\\mbox{--}82$ are observed. We consider that\nthe quantum shells of $^{208}$Pb make a significant contribution\nto this behavior. A similar shell effect of $^{208}$Pb has also been\nreported in the tip collisions of $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U in TDHF\ncalculations \\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}. We note that, in our\ncalculations, the lighter partner has $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 55\\mbox{--}60$\nand $Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 37\\mbox{--}42$. A production of similar fragments\nhas also been observed in TDHF calculations for the side collisions\nof $^{40,48}$Ca+$^{238}$U at $b=0$~fm \\cite{UO(QF2014)}.\nA possible influence of stabilization by strongly bound Zr isotopes\nwith large prolate deformation in this mass region has been\nadvocated \\cite{UO(QF2014)}.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{figure04.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\n   Average numbers of nucleons in lighter (a,~b) and heavier (c,~d) fragments\n   are shown as functions of the impact parameter, $b$.

As in the $x$-direction case, we observe an abrupt change\nof the average number of nucleons at $b \\sim 4\\mbox{--}5$~fm.\nHowever, the plateau around $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 126$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\n\\sim 82$ does not appear. The composite system tends to split into\nmore mass-symmetric fragments. It indicates that the quantum shells\nof $^{208}$Pb are not significant in this case. A similar interplay\nbetween the quantum shells and the nuclear orientation was reported\nin $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U \\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay}, it was reported that quantum\nshells do not contribute in the side collisions of $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U.\nContrarily to it, we find another plateau behavior in the $y$- and\n$z$-direction cases. In the $y$-direction case, at a small-$b$ region,\n0~fm~$\\lesssim b \\lesssim 2$~fm, we observe a plateau at around\n$N_{\\rm H}\\sim 110$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\\sim 72$ for the heavier\nfragment and $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 70$ and $Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 48$ for\nthe lighter fragment. This behavior may be influenced by the shell\neffect of $Z=50$ in the QF process. In the $z$-direction case,\na plateau is seen at around $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 127$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\n\\sim 83$ for the heavier fragment and $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 54$ and\n$Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 37$ for the lighter fragment. This behavior indicate\nthe effect of quantum shells around $^{208}$Pb. We note that\ninfluence of quantum shells in QF processes has been routinely\nobserved experimentally \\cite{Itkis(2004),Nishio(36S+238U),\nNishio(34S+238U),Nishio(4048Ca+238U),Kozulin(2014)1,\nKozulin(2014)IOP,Kozulin(2014)2} and discussed theoretically\n\\cite{Zagrebaev(2005),Zagrebaev(2007)1,Zagrebaev(2013)IQF,\nZagrebaev(2006),Zagrebaev(2007)2,Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay,\nAritomo(2004),Aritomo(2005),Aritomo(2009),Aritomo(2012)}.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that, in the $y$-direction case, the average\nnumber of nucleons changes dramatically when the impact parameter\nbecomes a tiny but a finite value. For instance, from $b=0$ to 0.25~fm,\nthe average number of nucleons changes as large as 25. We consider\nthat the observed behavior is related to the symmetry that appears\nonly at $b=0$ fm in which the colliding system has a rotational symmetry\naround the collision axis. This symmetry disappears once the impact\nparameter becomes finite.\n\nWe note that the behavior at around $b=0$ fm is different\nbetween $y$- and $z$-direction cases. To understand the\norigin of the difference, let us consider reaction dynamics\nviewed from a frame rotating with the vector connecting\ncenters of the two colliding nuclei, ${\\bf R}(t)$. In the\n$z$-direction case, it is recognized that the reaction can be\ncharacterized by the distance between two nuclei irrespective\nof the impact parameter. The system always persists a reflection\nsymmetry with respect to the plane which contains ${\\bf R}(t)$\nand is perpendicular to the reaction plane. On the other hand,\nin the $y$-direction case at a nonzero impact parameter, the\nsystem does not have the symmetry mentioned above due\nto the deformed shape of $^{238}$U. Thus the system may\ngo through more complex shape evolution dynamics. In fact,\nonce the impact parameter becomes nonzero in the $y$-direction\ncase, we find the projectile-like subsystem moving along the\nelongated direction of the $^{238}$U-like subsystem forming\na very thick neck, which results in the abrupt change of the\naverage number of transferred nucleons.\n\nThe orientation dependence is also clearly seen in the TKEL at\na small-$b$ region ($b \\lesssim 4$~fm) in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}~(b).\nIn the $y$- and $z$-direction cases, TKEL takes almost constant\nvalues, $\\sim 70\\mbox{--}80$~MeV. We observe somewhat larger\nvalues of TKEL in the $y$-direction case compared with those of the\n$z$-direction case. This difference may reflect the reflection symmetry\nmentioned above which restricts reaction dynamics in the $z$-direction case.\nIn the $x$-direction case, we observe smaller values, $\\sim 50\\mbox{--}60$~MeV.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{Guillaume(2015)258Fm}, fission dynamics of $^{258}$Fm\nwas investigated by TDHF+BCS approach. It was shown that the TKE\nexhibits clear dependence on the shape of the fissioning nucleus,\nand that the different shape evolution dynamics is associated with\ndifferent valleys in the potential energy surface (PES). Although\nwe have not conducted PES calculations of $_{120}^{302}$Ubn$_{182}^{}$\ncomposite system, we expect that there exists a valley in the PES\nof the composite system associated with the doubly magic $^{208}$Pb\nand that the valley causes the small TKEL and the small contact time.\n\nWe note that an experimentally measured TKE distribution of \n$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at a smaller incident energy, \n$E_{\\rm c.m.}\\sim 282.13$~MeV, was reported \\cite{Kozulin(64Ni+238U)}. \nIn the measurement, a two-peaked structure of TKE was observed. \nAlthough the plot was constructed from selected fragments having\n$A_{\\rm CN}/2 \\pm 20$, it is expected that different dynamics \nassociated with the large deformation of $^{238}$U affects the\nmeasured trends.\n\n\n\\subsection{Incident energy dependence}{\\label{Sec:Edep}}\n\nIn this Subsection, we examine incident energy dependence of QF\nprocesses in $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. We investigate reactions\nat two impact parameters, $b=0.5$~fm and 2~fm, for two orientations\nof $^{238}$U, $x$- and $y$-direction cases.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{figure05.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-3mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $b=0.5$ and 2~fm\n   for $x$- and $y$-direction cases.

Those in the\nheavier fragment are shown in (c) and (d). In (e), contact time is also\npresented. The horizontal axis is the center-of-mass energy, $E_{\\rm c.m.}$.\n\nFirst, we consider the $x$-direction case (open symbols). As\nthe center-of-mass energy increases, we find an abrupt change\nin the fragment masses when the energy exceeds the barrier height,\n$V_{\\rm B}\\sim 242.93$~MeV. Just above the barrier, the fragment\nmasses are about $N_{\\rm L}\\sim 58$ and $Z_{\\rm L}\\sim 40$\nand $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 124$ and $Z_{\\rm H}\\sim 80$ for both\n$b=0.5$- and 2-fm cases.\n\nFor $b=2$~fm case (red open circles), the fragment masses are\nalmost independent of the center-of-mass energy for an energy\nrange, 290~MeV~$\\lesssim E_{\\rm c.m.}\\lesssim$~500~MeV.\nIt indicates a significant influence of the quantum shells around\n$^{208}$Pb, even above barrier energies. On the other hand,\nfor $b=0.5$~fm case (green open squares), the amount of\ntransferred nucleons decreases as the center-of-mass energy\nincreases. This behavior implies that the shell effect is weakened\nas the incident energy increases. We consider that the difference\nbetween $b=0.5$- and 2-fm cases originates from the different\nexcitation energies. In the $x$-direction case, an elongated dinuclear\nsystem is formed as seen in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:Nave_vs_E}~(e).\nNo fusion reaction was observed for whole incident energies\nexamined here in the $x$-direction case.\n\nNext, we consider the $y$-direction case (filled symbols).\nFor both $b=0.5$- and 2-fm cases, we observed similar behavior\nas a function of the center-of-mass energy. As in the $x$-direction\ncase, we find an abrupt change in the fragment masses when the\ncenter-of-mass energy exceeds the barrier height, $V_{\\rm B}\\sim\n263.97$~MeV. In contrast to the $x$-direction case, the fragment\nmasses continue to change as the center-of-mass energy increases, \nup to $E_{\\rm c.m.}\\sim 300$ (350)~MeV for $b=0.5$ (2)~fm.\nWe also find an abrupt change in the contact time, as shown in (e).\nIn the $y$-direction case, the composite system shows a compact\nshape, which becomes a mononuclear shape as the center-of-mass\nenergy increases.\n\nWe note that, in the $y$-direction case at higher center-of-mass\nenergies, $E_{\\rm c.m.}\\gtrsim 300$ (350)~MeV for $b=0.5$ (2)~fm,\na capture process takes place, forming a superheavy composite system with\n$Z=120$. We continued time-evolution calculations up to about $13$~zs\n(20,000 time steps). In this period, the composite system exhibits a\ncompact mononuclear shape. In Ref.~\\cite{Kozulin(64Ni+238U)},\nmeasured fragment mass distributions in $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U\nreaction were reported at several incident energies. They showed\nthat mass-symmetric fragments are hardly produced in the reaction. \nOur results are consistent with the experimental observation, since\nthe highest incident energy of the experiment was $E_{\\rm c.m.}\n\\sim 301.05$~MeV, and is much smaller than the present\nthreshold energy for fusion in our TDHF calculations. Our results\nindicate that more mass-symmetric fragments will be produced\nafter forming a mononuclear system at higher incident energies,\nalthough it should accompany substantial excitation energy.\n\n\n\\section{Comparison with measurements}{\\label{Sec:comparison}}\n\n\\subsection{Production cross sections}\\label{Sec:NTCS}\n\nTo compare with measured cross sections of MNT processes,\nwe employ the PNP method \\cite{Projection,KS_KY_MNT,KS_KY_PNP}.\nWe use the PNP operator,\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\hat{P}_n^{(q)} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi}\ne^{{\\mathrm{i}\\hspace{0.2mm}} (n-\\hat{N}_V^{(q)})\\theta}d\\theta,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\hat{P}_{n}^{(q)}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}e^{{\\mathrm{i}\\hskip 0.569055pt%&#10;}(n-\\hat{N}_{V}^{(q)})\\theta}d\\theta,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>n</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></msubsup><mrow><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+0.6pt\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>-</mo><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mi>V</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo>\ud835\udc51</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06656.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 38625, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\hat{N}_V^{(q)}$ is the number operator in a volume $V$.\nThe probability that $n$ nucleons are included in $V$ is given by\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nP_n^{(q)} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{{\\mathrm{i}\\hspace{0.2mm}} n\\theta}\n\\det\\mathcal{B}^{(q)}(\\theta)\\, d\\theta,\n\\label{Eq:P_n}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"P_{n}^{(q)}=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}e^{{\\mathrm{i}\\hskip 0.569055pt}n%&#10;\\theta}\\det\\mathcal{B}^{(q)}(\\theta)\\,d\\theta,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msubsup><mi>P</mi><mi>n</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><msubsup><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mn>0</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c0</mi></mrow></msubsup><mrow><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mpadded width=\"+0.6pt\"><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">i</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo movablelimits=\"false\">det</mo><mo>\u2061</mo><mrow><msup><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\u212c</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>q</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03b8</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.06656.tex", "nexttext": "\n$\\Theta_{V\\,(\\bar{V})}({\\bf r})$ denotes a space division function\nwhich is equal to 1 inside $V$ ($\\bar{V}$) and 0 elsewhere. $\\bar{V}$\nis the complement of $V$.

We show\ncross sections for $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction cases in left,\nmiddle, and right panels, respectively. To compare with measurements,\nwe should take a proper average over the orientations of $^{238}$U. \nWe did not do it, since it requires too much computational costs.\n\nFrom the figure, we find that the cross sections extend\nwidely in the $N$-$Z$ plane. There is a peak of $\\sigma(N,Z)$ \nat around $(N_{\\rm L},Z_{\\rm L})=(36, 28)$ in (a-c) for\nlighter fragments and $(N_{\\rm H}, Z_{\\rm H})=(146, 92)$ in (d-f)\nfor heavier fragments. They are contributed from a large-$b$\nregion, $b \\gtrsim 5$~fm. We also find a peak in $\\sigma(N,Z)$\nlocated inside a region of $N_{\\rm L}>50$, $Z_{\\rm L}>30$ in\n(a-c) and $N_{\\rm H}<130$, $Z_{\\rm H}<90$ in (d-f). They are\nproduced by the QF processes accompanying a large mass-drift\ntoward the mass symmetry, which take place in a small-$b$ region,\n$b \\lesssim 4$~fm. The appearance of separated peaks in the\n$N$-$Z$ plane is caused by the abrupt change of the reaction\nmechanism from quasielastic and MNT to QF at $b\\sim\n4\\mbox{--}5$~fm. The peak positions are consistent with\nthe observation in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:Nave}.\n\nIn Ref.~\\cite{Corradi(64Ni+238U)}, experimentally measured\ntransfer cross sections for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at\n$E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV were reported. In Fig.~\\ref{FIG:NTCS},\nwe show a comparison of transfer cross sections between our TDHF\nresults and the measurements as a function of the mass number\nof lighter fragments. Each panel shows cross sections for different\nproton-transfer channel. The number of transferred protons is\nindicated by ($\\pm x$p;~X), where X stands for a corresponding\nelement. The plus sign is for transfer processes from $^{238}$U\nto $^{64}$Ni (pickup), while the minus sign is for the opposite direction\n(stripping). Measured cross sections are shown by red filled circles.\nTDHF results in $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction cases are shown\nby red solid, green dashed, and blue dotted histograms,\nrespectively. Cross sections calculated by the {\\mbox{\\small GRAZING }} code\n\\cite{GRAZING-online} using standard input parameters\n\\footnote{\nInput parameters that we used for the {\\mbox{\\small GRAZING }} calculation:\nFor low-lying excitations: $E_2=1.35$ (0.04)~MeV, $B(E_2)=0.076$ (12.09)~$e^2$b$^2$,\n$E_3=3.56$ (0.73)~MeV, $B(E_3)=0.022$ (0.58)~$e^2$b$^2$; for giant resonances:\n$E_2=57$~(94)~$A^{-1/3}$~MeV, strength~=~0.8 (0.4)~\\% of sum rule, width~=~2.5 (6);\nfor single-particle states: $\\delta^\\nu=8$, $\\delta^\\pi=8$, level density~=~2.455 (2.053) MeV$^{-1}$\n(neutron), 10.527 (8.298)~MeV$^{-1}$ (proton); these values are for projectile (target).\n}\nare also shown by filled areas.\n\nWe note that experimental data are suffered by effects of particle\nevaporation from excited reaction products, whereas the TDHF results\ncorrespond to primary cross sections just after the reseparation.\nIn addition, the measurement was performed for an angular range\nof $50^\\circ \\le \\theta_{\\rm lab} \\le 105^\\circ$ to cover the main\ntransfer channels in grazing reactions, whereas the TDHF results are\nobtained by Eq.~(\\ref{Eq:sigmatot}) without filtering by the scattering\nangle, as in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:sigma_NZ}.\n\nFrom the figure, we find that the TDHF results reasonably reproduce\nmeasured cross sections for (0p), ($\\pm 1$p), and ($-2$p) channels.\nAs the number of removed protons increases (($-x$p) with $x \\ge 3$),\nthe peak position of experimental cross sections shifts toward less mass\n(neutron) numbers, which is not reproduced by the TDHF results.\nThe disagreement may partly be originated from the evaporation effect.\nWe note that, although the peak position is different, the height of the\npeaks of the cross sections for proton-stripping channels is in good\nagreement with the experimental data, up to ($-4$p) channels.\n\nSimilar disagreement was observed in lighter systems\n\\cite{KS_KY_MNT,KS_KY_FUSION14,Bidyut(2015),KS_KY_Maruhn}.\nIn Refs.~\\cite{KS_KY_FUSION14,Bidyut(2015),KS_KY_Maruhn},\nwe investigated particle evaporation effects on MNT cross sections\nusing a statistical model. Although the inclusion of the evaporation\neffect improved the agreement between TDHF results and measurements,\nthere remain disagreements for channels involving a number of transferred\nnucleons far from the average values in the TDHF calculation. This failure\nindicates a necessity of descriptions beyond the TDHF theory. Beyond\nmean-field theories such as the method of Balian and V\\'en\\'eroni\n\\cite{BV(1981),Simenel(BV2011)} and the stochastic mean-field\napproach \\cite{SMF(2008),SMF(2009)1,SMF(2009)2,SMF(2012),\nSMF(2013),SMF(2014),SMF(2015)} have recently been developed,\nwhich are expected to improve the discrepancies.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{FIG:NTCS}, we find that the cross sections depend\nrather weakly on the initial orientation of $^{238}$U. Difference\nis substantial only for ($-5$p), ($-6$p), and ($+2$p) channels.\nDifferences in these channels are associated with the different\ntrends of nucleon transfer. The proton-stripping processes are\noriginated from an impact parameter region, $b\\sim 5\\mbox{--}6$~fm,\nas shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:Nave}. From the insets shown in\nFig.~\\ref{FIG:Nave}~(b,~d), we find that proton-stripping\nprocesses are favored in the $x$-direction case. This trend results\nin the difference in ($-5$p) and ($-6$p) channels. In Fig.~\\ref{FIG:Nave},\na gradual change of the average number of nucleons was observed\nin the $z$-direction case. This change brings a large contribution to\n($+1$p) and ($+2$p) channels from a wide impact parameter range.\n\nFrom a comparison between cross sections by TDHF and those by\n{\\small GRAZING}, we find that the TDHF results show a better\noverall agreement with experimental data. It is remarkable that\nthe TDHF calculation provides substantial cross sections for the \nproton-pickup channels. The {\\mbox{\\small GRAZING }} calculation underestimates \ncross sections for those channels, especially for ($+2$p) channel, \nfor which the TDHF calculation overestimates. In Ref.~\\cite{Corradi(64Ni+238U)},\nit was mentioned that lighter fragments with proton numbers up to\n$Z \\sim 40$ were observed experimentally, especially at forward\nangles, although quantitative cross sections were not shown.\nThe TDHF calculation provides substantial cross sections for lighter \nfragments with $Z\\sim 40$ (cf.~Fig.~\\ref{FIG:sigma_NZ}~(a-c)) as a \nresult of the QF processes at a small-$b$ region ($b \\lesssim 4$~fm).\n\n\n\\subsection{Wilczy\\'nski plot}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[b]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{figure08.eps}\n\\end{center}\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\caption{(Color online)\n   Wilczy\\'nski plots.\n   (a): TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.\n   Results for $x\\mbox{-},$ $y$-, and $z$-direction cases are shown by red circles,\n   green crosses, and blue open triangles connected with dotted lines, respectively.\n   (b): Experimental data of  Wilczy\\'nski plots for main transfer channels,\n   ($+1$n), ($+2$n), ($-1$p), and ($-2$p), in $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U\n   reaction at $E_{\\rm lab}=390$~MeV.

Similar comparisons of MADs between TDHF \ncalculations and measurements have been reported for $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U\n\\cite{Wakhle(QF2014)Interplay} and $^{50,54}$Cr+$^{180,186}$W\n\\cite{Hammerton(2015)}.\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{FIG:MAD}~(a), we show the MAD plot in the TDHF calculation,\nwhich is constructed from the results shown in Figs.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}~(a)\nand \\ref{FIG:Nave} for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm c.m.}\n\\sim 307.35$~MeV.

Because the inverse\nkinematics was employed in the experiment, the angle of $180^\\circ\n-\\theta_{\\rm c.m.}$ is used in the plot of (a).\n\nAs seen from Figs.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}~(a) and \\ref{FIG:Nave},\nboth scattering angle and fragment masses change substantially when\ntwo nuclei start to overlap in the course of collision. These trends\ninduce correlated behavior in (a) showing an oblique distribution\nfrom $A_{\\rm L(H)}=64$ (238) to $A_{\\rm L(H)}\\sim 100$ (200),\nalthough no such behavior is seen in the experimental data in (b).\nWe note that the TDHF calculation provides no contributions to $\\theta\n_{\\rm c.m.}\\lesssim$ ($\\gtrsim$) $90^\\circ$ at $A \\sim 64$ (238),\ndue to the classical nature of the trajectory.\n\nIn our TDHF calculations, collisions at a small-$b$ region in which the\nmass-drift mode toward the mass symmetry is observed produce an\nisotropic distribution in the MAD for a wide range of the scattering angle.\nThe experimentally measured MAD also shows a similar isotropic distribution. \nIn the TDHF calculations, reactions of the $x$- and $z$-direction cases \nproduce fragments of $A_{\\rm L}\\sim 90\\mbox{--}100$ and $A_{\\rm H}\n\\sim 200\\mbox{--}210$, while those of the $y$-direction case produce\nfragments around $A_{\\rm L}\\sim 120$ and $A_{\\rm H}\\sim 180$. \nTherefore, we expect that the yields in the MAD of the fragments with\nsymmetric masses are caused by the collisions in the $y$-direction case.\n\n\n\\subsection{Mass-TKE distribution}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n   \\begin{center}\n   \\includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{figure10.eps}\n   \\end{center}\\vspace{-4mm}\n   \\caption{(Color online)\n   Mass-TKE (total kinetic energy) distribution plots.\n   (a): TDHF results for $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction at $E_{\\rm c.m.}\n   \\sim 307.35$~MeV.

The TDHF results show\nminima at $A_{\\rm L}\\sim 75$ and $A_{\\rm H} \\sim 225$ with\nTKE~$\\sim 200$ in the $y$-direction case. In the measurement,\nwe find minima at similar values of masses and TKE in the green\nareas which correspond to relatively large yields. The mass-TKE\ndistribution in the TDHF calculation extends toward the mass symmetry,\nup to $A_{\\rm L}\\sim 100\\mbox{--}120$ and $A_{\\rm H}\\sim\n180\\mbox{--}200$. This trend also reasonably agrees with the \nexperimental data in (b).\n\nBoth the mass-TKE distributions obtained from the TDHF calculations\nand the measurement show a similar trend that the TKE value increases\nas the system approaches to the mass symmetry. This behavior can\nbe understood by the Viola systematics \\cite{Viola0,Viola1,Viola2},\nwhich assumes that the TKE is produced by the Coulomb repulsion\nat a scission configuration of the composite system. The Viola\nsystematics is shown by a gray solid curve in (a). Similar comparison\nwas reported for side collisions of $^{40}$Ca+$^{238}$U at\n$b=0$~fm \\cite{UO(QF2014)}.\n\nLooking in detail at results shown in (a), our TDHF results indicate\nthat the $x$-direction case shows smaller dissipation (larger TKE)\nthan the $y$-direction case, as observed in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:theta+TKEL_vs_b}~(b).\nThis may reflect the shell effect of $^{208}$Pb, which is important\nonly in the $x$-direction case as shown in Fig.~\\ref{FIG:Nave}.\n\n\n\\section{SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION}{\\label{Sec:summary}}\n\nIn this article, we have reported a detailed investigation of\nmultinucleon transfer (MNT) and quasifission (QF) processes\nin $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction within the microscopic\nframework of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory.\nFor this reaction, abundant experimental data are available for \nboth MNT \\cite{Corradi(64Ni+238U)} and QF processes \n\\cite{Toke(QF1985),Kozulin(64Ni+238U)}. We compared\nour  TDHF results with the experimental data.\n\nBecause $^{238}$U is substantially deformed in a prolate shape,\nwe performed TDHF calculations for three initial orientations of\n$^{238}$U: the symmetry axis of $^{238}$U is set parallel to\nthe collision axis, set parallel to the impact parameter vector,\nand set perpendicular to the reaction plane. We have called these\nthree cases as $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-direction cases, respectively.\n\nIn all cases, a fast charge equilibration process was observed because\nof the large $N/Z$ asymmetry (1.29 for $^{64}$Ni and 1.59 for\n$^{238}$U). In peripheral collisions, MNT processes take place.\nSeveral neutrons and protons are transferred toward the direction\nexpected from the initial $N/Z$ ratios. When two nuclei collide deeply\nat small impact parameters, a dinuclear system connected by a thick\nneck is formed. When the neck raptures after the charge equilibration\nin the dinuclear system, the shape evolution dynamics leading to\nthe rapture of the neck characterizes the amount of nucleon transfers.\nWe have regarded the latter process as a QF process, characterized by\na large number of transferred nucleons, a large amount of energy loss, \nand a long contact time. \n\nFor the MNT process, we evaluated transfer cross sections using\nthe particle-number projection method and compared them with\nexperimental data \\cite{Corradi(64Ni+238U)}. When the number of\ntransferred nucleons is small, the TDHF calculation reasonably describes\nthe process. As the number of transferred protons increases, there is\na disagreement between the TDHF calculation and the measurements.\nThe TDHF calculation gives a peak in the MNT cross section at less \ntransferred nucleons than the measurements. Similar success and\nfailure have been observed in lighter systems \\cite{KS_KY_MNT,\nBidyut(2015),KS_KY_FUSION14,KS_KY_Maruhn}.\n\nIn QF processes, we have found that there appear substantial orientation\ndependences. In $x$- ($y$-) direction case, we have found a larger (smaller)\nTKE and a shorter (longer) contact time. In the $x$-direction case\n(close to the tip collision), an elongated dinuclear system is formed.\nThis elongated system tends to split into two fragments in which\na heavier fragment is close to $^{208}$Pb. This indicates a significant\neffect of the quantum shells of $^{208}$Pb in the $x$-direction case.\nOn the other hand, in the $y$-direction case (close to the side collision),\na compact dinuclear system is formed. This system tends to split into more\nmass-symmetric fragments, showing less influence of the quantum shells\nof $^{208}$Pb. Instead, we observed an indication of a shell effect of\n$Z=50$ in the $y$-direction case.\n\nFor QF processes, we compared average fragment masses, scattering\nangle, and total kinetic energy (TKE) of outgoing fragments with\nexperimental data \\cite{Toke(QF1985),Kozulin(64Ni+238U)}.\nFrom the comparison, we found that the TDHF calculations reasonably\ndescribe gross behavior seen in the experimental data. We consider\nthat these agreements are noteworthy since no empirical parameters\nare involved in our calculations.\n\nOne of the important applications of the microscopic TDHF theory\nis to predict optimal conditions to produce objective unstable nuclei,\nincluding superheavy elements. One interesting observation in the\npresent study is the occurrence of a capture process in the $y$-direction\ncase at incident energies substantially higher than the Coulomb barrier.\nTo make a reliable prediction, it is important to take account of the effect\nof particle evaporation in competition with fission employing a statistical\nmodel. A study along this direction is in progress \\cite{KS_KY_PNP,\nKS_KY_FUSION14,KS_KY_Maruhn}.\n\nThe present study elucidates to what extent the microscopic TDHF\ntheory can describe damped collisions of heavy nuclei at low energies,\ntaking $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U system as an example. The significance\nof the nuclear structure effects in QF processes is clearly demonstrated\nfor this system. To increase reliability of descriptions for MNT and QF\nprocesses, extensions of the theory going beyond the mean-field\ndescription are required.\n\n\\begin{acknowledgments}\nOne of the authors (K.S.) appreciates K.~Washiyama and B.J.~Roy\nfor giving valuable comments on this article.
