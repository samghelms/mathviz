because the wakes of upstream turbines diminish flow to downstream turbines. \nHere we analyze systematic deflection of the wakes to direct unimpeded flow onto the downstream turbines and increase the area power density.\nWe examine the case of an abstract 1D turbine-deflector array aligned parallel to a 2D free stream flow, in which case the array presents negligible frontal area to the flow without deflection.\nUsing the framework of inviscid fluid dynamics, the flow manipulation is decomposed into flow deflection due to bound vorticity in the array, and energy extraction resulting from free vorticity shed by the array.\nWhile this general framework is agnostic to the technological details, it captures the geometry of a vertical fence of turbines and deflectors along the centerline of a river, minimizing the array footprint.\nWe find a localized array can direct significant kinetic energy through itself, while having a minimal impact on array efficiency; the fraction of the energy incident on the array that is ultimately extracted.\nThe maximum array efficiency decreases from ${ 57}\\%-{ 39}\\%$ at high deflection due to recirculation at the edges of the array.\nHowever, the increase in deflected flow through the array overwhelms the small efficiency decrease.\nUsing state-of-the-art deflector technology with minimal flow separation, we predict an order of magnitude improvement in array power density, as compared to arrays without systematic flow manipulation.\nA pragmatic discussion of deflection mechanisms, applications, and future extension to 3D flows are included.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nPractical considerations prevent the placement of tidal, riverine, and wind turbines at locations in the flow where they can extract maximum power.\nFor riverine and tidal power, the hotspots of fast flow occur at narrow constrictions in the channel, and anything less than a complete fence of turbines \\cite{Garrett2005} across the flow constriction greatly reduces the potential of the site \\cite{Vennell2010, Vennell2011, Cummins2013}. \nHowever, navigation and environmental considerations prohibit construction of such arrays \\cite{Garrett2007,Vennell2015}. \nSimilarly, wind turbines cannot be constructed at locations of faster wind speed high up in the atmosphere due to structural constraints \\cite{Thresher2007}.\n\n\nInstead, the most practical arrangement of wind turbines is an array of turbines mounted on the ground in rows, where only turbines at the front of the array have access to direct flow and energy transport to turbines in the center of the array is limited.\nAny large riverine or tidal array in this configuration would suffer from the same limitations \\cite{Vennell2015,Jeffcoate2016}.\nKinetic energy flowing higher in the atmosphere or the water column is redirected by turbulence on the turbines in the array \\cite{Calaf2010,Divett2013}. \nTherefore, subsequent rows of turbines must be placed far enough back for turbulent mixing to redirect kinetic energy from higher elevations to replenish the deficit in the turbine wakes \\cite{Newman1977,Frandsen1992}. \nThe rate of kinetic energy redirection ultimately limits the performance of the turbine array, and approaches to relax this limit are actively sought \\cite{Dabiri2011a,Wagenaar2012,Fleming2014,VerHulst2015,Churchfield2015}.\n\nIf turbines must be placed in practical locations, the objective can be reframed as directing more kinetic energy to the turbines and extracting it.  \nHere we present a framework for systematic flow manipulation to redirect flow kinetic energy to the location of the turbines. \n\nWe illustrate our framework using a simple two-dimensional example of a linear array embedded in an infinite domain with uniform freestream flow. \nThis analysis is motivated by an unconventional riverine turbine array configuration, one in which the turbines are arranged in a vertical fence along the river centerline as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:Schematic}~(c).\nOur results directly apply to the cases for which the presence of the river banks and uneven bottom topography can be ignored.\n\n\\subsection{Dimensionless power density}\nIn order to quantify the effectiveness of different mechanisms for redirecting kinetic energy through the array, we define a dimensionless power density, ${C_A}$, as\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{align}\n {C_A} = \\dfrac{{\\dot{W}}}{ \\frac{1}{2}\\rho U^3

Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(c), our result corresponds to a dimensional array power density of ${506}$ W/m$^2$ for a 1.5 m/s flow.\nThrough this work, we not only demonstrate a limit on the energy density of the deflector-turbine array, but also present a framework that can be extended for other cases by incorporating additional constraints, such as boundaries defined by river banks or the ground.\n\nThe rest of this paper will be devoted to explaining the mathematical genesis and physical intuition of the limits on ${C_A}$. \nWe begin by explaining the fluid dynamics framework for our model based on steady inviscid vorticity dynamics, which provides a natural means of decomposing deflection and energy extraction within the array. \nNext, we use the framework to derive bounds on the

parameters: a flow reduction factor and the ratio of the wake velocity to free stream velocity. \n\nFinally, we discuss possible physical realizations of deflectors, the applications to hydrokinetic energy, and possible future extensions.\n\n\\section{Framework: Abstract array in an inviscid flow}\n\nWhile turbines are generally deployed in discrete arrangements, here we consider an array so dense that their collective influence on the flow may be modeled by employing the continuum limit.\nTypically, the frontal area of the turbines is much smaller than the area of the array, and we idealize the array to have negligible (zero) thickness.\n\nInviscid fluid dynamics governs the essential features of the flow that develops around the turbine array.\nWe represent the deflection of the fluid by the array as bound vorticity within the array and the turbine energy extraction as a source of free vorticity in the flow surrounding the array.\nIn the framework of inviscid dynamics the array can only influence the flow through the bound and free vorticity.\nTherefore, our framework incorporates the most general manipulation the deflector-turbine array can have on the flow.\nAlthough the geometry is different, the spirit of our work is inspired by Lanchester-Betz-Joukowsky ({LBJ}) analysis; we seek a minimal picture which is useful to guide our intuition and assist with the practical design of turbine arrays. \n\nWe currently neglect other sources of free vorticity, such as the viscous boundary layer around the deflectors, and the influence of unsteadiness, viscosity and turbulence on the dynamics of free vorticity.\nSuch effects could be incorporated by embedding our framework within a larger computational fluid dynamics model \\cite{Calaf2010,Divett2013}. \n\nThe incompressible flow velocity ${\\boldsymbol{u}}({\\boldsymbol{x}})$ at any point ${\\boldsymbol{x}}$ in the two-dimensional $x-y$ plane (with $z$ perpendicular to the plane) around the array may be described in terms of the vorticity ${\\omega}({\\boldsymbol{x}}) {\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}} = {\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}} \\times {\\boldsymbol{u}}({\\boldsymbol{x}})$ as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation",

${A_\\text{array}}$ is the vertical area formed by the product of the array length and the water depth.\nIn both these cases, the turbines are arranged in a plane parallel to the free stream.\nFor a

kinetic energy is directed normal to the free stream flow and into the array.\nFor arrays of significant three-dimensional thickness the sides may need to be included. \n\n\nThis coefficient provides a useful measure to compare kinetic energy redirection and extraction across similar types of array configurations, but for different fluid densities, flow speeds, and array sizes.\n\nAs a reference

experiments \\cite{Cal2010,Kinzel2012a}.\nWe ask if ${C_A}$ can be improved above these value and determine fundamental limits on these improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Mean flow manipulation for increasing energy density}\nHere we present systematic manipulation of the \\emph{mean} flow as a mechanism for increasing, or otherwise altering, the energy density of turbine arrays.\nThe simplest way to manipulate the mean flow is using an arrangement of deflector surfaces, as shown for the case we consider in the inset of Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(a,c), to locally direct the flow. \nThese deflector elements are combined with energy extracting elements, the turbines, to form the deflector-turbine array.\nWhile the deflectors only interact with the local flow, the aggregate influence they exert may extend over a length scale comparable to the size of the array itself.\nIn this manner, the extent and the strength of the flow modification can be designed.\nOur results imply a conceptual decomposition of the influence of the flow deflection and the energy extraction on the performance of the array.\n\n\\subsection{Vertical array of turbines along the river centerline} \nTo demonstrate our ideas, we consider a turbine-deflector array constrained to a single row of length $L$ aligned with the free stream flow speed $U$, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:Schematic}~(a).\nWhile the general framework may be extended to three dimensions, we limit our analysis to a two-dimensional setting for elucidating the essential principles.\n\nA particular flow modification we seek is to deflect the wake of upstream turbines away from the array and redirect undepleted flow onto downstream turbines \\cite{Wagenaar2012,Churchfield2015}; \nan example of such a flow without and with energy extraction is shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(a) and (b), respectively.\nIn this article, we analyze this type of flow manipulation to determine the optimal power density obtained by using deflector plates aligned at a constant angle ${\\alpha}$ to the flow.\nThis simplified 1-D deflector-turbine array can provide guidance for concrete applications. \nMost directly it informs the implementation of a vertical fence of deflector-turbines located along the center of a river, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(c).\nAs we discuss later, this configuration may be better suited for riverine and tidal power extraction compared to rows of turbines installed on the bed.\n\n\n\\subsection{Flow deflection increases ${C_A}$} \nA key variable in our formulation is the flow rate $Q_0$, and an associated kinetic energy flux $\\rho Q_0 U^2/2$, deflected to flow through the array without boundary layer separation on the deflector surfaces.\n\nThe turbine array can extract at most a fraction ${\\eta_\\text{max}}$ of this incident kinetic energy.\nUsing

of bound vorticity ${\\omega_b}$ and the free vorticity ${\\omega_f}$ as ${\\omega} = {\\omega_b} + {\\omega_f}$.\n\n\\subsection{Flow deflection and bound vorticity} \nIn our framework, the bound vorticity is a fictitious instrument that represents the effect of the deflector array, and in the most general case is agnostic to the method of fluid deflection. \nIt is located inside the array and we use it to impose the fluid flowing through the array at a constant angle ${\\alpha}$ relative to freestream, which simulates flow through a dense array of foils at a constant angle of attack ${\\alpha}$.\nWe further consider the deflection to occur in a regime where the boundary layer around the deflector plates remains attached, and therefore the deflectors introduce negligible amount of free vorticity in the flow.\n\nManipulating the flow with bound vorticity alone, the array cannot extract any energy from the flow.\nThis result follows from the observation that the velocity field due to bound vorticity alone recovers to its freestream value far downstream (see SI \\S 2), as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(a).\nThe wake of the array therefore has no kinetic energy deficit, and the array cannot extract any energy.\nThe bound vorticity, however, deflects fluid at the rate $Q_0$ to flow through the array, and thus implies that kinetic energy is incident on the array at the rate $\\rho Q_0 U^2/2$\n\nThis energy can be extracted from the flow by introducing free vorticity.\n\n\\subsection{Energy extraction and free vorticity}\nIn our framework, the free vorticity in the flow is introduced (or shed) by the turbine array, capturing the effects of energy extraction by the turbines on the fluid flow. \nIn analogy with the {LBJ}~analysis, we shed vorticity of specified strength from the array along the two streamlines C and D, bounded by the recirculation regions near the array ends, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(b).\nThese streamlines are selected to be the extreme streamlines which pass through the array and continue down-stream (they do not recirculate).\nBoth the difference in geometry (the streamlines must bend to flow through the array) and the possibility that the extreme streamlines will not be located at the edge of the array differentiate this analysis from {LBJ}.\nOnce introduced, the free vorticity is advected by the flow along the streamlines in the form of a vortex sheet without any change in its strength, in accordance with inviscid fluid dynamics \\cite{Saffman1992,Lighthill1986}, and forms the wake of the array.\nWe numerically determine the streamlines, the bound vorticity, and the shape of the free vortex sheet in a self-consistent manner such that the free vorticity is constant along the streamlines and the flow velocity maintains an angle of attack ${\\alpha}$ with the freestream flow direction (see SI \\S 4 for details).\n\nThe free vorticity introduced by the turbine array is linked to the energy conversion.\nThe wake velocity far downstream, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(b), points in the freestream direction, but its magnitude $V$ does not recover to the freestream value $U$.\nThe deficit of velocity in the wake $U-V$ is, by definition, the strength of the vortex sheet.\nApplying energy balance to a control volume, shown as ABCD in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(b), between the two streamlines on which vorticity is shed yields the deficit of kinetic energy flux in the wake as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 14105, "prevtext":

as ${\\omega} = {\\omega_b} + {\\omega_f}$.\n\n\\subsection{Flow deflection and bound vorticity} \nIn our framework, the bound vorticity is a fictitious instrument that represents the effect of the deflector array, and in the most general case is agnostic to the method of fluid deflection. \nIt is located inside the array and we use it to impose the fluid flowing through the array at a constant angle ${\\alpha}$ relative to freestream, which simulates flow through a dense array of foils at a constant angle of attack ${\\alpha}$.\nWe further consider the deflection to occur in a regime where the boundary layer around the deflector plates remains attached, and therefore the deflectors introduce negligible amount of free vorticity in the flow.\n\nManipulating the flow with bound vorticity alone, the array cannot extract any energy from the flow.\nThis result follows from the observation that the velocity field due to bound vorticity alone recovers to its freestream value far downstream (see SI \\S 2), as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(a).\nThe wake of the array therefore has no kinetic energy deficit, and the array cannot extract any energy.\nThe bound vorticity, however, deflects fluid at the rate $Q_0$ to flow through the array, and thus implies that kinetic energy is incident on the array at the rate $\\rho Q_0 U^2/2$\n\nThis energy can be extracted from the flow by introducing free vorticity.\n\n\\subsection{Energy extraction and free vorticity}\nIn our framework, the free vorticity in the flow is introduced (or shed) by the turbine array, capturing the effects of energy extraction by the turbines on the fluid flow. \nIn analogy with the {LBJ}~analysis, we shed vorticity of specified strength from the array along the two streamlines C and D, bounded by the recirculation regions near the array ends, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(b).\nThese streamlines are selected to be the extreme streamlines which pass through the array and continue down-stream (they do not recirculate).\nBoth the difference in geometry (the streamlines must bend to flow through the array) and the possibility that the extreme streamlines will not be located at the edge of the array differentiate this analysis from {LBJ}.\nOnce introduced, the free vorticity is advected by the flow along the streamlines in the form of a vortex sheet without any change in its strength, in accordance with inviscid fluid dynamics \\cite{Saffman1992,Lighthill1986}, and forms the wake of the array.\nWe numerically determine the streamlines, the bound vorticity, and the shape of the free vortex sheet in a self-consistent manner such that the free vorticity is constant along the streamlines and the flow velocity maintains an angle of attack ${\\alpha}$ with the freestream flow direction (see SI \\S 4 for details).\n\nThe free vorticity introduced by the turbine array is linked to the energy conversion.\nThe wake velocity far downstream, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(b), points in the freestream direction, but its magnitude $V$ does not recover to the freestream value $U$.\nThe deficit of velocity in the wake $U-V$ is, by definition, the strength of the vortex sheet.\nApplying energy balance to a control volume, shown as ABCD in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(b), between the two streamlines on which vorticity is shed yields the deficit of kinetic energy flux in the wake as\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{align}\n{\\dot{W}} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\rho Q (U^2 - V^2),\n\\label{eqn:kedeficit}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math

respectively.\n\nIn our configuration, the flow reduction occurs for two reasons.\nThe first is due to resistance offered to the flow by the turbine array, which causes more fluid to flow around the turbine array.\nAs resistance from the actuator disk is the cause of flow reduction in the {LBJ}~analysis, we expect the quantitative contribution of this mechanism of flow reduction to be the similar.\nIn the {LBJ}~analysis the flow reduction is $Q/Q_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+V/U\\right)$, plotted as a dashed black line in Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower}~(b).\n\nWe implicitly neglect any losses due to the space between individual turbines.\nIndeed the expected flow reduction for our array at the weak deflection limit, the uppermost red line plotted in Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower}, is close (but not identical) to the {LBJ}~line.\nThis similarity between our flow reduction factor and that of {LBJ}, arises from the similarity of our procedure for determining efficiency using an energy balance on a volume defined by two streamlines shedding vorticity.\n\nThe second reason for flow reduction is the development of recirculation regions at the edges of the array.\nA detailed characterization of the size of the recirculation regions is presented in SI \\S 5.\nAs the recirculation regions are small but finite in the limit of weak deflection, the flow reduction factor, $Q/Q_0$ differs only slightly from the {LBJ}~case (the difference between the red and black lines).\nIn the case of strong deflection, the influence of the turbine array resistance on size of the

which in turn arises from the increase in size of the recirculation zones due to resistance to the flow offered by the turbines.\nIn summary, deflecting more flow through the array slightly decreases the efficiency of the array at extracting the impinging energy.\n\nA bound on the array power density can be obtained by recognizing that, by definition, $\\eta \\le {\\eta_\\text{max}}$, and which upon substitution into {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ca}}}} leads to {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\subsection{Increase in deflected-flow strength outweighs drop in turbine efficiency}\n\nThe array power density in {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}} has opposing dependences on the flow deflection and turbine efficiency. \nOn one hand, the maximum possible efficiency of energy conversion, shown in the inset of Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower}~(a), decreases with the deflected-flow strength.\nBut on the other hand, the stronger the deflected flow, the more kinetic energy impinges on the turbines in the array.\nArray power density is effected more strongly by the order of magnitude increase of impinging kinetic energy due to deflection than the decrease in array efficiency from  ${ 0.57}$  to ${ 0.39}$.\nTherefore, larger array power densities are possible if the bound vorticity in the deflector-turbine array can be reinforced and greater flow deflected, without influencing the free vorticity.\nIn other words, an optimal value for the deflected-flow strength does not emerge as part of our analysis; \nthe greater the deflected-flow strength without flow separation, the higher can the array power density be.\n\n\n\\subsection{Methods for flow deflection} \n\nOur results, because of their basis in vorticity dynamics, are agnostic to the specific deflecting and energy converting mechanisms employed in the array.\nFor manipulating the flow, the most obvious candidates we present is an array of airfoil-shaped deflector plates interspersed with the turbines. \nA host of other techniques, such as turbines oriented at an angle to the flow \\cite{Wagenaar2012,Fleming2014,Churchfield2015}, or foils oscillating asymmetrically about their mean positions, to vector its wake at an angle to the free stream are conceivable.\nThe underlying essential principle is that the turbine array introduce the appropriate bound and free vorticity.\n\n{Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}} shows that the bound on array power density depends on the ability of the array to deflect the flow with minimal introduction of free vorticity.\nHigh-lift aerodynamic surfaces are ideal candidates for this purpose because they are designed to introduce the highest bound vorticity in the flow without significant flow separation.\nThese surfaces can lead to a lift coefficient of up to 4.5 \\cite{Smith1973,Liebeck1978,Lin1997}, which implies bound vorticity equivalent to a flat plate at an approximately 40$^\\circ$ angle of attack.\nUsing these as reference deflectors to estimate the maximum array energy density that can be realized with current technology, we substitute $\\alpha=40^\\circ$ in {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}} and obtain ${C_A} = { 0.30}$.\nThis result is plotted in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Applications to hydrokinetic power}\nOne of the direct applications of our approach is an unconventional configuration for tidal and riverine turbine arrays -- \none in a vertical plane oriented parallel to the flow as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(c).\nIn a water stream with 1.5 m/s flow speed, our estimate for the dimensional array energy density is ${506}$ W/m$^2$ (${C_A}=0.3$) compared to 4.6 W/m$^2$ (${C_A}=2.7 \\times 10^{-3}$) arising from turbulent mixing in a large conventional array, or 20 W/m$^2$ arising in smaller arrays (${C_A} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the higher energy density, the unconventional configuration offers several practical advantages.\nThe array makes efficient use of the space, by allowing other uses of the water body and keeping navigational channels open.\nEqually importantly, this configuration allows turbines to span the whole depth of the water column.\nThis possibility implies that only turbine blades or hydrofoils need to be submerged under water, and other mechanical and electrical components may be housed above the surface of water. Operating the drive-train, generators, and interconnecting cables above water reduces the initial installation costs by eliminating the need for marinization, and the operations and maintenance cost by providing easy access.\nWhile a detailed techno-economic analysis is beyond the scope of this article, the results presented here provide an integral component needed to perform cost-benefit analysis of incorporating flow deflection in hydrokinetic turbine arrays. \n\nIn our analysis, we have ignored the presence of any boundaries on the fluid domain, due to the simplicity it provides for analysis and our focus on the essential principles.\nFor an array length comparable with the channel width, the presence of boundaries will influence the flow and the performance of the array.\nHowever, for arrays shorter than channel width, the influence of the boundaries can be neglected, and our analysis is applicable.\nThe neglect of boundaries is not a fundamental limitation of our approach or our analysis.\nBoundaries can be incorporated using the method of images or boundary integral methods for potential flow to obtain improved bounds and to better design the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Possible extensions and future directions}\nThe extension of our framework to three-dimensional flows requires incorporating the more general vorticity dynamics.\nJust as lifting line theory for three-dimensional wings is based on the two-dimensional Kutta-Joukowsky relation between bound vorticity and airfoil lift, our results in two dimensions provide the foundation for such an extension to three dimensions.\nFurthermore, unsteadiness and turbulence in the flow, the role of fluid viscosity, presence of shear in the freestream, the presence of ground and other boundaries, and the discrete nature of the array will reduce the performance below the limits we present here.\nWe have also not accounted for gravity, the free interface, and bed friction for the hydrokinetic application.\nAs can be seen from Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(d), a $5^\\circ$ deflection of the flow leads to equal or greater ${C_A}$ than due to turbulent mixing.\nTherefore, we expect the influence of deflection greater than $5^\\circ$ to overwhelm the influence of turbulence.\nThese effects could be examined more carefully by embedding the deflector-turbine array in a larger computational fluid dynamics model and through controlled experiments.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe presented systematic flow manipulation as a strategy to deflect untapped kinetic energy towards a device array consisting of flow deflectors and turbines.\nWe use the framework of inviscid fluid dynamics to decompose the effects of array on fluid flow into deflection, captured in bound vorticity, and energy extraction, captured by shed vorticity. \nThe results calculated here represent upper bounds on performance that are agnostic to the specific technology at the array.\n\nUsing the array to impose deflection on the fluid flow can provide an order of magnitude increase in array power density from that achieved by existing arrays.\nThe large gain in kinetic energy deflected onto the array (deflected-flow strength) outweighs the small decrease in array's efficiency at extracting that energy (from { 57}\\% - { 39}\\%) due to increased recirculation.\nWe expect the essential ingredients of this analysis to inform more complicated methods of flow deflection and three-dimensional situations.\n\nFuture investigations building on this analysis will help evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n{\\bf Acknowledgments} \\\\\nWe acknowledge support from the DOE ARPA-E grant DE-AR0000318 for this work. \n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=155mm]{Figures/Summary}\n} \n\\caption{\nThe motivation behind, the flow field arising from, and the performance of an abstract deflector-turbine array.\n(a) The ideal flow field arising from an abstract array of deflectors of length $L$ oriented at an angle of attack of 40$^\\circ$. \nThe flow corresponds to an array deflecting the flow with no energy extraction.\n$Q_0$ is the deflected-flow strength, between the two extreme streamlines that pass through the array.\nInset shows a schematic of discrete deflectors and turbines;

No Energy conversion with bound vorticity alone}\nThe asymptotic far-field velocity due to the bound vorticity distribution is \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 25421, "prevtext": "\nWe use a consistent color scheme in Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower} to represent weak and strong deflection limits in red and blue respectively.\n\nIn our configuration, the flow reduction occurs for two reasons.\nThe first is due to resistance offered to the flow by the turbine array, which causes more fluid to flow around the turbine array.\nAs resistance from the actuator disk is the cause of flow reduction in the {LBJ}~analysis, we expect the quantitative contribution of this mechanism of flow reduction to be the similar.\nIn the {LBJ}~analysis the flow reduction is $Q/Q_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+V/U\\right)$, plotted as a dashed black line in Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower}~(b).\n\nWe implicitly neglect any losses due to the space between individual turbines.\nIndeed the expected flow reduction for our array at the weak deflection limit, the uppermost red line plotted in Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower}, is close (but not identical) to the {LBJ}~line.\nThis similarity between our flow reduction factor and that of {LBJ}, arises from the similarity of our procedure for determining efficiency using an energy balance on a volume defined by two streamlines shedding vorticity.\n\nThe second reason for flow reduction is the development of recirculation regions at the edges of the array.\nA detailed characterization of the size of the recirculation regions is presented in SI \\S 5.\nAs the recirculation regions are small but finite in the limit of weak deflection, the flow reduction factor, $Q/Q_0$ differs only slightly from the {LBJ}~case (the difference between the red and black lines).\nIn the case of strong deflection, the influence of the turbine array resistance on size of the recirculation regions is stronger. \nTherefore, the flow through the array is lower than the {LBJ}~case (lines of increasing blue intensity in Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower}~(b)).\n\nThe dependence of the array efficiency $\\eta$ on $V/U$ is also plotted in Figure

the efficiency of the array at extracting the impinging energy.\n\nA bound on the array power density can be obtained by recognizing that, by definition, $\\eta \\le {\\eta_\\text{max}}$, and which upon substitution into {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ca}}}} leads to {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}}.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\subsection{Increase in deflected-flow strength outweighs drop in turbine efficiency}\n\nThe array power density in {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}} has opposing dependences on the flow deflection and turbine efficiency. \nOn one hand, the maximum possible efficiency of energy conversion, shown in the inset of Figure \\ref{fig:FlowPower}~(a), decreases with the deflected-flow strength.\nBut on the other hand, the stronger the deflected flow, the more kinetic energy impinges on the turbines in the array.\nArray power density is effected more strongly by the order of magnitude increase of impinging kinetic energy due to deflection than the decrease in array efficiency from  ${ 0.57}$  to ${ 0.39}$.\nTherefore, larger array power densities are possible if the bound vorticity in the deflector-turbine array can be reinforced and greater flow deflected, without influencing the free vorticity.\nIn other words, an optimal value for the deflected-flow strength does not emerge as part of our analysis; \nthe greater the deflected-flow strength without flow separation, the higher can the array power density be.\n\n\n\\subsection{Methods for flow deflection} \n\nOur results, because of their basis in vorticity dynamics, are agnostic to the specific deflecting and energy converting mechanisms employed in the array.\nFor manipulating the flow, the most obvious candidates we present is an array of airfoil-shaped deflector plates interspersed with the turbines. \nA host of other techniques, such as turbines oriented at an angle to the flow \\cite{Wagenaar2012,Fleming2014,Churchfield2015}, or foils oscillating asymmetrically about their mean positions, to vector its wake at an angle to the free stream are conceivable.\nThe underlying essential principle is that the turbine array introduce the appropriate bound and free vorticity.\n\n{Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}} shows that the bound on array power density depends on the ability of the array to deflect the flow with minimal introduction of free vorticity.\nHigh-lift aerodynamic surfaces are ideal candidates for this purpose because they are designed to introduce the highest bound vorticity in the flow without significant flow separation.\nThese surfaces can lead to a lift coefficient of up to 4.5 \\cite{Smith1973,Liebeck1978,Lin1997}, which implies bound vorticity equivalent to a flat plate at an approximately 40$^\\circ$ angle of attack.\nUsing these as reference deflectors to estimate the maximum array energy density that can be realized with current technology, we substitute $\\alpha=40^\\circ$ in {Eq.~\\textbf{\\ref{{eqn:ourlimit}}}} and obtain ${C_A} = { 0.30}$.\nThis result is plotted in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Applications to hydrokinetic power}\nOne of the direct applications of our approach is an unconventional configuration for tidal and riverine turbine arrays -- \none in a vertical plane oriented parallel to the flow as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(c).\nIn a water stream with 1.5 m/s flow speed, our estimate for the dimensional array energy density is ${506}$ W/m$^2$ (${C_A}=0.3$) compared to 4.6 W/m$^2$ (${C_A}=2.7 \\times 10^{-3}$) arising from turbulent mixing in a large conventional array, or 20 W/m$^2$ arising in smaller arrays (${C_A} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$).\n\n\n\nIn addition to the higher energy density, the unconventional configuration offers several practical advantages.\nThe array makes efficient use of the space, by allowing other uses of the water body and keeping navigational channels open.\nEqually importantly, this configuration allows turbines to span the whole depth of the water column.\nThis possibility implies that only turbine blades or hydrofoils need to be submerged under water, and other mechanical and electrical components may be housed above the surface of water. Operating the drive-train, generators, and interconnecting cables above water reduces the initial installation costs by eliminating the need for marinization, and the operations and maintenance cost by providing easy access.\nWhile a detailed techno-economic analysis is beyond the scope of this article, the results presented here provide an integral component needed to perform cost-benefit analysis of incorporating flow deflection in hydrokinetic turbine arrays. \n\nIn our analysis, we have ignored the presence of any boundaries on the fluid domain, due to the simplicity it provides for analysis and our focus on the essential principles.\nFor an array length comparable with the channel width, the presence of boundaries will influence the flow and the performance of the array.\nHowever, for arrays shorter than channel width, the influence of the boundaries can be neglected, and our analysis is applicable.\nThe neglect of boundaries is not a fundamental limitation of our approach or our analysis.\nBoundaries can be incorporated using the method of images or boundary integral methods for potential flow to obtain improved bounds and to better design the array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Possible extensions and future directions}\nThe extension of our framework to three-dimensional flows requires incorporating the more general vorticity dynamics.\nJust as lifting line theory for three-dimensional wings is based on the two-dimensional Kutta-Joukowsky relation between bound vorticity and airfoil lift, our results in two dimensions provide the foundation for such an extension to three dimensions.\nFurthermore, unsteadiness and turbulence in the flow, the role of fluid viscosity, presence of shear in the freestream, the presence of ground and other boundaries, and the discrete nature of the array will reduce the performance below the limits we present here.\nWe have also not accounted for gravity, the free interface, and bed friction for the hydrokinetic application.\nAs can be seen from Figure \\ref{fig:Schematic}~(d), a $5^\\circ$ deflection of the flow leads to equal or greater ${C_A}$ than due to turbulent mixing.\nTherefore, we expect the influence of deflection greater than $5^\\circ$ to overwhelm the influence of turbulence.\nThese effects could be examined more carefully by embedding the deflector-turbine array in a larger computational fluid dynamics model and through controlled experiments.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe presented systematic flow manipulation as a strategy to deflect untapped kinetic energy towards a device array consisting of flow deflectors and turbines.\nWe use the framework of inviscid fluid dynamics to decompose the effects of array on fluid flow into deflection, captured in bound vorticity, and energy extraction, captured by shed vorticity. \nThe results calculated here represent upper bounds on performance that are agnostic to the specific technology at the array.\n\nUsing the array to impose deflection on the fluid flow can provide an order of magnitude increase in array power density from that achieved by existing arrays.\nThe large gain in kinetic energy deflected onto the array (deflected-flow strength) outweighs the small decrease in array's efficiency at extracting that energy (from { 57}\\% - { 39}\\%) due to increased recirculation.\nWe expect the essential ingredients of this analysis to inform more complicated methods of flow deflection and three-dimensional situations.\n\nFuture investigations building on this analysis will help evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{2mm}\n\\noindent\n{\\bf Acknowledgments} \\\\\nWe acknowledge support from the DOE ARPA-E grant DE-AR0000318 for this work. \n\n\n\n\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centerline{\n\\includegraphics[width=155mm]{Figures/Summary}\n} \n\\caption{\nThe motivation behind, the flow field arising from, and the performance of an abstract deflector-turbine array.\n(a) The ideal flow field arising from an abstract array of deflectors of length $L$ oriented at an angle of attack of 40$^\\circ$. \nThe flow corresponds to an array deflecting the flow with no energy extraction.\n$Q_0$ is the deflected-flow strength, between the two extreme streamlines that pass through the array.\nInset shows a schematic of discrete deflectors and turbines;

Calaf, et al, (2010)} \\cite{Calaf2010}:\nThe article simulates the fully developed wind turbine atmospheric boundary layer for pressure-gradient-driven flow around a rectangular array of turbines.\nPeriodic boundary conditions in both streamwise and spanwise direction imply simulation of an infinite array. \nThe turbines are modeled as actuator disks.\nThe spacing between turbines is 7.85 diameters in the streamwise and 5.23 in the spanwise direction.\nThe power extracted by the turbines per unit ground area is presented in terms of the friction velocity $u_*$ to be ${\\dot{W}}/{A_\\text{array}}=4.93/\\rho u_*^3$.\nThe wind speed at hub height in the absence of the turbines is $U=$17.3$u_*$, and it varied from 15.9$u_*$ to 18.8$u_*$ over the actuator disk diameter.\nBased on this data, the mean ${C_A}$ is calculated to be $1.9 \\times 10^{-3}$. \nThe error in this estimate arises due to the variation of the wind speed over the actuator disk.\nUsing the extremes of the wind speed the range of ${C_A}$ is estimated to be between $1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $2.4 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\n{\\bf b. Miller, et al, (2015)} \\cite{Miller2015}: \nThe article simulates atmospheric flow on the national scale in the presence of wind turbines over 112,320 km$^2$ in Kansas. \nThey report a maximum vertical kinetic energy flux of 1.1 W/m$^2$ over a region of the wind farm away from the edges with a first to third quantile variation from 0.375 W/m$^2$ to 1.55 W/m$^2$.\nThey postulate that their results are independent of the size of the farm, and therefore this kinetic energy flux represents the limit on the power conversion by the wind turbines.\nThe distribution of mean wind speed at hub height is reported, and can be closely approximated by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu=8$ m/s and standard deviation $\\sigma=2.9$ m/s.\nWe use this distribution to determine the distribution of $U^3$, which enters the definition of ${C_A}$.\nThe mean $U^3$, where $U$ is a normally distributed random variable is $\\mu^3 + 3 \\mu \\sigma^2$ = 714 m$^3$/s$^3$.\nBased on this information, we estimate ${C_A} = 2.7 \\times 10^{-3}$ using the mean values.\nWe also remark that, in addition to turbulent transport, detailed atmospheric dynamics on the national scale were part of this simulation. \nParameters such as the wind speed at hub height varied with time, and so did the power production. \n\n\\noindent\n{\\bf c. Cal, et al, (2010)} \\cite{Cal2010}:\nThe article presents results from a wind-tunnel experiment simulating a $3\\times 3 $ array of wind turbines. \nThey report the vertical flux of kinetic energy, however, the array may not be large enough to simulate a fully developed boundary layer.\nThe wind speed, in the absence of energy conversion, at hub height was maintained at 7 m/s, and varied between 6.2 m/s and 7.3 m/s across the rotor diameter.\nUsing the vertical kinetic energy flux in to the array, and ignoring the power production by the turbines in the front of the array facilitates a quantification of the redirected kinetic energy flux that replenishes the wake deficit.\nBecause of the small size of the array, this case provides insight into any departure of the kinetic energy redirection from the fully developed cases described in the previous two cases.\nA vertical kinetic energy flux of 1.8 W/m$^2$ was estimated using particle image velocimetry. \nBased on this information, we estimate the mean ${C_A}=8.89 \\times 10^{-3}$, and using the variation of the wind speed across the rotor derive a range for ${C_A}$ from $8.0\\times 10^{-3}$ to $1.3 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n\n\\noindent\n{\\bf d.
