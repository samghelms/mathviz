The basic principle of an R-FOG is to measure, by using an external probe laser, the eigenfrequencies of two counter-propagating modes of a fiber ring cavity, their difference being proportional to the angular velocity of the device (Sagnac effect). Unlike the interferometric fiber optic gyroscope, which requires several hundreds of meters of fiber to reach the required sensitivity for inertial navigation, here, only a very short length (few tens of cm to few meters) of optical fiber is sufficient. While the first proof-of-principle of an R-FOG was made as early as 1983 \\cite{Meyer1983}, it has not led to any commercial application so far owing to several reasons, among which bias instabilities due to the Kerr effect in solid-core fibers. \n\nThe breakthrough of using bandgap guidance to trap light in a low-index core makes HC-PCFs promising candidates for building medium to high grade gyroscopes \\cite{Terrel2012}. Hollow-core (HC) fibers, where light propagates mostly in air, have the advantage of significantly reducing the Kerr effect, known as a strong limitation on the bias stability of the R-FOG \\cite{Kim2006}. These fibers exhibit reduced bulk scattering and detrimental effects (thermal fluctuations, mechanical stress and radiation effects) that create noise and dissipate signals \\cite{Blin2007,Zhao2014}, although new problems emerge due to surface scattering \\cite{Terrel2012, Wu2015}.\nA first demonstration of a R-FOG using a 7-cell core hollow-core photonic band gap (PBG) fiber has been published by Terrel et al \\cite{Terrel2012}. The achieved performances (bias stability around 1 deg/s) are still several orders of magnitude poorer than the one typical required for inertial navigation. Recently, Qiu et al. \\cite{Qiu2014} have reported a R-FOG based on standard PM fiber with a laser stabilized to an external resonator. The bias stability and angular random walk were 0.1 deg/hr and 0.008 deg/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{hr}}$, respectively. These interesting results are a promising sign that commercial R-FOG with navigation or tactical grade performance might be attainable in the near future. \n\nThe HC fibers investigated here are based on a Kagome lattice design. Unlike PBG guiding fibers, photons are confined inside Kagome HC fibers not by PBG but rather via a mechanism akin to Von Neumann-Wigner bound states within a continuum, in that the fiber guided modes cohabit with those of the cladding without notably interacting. This inhibited coupling between the propagation mode and the surrounding silicate cladding structure is explained by the high degree of the transverse-field mismatch between the core and the cladding modes. The mode power fraction propagating in glass is reported to be below 0.05\\% \\cite{Couny2007,Humbert2004}, which is about two orders of magnitude lower compared to typical values (few percents) for PBG fibers. As a result of this weak interaction between the core and cladding modes, Kagome HC-PCFs exhibit broad transmission regions with relatively low loss covering the spectral range from IR to UV, and open new potentialities for many applications \\cite{Wang2013,Debord2014}, in particular for rotation sensing with a weak Kerr effect, and potential reduction of backscattering.\n\nIn this paper, we present experimental results on an Inhibited-Coupling (IC) guiding Kagome HC-PCF based resonator for rotation sensing applications. In particular, by using a simple semi-bulk cavity design, different HC fibers are characterized and investigated to compare their performances for gyroscope application. Two figures of merit are defined to evaluate them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Fundamental limits in R-FOGs}\\label{sec02}\nUltimately,if we assume that all effects related to laser noise, backscattering, mechanical and thermal drifts, etc. are avoided, the noise performance of the R-FOG is limited by the shot-noise limit (SNL). The latter can be made in principle arbitrarily small by increasing the intra-cavity power, but this will in return increase non-linear effects within the fiber, such as Kerr effect, leading to bias instalility. Consequently, a trade-off must be made between signal-to-noise ratio and nonlinear effects, which we study in this section in the case of hollow-core fibers.\n\n\\subsection{Shot-noise sensitivity limit}\nThe frequency difference $\\Delta f$ between the two counter-propagating modes of the R-FOG cavity is given by:\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta f=\\frac{4 A}{\\lambda L}\\dot{\\theta}\\ ,\\label{eq01}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\Delta f=\\frac{4A}{\\lambda L}\\dot{\\theta}\\ ,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0394</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>\u03bb</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>L</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03b8</mi><mo>\u02d9</mo></mover></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02899.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\delta f_{\\mathrm{min}}$ is the minimum measurable value of the frequency difference $\\Delta f$, $\\Gamma$ and $\\alpha$ are respectively the cavity resonance linewidth and contrast.

However, we can see that for the Kagome fiber, which presents the largest mode field diameter and the lowest mode power fraction inside silica, the bias of the R-FOG becomes almost insensitive to any power difference between the two counter propagating beams. Differently, when the mode field diameter is small like for a standard fiber or a seven-cell hollow core PBG fiber, the condition on the relative power difference between the two modes inside the cavity becomes mores stringent. Of course, if the intra-cavity power is larger than 1 mW, the relative power difference $\\Delta P/P$ in Table~\\ref{table01} is reduced accordingly. Thus there is a trade-off between increasing the optical power to reduce the shot noise limit and the acceptable relative power difference for the Kerr effect.

However, all-HC-fiber couplers are not yet available and splicing a HC fiber to a standard fiber \\cite{Terrel2012} induces high splicing losses and   backreflection. Like in reference \\cite{Sanders2006}, we choose to build a test cavity based on free space couplers (see Fig.~\\ref{Fig01}), with mirrors at 45$^{\\circ}$ incidence acting as input and output couplers. Lenses L$_2$ and L$_3$ are used to couple light in and out of the fiber. \n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\columnwidth]{Fig01.pdf}}\n\\caption{Experimental setup.}\\label{Fig01}\n\\end{figure}\nThis semi-bulk design allows for an easy optimization of the mirrors transmission to get as close as possible to the so-called critical coupling (mirror transmission equal to the cavity internal losses), which maximizes the contrast of the resonances. The free space section of the cavity also allows to insert birefringent elements to control the overall cavity polarization eigenstates, without using polarization maintaining fiber. One can then obtain a stable single polarization resonance. \n\n\\section{Kagome HC-PCF design and properties}\\label{sec04}\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{Fig02.pdf}}\n\\caption{SEM pictures of the (a) Kagome `A' fiber, (b) Kagome `B' fiber, and (c) 7-cell PBG fiber used here.}\\label{Fig02}\n\\end{figure}\nTwo HC Kagome fibers [see Figs.\\,\\ref{Fig02}(a,b)] have been designed, fabricated, and tested into the cavity, and compared to a 7-cell HC PBG fiber [see Fig.\\,\\ref{Fig02}(c)]. The fibers parameters, length, attenuation at 1.55 $\\mu$m, mode field diameter at $1/e^2$ (MFD), fraction of mode power in silica $\\eta$, and the overall coupling efficiency $P_{\\mathrm{out}}/P_{\\mathrm{in}}$ which takes into account coupling into the fiber and the propagation losses are summarized in Table \\ref{table02}.\n\nThe Kagome fibers labeled `A' and `B' exhibit hypocycloid contour with negative curvature parameters $b=0.8$ and $0.74$ respectively (see \\cite{Debord2013} for the definition of $b$), and silica strut thicknesses of 1250~nm and 480~nm, respectively. The fractions $\\eta$ of mode power in silica cladding were calculated for the three fibers as displayed in Table \\ref{table02}. \n\n\\section{Experimental setup and results}\\label{sec05}\nWe use a narrow band ($\\simeq$10 kHz) fiber-coupled single-frequency polarized laser operating at 1.55 $\\mu$m (see Fig. \\ref{Fig01}). The laser frequency is linearly swept to probe the resonances of the fiber resonator. The resonator is formed by two free-space mirrors (M$_1$, M$_2$), of 90 \\% and 98.5 \\% reflectivity, respectively. The total cavity length is equal to the sum of the fibre length and the free space path. Coupling into the fiber is performed with a pair of antireflection coated aspheric lenses (L$_2$, L$_3$) allowing a good matching between the external laser mode and the fiber mode field. The tested fibers are wound on a 15-cm-diameter coil. Two photodetectors (PD$_1$, PD$_2$) are used to respectively monitor both the transmitted and reflected intensities \\cite{Fsaifes2015}.\n\n\n\\begin{table}[]\n\n\n\n\\caption{Properties of the fibers tested here.}\n\\label{table02}\n\\centering\n\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nFiber & Length  & Losses & MFD & $\\eta$  & $P_{\\mathrm{out}}/P_{\\mathrm{in}}$ \\\\\n &  (m) &(dB/km) & ($\\mu$m) & (\\%) & (\\%) \\\\\n\\hline \nKagome A & 2.4 & 80 & 40 & $5.0\\times\u00d710^{-2}$ & 91\\\\\n\\hline \nKagome B & 2.3 & 60 & 34 & $2.0\\times\u00d710^{-3}$ & 85\\\\\n\\hline \n7-cell PBG & 19 & 22 & 7.7 & 6 & 70\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n \n The cavity resonance peaks recorded in reflection on PD$_1$ are shown in Fig. \\ref{Fig03}. The HC Kagome fiber A gives the best results in terms of contrast (89 \\%) and finesse (33) compared to the Kagome B (78 \\% and 21) and the 7-cell PBG (50 \\% and 9) fibers. The Kagome A and B fibers have roughly the same lengths (FSRs equal to 106 and 109 MHz, respectively), while in the case of the 7-cell PBG fiber, we had to take a much longer fiber (FSR = 15.5 MHz) in order to get a cavity linewidth in the MHz range. This is due to a lower coupling efficiency in this latter case. For the Kagome A fiber, the ratio between the input and output power through the fiber is ~91 \\% so that after taking into account propagation losses (about 6 \\%) and lenses losses (about 1 \\%), the total losses that can be attributed to free-space to fiber coupling are about 2 \\%. For the 7-cell PBG hollow core fiber, because of its small mode field diameter (MFD) of  8 $\\mu$m, the coupling efficiency is only about 70 \\%, so by taking into account propagation losses (about 9 \\%) and lenses losses (about 1 \\%), the total losses attributed to free-space to fiber coupling are about 20~\\%. \n \nAs mentioned in section \\ref{sec02}, using quarter- and half-wave plates in the free space section of the cavity, associated with an optimized orientation of the fiber end, allows to obtain a single resonance peak for all the fibers. This demonstrates the possibility to select a single spatial and polarization mode, despite the fact that the fibers were not specifically designed to be polarization maintaining. This single mode behavior is of outmost importance for gyroscope operation and was associated with a good stability of the finesse and contrast of the cavity, especially considering the fact that no special care was taken to isolate the cavity from mechanical vibrations and thermal fluctuations.\n \n \\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\columnwidth]{Fig03.pdf}}\n\\caption{Evolution of the intensity reflected by the cavity versus time for (a) Kagome A, (b) Kagome B, (c) 7-cell PBG fiber.

This is due to the better coupling efficiency demonstrated with the Kagome fibers that somehow compensates for the higher propagation losses. These results illustrate also the fact that the propagation losses are not the only parameter to take into account when choosing a fiber and that the coupling efficiency into the fiber and the fiber-to-fiber coupling efficiency are also primordial to get a high cavity performance. However, when comparing the figure of merit for the Kerr effect limit, the Kagome fibers seem more attractive than the PBG fiber. This would be even more so with Kagome fibers with lower loss figures such as the one reported in \\cite{Debord2013}.\n\nWith the Kagome A fiber, assuming a cavity diameter of $D = 7$ cm, $\\lambda = 1.55\\;\\mu$m, and $P_{\\mathrm{det}} = 1$ mW, the shot noise limit is about $0.004\\;^{\\circ}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{hr}}$, which is compatible with inertial navigation requirement. In such a fiber, Kerr effect induced bias become completely negligible.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe have experimentally investigated the use of a Kagome hollow-core photonic crystal fiber based resonator for rotation sensing applications, more particularly for resonant fiber optic gyroscopes.  \n\nThis work stresses the fact that, for an optimized design of an R-FOG, fibers with low propagation losses, high input coupling efficiency, and single spatial and polarization mode are required. Contrary to PBG HC fiber, Kagome HC fibers exhibit a relatively large core size, a very low spatial overlap of the core mode with the silica core-wall, and a coupling efficiency easily exceeding 95 \\%. Despite the fact we used Kagome fibers with higher loss figures than that of PBG fiber, these attributes make hollow core fibers based on Kagome lattice design a good candidate for resonant fiber-optic gyroscopes, especially from the point of view of Kerr effect induced bias. However, further studies are required to investigate the role of backscattering \\cite{Ma2011,Terrel2012,Wu2015} and modal purity in resonators based on Kagome fibers, and also to improve the cavity ruggedness by connectorizing or splicing HC fibers with limited losses.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\nThis work is supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (Project PHOBAG: ANR-13-BS03-0007 and PhotoSynth: ANR-11-CHEX-0009) and the European Space Agency (ESA).\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\n\n\n\n\\bibitem{Meyer1983} R.

However, we can see that for the Kagome fiber, which presents the largest mode field diameter and the lowest mode power fraction inside silica, the bias of the R-FOG becomes almost insensitive to any power difference between the two counter propagating beams. Differently, when the mode field diameter is small like for a standard fiber or a seven-cell hollow core PBG fiber, the condition on the relative power difference between the two modes inside the cavity becomes mores stringent. Of course, if the intra-cavity power is larger than 1 mW, the relative power difference $\\Delta P/P$ in Table~\\ref{table01} is reduced accordingly. Thus there is a trade-off between increasing the optical power to reduce the shot noise limit and the acceptable relative power difference for the Kerr effect. From this analysis, we can define a second figure of merit for the Kerr effect induced bias: \n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nFOM_{\\mathrm{Kerr}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta}\\ .\\label{eq06}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"FOM_{\\mathrm{Kerr}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta}\\ .\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>O</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>Kerr</mi></msub></mrow><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+5pt\"><mfrac><mi>\u03c3</mi><mi>\u03b7</mi></mfrac></mpadded></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
