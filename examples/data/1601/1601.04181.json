We use the molecular transfer model (MTM), which is currently the only method that accomplishes this goal albeit phenomenologically, to quantitatively describe urea-dependent folding of PDZ domain, which plays a significant role in molecular recognition and signaling. Experiments show that urea-dependent unfolding rates of the PDZ2 domain exhibit a downward curvature at high urea concentrations ($[C]$s), which has been interpreted by invoking the presence of a sparsely populated high energy intermediate.  Simulations using the MTM and a coarse-grained Self-Organized Polymer (SOP) representation of PDZ2 are used to show that the intermediate ($I_{EQ}$), which  has some native-like character, is present in equilibrium both in the presence and absence of urea. The free energy profiles as a function of the structural overlap order parameter show that there are two barriers separating the folded and unfolded states. Structures of the transition state ensembles, ($TSE1$ separating the unfolded and $I_{EQ}$ and $TSE2$ separating $I_{EQ}$ and the native state), determined using the $P_{fold}$ method, show that $TSE1$ is greatly expanded while $TSE2$ is compact and native-like. Folding trajectories reveal that PDZ2 folds by parallel routes. In one pathway folding occurs exclusively through $I_1$, which resembles $I_{EQ}$. In a fraction of trajectories, constituting the second pathway, folding occurs through a combination of $I_{1}$ and a kinetic intermediate. We  establish that the radius of gyration ($R_g^{U}$) of the unfolded state is more compact (by $\\sim$ 9\\%) under native conditions. Theory and simulations show that the decrease in $R_g^{U}$ occurs on the time scale on the order of utmost $\\sim$ 20 $\\mu s$. The modest decrease in $R_g^{U}$ and the rapid collapse suggest  that high spatial and temporal resolution, currently beyond the scope of most small angle X-ray scattering experiments,  are needed to detect compaction in finite-sized proteins. The present work further establishes that MTM is efficacious in producing nearly quantitative predictions for folding of proteins under conditions used to carry out experiments.       \n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section*{\\Large{Introduction}}\n\nThe Molecular Transfer Model (MTM) \\cite{O'Brien08PNAS},\nbased on  the statistical mechanical theory of liquid mixtures  \\cite{Liu12JPCB},\nis currently the only available computational method that  predicts the outcomes of\nexperiments and provides the  structural basis of folding as a function of denaturants \\cite{Reddy12PNAS,Reddy15JPCB} and pH \\cite{OBrien12JACS}.\nUsing the MTM in conjunction with coarse-grained (CG) representation of polypeptide chains\nwe have made quantitative predictions of the folding thermodynamics and kinetics as a function of\ndenaturants for a number of small (protein L, cold shock protein, srcSH3 domain, and Ubiquitin) \\cite{O'Brien08PNAS,Liu12JPCB,Reddy15JPCB,Chen14PCCP},\n and GFP, a large single domain proteins \\cite{Reddy12PNAS}.  Because the effects of denaturants are\ntaken into account naturally within the MTM framework \\cite{Liu12JPCB},  albeit phenomenologically\nit has been possible to obtain chevron plots for src SH3  domain producing quantitative agreement\nwith experiments for the slopes of folding and unfolding arms \\cite{Liu11PNAS}. Although MTM can be be implemented in conjunction with atomically detailed simulations we have so far used CG models for proteins. The virtue of CG models \\cite{Tozzini05COSB,Hyeon11NatComm,Elber11inbook,Whitford12RepProgPhys} is that they can be used to obtain both\nthe thermodynamic and kinetic properties over a a wide range of external conditions,\nthus allowing us to compare with experiments directly \\cite{Thirumalai13COSB}.\nThese studies illustrate that simulations based on the MTM provide concrete predictions for {\\it in vitro}  experiments enabling us to  go beyond generic ideas  used to understand  protein  folding  \\cite{Kim90AnnRevBiochem,Wolynes95Science,Dill97NSB,Daggett03TIBS,Onuchic04COSB,Dill08ARB,Schuler08COSB,Shakhnovich06ChemRev,Thirumalai10ARB,Dill12Science,Piana14COSB}.\nHere, we investigate the folding mechanism of PDZ2 domain using CG simulations within the theoretical framework of the MTM.\n\n\nPDZ domains are a large family of globular proteins that mediate\nprotein-protein interactions and play an important role in molecular\nrecognition\n\\cite{Harris01JCellSci,Kim04NatRevNeurosci,Jemth07Biochem}. These\nproteins generally consist of $80-100$ amino acids.   PDZ2 domain has six $\\beta$ strands and two $\\alpha$\nhelices (Figure 1a). The folding mechanism of PDZ2, with 94 residues, has been studied experimentally\n\\cite{Gianni05PEDS} using classical chemical kinetics methods. The key findings in these experiments are: (i) In urea-induced equilibrium denaturation experiments, the observed\ntransition is cooperative, which is well described by an\napparent two-state model \\cite{Gianni05PEDS,Sicorello09BJ}. (ii) In a majority of cases proteins that fold thermodynamically in a two-state manner also exhibit a similar behavior kinetically in ensemble experiments. However, urea-dependent unfolding rates exhibit a downward curvature at high urea concentrations at pH $>$ 5.5. Based on the observation that the\nfolding kinetics is mono-phasic, with no detectable burst phase in the initial fluorescence of the initial unfolding time course, it was surmised that there is no low energy intermediate in the unfolding of PDZ2. Rather the data were used to suggest the presence of a high-energy on-pathway intermediate,\nwhich does not accumulate significantly in equilibrium \\cite{Gianni05PEDS}. (iii) The high energy intermediate is non-detectable under stabilizing conditions,  achievable in PDZ2 domain by addition of modest amount of sodium sulfate. Under these conditions PDZ2 folds thermodynamically and kinetically in a two-state manner. (iv) The structures of the two transition state ensembles were also inferred using measured $\\Phi$ values  as constraints in all atom molecular dynamics simulations \\cite{Gianni07PNAS}. Unlike the results summarized in (i)- (iii) the predicted structures of the transition state ensembles are not as conclusive for reasons explained later in this work. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to provide a comprehensive picture of folding of PDZ2, with potential implications for other single domain proteins,  we performed\nmolecular simulations of a coarse-grained off-lattice\nmodel with side chains \\cite{Hyeon11NatComm,Pincus08ProgMolBiolTranslSci} and used MTM\n \\cite{O'Brien08PNAS,Liu11PNAS,Reddy12PNAS} to account for for denaturant effects.  The free energy profiles as a function of the structural overlap\norder parameter at different urea concentrations,\n$[C]$, and temperature $T$ suggest that the folding mechanism of\nPDZ2  can be altered by changing the stability of the folded state.\n\n\n\nIn accord with experiments, we demonstrate directly the existence of the fleeting\n obligatory intermediate both in equilibrium ($I_{EQ}$) and  kinetics ($I_1$) \\cite{Ivarsson07JBC}. The structures of $I_{EQ}$ and $I_1$ are similar. However, the\nfraction of molecules in intermediate basin of\nattraction (IBA),$f_{IBA}$,\n as a function of temperature and\n$[C]$ is small, thus explaining  the difficulty in detecting it\n in standard denaturation experiments. In addition to  $I_1$\na kinetic intermediate, $I_2$, is consistently populated in $\\sim$ 53\\% of the folding trajectories. Guided by the free energy profiles, we identified two transition state ensembles, $TSE1$ and $TSE2$. The\ncomputed values of the Tanford-like $\\beta$ parameters, using the solvent accessible surface area as a surrogate, for the two\ntransition state ensembles (one connecting the NBA and the IBA and\nthe other involving transition between the IBA and the UBA) are in\nqualitative agreement with those obtained from\nexperiments \\cite{Gianni05PEDS,Ivarsson07JBC}.  The current work\nfurther establishes that simulations based on the MTM are\nefficacious in providing a nearly quantitative picture of folding of\nsingle domain proteins.\n\n\\section*{\\Large{METHODS}}\n\n\\textbf{SOP-sidechain model}: The simulations were carried out using a CG model in\nwhich the $C_{\\alpha}$-based self-organized polymer (SOP)\nrepresentation\\cite{Hyeon06Structure} was augmented to include\nside chains (SCs)\\cite{Liu11PNAS,Liu12JPCB}. In the \nSOP-SC model each\nresidue is represented by two interaction centers, one that is\nlocated at the C${_\\alpha}$ position and the other  at the center\nof mass of the side chain. In the SOP-SC model the native state\nstabilization is achieved by accounting for backbone-backbone (bb),\nside chain-side chain (ss), and backbone-side chain (bs) interactions present in the folded state.

The melting temperature, identified with\nthe peak in $C_v(T)$,  is $T_m=324K$. The value of $T_m$ obtained in\nour simulations is in excellent agreement with the experimentally\nmeasured $T_m=321K$ \\cite{Ivarsson08PEDS}.  \n\nIn order to identify the $NBA$, $UBA$, and the intermediate basin of attraction ($IBA$) representing the $I_{EQ}$ state, we  plot in Figure 1c the free energy ($G(\\chi)$)\nprofile as function of $\\chi$ at  $T_m=324K$. All the conformations can be\nclassified into three states specified by the black vertical lines based on the $\\chi$ values.\n If $\\chi \\leq \\chi_c^N = 0.64$, the \nconformations are in the NBA, conformations with  $\\chi \\geq\n\\chi_c^D =0.825$ belong to the UBA, and  the rest of the\nconformations are in the  IBA. The fractions of\nmolecules in the $NBA$, $f_{NBA}([0],T)$ (the\nfirst argument shows the value of the denaturant concentration), in\nthe $UBA$ $f_{UBA}([0],T)$, and in the $IBA$, $f_{IBA}([0],T)$ as a function of\ntemperature are plotted in Figure 1d. Both $f_{NBA}([0],T)$ and\n$f_{UBA}([0],T)$ show that the folding or unfolding is\ncooperative. The value of $f_{IBA}([0],T)$ is negligible compared to\n$f_{NBA}([0],T)$ and $f_{UBA}([0],T)$, suggesting that from a\nthermodynamic perspective a  two-state description is adequate,\nreflecting the cooperative transition in the heat capacity curve\n(Figure 1b). The sparse population of the $IBA$  explains why the $I_{EQ}$\n state is hard to detect in experiments although its\npresence appears as a shoulder in the free energy profile (Figure\n1c). The value of $T_m$ computed using $f_{NBA}(T_m) = 0.5$ yields\n$T_m = 324K$, which coincides with the peak in the heat capacity\n(Figure 1b).\n\n\\textbf{Chemical Denaturation:}  Following our\nprevious studies \\cite{O'Brien08PNAS,Liu11PNAS,Reddy12PNAS}, we\nchoose a simulation temperature, $T_s$, at which the calculated free\nenergy difference between the  native state (N) and the\nunfolded state (U), $\\Delta G_{NU}(T_s)$ ($G_N(T_s)-G_U(T_s)$) and\nthe measured free energy $\\Delta G_{NU}(T_E)$ at $T_E$ (=298K)\ncoincide. The use of $\\Delta G_{NU}(T_s)=\\Delta G_{NU}(T_E)$ ( in\nwater with $[C]=0$ ) to fix $T_s$ is equivalent to choosing a\noverall reference energy scale in the simulations. For PDZ2, $\\Delta\nG_{NU}(T_E=298K)=-3.1 kcal/mol$ at $[C]=0$ \\cite{Sicorello09BJ},\nwhich results in $T_s=317K$. Besides the choice of $T_s$, {\\it no other\nparameter} is adjusted to obtain agreement with experiments for any property.\n\n\nWith $T_s=317K$ fixed, we calculated the\ndependence of $f_{NBA}([C],T_s)$, $f_{UBA}([C],T_s)$, and\n$f_{IBA}([C],T_s)$ on $[C]$ (Figure 2a). The agreement between the\nmeasured and simulated results for $f_{NBA}([C],T_s)$ as a function\nof  [C] is excellent (Figure 2a).  We find,\njust as in thermal denaturation, that $f_{IBA}([C],T_s)$ is small\n\\cite{Gianni05PEDS,Sicorello09BJ}. The midpoint concentration,\n$C_m$, obtained using $f_{NBA}([C_m],T_s)=0.5$ is [C]=2.3M, agrees\nwell with the experimentally measured value of 2.6M (see Figure 6D in \\cite{Sicorello09BJ}).\n\n\nThe native state stability with respect to U, $\\Delta\nG_{NU}([C])$($=G_N([C])-G_U([C])$), is computed using $\\Delta\nG_{NU}([C])=-k_BT_sln({f_{NBA}\\over f_{UBA}})$. The linear fit,\n$\\Delta G_{NU}([C])=\\Delta G_{NU}(0)+m[C]$, yields $\\Delta\nG_{NU}([0])=-3.09kcal/mol$ and $m=1.35kcal/mol\\cdot M$ (Figure 2b).\nThe experimentally inferred $m = 1.20kcal/mol\\cdot M$\ncompares well with the simulations, which establishes again\nthat simulations based on  MTM predict the  thermodynamic\nproperties  of proteins accurately.\nThe $[C]$-dependent heat capacity curves (Figure 2c)\nshow that the peaks corresponding to $T_m([C])$ decreases as $[C]$\nincreases (Figure 2c=d). Taken together the simulations\nshow that the  equilibrium folding induced by temperature or\ndenaturants is cooperative.\n\n{\\bf Urea-dependent changes in the shape of PDZ2:} The dependence of the radius of gyration, $\\langle R_g([C]) \\rangle$, on urea concentration (black line in Figure 3a) shows a transition from an expanded to a collapsed state as $[C]$ decreases. The radii of gyration of the $I_{EQ}$ and the native state are virtually constant at all urea concentrations. However, the radius of gyration of the $UBA$ decreases as $[C]$ decreases implying that the ensemble of structures of the unfolded state is more compact under native conditions than at 8M urea. The decrease in the $R_g$ of the $UBA$ structures in going from 8M urea to 1M is about 9\\%, which should be measurable in a high precision Small Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment (see below for additional discussion). The $P(R_g)$ distributions at various urea concentrations show the expected behavior (Figure 3b). The protein is largely in the $NBA$ at $[C]$ less than 2.3M (mid point of the folding transition)  and is expanded at higher values of $[C]$. The distance distributions, which can be measured as the inverse Fourier transform of the wave vector dependent scattering intensity, are plotted in Figure 3c and constitutes one of the predictions. \n\n\n\n\n{\\bf Free energy profiles, $G(\\chi)$, reveal lowly populated intermediate:} To illustrate how  urea changes the folding\nlandscape, we plotted $G(\\chi)$ versus $\\chi$ at different $[C]$ at $T=T_m=324K$ in Figure 4a and at\n$T=T_s=317K$ in Figure 4b.  Figure 4a shows, that at all urea\nconcentrations,  the conformations could be partitioned into\nthree states, which is consistent with the results in Figure 1c displaying $G(\\chi)$ at $T_m$ with $[C] = 0$. The basin of attraction\ncorresponding to $I_{EQ}$ becomes deeper as $[C]$\nincreases but is  shallow compared to the $NBA$ and $UBA$.  The barrier for $TSE1$ is  lower than for $TSE2$, implying that the transition from the intermediate states to the\nUBA is more facile than transition to the $NBA$. The number of distinct minima\nremain unchanged at the lower temperature, $T_s=317K$\n(Figure 4b). However, the basin for the intermediate states becomes\n shallower as $[C]$ increases, and the barrier for TSE1\nalmost disappears, especially when $[C]>C_m=2.3M$, which indicates\nthat the intermediate, if it can be detected at all, is unstable. The absence of $I_{EQ}$ at the lower temperature suggests that stabilization of the native fold of PDZ2 leads to a two-state thermodynamic transition. Our finding supports the same observation in experiments showing that native state stabilization upon addition of sodium sulfate results in the high energy $I_{EQ}$ being undetectable. \n\n\\textbf{Structures of the transition state ensembles ($TSE1$ and $TSE2$):} We identified the\ntransition state structures using the folding trajectories generated  at $T_m$. We picked the  putative transition state from the barrier regions of the free energy\nprofile as a function of $\\chi$, using the conditions $ 0.815<\\chi <\n0.835$ for $TSE1$ and $ 0.63<\\chi < 0.65$ for $TSE2$, which are\nrepresented as shaded areas in Figure 1c.  Starting from these\nstructures, we calculated the commitment probability, $P_{fold}$, of\nreaching the $NBA$ \\cite{Du98JCP}. The sets of structures with $ 0.4 \\leqslant\nP_{fold} \\leqslant 0.6$ are identified as the transition state\nensemble. The characteristics of the two transition state ensembles are displayed in Figure 5a and the distribution of the structural order parameter $P(\\chi)$ of the $TSE1$ along with the contact map are shown in Figure 5b and Figure 5c, respectively. Distribution of $P(\\chi)$ and the structural details for $TSE2$ are shown in Figures 5d and 5e, respectively.\n\nThe  characteristics of the TSEs are experimentally described\nusing the Tanford $\\beta$ parameter. By fitting the  measured Chevron plots as linear function of $[C]$\nit has been shown that $\\beta_E^1=0.53$ for TSE1, and\n$\\beta_E^2=0.89$ for TSE2 \\cite{Gianni05PEDS} and $\\beta_E^1=0.35$\nfor TSE1 and $\\beta_E^2=0.85$ for TSE2 \\cite{Ivarsson07JBC}.  It is\ngenerally assumed that $\\beta$ is related to the buried solvent\naccessible surface area (SASA) in the transition state. For the\n$TSE$s obtained in our simulations, we calculated the distribution\n$P(\\Delta_R)$ (see Figure 5a), where\n$\\Delta_R=(\\Delta_U-\\Delta_{TSE})/(\\Delta_U-\\Delta_N)$ with\n$\\Delta_U$, $\\Delta_{TSE}$, $\\Delta_N$ being the SASAs  in the DSE\n($[C]=8.0M$), TSE, and the NBA ($[C]=0.0M$), respectively. We found\nthat the average $<\\Delta_R>=0.23=\\beta_s^1$ for $TSE1$ and\n$<\\Delta_R>=0.68=\\beta_s^2$ for $TSE2$, which qualitatively agree\n with the values inferred from experiments. The small value of $\\beta_1$ suggests that the $TSE1$ structures are more $UBA$-like whereas the $TSE2$ structures resemble the native state.\n\nThe structural details are revealed in Figure 5c, which shows the contact map for $TSE1$. It is clear\nthat relative to the native state (top half in Figure 5c) the extent to which\nthe structure is ordered in $TSE1$ is modest (green) to\nlow (blue). The contacts between $\\beta$ strands $1-6-4$ have\nlow formation probabilities as indicated by the two black circled\nregions.\nThe secondary structures, $\\beta_{23}$ and two helices, are ordered\nto a greater extent. A representative structure for $TSE1$ displayed  on\nthe left of Figure 5a  shows that the structure is expanded.\nOnly $\\beta_{23}$ and the two helices have relatively\nhigh formation probability. \n\nThe contact map for $TSE2$ (Figure 5e) shows that the formation \nprobabilities of contacts even between residues that are distant in sequence are high, which results in the ensemble of   TSE2 structures being \ncompact. The major blue region in the contact map\nindicates that $\\beta_{16}$ is still largely unstructured. Four\nsuperimposed representative structures from $TSE2$ are shown on the\nright of Figure 5a. The structures are native-like\nexcept that $\\beta$ strand 1 is not as well packed as in the native state. The lack of stabilizing interactions in \n$\\beta_{16}$ found in our simulations  disagrees with the inferences from the all atom \nmolecular dynamics simulations using measured $\\Phi$ values as constraints \\cite{Gianni07PNAS} (see below for additional discussion).\n\n\n\n\\textbf{Folding and collapse kinetics:} We calculated the collapse and folding rates at zero urea concentration from the \nfolding trajectories , which were generated from Brownian\ndynamics simulations \\cite{Veitshans97F&D}. From 93 folding trajectories, the fraction\nof unfolded molecules at time $t$, is computed using\n$P_u(t)=1-\\int_0^tP_{fp}(s)ds$, where $P_{fp}(s)$ is the\ndistribution of first passage times. We fit $P_u(t) = e^{-tk_f}$ (\nFigure 6a) with $k_f=172s^{-1}$, a value that is\nabout 60 times larger than found in the experiments ($2.8^{-1}$) \\cite{Gianni05PEDS}. The kinetics of collapse of PDZ2\ndomain, shows that $<R_g(t)>$ decays with a single rate\nconstant, $k_c([C])$, the rate of collapse. The extracted values of\n$k_c([C])=244s^{-1}$ from the data in Figure 6b is greater than\n$k_f([C])$, which shows compaction occurs ahead of folding. \n\n{\\bf Thermodynamic and kinetic intermediates:} Analyses\nof the folding trajectories show that the folded state is reached through a\nkinetic intermediate state, $I_1$ (Figures 7a, 7b, 7c, and 7d). This intermediate state, while not  directly detected\nin experiment, is likely responsible for the downward curvature observed in  the unfolding arm of the  chevon\nplots \\cite{Gianni05PEDS}. We also find the presence of another kinetic intermediate\nstates ($I_2$)\n in some  of the trajectories. A quantitative analyses allows us to classify the occurrence of $I_1$ and $I_2$ in the $93$ folding trajectories. \nIn $49$ trajectories both $I_1$ and $I_2$ are found.  Two\ntrajectories in which this occurs  are illustrated in Figures 7a and 7b.\nIn Figure 7a, PDZ2 samples  $I_1$ and $I_2$ only once before\nreaching the native state whereas in Figure 7b, it samples $I_1$ and $I_2$\nmore than once. In the second class  of trajectories ($44$ out of\n$93$) PDZ2 samples only the $I_1$ (see  Figures 7c and 7d for examples). Structures of $I_1$ and $I_2$ are displayed in Figure 7e.\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\bf $I_{EQ}$ and $I_1$ are structurally similar:}\nTo illustrate the structural similarity between $I_{EQ}$, identified in the free energy profiles (Figures 1 and 4), and $I_1$  in 100\\% of the kinetic folding trajectories, and $I_2$ sampled in some of the folding trajectories, we computed the  average fraction of native contacts formed by\nevery residue, $f_{Q}$, for the three states (Figures 8a and 8b).  The correlation between $I_{EQ}$ and $I_1$, shown in Figure 8c, is very\nhigh (R=0.995).   Therefore, we surmise that $I_1$ and $I_{EQ}$  are structurally identical. \n Quantitative results in Figures 8b and 8d and sample structures (Figure 8e) show that the  structure of $I_2$ differs from $I_{EQ}$. Taken together these results show that both thermodynamic and kinetic intermediates can be sampled during the folding process although the former is far more prevalent. \n\n\\section*{\\Large{Discussion:}}\n\n{\\bf Minimum Energy Compact Structures (MECS):} The folding trajectories reveal that two major intermediates are sampled as PDZ2 folds.  The equilibrium intermediate is found in all the trajectories whereas the kinetic intermediate is found in only a fraction of the trajectories. Two aspects of these findings, which are of general validity for folding, are worth pointing out. (i) Both $I_1$ and $I_2$ form on the time scale of collapse. In those trajectories in which $I_2$ forms there frequent transitions between $I_2$ and $I_1$ (see Figure 7). In the process of making such transitions PDZ2 undergoes considerable expansion.  (ii) The intermediates, $I_{EQ}$ and $I_1$, are compact and contain  native-like features. The major difference between $I_1$ and the folded state is in the extent of structure in $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_4$, and $\\beta_6$ as well as $\\alpha_2$. The structure of $I_1$ is similar to that found in $TSE1$, which follows from the Hammond postulate.    These intermediates, which are like MECS (minimum energy compact structures) \\cite{Camacho93PRL}  facilitate rapid folding. Although they are difficult to detect in ensemble experiments, single molecule pulling experiments using cycles of force increase and force quench can be used to detect MECS as has been done for Ubiquitin \\cite{Garcia-Manyes09PNAS}. It would be interesting to do similar experiments on PDZ2 to directly observe $I_1$ and $I_2$ using force as a perturbation.\n\n{\\bf Collapse and folding transition:}  Is the size of the polypeptide chain of the unfolded state under folding conditions ($[C] < C_m$)  less than at $[C] > C_m$?  Theoretical arguments \\cite{Camacho93PNAS,Ziv09JACS,Ziv09PCCP}, simulations \\cite{O'Brien08PNAS}, and a number of single molecule FRET and SAXS experiments \\cite{Schuler08COSB,Haran12COSB} have answered the question in the affirmative whereas some SAXS experiments on  protein L  suggest that there is no evidence for  polypeptide chain  collapse, which is manifestly unphysical. The arguments in favor of collapse preceding folding is based on the following observations. The random coil state of a polypeptide chain with $N$ residues is expected to be $R_g^{U} \\sim a_R N^{0.6}$ with $a_R \\approx$ 2.0\\AA. This estimate  is likely to be an upper bound because even 8M urea is not a good solvent because even at these elevated concentrations the unfolded state has residual structure. As the denaturant concentration decreases the maximum decrease in $R_g$ is likely to have a lower bound $a_D N^{0.5}$. It cannot be maximally compact because if it were so then enthalpic interactions would drive these structures to the folded state for which $R_g \\approx a_N N^{1/3}$ with $a_N$ =3.0\\AA \\cite{dima04JPCB}. Thus, we surmise that $  a_D N^{0.5} < R_g^{U} <   a_R N^{0.6}$. The reduction in $R_g$ of the unfolded state for $N= 64$ (protein L) is predicted to be between (5-10)\\% depending on the values of $a_R$ and $a_D$. In PDZ2 ($N = 94$) we find that the unfolded state $R_g$ decreases by only 9\\% as $[C]$ decreases (Figure 3a). Thus, due to finite $N$ resulting in a small decrease in the unfolded state $R_g$ requires high precision SAXS measurements to measure changes in $R_g^U$ as $[C]$ decreases. The errors in SAXS for protein L are far too large to accurately estimate $R_g^U$, especially under native conditions. \n\nThe absence of detectable contracted form of the polypeptide chain in time resolved SAXS experiments protein L was used as further evidence that compact states are not formed in the folding of any single domain protein. Using theory \\cite{deGennes85JPL,Pitard98EPL,Thirum95JPI} it can be shown that collapse of the unfolded state occurs on time scales on the order of $\\tau_c \\approx \\tau_0 N^{\\beta}$ where $\\beta$ is between 1.5 and 2.2, and $\\tau_0 \\approx \\mathcal O {10^{-9} s}$. For PDZ2  we estimate that $\\tau_c \\sim 20 \\mu s$. Our simulations show that the contraction of the unfolded state occurs on time scale that does not exceed a maximum of $\\approx 50 \\mu s$ (see the inset in Figure 6b). Theoretical estimate based on the scaling law above for collapse of the unfolded state of protein L ($N = 64$) a maximum of $\\tau_c \\sim 4 \\mu s$. Based on reconfiguration time measurements using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy \\cite{Nettels07PNAS,Soranno12PNAS} indicate that $\\tau_c$ for small proteins could be less by an order of magnitude compared to the theoretical estimate.  A larger value of $20 \\mu s$, much shorter than the folding time,  for reconfiguration time has also been reported for protein L \\cite{Waldauer10PNAS}. For the larger DHFR ($N = 154$) there is nearly a 23\\% reduction in $R_g^U$ in $\\sim 300 \\mu s$ \\cite{Arai07JMB}, which is also considerably shorter than the folding time. All the studies show that collapse of the unfolded state, which increases with $N$, is on the order of at most tens of $\\mu s$. Thus, we conclude that the time resolution in the most recent SAXS experiments on protein L (4 ms) \\cite{Yoo12JMB}, which is comparable to the folding time, is too long to shed light on compaction of the polypeptide chain. The presence of 15 His tags in the first study \\cite{Plaxco99NSB} makes it difficult to ascertain the relevance for protein L. Indeed, the inability to accurately determine determine the characteristics of the unfolded state had also lead to erroneous conclusions about equilibrium collapse and kinetic foldability \\cite{Millett02Biochem}, which has been corrected recently using smFRET experiments recently \\cite{Hofmann12PNAS}.  \n\nFast mixing experiments that simultaneously detect compaction and acquisition of structure on a number of proteins \\cite{Chan97PNAS, Akiyama02PNAS,Kimura05PNAS} have produced ample evidence that collapse is an integral process of the folding process, as predicted by theory. Although it is likely that the simplified analysis of smFRET measurements overestimates the extent of collapse \\cite{O'Brien09JCP}, fast mixing SAXS experiments  on a variety of proteins leave no doubt that the unfolded state is indeed more compact (albeit by only about $\\approx$ 9\\%) under native conditions despite persistent claims to the contrary based on SAXS data based largely on one protein (protein L) with large errors. It is a pity that the erroneous conclusion has resulted in unnecessary obfuscation. What is needed are high precision data for single domain proteins spanning a range of $N$ (say between 50-250), which cannot be easily obtained by  SAXS alone  \\cite{Trewhella13Structure} but is more readily available in smFRET experiments.\n\n{\\bf Detection of $I_{EQ}$ in PDZ2 in single molecule pulling experiments:} The downward curvature in the unfolding rate as a function $[C]$ in PDZ2 implies that an intermediate is populated \\cite{Gianni05PEDS}. Single molecule pulling experiments are well suited to explore this finding more readily.   Based on the free energy profile computed here and postulated elsewhere \\cite{Ivarsson07JBC}, we suggest that unfolding by mechanical force ($f$) would give rise to downward curvature in a plot of $log k_u(f)$ versus $f$. At low forces the inner barrier separating the $NBA$ and $I_{EQ}$ would dominate whereas at high forces the second outer barrier is relevant for mechanical unfolding. The two sequential barrier picture implies that there would be two transition state distances with a switch  between the two occurring as $f$ is increased. A plausible support for this argument comes from the observation that the Tanford $\\beta_T$ as a function of $[C]$ exhibits a sigmoidal behavior (see Figure 4 in \\cite {Ivarsson07JBC}) with $\\beta_T$ changing from 0.35 at low $[C]$ to 0.85 at high $[C]$. The scenario postulated here is distinct from that in SH3 domain in $[log k_u(f), f]$ plot exhibits an upward curvature, which is a signature of parallel unfolding pathways with a switch between the transition state ensembles \\cite{Guinn15NatComm} as opposed to the predicted sequential barrier model for PDZ2. Laser optical tweezer experiments are ideally suited to test our prediction. \n \n \n\n{\\bf Structures of the TSEs:} It is interesting to compare the structures of TSE1 and TSE2 obtained in this work with those reported earlier \\cite{Gianni07PNAS}. The structure of TSE1 (Figure 5) show interactions involving $\\beta_2$, $\\beta_3$, and formation of the two helices. This is  in sharp contrast to\nthe conclusion in  \\cite{Gianni07PNAS} suggesting that in TSE1 $\\beta$\nstrands $1-6-4$ are structured  whereas the other\nsecondary structural elements  are essentially disordered.  Although the agreement between the predicted structures in our work and those reported in \\cite{Gianni07PNAS} in TSE2 is better in that we find that it is native-like, there are crucial differences as well. In particular, the lack of stabilizing interactions involving \n$\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_6$ found in our simulations  disagrees with the inferences drawn from the all atom \nmolecular dynamics simulations using measured $\\Phi$ values as constraints \\cite{Gianni07PNAS}.  The differences are likely to be related to the completely different approaches used in the two studies. In \\cite{Gianni07PNAS} the measured $\\Phi$ values were used as constraints in standard all atom molecular dynamics simulations, which use inaccurate force fields. The procedure, while interesting, is not systematic in the sense the accumulation of errors both from the $\\Phi$ values as well as the MD simulations is nearly impossible to quantify. More importantly, the putative TSE structures were not used to obtain the $P_{fold}$ values in the earlier study \\cite{Gianni07PNAS}, which casts doubt on whether the identified TSEs accurately represent the actual TSEs. We believe additional experiments, including perhaps double mutant cycles, would be needed to ascertain the nature of the TSEs in PDZ2.    \n\n\\section*{\\Large{Concluding Remarks:}}\n\nWe have used a phenomenological theory based on the MTM to simulate the folding of PDZ2 domain as function of temperature and urea. In addition to providing support to the folding mechanism discovered in experiments \\cite{Gianni05PEDS}  we have made a few testable predictions. (1) We have obtained a precise dependence of the melting point as a function of urea concentration, which can tested using standard calorimetry experiments. (2) The presence of high energy intermediate in the absence of added salt can be characterized using single molecule pulling experiments as shown using simulations for srcSH3 domain \\cite{Zhuravlev14JMB} demonstrating that  the excited state is sparsely ($O \\approx {2-5)\\%}$ populated, which coincided with the findings based on NMR experiments \\cite{Neudecker12Science}. \n\n\n\n\\section*{\\Large{Acknowledgements}}\nWe are grateful to Ben Schuler and Gilad Haran for their interest and useful comments.

Such an approximation, whose validity for obtaining\nthermodynamic properties has been previously established \\cite{Liu11PNAS}, is used to obtain\nthermodynamic properties.\n\n\\textbf{ Langevin and Brownian Dynamics Simulations}:\nWe assume that the dynamics of the protein is governed by\nthe Langevin equation, which includes a damping term with a friction\ncoefficient $\\zeta$, and a Gaussian random force $\\Gamma$. The\nequation of motion for a generalized coordinate $r_i$ is\n$m\\text{\\\"{r}}_i=-\\zeta \\text{\\.{r}}_i +F_c+\\Gamma$ where $m$ is the\nmass of a bead, $F_c=-\\partial E_P(\\{r_i\\})/\\partial r_i$, is the\nconformational force calculated using Eq. (\\ref{eq:E_P}), $\\Gamma$\nis the random force with a white noise spectrum. The autocorrelation\nfunction for $\\Gamma(t)$ in the discretized form is\n$<\\Gamma(t)\\Gamma(t+nh)>={2\\zeta k_BT\\over h}\\delta_{0,n}$\n\\cite{Veitshans97F&D} where $\\delta_{0,n}$ is the Kronecker\ndelta function and $n = 0, 1, 2 \\ldots $. The value of the time\nstep, $h$, depends on the friction coefficient $\\zeta$.\n\nTo obtain enhanced sampling, we used the  Replica Exchange Molecular\nDynamics\n(REMD) \\cite{Eisenmenger96CPL,Okamoto95JPC,Zhou01PNAS,Sugita99CPL} to\nperform thermodynamics sampling using a low friction coefficient\n$\\zeta=0.05m/\\tau_L$ \\cite{Honeycutt92BP}, which allows us\nto accurately calculate the equilibrium properties.  Rapid convergence of thermodynamics is possible\nat a small $\\zeta$ (under damped limit) because the polypeptide chain makes frequent\ntransitions between all accessible states. In the low $\\zeta$ limit limit,\nwe used the Verlet leap-frog algorithm to integrate the equations of\nmotion. The velocity at time $t+h/2$ and the position at time $t+h$\nof a bead are given by,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nv_i(t+h/2) & = & {2m-h\\zeta\\over 2m+h\\zeta}\\cdot v_i(t-h/2)+{2h\\over 2m+h\\zeta}\\left[F_c(t)+\\Gamma(t)\\right] \\\\\nr_i(t+h)   & = & r_i(t)+h\\cdot v_i(t+h/2)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nIn order to simulate the kinetics of folding, $\\zeta$ is set to be\n$50m/\\tau_L$, which approximately corresponds to the value in water\nand represents the over damped limit \\cite{Veitshans97F&D}. In\nthe high $\\zeta$ value, we use the Brownian dynamics\nalgorithm \\cite{Ermak78JCP}, which allows us to integrate\nequations of motion using\n\n", "index": 7, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nr_i(t+h)=r_i(t)+{h\\over \\zeta}(F_c(t)+\\Gamma(t)).\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"r_{i}(t+h)=r_{i}(t)+{h\\over\\zeta}(F_{c}(t)+\\Gamma(t)).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>h</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mfrac><mi>h</mi><mi>\u03b6</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>c</mi></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u0393</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
