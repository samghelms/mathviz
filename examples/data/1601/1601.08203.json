In recent years, {\\it ab initio} approaches to nuclei\n  have taken the first steps towards tackling the computational\n  challenge of describing these phenomena from Hamiltonians with\n  microscopic degrees of freedom. This endeavor is now possible due to\n  ideas from effective field theories, novel optimization strategies\n  for nuclear interactions, {\\it ab initio} methods exhibiting a soft\n  scaling with mass number, and ever-increasing computational\n  power. This paper reviews some of the recent accomplishments. We\n  also present new results. The recently optimized chiral interaction\n  NNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ is shown to provide an accurate description of both\n  charge radii and binding energies in selected light- and medium-mass\n  nuclei up to $^{56}$Ni. We derive an efficient scheme for including\n  continuum effects in coupled-cluster computations of nuclei based on\n  chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces, and present new\n  results for unbound states in the neutron-rich isotopes of oxygen\n  and calcium. The coupling to the continuum impacts the energies of\n  the $J^\\pi = {1/2}^-,{3/2}^-,{7/2}^-,{3/2}^+$ states in\n  $^{17,23,25}$O, and -- contrary to naive shell-model expectations --\n  the level ordering of the $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+,{5/2}^+,{9/2}^+$ states\n  in $^{53,55,61}$Ca.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\submitted{\\PS}\n\n\\maketitle\n\nAtomic nuclei exhibit a variety of fascinating phenomena that -- on a\nmicroscopic level -- range from single-nucleon motion to the\ncollective behavior of practically all\nnucleons~\\cite{bohr1975nobel,mottelson1975nobel}. Many of these can be\nviewed as emergent phenomena, that is,  they are very difficult to derive\nfrom (or to understand from) the underlying microscopic Hamiltonian since \n they differ in scale and complexity from the fundamental\nconstituents. Here we broadly understand emergent properties as\nproposed  by Anderson~\\cite{anderson1972}: ``The ability to reduce\neverything to simple fundamental laws does not imply the ability to\nstart from those laws and reconstruct the universe...at each level of\ncomplexity entirely new properties appear, and the understanding of\nthe new behaviors requires research which I think is as fundamental in\nits nature as any other.''\n\nIn the physics of atomic nuclei, we mention the following examples of\nemergent phenomena: The long-range part of the nuclear interaction\nresults from pion exchange and is thus a consequence of the\nspontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD). Rotations are the lowest excited states in rare earth nuclei\nand actinides, as a consequence of the emergent breaking of rotational\nsymmetry~\\cite{bohr1975}. Pairing and nuclear\nsuperfluidity~\\cite{bohr1958} results from the emergent breaking of a\nunitary symmetry. In neutron-rich nuclei with ground states close to\nthe breakup thresholds, the interplay between pairing effects and the\ncoupling to the particle decay channels may cause Borromean properties\nand extended halo-like density distributions to emerge\n\\cite{tanihata1985,zhukov1993, tanihata2013}. Furthermore, the finely\ntuned saturation of atomic nuclei as self-bound finite quantum systems\nwith an approximately constant density can also be viewed as an\nemergent phenomenon. Indeed, an inspection of the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction would not suggest that nuclear matter saturates, but\nrepulsive three-nucleon forces (3NFs) combined with attractive\nnucleon-nucleon interactions achieve the feat\n\\cite{bogner2005,hebeler2011,ekstrom2015}. In this article, we also\nconsider phenomena that emerge in neutron-rich nuclei because these are\ninherently open quantum many-body systems with a strong coupling to\nthe particle continuum and decay channels. Weakly bound and unbound\nstates are most fascinating properties in neutron-rich nuclei, with\nsurprising effects on binding and shell structure.\n\nThese examples show that much of the rich structure of atomic nuclei\nis due to emergent phenomena. Not surprisingly, the microscopic\nunderstanding of emergent phenomena poses significant theoretical\nchallenges. We note that emergent phenomena are usually collective in\nnature and complex at the microscopic level. As a consequence, the\ncorresponding emergent properties (such as the values for the pion\nmass, nuclear moments of inertia, nuclear pairing gaps, the nuclear\nsaturation energy and density, the properties of halo states for the\nexamples given in the previous paragraph) are usually finely tuned and\ncannot be guessed from the ``natural'' sizes of the parameters of the\nunderlying microscopic Hamiltonians.\n\nLet us briefly comment on the microscopic approaches to emergent\nphenomena in nuclear physics.  Lattice QCD calculations are now\nreaching physical pion masses for certain\nobservables~\\cite{green2012,arthur2013,borsanyi2014}. However, there\nis disagreement whether nuclear binding\nincreases~\\cite{beane2013,barnea2015} or decreases~\\cite{inoue2015}\nwith increasing pion mass.  First {\\it ab initio} computations of\nrotational bands in $p$-shell and $sd$-shell nuclei have become\navailable very\nrecently~\\cite{caprio2013,maris2015,caprio2015,jansen2015,hergert2015}. Here,\nthe reproduction of moments of inertia for certain deformed $sd$-shell\nnuclei is very encouraging, while the accurate computation of\ntransition strengths from first principles is still an open\nproblem. {\\it Ab initio} computations of superfluid properties have\nalso been reported recently for nuclei in the oxygen and calcium\nregion~\\cite{soma2013b,signoracci2015}. Here, the accurate\nreproduction of pairing gaps and the restoration of particle number\nare challenges. Regarding nuclear saturation, only very few nuclear\ninteractions yield accurate binding energies and radii for\nlight~\\cite{carlson2015} and medium-mass nuclei~\\cite{ekstrom2015}\nthat are also consistent with the empirical saturation point in\nnuclear matter. In nuclei heavier than oxygen or so, there seems to be\na tremendous sensitivity to details of the nuclear interaction that\nare not probed in few-nucleon systems. Finally, the inclusion of\ncontinuum effects is essential for the level ordering of weakly bound\nand unbound states \\cite{hagen2012b,langhammer2015}, and the neutron\ndripline in exotic nuclei.\n\nThe microscopic approach to emergent nuclear pheneomena has become\npossible due to advances in computational nuclear physics. This is in\ncontrast to approaches based on nuclear models or effective field\ntheories (EFTs). In those approaches, the relevant (and often\ncollective) degrees of freedom are selected as a starting point, and\nemergent phenomena are encoded as parameters or low-energy\nconstants. Chiral EFT, for instance, provides us with interactions\nthat are consistent with the physics of low-energy QCD, and the pion\nmass and pion-nucleon interaction is taken from\ndata~\\cite{ordonez1992,vankolck1994,epelbaum2009,machleidt2011}. Collective\nmodels~\\cite{bohr1975,iachello1987} and EFTs of\nheavy atomic\nnuclei~\\cite{papenbrock2011,papenbrock2014,coelloperez2015b} are based\non bosonic degrees of freedom, with moments of inertia (or vibrational\nfrequencies) as input parameters and low-energy constants,\nrespectively.  Finally, saturation is built into the nuclear shell\nmodel by tuning the frequency of the oscillator basis\naccordingly~\\cite{brown1988,caurier2005}.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to review and discuss recent and new\nresults on emergent phenomena that now can be approached in {\\it ab\n  initio} coupled-cluster computations of atomic nuclei. The article\nis organized as follows. First, we give a brief theoretical\nbackground. Second, we discuss how nuclear saturation can be viewed as\nan emergent property and present the current status of accurate\ncalculations of nuclear binding energies and radii from chiral\ninteractions. Third, we discuss how simple and new patterns of\nshell-structure emerge in neutron-rich oxygen and calcium isotopes\nfrom complex many-body computations in which effects of both coupling\nto the particle continuum and the inclusion of 3NFs are\nsignificant. Fourth, we discuss how to construct non-perturbative\nshell-model interactions from coupled-cluster theory starting from\nnucleon-nucleon and 3NFs. Using standard shell-model tools we can\ndescribe the emergence of rotational bands from first\nprinciples. Finally, we discuss future perspectives and some of the\nchallenges that we might expect when extending the nuclear\ncoupled-cluster program beyond its current reach.\n\n\\section{Theoretical background} \\label{sec:theory} The\ncoupled-cluster method was introduced in nuclear physics in the late\n1950s by Coester and\nK{\\\"u}mmel~\\cite{coester1958,coester1960}. Shortly thereafter it\nsparked in quantum chemistry when {\\v {C}}{\\'\\i}{\\v z}ek introduced it\nin the 1960's as a tool to study  correlated many-electron systems\n\\cite{cizek1966,cizek1969}. In quantum chemistry it then quickly\nbecame the method of choice for solving many-electron problems. In\nnuclear physics on the other hand, it saw only sporadic applications\nin the first few decades after its\ninception~\\cite{kuemmel1978,bishop1978,bishop1991}. During the last\ndecade or so, coupled-cluster theory has been revitalized in nuclear\nphysics~\\cite{mihaila2000b,dean2004,wloch2005,hagen2007b,hagen2010b,roth2011a}\nand has been used to compute nuclei from scratch based on modern\nforces from chiral EFT, see Ref.~\\cite{hagen2014} for a recent\nreview. Its role has also changed from being mostly post-dictive to\nexperiment to also having predictive capabilities. Examples are the\nprediction of the energy of the first excited $2^+$ state in the\nneutron-rich isotope $^{54}$Ca~\\cite{hagen2012b}, experimentally\nconfirmed by Steppenbeck {\\it et\nal.}~\\cite{steppenbeck2013,steppenbeck2013b}, and the predictions of\nthe dipole polarizability and the neutron distribution of\n$^{48}$Ca \\cite{hagen2015}.\n\nLet us briefly discuss some technical details of the coupled-cluster\nmethod and refer the reader to Ref.~\\cite{bartlett2007} for a\ncomprehensive review.  Coupled-cluster theory can be viewed as a\n(non-unitary) similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian such that\nthe Hartree-Fock reference becomes an exact eigenstate in a Hilbert\nspace limited to $n$-particle--$n$-hole ($n$p-$n$h) excitations of the\nreference state. The similarity transformation is generated by the\nexponentiation of particle-hole excitation operators up to the\n$n$p-$n$h level. The workhorse is the coupled-cluster singles doubles\n(CCSD) approximation corresponding to $n=2$, and triples $n=3$\nexcitations are included perturbatively.  The method has a polynomial\ncost in mass number and size of the single-particle basis, and\nHartree-Fock references corresponding to closed (sub-)shell nuclei are\ncomputationally least expensive.  The similarity-transformed\nHamiltonian is at the center of the coupled-cluster method. Its\ndiagonalization (via so-called ``equation-of-motion methods'') in a\nFock-space basis consisting of generalized particle-hole excitations\nyields excited states in the reference nucleus and states in\nneighboring nuclei that differ by one or two units in particle numbers\nor in the difference between neutron and proton numbers.\n\nWe perform coupled-cluster calculations based on the intrinsic\nHamiltonian, \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n  \\label{intham}\n  \\hat{H} = \\sum_{i<j}\\left({({\\bf p}_i-{\\bf p}_j)^2\\over 2mA} + \\hat{V}\n    _{NN}^{(i,j)}\\right) + \\sum_{ i<j<k}\\hat{V}_{\\rm 3N}^{(i,j,k)},\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\hat{H}=\\sum_{i&lt;j}\\left({({\\bf p}_{i}-{\\bf p}_{j})^{2}\\over 2mA}+\\hat{V}_{NN}^%&#10;{(i,j)}\\right)+\\sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}\\hat{V}_{\\rm 3N}^{(i,j,k)},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>H</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><mrow><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></munder><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>\ud835\udc29</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>\ud835\udc29</mi><mi>j</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>m</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>+</mo><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>+</mo><mrow><munder><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>j</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow></munder><msubsup><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">^</mo></mover><mrow><mn>3</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">N</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>k</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></msubsup></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.08203.tex", "nexttext": "\nthe normal-ordered two-body operator is given by \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 13198, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\hat{V}_{NN}$ is the nucleon-nucleon and $\\hat{V}_{\\rm 3N}$ is\nthe three-nucleon interaction.

This\napproximation is accurate in light and medium mass\nnuclei~\\cite{hagen2007a,roth2012,binder2013}.\n\nWe note that the coupled-cluster method preserves the translational\ninvariance of the Hamiltonian to a large degree of accuracy, because\nthe coupled-cluster wave function factors into an intrinsic wave\nfunction and a Gaussian center-of-mass wave\nfunction~\\cite{hagen2009a,hagen2010b,jansen2012}. This property is not\nlimited to the coupled-cluster method but is also demonstrated by\nother methods such as the in-medium similarity renormalization group\n(IMSRG) approach, see for example Refs.~\\cite{morris2015,hergert2015}.\n\n\\section{Nuclear saturation} \nAtomic nuclei along the valley of $\\beta$ stability are bound by about\n8~MeV per nucleon, and charge radii scale approximately as $R_c\\approx\n1.2 A^{1/3}$~fm, with $A$ denoting the mass number.  The accurate\ncomputation of nuclear binding energies and radii from microscopic\nHamiltonians has been a long-standing challenge in nuclear theory.\nFor the light ($p$-shell) nuclei this challenge was successfully\naddressed by quantum Monte Carlo computations~\\cite{carlson2015}. For\ninteractions based on chiral EFT, radii and binding energies are well\nreproduced for light nuclei, while oxygen isotopes and heavier nuclei\ntypically exhibit too much binding and too small radii, see\nRefs.~\\cite{binder2013b,lahde2014} for examples, and\nRef.~\\cite{ekstrom2015} for a compilation of results.\n\nWe note that nuclear saturation is a finely tuned property. Hebeler\n{\\it et al.}~\\cite{hebeler2011} considered families of\nsimilarity-renormalization group (SRG) transformed $NN$ interactions\n\\cite{bogner2007} from chiral EFT with ``bare'' 3NFs adjusted to the\nradii and binding energies of $^3$H and $^4$He. While the different\ninteractions agree on the binding energy of the $^4$He nucleus within\n1\\%, the corresponding Fermi momenta and binding energies at the\nsaturation point of nuclear matter vary by about 10\\% and 25\\%,\nrespectively. Likewise, Carlsson {\\it et al.}~\\cite{carlsson2015}\nfound that paramerizations of chiral EFT interactions that differ by\nabout 1\\% in the binding energy of $^4$He, differ by about 10\\% in the\nbinding energy of $^{16}$O. In nuclear lattice EFT calculations based\non chiral nucleon-nucleon and 3NFs, a repulsive phenomenological\nfour-body contact was added to the Hamiltonian to compensate for\nthe overbinding observed in nuclei heavier than $^{16}$O\n\\cite{lahde2014}. \n \nWe recall that the family of interactions from Ref.~\\cite{hebeler2011}\ndiffer in their high-momentum cutoff. This suggests that the\nsaturation point in nuclear matter is sensitive to details of the\nchiral interaction.  Consistent with this, coupled-cluster\ncalculations of nuclear matter with interactions from chiral EFT\nshowed that the saturation point is very sensitive to whether the\nemployed high-momentum regulator functions are local or\nnon-local~\\cite{hagen2013b}. On the one hand, these findings seem to\nbe unexpected from the view of an EFT. After all, differences in\nhigh-momentum aspects are supposed to be higher-order effects in the\nchiral power counting. On the other hand, we remind the reader that\nthe power counting is in the potential energy, and not in the total\nbinding energy. Thus, it might be that variation in the binding energy\nis consistent with (3NF) interactions at N$^2$LO. Finally, we note\nthat neutron matter is less sensitive to details of the high-momentum\nregulators~\\cite{hebeler2013,hebeler2015}, presumably because only the\ntwo-pion exchange 3NF enters (for non-local regulators). For\ninteractions from chiral EFT, the saturation mechanism consists of\nrelatively soft $NN$ forces that -- taken alone -- yield too much\nbinding and too small radii. The 3NFs act repulsively in matter and\nheavier nuclei, playing  thereby an important role in  nuclear \nsaturation~\\cite{bogner2005,hebeler2011,ekstrom2015}.\n\nReference~\\cite{hagen2013b} also demonstrated that no adjustment of\nthe short-range parts of the leading 3NFs is able to simultaneously\nreproduce the binding energy of $^3$H and the saturation point of\nnuclear matter (within a 5\\% uncertainty). A similar result has been\nfound for the Argonne V18 (AV18) $NN$ interaction~\\cite{wiringa1995}\nand a family of 3NF models~\\cite{logoteta2015}. In\nRefs.~\\cite{maris2013,carlson2015} it was also noted that AV18 with\nthe Illinois 3NFs produce accurate results for binding energies and\nspectra of $p$-shell nuclei while less so for neutron matter. On the\nother hand, AV18 with the Urbana 3NFs produce good results for neutron\nmatter while less accurate results for light $p$-shell nuclei.\n\nIn Ref.~\\cite{ekstrom2015} this challenge was addressed by including\ndata from ground-state energies and charge radii of $^2$H, $^3$H,\n$^3$He, $^4$He, $^{14}$C, $^{16}$O and ground-state energies of\n$^{22,24,25}$O into the optimization of the nuclear interaction\nNNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ from chiral EFT at\nNNLO.

This approach is consistent with the inclusion of light\nnuclei into the optimization and with an adjustment of low-energy constants (LECs)\norder-by-order in the power counting.  We refer the reader to\nRef.~\\cite{carlsson2015} for a detailed comparison and discussion of\nsequentially and simultaneously optimized chiral interactions.\n\nThe inclusion of light nuclei beyond the three-nucleon bound states in\nthe optimization of the nuclear interactions breaks with  the\ntraditional approach. There are additional arguments in support of this\nprocedure. We note that the isospin $T=3/2$ component of the 3NF is\nnot constrained by bound states in three- or four-nucleon systems. We\nalso note that the most accurate computations of light nuclei up to\nmass number $A\\le 12$~\\cite{carlson2015} employ 3NFs that have been\nadjusted to 20 states in nuclei with mass numbers $A\\le 10$\n\\cite{pieper2001b,carlson2015}.\n\nThough they result from a non-perturbative solution of a quantum\nmany-body problem, ground-state energies and charge radii of finite\nnuclei are truly low-energy observables -- and their inclusion in the\noptimization of LECs is thus consistent with EFT\nideas. Reference~\\cite{binder2015} shows that the binding energies of\n$^3$H, $^4$He, and $^6$Li exhibit the same convergence pattern with\nincreasing order of the chiral power counting as scattering\nobservables at low energies of 10~MeV.\n\nFigure~\\ref{NNLOsat2} shows the results for ground-state energies per\nparticle and differences between theoretical and experimental charge\nradii of selected light and medium-mass nuclei computed with\nNNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ and compares them to other {\\it ab initio}\ncomputations. Here the results up to $^{40}$Ca are from\nRef.~\\cite{ekstrom2015}, the results for $^{48}$Ca from\nRef.~\\cite{hagen2015}, while the results for $^{56}$Ni are new. For\nthe last two nuclei, the ground-state energy is computed using the\nCCSD with perturbative $\\Lambda$-triples ($\\Lambda$-CCSD(T))\n\\cite{taube2008}, while for the lighter nuclei we also added a\nperturbative estimate for the residual 3NF term in Eq.~(\\ref{no3})\n(yielding about 1\\% in additional binding energy). The computed\nbinding energy per particle for $^{56}$Ni is 8.26~MeV slightly less\nbound than the experimental value of 8.64~MeV. The charge radius of\n$^{56}$Ni is not measured. Therefore we compare the computed charge\nradius of 3.72~fm to the known charge radius of 3.77~fm for $^{58}$Ni\n(which is probably larger than what is expected for $^{56}$Ni.). The\ncoupled-cluster calculations of $^{56}$Ni were performed in the same\nmodel space as Ref.~\\cite{hagen2015}.

To\ndescribe reactions in nuclei one needs to account for decay channels\nin which coupling to both bound- and scattering states are\nimportant. The coupling to the continuum impacts also the level\nordering of unbound states and shell-structure in nuclei.\nUnderstanding how shell structure evolve in neutron-rich nuclei is of\ngreat experimental and theoretical interest, in particular since shell\nstructures impact the limits of stability known as the dripline (that\nis the limit where adding another neutron or proton to a bound isotope\ndoes not produce a particle stable ground-state), and thereby the\nnumber of nuclei that can exist. As the neutron-to-proton ratio varies\nit has been found in several isotopes that the magic numbers\n$2,8,20,28,50,\\ldots$ of the shell-model of Goeppert-Mayer and Jensen\ncan be less magic than expected, while the appearance of new magic\nnumbers in other isotopes have been observed.  Understanding the\nmechanisms behind the evolution of shell-structure in atomic nuclei is\nof considerable theoretical interest. In this section we discuss\nand present new results for unbound states in the neutron-rich oxygen\nand calcium isotopes, with an emphasis on the role of coupling to the\nparticle continuum and state-of-the-art chiral nucleon-nucleon and\nthree-nucleon interactions.\n\n\\subsection{Coupled-cluster calculations based on a Gamow-Hartree-Fock\n  basis}\nAs discussed in the previous section, coupled-cluster calculations\nbased on chiral nucleon-nucleon and 3NFs can now accurately describe\nbulk properties such as binding energies and radii of light- and\nmedium-mass nuclei. To provide experiment with reliable predictions\nfor exotic nuclei, it is also necessary that the coupling to the\nscattering continuum is properly taken into account. Here we briefly\noutline and discuss how the coupling to the particle-continuum can be\ntaken into account in \\emph{ab initio} coupled-cluster calculations of\nnuclei based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and 3NFs.\n\nSimilar to what is done in the Gamow-shell-model\n\\cite{michel2002,idbetan2002,hagen2006b}, we use a Berggren basis\n\\cite{berggren1968,berggren1971,lind1993} as a starting point for our\ncontinuum coupled-cluster calculations\n\\cite{hagen2007d,hagen2010a}.

This property is not\nlimited to the coupled-cluster method but is also demonstrated by\nother methods such as the in-medium similarity renormalization group\n(IMSRG) approach, see for example Refs.~\\cite{morris2015,hergert2015}.\n\n\\section{Nuclear saturation} \nAtomic nuclei along the valley of $\\beta$ stability are bound by about\n8~MeV per nucleon, and charge radii scale approximately as $R_c\\approx\n1.2 A^{1/3}$~fm, with $A$ denoting the mass number.  The accurate\ncomputation of nuclear binding energies and radii from microscopic\nHamiltonians has been a long-standing challenge in nuclear theory.\nFor the light ($p$-shell) nuclei this challenge was successfully\naddressed by quantum Monte Carlo computations~\\cite{carlson2015}. For\ninteractions based on chiral EFT, radii and binding energies are well\nreproduced for light nuclei, while oxygen isotopes and heavier nuclei\ntypically exhibit too much binding and too small radii, see\nRefs.~\\cite{binder2013b,lahde2014} for examples, and\nRef.~\\cite{ekstrom2015} for a compilation of results.\n\nWe note that nuclear saturation is a finely tuned property. Hebeler\n{\\it et al.}~\\cite{hebeler2011} considered families of\nsimilarity-renormalization group (SRG) transformed $NN$ interactions\n\\cite{bogner2007} from chiral EFT with ``bare'' 3NFs adjusted to the\nradii and binding energies of $^3$H and $^4$He. While the different\ninteractions agree on the binding energy of the $^4$He nucleus within\n1\\%, the corresponding Fermi momenta and binding energies at the\nsaturation point of nuclear matter vary by about 10\\% and 25\\%,\nrespectively. Likewise, Carlsson {\\it et al.}~\\cite{carlsson2015}\nfound that paramerizations of chiral EFT interactions that differ by\nabout 1\\% in the binding energy of $^4$He, differ by about 10\\% in the\nbinding energy of $^{16}$O. In nuclear lattice EFT calculations based\non chiral nucleon-nucleon and 3NFs, a repulsive phenomenological\nfour-body contact was added to the Hamiltonian to compensate for\nthe overbinding observed in nuclei heavier than $^{16}$O\n\\cite{lahde2014}. \n \nWe recall that the family of interactions from Ref.~\\cite{hebeler2011}\ndiffer in their high-momentum cutoff. This suggests that the\nsaturation point in nuclear matter is sensitive to details of the\nchiral interaction.  Consistent with this, coupled-cluster\ncalculations of nuclear matter with interactions from chiral EFT\nshowed that the saturation point is very sensitive to whether the\nemployed high-momentum regulator functions are local or\nnon-local~\\cite{hagen2013b}. On the one hand, these findings seem to\nbe unexpected from the view of an EFT. After all, differences in\nhigh-momentum aspects are supposed to be higher-order effects in the\nchiral power counting. On the other hand, we remind the reader that\nthe power counting is in the potential energy, and not in the total\nbinding energy. Thus, it might be that variation in the binding energy\nis consistent with (3NF) interactions at N$^2$LO. Finally, we note\nthat neutron matter is less sensitive to details of the high-momentum\nregulators~\\cite{hebeler2013,hebeler2015}, presumably because only the\ntwo-pion exchange 3NF enters (for non-local regulators). For\ninteractions from chiral EFT, the saturation mechanism consists of\nrelatively soft $NN$ forces that -- taken alone -- yield too much\nbinding and too small radii. The 3NFs act repulsively in matter and\nheavier nuclei, playing  thereby an important role in  nuclear \nsaturation~\\cite{bogner2005,hebeler2011,ekstrom2015}.\n\nReference~\\cite{hagen2013b} also demonstrated that no adjustment of\nthe short-range parts of the leading 3NFs is able to simultaneously\nreproduce the binding energy of $^3$H and the saturation point of\nnuclear matter (within a 5\\% uncertainty). A similar result has been\nfound for the Argonne V18 (AV18) $NN$ interaction~\\cite{wiringa1995}\nand a family of 3NF models~\\cite{logoteta2015}. In\nRefs.~\\cite{maris2013,carlson2015} it was also noted that AV18 with\nthe Illinois 3NFs produce accurate results for binding energies and\nspectra of $p$-shell nuclei while less so for neutron matter. On the\nother hand, AV18 with the Urbana 3NFs produce good results for neutron\nmatter while less accurate results for light $p$-shell nuclei.\n\nIn Ref.~\\cite{ekstrom2015} this challenge was addressed by including\ndata from ground-state energies and charge radii of $^2$H, $^3$H,\n$^3$He, $^4$He, $^{14}$C, $^{16}$O and ground-state energies of\n$^{22,24,25}$O into the optimization of the nuclear interaction\nNNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ from chiral EFT at\nNNLO.

Here new (sub-) shell\nclosures at $N=14$ and $N=16$ have been observed experimentally\n\\cite{stanoiu2004,kanungo2009,hoffman2009}, while the $N=20$ magic\nnumber is weakened and disappears along the isotone chain starting\nfrom $^{40}$Ca towards the island of inversion nuclei $^{32}$Mg and\n$^{30}$Ne, where the onset of large deformations is observed\n\\cite{motobayashi1995}. Furthermore, $^{24}$O is the last bound\nisotope with the ground-state of $^{25}$O being particle unstable at\nthe neutron decay energy $770$~keV and with a width of $172(30)$keV\n\\cite{hoffman2008}. This has become known as the oxygen anomaly, since\nby adding just one more proton pushes the neutron dripline\nconsiderably further out with $^{31}$F being the last known bound\nfluorine isotope \\cite{sakurai1999}. This oxygen anomaly was given a\ntheoretical explanation in Ref.~\\cite{otsuka2010}, where it was shown\nin shell-model calculations that 3NFs act repulsively and correctly\nset the dripline at $^{24}$O. Perhaps even more interesting than\n$^{25}$O is its neighbor $^{26}$O. This nucleus has recently been\nobserved at a decay energy of $150^{+50}_{-150}$keV and with a width\nof $5$keV. It decays by two-neutron emission\n\\cite{lunderberg2012}. Few-body models of $^{26}$O have empasized the\nrole of di-neutron correlations in the two-neutron direct decay of\nthis nucleus, and based on the experimentally determined width of\n$5$keV set an upper bound of $1$keV for the decay energy\n\\cite{grigorenko2013}, in other words right at the two-neutron\nemission threshold. More precise data for this nucleus will challenge and \nimpact on our theoretical understanding of two-neutron decays in\nneutron-rich nuclei. \n\nThe neutron-rich nucleus $^{28}$O is even more exotic. In the standard\nshell-model picture this nucleus is a doubly magic nucleus with $N=20$\nand $Z=8$ shell closures. \\emph{Ab initio} calculations of this\nnucleus based on nucleon-nucleon interactions and 3NFs all predict\nthat $^{28}$O is particle unstable with respect to $^{24}$O\n\\cite{otsuka2010,hergert2013,cipollone2013}. However, none of these\ncalculations take into account the coupling to the particle continuum\nwhich impacts loosely bound and unbound states.\n\nIn Ref.~\\cite{hagen2012a} the role of coupling to the\nparticle-continuum was investigated on low-lying excited states in\nneutron-rich oxygen isotopes. The effects of 3NFs were included in\nterms of a schematic density dependent correction to the chiral\nnucleon-nucleon interaction N$^3$LO \\cite{entem2003} by\nnormal-ordering the 3NF in symmetric nuclear matter. It was found that\nthe coupling to the particle continuum had a modest effect of at most\na few hundred keV's on states that are dominated by $sd$-shell\nconfigurations. The effect of the particle continuum on\nnegative-parity states and possible intruder states from the\n$pf$-shell will be addressed below.\n\nPhenomenological shell-model approaches that properly take into\naccount the coupling to the particle continuum also exist. The\nGamow-shell-model \\cite{michel2002,idbetan2002} has been successfully\napplied to unbound states in selected isotopes of helium and oxygen.\nIn Ref.~\\cite{volya2005} the particle continuum was included in a\nunified shell-model approach based on the phenomenological USD\ninteraction \\cite{brown1988} with accurate predictions for\n$^{25,26}$O, while $^{28}$O was predicted to be unbound with a decay\nenergy of $1.44$MeV.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{figs/Ox_chain_BE.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online) Ground-state energies of the oxygen isotopes\n  $^{16,22,24,28}$O computed from $\\Lambda$-CCSD(T) using two\n  NNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ (blue solid circlies) and N$^3$LO + L(400) (red\n  solid diamonds), and compared to experiment (black dashed-dotted\n  line).

Experimental data are included in the\nfigure. First we consider the recently optimized NNLO$_{\\rm sat}$\n\\cite{ekstrom2015}, and then the chiral nucleon-nucleon interaction at\nN$^3$LO~\\cite{entem2003} with the 3NF at N$^2$LO using a local\nregulator with cutoff $\\Lambda_{\\rm 3N} = 400$ MeV (which we denote as\nN$^3$LO + L(400)) \\cite{navratil2007,roth2012}. We note that for\nNNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ the binding energies of $^{16,22,24}$O were included\nin the fit, while for N$^3$LO + L(400) only data up to $^4$He were\nincluded in the fit of the low-energy constants. The Hamiltonian\nN$^3$LO + L(400) has been shown to produce accurate results for both\nbinding energies and spectra in and around the oxygen isotope chain\n\\cite{hergert2013,cipollone2013,bogner2014,jansen2014}. The\nmodel-space used is a Gamow-Hartree-Fock basis built from a mixed\nrepresentation of $N_{\\rm max} = 2n+l = 14$ harmonic-oscillator basis\nfunctions and a Berggren basis for the $d_{3/2}$ neutron partial\nwave. The oscillator frequencies were set to $\\hbar\\Omega = 22$~MeV\nfor NNLO$_{\\rm sat}$, and $\\hbar\\Omega = 20$~MeV for N$^3$LO + L(400),\nrespectively. For the 3NFs we used the additional energy cuts\n$E_{3\\rm{max}}=N_1+N_2+N_3 \\leq 16$ for NNLO$_{\\rm sat}$, and\n$E_{3\\rm{max}}=N_1+N_2+N_3 \\leq 14$ for N$^3$LO + L(400),\nrespectively. For both Hamiltonians $^{28}$O is predicted to be\nunbound with respect to $^{24}$O by 2.5 for NNLO$_{\\rm sat}$ and\n2.9~MeV for N$^3$LO + L(400), respectively. We found that the\ninclusion of the continuum for the $d_{3/2}$ partial wave adds about\n1~MeV of additonal binding compared to using a harmonic oscillator\nbasis for this partial wave.\n\nThe exotic nucleus $^{28}$O is close to the known island of inversion\nregion, where intruder states from the $pf$-shell, deformation and\ncontinuum couplings play an important role for the structure of\nground- and low-lying excited states\n\\cite{zhang2014,xu2015}. Furthermore, relativistic mean-field\ncalculations of $^{31}$Ne found that the $pf$-orbitals are inverted\ndue to continuum coupling even in the case of a spherical or slightly\ndeformed $^{31}$Ne \\cite{zhang2014}. It is therefore reasonable to\nexpect that configuration mixing from the $pf$-shell and continuum\ncoupling will play a role on the structure of $^{28}$O as well. In\norder to cast some light on how important configuration mixing with\nthe $pf$-shell may be on the structure of neutron-rich oxygen isotopes\nwe study the evolution of the unbound $J^\\pi =\n{1/2}^-,{3/2}^-,{7/2}^-$ states and the unbound $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+$\nstate that are dominated by one-particle configurations in the odd\noxygen isotopes $^{17,23,25}$O. These states can be computed in the\nparticle-attached equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (PA-EOM-CC)\nmethod \\cite{gour2006}, and we include continuum effects by using a\nBerggren basis for the $d_{3/2},p_{1/2},p_{3/2},f_{7/2}$ partial\nwaves. The PA-EOM-CC method was previously used to compute resonances\nin $A=17$ nuclei using nucleon-nucleon forces only \\cite{hagen2010a},\nwhile here we for the first time we include also 3NFs and compute\nnegative-parity states.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{figs/Ox17_Ox25_resonances.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online) Energies (with respect to the\n  particle-emission threshold) of unbound $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+$,\n  ${1/2}^-$, ${3/2}^-$ and ${7/2}^-$ states in the odd oxgyen isotopes\n  $^{17,23,25}$O.

Here we only consider\nthe chiral interaction N$^3$LO + L(400), which is known to reproduce\nspectra in the $sd$-shell. It is seen that the effect of the\ncontinuum coupling on the $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+$ and $J^\\pi\n= {7/2}^-$ resonant states is rather small, which is due to the large centrifugal\nbarrier ($l=2,3$) for these states and that these states are dominated\nby one-particle radial wavefunctions of zero nodes, limiting thereby\ntheir radial extension and making them quasi-bound within the\ncentrifugal barrier. On the other hand, the continuum coupling plays a\nsignificant role on the $J^\\pi =\n{1/2}^-,{3/2}^-$ states.  These states are dominated by one-particle states\nwith a smaller centrifugal barrier ($l=1$) and radial wave functions\nwith one node that increases their radial extension. This results in a\nlarger sensitivity to the continuum, similar to what is found for\nloosely-bound halo-states. In particular, we observe that the continuum is\nresponsible for inverting the order between the $J^\\pi =\n{3/2}^-,{7/2}^-$ states in $^{17}$O, while in $^{25}$O the $J^\\pi =\n{1/2}^-,{3/2}^-$ states are lowered by about 2~MeV and appear as very\nbroad resonances. These findings contrast the results obtained using\nthe harmonic-oscillator basis where no widths can appear. Such a large\nwidth and a near degeneracy of the decay energies of the$J^\\pi\n= {1/2}^-,{3/2}^-$  states in $^{25}$O would present a significant challenge\nfor experiments targeting these states. We note that there are many\nnegative parity states in $^{17}$O, and for comparison to experiment\none would also need to know transition strengths. In $^{23,25}$O the\nsituation is simpler, and our results for the $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+$\nunbound states are in good agreement with the experimental data of\n1.27~MeV \\cite{elekes2007} and 0.77~MeV \\cite{hoffman2008},\nrespectively. In these nuclei no data is available for negative parity\nstates.\n\nAnother interesting feature is that with increasing\nneutron-to-proton ratio a gap between the $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+$ state and\nthe $J^\\pi = {1/2}^-,{3/2}^-$ states seems to be developing. One can\ntherefore speculate whether there is an \n\n$N=20$ (sub-) shell-closure in\n$^{28}$O. However, this must be investigated in more detail by\naddressing systematic uncertainties of the Hamiltonian and the\ncoupled-cluster method, as well as computing other observables such as\nseparation energies, pairing gaps, and the $2^+$ excited state, all being  \nindicators of shell-closures.\n\n\\subsection{Unbound states in neutron-rich calcium isotopes} Recent\ninterest in understanding how shell structures evolve in calcium\nisotopes has revealed several interesting and new features, such as\nthe newly suggested magic nuclei $^{52}$Ca and $^{54}$Ca with $N=32$\nshell-closure \\cite{wienholtz2013}, and $N=34$ (sub-) shell-closure\n\\cite{steppenbeck2013,steppenbeck2013b}. While 3NFs have been shown to\nbe important to explain these new (sub-) shell-closures\n\\cite{holt2012,hagen2012b}, coupled-cluster calculations of the odd\nand neutron-rich isotopes $^{53,55,61}$Ca ~\\cite{hagen2012b} based on\nchiral nucleon-nucleon and schematic density-dependent 3NFs,\ndemonstrated that the role of the coupling to the particle continuum\nsignificantly impacts and rearranges the order of states close to the\nparticle-emission thresholds. In particular, for the exotic nucleus\n$^{61}$Ca the ground-state was computed to be a $J^\\pi={1/2}^+$ state\ndominated by configurations in the $s$ partial-wave, and with a\ncompressed and inverted order for the $J^\\pi = {5/2}^+, {9/2}^+$\nexcited states in contrast to what one could expect from the standard\nshell-model. In Ref.~\\cite{hagen2013} coupled-cluster computations of\nelastic neutron scattering on $^{60}$Ca were performed, and the\nextracted scattering length for the $s$-wave phase-shifts was found to\nbe tens of fermi. The very large scattering length was used as input\nto halo EFT \\cite{bertulani2002,bedaque2003} in order to explore the\npossible onset of Efimov physics in $^{62}$Ca.\n\nThe ``bunching'' of the $gds$ shell-model states in neutron-rich\ncalcium isotopes has also been observed in nuclear density-functional\nand relativistic mean-field calculations, suggesting an onset of\ndeformation around $^{60}$Ca and with the dripline possibly extending\nall the way out to $^{70}$Ca\n\\cite{nazarewicz1996,fayans2000,meng2002,erler2012}. In addition to\neffects of the coupling to the continuum, deformation has also been\nshown to impact and lead to a near degeneracy of shell-model states in\nneutron-rich nuclei \\cite{dobaczewski1994,hamamoto2012}. Shell-model\ncalculations based on phenomenological interactions also predicts a\nbunching and inversion of the $d_{5/2}, g_{9/2}$ shell-model orbitals\nin $^{61}$Ca \\cite{lenzi2010}. Future experimental efforts at rare\nisotope facilities promise to probe shell structure beyond\n$^{54}$Ca. The heaviest calcium isotope to have been produced so far\nis $^{58}$Ca \\cite{tarasov2009} and data on $^{62}$Ti is currently\nbeing analyzed at RIKEN. Confronting theory with data for the exotic\nnucleus $^{60}$Ca and beyond might therefore not be too far in the\nfuture.\n\nIn the remainder of this section we focus on the evolution of the\n$J^\\pi = {3/2}^+,{5/2}^+,{9/2}^+$ states in the odd calcium isotopes\n$^{53,55,61}$Ca. In these exotic isotopes there are no  data for\nthese states. We again use the PA-EOM-CC method to compute states that\nare dominated by one-particle excitations. Here we use the chiral\nnucleon-nucleon interaction at N$^3$LO \\cite{entem2003}, SRG evolved\nto the cutoff $\\lambda =1.8~\\mathrm{fm}^{-1}$. The low-energy\nconstants of the leading-order chiral 3NF were adjusted to the binding\nenergies and radii of $^3$H and $^4$He, and within systematic\nuncertainties reproduce the saturation point in nuclear matter\n\\cite{hebeler2011}. This chiral interaction was recently applied to\nthe computation of the binding energy, dipole polarizability, and the\nneutron/proton root-mean-square point radii of $^{48}$Ca\n\\cite{hagen2015}. For this interaction, $^{48}$Ca was found to be\nslightly overbound by about 4~MeV while the charge radius was\nunderestimated by about 0.2~fm. To construct a Gamow-Hartree-Fock\nbasis, we use the same model space as in Ref.~\\cite{hagen2015}\n(i.e. $N_{\\rm max} = 14, E_{3\\rm{max}}=16$ and $\\hbar\\Omega =\n22$~MeV), and a Berggren basis for the $d_{3/2}, d_{5/2}, g_{9/2}$\npartial waves.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{figs/Ca55_Ca60_resonances.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online) Energies (with respect to the\n  particle-emission threshold) of unbound $J^\\pi = {3/2}^+$,\n  ${5/2}^+$ and ${9/2}^+$ states in the odd calcium isotopes\n  $^{53,55,61}$Ca. For each nucleus the left group of states are\n  computed using a harmonic-oscillator Hartree-Fock basis, while the\n  corresponding right group states using a Gamow-Hartree-Fock\n  basis.

We observe a striking feature, the coupling\nto the continuum inverts the order of the $J^\\pi =\n{3/2}^+,{5/2}^+,{9/2}^+$ states, with the $J^\\pi ={3/2}^+$ state being\na very broad resonance and with a decay energy located slightly above\nthe decay energy of the $J^\\pi ={5/2}^+$ resonant state, which has a\nconsiderable smaller width. Furthermore, in $^{61}$Ca we observe a\nnear degeneracy for the decay energies of the $J^\\pi\n={3/2}^+,{5/2}^+,{9/2}^+$ states. We recall that in \\cite{hagen2013}\nthe ground-state of $^{61}$Ca was found to be a barely bound $J^\\pi =\n{1/2}^+$ state, dominated by $s$-waves. That the $J^\\pi\n={3/2}^+,{5/2}^+,{9/2}^+$ states are found to be close to the\nthreshold in $^{61}$Ca indicates that deformation and pairing will\nplay a significant role in the neutron rich calcium isotopes beyond\n$^{61}$Ca. A proper theoretical description of isotopes beyond\n$^{61}$Ca should therefore account for all these effects, that is,\ncontinuum coupling, deformation and pairing, and many-body\ncorrelations.\n\nIn the naive shell-model picture one could expect that the $J^\\pi\n={9/2}^+$ state, which is dominated by $g_{9/2}$ single-particle\nconfigurations, should be lower in energy than the $J^\\pi ={3/2}^+,\n{5/2}^+$ states, which are dominated by $d_{3/2}, d_{5/2}$\nsingle-particle configurations. As Fig.~\\ref{Ca55_Ca61_res} shows,\nthis naive shell-model order is in fact realized if one neglects the\ncoupling to the particle-continuum and uses a harmonic-oscillator\nbasis only. This result is consistent with what was found in\nRefs.~\\cite{hagen2012b,hagen2013}, where a schematic 3NF was used. We\ncan understand the impact of the continuum on these unbound states by\nemploying a simple mean-field picture. In this picture the $J^\\pi\n={9/2}^+$ state is a pure $g_{9/2}$ single-particle state with a large\ncentrifugal barrier ($l=4$). Furthermore, its wave-function has no\nradial nodes, localizing thereby the state within the barrier and making it\nquasi-bound. Indeed, as one would expect, Fig.~\\ref{Ca55_Ca61_res}\nshows that the continuum has only a small impact on this state,\nlowering it by a few hundred keVs compared to the harmonic-oscillator\nbasis, and with a width less than 10~keV. On the other hand, the\ncontinuum has a significant impact on the unbound $J^\\pi\n={3/2}^+, {5/2}^+$ states. In the mean-field picture these states are pure\n$d_{3/2}$ and $d_{5/2}$ single-particle states with a smaller\ncentrifugal barrier ($l=2$) and with wave-functions with one radial\nnode that pushes these states outside the barrier. The impact of the\ncontinuum on these states is therefore significant, and similar to\nwhat was found for the $J^\\pi = {1/2}^-,{3/2}^-$ states in the oxygen\nisotopes $^{17,23,25}$O.\n\nOne may speculate that the trend found for unbound states in\nneutron-rich isotopes of oxygen and calcium may also be found in\nneutron-rich nickel isotopes. Here one may expect a level inversion of\nthe unbound $J^\\pi = {11/2}^-, {7/2}^-, {3/2}^-$ negative parity\nstates associated with the $0h_{11/2}, 1f_{7/2}, 2p_{3/2}$ mean-field\norbitals. Future experiments targeting spectroscopy in the exotic\nnuclei $^{61}$Ca and $^{79}$Ni is therefore needed in order to fully\nunderstand how shell-structure evolve at large neutron-to-proton\nratios and above particle decay thresholds.\n\n\\section{Emergence of nuclear deformation} \nNuclear deformation is due to the emergent breaking of rotational\nsymmetry, that is the precursors of spontaneous breaking of rotational\nsymmetry in a finite\nsystem~\\cite{bohr1975nobel,yannouleas2007,papenbrock2014}. The key\nsignatures are rotational bands with energies $E\\approx B I(I+1)$ for\nstates with angular momenta $I=0,2,4\\ldots$, and strong collective\n$B(E2)$ transitions between these states. Here, the rotational\nconstant $B$ is typically much smaller than the energy scales\nassociated with single-particle degrees of freedom~\\cite{bohr1975}.\nThe collective nature and the low energy of the emergent rotational\nconstant $B$ make {\\it ab initio} computations of such states\nchallenging. For the nucleus like $^{12}$C, the energies of Yrast\nstates were reproduced in the {\\it ab initio}\ncomputations detailed in Refs.~\\cite{navratil2000,epelbaum2012,forssen2013,maris2014},\nwith accurate quadrupole moments in Ref.~\\cite{epelbaum2012}.\nCollective properties of other $p$-shell nuclei from {\\it ab initio}\nmethods are addressed in\nRefs.~\\cite{dytrych2013,caprio2013,caprio2015}. Very recently, {\\it ab\n  initio} computations of Yrast states in $sd$-shell nuclei have\nbecome possible~\\cite{jansen2015,stroberg2015,hergert2015}. These\nworks are based on the recently developed effective shell-model\ninteractions from {\\it ab initio} methods like coupled-cluster theory\nand IMSRG \\cite{bogner2014,jansen2014}.\n\n\nThe idea behind the coupled-cluster effective-interaction (CCEI)\nmethod is to compute a non-perturbative shell-model interaction using\nthe coupled-cluster method and starting from state-of-the-art chiral\nnucleon-nucleon interactions and 3NFs. In this approach, the\ncoupled-cluster method is used to compute spectra in nuclei with one,\nand two nucleons outside a closed\ncore~\\cite{gour2006,jansen2011,jansen2012,shen2014}. To be specific,\nthe computation of neutron-rich isotopes of carbon and oxygen can be\nbased on an effective neutron-interaction in the neutron $sd$-shell\nmodel space.  Following Refs.~\\cite{lisetskiy2008,dikmen2015}, {\\it ab\n  initio} computations of $^{14,15,16}$C and $^{16,17,18}$O are input\nto the Okubo-Lee-Suzuki projection\ntechnique~\\cite{okubo1954,suzuki1980,suzuki1994,suzuki2000,kvaal2008},\nyielding an effective interaction in the neutron $sd$ model space. The\nsymmetric orthogonalization~\\cite{scholtz1992,navratil1996} yields an\neffective interaction that is Hermitian. For each mass number one\nobtains a new interaction because the intrinsic kinetic energy of the\nunderlying chiral Hamiltonian uses the mass number $A$ of the target\nnucleus. Without any further tuning of parameters, the CCEI method\nyields effective neutron-neutron interactions for oxygen and carbon isotopes with $^{16}$O and $^{14}$C as \ncores~\\cite{jansen2014}, respectively. \nThe resulting spectra are in good agreement\nwith experiment and comparable to the agreements obtained with\nphenomenological Hamiltonians such as the USD \\cite{brown1988} and the\nWBP \\cite{warburton1992} effective shell-model Hamiltonians.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=1.0\\textwidth]{figs/Ne20Mg24Yrast.pdf}\n\\caption{(Color online) Yrast states in ${}^{20}$Ne and ${}^{24}$Mg\nusing CCEI and USDB compared to experimental values}\n  \\label{fig:ne20mg24yrast}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nRecently, the CCEI has been extended to the full effective interaction\nbetween neutrons and protons in the $sd$-shell valence space, taking\n$^{16}$O as a core and performing {\\it ab initio} coupled-cluster\ncalculations of $^{16,17,18}$O, $^{17,18}$F, and $^{18}$Ne.  These\ncalculations are based on the same chiral interaction used in\nRef.~\\cite{jansen2014}, and the resulting effective shell-model\ninteraction was again truncated to one-body and two-body terms. In\ncontrast to Ref.~\\cite{jansen2014}, this effective shell-model\ninteraction was constructed from a chiral interaction that uses the\nmass number $A$ of the $^{16,17,18}$O, $^{17,18}$F, and $^{18}$Ne\nnuclei. One obtains thereby an effective interaction for all\n$sd$-shell nuclei that is independent of the nucleon number\n$A$. Diagonalization of the resulting $sd$ shell Hamiltonian matrices\nallowed the authors of Ref.~\\cite{jansen2015} to compute rotational\nbands of neon and magnesium isotopes.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:ne20mg24yrast} shows the ground-state rotational bands\nin ${}^{20}$Ne and ${}^{24}$Mg and compares them to experimental data\nand to results from the USDB interaction \\cite{brown2006}. The\nagreement of these yrast states to phenomenological interactions and\ndata is good.\n \nThe computation of rotational bands (and the accurate reproduction of\nmoments of inertia) are encouraging first results for {\\it ab initio}\napproaches to nuclear deformation. Our next steps will include the\ncomputation of static and transition electric quadrupole moments as\nwell. The latter requires the development of effective (quadrupole)\noperators that are calculated within the same theoretical framework.\nSteps in these directions are under way and we expect that such\napproaches will result in new insights into the theory of effective\ncharges.\n\n\\section{Summary and outlook: simplicity from complexity}\nThe physics of nuclei, with intricate forces yet to be completely\ndetermined, two different fermionic species, many energy scales and\nthe absence of an external potential, generates a range and diversity\nof behaviors that pose great challenges to a microscopic and\npredictive description. Computing and understanding the wide range of\nnuclear phenomena that emerge at different levels of complexity and\nenergy scales from the underlying forces and laws of motion is still\nan open and unsettled issue. In the past decade, significant strides\nhave been made toward this goal. The description of heavier nuclei\nusing {\\em ab initio} approaches has now become possible due to recent\ndevelopment and advances in nuclear interactions,\nrenormalization-group techniques, many-body methods and an increasing\ncomputing power that continues to scale according to Moore's law.\n\n\nSeveral many-body methods are now available that exhibit a polynomial\nscaling with mass number and are improvable in a systematic\nway~\\cite{dickhoff2004,hagen2010b,tsukiyama2011,soma2013,binder2013b,hergert2013b}.\nThis soft scaling combined with the exponential growth in computing\npower allows us now to address heavier nuclei from first principles\nfor the first time. Modern nuclear forces, based on EFT concepts and\nideas from renormalization\ngroup~\\cite{epelbaum2009,bogner2010,machleidt2011}, and optimized to\nreproduce data on selected light nuclei yielded accurate results and\neven reliable predictions for a wide variety of\nnuclei~\\cite{otsuka2010,epelbaum2011,hagen2012b,wienholtz2013,hergert2013}. An\nEFT interaction that was constrained to radii and binding energies of\nisotopes up to oxygen~\\cite{ekstrom2015} accurately\nreproduced the charge densities in $^{40,48}$Ca and yielded a prediction\nof the neutron distribution of $^{48}$Ca \\cite{hagen2015}.  The\nmethodological advances in constructing single-particle and\nmany-particle basis functions for continuum properties, allow us to\nstudy nuclei close to the limits of stability.  Furthermore, as we\nillustrated here, we are now in a position where we can compute\neffective Hamiltonians (including single-particle energies and\ntwo-body interactions) for a single major shells. These effective\ninteractions are without empirical adjustments and led to the\ncomputation of spectra of $sd$-shell nuclei. The onset of deformations\nin neon and magnesium isotopes were studied recently\n\\cite{jansen2015,stroberg2015} and reviewed in the previous\nsection. These results demonstrate the potential and capabilities of\npresent many-body methods.\n\nSimple patterns in nuclei such as nuclear saturation, rotational and\nvibrational spectra, Borromean properties and halo-like density\ndistributions properties, and shell-structure are now being approached \nfrom microscopic many-body calculations. We are reaching a point\nwhere few-body and mean-field models specifically aimed at describing\nsuch emergent phenomena can be complemented by more microscopic and\nrefined models. This is not to say that these simpler models will be\nreplaced by ever more complex and complicated quantum-mechanical\nmany-body descriptions. They will continue to play an important role\nin the discovery process of new phenomena, and in their interpretation\nand understanding in terms of more intuitive pictures and ideas.\n\nThe microscopic description of nuclei from first principles highlights\nvarious aspects of the nuclear many-body problem, ranging from the\noptimization of low-energy coupling constants of the nuclear\ninteractions, the role of 3NFs, the role of high-momentum modes and\nmany-body correlations, and to the treatment of the atomic nucleus as\nan open-quantum system with a strong coupling to the particle\ncontinuum and decay channels. Depending on the energy scales that are\nrelevant for the description of the specific nuclear property and its\norigin, these components vary in their importance. For example,\nincluding the coupling to the particle continuum is not necessary for\nstrongly bound nuclei, but it plays a crucial role on evolution of\nshell-structure in neutron-rich oxygen and calcium isotopes.  Another\nexample is the important role of 3NFs on nuclear saturation and on\nshell closures, while its role on \\emph{ab initio} calculations of\nrotational bands in the deformed nuclei $^{20}$Ne and $^{24}$Mg seems\nless prominent. Simple models of the nucleus may therefore often guide\nus in deciphering the importance of these different components.\n\n \nWe end this paper by pointing out several open challenges and exciting\navenues.  The recent work \\cite{binder2015b} with interactions from\nEFT tailored to a harmonic oscillator basis, might hold some promise\nfor performing accurate {\\it ab initio} calculations for heavier\nnuclei and address issues related to nuclear shell-structure and\nsaturation over the entire nuclear chart. The technical capabilities\nare now in place~\\cite{binder2013b}, and the onus is on the\noptimization of accurate interactions. Further development of\nopen-shell methods such as CCEI and valence-space IM-SRG might open up\na path for {\\it ab initio} studies of neutrinoless double-beta decay\nin nuclei such as $^{76}$Ge and $^{136}$Xe. Along similar lines, a\nderivation of effective operators and interactions for heavier nuclei\nopens up possibilities for studies of  electroweak\ninteractions in a nuclear medium.\n\nThese studies and the pertinent formalism can also be extended to\ninfinite matter, of great interest for studies of dense objects like\nneutron stars. Reliable many-body derivations of the equation-of-state\nand effective interactions and operators for dense nuclear matter, are\nof great importance for far ranging issues like neutrino oscillations\nand the synthesis of the elements. Another topic which is of crucial\nimportance for coming experimental programs is the link between the\nstructure and the dynamics of nuclei, with topics like reactions in\nmedium-mass nuclei and the derivation of for example optical\npotentials using present many-body methods.\n\nFinally we would like to point out an unresolved challenge to our\nmany-body methods. For any \\emph{ab initio} calculation to be truly\nmeaningful, uncertainties at all levels of the calculation needs to be\nquantified. There are recent advancements in the quantification of\nsystematic and statistical uncertainties of the employed Hamiltonian\n\\cite{carlsson2015,epelbaum2015,perez2015} and of employing Bayesian\nstatistics in nuclear\nEFTs~\\cite{schindler2009,furnstahl2014c,furnstahl2015,coelloperez2015b}. Propagation\nof these uncertainties from the underlying Hamiltonian to the nuclear\nmany-body problem are underway \\cite{ekstrom2015b,lynn2015}. Besides\nuncertainties in the employed Hamiltonian, many-body methods auch as\ncoupled-cluster theory rely on an expansion using a finite\nsingle-particle basis. Finite basis truncations introduces another\nuncertainty which needs to be quantified. Recently formulas for\ninfrared and ultraviolet extrapolations of binding energies, radii and\nquadrupole moments based on a harmonic oscillator basis in few- and\nmany-body systems were derived\n\\cite{furnstahl2012,coon2012,more2013,furnstahl2014,furnstahl2014b,konig2014,wendt2015,odell2015}.\nWe also mention that for specific systems like quantum dots using\neffective interactions, precise error estimates for a given truncation\nof the harmonic oscillator basis may also be given, see for example\nRef.~\\cite{kvaal2009}. Finally, there is a systematic uncertainty\nrelated to the specific truncation of the applied many-body method.\nThis uncertainty is perhaps the most challenging and difficult to\naddress, with first steps made for the coupled-cluster\ntruncation~\\cite{kutzelnigg1991,rohwedder2013}. Although most many-body methods are\nsubject to systematic improvements and controlled approximations, a\nrigorous theory for the convergence with respect to truncation level\nis an unresolved and open problem.\n\n\n\\ack We thank W.
