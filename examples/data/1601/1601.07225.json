Because of its low-cost and\nnon-invasiveness, the EGG technique has a great appeal as a\nclinical tool. Numerous studies had been conducted in order to\nclassify EGG recordings of surgically produced gastric electrical\nuncoupling in large experimental animals. Such studies included\nexamination of the level of randomness~\\cite{Mintchev:1998}, the\nlevel of chaos~\\cite{Carre:2001}, biomagnetic field\npatterns~\\cite{Bradshaw99,Bradshaw03,Bradshaw2003}, and dominant\nfrequency dynamics~\\cite{Mintchev:97}.\n\n\nSeparately, refined signal processing techniques, such as\nwavelets, have been employed to analyze\nelectrogastrograms~\\cite{Xie98,Ryu:02,Liang96,Liang02,Qiao96}.\nThis approach has been used to\n(i) propose new wavelets that can offer a better time-frequency localization of\nEGG signals~\\cite{Xie98,Ryu:02};\n(ii) perform noise detection in EGG recordings~\\cite{Liang96};\n(iii) reduce stimulus artefacts~\\cite{Liang02};\nand\n(iv) characterize global gastric electrical dysrhythmias~\\cite{Qiao96}.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the present study, a new application of wavelets for EGG analysis\nin detecting gastric electrical uncoupling and local dysrhythmias is proposed.\nIt is hypothesized that normal and uncoupled EGG recordings have different\ntypical energy distribution throughout their wavelet transform coefficients.\nThus, the quality assessment parameters of compressed normal and uncoupled electrogastrograms\nwould be different,\nsince distinct amounts of energy would be used in the signal reconstruction.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this study is to present a method to quantitatively\ndetect mild and severe gastric electrical uncoupling using wavelet compression in a canine model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Methods}\n\n\\subsection{Experimental Setup}\n\nAfter a laparotomy and the instalment of six pairs of internal\nsubserosal stainless steel wire electrodes into the antral gastric\nwall of sixteen acute dogs (seven female and nine male), two complete circumferential cuts were\nmade fully dividing the organ into separate sections, but preserving the blood supply in each.\nAfter each cut, the stomach was not anastomosed.\nThe sites of the cuts were selected to be distal to the\ngastro-esophageal junction (first cut) and proximal to\ngastro-esophageal junction (second cut). Consequently, by the\nend of the experiment, these circular myotomies divided the\nstomach in three parts of approximately equal dimensions.\nSimilar type of experimental work was described before~\\cite{Mintchev:97,Mintchev:1998,Carre:2001}.\n\n\n\nAfter each incision, the abdominal wall was closed and five standard\ndisposable neonatal electrocardiography Ag-AgCl electrodes (Conmed,\nAndover Medical, Haverhill, MA, USA) were collinearly placed on the\nabdominal wall along the projection of the gastric axis. Additionally a\nreference electrode was positioned in the area of the hip. Previous\nstudies demonstrated that this electrode configuration can be regarded as\noptimal~\\cite{Mirizzi:1983}. The five active electrodes were\ngrouped to provide eight bipolar EGG channels. Furthermore, six\nstainless-steel wire electrodes implanted subserosally provided six\nbipolar channels of internal GEA. However, in the present study only the\neight EGG recordings were processed, while the internal GEA channels were\nused as a visual reference only to verify that normal electrical activity\nwas present.

according\nto the state of the dog (basal, mild uncoupling, and severe uncoupling) and the recording channel.\nSignificant statistical difference ($p<0.05$)\nbetween the\n${\\mbox{PRD}}$ values\nof compressed EGG signals\nobtained from\nthe basal state and mild or severe gastric electrical uncoupling\nfor a given channel was sought.\n\n\nSince the EGG signals of the three groups were acquired from the\nsame sixteen dogs, the assumption of data independence\ncould be questioned.\nConsequently, a small-sample inference using\nstraightforward $t$-statistics might not be appropriate~\\cite{Snedecor97}.\n\nPaired statistical approaches, such as the Paired Difference test~\\cite{Snedecor97},\nwere utilized to\ncompare the ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ between two given groups of signals.\nTherefore, paired differences of the\n${\\mbox{PRD}}$'s ($\\Delta{\\mbox{PRD}}$) were computed.\nSince Paired Difference test can only be used when\nthe relative frequency distribution of the\npopulation of differences is normal,\nthe nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test\ncould also be taken in consideration as an alternative~\\cite{Snedecor97}.\n\nTo check the assumption of normal distribution of the $\\Delta{\\mbox{PRD}}$ samples,\nthe Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test of normality was utilized~\\cite{Gonzalez1977}.\nWhenever Lilliefors test verified that the\ndifference between the samples satisfied a normal distribution,\nthe Paired Difference test was utilized to compare the two groups.\nOtherwise, the less restrictive Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Choice of Parameters}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Number of Scales}\n\\label{number_of_scales}\n\nIn order to select the number of scales $J_0 \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}$\nof the wavelet transform decomposition,\nthe following criterion was introduced:~$J_0$\nwas chosen so that the coarsest approximation\nscale\nhad a pseudo-frequency close to the\ncanine EGG dominant frequency $f_c$\nof 4--6 cycles per minute~\\cite{Mintchev:2000}.\n\nThe pseudo-frequency $f_{\\mbox{pseudo}}$ of a given scale~$j$ is\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 19658, "prevtext": "\nwhere $N$ and $M$ are the number of wavelet transform coefficients of\nthe original and the compressed signals, respectively.\n\n\n\nThus all three parameters\nin a wavelet compression scheme have been defined:\n(i) the number of scales;\n(ii) the compression ratio;\nand\n(iii) the type of the wavelet.\nHowever, before deriving\napproaches to determine each of these parameters,\nsome additional issues need to be addressed.\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Measurement of Distortion}\n\n\nThe suggested assumption is\nthat the normal and uncoupled EGG recordings\nhave different typical energy distributions\nthroughout the wavelet coefficients.\nThus, depending on the signal (coupled or uncoupled), its energy\nis distributed differently\namong the wavelet transform coefficients.\nIf the energy of the signal is spread evenly\nthroughout the coefficients,\nfixing the number of discarded coefficients\nwould result in greater distortions.\nBy contrast, if the energy of the signal is concentrated\nin few wavelet coefficients,\nthe odds are that they would survive the compression\nprocess, and\nconsequently, the reconstructed signal would be closer to the original.\nHence,\nfor a fixed compression ratio,\nreconstructed signals\npresent different distortions,\ndepending on their energy distribution in\nthe wavelet domain.\n\n\n\nTherefore, to further the present analysis, it is necessary to introduce\na quality assessment tool\nto compare the original discrete signal~$\\mathbf{x}$\nwith its reconstruction~$\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}$.\nSeveral measures that allow the\nevaluation of the effect of compression schemes\nhave been suggested~\\cite{Besar:00}.\nHowever, one of the most commonly used is\nthe Percent Root-mean-square Difference\n(${\\mbox{PRD}}$)~\\cite{Chagas:00,Besar:00,Lu:99},\nwhich was utilized in the present study\nas a measure of distortion\nin the compression scheme.\nThe ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ of two signals,

Ratio}\n\\label{cr_section}\n\n\nThe selection of the compression ratio\nwas performed by\nchoosing the ratio that maximized the number of channels\nwhich\nexhibited statistically significant difference,\nwhen comparing the basal to the uncoupled groups of signals.\nIn order to facilitate the selection process,\na plot was constructed relating\nthe compression ratio\nto\nthe percentage of channels in which statistically significant\ndifference was observed.\nThis calculation was performed for two situations:\n(i) comparing basal state to mild electrical uncoupling;\nand\n(ii) comparing basal state to severe electrical uncoupling.\nThus,\nthe values of the compression ratio\nthat delivered maximal percentage of detecting channels in both comparison cases\nwere selected.\n\n\nIn this study, three well-known wavelets were utilized,\nnamely, Daubechies-2, -3, and Coiflet-1.\nThe number of scales utilized was set accordingly (see Table~\\ref{pseudo}).\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Choice of Wavelet}\n\n\n\nAlthough there are numerous issues concerning\nthe choice of wavelet for signal analysis~\\cite{Chapa2000},\ngenerally,\na wavelet is better suited to a class of signals\nif the latter can be represented by\nas few wavelet coefficients as possible~\\cite{Mallat:03,Vetterli:2001}.\nThus, wavelets which resemble the waveshape of the signal under analysis are often selected.\nIn the context of the present study,\na wavelet was sought that minimized\nthe ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ between the original EGG signal and its reconstruction\nfor a fixed compression ratio.\nIf,\n for a given wavelet,\n   the ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ associated with a compressed signal was minimal,\nthen\n the surviving coefficients were considered to be\n better representing the original signal.\nTherefore,\nthe selected wavelet was also more effectively ``matched''\nto the signal under analysis when compared to other wavelets in consideration.\nHowever, the abundance of wavelets~\\cite{Bratteli}\nmakes such approach prohibitive.\nAs a result, some constraints on the choice of  wavelet were introduced.\n\nIt is well known that wavelets can be generated from\ndiscrete finite impulse response (FIR) filters~\\cite{MisiMisi00}.\nIn the present work, the analysis was limited to\nwavelets generated by FIR\nfilters with length no greater than six coefficients.\nIn this subset of wavelets one may find Haar, Daubechies-2, Daubechies-3, and Coiflet-1 wavelets,\nto name the most popular ones~\\cite{Mallat:03}.\n\n\nThis restriction is quite convenient, since all FIR filters of length up to six\nthat can be utilized to generate wavelets have simple parameterizations\nof their coefficients~\\cite{Tew1992,Zhou1993}.\nFor example, Pollen parameterization of 6-tap wavelet filters~\\cite{Tew1992}\nhas two independent variables $(a,b)\\in[-\\pi,\\pi]\\times [-\\pi,\\pi]$.\nVarying these two parameters,\na filter that generates a new wavelet can be defined.\nConsequently, the Pollen parameterization defines a plane on which every\npoint is connected to a wavelet~\\cite{Bratteli}.\nIn Figure~\\ref{ab_plane}, the parameterization plane is partially\ndepicted and some wavelet positions are denoted.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\linewidth]{ab_plane.pdf}\n\\caption{Parameterization plane (the axes are normalized by $\\pi$).\nThe coordinate points\nthat correspond to Haar ($\\ast$),\nDaubechies-2 ($\\times$),\nDaubechies-3 ($\\bullet$),\nand\nCoiflet-1 ($\\triangle$) wavelets are shown.}\n\\label{ab_plane}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\nUsing the discussed compression scheme,\none can compute a~${\\mbox{PRD}}$ value of a signal for each wavelet\ngenerated from a point with coordinates~$(a,b)$ on the\nparameterization plane.\nDoing so, a surface can be defined by the points~$(a,b,{\\mbox{PRD}})$.\nThus, the minima of this surface correspond to the\npoint coordinates~$(a,b)$ that generate a wavelet with good ``matching''\nproperties, since the ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ values at these minima are small.\nOn the other hand, the maxima of this surface indicate higher values of\n${\\mbox{PRD}}$, consequently the reconstructed signal from the compression\nis a poorer representation of the original.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Testing the Methodology}\n\nTo verify the validity of the proposed methodology, it was applied\nto a square wave signal shown in Figure~\\ref{staircase}. It has\nbeen previously shown that the Haar wavelet matches this kind of\nsignal and can offer a good representation~\\cite{Oliveira:04}.\nSetting the compression ratio to~3 and the number of scales to~6,\na ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ surface on the parameterization plane was constructed,\nresulting in the plot shown in Figure~\\ref{stair_prd}. A minimum\nof this surface occurs at the point  $(\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, which\ncorresponds exactly to the Haar wavelet. Other minima are located\non $(\\pi/2, -\\pi/2)$, $(\\pi/2, 0)$, $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, $(-\\pi/2,\n0)$, and on the diagonal. All these regions also generate\nHaar-like wavelets. Therefore, the proposed procedure of finding\nthe minima of the ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ surface could be applied to every EGG\nrecording in the basal state, and a wavelet that would ``match''\nnormal EGG recordings could be defined. As a result, a set of\npoint coordinates $(a_i, b_i)$ could be determined on the\nparameterization plane, which minimizes the ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ for each normal\ncanine EGG recording~$i$. Figure~\\ref{prd-plane} shows typical\nsurfaces generated for basal canine EGG signals~\\cite{Gopi1994}.\n\n\n\n\nTaking the mean value of the minima,\nthe best wavelet parameterization $(a^\\ast, b^\\ast)$ could be defined.\nThus,\n$(a^\\ast,b^\\ast)$\ngenerates a wavelet that on average\n``matches'' best the normal EGG recordings.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{square-like.pdf}\n\\caption{Square-wave test signal of random

${\\mbox{PRD}}$ values for all EGG recordings were computed\nusing some selected wavelets (Daubechies-2, Daubechies-3, and Coiflet-1)\nand several compression ratios.\nHaar wavelet was not taken into consideration because it is not continuous,\nand offers poor approximations for smooth functions like the~EGG signals~\\cite{Mallat:03}.\nFigure~\\ref{cr_vs_sens} shows the results of this procedure.\n\n\nIt is interesting to observe that percentage of channels\nin which statistically significant difference was found\nis highly dependent on the choice of compression ratio\nwhen comparing basal state and mild gastric electrical uncoupling groups.\nAs the compression ratio increased,\nthe resulting ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ sets from\nthe two groups\nbecame statistically less distinct,\ndeteriorating the ability to discriminate between them.\nFigure~\\ref{cr_vs_sens}(a) illustrates this behaviour.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\subfigure[Basal vs. Mild Electrical Uncoupling]{\\includegraphics[width=0.41\\linewidth]{group-ab.pdf}}\n\\quad\n\\subfigure[Basal vs. Severe Electrical Uncoupling]{\\includegraphics[width=0.41\\linewidth]{group-ac.pdf}}\n\\caption{Compression ratio vs percentage of\nchannels in which successful detection occurred ($p<0.05$).\nEach curve displays the analysis for a specific wavelet:\nDaubechies-2 (thin solid line),\nDaubechies-3 (solid line),\nand\nCoiflet-1 (dotted line).}\n\\label{cr_vs_sens}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nOn the other hand, the proposed algorithm is more prone to detect\nsevere electrical uncoupling.\nSignificant statistical difference ($p<0.044$)\nbetween\nbasal state and severe electrical uncoupling\nwas observed in up to~6 out of~8 channels.\nMoreover, the percentage of channels where\nsignificance\nwas consistently observed was relatively\nconstant with respect to\nthe change of compression ratio (Figure~\\ref{cr_vs_sens}(b)).\n\nEvidently, depending on the choice of wavelet,\ncompression ratio range between 3 and 5\noffered the best outcomes for both cases.\nTherefore, compression ratio of~3 was selected,\nwhich was the smallest compression ratio\nwith which both plots achieved maximum values.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Wavelet}\n\nSetting the compression ratio to three, the specific values of $a^\\ast = 0.43$\nand $b^\\ast = -0.26$ were determined, which were associated\nwith\nthe wavelet depicted in Figure~\\ref{best_wavelet} (bold curve).\nIt is worth mentioning that the proposed wavelet was\nvery similar to the classic Daubechies-3 wavelet.\nSince Daubechies-3 is\n(i)~very similar to the proposed wavelet;\nand\n(ii)~easily available in many software packages\n(e.g., {\\sc Matlab} (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA)),\nit was chosen instead of the proposed wavelet.\nPrevious empirical findings~\\cite{Ryu:02} confirm this observation.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\linewidth]{db3_opt.pdf}\n\\caption{Comparison between the optimal wavelet (solid bold curve) obtained using the\nderived

the employed model of gastric electrical uncoupling,\nas the myotomies were performed\nthe electrical power produced by the intrinsic gastric generator\nwas divided into two or three generators of lower electric power,\naccording to the number of the circumferential cuts.\nConsequently, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the recorded signal decreased\nand the influence of various external sources of disturbance became more expressive.\nTherefore, the energy of the EGG signal became\nmore distributed throughout the wavelet coefficients, when compared to the signal\nin the basal state (single gastric generator).\nDue to the design of the proposed method,\nas the energy was distributed in more coefficients,\nthe reconstruction error increased.\n\n\nThe evaluation of the reconstruction error of  compressed canine EGG signals\nusing the proposed wavelet technique was able to discriminate\nbetween induced\nsevere gastric electrical uncoupling\nand the basal state\nin 75\\%~of the EGG channels.\nThe detection capability of the procedure was reduced when\ncomparing the control group to the mild gastric uncoupling group\nbut nevertheless,\nsignificant differences were observed in 4~out of 8~EGG channels\n(see Tables~\\ref{ab_db3_cr3} and~\\ref{ac_db3_cr3}).\nThis increase in sensitivity when detecting severe uncoupling is expected\nand reinforce previous findings~\\cite{Mintchev:97,SanMiguel:1999,Carre:2001}.\nChannels 8, 11 and 12 were recognized as the ones that presented\nthe best overall performance in detecting uncoupling signals\n($p$-values ranging from $0.0009$ to $0.01$).\nThe site of such channels oversees the\nmid to distal corpus of the\nepigastric region.\nThese electrode locations probably encompass\nfully electrical activity from all uncoupling regions.\nThis observation emphasizes the appropriateness of using\na multichannel EGG recording system.\n\n\n\nA careful examination of Table~\\ref{ac_db3_cr3} reveals that channels~9 and~13\nhave only borderline significance.\nA more conservative interpretation of the data (e.g., $p<0.01$)\nwould reduce the ability of the method to detect mild uncoupling\nto a single channel~(\\#11),\nwhich,\nhowever,\nstill represents a significant improvement in recognizing mild uncoupling,\ncompared to previous findings~\\cite{SanMiguel:1999}.\n\n\nMild and severe gastric electrical uncoupling groups were statistically indistinguishable\n($p>0.05$).\nThis indicates that, according to the proposed technique,\nEGG signals contain insufficient information\nto assess the level of gastric electrical uncoupling.\nIn addition, when comparing mild and severe uncoupling,\na non-consistent tendency of change in the reconstruction error\nwas observed.\nThis can be noted from the fluctuation of the sign of\nthe mean reconstruction error in Table~\\ref{bc_db3_cr3}.\n\n\n\nPrevious works~\\cite{Carre:2001,SanMiguel:1999,Mintchev:1998,Mintchev:97}\nsuggested that determinism, randomness, and\nchaos are dynamically blended in the EGG signals. The present\ninvestigation indicates that a single signal processing approach might be\ninsufficient to provide an accurate assessment method for EGG recordings.\nBecause of the complex dynamic nature of the EGG signal, various methods\nsuch as classical time-frequency analysis, wavelet theory, non-linear\ntechniques, and biomagnetic field pattern recognition could be combined to\nprovide sufficent data for an informed diagnostic decision. Indeed, such\ncombined approach could be a key to converting electrogastrography into a\nreliable clinical tool.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nA new wavelet analysis approach based on signal compression\nis proposed for the detection of mild and severe gastric electrical\nuncoupling in a canine model.\nCombining the results of the suggested wavelet compression scheme\nwith a multichannel recording system and\na comprehensive electrode configuration mapping the\nabdominal wall along the projection of the gastric axis,\nit was demonstrated that significant\ndifference between the basal state and gastric electrical uncoupling\ncan be detected in particular EGG channels.\nThese channels are\nusually located along the abdominal projection of the\nmid to distal corpus axis.\n\n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nThis work was supported by\nthe Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)\nand the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq, Brazil).\n\n\n\n{\\small\n\\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}\n\\bibliography{wavelet}\n}\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 22019, "prevtext": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Statistical Analysis}\n\\label{section_stats}\n\n\nAfter computing the quality assessment parameter (${\\mbox{PRD}}$) for each canine EGG signal,\nthe signals were grouped according\nto the state of the dog (basal, mild uncoupling, and severe uncoupling) and the recording channel.\nSignificant statistical difference ($p<0.05$)\nbetween the\n${\\mbox{PRD}}$ values\nof compressed EGG signals\nobtained from\nthe basal state and mild or severe gastric electrical uncoupling\nfor a given channel was sought.\n\n\nSince the EGG signals of the three groups were acquired from the\nsame sixteen dogs, the assumption of data independence\ncould be questioned.\nConsequently, a small-sample inference using\nstraightforward $t$-statistics might not be appropriate~\\cite{Snedecor97}.\n\nPaired statistical approaches, such as the Paired Difference test~\\cite{Snedecor97},\nwere utilized to\ncompare the ${\\mbox{PRD}}$ between two given groups of signals.\nTherefore, paired differences of the\n${\\mbox{PRD}}$'s ($\\Delta{\\mbox{PRD}}$) were computed.\nSince Paired Difference test can only be used when\nthe relative frequency distribution of the\npopulation of differences is normal,\nthe nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test\ncould also be taken in consideration as an alternative~\\cite{Snedecor97}.\n\nTo check the assumption of normal distribution of the $\\Delta{\\mbox{PRD}}$ samples,\nthe Lilliefors (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) test of normality was utilized~\\cite{Gonzalez1977}.\nWhenever Lilliefors test verified that the\ndifference between the samples satisfied a normal distribution,\nthe Paired Difference test was utilized to compare the two groups.\nOtherwise, the less restrictive Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Choice of Parameters}\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Number of Scales}\n\\label{number_of_scales}\n\nIn order to select the number of scales $J_0 \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}$\nof the wavelet transform decomposition,\nthe following criterion was introduced:~$J_0$\nwas chosen so that the coarsest approximation\nscale\nhad a pseudo-frequency close to the\ncanine EGG dominant frequency $f_c$\nof 4--6 cycles per minute~\\cite{Mintchev:2000}.\n\nThe pseudo-frequency $f_{\\mbox{pseudo}}$ of a given scale~$j$ is\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nf_{\\mbox{pseudo}}\n=\n\\frac{f_\\psi}{j \\cdot T_s},\\qquad j=1,\\ldots,J,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"f_{\\mbox{pseudo}}=\\frac{f_{\\psi}}{j\\cdot T_{s}},\\qquad j=1,\\ldots,J,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mtext>pseudo</mtext></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>\u03c8</mi></msub><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><msub><mi>T</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow><mo rspace=\"22.5pt\">,</mo><mrow><mi>j</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">\u2026</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>J</mi></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
