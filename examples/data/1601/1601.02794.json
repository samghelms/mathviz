This relationship \n may  take the form of either \\emph{exact} Bohrification, in which one studies commutative unital C*-subalgebras of a given noncommutative C*-algebra, or  \\emph{asymptotic} Bohrification, which involves deformations of commutative {C*-algebra} s into noncommutative ones. Implementing the doctrine of classical concepts, exact Bohrification  is an appropriate framework for the Kochen--Specker Theorem and for (intuitionistic) quantum logic, culminating in the topos-theoretic approach to {quantum mechanics}\\ that has been developed since 1998. \nAsymptotic Bohrification was inspired by the correspondence principle and forms the right conceptual and mathematical framework for the explanation of the emergence of the classical world from quantum theory (incorporating the\n measurement problem and the closely related issue of spontaneous symmetry breaking). \n The  Born rule may be derived  from both exact and  asymptotic Bohrification, which  reflects\n the Janus faces of probability as applying to individual random events and to relative frequencies, respectively.\n\nWe review the history, the goals, and the achievements of this program so far. \n\\end{abstract}\n\\maketitle\n\\begin{small}\n\\begin{quote}\n \\tableofcontents\n\\end{quote}\n\\end{small}\n\\clearpage\n\\newpage\n\\section{Introduction}\\label{sec1}\nDespite considerable research (e.g.\\ Joos et al, 2003; Schlosshauer, 2007; Landsman, 2007; Wallace, 2012), it remains  unclear how\nquantum mechanics---accepted as the fundamental theory of the physical world---gives rise to  classical physics, or at least to the appearance thereof. The relationship between classical and quantum physics played a fundamental role in the work of Niels Bohr, who contributed two important ideas (or perhaps ideologies):\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The  \\emph{correspondence principle} (Bohr, 1976),  which---originally in the context of atomic radiation---suggested an asymptotic relationship between classical and quantum mechanics (see also Mehra \\& Rechenberg, 1982;  Hendry, 1984; Darrigol, 1992);\n\\item The \\emph{doctrine of classical concepts}, which Bohr succinctly summarized  as follows:\n \\begin{quotation}\n `However far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation, the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms. (\\ldots) The argument is simply that by the word \\emph{experiment} we refer to a situation where we can tell others what we have done and what we have learned and that, therefore, the account of the experimental arrangements and of the results of the observations must be expressed in unambiguous language with suitable application of the terminology of classical physics.' (Bohr, 1949, p.\\ 209). \n\\end{quotation}\nIn brief, the only way to look at the quantum world is through classical glasses. \nSee also Bohr (1985, 1996), as well as Scheibe (1973), Folse (1985),  Camilleri \\& Schlosshauer (2015), and Zinkernagel (2016) for further analysis  (which we recommend but shall not review, Bohr's role in this work being that of an inspirator rather than a subject of exegesis---we will similarly not discuss (anti-)realism etc.). \n\\end{itemize}\nThe tension between these ideas was  well  captured by Landau \\& Lifshitz (1977, p.\\ 3):\n \\begin{quotation}\n`Thus {quantum mechanics}\\ occupies a very unusual place among physical theories: it contains classical mechanics as a limiting case, yet at the same time it requires this limiting case for its own formulation.' \n\\end{quotation} \nWhat adds to the difficulties is the need to combine conceptual and mathematical analysis, but precisely at this point the approach we advocate promises a clean separation between the two:  the necessary conceptual analysis has largely been performed by Bohr,  whilst von Neumann's theory of operator algebras---as extended to {C*-algebra} s (Gelfand \\& Naimark, 1943) and subsequently to\nnoncommutative geometry (Connes, 1994)---provides the required mathematical tools. What has been lacking so far is a relationship between the two, and this is what our ``Bohrification'' program intends to provide. Indeed, we feel that \n each author  on his own failed to solve the foundational problems of {quantum mechanics}:  Bohr's  conceptual ideas must first be interpreted within the formalism of {quantum mechanics}\\ before they can be applied to the physical world (an intermediate step Bohr himself seems to have considered of little interest, if not wholly superfluous), whereas conversely, von Neumann's brilliant mathematical work needs to be supplemented by sound conceptual moves before it, too, may be related to actual physics. Von Neumann (1932) did write down the most general form of the Born rule, which is an important link between physics and the  {Hilbert space}\\  formalism of {quantum mechanics}\\ he developed, but this is not nearly enough;  what we propose is that Bohr provided these conceptual moves.\n \nIn this respect, Bohr and von Neumann historically played asymmetric roles: whereas Bohr hardly attempted to to relate his ideas to the mathematical formalism of {quantum mechanics}\\ (not even to Dirac's),  von Neumann (1932) famously did spend a great deal of attention to conceptual issues in {quantum mechanics}. Although this work  was extremely influential, and von Neumann's  analysis of  hidden variables did set the stage for part of our Bohrification program (albeit in a contrapositive way), his work on entropy or the measurement problem has had little influence on the program proposed here.  \n In any case,  von Neumann never advocated the particular use of commutative  operator algebras we now see as the basis of the relationship between his mathematics and the real world---seen through the classical glasses suggested  by Bohr's doctrine. \n In any case, although  Bohr and von Neumann tend to be jointly bracketed  under the Copenhagen Interpretation---a notion to be treated with due reservation (Faye, 2002; Howard, 2004; Camilleri, 2007)---a synthesis of their ideas on {quantum mechanics}\\ is difficult to find in earlier literature.\nThe central idea of Bohrification is to interpret Bohr's  doctrine mathematically, as follows: \n\\begin{trivlist}\n\\item[] \\emph{In so far as their physical relevance is concerned, the noncommutative operator algebras of quantum-mechanical observables are accessible only through commutative algebras.}\n\\end{trivlist}\n\n On this interpretation, the Bohrification program splits into two parts, distinguished by the specific relationship between a given \n noncommutative operator algebra $A$ (whose self-adjoint elements mathematically represent the observables of some quantum system) and the commutative algebras that supposedly give access to $A$. Either way, we assume that $A$ is a {C*-algebra}: this is an associative algebra (over ${\\mathbb C})$ equipped with an involution (i.e.,  a real-linear map\n$A\\rightarrow A^*$ such that  $a^{**} =  a$, $(ab)^*  = b^* a^*$, and $({\\lambda} a)^*  =\n{\\overline}{{\\lambda}}a^*$ for all $a,b\\in{A}$ and ${\\lambda}\\in{\\mathbb C}$), as well as a norm in which $A$ is complete (i.e., a Banach space),  such that algebra, involution, and norm are related by the axioms $\\|ab\\|\\,\\leq\\, \\| a\\|\\,\\| b\\|$ and $\\|a^*a\\|  =  \\| a\\|^2$. The two main classes of {C*-algebra} s are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The space $C_0(X)$ of all  continuous functions $f:X\\rightarrow{\\mathbb C}$  that vanish at\ninfinity (i.e., \n for any  ${\\varepsilon}>0$ the set $\\{x\\in X\\mid |f(x)|\\geq {\\varepsilon}\\}$ is compact),  where $X$ is some locally compact Hausdorff space, with pointwise  addition and\nmultiplication, involution  $f^*(x)={\\overline}{f(x)}$,\nand a  norm $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}=\\sup_{x\\in X} \\{|f(x)|\\}$.\nIt is of fundamental importance for physics and mathematics that\n $C_0(X)$ is \\emph{commutative}. Conversely,  Gelfand \\& Naimark (1943) proved that every commutative {C*-algebra}\\ is isomorphic to $C_0(X)$ for some  locally compact Hausdorff  space $X$, which is uniquely determined by $A$ up to homeomorphism ($X$ is called the \\emph{Gelfand spectrum} of $A$). \n Note that $C_0(X)$ has a unit (namely the function $1_X$ that is equal to 1 for any $x$) iff $X$ is compact.\n   \\item \n   Norm-closed subalgebras $A$ of the space $B(H)$  of all bounded operators on some {Hilbert space}\\ $H$\n   for which $a^*\\in A$ iff $a\\in A$; this includes the case $A=B(H)$. Here one uses  the standard operator norm $\\|a\\|=\\sup\\{\\|a\\psi\\|, {\\psi}\\in H, \\|\\psi\\|=1\\}$,  the algebraic operations are the natural ones, and the\n involution is the adjoint (i.e., hermitian conjugate). \n  If $\\dim(H)>1$, $B(H)$ is a  \\emph{non-commutative} {C*-algebra}. \n  \n  An important special case is the {C*-algebra}\\ \n $B_0(H)$ of all \\emph{compact} operators on  $H$, which fails to have a unit whenever $H$ is infinite-dimensional \n (whereas $B(H)$ is always unital). In their fundamental paper, Gelfand \\& Naimark (1943) also proved that every  {C*-algebra}\\ is isomorphic to $A\\subset B(H)$ for some  {Hilbert space}\\ space $X$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThese two classes are related as follows: in the commutative case $A= C_0(X)$, one may \n take $H=L^2(X,\\mu)$ (where the measure $\\mu$ is supported by all \n of $X$), on which $C_0(X)$ acts by multiplication operators, that is, $m_f\\psi=f\\psi$, where  $f\\in C_0(X)$ and $\\psi\\in L^2(X,\\mu)$.\n\n{C*-algebra} s were introduced by  Gelfand \\& Naimark (1943), generalizing the rings of operators studied by von Neumann  during the period 1929--1949, partly in collaboration with Murray \n (von Neumann, 1929, 1931, 1938, 1940, 1949; Murray \\& von Neumann, 1936, 1937, 1943). These rings \n are now aptly called \\emph{{von Neumann algebra} s}, and arise as the special case where a {C*-algebra}\\ $A\\subset B(H)$ satisfies $A=A''$, in which for any subset $S\\subset B(H)$ we define the \\emph{commutant} of $S$ by $S'=\\{a\\in B(H)\\mid ab=ba\\,\\forall\\, b\\in S\\}$, and\nthe \\emph{bicommutant} of $S$ as  $S''=(S')'$. A \\emph{state} on a {C*-algebra}\\ $A$  is a linear map ${\\omega}:A\\rightarrow{\\mathbb C}$ that is \\emph{positive} in that ${\\omega}(a^*a)\\geq 0$ for each $a\\in A$, and \\emph{normalized} in that, first noting that positivity implies boundedness, $\\|{\\omega}\\|=1$, where $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is the usual norm on the Banach dual $A^*$ (if $A$ has a unit $1_A$, then the latter condition is equivalent to\n${\\omega}(1_A)=1$). The Riesz--Radon representation theorem in measure theory gives a bijective correspondence between states\n ${\\omega}$ on $A=C_0(X)$ and  probability measures $\\mu$ on $X$,  given by ${\\omega}(f)=\\int_X d\\mu\\, f$, for any  $f\\in C(X)$.\nIf $A=B(H)$, then any density operator ${\\rho}$ on $H$ gives a state ${\\omega}$ on $B(H)$ by ${\\omega}(a)={\\mbox{\\rm Tr}\\,}({\\rho} a)$, but if $H$ is infinite-dimensional there are interesting other states, too, cf.\\ \\S\\S\\ref{GKS},\\ref{KSC}.\n See Kadison \\& Ringrose (1983, 1986) for a first introduction to operator algebras.\n\nThe use of {C*-algebra}\\ and {von Neumann algebra} s in mathematical physics has been widespread for over half a century now,  typically in the context of quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom (Bratteli \\&  Robinson, 1981; Haag, 1992). More recently, it has become clear that they also form an effective tool when other limiting operations play a role, such as $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$, where $\\hbar$ is Planck's constant (Rieffel, 1989, 1994; Landsman, 1998), see also below.  Returning to our main topic of Bohrification, both of these applications of {C*-algebra} s have now found a common conceptual umbrella:  \n \\begin{itemize}   \n \\item  \\emph{Asymptotic  Bohrification} looks at commutative C*-algebras asymptotically included in $A$ by a deformation procedure involving so-called continuous fields of C*-algebras (see appendix). As we shall see, this covers the Born rule (in its frequency interpretation), \n  the measurement problem (which we  relate to  the  classical limit of {quantum mechanics}), and the closely related issue of spontaneous symmetry breaking. All of this may be bracketed under the general theme of emergence\n  (Landsman, 2013).\n\\item  \\emph{Exact  Bohrification}  studies commutative C*-algebras contained in $A$, assembled into a poset (i.e., partially ordered set) ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ whose partial ordering is given by set-theoretic inclusion (for technical reasons we assume that $A$ has a unit $1_A$ and that each commutative C*-subalgebra $C\\in{\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ of $A$ contains $1_A$). Applications to the foundations of {quantum mechanics}\\ so far include the  Born rule (for single experiments), the Kochen--Specker Theorem, and (intuitionistic) quantum logic.  The topos-theoretic approach to {quantum mechanics}\\ (which incorporates the last two themes just mentioned) is heavily based on ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$, and also, in a purely mathematical setting, ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ turns out to be a useful new tool for the classification of {C*-algebra} s.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n The conceptual roots of the exact Bohrification program  lie in Bohr's doctrine of classical concepts, but the mathematical interpretation of this doctrine as proposed here starts with\n von Neumann's (1932) proof that (in current parlance) non-contextual linear hidden variables compatible with  {quantum mechanics}\\ do not exist;\n see Caruana (1995) for historical context.  Von Neumann's  assumption of linearity of the hidden variable on all operators was criticized by Hermann (1935), whose work was unfortunately ignored, and subsequently by  Bell (1966), whose paper  became well known.  Both Bell (1966) and Kochen \\& Specker (1967) then obtained a similar result to von Neumann's on the assumption of linearity merely on \\emph{commuting} operators. \n Furthermore,  responding to different ideas in von Neumann (1932), the mathematician Mackey (1957) introduced probability measures $\\mu$ on the closed subspaces of a {Hilbert space}, based on an additivity assumption on mutually orthogonal subspaces.\n These formed the basis of his colleague Gleason's (1957) deservedly famous characterization of such measures in terms of density operators.\n \n As we shall explain in \\S\\ref{GKS},  \\emph{commutative} C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$ form an appropriate context for Mackey, Gleason, and Kochen--Specker; this shared background is no accident, since the  Kochen--Specker Theorem is a simple corollary of Gleason's. Moreover, Kadison \\& Singer (1959) studied pure states on \\emph{maximal} commutative C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$, launching what became known as the \\emph{Kadison--Singer conjecture}, which we also regard as a founding influence on  the (exact) Bohrification program.  \nTwo decades later, the reinterpretation of the  Kochen--Specker Theorem in the language of topos theory led Isham \\& Butterfield (1998), Hamilton, Isham, \\& Butterfield (2000), and D\\\"{o}ring \\& Isham (2010)  to  a poset similar to ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ in the setting of {von Neumann algebra} s (though with the opposite ordering). Finally, ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ was introduced by Heunen, Landsman \\& Spitters (2009), again in the context of topos theory. It soon became clear that even apart from the latter context ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ is an interesting object on its own, especially as a tool for analyzing C*-algebras. \n \n Asymptotic Bohrification conceptually originated in Bohr's correspondence principle, which originally related the statistical results of quantum theory to the classical theory of radiation in the limit of large quantum numbers  (Bohr, 1976), but was later generalized to the idea that classical physics should arise from quantum physics in some appropriate limit (Bokulich, 2008).\n Mathematically, the correspondence principle eventually gave rise to the field of \\emph{semiclassical analysis} (Ivrii, 1998; Martinez, 2002), and, more importantly for the present paper, to a\n  new approach to quantization theory developed in the 1970s under the name of \\emph{deformation quantization} (Berezin, 1975; Bayen et al, 1978).  Here  the noncommutative algebras characteristic of {quantum mechanics}\\ arise as deformations of so-called Poisson algebras; the underlying mathematical idea ultimately goes back to Dirac (1930). In Rieffel's (1989, 1994) approach to deformation quantization, the algebras in question are {C*-algebra} s and hence the entire apparatus of operator algebras---and of  the closely related field on noncommutative geometry (Connes, 1994)---becomes available. \n  \n  This led to a general operator-algebraic approach to (deformation) quantization and the classical limit of {quantum mechanics}\\ (Landsman, 1998), the scope of which was substantially enlarged in Landsman (2007, 2008) so as to deal with both the macroscopic limit  (i.e., $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, which also incorporates Bohr's original limit of large quantum numbers)\nand the semiclassical limit ($\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$) at one go. This, in turn, led to a new approach to the measurement problem (Landsman \\& Reuvers, 2013) and to spontaneous symmetry breaking (Landsman, 2013), which we now recognize as instances of  asymptotic Bohrification.\n\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. We first elaborate on the path alluded to above from von Neumann (1932) to the poset ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ and hence to exact Bohrification. Next, \n the Born rule provides a nice context for a first acquaintance with the Bohrification program in its two variants (i.e., exact and asymptotic), as it falls under both headings and hence may be understood from two rather different points of view.\nAfter an intermezzo on  conceptual issues with limits in the context of  asymptotic  Bohrification, we  end with an overview of our strategy for first (re)formulating and then solving the measurement problem. \n\nThis paper mainly concentrates on the Bohrification program in  physics.

Von Neumann (1932) introduced the  concept of an \\emph{Erwartung} (i.e., \\emph{expectation value}) as a linear map ${\\omega}':B(H)_{\\mathrm{sa}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb R}$ that satisfies ${\\omega}'(a^2)\\geq 0$ for each $a\\in B(H)_{\\mathrm{sa}}=\\{a\\in B(H)\\mid a^*=a\\}$, as well as ${\\omega}'(1_H)=1$.\nUsing the canonical decomposition $a=a'+ia''$, where now $a\\in B(H)$ and \n  $a'= {\\mbox{\\footnotesize $\\frac{1}{2}$}} (a+a^*)$ and $a''=-{\\mbox{\\footnotesize $\\frac{1}{2}$}} i(a-a^*)$ are self-adjoint, such a map ${\\omega}'$ may be extended to a linear map\n  ${\\omega}:B(H)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb C}$ by ${\\omega}(a)={\\omega}'(a')+i{\\omega}'(a'')$, which is positive in the equivalent sense that ${\\omega}(a^*a)\\geq 0$ for each $a\\in B(H)$, and still satisfies ${\\omega}(1_H)=1$. Thus ${\\omega}$ is a state in the modern sense, cf.\\ \\S\\ref{sec1}.\n   \nVon Neumann's controversial argument against hidden variables is a simply corollary of his characterization of states, which we review first.  As already mentioned in \\S\\ref{sec1}, if $H$ is finite-dimensional, then any state ${\\omega}:B(H)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb C}$ takes the form\n ${\\omega}(a)={\\mbox{\\rm Tr}\\,}({\\rho} a)$ for some density operator ${\\rho}$ (i.e., ${\\rho}\\geq 0$ and ${\\mbox{\\rm Tr}\\,}({\\rho})=1$). In general, density operators define \\emph{normal} states, which by definition have the following property:  for each orthogonal family $(e_i)$ of projections on $H$ (i.e., $e_i^*=e_i$ and  $e_ie_j={\\delta}_{ij}e_i$) one has ${\\omega}\\left(\\sum_i e_i\\right)=\\sum_i{\\omega}(e_i)$; states that are not normal are called \\emph{singular}, and such states exist even if $H$ is separable, see below. \n\nNow suppose that some non-zero linear map ${\\omega}':B(H)_{\\mathrm{sa}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb R}$ is \\emph{dispersion-free}, i.e., ${\\omega}'(a^2)={\\omega}'(a)^2$; without loss of generality we may also assume that ${\\omega}'(1_H)=1$. \nThis implies that ${\\omega}'$ is positive and canonically extends to a state ${\\omega}:B(H)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb C}$. If ${\\omega}'$ is also normal (which is automatic if $H$ is finite-dimensional), then  ${\\omega}(a)={\\mbox{\\rm Tr}\\,}({\\rho} a)$, as above, from which (provided $\\dim(H)>1$)  it is easy to see that ${\\omega}$ cannot be dispersion-free on all self-adjoint operators $a$. In the eyes of von  Neumann and most of his contemporaries, this contradiction proved that {quantum mechanics}\\ did not admit underlying hidden variables (at least of a kind we now  call \\emph{non-contextual}). Belinfante (1973, p.\\ 24, p. 34) recalls that\n\\begin{quotation}\n `the authority of von Neumann's overgeneralized claim for nearly two decades stifled any progress in the search for hidden-variable theories (\\ldots) for decades nobody spoke up against von Neumann's arguments, and his conclusions were quoted by some as the gospel'. \n\\end{quotation}\nHowever, the  philosopher Hermann (1935)  already pointed out that von Neumann's linearity assumption, though valid for quantum-mechanical expectation values, was not justified\nfor dispersion-free states, if only because addition of non-commuting observables was not physically defined (a point of which von Neumann (1932) was actually well aware, since he attempted to justify such additions through the use of ensembles). \nSee also Seevinck (2012). Unaware of this---Hermann   was one of the very few women in academia at the time and also published in an obscure Neokantian journal---Bell (1966) and Kochen \\& Specker (1967) made a similar point and also remedied it, proving what we now call the Kochen--Specker Theorem (sometimes also named after Bell).\nIt is sad to note that  Bell and some of his followers later  left the realm of decent academic discourse (and displayed the depth of their own misunderstanding) by calling von Neumann's argument ``silly'' and ``foolish''.\n In  fact,  von Neumann  carefully qualifies his  result by stating that it follows\n  `\\emph{im Rahmen unserer Bedingungen}', i.e.\\ `\\emph{given our assumptions}', and \n should be credited rather than ridiculed for being the first author to impose useful constraints on {hidden variable}\\ theories, anticipating  all later literature on the subject; see also  Bub (2011).\n\n In order to explain the link of this development to (exact) Bohrification, we now go back to Gleason (1957), but in addition use later results as reviewed in Maeda (1990) and Hamhalter (2004).

In summary, the (trivial) first step is to show that\n ${\\omega}(e)\\in\\{0,1\\}$ for any projection $e$. From this, one shows that ${\\omega}$ must be multiplicative on all of $B(H)$ (Hamhalter, 1993). If ${\\omega}$ is normal, Gleason's Theorem already excludes this. If not, $H$ must be infinite-dimensional, in which case \n  there is a projection $e$ and an operator $v$ such that $e=vv^*$ and $1_H-e=v^*v$ (this is sometimes called the \\emph{halving lemma}, which is easy to prove).

Finally, although linearity on all commuting self-adjoint operators seems stronger than linearity on each $C^*(a)$, Theorem \\ref{Gleason2} shows that these conditions are in fact equivalent. \n  \n  In sum,  Gleason's Theorem and the Kochen--Specker Theorem  give results (of a positive and a negative kind, respectively) on the behaviour of state-like functionals on all of $B(H)$ \\emph{given their behaviour on commutative C*-subalgebras thereof}. This supports the idea of exact Bohrification, which suggests that access to $B(H)$ should precisely be gained through such subalgebras. We now turn to another major influence on this kind of thinking.\n\\section{The Kadison--Singer conjecture}\\label{KSC}\nA state ${\\omega}$ on some {C*-algebra}\\ $A$ is called \\emph{pure} if it has no decomposition\n${\\omega}=t{\\omega}_1+(1-t){\\omega}_2$, where $t\\in(0,1)$ and ${\\omega}_1\\neq{\\omega}_1$ are states on $A$ (note that the set of all states is convex). The pure states on $A=C_0(X)$ are given by the evaluation maps ${\\omega}_x(f)=f(x)$ and hence correspond to points $x\\in X$. For any {Hilbert space}\\ $H$, the \\emph{normal} pure states on $B(H)$ are the vector states ${\\omega}_{{\\psi}}(b)={\\langle}\\psi,b\\psi{\\rangle}$, where $\\psi\\in H$ is some unit vector.\n\nAround the same time as Gleason (1957), and similarly inspired by {quantum mechanics}\\ through the work of von Neumann (1932) and Mackey (1957), Kadison \\& Singer (1959) wrote a visionary paper on pure states on \\emph{maximal} commutative C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$. \nTheir work   arose from the  desire to clarify a potential mathematical ambiguity in the Dirac notation commonly used in {quantum mechanics}.\nNamely, if ${\\underline}{a}=(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)$ is\n a maximal set of commuting self-adjoint operators on some \\emph{finite-dimensional} {Hilbert space}\\ $H$,   \nthen $H$ has a basis of joint eigenvectors $|{\\underline}{{\\lambda}}{\\rangle}$ of ${\\underline}{a}$, which physicists typically label by the corresponding eigenvalues \n${\\underline}{{\\lambda}}=({\\lambda}_1, \\ldots, {\\lambda}_n)$. Equivalently, given a single  self-adjoint operator $a$ that is maximal in the sense that its spectrum ${\\sigma}(a)$ is nondegenerate, the eigenvectors of $a$, denoted by $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$, ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$, form a basis of $H$. The first situation reduces to the second, since $a_i=f_i(a)$ for a single $a$ and suitable functions $f_i:{\\sigma}(a)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb R}$. \n\nAlgebraically, what happens here is that each ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$ initially  defines a pure (and hence multiplicative) state ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}$ on $C^*(a)$ by  ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}(a)={\\lambda}$ and of course  ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}(1_H)=1$, which enforces\n ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}(f(a))=f({\\lambda})$ for any polynomial $f$ (this much is true also if $\\dim(H)=\\infty$, in which case the last equation holds  for any $f\\in C({\\sigma}(a))$, see also \\S\\ref{Born} below).  Since ${\\lambda}$ defines a unit eigenvector $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ that, given that $a$ is maximal, is unique up to a phase, it also defines a unique  extension ${\\omega}_{{\\lambda}}$ of ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}$  to a pure state  on  $B(H)$, namely (in Dirac notation) ${\\omega}_{{\\lambda}}(b)={\\langle}{\\lambda}|b|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$, $b\\in B(H)$. Indeed, it is this uniqueness property that\n makes the labeling $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ unambiguous in the first place. By contrast, if $a$ is not maximal  it has an  eigenvalue ${\\lambda}$ having at least two orthogonal eigenvectors, which clearly define different vector states on $B(H)$. Similarly for \n the commutative {C*-algebra}\\   $C^*({\\underline}{a})$ generated by the $a_i$;  the two examples can be united by noting that---assuming maximality---both $C^*(a)$ and $C^*({\\underline}{a})$ are unitarily equivalent to the algebra $D_n({\\mathbb C})$ of diagonal matrices on ${\\mathbb C}^n$ for  $n=\\dim(H)$ (namely by changing some given basis of $H$  to a basis of eigenvectors of  $a$ or ${\\underline}{a}$). \n  \n The same is true for any maximal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $A\\subset B(H)$, since $A=C^*(a)$ for some maximal self-adjoint $a$.\nWe may therefore summarize the discussion so far as follows: \\emph{if $H$ is finite-dimensional, then\n  any pure state on any maximal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $A\\subset B(H)$ has a unique extension to a pure state on $B(H)$, and this is what makes  the Dirac notation $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ unambiguous.} This supports the idea of exact Bohrification,  since it shows that a state on the noncommutative algebra  $B(H)$ of all observables  is already determined by its value on any maximal commutative C*-subalgebra $A\\subset B(H)$.\n \n What about infinite-dimensional {Hilbert space} s? The first difference with the finite-dimensional case is that even if $H$ is separable (which is the only case that has been studied so far, sufficient as it is for most applications), maximal commutative C*-subalgebras $A$ of $B(H)$---which are always {von Neumann algebra} s, i.e.\\ $A''=A$---are no longer unique (up to unitary equivalence). Indeed,  $A$\nis unitarily equivalent to exactly one of the following:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $L^{\\infty}(0,1)\\subset B(L^2(0,1))$;\n\\item $\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})\\subset B(\\ell^2({\\mathbb N}))$;\n\\item $L^{\\infty}(0,1)\\oplus \\ell^{\\infty}(\\kappa)\\subset B(L^2(0,1)\\oplus\\ell^2(\\kappa))$,\n\\end{enumerate}\nwhere $\\kappa$ is either $\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$, \nin which case $\\ell^2(\\kappa)\\cong{\\mathbb C}^n$ and $\\ell^{\\infty}(\\kappa)\\cong D_n({\\mathbb C})$, or ${\\kappa}={\\mathbb N}$;\nthe inclusions are given by realizing each commutative algebra by multiplication operators. This classification was stated without proof in Kadison \\& Singer (1959); the details appeared later in  Kadison \\& Ringrose (1986, \\S9.4), based on von Neumann (1931), who initiated the study of commutative {von Neumann algebra} s. See also Stevens (2015). \n\n The second difference  is that if $\\dim(H)=\\infty$, then $B(H)$ admits \\emph{singular} pure states, which cannot be represented by some unit vector in $H$; the difficulty of the state extension property in question entirely comes from the singular case. \nWe elaborate a little. If $H=L^2(0,1)$ and $a$ is the position operator, i.e., $a\\psi(x)=x\\psi(x)$, having spectrum ${\\sigma}(a)=[0,1]$, then for any ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$ there exists a (necessarily singular) pure state ${\\omega}$ on $B(H)$ such that ${\\omega}(a)={\\lambda}$. More generally, this is true whenever $a\\in B(H)_{\\mathrm{sa}}$ and ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}_c(a)$ (i.e., the continuous spectrum of $a$, defined as the complement of the set of eigenvalues in ${\\sigma}(a)$). \n\nThis apparently gives rigorous meaning to the Dirac notation $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ for improper eigenstates, though with an important caveat. In the light of the discussion above, one might rephrase the  situation as follows: the position operator $a$ generates a maximal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$ in $B(L^2(0,1))$, which admits no \\emph{normal} pure states whatsoever. However, each ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$ defines a \\emph{singular} pure state  ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}$ on $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$, which has at least one pure extension ${\\omega}_{{\\lambda}}$ to $B(L^2(0,1))$. But is this extension unique? This question also arises for \n$\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})$, although this algebra does admit normal pure states (namely ${\\omega}_k(f)=f(k)$, where $k\\in{\\mathbb N}$). However, the ``overwhelming majority'' of pure states on $\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})$ are singular (corresponding to elements of the so-called  \\v{C}ech--Stone compactification $\\beta{\\mathbb N}$ of ${\\mathbb N}$). \n\n  For separable {Hilbert space} s, the pure state extension problem has been  solved:\n  \\begin{Theorem}\\label{KSTheorem12}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Any \\emph{normal} pure state on any maximal commutative C*-subalgebra $A\\subset B(H)$ has a unique (and hence pure) extension to $B(H)$.\n\\item Any pure state on $\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})$ has a unique extension to $ B(\\ell^2({\\mathbb N}))$.\n\\item There exist (necessarily singular) pure states on $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$ that do not have a unique extension to $B(L^2(0,1))$, and similarly for $L^{\\infty}(0,1)\\oplus \\ell^{\\infty}(\\kappa)$, for any $\\kappa$. \n\\end{itemize} \n\\end{Theorem}\nWe note \nthat uniqueness of the the state extension property in question---or the lack of it---is preserved under unitary equivalence.\nThe first part of this theorem is even true for non-separable {Hilbert space} s; it may be proved along the lines of the finite-dimensional case. If one agrees that only normal states (i.e., density operators) can be realized physically---in that singular states (such as exact eigenstates of position or momentum) are idealizations---this settles the issue and supports exact Bohrification, as explained above. The singular case, however, is of much more mathematical interest and might even be physically relevant, depending on the way one thinks about idealizations (see also \\S\\ref{ideal} below).\n\n The second part of the theorem is the path-breaking solution of the \\emph{Kadison--Singer conjecture} due to Marcus, Spielman,  \\& Srivastava (2014a,b), with important earlier contributions by Weaver (2004);  see also Tao (2013) and Stevens (2015) for lucid expositions of the proof. Though less well known, the third part, due to Kadison \\& Singer themselves, whose arguments were later simplified by Anderson (1979) and  Stevens (2015), is as  remarkable than the second; it shows that Dirac's notation $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ may be ambiguous, or, equivalently, that  maximal commutative C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$ that are unitarily equivalent to $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$ (like the one generated by the position operator or the momentum operator) do not suffice to characterize pure states. What to make of this is unclear. \n  \\section{The poset ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$, topos theory, and quantum logic}\n  Returning to the story in \\S\\ref{GKS}, the next step was to collect all unital  commutative C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$, or indeed of an arbitrary unital\n   {C*-algebra}\\ $A$, into a single mathematical object ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$; with some goodwill, one might call ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ the mathematical home of complementarity (although the construction applies even when $A$ itself is commutative). This decisive idea goes back to  Isham \\& Butterfield (1998) for $A=B(H)$ and, more generally, to Hamilton, Isham, \\& Butterfield (2000) for arbitrary {von Neumann algebra} s (and hence these authors consider  von Neumann subalgebras instead of C*-subalgebras).\n   \nHeunen, Landsman \\& Spitters (2009) introduced the poset ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ whose elements are  commutative C*-subalgebras of $A$ that contain the unit $1_A$, ordered by (set-theoretic) inclusion (note that Isham et al use the opposite order, which even apart from their von Neumann algebraic setting gives the theory a totally different flavor as soon as sheaves are defined).\n  At this stage of the Bohrification program it was perhaps not  realized what a powerful object ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ already  is by itself, even though it has ``forgotten'' the commutative subalgebras (which are merely points in ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$) and just ``remembers'' their inclusion relations; this realization only came with papers like D\\\"{o}ring \\& Harding (2010),  Hamhalter (2011), Heunen (2014a),\n    Heunen \\& Lindenhovius (2015), and  Lindenhovius (2016). \n      Thus we introduced the ``tautological map'' $C\\mapsto C$, where the $C$ on the left-hand side is an element of ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ (now seen as a posetal category, in which $C$ and $D$ are connected by an arrow iff $C\\subseteq D$), whereas the $C$ on the right-hand side is $C$ itself, initially seen as a set. Seen as a functor ${\\underline}{A}$ from ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ to the category $\\mathsf{Sets}$ of sets (where the arrow $C\\rightarrow D$, i.e., $C\\subseteq D$, is mapped to the inclusion map $C\\hookrightarrow D$ of the underlying sets), \nour tautological map turns out to define a \\emph{commutative} internal {C*-algebra}\\ in the topos $[{\\mathcal{C}(A)},\\mathsf{Sets}]$\n of all functors from ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ to $\\mathsf{Sets}$. See Mac Lane \\& Moerdijk (1994) for an introduction to topos theory and Banaschewski \\& Mulvey (2006) for the general theory of commutative {C*-algebra} s and Gelfand duality in toposes: broadly speaking, a topos provides a universe---alternative to set theory---in which to do mathematics, generally based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, see below. It was this transfiguration of a (generally noncommutative) {C*-algebra}\\ $A$ into an internal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $A$, which essentially consists of all (unital) commutative C*-subalgebras of $A$ but may be treated as a single {C*-algebra}\\ (in a different topos from $\\mathsf{Sets}$),  that was initially meant by the term ``Bohrification'', which we now use much more liberally. So far, the main harvest of this construction has been:\n \\begin{itemize}\n\\item The definition (Heunen et al, 2009) and explicit computation (Heunen et al, 2012; Wolters, 2013) of the (internal) Gelfand spectrum ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$ of ${\\underline}{A}$,  playing the role of a quantum-mechanical phase space (which is lacking in the usual formalism).\n\\item The realization of states on $A$ as probability measures on  ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$  (Heunen et al, 2009).\n\\item The reformulation of the Kochen--Specker Theorem to the effect that (at least for {C*-algebra} s like $A=B(H)$ for $\\dim(H)>2$) \nthe phase space ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$ has no points (Isham \\& Butterfield, 1998; Caspers et al, 2009; Heunen et al, 2009).\n\\item Intuitionistic logic as the logic of {quantum mechanics}\\ (Caspers et al, 2009;  D\\\"{o}ring \\& Isham, 2010; \nD\\\"{o}ring 2012; Heunen et al, 2012; Hermens, 2009, 2016; Wolters, 2013).\n\\end{itemize}\nAll this requires extensive explanation, especially because these claims are meant in the sense of internal reasoning in a topos (Mac Lane \\& Moerdijk, 1994), but let us restrict ourselves to some brief comments on the last two points (see references for details).\n\n Even in the topos $\\mathsf{Sets}$, which is the home of classical mathematics (using the Zermelo--Fraenkel axioms), spaces may or may not have points, provided we interpret the notion of a ``space'' as a \\emph{frame}, which is a (necessarily distributive)\ncomplete  lattice $F$ in which $U\\wedge \\bigvee S=\\bigvee \\{U\\wedge V, V\\in S\\}$\n for arbitrary elements $U\\in F$ and subsets $S\\subset F$. Frames are motivated by the example $F={\\mathcal O}(X)$,\n i.e., the collection of open sets on some topological space $X$, where the supremum is  given by  set-theoretic union.\n To see if a given frame $F$ is of this form, one looks at the \\emph{points} of $F$, defined as frame maps $p:F\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$, where\n the frame $\\{0,1\\}\\equiv {\\mathcal O}(\\mathrm{point})$ has order $0\\leq 1$. The set $\\mathrm{Pt}(F)$ of points of $F$ is a topological space, with open sets $\\{p\\in \\mathrm{Pt}(F)\\mid p{^{-1}}(U)=1\\}$, where $U\\in F$. If $F\\cong {\\mathcal O}(\\mathrm{Pt}(F))$, we say that $F$ is \\emph{spatial}.  Even in set theory, frames are not necessarily spatial (and if they are, the axiom of choice---which is unavailable in many toposes---is often needed to prove this).\n All this can be internalized in topos theory, and the Kochen--Specker Theorem states that the Gelfand spectrum of ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$ of ${\\underline}{A}$ not merely fails to be spatial: it has no points whatsoever! Looking at points of phase space in classical physics as truth-makers (of propositions), this is no surprise: after all,  the very point (sic) of the Kochen--Specker Theorem is  that in {quantum mechanics}\\ not all propositions can have simultaneous (sharp) truth values. \n \n Frames are also closely related to \\emph{Heyting algebras}, defined as distributive lattices ${H}$ (with top $1$ and bottom $0$) equipped with a binary map $\\rightarrow:{H}{\\times}{H}\\rightarrow{H}$ (playing the role of implication in logic) that satisfies the axiom \n$U\\leq (V\\rightarrow W)$   iff  $(U{\\wedge} V)\\leq W$. In a Heyting algebra (unlike a Boolean algebra), negation is a derived\nnotion, defined by $\\neg U=U\\rightarrow\\bot$. \n Every Boolean algebra is\na Heyting algebra, but not \\emph{vice versa}; in fact, a Heyting\nalgebra is Boolean iff $\\neg\\neg U=U$ for all $U$, or, equivalently,  $(\\neg U)\\vee U=\\top$,\nwhich states the law of the excluded middle (famously denied by the Dutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer). \nThus Heyting algebras formalize intuitionistic propositional logic. \nA  Heyting algebra  $H$ is \\emph{complete} when it is complete as a lattice, in which case $H$ is a frame.\n Conversely,  a frame is a complete Heyting algebra with implication $V\\rightarrow W=\\bigvee\\{U\\mid U{\\wedge} V\\leq W\\}$. \n \nThe point, then, is that exact Bohrification implies that quantum logic is given by a particular Heyting algebra $H(A)$ eventually  defined by the given {C*-algebra}\\ $A$.  Thus quantum logic turns out to be intuitionistic: it preserves distributivity (i.e., of ``and'' over ``or'') but denies the law of the excluded middle. The simplest example is $A=M_n({\\mathbb C})$, which describes an $n$-level system, for which the relevant Heyting algebra comes down as\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": -1, "prevtext": " where ${\\rho}$ is a  density operator on $H$ uniquely determined by $P$. \n Conversely, each density operator ${\\rho}$ on $H$ defines a probability measure $P$ \non ${\\mathcal P}(H)$ via {\\eqref}{Peometrrhoe}. \nWithout CH, this is true  also for non-separable $H$ if $P$ is assumed to be completely additive. \n\\item  Each finitely additive probability measure $P$ \non ${\\mathcal P}(H)$ is induced by a  unique  state  ${\\omega}$ on $B(H)$ via\n\n", "index": 9, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nP(e)={\\omega}(e).\\label{Peometrrhoec}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E4.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"P(e)={\\omega}(e).\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi>\u03c9</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02794.tex", "nexttext": "\nwith pointwise order, i.e., $\\mathsf{e}\\leq \\mathsf{f}$ iff $\\mathsf{e}(C)\\leq \\mathsf{f}(C)$ for each $C\\in{\\mathbb C}(M_n({\\mathbb C}))$.

In particular, \n the unit function $1_{{\\sigma}(a)}:x\\mapsto 1$ maps to  the unit operator $1_{{\\sigma}(a)}(a)=1_H$, whilst \n the identity function $\\mathrm{id}_{{\\sigma}(a)}:x\\mapsto x$ is mapped to  $\\mathrm{id}_{{\\sigma}(a)}(a)=a$. See e.g.\\ Pedersen (1989), Thm.\\ 4.4.1. \n \nNow recall the Riesz--Radon representation theorem from \\S\\ref{sec1}.\nTake a unit vector $\\psi\\in H$ (or, more generally,   a state ${\\omega}$ on $B(H)$). Combining this with the spectral theorem  above, we obtain a  unique probability measure $\\mu_{\\psi}$ (or $\\mu_{{\\omega}}$)\n on the spectrum ${\\sigma}(a)$ of $a$ such that\n \n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 47753, "prevtext": " \n Conversely, each state ${\\omega}$ on $H$ defines a probability measure $P$ \non ${\\mathcal P}(H)$ via {\\eqref}{Peometrrhoec}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{Theorem}\n\\begin{Corollary} If $\\dim(H)>2$, then\n each weak quasi-state on $B(H)$  is linear and hence is actually a state.

In summary, the (trivial) first step is to show that\n ${\\omega}(e)\\in\\{0,1\\}$ for any projection $e$. From this, one shows that ${\\omega}$ must be multiplicative on all of $B(H)$ (Hamhalter, 1993). If ${\\omega}$ is normal, Gleason's Theorem already excludes this. If not, $H$ must be infinite-dimensional, in which case \n  there is a projection $e$ and an operator $v$ such that $e=vv^*$ and $1_H-e=v^*v$ (this is sometimes called the \\emph{halving lemma}, which is easy to prove).  Multiplicativity of ${\\omega}$ then implies   ${\\omega}(e)={\\omega}(1_H-e)$, which \ncontradicts the additivity property ${\\omega}(e)+{\\omega}(1_H-e)={\\omega}(1_H)=1$ obtained from Aarens (1970) cited above: indeed, \nif ${\\omega}(e)=0$ one finds $0=1$, whereas ${\\omega}(e)=1$ implies $2=1$. \n \n  To understand the connection with the original \n  Kochen--Specker Theorem, let some map ${\\omega}':B(H)_{\\mathrm{sa}}\\rightarrow{\\mathbb R}$ be dispersion-free, i.e., ${\\omega}'(a^2)={\\omega}'(a)^2$ for each \n $a\\in B(H)_{\\mathrm{sa}}$, and quasi-linear, i.e., linear on commuting operators (it was shown by Fine (1974) that these conditions are equivalent to the ones originally imposed by Kochen \\& Specker (1967), viz.\\ ${\\omega}(a)\\in{\\sigma}(a)$ and\n ${\\omega}(f(a))=f({\\omega}(a))$ for each Borel function $f:{\\sigma}(a)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb R}$).\n Canonically extending such a map ${\\omega}'$ to a map ${\\omega}:B(H)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb C}$ by complex linearity \n (cf.\\ Definition \\ref{gleasondefs2}.2 (a)) \n  and noting that\n dispersion-freeness implies positivity and hence continuity on each subalgebra $C^*(a)$, we see that \n  dispersion-freeness and quasi-linearity\n  imply that ${\\omega}$ is multiplicative on $C^*(a)$, and hence pure (conversely, pure states on $C^*(a)$ are dispersion-free). Finally, although linearity on all commuting self-adjoint operators seems stronger than linearity on each $C^*(a)$, Theorem \\ref{Gleason2} shows that these conditions are in fact equivalent. \n  \n  In sum,  Gleason's Theorem and the Kochen--Specker Theorem  give results (of a positive and a negative kind, respectively) on the behaviour of state-like functionals on all of $B(H)$ \\emph{given their behaviour on commutative C*-subalgebras thereof}. This supports the idea of exact Bohrification, which suggests that access to $B(H)$ should precisely be gained through such subalgebras. We now turn to another major influence on this kind of thinking.\n\\section{The Kadison--Singer conjecture}\\label{KSC}\nA state ${\\omega}$ on some {C*-algebra}\\ $A$ is called \\emph{pure} if it has no decomposition\n${\\omega}=t{\\omega}_1+(1-t){\\omega}_2$, where $t\\in(0,1)$ and ${\\omega}_1\\neq{\\omega}_1$ are states on $A$ (note that the set of all states is convex). The pure states on $A=C_0(X)$ are given by the evaluation maps ${\\omega}_x(f)=f(x)$ and hence correspond to points $x\\in X$. For any {Hilbert space}\\ $H$, the \\emph{normal} pure states on $B(H)$ are the vector states ${\\omega}_{{\\psi}}(b)={\\langle}\\psi,b\\psi{\\rangle}$, where $\\psi\\in H$ is some unit vector.\n\nAround the same time as Gleason (1957), and similarly inspired by {quantum mechanics}\\ through the work of von Neumann (1932) and Mackey (1957), Kadison \\& Singer (1959) wrote a visionary paper on pure states on \\emph{maximal} commutative C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$. \nTheir work   arose from the  desire to clarify a potential mathematical ambiguity in the Dirac notation commonly used in {quantum mechanics}.\nNamely, if ${\\underline}{a}=(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)$ is\n a maximal set of commuting self-adjoint operators on some \\emph{finite-dimensional} {Hilbert space}\\ $H$,   \nthen $H$ has a basis of joint eigenvectors $|{\\underline}{{\\lambda}}{\\rangle}$ of ${\\underline}{a}$, which physicists typically label by the corresponding eigenvalues \n${\\underline}{{\\lambda}}=({\\lambda}_1, \\ldots, {\\lambda}_n)$. Equivalently, given a single  self-adjoint operator $a$ that is maximal in the sense that its spectrum ${\\sigma}(a)$ is nondegenerate, the eigenvectors of $a$, denoted by $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$, ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$, form a basis of $H$. The first situation reduces to the second, since $a_i=f_i(a)$ for a single $a$ and suitable functions $f_i:{\\sigma}(a)\\rightarrow{\\mathbb R}$. \n\nAlgebraically, what happens here is that each ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$ initially  defines a pure (and hence multiplicative) state ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}$ on $C^*(a)$ by  ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}(a)={\\lambda}$ and of course  ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}(1_H)=1$, which enforces\n ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}(f(a))=f({\\lambda})$ for any polynomial $f$ (this much is true also if $\\dim(H)=\\infty$, in which case the last equation holds  for any $f\\in C({\\sigma}(a))$, see also \\S\\ref{Born} below).  Since ${\\lambda}$ defines a unit eigenvector $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ that, given that $a$ is maximal, is unique up to a phase, it also defines a unique  extension ${\\omega}_{{\\lambda}}$ of ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}$  to a pure state  on  $B(H)$, namely (in Dirac notation) ${\\omega}_{{\\lambda}}(b)={\\langle}{\\lambda}|b|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$, $b\\in B(H)$. Indeed, it is this uniqueness property that\n makes the labeling $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ unambiguous in the first place. By contrast, if $a$ is not maximal  it has an  eigenvalue ${\\lambda}$ having at least two orthogonal eigenvectors, which clearly define different vector states on $B(H)$. Similarly for \n the commutative {C*-algebra}\\   $C^*({\\underline}{a})$ generated by the $a_i$;  the two examples can be united by noting that---assuming maximality---both $C^*(a)$ and $C^*({\\underline}{a})$ are unitarily equivalent to the algebra $D_n({\\mathbb C})$ of diagonal matrices on ${\\mathbb C}^n$ for  $n=\\dim(H)$ (namely by changing some given basis of $H$  to a basis of eigenvectors of  $a$ or ${\\underline}{a}$). \n  \n The same is true for any maximal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $A\\subset B(H)$, since $A=C^*(a)$ for some maximal self-adjoint $a$.\nWe may therefore summarize the discussion so far as follows: \\emph{if $H$ is finite-dimensional, then\n  any pure state on any maximal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $A\\subset B(H)$ has a unique extension to a pure state on $B(H)$, and this is what makes  the Dirac notation $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ unambiguous.} This supports the idea of exact Bohrification,  since it shows that a state on the noncommutative algebra  $B(H)$ of all observables  is already determined by its value on any maximal commutative C*-subalgebra $A\\subset B(H)$.\n \n What about infinite-dimensional {Hilbert space} s? The first difference with the finite-dimensional case is that even if $H$ is separable (which is the only case that has been studied so far, sufficient as it is for most applications), maximal commutative C*-subalgebras $A$ of $B(H)$---which are always {von Neumann algebra} s, i.e.\\ $A''=A$---are no longer unique (up to unitary equivalence). Indeed,  $A$\nis unitarily equivalent to exactly one of the following:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $L^{\\infty}(0,1)\\subset B(L^2(0,1))$;\n\\item $\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})\\subset B(\\ell^2({\\mathbb N}))$;\n\\item $L^{\\infty}(0,1)\\oplus \\ell^{\\infty}(\\kappa)\\subset B(L^2(0,1)\\oplus\\ell^2(\\kappa))$,\n\\end{enumerate}\nwhere $\\kappa$ is either $\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$, \nin which case $\\ell^2(\\kappa)\\cong{\\mathbb C}^n$ and $\\ell^{\\infty}(\\kappa)\\cong D_n({\\mathbb C})$, or ${\\kappa}={\\mathbb N}$;\nthe inclusions are given by realizing each commutative algebra by multiplication operators. This classification was stated without proof in Kadison \\& Singer (1959); the details appeared later in  Kadison \\& Ringrose (1986, \\S9.4), based on von Neumann (1931), who initiated the study of commutative {von Neumann algebra} s. See also Stevens (2015). \n\n The second difference  is that if $\\dim(H)=\\infty$, then $B(H)$ admits \\emph{singular} pure states, which cannot be represented by some unit vector in $H$; the difficulty of the state extension property in question entirely comes from the singular case. \nWe elaborate a little. If $H=L^2(0,1)$ and $a$ is the position operator, i.e., $a\\psi(x)=x\\psi(x)$, having spectrum ${\\sigma}(a)=[0,1]$, then for any ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$ there exists a (necessarily singular) pure state ${\\omega}$ on $B(H)$ such that ${\\omega}(a)={\\lambda}$. More generally, this is true whenever $a\\in B(H)_{\\mathrm{sa}}$ and ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}_c(a)$ (i.e., the continuous spectrum of $a$, defined as the complement of the set of eigenvalues in ${\\sigma}(a)$). \n\nThis apparently gives rigorous meaning to the Dirac notation $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ for improper eigenstates, though with an important caveat. In the light of the discussion above, one might rephrase the  situation as follows: the position operator $a$ generates a maximal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$ in $B(L^2(0,1))$, which admits no \\emph{normal} pure states whatsoever. However, each ${\\lambda}\\in{\\sigma}(a)$ defines a \\emph{singular} pure state  ${\\omega}'_{{\\lambda}}$ on $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$, which has at least one pure extension ${\\omega}_{{\\lambda}}$ to $B(L^2(0,1))$. But is this extension unique? This question also arises for \n$\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})$, although this algebra does admit normal pure states (namely ${\\omega}_k(f)=f(k)$, where $k\\in{\\mathbb N}$). However, the ``overwhelming majority'' of pure states on $\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})$ are singular (corresponding to elements of the so-called  \\v{C}ech--Stone compactification $\\beta{\\mathbb N}$ of ${\\mathbb N}$). \n\n  For separable {Hilbert space} s, the pure state extension problem has been  solved:\n  \\begin{Theorem}\\label{KSTheorem12}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Any \\emph{normal} pure state on any maximal commutative C*-subalgebra $A\\subset B(H)$ has a unique (and hence pure) extension to $B(H)$.\n\\item Any pure state on $\\ell^{\\infty}({\\mathbb N})$ has a unique extension to $ B(\\ell^2({\\mathbb N}))$.\n\\item There exist (necessarily singular) pure states on $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$ that do not have a unique extension to $B(L^2(0,1))$, and similarly for $L^{\\infty}(0,1)\\oplus \\ell^{\\infty}(\\kappa)$, for any $\\kappa$. \n\\end{itemize} \n\\end{Theorem}\nWe note \nthat uniqueness of the the state extension property in question---or the lack of it---is preserved under unitary equivalence.\nThe first part of this theorem is even true for non-separable {Hilbert space} s; it may be proved along the lines of the finite-dimensional case. If one agrees that only normal states (i.e., density operators) can be realized physically---in that singular states (such as exact eigenstates of position or momentum) are idealizations---this settles the issue and supports exact Bohrification, as explained above. The singular case, however, is of much more mathematical interest and might even be physically relevant, depending on the way one thinks about idealizations (see also \\S\\ref{ideal} below).\n\n The second part of the theorem is the path-breaking solution of the \\emph{Kadison--Singer conjecture} due to Marcus, Spielman,  \\& Srivastava (2014a,b), with important earlier contributions by Weaver (2004);  see also Tao (2013) and Stevens (2015) for lucid expositions of the proof. Though less well known, the third part, due to Kadison \\& Singer themselves, whose arguments were later simplified by Anderson (1979) and  Stevens (2015), is as  remarkable than the second; it shows that Dirac's notation $|{\\lambda}{\\rangle}$ may be ambiguous, or, equivalently, that  maximal commutative C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$ that are unitarily equivalent to $L^{\\infty}(0,1)$ (like the one generated by the position operator or the momentum operator) do not suffice to characterize pure states. What to make of this is unclear. \n  \\section{The poset ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$, topos theory, and quantum logic}\n  Returning to the story in \\S\\ref{GKS}, the next step was to collect all unital  commutative C*-subalgebras of $B(H)$, or indeed of an arbitrary unital\n   {C*-algebra}\\ $A$, into a single mathematical object ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$; with some goodwill, one might call ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ the mathematical home of complementarity (although the construction applies even when $A$ itself is commutative). This decisive idea goes back to  Isham \\& Butterfield (1998) for $A=B(H)$ and, more generally, to Hamilton, Isham, \\& Butterfield (2000) for arbitrary {von Neumann algebra} s (and hence these authors consider  von Neumann subalgebras instead of C*-subalgebras).\n   \nHeunen, Landsman \\& Spitters (2009) introduced the poset ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ whose elements are  commutative C*-subalgebras of $A$ that contain the unit $1_A$, ordered by (set-theoretic) inclusion (note that Isham et al use the opposite order, which even apart from their von Neumann algebraic setting gives the theory a totally different flavor as soon as sheaves are defined).\n  At this stage of the Bohrification program it was perhaps not  realized what a powerful object ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ already  is by itself, even though it has ``forgotten'' the commutative subalgebras (which are merely points in ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$) and just ``remembers'' their inclusion relations; this realization only came with papers like D\\\"{o}ring \\& Harding (2010),  Hamhalter (2011), Heunen (2014a),\n    Heunen \\& Lindenhovius (2015), and  Lindenhovius (2016). \n      Thus we introduced the ``tautological map'' $C\\mapsto C$, where the $C$ on the left-hand side is an element of ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ (now seen as a posetal category, in which $C$ and $D$ are connected by an arrow iff $C\\subseteq D$), whereas the $C$ on the right-hand side is $C$ itself, initially seen as a set. Seen as a functor ${\\underline}{A}$ from ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ to the category $\\mathsf{Sets}$ of sets (where the arrow $C\\rightarrow D$, i.e., $C\\subseteq D$, is mapped to the inclusion map $C\\hookrightarrow D$ of the underlying sets), \nour tautological map turns out to define a \\emph{commutative} internal {C*-algebra}\\ in the topos $[{\\mathcal{C}(A)},\\mathsf{Sets}]$\n of all functors from ${\\mathcal{C}(A)}$ to $\\mathsf{Sets}$. See Mac Lane \\& Moerdijk (1994) for an introduction to topos theory and Banaschewski \\& Mulvey (2006) for the general theory of commutative {C*-algebra} s and Gelfand duality in toposes: broadly speaking, a topos provides a universe---alternative to set theory---in which to do mathematics, generally based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, see below. It was this transfiguration of a (generally noncommutative) {C*-algebra}\\ $A$ into an internal commutative {C*-algebra}\\ $A$, which essentially consists of all (unital) commutative C*-subalgebras of $A$ but may be treated as a single {C*-algebra}\\ (in a different topos from $\\mathsf{Sets}$),  that was initially meant by the term ``Bohrification'', which we now use much more liberally. So far, the main harvest of this construction has been:\n \\begin{itemize}\n\\item The definition (Heunen et al, 2009) and explicit computation (Heunen et al, 2012; Wolters, 2013) of the (internal) Gelfand spectrum ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$ of ${\\underline}{A}$,  playing the role of a quantum-mechanical phase space (which is lacking in the usual formalism).\n\\item The realization of states on $A$ as probability measures on  ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$  (Heunen et al, 2009).\n\\item The reformulation of the Kochen--Specker Theorem to the effect that (at least for {C*-algebra} s like $A=B(H)$ for $\\dim(H)>2$) \nthe phase space ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$ has no points (Isham \\& Butterfield, 1998; Caspers et al, 2009; Heunen et al, 2009).\n\\item Intuitionistic logic as the logic of {quantum mechanics}\\ (Caspers et al, 2009;  D\\\"{o}ring \\& Isham, 2010; \nD\\\"{o}ring 2012; Heunen et al, 2012; Hermens, 2009, 2016; Wolters, 2013).\n\\end{itemize}\nAll this requires extensive explanation, especially because these claims are meant in the sense of internal reasoning in a topos (Mac Lane \\& Moerdijk, 1994), but let us restrict ourselves to some brief comments on the last two points (see references for details).\n\n Even in the topos $\\mathsf{Sets}$, which is the home of classical mathematics (using the Zermelo--Fraenkel axioms), spaces may or may not have points, provided we interpret the notion of a ``space'' as a \\emph{frame}, which is a (necessarily distributive)\ncomplete  lattice $F$ in which $U\\wedge \\bigvee S=\\bigvee \\{U\\wedge V, V\\in S\\}$\n for arbitrary elements $U\\in F$ and subsets $S\\subset F$. Frames are motivated by the example $F={\\mathcal O}(X)$,\n i.e., the collection of open sets on some topological space $X$, where the supremum is  given by  set-theoretic union.\n To see if a given frame $F$ is of this form, one looks at the \\emph{points} of $F$, defined as frame maps $p:F\\rightarrow\\{0,1\\}$, where\n the frame $\\{0,1\\}\\equiv {\\mathcal O}(\\mathrm{point})$ has order $0\\leq 1$. The set $\\mathrm{Pt}(F)$ of points of $F$ is a topological space, with open sets $\\{p\\in \\mathrm{Pt}(F)\\mid p{^{-1}}(U)=1\\}$, where $U\\in F$. If $F\\cong {\\mathcal O}(\\mathrm{Pt}(F))$, we say that $F$ is \\emph{spatial}.  Even in set theory, frames are not necessarily spatial (and if they are, the axiom of choice---which is unavailable in many toposes---is often needed to prove this).\n All this can be internalized in topos theory, and the Kochen--Specker Theorem states that the Gelfand spectrum of ${\\underline}{{\\Sigma}}({\\underline}{A})$ of ${\\underline}{A}$ not merely fails to be spatial: it has no points whatsoever! Looking at points of phase space in classical physics as truth-makers (of propositions), this is no surprise: after all,  the very point (sic) of the Kochen--Specker Theorem is  that in {quantum mechanics}\\ not all propositions can have simultaneous (sharp) truth values. \n \n Frames are also closely related to \\emph{Heyting algebras}, defined as distributive lattices ${H}$ (with top $1$ and bottom $0$) equipped with a binary map $\\rightarrow:{H}{\\times}{H}\\rightarrow{H}$ (playing the role of implication in logic) that satisfies the axiom \n$U\\leq (V\\rightarrow W)$   iff  $(U{\\wedge} V)\\leq W$. In a Heyting algebra (unlike a Boolean algebra), negation is a derived\nnotion, defined by $\\neg U=U\\rightarrow\\bot$. \n Every Boolean algebra is\na Heyting algebra, but not \\emph{vice versa}; in fact, a Heyting\nalgebra is Boolean iff $\\neg\\neg U=U$ for all $U$, or, equivalently,  $(\\neg U)\\vee U=\\top$,\nwhich states the law of the excluded middle (famously denied by the Dutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer). \nThus Heyting algebras formalize intuitionistic propositional logic. \nA  Heyting algebra  $H$ is \\emph{complete} when it is complete as a lattice, in which case $H$ is a frame.\n Conversely,  a frame is a complete Heyting algebra with implication $V\\rightarrow W=\\bigvee\\{U\\mid U{\\wedge} V\\leq W\\}$. \n \nThe point, then, is that exact Bohrification implies that quantum logic is given by a particular Heyting algebra $H(A)$ eventually  defined by the given {C*-algebra}\\ $A$.  Thus quantum logic turns out to be intuitionistic: it preserves distributivity (i.e., of ``and'' over ``or'') but denies the law of the excluded middle. The simplest example is $A=M_n({\\mathbb C})$, which describes an $n$-level system, for which the relevant Heyting algebra comes down as\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{equation}\nH(M_n({\\mathbb C}))=\\{\\mathsf{e}:\\mathcal{C}(A) \\rightarrow {\\mathcal P}(A)\\mid {\\mathsf{e}}(C)\\in {\\mathcal P}(C),\\, \n{\\mathsf{e}}(C)\\leq {\\mathsf{e}}(D)\\:\\mbox{if}\\: C\\subseteq D\\}, \\label{bohr}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E5.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"H(M_{n}({\\mathbb{C}}))=\\{\\mathsf{e}:\\mathcal{C}(A)\\rightarrow{\\mathcal{P}}(A)%&#10;\\mid{\\mathsf{e}}(C)\\in{\\mathcal{P}}(C),\\,{\\mathsf{e}}(C)\\leq{\\mathsf{e}}(D)\\&gt;%&#10;\\mbox{if}\\&gt;C\\subseteq D\\},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mi>H</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>\u2102</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mi>\ud835\uddbe</mi><mo>:</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udc9e</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2192</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcab</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2223</mo><mi>\ud835\uddbe</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2208</mo><mi class=\"ltx_font_mathcaligraphic\">\ud835\udcab</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo rspace=\"4.2pt\">,</mo><mi>\ud835\uddbe</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mi>\ud835\uddbe</mi><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>D</mi><mo rspace=\"4.7pt\" stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mpadded width=\"+2.2pt\"><mtext>if</mtext></mpadded><mi>C</mi><mo>\u2286</mo><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.02794.tex", "nexttext": " for each $f\\in C({\\sigma}(a))$ (or, more generally, ${\\omega}(f(a))=\\int_{{\\sigma}(a)} d\\mu_{{\\omega}}\\, f$).

In particular, \n the unit function $1_{{\\sigma}(a)}:x\\mapsto 1$ maps to  the unit operator $1_{{\\sigma}(a)}(a)=1_H$, whilst \n the identity function $\\mathrm{id}_{{\\sigma}(a)}:x\\mapsto x$ is mapped to  $\\mathrm{id}_{{\\sigma}(a)}(a)=a$.

A classical perspective on either of those \\emph{a priori} quantum-mechanical situations only arises in the limit $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ (i.e., $1/N\\rightarrow 0$), in which  the Born probability arises as an objective property of the experiment(s).  Nothing is implied about single cases; these will be discussed in \\S\\ref{mmp} below, preceded by an intermezzo on the complications caused by the fact that in reality the limit $N=\\infty$ (or $\\hbar=0$) is never reached. This is arguably why Bohr insists that merely the \\emph{results of the observations}---as opposed to the underlying \\emph{phenomena}---must be expressed in classical terms. \n\n Our two derivations of the Born rule reflect the two ways one may look at probabilities in physics (as opposed to betting, which context is inappropriate here), namely either as relative frequencies (which corresponds to the point of view offered by asymptotic  Bohrification) or as chances for outcomes of individual random events (which is the perspective given by exact  Bohrification); the relationship between these two approaches to probability is as much in need of clarification as  the link between exact and asymptotic Bohrification!\n\\section{Intermezzo: Limits and idealizations}\\label{ideal}\nAsymptotic  Bohrification always involves some classical theory, described by a commutative {C*-algebra}\\ of observables $A_0$ (typically of the form $A_0=C_0(X)$ for some phase space $X$) and a family of quantum theories indexed by $\\hbar\\in I\\subset [0,1]$, each of which is described by some commutative {C*-algebra}\\ of observables $A_{\\hbar}$. This  includes both the case where \n$\\hbar\\in(0,1]$ and the limit of interest is $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$, and the case where\n$\\hbar=1/N$, where $N\\in{\\mathbb N}$  and the limit of interest is $N\\rightarrow\\infty$. We regard the $A_0$-theory as an idealization that never occurs in physical reality, but which  approximates the family of $A_{\\hbar}$-theories in asymptotic regimes described by the parameter $\\hbar$ (or $N$). Thus we follow Norton (2012, abstract):\n\\begin{quotation} [$A_0$ is]\n`another system whose properties provide an inexact description of the target system' [i.e., $A_{\\hbar}$].\n\\end{quotation}\nMathematically, $A_0$  is a limiting case of the theories  $A_{\\hbar}$\nas $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$ (or $N\\rightarrow\\infty$), in the sense explained in the appendix. \nExamples one may have in mind are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item  $A_0$ is either classical mechanics or thermodynamics (of an infinite system);\n\\item $A_{\\hbar}$ is either quantum mechanics or quantum statistical mechanics (for finite $N$).\n\\end{itemize}\nSee Landsman (1998) for the classical-quantum link in this language and  Landsman (2007) for thermodynamics as a limiting case of quantum statistical mechanics of finite systems.\n\n\\noindent \nThe latter also has another limit, namely quantum statistical mechanics of infinite systems, described by a different continuous bundle of {C*-algebra} s, which is of no concern here.\n\nPhysicists typically call $A_0$ a \\emph{phenomenological theory} and refer to $A_{\\hbar}$ at $\\hbar>0$ \nas a  \\emph{fundamental theory}; we sometimes write $A_{>0}$ for the latter family. \nIn the philosophy of science, $A_0$ is often referred to as a \\emph{higher-level theory} or a   \\emph{reduced theory}, in which case  $A_{>0}$   is said to be a\n \\emph{lower-level theory},  or a \\emph{reducing theory}, respectively. \n It is important to realize that $A_0$ plays double role: one the one hand, it is\n an idealization or a limiting case of the family of $A_{\\hbar}$-theories as $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$, whilst on the other \nhand it is defined and understood by itself; indeed, in our examples the $A_0$-theories historically predate the \n$A_{>0}$ theories and were once believed to be real and absolutely correct (if not holy).  Furthermore, in many interesting cases (including the ones above) $A_0$\n \\emph{taken by itself} has important features that are surprising or even seem out of the question in its role as a limiting theory. For example, \n classical mechanics and  thermodynamics both allow spontaneous symmetry breaking, which according to conventional wisdom (corrected below) is absent in any finite quantum system. Moreover, measurements in classical physics  have outcomes, whereas {quantum mechanics}\\ faces the infamous measurement problem, see \\S\\ref{mmp} below.\n \nThe fact that the phenomenological theory does not really exist in nature, as opposed to the fundamental theory that gives rise to it---or so we assume---poses a severe problem: \\emph{Real physical systems are supposed to be described by $A_{>0}$\nrather than by the idealization $A_0$, yet in nature these systems display the surprising  features claimed to be intrinsic to $A_0$ (and denied to $A_{>0}$).} For example, the reality of ferromagnetism shows that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in nature, although finite materials are supposed to be described by the $A_{>0}$-theory that allegedly forbids it. \nSimilarly,  measurements have outcomes, although the world is described by the $A_{>0}$-theory (viz.\\ {quantum mechanics}) that fails to predict this. In sum, \\emph{the $A_{>0}$-theory fails to describe key features of the real systems that should fall within its scope, whereas the $A_0$-theory  describes these features despite the fact that, being an idealization, real systems in principle do not fall within its scope. }\n\nTo resolve this paradox, we introduce two principles that, if adhered to,  should guarantee the  link between theory and reality.\n \\emph{Earman's Principle} states that:\n\\begin{quotation}\n`While idealizations are useful and, perhaps, even essential to progress in physics, a sound principle of interpretation would seem to be that no effect  can be counted as  a genuine physical effect if it disappears\nwhen the idealizations are removed.' \\hfill (Earman, 2004, p.\\ 191)\n\\end{quotation}\n \\emph{Butterfield's Principle} follows up on this, claiming what should happen instead is that:\n\\begin{quotation}\n`There is a weaker,\nyet still vivid, novel and robust behaviour  that\noccurs before we get to the limit, i.e. for finite $N$. And it is this weaker behaviour\nwhich is physically real.' \\hfill (Butterfield, 2011, p.\\ 1065)\n\\end{quotation}\nAlthough these principles should, in our view, be uncontroversial, since the link between theory and reality stands or falls with them, it is remarkable how often idealizations violate them. All rigorous theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum statistical mechanics strictly apply to infinite systems only (Bratteli \\& Robinson, 1981;  Liu \\& Emch, 2005), and similarly in quantum field theory (Haag, 1992; Ruetsche, 2011). The same is true for the `Swiss' approach to the measurement problem based on superselection rules (Hepp, 1972;  Emch \\& Whitten-Wolfe, 1976), and more recent developments thereof by\n Landsman (1991, 1995) and Sewell (2005). For a change, we here side with Bell (1975)!\n    \\section{Rethinking the measurement problem}\\label{mmp}\n To the best of our knowledge, apart from some very general comments, e.g., in his Como Lecture and in his correspondence (Zinkernagel, 2016), the only time Bohr wrote in some technical detail about  the quantum-mechanical measurement process was in his  papers with Rosenfeld on the measurability of the electromagnetic field (Bohr, 1996, pp.\\ 53--166).  However, these comments and papers predate the Cat problem raised by Schr\\\"{o}dinger (1935),  and do not seem to address what we now see as the {measurement problem}\\ of {quantum mechanics}. Indeed, \n one wonders how Bohr would respond to the amazing recent experiments like Arndt et al (2015), Hornberger et al (2012),  \n Kaltenbaek et al (2015),  Palomaki et al (2013), and  Kovachy et al (2015).\n \n Nonetheless,  Bohrification provides a clear lead on the {measurement problem}. \n Let us begin with the proper formulation of the problem, on which its  solution should evidently be predicated.\n To set the stage,  Maudlin (1995) distinguishes three {measurement problem} s:\n \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\emph{The problem of outcomes} states that the following assumptions are contradictory:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The wave-function of the system is complete;\n\\item The wave-function always evolves linearly (e.g., by the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation);\n\\item Measurements have determinate outcomes.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\item  \\emph{The problem of statistics} is that 1(a) = 2(a) and 1(b) = 2(b) also contradict:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[(c)] Measurement situations which are described by identical initial wave-functions sometimes have different outcomes, and the probability of each possible outcome is given by the Born rule.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\item  \\emph{The problem of effect} requires that any (physical or philosophical) mechanism producing measurement outcomes should also update the predictions of {quantum mechanics}\\ for subsequent measurements (typically that these have the same outcome). \n\\end{enumerate}\nFurthermore, Maudlin (1995) also gives a classification of potential solutions: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Hidden-variable theories abandon 1(a) = 2(a);\n\\item Collapse theories abandon 1(b) = 2(b)\n\\item Multiverse theories abandon 1(c) and reinterpret the word ``different'' in 2(c).\n\\end{itemize}\nAs quite rightly emphasized by Maudlin, turning superpositions  into mixtures \ndoes not even address any of these problems, which is why  decoherence (or, for that matter, superselection rules),\nthough an interesting prediction of {quantum mechanics}\\ (Joos et al, 2003; Schlosshauer, 2007) by itself fails to solve the {measurement problem}, despite occasional but persistent claims to the contrary (especially in the literature on experimental physics).  \n\nOur own take on the {measurement problem}\\ is a bit different. First, an apparent problem famously emphasized by Bell (1990) is that ``measurement''  is a \\emph{priori} undefined within {quantum mechanics}.  Hence the first part of the measurement problem is to define measurement. In our view, this part of the problem \\emph{was} solved by Bohr through his doctrine of classical concepts, which effectively says that a physical interaction \\emph{defines} a measurement as soon as the  measurement device---though ultimately quantum-mechanical in an ontological sense---is \\emph{described} or \\emph{perceived} classically. Thus the doctrine of classical concepts is an epistemological  move (Scheibe, 1973; Camilleri \\& Schlosshauer, 2015). \n\nWithout such an interpretation of measurement (which places it outside {quantum mechanics}), there is no {measurement problem}\\ in the first place, since there are no outcomes.  \nTo Bohr, his definition of measurement through the doctrine of classical concepts seems to have been the end of it, but to us, it is just the beginning!  Recalling (from \\S\\ref{ideal}) that the $A_0$-theory in which measurement outcomes are defined is a limit of the $A_{>0}$-theory responsible for these outcomes, it should be the case that the limits of the underlying (pure) quantum states of the measurement device as $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$ (or $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, either of which limit would enforce a classical description) are pure states on $A_0$, since facts in classical physics correspond to pure (i.e., dispersion-free) states, at least approximately. But this is not at all what {quantum mechanics}\\ predicts!  In typical Schr\\\"{o}dinger Cat situations the limits in question are \\emph{mixed} states that are not even approximately pure (Landsman \\& Reuvers, 2013; Landsman, 2013). But in reality  sharp outcomes always occur, and so we obtain a violation of  Butterfield's Principle: outcomes (mathematically represented by pure states in $A_0$), are not foreshadowed in $A_{>0}$ (whose superpositions induce mixtures in the limit), although at the same time $A_0$  should arise from $A_{>0}$ as a limit theory. \n\nWith Butterfield's Principle, the link between theory and reality falls.

This  includes both the case where \n$\\hbar\\in(0,1]$ and the limit of interest is $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$, and the case where\n$\\hbar=1/N$, where $N\\in{\\mathbb N}$  and the limit of interest is $N\\rightarrow\\infty$. We regard the $A_0$-theory as an idealization that never occurs in physical reality, but which  approximates the family of $A_{\\hbar}$-theories in asymptotic regimes described by the parameter $\\hbar$ (or $N$). Thus we follow Norton (2012, abstract):\n\\begin{quotation} [$A_0$ is]\n`another system whose properties provide an inexact description of the target system' [i.e., $A_{\\hbar}$].\n\\end{quotation}\nMathematically, $A_0$  is a limiting case of the theories  $A_{\\hbar}$\nas $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$ (or $N\\rightarrow\\infty$), in the sense explained in the appendix. \nExamples one may have in mind are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item  $A_0$ is either classical mechanics or thermodynamics (of an infinite system);\n\\item $A_{\\hbar}$ is either quantum mechanics or quantum statistical mechanics (for finite $N$).\n\\end{itemize}\nSee Landsman (1998) for the classical-quantum link in this language and  Landsman (2007) for thermodynamics as a limiting case of quantum statistical mechanics of finite systems.\n\n\\noindent \nThe latter also has another limit, namely quantum statistical mechanics of infinite systems, described by a different continuous bundle of {C*-algebra} s, which is of no concern here.\n\nPhysicists typically call $A_0$ a \\emph{phenomenological theory} and refer to $A_{\\hbar}$ at $\\hbar>0$ \nas a  \\emph{fundamental theory}; we sometimes write $A_{>0}$ for the latter family. \nIn the philosophy of science, $A_0$ is often referred to as a \\emph{higher-level theory} or a   \\emph{reduced theory}, in which case  $A_{>0}$   is said to be a\n \\emph{lower-level theory},  or a \\emph{reducing theory}, respectively. \n It is important to realize that $A_0$ plays double role: one the one hand, it is\n an idealization or a limiting case of the family of $A_{\\hbar}$-theories as $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$, whilst on the other \nhand it is defined and understood by itself; indeed, in our examples the $A_0$-theories historically predate the \n$A_{>0}$ theories and were once believed to be real and absolutely correct (if not holy).  Furthermore, in many interesting cases (including the ones above) $A_0$\n \\emph{taken by itself} has important features that are surprising or even seem out of the question in its role as a limiting theory. For example, \n classical mechanics and  thermodynamics both allow spontaneous symmetry breaking, which according to conventional wisdom (corrected below) is absent in any finite quantum system. Moreover, measurements in classical physics  have outcomes, whereas {quantum mechanics}\\ faces the infamous measurement problem, see \\S\\ref{mmp} below.\n \nThe fact that the phenomenological theory does not really exist in nature, as opposed to the fundamental theory that gives rise to it---or so we assume---poses a severe problem: \\emph{Real physical systems are supposed to be described by $A_{>0}$\nrather than by the idealization $A_0$, yet in nature these systems display the surprising  features claimed to be intrinsic to $A_0$ (and denied to $A_{>0}$).} For example, the reality of ferromagnetism shows that spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in nature, although finite materials are supposed to be described by the $A_{>0}$-theory that allegedly forbids it. \nSimilarly,  measurements have outcomes, although the world is described by the $A_{>0}$-theory (viz.\\ {quantum mechanics}) that fails to predict this. In sum, \\emph{the $A_{>0}$-theory fails to describe key features of the real systems that should fall within its scope, whereas the $A_0$-theory  describes these features despite the fact that, being an idealization, real systems in principle do not fall within its scope. }\n\nTo resolve this paradox, we introduce two principles that, if adhered to,  should guarantee the  link between theory and reality.\n \\emph{Earman's Principle} states that:\n\\begin{quotation}\n`While idealizations are useful and, perhaps, even essential to progress in physics, a sound principle of interpretation would seem to be that no effect  can be counted as  a genuine physical effect if it disappears\nwhen the idealizations are removed.' \\hfill (Earman, 2004, p.\\ 191)\n\\end{quotation}\n \\emph{Butterfield's Principle} follows up on this, claiming what should happen instead is that:\n\\begin{quotation}\n`There is a weaker,\nyet still vivid, novel and robust behaviour  that\noccurs before we get to the limit, i.e. for finite $N$. And it is this weaker behaviour\nwhich is physically real.' \\hfill (Butterfield, 2011, p.\\ 1065)\n\\end{quotation}\nAlthough these principles should, in our view, be uncontroversial, since the link between theory and reality stands or falls with them, it is remarkable how often idealizations violate them. All rigorous theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum statistical mechanics strictly apply to infinite systems only (Bratteli \\& Robinson, 1981;  Liu \\& Emch, 2005), and similarly in quantum field theory (Haag, 1992; Ruetsche, 2011). The same is true for the `Swiss' approach to the measurement problem based on superselection rules (Hepp, 1972;  Emch \\& Whitten-Wolfe, 1976), and more recent developments thereof by\n Landsman (1991, 1995) and Sewell (2005). For a change, we here side with Bell (1975)!\n    \\section{Rethinking the measurement problem}\\label{mmp}\n To the best of our knowledge, apart from some very general comments, e.g., in his Como Lecture and in his correspondence (Zinkernagel, 2016), the only time Bohr wrote in some technical detail about  the quantum-mechanical measurement process was in his  papers with Rosenfeld on the measurability of the electromagnetic field (Bohr, 1996, pp.\\ 53--166).  However, these comments and papers predate the Cat problem raised by Schr\\\"{o}dinger (1935),  and do not seem to address what we now see as the {measurement problem}\\ of {quantum mechanics}. Indeed, \n one wonders how Bohr would respond to the amazing recent experiments like Arndt et al (2015), Hornberger et al (2012),  \n Kaltenbaek et al (2015),  Palomaki et al (2013), and  Kovachy et al (2015).\n \n Nonetheless,  Bohrification provides a clear lead on the {measurement problem}. \n Let us begin with the proper formulation of the problem, on which its  solution should evidently be predicated.\n To set the stage,  Maudlin (1995) distinguishes three {measurement problem} s:\n \\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\emph{The problem of outcomes} states that the following assumptions are contradictory:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The wave-function of the system is complete;\n\\item The wave-function always evolves linearly (e.g., by the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation);\n\\item Measurements have determinate outcomes.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\item  \\emph{The problem of statistics} is that 1(a) = 2(a) and 1(b) = 2(b) also contradict:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[(c)] Measurement situations which are described by identical initial wave-functions sometimes have different outcomes, and the probability of each possible outcome is given by the Born rule.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\\item  \\emph{The problem of effect} requires that any (physical or philosophical) mechanism producing measurement outcomes should also update the predictions of {quantum mechanics}\\ for subsequent measurements (typically that these have the same outcome). \n\\end{enumerate}\nFurthermore, Maudlin (1995) also gives a classification of potential solutions: \n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Hidden-variable theories abandon 1(a) = 2(a);\n\\item Collapse theories abandon 1(b) = 2(b)\n\\item Multiverse theories abandon 1(c) and reinterpret the word ``different'' in 2(c).\n\\end{itemize}\nAs quite rightly emphasized by Maudlin, turning superpositions  into mixtures \ndoes not even address any of these problems, which is why  decoherence (or, for that matter, superselection rules),\nthough an interesting prediction of {quantum mechanics}\\ (Joos et al, 2003; Schlosshauer, 2007) by itself fails to solve the {measurement problem}, despite occasional but persistent claims to the contrary (especially in the literature on experimental physics).  \n\nOur own take on the {measurement problem}\\ is a bit different. First, an apparent problem famously emphasized by Bell (1990) is that ``measurement''  is a \\emph{priori} undefined within {quantum mechanics}.  Hence the first part of the measurement problem is to define measurement. In our view, this part of the problem \\emph{was} solved by Bohr through his doctrine of classical concepts, which effectively says that a physical interaction \\emph{defines} a measurement as soon as the  measurement device---though ultimately quantum-mechanical in an ontological sense---is \\emph{described} or \\emph{perceived} classically. Thus the doctrine of classical concepts is an epistemological  move (Scheibe, 1973; Camilleri \\& Schlosshauer, 2015). \n\nWithout such an interpretation of measurement (which places it outside {quantum mechanics}), there is no {measurement problem}\\ in the first place, since there are no outcomes.  \nTo Bohr, his definition of measurement through the doctrine of classical concepts seems to have been the end of it, but to us, it is just the beginning!  Recalling (from \\S\\ref{ideal}) that the $A_0$-theory in which measurement outcomes are defined is a limit of the $A_{>0}$-theory responsible for these outcomes, it should be the case that the limits of the underlying (pure) quantum states of the measurement device as $\\hbar\\rightarrow 0$ (or $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, either of which limit would enforce a classical description) are pure states on $A_0$, since facts in classical physics correspond to pure (i.e., dispersion-free) states, at least approximately. But this is not at all what {quantum mechanics}\\ predicts!  In typical Schr\\\"{o}dinger Cat situations the limits in question are \\emph{mixed} states that are not even approximately pure (Landsman \\& Reuvers, 2013; Landsman, 2013). But in reality  sharp outcomes always occur, and so we obtain a violation of  Butterfield's Principle: outcomes (mathematically represented by pure states in $A_0$), are not foreshadowed in $A_{>0}$ (whose superpositions induce mixtures in the limit), although at the same time $A_0$  should arise from $A_{>0}$ as a limit theory. \n\nWith Butterfield's Principle, the link between theory and reality falls. In other words, it is by no means enough that (in Schr\\\"{o}dinger Cat situations) a classical description of the measurement device turns pure quantum superpositions into mixtures (which is trivially the case in the limit): \n all terms but one eventually have to \\emph{disappear} from the state. According to Butterfield's Principle\nthis disappearance must (approximately) take place already in {quantum mechanics}\\ (if only in the limiting regime); a \\emph{Deus ex Machina} that suddenly turns classical mixtures into classical pure states (like the ignorance interpretation of classical probability) but did not previously act on the underlying quantum theory  violates   Earman's Principle, since in reality the classical limit is never reached; cf.\\ \\S\\ref{ideal}. \n\nTo see the mathematics of asymptotic Bohrification in a simple model of  measurement, consider the continuous bundle of {C*-algebra} s over $I=[0,1]$ that has fibers\n \\begin{eqnarray}\nA_0&=& C_0({\\mathbb R}^2);\\label{A1}\\\\\nA_{\\hbar}&=& B_0(L^2({\\mathbb R}))\\:\\: (\\hbar>0), \\label{A2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nand whose continuous cross-sections are defined as follows.

Since in general the function \n  ${\\hbar}\\mapsto  \\|{\\varphi}_{\\hbar}(a)\\|_{\\hbar}$  is merely upper semicontinuous, one only obtains a structure  equivalent to the one described in the above definition if one explicitly requires the above function to be in $C(I)$, in which case \n  property 2 follows, too.
