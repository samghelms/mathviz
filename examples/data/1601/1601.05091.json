In such systems the transfer of mass takes place via Roche lobe overflow and the consequent formation of an accretion disc around the compact object. LMXBs usually have orbital periods varying from minutes to days, depending on the nature of the companion star. In particular, it exists a class of tight LMXBs, called ultra compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), that are characterised by orbital periods $<$ 80 min, and usually harbour white dwarfs or hydrogen-poor stars as companions.\n\nLMXBs can be both transient or persistent. The former group alternate short (weeks--months) and sudden periods of outburst, characterised by a typical X-ray luminosity of $ 10^{36}-10^{38} \\, \\rm erg/s $, during which the compact object accretes at high rates, to long lasting (years to decades) periods of quiescence, when the X-ray luminosity drops up to seven orders of magnitude. \n\n\\begin{table*}[htb]\n\\caption{Complete log and results of the NTT observations performed on Feb. 8, 2015.

Assuming the Eddington luminosity as an upper limit, they limited its distance to 5.8 kpc. Since then, the source remained in quiescence until Jan. 22, 2015, when the \\textit{Swift}/BAT detected a new outburst \\citep{Krimm2015a}. This outburst was characterised by a slow rise without the detection of Type I bursts. A MAXI/GSC X-ray spectrum on Jan. 26-28, 2015 showed a hard spectrum, that can be modelled by a power--law with index $ 1.68 \\pm 0.27 $ \\citep{Negoro2015}. Since the detection of the outburst, the source was regularly monitored by \\textit{Swift}. In particular, \\citet{Krimm2015b} reported an increase in brightness in the hard X-ray band (15-50 keV) after the first 20 days of activity, that then plateaued at an average rate of $ \\sim 100 $ mCrab. \n\n\nRadio observations obtained with the VLA, together with contemporaneous \\textit{Swift} X-ray observations showed that the position of the source in the radio/X-ray luminosity plane was consistent with that of hard-state neutron star LMXBs \\citep{Deller2015}. While the source was in its hard state, radio emission consistent with jets were also detected in the radio band (\\citealt{Deller2015}; \\citealt{Degenaar2015}).\n\nAround Apr. 3, 2015, a significant drop in the hard X-ray flux was detected, together with an increase in the softer X-rays (2-10 keV), suggesting that the source transitioned to a soft X-ray spectral state \\citep{Degenaar2015}. \n\n\\section{Observation and data analysis}\n\n\\subsection{Optical spectroscopy}\nJ180408 was observed on Apr. 20, 2015 with the 2.1 m telescope at the San Pedro M\\'{a}rtir Observatory (M\\'{e}xico), equipped with the Boller \\& Chivens spectrograph. Three 1,800 s spectra with a resolution of $ \\sim 6.5\\, \\AA $ (350 $\\rm km\\, \\rm s^{-1} $) were acquired, covering the wavelength range 4000--7800 \\AA. The three spectra were combined and averaged to obtain one final spectrum, in order to increase the signal to noise (S/N) ratio. \n\nData reduction was carried out using standard procedures for both bias subtraction and flat-field correction using IRAF\\footnote{http://iraf.noao.edu/}. The wavelength calibration was done using neon-helium-copper-argon lamps. The flux calibration was performed against the catalogued spectroscopic standard star Feige 67 \\citep{Massey1988}.\n\n\\subsection{NTT photometry}\nThe LMXB J180408 was observed at the La Silla observatory with the New Technology Telescope (NTT) on Feb. 8, 2015 using the instrument EFOSC2 equipped with the optical Bessel $BVR$ and Gunn $i$ filters ($ 4400\\AA -7930 \\AA $). \nA total of $8\\times15\\,\\rm s$ images for each filter was obtained in each band. A log of the observations is reported in Tab. \\ref{NTT_log}.\n\nBias and flat field corrections have been applied using the standard procedures (subtraction of an average bias frame and division by a normalised average flat field). Due to the crowdedness of the field, all the magnitudes were extracted performing point spread function (PSF) photometry with the ESO MIDAS\\footnote{http://www.eso.org/sci/software/esomidas//} {\\tt daophot} task \\citep{Stetson1987}. \nThe night was clear, with seeing $ \\sim 0.7-0.8'' $ for the whole duration of the observation. We performed differential photometry with respect to a selection of fourteen isolated stars in the field.\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[htb]\n\\caption{Complete log and results of the \\textit{Swift/UVOT} observations taken on Feb. 26, 2015.

We performed differential photometry with respect to a selection of the same six bright and isolated stars of the field in order to correct for any instrumental effect.\nThe target is well detected in the $gri$ filters, but not in the $z$-band, that was excluded from the analysis. \n\nThe calibration of the optical photometry (NTT and REM) was performed through the comparison between the fluxes measured for a group of isolated stars in the fields, chosen as reference, with the fluxes tabulated in the APASS\\footnote{http://www.aavso.org/download-apass-data} catalogue (Sec. \\ref{REM_red}). For the NTT observations, in order to pass from the $gri$ magnitudes (i.e. the SDSS filters used in the APASS catalogue) to the $BVR$ magnitudes (Johnson filters, used in EFOSC2) the corrections reported in \\cite{Jordi2006} were applied.\n\n\\subsection{\\textit{Swift/UVOT} observations}\\label{sec_UVOT}\nAfter the onset of the outburst, the system J180408 has been extensively observed both in the X-rays and UV frequencies by the \\textit{Swift} satellite. In particular, we analysed the UVOT data from the observations that started on 2015 Feb. 26, 2015, because this was contemporaneous to the first set of REM observations. A complete log of the UVOT observations is reported in Tab. \\ref{tab_log_UVOT}.\n\nThe analysis of the data was performed using the HEASOFT routine \\textit{uvotsource} that, once the extraction region (a circle centred on the source, with a radius of 4 arcsec) and the background (a circle with radius of 9.5 arcsec) are defined.\n\n\n\\subsection{Optical polarimetry with NTT}\nJ180408 was observed on 2015 Feb. 9, 2015 with the optical polarimeter of EFOSC2, mounted on the NTT, equipped with the $ BVRi $ filters. The night was clear (seeing $ \\sim 0.7'' $ during the whole duration of the observation). Image reduction was carried out by bias-subtraction and division by a normalised flat-field. A complete log of the observation is presented in Tab. \\ref{log_pol}.\nAll the flux measurements have been performed using the technique of PSF photometry (as explained in Sec. \\ref{NTT_obs}). \n\n\n\nA Wollaston prism was inserted in the optical path, so that incident radiation was simultaneously split into two different beams with orthogonal polarisation (ordinary and extraordinary beams, $o$- and $e$- beams). Furthermore, a Wollaston mask prevented the possible overlap of the different images.\nThe instrument made use of a rotating half wave plate (HWP) in order to take images at four different angles with respect to the telescope axis ($ \\Phi_{i} = 22.5^{\\circ}(i-1)$, $i=0,1,2,3$). One image of 15 s integration was obtained for each HWP angle for the $ BVRi $ filters. \n\n\\section{Results}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{spectrum_J180408_inset_new.png}\n\\caption{Averaged, flux-calibrated spectrum of J180408 obtained at the San Pedro M\\'{a}rtir Observatory (Mexico) on Apr. 20, 2015 (MJD 57132).

Absorption features due to the Galactic sodium doublet \nat 5890 \\AA\\, and to the MgIb band at 5175 \\AA \\, were detected.\nThe spectrum does not show prominent emission lines at variance with LMXBs in outburst.

This seems to suggest that a certain quantity of Helium may be present in the accretion disc of the system. \nFor this possible emission line we derived an equivalent width (EW) of $ 1.5\\pm 0.2 \\AA $ and a systemic velocity of $19.2 \\pm 96.1 \\,\\,\\rm km/s$.\n\n\\subsection{NIR/Optical/UV photometry}\n\n\\subsubsection{NTT optical observations}\\label{NTT_obs}\nThe results of the NTT $BVRi$ photometry performed on Feb. 8, 2015 (MJD 57061) are reported in Tab. \\ref{NTT_log}.   \nThe optical counterpart of J180408 is well detected in each image (Bessel $ BVR $ and Gunn $ i $).

In this case to fill the Roche lobe the orbital period should be short and these LMXBs belong to the UCXBs class.\n\\citet{Nelemans2004} analysed the spectra of three UCXBs (4U 0614+091, 4U 1543-624, and 2S 0918-549). In none of them hydrogen and He I emission lines were detected, as for J180408. The case of 4U 0614+091 was particularly intriguing since its spectrum shows prominent emission lines that could not be connected to hydrogen and helium lines. Instead, they were consistently identified with carbon and oxygen lines, leading to the conclusion that the companion star was a carbon-oxygen (CO) WD. Similar conclusions were also deducted for the other UCXBs reported in \\citet{Nelemans2004}.\n\nAs described in Sec. \\ref{sec_spectrum}, the spectrum of J180408 is rather featureless, except for the possible detection of a weak He II 4686$\\AA$ line, suggesting that helium is present in the accretion disc of the system. However, the total absence of H and He I lines is unusual and reminiscent of the behaviour of UCXBs. We thus compared the spectrum of 4U 0614+091 with that of J180408 aiming at identifying possible carbon and oxygen emission lines in the spectrum of our target. \nDespite the moderate S/N of the spectrum (Fig. \\ref{spectrum}), no clear evidence for C/O lines can be derived. Just the hints of two possible emission lines corresponding to the ones listed in \\cite{Nelemans2004} and \\cite{Baglio_4U0614_2014} are found: the C II 4650 \\AA \\, and the C III 5810 \\AA \\, lines.\nThe C II 4650 \\AA \\, line may be confused with the so-called Bowen blend, that is usually observed in LMXBs due to a fluorescence \nmechanism driven by helium that principally results in the emission of NIII 4634/4640 \\AA \\, and CIII 4647/4650 \\AA \\, lines from the \nstrongly irradiated face of the companion star. \nA possible feature consistent with the Bowen blend is present in our spectrum or even a P-Cygni profile for the weak He II 4686$\\AA$\\, line, \nbut we consider them of too low S/N to led us to firm conclusions.\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to assess whether a LMXB is a UCXB is to measure its orbital period.\n\nTo this aim we analysed the optical light curves that we obtained with \n\nREM both in February 2015 (covering $ \\sim 3.4 $ hours; Fig. \\ref{fig_REM_feb}) and April 2015 (covering $ \\sim 0.7 $ hours; Fig. \\ref{lc_REM_apr}), but no evidence for a periodicity was found, only erratic variability.\n\nThis erratic variability is typical of LMXBs during outburst, and it hampers photometric studies, especially for UCXBs (\\citealt{Nelemans2004}; \\citealt{Baglio_4U0614_2014}).\n\nWe thus tried to constrain the orbital period of the system in an alternative way. Starting from the hypothesis of the ultra-compact nature of J180408, we evaluated its mass accretion rate $ \\dot{M} $. To do this, we considered the {\\it MAXI} and the {\\it RXTE} light curves in the 2--10 and 2--20 keV band (respectively) and we integrated the counts of J180408 over the duration of the 2015 outburst. Since no other significant outburst\noccurred\nsince the first detection of the system, we averaged our luminosity over the total time of the {\\it MAXI} (first) and the {\\it RXTE+MAXI} monitoring, obtaining $ \\dot{M}= 4.0\\times10^{-11} \\, M_\\odot/\\rm yr$ and $ \\dot{M}= 1.2\\times10^{-11} \\, M_\\odot/\\rm yr$, respectively (a Crab-like spectrum has been assumed for this conversion). We also point out that the short X-ray burst that took place in 2012 \\citep{Chenevez2012} produces only a minimal change to the estimate of the mean accretion rate above. \nThe transient behaviour in LMXBs is usually explained in terms of accretion disc instabilities (DIM model, \\citealt{Lasota2008}). In order to exhibit outbursts a LMXB should have a mean mass accretion rate below a critical rate. For a He donor star (and orbital periods lower than 60 min) \nthis implies a loose limit on the mass accretion rate to be below ${\\lower.5ex\\hbox{{$\\; \\buildrel < \\over \\sim \\;$}}} 10^{-10} \\, M_\\odot/\\rm yr$ \\citep{Lasota2008}.\nIn addition, if we consider the evolutionary track of a He donor in a UCXB to match the mass accretion rate we worked out for J180408,\nwe can derive an estimate for the orbital period. Based on the tracks presented in \\cite{Lasota2008} (their Fig. 3), we can infer \nan orbital period around 40 min for J180408. This is clearly an indirect inference and should receive an observational confirmation.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{fit_sed.png}\n\\caption{NIR-Optical-UV spectral energy distributions of J180408 relative to the two epochs of Feb. 26, 2015 (MJD 57079) and Apr. 24, 2015 ({MJD 57136}).

This allowed us to build a nearly simultaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) from the NIR to the UV wavelengths.\nThe REM optical (NIR) fluxes were obtained starting from the AB (Vega) magnitudes reported in Tab. \\ref{obs_log}, corrected for the reddening due to the Galactic extinction in the direction of the target ($E(B - V)$=0.41, $A_{V}/E(B-V)=3.1$; \\citealt{Schlafly2011}).\n\n\n\nThe UV and optical fluxes relative to the \\textit{Swift}/UVOT observations were evaluated from the magnitudes of the target returned by HEASOFT (as described in Sec.\\ref{sec_UVOT}) and reported in Tab. \\ref{tab_log_UVOT}, after correcting for the interstellar absorption.\n\n\nThe same analysis has been applied to the second epoch of observations (Apr. 24, 2015 - MJD 57136), for which we possess the REM infrared and optical photometry (Sec. \\ref{REM_sec}). In the $ K $- and $ H $-bands the target was too faint to be detected and \\textit{Swift} did not observe the system on that occasion.\n\n\nThe NIR-optical-UV spectral energy distributions of the two different epochs are represented in Fig. \\ref{SED_feb}. \n\nA rigid shift ($ 1.33\\, \\rm mJy $, that corresponds to a factor of $\\sim 2$) has been applied to all the REM fluxes of the Feb. 26 epoch in order to be consistent with those of UVOT at the same wavelengths. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe focused first on the Feb. 26 epoch and we looked at the highest frequency points ($V$ filter onward) in Fig. \\ref{SED_feb} (blue dots).  \nA fit with an accretion disc model (irradiated or not) does not provide an adequate description of the data. \n\nA fit with a black body model provides instead an acceptable fit ($\\chi^2/\\rm dof=1.3$, $30\\%$ null hypothesis probability) \nwith a surface temperature of $\\sim 14,200 \\, K$ (dashed line in Fig. \\ref{SED_feb}). \n\n\nThis black body emission may come from the hot spot in the stream-disc collision region, the companion star or the outer disc regions. \n\n\nThe extrapolation of the black body spectrum largely misses the observations at lower frequency ($ r $, $ i $, $ J $, $ K $-bands).\nThis allowed us to hypothesise that the emission process dominating the red part of the SED is different from the one responsible for the blue part of the SED. The flat low-frequency spectrum is highly suggestive of a particle jet emitted from the central regions of the system. \n\nDue to the small frequency coverage of the second epoch SED (Apr. 24, 2015, the green squares in Fig. \\ref{SED_feb}),\nit was not possible to let the fit with a black body converge to reasonable values, since the peak of the black body was  unconstrained. \nHowever, the Apr. 24 SED seems to follow quite well the same black body as the Feb.  26 (the dashed line in Fig. \\ref{SED_feb}). \nThis indicates that the putative jet is a transient feature in the SED of J180408.\n\n\n\nThe presence of jets in LMXBs is usually associated with a hard X--ray spectrum. In the radio band steady jets observed to date \nduring the hard X--ray states have a flat spectrum (e.g. \\citealt{Fender01}). Above certain frequencies this flat spectral component should break to an optically thin spectrum. There are evidences both from black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries that this break occurs usually in the NIR (\\citealt{Migliari10}; \\citealt{Gandhi11}).\nDuring its outburst J180408 was monitored by several all-sky instruments, allowing us to trace its spectral evolution (see Fig. \\ref{Xray_monitoring}). As often happens in LMXB outbursts, J180408 started as a hard X--ray source and remained in the so-called hard state for about two months.\nThis is testified by the detection of J180408 with the \\textit{Swift}/BAT hard X-ray telescope and the weak detection with the \\textit{MAXI} low-energy monitoring instrument (see e.g. \\citealt{Negoro2015} and Fig. \\ref{Xray_monitoring}). On Apr. 3, 2015 (MJD 57115) a drop in the hard X-rays was observed \\citep{Degenaar2015}, suggesting that the source transitioned to a soft X-ray spectral state (Fig. \\ref{Xray_monitoring}). Consistently, the \n{\\it MAXI} flux raised considerably.  \n\nOur first SED has been taken in the hard X-ray state. As described above this SED shows a flat low-frequency tail, suggestive of a jet. \nThe contribution of the jet seems to be not just restricted to the NIR spectrum, but appears to be important at least until the $ r $-band frequency is reached. The second SED has been taken when J180408 was in the soft X-ray state where a steady jet is expected to be quenched, thus explaining the different shapes of the two SEDs (e.g. \\citealt{Russell2011}, \\citealt{Munoz2014}).\n\nIn this scenario, the non-detection of linear polarisation when the source was in the hard X-ray state (Sec. \\ref{Opt_pola}) seems to be puzzling.\nIn fact we would expect to detect some polarised emission at least at a few percent level in the optical-NIR bands \\citep{Russell11}, \nif a jet were to be present. Our polarisation data were collected on Feb. 9 some weeks before our likely detection of a jet (Feb. 26). \nEven if we cannot build a wide band SED, our NTT data collected on Feb. 8 ($BVRi$) are consistent with the low-frequency tail of a black body, as in the case of the second epoch observations with REM, when the jet was not detectable in the SED.\nWe also note that at the time of the polarisation observations, the plateau that corresponds to the hard X-ray spectral state phase of the source (namely when the jet should first arise) was not yet completely reached (and the optical flux was a factor of $\\sim 2$ lower). \nWe can thus infer that the jet was probably not yet formed at the time of our polarimetric observations or, at least, it might not contribute \nsubstantially at optical ($BVRi$) frequencies.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Xray_lc_mod2.png}\n\\caption{From top to bottom, the monitoring of the system J180408 with the BAT instrument mounted on \\textit{Swift} (15-50 keV), the {\\it MAXI} camera (2-4 keV) and with UVOT ($ v $-band) during its outburst, starting from MJD 57048 (Jan. 26, 2015). The time of the detection of the radio jet \\citep{Deller2015} and the time of the switch to a soft X-ray spectral state are highlighted with two solid lines (blue and red, respectively). With a dotted and a dashed lines the two epochs of our REM observations (Feb. 26 - Apr. 24, 2015) are marked. With two dot-dashed lines we finally indicated the times of the NTT photometric and polarimetric observations (Feb. 7-8, 2015).}\n\\label{Xray_monitoring}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Conclusions}\nIn this work we performed a detailed NIR/optical and UV study of the LMXB 1RXS J180408.9-342058. Our principal results are summarised below.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We observed the optical spectrum during outburst with the aim of identifying the nature of its companion star. The spectrum is rather featureless, with no H$\\alpha$ and HeI emission lines. This is uncommon for bright LMXBs.\nWe only  marginally detected the He II 4684\\AA\\ emission line, suggesting the presence of helium. The lack of hydrogen lead us \nto hypothesise that the companion star could be a He white dwarf and J180408 be part of the UCXB class.\n\\item We searched our photometric data for an orbital period. No evidence for a periodicity was found. Integrating \nthe long term X-ray light curve from all-sky monitoring instruments, we evaluated the mean mass accretion rate of the system. \nBased on the disc instability model \\citep{Lasota2008} and the evolutionary track for a He white dwarf companion,  \nwe estimated the orbital period of J180408 to be $\\sim 40$ min, that is typical of a UCXB. This inference clearly needs to be verified observationally.\n\\item We built the quasi-simultaneous SED from NIR to UV during the hard X-ray state. We interpret the SED as due to the emission of two components: a black body, and a steady jet that emits synchrotron radiation up to the $R$ band.\nWe also built the NIR/optical SED after the transition to a soft X-ray spectral state. As expected, during this epoch the jet seems to be quenched, leaving the black body contribution alone in the SED. \n\\item We did not observe significant polarisation in the optical bands, despite J180408 being in the hard X-ray state. \nHowever, at the time of our polarimetric observation (weeks before our likely detection of the jet in the SED), the hard X-ray state was not  completely reached by the source. We conclude that at that time the jet probably was not yet formed, or it might contribute just at lower frequencies (i.e. the radio band).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{acknowledgements}\nWe thank S.
