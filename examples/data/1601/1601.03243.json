By sampling the solution space of {\\it E. coli}'s metabolic network, we show that empirical growth rate distributions recently obtained in experiments at single-cell resolution can be explained in terms of a trade-off between the higher fitness of fast-growing phenotypes and the higher entropy of slow-growing ones. Based on this, we propose a minimal model for the evolution of a large bacterial population that captures this trade-off. The scaling relationships observed in experiments encode, in such frameworks,  for the same distance from the maximum achievable growth rate, the same degree of growth rate maximization, and/or the same rate of phenotypic change. Being grounded on genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions, these results allow for multiple implications and extensions in spite of the underlying conceptual simplicity.  \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nVirtually all intracellular processes, from metabolic reactions to gene expression, are subject to noise \\cite{maheshri2007living}. Besides enabling complex phenomena like the coordinated expression of genes across large regulons \\cite{stewart2012cellular} or the enaction of differentiation, stress response and adaptation strategies \\cite{suel2007tunability}, noise is an inescapable source of phenotypic heterogeneity even in isogenic populations grown in the same environment \\cite{rosenfeld2005gene,raj2008nature,raj2010variability,ackermann2015functional}. Quite remarkably, it has been known since the 1950's that a well-defined `average behaviour' can nevertheless  emerge, allowing to connect physiology and regulation by quantitative and reproducible  relationships at the population level \\cite{monon2012growth,schaechter1958dependency,scott2011bacterial,hui2015quantitative,shahrezaei2015connecting}. The ongoing analysis of cell-to-cell variability, on the other hand, is shedding light on the structure and magnitude of biological noise at the phenotypic level \\cite{gregor2007probing,dubuis2013positional,kiviet2014stochasticity,kellogg2015noise,avraham2015pathogen}. In particular, recent single-cell studies have quantified physiological growth-rate fluctuations across exponentially growing bacterial colonies in a variety of environments \\cite{wang2010robust, ullman2013high, kennard2014individuality,iyer2014scaling}. Growth rate  distributions measured for different E. coli strains generically appear to be unimodal, with a well-defined mean and extended to remarkably fast rates. In addition, cross-correlations between doubling times and elongation rates have been detected, along with signatures of universality and weak dependence of results on cellular strains and/or growth media \\cite{kennard2014individuality,iyer2014scaling,taheri2015cell}. These observations have allowed to settle long-standing cell biology issues like the mechanism behind cell size homeostasis in bacteria \\cite{jun2015cell}. The origin of growth rate fluctuations, however, and specifically their relation to the underlying regulatory and metabolic activities of individual cells, is less clear.\n\nTheoretical attempts at explaining observations have so far largely abstracted from the details of the biochemical and regulatory machinery of cells and focused on identifying general mechanisms behind cell-to-cell variability. Each of the key ingredients of available models --from the autocatalytic drive of cell growth \\cite{iyer2014scaling,iyer2014universality}, to the coupling between growth and expression \\cite{kiviet2014stochasticity}, to the need for an optimal scheduling of noisy cellular tasks \\cite{pugatch2015greedy}-- likely captures relevant components of stochasticity in cell growth and division. Our proposal is simpler from a theory perspective but, being grounded on current biochemical knowledge (specifically, on genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions), allows in principle to directly connect empirical growth rate distributions  to their underlying regulatory scenarios. \n\nIn essence, our argument is  based on the fact that the space of  feasible non-equilibrium steady states of E. coli's metabolic network, which can be computed from the network's stoichiometry via constraint-based modeling, provides a map of the growth phenotypes that are in principle accessible to a population of non-interacting bacteria in a given environment.  A natural question to ask, then, is whether observed growth rate  distributions can be recovered  from specific, physically and/or biologically significant samplings of the phenotypic space. Following this route, we show that empirical data are reproduced by assuming an optimal (Maximum Entropy) trade-off between fast- and slow-growing phenotypes. We then introduce a minimal model for the evolution of a bacterial population in phenotypic space that generates this picture at stationarity, leading to a further characterization of the empirical scaling of growth rate distributions. Finally, we discuss the advantages, implications, potential applications, possible extensions and (several) limitations of our approach.\n\n\n\\section{Growth rate fluctuations in the space of metabolic phenotypes}\n\n\nThe standard {\\it in silico} route to modeling cellular metabolic activity in a given medium relies on constraint-based models \\cite{orth2010flux,lewis2012constraining,mccloskey2013basic,bordbar2014constraint,palsson2015systems}. In short, assuming that the intracellular reaction network that processes nutrients (e.g. glucose) to harvest free energy and synthetize macromolecular building blocks (e.g. amino acids) operates at a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS), feasible reaction flux vectors $\\mathbf{v}=\\{v_r\\}$ ($r=1,\\ldots,N$ indexing reactions) must satisfy the mass-balance conditions \n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\\label{eq3}\n\\mathbf{S \\cdot v}=\\mathbf{0}~~,\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\mathbf{S\\cdot v}=\\mathbf{0}~{}~{},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mi>\ud835\udc12</mi><mo>\u22c5</mo><mi>\ud835\udc2f</mi></mrow><mo>=</mo><mpadded width=\"+6.6pt\"><mn/></mpadded></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.03243.tex", "nexttext": " \nwhere $a>0$ and $b>0$ are constants, while $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is the maximum growth rate allowed by the constraints that define $\\mathcal{P}$, which can be computed by linear programming as in the standard implementation of Flux-Balance-Analysis for growth maximizing microbial systems \\cite{orth2010flux}.

On the other hand, the fitting exponents $a$ and $b$ turn out to be medium-independent, thereby providing a robust characterization of the phenotypic space. Specifically, we find $a\\simeq 171$ and $b\\simeq 3.6$ for E. coli iJR904\\footnote{Note that more recent reconstructions are available (see e.g. \\cite{feist2007genome,orth2011comprehensive}), where parts of the network, like exchange fluxes with the medium, are characterized in greater detail.

These differences however can account, at least qualitatively, for part of the discrepancies one sees between the MaxEnt and population-based distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\n\nMany recently developed techniques provide access to the growth physiology of a bacterial population at single cell resolution, allowing to enrich the picture underlied by average `growth laws' \\cite{scott2011bacterial} by characterizing fluctuations in some key observables. In this work we have addressed the origin of empirical growth rate distributions in E. coli, with the aim of connecting them to the underlying cellular activity by `minimal' physically significant assumptions. Adopting the standard constraint-based modeling framework for cell metabolism, and employing an efficient method to sample the solution space of E. coli's iJR904 metabolic network reconstruction, we have applied statistical physics reasoning to obtain the following results.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item The bare growth rate distribution obtained through a flat sampling of the solution space is dominated by slow growing phenotypes, i.e. with doubling times much larger than the smallest compatible with constraints.\n\\item MaxEnt distributions at fixed mean growth rates, corresponding to a minimal ``static'' assumption on the way in which a population of non-interacting bacteria organizes in the phenotypic space, are capable of reproducing empirical data for different bacterial strains and environments by tuning two parameters, namely the maximum achievable growth rate $\\lambda_{\\max}$ and the `inverse temperature' $\\beta$ that fixes the mean growth rate. Empirical data can thus be seen as an optimal trade-off between the few, dynamically favored fast growing phenotypes and the many, entropically favored slow growing ones.\n\\item This trade-off can be captured within a minimal dynamical  model, leading to a qualitatively similar scenario in which the role of a novel parameter (the rate of phenotypic change) is highlighted. In the light of both the static and the dynamical view, we have offered a novel interpretation of the scaling properties found in empirical distributions.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe approach described here presents in our view two merits. The first one lies in its simplicity: both of the views we discuss are capable of reproducing at least the empirical evidence on growth rate distributions from minimal assumptions. In addition, being fully rooted in available network reconstructions, they allow in principle to associate growth rate distributions to (hopefully) specific states of a cell's metabolism, since cells must actively repress inefficient metabolic pathways in order to drive the population toward faster growing phenotypes. Given the complexity of the underlying biochemical machinery, it is somewhat striking that the MaxEnt rule appears by itself to be able to account for such mechanisms. Previous models, which mainly aim at isolating key general features from the complicated growth physiology, certainly capture important aspects of the problem that our approaches are  unable to bring to light. On the flipside, though, they don't allow for an immediate connection with known regulatory and/or biochemical elements.\n\nEven without going into biochemical details (work along these lines is in progress), these results present two straightforward insights of potential relevance for biology. The first is shown in the ``phase structure'' of Fig. \\ref{due}C. With our choices for the units, if one could view metabolism as a ``binary network'' in which reactions can be either on or off, the $x$-axis would roughly indicate the number of variables (fluxes) that need to be constrained in order to achieve the desired entropy reduction and mean growth rate. The fact that, in the continuous flux model of cellular metabolism, $I$ can exceed the dimension of the phenotypic space suggests that simple regulatory strategies that either silence or activate reactions in order to achieve a certain objective are unlikely to suffice: a finer degree of flux regulation is required. For a second insight, we notice that the values of $\\lambda_{\\max}$ obtained by fitting empirical data represent {\\it bona fide} predictions for the maximum growth rates achievable by a {\\it single} E. coli bacterium (as opposed to the mean growth rates of a population of cells) in different media. To our knowledge, no other method of analysis provides a similar information.\n\nAmong the main limitations of our approach is the fact that, by  relying on a fixed phenotypic space, we are implicitly not accounting for cell-cell interactions and cell-to-cell fluctuations in nutrient availability. In this sense, we are  considering a low density bacterial population in a well mixed growth medium. Secondly, the dynamical model predicts trivial mother-daughter correlations, at odds with observations that suggests a much richer picture (see e.g. \\cite{ullman2013high}, Supporting Material). That framework should therefore be seen as a zero-order description of the actual population dynamics, and will therefore need to be substantially enriched in order to get closer to biological reality (and, possibly, closer to the MaxEnt scenario). \n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nWe are indebted with P Cicuta, M Cosentino Lagomarsino and M Osella for sharing data and for very useful comments and criticism.
