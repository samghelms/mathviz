Both of these approximations must break down when the material loses rigidity, such as in foams and emulsions at their (un)jamming point -- suggesting that the window of  linear elastic response near jamming is exceedingly narrow. Yet precisely when and how this breakdown occurs remains unclear. To answer these questions, we perform computer simulations of stress relaxation and shear startup experiments in athermal soft sphere packings, the canonical model for jamming. By systematically varying the strain amplitude, strain rate, distance to jamming, and system size, we identify characteristic strain and time scales that quantify how and when the window of linear elasticity closes, and relate these scales to changes in the microscopic contact network. Our findings indicate that the mechanical response of jammed solids are generically nonlinear and rate-dependent on experimentally accessible strain and time scales. \n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\n\nLinear elasticity predicts that when an isotropic solid is sheared, the resulting stress $\\sigma$ is directly proportional to the strain $\\gamma$ and independent of the strain rate $\\dot \\gamma$,\n\n", "index": 1, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\sigma = G_0 \\gamma  \\,,\n\\label{eqn:linear}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E1.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\sigma=G_{0}\\gamma\\,,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><msub><mi>G</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>\u03b3</mi></mpadded></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.00068.tex", "nexttext": "\nThe prefactor $k$ is the contact stiffness, which generally depends on the overlap\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 8927, "prevtext": "\nwith a constant shear modulus $G_0$ \\cite{landau}.

To clarify this point, the inset of Fig.~\\ref{fig:softening} plots the strain where $\\sigma/G_0 \\gamma$ has decayed by an amount $\\Delta$ from its plateau value, denoted $\\gamma^\\dag(\\Delta)$.

We now seek to relate softening with contact changes on the particle scale \\cite{schreck11,vandeen14,knowlton14,keim14,keim15,kawasaki15}. Specifically, we identify a correlation between the softening strain $\\gamma^\\dag$, the cumulative number of contact changes, and the distance to the isostatic contact number $z_c$. In so doing we will answer the question first posed by Schreck and co-workers \\cite{schreck11}, who asked how many contact changes a packing can accumulate while still displaying linear elastic response.\n\nWe begin by investigating the ensemble-averaged contact change density $n_{\\rm cc}(\\gamma) \\equiv [N_{\\rm make}(\\gamma) + N_{\\rm break}(\\gamma)]/N$, where $N_{\\rm make}$  and $N_{\\rm break}$ are the number of made and broken contacts, respectively, accumulated during a strain $\\gamma$. Contact changes are identified by comparing the contact network at strain $\\gamma$ to the network at zero strain. \n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}a we plot $n_{\\rm cc}$ for packings of harmonic particles at pressure $p = 10^{-4}$ and varying system size. The data collapse to a single curve, indicating that $n_{\\rm cc}$ is indeed an intensive quantity.\nThe effect of varying pressure is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}b.  There are two qualitatively distinct regimes in $n_{\\rm cc}$, with a crossover governed by pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand these features, we seek to collapse the $n_{\\rm cc}$ data  to a master curve.  \nBy plotting ${\\cal N} \\equiv n_{\\rm cc}/p^{\\tau}$ versus $y \\equiv \\gamma/p$, we obtain excellent collapse for $\\tau = 1/2$, as  shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}b for the same pressures as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}a and system sizes $N = 128 \\ldots 1024$. The scaling function ${\\cal N} \\sim y$ for small $y$, while ${\\cal N} \\sim y^\\tau$ for $y \\gtrsim 1$. The rescaled strain $y$ provides further evidence for a crossover scale $\\gamma^\\dag \\sim p/k$, now apparent at the microscale. Moreover, the fact that data for varying system sizes all collapse to the same master curve is an important indicator that $\\gamma^\\dag$ is an intensive strain scale that remains finite in the large system size limit.\n\nThe scaling collapse in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}c generalizes the results of Van Deen et al.~\\cite{vandeen14}, who determined the strain scale $\\gamma_{\\rm cc}^{(1)} \\sim (p/k)^{1/2}/N$ associated with the first contact change. To see this, note that  the inverse slope $({\\rm d}\\gamma/{\\rm d}n_{\\rm cc})/N$ represents the average strain interval between contact changes at a given strain. Hence the initial slope of $n_{\\rm cc}$ is fixed by $\\gamma_{\\rm cc}^{(1)}$:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 32193, "prevtext": " \nTo implement flow start-up in MD, at time $t =0$ a packing's particles and simulation cell are instantaneously assigned an affine velocity profile $\\vec v_i = (\\dot \\gamma_0 \\, y_i,0)^T$ in accordance with a simple shear with strain rate $\\dot \\gamma_0$; the Lees-Edwards images of the simulation cell are assigned a commensurate velocity.

We now seek to relate softening with contact changes on the particle scale \\cite{schreck11,vandeen14,knowlton14,keim14,keim15,kawasaki15}. Specifically, we identify a correlation between the softening strain $\\gamma^\\dag$, the cumulative number of contact changes, and the distance to the isostatic contact number $z_c$. In so doing we will answer the question first posed by Schreck and co-workers \\cite{schreck11}, who asked how many contact changes a packing can accumulate while still displaying linear elastic response.\n\nWe begin by investigating the ensemble-averaged contact change density $n_{\\rm cc}(\\gamma) \\equiv [N_{\\rm make}(\\gamma) + N_{\\rm break}(\\gamma)]/N$, where $N_{\\rm make}$  and $N_{\\rm break}$ are the number of made and broken contacts, respectively, accumulated during a strain $\\gamma$. Contact changes are identified by comparing the contact network at strain $\\gamma$ to the network at zero strain. \n\n\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}a we plot $n_{\\rm cc}$ for packings of harmonic particles at pressure $p = 10^{-4}$ and varying system size. The data collapse to a single curve, indicating that $n_{\\rm cc}$ is indeed an intensive quantity.\nThe effect of varying pressure is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}b.  There are two qualitatively distinct regimes in $n_{\\rm cc}$, with a crossover governed by pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand these features, we seek to collapse the $n_{\\rm cc}$ data  to a master curve.  \nBy plotting ${\\cal N} \\equiv n_{\\rm cc}/p^{\\tau}$ versus $y \\equiv \\gamma/p$, we obtain excellent collapse for $\\tau = 1/2$, as  shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}b for the same pressures as in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}a and system sizes $N = 128 \\ldots 1024$. The scaling function ${\\cal N} \\sim y$ for small $y$, while ${\\cal N} \\sim y^\\tau$ for $y \\gtrsim 1$. The rescaled strain $y$ provides further evidence for a crossover scale $\\gamma^\\dag \\sim p/k$, now apparent at the microscale. Moreover, the fact that data for varying system sizes all collapse to the same master curve is an important indicator that $\\gamma^\\dag$ is an intensive strain scale that remains finite in the large system size limit.\n\nThe scaling collapse in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ncc}c generalizes the results of Van Deen et al.~\\cite{vandeen14}, who determined the strain scale $\\gamma_{\\rm cc}^{(1)} \\sim (p/k)^{1/2}/N$ associated with the first contact change. To see this, note that  the inverse slope $({\\rm d}\\gamma/{\\rm d}n_{\\rm cc})/N$ represents the average strain interval between contact changes at a given strain.

There is, however, a narrow linear elastic window that survives the accumulation of an extensive number of contact changes. This window is bounded from below by rate-dependent viscoelasticity and bounded from above by the onset of strain softening. Close to the transition these two bounds collide and the linear elastic window closes. Finally, weakly jammed materials are generally rate-dependent and/or strain softening on scales relevant to the laboratory, because the strains and strain rates bounding the linear elastic window vanish rapidly near jamming.\nFig.~\\ref{fig:regimes} provides a qualitative summary of our results. \n\nWhile our simulations are in two dimensions, we expect the scaling relations we have identified to hold for $D>2$. To the best of our knowledge, all scaling exponents near jamming that have been measured in both 2D and 3D are the same. There is also numerical evidence that $D = 2$ is the transition's upper critical dimension \\cite{goodrich12,goodrich14}.\n\nOur work provides a bridge between linear elasticity near jamming, viscoelasticity at finite strain rate, and nonlinearity at finite strain amplitude. The measured relaxation modulus $G_r$ is in good agreement with the linear viscoelasticity predicted by Tighe \\cite{tighe11}. Consistent with the granular experiments of Coulais et al., we identify a crossover to nonlinear strain softening. Their crossover scales differently with the distance to jamming, possibly due to the presence of static friction. The emulsions of Knowlton et al.~also soften \\cite{knowlton14}. They display a crossover strain that is roughly linear in $\\Delta \\phi$, consistent with both our $\\gamma^\\dag$ and the results of Otsuki and Hayakawa \\cite{otsuki14}, who simulated large amplitude oscillatory shear at finite frequency. \nThe agreement between the crossover strains in our quasistatic simulations and the oscillatory shear simulations of Ref.~\\cite{otsuki14} is surprising, as most of their results are for frequencies higher than $\\dot \\gamma^\\dag$, where viscous stresses dominate.\nThere are also qualitative differences between the quasistatic shear modulus, which cannot be collapsed to a master curve (Fig.~\\ref{fig:softening}), and the storage modulus in oscillatory shear, which can \\cite{otsuki14,dagois-bohy14}. We speculate that there are corresponding microstructural differences between packings in steady state and transient shear \\cite{regev13}, similar to those which produce memory effects \\cite{keim13}.\n\n\nSoft sphere packings near jamming approach the isostatic state, which also governs the rigidity of closely related materials such as biopolymer and fiber networks \\cite{heussinger06,heussinger06b,broedersz11,das12}. It is therefore remarkable to note that, whereas sphere packings soften under strain, quasistatically sheared amorphous networks are strain stiffening beyond a crossover strain that scales as $\\Delta z$ \\cite{wyart08}, which vanishes more slowly than $\\gamma^\\dag \\sim \\Delta z^2$ in packings. Hence nonlinearity sets in later and with opposite effect in networks \\cite{tighe14}. We expect that this difference is attributable to contact changes, which are absent or controlled by slow binding/unbinding processes in networks. \n\nWe have demonstrated that the onset of softening occurs when the system has accumulated a finite number of contact changes correlated with the system's initial distance from the isostatic state. This establishes an important link between microscopic and bulk response. Yet further work investigating the relationship between microscopic irreversibility, softening, and yielding is needed. The inter-cycle diffusivity in oscillatory shear, for example, jumps at yielding \\cite{knowlton14,kawasaki15}, but its pressure dependence has not been studied. Shear reversal tests could also provide insight into the connection between jamming and plasticity.\n\nWhile the onset of softening can be probed with quasistatic simulation methods, rate dependent effects such as the strain scale $\\gamma^*$ should be sensitive to the manner in which energy is dissipated. The dissipative contact forces considered here are most appropriate as a model for  foams and emulsions. Hence useful extensions to the present work might consider systems with, e.g., lubrication forces or a thermostat.\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\nWe thank P.~Boukany, D.~J.~Koeze, M.~van Hecke, and S.~Vasudevan for valuable discussions.\nJB, DV and BPT were supported by the Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).
