However, there has recently been much discussion about uncertainties in the significance of the peak seen by the ATLAS experiment. In this note, we aim to estimate this significance using a range of possible parametrisations for the smooth diphoton background. We obtain a local significance close to that reported by ATLAS and further demonstrate that the significance of the excess is not substantially reduced when more complicated background functions are considered. In particular, the background contribution is strongly constrained by the small numbers of events at large diphoton invariant mass. Future data releases will improve constraints on the diphoton background, as well as clarifying the true nature of the 750 GeV excess.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nIn the first results from Run-II of the LHC, both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations reported an excess above the expected background in the diphoton channel \\cite{ATLAS1, CMS1} at a diphoton invariant mass of ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}} \\sim 750 \\text{ GeV}$. The local significance of this excess was reported as $3.9\\sigma$ ($2.3\\sigma$ global) by ATLAS and $2.6\\sigma$ ($1.2\\sigma$ global) by CMS. The possibility that this excess could be due to a new bosonic particle has caused a great deal of excitement in the particle physics community and the list of papers exploring the implications for New Physics is of course too long to mention.\n\nSince the announcement of these results \\cite{Run2Seminar}, a number of authors have performed fits to the Run-II diphoton data from a theory perspective in order to estimate the mass, width and cross section times branching ratio of a possible new particle (see e.g.~Ref.~\\cite{Falkowski:2015swt}). However, these analyses typically assume a fixed form for the diphoton background whose parameters are not included in the fits. This procedure is not strictly correct, as parameter values extracted from the data should take into account uncertainties in the background. A full likelihood analysis of both the ATLAS and CMS binned diphoton data was performed in Ref.~\\cite{Buckley:2016mbr}, assuming the same background models used by the respective collaborations. The local significances reported therein are in broad agreement with those reported by ATLAS and CMS.\n\nHowever, a recent paper by Davis et al.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw} explored the possibility of allowing more freedom in the modelling of the ATLAS continuum diphoton background. Their conclusion was that the background could be fit by a number of different functional forms and that some of these forms lead to a lower significance for the diphoton excess than that reported by ATLAS, perhaps as low as $2.0\\sigma$. Motivated by this discrepancy between the results of the ATLAS collaboration and those of Davis et al., we perform an independent analysis of the binned ATLAS diphoton invariant mass spectrum to estimate the significance of the excess under different background assumptions. In particular, we perform a Poissonian likelihood fit over 40 bins in the diphoton invariant mass ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$, making this analysis distinct from that of Davis et al. The code used to perform this analysis is publicly available online \\cite{Website}.\n\nThe intention of this note is not to improve upon the ATLAS analysis or to report definitive values for the significance of the 750 GeV excess. Indeed, this is not possible with the information which is publicly available. Instead, we aim to explore the robustness of the excess to variations in background fitting, as well as to clarify certain aspects of the fits performed by ATLAS. \n\nThe different functional forms we consider for the diphoton background are given in Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}, while the local significances we obtain for the 750 GeV diphoton excess (using each functional form) are given in Table~\\ref{tab:significance}. We describe in detail the fitting procedure used in this work in Sec.~\\ref{sec:fitting}, followed by the results of background-only and signal + background fits in Sec.~\\ref{sec:BG-only} and Sec.~\\ref{sec:Sig+BG}. Finally, in Sec.~\\ref{sec:Discussion} we discuss the implications of these results for the significance of the 750 GeV excess.\n\n\n\\section{Fitting procedure}\n\\label{sec:fitting}\n\nWithin a frequentist framework, the significance of a possible excess in the diphoton spectrum can be estimated by calculating the maximum likelihood obtained assuming that only backgrounds contribute to the observed events (background-only) and that obtained assuming that both signal and background have a contribution to the observed event rate (signal + background). By comparing the maximum likelihood obtained under these two assumptions, we can then calculate the significance of a possible signal in the data.\n\nThe likelihood $\\mathcal{L}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is simply the probability of obtaining the observed data assuming a particular set of parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.

We note that the error bars on the data points are for illustrative purposes and denote the $1\\sigma$ confidence intervals on the mean number of expected events in each bin given the number of observed events.\n\n\nAs pointed out by Davis et al.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw}, the $k = 0$ fixed-normalisation background curve (dashed red) appears to underestimate the background above ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}} > 1000 \\text{ GeV}$. When adding an additional parameter to the background function, either using $k = 0$ with free normalisation (solid red) or $k = 1$ with fixed normalisation (dashed blue), the fits tend to prefer a higher background at high mass in order to alleviate this possible tension. The background contribution is also increased in the region of the 750 GeV excess, suggesting that the significance of the peak will be reduced when including these additional parameters. \n\nWe note that both the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$ background and the $k = 1$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$ background appear to match closely the background-only fit reported in Fig.~1 of Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1}. The ATLAS collaboration state that they use the $k = 0$ background function in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1} and we therefore assume that they also fit the normalisation $\\mathcal{N}$ of the background, in order to match the results shown here in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BG-only}. It therefore appears then that the background curve used by ATLAS fits the data well, apart from in the region of the 750 GeV excess and above ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}} \\sim 1600 \\text{ GeV}$ (where ATLAS report an excess with $2.8\\sigma$ local significance). \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{BG-only.pdf}\n\\caption{Background-only fits to the ATLAS diphoton invariant mass spectrum.

In Fig.~\\ref{fig:Sig+BG}, we show the maximum likelihood fits to the data for the signal + background hypothesis using the free-width analysis for the possible new resonance near 750 GeV. As before, we include fits for $k = 0, 1$ (see Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}) using both free and fixed normalisation, with the colour scheme matching that of Fig.~\\ref{fig:BG-only}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{Sig+BG.pdf}\n\\caption{Signal + background fits to the ATLAS diphoton invariant mass spectrum, allowing the width of the resonance near 750 GeV to vary freely.

As in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BG-only}, we do not show the fits for $k = 2$, as these lie close to the $k = 1$, free normalisation curve (solid blue).}\n\\label{fig:Sig+BG}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAdding a new resonance near 750 GeV clearly allows the data to be better fit with all background parametrisations. As in the background-only fits, the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$  and $k =1$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$ backgrounds produce similar results. In all cases, the expected rate at high ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ is reduced compared with the background-only fits. With the 750 GeV excess saturated by the signal contribution, the background above 1000 GeV can be reduced to better fit the large number of empty bins.\n\nIn Table~\\ref{tab:significance}, we report the maximum local significance of the ATLAS 750 GeV excess obtained in this work, using each of the functional forms introduced in Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}. For reference, the significances reported by ATLAS in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1} are $3.6\\sigma$ (NWA) and $3.9\\sigma$ (free-width). The significances obtained in this work, using the same background function used by ATLAS, are $3.4\\sigma$ (NWA) and $3.6\\sigma$ (free-width). We discuss in Sec.~\\ref{sec:Discussion} the possible sources of this small discrepancy.\n\nFor the simplest background function ($k = 0$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$) the significance of the excess is significantly larger.\\footnote{We note that we find an even larger significance using this background than that reported by Davis et al.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw}, though given the different statistical approaches, this is perhaps not surprising.} However, in Sec.~\\ref{sec:BG-only}, we found (in agreement with ATLAS) that this simple function fits the background significantly worse than the more complex ones. The remaining background parametrisations lead to very similar significances compared with the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$ function. Thus, the significance of the excess appears to be robust against the choice of background.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\\centering\n\\label{tab:significance}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{\\hskip 4\\tabcolsep}l@{\\hskip 4\\tabcolsep}l@{}}\n\\toprule\n\\toprule\nBackground function\t\t& NWA & Free-width \\\\\n\\hline \\hline\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Fixed normalisation}\\\\\n$\\qquad k = 0$\t\t\t\t& $4.2\\sigma$\t&  $4.9\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 1$\t\t\t\t& $3.4\\sigma$\t& $3.7\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 2$\t\t\t\t& $3.4\\sigma$    & $3.7\\sigma$ \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Free normalisation}\\\\\n$\\qquad k = 0^\\dagger$\t\t\t\t& $3.4\\sigma$\t&   $3.6\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 1$\t\t\t\t& $3.5\\sigma$\t&   $3.8\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 2$\t\t         & $3.4\\sigma$    & $3.6\\sigma$ \\\\\n\\hline\nATLAS reported & $3.6\\sigma$ & $3.9\\sigma$\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Estimated local significance of the ATLAS 750 GeV diphoton excess obtained in this work using each of the background functions described in Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}, assuming a freely varying resonance width (free-width) and under the narrow width approximation (NWA).

For comparison, we also give the local significance reported by the ATLAS collaboration.}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:Discussion}\n\nAs initially pointed out by Davis et al.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw}, the significance of the 750 GeV diphoton excess reported by ATLAS is higher when the background is fit with the $k = 0$, fixed-normalisation parametrisation and is reduced when an extra parameter is added to the background fit. However, this appears to be consistent with the results reported by ATLAS. Assuming that the overall normalisation of the $k=0$ background is also included in the fit, we recover the background-only fit presented in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1} and obtain significances close to (but slightly smaller than) those reported by the ATLAS collaboration.\n\nWe also note that the data show no preference for an increase in complexity of the background function (as demonstrated by the Bayesian Information Criterion study in Table~\\ref{tab:BIC}). Furthermore, we find that adding additional parameters to the background fit does not have any impact on the significance of the excess. This is because of a number of bins above ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}} \\sim 1100 \\text{ GeV}$ which see no events. Any smooth background is constrained not to overshoot these bins. \n\nDavis et al.~introduce a different possible parametrisation for the background (which was also validated by a Monte Carlo study) and find that the significance of the excess is further reduced with respect to the $k = 1$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$ case. However, the empty bins at high ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ were not included in that analysis, leading to a background fit which overestimates the high ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ event rate. Indeed, using the Davis et al.~background parametrisation (with free normalisation) in this analysis gives a local significance of $3.8\\sigma$ for a free-width resonance. This does not discount the possibility that exploring a wider range of possible background functions may impact the significance of the 750 GeV excess, but the correct constraints from the entire range of ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ should be taken into account.\n\nIt is of course necessary to point out that the significances we report are only estimates and care must be taken when comparing with the official ATLAS analysis. In particular, the results reported by ATLAS use the full unbinned data set, while we consider here only binned data. Furthermore, this data was obtained by digitising the results released in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1}. However, we have investigated the possible impact of digitisation error on our analysis. In order to do this, we added random noise to the first 10 bins in ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ (distributed uniformly between $- 3\\%$ and $+3\\%$ of the number of events in each bin) in order to simulate digitisation errors.\\footnote{At larger values of ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ the small number of events means that integer numbers of events can accurately be read off the figure. However at small values of ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ digitisation error could induce variations of order 10-100 events.} Ten such `randomised' datasets were generated and the peak significance for each was calculated assuming the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$ background. The resulting local significances were in the range:\n\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 17071, "prevtext": "\nwhere $f(q_0)$ is the probability density function of $q_0$ under the background-only hypothesis. According to Wilks' Theorem \\cite{Wilks1938}, the log-likelihood ratio (appearing in the top line of Eq.~\\ref{eq:q0}) is asymptotically $\\chi_m^2$ distributed if the background-only hypothesis is correct. The number of degrees of freedom $m$ is given by the difference between the number of parameters in the background-only and the signal + background hypotheses. For a fixed value of $m_B$ (and $\\alpha$), there is only one free parameter (the number of signal events $N_S$) so we have $m = 1$.  As detailed in Ref.~\\cite{Cowan:2010js}, in this case $q_0$ follows a `half chi-square' distribution and the local signal significance is simply given by $Z = \\sqrt{q_{0, \\mathrm{obs}}}$. The maximum value of the local significance can then be obtained by maximising over $m_B$ (or $m_B$ and $\\alpha$ in the free-width analysis).\n\n\n\\section{Background-only fits}\n\\label{sec:BG-only}\n\nWe begin by examining in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BG-only} the fits to the ATLAS data (black points) which are obtained when no signal contribution is included. We show the best fit (maximum likelihood) background curves for $k = 0$ (red) and $k = 1$ (blue), both using a free normalisation $\\mathcal{N}$ (solid lines) and when setting $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ (dashed lines). We note that the error bars on the data points are for illustrative purposes and denote the $1\\sigma$ confidence intervals on the mean number of expected events in each bin given the number of observed events.\n\n\nAs pointed out by Davis et al.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw}, the $k = 0$ fixed-normalisation background curve (dashed red) appears to underestimate the background above ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}} > 1000 \\text{ GeV}$. When adding an additional parameter to the background function, either using $k = 0$ with free normalisation (solid red) or $k = 1$ with fixed normalisation (dashed blue), the fits tend to prefer a higher background at high mass in order to alleviate this possible tension. The background contribution is also increased in the region of the 750 GeV excess, suggesting that the significance of the peak will be reduced when including these additional parameters. \n\nWe note that both the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$ background and the $k = 1$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$ background appear to match closely the background-only fit reported in Fig.~1 of Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1}. The ATLAS collaboration state that they use the $k = 0$ background function in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1} and we therefore assume that they also fit the normalisation $\\mathcal{N}$ of the background, in order to match the results shown here in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BG-only}. It therefore appears then that the background curve used by ATLAS fits the data well, apart from in the region of the 750 GeV excess and above ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}} \\sim 1600 \\text{ GeV}$ (where ATLAS report an excess with $2.8\\sigma$ local significance). \n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{BG-only.pdf}\n\\caption{Background-only fits to the ATLAS diphoton invariant mass spectrum. The observed numbers of events in each bin are shown as black circles, while the curves show the background distribution for the $k = 0$ (red) and $k = 1$ (blue) empirical functions defined in Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}. We show background fits with both free normalisation (solid) and with fixed normalisation (dashed). The background parameters used are those which maximise the likelihood for the background-only hypothesis. Note that the $k = 2$ background fits are not shown as they lie close to the $k = 1$, free normalisation curve (solid blue).}\n\\label{fig:BG-only}\n\\end{figure}\n\nFollowing Ref.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw}, we have calculated the Bayesian Information Crierion (BIC) \\cite{Schwarz1978}, a model selection criterion which be used to compare the fit to data obtained using different models, penalising models which have additional free parameters.

Furthermore, we have taken an empirical approach and allowed a wide range of values for the background parameters $\\mathcal{N}$, $b$, $a_0$, $a_1$, $a_2$. This may not accurately reflect the background distributions seen in MCMC and data samples. However, restricting the possible ranges of the background parameters is likely only to increase the significance of a possible excess. \n\nIn spite of these simplifications, the broad message of this note still holds. The significance of the 750 GeV excess does not appear to be strongly affected by different choices of smooth background model. While more complicated background distributions could be explored to ensure the robustness of the significance reported by ATLAS, these are likely to be highly constrained by the lack of observed events at high diphoton invariant mass.\n\n\n\\acknowledgements\n\nThe author would like to thank the authors of Ref.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw} for stimulating and helpful discussions.

In Fig.~\\ref{fig:Sig+BG}, we show the maximum likelihood fits to the data for the signal + background hypothesis using the free-width analysis for the possible new resonance near 750 GeV. As before, we include fits for $k = 0, 1$ (see Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}) using both free and fixed normalisation, with the colour scheme matching that of Fig.~\\ref{fig:BG-only}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t!]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{Sig+BG.pdf}\n\\caption{Signal + background fits to the ATLAS diphoton invariant mass spectrum, allowing the width of the resonance near 750 GeV to vary freely.

As in Fig.~\\ref{fig:BG-only}, we do not show the fits for $k = 2$, as these lie close to the $k = 1$, free normalisation curve (solid blue).}\n\\label{fig:Sig+BG}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAdding a new resonance near 750 GeV clearly allows the data to be better fit with all background parametrisations. As in the background-only fits, the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$  and $k =1$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$ backgrounds produce similar results. In all cases, the expected rate at high ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ is reduced compared with the background-only fits. With the 750 GeV excess saturated by the signal contribution, the background above 1000 GeV can be reduced to better fit the large number of empty bins.\n\nIn Table~\\ref{tab:significance}, we report the maximum local significance of the ATLAS 750 GeV excess obtained in this work, using each of the functional forms introduced in Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}. For reference, the significances reported by ATLAS in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1} are $3.6\\sigma$ (NWA) and $3.9\\sigma$ (free-width). The significances obtained in this work, using the same background function used by ATLAS, are $3.4\\sigma$ (NWA) and $3.6\\sigma$ (free-width). We discuss in Sec.~\\ref{sec:Discussion} the possible sources of this small discrepancy.\n\nFor the simplest background function ($k = 0$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$) the significance of the excess is significantly larger.\\footnote{We note that we find an even larger significance using this background than that reported by Davis et al.~\\cite{Davis:2016hlw}, though given the different statistical approaches, this is perhaps not surprising.} However, in Sec.~\\ref{sec:BG-only}, we found (in agreement with ATLAS) that this simple function fits the background significantly worse than the more complex ones. The remaining background parametrisations lead to very similar significances compared with the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$ function. Thus, the significance of the excess appears to be robust against the choice of background.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\\centering\n\\label{tab:significance}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{\\hskip 4\\tabcolsep}l@{\\hskip 4\\tabcolsep}l@{}}\n\\toprule\n\\toprule\nBackground function\t\t& NWA & Free-width \\\\\n\\hline \\hline\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Fixed normalisation}\\\\\n$\\qquad k = 0$\t\t\t\t& $4.2\\sigma$\t&  $4.9\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 1$\t\t\t\t& $3.4\\sigma$\t& $3.7\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 2$\t\t\t\t& $3.4\\sigma$    & $3.7\\sigma$ \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{Free normalisation}\\\\\n$\\qquad k = 0^\\dagger$\t\t\t\t& $3.4\\sigma$\t&   $3.6\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 1$\t\t\t\t& $3.5\\sigma$\t&   $3.8\\sigma$ \\\\\n$\\qquad k = 2$\t\t         & $3.4\\sigma$    & $3.6\\sigma$ \\\\\n\\hline\nATLAS reported & $3.6\\sigma$ & $3.9\\sigma$\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Estimated local significance of the ATLAS 750 GeV diphoton excess obtained in this work using each of the background functions described in Eq.~\\ref{eq:functions}, assuming a freely varying resonance width (free-width) and under the narrow width approximation (NWA).

However, this appears to be consistent with the results reported by ATLAS. Assuming that the overall normalisation of the $k=0$ background is also included in the fit, we recover the background-only fit presented in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1} and obtain significances close to (but slightly smaller than) those reported by the ATLAS collaboration.\n\nWe also note that the data show no preference for an increase in complexity of the background function (as demonstrated by the Bayesian Information Criterion study in Table~\\ref{tab:BIC}). Furthermore, we find that adding additional parameters to the background fit does not have any impact on the significance of the excess. This is because of a number of bins above ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}} \\sim 1100 \\text{ GeV}$ which see no events. Any smooth background is constrained not to overshoot these bins. \n\nDavis et al.~introduce a different possible parametrisation for the background (which was also validated by a Monte Carlo study) and find that the significance of the excess is further reduced with respect to the $k = 1$, fixed-$\\mathcal{N}$ case. However, the empty bins at high ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ were not included in that analysis, leading to a background fit which overestimates the high ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ event rate. Indeed, using the Davis et al.~background parametrisation (with free normalisation) in this analysis gives a local significance of $3.8\\sigma$ for a free-width resonance. This does not discount the possibility that exploring a wider range of possible background functions may impact the significance of the 750 GeV excess, but the correct constraints from the entire range of ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ should be taken into account.\n\nIt is of course necessary to point out that the significances we report are only estimates and care must be taken when comparing with the official ATLAS analysis. In particular, the results reported by ATLAS use the full unbinned data set, while we consider here only binned data. Furthermore, this data was obtained by digitising the results released in Ref.~\\cite{ATLAS1}. However, we have investigated the possible impact of digitisation error on our analysis. In order to do this, we added random noise to the first 10 bins in ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ (distributed uniformly between $- 3\\%$ and $+3\\%$ of the number of events in each bin) in order to simulate digitisation errors.\\footnote{At larger values of ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ the small number of events means that integer numbers of events can accurately be read off the figure. However at small values of ${m_{\\gamma \\gamma}}$ digitisation error could induce variations of order 10-100 events.} Ten such `randomised' datasets were generated and the peak significance for each was calculated assuming the $k = 0$, free-$\\mathcal{N}$ background. The resulting local significances were in the range:\n\n\n", "index": 11, "text": "\\begin{align}\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{NWA: } \\quad & 3.3\\sigma \\mbox{--} 3.5 \\sigma\\\\\n\\text{Free-width:} \\quad & 3.5\\sigma \\mbox{--} 3.8\\sigma\\,.\n\\end{split}\n\\end{align}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E6.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\displaystyle\\begin{split}\\displaystyle\\text{NWA: }&amp;\\displaystyle 3.3\\sigma%&#10;\\mbox{--}3.5\\sigma\\\\&#10;\\displaystyle\\text{Free-width:}&amp;\\displaystyle 3.5\\sigma\\mbox{--}3.8\\sigma\\,.%&#10;\\end{split}\" display=\"inline\"><mtable columnspacing=\"0pt\" rowspacing=\"0pt\"><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"right\"><mtext>NWA:\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mn>3.3</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>\u2013</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>3.5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign=\"right\"><mtext>Free-width:</mtext></mtd><mtd columnalign=\"left\"><mrow><mrow><mn>3.5</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mtext>\u2013</mtext><mo>\u2062</mo><mn>3.8</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>\u03c3</mi></mpadded></mrow><mo>.</mo></mrow></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>", "type": "latex"}]
