Such soft elastic modes strongly affect transport  \\cite{Baldi10,Xu09} as well as linear elastic response and its fluctuations \\cite{Leonforte06,Lerner14,Karimi15,Ellenbroek06}. They also contribute to non-linear properties such as thermal activation \\cite{Brito07,Hocky12} and plasticity \\cite{Manning11}. In some cases, they even control the structure of the material, including in soft elastic particles near jamming \\cite{Wyart05a} and  dense colloidal glasses \\cite{ Brito09,DeGiuli14b} where the structure is marginally stable: soft elastic modes different from plane waves are present down to zero frequency. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond  amorphous solids,  soft elastic modes are also central to designed materials with controlled \\cite{Florijn14} and sometimes topological properties \\cite{Kane14,Paulose15}. \n\nPackings of soft particles are a very convenient system to study these soft elastic modes, as vibrational properties display scaling near their jamming transition \\cite{Hecke10,Liu10,Ohern03}. In particular, there is a frequency scale $\\omega^*\\sim \\delta z=z-z_c$  beyond which the density of vibrational modes $D(\\omega)$ displays a plateau \n\\cite{Wyart05a,Silbert05}. Here  $z$ is the coordination, and $z_c=2d$ is the  isostatic value where $d$ is the spatial dimension. The transverse structure factor at $\\omega^*$ indicates a correlation length $l_c\\sim 1/\\sqrt{\\delta z}$  \\cite{Silbert05}. These results can be derived using effective medium theory \\cite{Wyart10a}.\nHowever, the first proposed derivation for the density of states was variational \\cite{Wyart05}. It used  Maxwell's result that in networks with $z<z_c$, floppy modes with no restoring force must appear. In  \\cite{Wyart05}  planes of contacts as depicted in Fig.~\\ref{f2} were cut to generate floppy modes, from which trial modes could be made.  Using the hypothesis that floppy modes extend through the system led to the correct scaling for $\\omega^*$ and its associated plateau.   However, a very recent numerical work supports that most of the floppy modes are in fact localized near the boundaries where the system is cut \\cite{Sussman15}, raising doubts on the applicability of that argument. Here we provide a novel variational argument that does not make any hypothesis on the geometry of floppy modes, and numerically confirm its validity. Interestingly, the argument requires to add springs instead of cutting them. The argument emphasizes that the characteristic volume of soft elastic modes scales as $1/\\delta z$, which is also the volume where finite size effects set in.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{networks1.eps}\n\\caption{ Left: illustrative diagram of the previous cutting argument of \\cite{Wyart05}, showing cut bonds in blue (dashed lines).

The latter is built from a strongly compressed bi-disperse soft particles with rest size ratio $1.4:1$, for which the forces in the bonds are set to zero. Next, we find and remove the spring connecting the nodes with the highest coordination, until isostaticity is reached.  The ``red bonds\" shown in the right panel of Fig.~\\ref{f2} are precisely  those that were removed to reach isostaticity; the first to be added are the last that were removed in that process. We consider both two dimension (2D) and three dimension (3D) with $N$ varying from $64$ to $4096$ and $q$ varying from $1/N$ to $0.5$. \n({\\it ii}) The contact network of a  packing at jamming is also isostatic.\nWe construct such isostatic networks by decompressing the bi-disperse soft particle packings with the same size ratio as above. We track the configurations during the decompression. The  red springs we add in our arguments are precisely chosen as the contact lost when the packing was decompressed; once again, the first red springs we add are the last contacts which opened in the decompression protocol.  We consider two dimensional packings of size $N=400$ to $6400$ at pressure $p=1\\times10^{-5}$ to $1\\times10^{-1}$.\n\n\nWe compute frequencies as defined in Eq.(\\ref{10}) both for the response to elongating one spring $|{\\bf\\delta R_{\\alpha}}\\rangle$ and the orthogonal trial modes $|{\\bf\\delta R_{\\lambda}}\\rangle$. This is done for the two types networks as $q$ is varied. Average values of for these frequencies are shown in Fig.~\\ref{f3}. \nBoth our scaling prediction $\\omega_\\alpha \\sim q$ and  Eq.(\\ref{14}) are found to be satisfied. The inequality Eq.(\\ref{14}) becomes better satisfied with growing system size, indicating that it holds in the thermodynamic limit, and proving the validity of our argument. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion} \nWe have argued that  a variational argument for packings near jamming can be made by exciting the system in its bulk, rather than at its boundary. The physical picture it provides is that soft elastic modes of frequency $\\omega$ at jamming are similar to the response to a local strain in a system of coordination $\\delta z\\sim \\omega$.  Away from jamming (i.e. for $\\delta z>0$),  the softest elastic modes can be localized (in the sense of fixing the ratio of their squared norm over their squared maximum displacement)  on a volume $1/\\omega^*\\sim 1/\\delta z$ without significantly increasing their frequency. This picture   shares similarity with the  description of dense granular and suspensions flows presented in  \\cite{Degiuli15a}. In that case, the contact network is hypostatic ($\\delta z<0$), and flow occurs along floppy modes whose characteristic volume is precisely $\\sim 1/|\\delta z|$, which also corresponds to the characteristic finite size volume beyond which scaling holds. \n\nThe characteristic volume $N_{\\rm f.s.}\\sim 1/\\delta z$ may seem to contradict effective medium results and numerics, which indicates that the  length scale  characterizing the decay of most of the amplitude of the response to a local strain is $l_c\\sim 1/\\sqrt{\\delta z}$ both for floppy \\cite{During13} and jammed materials \\cite{Lerner14}. There is however no contradiction:  it simply signals that the leading term of the response  decays  with distance $r$ as $\\delta R^2_\\alpha(r)\\sim f(r/l_c)/r^{d-2}$, where $f(x)$ is a rapidly decaying function of its argument.\n\nWe expect  our argument to be robust to disorder in the spring stiffness, as long as they are not too many weak springs in the system.\nWhen this occurs, better variational arguments can be designed that cut the weakest springs and consider the resulting floppy modes as trial modes.\nThese arguments are necessary to describe thermal effects on vibrational properties in packings of soft particles \\cite{Degiuli15} as well as hard sphere systems \\cite{DeGiuli14b}. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we expect our lower bound on the density of states to hold for generic isostatic networks. An interesting case are ``directed\" isostatic networks  where the geometry of floppy modes can be computed layer by layer. These networks can present  interesting topological properties \\cite{Kane14,Paulose15,Lubensky15}. They also present curious finite size effects \\cite{Moukarzel12} when mixed  boundary conditions (one side pinned and one side free) are used.  We expect however that finite size effects are similar to those discussed here when periodic boundaries are used in disordered networks. We have checked that our prediction on the linear dependence of $\\omega_\\alpha$ and $\\omega_\\lambda$ with the density of added springs $q$ holds true for a distorted square lattice, which is ``directed\".  \n\n\n\\acknowledgements\nWe are grateful to T.~Lubensky and D.~Sussman for discussions and for sharing unpublished data, and thank E.
