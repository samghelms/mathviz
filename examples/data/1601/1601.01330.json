One promising approach to constrain this feedback is through measurements of spectral distortions in the cosmic microwave background due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel\u00d5dovich (tSZ) effect, whose magnitude is directly proportional to the energy input by AGN.  With current instruments, making such measurements requires stacking large numbers of objects to increase signal-to-noise.   While one possible target for such stacks are AGN themselves, these are relatively scarce sources that contain contaminating emission that complicates tSZ measurements.   Here we adopt an alternative approach and co-add South Pole Telescope SZ (SPT-SZ) survey data around a large set of massive quiescent  elliptical galaxies at $z \\geq 0.5$, which are much more numerous and less contaminated than active AGN, yet are subject to the same feedback processes from the AGN they hosted in the past. We use data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey and VISTA Hemisphere Survey to create a large catalog of galaxies split up into two redshift bins, with 3394 galaxies at $0.5\\leq z \\leq 1.0$ and 924 galaxies at $1.0\\leq z \\leq 1.5,$ with typical stellar masses of $1.5 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot.$ We then co-add the emission around these galaxies, resulting in a measured tSZ signal at $2.2\\sigma$ significance for the lower redshift bin and a contaminating signal at $1.1\\sigma$ for the higher redshift bin. To remove contamination due to dust emission, we use SPT-SZ source counts to model a contaminant source population in both the SPT-SZ bands and Planck high-frequency bands for a subset of 937 galaxies in the low-redshift bin and 240 galaxies in the high-redshift bin. This increases our detection to $3.6\\sigma$ for low redshifts and $0.9\\sigma$ for high redshifts. We find the mean angularly-integrated Compton-$y$ values to be $2.2_ {-0.7}^{+0.9} \\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ for low redshifts and $1.7_ {-1.8}^{+2.2} \\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ for high redshifts, corresponding to total thermal energies of $7.6_ {-2.3}^{+3.0} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs and $6.0_{-6.3}^{+7.7} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs, respectively. These numbers are higher than expected from simple theoretical models that do not include AGN feedback, and serve as constraints that can be applied to current simulations of massive galaxy formation. \n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\keywords{cosmic microwave background -- \n          galaxies: evolution  -- \n          quasars: general --\n          intergalactic medium -- \n          large-scale structure of the universe}\n          \n\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\n\nIn the prevailing model of galaxy formation, the collapse of baryonic matter follows the collapse of overdense regions of dark matter \\citep[e.g.][]{White1978,White1991,Kauffmann1993,Lacey1993}.  Over time, these dark matter halos accrete and merge to form deep gravitational potential wells.  These, in turn, lead to strong gravitationally-powered shocks that cause the inflowing gas to be heated to high temperatures.   To collapse and form stars, the gas must radiate this energy away, a process that takes longer in the largest, most gravitationally bound structures \\citep[e.g.][]{Binney1977,Silk1977,Rees1977}.  Furthermore, galaxies also accrete and merge over time within their dark matter halos, a processes that appears to be closely linked to the evolution of active galactic nuclei \\citep[AGN; e.g.][]{Richstone1998,Cattaneo1999,Kauffmann2000,Menci2006}. Together, these processes point to a hierarchical picture in which larger star-forming galaxies, hosting larger AGN,  form at later times as larger dark matter halos coalesce and more gas cools and condenses.\n\nOn the other hand, an increasing amount of observational evidence suggests that recent trends in galaxy and AGN evolution were anti-hierarchical. More massive galaxies appear to be forming stars at higher redshift, and since $z\\approx2$ the characteristic mass of star-forming galaxies appears to have dropped by more than a factor of 3 \\citep{Cowie1996,Brinchmann2004,Kodama2004,Treu2005,Feulner2005,Bauer2005,Bundy2005,Papovich2006,Noeske2007,Cowie2008,Drory2008,Vergani2008}. Similarly, since $z\\approx2$ the characteristic AGN luminosity has dropped by more than a factor of 10, indicating that the typical masses of active supermassive black holes were larger in the past \\citep{Pei1995,Ueda2003,Barger2005,Buchner2015}. While it has been argued that this observed ``downsizing'' is a natural result of the standard hierarchical framework \\citep[e.g.][]{Enoki2014}, most work has suggested that it requires additional heating of the circumgalactic medium by AGN feedback \\citep{Merloni2004,Scannapieco2004,Scannapieco2005,Bower2006,Neistein2006,Thacker2006,Sijacki2007,Merloni2008,Chen2009,Hirschmann2012,Mocz2013,Hirschmann2014, Lapi2014, Schaye2015}. \n\nIn a general AGN feedback model \\citep[e.g.][]{Scannapieco2005}, energetic AGN outflows due to broad absorption-line winds and/or radio jets blow cool gas out of the galaxy and/or heat the nearby intergalactic medium (IGM) enough to suppress the cooling needed to form further generations of stars and AGN. This quenching is redshift dependent, as the higher-redshift IGM is more dense and rapidly radiating and therefore a highly energetic outflow driven by a large AGN is required to have effective feedback. In the less dense lower-redshift IGM,  a less energetic outflow by a smaller AGN can produce similar cooling times. This means that at lower redshifts the AGN in smaller galaxies can exert efficient feedback, preventing larger galaxies from forming stars, suppressing AGN accretion, and resulting in the cosmic downsizing that we observe.\n\nThere has been significant observational evidence of AGN feedback in action in galaxies and clusters, primarily in the form of radio jets \\citep{Schawinski2007,Rafferty2008,Fabian2012,Farrah2012,Page2012}. Galaxies near the center of clusters show a boosted likelihood of hosting large radio-loud jets of AGN-driven material \\citep{Burns1990, Best2005, McNamara2005}, whose energies are comparable to those needed to stop the gas from cooling \\citep[e.g.][]{Simionescu2009}. Furthermore, AGN feedback from the central cD galaxies in clusters increases in proportion to the cooling luminosity, as expected in an operational feedback loop \\citep[e.g.][]{Birzan2004, Rafferty2006}.\n\nDirect measurements of the characteristic heating of the interstellar medium and surrounding IGM by AGN feedback have been more difficult due to the relatively high redshifts and faint signals involved. Broad absorption line outflows are observed as blueshifted troughs in the rest-frame spectra of $\\approx 20\\%$ of all of quasars \\citep{Hewett2003, Ganguly2008, Knigge2008}. However, quantifying AGN feedback requires estimating mass-flow and the energy released by these outflows \\citep[e.g.][]{Wampler1995,Hamann2001,deKool2001,Feruglio2010,Sturm2011,Veilleux2013}. These quantities, in turn, can only be computed in cases for which it is possible to estimate the distance to the outflowing material from the central source, which is often highly uncertain.  While these measurements have been carried out for a select set of objects  \\citep[e.g.][]{Chartas2007,Moe2009,Dunn2010,Borguet2013,Chamberlain2015}, it is still unclear how these results generalize to AGN as a whole.   At the same time it is still an open question whether AGN outflows triggered by galaxy interactions actually quench star formation in massive, high-redshift galaxies \\citep[e.g.][]{Fontanot2009,Pipino2009, Debuhr2010,Ostriker2010,Faucher2012,Newton2013,Feldmann2015}.\n\nA promising method for quantifying the effect of AGN feedback is through measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. The CMB has large-scale anisotropies that have been measured in great detail and provide insight into the cosmological parameters that shape our Universe \\citep[e.g.][]{PlanckCollaboration2015}. At angular scales smaller than $\\approx$ 5 arcminutes, though, Silk damping washes out the primary CMB anisotropies \\citep{Silk1968,PlanckCollaboration2015}, leaving room for secondary anisotropies. This includes the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, where CMB photons are scattered by hot, ionized gas \\citep{Sunyaev1970,Sunyaev1972}. If the gas is sufficiently heated, inverse Compton scattering will shift the CMB photons to higher energies. This thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect directly depends on the thermal energy of the free electrons that the CMB radiation passes through, and it has a unique spectral signature that makes it well suited to measuring the heating of gas and characterizing AGN feedback \\citep{Voit1994,Natarajan1999,Birkinshaw1999,Platania2002,Lapi2003,Chatterjee2007,Scannapieco2008,Chatterjee2008,Battaglia2010}. On the other hand, if an object is moving along the line of sight with respect to the CMB rest frame, then the Doppler effect will lead to an observed distortion of the CMB spectrum, referred to as the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The magnitude of this effect is proportional to the overall column depth of the gas times the velocity of the line of sight motion, and its spectral signature is indistinguishable from primary CMB anisotropies.\n\nThe expected tSZ distortion per source is too small to be detected by current instruments \\citep[e.g.][]{Scannapieco2008}, and so a stacking method must be applied to many sources in order to derive a significant signal from them. \\citet{Chatterjee2009} found a tentative detection of quasar feedback using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), although it is ambiguous how much of their detected signal is due to AGN feedback and how much is due to other processes \\citep[see][]{Ruan2015}. \\cite{Hand2011} stacked $>$2,300 SDSS-selected ``luminous red galaxies'' in data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and found a $2.1\\sigma-3.8\\sigma$ tSZ detection after selecting radio-quiet galaxies and binning them by luminosity.  \\cite{Gralla2014} stacked data from ACT at the positions of a large sample of radio AGN selected at 1.4 GHz to make a 5$\\sigma$ detection of the tSZ effect associated with the haloes that host active AGN.  \\citet{Greco2014} used Planck full mission temperature maps to examine the stacked tSZ signal of 188,042 ``locally brightest galaxies'' selected from the SDSS Data Release 7, finding a significant measurement of the stacked tSZ signal from galaxies with stellar masses above $\\approx 2 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$.  \\citet{Ruan2015} stacked Planck tSZ Compton-$y$ maps centered on the locations of 26,686 spectroscopic quasars identified from SDSS to estimate the mean thermal energies in gas surrounding such $z \\approx 1.5$  quasars to be $\\approx {10^{62}}$ ergs. On the contrary, \\citet{Cen2015} used a statistical analysis of stacked $y$ maps of quasar hosts using the \\textit{Millennium Simulation} and found that, with the 10 arcmin full width at half maximum (FWHM) resolution of their Planck stacking process, the results of \\citet{Ruan2015} could be explained by gravitational heating alone, with a maximum feedback energy of about 25\\% their stated value. In addition, they found that a 1 arcmin FWHM beam is much more favorable in distinguishing between quasar feedback models. \\citet{Crichton2015} stacked $>$17,000 radio-quiet quasars from SDSS in ACT data and found $3\\sigma$ evidence for the presence of associated thermalized gas and $4\\sigma$ evidence for the thermal coupling of quasars to their surrounding medium. These initial tSZ AGN feedback measurements using quasars are promising, and they continue to motivate direct measurements that probe different AGN feedback regimes, especially at the 1 arcmin FWHM resolution of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) that will be used in this work.\n\nAlthough quasars are a popular target for measuring AGN feedback due to their brightness and their active feedback processes, their drawbacks are that they are relatively scarce and contain contaminating emission that obscures the signatures of AGN feedback. In this paper, we focus on measuring co-added tSZ distortions in the CMB around massive ($\\geq10^{11} M_\\odot$) quiescent elliptical galaxies at moderate redshifts ($0.5\\leq z \\leq 1.5$) using data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey \\citep[BCS;][]{Desai2012}, VISTA Hemisphere Survey \\citep[VHS;][]{Mcmahon2012}, and South Pole Telescope SZ survey \\citep[SPT-SZ;][]{Schaffer2011}, in order to characterize the energy injected by the AGN they once hosted. These galaxies contain almost no dust and are very numerous on the sky, making them well-suited for co-adding in large numbers in order to obtain good constraints on the energy stored in the gas that surrounds them.\n\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: In $\\S$2, we give an overview of the tSZ effect and provide a theoretical basis for our tSZ results. In $\\S$3, we describe the data that we use from the BCS, VHS, and SPT-SZ survey. In $\\S$4, we describe our method of selecting optimal galaxies for our measurements. In $\\S$5, we describe how we generate a reliable catalog of sources and the parameters that describe their properties. In $\\S$6, we describe how we generate the final catalog of galaxies for our tSZ measurements. In $\\S$7, we describe our SPT-SZ filtering, the galaxy co-add process, and our overall results. This includes the initial measurements, $\\chi^2$ statistics using just the SPT-SZ data, $\\chi^2$ statistics incorporating Planck data, and a goodness-of-fit test using the Anderson-Darling statistic. In $\\S$8, we summarize our results, discuss the implications for AGN feedback, and provide conclusions.\n\nThroughout this work, we adopt a $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model with parameters \\citep[from][]{PlanckCollaboration2015}, $h=0.68$, $\\Omega_0$ = 0.31, $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ = 0.69, and $\\Omega_b = 0.049$, where $h$ is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and $\\Omega_0$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda$, and $\\Omega_b$ are the total matter, vacuum, and baryonic densities, respectively, in\nunits of the critical density.

Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile using the Mosaic II imager with $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands. The filter centers, effective widths, and magnitude limits are given in Table \\ref{tab:bands}.\n\nThe BCS data is split up into many smaller 36 $\\times$ 36 arcmin (8192 $\\times$ 8192 pixel) images called tiles, with $\\approx$1 arcmin overlap between neighboring tiles. Each pixel subtends 0.27 arcseconds on the sky. As described in \\citet{Desai2012}, each raw data tile is put through a detrending pipeline, which consists of crosstalk corrections, overscan, flatfield, bias and illumination correction, and astrometric calibration. The average full width at half maximum of the seeing disk in the single epoch images ranges between 0.7 and 1.6 arseconds. Each tile is then put through a co-addition pipeline that combines data taken over the same locations on the sky to build deeper single images. This results in a co-added tile image and an inverse-variance weightmap (confidence image) for each tile region of the survey. We use the area of the BCS that overlaps with the VHS and SPT-SZ, known as the \\textit{5 hr field} (referring to its right ascension). This dataset consists of 135 tiles and their associated weightmaps for each band, covering $\\approx$ 45 deg$^2$.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{The VISTA Hemisphere Survey}\n\\label{sec:vhs}\n\nThe VHS \\citep{Mcmahon2012} is a large-scale near-infrared survey  whose goal is to survey the entire southern celestial hemisphere ($\\approx$ 20,000 deg$^2$). The survey component in which we are interested is called the VHS DES (DES because it overlaps with the Dark Energy Survey), a 5000 deg$^2$ region that is imaged with 120 second exposure times in the $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ bands (see Table \\ref{tab:bands}). The data was obtained from 2009 to 2011 on the 4.1m Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\nThe VHS data is split up into $\\approx$ 2 $\\times$ 1.5 deg ($\\approx$12,770 $\\times$ 15,660 pixel) tiles. Each pixel subtends 0.33 arcseconds on the sky. As described on the VISTA data processing web page\\footnote{http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/vista/technical/ data-processing}, the raw VHS data goes through a pipeline that involves reset correction, dark correction, linearity correction, flat field correction, sky background correction, destripe, jitter stacking, astrometric and photometric calibration, and tile generation. Tiles are generated from six smaller, stacked pawprints, each containing 16 even smaller detector-level images\\footnote{http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/ surveys-projects/vista/technical/ tiles}, and the median image seeing as measured from stellar FWHM on VHS pawprints ranges from 0.89 arcseconds in $K_s$ to 0.99 arcseconds in $J$.  The stacked paw prints then  result in a science-ready tile image and inverse-variance weightmap for each tile region of the survey. We are interested in the area of the VHS that overlaps with the BCS (see Fig.\\ 1). This results in 20 tiles and their associated weightmaps, covering $\\approx$ 55 deg$^2$.\n\n\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n\\subsection{The South Pole Telescope SZ Survey}\n\\label{sec:spt}\n\nThe SPT-SZ survey \\citep{Schaffer2011} used the 10m South Pole Telescope (SPT) at the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station  to survey a large area of the sky at mm and sub-mm wavelengths with arcminute angular resolution and low noise \\citep{Ruhl2004, Padin2008, Carlstrom2011}. The  survey observed 2500 deg$^2$ of the southern sky during the austral winter seasons of 2008 through 2011. Data from the 2011 release that we are using covers $\\approx$ 95 deg$^2$ to a depth of 17 and 41 $\\mu$K arcmin at 150 GHz and 220 GHz, respectively, centered at (RA, dec) = (82.7, -55) degrees (see Table \\ref{tab:bands}).\n\nThe SPT-SZ data is contained in a single image per band, $\\approx$ 20 $\\times$ 10 deg ($\\approx$3000 $\\times$ 3000 pixels) projected as either a Sanson-Flamsteed projection or an oblique Lambert equal-area azimuthal projection. The Sanson-Flamsteed projection is most useful for cluster-finding and contains masked point-sources, while the Lambert projection is most useful for point-source analysis. Since we are interested in individual sources that are undetected and within the noise level, we use the Sanson-Flamsteed projection with point-sources masked. Each pixel subtends 15 arcseconds on the sky. As described in \\citet{Schaffer2011}, the raw data goes through a pre-processing stage where the data from a single observation of the field is calibrated, data selection cuts are applied, and initial filtering and instrument characterization are performed. A map-making stage with additional filtering is performed on the pre-processed data and the data are binned into single-observation maps used for final co-adds. The final data products include a co-added image, two-dimensional beam functions, filter transfer functions, and noise power spectral densities for each band.\n\nIt is worth noting that 220 GHz is very close to the frequency at which there is no change in the CMB due to the tSZ effect ($\\nu_{\\text{null}}$ = 217.6 GHz), while 150 GHz, which is close to the peak of the undistorted CMB spectrum (160 GHz), will see a decrement in radiation. Eqs.\\ (\\ref{eq:DeltaT}) and (\\ref{eq:x}) can be rewritten for these bands, though the equations must now involve integration over the SPT filter curves.

The data was obtained from 2009 to 2011 on the 4.1m Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.\n\nThe VHS data is split up into $\\approx$ 2 $\\times$ 1.5 deg ($\\approx$12,770 $\\times$ 15,660 pixel) tiles. Each pixel subtends 0.33 arcseconds on the sky. As described on the VISTA data processing web page\\footnote{http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/surveys-projects/vista/technical/ data-processing}, the raw VHS data goes through a pipeline that involves reset correction, dark correction, linearity correction, flat field correction, sky background correction, destripe, jitter stacking, astrometric and photometric calibration, and tile generation. Tiles are generated from six smaller, stacked pawprints, each containing 16 even smaller detector-level images\\footnote{http://casu.ast.cam.ac.uk/ surveys-projects/vista/technical/ tiles}, and the median image seeing as measured from stellar FWHM on VHS pawprints ranges from 0.89 arcseconds in $K_s$ to 0.99 arcseconds in $J$.  The stacked paw prints then  result in a science-ready tile image and inverse-variance weightmap for each tile region of the survey. We are interested in the area of the VHS that overlaps with the BCS (see Fig.\\ 1). This results in 20 tiles and their associated weightmaps, covering $\\approx$ 55 deg$^2$.\n\n\n\n\\pagebreak\n\n\\subsection{The South Pole Telescope SZ Survey}\n\\label{sec:spt}\n\nThe SPT-SZ survey \\citep{Schaffer2011} used the 10m South Pole Telescope (SPT) at the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station  to survey a large area of the sky at mm and sub-mm wavelengths with arcminute angular resolution and low noise \\citep{Ruhl2004, Padin2008, Carlstrom2011}. The  survey observed 2500 deg$^2$ of the southern sky during the austral winter seasons of 2008 through 2011. Data from the 2011 release that we are using covers $\\approx$ 95 deg$^2$ to a depth of 17 and 41 $\\mu$K arcmin at 150 GHz and 220 GHz, respectively, centered at (RA, dec) = (82.7, -55) degrees (see Table \\ref{tab:bands}).\n\nThe SPT-SZ data is contained in a single image per band, $\\approx$ 20 $\\times$ 10 deg ($\\approx$3000 $\\times$ 3000 pixels) projected as either a Sanson-Flamsteed projection or an oblique Lambert equal-area azimuthal projection. The Sanson-Flamsteed projection is most useful for cluster-finding and contains masked point-sources, while the Lambert projection is most useful for point-source analysis. Since we are interested in individual sources that are undetected and within the noise level, we use the Sanson-Flamsteed projection with point-sources masked. Each pixel subtends 15 arcseconds on the sky. As described in \\citet{Schaffer2011}, the raw data goes through a pre-processing stage where the data from a single observation of the field is calibrated, data selection cuts are applied, and initial filtering and instrument characterization are performed. A map-making stage with additional filtering is performed on the pre-processed data and the data are binned into single-observation maps used for final co-adds. The final data products include a co-added image, two-dimensional beam functions, filter transfer functions, and noise power spectral densities for each band.\n\nIt is worth noting that 220 GHz is very close to the frequency at which there is no change in the CMB due to the tSZ effect ($\\nu_{\\text{null}}$ = 217.6 GHz), while 150 GHz, which is close to the peak of the undistorted CMB spectrum (160 GHz), will see a decrement in radiation. Eqs.\\ (\\ref{eq:DeltaT}) and (\\ref{eq:x}) can be rewritten for these bands, though the equations must now involve integration over the SPT filter curves.

Thus, the  first step to constraining AGN feedback is selecting an appropriate set of objects around which to co-add CMB data.  Here one must balance several competing concerns. At the earliest times, when the most luminous AGN are in the midst of heating the surrounding gas, tSZ measurements are particularly difficult. This is both because emission from the AGN and its host are likely to contribute in the interesting 100-300 GHz frequency range, as well as because the low number density of such sources makes it very difficult to co-add them in meaningful numbers using the SPT data we are working with \\citep[although with a large field and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting it is possible to extract a tSZ signal, i.e.][]{Gralla2014}. On the other hand, the cooling times of regions heated by the most luminous AGN are likely to be longer than the Hubble time \\citep[e.g.][]{Scannapieco2004}, making the heated gas we are interested in detectable long after the active AGN phase has passed. Furthermore, at the lowest redshifts, the largest bulge galaxies will be absorbed into galaxy clusters, where gravitational heating effects will be sufficiently large as to make AGN feedback processes difficult to distinguish. \n\nFor these reasons, we restrict our attention to elliptical galaxies, rather than luminous AGN or dusty late-type galaxies, and select only galaxies with redshifts greater than $z=0.5.$ The left panel of Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:candidates} illustrates the $g,$ $z,$ and $K_s$ band magnitudes of ellipticals as a function of age and mass, computed from GALAXEV population synthesis models \\citep{Bruzual2003} (for band information see Table \\ref{tab:bands}). Here we have taken a star formation history $\\propto$ exp(-t/$\\tau$), where $\\tau$ = 0.51 Gyr, and ages of 1, 2, and 4 Gyr.  Note that in the standard cosmology, the age of the universe at $z$ = 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2.0 is 8.5, 5.9, 4.3, and 3.3 Gyr, respectively.\n\nIn Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:candidates} we have also plotted the magnitude limits of the BCS and VHS data.   By comparing the models and limits we can see that large passive galaxies are indeed detectable in this data at a wide range of  redshifts above $z=0.5$.  In particular, galaxies with ages $\\approx$ 1 Gyr with stellar masses above $10^{11} \\, M_\\odot$  are detectable in both the optical and infrared data from $z=0.5$ to 1.2 while 1 Gyr galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{11.5} \\, M_\\odot$ are detectable out to $z=2$.  At ages of 2 Gyrs,  galaxies with stellar masses above 10$^{11}$ $M_\\odot$ are detectable out to $z=1.0$  and  galaxies with stellar masses above 10$^{11.5}$ $M_\\odot$ are detectable out to $z=1.6$.  Finally, for an age of 4 Gyrs, galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{11} \\, M_\\odot$ can be detected out to  $z=0.7,$ and galaxies with stellar masses above $10^{11.5} \\, M_\\odot$ can be detected out to $z=1.2$.\n\nThe right panel of Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:candidates} shows that we can also use $g-z$ vs. $z-K_s$ colors to cleanly separate $\\gtrsim 1$ Gyr old galaxies at $0.5\\leq z \\leq 1.5$ from stars and star-forming systems, making use  of the $gzK_s$ method outlined in \\citet{Arcila-Osejo2013} \\citep[see also][]{Daddi2004,Cameron2011}.\nIn particular, by applying a cut\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 33964, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\Delta T_{150}$ and $\\Delta T_{220}$ are the temperature anisotropies at 150 and 220 GHz, respectively.\nHere we can explicitly see that, for the same $y$, the increase in $\\Delta T_{220}$ is about 24 times less than the decrease in $\\Delta T_{150}$.

Because  the BCS and VHS tiles are different sizes and in different locations (see Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:tiles}), we consider every possible overlap between images when aligning the other data to the $K_s$ tiles.   We then match pixel sizes and locations, and to insure that fixed aperture flux measurements are consistent between bands, we also match the seeing between the $K_s$ tiles and the other bands.\n\nIf the $K_s$ tile has worse seeing than the other band, we simply degrade the other image with a Gaussian filter until it matches\nthe FWHM of the $K_s$ image.  On the other hand,  if the $K_s$ image has better seeing, we degrade it to match the other band, compute the ratio of 3-arcsec-diameter aperture fluxes between the two bands described below, and finally multiply the ratio by the  3-arcsec-diameter flux measured from the unconvolved $K_s.$  That is, we compute and apply an aperture correction as  Flux$_{grizJH}$ = Flux$_{grizJH,0}$ $\\times$ (Flux$_{K_s,0}$ / Flux$_{K_s,\\text{degraded}}$), where $0$ denotes the non-degraded measurement.  This is done to preserve both accurate colors and the best possible $K_s$ flux in every case, since that is the most important band for our purposes. Note that, since the seeing is nearly the same for all tiles ($\\approx 1$ arcsec, see Table \\ref{tab:bands}), this correction is minor, with a mean ratio (Flux$_{K_s,0}$ / Flux$_{K_s,\\text{degraded}}$) of 1.026 across all tiles.\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{14cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\t\\hline\n\tConfiguration parameter & Value & Configuration parameter & Value \\\\ \\hline\n\t\\texttt{DETECT\\_TYPE} & ccd & \\texttt{PHOT\\_AUTOPARAMS} & 2.5,3.5 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DETECT\\_MINAREA} & 4 & \\texttt{PHOT\\_AUTOAPERS} & 0.0,0.0 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{THRESH\\_TYPE} & relative & \\texttt{SATUR\\_LEVEL} & 32,000 (VHS) \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DETECT\\_THRESH} & 3.0 &  & 20,000 (BCS) \\\\\n\t\\texttt{ANALYSIS\\_THRESH} & 3.0 & \\texttt{GAIN} & 4.2 (VHS)  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{FILTER} & y &  & 0 (BCS) \\\\\n\t\\texttt{FILTER\\_NAME} & gauss\\_3.0\\_3x3.conv & \\texttt{PIXEL\\_SCALE} & 0 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DEBLEND\\_NTHRESH} & 32 & \\texttt{BACKPHOTO\\_TYPE} & local  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DEBLEND\\_MINCONT} & 0.005 & \\texttt{BACKPHOTO\\_THICK} & 24  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{CLEAN} & y & \\texttt{BACK\\_TYPE} & auto  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{CLEAN\\_PARAM} & 1.0 & \\texttt{BACK\\_VALUE} & 3.0  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{MASK\\_TYPE} & correct & \\texttt{BACK\\_SIZE} & 64 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{WEIGHT\\_TYPE} & map\\_weight & \\texttt{BACK\\_FILTERSIZE} & 3 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{WEIGHT\\_GAIN} & n & \\texttt{BACK\\_FILTERTHRESH} & 0.0  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{RESCALE\\_WEIGHTS} & y & \\texttt{MEMORY\\_OBJSTACK} & 10,000 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{PHOT\\_APERTURES} & 9 & \\texttt{MEMORY\\_PIXSTACK} & 1,500,000 \\\\\n\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} }\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\caption{\\small SExtractor input parameters for all $K_s$-aligned tiles.}\n\\label{tab:sex}\t\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Detecting and Measuring Sources}\n\\label{sec:sex}\n\nTo detect and measure every object in our field, we use the SExtractor software package, version 2.8.6 \\citep{Bertin1996}\\footnote{SExtractor v2.13 User's manual, E. Bertin}$^{, }$\\footnote{https://www.astromatic.net/pubsvn/software/sextractor/ trunk/doc/sextractor}. The code detects and measures sources in an image through the following five step process:\n(i) it creates a background map that estimates the noise at every pixel in the image; (ii)  it detects sources using a thresholding technique; (iii) it uses a multiple isophotal analysis technique to deblend objects; (iv) it throws out spurious detections made in the wings of larger objects; and (v) it estimates the flux of each remaining object.  Each of these steps can be adjusted by the user through configuration parameters, and we list our choice of these parameters for both BCS and VHS tiles in Table \\ref{tab:sex}.\n\nIn all cases, we use SExtractor's dual-image mode, which allows us to measure fluxes in all bands from sources detected in the $K_s$ band. This results in a catalog of $K_s$-detected sources with \\texttt{MAG\\_AUTO} and 3-arcsec-diameter aperture flux measurements in every band.  We use corrected  \\texttt{MAG\\_AUTO} for our final catalogs and the 3-arcsec-diameter aperture  \\texttt{MAG\\_APER} to compute aperture corrections as described in \\S\\ref{sec:matching}. Finally, the overlap between tiles within both the BCS and VHS images leads to some sources being detected in multiple tiles.  To correct for this, we match our catalog with itself and  remove multiple occurrences of sources within 1 arcsec of each other. At this point in the analysis, our full catalog contains 565,561 sources, 168,944 (30\\%) of which are identified as duplicates. This leaves 396,617 total sources.\n\n\nTo confirm the reliability of our measurements, we compare our  $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ magnitudes with the source catalog released with the public VHS data. In particular, we  select stars from our catalog using Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:stars}), with $<$ instead of $\\geq,$ and SExtractor \\texttt{FLAGS} = 0 and match them with a random 10,000 source subset of the pre-made VHS catalog, where we define a match as  two sources within 0.5 arcsec of each other.  Note that our magnitudes are measured within 3-arcsec-diameter apertures while the pre-made catalog uses $2.83$-arcsec-diameter apertures.\nA plot of the difference in magnitudes between our catalog and the pre-made VHS catalog can be seen in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:vhscompare}. To remove extreme outliers, magnitudes from both catalogs are cut at the depths given in Table \\ref{tab:bands}. The mean offsets from 0 in the magnitude differences are -0.11, -0.05, and -0.03 mags for $J$, $H$, and $K_s$, respectively. The mean photometric uncertainty in those offsets across all magnitudes are $\\pm$0.09, $\\pm$0.12, and $\\pm$0.18 mags, respectively. The solid lines in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:vhscompare} represent the mean uncertainty within magnitude bins of width 1 mag, and they are plotted as positive offsets from 0 on the $y$-axis. The uncertainty includes any differences in the measurement process between this paper and \\citet{Mcmahon2012}, as well as the inherent uncertainty in the SExtractor measurements. As can be seen, the difference in magnitudes is reasonably within the uncertainty.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig3}}\n\\caption{\\small Comparison between our VHS-band measurements (m$_0$) and measurements from the catalog that came with the VHS data \\citep[m$_{\\text{McMahon}}$;][]{Mcmahon2012} for a random subset of $\\approx$ 900 stars. $J$ is shown in \\textit{black}, $H$ in \\textit{green}, and $K_s$ in \\textit{red}.

Instead, we compute the BCS band zeropoints ourselves using the stellar locus regression (SLR) code Big MACS \\citep{Kelly2014}\\footnote{code.google.com/p/big-macs-calibrate}.  This code calibrates the photometric zeropoints by creating a model stellar locus for every input filter and fitting them simultaneously to a selection of input stars.  To input the best possible selection of stars for this purpose, we use a combination of several criteria that are fine-tuned for each tile to balance between quality and quantity. These include selecting stars using Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:stars}), SExtractor \\texttt{FLAGS} = 0, \\texttt{CLASS\\_STAR} $\\geq$ 0.9, \\texttt{A\\_IMAGE/B\\_IMAGE} $\\geq$ 0.8, \\texttt{FWHM\\_IMAGE} within a certain range from the point-source limit, and selecting bright, but unsaturated fluxes. \n\nOur star selection results in a mean of 525 stars used per tile. We run the code using the BCS bands ($g$, $r$, $i$, $z$) plus $J$ and $H$. Since the VHS bands ($J$, $H$, $K_s$) already have accurate zeropoints, we use the code to compute the zeropoints of the other 5 bands relative to $H$. This allows us to do an independent check on the code by comparing the code's value for the $J$ zeropoint with the actual $J$ zeropoint. We find that the mean difference between the two is 0.0078 mags, which is close to the uncertainty of the code. The mean uncertainties in the derived zeropoint calibrations are 0.043, 0.037, 0.018, 0.012, and 0.0052 mags for $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $J$, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Photometric Fitting}\n\\label{sec:photfit}\n\nHaving obtained a calibrated catalog of sources, we then apply an initial set of cuts to remove cases that are too uncertain to be suitable for stacking.   Our goal here is not to select a statistically-complete set of large, old, passive, $z \\geq 0.5$ galaxies in the survey area, but rather to select a subset of such galaxies that can be cleanly identified.  To count any source as reliable, we first require that it triggers no SExtractor output flags (\\texttt{FLAGS} = 0).  This choice excludes: (i) sources that have neighbors bright enough to bias the photometry; (ii) sources that were originally blended with another source;  (iii) sources with at least one saturated pixel; (iv) sources with incomplete or corrupted data; and (v) sources for which a memory overflow occurred when measuring their flux.  Furthermore, we remove all sources with a measured \\texttt{FLUXERR\\_APER} $\\leq0$ in any band, and any source within 3 $\\times$ \\texttt{FWHM\\_IMAGE} from the edge of a tile, since the data becomes unreliable near these boundaries due to dithering.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig5}}\n\\caption{\\small Sky distribution of our final selected galaxies for $0.5\\leq z \\leq 1.0$ (\\textit{black}) and $1.0 < z \\leq 1.5$ (\\textit{red}).}\n\\label{fig:skyplot}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nNext, we separate stars from galaxies by making use of the $gzK_s$ method given by Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:stars}).   As in the plot of model galaxies (lower-right panel of Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:candidates}), our data (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:gzk}) shows a clear division between the galaxy locus and the stellar locus along this limit.   Note however that  \\citet{Arcila-Osejo2013} proposed a star cut of $(z-K_s) < 0.45(g-z)-0.57$, which differs from ours slightly. Furthermore, we apply Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:passivecut}) to separate out young, lower-redshift galaxies from the $z\\geq 0.5$ old, passive galaxies we are interested in. After applying these criteria, we are left with a catalog of 332,037 sources consisting of 123,567 stars (37\\%) and 208,470 galaxies (63\\%), 195,426 (59\\%) of which satisfy Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:passivecut}).\nWe then correct for Galactic dust extinction using the \\cite{Schlegel1998} dust map\\footnote{http://w.astro.berkeley.edu/$\\sim$marc/dust/data/data.html} and the extinction curve of \\cite{Fitzpatrick1999}. Source-count histograms of the $K_s$ magnitudes for stars and the corrected $K_s$ magnitudes for galaxies are shown by the solid black and dashed blue lines, respectively, in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:khisto}.\n\n\nWith our catalog of galaxies we use the EAZY software package  \\citep{Brammer2008} to estimate photometric redshifts and the FAST software package \\citep{Kriek2009} to estimate various characteristics such as redshift, age, mass, and star formation rate (SFR). First, EAZY steps through a grid of redshifts, fits linear combinations of template spectra to our photometric data, and ultimately finds the best estimate for redshift, including optional flux- and redshift-based priors. We  allow for fits to make use of linear combinations of up to two of the default template spectra, and also apply the default $K$-band flux- and redshift-based prior derived from the  GOODS-Chandra Deep Field-South \\citep{Wuyts2008}.\n\n\nThe resulting redshifts are then fed into the FAST code, along with our seven-band photometric data, to fit for six additional parameters: age, mass, star formation timescale $\\tau$, SFR, dust content, and metallicity.  FAST allows for a range of parameters when generating  model fluxes, and in this analysis we choose: (i) a stellar population synthesis model as in \\cite{Conroy2010}; (ii) a \\cite{Chabrier2003} initial stellar mass function; (iii) an exponentially declining star formation history $\\propto \\exp(-t/\\tau)$; and (iv) a dust extinction law as given by  \\cite{Kriek2013}.  To determine the best-fit parameters, the code simply determines the $\\chi^2$ of every point of the model cube and finds the minimum.\nWhile the code allows for confidence intervals calibrated using Monte-Carlo simulations, here we simply make use of the best-fit values for each galaxy, recording its $\\chi^2$ for use in our final galaxy selections, described in \\S\\ref{sec:fingal}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig6}}\n\\caption{\\small Normalized $K_s$ band magnitude histograms of our identified stars (\\textit{black solid}), galaxies (\\textit{blue dashed}), and final selected galaxies\nat low redshift (\\textit{dotted red line}) and high redshift (\\textit{dot-dashed green line}). Galaxy magnitudes have been corrected for dust extinction, as discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:photfit}.}\n\\label{fig:khisto}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Final Galaxy Selection}\n\\label{sec:fingal}\n\nTo select the final galaxies used to measure the tSZ signal, we first cut out the least reliable FAST model fits by requiring $\\chi^2 \\leq 5$. Motivated by $\\S$\\ref{sec:gas} and $\\S$\\ref{sec:galselect}, we then select galaxies with ages $\\geq$ 1 Gyr and masses $\\geq 10^{11} M_\\odot$. To remove any presently star-forming galaxies, we also require the specific star formation rate SSFR $ \\equiv$ SFR/mass $\\leq 0.01$ Gyr$^{-1}$ \\citep{Kimm2012}. This insures that we  select massive, old, and quiescent galaxies. We further split the resulting galaxies into two redshift ranges, $0.5\\leq z \\leq 1.0$ (``low-$z$'') and $1.0 < z \\leq 1.5$ (``high-$z$''). Applying these constraints results in 4537 galaxies at low-$z$ and 1259 galaxies at high-$z$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{fig7a} \\quad\n\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{fig7b}}\n\\caption{\\small Redshift, age, and mass distributions for our final $z=0.5-1.0$ (\\textit{black solid lines}), and $z=1.0-1.5$ (\\textit{blue dashed lines}) galaxies.}\n\\label{fig:histos}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur final step is to remove any galaxies known to be a likely contamination to the tSZ signal we are interested in, due to: (i) the presence of a dusty Galactic molecular cloud;\n(ii) the presence of an AGN; (iii) the presence of a galaxy with strong dust emission; or (iv) the presence of a galaxy cluster, such that the tSZ signal would be dominated by the intracluster medium rather than the circumgalactic medium in which we are interested. Thus, we cut out any galaxy that was within 4 arcminutes of any source found within a large number of external source catalogs, chosen to remove all such sources. Regarding these external source catalogs, to exclude the presence of Galactic molecular clouds, we remove sources correlated with the Planck Catalogue of Galactic Cold Clumps \\citep{PlanckCollaboration2015c}. To exclude the presence of bright AGN, we remove sources correlated with the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source, Correlation, and Faint Source Catalogs \\citep{Voges1999}.  To exclude strong dust emitting sources, we remove sources correlated with the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources \\citep{PlanckCollaboration2014}, the SPT-SZ Point Source Catalog \\citep{Mocanu2013},  the  AKARI/FIS All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalogue \\citep{Yamamura2010}, the AKARI/IRC All-Sky Survey Point Source Catalog \\citep{Ishihara2010}, the IRAS Point Source Catalog \\citep{IRAS1988},  and all sources classified as Hot DOGs  from the WISE All-Sky Data Release Source Catalog \\citep{Wright2010}. Hot DOGs are defined as sources detected in WISE bands W3 or W4 but not in either W1 or W2 \\citep[e.g.][]{Eisenhardt2012}. Finally, to exclude sources in galaxy clusters, we remove sources correlated with the Planck Catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich Sources \\citep{PlanckCollaboration2015b} and the SPT-SZ Cluster Catalog \\citep{Bleem2015}.\n\n\n\nWe also carry out additional co-adds removing sources correlated with three radio surveys in addition to the cuts above, in order to further exclude potential bright AGN. These were the Australia Telescope 20 GHz Survey Source Catalog \\citep{Murphy2010}, the Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) Southern Survey Source Catalog \\citep{Wright1994}, and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) Source Catalog \\citep{Mauch2003}. We find that these additional cuts did not significantly change our results, as explained further in \\S \\ref{sec:coadd}.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of using all of these external catalogs is to increase the reliability of our galaxy catalog, which we maximize by aggressively using every external source catalog relevant for potential contamination. This process is imperfect, though, due to the completeness limits of the external catalogs we use as well as the restriction of only using existing publicly available catalogs. We implicitly account for the residual contamination left over from our imperfect contamination removal in \\S \\ref{sec:sptcont}, where we model what the impact of this undetected contamination is on our measurements.\n\n\n\nApplying these cuts results in our final sample of galaxies: 3394  at low-$z$ and 924 at high-$z$. Their distribution on the sky is shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:skyplot}, where we can perhaps start to see signs of large-scale structure.  Histograms of the $K_s$ magnitudes for these final two groups are shown  in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:khisto}. Their locations in color-space are plotted in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:gzk}.  Several things are evident in this figure. First, in the $gzK_{s}$-plot the stars clearly  separate out  from the galaxies  (red line and  Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:stars}) showing the quality  of our photometry. Secondly, we can see that the  blue line (Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:passivecut}) used to pare down the sample and select old and quiescent galaxies is, in  fact, a conservative cut  with respect to the  results of the SED fitting, i.e. there are very few red or blue points near the blue line. The upper two plots show the results before and after correction for Galactic extinction \\citep{Schlegel1998}. These plots show that making the color-cuts before applying  this correction does not introduce any substantial contamination of our  final sample that is selected after the SED fitting stage.\n\n\nFig.\\ \\ref{fig:histos} shows the redshift, age, and mass distributions of our final galaxy selection.   We can see that the number of galaxies as a function of mass is dominated by the lowest mass galaxies, although there are fewer of the fainter, lower mass galaxies detected in the higher redshift range.  Notice also that the oldest galaxies are found in the lower redshift bin, as expected.  To allow for ease of comparison between our results and theoretical models, mean values for redshift, $l_{\\text{ang}}^2$, mass, age, and $K_s$-band luminosity, as well as mass-averaged values of redshift and $l_{\\text{ang}}^2$, are shown for both redshift subsets in Table \\ref{tab:meanvals}.   The mean and mass-averaged redshifts and luminosity distances are very close to each other, indicating no strong evolution of the mass distribution within each redshift bin.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{12cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\t\\hline\n\t$z$ & $\\left< z \\right>$ & $\\left< l_{\\text{ang}}^2 \\right>$ & $\\left< \\text{M} \\right>$ & $\\left< \\text{Age} \\right>$ & $\\left< \\text{L}_{Ks} \\right>$ & $\\left< z \\right> _\\text{M}$ & $\\left< l_{\\text{ang}}^2 \\right> _\\text{M}$ \\\\\n\t  &  & Gpc$^2$ & M$_\\odot$ & Gyr & erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ &  & Gpc$^2$ \\\\ \\hline\n\t  $0.5-1.0$ & 0.72 & 2.30 & 1.51 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ & 4.34 & 2.78 $\\times 10^{30}$ & 0.72 & 2.30 \\\\\n\t  $1.0-1.5$ & 1.17 & 3.02 & 1.78 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ & 2.64 & 4.07 $\\times 10^{30}$ & 1.19 & 3.03 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small Mean and mass-averaged values for several relevant galaxy parameters in the two final redshift ranges.}\n\\label{tab:meanvals}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Measuring the tSZ Signal}\n\\label{sec:tszsig}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{SPT-SZ Filtering}\n\\label{sec:filter}\n\nAs discussed in \\S \\ref{sec:gas}, the signal we are looking for occurs on arcminute scales, comparable to the resolution of the SPT-SZ data we are working with. On the other hand, the overall anisotropy of the CMB is dominated by the primary signal, which is strongest on degree scales.\nFor this reason it is essential for us to filter our maps before obtaining our measurements.\nSince we are making measurements on the smallest scales (approaching the beam size), we apply a filter to the SPT-SZ data in order to optimize point-source measurements. This optimal filter in Fourier-space, $\\psi$, is \\citep{Schaffer2011}\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 39348, "prevtext": "\nwhere $g,$ $z,$ and $K_s$ are AB magnitudes, we are able to separate the galaxies we are interested in from Galactic stars. \nFurthermore, by applying a cut \n\n", "index": 35, "text": "\\begin{equation} \n(z-K_s)  \\leq 2 (g-z) - 0.7,\n\\label{eq:passivecut}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E18.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"(z-K_{s})\\leq 2(g-z)-0.7,\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>z</mi><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mo>\u2264</mo><mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>-</mo><mi>z</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>0.7</mn></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01330.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $\\tau$ is the Fourier-space source profile and $P$ is the Fourier-space noise power spectrum, which is the  sum of the (squared) instrument-plus-atmosphere power spectral density and the primary CMB power spectrum.

Thus we expect our primary signal, which we measure in a 1 arcminute radius aperture around our stacked galaxies, to be minimally affected by our filtering. The resulting optimal point source filters for the 150 GHz and 220 GHz bands are shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filt}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig8}}\n\\caption{\\small Optimal azimuthally-averaged filter curves in $\\ell$-space for both SPT bands.

Before we are able to measure a signal from these averages, however, we first need to correct for a bias introduced by our removal of all sources within 4 arcminutes of contaminating sources.   Because the SPT-SZ maps themselves are normalized to a mean of 0, and all of the contaminating sources introduce positive signal into the maps, the average value in the uncontaminated regions of the maps is slightly biased to negative values. We therefore calculate a bias for the ``contaminant-free'' images by choosing 140,000 random points in our field (chosen so that there are not more random points than possible beams on the sky) and subjecting the points to the same contaminating-source cuts as our galaxies. We then take the resulting 107,561 random points and compute the mean sums within a 1 arcminute radius around each point. With these values we calculated an offset value needed to re-normalize the mean to 0. These offset values were $0.24 \\pm 0.09$ and $0.58 \\pm 0.13$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ at 150 and 220 GHz, respectively.\n\nWe then sum and average the total signal within 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 arcminute radius apertures around our sources and add the offset, scaling them appropriately for the different aperture sizes. The 0.5 arcminute radius aperture represents roughly the size of the 150 GHz and 220 GHz beam FWHMs, which are 1.15 arcmin and 1.05 arcmin, respectively. Additionally, we calculate the standard deviation for each of these measurements by finding the standard deviation of the same size co-added region around an equal number of random points in our field, subjected to the same contaminating source cuts. The offset uncertainties are also included but are negligible. The final co-add values for each aperture size and redshift range are given in Table \\ref{tab:coadds}. The final galaxy co-add images for both redshift ranges are shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:coaddims}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9a} \\quad\n\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9b}}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9c} \\quad\n\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9d}}\n\\caption{\\small Final co-added galaxy images. \\textit{Left}: 150 GHz. \\textit{Right}: 220 GHz. \\textit{Top}: $0.5 \\leq z \\leq 1.0$. \\textit{Bottom}: $1.0 \\leq z \\leq 1.5$. The images are 8 $\\times$ 8 arcmin (33 $\\times$ 33 pixels). They represent the region where we have rejected any contaminating sources (see \\S\\ref{sec:fingal}). The black circles represent a 1 arcmin radius aperture.\\\\}\n\\label{fig:coaddims}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe upper left panel of this figure shows a clear $\\approx 1$ arcmin size $\\approx 2\\sigma$ negative feature centered directly on our stack of low-$z$ galaxies, with a magnitude consistent with a significant  tSZ signal.  Moreover, the low-$z$ 220 GHz measurements show a strong positive signal centered on our co-added sources.  \nBecause the tSZ effect has a negligible impact at this frequency, this indicates that  despite our cuts on detected contaminating sources, there still remains a significant positive contaminating signal at 220 GHz, made up of the sum of fainter sources. Looking at the emission by the typical range of dust temperatures at $z=1$ (light blue and dark blue curves in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}), the CMB spectrum (green curve in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}), and the frequencies of our SPT measurements (rightmost red hatched regions in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}), it appears likely that this contaminating signal at 220 GHz extends into the 150 GHz band, meaning that the true tSZ signal for the lower-redshift galaxies we have selected is even more negative than the values in Table \\ref{tab:coadds}.\n\nMoving to the higher redshift stacks shown in the bottom panel of Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:coaddims}, we find that the stacked emission of our galaxies in the 150 GHz map is consistent with zero signal.  However, as this band measures the sum of the (negative) tSZ and the (positive) contaminating sources, it is difficult to interpret these results without also considering the high-$z$ 220 GHz measurements.   As in the lower redshift case, this band shows a clear excess, but now at a magnitude that is roughly twice that seen \nin the low-$z$ stack.  This suggests that, because it is more difficult to identify contaminating sources at higher redshift, the high-$z$ 150 GHz measurement is more contaminated than the lower-redshift measurement, covering up the negative signal in which we are interested.    In both redshift ranges, however, it is clear that obtaining the best possible constraints on AGN feedback requires making the best possible separation between the tSZ signal and the contaminating signal, a topic we address in detail below. Finally, we can convert our co-added $\\Delta T$ signal into gas thermal energy using Eq. (\\ref{eq:newEthrm}). These values (using a 1 arcminute radius aperture) are shown in Table \\ref{tab:finvals}, under ``Data only''.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{12cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n$z$ & Band & 0.5 arcmin & 1 arcmin & 1.5 arcmin & 2 arcmin\\\\\n  & GHz  &  $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ & $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ & $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ & $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$\\\\ \\hline\n 0.5 - 1.0 & 150  & -0.53 $\\pm$ 0.26 & -1.5 $\\pm$ 0.7 & -2.3  $\\pm$ 1.3 & -2.7  $\\pm$ 1.9 \\\\              \n 0.5 - 1.0 & 220  & 0.85  $\\pm$ 0.53 & 3.0  $\\pm$ 1.4  & 5.4   $\\pm$ 2.3 & 6.4   $\\pm$ 3.0 \\\\     \n 1.0 - 1.5  & 150 & 0.39  $\\pm$ 0.49 & 1.6  $\\pm$ 1.4  & 2.8   $\\pm$ 2.5 & 3.2   $\\pm$ 3.7 \\\\    \n 1.0 - 1.5 & 220  & 2.6    $\\pm$ 1.0 & 6.3    $\\pm$ 2.7  & 7.9   $\\pm$ 4.4 & 7.4   $\\pm$ 5.7  \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular} }\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small Final co-added signals.

After these additional cuts, the number of final galaxies becomes 2,219 for our low-$z$ subset and 614 for our high-$z$ subset. The resulting co-add values for a 1 arcminute radius aperture are: $-1.7 \\pm 0.9$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 150 GHz low-$z$, $2.4 \\pm 1.7$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 220 GHz low-$z$, $0.9 \\pm 1.7$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 150 GHz high-$z$, and $10.4 \\pm 3.3$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 220 GHz high-$z$. We find that the additional radio source cuts do not significantly change our results except for an increased positive signal at 220 GHz in the high-$z$ subset, though they do increase the noise in our measurements because we are co-adding a smaller number of galaxies. As a result, we do not use the radio source cuts in our modeling and analysis below, though the higher 220 GHz signal in the high-$z$ subset may suggest a more significant tSZ detection in our high-$z$ results.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Removing Residual Contamination}\n\\label{sec:sptcont}\n\n\n\nIn order to constrain the impact that undetected contaminating sources have on our tSZ measurements, we built a detailed model of contaminants\nbased on an extrapolation of the SPT source counts measured in \\citet{Mocanu2013}.\nOur approach is to extend these counts to fainter values by modeling a random population of undetected sources that follow the trend of the detected sources into the unresolved region,\nwhich we then  relate to the contaminating signal in both our 150 GHz and 220 GHz measurements. \n\nFollowing \\citet{Mocanu2013} we separate contaminants into  synchrotron sources, which emit most at lower frequencies, and \ndusty sources, which emit most at higher frequencies.   For each source population we model the number counts as a power law, \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 61868, "prevtext": "\nwe can also separate  passively evolving galaxies from young galaxies over the full redshift range in which we are interested.   Taken together, these results make clear that if we focus on the redshift range $0.5-1.5,$ we should be able to efficiently select a large number of suitable galaxies from the BCS and VHS data that we are using.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Creating a Catalog of Galaxies}\n\\label{sec:galcat}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Image Matching}\n\\label{sec:matching}\n\nAs seen in  Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:candidates},  the sources we are interested in are brightest in the $K_s$ band, and thus we use it to make all of our detections. Because  the BCS and VHS tiles are different sizes and in different locations (see Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:tiles}), we consider every possible overlap between images when aligning the other data to the $K_s$ tiles.   We then match pixel sizes and locations, and to insure that fixed aperture flux measurements are consistent between bands, we also match the seeing between the $K_s$ tiles and the other bands.\n\nIf the $K_s$ tile has worse seeing than the other band, we simply degrade the other image with a Gaussian filter until it matches\nthe FWHM of the $K_s$ image.  On the other hand,  if the $K_s$ image has better seeing, we degrade it to match the other band, compute the ratio of 3-arcsec-diameter aperture fluxes between the two bands described below, and finally multiply the ratio by the  3-arcsec-diameter flux measured from the unconvolved $K_s.$  That is, we compute and apply an aperture correction as  Flux$_{grizJH}$ = Flux$_{grizJH,0}$ $\\times$ (Flux$_{K_s,0}$ / Flux$_{K_s,\\text{degraded}}$), where $0$ denotes the non-degraded measurement.  This is done to preserve both accurate colors and the best possible $K_s$ flux in every case, since that is the most important band for our purposes. Note that, since the seeing is nearly the same for all tiles ($\\approx 1$ arcsec, see Table \\ref{tab:bands}), this correction is minor, with a mean ratio (Flux$_{K_s,0}$ / Flux$_{K_s,\\text{degraded}}$) of 1.026 across all tiles.\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{14cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\t\\hline\n\tConfiguration parameter & Value & Configuration parameter & Value \\\\ \\hline\n\t\\texttt{DETECT\\_TYPE} & ccd & \\texttt{PHOT\\_AUTOPARAMS} & 2.5,3.5 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DETECT\\_MINAREA} & 4 & \\texttt{PHOT\\_AUTOAPERS} & 0.0,0.0 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{THRESH\\_TYPE} & relative & \\texttt{SATUR\\_LEVEL} & 32,000 (VHS) \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DETECT\\_THRESH} & 3.0 &  & 20,000 (BCS) \\\\\n\t\\texttt{ANALYSIS\\_THRESH} & 3.0 & \\texttt{GAIN} & 4.2 (VHS)  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{FILTER} & y &  & 0 (BCS) \\\\\n\t\\texttt{FILTER\\_NAME} & gauss\\_3.0\\_3x3.conv & \\texttt{PIXEL\\_SCALE} & 0 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DEBLEND\\_NTHRESH} & 32 & \\texttt{BACKPHOTO\\_TYPE} & local  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{DEBLEND\\_MINCONT} & 0.005 & \\texttt{BACKPHOTO\\_THICK} & 24  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{CLEAN} & y & \\texttt{BACK\\_TYPE} & auto  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{CLEAN\\_PARAM} & 1.0 & \\texttt{BACK\\_VALUE} & 3.0  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{MASK\\_TYPE} & correct & \\texttt{BACK\\_SIZE} & 64 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{WEIGHT\\_TYPE} & map\\_weight & \\texttt{BACK\\_FILTERSIZE} & 3 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{WEIGHT\\_GAIN} & n & \\texttt{BACK\\_FILTERTHRESH} & 0.0  \\\\\n\t\\texttt{RESCALE\\_WEIGHTS} & y & \\texttt{MEMORY\\_OBJSTACK} & 10,000 \\\\\n\t\\texttt{PHOT\\_APERTURES} & 9 & \\texttt{MEMORY\\_PIXSTACK} & 1,500,000 \\\\\n\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular} }\n\\end{center}\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\\caption{\\small SExtractor input parameters for all $K_s$-aligned tiles.}\n\\label{tab:sex}\t\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Detecting and Measuring Sources}\n\\label{sec:sex}\n\nTo detect and measure every object in our field, we use the SExtractor software package, version 2.8.6 \\citep{Bertin1996}\\footnote{SExtractor v2.13 User's manual, E. Bertin}$^{, }$\\footnote{https://www.astromatic.net/pubsvn/software/sextractor/ trunk/doc/sextractor}. The code detects and measures sources in an image through the following five step process:\n(i) it creates a background map that estimates the noise at every pixel in the image; (ii)  it detects sources using a thresholding technique; (iii) it uses a multiple isophotal analysis technique to deblend objects; (iv) it throws out spurious detections made in the wings of larger objects; and (v) it estimates the flux of each remaining object.  Each of these steps can be adjusted by the user through configuration parameters, and we list our choice of these parameters for both BCS and VHS tiles in Table \\ref{tab:sex}.\n\nIn all cases, we use SExtractor's dual-image mode, which allows us to measure fluxes in all bands from sources detected in the $K_s$ band. This results in a catalog of $K_s$-detected sources with \\texttt{MAG\\_AUTO} and 3-arcsec-diameter aperture flux measurements in every band.  We use corrected  \\texttt{MAG\\_AUTO} for our final catalogs and the 3-arcsec-diameter aperture  \\texttt{MAG\\_APER} to compute aperture corrections as described in \\S\\ref{sec:matching}. Finally, the overlap between tiles within both the BCS and VHS images leads to some sources being detected in multiple tiles.  To correct for this, we match our catalog with itself and  remove multiple occurrences of sources within 1 arcsec of each other. At this point in the analysis, our full catalog contains 565,561 sources, 168,944 (30\\%) of which are identified as duplicates. This leaves 396,617 total sources.\n\n\nTo confirm the reliability of our measurements, we compare our  $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ magnitudes with the source catalog released with the public VHS data. In particular, we  select stars from our catalog using Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:stars}), with $<$ instead of $\\geq,$ and SExtractor \\texttt{FLAGS} = 0 and match them with a random 10,000 source subset of the pre-made VHS catalog, where we define a match as  two sources within 0.5 arcsec of each other.  Note that our magnitudes are measured within 3-arcsec-diameter apertures while the pre-made catalog uses $2.83$-arcsec-diameter apertures.\nA plot of the difference in magnitudes between our catalog and the pre-made VHS catalog can be seen in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:vhscompare}. To remove extreme outliers, magnitudes from both catalogs are cut at the depths given in Table \\ref{tab:bands}. The mean offsets from 0 in the magnitude differences are -0.11, -0.05, and -0.03 mags for $J$, $H$, and $K_s$, respectively. The mean photometric uncertainty in those offsets across all magnitudes are $\\pm$0.09, $\\pm$0.12, and $\\pm$0.18 mags, respectively. The solid lines in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:vhscompare} represent the mean uncertainty within magnitude bins of width 1 mag, and they are plotted as positive offsets from 0 on the $y$-axis. The uncertainty includes any differences in the measurement process between this paper and \\citet{Mcmahon2012}, as well as the inherent uncertainty in the SExtractor measurements. As can be seen, the difference in magnitudes is reasonably within the uncertainty.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig3}}\n\\caption{\\small Comparison between our VHS-band measurements (m$_0$) and measurements from the catalog that came with the VHS data \\citep[m$_{\\text{McMahon}}$;][]{Mcmahon2012} for a random subset of $\\approx$ 900 stars. $J$ is shown in \\textit{black}, $H$ in \\textit{green}, and $K_s$ in \\textit{red}.

Instead, we compute the BCS band zeropoints ourselves using the stellar locus regression (SLR) code Big MACS \\citep{Kelly2014}\\footnote{code.google.com/p/big-macs-calibrate}.  This code calibrates the photometric zeropoints by creating a model stellar locus for every input filter and fitting them simultaneously to a selection of input stars.  To input the best possible selection of stars for this purpose, we use a combination of several criteria that are fine-tuned for each tile to balance between quality and quantity. These include selecting stars using Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:stars}), SExtractor \\texttt{FLAGS} = 0, \\texttt{CLASS\\_STAR} $\\geq$ 0.9, \\texttt{A\\_IMAGE/B\\_IMAGE} $\\geq$ 0.8, \\texttt{FWHM\\_IMAGE} within a certain range from the point-source limit, and selecting bright, but unsaturated fluxes. \n\nOur star selection results in a mean of 525 stars used per tile. We run the code using the BCS bands ($g$, $r$, $i$, $z$) plus $J$ and $H$. Since the VHS bands ($J$, $H$, $K_s$) already have accurate zeropoints, we use the code to compute the zeropoints of the other 5 bands relative to $H$. This allows us to do an independent check on the code by comparing the code's value for the $J$ zeropoint with the actual $J$ zeropoint. We find that the mean difference between the two is 0.0078 mags, which is close to the uncertainty of the code. The mean uncertainties in the derived zeropoint calibrations are 0.043, 0.037, 0.018, 0.012, and 0.0052 mags for $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $J$, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Photometric Fitting}\n\\label{sec:photfit}\n\nHaving obtained a calibrated catalog of sources, we then apply an initial set of cuts to remove cases that are too uncertain to be suitable for stacking.   Our goal here is not to select a statistically-complete set of large, old, passive, $z \\geq 0.5$ galaxies in the survey area, but rather to select a subset of such galaxies that can be cleanly identified.  To count any source as reliable, we first require that it triggers no SExtractor output flags (\\texttt{FLAGS} = 0).  This choice excludes: (i) sources that have neighbors bright enough to bias the photometry; (ii) sources that were originally blended with another source;  (iii) sources with at least one saturated pixel; (iv) sources with incomplete or corrupted data; and (v) sources for which a memory overflow occurred when measuring their flux.  Furthermore, we remove all sources with a measured \\texttt{FLUXERR\\_APER} $\\leq0$ in any band, and any source within 3 $\\times$ \\texttt{FWHM\\_IMAGE} from the edge of a tile, since the data becomes unreliable near these boundaries due to dithering.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig5}}\n\\caption{\\small Sky distribution of our final selected galaxies for $0.5\\leq z \\leq 1.0$ (\\textit{black}) and $1.0 < z \\leq 1.5$ (\\textit{red}).}\n\\label{fig:skyplot}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nNext, we separate stars from galaxies by making use of the $gzK_s$ method given by Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:stars}).   As in the plot of model galaxies (lower-right panel of Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:candidates}), our data (Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:gzk}) shows a clear division between the galaxy locus and the stellar locus along this limit.   Note however that  \\citet{Arcila-Osejo2013} proposed a star cut of $(z-K_s) < 0.45(g-z)-0.57$, which differs from ours slightly. Furthermore, we apply Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:passivecut}) to separate out young, lower-redshift galaxies from the $z\\geq 0.5$ old, passive galaxies we are interested in. After applying these criteria, we are left with a catalog of 332,037 sources consisting of 123,567 stars (37\\%) and 208,470 galaxies (63\\%), 195,426 (59\\%) of which satisfy Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:passivecut}).\nWe then correct for Galactic dust extinction using the \\cite{Schlegel1998} dust map\\footnote{http://w.astro.berkeley.edu/$\\sim$marc/dust/data/data.html} and the extinction curve of \\cite{Fitzpatrick1999}. Source-count histograms of the $K_s$ magnitudes for stars and the corrected $K_s$ magnitudes for galaxies are shown by the solid black and dashed blue lines, respectively, in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:khisto}.\n\n\nWith our catalog of galaxies we use the EAZY software package  \\citep{Brammer2008} to estimate photometric redshifts and the FAST software package \\citep{Kriek2009} to estimate various characteristics such as redshift, age, mass, and star formation rate (SFR). First, EAZY steps through a grid of redshifts, fits linear combinations of template spectra to our photometric data, and ultimately finds the best estimate for redshift, including optional flux- and redshift-based priors. We  allow for fits to make use of linear combinations of up to two of the default template spectra, and also apply the default $K$-band flux- and redshift-based prior derived from the  GOODS-Chandra Deep Field-South \\citep{Wuyts2008}.\n\n\nThe resulting redshifts are then fed into the FAST code, along with our seven-band photometric data, to fit for six additional parameters: age, mass, star formation timescale $\\tau$, SFR, dust content, and metallicity.  FAST allows for a range of parameters when generating  model fluxes, and in this analysis we choose: (i) a stellar population synthesis model as in \\cite{Conroy2010}; (ii) a \\cite{Chabrier2003} initial stellar mass function; (iii) an exponentially declining star formation history $\\propto \\exp(-t/\\tau)$; and (iv) a dust extinction law as given by  \\cite{Kriek2013}.  To determine the best-fit parameters, the code simply determines the $\\chi^2$ of every point of the model cube and finds the minimum.\nWhile the code allows for confidence intervals calibrated using Monte-Carlo simulations, here we simply make use of the best-fit values for each galaxy, recording its $\\chi^2$ for use in our final galaxy selections, described in \\S\\ref{sec:fingal}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig6}}\n\\caption{\\small Normalized $K_s$ band magnitude histograms of our identified stars (\\textit{black solid}), galaxies (\\textit{blue dashed}), and final selected galaxies\nat low redshift (\\textit{dotted red line}) and high redshift (\\textit{dot-dashed green line}). Galaxy magnitudes have been corrected for dust extinction, as discussed in \\S\\ref{sec:photfit}.}\n\\label{fig:khisto}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Final Galaxy Selection}\n\\label{sec:fingal}\n\nTo select the final galaxies used to measure the tSZ signal, we first cut out the least reliable FAST model fits by requiring $\\chi^2 \\leq 5$. Motivated by $\\S$\\ref{sec:gas} and $\\S$\\ref{sec:galselect}, we then select galaxies with ages $\\geq$ 1 Gyr and masses $\\geq 10^{11} M_\\odot$. To remove any presently star-forming galaxies, we also require the specific star formation rate SSFR $ \\equiv$ SFR/mass $\\leq 0.01$ Gyr$^{-1}$ \\citep{Kimm2012}. This insures that we  select massive, old, and quiescent galaxies. We further split the resulting galaxies into two redshift ranges, $0.5\\leq z \\leq 1.0$ (``low-$z$'') and $1.0 < z \\leq 1.5$ (``high-$z$''). Applying these constraints results in 4537 galaxies at low-$z$ and 1259 galaxies at high-$z$.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{fig7a} \\quad\n\\includegraphics[height=6cm]{fig7b}}\n\\caption{\\small Redshift, age, and mass distributions for our final $z=0.5-1.0$ (\\textit{black solid lines}), and $z=1.0-1.5$ (\\textit{blue dashed lines}) galaxies.}\n\\label{fig:histos}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nOur final step is to remove any galaxies known to be a likely contamination to the tSZ signal we are interested in, due to: (i) the presence of a dusty Galactic molecular cloud;\n(ii) the presence of an AGN; (iii) the presence of a galaxy with strong dust emission; or (iv) the presence of a galaxy cluster, such that the tSZ signal would be dominated by the intracluster medium rather than the circumgalactic medium in which we are interested. Thus, we cut out any galaxy that was within 4 arcminutes of any source found within a large number of external source catalogs, chosen to remove all such sources. Regarding these external source catalogs, to exclude the presence of Galactic molecular clouds, we remove sources correlated with the Planck Catalogue of Galactic Cold Clumps \\citep{PlanckCollaboration2015c}. To exclude the presence of bright AGN, we remove sources correlated with the ROSAT All-Sky Survey Bright Source, Correlation, and Faint Source Catalogs \\citep{Voges1999}.  To exclude strong dust emitting sources, we remove sources correlated with the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources \\citep{PlanckCollaboration2014}, the SPT-SZ Point Source Catalog \\citep{Mocanu2013},  the  AKARI/FIS All-Sky Survey Bright Source Catalogue \\citep{Yamamura2010}, the AKARI/IRC All-Sky Survey Point Source Catalog \\citep{Ishihara2010}, the IRAS Point Source Catalog \\citep{IRAS1988},  and all sources classified as Hot DOGs  from the WISE All-Sky Data Release Source Catalog \\citep{Wright2010}. Hot DOGs are defined as sources detected in WISE bands W3 or W4 but not in either W1 or W2 \\citep[e.g.][]{Eisenhardt2012}. Finally, to exclude sources in galaxy clusters, we remove sources correlated with the Planck Catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich Sources \\citep{PlanckCollaboration2015b} and the SPT-SZ Cluster Catalog \\citep{Bleem2015}.\n\n\n\nWe also carry out additional co-adds removing sources correlated with three radio surveys in addition to the cuts above, in order to further exclude potential bright AGN. These were the Australia Telescope 20 GHz Survey Source Catalog \\citep{Murphy2010}, the Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) Southern Survey Source Catalog \\citep{Wright1994}, and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) Source Catalog \\citep{Mauch2003}. We find that these additional cuts did not significantly change our results, as explained further in \\S \\ref{sec:coadd}.\n\n\n\nThe purpose of using all of these external catalogs is to increase the reliability of our galaxy catalog, which we maximize by aggressively using every external source catalog relevant for potential contamination. This process is imperfect, though, due to the completeness limits of the external catalogs we use as well as the restriction of only using existing publicly available catalogs. We implicitly account for the residual contamination left over from our imperfect contamination removal in \\S \\ref{sec:sptcont}, where we model what the impact of this undetected contamination is on our measurements.\n\n\n\nApplying these cuts results in our final sample of galaxies: 3394  at low-$z$ and 924 at high-$z$. Their distribution on the sky is shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:skyplot}, where we can perhaps start to see signs of large-scale structure.  Histograms of the $K_s$ magnitudes for these final two groups are shown  in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:khisto}. Their locations in color-space are plotted in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:gzk}.  Several things are evident in this figure. First, in the $gzK_{s}$-plot the stars clearly  separate out  from the galaxies  (red line and  Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:stars}) showing the quality  of our photometry. Secondly, we can see that the  blue line (Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:passivecut}) used to pare down the sample and select old and quiescent galaxies is, in  fact, a conservative cut  with respect to the  results of the SED fitting, i.e. there are very few red or blue points near the blue line. The upper two plots show the results before and after correction for Galactic extinction \\citep{Schlegel1998}. These plots show that making the color-cuts before applying  this correction does not introduce any substantial contamination of our  final sample that is selected after the SED fitting stage.\n\n\nFig.\\ \\ref{fig:histos} shows the redshift, age, and mass distributions of our final galaxy selection.   We can see that the number of galaxies as a function of mass is dominated by the lowest mass galaxies, although there are fewer of the fainter, lower mass galaxies detected in the higher redshift range.  Notice also that the oldest galaxies are found in the lower redshift bin, as expected.  To allow for ease of comparison between our results and theoretical models, mean values for redshift, $l_{\\text{ang}}^2$, mass, age, and $K_s$-band luminosity, as well as mass-averaged values of redshift and $l_{\\text{ang}}^2$, are shown for both redshift subsets in Table \\ref{tab:meanvals}.   The mean and mass-averaged redshifts and luminosity distances are very close to each other, indicating no strong evolution of the mass distribution within each redshift bin.\n\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{12cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\t\\hline\n\t$z$ & $\\left< z \\right>$ & $\\left< l_{\\text{ang}}^2 \\right>$ & $\\left< \\text{M} \\right>$ & $\\left< \\text{Age} \\right>$ & $\\left< \\text{L}_{Ks} \\right>$ & $\\left< z \\right> _\\text{M}$ & $\\left< l_{\\text{ang}}^2 \\right> _\\text{M}$ \\\\\n\t  &  & Gpc$^2$ & M$_\\odot$ & Gyr & erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ &  & Gpc$^2$ \\\\ \\hline\n\t  $0.5-1.0$ & 0.72 & 2.30 & 1.51 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ & 4.34 & 2.78 $\\times 10^{30}$ & 0.72 & 2.30 \\\\\n\t  $1.0-1.5$ & 1.17 & 3.02 & 1.78 $\\times$ 10$^{11}$ & 2.64 & 4.07 $\\times 10^{30}$ & 1.19 & 3.03 \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small Mean and mass-averaged values for several relevant galaxy parameters in the two final redshift ranges.}\n\\label{tab:meanvals}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Measuring the tSZ Signal}\n\\label{sec:tszsig}\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{SPT-SZ Filtering}\n\\label{sec:filter}\n\nAs discussed in \\S \\ref{sec:gas}, the signal we are looking for occurs on arcminute scales, comparable to the resolution of the SPT-SZ data we are working with. On the other hand, the overall anisotropy of the CMB is dominated by the primary signal, which is strongest on degree scales.\nFor this reason it is essential for us to filter our maps before obtaining our measurements.\nSince we are making measurements on the smallest scales (approaching the beam size), we apply a filter to the SPT-SZ data in order to optimize point-source measurements. This optimal filter in Fourier-space, $\\psi$, is \\citep{Schaffer2011}\n\n", "index": 37, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\psi = \\frac{\\tau}{P} \\left[ \\int d^2k \\frac{\\tau^2}{P} \\right]^{-1} ,\n\\label{eq:psi}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E19.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\psi=\\frac{\\tau}{P}\\left[\\int d^{2}k\\frac{\\tau^{2}}{P}\\right]^{-1},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mi>\u03c8</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><mi>\u03c4</mi><mi>P</mi></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" symmetric=\"true\">\u222b</mo><mrow><msup><mi>d</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>k</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mfrac><msup><mi>\u03c4</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mi>P</mi></mfrac></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01330.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $dN/dS$ is the number of sources between flux $S$ and $S + dS$, $N_0$ is an overall amplitude, $\\alpha$ is the power-law slope,\nand $S_{\\rm max}$ is the flux at which all brighter sources have a 100\\% completeness level in the source count catalog.\n We then compute a range of allowed source count slopes from the \\citet{Mocanu2013} data,  by carrying out a $\\chi^2$ fit in log-space.\n Our best-fit slopes at 150 GHz were $\\alpha_s = -2.05 \\pm 0.04$ for the synchrotron sources  and $\\alpha_d = -2.70 \\pm 0.19$ for the dusty sources.\n\nNote that our calculated values for $\\alpha_d$ are much steeper than $\\alpha_s$, meaning that while the number density of detected sources is dominated by synchrotron sources, the number density of undetected sources is likely to be dominated by dusty emitters.   Note also that $\\alpha_d$  and $\\alpha_s$  are sufficiently steep that the number of sources diverges as $S$ goes to 0, meaning that the source count distribution must fall off below some as-yet undetected flux.   For simplicity, we model this fall-off as a minimum flux $S_{\\rm min}$ below which there are no contaminating sources associated with the galaxies we are stacking.  \n\nFor any choice of $\\alpha_d,$ $\\alpha_s,$ and $S_{\\rm min}$ (which we will call a ``source-count model''), we are then able to construct a model population of contaminating source fluxes through a four-step procedure as follows:\n(i) for each model source, we randomly decide whether it is a synchrotron source or a dusty source, such that the overall fraction of detectable dusty sources to synchrotron sources matches the observed source counts;\n(ii)  we then assign the source a random 150 GHz flux, $S_{\\rm 150, rand},$ by inverting \n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 70871, "prevtext": "\nwhere $\\tau$ is the Fourier-space source profile and $P$ is the Fourier-space noise power spectrum, which is the  sum of the (squared) instrument-plus-atmosphere power spectral density and the primary CMB power spectrum.

Thus we expect our primary signal, which we measure in a 1 arcminute radius aperture around our stacked galaxies, to be minimally affected by our filtering. The resulting optimal point source filters for the 150 GHz and 220 GHz bands are shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filt}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=8cm]{fig8}}\n\\caption{\\small Optimal azimuthally-averaged filter curves in $\\ell$-space for both SPT bands.

Before we are able to measure a signal from these averages, however, we first need to correct for a bias introduced by our removal of all sources within 4 arcminutes of contaminating sources.   Because the SPT-SZ maps themselves are normalized to a mean of 0, and all of the contaminating sources introduce positive signal into the maps, the average value in the uncontaminated regions of the maps is slightly biased to negative values. We therefore calculate a bias for the ``contaminant-free'' images by choosing 140,000 random points in our field (chosen so that there are not more random points than possible beams on the sky) and subjecting the points to the same contaminating-source cuts as our galaxies. We then take the resulting 107,561 random points and compute the mean sums within a 1 arcminute radius around each point. With these values we calculated an offset value needed to re-normalize the mean to 0. These offset values were $0.24 \\pm 0.09$ and $0.58 \\pm 0.13$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ at 150 and 220 GHz, respectively.\n\nWe then sum and average the total signal within 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 arcminute radius apertures around our sources and add the offset, scaling them appropriately for the different aperture sizes. The 0.5 arcminute radius aperture represents roughly the size of the 150 GHz and 220 GHz beam FWHMs, which are 1.15 arcmin and 1.05 arcmin, respectively. Additionally, we calculate the standard deviation for each of these measurements by finding the standard deviation of the same size co-added region around an equal number of random points in our field, subjected to the same contaminating source cuts. The offset uncertainties are also included but are negligible. The final co-add values for each aperture size and redshift range are given in Table \\ref{tab:coadds}. The final galaxy co-add images for both redshift ranges are shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:coaddims}.\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9a} \\quad\n\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9b}}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9c} \\quad\n\\includegraphics[height=6.5cm]{fig9d}}\n\\caption{\\small Final co-added galaxy images. \\textit{Left}: 150 GHz. \\textit{Right}: 220 GHz. \\textit{Top}: $0.5 \\leq z \\leq 1.0$. \\textit{Bottom}: $1.0 \\leq z \\leq 1.5$. The images are 8 $\\times$ 8 arcmin (33 $\\times$ 33 pixels). They represent the region where we have rejected any contaminating sources (see \\S\\ref{sec:fingal}). The black circles represent a 1 arcmin radius aperture.\\\\}\n\\label{fig:coaddims}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe upper left panel of this figure shows a clear $\\approx 1$ arcmin size $\\approx 2\\sigma$ negative feature centered directly on our stack of low-$z$ galaxies, with a magnitude consistent with a significant  tSZ signal.  Moreover, the low-$z$ 220 GHz measurements show a strong positive signal centered on our co-added sources.  \nBecause the tSZ effect has a negligible impact at this frequency, this indicates that  despite our cuts on detected contaminating sources, there still remains a significant positive contaminating signal at 220 GHz, made up of the sum of fainter sources. Looking at the emission by the typical range of dust temperatures at $z=1$ (light blue and dark blue curves in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}), the CMB spectrum (green curve in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}), and the frequencies of our SPT measurements (rightmost red hatched regions in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}), it appears likely that this contaminating signal at 220 GHz extends into the 150 GHz band, meaning that the true tSZ signal for the lower-redshift galaxies we have selected is even more negative than the values in Table \\ref{tab:coadds}.\n\nMoving to the higher redshift stacks shown in the bottom panel of Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:coaddims}, we find that the stacked emission of our galaxies in the 150 GHz map is consistent with zero signal.  However, as this band measures the sum of the (negative) tSZ and the (positive) contaminating sources, it is difficult to interpret these results without also considering the high-$z$ 220 GHz measurements.   As in the lower redshift case, this band shows a clear excess, but now at a magnitude that is roughly twice that seen \nin the low-$z$ stack.  This suggests that, because it is more difficult to identify contaminating sources at higher redshift, the high-$z$ 150 GHz measurement is more contaminated than the lower-redshift measurement, covering up the negative signal in which we are interested.    In both redshift ranges, however, it is clear that obtaining the best possible constraints on AGN feedback requires making the best possible separation between the tSZ signal and the contaminating signal, a topic we address in detail below. Finally, we can convert our co-added $\\Delta T$ signal into gas thermal energy using Eq. (\\ref{eq:newEthrm}). These values (using a 1 arcminute radius aperture) are shown in Table \\ref{tab:finvals}, under ``Data only''.\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{12cm}{!}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n$z$ & Band & 0.5 arcmin & 1 arcmin & 1.5 arcmin & 2 arcmin\\\\\n  & GHz  &  $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ & $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ & $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ & $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$\\\\ \\hline\n 0.5 - 1.0 & 150  & -0.53 $\\pm$ 0.26 & -1.5 $\\pm$ 0.7 & -2.3  $\\pm$ 1.3 & -2.7  $\\pm$ 1.9 \\\\              \n 0.5 - 1.0 & 220  & 0.85  $\\pm$ 0.53 & 3.0  $\\pm$ 1.4  & 5.4   $\\pm$ 2.3 & 6.4   $\\pm$ 3.0 \\\\     \n 1.0 - 1.5  & 150 & 0.39  $\\pm$ 0.49 & 1.6  $\\pm$ 1.4  & 2.8   $\\pm$ 2.5 & 3.2   $\\pm$ 3.7 \\\\    \n 1.0 - 1.5 & 220  & 2.6    $\\pm$ 1.0 & 6.3    $\\pm$ 2.7  & 7.9   $\\pm$ 4.4 & 7.4   $\\pm$ 5.7  \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular} }\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\small Final co-added signals.

After these additional cuts, the number of final galaxies becomes 2,219 for our low-$z$ subset and 614 for our high-$z$ subset. The resulting co-add values for a 1 arcminute radius aperture are: $-1.7 \\pm 0.9$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 150 GHz low-$z$, $2.4 \\pm 1.7$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 220 GHz low-$z$, $0.9 \\pm 1.7$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 150 GHz high-$z$, and $10.4 \\pm 3.3$ $\\mu$K arcmin$^2$ for 220 GHz high-$z$. We find that the additional radio source cuts do not significantly change our results except for an increased positive signal at 220 GHz in the high-$z$ subset, though they do increase the noise in our measurements because we are co-adding a smaller number of galaxies. As a result, we do not use the radio source cuts in our modeling and analysis below, though the higher 220 GHz signal in the high-$z$ subset may suggest a more significant tSZ detection in our high-$z$ results.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Removing Residual Contamination}\n\\label{sec:sptcont}\n\n\n\nIn order to constrain the impact that undetected contaminating sources have on our tSZ measurements, we built a detailed model of contaminants\nbased on an extrapolation of the SPT source counts measured in \\citet{Mocanu2013}.\nOur approach is to extend these counts to fainter values by modeling a random population of undetected sources that follow the trend of the detected sources into the unresolved region,\nwhich we then  relate to the contaminating signal in both our 150 GHz and 220 GHz measurements. \n\nFollowing \\citet{Mocanu2013} we separate contaminants into  synchrotron sources, which emit most at lower frequencies, and \ndusty sources, which emit most at higher frequencies.   For each source population we model the number counts as a power law, \n\n", "index": 39, "text": "\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dN}{dS} = \\frac{N_0}{S_{\\rm max}} \\left(\\frac{S}{S_{\\rm max}}\\right)^{\\alpha},\n\\label{eq:dnds}\n\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E20.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"\\frac{dN}{dS}=\\frac{N_{0}}{S_{\\rm max}}\\left(\\frac{S}{S_{\\rm max}}\\right)^{%&#10;\\alpha},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>N</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>S</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mrow><mfrac><msub><mi>N</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>max</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>\u2062</mo><msup><mrow><mo>(</mo><mfrac><mi>S</mi><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>max</mi></msub></mfrac><mo>)</mo></mrow><mi>\u03b1</mi></msup></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}, {"file": "1601.01330.tex", "nexttext": "\nwhere $R \\in \\left[0,1\\right]$ is a random number, \nsuch that their overall population matches the source count slopes.

This excludes models in which a good fit to the data can only be achieved by moving $f_{\\text{cont}}$ outside the range of physically possible values.\n\nEq.\\ (\\ref{eq:probmod}) then gives us a function $P(S_{\\text{SZ}})$ for each combination of $\\alpha_d,$ $\\alpha_s,$ and $S_{\\rm min}$. We can convert the corresponding $S_{\\text{SZ}}$ value to the gas thermal energy, $E_\\text{therm},$ using Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:newEthrm}) and the average $l^2_\\text{ang}$ from Table \\ref{tab:meanvals}.

Furthermore, in both redshift bins, the best fit values are higher than expected from models that do not include AGN energy input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Removing Residual Contamination Using Planck Data}\n\\label{sec:planckcont}\n\nIn order to better constrain the impact of dusty contaminating sources on our measurements, we made use of the 2015 public data release from the Planck mission, focusing on the high-frequency bands at 857, 545, 353, and 217 GHz (see the rightmost black hatched regions in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}). While the FWHM beam size for this data is about 5 arcminutes \\citep{PlanckCollaboration2015e}, and thus  too low-resolution to detect the tSZ signal in which we are interested, the data provides information at the higher frequencies at which the dusty sources should be much brighter (i.e. the light blue and dark blue curves in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:filters}). Therefore these measurements have the potential to discriminate between contaminant models, allowing us to better remove this contribution from the tSZ signal.\n\nOur goal is to use this data to add terms to our $\\chi^2$ fit that quantify, for each source model, how consistent a given choice of $f_{\\rm cont}$ is with the Planck measurements.   To compute these extra $\\chi^2$ terms, we again constructed stacks of the data over each of our galaxies, but now, because of the lower resolution of the Planck data, we  extended our contaminant source cuts to within 10 arcminutes of known potentially contaminating sources. This resulted in a decreased number of final galaxies, now 937 at low-$z$ and 240 at high-$z$. In order to filter out the primary CMB signal, we convolved each map with a 7 arcminute FWHM Gaussian and subtracted the resulting map from the original. We then stacked the central pixels of every source to get co-added values for our galaxies in each of the Planck bands. In addition, we degraded the SPT 150 GHz and 220 GHz maps to match the beam size of Planck, applied the same 7 arcmin FWHM filtering, and stacked the galaxies on those images as well.\n\nAs was the case in \\S \\ref{sec:coadd},\nin all of these stacks there is an offset we need to correct for since we are purposely avoiding positive contaminations in the maps. To do this we also made measurements at 3,000 random points on the sky that were restricted to the same contaminating-source cuts as our galaxies. These measurements allowed us to compute offset values needed to re-normalize each band to a mean of 0, which we applied to our final measurements.\n\nFinally, we computed our measurement errors by using the random point measurements \\citep[since the proper noise covariance matrix is not provided, i.e.][]{PlanckCollaboration2015f}, corrected in two ways. First, because we account for the residual CMB primary signal in the $\\chi^2$ calculations as discussed below, we remove the error due to the CMB primary itself.   To estimate this contribution, we take 95\\% of the minimum covariance between the SPT 150 GHz and 220 GHz bands (filtered to match the Planck bands) and the Planck 217 GHz band, since these are mostly dominated by the CMB primary signal which will therefore be correlated between them. The minimum covariance is between the two SPT bands, and it is 7.85 $\\mu$K. Second, there is an error introduced due to our offset corrections because they are made from a large, but finite number of points. We then get the corrected error from\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 78615, "prevtext": "\nwhere $i$ and $j$ represent the bands, $S_{a,\\text{rand}}$ and $S_{b,\\text{rand}}$ represent the 1-arcminute radius aperture values for the random points, $N_{\\text{rand}} = 107,561$ is the number of random points used, and $N_{\\text{source}}$ is the number of galaxies used (3394 for low-$z$ and 924 for high-$z$).

However, unlike the primary CMB signal, the spectral shape of this foreground is similar to that of the dusty sources we are trying to constrain, and it cannot be removed by fitting it separately.  \n\nIn the same manner as the previous section, we modeled SPT-SZ 150 GHz and 220 GHz contaminant source fluxes using a range of different source-count models (i.e. $\\alpha_d,$ $\\alpha_s,$ and $S_{\\rm min}$), resulting again in 100,000 modeled contaminating source fluxes in each SPT band, $S_{150,\\text{cont}}$ and $S_{220,\\text{cont}}$.

The peak of each $P(S_{\\text{SZ}})$ curve is shown as the colored points in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:s150corrPlanck}, where the points are colored by the minimum $\\chi^2$ value for each model.  Note that the the best fit $\\chi^2$ values are smaller than expected for 4 degrees of freedom due to the correlations between the errors of the various frequency bands due primarily to foreground contamination by Galactic dust.\nThe 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ contours are created for each $S_{\\rm min}$ by averaging $P(S_{\\text{SZ}})$ across $\\alpha_d$ and $\\alpha_s$ and then dividing the final result by the single maximum value. 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ are again represented by the values 0.61 and 0.13, respectively. These contours are shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:s150corrPlanck}, along with the $\\pm1\\sigma$ range for $E_\\text{grav}$. From this figure we can see that the $\\sigma$ values have slightly decreased at both low-$z$ and high-$z$, especially at higher $S_{\\rm min}$ values for high-$z$. This is where the contaminants are hardest to constrain with just SPT, and where Planck data helps us the most.\n\nFinally, we average the probability distribution across $S_{\\rm min}$, divided by the maximum value again, and get a final distribution as a function of only $E_\\text{therm}$. The significance ($\\sigma$) values of this curve are shown in the ``With Planck'' part of Table \\ref{tab:finvals}. Planck has helped to constrain the tSZ signal, especially at high-$z$, although it is clear that the gain in sensitivity has been limited by the decrease in the number of galaxies in each redshift bin due to the much larger beam size of Planck compared to SPT.\n\nAlternatively, we can also characterize the total tSZ signal for our coadds with the angularly integrated Compton-$y$ parameter, $Y$ \\citep[e.g.][]{Ruan2015}. While we cannot directly compare peak Compton-$y$ values with past measurements, as these are beam-dependent quantities, we can compare the angularly integrated $Y$ values between our results and past experiments (see Table \\ref{tab:prevwork}).

If we estimate the stellar mass for the \\citet{Hand2011} results using Table \\ref{tab:prevwork} and Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:Mstellar}) we get $1.7\\times10^{12} M_\\odot$, which is about an order of magnitude greater than the average stellar mass of our galaxies. Our smaller values could be indicative of the relation that tSZ signal increases with halo (and stellar) mass \\citep[i.e.][]{Gralla2014}. Our low-$z$ result is within about 1$\\sigma$ of the \\citet{Gralla2014} $z\\approx 0.3$  SDSS radio-loud AGN result, though our $1.0 < z \\leq 1.5$ result of $1.7_ {-1.8}^{+2.2} \\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ is $> 3\\sigma$ higher than their $z\\approx 1.1$ FIRST AGN result. This discrepancy is not too significant because our high-$z$ detection is only at a 0.9$\\sigma$ confidence. Our results are also within $\\approx$$1\\sigma$ of \\citet{Greco2014} when comparing their results for galaxies with masses similar to ours. At smaller masses our results are consistent with theirs while at larger masses they find even greater tSZ signal, following the relation that tSZ signal increases with stellar mass.  \\citet{Ruan2015} also obtain values from stacks of SDSS quasars about an order of magnitude ($> 2\\sigma$) higher than ours, although, according to \\citet{Cen2015}, the maximum AGN feedback signal from \\citet{Ruan2015} can only be 25\\% of their quoted values. Furthermore, the  $\\approx 10^{11} M_\\odot$ galaxy results from \\citet{Ruan2015} are consistent with zero signal, while their $\\approx 3 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$ galaxy results are $>2\\sigma$ larger than ours. Their high mass sample represents almost 3 times the mean mass of our galaxies, though, so the larger values may be indicative of the stellar mass$-$tSZ signal relation  as well as the potential overestimation of the tSZ signal. We can compare our results to \\citet{Cen2015} by multiplying their average Compton-$y$ values over 1 arcmin by $\\pi \\times l_{\\text{ang}}^2$ (where $l_{\\text{ang}}^2 = 3.18 \\,\\text{Gpc}^2$ for $z=1.5$)  to get $Y$ values of $\\approx$ 6.8$\\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ for their halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, and $\\approx$ 4.2$\\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ for their \\citet[][CS]{Cen2015a} model, which places quasars in lower mass dark matter halos. This CS model value is within $\\approx$ 2$\\sigma$ of our results, and our measurements would favor the lower estimates of their CS model over their HOD model. Finally, both our low-$z$ and high-$z$ $E_\\text{therm}$ results are well within $1\\sigma$ of the \\citet{Crichton2015} SDSS radio-quiet quasar results.\n\nWith Eqs.\\ (\\ref{eq:Egrav}) and (\\ref{eq:EAGN}) and the redshifts and masses from Table \\ref{tab:meanvals}, we can also investigate theoretical thermal energies of the gas around elliptical galaxies due to both gravity and AGN feedback.  We estimate the gravitational heating energy to be $E_\\text{therm,grav} = 3.6_{-1.9}^{+3.6} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs for our low-$z$ sample and $E_\\text{therm,grav} = 3.0_{-1.6}^{+3.0}\\times 10^{60}$ ergs for our high-$z$ sample. We therefore measure excess non-gravitational energies (for our results using Planck) of $E_\\text{therm,feed,dat} = 4.0^{+3.6}_{-4.3} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs for low-$z$ and $E_\\text{therm,feed,dat} = 3.0^{+7.9}_{-7.0} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs for high-$z$. Plugging these into the theoretical AGN feedback energy equation and solving for $\\epsilon_{k}$, we get feedback efficiencies of $1.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$\\% for low-$z$ and $1.3^{+3.5}_{-3.1}$\\% for high-$z$. These values are very uncertain, though they do hint at feedback efficiencies slightly lower than the suggested 5\\% \\citep[i.e.][]{Scannapieco2005,Ruan2015}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Anderson-Darling Goodness-of-fit Test}\n\\label{sec:ad}\n\nThe measurements described above depend on co-adding data from a large number of sources.   In principle, however, there is additional information in the distribution of measured values that is lost through this process.   For example, imagine a set of 1001 150-GHz measurements, 1000 of which contributed a negative signal of -2 $\\mu K$ arcmin$^2$ and one of which contributed a positive signal of 2000 $\\mu K$ arcmin$^2$.  While the average value of these measurements would be zero, looking at the distribution of values would indicate strong evidence of a negative tSZ signal, offset by contamination from a single, overpowering positive source.   \n\nTo quantify the additional information available by the full distribution of SPT data, we apply the same contaminant source modeling described above (i.e. \\S \\ref{sec:sptcont}) and use a goodness-of-fit test, the Anderson-Darling (A-D) test \\citep{Anderson1954}, to find models that poorly fit the data.  In this case we restrict our attention purely to the $1$ arcmin resolution data used to construct Fig. \\ref{fig:coaddims}, without folding in the lower resolution Planck data as described in \\S \\ref{sec:planckcont}.  To perform the test, we run through every pair of galaxy measurements (i.e. the 1 arcmin radius aperture sums at both 150 GHz and 220 GHz) and find the fraction of galaxy measurements in each of the four quadrants around the pair of measurements (i.e. ($x<x_i, y<y_i$); ($x<x_i, y>y_i$); ($x>x_i, y<y_i$); ($x>x_i, y>y_i$); where $x$ and $y$ represent the co-add sum in each band, and $i$ runs through all the galaxies). We will call these fractions $f_{i,j}$ where $i$ specifies the galaxy ($i = [1,2,\\dots,n]$, with $n$ being the number of galaxies) and $j$ specifies the quadrant ($j = [1,2,3,4]$). In the same four quadrants we also find the fraction of model measurements, $F_{i,j}$. We therefore define our Anderson-Darling statistic as:\n\n", "itemtype": "equation", "pos": 94495, "prevtext": "\nwhere the whole function is normalized to a total of 1, and each final SZ value contains the sum over the corresponding $T_\\text{dust}$, $\\Delta$, and fractions from 0 to 1. Since in this case there are  8 terms contributing to $\\chi^2$ and 4 fit parameters, this leaves us with 4 degrees of freedom.\nThus the minimum $\\chi^2$ will not be 0 in every case as they were previously with just 2 parameters and 2 fit parameters, and so for each model we scale the final probabilities by $\\exp(-\\chi^2_{\\text{min}}/2)$, where $\\chi^2_{\\text{min}}$ is the minimum $\\chi^2$ value for that model.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[height=10cm]{fig12}}\n\\caption{\\small Plot of the contaminant-corrected $E_\\text{therm}$ (see Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:newEthrm})) for different choices of $\\alpha_{\\rm dust}$, $\\alpha_{\\rm sync}$, and $S_{\\rm min}$, incorporating the Planck bands. Points are located at the peak $\\chi^2$ probability for each model, and colored according to the minimum $\\chi^2$ value for that model. Their general locations are still indicative of their $\\alpha_d,$ $\\alpha_s,$ and $S_{\\rm min}$ values, as seen in Fig. \\ref{fig:s150corr}. The light and dark gray regions represent the complete span of $\\pm1\\sigma$ and $\\pm2\\sigma$, respectively, for all points. The hatched regions represent the $\\pm1\\sigma$ range for $E_\\text{grav}$ [see Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:Egrav})].}\n\\label{fig:s150corrPlanck}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThis again gives us a function $P(S_{\\text{SZ}})$ for each combination of $\\alpha_d,$ $\\alpha_s,$ and $S_{\\rm min}$, which we can convert to an energy $E_\\text{therm}$. The peak of each $P(S_{\\text{SZ}})$ curve is shown as the colored points in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:s150corrPlanck}, where the points are colored by the minimum $\\chi^2$ value for each model.  Note that the the best fit $\\chi^2$ values are smaller than expected for 4 degrees of freedom due to the correlations between the errors of the various frequency bands due primarily to foreground contamination by Galactic dust.\nThe 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ contours are created for each $S_{\\rm min}$ by averaging $P(S_{\\text{SZ}})$ across $\\alpha_d$ and $\\alpha_s$ and then dividing the final result by the single maximum value. 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ are again represented by the values 0.61 and 0.13, respectively. These contours are shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:s150corrPlanck}, along with the $\\pm1\\sigma$ range for $E_\\text{grav}$. From this figure we can see that the $\\sigma$ values have slightly decreased at both low-$z$ and high-$z$, especially at higher $S_{\\rm min}$ values for high-$z$. This is where the contaminants are hardest to constrain with just SPT, and where Planck data helps us the most.\n\nFinally, we average the probability distribution across $S_{\\rm min}$, divided by the maximum value again, and get a final distribution as a function of only $E_\\text{therm}$. The significance ($\\sigma$) values of this curve are shown in the ``With Planck'' part of Table \\ref{tab:finvals}. Planck has helped to constrain the tSZ signal, especially at high-$z$, although it is clear that the gain in sensitivity has been limited by the decrease in the number of galaxies in each redshift bin due to the much larger beam size of Planck compared to SPT.\n\nAlternatively, we can also characterize the total tSZ signal for our coadds with the angularly integrated Compton-$y$ parameter, $Y$ \\citep[e.g.][]{Ruan2015}. While we cannot directly compare peak Compton-$y$ values with past measurements, as these are beam-dependent quantities, we can compare the angularly integrated $Y$ values between our results and past experiments (see Table \\ref{tab:prevwork}).

In order to interpret our results, we follow the same process, but instead of using data from our selected galaxies we use a random subset of the modeled sources, with the subset containing the same number of elements as the number of galaxies we are using for both redshift ranges. We do this 200 times each for four different combinations of $S_{\\rm min}$, $\\alpha_{\\rm dust}$, and $\\alpha_{\\rm sync}$. We then define our confidence of the model fits, $P(<S_{AD})$, as the fraction of these subset calculations that are less than the corresponding $S_{AD}$. When defined in this way, $P$ indicates our confidence that the model is not a good fit with the data. The fractions correspond to $\\sigma$ in the standard way (i.e. 1$\\sigma$ = 0.68, 2$\\sigma$ = 0.95, etc.).\n\nAs mentioned above, we only do these subset calculations for four sets of model parameters, which is due to the time-intensive nature of these computations. To get confidence values for every other set of model parameters, we simply do a linear interpolation between the four sets of model parameters we did use. The results are shown in Fig.\\ \\ref{fig:testfigs}. They reveal that models with both the highest $S_{\\text{min}}$ and the highest $\\alpha_{\\rm dust}$ are disfavored up to $\\approx 1.5\\sigma$ (87\\%) confidence, with the trend much more pronounced in the high-$z$ range.  On the other hand, unlike the analysis using the Planck data, the A-D test primarily serves to constraint $S_{\\text {min}}$ rather than $E_{\\rm thermal},$ meaning that it does not allow us to obtain significantly better constraints on feedback itself.  Finally, we note that we also carried out a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test \\citep[e.g.][]{Peacock1983} but it was far less constraining than the A-D test, and so we do not present it here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\nSince $z \\approx 2,$ star formation has occurred in progressively less massive galaxies, and AGN have occurred around progressively less massive black holes.  While these are fundamental observations of galaxy evolution,  a consensus has yet to be reached about the physical processes that dictate them.  The anti-hierarchical quenching of galaxies and AGN might be partially caused by stable virial shocks and gravitational heating due to infalling galaxies \\citep[e.g.][]{Feldmann2015}, but most successful models invoke additional energy input, most likely from AGN.   In fact, strong quasar activity is known to launch rapid outflows of gas, and powerful radio jets are observed to play an important role in galaxy clusters, but the total energy released by these processes as a function of redshift and environment remains largely unknown. As our understanding of galaxy formation increasingly relies on  understanding this feedback, it is apparent that we need increasingly sensitive observations to constrain it.\n\nAn extremely promising approach to making these constraints is co-adding the microwave background around a large number of sources to measure the signal imprinted by the tSZ effect.  Several recent studies have applied this approach, making detections of galaxies at low redshifts ($z \\lesssim 0.5$)  and AGN from $z=0$ to 3, as summarized in Table \\ref{tab:prevwork}. There are potential issues with each of these approaches, though. At low redshifts the additional gravitational heating from structure formation obscures the additional energy input from AGN, while working with AGN directly leads to problems of strong contamination from dust and synchrotron emission.  These have motivated us to choose massive ($> 10^{11} M_\\odot$) elliptical galaxies at moderate redshifts ($0.5 \\leq z \\leq 1.5$), where we expect these various limitations on the AGN feedback signal to be minimal, and to make our measurements using data from the South Pole Telescope, which has a $\\approx$ 1 arcmin beam size well matched to the expected sizes of heated regions.\n\nTo construct a catalog of such large, $0.5 \\leq z \\leq 1.5$ elliptical galaxies, we made use of data from the  Blanco Cosmology Survey in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$  bands, as well as  VISTA Hemisphere Survey  data in the $J$, $H$, and  $K_s$ bands over a $\\approx 43$ deg$^2$ area overlapping with the public SPT fields.  We separated galaxies from stars using a $gzK_s$ color cut, and for each of the galaxies, we fit stellar population synthesis models to limit the sample to the most massive, $z \\geq 0.5$ passive galaxies.   Furthermore, to limit the contamination of the tSZ signal, we removed all galaxies if they were within 4 arcminutes of a galaxy cluster, an active AGN, a dusty Galactic molecular cloud, or a galaxy with strong dust emission.  Finally, around the remaining sources, we co-added 150 GHz and 220 GHz SPT maps that were optimally filtered for point sources. This alone gave us a tSZ detection in our low-$z$ subset ($0.5 \\leq z \\leq 1.0$) 150 GHz band of $> 2\\sigma$ significance. At the same time, we also had a $> 2\\sigma$ contaminant signal in our low-$z$ 220 GHz band, which is expected to also extend to and contaminate the 150 GHz band.\n \nIn order to account for this contamination, we modeled the potential contaminating sources using the SPT point source number counts from \\citet{Mocanu2013}, extrapolated them between the two bands, and used $\\chi^2$ statistics to get best-fit values across all reasonable parameter choices. This improved our low-$z$ subset tSZ detection to $3.5\\sigma$ significance. To even further constrain the contamination in our measurements, we stacked our galaxies in the four highest Planck bands as well, rejecting galaxies within 10 arcminutes of potential contaminant sources. We again used $\\chi^2$ statistics to get best-fit values across all reasonable parameter choices, and found a low-$z$ subset tSZ detection at 3.6$\\sigma$ significance, as well as a $0.9 \\sigma$ measurement of the tSZ signal in the high-$z$ subset ($1.0 \\leq z \\leq 1.5$). A summary of all our results is found in Table \\ref{tab:finvals}.\n\nIn comparison with previous work measuring the tSZ signal around AGN, we find a similar and slightly larger ($\\approx 1\\sigma$) tSZ signal than the lower redshift results of \\citet{Gralla2014}, and a significantly larger ($> 3\\sigma$) signal than their higher redshift results. However, we find a much smaller  tSZ signal than both the high and low redshift results of \\citet{Ruan2015}, although it is suspected that their values are significantly overestimated \\citep[e.g.][]{Cen2015}. We also find a slightly smaller tSZ signal than the simulated results of \\citet{Cen2015}, and our results favor their CS model, which associates quasars with lower mass dark matter halos. Our $E_\\text{therm}$ results are consistent with \\citet{Crichton2015}. In comparison with previous work measuring the tSZ signal around galaxies, we find a signal that is about 3.5 times less than the more massive galaxies used by \\citet{Hand2011} which may be indicative of the stellar mass$-$tSZ signal relation. We find a signal within $\\approx1\\sigma$ of the similar-mass galaxy stacks of \\citet{Greco2014}, though our results are consistent with their results at lower masses. The lower mass \\citet{Ruan2015} galaxy signal is consistent with zero, while the higher mass ($\\approx 3$ times our mean mass) results are $>2\\sigma$ larger than ours. This may again reflect the mass$-$tSZ signal relation as well as their potential overestimation of the tSZ signal. Finally, our low redshift results suggest an AGN feedback efficiency of $1.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$\\%, which is a bit lower than the 5\\% value found in \\citet{Ruan2015} and suggested by, for example, \\citet{Scannapieco2005}.\n\nMeasurements such as the one described here are likely to improve significantly in the near future. While the  first public SPT-SZ data release (2011) covers a 95 deg$^2$ field with the 150 and 220 GHz bands, the upcoming full survey release will include a 2,500 deg$^2$ field using bands at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. The much larger field will allow for a much larger set of galaxies to be co-added, vastly improving the signal-to-noise of the measurements, while the additional 95 GHz band will also allow for further constraints on contaminating signals.  In addition to SPT, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has observed for four seasons from 2007 to 2011 using the Millimeter Bolometric Array Camera (MBAC) with bands at 148, 218, and 277 GHz, producing more than 90 TB of data \\citep{Dunner2013}. In 2012 they released a 780 deg$^2$ temperature map at 148 GHz\\footnote{http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/act\\_tmaps\\_info.cfm}, in 2014 they released a few thousand deg$^2$ at 148 and 218 GHz\\footnote{http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/act/act\\_maps2013\\_info .cfm}, and more fields using all 3 bands will be released in the future. Measuring galaxies using ACT can compliment work using SPT because they observe both different and overlapping regions of the sky. Furthermore, the higher frequency 277 GHz band can also provide important help in constraining contaminant signal.  In the future, separating out such contaminants will become even more practical, through surveys such as those to be undertaken by the upgraded ACT telescope (Advanced ACTPol) and the proposed Cerro Chajnantor Atacama Telescope (CCAT).\\footnote{http://www.ccatobservatory.org/}\n\n\nAnother approach to  constraining AGN feedback is through deep measurements of smaller samples of galaxies identified as the most interesting using large radio telescopes.  In this case rather than co-adding as many galaxies as possible, one would select a handful of the most promising galaxies for detecting AGN feedback. The Goddard IRAM Superconducting Two Millimeter Camera (GISMO)  and the New IRAM KIDs Array (NIKA) are powerful new instruments mounted on the Institute de Radioastronome Millimetrique (IRAM) 30 meter telescope\\footnote{http://www.iram-institute.org/EN/30-meter-telescope.php} that may prove useful for this purpose. Also promising is the National Radio Astronomy Observatories (NRAO) Green Bank Telescope (GBT),  whose Continuum Backend operates at lower frequencies where the tSZ signal is roughly three times larger.\nOn the other hand, interferometers appear to be less suited to constraining AGN heating, because they are more likely to resolve the affected regions and thus be limited by surface brightness concerns. Nevertheless, several interferometers may prove useful for AGN feedback studies, including the IRAM interferometer, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA),  and the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA).\n\nFinally, tSZ simulations and observations can be combined to produce weighted stacks that are adapted to be as sensitive as possible to the differences between feedback models.   This is because with a suite of simulations in hand, one can not only perform stacks of the tSZ signal around simulated galaxies with exactly the same mass, redshift, and age distribution as in a given observational sample, but also vary the weights applied to such stacks so as to arrive at the combination that allows for the observations to best discriminate between competing models.    We are only now beginning to map out the history of AGN feedback through measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich  effect.\n\n\n\nWe would like to thank Shantanu Desai, Mariska Kriek, Eliot Quataert, and Daniel Marrone for helpful discussions.

If we estimate the stellar mass for the \\citet{Hand2011} results using Table \\ref{tab:prevwork} and Eq.\\ (\\ref{eq:Mstellar}) we get $1.7\\times10^{12} M_\\odot$, which is about an order of magnitude greater than the average stellar mass of our galaxies. Our smaller values could be indicative of the relation that tSZ signal increases with halo (and stellar) mass \\citep[i.e.][]{Gralla2014}. Our low-$z$ result is within about 1$\\sigma$ of the \\citet{Gralla2014} $z\\approx 0.3$  SDSS radio-loud AGN result, though our $1.0 < z \\leq 1.5$ result of $1.7_ {-1.8}^{+2.2} \\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ is $> 3\\sigma$ higher than their $z\\approx 1.1$ FIRST AGN result. This discrepancy is not too significant because our high-$z$ detection is only at a 0.9$\\sigma$ confidence. Our results are also within $\\approx$$1\\sigma$ of \\citet{Greco2014} when comparing their results for galaxies with masses similar to ours. At smaller masses our results are consistent with theirs while at larger masses they find even greater tSZ signal, following the relation that tSZ signal increases with stellar mass.  \\citet{Ruan2015} also obtain values from stacks of SDSS quasars about an order of magnitude ($> 2\\sigma$) higher than ours, although, according to \\citet{Cen2015}, the maximum AGN feedback signal from \\citet{Ruan2015} can only be 25\\% of their quoted values. Furthermore, the  $\\approx 10^{11} M_\\odot$ galaxy results from \\citet{Ruan2015} are consistent with zero signal, while their $\\approx 3 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$ galaxy results are $>2\\sigma$ larger than ours. Their high mass sample represents almost 3 times the mean mass of our galaxies, though, so the larger values may be indicative of the stellar mass$-$tSZ signal relation  as well as the potential overestimation of the tSZ signal. We can compare our results to \\citet{Cen2015} by multiplying their average Compton-$y$ values over 1 arcmin by $\\pi \\times l_{\\text{ang}}^2$ (where $l_{\\text{ang}}^2 = 3.18 \\,\\text{Gpc}^2$ for $z=1.5$)  to get $Y$ values of $\\approx$ 6.8$\\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ for their halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, and $\\approx$ 4.2$\\times 10^{-7}$ Mpc$^2$ for their \\citet[][CS]{Cen2015a} model, which places quasars in lower mass dark matter halos. This CS model value is within $\\approx$ 2$\\sigma$ of our results, and our measurements would favor the lower estimates of their CS model over their HOD model. Finally, both our low-$z$ and high-$z$ $E_\\text{therm}$ results are well within $1\\sigma$ of the \\citet{Crichton2015} SDSS radio-quiet quasar results.\n\nWith Eqs.\\ (\\ref{eq:Egrav}) and (\\ref{eq:EAGN}) and the redshifts and masses from Table \\ref{tab:meanvals}, we can also investigate theoretical thermal energies of the gas around elliptical galaxies due to both gravity and AGN feedback.  We estimate the gravitational heating energy to be $E_\\text{therm,grav} = 3.6_{-1.9}^{+3.6} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs for our low-$z$ sample and $E_\\text{therm,grav} = 3.0_{-1.6}^{+3.0}\\times 10^{60}$ ergs for our high-$z$ sample. We therefore measure excess non-gravitational energies (for our results using Planck) of $E_\\text{therm,feed,dat} = 4.0^{+3.6}_{-4.3} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs for low-$z$ and $E_\\text{therm,feed,dat} = 3.0^{+7.9}_{-7.0} \\times 10^{60}$ ergs for high-$z$. Plugging these into the theoretical AGN feedback energy equation and solving for $\\epsilon_{k}$, we get feedback efficiencies of $1.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$\\% for low-$z$ and $1.3^{+3.5}_{-3.1}$\\% for high-$z$. These values are very uncertain, though they do hint at feedback efficiencies slightly lower than the suggested 5\\% \\citep[i.e.][]{Scannapieco2005,Ruan2015}.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Anderson-Darling Goodness-of-fit Test}\n\\label{sec:ad}\n\nThe measurements described above depend on co-adding data from a large number of sources.   In principle, however, there is additional information in the distribution of measured values that is lost through this process.   For example, imagine a set of 1001 150-GHz measurements, 1000 of which contributed a negative signal of -2 $\\mu K$ arcmin$^2$ and one of which contributed a positive signal of 2000 $\\mu K$ arcmin$^2$.  While the average value of these measurements would be zero, looking at the distribution of values would indicate strong evidence of a negative tSZ signal, offset by contamination from a single, overpowering positive source.   \n\nTo quantify the additional information available by the full distribution of SPT data, we apply the same contaminant source modeling described above (i.e. \\S \\ref{sec:sptcont}) and use a goodness-of-fit test, the Anderson-Darling (A-D) test \\citep{Anderson1954}, to find models that poorly fit the data.  In this case we restrict our attention purely to the $1$ arcmin resolution data used to construct Fig. \\ref{fig:coaddims}, without folding in the lower resolution Planck data as described in \\S \\ref{sec:planckcont}.  To perform the test, we run through every pair of galaxy measurements (i.e. the 1 arcmin radius aperture sums at both 150 GHz and 220 GHz) and find the fraction of galaxy measurements in each of the four quadrants around the pair of measurements (i.e. ($x<x_i, y<y_i$); ($x<x_i, y>y_i$); ($x>x_i, y<y_i$); ($x>x_i, y>y_i$); where $x$ and $y$ represent the co-add sum in each band, and $i$ runs through all the galaxies). We will call these fractions $f_{i,j}$ where $i$ specifies the galaxy ($i = [1,2,\\dots,n]$, with $n$ being the number of galaxies) and $j$ specifies the quadrant ($j = [1,2,3,4]$). In the same four quadrants we also find the fraction of model measurements, $F_{i,j}$. We therefore define our Anderson-Darling statistic as:\n\n", "index": 73, "text": "\\begin{equation} S_{AD} = n \\, \\sum \\frac{(f_{i,j}-F_{i,j})^2}{F_{i,j}(1-F_{i,j})} ,\\end{equation}\n", "mathml": "<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"S0.E37.m1\" class=\"ltx_Math\" alttext=\"S_{AD}=n\\,\\sum\\frac{(f_{i,j}-F_{i,j})^{2}}{F_{i,j}(1-F_{i,j})},\" display=\"block\"><mrow><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>\u2062</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mrow><mpadded width=\"+1.7pt\"><mi>n</mi></mpadded><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo largeop=\"true\" movablelimits=\"false\" symmetric=\"true\">\u2211</mo><mfrac><msup><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup><mrow><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2062</mo><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></mrow></mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow></math>", "type": "latex"}]
